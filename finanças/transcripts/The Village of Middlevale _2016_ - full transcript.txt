- Hey, I'm Dennis. I'm a fan of the middle ages. So, I bought a lot of land and this is what I do now. I just live here. We're good? Hi, I'm Jenna Smith. - I am Sophie Wolf. - My name is Peter Ward. - I'm Miles. - Treavor. - Louis. - My name is Liam, and I've been preparing for this, my entire life. - Jerry and I are about to take off for the village of Middlevale. - Just finished my last brochure. So yeah, all there is left is just to wait for people. - A forced survival situation, no supplies. I get to build my own shelter, gather food, everything I've always wanted to do. - I'm a third-year history student. I found this Middlevale village project on the internet. I figured I could swing this for like a full course load. - I've been in the ren-fair business for several years now, on a volunteer committee at a local ren-fair. I was just recently fired from said volunteer committee. How you fire a volunteer, I'll never know. - I'm an actress, I guess. I'm still trying to kind of make it. So I guess I'm trying to be an actress. - This is kind of me being a kid again. Growing up, you know, I was always swinging a plastic sword around. Now I get a real sword. - I work at a thrift store, and I started out as a cashier but quickly moved up to security. I responded to the ad, got really excited to put it on my calendar. And I've just been waiting and planning. - I think it's gonna be a perfect environment for him. There's going to be other people like him out there, all serving a purpose to build a productive community. And for a boy who's grown up and training to be a wizard, then I think it's a great place for him. And I just hope they're nice to him. - I recently have had some rough times. People don't really like me very much, and I'm sort of hoping that this will be a chance to reinvent yourself, you know? It's so hard to meet people nowadays, you know? You go out and people are just closed off. Women especially do not wanna talk to you. That's something I've noticed. - I know a lot about cathedral architecture. So, in theory, if we're doing like a big bill project like that, I could probably build a church for 'em. - I've done my own series of survival videos covering a whole bunch of different skills that I've obtained over my years of practice. Honestly, I feel like it's about time I get a good field test. - I'm really trying to discover myself and really explore who I am as an actor, really kind of go method. And this is my chance to do it. So I quit my job, I left my apartment, and I packed up all my things, and I'm gonna go live in Medieval village for a year. And... I'm really excited. I think it's gonna be a lot of fun because at this point, I have this many options. So, fingers crossed. It'll be great. - Okay, here we go. - All right. - You went potty, right? - Ah, yeah. - Okay. Seatbelt. - Here we go. - I may have been a little ambitious. I know, I know you wanna get around. But I don't know where I'm going, okay? - Most people when they try to go and be medieval, they dress up as lords and ladies with absolutely no expectations of the hardships that people really face there. I'm sure there's gonna be at least one person there like that. - I don't know where I'm going. This doesn't make any sense, it's not the way it is on here. It's not out there the way, the same way that it is on the map. - That's a big lawn. - Sure is. Wow. Jerry. - I can get those later. Yeah, yeah, I'll get 'em later. - I'm having some trouble. - With what? - Me, I think it's gonna be rough meeting people. - Listen, you're gonna be okay. - I'm gonna be okay. - All your training. Everything we've gone over, okay? All right. - I don't know if I'm ready for all this. This new, new stuff. - You are standing on the precipice of a new adventure. It's time for you to fly, sweetheart. - Okay. - I love you. - I love you too, Mom. - You're gonna be great. You're gonna do great things. - Hey, hey, hey, hello. Well, I'm here. What if they already have a purple wizard? That would be awkward. - Welcome, welcome. Welcome to Middlevale! Oh, wondrous. I'm very excited. We've got everybody here and we're all working. There've been a few miscommunications. So here we are. What do you think? - There's nothing around here. - Where's the village? - Well, this is, this is what I got so far by myself. - It turns out we're just a bunch of people in the woods. - I don't wanna say I'm disappointed but the ad said we were coming to a medieval village. And there's nothing here. Like there's nothing here. I understand, I get it that maybe I may have been misleading, but I thought it was pretty clear that we'll build it together. I didn't think villages were built by one single person. And then they go out and say, "hey, come here, the village is ready." And then a bunch of lazier people walk in. I don't think that ever happened. I don't think that's how villages were built. I thought people get together and they make things. They make things together as a group, as a team. Okay, I got some big dreams for this village here and I think we can build tons of stuff. - We're gonna build a village. - I just have a mirror and a hairbrush. So, how does, how is this gonna work? - Forge, forge, wagon, wagon. House, house. The cock just crowed, it is time to get up, come on everybody. We got a big day ahead of us. Arise, arise. - Yes, yes. I know that yesterday was rough, but it's supposed to be challenging. The middle ages weren't easy. And the difficulty will just add to the authenticity of our experience, right? Right, come on, come on, everybody. Let's get up. Let's wake up a little bit, okay? Right Look, I've got, I've got a full docket, okay? - Some of these people, a little concerned about, so I'm a lyrith they head of the North. She's this warrior and a princess maybe. Beautiful, smart, funny, strong. She seems simple to the other villagers, but she's a dark and mysterious past. I hate to bring this up, but could we talk for a moment about your skills and what you might do in the town? - I was thinking, perhaps I could, I could call me in with the forest, and find the edible herbs and berries. Perhaps befriend the animals here so that they will not attack our camp or steal our food. - Okay. - What? - Luck cos, I must away. - So I don't really have a job right now. I don't really know what to do. I mean, it's cool. You know, it's gonna be fun. I just, I don't really know how to help. - So what are your, what are your past experiences? What are you good at? - I had a question about that. I'm not the best at like, you know, people. - I've noticed. - Not very good at people. - Yes. - Yeah right, that's why I'm here. I wanna get better at it. - How good are you with scissors? Why don't we just set you up with barber? Would that be good for you? You can interact with people, anytime they needed a haircut. You could talk to them then. - That's probably an important job, right? - Yeah, it's a very important job. I can only trust to you. - This is gonna be awesome. - Hey. - Hello. - I need you to sign this. - Oh. - Name here and here. - My first Royal decree, yes. - Just, you know, real quick. Get it out of the way. Alrighty. My internship officially starts now. - You have to change the date, Christopher of Chitwood thinks it's 1369. He underlined 69. I'm kind of worried about my mom. I can't remember the last time I've been away, but I think I'll be fine. I think this is gonna be good still. Out in the woods, seems pretty nice. And it's a nice day. I'm staying warm for the most part. People haven't given me any, you know, terrible nicknames. - So apparently I've been deemed the village idiot. They took one look at my hat, and I am now Odd. - Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd, Odd. - It's a coy. It's very fashionable, warm all the time that everyone should be wearing this. Clearly, I'm the only one taking this seriously. - They is something I need to call all of our attentions to and that is accents, all right? We're in English village, we should all have an English accent. Odd, why don't you go first? - Very well. - Wrong, next person. You must be erect. The English were a very uncomfortable people, all right. Everybody have class, stood like this at all times. The English accent should just simply flow to let us just speak. - That is an hour. - I'm sitting by a fire. - From the earth, we come to the sea we shall go. - Lots of piece of work is man, thou art, the sun and I am not. - Perfect. - Thank you. - Let us try our accents on each other. Let us talk, converse, converse with your partner, converse with the person sitting next to you. Each of you in pairs. - Say yah, yes, say a word. Say instead of a boat, I say boata. - Across the mountains. - Across the mountains. - I've come a long way in just a little while. This is my accent. Hello, I am. I'm a British person. I sound British now. It's coming. It's definitely coming. You're gonna be learning from me soon. Say that for me, I am British. - I am British. Oh, look at that. - No, you aren't there? It has to go lower. - Okay, fine. - I am British. - I am British. - It was close. - Right? - You were close. - I think this has been a very productive day and we should all get back to doing whatever we were doing. - Hmm. Sorry, homme. Damn it, damn it. Hey. - Hey. - Hey, where'd you get this really nice wood? - I bought it. - Is Dennis okay with that? - No. Then how... Miles kind of a bad boy! He breaks the rules. - Who are you, who are you, who are you? - Who are you? - I'm a pizza guy. - Why are you here? - Someone ordered a pizza. Is this is this for real? Good morning - Ha, boy. Sound the horn. - All right. - Great! All right. It's finally becoming a place. Middlevalle is happening. It may not look like much, but it's really starting to feel like home. And we're getting more people by the day. Ben fish, the pizza guy who decided to stay on so the population's growing. It's so exciting and people are really starting to get into their characters. I'm really proud of everybody here. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a pint, in our inn, that we built, as a family. - The inn is a place where everybody comes to congregate to eat and drink and they didn't even have to vote, they knew right away, who should be the innkeeper. They were like, Sophie, you need to be the innkeeper. So upstairs, we have beds that people can rent. And, I serve food and drink. Except there's one problem, we don't have any alcohol, which is part of what the inn is supposed to be serving. So far, I've just been serving grape and apple juice, which nobody has seemed to notice. But I talked with Miles and I think he has a solution. - So Sophie asked me to make her some mead for the inn. So she came to the right place. I mean, I make mead, my dorm, whole time, you know, I've never done it on this scale. So that'll be new. It should be good in about eight weeks. - Hi, this is my, yes, this is my smithery. I got an anvil, hammer, some hot metal. Just throw that in the water. And it makes it snow ice, and everybody's like, ooh, blacksmiths doing his job. I've got this pumpy blowy thing. It blows air into the fire and makes it really hot. Smoking a lot. It's kind of hurting my throat, but this is kind of what I do now, you know? Yeah, I have no idea what I'm doing. When people walk past me, I give them a nice smile and I wave. And I lead them to believe that I know what I'm doing, but I don't. This used to be a horseshoe. - Dennis, Dennis, hey, hey, Dennis come here. - What? - Dennis, hey. I'm ready to open my barber surgery. - Oh, great. - Yeah, I wanna do, I ain't no good. Come here, come here. I wanna do like, I wanna do like a grand opening, like a big thing. - Like what do you mean? - Yeah, like a presentation, like a grand opening for all the people in the village. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, so get everybody together. Call all the people. When Dennis told me that he wanted me to be the barber of Middleville. I thought that was kind of like a throwaway job. It seemed pretty lame. But, in this children's book, I got, it says that the barbers in medieval times were actually the doctors. That means not only do I get to cut everybody's hair, but I also get to pull out teeth and I get to perform surgeries. This little guy in bed right there, he can't really, wait. Let me find a better picture. Here we go, look at that. That's the kind of stuff, I'm gonna be doing here in the village. Everybody's gonna be coming to me. You know, you go to the blacksmith when you need like a sword or something and you go to the inn, if you want like some disgusting porridge, but anytime you need anything, you come to the doctor, you know, you got a tooth ache, I'll give you some of this. You chew on it for a little while. You got like a, your foot gets these all gang greeny, I just cut it right off. I got knives, I got swords and stuff. This is gonna be incredible, look at these, they're terrifying. I can't wait to cut somebody's hair with these. Ladies and gentleman. I hope you all are sitting down because you're gonna faint if you're not because the barber surgeon is now open for business. So, whatever you need, you got the medical needs, you got the physical needs, or maybe that says all my data most you don't need. You come to me, I can help you with anything that you want. The psychological problems, boil problems, nose problems, I can fix any kind of problems you want. So who's the first to come up and get their hair cut? Come on, somebody wants a hair cut. - I want the first haircut. - Yes, step right up, you can't lead the village without a good hair cut. Make you're nice and comfortable. Okay? Yeah, okay here we go. Just to gonna take a little bit off of the top, maybe a little bit on the back. How about the shave after we're done. That's gonna be... Oh, - Just around the corner. - Thank you, good Sir Knight. - Not a problem, anything to get this ford's running. We'll need some decent steel. - Decent steel, yes. Oh, wait, good Sir Knight. I was thinking, you being the Knight of the town, you might need some help. Second in command, Squire? Yes, you need a Squire. - A Squire, yes. - A meek, but powerful brother in arms, that might have their back to perform on various duties. Just something to think about. - Yes, indeed. Thank you, Blacksmith. - Not a problem. I'll be here if you need me. Here working my humble forge. - Meek, powerful. That's what you need, that's me. - Barber surgeon, anybody wants some, I don't just do haircuts, you know. I got elixirs. Somebody wanna buy an elixir? Anybody? - Magic, magic for sale. Grand opening, magic sale. Ooh, hello? - Hello. - Hello. - These are beautiful. - Yes. - Oh, wow. - Wow, yes that one. That one is the brown recluse. The stripes keep away danger. I saw the barber surgeon selling stuff, I thought it looked fun. He had a whole crowd of people all around him and, and I wanted that. It seems to be working out really well. We got magical eggs. I think the Easter bunny would be a little bit envious, don't you? I don't know what this wizard's trying to pull. - All is well in the village of Middle Vale, except this is where I live. I'm just out here by myself in the cold and the rain. So things aren't going exactly as planned. I can't really think of anything to do other than brush my hair. I can't even do that anymore because my hair started to fall out because I've been brushing it too much. I'm kind of looking for change. Something's got to change, a character change. - Hello inn keeper? I'm an orphan noble, before land of the Queen. Might you have work for me? - Seriously? - I got tired of sleeping alone in the rain and the cold outside. Can you give me a job, please? - Sure. You can start with the table. - Seriously? This is gonna be great for my character development. She's like my evil stepmother. - Sophie doesn't have a point. We should really think about having an economy. Actually, this brings me to another point. Some things have been going missing lately. We've had some complaints around town about this. Cause somebody stole my blanket. - Yeah. - I think it's time we do something about it. - I'm on it. This nave will not see another day of navrey. - Wow! - Yah, okay. - Thank you. - This is my first day as village protector. And I already have a case. I won't let them down. I have the trusty sword and I'm not gonna sleep for days. I'm gonna stay up. I'll just watch like a hawk. They won't know what hit 'em. Are you the thief? - No. - Are you the thief? - No. - Are you the thief? - No. - Are you the thief? - No, but I've heard, - Are you the thief? - No. - Are you the thief? - No. - Are you the thief? - No. - I think it's gonna be way harder than I thought. - Good tonight, did you give any thought to my idea, the Squire idea? - Ben, do you wanna be my Squire? - Yes, oh, heck yes. - And are you the thief? I should have asked you that first. Son of a - With the combined efforts of both I and my new Squire, the thief will soon be thwarted. - Watch your language, young Squire. - Sorry. Can I show him the thing? - Yeah, show him the thing. - Hey, you down there, stop in the name of justice. - It's pretty cool. Yah. - Hey! - So I've noticed that not only is there a very high demand for haircuts, but there's also a pretty high demand in this village for more specialty items. Items that maybe aren't exactly of the period. I mean, Dennis may not approve of it, but what Dennis doesn't know, he should. - Hello Barber Surgeon. - Hey, isn't it a beautiful bar wench. - Thank you, it's lyrith, fair ahead of the North, noble woman, not a bar wench. Anyway, I was wondering if you could procure something for me? - Oh yeah, I get a lot of things. I can get you a porch and make your hair fall out, I can get you another porch and make your hair grow back. - I was thinking more of a specialty item? - Meet me over there. - We recently received some intel, from a viable source that there is a black market happening right here in Middlevale. - What do you want? - The red army approaches. - People are coming in with merchandise that's not... - Not good. - Not good - Not time period, at all. - For the period. - Thank God, thanks. - So we said, - We said, hey, we're on it. - We're on it. - So we got like a, a sting operation going, - operation sting, incognito. Staff attacks. Ouch, ouch, crap, I can't. How's it a, how's it going? - It's going fine. - Aha. - How are you? - I'm good, I'm good. Thanks for asking. Listen, I was a, wonder, get some things. - Well, I have plenty of things for sale. - Okay. - You'll have to come with me to the front. - Round that you were, you're sure? - Yeah. - Hey man, I'm cool. You were, you're cool. - Oh, I'm cool? Looking for a deal. Looking for a dealio, dealbob, dealrooney, dealscruro, deal, do little. - Well, I've got all sorts of things, but nothing's on sale today. - I'm looking for something a little more off the menu. That's the case may be - I don't do business that way. I don't have anything off the menu. - Okay man. - If I did, what would be the point of even having a menu? - Okay, someone told me that you were, you know, you were the guy. - Well, somebody told you wrong. - Okay, okay. - I think it's time for you to leave Ben. - Okay. - Another rock. There's another one. This is the third. The third privy, they've got me digging now, all right, why? Because no one else will dig it. No one, just Odd, I'd digs the perdit. What I should be doing, is I should be out there building my next survival shelter because, someone keeps destroying them. First one was burned, another was stumbled over, then sat on, fourth one the wind blew it over that's nobody's fault, not blaming anyone. And the fifth one, well, someone mistook it for a perdit. I don't know how much more of this I can take. - So we've got the full village up and running now, shortly after that, we realized that medieval life can be just, the tiniest bit boring and monotonous. It can only carry a scroll back and forth so many times a day before people catch on that, you're not really doing anything. So in order to spice things up, we're hosting a tournament. And this whole day is just gonna be about friendly, fun, where I think we'll all really bond together. It's gonna be a blast. - I need someone on flagged duty, the rest of you maneuver duty, shovel them. So we are about to have a tournament, it's very exciting, you know. I don't know, maybe this, this fair made could Visto kiss one of the victors. Depending on who he is, not that one. - A mysterious stranger has entered the archery competition. It's me. I think I wanna prove to everyone, just how tough I can really be. So, I'm really excited. - Ladies and countrymen, today, we start our sword fighting tournament. Betwixt, Sir Trevor, the just and beautiful and handsome and brave is he. And I'm assuming a barber, who has asked me to call him, barber, the butcher of Middlevale. - You win, you win. You win, you win. You're the winner, you win. You win. I said you win. - We have a winner. - Archery. - It is I, Elizabeth, the fair head of the North. For 1,000 years, my people were the greatest archers in the world. For 1,000 years, our arrows always struck through. - Sack race on. - Oh, thank God. - Thank you Sophie. - Of course. - Today's the day, that I think the medea here should be done. Let's see how we did. Yeah, I think we're good. I think we're gonna be good. - To me. - Yeah. - Hello everybody, I am throne clothed the purple. And today I am going to perform to you, a magnificent act. There's gonna be a little bit of a magic show, put on by myself. A little bit of wizarding showmanship. Let me channel the spirits. I don't think they're gonna know what hit 'em. I think they're gonna be pleasantly surprised. I'm a summon the flame from deep within. It is a very dangerous trick, I'm about to perform for all of you. - Sophie. Sophie. - Oh God, what? - Sophie. Sophie, come on. Sophie come here. - Watch the goats. - Close the door. - Come on. - What do you want? Get off of me. - Your friends visited last night. - What! Oh, it's a run fair committee. - Who are these guys? - There're so punctual! - So apparently, we're challenged a local run fair all drunk last night to an all out battle to the death. - We got drunk. - We wrote a note to some people I knew, who run a very successful Renaissance fair. And we took it over there and these people are scary. Oh, no. What are we gonna do? - Some people are a little downtrodden by it and they're thinking we're just gonna die. - What are we gonna do? - I don't know. I think we can really pull together and you know, defend our village. It's our home now, we're a real family, we're a real village. We can do this. All right maggots, get out of your bunks. We got war to do. - So this is what Sophie's been up to. We'll set up camp then over there. - Very good. - And be sure to put up the canopies first. - A Renaissance fairs are the best juice of a Saturday, that I can think of. It's a pretty good day out here. I'ma do most of the cooking for the Renaissance fair. - I've always been a fan of Renaissance since I was like nine. - But they're the only ones who don't give me credit for dressing up like a pirate. So it's kind of a reason why I'm here. - Sometimes there's women. - Almost all of the guests have arrived sir. One van has radioed in for help, I have sent a dispatch to South Dakota way to pull them out from the ditch. - Good. Do we have hamburgers and hot dogs? - Both hamburgers and hotdogs, sir. - What about napkins? - Napkins had been folded into the swan pattern. - Who authorized that Swan pattern? - That was Michael sir. - Good. And the table? - Side to side. We want to optimize elbow room and seating capacity. - Excellent. All seems up to par, thank you. - Almost all, sir. The villagers, we can't seem to find them. - Perhaps they're cowering in fear. - There's no way we gonna win. - Just get up, stand up, stand, everybody stand up, stand up, come on, rally around. There's no time for sitting, okay? Today we defend our village. Our enemy sits on top of that hill. They may have numbers, but this is just a hobby for them, okay? Look, they slept in their warm beds, drinking their lattes. They drove here in SUV's. I think those guys are drinking juicy juice right now. That's not period, this is not a game for us. This is our life. They may take event planning seriously, but we take everything way too seriously. They don't deserve to win this fight, who is with me? Yes! - Shh, they can hear you. Quiet, say it quietly. Yeah. Miles, ready with the thing. Like now. - Oh, I get it. Okay, yeah, I get you. - Jeez. Everybody else, the battle stations. Yeah. - They're launching melons at a sir. - Watermelons! Switch to non padded weapons. - Yes sir. - This is crazy, you are crazy. - Oh well, you guys both jerks. - Complete disregard for all safety and everything that is important. I do not get it! - Oh, well, you know, nobody asked you to come out here in the first place. - Look, nobody asked me, you asked us to come and we came. - You challenged us, a challenge that no self-respecting Renaissance fair could decline. - You're a sole loser, Sophie. You always have been. - Oh yeah, you guys are jerks. - You already said that. - Yeah well, because it's true. - Goodbye, Sophie. Good luck with all of that. - Well, good luck with being a jerk. - So, I know we lost pretty badly out there, but the good news is nobody's pressing charges. Look, it's pretty clear that we all want some changes around here. - Yeah, more military leadership that this, doesn't happen to us again. - Absolutely, we almost got killed today. - You really could have had some more spell casters as well. - I don't think everybody was pulling their weight. - I know for a fact, I wasn't the most useless person here. - We should have taken prisoners, so we could have gathered information on them before we fought them. - No, no, no, guys look, we lost a battle, it's okay. - It's okay that we lost! - Honestly it is, - This is your fault. It was your idea, and it might not matter to you, but I have a relationship outside of this with them. I know them prior and now they think that I am crazier than I was before. So, thank you. - How can you say it's okay that we lost. We didn't even wanna do this, this morning. - But then, you made that speech. - You gave us a speech, how are we going to say no to that? - Hey, hey, hey. I am declaring martial law. - What, you can't just do that! - I just did that? - We should take him to the stocks. - Well, we should take him to the stocks. - Really, no, no, no, guys, no, this is Middle vale. Okay, I built this place. You can't just take me to some stocks. Okay, fine. Let's go to the stocks everybody. Really guys, really like we even have a stock. This is insane, I didn't know, we actually had stocks. - You're right, I think it's time that we made some new laws for the town here. Middlevale ones. How do all of you feel about the death penalty? Yeah. - What! - Good. - Or deal by water. Yeah. - Fires? Yeah. - Combat? All that sounds good? Yeah. - Chinese water torture? Yeah, absolutely, good. - What is happening? What's actually happening right now. - So can we throw these tomatoes at him now or what? - Through the what? - Yeah, you can throw the tomatoes. - Throw the what, throw the what at what? What are they doing? Please don't? - One, - Don't please, please don't, please. - Two. I don't want this to happen. - Three. - I don't want, my neck, my face jeez. - Good early morning, fellow citizens. It is time for our mandatory sword trading for the day. - Let me just seal on this. - What is it? - It's the law that we talked about, the people aren't allowed to go outside without the buddy. It's the buddy, the buddy system. - You are all part of Middlevale's army now. We are only as strong as our weakest link. This is a form Miles wanted you to sign. It's something about an internship. - Okay, good. - You might even read it. - Next. - You can go forward, - You can go left, you can go right. Good, everybody try. - Hold on, I got this one. Step, spin kick. - You wanted us to start building new defenses and well we need more workers. - Have everybody stop what they're doing now, and work on defenses. - Okay right, but we only have like two hammers. - So have the blacksmith build hammers. Hey. - No, but you're beating half the kick. - A, b, a. - You just said everyone needs to be working on defenses. - Have all of them work together on hammers and when it's done, they build the fences together quickly. And then after that, they do everything. You are looking at a couple people like this and going left and right while it's over your head and you can do that up here too. Now we go to position b, - I took a look at the complaint box this morning. - How many are there? - There's like 50. I don't even know where we got all this paper. - Hi. My name is Dennis. I'm a fan of the middle ages. So I bought a lot of land. This is what I do now. I just live here. - Hey! - Did you get the message? - Yeah. Did you get the message? - I wouldn't be here if I didn't. - Do you know who wrote it? - I have no idea. It's kinda cool. - It's really cool. - Lyric. - Hello gentlemen. - Did you get the message? - No. - Oh, ah, well, ah. Nothing's going on here. Actually, I use probably go, - I wrote to the message. - Like you, you wrote, you actually wrote the message? - Yeah, we kinda hoping that it, you know? - I organize this, I brought you here, I wrote the message. Why is it so hard for you to understand? I wrote it. - Yeah, It's cool, do your thing. We're into it, we're still into it. - Fine. For far too long, we've been treated like scum. Those tyrants, the so called Nobles in the village, they treat us like dirt. They don't care about us. And now they put Trevor in charge. I mean, Trevor! - Seriously, I should be in charge. - I wanted to be the Knight in the first place. - Sophie, she's turning her claws into the ruling of Middlevale. She is such a leach and her food is so bad and she's so mean. - Ben, like I thought he was gonna be cool. He came into town like, oh, I'm a pizza delivery, boy. - You know who I don't like, Jerry! He's always stealing my customers. - Aw, I'm not really comfortable if we lumped Jerry in as an enemy. - He's not all there, you know? - Yeah, but... - So, I ask you now, are you with me? Yeah, yeah, - Why not! - I think so, sure, understood. - Are you with me? - Yes, we said we were. Didn't we just say that? - Yes, of course. - Jesus Christ, when Dennis gave a stupid battle speech, he was like, whispering it and you guys gave him a thousand percent energy. So I ask you again, are you with me, you rebel scum? Yeah, rebels. - We cut down our enemies. - We punch them in the eye. - We will rule this earth. Our enemies will whip before us, and we will take back Middlevale and we will rule it with a tender hand, a loving hand, but hand of justice. Yeah. Rebels, rebels, rebels, rebels. - Well, you know, my hours are up. So successfully completed my independent study, which you know, I think it's a good thing. I think that this was a good experience. It's good timing, things are getting weird, hey Dennis. - Hey, I'm gonna take off, my hours are up. Thank you for this opportunity. It's been, I see you around. - Water. - Anyway, see you. - So I found a sack of mail in Dennis's house. - Who's? - Well, I mean everyone's really, we've got some for Louis, we've got some for Jenna, your mom sent you a Christmas card. That's not to me, either. That one there, that one's for you too. I'm not seeing anything for me in here, that's a bit disappointing. That's Peter. Still not me. There's a Chinese menu in here, and take out the entire time. What, what is it? - It's my aunt Shelby. - Yeah, my great aunt Shelby! - Who's great aunt Shelby? - My grandma's sister. - But why are we talking about great aunt Shelby? - She died! - Oh! - Trevor, Trevor, - Oh Ben, we went over this. - What am I supposed to tell people? - Don't tell them anything. - I can't just not tell them about aunt Shelby. - Whatever you do, don't mention aunt Shelby. Make up a lie. This is your town to protect now, Ben. - What is that? - You're gonna be a hood, but this took me literally six and a half hours to make and then I got distracted. I have to go Ben. - Okay. What do I want? I don't know. I guess it was just always Trevor's thing to be the glory seeking bad-ass night, you know. He was the guy that wanted to protect people. I don't wanna disappoint him though, I wanna live up to his faith in me. I just, thank you all for coming. I have a couple of announcements. - Where is good sir Trevor? - Oh, he's not here at the moment. - Well, where is he? - Mm? - Where is he? - You guys have a lot of questions today. He left for a neighboring village to visit his great aunt Sheesh, who is dead. Damn, I'm a horrible liar. - He left for a neighboring village to visit his great aunt who is dead? - Yep. - Did he leave Ben? - Nope. - If Trevor's gone, can I be let out of the stocks, please. - How could Trevor just leave, I thought he was supposed to be our leader? - Well, in his absence, he left me in charge. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down there. You're just not quite the leader type. And we really need somebody who knows what they're doing. - Yeah, like someone who was experienced leading the village, leading this village, someone who's already done that. That'd be cool to put them back in charge and get them out of stocks. - Yeah, I think we need a new Knight since Trevor's not here. - Right, and I got this chain mail from Trevor and I... - Well, then Ben should be the Knight, make sense. - If martial law is still a thing, - Yeah, could you martial law me out of the stocks, that would be really awesome. - What kind of a leader was Trevor that he just abandoned us. Let's not think about - Hello, everyone. I thorn glove the purple, have thought long and hard. And I have decided that I will be the leader of this town. - And Jerry, is this really what you want? I mean the last guy, do you see what happened to him? - It's not a fun job, Jerry. - Yes, yes. I have been traveling down this path for many a year and it's all leading up to this point where I can teach all of you, what I have learned over my many years of studying. - No, no, Jerry, we're not gonna make him the leader of the village, right people? - Dennis, villainy is not your best attribute. I think you should be in there for 20 twinkles of the fairies wings. - What the is that? - 20 twinkles. 20 twinkles. - Is that a measurement of time? What is that? - I guess Jerry is in charge now. - Sophie, Sophie. So, anybody? Come on Jerry, I'm sorry about everything I said. Come on, just come back Jerry. Come on Jerry, Jerry. - Hello and welcome to the very first Middlevale, which is in wizard, collaborative dance competition. Just kidding, just kidding. Not a dance competition, it's a magic lesson. - Here we go, here we go. - Oh, yes. Good job, all right. The number one thing about magic is to have fun. We'll be doing a group spell link to each other somehow. So I need you to twist and turn. - Got to kind of cultivate it from the woods around me. Repeat after me, okay? ♪ I see a tree flash, flash ♪ - We have some news. We are going to be having a potluck later today. Here we go. - Here we go. - Here we go. - Here we go. - Magic. - Hey guys, sorry I'm late. - Oh, Jesus, shut up, where you followed? - No, there's like six people in town. I don't think I was followed. - Quite down, Peter. - Okay. - Just sit down. You were saying, right now is the perfect time to strike. - I agree, when we haven't really been doing anything, we just keep having these meetings, meetings. - Meetings are important. - Sure, maybe. One or two meetings, but we can't just keep having consecutive meetings. We gotta get out there and act, you know, steal from the rich, give to the poor. - What poor? Everybody in the village is equally poor. - No Louis is right. We should be doing that. And I know the perfect person at dawn, steel from the village. Meet me in the woods, then I'll show you. - Wait, where in the woods? The woods is a big place. - Are we meeting here? Are we meeting over there? - We gonna meet here, and then I will take you over there. Is that easy enough? - I'm gonna go with her, I think. - Oh, okay. That's cool. - Cool. - Jenna wait. - Hello Dennis. I brought you some water. - Give it here. - Okay, here we go. I got it, don't worry. - No, Jared. No, no, no, no, no. Don't pull up the wand. Just go to Sophie's and get me some water. - Conjure the water, back into the bowl. - No you can't. - Jerry no, just go down to Sophie's and get me more water. Jerry, what are you doing? - I'm conjuring the water out of the ground. - Jerry, Jerry, I am sick, sun burnt, dehydrated and tired of your. - Oh, okay. I have a few spells. - No you don't. No, no. Jerry, you can't, you don't have any spells. No, you don't spells don't exist. Magic doesn't exist. You're not a wizard, Jerry. You are not a wizard. Magic is not real. There weren't wizards in medieval times and aren't wizards now. - What about the sorcerers and the dragon? - Those are stories. They are, make believe stories. Has any of your spells even worked? Have you ever even seen anything magical happened before? No, cause you're not a wizard. Fine, if you can do it, do it now. Conjure the water back into the bowl right now. - All right. All right. - The water is not back in the bowl Jerry. You are killing me, literally with this. - Magic, holy magic. - Jerry open your eyes. Jerry, look at the bowl. There's no more water in the bowl. Go get me some water. - Where's your wizard robe? - I burnt it. Just wanna go home. - You see him? - This is Odd. - Yeah, damn old Odd. - He's the poorest of the poor, the lowest of the low. Look at him. He's perfect. - I wanna help Odd. - Yeah, this really sucks, Jenna. - No, no, no, this is what we do. We rebels, we steal from the rich and give to the poor. We have to do this. - I guess it would be better than just throwing this stuff all away. - Okay, but we're sneaking, right? I don't want Odd to know that we're helping him. - Oh, absolutely. The true mark of a great hero, is the air of mystery. - In the air of humbleness. - Humility I think. - Humility? - Humility. - Humility. - I'm convinced what? - Right, he's gone. - What are you doing? - Let's give his home, a renovation. - I don't think it's a good idea. - We can fix it, we can fix it. - Okay, okay. - I don't think so. - We got this, we got this. This way. We build a new shelter, yeah? - We fix it, we can fix it. - Where did this go? - I don't know, who is this? - I'm pushing from the bottom, is it going up? We put, he won't notice. - Yeah. - Like this? - Yeah. - Well that was the ceiling. - I've got lots to fix. I've got lots to fix. - Guys okay, I hope no more fixing. We can't fix this. - I think we're almost there! - We gotta go you guys, we gotta go. Let's just leave it. - Well, I suppose it was only a matter of time before they found me and destroyed my hut. This time to mock me, brought a crate of supplies, some food, farm fresh vegetables, baked bread, jam. Just doesn't. It's totally unbefitting the common man. I will stay resolute. Because I'm strong. - Go. Go away. - Sophie, Sophie is that you? - Yeah. - You gonna let me out of the stocks? - Oh yeah. - Oh yes, thank you so much. Goodbye and get through it. Let's do it. - Well, I have to call town meeting. Everybody come here. - What news innkeeper? - Well, Jerry has decided to step down and has named me successor. - Is that true, wizard? - It is, it is. And my first decree is to release Dennis. - Get it, lets do it. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Who do I find? The master thief. - No one cares. - Yeah, it's Odd. I found him, with the food. I found him with the food. - Ah, makes so much sense. - No, no, no, no, no, I didn't steal those. I found them, they were by my camp. - Somebody stole it and put it by your hut and then you decided to eat it all by yourself. - I was hungry. - Yeah, that is enough of a confession for me, so throw him in the stocks, okay. - What about Dennis? - Oh shoot. - I am so excited. Here's what I'm gonna do, I'll roll into town. I'm gonna rent a donkey. I'll just do whatever it takes to beginning a donkey for like a day. I'm gonna go, all on horseback and I'm gonna get some ice cream, with a double scoop, pistachio on the bottom, strawberry on the top. It's a sugar cone. I rub it on my belly and then the birds come. They start leaking it up. But I got to chainsaw. I chain saw their heads off of my belly. They all die. And then I eat them. I eat the birds raw for the past two months. I've been having this dream where I do exactly that. I'm gonna pee somewhere. I'm gonna do that. - Two good deeds in my first day of being in charge and things were looking up for Middlevale. - Oh my God! - Come on, Sophie. You can't keep the food yourself forever. - So, what's the plan here, exactly? - Well it was planned, lock ourselves in the end. The food, eat all of them. Quite frankly, I think that's, pretty good plan. - Yes Sophie, come out and face your justice. - Never! - She's not coming out. I think we should smoke her out. - I don't think that will be necessary. Louis, you sneak around and break in through a window. - Come back, I'm trying to help you. - You only make things worse. - He's so good, he's too fast! - Damn old Odd wants to stay in the stocks, I guess? - Boys, break down that door. - That's what I'm doing. - Use the log. - Fine. - Oh God. - Blueberries. - Will we really stay in here, you know, forever? - Don't retire, this place is dirty as a... - Oh, oh, okay, I got it, I got, I got, No, hey. - Your reign of terror ends now Sophie. - Please? - Or you could do any better, you won't even last five minutes. - No, I will lead this town into a place of glory where people can live with integrity, where they can follow their dreams. Witch, witch, witch, witch, witch. - You filthy traitors. - Look at whose talking! Everybody knows I was really the leader anyway. - No, I was the leader. - I was clearly the leader. - You were clearly a witch. - Yeah, Witch, witch, witch, witch, witch, witch, witch. - Fine, doesn't matter what you do to me? I have nothing. I'm an orphan. You turned me away. And I walked the world alone. I raised a rebellion and I burned your crown. - Okay, well. Who's in favor of burning the witch? - Ah, no, no, no. We're not actually burning anything. - Yeah, I'm good with just chanting witch for a while, that's it. - Let's put her in the stocks. - Go ahead. Burn me? I' am lyric, daughter of the Phoenix. I will rise from the ashes and devour you all, burn me? Burn me. - Okay. Oh, You actually gonna burn me to death! You trying to burn me to a steak. Trying to burn me, you're awful. You're all awful people. - All right, all right, calm down. And I call this town meeting to order. - Dennis, you're not in charge anymore, you can't call town meetings to order. - Yes I can, I can call anything to order. You had your shot at being in charge, you missed it. I'm in charge now. You can call town meetings sort of when you're in charge. - Ah, fine. I hereby call this town meeting toward order. - Except, you're not in charge either. - Yeah, nobody is in charge, okay? - I'm the sheriff. - I am the sheriff. - You were demoted. - I was not demoted - Oh my God, I am so fed up with you people. - I was running a black market. - Yeah, we all know. - What! When was this happening! - Okay, everybody knew except for Dennis. - Yeah, but the point is, that's the only reason anybody even talked to me. - Well, maybe you should try sitting behind the hot ass forge every single day, pretending to make swords. - Cause that's what I'm doing. I don't know how to make swords. Sorry guys! - But I would have been a great Knight! A better Knight than Trevor ever was. A better Knight that you would know Trevor, he was perfect! - Yeah! - Yeah! - Where's Trevor now, huh? He's not here, is he? - I'm not a wizard. My mom's coming to pick me up and I don't fit in anymore. - Yeah, that's probably for the best. - Shut up, Odd. You're stupid and dumb and you're just a big, stupid, dumb, stupid, dumb old Odd. - I am sick and tired of being called dumb. I am sick and tired of being called Odd. Oh, look at me. I've got boobs. I have character traits. Oh, look at me, I'm a Knight with a sword. Oh, look at all of us. We found out Odd's house that he spent six hours building. Let's tear it apart. Let's pee on it. You know what? I'm gonna destroy your houses. Lets' just start with this inn. Let's start with this inn. - Odd, stop destroying my inn. - Ha ha ha, so it's your inn, is it? - Oh yah, it is. - Well, it's my village. - Oh, your village? - Yeah. - I do all the work. - And look, where that got us. - No, Dennis, put the torch down. - I'm not gonna put it down Sophie. I'm not putting this torch down. - Dennis, stop. Put that thing away, man. - Dennis. - Oh my God. - Dennis, Dennis are you... - I feel terrible. - Dennis, Dennis, wake up. - Hey, alright, hang on. - Peter do something. - What do we do? - Get his fingers, you're okay, you're okay. - We need to go to a hospital. - Come on, come on. - Come on, we'll take my car. Just get in my car. - You gonna go out on a limb and guess that these are your friends. - Yeah. - Okay, he's gonna be fine. We reattached his fingers, no problem. We see a lot of larping injuries, hands, feet, ears. We're surprised how many parts you can cut off. - Still standing, still here. You know, it's I never would have thought after all these nights of sleeping alone in this end that people were actually gonna show up, you know. People weirder than me were actually gonna show up and make this place happen. - We made the dumbest, coolest, worst, best thing, ever. We fought, it was cold, it was dark, it was dirty. I was put in the stocks. I had my fingers cut off, but also I got put in the stocks. And I got my fingers cut off by a sword, and we had this giant revolt. We had like three revolts. I mean, you cannot get more medieval than that. It was so much more than I could have ever hoped for. - I love it, I love it. - It was right over there. - Yes. - And then points right towards my camp in the back. - It was so cool, despite every terrible thing that happened, it was so awesome. - And then I like took off my, I took out my sling, and then like, launched the arrow. Didn't really go to target. Are you even thinking good? - To be fair, I said I was finished and then he kept hitting me. - Yeah, its true. - I don't think that's fair. - It's so weird, how sometimes your dumbest ideas are the most supported by people around you. It's definitely why Middlevale was for me. And it's gone now, and I'm not too sad about it, because we can kind of move on. We're just here to fulfill one kooky crazy dream that turned out to be better than any of us could have expected. - So, what now?
