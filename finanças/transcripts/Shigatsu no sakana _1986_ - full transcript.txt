A Joint Production of Joy Pack Film, AMUSE Cinema City, PSC, Office Intenzio, Nippon Columbia, and Alfa Records You can't give up now. But... My hand... Don't say that! Maybe you can't hold your trumpet. But you've still got your songs. You've still got thousands, no, tens of thousands of fans supporting you. And...you've still got me. Cut! Cut! Cut! Sorry. You okay? Sorry. That's an outtake. Let's do it again. - I'm really sorry. - It's okay. We'll keep going until we get it. Sorry about that! Come on, Shirei-kun! What's his problem? Sorry, Director. He caught a bit of a cold yesterday. Blow. Changing rolls. That's enough. Take five, Fujiko-chan. Alright. How's the food coming along? About 30 more minutes. Looks like you're having fun. What do you mean by that? Playing around in outtakes won't get you any compliments from me. Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no, no. You're not jealous of the kid, are you? It's shameful. Just like the gossip about you in rags like Bishō. That was done by the agency's PR department. It was all made up. You know how it is. - You're an entertainer too. - Now hold on. You understand, don't you? I'm not an entertainer. I'm an artist. And seriously, Bishō? She'll be in Heibon, Punch, Post, and Gendai next week. Ridiculous. Don't you have any dignity? Aki-san, we need to fix the lighting! Come take a seat! Yes, sir. Poor Aki-san. Why would you say that, dear? Just the other day, you said you were going to clean up, then you barged into Aki-san's room and took down her curtains. I was just helping out. Aki-san deserves her privacy. You don't understand a woman's feelings at all, do you? That's your only flaw. Quit your bitching, Nemoto-chan! I don't mind you dropping by, but leave the lovers' quarrel at the door. Fujiko-chan, by the way... Hey, who is that guy? - Fujiko Kinugasa's husband. - Oh? - A director named Shōhei Nemoto. - Oh, the Dawn Expresso guy. - Express. - Ah, right. An extraordinary debut at the age of 23 and a marriage to the leading lady. - He was so cool back then. - Definitely. "Classic Director and Leading Lady Romance." The press were all over it. Oh yeah, that's right. He won a New Directors award from the Directors Guild too. Yeah, but even with the cinephile cred it bombed at the box-office. The only time that had ever happened in Fujiko Kinugasa's career. Seven years later and he hasn't shot anything since. Ah, so even the film world has useless employees. They say he just lives off his star wife now. Too bad that'll never be us. It's not like we're going anywhere. You're right about that. And now even the great Fujiko-san is doing idol movies. Let's go, everyone! - We're ready, Director. - Okay. Alright, let's roll! Let's go. You're bothering me, dear. Get off the set. Start the rain! Scene 128, Take 3! - Nemoto the director, right? - That's me. I'm not quite ready to make an announcement yet. - An announcement... So you're finally... - No, still working on that. - That? You mean your divorce? - Divorce? I'm talking about my next movie. Who cares about that? What do you have to say about the affair between your wife, Fujiko Kinugasa, and the up-and-coming singer, Masaaki Shirei? The two of them were spotted leaving a hotel together. What do you have to say as her husband? - Don't be absurd. - You've been married seven years. Just like Wyler's Seventh Year Affair. That's Wilder. Billy Wilder's movie from 1955, The Seven Year Itch. - It starred Marilyn Monroe and— - Jack Lemmon! - Tom Ewell. - Oh, Ewell, Ewell... Wait! Come on, just a quick comment! Cut! Cut! Come on, Nemoto-chan! We're filming... ...The Seventh Year Affair.

It's not just that. I'm always having to set you straight as your elder. That's not gonna get you in Bishō. Shōhei! Sensei! You received a fan letter in English! In English? Oh, this must be a fan of my Japanese-American production, Shadow Shōgun. You've finally become an international star. Dear, could you read this for me? Please. I'm busy right now. - Come on... - I'm cooking. What's this? Monsieur Shōhei Nemoto. This is mine. And it's in French, not English. It's not for you. Oh... So, who's it from? Hmm... Pa - na - po - ra Handa. Oh, it's from Chief Panapora. Who's that? Chief Panapona...whatever. It's Panapora! He's from the Rotonga Islands where I went to film that commercial five years ago. Oh, right! Shōhei Nemoto's mythical commercial. It was only shelved because the South Seas didn't suit my style. But anyway, he was the coordinator while I was on location. He's a second-generation Japanese and the chief of Aranila Island. I told you we hit it off. If he's Japanese, then why can't he write in Japanese? He speaks it well, but I guess he has trouble with writing. So? What does this chief want? Let's see... Shōhei, comment allez-vous? Oh là là! What is it? Oh, in France you just say oh là là at times like this. What does that have to do with anything? Well, Chief Panopora's coming to Japan. He says he's arriving on Friday, March 31st. He'll be staying at the Pacific Hotel that night, but he'll be visiting on Saturday. What do I have on Saturday? April 1st is April Fools' Day. Wait, that's our anniversary. Nice, we'll throw a welcoming party. For the chief? Of course. He's a great chief of 5,000 people after all. 5,000 people are coming? One person. Just the chief. I'm gonna make something that'll blow him away. I'll have to put in some special orders at Meidi-Ya. He really did that much for you? Of course he did. He gave me the VIP treatment. That wooden mask, the water buffalo horns, and the mounted sea turtle were all gifts. Why don't the two of us have a nice, long talk instead, dear? Over one of your delicious dinners. I can't do that. Friendships between men really need to be treasured. And I don't understand women's feelings anyway, right? Besides, we might end up talking business. Business? Yeah, maybe we'll collaborate on a movie or something. He's a wealthy man, you know. I might be making my first film in a long time. I've gotta come up with a story. I'll get Fujisawa to write it. He's been stuck writing awful TV scripts. This should get him fired up again. The South Seas again, huh? Just like the mythical commercial. What are you talking about?! My films are the height of artistic expression! To compare them to some cheap commercial... Stop laughing! How many times do I have to tell you? Don't interrupt me while I'm cooking. My French cuisine is art. - Aki-san, let's go out to eat. - Yes, let's. Wait, what kind of food? We'll have Japanese food tonight. - At Hōmasa? - That's right. - You better eat something other than nattō. - Oh? What's wrong with nattō? It doesn't suit you. Nattō is a plant-based protein that's good for both your body and your mind! Are you kidding me? If I ate nothing but that rotten stuff, my brain would rot just like yours. Speaking of rotten food, what about all that cheese you eat? - Right. - Cheese is a fermented product! It's not rotten at all! - Whatever. Let's go, Aki-san. Come on. - Yes. "You've still got thousands, no, tens of thousands of fans supporting you." "And...you've still got me." Man, I'm hungry... Nora... Nora! Oh là là! Hello. Hello, Fujisawa-kun, please. No, the screenwriter, Fujio Fujisawa-kun. Hey, Fujisawa? This is Nemoto. Yeah, I'm fine, but listen. I've got something really important to talk about. Ah, I'll call you back tomorrow. Right, yeah. Yeah. Bye. - Who was that? - I just gave Fujisawa a call. I talked to him about the script. He's really excited. So am I! I gave the president of the agency a call from Hōmasa. He said a welcoming party for the chief would be good publicity. So you can grace us with a display of your cooking ability. And we've got the wine that Nishimaru-san from my fan club gave us as a wedding present. - Oh, what was it... - Gevrey-Chambertin, right? - Yeah, that's right. Why don't we open it? - One bottle is 300,000 yen... If we don't open it at a time like this, then we never will. You're right. But what could I possibly make to go with it? Oh, and I'll have to find a dress to match. Will he be alright with a Western-style toilet? Yeah. - One of the bathroom tiles is chipped. - I already called the repairman. Well then, I'll be off to bed. - Good night to you both. - Night. Good night. You don't look so good, dear. Really? You ate that big beignet, didn't you? You'll wreck your stomach. Of course not. So you didn't eat anything? You must be starving. I'd offer to make you a little something, but... Don't worry about it. You go on to bed. Staying up late is bad for your looks. - You shouldn't stay up too late either. - I won't. Oh yeah, I'll be on The Wednesday Variety Show tomorrow with Shirei-kun. I won't be home for dinner. Oh là là! Oh là là! Oh, Fujiko-san, Fujiko-san... Oh là là! Man, I'm hungry... So what did you wanna talk about? Spit it out. I'm a busy guy. A movie. We're finally making another movie. The return of the dynamic duo behind Dawn Express. You can get back to writing movies. You won't have to write those same old TV scripts anymore. You kiddin' me? Look! Look at that table there. That's serious drama. I've got melodramas right here. I'm doing variety shows too. You never change, do ya? So tell me about this movie. Got a good story, don't ya? - You could barely get the words out on the phone. - Well... Actually, there's something I've gotta take care of first. I've got a big problem... Is that right? Man, never known you to be so timid. I'm in trouble. I've got a favor to ask. I'm backed into a corner here. For the sake of the dynamic duo, I need your help. Which one should I wear? How about something flashy for a South Seas man? Or maybe something Japanese to charm a Japanese man. Sensei, may we talk about the toilet? Excuse me? Don't you think someone from the islands would prefer a squat toilet? It's a French territory, isn't it? Indeed it is. Though for a Japanese person, I think squatting would be— He's the chief! Indeed he is. Which one shall we go with? Yes, which one... Let me get this straight. You're saying a sign of friendship on this island is to offer your wife for a night? That's right. So, that means... The chief offered you his wife, Nora, and the two of you got cozy one night? - I refused at first. - Really? But if I hadn't done it, I'd have upset the chief. And it's a headhunting tribe, so... Oh my god! You lady-killer, you! You maniac! Pervert! Pervert! I'd look so sexy in this... You didn't actually do anything with her? You serious? Which one shall we go with? You counted the stars? What does that mean? Well, you keep counting until you see a shooting star. Then you start over. - All night long? - Yeah. - With that woman? - Yeah. With Nora... There it is! Your platonic love worship has reared its ugly head again. Modern society is all about sex and violence now, not that old-fashioned stuff. How could you create anything in a world like this?! I bet that Nora was quite the tan beauty, wasn't she? What a waste... I couldn't tell the chief about it. I didn't want to upset him. Yeah, wouldn't want to do that... Thank you, Chief! Thank you, Nora! Our friendship is so strong! I'll return the favor one day! You'll have to visit Japan sometime! Au revoir, Chief! You didn't think that through at all, did you? Au revoir, South Seas! I was just so moved at the time. I got caught up in my feelings toward the South Seas. That's beautiful. You're an ambassador of international goodwill, huh? It's not funny. The chief's coming to my house on Saturday. So, you're saying Fujiko-san's going to be sleeping with the chief. Am I right? That's funny! A proper comedy! It's a tragedy. A Japanese tragedy. How does Fujiko-san feel about it? I can't tell Fujiko about any of this. - If they're not banging, then why not? - That makes it even more complicated. Why? You'd just be defending her honor. It's the spirit. Huh? You might not understand, but it's a matter of the spirit. I'd have to tell her about the beautiful memories I made with Nora that night. Plus things aren't great between us right now according to reporters. So what are you gonna do? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. You're a former Kido Award winning screenwriter. - I know you can plot me a way out of this. - Well, let's see... - It needs a happy ending. - Yep. - It's about a man protecting his wife's virtue. - Absolutely. - International goodwill must be maintained. - Of course, of course. Hmm... Okay. Alright, the safest way would be to keep the two of them from meeting. That's impossible. Leaving Fujiko out of the dinner party would be incredibly rude. I've got it. A stand-in. - A stand-in? - Yeah! You're confusing one of your dramas for reality. That's a ridiculous idea. Shut up! You're the dull one pretending to be an artist! Your image is down the drain! If we can't use the star, we'll use the stand-in! That's movie magic, idiot! It's easy for writers to come up with absurd ideas that only work in their heads. You think that would actually work on set? It's not gonna fool anyone. A writer is a lighter that only sparks a fire. The set's just your ashtray. You might fool your average TV viewer, but you won't get away with it on a film. No wonder Dawn Express flopped... It flopped 'cause a certain someone was playing at being an artist. Whatever, there's no point in fighting. This is a pretty common premise. Everyone's done it. It's lame. You should leave TV to the experts. Listen, the first thing you do is get your wife to visit her parents. You train the stand-in while she's gone. Then she spends the night with the chief. All wrapped up in three parts. That story works. - What about this stand-in? - What about her? She'll be dealing with a chief. A VIP. A very important person. - I can't set him up with just any old girl. - Listen, leave the casting to me. I know an up-and-comer from a certain theatre group. She's got the looks and no inhibitions. Give her the details and she'll be on board. Bring a girl like that to my house? She's a good kid. Seems she got mixed up with some guy once. Fell head over heels for him. Then he dumped her. At that moment, she lost that so-called "spirit" of yours. She's perfect for this role. How do I get Fujiko to visit her parents? Oh, come on! Just say the chief is crazy and dangerous. Say he might attack her or something and send her running off home. It's only for a night. Nice script, ain't it? Speaking of that, Kinugasa-san... People are asking about your relationship with Shirei-kun. What can you tell us about that? Oh, I'm a married woman. Shirei-kun's like a little brother to me. For me, she's more of a mentor than a sister. She's taught me about so many things. Aren't you cute... Well, aren't we all jealous? And with that, we have a scene from their new movie, "The Lullaby That Caused a Storm". Let's take a look. Good grief! "April Fool" is right! Horrible, just horrible. A crazy chief that cuts off heads and puts them in the soup! It's awful! - Lord have mercy... - You be safe. Call me if anything happens. I will. Let's get out of here! Goodbye. Cut! Fujisawa? Scene One complete. Nice! Scene Two, action! Hey, Mari? Yeah, it's about what we discussed yesterday. We're good to go. Counting on you. Huh? Yeah, don't worry about it. See ya. Okay... I'll Never Fall in Love Again. Alright, break a leg, Mari. Thank you. Welcome! Next, please. Welcome. Ouch... Sorry. Hey, you're the... Oh, it's you... Excuse me! Here you go! Thanks! What a mess... Produce. Fresh fish. Here you go. Do you live nearby? Yeah, just up ahead. I'm going that way too. - I'll help you carry it. - Oh, thanks. - You off today? - Yep. It's just part-time. So where are you headed? To my real job. Real job? You could say that. What? Well, I shouldn't be surprised that I'm walking with you like this on April Fools' Day. Oh yeah, you were telling me that April Fools' story the other day. Yeah, about the poisson d'avril. That's it! Let me hear the rest. Let's see... Where did we leave off? Hmm, we got to the part about fish-shaped chocolate being handed out on April 1st. Oh, right. I'll keep it short. A long time ago, the new year began on April 1st. On that day the people would play little jokes on each other, known as poisson d'avril. That was how April Fools' Day started. Eventually, a custom developed where people would exchange chocolate fish. Sometimes there would be love letters hidden inside. Wow! Can you guess what the April Fish is? No, what is it? A mackerel. - A mackerel? - Yep. It's said that mackerel eat anything in April, so fishermen can easily catch the stupid fish. Mackerel, or maquereau, has another meaning too. It can also be a pimp. A pimp? Yeah, in the spring, a pimp would be looking for new girls. A pimp, huh? Let's see, is this... - Hm? - Hold on a sec. Oh, I need to go this way. You too? Really? You live this way? Yep. What are these? Cerises noires. Black cherries. Really? Are you putting them in a dessert? Yes, but I'm making a dessert with a special meaning. Oh, this is my place. Oh, okay. Here's your bag back. Got it? - Yep, I've got it. - See ya! Thanks. Find your place? It's a little further, I think. See ya! See ya! "See ya!" Don't step over people! Here we go. Scene Two, the stand-in makes her entrance. - Hi, welco— - Ah! I-It's you... Wait, so you're Shōhei Nemoto, the director? And you're the girl Fujisawa sent? That's right. I'm Mari Marimura from the Attic theatre group. Wow! Mind if I come in? Oh, please do. Could you close the door? Sure. Now this is a real April Fools' Day. Hello. Wow, nice place! So what did Fujisawa-kun tell you? He just told me to come here for an acting test. A test... I see... I can't believe you're Shōhei Nemoto. Oh yeah, that means you're Fujiko Kinugasa's husband. How old are you? 19...is what I tell people, but I'm actually 21. Have you done it before? With a guy? No... I mean acting. Oh no, you wouldn't ask a girl over 20 if she'd been with a guy, would you? No... Of course not. I wouldn't ask that even if you weren't... Everyone in my theatre group lives together. Our banner is the overthrow of monogamy. So, you'll...do it with anyone? Have sex? Yeah, uh... Sex. Maybe... Garoize. - That's Gauloises. - Ah, gotcha. So, Mari-chan... Hm? So are you and Fujisawa-kun... Fujisawa-san is.... ...my doctor. Your doctor? He told me all about his director friend who really needs some help with his acting research. So I came here for you to put me to the test. Y-You know... I've also been having doubts about monogamy lately... What happened? Well, uh... People these days need sexual liberation. Being tied down to one person forever is unnatural. You're right. That whole "enduring love" thing is nonsense. So why did you decide to get married? It was rash, and I regret it. I think you and I are going to get along. You're hired. So I passed. How much does the job pay? - 50,000 yen. - Wow! Actually, for you, 100,000 for the night. The night? You want me to stay over? That's with overtime pay. So what role am I playing? You're playing the lady of the house. My wife. I'm an actress. - I'm not some call girl! - Wait a sec! You've got the wrong idea! I really need your help! Let me explain. A guest from another country is coming tonight. Another country? Yeah, an extremely important guest. My wife's filming on location, so she can't make it. Oh, I get it. You want me to be the hostess. Right, I need someone to be the hostess. You'll be playing the role of my wife. Interesting... All your dialogue will be improv. You'll drink and dance with him. Also... - I can't do it. - Huh? My English is terrible. Don't worry about that. He's actually a second-generation Japanese. He speaks Japanese just fine. Is he young? No, but he's a great man. We share the same philosophy and appreciation for the arts. He's also opposed to monogamy. So maybe I'd even offer my beloved wife to make him feel welcome. So progressive! Progressive... Yeah... He from Sweden or something? No, the South Seas. The South Seas! Wow, he's so manly! So you'll do it? - There's something weird about this. - What do you mean? If you're opposed to monogamy, then why's it a problem if your wife is gone? There are certain customs I have to follow. A wife's a part of those? That's right. An ornament for parties and special occasions. Put these on. Oh, cute! - Hey... - Hm? You can say no if you want. It sounds fun! And it's a 100,000 yen gig. I'm totally in! Okay then... Scene Three, action! Scene Three? Yeah, the cooking scene. This is the theme song. Wow! What are we making? Spaghetti? No, nothing so unrefined. We're making French cuisine. I made part of the main course yesterday, the terrine de poisson. It's in the fridge. - Got it? - Gotcha! What kind of answer is that? You're supposed to be my wife. Try, "Yes, dear." Gotcha! Yes, dear! Okay, put this on. What are you doing? Making clarified butter. It's used in a lot of French dishes. Wow, really? Yes, dear. That's right. We're going to make a few more things now. For the hors-d'œuvre, Bavarois à la tomate. For the main course, gigot d'agneau rôti. Suprêmes de cailles à la vigneronne aux framboises. And finally, soufflé aux oursins. We're making what now? - Come on... - Oh yeah. - What are those, dear? - That's right. Gigot d'agneau rôti. That's a roasted leg of lamb. Also known as lamb in a fragrant cloak. Wow, that's cool! Dear! Isn't it?! Sometimes I'll throw a fish on the grill Suprêmes de cailles à la vigneronne aux framboises. That's quail in a winemaker's style. Cute! So are you! Next we have the soufflé aux oursins. Sea urchin soufflé. Can't we just eat the sea urchin raw? No, we're not eating it raw. - Cooking is art. It's a creative activity. - Yes, dear. So, who's going to be cooking them? The two of us, of course. Who, me?! No way, Director. There it is again. You have to become my wife starting from deep inside. Deep inside? That's acting. It's Stanislavski's "Magic If." Even if all your secrets were revealed, you'd push through to the end as my wife. That's why we're rehearsing. Hmm... Gotcha, dear. What's that? - The wine I drink when I'm cooking. - Oh? Could you grab those glasses? Wow! Dear! Here. There we go. Can you taste the gravel? Huh? This wine is from Graves. - It's a very gravelly region in France. - Oh, that's interesting! I think it's more sad than anything. Can't you hear a burbling sound? Burble, burble? Try zooming out. You see a wide, dry riverbed full of gravel. The sun is shining. And the burbling goes on and on. Yeah... Yeah! Then, a single butterfly lands on one of the stones. Ah, that's me! It's so faint. But despite that, it's casting a distinct shadow. It won't be long before the butterfly disappears. You don't even notice it happening, but there's water in the once dry riverbed. The burbling goes on and on. Wow... Is it good? It's good. But... Now I'm kinda sad... Sad? I'm just acting. I'm not really sad or anything. I'm not the kind of person who cries. "Upon this soiled sorrow..." Chūya Nakahara. One of my favorite poets. You can do anything, can't you, Director? - From deep inside. - Yes, dear! You can do anything, can't you, dear? Excuse me. I grew up with a French restaurant next door. - "The young monk learns from his surroundings." - Wow, the director grew up as a monk. Dear! It's just a proverb. What can I help with, dear? Let's see... You can take about four stalks each from pots 2, 4, and 5. Huh? What are these? Those are herbs. Aromatic plants. Number 2 is thyme. Number 4 is chervil. Number 5 is rosemary. Can't you get these in a bottle? Yeah, but these are the real deal. So this is rosemary... You've seen that devilish old movie, Rosemary's Baby, right? No, I was just a kid then. What?! What about Messenger of Allah? Nope. What?! Kaiketsu Harimao? Nope! A long time ago, Europeans used rosemary as protection from witches. Superstitious people still keep it around their homes. Really? People would also feed it to sheep to keep them from being snatched up. What do I do with it? For that, you'll chop it up and put it in that bowl over there. This one? Yeah. Then take 30 grams of salt. A big tablespoon. Add it to the bowl and mix it well. Yes, dear. Now what? Now... You use this. What is it? It's for poking holes in the meat. - Poking holes in the meat, huh? - Yep. Next, we add the garlic. - Right, the garlic... - One more. Huh? What's wrong? Oh, it's nothing. Grab that butter for me, will you? Gotcha. Yes, dear. We put the garlic and herbs inside of the meat. Then we take the rest of the salt and rub it on the outside. And finally we take the butter and add it on top. Quail in a winemaker's style. So we have to do it in style. That's cruel! Cooking is cruel. It's like love in that way. Like love? You have to make sacrifices for the sake of love. It's the same for delicious food. Hmm... Done! Good! Could you grab the pot of butter from over there?

But you said this dessert has a special meaning, right? Right. So what is it, dear? Let's talk about how to cook it first. First you simmer the cherries in juice. Then you hold an orange peel over the pan and pour the kirsch. That's a cherry brandy. As you pour, you light it on fire to make the sauce. Then, while it's still hot, you serve it over ice cream. That sounds hard. The dessert's called cherries jubilee. It was made to celebrate a special anniversary. An auspicious dessert representing enduring love. - Here you are, dear. - Thank you. We make it every year for our wedding anniversary. Every year? Well, for the first four or five years. We've both been busy for the last few. Hmm... - Hey, dear? - Hm? When's our wedding anniversary? April 1st. What? That's today! Wow, that's funny! An anniversary on April Fools' Day... That's cool. - It sounds like a joke. - You're right. It does sound like a joke. Well, the two of us will celebrate it today. With cherries jubilee. That's right. We'll celebrate our enduring love. - Huh? - That was just a test. Right... Yes... You're so beautiful... That's right, come closer... Closer... She wants those. What? Give her some. But these are my favorite! They're Irma's favorite too. You're driving her crazy. Okay... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Here you go. Oh, thank god. - Who are you anyway? - Oh, I'm from Kobayashi Contracting. I'm here to fix the tile in the bathroom. Ah, I was expecting you. - Come on in. - Okay. Oh, uh... That's a sexy dog you got there... I'm sorry! Where's the bathroom? Fujiko, this is the bathroom guy. - Kobayashi Contracting here. - I'm Nemoto's wife. - The bathroom's by the front door. - Gotcha. - Fujiko, could you get the phone? - Yes! Be polite. Yes, dear. - It might be from the chief. From deep inside, okay? - Yes, dear! Chief? Hello? This is it. Yes, sir. Yes, this is the lady of the house. - That one right there. - Gotcha. Let's see here... - Hey, you've got a broken tile! - Yeah, I do... Oh yeah... Well, I'll just go ahead and do my business. What the hell are you talking about?! Nemoto's busy right now. That must be Fujisawa. I told you, I'm his wife. Well, from deep inside, have a nice day. What was that about? Wrong number, dear. Another one, huh? I get prank calls pretty often. That's the price of fame. But it's nothing to worry about, my dear wife. Aki-san! I'm back, I'm back! 40 yen is your change. Do you want a dress or a kimono? I don't wear kimonos. Alright, we'll go with a dress. How about this one? No? Okay... Oh, this one's pretty, dear. Ah, Fujiko had that made right after we got married. That's one of her absolute favorites. - I don't know about... - This one's perfect, dear. This one, huh... Whoa! - Can I borrow some underwear too? - Underwear too?! I can't wear that dress with this lingerie! That's how it is, huh? Yep. That's how it is, dear. Okay... Uh... I think her underwear's probably in that drawer. Well? Nope. Hey, this is perfect! - Perfect, huh? - What do you think? Yeah, perfect! You must be tired of seeing your wife naked. Right, dear? Yeah, maybe... Could you fasten me up, dear? Changing costumes during a play is hard work. Everyone in the theatre group just runs around buck naked backstage. Buck naked, huh? Come on, what's wrong? You'll catch a cold like that. Hurry and put on some clothes.

Ah! Monsieur Nemoto! Bonsoir! Oh, bonsoir! Bonsoir! Très belle! Très belle! How are you? - Monsieur Panopora. - Oui, madame... It's an honor to meet you. My husband's told me all about how you took care of him on your island. Our friendship is very strong, ya know? Ma femme. This is my wife. Très belle, très belle! Aren't you cute?! Très belle! Très belle! So cute! - Oh? - Hm? What's this? Oh, this is a shell you can only find on Aranila Island. This amour shell signifies the love between two people. Oh my, it's lovely. Shōhei, you have such a young wife. What a blessing. Come on in. Oh! Très bien, très bien! Beautiful, ya know? I've put my heart into this French cuisine. Please enjoy. Merci, merci. Madame, this souvenir is for you. Wow! Fujiko, open it, please. S'il vous plaît. Yay! F-Fujiko... - Merci beaucoup. - Oh, bon... S-So... How's your wife? Oh, Nora! She's fine, she's fine. - We have a son now. - What?! Don't worry, he looks just like me. C'est la vie, ya know? Huh? - That's life, ya know? C'est la vie, ya know? - Oui, oui, oui! Ah, right... Well, why don't we have a toast? Oh, champagne! This part's scary! Très bien! Très bien! Yes, c'est bien. Yes, très bien, très bien! Très bieeeeen! Oh! British style... How wonderful. Isn't it lovely? Très bieeeeen! Um... Let's... Let's celebrate our reunion. - À votre santé! - À votre santé! À votre santé! Bon, bon! This is Bavarois à la tomate. Bon! Bon! Très bon! Très bon, madame! Bon! Madame! Madame, madame! You look more delicious than this meal! Oh, you joker! - Fujiko, could you pass out the terrine plates? - Yes? Of course. Merci. Merci. - Here you are. - Merci. Your delicious-looking terrine... Merci. And your consommé. Terrine... Consommé. Fujiko... Fujiko! Madame, madame... - Your husband is calling you. - Y-Yes?! Dear... Could you turn off that light? - Yes, dear. - Yes, dear. Oh! Sexy beaucoup. Oh, très bien! - Très bien! - It's nothing... Wow! Fujiko... - Yes, dear? - Yes, dear? This sea urchin soufflé is soufflé aux oursins. I made a mousse from Yesso scallops and sea urchins direct from Sanriku. They're exquisite. You could call them my specialty. - Merci. - Ah, bon. - Here you are. - Oh, merci beaucoup. Oh, look at the cute little urchin! - Here's one for you, Chief. - Oh! Ah, the sea urchin's burning! - But my heart is what's really on fire! - You and your jokes! Ouch! Let me see, let me see... Mama's cute li'l finger is yummier than any sea urchin! Oh! - Shōhei! - Yes?! We're building a hotel on my island. - A hotel? - Yeah. A hotel, huh? Yeah, blue seas and blue skies. Lots of greenery, so no smog, ya know? I wanna go! What will the hotel be like? Oui, oui, oui... It's funded by myself and a Japanese company. That's called fifty-fifty in English. Fifty-fifty, I see! The hotel has eight floors. It has a yacht harbor, you can go surfing... We plan to build a cable car on the mountain too. A cable car? We'll get lots of those rich Japanese tourists to come. - Yeah, you will. - Young people love to travel, ya know? They'll come to go sightseeing. - They'll come to shop too. - That's great! - I'm sure it'll be a success! - Oui, oui, oui, oui! Aranila Island will be a modern paradise, right? That sounds great! A young person's island! An island of love! Ripe bananas and papayas! - A sea of handbags! - A sea of... A sea of handbags! Hey, slow down! Hey, slow down! Advertising is crucial, Chief! Why don't we make a great romance movie set on the island? Oui, oui, oui, oui. I'm thinking about it. Let's do it! You can count on me to make it! Our friendship is so strong! So, can you have as many wives as you want on your island, Chief? Maybe I could be number three. Oh, that's a joke. That's my wit. And now we have the gigot d'agneau rôti. The lamb in a fragrant cloak appears. Chief, I want to show you a sign of our friendship. This wine I have for you is a Gevrey-Chambertin from Burgundy. Well, let's open it. Wow, pretty! It's out... Huh... That's tasty, ya know! It's an honor to please you. That's tasty, ya know! - Tasty, tasty... - Your plates, please. - Plates, plates... - Here. Plates... Here ya go. Thank you. Tasty! Pour me some too. Bien sûr! Bien sûr! Another glass! Indeed! Indeed... Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui, oui, oui, oui... - Bien sûr! Bien sûr! Bien sûr! - More, more, more, more, more! That costs 300,000 yen a bot— Ah! Ah, bon. Pardon! Pardon! Pardon, pardon! Where'd you go?! Boo! Where'd you go?! Boo! Boo! Boo! - May I have your plates? - Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! Yeah! - Yeah! - Yeah! O raftsmen of Kiso Ontake-san of Kiso, what is it, hoi Ya know, I fought with the Japanese soldiers during the war. Wiping out the Americans and the British, ya know... The men in the jungle would sing that song and cry. Even the summer is cold, yoi yoi yoi Ha, yoi yoi yoi no, yoi yoi yoi Wow! I just want to eat ochazuke again, ya know? W-Well, uh... For this gigot d'agneau rôti, the lamb— F-Fujiko, please... - O raftsmen of Kiso - ...raftsmen of Kiso Yoohoo! Ontake-san of Kiso, what is it, hoi Hoi, hoi! Who is it? What are you doing here?! Someone's a bit pale. Did you run into some trouble? The trouble seems to be right here. The chief was just an excuse to bring a woman home, huh? - No, no! - Oh, I'm wrong, am I? I didn't! - Well, why don't I just have a look? - No, no, calm down. I am calm! As your wife, I'd just like to greet our guests! No, no, let's just slow down! Let me go! Come on, Fujiko. Let me explain... Shut up! Oh là là! Right? Oh! Well, excuse me! Hey, it's Fujiko Kinugasa! Hey, that's my dress! Weren't you supposed to be on location? It was you on the phone! On the phone? Don't you play dumb with me! Ah, let me introduce you. This is Shōhei's madame. Yes, dear. Oh, is that right? Well, I am the lady of the Nemoto house. Huh? Oh, I see. You must be Shōhei's mother. How rude! Get out of my house or I'll sue you for trespassing! Don't pay her any mind, Chief. - This lady's not right in the head. - She's playing a trick on you, Chief! A trick? Oh, non, non, non, non, non, non... I am Nemoto's wife! I'm his wife! From deep inside! You're the one who should get out! That's not going to happen! Chief, what this woman is saying is absolute nonsense! I'm the one who's married to Nemoto! Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui! You must be his second wife! Second wife? Non, non, non, non, non, non, non, non, non! Non! - I am his first wife! - My handbag! And just where is my husband? That's right... Why don't we hear it straight from his mouth?! Hey there! What? You're still here? - Oh, going out on the town? - Yeah, I guess I am... That's nice. Dear?! Dear?! Dear?! - Dear?! - Dear?! - Dear?! - Dear?! Dear?! - Dear?! - Dear?! Dear?! - Dear?! - Dear?! This is hell. It's the guillotine. - Yeah, this is the dream. - A bad one. Right! Dear! Dear! - God, even the chief's out there! - Oh, so that's the chief you mentioned. Yeah. - Come on out, dear! - Come on out, dear! Come on out, dear! Dear! Dear?! Dear, if you don't get out here right this minute... Oh god, she's about to get hysterical! Okay, I'm coming out! Hey there! À votre santé! Well, that sure was something. Why don't we put all those minor points of contention aside and have a nice, peaceful meal? How about some suprêmes de cailles? Let's sprinkle some pepper on these cute li'l vineyard birdies. - Dear... - Yes?! Please throw this homewrecker out of our house first. Are you talking about me?! - Who else would I be talking about? - This bitch is making me mad! - What did you say?! - Who are you calling a homewrecker?! Come on, both of you calm down! Whoa, hold on! - Take a look at this! - What is it? A charm against witches! Begone! You impudent... S-Shōhei, what the hell's going on?! - Oh, they're almost done. Aren't you? - Dear, which one of us is your real wife?! Both of them, both of them! Which one?! Yo! - Oh yeah, we can ask him! - Huh? - Which one of us is the wife here? - Excuse me, my throat's a little dry, ma'am. I'll just help myself to this. Gah, that costs 300,000 yen... Oh yeah, now this is a man's wine. Who is this person? - He's the bathroom guy. - Oh, I'm from Kobayashi Contracting. Hey there, granny. Granny?! - What did you call me?! - I've still got some work to do! Excuse me! Dear, clear this up right now! Chief, this is Fujiko Kinugasa-san, the famous Japanese movie star. Ah! - Très bien! - Oh, merci! Her most famous work is— - The Cute Girl Is a Liar! - Right, right. That's not what matters here! I understand. Uh, this is a difficult thing to discuss... Hey, you don't look so good. Are ya feeling sick? Yeah, maybe I am sick. What sickness did you have over the past six years we've lived together?! - And here come the tears! - What did you say?! I can explain this from an artist's perspective! Have some gigot d'agneau rôti with gelée de menthe, the mint jelly. Doesn't that sound good? Well, Fujiko-san? Huh? - Can't we work this out? - Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui... - I'm going back to the hotel! - Oh no, why would you do that? Looks like you've got some woman trouble, you lady-killer. I'll pass on that! But... Good night! C'est la vie, ya know? I am the head of the Nemoto house. Nope, I am! From deep inside. - Isn't that supposed to be me? - Oui, oui, oui, oui, oui... This was a lot of fun! - I'll head out with you! - But... Really? For sure, I'll take you to the disco in Roppongi! It's a wife's duty! - But... - Quit butting in! Hey now, hold your horses. Shōhei, is it okay if I take your younger wife out on a date? - That's... - It's super okay! Well, then let's get out of here! C'est la vie, ya know? How awful! Dear! You brought that woman into our bedroom! You're shameless! Oh, that's not mine! It's hers, isn't it?! What did you get up to with that woman?! - She just changed clothes. - Even her panties?! This is a misunderstanding. - She was just a stand-in playing your role. - Why would I need a stand-in?! - Let's slow down. I can explain everything. - Oh, I get it... You two were planning on taking this house for yourselves. Well, I won't allow it. I'm the one who paid for it all! What? Don't put it like that. Who is that woman?! How long have you been together?! - We're not together. - Liar! That won't work on me anymore! - She was just acting. - Acting?! How stupid do you think I am?! Fujiko, I was only thinking of you. There was an emergency and I— Get that dirty thing away from me! Ah! This is hers too... You don't understand. I was just procuring a partner for the chief. - Procuring? - That's right. So now you're a pimp?! A pimp?! Not in the least! I'm the recipient of a New Directors award from the Directors Guild of Japan. You're wrong. I was just returning the favor for the chief. Returning the favor? What favor? Are you saying he procured someone for you? Say, isn't Aki-san still passed out by the front door? Dear! - That's a wrap! - W-Welcome home! So how'd I do, Director? Where's the chief? Waiting in the car. Oh, okay. I came to pick up my money. Right, the money. Here you go. - What about the receipt? - I'll get that for you later. - Where at? - Check with Fujisawa. So the truth comes out! You're a prostitute, aren't you? Gimme a break! I'm an actress! This is my performance fee. Free love comes after. Asking for payment for a performance like that is laughable! You really are an amateur! Oh, wise words from the hammy queen of melodrama! What did you say?! I graduated with the 16th class of the Actors Training School. That's right. Sorry to burst your bubble, but the director begged me to do this! And so I admirably stepped into your role! - A "thank you" would be nice! - This is my fault. I'm sorry. Who cares if you're a star?! Could your head get any bigger?! Make this woman be quiet, dear! That's my dress! Take it off! Oh, non, non, non! It doesn't suit you, ya know? Shut up! Oh, the present from the chief. In your dreams! What's your problem? He brought that for me! Don't be stupid! It was for me! For you? I'm Nemoto's wife! I was your wife when he gave it to me, right? That's true. She was at that point. You're going along with this? The person who's legally married to him is me. And he regrets it. He said it was rash. Did you really say that?! It's just a figure of speech! - I've always thought highly of marriage, Fujiko! - How awful! Everyone's ganging up on me! - No we're not! - I've become a laughingstock! You won't be needing a stand-in. Please tell the chief. No stand-ins. No modesty patches. I shall become his partner. What are you talking about?! I shall be sacrificed for the sake of international goodwill! Thus, upon the passing of three days... ...upon the passing of three days, I shall imbibe poison... ...and die. Calm down, Fujiko! Hmph, what a worthless Cleopatra! You dare to insult Shakespeare? Who's worthy of my respect, then? That glorious martyr to love and theatre, Sumako Matsui-sensei. Oh, please don't go there... There's no need for that. The chief said he's not interested in middle-aged women. Once you hit 30 you're an old lady in the South Seas. That's retirement age. Are you saying I'm an old lady?! That I should retire?! Why do you think the director hired a nice, young girl like me to be the stand-in? No, no, no! That's not why I did it! That's foie gras! Foie gras! Don't do it! That's foie gras! Damn you! Wow! Yo! - Wow, wow! - Woo! - Wow, wow! - Woo, woo! Wow! Are you finished? - Thank you. - Thanks for the food! Hey, isn't this from A.Lecomte? - The chief's calling me. - You're leaving? - I'm the disappearing butterfly. - You don't have to go. I can apologize to the chief later. It's okay. Anyway, I'm sure the chief would have his suspicions. Really? I'm gonna go. Goodbye. You're really going with the chief? I gotta have some fun. The night is long. Did I do okay? You did. I had a lot of fun. Thank you. To enduring love... Burble, burble! Well, Fujiko Kinugasa-san... I look forward to facing you on-screen one day. Bye bye! That's my handbag! Sorry! That's me! I can't take any more... My pants! My pants! - Come on, let's go! Let's go! - Hold your horses! Hold your horses! I've never felt so miserable in all my life. You're a big deal now too, aren't you, dear? An international playboy. The chief's wife... Was she beautiful? Hold, hold, hold your horses, yeah! C'est, c'est, c'est la vie, ya know? Hold, hold, hold your horses, yeah! C'est, c'est, c'est la vie, ya know? I guess that's it for us, huh? You have every right to be mad. I'll leave in the morning. Don't pretend you don't know. What? You've seen the commercials I do for those rice cookers. I'm supposed to be the model housewife. I'm not allowed to get divorced while I'm under contract. Oh, really? Don't "Oh, really?" me... I'm sure you know. You put on this play so you could get out of here. That's not why I did it. I'm telling you the truth. Hello? Fujisawa-san? Oh! Yes! Oh my, that's quite understandable, of course. However, there's... Yes. Yes! Yes, I totally agree. So, uh... Did Shōhei tell you the whole story? Yes. Yes. Oh, no, no, no! It's all true. Yes. Yes... Oh? Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh... Oh! Oh! Yes, that's right. Yes. Yes, thank you. Yes, that's right. I'll let you go. Yes. I'm very sorry. Yes, thank you. Oh god, Shōhei, what the hell did you do... I let you direct and you go and butcher my poor script... Damn it! Education Is Alive! ♪ Day after day, and week after week ♪ ♪ It looked so real, but just out of reach ♪ ♪ Then when you came close enough to touch ♪ ♪ Like an old building— ♪ You said you were leaving, right, dear? Yeah. Sorry, but we'll have to find some way to get the commercial contract changed. You're right. Well? Which way are you leaving? Which way? Come on, you always use the back door, don't you? What? As the master of the house, aren't you the least bit ashamed to leave through the back? I get it. I'll use the front door this time. What are you saying? Moving out through the front door... People are sure to notice. It might even make it into Bishō... Then I don't have any way out, do I? If you have no way out, then why don't you stay for a while? What? But you'd have to do anything I ask. Like what? Like making me nattō for breakfast! Oh, come on... Let's talk about that girl from before. I told you, she's a part-timer that I hired. She's just a theatre kid. The kind of girl you'd count stars with all night long? Huh? I know what your type is. You really didn't do anything but count stars? You bastard! Ouch! Are you alright?! Let me see! I'm not alright. This really hurts. Let's get something cold on it. Oh? Ah! Cherries jubilee... Huh? What in the... A writer just sparks the fire, huh... Is the power out? So sweet... Produce. Sweets. The chief had a message for you. - A message? - Yeah. He said you two can share me fifty-fifty. Fifty-fifty? Yeah, and he said Nora would be pinch hitting too or something. Is Nora the name of some baseball player? Produce. Refrigerated goods. Sweets. Fresh fish. Produce. Huh? - I'm not buying that. - What? That's a gift from me. Oh? What is it? Can I open it? It's a poisson d'avril. Wow! C'est la vie, ya know? Poisson d'avril: The April Fish. Many a true word is spoken in jest on April Fools' Day. There are times in this life when God stages a stylishly romantic production. Shōhei Nemoto now hosts a regular cooking program featuring his wife, Fujiko. Their close relationship is the subject of much attention. Aren't we all jealous? I'm off! As for Mari Marimura, she visited the island of Aranila at the invitation of Chief Panopora. Her collected essays based on her experience there, known as "The Island Closest to the Sun", became a bestseller. There are rumors that a film version is in the works. Again, aren't we all jealous? Sorry for the wait. We're ready, Director. Then shall we get going? Damn, this is good! Alright, are we ready to roll? - We're rolling! - We're rolling! Mari, Aranila's skies are a beautiful blue! Show me that spirit! I will! Ready... Action!
