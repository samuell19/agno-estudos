If you're troubled by something mysterious Or a problem that's hard to solve, There's a place you can go where you always find help. You just need to look for it. Not again. - Aren't you up yet? - I'm up. I'm up. Whatever. Hey, mom. Really, why do you bother setting an alarm clock? Gotta go. Too bad you don't have time to eat. Mmm, mmm. It's delicious. - That's just mean. - Have a nice day. Oh! Oh, my shoe. Oh. Excuse me? The kingdom is gone, Yet the mountains and rivers remain. And the castle is draped in the vivid green of spring. Haru, we can see you sneaking in, - So just get to your seat. - Yes, sir. Busted. Sorry. It's not fair. First I have a bad morning, Then everyone laughs at me in class. Even Machida was laughing, wasn't he? Yeah, pretty hard. Why me? Why are all these bad things happening to me? Hm, maybe it's some kind of weird omen, Haru. Like your life is gonna get a whole lot worse real soon. Thanks. That helps a lot. That's odd. Never seen him. Why worry about what Machida thinks? - I just think he's so cool. - Tell him. - What if he has a girlfriend? - He does. A cute freshman. Then why tell me to flirt with him? I want a good laugh when he blows you off. - You are terrible. - Machida's not that cool. - My Tsuge is much cooler and... - Careful. - What was that? - Cat burglar. Where's he going? Hey, dumb cat! You'll get killed! - Oh well, it's just a cat. - This doesn't look so good. Ah! What is he doing? Haru, don't! I should be there in... No way. What a catch! Hey, you stupid jerk! Oh, cat, that was close. That was quite a brave act you performed. I am extremely grateful. I hope you are not injured. I don't mean to be rude, but I'm in a hurry. I'll return to thank you properly. Uh, that's okay. Haru! Well, so much for your stick, But at least you rescued that stupid cat. - It talked. - What? That cat spoke to me. Hey, did you hit your head? Mom, I'm home. Watch it! Quilt on the floor. Oh my, this pattern's a disaster. Could you make dinner tonight? - Hey, mom? - Hm-mm. Do you think cats can talk? Sure. Why not? What? You've asked me that question before When you were a little girl. You said, "mommy, did you know I can talk to cats?" - I said that? - Yes. You don't remember? Hmm? Hey, what's wrong? Oh, you're pretty hungry, huh? Do you like fish? They're really good. Here, try some. You're really dirty, kitty. Do you like the fish? See. I told you. - You want some more? Okay, you can have them all. No, you don't need to do anything for me. - Haru. - Mommy! What were you doing over there? I was talking with the kitten. So I asked you what the kitten said to you. And do you know what you said? You said the kitten told you that life is tough. I thought it was so adorable. So it looks like that actually happened. Let's forget about it, go to sleep, And get up in time for breakfast. - huh? Uh... Uh, come over here. - Hm? - Mm-mm. A bit closer. Please allow me to present Our wise and incredibly magnificent ruler, King of cat kingdom, the cat king. That's me, babe. The cat whose life you saved today was none other Than the king's only son prince Lune. Given the magnitude of the matter, The king would like to express his gratitude to you In his own words. Oh. Thanks a lot, babe. A list of what you shall receive. Starting tomorrow, that marvelous array of gifts Will be showered upon you. - Thank you. - Mmmm. Ciao, babe. Just a dream. No way. You don't know anything about this at all? I have no idea. I just woke up. Then where did these come from? Haru, get down here! Look at this. What has happened to our yard? Those look like cat tails. Okay. I must be working too hard. I'm going back to bed. Leave me alone! Stupid cats! Huh? Hey, what do I do with all the lacrosse sticks? Hi, guys. Gotta run. - What is that about? - Does she have catnip on her? - Catnip? What for? - Beats me. No pets on school property, young lady. No! They're not mine! What's going on? Huh? So it wasn't a dream. The cats from last night must be behind this. I'm starting to think it was a big mistake to save that cat. Huh? Stick, cat tails, catnip, mice... - Haru? - What? Did you get the catnip off you? Oh, yes. Someone stuck some in my pockets but it's gone now. Wow, that's weird. Okay, I've got a big favor to ask you. Can you do my cleanup duty today? Tsuge's got a big game And if I don't leave after class, I'll miss it. Please, please, please. Oh, Tsuge. Yeah, sure, I'll do it. Thanks, Haru. You're a lifesaver. Come on, Tsuge. Go! Yeah! Yes! He's so cool! Careful. Watch your step. Thanks. Ah... Hurt... Oh, look at the mess I made. Oh, I missed. Who do I think I'm fooling anyway? There she is. Miss Haru! Miss Haru! Oh... You cats just never let up! Well, we're so glad that you're pleased. - No, I'm not. - How can that be? The whole kingdom is working to make you happy. And we all agreed that the gifts were fabulous. Don't you cats know anything? I hate mice. I'm allergic to cat tails and catnip does nothing for me. Oh, my my my my my. I guess we made a little mistake. Well, this is embarrassing. The king will not be happy when he hears about this. I'm sorry. Did I hurt your feelings? I overreacted, didn't I? I've just been on edge recently. Things have not been going well for me. What kind of things? I don't know. Everything, you name it. I'm shocked to hear this. I suppose even pretty girls like you Have problems like everyone else. - What? Stop. That's enough. - It is nowhere near enough. The kingdom of cats has vowed not to rest Until you are completely satisfied. - There's more? - Yes. How would you like to have a private tour Of the spectacular kingdom of cats? Are you serious? I'm sure you'll love it there. It's a marvelous place. Great food, fabulous scenery And the entire cat kingdom is ready to welcome you. And that's not all. The king is so taken with you, He has awarded you the most valuable gift in the kingdom. You will become his daughter-in-law And marry prince Lune. Huh? Don't think about trying to pull that one on me. There is no way I can marry a cat. The royal family thinks you're good enough And the prince is so cool. - He's cool? - Hm-mm. Hmm... Who knows? Maybe I'd fit in better with a bunch of cats. You get to lie around all day, don't you? - But of course. - Eat all the food you want, Take naps in the sun, forget about all your problems. But me getting married to a cat prince, that's just ridiculous. Right, cat? Fantastic. We'll collect you tonight, then. No, I didn't agree to that. Hey, wait! Ow! Oh, I hurt. Okay, think, Haru. You gotta do something about this. What can I do? Those cats are relentless. They'll find a way to kidnap me and I'll have to marry a cat. I now pronounce you cat and wife. You may kiss the bride. No, no, I don't want to marry a cat! Haru. Haru. What was that? Go to the cat bureau. Find the cat bureau. Hey, come on. Who's there? Who's messing with me now? They will help you there. Look for a large, white cat at the crossroads. He will show you the way. A cat at a crossroad? Find the white cat and go to the cat bureau, Haru. You'll need their help. Find the cat bureau. Never heard of a cat bureau. Look for a large, white cat... At least it was a pleasant voice. Maybe the white cat will be nice, too. That was one long, weird day. I definitely need a break. What in the heck was that? Hey, you big fatso. You cats keep freaking me out. Are you the big, white cat? Are you? Listen, cat. I need to know where the cat bureau is. A voice told me to ask you. Must have the wrong person. I mean cat. I have the wrong cat. Sorry I sat on you. - Wait. I'll show you. - It's him! Wait a minute. Slow down. Isn't there an easier way? Hey. Hey, come on. Guess I shouldn't have called him fatso. Huh? Oh... Wow, this is one weird place. Excuse me, where's the cat bureau? Hello? I need some help right now. I'm gonna get dragged off to the cat kingdom. Could this be it? Enough, baron. Turn it off. No one's impressed with your cheesy light show, okay? Good evening. Welcome to the bureau. Wow, you're cool. Thank you. You're now in a world quite different from your own. This is a refuge for creations. Whenever someone creates something With all of their heart, then that creation is given a soul. Like me and Toto there. That's... That is Toto. A Stone statue with a soul. I see you have a visitor today, baron. How unusual. Indeed. She's quite a fetching one, too. Did he say baron? I am baron Humbert von Gikkingen. The artisan who created me gave me that title. I'll just call you baron. So, you say you're having trouble With those cats from the cat kingdom. Yes. I saved their Prince from getting hit by a truck, And now they won't stop trying to repay me. - I see. - Huh! Serves you right. Thought you'd help the poor kitty, did you? You should've minded your own business. Muta, what's your problem? This girl saved one of your own kind. You should be grateful. Now she's in trouble for it, isn't she? So she was stupid, that's all I'm saying. Where did you find her, Muta? At the crossroads. She knew about the cat bureau. A voice told me about it. I don't know whose voice. - A voice? - You're hearing voices? Check into a loony bin. Don't bother us with... - Knock it off! - You knock it off. - Quit being so catty. - Don't try that again. You guys, I'll just leave. I don't want to cause any trouble. I didn't get your name. Haru. It's Haru. Well, miss Haru, please step into the bureau. Come along. Don't worry about them. Chicken wings! Can't you tell the difference between chickens and crows? I'm not the birdbrain here. I don't look like a giant marshmallow. At least I don't have a bird brain. You already said that. Go fry yourself, you big chicken. You already called me a chicken! This looks close. Wow, this place is beautiful. - Make yourself at home. - Thanks. Milk with your tea, or lemon? - Milk, please. - Good choice. You have great taste, baron. - Here you are. - Thank you. How cute. That's my own personal blend of tea. It's different each time, so I can't guarantee the taste. Wow, that's the best tea I've ever tasted. Then you're lucky. Just tastes like boiled grass to me. Tea is too refined for your crude taste buds. At least I don't eat worms. Muta, have a seat and tell us what you know About the kingdom of cats. It's a dangerous place. You shouldn't go there if you don't believe in yourself. Good point. They said not only will they kidnap me, They're going to force me to marry prince Lune. So, do it. You'll be set for life. - Are you crazy? - It might not be all that bad. That's ridiculous. She won't know until she tries it. Now, then... I've always entertained the idea Of paying a visit to the kingdom of cats. - Now is the time. - Have a nice trip. Hope you make it back some day. You're coming with me. Nah, I'll pass. But thanks for thinking of me. Baron, you're not going to take her there, are you? We can't leave her unprotected. But if Muta wants to stay here, he can keep an eye on her. No way. You can't leave her here. I'm not baby-sitting. - Are you busy at the moment? - Not really. I'll just go home. - Hmm? - What? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to cause you so much trouble. Muta's right. It's my fault for getting involved with the cats. I'll figure something out. Well, then, So sorry the cat bureau couldn't be of any help to you. Ah... All right, all right. I'll watch the little baby. Good kitty. Then it's settled. You can stay here with Muta. - You sure? - Don't worry about Muta. He complains a lot but he has a heart of gold. Hmph! Hm... I see. So he's just a big softie. You could say that. And this is the thanks I get. Thank you for your help, Moo-ta. What? Moo? Are you saying that I'm a fat cow? No, you're just fat. I like this girl more every minute. I'm outta here. Too bad. I was just going to get some Angel fruit cake. - Where is it? - It's in the upper-right shelf. Why didn't you say so? Our guest deserves a proper afternoon tea. This calls for some of my special mulberries. You're too much, baron. A tea party and everything? - Anything I can do to help? - Yes, there is something. I need you to learn just one thing. Always believe in yourself. Then no matter where you are, you will have nothing to fear. Baron, give me a hand with this whipped cream. - You're going all out. - Better believe it. Who knows? Maybe this is the world I belong in. Hey, is that Toto? It's time to go to our kingdom, miss Haru. You again! No! Hey! Get away from me! - Skip the tea. Don't let them take me away, please! Baron, a bunch of cats are headed this way. - Oh no. - A little late, birdbrain. Toto, give me a lift. Ouch! We had a hard time finding you. - Let me off. - What? - Careful, miss Haru. Stop these cats. I want off this thing now. Don't worry. You're just having pre-wedding jitters, that's all. No, I'm not! She could've waited until after we had cake. Ow! Quit that! Let me go. Stop it. It hurts. They're coming for me. - I said let me go. - Okay, Toto. Now! Wait. I take it back! Why did you let him fall? You cats are terrible. You're gonna regret that. Muta! We're over the weight limit. - Toto. - I see it. Let me off this thing! Outmaneuvered. - Get above the trees. - Right. Now what? They're riding the wind. Follow the lights. Got it. Oh, that hurt. Where am I anyway? I can't see a thing. Muta. What happened? You're enormous. No, kiddo. You got smaller. Hm? Why's that? Because we're here, that's why. That's the kingdom of cats? That's it. Wow, there are cats all over the place. What did you expect? It is their kingdom. Hey, you! Ah, it's so relaxing here. Hey, we have to find a way out of here fast. - Relax. - Listen, kid... I've never felt so at home in my life. Hurry. You've got to get out of here. You must leave. You don't belong here. Wow! You're beautiful. Everything's better here. Even the cats. Quickly. You don't have much time. Please, miss Haru, before it's too late. Wait a minute. How do you know my name? Miss Haru! Miss Haru! - Huh? - Oh, not him again. There you are. I finally found you. We seemed to have accidentally dropped you upon entry. Your fat servant exceeded our weight limit. Fat servant? No, this is Muta. He's a friend. That's nice. Come on. Everyone's dying to meet their new Princess. Fat friend, you can come, too. I don't know about this. The king is waiting in your castle. - My castle? - The royal palace. - My castle? - Well, soon enough. Hey, where do you think you're going? The king's waiting for me. It's rude not to say hi. Have you completely lost your mind? - This way. - Wait a minute. Can she come with us? Who are you? I'm Yuki. I serve at the royal table. Oh, so you're employed by the king? She works at the castle. You'll see her there. - Come. - See you soon, Yuki. Ow, ow, ow! Hey! Poor Haru. Ugh, look at that. Creepy. Mmm, looks good. My future daughter-in-law. Hmm. All right! Think I'll go and have a look in person. Hm. Why does that fatso seem so familiar? You'll need to change before meeting the king. I get new clothes? - Please wait here, sir. - I'm the baby-sitter. - Back off. - What's your problem? Help yourself to refreshments while you wait. Yeah, okay, I'll wait. Oh... Hey, not bad. Miss Haru, you're so lucky. Every girl in the cat kingdom has a crush on prince Lune. I'm sure you'll be very happy together. You think? No, wait. I don't think I wanna do this. Wow, don't you look good. Welcome to the royal family, babe. Hmm. Mmm. - Tell me, who is that cat? - I believe his name is Muta. Muta? Never heard that name. No match for my stomach. Hmm... King, I'm really flattered by all this But I don't want to get married. You what? I was told you had already consented. She has consented. That's what I was told. What does the prince say? He is away on official business. Look, first of all, we don't really know each other And second of all, he's a cat, right? And I'm not. So, clearly, I can't marry him. - Huh? - Huh? That has already been taken care of. You're half cat already. Oh... See, miss Haru? Look at that. I'm a cat. Muta! Muta, what happened? He had a weakness for catnip jelly. He saw the bowl and dove right in. Muta, you weren't supposed to die. It's all my fault. Don't leave me like this, Muta. Time for the celebration. No, I won't leave him! Then we'll bring him with us. - That's prince Lune's bride. - She has lovely fur. And such delicate paws. I hear you don't care for mice But I bet you can't resist my juicy, raw fish, huh? I'm not sure she's enjoying herself. - How about some entertainment? - Excellent suggestion. - Not entertaining enough. - Yes, sire. Next. Whoever's next better not stink. Got it? Your majesty, I promise that I will make the young lady smile. - Shall we try him? - Sure. Why not? Huh? Excuse me. Would you care to dance? Oh no, I'm a meow-sy dancer. Now I'm starting to talk like a cat. Just trust me. Well, she seems to be entertained now. What's happening to me? I've never felt like this before. Maybe life as a cat wouldn't be so bad. Careful, Haru. Don't lose yourself. Huh? Believe in who you are. I said so before, didn't I? Then you must be... Stop right there, pal! You're not from my kingdom, are you? Exactly who are you? How rude of me. I should have introduced myself. I am exactly who I appear to be. I am baron Humbert von Gikkingen and I have come for Haru. Baron! - He's so cool. - He is handsome. He can't have her. Seize them! I'm stuffed. Muta? You're still alive! Oh no! Give me back my daughter-in-law. Quickly, get his majesty to a safe place. Emergency exit for all guests. Enjoy your day. Great technique, Muta. I just lost my balance. Over here. Yuki, you're here. I'm so thankful you were able to help miss Haru, baron. Do we know each other? Many of us here know of you and your bureau. Yuki, I'm an idiot. I should've left when you said. Now look at me. If you leave here by dawn, You can still turn back into a human. I will? This will get you outside the castle. - Perfect. - Wait. Where's Muta? Hmm. He'll be fine. We just need to get you home. The back of the castle. The door to your world is at the top of that tower. You've got to be kidding me? The only way to get to the tower is through the king's maze. Naturally. Good luck. And, baron, take good care of Haru. Hey, wait. She's already gone. I didn't have a Chance to thank her. Haru, does her voice sound familiar to you? Is it possible that she told you to seek help at the cat bureau? Haru, go to the cat bureau. You must find the cat bureau. You're right. That was her voice. But why help me? Ah! Ah! Ah! Whose idea was it to leave without me? I nearly got killed. This is no time for finger pointing. You're leaving me again? - Are they going in? - Yes, they've just begun. Purr-fect. No one's ever come out alive, have they? We can watch them go nuts from over here. Hurry, we don't have much time. - It's still noon. - It's always noon here. What? What do you mean? At home, it's already after midnight. What? We've got to go faster. Where do we go? They're lost already? They're doing worse than most of our victims. Pleased, your majesty? Feeling good, babe. - Where are the guards? - Right there. Hut, hut, hut, hut... Let's start with this path. If we're methodical, we'll find our way. Keep your eye on the tower. That will allow us to stay oriented. Good idea. Muta, you're cheating. Gimme a break. You think I'll get in trouble? He's cheating. She's gonna rub this in my face, isn't she? Let's get out of here while Muta keeps them occupied. Again, I'm tricked into being bait. Stay behind me, Haru. Wow! Oh, how's your cane? Bent, but it's about time for a new one anyway. I never knew they were so useful. Nice shot, sire. - Oh no, you hit one of ours. - I did? - Your majesty, how could you? - Let's keep that between us. Excuse me, but I think there's a bit of a problem. Our guards are scattered. Don't tell me they're lost, too? Where's my Princess? She's already halfway through. - Hey! - You found us. - What's that way like? - Just dead ends. Now this is more like it, babe. Hm, another dead end. My, my, this is getting interesting. Two rights and a left... Wait a minute, I know there wasn't a wall here. Your brain's overheating. We just walked through here, Muta. What, walls have legs? She's right, Muta. This wall is fake. - Told you. - Good work, Haru. All right, fine, good work. How stupid do you have to be to line up like dominoes? - Princess! - It's not safe, your majesty. Go ahead. I'll catch up to you. Oh! What a show-off. - I can walk. - Don't worry. Hmm? Your majesty! This is very dangerous. I can't let them escape. You'll never reach them in time. Besides, we have guards in the tower. Why didn't you say so? Toast. Whoa! - I'll speak to the contractors. - It's too late for that. We'll have to use the detonator. Not that, I beg of you, sire. Think of what it will do to your approval ratings. - Button. - I left it in the castle. - Look what I found. - No! Oh! No! Hey, we made it to the top. Not much further now. Bye-bye, tower. - Baron! - Brace yourselves. Excellent explosion, your majesty. Let's go. You've got to be kidding. We're back where we started. Now what do we do? Just stand here? Nothing else we can do. Hut, hut, hut, hut... Quick, quick! Get 'em! Get 'em! Baron, nice to see you again. Princess, would you please accompany me back to the castle? Being a cat's not so bad. Do I have to learn to eat mice? Perhaps you shouldn't give up quite yet, Haru. What in the world has father done now? Father! Lune? You're back already? The prince is here. Line up! It's the prince? Yuki sent a message saying it was urgent I return. Perhaps you'd like to tell me what's going on? Miss Haru! - Yuki, you're here. - I'm glad Lune made it in time. I just wanted to repay the girl who rescued you. And I thought, just maybe, you would be happy To have a good-looking girl like Haru for a bride. I have already chosen my bride. I have decided to marry Yuki. That thing? - Guess it was a surprise. - I like this prince. This is for you. I traveled to your old home to get these. I haven't had these in years. Wow. I used to love those when I was a kid. I know. You fed me a whole box when I was just a stray. That filthy little kitten was you? You're so beautiful now, I never would have recognized you. Will you accept these crackers as a symbol of my love for you For as long as our nine lives shall last? So these crackers mean that You can marry the Prince instead of me! I'm so happy for you. Thank you, Haru. Thank you for feeding me when I was a kitten. Without you I might not be alive today. You're the girl with the fish crackers Yuki told me about. And you also rescued me when I nearly got killed by a truck. We both owe you our lives, Haru. What can we do to repay you? You don't have to repay me. I'm just glad things are fine. I guess I did the right thing after all. This is all very moving. I had no idea you had a bride in mind already. You should've told me. Poor Haru. You must feel like such a loser. - Not really. - I'm sure you do. So, I have a great idea. You should marry me instead. I'll get you some fish, too, As a symbol of my undying love and all that. So? That's very generous, but I just want to be myself. I'll change you back if you marry me. Hm? I've had just about enough of you. Nobody who decided who I am but me, And there's no way I'd ever marry you. - Was that a no? So you're not ready to get hitched then, huh, kid? - Not a Chance. I respect a woman who stands up for herself. Even if she does stick her nose in other people's business. So I, Renaldo Moon, will defend her. - Renaldo? - Renaldo Moon? - The Renaldo Moon? - So that's who he is. - Who? - How could you have forgotten? He's a notorious criminal whose story is written on our walls. Years back, an enormous white cat appeared, Devoured all the fish in the lake and then ran off. He called himself Renaldo Moon. Did you really do that, Muta? That's disgusting. And this time I'll eat the entire castle. Hurry! Get his majesty to safety, now! Protect Haru from the king. Yes, sir. Cat guard, advance. Oh, you traitor. Please, sire, it's not safe. Take miss Haru to the exit. I'll hold back the king. The tower collapsed. It's all right, the exit is still there. - The Sky. - Oh no, the sun's rising. I'll get her to the exit. - Nice. - Run, Haru. Hurry. Good luck, and thank you. Mm-hm. Goodbye, Yuki. I wasn't wrong to save a cat. No matter what happens, I believe in my decision. I believe. I believe. - I'll hold them off. - Thanks, Muta. - Where's the king? - Up there. Father, you'll hurt yourself. Get down. Has he lost his mind? I'll find a way to get him down. Fight like a cat, you chicken! With pleasure. - Need help? - Take care of Haru. You got it. I win, king. How embarrassing. I heard rumors about a nosy cat figurine Who likes to help others with their problems. I assumed you'd be a kitschy knick-knack that collected dust. Had I known you were this good, I'd have asked you to come and work for me. I prefer a life of sticking my nose in other's problems. Where am I? What have you done? I didn't do anything. The tower is hundreds of feet shorter now. I wouldn't be surprised if the exit had moved as well. - Oh no, the exit moved! - We should have foreseen this. But, look, she's not a cat any more. Help me! I'm going to fall. I'm going! Haru! Muta, I hope I'm not too heavy. From now on, you're not allowed to make... ...any more fat jokes. I'm sorry, Muta. Hold on! I don't wanna die. You're not dead yet. Open your eyes. - Baron? - Spread your arms. Look down. I can't. I'm scared. Just trust me. - Are you sure we're alive? - Yes. For now. I think I could learn to like this. What are all these chickens doing here? - A flock of crows? - Perfect timing. So, Muta, how does it feel to be saved by a bunch of birdbrains? - It sure took you long enough. - Nice work, Toto. I'm just glad I had enough friends hanging out in the area. Are you sure we're not too heavy? - You're light as a feather. - Thanks. I beg to differ. Haru, look. That's my school. I don't believe it. I'm gonna make it home. Thank you, everyone. Unbelievable. We won't forget you, miss Haru. Your majesty? I've been thinking. It may be time for me to retire. I think I shall accompany you, sire. Thanks, Toto. Oh boy, my heart is still pounding. - Scared, were you? - Yes. But I had fun, too. Really? I didn't. Well then, now that Haru's problem is solved, We should let her go home and get some rest. Catnap. I guess this is goodbye? One last chore to do. Baron, just for the record, I think I may have a little crush on you. Just for the record, I admire a woman who speaks from the heart. If you ever need us, you will know how to find us again. And the bureau's doors will be open to you, be it day or night. Until then, trust yourself. Goodbye. I'll miss you! Toto. Baron. And fatso! - Fatso? I heard that. - She's only telling the truth. Shut up, birdbrain. Don't give me that again or I might drop you. Shut up, you birdbrain. Oh! I've got to get up. Morning. Haru? What are you doing up so early? - It's not even a school day. - I'm going out with Hiromi. - Don't want to waste the day. - Huh? So... I made some breakfast for both of us. - What? - I'm done so help yourself. And I made some tea, too. - Oh, by the way,... ...That's my own special blend of tea. It's different every time so I can't guarantee the flavor. Oh, okay. What do you know? Smells good. That's a great outfit. I got some big news you'll be excited about. Yeah? What is it? Machida broke up with his girlfriend. - Oh, that's too bad. - What? Are you kidding? - What do you mean? - I thought you'd be ecstatic. Not really. Doesn't matter any more. - Hey, are you okay? - I'm fine. - Liar. - I'm better than ever. What's going on with you and Tsuge? Nothing new. - Come on. - Nothing's happening.
