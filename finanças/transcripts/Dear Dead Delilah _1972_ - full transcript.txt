(upbeat guitar music) (somber radio jazz music) (engine rumbling) 26. 27. 29. 30. 31. 32. 33. 34. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41. 42. 43. 44. 45. It's so hot! I can't catch my breath, mother. That old electric fan doesn't do any good. Just stirs up all the hot air. I think I'll wear my blue pacha. It's too fancy for the USO but Don likes it. When the war is over, he'll come back and marry me. He wants to marry, mother, I can tell. (somber jazz radio music) You'll like Don when you get to know him. I promise you'll like him. He's not the way you say he is. He wouldn't take advantage of me. (thudding) He loves me, mother. I know he loves me. - [Radio Announcer] And now the old clock on the wall says it's 8:17 PM and for all those gals down there at the USO, here's "The GI Blues." (upbeat big band radio music) - Ready. I'd better run. You don't know how Don fusses at me if I'm even two minutes late. There it is. (ominous music) (eerie music) Mother'? Don't you wanna talk to me? No wonder that fans not doing any good. You've got it tilted too high. (ominous music) There. That's better, isn't it? You'll be nice and cool now. Well don't just stare at me. You could at least say, "Have a good time" or something, couldn't you, mother? I'm not mad at you anymore. (teapot whistling) I don't really hate you. I just said that. (teapot whistling) (clinking) (ominous music) I'm not mad. - So long, Luddy. Take care of yourself, now. - It's a quarter now, ma'am. - On. (upbeat music) (guys hollering) (upbeat music) - [Football Player] Hike! Hike! Hike! (men hollering) (groaning) - Now they've done it. - Maybe we better get a doctor. - What's the matter with her, Ellen? Is she hurt badly? - I don't think so. She's coming around now. Hi. - What happened? - You got trampled on by an ape. Would you like to sit up now? - Yes, please. . He)'- Here I am. She drew me. - Would you like us to take you to the university hospital? It's only two blocks away. - Oh, no. There no need to trouble. I just had the wind knocked out. I'll be fine in a minute. - Would you let us take you home? - Home? - I'm afraid I haven't any place to go. # Give me that old time religion # Give me that old time religion # Give me that old time religion # It's good enough for me I Makes you love everybody (car honking) (tires screeching) I Makes you love everybody # It's good enough for me (pleasant music) - [Football Player] 17 rooms in all, Luddy, and 24 acres. There were five thousand acres once but all that land was lost through a curse. " [Luddy] A curse? - [Football Player] The curse of South Hall Plantation. Strangely enough, it only afflicted the male members of the family. None of them could fill an inside straight but they all died trying. - [Luddy] Oh, they gambled. - They'd bet on the number of fleas on a dog's ass. Mam; gamma) - I'm afraid I'm gonna be in the way here. - We better go in now. I've been gone most of the afternoon and-- - [Football Player] And Delilah will be screaming for a bath or is this the day you trim her toenails? - Not now, Richard. My aunt is an invalid. - Invafid? She's dead! Been dead for the past eight years going on nine. - [Ellen] Richard. - Or is it ten years? Dear dead Delilah. Yes, the mercy of the Lord is infinite but His sense of timing is out of whack. - Richard is trying to say that my Aunt Delilah-- - ls wasting away but oh so very slowly and at the top of a voice. Obviously South Hall has more than its share of curses. Coming Luddy? Hey Luddy, what's the matter? - I'm fine. You don't need to go to any trouble for my sake. - What the devil is going on? Who is that woman? - I don't believe I ever seen her before, Delilah. It appears that she may have injured herself somehow. - Oh, don't be an idiot. You know the way Richard drives. Obviously run the woman down and now he's dumping the whole mess in my lap. Well, this time they can throw him in the cooler for all I care. See that she has a doctor if she needs one. Get her to sign a release. And get Richard up here when he's had a drink to stint his nerves. - Are you dismissing me, Delilah? - Uh huh. You might have the kindness to get me another brandy before you go. - We were discussing a matter of utmost gravity before we were interrupted. - Interruption was providential. The subject is closed. - I have not as yet had my say. - And you will have your say. - What you propose to do is immoral. - Is that all? - Not to mention, destructive. - On. Oh, destructive. Now you tell me, Ray, how can I destroy people when they've already succeed in destroying themselves? - No, Delilah, I've known all of you ever emee you were a pup. I'm not as hard on those boys are you are. There's good in them that's come out. The pendulum swing both ways. - I have a brother who's a thief and a failure and another brother who's a charlatan and a failure. As for Grace, gentle Grace, my beloved sister. There's not a benevolent bone in her body. Of all of them, she hates me the most. There's no hatred burns like the hatred of the chronically weak. (clanking) Oh. Oh, clean that up for me, Ray, will you before you go? - When do you intend telling the family? Of course, I should be there. - [Delilah] I'll leave that to papa's discretion. - That is a surprising condition, considering your papa has been in his grave 20 years. - We seldom agree on anything, Ray, particularly on the nature of death. While some people hear God on their prayers, I hear papa. Loud and clear. - He left you with an enormous amount of power. - Papa knew that I understood power. - You still have time to change your mind. - I would've married you, Ray. You know that, don't you? - Yes, I know. - Well, it's done and we've done it together. I wanna give you a word of advice. Spend that money you so faithfully earned. Go to Paris. - Paris? - How often have I heard of your fond ambition to visit the city of Paris again? Well, it's the fall of the year, Ray, and Paris may never be more beautiful. But if you choose to stay at South Hall and listen to the wind whistling through the bones of family pride, I warn you, I'm not responsible. I won't feel one drop of pity when my brothers flay you alive. - You fear for my safety? - What else? - What else, indeed. I'm not only your lawyer, I also represent your brothers and Grace. - They have no rights. No recourse. Papa saw to that. You wouldn't dare have me committed. You can't buy my physicians. And you can't buy me the time to rot in an institution! Besides, papa would be very angry if you had me committed. You have no idea how angry. - I've survived his anger before. I survived the harshes of many men. - I'm devoted to you, Ray. But I know my brothers. Go to Paris. - Good afternoon, Delilah. - Good afternoon to you, Ray. (door closing) I don't know, papa, he might have been better than no husband at all. # All the children of the world # Red and yellow or black and white I We are precious, every sight - Where? Where is this? (crickets chirping) - How're you feeling? - I have a headache. - Alonzo, she's awake now. Can you come? How bad is the headache? - [Luddy] It's not so bad. - I don't want you to think I'm snooping but we didn't know anything about you. I looked at some of these drawings. They're very good. - Well, thank you. - And I looked in your purse. You've been in prison, haven't you? - Yes. - Well, don't worry. Nobody will hold that against you. Most of the people who've lived in this house either went to jail or deserve to go. Not yet, let the doctor see you first. - There's a doctor here? - My cousin, Alonzo. He lives here. He's not allowed to practice medicine anymore but he'll probably know what to do for a headache. Well, you don't have to take his advice if you don't want to. Why were you in prison? If I'm not being too nosy. - I killed someone. - On. - My mother. - Did she deserve it? - I can't remember anymore. I was... I was as old as you are now. - Well, we won't tell anybody. It's nobody's business anyhow. We'll say that you're a... a housekeeper. Think you'd make a good housekeeper'? They don't last long around here. - Well, Miss Dublin, I was beginning to be concerned about you. - She complained of a headache, Alonzo. - I usually wake up with a headache. I have a little sinus problem. - [Delilah] Ellen, where are you? I can't sleep. I think some night air might help. - Yes, Aunt Delilah, I'll be right there. - Now, sit up, please. (door closing) There. Now just bend forward. Thank you. - What a lovely girl. - She has taken care of Delilah almost single handedly for three years. We've had other nurses, of course, in relief of Ellen but none have seemed to be able to last more than a week. Delilah's requirements are very strict, indeed. Like any good general, she thinks only of the battle and she has fought death to a standstill for more years than I care to recall. - How long can she go on? - If you're going to be working here never remind Delilah in any way that she is ill. - Oh, I won't. - Good. Well, no sign of concussion but we'll keep a close watch on you for a couple of days. I hope you won't mind staying here for the rest of the night. - No, I don't mind. She's 26, isn't she? - Ellen? Well, I guess she would be about 26. Is that what she told you? - She didn't have to tell me, I knew. - Well, I'll leave you some asprin in case you wake up during the night. - My own daughter's 26. She was born on the 2nd of October. - Libra, oh. Where is your daughter now? Nashville? - I don't know. I only saw her once then they took her away from me forever. I wasn't supposed to see her at all. It's easier that way, they tell you. I never completely lost consciousness during delivery, so I did get to see her, just a few seconds. Blonde little girl. She didn't cry. Isn't that unusual? I never cried either. I knew that someday I was gonna see her again. - I hope that's true. (crickets chirping) You never lost consciousness? And you count that as a blessing. I wish I could feel the same. - Did you have a daughter or a son? - I don't know what the sex of the child might have been. I only know that it was mine. The mother was barely 16. - I understand. - I have known men with worse obsessions. - Did you love the girl? - I cared enough that I had to nerve myself for it till I was past all clarity or comprehension. The girl... died. You can't imagine the consequences to me. # Jesus loves the little children # All the children of the world There never have been enough children in this house. Through some inherited quark of ego, most of the Charles women have flatly refused marriage and on those occasions where it was forced on them, they took revenge on their husbands with stillborns. Incompetence. Now there's Delilah and Grace and Morgan and Alonzo. And no children between us. Someday. Someday soon. And you may see it if you stay to work here. South Hall will be spilling over with children. The sickly, the unwanted, the abandoned, I won't turn an child away. - What a lovely idea. - It would be redemptive. - I'll help you if you need me. (laughing) (ice clinking) - Your wife is being very entertaining tonight. - But not half so entertaining as me. - Someday you will learn that women of sensibility despise your crowing. - Women learn to like everything about me. (chuckling) There are two ways you talk to me, while your hands are shaking and after. Did you manage to get in that little chat with Delilah's specialist? - [Woman] I talked to them. - You're not hanging crepe. What do they have to say? - She defies their skill and ridicules their experience. Doctors. They're nothing but a pack of money grubbers. If any one of them had the spirit or mercy. - He'd do away with Delilah and put you out of your misery. This house mean a lot to you, Grace? - I've always loved South Hall. Lovely, it my place of birth. - Without it you wouldn't have much status in Nashville. Enough money to live on but not the status you crave. - My status has nothing to do with it. - Where would you be without your fox hunts and your steeplechase? It's a good thing Delilah indulges your fancies. - What are you talking about? - It is her land. - That is not true and it will never be true. - Oh, come on, Grace! That's known as self-delusion. Your papa didn't trust anybody but Delilah to handle things. South Hall Plantation is in her name and nobody else's. And Delilah could boot you out tomorrow if she wanted to. - Don't talk to me that way you miserable little opportunist. - How come you haven't done it, Grace? - Done what? - I'm talking about a mercy killing. - How dare you? - Opportunist. I've invested two years in this death watch. And believe me, there have been other opportunities. Have you ever gotten your hands really dirty, Grace? And I'm not talking about weeding rose gardens. - Soon after the supply train was burned our Calvary boys caught the Yankees napping down by the race track and chased them all the way up here to the house. You can imagine the ruckus. The shooting and hollering. The bullets must've been thick as bees around the hollow tree. (somber music) While all this fighting was going on, my grandmother, Sydney Charles, she couldn't have been any more than 14 at the time, she stood in full view on the lawn, oblivious to the bullets, waving a handkerchief, cheering the boys to go on. Never a thought for her own safety. (Delilah laughing) She's was dead game. (axes thudding) I have the boys chop all our firewood. I can't abide the whining of those saws. (eerie music) Now, Luddy, in that building over there, we have stored one of the the finest collections of carriages in the south. (axes thudding) We used to spruce them up for their annual spring pilgrimage. That was back in the 30s when things were still done with some style, despite the fact the world was crashing down around my papa's head. Oh, I wish you could've seen it, Luddy. The bells and the hoop skirts, the brass and shining leather of the carriages. It's hot for this season of the year. I believe I've had too much sun myself. Your color isn't good at all, Luddy. I'm afraid you've been taking your duties much too seriously in the short time that you've been with us. Now I told you, I want you to consider yourself to be a member of the family. (axes thudding) (eerie music) - Oh, I never expected anything like this! Oh, you're just gonna have to give me a minute to catch my breath, Morgan. - Only a minute, baby duck. I'm anxious to see my family. It's been a long, long time. Well, there's Ray. Hello there, Ray. Been duck shooting yet? - Almost every other day this week. Morgan, it's a pleasure to see you looking so good. Ma'am. - Buffy, may I introduce my cousin, Ray Jurroe. You know something, Ray, I never have been able to figure out just exactly how it is we're cousins. - Oh, I know how that is. I've got a whole slew of cousins. They were just always on the foot while I was growing up. Well, it sure is a pleasure to meet you. - Ray's a legal eagle. - Oh, I've always been so fond of layers. - I do hope we have the pleasure of seeing you at South Hall later on, miss. - It's misses. I expect I'll be here a little while, yes. - Tell me, how's Delilah? - As well as-- - Can be expected. Same old song and dance, huh? - Lately, I must say, I've noticed she's losing ground more rapidly. As usual, she claims the end is near. - Heard that before. Well, Delilah's nothing. She's not dead game, you've gotta say that for her. - Also, she seems to be losing her grip on reality. - Oh? Her mind's gone, is that it? - No. I didn't say that at all. Well, I'm afraid I'm a little late for an appointment. Morgan. Miss Buffy. - We'll have to have a talk real soon, Ray. - Oh, yeah, sure. Very soon, I'm leaving for Paris Wednesday morning. - Paris! Oh, I just know you're going to love it there, Mr. Jurroe! - All right, baby duck. - Hello, Morgan! - Hello there, Grace! That's my sister. (ominous music) (eerie music) (thudding) - Marshall? - Yes, sir? - [Alonzo] Where is Richard? - I don't know, Mr. Alonzo. I believe he went riding with Miss Grace. - Find him and tell him that I need him at once. (unsettling music) (somber music) - Dressing for dinner, Cousin Alonzo? - Where is it? - Oh, sure. - Give it to me. Give it to me! - Here. You oughta try injecting it under you tongue. That way, you'll never leave any marks. - I'm sill able to give myself an injection without leaving any marks. You should've been here hours ago! - I had some of other business to take care of. (sighing) - You mean... You were taking care of Grace. - We went riding. Honest. - Ellen will refuse to see only so much. Only so long. - [Richard] Those sound like threatening words, cousin. - You stop calling me cousin. I am not related to you in anyway. - You might say we are brothers under the skin, except I knew when to quit. - You know I have not been well. - [Richard] You've been missing a lot of meals. You'd be surprised how much your appetite would improve if you'd stay off the junk. - Would you please tell my family that I will be a little late for dinner? - Right on. Just don't forget to come. Command performance, no exceptions. I think we're all going to be treated to a lecture on how badly we're wasting the family resources. - Leave me alone, Richard! (door closing) (people chattering) - Morgan, guess what. Mr. Jurroe wants to borrow me for a little while and take me to Paris with him. (laughing) - Do what you want, Ray. I'll trade you Buff even up for that sweet, little old Winchester 16 gage of yours. - Even up? Well, you are talking about a mighty fine shotgun. - Oh, now you're both being horrible. (laughing) (people chattering) - [Alonzo] Children are the salt of the earth. Nothing else worth living for. (laughing) - [Grace] No, no, no, you're getting the story all wrong. Lady Tompkins was hereto tender the chestnuts. (people chattering) (voices hushing) (people chattering) I know things can't ever be like they were but doesn't this remind you of the good time we had when papa was here? - Papa is always here, Grace. He's never left. Don't you forget that. - Let's not be morbid. - Gentlemen, as we're all too bloated to move for now, you may light up your cigars if you wish. - May I sincerely say bon voyage just one more time? - I believe we said all the necessary farewells to Ray. But other farewells must be spoken while there's still time. While we're all gathered here. - Delilah's gonna make a speech. - On the contrary, Grace, I've made my speeches year in and year out and a fat lot of good they've done. None of you had a gross worth of sense when it came to mind. As a result, it's been a desperate struggle to hold together what pitiful few workers we have. - Delilah, you trying to say we're broke? I can't believe that. You've got too keen a head for figures. - No, no, we're not broke. South Hall, itself, is worth somewhere close to a million dollars. And the major trust is currently valued at one million, six hundred and 14 thousand, nine hundred and 84 dollars and 23 cents. - Well, that's tight enough sum. Little more of this cognac, please, Marshall! - Delilah, I never dreamed you'd have the poor taste to discuss such matters in front of strangers and guests. - You always did overrated my taste, Ray. Yes, a tidy sum. But the income from it has barely been enough to pay our taxes and maintain certain of us in our flights of profit. And my medical bills have been truly staggering. - [Grace] Amen to that. - That is one burden the three of you will no longer have to bear. It saddens me to announce that the conclusion of this gala feast and I do not have long to live. Perhaps 30 days, perhaps 60. Not long. - On. - Oh, for God sake, baby duck! Now, Delilah, I've come rushing home many times before under the misapprehension that you-- - I have papa's word on it that I will soon be joining him. - I just don't think I can sit here and listen to you go on-- - Grace, sit down. I don't think you'll wanna miss what comes next. - What comes next? - The question is, once I'm gone, what's to become of South Hall and the trust I administer? - Well, all right, now you've gone ahead and opened up that can of worms. - None of you have any more reverence for your home and heritage than a grasshopper. If it was left to your own devices, you'd snap up the first descent bid and in six months time, this property would be overrun with bulldozers. Papa and I could never allow that to happen. Therefore, I have willed South Hall Plantation to the state. - What? - Oh, dear Lord. - Along wit ha suitable sum of money and it will be maintained forever just as it has been in the last century. - Now, listen here, Delilah! - Forever! - Ray, are you just gonna sit there and say nothing? - You're always willing to have Delilah in charge, Morgan. - No, you can't do that. We talked. You agreed, you said it would be a marvelous thing for my children. - Alonzo, you're a miserable fool. - What the devil's gonna happen to us? What about our share? - Oh, yes. Oh, yes, your share. I've made provisions. Each of you will receive the sum of five thousand dollars of my trust. That oughta last you something like 30 days, Morgan, if I may judge form your past performances. - Five thousand dollars? - And my personal blessings. - Delilah, you're sure enough looking for a fight. - If it's only money that concerns you. Luddy, will you help me, please? Unlock that, Luddy, please. Pass it around. - Ugh. It smells. Smells moldy. These are hundred dollar bills. Where have you been hiding these? Hundreds, 50s, 20s. Nearly 12 thousand dollars. - I don't understand this, Delilah. - It's very simple, Morgan. I have found papa's horse money. - Horse money? I thought that was a myth. - Let me in on it. - Yeah, tell him Ellen. - Well, some years ago, back in 1930-- 4931. - When South Hall was in bad trouble because of the Wall Street crash, Uncle Bailey was forced to sell off his entire stable of thoroughbreds in order to pay off his bills and taxes. It was one of the best racing stables in the world and the auction attracted representatives of kings and sultans. - Indeed, it did. - But before the horses could be sold there was a terrible fire and some of the best horses were destroyed. Or at least as far as anyone knew, they were the best. - The thoroughbreds were secretly sold south of the border. The insurance company's paid off, which settled all accounts and papa had 600 hundred thousand cash money beside. That money he hid here on the plantation. That was his insurance against another rainy day. - I never have believed that of papa. I can't believe he'd reson to short practices. - On. He would've resorted to murder to save South Hall from the ravages of time and from his own children. - All right, so you've found papa's horse money, so what about it? - Why, it's all yours. All you children have to do is to find it like I did. First come, first serve. 600 thousand dollars. Luddy, let's get out of here. - Delilah, you are crazy as an old hoot owl and you're not gonna get away with this! - Morgan. Alonzo. You too, Ray. Come to the den. (sighing) (elevator buzzing) This is family business, if you don't mind. (whistling) (ominous music) - Luddy, close the door. I want to be alone for awhile. (ominous music) Papa? I did it. I did it, papa. (whistling) - We will break that will. - Grace, we haven't got the means to fight it. I give you my word on that. - Delilah gave me her solum word. - I am sorry about that, Alonzo. - So there's nothing we can do? - Accept the fact that Delilah is going to have her way. - To hell she is. - What about this?! - All that talk about finding papa's horse money, that's all a lie. She's just trying to torment us. - I'm not too sure about that, Grace. - You mean she actually found it. How could she? She's a cripple. - She says papa told her where to look for it. - But somebody had to go and fetch it for her. - It appears to be the case, under the circumstances. - Somebody like you, Ray? - Now, Morgan, I don't know anything about that horse money. Except what Delilah in her infinite wisdom has chosen to tell me. - You know something, cousin Ray? - What's that, Morgan? - I ain?t so sure I believe you. (ominous music) (moaning) - Momma. Momma. (ominous music) Momma! (whimpering) No! No! No! No! Momma! Mam; gamma) Stop, momma! (glass shattering) (whimpering) (somber jazz music) (eerie music) (saw buzzing) (gasping) (ominous music) I'm thirsty, mother. (thunder rumbling) (eerie music) (whimpering) (foreboding music) - [Mother] Luddy! (thunder rumbling) Luddy! (foreboding music) (thunder rumbling) (crow squawking) Luddy! (wind howling) (thunder rumbling) (gasping) - Momma? (thunder rumbling) (horse huffing) (foreboding music) Who is it? Who's there? (gasping) (menacing music) (horse neighing) (gasping) (thudding) - Luddy! Why? Don't know. - Luddy! - They'll send me to prison again. I was dreaming. I couldn't have done it. - I saw you with the ax and that hand. Where did you get the ax, Luddy? - I found it. - Where? - Out there on the ground. Don't you believe me? - Why yes, Luddy, I think I do. I've been in prison myself. I know how you feel. (crying) Stop that, Luddy, stop that! Look at me! I mean to help you. He was never a good man, Luddy. He never thought about anybody but himself. He was never, never my friend. All I ever wanted in my whole life, Luddy, was just one true friend. Can you understand that? Right now I need a friend, Luddy. I require your help. I must find papa's horse money before Grace or Morgan can get their hands on it. I need that money for my children! May be too late already. They won't stop me now. I can't have the police here, Luddy. NOW. We're gonna have to do something out Uncle Ray. We're gonna have to find a place to put him. Are you up to that, Luddy? - Yeah. - Good. Now there's a... There's a wheelbarrow around the corner. Will you fetch it, please? - Yes, Alonzo. (crickets chirping) (horses neighing) (dramatic music) - Good morning, Delilah. - Good morning, Morgan. How'd you sleep in your old bed? - Like a log, sister, like a log. Put the tray over there, would you please, May? Thank you, kindly. I thought I'd come up and have a little breakfast with you. - Lord love you, Morgan. - Sleep well yourself, sister? - Like an old hoot owl. - Oh well, now. I was a little upset when I called you that and I guess it was the wine talking. - Bring those mums over here so I get a better look at them. That's very thoughtful of you, Morgan. You finally learned how to please a woman after all these years. (laughing) - I never had to learn any lessons when it came to women, Delilah. - What about this one your have with you now? Gonna marry her? - Buffy? Now where would I be if I went around marrying all the Buffys of this here world? Delilah, I really need to talk to you. - I figured that. You got the financial miseries? - Worst than I can ever remember. I'm hereto eat humble pie, Delilah. - Papa would be very pleased of these flowers, Morgan. Why don't we go down to the mausoleum and pay our respect? On the way, you could tell me about this new case of the miseries. - Thank you, Delilah. (laughing) So it's a matter of little over 40 thousand dollars, Delilah. - When are the auditors due? - A week from tomorrow. (laughing) - That's all the time you have left to enjoy being a free man. - I swear to you, Delilah, I never meant to get in so deep. - So you were working over the books, huh? - Now, Delilah, that's not a proper assessment to the situation. - Oh, Morgan. You're finally gonna get the can tied to your tail. This time there's nothing Delilah can do. - There's plenty you can do. (Delilah chuckling) - Delilah just won't be here much longer. When are you ever gonna learn to take care of yourself? - Delilah, I ain't asking you to tell me where papa's horse money is hid. All I'm asking if for a little piece of it to tie me over. I swear to you, I don't care about the rest of it. You can give it to Grace or Alonzo. All I'm asking for is 40 thousand dollars. - You know something, Morgan? I never told this to a living soul. But I guess, deep down, you've always been my favorite. - I know that, Delilah, that's what-- - Now shush! Listen to a little piece of advice. Now really listen for the first time. - Delilah, whaf are you trying to do to me? - Try to make a man of you. Better late than never. - 40 thousand dollars, now that ain't asking for the whole world. - My advice is take your lumps this time. Touch bottom. Then there won't be any place to go but up. - Delilah, this time it means jail. - Two years with good behavior. It's much more time than I have to look forward to. - I ain't going to jail just to satisfy you, sister! There's measures I can take and I'll be wise to take them! - Morgan wanted you to have these nice flowers this morning, papa. - Delilah! You hear me in there, Delilah?! (birds chirping) - Morgan! Morgan! Morgan! I was just out for a walk before breakfast-- - I never suspected you'd tum out to be an early riser, Buffy. - And I found this! I mean, I stepped on it. - Look, Buffy, I'm in no frame of mind for company right now! - No, just look at it, Morgan! Look inside. - What the devil? - It's an old 50 dollar bill. Even with all that crude on it, you can tell what it is. - Where'd you find it? - Away over there, near that tumbled down shack. The grounds been dug up lately and filled back in again. Morgan, do you supposed that 50-- - I don't know. I don't know. Just don't say it because if it is. - And there are more cans like that over there. - Don't say it, just take me there. - This is quite a coincidence, don't you think so, Morgan? - The world rises and falls on the strength of coincidence, Buffy. - I mean, I didn't even see that can until I stepped on it. I was just gonna pitch it. You know, Morgan, some power outside myself made me look inside. Oh, I must've cut myself on that rusty old tin can. Do you think I'll get lockjaw, Morgan? - Not right away, Buffy. Hey, Marshall! - Yes, Mr. Charles? - What kind of digging went on over here? - New septic drain field, Mr. Charles. - [Morgan] How long ago? - Oh, expect about three weeks now. - Was Delilah around when the men were digging? - Yes, sir. She oversees everything that's goes on in South Hall, Mr. Charles. She don't miss nothing. - Thank you kindly, Marshall. - Yes, sir. She don't miss a trick. She don't miss a trick, Mr. Charles. - I think I better get a tetanus shot just to be on the safe side. - First you go to my car and pick up my shot gun and a box of shells. Then you get yourself some digging clothes because we got us a lot of digging to do. - What do you want a shotgun for, Morgan? - Digging up papa's horse money is one thing, keeping it is another. (birds chirping) - Where you going, Marshall? - Get the ham for dinner. - Oh, let me. I never been in the smokehouse before. - Don't matter. Mind you don't get too close to them ashes. - Oh, look at all those delicious hams hanging there. Which one should I take down? - Don't make no difference. (door creaking) (menacing music) (somber music) - Morgan, I don't know how much longer I can stand the smell. - Just keep digging. The money's here and we're gonna find it. - I can't keep up with you. - She wouldn't tell me where it was hid. Not even a hint. I'll show Delilah! - Morgan. - Morgan. Gonna throw your back out working so hard, Morgan. - What do you want? - We thought maybe you could use a little help. - Put that down! That's my shovel and nobody's digging here but Buffy and me! Now back off, all of you! Money's here and I'm digging it up! - You're wasting your time, Morgan. There's no money buried here. - Got a better idea where it's hid, Grace? - As far as I'm concerned, papa's horse money merely the stuff of legends. Why don't you calm down before you have a stroke? - I'll show you legends, Grace. I'll show you legends! (crickets chirping) - Would you like one olive or two, Morgan? Does gin paralyze your sense of smell? It paralyzes my sense of smell. (dirt crunching) And it makes me feel good to be alive. To be alive. (somber piano music) (saw buzzing) (cricket chirping) (saw buzzing) - You suppose you could spare the time to help me up to bed? (ominous music) - Buffy? Buffy? (ominous music) Buffy? Where's my sandwich? I'm hungry! (thudding) (eerie music) (creaking) (foreboding music) Buffy! (door creaking) What're you doing in there? - You know. - Why don't you go to the house where it's more comfortable? - You told me not to get out of earshot. - What's the ax for? - I found it inside. Be careful, it's real sharp. I cut my finger on it. - Well I could use it to chop root. Take it back with you. - Where you going? - Down to the well to wash up. Make me another drink while you're at it. - You never did tel me, is it one olive or two? - Buffy, no olives. No olives! I really can't stand the taste of those lousy olives you keep putting in my martinis! - That's a major point of incapability between us because I certainly wouldn't think of drinking a manini without an olive in it. (crickets chirping) We'll be in China before morning. (eerie music) (rustling) Morgan? (suspenseful music) It's so sharp. (thudding) (somber music) - Buffy? Now where she gone? She got the trots or something? My God. (ominous music) (thudding) - [Delilah] Papa! (ominous music) (shovel rustling) (Luddy huffing) (groaning) (eerie music) (somber music) (thudding) - I'm afraid you'll have to fix your own breakfast, Grace. - Did you say something to me? - We'll have to shift for ourselves this morning. Looks as if Marshall may have gone on a little vacation. - Vacation? They took their vacation in July. - Maybe so. But they've packed and they've gone. Anew? Luddy, will you come here, please? We need you. Luddy? - No use. Luddy's sound asleep. From the looks of things, she's had herself a hard night. - You make it your business to check up on everyone around here? - Cousin Grace, you haven't heard the half of it. Where are you going? - To get some air to clear my head. - You want some company? - No. (chuckling) (birds chirping) - Looks like the treasure hunt is over. - Where is Morgan? - Now that's a good question. He's not in his room, his bed hasn't been slept in. The same goes Km, you know' Mum. . Buffy- And they've gone too. - Well, no. Morgan's car is still here. So I expect they're still around. Only I'll quote odds that they didn't find the horse money. - There is no horse money. Delilah's always thrived on these nasty little intrigues. She feels compelled to go on making fools of us right up to the end. - As for Morgan and his girlfriend, I think we could probably turn them up with a little digging. You don't seem too worried about the possible fate of your brother, Grace. - I have long since stopped worrying about anyone else's fate. # Love the little children # All the children of the world I Red and yellow, black and white # They are precious in His sight # Jesus loves the little children of the world (Ellen humming tune) - Mirror, please Ellen. - You're grip is stronger today. - I feel strong. Stronger than I have for weeks. I may yet rise up and walk. One last time. - How long has it been? - Since I walked? Oh, five year... No, five and a half years. I think I'll wear a choke, Ellen. - All right. - And we'll have a brandy. Napoleon brandy. (wheelchair buzzing) - Diamonds? - My pearl and diamond. You know, Elly, anything I have is yours. - Yes, you told me. - Why don't you help yourself while you have the opportunity? - I'm sorry. It'd be like robbing-- - The dead? - I'm sorry. - No, you're the one who's due the apology. I was only trying, in my small way, to make up for the three years that you've lived at my beckon call. - I've lived the way I wanted to. I've been able to help you. - You've been a positive saint. I hope once you're free of me, you'd just spend some of your time learning to be selfish. - Yes, Aunt Delilah. I'll get the brandy. - May I compliment you, Elly? - [Ellen] On what? - You're the only person in this house whose never disappointed me. That is a prodigious accomplishment. Much as I love papa, he was mighty free with his disappointments. Of course, you've always been terrified of me. Yet I sense this is no longer true. I sense momentous changed in you, Elly. At least the tension of change. - Do you? . Elly, would you like to know where the horse money is hidden? - No. - He's ordered you to find out, hasn't he? - No. - There, the beginnings of disappointment. (wheelchair buzzing) - There isn't much light left, Aunt Delilah, if We're going down to the mausoleum. - There's plenty of light. Plenty of time. - I'll get a sweater. You want me to go with you. - He's a weak man, Elly. - He's not weak! He is the strongest man I ever met. - [Delilah] He's a cheat! - It's not cheating. We talk about it. There is a difference between men and women and I accept that difference and it makes our marriage a good marriage without hypocrisy. I know what his weaknesses are but it isn't so important. Not so important where he goes or who he goes to as long as he comes back. - Get rid of him, Elly. - If you'd ever had a man like Richard, even for one night, you'd never be able to say that! (gassing) (ominous music) - Wait, Elly! I Red, yellow, black and white # They a precious in His sight # Jesus loves the little children of the world (somber music) (ominous music) - Papa? Papa? Is it you? It is you. It's so good to see you. I've waited so long, oh don't go. Don't go, papa, please don't go. I've so much to tell you. I've so much, please! Papa! Papa, please don't go! Please, papa, don't go! Please, papa, don't go! (screaming) (menacing music) (wheelchair buzzing) (grandfather clock chiming) (clock ticking) - Hello, the house! Where is everybody? Alonzo?! Delilah?! Anybody?! Grace is requesting the pleasure of your company! (wind howling) Demah? (wind howling) Delilah is up and around. (laughing) Delilah! (water plopping) (giggling) (laughing) (ominous music) Demah? (horse galloping) (ominous music) (menacing music) (somber music) (door creaking) . Please. Stay out of here. - [Ellen] I have something for you, Alonzo. - I don't want to eat. Just leave me alone. - Something Richard sent. - No. - You're in pain. - No. No more. I'm through. I wanna be clean again. - Roll up your sleeve. (ominous music) (groaning) (foreboding music) - How much you give me? - Ayear supply- (menacing music) Have you counted it yet? - Are you kidding? It'll lake two days to count all this. - [Ellen] Suppose you didn't have any trouble finding it. - It's right where it had to be. Papa was using most of it for a pillow. Now I wonder why it took me so long to figure the whole thing out. Stands to reason, Delilah never would've trust anyone but papa with the money. Hey! 600 thousand. Give or take. Aren't you interested? - Smells rotten. It's been buried too long. - This money's in a lot better shape than papa was when I saw him. How's Alonzo? Did he take his medicine like a man? - He was unconscious when I left him. - [Richard] Good. How long does he have? - He should stop breathing in about an hour. - Last chance to run your fingers through the money. I have to pack it up. Good old Luddy's not gonna asleep forever. (ominous music) (eerie music) (laughing) (ominous music) - [Delilah] Papa! - [Richard] How're you feeling? - Same way I always feel. - [Richard] That's good. - [Ellen] Yes, it's very good. - [Richard] I have to leave now. I have to get on with it. (gun cocking) - As long as you come back to me. Nothing else matters. (eerie music) - I like you a lot, Elly. You've been a big help. I'm really sorry I have to do this, Elly! (thudding) (sighing) Luddy! (crickets chirping) Luddy, come out here! (groaning) Help me, Luddy, please! Help me! - I don't want to! I don't want to, I can't! - [Richard] Luddy, for God sake, help me! (ominous music) (whimpering) " Luddy] Where are you? I can't see you. (gasping) - [Richard] That's right, Luddy. You did it again. ' Nd.! It was just lying here! - Oh come on, Luddy! You know what you've done! Fist Jurroe, then Morgan and what's her name, then Grace and poor Ellen. God rest. - Ellen?! What's happened to Ellen?! - Then me. Look at me, Luddy. If you'd come just a little closer, just one inch closer, I'd be dead! Pick up the ax. You look more natural that way. - I haven't killed anybody. - Just you and me now and I'm the soul survivor. Winner take all. Pick up the ax. ' Nd.! . Okay- Doesn't really matter. - [Luddy] What have you done? - You, me, what's the difference? They're all dead. - I thought it was Alonzo. - Wrong, Luddy! Alonzo couldn't have pulled this off. Not many men have what it takes. - You killed Alonzo? - Ellen give him an overdose. He'll stop breathing in a few minutes. Wait a minute, Luddy, I'm not gonna chase you all over this place. Let's get it over with! It's been a long night. (Luddy crying) Don't touch that phone, Luddy. I want Alonzo to die! (suspenseful music) I said come back here, Luddy! Just pick up the ax. All you have to do is pick up the ax and hold it until I blew your head off. (Luddy whimpering) (Luddy gagging) I don't care! Let's just get it over with! You have to die! Damn you, Luddy! Damn you! Give up! (gunshot booming) You're damned, old witch! (gunshot booming) (ominous music) (dramatic music) - Alonzo! - You taught me everything I needed to know, papa. Please, papa. How can I get to you? How? (somber music) (birds chirping) - Well, Luddy? All set to go? - Yes. Where are we going, Alonzo? - I don't know. We'll have to think about that, Luddy. Where would you like to go? Mexico? South America? - New Zealand. (chuckling) - All right. All right. New Zealand it is. Can't stay long, though. Have to get back to our children. - Will we be able to keep the money, Alonzo? - Oh, almost half of it. We'll have some taxes to pay but there will be enough left over for the children. Now why don't you just turn this contraption off and I'll push. - Maybe I better walk. - Oh, no, no, no, no. Doctor's orders. One more day till you get your strength back. You think 25 is too many to start with? - No. Oh no, I don't think that's too many children. (pleasant music) (laughing) ("Jesus Loves The Little Children" instrumental music) (gunshot booming) - Yes, sir. She don't miss a trick. She don't miss a trick, Mr. Charles. (dramatic music) (beat music)
