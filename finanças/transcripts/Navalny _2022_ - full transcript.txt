Rolling. We're rolling, Daniel. OK, we're going, guys? Yeah. OK, Alexei, I want to talk about something that we sort of touched on this morning, and you might hate this, but I really want you to think about it. If you are killed, if this does happen, what message do you leave behind to the Russian people? Oh, come on, Daniel. No. No way! It's like you're making a movie for the case of my death. Like, again, I'm ready to answer your question, but please let it be another movie, movie number two. Like, let's make a thriller out of this movie and, in the case I would be killed, let's make a boring movie of memory. Alexei Navalny is stepping back into another showdown with the Kremlin. What to do with Navalny presents a conundrum for the Kremlin, let him go and risk looking weak, or lock him up, knowing it could turn him into a political martyr. SOME CHEERS. CLAMOURING VOICES. Are you not scared, Alexei? What do you expect in Moscow? CROWD CHANT "NAVALNY". CHEERING AND APPLAUSE. Unexpectedly, Vladimir Putin has a genuine challenger, a handsome 41-year-old lawyer, Alexei Navalny, who has chosen one of the most dangerous occupations in the world - running against the man who controls the Kremlin. More than any other opposition figure in Russia, Alexei Navalny gets ordinary people out to protest. If I want to fight Putin, if I want to be a leader of a country, I have to do something practical about it. Well, I have to kind of organize people. I was banned from everything - television, banned, newspapers, blacklisted, rallies, forbidden. I realised I can do a lot on my own with the support of my wife, Yulia. Just a small group of people I can rely on, zero money, a lot of work, internet, and that's it. His youngest fans have turned to TikTok, which has been crucial in spreading the word. Navalny's posted hundreds of videos about his corruption investigations, and they're wildly popular. The Kremlin hates Navalny so much that they literally refuse to say his name. Our office was raided and they just confiscated everything - everything! They splashed a toxic liquid into my face and my first thought was, "Jesus, I will be kind of a monster until the end of my days." As I became more and more famous guy, I was totally sure that my life became safer and safer because I am a kind of famous guy, and it would be problematic for them just to kill me. And, boy, were you wrong. Yes, I was very wrong. Clapper! So, we went to Siberia to make a nice movie about local corruption. I expected a lot of police. I expected a lot of people who'd try to prevent our filming, confiscate our cameras or just break our cameras or try to beat us. I expected that sort of things and I was very surprised, like, "Why is nobody here?" "Why is there kind of..." I even have this strange feeling like, like a lack of respect. Like, seriously? I'm here and where is my police? He whole trip was the smoothest trip I ever had in the regions. I am a kind of slave of Thursdays, because on Thursday I have my online YouTube show. And then weekend, I can spend with my family before another trip to another region. I was going home and then I died. Passengers on his flight from Siberia heard Alexei Navalny cry out in agony. Other passengers filming just after the plane makes an emergency landing in Siberia. Navalny was then rushed to the hospital where he was put on a ventilator. His spokeswoman saying Navalny was poisoned. His wife raced to be by his side. We've come to the conclusion that, judging by the fact that there were no poisons found in his blood or other biological materials, he has a metabolic disorder, lowering of blood sugar levels to be specific. We're hearing state agencies here backed by the Kremlin suggesting that hallucinogenic drugs may be involved but not poisoning. This morning an air ambulance from a German charity landed. We have to make sure his condition is completely stable. We cannot transfer him in this state even if his family have consented to it. The moment when I heard the news that Navalny was poisoned, my first thought was can this be the Kremlin? Would they be so dumb to try and kill an opposition figure? The main opposition figure? I was sceptical. I thought, maybe it's one of the many oligarchs on whose feed is... Either it's a state ordered attack or it is somebody who is trying to assassinate opposition figures in order to at least Putin. The closest anyone has come to tracing a poisoning to Vladimir Putin. The 2018 attack in Salisbury, England. A defiant Kremlin insisting again that he had nothing to do with the brazen assassination attempt of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. Skripal was poisoned by the military grade nerve agent Novichok. The insidiousness of Novichok is that it actually starts switching off your nerve connectors in your body one by one. If it's dosed properly, it will just turn you off as a body. But then within hours any trace of it will disappear. So it was always, forever look like it was a natural death. And this is why it appears to be the preferred form of killing for people's whose death will be in the public scrutiny, such as Navalny. There was a lot of pressure for us to start investigating. Our media department in Russia who reached out to us and said, "can you help?" We looked at them and we thought there's no hope in hell that we can investigate investigate a crime that happened in Russia, in the remote corners of Siberia, sitting here comfortably in Europe. We didn't even try in the beginning. Alexei Navalny arrives at this hospital in Berlin with his wife Yulia. A spokesperson tweeted: "The struggle for Alexei's life and health is just beginning. Here at the hospital, both inside and out, he'll be watched." To have your dad, an opposition leader, being poisoned by we don't know what, we don't know how, we don't know when, and just be in a random hospital. It was just... It was surreal. It was literally like a book. Hello. The doctors assured they can't say anything about his brain to which extent he will recover even if they manage to wake him up. Many millions of Navalny supporters are trying to out how to help. We in Berlin are a small team. We had to dive into actually getting things done. We all were very sceptical about investigating Alexei's poisoning. As opposed to previous cases, this poisoning took place on the Russian soil, so no one is going to share security footage with us. They're not going to have fancy videos from the airport where the poisoners fly in and out. And as much as it hurts to admit, while Putin is in power we'll never find out the truth. Yulia, how is your husband this morning? It was so crazy, like it's Putin's signature poison. We were actually so shocked. So he didn't just decide to murder him, but to poison. And not just to poison, but exactly Novichok. This was, like, really, like, leaving his signature on the crime scene. When you come into the room of a comatose patient, you are starting to just tell him the news. Telling him his story. Alexei, don't worry. You were poisoned. There was a murder attempt. Putin tried to kill you with Novichok. And he opened his, like, blue eyes wide and looked at me and said, very clear... Oh, come on. Poisoned? I don't believe it. It's like, he's back. This is Alexei. Putin's supposed to be, like, not so stupid to use this Novichok. His wording. His expletive. His indignation. If you want to kill someone, just shoot him. Jesus Christ. Like, real Alexei. It's impossible to believe it. It's kind of stupid the whole idea of poisoning with a chemical weapon, what the lock? This is why this is so smart, because even reasonable people they refuse to believe like, what? Come on, poisoned? Seriously? Traditional journalism implies you meeting with a source and that source telling you a story. In today's world of fake news, we don't trust sources. Because we don't trust humans. We trust data. Bellingcat is an organisation of digital nerds most of us with almost a little bit of autistic-like fascination with numbers. Every time you use your email, you make a phone call, you make a doctor's appointment, take a plane or a train, any time you used the ATM. Every time you actually look at the screen of your phone. That leaves a trace. In a place like Russia, imagine the person who works at the travel agency that has access to the flight manifests. They're getting like, what, $25 a day as a salary, and then for another $25 they would be able to sell that flight manifest to anybody who asks for it, just because it'll double their income for the day. This is a whole industry. Data brokers are on the dark web. You negotiate the price and within a few minutes they say, "Yep, I can get that data for you by tomorrow." And then you have to send bitcoin. Now, Bellingcat can't pay for that data because it's a foundation, so I have to pay for that data myself. Over the last five years of me working on data journalism, I would say I've spent $150,000. My wife has no idea about this. My wife suspects I've probably spent $2-3,000. If she knew the real quantum, she wouldn't be my wife. But she's gonna watch the movie. She's not watching this movie. Our expectation was once he's released from intensive care, he will have a desire to go to Russia immediately. To our great relief, he told me: "I better spend several months here." "I want to go back to Russia strong and fully recovered." For the longest time, I wasn't sure what to make of Navalny. I always wondered wondered how much of an independent figure he is or is he one of the many fake opposition figure created by the Kremlin. I've criticised him on Twitter. I mean, he was known for having flirted with the extreme right in the early days of his career. He walked side by side with some pretty nasty nationalists and racists. Had he moved beyond that? Had he actually become a reverse dark knight? Alexei Navalny! Within all my career, I've been asked the same 15 questions all the time. Are you afraid? Are you working for Kremlin? What is your family doing? You have a responsibility for your family. If it is a foreign journalist, they are asking about the international. And every one of them, Jesus Christ, just watch previous interviews. Hold on. Were there not a couple of Sieg Heil-ers at that thing? Sorry? Were there not a couple of Nazi guys at that march? Certainly a Sieg Heil-ers are a different category that you would not want to associate with or march beside. Well, in the normal world, in the normal, political system, of course, I would never be within the same political party with them. But we are creating coalition, broader coalition to fight their regime. Just to achieve the situation where everyone can participate in election. A lot of politicians woulf even be uncomfortable to be associating or being in the same photograph as one of these guys. You're comfortable with that? I'm OK with that and I consider it's my political superpower, I can talk to everyone. Anyway, well, they are citizen of Russian Federation and if I want to fight Putin if I want to be a leader of a country I cannot just ignore the huge part of it. There are a lot of people who call themselves nationalists. OK, let's discuss it. We're living in a country where they are poisoning a politician and killing people. And arresting people for nothing. Of course, I am totally fine to sit with a guy whose rally looks kind of not very good for me. The Russian media didn't find anything, and German investigators didn't have the jurisdiction. So we realized, there's nobody who's actually going to actively investigate this. Unless we jump into this. We knew that the poison was Novichok and Novichok we had proven in the previous investigation was only manufactured in this facility called the Signal Institute. The Signal Institute in Moscow works under the guise of a RNB center that develops advanced forms of sports, nutrition drinks. That's the legend. Yet, they employ for this work 12 scientists whose only experience and background is in chemical weapons. Our hypothesis - this is the entity that actually provides the poison for the killers who travel around the world poisoning people with Novichok. So what we did was bought from the Russian black market the phone records for the head of the Signal Institute. We looked at numbers that only appear just before the poisoning of Navalny and those were suspicious. But, once we have a suspicious number, you go through a number of Russian apps that allow you to see how that phone number is listed in other people's phonebooks. So, for example, I put in my number and it will show up as Christo the journalist from Bellingcat, because somebody would have put my name into their phonebook and that description would have been shared into this app. First number I looked up showed up as Alexei, doctor from FSB. Well, that was interesting. But that was not enough. We couldn't place a real person behind this name. Then, I would look up if this number showed up in any car registration databases. And we found an actual Alexei Alexandro who owns a car and this number was listed for contacting this person. So then you have a real person with a birthday. Then, you look up his passport file, you see his face. You repeat that many times with the other suspicious numbers, and then you have a shortlist of interesting people. And these became our prime suspects. Now, we knew when Navalny had travelled to Siberia. We had the actual passenger manifests of six different flights that had flown into Novosibirsk where Navalny flew from Moscow on the day before, during, and after the day in which he arrived there. So, we needed to see if any of those suspicious people travelled to Siberia at the time of the poisoning, and we found an overlap. We found a nest of wasps we didn't know existed. It's a domestic assassination machine on an industrial scale. I was absolutely shocked that this was so fast and the whole plot disentangled so quickly, so I just reached out by Twitter and said "Alexei, I think we may have found who poisoned you." After I went out of the hospital, I decided to move into Black Forest and live in some small village. You can just walk for hours and not meet any person at all. These are my German friends, actually the little pony is my friend and donkey is Yulia's friend. And this is the routine of our walk. Come here, my little pony. Isn't he sweet? Better than your donkey. Everybody likes the small pony, it's like usual. You're scaring him. Go away. Aw, you poor guy. Donkey, hi. Of course, you like me. Come on, my mighty horse. Come here. More carrot. You'll grow big. They are cute, but they are not very smart. So, they decided for their fence not to provide electricity. Yulia want an apple and asked me to take it. But it's Germany, so it's someone's apple. And there is a police over there. I'll come there when it will be dark. And no police. So, you're a Russian criminal who arrived to Germany? No, it's OK. It belongs to I don't know. How do you know? Because it's open place. This is a very Russian style, you know, of thinking about property, like it belongs to everyone, because it's an open place. Just come and get it. The story of this guy who lives in Vienna but is Bulgarian but works in Russia and that he has all of his own money and he spends it all on investigations in Russian crimes. He just sounded too suspicious. Too good to be true. Too capable? He sounded a bit, you know, made up. Are you confident that he is not MI6 or CIA? I'm pretty confident. I wouldn't say I rule it out, but I'm pretty confident that he's not. I was suspicious about this guy from Twitter. I just saw his old laptop and all these tables with data. Turns out, and I was very surprised that the whole thing about Bellingcat is just one smart guy, no CIA involved, no MI6. He's just a nice and very kind Bulgarian nerd with a laptop. Major tell me if you recognise any of the people in the photographs. Getting through emotionally to Alexei was a piece of cake. Took literally an hour. Getting through to Maria took much longer. She was very tough. She never smiled. She was the one vetting me, whether I am a spy or not. But we needed information that only his team would be privy to. So we found a very workable arrangement which was completely ethical and acceptable to us. We agreed that Maria Pevchikh would be working as part of our team and she would not be sharing with Alexei all of the information in real time so that we wouldn't be influenced by the bias of the victim. When we discovered this clandestine operation, it was so shocking that even to us it looked unbelievable. I mean, come on, the government is paying a whole team of 20 plus people whose only job is to poison other Russians? That sounds improbable. So we needed other journalists to look at it. I would like to share the limelight with some global media so that is validated by more than just us. So, CNN and Spiegal are fine with you? Yeah. Absolutely. That means we need to film exactly like a week from now, maybe like... We had a nightmare trying to get everybody to stick to the same time. It's all timed for a simultaneous release. All the media are going to drop the bombshell simultaneously. It's a huge debate as to whether this was intended to incapacitate or kill. I would say kill, 100% kill. If, for example, Navalny had laundry returned to him while he was staying at the Tomsk Hotel the afternoon before he left, would that be a point of access? It's definitely a possibility. The question is how well you can dose the agent that way. You put, let's say 10 times the deadly dose on the clothing. You must be sure, however, that you get at least one lethal dose into the body. Tomorrow we'll set up a phone with fake ID. So if we can call them through this number we can try to prank them. Yes, of course. Navalny will call personally these boys one by one and we will record this. Hi, this is Navalny. You may remember me from trying to kill me. Is it your contention that Vladimir Putin must have been aware of this? Of course, 100% it could have not happened without. Who's the most stupid? Most stupid of them? Well, definitely these are Spetsnaz guys with no real training. I think it makes sense to try to prank stupid guys and maybe these non-military guys. When you were a kid, did you have any political awareness? Was it a political family? Did your family talk about politics? Yes, my family talks about politics all the time and it was very, They start talk much more after Chernobyl disaster because my father and his family, they are from Chernobyl, from the small village two kilometres away. And, I would say, ten kilometers away from the nuclear station. Everyone knows that there was an explosion of a nuclear station, but news keeping silence and so all this nuclear and radioactive dust was on these fields and they were forced to go and plant potatoes just to prevent rumours, just to explain population that everything is fine. Everything is OK! Go and work in the fields! And, with the first appearance of Putin on the screen, I just felt it. I have this same feeling like I am watching TV and I am watching political leader and he's looking into my eyes and lying to me. This is the biggest challenge for me. I tried to practice juggling about a month and because of coordination and balancing video, because you need some balancing here, I'm very bad in it. I think he wants to make sure this hits home in Russian media. I mean, I think that's based on if he does it. So, we're not being journalists reporting about some politician, but we're reporting about a politician who has his own YouTube show with over 13 million followers and considers himself half a journalist. If That's a very unusual situation that doesn't make things easier. Mum, is this yours? no, you have water. Hold my beer while I make a TikTok. No, no, no. Just the second one you just are filming me and I must be horizontal. MUSIC: How Bizarre. Hold on. Again. You should remove second one. Oh, we can do that? Yes, of course. This is, you know... I don't know, I don't know how to do that. You know that Christo call it Moscow4. Uh, you know what is Moscow4? No. What is that? Well, their email of their very top guy from intelligence was hacked several times and his first password was Moscow1 and they hacked him so second his password was Moscow2 and they hacked him as well. And so well the third time, he had passcode Moscow3. And just guess what was his fourth password? So Moscow4 is the explanation of the stupidity of the system. Dasha, could you take my phone and be in the kitchen and pretend you're General Bogdanov. OK. Super. Super. Tomorrow we will make these calls. Honestly, I don't think it will work because FSB guys. They supposed to be resistant to pranks. But Moscow4, Moscow4. Ah, yes, and then we arrange to push the button and everything will be published exactly at 12. And also, I will publish my TikTok I recorded today. And we'll have a kind of 15 minutes of shame with it. OK, see you tomorrow! Hello. Now I totally feel like I am a undercover agent with the wired up. Are you not nervous? Sorry? Are you nervous? No. Please, come on. A little bit. He hung up. Oh, my God, you ruined their day. Not just today, I guess. He hung up. Maybe try the prank way? OK. That was a freaking scared guy. He recognised your voice? Yep, yep. Mikhail's not stupid. I really think a scientist might talk to you. 1% chance. OK. Let's, let's try to reach some scientists. How could you do this? Yes, yes, yes. So, now we know everything like Moscow4. Oh my locking god. Actually, he's not a muscle. He's a chemist. He's a chemist? Yes. He spilled the whole story. This is unbelievable. Poor guy. They will kill him. They will kill him, literally. I think you'll be president, seriously, after this. They will definitely kill him. Poor Kudryavtsev. Poor Kudryavtsev, yes. He's a dead man. Let's offer him to defect. Let's arrange for him the whole thing. Seriously. Cos I think that's a humanitarian thing to do. He will be in a ditch by tomorrow. They'll just kill him. No, no, no. They will kill him. OK, well Spiegel has been begging me to call them since the morning Can I tell them this already? Confidentially? Let's just decide. Are we going to publish this conversation? Yeah. Because I think we should wait for A... Putin's press conference, at the very least. Sorry? To Putin's press conference, at the very least. It is on Wednesday, or Thursday? Thursday. Seventeenth. Christo, before pushing this button, I want to say that was amazing job. Thank you everyone for your contribution, guys. Yeah! High-five. Now, an exclusive investigation can reveal a top secret mission. An elite team of operatives have been tracking Navalny's every move for more than three years. Oh, thank you so much. It's an honour for me to be on such a big television of Spain and I'm very pleased you are paying attention to this situation. So, thank you very much. This scheme, which looks like it's from the movies, but in this particular case it's a real scheme, with real people, Putin on the very top. In mid-August, Navalny and his team traveled to Siberia. At least five members of the FSB unit make the same journey on different flights. Thank you very much. Back in Tomsk there was a surge in communications among the FSB unit and their bosses. If it was expected that Navalny would die on the flight, they were now scrambling to deal with a very different situation. We enter a rundown apartment building on the outskirts of Moscow where operative Oleg Tayakin lives. My name is Clarissa Ward and I'm with CNN. Can I ask you a couple of questions? So, you've said that you want to go back to Russia? You're aware of the risks of going back? Definitely. Why do you want to go back? I don't want this, you know, group of killers exist in Russia. I don't want Putin being president. I don't want him being tsar. So I want to go back and try to change it. So, this is fantastic piece. He opened his mouth to American songs. On TikTok. They are lying. This is crazy stuff, huh. Crazy, funny stuff like, who's he? But think about it, they're talking about this all the time. They talk about you. This is very funny. But the main point is they have a big problem otherwise they would not launch it. Right, right. They allowed the state number one channel that has never mentioned his name to only talk about him now. Yes, you're absolutely right. This is a main point. It's not affordable for them to keep silence. No, no. She plays chess better than all others in our family. Better than everyone in our family and because of this series Queen's Gambit, she's demanding that everyone should play chess. But nobody is playing. That is why I'm playing with the phone. Well, I definitely prefer Call of Duty. I definitely prefer chess. I prefer shopping. Ready for a 12-hour flight. We have to sit down for good luck. Starting from 13 years old, I would think about, what would I do if my dad was killed? Whenever I had, like, the talk, it's not anything you can sit at the table and discuss. So, it's nice for you for you, Dasha, to see the snow, so much snow before you go to LA, right? There is snow in California. There was a point a year ago, where my dad was almost not there for my high school graduation. He was in jail once again and, like, the whole day I was just thinking about how my dad would've been... I'm sorry. My dad would've been proud to see me walk on the stage and get my certificate. And he wouldn't get that option, because he was in jail for doing the right thing. I know that my dad misses Russia, even though it's scary to go back. And if he didn't go back, I would say, you need to go back and fight. It's something worth fighting for. His favourite, favourite answer for everything is CIA. Great, great, great, great, great. Because this is just amazing pass to us. Now, we can uphold, because he said, well, if we want to poison him, of course, we would have poisoned him. So, just, we will, I mean, the whole argumentation we will smash it. I'm just very curious how people will react to it, whether they will be as astonished as we are, hopefully. Because nothing like that's ever happened to anyone. OK, The Insider is up. Oh, that's totally unbelievable. I would never believe it if I wasn't part of it. 300. 300,000 views for 20 minutes. One hour later. 1 million views. The poisoning of dissident Alexei Navalny has taken an even more bizarre turn. If this was a Hollywood movie you would say it was over the top, but this is not. This is real and boy, does this conversation punch a giant hole in the Kremlin's narrative. Surely, this is hugely embarrassing for the Kremlin and for the FSB. Oh, absolutely. It's embarrassing for Mr Kudryavstev, it's embarrassing for the FSB. It's embarrassing for the Kremlin. The FSB has said that the video of the conversation posted on Navalny's YouTube channel was fake and that the phone call was a provocation aimed at discrediting the agency. Navalny is suffering from delusion of persecution. Otherwise, there's a Freudian fixation on his own crotch area, which is probably how all of this should probably be treated. How is President Navalny different than President Putin? Well, my major task as a president just to prevent, you know, this damn circle of really over-established authoritarian regime. In authoritarian country, you either with an authoritarian leader or against an authoritarian leader. So, we are in more primitive politics, like human rights, freedom of speech, fair election. The tax money is supposed to belong to the local communities and, in Russia, everything is decided in Moscow. So, being a president just having this, you know, big pie of my power and I will cut it for the future of Russia. I apologise, I am sorry for the record that five minutes ago I told Daniel to get the lock out of here with his camera so, I apologise for that, because well, well everything is like, everything is happening in the last ten minutes and I have to make like a millions of emails. And... Leonid have a seat. Maria have a seat. You make me nervous because you're standing over me, sorry. Sorry, I have to sit. It's a Russian superstition, but it's important. Dear citizens, please leave the area. Only ticked passengers allowed. Since Navalny decided to come back, we have to greet him because he is now the symbol of Russia's freedom. In a few minutes, we will begin our final descent. Alexei, a comment please. Alexei will not be making any comments now. Hello, may I take a selfie? The anti-why police showed up and are just arresting everybody, including journalists live on the air. This is crazy. Jesus. I've never seen anything like this. There's no way they're not going to arrest him. I don't think they will let him come close to the front. I think they're going to yank him away before anybody else is let off the plane. This is the plane and this is Moscow. And this is the plane, and this is Moscow. They realised it's not possible to control the crowd and they chicked out. White Max Chanting. CHANTING. Alexei, if you are arrested and thrown in prison or the unthinkable happens and you're killed, what message do you leave behind to the Russian people? My message, for the situation that I am killed, is very simple - not give up. Do me a favour, answer this one in Russian.
