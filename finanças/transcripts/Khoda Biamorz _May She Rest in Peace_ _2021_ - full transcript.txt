Alo Marshid This is Golbarg. Here, that's all I have. -No no no. don't! Thanks! I'll be here for awhile. Just wasted our time. Hey Ahad.. How's it going? They've sent Auntie to the cemetery's morgue. Yeah How am I supposed to know? Her doctor already signed the death certificate. I'll see you there at the cemetery, in the chamber. Don't be late, ok? Alright, see you later. How's Ahad getting there? - By subway. But it's an hour walk from the station to the chamber. There are cemetery cabs right outside of the station. And then.. as they say. He acted like.. What should we do now? - Well, they're having lunch. So we should wait till they finish their lunch? We're waiting for Ahad anyway. Hello. - Hi pal. It seems like nobody's set foot in here for decades. No? Do you live abroad? - Abroad? No. Why? What are you doing? So why did you come to visit your family only now? But these are not my family. Where are you going? Where's the block 209? It's 500 meter that way, after the children's block. I can't believe this! They're still in there not even bothering about us. They're having a picnic. I don't know where the hell Ahad is. Saba, go say something to them. - No I won't! You're so useless, always glued to your phone. Excuse me gentlemen! But a little respect won't hurt! You've been here for an hour like you're having a picnic. Where are your manners? Our family is buried here. Reserved Hi there! How's it going? No, not at all! I've never dealt with such an idiot client! I keep telling him.. ..that they don't have the stones he wanted for the facade anymore. He just doesn't listen! He's one of those types that a couple of years ago.. ..would've had two marble lions at the entrance. - Morad gave the key to strangers. I’ve no idea what's going on here. What the hell Ahad! - I'll call you later. Have you lost your mind? - I'm just trying my eternal bed! Get up now! Get up you idiot! Mr. Morad was supposed to take care of this place, But he hasn't done anything. What was your name again? - Bagheri. No, your first name. - Hassan. Hassan dear, take this money and do me a favor Get some nice flowers and plants - Okay Keep the change for yourself. - Mom, why did you send that poor guy We could've just driven there. Then take the car and go with him! Yes, thank you, I appreciate it. My brother and I are her only family here. Correct. No, she did not have any children. Correct. Thank you very much! I will contact you later. They've brought Auntie to the morgue. We have to be there in 20 minutes. Thank you so much Hassan! - You're welcome Ma'am. Saba help him. - Let me take these. Oops! be careful. Put the rest in that corner. Have you brought anything to clean the chamber? Yes Ma'am. You bought such beautiful flowers. Excuse me Sir, which way is the morgue? - First you should go to the cemetery office. It's behind that building. He says we should go to the cemetery office. Oh it's so hot today! We went to see Auntie. I think Golbarg had put make up on her. - Do they let her have makeup on? They'll remove it before the burial. Who's Golbarg? - Her caregiver. Don't you even know this? What will happen to her? - How should I know? She'll probably go back to her town. Although, she'll be there till the end of the funeral. Besides, there are tons of jobs for a nurse like her? Hassan dear, do you know Mr Morad? Doesn't he work here anymore? - Morad's dead. What? Morad died? - Yes Ma'am. When? I don't know, 2 months, 3 months, or 4 months ago. I was here 3 months ago. He was all fine and healthy. How did he die? - His heart stopped. Shame! They buried him there in the new blocks. Mahshid, I don't have any cash on me. Can you give me some? Thank you. Well done Hassan! - Thank you! Sorry it's not much. - Thank you very much Sir! You worked very hard today. You can leave now. Thank you. Thank you very much for your hard work Hassan. So, we have one free spot next to Dad's grave. And there's one other spot next to Shahram's. Next to Shahram is my plot and the one next to Dad was Mom's. Well, Grandma obviously doesn't need it anymore. Mansour bought it for him and Fariba. He has turned it into a double plot. - Why did nobody tell me? You know Mom never wanted to be buried here. She herself sold her grave when she was still alive. Let's just put her in my plot then. - So, that our family’s only son.. ..will not be buried here. Besides, who's gonna pay for it? What difference does it make? It's ours. So, we just give away our graves and nobody else spends a penny. Besides, our father wanted his only son to be buried by his side. Listen, we have to spend a fortune to buy a grave anywhere else. Which one of these are double depth plots? That one is Tooraj's grave, and Ferri lies on top of him. Here, Vakili's. - No. That's Azar's spot. Auntie Azar won't even come for the funeral. So what? - So how'd she ever find out? Vakili's been dead for a long time. We can bury Auntie in his place. Vakili hasn't been dead for that long! Mom! I was in second grade when he died. She's right! Vakili's been dead for 25 years! Legally, 30 years should pass to replace it. Say 5 years. Azar will kill us! This is their plot. We can't just take it from them. I don't know anymore. Then, we don't have any place for Auntie Parvin. We can put her next to Mom. - Say again? We bury Auntie next to Mom. - That area is too expensive. Is anything available up there? - Yes, we can find something. How much are they? - From 80 to 200 million Toman. Wow! How much? 80 million? - It depends on its location Madam. My goodness! What's up? This asshole has sued us. He hasn't even paid us since last year. No, the contractor has also told him about the stones. - Want a grave? I'll give you a good price. Listen, legally he can sue us. His claim is that we took too long or something. Yeah So, what's the deal? - I don't know. Listen Ahad, I really prefer to put Auntie next to Mom. There are some available graves up there, right? - These are all either occupied or have owners. There are some sellers among them. Since the prices have gone up.. .. they replace the older graves with triple depth plots. You can have my number for now. Anyway, this area's too expensive. Azar can also chip in. She was her aunt too. Look, I'd like to put her next to Mom too. But you and I will end up paying for the whole thing. And you know Azar never does anyone a favor But this place is so humiliating! What will people say? Those looked a bit better. How much are those? From 3 to 6 million Toman. They're all triple depth. I won't let our aunt to be buried here. Let me call Azar. This area will rapidly get filled. Then everybody will want to be buried here. Ahad, you owe Azar money? - Yeah, why? You made me humiliate myself in front of her. Why did you borrow money from her? - I'll tell you later. What are we supposed to do now? Let's just put her in my grave. Dad will actually enjoy it. You cut it out now! Everything's just a joke to you. You can either call or go online to reserve one of these. They each cost 1.5 million Toman. They are all triple depth plots. If you'd rather not buy a plot, you can bury her here for free. The cemetery will then bury other people on top of her.
