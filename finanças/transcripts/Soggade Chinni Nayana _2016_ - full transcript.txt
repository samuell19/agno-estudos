Sita, don't feel shy, tell me, are you going to bless me with a grandson… no, no, its not that, sita needs divorce it seems, what sita needs, don't you need divorce, we have come here to inform aunt and file for divorce… What do you mean I want a divorce? - But you said it first, no? - So what? You agreed no? But it was you idea, no? My idea? It was your idea too. Both of you, stop it, Ramu, have you gone mad? No no no, then why do you need divorce, she will always talk sarcastically, sathya… she will mistake me if I am home or stay in hospital, she will ask me to come home if I am working and if I am home, she will ask me to take her out, She has everything at home, you know? What else she needs sathya… there is everything in home, except him, we have all the costliest things, but nothing has love in them, there is no need for him to do great things for the sake of it, but it will be so nice if he can do some small things for my satisfaction, all I need is the love which he has for me, a compliment when I give him a coffee, and a kiss before he leaves to office, and a small message sometime during the day asking me about my lunch… I am one among the top five doctors in U.S.A, its all about hospital, labs, research… hectic work 24/7. At times I myself forget lunch and what message can I text her…. I have been observing since marriage, he has never said any good things even a single day in these three years regarding my attire and never complimented me even for my smile even I am a human, I am a woman, who else can I go and ask to talk to me except for my husband… its not that sita…I am fed up of him, do you know how I celebrated my birthday this year… Ramu, what time did you come last night?, it was almost 1 by the time I came sita… OK, see you. Ramu, yes, today is my birthday… Oh yesterday was world cancer day, next day is your birthday. Happy birthday. Can you take a leave today. No sita, got an important case… OK… We'll go to the temple in the evening OK? Don't miss it. I have been asking this for 3 years, Ramu… Yeah I'll come early. Sathyamma, wait, wait, I will tell you what happened to me that day… Ramu, I have called you many times, I forgot the phone. Its the same work which you have everyday… Everyday new patients with new problems. You are always like this, work, work, work, don't you have anything else to do in life, what will you do by earning so much…. Work is not about earning sita, As a doctor, it's my responsibility. Their lives are in my hands… even my life is in your hands Ramu, do you know how lonely I have been feeling for the past 3 years… if you feel so lonely, then do some job, it will be a good time pass… loneliness is not in house Ramu, its in the heart… if we don't have a person to share then whats the use of this relation, marriage and life… I don't know what your words mean. They're completely over my top. You don't need to bother understanding. It's all a waste. It'll be right to split up. You will never understand me. You will never understand me. OK Let's part ways. Let's do it. Lets take divorce, OK, let's take it, need to go home and inform this to sathyamma… why do you need divorce for such a small thing… aunty, I will tell you something, as a woman I hope you understand me, my way of leading life with Ramu is similar to how you have been leading your life without uncle… I don't understand this at all. I will tell you what you have to do, go inside… do you know what is happening? Are you seeing it? Just because he looks like you, I didn't wanted him to grow like you, I have bought him up in the safe guards of my eyes, I nurtured him, bought him up without any connection to your life, you always had those silly smile on your face and made girls rotate around you and even you chased them, where ever you are? Just meet me once, I will kill you.. Where will you stay? For all the pain which you have given me, you should be in hell… my age will be some lakh years, some thousand millions of people have come here, but for the first time I am seeing a flirt like this, he has got that flirty nature sir, and here you have framed a rule of punishing a person with girls who has flirted with girls, what can we do for that..sir… sweety you hip seems to be get slimmer day by day... I think its gonna disappear after some days.. Illi baby, from tomorrow on wear black goggles and come..why? Dont ask why, your looks are piercing my body…oh god. Because you dint yesterday I didnt felt like eating, do you know that… Mr.bangarraju, what? You have been flirting with all the women here, thats why new girls have been sent here, now it will be different thing for you… - You all have cheated me.. - We have? Ddnt' you say that Ramba, Urvasi and Menaka stay in heaven and wont come here, then how come they have come… sir has swept them off their feet with just one word… Get lost... get lost..you get away…oh no, babes, wait, wait... we all are one, first shake your hands, shake hands, thats nice… are you observing sir, how he has spun his magic on them, he is not a regular man, he is cupid… come sir, you have arrived at the right time, do you know what sweety said…who is sweety? Oh my, whats that name? Its a nick name, I have named her…you have done a great thing, from the time you have come here, I have been replacing them and you have been changing them, why do you want to romance with them, against the law of nature… yama, look at them from my perspective, you will get to know their beauty, also beauty doesn't lie in appearance yamaraja, it lies within, what do you say ladies? Yes… what is that smile? I will get angry, don't laugh, don't laugh, bangarraju don't laugh…. Can you hear anything…nothing sir… you naughty, you are lying… ya, heard it yamaraja…yamaraja, kindly send my husband here once, will break his legs and send him back…. She is asking you to come, would you like to go, why to go such a far distance now, don't you love her? Of course I love her a lot, but scared that she will scold me… she is such a sacred woman, has requested me to send you down and to send you is my duty, you are sending me forcibly, if I wont return back then you might fall in trouble, I am not a kid bangarraju, I am yama, now itself I am deciding the time, on the next mahasivarati day, before the sun sets, where ever you are, what ever you might be doing, I will get you back with my weapon… wont these girls get worried if its for such a long time, they wont, I am telling you to go, go..if I go then sathya will get scared that I have come as a ghost..don't worry, you will be visible and audible to her, its my blessing to you, go, come on move on, bye darlings, bye, don't worry, I will come as soon as possible… sir, you have just said that you havent seen a person like that in a million years, at the same time even I havent seen a person been sent to earth and that too the reason being his wife, can I know the inner meaning of this my lord… this has been decided by god, thats the reason why his wife has called him too, hence he has been sent to finish a half competed work which is of godly means, this is the order of our supreme god.. Hey sathya, its me, why are you scared.. Bangarraju…yes I am bagarraju… bangaraju, is it you? Yes, its me…. How come you remembered me after these many years, you have totally forgotten me…. Dont say like that, how can I forget you.. Then why didnt you call me all these years, had you appeared if I called you, long back, how can I not come if you call me, even now I had a big tiff with yama, then I told him to do what ever he has to get me here and that's why I've come for you. Is that right? Yes sathya… bagarraju, what sir.. Why did you say her like that… wives should be told things in that manner only yamaraja, they will melt easily with such words… you are impossible man… sathyamma, you still look the same, haven’t changed even a bit, even this side you haven’t changed a bit.. Please stop it dear, sathyamma, what is this? Its a mark against evil… why do I need any marks at this age? What age are you talking about, sathya, you look exactly the way you were at the time of our marriage, that just made me recollect our first night, even the room hasn’t changed a bit, why did you put the key chain here? Take it and put that near your navel, what do I do with that keychain at this age… look, I will get angry if you once again talk about age, come on… move a sari a bit aside, a bit more, a bit more I said, oh my, put that keychain near your navel what the heck do you know how I feel when you feel shy? What do you feel? Heart skips a beat, feel like being with you forever. So, now tell me why were you scolding me so badly. Do you know why ramu and sita have come here?, who are they? Our son and daughter in law, we have a son! The moment I got to know it, you left me forever, where is he?, downstairs, in his room, bangarraju… daughter-in-law, looks so traditional and nice, they are asking us to stay together in this room as they they don't have any other room in such a big house, won’t a husband and wife stay in one room, will we stay united if they keep us in one room, we have come here for divorce, divorce! Sathya, they are talking about divorce, thats what I am trying to say you, its all because of you, this is not fair, why would you scold me if they wanna take divorce, shouldn’t I scold! You used to romance with all the girls who looked pretty, enough of your blushes, the priest said that his horoscope is same as yours and he will definitely grow up to become like you, so to make sure that he doesn’t become like you.. I have brought him up very carefully, carefully means! What game shall we play now, how can you play with girls, get lost, go, see ramu, you shouldn’t play with girls, why mom? If you play with girls or talk to them then goddess kalikadevi will chop our tongue, OK mom, will never play with them again.. There’s a big forest and in that there is a tiger and a lion… what happened? What if she comes? I can’t talk in their presence, why did you come? Said that you will give butter to mom, I have kept it there, go and take, OK aunty, you say, there is huge elephant and, again what happened? She is looking at me from behind, how do you know? I can easily know if a girl looks at me, you are my lovely son… master, what should I make him learn so that he will be engaged in books most of the time, if he has to become a doctor then he has to read for 24hours in a day and even after that also, he has to read for the rest of his life, they won’t have any other wishes, then let's make our ramu a doctor, what ramu? I will become what ever you want me to, you are such a lovely kid… I have brought him up with so much of care, its not called care, then, its like harrasment.. I can’t see his life getting spoiled like this, why are you laughing, silly woman, why are you crying for such a silly thing, I have come, will settle everything.. Look here, look here, yama! What bangarraju? Can’t I touch my wife, what do you think bangarraju, the fact that she can see you itself is a big blessing, to touch her is highly impossible, I only have permission regarding my visibility, I can’t touch you it seems, kindly stop crying, I am unable to see your tears, madam don't worry, except you no one can hear me nor see me, hi baby, how are you? Whats the matter? Lakshmi madam has sent you some milk, keep there and go, OK madam Mr.Koteswarrao said that if a person dies then four people will carry him, but if a person does a mistake then entire village will cary him, he is an intellect, what ever he says is so true, sathya, chalapai brother is still the same, sathya do you remember those romantic moments, you remember only that stuff, hey, you stop, stop, my dear stop, hey hold him, isn’t she saraswati? How come she became so fat? Aunty, what are you doing here? Just like that, shall I get you a nice filter coffee, get me, I will drink, no, no, orelse shall I get you horlicks, I will drink, get it, no, no, its women horlicks, no, no… if needed I will call you, go, OK, but you should ask me if needed…OK… go and do something about their issue I feel ashamed to say you my son, yama, what bangarraju? You have sent me here saying that my wife called me, if I don't unite them, she will kill me, tell me what I should do? Go into your son body and unite them, into my son’s body! How is that possible, your son’s is also the same horoscope as yours, this sounds interesting, what should I do after entering into him, by default you are a big flirt, should I tell you in particular what to do, spell some magic, turn on their desire, leave it, I will take care He might have come to say sorry…. Now no one can stop him, sathyamma, very soon we shall be blessed with a grandson… what happened? Everything will happen, if needed stand near the walls and listen to the sounds, you don't even have shame, what! I don't have shame? During those times, did you at least let me take my breathe.. Sofa might not be comfortable, thats the reason he has come here to sleep sir, that temple… that temple belongs to us, its our god, you endowment people have many temples, but we have only one temple, why do you want to acquire it, twenty years back few endowment officers have come here just like you, and died under the chariot, my grandpa is the witness, again four officers have come two years back, even they are missing, I am the witness for it, and out of the officers who were handling the issuing case, four have been transferred and the others are missing, now even if you go missing, there will be no one left to inspect our temple, its time for the prayer..

On the fields path, village path! In the pump shed, You like money a lot right? I love money. Will you take 50rs if I give you, why wont I? I am leaving now… OK. Hey hey, why are you leaving? How can you leave without informing me, hey, he left, its a lie, no, its a fact my dear, no, he said and you have listened, yes, I heard, did you say that you like money... yes, it means that you are trying to steal my money, its not that madam, actually, you're misunderstanding me. Why the hell are you behaving so strange when I am asking my money, why are you looking wondered, guys, take her out, take her…. Shall I call next token sir, no more tokens for today, I am hearing some variety sounds… even the collections is good, what are you searching for, its following me, what happened sir, you guys said that there are no ghosts, but I am able to hear the voice of a ghost, friends run away and save your life… Ghost…look my dear, isn't it a crime to cheat people, its their mistake to get fooled, not mine, don't overact... We are doing this for living... You are stalking me but not telling me who you are... have you heard of bagarraju… bangarraju, is it the landlord bangarraju, then who did you think I am? Why will think wrong about you, those days the village was in romantic mode, he was a big flirt, you are our inspiration, you used to romance when we wore nickers, their have been so many stories about your romance... their isn't a single house that was not climbed by you, Why did you come here..? I not able to see you... A small problem with my son... So I came.. I heard about you... Anyways we are friends... Lets get some air and talk...? OK... We will talk come.. Coming... Ramu, shall we have dinner. No, later, I have some work. OK come dear, only we three are left, call your husband for dinner, You go ahead. Why? Aren't you hungry? I'm very hungry I feel like eating with Ramu after he's done with work stupid power, gets turned off at odd times, I am done with my dinner, you go and take care of your husband.. Ramu, Yes what baby? Had your dinner? Yes, what about sita? I don't know, she was feeling very hungry, has been waiting for you, how could you eat alone, to have food all we need is hunger, not husband, if its too late then she will get acidity, ask her to have food, sita, Sita.. Come and have food... I don't feel like eating now… Happy birthday Ramu. Can’t you wish me in the morning, is it that important to wake me up and wish, anyways, thank you, thank you… Go to sleep. Give the sweet to all the kids, happy birthday uncle... happy birthday Ramu, even I want sweet, give them also, come… why are you packing your clothes sita, I have to go back aunt, we thought he was good the other day... that day he drank, how long will he love me being in that mode, kindly listen to me, I have been trying to get closer to him, but he is unable to understand, I myself feel so embarrassed for begging him to love, he is not going to change, I am going to my mother, will apply for divorce bangarraju, whats this bangarraju? Has aunt gone mad.. What sathya, why did you call me in such a sweet tone, its not sweet tone, I feel like hitting you, sita said that she will leave, if she leaves then they will get divorced, what the heck, whom is she warning by telling that she will leave, all wives are the same, if a man is innocent, then wives will stamp him, oh god, as though you all are fools, even before we close our eyes you guys will have an affair, but my Ramu is very innocent, do something and unite them, I will unite them, Yes I will do that... ladies should have a competition, if a man is chased by few women, then a wife will strongly feel that she needs her husband, is this the reason why you used to go to krishna kumari house and spend hours with her, we should not tell everything to women.. Some they can’t understand and some they cannot take it.. Enough of your blush, first look at their issue, its my responsibility to unite our son and daughter in law, All right? Smile once, a bit, a little bit more, a bit more… all the while if you look at this, then how will your wife fall for you, whats this attire, those white shoes and this in shirt, who will fall for you if you look like this? You look exactly like our bangarraju brother, that dress looks so nice, mother... uncle looks handsome, you look very good Ramu, feels like looking at uncle after ages... but I feel as though I am seeing him for the first time, he is manly, means, he is not like you… Correct. How much you love me dear, it reflects on how carefully you have been taking care of my two wheeler, what happened? You should not go on this bike, I just don't like it..

Nothing, what are those in your hands… its mehendi, I will design your palms with them, come home… I am like a boat sailing in godavari river.. And your smile is the one which is showing its path, she has become mad with poems, like a star I just got prisoned in your eyes, oh my dear bujji, that was really a nice poem, come home, did you see yamaraja... this bangarraju has taken birth, only to enjoy life I think, irrespective of the places… times keeps changing chitragupta, I understood your words my lord, but unable to know its meaning, not all times are meant to be auspicious... there will be bad times and evil eye, wait and see.. Stop the vehicle, what grandpa? Bangarraju son has come... the right time has come, where will he go?

On a full moon day, under a banyan tree, on a wooden bed, you used to come in a peacock blue colour sari, with flowers in your hair, you used to feed him traditional food mixed with honey, and my father used to sleep on one side and used to eat happily, after that, he used to play with your anklets, after playing, used to chit chat, after talking, used to smile, smile and then, used to smile a lot, Ramubabu, ramubabu, I mistook you aas your dad and ran away with fear, why would you run away with fear even if it was dad?

What is that my lord, I shouldn't say anything bangarraju, if even you wont say, then who will tell me, to tell past an future is not fair on my part, is this the reason why you have sent me down, why are you punishing me like this, did I do heinous crimes… everyone should go through the process of destiny and fate… have killed him sir, rajendra have a close watch on bangarraju son, observe with whom he is talking and if you doubt anything, then inform me… sathya, listen, she can't bear if she gets to know about this danger….

Not even a single new person is entering the place, only girls are going sir… hey dear, who are you? I am bujji, what? I am bujji… why did you come? You said that you will apply mehendi - I would? - Yeah. Might have said it… can’t you ask your sister or aunty, no, you should only apply it… hey, don't move, it will get spoiled, any silly design will look beautiful, do you like these a lot.. Yes, as a child when I used to make sand houses on the banks of river godavari, and after I grew up as I started to build houses of wonderful dreams, I have only loved two things, one is you and the other is this.. This design might fade out in a week or 10 days, but these memories will never fade away, looks pretty, you leave, dear, thought of marrying you, no worries, I feel happy at least for this, sister, you are very lucky.. Sita, sita, what? He talks nicely with everyone in this world except me, its not that, kindly listen to me, there’s nothing to say, he doesn’t like me at all, how can you say that… there’s some other woman in life for sure, might be a nurse or a doctor, thats the reason he doesn’t talk to me properly even in america, it will be good if I leave him, sita, now you have raised a new doubt.. Bangarraju, are you listening? Do you what happened? They seem to part ways now itself, Its all because of you, why are you talking like that sathyamma, won’t I have love towards my son, its not that you don't love him, we don't have anyone in our life, its me and my son, since I am living a lonely life, I am worried about him… sathya, how did I die? Its all because of my fate, I felt so happy that you will be with me for the rest of my life, post marriage as we were living happily, one day you met with an accident and left us, do you know how much I cried? From then on I became adamant, I have been living looking after my son, and now if eve they get separated then I won’t live my dear… to have a wife like you is my luck, anyways, tell our daughter in law as to how to be with husband, let's try from her side, they might get closer, OK, only I have to face all the troubles, my fate.. You are worried about present, but I am unaware as to what sort of difficulties will bother us in the future…. Sita, we have our own calculations about our husband, in the same way even husbands think of their wives, every woman has one reason to blame her husband, she says he is not interested in me, in the same manner, every man has the same reason “ says that he is lost in his work “, women should be always smiling, if you go with a smile and greet him, he will sit beside you and will be lost in you, or else he will change his attire and will get engrossed in some news channel…. We need to compliment our husband 24 hours in a day, irrespective of our needs with him, they feel like on top of the earth if a woman compliments, any man will fall for a compliment and if its our husband then he will just stay by us… in war, there we shouldn’t hide weapons in the same way in bedroom and here we shouldn’t hide our beauty.. Weapons are the reasons for our victory, our glamour will make us win, Go, no, I am telling you to go, go…. Ramu… shall we go for a movie, movie! Why?, you move aside, when she is requesting you to take her for a movie.. How can you ask why, I have an important meeting at 6pm sathyamma, its at 60 clock rite, you guys will be back by 5pm itself, What I mean to say is.
