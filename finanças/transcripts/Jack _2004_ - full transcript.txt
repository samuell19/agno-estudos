(upbeat music) - [Anne] What's this? - [Paul] I'm putting in a hoop for Jack. - [Anne] What's going on here? - [Paul] What? - [Anne] What are you doing? - I'm putting in a hoop for Jack. - [Anne] Today? - [Paul] Yeah, it was the only day Mike was available. - It wasn't supposed to be today. You have to tell me these things. Oh, God, look at it. Oh, why did you? - Because this is the only spot it can go. - That's not the only spot. Oh, this is ridiculous, I mean, oh, I don't believe it. - He's gonna love it. - You know it, this is it, really. This is it, the last time. - But the roses have black spot already, I'll spray. - No, not with the, oh, dammit, leave me alone. Leave me alone. - [Jack Voiceover] Do you ever look at your family and wonder who they are? Those are my parents. - They're not my roses, they're the house's roses. - [Jack Voiceover] At least they used to be. - How's the boat building? - [Jack] Are we going to the movies? - [Paul] I have to move some stuff. - [Jack] But it's Saturday, and we always go to the movies on Saturday. - Jack wants to go to the movie. I thought I'd drop the stuff off, then maybe take him. - You're not taking him anywhere. - You're acting extreme, Anne. - Don't tell me how I'm acting. - Okay. Sorry, no movie today, Jack. - [Jack] Why not? - Because I say so. - [Jack] But we always go to the movies on Saturday. - Anne. - [Jack Voiceover] To be honest, I didn't give a damn about the movie, but there was something going on, and I didn't know what it was, and I didn't know what to do, except act normal. - [Paul] Tell Jack I'll call him later. - [Jack Voiceover] It's like you had a hero, and all of a sudden he's gone. When you're a kid and you've got a father who reminds you of Superman, who seems like he can do anything, a father who's the kind of guy that climbs on the roof to rescue your dweeby G.I. Joe when it's caught up there in some idiotic experiment. And then, one day, he's gone, disappeared into a million different green plastic garbage bags. No explanations offered. Nothing anyone says later makes a bit of difference. - Shot of the green? - [Jack] No thanks. - Listen, I was thinking, I could just stay at my place tonight, if you like. - Whatever makes you happy. - Look, if you want me here, I'm here. I just never know what you're thinking. - Why don't you let him move in already? He practically lives here anyway, so what's the big deal? Oh come on, he's living out of a duffel bag. You should at least give him a drawer. - I don't wanna rush things. It's Wednesday, so don't forget, dinner with Dad. - [Jack] Okay. - [Michael] Want a ride? - Sure. - See ya tonight. Wednesdays are very intense. - Yeah, it's the dinner with the dad thing. You know, when he first left, I wasn't allowed to see him at all. Then she felt guilty, so she started the Dinner with Dad program. You're lucky you missed the bit where she tried to be like my replacement dad. - [Michael] Oh, was that the basketball stuff? - Mm-hmm, and she's actually gotten pretty good. It's just a little weird. Especially the time she tried to take me to the father-son team dinner. Yeah, so are your parents still married? - Yeah, 43 years. You know, it's amazing to think of spending your whole life with the one person. - Yeah, equally amazing to watch your whole family fall apart. - For five bucks, name the guidance counselor I spieed shoplifting at K-Mart. - [Student] Wagstaff. - Laydon, I saw her slip a stapler into her purse, and then some Tootsie Rolls. (dream-like music) (whistle blowing) - All right, listen up. We're gonna start with some drills. Four lines, go, go. One passes to three, two passes to four. A braid, you guys, like a smooth strand of DNA. From one side of the gym to the other, let's go. Come on, synchronize, guys, synchronize. Know where the other men are, anticipate the next move. You're walking through it, guys, you look like a buncha pansies, come on. (whistle blowing) (basketball dribbling) - You know, my dad showed up again yesterday. - Oh yeah, what did you do this time? - He put a basketball hoop out front. - Oh really? That's great. - Yeah, except last night, I kinda lost my mind and attacked it. I tried to knock it down, and now it's just a wee bit tilted. - Tilting adds character. - Maybe. - [Jack Voiceover] When Mrs. Burka smiled at me, I think I turned beet red. I woulda stared at her, if only I could've figured out how to do it without getting caught. - You want an apple? - No thanks. - Hey, Samster Hamster boy, how you doing? - Good. - Want some milk? - No, we don't want milk, all right. We don't wanna talk, either. - You staying for dinner tonight, Jack? - Not tonight. - Okay. I like your mom. She always wants to know everything-- - No, my mom needs to get a life, okay? Every day I come home, she's like, do you wanna talk? She's thoroughly bored. (explosions) See what I just did? So, you gonna drop a bomb or what? - No, Max, I outgrew the impulse to blow things up about two years ago. I'm just waiting for you to catch up. (explosion) - Oh, napalm. - Daddy's home. Daddy's home, Daddy's home. - Hey, hey, monster man. (groaning) - Hey, hon, how was your day? - [Steve] Good. - Yeah? - [Steve] Good, really good. I scored a new client today. It's gonna mean extra work, but uh, that's what I'm here for, right? - Oh, no, here. Do you wanna beer or something? - Yes, please. - Great. - Thank you. Maxie, go deep. - Head's up. - Honey. Why are the trashcans still here? How many times have I told you to take them out back? - I better go, it's dinner with Dad. - Yeah, how is your dad, haven't seen him for a while. - He's good. - [Jack Voiceover] What I didn't tell Mr. B. is that every Wednesday night, my father and I played a weird game where we got all dressed up and he took me to some totally expensive restaurant and talked to me about incredibly serious stuff, like the meaning of life, while I was busy worrying about whether I was using the right fork. - [Waitress] What can I get you tonight? - I'll have the tuna, rare please. - [Waitress] Okay, and what would you like? - Chicken for me. And can I get french fries instead of scalloped potatoes, please? - [Waitress] Sure, honey. - Look, Jack, I've been spending a lotta time trying to figure things out. Now I don't know if this is gonna make any sense to you, but you're at an age now, that, people love to do things, right? Some people love to read, some people love to go to the movies. Your mom loves reading the newspaper. You love basketball. What I'm trying to say is that there are many different kinds of love. How we love, no, not how we love. What we allow ourselves to feel is very complicated. And, and, sometimes love doesn't has any limits. What do you think about when you think about love? - Nothing. I think nothing. - Nothing, you think nothing. So basically this dinner was a waste of time? - Pretty much. (horn honking) (soft music) - [Paul] Do you remember when we went on that huge Ferris wheel? - I think I was three. - Why is that parents always do things with kids when they're too young to remember? You enjoyed it very much. - Look, you're always asking me to remember. It's like a constant walk down Memory Lane. Do you remember when everything use to be normal? Do you remember when you still lived at our house? Come on, can we just stay in the present, here and now. - I was just thinking about things. - Duh. (soft music) (horn honking) - [Paul] Here, try the calamari. - Tastes like a deep-friend rubber band. So what's calamari? - It's Italian for deep-fried rubber band. Squid. Wanna try the portobello? - What is it? - Mushroom. How about I pick the restaurant the next time? - Might be a good idea. (soft music) - How was dinner with your father? - Good. - What did you eat? - Creepy stuff. - What did you talk about? - I have no idea. - Shall we hang this? - Okay. - You know, I got a hammer downstairs, if you need one? - No, no, it's not a big hole. - Listen, they're coming around to collect stuff for the homeless shelter tomorrow, so anything you don't need would be a bounty for the poor. - Sure. - Oh, very nice. - It's stuff I've been saving. Historical artifacts of my entire life, in case the Smithsonian ever needs to do an exhibit on me, the American boy. - Ah. - There are a few key elements in case I ever get amnesia and need to be reminded of who I am. - Right. Thank you. And listen, I meant to ask you. How would you feel if I built a Zendo in the backyard? - What's a Zendo? - It's like a meditation room. You could use it too whenever you need a moment. - [Anne] It'd be great. - Our friends thank you. - [Anne] Shoot a few? - Mom, you're embarrassing me. - Oh come on, You know, I could get good at this. Maybe I should join a team. Oh, come on, try again. - Okay. (laughing) - Come on, be a good sport, you should be proud. How many kids can say their moms can play basketball? Yes! It's gonna be okay, you know? That's it, that's it. - [Jack] Yeah. - Oh, come on. - Come on. Aren't you excited? Hi, Mr. Bailey. - Mrs. Stanford. - Go on. Go on. (dramatic music) - New drivers pass through levels. Each level offers more responsibility, freedom from restrictions. What's this? - Rear bumper. - Mm-hmm. Teenagers pick up their parents' driving habits. - Trunk. - Correct, how do your parents drive? Do they put it in reverse without looking behind? Do they pull out too fast. The more crashes the parents have had, the greater the likelihood the teen will crash. Get in the driver's seat. Have your parents crashed? - I don't know, they're divorced. - [Mr. Bailey] Put on your seat belt. Start her up. And drive it very, very slowly down the street. - [Jack] Okay. (car starting) (tires squealing) Sorry, sorry. - [Mr. Bailey] I have only one neck, smoothly. - [Jack] Sorry. - Seeing is believing. Think about your blind spots. You can't ever forget, there's always something you cannot see. - Yeah, that I know already. - [Jack Voiceover] Time passed. It wasn't like I got over it, but life went on. Except for now, my mom let my dad take me on Saturdays too. I was finally growing more hair on my legs than my mom, and things were pretty much things. (horn honking) (birds chirping) - [Paul] So, what's new? - [Jack] Not much. Are you okay? - Yeah. - You just have that look. - What look? - The one where you're about to say something that's gonna make me lose my lunch. Or the one where you pause for a really long time and you say something like, Grandma's sick, which means she's already dead or something like that. - Well Grandma's fine. But we need to talk. - See? - Look, Jack, I, I don't know if you can understand, but I'm gonna tell you. I have been running away from myself, all these years, and a person can't do that forever. It catches up. A while ago, I realized that, that I would be happier if I did not live with your or your mother. Hey, I love her. I always did, I always will and I still do, but. Do you remember Bob, my friend Bob? - Yeah, the guy you went on the trip with? - Mm-hmm. Bob and I are lovers. - I wanna go home. - [Paul] Jack! Jack. Jack. Jack? - Get in the car, I'll give you a ride. - I'll walk, thanks. - Get in the car, you're gonna get pneumonia. - I'll walk. - Jack, don't do this. - Do what? You're the one who's doing it. - I told you because I thought you should know. Nothing has changed, I'm exactly the same person I was 20 minutes ago. Jack, I'm still your father. - No you're not. - He never even told you? Elaine. Okay, yeah, I'll see you tomorrow, bye. What happened? - Well, other than my father telling me he was gay, I sent for a swim. How can this, I shoulda seen it coming. I shoulda been smarter, I shoulda been paying attention to what he was trying to tell me over all that lobster and calamari. - Your father loves you very much. - He's not my father. - Yes, he is, he's your father and you're his son. - No. Mom, no, no. He's a stranger, he's a person I don't know. He's got a whole other life. He's got a boyfriend. How can this even be happening? Did you know? Oh well, how did he tell you? Did he take you out in a rowboat too? - He doesn't like keeping secrets. - Well he shoulda kept that one. - He and Bob are getting an apartment together. Did he tell you that? - No, but he was probably about to when I jumped. Mom, I don't wanna see him anymore. (footsteps) (crickets chirping) - If you wanna talk, you gotta dig. - And what's to talk about? All of a sudden my father is a fairy queen. Is that why he left us, he's a fairy? - Don't use that word. - What word should I use? - Your father and I separated because we couldn't get along. We couldn't live together. You remember how we were always fighting. - Yeah, because it turns out Dad's a big old fag. How can he be a homo and have me as his kid.? Homos don't get married, and homos don't have kids. Was he always a homo? - Your father was always going through phases. Gardening, music, car repairs. It was always something. I actually thought this was one of his phases. - Why is he doing this to me? - No one is doing anything to you. He was telling you who he was, about his life, and he wanted to make you part of his life. - Well, if he's a homo, what does that make me? Am I homo too now? Because maybe that's it, maybe I'm a homo and I don't even know it. - Jack, you're two separate people. He is who he is, and you're gonna figure out who you are. - When he first left, I thought it was my fault. I was too boring, I wasn't enough of a movie freak, I wasn't fast enough at baseball. - Life is complicated. You think I didn't wonder what happened? He's your father, but he was my husband. (gentle music) Maybe it was me, Jack. Maybe it was something I did. I wasn't a good enough wife. I wasn't a good enough mother. I never made breakfast. I smoke. I hate cleaning the house. - No. No, no, no, it's not you. It's Dad, it's his fault. Mom, I hate him. I hate him, I hate him, I hate him, I hate him. - Shh. (phone ringing) - [Jack Voiceover] My father called about 20 times a day trying to get me to let him be my father again. He would drive over and just sit outside, not moving, like a statue. I refused to talk to him, and even that didn't work. (fire alarm ringing) - You ever just wanna go up to a girl and plant one on her? Like, I bet I can get that girl to kiss me. - [Max] You don't even know her. - So? - What's the deal with you? Suddenly, you're Mr. Hormonal. You have to kiss a girl or you're gonna die or something. - Okay, just pick a girl and I bet I can get her to kiss me. - Fine. And what about her? - [Jack] Can't you at least pick someone who's human? Maggie Rogers? No, the degree of difficulty on her is just a big too high. - Well, you can't just go up and kiss somebody. You'll get arrested. Okay, remember that kindergartener who got expelled? You have to ask first. - [Teacher] Is this where you're supposed to be? - Yeah, yeah it is, for the moment, this is exactly where I'm supposed to be. (dramatic music) Okay, how did you do that? Did you give her money? Did you offer to do her homework, what? - No, I just I said I thought she was really pretty and that I wanted to kiss her. I said I felt compelled to kiss her. - And that worked? - Yep. - Wow, your first kiss. - Nah, not my first. Maryann Miller in the second grade used to kiss me all the time, and she was in the third grade. - An older woman. - Yeah. - End of drill. Come on, everyone back to class. - Hey. - [Anne] Hey. - [Paul] Thanks for meeting me. - It's fine. Where's the Bob? - His name is Bob, not the Bob, and he had a meeting at the last minute. - Oh. Okay. - New bookcase? - Oh yeah, yeah. Actually, that's how I met Michael. I hired him to build me a bookcase. - Jack still doesn't wanna see me? - No. He's 15. He's trying to grow up. You deserted him in more ways than one, you know. - Bob and I being together doesn't mean I'm deserting Jack. - Really? I'll try telling him that. You were his hero. Life isn't as simple for Jack as it is for you. - Annie, with all due respect, you have know idea what's simple for me. - What do you want? - For everything to be okay. - What furniture do you want? - I'll take the chair. - What, that chair? - No, no, no. - It's my chair. - No, no, I like that chair. Jack likes that chair. Take that chair. - That chair, I hate that chair. I've always hated that chair, you know that. Couch? Watch, watch. - [Anne] I got it, I got it, I got it. - Okay? - [Anne] Here, wait a minute. - One, two, three. (sighing) Okay, here. - What? - Come on, it's better to break up like that. - Oh please. - Do you remember how we met? - Yeah, summer camp, I was nine, you were seven. ♪ Oh no, not you ♪ How kind you were - Come on, seriously. Anne, Annie. - No, I remember. Here, here. You spilled coffee in my book and lied about it. - I didn't lie. It was an accident. I was nervous. I was so in love with you. (gentle music) - This is yours. - Annie, I need you to know something. This has nothing to do with you. - This has everything to do with me. - It's my life, and you messed it up. No, no, no, no, you don't get to do that. You don't dump on somebody and then comfort them. It's just against the rules. - Appreciate your helping out with Jack. I know it's not easy. (crying) - It's worse than that. I keep defending you, and all I wanna do is strangle you. (door opening) (crying) - Hi, Jack. I came by to pick up a few things for the apartment. Look, I know you don't wanna spend time with me right now, so, instead of dinner, I thought maybe we could go bowling. You know, a group activity might be better. - No thanks. - We can bring Max if you want. There's also somebody I'd like to introduce you too. The daughter of a friend mine, Maggie Rogers. - The Maggie Rogers? - Well, I don't know if it's The Maggie Rogers. But I think she goes to your school. Anyway, I thought we'd bowl a few rounds. - Okay. And it's games, you bowl games, not rounds. - [Jack Voiceover] As much as I hated the idea of being around my father and the Bob, it was Maggie that made me do it. - [Maggie] Hey, Jack. - Hey. - Max. Five and a half, please. - Full sizes only. - Okay, six. - No sixes. Make it a seven. - [Jack Voiceover] The minute I saw her, I turned green. The only thing missing was the yearbook photographer. - What size for you? - Oh, I bowl in socks, it gives me more slide. - Right. - So are you like alone here or what? - No, that's my father. - [Max] Who's the other guy? - Why did I bring you? - Because you like me, you like me very much. Okay, everyone, let's take a practice round and then we'll start. - Burpa, that's what they call him, Max Burpa. (cheering) - That's my girl. Go, Maggie, yeah. - Okay, Jack, you're up. - Way to go, Jack, make potholes, confuse everyone. - Jack, next time try to keep your wrist straight. - Bob, no advice, thanks. - Isn't Maggie great? - Great is an understatement. - [Maggie] You've already had a hot dog, nachos and a soda, and what else? - I don't know, some Tootsie Rolls, if you're counting. I can definitely go for ice cream. Speaking of which, guess who's here. - No idea. - Okay, I'll rephrase. For $200, guess which one of our schoolmates bowls in a league. - Eddie Hayes? No way, that's so queer. He's in a league? (pins falling) - Hey, we're going to the opera. - [Paul] Well, what are you seeing? - Carmen. - Carmen. - [Bob] How'd you get tickets? I thought it was sold out. - It was, but you know John when he sets his mind to something. - Do you have a medical problem? - Hmm? - You know, they have drugs for people who are hyper. - Yeah, you see, they thought he was hyper but the tests came back normal. - Maybe they should get him tested again. - I am taking Jim to Provincetown for Memorial Day. - Why? - He's never been. - Never? - [Jack Voiceover] I was remembering the first time I met the Bob. About nine months after he moved out, my dad and I were going on one of our adventures, a boat trip to St. Michael's Island, and my dad asked if he could bring a friend. Had I known then what I know now, I woulda said no. - Okay, anybody have any shoes they haven't returned. - [Jack] Yeah. - [Maggie] I took mine back already. - [Paul] Okay, I'll see you guys at the car. - See you, guys. - See you outside. (clapping) - Oh my God. - Oh, gross. - Am I seeing what I think I'm seeing? - [Maggie] Gross, totally gross. - Okay, was that artificial respiration or something? Was there a reason for that, can you tell me? - [Maggie] Shut up, just shut up. Can you ever just not talk? - He kissed the guy right on the mouth, okay. Not on the cheek. - Why do they have to make out in public? Do your parents make out in public? - No, no, actually my parents avoid touching at all times. - [Jack Voiceover] This was the beginning of the end. - Look, it's nothing to go insane about, okay? - You can use my locker til it wears off. - It's goddam black magic marker. It's permanent, it doesn't wear off. Did you do this? - No, I didn't do it. But maybe I accidentally mentioned a bit about two guys kissing to a couple people. Well, it freaked me out, okay? I'm over it now. I mean I get it, it's a disease, okay, like a sickness. Same as guys who chop people up, put the pieces outta the house. - You're completely mentally ill, you know that? No! Don't polish it. Charming, at this rate, there will be a whole novel up there by the end of the year. - Talk to your girlfriend, fag baby. - I don't know who you think you are. I go bowling with you and your rodent friend as a favor, and this is what happens? - What is what happens? I mean, I stupidly agree to go bowling with you and your queer bait father, and they write fag baby on my locker. - Look, this is my life, and you and your friend are like kamikazes. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - Ask the rodent. - Okay, Maggie won't speak to me and she says you know why. - There's been a small letter-writing accident, okay. - What are you talking about? - Someone circulated like a chain letter to the whole school about the bowling alley. - Someone other than you? - Yeah. - Eddie Hayes? Okay, show me. $25 to the one who first identifies which beautiful babe and star of the basketball court I spotted last night at a homosexual soiree at the local 10-pin Lanes. Post your answers on the bulletin board in hall. Name names, and receive money. - Look, it'll be fine. Okay, no one's gonna post anything. - They wrote fag baby on my locker. You don't think they'll write a name for money? - Yeah, well, they should've written it on Maggie's locker, right, because her dad's one of the fags. But she's too cool. - Oh, yeah, that makes me feel a lot better except for one little thing. Turns out my dad's a fag too. - What? - Shut up, shut up. I feel sick. - Don't worry, okay, it's the tater tots. They're hard to digest. How do you know your dad is, you know, a fagola? - He told me, okay, in a canoe. And don't call him that. And if you tell anyone, I'm gonna torture you, starting with your fingernails. - Okay, all right. - I have to go home. - You have a fever? You gonna faint? - No, I just, I've had this before. I just need to call my mom. - Okay. (dial tone) (phone dialing) - [Anne] Hello. - Mrs. Stanford, this is Miss Morgan. I'm the school nurse at Rolling Hills. I have Jack here in the office, and he's not feeling well. - Dizzy and nauseated. - [Anne] Is he okay? - Shall I put him on? - You have to pick me up. - [Anne] Are you really sick? - Right now, Mom, you have to pick me up. - [Anne] Jack? - So shall we call this a mental health moment? - Call it whatever you want. - I hate children. - Look, you can't go home, all right. Don't leave me alone in this place. - Yeah, you're right, I don't need to go home. I can move, like to another country. (birds chirping) - So what if your dad's queer? I don't care. - He sleeps with Bob. They're lovers. - So? I sleep with my dog. - It's not the same thing. - Can I ask you a question? - No. - What do you think they do? - Look, I don't know and I don't wanna know. - Look, maybe it's just a phase, okay. He hasn't tried to make you queer, has he? - Max, it's not a phase, okay. And you can't make a person queer. They either are or they aren't. (door opening) - What's going on here? - I'm waiting for my mom. - And you? - Waiting for his mom. He's sick, I didn't wanna leave him alone. In case he loses consciousness. - Five minutes from now, I don't wanna see you here. - You all right? You got a sore throat? Did something happen? Your father called this morning. Next Wednesday, instead of going out to dinner, he wants you to come to the apartment. - No. - [Anne] I told him you would. - Mom, I've had enough of the whole Dad thing. I'm about two minutes away from losing my mind because they wrote fag baby on my locker. - Kids are idiots. Boy, you need a haircut. - Both hands on the wheel please. - You have hair just like your father's. No matter what you do to it, it wants to do something else. - No, Mom, I am not like my father. There is nothing about me that is like my father. I don't wanna have dinner with him, or see his apartment, or spend quality time with his boyfriend. Got it? - Maggie's gonna be there. - We're not speaking. - Jack, I know the situation isn't easy. Sometimes you have to wrestle with things to make them fit. Your father is not something to be ashamed of. He realized things weren't working out, and he did what he had to do. Sometimes people spend their whole lives trying to figure out what makes them happy. - So are you happy? - I might not be happy even if I were happy. He took a risk. Maybe you should be proud of him. - Oh come on, you don't even believe what you just said. He wrecked everything. It's not okay. - I know. What do you say we get some Ring Dings? - [Jack] Hit her? - [Anne] What? - [Jack] Hit her. - [Anne] Stop that. - I'm not talking to you. - Hi, I'm Anne, Jack's mom. - Hi, Maggie, Maggie Rogers. - Come on in. - Mom, hello? - I'm sorry I was harsh before. Max is a total rodent, but, about the other stuff, the letters and the locker, I'm sorry. - But why me, it was your father that was kissing the guy. - I know, I overreacted and I'm sorry. - Unfortunately, I'm sorry doesn't remove magic marker. - I can't control everything. - So do your friends know about your dad? Did he take you out in a rowboat and confess too? - Nope. One day, there was just some guy sleeping over. - Yeah, my dad moved into the guestroom, and then he moved out. And I thought it was insomnia, because he always had insomnia. But one Saturday morning, he just took all this stuff and started packing it in Hefty bags. And all I kept saying was, Are we going to the movies? Are we going to the movies? Because we always used to go to the movies on Saturday. And I knew something horrible was happening. I just didn't know what. - So, uh, is this gonna be something special? - Yeah, it's gonna be a Zendo. - Cool, Zendo, I've never seen one in someone's backyard before. - [Jack] You don't even know what a Zendo is. - Yes I do. It's a place where people. It's a place where people, like, Jack, what do people do in a Zendo? - They meditate. Yeah, it's a place where people meditate. - [Maggie] Cool. - Yeah. So are you like the poster child for the well-adjusted gay dad club? - It's not really like I have a choice. Are you going to your dad's house for dinner next week? - I don't know. - I'll go if you go. - Okay. Sure. - Do you wanna go to a movie? - Now? - No, like on Friday or something. - Um, sure. Yeah, okay, I guess I could go. Do we dare be seen in public? - Don't worry, I'll protect you. Jack, you'll get used to it. I did. - No, I don't think I will. (gentle music) - [Anne] Elaine, look, can I call you back? Great, bye-bye. - I'm going, but I'm not gonna eat. - Is that what you're wearing? - It's what I wear to school. - Don't you wanna get dressed up for your father and Maggie? - Maggie, yes, my father, no. - Hey, what about meeting the Bob? - Mom, I already met the Bob when we went bowling and once a long time ago. - When a long time ago? - When we went to St. Michael's Island with Dad. Bob came along. - Really, Bob was there? I thought they just met. - No, he's known him for a while. So do I have to change? - I don't care, wear whatever you want. - [Jack Voiceover] I was at his apartment, and all I kept thinking about was him being gay and this being the place that he and the Bob lived in together. I wanted to puke. That is, until I thought about Maggie. (door buzzing) - Hey, hi ya. Welcome. Dining room, Bob, Jack's here. That's the kitchen. Let me show you this room. With a view. Sofa looks pretty good here, doesn't it? - Yeah, is that the chair that used to be in the living room? - That's the chair that used to be in the living room. That's the coffee table that I built you when you were little. You've heard that story before. - Hi, Jack. - Nice slippers. - Oh, thanks, I picked them up at an antique fair. I think they may have belonged to Greta Garbo. At least that's what the guy told me. I'll go check the oven. - Come on, I wanna show you the view. Not bad, huh? Listen, Jack, I was hoping I could come to your game, if that's okay. - Okay, where's Maggie? - She should be here any minute. (door buzzing) There you go. - Hi, hi, hi. Come on in, Maggie. You look wonderful, John. Nice to see you. - Hi. - Hi. - Jack, we'll only be able to stay a minute. - Hey, how are you? Hello, dear, how are you? Come in, come. - [Bob] Dinner's just about ready, guys. - Okay. - I'm not hungry, I'd like to go home. - Bob worked very hard on this dinner. You'll hurt his feelings. - I don't care about his feelings. I don't even know him. I mean, shouldn't you care more about my feelings than his? Didn't I come first? - You know I care about your feelings. Then why are you doing this to me? - I'm not doing anything to you. - Well then who are you doing it to? - Jack, who I am, and who I love is about me. It is not about you. - Well then how come they call me fag baby at school? - Do you want me to talk to them? - Like what, have a school assembly? Okay, everybody, Jack's father is here to talk about homosexuality and why we shouldn't call his son fag baby. Come on. - Okay, you're right. You have every right to be upset. Is there anything I can do to help? - You can help me by not being gay. - I wish I could do that, but I, you know, it would make my life easier too. - Well then just do it, do it for me. - I can't do that, Jack. - Then I'd like to go home. - Hey, dinner's ready. - Bob, Jack's not feeling that well. I'm gonna drive him home. - Oh. - I feel fine. I just don't wanna be here with the two of you. - You were incredibly rude to Bob tonight. You know better than that. Wasn't right. - You go and do this thing of yours, you find yourself or whatever, and then, you expect everybody to knock themselves out understanding it. None of that is right. - Jack. Jack. - [Anne] What happened? - He's mad about me, he's mad about Bob. I don't know what to do. - Can you blame him? - What happened to my great defender? - She quit. (cheerleaders cheering) - Hey, hi guys, where's Steve? - He's working late, new client. Hi, Michael, how's it going? - Oh, it goes and I go with it. - Why do I think everyone's looking at me? - You may think that they are all looking at you, but they are not. - I know, I know. Oh my God, he showed up. Hi. They're not gonna sit with us, are they? - No, they're not gonna sit with us. (cheering and booing) (cheering) (dramatic music) (whistle blowing) (upbeat music) (cheering) (cheering) (upbeat music) (cheering and booing) (upbeat music) (whistle blowing) (cheerleaders cheering) - [Coach] It's your foot? - Yeah. - [Coach] Do you think you can stand on it? - [Jack] I'm not sure. - [Coach] I'll have to take a look. - Ow, ow. (applause) (whistle blowing) - [Jack Voiceover] Life is funny. One minute, I was running to the cheers of the crowd, and the next I was being wheeled down a hall on a gurney by my parents and their boyfriends. - You were playing beautifully. - Who belongs to who? We can't have a thousand people back here, immediate family only. - We're the parents. - Pick any two, the rest can stay in the waiting room. - Who's in charge here? Well, there's, uh, nothing broken, but you do have a very bad sprain. I'd like to have an air cast and crutches, please. Now, I'd like you to keep this elevated tonight and all day tomorrow. I want you to have ice on it 30 minutes out of every hour. Any problems, give me a call. - What about basketball? - Well, I think you better learn to walk before you run. - Maybe we shouldn't have all gone to the game. Maybe it ruined your concentration. - It's not your fault. My leg just got tangled with the other guy's, that's it. - Hey, kiddo, you got messages. Your coach, Maggie, and Elaine. She said she'll come over during the day tomorrow and hang out with you while everyone's at work. - Oh that's so nice. She adores you. She thinks you're very special. - I am very special. - I know, but it's nice when someone else agrees with you. - Mom? - Mm? - What's it mean when your father picks a boring boyfriend? - That he had a lapse in judgment after us. - That's what I thought. - Enough? - Thank you. - You're welcome. (birds chirping) - You look very pale. - I feel very pale. - Do you want another pill? - No thanks. - [Jack Voiceover] If she hadn't been Mrs. Burka, Max's mother, I would have asked her to do that to my whole body for hours on end. I wondered if she knew how she was making me feel. - That feels good. - Well, I better run. I told Steve I'd be home, and you know how he gets if everything isn't perfect. You rest a while longer, okay? Your mom's gonna be home soon. (birds chirping) - Oh, hey. - So, are you like down for the count or what? - Down, but not out - Hey, well, I brought you a present. - Yeah, what, homework? - Ta-da. - Hi. - Hi. - I hope you're not out. I'm really looking forward to Friday. I assume you're still free? - Free but crippled. - Well, what's happening Friday? - We have a date. - Really? Well, uh, can I come? - No, Max, because then it wouldn't be a date. - Anyways, I'm gonna be late, piano lesson day. (soft music) - Did you see that? She just kissed you. That's like the second time in recent history. Well this is better than TV. I'm watching you go through puberty. - So, uh, what do you do in a Zendo? Just sit and wait? - No waiting, just sitting. - And then what? - Nothing. - I don't get it. - Well there's nothing to get, nothing happens. But if you do it enough, you get yourself. - Okay. (soft music) - [Jack] So how many times have you seen that film? - Like two million. - Yeah. My dad used to take me to the movies every Saturday. - Mine did too, maybe it's like a gay dad thing or something. I'm kidding. - So is it better or worse to be a girl or a guy with a gay dad? - I think it's worse for a guy. It's more threatening or something, I don't know. - Yeah, I have to say, when he first told me, I kept thinking, Does that mean I'm gay too? - And now? - Oh, now I'm sure I'm not gay. So how come you never talk about your mom? - Because she's not around. - Is she dead? - No, she lives in Virginia. Three years ago, she invited me to come and visit, and I remember I spent the whole summer baby-sitting her two new kids while she went off with her friends and got her nails done. She's got a new life, a new husband, and as far as she's concerned, my dad and I are just mistakes she made a long time ago. - But she's your mom, right? - Yeah. Then she got annoyed about something, threw her stuff in the back of a car and, never came back. - How old were you? - Six. And I remember, I thought it was my fault, like I thought I had done something wrong. - Yeah, I thought I was too boring. Good night. - Can you get out? - I can try. (giggling) - Thank you. - Welcome. - [Michael] Hey. - Sorry about that, we just started talking. - Oh, that's all right. So you want me to drive you guys somewhere where you can make out or something? - Michael, it's our first date, okay? - Geez, kids today, you're damned if you do, damned if you don't. - Sorry about that. - Thank you. (car starting) - Thank you. - You're welcome. - So, um, I guess I'll phone you tomorrow. - Okay. - [Maggie] Okay, thank you. - Bye. - [Maggie] Bye. - So? - Well, if I'd known dating was that easy, I woulda started when I was like two. We watched the film, I held her hand, and her hand was sweaty, and my hand was sweaty, and our sweat just kind of mixed. And then we had ice cream, and the vanilla melted with the chocolate, and, it was all just kind of fantastic. - Yeah, I'll bet it was. (car starting) - You got enough warm clothes? - Yeah. - You got money? - Yep. - It was very nice of Elaine to invite you. - Yeah, I know, I'm Max's entertainment. - Have a good time. - [Jack] Bye. - Bye. (tires squealing) (horn honking) - If someone could read the signs, we'd know where to get off. - Steve, this is not my fault, you're driving the car. - That's what you say. - [Jack Voiceover] Something about Mr. Burka swerving made me think of Mr. Bailey. Swerving on a highway was definitely not a Mr. Bailey thing to do. Made me think of him asking, Had my parents crashed? - [Elaine] Dinner with Uncle Morris and Aunt Mary is 7:30, and they're looking forward to seeing you. - [Steve] Did they write seeing you or soaking you? Every time we go out to dinner with them, I have to pay the check. - [Elaine] So just decide that this time you won't. - [Steve] I grew up on this lake. I bet you didn't know that, Jack. Almost drowned in this bad boy once. - [Max] Every year, he tells us about how he almost drowned. - [Steve] You know, it means something to have a place to come back to - People always feel the need to confess on a lake. I myself don't like lakes anymore. They're overrated. - Boy, this is the life, huh? Million miles away from everything. - Million years away. - No littering please. - Feeding the fish. - Hey, Captain, toss me those chips. - [Sam] What's a lake made out of? - [Elaine] Oh, a lake's like a really big puddle. - [Sam] Well, what's a mountain made out of? - [Elaine] Mountain's like a big rock. - [Sam] Do rocks grow? - [Max] Only in your head. - [Elaine] Max. (murmuring) - Uh, could I have some more ketchup? (murmuring) - Hey, Honey, can I get a refill here, thanks? - Any time of day. We've called him on emergencies. - So, how goes it in the market? Any tips? - No tips. Only top-secret insight I'm not privy to share. What do I owe you for Mary and myself? - It's okay, Morris, we'll split it 50-50. - But they've got three extra people. - In the morning, I want you all to come down to the house, and I'll make you up a nice big breakfast. - You know, I got this. Whole, half, what's the difference? - What pleases you pleases the court. - Maybe next time, Morris. - Sweetie, thank you for everything. - [Jack] It's very old-fashioned. - [Max] Yeah, like prison. - [Jack] No, I like it. (door opening) - [Elaine] Well you boys sleep well. Is everything okay? - [Max] Mm-hmm. - [Elaine] Good night, Jack. - [Jack] Love you. - What was that, I love you? - I don't know, it just kinda slipped out. - [Steve] Only top-secret insight I am not privy to. What an ass. - [Elaine] Honey, you could have split the check. - [Steve] What are you always on me for? This is my vacation. Why can't I relax for 10 seconds? So what if I pick up the check? - [Elaine] Well you're the one who said you always getting soaked. - [Steve] Can't I complain without you throwing it my face? You know what, no, you know what? Maybe the problem is you. - We should get pneumonia not to hear them? - Is this normal? - It may not be normal, but they do it all the time. - [Steve] I am so sick of being criticized. Not one thing I do is right, according to you. No no, shut up, Elaine, just shut up! - We can hear you! - [Jack Voiceover] Even the clanking of the fan couldn't get their voices outta my head. I closed my eyes, trying to think of something else, anything else. (Steve yelling) - [Sam] I told you he was sleeping. - Pack up, we're outta here. We're leaving, get up. - Where are we going? - Home. My father beat up my mom, okay. He hauled off and slugged her. Well, my dad once threw a box of donuts at my mom, and they went flying everywhere. - Pack, you idiot. - [Sam] Where's Dad? - What an asshole. This isn't the first time, you know. - [Sam] I want my dad. (door opening) - Okay, so we have everything? - Where's my dad? - He went for a walk with your uncle. - I'll put the stuff in the car. - Okay. - [Jack Voiceover] It was nothing like when my dad threw the donuts, it was 1,000 times worse. Everything that had happened to my family and everything that I'd ever felt about the Burkas or anyone else was spilling out all over the place, and I didn't know how to stop it. (gentle music) - Here, you boys go and get yourself something, okay? - [Jack Voiceover] I had this image of myself as a grown-up, sitting in the car with her, while the kids were in the store. I guess I just didn't think she should be alone. I guess I wanted to protect her. - Why don't you go on onside, see if something catches your eye? - I don't know what to say. - You don't have to say anything. (door closing) (crying) (dial tone) (phone ringing) - [Recording] To place a collect call, press two. Please state your name. - [Jack] Jack. (phone ringing) - [Anne On Answering Machine] We're not home right now, but leave your name and number, we'll call you back. - [Recording] Will you accept charges? (dial tone) (phone dialing) - [Record] To place a collect call, press two. Please state your name. - [Jack] Jack. (phone ringing) - [Recording] You have a collect call from Jack. Will you accept charges, press one. - [Paul] Jack? - Yeah, Dad, press one. (beeping) - [Paul] Jack, hello. - Dad? - [Paul] Jack? Is everything all right? - Mr. Burka hit Mrs. Burka. - [Paul] What do you mean, Jack? - Hit her, you know, hit her, like in a boxing match only without a ring. - [Paul] Oh, is Elaine all right? - [Jack] No, I mean, she's driving but her face looks like a hamburger. - [Paul] I'll meet you at the Burkas. Just keep it together until you get there, okay? - Okay. Dad? - [Paul] Yeah, yeah. - Promise you'll pick me up. - [Paul] I promise, I'll be there. - [Jack Voiceover] I realized at that moment that there were only three people in the world that I could turn to. Mrs. Burka, who couldn't help anyone right now. My mother, who wasn't home. And my father, who was. - Hey. Did you guys get everything you wanted? - Yeah, yeah, we're fine, let's just go. - I got you a present. - Thank you, Jack. (car starting) (gentle music) - [Max] How come he's here? - [Jack] Because I called him. - [Max] What did you do, send smoke signals? - [Paul] Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm okay. - [Anne] Did you call the police? - He didn't mean it, he just, he gets angry. - Help them out with the bags. Are you expecting him back today or not? - I don't know, I think he's gonna stay with his family for a few days. - Come on, boys, come on, come on. - Come on, let's put some ice on that. Do you think anything's broken? - No, it's. - Are you sure? - It's fine, it's bruised, not broken. - Listen, if you mention one word of this to anyone, I will have you taken care of. - Taken care of? - Yeah, I will kill you, okay, I will have you killed. - Max, hello, it's me, Jack. Jack, your best friend. Okay, first of all, you're scaring me. Second of all, you're acting demented. And third of all, if you don't start acting nicer to your own mom I'm gonna kill you. (birds chirping) - I keep trying to imagine Mr. Burka hitting Mrs. Burka. And every time I come close to the moment when something bad happens, my mind just freezes. Mr. B hitting Mrs. B. - Pretty scary. - I imagine myself older, bigger, blocking at Mr. Burka's punch with one arm, knocking him out with the other. - Hey, Max. - [Max] Hey. - How's your mom doing? - She looks like she got her face put in a Cuisinart. - Look, Bob and I are having some people over next Saturday for brunch, why don't you two come? - Look, I may have called you, but I still don't wanna hang out with you. - Oh, I know you don't wanna hang out with me. But Maggie Rogers was coming, so. - Sure, for how long, five minutes? - No, for the whole thing. - That's not fair. Come on, that's flat-out bribery. You know I'm weak when it comes to her. - So, are you coming or not? - Yeah. - Good. Max, you, little football? Come on, here we go. - No, my leg, can't. - Okay, come on. Gannon, to Rice. (crying) - What am I gonna do? - You're gonna take care of yourself for once. That's what you're gonna do. - What about the kids? - The kids don't wanna see you get hit anymore. (crying) - Jack gave me this. He just. (crying) Anne, I'm so scared. (soft music) (crying) (Paul yelling) (upbeat music) - You must be Jack. You look just like your father. How's school? I hear so much about you. - Um, actually I'm Max. That's Jack right there. - [Maggie] Let's go. I think that woman who cornered Max is Bob's shrink. - I didn't know that Bob had a shrink. - Yeah, my Dad took me to see him a couple times. Did I mention that I hate my dad's boyfriend? Okay, he clips his toenails and then he eats the pieces. I caught him doing it when he thought no one was looking. Isn't that disgusting? - Yeah. - Ugh. - Don't you wish your dad would just find some girl, get married and then all this would stop? - No, I'd be totally jealous. - Oh. So, can I kiss you? - No. - Why not? - Because you kiss everyone. - I do not. - Come on, I saw you with Jenny. - Yeah, but that was different. - Oh. - It was. And besides, you kissed me the other day, so that's where I got the idea. - Yeah, but you were injured. And you've gotta wait til you earn my trust, and then you can kiss me. - Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. - Hey, do you think Max is okay? - No. (giggling) (retching) - [Jack] Max? Max! - What? - Ew, are you stuck? - [Max] No. - Hey, are you okay? Why are you throwing up into a trash chute into a restroom like a normal person? - Um, can we get you some seltzer or something? - Yeah, that'd be great. Why don't you go get it? - Okay. - What is wrong with you? Okay, why do I feel like I'm seeing tomorrow's headlines, teenager dies at homosexual brunch? This is totally pathetic, Max. Oh, what are you gonna do, you're gonna hit me? - Look, just leave me alone, okay. I'm not doing anything, it's none of your business. - Oh, it's none of my business, and that's why you're doing it at my dad's apartment instead of your own goddam house. - There's no one at my house, asshole, remember? - You're driving me crazy, Max. - No, no no no, you're driving me crazy. - Okay, look, your life is a complete mess but you don't have to make it a bigger drama than it already is. - Look who's talking, okay, you have no idea. Have you ever seen your parents fight? Huh? Literally haul off and punch each other? If you ever heard the kinds of things my parents say to each other, you'd die. I mean, they hate each other, okay. And right now, I hate both of them. How do you think that makes me feel? - Look, Max, you're not your father. You're not your mother, you're you. And you have to take care of yourself, and you have to protect yourself, and you have to find a way through this. And, okay, you can't fix it, but it doesn't mean you should wreck your own life either. - This coming from someone who hates his own father. I'd trade my dad with yours in a second. - No, Max, you can't do that. You don't trade one set of problems for another. - Who says? What are you, the pope or something? - Okay, I don't know what to do. Max, I don't know what to do. Nothing I say is the right thing, and you're scaring me, okay. I mean, I already watched my whole family fall apart, and the truth is is that I thought your family was the perfect family. Now look, both our families are nuts. (retching) God, it stinks in here. - Sorry. - Um, this is all I could find. - He's completely drunk. - Okay, Max, let's take a little walk. (dial tone) (phone dialing) (phone ringing) - [Anne] Hello. - Hi, Mom. - [Anne] Jack? - Um, Max went a little crazy at dad's party today. I mean, everything's fine, everything's under control. But I think Max and I are gonna stay here tonight. - [Anne] Do you want me to come and get you? I can be there in two minutes. You sure you're not being held hostage? - No, Mom, everything's okay, there's no hostage situation. - [Anne] Okay, bye. - Bye. - You know, Max is really lucky to have you as a friend. I spoke with Elaine. She said Steve is getting help, and they're going to therapy. - Is he gonna move back in? - Uh, don't know, but it is never over until it is over. - That's true. Hey, Dad. - Yeah. - Do you remember when we went to St. Michael's with Bob? - Mm-hmm. - Well, were you and him together then? - No, we were just friends then. - Yeah, that's what I thought. - We'll come back for that. (upbeat music) - Okay, let's try it again, be careful. - You know, we don't have to do this in the rain. I can wait and get my license when I'm 30. It's no problem. - Okay great, come on, let's go, cut the wheel. Come on. Cut. Cut a little more. Cut it more. Look, you're doing fine. (banging) - [Jack] What happened? - Did you do that on purpose? - No, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. Why don't we call it a day today, okay? - A car is not a car, it's a machine. - When you're ready, I'd like to take you for your driver's test. - It's okay, Michael said he would. - I know, but I'd like to, if you don't mind. - Yeah, sure. - Are you gonna hate me forever? - I don't know. - Hard to believe. You are turning 16. - Yeah, it kinda creeps up on you. - Yeah. Maybe we should do something special. Do you remember when we went to the circus? - Yeah, I was six. You took 10 of my friends, we had front-row seats, and then the lion bit the head off the monkey, and we all had nightmares for about a week. Well, Mom's baking a cake. I think that should be good enough. - Okay. (car starting) - [Jack Voiceover] When you're a kid, everyone makes a big deal outta your birthday. You get presents, your mom brings cupcakes to your school. It's like a national holiday. The fact is, when you're 16, you're not 15 anymore. You wake up, you look at yourself, and there you are. Your hopes, dreams and fantasies starting right at you. At a certain point, you stop waiting for your life to begin. You realize this is your life, right here, right now. Make of it what you will, what you can. - [Max] Hey. - So what, when I graduate is somebody gonna write fag baby grows up in big letters on the school roof? - Maybe? Happy birthday. - Thanks. What is it, a pipe bomb, a gun? - No. - Okay. Condoms? You got me condoms for my birthday? - [Max] Yeah. - Okay, well thanks for thinking of me in such a weirdly personal way. I'll treasure them. And then I'll use them when I'm like 50 and married or something. (school bell ringing) - [Teacher] So, your papers are due next week. And all papers are due, no exceptions. - [Jack Voiceover] The thing about people is that they're human. As obvious as that is, we have to remember it. People are who they are. And once you realize that, you'll end up less disappointed. And then sometimes they'll surprise you. - Jack, Jack? Are you with us? - Not really. - So, uh, see your cake? - Yeah, it's fantastic. - I got these guys, but, uh, I thought I better ask you first. - Do we actually have to put them on the cake? I just think I'm a little too old for decorations. - I think you're right. - What is that? - It's a Zendo. - A Zendo. - Yeah, a long story. - It's a Zendo. So, this is where I had my garden. And this is where I used to play with Jack. - It's not a historical landmark, we still live here. - I know, I know, I'm just showing Bob around. - Okay. - Is Mom feeding the holly? - [Jack] I don't know. - Anne. - [Anne] What? - [Paul] Are you feeding the holly? - Am I feeding the hungry? - The holly. - The holly, uh, yeah, go ahead and do what you want. Feed the holly, clip the forsythia, deadhead the roses, be my guest. - She's not feeding the holly. (doors closing) - Oh, who wants sprouts? - Yes, please. - Hi, Jack, sorry I'm late. - Hi, Maggie. - [Jack Voiceover] That Maggie did that, in front of everyone, was rather impressive. I was also hoping Mrs. Burka was just a teeny bit jealous. - [Paul] Mom and I worked together on that one. - Thank you. - Oh, it's beautiful. Did you make that? - I did. - I bet you did. - Thank you. - [Elaine] Oh you're welcome, I hope it fits. - I have one, it'll fit. (laughing) - [Elaine] There we go. - Here, open mine next. (soft music) That's my favorite. - See? Now I Know. Thank you. - You're welcome. - [Jack Voiceover] I wanted to thank everyone, but really I didn't. Because thank you is such an overused word. It means too many things, and at the same time, it means nothing. But one thing I did know was that I wanted to sit there until I became old enough to understand my life. (soft music) - Well, I think that went very well. - Yes, well, nothing fell on any one and no one choked, so they all seemed to have a good time. - My baby's 16 years old. 16, that makes me an old woman. - Can I go for a walk? - Go, go, go. Watch the leg. - Who says you're old? - I do. So are you. - [Jack Voiceover] I walked through the night alone, Jack singular. I'd always be my mother's Jack, and my father's Jack, and the Jack with the gay dad and Bob, and Michael and Max and Mrs. B. I'd always be all that, but more than that, I was myself. Jack, no strings attached. Whatever my family was or wasn't seemed to be getting less important. My life was my own now, and my job was to make it what I wanted it to be. I only wished I'd known that a couple of years ago. I was Jack, plain Jack, Jack out there all by myself. (dramatic music) Jack takes the pass, the announcer's voice boomed in my head. I ran unevenly across the court, wondering if my leg would ever be normal again. Or if my life would ever be normal again. Fast Jack is coming in low. I crouched down, dancing in and out. My leg felt like I was stepping on pushpins. (dramatic music) He's up, Fast Jack is up. I pushed through the pain. As the crowd roared, my leg didn't hurt. Nothing hurt, my mind was flowing. I was Fast Jack, and I knew I would make it and that everything would be okay. (upbeat music)
