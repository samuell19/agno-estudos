-You're going too fast. - Never too fast when we're going home. - We don't live in a tree. You hit it ! - Just brushed it. It's a great art ! - The police ! - Oh ! That's the limit. I should be applauded ! - Your hat! - For them ! I'm like St. Martin. - And the license number? - Let them keep it for the lottery. - You are truly crazy. - Come on, go ahead. You're making it through. - I know how to avoid accidents... ...this summer. If you bought me a yacht ? - What ? - There are bargains. Yes. Always Cannes, Biarritz, the casinos...It's a bore. We would always spend our vacations at sea. We wouldn't have one that was too small, so there'd be room for our friends. We'd spend the entire time in swimsuits and never get dressed. We'd look at the sky. We all loved each other... - Do you believe it? - My skin was brown, we'd sleep on deck... And I would never be cold. - Florence ! You see, it's nothing. - It was a close call. - Oh ! - What ? The lights are on. - I'm going to see. You ? But what's going on ? - Pardon me, M. Martel, I absolutely had to see you this evening. - Who is it? - The secretary. -He bores us, your secretary. - It's important. - Two minutes, my love. Well ? - M. Rolain has come from Lille. He asked for the receipts of his securities. The manager came in. I said that they could be found in your drawer. - What's wrong ? - M. Rolain complained, the manager wanted to open it. I protested. But it was a delicate situation. Finally he forced the lock and... - And the receipts weren't there. - You know that ? - Yes. They're in my drawer here. It's nothing tragic. - Oh, I thought... - You thought... You thought what ? - Martel. - My friend. A financier keeps his composure. To succeed, you have to stop panicking. So, good evening. Take it.The Echo de la Bourse will rock you to sleep. - What did he want? - The orders for tomorrow. - I don't know why you let yourself be bothered like that. - What do you want... I have to earn a living. Good news ? - The bills, always the bills. Are you worried? - Oh, no... - I can hardly wait until you belong to me. You know that tomorrow we're going to Fran?oise's. You promised me. - No. I'm going to Saint-Cloud, to my uncle's. - Your uncle's? - We have family matters to settle. - Naturally. And Fran?oise saved some marvelous summer fabrics for me. I would have loved you to see them. - How many fabrics? - Eight. - Eight ? - I have to dress on the yacht. - I thought that you had no need of clothing on the yacht! - Imbecile. - I've shown you the documents. It would be useless to deny the evidence. - That is not our habit. -Let us avoid such feelings. The 700,000 francs that your nephew misappropriated... - "Misappropriated." Perhaps these are unfortunate speculations. - As you wish. If I press charges, he will be arrested. - That wouldn't solve any of your problems. - We have the same interests. - Not the same interests. - We are not culpable... ...for the mistakes of our brother-in-law. - Nor am I ! - Pardon ? - Let's skip the pretty phrases. The money, or I'm going to press charges. It would be very well if it could all be managed so easily. - No anger. - No, no. If you prefer... ...that the Martels appear on the front pages of the papers, it's up to you. In your place... - We would have asked you for nothing. - Perfect, gentlemen. I'm leaving. I will expect an answer within 48 hours. Gentlemen. - Hey ! Do you want... Will you let go ! Johnny ! Beast, go ! Johnny ! Well... He's talking to the dog. - Pierre. Can you come ? Look... Your brothers-in-law and I have decided to assume your liabilities. We are doing so out of respect for the name you bear. - Even though you respect nothing. - We insist on only one condition. You must leave the country. Does that seem acceptable to you ? - There's nothing to discuss. - We are settling everything in exchange for your word. Well, answer me. - I give you my word. - Pierre. It's absurd ! It's not possible ! - Every day... ...I was hoping for a miracle. Today, it's over. - Come on. This is only a temporary problem. You... - No. Don't believe that. It's hopeless. So... I'm going to depart. For what godforsaken place ? I don't know yet , exactly. But far away, certainly. Oh ! You know, I'm not afraid. Myself, I can leave behind everything. But you... You understand. What strength! What courage I will have ! When it rains, you are there. When it's hot, you are there. Everything is gone, but you are there. Everything becomes easy and cheerful. Are you listening to me? - Yes. - Do you understand me ? You know, I will get by... Excuse me, that must be the hairdresser. Hello ? Oh ! It's you, Gis?le. Yes. Certainly, you can wear your red dress, I'll be in green. Very well. Good bye. See you soon. - What ? Are you intending to go to dinner ? - You're not ? - Oh, I... - You were hoping that I'd leave this evening for your backwater ? - No, evidently... - You have matters to settle. - I'm leaving in 48 hours. So ? - One doesn't leave without knowing where. - Are you refusing ? - I'm not saying that. I think that if you left first to arrange everything... Pierre. We love each other, all right. What you love is my way of helping myself to luxury. But yes, darling. When you see me wearing cheap dresses... ...I am certain that you will detest me. Without all of that I will be dead weight. - No. You will be the woman whom I need. - You're hurting me ! - It's all the same to me, but you must stay with me. - I'll rejoin you. - But when ? - When everything is arranged. Pierre. Be reasonable. I'm thinking of your interests as much as my own. I'm not reproaching you for the difficult situation in which you're placing me. - You're generous. - But no, Pierre. No. You'll return soon, I'll wait for you. - Don't trouble yourself. I understood quite well. - Pierre. - Farewell. - Pierre ! Don't leave like that ! - What is that ? - It's a coin from my country. True ! - Here's 100 sous. - How many cognacs ? - Four. - That, "table." - "Table." - Yes. This, "chair." - "Cheer". - No. "Chair." - "Chair." -Yes. That's good liquor. - No one asked you anything and you come. You're going to see kids, the life there. Ah ! Illness... the service. And the noncommissioned officers eat tiger at every meal. You're going to go through hell ! The camps, the column, the posts to build, the trails... With only fighting . - What ? - What is it ? You'll have the time to see that. When you've hoisted 75-mm gun for 3200 meters, we'll discuss it again. Ah, it's a rotten job ! - What are you doing to do in civilian clothes ? - Don't worry about me. When are you leaving ? - The day after tomorrow. - The day after tomorrow. On the Sel dal Piaze, a good ship. It'd be funny if you saw me turn up with a new contract. - You'd go through that again after what you said? - You're kidding - have you looked at me ? Go back, me? Ah ! Ah l? l?... - Water, please. - Gladly. - Thank you. - Pierre Muller. - Nicolas Yvanoff. - Are you familiar with Morocco ? - No, but I know Egypt well. I've traveled. And you ? - Yes. In Europe. - I know it well. Moscow, London, Athens... ...Paris ! - The most beautiful city, isn't it? - No argument there. - How much more, corporal? - 4 kilometers until the army camp. - Two months in the column without sores... ...and look, my ankle's starting to swell. - Ask for a mule. - So they send me to the infirmary ? I'm leaving tonight. - Fifteen days of leave, we're going to have a blow-out. And the girls have arrrived. - We'll have to hurry. - I think so. - Me, I'm going to drink a big glass of very cold beer. - What ? - I'm fed up ! - Don't play the fool ! - Mohamed, F?lix, Aicha ! Where is F?lix ? - I don't know. - The column is arriving ! Put some effort into it to make everything shine ! Check the bulbs. Clear out so we can clean up ! Tonight I want dresses ironed. You and Louise are going to have your hair done. There's no time ! This isn't a boarding house. - But what does have today ? - So, Mr. Civilian. Tonight, the column. - Who cares ! - Not me ! I'll be back in ten minutes. - It was so quiet ! - Hello. - Hello. - Well, Cl?ment ? - Well what ? - You've gone too far ! The women should've been here five weeks ago. - I can't help it. - You're laying it on thick ! What do they screw... ...in Barcelona ? - It's not easy to find a broad... ...who knows how to drink and all that! And who is an artist ! - I didn't have to hire you. I'm sticking to the contract ! I'm warning you... ...if in eight days no one is here, you're going to hear from me ! - You're going to sweat. - Madame Blanche ! I didn't see you. My compliments. - A drink ? - No, thank you. - A cigarette ? - Yes. A cigarette, yes. It's true ! I'm repainting my nightclub, but the women are the same. It's vexing ! The men are returning today. - After three months, they're going to be very difficult. - Are you doing your utmost ? - Don't believe that. A house changes its look. - Of course. You are as conversant in houses as I am in contraband. - I'm on the level. - Yes. - I paid twenty frances per head in advance ! I think that I have the right to be curious. - Don't shout, your temperature is going to rise. They're going to arrive, that's all. Excuse me, I'm going to feed my pigeons. - Your husband isn't very talkative. And his skin is yellow, lately. - It's the light. - Oh, the beautiful hands, like the great ladies of Florence. - Tiens ? - And what skin ! - Yes, it's the Normandie here, not the Parisian Follies. - Oh ! They're jokes. - Yes. - Jokes. - Yes. - My compliments. - Goodbye. - Has he left ? Bring me ice. Answer when I speak to you! Trash ! - Did 4 pay up ? And 7 ? Oh ! Sorry, we're filled up. Is 9 free ? - No, but 7's coming down. - Yes, that's right. Hurry, please. - Here we are ! - Finally. Oh ! Isn't it a pity ! Oh ! Turn around a little, so that I can see you. They're so brown ! It's a pleasure to see you, Pierre. Come a little closer. You don't look well. - Oh ! - You smell funny. - Sixty-three days without washing. - It's not that. - Yes. we wash ourselves with gasoline, that's what smells. - Ah, well ! - Do you have the keys ? - Yes. Here. - Has anyone touched the armoire ? - No one, lieutenant. - I will be the first. - Yes. Hurry up. - When I'm shaved, scrubbed, and dressed up, you'll see ! - And you ? How are you ? - Except that I'm thirsty. Half Pernod. - Half Mandarin. Was it tough out there ? - No more than usual. - They're going to make a racket tonight. - Oh ! Just a little for me. I only want to sleep. - Always the blues ? - And you ? - Oh, me ! - You're not having anything ? - That makes me ill. Then, it's even worse. - And your pills, are they better ? - I know... - The same thing. - Oh ! - Oh, in the name of God ! The moths ate my pants. Ah, what a mess ! The moths ! Look at this! There are a lot of them. Another moth ! Another one ! Another moth ! I opened the armoire to air it out. Close it when you leave. Don't forget to close it. - Oh ! I'm fed up ! Fed up ! Fed up ! I say: "Fed up !" - I hadn't heard. - I don't understand you. You - are you fed up, or not ? Yet I did the right thing. Yesterday I repaired the telephone line. That hisses as long as it can. I stroll around with my hands in my pockets. Nothing ! I light a cigarette... ...it lasts for a long time, my lighter doesn't work properly... Nothing ! When confronted with bastards, I piss. . . Still nothing ! The result. They're going to hold me up as an example and nominate me to be a sergeant! I'm a hero, Nicolas... Yes ! They take me for a hero ! - With your sergeant's pay... ...you can drink fine three-star liquor ! - Nicolas. - What ? - This lighter... ...it's she who gave it to me. It's she who brings me bad luck ! Are you crazy ? - That day... One day in autumn... She wore a dress, you know, a dress like... - Enough ! - What ? That doesn't interest you ? And you're my best friend... There are times when one would at least like... ...some advice. - Shut up ! I'm a friend on the condition that all that is not spoken of. It's agreed between us. I forbid you to question me. And even less to impose your confessions on me. You don't have the right. - Ah... the right ! - Perfectly. In coming here I bought the right to wipe the slate clean ! That's all. - And that's all... - I get on your nerves? Me? When I have the blues at work ! So ? - So ? Here. Pass me the bottle. What are you saying ? - I said that... Ah! I'm not saying anything ! - Hey ! Muller ! Are you inside ? - Yes. - Muller. I have that adjutant with a girl and don't have a place. - The adjutant. What I think of him... - As do I. But you'll do me a favor. Go for a walk. - I have a room so I can be undisturbed. Close the door, so I don't hear them anymore. - Go to Blanche's. She won't bother you. It's for one hour. Go on. I'll owe you one. Change the sheets. And clean up over here. - You can say that you know how to make our lives a misery ! - Here, your key. Get a move on ! Don't you know how to make a bed? Eh ? Go on ! What is it? - Will you read my cards ? - Yours ? - You read Nicolas', he told me. - Precisely. I don't want to do it anymore. - Why ? - Because I believe in it... - You do them well by yourself. - Oh yes ! But... ...what's going to happen to me... I don't care so much. - If you think that I'm attached to something... - Go on. Sit there. - You're kind. - Oh ! Listen, no. You smell of liquor ! - Me ? You're joking ! - Sit down, you're going to fall. Go ahead, cut. The other hand. Toward you. So... shall I do the full deck for you ? - Bah... while we're on the subject. Go for the full deck ! You know, I'm not afraid. I'm ready to hear everything. Ah... the night, the chance... In my house, a woman... without abandoning you. A man from the country under a pile... And to my mind, a brunette... ...who loved me with all her heart. - She was blonde and she did not love you. - Where do you see that ? - There, you see? She turns her back to you, and you look at her. Do you still love her ? - Me ? - Don't lie. - Oh, if you insist. Tell me... I will see her again ? - If you speak... - Good. I'll be silent. - One, two, three, four, five. You have an injury, but it's a flesh wound. Or a slight illness. However, it's not serious. One, two, three... ...four, five. This woman, you will see her again. - What ? Here, or in Europe ? - It is she who will come to you, by the road, there. - By the road ? - I see a good period for you. Yes - a period of love. - With her ? - I don't know. One, two, three, four, five. Ah, yes. But that will not last. Separation. - Ah ? - It's odd... It looks as if all your problems derive from you. One, two, three, four, five. You are going to receive an amount of money. - Ah ! - Important ! - That, that would amaze me. -The money is there. - He would like it in his pocket. - Cover your cards. Yes. Cover that one for me. That one. - Look. - So, this woman, you will surely see her again. - Ah ? -Cover that one for me. There it is. The disease, which returns. Son... ..you have to watch your health. - Tell me then, will I die soon ? - No. - You don't want to say. - But no ! Listen. Death is the nine of spades... ...next to the nine of diamonds. It's not there. - The nine of spades next to the nine of diamonds ? - Cover the problem for me. A serious problem... It looks as if you're going to kill a man. You're going to kill a brown-haired man. - What ? - If you start to believe that, you'll never stop. Blanche told me that I would be killed by a blond man. Ah ? Maybe it's you ! It's you who's going to kill me ! Good old Blanche ! Give us something to drink, I owe him a round. - I'm going to get some air. - Let him be, he's drunk enough. - Until tomorrow. And thanks ! - Help ! - A legion to help me ! A legion for me ! For me! Stop ! - Corporal Muller. - Corporal Muller. - Corporal Muller. I mention you in the dispatches to the battalions, and then you cause these problems ? Two sharpshooters in the hospital ! Were you drunk ? - Yes. - I give you eight days.. And that's not a lot. I proposed you for the rank of sergeant. - Colonel... I don't want it. - Why ? - I'm fine where I am. - You don't want a sergeant's stripes ? You'll do 15 days. Muller. You will give your clothes to the tailor so he can sew on the stripes. Understood ? - Yes, colonel. - Where to ? - The Follies. - Too bad he's in prison ! - We laughed. - I'll be finished tonight. - Ah ! And you ? - Eight more hours. - Oh, pal ! There's been a delivery of cute girls ! You know. And all dressed up ! They say there are singers from Paris. Attention ! - It smells of tobacco. Do you smell it ? - No, monsieur. - Have you searched ? - Yes, monsieur. - Raise your right arm. I advise you to keep your eyes open, corporal. - Pass me the matches. So, lucky devil. Whom are you going to have a tumble with ? - One never knows. - Oh, that ! I'm happy ! - Louder ! - Don't bellow so much. - Not first-rate. - They don't want it. There's nothing to be done. She's sad. Be quiet, here she comes. - Not you... - Shut up ! Ladies and gentlemen... ...the final number. By popular demand.. ...Dauville in her repertoire. - Chopin, go ahead. "I'm Not Like Them." Work yourself up, cutie ! "There are complicated women, With whom it's hard to get started" "There are distinguished ladies, who want to be treated like whores" "Others need to be drugged With champagne or cocaine" "Others need to be beaten" "All those women are cold bitches" "Me, I'm not at all like them" "When a guy looks at me, straight in the eye" "And touches me in a certain way" "In two movements, I rise up to heaven" "I make a fresh start easily And you, over there?" "And you ?" "Oh, it's a shame !" "What's important when leaving on a trip" "Is that the woman doesn't arrive late" "What's important when leaving on a trip" "Is that the woman doesn't arrive late." - The song of the kid Dauville. - Ah ! - You're going to see that.. What a pair of boobs ! I'm not going to choke on the dregs. - Hey, Blanche. Another. - Aichouch ? Aichouch ! What on earth is she doing ? Where are you going like that ? - I want to talk to you. - She's cheeky! - I want my money. I'm leaving. - Why ? - Monsieur is a pig. One time, yes, it's not too much. Every day, no. It's not my job. - You know. . . I'm going to clear out. - Oh ! You're in a hurry ! The Trouville kid's waiting for you. - Dauville. - Trouville, Dauville... - Let's go. - As long as we drink ! - You could say good evening. - Just one round. - Try not to come back with 15 days. - Don't worry. - Sergeant. Are you one leave ? It's for those who've been granted leave. - Gar?on ! Brandy. And you ? - Brandy. - Two brandies. - There she is. She has a great figure ! - Hello, my darling. How are you ? - My friend. The friend ! Our friend ! - So you're the one who throws people out of windows... ...and makes them hang from chandeliers ? - You've been advertising me ! - He speaks only of you. Corporal Muller ? - Sergeant. - Oh, pardon me. - So. What do you think of him ? - Not talkative. - Huh ? - Not talkative. Is he alright ? But yes. -But no. - Gar?on ! A glass of water. - Is he often like this ? - He's thinking. It's his temperament. - I see. It's still crazy ! - Hey. Do you have... Do I seem drunk to you? - But no, why ? - Ehh...no reason. Manager ! Manager ! - What is it ? - That woman, there. Who is she? - That one ? Nice. But nothing special. Only good for civilians. - Tell her to come. - As you wish. Irma. - You're taking her away from us ? - Just for a minute. - Is it you who asked for me ? - No. It was me. - Ah ! Delighted, monsieur. So ? May I sit down ? - If you wish. - Are you well ? Maybe it's the heat ? Are you going to offer me a drink ? - If you wish. Gar?on ! - A ros?. I have headache pills. This music is nice. Do you come here sometimes ? - Listen. Stay a minute... without talking. - Without talking ? - Yes. Yes... ...for a moment. - Pardon me, sir. Madame is coming with us. - And then ? - We hired her. Leave her. - Anything goes, eh! - He's a drunk. - I'm not going to let myself be walked over. Let me be ! - Come on ! Take it easy ! Go and sit down. I'm going to take care of it. - Let's go ! - Come on, sergeant ! - No one. . . ! - All right. Is it serious ? Sit down. And look. - Come on. Get me the same thing. - Here you are. - Well, suckers.. So now you're married. Come on ! Let's be merry ! - Be merry ! - Let's embrace! - I'll be happy to. What's more, the customs officer isn't interesting. What's your name ? - Don't speak. - Ah ! What a funny guy you are, even so ! - Let me go. - What would it take ? - Don't worry, he's a legionnaire. - Pierre ? Hey, Muller ! Muller ! - Nicolas. What are you doing? - Listen. I think I'm going crazy. - Indeed. - All that matters is that I see her again. - That's not hard. - Only... I want to see her just once. - It's not difficult. - Here. Arrange it with her. What are you waiting for? - Are you certain? - Hurry. - A what ? Oh... At this hour, it's not convenient. Well, I'll go to see her. - So, where are we going ? - To your place ? - If you wish. - I'll follow you. Where are you from ? - Barcelona. - And before that? - Bordeaux. - And before that? - What difference does it make ? - Why don't you answer ? - I'd like to, but I don't know, exactly. - You don't want to say ! What do you want ? - It's nothing. - It looks like scar from a bullet. - Yes. - You don't remember ? - I prefer not to think about it. You're not going to sleep ? Come on, then. - When you were wounded were you very sick ? - I was told that I was. - You couldn't tell ? - No. I had a high fever. It seems that I called someone to help me. - Who ? - Why aren't you in bed ? When one has worked a lot... Oh, if I fall asleep... - Do you know Paris ? - No. - Are you certain ? And a quarter with gardens and trees ? Neuilly. You don't know it either? Obviously, you're from Bordeaux. You're certain that you come from Bordeaux ? - I told you that I was going to fall asleep. Darling, come and kiss me. I'm not going to talk, ch?ri. Because that's what you like. It's ready. - Ah, thank you. - Two ? - Yes, yes. - You know, I spend very little on myself. Here. I already have 2200 francs. - Ah. Well ? - It's not much. But... - That's right. Hand me my jacket. - No. I didn't mean that. What's your name ? - Pierre. - Pierre... - Yes. - I'm Irma. You know that I don't have a man. He's in prison. I told you that night. Well... - What ? - Well... Pierre. If you wanted, we could get together. - Why ? - But I thought... - Why with me? - But... - Huh ? Why do you say that? - You said that night... - Me ? But what did I say ? - Many words. - And what ? - I don't know anymore. - What ? Good. - Sweet words. - Crap, yes. - Well ? You don't want to ? - No, I don't want to. Really? Here. - It will be taken care of. - Come on. He said yes ? What ? So. What did he say? - He said no. Half-heartedly. I can hear from here Aziani's sales pitch. The travel expenses,the dresses... - Yes. Is it a lot ? - Around 4000. - Good grief! I'll never have that much. - I can lend you the difference, I have a stash. -Say, are you crazy? I'll ask Nicholas, he has it. - Well of course. - So it's yes? - No ! - It's you who changes his rubles for him. - Well. . . Don't worry. It's all the same. - You're nice. I love you . - Oh really ? - Yes. I love you like a mother. - Yes. Oh... a son like you ! - But look ! - In any case, she'll be fine here, this girl. You know that by Saturday you'll be calm. Are you happy ? - I don't know. - What ? Is that still nagging at you? - I don't know. - You're finally over Florence. Irma pleases you as she is ! So, so? You can say that you're an easy-going type ! What'll it be ? - A Pernod Suze. - Good. - There's no one here. - Weekdays... - Yes, it's quiet. - Ah, for calm ! - I owe you ? - 22 et 26. 46 sous. - How many ? - 48. - Here you are. - Thank you, monsieur. Goodbye, gentlemen. See you. Are you eaitng ? - No. - Aren't you well ? - Isn't he coming ? - I don't know. - Hey, Muller ! Aren't you eating ? - No. I'm not hungry. Good night . - He has what ? - What does that have to do with you ? - Oh... after all ! Here, pass me the beans. - No, thank you. - You're not eating ? - I'm done. - If you want to go upstairs... - Good night. - Good night. - Charming atmosphere ! - Do you want a drink ? - Does that upset you ? - It's for you. Are you annoyed ? Things have been arranged for our comfort. The others don't know. I am very happy. - Are you bored ? - No. The day is long, but I'll wait for you. It's too hot... ...you're going to come. It's raining... ...you're going to come. - But... Who said these words to you ? - No one. - Listen, Irma. we don't forget who we are ! - So ? - Remember ! - I can't. - You can't ! You might want to take your revenge ! So ? Are you ashamed ? - No, my dear. When you were left alone life became difficult... ...and then, you were out of your depth. And then the bad luck, the disgust... ...then, you slid, slid... Tell me that that's it. - Yes, my dear. - This bullet, is this what you wanted to kill yourself with ? What? What, that's it? Admit that you remember ! Are you going to answer me ? - Careful. The balustrade doesn't hold well. - Are you listening at doors now ? - Don't act like an idiot. Go in. And don't worry about it anymore. - I'll worry about it if I want ! - Are you still crying ? - No. It's over. - Did I hurt you ? - No. - What ? But don't be afraid, Irma. I'm not mad ! No, no. No, I... I like you, you know. - Oh ! - Yes, yes ! - Do you love me as I am? - Yes, yes. Yes. As you are. - If you're unhappy with me... ...I can leave. - I need you. - Really ? - I beg your forgiveness. Do you understand, Irma ? I want you to be happy ! - And then he even said to me: "I want you to be happy." - You see ! Push back the skin before cutting it. Like that. - I want him to be happy, too ! I would have earned more at the Follies. Well, no. He wants me only for himself. - Look. - I'm afraid of his questions and don't know what he wants from me ! - Like all man, he wants you to be brainwashed. - Blanche ! - Yes ? - No mineral water ? - Nothing this week. Thank you. As you wish. Since you're certain that he pleases you and cares about you, Just speak like he does. Leave him to his dreams without upsetting him. That way... he won't torment himself anymore and will heal. - Not easy. - Indeed. - Besides, it won't lead to anything good... ...talking about the past. - He is proud ! - Why doesn't he love me like that? - That will happen little by little. Soon it won't make a difference, and he won't talk about it anymore. In the meantime he wants you to have known Paris. So know it ! - I lived there. - You see. It's not complicated. Her name is Florence. Who knows, with a name like that ! Well... An apartment where everything was chic... ...jewels. - Green stones. - Ah ? I don't know that. Masses of dresses... A major furrier, a couturier... - An enormous car, completely green. She loved green. - Ah ? What odd taste ! But how do you know that ? Know that she had a green car ? - He must have said so. - Ah ? - So, my friend Gustin. This column ? You're in this one? - I'd like to find out that I'm not ! - Are you happy ? - Happy, happy. The doctor told me I was unfit to campaign. Do you realize ? Me, Gustin, unfit ! Maybe because I'm old... ...or have diarrhea... Good lord, good lord...unfit ! I'm going to see the old man, he knows what I'm capable of. I don't mind telling him. What enables a legionnaire to endure is his morale. Do you see ? - Forward. Attention. - First bugler, Gustin. - Well, Gustin ? - Colonel, I protest. I protest with all my might . If there is no longer any justice in the legion, where is there any ? - Approach. What's wrong ? -It's only that I don't want to be left behind with the idlers. No more of that! Before one was never asked if we were fit or unfit ! Even when you were wounded. It was death that relieved you of your service. - Well, me, 17 years of service as first bugler... ...I want... Well, I ask... Well, if it was possible, colonel...? - And I ? Yes, I. Do you think it amuses me to stay here, in the middle of all this ? Only, the new arrivals have to be trained. Who will pass along the esprit du corps to them if the veterans are no longer here? - So that's why... - Yes. I heard the new buglers, there's still a lot of work to do. Try to break them in and teach them the spirit ! - For that, colonel... - Good. You can arrange it. Cl?ment. Did you ask for the report through official channels? - Colonel, it's... - You will have it for me in four days. - Colonel. - Hey, Gustin ! So ? Are you going ? - No, it's impossible. The old man needs me. - Would you pass me the other one ? - I want ice in my room. - Your room ? - Yes. I'm telling you ! - A little white wine ? - I wouldn't say no. Oh l? l? ! A?e, a?e, a?e ! - Oh ! Irma ! Irma ! And you, do you want one? No ? - To your health, Blanche ! - And to yours. Irma ! - Today that can count as a course. To think that we still have a month left of this ! - Of what ? - There's still a month left of heat. - Oh, probably ! - Let's go, goodbye. Thanks. - Yes. - Say hello to the owner. - Thank you. Irma ? Irma ? - What ? She'll come down. - Oh ! - Hello ! What ? - Oh, for example ! - Did I frighten you ? - You startled me ! - Ah ? - What's the matter ? - We're leaving tonight as a reinforcement, and it seems to be getting hotter. - Ah ? - I've come up with a scheme for you to see Irma. - A glass ? - Is she there ? - Certainly. You're not having anything ? - No, thank you. Where is she ? - I was in the cellar where the bottles are delivered. I... She must be upstairs, I'll go and see. - Cl?ment ? - Cl?ment ? - Yes. - He's shaving. Sit down a minute. I'm going to look upstairs. - No, I'm going. - It's OK. - I'm going ! - What's gotten into you ? Pierre, you're crazy ! Pierre ! Don't do anything foolish ! Pierre ! Pierre ! - Cl?ment ! Don't do anything foolish ! They're arguing. - Go, you bastard ! - Pierre ! Hou l? ! - Oh ! What did you do ? - And you! - He threatened me! - Why didn't you say anything ? - This is what would've happened. - Come on. - Come on. Sit there. Don't move and let me deal with it. Fix your hair ! You, too. And not a word. Help! My husband has fallen ! - Where ? - He fell from the first floor. A doctor ! - He fell ? - Yes. In the courtyard. Where can we find a doctor ? - Oh, a doctor, come on ! Quickly, we need a doctor. - Because of the balustrade ! - What balustrade ? - It doesn't hold. - I didn't remember that. He knew it, though ! - The balustrade gave way. - Such a height ! Here. It was rotten. - Yes... - It had to happen. He was always drunk. - Let's go, madame Blanche. He's at peace now. With his diseased liver, he wouldn't have had very long. At least he didn't suffer. Don't cry like that. - Does anyone know why we cry ? - Hello. I miss Jean Pierre. - Another one messed up. - They're not happy with our routes. What do they need ? - Our hides ! The land. - Nothing grows there. - The land ! It was something else... - This task will involve a corporal, a sergeant, and ten light infantrymen. No rotation is planned; I need volunteers. - Me. - We'll start off with the sergeant. - Me. - Sergent Weil. Caporal Yvanoff. The infantrymen -- will you get them? Or do I appoint them ? - You have to choose those who aren't. - You have one hour. That's all. - Well ? Are you happy with your men? - You bet ! They won't dawdle. - You know... Just a moment ago, if I didn't answer, it's because... - I understood. Now that you have someone in your life... A happy legionnaire is no longer a legionnaire. Everyone knows that. - They are well entrenched. - Otherwise it wouldn't have been amusing. Goodbye. - I should have come. - Another time ! - At my order, forward ! - How he groused, that poor Nicolas... The very idea that we could touch his armoire ! Here. Here. A horse ? - His horse... What is that ? - Soil. - Soil ? - Soil... - And old Russian newspapers. And old rubles. That's all. Are we leaving? - Yes. - I'm going. Do you have enough to drink ? - Yes, thank you. - Look. Look, there. - Who was he, there ? Rebel ? Artist ? Criminal ? - We could have that translated. - No. - I'd like to keep this. - No. Nothing. He bought the right to wipe the slate clean. - Do you believe that ? - Yes. He always said as much. - When he died... ..he said nothing ? - He said: "I don't care !" - He died... intentionally ? - Oh ? I don't believe so. - Without seeming so... ...he may have been the most unhappy among us. - But... what do you know about it ? He never spoke of it. Never... - Yes. - Pardon. So ? You're not in any hurry to hear the news ? - You told me to wait. - And if I changed my mind. Eh ? If I said nothing to you. - You would have had your reasons. - You have so much confidence in me. - Am I wrong ? - Here. Read. "I have the honor to inform you... "...that the last will and testament..." He's dead ? Is that painful for you ? - Oh, you know, my uncle was old, 70, 72 years... But read it ! "The sum - " I don't see very well. "The sum of 5... 5000... "...500..." - "550,000 francs." - 550,000 francs ? To you? - Yes, to me ! - So, you're going to leave ? - We're going to leave. - We ? - Yes ! It's our delivrance ! - He's really dead ? - We'll see ! Listen, Irma. Forty-two more days and I'll have finished my five years. Farewell, pals ! Farewell, Normandie ! In Casablanca there is... ...a great ship that's going to depart... And on the deck... ...you don't see anything ? You don't see anything ? - Yes. But I love it when you explain it to me! - Well, there's a woman and a man who are happy. What ? What is it ? - Pierre. It's too beautiful coming all at once. - Yes. Oh ! Well, provisionally... - I think it's very fine. You look like a gentleman. - I'm going to pick up our tickets. And you? -I'm going to a fitting. - See you soon. - 2045 francs. Two basic first-class tickets. Your vouchers. - We leave at 6 ? - Yes, tomorrow at 6 p.m. - Martel ! Martel ! Pierre ! How amazing ! I thought you were dead. - Florence ! - You're not ashamed... ...to have vanished without a word, wihout a postcard! Jerry. Let me introduce Pierre Martel, an old friend. You surely know... ...his excellency, the pasha Djebel Adad. Pierre ! You are in splendid shape. You haven't changed ! You've filled out, it suits you. We have to see each other. No ? Are you staying ? - Several days - Let's see. Tomorrow is Tuesday. Are you free at 11 ? I am his guest. It will be delightful to see you again. Until tomorrow. You'll tell me everything. Goodbye. Come, dear friend. Bye-bye ! - This is very dressy. It's for dining on a ship. Do you like the pearls ? It's missing one but it doesn't show. They reduced the price for me, 100 francs. You don't like them ? - Oh, yes. - Really ? - Oh yes. - I was so afraid. - Everything is very good. - No ? And then... ...I also thought of you. Do you like it ? - Yes. Very nice. - Are you hot ? Are you tired ? -No, I... I have a problem. A little problem. I have our tickets but not the documents. I have to take care of that. I don't know if they'll be ready in time for our departure. - We'll leave later. - But the tickets will no longer be valid. You see, I'd prefer that only one go to waste. - Ahh... You want me to leave alone. -Yes, and then I... ...will come two or three days later. I'll meet up with you in Marseille. - Of course... yes. - So, what have you been up to ? - I, you know... It's all very ordinary. - You finally succeeded. - Quite a bit... - Do you have plans ? - I had them. But... - I never had any worries about you. You're resourceful. - I haven't changed. No... I haven't changed at all. Nor have your eyes. Nor has your smile. - I haven't had any complaints about my life. Sometimes I get a little bored. But that's not serious. - Perhaps you wouldn't be bored anymore if you followed me . - Where ? - Wherever you wish. Like the old days ! You waited for me at home, and here I am! - But... I'm not at home. - Listen, Florence. Now that you're here in front of me, I can see clearly. For me it's all easy and nothing matters but you. I am certain. I can live only with you, or alone. Or... Not at all ! - That's very nice to hear... but life has moved on. - I have money ! - Yes. And one evening at the slighest sign of boredom... ...you'll announce there's nothing left, and you'll disappear.. - At least... - I had to get through this scandal alone. If you had loved me... - Be quiet ! I did everything for you ! Ask them if I ever complained... When I believed I would find you again, I thought I'd go mad. - What ? - Yes. Those days, those nights... ...seeking your face. You can't understand, but I know. It's for you that I accepted everything. - You're frightening me. - Yes... For you, I stole... For you, I killed a man. For you, I sacrificed the only one who loved me. Is that too little ? - Killing, sacrificing... Sacrificing who ? The African sun did not make a success of you. I hoped to find you reasonable. I wanted to offer you my friendship. - Your friendship ! I no longer want it. - I thought . . . ...that my friends could be useful. - No, no. Don't bother them. Florence. To see you... ...for a minute... ...there... What wouldn't I have done ! Now, you are here, in front of me... It's funny. And I don't care ! And I'm going to leave contentedly. You no longer interest me. I don't regret anything ! - Pierre ! - Bye, then ! - Excellent service. An excellent service record. I hope your next five years will be as brilliant ! Your itinerary. You leave for Marrakesh tomorrow at 8pm. - Captain. - Well, Muller. I can only congratulate you. You didn't remain a civilian very long. - No. - I know... When work is in one's blood... - Yes, captain. - Thursday, Friday... Saturday ... You may be able to arrive before Sunday! - Yes. Give or take a day or two. Look. Be careful. - Will you look after yourself ? - Yes. Here, open your bag. - So much ? - I'd perfer not to keep it on me. You take care of it. Thats's an order. - Yes. I put the keys to the trunks and the tickets here. When I arrive, I'll unpack everything. - You found it ! - Here it is. - Everything that vanishes turns up ! Here's another ! - And another ! - Do you realize ? You have four aces! What a marvelous success ! - Don't laugh ! There's some truth there. - There's no girl. - Well. I'm through with girls ! - You don't miss them ? - The one who laughs and the one who cries. The first had a great figure. And off she went ! And the second... I don't know who she was. - She was nice. Oh l? l? ! Leave me in peace. Let's be happy! - Ha ! Ha ! - Hey. - Careful, you won't be able to march . - Don't worry ! I arranged it with my driver. Yes. At the corner, I jump in the truck. Now, I'd start a fight in a taxi. - Oh, no! I'm drunk. - And you'll be on the floor ! - No, no. Let's go. No. Let's see. - So, what's next ? - Well, you're going to receive a medal. - You interest me... - You're going to do something amazing. Something extraordinary.. that will be talked about ! - And then? - And then... I had too much to drink, I no longer see clearly. And besides, all of it means nothing. - Do you think I didn't see it ? The 9 of spades next to... - No, I'm telling you, I was wrong. I was wrong about everything. About. . .about the medal and your marvelous success. - It's funny... In my hand, it's written that I'll live for a hundred years. - That's all that's true. Show me ? You will end up in a car. - That you'll be driving slowly. - To take you to the bistro, you old drunkard ! - Old bag ! - Already ? - Yes... It's getting light. - Leave by the courtyard, it's closed. - So. . .I have to go and earn my medal. - It's all wrong ! - Yes. Of course.. Hey, tell me. You have nothing to say to them, to Schleus ? No ? I'll send you postcards. - Listen ! It's better not to always play the fool. Goodbye... Be careful. - Don't worry.
