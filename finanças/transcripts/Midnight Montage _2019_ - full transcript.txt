(glass shatters) (sinister orchestral music) (thunder claps) (eerie music) (fire crackles) (thunder claps) - Good evening, children. My name is Madame Lavinia, and welcome to the Midnight Montage. An anthology of nightmares, dealing with hell's deadly secrets and dastardly doings. Let's see what the cards have in store for us tonight. Are you ready? (thunder claps) Are you sure? It's time for our first descent into darkness. Ah! The inheritance. (thunder claps) (laughs ominously) (somber piano music) - [Paperboy] Morning! (coffee splashes) (distant rhythmic thuds) (woman sighs) (rhythmic thuds) - [Woman] Okay, Grandma. Some nice coffee for you. Just take a sip. - Thank you, Elizabeth. - How are you feeling today? - I think I'm good. (somber orchestral music) (horn bonks) (phone chimes) - Gran, my friends are downstairs. I'll be right back, okay? - Okay, Elizabeth. - Okay. Hey. - How're you doing, Eli? - I'm fine. It still hurts. - [Connor] Look, we're going to fish camp later. - Let me think about it. It's hard with my grandmother. I really can't leave her alone. - [Connor] Well, if you decide, we'll be there at six-ish. - Okay, guys. - Bye. - See ya. (door creaks) (door closes) (distant rhythmic thuds) (rhythmic thuds) (door closes) (distant rhythmic thuds) Jesus. I'm coming, Grandma. (distant thud) I'm coming! (sighs) Sorry about that. - What took you so long? - [Elizabeth] I've been busy. Here. - I don't like it. - It's good for you. You've gotta eat something, Grandma. (Grandma coughs) (tense orchestral music) Oh, my god! (gasps) Granny! Gran! (rhythmic thuds) (Grandma coughs) (sobs) Oh, no! (sobs) (somber orchestral music) I'm so sorry, Grandma! (sobs) (suspenseful music) Okay. It was an accident. Nobody has to know. (sighs) (upbeat music) ♪ It was cold and snowy ♪ ♪ The road was winding and long ♪ ♪ And the sign read if you die today ♪ ♪ Do you know where you'll go ♪ ♪ No, we had no destination ♪ - Hey! ♪ Journey felt so right ♪ ♪ Was my first ♪ ♪ Christmas in white ♪ ♪ There's a light in the darkness ♪ ♪ And the darkness ♪ ♪ Shall not overcome ♪ ♪ There's a light in the darkness ♪ ♪ And the darkness ♪ ♪ Shall not overcome ♪ ♪ It was a long time coming ♪ ♪ Too many years I regret ♪ ♪ All the joy we missed out on ♪ ♪ The wars we now choose to forget ♪ - [Man] I really had a great time with you tonight. Unfortunately, it was under these circumstances. - Yeah, I, I can't believe it's been 12 months since parents passed. - Time flies, but I tell ya, there's ever a time you need to talk or want to go out. - Yeah, I'd like that. - Have a good night. (car door closes) (dark orchestral music) (sirens wail) (sobs) (distorted radio chatter) - So, one more time. You made your grandmother dinner, porridge, and she was okay when you left? - [Elizabeth] Yeah. (sighs) - Do you know how old she was, approximately? - [Elizabeth] She was 82. - Okay. (Elizabeth sobs) (dark orchestral music) - I'll be right back. - I'll stay with her. (door creaks) (door closes) (suspenseful orchestral music) (Elizabeth sobs) (door creaks) - The medical examiner's gonna take it from here. - Okay. - We'll be in touch. - If you can think of anything else, don't hesitate to call us, okay? - [Elizabeth] Thank you. (sobs) (door creaks) (door closes) (ominous tones) (rain splashes) - "For as much as it hath pleased Almighty God of his great mercy to take unto himself the soul of our dear sister here departed, we therefore commit the body to the ground. Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust." (dark orchestral music) "Dust to dust. In sure and certain hope of the Resurrection to eternal life through our Lord, Jesus Christ. That it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working." (dark orchestral music) (rain splashes) - Elizabeth, I'm so sorry for your loss. - Connor, thank you. (background chatter) - Grandma's gotta be hiding the booze somewhere. (chuckles) - Hey, found the glasses! - Nice! - [Man] Hey, jackpot! (chuckles) - Very nice. - Oh. Holy shit. (drain hums and rattles) Dude, it wasn't even plugged in. (dark orchestral music) - Let's get the fuck outta here. But not without the vodka. - Hey, guys, look what I found. Father. - Good morning, my son. Thank you for joining us. - Oh, yes. - Praise the Lord the rain has stopped. - That was a great service, wasn't it? - It was a beautiful service. - Yeah. (priest mumbles) - [Man] It does, it does. - I believe the sun's coming out later. It's supposed to warm up. - Praise the Lord for holding the weather for us. (background chatter) (somber music) (Elizabeth sighs) (Elizabeth groans) - Elizabeth! Elizabeth, what did I do? - Really, Steve? A Ouija board? And in front of Father Murphy? - I was just trying to lighten the mood. (Elizabeth sighs) Do you want me to tell these guys to leave? - Yes! Get them them out of here! (Elizabeth pants) - [Man] Give me that ticket, it's like a $250 ticket. And I was like, "man, I'm not trying to spend $1,000 to go over there only to..." - [Woman] Yeah. - [Man] That's why I got outta there. Yeah. (group laughs) - [Man] Hey, she'll tell you. I'm the cheapest guy you'll ever meet. (group talks over each other and laughs) - Well, anyways. (Elizabeth mumbles) - We're all out of gin. - Dave, there's a whole bottle of vodka right there. - Ah, you know I'm a gin man. Always a gin man. - I'm sorry, guys. What a dick. - And you love my dick. (Steve laughs) - Gin, gin, gin. Come on, Grandma. I know you got gin in here somewhere. - And that's how it ended. (laughs) - Hey! It's party time! (suspenseful music) - No fucking way. - Hell yeah. I'm down to play with a Ouija board. - No. Put it back. - I'm in. - I don't know, guys. I'm with Elly. We should leave the dead, dead? - I used one once before, and I heard you can invite the wrong spirit. - How many scenes of Exorcist have you guys watched? This is fine. Let's play! - What... What can really go wrong with a board game? - We need a paper and pen. - I'll get it. - Here, I'll write it. - [Connor] All right, everybody put your hands on. - [Elizabeth] This is ridiculous. - Is anyone there? G. E. T. O. U. T. - [Woman] "Get out." Get out? - I told you guys, this is a bad idea. - B. E. D. R. O. O. M. D. R. A. W. E. R. - [Woman] It says "my bedroom drawer." - Well, there's only one way to find out. Who wants to come with me? - (chuckles) Not me. - Not me. - [Woman] Count me out. (suspenseful music) - I told you this was a bad idea. - He's got bigger balls than me. - This is getting way too freaky. - Yeah. - Well, well, well. Don't the spirits tell the truth. (eerie string music) (Elizabeth sighs) - "My dearest Elizabeth. I am so grateful to you for everything you have done since your parents passed. I know it has been very difficult for you not socializing with your friends. I received news today that it's a matter of weeks before I join your parents. So I've prepared my will. Contact Jason Williams, Attorney at Law on Main Street. You will taken well care of. My house, car and what little savings I put away for this day will be yours. You can sell the house, move to LA, and continue your dream to be an actress. I only wish I could be there to see you on the silver screen, but I will look down on you, cheering you on, as well as your parents. I have also made my funeral arrangements with Father Murphy, so you don't have to worry about anything. Oh, my sweet granddaughter, until we meet again. Live a long and happy life. Love always, Granny Elizabeth." - So now that you got your inheritance, you wanna change out the hunker junker in the front yard? - Dave! Once a car salesman, always a car salesman. (Elizabeth sobs) - Can you guys just go? I need to process all this. (sobs) - Guys, I think that's gonna be enough for today. I think Elizabeth needs a little bit of time to herself. Let's go. - Elly, I'll call you tomorrow. - Okay. - Bye. (car starts) (eerie orchestral music) (ominous orchestral music) (distant sobbing) (door closes) (distant sobbing) (suspenseful orchestral music) (muffled scraping) (distant clock chimes melodically) (distant clock chimes rhythmically) (chair creaks) (drain hums and rattles) (Elizabeth breathes deeply) - Why? (Elizabeth screams) (muffled screams) (intense string music) (detective grunts) (muffled sobs) (eerie tones) (ominous music) (gun fires rapidly) (thunder claps) - (sighs) Naughty girl. Remember! Be nice to your grandparents, or they might pay you a visit! And now, for our next adventure... (gasps) You're all invited! To a block party. (thunder claps) (somber piano music) - More coffee? - No, thank you, I'm fine. - Oh, well, you look exhausted. - [Son] Mom, did you wash my blue shirt? - Yes, I did! Look in your closet! - [Son] Thanks! - I am exhausted and it looks like another long night, too. - Well, if you weren't such a wonderful doctor, you wouldn't be in such demand. - We have football practice today after school. I was thinking about going to Ted's afterwards. Well, we both have that science project we have to do together. - Okay, well try not to make it too late, okay? - [Son] We won't. We're probably gonna get burgers or a pizza. So don't worry about dinner. - Speaking of dinner. What have you planned for the block party? - I don't have anything yet, and if I don't come up with something soon, I won't have anything for tomorrow. - What's happening tomorrow? - Block party, remember? - Oh, yeah. - Try not to sound so enthusiastic. - It'll be fun. Besides, it's nice to spend some time with the neighbors. - I'm looking forward to it. - That's just 'cause there's gonna be food there. - And what's wrong with that? - Mom! - Brad, stop that. No more annoying your sister until you're 30. - Can I spend the night at Peggy's tonight? I promise I'll be back in time for the block party. - I'm being abandoned. Yes, you can. Actually, since I'll be spending my time slaving away the stove, it's probably good that you're all out of the house for the evening. - What're you making? - (chuckles) I don't have a clue. Which is why there's that stack of cook books over there. - Well, whatever it is, I'm sure it will be delicious as always. Well, I have a 9AM surgery. Anybody need a lift to school? - Yep! - Me, too. Thanks, Dad. (footsteps clack) (somber orchestral music) (door creaks) - I'll call you later. Love you. - Okay, I love you too. (car starts) Bye! (horn honks) (engine roars) - Hey, neighbor! - [Mother] Hi! Do you need help? - No, I'm all set. I just picked up a few things for the block party tomorrow. - Oh, I still don't have a clue what I'm taking. - Bob and I are making hamburgers. They're always a big hit with the kids. And Mrs. Richie's making lasagna. I hear it's delicious. - (sighs) You know, it'll be nice to see everybody. I feel like all we do is wave hi and goodbye to each other for the rest of the year. - It'll be great to get together to gossip. - (laughs) Nothing ever happens around here. - Ain't that the truth. Well, I gotta go organize my stuff. I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. See you then. Oh! Uh, the cupcake recipe. Can you get it to me? - Sure, I'll drop it by later. - Perfect, thank you. Bye. - Bye. (bottles clink) - Can I help you there, Julie? - Oh, hi, Cliff. No, I've got it. Thank you, though. (dog barks) Wow, I don't think I've ever heard him bark that much. - Oh, I don't know what's gotten into him here lately. - Maybe he saw a squirrel. - I don't think so. I don't think a squirrel bothers him. I think it's, uh, he's just getting old and on. Like my wife says about me. - Oh, she'd never say anything like that about you. Hey, I've gotta get these groceries in and start cooking. Are you and your wife coming to the block party? - Oh, wouldn't miss it. It's the best thing that's happened on this block since last year. (suspenseful music) (car door opens) (car door closes) (paper tears) (kitchenware clinks) ♪ I can hear the sound ♪ ♪ Of a barely beating heart ♪ (ominous music) (Julie gasps) - Aren't you the little homemaker. - Who are you? - You're looking good, Linda. Life's been good to you. - What do you want? (intruder breathes deeply) - I'm a little hurt. I thought you'd be happy to see me. It's been a long time. - How did you get in here? - Is that how you're gonna play it, Linda? (Julie chuckles) - I'm not Linda, my... My name is Julie. (gasps) - Your name is Julie? Took a bit to find you. You've done well for yourself. Doctor's wife, huh? Who would've thought? Hm? You know, I didn't recognize you at first. Hair's different. Face has changed. Had some work done, did you? Now, is that a nice way to be, hm? Don't offer me somewhere to sit. Don't offer me something to drink. - Hello, Eddie. - Oh, that's my girl. That's better. So are you gonna offer me that drink now? - You're not gonna be here long enough for a drink. I need you to leave. - Well, that's not gonna happen. At least not right away. You ever think about the good ol' days, Linda, hm? - That was a lifetime ago. - No. No, same life. Although... Looking at you now, it's hard to believe that you're my Linda. - I'm not your anything! - (sighs) No? (chuckles) Well, let me ask you. Does the good doctor know who he married? (giggles) I'm guessing he doesn't. Not the real Linda anyway. (sniffs deeply) If he did, he wouldn't shut his eyes at night. - You need to leave. - Oh. I need a lot of things, Linda, but leaving isn't one of 'em. Things haven't gone real well for me since you split. (Julie chuckles) - I'm sorry to hear that. (chuckles) Maybe counseling might help. - (chuckles) Oh, maybe counseling will help. Funny. No, I was thinking something different. Remember that time we robbed that store? Killed that security guard? - When you killed that security guard. - Tomato. Tomato. I took the fall for it. For you. And you... (chuckles) You just disappeared! Poof. Gone. I guess you only sent me that letter so I wouldn't turn on you, huh? - What do you want me to say, Eddie? "I'm sorry?" - (sighs) That would be a start. I mean, look at you now. I guess marrying a doctor pays better than the street corner. Yeah, my little Linda. The doctor's wife. And two kids, too. - You keep my kids out of this conversation. - You've got the all-American family, Linda. This daughter of yours is kinda cute. I bet she could be real friendly. - I can't go back and change anything. So what do you want me to do? Or do you just wanna ruin things for me? Is that what the plan is? - (sighs) That's not what the plan is. I don't wanna ruin anything for you, Linda. That is, of course, up to you, though. - What do you mean? - Well... Nice house. Nice car. Mm, nice daughter. The way I'm seeing it is, uh, there should be some cash headed my way. Fair is fair, you know. - And how much cash are we talking about? - Let's say we get the ball rollin' with... 20 grand to start? (Julie chuckles) That's right! I won't be greedy. - Uh-huh. - Five a month after that. If you can do that for me, Linda, as far as I'm concerned, I don't have a clue who you are. You can be Julie. You could be the Pope for all I care. I'm thinking that's about the least that you can do for me. After what you put me through! - And how am I supposed to do that without my husband finding out? - Well, I guess that's not my problem, is it? - Even if I could, what makes you think I have access to that kind of money? - (sighs) Again, Linda, that's not my problem. I guess you'll figure it out. - Okay. - I guess it really boils down to how much you like being Julie, the doctor's wife. - Okay. Maybe I can get you the money. But I never wanna see you again. Ever. I so much as smell you and the deal is off, and you can go to hell. I like my life, but I'm not gonna let you destroy me for it. - You'll never see me again. Just keep those deposits coming. (refrigerator door opens) - You know, Eddie... There's just... There's just one little problem with your plan. (suspenseful music) - What's that, Linda? (Linda grunts) (groans) What the fuck? - You! (thud) (grunts) (thuds) (sobs) (knocks) (utensil clangs) (sobs) (Eddie wheezes) (doorbell rings) (pants) - Julie! Julie, it's Susan. (Eddie wheezes) I have the cupcake recipe. Julie? I have the cupcake recipe. Are you here? (footsteps clack) (tense music) (door opens) (door closes) (water splashes) (Julie pants) (Julie pants) (Julie sobs) (ominous swelling strings) (somber music) (Julie grunts and pants) (water splashes) (hairdryer blows) (knocks) (knocks) (suspenseful music) (knocks) - Shit. (breathes deeply) - Hi! Are you okay? - Oh, I'm fine! Just busy, busy, busy. (chuckles) - Well, I'm out of vodka, again. So I thought I'd come over here and help you bake, or whatever you're gonna do for the block party, and catch up, maybe gossip a little bit? - Yeah, okay. You know what? I am so busy and what I'm working on, well, really, it's, it's a one-person job, and I really have to focus, you know, so that I do it right. So, how about we do a rain check on the vodka and I'll see you tomorrow at the block party? - [Susan] Are you sure you're okay? You seem tense. - No, I'm fine. But you know what? This week, vodka, gossip. Promise? - All right. - Looking forward to it. - All right, see ya. - Okay! Bye. - Bye, have a good one. - Yeah, you too. (door closes) (peaceful electronic music) (background chatter) (upbeat guitar music) - Hi, baby. - Hey, Mom. Can I have some chili? - No. Uh, I mean, um, Susan has made burgers for everybody. I think you'd really like the burgers a lot better than the chili. - [Daughter] But why? I wanted to try your chili. - It's way too spicy, and I don't want you eating anything that spicy. Now, go on. Go get a burger. Okay, say hi to Susan for me. - [Brad] Hey, Mom. Hey, can I have some chili? - No. - Why? - No, just go get some lasagna. Mrs. Richie made some lasagna. Go, just- - You know, listen- - Don't, listen to me. - [Brad] I hate lasagna. What's in, what's in- - Just, just, just listen to me. Go, go, go. - [Brad] She's the worst cook I ever known. - Go, go. Lasagna. (background chatter) (upbeat guitar music) - Hi! - Hi! - What do we have here? - I've got some chili. - Oh, that looks delicious. Oh, it smells even better. Can I have some? - Uh, sure. - Well, thank you! - Yeah. (background chatter) (upbeat guitar music) - Mm. You need to be arrested. (Julie chuckles nervously) (ominous music) (grinder whines) (dog barks) (tongue squelches) - [Man] Can we have some of that chili, please? - Absolutely. Here, let me give you a lot. I've got a ton. (chuckles) There you go. - Thank you. I hear it's to die for. - Oh, you have no idea. - You may need my assistance one day. I'm a lawyer. Here you go. Keep that. - Oh. (chuckles) Oh, you're... You're the public defender. - Yes, ma'am, and it sounds like you may need one. Very, very soon. (Julie chuckles) Good luck to you. - Thank you. - Go, sweetie. - Bye. - Bye bye. (Julie chuckles) Hi! - Hi. - Can we please have some of your chili? - No. - [Girl] Why? - Oh, but you're so cute. The hair is beautiful. And I love the dress. No, um... Just no. Go on. - Okay. - Go, go, go. Bye. (background chatter) (upbeat soft rock music) - I think I need to try some of this chili of yours. It's making quite a move around here. - [Julie] Happy to give you some. - Man, you made a lot. - Yeah well it's a new recipe. I've never made it before. Made a lot more than what I expected. You know, I've got more in the house. So, if you like it, I can get you some to take home. - Man, that's delicious. (Julie chuckles nervously) Uh, yes, if you can. - Okay, yeah! - What I don't eat, I can freeze. - Perfect. - I'll tell other folks. - [Julie] That would be just great. That would be just- - I've got the feeling you're gonna get rid of all your extras before you know it. (background chatter) (upbeat soft rock music) - [Julie] Hi! - Hey, everybody keeps telling me about this famous chili. Can I try a little bit? - Oh, absolutely. You can try a lot. You know, I made an awful lot, so if you like it, I've got more in the house, and I can give you some to take home! - Oh, wonderful. - Could I have some chili? - Actually, I'm all out right now. But I've got more in the house. Just give me a second and I'll bring some more out. - Oh, okay. - [Julie] Okay. (eerie music) (pot clangs) (gasps) - Mom! - Oh, my god! Somebody call 911! - Call 911! - Are you okay? Are you okay? (brooding orchestral music) (thunder claps) - Oh, delicious! (chuckles) I was feeling a bit peckish after that one. Oh, let's see what else the cards have in store for us tonight. Perhaps a little dessert? Oh. This will leave you feeling... (thunder claps) Powerless. - [Girl] Is your mom going to be mad at you for not cleaning your room yet? - Don't worry about it. Nicole, I wanna show you something. - What is it, Marco? - Watch. (brooding electronic music) (glass thuds) - Marco! What have I told you about this room? You, young man, get this cleaned up! And you, young lady. You can help him! (sighs) (ominous tones) And... Nicole. Please step outside. Marco. Please don't be afraid. It's not your fault. You have inherited the curse from my grandfather. And I know how much you love magic, but this is not good magic. This is bad magic from the old country. And someday, son, you are going to be the best magician in the world! But please promise me, do you promise me? - Yes, I promise you, Mommy. - (sighs) Thank you, son. (sighs) Now remember, Marco. You promised me. - Yes, Mommy. - You two go play. (door creaks) (somber music) (children laugh) - Look at my brother, Mr. Magic. (children laugh) - Look at that cape of his. - I'm Marco the Great. (children laugh) (dark electronic tones) - [Brother] You're a freak. - Don't worry, Marco. I'll never leave you. - Hey, Vicki. What's up, babe? Yep. Yep, I'm here now. Hey, uh, you take care of that for us? Yeah, yeah. The, uh, the baby thing. Yeah. Look, don't. You know I've got two kids already. I don't need another one. You don't need another one. I'm not, I'm not being a prick. Listen, it's your responsibility not to get pregnant. It's not mine. Everybody knows that. It's the woman, all right? Everyone knows that. All right. Okay, all right. Listen, you get your arse back here, Friday night, front and center with the rest of the girls. That's where I want you to be. That's where you belong. You know that. Otherwise, Vicki... Well, you can fuck off. You got me? - Ron, Marco's on stage. (audience jeers) - [Patron] Get off the stage! (audience jeers) - God, look at him out there. Oh, god. He's dying, right in front of our eyes. Look at him. He must be drinking again, he must be drinking. - Give him a break, Ron. He's had a bad week. He's old. His mom just died. - (chuckles) When? - Oh, like nine months ago. She's like 99. He took care of her his whole life. He's got nothin' left. Just a couple of rabbits and a bottle of Crown Royal. - Yeah, I know. Well, that's his problem, not mine. - [Patron] You're no Houdini, I'll tell you that! - This is terrible! (audience jeers) - I can't watch this. Come on. - [Patron] I want my money back! (footsteps clack) (Marco chuckles) - Mr. Ron. (chuckles) Tough... Tough crowd tonight, huh? (Ron sighs) - Not really, Marco. I mean, they're here to have fun, right? The dancers were appreciated, Jimmy was appreciated. He was telling some good jokes, they were laughing. But that's what he's paid to do. He's paid to do that. - He was great about the rabbi- - I'm not here to talk about how funny Jimmy was! I'm talking about you up there, dying slowly tonight. It was painful. You've been, you've been drinking again before the show. Don't deny it! - I merely had a few. I mean, I... Listen, man, I... I haven't been sleepin'. People have been trying to break into my place. The cops won't do anything, I mean... I'm feeling powerless, man. - You can't feel powerless! You're a magician! I can't have a powerless magician! I've got a lead dancer who's pregnant. I've got a doorman, Ivan, the greeter? He doesn't speak a fucking word of English. I can't have a powerless magician. You understand? (somber orchestral music) - Look, my mom taught me all of this, you know? I mean, she, she taught me all of my tricks. - [Ron] That's great! - It was great. I mean, she said this was the magic for me. And that I should never let it go. - [Ron] What do you mean "this kind of magic?" - I don't, I don't know. I think it was... It was something she saw, maybe. - Listen, Marco. No more drinking before the show, otherwise, you're done. No more. No more, all right? No more drinking. I mean it! (melancholy orchestral music) - I'll never leave you. (Marco gulps) (tense electronic music) (keys clink) (lock clicks) (Marco groans) (thud) (Marco groans) (dark orchestral music) (Marco coughs) (Marco coughs) (Marco coughs) (Marco coughs) (Marco groans) - What, what... What're you doing in my place? Hey, I don't... - Shut up, old man! - Hey, I don't have anything! - Shut up! Better hope we find somethin' or your white ass ain't gonna be pulled outta no black magic hat. Your ass gonna pulled out of a fuckin' river or some shit. Anyways, what's up with all this junk? All this fake-ass magic crap? You know, listen to me, old man. Mr. Marco, Magician Marco. Whatever the hell your name is. I need your drunken ass to focus up and tell us where your money is. - I don't have, I don't have anything. Just, just- - I just told you to focus up, right? I swear I told you, Marco, to focus up, right? Remy, I told his ass to focus up, right? - [Remy] Believe you did, sir. (thugs chuckle) (thud) (Marco groans) (Marco sobs) (thud) (thug grunts) Hey, hey. Hey, let me help. - [Thug] What? - [Remy] Hey, let's just take it easy. Let's get our shit. And let's just get the fuck outta here, man. Forget him. - No. You see that, Marco? "One night. Tonight only. The Great Marco headlines at the Historia Theatre. London, March 13th, 1989." Here's another one, "The Great Marco, wiles his audience with great Houdini spectacular feat, right?" Oh, wow! That's great, man. Look at me. (thud) (Marco groans and sobs) - [Remy] I mean, I don't get it. What makes a man wanna get into all this fake-ass magic crap? Why bother? We all know it's rigged. - Why don't you just ask him, Remy? - [Remy] What? - He's probably just some fake old preacher, skimming off the fortunes of the fucking poor. Now, tell me how some old white dude pull this shit off, huh? Aw, shit. You know what? - Hey! Hey, hey, hey. - Marco. What, man? - [Remy] Hey, just take it easy, all right? He's beat. - We have the fuckin' power, Marco. We have questions and we want some fuckin' answers, right? - I don't, I don't... I won't tell. - Okay, Marco. We got some stuff. We got your watch. We got the cash you left in your big black hat. We're about ready to get outta here, but not yet. It's all good. But first... Got a few questions to ask you. Do you like tricking people? - (sobs) Leave me alone! Just leave me alone. I won't tell the police. I, I won't... (thug laughs) I promise! - Really? You promise? That's nice, he promises that he ain't gonna call the fuckin' police on us. Man, fuck you! (thud) (Marco groans) - Hey, man. Hey, man, hey. Hey, we already got our shit. You wanna stay here all night and keep fuckin' with this dude? We already got our shit, now let's just get the fuck outta here! - No, man. Marco. - You're on your own. (thug chuckles) - You hear that, Marco? We're alone now. So tell me, how you start this shit up, huh? I'm curious. (chuckles) - [Marco] My, my mom taught me. It, it made her happy. - Oh. (chuckles) That's nice, Marco. (thud) (Marco groans) (chuckles) Look at this shit. The Eagles has finally fuckin' landed. (chuckles) This is one ugly motherfuckin' suit. You a pimp, Marco? (claps) You a pimp, Marco? (chuckles) - [Mother] Please promise me. - Yes. I promise you, Mommy. I promise. (thug chuckles) - You promise? That's nice. That's nice that you promise, Marco. (chuckles) - I remember now, where I got my magic. My power. It's all getting quite clear. And pretty exciting. B? I think you should've left with Remy. - Should've left with Remy? What the fuck are you talkin' about, old man? Leavin' with Remy. I know this magic shit ain't true. (chuckles) - B? That's a funny name. B. (chuckles) - You better shut up, old man. You're really starting to get on my nerves. - How do you go from Claude Phillip Knowles, to B? Wow. Now, that's magic. (Claude chuckles) - Oh, right. You're just pullin' some magic shit on me. Okay. (chuckles) Let me ask you this. How'd you know my name? (Marco chuckles) Really? You know, I'm really gonna have to mess you up for real now, right? (Marco chuckles) - You wanna kill me, B? Yes, I believe that is what you wanna do. Tell me. Does Remy know how much you like him? (chuckles) - What? What the fuck are you talkin' about, old man? Remy's my boy. - [Marco] Do you feel me, B? - Shut up. Shut up. I swear I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. (sighs) - Life is a... Unique journey of self-discovery, B. An adventure, where you get to find out who you are, and what you can be become. (chuckles) I know who you are. You're a little gangster, who likes other little gangsters. - Shut the fuck up, old man! (intense music) I'm done with your freaky black-ass magic shit! You know what? It's showtime, motherfucker! - Yes! It is. (sinister carnival music) (chuckles) Look at you. All dressed up for your stage debut. This is very exciting. (chuckles) You must be feeling very, very strange right now. Am I right? (chuckles) You had the power, but not anymore. You're a bully, Claude. And now I have the power to stop you. Now... What do I wanna be? Tell me, Claude. What were you gonna do with the knife? I really wanna know. - I... I don't know, man. I don't know. - [Marco] Claude. The truth. What were you gonna do with your knife? I need to know, Claude. - I guess I was gonna hurt you, man. I don't know. I guess I was gonna hurt you, okay? - [Marco] I want you- - What? - To show me. - Show you? I can't even fuckin' move, man! Whatever the fuck you did to me, the voices that I hear. I swear, if I could show you, I'd cut the hell out of you right now! - Oh, how rude of me. (chuckles) You can't move. I forgot that you can't move. (ethereal tones) Now, show me. - No. Stop. (breathes heavily) Stop, stop. Stop. No, no. Please. Please. - Show me! (flesh squelches) (Claude groans) (flesh squelches) It's quite violent. Don't worry, Claude. (Claude pants) It's nearly over. But before we go our separate ways, I'd really like to thank you for coming tonight. I'd like to thank you for coming. Thanks to you, I'm a changed man. Are you ready for your finale? - Fuck you. - [Marco] Take a bow, Claude. - Stop. Please, stop. Stop. Stop, please! (sobs) (dark music) Stop! Please. Please don't do this. Don't do this, please. Please, please. Stop! Stop, stop! (flesh squelches) (Marco chuckles) (Marco sighs) - Now, that's magic. (sinister carnival music) (chuckles) (audience applauds and cheers) That's a wrap! Goodbye, everybody! (audience applauds and cheers) - That was a fantastic show tonight. You did amazing. (Marco chuckles) - It's great. It's great to be back. (knocks) (Nicole sighs) - Mr. Marco, (chuckles) wonderful show tonight. (chuckles) Really, I mean... Excellent, if you don't mind me saying. - (chuckles) Are you okay, Ron? You look a little sweaty, man. - No, no, I'm fine. I'll just, uh... The lion, Mr. Marco? Where's the lion? (chuckles nervously) - Is that all you liked about the show tonight was the lion? - No, no, no, no, no. No, I, uh... Elvis, when you... Elvis walked on the stage. I mean, that was really... (chuckles nervously) Bravo, I mean, really, how did you do that? I mean, really, it was a hologram or something? - Ron, you know you're not allowed to ask. - Sorry. Sorry about that. Got it. Thank you so much. Enjoy. (giggles) (Marco laughs) (sighs) Jeez. (lion growls) (chuckles) (cat meows) Here, kitty, kitty. Come on. Come on. (chuckles) (ethereal tones) (lion roars) (gasps) (screams) - Let that be a lesson to you! (thunder claps) Never play with magic. And now, for our last foray into the unknown... Ah, perfect. The correctors. (thunder claps) (laughs ominously) (train bell rings) - Do you mind if I sit here? - Oh, good morning, Dean. Yes, this is Connie Schmidt. I'm not feeling well today and I think I'm going to have to call in sick. I have a really good friend, Carol, who is a good substitute teacher. I'll give her a call. Okay, great, great. Thank you, 'cause I really don't feel well. All right. Bye bye. - So you're a school teacher? - I am. I teach at Justice Middle School. - That sounds fascinating. - Oh, yeah. If I can just make it 12 more months, and I retire and off to Europe. - Good for you. - Oh, my gosh. This is my stop. - Have a good day. - Okay. You have a great day. - I'm sure I will. (train horn blares) - Are you playing football tonight? - Probably. (door creaks) (knocks) - Good morning, Mr. Pineat. - Yes, good morning. - I'm Miss Nickols, the substitute teacher. The agency sent me? - Wow, that was fast. - Mm-hm. - Please, take a seat. Give me a minute here. - Sure. - You know what? You room, it's gonna be room 209. - Okay. - Can you go there? And I'll be there in a minute? - Okay! I will. - Please, thank you. - Good morning, class. I'm Miss Nickols, your substitute for today. - [Students] Good morning, Miss Nickols. - Today, we will be having a lesson on actions and their consequences. I see you have packets on your desk, and we're gonna be jotting down some ideas. I'm just gonna come check your work. - [Female Student] I'd rather be a mermaid than sit in here. - [Male Student] I wish we didn't have science today. - [Male Student] I hope Jordan can make football tonight. - Hey, sorry I'm late, Miss. - Have a seat. - [Female Student] I don't wanna go to Aunt Sally's tonight. She drives me crazy. - I hope that ho turns up tonight. What the hell was that for? - You know what it was for. - [Jordan] I just wanna kill myself. Nobody understands me. (bell rings) - Jordan. May I have a moment? (suspenseful music) Jordan, if you do exactly what I say, the abuse will stop. - How did you know? - It's hard to explain, but I know. If you trust me, I can make it stop. When you go home tonight and your dad starts in, I want you to loudly tell him "stop! My teacher said that it's wrong for you to treat me this way and if you keep doing it, she will send you a visitor." - Will it work? - Yes. Trust me. (suspenseful music) - What have I told you, boy, about doing your homework at the kitchen table? Did you pray for forgiveness? Did you beg? - Well, you can't hurt me anymore! My teacher told me so! - Well, I'm telling you this! Tell your teacher this is what I think of her! Now get to bed, boy! No supper for you! - I'm sorry! - Get to bed, boy! No supper for you till you learn! No wonder your mother left you. (door slams) Hey, boy. - Yes, Papa? - God has given you everything you need, and what've you given in return? Nothing but "I want this, I want that." You are shameful in the teachings of the Lord. - I know Jesus loves me, but- - Shut your blasphemous mouth, boy, and get to bed. - [Jordan] No, Daddy! (heartbeat thuds) (suspenseful music) (dark ethereal tones) (ominous tones) (father chokes) (siren wails) - Morning, Mike. - Hey, good morning, Doc. - How's the patient this morning? - Really? - How are we today, Heinz? - Oh, pretty well. - Good, good. Did you sleep well? - Well, reasonably well, but I hope we can squeeze in a sponge bath, because I am getting a little itchy here. - Maybe tomorrow. - Uh-huh. - I'll take a little listen here. (Heinz breathes deeply) That all sounds good. Just take this. Oh! What's that? - Those are my rosary beads. - I'm sorry. Didn't mean to offend. You have a wonderful day. (suspenseful music) (door squeaks) - Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry. - No, no, it's fine. - Oh, my. Okay, well, you have a good day. - Yes, you too. Thank you. (rumbling) - Hey, Doc. You forget somethin'? Doctors. (door closes) - Change your mind about the sponge bath, Doctor? - Where you're going, there's no need for a sponge bath. (whooshing) (yelling in German) (whooshing) (door creaks) (door closes) (officer sighs) - [PA System] Code blue. Code blue. Code blue. Code blue. Code blue. Code blue. Code blue. (rumbling) (whooshing) Code blue. Code blue. Code blue. (bell dings) (bell dings) - Can I help you, sir? - I have information about the missing mayor. - Excuse me? The mayor? - The missing mayor. I have information. - Oh, I see. Have a seat, sir. Detective will be at you soon. - I'm Detective Alders. Can I help you with something, sir? - I have information regarding the missing mayor. - Would you like to come back to an interview room with me so we can speak privately? Right this way. We're gonna go in here and first room to your left. (door slams) So what kind of information do you have? - Well... Where do I start? - Well, why don't we begin with why you came here? You said you have some information on the disappearance of the mayor. - You tell me, Detective. Have you found his body yet? - Body? Why would you think we were looking for a body? He's only been missing 24 hours. - Yes, body. You'll find him, face-down and rotting in Detective Summers' swimming pool with a missing tongue. - (chuckles) And how do you know this? - Call him, Detective. Check it out. - I'll be right back. (informant chuckles) Okay, I've sent patrol units to, uh, check out your story. I appreciate he information and I'll take it from here. If you would just make sure to give the desk sergeant your contact information, I'll be in touch. - "Be in touch." The information about the mayor, that's just a tease. I have much more information about your other missing persons, or should I say your "cold cases." - Like I said, if you would just leave your information with the desk sergeant, I would be happy to get back... (phone rings) Alders. - [Officer] Found the mayor in the pool, and guess what? His, uh, tongue is completely ripped out. - Okay. Thank you very much, I'll get back to you. I'm all ears. - Not that easy. I'll wait for Detective Summers to arrive. - Do you know Detective Summers? - Mm. I know everyone and everything. - Well, he's not home right now, so... (phone chimes) Would you like some coffee? - No, coffee just gives me the jitters. If you know what I mean. - Do you mind if I go get a cup? - [Informant] Knock yourself out. - I'll be right back. (door closes) - All right, so what've we got? - Oh, man, this dude knows that the mayor was in your pool. He knows that his tongue's missin'. He's got all this information. - Ah, Jesus. The press are gonna have a field day with this one. - Have a seat, Detective. It's gonna be a long night. - Okay. So to start with, how'd you know the mayor drowned? - Why does a man drown with a missing tongue? - How did you know the mayor's tongue was missing? - Let me educate you, Detective. The human condition is not easily defined, nor is it easily managed. - Let's be straight with each other. We're here, right now, because you walked in here with information the press doesn't even have. You mentioned others. Enlighten me. - You know, anyone can see that the pair of you are fools. - (chuckles) Wow. You sit here like this is a joke. Like I don't have you every which way but loose. - You, Mr. Detective, have been watching too many Clint Eastwood movies. This quaint little town of Justice is a joke. You see, and you are its main attraction. Over the past two years, how many cold cases have you had? Well, let me tell you. Four. No, sorry, I already gave you one now, so it's three. - Okay. You've got my attention. - [Informant] Grandma Elly, remember her? Her grandchild and the parents died in a very mysterious way. See, Noble, he got so close, that I had to allow him to leave this world. - (chuckles) Wow. We missed so much. Yeah. Yeah, this is getting weird. (informant laughs) - Gettin' weird, huh! (chuckles) Wait till you hear the next fuck-up you made. You're gonna love it. You remember getting a call from Justice Middle School, about someone impersonating a teacher? - [Summers] No. (informant chuckles) - It was the same day that Anton Bromvenski choked to death. They found mysterious marks on his neck. Child-like hand marks, and guess what, Detective? - Oh, no. No, let me guess. You were there. - [Alders] Yes, a report was filed, but no arrests were made. - Alders, pass me the cold case files. Please, continue. - November 11, 2016. You received a call from Eddie Carr's mother. Now, she was very upset, because her son hadn't come home for weeks. So you ran a search for just two days. Is that because Eddie Carr was a known felon? But either way, you failed. You just didn't look. - You killed Eddie? - (chuckles) You're gonna have to do better than that, Detective. I told you, I want to negotiate. - So far, all you've done is dig yourself into a deep hole, and dive headfirst. All you've given me is a public date. - Also, there was Julie, lying lifeless in her driveway. - And how do you know that? - Because I was there. - You have not given me anything that the press didn't release to the public. - I think I was the only person who saw Eddie Carr in some form at that party that day, and by the way, Julie made a hell of a chili. But all that will come to pass. Do you remember Remy Jackson, and Claude Phillip Knowles? Also known as B. B's body was found with his throat cut out. Poor Remy, he's doing life now for a murder that he did not commit. - Again, public knowledge. - Can I help you? - I'm here to see my client. They're expecting me. - Please have a seat. (knocks) Excuse me, his attorney's here. - Thank you. - Alders, charge this nut with wasting police time. - Did you find the knife, Detective? - Well, as a matter of fact, we did. - Oh, well, then you don't need to know that it was a small blade, a pocket knife. Did the press ever release pictures of those three puncture wounds on the upper-right side? (chuckles) (door closes) (eerie tones) (door closes) You know I'm innocent. - If you are innocent, I wouldn't be here. - I've waited so long to meet you. - And I, you. (thud) (groans) (rumbling) (whooshing) Give my client a few minutes. He will give you more information about the Nazi war criminal. - Ah. We get to be heroes. (chuckles) - Just for one day.
