Next item of the programme, combatant chastushkas sung by the wives of Red Army soldiers. There're eight pines in our forest And the ninth one is a spruce. There is a funny story Which to you we'll introduce. Let's stop sitting in the yard, When the folks are working hard. Tell ?em how it happened, really. Start your chattering then, will you? We were going down the road Suddenly, alarm goes off! Lights go out, sirens wailing, We look for a place to stay in. Into the warehouse we went, Smelled a stinking and foul scent, It was an attack, we thought, But it was vegetables rot! - No way, Vera! - Katya, really! Keep on chattering then, will you? Didn't run off very far, When before us came a car. Tires screeched, the doors opened, We were real scared that moment! Doctor's looking very mad Saying that we should be dead. On and on the story strides, To the hospital we drive. - No way, Vera!- Katya, really! Keep on chattering then, will you? Then in bandages they wrapped us, Gave us pills and drops and tablets, Then they thought we're good to go, Let us out and sent us home. We returned and looked around, Saw our granny crying loud, Shivering and shaking head She was really really scared. - No way, Vera! - Katya, really! Keep on chattering then, will you? Groaning, moaning, spitting spit, She said, stammering a bit: "When the sirens' signal started, Lights went out, the flat have darkened, Suddenly, without a cause, A man bursts in, without a pause And cries to me right from the enter: ?Gas attack! please, give me shelter!? - No way, Vera! - Katya, really! Keep on chattering then, will you? Listening to the silly gran, To the dining-room we ran. And we saw the man as such, In his shoes and on the couch! Lying there on the bed, The man told us he was dead. And after taking a deep breath, He called it a suspended death! - No way, Vera! - Katya, really! Keep on chattering then, will you? Night has passed and day has come, The dead man is still around. Drinking tea with sugar spoons, Eating bread with butter too! ?How about you go away?? - The dead man sits down to shave. ?How about some good manners?? - He sits down to play the piano! - No way, Vera! - Katya, really! Keep on chattering then, will you? No more time for jokes or tricks, There goes another week. The dead man sits in our flat, Getting comfy, getting fat. What a nuisance, this event And this annoying lively man! When he?s technically dead, He can?t be a tenant of the flat! - Enough, Vera! - Katya, stop! Let?s go dancing to the song! Getting warmer, getting warmer, The banya in the backyard. Getting married, getting married, Vanya, my sweetheart. Don't get warmer, don't get warmer, Banya in the backyard. Don't get married, don't get married, Vanya, my sweetheart. Third item! "Tango"! A mock dance of the silhouettes! Performed by Charlie Chaplin, Miss Lucy, Pat and Patachon! Experiment four. An autumn in the South Georgia In 1933 the amount of tangerines harvested in Georgia reached a record number of 100 millions. Comrade Stalin has assigned a task for the bolsheviks of Georgia: to harvest 500 millions of lemons, oranges and tangerines in 1937. To do this, 250,000 ha of fruitful soil, now covered with malarial swamps, will be DRAINED and turned into a blooming garden... And soviet Georgia will turn into soviet Florida... And tangerines, oranges, lemons, which used to be a luxury... will become consumed widely by the workers of the Soviet Union! (comrade Beria's speech at the 17th Congress) With that, we've completed our experimental work, and started the production of the first fiction film with sound and color - "Little Nightingale". We will show this film on the soviet screens in the nearest future! The end. The First Soviet Experimental Cine-Revue with Color and Sound "A Carnival of Colors" has been restored digitally in 2012 from the original color-separated negatives in Gosfilmofond collection.
