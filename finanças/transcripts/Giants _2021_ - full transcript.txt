There are people who say they'll do one thing and then do another. They talk for years, they're all like that. A friend of mine once climbed a three-story building. "I'm going up to the roof", he said. Then he slipped. He was sixteen years old. He said one thing and then did another. You said you would stay forever. You said it. But you didn't stay. You did like everyone else. Also I used to say a lot of things as a child. But then I realised I wouldn't do them. So I didn't talk anymore. How are you? The bus passed by each small town. It didn't miss a single one. It took me two and a half hours. Shit. Well, at least I didn't pay for the ticket. - And how did you manage that? - What? Not pay. I didn't have any money, I didn't pay. - Do you know that I graduated? - Yes? - In what? - A bit of everything, online. - Online? - Yes, online. I met quite a few people, too. Who? Quite a few people, smart people, who know a lot of things. And where did you meet them? Online... And Lucia? What about her? How is she? Lucia's gone. Where did she go? Eh, she's gone. And the baby? The baby is gone too. And you? Still an asshole? Me? An asshole? You look like an asshole... Fuck... you're ugly... Well, no, alright, I'm sorry. - Hi Stefanì. - Why did you come from this side? As you know... You never know. Beautiful this house, Stefanì... Really twentieth century style... My aunt's style. Hi, Massimè. Tonight I'll blow you away, Escobar. Here's everything you want, Escobar. I really want to Escobar. What a desire to fuck... Because I fuck, and when I fuck, I fuck hard. If we clean this well, it'll last three days, maybe two. This one's professional. Do we have the bottle? Stefanì, I brought you this, but I'll give it to you later. - Why later? - Shit, you're always quiet. If I give you this you'll zone out the whole night. I've got some speed... - Shall we have a shot? - Come on. What have you been doing all these months? Stuff... I've been watching television... Walker, Texas Ranger all the time. I've been helping my uncle on the land... Gardening... chopping wood. And you, Stefanì? - Dunno. - What do you mean? Dunno... Look who's here... So, Piero, did you go to the ATM? Yes, I did... But curves, curves, curves... I almost threw up... And you didn't throw up? - Hi. - Hi. And who is he? He's my brother. Your brother? Really? Yes. He grew up... He became a pretty guy. - You doing drugs too? - No. He doesn't touch shit. So you just masturbate? And if not, what the fuck does he do? I only use baking soda. Ammonia doesn't fit in my house. Because if not, if you use ammonia, you'll smoke ammonia and it'll suck. Whereas if you use baking soda, you get all the right flavor. It's good here, it's good here. You are both comical and tragic. - Because you're a liar. - I care about you, Massimè. Me too. Let's love each other as long as you do what you have to do. There's one little thing, though... These things are just for fun, just for fun... Why didn't you help Brunetto? There you go again. Brunetto is gone. He even got himself into trouble. Stealing is not easy. - Brunetto is dead. - What could I have done about it? - You had nothing to do with it? - No. That's how party funding has worked for years. - It's easy, isn't it? - Why, what did Brunetto do? When it's no longer a game and it becomes a sport, the party is over. With funding. What about the money you owe me? What are you getting at, my friend? Where do I want to get to? Let's talk about Brunetto... You already know what he did. - So who's your cop friend? - What cop, what friend? This is a story built of lies, like Putin's friend, the one who died badly... What the fuck does Putin have to do with it? The doctors, the university professors, the nurses, the hall leaders... Well, Schopenhauer... shall you pop the cherry? Find out who's on it. It was illicit funding, I'm sorry, but poor Brunetto. And meanwhile Brunetto voted for you... You all voted for him, too... to this asshole... - I didn't vote for you. - Little foreskin... You've been running scams together... you're still here, he's somewhere else. Huh? You like that? I'm a disciplined man, and I care about you... And you invited me here... but it's not like I can be a devoted listener and hear all your non-ideas. Because you don't have ideas. You have no idea. What fucking idea do you have? In fact, now we're going to warm another plate, we'll make an occasion of it, we're going to open a bottle from the Stefanian caste... or not, Stefanì? - Dunno. - What don't you know? - Let's pop the champagne, damn it. - Dad doesn't want to. And Mom, what does she want? Let's open the champagne, damn it, I've brought you Colombia here. In the meantime you like getting high with silly games, playing the asshole. Huh? This champagne is plonk. Let's hope that at least Clemente Mastello's contacts here are a little more quality. Or not, Clementino? When will those chicks arrive? Your Moulin Rouge friends... Why, who should come? - Some chicks. - And why? - What you mean, "why"? - Because I don't want any women. Seriously? You've gone fag? I told you Stè, if there are women I won't come. And what have you got against women? Do you want me as much as I want you? One for Daddy... One for Grandpa... I love you. - Your friends are nice. - Aren't they? Yes. Do you know who he looks like? - No. - He looks like Pierino. - Yes? - Yes. - To Pierino high on drugs. - No, he doesn't look stoned. He seems... I don't know... funny. Yes. Very funny and freaky. Are you retarded? Yes. Are you a friend of Piero's? Yes, when it suits him. - And where are you from? - I'm from my parent's house. - Yes, but where do you live? - A hundred kilometers from here. And you've come a hundred kilometers to get here? A nice little trip. Why are you sad? You look sad. - Do I look sad? - A bit. You're awesome. Shit, you're really... dunno... awesome. Then they cut a hole in the watermelon and put all the wine inside it. Seriously, a whole bottle inside the watermelon. And we drank it all. - Really? All of it? - All of it! - And how was it? - I don't know... I don't really like wine, but inside the watermelon was delicious. - How nice... - Yes. - Excuse me, Jennifer... - My name is not Jennifer. Yeah, whatever... Come with me for a moment, come on... Wait, I'm wearing heels. Actually, I feel in shape. I feel pretty good. I don't know, maybe the moustache. They're a bit old, a bit sad. - How are you feeling? - I'm fine. I'm glad. Shall we have a bath? Come on, we'll have a nice warm bath. I prepared it just for you. Isn't Piero paying for it? Come on, take your clothes off. It smells beautiful... You're my dream, my dream as a child. - Your friend is crazy! - Why? What do I know? He's completely crazy. - What did he do? - He was naked! - But... completely? - All naked! Who the fuck do you think you are? You didn't come to my house to play princess, did you? You dirty fucking bitch! If I could fly I'd glide right into your ass. - Is he crazy? - Can't you see he's sick? Don't you have any feelings? Nothing? Fuck, you ruined my life. Still here? I'll break your face! You came here to take money and cock, cock and money. Fuck. Get out of here now or I'll shoot your fucking faces. Girls, girls... sorry... Fuck you! I got a little nervous... How old are you? How old do you think I am? I think you're 12-13 years old in the body of a walking corpse. And everyone here understands... you're sad, you're a loser. You're desperate. You can't even look me in the eye. That gun behind your ass is a kid's toy. Are you a baby? You're wearing a nappy? Yes... Every morning you wake up, look at the sun and poop your pants. - Why? - Do you understand? Loaded gun, unloaded gun, I'll break you. - You'll break me? - Yes, I'll break you! And why will you break me? I'll explain it to you another day. - What day? - The day you learn to listen. - But I am listening. - No, you're not listening. Yes, I am listening to you. Look me in the eye! Take the fucking gun! So we can see who you are, a dumb kid or a dumb adult. Were you going to shoot those girls? Shoot me now! Or can't you? Shoot the picture then, that's easier. Asshole, can you hear me? Shoot the picture! Don't you want to shoot the picture? Shoot me! Do something, asshole! Shoot the picture! Are you happy now? Not really, you shot a picture four times. You're literally the biggest asshole in the world. Of the two shots you have left, one is for you. Are you happy? Any of you guys want to smoke? Because I want to smoke, I'm already getting nervous. Something unrepeatable is happening today. And what is it that's unrepeatable? Today the Swan comet passes by, ending its race in the sun. Ending its race in the sun? Yes. It crashes into the sun and dies there. Into the sun? But it's night. Yes, but the sun is behind it. You see it as it passes by. You see the tail of the comet. The tail. Yes, as it passes by. It's a one-time event. It will never happen again, because it flies into the sun and dies. So? When does it pass? It's already passed. What do you mean it's already passed? I didn't see shit. Neither have I. Why didn't you say anything? I didn't have time, it passed. Fine, but you could have warned us. I thought you were all in silence admiring it. What are you saying? Things pass. The problem is being able to see them. I've seen it, it passed by earlier... Stefano has seen it... You didn't see shit. I've been thinking about what to do. - What? - Basically you must go to Livorno. To Livorno? To do what? Nothing, but merchant ships sail from Livorno. Merchant ships? Yes, merchant ships going straight to Cambodia. - To Cambodia? - Yeah, Cambodia. What would you do in Cambodia? You know what's great about Cambodia? No. What is it? - There's nothing in Cambodia. - There's nothing? - Nothing. - And how are you going to Cambodia? I've told you. By merchant ship. You sneak into the hold, curl up beside the corn, and then you get to Cambodia. - You curl up? - Yes, you curl up. You curl up and stay huddled two months next to the corn, in a merchant ship. Yes, but then you get to Cambodia. - And what do you do in Cambodia? - Nothing. Nothing? Yeah, there's shit to do in Cambodia. You're right. I'm the biggest asshole in the world. You've got it right. I'm really useless. A fool. Could you do me a favor? This light is hurting my eyes. Could you turn it off? If you want, I'll also disconnect the meter, bro. Bro. Yes, unplug everything. Then turn it on again. But unplug it five minutes, please. It's bothering me. Thank you. Do you want to know what I'm thinking about? What are you thinking about? About the fact that whether you're here or not, it doesn't change anything. And what do you want to do? You can't do anything. Then you think about old things... which aren't that old... And you realize you're useless. Even if you disappear, nothing would change. This is my world. It's like that for everyone, bro. Same world for everyone. Bro, bro... What the fuck? Why do you call me bro? Don't fucking call me bro. It bothers me. Sorry, call me whatever the fuck you want. You know I'm an actor? Your thoughts, dreaming on a softened brain, like an over-fed lackey... Well, who can remember... How disgusting. Majakovskij. Are you staring at me? Stop... You know the people who can't take it anymore, who kill their wives and children and then shoot themselves in the head? I've come this close. This close. Then I didn't do it. But inside me it's the same. I'm a murderer. I'm worse than a murderer. But now I've figured out what I have to do. What is it? I can't tell you. Because you'd laugh, it sounds like a joke. But it's not a joke. It's the shittiest thing I've ever thought in my entire life. It's the shittiest thing of all. But it's right. It's the shittiest fucking thing I've ever thought. But it's right. A big bang. Under the train. The train that passes by and doesn't stop. Lucia lives right next to the railway. Well, one of these days I'm going to visit Lucia. Her and the baby. She won't even let me in the house. Like always. "No, you better wait outside, I'll let the baby out, so you can say hello to her." And then I'll wait outside... at the right time. Then the baby will come out... "Hi sweety, Daddy brought you a beautiful flower." Meanwhile, I'll hear the train coming. And as soon as I hear it coming, I run and throw myself under it. Under the train. So then my daughter will see me smashed, like a dog. Then she will hate her mother forever. Because she'll think her father died because her mother didn't let him in for a coffee. And she'll hate her forever... but she'll never forget me. There are people who say they'll do one thing and then do another. I've always known that. You say everything has changed. But nothing has changed. Now you can't get close to people. And who has ever? I'm not what I say. Nor am I what I do. What do I feel? What do I see? I don't know. I have never known. You all struggle every day. You all strive to see things that aren't there. Are you afraid of me? I've always been afraid of you. You say one thing but do another. You are made of clay. So distant. And if I don't exist, neither you do. I've talked too much. Nobody would have listened to me anyway. - Everything all right? - Yes, why? Don't you think you're exaggerating? No, I'm perfectly fine. Whatever. Wakey wakey. Would the gentleman like some cocaine, heroin, some Renazena nasal spray? Massimè... Massimè... What was the name of that girl who studied acting with you? - Who? - That gorgeous blonde. Who? I need a pocket book of the penal code when I look at her ass. The scandalous blondie. Do you remember her? - Who? - The one you went to school with. No, I don't remember her. Piè, why don't you make me chief of staff? It's always been my dream to be chief of staff. I'll nominate you for head of the Culture Committee. I see your brother as head of the Culture Committee. Because to me it seems he has the right characteristics to take on institutional roles, important roles, high offices of the state... He's good, he's improved... This meeting, this evening, has done him good... What happened to her? - Come on, you remember her... - Who? Blondie, the scandalous one. The beautiful one, she was tiny. - Do you remember her? - No. - A Vespa scooter... - A white dress? - A Vespa scooter. - A white dress? A Vespa scooter. Fuck, you're a nag. I mean, I love you, but you're a nag. - Can't you see I'm dancing? - How hot she was... Can't you see? Can't you see I'm dancing? - A Vespa scooter. - Leave me alone. Let me go for a moment. Can't you see I'm dancing? Can't you see I'm having fun for once? For once that I'm enjoying myself, you're nagging me. Leave me alone. Piè, tell him something. Don't nag him, come on... - What about her sister? - Who? You'll remember her sister more, who was much more flashy. Instead, she was natural, the girl-next-door. She's dead. Did she? How? She fell down and died. She was so pretty... I think I'd do her today, too. Franco! Bring me a Carintia, here at the table. What a good boy. - What an extraordinary man. - My pride. Bobbed hair. Did she have bobbed hair? She had a mole. A mole on her forehead. - Do you remember it? - A mole on her forehead? Just search in the diary... Look for "F" for forehead and you've found her. They used to call her "Beer can". Because once at a party she filled up a beer can. Giving blowjobs. Fuck, I don't remember. Such beautiful parties... That kind of grossed me out. It really did. Want a smoke? Assholes! Assholes! Assholes! Assholes! Assholes! Assholes! Fucking asshole! Assholes! Assholes! Assholes! Ass... Good morning Stefanì, did you put all the stuff in the safe? Stefanì... Stefanì... Stè... Fuck, Stè... Oh, Stè! Stefanì! Oh fuck! Stè! Help! Stè! Fucking hell! Stefanì, fuck! Stè! Help! Fuck, Stè! Help! Stè... Stefanì! Fuck! Stè... Stefanì! Stefanì... Stefanì... Help! Help... Stefanì! Stefanì, come on... Stefanì, help! Call a doctor... Help! Call an ambulance. Help... Get an ambulance. Shit, he's dead. Riccà, call an ambulance. If he's already dead, why should I call an ambulance? Should I call an ambulance? Call an ambulance. Maybe it's better if you call it. - Call an ambulance. - Why do I have to call it? Call an ambulance... Call an ambulance! I can't call an ambulance. Why not? Because I'm afraid. If I call it then it happens... then, at the end... understand? Then, at the end, it happens... What the fuck is going to happen at the end? I was the one who called it. In my opinion there is only one thing to do. There is only one right thing to do. Give him a proper burial, here, in his backyard. We dig a pit and cover him with soil... With the soil from his motherland. And then maybe later we put something on it... A few flowers... some seeds... peppers, courgettes, cucumbers, ravioli. And he will live here forever. Along the sap of those plants. Imagine bro, a hearse arriving instead. A hearse with three guys that none of us have ever seen... a wooden coffin... and they lock him inside. It's bad. Bro. Isn't it? Instead if we bury him here, he breathes. And to breathe... you try it too... breathing is very important... breathe into your roots... in your land... which only in that moment becomes yours. And if he could talk, bro, do you know what he would say? He would tell you the story of your grandparents, the adventures of your great-uncles, of the Shardana warriors... of the giants of Mont'e Prama, who made their way with their saber and pierced anyone who stood in front of them. I didn't know Stefano... Not as much as you... But I'm sure of one thing... He would have killed people with his sword... it was clear from his eyes... Fierce, evil... Just like a giant. Riccà, you're not OK, get dressed. Get dressed and we're leaving. I'm dressed already. Riccardo, move your ass! You've got to move! No, I'm staying here. - What are you doing? - Staying here. What are you doing? I'm telling you, if you don't come with me, I'll kick your ass. I'm fine here, I feel reborn. - You're not coming? - No. All right, go fuck yourself. Where the fuck are you going? Good boy, shoot another frame now. Or the chandelier... You're good at running away when others need you. Now he needs you and you want to go. Why? Why are you leaving? Why are you leaving? Why? Why do you leave when others need you? Why? Get out! Go away. Go away. Listen to me, asshole, if you're a loser, it's not my fault. If you have nothing to hold on to, I have nothing to do with it. Do you understand? You're fucking inept! A parasite... I got you good. Bro, I don't understand why you're behaving this way... Didn't you get it? You still haven't figured out where this story was supposed to go. It's not even a story... it's more a fable, a little poem. All of this. Bro, all of this does not exist. It's all in your head. We are not here. It's what tricks you. Bro, you believe it. It's not possible. If you believe it, you're done. You're finished if you believe it. Do you understand? None of this exists. Do you know what happened once, on a school trip? I found a man's skull buried in the ground. And do you know whose skull it was? You will never believe it. It was mine. According to them, it was me, dead. Do you think I believed it? No. Do you know what I told them? You are crazy. You are completely crazy. I'm not that skull, do you understand? I said so! I'm not that chicken. I'm not the one you're looking for. I'm not what you are looking for. Go and look for it among the domesticated animals that you like so much. Do you know what am I? I'm a beautiful royal pelican. A beautiful royal pelican. I fly high in the sky. Where no one can stop me. And no one can hurt me or touch me. I fly above the water and zac, I grab the fish. To feed me, one more day. Not for fun... just to survive. A beautiful royal pelican, fisherman. Nothing can hurt me. Because I know how to fish. What the fuck are you saying! Asshole! What the fuck are you saying? Don't treat me badly. Why do you treat me badly? You don't have to treat me so badly... You're good at picking on helpless people. They're not here. They're not here... they don't exist! It's all in your head. Do you understand? It's all here. You don't have to believe it. If you believe it, you are dead too. Stop. Don't go there. Don't go there. You're dead too. They came to get us, do you get it? They came to get us. To make us do what they want. If you go there, you're dead. You're dead too. Do you understand? Don't go there. Because if you go, we're dead. Shut up, you must shut up... The Demons have come to take us, to make us do what they want... We entered through the main gate of heaven and then they chased us away. Like thieves! Thieves! As if we were thieves! Shut up. You have to shut up! Die in silence. There are people who say they'll do one thing and then do another. I've always known that. You say everything has changed. But nothing has changed. Now you can't get close to people. And who has ever? I'm not what I say. Nor am I what I do. What do I feel? What do I see? I don't know. I have never known. You all struggle every day. You all strive to see things that aren't there. I saw what I wanted to see, many years ago. It was beautiful. It was your baby eyes. And as I thought I was flying higher and higher, I was really sinking lower and lower. Are you afraid of me? I've always been afraid of you. You say one thing but do another. I know what you told me. You said it from your heart. And so I believed it... But then the words disappear... And they have never been worth anything. I've figured this out. There is no love in you. There is no joy, nor adventure. And as I speak I hear your voice. It still speaks to me from times past. Still inside me. Stupid, useless... Sweet.
