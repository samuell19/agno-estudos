[inspirational music] [soft rattling] [birds chirping] [wind blowing] [gentle music] [Andrea] When I was a child, my grandfather wanted to buy me a horse. [echoing neighing] He desired that I learn to ride before I lost my sight, to experience the gift and joy of the journey. The day he passed away, my father went out and bought me my first horse. Through my grandfather, I was reminded that life is short, a precious miracle not to be wasted. When the world shut down, my heart turned from the grand concert halls to the quiet hills of my boyhood. I decided I would embark on a pilgrimage along the famous Via Francigena trail with my wife Veronica and a few close friends. We will explore the moments that inspire us and the music that unites us. [inspirational music] Together, we'll discover the gift and the joy of the journey. [birds chirping] [gentle music] [Andrea] Our journey begins in Rome. We will travel 200 miles to our home in Lajatico, along the paths the saints and the apostles traveled for the message of Jesus's birth, death, and resurrection. But, first, a blessing for the long road ahead. [chuckles] ["Petite Messe solennelle, Gloria: 2. Domine Deus" by Andrea Bocelli] ["Petite Messe solennelle, Gloria: 2. Domine Deus" continues] [birds chirping] [gentle music] [Andrea] Nature is one of life's greatest miracles. I find peace in the silence when I know I am alone with nature, alone with God. Great composers make room for silence in their music. We, too, should make room. [wind blowing] [inspirational orchestral music] Saint Augustine once said, "He who sings prays twice." That's how I feel when I hear my friend Tori Kelly sing, like I'm listening to the anthem of her soul. ["Soul's Anthem (It Is Well)" by Tori Kelly] ♪ My soul ♪ -Tori. It's... -[laughs] -Hi. -...it's so incredible to see you here. -[Tori] It's amazing. -I remember the first time that we sang together, we were in Milan, and I had to sing a song with you. I was completely without my voice. -No way. -Yeah, -I remember, I was sick. -What? I wouldn't have known. -[chuckles] -I was sick. [birds chirping] I don't know why, but whenever there's a beautiful lady, -his English comes right away. -[laughs] -With beautiful ladies, my English comes out. -[laughter] [Tori] What made you decide to go on this journey? Many years ago, two Italian musicians... ...did this, uh, journey from Milan to Rome... -Wow. -...by horse, you know? And this way it's the perfect place... ...where we can reflect. [Tori] Yes. [gentle music] What felt your heart in this last, uh, period? Mm, that's a good question. I've been thinking about hope just because it's something everybody needs. I mean, specially with this last year, there's been so much loss and so much pain and hurting and-- -This has been a terrible period for everybody... -Yeah. ...because many people lost the-- their hope. -Yes. -But... ...I think that it'll be like at the end of every war. After a terrible war, there is a beautiful period in which people wants to recover their life. [birds chirping] [Tori] I'd love to know a time that maybe you felt like you've lost hope. My career started when I was already... -...almost 35 years old. -Wow. And before, many times I heard "No." -Wow. -[Andrea] It's okay. [Tori] But you kept going. Yeah, absolutely, because I... ...I, I didn't sing for the career. I d-- I s-- I sang for myself, -always. -That's it, right there. I know, for me, like, music gives me hope, -a lot too when we... -Um, of course, -music, it's a big gift... -...when we sing. -Yes. Absolutely. -...by God, you know.

It's what first connected me and my wife Veronica, and it's what connected us with singer and songwriter Michael W. Smith. We all share a passion for music and creating opportunities for the next generation, artists like soprano Clara Barbier Serrano. ["Pianissimo" by Andrea Bocelli and Clara Barbier Serrano] [singing in Italian] ["Pianissimo" continues] ["Pianissimo" continues] ["Pianissimo" continues] [crickets chirping] [birds chirping] [organ music] We have this incredible gift to be able to share with the world this gift of music, and-- which I still think is the most powerful universal language in the world. One of the things that I feel like God has told me is I'm just supposed to tell the world that He loves them. People still feel like they have to earn it or they have to do this or do that, but the fact is He just simply loves them, and you wanna see the world change, and so do I. And I love doing that. I love sharing the hope of the world with people. ["Sing Again" by Michael W.

He's full of light and life. [Veronica] Good morning! [Tauren] Good morning. -Good to see you. -Great to see you too. It's beautiful. Should we ride a little bit here? -Yes. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. [Veronica] So, where are you from, Tauren? Where were you, now? I am from Texas. -Texas? -Yes. The country for the horse. -Yeah, the country of the horses. -Yes. But I had never ridden a horse. -Incredible. It's so strange. [chuckles] -Till today. Coming back, you, you will be more Texan. -[laughs] That's right. -Yeah. How's the journey been? Very well for now. -How many miles have you ridden? -Oh, many, many, many. One of the things that they told me, having never ridden before, was that the horse can sense... ...your energy. -Yeah. -[Veronica] Yes. Your fear -or your excitement. -Yeah. [Veronica] I think the horses are a little bit like the audience. It can smell, it can, uh, you know, really understand who it's facing. Whenever artists go through, uh, like, a very strong moment in life, we, as an audience, we can understand that. I found this, and I know that you found this in songs that you've written and performed. A lot of times, you're writing or performing from an emotion or from a place that you've been, something that you felt. And then, sometimes, you're singing in response to that emotion or that feeling. -So true. -There is a song that I put out recently -on my album Citizen of Heaven... -Uh-huh. -...and it's called "Until Grace." -Uh-huh. And it's a story that really comes from an honest place. I always thought that I would always live in this cycle of dysfunction and brokenness. And then, one day I met God's grace. -Uh-huh. -[Veronica] Mm-hmm. And it was in that moment that I realized that where there is truth, freedom is possible. And I finally dealt with myself in a real way, you know, and that's how I was able to write this song, "Until Grace." ["Until Grace" by Tauren Wells] ♪ Oh... ♪ ♪ I knew I was broken but there was no one ♪ ♪ That I could tell ♪ ♪ Mm, praying felt like I was throwing pennies ♪ ♪ In a wishing well ♪ ♪ And I started believing ♪ ♪ I was cursed to carry this weight ♪ ♪ I was listing the reasons ♪ ♪ Of why I should walk away ♪ ♪ Until grace called my name ♪ ♪ Oh, I didn't know I could be free ♪ ♪ Until grace found me ♪ ♪ Until grace ♪ ♪ Broke these chains ♪ ♪ Oh, I didn't know I could be free ♪ ♪ Until grace found ♪ ♪ Your grace found me ♪ -Great. Bravo. -[all] Woo-hoo. -[chuckles] -Bravissimo. -[clapping] -Well, the horse didn't buck me off, -so... -[Veronica chuckling] Woo-hoo! [birds chirping] [water softly lapping] And how was your life before the grace? Oh, as a kid, I was wild. -Oh, really? -[laughs] -Absolutely insane. -[laughs] I was always in class playing drums on the desk, being the class clown. You know, what I tell people now is I actually get paid to do all the things -that I got in trouble for doing in school. -[laughs] -I, I was a little bit naughty boy as well. -Yeah? I went, I went to the, uh, the same mass every, every Sunday with my family, and I, I went to play the, the organ, but before this, in mass, instead of to play the sacred song, -I played the pop music, you know? -[laughter] And the priest, the priest was very angry. I'm sure. You know, when I was in fourth grade, I had a teacher tell me, "Tauren, kids like you end up in jail." Oh, really? [Tauren] Not very positive. So, it's been kind of my purpose and my calling to have people not believe those negative voices, to raise the ceiling of what they believe is possible in their lives. And, you know, exactly as you were saying before, -everybody has his own place to be. -[Tauren] Yeah. And I'm sure mine was to push artists on stage. -To be up there, you need to have the right charisma... -Yes. ...and you need to be sure that what you're gonna share with the rest of the people it's something that comes from your heart and from God. So, Andrea thinks there are only two kinds of music, -the good music and the bad music. -[chuckles] And it's not because-- it is not the one you like or you don't like, it's more about what is good for the soul -and what unluckily brings you down. -But it's very logical because music influence the senses. Yes, we're not just singing from what we feel. We're singing from a place of faith in response to what we're feeling.

Taya, when did you start knowing that you really like to sing in life? Um, apparently, I was three years old, and I used to run around the house. Um, Mom would always say that I was just with a song in my heart. And then she politely says that I have never been quiet since. [laughs] So, are you happy about your song? -"Oceans"? Yes. -[Andrea] Yeah. -Did you like it immediately or-- -[Taya] I did. I, I actually, when, when we recorded it in the studio... -Yeah. -...I was just meeting everybody, and they told me I was just in to be background vocals. -Mm-hmm. -And I sang one song, and then they said, "Can you come back tomorrow?" And I only told two people that I sang on the record in case the song didn't make it. -It's a very beautiful song. -Thank you. -A-- and, and your voice, so sweet. -[chuckles] -Yeah, yeah. -You're, you're very kind.

[laughs] -Yeah. [Taya] Well, I feel like "Oceans" was a gift for me. It would become a faith statement -because I would stand on stages and platforms... -Mm-hmm. ...that I really felt like, like "Who am I to be here?" Then, yet, this song was all about trust and faith, so I had to learn how to live it whilst I was encouraging other people to do the same. [Andrea] Mm-hmm.

How did you, as a young woman, face that moment? Well... ...I definitely felt unqualified, and, yet I was like, "Well, God, I didn't put myself here. You placed me here."

[deeply exhales] "Dad, I thank you for making me rediscover such a beautiful word, 'pilgrimage.' We're all pilgrims with a stretch of road to travel every day. Those who have gone before us have left us precious clues through the most virtuous path, from Saint Peter's Square to the house of your grandparents in Lajatico, the valleys and path that together with Veronica you rode each day, the grass on which you walked, and the words and smiles you exchanged. Thank you for the invitation to us all to reflect, to return to the essential values of life. It's easy to forget them at the age of 20 or 70. Faith, family, love, forgiveness, hope, prayer, serenity, none of these can be sold or bought, which is perhaps why I hear so little about them. Today, more than ever, we need to understand this. So it is for this reason that I wanted to express my personal thank you and on behalf of those who, like me, try one step at a time each day to live a life that reflects these principles in our own personal journey. Matteo." Thank you very much. [Andrea] As a child, I would count down the days and hours until I could return to my family. To this day, the best part of every trip is the moment I cross the fields of Lajatico. And now I am almost home.
