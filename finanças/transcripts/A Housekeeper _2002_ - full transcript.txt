The Housekeeper YOUNG WOMAN SEEKS HOUSEKEEPING WORK One baguette, please. May I speak to the woman who left an ad in the bakery on Rue de Buci? Well, I need someone for housework, so I guess we should meet. Come to my house if you want. Or in a cafe. There's one across from the bakery. It's 10:20. Would 12:30 be all right? Fine. See you later. We'll find each other. Look around. See you later. Bye. Sit down. Something to drink? Mint tea? I'd like some coffee, please. Coffee, please! - So it's you? - Me what? You put the ad up for housework. Yes. - You do this elsewhere? - Yes. But I have some free time. - And it's a job you actually like? - Very much. Actually, I've never done it. - But I'm sure I'll like it. - You've never done it? But you'll like it? I like it when other people have clean houses. Excuse me, but... Excuse me, but you have dirt on your face. - There? - Yes. Is it gone? There's more here. Must be from watering my plants. - You live near here? - No, but I like the area. What's with your hair? I mean, it's all yellow, and... - I don't clean with my hair. - Of course. - What's your name? - Laura. We could give it a try if you want. Sure. How much do you charge? - I don't know. - How about 60 francs an hour? That's fine. I'll leave the keys with the super. Here's my address and the apartment number. If you can come Monday, that would be good. I won't be there but I'll call to see how it's going. No problem. - Monday, then. - Yes. Thanks. How's Leo doing? You're doing good, aren't you? - Hi, Ernest. - Jacques. - How you doing? - So-so. I'll have some punch for a change. How are you, Claire? Not great? I cried so much, I didn't want to go out. Look at my eyes. Look at this face. How about you? You could say I'm okay. Weekdays are fine at work, but weekends are long. I'm all alone, like a dog, counting the days since he left. 123. I tick them off in my diary. - How's my punch? - Not half bad. - Thanks, Ernest. - Ice? I'll take it straight up. It'll put me to sleep. - How are you? - Great. Doing really good. He lost his wife two months ago. Couldn't be happier. Yeah, but she didn't leave. She's dead. Wouldn't you rather see Constance dead - than off with some jerk? - No one said he's a jerk. I don't know the guy. This is Mr. Gautier. Am I disturbing you? Not at all. - Is everything okay? - Everything's fine. I started with the kitchen, because it was really dirty. - Now I'm sweeping. - Sweeping? Didn't you see the vacuum cleaner? Yes, but I prefer a broom. Oh. But a vacuum cleaner is more practical, no? I'd rather sweep. Okay, whatever you want. - Coming next Monday? - Right. - By then, it'll be dirty again. - The money's in the kitchen... four hours at 60 francs. I left 250 francs. - Don't bother with the change. - Well, actually... it's more than 4 hours, because it's really dirty. Write it down, and I'll pay next week. - Fine. - See you soon. Have a nice day. Bye. I WORKED SEVEN HOURS. YOU OWE ME THREE. THANKS, LAURA - Hello? - It's me. - Any progress? - Almost done with the bathroom. Okay. - Was it clean last time? - Very clean. Listen, Laura... - can I call you Laura? - That's my name. I thought it over. Monday is no good. The dust builds up during the week, and since I'm home on the weekends, I'd rather you come Friday, so the apartment's clean. - Yes, of course. - I'm no neat freak, but you could come twice a week, if you're free. To do some ironing. You could come on Mondays or Tuesdays, and on Fridays for the weekend. Monday and Friday. When should I iron? Whenever you think... See you Friday? - Okay. Friday. - Great. Want some coffee? Yes, please. I cleaned the bathtub. - Sugar? - No, thanks. No sugar. Sit down. - Here. - Thanks. - No work today? - Not on Fridays. The four-day work week, you know... It's good. Yeah, it's a blend. Wearing slippers? It's more comfortable. - Shouldn't I? - Sure, if you're comfortable. I'll put this here. - Everything okay? - Fine. You don't vacuum so you can hear the music? No, I just prefer sweeping. Come in. - Can I do the bedroom? - Sure, go ahead. I'm going out so you can work. You don't bother me. - I have an errand to run. - Okay. - See you later maybe. - Later. This heat... Can I talk to you? Of course. - How are you? - Not great. - Have a seat. - No, I'd rather stand. I don't have enough work. You want to come a third day? No, but if you know people... People... I do, but they clean for themselves, or they already have someone. The thing is, I can't pay my rent. How did you manage before? Well... - can I sit down? - Sure, go ahead. Actually... it's embarrassing. I don't know you. Here it is: The person I live with doesn't want me to stay and asked me to leave. Since it's over between us, - he thinks I should go. - I see. - It's for good? - Yes. - It's over? - Yeah. It's over. - It's hard? - Well, I have nowhere to go. I see. So... I was thinking... Sure, I understand, but... but I don't know anyone. I don't see who could... No. Actually, I thought... You thought what? I'm getting tired of this, okay?! Yes? You thought what? Actually, I know what you want. You want to live with me... - I mean, live here. - Until I find something. Sure, but... there's no room, and you're young. - Young? - No, I mean... there's not enough room. I'll sleep on the couch here. I didn't expect this. Well, I was just asking. I don't know. - So I can? - No, I don't know. Got a lot of stuff? I have no closet space. For a few days, maybe, but... - You saved my life! - Wait. Wait, wait. It won't work out with your friend? - I don't think so. - How many bags do you have? Two big ones. But I can leave them packed, under the bed. How will you get dressed if I'm sleeping? I'll wait. I'll sleep too. Besides work hours, I don't want you playing music. I promise. I have a walkman anyway. When will you be settling in? Tomorrow? Why not today? What's the difference? You're right. What's your first name? What? I couldn't hear you. - Your first name. - Jacques. I'll wait in the hallway. - You can stay here. - I'd rather not. - Don't. - Please. Are you sure? I don't mind the couch. No, I'd rather you take the bedroom. I'll feel more free. Sometimes I get home late. - I feel bad. - Don't feel bad. It's not like it's for life. As soon as I find something, I'll go. It's only for a few days. - See you later. - Okay. Want a light? Thanks. Can I buy you a drink? What will my dog Gary do? Will he take a running jump for another stunt, or will I play a nasty trick on him? What do you think? The stunt? Or the nasty trick? - The trick. I think... - You think I'm a meanie? - No... - You do! That's not nice! You're a... - A joker? - Yes, you are. Let's see what Gary does for you. Could you turn that down? - I can turn it off. - I'd rather you did. Someone called. A woman. I told her you went out. I told her I was the housekeeper. - She left a name? - I didn't ask. - Should I have? - It doesn't matter. - You're home early. - I'm neither late nor early, just home! Am I disturbing you? I heated up the rest of the stew. - Want some? - In a while, yes. - Want a drink? A cocktail? - Yes, please. - I'll serve. - No, I'll do it. - Scotch? Martini? - Martini. Cheers. Yes? - Need help? - No, I'm okay. Claire, it's me. Am I waking you? Do you need a cleaning lady? You do take good care of your cleaning lady! Poor kid. I feel for her. I'm trying to help her out. You want to get rid of her? - No. Why? - Seems like it. No, she needs more work. In addition to me. She needs more. More work. You know anyone? No, not anymore. Hey, don't you have a maid's room? - I rented it. Why? - Shit. The kid's getting kicked out. - Take her in. - Oh, no.

Go right ahead. HOUSEKEEPER AVAILABLE 4.90 francs, please. Who is it? One moment. Jacques, it's for you. It's Laura. Hold on one second, Laura. What's going on? Nothing. I didn't ask you what you wanted for dinner. I don't know. Whatever. I was peeling potatoes. I was thinking mashed potatoes and lamb chops. Sounds good? Sure. But less butter in the potatoes than last time. - I'm cutting down on fat. - Fine. I have to go. I'm working. - Bye. - See you tonight. - Were the potatoes good? - Very good. I ate them all. You bought me some Windex. Thank you. Excuse me. - I didn't hear you. - I didn't say anything. I'll get it. Constance? Who is this? I know it's you, Constance. Have you got something to say? Answer or I'll hang up. Now stop calling. Write if you want. Be simple. Forget me! Leave me alone! I'm forgetting you, so forget me and leave me alone! You hear me? It's over, sweetheart.

Why the calls? What do you want? I still love you. What? I didn't catch that. I can't live without you. You managed fine for the past five months. Forgive me. It didn't work out? That's why you're back? - I want to see you. - You see me now. - Don't take it badly. - Of course I take it badly. You show up, harass me on the phone... - Now go, please. - You don't understand. I want to see you again. You have someone? I'm staying with Lucie. There's a cafe on the corner. - Right. - I'll be there tomorrow at 7:00. Don't answer, don't take me back. I just want to finish what we started together. Even if I still love you, I won't see you again. Leave. You still love me. Please, go. See you tomorrow. What is it? What's going on? Nothing. Everything's fine. What are you doing? Leaving. - When? - Tomorrow. - For how long? - I've got two weeks vacation coming. - Where are you going? - I'll visit a friend in Brittany. - And me? - Make yourself at home. - You're leaving me? - No, I'm coming back. What's the matter? Don't cry. Why are you crying? I don't want to stay alone. Wait. Listen to me. Don't get attached to me, Laura. I don't love you and you don't love me either. I feel good with you. I like to make love with you. - Don't you? - Sure. Sure, but that's not enough. And you need to work more. - You said so yourself. - I only want to clean for you. You have to work for others too, and give up the broom. You have to become a pro. - You have to vacuum. - I will for you. The broom's fine for me. I mean, for you. Take me and I'll clean there. In that case... no, I can't take you. I want to be alone. I'll call you. I don't get it. Don't cry. Okay, I'll take you. - I'll do anything. - Don't say that. You should do something with your hair. I don't care about my hair. I'll cut it if you want. Hang on. I have to call my friend. I'll be right back. - What's that? - I'm taking it. - To the countryside? - Yes. You want to practice? Can we stop at a hairdresser's? No, you'll do it there. I want to get my hair done now, and arrive with it short. It's 8:00. They're closed. Do it tomorrow. There's no rush. I want to get my hair cut today. Why the rush to leave Paris? I need some air. Is it a woman? I'm going with you. Yeah, but... you said we weren't about love. It's about desire. That's a lot, right? I don't know. - I'd rather you hold on to the wheel. - I'm holding it. - I'm glad you came. - You are? Yesterday, you said no. That was yesterday. - I'd like to have kids some day. - Yeah? - Won't be with me. - Why not with you? Because I'm too old, and... you don't start by wanting kids. - You start by falling in love. - You're not old, and I love you. Come on. How can you say that? - "I love you"! - I do. And I'll wait for you to love me too. I'm in no hurry. You'd better get an apartment. No more making love? I didn't say that. - Never had kids? - No. There you go. There's one. Can we stop? We'll be late. Ralph's waiting. I've grown fond of your hair. I want to cut it now. Ralph! I was cleaning for your arrival, but the vacuum's broken. No suction. Those things are junk. Glad to see you. It's been awhile. Laura. - Ralph painted those. - You're a painter? A Sunday painter, seven days a week. - You only paint chickens? - Just about. Portraits of chickens. - You want to see my studio? - I'd love to. I paint them, and sell them too. That one's gorgeous. The silver Padua hen. I'm not working now. My boss gave me a vacation. - Good liqueur, huh? - Yes. Aren't you hungry? I made a Bresse chicken. Sounds good? Want the drumstick? No, thanks. I'm full. - No, really, I can't. - No takers? Then I will. We just ate him. The little Bresse chicken. I feel like I ate one of his relatives. - Ralph's gotten weird. - His chicken was good. Notice the smell in there? - It does stink a little. - Chicken shit. - We could give him the vacuum cleaner. - Of course. - At least we didn't come empty-handed. - Right. You love me? You love me? Say it. I love you. - Let's take a dip. - I'll go later. - No. Let's go. - I'll join you later. Come on! No, it's too cold. You surprised me. - You okay? - It's hot. I'd better buy a hat. Come on up! Did you have fun, lovebirds? - How was the water? - Really cold. The water's great. You're always cold. - You didn't swim? - A little. I hate the beach. Too big, no shade, too crowded. I like streams. But it was okay. - You don't like anything. - I do. - Me? - She's so silly. - You see Claire? - Yes, often. We had dinner last week. She calls me regularly. She might come. That would do her good. She's really shaken up. Rough time. Remember how pretty she was? Yeah. Still is, actually. I had a thing for her back then. - Didn't you? - No. We've always been friends. I was always on the chase. - But I've calmed down. - You're not eating the claws? There's lots of meat in them. You break one, then suck on it. See all the meat? Thanks for the vacuum cleaner. - You knew mine was busted? - Intuition. You look very much in love. You're lucky. Thanks. Sure you won't come? No, it's hot. It's too hot. - I'm going to read. - Then I'll go alone. You're wearing a wedding ring? When did you buy that? I didn't. - Can I see that? - Sure. Where'd you find it? I went to look at Ralph's room. There was a dusty shelf. I found it there. I saw your name on it, so I put it on. Now it's like we're married. Was it wrong? - Should I put it back? - No, keep it. I'm going. See you later. - Oh it's you? - Yes, it's me. You know what Laura found here? My wedding ring. - She's a snoop. - Can you explain? - I knew Constance before you. - Who cares? She didn't have my ring. Listen, Jacques. I lived in Gordes. You know? The hell with the past! What about my ring? Calm down. Two months ago, Constance called. It had been years. She was all hung up on you. She came here for a few days. I guess she left the ring. In your bedroom? You think I'm an idiot? So she left me for you! I wondered who. I can't believe it was you. No. It was someone else. She came here afterwards. - Who? - I don't know. - She didn't talk. - You just fucked. - And your chickens? - What? - How did Constance like them? - I don't get the connection. Do I put the ring back in the room? No keep it. Wear it. It's yours now. - What if he notices? - Who cares? You don't have one. I'd like it if you had one. - This one? - I'll try it on. This one's better, yes. - You like this one? - Yeah. Yes, but... it's not exactly the same as mine. No big deal. You'll put my name inside? No, I'll wear it as it is. It's so nice here. Give me a big house with chickens, and I stay here for good. You guys can stay as long as you'd like. - I'll leave you my room. - Hear that? We can stay and have his room too! Nice. We could share everything as friends. - Let's stay. - Yeah, sure. I'll find a job here... mussel gatherer, oyster taster. He'll paint his chickens. - You'll clean houses. - Fine with me. I'm going to bed. - Good night. - Wait for me. I'm not sleepy. - Want to go dancing? - At this hour? It's not late. I feel like dancing. - Please? - I can't dance for shit. For me? - Claire! What are you doing here?! - I was sick of Paris. - Did you know I was here? - No. - I've been here 10 days. - Really? - Where? - At Ralph's. He invited me too. But his place stinks of chickens. - A hotel is fine. - Drink? Not yet. Want to dance? - Please. - You know I don't dance. You go ahead, I'll wait here. - Go ahead. - No! - I'll have a Diet Coke. - You on the wagon? I'm trying. A Diet Coke, please. - You okay? - Yeah. - You look better. - Yeah. I'm starting to breathe. Claire, this is my friend Laura. A friend. - Come dance with me? - You know I can't. Come on, please. Please? I want to dance. So, who's that woman? She's an old friend. - Not that old. - I've known her 15 years. She's on vacation. She's a friend of Ralph's too. She's not staying with him? She doesn't like chicken shit. She prefers a hotel. Am I still your lover? Of course. Then kiss me. Was that a kiss? Come on, Laura! We're going back in two days. - Already? - Yes. - I thought we were staying. - That was nonsense. Ralph says that. I go back to work on Monday. We'll come again. Paris is nice. It's not the same. In Paris, I'm your housekeeper. I want to stay. I feel good here. Aren't they cute? I met someone. I know. I saw you together. Anything else? I like him. What about us? I like you too. Got a preference? - It's different. - Better? - I didn't say that. - Then what is it? He's younger? - That's not it. - You just prefer him on the whole. Is he a local? Come on, tell me. I'm seeing him tomorrow. So? - I want your blessing. - You won't get it. What would my blessing mean? - Give me back the ring. - I don't have it. I lost it swimming. It was too big. There. I lost mine too. - I'll do what you say. - That means nothing. Do what you want to do. Jacques... - Julien. - Hi. I'm Julien's mom, Helene. Hi. - How about a swim? - Okay. Coming, Mom? No, go ahead. I want to get some sun. I'll go in later. You all right? - No, not really. - Sit down. Can I do something? It'll pass. It's just the sun. All that meat jiggling. You're a cheerful guy. - Are you? - Me? Not really. I'm getting divorced. - Ever been through one? - No. Not yet. You're lucky. Sorry. It's all I talk about. My husband contends it's my fault. - 17 years for that. - You left him? I left, but it didn't work out. Did you try to... go back? - Yes. - Too late? - You live around here? - No, I'm on vacation. I am too. I rented a cottage. - Yeah? Any good? - It's all right. It's nice of you to listen. Not many people can listen. Come for a swim? I'm not feeling well. It'll do you good. Come on. The water's nice. Coming? - I'll wait. The water's cold. - No. Come on. Come on in! It's cold. Come on! The water's nice. I have a cramp! You okay? Take it easy. Thank you very much. - Thank you, sir. - Don't mention it. He's a nice guy. - I feel better. - Shake it a little. Is that better? Let's sit down. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Fine, thanks. - Smack it a little. Is it over? I got scared. Yes, it's rough. - Never had a cramp like that. - It really hurts. - But I'm okay now. - Your daughter's back. She's a doll. Hi, guys!
