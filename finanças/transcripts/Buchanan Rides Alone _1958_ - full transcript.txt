Hey, Lew! Do you want to check this one? He don't look like much. Hey mister! - Morning. Ride over here and get off your horse. He told you to get down. What for? - I'll ask the questions. Go ahead. I can hear you fine, right from where I'm sitting. Mister, I don't want to have to shoot you off that horse. And I sure wouldn't want you to, Sheriff. Check his saddle bags first. Wasting your time! Only thing I've got on me is worth a hoot is this here gun belt. Sure, give me the price of a good meal and a night's lodging and you can have this whole caboodle. What do you say? Somebody chasing you, Roy? You did that on purpose, Lafe. Why don't you grow up, Roy? What's the matter with him? Same old thing, getting himself in trouble across the line. Where you heading, mister? - West Texas. West Texas! Ha! I should have known it! You know one West Texan can always spot another West Texan by the way he sets his horse, or walks down the street. Or totes his gun. I'm from West Texas. Name's Pecos. Glad to know you. - This one isn't carrying nothing, Lew. We get enough drifters coming across the border I wouldn't linger in Agry Town if I was you. I don't linger no place until I get back where I belong. You're the man to see, I want to get a room. Cost you $10. In advance. Well, I'm not staying a week, I just want a room for the night. Well, it will still cost you $10. I've got some tens in here somewhere. I... I could change one of them fifties for you, sir. You sure it wouldn't be too much trouble? - Oh, not at all, sir. There you are, mister er...? - The name's Buchanan. Your room is the first one at the head of the stairs. I'll use it later. Where can I get something to eat? They'll fix you up with a good steak across at the saloon. Oh, Mr Buchanan, a border town ain't no place to go walking around I'd advise you to leave it with me in the safe. It's safe right where it is. Be sure to tell Nacho that Amos Agry sent you. You related to him? He's my brother. The Sheriff is my brother too, his name's Lew Agry. Looks like you got mighty high connections? Morning, dad. Don't you ever do that again! I'll do it every time you go chasing across the border. I'll settle for a lot but not another woman. - What are you talking about? Where d'you get those scratches? - I rode through some brush. Looks like you tried to ride through some Mexican wildcat. Roy! When you leave, you get me that bottle of whiskey. I can't do it, your father gave me strict orders. Get me that bottle or I'll come back there and take it! I can't do it, Roy. - How about me? I was told I could get some whiskey and a good steak here. You watch out who you're pushing. Looked like you were arguing and wasn't getting you anywhere I don't want no steak that's out and out raw, I want the middle on the red side. This ain't a very friendly town. If I was you I would get out of here quick. That was Roy Agry you just hit, mister. Ain't there anybody in this town that ain't an Agry? Please go, senor. While I'm waiting for that steak I'll buy a bottle. Of that one. What I don't drink I'll take with me. How much? - $10. The steak? - $10. Good thing I'm only staying over the night. Sure is a $10 town. Hey, kid! How about a shot of this? Maybe you need it. Hold it, son, I built up a small hanker myself. Nacho, you're fixing up trouble for yourself. Amos, I didn't give him the bottle, he gave it to him. He certainly looked like he could use a drink. He ain't no son of mine. I'd appreciate it if you'd bring that bottle back here. Do you know what I'm gonna do? If you keep pulling on that bottle I do. When I finish this, I'm gonna kill you. Now that's just Jim Dandy, son. But in the meantime, would you mind bringing me my steak? Oh-ooh. What do you want? You've got to get over the saloon right away. - What for? Roy's been drinking and he says he's gonna kill a fella. Roy ain't got guts enough to kill nobody. Maybe not sober, but when he's been drinking there ain't nothing What's it to you what Roy does? - Well, he's our nephew, ain't he? Besides, that fella's carrying a lot of money, I've seen it. Lew, if you ain't gonna stop him I'm gonna tell Simon. Stop worrying, Roy ain't gonna kill nobody. - Lew, I tell you... Shut up and get out of here. Oh... 'A lot of money.' Who did we miss, Waldo? Let's finish the hand and go find out. Put one of these on the wall right above the bar, Nacho. You might put another one over here. It's not my fault, Mr Carbo. I did not serve Roy the whiskey. Didn't say you did. Roy is going to kill him. He is? Well... Mighty tasty steak. - Thank you, senor. Anybody wants me I'll be over at the hotel getting some shut-eye. The name's Buchanan. Quite a town! Roy Agry! Do not do this, boy. Take it easy son, he's drunk. Stay where you are. No, Palito, no. Please! Please go back home. I will after I kill him. If you kill him you will never see your home again. Stay out of there. Take him over to the jail house and wait for him to come to. When I hang a man I like him to know what's going on. So they got Roy. I told you what was gonna happen. You told me! You couldn't have been more wrong. You said he was going to kill somebody. - He was. Nacho, tell the undertaker to get his wagon over here. I guess I better tell Simon. Don't be gone too long or you'll miss the hanging. You ain't never seen a double hanging! You're gonna hang Mr Buchanan? - That's right. The way I figure, he and the Mex were in this together. How much do you figure's in that purse, Lew? - Well, it's hard to say. If it wasn't for me you wouldn't have known he was csarrying that money. Don't worry, I'll cut you in for your share. - How much? This doesn't seem like a likely time to be haggling over money, especially when it doesn't belong to you, Lew. I guess I better go break the sad news to Simon. I'll take care of that, Amos. Sshhh. Try to understand, as soon as they hear us, they'll swing us from the nearest tree. Comprende? I understand English, senor. I am grateful for what you did, but I'm sorry I brought you trouble. We both got trouble, big trouble. For me it does not matter. Roy Agry is dead. Why did you kill him? Cannot tell you, senor. The name's Buchanan, what's yours? Sorry, but I would rather not say. That's all right. We ain't got much time to get acquainted anyway. Come on! - All right, Lew, what are we waiting for? We're still waiting for 'em to wake up. Here, go check on 'em. Get up. Morning, Nina. Where's the Judge? Anyone ever tell you you're a mighty handsome woman? - Many thanks, senor. When are you gonna leave the Judge and work for me? The Judge treats me very well. - I can treat you better. Why should I leave a man of Judge Agry's position to work for you? That's for you to answer, beautiful. And remember if you wait too long I may not want you. Morning, Simon. - Morning. Nina! Bring another glass. I already have it, senor. I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, Simon. - Oh? Yeah? What's happened now? Roy has been... shot. Roy, dead. It was inevitable. Who did it? A young Mexican. Looks like a man named Buchanan helped him. Did they get away? No. Simon, you'd better get down to the jail before they string him up. Lew has everybody primed for a lynching. You're smart, you'll stop it. Why should I do that? Because everybody in these parts knows that Simon Agry stands for law and order. A lynching could cost you a lot of votes, Simon. Aside from the fact the young man's name just happens to be Juan de la Vega. Don Pedro's son? Why? Ask me, I'd say the old gentleman might be willing to part with a lot of pesos to get his son back safe. You're right. Can't have no lynching with me coming up for election. Sheriff, you are making a big mistake! You cannot hang Senor Buchanan, he had nothing to do with it. I killed Roy Agry. Yeah, and he helped you. - That's right, Lew. No, you're wrong. He had nothing to do with it. Save your breath, kid. Nobody's listening to you. I am truly sorry, senor. So am I. All right, string 'em up. Wait! Take those men back to jail! These men are heading for the cemetery. Do as I say, take those ropes off their necks. Please listen to me. My only son has been killed. A son I held very dear to my heart. Who among you has a better reason for wanting to see those murderers hang? None of you. I personally would like to put the noose about their neck, but the law forbids it. You all know that I'm a law-abiding man. It's my solemn duty to see that they get a fair trial. That's just what they're gonna get tomorrow morning at nine o'clock. Now the sheriff here is gonna take these men back to jail. And I want all of you to go home. Please, gentlemen! We must see that justice takes its proper course. And I shall personally be for ever grateful to you. All right, take the ropes off. Senor Buchanan, why did you help me? Because you needed it. I wish my father could meet you, so he could thank you for what you did. Tell me, who is your father? Well, who is he? Don Pedro de la Vega. I'm Juan de la Vega. The whole of Mexico thinks a lot of your dad. You've heard of him? Lots, all good. He's a fine man. And he has a fine son. I saw those scratches on Roy's face. Was she your wife? I am not married. Your sister then? Look, Jonny, you've gotta tell 'em. Nobody would hang you for killing a man who did a thing like that. No-one must ever know, Buchanan. All right, quiet everybody. This here trial is about to start. Now Jim here is going to pass among you with a tray and the Judge wants me to have you put all your glasses in that tray, empty. Judge don't want no more liquored up opinion like he had in that last trial. Now sit down some place and take off your hats. Come on, stand up for the Judge. Come on, Charlie! Well, sit down. All right, this here court is now in session, Judge Simon Agry presiding. Waldo, bring in the prisoners. Bring in the prisoners! Put that gavel down. Sit down. Sit down. Sit down! I see the defendants have no legal representation. We don't need no lawyer, Judge. What is your full name? - Tom Buchanan. What is your full name? I killed Roy Agry, that is all you have to know. Your name is Juan de la Vega. Stand up, Buchanan. He had nothing to do with it. Sit him down. Where do you hail from, Buchanan? West Texas. Where are you headed? - Back home. What's your occupation? Well? Well, I'm trying to think. It seems to be quite a chore. I ain't much of a thinker, Judge. I grew up chasing cows. Whose cows? My dad's. Until the drought and the bank wiped us out. What then. - I ramrodded some, a little border spread, and then I got some ideas about owning for my own, so I crossed the line and tried to stake myself some animals. By rustling? No, sir. Fighting. Oh, so you're a fighter? - Yes, sir. What kind of fighting? Almost any kind, provided there's money in it. I joined General Campos in Mexico. Then murder is nothing new to you, Buchanan. Ain't murder when you're killing a revolution. Why aren't you still there? Revolution petered out. Besides I... I got myself a stake. I see. According to this charge, you're an accessory to the murder of Roy Agry. How do you plead? Your son getting shot is no business of mine. You got any questions, Lew? Yeah. Mister, wouldn't you say you made your living as a gunman? I've turned a dollar with a gun. And you put in a lot of jail time? - I've been in jail. So the fact is you were just another hard case on the dodge? You could say that. Tell the Judge here about the fight you picked with Roy just before he was shot. Nothing to tell. Nothing to tell! You knocked him down and when he got up you got him drunk. He was a man full-grown, I offered him a drink, but he took the bottle. He was still working on it when I left. Ah... Isn't it a fact of the case that you were the advance agent in this killing? Weren't you sent into town to either goad Roy into a gunfight or get himself drunk he couldn't defend himself? But the plan misfired, didn't it? You two did the killing all right, but the Mex here ran smack into the law and you came and tried to break him free. I saw this boy here getting a licking from this big ape, so I dealt myself in. I figured it was one thing I could do in this town and it wouldn't cost me 10 bucks. Oh, you don't like this town. - I don't like some of its people. Me included? - You especially. Oh, you'd like to kill me maybe? I'd like to give you what you and your boys gave me. Take the law into your own hands, is that it? - No. Just you. Well, that's the case, Judge. He's a gunman that came into town yesterday to set it up for this boy here to kill Roy. I never saw this boy in my life before yesterday. I didn't have nothing to do with the killing. Anybody got any more to say? You've all heard the evidence, now you've got to decide whether Buchanan was or was not an accessory to the murder of Roy Agry. You can go out to the back room and talk it over. You folks sit down until they get out of here. Have you reached your verdict? Not guilty, Your Honour. Since you've been found innocent, your presence in this courtroom Ivy, escort Mr Buchanan back to the hotel. I'm glad for you, Buchanan. Juan de la Vega, stand up. You are charged with the murder of Roy Agry, my son. How do you plead? - I killed your son and I'm glad. There ain't no point in prolonging this trial, Simon, he admits he killed him, so there ain't nothin' we gotta prove. You heard the defendant confess that he killed Roy Agry. As Judge, I have no alternative except to direct you to bring in I don't think we have to go anyplace to cast our vote, Judge. Juan de la Vega, you've been found guilty by a jury of 12 freeholders At an hour before sunset this very day, you will be hung by the neck Court is adjourned. I don't care what you say, this ain't no fair share and you know it. It was only 300, Amos. - You're lying. You shouldn't call your brother a liar, Amos, it's all the money the Well, maybe you can fool them but you can't fool me, if I don't get at least ten more of these things, Simon is gonna get an earful. Amos, you start playing Simon and me against each other, you're gonna get Here comes Buchanan. Sheriff, I'll make a deal with you. You let the boy go and you Hear that, Waldo? He's trying to bribe me. He's a real bad one. No respect at all for the law. Want me to lock him up? No. I'll forget what you just said, Buchanan. Now get back on that horse of yours and start riding out of town. I'd like to see the boy first. Hello, Jonny. - I'm very glad to see you again, Buchanan. I thought this might help. Thank you. It was an honour knowing you, Buchanan. It was an honour knowing you. Would you do something for me? - If I can. Would you ask them to let my horse go, just let him loose at the bridge, We'll take care of the horse for you. Well... so long Jonny. Goodbye, Buchanan. Where's my gun? A law-abiding citizen like you don't need no gun. Give me my belt. - You're getting it. Now you saw the kid, git. Lafe and Pecos will ride out with you. - I don't need an escort. You're getting one anyway. I'm making sure you don't Sheriff, I had $2,000. - We were voted out of a double hanging, Buchanan. Unless you get on that horse and start riding, we'll make up I'll be back. - Lafe, you and Pecos try real hard Don't you worry about it, Lew. Waldo, you better go back to the hotel and sit with Amos He might have heard something that upset him. Amos. I've been looking for you, hop in. He can't. He's got some things to do in the hotel. Nothing that can't wait until tomorrow. I think he ought to stop by and talk to Simon, a man likes to have his You might mention that to Lew. Get up. Funeral is set for noon tomorrow. Fine. What's he doing here? A couple of loose guns just rode out of town with Buchanan, Well, Amos, why? Lew, how come you sent Buchanan out of town under two guns? You afraid of Buchanan, Lew? There ain't a man in this world I'm afraid of. Is that a fact? - Yeah, that's a fact. Look, Lew, I don't mind you stealing a few dollars from the trash but don't get ambitious and start trying to buck me. Lew wouldn't try to buck you, Simon. Star isn't permanent on your chest. I put it there and I can take it off. - You want it back now Simon? No. We haven't had any real differences yet. I want both of you to be at the funeral tomorrow. As Roy's uncles, a few tears certainly wouldn't be out of place. How are we going to work up any tears over Roy? Just be sure you rise to the occasion. I didn't tell him nothing, Carbo seen Buchanan riding out of town, Lew, there was $2,000 in that purse, Mr Buchanan said so. Sure he did. He was standing right there on the porch, Gracias. Well, not many fathers feel about their sons the way you did. This trial could do you a lot of good, Simon, might even make you Governor of California some day. Senor Agry? Yes. Senor Agry? - Yes, who are you? Esteban Gomez. - Won't you come in, please? This is Mr Carbo, Senor Gomez. What can I do for you? - I've come to purchase the That is impossible, he has been convicted of murder, I'm sorry to hear that, senor, I will return to Don Pedro and tell him his generous offer has been rejected. - Well, just a moment, senor, since you've come such a long way I see no harm in discussing it. Gracias. Well? - Don Pedro will deliver to you 30 of his How could I explain how I came by these fine horses? I couldn't. - It's a very generous are blooded stock, they are some of the finest horses in the world. I'm sure they are. But the fact remains that Juan de la Vega will be hung this very $50,000 in American money. Senor... - I have nothing more to say. Judge, I think Senor Gomez should be allowed to take the boy's body back with him so he can be buried in his own country. It's a very kind suggestion. You will be permitted to do this. I do not think Don Pedro can raise that much money, senor. I'll give him 48 hours to see if he can. - 48... 48 hours. You're a very difficult man, senor. Lew, the hanging is temporarily postponed. Why? Because Simon wants it that way, that's why. When it's on again I'll let you know. I wonder what Simon's got up his sleeve. I don't know but whatever it is, that kid's going Might be making a big mistake, Lew. Why? - Well, Simon never was one If I was you, I'd find out what it is. Town crier always knows something. How much further are you boys going to ride along with me? A ways. That where you going to kill me? What do you get paid for a job like this? Fifty? Not over a hundred. Not much more than that. For a West Texan, you do killin' awful cheap, Pecos. Buchanan, what was you planning to do with that $2,000? You know that country up around Endicott? I sure do. Well, I had my eye on a spread up there but I never could get me a big I'd love to have my spread back there, Then how come you're in California? Settle footed. This country is so dang big a man just gets used to moving around, so one day I got tired of watching the sun go west but I ain't itchin' no more. Before long I'll follow the sun right on back to where I come from. Sounds like you put a lot of store in being a Texan. A man's got to be loyal to something. That's the same way I feel. You come on back here. Buchanan, I want you to know I don't cotton none to this job. A man oughtn't do a job he don't cotton to, Pecos. Forget it. Right there, Buchanan. A step down. Take its saddle off. Put it down. Don't turn around. Who's going to do the shooting? Both of us. Lafe why don't we just? - Shut up, Pecos. I ain't got no more stomach for this than you have, Thanks, Pecos. L- A-F-E, Lafe. I sure hope old Lafe ain't put out with us for stashing him With animals all around it seems the only decent thing, don't you think? Anyways, that hole you dug is done chock full of water, wouldn't hold nothing but a fish. Lafe, you and me worked for Lew Agry for nigh on a year and though I don't guess we was ever real buddies, I'm sorry it was me You had your good side, Lafe, but you had your bad side too, like cheatin' at stud and emptying my But I ain't holding these things agin' you and if you're holding a grudge agin' me, Lafe, just remember that between you and Buchanan here, I just had to choose Buchanan Like I always say, let bygones be bygones and I hope you're Well, so long, Lafe, you died real good. - Amen. I sure got myself in one of them predicaments, I don't Pecos, how do you like to be half owner in that spread of mine? You mean that? - Sure do. Yeah, but you ain't got that $2,000 no more. - I'll get it back. Huh! Waldo and Lew will shoot you on sight. Me too. - I'll take you in as partner whether you'll Oh, would you? Buchanan, that's real nice of you, I know just Why would I be making a big mistake, Amos? You mean about going ahead with the hangin'? - Yeah. What's Simon up to? Why don't you ask him? - I'm asking you, Amos. You don't pay too good for information, Lew. Oh, how much do you want? I ain't greedy, Lew, all I want is 10,000, you can have all the rest. All the rest? And how much would that be? - 40,000. Dollars. Well, you've just got yourself a deal, brother. Now, how am I going to get my hands on all this money? Well, sometime in the next 48 hours, a Mexican is going to bring $50, 000 to Simon for the release Now all you have to do is figure out some way to keep that Yeah. Amos, you go over to the saloon and tell Hamp and Ivy to What are you going to do, Lew? I'm going to spit right in Simon's eye. There's the shack and right behind it you will find a trail that will run you right into Agry Town. Change your mind about going back? I was thinking about young Juan. - It will be sundown That's bad luck all the way around. Say, I got some coffee & bacon in my pack if you've a mind to eat before you start back. All right, Lew. Hop in, kid. Drive slow out of town, Ivy. When you get to the shack once, if everything looks all right, you can back as fast as you can All right, Mex, get out of there. Ivy, you ride the kid's horse. - What's the matter, can't you handle him? Sure you can? Come on, get up. Senor, you hurt my horse again, I swear one day I will kill you. There's supposed to be nobody living in that old shack. Howdy, fellas, what in tarnation brings you out here? How come the kid's still alive, I figured he'd be hung Lew told you he wanted the job done, why didn't you do it that way. Well, we done just like Lew said. What's Buchanan's horse doing here. Only thing you were supposed to bring back with you was a saddle. Well, after we killed him... Ain't no sense in my lying to you Waldo, when it come down to that poor dumb animal I just What did you stop off here for? - Well, after all that riding we Where's Lafe? - He went out hunting he will be back anytime now. What did you bring him for? Simon and the kid's pa made a deal with Simon that he'd pay him Lew figured it don't make no difference to his pa who he paid the money to as long as the kid went on living. So Lew decided to do a ransom deal. Looks like Lew's really bucking the big men this time. Oh, there was bound to have a showdown sooner or later. Yeah, like you said, it was bound to happen. Lafe get a boot out of shooting Buchanan? - Yeah, he got a kick out of it. Ain't never minded shootin' nobody. Sit down, kid, if there's any food left over, we'll give you You three stay like you was. I never expected to see you again today, Buchanan. I didn't never expect to see you ever. Don't move. You three sit down. Get the rope. Throw me the rifle. Jonny, you and Pecos tie them up, except for Waldo. Drag 'em off. Stand up. Waldo, I've been remembering that fight we had out in the saloon. How long were you supposed to stay here with Jonny? Till Lew comes. Well, what are we gonna do now? First, tie him up and then fix us some food, then I... I ain't sure. When you think Lew will be showing up? Ain't your toe sore yet? Lew will be here as soon as he gets the ransom money Who's this Gomez? He's ranch foreman for my father. I hope he's smart enough not to turn the money over Gomez is very smart, Buchanan. - Good. I'll ride with you as far as the border, come on. Be seein' you. You cut us loose and I'll forget about you siding with Buchanan. Oh, you would never forget that, Waldo. Why, if you got the chance, you'd cut my heart out Well, like the man said, be seeing you. Didn't I just say goodbye to you? Yes, sir, you did. But I've got to think about what I'd do when Lew got here. Well, what do you want to do? I know a place where Juan can cross the border without no chance and I'd be much obliged if I could ride along with you. All right, Pecos. - But I still ain't going back into Agry Town, ever. Lew's going to kill us when he finds out the kid got away. Well, here we are, that's your country. Guess this is where we part company, Jonny. Please, do not return to Agry Town. Come to the hacienda with me, He will be very happy to make up your losses. I'll make up my own losses. I must do something to repay you for all you have done. If you must go back to Agry Town, let me go with you. You really want to do something for me? - Name it and it's done. Start riding and don't stop till you get home. He named it, kid. - So long, Jonny. Pecos, ride a ways to see that he keeps going south. I will be waiting right here for you, Buchanan, and good luck. Juan! Hup! What's the matter with you? - I couldn't have missed him. Look at Buchanan leaving. You know something, Jonny? Looks like this time I let my big mouth talk me into real trouble. Tell Buchanan... All right, boy, mount up. We're going back to town. Lew, I want to know what's holding up the hangin'. Simon's orders. You all saw how broken up poor Simon What's that got to do with it? If your son was killed you'd want to see his murderer You'll just have to wait until Simon's feeling better. Simon. Simon, wake up. I know the funeral's been a chore, but I think this might make you feel better, Your Money Man's here. I have fulfilled your wish, senor. Fine. Now if you'll just turn over the money. I will turn over the money when you turn over Juan de la Vega. What's the matter, don't you trust me? - No, senor. How do you know you can trust him? We haven't seen the money, how do we know he's got it? And I believe you. Carbo, bring the boy back here. Senor Gomez, as you say in Spanish, mi casa, su casa. Make yourself at home. Lew! Carbo just pulled up behind the jail, I think he's lookin' for you! But... Amos, ever since this happened you've been running around like a How about I buy you a drink? Lew. What do you want, Carbo? Keys to the jail cells. Oh, sure. Lew, you just made the biggest mistake of your life. You'd better make it right before it's too late. - I ain't made no mistake. I ain't goin' no place. - We're going to Simon's. You two Now, what would Simon and me have to hash over? Where's the kid? Ah. Well, you just tell Senor Gomez that if he's got any trading to do I'm the man to see, because Simon ain't got nothin' to trade. You know, Carbo, now that I've gone into business for myself I might not have time for this sheriff business any more. You keep this up, Lew, you're going to wind up in a box alongside Roy. Hah! Put your hands on the top of the desk. And, Sheriff, would you mind opening up that safe? You kill me, Buchanan, ain't nobody going to open that safe. You know something, Sheriff, it just might be worth it. Hand me my gun belt. Gentle. Haul out my money and count it over here on the table. Put it in stacks of $500, it'll be quicker that way. Lew! Everybody's getting riled up, they're going to come down here... Ahh... Hello, Amos. Give Lew a hand countin' up my money. How much is there? 1,700. You'd better start diggin'. Get out with that 50, Amos. It's all that's left, Buchanan. - Put it back in my belt. Amos, you were saying something when you came in. Because we ain't hung the kid yet. They say if Lew don't they will. Lew, you'd better get on back up to the saloon, looks like you're gonna have to do some mighty fast talkin'. Lew, Lew! what do you think they're gonna do when find out the kid in jail? They won't find out till after I get that 50,000. - What are you gonna do? Find Gomez. It's time we talked business. - How are you gonna find Gomez? Very simple, I'm going to look for him. if he wants that kid back, he just might be looking for me! Lew. We've waited long enough. And we ain't waitin' any longer. If you don't get on with it, the men will take care of it themselves. That's what I come in here for. You all know Simon won't like missing the hanging, so we'll wait, but if he don't show up soon we'll go ahead without him. Whiskey for everybody on me, Nacho. Drink up, fellas, I'll be back. Set 'em up, Nacho. OK, drink up, everybody. I thought I told you to go home. I couldn't help it, Buchanan. That's right, he couldn't help it. Now you can do one of two things. You make a break for it and we shoot you both in the back or you can toss over them guns. Go get the keys. We're sure makin' progress. Buchanan, they killed Pecos. What are you all doin' here? - We had a little trouble. Where's Lew? He's in jail with Buchanan. I asked you where Lew was. Ain't he busy? I cannot understand why you do not deliver Juan to me, senor. We can't deliver the boy in broad daylight, the town's I am impatient, senor. I have fulfilled my part of the contract. I will leave now. When you are ready to return Juan to me, you will discover Might as well face it, Simon, you're going to have to kiss Lew's holding the trump card. Lew never saw the day he could outfox me. And nobody ever saw me kiss $50,000 goodbye. Come in. Well, Amos, what is it? - Well, I was just lookin' for Lew. You were? You should have known better than to Mixed up in what? I haven't got any time to waste. Where's Lew hiding the kid? What are you talkin' about? I don't know what... I don't know nothin'. Now, where's the kid? In jail. - Don't lie to me! I'm not lyin' to you! He's back in jail, I'm tellin' you the truth. I believe you, Amos. Does Lew know he's back? I don't think so. He's lookin' for Gomez. I was just lookin' for Lew. Thank you, Amos. Ho! Ho! Ho! You kept us waitin' a long time, Simon. It's about time we stretched Hold on, we can't have an official hanging until the sheriff is there. Where is Lew? - He's in the back room. You won't be able to talk 'em out of a hanging this time. After we get the money, that's Lew's responsibility. Well, I... Senor Gomez, you would be a very foolish man to believe anything Gomez, don't let the judge here smooth-talk you. He don't know He's in jail, where he's always been. Now, if you'll just hand over the saddle bag, I promise you that I will hand the money over to no-one until the boy is handed over to me. Come on, Simon, what's keeping you and Lew? - How long do we have to wait, Lew?! Now, I don't blame you for being impatient. We'll be right there. If you believe me, you lose your $50,000 and save the boy's life. If you believe Lew, Juan dies. Well, which way's it gonna be? I will believe you only when I see the boy. All right, Senor Gomez. Why don't you walk with him over to the jail? Incidentally, I've authorised Mr Carbo to receive the money Well, Lew, I wonder which one of us is going to be right. See Lew? Lew, can I see you a min... Waldo, you're a fool! Simon? Turns out that you were right. But I think we can change that. - Let go of me, Lew! Juan, I'm letting you go. I didn't expect to find you here, Buchanan. Come on. We could use a gun. Hey! Excuse me, senor. The carriage! Buchanan! Get up! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot, you'll hit Simon! Buchanan, look. Lew, look, the saddle bag! - I ain't blind. Lew... bring out Gomez. Gomez is all right. Lew Agry? I hear ya! - Tell everybody to move back up the street, If you don't, I'm gonna shoot the judge. That ain't no loss. You heard him! He means it, Lew! - And if we do you're releasing Simon? You have my word on it. All right, Gomez, beat it. If he makes a move for that saddle bag, shoot him. Hold it. Buchanan, he isn't going any further until you let Simon go. Tell him not to get nervous, Judge. Let him keep on walking, Lew! All right, Gomez, move on. Juan! - Esteban! Estas bien? Judge, now you go on out there, pick up that saddle bag Pick it up and come right back! Run this way, Simon! Come on! Now, Lew, you got any more ideas on how to get that saddle bag? Yeah. A real good one. Oh, no. Don't look my way, Lew. Why not? You can run faster than Simon, you ought to be able to Just like you did the judge? Oh, no. No, Lew, not me either. Suit yourself. But if you don't I'll kill you right here. Don't shoot, Buchanan! D... Don't shoot! That's far enough. Now bend slow and pick up I can't, Buchanan. Lew will kill me. Do as I tell you or I will! Hold it, Buchanan. Drop that gun and stand up. Get up! You've just gone and saved us the trouble of a hanging. Lew, I can't let you do to Buchanan what you did to Simon. What are you talkin' about? - Murder. There were those on this side that saw it, Lew, they'd swear to it. Drop your gun, Lew. - My own brother? Lew... Never should have crossed Simon. I'll take those. - Not after all the trouble I've gone to. Anyway, it looks like this is your town now. You wouldn't want to There you are, Jonny. Gracias. Buchanan, when you have a Mexican as a friend, you must allow him to My horse is your horse. No, Jonny. - Please, Buchanan. This time I promise I will go straight home. Adios. - Adios. I don't think anybody'll try to stop him this time. Do you, Carbo? Under the circumstances? No. Where do you think you're going? - West Texas. Good, I'd advise you not to stay here. Like you say, this is my town now. Mr Carbo... you can have it. Don't just stand there, Amos. Get a shovel.
