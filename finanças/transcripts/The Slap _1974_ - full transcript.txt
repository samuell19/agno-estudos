THE SLAP I can't, I've got to meet Dad. - Come on! - My moped... It's only 100 yards away. So what? Nice, isn't it? Is there no light? No lift either. Low service charges. Hurry! - I need 100,000 francs. - What will you do? I said I'd have it by July 1st. Then I wrote to my mum... I think my lung's dodgy. It's got palpitations. - Is it my lung? - I doubt it, you're fine. End of the line. The keys... - So you know your medicine? - We'll find out next week! Here we go... Look! Well? What do you think? It's not exactly... You said it was a studio. But it's nice. Better than my high-rise room. I'm painting the floor white. Remy's going to help me. We'll buy mats. When people come over we'll use the bed as a sofa. I'm dead. - Why's your bike here? - My lock was stolen. Will you talk to your dad? - You like it? - Yes. - Hello, Madeleine. - Hello. - Hello, Dad. - Hello. I'm busy. I don't have a car! Your dad has classes. Getting around on a moped is easier than in a car. Let's start the tour. Well, these two rooms are... They're like in the plans. Come and see your room. We decided to put it here. It's bigger and you'll be overlooking the garden. - The park... - Of course. And you'll have your own door. - Mr Douelan? - For your private life. I must go to the office. You can reach me there. Thanks, I'll call Tuesday. - Right... OK? - Yes. I mean all this. Are you glad? - Yes. - Then say so. - I did say so. - No, you didn't! You don't look at anything, you just stand there. What it is, are you hungry? - Who taught her to smoke? - I don't know, Jean, take it easy. - What do you mean by that? - It must cost a lot. Let's say. Ten years of monthly payments, starting Tuesday. It's irresistible. Not at all. Look, it's a new house. It's great. But you're looking all tragic, as if... I look tragic? Bye, Madeleine. It's great, the sun's shining, I'm happy... See you later. She has an awful nature. - Coming, Madeleine? - Yes. STRIKE FROM 2 PM TO 2.15 PM AGAINST B. JACOME'S FIRING Aren't you overdoing it a bit? What class is Giacomet in? Final year at Lyon. What did he do? He wouldn't remove his feet from the desk. I see. Leave him alone! I'll have you... The idiot just stuck one on me! What now? Can I borrow it? I've a job in Vaucresson. Ask Remy. He has a dinner date. He'll drop you off. OK... Is there plenty of fuel? If the headlamp won't work, just thump it. What about my sneakers? I can't go home barefoot. Tomorrow will do. - You're not going out tonight? - No, why? No reason. I just wanted to know. What if I do go out? - I may get violent. - Maybe I will, then. I'll go back to Irene and we'll have fun! Idiot! Of course. He's worked here for 20 years. He's been teaching geography for 5 or 6 years now. With no problems. He's sent one policeman to hospital, another to the dentist's. Apart from that, everything's fine. What? The principal for you. Can you come and fetch me, Pierre? May I go home? Yes. For the time being. No, I'm fine. - Hello, Madeleine. - Hello, dear. - Is Dad home? - No. - That's yesterday's bread. - Doesn't matter. - Are you going out? - Yes. Where? - The Morettis. - To play cards? - What? - I love you. I love you too. What's up? Has your father spoken to you? - About what? - About us. Are you getting married? No, we're not getting married. I'm off, I said we'd be there by 8. Your dad's late... Tell him to meet me there. Unless he wants me to go alone, like last time. I'll say he's helping you revise. By the way, how's it going? The closer it gets, the less I know. Apparently it's always like that. Tell me. Love's no picnic! Where's your car? It's probably been impounded. Along with my things. The education authorities called. They're sending an inspector tomorrow. Fine. - Charvin. Do you know him? - Yeah... Let's hope this guy's up and about within a week. You'll be fined... If he's out for any longer, we're in trouble. How about dinner together? No, I'm going out with Madeleine. Goodbye, Pierre. And thanks. Sorry. I'm late, aren't I? Don't worry, I'll go on my own. I'll make an excuse. I've got the car. Anyway, I'm used to it now. Sleep well. I had things to tell you but if you'd rather play cards, I understand perfectly. That's right. I'd rather play cards. Liar! She can't have said that. I didn't even know her back then. No! No way! What? He's studying to go to Henri IV. How can he be doing medicine? Wait a sec... - Good evening. - Good evening. No way! Don't talk crap! Tell me exactly when and where she said this. The bitch! Madeleine has gone on ahead. Hurry up. Well done! I ran into her. I'm not going. Where are the kitchen matches? Here... If I pass, I'll go off with Marc and the gang this summer. Maybe Yugoslavia. Or Alsace. Bit of a difference. Do you mind dining alone? I'm going out. If I fail, I'll have to shoot myself. The idea of repeating a year... Say it again, I didn't hear a word. No, I don't hate it... but I don't love it to death either. So another year... Must go, I'm dining at Dussolier's. His parents are a pain. I can't be late. Same here. Ok. Ok, Bye, bye. That's a new record. Can I have an advance for my driving lessons? You need a licence to graduate 2nd year? - Didn't you know? - No. So we can take turns driving this summer. Keep still. - Turn your head. - Take turns at what? What's all this about Yugoslavia? - I thought it was a black mark... - Leave it. - Didn't I mention it? - No. Nothing's been decided. - Is that the time? - What do you think? Better go. I've got Madeleine's bracelet. - Where will you be? - With friends. Nobody you know. Don't worry. I do work, you know. I need to get out a bit. I won't be back late. Marc... is he the one in my class? Marc Morillon? Yes. Is he a good student? When he gets an early night. We must talk. - When? - Soon. This results in a morphostructural style, complex but unremarkable, around the Mediterranean basin. You can see the components on this diagram... Come in. Excuse me but the principal wants to see you. I think you've time for a smoke. - They know nothing about it? - Who? - About what? - Your students. About yesterday. - I don't think so. - Let's get on. Our friend is in a hurry. The police officer is out of hospital. Obviously, it's caused a stir. You're going to have to lie low. Perhaps you should request a transfer. The Ministry wouldn't object. Now wait, two guys were beating up a kid. Cops or no cops, I stepped in. Wouldn't you have? And I'm the one taking the rap? For the new term, we have 2 options^ Toulouse, or Colmar. Both junior high schools. All high school jobs are taken. Very well. You'll have my resignation in the morning. Are you mad? Mind the crossing! Resume first gear... It's not that hard. You walk in, you say, "Hi, Dad." He says, "What's up?" You say, "I'm in love with a guy." "I'm moving in with him." If he says... Turn right. Indicate... ..."Not till you're married," you say, "Don't be old-fashioned." Look out! - Are you crazy? - Shut up! Very refined. What class! You butt in on my driving lesson. You keep talking. If I hit anyone, it'll be your fault! - Release the clutch gently... Indicate... Second gear... - A quick glance in the... - Rear-view mirror. Correct. You're scared of your dad. If you don't hurry, you'll be an old maid. You tell him, then. "Hi! I want to live with Isabelle." I'm silly, but you're a man. - Isn't my dad nice? - Delightful. Where the hell's the marking! They've got too much room! Come on, Louis le Grand! Score, you useless lot! Look, Chouchou just fell over! - Hi! - I hear you're in the chair. - He got his results? - He passed. Yeah! You did it! The top schools aren't choosy nowadays! Hey, that hurt! - What about national service? - I'll be called up soon enough. - What's the score? - Nil-nil. Why's your dad playing? It's staff and students versus old boys. Someone just fouled him. He looks delighted! Well done! Come on, guys! - What? - Are you OK? Get back, what the hell are you doing? Sir... You just need to equalise. It's no big deal! - OK? - Yeah, yeah. - Do you want my soap? - No thanks. I'm sorry. - I mean I apologise, sir. - No problem. One goal each. We did pretty well. What was I going to say? Did Isabelle mention the room? What room? She wants to rent a room. To... To be independent. She's 18 now, nearly 19. She's a big girl. - It's understandable. - Got a comb? In my hip pocket with my cigarettes. I thought, "I'll have a word with her dad." You missed a bit, just here. They don't know their mind. Isabelle falls in love every five minutes. First she wants to change course, then she wants to move out... It's not just her. - Got any sisters? - No. If you had, you'd see they're all alike. They drift around. That's life nowadays. Good job we're here, eh? Me for my daughter, you for your sisters. Yeah, good job. Where will you go? How old are you, Jean? What will you do? I've my book to finish, with Pierre. We're looking for illustrations. Then there's my programs in September. I could always work in the private sector. You always register disapproval by asking my age. You and your daughter can't live off 3 programs on Napoleon. It's not just Napoleon. It's a 15-part series on the 20th century. All this for a matter of honour. Has it ever occurred to you there might be something else? - What? - This year, two or three times when I was teaching older students, I emerged an hour later telling myself I still had a lot to teach them, but I no longer knew how. What happened? An hour of my life, an hour of theirs... But it wasn't the same hour. Is that your only case? Yes. The other ones are still at my place. Who made you leave them? Nobody. But who asked me to bring them? I'll do it. I don't believe it! What's in here? A couple of spoons... a ladle, two or three ashtrays... A letter came from Australia for Isabelle. Yes, I noticed. - Do you ever discuss it with her? - About what? Helene. Did she remarry? No. We never got divorced. Oh yes... I'd forgotten. You hadn't forgotten. What're you doing here? How did you know I was here? Remy told me. I saw him after this afternoon's game. So? How come he knew where you were and I didn't? He got me the job. - What job? - Here! Your dad says you fall in love every 5 minutes. - He said that? - Yeah! And I want names! Leave me alone! Where did you get this jacket? I borrowed it. Yugoslavia's off. - So where are we going? - La Clusaz. In the Alps. It's cold. - What will we do there? - I'll tell you later. Don't sit down! - You spoke to Dad? - No, I couldn't. Why not? When he looks at me, it's like he's lifting me up. - I'll write to him. - This is pathetic! Next to him, you're a wimp. - Say that again! - Shut up! Say that again! - Get out! - Hands off! - Get out, I've had enough! - Don't manhandle me. I said get out! You broke an ashtray! I warned you, I can get violent. Now you've woken the kid up! How can you be so stupid? You've got a screw loose! This kid pisses me off. Shut up, will you? Go to sleep. Stop it! Sleep! Look at him, flapping around his crate. I'll give you such a slap! Hello. Was everything OK? Fine. Not a peep. Well, then... Got any change? - Did you break an ashtray? - Me? No. Must be the cat. Where is the cat? Will your mother be at the station? She's supposed to be. I hope you have good weather. I hope you have good weather too. Will Simon be there to meet you? No, I'll meet him at the seaside. If he still has a house there. Anyway, what do you care? A letter might come. I applied for a course in Geneva. As an interpreter? Yes, from August 10 to September 5. They said they'd call me. Well... what do I tell them? Tell them I no longer live there and give them my address. Will you explain things to Isabelle? Don't go into too much detail. There'd be no point in our writing. It's late, I'll call you in the morning. - Picasso told Cocteau... - Was that him? No! You want to hear what he told Cocteau? I'd love to. He was staggered to find he didn't melt in the bath. He swore it was a miracle. Christine read it in a Cocteau book, Opium. - Ever smoked any? - Lots. It's all I ever smoke. Did Madeleine get off OK? Yes, fine. - When will she be back? - Where are my glasses...? Aren't you going to bed? I'll sort out my books. I know we're not moving just yet. There are so many. I'm going to give some away. Did you have a good day? Wonderful. I had a splendid day. - I'm going to bed. - Goodnight. Lights out before 2 o'clock, OK? How would you react if I suddenly told you that I wanted to go and live with a boy? - Not far away. - You got a letter from Australia. From Mum. Yes, I read it. - How is she? - Fine. She's coming to Europe. This lot are crap, as you would say. I want to live with Marc. Just look at you... in white knees and socks. I can wear stockings if it helps. Society has changed, you know. People fall in and out of love. Look around you, the world's changing. What are you giving me, Isabelle? Lessons in life? I'm not giving you anything. You always complicate matters. I know what you'll say^ I'm 18, I have no job, nor does Marc... We don't know where we're going, I've got exams... And so on and so forth. Do I ever say, "And so on and so forth"? Go ahead and mock! So can I or can't I? I think you know. But why not? You asked me and I gave you an answer. If you choose to ignore me, then go anyway. You're refusing for your sake, not mine. No. Playtime is over. The answer is no. Now go to bed. I'm the queen. 2 husbands, 3 houses. Marc loves me. He's funny. My dad makes me cry. I love him. I'm fed up and I still keep a diary. I feel so stupid! I'm going to chuck it out before long. When I think of my exams, I can feel my socks slipping down my legs. There are no re-sits in September. It's a competitive exam. It lasts 3 days. An average mark won't do. You have to be one of the best. Friday 21... Christine, a friend, took us into the dissection room. I'd better think again about being a surgeon. I'll faint at my first operation. Now we'll remove the brain... Marc is getting very, very, very tiresome. Always watching me. He plans to kidnap me and hide me away at his aunt's house in La Clusaz. - I saw that guy... - What guy! Isabelle! Isabelle! Saturday 22. I got a long letter from Madeleine. Very sad and very funny. I understood. Dad said nothing. Spent the day immersed in his books. He had several phone calls. Maybe there's a woman on the scene. He's working a lot too. He told me he's quitting teaching to write books. He could do both but it's his choice. I'm not his wife. Still... there's something fishy going on. Mister Headmaster, from Louis le Grand. Sunday. It's raining and my mind's a blank. I'm meant to meet Christine but Marc's taking me to see Tosca. He loves opera. I hope it's fun. I've never been to one before. Afterwards we're seeing Remy. I like him. He's found a job till he leaves for the army. Then we'll drink punch at Marc's. He'll ask me to stay the night and I'll refuse. And we'll have an argument. I'll slam the door then cry in the street. It will be late... Aren't you asleep? Have you seen the time? Isn't your exam tomorrow? Yes. That's why I should get to bed. - You're wearing makeup. - Yes, why? - To work with Christine? - Yes. Is it forbidden? - Are they the proofs of your book? - No, just a mock-up. - Did you work well? - You're telling me! Incidentally... Christine called from out of town. Says the weather's awful. I'm fed up! I'm fed up of everything! - Who is it? - Who else? Come in. Before I forget, take this tomorrow. What is it? Are you drugging me? Vitamins. I bought some brioche too. We'll leave around 8, quarter past. Sleep well. Is the split with Madeleine final? I see she's written to you. - You can read the letter if you like. - May I? In that case, I already did. So it can happen, people splitting up without one dumping the other? It can happen, yes. - What about Mum? - What about her? Nothing. Go to sleep or you'll be brain dead tomorrow. When she left for Australia, didn't she leave me? You mustn't say that. That'd be... You were eight when you lived with her. When she left, we agreed that I'd look after you for a while. She ended up staying. When I went to Adelaide, she told me there had been another woman. She said what? That's what she told me. So it was your fault, right? She wasn't exactly very patient. Well, really! Right... Goodnight. Sleep well. Was this other woman Madeleine? - No. - Then you've had lots of women! Place your student card on the desk in front of you with your notice to attend. Your card will be collected by the supervisor, who will return it after the exam when your papers are collected. You may not leave the hall for at least 30 minutes after the distribution of the exam papers. You are not allowed access to any documents^ books, course notes, duplicates or dictionaries... Glandular exocrine epitheliums. Embryonic and maternal phenomena. - Great couscous! - I didn't make it! - Watch the time, Remy. - When's the usherette start? I'm on patrol at 8 o'clock! No, that's my third helping! Phone call for you, for God's sake! I've been yelling for ages. All that nigger music! It's for my brother's diploma. Honestly! Hello! Hello, sir... No, she's not here. We're celebrating Remy's diploma. I called this afternoon but no one answered. No, I haven't seen her. Shall I ask Marc? Is Morillon there? Put him on. What is it? Morillon? Come over for dinner. Now. It's dinner time. Yes... but the thing is... I'm supposed to go to a cocktail party... I can't hear you. What cocktail party? No time for discussion. I'm cooking dinner. Get your skates on! - Isabelle? - Yes? Don't come in yet. Wait just a moment. Miss Douelan... - So? - I didn't call you. I couldn't. Here we go. As I told Pierre, she'll come back looking all pale. She knew nothing, it was a disaster, it was Waterloo. She forgot to write her name. But she'll get good marks, like her high school finals. Yes, you will. Come on, sit down, don't move. You're my guest. Try again tomorrow. But tonight, there'll be no talk of work. - Guess what I've cooked? - You cooked dinner? I've gone to extraordinary lengths. That must be my extraordinary length. Nothing. I froze! - All the stuff I hadn't revised. - Shit! - Nearly ready. Are you sitting down? - Yes! I haven't told him. He can't talk. He was fired from school. What? - Why? - The guy said he beat up some cops in the street. There! He had a fine job. He set the time on the town's church clocks. And he repaired them. He had quite a temper on him but that was my father. With me, he was... Well, we were close. Isabelle never knew him. Eat up. You must be joking, I couldn't possibly. - Come on! - No, no, no. - Don't you like it? - Yes, it's lovely. - One spoonful. - Just a small one. Give me your plate. - Isabelle? - No thanks, honestly. I'll have to hurry you, Pierre's waiting. - How's it going? - Slowly. He types with one finger. Thank you! I can't drop you off tomorrow, I've a class at 8 o'clock. Final one of the year. I'm not going. - No exam tomorrow? - Yes, but I'm not going. There's no point. This morning, I handed in a blank paper. I can't make the coefficient now. So I'm on holiday. - What happened? - Nothing. "Structure and histophysiology of glandular epithelia." I was stuck. What would you have put? Don't speak to me like that. You jumped a red light. Didn't you see it? I'm fed up of medicine anyway. I hate it! You used to talk about a vocation... risking your life... Not any more. They'll have to be ill without me! - What do you want? - Freedom! That's not a career. But you're right. I didn't realise what I was saying. Because I'm out of sorts. Because the way you talk to me, you could be anyone. I'm not some wind-up toy with a key to make me go. I'm broken! Go to your room, wind-up toy! You don't scare me. You can beat me up but I won't sit the exam! You think you scare me? You speak badly, work badly, dance badly, you grow up badly, but you don't scare me! My life is bad! Is that's why you came home late on the eve of your exam? - To live another life? - No. Just something else! With whom? A lad who stumbles over his words, who falls over? Is that a man? I don't want a man! I don't care about men! I want a boy. One who won't be washed up at 50! Because you failed, even with all your diplomas! - Who said that? - Everyone knows! So don't make me laugh because I've had enough! Hello. Is Christine there? - No. - Didn't she sleep here? Where have you been? Nowhere. I'm leaving. I wanted to borrow some money from Christine. Come on! Isabelle! Mr Douelan... Miss Saki... A classmate... Where has she got to? - Who? - Isabelle. She slept out. Morillon... She's bound to be in touch with you. Call me the moment you hear from her. I'll be at work till 10, then at home. From now on, you alone are responsible for her. You stop her from living with me yet I have to run around after her! - In exchange I promise not to... - What? That? Oh, no, that's... I think there's one here. - My bag. Don't come aboard. - Why not? Go on. - Is this seat free? - I think so. Thank you. I'll send the money. Tell Christine I'll write. What about you? I've been called up. I leave in a week. It's moving. Get off, quick! Remy! Give this letter to Marc. I just dashed it off. - Is this it? - Yes. Rosewood Manor. - Was this impromptu or planned? - Planned. - Why didn't you phone? - I didn't have time. I'll tell you about it. This is Remy Abeille... Come into the house. What did he say? He said you only just got here. I said you'd written from Australia. Is your English no better? Sometimes. But I switch off when he talks too quickly. It's lovely! It isn't ours. Robert's lawyer lent it to us. There are only 3 bedrooms. The others are... Nothing. Well... He's the kind of man who... Switch the light on. He makes me feel life can be easy. He never raises his voice. And never lowers his tone. I understand. I mean, I feel good about myself. Maybe we'll get married. I must ask your father. We'd agreed not to get divorced. - Call him. Maybe he's home. - I just tried. I'm going to act like a trendy mother. - One bed or two? - Sorry? The young man... Remy... For the sleeping arrangements. He's my friend's brother. What do you mean? I met him on a boat. Two beds it is, then. That simplifies matters. He'll have to sleep here, Robert's sons are coming. Do you get on with them? Yes, now that Frankie's at school in Sydney. Open the window. How's Jean doing with his interpreter? Fine. What can I say? Just keep trying. I'm not Hercule Poirot! I've asked all over. I've cycled 83 km, all over Paris. You can check my meter! - Are you asleep? - Yes. Your mother's nice. How old is she? 29 and a half. Ah, ok. - She had you when she was 11? - Yes... Did you get hold of your dad? What are you doing? Caressing you. I daren't kiss you right away. - I'm working up to it. - No, go to sleep. Really... I'd rather you did. I can't sleep in that bed, it's too small. Then let's swap. Don't tell me you love me. I didn't come all this way to deny it. - For a long time? - Yes. No... I haven't been counting. England? What's she doing in England? You tell me. She hasn't said anything to me. Wait, I'll read it. The handwriting's terrible. "I'll explain later. It's raining." Who cares! "I'm sad. You can write to me if you like. "Rosewood Manor, Chilham, Kent." Didn't she say anything else? Nothing. Just that she adores me. The usual stuff. That I'm wonderful. ...I don't love you any more. We'd be happier apart... I'm done loving you. Remy called. He's with her in England. - With who? - Isabelle. - What! Hi, Mostidjian. - Hi. - Her mother's in Australia. - Apparently not. How come Remy's with her? It's disgusting! Must dash. Cheerio. Captain Barrault is delighted to welcome you aboard this Boeing 747. We shall be arriving in London in 50 minutes... Don't waste your time. There's a power cut. - Is my daughter here? - Yes. So is mine. - She could have told me. - Me too. They just turned up. - They? - I don't know what you call him. I don't call him anything. Who is he? Don't shout, I'm not used to it. - Helene... - Here, take this. - Helene, listen... - You're OK? Fine, but I get the feeling you couldn't give... I tried to call when I knew the address. - Don't you have a phone? - It's ex-directory. - What's Robert up to? - Robert... Robert? He's here. I thought he was playing tennis. Why didn't you tell me? Or write? - You might have phoned. - I tried, there was no answer. Dinner? - No... - He will. Let's go in for dinner! You know, the Food and Agriculture Organisation. F.A.O. - No. - Well, he works for them. He's doing a project for Unesco on soil resources in Australia. - Doesn't he speak any French? - Not yet. So I see. It's on the label. That's very nice of you. Thank you. And to Remy! Yes, because now it's Remy. Why do you say that? I met him on a boat. You told me, twice. Did you hurt yourself? Sorry, it was my fault.... - I'm terribly sorry. - For what? - Isabelle, fetch another glass. - Did you see that! It's from his father's cellar. - How old is his father? - He's dead. What? He can see you're no expert but he doesn't mind. He really is a nice chap. There's a bed in the library. You lend him your bathroom. No, I found a hotel at the top of the hill. I'll come for you at seven because the plane leaves at eight. Jean... There's no point in... Isabelle wants to come and live with me in Australia. But why? When? Well... now. - What for? - I can't go on like this. It's not just the work, it's everything. I know I love you but... I feel awful. It's hard to explain. Maybe I'll come back if I can't get a job over there. There are flights every day. If I hadn't come, how would I have known? I wrote to you this morning. Have you... Have you thought this through? I'll think afterwards. Good evening, then. Jean! - Sir! - Where did you spring from? - But we agreed... - What? That I'd have her back one day. Take her. No need to run. It was her idea, I could hardly refuse! She's mine too! Come back in. Marc, you're crazy! The guy's a jerk! Stop fighting! Remy, let go of him. You're being really stupid! - Let go of him! - Bastard! - Another cup of tea? - No thanks. We can't just drive round all night. - Don't you want to go in? - No. Again. - You're sick of it, right? - Well, yes. Are you so cold you need to wear an oilskin? That's how it is. Take it off. Just try! What on earth gives you the right to do that? I read it over and over again. It didn't make me cry but I thought "I can't send this" and threw it away. I didn't write a resignation letter to make you cry. I'll write another one, recorded delivery. And I'll throw it away. It has to go through me, I'm the principal. Go on, it's green. They soon gave up the idea of ostracising you. Charvin warned against making a martyr of you. You got along well with him. I don't want to see them, Pierre. I can't face it. What about the kids? It's great for kids to learn there's tungsten in Burma an hour after being oblivious to the fact. Don't try to humour me, I'm not in the mood. Right. Where shall we eat? - I reserved at Andre's. - Good. And hurry. Will you get your money back? - I'll sell. - You're speculating. That's right. I don't understand the game's subtleties. When he explains I give a knowing look. But I don't bother about who's winning. - Shall I take you to the airport? - Let's go. - Goodbye. And thank you. - Don't mention it. Will you be there by tonight? I'll leave as soon as I've dropped Isabelle off. If you miss that plane, I'll call the police. - Don't you trust me? - It isn't you I don't trust. I'll do my best. A new passport doesn't take 6 months. I have to get my school records transferred. - Do they have modern hospitals? - Fat chance! Just grass huts with men dancing around them. - Room 14, madam. - Thank you. She's left, she's OK. So am I, but I'm under observation. - So I hear. What's wrong with you? Stitches. The headlamp just... Headlamp? Close the door! They said she was out cold. I couldn't hear, we were cut off. At first she was a bit... We were afraid. Did you see the bike? Are you OK? She tried to call you after the X-ray but you'd left. Had you planned all along to go back on the bike? - Yes. - Thanks for telling me! What about her dad? I don't know. Apparently he floored a couple of nurses then he took her home. Oh, sorry! It's just that you've been with your mother for less than a week and already I'm collecting you from lost and found. What's he playing at? Try and understand that what's happening to me has nothing to do with Mum. Or with you. But living with you, I have to get up early to live. Hang on, you've lost me. As soon as anyone says anything... When I mention Australia at Mum's, you get up, put down your napkin and head for France. We're for ever. But it's over. We're happy, but this sort of happiness can't go on. I'm old now. Really? I hadn't noticed. What about your job? I won't go into that now. I'll explain when we get home. I'm sleeping at Remy's, not at home. Remy is in hospital. He'll be home tomorrow. I won't be on my own. His sister Christine is there. Bye. I'll pick up my things tomorrow. Where's my oilskin? - Which one? - The yellow one. I'll look. - Excuse me. Hello. - Hello. These universities are so slow. - I can't fill in all the forms. - Can't she do it herself? I sent her to see my friend at the passport office. I've ordered. I have to be back by 2.15. Is it Bouzy? Nice of you to remember. Let's not get nostalgic, I couldn't bear it. What's that? My hotel key. I forgot to drop it off. To your health. - When's your flight? - Tomorrow. To Australia. I don't know yet, we'll see once we're there. The 15th or 16th. - Wonderful! - More Bouzy? - Yes. - Yes. I wanted to have a word with you before leaving. Would you mind divorcing, to finish it? Finish what? Robert insists. He's so... Well, if Robert insists... It's nice to be able to talk without... - Without me pelting you with crayfish? - Yes. When two people are... Stop it, Helene. - I don't understand. - You understand perfectly. Same lunch, without the violins. Do you blame me for Isabelle? Not any more. These days, she and I... We're on different wavelengths. - Aren't you eating? - Yes. Good, aren't they? I still have that photo you took of her in Colombes. Really? She won't keep still long enough for me to take a photo. My life's hard. I live alone. - Since when? - Well, about... You know Isabelle will leave you. - So this is the right time. - For what? For your 5 minutes with her. Helene... Why did you say that? Just to be nasty? - Five minutes in 10 years? - No... That's what you meant. Dimitri lives in Aix-en-Provence. That'll cheer me up. Don't send postcards. Nothing bugs me like Australia. Let's not start that again. - We could have been happy. - Where? In the barracks? I'm an officer, with a room in town. But Snow White with her dad... Don't you start with my dad! Why did you say that? - Because I love you. - I don't want love like that! Are we first here? We're early, right? - Never mind. - Here, for when your service ends! Isabelle Douelan, Remy Abeille. No need for introductions. Leave it out, I don't know her name. - Are you well? - Yes. Were you arguing when I arrived? Not arguing, just saying goodbye. - Isn't Mr Douelan at home? - No, madam. I'm Isabelle's mother. - Will he be home for dinner? - He should be. But don't ask me when, he tells me nothing. Well... come in. Excuse me, I was just leaving. Of course. No, don't wait for me. No, I haven't become a journalist. I'd promised to try to finish and I got behind... They're waiting at the printers'. Try and drop by later. I'll tell Marthe to keep it warm. Anyway, I've got a surprise for you. No, you'll just have to come. Your threats make me laugh. I was sure he'd turn up at the last moment. Are you OK? Mind you, I don't like goodbyes either. I asked Remy not to come. - When is he leaving? - Tonight. - Destination? - London. Isabelle! Helene! What are you doing? Isabelle has gone. I just saw her. Where to? - I don't know. - What do you mean? I don't know! Get in. She's gone... Gone to find Remy, no doubt. Just in time. We were getting stupid. So where do you want to go? I don't know. I'll take the train tonight. Or a flight. I don't know, I'm starting to ramble. Take me somewhere for a drink. They'll call us if they find them. Here... Oh, my house keys! Do you want them? - OK. - No, I'll keep them. I bet she'll be back within a fortnight. Once she's had a look around Aix-en-Provence... - Goodbye, madam. - Goodbye. What time's your flight? I don't know. When I get there. - Have a good trip. - Thank you. - Mr Douelan. - Goodbye, Morillon. - He's in fine form. - It's good to see. Your call to England, madam.
