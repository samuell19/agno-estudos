Where the hell is my car? Five minutes. Five minutes? You said that 10 minutes ago. Be honest, how long? I'm guessing five minutes. Five minutes? All right, brilliant. Thank you, bye. Bye. This way, both of you. Shit. There! Sarah? Are you in here? I'm leaving. You don't have to worry about me anymore. I won't come back. Come on. Get out. Mm. Come on. Fix gearbox. Mr. Middleton? Mr. Cassidy. Oh, right. Yeah. Um, one second. Thanks. Difficult times. Difficult times ahead. Lots of pressure on young people. On everyone. And yet, you thrive. Impressive as always. I am nothing but hopeful for the trial exams coming up. I am sure everyone will do well. I'm going to hand over to Mr. Cassidy for the notices, but first I would like to welcome our new member of staff, Mr. Middleton. Sir, is Mrs. Holmes coming back? She hasn't been in. Was she in an accident, Sir? I heard she had an affair with the caretaker in the science lab. Mrs. Holmes departure was a blow. We will miss her tremendously of course. But I am sure Mr. Middleton will look after you all with equal skill and attention. Oh! Ow. Oh! I asked you a question Tiny. What are you laughin' at? Ow. What are you laughing at Tiny? I, I wasn't. Let me through. Why's he doing this? Somebody should stop him. Oh! Tony, tea? No, it's just Tony. Yeah, thanks. Is something up? I'm sure it's all in hand. You know this uh, new system, how do you know... Mr. Middleton, this isn't your, you should... your nose is bleeding. Come on, let's get you to the nurse. How did this happen? I got lost. Who's teaching that class? I can't have you bleeding all over the halls. Who knows where you've been. What? Come on. Nurse's station is just down here. Dr. Bennett will fix you up fine. Not to take anything away from nurses but I am a doctor. It's the old archaic vernacular that sort of refers to us as nurses, you know? School nurse, go and see the school nurse. All that stuff. Tell you what though, you won't find anything better than that green shit to plug your nose bleed. They've been using that stuff since the 70's. That is the pinnacle of nose bleed tech right there, boss. You got any paracetamol? Hm? Headache. Oh, yeah plenty of that. You're talking my language now. Nose bleeds and headaches are my bread and butter mate. That's what I do. I'm a bit over qualified. Um... Sorry about this. Talk amongst yourselves for a bit. Yep, I give up. Who knows how to work this thing? Um, yeah, you'll do. Ah. Thank you. Do we know who's sitting there? Glad I bumped into you Georgie. I wanted to have a chat about Friday's incident. Make sure you're okay. I can't, Sir. I'm supposed to be in English. I'm sure you can catch up. Quick talk in my office. "And Jack found that the hall" "was filled with more gold than he could ever have imagined." "He picked up some coins and stuffed them into his pack." He's bad. Jack? The bad man. Jack? Sarah, do you think this as well? Sarah, we've spoken about this. Use your words. Okay. Why is he bad? Something should happen to the bad man. Why? If you do bad things, bad things should happen to you. Like drinkin' alcohol. Or smoking. He is a little bad. Uh, stealing is wrong. Stop him. Well, it's just a story. He can't really... What did we say about this? I suppose that's the end of story time. If you behave I will finish the story. I'll work from memory I guess. Then uh, Jack remembered what his mom had told him about stealing so he just put everything back where he found it, and he began his slow and steady descent home from where he came. The end. Sarah did this? You're telling me a seven year old girl threw you to the ground... No Sir, I often throw myself to the ground to prove a point to my opponents. If I'm willing to do this to myself, right? So, you are saying Sarah threw you to the ground. I didn't say that. She started it and then some prick pushed me to the ground. I didn't see who. Ah, good. So you did fall? You tried your shtick on an easy target, simply embarrassed yourself. Circumstances spared you from otherwise unseemly behavior. Excellent. So I'm not in trouble then? Yes, yes. Um... I would like you to write down three nice things you've seen people do for each other today. Give it back to me tomorrow. Like what? Literally make it up Georgie. Your behavior will change. You seem all right. I'm gonna try not to hurt your feelings. It's not about my feelings son. It's for your own good. Off you go. It's done. He doesn't understand how it works. He doesn't understand. No. - What's this? - What the fuck's his problem? - Trouble. - Jesus. Is he just this... Please, please. He doesn't understand how things are here. Punished. Okay, thank you. On you go. Books in a pile please. Heard you go lost earlier? Thought I'd show you around? Um, yeah. Thanks. Okay uh, English here. You know that already. Uh, reprographics is down that way. You'll wanna make friends with them. You'll regret it if you don't. Uh, so you've got history, R.E., I.T.'s over there. Cafeteria is down through that way, but don't eat the food. Why not? Trust me. Uh, about that one kid's face. The big one? Literally the only kid with a bruised face. Uh, Georgie. Georgie. What's his um, what's his second name? Berzel. I'm just uh, I'm just figurin' everyone out. Helps with my memory. There, there was an incident. There was a fight, right? I mean, who was the other kid? He must be a monster to do that. There's no fights here. But there was a fight this morning. Uh, there's not usually uh, fights here. Uh... It happens, you know? Uh, I guess Georgie caught a few blows. Caught a few blows in break, right? Yeah. It's just that I saw him assembly, before the fight, before break. Um, his face? Uh, Friday. He fell. What? I know how that sounds. Really, really he did. Um, Georgie's new. All right. Like you. He doesn't know how things are here. Right. Uh, shall we? Yeah. After you. Um, science is, is, is kinda around that corner. Uh huh. - Um, um... - Shall we go this way? We'll go this way, sure. Yes. Here are some students. Anything to be concerned about? The usual stuff. I checked in with the boy from Friday. He's completely unaware of what she did. He acknowledges that he fell. I thought we were done with this. She doesn't like bullies. I know. I think betas need to accept their position. That's what causes the problem. Well, what about fairness? Don't you think people have the right to strive for more? They're not good enough to have more. If they were they wouldn't be betas. Bit late aren't we? A headache. Right. As I was saying. Okay children, line up. I know we don't enjoy this but if we don't take our medicine you'll just be like normal children. If you don't let me do this, you won't get any better. Why can't you be more like Sarah, hey? Malachai, please come on. Stop. I saw that. Do you need any help Ms. Murphy? No, Mr. Marquand thank you. Please just go about your work. You behave yourself you little shit. Hey, you shouldn't swear. Please, go. I can handle this. Fine. No, I don't like him. It doesn't matter that he likes me. Sarah, I don't like you talking to me this way. Use your words please. Oh! Oh. I, I have to go to the nurse. Sarah's in charge. Well, well, well. If it isn't the spaz-tactic four. You need to be a lot nicer to Ms. Murphy because she's bloody gorgeous. What are you staring at? You know, it's rude to stare. I said it's rude to stare! Okay. All right. Oh! Okay, off you go. Mr. Middleton? Can I borrow you for a second? Um... Thought we could catch up a bit since you're free now. Yeah. How was your first day? It was good. It was easy, really. It's not what you're used to? Of course I read your file. We don't have to discuss it here. It must have been difficult. Do you know what happened to um... Prison. Ah. You testified. I didn't have a choice. Must've been pleased. Justice. Everyone getting what they deserved. Any lasting effects on your part? Of course. Wasn't claustrophobic beforehand. And sometimes I think the thought of being trapped, stuck in a vehicle, rudderless, no help, screaming without a voice. Was there anything else? No need to worry about anything here. Certainly nothing as brutal as the last school. This isn't that kind of place you know? Students are different. - Oi! - Interesting case that boy. He's new as well. He'll come around. This place takes some getting used to. Conditioning sticks, Tony. Duty calls. - Give me your money. - I don't have any. I said give me your money. Shut up! - We don't want any trouble. - Shut up. Give me your money. I don't have any. Put your bag down. I don't wanna fight. Put your bag down! Come on. Now jump. You heard me, jump up and down. Go on, keep going. Come on. Yeah, it sounds like you have money to me mate. Go on, hand it over. Yeah, this was a test. Your friends are cowards. I'm done with this shit. Move out of my way. It's okay Sarah, he's gone now. I'm worried about you Sarah. If people find out about what you've done, what you've had the others doing, I don't think I'll be able to protect you. I know this is hard to understand, but maybe you should let some of these things go. I can't... He's new. He can be trusted. He was lost, that's all. No. No. He won't be like Mrs. Holmes. I can see that he'll understand you. Extraordinary. I'd like to have a word about your janitor. I understand. Murphy shouldn't have said anything until I... Wrong. You shoulda said something before Murphy. Now, I told you what would happen if you failed to manage the group discreetly and productively. I know, everything's entirely under control. This is a highly unique and costly experiment. One of which all of us would like kept firmly out of this very public showroom. I won't let you take them away. Let? You think about keeping these incidents to a minimum Mr. Abott. Do you have a... Come in. Oh, I'm sorry you're in the middle of something. No, no. Not at all, please. Tell me um, do you bring your own lunch, out of interest? Yeah, I do. Wise choice. I wouldn't recommend the cafeteria. You can't get everything right. You're missing a button there. Well spotted. Hopefully this tie will hide it for us, eh? Um, could you? Yeah, good. How can I help? I wanted to ask you about Georgie Berzel, and I wanted to know if you've heard anything from home. I was gettin' worried so I was actually gonna call... You can't call Georgie's home Tony. Why not? I just want to make sure everything's okay. It's complicated. I don't want you putting yourself at risk. Really? Here? Ironically, I can't do it at home. Chemistry department made this. Plenty of mints. Why would I be at risk? Because teachers who overstep their bounds can put themselves in a difficult spot. Give them an inch, they'll take a mile. For anyone to understand that it should be you. I saw some children. I mean, not one of them could've been over 10 years old and they were here on the grounds. Class eight. Exceptional class. We house them here in the dorms. We look after them, help them thrive. I'm sorry, dorms? Class eight are a series of unfortunate cases. Numerous parental issues. Um, criminality, abandonment, chemical dependency whilst pregnant. Very noble of you. One does what one can. Everyone needs all the help they can get. You don't have to worry about class eight, but our other students... 13. Severe dyslexic. Reading age of 10. 15. Young carer. Has a part time job to make ends meet. 11. Mom's new boyfriend just moved in. Not a great guy. Wander into the bookies in the next town, he's there any day of the week. They're doing fine because they get attention. The squeaky wheel gets the grease, right? Isn't Georgie one of these cases? He will be fine. You spotted an issue with the boy. You're perceptive. That's why I hired you. Trust me Tony, I know what I'm doing. I'll speak to Georgie myself. See what I can do. Don't forget your mint. Come then, in you come. Silent reading, 10 minutes. Hello Sir. I forgot my book, Sir. It's okay, it's okay. Just go and see the nurse. I don't know about this Sir. Shouldn't I just be doing lines or somethin'? Quiet Georgie. Yeah, but I could get AIDS from doing this. Go home Georgie. Yes! Oh. Sorry. How's your um, you know? Yeah, fine. - Yeah? - Thanks. It looks kinda cool you know? Like, you've been in a fight or somethin'. Not that that's cool or anything but, - you look nice. - Yeah. Um... I know. I'll see you later. Oh, come on. Yeah, it looks like they disconnected the battery. If you'd have asked I'd have told ya, it's not a great place to leave your car. It's the carpark. Where else am I meant to leave the car? You know how to fix it? No. I'm sure I can work it out. Who disconnects a battery, huh? Bored kids. It used to be a real problem. It's been fine for awhile but the last few days... Well, not as bad as before. But not great. Hey, how long have you been here? I don't know. About six years. What was it like when you got here? It was pretty crazy actually. So what changed it? Abott. His wife died, he moved here. Now he's like a dad to 400 students, and his two daughters. Okay class, injection time. Abott come in, this is Bannon. All of Class Eight are gone. Repeat, all the Class Eights are gone. The children are missing. This is Abott. Turn that damn alarm off. Sir! Sir! What are you doing here? Someone's been after me. I don't... You shouldn't be here. It's not safe. You should be at home. You stupid, stupid boy. Sarah. It's all right. It's all right. Listen to me. Listen. You, you don't have to. You don't have to. Sarah, please. Stop. Sarah? What did I do? God, stop! Stop! Please. God stop! Sarah! No! Please, stop! What have you done? What have you done? It was so funny. No. No, no, you need to see it. Calm down mate. Whatever guys. Focus please. I said focus! Stop it. Oi! Focus, guys! Oi! Oi! Any change? No. What's making them go on strike or stop or whatever this is? I'm punishing Sarah for what she did to the boy. And what's worrying you? It's affecting the rest of the school. What are you doing? Has anyone seen Georgie? I have an urgent concern about a student. Georgie. Yeah, he was absent from class today. His attendance has always been south of 73%. Yeah, but I don't have any reason to believe that he was bunking off so... And the fact he's done it before? Better decisions. Better decisions will help that boy. I'm sorry, what is going on here? Okay? He's young, he's pressured, he's gonna lash out, he's gonna get angry. He's a fucking teenager. That's not it. You're pushing him out aren't you? What? I've seen it before. You're gonna expel him. All that we needed to do was sit down, have a conversation with his family. - That's not how it is. - Put him on the right track. Special case. You can't save everyone Tony. - Oh, really? - People are people. - We do what we can, - Fantastic. - Nothing more. - I haven't heard that before. He's dead Tony! He is dead. His heart. A hereditary condition. That's bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. Calm yourself, Sir. You are a teacher and a professional. And if ever by some unlucky chance anything unpleasant should somehow happen, why, there's always Soma to give you a holiday from the facts. Hey. Shh! There's always, there's always Soma to calm your anger, to reconcile you to your, to your enemies, to make you patient and long suffering. I think it sounds like a great solution to the world's problems. Right. Reading a chunk of the book and adding a sentence on the end doesn't make much of a presentation. I'm not finished yet, Sir. What do we think of this? Stop it. What do we think of the role of Soma in this society? It makes the place better... Raise your hand if you wanna speak. It makes the place better doesn't it? Does it mean everyone could be well behaved and happy without suffering, Sir? Yeah, but don't we need a little suffering? Doesn't it have meaning? Isn't the goal to have everyone succeed, Sir? But is it real? Who can describe how this might not be considered genuine? It's an opiate for the masses. That's the argument isn't it? It means a drug that pacifies the people, keeps them quiet and stops them noticing the realities of their world. Everyone ends up better off, but there are those that will tell you that it's hollow, that it doesn't mean anything. Carry on. In the past you could always accomplish these things by making a great effort, and after years of hard moral training... Isn't Soma the best way to do that? What? You swallow two or three half gram tablets and there you are. I think you value what you work for. Okay, imagine you have two boys and one of them is given a knife. He's just given it as a gift. The other boy digs for the ore. He melts it, he hammers it, he forges it, he shapes it into a tool. It's an ugly tool. It's a misshapen tool but it is a tool nonetheless. Which one of them do you think is gonna cut himself? Go on. Finish. Anybody can be virtuous now. You can carry at least half your... Morality. Morality with you in a, in a bottle. Christianity without tears. That's what Soma is. I've been meaning to speak to you about this matter. There's been an incident at the school. I've spoken with Georgie's doctors this morning. His family has had a history of problems like this. Georgie was, difficult. He wasn't here long. But we shouldn't let his death be in vain. We can learn from this. We need to ensure we focus on the little things. Don't let anything slip through the cracks. Georgie was on a bad path. We shouldn't pretend otherwise. It may be that he was spared the worst of it. Everybody works for everybody else. No exceptions. No changing the rules. Georgie couldn't cope with this. It isn't why he died. But in his memory, it's a lesson that we should keep in our hearts and minds. Something's going on and you're gonna tell me what it is. Did I ever tell you what this place was like before I came here? Stop dodging the question. It was chaos, really. A war zone and yet... Take a walk with me. There's something I need to discuss with you. Do you know why I hired you Tony? Because I'm qualified. There's no shortage of qualified people. What's more they don't bring the baggage you have. No, I hired you because I could tell you saw the bigger picture. That there was more to what we do than just marking exercise books and giving out detention. We change lives Tony. Many, many lives. How many students have passed through your class since you started? I don't know. Hundreds, maybe thousands. Out of all of those, who do you remember the most? The ones who do best? Those I hardly remember. It's the fights I remember. Children who treat you care and help like it was cruelty. I guess you're right. But what if you could change that? Just give them a little nudge towards accepting your help? A conditioning of sorts. Conditioning? What does that even mean? I would like you to consider a more senior role. There's a colleague here, you haven't met her yet. Murphy. When you're ready, I think you could both benefit from working with our class of exceptional students. I think Georgie was an exceptional student. I don't think you ever met a truly exceptional student. Out of all those thousands, not one like our group. What about the rest? The ones like Georgie? You think I don't care? You're just like her. Who? Your predecessor. Mrs. Holmes. Focus on the students in front of you Tony. They need you. Georgie didn't deserve your help and he never wanted it. Okay class. So, we all know what we're doing today which will be finishing off your pictures. Should be fun. Where did you get those Sarah? Smoking is bad. Where did you get those? Sarah, where did you get... Mr. Berzel? It's Tony Middleton. I'm Georgie's teacher. All right, come in. Thanks for you call. That's okay. Oh uh, do you want a drink? No. No, I'm fine. They uh, they won't let me bury him. They haven't finished pokin' and proddin' him. He really did do his homework. Is that Georgie's? Oh, yeah. That's uh, that's how he came to be at your school. He was always a bit of a pain in the ass. My marriage failed. That was my fault. His mom got sick. I tried me best but I just wasn't very good. Left him to his own devices most of the time. He was independent. Independent. This is what got him expelled. He uh, stabbed some kid in the hand. I don't know why I got it for him really. Pound shop stuff. I had hoped he'd get into technical drawing or something artistic, useful. Get himself a career. There you go, you can have that. No, that's... Give it to someone more deserving. I... - Take it. - No honestly I... Take it. Take it. - Okay. - Take it. - All right. - I insist. Give it to someone who can use it. Had um, Georgie been sick before? No. I mean, he started to get these nose bleeds. Headaches, but that can't be it. That's not your heart is it? I'd hoped he'd started to turn himself around as well. He, he'd begun to... He asked me how my day was. He never asked me how my day was. Why did he do that? Heart attack. Huh? I'm so sorry. I was thinkin' out loud. I haven't really slept much. I'm so sorry. It wasn't a heart attack. His heart was crushed. Crushed. They have no idea how that happened. I'm goin' for a piss. You told me you could handle it on your own. People are dyin' daily because of you. I can manage this, I just need time! Well your staff are not my concern. Murphy was one of mine and she was pregnant so that's two deaths on your hands this time, not just the one. Yes she was pregnant and she smoked, that's the point. - Oh no fuckin' shit she smoked. - The children won't tolerate what they perceive as immoral behavior. All that's left of her is that bloody foot in a pile of ash. It'll take days to scrub her shadow off the wall. If she hadn't smoked it would've been fine. - But you keep sending me - Jesus. - These questionable agents. - That's a leg. You told me it'd be fine and you were wrong. What are you doing? Whoa! Who was that? English department. I'll deal with this. No, no, no, no, you've had your chance Abott. Show me where those little freaks are. Is there anything I can say to change your mind? Fine. Oh, I can't move. I can't move. Sir, I can't move. What are you doing? What are you doing? I can't stop it. - What are you doing? - I can't. This, this isn't me. Abott, Abott? Don't make me do this Abott. I can't, I can't... No please! Abott I'm warning you! I'm warning you, I haven't finished. Please Abott! Don't let it, no, no, no. No, no. Ah! Abott, Abott no. Abott! Please, Abott I beg of you. Please! Please I'm warning you. Abott, don't do this. No, no. Abott? Abott I'm warning you. Others will come. Let them. Others will come! It's okay. It's okay. You were wonderful. You were wonderful. Let's go see Dr. Bennett. It's all right, it's all right. Shh. It's all right. Shh, shh, shh, shh. You'll be all right. You'll be all right. It's all right. It's all right. She killed Georgie didn't she? It's okay. You'll be okay. Oh my God. She's your daughter. Both the girls are mine. This one's special. What's wrong with her? Nothing! She's perfect. But you. Because of you this is all falling apart. I'm gonna have to stop you. You can try. Oh! Oh! Shut up! Son of a bitch! You sneaky biting fuck. People are gonna figure this out, you know. I can't stop now. She changes things. Changes people for the better. If class eight can focus their abilities, think of the potential. The children, they're happy. They learn. They die. People are dying! I tried to stop the deaths. I'm thinking of the bigger picture. I'm thinking about everybody. Where do you think all the fucking nose bleeds come from? Bullshit. It's bullshit. Fine. Come on. You know what to do. The conditioning sticks, Tony. The children stay the course. But not just the children. What's happening? Good girl. Perfection. Only when compared with the mundane can one observe it. The rest settle for betas. Even epsilons are useful. Not here. We create Alphas. From the chrysalis they emerge, spread their wings, shorn of human frailty and fault, ready, able to lead, to achieve... perfection. Perfection. A new student for you today Mr. Middleton. Andrew John. Two first names for this one. Greedy. Take a seat Georgie. It's Andrew, Sir. Excellent. Keep up as best you can. A drug that pacifies the people. A drug that keeps the people pacified. It keeps them quiet and stops them from seeing the reality of their world.
