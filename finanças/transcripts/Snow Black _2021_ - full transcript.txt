Brother Camden and Sidney and Sarah have been coming to the church here for over 25 years. And yet just last week we laid to rest mother Camden and now they placed Kenya. Our hearts are heavy. There's a lot of pain and agony. Church we feel defeated. We feel like we can't accomplish the goal of survival. How do we overcome that? What can we do to save the lives that are remaining here? Anybody? Anyone? Wake up we cannot continue to die and live in despair. There's a whole community of people out there that need us.
