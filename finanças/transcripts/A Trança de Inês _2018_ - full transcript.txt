Blood pressure the same. Breathing and heartbeat the same. I'm lying on my right side, my eyes are closed, I'm not moving, but I'm not asleep, not even tired. Motionless, I am conscious of my body. My left knee weighs on my right one. Bone against bone hurts. This is how I invoke you, to empty my spirit in order to receive your imaginary presence, You would wonder if I'm saying goodbye. But no. I'll never say goodbye to you, my love... Now you can come, In?s... Now you can come, In?s. I want you to undo your braid, to spread your dark hair over my face. To massage my back with your breasts, to glide over me, to inundate me with your perfume. While my guard-nurse-executioner waits for me to fall asleep, only to wake me up again. You disappear. You don't want anyone to witness our sacred moment of love. You'll come back later, to cradle me with your nudity, with your passion, with your braid. THE DEAD QUEEN He has not arrived, mother, my dear friend, and today is past term. Oh, mother, my Moorish lover! For why hath he lied or denied, it weighs me, for he himself hath failed. Oh, mother, my Moorish lover! One of the grand poets and troubadours of his time, his excellency your grandfather King Dinis. A man of rare sensibility and sense of state. I pray that my prince would deepen his knowledge of the realm. He brought great progress and knowledge to the nation. It would be a grand lesson for when your lordship becomes king. For which motive didst my father wage war against my grandfather? It is believed that the bastard brother of his excellency your father didst conspire to take his crown, being that it belonged to your father, as the firstborn male and sole legitimate heir in the line of succession. As the law commands. But why lift his sword against his father? And not against his perjuring brother? By the grace of our Lord, His Majesty, King Afonso, the Brave, and his wife, Queen Beatriz. By your leave. Remain, Pero Coelho. What was the subject of your lesson? About the poetry of his excellency, your father King Dinis, and his passion for literature. My father... intended to pass the crown to my bastard brother, whose ideas he clouded and sentiments falsified. All because he appreciated the company of my brother more than mine. Would I dare permit our beloved nation to be governed by a bastard? A king shows his bravery whilst prince, defending above all, nation and honour, in God's name. You have come of age, and now is the time to serve the kingdom and honour your most noble destiny which God granted us. You will wed a woman of noble birth from the neighbouring kingdom, in order to seal a long lasting peace between us. - Wed, sire? - By my will. Tis done. Soon you shall receive Constanza in your care. Surprise! Happy Birthday, baby. Hey, we're not at school anymore. Take it easy, Casanova. Happy Birthday, moron. Happy Birthday to you... Happy Birthday, son. Happy Birthday, boy. Happy Birthday, dear son-in-law. - Happy Birthday, Pedro. - Thank you. Happy Birthday, son. How are things at the studio? Are you still filling our country with shopping malls? Yes. You're missed. Well, those stupid jokes you make that only I laugh at are missed. - It's heavy, huh? - No. It's all the same. Working more, earning the same... You were smart to leave when you did. And how's your new life in Daddy's studio? Heavy stuff? - Heavy like this? - Easy now... Somebody hold me! Hold me! I bet you didn't see this coming. I had my suspicions. How? I told everybody to park in the back. That's impossible. It was a nice party. Thank you for coming. - Do you want me to walk you out? - Don't bother. It's good to have you back. Wait a minute, who's driving? - Shall I get you a taxi? - Yes, it's better to call a taxi. No? See you tomorrow at the studio. See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - See you. - Do we need to get a room for those two? - I already offered but they refused. What about us? Come on. I have a gift for you. Goodbye, good man. Safe journey back to the earth. Goodbye, my friend. It's the right decision. You are very brave. Goodbye, partner... You'll be forever in my heart. - Daddy... - My sweet daughter... We are one... everything unites us... nothing can separate us. Nothing. I love you. Let's get on with it. Let's go. A noble savage, strong and brave, true and just, always worried about others, capable of great sacrifice for our community. We are all headed for the same fate. From dust we come and to dust we shall return. Only death returns balance. completing the cycle of life. Pedro and Constanza. Come here, my dears. The end is also a new beginning. One story ends and another begins. You are exemplary members of our community, hardworking, dedicated to the cause, perfectionists in the execution of your tasks, followers and guardians of our rules. With the departure of our brother, comes the moment for renovation. It is the understanding of our elders that you must shoulder this task. Remember, look into each other's eyes and take just one sip, careful to place the glasses back at the same time. The first to place their glass on the tray will be the first to die. Our survival depends on our spirits being aligned with one another. This moment is yours, a secret that belongs only to you. You may drink. As you can see in the render, the building brings a new harmony to the public space. As you can see in what? What the hell is a "render"? Dad, a render is the... This is way off scale with the context! Where is that sketch I did of the lobby? The client wants visibility for the main volume. It's what they told us at the last revision of the project. Visibility... Why? Is this a shopping mall? Somebody give me a pencil. - No one has a pencil? - Let's take it easy. The idea is to have a more appealing building. These guys want fireworks? We give them fireworks. It's designed to sell, Afonso. I couldn't care less what those sons of bitches want. My client is the city. The relationship between the lobby and the exterior is fundamental. Get it? Permeability... with the surrounding area. - Have you heard of it? - Yes. If only someone had looked at my sketch! Everybody saw your sketch. Seriously, Afonso, this proposal came from the meeting with the client. We need this. We can't afford the luxury of losing another contract. The library died, the pools are at a standstill... Then you sign it. I won't put my name on this rubbish. King Pedro! It's always the same story with you, King Pedro. You can't keep the doctor waiting. Good afternoon, Pedro. This moron always asks me the same questions. Were you raped by your father? Abandoned by your mother? Do you feel guilty about the death of a friend? No, no, no. He's at a dead end. He can't prove anything, he can't cure anyone. Shall we continue where we left off in our last session? It's important that we talk about your relationship with your parents. I don't feel anything. I killed them all. In my heart, in my thoughts and my memory. Because my heart, memory and thoughts are busy with other things. I'm cold. I want a straitjacket. This quack doesn't get anything. He doesn't know who I am. I don't want to answer. I don't want to be cured. I only want your green eyes, honey, olive, transparent, the holders of all secrets, of all spells, of all passion... So let's talk about In?s. Why do you still feel responsible for her death? Let his royal highness, the crown prince, Pedro, receive his spouse, Constanza Manuel of Villena. Let's hope this one can get pregnant. And not die before giving birth. I come to serve you, my Lord. I bid thee welcome, in the King's name. Who could have imagined that this image of serenity and peace, would trigger an eternal spiral into the winds of tragedy, of madness, of love and death? You were the truest of damsels. You raised your eyes to me, so confused, you rose and curtseyed so quickly and childlike. Can we start the interviews? What interviews? Your father asked you to interview candidates for the museum project, remember? Can't we schedule that for another day? The first candidate has arrived. Send her in. May I? In?s de Castro. With subtle differences It was a day like any other, until you tapped lightly on my door and inundated my office with the clear water of your eyes and saved my life with the magic of your smile and lit up my world with the bronze of your hair. I remember this moment blurred with another. On a winter morning, lulled by the slowness of the falling rain. You arrived stumbling, torn, filthy, lost in the forest for days, weeks maybe. A fugitive from misery, from chaos, from the noise of the city... There's somebody there! Somebody help! You were lost and I found you again, In?s. Light and sweet and floating, under my gaze, never more to come out from under it. The drug they put in my veins envelops me in its tentacles. It takes me from the streets of eternity, from before, to after, to now, past and future, where I'll forever find you, love you, worship you and go mad. Long live the king! To the kingdom! Wouldst thou honour me with a dance, noble damsel? A request from the prince is a sovereign command. Music! What do you wish, my Lord? Simply to dance with the most beauteous of damsels. For what reason do you place me before the eye of the people? Tis impossible not to gaze at such beauty. As the friar doth say: "The counsel of wine is a false path." Resume the festivities! Sorry, I fell asleep. I need coffee. Why did you choose to work in this studio? These days there isn't really much of a choice. I saw the ad and applied. After all... who doesn't want to work for the great Afonso Bravo? Me... I'm just overreacting... I didn't have much of a choice either. The firm I was with was losing clients, my father wanted to shake things up a bit, he invited me, insisted and I came to work for him. It seemed like a natural choice. And it's not anymore? It is. It is... I want to congratulate you on your work. It was a surprise. Surprise? Well, you didn't have a lot of experience. I didn't. So why did you give me the job? I don't know. It's late. I'm going to ask my mother for help. Don't do that. She's already asking questions. What questions? If everything's all right, why I'm not pregnant yet. What do you want her to do about it? She said there's a tea that could help. A tea that makes you want to. I don't want to either. It's like we're brother and sister. My mother said it's normal in the beginning. But even Joana got pregnant. I don't want to go back to the dormitory. I don't want to... I look within myself and find the reason for my condition. It's just that all the energy I have left is to work on my love, and I panic at the thought that every night we don't spend together, are days, hours, minutes, of your company that I waste, forever. And there I was, a young prince, mad for the only woman in my life, surrounded by obstacles and reasons of state, and risking hellfire to reap one little kiss from her. If I were just a simple villager, you, In?s, would be my future companion, and nothing would trouble our love. If I could have chosen my destiny, I would never have chosen power or fortune. I would rather choose poverty, anonymity, routine, ignorance, to accept life without thinking and accept it the way it is. It's no use explaining it to them. They like putting us in our boxes and case closed. Anyway, none of us will ever be cured, none of us will ever get out of here. We suffer from the evil of living. We are ill-adapted for life as they understand it. They, the healthy ones, who eat one another, who kill one another, who destroy one another, cannot enter our private world. They put me away in here, and I put them away out there. The chaos in my head is what makes me mix up time, with time, with time. I travel between being and not being, existing and not existing, and this leaves me tired, confused, unsure. I have neither past nor future I only have present, present and present. And I believe this is my illness. It's as if everything is happening now and it's all jumbled up inside of me, and I can only distinguish parallel moments because they happen at different speeds. During childhood, time stands still, In adolescence, time takes forever, as an adult, time races, and in old age, it vanishes. If there is life after life, will there be death after death? If with death a life is born, will that life have an end? And will we die again? And so on... again and again and again... Until when? Is there a place for peace, freedom, salvation? Where pain and loss and rage and despair no longer fit? Or does this place only exist in our most intimate desires? And this is the utopia that we live for, and fight for, and die for, and are reborn century after century for all eternity? Now I spend my time imagining you, sleeping in your dreams, feeling my heart beat with yours, deliberately letting the venom of passion run through my veins. How will I go on without your legs wrapped around mine, without your hands caressing this pain, without your eyes lighting my way. At least you visit me every morning, In?s. You, with your beauty and cosmic sweetness. You, who walks barefoot in the twilight of my room. You, who lies in my bed and holds me and kisses my mouth. Thank you, Olga. As always, it was wonderful. My little Pedro must come more often. We don't see you anymore. It's my father's fault, he keeps me busy. Poor boy... not even time to come have lunch with his mum. I've heard you've been misbehaving. You heard wrong. I've been more than behaving myself. So, what's this? Did it just slip off and fall down the sink? A wedding ring doesn't mean anything. How about that In?s that showed up at the studio? They say she's beautiful. She is. She's beautiful. Seems like she's been throwing herself at you! That's ridiculous. Who put that nonsense in your head? I want to know if you're with her. What is "with her"? Please, Pedro, don't make me explain. What is "with her"? Sleep with her, take care of her, run away with her... What is "with her"? With her! Or are you going to tell me you don't know what I mean? I can't believe we're having this conversation. Your father mustn't find out about these things. It's Pero Coelho, isn't it? He's the one putting these ideas in your head. I see the way he treats In?s. He's probably jealous. Jealous of who? Of Dad, who also likes her. Him and his need for affirmation. Always in Dad's shadow. Or maybe you're jealous? Don't be ridiculous, Pedro. You don't know what you're talking about. Are you blind? Out of your mind. bewitched by this girl? You have no idea what you're dealing with. - Is that a threat? - No, Pedro. The threat is your little affair. Listen to me, my love, This story won't have a happy ending. Stop while there's still time. I really don't understand what the fuss is all about. I thought you'd be better prepared for dealing with extramarital affairs. I will not allow it! I guess not. 3, 2, 1... Off we go! Go on. Go help make the soup. I'll be there in a minute. Afonso? Afonso! - Come and help me with the water. - I completely forgot. I forgot. I'm sorry. My lord! My lord! Unloose thy tongue. They have taken In?s. What do you say? Guards arrived at sunrise and removed her elsewhere. Challenge not the temper of the future king. On whose command? By command of your father, King Afonso. They were the royal guard. - To where? - To Albuquerque, my lord. You shall ride with me, to the aid of In?s. My lord... Forgive my boldness, but the command was given, you must not look for Lady In?s until the King consents to it. I beg of you, my lord. For the sake of Lady In?s, my lord. I was so wrapped up in our happiness, In our love that seemed eternal, that I listened neither to rumours, or advice or warnings, I let them take you. And now, far away from your lips and powerless to rescue you, I struggle my days away, unable to touch your hair, to smell your perfume, to be inebriated by your spell. Did you not swear to me In?s, that nothing could keep us apart? How could my father's henchmen believe, that they could break this love without boundaries, without time, without space, materialised wherever and whenever in history, in eternity. Are you still awake? Yes. I can't sleep. Lots of work at the studio? Crazy. I'm going to sleep now. - Do you want a massage? - Don't worry about it. I'm exhausted. What are you doing? You're so full of yourself, you didn't even change your pin number. - Is this really necessary? - You tell me, Pedro. Did it have to come this far? I've been waiting a long time for you to talk to me. Or do you think I'm stupid? - What, you're going to hit me now? - Don't be ridiculous. Calm down! Calm down. Tomorrow we'll talk it over. I've rented an apartment! I've rented an apartment. Ok, that's it. I want to be closer to work, I can't take the commute anymore. Who's that In?s? Get out, Pedro. Get out of here. Out! Get out. Leave. - Leave! - Stop it. Stop. Go or I'll say you hit me. Estevao and Sancha. The first to place their glass on the tray will be the first to die. Our survival depends on our spirits being aligned with one another. This moment is yours, a secret that belongs only to you. You may drink. It's not fair! They didn't choose one another. It's ok, Pedro. What do you mean, son? Why can't we choose our own partner? We are thinking of the future generations. - Can't you understand that? - You chose Mum and she chose you. So why is it different for us? One has nothing to do with the other. Those were different times. It was that chaos that almost killed us all. Humanity is a plague. Let the good remain. And only a few. I'm in love, Dad. I'm unhappy like this. I ask the elders' permission to annul my marriage to Constanza... and to allow me to marry In?s. Stop this madness, Pedro. Now is not the time for one of your rants. Leave him. Leave him! What's the point in forcing him if he can't even procreate? All you think of is yourself. You don't even try to make things work. Look at yourself. Take a good look at yourself. Curled up on the ground. It couldn't be more obvious. Is it with this that you want me to have the only child I'm entitled to? Does that sound fair to you? I ask that my marriage to Pedro be undone, and a capable mate be assigned to me. Is anybody opposed? The council concedes... the annulment of the marriage between Pedro Rey and Constanza Manuel. With suspension of reproduction rights between Pedro Rey and In?s de Castro. Good morning. - Good morning, young architects. - Good morning. Did you have a nice evening of work? Is it done? "33 PARADISE STREET" What are you doing? Has something happened? What's happened? You're hurting me. Why are you leaving? Did you see the name of the street? Isn't it funny? Talk to me. Please tell me what I did wrong. I'm sorry. Hello, Pedro. I killed them all, In my heart, In my thoughts and in my memory. How have you been feeling? Your mother sent these chocolates you like. I spoke to the doctor. He told me you're doing much better. You'll be getting out of here any day now. Who are you? Come on, son... I don't know you, but thank you for the chocolates. They're my favourites. I'm human, Pedro. I made a lot of mistakes. I make mistakes. But I never wanted to hurt anyone. I wish everything could have gone differently... I'd go back if I could, but I can't. What if you could travel through time? What would you do? I wouldn't have cheated on your mother the times I did. I would have respected your decisions more. But we can't travel through time... can we? I'm dying, Pedro. We're all dying. I have cancer, I don't have much time left. I wanted at least, with my only son... I wanted us to be ok. I don't have any family. They're all dead. One by one. I love you so much, Pedro. After war and peace, I am in the absolute desert. I have spent my hate, I am home, I have found myself in loneliness. And just like everything in my existence, immense and impassioned, only a tragedy could restore our love, taking one life away only to bring another one back. Poor Constanza... a woman handed over, transacted, unwanted mother and wife. Alone, she gave birth and died. as if by divine command, mission accomplished, of no further use. A child is born, a prince, he killed his mother and survived. Why is there no hunger that does not bring excess, death that does not bring a new beginning, life that does not call death? In my mourning attire and with the knot of your absence in my throat, I dream of our reunion, I'm thankful for this love which makes me overflow, I imagine you back in my bed, I remember the day I first saw you, and lost command of my heart. And now, torn by emotion, I see you for the first time in months, eye to eye, reunited, we are one, endless, and eternal. With my kisses I swear that we shall be King and Queen, lover and concubine, husband and wife, united through passion, despair, madness, through carnal desire. Hello? Don't ever let me go for so long without hearing from you. I beg you. What now? We can't pretend that everything is like it was, because it's not. I'm pregnant. Your blessing, Your Highness. By your leave. What is the reason for your presence? I bring news from the court and from your father, King Afonso, sire. Thy father hath called a council of state to discuss your liaison with Lady In?s. I am the crown prince, the council of state doth not concern me as yet. True, sire, but... the subject there treated is of your concern, His Majesty, the King, fears the succession to the crown is in danger. Your royal seed hath been planted in Lady In?s. Assure His Majesty that the rightful heir to the throne is Fernando, the fruit of my marriage to the lady Constanza, as my father willed it and as I do. Your father offers you the finest of noblewomen in the kingdom to wed, but you have refused. I yet mourn greatly the loss of my wife. It weighs heavily on my heart. His Majesty hath revealed he is disposed to consent to matrimony between Your Highness and Lady In?s... If that be your will. Let His Majesty worry no more for the future of a nation that captivates me. His son, Crown Prince Pedro and future king, will never marry Lady In?s. By your leave, sire, I leave to convey this message to your father, who will most certainly be surprised. There is no secret, no estrangement, no reason of state that will keep you from me. I see you smiling with a drowning heart, a cry that hath haunted us since the beginning of our dream, foreseeing the end of the world. The cretins, the vultures, the damned and infamous. Always with their conspiracies, their collusions and attempts, They do not understand our outrage. They've never loved. They are heartless. And confusingly I realised the reason for my misfortune, the reason for this torture of living In your absence. I'm forbidden to love you because I love you, I can't possess you because I want to possess you, I can't be yours because I am yours. I ask myself what I am doing here so far away from your braid. I'm the only one left. Who am I and what am I doing here, I ask myself again. Every day I feel more apathetic, deafer, more impenetrable. Have a nice day, sleepyhead. Don't start, I'm already late. - Good morning. - Good morning. - I love you. - I love you too. I want to see all of this love after the he's born, with all those nappies to change. Aren't you going to work today? If I feel like it. I'm a liberal professional. Very nice, you lucky boy. I have to go. Kisses. - Have a nice day. - You too. You always forget... Hello, Pedro. Aren't you going to invite me into your new home? You've always had good taste. I'll just get right to it. I want to get a divorce as soon as possible. Since when have you been in such a hurry to do this? Since I figured out you're not coming back. You know that's what I've always wanted. I didn't want to pressure you. It's the right thing to do. Would you like some coffee? Or tea, if you prefer. I never cheated on you, Pedro. I never cheated on you. Not in our first months... Not even when you went to Italy that year. I was always faithful to you. I never cheated on you either. Not even when I went to Italy. I was always by your side. Whenever we ran out of money, I found a way for you not to have to ask your father. I was always by your side. Please don't start with that stuff. While we were together, we were together. I lost the baby, Pedro. I didn't know... I lost the baby and you weren't there. I'm sorry. How can you tell me now that you're never coming back? In?s is the love of my life. I can't be away from her for a minute without getting all choked up. I'm sorry. My lawyer will send you the papers. - I think I need more eggs. - I'll go get some more. - Will you? - I will. Thanks. "In?s: Field" Finally! Congratulations on the baby. Pedro invited me for the celebration. I hope you don't mind. My Lord! My Lord! As if the hand that took your life now holds my throat and stops my tongue. I wanted to call down a plague of death on those heartless executioners, but all I could put forth was a hoarse, mute cry, a mad howl, the yelp of a miserable animal with its throat cut. I could have sworn I would vomit my own heart. I think I must have ended up vomiting it, for I no longer possess it. I swore with my hands drowning in your blood, that my soul would not know rest, until your torturers met their ends in the cruellest fashion, till I ripped their carcasses apart, and ate their bestial hearts incapable of feeling mercy. I have a terrible fear that the death of the body solves nothing. That everything continues in that part of us called a soul that it is said never dies. Now, I'd have to call the police. And they would put your naked body on an ice-cold table, autopsy you, dissect you. Don't let them, I seemed to hear you beg. So I decided to keep you with me, to take care of you, so that no one could harm you. I understand Pedro. You're very charming. No wonder he lost his head. You know, In?s, Pedro and I never had sex. He never desired me, and to be truthful, I never desired him either. There would have been nothing wrong with it if you had. It was your time. You don't get it! We grew up together. We all feel like brothers and sisters. Of course that's not your case. I can see your effort, trying to belong, to be a sister like the rest of us. Sometimes I ask myself how you still keep going, why you haven't left yet. You must have strong reasons. I swear, I didn't want to destroy your marriage. Forgive me for that. It was all so fast, and we lost control. I hope that true love, one day, may also cross your path. Truly. No! I knew it! She's pregnant. How could you? She's dead, grab her! She's pregnant! Leave it. Might as well pull the weeds out by their roots. Grab her! Murderer! Please. Do what has to be done. What eternity would be mine, if I continued to live these three lives? Who knows if after death I won't remember thirty more, who knows if I'll live three more, and on and on through the centuries and centuries and centuries. He's dead. And from the outside I can see my misery, the condition your enemies have brought me to. I know that I still have a choice to overcome. One of the most terrible. The one that brought me here. Your father has died. I asked so little of life, but It bestowed on me two great honours: To be king and to be your slave. And now, as all that I must undertake is immense, I am presented with this nameless pain which I cannot bear alone. Come help me, In?s. While my people deliriously cheer me, I feel emptier than ever. The power bestowed upon me with the vinegary taste of solitude. Traitor. Perjurer. Butcher of men. I want names. In justice, one must address the court in its entirety. It was us... It was us, together with Diogo Lopes Pacheco. I want all the names! Ordered by His Majesty. your father King Afonso. I shall rip out your heart with mine own hands. You shall find it mightier than a bull, and more loyal than a horse. Through the back. Why do you wait? I let them kill you. That was the main reason for my fury. When a man blames himself, he will do anything to calm his conscience, to convince himself that the guilt he feels day after day, night after night, does not exist In his own heart. I know that because of these things they called me mad and cruel, I see those horribly mutilated corpses burnt, but in the end find no comfort. And I thought: I'm more alone than ever before, more lost, I am a pathetic king, and I realize the pettiness of my vengeance compared to my immense pain. My lord. Please, sire, listen. Sire! Please, my lord. My lord... Tis sacrilege, my lord. Tis sacrilege. Where is she? This king... ... will not die before exacting vengeance for Lady In?s and making her my queen. She can't breathe. Wouldst thou do me the honour, your excellency? - Thou art beautiful, o my love... - Read loudly! So that the people may understand the meaning clearly. as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. Who is she that cometh with the dawn, fair as the moon, bright as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? Why hast thou stopped?! Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm, for love is strong as death, jealousy is cruel as the grave, the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame. Many waters cannot quench this love, neither can the floods drown it. Let it be known that Lady In?s and I were wed in a discreet ceremony, before her life was cowardly taken. Witnessed by mine loyal squire Estevao, and his lordship the bishop of the court, who sanctified our matrimony. And so it was done, Your Majesty. Beatriz, kiss the hand of the queen thy mother! Estevao. Now you. Everyone. Tis thy duty to honour thy queen! Now, it seems, my family informed of my irreversible health condition, pays for a room in a clinic fit for a king. One of those places where they abandon wandering minds, and out of control, wiping forever from the face of the earth stories like mine, lest they set an example to other souls moved by passion. Imprisoned in this new life between lunatic and criminal, I realised that my mind could not withstand the effort, and I let myself go. And I agreed with the people who called me mad, with the psychiatrist who said I should be kept away from a civilised society, with the judges that threw me in here. All that is left for me is you. All that is left for me is to love you. To remember when you said, there will come a night, where we will be one. And we were. As at the beginning of the world, we were. Like everyone and everything. We were. Everyone and everything. Arms. Legs. Tentacles. Branches. Vines. Roots. Avalanche. Wind. Lightning. Plants and animals. Fish and birds. Fibres and velvet. Gods. Empress and valet. King and concubine. Lady and prostitute. Woman and man. Pedro and In?s. And I, Pedro, wait for you here, next to my vision of madness. And in the twilight hour, when you see me asleep, suffocate me, kill me and save me.
