We get the wheels, we get la feria, we keep moving on. No messing around. You mess those wheels up this time, Chong, I'm gonna have your ass. Move! Right there, homes. There's nobody, homes. Where's your party, boy? Turn down the radio. You inviting the cops too or what? I want El cromo. Gonna get some green for this shit right here, homes. Fuck. Hey guys? Those are chrome-plated lugs. You're gonna strip them. Look at this guy? The plating flakes off. Yeah? This is a lease. No one's gonna pay to ride... Shit. Come on, man. Hey guys. Guys. What the fuck? Guys seriously, you don't wanna do this. Take him out. Fuck him up! No! Not the car! Get that puto! Fuck him up, man! Fuck him up! Get him! Hit that fool! Motherfucker! Shit. Fuck. Everyone's asleep, Burt. Sleepwalking. Between the ice caps, the pornographers, poisoned water, mutants... it's all connected. Hey, Clyde. It's 2029. Why are we still talking about mutants? Hey, it's me. I'm in the car. Yeah, it was a good trip. Killed it up and down the fence. Wolverine. I knew it was you. Oh, fuck. Please! I'm in trouble! You're the only one that could help! Get the fuck away from me! Please! Logan! Who was that? I don't know, some crazy lady. Don't worry. As I live and breathe, the Wolverine. And he's a junkie now. Who the fuck are you? You know, you got some buckshot in your door. I heard you was in Phoenix. But then last night, some friends of mine in Texas HP called and told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout on 54. Not unusual, I know. Except one was missing a hand, another one a leg. So they was thinking, it was either an escaped tiger or Freddy Krueger. But neither one of them can drive, one being fictional, the other one extinct. And since the wheel lugs they found belonged to a '24 Chrysler, and well, this is a '24 Chrysler. She found you yet? Gabriela? See, I'm not looking for you, Wolvie. Well, not really. I'm looking for someone, who's looking for you. She took something of mine when I wasn't looking. Something for which I am responsible. Mexican lady. Has her sights on you now. Doesn't ring any bells? I don't know any Gabriela, so get the fuck out of my car. You know... I know what you're hiding, amigo. The old cue ball south of the border. What do you want? A little co-operation. I'm a fan, by the way. Fuck, fuck! No, Mr. Esperanza, no. I know I said June, but I need the boat now. Why would that mean the price go up? Listen to me. I know you wanted 70. Ok, what if I could put together $45,000 cash right now? Hello? Hello? Shit. Hey, Sam. Morning. He's having a bad day. They're all bad days. He needed these six hours ago. This is not enough, you know. Won't see us through the week. I'm working on it. Your turn. I've had a rough night. Poor you. In other news, he told me last night he's communicating with someone. He's not talking to anybody. Don't be so sure. He's got all these details. I thought that tank was supposed to act as a barrier. It's got them cracks in it. Just please stop. Bottom left. You're not listening. He's been asking questions again, about why we're here. I think he's trying to read my mind. That's what these are for. Eating his curds and whey. Then came a big spider. Which sat down beside her. Miss Muffet... Friends, I have good news for you today! It's not about what you do. It's not about your deeds. You can't live up to God's rules. He knows that you can't. It's Ok, we're imperfect. Make way, sir. I said make way! The new Quesalupa from Taco Bell! Get it with chicken! Get it with steak! And with the cheese baked right in the shell, it's the next big thing! Go now while supplies last. Who are you? You know who I am. You're the man who puts me to sleep. We both could use some sleep. No! No! What are you doing to me? Charles. Come on, now. How long have I been here? What are these? You remember what they are. The shots mellow the seizures. The pills keep them from happening. How about you blow on them to make them safe? Fuck off, Logan. So you remember who I am now. I always know who you are. It's just sometimes I don't recognize you. Take the pills. You leave me alone with that fucking albino. He doesn't listen to me. I know a damn speciation when I see one. A what? Speciation. New mutant, a young one. There are forces trying to kill them. Forces? They want help. Forces, forces. It's too bad you're not in that business anymore. They don't want me, they want you. Oh yes, that's how fucking stupid they are. They're waiting for you at the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago Charles, a long time. There are no new mutants. Understand? Hasn't been a new one born in 25 years. Not anywhere. You always thought... we were part of God's plan. But maybe... Maybe we were God's mistake. What a disappointment you are. When I found you, you were pursuing a career as a cage fighter. A warm capper to a life as an assassin. Hooked on barbiturates. You were an animal. But we took you in. I gave you a family. And they're gone now. Logan. Logan. What did you do? What did you do? Answer me! Why are we here? No one should live like this. Drugged in a fucking tank! It's for your own good. No. No, it's not! You're waiting for me to die. I don't wanna fight, but there's things we need to discuss. What things? Well, would it be considered nagging, if I was to repeat my previous observation, that the dose is too low to suppress the seizures? It's what the guy gave me. Wasn't in a position to make demands. I almost died this morning. That seizure was... It was barely a minute. It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. You're less affected. You know he needs a higher dose. And I know you got more money squirreled away. That money's to get us out of here. No, not us. You and him. You're saving to buy a Sunseeker. Sun is the keyword. I hardly see myself, cowering below decks like Nosferatu. Do you? Folding your underpants, and making him spotted dick. Found this in your pocket. Adamantium. If you are planning to blow your brains out, could you wait till you're out on the high seas? I just mopped these floors. I don't need this shit. A year ago, you asked me to help you. And God knows I've tried. But I can't help you Logan, not really... if you're not going to talk to me. I hear you at night. You're not sleeping. You don't wanna talk about that. Or the booze you're drinking. Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles. Or the blood I wash from your clothes. Or the fresh wounds in your chest. The ones that aren't healing. And I'm pretty sure you don't wanna talk about the fact that you can't read the label on that bottle. It says, Ibuprofen. That was my favorite mug. Stay out of my shit. Something's happening to you Logan. On the inside you're sick. I can smell it. Best night ever! Hey, driver. I love you. I love you. You're such a doll. Mr. Logan. Oh, Jesus. Please. We need a ride. Not available. Call a cab. My name is Gabriela Lopez. I don't wanna know your name, lady. There are men after us. We need to get out of here. Go north, cross to Canada. Anyone can do that job. I'll give you $50,000. How did you find me? 'Cause you are fucking up my life, lady! The people after you, they're on my ass now! Sightings were posted. Laura, go inside. What? What sightings? People said someone who looked like the Wolverine was in El Paso, driving. Said he looked old. Hey! I told you to stop it with that ball! No, please. Bad girl! I told you, bad girl! No. no. No, please. No. Stop. Stop, please. No. Mamacita's gonna have to pay for that. Shit! They're gonna have to pay for damages. And she has cash. I've seen it. You should get your fat ass back in your office. You'll get your money. Don't let her call anyone, please. They will find us. They will kill us. I am a nurse. Was. In Mexico City. When did that happen? This morning. Near the border. I got away from them, but... now they know my car. Look, I gotta go. No, wait. Wait please. Here. Here. Please, wait! Look. Look. Here. Take this. It's $20,000. Here. Take us to this address. You can have $30,000 more when we get there. My friends there will give it to you. They will be waiting. They will give you anything. Where did you get this? My boyfriend. He wants to kill me and take her. And that's your daughter? Yes. I know you're still good inside. I know you want to help us. You don't know anything about me. Please! I promise, there will be no problems if we leave now. I can't just leave to North Dakota! We have to be there Friday. Or what? Or we miss our chance to cross. Please. You have to. Please. Please. I like those. They make you look younger. Charles listen, I gotta go away. For a few days, ok? I got a long ride for some good money, but when I get back, we're gonna get outta here. We're gonna drive down to Yelapa. We're gonna get ourselves a boat. And we're gonna go live on the ocean. Will you be safe there? Yeah. Yeah, we'll be safe. Look what Logan got us, Charles. Be back in a few days. Shit. Logan. Yeah? What happened? Did something go wrong? The job was wrong to begin with. Logan! Logan! What? Who does this belong to? Who's that? Thought you were supposed to see shit coming. I can track mutants. I'm a glorified truffle pig, not a clairvoyant. Go inside and keep Charles quiet. Go inside now! You need to turn around, asshole. This is private property. Yes, it is. In fact, I believe it belongs to a multinational smelting company based in Shanghai. Where are you keeping the old man? Is he over there? Or is he there? That'd be smart. I'd like to meet him. I'm told the HSA classifies his brain as a weapon of mass destruction now. Damn shame, what happened back east. He's been dead for a year. I need the girl. What girl? The one that goes along with that ball you're holding. There's no girl here. I know you went to the motel. Yeah, I was called there. There was no girl. It was just the woman. Just the woman. Such as she was. So... You saw Gabriela. But, you didn't call me. That hurts. You didn't shoot the poor thing, did you? No, did you? I asked you first. I don't like guns. Of course. I wish you'd called me, Logan. Like I asked. See? You're not the only one that's been enhanced. Logan. Logan! This is Laura. Caliban, come! This is who I've been telling you about. This is Laura. We've been waiting for you. Come, come here. It's ok. Come. Laura. It's ok. It's ok. Come. Come. Come. It's ok. You can stay here, Laura. It's safe. We can look after you here. Come on. Looks like ex-military. Bounty hunter, maybe? Worse. Is he by himself? Yeah, not for long. You get him back in his ride, take him out to the wash and dump him. What if he wakes up before I get there? Text me where you are. We'll pick you up. Yes. Logan. Hey. Logan. Hey! Hey! You'll get it back after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into. No, Logan. What? I don't. I think... Logan the woman that you met, that's not her mother. So she talks? We're communicating. Communicating. Take these now. We have to get out of here. It's not safe here anymore. And you can't have an attack out there, you understand? Yes, but this is the mutant that I told you about. She needs our help. She's not a mutant. Yes, she is! What's her gift, Charles? Eating? Pipe throwing? It's ok. Oh, yeah. Take the gun. Dump the body. Text me when you're on the way back. You have anything else you need? Food for the kid? You're fucked now, mutie. It's ok. Choo-choo. It's not a choochoo. It's ok. Sit down. We gotta go. What? What's going on? Stay here. Where? Don't move. Where are we going? Hey, don't worry. He will be back for you. Logan, the girl. You've got to go back for the girl. Logan, what about the girl? Logan. Logan, we must not forget about Laura. She's not our problem. Shit. Shit! Shit! Logan. Yeah, I'm thinking. The child. Logan, we must not forget Laura. Please be quiet. Logan. Charles Xavier. Where's Caliban? America's most wanted octogenarian. I'm a nonagenarian, actually. Where's Caliban? Why don't you tell me where the girl is first? Or I could ask Cue Ball. He seems quite friendly. I told you, she's not here. Where's Caliban, motherfucker? Well, I left him in the same ditch he was gonna leave me in. Jesus Wolverine, seeing you like this just breaks my damn heart. As soon as I rip it out of your chest, fuck-stick. Go get her. Laura. That a girl! Hey, baby. Laura... Laura! Honey, you wanna stay where you are. You wanna see your friends, right? Command, stop. You said alive or dead. Laura! Laura. Laura. No. No. Move! Go! Move! Go! Stop shooting! She heals! Move! Go! Holy shit! Gotcha! Come on, hold her down. As I told you Logan, she's a mutant like you. Hold on! Very much like you. Laura, are you all right? Move! Hold on! Fuck! Come on! Come on! Shit. Fall in! Let's go! Oh, watch out! Sit back. Bring me the tracker. You. Who the hell are you? Hey! I asked you a question. Who are you? You know who she is, Logan. No, I don't. Does she remind you of anybody? I read about you when I was a kid. I believe you're thinking of someone else. Now, if I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team. You were helping round up all those old mutes. What changed? You got religion? I'm gonna need you, to do one more thing for the good guys, and track one more special mute for me. I'm not helping you. Of course you'd say that. But I got a theory that people don't really change. Beware of the light. Caliban I bet that's what your mama told you every day when you was a kid. Beware of the light. Now, let's not bring out the worst in each other. The girl is not worth it, trust me. She's not a natural fuck-up like you. She's a business mistake, a R&D gone bad. There's liability. They can't have things with patents running around, hurting people, can they? We need to get her off the board, before she hurts anybody else. Someone you care about, maybe. So, get to sniffing. My name is Gabriela Lopez. I am a nurse. And for 10 years, I worked for Transigen Research in Mexico City. Transigen is owned by an American company. What I am about to show you is illegal... in the U.S. and Canada. They told us we were part of a pharmaceutical study. But of course that was a lie. These children were born in Transigen. They were born here... and have never left. They have never seen the sun or the ocean, rain or snow, or any of God's creatures. They have no birth certificates, no names, besides the ones we have given them. They were raised in the bellies, of Mexican girls. Girls no one can find anymore. Their fathers are semillas geneticas, special seeds in bottles. Birthday? No birth. Maria. We do not dress them up for Halloween. We do not call them baby or kiss boo-boos. Don't think of them as children. Think of them as things with patents and copyrights. Comprende? Si, senor. They thought we were too poor and stupid to understand. We're poor yes, but we are not stupid. Use your powers. This is business. They are making soldiers. Killers. These are babies of mutantes... North Dakota. You took that woman's money. You said you would take the child there. What is she? She's your daughter, Logan. Alkali has your genetic code. Not just mine. Logan. I don't want to talk about it. I don't wanna hear about it anymore. Logan. Just stop. I have to pee. Last ride. You're welcome. Stop it. For God's sake, I can do this myself! Yeah, well, you're not doing it. Just get on with it. Not with you standing there. Trust me, I'm not looking. Hello. Hi, there! You know you gotta pay for that, right? Hey! Where's your mommy and daddy? Come on. That's enough. These, too. Shit! Not ok! Sorry. Do you sell phone chargers? Come on. Get in the car. As the children became older, Laura. Laura. they became more difficult. They could not be controlled. The company made their bodies into weapons. Tried to teach them to kill. But they did not want to fight. A soldier who will not fight is useless. Inside this building, they are working on something new. Something they think is better than the children. Something they say is, without a soul. Would you like to hear my full lab report, Dr. Rice? You can't get good sushi here. It's the Mexican equivalent of Denver, Colorado. They must have been successful. About a week ago, they told us to shut our program down. They started putting the children to sleep. We are going to save as many children as we can. I read about a place, up north. A place for mutants. They call it Eden. If you are watching this... it means that I am dead. I am not sure if any other children survived. We were separated. There is no more money. That was a lie. She's not my child. But I love her. You may not love her. But she is your child. Please I beg you, take her to safety. Is this where we're hiding out? We're not hiding out. We're gonna get a couple of hours' sleep, clean up, get some new clothes, get a new ride and get outta here. Harrah's Hotel and Casino welcomes you to Oklahoma City. Please keep right for valet parking. Hey. The fun never stops at Harrah's Hotel and Casino. Hey, keep it out front, all right? Come on, let's go. Hey, Laura. Let's go. We need clothes. Going up. No, no, stop. Not a toy. No, no, sorry, chair. What? Ok. Push up again. Thank you. Going up. Come here. Stand there. Just stand there. Logan, it's... it's yours. What? I'm not gonna wear it now. Just in the room. ok. We'll get changed in the room. This is a very famous picture, Laura. It's almost 100 years old. I first saw this picture at the Essoldo Cinema in my hometown, when I was your age. Shit. You read these in your spare time? Oh, yeah, Charles, we got ourselves an X-Men fan. You do know they're all bullshit, right? Maybe a quarter of it happened, and not like this. In the real world, people die. And no self-promoting asshole in a fucking leotard can stop it. This is ice cream for bed-wetters. Logan. Her nurse has been feeding her some grade-A. Bullshit. I don't think Laura needs reminding of life's impermanence. Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride? Two more pills, in one hour. Give 'em to him. Why, Shane? A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mold. I tried it and it didn't work for me. Joey, there's no living with a killing. There's no going back from one. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand sticks. Now you run on home to your mother, and tell her everything's all right. And there aren't any more guns in the valley. Who are you guys? More cops? 'Cause I told the other guys everything that I... Get up! In your cage, tracker. You did your job. Whats the fuck iis this? Fellas. Shit. Knock yourselves out. I'll tell you what. Eight grand. I'll have her freshly painted for you, new tires, mounted, balanced, and complete paperwork. I'll give you 10 as-is, if you can forget the paperwork. Well, you still need new tires man, they're bald. How long will that take? An hour. Jesus. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Sir, are the keys in... Sir! You have the keys in it? Sir! Shit! Charles. Charles! Going up. Oh, shit! You all right? We gotta get outta here. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Emergency personnel are still on scene at Harrah's Casino Hotel in Oklahoma City, where at least 400 guests were stricken with temporary paralysis yesterday. Many are noting a similarity to the Westchester incident over a year ago, that left over 600 injured, and took the lives of seven mutants, including several of the X-Men. Knock it off. I said, knock it off! She's a child, Logan. And, point of fact, she's your... How long has it been since you took your meds? Tell me, how long has it been? I don't know! Two days. You saw what happened yesterday. If that shit had gone on any longer, everyone in that casino... I did what I had to do to save Laura. You didn't do anything. You just freaked out and had a fucking seizure! I guess you prefer me pharmaceutically castrated, rambling on like a lunatic. So much easier for you. Easier? Jesus! There is nothing easy about you, Charles. Yeah. Nothing! Yes. Please be like the rest of the world, blaming someone else for your boring shit. I know Pop, I'm such a giant disappointment. You honestly derive no sense of purpose, from what we're doing? Ok. What are we doing? There is a young mutant, sitting in our car. Yeah, I see that. And where we're taking her, there are others. Does that mean nothing to you? Yeah. Yeah, means nothing to me. Especially since Nurse Gabriela, made all that Eden shit up with fucking comic books. What are you talking about? Give those to him, will you? Take out two pills and give them to him. Logan! Logan! Give 'em to him. Now! I wanna see it. Dr. Rice. It's under control. Motherfucking auto-trucks. Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine. Oh, what? She can gut a man with her feet, she can't hear a few naughty words? She can learn to be better. You mean, better than me? Actually, yes. And by the way, Laura's foot claws, are the obvious result of her gender, you know. Is that a fact? In a pride of lions, the female is both hunter and caregiver. Good to know. She uses her front claws for hunting, and the back claws defensively. Oh, yeah? Thus, ensuring their survival. Hey, hey! We should help them. No, we have to keep going. Someone will come along. Someone has come along. Alert. Alert. Hey, you need a hand? Ready? Go! Good, got it. Come on, let's get home. Laura! Thank you so much for your help. I'm Kathryn. James. This is my son, Nate. Hi. Hey. That's your daughter? Yeah, that's Laura, and that's my dad, Chuck. Come on Laura, let's go. Well, can we show our appreciation and treat the three of you to a decent meal? We don't live far from here. No, thanks. That would be lovely! My name is Dr. Rice. But you can call me Zander if you like. My colleague tells me you've been somewhat resistant. He believes you've been dispensing delayed information, to allow your friends to stay one step ahead. I'm offering you the possibility of redemption, Caliban. To protect the world, and in the process, save your friends. The girl is a rather small price to pay for that. Unlike you, she's impure. She wasn't made by nature. She's a mistake of my own. I did what I could and they burned me and beat me. Your colleagues are savages. I agree. The Reavers were very ineffective. But I'm bringing new tools to bear. But I still need someone to point us in the right direction. No, I can't help you. Breathe, breathe. Now, what does he have? The old man. Alzheimer's? ALS? A degenerative brain disease in the world's most dangerous brain? What a combo. Be nice. Now, you know we got company. That's wonderful. Everybody, have a seat. Nate, sit up. James, why don't you sit at the end of the table? You wanna say grace? Say grace, baby. Thank you, God, for this food, and for our new friends, the Howletts. They came to our aid. Amen. Amen. Here we go. Here you go, Charles. Thank you, sir. Oh, there's plenty more if she wants. She's fine. Thank you. This is delicious. Oh, thank you. It's so good. Where are you all headed? Oregon. South Dakota. Well, Oregon and then South Dakota. Vacation? Yes. Long overdue. We're city folk. Always wanted to take a road trip, see the country. And meet the people in it. That sounds lovely. Been trying to get Will here to take a vacation for years now. If we go traipsing all over the country, who's gonna take care of this place? Exactly. I say, let it go. And live off what? The Lord will provide. I'm still waiting for the Lord to provide me with a new thresher. All the same, I'd love to travel someday. And I bet you will. I could drop out of school. Ok, let's not go that far. I mean, I'll do it. No. No. Why not? You wanna travel, I wanna travel. Son. Son. That sounds good to you, right? This is the perfect plan. Why would you want to do that, Nate? Careful, you're speaking to a man who ran a school, so... for a lot of years. Right, Charles? Yes, it was a... It was a special needs school. That's a good description. He was there, too. Oh, yeah, no. I got kicked out a few times. I wish I could say you were a good pupil, but the words would choke me. Ma'am I like it, thank you enough for this... It was great, but we have a long drive... But you need to rest, don't you? Yeah, we'll find a motel somewhere. The nearest one is two hours from here and it's not even that nice. We have a perfectly fine room upstairs for your father and your daughter and you can sleep in the living room on the convertible. Kathryn, it's very, very nice of you, but we really should go. Logan, we can leave early in the morning. Break of dawn, as it were. Ok, why don't we wash up, Pop? Ok. Sit. Sweetie, you want some dessert? Two days on the road, only one meal and hardly any sleep. She's 11, I'm fucking 90. Well, that's 101 reasons to keep moving. I'm not a box of avocados, Logan. And then what? We stay the night, then what? Then we take her to her friends in Eden. And then we buy the Sunseeker. Take the pills. Oh, shit! What's going on? Nate! Go fill up the tub before we lose pressure. Honey, check the sink. They shut it off again. They are just not going to let this thing go. Well, you might as well handle it now. It can wait till the morning. We just had rain last night. We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes. All right, all right. The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here. Sometimes it gets itself shut off. By assholes. Hey! No. My son is happy to go with you. No, no, no, that's fine. The men that do this, sometimes they can be... I can go. No, you got homework. All right, I'll go. Just, let me get my dad settled. All right. I'm just saying, I don't care what the lawyer says. But it's dangerous. I'm not gonna hurt our chances. Want TV? There's TV here. I'm fine. Ok. Get some rest. You know, Logan... this is what life looks like. A home, people who love each other. Safe place. You should take a moment and feel it. Yeah. It's great. Logan. Logan! You still have time. Charles the world, is not the same as it was. We're taking a risk hanging around here, you know that. And where we're going, Eden. It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book. You understand? It's not real. It is for Laura. It is for Laura. Get some rest. Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here, except for us. When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain, then screwing with our water. Couple of months ago, somebody poisoned our dogs. So, out on the highway today, those trucks. Who knows. Maybe. Hey, look at them. Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains, shucking their cloned-up super corn. You know it tastes like shit, too. Why do people eat it? They don't. They drink it. Corn syrup. It's in those drinks that everyone's having, to stay awake, cheer up, feel strong, sexy, whatever. Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day. Mine still are. Those are for breakaway roping. Those are for barrel racing, and right here is for pole bending. They're all second, third place. I'm not too good at it, but my dad makes me. Do you want to listen? Do you like it? Here, you can take it for tonight... and I'll get it back from you in the morning. Looks like we're gonna be here a while. Should hold it. Yeah. Till next time. Thanks. Hey, so... how long has your girl been like that? Mute. Since... Since the beginning. Well, in a lot of ways, I envy you. They get to be Nate's age, with the nonsense that comes out of their mouths. Makes you wonder the whole point of it all. Shit. Don't worry. We won't need it. Stay here. Evening, Mr. Munson. What brings y'all this way? Why don't you ask your boys? Mr. Munson, you understand you're trespassing right now, right? I have an easement with the previous owner of your property. Bullshit. Previous being the operative word. Who's this? Just a guy telling you to get back in your nice truck. Go play Okie dickhead somewhere else. Hey, Carl... it looks like Mr. Munson hired some muscle. Looks that way. He's a friend of mine. A friend with a big mouth. I hear that a lot. Then you probably hear this, too. More than I'd like. Then you know the drill. I'mma count to three... and you're gonna start walking away. I got rights to this water. One. I have a lawyer now. Two. Three. You all right, boss? You know the drill. Pick up my goddamn hat. Get the hell out of here. You ok, boss? Fuck off. Go! You've had training. Some. Hey, don't wake her yet. Let her sleep another hour. You know Logan, this was without a doubt, the most perfect night I've had in a very long time. But I don't deserve it. Do I? I did something. Something unspeakable. I've remembered what happened in Westchester. This is not the first time I've hurt people. Until today, I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me. So we just kept on running away from it. I think I finally understand you. Logan... He's fantastic. You said you only needed the girl! I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear. Your friends had every chance. And so did you. Nate? Put her down. Honey. Stay down there, Will! Stop! Kathryn! Kathryn! Kathryn! Charles! Charles! Hold this. It wasn't me. It wasn't me. Here he comes. I could pick him up, meet him halfway. No, no, no. Let them come to us. We struggled with the X-23s. We assumed, because they were children we could raise them without a conscience. But you can't nurture rage. You must simply design it, from scratch. Who the fuck is that? Will Munson! Just hold on, Charles. Munson, god damn it, come out here! Munson! Come out here now! Come out here now, Munson. There's that asshole. Hello, asshole. Listen, I'm willing to let bygones be bygones. I don't know what Munson's paying you, but Canewood can start you out at five G. A week, that is. You best stay where you are, pal. I'm the law out here. No, no, no. What in high... What? Oh, shit! Shoot him! We need to intervene. Well, he only listens to you, Doctor. 24! Get back here! Stop! Stop now! Hold this down, right now, tight! Our boat. What? The Sunseeker. No. Come! 24! Need some help out here! I guess we're gonna have to take care of this now. Pierce! Give me that. Get your lily-faced ass out here! Listen to me! What the fuck do you think you're doing? All right, we gotta go around that truck and flank them farmers. Follow my lead. Bring extra ammo, take these clips. Come! Now! Pick her up. Beware the light. What the hell are you? Sit down. Hold still. Hold still. Get him on the truck. Yeah. Go. It's all right, it's all right. It's all right. You did fine, 24. You're healing. Just breathe. You're a newborn, by any measure. Just breathe. Your body has work to do. Hemostasis, angiogenesis, epithelialization, stromal cell proliferation. This will help you heal. Make you stronger. Well... It's got water, and... It's got water. Fuck this. Fuck this. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Motherfucking... Shit! Fuck! Fuck! Welcome back. I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell, that nice little girl, out in the waiting room her daddy's gone. I... I'd always hoped... that I'd get the chance to meet someone like you. There's so few of you left. Nice to meet you too, Doc. But I really got to get on my way. No, no, don't do that. What you need is rest, and treatment. You need to check yourself in somewhere. I'll be fine. No, you're not! I mean, I mean, I know I know that you're different but... that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you. You got to check yourself into a hospital. Find out what it is! I know what it is. Please, mister, if you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can help you. Maybe I can run some tests. Look, Doc. You seem like a nice guy, all right? You wanna save a life, save your own. Forget we were here. Let's go. Hey! Hey! You can't just take shit, you know. I don't know how you got me here but... thank you. De nada. Yeah. You can talk? You can talk? What the fuck? Why in the fuck... What's all this bullshit been for the last 2,000 fucking miles? What? Shut up. Shut up! Shut up the fuck up! Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah, Rictor. Jonah, Who's that? Who's that? Gideon, Who is that? Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca, Delilah and Rictor. North Dakota. What? North Dakota, por favor. Shit, Ok. Look... No. Por favor. This place. Ok? Your nurse, she read too many stories, you understand? Too many stories! I've seen it! I've seen it, Ok? This all here... None of this. No, no existo, Ok? You understand me? This Eden does not exist. Sii! No. No. Si Eden! It's a fantasy, kid. See that? Those are the names of the people who just made this... They made this whole thing up. Ok? This whole... It happened once, and they just turned it into a big, fucking lie! That's all this is. No! Fuck. No. I know, I understand. This is a long way. You understand? I am not taking you to North Dakota. I am fucked up. And I cannot get you there. It is a two-day drive. And I am not taking you... Don't fucking hit me! Don't hit me! Jonah, Gideon, Rebecca. Stop saying those names. Delilah, Right now. Rictor. Jonah. Stop saying those names. Gideon. Stop it! Rebecca. Delilah. Stop! Rictor. Jonah. Fuck it. Fine, fine. You wanna go? I'll take you there. See for yourself. Let's go to fucking fantasyland. We understand the importance of containment, Dr. Rice. But you can't leave a war zone behind like you did in Juarez. Well, try to remind yourselves that these are all little killing machines. Machines who would've happily disemboweled your family. Not all. I was told you want these assets off-board, dead or alive. Are you changing my brief? No. All right, then. Save tissue from this one. He's a good tracker and had a high IQ. Here you go. Hey. Let me drive. Absolutely not. Quit looking at me. No comprende. You are dying. You want to die. Charles told me. What else did he tell you? To not let you. Hey, hey, hey! Rest. Keep it steady. Swing him toward me. Yeah. Easy. Easy Is this good, Rictor? No, not so much. Less. Hey! Where am I? Hey, what is it? Where did you get that? Where we came from. They gave it to us when we would fight. It makes you stronger. It makes you crazy, is what it does. It'll kill you. No, not if you use it in small doses. It's helping you heal. Where's Laura? She's asleep down there. Do you want me to wake her up? No. You had a nightmare. Do you have nightmares? Si. People hurt me. Mine are different. I hurt people. You know what it is. It's made out of Adamantium. It's what they put inside of us. That's why it can kill us. Probably what is killing me now. Anyway. I got this a long time ago... and I kept it as a reminder of what I am. Now I keep it to. Actually I... I was thinking of shooting myself with it. Like Charles said. I've hurt people too. You're gonna have to learn how to live with that. They were bad people. All the same. Not funny. That is not funny! Hey! Hey, pal. How long have I been out? How long have I been in that bed? Two days. You've been sitting here for two days? Hey, go inside and tell everyone to get packing. You can't do that. You can't just stay here. We had to wait. It was the plan. And everyone had till today to find their way here. If you keep waiting, Alkali will find you and they will kill you all. You need to get out! We're leaving tomorrow before dawn. We're gonna cross the border. It's a safe haven. Same coordinates? Yes, between noon and 5:00. Satellites are blind then. Your asylum approved. Copy. Swing it to your right, Laura. A little more. Yeah. You see the woods? Si. It's an eight mile hike through there. And you see that pass? That's the border. That's where we will be safe. Come inside. Laura told me all that you did for her. She was lucky to have you. Take it. She says it's yours. That's why you did it, right? Yeah, well... Look, I don't need it. You do, ok? Suit yourself. Your friends, they seem nice. Kind of reminds me... Hey, hey, what's going on? You're with your pals. You made it. Where will you go? Nearest bar for starters. Hey, I got you here. That's all I signed up for. I even gave back the money. Such a nice man. Hey, I never asked for this! All right. Charles never asked for this. Caliban never asked for this. And they are six feet under the ground! Now, I don't know what Charles put in your head, but I am not whatever it is you think I am, Ok? I only met you like a week ago. You got your Rebecca, your Delilah, your blah, blah, blah, whatever. Everything you asked for, you've got it! And it is better this way. Because I suck at this. Bad shit happens to people I care about. You understand me? Then I'll be fine. Run! Towards the mountains! Run! Run, Bobby, run! Go! Go! Move faster! We need to reach them before they get to the border. Move out! Let's go, let's go! Run! Run! Corre, Jonah! Run! I want you to breathe. It's just a flesh wound, baby. There she is. We got her. Back it up! Contain her. Get behind me! You took all the medicine. It's wearing off. Go to your friends. Go. Laura? You'll know when. Nine o'clock. That green juice is wearing off? You know, for an old mute, it's kind of a short high. Be hard to keep them claws out, soon. Waste this dick, Logan! Please stop, Mr. Howlett. I'm gonna have to tell these men to fire on these children. You don't want that. You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off. You will not survive further wounds. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Zander Rice. I believe you knew my father on the Weapon X Program. Yeah. He's the asshole who put this poison in me. Yes, he was one of them. I think I might have killed him. I think you're right. Why don't you show some respect, mutie? You're looking at the man who wiped out your kind. My friend Donald overstates. He makes it sound more brutal than intended. The goal was not to end mutant kind, but to control it. I realized, we needn't stop perfecting what we eat and drink. That we could use those products to perfect ourselves. To distribute gene therapy discreetly through everything, from sweet drinks to breakfast cereals. And it worked. Random mutancy went the way of polio. We embarked on our next endeavor. Growing mutants of your own. Precisely. Dangerous times. James you can't... Showtime, boy! Get up, boy. Get up, boy! He did that. Get up! Laura! No! Laura! Please. Go. Let's go. Go. Go, go, go! Go! Get out of here! Go! Go. Go, go, go! Go, go! Go! Run! No! No! No, no. No. Take your friends and run. No. Run. They'll keep coming and coming. Listen, you don't have to fight anymore. Go, go. Don't be what they made you. Laura... Laura... Daddy. So, this is what it feels like. No! No! Daddy. Dad. A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mold. There's no living with a killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now you run on home to your mother. You tell her everything's all right. There are no more guns in the valley. Let's go. We gotta move. By LESAIGNEUR Sync & corrections September 2017
