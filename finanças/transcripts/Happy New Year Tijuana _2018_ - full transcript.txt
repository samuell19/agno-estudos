How's it going? Good. Are you going downtown? Yes, please. Can you take me to a hotel, please? Of course. What kind of hotel, like...? A hotel... one that's comfortable... not too expensive. Oh, I've got a very good one. How was your flight? No, I missed it. There was no flight. Oh you missed it? How come? I arrived a little late. And they didn't want to help you out, huh? How's life in Tijuana? We're hanging in there. Not too bad, it's good. Things are calm. It's not too dangerous? No, it just has a bad reputation. It's good... everything is good here. It's a good place to enjoy the night. Do you go to the US? No, I can't really go... because of the visa and those things. I don't have time for that stuff. Do you go? I live there. Well...lived. Oh, lived? I'm coming back to Mexico. You didn't enjoy life over there? Yes and no. This is Lomas Taurinas. Remember? That's where they say they gunned down Colosio. Where the church is? Yeah... just below there. Years ago, right? Yeah, that was in like ninety-two or around then? Yeah, it was there - Lomas Taurinas. What do you think about that? Oh, well I think... it's a cover-up, right? Tijuana's big. Are you married? Have you got kids? You look worried, sir. You'll see, at the hotel we're going to you're gonna have a good time. Do you like tacos? Yeah, more or less. Which ones? Asada, or...? The maciza ones. With steamed tortillas. Do they sell them in Tijuana? You've got everything close to the hotel. But do they sell the ones I like? Head tacos with steamed tortillas? Yeah, all kinds. Very tasty. That one thinks he's Superman. Like they say in my hometown... must be a rubber man. This is where the paraditas are. What are the paraditas? Those are the many girls who are standing around here. Are they prostitutes? Yes. Most of them. Look, this is the hotel. Which one is it? That one over there. Listen, can we go to a different place? Nah, this is good. It's very good here. Look, and those are the tacos I told you about. The tacos? Take me to another place, please. It looks kind of dangerous. No, don't worry about it. Come on, you're gonna like it. You're gonna have a good time. I guarantee it. OK, thank you. Have a good new year. You, too. You'll be good here. Fucking taxi driver. Yes, from six twenty-nine. Big favor. Can you wake me up at eight in the morning tomorrow, please? Oh no, you know what? At six. At six because my flight leaves at eight. Yes, please. OK, that's the deal. Thank you. What the fuck? Is this for sleeping or what? They must be acrobats. Ah, three beds. That's how they are, Ma. It's not like the bus there - it's a plane. That's how they are. Yes, exactly. Very organized. Not in Los Angeles, I'm in Tijuana. Because it was less expensive from here. Remember I don't have much money now. No, don't worry, it's pretty safe. Yes, I'm in a hotel. I'm in a hotel here. It's... it's elegant. Sorry. They actually have three... they have three beds. Well, two...two and a little one. Yeah, it's a...it's a pretty neighborhood. Yes, it's quiet around here. I feel sad also. I wanted to see you all. Enjoy the tamale feast. Save some for me. And some champurrado cause I'm gonna arrive hungry. Give a strong hug to Pa. To my sisters and my brother also, please. OK, Ma. Enjoy the celebration. Happy New Year. See you tomorrow. No, thank you. But come here. What do you want? How does it work? Two-ninety. For everything? No, from the waist down. And for everything? Four-fifty. Pesos? Come on. It's just... it's just... What's the problem? Why are you a prostitute? Get the fuck out of here, asshole. Son of a filthy whore! Faggot! Son... you come from far away, right? More or less. I was looking at you from here and I noticed your aura is very dark. You're on a dead-end road. Somebody must've put a spell on you to prevent you from reaching your destination. Something's telling me that... you're in danger. I would like to read your cards. The cards? Yes, the cards. In the cards you can see the future. Is that expensive? No, it's cheap. Let's do it. What's your name, whitey? Alejandro. Alejandro Serna. You came from far away, right? No, I'm coming from Los Angeles now, but I'm originally from Guanajuato. Let's see what the tarot tells us about you. Cut it in three with your left hand. Put your hand... for me...for my present. For my past. And for my future. The cards say that...you have cried a lot. That you had a problem. Somewhere...in a relationship. It seems like somebody got fired from their job. There is a young lady... who thinks about you a lot. And there's another one... who's close to you who shows a lot of interest. It talks about a lot of interest from this dark-skinned young lady. You like dark-skinned women, right? Well... I don't discriminate. You don't discriminate? It shows... there are a lot of people around you. Those people are gonna get close to you, but be careful because there is also danger. Danger...from other people. It says that there's a dark-skinned man. It seems like this guy... feels some jealousy toward you. You've gotta be careful with him. It says that he's aware of what you do and what you say. You have a lot of enemies. It's telling me that. Does it say why? Yes, it says that it's because of work-related problems. Disagreements. Misunderstandings. And it could also be because of... racial issues. It talks about racism. It says that sometimes at night you get sad...melancholic...you feel lonely. It talks about a lot of loneliness. Your aura looks dirty. That's why all these things are happening to you. Do I get it dirty or do other people? How does it get dirty? The aura usually gets dirty because we do negative things. And also because of other people's envy. We are like energy. And energy also gets dirty. And when that happens everything in us gets stuck. And prayer cleans the aura? Prayer is very important. It's fundamental. I'm still a sinner in the flesh... but repented in the presence of God. He knows the struggle inside me. What hurts me. He knows... all about me. And also about you. God is talking to you. What you need to be wary of is spiritual death. The word death means separation. When you physically die, your soul and your body get separated. But when you die spiritually, your soul could go to Hell... And it won't come back to God, who's the one who wants to save you. Good evening. Good evening. What do you sell here? Hot dogs and hamburgers. Give me a hot dog, please. With everything? Yes, what do you put on it? Mayonnaise, tomato, onion, ketchup, mustard, chile and cheese. Cheese? What kind of cheese? Liquid cheese. Ah, liquid? OK. Everything? Yes, please. Thank you, Happy New Year. Same to you. A flower. Hey, look! Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You speak Spanish? Yes, I'm from Guanajuato. Ah, nice to meet you. Welcome to Tijuana. Thank you. My sister, you met her. Yes, we met. Thank you. So you used to be Ana's teacher? Well yes, I used to. Chicano Studies. What's that about? Chicano Studies, well, it's... we don't have it in Mexico, but... it's basically about the struggles of Mexican-Americans who live in the United States. And their fight for social equality... political equality...equality at work. Basically something like that. It's very interesting. You should give some classes later. Of course, of course, we'll talk about it. Are you interested...? Cheers to the Chicanos. Fuck yeah! Happy New Year! Excuse me. Professor... a bong hit? No, thank you. No, thank you. The thing is... I don't smoke weed. Well... in part because... I understand some Spanish, OK? That's right, she speaks perfectly. So keep going. OK, in Spanish. Whatever you want. Tell him, my love. A bong hit, my professor. For New Year's. For New Year's. Don't bullshit me, professor. That was in the past. They don't care about weed anymore. Didn't you watch "Breaking Bad?" There's the answer - "Breaking Bad." Come on, don't be a pussy. You're missing out, this is... Come on, let's do it. Inhale, professor, inhale! Inhale hard! Harder, inhale inhale! More, more! Harder! Good, professor, good. Your eyes. Let me see. Oh shit! ...if you're not here. Bravo, Bernie. Professor, professor! Let's see, something, something, something... let's see if you like it. Bring it on. Take it easy, Sylvio Rodríguez. It's time to go now. Let's go. Andiamo, Chucho. Take it easy, Sylvio Rodríguez. You're gonna make me cry, homie. It's time. I really like how you played. Congratulations. I've always wanted to play guitar. Oh really? Thank you. Yeah, if you could teach me I would really like to learn. Guitar? I played so badly, so many mistakes. Did you notice I couldn't remember it? I want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to celebrate the new year with you. Thank you very much. He crashed it, he crashed it. I crashed it. Luis, Carla, thank you very much. Now I'll light it for you. So you missed your flight? Where were you going? I was going to - I was just five minutes late, can you believe it? Really? Yes. To Guanajuato. León, Guanajuato. Do you live there, or...? My family... my family's from there. You were going to spend New Year's Eve there? But I missed my flight, and... you know what? What? I don't care. Are you having fun? In fact, I'm having a blast. That's good. Tijuana's very cool, I like it a lot. I'm having a blast. You don't smoke much? Yes... yes. A little. Not much, but a little. Like the gringo would say - I like Tijuana. In the United States they... don't know or don't want to know about the quality... of the Mexican people. The mainstream media only talks about... oh, those Mexicans... here they come, the drug smugglers... the gangsters... the drunks... the ones who take advantage of welfare. Those are the Mexicans that the gringos think we are. But they don't know about the great culture we have. They don't know. They have no idea about our ancestry and all the culture of our history. And besides that, they have no idea about all the heart that Mexicans put into everything they do. Towards their family and the work they do. The passion? Yes, a lot of passion, a lot of heart... they do everything with a lot of enthusiasm. I mean, they cry. The Mexican is more sentimental than it seems like. They have no idea about the warmth that the Mexican has. It doesn't matter where you're from, the Mexican is very welcoming. Very, very warm... very horny! No, warm! Horny! I scared you. You got scared. You got scared! Go ahead, sir. Failure? I'm not afraid of anything. A little. Alright, we're all gathered here together in this little corner of Tijuana - Tribeca! All together as friends, as family... we're all here tonight to celebrate, get down, and get drunk to welcome the new year! How are all you drunk Tijuana people doing down there? Together as a family... come on, let me see everybody with your right hand up. All the way up, up, up! Everybody put your hand up! Happy New Year Tijuana! Happy New Year, motherfuckers! This is for girls. Get me a shot please, sister. Hey. I need to tell you something. What you're doing is OK. It's OK, don't be ashamed. You, brother... don't need these. Take them off, look... you can see, master. Really? You can see, you don't need this. You can do it because you see with your mind. You understand? You can see better. Better than anybody else. And you know what I'm talking about. Now enjoy. Thank you. Masters. What...what's up? How are you doing? Master - look at me, look at me. Cut this fucking hair, man. What? Really, I'm serious. Bernardo... What do you want? He's Bernardo. No, Bernardo! What? OK there you are. There you are. We got it. We got it! What are you talking about? Since we got here... since the house, he's been looking at her. Looking and looking. He gets close to her, then he makes eyes at her and shit. You think I don't notice? You think I'm stupid? She's got a very nice dress. Do you like women or men? Tell him the truth. Men. Men? Look, if you like women that's OK. It's not a problem. Right? Johnny, we're already there, homie. We're there! Nothing else is needed. You know it, homie. Nothing! OK, people. I'll be right back. Have another shot. I'll be back for another shot. You OK? Professor Serna. Are you OK, Professor Serna? You know. Leave him. Leave him, Ana. Leave him today. Enough. Hold on, hold on. You'd better stop, better stop. You're making a fool of yourself, brother. No. No, I'm not making a fool of myself. Stop it now, fucker! That's enough! Stop being a pain in the ass, you son of a bitch! Luis, she's not for you. Stop talking to my girl, asshole! Shut the fuck up - don't touch me, fucker! Now! Get the fuck out of here! Get the fuck out of here! Leave me alone! Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out of here! It's over, it's over, relax. Can you hear me? Sir, can you hear me? Sir, I need to make a phone call, can I have a coin? From the ones that are in your bucket? I need to call my mom, sir... I'll give you my scarf and I'll pay you later. I'm gonna take a coin, sir... but I'm gonna pay you later, OK? Hey sir, sir. Listen to me. Enough! Stop drinking! Listen to me. Listen, listen! Look into my eyes! There, there, hold it, hold it! Stop drinking now. Now! Wait, wait! Sir, I'm talking to you - it's time to stop drinking. Look at his pupils. I like his necklace. How much did you pay for it, boy? Are you mute? Can I see it? Are you a faggot? Can I see it? That thing's fake. You think so? Fantasy. Well, I hope it protects you. Hey. What do you want? Can I sit here? Hey, sir. Can I tell you something? Yeah, but right now I'm sleeping, brother. Yeah, but just quickly, quickly. OK, go ahead. Because it's urgent. Go ahead. They're following me. Who's following you? All of them. I don't know if it's the police... or even normal people. They look normal. You know how they are. They're undercover. I notice. I see them... and then they look at me... and I notice. Those fuckers don't fool me. They're driving in their cars... and when they realize I see them, they pretend to be on their phone. They don't fool me. And why are they looking for you? Because this is my last day. They wanna kill you or what? They want to eliminate me because... I'm not good for them, you know? Do you know something about them? Everything. It's been... it's been a long time since I've been to confession. Can I confess to you? Please? But... Please. To confess you need somebody who has that gift, but... Can you listen to me? Yes, yes, of course. Because... I need to confess, sir. Get it all out. Well... I've done many bad things, you know. I haven't followed the Word of God. But most of all... but most of all, what... what hurts me the most... I have failed my people. To "la raza." I've failed the community... the "movimiento." Let it out. I've failed the "movimiento." That's what hurts the most. That's what hurts the most. That's my biggest sin. That's my biggest sin. Why today? There are so many things I can do... if He would give me the opportunity... the opportunity to try things again... a little more time, just a little more. Why today? I don't want to die...yet. I'm not too young, but I'm not old. I don't have a family yet. I want to have a family, I want to have kids. I haven't even gotten married yet. Why so soon? Why today? If only I could do something to avoid it, but I can't. Today I die. Don't worry about dying... compared to what I'm going through - enduring the cold and suffering... death would end my misery. Because living this life - suffering, enduring people's pity and disgust... it's better not to. At least somebody's interested in you to kill you. Nobody cares about me. That's true, huh? I'm a lucky one. At least you know you're going to die tonight... most people don't know when, so they won't have the opportunity to ask God for forgiveness. Even if your body's dying today, if you repent your soul can be saved. Otherwise both your body and soul will be lost. So it's up to you. Happy New Year. Same to you. Happy New Year, brother. A hug? Why not? Yes, sir! Happy New Year! Same to you. Good morning, Happy New Year. Good morning, same to you. I'm sorry, sir. Go ahead, don't worry. Good morning. Hello. Hello. It's me, from yesterday. The asshole. Listen, I want to apologize. For what? Well, you got angry yesterday. Good morning, sir. Good morning. What do you sell? Huaraches. Carne asada. Give me one, please. Have a seat. Thank you. But honestly, I want to apologize. Forget it. What a beautiful day, right? Gorgeous. Happy New Year. I wish you all the best and great health. Seedless grapes, strawberries! Do you have plans for today? You already have plans? Yes. With who? With nobody. I don't know if you notice... on the Mexican side there are a lot of houses, families... everybody sees what the border's like. But on the U.S. side... there's not one house. The first house is...I don't know how many kilometers or miles away. So people in the United States don't realize what happens. This is music from the Mexican Revolution. From the early nineteen-hundreds. They can't come over to this side? And you can't go on that side? General Pancho Villa was a very famous Mexican revolutionary. Like this. You don't even know. He invaded a town there and came back with his army. After that, the US Army went to Mexico looking for him for months, but they never found him. Because people would protect him. He's fast. Oh, it's Rodolfo Gaona. Who's that? He's the most famous bullfighter in Mexican history. And he's from Guanajuato... León, Guanajuato, where I'm from. He invented a lot of moves, with the cape, with... with the "muleta..." "La Gaonera" is his most famous one. And the first song I learned as a child... it was "Rodolfo Gaona." My grandmother taught it to me when I was about... five years old, more or less. I am Rodolfo Gaona... the brave one with the Mexican sword. There's no bullfighter in Spain... who can compete with me in the Gypsy style. The horsemen are up and the bullfighters are down... and in the ring are all the banderilleros. Olé, bullfighter, there's nothing like it... the beautiful way you position yourself for the kill. Hey, sir! Can we take a look at the plaza? Oh we can. Come! How are you, sir? Nice to meet you, Alejandro. José Francisco. It's a pleasure. And what's the dog's name? Billy. Billy. Hello, Billy. Where do the bullfighters enter from? That way, from cuadrillas. Cuadrillas, right? Can you take us? Of course. Please. Thank you. The plaza's big. It's the third in the world. The third largest? That's the entrance, right? Yes, all the way down. I'll be back. He already thinks he's a bullfighter. Come on, let's watch him from the stands. Help me. Oh, now I'm a chaperone. For you. Who's this crazy man?
