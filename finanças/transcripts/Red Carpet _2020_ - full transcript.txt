(film clicking) (mellow music) - What can I do for you today? - I just want some insight I guess about what the future brings. - Have you done a reading before? - Never had a reading done before. - So is it anything in particular that you're looking for? I suggest we go for a deep reading. How does that sound? - Yeah. - Whatever the cards tell me, good or bad, I'm going to tell you. The fool indicates mistakes that we make in life, like foolish decisions. The devil tells me that there's temptation too far away and you really have to be careful. The moon indicates that your aspirations or dreams, they're probably a distant reality. - Does that mean my dreams are within reach? - Well, not necessarily. I can see success in life, but it can be in a different area that is unknown right now to you. 'Cause I can see strengths and I can see new beginnings but maybe not in the field that you are at right now. - Does that mean that I don't have a future in Hollywood? - [Psychic] You're gonna find out with time.

Thanks. - Hi five. - Only way to make it in this world is by being strong. If you fail, you got to get yourself up. - Staring at the star of Marilyn Monroe. - Yes, she's one of my favorites. - She was fabulous. Oh wow, wasn't she? - Yeah. Way before my time but definitely an idol. - Yeah. Such a powerful performer. She made a big difference for women at that time. - She's one of the reasons I'm even here. - So where are you from? - Oh, I'm from Oakland, California. - Oh! And so you came down here to be a Hollywood star? - Yeah. I want to be an actress. - Wonderful. Why not? It's great to follow your dreams. - Right.
