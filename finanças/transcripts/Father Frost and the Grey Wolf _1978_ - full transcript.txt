[Fast lively music] GRANDPA FROST AND THE GREY WOLF [Song] "All are happy in the wood - The winter holiday's almost here! Grandpa Frost for the New Year Will bring gifts for everyone: Oranges for the rabbits, A scooter for the little squirrel, For the bear cub - a plane. Soon, soon is the New Year! Soon, soon is the New Year! Soon, soon, to visit the kids, Grandpa Frost himself will come! He'll gather everyone by the tree - There'll be games and there'll be joy! Hundreds of jokes and bright ideas And sweet gifts for the guests! Good snow and clear ice. Soon, soon is the New Year! Soon, soon is the New Year! - [Singing] Soon, soon is the New Year! [Alarming music] - Straight! Straight! Straight! Left! Straight! - [Screams] Hurrah! Hurrah! - Stop! - Hurrah! Hurrah! Soon comes the New Year! Hurrah! - Straight! - I'm all numb! It's no joke, to crawl through the whole forest under the snow on one's belly! - Sure, but nobody has seen you! And if they had, they would've cried "Wolf! Wolf!" And our entire enterprise would... be done for! - Is it much further? - Right over there! - Come on! [Phone rings] - Hello! Snow Maiden? Good day! So, the snowman's already brought the fir tree, and the decorations too? Good! Don't delay the snowman with a car - I have no time to spare! I still have to visit the little forest animals! What? You already visited them? That's good! [Knocking] - Who's there? [Crying] [Crying] Grandpa Frost: - What happened? - A sparrow broke his leg, and crumpled his wing - he's lying out there, freezing! - Oh, how terrible! Oh, the poor thing! Will you show me where to go? - Of course! It's not far! [Alarming music] [Shivers] [Music] - Where's the sparrow, then? Either the snow's covered him, or he's already flown off, or he was never there at all... - Maybe he was never there, maybe I was... mistaken, or maybe I just... tricked you! [Laughs] - Ah, you no-good bird! [Music] [Car zooms] - Hello, Chief! - Eh... Hold on, hold on... I'm coming out! [Fast music] [Snowman signaling] [Music] - Let's go! - Hey! Hey, where are you going?! I don't get it! Why did the snowman drive off? - Quickly! - Your voice somehow seems different... - I don't know. [Coughs] I've got a cold, probably! [Coughs] Bronchitis! - The Snow Maiden told you to hurry up! She told you to drive straight to the fir tree! - What're you going on about? "Told you, told you..." I'm telling you to drive straight to the hares! - Why to the hares? After all, the Snow Maiden told you... - To the hares! To the hares, or I'll... - Okay, boss. "To the hares" it is! - Grandpa Frost is coming! He's brought us gifts! Hurrah, hurrah! - Hey, shoo, you no-good hares! - Tell me, boss, why do you have such big teeth? - Just turn the steering wheel and shut up! - Get out! - What's going on? What mischief is this?! - I recognized you, you grey bandit! Get out of here! - You won't leave without me! You will drive me to the hares! - Oh, so? Come, come! Well, well ... [Alarming music] Give me back my nose! - Hey! Happy New Year! - Go where you want, but we're going to the hares! - Oh, what a happy bunny I am! I have four little boys, and [laughs] a really sweet daughter! Now we'll get the fir tree, decorate it, and then... then - the New Year! Ah! - Don't open the door for anyone, or Grey Wolf will come and take you away! Rabbits: - Hurrah! Soon comes the New Year! Hurrah! [Knocking] [Knock on door] - Who's there? - It's me... Grandpa Frost! - Hurrah! Hurrah! - But mom... mom said to not open the door for anyone! - Ha ha! But it's Grandpa Frost! - Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! - Grandpa Frost, how kind you are! How we love you! Oh, what a beautiful hat! Look, look! Grandpa Frost has ears just like ours! - Hurrah! Hurrah! - Grandpa Frost! Grandpa Frost! - Huh? - What about the gifts? - Ah, the gifts! Hold on, hold on! Climb into the bag, and you'll find... many gifts for yourselves! I... feel a bit bad about this! - Grandpa Wolf! Grandpa Wolf, please return the little hares to Mom and Dad! - I can't! I... need them myself! - Return the little hares! Ah! Let go of me! - Let go... of the little one! [Unintelligible] Oo-oo-oo-oo! - What, what? - [Unintelligible louder] Oo-oo-oo-oo! - I don't get it, what are you saying?! - I'm telling you that I won't let go! [Alarming music] - Oh! What's going on? Where are the little hares? - [Crying] Wolf carried off the little hares! [Merry holiday music] - What happened, Hare? Why are you all crying? - [Crying] Wolf... took our little hares! - Alarm! Alarm across the whole forest! Wolf carried off the little hares! - [Singing] Alarm! Alarm! Wolf carried off the little hares! - [Singing] Alarm! Alarm! Wolf carried off the little hares! - [Singing] Alarm! Alarm! Wolf carried off the little hares! - You haven't forgotten our deal? One little hare for me! Now nobody will be able to find us! [Laughs] - There are no tracks left... - Ah, look, look! - If it isn't our car! But where is the snowman? - I... I'm here, boss! - [Singing] Alarm! Alarm! Wolf carried off the little hares! - [Screams] Wolf, return the little hares! Wolf, return the little hares! - [Gasps] They'll catch up to us soon! [Cries loudly] - What? What's with you? - Ah, my dears! How sorry I am for you! This was all the evil wolf's idea! - But you suggested it yourself! - I didn't suggest anything to you! I'm naive! I'm gullible! I'm easily fooled! [Crying] Wolf: - Don't be so loud! - [Loud cries] Oh, I won't forgive you for this! I'm so... The most important thing is to get away in time! [Laughs] Oh! - Aha! Gotcha, Crow! - Help! Oh! Ah! Oh! - Excuse me, but where's my nose? Where is my carrot? - She ate the snowman's nose! - Well, let's not take things from a child! - Here's a new nose for you! Everyone in the car! - But where's my sweet daughter? What a restless child! - Take it easy! She probably fell asleep in the car! - Where shall we? Where to look for Wolf? - Grandpa Frost! Grandpa Frost, look what I found there! - I'm a cunning old wolf! [Laughs] I've outsmarted everyone! - Here, here! - Wolf ran over there! - I see the wolf! [Fast music] - I give up! I'm guilty! Here's the coat, Here are the felt boots, Grandpa Frost: - Return the little hares, Wolf! - Of course, of course! Here - all safe and sound! And I'm guilty! Guilty-y-y? - Daddy, Daddy! - Mom! Hare: - [laughs] My dear sons! [Kisses] My little hares! [Song] "Hear that? As always, riding through the wood In the New Year's quiet winter evening Grey-haired Grandpa Frost with his white beard - Let us go together to meet him! Once again, the New Year approaches our home With snowy noiseless steps, Soon, here and there, fir trees will alight With colorful bright lights! [Fireworks, fun music] - Hello, dear children! - Happy New Year! [Fireworks, fun music] - Happy New Year! Happy New Year!
