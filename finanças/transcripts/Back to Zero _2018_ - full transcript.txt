¶ What a perfect day ¶ ¶ Kindly chase my cares away ¶ ¶ If you ask me, I gotta say ¶ ¶ I'm doin' fine ¶ ¶ Got my baby ¶ ¶ Smilin' next to me ¶ ¶ Takin' my breath away ¶ ¶ With her big, brown eyes ¶ ¶ And we're groovin', groovin' ¶ ¶ To the song on the radio, song on the radio ¶ ¶ Always singin' soft and low ¶ ¶ Fits the mood just right ¶ ¶ It doesn't get better than this, no ¶ ¶ Nothin' can bring me down ¶ ¶ I shove all my regrets, lovin' ¶ ¶ To the freedom I have found ¶ Let me tell you a little story about a man named Henry Thorton. Some call him Hank. There he is. Or I should say me, driving to work. I look pretty content for a guy with an urn full of ashes behind him. You might even say happy. Happy 'cause this was the last day I had to be in this stinking town working for a piece of shit boss, doing fucked up things I hated. My job? How do I explain? Look, see, my boss has girls who need to be taken places. Ladies who are, how should I say, in the adult entertainment business. These ladies need protection, a little financial management, some guidance when they stray, muscle when if needed, the occasionally sympathetic ear. I provide all those services. For this, I get a little taste of the action, which all goes towards paying off my boss. Sounds pretty simple, huh? Not so much. Somehow, Hank find a way to fuck things up royally and end up more in debt. I was determined not to let that happen, today, of all days. ¶ I'm doin' fine. ¶ ¶ I am doin' fine ¶ ¶ I am doing so-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh fine ¶ ¶ Yeah, fine ¶ Jimmy Costello, aka the Fatman. A refugee from the New Orleans mafia. His uncle came out here a few years later and they started up the family business, first working the docks, they moved onto prostitution, gambling, you know, typical guinea shit. You go to a rub and tug anywhere in the city, chances are one of the young Asian ladies giving you a happy ending owes Jimmy for getting her into the country. Know this, Jimmy's not someone you want to owe. - It's the chauffer. - Nice to see you too, Fawn. - The nights sitting in the car, staring at the back of your stupid head, weren't exactly my greatest remembrances. - Hey, hey, hey, play nice you two. Hey sweet cheeks, go make me a drink? Do you want one? - I'm driving. Your girls. Girls I'm responsible for. - Bump then? - I'm good. - Ladies. - Excuse me? - You're driving ladies, not girls. Remember that. One Singapore Sling, comin' up. - Sit down. The last night in the big city for ya. We got a new guy, we want you to give you a little orientation to. Kind of show him the ropes, as it were. - That depends. - Hank. You owe me, and while you owe me, you do what I say. - Who is this new guy? - Charlie! Come on, get out here. - I think he's taking a shit in there. Who takes a shit at somebody else's house? That's just rude. Give daddy a massage. Oh, there he is. - Sorry boss. Oh. Don't say it. - I told ya so? Wouldn't think of it. - Thanks. - Charlie, my boy. Hank here is gonna show you the ropes. You were good at what you did. He's the best at what he does. - Not a problem. - Okay, I got an easy night for you two. Gives him enough time to how the particulars of the new position, right? - So what's up for tonight? - You drive Mindy and Simone around. - The new driver, what's up with him? Oh, yeah, him. Yeah, he got a little familiar with Fawn here. Yeah, take your glasses off. - Whoa. - So I had to give her a tune up. That's employee fraternization. I look down on that. In other words, bumping uglies. Bad for business. - Got it, so we're taking a couple of girls around town. Sounds easy enough. Let's rock and roll. You comin'? - I'll see you in the car. Is this the guy you're sticking me with on my last night? - Yeah, I think he's gonna do some good things. You teach him how to get a little dirty. Besides, I got something else I want you to do also. - And what's that? - Hm, Mindy. Sweet Mindy. I'm thinking about putting her into the inner circle, so I want you to pick her up and bring her back here by the morning. - Does she know this? - What the fuck? - Nice attitude, I'm doing this for you. Think you'd appreciate it. You're the one who says that you can't keep up, that I'm too much for you, that I gotta bring in the second shift. - Too much? - Yeah. He pops boner pills like they're candy. - Boner pills and cocaine, there's nothing better. - You know, she's just a kid. - Hey, do you want another slap? You bring her to me. And when you're done, tomorrow, you're done for good. You good with that? - Yeah, I'm good with that. Charlie "Don't call me Chuckie" Tildon. Decent enough guy. Ran an underground casino that catered to the movers and shakers on the posh side of town. Word is, some of his success as an earner was from rigging a couple of the games. Unfortunately for Charlie, he cheated the wrong man and Jimmy had to make it right. Make Jimmy a million, not a pat on the back. Cost Jimmy a dime, you get a foot up the ass, if you're lucky. How much you owe the boss? - I should be square in a couple months. Then I'll get my casino back. - Chances are that won't happen nearly as soon as you're thinkin'. This town has a way of trippin' you up. - Come on. How hard can this job be? Sorry Hank, this aint rocket surgery. I'm an earner, trust me, my friend. - I don't doubt that. Sometimes you rack up that faster than the money comes in. Let's just say I've screwed up some during my time with the Fatman. - Oh, well that sucks for you. - This, this is what we call home base. This bar is one of many businesses Jimmy owns a little piece of. It also happens to sit right in the middle of Jimmy's world. Picks up, drops off, waiting for a girl, we can do it all here. Right now I have to pick up some player money. - And here's your Cosmopolitan. Just a little heads up, Cosmos are really bad for your vagina. - So here's the deal. She doesn't stay down there very long. You know, oral like stuff. - Okay, you want a bit of advice? Here it goes. First off, return the favor. Do you go down on her? - Um. Yes. - Do you get the job done? - I think so. - That's a big no. Get down there and at least get her engine running. Better yet, stay down there until she gets her cookie. - Cookie? - Orgasm, you dumbass. Second secret to getting your girl to stay down there: wash your stinky ass. Nothing ruins the mood like the wafting smell of an unwashed ass. - Words of wisdom, all for the price of a drink. - Oh, uh, hello Hank. I was just gonna call you. - What day is it? - Huh? - What day is it? Simple question. - Saturday. - Exactly. Now what day did you say you had my money? - Tuesday. Which Tuesday? Excuse me? - Another simple question. Which Tuesday? Next Tuesday, Tuesday three weeks from now? Which Tuesday? - Last Tuesday. - Exactly. Now I didn't get my money last Tuesday. So where is it? - Look. I don't have it. I'm tapped out. Sorry to hear that my man, very sorry. - We're gonna rough him up? - Look at me. - If you're gonna hit me, please, not the face. - My wife might-- - Oh, yes. Your lovely wife Patricia. - Patricia. Is that the one that doesn't get the cookie? - Now you're threatening my wife? She has nothing to do with this. Why would you hurt her? - Hurt your wife? What kind of man do you think I am? Your wife seems like a lovely, lovely woman. Why on Earth would you say something like that? The woman who takes care of your beautiful home at 22 Cedar Lane. The woman who drives your adorable child to the monastery school on Chestnut on her way to volunteer at the Furry Friends Animal Shelter downtown. No. You have my word, I would never lay a finger on her. - Thank you. - I do have to ask myself why a woman who is obviously way out of your league would be with a degenerate like you. - I don't think she knows what kind of man he is besides an inconsiderate lover. - I think you may be right. So here's what I will do. I guess I'll drop by your beautiful home on Cedar Street or Furry Friends, and let her know that her husband is a degenerate gambler who lost his daughter's college fund and then some. We got a couple errands to run. I'll be back here in about two hours. Have my money for me, or a blowjob will be the least of your concerns when you go home. - Okay. - Go. - Interesting. - I guarantee he'll get my money for me. That man is what I like to call, properly motivated. Lesson number two. I'll see you in a bit. One more minute! - Lesson number three, know your girls. Simone here is always at least a half hour late for everything, so if you wanna get her to a date on time, plan accordingly. - Wouldn't want her to be late for their, uh. - Have some class, man, these girls don't suck dick. Strippers. - Exotic dancer. You talk shit about either of these ladies again, and your head will go through the nearest wall. - Noted. Mindy and Simone. Simone and Mindy. Can't say one's name without the other. Two ladies who are unfortunate enough to be in Jimmy's debt. If there's a silver lining to this shit show I call my life. It's them. - Hey. - Hey. What's that? - It's called a dream catcher. This is something that my people use to keep their bad dreams away. - Dream catchers are made by the French? - I'm 1/64th Cherokee. On my father's side. This is something that I give to the people I love so that they can stop having nightmares. - That's so sweet. I love you, too. - Come on girls, let's go. - All right. I'm here. - So, how you been? - How excited are you huh? One more night and you'll never have to babysit one of Jimmy's girls again. - Mindy. Mindy, let's go. - You don't tell me what to do. I tell you. - Save it for the customer. Hm. Cute. Come on guys. Chop, chop. Funny how a smell can bring back a flood of memories. I don't know what it is, but this place smells like a candle shop at the mall. Every time I walk past one, I think of her. - So what, are you just gonna stand there? Or are you gonna come in? Beer? - Kitchen. ¶ Brought me love that wasn't true ¶ ¶ Blame your arrows, blame your aim ¶ ¶ Blame the moonshine and the rain, blame ¶ It's his father. - Ugh, creepy. - What the hell you doin'? - Just looking. - You've got issues girl. ¶ I said I want you but I cannot say when ¶ - Are you sure it's your father? - Of course he's sure it's his father. What kind of question is that? Who else would it be? - Just wondering. I heard this story about this pet cemetery and they would take all the cats and dogs and put them in the incinerator at one time and then scoop it up and make the ashes for their owner. You know, like half a scoop for a cat, three for a scoop for a dog. A bunch of scoops for a big dog. True story. I'm sure it's him. - You know, you might wanna get it checked. - Just, you know, to be sure. - So, what's the plan for tonight? - Uh, easy night so far. Mindy you have Phil for an hour, and Bradford booked you for three hours, maybe more. Brad must like you. - And Simone, you have a bachelor party in a couple hours. - And I'm here now, why? - Hank don't make two trips. You can wait with Charlie and me while Mindy does her think with Phil. - Phil'll be quick. He has a feet thing. Mostly just clipping my toenails. I think he keeps them. - What does he do with them? Make soup? - Fuck if I know. - Quick question, how old are you? 21. You seem older. - How old do I look? Not so much look, more like act. - I'm sure there's a compliment in there somewhere. - Totally. - Eight letters, first letter P, Italian cheese. - Parmigiano, woman, mama mia. - Be nice. Pecorino. Parmigiano has 10 letters. If you wanna get all Italian about it, it's Parmigiano-Reggiano. This is the guy you are leaving me with? - Astonishing. Big brains and big boobs. - Last time. Have some respect there, Chuckie. - Don't call me Chuckie. - Let's treat this as a learning experience. Now, you took a look at Simone here and you made certain assumptions. You never jump to conclusions. You assume things of people and bad things can happen. Now, she just made you look like, putting it as delicately as I can, a dumbass. You were painfully wrong. One day you might be in a situation where you might think the person you're dealing with is soft, not to be taken seriously. And instead of being made to look the fool like you just were, you could be dead. So next lesson, take everyone seriously until they prove otherwise. - I don't need your lessons, I-- - Yeah, you do. And for mine and Mindy's sake, listen to him. Your stupidity could get us hurt. Or something worse. - Can I finish? I'm a serious man, and I have big plans. I have plans for my plans, and plans for my planning, if you will. So I will get back my little casino, and when I do, someday, after it's all said and done, I will own this town. - Big plan man. Listen to your Uncle Hank and he'll tell you a little something about plans. They're just something to get you into shits when dealin' with the boss man. Lesson number five, keep your eyes open, do your time, pay off whatever it is you owe the Fatman, and get your ass out of town when you're square. - Yeah. Just pay your debts and leave. - Nine letters, South African antelope, last letter K. - Pronghorn. - Nice try, but yet again, wrong. Pronghorn does have nine letters, but American, and not technically an antelope. There's no K. Springbok. The word you're looking for is springbok. Maybe you should try the celeb weekly crossword. It might be more your speed. Sorry. - Now you be nice. He's not coming. I knew we should have broken a finger or something. - You want to make a bigger wager? - Maybe. Oh, and I would have lost even more money. - And the Vig? - You didn't say anything about interest. Now, get home to your lovely family and seriously reconsider your life choices. - Lesson learned. - If you wanna stay in the game, breaking legs and fingers is a sure way to get yourself busted. Know this, gambler fears two things: not being able to bet and the lady in his life knowing exactly how much he lays down. - So how much? - Enough. Time to go get Mindy-poo. ¶ I made a list of ¶ ¶ What makes mister love love ¶ ¶ If I had enough ¶ - No disrespect there, Hank, but this really creeps me out. Can we put your dad in the trunk? - You'll go in the trunk first. - Whatever. Why is he here anyway? - He's leaving. - Tonight? - Isn't that right Hank? - How was Phil? - What a freak. - If it weren't for freaks, we wouldn't be in business. - I know, I know. But there are freaks, and then there are freaks. You know what this guy wanted me to do? He wanted me to piss on his feet. - Did you do it? - He paid me a lot. - Speaking of money, cough it up. Piss money, too. - Come on Hank, I peed on someone. I deserve this money. - We'll let the Fatman decide how much you get. It's not my call to make. - Jerk face. - Lesson number six, some girls will hold money back. Even sweet ones like Mindy-poo. - Sweet. She seems like a little badass as far as I can tell. - Oh, you don't even know. I'll drop Mindy off at Bradford's and then you at the bachelor party. You want me to come up? ¶ How my love is smokin' ¶ ¶ Hotter than the sun ¶ Some guys hire a stripper for their bachelor party thinking they're really getting a hooker. They have visions of some kind of tag team gang bang at the end of the night. My job is to let them know just what's what. I always say, an ounce of threat is worth a pound of whoop ass. - Not fucking her. No way I wanna end up with a drippy dick on my honeymoon. - Buddy, you gotta do it. Be in a gang bang. Cross it off your bucket list, check. - How about I watch a gang bang? - If you watch, it aint a gang bang, okay? You need five. - No, four's enough. - No dude, you need at least five. - You know, he's right. You have your solo sex acts, twosome, threesome, foursome, five or more, that's a gang bang. - No. I'm pretty sure it depends on the ratio of guys to girls. Like if you got three guys, one girl, that's a gang bang. Two couples, that's a foursome. - Three guys, one girl, that's tag a team. - Fuck balls, stop it. Not gonna be in a gang bang. End of story. Fini. - Do you mind if I fuck her? - How hot is she? - Dude, she is crazy hot. She looks like your sister. - You got me stripper that looks like Erin? - No, no, no, no, no, that would be totally, totally weird. We got you a stripper that looks like your sister Shelly. - Shelly's hot. - No. - Huge boobs, man. - No. No, not the point. What is wrong with you? No. Guys, this was my night. You're supposed to get a stripper I like, maybe one that looks like your sister. We need a new girl. - You are ruining this party for me. - Come on, this is my fuckin' night. - Nobody cares. Show biz. - Okay, gentlemen, first things first. Cash, who's got it? - They said you take plastic? - Seriously? - That's what they told me on the phone. - Lesson number seven, we take credit cards. Okay, gentlemen. Now do you know what you just paid entitles you to? A couple hours of her company. You want dancing and skin, well then you need to tip. Understand, gentlemen? - Understand? Yes. - Yeah, sure. - What it does not entitle you to is fucking, blowjobs, handjobs, rimjobs. No jobs at all. None of that. You want a hooker? Then you need to make another call. Any disrespect to this lady, and you'll be gettin' a serious visit from us. Get me? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Now gentlemen, I give you the lovely Crystal. - Which one of you lucky boys is my bachelor? Hello. - All right, I'll leave you to it. Have fun. And first and foremost, be respectful. Lesson number eight, I hope you're paying attention. - Hm? - All right boys, music please. - Yeah. Here we go. ¶ Damn his eyes, damn his casual goodbyes ¶ ¶ And each shot of heaven is worth the pain ¶ ¶ And every fallen angel ¶ Goddamn, get the door woman. - Okay, okay, I'll answer the door. I always answer the door. Who is it? - Hank and some funny looking guy. Okay. He's not so funny looking huh? - Funny looking to me. - What's for dinner, Sergei? - Sergei loves the Italian food, so good. But no dinner, just a little snack. A little bruschetta, some tomatoes and pepper. Mozzarella and bufala. Perfection. - You ever try that, uh, pecorini? That's some nice Italian cheese. - Who is this man you bring into my house, talking cheese to Sergei? - This is my replacement, Charlie. But you can call him Chuck. - Don't. - My new friend Chuck E. Cheese. It is called pecorino, and it is too dry for caprese salad and Sergei likes his cheese moist. You like, trust Sergei. Good huh? Like an 18 year old pussy. - Hope Sergei likes a taste of cheese better than Sergei likes a taste of pussy. Why you talk to me like that? - You know I'm right. - One day. One day, I swear. Is good huh? Yes. - We have to talk. - Okay. You two talk, we go drink. Okay. What does Hank want to talk to Sergei about? - I want you to meet my replacement, and ask a favor. - If Sergei can do it, he will. - I'm leaving. In the morning, out of town, for good. I want you to do what you can to make sure Simone and Mindy are okay. - I'll do what I can, but why me, why not you? - Eh, I'm goin'. And my options are limited. - What about my new friend Charlie? He can take care of them, no? - He has a hard enough time taking care of himself. - I'm right here. It's a little back up. Trust me, you'll need it. - You know, they should come work for Sergei. You. You should come work for Sergei. At Maycomb Shore Company, we make good team. Ask Electra. Everyone loves to work for Sergei, huh? - Tastes nothing like pussy. - You woman, I said moist! So? - Be in debt with your boss? Not much of an option. - You pick your own devil, my friend, you pick your own devil. If you come with me back in the day, we own the town by now. - Not my thing. - I will do what I can to take care of your women, but first we drink. Cheers. Chin, chin, motherfuckers. Tell you a little story. My dad was a security guard at a factory and one day he stopped the janitor leaving the building, pushing a wheelbarrow filled with boxes. My dad checks all the boxes carefully, one by one, to make sure that they're empty. Finds nothing. Every day at five, the same janitor leaves the factory with a wheelbarrow filled with boxes. Dad checks them all, still nothing. Convinced something was hinky, dad came up with a plan to solve the mystery. My dad casually invites the janitor out for drinks, his treat. They start doing shots of Wild Turkey, gets the janitor good and wasted. They talk shit about the company. After an hour trading stories about the dumbasses that run the factory, my dad casually asks him, "Hey, I know you're stealing something, and I gotta know. "Just between you and me, what is it?" The janitor smiles, leans in, and whispers one word in my dad's ear. "Wheelbarrows." - I gotta say, Sergei seems like a stand up guy. - He's a good guy. One of the few men I trust in this town. But his boss is bad news. Sometimes he, like me, had to do things he might not wanna do. But has to, 'cause his boss orders it. That means puttin' a bullet in your head, chances are it'll happen. - You know, you gotta ask yourself one question: if you're so concerned with these ladies, why the hell are you leaving them? - You'll understand one day. - What the hell does that mean? - She should be down by now, try her again. - Still, straight to voicemail. - Eh, that aint right. - Whoa. You got one of those for me. - This guy Bradford is a regular of Mindy's. He's soft. Who knows who's up there, come on. Brad, buddy? Open the door. Time's up. You wanna add on, you gotta clear it with me first. - What the fuck? - Anyone here? No. - Keys. Where's Mindy? She do this to you? - Yes and no. - Yes and no? - Well she tied me up and then he beat me up. - Who? - Some Russian piece of crap that took Mindy. - How do you know he was Russian? - Uh, he, he sounded Russian. - Tell me what happened. - I can do you one better. I can show you. - Show us? - Just don't hit me. It's over here. Ah. What the hell? You said you weren't gonna hit me. - No, I didn't. And you had it comin'. - What's on the card? She knew I was using a camera. I paid extra. A lot extra. I like it over there behind the plant because it looks like something that was shot on the sly. It adds to the sexiness. - Now that's just sad. You know it's gonna be an extra dime. Yeah, I'm good for it. - Money. Now, cupcake. - Good? - All right there little man. Let's see if you can follow simple commands. Strip. Show me what you bought. - Uh, wait, wait, wait. - Wait? - Ah. Armageddon? - What now Bradford? Too much? - Just no marks where my suit won't cover. Investment bankers they won't, you know, understand. - Okay, got it. All right, it's about to get real. Show me what you bought. Strip! I said sexy but this is interesting. You know, my grandmother used to have one just like that. Did you go into her closet and steal it? - No. - No what? - I, I did just what you commanded. I went to the store, I told the sales lady that it was for me. - I think you're a liar. I think you're a dirty thief and you went to some poor old lady's closet and stole it. You deserve punishment. Bend over. - Thank you, mistress, may I have another? - This is not some frat house. You don't speak unless I tell you to. Got it? Oop. Speak. - May I seek them, mistress? - See what? - Them. - You mean these? - Yes, may I see them, mistress? - If you can't call them tits, how in the world do you think you're gonna be man enough to see them? - May I see your tits, mistress? - And who said you call my beautiful breasts tits? - May I see your breasts? - Yes. You may see them. But it's gonna cost you. - How much? I'll pay anything. - I don't want your money. - What then, mistress? - Your pain. I want your pain. And wipe that stupid smirk off of your face. Are you ready? - Yes mistress, I am so ready. - We're gonna play a little game. If you can take the pain, I might let you see. Make a peep, and no breasts for you. Got it? - Yes, mistress. - Does that hurt? You might wanna open your eyes there cupcake. - Armageddon, Armageddon. - Oh, so close. Maybe next time. How's your balls? Huh? - Hey. - You shut your mouth, girly man. You come with me. Sergei. - I'm confused. - Sergei, I think that's one of his guys. - Your buddy? - Had to be his boss's call. - I'm calling the cops. - You don't wanna do that. - I'm fucked. Simone. - Hey! - I'm borrowing this. Don't call anybody, don't leave this room. Wait for us to get in touch. Got me? Got him? - Try again. - It's gone to voicemail three times, she's not picking up. - Seven years, and you'd think I'd have learned my lesson. But here I am again, facing the possibility of a couple more years of servitude to the Fatman. First things first, get Simone. ¶ I don't remember why, I wanted you for mine ¶ ¶ You're not the keepin' kind ¶ ¶ You're not the keepin' kind ¶ What the fuck Simone? - What? I could say the same to you. You were supposed to pick me up an hour ago. But look, I made myself some more money. And you know, Jimmy doesn't get any of this. This is all mine. - Why is everyone naked? - Well we were playing poker, but I took all their money, so then we decided to play strip poker and, well these guys really suck at poker. - We've been trying to get a hold of you for the last half hour. - Oh. I forgot to turn my ringer on my phone on. Oops. - Oops? - Yeah, oops, like, I acknowledge my mistake. I really don't feel like it's that big of a deal. - Trust me, it's a big deal. Let's go. - Come on man, give us a chance to win our money back. - Oh honey, it's not your money, it's mine. - Dude, take it easy. - Do I look like someone it's a good idea to call dude? - Hank. - Sorry, dude. - I said let's go. We have a little situation, we need to get you somewhere safe. - We've gotta go. Cool party. - The Russians have Mindy? - Ukrainians. - What's the difference? - Sergei's Ukrainian. Ukrainians are like Russians on crack, not people you wanna mess with. The question is what to do. - We can always tell Jimmy. It's not like it was really our fault. - He doesn't care about that stuff. Let me tell you a little story about me and Mindy. See, we're in the shits with Jimmy through no fault of our own. Well we were told that we could make an easy grand if we went down to the docks and picked up a package and delivered it. Well no one told us that that package was going to be a 16 year old girl from Thailand. Well we picked her up, got her in a car. When we got on the Harbor Freeway, I looked in the mirror, and I realized something was wrong. So through a very scary translation on my app on my phone, we realized that this girl had no idea what was going on. She thought she was here to meet her uncle. Jimmy was gonna put her in one of those massage houses to work out her debt. Mindy and I, we made the executive decision. We dropped her off at her uncles. They disappeared, and we took the debt. - Hold on, how in the world is that not your fault? You had a package to deliver, you did not deliver. Totally your fault. - Are you not listening? It was a little girl. - I'm not saying what she did was wrong, but her saying she's in the shits is not her fault, she made a choice to save some person, knowing full well what the consequence would be. - Do you have any idea how close you are to being punched in the face right now? What do you have some sort bizarre form of Tourette's or something? - Something happened. I'm gonna go visit my friend Sergei and hope he's not behind it. - Oh he's behind it, all right. Russian, Ukrainian, whatever, he did it. Now I'm ready to go kick some Ukrainian ass, are you? - No. You two will sit your asses in the car. - So I get to miss the gun play? - I go in guns blazin', no way Mindy makes it out. I'll check out his place, find a way to slip in. If she's there, and get her out. Did you want cream? - No, I like it black. - Another thing we have in common. - Mm. Thank you, it's good. - So. That just happened. Twice. - Now what? - Third time's the charm. Seriously, we have to be smart here. We can't let the Fatman know. - Right. Rule number two, no fraternization between employees. - Employees. More like indentured servants. You know my ancestor that first emigrated to this country as an indentured servant. He was in debtor's prison in England and they put him on a ship way back in the 1700s. Sent him to the new world to pay off his debt working on whaling ships. - That's really interesting. - When he arrived in America, as soon as he saw the coast just north of Portsmouth, he jumped overboard, swam to freedom. Did they ever find him? - Nope. Disappeared into the woods in Maine and eventually settled close to the border of Quebec. Got married, had nine kids. The thing is, I thought about him, a lot over the last few years. Took big balls to jump off that ship. So many bad things could've happened. Drowned, caught, killed. But he took the leap anyway. - So, are you saying that being with me is like jumping into shark infested waters? - No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying at all. But, I'm, we, we're indentured servants in a way like him. Like those Asians the Fatman smuggles into the port. We're stuck. We're doing what Jimmy says, when Jimmy says. - But what's our alternative? - Well haven't you been listening? We jump. - Just? - Leave. Or stay here. - Hank. I have more to think about here than just me. - It's only a matter a time before Jimmy wants to turn you or Mindy out. I mean, there's a reason he gave you two a pass and let one of his girls go. As long as Mindy is here, I am here. - Hello there Hank. Thanks for keeping me up all night. So? What are you two talking about? - You know, stuff. - Stuff huh? You know what I wanna talk about? What? - A puppy. I think we should get a puppy. Because, you know, we're gonna be here for a while. Might as well make this place our little home. - Puppy? - Yes, a puppy. What do you think Simone? - Why not a goldfish? - No, no, not a goldfish, a puppy. A puppy means you plan on being there for a long, long time. It's a commitment. A goldfish? A goldfish is just gonna die in a couple of months. You flush it down the toilet, and then you forget about it. We'll talk about it. - Beautiful. Beautiful. Gorgeous, Sergei loves it. My little tiger, you look stunning. Place this over here. - So your friend is the agent? - Would Sergei like you? - Like a rug. - Wait a minute. You can come in now. - Visitors? Now? - Come on in my friend. Sergei sees you are lurking. Hey. - Why the gun? - Looking for someone. - These two? Bring them. - Get in there. Hey boss. This funny looking one aint so stealthy. - Thanks. - What part of wait in the car did you not get? - You were taking forever. - Sergei thought you were a peeper trying to wait for Electra to show her tits. - You didn't say the agent wanted nudes. - He didn't, Sergei did, it's okay. These two not who you are looking for? Who then? - Mindy. - Mindy, sweet little Mindy. Sergei loves Mindy. - That's why we thought we'd find her here. That plus the video we have of your guy snatching her. - Hank. Put the gun away. You make Sergei nervous. - Sorry, forgot I had it. - Show me video. - It's all right here. - That's a copy. - We go look at video. Hey, computer, now. - Yes, boss. - So you're a model, huh? - What makes you say that? - I'm a photographer. Just a hobby, but, you know, you never know. - Maybe we can work together? Yeah? I don't think so. - Are you ever not a tool? - Gun runner, chef, photographer. - Sergei is a renaissance man, what can I say? - Sorry boss, uh, keys might be a little sticky, huh? Ew. - Let's look at video. You shut your mouth, girly man. - See? Right there. There's the Ukrainian guy. Your guy. - No Ukrainian. - Russian? - No Russian. The short guy's Azerbaijan and this piece of shit is from Azerbaijan. - How can you tell? - Accent. No Russian, no Ukrainian. - It all sounds the same. - That's racist. - No. No, it's not. - You sound little bit racist. You see what you think is a Russian accent. What you don't see is what's really going on, you hate Russian people. Look again. Tell Sergei, what is really going on? - What do you see? - Fuckin' wheelbarrow. - What? - That little fuckin' shit. - Who? - Bradford. Look. When the Azerbaijaner, bajainian, the guy, hits him, there's an orange tip on the gun. It's a fake gun. Look at the end. - Someone turned off the camera. - Exactly. When we found our buddy Brad, he was still tied up. How could the video have turned off on its own? - I told you, Sergei didn't do it. But that man has her, or knows where she is. - And now we're right back where we started. You know where this guy is? - Sergei will make few calls. - Let's go visit Bradford. - Let me get your number. Next time I have a photo shoot, I can use you as my model. - Oh. Funny looking man. I will have to say no. Charlie, let's go, now. - Bitch. - Dick. - Do we have Bradford's number? Yeah. - I should get this. - All right. - Yeah, boss? - Is Hank there? - Yes. Is his phone broken? - Not that I know of, sir. - Then why is he not picking up? - I'm not sure about that. Anything I can do? - Yeah, just tell him that thing that we talked about, I definitely want that to happen and not to forget about it. - The thing? - The thing, Mindy. I want her at my place. So take her to her apartment and have her pick up some clothing and have her at my place by 10 o'clock, okay? - Okay. I'll try. - No, no try. You're gonna get here and then we're gonna have some Louis Tres, a cigar, and we're gonna have a good bye with Hank, okay? - Uh, Jimmy? What would happen if she didn't wanna come? Are you serious? Well, I'll tell you what you do: grab her by her hair, drag her to your car, throw her in and tell her, is she has any other problems, that the first time I fuck her is gonna be in her tiny, little ass. So now do your job and stop asking questions that you know the answer to. Son of a bitch, are you kidding me? Brand new on the job and he's already fucking pissing me off. That's bullshit. - Check mate. No it's not. - Yeah it is, look. - Shit! Fuck! - What did Jimmy say? - Well? - He wanted to make sure we were delivering his package. - Package? What package? - Yeah, Hank, what package? - Mindy. - I thought these ladies were special to you. - They are. Hell of a way to show it. It's complicated. - Complicated? - Yeah, right now it's really complicated. You forget that someone has Mindy? It's not really relevant right now what I may or may not have had to do for the Fatman. We need to make sure she's safe, and we can discuss any other plan later. - Seriously fucked up man and I was just starting to believe you were a stand up guy. - I am a stand up guy. Going somewhere? - Uh, I uh, I, I wanted to get out of town. I thought that the Russian might come back. - Brad, Brad, Brad. Where is she? - I don't know. The Russian guy took her. You can ask Sergei. - Sergei, you know Sergei? He knows Sergei. Funny thing, we just spoke with Sergei and he assures us he doesn't have her. And well, since he's a friend, we tend to believe him. - Come on, you saw the video. - Yes, we did. Who turned the camera off? - Who turned the camera off? - Nothing says I'm gonna lie to you like answering a question with a question. Now, before you do something stupid like lie again, think about this very carefully. You took a woman who was very special to a lot of people. She's Simone's best friend, she's my responsibility, and unfortunately, she's my boss's property. So, tell us where the Azerbaijana, or baijanian, what the fuck do you call a guy from Azerbaijan? - Azerbaijani. - Are you sure? - Yeah, she pulled springbok out of her butt, I'd tend to believe her. - Anyway. You will tell us where she is. - You know that I can take a beating. - I don't plan on beating you. I have something really special in store. - A few cuts? I was cutter before cutting was a thing. Go ahead. - Brad, Brad, Brad. I feel like I should tell you a little something about me. Something that you should think about while you decide whether or not you're gonna answer our queries. Now, I am the fourth of four girls. Now, my mom she thought three girls was enough but uh, daddy, Simon Mullins Jr., he convinced her to try one more time for a Simon Mullins the third. As you can see, daddy got a Simone instead of a Simon. - What the hell does this have to do with right here, right now? - Oh, I'm gonna get to that, but, right now you need to listen, and listen well. See, I loved my daddy, and he, he taught me so much, like how to catch a fish, set a snare, to track a deer, and how, getting to my point, how to skin an animal. And I was very good at skinning. Funny story, you know how they say there's more than one way to skin a cat? That is so true. See, first, we have what's called an open skinning. That's where you cut from the asshole, up along the middle of the body, to the chin. Then, out along all four arms and limbs, 'til the wrists and ankles. Now at that point, the skin just peels off. Kind of like a jacket. - Circle of life, hakuna matata, baby. - That means no worries, for the rest of your days. What? You know your cheese and antelope. I know my Disney tunes. - Look at me. - You might wanna do what she says. - See the second type of skinning is called case skinning, and this is where we cut all along the asshole, then up along the back of the legs, down around the ankles. Skin is then peeled off the animal's body, slowly, like a sock. Now, this is where it gets just a little bit weird, but, I remember watching my daddy case skin a muskrat once. - What's a muskrat again? - It's like a little beaver. - Oh yeah. - Anyway, back to my story. I remember my daddy case skinning this muskrat and I couldn't help but wonder, what would it be like to do that to somebody I really, really didn't like. And right now Bradford, I really don't like you. I'm gonna tell you what we're going to do, to show you just how much I need to find my friend. If you don't tell me what I need to know, I'm gonna have these two boys tie you up by your ankles, and I will cut slowly around your puckered little shit hole. Then, I'll cut you from your ass to your ankles and slowly peel the skin off your body. Now I'm gonna guess that you'll peel to right around your knees until you tell me what I wanna know. So save yourself a world of pain, Brad, and tell me, where is Mindy? - She's fucking crazy. - You might not wanna call a woman who has a knife in her hand, threatening to cut around your asshole, crazy. Just a suggestion, Brad. - Get some rope. - Wait, wait, wait, wait I'll tell you. I'll tell you, the Russian. - Azerbaijani. - Whatev-- Ah, the Azerbaijani. He, he, he lives on the other side of downtown. The corner of Kentworth and Vista Grande. - Let's go see the Azerbaijani. That's a nice dream catcher. Where'd you get that? - I don't know. - It's always the quiet ones, just slightly off center. - Let's go. - You know, now that I think about, maybe I should take a cab and go home. Well this could get really crazy and I don't wanna get in the way, so, maybe you could just drop me off on the way. - Whoa, you were just about to skin someone alive and now this is too serious for you? - If you insist. At the very least, we can drop you off at the Azerba-- Azerbaijani's. - You better hope that whoever gave you that dream catcher loves you. - I think she does. - Let's hope so, cupcake. You're leaving? - As soon as I pay the Fatman off. - And you're gone. You've known this the whole time? You sit down. - You can come with me. - Or, you could stay. I still owe Jimmy. If I'm leaving, he's chasing me, he's chasing you. - We get somewhere safe and we call him, make him a deal, pay him back somehow. - It's not about the money with that sick fuck. He likes owning things, Hank, owning people. He owns us. And he is never gonna let either one of us go. - He has to let me go. In a few weeks, I'm square. - I'm not. But if you are so ready for me to leave while I still owe him, why not you? - What? - Leave, why don't you go? Let's just leave, let's go together. Or... - Or what? - Stay. - I can't do that. What? - Either. - You are not a serious man, Hank. Now get the fuck out of my house. Why? - Why what? - Why did you start all this if you knew you were just gonna leave? - Hey there, baby girl. - Did you hear all that? - How could I not? - I'm sorry. - No need. We don't need any stinking men anyway. It's just you and me. You and me against the world. Say it. - It's just you and me, against the world. - And a puppy. - What kind of puppy do you wanna get? - Definitely a rescue. Maybe a puggle. ¶ I swear I didn't do it¶ - Where is she? - She's not here. - Did you check everywhere? - Yes, even under the bed. Which, by the way is disgusting. There's like a hundred used condoms under there. That has to be against some sort of safety health code. - So where is she? - Who? - You know who. The girl. Where's the girl? - Give me your phone. - What? - Give me your fucking phone. What's the password? - Give him the pass code. - Ah. - Relax or I'll break it off. - Nice. Hm. Ana. Eh, there's like five calls to a woman named Ana. Who's Ana? Does she have the girl? - Ana is my mother. - What kind of fool do you think I am? - Well I do not know. What kind of fool are you? - Totally walked into that one. - Who calls their mother by their first name? That's just totally disrespectful, no. I am gonna call this dirty, stinky whore bitch and ask her a few questions. - I would not do that. - Oh really? What are you gonna do? - Me? - Yeah. - Nothing. - Exactly. It's ringing. - I tell you-- - Shut your trap. - You don't want to. - Hello Ana. Nevermind who this is. I have a few questions for your dirty, stinky, poochie ass, ugh. I told Chuck about the dangers of treating a serious man like he's a pussy. Well, what I didn't tell him it's almost as bad to treat a pussy like he's a serious man. Take the Azerbaijani here. He looks serious, he talks serious, like he's hard, someone to be reckoned with. But turns out, he's not a serious man. - I meant absolutely no disrespect. No he's right here, I'm just using his phone. Okay, she wants to talk to you. - Yes, Ana? Oh, no, no, no, no, just these two guys, they're two of my friends. They're just being silly. Yes, yes, Ana. No. No. Yes. Yes, Ana. Ana would like to speak to you again. She insists. - Hello Ana. No. What do you. What do you want me to call you? Gasinov. Yeah, sorry Mrs. Gasinov. Look, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean any disrespect. Sunday? Yes? Okay, see you Sunday. Bye. - You'll see her Sunday? - She invited me to dinner. I was too scared to say no. Your mom is scary. I can't believe you call her Ana. - Ana means mother. Her name is Leila. - Oh. Well, apparently, Leila and you and me and my mother are having dinner on Sunday. She wants to have a word with me. - Okay then, now, back to why we're here. Where is Mindy? - Mindy. You're looking for Mindy. - Yes. Who the fuck do you think we're looking for? - I do not know. You asked me where is the girl. The girl, I do not know the girl. I know Mindy. Mindy is my friend, we go to flea market. - If you guys are such good friends, why did you kidnap her tonight? - No, no, no, no, I did not kidnap her. I come to do her a favor. She said she has new boyfriend who is a little bit, uh, what is word? Kinky. Kinky. Kinky, so her kinky new boyfriend wants to have someone come in and slap him around a little and pretend to kidnap her, take her away, and I said I would do this. Uh, I think it is fun to hit someone, eh-- - Where did you take her? - Nowhere. I come in, I hit him, I yell at him a little. I hit him a few more time. Did I say I like hitting? It's fun. So, then I am grabbing her, we go outside, go out the door, and she's hugging me, thanking me, saying he needs this because he needs it for making up, what is? Ah, he needs to make the wood, the wood. Wood, like he makes... Okay, so yeah, and then we are outside, I go home. Last time I see her was right outside front door. - Sneaky little bitches. - Is Mindy missing? - Not anymore. - So I'll see you Sunday? What should I bring? - Uh. Maybe bottle of wine. Bring red zinfandel. Ana loves zinfandel. - We cool? - Maybe. We'll see. - Hank. - Why? - Look at her, Hank. Look at her. - Believe me, I am. Where are you goin'? Huh, you ready to leave? Stick me with your debt? What the fuck did I ever do to you? I thought we were friends. - Chad was supposed to drive tonight. I figured that if I was gone, Simone could just leave with you. We can't be here, Hank, it's no good. And if I go to the Fatman, I'm gonna end up like all the rest. - So you know. We'll go to Jimmy's, we'll straighten this out. He can be reasoned with. - If you really believe that, then you are a special kind of stupid. - What the fuck else can I do? She's gone, we're all fucked. She's on the run, the rest of us are stuck here even longer. I understand. - Mindy. Baby, put the gun down. Where is he? - Who? - Brad. He said that he was gonna come to take me to the farm. - He's kind of tied up. What? - She has a gun pointed at you. Mindy. Mindy, baby, trust me. If he could be here, he would be. But you're gonna have to put the gun down. Please, Mindy. - He said that we were gonna get married. Have babies. Live off the grid, where Jimmy couldn't find us. He promised. He promised. - Not the first time I've been on the business end of a gun. I may look calm, but let me tell you, I'm about to shit my pants. See, when the person holding the gun is angry, they can be reasoned with, talked down. But someone who is hopeless, despondent, feeling like they have no way out? Well, chances are they will shoot. The trick is to give them hope. Tell me more about the farm. - Yeah, tell us about it. - It was, it was beautiful. In the mountains, with a little cabin. White with green shutters. - Sounds nice. - Were there animals? Tell us about the animals. - There was a barn for horses and chickens. Brad said that we can get a cow and make our own butter. And rabbits, there were gonna be rabbits. - What kind of a cow, huh? Guernsey, Jersey, a Holstein? I would go with a Guernsey, they make way better butter. - A pretty cow. I want a pretty cow. And there were gonna be puppies. He lied. - Bring him in. Yeah, she's going up to the roof. No way down from there. - I'm not going back there, Hank. - Mindy, we can deal with this. - How are we gonna deal with this? We're gonna go live with the Fatman? I don't think so. It's gonna be me doing things too horrible to even think about. My life... My life is over. Done. - Mindy, the gun, give it here. - He's not coming, is he? - I'm here. I'm always gonna be here. Remember? It's just you and me against the world. - It would've been a beautiful thing. I would've been a good mom. I could've taught my babies how to take care of the rabbits and milk the cows. Now it's done. All gone. - We can talk about it just, please, put the gun down. - That's a good girl. You've gotta be fucking kidding me. - Mindy, please, this is not the way. - Listen to Simone. - This is necessary. I'm done. Don't. Trust me. I think you have to let me go. I know this is very selfish, but the first thing that went through my mind when Mindy stepped up on that ledge was a dead Mindy is the same as no Mindy. If she jumps and goes splat on the pavement, I'm still on the hook for her debt. Fuck. I'm a self-centered piece of shit. - Wait. Go. - Mindy, please, baby. - You're here. - What are you doing? - Doing what I have to do. It's the only way. - Talk to her, Bradford. - I love you. Please get off the ledge. We can get through this. - Trust me, sweetie. You're gonna be so much better off. So much better off if I'm gone. - Don't be stupid Hank. - Oh I'm about to get really, really stupid, trust me. - What are you gonna do? Shoot the girl who's about to kill herself? - Please Brad. You deserve better than me. - No I don't. Wait, that, that sounded wrong. What I mean is, I deserve you and you deserve me. We deserve each other. I love you Mindy, with all my heart. - This is either super romantic or super pathetic. Come on. - You love her? - Yes. More than anything. - See? He came for you, he loves you. - Yeah, I totally believe that he's head over heels in love with our girl here. Problem is, I don't hear you saying the same thing. So tell us Mindy, do you love him? - Yes. I love him. - Do you really, really love him? Then get off the fuckin' ledge! - This is-- - Necessary? Oh I get that. See it's necessary for me that you get off the ledge and come with me. - Whoa, shit just got serious. - Please, Hank. Stop. - Then get off the ledge and come with me or I swear to God, I'll blow lover boy's head off his shoulders. - Hank, enough. - It's not nearly enough. Mindy, if you love him, really love him, you'll do exactly like I say. Know this, and believe me like you've never believed anyone before. If you jump, there'll be two dead bodies for me to get rid of. One on the sidewalk, and one on the roof. - You came back for me. - Always. - Okay love birds, time to go. - I will find a way to pay her debt. Please let her go. You can take me instead. - Not really a fair trade there, now is it, Bradford? A man a few years away from his AARP card for a woman in her prime earning years. I don't really see the Fatman going for the swap. - Is everything business? - Bradford, is there really a farm? Let me see a picture. From your phone, do you have a picture on your phone? - It's my wallpaper. - That is a nice farm, isn't it? - Rabbits. Show me a picture of the rabbits. - I don't have any. - No pictures of the rabbits? - No rabbits. I didn't get any rabbits yet. - Well, let me get this straight. You promised our girl here, Mindy, rabbits, and you have no rabbits. - Please. Stop. Right about this time it's pretty much guaranteed that I will do something stupid. Dad, looks like you and me may be in this town a little longer. - Where are we going? - What about the cow? No cows either? - Bradford, no cows either? - No, not yet. - Okay you two, this is what's gonna happen. Bradford, you're gonna marry this woman and take care of her. She will go to the farm and buy rabbits and a couple cows, maybe a dog and a horse, who knows. And keep her safe. - You're just gonna let us go? What about-- - You let me worry about that. And get your ass out of town now, before the shit really hits the fan. I need you to do me a solid, Bradford. - Anything. - I need you to take Simone, too. Get her away from here. You do that, and we're square. - Hank, no. - You want me to let Mindy go? - You know I do. - Then you're gonna go with her. Deal or no deal. - Deal. - One more thing, Mindy. Anything. - When you get to the farm, can you please send me some homemade cheese? Okay? - Okay. - Well it's time to go. Let's hope that wasn't a mistake. - Your only mistake was breaking the Fatman's rules. I knew you two had somethin' goin' on. I knew you were together. I can, uh, leave you guys alone if you like? Or uh, drop you off in a motel, whatever. - Did you really think you could tell me what to do? - A man can try. - Well, now what? - Sounds like the perfect time for a plan. Or maybe a plan for a plan. Told you, I'm a planner. - What to do, what to do? - Well, if we split the debt three ways, it really wouldn't be that bad. - No. No more workin' for the Fatman. - We could work for the Russians. The Ukrainians. Sergei was not the bad, the worst boss. - Or... - Or what? - We have one other option. - Bye bye, daddy. ¶ Little Joey had his insecurities ¶ ¶ Used to fist to keep his women tamed ¶ ¶ Earl, he just sat and cursed missed opportunities ¶ ¶ Looking around for someone else to blame ¶ ¶ Got together on the west coast ¶ ¶ Had 500 bucks a piece said man, let's make a run ¶ ¶ Lost it all to blackjack out in Reno ¶ ¶ God knows they never meant to use that gun ¶ ¶ But that's the makin's of an outlaw ¶ ¶ Just pure bad timing's all it takes ¶ ¶ Being in the wrong place at the wrong time ¶ ¶ Might not be your worst crime ¶ ¶ But it can be your last mistake ¶ ¶ It was just a local mom and pop liquor store ¶ ¶ Old man grabbed a pistol from the till ¶ ¶ Earl yelled old fool why'd you go and do that for ¶ ¶ And he shot to scare and he never meant to kill ¶ ¶ Names and faces in the papers ¶ ¶ They were ridin' hard and keepin' low ¶ ¶ Knew they'd be caught sooner or later ¶ ¶ So they said we're gonna take her ¶ ¶ Just as far as we can go ¶ ¶ But that's the makings of an outlaw ¶ ¶ Just pure timing's all it takes ¶ ¶ Being in the wrong place at the wrong time ¶ ¶ Might not be your worst crime ¶ ¶ But it can be your last mistake ¶ ¶ But it all came to an endin' ¶ ¶ Little bar called Jackson's Hole ¶ ¶ With some redneck bartender ¶ ¶ Didn't like the leathers or the scooters that they rode ¶ ¶ Called the sheriff from the payphone ¶ ¶ One quick description's all it took ¶ ¶ Sheriff, he was young and eager ¶ ¶ Said on this one boys, we're gonna throw away the book ¶
