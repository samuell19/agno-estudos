(dramatic music) (upbeat jazz music) Hey Em, will you turn off that blasted radio? I can't hear myself think. (somber music) Having trouble, mister? Oh, nothing serious. Got overheated a little. I stopped for a spell to give it a rest. Yeah, this weather's tough on everything. A lot of people would rather drive at night when it's hot like this. There's a gas station down the road in Cedar Creek a couple miles, you want me to send a tow truck? Oh, no thanks, I'll manage. Okay, mister, but watch yourself on the road here, the trucks start coming through pretty heavy after sundown. What's the matter, Ed? Is there anything really wrong? Yes there is, everything. Get back in the car, hon, I'll be right back. I'm hungry. All right, we're gonna eat pretty soon. (horn honking) Hey kid. How far's the nearest garage from here? About two miles. What's the trouble? Well the block is cracked. She overheated and split right open on me. Hey, you take me into town? I'll make it worth your while. Well I just saw the sheriff there. He'd have taken you in. Well I guess he could have, but I didn't realize about the block till after he'd gone. How about it? Well, my granny'd be waiting supper. Well I guess I could take you in. Okay, that's fine, I'll get our stuff, and like I said, I'll make it worth your while. Nobody around here will bother it. Okay. Be just a minute. (light jazz music) (man whistling) What's your name, son? Kenny. Kenneth Grimes. That your father's farm you're working? Oh no sir, that's my farm. [Ed] You're kinda young, aren't you? Family live in town? I don't have any family. Except my granny, I live with her. The wages of sin is D. E? Death. The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is life eternal through Jesus Christ our lord. [Emily] I'm hungry, Ed. Can we eat soon? [Ed] Sure, we'll eat pretty soon. Got a dove there, huh? - Yep. - Thank you. Oh, here, got it. All right. Please, I'll take it. Hold it now. Here you go. Mm-mm. Oh, go on, take it. You helped us out. I appreciate it. Well. Thanks. It was no trouble, though. Thanks a lot. Yeah, thanks. I like your wagon. Come on. Let's see now. What kind of a license plate number we gonna put on those two mules? You know, the law says we have to have a number. Yeah, my car's conked out up the road. Number is B48131, Missouri. Oh, you're a show me fella. That's right. Well what happened to the car? Oh, we're gonna have to get it pulled in. Be fixed in a day or so. Trouble, trouble, toil and trouble. Cauldron boil and cauldron bubble. Won't have any difficulty bubbling out there today, will it? No, I guess not. Well, you're not so badly off. The garage is just across the way. Oh, that's good. What cabin you gonna put us in? Oh, this cabin generally costs $6 a day, but since you're having problems, I'm going to make it five. Maybe you'll want to stay around a while. Cabin number 14, it's right across the court. You'll have plenty of time to get settled. Corey Sherman, who runs the garage, is closed for supper. Knowing his appetite, and his father-in-law being out of town, I'd say you could count on an hour, an hour and a half. Right, we'll work it out just fine. Well, thank you, Mr. Wilson. Call on us if we can do anything. I sure will. Thanks. (upbeat jazz music) Well, I see you got here. (mumbling) Yeah, but we'll take care of her. Margery, I don't know how you do it, but every time, your pie tastes better than it did the time before, and that's going some. You know, you folks couldn't have picked a better place to stop, this is the best food in this part of Florida. You headed for Miami? Yeah. Your car's across the street in the garage. No, we had to leave it sitting out in the road. We had more trouble than we thought when you stopped. Oh, well now that's not so good. Did you talk to Corey over at the garage about hauling it in? No, he's not supposed to be back yet. That's right. Since Johnny quit he has no help. Closes up just for supper, he oughta be back about 8:00. We could call him, but I don't suppose that'd do any good. Think so Marge? Corey will be back when he's good and ready and not before. Well, seeing as it's gonna take a little longer than I thought, I think I'd better run out and plant a flare by the car just to be safe. Meanwhile if you do see Corey, tell him to get it off the road as soon as he can. Yeah, thanks a lot. Good night Marge. Night Skinner. [Skinner] See you later. That's too bad about your car. Yeah. Are you comfortable in your cabin? Yeah, thanks. Guess I better try to call this... Sherman, Corey Sherman. You wanna use the phone it's outside. Okay. Thanks. Now honey. Now you wait here. Why can't we wait here, Ed? Listen, just, I have to go outside and make a phone call, about the car, see? And then after I make the phone call, after I make the phone call, I'm gonna come in here and we're gonna get the food, and then we're gonna go back to the cabin and we're gonna be very comfortable there. Okay hon? All right. (upbeat jazz music) # Just kiss her goodbye # # Leave her or else you will cry # # Though she invites you to love her, don't stay # # Walk away # # Walk away # # She'll cling to your heart # # Till she has torn it apart # Hey Margie, look what I found. (mumbling) Come on, give it back, Jake. You bust my kid's hoop, I'll bust you. I'm not gonna bust it, I'm just gonna show you how to use it. Okay, okay, go ahead, throw your spine out, you big clown. But if you break that hoop, I'll fix ya. Hey Marge, look, I'm whirlybird. [Man] Come on, give it back, Jake, huh? Give me one more chance, will ya? [Man] You ain't got the build for it. You ain't got what it takes. # For a petal # # But you come up with a thorn # Man, the things you see when you ain't got a gun. # Kiss her goodbye # # While there is time you must cry # # Make her the memory that you'll always miss # # You must kiss her goodbye # # Make her the memory that you'll always miss # # You must kiss her goodbye # They let me have a turn. Honest, it was nothing. Okay honey, we better get going now. But Ed, don't you wanna see? Later honey. Later. How much do we owe? $2.80. Here you go. Anything else you need, hon? How about a leash. (laughing) Come on. Wait, your order. Yeah. Night. Good night. Hey Marge, how's about some nice roast quail? Yeah, I don't see it on the menu here, Marge. (laughing) (muttering) Well, Alberto, I've seen 'em come with cars and no luggage, but never seen 'em come with luggage and no car. No, I think I'm right. I think they're going to wait until after they eat. Wait? What would they wanna go do that for? Because, my friend, one pleasure traditionally heightens another. Shh, baby, what are you doing here, anyway? I'm checking on you, Pop. But the baby's sound asleep. The baby was sound asleep, lying in the middle of the living room rug. I don't know why I don't go out and hire a nursemaid for both of you. Well I've been looking. I've been checking, haven't I been checking? He's been checking, it's gospel truth. Mm-hmm. He lies and you swear to it. Oh, that's unjust, daughter. Perhaps I'm not welcome. Oh now, sit down, sit down. You old roosters would quit playing I spy out here every time you get the chance. What you fail to appreciate, Margery, is the meaning of the human impulse to speculate. Here we are, after all, marooned in this bucolic backwater, this cyanide of the seaboard, when presto, fate deems fit to reward us with a miracle of pure loveliness. (Marge laughs) The classic and immortal beauty of female pulchritude. Oh, not that the lady is to be compared with Helen. The lady? Oh, Pop. Don't be too literal, daughter. (light jazz music) "Mr. E. Wilson and sister." Just as I thought. Ed. Yeah, hon. Aren't we even gonna say good night to each other, Ed? Yeah, sure. (crying) Oh now, Emily, we're a family, you and I, you know that. (crying) Would you stop walking around with that awful look on your face, and not talking to me, and not looking at me either? I know it's 'cause you're mad. And you don't have any right to be. Because I tried. Honest and truly, Ed, I really, really did. I know, baby, I know you did. Didn't I come right away in the restaurant when you asked me? Yes, honey, you came. We don't have any reason to be mad at all. Oh Ed. It's so pretty here. The ocean's so pretty, and everything's so quiet, and you can hear things, even the people talk like they were whispering in church or something. And you can hear things, like frogs and crickets. All kinds of things. I saw some too. Frogs, I mean. They were hiding by those big leaves. And you can't even see them. And suddenly they jump, like they were gonna jump right in your lap or something. Oh, I forgot. Here, I read this. "You will soon be living near a large body of water, "so prepare for a sudden change that may mean much "to your eventual happiness." See, "be prepared for a sudden change "that may mean much to your eventual happiness." Oh, why not? You said yourself, didn't you, a sign can come from anyplace. Oh, Ed. Let's stay here. Now Emily, which one of us knows what's best? You, Ed, you always know. And what is best? Well first of all, to mind my own business and not attract attention. From anybody? Mm-hmm. But with men especially. Why? 'Cause that's how we always get in trouble, and... And like what happened in the restaurant tonight? The restaurant? But that didn't have anything to do with men. That was just because of the hoop. I wanted to try the hoop. Well you don't think that I wanted to take it away. No, honey. All I know is that something seems to happen time after time after time, it always happens when I'm never around. Come on, now just try and get some rest now, huh? Everything's gonna be all right. Oh Ed. Sometimes I love you so much. [Ed] I gotta go now, I gotta fix the car. Oh, you're not gonna leave me, Ed? Don't leave me. Oh, honey, baby. (light jazz music) You got nothing to worry about now. You got the nightlight on, and the radio's going, and I'll lock the door when I go out. I'll just go to see about fixing the car. Okay? I'll be right back. Anyway, who'd I have to take care of me if I left you? (bird chirping) Wait, now hold it, hold it, hold it. Hold it. This is a sick automobile. Okay, try it now. (engine rumbling) I told you it'd be okay. Wait a minute. (mumbling) (phone ringing) Hello, yes, yes. Oh, Jim, yeah. How are ya? That's right. 55. Uh-huh. Oh, 70? Well. Yeah, uh-huh. What about delivery? Three days? Okay, uh-huh, yeah. Uh-huh. Well I'm much obliged to you, Jim. Yeah. Okay, oh sure. I've got a customer sitting right in front of me. Well. How do you like that, eh? Mr. Sherman, you happen to need a mechanic and I happen to be one who's low on cash, so I was thinking maybe the best thing for us to try to help out each other. Now, I'm willing to stick around here four or five days, I'll take care of the trade while you go out scouting up somebody permanent, and then when the block comes in, I'll install it myself, and I'll pay you for it at cost, and we'll call it a deal. Now how's that, that fair? I don't know. Wait, wait, wait. Let's at least discuss it for a second. After all, how do I know that you are a mechanic? Anybody could've fixed that... (phone ringing) Hello? Where? Yes, yes, yes, put her on. Please. Hello Annabelle? Hi baby. Where you calling from? Annabelle? I thought you were supposed to be home tomorrow. Well, because that house is like a mausoleum. You know, all those empty rooms. Especially the bedroom, if you know what I mean. Listen honey, please try and get home for a spell anyway, would ya? Well sure, honey, I'm glad you won, I'm proud of you, but, after all, you just finished playing at Dallas, and now you want, listen, Annabelle, I know. Sure I'm proud of you, baby, but, hello? Annabelle? Annabelle? (dramatic music) Hello, JC, hi. No, I thought I was still on with Annabelle. Yeah, of course I'm proud of her, yeah. Well, if it means that much to her. I just miss her, that's all. Oh, now JC, now why would I be jealous of my own, well I know how proud you are, yes, you told me. Yeah. Yeah, well, it's just that business is, oh, no, no, no, it's so-so. Yeah, the rents are still coming in. I've got to find a mechanic to replace Johnny quick. Well, matter of fact I do have someone in mind. Yes sir. Oh, and listen, yes. Would you give my love to Annabelle? I mean as soon as she gets settled down in Jacksonville. Yes sir. Hello? Goodbye. Oh, Mr. Wilson, about that proposition of yours, I just think I might see clear to go along with ya. - That's fine, Mr. Sherman, it oughta work out good for both of us. It's a good deal. Let's shake on it. I suppose I'll take the tow truck now and I'll pull in the car and won't have to bother with it tomorrow. Then I'll go back and get some rest and I'll start in bright and early tomorrow morning. Perfect, Wilson, perfect. You'll like it here. There's always room for one more fella, if he knows his trade. Here are the keys to the truck. All right. When you come back, maybe I'll show you a few of the tricks. You do know how to work that tow cable, don't you? Yeah, I think I can figure it out. I'll see you later. (somber music) (insects chirping) (moaning) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (banging) Call the doctor! (chattering) (knocking) [Man] Will you step outside, please? (Emily crying) (Emily screaming) Mr. Wilson, I had to let myself in with the passkey. When she screamed like that, I didn't know what to do. Next time you've got a wildcat to treat, you'd better call a vet. What happened, Doc? If you're here husband, you'd better take care of her. Well, I'd like to hear my sister's side of the story. I just reached out to give her an injection and she clawed me. Well, I'd like to hear her side of the story, I said. I see. Well you'd better go in there and hear it. All right, folks. Go back now to your cabins. Go on, it's all over. Go on. (crying) Leave me alone! Oh, sweetie, please. Oh Ed. Oh please, I love you. (crying) (somber jazz music) Everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be all right. Everything's gonna be all right. I had a terrible dream. All right, honey. We were going someplace, and I wanted to stop and get out. But I couldn't. You wouldn't let me. And then we came to the water, and those big leaves, I jumped out onto one of those big leaves. And the frogs, those frogs. They were twice as big as I was. And the leaves didn't sink for them. Only for me. All right, honey. And they just kept sinking down. (mumbling) And I woke up, and everything was dark, and you weren't there, Ed. You left me. You left me. Oh baby, I'm here now. I'm not gonna go anywhere. Oh Ed, you won't ever leave me, will you? Oh baby, I'm never gonna go away. I'm never gonna go away. (crying) We're gonna stay here like the fortune said. Yeah, baby, we're gonna stay here for a while. We have to stay here for a while. (insects chirping) Hi. Do you have any beer? Do you wanna take it out? No, I'll have it here. Well, okay, maybe I'll have another cup of coffee before I close up. Oh, well no, look, I can just as well take it outside, if that's the case. No, don't be silly, sit down. Well, I... No, it's all right, sit down. Thanks. Is everything all right? Yeah. Everything's fine. You're worried about your sister, aren't you? Yeah, I suppose a little. Has anything like, you know, what happened with Doc Vincent, has anything like that ever happened before? Yeah, a couple years ago. [Marge] What? (sighs) Well, you see, Emily's a full-grown woman, but her mind is that of a six-year-old kid. And without her meaning it, or without her thinking it, or knowing it at all, she just, well, just leads 'em on, and they wanna lay hands on her, and she thinks they're gonna hurt her, and then she turns on 'em, wild. So a couple years ago, about two years ago, this teacher of hers back home, she drove a pair of desk shears through his hands. Actually, through his right hand. And by the time I got there, he'd been to the doctor, but he hadn't been to the police. And he was talking about bringing charges against Emily. Talking about Emily being dangerous. But he didn't, 'cause he was afraid of a scandal. What are you gonna do about this? I don't know. Just gonna get the car fixed and then move on. Just gonna keep moving, that's all. I guess. Good night. (light music) Can I borrow your broom and dust bin thing? Well there, I'm pleased to see you're feeling better this morning. But for a more officious reason than just that. You don't have to clean your own cabin. Why, thorough and daily cleaning of the cabins is one of the standard and outstanding services of this roadside home away from home. Though I must admit, I'm always pleased to see the willing industry of a young homebody. A talent all too rare and difficult to find in this mixed up generation. Thank you, Mister, what's your name? Well, for reasons that escape me at the moment, I'm called Tubbs, Mr. Albert Tubbs, Esquire, at your service. Thank you, Mr. Tubbs. (children chattering) (whistle blowing) (upbeat jazz music) Well, well, look what we have here now. How you gonna score when you can't even get in the game? (laughing) Please stop doing that. Those men are watching you, it's really indecent. Boy, when I say she was built, I mean she was built. I think half of Main Street was just lined up drooling at her. And talk about being top heavy. (whistles) You know, if I wasn't a happily married man, why, oh, who knows, who knows. Well sir, Mr. Wilson, looks like I hired myself something more than a mechanic. You didn't tell me there was a Mrs. Wilson. Very clever. You didn't ask me. Now that you have, there isn't a Mrs. Wilson. Girl happens to be my sister. Well, you can't blame me for trying to judge by looks. Well, I guess her luck is mine then, huh? 'Cause if you had her looks, you wouldn't be working as a mechanic, that's for sure. (somber music) (baby crying) Marge. Marge, the baby, it's missing! The baby? I left him sleeping! Oh, Pop, can't you don't anything right? (suspenseful music) (baby crying) (cooing) Emily. Emily. Emily. Emily, you wanna hand me the baby, Emily? Wait, Emily. Emily. Emily, please. We'll go back to the house and, please Emily. Please Emily, don't hold him over. Just let me have him. Please give me the baby, Emily, please. Just hand him to me, that's all. Just let me have the baby. Let me have the baby. That's a boy. That's a boy. That's the best boy. Okay, all right. (baby crying) No, no, no. No, no. That's the best boy. No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. I got him, I got him. The baby, it was crying. I called and called, but nobody came. So Annabelle, she goes out and she wins down at the riverside. Then her daddy suggests that she ought to try for the regional. And I'll be darned if she doesn't win that one too. So I said to her, honey, look, I'm getting to be a regular golf widower. So she said well, honey, why don't you go and find yourself an outside interest? And I said honey, what I'm interested in, we'd both get arrested if we start doing on the outside. Oh JC, that's her father. He practically built this town. Excuse me. Yes sir, everybody in town knows JC. He's getting old though. Rheumatism, you know. I'll tell you, (mumbling) handling all of his real estate. That's why I'm always on the lookout for a live wire when they come to town, you know? I'm gonna build a resort right here in this town. As far as local talent is concerned, good riddance. Speaking of talent, what did you say that sister of yours was ailing with? I didn't. There must be something the matter with her. A gorgeous creature like that, still living with her brother? I'll be honest with you, Mr. Wilson. One of these days you're liable to get arrested for hoarding. (somber music) Anyway, how about the three of us putting on a feedbag later, huh? As long as I'm practically a golf widower, so to speak, hey. (waves crashing) Hey Emily, who's your housekeeper? Emily? (waves crashing) Hey Em! Hi. Hi. Look at the shells. Hey. There's millions of 'em. Yeah, you really had a good time, huh? There's millions of 'em all over. We need to come down here tomorrow. We'll have a picnic, just the two of us. All right honey, let's go back now, we'll get ourselves a bite to eat, maybe after that we'll go to a picture show, huh? Okay. (somber music) Hi. [Marge] Hi. How'd it go today? Fine. You want anything? Yeah. Cup of coffee. Anything else? No thanks. What's up? Where's your sister tonight? Oh, she's sleeping. We went to the movies and we came back, she was bushed. [Marge] I'll bet. What do you mean? I'll bet she was bushed, I mean. You know she had quite a day today. I'm gonna tell you what happened. This afternoon my baby was found missing from his bassinet. Your little sister had taken him down to the docks. Had him in one of those little rental doreys, and she was holding him over the water, jiggling him up and down, so he could see his reflection. Well, I'm sure she didn't mean... Oh, I don't care whether she meant any harm or not, but the tide in that cove is very treacherous, you see. One big wave could've come along and god knows what. I'm sorry. Well so am I, this thing has got me out of my mind. Look, let me get something straight from you. Maybe this is none of my business, but something is really wrong with her, isn't it? It's just what I told you. No no, I don't mean just what you told me. I mean wrong. Not right. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't... I tell you what, you wait for me, I'll lock up, and I'll walk back with you. Okay. (somber music) Look, I am sorry, I... No, you don't have to be sorry, I understand how you feel. I just couldn't not have said anything. Of course you couldn't. But she wouldn't have done anything, really. She wouldn't hurt anyone. I know if you knew her, she's got more love in her, she never would've hurt your baby. But I know how you feel, and I'm the one that's sorry, I'm sorry it happened. What about your folks, do you have any? No, Mom and Dad died five years ago in an automobile accident. After they died, I put Emily in a foster home. She was all right there for a while. Then she... (sighs) She got to be so lonely. Well, every time I'd come there and visit her, I'd look at her and I'd think, she'd be much better off if I put her someplace where people weren't being paid, showing her love and affection. And so I took her out of there and she's been much better... Are you married? No, but I certainly thought about it. And? Well, I thought that before any woman would wanna take on a situation like this, she'd... Oh, I don't know about that, I married a man I knew couldn't live very long. Don't get me wrong, there was no pity involved, it was just that, well, I loved him very much. We grew up together, so when he asked me to marry him, there was no question what we would do. I guess what I'm trying to say is that when you love somebody like a sister or a husband, or anybody for that matter, when they're in trouble it makes you seem to want to love them all the more. Well, I've lived with trouble all my life. My mom died so long ago, I don't even remember her. Pops tried to be both mother and father to me, but he was only so successful. He's all wound up with this career business, gonna be a big actor. But I love him, I wouldn't want him any other way. Looks to me what your sister needs is to maybe stop running. And maybe you should stop running too. It's getting late, I better be getting in. You must be pretty tired yourself. Good night, Mr. Wilson. The name's Ed. I sure appreciate your taking... That's all right. I'll see you tomorrow. Good night, Ed. Night. Oh. Hey. Aww. Now what's the matter with you? Can't you see where you're going? You're fouling up my lines. Oh. What do you call him? It's not a him, it's a her. Go away. What? Go on, go away. What are you talking about? Hey there, look now, I don't know what you're trying to prove, but that undertow is pretty dangerous. The water's bad. And besides, you're gonna cut your feet on those rocks. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (somber music) (coughing) I told you to watch out. This section of the beach is dangerous. Thanks for helping me out. I was scared. Yeah. It's all right for fishing, but it's bad for anything else. Even the boats have to be careful coming through here. Are you all right now? Yes, I'm all right. Let's go over to my house, and you can dry out there. I want you to meet my granny anyway. All right? Where's Tico? Tico? "Maketh me to lie down in green pastures. "He leads," Kenny! Granny? Who's that with you, son? Granny, this is Emily. You know, the girl I was telling you about. Don't keep going on like a fool, Kenny, what's her name? Emily. I know that, what's her other name? What's your kinfolks' name, girl? Wilson, my brother Ed's my only family. We're staying... Are you saved? Huh? Granny, Emily's not from around here. I don't think she... She ain't answered my question. She saved or ain't she? Saved? Uh-uh, she ain't. When people ain't you can smell it about them. Fire and brimstone, the everlasting fire, glory be to God, Amen. Stretch out your hand, girl, you hear me? Where's her hand? It's just to see what you look like, that's all. That's the way she sees, with her fingers. Well what about it, Granny? Didn't I tell you the truth about her? Kenny, you come in here now and help me get supper. You gonna help me? Don't you go gallivanting off. Kenny! Kenny! You come back here, you hear me? Kenny! Lord have mercy on him. Hi honey. Where you been? Oh, you know Mrs. Carson, don't you? [Marge] Hello Emily. Hello. Where you been? You look like you got a little wet. What happened? Oh, I fell in the water down at the beach. Ed, I went downtown today and I picked out a dress, all by myself. You what? A dress. The lady says when it's fixed it'll look like it was made special for me. Well we'll talk about it a little later. Right now I think we oughta go over and get ready for supper. We're gonna go to the carnival tonight. Yeah, we're gonna go, and Mrs. Carson's gonna go with us. 8:00 be all right? [Marge] 8:00 is fine. Good. See you later. - No, Operator, Mrs. Corey Sherman. C, that's right. Thank you. You're welcome. Don't thank me, please, just... (sighs) Boy. They'll hire anybody these days as long as they'll say thank you. Hello, Annabelle. Oh, hello JC. I mean Dad. Yes, JC, well I wanted to speak to, what? Two under par? (whistles) Well, that's fine. Well I just wondered if I could speak to Annabelle for a few minutes. Yeah. Well, would you have her call me when she gets through? I'm at home. Because business was kind of slack tonight, J-Dad, and I didn't see any, not yet, no. This guy's helping me out, I think if I can persuade him to stay on, uh-huh, yeah, I know, I know. Yeah, JC, I know about that, yes. Tonight? Oh, now J-Dad, I don't think that's necessary for me to get down there just for a couple of trucks, no. I know. I know, I know. I know that, Dad. Yes. Okay, I'll go right on down there, Dad. Oh, you know I will, yes. Okay, but would you tell Annabelle, when she finishes, to have her call me, please, huh? Yeah. Two under par. Okay Dad. Two under par. I make a special dinner for you tonight, Mr. Corey. Anything else I can do? How do I look, Pop? Tell me I look pretty. Come on, Pop, tell me I look pretty. Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee calls back the lovely April of her prime. Except for the earrings. You know some men don't like earrings, Pop? It's true, some men can't stand the sight of earrings. Would you like to hear the piece I'm rehearsing, Marge? What? (sighs) Oh, Pop, just think of it. What was the day before yesterday? Only Monday. I didn't much care if the day came or not. Boy, you never know, Pop, you never know. It's kind of frightening, just supposing his car didn't break down just where it did. You interrupted me, Marge. I did what? I was rehearsing, right in the middle you barged in without the slightest consideration. Oh, Pop, I'm sorry. Well all right, come on now. I'm ready, let's have it. No, it's no use. It's too late now anyway. You wouldn't want to keep Mr. Whosits waiting, would we, on my account? Aww Pop, I said I was sorry, and I am. I'm not sorry about being excited. I'm not sorry about meeting somebody makes me wanna dress up a little bit for a change. How often is it you meet somebody makes you wanna ride on a Ferris wheel? Don't fool yourself, Margery, that's all your Mr. Wilson does mean. Oh, Pop. I suppose you think it's so satisfying looking after you all the time. If there's anything worse than a finicky old woman it's a finicky old man. When am I going out, when am I coming back. Prattling all day long about going on theater tours when you know very well you're never gonna... It's not so! I am going! As soon as I can get the backing. With my name? Name, what name? Fourth-rate summer stock companies and fifth-rate productions? Margery! Pop! You haven't got a name, you never have had and you never will have, and you might just as well face it. Stop. Please. Oh, Pop, I'm sorry I said that, I didn't mean that. Pop. (somber music) Well maybe I won't wear these earrings after all. Pop? (sighs) Got some that aren't so noticeable. (whistling) Where you going, Kenneth? Oh, I'm just going into town to fool around a little. Maybe go to the carnival. Be better off to save the mules. And save yourself. Well I'm not gonna be long. Besides, I'm not gonna take those mules anyway. (carnival music) You mean you don't dream at all? Not even ever? Mm-mm. Well I do, I dream about everything. Like last night I dreamt about frogs. But that was awful. (laughing) What's so awful about frogs? I don't know, it just was, that's all. One time I dreamt about flowers. One time I dreamt about when I was grown up. Hey, what do you mean, when? Now what do you think you're supposed to be now? But Ed says that, anyway, who cares. Let's talk about something else. All right. What do you like best, stuff that tastes sweet or stuff that tastes sour? Food? [Kenny] Yeah. Sweet. Well, I'm gonna get me some razor shells on the beach tomorrow. They're like clams, you have to have a bucket, though. They're kinda sweet. There's a wash bucket I could use. Okay. I'll meet you on the beach at 8:00. That is, if he lets you. Ed? You said I was grown up. All right. Well. Well then. Good night, Emily. Hey son. That was mighty fine of you, son. Mighty thoughtful. Taking her out like that, getting her mind off things for a change. I want you to know that I really and truly appreciate it. Well your sister's no chore, Mr. Wilson, if... Yeah, yeah, I guess she told you the whole thing, huh? I'm supposed to be her brother and we're supposed to be headed for St. Pete to see cement and so forth and so forth. (sighs) Yeah, well, I guess it isn't her fault, because you see, she's sick, she's got kind of a weakness, with men, that is. And every place we been, it's the same all over, somebody gets a spark and somebody winds up getting burned. But I guess as long as you know what to do when she has spells, I guess it's... A spell? Oh, nothing serious, just fits and shouts, nothing violent. And no great harm done, so, just, you know, when she has, something happens to her, she's got a little bottle of pills that she carries around in her bag, and if you just remember that. Now listen here, Mr. Wilson. I know what you're trying to do. But don't give me any stories. Now just don't jump to any conclusions now, just a minute. Now you don't think I actually like to do that, do ya? I have to for his own good. Because I want to stay here now, and the only way I can is if I chase trouble before it chases me. Marge? Marge. Marge? (tense music) You don't understand, Marge. Marge? You don't understand! Yes, I know, Mrs. McCullum, yes. 4:00. Well I know we promised to have it there, but well as a matter of fact, my mechanic hasn't shown up this morning yet. I thought we agreed you were gonna stay home, Emily. Well I changed my plan. I don't care what your plans were, you're gonna stay here. I'm not gonna stay here! I'm going to the beach and dig clams like we planned. Now Emily, I'm not gonna stand around arguing with you all day, I gotta get back to work. Now you're gonna stay here, I'm gonna lock you in. I'm not gonna stay here! Now Emily, you're gonna stay here and you're gonna behave yourself. (door thuds) Those kids are worthless. They didn't even check on your block. - My block come in? - Yeah. Where? It's in a crate in the garage. Oh hang on, I want to talk to you about something. I'm gonna check you out in the cash box. So stick around, huh? I promised Annabelle I'd surprise her for a couple of days. Soon as I get the car fixed I gotta take off. Huh? You what? (banging) Maybe somebody should say something. For instance? Oh, I don't know, anything. Oh no, my friends, family quarrels are the best kind to keep your nose out of. I heard she's been all around town playing the weight machines like they was slot machines. And over at the school yard. Hey! Miss Wilson, please! You can't! That's hotel property, you can't, please! Miss Wilson! (somber music) Get out of here. This room is private. You're not gonna boss me around and neither is he. Oh Emily, I'm not trying to boss you around. It's just that I'm all alone here, you've made a lot of extra work for me. Don't worry about the furniture. I could pay for it. I could get a job. I could do a lot of things. Well, if you're really serious about working, I mean, maybe you and I could work something out over at the restaurant. - Working for you? - Mm-hmm. No, you're just saying that, he told you to. Now listen, Emily... I don't wanna listen to you, go away. Don't call me Emily, either. Only my very special friends can call me Emily. Well what would you say if I told you I'd like to be a very special friend of yours. You can't. Your brother didn't mean any harm, he loves you very much. As far as the work is concerned, he didn't say a word about it, that's my idea. I need the help, you could wait on tables, take care of the customers. You mean I could be a waitress? Mm-hmm. Well, could I have a uniform, and wait on customers? Mm-hmm. See, I used to have waitresses a long time ago, so I have some uniforms. I'm sure I could find something that would be just perfect for you. Okay. I'd like that. Yes, I'd really like that. Does it have an apron? Yes, Emily, it has an apron. I'll go get one, freshen up, and be right back, and we'll get to work, okay? Okay. Then later on we'll figure out your pay. Okay? All right. What color is it? It's blue. I look nice in blue. Can you hear it? Huh? (tinkling music) Can you hear it? How about that, ain't that something, huh? Oh Annabelle's gonna explode when she sees this. I know her, you know, she's sentimental about things like that. Little new surprises, you know? Except for how am I gonna give it to her if you don't change your mind? I can't figure you out, Wilson. Some guys know when they got it made. Here you been just two days, two days, I offer to check you out of a cash box, and leave you on your own, and I'm offering you a better deal than what I offered Johnny. Well don't you like the town? Don't you like the town? Yeah, I like the town. Well then what?! Good morning, Margery. [Marge] Good morning Corey. My, you look beautiful this morning. Just beautiful. Well, my goodness, thank you. To what do I owe the honor of this special visit? (chuckling) Is that any way to speak to a neighbor, uh-huh. It's a rare chance I get to have a cup of coffee in the middle of the morning. But now that I have a responsible assistant, I can just take off without worrying. So I'll have a cup of coffee, cream, sugar. That's good. You know, this Wilson is a very interesting fellow. He's a good man. He's a good mechanic. Of course, he isn't the most sociable guy in the world, but I guess he could grow on you, huh? I was thinking that he could really amount to something around here if he'd just make up his mind to settle down. Too bad he's leaving. Oh, he is leaving? Huh? Yeah, he's working on that car of his now, like it wasn't gonna keep or something. Figures to be out of here by noon tomorrow. Boy, I'm sure gonna hate to see him go. Well, here I am. Emily, you look adorable. Thank you. Now wait a minute, here, first off, take this rag and go clean up all the tables for me, will you do that? Okay. What was I saying? Oh yeah, boy, I'm sure gonna hate to see Eddie go. Looks like somebody hasn't heard the good news yet. I don't guess that Eddie will get lonesome, though. (Corey whistling) (men chattering) [Man] Hi Marge. Well all I was gonna say was as long as you are leaving and I can't stay, well, I thought we all might want to sort of celebrate tonight. Margery hasn't had (mumbling) for quite a long time now, and I'm sure your sister wouldn't mind. You're not listening to a word I say, Eddie. If just once put your mind on something that really is serious, why, you'll learn to like what this town has to offer. It's got some pretty good things to offer. (suspenseful music) Ed! Ed, it's Emily! She's in trouble! Ed! I want my brother. I want my brother. I want my brother. - I want my brother. - Okay, baby. Who are you? - Go away. - That's all right. - I want my brother. - You have him, honey. I want my brother. Go away, keep away from me. Keep away from me. Keep away from me! [Ed] It's all right now, baby. I want my brother, I want my brother. I want my brother! (screaming) I want my... Honey. Oh Ed. I love you, Ed. All right, baby, shh. (crying) Okay. Corey? [Corey] Yeah. What are you doing, closing up for supper? [Corey] Yeah. Where's your new helper? I just stopped by to use the telephone, but if you're in a hurry, I can go on down to the office. No, no, that's all right. Go ahead. Just be sure and lock the door when you go out, huh? It's gonna be long distance, but I'll settle with you later. You don't think I remember what you told me, do you? Well I do. Mind my own business, and keep away from strangers, and be a good girl, and not get into trouble... And to put some clothes on? (sighs) I just wish we could do something fun for a change. Just me and you. (sighs) Like we could go dancing tonight. (sighs) When are you gonna send me to dancing school, Ed? You promised. Someday. Someday I'm gonna be a movie star and I'm gonna dance in the movies. (light jazz music) Care for a dance or two? Just put some clothes on, I said, and don't let this thing go morning, noon, and night. But I was only just... You were only just. (birds chirping) Sure know better what to do about my sister than I do, don't ya? I'm sorry, I only thought it'd be worth a try if I... If you what? I thought if I game Emily some feeling of importance, something to do with herself, like that job, I mean. I think she has to be made to feel she belongs someplace. In your restaurant with that uniform with a bunch of guys pulling over? Don't be silly, wait a minute, I didn't know what she was gonna do with that uniform. I said I was sorry, I only thought... You only thought what? I think this is a lot better than what you're doing. Dragging her from one town to another, one trouble after another. Did I ask you to do anything? No, nobody asked me to do anything. Then will you just stay out of it? No, I won't. You know, I think you're all wrong about Emily. What she needs is a home and love, the kind of love a child needs to grow on. She has to be made to feel that she can just live in this world just like it is. You seem to think you can give her everything you want, well I'm telling you, it's not enough. And besides, I'm not gonna stand by, I'm not gonna let you keep running. You'll ruin her. What does that have to do with you? Because I'm... Because you're what? Because I'm in love with you, that's why. (somber music) Oh god. (crying) I only thought, I just was trying, you told me, you said she was gonna be so much better, and look what I did to you, I didn't... I love you, I love you Marge. I love you. Don't you ever go away from me. Don't you ever go away from me, I don't want you to go away. I don't want you ever to leave. Ever. (crying) Granny? You're gonna see that girl? Now Granny, she's a nice girl. She's trouble, I can smell it, the walkin' wrath of God. You can't smell it. And you can't see it, you don't even know what you're talkin' about. (somber music) Whoa. Whoa! Where are you going? I'm going away. [Kenny] Well what'll your brother say? I don't care. I'm going away, where he'll never find me. What happened? Nothing. He was mean. Well where are you gonna stay? Someplace. But I'm not gonna stay with him anymore. I'll tell you what. There's a place over by the cliff. A cave. You could stay there tonight. Now you can't go no place now anyway. And maybe tomorrow, well I could fix it up so you could sleep. A cave? If you wait right here, I'll go back and get you a blanket. All right. Now I won't be long. Now you wait right here. Hyah! Well look what we have here now. Hi. Hi. Wanna go for a ride? Well. Maybe. Wait, you ever to see a little locket what plays music? No. Well I have one I'd like to give to you. Oh, that's very very nice of you to want to give me a present, Mr. Sherman. But I have to get back right away 'cause my boyfriend's gonna be waiting for me. Oh is that so, huh? Mm-hmm. He's gonna meet me right over there. Is that right? So if it won't take too long... Oh no, just a couple minutes. You can leave your things here. Oh, I just love to get presents. My brother Ed always says that, but I don't have to do what he says anymore. Oh, you don't, well, that's fine. Well do you want to come with me? Okay. (bird chirping) I love you, and I deserve you. I want you to stay with me, for as long as I live. I love you, Marge. I love you. Em? I'm locked out, I don't have my key. (knocking) Em? (tinkling music) (dramatic music) [Skinner] The man's dead, ain't he? Any fool can see, so why... Difference between you and me, Skinner, is I'm not just any kind of a fool. All right, Esmeralda, tell us about it again. Just like I told you before, Sheriff. I was coming home from my day off. When I opened the door, I found that man bending over Mr. Corey, holding that knife in his hand, and looking at me with a wild look, like he might start coming for me, so I just closed the door and locked it, and call in you, Sheriff, just like I said. Mr. Wilson? Just type out the details. I'll sign whatever you put down. It seems to me that so far you're the only one that's got any of the details. She found me, I'm responsible. Whoever was responsible (mumbling). What I mean is, he's got a bunch of nicks and cuts. The one that did the real damage was a nasty crack on the back of the skull. Coulda gotten it falling down. You see, he was sliced at. Something a child might do. Or somebody not really meaning anything major. By the way, it happened at 7:55. That's not medical detection, his watch is busted. Sheriff, I... [Marge] What is this? You'll have to wait a minute, Marge. Ed. You can't do this. Doc, will you give 'em something to shut 'em up? Like they say in the detective stories, we've got to get the evidence. Now. "Your weight is 113 pounds. "Be prepared for a sudden change that may influence your," can't read the rest, there's too much blood. How much did you say you weighed, Mr. Wilson? Margery, do me a favor, read this, will you? My eyes are a little strained. "August 11th, Nashville, Tennessee. "police today released Miss Emily Wilson "to her brother's custody after dropping "assault and battery charges stemming "from Miss Wilson's alleged attack on L.L. Rawlings, "owner of the Wonderland Bookshop on Snow Street. "The charges were dropped when it was learned "that Miss Wilson was a mentally retard..." - Kenny! (dramatic music) Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Kenny! Sheriff. I just... (sighs) Look, Mr. Wilson, I'm a law enforcement officer, not a philosopher, not a preacher. And a law enforcement officer's gotta take sort of a straightforward view of things. So now I think we'd better go and talk with your sister, Mr. Wilson. (waves crashing) (suspenseful music) (somber music)
