(MultiCom Jingle) (soft piano music) (soft jazz music) - How are you holding up? - Better than I thought. - It's not the end of the world, is it? - No, it's not the end of the world. (cell phone buzzing) Hello? (crackling voice) Hello? - Sam. - Hello, Mom? - [Cecilia] Sam, can you hear me? Sam, where are you? I need you. - Something's wrong. I can feel it. - Sam, Sam! Where are you going? Where are you going? Wait, wait, wait where are you going? Tell me what's happening? I thought we were past all this shit. - Something's wrong, I have to go. - What about the press, what about all your friends? - Tell them I'll be back. - Hey, hey! After all the shit I've been through to help you get to where you are. You walk out on me? You're walking out on us. - I'm sorry, I have to go. - [Alex] I told you I'm not dealing with this shit anymore! - Ma, just call him, please! - [Alex] What's up, baby, it's okay. - What's going on? - Dude, I'm over this shit, man. - [Sam] What'd he do? - I told her I'm not gonna deal with this shit anymore. He's never gonna fucking change, okay? You don't know the shit that he's fuckin' rollin' in, alright? He's gonna end up fucking somebody else over and we're gonna end up paying for it. Fuck that! It's okay, baby. It's okay, we're going home. - [Sam] I'll see you later, okay? Alright, I'll call you later. - Do not call me about this shit! I'm done. - Ah, shit! (grunting) Damn it! Sam, Sammy! That you? Come help me out here. (speaking foreign language) - Dad, what's going on in there? - I don't know, I don't care. Come on, papa. - I got you. - Hurry up, I'm late for my shift. - [Sam] Here. - Good, thank you. - [Sam] Sure. - [Bill] Alright. - Can I get you anything? - No, no, no, no, no. Just, (laughs) have fun with that. Alright, I'm leaving. - [Cameron] Leave me alone. - [Cecilia] We are not calling him. - Ma, just call him, it's the only way to get these people out of my life! - What the hell happened to you? - Hey Sam, I fell skateboarding. - Oh yeah, you skateboard now? - Tell him. - Nothing! Look, are you gonna take the car or not? - What car? - Forget about the fucking car! Tell him! - Oh my God! You people make me sick, literally sick! - Chill out! - Baby, baby we need their help. - He's doing heroin. - I'm not doing heroin! - Oh no, then why do you keep taking little pieces of aluminum foil, huh? Those fevers you get, you think I'm an idiot? And you better bring me back my wedding ring! - What are you talking about, ma? I didn't take your ring! - Oh yeah, because I was the one who broke the lock to my door, right? - Cameron, I really hope you're not doing heroin. Do you know how that shit changes your physiology, like literally changes you? - Relax, geez man, I know. Okay? I know. This nigger thinks he's the only one that can look shit up on Google. Besides, I haven't been doing it for that long. - So you have been doing it! - Mom, mom, mom, stop! Hold on, mom, mom, mom, mom! Mom, mom, mom, stop! Mom, calm down! - I swear to God! - Calm down, calm down. Alright, everyone calm down. - Michelle, are you gonna take the car or not? - Oh, my God. - I already told you, I'm not going anywhere! - What car? - Don't worry about it babe, okay? They always do what I want them to do. My friend's car, bro! - Alright, well go take it to him! - I would, but it stalled on me and something that was in the car went missing! - What went missing? - Okay? I don't know! - [Sam] You don't know? Then how do you know it went missing? - Because it was in the car and then (clapping) then it wasn't! - That is what he's asking you. What was in the car? - It was a white box, Mom, but I don't know what was in it! - Cam, do you have this box? - No, look! Mike and I were using the car, okay? - Who's Mike, is he the owner of this car? - No, he's Bosco's brother. - Bosco? Is Bosco the owner of this car? - Yes! I dropped Mike off but on my way to Bosco the car stalled, it wouldn't run! - Alright, then tell him that. - Did you forget about the part where something went missing from his car, Sam? You're supposed to be the smart one! - Hey! - It's fucking Bosco. - Shut up! - Why, who is he? - He's my friend. - You're friend? He is not your fucking friend! This dude owns a Maserati! Okay? Not a fucking Prius, a $200,000 dollar car! Baby, you are fucked! - Okay, okay alright. Cameron, you understand that this isn't normal, right? Do you get it? This is not normal! Cameron, look at me! Look at me, hey! What the fuck are you on? - I'm not on anything! - Oh really, really? - Oh my God, stop lying to them, we need their help! - Will you shut the fuck up? - I will not shut the fuck up, it's the truth! - Stop it! - I don't care! I don't care anymore! - Alright, Michelle. What was in the car, what'd you lose? - Oh, my God. Will you please just help me out and go take this guy his car? Come on, Sam, this is my only way out, man. I'm trying to get away from these people. They're the reason I'm like this. Please just tell him you're bringing him his car, that I'm in jail and that you don't know when I'll be out. Please! - Okay, so say, what, we bring him the keys, we bring him the car, we tell him you got arrested. And how did we get the keys, how, what about the box? - Just. - Look, tell him you came and picked them up from me in jail. And the box, tell him the cops took it when they arrested me. He'll never bother me again. - Okay, but you gotta do your part, okay? You have to stop. - I will, okay? I will. - What's his number? - I'll call him. - [Sam] What's his name again? - Bosco. - [Sam] Bosco. (phone ringing) - [Bosco] Who is this? - Hi, is this Bosco? - [Bosco] Who is this? - I'm Cameron's brother. - [Bosco] I don't give a fuck! What do you want? - I'm trying to get your car back to you. - [Bosco] Why do you have my fucking car? - I don't actually have your car, but I'm trying to arrange a way for you to get it. Where does he live? - I don't know. - [Bosco] Where's Cam? - He's locked up. - [Bosco] Put Cam on the phone, please! - Look, I'm just telling you what my mom told me, alright? She told me that Cam and Mike were driving someplace, he dropped Mike off, he was going to return the car to you, it stalled on the highway. And then somewhere along those lines he got arrested. That's it, that's what she told me. (Bosco laughing) She told me this in Spanish. - You're lying to me. I might have misunderstood something, but... - [Bosco] I don't believe you. - Cam isn't here! - [Bosco] Stop fucking around with me and put Cam on the phone! - Hello, hello? - [Bosco] Cameron? - Hello? Who the fuck is this? - I told you! You think everybody doesn't know you're a fucking liar? - Relax, relax, okay? Ma, ma you know who it is. You remember when you picked me up from Brooklyn last week? It was the guy with the Maserati. - So this is the same? Oh, my fucking God! Are you sending mom and Michelle to return this guy's car? - Thank you, thank you! - Get the fuck off me! Why are you even here, man? Did ma call you? You calling in the troops? Oh, you love this, don't you? Yeah, you and Alex. You both need people like me so you can point your fingers and say, ooh, that's the bad guy! - Yeah well, right now you're not really acting like a good guy! Are you? - I'm whatever I need to be. - You're a fucking liar! - Stop calling me a liar! - But it's true, though, you are lying! (all screaming) - Stop it! Stop it, stop it! I'm just gonna go take this Bosco guy his car, okay? I don't want any more of your problems. - Mom, wait! Does he know where you live? - Everyone knows where Cam lives. Fuck. - Lock the doors and text me his number. - Really, lock the doors? Man dramatic, bro! - Not letting you go alone! I'll meet you in the car. - Fucking asshole! - Wait, you need a jacket! (tape rewinding) Cam? Papa? - [Sam] Cameron! - Sam? - [Sam] Cam? - What's wrong? - Where's Cameron? - I just got here. - Oh, my God! - What are you doing in there? It's freezing! (laughs) - Jesus Christ, this is crazy. Mom, he called me. Said he was tired of not feeling loved, of feeling alone. - Why didn't you-- - He said he was gonna kill himself. - Why didn't you call me? - Mom, he needs psychiatric help. - I know, I took him to the doctor. You know what they told me? They told me I was the one who was crazy. - What? What are we gonna do? - I don't know. What can I do? It's not like before when he was 14 or 15. He's gonna be 19 in a few months and there's nothing I can do for him. Legally, if he doesn't want the help. He went away to that school and I thought he'd come back better, but he won't get a job. He won't go to church. He won't take his medication and he won't stop doing drugs. I don't know how much longer I can take this. - We'll figure something out. We gotta get him outta there. (ominous music) - Why are you here? - I'm trying to help you keep your job. I don't know what's going on, Cecilia. But remember you have an obligation to your students that supercedes your own needs. Think that through. This may not be where you should be. Have a good day. - Okay, sorry about that. Let's begin. (door slamming) (melancholy music) He said the two would be here in 30 minutes. - It's been 45. (opera music on radio) - I wanted to do that. Be an opera singer like my Tia Ana. - I didn't know that. Why didn't you? - I think it was just too big a dream for me. Then I had you guys. - I think I'm gonna write about all this. - Like a book? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Mmhmm. - That's good. - Just tell me if you don't want me to do it. - No, do it, do it. Maybe it will do someone some good. How did it get so bad? - I don't know. How much longer can we keep it up? Till he's 30, 40? - Sam, believe me, if I could jump inside his body and change him I would, but for now, we just have to help him. Cameron's not like you or Alex. He's always needed us. He said he's gonna go back to rehab, so that'll give me 30 days to focus, to really focus. - If he stays the 30 days. - He said he was this time. And Michelle's going with him. - Can I see the keys? (alarm beeping) (engine revving) I thought he said it wouldn't start. - He said the battery stalled. I don't know, maybe it needed to rest. What are you looking for? - I don't know. Something doesn't feel right. Mom, what is it, what's going on? - Something's wrong. - What is it? - It's Cameron. - What? - It's Cameron, it's Cameron. - What are you talking about? Mom, it's alright. - Oh, my God! - Mom, Mom, Mom! - No, no, no, no, no, no, no! - What is happening? - No, no! (crying) Please, please, no! (moaning) (speaking foreign language) - Mom, it's alright. (crying) (police radio chattering) - The detective tells me how he died. Dozens of pictures before me, still he tells me how he died. How Cameron drowned in our backyard pool after he was shot in the back twice. He warns me then flips the folder open, Michelle's head open, the left side more intact. I could almost tell it was her. It's honest, it's, it's dark. I'm just concerned that the overall tone is on a par to Blackout. (muffled talking) - Anybody wanna tell me how good my turkey is? - [Sam] It's really good, Mom. - It's good, right? I wish Deanna and Emily were here. - Yeah, I know, me too. They're still down in Florida with her parents. - You know what, we should do a family trip. You want that papa, you go down to Florida? - No! (laughs) Hey, hey check these out. You tell me how much you think's-- - Bill, don't start. I thought you getting a desk job meant that the basement was gonna start looking the way it did before you started filling it up with junk. - Antiques. - [Cecilia] Antiques? - Dad, I don't think these are worth very much. - These are the first memory cards ever made. - These are USB drives. It's a USB drive, Pop. (laughs) - And technology doesn't really gain value with time. - How much do you think the iPhone costs now compared to what it was when it first came out? - Yeah, but these aren't the first iPhones. This is not the first that's anything (laughs) sorry. - Dream killers. - [Sam] Sorry, Pop. - Give it back. - [Sam] No, I want it. - Forget about it, give it back. - You wanna eat? Let me get you some juice, okay papa? - [Alex] Dad, you want some gravy? - Thank you. (men chattering) Thank you. - [Alex] Sorry, Dad. - [Bill] That's the last advice I ever ask you. - [Sam] Aw, come on. - [Cecilia] Hey. - Thank you. - Okay here, drink that. Why don't you tell Sam about your new job? - You got a job? - I got him the job. - Wow, what is it? - [Cecilia] Come on, tell him what you're doing. - Just loading shit into a warehouse. - You're welcome. - Well, that's good. You never know where there's room to grow. - That's right. I keep telling him that, you never know. You just gotta be positive. Every job is an opportunity to discover something new, to discover something different. You know? Are you tired of being home? - Did you put something in this? - What? No. - What's that bitter taste, then? - I don't, you want me to try it? - No, we're supposed to trust each other, Ma! The counselor told us we're supposed to trust each other. But how the fuck am I supposed to do that-- - Oh! - When you keep doing shit like this? - Alright, okay I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Whoa, dude! - You ungrateful little fuck! - Wait don't, stop, Bill, stop, stop! There's no fighting this Thanksgiving! - You can't let him get away with that! (speaking foreign language) - I'm done. I'm sorry. (speaking foreign language) - Dad. - [Sam] I thought you and I could use a little rum. - Thanks. That was the worst Thanksgiving dinner ever. - At least it's over. (glasses clinking) You excited? - About what? - Spring semester. - I think I'm gonna take some time off. - Won't that affect your candidacy for tenure? - Sam, they're never gonna give me tenure. - But, you were looking forward to teaching that Shakespeare class. - I don't know, I just, I'm ready for a change. I'm thinking about doing real estate. I can work from home, make my own hours. - I don't know, Mom, you were, you waited three years to teach that class. - Shakespeare isn't going anywhere. - They can't come in here, Mom can't come in here. Fuck, man! This isn't fucking normal, Sam! People aren't supposed to go through this shit, man! I keep fucking waking up in this goddamn fucking nightmare! Nothing seems to fucking make sense anymore! This isn't who we are! Right? Look at this shit. Thinking about moving to Miami, we're selling the house. Taking Mom and Dad with me. And get a fresh start. No one should be dealing with this shit. Sam, are you scared, man? - [Cameron] You want something to drink? - No, I'm alright. - [Cameron] Good, 'cause I didn't get you anything. (laughs) - [Sam] Really, you're gonna smoke right here? - Relax, bro, it's not gonna go in the house. - [Sam] How are you? - [Cameron] I'm good. - Nah. I mean, like, how's everything been at home? - (laughs) I'm as good as I'm gonna get. I'm selling heroin, coke too. If any of your friends need it, let me know, I got 'em. - Damn. That's heavy. Cameron? - Yeah? - Just be careful. - I know man, I'm not stupid. - Alright. - Besides, it's not like any of this shit even matters. Look at the sun. It's gonna die. The stars, the universe, it all ends for everything, man. None of it matters. - You sound like you've already given up. - Nah, I just understand how shit works now. All the little things inside the big things start to become the same thing. It invalidates everything. Just think about it, man, this explosion. (laughs) Scary, right? - Yeah. You know what's really scary? - What? - Thinking about your 13 year old self's opinion of yourself. (laughs) - What? - I picture my 13 year old self walking into my room, checking out my shit, looking at my room, my apartment, the diploma on the wall. Seeing how much I aged. It can really mess with you. What about yours? What would your 13 year old self feel if he saw you? - If he saw me? - [Sam] Yeah. - He would feel nothing because he wouldn't know me. - I think I'm gonna write about all this. - What do you mean? - About, you know, all this, you. - What are you gonna call it? - I don't know. It can't be a word, it has to be like a feeling. - Maybe you'll write me a happy ending. - [Sam] Yeah, hopefully. (melancholy music) Hey. - I'm really sorry. - I could have done something. - It's not your fault, it's not your fault. You cannot blame yourself. He was too far gone. - I'm not sure, I'm not. - Look, you told his story. That's gonna keep him alive. (cell phone buzzing) - Yeah, Dad, what's up? - It was fast. Bosco had a very strong alibi, confirmed by over a dozen people. They couldn't find his prints in the house. They're letting him go. - What? - They can't charge him with anything. They're letting him go. I'm on my way over there. - Hey, do you know if Mom's still sleeping? - They're letting him go. - What? - Yeah, Dad called, they're letting him go. What are we going to do? What are we gonna tell Mom? - Whatever we fucking, whatever we have to. Alright, whatever we have to. (Alex sighing) - I wish we could just like, oh, move the whole family here. Like, be safe, you know? Out of the city, safe. - You like that house? - Yeah, I like that, that's pretty. - Good. - That's my lucky number, too. - How about that? Me, too. - [Cecilia] What? - You really like that house? - [Cecilia] Yeah. - Good. I'm glad you like it because you own it. - What do you mean I own it? - We own it. - What? - Happy anniversary. (laughs) - Oh, my God! For real? (speaking foreign language) (laughs) - It's got a big pool in the back. - Let's go see! - Let's go swimming! - [Cecilia] Let's go! (laughing) (speaking foreign language) - Cece, please just come. Okay, breathe with me, okay, 'cause you're very nervous. Breathe, okay. (speaking foreign language) One day at a time, okay? - Okay. - Okay, breathe. - I wanna go home. - Why, I'm taking care of you here. - Because everything is there. Everything of his is there, I wanna go home. - No, come on let's, breathe with me a little bit. - [Cecilia] I wanna go home, I wanna go home. - [Wilma] Cece, please you have to breathe. - [Cecilia] I wanna go home! - [Wilma] Cece! - [Cecilia] Where'd you get that? - [Cameron] Relax, I didn't steal it. Where are your records? - Beneath the TV. (laughs) - [Cameron] Here, check these out. - Oh man, I haven't seen these in so long. Oh, you have to play this. It's my favorite. - I had a weird dream last night. - Oh yeah, what was it about? - Just a weird dream. - Dreams are very powerful things, like a web. You're at the center of it and dreams are everything that extends outward. Everything you are, are meant to be, were. But, you know, you can't be all those things in real life, so dreams are a nice way-- - It was a bad dream. Just me driving on some dark highway. It works. (laughs) - Ooh, I love this. (both laughing) Tell me more about your dream, papa. - Don't worry about it, it's nothing. I got you these seeds. - What? What are these? (laughs) - Relax, Ma, they're just flowers, okay? I was helping Miss Russo, the old lady next door, clean out her garage. She gave me the record player and 40 bucks. So that was pretty awesome. She um, she told me she hears us yelling and screaming all the time, so she gave me these. Said to plant 'em in the front of the house, that they'd being happiness. - I love you, papa. - I um, I know I've been kind of bad lately. But um, (laughs) I'm gonna go clean. Okay? I promise. (speaking foreign language) - You're a good boy. I know you are. (speaking foreign language) - There was a fight a few weeks ago, some classroom disturbances. Truancy is the real issue here, however. Out of 62 school days so far, he has only attended 19 of them. Our psychologist evaluated him yesterday and there was nothing troubling or remarkable. - Nothing? - Nothing that he could see, anyway. We can consider after school programs, mentoring, but if he's not willing to attend them, then there really is no point. Whatever he's going through, that change has to come from within him. - You're telling me I have to just be patient? - You know what they say. Patience is bitter, the fruit is sweet. He is a good kid, Cecilia. He will realize what he has to do soon enough. - What if he doesn't? - If he doesn't then we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Okay? - Okay. (school bell ringing) - [Sam] Hey, there's the birthday girl! - No! - [Sam] What is it? - Where's Cameron? - He left with Alex, why? - My purse is missing. - Shit. - Yeah, I need to report this. - What? - I need to report that my stuff is missing, Sam. He has my credit cards, my identification, my work phone. - Alright, well maybe it's here someplace. - No, because it was right fucking here! God, fuck that fucking drug addict! Why did you invite him? - Because I want to feel like I have a normal fucking family sometimes. - I should have said no, but then I would have been the asshole. But I told you, I fucking told you! You know what an enabler is? Open your eyes, Sam! Or are they only open for your book? You need to fix this. (knocking) - Cam? - [Cameron] I'm not going! - What the hell do you mean, you're not going? Cameron, open this damn door. Don't play with me, Cameron! Okay, do what you want. You wanna stay and do eight years in prison? Stay and throw away all the money I spent on that lawyer! But you better think about your future, boy, because you're still only 17. This is your last chance to start over. (banging) Cameron? You choose because I'm done! I've done enough! (thudding) - Cameron? - Cameron! Cameron! Stop the car, get out of the car! Get out of the car! (panting) (ominous music) - It's too late. - [Cecilia] What? - [Man] They waited for over an hour, Cecilia. - Did you tell them I had an emergency? - I did, I did but you can't keep these people waiting. It's over. - I'll appeal it. - You'll appeal it? - Yes. - And then what? You win and you're allowed back. How many more classes are you gonna miss? How you gonna get your evaluations out of the toilet? I've been patient, Cecilia, believe me. I've been really patient. We're gonna offer you paid suspension. Take it, take it. Take it and just walk away, okay? I'm sorry. - As far as the wine we'll go with the Pinot Noir. - [Cecilia] Can I get a Long Island? - Oh, my God, what are you doing here? - I missed my baby sister, I thought I'd stop by. Are you busy, is now a good time? - Oh yeah, yeah, it's fine. I wish you would have told me you were coming. I would have opened the kitchen for you. - No, no it's fine. It's just one of those spur of the moment things, you know. - Cece, you hate the city. You live 50 miles away. What's going on? - I got fired. - What? I thought you were getting tenure. (laughs) - That's a joke. How about that drink? (laughs) - Merlot? Two merlots, please. - You know I thought I could do it, Wilma. I thought I could do both, have a family and have a successful career. - You did, you are doing it. - Cameron's doing something. He's up to something, I don't know what it is. (speaking foreign language) No, no it's not all his fault, you know? He has issues. We moved out to Long Island because we thought that's what you do, you buy the house, you put the flag out in the front. That was the dream, right, when Mami came here? That's what she told us. But, we're not doing it right. I don't know, somehow I'm failing. I feel like I'm failing him-- - Listen to yourself. - I'm failing my family. I'm just, I'm failing everybody. - You have to stop! You have to stop blaming yourself for whatever Cameron chooses to do. He's not a child anymore. He knows that his actions have consequences, yet he continues to behave the same way. You have to focus on the rest of your family. Why do you think Sam moved out? - Why he got that job in the city? - He could have waited tables anywhere, but he chooses the city. Why do you think that is? This thing with Cameron, it doesn't only affect you, Cece. It hurts me, it hurts your boys, it hurts Bill. - Okay, you know what? Enough, Wilma. (speaking foreign language) - Nobody can say anything because you don't wanna hear it. - No, you have said enough. - What's wrong? Missing pills again? - I don't know, I don't, maybe... - Every time those pills mysteriously disappear, where do you think they go? Hmm? - Hey Kevin, have you seen Cameron? - Yo Kev, come over! Want a hit? - Oh shit, let's go upstairs. I'm sure he's fine. - It's been three days. We haven't heard back from him. - When he runs out of money, he'll come back. - So you don't know where he is? - I know he's been spending a lot of time in Brooklyn, but we haven't spoken to each other in a while. Do you know who he's been hanging around with? - No, we don't know anything. We just wanna make sure he's okay. - What would you do if you were, I don't know, a five year old? And someone comes up to you and gives you a free piece of candy. The next day they give you two pieces. What do you do on the third day when that person doesn't show up? You go looking for them, right? - Right. - That's who he's been hanging around with. (tea kettle whistling) - How is she? - It's been difficult. Alex brought Emily over yesterday and that cheered her up a bit, but... She wants to go home. I think it's too soon. But you know how she is. So, they let him go. - Does she know that? - No, of course not. - Okay. - Cece? You awake? Look who's here. - Mom? Mom, you awake? Tia was telling me that Emily spent the day with you here yesterday. Have you been taking your medication? You know you have to take them. They'll make you feel better. Look what I brought you. Remember when you gave me these books? Samuel, happy first day of school. I hope you understand our decision in moving out here and see that Long Island is not so bad. I'm sure you'll make lots of new friends and in a year you can have your own car. No more trains. I'll be here to talk when you're ready. Love, Mom. - Today has, it's been a bad day. - How would you like to come stay with me for a few days? Would you like that? What do you think? (festive Latin music) - [Cecilia] Hey, what are you doing out here? - Just waiting for Alex and Cam. - You okay, papa? - I just don't want things to go back to the way they were before he left. - They won't, they won't. - Mom, I can't see next year, I can't see the next five years. Waiting tables was not part of the plan. - Well, maybe you need to shift your focus, you know? Go back to writing your book. - I don't know. - Look, it's a cliche, but they say it because it's true. Write about what you know. Write about what you love, what makes you happy, what makes you tick, what scares you. - A lot of things scare me these days, Mom. - Alright, come on, you can (laughs). It's all about, it's just all about focusing. You know? Allowing yourself to go there. It's gonna be different, he's changed. - I wouldn't get your hopes up. - You can be so cynical. (horn honking) Ooh, there's my baby! (laughs) - So, I pick him up at the train station. I leave him in the car for five minutes to go get groceries and this little piece of shit-- - [Cecilia] Wait a minute. - Fucking takes off in my car! Get out of the fucking car! - What are you doing? - Get out of the car! - Alex! - He's fucking stoned. He's been gone for two years. The first time we see you and you're already fucking stoned, aren't you? - Jesus Christ. Stop yelling, you're here, okay? Are you alright? - Welcome fucking home! Little shit. - [Cecilia] You okay, papa? - Cecilia, just leave him there. - Can you make it? Oh, my little baby, I miss you. - Ma, you need help? - [Cecilia] Yeah. Thank you, papa. - You're welcome. I gotta head out of here. - What? But it's still early! - Yeah, I know, but the party's over and I gotta be up at three in the morning. - You still working on that housing development? - Yeah, yeah, I am. Uh, listen, I gave Cam the list of interviews he's got for tomorrow. They're not the classiest jobs, but it's a start. Can you just make sure that he makes it there? - Yeah, don't worry, I will. I will, don't worry, okay? - [Alex] Alright, no, I'm not worried. Okay. - I'll drive him myself. Okay? - Cool, and make sure he brings his resume with him, please. - Okay. - Good, I know. (laughs) Alright, I gotta go, Mom. - Okay. - Alright. (speaking foreign language) - I love you. - I love you too, papa. - I'm sorry I didn't get to go up there that much. - [Cameron] It's cool. It's a bitch of a drive, I wouldn't have gone up either. - Yeah. Alex tells me about all the interviews he has lined up for you. - Yeah, a bunch of weak-ass jobs. - [Sam] It's better than sitting here, though, right? - Yeah. What about you, you still doing that writing thing? - Yeah, yeah, I'm still doing the writing thing. - [Cameron] That's cool. Gotta do what you love, right? - Yeah. What about you? What do you love? (laughs) - What do you love? (laughs) You sound like my counselor, man. - [Sam] Alright. - [Cameron] You wanna smoke? - Nah, you know I don't do that no more. - [Cameron] Yeah, yeah. I'm selling heroin, coke too. (voices echoing) - Thank you, Annie. Anyone else? Anyone else? - I uh, lost my daughter Paige, six months and 10 days ago. Overdose. It's completely ripping us apart, me and my wife. The sense of pain and the desperation, the guilt that comes along with it is like, it's unlike anything I've... I mean, still, six months... (stammering) I haven't had a moment of silence up here and I'm afraid that when that moment comes, when I finally stop thinking about it, that's when I'm afraid that it's going to be too much. To be alone in the silence. Without her laugh or without me being able to tell her how much I love her. (man sobbing) She was only 17. I just miss her so much! - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Sam I wanna go home. - Okay. - So, what do you think? Should I just take the sign off right now? (laughs) Ms. Dern, Miss Newman, I am so sorry I'm late. - It's alright, gave us a chance to check out the backyard. - Big, isn't it? Let's go, come on I'll show you the rest of the house. If I can find the keys, okay. So what's great about this layout is that you can convert the media room into a third bedroom. That's room to grow. - How many square feet is it? - About 1600 square feet. (cell phone buzzing) Oh, excuse me for a second. Hello. Oh, you're kidding. Jesus Christ, I'll be right there. I am so sorry, but... Unbelievable. What the hell happened? - [Cameron] It's nothing, she just ran out of money, so they kicked her out. - I'm sorry, I rushed my clients out of the house so I could give her a ride? Who are you? - Hi, I'm Michelle. - Hi, Michelle. Who's Michelle? - Oh, my God, Ma, you're gonna drive me fucking crazy. - I'm gonna drive you fucking crazy? - Yeah. - This is the third time this week you have called me with this bullshit, Cameron, come on! I'm trying to keep this job. - I know, but she has nowhere else to go! So she's gonna be staying with us for a few days, okay? - Oh, great. - Come on, you know I love you. (speaking foreign language) - You're gonna make me crazy. You're gonna kill me. - Thank you so much. - Come on, let's go, bring your pink bag. Get her bag, be a gentlemen at least. - No. I'm not raising someone else's kid. - It's only a few days. - A few days. A few days turn into a few weeks, turns into a few months. No! - I already told her she could stay. - Untell her. She isn't staying. And Cameron needs to think about getting his own place, too. - What does that mean? So you're gonna kick him out now, is that what's happening? So that's your answer now for everything, right? You just wanna kick him out. - Cecilia, what are you doing? You're losing sight of everything because you can't cut the fucking umbilical cord! You already gave birth to him. You're waiting around for him to kill you? He almost killed me! He has you in the palm of his hand and you can't see it! You need to make the choice. Yeah, I'm telling you right now. Make a choice! - Oh yeah, go, walk away Bill! That's what you always do, anyway, you disappear! - Bullshit! I've been right here the whole time! Paying my dues! But you don't see me anymore! No! Look at me! Look what he's done to me! What you've done to me! (sobbing) (laughs) You remember when you had to play the pumpkin in that Thanksgiving play? You had to get your hair cut but that guy in the barber shop didn't know how to cut your hair? So you gave yourself a buzz cut. (laughs) I remember when we went to that amusement park and you wanted to get on that roller coaster. You made me get in the front with you. You made me get on that five times in the front. I was so scared. And you kept saying, you just gotta let go, Ma. You just gotta let go. Was this my fault? - Alex and I cleaned everything. Washed everything ourselves. We didn't want them to touch his things any more than they already have. I've been doing some reading about well, how to pass the time, I guess. - What's this? - [Sam] Singing classes. - Singing classes? - Yeah, to help take your mind off things. - Why does everyone keep saying that? Why does everybody keep saying that? I don't wanna take my mind off it. My son just died. I don't wanna take my mind off that. This just isn't the same. None of this is the same. - I'll wait for you downstairs. Let me know if you need anything, okay? (somber opera music) - They didn't. It's empty! Why is this empty? (sighing) (sniffing) I can't smell him. I can't smell him. No! (sobbing) No! No, no, no, no! No, no, no! (screaming) - [Cameron] Ta-da! - No, no, no Cam, no. - Come on. - Babe, once you start doing that shit. Come on, just smoke it. Or chip it, I'll do it with you. - No, you're not. - Yeah, I am, come on. I'll do it with you. - Let me just, let me just do it this one time. I'll do it here, with you, safe. Besides, I gotta test the merchandise. Quality control. This is work. - I'm still pretty toasted. You're not high? - Yeah, but this is different. Get me a spoon? (rap music) * Can't take it * Can't take it * What life you wanna live * What path you tryin' to go * Reflection on my city * All I see is blow * Nobody ever gave me shit, though * * Why you watchin' me go * Wanna a piece of this life * That's history * Middle finger's up I'm chasing three * * Father told me don't grab game * * Don't game, the same thing * B-I-G, I'm screamin' it * Street life, I'm meanin' it * Feet forward, I gotta get out * * Bright lights and gold chains * * Long nights, I'm not free * Fuck that, I know me * Greater self, I owe me * Almost took my life at 19 * Honestly, you don't know me * Make a toast for these young kings * * Only thing got fast me * All our rappers they're ADT * I'm so high my nose bleed * These second people they don't know me * * Take it all * I can't take it * I can't take it * I can't, I can't take it * I can't take it * I can't take it * I can't take it * I can't take it (fast rap music) - Get out, get out! I will kill you before you kill me! - Bill, what the hell are you doing? - Cecilia, I've had it! I'm not gonna take his shit anymore! No more! - He sold the car. - Dad's car? - Yeah. He said he heard a number on the radio, called, they came, they took the car, they gave him $200 dollars. I'm afraid of him. For him, for all of us. You know, we've had to start sleeping with the doors locked at night. The other night I woke up and he was hovering over me. He said he's been hearing voices in his head and they tell him what to do. - Oh yeah, right, so now he's schizophrenic? - Oh, Sam. You know, when you were little I was scared of this moment. The moment when children stop being children and they become adults. But it never comes. No matter what you do or how bad it gets, you'll always be my little babies. - How much is in there? - [Cecilia] 10 grand. - [Alex] What did Dad say? - He doesn't know. - He lied to us. - Have you thought about what you're gonna do with the money? - What do you mean? - It's a lot of money. - I'm not taking that money. - You can cover the funeral expenses with it. - I already said, I'm not touching that money. - [Sam] Why not? - Why not? What's the matter with you? Think for a second! - It's true though, you've already lost so much. - That money got your brother killed! - Yeah, we understand that, Mom, but right now you and Dad need it. - How much did you loan me for the funeral? - Oh, that doesn't matter. - Alex, how much did you lend me, two grand? - Mom, please. - Here, here you go, take the money. Take the money. Alright, you happy? Now get the hell out! Get out, get the hell out! Go! (melancholy violin music) - Whoa. - Jesus. - Watch where you're going, bitch. - [Michelle Voiceover] This dude owns a Maserati! - [Cameron Voiceover] Ma, you know who he is. The guy with the Maserati. (dramatic music) (knocking) - Oh, shit. (speaking foreign language) What are you doing here? - Why haven't you returned my calls? - I've been busy. - Yeah, Dad spoke to me. He said you didn't come home last night. - Sam, please. - You're losing the house? What happened to you getting a job? It's always gonna be like this, isn't it? - Like what, huh? Like what? Am I supposed to just forget that my son died six months ago? Or that the man who killed him is out there walking around free? - How do you know that? - You lied to me, Sam! You lied to me! I saw him! I smelled him! I looked into his eyes and you know what? He had no idea who I was or what he did to me. So, I'm sorry if this is all a little bit too emotional for you, but right now my world has changed! - Yeah, well you're not alone! I loved Cameron, too! But do you think he cared about the pain that he brought us? The danger he put us in? No! I think about how lucky we were to have left before everything happened in that house! That's what I think about and I think about it every single day! And I'm thankful. You know, I was thankful for the fact that I was alive after it. I was thankful for the fact that you were safe. And a part of me was thankful for the peace that I thought that his death would bring our family! - You son of a bitch! - Mom, Mom! Mom, Mom, you stop! He's gone, alright? He's gone! He's gone! He's fucking gone and oh my, God, the way that he still haunts our family is just fucking unbelievable! So I don't know what your plans are, I don't know if you're gonna let this destroy you, but I'm done and I'm gone. - Sam. Sam! (dramatic music) Don't move. I think about everything you've taken from me. Everything I've loved and I think there must be a reason for all this. There must be a balance. Maybe this will help tip the scales. (gun firing) (Bosco gasping) - I can't move, I can't move! Help me! Help me! No, no, no, no, fuck! - Rot in hell, you son of a bitch. (muffled yelling) (gasping) (haunting laughter) Cameron? (gasping) (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) - What the hell did you bring in with you? I felt you coming. Come on. Why did you come here? - I need help. - Yes, you do. - I need to get rid of someone. (speaking foreign language) - A curse? I think I have a better solution for you. - I don't understand. - [Sorida] You will. - Why are you so fucking nervous? We haven't done anything yet. Sweetheart, lose the shades. Put your hands up against the fucking fence. - What? - Come on, let's go, I'm in a hurry. - [Cecilia] What are you doing? - I wanna make sure you're not a goddamn cop. - I, I'm not a cop. - Stop moving. - So, what do we do now? - You got a picture, a name, an address? What do you got? - [Cecilia] Yes, all of it. - Give it to me. What did he do? No, actually, I don't really give a fuck, I had a long week. My fee is $6,000 dollars, cash, upfront, not negotiable. Do you understand that? - Okay. Anything else? - I'll call you and I'll see you in a few days. You are fucking late. - I'm sorry. - We're on, 5 p.m. - [Sam] How is she? - I don't know. Remember I told you about Miami? - Yeah, yeah. - Me and Deanna are gonna head down there this weekend and check out this house. - Oh. - Her parents said we could stay with them until we find something. - That's great, that's great, wow. I hear the housing market is looking really great down there. - Yeah, it's picking up. Alright, man. I gotta get back to work. Call you later. - Alex, hey. - It's a book. - Yeah, it's a book. - Thanks, Mom. (tense music) - It's 5:15, where are you? You told me to be here at 5 o'clock. Call me back! Shit! Where is he? - [Sorida] What? - The man you sent me to. Where is he? - I don't know where he is. - You gave me his number, don't tell me you don't know where he is. (speaking foreign language) - Stop! - What are you gonna do with that? (laughs) You're not gonna kill me. - Just tell me where he is. - You've known from the moment you walked in here what you had to do yourself! - Give me back the money I gave you. - Or what? You gonna call the police? Tell them you wanted me to hire you a hit man? (laughing) - [Cecilia Voiceover] You're to blame. Maybe you are. (kissing) - [Cameron] Okay, okay. - [Sorida Voiceover] You've known from the moment you walked in here what you had to do yourself! - [Cecilia Voiceover] I love you, papa. - [Cameron Voiceover] I love you too, Mom. I'm gonna go clean. I promise. (speaking foreign language) (tires screeching) (knocking) (gun firing) - [Cecilia Voiceover] Sam, can you hear me? Can you hear me? (melancholy music)
