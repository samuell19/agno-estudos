Adrian... Wake up. - Breakfast was very good. - It was. I'm glad you liked it. Get ready. We have to go. - Give me a hand, will you? - Okay. Podcast, that's our secret weapon. We've never tried it. Let's try it. I'm guessing you're producing them? We can make it short, cheap, and effective. Honestly, so who's going to listen to that? It's hair product. Isn't our target women between 20 and 40 years old? So, Marissa can you pass along our research... So, can you tell them what video channels our target usually subscribes to? Okay... so what we found was our target usually watches fitness, wellness, cosmetics. - We get it. - Good. Good job in there guys. Adrian, take a walk with me please? Okay. Thank you. She's still got a lot to learn but she will get it. Right... So, those podcasts... You don't like the idea? No, it's great. Are you sure you can handle all the extra prep work? Can you send me a full outline at the end of the month? Yes, sure. Great. So I'll meet with up Hobbs and his people and see if he approves. Do you think maybe I could sit in your next meeting with them? Not so fast... You'll get your chance. Okay? I know that you were doing plumbing for the longest time. - Yeah. - So why did you decide to go back to art? Well I mean I always wanted to do this. I always wanted to be an artist and a painter and you know, I was just doing the plumber thing because I had to. I had bills to pay. I had to take care of my girlfriend and here we are. Here we are. Yeah. And you're doing really good. Tell me about the travel to Colombia. Colombia? Yeah, yeah. I went down there for a summer. I took a trip down there this summer. with my, uh, with my girlfriend. Um, it's actually really tough, talking about that. just because I'm not with her anymore. Thank you. Seven, seven. Sev- Eight. - What if you try it? - What? You know what I'm talking about. I don't know. Is it for our anniversary or something like that? Tell them! Tell your parents! - Do it for me. - Sebas... Not right now. Do it for me... Don't be annoying... Pretend I'm them. No. No. Not right now. Please? Okay,?ne. Okay. Okay. Dad... Mom... No! No. No! Not until you say it. What? What? Please? Go ahead. Okay... Dad... Yes... Mom... Mhmm... I'm pregnant! Ah, no! And they're twins! Look, they're twins! Look! Yes. Feel them. They're twins. Stop. I'm being serious. You know what? I'm really hungry right now. Come on. Just say it. Please? But I'm hungry... I'm going to put a pizza in the oven. - Are you serious?... - Yes You look amazing mom! Thank you sweetie. Have fun mom! Love you! Okay. I have to go! - Bye! - I love you! Guess who I saw? I have no idea. Amanda! Did you catch the game the other night? You should call her. She's not seeing anyone. I always liked her... She's a good match for you. But that's up to me, isn't it? Besides, that was 10 years ago. Fine. Did you think about our proposal? Not really. We want you running the business. I can manage it from here. But, we need you here. Sorry to bother you Sebastia'n... You think I could talk to you a minute? You think that I could just?nish this? I'll be quick. I promise. Okay. What happened? The short... Your H-1B visa application wasn't approved. I'm really sorry about this but you know we never made you any promises. You're free to stay until your current PTO ends. Is there any way you could help? I could shoot some emails to some colleagues, see if they're looking for someone. Just want you to know I appreciate your work and I know you'll?nd something good. Put yourself in my position. I don't want to return to that shithole. And honestly... It's not the right time to tell my parents the truth. But you can't just... ignore the situation. "lie to them forever. This would be really hard for them, babe. It could really... "It could really hurt them. Hey! You don't know that for sure, do you? You know what to say, right? Same thing as last time. Show them how hard you've worked to get here. - Okay. - Perfect. Today's your day. What if it isn't? Don't say that. Look... You look amazing baby! What's Vias Saludables? Yeah, it's a non-profit that helps people in poor areas and I was an intern. What did you do for them? Organized events and taught children English. So, what do you prefer that orjournalism? Journalism, of course. Listen... I took this meeting because your boss is a friend and you've got a great resume but the immigration situation. What are we gonna do about it? If it's the fees and paperwork I would be willing to pay for it. It's a bit more complicated than that. Our company doesn't normally do this. I really want to be here and I need your help. Look I understand, I really do. But it's not that simple. Yeah I know. It's just that... I can't go back. My entire family abandoned me, and and I was living in a tiny garage in Bogota. I'll pass your application to some others. And I'll put in a good word. ButI can't promise you anything. Yeah. Sorry. - Thank you. - Good luck. Got a minute? What's up? Excuse me? I was wondering if that writing position was ever?lled? Yes, why? - You've got room for one more, right? - Sorry? Ok, I just know this guy just graduated I think he could be really good on our team. I love the idea that you are trying to help a friend, Adrian. I've been there. I know. But... We should be focusing on your situation first. That's what you're supposed to say, right? Come on... How are the scripts for the vid component? Could you talk at least to him? How are they going? They're going... Marissa is working on them. We need the help. Yeah. But they're your responsibility, right? I need to see something next week. Excuse me? You will see. Thank you. Have you done any recent job interviews? No. What if he finds a job that helps him extend his visa? He can't extend his visa anymore than he already has. He would need a job related to his academic?eld. They don't want more immigrants working as janitors. We already have enough of those. He could get a green card through marriage. Would it help if he married an immigrant with a visa? Your student visa expires in 10 months. How come you guys always force me to play on the other team? Well I know that one. Because you suck! Fernando! Hey good game guys, Steph, it was really good to have you. I know, it's been a long time. I've been really busy actually. Hey, do you have any like, new models for me so I can check them out? Well, Mr. Fernando, actually it's mostly been business headshots but maybe next time I can have a model for you. - Fuck that. - Fuck that! Oh, he's bored now. He's bored now. What? Tell us your secret man. How'd you land that job? Did you have to fuck anyone? Wow, you're gross man! It's cool, it's cool. It was your brother. Do you want to know how big he is? Fuck you, alright? Asshole. What's wrong with Sebas? He got fired. Oh wow... Is he leaving? He doesn't want to. Do you remember this guy Karl Kurtz? Yeah! That German kid, right? Yeah, he was in my freshman marketing class. He got married with an American girl. That's how he got his green card, right? Yeah I mean, but... She was really desperate man, and he was too. They were like a perfect match together. Hey, do you know other desperate people? Whoa! Didn't know you were interested in trios man! No. Adrian, you're not really serious about this? I'm just asking. Cause they have like a life together and everything, you know. I just, I don't know, I don't think you're supposed to do that with a perfect stranger. Look, how come you don't just marry him? Because I don't have the right visa, I'm not American, I don't have a green card. You and Sebastian are not really serious about this right? Oh, come on Marky... Let the guy have some fun. Okay, what if it works? Yeah, what if it works? I mean, people get married all the time with total strangers they don't love, right? They just don't realize it before it's too late. Look man, don't encourage him to do it. Calm down buddy. We're all adults here, right? It's kinda bullshit. Do you know someone who can help us? I didn't know that was a big story with... Cheers! Sorry! Sorw! Sam? Sam? How many? Sam's was big. I don't want to talk about big cocks. Yeah, I don't want to talk about cocks either. No, please don't! You're jealous! I don't want Sebastian to hear that. Fuck... My head is killing me. I knew it was going to be a rough morning. Why? I wonder why... I don't know. I'm going to make you some soup so you'll start working again. Oh yeah? Then what are you waiting for? I'm dying. Be careful, it's hot. Good? I'm better now. You don't even believe that. Have you done this before? I've set up many people before. I do background checks on everyone. When do you want to get married? In a month or so. Yes. A month? You're joking, right? Why? You have a lot of things to prep to make it seem real. Can you make it work? You mean can you make it work? You have a lot of work to do to sell this in front of an of?cer when the time comes. And the marriage ceremony goes a long way. What do you need from us? Once we agree here on the terms, I'll?nd you someone that works. Then we prep the wedding. Then I'm out. All the other immigration stuff is on you. How early would he be able to apply for his green card? That's a few months. And cost? 20,000. Half upfront, half when it's done. We were told it would be around 10,000. I have to pay the person marrying you otherwise they either don't do it or they call immigration on us. And I'm not doing this for free either. Plus, you're asking for a lot in a little bit of time there buddy. OK. 12,000 then? No one's bargaining here. This is illegal, right? Aren't you afraid of people turning you in? What are you doing? You're not the first one to threaten me. I'm still here. They're not. 20,000. - Did you think about it? - What? It's the best way to get your green card. Alter a few years you get divorced... you can continue with your career... and we can stay together. And what about the $20,000? My parents will help us. Weren't they having financial issues? They always say the same thing. Babe, it's illegal. A lot of people have tried it and they're doing?ne. But not everyone. Why don't we go to Cartagena? No. She's not doing anything. That's what you said last time... and now look at her nose. It's going to take 5 to 10 years. Do you really want to wait that long? No. It's the best option! You'll be able to work here and live with me. - We'll be in New York. - Fine. - But on one condition... Which? It has to be with Stephanie. I think we need more than one option. Who's getting married? So let's do it my way. Okay. Please guys, don't look at them. Please, keep going on. Oh my God. I've never seen these before. No? No, I really like it. - And I like it too. - Yeah. I think she looks like a feather under the water. Just with oozing energy. Why are you laughing? They all look fatter under water. I'm very proud of you. I really like that one. - Which one? - This one. She looks so strong in that picture. - Yeah, that one's nice. - Her eyes. Talking about strong eyes. Wouldn't you like to have a little bit of wine and cheese? - Maybe? - Yeah. Yeah, good. Are your parents coming back to town Adrian? No. Damnit! I mean I'm sorry it has nothing to do with you it's just thatI was really hoping to have some more time with Sebas. You know, movies. Nachos. - Ice cream. - Ice cream, popcorn. Yeah, salsa lessons. - Yes all night. - Salsa lessons! He's a really good teacher. I can tell. I know, I know he is, yeah. Okay guys, here you go. Cheers for that. Is it too much? No, it's perfect. Cheers! Too much- It's nice. So... s93; Yeah. Steph... Yeah? You know about my situation, right? Yeah sure, what's up? Do you remember Karl Kurtz? Karl? This tall guy with curly hair... Curly... Oh yeah, you know I actually went to his wedding, before they moved to LA. He's a nice guy, yeah? That's how he got his green card. Yeah, so? Okay, we were thinking... and it might be Sebas' only way to stay here. Steph... We need your help. Do you really want to do this? Yes... Yes! Okay. Well then I wish you guys... the best. You guys are joking. Steph... What if you help us find someone else? Someone else? What are you talking about? Seriously? Okay, just forget it. It's okay. Sorry. How can I help you here in the kitchen? Drink. Okay, I'm going to drink. I need this drink. Please don't do that. Were you serious about?nding someone else? Yes. What's wrong? We agreed on something else. We agreed on finding a solution. We can talk about this later. What do you think? They're elegant! You look great! Aren't they beautiful? My dad's going to be jealous with all the people checking you out. I hope so... Mom! Let me be naughty. No way! You're not allowed! Mom... What's up? Are you guys still opening the stores in Villavicencio and Ubat?? We're trying to. Hopefully it works out. I was wondering if you could... Could you talk to dad? I was hoping... you could start sending me money again. How's work? How are things? It's tough. It's really expensive and it's only getting worse. I would appreciate your help. It's dif?cult for everyone. Mom... Are you guys doing that bad? I know what this is all about. You're trying to force me to go back to Colombia! Don't speak to me like that! Show me a little respect! Sorry, mom. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's?ne. I'm wondering if you are still looking for a receptionist? Good. Good. Good. Yes just give me address? Mhmm. Mhmm. Four... Five... Nine, okay. Okay, okay. Thank you, yeah! Okay, have a good evening. Thanks! Hey! Guess what? I got you a job! - Really? - Yes! You can start tomorrow. All you have to do is fill out some documents, organize the doctor's agenda, and other stuff you've done before. Thank you babe. For what? You would've done the same for me. What else would you do for me? A lot of things. - Yeah? - Mhmm. We're going to do a lot of things together, right? Lots of things. Like... You're going to run your own company. And... You're going to be a great journalist. And I also think that... you'll run your own children's charity... In Colombia. Or anywhere else in the world. And we're going to travel right? Of course. Remember when... you told me that we would go to the Greek Islands? Yes. But I think I'd prefer Australia. Australia? Yes, Australia. But after we go to the Greek Islands. Australia is also an island. It's a continent within a big island. Uh... Look, this is what I need. First, I need you to organize next week's schedule. Then, separate all the patients' files... based on scheduled appointments or pending prescriptions. Get all that organized. Understood? The doctor just got here. Give me a second before you call the next patient. Doctor! Miss Maria Parker? Hey. I need your social number. Can you please put this away? Of course. With the insured patients? Insured? The third one. I'll see you tomorrow? Yes. 8 am. Isn't it $50? You were late. Okay. - Please be on time tomorrow. - I will be early. Thank you. Bye. So I just get married to you and that's it? No, there are a few interviews with some immigration of?cers. Interviews? You need to prove how you met, when, show some pictures of the wedding, stuff like that. - How long to we have to stay together? - Until he gets his green card. How long is that? A few years I think. Hey... Hey... So listen, I have to go take some photos for this child therapist out in Queens and I thought you might want to come. - Yeah sure. - Sure? Okay. Okay. - So let's meet at Jamaica? - Just give me a few... Yeah, sure, I'll give you a few. I don't like that one... Okay, that one's super. Thanks. Better than that doctor's of?ce? Say a word. Word. Yeah. ...Banana. Banana? Now draw it. Okay. Banana. You know... when I was teaching those kids in Colombia... I would sit them in a circle and give them a new word every day to learn. And they drew whatever the word means in their minds. And when their parents came, they were excited to show what they drew. Well I think my parents would be very excited to see what I drew. It's uh... So Sebas, have you and Adrian ever thought of going back to Colombia? You could be helping those kids over there. It's not that easy. Is it easier sitting in that of?ce? I can't do that to Adrian. Look, I know Adrian's been good to you. You don't owe him anything, and maybe who knows, maybe it could be the best for both of you. Where are the pictures being published? Sebas, he's the one that's lying to his parents. You have nothing to hide. Who's publishing them? Sebas, look I know, I get it, and maybe what I'm just trying to tell you is that now is the time to think about you. - This whole plan is- - Steph, I don't want to talk about this This whole plan is not going to work! There, I've said it. I think you're going to lose everything, Sebas. And- I already did! Steph... I don't want him to go through the same thing I went through with my dad. He wouldn't be able to handle it. - Hello. - Hi Xime! Who is it? It's Sebas! - Hi! - What's up? - It's so good to heard from you. We have to catch up! - Are you still in Cartagena? - Yes. Hey... Hey... Looks like someone had a good day? Yeah! What about you? Not really. I keep having to do other people's work for them, but... Let's have a drink. - What do you think? - Whatever you want. Can we have two glasses of Cabernet Savigion please? - Yes sir. - Thank you. So how are things... at the doctor's of?ce? Look babe, just hang in there. And you know what? I'm going to get Megan to marry you. She owes us big time. Okay? - You know what? - What? Guess who I talked to today. Who? L?yi?? ?353.; - "E| Enano. " - "E| Enano?" And guess what? What? He's getting married! Married?! Yes! He's doing really well working as a lawyer in Medellin. Awesome! He also told me... that one of his clients is looking for a marketing manager. And he also told me... They're also looking for people... Sorry, are you guys ready to order? Not yet, thank you. Yeah I would love to... What are you doing? Well... I thought we could consider... Medellin or Cartagena? But we're already here. We're safe here. But this isn't working for me. Don't say that. We have a plan. We have to follow it. Please... Promise me you'll forget about this. Promise! What? Are you okay? Yeah... Are you sure? Yes. You're acting a bit strange. What happened Marissa? Isn't this what you asked for? The?rst two episodes are supposed to be quick tips about hair cleaning, right? So, what do you think is wrong here? The solution comes too late? And it's too short. Okay, I'll fix it. - Ok. - Listen... I know... this keeps happening, and... is there a way that maybe you could help me out? I wish I could. But I have a lot of stuff to do. It will be fine. What's this? It's not working. Then?x it. She's not right for this. Then help her. I have a lot of things to work on for the presentation. And I have a lot of other projects to worry about. I need someone else. Then ask Richard, Charlotte, or Daniel. We need a real writer. We don't have one. Not again Adrian? Ijust don't hire people out of the blue. It would work for this project. We should try it. Did you have things to do? I have a meeting to go to. So... Hey. I just got here. Where are you? We haven't talked all day. I'm worried. Hey how's it going? - He likes you. - Who? Hey! - I'm sorry. - Good. Drink? Not this again. I'm totally serious. I'm in! Really? No fucking way! Come on man, it's too fucking complicated. Just for a while. I have plans to get out of here. Do you remember when you got kicked out of your apartment? Yeah, I remember. How long did you stay in our place for free? It's the same. What happened? Maybe you'd know if you'd gone. I wasn't feeling well. I called you a bunch of times. Sorry. Who did that? Who? Fucking Megan! I knew it. I could use your help once in a while. As you can see, Hobbs and his people are going to work with us. I'm so proud of this team. Congratulations! And what happened with the multimedia component? Sorry? It's all in video. - And the podcast? - It wasn't for them. Anything you want to say Adrian? - We needed a real writer. - Adrian- - We need a real writer. - Adrian. I told you- I expect you in my office after this meeting. In any case... the next steps we are going to do will be... the deadlines. Okay? Great. What was that? We threw away a good idea. Maybe it wasn't. Get back to work. I'm sorry. Please, Adrian. Hello? "El Enano" called. Who? Alex? Really? That's weird. I thought so too. He told me about a job in Medellin. You have a Skype interview tomorrow? Why are you looking at my phone? You made a promise. I was looking for another solution. We are already have one. It might not work. We can't return. It's too risky. Seriously? I'm looking out for both of us. For both of us? - Then tell them. - What? Tell your parents about us. We're not doing this again. We belong here together. This is our home. We belong here together. This is our home. Hi love. What's wrong? Hi love. What's wrong? Hi morn. Do you know what time it is? Yes. What's wrong sweetheart? Did I wake you? Yes, of course. Yes, of course. I can't sleep. What is it? Adrian... Are you okay? How's dad? Good. Do you want me to wake him? No... Tell me what's going on. Tell me. Sweetie... There's something I want to talk to you about. I'm right here... for anything you need. Sweetie. You're worrying me. You're worrying me. Adrian? Nothing. Are you in trouble? It's nothing. Then why would you call me at this hour? Go back to sleep mom. You can't do that. That's not fair. I'll call you later. Get some sleep. I need some rest too... I'm going to tell your father. Sebas... It's always the same thing. I can't do it like this. You'll never do it. Not like this. Not like this. Hey! - How are you? - Good, you? Good! Are you busy? No. Do you...? Do you want to come in? Yeah, sure. Come. Are those from the other day? Yeah. Sebastian told you? Oh no! Those please no! Those please no! I think it's nice, what do you think? I like it. Have you talked to him? Yeah sure. Listen... I know you said no... I know you said no... and I understand you have your life, your goals, but... He will stay only if you marry him. Can I ask you a question? Yeah, sure. Whose idea was it to come here? Both of us. Okay, cause I thought that... he came here for you. That was... Didn't he? Who cares? What's your point? Don't you think that Sebastia'n cares? Are you going to help us? Adrian, it's... It's not about helping. I mean... Don't you think it could be a great idea if... for once... just for once, you could follow his lead? just for once, you could follow his lead? Okay, you're right. You're right. It was my idea. Yes. I brought him here. and I haven't let him down ever since. and I haven't let him down ever since. So say it. Just admit it! Admit that... you came here because he was willing to give up everything he could have been. I mean. I'm sorry to say it, but... How much do you want? Excuse me? How much do you want? Let's cut the bullshit. Let's get to the point. How much do you want? No, you're not getting it Adrian. I can't help you. At least not like this, okay? Hello guys! My man. Adrian. Mark... What's good? Good. I'm sorry about before. We'll talk later. Come on guys! Yeah I know, I know, I know. We just gotta do something? Do it, shoot! Shoot Fernando, shoot! I'm right here! Hey what the fuck? Dude calm down. - Don't tell me what to do! - Fuck you! - Don't tell me what to do! - Fuck you! What's your problem? Sebastian! Sebastian! - I'm getting my things and going to Steph's. - Where? Hey! Calm down! Yes. Give me a moment. Yes. Give me a moment. - Hello? - Write this down please. 174... 197... Can you hold for a moment? There's a patient. I'm looking for Sebastian. Who? Sebastian Marcos. He doesn't work here anymore. Sorry. Thank you. I need you to send me some Vicodin. 50 mg. The blue boxes. Hey... - How's it going? - Good. Can I... talk to him? Can I... talk to him? Hey. Where are we going? You'll see. It wasn't my fault we got lost. Who was the one who said that... Borjes was better than Sabato. And we had to sit by some tree... talking for a long time until we got lost. - It wasn't a tree. - No? - It wasn't a tree. - No? That's not the point... We had to stay there a long time. And then you started to scream. I had never seen you so scared in my life. Who found our way back? Camilo and Ximena. Camilo and Ximena. Yeah, that's right. It was Camilo and Ximena. Was that really the first time we spoke? Because I thought we were already together in Garcia's class. But in that class I wasn't good enough for you. That's bullshit. You wouldn't even look at me. You wouldn't even look at me. Accept it. Do you remember that time we went camping... and we had to sleep in Camilo's tent. Because the other one was inundated by the rain. We were together already. I remember because you had an ugly green sweater... that I gave you for Christmas. that I gave you for Christmas. I'm really sorry. I'm going to talk to them. If everything goes well... we'll go back. But if it doesn't, would you stay with me? But if it doesn't, would you stay with me? Let's go. Hi... Sebastian Marcos. We met at Adrian's birthday party. You look familiar. How are you? Fine. Can I come in? Yes, of course. Thank you. Where's Adrian? I think he's still sleeping. I was going to make coffee. Do you want some? Yes, thank you. It's cold. Adrian. Adrian, wake up. What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. You certainly did. Why are you still sleeping at this hour? And this mess? I haven't gotten up yet. I'll?x it in a few. Sweetheart, who is this Sebastian? You saw him? Yes. He's a friend who's visiting. It's good he was up. I didn't hear the door. So, are you planning on sleeping all day? I'm up. I'll wait for you outside. Yeah. - Make your bed... - I will. - Give me a second. - Okay Are you dating anyone? Okay. Sorry, Ijust... How's it going man? Didn't you have plans today? Do you know how to get there? The shower's right there. Let me know if you need anything. - Thanks. Excuse me. - Take care. How's everything? Good sweetie. How's dad? Working really hard. He's a machine. Wasn't it expensive to get here? We figured it out. I'm not surprised. I had to see how you were. What's up? This is horrible. Really? You never like anyone's coffee. I don't remember him. You know I didn't either... We went to school together and he wrote to me... to see what I was up to. He told me he was coming to New York... so I told him to stay over. It's been good to catch up. Do a lot of your friends visit? Not really. It's good to see you mom. So you spend a lot of time alone? Everyone here does. And you're happy like that? I'm getting used to it. The other day... I got really worried. I felt like something was going on. So that's why you came. That's how I am. Sweetheart... how is it possible... that such an intelligent and talented young man... could live in such a disastrous place? This is embarrassing. Mom... It's like I didn't teach you anything. Josefa and you spoiled me. How rude! - Isn't it true? - Cut it out. At least help me dry the plates. Okay. Let's clean this mess. Here you go. Remember this morn? You have to let me. Watch it. I'm your mother. Dry the plates. No. It won't hurt you to be clean once in a while. I haven't even taken a shower yet. You have to take care of your house too. I'm really happy you're here. So am I. It's good to see you. I was really worried. It's been a while since you surprised me like that. That's what I do. I know. I can always count on you, right mom? Of course. Anything you need. Then, I think we should talk about some things. What's wrong? A lot of things. Tell me. Where do I start? You remember I called you a few days ago... which is why you're here. I didn't want you to worry. Well... What's wrong? I've been wanting to tell you about... Hold on. Adrian... Tell me what's going on. What if it's important? We'll answer later. Let's just answer now. Adrian, please... - What? - It can wait. What if it's dad? Fine! Answer it then. I knew it. Hi dad! How's everything? Hi Adrian... How's your mother? How are you? Yeah! She's here...
