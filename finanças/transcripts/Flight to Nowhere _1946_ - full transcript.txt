(dramatic music) (car tires screeching) (gun firing) (bomb bangs) (intriguing music) (plane engine whirring) Okay, George, she's all yours. Through for the day, Hobe? I'm through for the weekend and you can sweep out all that rice. Do you realize that in the last 24 hours I've flown four couples up to Las Vegas to get married. Ah, what are you beating about. You make nothing but dough. Yeah, I guess you are right. You know, sometimes I think money isn't everything. That reminds me, I've got to call Murtle. (footsteps clocking) See you later. Okay. Mr. Carrington. You are Hobe Carrington, aren't you? Yeah. Can we go somewhere, where we could talk? I'm listening, go right ahead. I want to charter your plane. Oh, I'm sorry, I'm taking the weekend off. I just told my mechanic to... Yes, I know what you told your mechanic but you see this is very important to me. I have to get to Death Valley. Getting married? Oh no, of course not. Why should you ask? Because all I've been doing is flying the milk run for Cupid. Now I want to relax. Small restaurant, corner table, soft lights, soft music, soft shoulders. Wow, why not have dinner with me? That's the best offer I had today. Where are we going? I have a table reserved in the hotel in Death Valley. Oh, just make it out like I didn't say anything. Oh, I'll pay you well. I'll give you $500, on account. On account? Oh, I'll pay you some more. You see, I might want you to stay there a few days. Now, what about the dinner? You know, I'm just beginning to develop an appetite. By the way, what's your name? Oh, Catherine, Catherine Forrest. Can we leave right away? All right, Miss Forrest. I'll meet you at the plane as soon as I wash up. All right, Hobe. Well, Bob Donovan. I always had a hunch you'll wind up as a washroom attendant but then I supposed it's pretty tough for a tired old ex-Major to find a job these days. What happened? Couldn't you hug those good old planes you used to sport around the China Burma Theater. The same old Hobe. Keeping your eyes and your ears closed and your mouth opened. You haven't change a bit. That's right, the same old Hobe that used to risk his neck for you. Remember the time you dropped me off in a Japanese jungle, and left me there for three weeks to decode messages for you? Sure, you were the best counter espionage agent we had. I could use you right now that is the government could. Oh I'm sorry but we're not going together any more. Don't you remember, I'm a civilian now. We should see me out some night in my new pinstripe uniform. By the way, what are you doing since you got out? Oh, I'm just changing the bones, my jobs. Right now, I'm looking for a man. In here? I'm hoping that you could help me find him. Not a chance. I'm flying charter now. I'm taking a certain young lady up to Death Valley. I'll be too busy to look for mess but if I see it though, I'll let you know. I'll be able to find you here in the office, I presumed. So long. You're all set, George? Just about. Say Hobe, there's a storm coming in. You may have to fly over it. I'll put the oxygen in. Okay. Oh, Miss Forrest. Yes, what is it, I'm Miss Forrest. You're Miss Forrest? I thought... Oh hello, Mr. Carrington. You seemed merely to confuse. This is Miss Catherine Forrest. I used her name because mine is too hard for people to remember. I'm the Countess Maria de Fresca. Anyway, this is quite all right with you, isn't it, dear? Oh why, of course. And who are these other people, chaperons? Oh these are your other passengers. Mr. Van Bush, Mr. Forrest and Mr. Porter. This is our pilot, Mr. Carrington. How do you do, sir? Hello, how are you? I'm afraid we may have to fly over some weather. What does that mean? Might have to use oxygen. Maybe we better not go then, Cathy. Oh what's the difference, let's get going. I never used oxygen, I... That's all right, you'll be sitting in front with me. I'll take care of you. It sounds rather frightening. What, sitting with me or using oxygen? Well, maybe I try them both and find out. You know, oxygen is not at all bad. I used it overseas. As a matter of fact, it's quite exhilarating. Really? Yes. I still don't like the idea of all the company. But we're having dinner together. Are there any special seating arrangement planned? Miss Forrest, I mean, the Countess is sitting up front with me. You can make yourselves comfortable any place you like. Thanks. Here's the weather report, Hobe. Oh, here's something else that just came. So long. Happy landing. (plane engine whirring) Hey Porter. What? I thought you were going to watch the scenery. Oh, yes indeed, I wouldn't miss it for the world. How did you happen to pick me for this trip? Oh you were the only charter pilot available. What do you mean the only one available? Well all the other ones were booked up solid for the weekend. It must be quite a thrill to be able to handle a plane like you do. Do you flying long? Few years. You were a flier during the war? Uh-huh. Why didn't you tell me you were bringing a whole party of people? Oh really, it was sort of dreamed up at the last moment. You might have trouble getting accommodations at the hotel. They're usually booked up in advanced. Oh, I'm sure we'll be able to find something. What's the matter? I don't know, it's looking out and down, it seems to bother me. That you feel alone? No, I think I better go back and sit in the cabin. Oh Cathy, would you change places with me? Why sure, I'd love to. Oh Cathy, let me sit there. I'd be glad to sit up here, Cathy. I don't mind it at all. But I want to sit in the cockpit, Jan. Look mister, you can't stand up front. Jan, why don't you go back and keep Mr. Porter company. He doesn't need any company, he's fast asleep. You know the only one that I can lay my hands on is what I get from Cathy? I've stuck with whatever dad left me. What about the money you made during the war? What money? In a Japanese prison camp on the forsaken island in the Pacific? You've been telling that story so often, Claude there, I think you're beginning to believe it yourself. Right, I'll give you some money tonight when we get to Death Valley. What altitude are we flying at? At 14,000. You should have put on your oxygen mask. You go back to your seat and fasten your safety belt. We might get some rough weather. Tell the rest of the people to put on their oxygen masks. (plane engine whirring) Why didn't you tell me you couldn't take oxygen? I didn't know. What are you trying to do? Keep your hands off her. Sit down. You can't talk to me that way. I'll talk anyway I like, I'm flying this plane. Yes, and you're responsible to what happens to your passengers. It wasn't even connected. Gotta be super negligence. You probably kicked it loose when you were up here before. Maybe Liz kicked it loose. Anyway this is not the time to talk about it. We're coming in to Death Valley. Mr. Carrington is right, this is no place to start an argument. Sit down, Van Bush. (plane engine whirring) How do you feel, Miss Forrest? A little woozy but I'll be all right. I'll take care of her. Mr. Carrington, are you sure that oxygen hose was connected before we took up? Of course, everything was inspected. What do you expect him to say, Liz? Look mister, you're asking for it, aren't you. Gentlemen. This won't do anybody any good. We're safely here. I don't think Cathy will suffer any ill effects. Well, it isn't his fault if she isn't. Oh stop, Claude, I'm all right. Yes, it seems to me, we're all been rather tired. Come on my dear, let's go to the hotel. What about our luggage? The pilot will bring it. (suitcase thuds on the floor) Can I give you a hand, sir? Yeah, thanks. (car engine whirring) (car doors clank shut) I still say it is the pilot's fault. Oh forget it, Jan. I think he's rather nice and so does Cathy, don't you dear? Really, I didn't notice him too much. Will you see about the reservations please, Claude? Sure thing. You have reservations for the Forrests, the Countess de Fresca Maria, Gerald Porter, and Jan Van Bush. I'm sure we have. Hello Countess. Oh hello, Cathy. Hello Mr. Walker. Oh I'm sorry, this is Mr. Porter. How do you do, Mr. Walker? And how do you do, Mr. Porter? I should thank you too, Mylin and Janace would know each other. Where have you operated mostly, Mr. Walker? To tell the truth, I haven't operated much since the war. Well excuse me. Yes. Mr. Van Bush, Mr. Walker. - How do you do? - How do you do? And this is our pilot, Mr. Carrington. I'm glad to know you. Glad to know you. Would you excuse me, I have a long distance call. Where's our luggage? Well, I was going to bring it up but I didn't have my union cards so I let the bellboys do it. Oh, we've been trying to get you a room, Mr. Carrington but they're pretty full. You see, we had our reservations here for some time. Oh that's all right, just put me up in the service quarters. We managed to get Mr. Carrington a room. Here's your key, sir. Thanks. Well, what about that dinner we planned, with the soft lights and the music. Was that out? Well, we have been invited to be Mr. Walker's guests but why don't you come to my room for a cocktail after I freshen up? All right. See you later then. Hello, hello. Give me the manager please. This is Mr. Van Bush speaking, I have a complaint to make. Somebody has been going through my luggage. Yes. I want a thorough investigation. Hello, superman. I'm not surprised. You didn't think you can get away from me that easy, did you? I intended to be down here while you arrived, and I intend to stay here. You mean we are roommates? No, neighbours. Bob, let's stop this cops and robbers shall we? Too late now, why do you think that you're the only charter plane available? That's why I got a room in a crowded hotel? That's right. Tell me did anything important happen on the way down? I'll say it did. Somebody kicked the oxygen tube loose on my plane. Catherine Forrest was almost killed. I'd have been grounded for life. Only this trip you were on, has fallen off on the pleasure zone. It's a dangerous mission. Anytime that you get into nice, our racketeers exploiting and try to get at you. Anything can happen. Why do you have to pick me for this job? I did not do your dirty work overseas. Because you're the only one I can trust. That's very flattering. But I don't like being dragged in this way. Tell me what's all this squawk about Van Bush, things about you went through his luggage. Did you find anything suspicious? Yeah, he wears silk underwear. (Bob laughs) Cathy. Yes. Would you do me a favor? How much is it this time? I need $2,000. $2,000? What on earth for? Look, do I have to explain every time I need a little money? But Claude, this can't go on. I've been giving you so much money these last few weeks. Okay, put me through the usual third degree. Would you care to join me? No, this is business. You came with me from Honolulu that you have some information on Claude Forrest. That's why I sent for you. Would you be interested in selling that information? Why, Tom, what a question? How much? I think you'll find me generous enough. You know, I have it right here but tell me, why do you want it? That shouldn't concern you. Let's just say, I don't want to see it getting to the wrong hands. This must be the last. All right, but I don't know why you have to be so stingy. After all, it's just as much my money, as it's yours, even though dad did leave it to you. I'm not stingy, Claude. It's just that I can't afford to spend... Oh forget it. Come on, let's get downstairs. They're most likely waiting dinner for us. All right, I'll be with you in a minute. Hobe, you gotta get the proper perspective. When international cartels start to worry, the life of a human being isn't very important. You think Catherine Forrest looks like the type that will be mixed up in an international cartel? I didn't say that but I did check on the Forrests. They gave a house party in Honolulu, and one of their guests was a Korean, was delivering a certain map of a South Pacific island to one of our agents. Well, he never got there, he was killed and the map was never found. How does that tie in on the rest of the party? Because every passenger on your plane was a member of that house party. Boo-hoo, suspect. It's anybody's guess. Whom do you suspect? What about the countess? Well I'll be able to tell you more about the countess in a couple of minutes but it might not be what you want to know. I still think you should tell me why you want this information on Claude? Look Liz, it's none of your business. You're not giving it to me, I'm buying it and I'm willing to pay a good price. Do you have the money with you? I'll get it after dinner. That reminds me, I better be getting downstairs. Yes and I should get ready too. We'll get together later this evening. Pardon me. Hello countess. I'm glad you're at home. Good evening, Mr. Carrington. Do sit down. Thank you. Are all you foreign women two-fisted drinker. No, the second one is for you. Right, martini and warm too. Now that we are alone. I want to tell you something. I'm very frightened. Of me? No, of course not. About what happened in the plane this afternoon. You mean the business about the oxygen? Yes. That was meant for me. You remember I was sitting up front with you. That's right, why should anyone want to kill you? Oh it's rather involved. You see, I was born on the continent that, I went to an English finishing school, and then I married the count, and when he died, he left me some rather valuable properties. There are certain people who are trying to get those properties. I'm very frightened. Don't be frightened but who are these people? Could be anybody on the plane today. Will you, will you help me? I always said there's nothing like those English finishing schools. You will help me, won't you? Sure, but who's going to help me? Well should we go downstairs? You go ahead, I'll join you later. I hope you're not too disappointed about not having the dinner we planned. No, it's a funny thing, I just lost my appetite. But I'll see you later. (object thuds on back of head) Mr. Carrington. What happened? I don't know, I was out at the time. You sure you haven't been drinking? Yeah a martini. Morning now have to prove it. Okay, can I help you? No, it's all right, I can do it all right. I'll see you later. Bartender. What'll it be? A double martini. A double? Yeah, one martini gave me this headache, maybe two will make it go away. Yes, sir. I've been looking for you Carrington. Get lost. I see that you've been going through my luggage. Go away and start all over again. I'm serious, I demand an explanation. Why don't you start explanaing how you happen to kick the oxygen hose loose in my plane? Look, if you're trying to cover up your own negligence by blaming me for that accident, you're talking to the wrong guy. It so happens that I intend to marry Miss Forrest. Oh, I'll send her my condolences in the morning. Right now, I don't feel so well. Don't try to change the subject. Why did you go through my luggage? Look, I've taken all I'm going to from you, you open your yap once more, I'll close for you. Oh yeah, I'd like to see you try that. Don't get up boys. Is this drink for me or do I have to buy myself one? Why don't Cathy come down here Jan? I haven't seen her. Well please be a good boy, and go and call her room, and go tell her we're waiting for her. I called your room and there was no answer so I was downstairs to see if I could find you. Could we go outside and talk? I've been outside. The desert air seemed to knock me right off my feet. You mean you were attacked? Oh, we can't talk here. I'm afraid we'd be overheard. Now maybe you understand why I'm so frightened. First it was Cathy, now it's you. You haven't anything to worry about. As long as I don't run out of customers. Oh I thought you meant what you said that, that you'll help me. Sure, sure I'll help you. What did you find in Jan's luggage? Why would I want to go through Jan's luggage? Oh I thought maybe Claude or Cathy put you up to it. You see, I'm suspicious of everybody except you. Lovely. We've been looking all over for you. Really? I just sent Jan to call your room. Let's all have a drink shall we? Hope your head's feeling better, Mr. Carrington. Oh sure. Oh Mr. Walker, but I seemed to be the first one of your guests to arrive. Oh I guess the others will be along presently. As we know all along, I'm always the one on time to eat. The others never seem to get hungry plus I took time out for a quick swim, and I wished I had time for a horseback ride over the desert, greatest exercise in the world. Oh, you sound like you spent most of your time outdoors. I have, all my life. I've engineered in practically every country. I understood Cathy said you were in the mining business. Well, geological engineering. Practically the same thing. I find the valuable minerals and let the other fellow make the money out of it. (Tom Walker laughs) It looks like I was having a wild goose chase. They told me to call your room. Oh I'm here, Jan. Hobe, Hobe darling. Well Irene. Well this is the most pleasant surprise I've had in weeks. Oh really? Oh this is the Countess de Fresca, Maria. How do you do? Miss Forrest. How do you do? Mr. Van Bush. How are ya? And Miss Forrest's brother, Mr. Forrest. How do you do? Miss Allison is an old friend of mine. Yes indeed. As a matter of fact, we were more than just friends. I used to be Mrs. Carrington. That I'm sure you two must have a great deal to talk over. Will you excuse me? Yes, come Cathy, will you excuse us Miss Allison. Thank you. Well, what's the matter? Why are you staring at me like that? Because a lot of funny things have happened to me today. Oh but Hobe, this isn't funny, this is wonderful. Would you like to go for a walk in the garden with me? Why didn't you let me know you were back? What do you mean, let you know? I didn't know where to find you. Besides I didn't think you were interested in hearing from me. The last letter I got from you, I read in a bomb shelter. It's funny how clear it seems. Please sign the enclosed papers, I want a divorce. I spent the whole night with the chaplain talking about it. I know, I'll regret it all my life. You don't regret it, you got married right away didn't you? Oh you mean Reggie. But Hobe you were gone so long and Reggie was in a position to do me so much good. After all he was backing my show. Sure, sure, so what are you doing here? Well I, I established residence in Las Vegas. I just slipped out here for the weekend. I'm getting a divorce. It's your plot huh. Yes it was all Reggie's fault. Just because I met Gregory Lawrence. He's a Hollywood producer, and in a position to do me so much good. Reggie's pretty narrow-minded isn't he? Yes, isn't he? But enough of that. Oh Hobe, this is wonderful, this is like old times. We can have the whole weekend together. You can turn on and off just like that, can't you? Well Hobe, I don't know what you mean. I'll skip it. Anyway I'm working. I've got a chartered flight for the countess. The countess? Yeah you met her when you came in. Oh that. Why, she's no more of a countess than I am. I met her in show business before I met you. She went by the name of Dolly Lorraine. You know what you're talking about? Certainly, she and I worked in an act with Tamburini The Great. We were his assistants. The last time I saw her, she was being sawed in half. You didn't say anything about that when you met her. Of course not. I may be a cat, but I'm not that catty. She wants to make like she's a countess, that's her right to be. Excuse me a minute. Will be right back. What's new? Bobby, a lot of things have been happening. What happened? Not important things like me getting hit on the head. Anyway I got it. You got what? What you've been looking for. I got it from the countess. How do you like that? What was it? It's an envelope. It had a lot of papers in it written in Japanese. You mean to say, you had it, and you lost it? Yeah. I've been losing a lot of things and they're all connected with you. For instance? For instance, I've just bumped into Irene, the ex Mrs. Carrington. She might not have been Mrs. Ex, if you'd had given me that leave I asked for, when she wanted a divorce. You think that would have helped any? Maybe not. It doesn't Hobe. I wished I could get you to realize that that the job we're doing now might be just as important as fighting a war. That we might keep other men from going through what we went through. Leaving their wives... Okay, you can stop waving the flag. I won't back out. Just burns me to think somebody could make me for that alcohol. Who made you for it? I'm just wondering. You think you have a chance in getting it back? That's possible. I'll see you later. Good luck. Irene, were you on a level about the countess? Of course, I think it was the summer before I met you. Tamburini was looking for some girls to work the audience, you know, pull things out of women's purses. It was always good for laugh. Yeah, yeah, I bet it was. Anyway, I was in the act when she came. I taught her the routine. You know, you could do me a favor. Let's have dinner, we'll talk it over. Oh I want to compliment you on a delicious dinner, Mr. Walker. Oh thank you. I've eaten all over the world, and I think that's probably the was the most enjoyable meal I've ever had. Well I think I'll be nice having our coffee out here on the terrace. Incidentally I have some excellent brandy. Wonderful. What do you say, countess? I would love it. If you give me a few moments to repair the ravages of dinner. What about you Cathy? Cathy and I are gonna take a walk. Yes it is a beautiful night. Excuse me. We've been here for hours now. When are we going to get down to business? Oh countess. Yes? You must have thought I've been dreadfully rude this evening. Well I... I stared so terribly. For a moment, I thought you were someone I knew but then I realized how stupid that was. I mean 'cause the girl I knew was the goaler and... I'll see you later. Yes dear. Probably shouldn't drink that coffee. Keep me awake, nights. You must have taught her the routine. Is that what you wanted? Looks like Egyptian hieroglyphics to me. Well it's a love letter I wrote to her mummy once and she was going way over my head. (Irene laughs) Will you excuse us, Mr. Porter. We have some business to discuss. Oh certainly, certainly. I'll just sit here and enjoy the desert air. You know, I'm kind of glad Gregory got tied up at the last minute. Was he going to meet you here? Yes, that's why I came down from Las Vegas. This is much better. Let's go story. Let's forget about everything. Including Greg? Everything and everybody. Well, aren't you coming in? I told you I have some unfinished business. Oh can't it until tomorrow? Look, we've been separated for over four years. You seemed to get along all right without me. Now Hobe Carrington, you know very well that it wasn't all my fault. After all, you didn't have to go and enlist. You could have waited 'til they drafted you. You have things all figured out, haven't you? But of course. How I just love it here. You can sit. Well, how nice. Where is everybody? Oh, Claude and Mr. Walker have gone to talk over some business. You've known Mr. Walker for some time, haven't you? Yes, I met him in Cairo several years ago. Really? Very forceful man, Mr. Walker. Claude isn't in any trouble, is he? Oh not that I know of, why? Oh I just think his nervousness is due to more than the war. I don't like to see Claude get mixed up with the wrong people. You mean Mr. Walker is... I don't know. But something's going on. I don't like what happened to Cathy this afternoon. No, I don't either. It's getting chilly here. I think I'll get a wrap. Don't get up. Listen Claude, there's no use trying to high pressure me. I'm not ready to do business yet. When I am, you will know about it. Well if you want to do it, it's going to be tonight. What's the rush? You know what the rush is. I need money, and if you're not willing to do it, I know someone who is. As a matter of fact, he's waiting for me in Las Vegas now. I don't invest a quarter of million dollars without considering every angle. You will never get it any cheaper. No. Oh, Jan, I appreciate the way you feel about me but, oh I just don't intend to have you routine my life. You'd be a lot better off if I routine it instead of that good for nothing brother of yours. Jan. And he's not the only one. That woman who calls herself a countess, and Porter. As for Walker, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could see him. Jan, I will not have you insulting my friends. But it's quite all right for that uncouth pilot Carrington to insult me. Ex-wives trailing him while he's drooling over the countess and you. I'm sure Mr. Carrinton's private life is no concern of mine. Hello. Where's Claude? He just left. He said he was going back into the hotel. Are we ready to do business? I guessed so. Have you the document with you? Have you the? Well? Why the little... I mean it Cathy. You're a silly goose and you need someone to look after you. And you've appointed yourself my custodian. Yes, you know of anyone better? Jan please. Cathy. Jan, stop, stop it. There you heard what the lady said. The lady said stop. What is this, it seems to me you're always butting in where you're not wanted. Yeah, I didn't see the welcome mat roll out for you. Carrington, I only know of one way to deal with you. (body splashes into pool) Don't worry, it's the shallow end. You'll pay for this, Carrington. I'm not usually the Sir Galahad type but you seemed to be giving away an awful lot of weight. You barely had a busy evening, haven't you? What with the countess, me, ex-wives coughing up. Oh, Irene? Still in love with her? Lately, I've been wondering whether I ever really was in love with her. For now, I thought so. How long has it been, since you seen her? About four years. She divorced me while I was overseas. Oh that's terrible. When I get married, it will be for keeps. You look like the type that would. Of course I'll make sure I love him before I marry him. That left Jan out, doesn't it? Oh, he knows I don't love him. Shall we go in? No thanks, I think I'll stay outside a while and smoke the cigarette. Then I'll say good evening. It's very nice talking with you, Mr. Carrington. It would have been nicer if you said Hobe. I've been noticing this ring. It's very interesting. Family crest? No, it was Claude's. He brought it back from the orient, and when he got home, he had it cut down, and gave it to me. There's quite an oriental legend connected with it though. Really, you must tell me about it some time. I will. But first I must find out what it is from Claude. He hasn't told me yet. Good night, Hobe. Good night. (back of gun thuds on the head) As I remember, you take guan-lung. I don't know, it's two lunch. Oh thanks, eh what happened? Well I found you lying out on the terrace last night. When you sent my key up to me, I decided I wanted to have a little talk with you. When I found you, you were in no condition to talk. How did you get me up here? I brought the bellboy. I told him you were drunk. Say what's going on, Hobe? I wish I knew. Did it have something to do with that letter? How do you like that, it's gone again. Well, I've got to get back to the room. Thanks for the use of the hall. Don't thank me. I've been waiting ya, surprised you weren't in the room. What happened to ya? Somebody rapped me in the head. What again? Yeah. Listen Hobe, I've got to leave. That's why I want to see you. From now on, keep your eyes and your ears open, will ya, and stay on your feet. I wanna know what's happening. Look Donovan, I wished you could fix this so I could stay on my feet. I might be able to tell you what's happening but I can't see very well while I'm lying flat on my back. Well you better get downstairs, the sheriff wants to see you. The sheriff? Yes, murder investigation. Walker was killed last night, stabbed to death. I gotta leave. Hey, whose side are you on? The medical examination shows that Walker was killed between 11 and 12 last night. You all admit you weren't in your rooms but yet not one of ya can prove where you've been. I was on the veranda if anyone cared to look. Yeah, yeah, I know. I've got to get back to that wet suit, Mr. Van Bush. After all, Walker was found in the rock pool. Yeah but I fell in the swimming pool. That's right, sheriff, Mr. Van Bush stumbled. Oh Mr. Carrington can verify that, can't you Hobe? Mr. Carrington, I'm glad you're here. I'm glad you're glad. What do you want to see me about? We'll get back to that. By the way, you weren't in your room all night, where were ya? Well I was. He was with me. You see, Mr. Carrington and I used to be married. We were talking about a reconciliation. (phone rings) Excuse me, I'll get that. Hello. Yes, it's Sheriff Bradley. Fine. You have? They'll be interested to know that. Bye. Well, I don't have to detain you folks any longer, they found the murderer. - Oh well, I can get dressed. - Oh, that's wonderful. Who was it? The fella that's been bothering Walker ever since he's been here for money. He signed a confession. Oh, let's find that stairs. Excuse me. Mr. Carrington, will you get the plane ready right away? We are leaving for Las Vegas. Las Vegas. Yes, you could expect me to stay after what happened to poor Tom Walker? You know you had a narrow escape up there in the veranda. Why, what do you mean? I got hit on the head again. By the way, something very valuable was taken from me last night. Oh really? And I'll stop at nothing to get it back. You know countess, if I were you, I wouldn't trust myself up in a plane with me. Why, why not? 'Cause I'm tired of getting hit on the head all the time. Oh Carrington, I understand we're leaving. It's a good thing too after what happened to that poor chap Walker. Yeah. I've heard a lot of nice things about Las Vegas. Now that I can see them. Great place for sweeping. Yes, what? Oh. Oh just a minute, Mr. Carrington. I got quite a collection of these labels. I got some very valuable ones there too. It's Exeter in London. Completely demolished during the war. There's Singapore, there's Shepheard Hotel in Cairo, Shanghai, oh here's a fun little place in Japan. I bet you've never even heard of it. I can't even make it out myself. It's a Sabe on their cherry festival. That's pretty good, you must have flown in the orient. Yeah, well let's get going. Hobe. Hobe. You certainly got to take me to Las Vegas, could you. I can't stand this place another minute. I'm afraid that's out of room. I even have pilot. Oh, don't have to look so smug about it. I always could fly as well as you. My license is right up to date. I'm sorry, Irene but the plane is chartered. It's quite all right, Miss Allison. Thank you. Okay, excuse me. (plane engine whirring) (car engine whirring) (footsteps clocking) By the way, Mr. Carrington, I believe we have many unfinished business. You mean about the dinner with the soft lights and... Oh I mean the letter that your ex-wife stole from me last night. May I have it? Supposed I told I didn't have it. I wouldn't believe it. Well I haven't. All right, Carrington, what's your price? Listen sister, that might be your racket, but it's not mine. Why, you insulting little... Just a minute, Dolly Lorraine. I'm tired of being pushed around by you and your playmates. You can take a commercial plane from here. I'm leaving. Well, that's the first decent break we've had so far. We made a bargain with Carrington, he won't go until he's dismissed. I'm sure Mr. Carrington's bargains are no better than his words. I for one am not surprised that his loose code of ethics. There's nothing wrong with my code of ethics. As far as I'm concerned, you're no bargain. Mr. Carrington, your attitude is insulting. Have you forgotten that your contract is not... Stick this on your suitcase. What's the matter, no room? There's not enough room in this whole town for that bunch of means. Mr. Carrington. Thanks. Excuse me, madam. Where are you going now? There's somebody else I've got to tell off. I don't care what you say, Donovan. I've had enough. I don't mind being insulted, and having my pockets picked. I'll even go for one slight bash in the head but when it gets to be a habit. On top of that, I was questioned for murder. Now where were you when all those was happening to me? I was arranging for someone to be booked for the murder. What do you mean arranging? He confessed, didn't he? He's been confessing the murders for the last 10 years. That's what we pay him for. And you let the murderer get away? Right here to Las Vegas. The man that killed Walker is gonna lead us to the map, and the people connected with it. But Mr. Ruehl, this uranium deposit may prove to be one of the richest in the world. That was proven by the tests that the Japs made. Then not, why didn't the Japs develop it? It's impossible. Our bombers wouldn't let them. You see the whole thing is submerged in shallow water off an atoll. It's impossible to find. Then how do I know that you can find it? Because I have the map. The only map. What's the price of this map? Uranium isn't cheap, Mr. Ruehl. That's what atomic bombs are made of. We knew the countess was a phony and that murder verifies our suspicions about Claude. Sure he was working with some kind of an engineering firm in East Indies. When the Japs invaded, he made a deal with them. The Japanese were working on atomic energy then. What they needed was uranium. He was a valuable man to them. Claude had told me about the Japanese prison camp. Imagine them letting him run around with a valuable gold ring while they rob you blind, the minute you get there. A ring, what kind of a ring? Strange oriental affair, you know, with blue and stars. Supposed to have kind of a legend connected with it. Well I've got to shove off... Wait a minute, wait a minute. You're not going anywhere. Who says I'm not? You're gonna stay around here, and find out about that legend. Thank you sir. Mr. Ruehl, the best business deal you ever made. Thank you Claude, just what I needed. Liz. The Countess de Fresca Maria, Mr. Ruehl. How do you do, Mr. Ruehl? I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Oh by no means, please join us. Claude, I didn't know you had friends in Las Vegas. Mr. Ruehl has a ranch up here that he uses to breed horses. Oh, so you breed horses, Mr. Ruehl. Oh, it must be a fascinating business. Well, it's really not my business. If I had my way, I'll spend all of my time at my ranch. Countess, Claude. Hello. I was just going for a ride. Mr. Porter, Mr. Ruehl. Mr. Porter is a member of our party. How do you do, sir? How do you do, definitely? Mr. Ruehl, if you're acquainted around here, perhaps you can tell me somewhere where they have some good saddle horses. Mr. Porter, you're in luck. I was just telling the countess about my ranch. It's only eight miles from town. Is that so? I breed saddle horses. Well. Oh I've got mighty spirited animals sports. Be glad to have you ride in the morning. Thank you very much. Come on, I'll call my ranch and tell you'll be coming. That's very generous of you, Mr. Ruehl. You're doing me a favor. They need exercise. Claude, and countess. Please join me for cocktails later, will ya? We'll be delighted. And you have to butt in for. I told you I'll get you some money. Claude, I have been a fool, trying to get some money from you. In fact, we've been both fools working against each other. What do you mean? The map you were trying to sell Ruehl. Listen... Oh, save your breath. I know what you were up to with Walker. You see Claude, you don't trust the right people. Walker wanted to buy that letter from me so that he could get the map from you at his own price. You mean you tried to double-cross me by selling that letter to Walker? I ought to slap that silly smirk right off your face. What difference does it make who double-crossed who? We could have done the same thing as Walker tried to. Buy my information, and trade it to you from your map. All these because you refused to confide in me. Now, are we partners? (ice cubes knocking on glass) Mr. Carrington. I'd like to talk with you. I even went out to the airport to find you. Jan is still waiting at your plane. If he fools around with that plane, I'll... He's waiting to apologize. I had a talk with Miss Allison last night, and she told me what happened to you. I'm sorry. That's all right. Think nothing of it. All you got to is watch his mouth, and don't pull him up too fast. All right, fine. Say Mr. Ruehl has a very interesting layout here. He says he breeds horses too. Yes, sir, we cross Quarter Horse stallions with thorough-bred mares and get some mighty fine saddle horses. We got a beautiful stallion in there now but he's wild and vicious. Oh really? Yes, sir. (horse neighs) Hey, look out there, good boy, good boy. Didn't I tell you we had a wild stallion in there? Well that's a man-killer. We can't get a man around here to hail it. Oh is that so? Yes, sir. Well I hope you haven't got any man-killing instincts. Oh, don't worry, he'll give you a nice ride. Ride down the gate there, and you can turn left. Oh is that the trail that goes by the airport? Oh about four mile down. Oh, that's fine, it's just a nice ride. Thanks very much, come on boy. Okay, boy. To the airport please. (car engine whirring) Why, I've know this for years. She practically live with me all during the war. You see, I had a house in Honolulu. You stayed there for the duration? Yes. Liz was wonderful, the way she helped entertained the troops. Yes, I can believe that. And Porter, is he an old friend of the family? Why yes, how did you know? I'm psychic that way. He's certainly been very nice to us. You're right about Claude coming home from the prison camp. He came to see us, said he was an old friend of dad's and if there's anything he could do. Well. Mr. district attorney, any more questions? Yes, when are you going to tell me the oriental fairy tale about this ring? Oh I'm sorry, I forgot to ask Claude about it again. Well, let's make up our own story. Let's see there's a moon and a star, and a date. That reminds me, what are you doing tonight? Oh, nothing. You know this is all right. It's kind of fun being alone like this. Well, I wouldn't call it being alone with all these people around. Well at least we're not being followed by Jan, Claude or the countess, or Porter. Or an ex-wife. Hobe. Hobe, you've got to help me, I'm in a jam. I'm sorry Irene, not tonight. I'm all out of things to do for other people. Now look, I helped you out last night when you asked me to... Excuse me, I'll be back in a minute. (casino crowd chatters) All right, now what do you want this time? Gregory Lawrence just called me from Death Valley, made it after all. Good for Greg, I know he'd make it. Oh be serious, I want you to fly down there, and pick him up. If that's your idea of being serious, you can count me out. Oh then let me take your plane. I won't hurt it. I'm still not serious. That's a fine way to treat me after I stole that letter for you last night. Oh, here you are. Shall we join the others? Delighted. Say, how do you think you'd be at stealing a ring? Don't change the subject. I was talking about... You want to borrow my plane though, don't you? All right. Good girl. (casino crowd chatters) 110. Countess, don't you move from my side. You're bringing me luck. Oh, I won it there, wonderful. Did you? Yeah. I'm so sorry. You have to excuse Miss Allison, she stumbled. It's quite all right. I'll call the airport. Tell them you're on your way. No wonder people go around beating you over your head. Well, here it is. Good, where did you get it? Stop asking questions. I don't mind telling you, I feel like a first class thief. A lot of things you have to do, you don't like going to get your job done. What bothers me are the things I have to do to get your job done. (casino crowd chatters) What about the deal with Ruehl? I'll settle everything. When does he pay us? Tonight. I'll see you in your room in 15 minutes. My ring. What about it? It's gone. You sure you wore it tonight? Of course, I always wear it. Claude. Claude. Look Cathy, don't bother me, I'm busy. But I. Look you forgot your chips, want me to cash them for ya? Thanks old boy, I'll do as much for you sometime. Mr. Ruehl, if you have some business to attend to, go right ahead, I'll play for you. I've been bringing you luck tonight. Thank you, I'll be back shortly. Mr. Carrington, if you don't mind. Cathy, there are a lot of things I'd like to talk to you about. Telephone call for you, Mr. Carrington. Okay. Excuse me, I'll be... Back in a minute, I know. Hobe, Hobe, just a minute. Where's Miss Forrest? I just left her. What do you want with her? Plenty, the ring that you said belong to her is the map I've been looking for. Mr. Carrington, your call is still on the line. Just a minute. Hello. Yes this is Carrington. What? You got a car, Donovan? Yes, why? Irene just crashed at the airport. Crashed? (door knocks) Hello, Mr. Ruehl. You seemed surprised, expecting someone else? I didn't expect it's you. By the way, what did you think of my horses? Oh they were good, they were very good. But I didn't come here to talk about horses. Sit down, Mr. Ruehl. Are you interested in uranium? Well. World sources of atomic power. Then you are well interested in strategic metals. Let me see, it was bauxite in South America, tungsten in Borneo, now uranium. It seems that you've made a considerable amount of my business, your business. Investigating agents of international cartels is my business. I'm not a rat. Every businessman who tries to make an honest dollar is accused to being part of an international cartel. You and I both know that no one ever made and honest dollar in the international cartel, and so Ruehl, our government fully intents that that map will not fall into their hands. What map? The map Claude Forrest is trying to sell to you. It's my duty to warn you that we've been fully informed as to just how deeply involved you are in this. (phone rings) If that's Claude, I'll tell you what to say. Hello. Yes. Claude, this is Ruehl. Yeah. Why can't I come to your room? Come out to your ranch? I'll find it. I assumed that you rather we take Forrest into custody out on your ranch than here in this room. There might be some unpleasantness. It's all right. You government men think about it. Oh just one more thing, Ruehl. There's a plane leaving at 11:40. I know what you mean. You never know what happened. Now that's any consolation. That was no accident. It's a pure case of sabotage. Why would they want to kill Irene? Because she knew the countess was a phony? They didn't want to kill Irene. It was you they wanted. They thought you were taking off tonight. You know that every member of that party was at this air field, one time or another, this afternoon. Not Cathy. I don't believe, she'd have anything to do with it. We'll soon find out. Let's go to the hotel. (door knocks) Come in. I brought you some bad news. I lost all your money. Oh forget it, that was nothing. Where's Claude? Claude, why? He hasn't been here. Then why are you leaving? Well. Okay, unpack your thing. Countess, if you say that I've got the map. Mr. Ruehl, we're wasting our time. I expected Claude to double-cross me but not you. Countess, but just listen. I haven't got the map. He wasn't here. Come on in, Claude. It's all right. Did Ruehl tell you? Ruehl tell me what? Give me that map. I don't know what you're talking about. The one you've been trying to sell Ruehl. Look, I've gone through a lot of bother to get that. After all traveling around country with you for six weeks is not my idea of a pleasure joy. I have a letter that you want. Did Liz sell you that? No, Walker had it. You mean you took it from Walker? He was entirely in a position to hand it to me. Here, take it and read it. Come on over here where the lights are better. Over here by the stool. (thuds in horse stall) What's the matter with that horse? Oh, nothing Claude, nothing. Just a wild horse, he's a killer. I'm getting out of here. You're not going anywhere, if you didn't give me that map. You wouldn't dare use that gun. Everybody will know that you shot me. They find you in that stall, it would look like an accident, wouldn't it? All right, Mr. Ruehl. Make that two tickets. If I can't watch Claude, at least I can keep an eye on you. I'll meet you at the lobby. But I tell you, I haven't got the map. You have to have it. A while out in the islands, I thought Van Bush had it but he's only a porkin, now trying to marry Cathy. Then I suspected the countess, up until last night. But she wouldn't have tried to sell Walker the letter, she'd have sold him a map, so. So I still haven't got the map. Give me that map. I haven't got it, Cathy's got it. It's her ring, I'll get it for you tomorrow. Call her up. No. Call her up right now. Do as I tell you. Uh-huh. Yes, yes of course. I'll be there right away. All right dear. Who was that? It was Claude. He wants me to go out to Mr. Ruehl's ranch. Cathy, I forbid you to go. Oh, stop it. But Cathy, you'll never get Claude to stand on his own feet if you don't stop tagging after him. Jan, will you please leave me alone. Oh but Cathy. Oh Liz, you must do something for me. Will you have a talk with Cathy? Oh not now, Jan, please not now. (car tires screeching) Think you're going? But what would you want to hold me? I told Porter everything I know. He's the one said I should leave town. Oh, Porter told you to leave town, eh. Yes. Where's Cathy? She went to Ruehl's ranch. You let her go out there alone? Look Carrington, I'm not responsible to you for any of my actions. As a matter of fact, there is only one way to deal with you. (body splashes into pool) You never will learn. (car engine whirring) Carrington. Carrington. I'm telling you, Porter is at my ranch right now arresting Claude. Porter is not arresting anyone. You mean he is not... Bring these people in and buckle them. You stupid little man. You sure she's wearing the ring? You know she always wears it. I told her never to take it off. I told her that there was a legend connected with it. How do I read it? Well, the star's north, the sun is east, the date represents the latitude and the longitude, the trident represents water. The whole deposit is submerged in the coral reef in the shallow water. (Claude screams) (car tires screeching) Oh, hello Cathy. Hello, where's Claude? Come in. (distant car engine whirring) Claude, he met with an accident. An accident? Yes, he's in there. You wouldn't want to meet with an accident, would you? I don't know what you mean. I want that ring with a map on it. But I lost it, I haven't got it. Wait. (punch thud) (car engine whirring) Come on, Cathy, let's get out of here. But what is this all about? It's a long story and not a very pretty one. Let's go. (gun bangs) Thanks Donovan, you finally paid off. You even up the score. The score is never even up as long as men like Porter are still alive. (plane engine whirring) Okay, George, she's all yours. Don't forget to sweep out the rice. Okay, Hobe. I've got another flight for you, Hobe. Are you kidding, Donovan? You know I won't do any more jobs for you. Yes, but this is right down your alley. It's a wedding in Las Vegas and I'm going to be the best man. Not a chance, I'm booked for the weekend. Besides, there's too many people getting married. I heard what you said. See what I mean? (Donovan laughs) A fine thing having Donovan propose for you. What kind of a girl are you? Just forgot I've got a good notion to... So have I. Hey, George, never mind about the rice. (dramatic music)
