[J.T.] You know, you're supposed to be my friend, and you lied to me. [J.T.] Well, you sure as hell left out a lot of important details. That place was a nightmare. You almost got me killed. [man] Hey, I told you. I told you there was a legend surrounding the existence of the key. But no, no, you didn't want to listen. You said, and I'm paraphrasing now, that you didn't believe in ghosts, and that legends were cow excrement. [J.T.] Ed, I want you to do me a favor. Just give me my money and I'm gonna say goodbye. [Ed] Well, you still haven't told me. Did you get the key or not? I got the key, and when you pay me, it's yours. [horn honking] [vehicle drives away] Wait here. I'll get the professor. Do you have the key, Mr. Striker? [grunts] The crowns! -[clicking] -[whirring] [Ed] This is one of the four golden crowns, created by the Visigoths in the sixth century, sometime after their conquest of Spain. [professor] Legend dictates that the gold balls atop three of the four crowns contain secrets to unleashing incredible powers of good and evil. After centuries, they passed into the fabric of myth and legend, until 1887. [Ed] When an archaeologist discovered them in the mountains outside Toledo. [professor] But when the Arabs invaded Spain, three of the four crowns disappeared. The fourth fell into the Arabs' hands. In attempting to unlock its secrets without using the key, they destroyed the gold ball. Three years ago, I learned the location of the key, but there was no sense in recovering it, since the crowns were still missing. Until this crown, had surfaced. of a Sherpa mountain climber in Nepal, and convinced him to sell it to me. And now, we shall see. The very existence of this scroll supports the legend. And where are the other crowns? We know where they are. [man] I want you to taste what I taste! I want you to hear what I hear! I want you to see what I see! I want you to feel what I feel! I want you to be what I am! And if you won't, then go to hell! [crowd chanting] Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! [Ed] Leo Green, born in Brooklyn, New York. Served seven years in Sing Sing for armed robbery, where he claims to have experienced religious vision. -[scoffs] -[Ed] When he got out he borrowed a hundred bucks and became one of those... those mail-order ministers. And he ordained himself Brother Jonas. When his small, store front, cult following began to grow, he complained of political harassment. The, uh, government claimed tax fraud. He's got the crowns. This guy is an animal! We're not talking about some nut who thinks he's the Messiah, or a bunch of brainwashed kids in robes bugging you in an airport. This maniac recruits for a purpose. A power base for his chosen people. The sick, the desperate, the lonely. His apostles go out and round 'em up like they were stray dogs. Then they ship 'em off to his private mountain fortress. You look at this place? It's supposedly to keep people out, huh? The truth is, it's to keep the apostles in. Hell, they even have cells there if you disobey his laws. [Jonas] Welcome, my children. Welcome to the city of love and unity, I have prayed for the day when I would see your face before me. The face of loneliness! "Here you are needed, here you are loved" bull, and turns them against everything and everyone they've known. That's his indoctrination squad. until they're walking zombies. They turn over their money, Last count, he had 15,000 of them working the airports, shopping malls, streets, all over the world. Each one of them can turn in between 60 and 90,000 a year. Now, you figure that out. That's close to 900 million a year, tax free. [professor] He must be stopped, Mr. Striker. For Jonas, the crowns are a source of destructive power, weapons of fear. But I want to preserve that power for the future of mankind. They're part of an incredible legacy. I must have them. Let me ask you something. Why, do all those people have Halloween masks on? Those are the only photos to have ever come out of there. They were taken during the height Everyone in the cult but Jonas wears a mask, because the individual's identity is insignificant. Only he's important. So what's this got to do with me? We want you to help us steal the crowns. Forget it. Just give me my money, will ya? Here. Here's your damn money! I don't believe you. Help us get the crowns! Weird. And the two of you, sittin' in this big room, believin' in that fairy-tale, magic potion crap. And you? What you went through for that key? That was a fairy tale, huh? Nah, nah, that was damn real! We got diagrams, photos, blueprints. All we need's a few good people. Ed, you lost it! [door slams] [wind blowing] [music playing] Miss? Would you happen to know a guy named Rick Martin? [woman] Yeah, I know him. He staggered out of here a couple of hours ago. You say staggered? [scoffs] Terrific. Would you happen to know where I could find him? -You might try his cabin. -And where's that? If you've got a few minutes I'll draw a map for you. -Yeah, I'd appreciate that. Thank you. -You got it. You hear what she said? She said, "staggered." You know what that means? It means a guy can't walk. [J.T.] Listen, why don't you just worry about the planning and making all the little gadgets. Let me take care of the team. [Ed] Hey, we're talking about staggering, huh? Staggering? I mean, that's somewhere between stumbling and crawling. [J.T.] Ed, cut me a break, will ya? [Ed] Cut you a break? [door creaking] [door shuts] [clattering] -I don't want to jump to any rash conclusions... -C'mon. -Can you hear me? -...but I'm a little dubious... -Rick, get up! C'mon. -This guy's gonna be a great help. -[groans] -Don't do this to me! Why don't we put him in charge'? [grunts] What the hell's goin' on here? [blows raspberry] Well... you see, I've been thinking normal, J.T. I just can't do it. Just can't handle it any more. I'll buy that. You're the best I ever seen, and if you could stay sober for three weeks, you could climb anything. [chuckles] That's the problem. I... I haven't been able to stay sober for five years. Look at this. What is it?! A platypus. No, Rick. That's a $100,000 and a way out of this mess. If you could just stay sober for three weeks. What do I have to do, spell it out for ya? If it doesn't come in a bottle, I'm not interested. Have you lost that alleged mind of yours? -This guy's gonna get us killed. -[Rick moaning] [J.T.] Look, he'll be all right. -[Rick] Just can't... -[Ed] What are we, AA? This guy can't climb a flight of stairs. Look, I can take care of his drinking problem. He hasn't got a problem drinking. He's got a problem staying sober. Look at him. He's practically paralyzed. [J.T.] Don't worry about it, he'll snap out of it. I've seen him like this before. First person to snap out of a terminal coma. Oh, boy. Nothing serious. DT's. That's it for me, man. That is it for me. [rumbling] [high-pitched whirring] Whoa! [whirring continues] [rattling] [Striker] It's trying to escape! -[rattling] -[whirring] [whirring stops] [panting] [upbeat music playing] -[yelling] -[siren wailing] [grunting] [men yelling] [man] All right, c'mon, Socrates. Get her up! -[growling] -Up, up! That's it. Now around. 'Round again. All right, now down. Let her down. All right, all right, that's a wrap. Kill those lights, kill the music. Well, it stinks, but maybe it'll work. [man on radio indistinct] Before you start, the answer is no. I've gotten too old and too smart. How'd you find me, huh? You got a real first-class act, Socrates. I just followed the crowds. -Do you mind, Popo? -Uh-huh. I'm leavin'. I'm leavin'. How you doing, buddy? How's it look like I'm doing? -And Liz? -Fine. Now cut out the small talk. You found me. Why? A job. There's a lot of money in it. What do you call a lot? A hundred thousand for you, and a hundred thousand for Liz. Hm. So... talk. Well, well, J.T. Striker. [both laughing] How you doing? Hi. How you doing? So, what are you here for? -Business or pleasure? -Business. Well, he doesn't go anywhere without me. I told him we'd listen, and if we don't like it, we walk. [laughing on radio] I'll be back in three weeks. Mm, I'm sure you will. You know, always said J.T. meant trouble. Yeah, well, this time he means money. A lot of money. You can't do this kind of work anymore. -I'm as strong as ever! -Except for your heart. [applause on radio] I ain't kiddin' myself. I'm lucky if I got six months. But Liz, she has the rest of her life. Gotta do it for her. She has a right to know. Hm? I'll hold you to that. Brother Jonas's small cult did not begin to flourish until he gained possession of the crowns. When so-called political harassment forced him to flee America, he bought Hog Mountain in the Pyrenees. The mountain's massive cliffs make it invulnerable to those who wish to get on, and hold captive those who wish to leave. Mr. Martin. The only things on the mountain are this 700 year old village, called by Jonas the City of Love and Unity, and this stone temple named the Temple of the Crowns. He's turned the place into a sort of shrine. [mechanical whirring] [professor] One crown, Scintilla, Spanish for diamonds. It holds the power of evil, disease, famine, human despair. The other crown, Adamus, Latin for diamond, the power of human goodness, a key to eternal happiness and peace. [Ed] And to protect them, he's turned the village, and the temple, into an armed fortress. You see these white lights? They represent armed watchtowers. Those green lights represent the checkpoints for roving bands of guards. How we gonna get by that? In two weeks, the brotherhood will be in the last day of its annual baptismal rituals for new converts. From sunrise to sunset, they observe this night with celebrations and indoctrinations. That's your cover. That still doesn't explain how we get past the guards. Look, a year ago, two of Brother Jonas's top organizers abandoned the cult. We got to them before his assassination squad. They sold us blueprints, diagrams, the works. They even smuggled out a key to the castle's main entrance. The temple doors, are secured by two electronic locks which can be activated by an intricate series of sound impulses. We've established that it's 180 feet long, 30 feet wide, -and 50 feet high. -[beeping] Twenty-five feet down the corridor is a floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall iron grate. It has a gate, but the whole thing is electrified with enough juice to kill upon the... upon the slightest contact. And now, the most challenging problem. This. Drop this into the temple. [alarm blaring] [Ed] The floor and walls are embedded with countless hundreds of laser eyes. Break their beams, and you set off an alarm. And those are the problems. And we have from midnight, when the temple closes, until dawn, when it reopens, to solve them. So we got about six hours. Yeah. But it might be less. Because we can't hit the temple... until the ceremony's at its peak. So that could leave us just two or three hours. Those laser beams, can they be taken out? Yeah, once we hit the end of the corridor. In the cupola above the statue. But they're protected by thick iron bars. Why don't we just cut out the bars, and you lower me through one of those windows? We can't, because the entire roof is pressure sensitive, and it's tied into the laser eye alarm system that goes up the whole corridor. Maybe you ought to get serious. [Rick] All right, pal, let's get serious. You got a tired old man, an inexperienced female-- And you? What about you? Just calm down, honey, I'm saving the best for last. And you, a guy who thinks we can get ready for this job by playing with these Tinker Toys. And me. A guy with 90-proof courage. And you want us to do this? Every time I get involved with you, J.T., it's problems. How the hell are we gonna pull this off? He's right. We can't walk on the floor, we can't touch the walls. -Yeah. -And we can't climb on the roof. How the hell are we gonna pull this off? We fly. And with this... those crowns are ours. [rumbling] Oh, brother. Here we go again. [high-pitched whirring] [droning sound] [grunting] [yelling] [whirring continues] [grunting continues] [groans] [grunts] [yelps] [screaming] [grunting] [grunting] [whirring stops] [J.T. panting] What happened? It was nothing... unless you believe... believe in ghosts. [bells jingling] [animal howling] [birds squawking] [people marching] My lungs. My... my lungs aren't working. Ah, c'mon. We're having a good time, man. Let's go. [bird squawking] [grunting] My children... you are blessed. For you have entered into the kingdom of heaven. For my light is the divine light. For my way is the divine way. For my power is the divine power. For my life is the divine life. Believe in me, and you will live in eternal bliss. Stray, and you will perish in the flames of hell! [clattering] [exhales] [panting] [J.T.] Go on. We've only got four minutes until those guards pass again. Everybody remember, once inside the door, there's only 18 inches of safe space, okay? [Liz] Okay. [clicking] [beeping] [rapid beeping] [buzzing] -[clicking] -Huh? [clicking] [beeping] Ed, if you don't pick it up, we're gonna get caught. Ed, you hear me? C'mon! Will you stop telling me that? Makes me nervous. [beeping] [buzzing] Well? -Ed, you're a genius! -Yeah. Let's go. [whirring] [lock clicks] Big. [Rick] This place is really blanketed with laser beams. We don't even have room to take a deep breath. [J.T.] Yeah, but does everything check out with the diagrams? -[Ed] No. -[J.T.] What do you mean? [Ed] We only have about a foot of clearance between the beams and the... and the grill work. After that, pressure sensitive floor. Oh, Ed, that's a problem. Need any help with those? How much time we got? It's 3:05. Two hours and 55 minutes 'til dawn. Everybody got that? All right, buddy, let's go. All right, Liz. It's all yours. Okay, Ed. It's play time. [bells jingling] [groaning] Now remember, our work space above the alarms is less than ten feet. Now we're counting on you, okay? -Okay. -Go. [J.T.] Here's the wrench. [cranking] [cranking] Reach. [door creaking] [clicking] [exhales] spot check like that all night? If they do, we're in trouble. Let's go. Easy! If I touch the grill, I'm fried. [electronic whirring] [door unlocks] [growling] [dog panting] [growls] [J.T. whispering] You're doing fine. Go on, easy now. Stay in the clear. [grunts] Watch it. [snapping] [grunting] [panting] [bells jingling] [whimpering] This is a stray lamb. She has left the flock. So she was stricken with disease. She repents her sins, and wants to come home to me. With divine powers, vested in me through the crowns, I will destroy the pain, and allow her to return to the fold. My divine strength will heal this sick creature, but you must help me. You must believe in me, children. [yelping] Are you okay? -[coughing] -What's wrong? Uh, nothing. You sure? Okay. [yelping] Oh, my God! Get me up, man! Get me up! Get me up, man! -I'm gonna drop! -Get him, get him, Rick! C'mon, Rick. [beeping] [J.T.] C'mon, Ed, what's wrong with it? -How much time do we have? -It's late. Move it, Ed, it's now or never. [electric whir] [woman whimpers] [gasps] [rattling] [whimpering] [wheezes] Help me, help me. Relieve me from sin, don't let me perish. Heal this lamb! Take away her pain! [tambourines shaking] Here I come, you magical son of a bitch. [mumbling indistinct] Heal my suffering. Take me back into the fold. Let the power of the crowns come in! -Heal! Heal! -[gasping] Heal! -[girls] Heal! -[Jonas] Heal! -Heal! -Heal! -[all] Heal! -Heal! [all] Heal! Heal! Heal! Heal! -[woman yelling] -[all] Heal! Heal! Heal! Heal! -Heal! Heal! Heal! -[yelling continues] Heal! [groaning] [panting] My pain is gone. You are the divine power. Jonas. Jonas! [all] Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! Jonas! when this thing's all over, Why don't you just save me one from that flask you've been hittin' on? Everybody ready? Okay, Ed. Knock 'em out, man. [beeping] The... This remote-control unit, it's not working. What do you mean it's not working? It... it... it's not working. I mean, it's not working. I can't knock out the lasers, I... I can't knock out the alarm. -What do we do? -Well, J.T., what do you say? We go for it. Now, you two, hit the window. Let me down slowly. [grunting] [yelling] [Liz gasping] [straining] [groaning] I'm okay. Go to the window. [screams] -[groans] -[J.T.] Liz! Do what he says, Liz. -No! -[J.T.] Go on! -[grunts] -[J.T.] Ed, 'get the blowtorch and help her to the window. -[grunts] -[Liz] No! [grunts] -Rick, are you all right? -Yeah. [exhales] [electronic whirring] [clattering] [groans] [whimpers] [grunts] -[yelling] -[alarm blaring] The crowns! [yelling] My eyes! J.T. J... J.T., c'mon on, man. -J.T. J.T., c'mon, pull yourself-- -Get the crowns! [grunting] Go get the crowns! [grunts] [electronic whirring] [click] [droning sound] -[cracking] -[groans] [yelling] [bells jingling] [whimpers] [pulsating] [pulsating] -[door unlocking] -[gasps] [grunting] [screaming] [grunting] [grunting] Kill him! Kill him! [yelling] No! [yelling] [crying] J.T., don't hurt me, please. [grunting] [whimpers] [electronic whirring] [yelling] [crying] [breathing heavily] [wincing] [crying] [beeping] [professor] Come in, Mr. Striker. Come in. I am one minute from pick up position. Repeating, one minute from pick up. Are you ready? Come in, Mr. Striker. Come in. Are you ready? We're ready. [professor] Mr. Striker... did you get the crowns? Mr. Striker, can you hear me? Come in, Mr. Striker. -Mr. Striker, did you get the crowns? -Yeah, old man... -Mr. Striker, answer me. -...we got 'em. The crowns; did you get them? Their magic, their power, their potential to benefit mankind is enormous. Disease, plague, and all the evils of the world can be relegated to the pages of history. They're our greatest resource. They can determine the future of the universe, Mr. Striker. Mr. Striker! Can you hear me, Mr. Striker? Mr. Striker! [electronic whirring] [pulsating] [growling] [thunder rumbling] [growling]
