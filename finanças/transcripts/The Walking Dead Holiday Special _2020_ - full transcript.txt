Welcome to "The Walking Dead" Holiday Special. This is the first one, the first one of these we've ever done. Why did it take us 10 years to do this? Well, it doesn't matter, because we're doing it now and we're gonna celebrate with our "Walking Dead" family and... and bring you some much needed holiday cheer. That is my goal for you. I want to give you some holiday cheer. We're gonna do that with singing. We're gonna do that with lots of surprises, information, surprise guests, we're gonna have. We're gonna have a... a mega "in memoriam", okay, with... with 10 seasons' worth of epic walker kills. And obviously, look, of course we wish we could be doing this in person. Of course we wish we could be with our family and friends in person. But you know what? Virtually is the way to go this year. So that's we're gonna do. We're gonna make the best of it. And... and I really hope you join us along while we do that. Now, let's talk about guests for this episode. We have Judith Grimes. Cailey Fleming will be here. We have Lauren Cohan. We have Emily Kinney. We're gonna reunite the Greene sisters. We have Josh McDermitt, A.K.A. Eugene, and also T-Dog himself. Irone Singleton will be here. I'm very excited about that. And, of course, Angela Kang and Scott M. Gimple, as well. We're gonna talk about the future of "The Walking Dead" and "The Walking Dead" universe. So more information and tidbits on that, too. So tons of epic holiday gifts I lay at your feet as we begin the first-ever "Walking Dead" Holiday Special! [BELLS JINGLING] Later in the show, Irone Singleton's gonna be joining us, and Emily Kinney is gonna perform a holiday classic. But right now, please say hello to my guests Cailey Fleming, Lauren Cohan, and, of course, Josh McDermitt, joining us for this holiday... - Whoo-whoo! - ... Spectacular. Very nice to see everyone. Josh, you got the garland in the background. That's fantastic. - Cailey has a gorgeous... - Just trying to be festive. A... a tree back there, and then, Lauren, I think that could be considered a holiday plant. [LAUGHING] Sure. [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] I was gonna do it before today, and it just... it just didn't happen, but that cushion has some red, so... You know what? It's fine. It doesn't... you know what? It's fine. The holiday spirit's in our hearts. It doesn't have to be in an elaborate, you know, decorative holiday set like here. I mean, this is nothing. Just a little something we threw together. It's whatever. It's fine. It's fine. Let's talk about the holidays. Lauren, did you have any specific holiday traditions growing up? I mean, my family, so we're, like, half English, half American, half celebrate the Hanukkah, half celebrate Christmas. But our family's favorite tradition seriously is, we play "Celebrity." Everybody calls it something different, I guess. But you know where you have... you do... the first time you do the clues, and then you do a charade, - and then you do just one motion. - Yeah. This makes sense, I think. So our grandfather plays with us, and he is such a stickler for rules in every element of life. So he insists that he's following the rules when we play this game. But he... every one of his clues is a rhyme that sounds exactly like the clue. But he insists he's following the rules. And he's very old, and he's very English. And so one year, one of his clues was Michael Jackson. And he... [LAUGHS] and he gets really mad when you tell him he's cheating. So he said, "it sounds like... Ichael Ackson. Ichael Ackson", like this, and you're like, "no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's... that's... that's not a good clue." He's like, "Lauren, I know how to play this game. I know how to play." Josh McDermitt, any... any particular holiday memories stand out for you when you were a kid? I remember... there was this one time when... there was a store by my... my house. I think it's gone now. It's called... it was called Smitty's. It's kind of like a Walmart-type store where you can just do... go there and do anything. You could go, you know, buy your clothes, you could get your oil changed. There's a restaurant, get your groceries. - It was just, like, all that. - Yeah. And my friends and I were, like, really into football cards. Like, baseball cards, but for football. And we went to Smitty's, and all the football cards from this one brand... and I don't remember what brand it was... but you can kind of see through the back of the package, and you could see what football player was, like, on the last card. So you would just find a certain one where you're like, "Well, I got Jerry Rice's rookie card in this one." So, you know, you would just... you would collect all those, go buy them. And then we would take them to the baseball card shop and resell them. And so we had, like... it was almost like a little racket. Right? Well, one of the neighbor kids found out that this is how we were making some extra money. So he shows up, and he took all the base... all the football cards from us. And so we started chasing him through Smitty's. And it was like one of those... it was like a western where, like, we'd both turn down an aisle, and we're, like... it's like a face-off. They're down... he's down on this end. We're on this end. We're like, "get out!" And we'd, like, chase after him. He's, like, running with all the football cards. And we tackled him in the birdseed aisle, and birdseed went everywhere, and we got apprehended by store security. Fun fact... store security was also Santa Claus. [LAUGHS] Santa, of course, took over your card racket, and then that was it. He's like, "I'm gonna take over this racket." He... he sold off all the Bo Jackson rookie cards. "It sure would be a shame if you was to end up on the naughty list. I'm just saying, it would be a shame. It would be a shame." Cailey, how do you think Judith would celebrate the holidays? 'Cause we've never actually seen our group celebrate the holidays. So you... I feel like Judith is a really creative person. So she'd probably be the one to decorate the tree or to decorate the house. And they'd probably make ornaments for their tree. I bet their tree is all homemade ornaments that Judith made. - Right. - And R.J. probably helped her. And she probably might have family dinner, and Carol brings the cookies. She would have to. [LAUGHS] - Yeah, she would have to. - I also think Judith would be in the corner sharpening a candy cane, and then if, like... then... yeah, then if a walker came in, just pbht, like, right through the... right through the chin and then... but then also a Christmas decoration. You rehang it on the tree, and you're good to go. Yeah. Exactly. It's a homemade ornament. This wouldn't be a holiday special without music. So we have a couple great performances coming up. First of all, a parody of "12 Days of Christmas" called "10 Seasons of 'The Walking Dead,'" which will be epically sung by Khary Payton Cooper Andrews, Eleanor Matsuura, and Cassidy McClincy. But first, it is my extreme pleasure to introduce the incredibly talented Emily Kinney, who will be accompanied by Adam Tressler for a very special version of "Up on the Housetop."

We are back with Cailey and Lauren and Josh, now joined by Irone Singleton, T-Dog himself, and, of course, Emily Kinney. Emily, amazing job. I mean, this is not a holiday special without music, so thank you for bringing beautiful music to the program. I know "Walking Dead" fans are so thrilled to see you perform. Can you talk a little bit about what their continued support has meant to you so many years even after being on the show? Yeah, it's cool because, you know, it... with Beth, she was a singer, and she got to sing on the show. And because of that, a lot of "The Walking Dead" fans, who are so awesome and so supportive of all of us, they got to know Beth a little bit more through music. And then they also checked out my music and got to know me as a singer and a songwriter. So it's been... it's been really awesome to stay connected in that way. And, yeah, I'll have new music out next year. And, yeah, it's been awesome. Having done this show for a decade, what we started to realize early on is, like, oh, this is a community. Like, this is, like, once you're part of the "Walking Dead" family, you're always a part of "The Walking Dead" family. Case in point, Irone Singleton, who when T-Dog died, and I think for a long time on "Talking Dead"... I... there was an exclamation of, "not T-Dog!" You know, that was kind of when we started to figure out on this show of, like, ah, man, we lose characters that we love so much. It's so good to see you, man. People are very excited that you're on the show, like pumpkinqueen519 on Instagram, who says, "What do you miss most, and what did you love most about being on the show?" I... I loved the handshakes, the hugs, the kisses, all the love that I received from my castmates, particularly on the parting day when Alison was crying, when Reedus was handing me my shield. And I think Emily was crying a little bit. But Alison was right there. I was like, "Don't cry. You gonna make me cry, Alison." I... but, yeah. That's what I miss most. This is from TWD.FTWDladies on Instagram, and they want to know, "Irone, who was the funniest cast member on set in those early seasons?" [LAUGHS] Instant laughter because I thought of my man Bernthal. Jon Bernthal. You know, a lot of people would... would think Steven Yeun just because he came through Second City and all that stuff. But Bernthal, at the beginning, he's kind of quiet and bashful. But once you get to know him, look out. Zingers left and right. [LAUGHTER] This, of course, would not be a holiday special without a reunion of some sort. And I'm very excited that we were able to reunite the Greene sisters. Emily, can you talk about some of your fondest memories of working with Lauren? I feel like from the very beginning, there was a really special connection between us and between Scott. And I can even remember one time on set, like, us saying to each other, "Oh, my gosh, I'm so glad it was you", because probably so many people, you know, auditioned for these roles and it felt so easy, like, to be honest. But as I've gone on to work on different shows, then I have especially come to appreciate how... how great it was to work with Lauren, because it's not always that easy on other sets. And so I don't know. Something happened with casting or whatever, where it just happened to line up that it... it did feel like family. It's so true. I was thinking that, too. Just, like, for you to feel like... really feel like my younger sister. And I've said that to you before. And I've thought that. It's... it's... it's that way that you really treat someone like your younger sister, whether they want you to treat them like it or not sometimes. Like... like, I have this protective, like, I'm gonna give you advice when something... when we talk about something, sometimes I have to remind myself, "No, she's not your real sister. She's your friend." Josh, Katy P on Facebook wants to know, "What would you say is your favorite Eugene scene or episode?" One that stands out is when I got... when I ate all that mac and cheese, and then I got to throw up on Selena... I mean Christian. And that was really fun to do that because I think they used the same rig... Greg Nicotero and his guys used the same rig because they did "The Hateful Eight", too, for Tarantino. And it was the same thing that... not to spoil anything, but the... when Kurt Russell threw up, apparently it was the same rig that he wore, and that was the highlight of my career. It did... but... [LAUGHS] I have a question for Cailey from bigbrother1988 on Twitter. "What was the most intense moment you've shot on the show so far?" That's a good question. In season 9, whenever Judith and Michonne are on the rocks, that is definitely my all-time favorite scene. That was right after I had my first on-screen katana kill. And I was so excited. And then we shot that scene on the rocks. And I just felt the connection in that scene. Coming up, a mega-size "in memoriam" which encompasses 10 seasons of amazing walker kills from "The Walking Dead." But first, here's Eleanor Matsuura Cassidy McClincy, Khary Payton, and Cooper Andrews performing their version of "12 Days of Christmas" entitled "The 10 Seasons of 'Walking Dead.'" [BELLS JINGLING] Who's ready for some... Happy-holiday cheer? Who we got on the line? Coop? Yeah, boss! - What about Eleanor? - You guys, let's do this. Cassidy, you ready? I'm ready to go.

That was Lauren Ridloff with a special thank-you message to all our essential workers. As a matter of fact, we should have a big round of applause for all of our essential workers who are out there on the front lines keeping us safe and healthy. Thank you so much for all that you do. We are back with Cailey and Josh and Emily and Irone and Lauren. This question is for Josh from adamdalton7 on Instagram. "Do you remember what your first day on set was like?" It was a very, very long day. The actor playing Abraham couldn't remember his lines. One of the most excruciating work experiences of my life. Thankfully, thankfully, they fired him right away. And then we were able to bring in Michael Cudlitz. So it was Larry David. We hired Larry David to play Abraham. That makes sense. His hair wasn't working. But Michael Cudlitz already had fire-engine red hair, and so he was ready to go. But, yeah. Irone, what do you remember most about your first day on the show? First day, 100 degrees. 100 degrees-plus. - Yeah. - With the humidity, it was... we were told that it was, like... it felt like 117 degrees. But that's how we bonded. Under such duress, I think that's when the most bonding takes place. When you're going through it, you know. Just kind of takes me back to the hood. You just... you just bond under those circumstances. And that's when I think we really became a family. Cailey, what do you remember about your first day on set? It wasn't that long ago, but what do you remember about it? So my first day on set was the scene where Judith picks her hat, and she's like, "I'm Judith. Judith Grimes." And I was so excited because that scene is iconic for me. Yeah. I remember Greg directed that episode, and I love Greg. And we shot the scene once. And then we shot it a second time, and on the second take, he was like, "That's it. I've never done that before. We need to do it again." And I was like, "Okay", so we did it again. And I think the one that made the cut was the second take. And that's all I remember. Emily, first day. I remember the hair and makeup trailer door opening, and Steven was shirtless, and they were searching him for, like, tick bites, and he was just like, - "Oh, I think there's this one here." - Oh. And, like, he had so many mosquito bites, and it kind of, like, set up the whole... I don't know. Like, there's just a lot of bugs in Georgia. And like, later on, you know, I would also be like, "Okay, do I have ticks? Do I..." [LAUGHS] They're, like, looking. Like, looking for tick bites and stuff. We were on set one day, and then it was early on, and we looked over and then, you know... 'cause everyone's talking about the ticks and there's things called chiggers that, like, burrow into your skin or something. I mean, it's, like, wretched. But we looked over, and there was, like, some armadillos, and they were, like, baby armadillos, and Christian and Alanna went over and picked them up and played with them. And that's how they got leprosy. [LAUGHTER] Coming up, we have exclusive footage from a table read from an upcoming episode of "The Walking Dead." And also later in the show, Scott M. Gimple and Angela Kang are gonna be joining us. But first, before you decide if Negan is on the Naughty or Nice List, let's slow things down and say a final holiday farewell to 10 seasons' worth of walkers that we have lost. ♪♪ _ [GUNSHOTS] ♪♪ [GROWLING] _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [BELLS JINGLING] - ["DECK THE HALLS" PLAYS] - _ _ _ _ _ ♪♪ ["DECK THE HALLS" PLAYS] ♪♪ ♪♪ Welcome back to "The Walking Dead" Holiday Special. We're back with Cailey and Lauren and Josh and Irone and Emily. Hey, here's a fun gift idea. The St. Daryl candle in all its glory. But now we have a question sent in by a fan. But you know what? I'm gonna let them do it. Roll it. Hi, everyone. I'm Devonda from Missouri, and I'm a huge fan of "The Walking Dead." This question is for everyone. If your "Walking Dead" character was invited to a holiday party, what would they be in charge of bringing? I guess let's start with... who wants to go first? You want to... Lauren, do you want to go first? I think I would bring maybe the turkey, like, that I had... had... had gotten myself, but if there's any vegetarians watching, I want you to know this is Maggie. This is... this is "Walking Dead" land. It's a... it's a healthy Turkey. It had a good life. But that feels most in the pocket of that character that somebody said, "Would you bring something?" And maybe it's sort of over her shoulder. And she says, "Here you go." Got it. Cailey, what would Judith bring to the holiday party? She would probably be in charge of the games. Okay, any... any particular game stick out? What... what... what holiday games? Maybe there's a walker. It's like Pin the Tail on the donkey, but it's a walker in a Santa hat, and you have to pin the hat on the walker. That's really nice. That's... I was, my... my brain was like, "pin the jaw on the Walker." You got to pin the limbs back on. You're like, "Oh, a Santa hat." 'Cause it's... it's the holidays. We're gonna make him festive. That was a... that was a much better answer than mine. [LAUGHTER] So this is for Emily and Irone. Now that we know that the show is ending... in a couple of years. We still got a couple of years, we don't have to cry yet. We still got a couple years. Who... who do you think will be... who would you want to see the last person standing? We'll start with Emily. I just think it's gonna be probably Norman. Or Norman and Melissa. I think that's... I think that's just... Oh, Maggie. Maggie. Of course. Your own sister is right there! I... I don't know what I was thinking. Actually, you know what? I think that it might be my... if... if Beth or if I, Emily Kinney, was writing the script for the end, I would definitely pick Maggie as the one who is, like, the ruler of all of the new world, you know? Epic save. They beat the zombies. They beat the zombies. It's all over. Maggie is president. [LAUGHS] And then the helicopter would bring in Michonne, and it lands. She... Yeah, she's the winner. CHRIS: But then Maggie's like, "This is my turf now." And then they battle it out. Irone, what about you? So, of course, you know, my... my two sisters and brother here, they're still on the show. So you put me on the spot, but... - Cadaryl sounds so awesome. - Mm-hmm. And we gonna throw you all in the mix. - But Cadaryl. - Yeah. And then, plus, I started thinking someone. So, you know, you're an O.G., L.C. You're an O.G. - But they are, like, O.G. - The O.O.G. Oh, okay. You know, I love you all. I... I got... I think... I got to say Judith. I really think Judith is gonna be, like, the leader of the new world. I just... I've always felt that. From that first iconic scene with her, it was like, she's... she's... that's our leader. She's the leader of the new world, so... - Yay! - I just got chills, actually. CHRIS: Also please know that I have no influence or control over anything that happens on the show. But if I were... I'm gonna tell you something. We're... we're gonna take a quick break because there are people who are coming on the show who can make that happen. And I'm gonna lean on them to do that. But first, I want to thank Irone and Emily for being here. Thank you so much for being such special parts of "The Walking Dead" family. And forever you will be part of "The Walking Dead" family. It's so wonderful to see you both. Please stay safe and healthy. And thank you so much for being here. Coming up, we have exclusive footage of a table read from an upcoming episode of "The Walking Dead." Plus, we'll be joined by Scott M. Gimple and Angela Kang. But, hey, when our show is done, if you want to keep the conversation about "The Walking Dead" going all the time, head on over to the twitch channel TWDUniverse. There are live streams four days a week. You're gonna get to convene with other fans and keep the conversation going 'round the clock. So that's on twitch. TWDUniverse is the name.

Melissa McBride here, and I have wishes, wishes for peace and a joyful heart to you and all of your loved ones in whatever ways you can find to be together this holiday season.

Until then, please keep safe, keep well, and have a very, very, very happy holiday season. ♪♪ Welcome back to "The Walking Dead" Holiday Special. That was a wonderful message for you, the fans, from Melissa McBride. Now we are joined by executive producer Angela Kang and chief content officer for "The Walking Dead" universe, Scott M. Gimple to our virtual holiday spectacular. Now, Scott, in the spirit of the holidays, can you gift us with any information about "The Walking Dead" universe or, let's say, this "movie" that we've heard a lot about? 'Cause a lot of times, asking you questions about "Walking Dead", it's like... it's like five boxes nested in each other. And I shake the box, and I try to figure out what the gift is inside, and I can never figure it out. You're uncrackable, but in the spirit of the holidays, what can you tell us? Two years ago, almost to the day, I was in the wilds of England with Mr. Andy Lincoln working on the movie. And because we work in television, we thought we would be working on the second one right now. Movies take a long time. But it'll be worth the wait. It is moving forward. The COVID time kind of slowed things down anyways, but we're using that time to go back to the lab and make it as great as possible. I know that doesn't give you much. I think you can barely hear anything rattling around the box. No, actually what you gave me was a really nice socks. - But it's happening. - Like, socks are great. - I will give you a couple other things. - I wanted a Nintendo Switch, but that's fine. We're working on something with one of the great "Walking Dead" villains of all time, and it's coming together. And we are working on a straight "Walking Dead" comedy right now. You know, we're not making fun of our world, but it's just more of a comedic take on the world. And then, you know, there's this show about these... Characters Daryl and Carol that people might like. And there's also this anthology we're working on. So I don't know. It's socks, I guess, for you. It's socks for you, Chris. Socks for you. But they're really nice socks, though. Like, wool. They're really, really gorgeous. They've got a lot of... a lot of nice earth tones. Angela, you all have done such an amazing job of completely reconfiguring how "The Walking Dead" is done in light of the last nine months. So may I ask, what is the gift that you might offer fans about what we can expect from the extended 10th season? I'm really excited about so much in these episodes. They're... they're these really focused stories, each one. So you really get to dive into people in a fun way, I think. So, you know, we get to do a whole little arc with Daryl and Carol that I think is really fun. We get to see that group that got caught by some folks in some white trooper armor. So that's Ezekiel, Eugene, Yumiko, and Princess. So we're gonna find out a little more about what's going on there. I'm really excited to share an episode that's got Gabriel and Aaron with Robert Patrick as the guest star. - Oh, wow. - For people who know that actor. He's amazing. I've been a fan of him, like, forever and ever and ever. So we... you know, he's... he's amazing in the episode, as well as our actors are amazing. We'll find out about what Maggie's been up to a little bit. There's... there's a lot of story to unpack there. And there's obviously that Maggie-Negan story that we're gonna be seeing. And then for the Negan fans, we're going to do our version of the comic book story "Here's Negan!" And Lucille is gonna be played by JDM's real-life wife, Hilarie Burton Morgan. And they're amazing together. So I'm... I'm really excited for everyone to kind of see our various people getting to shine. Now, Scott, that's a friggin' gift bag - of information right there. - Oh, gosh. - That was a stocking full of... - Oh. - That was a bountiful... - That's how you do it, man. CHRIS: [LAUGHS] - That's how you do it. - The toys are, like... But the toys there are, like, we've been making those toys. Those toys are being made. We're... we're sort of planning the other toys right now. - I see. - You know, we're in R&D. - Yeah, but we're gonna go go play - Oh, geez. with those toys, though. We're gonna go play with the toys that Angela gave us. Fair play. Before we go to break, I want to show you some stuff here. So we got this "Walking Dead" holiday hoodie right here, which is very soft and very "Walking Dead-y." This "Woodbury Rocks" glass. Now, these are from the "Horde for the Holidays" edition of The Walking Dead supply drop. They're available just in time for the holidays. And they're at the new official online store for all things Go there and pick one up now. And, of course, everyone in the studio is gonna get one. Oh, it's just me. So I'll just... I'll just take this one. Coming up, we have an exclusive look at a table read for an upcoming episode of the extended 10th season of "The Walking Dead." We'll be right back. I'll take you, too, glass. ♪♪ [BELLS JINGLING] ♪♪ [BELLS JINGLING] _ "Exterior. Alexandria. Day. Daryl's covered in mud, motor oil, and walker gore." What the hell happened to you? I was gonna ask you the same thing. "Carol's covered in drywall, plaster dust. Her skin's streaked with sweat." They look like they've been through hell. - Hey. - You don't have to apologize. I'm good. Really. I was just gonna wish you luck. "Without any further word, they each take different paths." ♪♪ Welcome back to "The Walking Dead" Holiday Special. That was a table read from an upcoming episode called "Diverged" from the extended season 10. We're back with Cailey and Lauren and Josh and now joined by Scott and Angela. Lauren and Josh, what are you excited for the fans to see in 2021? I'm excited about it. Angela, tell us more things about what we're gonna do in 2021. That's what I'm excited about next year. What about you, Josh? I did the table read. I read the scene direction for the table read on JDM's episode, "Here's Negan", and I texted him after. I was like, "This is probably gonna be my favorite episode of... of the series." I'm really excited about it. Before we go, we have a very special little bit of Christmas magic. - Some might call it a poem. If you will, a po-em. - Oh. Our version of "'Twas the Night Before Christmas." And then pull up a cocoa. You mean like this cocoa? Yeah, here we go. "'Twas the night of the holiday party, and all through the land, not a creature was stirring, not even Merle's hand. The crossbows were polished, the ponchos were clean, the vests were angelic, all winged and supreme. The candies and cookies were set out on a barrel. And please rest assured, they were all made by Carol. Later that night, Daryl handed out snacks until a loud noise stopped him right in his tracks." Oh, there's adventure afoot. "He threw open the front door and looked all around and noticed some presents stacked high on the ground. A bracelet for Carol and some books for the Grimeses. A picture for Maggie in happier times. Aaron, Luke, and Jerry all got socks, and Eugene was thrilled with his brand-new pet rocks. Magna received hats upon hats, while Connie and Kelly got thousands of cats. And Princess new goggles, all bright and all pink. And great Shiva's ghost! Ezekiel got it. Rosita and Coco and Gabriel laughed when they all were gifted a baby giraffe." Could happen. "The room was filled with chatter and cheer all around, and giggles and singing and so many sounds. But there in the corner alone stood a man. In fact, it was Negan, no gift in his hand. At his feet, he found dog, who was making a racket and chewing on Negan's new leather jacket." Gasp. "Daryl walked over with neither glee nor delight, but he still said, 'Hey, Negan, we're all friends here tonight.' and with then... " that's... thank you. Thank you. "And that's when they saw it high up on a shelf, a new walkie-talkie. Was it left by an elf? They heard static and crackling, but nothing made sense. The room became so quiet, so serious, so tense. Together, they gathered, a closer look they did take, when a helicopter overhead made the entire house shake. And then a voice on the walkie was heard so clear and so bright. It was Rick Grimes himself wishing peace unto all, and to all a good night." ♪♪ Wow. See, Scott? That's how you do it. [LAUGHS] It's been so wonderful to see all of you. Honestly, this is gonna be my holiday party this year. So thank you so much for being a part of it. Thank you for watching the first-ever "Walking Dead" Holiday Special. This has been great, and I hope we provided you with some holiday cheer this year.
