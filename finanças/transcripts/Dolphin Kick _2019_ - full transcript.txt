Subtitles by explosiveskull You know that feeling you get when you look down at the pool and you start to inch your way in. Waiting because you don't want to feel the water. My mom used to tell us you're supposed to feel stuff. So don't cheat yourself out of a great moment. You can spend you whole life waiting with your toes in the water. Or you could just dive in. She could always make an adventure out of anything And her voice echoes to us everyday. That's my brother, Our parents promised us that on their fifteenth wedding anniversary they'd take us to the island where they got married. We knew the island would be fun, but we never knew we'd meet a special friend that would change our lives forever. Our buddy Echo! The Dolphin. Bro bro bro, did you see that cannonball?! It's spring break! Mom would have wanted you to have fun. Do you want to jump in? Fine, we won't go on the deep side. It's the same difference. Luke!

Along with everything else the first thing you put on is a life vest when you get in a boat. These decks are slippery on a boat. You slip and hit your head and go over. I don't care how strong a swimmer you are you're not going to do well. Check! What do we do next? Luke! Luke? Gas! Gas is not bad. Gotta make sure the boat's not taking on water first. Looks like it's floating to me. Yeah she's floating sweetie. But there's a plug in the back. Gotta make sure it's in all the way. Then you check fuel. Then last, we check for flares and paddles. Check! Now can we go? Not yet sweetie we need open water. Alright we got open water, everybody holding on? Sit down! - Yes sir! - Yup I'm good! Alright Sky, you can go ahead and say it now. Punch it! Whoa! Whoa! That boy is fast! Just in time to do absolutely nothing thank you! - I was working... - Working lion research. - Lion, lion research. All the lions of the ocean. - Lion research. Think you'll get this guy here. Uh, ok so here's the deal pretty sure this dude is like a trained MMA fighter, so let's be chill. Uh ok tough guys we're all going. Hey brother what's up? - How you doing? - Hey man you TUCC'd? Excuse me? We're T-U-C-C. Taino underwater clean up committee. Oh? Yeah we're giving out complimentary mugs so we can have a litter free island. The metal is so much better for the island. We find those cups all over the beach underwater, - that we clean up so... - I appreciate it thank y'all. Anything to keep the beaches clean. Thank you. But, uh, I don't remember this last time I was out here. Oh you've been here before? Yeah, it's been a while honeymoon. Would your wife like one too? It's just me and the kids this time. Well, uh, hey you're doing it wrong if you only chill at this resort. - I mean I know it's cool but... - You gotta venture out see the real Taino! We would love too, the resort doesn't tell you about any of the external life going on. They want to keep you here drinking the ten dollar lemonades. Ten dollars! I'm telling you man, you got ripped off. I believe you. - Hey guys, see you at Outriggers tonight? - Oh yeah! - Yeah man Outriggers for sure. - Of course! Outriggers, you would get that much cheaper and much better. It has the best switcha on the island man. Switcha? What's that? Lemonade man, that's what we call lemonade over here. - Taino lemonade. - Is it kid friendly? Oh yeah for sure. of course. - Alright, what time? - Uh, Taino-thirty. - It's Taino time, bro. - It's Taino time, baby. - I appreciate you. - It was nice meeting you. - Good to meet y'all. - We'll see you later, hopefully. No... Do you think he's here with us? Yeah I can feel it. Cool, a dolphin whisperer. Come on you can do it. Come on Luke! Come on man you gonna know this by now. Didn't you get this in the class we studied all weekend for this. Ten dollar lemonades! Hey, what's going on my man! - How you doing man. - How you all doing? How you guys doing? Everything good? - Welcome! - Yeah man! - What's your name big man? - Luke. - Luke. - I'm Skylar. - Sky for the cool kids. - Ooh man! Am I cool kid? Mmm, we'll see. Alright, alright. You gotta get some conch now, you're on Taino Island man. - Oh yes! - You gotta get some conch fritters - Conch salad, conch something. - Conch taco. - We have everything but conch tacos. - Nah man. Those aren't a thing even though they should be. I, uh, moved here for my master's and just been throwing conch into every ramen recipe like three times a day. - It's really gross. - It's actually not it's amazing. Don't listen to her. So you guys are here for school. Yeah we're studying marine biology. What is that? It's the study of sea animals. - Cool. - What do you feed dolphins? Uh, we don't we let the dolphins just chase little fish in the ocean. It's really important that we don't feed the dolphins. They will grow to expect that people need to feed them. And they need to depend on each other to hunt as a pod. You hear that, and they're dangerous. Nah man, they're the most peaceful creatures in the sea. Nice, loving creatures man nah. - Humans are far worse. - Oh in every way... humanly possible. What if one came here alone? - They rarely separate from the pod... - Yeah it's not really common. Wait, what's going on? What's happening? Let's say... We... might... know... someone... who... May have met a dolphin. By itself. A dolphin approached you guys? On Taino beach? Is that bad? He likes us. He must be separated. Sure you all didn't just see a big ol' manatee or something? If you see it again can you let us know. It might need our help. Actually... you can come with us tomorrow I mean, he'll come around? Uh. We got class. I don't have class, so I'm game. Cool. - Hey guys! - Hey Sunshine! Here try this. I still have no idea what conch is, but here we go. Ah, there he goes. - How is it? - Mmm. Right? Not bad. - I kinda like it. - Taino Island man. Welcome to Taino beach. Your hair is so pretty. Ah, thank you. My mom taught me how to do it as a kid. She did my hair all the time. - Excuse me guys. - Is she OK? Hey water bug. Please go back inside. - What's wrong? - I want mom to come back. I miss her too. She is here with us. I see her everyday when I look at you. But mom never taught me to fish tail. I'll tell you what, Why don't you let me learn how to do the fish tail. I'll make the best looking fish tail you've ever seen. It'll be a disaster. It'll be the best looking disaster you've ever seen. Dad you're such a cheeseball. And proud of it. Come on, you know it'll look good. You wanna go back and join everyone? Yeah. Dom! Hey! Dom! Where this boy is? What is it Naz? How 'bout you and me work this out man? What your problem is? I didn't touch your lines. My man. The lines been cut, and I know it was you! Someone cut your lines? - No. - Stop lying! Hey man not in here. Let me tell you something. You try to take money out my pocket. Food out my children mouth. And you have me to deal with. Uh, Excuse me. Moe coming through, uh, Cap... - There ain't no need for this. Let's go. - Moe. Nobody here cut your buoys. - Alright. - Let me see you in the ocean... - Take a walk boys! - Let's go, yeah. - I see everything that go on. - Oh, OK big guy. That's just so messed up. You alright bud? Watch out man! Locals man. OK! What's up? You know you're mom spent a lot time out here too. She loved swimming out here. Your mom got you swimming at three years old. I couldn't get either one of y'all out of the water that summer. That was y'alls thing. When I put you down at night, I had to check you for gills. Cause you were like a little fish. She... She would know how to get you back in the water. She knew everything. She's right here with us bud. She's always with us. She's right here. She's right there buddy. Come on. Let's go get some sleep. Dad. - Are you awake? - No. No. What? What are you two doing? Yeah the dolphin you said. Alright. You guys cook me breakfast? You guys! Hey cap. Trying to look like a rich man boat on this side of the island. You see that over there? Right, right there. Right there. Yeah you see that? Way over there man. You get your sea legs yet captain? Yes ma'am. Never lost them. I was raised on a boat. Been on it since I was a little kid. So where's this little renegade at? Well if he's spending time at the docks, He shouldn't be too far out. He's probably lonely. He's gotta be around here somewhere. He probably saw your happy faces at the dock and wanted to play Dad! There he is! There he is! - Look at that! - Dad do you see him! Look at him! Whoa! He's getting some height! Awesome! Hey there guy. What are you doing all alone? Hey! That's not the buoy we used before. Where'd you get that? He chewed right through the rope. That looks like a lobster trap line. Yeah and whoever set it won't be happy. Hey. Those belong to the fisherman. We shouldn't be playing with that now should we big boy. Dolphin's usually travel in groups like a family, they're called pods. What happened to your family? They need social interaction. I honestly think it could be loneliness bring him this close to us. Can we bring it back to its family? We could try. They use echo location to talk to each other. They can hear up to 200 meters out. If a... Pod passes, we can try to get him closer to earshot. Then we'll go. Don't worry, we'll get you back to your pod. Oh no. What do they want? Come on. Come on boy just let it go. Come on boy. Let it go. Please drop it Echo. Drop the buoy! Oh no. Hey we're out of her now! Now now, come on, come on. - Come on, come on. - I'm getting you guys away from that buoy - and those fishermen now. - No we can't he has the buoy in his mouth! I need you to, look, just drop it, please. - Give us the buoy. - Come on. Give me the buoy. Give. Give. Give me the buoy. Give me the buoy. - Give me the buoy. - Gentle, gentle. - Give me the buoy. - Dad watch out you're gonna fall! - Give me the bou... - Whoa! - Don't let them see him. - Hide him dad. Hide. Hide. Shhh. Shhh. Hey Nova! Looks like you got more recruits for the T.U.C.C. - Everything cool. - You didn't even introduce me to your new friend, man. Get lost Moe! That's how you can carry on over. Alright. Oh man cap you see that? Man she ain't on our run man. Everything cool Nova, we'll catch you next time. Good job boy. Hey pull me back to the boat can you do that? Which one of you? Yes I knew it. So..what I'm actually doing is calibrating this, gauge, because the last time I dove, - I ran out of oxygen. - How y'all doing guys? There we go. What up girls! - Hey! - Hey guys! How was that dive? - It was alright. - See anything interesting? - Same old, same old. - Not really this time. What are you guys doing? I'm trying to make sure that I don't explode, the next time I dive. How do you find a dolphin pod in Taino island? Uhh, OK So... Taino is cool because it is completely surrounded by coral. And it's why pirates actually love this island Because there's a giant coral reef that surrounds the entire island. This. Taino island. And... Say this is the reef. Goes all around the island, all zig zaggy. Except in two spots. So back in the day coral grew so high that ships who were coming to the island for the first time didn't know. And the ships would hit the island and sink. That's why there's all this buried treasure. All around here. So all of the dolphins are swimming around here now. That probably got Echo, stuck in the inside of the reef. Because you know it's low tide during the day, And high tide during the night. And the dolphins feed only in the day really. And so what probably happened with our dolphin. Is, He got separated the tide rose he got blocked by the coral. And he couldn't escape so all of his friends, ditched him. cause they're not good friends. Don't do that to your friends. What about echo location? Pods not even going to get close enough so that they can hear each other. - Yeah that's the thing. - Yeah cause this is, the great wall of China. Two openings. We have another opening on the south west part, that's where all the fishermen go out, and yeah majority of them live there too. And, so we gonna have to try and focus, - get something to focus them to come in. - Got it yeah. Cause they're feeding, they already have enough fish on the outside of the reef. We could do that we can think of something. So we just need to find something to attract them here. Exactly other than fish. Looks like we found our porpoise. Oh my god, I love that so much. Keep it up, I love the dad jokes. Hey Collard. Collard what's going on big brother. - Hey. - Hey! - You guys are off today? - Nah, big brother. No dives today, we have to get word out on this. Oh yeah I've seen a few of these around. - What's going on? - Young blood Luke, he found a bottle nose out there on Taino man. Nice. Coolest animal in the ocean huh? Yeah definitely. He's alone separated from his pod. Yeah we've been out canvassing the area with these flyers. Hopefully someone seen some dolphins and we can get this little guy joined back with a pod. Yeah good idea, I'll hang these up in the shop. The marina's right there, you guys should really check around maybe ask some of the captains. You think if we go by Xanadu beach or by Taino beach or something. - They seen any dolphins out that area lately? - I haven't been there in a minute. It wouldn't hurt to try. Think there's any way to talk to the guys running the dive boats. Maybe they've seen some dolphins out diving. Yeah I can make a few calls. Shouldn't be a problem. Yeah man, thanks man. - Always good to see you brother. - Thanks Collard! - I appreciate it. - Anytime. Where? - Where'd they go? - Where they go to. Hey! Hey! You forgetting something? Boy, y'all got a lot of nerve cutting my lines. - We found them, we found them like that. - Find them? Boy kid, if there's one thing I can smell from a mile away is a liar. We can smell you from a mile away. We're just here to help our friend. Your friend is who? It's a dolphin. - Dolphin? - Oh, you like dolphins kid. Dolphins! They pest! - You know what pest get right? - Hey what's going on? Kids come here. Just teaching them marine etiquette finer points. Ah man look who it is. Where he come from? I do not want you talking to my kids. If you got a problem you talk to me. And who you supposed to be? Captain planet? Come on kids, let's go. If I gotta watch my traps, then you better watch your back. I wish I could get in there with you dude but... I can't swim. Whatever. You wouldn't understand. How do we even know if he's going to join the Pod. Something truly special about these creatures is that, Even outside of their immediate family they associate as if they're all family. Are they gonna like, accept him. Even if they don't know him. Of course, the population structure in pods are always changing because of age and gender But, A pod would accept a lone dolphin based on their common understanding that a sense of belonging is all they need. Why can't he just stay with us then? Forever! Instead of living with dolphins. Sky, they don't survive on their own. They need, a group to protect each other someone they can depend on. A family. No it's just a close up. So what's the Marines like? The marines? We study marine biology. Close! Well you guys are oceanography students. - Yeah. - You know someone in the program that could help out? Simmons would have helped us. Nah man, that guy is crazy. Simmons man, Simmons is mad crazy, nah. Crazy but he would have helped. He was our marine bio teacher. It was, hotly debated as to whether he was an actual employee of the school. He might have just snuck into an office and then sat there until somebody told him to leave. Which was a long time. He was freaking old. He spent most of his life experimenting with ways to communicate with to dolphins. Uhh, let me show you. - Check this out, this is Simmons. - Yes! Remember this? Is he playing a piano underwater? The man! Yes... that's a 1200 pound piano. It was an absolute blast getting that onto a boat. You know that's one of his first concepts. And his first disaster. He was trying to make music underwater. He had this theory that, dolphins respond to music the same way that we do. They... enjoy the rhythm and the tone and, it's just you have to have a giant music box to be able to, test it out. Man that's underwater though ain't no instrument work underwater. Come on man. He was never proven to be wrong. How do you play music underwater long enough to happen by a pod and see if it works. Have any of them worked? Uh, the whistler. The whistler worked. It cost him his job, but it worked. I knew you were say that. What's the whistler? The whistler was a device that replicated language patterns he found in Cetacea And Simmons found a way to project it long range without any harmful effects of sonar. Let's get it. I mean we could try and get it but, it's underwater. Oh. Yeah right before he left the island he sank his boat and, uh, along with all of his projects. In his last days he was refurbishing old musical equipment scrapping all kinds of boat parts from wherever on the island. Well rumor on the island was that the fishermen did it to Simmons they were trying to put a hold on the grouper trapping. Well, where's his boat at? It's a quarter mile out of his property. Way off shore. And about forty feet below. Guys those coordinates are not like exact. But dude we need time to locate this thing and we only have... - Yeah. - One hour on a full tank. It's hard to find. I mean if we had more divers. But there's, there's no guarantee that the corrosion hasn't just destroyed all of the parts anyways. It'll take forever just to put them back together and see if they even work. We have to at least try I mean... If we don't try, we don't succeed. Right? I mean yeah I guess. Ahh. Kind of seems like a lost cause at this point. It's probably in pieces by now. You guys don't know Simmons this dude was... bananas. There's no telling if this is even remotely possible. I scuba. You have your divers cert? Oh yeah. Spring break, Caba. Didn't we all? You know my wife used to say, you can sit around your whole life with just your toes in the water or you can dive in. I say let's do it. I'm in. Me too. You got me, I'm in. Alright. - Let's get it! - Great! 6 AM tomorrow? Ooh. Yup. Alright. Is that good? Little tight. Well, stop skipping leg day. There is no such thing as leg day. Rule number one, steady breathing. If he stays with me he'll survive. Can I get that in writing. This is the place guys. Hey sweetie, if you see any fishing boats out here you blow the horn. I can hear it underwater I'll be right up. My hero. Uh, remember you gotta take a big step out frontwards. Frontwards. Clint, turn around dude. Chop. Chop. Chopped and screwed. Chop. Chop. Chopped and screwed. Chop. Chop. Chopped and screwed. Disappoint my father. Luke look there he is! Hey Echo! Oh no you got another one. Echo stop with the buoys! Those aren't yours! No more fetch crazy people are trying to kill you for this stuff. Guys! Guys! Echo can hear this! Echo can hear this under the water! Boss! Boss! Look what they doing! Man it looks like you got a problem there! Boss I need some money so I can put fuel in my rig and get out there and check my trap. No no no, you gotta bring lobsters in if you want money. Come on I got my family, I just need a little advance so I can put fuel in my boat. - Sorry. - So I can get out there and check Sorry man we're not a charity here! There ain't no way you need to bring lobsters in here. You're the tenth one here today looking for charity. Baby girl, I love you more than diamonds and pearls. - Babes thats you? - Just what my weary eyes needed. Only girl more beautiful than the island itself. - See my baby. - And you, The only fishermen she'd ever let kiss her. - Mm mmm, what you say baby? - Everything's good. Feeling any better? Everything's good baby, you alright? - Where I belong now. - Good. Hey Moe! You been keeping my boy safe today! Well you see we back in one piece right? All I can ask for. - OK. - Hey! - What's on your mind. - I was at the market earlier. - I overheard some of the other guys talking. - Yeah? 'Bout what? They're saying that someone's been cutting traps? Really? Yeah, you don't be hearing that? Uh uh. Right Moe? You hear anything about traps getting cut? No not that I know of, uh uh. No sir, nope. I know some of the other trappers are struggling right now. - Yeah. - And I even overheard Roscoe saying that he can't afford to get new traps to start over. There you go again with your doting baby. Everything cress, alright. Me and Malik just come from doing a big haul. See me and Moe getting the chop ready we're gonna head back out. Everything will be just fine baby, OK? Trust me baby. These big hands can hold it all. OK, but you know, If we need I can take some shifts at the bungalow. The only thing, we need, is for you to feel better baby. You gotta get plenty of rest, stay nice and healthy. And bring my progeny into the world That's the future king of Taino. Nah, just the prince. His daddy's already the king. You know it. Look here, I want you go home, rest up. Take a nice little bath. I'll be home later. Me and Moe can finish all this work. OK well, - You ain't gotta tell me twice. - Aaah. Bye bye Moe. You don't mind if I carry cap for a drink. Like one, just one. - Or six! - Man don't lie to her. More than six, I'll bring him home. Cap. Cap? Naz. Cap! Oh come on man, talk to me man it's Moe. Man whatever you need me to do, you know I got yo' back. For you and the future king. Yo, Moe. We gonna have to build some bigger traps brother. Let's head out! Let's do it! And I mean tonight! This is so cool. I can't believe it actually worked. So did Echo really hear it? Oh yeah. He came right up to me. And as he got close, I could see him dancing. So, a p-a... a pod can... like faraway can hear this? Well, this is a little one. And Echo was only a hundred feet away. I'll tell you what, Simmons was on to something. So he wasn't crazy. Maybe a good crazy. Alright, time for bed. Scoot down. There we go. Dad I've been reading a lot about dolphins lately. Really? They speak their own language, with clicking patterns to talk to each other. - I didn't know that. - I really hope the whistler works. Me too baby girl, me too. We are gonna find a way to get Echo, back with a pod. 'Kay. You just need to believe in yourself. I believe in you. Thanks dad. You're welcome. Hey dude. How do you even swim in your sleep? You're in the water nonstop. Nova said you learned how to swim before you were even born. Kind of like my mom did When I was a kid. She taught me how to swim. But ever since she passed I felt like if I fall in I would sink. Think I would sink? What? What? Stop. Hey watch it! I'll... Ah. Yeah I know you want to play. But I can't. I just can't Can you just be serious for a second? Echo I need your serious face. Seriously. Oh wow Echo. Thank you so much. Well who gets to swim with a real life dolphin It's now or never. Don't let me fall under. I mean it dude. OK, this was a bad idea! Aaah! Well this was stupid! Ah! Not so bad. I gotta... I gotta tell dad. I was swimming! Luke! Hey you got in the water! I remember swimming with mom. It was amazing! I want to be back on the swim team. Yes! That's what Im talking about. Come here. I'm proud of you buddy. Oh! Look at Echo! I guess you weren't swimming alone were you? Probably wouldn't call it swimming. Echo was probably doing circles around you, huh? Hey cap. Looks like little man getting close to that dolphin you know. Buddy, looks like our line ain't been getting cut. It been getting chewed. Look like we might have to keep an eye on Yankee boy with that new fishy friend. - I'll keep an eye on him. - Be sure you do that. Can't afford for no one to take food out of our mouth. Not at all cap. Roger that. Leave it to me. Uhm... Guys I'm sorry the, the whistler didn't work. It's too corroded I can't, ugh, I can't figure it out what to do but I'm gonna keep trying I want you to know that, and just keep your head up. We'll figure this out. I have an idea! - Look right here look! - Pipes are tied to the boat. We throw them overboard. So the pipes, - stay on the rope. - OK. So they're hanging over the side. Cause they're all tied up to the things! Yeah that things! Yes the cleats! But all the cleats! Cause you're gonna need a lot of pipes. Cause they all gotta bang together. Yeah like, Bong! Bong! So the pipes are hanging on the side of the boat. And we can totally hear it when metal clangs underwater. So you know dolphins can hear way better! Echo location! And Nova said they can hear up to 200 meters away. And the Ocean is always moving. And the boat can just stay at the opening to let the pipes play And jangle together so the dolphins can hear. Like a chime. Exactly it'll do what the whistler idea was meant to be. Well the whistler the clicks were in a musical rhythm, like Bump, bump bump, bump bump, bump bump. What better music to a dolphin then the rhythm of the ocean. Okay, but guys wait a second. It seems a little far fetched though right? No! Not after everything you guys taught us. Uh, I think I'm gonna have to go with the kids on this one guys. Uh, if we get to toe this instrument out in front of Taino, east though, east of the opening, away from all the big freight noise. Yeah, I think it'll work. Be like, bait without a hook. Yeah man, if a pods around they gonna hear it. Echo needs our help! We only have two days left. Okay, so what do we do?
