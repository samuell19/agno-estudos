Come on little lady. Let's get you taken care of. Paul, you were supposed to be back at 8 o'clock I was worried. Help me. Oh, what happened? Here, use this for support. Did you find it hurt or did you hit it? Oh Martha, she ran out in front of the car. I couldn't stop in time. All right, or were you asleep at the wheel? Careful! Turn on those lights. All right. Just a minute, Paul - All right. - Be careful there. Watch her neck. Okay. Okay. Easy now. Okay. Easy does it, Paul. Okay. - Bring me some alcohol. - Okay. Looks like we are going to have to operate. Get me some K-9 plasma out of the refrigerator, and an IV too. No, you're going to have to connect it. Hang the tube up there. Now insert the needle right into the tube here. Insert it? Okay. - Alcohol. - Okay. Is there anything else? No. It's fine, Thank you. I uh... I'll get some coffee that I've made. - I'll get it for you. - Fine. Good. You've got more than a ruptured spleen, little mother. I don't think you're going to make it. Maybe your pups will have a chance. Paul. Is there anything else I can do? Get Gordon on the phone. Is the dog going to make it? I don’t know. Put it on the speaker. No, no. Answer it in the morning. It could be important. - Okay? - Thank you. I'll check back with you. Hello. Gordon? This is dad. I want you to go to the research hospital and get me... What is it? You're not sick, are you. No, no, no. I'm fine. - Get 20 micrograms of Thyroxcin, 30... - Hold it a minute. - Now, tell me again. 20 micrograms of Thyroxcin... 30 million units of Penicillin... And 10 units of K-9 blood. And hurry up! I'll be there as quick as I can, dad. So, what's happening? I don't know, but he called. First time since the accident. He's really excited about something. - Yeah, so was I. - What are you doing? It's called getting dressed. First you put on your... Get back to bed before you both catch cold. Oh, nothing doing. We have unfinished business. You know, on the way home, that lookout point on Mulholland Drive - would be the perfect place to stop off. - Helen! I'm very adaptable as well as being very sexy. Being pregnant does that you know, makes you sexier. God give me strength! Don't give it a second thought, darling, it is all taken care of. You see God is a liberated female and she is on my side. It's open. - What's going on, dad? - I'll tell you in a minute. What happened to her? She ran out in front of the car. I couldn't stop. I'm trying to save her pups. You mean these things are alive? Two of them are now. They don't resemble their mother very much. Well you didn't exactly look like Robert Redford at that stage, either. They're alive, and that makes them beautiful. - She's going to live, isn't she? - I don't know. She's holding her own, - but, you know how it is. - You are a mess. Why don't you go get cleaned up. Yeah, I'll be back in a minute. Thanks. Is my future protégé behaving himself? - Oh, hardly. He's already starting to kick. Do you want a feel? Yeah! Hey, what does Dr. Cameron say? He says you're going to be a perfectly healthy grandfather. Grandfather! Hmm! I'll be back in a minute. Oh, god. It's good to see him working again. You know he hasn't been in the lad since mother died. This is the first time that I have ever been in the lab. It is unreal. Oh, Nicole, where in all this are you? My sister's still here, Paul. With us. No she isn't. And I'm still guilty. Does that make it easier for you? No! Do you still resent the fact that I walked away without a scratch? Nicole's gone. And I'm still here. You can't accept that, Martha. And either can I. So you see, we agree. It's as simple as that. It looks like you lost another one. Oh no. You two go on home. It's going to be a long night. I'm sure you've got better things to do. - How about some golf next week? - Good idea. I'll call. And if you don't, I will. Little mother, we must try something new. Maybe your last pup will have a chance after all. Only one foetus left. Five weeks or so developed. The mother is providing life support, but she can't live over twelve hours and the foetus has no chance of survival on its own. So, in an attempt to speed its development at 3:05 am, I commenced intravenous injection of of placental lactogen. Placental lactogen, is a growth hormone, Nicole, that is Dr. Nicole Holliston, and I were experimenting with at the time of her death. It will either cause rapid development of the foetus due to accelerated growth of molecular cell structures, or the patient will die within hours. Placental lactogen consists of polypeptide fragments with a C Lucyne marker, and has two desified bridges. Give me a few more minutes, little mother. Just a few. Christ, not yet! You're alive! Like it or not you're getting one hell of a chance at life. I hope you like it... Number 1. Because of prematurity, and to alleviate possible shock, I place Number 1 in an isolette at 10:40 am. The growth hormone is discontinued, but nourishment is being fed intravenously. The sample specimen cells seems to be without defect, and the growth pattern normal. I decided to recommence intravenous feeding of placental lactogen. the growth hormone, to study further how the rapid growth progresses. At 1:40 am on the 24th, the puppy is now six weeks or so developed but is only two days and 15 hours old. Come here... With the growth hormone is administered the accelerated growth is constant. When it's withdrawn the growth pattern immediately returns to normal, with no apparent harm to the cells. However, I've decided not to release the results of this experiment, until I'm sure, placental lactogen, the growth hormone, has no side effects. Placental lactogen discontinued. Cell activity dropped again to normal. Number 1 has attained growth comparable to one year. Is still in light tranquilsed state. Will attempt to stimulate the consciousness by injection of Nalyne. Heel. Sit. Down. Stay. Come. Sit. I didn't think hat dog stood a chance. Are you going to keep her? Yes. Heel. It's a shame you weren't able to save any of the puppies. Yes, I'm sorry too. But failure is what keeps us geniuses from becoming too vain. Come. Someone forgot to tell her that dogs and children always like me. She's obviously been well trained. You don't need me. Thanks for your help. Oh, I'm sorry Number 1, I forgot the time. Go get your dinner. Now put the dish away and go to bed. Number 1’s ability to learn in is extraordinary, it may be an accidental. side effect of the drug? I have decided to attempt under controlled conditions. a similar experiment, with a human embryo. Stay. I won't be long. Impossible! Difficult... but not impossible. You'd be jeopardising your career, your whole life. The results can be worth it. Nothing is worth going to jail for. That's debatable. Nicole had three miscarriages before we had Gordon. They were all genetically perfect. But they died because they came into the world too soon. Paul, I understand. Believe me, I do. And I know your dedication. But it is morally... questionable to experiment with a living being. A six month foetus is a living being with a chance of survival outside of the womb, but twelve to fourteen weeks has no hope whatsoever. I'm not asking for anything that has a chance for life on its own. An accident where the mother is dying is what I need. An abortion even! Listen to me! Twenty years work is beginning to take shape. The children that Nicole and I didn't have will in their own way live. Now help me, Jim. Please. Maybe. And only if it does not put me or the hospital in a vulnerable position. Blood type A. That may take a little while. I'll let you know. I have a temporary life support container in the car. I'll get it. Betrays a certain quiet self-confidence on your part. I knew you were a fervent doctor before you became a fervent administrator. Dr. Carroll, surgery please. Dr. Carroll... Dr. Schrimm, obstetrics please. Dr. Schrimm. Paul? Jim. Listen... Paul, I've got an attempted suicide down here that's not going to make it. She's fourteen, fifteen weeks pregnant, and the right blood type. Paul, what is it? What's with the ambulance? Are you doing an experiment? Paul? May I help you? Please, Paul. - I'd like to. - No. Paul... Wel... You just go and do it yourself, and get your own sandwich. The difference between the canine and human circulatory tract and cell structure, makes it difficult to say what effect the growth hormone will have on the human foetus. Chances for the experiment to succeed, are minimal because of the immature development of the foetus. It's estimate, that the foetus has a chance of reaching the five month development stage before termination of life. If enough is learned from this, and other experiments it's possible that within a few years, placental lactogen can be used to save miscarried infants, and allow them to live. Continuous life support, began at 11:50 pm on February 5th. Heart beat and other vital signs normal. 10 am, February 6. The foetus showed signs of hypoxia. I made an adjustment in the oxygen saturation to stabilise. 2:15 pm, February 7. Growth pattern approximately 30 to 1. Each 24 hour span appears to equal one month's growth in the mother's womb. I'm amazed. February 8 6:45 pm. Foetus size is now equivalent to an eight month normal pregnancy. It's incredible! Growth hormone discontinued, and the baby transferred to an isolette at 9:10 pm, February 9th. Her heart beats is steady, lungs are expanded and clear. This is the most advanced step in foetus research in the last ten years. After running tests tomorrow, I... must decide the best way of breaking the news to the medical association, and transferring the subject to the clinic, without implicating Dr. Winston, or his hospital. I have no delusions about the legal problems I will have to face. A terrifying thing is taking place. Despite the discontinuance of the growth hormone, the infant is still developing at accelerated rate. February 13, 1:00 pm. I'm still unable to arrest the child's rapid growth. The development rate is now approximately one year to each 24 hour period. And seems to be accelerating with each hour. February 16, 2:00 pm. Rapid growth still uncontrolled. Rate now about two years for every 24 hour period. I've worked for 25 years to save life, and now, if the girl lives, I've... robbed her of a part of her life. I can't even justify bringing others in for consultation. It's my responsibility alone. February 21, 3:40 am. There has been a marked change in the cell activity over the last three hours. The rapid cell growth is easing off, but the existing cells are now aging and dying at a terrifying rate. My God, will it ever end? The cell action change over from growth to aging is significant. Preliminary tests indicate rapid aging may be receptive to certain combinations of DNA blocking agents. 30cc of an anti-metabolic solution, retarded agent for three hours, and then became ineffective. February 23, 1:00 am. I administered 50cc of 5 Hydroxidopamine which would be effective if given in a massive dose, however, such a high dose would cause heart arrest and death within 24 hours. February 24, 7:00 am. Administering 50cc of Methotrexate, a risk because it's a very strong drug, and highly addictive. If methotrexate doesn't arrest the rapid aging, I have no choice but to transfer the girl to the research clinic. I can't cope with it any longer. It's been 19 hours since I administered Methotrexate. I think I've found the antidote! Accelerated aging has ceased, with no withdrawal symptoms. I a, for the first time, optimistic. Why should Number 1 and the girl react differently to the placental lactogen? I've run tests on both. The main difference seems to be that the puppy foetus depended on its mother, but existed on an artificial system. It's now been 36 hours since the Methotrexate injection. Aging has still slowed. (COUGHS) Aging has still slowed to a normal level. If it's permanently stabilised and she's normal in all respects I shall keep her with me and prepare her as much as possible for the outside world. And that'll be quite a task. The tranquilizers are discontinued. I will raise her to consciousness with a series of Nalyne injections. I have no idea as to the outcome, but I've... I've done all I can. Also, I'll begin some conscious teaching at this time. ... there are 16. 16 and 16 are 32. 32 and 32... are 64. Let us repeat: 1 plus 1 are 2. 2 + 2 = 4. 4 and 4 are eight. 8 and 8 are 16. 16 and 16 are 32. 2 + 2 = 4. 4 and 4 are eight. 8 and 8 are 16. 16 and 16 are 32. 32 and 32 are 64. Let us repeat: 1 plus 1 are 2. You won't understand what I'm about to say, but... through my own inadequacy, you have missed the most wondrous part of your life, and that's called growing up. I shall do my best to make up to you what's been lost Victoria... Yes... Victoria. Do you remember... any of the lessons? 1 and 1 are 2. 2 + 2 = 4... 4 + 4 = 8 8 + 8... The patient... Victoria, awakened approximately 11:30. She seems alert and upon preliminary examination, functioning at a normal level. Heart beat is normal, lungs clear Noticeable laxity of muscles from immobility. Six...teen... Six...teen... No, no, no... Six...teen... Six... teen... Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two. Sixteen and sixteen are thirty-two. Thirty-two and thirty-two are sixty-four. Let us repeat... 1 and 1 are 2. 2 + 2 = 4. 4 + 4 = 8 8 + 8 = 16. 16 + 16 = 32. 32 + 32 = 64. Let us repeat. 1 + 1 = 2. 2 + 2 = 4. 4 + 4 = 8. 8 + 8 = 16. Martha, you may as well stay with Helen until I get back. - Okay. Take care of yourself. - I will. - Oh, and be sure to call us from Denver. - Oh, yes I will. I'll call you when I'm coming back. You're going to be so busy thinking up a nursery for my grandson. You won't even miss me. Oh, I just remembered... it would be perfect for a little boy's room... Wait till I get home and I'll... Victoria. Victoria. Victoria. They're gone. Now we start learning to communicate. With the house to ourselves, I'm trying to explain the rudiments of life. It's easy to forget the simple things, the things we take for granted are are totally unknown to her. She is incredibly perceptive, her mind like a sponge, open and ready to absorb everything. Yet there's a plus factor in all of this. While most of us are capable of using a fraction of our brain capacity she is able to use hers 100%, or damn close to it! There are no barriers, no unconscious blockages. Perhaps because she missed the social and environmental restrictions we have imposed on us when we grew up. It's not an unpleasant task to teach such a willing pupil. Continued tests indicate the aging is progressing at a normal level, and there are no signs of addiction or withdrawal from the Methotrexate. I'm terribly relieved. - This is a microscope. - Microscope. Her intelligence and comprehension are overwhelming. A combination of total recall and the ability to utilise information logically. She is not developing emotionally as rapidly, as mentally, but, I assume this will come with time. There are your cells, and they're all normal. Hello? Paul? Where are you? Are you being properly devilish? No, I'm still in Denver. Tell Martha to enjoy herself. Take a rest from the house till I get back. I may stop off in Salt Lake City for a little while. Yes... I'll let you know. What? No, no, I'm fine. Love to Gordon. Goodbye. What did you think of it? An interesting story but not very logical. This Bible is much more than just a story, it's an account of the way the world actually began. From what I've learned, that's impossible. You're not alone in thinking that way. But to many the... moral values ​​are what's important. - Moral values? - Yes, the... In time. Victoria... I like my name! Why am I called that? Because you were a victory for both of us. Come outside. There's a whole world for you to see. Were there times when you were afraid that I wouldn't be a victory? From the beginning! You see, I never really expected you to be born. And then your life took hold, wouldn't let go. It moved at such speed I didn't think I could stop. You know there was a chance there where you could have been lived and died of old age without ever knowing you'd existed. Couldn't you have gone for help? If the Methotrexate hadn't worked I would have, but thank God it did! Why thank God? What would have been so bad about going for help? I'd have put you into clinic There you'd have been a strange happening, an exhibit. Something under glass to be looked at, examined, experimented with. - A freak? - A freak. - I would have hated that. - I know. Can it happen now? No. Oh, one chance in a million, but... that's as good as saying no. Your cells are normal. You're not supposed to eat that. A flower is supposed to be looked at and admired. Like this. See. There. Still, we're going to have to tell people about you. I can't keep you secret much longer. That's going to be a problem for you Victoria. I'm sorry for that. You see... You are unique. You may never happen again. And from what you tell me, I may not have happened at all. Live and die without ever being. Yes, perhaps if you'd been taken from the womb when you were more developed... Say six or seven months, the growth hormone wouldn't have reacted as it did. But that's something we will never know. A six-month foetus has a chance of life on its own. To experiment and fail at that stage would be murder. And that I will not do. But still you ought to tell others about me. Still I am to be the guinea pig. No! I won't allow it to go that far. Who am I, Paul? Who were my parents? Your mother gave her name as Ann Smith. She died shortly after you were taken from her. And her real name? I don't know... They were never able to trace her. My father? Your mother never would say. Who knows about your experiment? About me? - No-one. - I really don't exist, do I? I'm a non person. February 23rd, 1:00 am. I administered 50cc of 5 Hydroxetamine, which would be effective if given in a massive dose, however... such a massive dose would cause heart arrest and death within 24 hours. February 24. 7:00 am. Administering 50cc of methotrexate. A risk, because it's a very strong drug, and highly addictive. If Methotrexate doesn't arrest the rapid aging, I have no choice but to transfer the girl to the research clinic. It's been nineteen hours since I administered Methotrexate... Accelerated aging has ceased. Wit no withdrawal symptoms. I am for the first time optimistic. What are you doing here? Paul. Paul. Paul Paul! Paul, it's Martha! Paul, someone was here. Who? Martha, she said. - Did she tell you? - No! She called out her name. I hid in the lab but she didn't come in. Good. Good. Nobody can see you. Here, take that in the house. Go on, go on. - Paul. - What? Maybe we could go away somewhere. I should like to see some of the things you've told me about before... Before what? You know, when you have to tell others about me. All right. we'll go this afternoon. It's time you experienced being around other people. Thank you! I'll try not to embarrass you. Thank you! - Do you think we'll ever go back? - I don't know. Wasn't two weeks enough? It was wonderful, but too short. I loved that when you talked with anyhow, the plazas, shops, the people, the marvellous old missions... It was all exciting and beautiful. But sometimes I felt I said the wrong things, or asked the wrong questions. Once or twice people stared at me and I... -Did I make a mistake, Paul? - No. No, you didn't make any mistakes. It's just that people don't see the beauty around them... Sometimes they take it all for granted. Your enthusiasm made them aware of what they were missing. - Is that good? - Very good. We'll pick up Martha on the way home and you can meet Gordon and Helen. We're almost there. Let's hear it. Victoria Spencer from Denver Colorado. Parents. deceased - Age: 25 years. Unmarried. - Studied where? At the University of Colorado. The College of Applied Sciences and the School of Medicine. It was established by territorial legislate in 1861. - But the first corner stone was not laid until... - Hold it, hold it. Just say where you went to school, don't give a dissertation. - Remember, never volunteer. - Okay. Now, how did we meet? You were in need of a research assistant, and I was recommended by a chemistry professor. - His name? - Dr. William Bigman. Good. Oh, oh, a party. Now is not the time. Paul. This is what is called making one's debut, isn't it? What a surprise! Welcome! I didn't know you were at home, otherwise we'd have come over. Well, we just arrived. Victoria, I'd like you to meet my daughter-in-law, my son. Gordon, Helen, this is Victoria Spencer, my new research assistant. Delighted to meet you, Victoria. Oh, let me take your hat. Gordon, get them some drinks. Yes. I think you've met Mike Simon. - Yes of course! - My father. - Victoria Spencer, Mike Simon. - Victoria, delighted. Martha. Paul stopped off on the way home and he has a lady with him. - A what? A lady? - A new assistant. I think you're going to find working with Dr. Holliston very exciting. I'm sure. ...we went to this fantastic... - Was I all right? - Just fine. Paul. I'm surprised. You didn't call me when you got home. What are you talking about? I went to the house two weeks ago and that dog of yours was there. Oh, yes. I was in and out in the one day. I didn't find it necessary to tell anyone. Oh, Martha, meet Victoria Spencer. She;ll be working with me. Victoria, this is my sister-in-law, Martha Douglas. Paul has spoken of you so many times. Really? I'm afraid he hasn't mentioned you. Where are you staying, Miss Spencer? She'll be staying at the house. Of course. I'll come home with you today. Tell me when you're ready and I'll get my things. No you don't. You helped me claim this collection and I'm not going to let you desert me in the middle of it. I'll take you home tomorrow. Oh, by the way, George just came in and he's looking for you. - Oh. I... - Excuse me. Where did you study, Miss Spencer? - At the University of Colorado. - Colorado, that's my old Alma mater. Tell me is Dr. Henley still head of clinical medicine there?? I heard he was retired. He was a cantankerous old bastard you know, but a damn fine teacher. I look forward even more to working with Dr. Holliston. I still have much to learn. Less and less. Excuse me. I've...been in a holding pattern over you all day. What shall I do about it? Look, while we're mulling over all options, have some wine. It's an Italian vintage, probably made in Algeria. out of bull's blood rubbing alcohol. If a man with your taste and intelligence enjoys it, who am I to refuse? The sun shines on these dreary people as if they were worth a floodlight inspection. But for me it's Oscar Wilde, you see. Give me deeper darkness, money is not made in the light. Excuse me, I think it was George Bernard Shaw. First act of "Heartbreak House". Of course! I was just testing you and your past. Beauty plus intelligence. Very sensuous. We're going to enjoy a rousingly good hump. Hump? - He had a ragged old coat on... - Yes. You refer to a favourite slang word that the Elizabethan's used for fornication. I've read much on the subject. You can talk to your computers like that, but not my guests. Do you make computers? No, I make them work. I manage "Teletext International Systems." In my spare time, when it's not confusing Shaw with Wilde. Or rabble as usual with bad taste. I'm surrounded... therefore I surrender to all women. One of these days I'm going to remember what a presumptuous son-of-a-bitch is Collier is and not invite him around. He's only obsessed with a perfectly normal urge. Oh, so I've read. Victoria, you are unique. And totally charming. Come on, let me introduce you to some nice people. Well, let's say nicer people. Check Mate. Again... No, not really. I could have given you my queen and both rooks and still have whipped you. You may be right. No, that's not correct. This is feasible you could have given the queen and one rook but not the queen and the both rooks. Chess is one of the last bastions of male chauvinism. Would you like to challenge the champion? I've never played. She has never played and yet she tells me that I'm wrong! I've read the rules in the book on chess. And a very interesting book by Alekhine. Oh! I had a friend once, never skied, He read every book there was. First day out on the slopes, broke both his ankles. This is much safer. You just sit down sweetheart and I'll show you the rules of the game. Thank you. See this little doo-dah? That is a pawn. Now he can only move one space at a time. - Except on his first move. - I know. Shall we play? Well, they used a a pacifier, but they refused to be humiliated by by discussing it. They wouldn't go that far, not even for science! Paul, your Victoria is something extraordinary. You should see whats she's doing to Frank Riley! - I love it! - I hope he doesn't beat her too badly. Dr. Ruthers, I read your column every day. It's wonderful. - Thank you, that's so nice. - Excuse me. Pardon me. Finally! Excuse me. Wonderful! If you don't keep quiet, this game is off! Quiet! Check. - She's got him! That's amazing. What a move. Beautiful! Check. It's Saint Amant versus Staunton! I don’t understand... I don’t understand. Oh, yes you do. Oh, yes you do. You understand damn well! That is Saint Amant versus Staunton! I knew it fifteen moves ago and I couldn't focus on it. This match was played in Paris, on December 6th, 1843... It's a classic game. You led me into it! You've played before. You know every game! Not every game. Well, you certainly know this game well enough! You let me win. You should have played bishop takes rooks pawn, and I would have had to resign! Where have you played before? I never played, I've only read books. I don't play! I've only read books! You let me win! She let me win! Nobody ever let me win! Let me out of here! Nobody! You had him beaten. A move already made. - I believe that he... - Shhh... I believe that even if I had taken his rook's pawn he could have replied with a move that could have been a draw. Enough, Victoria. Why did you wish me to lose? Because you should have lost. But chess is only a game. Once we lose all the possibilities of play, there's a logical progression to the conclusion. There are some things you can't get out of books. To understand them... They have to be experienced. be patient. - Victoria. - What a wonderful thing to see. His ego will never recover! Welcome to our little group! We're original but very loving. You'll like us! I know I will. Paul. I want to learn... To experience. Will you teach me? Put you into a clinic. An exhibit. A freak. February 24. 7:00 am. Administering 50cc of Methotrexate... A risk, because it is a very strong drug... and highly addictive. If Methotrexate doesn't arrest the rapid aging. I have no choice but to transfer the girl to the research clinic. Where is California's answer to Madam Curie, this morning? Martha, you go through life as if you were constantly sucking on a lemon. Well, then I won't have to learn to sip nectar in the future. Two impressive degrees, and she's how old, Twenty-five? Brilliant, obviously. Let's see, Nicole was 30 before she got hers, wasn't she? Martha, this is your home. You belong here. and now Victoria belongs here. It's a whole new life for all of us. Why not become a part of it? The greatest revelation is stillness. Laudissé, 12th century? I don't know one person in a thousand would know the author of that! And I don't know anyone who's ever quoted it. Could be that we're perfectly matched. Perhaps. Do you really control this entire operation? Yes, I do. My computers are better company than most people I know. They're impersonal, but intellectually stimulating. This is it. The best in the States. Maybe in the world. And here's the medical unit you asked about. Can I ask it a question? Do you know how to operate a computer? -Yes. - Of course, you read a book about it. Like chess. Yes, I did. Now type out the pertinent background data here, and then the question. More. Thank you. Antidote: 70 ml of pituitary gland extract from unborn foetus, five to six months developed. Is the question as enigmatic as the answer? Thank you very much, Mr. Collier. Goodbye. A six month foetus has a chance for life on its own. To experiment, to fail at that stage would be murder. Can you swing me? Can you swing me? Okay. I can go higher than you can. Faster, faster! Faster, faster! Your bouillabaisse is the best, Martha. Couldn't top it in one of the finest restaurants in Marseille. Thank you. Nice to be appreciated. In the cookbook la gustacion Le recommends a touch more tarragon. I'll get the coffee. When is your baby due? According to my calculations, I am... five months, twenty-five days and about two hours pregnant. maybe due August 7th. August 5th. Paul mentioned that you and Gordon are going out of town next week. To Seattle, Gordon is seeding the bushes again for university money. I'm going to tag along with him. If Dr. Kindland will let me. He's a terrific gynecologist, but he has zero sense of adventure. He thinks that planes and pregnant ladies don't mix. Dr. Kindland? Yes, I understand he's very good. No, it is not my imagination. You took it the wrong way, Martha. What's the matter with you? I don't know what's the matter with me. I didn't take anything the wrong way. I can't stand to be in the same room with that woman. - Why? - She frightens me, Paul. It's not... I don't see why. For heaven's sake she's been nothing but nice to you. You've chosen not to be nice to her. I have checked, Paul. Your precious Victoria isn't any research assistant.
