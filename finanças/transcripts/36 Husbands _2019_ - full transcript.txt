It's my place actually. I prepared this entire exhibition. Thank you for the invitation. Excuse me, I... I really love this sculpture. I'm sorry, I think I know this woman. I wondered... If I found my way to a quiet little room... Away from the noisy crowd... Would he follow me? How did the experiment go? I'll tell you when it's over. Are you comfortable, my darling? I'm in heaven. Are you sure this is the right address? 66 Ruling Class Lane. Are you here for the concert? We're Bright Blue Gorilla. We love you guys! Where do we set up?

Gaze upon the past and you gaze upon the future. I can see myself in this plate! And this glass. And the silver. You've discovered some way to make dishes shine. After the commercial. Can it be stopped? It's the effect of a cause: Greed and selfishness. Can it be slowed? It has to happen. Slowed until wisdom takes hold? You will be summoned to that task. Maxwell House coffee tastes as good as it smells, every time. Let's take a break. That's the new girl. What is the essence of this training? To avoid and disable, to move undetected, to be informed through intuition. You have Albinism. Yes I do. It's difficult to hold my eyes and head still, and sunlight burns me. Other than that, I'm amazing. Where is the intuition? Just beyond the mind, in the Real Self. And how do you reach the Real Self? Through deep meditation. You answer well. Gina... Have them tune-in for a while. Let's focus everybody. I'll be back tomorrow night. That was quick. Triplets. Sons of a missionary in Beijing. Their only regret is that they're not Asian. Criminals actually. They call their gang "Sen Sen". Catchy isn't it? Are you enjoying yourself? Always. That's a nice technique. Are they dead? They'll wake up in half an hour. That gives us time to chat. How long has it been? Not long enough. You're still mad about that? How's the shoulder? What do you want? World War 3 is here. But it's early yet so most people haven't noticed. Cyber attacks, updated weapons systems, political puppets in place, it's all prologue. The show is on. What's your point? I want you to form a new agency, strictly off the books. Sabotage, confuse, throw their plans off. Americans are worthless at the moment and... British spies are only good in the movies. Give us time to know who to trust. I need time. You can get it for me. That technique is impressive. But don't get over confident... You and this... It's all so perfect. How did you know meatloaf was my favorite? I just had a feeling. I'm so sorry about last night. You were tired. I don't even remember going to bed. You've got good reflexes! I used to play tennis. I'll make it up to you. I promise. I know you will. Not very romantic toasting with water, but after last night... It's perfect. To us. The meatloaf is getting cold. Silly me! Going on and on... when you've been slaving over a hot stove all day. There's something in this. Something wonderful! What spice is that? Family secret! Nice clips. It's in his profile. The guards work the floors in 9 minute intervals. There's only one camera we need to worry about... just behind the door. What took so long? I couldn't get him out. I had to use gas. We have to work on that. Are you sure this is right? There's nothing here. That's why I 'm sure. 3, 2, 1. What does it mean? We're either too early or too late. You'd better get back to your husband... before he wakes up. We have to try again tomorrow. When they find the guard they'll lock down the place. Knock out a skinny guy next time. They'll be here in two minutes. Poor guy. He'll wake up in the tropics. Not so bad. He'll get fired. He'll find another job. I put $100 in his pocket. I hope they pick him up before he's mugged. Robyn, sweetheart! Have I got a gig for you! We got a gig! Hope it's not in hell this time. Quick question: Could you play guitar wearing a contamination suit? Probably, if the gloves are thin.

It's forgotten. You are divine! I know I told you I wanted to come here... even though I said I can't dance. Maybe we should head home... About the dancing. About not being able to dance... I want you to know... What? I lied! I won a national dance contest a few years ago! What happened? He won a dance contest. I'll explain later. Now the missile will detonate on the launch pad. Exactly. Nothing personal. We can't leave him. How many guards do they need? Hey man, are you all right? Hey, Karate Kid. We've got to work on your skills. I know. Grab a foot. Three guards disappearing in two days. They'll know something happened but they won't know what. Bon voyage. Hello, Mama! Are you okay? I'm going to the drugstore. I'll be right back. Be green, be green, be green... No, no, no! Thank you, thank you! Prepare. When you're ready, put Gina out. She won't resist. Sorry. Reflexes. Again. That didn't work. It did hurt though. It's not force, it's intention. Stop thinking of yourself as a body. You are consciousness and energy, residing in a body. Watch. No force at all. Wow. That was like an electric shock. It was. The body is filled with energy. If you go deep enough you'll learn how to move it. Meditate more. One minute to broadcast. Now I've got a headache. ♪ What comes next?

These are yours. Wow. He owns a sheep station. He's, like, 70. 52 and you fit his profile. That's a hard 52. What do we want with him? Just read the file. I've seen him before. Yes you have. He's with MI6. On loan to us. Doesn't fight well but he's fairly smart. He thinks he's James Bond. Don't they all? Please read the files. There's a lot to memorize and we leave in 4 hours. Okay guys, I need you in 10 minutes. Okay. Does this make any sense to you? Page 10. Yeah, I don't get it. We've got to talk to the writers. They're getting weirder and weirder.

Carburetor. Fuel filter. Not good to be out here in the wild. Australia has over 30 types of venomous spiders and snakes. How far to the telescope? About half an hour. I think you're right. It's the carburetor. Maybe it'll clear. Or maybe not. I think the fuel line has a crack. Do you see any gas dripping? Lots of oil but no gas. Oil pan gasket needs replacing. How's the fuel line look? It's got a hairline crack. There's a slow drip by the fuel tank. See if you can tape it up. Hand me the screwdriver. Not the Philips, the slot. Maybe we should move the car... away from these bushes. There could be anything crawling around out here. Uh huh. We'll do that. Snake! Snake! It's not poisonous. Well it looked poisonous. Make yourself useful and turn the ignition. Don't start it until I tell you. You guys clear down there? Clear. Go ahead! Be sure to get it all. Dirty motor oil is highly carcinogenic. Thanks for the tip. I hope you didn't swallow any. That could lead to mutating stomach tissue. It's a fact. They studied the effect of several grades of... dirty engine oil on laboratory rats... and they all developed terminal lymph... Just stand here and don't say anything. It's not so bad. Your car... Don't. I love your car. And I look pathetic. The ranch is 2 kilometers north by northwest. If you don't make contact or if there's any trouble just signal. Otherwise we rendezvous as planned. Okay. Finishing touch. Nice one. And practical. Australian sun can cause all types of... "Once more unto the breach, dear friends." I've got everything. We'll stash it on the way. Are you ready to earn your keep? Yes, ma'am, I am. Why suffer? Just tell us. Tell us what you know. And we'll let you go. I don't know. I don't know. Shall I push the button again? No! Please! No more! I beg you! Save yourself. Tell us what you know. I told you, I don't know anything. And I... don't believe you! Catchy, isn't it? Hi there! Sorry to bother you. I'm a little lost. It's a type of star that pulses... brighter, dimmer, over days or weeks. Discovered over 100 years ago by Henrietta Leavitt. She must have been extraordinary. And determined. How many astronomers use your telescope? About 400 each year, representing about 20 countries. Fascinating. Well the interesting thing is... We think it's unit 2. Over. I'm on my way. Over. Copy that. Tell us what you find. Control, I'm at Unit 2. I see some loose cables but it's hard to tell from down here. I'll climb up after lunch and have a look then. Over. Copy that. Bon appetite. That's where I left it! We have a reciprocal access policy with several nations. Hey, look at this. Canberra just sent a pulse to one of our satellites. It's encrypted. It can't be right. Wait. It just stopped. Should we report? No. It's a glitch. Canberra doesn't encrypt. It's not a question of "if", it's a question of degree. Quite impressive. Amazing place. Glad to hear that. The professor's invited us to a get-together... he's having Thursday evening. Very kind of you. A little gathering at my vineyard. Scientists, diplomats, and other questionable characters. "And on the 7th day he took her shopping." I'll take you if you take me. Come as you are. In this? Not a chance. I look forward to seeing you there. I wouldn't miss it. Wonderful. Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a technical matter that needs my attention. Of course. See you Thursday! Everything good? Perfect. Back to town then? I'll catch up with you later. There's someone I want to see. Ah! There it is. Please. No more. My feet hurt. What kind of agent are you? This is where the training kicks in. I was trained to think for myself. I'm sitting this one out. Okay then. Mama will bring you an ice cream. Take your time, mama. Doing a little shopping are we, darling? Sorry. I'm taking up all the room. Nice perfume you're wearing. It's this one, one of the boxes. Pretty strong. You may be pretty... but I wouldn't call you strong. Hey! Come on. He just wants to have a look. There's no harm in that, is there, darling? It's a little gaudy, isn't it? You should stick with earth tones. I hope your hands are clean. Oh. Is this yours? We thought it was your girlfriends. Put it back in the box. That sounds like an order. Does that sound like an order to you, mate? It sure did. You'd better do what she says. Now what is wrong with this picture? Can anybody tell me? These two ladies are trying to give us orders. That's what's wrong. Oops. Do you know what a pressure point is? Oh! And she's a smart one. Imagine that. It controls the flow of energy in the body. What? Like this? No. Like this. Interesting isn't it? Nice, don't you think? Very. Nice. I thought so too. Come on, Frankie. Ice cream time. So long, gents. No hard feelings. Over days or weeks... Fascinating. The interesting thing is... when you put all those minds in one place... Ah, there's professor Barnhardt. Will you excuse me for a moment? Of course. Lovely evening, isn't it? Perfect weather. Keep your eyes open. There's enough agents around here... to hold a convention. Keep your eye on her. The blonde? CIA's watching. Kiss me. What? CIA. Kiss me, quick. That's a kiss? You said quick. Are they... They are still there. I think they're gone. Oh. Good. Looks like the fireworks are starting early! And where has that charming companion of yours gone off to? Powder room. Ah yes, of course. Will you excuse me? She's still not back? Oh... She was here... uh... she went... She went to get a drink. Ah! I'll join her. Something's wrong. What'll we do? Here comes the professor. She's not at the bar. I wonder where's she's gone off to? This is a magnificent property. I was just about to form a search party. The moon is enormous. You can see it so clearly up on the ridge. Low on the horizon tonight. Shall we go have another look? Pleasant evening, isn't it? Perfect. Do you? I do. Comrade, do we have to go on? Tell us what you know. Help us and we'll help you. You may break my body. But you'll never break my spirit. I'll never join you. Never, never, never! Never. Good morning! Yes. Did you have a good night? I hate sheep. And last night was... strange. No. Weird. It was weird. Are you all right? I made contact. I told him I used to work on a sheep station... so he put me to work. A lot of work. I worked in the shearing shed. Try to avoid doing that if you can. Sweaty macho men and sheep under stress. Sheep have tremendous gas... especially when they're under stress. Most people don't know that. Anyway, I worked and worked and... You know, I hate sheep. Did I mention that? I really hate them. I hate the way they smell and their greasy wool... and their lice. Did you know sheep have lice? The little monsters are crawling with them. Anyway... I worked and worked and the first night... I just collapsed on the bed. I was dead. But the next day... I sort of got the hang of it and... I actually had the energy to have dinner with the grazier. That's when it got weird. No, no. It wasn't weird bad. It was just... Weird. He made this fantastic meal on an open campfire. Cooking on a campfire? That is not easy. But it was the best dinner I've ever eaten. So... He starts to serenade me on guitar. It was the most lovely, moving... romantic thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he said he had a stiff neck... and I think, this is perfect. I'll rub his neck and knock him out... and get the book and take off. But... I realized... I had sort of fallen for this guy. Maybe it was just exhaustion... but I wanted to feel his strong arms around me. I wanted to bask in that experienced... romantic, sensitive amalgamation of everything that was manly. So anyway, I'm rubbing his shoulders... and I lean over to kiss him... Maybe it was past his bedtime. Geriatrics often need extra sleep... to help with brain function. Anyway... I let him sleep and I found his brother's diary... and photographed it. The last entry, 2 days before he died... had a sketch of the schematic we're looking for.

It's Sen Sen we're talking about. You know what they're capable of. It's not worth the risk. Gina, you said he was a sweet guy. You're going to leave him? It's a dirty job but we all signed on. Howard didn't sign on. Look, I liked him, but... Do you have any idea what he may be going through right now? God, this is amazing! Our mother owned a restaurant. Have some more tofu.

He gets fainting spells. Low blood sugar. You wouldn't happen to have a glucose tablet would you? We have coffee creamer. And donuts. That might be good. It's catching. They're twins. It runs in the family. We're on in two. What happened to them? Low blood sugar. Get a medic, would you? Okay, but hurry up! Live TV waits for no one! Hey! Found them! Is it me or is that weird? It's weird. The medic will take care of them. Let's go. Okay kids... This is a fantasy sequence, we're inside of Michael's head. Not a particularly great place to be but here we are. I don't think that's funny. Shh! So I want you all up and dancing... having the time of your lives... happy happy happy! And this is live television... so no matter what happens, keep on dancing. Okay? We're on in five... four... Doctor and guards are knocked out backstage. Sen Sen is over there doing the "Mashed Potato". Frankie, you get the earrings. You both come with me. I know your tricks! 100% Malaysian rubber! Non-conductive! Go ahead and try. You can't knock me out! Very clever. Dancing! You're dancing! This isn't a Bruce Lee movie! He's a good fighter. You. How do I look? Nice, huh? Frankie, what are you doing? I have the... Hey! I'll get him. He's a better fighter. Wait for me! You! Krista! That is very violent. Hey. Howard. Run. What? Run. We should run. Old school. I just felt that in order to fulfill my duties... I had to make certain choices. That's an excellent point, and a positive one. I feel good about that. Knowing you understand means a lot to me. It's very validating. Now, Howard, how does that make you feel? Well... I felt abandoned, and... Nobody abandoned... Gina. This is Howard's moment. Sorry. Thank you, Frankie. I felt worthless... Like a plastic bottle thrown into the recycle bin. That's perfectly valid. Although, to be accurate... recycled bottles do have some value. Thank you, Frankie, for that positive note. Gina, how does that make you feel? Well, I... Sorry to interrupt, keep going with your counseling... but I've got a splitting headache and... I'm taking a nap. You have your meeting. I know. Thanks. I'm going to lay down. Violence doesn't pay. Now, Gina, you were talking about your feelings. Yes, my intention wasn't to abandon anybody... Let her have it! For a job that never ends. It's like cleaning house. As soon as you've done it, it's time to start cleaning again. But you put on a good show. So good that we get a sequel. Sequel? Sequel. Franchise. Money. Lots of money. But there's one little change. Just one. Girls. Meet your replacements. No! What is it?
