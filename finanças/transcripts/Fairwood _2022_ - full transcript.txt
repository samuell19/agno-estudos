Previously on "fair wood." You're number one throughout the nine-county area. The world wants to know, where are the sweethearts of country music? Candy and honey are hiding out in east plains, right? Don't tell anybody. This is a gold mine. It is everything you'd hoped for. An endless supply of cheap, green energy. Just like the one under channel 29. Just get me that station. I won't let you down. There you are... Uh... oh, my... You've got to be kidding me! The fair wood ratings are solid. Those boys are a breath of fresh air. Cheese puff? I don't trust orange food. We gotta keep moving the ratings up! We'll get there. Up, up, up. You seem filled with the spirit. I am. I truly am. I really love it when the numbers go up. Have you met spooner mcneill? He's a decorated Iraq veteran. Y'know, he went after those al qaedas. He's the one that found that tall fella with the long beard. You're the lady from the American legion. - Have you two met? - No. You must have me confused with someone else. We should talk about the wind... and soon. And we will. Oh, gosh, is it 2:00 already? We have to jump on a conference call. We don't really have a conference call, do we? No, but I hate idle chit-chat. Ms. Constantinople-valdez? Hello, Mr. Rusty. I love you on "spin the wheel." Oh, thank you. I wrote you a poem. When I watch you spin, it makes my heart begin. Oh! Disgusting are the bugs! Well, I guess if you have to drop out of sight for a while, this is a pretty good place to do it. You know it's driving the paparazzi nuts. Who writes this stuff? Mama, there's something I need to talk to you about. Mmm, this lemonade is good. I made it myself. Tweaked grammy's recipe... No dirt. Mama, seriously, can you just focus for a second, please? Mama, because of you all our dreams came true, and I wouldn't trade any of it. But I don't need a business partner right now. I need a mother. We've got commitments, and with this pregnancy we've gotta be careful about what happens. I don't care what happens. I don't care if everyone demands I act like a sweetheart and if they all wanna just talk crap about me, I don't care, because that's not who I am anymore. But you have a responsibility to to myself. What about us? Inspired service! Yes, it was. Yes. Yeah, you all have a lovely Sunday. Now, you boys are on TV now. You got a responsibility to see the injustice in this world with a clear eye and do something about it. - Amen. - You hear me? - Yes, sir. - Do you hear me? - I hear you. - Use the love in your heart to inspire those who walk - through this world gracelessly. - Amen. Man up. - You hear me? - I hear you. - You hear me? - I do. Thank you, Jesus. Come in. Miss constantinople-valdez? I just wanted to wish you luck before you spin that wheel, and to give you these flowers as a token of my deep appreciation of... you. Beautiful are the flowers, but I must not be accepting them. They're tulips. I am reliably informed that all beautiful women are fond of spring blooming perennial herbaceous bulbiferous geophytes. Allergic. To the tulips! I am. Well, that could have gone better. Make it quick. I'm up to my pantylines in here. We have located the source, and we have a plan to harness it. Exactly how powerful is this wind source? It is more powerful than we ever expected. What now? This. So we demolish the station, take over most of the town, and put about half the population out of work. Correct. Some might call this extreme. It is the only way to harness billions of dollars worth of natural energy. I said some might call this extreme. Can I help you gentlemen? - Uh... we were just... - No. This is a private conversation. What is "unobtanium"? I've got your number, yoko. I see you, because I used to be you. And the most dangerous thing you can do at this point in your little life is to try and outsmart someone who used to be you... But is now me. Coco, earlier, we overheard something quite intriguing. I suspect we may be expecting some unexpected occurrences. I expect you're right. Channel 29: Serving the nine-county area. How may I direct your call? Yes, sir. Oh! Channel 29: Serving the nine-county area. How may I direct your call? - Says here that Mrs. - Johnson was blown like a tumbleweed down elkhoof Avenue. Seems like there's more than meets the eye - about this wind business. - Like what? I suspect these pentalode folks could already be thinkin' just what we're thinkin'. What are we thinkin'? Well, they are an energy company. And Valerie Stanton may be a few sandwiches shy of a picnic, you know what I mean? I don't. She's a pretty smart cookie. Oh, right, right. So let's do a little diggin'. And we are back with chef cherabusc... - Cherrie... mm-hmm. - Cherobusco. And we have another beautiful cocktail! This is perfect for a small gathering at home or a holiday party. Or perhaps just sitting around in your so us-vÃªtements. Mmm, delicious. But you must be precise in your measurements. Now I am an experienced mixologist. - And we'll... - We'll be right back after these "commesial sursages". There... careful... whoa. Hi and hello. May I have a word with you? Just. You. Mm-hmm. There's been an unusual amount of... Go ogling in this office over the past few days. How do you know that? Because I'm spying on everyone. Illegal. Unethical. But I like it. So why do we care about employees playing on the Internet? Because they're not playing. They're digging deep into pentalode and into you. Could be anyone in the building. - Farnsworth? - I don't know. But they're getting close. Whatever. - Bo, you don't know. - Whatcha readin', Clark? - The Kowalski brothers! - They're trashin' us! Jealousy is a sickness. Well, I hope they get well soon. Come on, we got a show to do. Share my burden. - Looky there, Clark. - It's a little outhouse. I always wanted to go in one of those. - Who's that? - Looks like he's going bowling. Hmm. That's kind of weird. Who's he looking for? Clark, I think there's more to this than meets the eye. This is cool! Whoa! What happened to you guys? Why you all disheveled? There's some mighty strange meteorology goin' on down there. Very breezy. I don't know what's going on around here, but I'm sure gonna find out. You are going to work your little fingers to the bone on unobtanium, cap ice? Grill the staff and find out what they know about what's under the station. You mean talk to them face to face? In person? Unless you can do it telepathically. Telepathy has yet to be proven. Dr. Brown? Coco, is it? Yes, coco. You are the new hr guy, right? And you're from pentalode? I think I should be asking the questions. Now that pentalode and channel 29 have joined forces, we would like to know if any of the recent changes here at the station are affecting your productivity. There's a hole in the parking lot and someone built a shed on it. But other than that, everything's great! Do you know what that thing is? Are they working on power lines or... They are! Working on the power lines. Have you noticed any unusual wind outside? - Sorry, I'm confused. - Valerie said this was a meeting was about a benefits package? It is. Does it not seem like that is what this is about? What is your history with channel 29? I was in France. Now I'm here. Do you have a scientific background? - Oui. - Please expand on that. I am a mixologist. You have been with channel 29 for ten years, is this correct? Yes. I'm sort of the Savannah Guthrie of the place. Or the Craig Melvin. He's my favorite. Have you noticed any unusual wind emissions in or around the office? Finally, someone brings this up. I'm very sensitive to this kind of thing. You had a reaction? I'm not the only one. Could you pinpoint the direction of the wind, and/or the source of the emission? It came from Sharon in accounting. - Can you sign a few things? - Dr. Brown does not seem to know too much about human resources. I'm sure the guy's a pro. Valerie hand-picked him. I wouldn't worry. What's the deal with the shed in the parking lot? They're working on the water main. Dr. Brown said they're working on the power lines. Then they're working on the power lines. Is that something human resources would know about? You're pretty inquisitive. - Sorry. - No, no, no, don't be. I like a curious mind. Which is a more than I can say for Valerie, if you catch my drift. Got it. - What are you doing? - We have a meeting at 9:00. You hungry? I never eat solid foods during business hours. Hunger sharpens and focuses the predatory instinct. So... What's going on with the shed in the parking lot? They're inspecting the sewer lines. Who is? The chief engineer of the metropolitan department of why don't you mind your own business? Come on, we're late. And wear that green shirt I like. Oh, god, this has gotta be worse then the tulips. Clark, I've never been so inspired in my life. Ya know, varma really squeezes my musical juice. I heard love'll do that to you. This song came to me in a dream. Maybe yours, too. Vitamin b? Powdered black rhinoceros horn. Increases electrical activity in the brain .8%. $1600 an ounce. I thought the black rhinoceros was endangered. It is. Don't worry, I've got a five year supply stockpiled. I talked to your people. No one knows anything. I'm worried about the it guy. I'd like to get rid of him, but he's Farnsworth's mascot. He's brilliant, you know. He may come in handy. I don't like men who are good with numbers. Ahh! Channel 29!
