The court reached a verdict. NEW SERIES What are you doing to my car? What are you doing? THIS IS HOW WE WERE RAISED What have we done, man? But we didn't do anything, man. He just up and died in front of us. I guess it was his time. But... Why did we put him in the trunk? Why did we bring him here? Say something, man. We're screwed, Müjdat. We're screwed. Damn it, Ayhan. This is all because of you. God damn you, Ayhan. Damn it, Ayhan. Damn it, Ayhan. Damn it! You're the best, Garfish. I swear you're the best. Kudos. I'm off, dude. KAYHAN REAL ESTATE We keep staring at the dead guy. What are we going to do? I have an idea. Let's not move him. Let's just drive the car off a cliff. What do you think? Let's bury him in the yard. Sure. Let's do that, man. Sure. Let's light candles for him too. And a shrine so people can present offerings. The Body Shop Shrine. For God's sake... I'm just saying it'd be easier, man. - Easier than what you're proposing. - Just shut up and let me think. All right. I'll shut up. If I were to talk, though, I'd say I had an idea. - But I won't talk because you'll get mad. - I'll get mad if it's stupid. All right. I'll shut up. - Do you want to hear it? - Just spit it out, man. We could use turpentine. Maybe he'll dissolve in the barrel. And he won't stink. Turpentine? How many years of experience do we have with turpentine, Müjdat? Especially you. Has it dissolved us at all? All right. As I said, I'll shut up. I swear... The entire world's up and working already. but those two are still asleep. They're dragging this country down. Open up, you two! - Stop yelling, asshole. - But you wouldn't open up. Just pick up the pace, Müjdat. We have to work. We have a lot to do, but you two are just fooling around. Why is this car here? Why did you bring it here? Can't you do anything right? Why the fuck is it here, Yılmaz? Listen, Ayhan. I fell in love with it. Look at her. Such a beauty. Our fathers had one of these too. I felt a connection, so I brought it here. God bless you, brother. Let me give you a hug. Sure, but we could've gotten another one. Why did you two bring this one... Hey! Stop! - What did I do to deserve you? - Stop, man. - I'm going to kill you. - The bastard's going blue, man. I swear I'm going to kill him. All this bullshit over a parking spot! He's dying. This one's dying too, man! Right. - What the hell, man? - Do you want to know? What did this car ever do to you? You know the answer. He was giving us a hard time. How was he doing that? He kept parking it in front of the shop. What office? You call that real estate office a shop? It's not like you get deliveries. For God's sake, the guy's insane. You know he is. He just wouldn't move it. We were all scared Kayhan would hurt him. You said you'd do anything for Kayhan when I asked you. Didn't he? Didn't you? I did, damn it! Don't tell me what I already know. Shut up, man. Don't push him. All right. Fine. Okay. Listen, guys. You were supposed to move it two blocks over, but it's here. What was your reasoning at the time? He's talking like a reporter again. "What was your reasoning at the time?" I don't get it because you're not telling me. I'm trying to understand, aren't I? Stop yelling! Shut up, asshole! Didn't I tell you not to yell just a moment ago, you asshole? All right. I don't get it, man. All right. Fine, Ayhan. I'll explain. Shit! Mr. Vamık? Mr. Vamık's lying in here, guys. Yeah, he is. You can take him to his bed if you don't want to get him cold. The guy's dead, man. Oh no! - Where are you going, Ayhan? - I'm not going anywhere, man! What did you two do? Is this what I asked for? I just asked you to move the car. I just wanted him to think it was stolen. You two killed him and put him in a barrel. Why? To turn him into fuel or something? This is an atrocity! What the hell? What did we do? Is the bastard calling us murderers? Am I wrong? Is this what I asked for? What is this? The poor guy's off to the other side soaked in turpentine! Why would you kill him, you weirdo? We were trying to do what you asked. He just jumped in front of us and collapsed. - That's all. - I think he had a heart attack. I think it was colon cancer, Müjdat. It's just at he died so suddenly... All right! Fine. But why did you bring him here, Yılmaz? The car too. Why didn't you call 911 and leave him? We had put him in the car so we could take him to the hospital, but he went ice-cold. We checked him and stuff. It was ridiculous. We were confused, so we came here. Then you fucking started knocking. He had an idea, so we put him in the barrel. That's how it went. - What are we going to do now? - I don't know. Let's open the shop. Everyone knows we live here. We shouldn't act suspicious. We'll figure something out tonight. He's like a stopped clock sometimes. He's right twice a day. - He's right, isn't he? - But what about the car, Yılmaz? Right. I forgot. Right. What's the plan? Hear me out. We'll open the shop a bit late. No one will get suspicious. Don't worry. Get the gear. - The... - Go. Put on your favorite song on full blast as well. A song? What? We're tearing it down. - Hey, Müjdat. - Yeah? - Open the shop. - Sure. I should go. Is the stuff ready? I need samples. - You need samples? - Yeah. Come. Come on. Follow me. TO-DO LIST CREDIT CARD LAST DAY - AUGUST 3RD This is all because of you. Here are your cans of sin. For God's sake... What does it have to do with me? Tell me what our current issue has to do with home-made diesel. It has everything to do with it, asshole. Didn't you get us involved in this? You said we'd all be rich. - "Mix burnt oil and turpentine..." - Was I lying? - You spent the money at clubs. - There's a dead guy in there. - A dead guy! - But... Hey! - Müjdat? - You told me to open. But I didn't tell you to let any scumbag in. The boss sent me. We're not selling the place. This is the only lot left. The boss told me to handle it. I'm just a servant. One should only be God's servant. - The boss won't let it go. Just saying. - Off you go now. Come on. Fuckface. - I'm leaving too. - You know the way. You're too tense, man. - What are you doing here, Ayhan? - What the hell? All right. Let's calm down. What are you doing here? Kayhan gave me permission. We're just driving around with Ms. Meral. But the stereo just died on us, so I thought Yılmaz could check. All right. You do that. Don't be late, though. - Take care, my man. - See you. The stereo died. - Welcome. - Hello. I know it's not your field, but you told me you'd help with anything. So I brought it to you, sir. Sure, Aynur. You're our neighbor. Of course you can come to me. Don't be fooled by our looks. We're actually car surgeons, but we like touching cars up more. You certainly don't need touching up, though. - Well, shall we offer our guests some tea? - Right away. Don't bother. We have a few errands to run anyway. - We'll be back. - Our tea is amazing. Look. My recipe is the best. Don't think it's just tea. I add a little cinnamon, a dash of cloves, and a bit of ginger sometimes. Sounds nice. I'd like to try it one day. Whenever you want to try. I'm always here. I mean, we're here. You're new in our neighborhood, after all. So whatever you need, we're always here. We'll take our leave, then. We'll be back soon anyway. - Sure. - I'll get my bag. - We'll be back. - Whenever you want. All right. See you, then. All right. We'll let you know. Sure. We'll be back anyway. - All right. Right? - Right. Take care. Where are my keys? She's so into you, man. I'm telling you. Is that why she called me sir? That's just because you're Ayhan's friend. Fuck Ayhan, man. Just be like, "Don't call me that." Try and see. And then I'll go, "Just call me 'bro.'" Right? What do you think, Mr. Expert? Also, cinnamon and cloves? I saw it on a daytime show. Women love it, man. It's not like you tried it, jackass. We'll try it out, man. What's the big deal? It's just ginger. - I'll check the stereo. - Okay. She's something else, man. I hope what we're doing is all right, guys. With the dead guy there and you two here. - What do you think? - Excellent. What do we owe you, sir? Nothing, of course. - That won't do. Please. - It'll do. Thank you. - Come on now. Don't be late. - All right. What the hell are you doing? It's good luck, man. I'm sending her off. Yeah, right. Just do your job, man. - Is the paint ready? - It is. Nice. You go have some dinner. Good afternoon. What's up? What the... Mr. Vamık? - How did it go? - How did what go? What do you mean? What do you mean? What do you think, man? With Mr. Vamık. Mr. Vamık... Let me guess, Müjdat. You've been sniffing turpentine again. - I had meatballs. - Good. - Join me. - Dude! - Dude! - Dude! - Müjdat, where's Yılmaz? - Where is he? - Where is he? - He's napping. - He naps a lot. - He does. - We should wake him. - We should. - Who will? - Who should? - Should you or I? - Should I or you? - One of us has to do it. - Has to. Fuck, Müjdat. This conversation is going nowhere. It really isn't. - What should we do? - What should we? - Let's wake him together. - Let's. - Come on, then. - Let's go. Come on. Let's go. - See, when we listen to each other... - Exactly. Come on. Go wake him up. I don't want to. What is this, Müjdat? You're seeing it too? I am. Wait a minute. - It's not real. - It is. - It's real. - It is. - It rocks. - It does. - Hey, Yılmaz. - Yılmaz! Yılmaz! - What the hell? - Yılmaz! - Get up! - What the hell is it? - Dude, the car rocks. - How did you pull it off, Yılmaz? It just rocks. Guys... are you seeing what I'm seeing? Just wow, Yılmaz. Hey, Müjdat. Did you add something in the paint when you prepared it? No, man. Just the usual mix. I took the turpentine from the barrel. I did pray for him when I took it, though. - I did, so maybe... - What are you talking about? Get me a door from there. A bumper and a hood too. There was some paint left. We'll see. Did Vamık's ghost affect the paint? Should we be scared? You should be scared, Ayhan. This is all because of you anyway. You brought this here too. What is the owner going to say? He'll be over the moon, man. I'll talk to him. Relax. It's impossible to relax when you're involved, Ayhan. We're so lucky, man. We had already primed it. The door was waiting to be painted. Get the spray gun ready. - Make way. - Sure. Relax. I'll talk to the owner. Cover your mouths. It doesn't rock, man. It's back to normal. - This is what it normally looks like. - Yeah? Listen. Think carefully, all right? You're going to do the exact same thing. Follow your exact steps. You understand? Listen, Müjdat. Don't forget to pray and... Ayhan. - But he did pray. Just do it, okay? - All right. Do it. Listen, Yılmaz. If we figure this out, we'll be filthy rich. If you mention money again, I'm going to kick your ass. All right. I'll shut up. It didn't work. You prayed, right? Did you do it exactly the same? I don't make mistakes, man. Guys. Listen to me very carefully now, okay? We're going to bury Mr. Vamık tonight. Then we're going to pray for forgiveness for the rest of our lives. I doubt we'll be forgiven. And after we're done, we won't speak of it ever again. Got it? God bless his soul. May no harm come to him. May he rest in peace. Amen, brother. - The dead is just fine, Müjdat. - Right. The survivors suffer more. It's the mortal realm that's tough. You're right. We all live and die anyway, brother. You know the saying. There's good death, and there's bad death. Kayhan always says the world is a ruse anyway. - He's right. - You have to prepare for what comes after. Because we don't know what's going to happen in five minutes. True. What we do here doesn't matter. What we leave behind is what counts. Am I right? But I feel okay, brother. Do you want to know why? - The poor guy was in peace at least. - Exactly. - I mean, he didn't suffer. - Exactly. - I mean, was this good for him? - Exactly. - It was. He just died peacefully. - Yeah. Exactly. May God take him in his Heaven. Amen, man. You know the saying. Which saying? Which saying? You said, "You know the saying." Did I now? You did, man. You were like... What's wrong? Come on. Get out. You heard him. - Were you able to recall the saying? - Not now, man. - Do you guys have a lighter? - I don't smoke. I don't have one. I see. Get out of the car, you two. Come on. We just committed the biggest sin, and you two are talking about faith like you're on TV, man. Just get out. I don't want to see you two tonight. Don't come by the shop either. I swear I'll kill you if you do. Do you think it's normal for you to get so mad, Yılmaz? Kicking us out in the middle of the night... You should get that checked, man. You're harming yourself. I mean... Get out! It's late, man. Don't leave him by himself. You too, Müjdat. You too. Me too? He has a temper, man. He sure does. He just gets so mad all of a sudden. Is that normal? He should have his blood sugar checked. He kicked me out of my own car. I seriously don't get it, man. Seriously, man. It's my car. Why did I have to get out? It indeed was your car. Yeah. I thought it was yours at the time. Nothing's normal right now, man. It's tough on all of us. Once we put this behind us, we'll turn over a new leaf. It's not a big deal, man. Mr. Vamık had no one anyway. No need to worry about that. It just sucks that he's dead is all. - Right. - It caused trouble for all of us. Damn right. Listen, man. It wasn't worth dying over anyway. Mr. Vamık should've just stayed alive. We were just moving his car. It's not bad for him alone. He's gone, but we had to deal with it. - Exactly. - He did wrong. But he did give us an opportunity. If we can mix that paint again, we'll be filthy rich, Müjdat. But that's over, man. You heard Yılmaz. He told us to drop it. We buried Mr. Vamık anyway. His effect on the paint is lost too. I disagree. I'm going to see what I can do. - Should we get beer? - Sure. As a symbolic gesture. You're so gorgeous. You're tearing me apart, girl. And your... Your world is so pure that when I see you, when I look at you... I feel like crying. I've never even cried before. I'm serious. And when you say my name and call me sir, you know, my heart just skips a beat. It makes me feel funny. I guess that's my curse. That's right. And what did I do? I wanted to get my act together. I wanted you to see me as a gentleman. But what happened? It all went to shit. Hey, Aynur. Hey, Aynur. Of course, man. He put up with a lot of our shenanigans. He's been like a father to us. He's always helped us when we needed him. Exactly. I was ten years old, man. He's been looking out for me since the orphanage. When I was ten, he found me and said, "There are people like us." He brought me here to our fathers. If I have a profession now... I've never left his side, man. Right. We all know the story, but you tell it so well. - That's an important skill. - Thanks. But people say he has a temper. - He doesn't! - "He has a short fuse!" - Fuck off! - That's a lie! - Fuck all his haters. - Get it together, losers! He has people looking out for him too. - Sure he does. - They should watch their tone! - They should. - Right? - They should watch out. - I'll fuck them up. - We'll chop them up, man! - Of course, man. - I'll do it! - Calm down. No, man. I can't calm down if it's about him. What are you doing? Yılmaz? Is that him? Is that Yılmaz? Let me see. Yes. It's me. You left the turpentine barrel open. Look at your eyes. You two look like hell, for God's sake. And what is this? This is not a tavern. It's a body shop. What are you doing here? We were waiting for you, man. We were just chilling. I'll just... Do you want a cup of tea? No. Hand me a beer. There should be a few in the bag. I'm a hot mess, man. What have we gotten ourselves into? God help us, guys. Amen. You're mad at me, right? I didn't do it on purpose, man. Who would do this on purpose? How was I supposed to know this would happen? No, man. I'm not mad. We'll get out of this mess together. We already talked about that, man. He said, "He didn't have anyone. Don't worry about that." - That's right. He didn't have anyone. - No one's going to look for him. - So nothing's going to happen. - Is that so? "He didn't even have anyone, so no one will look for him." What about in here, man? What are we going to do about it? We've sinned, guys. What are we going to do about that? I mean... I didn't really think about that. Fuck, man. Just be thoughtful for once. We tore down his car too. We need to get rid of the parts. I did think about that. I'll go sell them tomorrow. - Don't worry about that. - Just stop. You stay out of it. We're not to make a dime out of those parts, okay? We've sinned enough. Got it? - Got it. - Sure, man. All right. Don't worry about the customer's car. I'll scrape the paint off. - I'll stay up all night. - Right. I forgot about that. You can't do that by yourself. I'll manage. We'll start in a minute. I'll go ahead. Give me something to do, then. I'll help out however I can. I'm sure there's something I can do. Of course you're going to help, jackass. Were you thinking of leaving? For God's sake... I'm coming. I just can't with him. I don't get it, man. I don't get it. I'm trying to understand, aren't I? Dude... it looks mesmerizing. It rocks, man. It rocks. It's seriously something else. How can we scrape this beauty off? Anyway. We have the formula. I have a question, guys. Does any of you have an idea how this happened? When a human dies, the blood rushes towards their lower body due to gravity. The upper layers of the skin start bloating in the meantime. Also, blood and sulfur accumulate in the body. In a nutshell, the turpentine absorbed the blood and the sulfur, resulting in that shade of paint. Once the blood and the sulfur dried out, their effect vanished with them. So you can only paint one car with one fresh dead body. - Is that so? - Yeah. Piss off, man. What are you even talking about? It's the person's soul. And don't forget my prayer. That's how the deceased's soul affects the paint. Hang on. How do you know all this? He was on his phone on our way here. Did you read about it on the Internet? So you planned this. You smelled money, so you schemed. You're despicable, man. You'd have us kill people so we could paint cars, wouldn't you? Of course not! We're not murderers, for God's sake. After all, the cemeteries are filled with the deceased. You planned that too? All I'm saying is if we were to do it, we could just grab them, paint the car, and put them back. He got all this from two minutes of research on his phone. Come on! I said if we were to do it. This'd be the way if one were to do it. That's all I'm saying. Ayhan, you don't have a heart, man. You really don't. You just have an overactive brain. Why would you say that? All right. I did think about it. I did look it up. I'll give you that. But the color just blew my mind, man. A car like this would go for 25 to 30 thousand dollars. But since, unfortunately, you don't want it, I won't mention it. Did I mention it? No. Leave, Ayhan. Just leave. Not like that, Ayhan. You don't seem to get it. Leave the place. Leave the shop and never come back, okay? Don't even come near the shop. Don't even say hi to us. All right? You're no good, Ayhan. Got it? Get up, man. Come on. Get the hell up! Mr. Müjdat, please show the gentleman out. I'm leaving. We're all intoxicated. We can talk about this later. Fuck off, Mr. Ayhan. We're all tense. This is not the... I told you, man. He should get his blood sugar checked. - This isn't normal. - Come on, man. - It isn't. - Talking about sulfur and all. - It's just science. - You just looked it up on your phone. - It's scientific research. - Come on. - They put it up there. - You have a good night. He kicked me out of my car. He kicked me out of the shop. Is this how it's going to be? Hey, you! Stop! Where are you going? Good morning. Every lot on this street has been sold. This is the only one left. Please leave. This is the only lot. The boss won't let it go. Say that again. This is the only lot. The boss won't let it go. Again. This is the only lot. The boss won't let it go. Okay. You said it three times. Now leave and skip your next three visits. It's Aynur. Just fuck off. - Welcome, Aynur. - Thanks. A cup of tea, Müjdat. The tea is ready this time. Oh. Thank you. Thanks, man. Yılmaz... Look, sir. I'll tell you what happened. It felt like the brakes weren't working. I got a bit scared. So I brought it to you. Do you know about brakes? Of course I do, Aynur. Don't be fooled by our job. Humans invented cars, after all. They have certain needs. They're not like the natural beauties God created. Not like you, I mean. Well, then. You enjoy your tea. I'll just drive around a bit and check. - All right? - Okay. Sure. The brakes are rock-solid, Aynur. No issues. Is that so? That's good. It was just a feeling, then. Well, listen. How about you leave the car? No need. If you're saying it's fine, it's fine. I have business anyway. I can drop by this weekend. Sure. If you're busy. Just don't speed for a while, all right? Just in case. It's most likely fine. Just leave the car when you have time. All right. Don't worry. I'll come this weekend. Thank you so much, sir. See you. Take care. "Sir." "Oh, sir." "Dear sir." She keeps making excuses to come here, man. The brakes, the stereo, the wipers... I swear she's into you, man. Shut up, Müjdat. I didn't say anything bad. - What? - You told me to shut up. Sorry. I didn't mean it. Force of habit. Go set the table outside. Let's have a few drinks. Come on. "Sir," huh? I guess I'll have to take it. How are you, Kayhan? Hey, Yılmaz. I'm okay. How about you? We're okay. We're done for the day. We're about to eat. Maybe a few drinks. Nice, man. You two deserve it. You work your asses off. You should have fun too. Enjoy it, then. Come join us, man. I'll pass, Yılmaz. I'm going to show Rıfkı's building to the construction company. You are? So the building is a goner, huh? Rıfkı's a goner too, Yılmaz. Who cares about the building? Hello? What is it? What? Where? Hang up. I'm on my way. What's wrong, man? It's Aynur, Yılmaz. She's been in a car accident. I hope she's okay. Move! Make way! Aynur! Oh God! No! Please, God! My sister was in the car. The ambulance took her. Hello? Come on, Yılmaz. Which hospital? EMERGENCY ROOM Ayhan! Where's my sister, Ayhan? - Where's Aynur? I want to see her. - Hang on. - Is she alive? - Wait, man. Just stop. She's in surgery. She's conscious. - Just tell me if she's dead. - She's not. How did this happen? The police said her brakes didn't work. She just rammed into the truck. Ms. Aynur's relatives, right? How is she doing? The surgery was a success. No broken bones or anything. She's been responding well to treatment. But there's a serious issue that'll impact her life negatively. Unfortunately, since the windshield hit her face, she's lost her sight. Why did this have to happen to us? Is there no cure at all, Doctor? There is, actually. But it's not available in Türkiye. There's a type of bionic eye surgery that's available in the U.S. due to advanced requirements. I heard it was quite costly, though. How expensive can it be? How much is it in liras? Or dollars? Considering all the other expenses, probably around 500,000 dollars. I loved a woman... and I almost killed her, man. I'm not even surprised at myself. Don't be like that, man. Come on. She's still alive, thank God. She is, Müjdat. She is. She's alive, but she's in the dark now. I took her light away. It's all because of me, man. It was my fault. Don't beat yourself up, man. Why would it be your fault? Do you know why, Müjdat? Because we don't know jack shit, Müjdat. We just don't. We don't know about brake pads, for instance. We don't know about physics, math, literature, art... Yet we act like we do. It's what we always do. We never say, "We don't know anything about this." We just pretend like we do, you know? If I had said, "I don't know anything about brake pads." "I have a buddy who does. Have him fix it." If I had said that, she wouldn't be blind now. We... We keep pretending we know about things when we don't, Müjdat. We do know about some stuff, man. - We do? - Sure we do. We know all about loneliness. We know about brotherhood. We know about decency. We learned that from our fathers. I don't know, man. We know how to treat people without discriminating. We know about our jobs. Remember what you always say. "The most important thing is doing your job well." And love. We know about that too. We love. We know how to love. We know we have to get up and keep fighting, you know. We do. We know we should never give up. We know there's always hope. We know all that. And we fucking know all about painting cars, man. You're right. We do that exceptionally well. Come on. Call the bastard. Ayhan, I mean. - This late? - Just call him. What's up, man? It's late. Are you two insane? I told him, man. He insisted. You wouldn't pick up. I told him that too. He cursed you so bad... - Now what? - Now we find the money. We have to. But how... So our mighty sultan summoned me, huh? I should come and go as he pleases, right? Just amazing. You've built yourself an empire. What the hell, man? What the hell is this? I'm really tired of this, man. I mean it. I'm sick of it. Hey, brother. Did you call me? I didn't see. I had tossed my phone away. Did something happen? What's wrong? Hey, Ayhan. How much do you think we can make per car if we do the Mr. Vamık's paint thing? - What? - Are you going to answer? I mean... A paint job on a modded car usually costs around 15,000 dollars. So I'd say around 25,000 dollars. Give or take. If we were to do it, that is. Good. You heard what the doctor said at the hospital, right? We all did. Aynur needs money. Right now. I say let's do it. Fuck off, Yılmaz, for God's sake. - Come back here. - What do you want? What? I'm here. Is this what you want? Do you want us to give up on Aynur? I'm willing to give up my way of living for Aynur, man. I mean... She's our neighbor, after all. She's your sister, man. Do you know what I'm going through? Do you have any idea? Don't you know the reason? Don't you know what I put you through to make some easy money? Mr. Vamık died because of me. Am I wrong? And this is my test. God's testing me with my sister. Aynur, your neighbor! Am I wrong? So just let it go, Yılmaz. Or I swear I won't set foot in this shop over again. I'll fucking ruin your life, Ayhan. Got it? Don't get bitter. Just don't. Not about this. This is about Aynur, all right? There's hope, man. Just a sliver of hope, damn it. We can do it. We'll give it a shot. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't. Got it? But if you really can't handle it, I have an idea. After the job is done, whatever the result, we'll repent together. We'll dedicate our lives to charity. All right, brother? All right? Can we really pull it off? Can we? We can. You two are brothers to me. Fuck. I'm in. Let's do it. Watch me work my magic. There'll be lines at your door, man. I need a sample, though. We need to paint a car so I can show it to people. Let's paint his car. He likes driving around. He'll just do that and promotes us. That could work, but what about the dead bodies? Don't feel bad. They're not strangers. We'll bring them back. Turn the light off, Ayhan. REVOLUTIONARY PAINT JOBS EVERY COLOR AVAILABLE Yılmaz! Müjdat! Yılmaz! Müjdat! Guys, everyone's crazy about it. They were all over the car. Get up. Guys! Hey! Yılmaz! Stop yelling, man. He's asleep. Don't make me hit you. He should get up, then. That's ridiculous. It's time to work. Yılmaz! Hey, Yılmaz! What the hell? Why are you staring? Müjdat? Hey, man. - Ayhan? - Yeah. It's Ayhan. Yılmaz! Come on, man. I haven't even slept yet. I took the car to the main street. People were all over it. They loved it. Then I told everyone it costs 25,000 dollars at your body shop. I sold mine for 25,000 already, man. We're finalizing the sale this afternoon. We already have three orders. Come on, man. - They loved it, huh? - Yeah. I knew it, man. You two know everything, don't you? I'm the only ignorant here. So it wasn't a dream. Come on, Yılmaz. You know it's for Aynur. Please don't be like this. We have orders. They're going to be here soon. We have to start. - Hello? - Here we go. - Hey! - I'll be right there! It's a nightmare. Here I am. Welcome, man. Come on. Let's sit over there. Do we have tea, Müjdat? BROTHERS AUTO BODY & PAINT SHOP This is exhausting. Dig, extract, carry, put in the barrel, paint the car, bring it back, bury... This is fucking hard on us, man. You know what? We can't do this by ourselves. We need help. - What do you mean? - I mean help. But who? I have an idea. We'll see. God's going to curse us all. I swear we're all damned. Don't curse at the cemetery, man. Why, Ayhan? You're digging up people who were cleaned, prayed for, and ritually buried, but my cursing disturbs you, asshole? Shut up, you two. - Cut it out, Ayhan. - Fine, man. Should I send Garfish to pull up the car? You're "sending" me? I'm not your son, man. Do it yourself. Watch it, man. I'll kick his ass, Ayhan. - He reeks of turpentine anyway. - As if you smell like roses. Only you notice the smell, you junkie. Hey! I swear I'll kick your asses so hard you two will forget your names. Hey, Yılmaz. - What do you do with the body afterwards? - We rebury them. That won't do, man. That's a sin. Garfish studied Islam for a while. Arrange a spot in the shop so he can wash them and pray for them. Then you rebury them. This is shameful, man. Forgive us, God. What's wrong? What are you doing, Ayhan? Why did we stop? They make the best börek in town. I want some. Börek? They make buns too. Get me two cheese buns, Ayhan. - You guys are unbelievable. - What the... I'm hungry, man. What happened? - They're not ready yet. - It's okay, Ayhan. Don't worry. We'll just sit here and have a chat. What could go wrong? Five jackasses in the middle of the night and a body in the trunk. I mean, what could possibly go wrong? You're a fucking moron, man. Just chill, damn it. - He wants börek. - I swear you're looking for an argument. - Oh God! - Shit. The trunk's open. I'll handle it. Who let this clown drive? - Why did you let him drive, Yılmaz? - It won't stay closed, guys. You're an idiot. - Yılmaz! - Idiot. - Yılmaz! - You're an idiot. - Take a look at it, Yılmaz. - Let me. Don't make a scene, guys. - It's the police. - What? Have a nice shift, sir. - What the hell? - What are you doing? Shut your fucking mouth, Garfish. - Did they stop? - Shit. They're coming back. - Are they? - Yeah. - Five guys on the street... - Quiet. Hush. Stay calm. Good evening, guys. - Good evening, sir. - Have a nice shift. - What are you doing here? - Just sitting here. - He's right, sir. - Yeah. Just chilling. Is that so? You're just sitting there, huh? - I swear. - I swear, sir. Well, he's standing up, sir. He's still the same height, though. Why are you here in the middle of the night? - Chatting. - Yeah. You don't have somewhere better to chat? We don't, sir. Cafés are all the same. Everyone's on their phone all the time. No one talks to each other. And at home? TV shows feel like they never end. The actors don't even talk. - What are you talking about? - Well, sir... What he's trying to say is that we're waiting for the morning prayer. We wanted to get some börek, but it's not ready. So we're just waiting for that. - Morning prayer, huh? - Yes, sir. Definitely. And when's the morning prayer? In Türkiye? No. In Sweden. 4:22 a.m. in Sweden, 5:45 a.m. in Türkiye. - "İnna atayna kel kevser." - "Feselli lirabbike venhar." All right, then. Have a nice prayer. Thank you so much, sir. Have a nice shift. - Have a nice shift. Thanks. - Thanks, sir. - Have a nice shift, sir. - Good night, sir. What now? God, please show us a way so we... Guys. - What are you doing? - Celebrating his military service. The best soldier is our soldier The best soldier is our soldier - Here? This late? Like this? - It's paid service, so we're being subtle. - Tell us when the börek's ready. - For God's sake... - Come on, guys. - One, two, three. God! I'm so curious about the paint you guys came up with. Aynur... I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say. Hi, Aynur. I'm so sorry. I just found out. How are you? Well, as you see, I can't see. - Hope you get well soon. - Thanks. - Mr. Müjdat. - Ms. Meral. You were going to show me your special tea recipe. I was, but I'm a bit short on ingredients. See, we've been so busy. I didn't have time to shop. We're out of ginger and cloves. Pretend we're not, Müjdat. Come on, then. I'll show you. Cloves? Everyone's talking about the paint. I heard you partnered up with my brothers and you were all saving for the surgery. I don't know how I'll ever repay you, sir. Thank you so much. Forget about it, Aynur. But can you ever forgive me? I told you the brakes were fine. The issue wasn't the brakes. It was fate. It was meant to happen. Yesterday, I had light. Today, I don't. But you never know. Maybe tomorrow will be bright again. You never know. Right, Yılmaz? All right, my cavalrymen! It's time for lunch. Ground beef pide and tea! Hey, Aynur! What are you doing here? I just arrived. The timing always sucks. What was that? I said the timing was perfect. We're starving, you know. Let's eat. We will, but I need to talk to you first. - Hold this, Aynur. - What? Just hold it tight. There you go. Garfish, help her. Come, man. Garfish, help Aynur. I was about to give Ms. Meral the clove tea recipe, Garfish. So you first poison with your words and then with your tea. She's curious. None of your business. You guys are so cute. I admire you. What's up? Bad news? We hit the jackpot, man. - What? - Mass production. Are you talking about the coffee vans? No, man. Fleet vehicles. Twenty cars. A rental car company or something. No discounts either. 25,000 dollars per car. Are you insane, Ayhan? Seriously, man. We almost collected the money. How can we paint twenty cars? Let's say we did. What are we going to do with the money? Why are you like this? Just why, man? Why do you have such a short temper? You think I don't see what you've been doing for her? Let's just do a few extra ones so you can have some money to build yourself a life. Otherwise, I don't want to see another dead body either. No. Just no, Ayhan. I don't think I can ever "build a life." There's just no way. Let's just get the money so she can see again. And that'll be that, okay? Making more will render us sinners. - You're right, brother. - Right? All I need is for her to see again. Look at her. Stay away from the car, honey. We don't want it to get scratched up. Wow! Aynur? Oh, my beautiful sister. The best sister one can ever want. You've barely recovered, honey. You shouldn't exhaust yourself. But I was so bored at home. I asked Garfish to bring me so I could get some air. You guys weren't home either. I thought maybe you'd treat me to some dinner. Your wish is my command, honey. I will issue a decree at once, princess. Listen up, guys. We're done for the day! Time to blow off some steam. You're a good man, Yılmaz. Thank you. Don't thank me. You are, Yılmaz. You're the smartest one in the bunch too. Now, they aren't bad guys either. I'm not saying that. But, like I said, you have a big heart. You're different. Thank you. Some people's faces reflect what's in their heart. You're one of those people. That's why you're going to get everything you want from life. Trust me. Just follow your heart. You never know. That thing might happen too. What do you mean? I don't get it. Oh, you got it. Come on now. Cheers. I have such a headache. I had too much. It was a nice night, though. Yeah. It was nice. If Aynur's sight comes back... if she sees me again, if she feels the butterflies, I swear... I'll be the ground beneath her feet, the mat beneath her door. I swear I'll be her servant. Wow, man. Look at you. Such a strong statement. You love her a lot, don't you? "A lot"? Just "a lot"? There are some things you can't explain. You can only feel them. You can't taste them. You can't touch them. - You can't smell them. - Right. You can't smell them. But you can feel them. Think of it like this. You have a car. A diesel car, but it sounds like it runs on gasoline. It's like that. Imagine the sun has set. It's night. It's pitch-black. Then the moon illuminates your world. A full moon. It's bright as day, but it's night. It's like that. Imagine someone with a raspy voice. That's how they sound. But then they sing a song, and it becomes the song of your life. The best song in the world. Got it? You put it so nicely, man. Diesel and gasoline are totally different. The mileage differs a lot. It's completely different. One's gasoline, and one's diesel. You put it so nicely. I swear. That's what you got from it? There are senses... What the hell? - Stop. Stop right there! - Come here, man. Good afternoon, guys. You guys do such a good job. The cars look amazing, I'm telling you. We asked everyone. We looked everywhere. You guys are the best in the country. And you earn accordingly. We heard that too. God bless. We're good for nothing, you know. We don't exactly have jobs. We don't work a lot. We don't like working. So what I'm saying is that we're not interested in your formula. What you mix with what, whom you put where, how you do it... We're not interested in all that. That said, we thought it'd be better if we contributed to the effort. Since you're doing such an important job, we wanted to be there to defend you in case someone wants to hinder your progress or in case someone tries to rip you off. So here we are. Our motto is simply, "Do good and expect nothing in return." Listen, you dimwit. Whatever you heard isn't true. There's someone we love who's in a tough spot. We're trying to help her. We're going to quit once she's better. Got it? I think you're the one who didn't get me. Let me explain it once more. There's a saying about this. You know how they say, "They won't let you have it," whenever there's some dispute between people, be it inheritance, money, or land? We are the ones mentioned in the saying. We are "they." Oh, you mean extortion. There. Exactly. He's as smart as the Devil. Did you eat a lot of fish growing up? No, man. We didn't have any. I can see it in your eyes. They're phosphorous. You know what? I'm going to be devastated if you weren't able to study with that intellect of yours. It's okay. I have fine profession. He taught me everything I know. That's good. Have a good day, then. I'll see you around. It's best to keep visits short, be it a hospital visit or a business one. We'll surely see each other again. You two have a nice day. Let's go. Did they have guns? They didn't show us, but it felt like they did. He was a weird guy. Like, a show-off. Like... He acted all strange and stuff. I wouldn't call him mafia, but not a poser either. A poser? You know, the guys who wear tight jeans and smoke hookah. They're slimy and phony. That's who he's talking about. So they're just like you, Ayhan. Dog doesn't eat dog, right? Go talk it out with them. You're seriously hurting my feelings. I don't care, Ayhan. I don't even give a fuck if you split in two. Hey. Did he have tattoos, rings, and chains? Exactly. He did. - He had bangs too. - Yeah. Right. I know the prick. There's this big cliff behind the police station. He owns the pool joint there. Yeah. I remember them. He always eats popcorn. Gambling, cockfights, dealing weed... They do all sorts of shady stuff. How do they find the time to run the pool joint, then? They don't. - No pool table? - They have a table. - And cues? - They did have cues on them. Pool balls? - I didn't see balls. - No balls. He's infamous, you know. He throws people off buildings. - What? - He throws people off buildings. Whoever gets him mad while playing pool gets thrown off. He then plays it off in court as if it was an accident. - What are we going to do? - Nothing, Yılmaz. The money's secure in the safe box. We'll work on the coffee vans, get our money, and we won't speak of this ever again. Come on, Müjdat! We're starving here. - You hear the sizzle? - Come on. Here. Damn it. You okay, man? - Here. - Thanks. I don't know, Yılmaz. I just feel uncomfortable. I bet it's gas. You shouldn't hold it in. Rip one off. I have to hold it in, Ayhan. I have to. I'd call you a son of a bitch if we weren't brothers. - What did I even say, man? - Just eat. What's going on? - Come back! - What the hell? Come here, you pricks! Guys, Gürdal's men emptied the safe box. All right, guys. Now we're going to get back what's been taken from us like the men we are. If we make it out alive, we'll go have some night soup. Slow down, man! Slow down! Look out! Here we go! - Dude! - Stop! - Yılmaz! - Stop! Don't put your weight on me, Müjdat. Damn it, Müjdat! Are we dead, guys? Are we? - The trunk worked. - I told you it would. What the hell, Yılmaz? You blind? I wish. - Should we get out? - We'll drop you off just ahead, Müjdat. Shut up! All right, guys. We're getting out. Gürdal! We're here to take what's ours! How would you like this to go? Either you burn or we do. Motherfucker! Come here, you. Come here! Come closer. Here we go! - Damn it. Run! - Oh no! - Run, guys! - Run! It's his last round! - How do you know, Ayhan? - I counted, man! It's his last! What the... Hey, Mr. Vamık! I counted wrong! It's empty. He ran out of bullets. What's up, fool? Come back here. Wait, guys. He violated our workplace. Don't do it, guys. Please. Please, sir. Please. - Stop. - Don't do it, Kayhan! What have you done, man? Run! Come on! - Let's go. - Run! Come on, Müjdat. Let's go. We beat their asses, though. They look like their pool table now. Full of holes. Where are you going, man? I'm turning myself in, Ayhan. Don't be ridiculous, man. How am I being ridiculous? I screwed up big-time, man. I threw the man off the building. We don't even know where the cash is. I destroyed Aynur's dream and became a murderer. There's no escaping it. I'll turn myself in and do my time. Neither Aynur nor God will forgive me anyway. Hey, Kayhan. Listen. First of all, he was no man. The police won't even investigate us. He was a gangster. I bet they'll be grateful, even. Let's put that aside for a second and think about Aynur, all right? - How can we help her? - We can't, Yılmaz. It's over. It's all over. Come on, man. We can fix this. - How? Tell me. - Just wait! We'll find a way. Remember the job I told you about, Yılmaz? The rental fleet. - Can't we do pull it off? - No, we can't. We can. How are we going to get twenty bodies, though? Remember Nuri? The hardware guy. I'm sure he can sort us out. You can't buy bodies in bulk, man. Let's say we got them. We don't have the facilities or the crew necessary, man. We'll rent a bigger place. We'll tell them we're shooting a movie. We can always lie. We haven't slept in days anyway. It's just a few more days. We can do it. Am I wrong? We can't. We can't do it, man. We can't. How are we going to move that many bodies? My buddy has a box truck. I'll borrow it for a few weeks. See? Problem solved. No, man. I know you're going to call me an idiot, a moron, a fool, or whatever, so do it now. But we can't do it, man. Moving all those bodies... And you want to get another place. A place we don't own. It's a lot, man. I'm all for saving your girl, but... Hey! You're a moron, Müjdat. I told you to do it then, man. I did tell you. All right! I'm leaving.7 Don't forget to tell Aynur how much I love her. - He's leaving, Yılmaz. - What do you want me to do? God, please show us a way. Good evening. Good evening. Why are you here this late? You told me to skip three visits. This is the fourth. - The boss wants the shop. - Still? It's 500,000 dollars. - Five hundred grand? - That's right. Deal. I'm sure the boss will agree. - Seriously? - Seriously. If you're available, we can handle the paperwork tomorrow. Make it six. Good night. I can't, man. You do it. Six hundred! Six hundred grand! Why did you say five, man? NOTARY Here. What's wrong? I can't accept this, man. This shop is your livelihood. We can't accept this. What do you mean, man? Listen. You know I'm a dick, but this is too much even for me. Bring it back. Take your shop back. This is just... The shop's gone, Ayhan. There's no turning back. It's gone. It's over. - Look, Kayhan. - Yeah, Yılmaz? Since we don't have the shop anymore, can we work for you at the office until we can find something else? Why even ask, Yılmaz? The office is yours, man. We lost our home too, you know. Maybe you can hook us up with a place. For the two of us, you know? Of course, Yılmaz. Of course, but... Come here. Kayhan... Come on, man. Stop. Listen. It's not like we're homeless, man. All we need is some börek and clove tea. All right? You know how we live. Sorry. I'll be right back. - Hey, Aynur. - Hey... I don't know what to say exactly. Are you okay, though? What are you guys up to? What are we up to? Not much. You know, it's a bit... You know, you called me and... It feels weird. - Are you okay? - I am. Thank you. So... I wanted to ask... Do you want to go out for some tea today? I'm bored, you know. If you have time, of course. I don't want to burden you. If you're too tired... Tea? Actually, we were just chilling. No work or anything. Well, it's a good idea. I'm sick of the smell of turpentine. I miss the smell of sea. Let's meet near the shore. There are tea shops there. All right. Okay. All right, then. - I'll be there in an hour. - Okay. - I'll be on my way. - All right. - See you. - See you. Yılmaz? What's up? It's just the tax office. You know, since we sold the shop. They want to see some documents. I'll just change and leave. They're closing soon. Yeah. The result was a shade of paint we had never seen. It was weird. We were all surprised. All thanks to Müjdat. It's his invention. I mean it. Ayhan and I did help, but Müjdat... He's the genius behind it. Thank you. No need, Aynur. I'm not a stranger. What are you thanking me for anyway? For what you did. I mean, for what you guys did. I learned so much in such a short time. People spend months in the hospital in similar situations. So when they told me I lost my sight, I thought I'd be there for a long time. But the next day, when you guys told me you were saving money for the surgery... I thought, "Now, hold on a minute." "If this car surgeon can find that kind of money in a day, you can leave the hospital too." And I did leave. I don't know if I'll ever be able to see again, but that day, I got back on my feet. I realized I shouldn't give up. I realized I should stand tall even if I never get my sight back. No matter what happens to you, no matter what hurts you, you should always keep hanging on to life. And you should never forget that. Thank you so much for making me realize that, Yılmaz. Well, aren't you going to say something? You didn't call me sir. This is a first. I know you sold the shop. People don't just do that. Not even for their sister. That wasn't my cheek, Aynur. I know. I know, Yılmaz. What's up, guys? Thanks. What's up, Yılmaz? Did you find out you inherited something? You seem happy. What? Oh, that. No, man. They didn't mean to summon me, apparently. There's another Yılmaz who owns a shop, apparently, but our ID numbers are different. So... So they summoned me, but they didn't mean to. I didn't have to pay anything. That's why I'm happy. Look at him. He has nothing to be upset about. I'm hurting, man. My brother and my sister are leaving. I'll cut my arm off if you don't start partying with belly dancers in two days. I bet it's just gas hurting you. Just rip one off. Asshole. That was my line, you know. He's using it against me. I just got an idea, Kayhan. Hear me out. You mentioned partying. We're going to see you off, you know. A goodbye of sorts. And we're saying goodbye to our shop as well. Let's merge them and have a nice farewell party tomorrow night. With music and all. What do you say? We can invite Ms. Meral too. Do we have a deal, Kayhan? Hit it! Man, what an asshole. He basically surrounded her. Should I go save her? No, man. She doesn't need saving. Look at her. She's into him. You think so? - How about a drink? It'll help. - How about two? Get me two. I need two. What the hell? It's the police, guys. - Are they here for you, Kayhan? - Why would they be? I mean, you threw Gürdal off the... Who? Gürdal? Oh, right. Sir? It's him, right? - Welcome, sir. - What? Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. We're looking for Mr. Kayhan. Can you get him here? Or do you want us to look for him? Mr. Kayhan, huh? I'm Kayhan, sir. How can I help you? Are you the owner of the real estate office? Which one, sir? How many are there in the neighborhood? There's only one in this neighborhood, but there's another one up the road. They rented out a place the other day. They said it had sunlight, but it didn't. They also say they don't want single guys, but they helped one out. Yes, sir. They rented out an apartment to a single guy, but the walls are thin. That's all fine. Look at this photo. Do you know him? Ayhan? I mean... Do we know him, Yılmaz? - Garfish? - Aynur? I... I can't see. Mr. Vamık? That's right! It's Mr. Vamık! - Is that him? - Right. I'd never figure out it was him. He looks so different now. I'd never even guess it was him. I mean, it looks like him, but... - But at the same time, it doesn't. - Exactly. Was his car in front of your office? Yes, sir. And do you guys know where he is? - Do we, Ayhan? - I heard he was visiting his relatives. But it might just be a rumor some asshole made up. - Must be an asshole. - Right? - I don't want to misinform the police. - Pardon my language, sir. If he's not really visiting his relatives, whoever made it up is an asshole. - Exactly. - We've been looking for him everywhere. If you hear or see anything, notify us immediately. Can I ask something? Why are you looking for him, sir? He managed to evade the law for twenty years. The man's a serial killer. He's very, very dangerous. He used a saw. - Seriously? - How can he be a serial killer? He didn't even move much. Mr. Vamık, huh? What a shock. If you guys hear anything, notify us right away. - Of course. - Sure. You guys are having a party, huh? Sing "Kimseye Etmem Şikâyet." That's enough. Have fun. Good night. Don't cause trouble, though. - Good night, sir. - Thanks. Have a nice shift. I hope God keeps you away from the bad kind, sir. - Amen. - Amen, God. Amen. There are so many of them. We support the force! - Have a nice shift! - We support you! Come on, guys. Hey, Yılmaz. - Did you get up early? - No, man. I didn't sleep. Were you thinking about Vamık too? Maybe he killed people who moved his car, man. Why would I think about him? That's over. I'm thinking about Aynur, Müjdat. How am I going to last a month without her? You can do it, man. You'll think of her, and she'll think of you. You'll miss her, and she'll miss you a lot. Then she'll be back. She'll see you for what you are. You'll look at each other. You'll run to her in slow motion and give her a hug. You'll sweep her off her feet and turn around. You put it so nicely. God bless you. We're leaving in a minute. Let's go to the airport and see her off properly, all right? - There you go. That's the spirit. - Thanks, man. I have a question. You're not hung up on Meral, right? After last night. No, man. I'm not. We have different mentalities anyway. She moved here. A place that's getting demolished. She fancies Ayhan over me. He's like two feet tall. And, I don't know, he has become a brother to us even if we didn't like him at first. I'll respect Meral's wishes. It's the right thing to do. That's my brother. I swear to God you're a good man. You have a pure heart. It's pristine. Thanks, man. It's how we were raised, after all. We managed to took care of it all, man. We did, brother. We did. Pray it all ends without any hiccups. You saw her, right? She was so excited. God help her. God will help her. Don't worry. I'm sure we'll get the great news. I hope so. Don't get mad, but I have a question. Müjdat, I get nervous when you start your sentence like that. Anyway, shoot. Well, can we paint two more cars? Come on, man. We talked about this so many times, man. No. That stuff is over. Just two cars, man. For the two of us. Let's do something for ourselves for once. - No. - Just two. No, Müjdat. We wouldn't have done this for ourselves. All right? And why is that? Because this is how we were raised. We live for others. Remember what our fathers said. "Even if you don't have a drop of water, you'll still carry water to others." - You remember? - Fuck off, you bastard! What the hell? Don't come near me. I'll do it. One eye goes for 250,000 dollars. Mine are blue too. You fuck off too! Leave me alone already! - What's going on? - You brought me here from the orphanage. I was just fine there. They'd admit me to a mental hospital. A free life. But you brought me here and talked about fathers and working. You told me it's the most valuable thing. But what is it worth? We have nothing. You fell for a woman, so we've been digging up people. I just wanted something for myself, man. Now you're talking about water. Fine. I didn't have money or food. But now I won't even have water, you fuck? Hey! - "You fuck" was a bit too much. - I agree. Well, then. It's late. I'll go to bed. You do that, brother. Good night, man. Take a glass of water with you. Drink it through the night. - It's just dehydration. - All right. Good night, then. The number you have called cannot be reached at the moment. I can't reach any of them. Did you call Garfish? Are they there yet? No, man. The office is closed. It is? Well, Kayhan's not here, you know. I bet they're being lazy. No, man. It's closed for good. What? The place was empty. I peeked inside. The door was locked. Weird. That's weird. So I got curious and tried Facebook. They all fucking blocked me. - Blocked you where? - On Facebook. You can't see anything about people when they block you. - What's up with the cigarettes? - Kayhan left them. Tell me again. What was it? Facebook? They all blocked me, man. Weird. That's weird. That's so weird. That's really weird. You okay, man? So weird. The reasoning behind the court's decision will be in the final case file. In accordance with Article 151/1 of the Turkish Penal Code, and at the court's discretion, the defendants are hereby sentenced to one year imprisonment. Yılmaz? Are you okay? I'm not okay, Müjdat. They played us like a fiddle, Müjdat. He kicked me out of the shop. Is this how it's going to be? Hey, man. Let's meet at the office. I swear it's real, Kayhan. To hell with Yılmaz. We'll try it ourselves. He reeks of turpentine anyway. I can't do it, guys. I can't do that to Yılmaz. Please, guys. We've been talking for an hour. It's not like we want to do it. You know how it is. It's for our family. Come on, Aynur. That's my sister. Good girl. CASTING AGENCY That one. He could play the doctor. - Yeah. - Right? Look at him. He looks just like a doctor. - Right? - Yeah. Ms. Aynur's relatives, right? Right. Thanks, man. You're the best. - Go on. - Keep it coming. Stop! - From the agency, right? - Yeah. - Your name? - Şebnem. - Hi. Are you the actress? - Yes. Great. Come. My brother will be here in a minute. - He'll be like, "What happened?" - Right. And you're going to say, "We don't know. The ambulance took her." - All right. - Are we clear? Awesome. They had the money, man. A million dollars. That's twice the initial amount. But it wasn't enough. It just wasn't. The rental fleet. Can't we pull it off? Some of the guys are regulars on TV, sir. - Can you go easy on the beating? - Sure. - Of course. - It'll be fine. Pick up the pace, guys. Come on already. Come on. Is the wall still not ready? - Almost, sir. - Here, sir. - Good. Put it there. Come on. - All right. - Here, sir. - Nice. Listen. When he throws me off the building, you hit the siren. Off you go. You, to your spot. Come on. Beautiful. Are we clear, guys? I'll be giving 750 liras to everyone who manages to take a good beating. - Woo-hoo! - Nice. Listen. Here's the deal. Just go flying in the air like a missile the moment they hit you. - Deal? - Deal! - We ready for a beating? - Yeah! - Are we? - Yeah! Nice. Here we go, then. - Good luck, guys. - Woo-hoo! No matter what happens to you, no matter what hurts you, you should always keep hanging on to life. And you should never forget that. Thank you so much for making me realize that, Yılmaz. Oh... Now I get it. Get what? Meral was in on it, man. There's no way she'd pick that midget over me otherwise. It's only logical, man. You look a bit too happy, considering. I don't even know what part to be more upset about, Yılmaz. I swear I don't know, man. Help me pick, Yılmaz! - You used to call me sir, you know. - Not anymore. We saw what the one called you sir did to us, after all. You're right. - Right, man? - Yeah. Yeah. We screwed up bad, man. We really did. - Hey, Müjdat. - Yeah, Yılmaz? This was the worst thing that happened to us, right? Now it's not. Here's something worse. It's the magician. Don't film us. Hey, man. Stop it. Just do your job. Stop filming, though. - Just a few close-ups. - What's he on about? We asked you to vacate the shop, but you two went and dug up graves. But you know what? The boss is a fan. Can't get enough of your tapes. I'm on tape too? You are. But don't worry. Like I said, the boss is a fan. We'd like to do business with you. Listen, man. We don't do that anymore. It's over. It's behind us. Done. Oh, you're going to do it. This is just the beginning. Is that so? Hey, man. Are you seeing what I'm seeing? Weird.
