Local Children What do you mean? Has war broken out? We caught them in Belgium! We're thrashing them, Gustave! Nothing will happen in France! - Ah, I was sure of it! Where's it happening? In Gembloux, 300 kilometres from your village! Look at your map, Gustave! Morning Mr Soft-dick! Morning Mrs Fat-arse! May 1940 Gembloux! The Ardennes Forest. And over here, there's no danger. That's where we are. - It'll be over in two days! What do you say to that, Gustave? - I say that if we'd attacked them earlier, the villagers wouldn'tt have dithered so much. They're gone, all of them! - Morning fishies! - I had to make my cider all by myself. Not to mention all the apples I lost with this fucking winter. - I've heard all that before. Can you deliver the 5000 bottles for Sunday or not? - Well, I mean—first you'd have to pay for your previous orders. - Didn't I give you the coupons, Gustave? - Oh coupons, coupons— What do you want me to tell you? Coupons, they're here, all the coupons. Look—the only paper I want is banknotes. - Listen, don't forget I'm an HQ quartermaster! I get stuff from everywhere and I don't always have the requisition slips. Go on! I'll see if I can pay you. I'll be there in two days. We'll celebrate victory, OK? Bye Gustave! - Bye Pâquerette, bye. Good grief! I can't believe it! This bloody war! Camille. What are you doing in my room? The cow was in the street. You forgot to tie it. It's up to you to take care of it. - You're still not dressed? Morning Grandpa. - My little granddaughter's so lovely. Etienne, go and grab a kilo of potatoes from the Barbiers' stash. And a nice rabbit from the Pontels' hutch. - There's only one left. We've already eaten all the others. - I'll skin it. - By the way, I talked to Pâquerette, the quartermaster. The one who came last month. He's coming back. We have to finish the order by Sunday. We don't have enough bottles at the distillery. We'll have to get back the bottles we sold to the villagers. - But they paid for the— - Oh, I know, I know. Here! See that? That's a red ration coupon. For twelve bottles. We start with Jacquot's bar. - Can I roll it? - You use too much tobacco! You waste it! D'you hear me, you ruffian? You got a match? You can swagger about, but those stripes you got last time? You didn't deserve them. You left far too quickly, my little Jacquot. Anyway. Requisition! Your stock of cider? You can forget it. Camille, don't upset your little brother. But this time it's real. - Has war broken out? - Yes, but it's—it's very, very far away. In Belgium. So believe me. HQ told me again this morning: Nothing will happen in France. And we've got the forest here. It's impassable. Come on! Let's get to work! Camille! - What? Stop! Camille! - What's the matter? Stop it! Stop bothering your sister! What's all this? What the hell are you doing here? Relax with that knife! It's all right, all right. OK! Do any of you understand French? Good morning, Monsieur. I can understand your astonishment, but don't be frightened. We are French soldiers. From the French colonies. I'm not frightened, just surprised. And of course, well, you see, I know—the Colonies. But anyway! What are you doing here? In my village? Where's your white officer? - Sorry monsieur, I don't mean to offend— but I'm not authorised to explain myself to a mere civilian. - Ah yes, yes, well—that's where you're wrong! Because I'm not a mere civilian but a veteran of the last war. I talk to military HQ every day. So now, you can answer my question: What are you doing here? And where is your white officer? - I am Master Corporal Malick N'Diaye, 12th Regiment of Senegalese Tirailleurs, 1st Colonial Infantry Division based in Verdun. The Belgians were slow to call us last night. So it created traffic jams on the main roads. But you must already know that. - Yes! - In the confusion, we were separated from the head of the convoy. - Ah yes, I see, you're lost— Well, you're still 300km from the Gembloux pass. If that's where you're going, yes? Well? Is that where you're going or not? It was our commander, at the front, who had the orders for our position. But— since you speak to HQ every day— you will help us, monsieur, won't you? - Yes, I will! Exactly! All right, I'll fix this for you. They're wearing French uniforms. But that one's young. - They speak French, too. Well, they don't talk quite like you and me. They speak Forofifon. Forofifon is basic French which you colloquially call petit nègre. It's pidgin French. But of course, what's French itself but pidgin Latin? We taught them it on the boat so they can better understand the orders through the manuals. And so that we, the officers, can better understand them too. And it's also our duty to civilise them, which is so important in our army, I think. And what is certain is that they will all speak French much better after the war. Here's a Forofifon manual. - Oh right. Anyway, you speak good French. - Thanks. Why is the whole village empty? - Because they're stupid! This winter's alerts frightened them. But it's better like this! Nice and quiet around here! At least—It was quiet. I'll come back to give you the orders. Soldiers. At ease! I have a Code 3. - What? Captain, I have Gustave wanting to speak to you. It's a Code 3. - Why's he got a radio? - Well, he provides us with cider. - This is Eagle. German spies in your village? - No. I have six tirailleurs from the 12th RTS in my village. That's your "top secret"? I don't have the 12th in my zone. I'll call you tomorrow. 7 a.m. To give you their position. - Are you mad? No! No! I can't help it if your HQ's in a mess! No, but I'm not keeping them in my village! - Who do you think you're talking to? We're at war! I have more to think about than your six tirailleurs! - They're not my tirailleurs! Fine, they can go back where they came from, since you don't know the position! - You keep the tirailleurs! Keep them in your village! They've been hanging around combat-ready for nine months. So one more day won't matter. These guys are like lions. It's not complicated, you don't have to feed them. Just let them go at the last moment. - What about my granddaughter? What shall I do? - Send her to us. We're bored around here! Tomorrow! 7 o'clock! Have a good day! Out! - Ah yes, that's it! Have a good day! That's it, shitty Eagle! I shit on your head. For sure— You didn't take it with you, did you, Jacquot? How could you do that to me? Ah, there it is. The kepi! Finally! Hello, little toubab. Mmm, Sagui! Nyaamde! In Sédan, last winter, they were talking about that. They were saying it makes the Germans even more angry, seeing them with our troops. Because of the fighting in '18. - But are they a danger to us? Well, it looks as if their corporal can hold them in check. But— You never know how it'll turn out. And it pisses—pisses— There we go, and—stop. Is the jacket ready? In '14 there was a rumour that these troops were eating human flesh. - What? - Yes well—don't be afraid, Camille. Don't be afraid. Now that I'm going to be a sergeant, I'll be giving them orders! I'll be in charge! You just have to stay away. But don't worry. Go back home and lock yourself in. And if anyone comes you ring the bell. In the meantime, I—I have to run the business. - The black French soldiers are in the meadow by the mill. - They're not French. They're colonials. You know, the black soldiers' grandpa, because they're black— he said hello to me. Why are they black? - Why? Don't start! Damn! Right, well— You're not going to see them any more! Understand? - You know what? The black soldiers' grandpa looks a bit weird. He's got loads of necklaces, like girls have. You want to see them? - But Etienne, Grandpa's just said they're not like us. They can say hello to you and then turn nasty. You're still young. You don't understand everything. - When my friends come back, will they be taller than me? - Show me. One Two Three Hup! No, no, they'll still be little boys like you. Anyway, promise me you won't go to see them. Promise. - Cross of wood, cross of iron if I lie, I'm going to burn. Tirailleur, is there any need to fight? We need to be civil. How do you say "gun"? - Moundouk. - Moundouk. And how do you say "battle"? - Bituba. - So how do you say "I go into battle with the gun"? - Na buke ne bituba na moundouki - Na moundouki? - Yeah. You do understand that by the time we say that, we'll have lost the war. - Look at him. Does he look as if he's understood anything? - Massamba. - Massamba, na buke ne bituba na moundouki. - Hey, Corporal. - Attention, Tirailleur! Attention! Attention, the toubab's rabbit! You move backward. You're cheating. My turn. Two. The water's no good. It's for the animals. There's a spring near the mill. - At your command! Shit! The rabbit! - Sergeant! Sorry Sergeant! Really sorry for thinking you were a mere civilian. You see, sometimes appearances are so misleading. - You know who you're telling that to! - To you, Sergeant. - They asked me to come back on duty. One white officer per colonial unit! You'll have your marching orders tomorrow. - Corporal, village huts, we can in it to sleep? - Couldn't we sleep in one of these abandoned houses tonight? To better regain our strength. - Too much marching? - Yes—No! No, there's never too much marching when duty calls. - Yes, of course. Good! Now, introduce me to your men. - He's Bha. He's a Fulani from Dahomey. The best guides. The Fulani are nomads. They are everywhere but they live nowhere. At home, he was a shepherd. Here, he's the youngest. He does the chores. And these two are Mossis. From Upper Volta. They don't like the Fulani very much. - Great. - And him— He's a warrior of the Bambara race. The greatest warriors of Senegal. He doesn't speak Forofifon. But he doesn't understand it either. - And what about the old fellow there? He's dressed up to go to the ball, isn't he? But he caught the wrong bus. - No, he's their marabout. He fought in the Great War like you. - Him? In the Great War? - Yes! And he came back to pray for our brethren. We all stand together to defend the Motherland, Sergeant. - Where was he? - The Chemin des damnés, Sergeant. - Oh yes. - The Chemin des dames—but it's the same thing. Right! Two of you guard the camp, and the rest— The rest of you, follow me. As for the village huts— That's a No! As for food— If you don't have enough, you can go and pick buds. - There's work to be done at the sergeant's! Tirailleurs! Corking? - What do you mean, corking? - I'm sure they're capable of that. Don't make a fuss, get on with it! - Sergeant, they must not be humiliated. - Who's being humiliated here? Come on, get on with it! They need it up there. While they're fighting, you lot, you're here. - Calm down. - So— - Sogui! We must all participate in the war effort. That's an order! No, no, never mind your book! It's not that hard! OK, you know how to insert a cartridge. A cartridge into a gun. And whatever you do with your wife? It's not complicated, look! And there you go! Ah, there you are! You understand! Sentinel, you should be able to watch— should be able to hear everything. - Sentinel? Sentinel. He should be able to watch. He should be able to hear everything. - It's working well, isn't it? As tirailleur, you need to watch well. And you need to press gun. Him, he need to do what he need. No! He needs to press gun. You have to speak Forofifon. I'm asking you to speak Forofifon. If everyone speaks his own language, how do you expect us to understand each other? - What did he say? - He said that to be in good shape for the battle you have to breathe well. - Ask him, ask him, is he happy to go to battle? - Say again! - How was your girlfriend? - My girlfriend! She had a pair of boobs— Like that! It was magical! He says you have to breathe deeply. Oh there you go! When tirailleur go to battle. He needs to breathe very hard. Look! It's the good sergeant-rabbit! Brother Sogui, sergeant-rabbit, is good eating, is good walk in it. What's that? That music? It was Mum's record. You know that, it was one of her records. Isn't it cooked enough? You didn't make my bed? After supper! It's not important. We had a lot of emotion today. But it went well. You didn't go back to see them, Etienne? - What? - Did you talk to them? - Oh no, I didn't talk. - And what if we had? - What d'you mean? - No, no. Some mornings, I don't even know what day it is. Or if I'll ever again talk to anyone in the village. We've been alone here for six months. - Sit down, Camille! - I would like to leave the table. - What's happened? - Nothing. - Camille! What's happened? - I just told one of them where the fountain was. You let him come to the farm? I told you to ring the bell! I told you they're dangerous. Haven't I always protected you? - Yes. - Well then! - I don't think he was dangerous, Grandpa. - You want to teach me who's dangerous? - We should have left, too. - But Camille— Can you hear yourself? Camille! You want to leave? To go where? Our home is here. I was born here. You were born here. Your poor parents are buried here. Come on. Dry your tears. You don't have to worry because here we— We're in no danger. - There's no danger bere? You' ve already said that. If there's one thing you've always said, it's that. And the war? It will never happen? You said that too. And this record? I've never listened to it. It belonged to Mum. And now it's mine. And I want to have the right to speak and listen to whoever I want. - Well, that's just not possible! Stay at the table! Women are not like us. We have to argue a little bit because sometimes— It's—They make— OK, fine. Go on. My God, what's going on? Tell me, darling. Camille? Are you OK? Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. Are you sure? - Yes, it's fine, it's fine. Gustave. Gustave, to Pâquerette. Gustave, to Pâ— I repeat, Gustave, to Pâquerette. Gustave, to Pâquerette. Shit! Shit! Shit! Right! Right! Right! Ahead! Right! Right! Right! Right! Right! Right! Section, halt! Present arms! Reporting for duty, Commander! I can't make a connection. It happens from time to time. Maybe it's the clouds. We are too low in the village. Didn't your shepherd tell you, that yesterday, he spoke to my granddaughter? He was sniffing around her. She was very upset. Scared to death. - That's not possible. You're wrong, Sergeant. - Really? I'm wrong? They're good soldiers, yes? You keep them on a short leash. Just you wait! Wait 'til you see my report! Bha! Bha! You speak, Miss sergeant? Are you making fun of me? Not speak white woman! Pay cancelled. Arrest. Lamine, Sogui! Bha is under arrest! Hurry up! - He has no right, Grandpa. He's not a sergeant. - Sergeant. Where is the jail? - In there, in the hut. Put the old man on the door. The rest of you, we're going to pick up the radio from the church. So come with me into the forest. There's a ridge up there. A two hour march. From there we'll get— We'll get your orders. - Come on! Hurry up! Sergeant! Sergeant! I was thinking, if it takes two hours to get there, receive the orders, then it takes two hours to return— If our orders are to leave at nightfall, I calculated that we could— - You like your calculations. - Yes, I've found that— We could cork 600 bottles before then at 20 seconds per bottle. So everything is done by 3.30.. - That's good! - Yes! We'll succeed, Sergeant. It's for the hens! Why are you put in animal prisons? The elephant! The lion! How's your foot? - Rabbit fur. It's like a caress. It's super exciting. - Really? - I keep standing at attention! - No kidding! - You have to try! - Tell me, what recipes do you know? - Recipes? - Yes! - I know the ndomba federa. Or—There's another recipe I know and I do it well. It's the mbongo tchobi. - Oh, I don't know that. - It's a kind of fish stew. - Fish stew— - With sapak. You know sapak? - A little—I know the—Sapak? - Sapak. - I don't know it very well, but I can see what— I see what it might be. - Sapak is cod. - That's it! - When you don't like someone, you call him sapak. - Yes. - So it's morels? - Cod! - Oh, I thought you said sapak was morels. - No, no, it's cod. - Cod. - And it is really a delicious dish, very popular with children. And what about the—the older folk? - We let them eat too from time to time. - Really? ♪ Sweet France ♪ ♪ Dear country of my childhood ♪ ♪ I have kept you, cradled ♪ ♪ With tender thoughtlessness, in my heart ♪ ♪ My village ♪ ♪ With its bell-tower, its well-kept houses ♪ ♪ Where the children of my age ♪ ♪ Shared my happiness ♪ ♪ Yes, I love you ♪ ♪ And I give you this poem ♪ ♪ Yes, I love you ♪ ♪ In joy and in sorrow ♪ ♪ Sweet France ♪ ♪ Dear land of my childhood ♪ ♪ I have kept you, cradled ♪ - They've gone to the river! - Where is it? - Follow me! ♪ With tender thoughtlessness, in my heart ♪ My name is Camille.

And they drowned. Grandpa says they were drunk coming back from a ball. So now we're not allowed to go into town any more. Grandpa doesn't want a car any more. And my sister can't dance. - Come on. Come on, the river won't eat you. Come on. Come. There you go. Come on, hup!

Where do you come from? - Not Belgium? - But you're going to Belgium, even though you're from Africa. - Africa. Dahomey. Dahomey. - Tell me about Africa. Africa? Your eyes are a lake. I would like to dive into them. Your hair is wheat. I would like to stroke it. My hair is a palm-tree. I wouldn't want to scratch you. - It must be a beautiful country! I've never been there, although— When Mum was alive, we went to Sédan. Once. We went to the cinema in Sédan. They were showing Zouzou, a film with Jean Gabin. Zouzou was the name of Josephine Baker, an actress from the Folies Bergères. A black, like you. I mean—black—black? Yeah. - Just me African? - I don't know. I didn't ask her if she liked it afterwards. But I think she liked it anyway. I listened to the record yesterday, and it was good. I'm not thinking what I'm saying. Am I talking too fast? By the way, I saw you in my dream last night with Gustave as Zouzou. Am I ruining everything? At the Circle school, when I was selected to go to the Saint-Louis school— It really was a big surprise. My mother was a little sad. But hey, you had to be selected for this school of— Sergeant! Hey, Sergeant! What's happening? - My poor friend, I don't feel well. - Did you fall? - No, I slipped— - Tirailleurs! Well? - We'll fix this. - I don't feel good. I feel— - You need to hold on tight. - Thanks. - Lift slowly, slowly. Here we go. - But I don't feel well. I don't feel well. I'd prefer to be seated comfortably. Two hours to go. Thirty minutes to return. Don't be upset, Sergeant. You see, it's easy. Now I'll teach you how to canter. Start off slowly. Have you had enough? Forofifon! - Forofifon. Attention! March! Tirailleur Camille! March! Crawl! Halt! Well, men, I'm much better now. Right! We're going to have a drink! Come on, let's go. In Belgium, our valiant army is victorious. How far can we push the enemy back? To Russia? To China? People of France, fear not! Our beautiful country is safe. Sergeant. I've checked with the men. And we've really fallen behind with this bottle thing. So what if I put the prisoner to work? Baye Dame can keep an eye him. And tomorrow, even if we have no news, we can head towards the fighting. - Well, okay. As long as we load the cart before you leave, that's all. Right then. For the drinks and everything—two francs. It's not my bar. I have to look after the business. There's no— —What? Are you charging us for drinks? - Sergeant! - Oh no, no. No, I was kidding. Go on! It's my round! Go for it!

Get the hell out of here, you thug! I'll kick your arse! Don't move! I'm coming! Camille! Camille, open up! - No, I won't! - Open it! Camille! - I can't stand you any more! This is the first time I've been happy. You ruin everything! I'm very unhappy with you. You shut us in. Are you afraid of losing us if we ever leave the village? Well you're right. When we leave, we won't be coming back. Dad and Mum couldn't stand you any longer, either. They went out all the time. They died because they were running away from you. That way, my dad can continue to garden. My dad likes to garden. You won't tell anyone that? It's our secret. - It's our secret. - Wizard, if you can talk to them, my parents— Can you tell them I can swim? - They already know. Earlier, when you heard the wind speaking to you, you saw your parents' faces. Maybe it was them talking to you. Etienne, we have to join the others! - Did the animals smell something? - Yes. Let's hurry. - Grandpa, I was with the black wizard. The animals are telling us to leave. So are we leaving? - Do you talk to animals, Etienne? - I was talking to Dad with the wizard and they ran away. - Did the wizard give you anything weird to eat? - No. - Are you sure? Camille! Camille! Camille, open the door! - All the animals are gone. Even the birds. We have to do some— - Right, listen to me! I know what I have to do! You'll only have to pray for the fighters! Your marabout advice, save it for the others! Now open the door! He's— - Private Baye Dame! Open the door! Go and find the others so you can finish corking these bottles! - The bottles still? We're here to make war, aren't we? And the war is on top of us! Go and tell your sergeant! He doesn't even know how to listen to children! Moro! - Moro? Well— Moro yourself. And what does that mean exactly? Moro means "yourself". - Moro— I came to tell you— To ask your advice, in a way. Our marabout, you see— You know, these people sometimes have crazy thoughts. Our marabout seems to think that— The animals are leaving, Sergeant! - Really? Do you have a family, Corporal? - What do you mean, a family, Sergeant? - Well, family is all that matters. It's the only good thing on this earth, so we want to do what's good for it. And that's— - That's good, that's it! So— You have to be strict, do you understand? - Are you all right, Sergeant? Sorry, I don't understand what you're telling me. You don't understand? Of course, you understand! Because my grandchildren and I are alone in our village. I can take care of them, you see. I can take care of them all the time. Because we— We piss everyone off! What more do you want? And then—then, you, all of a sudden— Yeah, that's how it was, you turn up here! So what, then, we should leave? No! It's you who are leaving! Go and follow the snakes, birds, rabbits. Ask your wizard! - But, Sergeant, only you can give orders! - Poor bastard! I'm not—I'm not a sergeant. I'm just a Second Class from the Great War. Really, there's only you to— - Are you kidding? I'm asking you if you're fucking kidding! Sorry. Excuse me. - Yes I'm kidding, because that's what I like to do. I like to joke around. - Sergeant? You really are a sergeant? - Want an order? Is that what you want? Well, I'll give you one. You're getting the hell out of here! To Belgium! With all your men! And tomorrow, when I open the shutters— I don't want to see you! Understood? Come on, come on, we're closing! Get out, I tell you! Close the door! That's nice. What is it? - I don't know. Sleep, get to sleep now. Tomorrow will be another day. Grandpa, open the door! Open the door! What's happening? Grandpa, there's lightning! Grandpa, look out the window, there's shooting outside. Grandpa, I think there are bombs. They'll fall on the house! Open it! - I can't. We're locked in. - Camille, look! - Hang on. Lift, don't let go. There! Hurry up! Hurry up! Camille! For fuck's sake! Camille! Etienne! Sergeant! There are Germans here! They've arrived! Camille! It's not true? It's not true? Camille! My children! My grandchildren! - Your grandchildren are fine. They're in the church. Go and get them. You must leave immediately. The soldier Bha will help to load the cart. - Oh no! Not him, not that lunatic! - What's he saying? - He said: If the old man continues to piss him off, he's going to eat him raw. Along with his clothes. Hey Sogui! Sergeant! Sergeant! You have to leave. Go and hitch up the horse. Hurry up. - Are they coming with us, Grandpa? - I promise. Load the luggage quickly. And you're picking us up here, OK? Go on. What is it exactly? - Maybe a herd of elephants. What do you expect it to be? The German tanks are coming! How long before they get here? - They're slow. Three or four hours. But they will be here. All right, leave, leave! - What? You have no orders to give us? What's the radio frequency? - Yes, well—wait, I—I'm taking care of it. Hurry up. Then we'll get your stuff. This is HQ, identify yourself. Malick! Malick! They're answering! This is HQ, identify yourself quickly. I am Master Corporal Malick N'Diaye 12th Regiment of Senegalese Tirailleurs, 1st Colonial Infantry Division. Good to hear from you, Corporal. We've had no response from your Regiment. They shelled their position from the border and now control all the roads. We're relying on able-bodied soldiers. How many are you? I'm here with my five soldiers, but a column of tanks is approaching. I'm requesting an order. - Yes, for a retreat, damn it! Just say it! Say it! Too late for a retreat, you're trapped. We destroyed all the bridges behind you last night. If they cross the river, nothing can stop them. - So what should we do? We need time to regroup our forces behind the river. Hold position and create a pressure point. - You want us to hold position? That's an order, yes! - Yes, but—! But that's impossible! Impossible! Hold the fucking position! Senegalese tirailleurs are used to the front lines. We'll send you reinforcement. That's an order! Received? - Received! But how soon will you send the soldiers? And what do we do with the civilians?
