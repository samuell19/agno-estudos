No. That's cool. Cool? That's cool. Jinx, bad luck. Cool! So, it was good to see you again. I'll go see my friends. Bye. See, this one works. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Feel it actually. - Welcome back. - What are you all smiley about? What have you guys been doing? Did you find someone to get beer off? - No. - Nothing. No fucking nothing. That asshole that you followed into the store... He's not an asshole. He is an asshole, 'cause he wouldn't buy me any beer. - That's him, the asshole. - Dude... Hey, dude! Thanks a lot, asshole! Dude, you dropped your bush, man. Stop, stop. It's okay. That's what I thought. Pussy! Walk away! Oh, you're a pussy, man! Asshole! Yeah, no shit. No, not him. You, Cabbot. Wh... what'd I do? He's the one that wouldn't buy us beer. You made him drop his bush! Hey, I followed you. I see. I'm Penelope. Now you're supposed to tell me your name. Uh, I'm Freeman Brenner. Freeman Brenner? Strange. That's strange? Strange. I guess. How old are you? How old are you? Asked you first. 17. I thought you were gonna say old enough. It is old enough. Mhmm. So? 35. Oh, wow. You're old. Hey, uh, can I stay here tonight? Hey, where'd you go? I went for a run. Oh, how far? You ask a lot of questions. I'm curious. About? Uh, everything. So, uh, what are you doing today? I'm going to the track. Ooh, what kind of track? Horse. Can I go with you? I've never been. I don't think that that is a very good idea. Uh, it's a great idea. Hey, uh, what kinda candy do you like? I really... Oh, hold that thought. Hey, yeah. No, all is well. 35. Yeah, but he acts kinda ageless. Relax, Nell. Yeah, I know how you feel. Uh, no, I told my mom I'm staying with you tonight. Alright. Okay, alright. Jeez, bye. Uh, we'll just have to get candy on the way, Freeman. So it's race four, two dollar quin... - ...nella. - ...nella. On... Shit, I forgot. Can I see the race form again? Alright, okay. Okay, three and five. And I don't say the horses' names, right? No. See, that's the whole fun of it. I really just want to say, Grandpa McGee and Amalamadingdong but fine, three and five, boring. Next! Race four, trifecta, three, five, six. Here you go. Uh, race four... You have ID? I left it at home. Sorry, you have to have ID. Oh, come on. I... if you wanna place a bet, you gotta have proof that you're 18. I'm... I'm not 18, but I will be soon. Come on, please. Just this once. Fine, but just this once. Yeah, I will. Promise. Uh, so race four, $2 quinella on three and five. Grandpa McGee and Amalamadingdong. Couldn't resist. Nope. Good luck! Thanks. Next!

Go, Grandpa Mcgee! Amalama, go! Dingdong, go! Grandpa, go! Amalama, go! Go, go, go, go, go! Go on, Dingdong! Go on! No! Motherfucker! Yeah, that was fun. I can see why people go to the races now. How'd you do? I won. How much? About a hundred bucks. Nice. If you want me to leave you alone, I will. I do. You do what? I want you to leave me alone. Why? The age thing, it does not bother me. It's not just that. It... it... it... I'm not in a very good... safe place. It's okay. No, it's not okay. Please, Penelope, just stay away from me, okay? Stay away! Hey! Hey, man. Relax! Hey, hey! Get off of him! What the fuck's wrong with you? Hello. Do you have any availability tonight? I do. Where are you located, sweetie? Prospect Park. You don't look like your picture. I did 10 years ago. Would you like me to come in, sweetie, or? Please don't call me "sweetie". What would you like me to call you? Freeman is fine. So, it's take care of business first, huh, Freeman? Freeman, are you okay? Are you okay, Freeman? You can go now. It's okay. I can stay. Why would you stay? You paid me. Uh... Please leave. Freeman... You have my number. That was the fastest turtle I've ever seen, though. I mean, he put him right on the skateboard... Shut up, dude. Hey, man, you got a cigarette I can bum? Come on, man, eh. Just one? I'm asking you nicely. No. I don't wanna take 'em. Shit! Oh, yo, fuck! You... you... I know you. You're the fucking guy from the market. Ooh, shit! Ooh! Fuck you! Fuck! Get him! Fucker! Come on! Yo, you cool? Yeah, I'm good. Look at him. Pussy, he can't do anything. Shit! Ouch, Jesus fucking Christ! Shit. Jesus, man. Yeah, guys, let's get the hell out of here. Yeah, it's really dumb. Thank you. Um, I'm gonna see you guys. Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Hi. I just wanted to come by and say sorry. I shouldn't have, uh, I shouldn't have yelled at you. No, you shouldn't have. And I assume this happened, because of your sparkling personality. You should know that I'm really smart. Not by your decision making. How do you know my decisions aren't smart? Just because you think they're wrong. And by the way, you're in no position to classify what's right and wrong. Just because you think they're wrong only supports that my decisions are right. And I assume we're talking about my decision to seduce you. To seduce me? You know, make you mine. Seducing, isn't it? Hm. You resisted and I showed you that I was worth the trouble. I made you see me how I wanted you to see me. You don't know how I see you. Yeah, I do. Seven? What does it stand for? Foster homes. Clean slate. I love this song. Come dance with me. Do you like the chicken? Yes, thank you. How did that happen to your face? He was beaten up. Penelope, I believe your mother was asking Freeman what happened. I was beaten up. By whom? - Street people... - Penelope! Let him answer. I was asked for a cigarette. And when I said no, the kid threatened me. So I hit him. I shouldn't have, so his friend came over and hit me back. Doesn't look like you put up much of a fight. I didn't. I was wrong. Penelope said that you were in the service. Yeah. What made you join up, bruiser? At the time, I thought I needed something regimented. Dangerous. How'd that work out for you? It didn't. You do realize that Penelope is only 17 years old. Alright, she's a minor. I do. Penelope has told us that you will not sleep with her. And that you've done nothing inappropriate. So there's no way we can call the police. You do see the dilemma here, don't you? I do. We value honesty in our family and know that Penelope didn't have to tell us about you. Jane and I would forbid her seeing you if we thought that it would work. We are well aware of her independence and resourcefulness. Therefore, we've decided that she may see you, as long as it stays platonic. Our hope is that she'll just grow bored of you. I understand. Do you? Daddy, I will sleep with Freeman when he lets me. No, you will not, Penelope. Yes, I will. And he will let me. Uh, honey, is this really how we're supposed to handle this? This can't be the way. We have to let her find her own way. She's gonna do what she wants no matter what we say. Well, at least we could make it difficult for her. No, daddy. You always tell me honesty is the best policy. You should be proud I'm willing to share my life with you. Don't be smart, Penny. We are only doing it this way, because we feel we don't have any other option. This seems amazingly stupid to let our 17-year-old little girl date a thir... Platonically. Plat... Platonically date a 35-year-old man. He's a man, she's a child, this is crazy. It's crazy. I agree. Excuse me. You were great. I actually think my parents really like you. I don't think so. Oh, they do. They would've been much meaner if they didn't. I've seen 'em do it. Freeman! Go! Go, it's good. Come on. By myself? You love my daughter, Freeman? No. Will you? I hope not. Person you met inside, Freeman, I'm talking about myself here. Within the family structure, now I know you're listening, so I'm not gonna ask you to remember this. That person within the family structure, he exists... ...only within that structure. Get my drift? Yes, sir. I gather this is somewhat the same reaction you had when you received this beating. Yes, sir. You're bleeding. Care for my daughter. Grandpa! You wanna watch Antiques Road Show? It's on in five minutes. Grandpa? Dad! Jane just asked you a question. It's okay, honey... I figured silence was a sufficient answer. Well, not in this house. No, thank you, Jane, I'm going to sit here and read my newspaper. Boy, I will put you down if you condescend me like that again. - Really? - Yeah, really. You wanna go? Yeah. Hey, you wanna go, old man? Come on, you wanna go? You wanna go? You wanna go? Now I gotta go watch this stupid show. I'm sorry. Do you feel better? A little. Well, I do. 'Cause you called me again. We could do it again. Free of charge. Yeah, stay here. It's time for you to leave. Who are you? Penelope. And who's that? I'm a friend of Freeman's. Well, so am I. No, you're a hooker. Real friends don't get paid. You should go. He's gonna call me again. Just so you know. Penelope. Why do you call women like that? Why? When you can have me? Why? I can't have you. Calling a hooker is just as illegal as being with me. No, it is not. You don't have to pay me. I'm free. I want to give myself to you. You shouldn't. Well, I want to. I'm not afraid of you. I am 100 times more woman than... I don't understand why you won't be with me. I'm the one person who likes you, who wants to be with you. Really? Who? That hooker? You pay her! She doesn't give a shit about you! You pay her, Freeman. That's why you want me? 'Cause you think nobody else does? No, I want to be the reason you change. It's not gonna happen. You're afraid you're gonna hurt me? I will hurt you. Go ahead. Penelope, you like me, because I'm just fucked up enough to be interesting to you. That's it. So you think something has to be wrong with me to want be with you. That's just sad, Freeman. No, I think you're 17. You're just a 17-year-old little girl. I'm going. Penelope! What? Honey, what's wrong? What happened? Did that guy hurt you? No, no. Hey, Penny! Whoa. Hey, what's up? Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Here, here. Take this. Thank you. You look so sad, hey. Hey, whatever it is, I'm... I'm here to make it all better. Okay? Here, come on! Come on. Fuck that guy! Indeed. Uh, my God. Hold, alright. T-Pain! - It's not him, though. Is it? - Excuse me, hey. Seen Penelope? Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh... - Yeah, it's Jamie Fox. - And take me to shows. Hey, hey. Penelope around? Oh my God. What do you want? She's not here! Leave her alone, you're fucking 50 years old! Is it fucking... Make-out session. I know, right? And you drink that. What's this... this is the fucking... What the fuck is he doing here? Leave! God, leave! Leave or I'll tell the police that you hurt her and you'll be arrested! - Are you... - Babe. What are you doing? Hey, what do you think we're doing? No, we weren't... We weren't doing anything, Freeman. It's fine. No, fucking leaving him alone! Cabbot! Alright, Freeman, Freeman, stop, stop, stop. No, fuck, stop! - Stop! - Stop! Come on, I... let's... let's leave. I wanna leave with you. Let's go. Let's go. Penelope, don't! Yeah. No, I did. Uh, it was pretty easy like five pages. I'm at Freeman's. Uh. Uh, he's... he's out. Um, went for a run. Well, yeah, you've made that pretty obvious. Don't be so concerned. Wait, one sec. I'm back. Yeah, I know. Don't be so concerned. Yeah, I'll probably stay here tonight. Uh, listen. No, I'm gonna go. Okay, till morning, bye. Hi. Hi, how far did you run? Not far. How far? About 8, 10 miles. That is very, very far. Hey, uh, can we sleep together tonight? I mean sleep together, like in the same bed. That'd be nice. The only guy you know with long hair. Well, um, him. Got a good group of friends. Huh? I don't personally know Lil Wayne, that's what makes it... - I do. - You do? Yeah, I've seen him in my dreams. Oh. Yeah, you guys know that Mr. Crab? He wants to fail me in math. Fail you or feel you? He wants to fail me. He wants to feel you, too. But he wants to feel you, too. Yo, shut the fuck up, dude. He looks like a fucking crab. Oh, my God, the name... He does? No! Fuck, it was... Crabbot! Yeah, he wants to fucking fail me, cause I haven't been doing like any of my homework. But my tests weren't that bad, dude. I got like Cs on like all my fucking tests. Like that's not bad. He tells you you're gonna fail, because he wants you to really apply yourself. You come apply yourself. Get over here. What? Come here. Come on. Take your medicine, little girl. Jeez, you guys didn't have enough of this fucking... wow. No, I don't think we did. Mmm. Going all trippy. Thank you. Here, do you want? - You want? - No, thank you. - No? - No. - Are you sure? - Yes. - One little one? - No. - No? - No. Alright, fine. You're always welcome. Thank you. Very... Welcome. There you go. Hey, Penny. Can I ask you a question? Like a personal question. Like a... like a probing, in-depth kinda question. One that like I really, truly, and honestly wanna know the answer to. But if I ask it to you... If I ask it to you... Does that make any sense? Whatever. I'm gonna ask you the question, but you have to answer honestly. - Okay. - Okay? Yeah. Because if you just fucking pussy out and like lie about it, then it's gonna defeat the whole purpose about me asking such, like, an open and honest... Holy shit, can you shut up, dude? You're talking like a mile a minute. Please, shut the fuck up. Both of you... God, you guys need to fucking lay off this shit. Anyway, uh... Okay, so what I wanna ask you, I'm very interested that you're curious about this whole like question that I'm about to ask you. I'm gonna delve into it right now. I'm gonna put it forth into the world. My question to you i... Fucking stop? Asshole! What the fuck was I just saying? Fucking asshole, I just fucking lost my train of thought. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Shit. Alright. Penny, okay. Uh... Okay, right, okay. Um, before I was interrupted by my fucking so-called friend here, I was about to delve into the weird, and I use the word weird in like the nicest way possible. Okay. But yes, weird world of Penelope Ancilla. Ms. Penny, can you fucking answer me this question? What the fuck are you doing hanging out with an insanely old fucking crazy motherfucker? Oh, that is a good question, Cabbot, my friend. That is a question I also would like to know the answer to. Okay, leave her alone. Although, I wouldn't mind hearing the answer. There you go! See, you have a completely captive audience. We're just waiting on your every word. Will you just shut the fuck up for two seconds and let her answer... Oh, dude, shut the fuck up. I am, I'm gonna be quiet now, okay? Alright, can you please just answer this question? Okay. Alright. He's... he's cute, he's dark. And he... he needs me. Oh, and there's also this issue with this hooker. She uh, she wants him, too. She may just want money, but I think she actually really likes him, so. Oh. Alright. Thanks, Cabbot. I'll... I'll see you guys later. Adios, amigos. Got your answer. I wanna know what the hooker looks like. Mhmm. Okay, give me some more. Alright. Freeman. This is Penelope. Leave a message. Hey, um, it's me, um, probably at play practice or something, I uh... I was hoping maybe I'll see you later, so... Okay, bye. Vance, it's good. Just make sure she enters from left. Okay? Hi. Are you one of the fathers? Uh, no. A... are you here for one of the students. I'll have to ask you to leave if you're not. Sir? Sir, this man is here to escort you off school property. Let's go. Let's go! Just give me a second. Out! I said out! Carl! Carl? Carl? Call the nurse. Carl? Call the nurse. Now! Yeah, that... that will be fine. Honey, why don't you come with us? No, I got work to do. I hear it's great. Grandpa, don't you think you should go with us? Where? To the film. The film we're going to tonight. What film? Uh. Don't you remember? Oh, forget it. We gotta go if we're gonna get good seats. I don't remember agreeing to go to a movie. Dad! It's a film. And yes, you did. - Honey, are you sure? - No, no, no. I... I got stuff to do. No. Dad, go! What's with your memory? You getting Alzheimer's? Fucking film. Oh, God. Come on. Come, Grandpa. Go to see your film. It's good for you to get out. I received an email from school today explaining an incident involving a man attacking the security guard at play practice. How come you didn't tell us about that? I didn't think it was such a big deal. Still, Penny. You should let us know about things like that. A strange man lurking around your high school is important information for parents to know. You're right, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Penny. I don't understand how you could let something like that slip your mind. The email said... Mom! Jane, she said she was sorry. Keep us informed, okay? Your mother's right. Why don't we hear from Penny? What happened, sweetie? I don't think the school would lie about something like that. I... I didn't say the school lied. I said, why don't we hear what happened from Penny. Sweetie? Well, I didn't actually see what happened, I was backstage. Was the security guard really knocked unconscious? Yeah, I guess. Yes. Not yeah, yes. And you guess? I don't like the way you're responding to this. In fact, I don't like the way any of you are reacting to this. This is very serious. A strange man, at your school? I guess so. Holy shit. Dude, it's... it's Penny's guy. The fucking crazy guy. Holy shit. Uh, I guess we know where he lives now. Yeah. That was nice. Freeman. Freeman, I'm sorry. If you let me stay, you won't have to pay. I just came up with a bad business escort slogan. "If you let me stay, you won't have to pay." It's pretty clever, right? I... I need you to go. Isn't it time to stop playing with little girls? Get the fuck out! No. You know what, take this! I don't want it. What are you doing? You can't make me leave! I'm not going! I'm staying! Ow! Stop! Please stop! Whoa! Holy shit, are you... Oh, you better be fucking getting this. Dude, I am. Shut the fuck up. Okay, alright. Come on, come on! - Where are you going? - Following her. Hey. You guys following me? Did you guys follow me from Freeman's? Uh, I... I'm sorry. What? What, are you looking for a date? I'll tell you what. 500 for both of you. I'll even let you come to my place. Where have you been? City. I missed you. I missed you, too. I know. It's okay. Come on. Coming back for you. Oh, what do we got here? Mmm. Mmm. Oh, shit. No, shit. Your turn. Come on. You look nervous. I'm not nervous, I'm fine. Well, you're making me nervous. Come sit down. No, I think I'd rather stand. So this is a nice place. I guess hookers make good money, right? Not hookers. Escorts do. Yeah, escort, that's right. Cute. And you really like Freeman? I love him. Even after what he did to you tonight? Probably more after tonight. Hey, do you know... I'd wanna kill him. Oh, I do. Oh, did you drop this? This yours? Where'd you get this? Why? It was one of your clients? Who the fuck do you think you are? You entitled little fuck! You snooping around in my place? - No, no, no! - Are you crazy? No, listen to me... Dude, get the fuck out of my house! No, look, it's... it's a... it's... it's... - What? - Her father. Penelope, the cute girl, that's her father. Okay? That's her father. I'm sorry, I took it. Oh, fuck. - Good. - Yeah? What is it? It's, uh... - Shakespeare? - No. - Hamlet? - Uh, no, dad. - It's Death of a Salesman. - Where are your gloves? Left 'em at home. Well, I'm gonna pin 'em to your coat like we used to do when you were little. Oh, cool, with... with a string. Hey! Hey, asshole! Yeah, you asshole! Dad, dad. You tellin' me he's not an asshole? He bumps into you, doesn't say I'm sorry, doesn't say excuse me. That's an asshole, Penelope. Uh, it's just the way it is. No, it's not the way it is. Not when it concerns you. You listen to me. Don't you ever let anyone be anything but kind to you. - Do you understand me? - Yes, yes. Do you know what I'm talking about? Dad, what's with you? Nothing's with me. Oh, yeah right. Like all these questions. Since when do you care? I mean I know... I know you care, but you don't ask questions usually. The guy at the school. It's Freeman, isn't it? - What do you mean? - Don't... Penelope, don't bullshit me. It was Freeman, wasn't it? I'm not... I'm not sure. It sounds like it probably was. Probably? I don't like this. Hey, come here! You say you're sorry to my daughter! - You understand me? - What? Say you're sorry to my daughter! - I'm not sure... - For bumping into me... ...and not stopping to say you were sorry. I'm sorry for bumping into you without stopping. Just say that you are sorry! Just say... I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. Come on, baby. How's your play practice going? Good. Got me in trouble. Not that bad, but still. How? The security guard at school. How'd you find out? My father... Not the school. He knew it was you, so did I. What happened? I was looking for you and uh, someone asked me if I was a father or... You didn't answer and they called Carl. He's the guard and you assaulted him. Why? Freeman. Couldn't you've just walked away? Why did you have to hurt him? He's really nice. I know. You can change. I can't, okay? What would you do if someone treated me like you treat people? People turn on you, Penelope. Maybe. But you don't have to make them pay just in case they might. They don't deserve the things you do. You can't come to my school anymore. I'm sorry. Let's do something fun tonight. What should we do? Yeah, that'll be fine. Who was that, honey? Delivery. Ooh, which one? Thai Time. Mmm. Sounds good. Are you ready, Grandpa? For what? The play. When? Now. We're already late. Not tonight. Dad, just get up, put on your coat, and let's go. You said you wanted to go. Why aren't you going? 'Cause I don't wanna go. And I said I didn't wanna go. Just get off your ass! Shit. Don't say you wanna do it if you don't wanna do it. I didn't say I wanted to do it. You can't even get your coat on. Come here. I... I... it's alright. Oh you're... there you go. Ah... Yeah, you look very handsome. - Do you I look chic? - Yeah. You look chic. You look like a chick. Oh, God. Wow. Wow, I've never seen the city like this before. Do you come here a lot? I used to. Uh... Not a long time. Funny. I can stroll in the line of fire. Step over bodies. Charge a sniper, but I could never... Never felt... Safe? Safe enough to actually... to step inside the park. Until now. Man, I missed this view. You have to come to my play tonight. Okay? We could... We could get you like, uh, a disguise, we could get you a cap or you could sit in the back row or something, like we can make it work. You don't have to wear your hat. We know you. It was you. Yeah. It was. What were you thinking, Freeman? Why would you do something like that? Bruiser. What possible reason could you have to assault someone like that? He was only doing his job. Tom, we cannot possibly go to the play with him. Yeah, yeah, we can. Come on. We'll talk about it later. We gotta get going. Honey, are you listening to anything? Yeah. We cannot take him to the play. We can't... I would like an answer from him. Freeman, why? Just tell me why? Honey, we gotta go. He'll wear his hat low. Just put your hat down. Come on. Let's go. Fine, but I honestly don't see how we can take him to the play. They're obviously gonna recognize him as the man who accosted the security guard. It's just a high school play. Oh, I cannot figure you out. Honey. What? Freeman is looking way too suspicious. He's fine. There's no one here. Hey! Hey! Thank you for coming. Nice disguise. Very mysterious. You were great! Thank you. You were wonderful tonight. I really think you have a gift. Thank you, mom. Thanks. Not that I would encourage acting as a career choice. I've heard that only one percent of the actors make a living. Mom! Nice, it was marvelous. Yeah, you were awesome! Thanks, Cabbot. What are you doing here? I just wanted to come and see you perform. Oh, cool. Um, are you gonna come to the cast party? No, we're gonna have dinner tonight at home. But it's the cast party, everyone from the play will be there. Well, have dinner first and... then after dinner, you can go to the party. Honey, no... Okay? Let her... let her go. I didn't plan dinner. Ah, I got it all covered. Really? Yeah, come on. Let's go. Oh, thank you. So weird. Something smells wonderful. Hello, Mrs. Ancilla. My name is Elly. Your husband hired me to prepare a small dinner party for you and your family. Oh, that's great. Honey, oh, that's fabulous! Thank you. Oh, I'm... I'm delighted. Yes, would you like something to drink? Ooh, I would love a drink. Um, white wine would be great. Dinner will be served momentarily. Thank you. What is going on? It looks like your father has hired someone to throw us a dinner party. I couldn't be more delighted. What a fabulous surprise! Dad, I don't understand. Penelope, what's wrong with you? You're acting so strange. Your father did this for you. Show some gratitude, young lady. Uh, that woman... She's a... She's a what? She is here to prepare you a special meal. I am baffled by your behavior tonight. Dinner's ready. Fabulous! I am famished. And I have a wonderful husband. Dad. That woman... Just go to the dining room. No. Just go into the dining room. We'll be right there. No, I'm not going anywhere without... Just do what I say! No! It's okay. Okay. I see these pictures every day. I can't remember the last time I actually stopped and looked at them. Look at my baby girl. That's a cute little girl. My baby. Tried to give Penelope a sibling. For years we tried, but it just didn't take. You know anyone who's tried IVF? No. It's good, huh? Yeah. In vitro, it's a miracle for some people. Not so much for us. Needles, injections, countless tests, drugs, hormones. It was just fucking brutal. Ultimately, we had to make a very difficult decision. To keep trying, keep subjecting ourselves to pain, and suffering, and heartache or to walk away. So... so we decided to walk away. It was the bestest one... It was... it was the only decision that could have been made. You know what I mean? Yeah. I do. I'm gonna go see how Elly's doing with dinner there. Just take your time. Okay? Here's my gorgeous actress. Very, very formal. Where's Freeman? Uh, I don't know. There he is. Let's eat. But honey, there are seven settings. Yeah, Elly's gonna be joining us. What? Oh, how nice. Shall we sit? Come on, sit. I just wanna say a couple things. I wanna thank everybody for being here. Elly, thank you for this wonderful meal. It smells delicious. Thank you... Penelope, you were spectacular tonight, baby. I couldn't believe how powerful and graceful you were on that stage. It was beautiful, baby. It really was. I'm so proud of you. And I'm lucky to be your dad. Jane, uh... You look beautiful tonight as usual. The reason why we're all here tonight, we're all gathered here is... is to say goodbye. To, without sounding too cliché, but to... To make the world a better place. And Freeman, as you so eloquently put it earlier this evening, it's... it's an important night. It is. It's an important night for all of us. Is there anything you'd like to add, Freeman? This is the most people that have ever gathered for me. For... For pretty much anything. Thank you. Freeman, they're gonna kill you. I know. Leave. Let's leave now. Penelope. Penelope, what are you talking about? Who is killing whom? You're really scaring me. Daddy's gonna kill Freeman. Honey, tell your daughter you are not killing Freeman. Tom, tell her. Tom, this is not funny. We have company. This is not a funny joke. Soup's getting cold. I'm calling the police. You will sit down now! Sit down! Why is she here? Why is Cabbot here? Why are they here? She is a hooker, dad. - Penelope. - Penelope. Sit down now. Let's eat. Please sit down. Soup's delicious, Elly. It really is. Penelope, what are you talking about? Elly, she's not a... a caterer. She's a call girl. Freeman calls her. I don't know what she's doing here. We're all here, because there's no one else who cares. There's no one else who will notice. I think it's actually a pretty good turnout. Thank you. What the hell is going on here? Tom? I don't even know where to start. You invited a call girl into our house who is sleeping with our daughter's boyfriend whom you plan on murdering after we all have a fine dinner. This is not happening! And you. You should not even be here. I definitely should be here. I mean, I'm the one who found Mr. Ancilla's card in Elly's client rolodex. I knew you looked familiar. Tom. Tom. I would like you to leave. No. Did you hear me? I will not have you in my house. This is my house! My kitchen! My husband! You slept with my father? Yes, I slept with your father, your husband, and Cabbot, and Freeman, because that's my job. Get out of my kitchen! I'm really sorry that so many people got hurt. I'm sorry it got complicated. You hurt people every day. Yeah, well, then Freeman and I would be perfect for each other. Shameless tart. Mom, they're gonna kill Freeman. I know, sweetie. I'm really, really sorry. Elly, pass me the scotch please. I know what you're doing, dad. And if you do this, I will call the police and you will go to jail. Penny, you're not gonna call the police. That's not how we do things in this family. We're open and we're honest. And I haven't been. I did it this way, because I want to be. I want us to start over. Me, you and your mom. I'm sorry for what I did. I'm gonna put the past, all of it behind us. I didn't wanna do this behind your back, because that would be dishonest. Do you... do you hear yourself? You sound ridiculous. Is it? Would you have wanted me to do this without you knowing? No, I don't want you to do it at all. Why? It's the most human thing we could do for you, for Freeman, for all of us. Freeman will be dead. Murdered. How can that be the best for anyone? Freeman knows. Right, Freeman? You realize this is the only way? He doesn't love you, sweetie. He's incapable of that kind of emotion. Now I'm sorry, sweetie, but ask him. No, no. You don't know how he feels. You don't even know him. I know enough. No, you don't. I know him. I love him. Sweetie, I'm sorry. - You do not love him. - Don't say that! You have no right to clarify what love is or isn't, you slept with that fucking hooker. So did Freeman. Why? Stop this now! I have had enough! This is ridiculous! You do see that, don't you? What I see is that everybody wants Freeman to die. I... That's what I see. I don't. You don't want him with our daughter. No, but I do not see the need to kill him. Honey, what the fuck? Look, he's not gonna go away! Okay, if it's not Penny, it's gonna be someone else. Shut up, Cabbot. You don't know shit. I don't even know why you're here. Shut your mouth. No, I'm... I'm a part of this. Shut your fucking mouth! Shut your fucking mouth! Shut up! What do you think, Freeman? Pay attention. What do you think? About what? Whether you should continue on living? No, lots of people feel like they don't belong, that they deserve to die, but that doesn't mean we have to go around killing all of them. I realize that, but they're not with my 17-year-old baby. You understand? Pay attention to what's going on here. This is what Freeman wants. I'm doing this for him, not to him, for him. You understand? Freeman? No, I don't really... Tell her. Just listen. I agree. Completely. You can leave right now. I don't wanna leave. Won't you miss me? Baby, of course, I'm gonna miss you. But this is better for everyone. Not for me. You have to trust me. It will be. I don't wanna do this anymore. But this is your fucking idea. Yeah, I know, I changed my mind. Look, I don't... I don't care if you changed your mind, you fucking whore! Freeman, stop! Someday you'll understand, baby. You're wrong. I'll never understand. You're welcome. Come here. Come here, come here, come here. Come here. Come here.
