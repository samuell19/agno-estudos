Good night, sir. - Where are you going? Just for a small walk in car. Yes, sir... walking, aren't you going? Try to bribe him. - Take out the papers. Paper? Who are they? Talking to police, so confidently. May be locale goons! Boss, the police would smile at me also if I had Rs. 100 with me. Look at them, boss. They look like cucumber sellers at toll gates. Are they goons? Take out the papers. Don't have habit of reading papers. RC book. - RC book? Look, we've everything in car except the book. We're going to temple to offer onions.

Lord Muruga! Check thoroughly. Check all vehicles, don't leave any vehicle. Mustn't miss this time. Must find the idol smugglers by tonight. Okay? We're checking, sir, over. Looks like they'll leave me on streets. If I find the idol smuggler, I'll gun them down in encounter. I think he wouldn't have shot a bird also. Boasts about killing them in encounter. Sir, it seems all accused are inside. Don't know who is this? Open the door. Where is he? - Who do you want, sir? Where is he? Where is he? Don't mistake me, forgive me for coming at this hour. You're here, right? It's okay, tell me. Your husband AJ. - Oh no, what happened to my husband? He promised to come home with Halwa from Archana Sweets. I was thinking why hasn't he yet come. - Archana Sweets? What will I do now, sir? What will I do, sir? No need to do anything. - What will I... I said you don't need to do anything.

Police checked and said the boot is empty. Where's the idol? I've kept it in Swapnasundari vehicle. Safely... What the hell are you talking in presence of the police? Idiot... Stop here. They're torturing me with night duty. Go straight and turn right to Vallakottai. Don't miss the way. Got it? - Thank you. It seems we must go right to temple, boss. Why? To tonsure your bald head. Turn the car. Hey! Hey! What? Why did you kiss now? It seems kiss will burn the fat. - Who said that? Kajal Agarwal has said that. Did she say about kissing men? I'll kiss everyone. I'll also kiss. By all means! Get up! Security! Gurkha! No, the police! I'm a policeman for 25 years. Where is Pandi who runs a marriage procession car? He sleeps here parking his car after boozing. Yesterday, he went out for something but hasn't come back yet, sir. His phone is switched off too, sir. Do you know that matter also? Why are you asking me that, sir? We ate in the same plate and had drinks from same glass. Sleeping in the same bed... - Hey! I said, we will not sleep, sir. Why are you searching for him? To honour that bean pole with a national award. He killed a girl and escaped. - What? Killed a girl? Did he make a sweet then? If he comes back, inform Valasaravakkam police station. Got it? - Got it, sir. Switch off the engine. We didn't cross that car. They too didn't over take us. No way, it can hit that speed. Where did it go? Ganesh! - Boss! Inquire there. Musical line from the film,"Bigil". Brother! - What? Did you see a red car passing this way? That car? It went straight and took a right turn. How was the car opening? Like this or else... Don't get angry, it went straight and turned right. How far you were from the car? Did anyone spit from the car? - Hey, wastrel! Was there anything on the side of the car? Buffalo, he told you, right? Come here. That car. - You... - Coming, boss. They said Vallakottai but why did they change the route? Rock it! Musical line from the film "Darbar" You want to go that way? The drainage is broken and overflowing, can't go that way. Who is he staring as if he is saving the industry? Have relatives of the dead body came sniffing it? Can't you judge from his nose he looks like a sniffer? If you cross sword with Don, you can't go with onions. You'll get thrashed by him. What is this? Onions and thrashing! Why are you trapping me with him? What to do now? He is trying hard to get a reaction in his face. Take reverse. - Reverse? He looks very scary. He looks like he'll eat a bagful of biryani. Yes. Okay, boss. I'll take care of him. Feel free. Who the hell is he to touch onions? No... Listen to me. Go, he'll collapse everything. Wait, I'll go. We might need to take the car, wait. Brother, mustn't open like that. - Unable to open it? I'll show how to open it. He's opening it for them. - Must open it like this. Boss! - How is it?

He is coming striaght away to me. What's the matter? - I don't know. Hey! - What's it, brother? You were supposed to go to Vallakottai, what are you doing in Walajabad? The tepmle is closed by midnight in Vallakottai. They said, it'll be opened by evening 6 o'clock only. Found a girl too! I'm having great time with her.

It's an hour past on our scheduled exchange time. Come... - I've half an hour work. Why is he opening the boot and looking at it? Excuse me. Can you please keep this? It's my pleasure. Come on, lift it. - What's this? Circling like old PCO. It's not PCO but Python 357 model pistol. Okay, okay. - At a time, you can load six bullets. Is it? - Yeah. They have got the gun. Must enter the arena. Enough of your middleman job. - You'll see the real game of Kali. I'll leave this field. You'll see it. Don't tell tales. I'll finish it and come. Hang up the phone. There's only one such pistol. My boss bought it in black market. Look at this! Can I use it to shoot underground? You can shoot in underwear also. - Okay, okay. Can we shoot upside down lying inside water? You can shoot this pig. - Come, you too join to learn. If you load six bullets and shoot your opponent as target. Just only one shot! - Boss has come. What are you doing? Boss, he doesn't know anything about the gun. So, I was explaining him about it. Why don't you teach him to shoot also? Okay, boss. - That is... Hey, you... Not me, he asked me, boss. Not me, boss. Dear, because of your love, I've become a mouse. Gone, all of us are caught! Someone has come here, ask them to lift the bag, you fool. It's a murder case.

Lord, don't stop my friend's engagement because we missed the onion bag. We will somehow bring it to you, Lord. Lord Muruga! Vallakottai Murugan! If anyone dares to touch the idol, I'll blow up their heads. Brother, we're not touching the idol. The man next to you, I think he's planning to steal the idol. I'm in no way associated with this. Hey! - What's this voice? You look like M R Radha but has a voice like Radha of 'Mudhal Mariyadai'. Now I know, why sister- in- law has left you. Brother, Walajabad will fear upon my voice. You'll booze and blabber on road at night. Will Walajabad fear on your voice? Inquire about me in my place. First, look at your face in the mirror. You look like a teddy bear. I think your voice is rusty, take oil and relax for 30 minutes. We can talk after that. I didn't come to this position so easily. If you talk like this, you'd have got thrashed by many on the way. Did you see? - No, where did you buy it? My fate I had to tell you. May I read only one, boss? With your permission. Just a minute. What is he going to do? Close your mouth. - Why are you removing moustache? Brother! Straighten your tress and join Stella Maris College. Did you see what your guy do for me? I'm also a goon like you. - Hey, you... Not a big goon but a goon who just see the gun, never uses it. Why are you playing here? Keep the idol in car. - Okay. If anyone moves, I'll shoot them. Come, keep it inside. - Why pointing at me? Why did uncle call me so many times? Why did you call me so many times, uncle? Anbu, I'm Inspector Rajamanickam here. He's safe in the police station. Your maternal uncle. That too with the bag. How did the bag go to him? Come to station. Hey, hey. You. He threw it somewhere here, search it, guys. Who is on phone? The bag is in the police station. If it is there, tell the inspector to bring it here. Hey, bag! - Go. Get lost. What bag? - Laundry bag. Lie on. What did he say, Don? - It seems, the bag is in station. Is onion bag in station? It means we found the bag to fulfill the vow. Lord, I'm coming to Vallakottai in car. If bag is in station, I'll get caught, come. Come on, you goof. Whose bike it is, left with key? Get on. If caught, I'm done. Search it, guys. Hey buffalo! Search properly. What are you searching? I didn't threw it. This is very old style. Tell him to give the idol. No, give the gun, you... Tell him to give the idol. Boss! Did he join our clan? Looks like practicing to shoot. Good...good. - Shooting? Go, bring the idol from car and give him. Car? The car has left. - Left? Hey, our car is here only. Brother, that's not a car but a jeep type vehicle. The red one parked here is a car. When the car is parked, door is opened like this. Our vehicle is a jeep model. You told me to keep it in car, I kept in car. The red car has left. Did you ask me to keep the idol in car or not? You're so intelligent, right? Why did you wipe my moustache? Please, don't praise me high. What is sister telling you? - Wait, I'll tell you. Keep him with you, you can smuggle ten such idols. Come on, guys. The babe has left and so 250 Millions also.

If you pay my commission and his commission, we'll go away happily. Here it is! Okay. Brother... Hey! I bought the vehicle on loan. He will spit like bathing. Is it police station? A murder is about to happen here. - Boss, my commission. Twin murders. Next assignment? - I'll give you the address. Please, come. Tell me, what should we do, boss? - You! He started shooting again, someone please come and save me. The corpse has been sent to morgue, sir. Nephew, nephew - Uncle! Nephew... How God fearing today's generation are! Oh, no! Hey! They left the bag on ground! The number you called now is. Why have you switched off the phone? Nephew said the name of a marriage hall? I haven't told the address, yet. Are you guiding me, already? He said about a marriage hall, is it Subha or Shobha? It's Subha! Subha Marriage Hall. Okay, Google. Among people who misunderstand whatever we say you always understand whatever I say! You're great, Google! This is what I like the most! Google dozed off. What? Can you please drop me near Subha Marriage Hall? Subha Marriage Hall? You're not wrong to ask for lift. You're not wrong to ask the address. But you're keeping a bag here. I've seen you somewhere. - Why is he staring at me? Where? Aren't you the guy who was on CCTV? I'm not famous to appear on TV, brother. But I'll surely appear in near future. I'll make you famous, get into the vehicle. I'll take you to the place, you deserve to reach. Sit down. - Super, brother. You're done! Welcome! Accused Anbu! You've done a murder and tried to erase the evidence. Looks like he's in mood. - It was my mistake, sir. Is it murder case or rape case? Murder...rape? Or else rape and murder, both? - Sir! Did you do it alone or as a gang? Sir, my friends are in no way connected to this. It was all my mistake. I ruined my life on my own, sir. Do you know my daughter got many proposals from big families? All were doctors, software company owners. And big businessmen! But she rejected all of them and selected a man like you who don't have an address. She loved you! If you really want my daughter, would have you done this? Not like that, sir. Did you heed when I asked you to marry my daughter? Last night, we received a complaint that a girl missing. When we checked her phone call history, The last call was made to your phone number. I went to your house suspecting you. As I suspected, I found the girl's saree and watch in your home. So I decided, you had a connection with the missing girl. At that time, Momo gave me a clue. On checking her complete call history, She used to regularly talk to a guy called as James. I found that he's the guy who lives next to your house. When I inquired with him, He and the missing girl met in Facebook and fell in love with each other. He tried to misbehave with her in the absence of his parents. But the girl died due to fits. When he doesn't know what to do. You guys were inebriated and were flat. Using it, he dumped the corpse in your place and escaped. Sorry, brother! You booze heavily and unaware of what's going on and where are you lying? And don't know whether you're alive or dead. Why do you need marriage or funeral? Ask him like that, sir. How many plans you made to erase the evidence of a murder you didn't commit? How can I trust that you won't kill my daughter and dispose her corpse? Sir, I made a mistake. Okay. Police station? Have they got surrendered? Why the idol is here? Already stuck with murder case, now this too! Lord Muruga! I mustn't see you again in my daughter's life. Just vanish without any trace. Both engagement and marriage are cancelled. Get lost. I can go home now, thank God. What's this? It was in car. In car? Oh, my God! What's this? He's kissing him instead of his daughter. Would he send him alone for the first night or else he will. Commissioner sir! - Tell me. By taking heavy risk and after spilling the blood. I found the idol, sir. Excellent Rajamanickam! I'm proud of you.- Thank you, sir. Thank you... Thank you so much, sir. You love me sincerely, right? Will you wait for me for years? I'll wait. I'll wait with my husband and children. With husband and children? I'll wait for 10 minutes, if you don't come, I'll keep moving on. You will always have a second choice! Hold it. You mad. Don't know what happened! Anbu, did your father-in-law let you free, since you're his future son-in-law? No. Saturday and Sunday... Did he ask you to offer oil and sesame to temple? Can't you ever be serious? It seems Jaganmohan Reddy has ordered to close the police stations. Has Jaganmohan Reddy ordered? Jaganmohan Reddy is Andhra CM, right? Then, do we've to lodge complaint on Monday only? - Yes. How come the law of Andhra be applicable here? We can't bring liquor from Andhra here, how can their laws be applicable here? What did I say now to laugh out loud? Hey, we didn't commit this murder. Yes. Stop it. After hugging, he would've called the Commissioner. What would've he told the Commissioner? He would've told he shed blood to find that idol. That's all, isn't it? How can you get it right? As if you had seen it. This is a scene from film'Thunive Thunai'. Don...Don... - Who is he? Why are you standing here? Where is the bag? Are we going to temple or not? What happened? Tell me. Ask him, he'll tell you. Tell him. Come here. The world knows the story, how can you be unaware of it? Were we roaming with a corpse so far? Let him get normal, come. Come. Musical line from the film, "Jeyam". What did you do with Pandi? I folded him and dumped into boot. Is he still in boot? That's why, I'm getting moaning sound. You must do all work after marriage.

"We roam with great pride, don't know if it is right or wrong" "There are no laws beyond friendship for us" "Don't ask passport for flying rockets" "We life as life... Like and share is routine" "Charmed by the fragrance of fresh blossoms on your body..." "She stole my heart with her chocolaty eyes..." "She's unsettling me with her tequila like intoxication..."
