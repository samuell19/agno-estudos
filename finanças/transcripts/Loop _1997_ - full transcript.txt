(jazz music) (telephone ringing) (keyboard clacking) - [Rachel] Hello, this is The Illustrated Potter, please leave a message after the tone. (jazz music) (sirens wailing) (telephone ringing) - [Doctor] Well Rachel, the results are positive. You're six weeks' pregnant. (jazz music) (Bill grunting and yelling) (Jean shrieking) (jazz music) (Bill grunting) (jazz music) (Bill grunting) (jazz music) (Bill grunting) (jazz music) (Bill grunting) (blender whirring) (Jean moaning) (jazz music) (Bill grunts) (Bill sighs) (jazz music) - [Bill] Rachel! Close your eyes! - What is it? - Turn around. Go on then. Are your eyes closed? - What are you doing? - Sh, shut up. Close your eyes. Are you ready for this? - What are you doing? ♪ Happy anniversary - Oh Bill, oh, they're beautiful! Mm. (jazz music) You remembered. - Course I remembered. Do it to me, do it to me, that's it! (Bill groans) (Rachel shrieks) God, I love Bolly. - I hate when you do that! - Ah, I fucking love it, babes, I love this life. (jazz music) (high-pitched tones resound) - I've got something really special to give you this year. Before I do, Bill, I just want to say that, you and me, we're almost like a family, aren't we? I mean, your family all dead, and I hardly ever see mine. - [Bill] It's not my fault they don't like me. - [Rachel] That's not the reason I don't see them. You know that. - Who says I like them? Families, who needs 'em? - Everybody needs them, darling, one way or another. Look at us, we made this home together. - You made it, Rachel. - I made it for us. And here we are. We've been together three years. - Three years. - [Rachel] A long time. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What is it? (Bill sighs) - I'm sorry. Rachel, I'm leaving. I can't stand this any longer. You haven't changed, you've got stuck, and you bore me. - Who are you fucking? - Who ain't I fucking? (telephone ringing) Yeah, course it's me. (clattering) Hang on. Rachel, will you come back here? Can we finish this! What? No, of course it's right. I had information, didn't I? Is my cut through? Yeah, cash, sweet. Huh? You paid it into my fucking bank account? Who are you, the missing fucking link, you gimp? No, I'LL call you, right, I'll call you. Listen, are you deaf, I'll call you. Rachel, I'm tryin' to do this properly! I'll be round at Jason's. I'll send him over in the morning to pick up the rest of my gear. Clean break's best. (sirens wailing) I'm leaving now. (engine rumbling) (jazz music) (static buzzes) - Landing party to Enterprise, beam us up, Scotty. (whirring) Landing party to Enterprise, beam us up, Scotty. (whirring) - [Bill] Oh, caramba. Sorry, mate, just farted. - Just, yeah, right. You've been doing it all night, Bill. - You're bed's too soft Jason, it's shite. You wanna get yourself a futon, this is bad for your back. Or better still, you wanna lie on the floor. Is that pure juice? - [Jason] Mm-hm. - You sure? Jaffa? - I'm late, yeah, course it is. - Hey boy, what time is it? - I'll go on my way. Look, Bill. - What? - Well, it's a bit awkward, but I should be getting to work today. - Well they aren't gonna miss you, are they? Jason, you're a pen-pusher, you're notice below, you're scum, call in sick, take the day off. Come on, I'm a free man. I really appreciate this. (keys jingle) Now remember, you are the only person in the world I trust to drive it, so don't prang it or I'll have to pull out all your toenails. - You know I'll take care of it. - Make sure you stick it back in the garage when you're done, yeah? Come back up here, we can still go on Friday. - Oh, now come on, mate, not again. Well you repeat all the lines the whole time. - Get stuffed, go on, fuck off, run along, choppy-chop. Oi, Jason, you're my best mate, you know that? Do you know what that means? It means I love you, geezer. - Yeah, right, piss off. (Bill coos like a pigeon) (soft music) (phone beeps) (answer phone beeps) - Hello, this is Jack. Sorry I'm not free, but then again, who is? (answer phone beeps) - Hello, Jack! Where are you, hello, hello? (bar patrons chatting) - Same again, man. - Are you sure you want another one, Jack? Don't you think you've had enough for one morning? Get yourself some daylight, son. You know what people are saying. - I'm not a drunk. (bar patron laughs) I'm a useless, no good, no-hope waster, but I'm not a fuckin' drunk. Fill the glass okay? Come on. (bar patrons chatting) - You didn't tell me Jason was here. Where's Bill? Hi, Jason. - Hi Jenny. I didn't realize you were here. - So what's new then, Jase? Where were you on Saturday? Have you got some mystery woman you're keeping locked away? - No, I was visiting my family, Jenny. Look, Rachel, I think I just need to speak to you. Can we just have a little talk please? - You're not holding out on us, are you? Yeah, it's the quiet guys you've got to watch, hey Rache? - No, I just went home. - Yeah, yeah, that's what they all say; I need the bathroom. Don't go away. (jazz music) (door latch clicks) (flushing toilet splashes) What're you doing? - I'm leaving. - Oh, yeah. Why? Jesus, Rachel, you're just walking out? What about Bill? Jesus Rachel, sorry, I'm out of here. Jesus, your best bloody friend Jason! You're sick, both of you! - [Rachel] Damn! - What's wrong? - I can't get hold of Jack, he's never at home. - Well why don't you try Yellow Pages under pubs? - He's never at home when I need him. - Look, Rachel. Bill's gone. - [Rachel] So? - So, I love you, Rachel. - What? - I love you. I've always loved you, okay? - No. - Now you know that I'm in love with you. - No, no. - Don't say you haven't seen it, because you have. - No. - You have, 'cause you're single suddenly and I'm single, and this is-- - No! - a sign. - No! You're free and I'm free-- - No! - And I'm-- (sirens wailing) (Rachel moans unhappily) - No! (jazz music) (sirens wailing) - [Jason] What are you doing? - I'm leaving. - [Jason] Where are you gonna go? - (sighs) I need a car. - Well, I'll drive you. No, come on, come on, wherever you wanna go. - Okay, Jason. You say you love me, I'll cure you. Drive me to Norfolk, let's go. - In Bill's car? (jazz music) (horns honking) - [Rachel] Woo, that was close. - [Jason] Bill's gonna kill me, Rachel. I really shouldn't be doing this. - [Rachel] Oh stop worrying Jason, you're safe with me. - [Jason] Have you ever driven this car before, Rachel? I can't get it in third, it won't seem to go in third gear. - [Rachel] Pull over at the bank, will you? (light music) I need to get some cash. (light music) - [Bill] My cut come through? Cash, yeah? You paid it to my fucking bank account? Who are you, the missing fucking link, you gimp? (jazz music) - Jesus, who would have thought of it, Rachel and Jason? - How long's he been wedgin' my woman? - Weeks, oh you must feel terrible, Bill. - I'm gonna kill him. But first I'm gonna to kill her. No, no, I'm gonna to kill him first, then her, bitch. - Oh, she's a Gemini, Bill, I warned you. - Don't fuck with the right side of my brain, Jenny! (Bill breathes heavily) I'm getting a little bit tetchy, I'd better calm down. (Bill breathes sharply) Yeah, breathe, good. Heal me. Hold me, hold me. Yeah, mm. Where have they gone? - I don't know. - I think you do, 'cause you're doin' that funny thing with you eyes, now where have they gone? - I don't know. - Listen, Jenny, you're gonna look very silly trying to do touch therapy with no fucking fingers. Now where have they gone? - I don't know! (jazz music) - I don't think I was ever in love with him. He was great in bed. Wild, an animal. He liberated me. - He treated you like shit, Rachel. - Sometimes. - I don't believe it. You're still in love with him. - No. Before, I was his princess, he adored me. Now it's over. - So now I suppose you're free to go with Jack. - Jack? He's my best friend, you fool! - Oh, come on. There's always been something between you. Everyone knows that, Rachel. - What kind of service do they call this? Order for me, will you, if anyone comes? (patrons chatting faintly) (man in blue tutting) - Love's an illusion, son. Fades like the dawn mist on a river. I should know, I'm an angler. - Excuse me, but I don't think it's any of your business, okay? You don't know anything, so just mind you own business. - He's right, though, love. You look like a dog in the rain. It's a sickness. - Two coffees, two rounds of toast: one white, one brown. One marmalade, one, I don't know, raspberry jam, thank you. - Out of control, aren't you, son? Forgotten who you are. - You don't know what it's like. - We've all been there, love. - You don't know what I'm going through. I've never been in love before. - You should listen to a woman like that, son. A real woman, not some young flibbertigibbet. - You're not listening to me. - We're here, love, we're here. - What's up with him? - What does it look like? Poor lamb. If he was in love with me, I wouldn't treat him the way you do. All most of us want is a bit of affection. I suppose you think you're special. You think you deserve more. - Jason, we're leaving, now. - [Waitress] Well, it'll pass, he just needs faith. - Oh aye, and little bit of skepticism wouldn't go amiss, either. - Oh, you've been through it then? - Oh aye, I'm from Newcastle. - There's plenty more fish in the sea. - Very true, I've seen them. Fancy a drink after, pet? (upbeat hip hop music) - [Clerk] You swear no one's gonna get hurt this time, yeah? - I don't hurt people, for fuck's sake, I've changed. - All right, well don't tell anyone I did this. Ah, got a new switch. Forecress's Filling Station today, 22 pound 50 petrol, two pounds 64, 20 Camels. - Yes, that is her, that is her, the bitch! He doesn't smoke, he's a fucking wimp. - 20 pence Diet Coke, 40 pence ginger beer? - Yeah, all right. - We-ven-kiss-kiss. Four crosses, really, 26 pence for a Mars bar. Uh, it's um, Bedfordshire. - Bedfordshdire? - Yeah. - Bedfordshdire, Bedfordshdire. What's it, oh, that's on the way to... She's takin' him to see her family. Oh, no, no, she hates her family, she ain't seen them in years. She never took me to see her family, huh. Well no, there was one time. - Sorry I can't do anything about these charges, mate. - She hates 'em! Well she told me she hated 'em. What charges? - Well her, look. Three pound 50 a day, starting today. Somebody cleared the account. - Go back with this thing. - Ah, hey, hey. All right, all right, all right, ah. Yes, ah, look, withdrawal. 36,121 pounds, 36 pence. Cash, cleared the account. You owe me one, Bill. - What? - [Clerk] Uh, I said um-- - What'd you say? - Nothing. - What did you say? - No, nothing. Nothing. - Hmm? - Nothing, I said, (gasps). - You fucking muppet! - No, I just... (smooching) - Do you want the boys in the city to know that you take it up the Garry Glitter? I don't owe anyone anything, all right? Yes Bill, that's right, Bill. (engine rumbling) - [Rachel] Pull over, Jason, I got to do a wee. - [Jason] All right, okay. (birds twittering) (soft music) (birds twittering) - [Hannah] I've told you, she doesn't want to see you. Keep away from her, she could have a relapse. I won't allow that. (orchestral music) (CD player clicks) (speaking faintly on TV) (audience laughing) It's bedtime, Sam. - I don't wanna go to bed. - [Hannah] We had a deal, Sam, come on. - I want to sleep in Grandad's caravan. - [Hannah] Sam, I'm tired, don't be childish. - I can't help it, I am a child. - Go on up, Sweet-Pea. And don't forget to brush your teeth. - [Sam] I won't, I promise. Say goodnight to Grandma for me. - You smell of flowers. - Do you need anything? - And potatoes. - I can't get you anything? - I don't need anything. Have you seen your father today? - (scoffs) He's working on that stupid boat. - Has he, he hasn't been trying to see me? - [Hannah] No. - Good. I'm glad. (old-fashioned jazz music) (birds twittering) - You sure about this? - Yes. - Well, look, all I'm trying to say is, is this a good time? We could always, we could always find a B and B and come back in the morning. You know, they say, emotion's much more naked at night. - Don't be so melodramatic, Jason, she's only my sister. (knocking at door) - Hannah. - Rachel! (slap resounds) (Rachel screams) - Hey, come on, you can't do that-- (slap resounds) Ow! - Keep out of this, Jason, this is family. - This has nothing to do with you, whoever you are. - You can make us some coffee, make us some coffee, Jason. - It's in the kitchen. Come on. - You never phone, you don't write, you don't visit, nothing, we never hear from you. God, you're so selfish. - Well, I'm here now. Go away for a couple of days, I don't know, take Sam. Have a break; I've got money. - I don't want your money. (scoffs) Don't make me laugh. Anyway, you wouldn't have a clue. You don't know what Mum needs. - Tell me, then. I want to spend some time with her. - I want, I want. Oh, you're so selfish. You haven't changed a bit. You couldn't begin to imagine her demands. - Don't blame Olivia for your unhappiness. - Don't call her Olivia. She's our mother, Rachel. - It's your life, Hannah. - You'd be happy to put her away somewhere, wouldn't you? It wouldn't bother you a bit. Someone's got to look after her, Rachel. - Look, Hanney, I just want to stay a couple of days. You've every right to kick me out. - Don't be stupid. This is still your room, it always will be. - Jason will need his own. - I can see that. I'll get the sheets; you know where the spare room is. - Hanney. - Don't touch me, Rachel. Just don't touch me. (soft music) (Bill groans) (Bill shouts) - I'm so scared, Jack; something terrible's gonna happen. I shouldn't have told him, oh God, it's all my fault. - No, it's not, Jenny. - Yes, it is. If I hadn't have told him he might not have known. He's completely lost it, he's gone wild. He's like he was before, Jack. Oh, God, it's all my fault. - Maybe it is, then. - Well, thanks a lot, Jack, some good friend you are! Don't shoot the messenger. Look, are you gonna do something about it or not? - No I'm not. - I thought I thought you, you know. Well you and Rachel... - Me and Rachel? - Yeah, Rachel and you. - Me and Rachel? Jenny, she's my friend, ever since I came over here when I was 14. I'm like her brother. I'm her best friend, man. - Call yourself a friend? Jesus, Jack, what kind of a friend are you? (scoffs) - Look, I can't... I think I know where she might have gone, right. But I can't, fuck. - [Jenny] Why not? - I can't tell you. - She needs your help, Jack, please. He's gonna do something awful. (bar patrons speak faintly) - Oh man. (jazz music) - [Man On PA Good Morning, this is the 6:15 from Liverpool Street to King's Lynn, calling at Bishop's Stortford, Saffron Walden, Ely and Downham Market. Due to signal failure, this train will not be calling at Melksham, thank you. - [Jason] Ow. - [Sam] No smoking. - Yeah. Sorry. You're right, it's a disgusting habit - It's not just your health. You should think about other people too. - Yeah, I agree. Are you Sam? - Yes. - So you're Sam. - Yes, who are you? - Sorry. I'm Jason. I came last night with your mum's sister. - Aunt Rachel? - Yeah. She's a wonderful woman, isn't she? - Are you the stupid one? - Me? No, that... Well, maybe I am. What are you drawing? Whoa, modern art, right? Can never understand it myself. - My father was a painter. - Yeah. You know, you've got your father's eyes. Different color but, the same. - Do you know my father? - Yeah. - What's he like? - Well, he's very special. - I thought so. - Don't think I'm envious, or anything like that, 'cause I'm not, but... Well, he was given it all on a plate. Some of us weren't given a lot. Jack was blessed by the gods. - I knew he was. - Hello. - Oh, hiya. - Mum? - There you are, Sam. Can you take Grandma her breakfast? - She'll try and make me stay and talk. She's so boring. - Sam, don't talk about your grandmother like that. Especially in front of strangers. - He's not a stranger, he knows my father. - Sam, I thought we had a deal, come on. That's it. (groans) (door latch clicks) What are you doin'? Did I say you could smoke in my house? Have you started my sister smoking again? - Me? No, quite the opposite. - No, I don't imagine you have. (birds twittering) It's pretty obvious what's wrong with you. Can I give you some advice? Forget my sister, don't waste your time. You're only making a fool of yourself. She likes strong men, dangerous men, wild men, rogues. She always has, even when she was a girl. She thinks she's liberated, but the men she chooses-- - Maybe that's been her mistake, choosing the wrong man. Making a fool of herself. - Hey, that's my sister you're talking about, remember. - Maybe I'm the right man for her. Have you ever thought of that? Maybe, maybe I'm one who can make her happy. - You? How could you make her happy? - By letting her be herself. - That's up to her; don't kid yourself. She'll still want a strong man, those things don't change. - You're an expert, right? - I'm her sister, I know her. Anyway, it's common sense, which your infatuation's clearly robbed you of. - There's no need to insult me. You don't even know me. Pity me, but don't insult me, Hannah. - I'm trying to cure you. (soft music) - Breakfast, Rachel. (birds twittering) Who's that man? - [Rachel] What man? - [Jason] Just came out of the caravan over there Stealing flowers. - Oh, that'll be Daddy. - Well, why does he steal them? What's he doing in the caravan? - He lives there. - (scoffs) What, in a caravan, why? - [Rachel] He moved in after Mother threw him out. - When? - Oh, ages ago, after the accident. - Accident, what accident? - Mother and the combine harvester. - Combine harvester? - He was reaping, she took his dinner out to the field. It was dusk, she was wearing a corn-colored dress. Mother always wore beautiful dresses, even when she was mucking out the pigs. Anyway, he didn't see her. The dress caught, and the rest is history. - What, she was mangled in the blades? - No, the wheels, stupid. She was just tossed around a bit. These things happen on farms. Anyway, knowing Mother she'll probably never walk again. - God, how tragic. - Oh, the accident's just an excuse. What she really blames him for is having children, abandoning her musical career, becoming a farmer's wife. She couldn't stand it. - How sad. She hates him. - [Rachel] Oh she desperately wants him back. But she's far too proud to admit it. So she makes Hannah keep him away. - That's terrible. - So she hates Hannah, I'm the one she loves. But Daddy, he loves Hannah. - That's insane, Rachel. - It's family, Jason. Don't you come from a family? - Well, yeah, but we're, well, nice to each other. - [Sam] Come on, Granddad, the coast is clear. - [Tom] Wish me luck, sweetheart. (jazz music) (birds calling) - Don't even think about it. - We'll manage one day, Grandad; don't worry about Mum. If I had a father, I wouldn't speak to him like that. - Thanks, sweetheart. (electronica music) (Bill exhales heavily) (Bill yelling) - [Bill] Woo, woo! Mm! Mm! Mm! (horns honking) Sorry. Here you go. (sirens wailing) - Morning, geezer. - Good morning, sir. - I, uh, wanna hire a powerful car. - Certainly, sir. I'll just need to see your driving license. - Hmm. Left it in the fucking glove compartment. - I beg your pardon? - It's all right, mate, I can remember my Driver's Number. - No can do, sir, sorry, have to see it. - I don't, I haven't, I don't have it with me. - I'm sorry, sir, nothing I can do. - Just say you saw it, eh? Go on, give the kids a treat, eh? - I beg your pardon, sir. You're not hiring a car at some Third World airport. This is the United Kingdom. (horns honking) No, uh, previous convictions? (groans) - You took the bribe, fuck-face, don't get superior with me. Which eyeball do you like best, hmm? That one, or that one? Only joking. Now how about that powerful car, eh? (engine rumbling) (electronica music) (jazz music) (birds twittering) (knocking at door) - Mother. - Rachel! - [Rachel] I'm home. - Oh Rachel, my darling! (Olivia exclaiming) (Rachel exclaims) Oh, oh! (Olivia groans) - There, there, there. - Oh. Let me look at you. - Mother, listen to me. I'm going to have a baby. - A baby? Oh my God, how awful for you. You'll have to get rid of it. - Mother, for God's sake. - Don't let it get in the way of your life, Rachel. Don't do what I did. - You're playing the same old tune. - I gave up everything when I had your sister: my music, my career, everything, I gave it up for her. And for you, and for him. I had to, he made me. - It was your choice too, face up to it. Take responsibility, Mother. And now it's my choice. - But it's a terrible choice, Rachel. No one can imagine what it is to have a baby. Nobody knows the burden, not till it happens to you. Hannah has been my burden from the day she was born. - You have to let Hannah go, Mother, it's time. It's time for her to have a life. - Oh I've tried, darling, believe me, I've tried. But she clings to me, she won't let me go. I'd be in a home if she'd let me. What have I got to live for here? - You have to tell Hannah you love her. - I can't! I don't, she spoiled everything. (birds twittering) (jazz music) - So Bill left you? He was a creep, like all men. - No, Hannah. - They're all the same, Rachel, they're like little boys. - Hanney? I'm pregnant. (Hannah sighs and laughs) - Oh! (laughing) Oh. And you're supposed to be the clever one. - Hannah? - Do you have any idea what it's like bringing a child up on your own? It's painful. They give you no help, nothing, he just ran out. - But you made him stay away! Things could have been different. Can't you forgive Jack after all this time? - Forgive him? Why should I forgive him? He left me, Rachel. - [Rachel] But he didn't know about Sam. - Oh, it wouldn't have made any difference. (jazz music) - Yeah. Yeah, I know who you mean, I'm going very close. I don't know them. She grows flowers on that old farm. Is she your sweetheart? - No, no, I used to live around here. - [Sarah] So what do you do now? - I'm a, I work in an art gallery. - An art gallery? There was a guy from round here, he was a painter. He was famous, really young. Had his first exhibition in London. Some rich man bought every single piece. I don't know what happened to him. - Neither do I. (melancholy music) You can drop me off here. - [Sarah] Okay. - [Jack] Thanks for the lift. (birds twittering) (bell jingles) - Anyone home? Hi there, remember me? - [Sam] I think so, you're Aunt Rachel. - Are you going to invite me up? - Women aren't allowed up here. - [Rachel] Why not? - I don't know, they cause trouble. - [Rachel] Really? - Grandad doesn't let them on his boat. - Well, I may be a woman, but I used to be a pirate. And if you don't invite me up, I might have to come up and storm your citadel. Ransack, burn and pillage. Is that really what you want? You've got lots of Jack's paintings up here. Wow, that one of me was the last one he did before he left. - I thought that was Mummy. - Yes, perhaps it is. Pretty cool place you've got here. - I can see everything from up here. - You've probably seen too much. It's all tangled up down there, isn't it? - You know, it's not just women who aren't allowed up here. - Really? - Men aren't, either, they cause trouble too. - Only children and pirates, eh? - Just one child, and one pirate. I made a special exception for you. - I'm honored. (horns honking) (upbeat music) (birds cawing) - You know, a mate of mine once said to me, when you taste the sweet fruits of love, always remember, you get stuck with the rancid pips between your teeth. That's what it's like with Rachel. My saying is, right, always peel your own banana, and then if you slip up on the skin, you're a tosser. You know, Rachel, she's an artist, she paints pottery and stuff. Modern artist, loves Picasso. (sighs) That's life, innit? You see, she always banged on about equality. I used to say to her, babes, can't you see equality equals economic failure? I mean, it's obvious, isn't it? There's more birds working now than ever, right? Birth rates collapse, divorce goes up. Families collapse, crime goes up, everyone's poorer. But she don't understand, does she, she's an artist. No, she's goes no, no, no no, she's, uh, totally fucked up. She's got her own business, mind, she makes good money. It's a fucking joke. Not boring you, am I? - Oh no, no, no, it's good to talk, innit? - I can't decide whether I love her or or I hate her. She's just always been there. - Do you want me to check the oil? - Yeah. (jazz music) - Hey. Can I help at all? - Do you know anything about flowers? - Yeah, sure, I've bought plenty of flowers before. - Hmm, what do you know? - Well, I'm not, I mean I'm not saying I know the specifics or anything like that. - So how can you help? - Have you got anything heavy that needs carrying? Oh, no, I'm sure you're strong enough, I didn't mean that. I just thought-- - No, look, it's nice of you. You can help, yes, there's a pile of manure by the house. There's a spade and a wheelbarrow. You can mulch the roses. - Mulch? (soft music) (knocking at window) Hi. - I know what you want. - I'm not denying anything. You're right, I'm in love with her. - Hmm. - [Jason] What does she want? - She just wants to grow flowers. - No, not Hannah. (scoffs) Rachel, I mean, what does she want? - Don't you play games with me, young man. - No, I wouldn't, I don't know how to play games. - [Olivia] I've seen the way you look at her. Well she's not for you. - I've always been in love with her. - Keep your hands off her, do you hear me? She's safe here. She needs looking after, protecting from men like you. I've seen your kind before. Weak men, you're dangerous. (laughs) I know, I know. Go on then, off you go. (birds cawing) - Do you know, you're the first woman ever to set foot on this boat, Rachel. I wanted Olivia to be the first one on it; she'd never come. So instead of being our pleasure cruiser, it's my bolt-hole, my refuge. - Lonely man. - I didn't say I was lonely; we all need affection. - Dad, go to her. Why don't you just go to her? - I've tried, Rachel, I've tried. She won't see me, she makes Hannah keep me away. - You let Mother blame you, she's lost respect for you. You've got to win her back, you've got to be strong. Be strong, Daddy. (slow piano music) It's time to talk, Mother. (Olivia gasps) - What's he doing here? Get out of here! - Stop it, Mother. - Let's go, Rachel. - No! - What the hell do you think you're doing here? Get out! - Hannah. - Oh, Mummy, calm down, it's okay, I'm here. - They're bullying me. Don't let them do this to me, Hannah! - We've got to sort it out! - I'm going to have an attack! - Oh, look what you've done, get out! Do you want to kill her now? - Let's go! - No! We're not leaving till we've sorted it out! - She's pretending, stop pretending, Grandma! - Don't you tell me what to do, young lady! - Shut up, Sam! - Olivia, my darling-- - Go away! - I can't breathe! - Stop it, Grandma, stop it! (all clamoring) (slow piano music) - Jack! - All right, Rache. Oh. - You used to protect me from Hannah. - Are you kidding? It was the other way around, I used to protect her from you. - So who was protecting you? - I didn't need anything from anybody, did I? - Are you going to see her? - Yeah, I could. I'm just trying to get my head around it, though. - Jack, don't be a coward, face her. - Hannah doesn't wanna see me, Rache, she'll erupt. - I think Sam wants to see you. - (sighs) Yeah. Yeah. (engine rumbling) (ice cream truck music) (horn honking) ("Old MacDonald Had a Farm") - [Bill] Get out of the fucking way, you gimp! (horn honking) Fucking move on, deaf bastard! - [Operator] Directory inquiries, which name? - Westman. - [Operator] Which town? - Uh, well it's not in town, it's in the country, near here. - [Operator] Near where, sir? - Here, near Norwich. - [Operator] Westman, Hannah, Market Gardener? - Yeah, that's it, yeah, where's she live? - [Operator] Thank you. - Yes, thank you, where does she live? - [Operator] The number you require is-- - I don't want the fucking number! I want the address, you slag. - [Operator] Three six, I repeat, the number you require is. (slap resounds) - I wish I'd never told her anything about you. I should have said you were dead. She fantasizes about you, I know she does. She's built up this picture of you even though she doesn't know you. She used to ask all the time when you were gonna call. She only stopped when she was old enough to see how it annoyed me. - That's what you wanted, you told me to keep away. - You left me, you bastard. The older she gets, the harder it gets. I am exhausted, Jack, I'm dying of loneliness. (gasps) Don't touch me, Jack, I don't want your pity! - It's not pity. Fuck it, Hannah, it's been downhill for me ever since I left. - That's not my fault. - I just had to be free. - Free? Oh, bully for you. - Freedom, it seems obvious to all. Yet there's nothing more obscure, more ambiguous, more abused. - Cut that nonsense out! - Okay, Hannah. (soft music) - Oh, Jack. We had everything. We had it all. You bastard. (light music) (telephone ringing) - [Bill] Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello, Westman Nursery. - [Bill] Do you sell flowers? - Yes, do you want to order some? - Yeah, yeah, I want to order a bunch of red roses. - My mum only sells wholesale. - Okay, I wanna buy a lorry load of red roses. - [Sam] What name? - Mr., Mr. Smith. - [Sam] Where do you want them delivered? - Did I say anything about delivery? I'll come and pick them up myself. Where do you live? - Westman Nursery, the Row, near Melksham. - Good boy. - I'm not a boy. - Oh, my sincerest sympathies. (soft music) (moaning) Rachel! (dog barking) Rachel! (Bill yelling) - Come in. Sam! - Yeah? - Could you come down, please? - [Sam] Okay, some weirdo was on the phone, Mum. (chickens clucking) (birds twittering) - Sam, do you know who this is? This is your father, Sam. Do you want to say hello? (punches resounding) (Sam grunts) (chicken clucks) (soft music) - The thing is, apparently he's back in his old violent mood again. - What, he wants to hurt Rachel? - If he lays one finger on my sister I'll kill him. - I've got a feeling it's you he's more interested in, Jason. - Me? - (sighs) Thank God for that. - You'd best get going then. - If Jason's not here, Bill's more likely to go for Rachel. - That's true, maybe he'd better stay. - Like a decoy? - (scoffs) Like a decoy? - Listen, Hannah, you stick with Rachel, and I'll keep with Jason, just in case. - No, Jason's helping me with my roses, Jack. You look after Rachel. - Where is she? - I don't know. (slow piano music) - Any sign of her? - No. Is it true you drink lots of whisky? - [Jack] Drinking's not that bad for you, you know, Sam. It only destroys two of the body's functions. It messes up the liver pretty badly. - [Sam] What's the other one? - I can't remember . Do you know about color, Sam? Do you know that it's not really real? That the sky isn't really blue, or the grass green? It's purely the way our eyes see light reflected. We've got these photo-sensitive cells, right, in the cones of our retina, seven million of them! - Will you teach me to draw? - Of course. And you can teach me. You're at the perfect age. (tires squealing) (birds twittering) - Oi, turnip head! Make any difference which way I go to Melksham? - What? - I said, does it make any difference which way I go to Melksham? - What? - Does it make any difference which way I go to Melksham? - [Farmer] What? - Are you takin' the piss? Does it make any difference which way I go to Melksham? - It don't make no difference to me, boy. - He must be close by now. I can feel him. (sprinkler whirring) - Jason, stop worrying. You're safe with me. Relax. We'll go for a swim. (engine rumbling) - [Bill] Start, you bastard. (birds twittering) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful piano music) (birds twittering) - [Hannah] Come on, come on in, it's beautiful! Come on! Woo! (Hannah speaks faintly) (ominous music) Woo, this will wake you up. - [Jack] I'll wake up. (Hannah exclaiming happily) Oh. - Oh! (jazz music) Come on, ooh, let's dry off. What the hell's this? - He's here. It's Bill's. (Bill yelling) (Hannah screams) - [Bill] Jason! You fucking bastard! You fucking bastard! (Hannah screaming) I hate you! - Sh. Listen. - What? (Bill shouting faintly) - OH, Jason, look into my eyes, look at me, look at me! I want the last thing you see to be the eyes of the devil! 'Cause I am taking you to hell, I am Satan! - Get off him, get off! - See my eyes! (Hannah screaming) You bastard!, I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna choke the living-- - Get off! - Fucking, I'll have you, you bastard! Look at Beelzebub! (blow thudding) (birds twittering) - Who's there? You! Who let you in? - I did. - Where's Hannah? - I don't know. - Hannah! Get out! I'll shout. I'll scream! - Not this time you won't. - [Olivia] How dare you, Tom Westman, put me down! Put me down at once! (blows thudding) How dare you behave like this, treating me like a sack of potatoes, put me down! (jazz music) (birds twittering) - Yeah, he's still breathin'. - I can feel his pulse. - You were brilliant, Dad. - You're a hero after all, Jack. Can you take Grandma her cup of tea, Sam? - Jack, I love you, man. - Bill, Bill. - Rachel, what are you doin' here? - Mum, Mum, Grandma's gone! - [Rachel and Hannah] Gone? - Jason, sorry, mate. (old-fashioned jazz music) - [Jack] Is it a Mohawk? - Pass me the purple. This one. - [Jack] Ah, it's a multicolored haircut. Listen, what are these, are these corn circles? - [Sam] Could be. - We put Bill in your mother's room. - He can't walk. - [Jack] He'll be fine, I just hit him a bit too hard. - Someone had to. - Go and see him, Rachel. - I don't want to. - Rachel, finish it. - Bill? - What? - You're a bastard. - I know. - I hate you. - You should do. - You're cruel and heartless. - That's true. I'm sorry, Rachel. - You're supposed to fight back. - I'm sorry, Rachel. - About the money, I'll get it. - I don't need money. It's yours. You'll need it now. - How do you know? I'll get the car keys. - I don't need a car. - Don't be crazy. - You have it, Rachel. - You've changed, Bill. - It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the rights and limits of the others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation. - That's all very fine and true. - Yeah. It was in this book by your mum's bed. - You're a child, Bill. - We're all children, Rachel. I can see it now. (whippoorwill calls) - [Rachel] What's going on, what are you doin'? - I've cleaned up in there, Rache. I'm gonna move back in. It's clear to me now, I've got to be with Sam. A man needs his child. I should be with them. - But that's not what Hannah wants. - I'm gonna prove myself to her. - But that's not what you want, Jack. - We'll get back together, the three of us. That's the answer. We loved each other once, we can rebuild that. - Oh Jack. (Hannah moans) - Who's there? Mm, Jason. What time is it? - It's late. - I must have dropped off. (sighs) Where's Rachel? - I don't know. - Come over here, Jason. What do you do, Jason? - Do? - For a living; I never asked. - I uh, I work for the council. I'm a pen-pusher, bureaucrat. - Really? How boring. - I work in the housing department. I find people the right place to live. - Do you like it? - It's easy. (scoffs) No. I hate it. - Do you like flowers? - Yeah. I love flowers. (slow piano music) (birds twittering) - How long have you been there? - I've been waiting, I want to show you something. (door creaks) (soft music) (birds twittering) - [Rachel] It's time for me to go. - You're going to take my Dad with you, aren't you? - [Rachel] Yes, Sam, I am. - I know, I want to say goodbye this time. - [Rachel] That's a good idea. - I only just said hello. (birds twittering) - [Rachel] Here, give this to your mother after we've gone. It's a present, okay, sweetheart? (slow piano music) (birds twittering) - Can I come and visit? - Of course you can. - Is that a deal? - That's a deal. I'll keep in touch this time, I promise. - Shake? - Shake. (zipper rasps) (Bill snoring faintly) (birds twittering) (sheep bleating) - [Jack] Give me the keys, Rache, I'm drivin'. - [Rachel] You don't drive. - [Jack] I'm driving. (keys jingle) (engine rumbling) - Oi! That's my car, you bastard! (jazz music) - [Rachel] When did you start driving again, Jack? - [Jack] This morning, Rache, this morning. - [Rachel] I've got some news for you. - [Jack] Really, what the hell's this? (sheep bleating) So what's this news then, Rachel, come on. - [Rachel] Okay, I'll give you a clue, it's pink. - [Jack] Candy floss, definitely. - [Rachel] No, (laughs) it takes nine months to make. - [Jack] Aha, really bad fucking whiskey. - [Rachel] (laughing) No. (jazz music) (Bill grunting) (Bill panting) (sheep bleating) - Get out of my way!
