Subtitlted By RaviKant What's so funny, dad? The roads are really bad! Tadkalal, are all the arrangements done? Can anything be amiss with me around? Uncle, they're here! But why are you so excited? Go and see if Muskaan is ready or not. They're very respectable people, so please behave courteously. Don't you worry, dad. I'll handle it! Many of your proposals were rejected.. ..so you must be having some experience! - What? Don't be funny! Hello, sir! - Hello. You've built a beautiful house! Beautiful. - l worked a little. The rest is god's mercy. He's my son Balwinder. - Billu. He's a bit! - Not a bit, but quite a lot. Come in. - Let's go! Yes. - Did you face any problem on the way? In a village where everyone knows you, how can there be problems? But the roads are really bad. The roads are bad but people are good. That's why we've come here. Will you have something? - Why not? Please. Good. You know why we've come here. - Yes, I do. Ujala, bring Muskaan here. Dad, you've got it! Dad, let's go back! A ghost! Muskaan, sit properly! Good sense of humour! lt's happening! She's beautiful! - Yes! My son likes your Muskaan. What's your opinion? Let me ask Muskaan. Did you like the hero? The question of my choice doesn't arise. Let them meet brother Vishal first. Hey, if Vishal comes, then the alliance will be fixed! There's Vishal. They've come with a proposal for Muskaan. - Yes. Hi! God help him! Cool! Relax! My name is Balwinder! People lovingly call me Billu! Billu, don't shake so much! He's wiggling! What's it? - Don't spoil things! What's the matter? - I can come here only if she goes! Uncle, may I show my future brother-in-Iaw my estate? Yes! - No. Vishal! Yes. - No! Yes. - I would like to see my in-laws place. No. - Let them go. They'lI Ieave as a pair but only one will return. Come on. - Yes! Let's go! "We're the world!" He'll face the music! - Music? Don't worry about that. There'lI be music in the wedding. l fear that he may face it right now! Slow. Slow! There's nothing to worry. Everything will be fine. That's not funny! By now, Billu and Vishal must've become fast friends. Don't go fast! - There's grass ahead! No! My Billu is such an expert in conversation.. ..that Vishal wilI become his fan! Why didn't they both return yet? Dad! Help me! I think they'll fix the marriage there itself. Horse, why did you drop me down? There they are! But I can't see my BiIlu anywhere! I had toId you that they'lI leave as a pair but only one wiIl return! Mummy! My dear, BilIu! What a ride! Dad, this brother-in-law is very bad! What? - No! Come on! He showed me around the estate thoroughly! From top to bottom, from the trees, from every angle! Let's go back! Hey! He's badly hurt! - God! If you didn't approve of my son, you could've just refused! He's nice. - Even l didn't know that he'd be in this state. Come. Let's go, Balwinder! Don't be funny! Billu. - Yes. The boy was a sample! I knew that I couldn't approve of him and neither would you. But why were you so offensive? He could've broken his Iimbs. Sorry, uncle. - Get going! You threw him out! Good! What's this? Okay, darling! Enjoy! I liked this for brother. How do you find it? It's fine. Anyway, you've to tie it. Don't be so haughty! Who knows, you might've to tie it to him someday. Shut up! Don't say so. Your love is incredible, indeed. Brother doesn't give you a damn, but you always dream of him! I too dream. But the difference is that I dream with open eyes. And l see only you in my dreams. I see. - Yes. Tell me, for how Iong wiIl your brother keep on rejecting alliances? Will he get you married or not? What to do? A suitable boy isn't to be found. I'm there! Tell your brother that you've chosen the boy! Tell him to come to my place with a proposal. Then things could fall in pIace! Why don't you tell him yourseIf? - l wouId've told him! But the moment your brother appears before me.. ..he becomes worried and tense. He begins to shake like a Ieaf! ls it? - Yes! Are you done? - Yes! Go home, dear? Shall I go home too? - Wait. Ok. If you behave like this again the next time.. ..then your head will be inside and your legs outside. He fixed me properly! Brother. Brother. - I'm here, dear. You're sitting here and I've been looking for you all over. Forget what's happened. Why bother about them. But I have to bother about you, dear. I can't toIerate anybody misbehaving with you. Forget it and have your meals. C'mon. You've cooked food? - Yes. It's deIicious. Brother. Wake up! Wake up! Please! - Let me sleep. Please wake up! - Why? Because it's my day today and only my orders wilI be obeyed! Get up. Oh yes! It's the festival today, isn't it? Had you forgotten? - How can I forget? I live for this day. Give me your hand. May god bestow you with all joys. Blessings alone won't suffice this year. I'm going to ask you for something special this year. - What? I want to go to Mumbai. - Why? Because I want to move with the times. I want to go to the city for higher studies. 'VishaI dear, treat Muskaan like a baby.' 'FuIfill every wish of hers.' 'Son, don't ever make her feel the Iack of parents.' 'As she has nobody else other than you.' Okay. Brother, thank you! You're great! "I love you all!" "Friends, I've no destination or a life partner!" "Yet, I've set out from home." "Maybe, the one I'm looking for.." "..is my Iife partner, my destination." "Hit it!" "O beloved, the crazy one looks for you." "You come in my dreams everyday, come into my life, beloved." "O beloved, the crazy one looks for you." "You come in my dreams everyday, come into my life, beloved." "My dream, the queen of my thoughts." "Our story will be made someday." "My dream, the queen of my thoughts." "Our story will be made someday." "It's in my lost senses that l've taken this oath." "One day, my love, l've to attain you in love." "You come in my dreams everyday, come into my life, beloved." "O beloved, the crazy one looks for you." "You come in my dreams everyday, come into my life, beloved." "She'Il be like a beautiful fairy." "I don't know how my beloved wilI be."

"You come in my dreams everyday, come into my life, beloved." "O beloved, the crazy one looks for you." "You come in my dreams everyday, come into my life, beloved." "Come into my life, beIoved." Brother! Brother! Cool it! Come on! - What's your problem? I'm so sorry. Can't you see? l can see, darling! That's why I banged into a hunk like you! Shall we go? Hi, baby! Please don't! - Sorry! Come. You want to study in this jungle? This isn't a jungle. It's the biggest colIege of the city. l can see. That's why there are more beasts than people here. That's the principal's office. Smile, please. Come on. Come in. Come. Ok. Good morning, sir. Good morning! Muskaan Thakur. Oh yes! Sir's niece! I was expecting you, dear. Here's your form, fill it. Thank you. Who's he? - He's my elder brother. Oh eIder brother! Why are you standing there, shouldering a burden? Lighten your burden and sit. ln my coIlege, we lay stress on the brains, not the shouIders. - Brains? Students sell their brains and come here! And you speak of laying stress on one's brains! Have this city's mills shut down.. ..that girls have stopped wearing clothes? Can't you see? - l can! Please sit. Girls adorn themseIves with jewellery, but here, the boys do! Can't you see? - I can. They smoke as if this isn't a college, but a cigarette factory! Can't you see even that? - Hey! I can see. Then why don't you do something? What can l do? This is the culture these days, elder brother. Culture? It was okay tiIl today, but it'll not do from tomorrow. Muskaan wilI come here to study. - Yes. Ok. Father's name, Vishal Thakur. Mother's name is Vishal Thakur too? Vishal is my eIder brother's name. I lost my parents in chiIdhood. He's the one who has raised me. He has forsaken his happiness for mine. Therefore my elder brother means everything to me. Ok. Understand? - Yes. Let's go. - One moment. I'd Iike to tell you something before you leave. Looking at your love, I remembered my sister today. Like you, even I used to Iove her a lot! Like you, I used to threaten people! I mean, I used to explain to people! But she fell in Iove with somebody else! She eIoped and got married to him! Are you done? Thank you, sir! Come on! Did I say something wrong? You shouldn't have spoken to him that way. You know, he's the principal of this college! Does he mean more to you than your brother? No. Nobody means more to me than my brother. If you ever need anything.. ..then there's no need to write to me or calI me up. Just think about me and l'll be here. Okay? - Okay. Don't! - l won't spare you! Where the hell are you running? Help! - I won't spare you! Wait! Suraj, pIease save me! Why are you thrashing the poor boy? - He hit me with an egg! Ouch! Come in front! You should be in the front or in the side! Why did you hit him with an egg? l wasn't hitting him, I was only ragging him! Indeed! One rags others and not your own people! And this is our final year in coIlege, understand? That's provided we pass! - Yes. What's the matter? Nothing. But something's definitely the matter. Look at me. Hi! Fool! She didn't even acknowledge you! Such humiliation! Really? lf I don't have her chasing me in 2 minutes, I'll be damned! Get Iost! Want to lay a bet? Do it! - How much? 500. - 50,000. 1,000. - Done. Done. All the worst! To you too! - Get lost! O god! - Get lost! 'Want to Iay a bet?' Hi! Hello! OnIy 5 seconds left for 2 minutes and there's no sign of Suraj! FooI! Stop looking at your watch and look ahead! Suraj's amazing! The money's lost! Why are you standing here? - Manoj! Hi! What're you doing? Give me money! - I'm just coming! Money! - Will I have to? Get down! - Yes! Let's go! Bye! Hey wrestler! - Get lost! Excuse me! Why did you call me to the library? What's it? lrrespective of what she thinks of me, I think very highly of her. Of whom? - Of her. Of whom? The girl with the bag. - Which girl? The one whom I was running ahead of. l see! But we thought that she was running behind you! It's one and the same! Explain to me later! I just can't understand anything! I'll do that if you Iook at me! There was a bag exactly like this. I picked the bag and.. Hello! Hi. WeIl, I was expIaining to her that this bag.. I've understood you very well. Pardon? Can I have my bag please? Thank you. Never mind! - Thank you. She's here! Hi. - Hi. My name's Ritu. - l'm Muskaan. Are you new in college? How do you find our college? - It's okay. And the peopIe here? - Quite interesting. Friends! Hello, sir. How're you today? Okay? Didn't you get money? - I did. Then why are you playing like this? - What to do? It's my habit as I'm a good player. I've never played for money. Made a mistake. Today, you are, right? - Yes. Play welI and get out soon. - Yes. - Okay? Our team is Iosing. And Suraj is chatting with him merrily? Team spirit! - Yes! You won't understand! How's that! Why are they waving each other goodbye? That's what I was telling you! Team spirit! Team spirit! - Yes! Yes! - Yes! How's that! - Yes! Not out! I was indicating this! Alright. He's out! Stop shaking! I'm getting disturbed! I'm not shaking! It's the breeze which is swinging and shaking my body! Is it? Umpire! - Stop shaking! If a player stops shaking, then how'Il he field? PrincipaI, you know? His shaking's intentional! He's disturbing my player deliberately! - Get lost! The match won't continue! Why? The match will be played! No! - It will! It will! No! - It will. Why not? What're you doing? The principals have been made umpires.. ..to avoid any problem in the match. And both of you're fighting? Both of you should set an example for aIl the students. On field, or off fieId, aIl the players are sportsmen! And the game should be played in the true spirit! No cheating! Where were you lost? - I'm right here. You stop shaking! And you batsman! You stop watching! Come on, sir! - Come on! See? - What? Our captain's handiwork! He's falIen! - Throw the ball! Throw it fast! Come on, hurry up. - Yeah! Howz that! Both of them.. Isn't he looking towards us? Looks Iike a part of our team's pIan. Plan! Give me the ball! Bowl! Come on! I thought cricket is a very sIow and boring game! But I'm enjoying it today. - Aren't you? Thanks to our captain! Hey! Didn't you get the money? - l'm not for sale! Last man, last wicket, last run. I think we'Il lose now. Looks Iike we couldn't set anything with this batsman. What? - I mean, this batsman is well-set! I see! He's welI-set! Catch it! Good catch! - Yeah! We've won! Congrats. Congrats. - Shake hands! Gloves! - Pull it out. Pull out the gloves! At what price did you buy up the team? What did she say? - She said that we played well. My dear, I'm the principaI of the coIlege where you study. I'm sorry. I'm not free. Muskaan, I want to talk to you. l don't have the time to listen to you. How sad! I'll show you now! What're you doing? Stop it! Everybody's watching! Stop it! What's it? l'm gIad you told me everything about yourself. Like you, even l pIay these stupid pranks at home. But I'm true at heart. This impIies you're not angry. - I was never angry. Good morning, sir. Give me. - Here. What's this? Compensation. - Compensation? On the 1st of every month my father.. - Thank you, sir. Sends me lots of love. Muskaan. I have some very urgent work. Shall l leave? Okay. I told you, Iots of Iove. This is it. Where could it disappear? Search every cabinet and drawer! My necklace worth rupees 2.5 million can't get lost! Mother, you never ever considered me a son. And today, you consider me a thief? - Suraj. Dear, what's the need to get anxious if your room is being searched? I'm not anxious, l'm feeling sad. AlI this beIongs to me, doesn't it? - Yes, of course. Wrong, darling. l own an equal share of the inheritance. I'm your father's wife. And by that reIationship, I'm your mother. Madam. There's no necklace in this room. No probIem. Check there. - Yes. Daddy. You've searched my room. Now ask the servants to check her's too. See! Your son thinks l'm a thief! No. - My own necklace.. No, this isn'tjust about the necklace. But of victory and defeat. - What's your implication, Suraj? l wish to tell you for the first time that she's not my mother. She's my stepmother. - Suraj! This has been your weakness in life. You've aIways left your work incomplete. For the sake of peace in this house, it's better that I leave. But where'lI you go? You should've stopped me first. But instead you asked me where I was going. But.. listen.. Relax. Not fair! Why didn't you run after me? Because this bag holds no importance for me. And what about me? Friends? Go, Suraj! Go! Go! Down there! Swine! Don't you even know how to play a game? You always behave childishly! Don't say that! Sour grapes! Come here! Come on, dwarf! - Next! Suraj, why don't you play? I don't play such foolish games! - Listen to this! Let us play. - Okay. 1. 2.. 3! It's a matter of honour! - Come on, Muskaan! He got it! Look, Suraj lost! What did I do? You.. What? Tell me. What did I do? Go on! Hi, Suraj! Dwarf, your height's won't increase by eating this! Fatso, you'll break apart someday, eating this way! You know, great film stars will attend our college annual function! We know. - How? We'll be bringing them. AIl of you? - I mean Suraj. Do you know these film stars? They're Suraj's chiIdhood friends! - Yes, we indeed are! Really? I've only seen them on screen! Now see them cIosely! Stay away! Fool! Would you introduce them to me? Please! Not once, but ten times! - And one autograph, okay? An autograph? Take their entire autobiography! Thank you! Brothers and female friends! Hey! Say sisters! Ok! My Iove to my dear brothers and their sisters! Today, on the day of our college's annual function.. ..I present those personalities who've made India proud! Applaud! Do I look good? - It's a golden chance! Shall I go? HelIo! - A round of appIause for him! Greetings! - And for him! Greetings! - A big hand for him! And a huge round of applause for him! - Hi! For him.. - Greetings. Applaud please! This is how an AnnuaI Day function shouId be! Not like your coIlege! Cheap! - What? I know that you've seen them only on screen. They're very friendly. So you may ask them anything you like. Me.. let me ask a question! - Okay, sir. Sir, may I ask you a question? - Yes. You've started applauding? Let me ask the question first! I've been an ardent fan of yours! I've seen every film of yours. First day, first show! The new generation has taken over. How do you feel about that? - Quiet! These kiddos cannot replace us! Hey you! It's his chiIdhood name! Your eyesight is getting weaker with age! A star like me appears a kid to you! Remain silent for some time, okay? Hey you! You've lost your crowning glory, but not your arrogance! Get a hold on your tongue or.. Or what? Will you go to my father? Where else? He's as old as your father! Down but not out! Your backs are broken, but not your arrogance! - Shut up! Or.. Why are they fighting, Suraj? They're not fighting, they're acting. Hey, you uncouth man! Apologize to me and him! Apologize or.. - Or what? You're threatening me? Shut up! - Hey you! Move ahead! Shut up! - Stop threatening! Just touch me! Shut up! Skinny legs, if I blow, you'Il fIy away! - Shut up! Moustache! - Shaky! Hey, oIdie, have you gone crazy? I'll just come. You called me crazy? What're you doing, sir? - Hey you duplicate, move aside! What? - Was he a duplicate? Obviously! Quiet! - Skinny Iegs.. - Quiet! Look at the person first! He's not a duplicate but the organizer! We've to take money from him. Please go. They're duplicates! Beat them! What's up? Muskaan, I did alI this for you. - I shook hands with them! Cheap? Suraj! Hey, don't worry! Fool! Don't worry indeed! After yesterday's fiasco, the principal wants to meet my parents. And you ask me not to worry! - Why get tensed? Call your parents. They'll come and meet the principal. My parents haven't met me for two years. Will they come to meet the principal? Suraj, what'll happen now? Tell us. I've finished thinking. It's your turn now! Okay. If we had the brains to think, then wouId we be in the same class for 3 years? Fatso! This means I'lI be suspended. How dare you do this? You've threatened my child? - Munna! Don't you know who I am? - Who're you? I'm Suraj Khanna's mother! If I wish, I can buy the entire city in a night! And sell this college in a day! PIease don't do that, madam! What'll I do then? Who the hell is it? - Here I am, sir! Sorry sir! Suraj, come in! - Sir, I.. Look who's here to meet you. - Who? Your mother! - What? Mother! Damn! You? I mean, mother, you? Dear! - Mother! Come and sit. The principal has harassed you a lot, hasn't he? - Yes, mother. No, mother. - No, mother. Looking at your state, I'm thinking of building a new colIege for you! Yes, mother. - No! Here's the cheque book! I'm ready to pay any price for my son's folly! Right, son? WeIl done, child! l mean, mother! Why are both of you laughing? Why? Do you have a problem? No, I don't have a.. - Good. Because you can't afford to have one. I never had a.. - Liar! You've harassed my son a lot. Now tell me what your decision is! It has been decided, madam. From now on, this college belongs to your son. If I could, I'd gift the whole city to Suraj. Right? C'mon - C'mon, Munna! Wait a minute. I'd Iike to tell you something before you leave. Yes? Looking at your love, I remembered my mother! Mother? Take this. She used to also love me like this! She'd also pay for every folly l committed! I mean, she'd discipline me. I can understand your grief! - Don't give me anymore. You'll run out of them. Mother! - Munna! You conned the principal! Mother! How she fooled the principal today! But what happened at the principal's office, Suraj? Ask what didn't happen! Alright! What didn't happen? She turned out to be my mother! - What? I mean, she's a greater prankster than aIl of us together! Without her, the hero of your college wouldn't be here today! Suraj, if the girl smiles, it means she's floored! It's a golden opportunity to tell her what you feel! Shall I? "Listen, beautiful!" "Tell me, dear one!" "TeIl me that you love me. Value my love." "Now don't be shy, beloved." "TeIl me that you love me. Value my love." "Now don't be shy, beloved." "Your thoughts torment me. I can't sIeep at night, my dear." "Stop being stubborn." "Stop being stubborn, crossing the limits, crazy lover." "l don't want to faIl in love with you, O unknown lover." "You don't understand love. Why don't you listen?" "I feel shy, I'm scared." "I've no controI over my heart, beloved." "Don't torment me anymore, come and hug me, beIoved." "I can't bear these distances, I can't live without you." "Get lost, crazy one!" "Get lost, crazy one! Wake up! Why are you after me?" "Why do you hold me like this, grip my arms and pull me?" "l won't come close to you. I'Il go away." "I'll make your heart beat. l'll torture you." "When l saw you for the first time, l fell in love with you." "This lovely style makes me go crazy." "O beautifuI, agree to it quickly." "You don't know anything." "You don't know and understand anything. How do I explain to you?" "O beloved, how do I teIl you my story?" "My heart fears, you're in love with me." "Don't complicate it further, don't be crazy." "TeIl me that you love me. Value my love." "Now don't be shy, beloved." "Your thoughts torment me. I can't sIeep at night, my dear." "Give up being stubborn." "Give up being stubborn, crossing the limits, O crazy lover." "l don't want to faIl in love with you, O unknown lover." "You don't understand love. Why don't you listen?" "I feel shy, I'm scared." "My love, my refusal means agreement." I quit the army for the sake of my chiIdren. I didn't know that.. ..I'd have to proclaim war even after coming to the vilIage! Hit them! Vishal! - UncIe. I hope you aren't hurt. Sorry! How could I hit you? Wait a minute. l've the cure! Fool! Come on! - Papa! Show me your hand! It's heavier than uncIe's! Father, they've broken my bones! - What's wrong, son? Why are you shouting? - Both of them thrashed me very badIy! You can be sure they've seized those fieIds! So you may as well forget it. Worn your shoes? - Certainly. Then let's Ieave the village. - Shut up! Look, Vishal and Thakur have even resorted to fisticuffs now! Decency doesn't work anymore! Ever since they've come, they've been bullying us! No. Even our Iand is being usurped now. This is too much! This calls for a viIlage committee meeting! - Yes father, you're right! Where're we going, uncle? Village committee. - Why? To have our pictures clicked! - Nonsense, uncIe! Gajraj has created a problem again to usurp the land. If he acts smart today, then I'll thrash him before the council! No! Don't be violent there. The committee has its rules and regulations. But if he acts tough, then we'lI tackle the swine! The fact is that I had bought the land near the canal 15 years ago. I paid cash to Ajay Singh's elder brother Pitamber Singh. But we still don't have any right to it! That land belonged to us, it stilI does and will remain so! Respected men, the whole village knows that I've never lied. Gajraj, I don't know much about you. But you do act quite well! Why are you needIessly wasting my time and the council's? Time? You're the one who's taking advantage of time. After your brother's death.. ..you came here to take possession of his inheritance. Spoken enough? Now listen to me! Do understand that my uncle means more than my parents to me! He never got married so that he could raise us! He sacrificed his happiness for ours and you speak of inheritance? He has a right over every inch of us, understand? Understand? Vishal, sit down. Ajay Singh promises before the council, that if Gajraj brings the papers of this land or provides any proof, then I'Il transfer this land in his name today itself! After listening to everything.. ..the council gives its verdict in favour of Thakur. Henceforth, if you try to create a rift in my famiIy.. ..then the council wiIl not give a verdict, I wilI! Father, get ready. - Why? We'll escape then! No, it'll not happen. Wonder how it'll happen. When it'll happen.. - What is it? What is it? What is it? - What is it? Uncle, he was talking to himself, not to you. What else can I do? OnIy Muskaan used to talk in this house. She's gone to the city! Now l talk to myself and get entertained! Spoken enough? - Yes. What's the matter, Vishal? Are you missing Muskaan? I'm going to DeIhi for some work regarding the land. Go and meet Muskaan. Come on. Vishal! Are you going to the city? - Yes. To meet Muskaan? - Yes. Give this to Muskaan on my behalf. Okay. What'll I do? When it comes to this, I haven't seen a bigger coward than you! That isn't the case! I'm giving a flower to someone for the first time. What if she rejects? Have you turned deaf? Didn't you hear what she said? What? - Her refusal means acceptance. Yes! Let's go then. - Come on. How dare you! Suraj, pIease try to understand. He's my.. We'll tackle him! What's it? Go on, my rhinoceros! Charge! Wow! What a body! Oh god! He's very strong! You're being beaten up in front of the whole coIlege! You should've at least thought of our honor. l'd think of honor only if I remain aIive. That fellow hit me from behind. He hit all of us so much. Go and hit him at least twice. Is it? I'lI beat him so hard that he'll come to his senses! Go! Don't spare him! Muskaan! Can't you do something? Please! Oh God! I hit you twice! Come on! Oh God! Oh God. Who's this taIl and hefty man? - That's what I wanted to telI you. He's my elder brother - Brother? Let's go. Big brother. Listen to me. l listen to onIy those who're elder to me or equal to me. That's why l'm teIling you that Muskaan is my.. - Spoken enough? If you say a word, then I'Il slice your tongue off! Excuse me, sir! At least listen to me! You listen to me! And if you have a weak memory, then write it down! This was onIy a trailer. Henceforth, if you try to meet her, it'll be your end! He hit me so hard that everything's dislocated! A brother-sister bond is so strange, isn't it? When it was the brother's turn to get beaten, Muskaan took him away. Or we'd have beaten him. Brother. Please Iisten to me. - Is there anything Ieft to hear? They didn't know that you're my brother. And l'm responsible for it. Had l toId them that I've a brother like you.. ..then nobody wouId befriend me, just like in the viIlage. Spoken enough? You came here to study, not to make friends. I made good friends for the first time.. ..and you fought with them too. - Wrong. He started the fight. l onIy ended it. Poor Suraj.. ..has been fixed. Come on, hurry up. Time for the bus to leave. Come on. Give it to me, sir. Dear, you've to go this way. Come on. Come on, hurry up! Start the bus. Brother-in-law, even I've to go where you've to! Good night! See you at the village! Ujala! Alright! What're you doing here? Waiting. - And I was searching for you at home. Father, get used to living alone. I'll be staying in this house after some days. You can't have your way until a match is found for Muskaan. And l wonder how that boy wiIl be.. ..who'lI challenge Vishal. Come on, hurry up. Come on, hurry up. Let's go! Oh no! You go to Thakur's farmhouse daily, don't you? Where else will I go to build these muscles, if not there? What's up, dude? He's milkman, I'm a carriage rider. - Greetings. Is the carriage vacant? - Do you see anybody? No, right? - No. Then get in and telI me the address. Thakur's house. - Hey! My carriage isn't vacant! Go! Why? - Why? Are you Thakur's kith or kin? - No. A relative? - I soon will be. Are you trying to woo Vishal Thakur's sister by any chance.. Hey! You may be fond of breaking your limbs but I'm not! And if he learns that I brought you to his farmhouse.. ..then you'll Ieave the village but I'lI leave this world! Try to understand. - You aren't taking me there.. ..at least show me the way. l'lI tell you the shortest route to get there. Behind the hills is a river which fIows through Thakur's farmhouse. Now you can either swim or drown to get there. I'll read about you in the newspaper tomorrow. 25 rupees. Why? - 10 rupees for guiding you, 15 for the bandages! It's so risky to give you the address! I don't have change! Crazy! "I, crazy one, am going, looking for her with love." "I, crazy one, am going.." "O breeze, tell me the address to her house." "I, crazy one, am going, looking for her with love." "I, crazy one, am going." "Oh what a climate, what a sky, the whole world is joyous." "The weather is beautiful." "Oh what a climate, what a sky, the whole world is joyous." "The weather is beautiful." "This scene is beautiful, so are these clouds." "I, crazy one, am going, looking for her with love." "I, crazy one, am going." "She'Il feel shy, she'Il be scared." "Then she'll come close to me." "I won't let her go." "She'Il feel shy, she'Il be scared." "Then she'll come close to me." "I won't let her go." "We'Il hug each other then." "I, crazy one, am going, looking for her with love." "I, crazy one, am going." Nobody knows Vishal better than you. Yet you befriended that boy? I don't know how all this happened, Ujala. Friendship or Iove? Muskaan, forget him. Like you said, after being so badly beaten up by Vishal.. ..he must've also forgotten you. Tell me something. Is Suraj 5 feet 10 inches taIl? Fair complexioned? With big eyes? Yes, but how do you know all this? Because I can see him. - What? Hi. No! I'm coming! What do we do now? - Get rid of him, while I handle Vishal. Hi! - What kind of insanity is this? What if brother Vishal sees you? - But I've come to meet him. You don't know my brother. He.. - l'm here to know him. What's this? You've just come back and have already started working? Move aside or I'lI slice you also into two! Please try to understand me! It's not the time to understand, but to explain. Please leave. l'm very scared. What if anything happens to you? Muskaan, do you Iove me? Yes. Then why fear when in love? Big brother! Vishal, Iet go of him! - Move aside! One minute.. please listen to what I have to say. I, myself, am surprised that I have come tilI here for Muskaan. I know you love her a Iot and can do anything to protect her. I don't even sat that I am the best match for Muskaan. But I will keep her very happy as I love her very dearIy Please give me a chance OnIy one chance. Please give me a chance. - Spoken enough? Come with me. Come on. Hi Horsie! Hi Horsie! That's it! That's enough! I've been reiterating since so long to him that I love Muskaan.. ..but he just refuses to understand! Come on, return home! You have everything! So? I have everything.. except Muskaan. This route will take you to the city where you have all the comforts. And this route will take you to Muskaan. Where her bIoody brother will make your life a hell. On this side, is your father's wealth in abundance. And on the other, is Muskaan's true Iove. Over here, is the same, old, rotten life. And over there, is destination So the right decision is to go left or to go right. You! Fool! Are you blind! Do you drink and drive? ShaIl I hit you!! Thank you, young man. - You are welcome, sir. I have never seen you here before. I am new here. Well, every newcomer has some or the other destination. Yes, I do. But the path is very difficult. If there is a destination, then the path cannot be difficult. I feel that l have met with an accident.. ..but you are the one affected by its outcome. That isn't the case, sir. Why do you look so suIlen? Sorrow is not befitting on such an adorable face. You have Ient me your hand. It's a great gesture. Can't l bring Muskaan (smile) into your Iife? That is why I have come here, sir. Come on, man. Come on. One shouId not be disheartened. This is what I've learnt from life. Everything is fair in love and war. Sir, after listening to you, I have decided.. not to Ieave this place until my mission is successful. Oh, you are welcome. Stay with me. But there is a condition, sir I will help you with your work. Yes, why not? This is my house. - But why is it so dark here? We often face power cuts here. This is always a.. Tadkalal! I'm here, uncle. Vishal? - Yes, uncle. You're back? - Yes, uncle. How's Muskaan? - Fine. She is aIso back. Really? She's back with you? That's good. - Yes, uncle. Uncle, why have you come so late at night? I met with a minor accident. You aren't hurt, are you? - Absolutely not. This boy helped me out. - Thank you. He will stay with us for some days. Make the necessary arrangements. Okay, uncle. Oh Muskaan, how are you my darling, how are you. l'm fine UncIe. - Oh so sweet. He is Suraj.. and she is my Muskaan. Come inside. Brother.. destiny has brought him back here. There must be something about it. I can empathise with your anger at having to hide this from uncle. But for my sake, can't you give even a littIe time to understand Suraj? He's not a bad boy. In fact, he's a good boy. I know that you love me very much. But even I love Suraj a Iot. I am a hen man! Is he the man of your choice? - Yes. Okay. What will happen now? Brother has taken Suraj to show the estate. Damn! Suppose Suraj also runs away like BilIu, then? I wonder what plight brother must have put Suraj in by now! Don't worry. Your city boy will handIe things weIl. Big brother, l really enjoyed! I have come Iying alI the way! Thank you, big brother! Goodman good, thank you. You will work with them today - Okay. As welI as cook for the day. Okay. No problem. Chinese, chow-chow. Okay, go now! Now the best meaIs will be ready. Vishal dear, call.. - Tadkalal Tell him.. - Get food.. Quickly. Hungry.. - I'm feeling very hungry. Tadkalal is not here today. I've given him leave. Who'Il prepare the meals today? - Suraj Suraj? Can he cook? UjaIa.. - Yes, Uncle? It's my leg. Hi! - Hello! What's wrong with you? Here I come! Eat and enjoy! If you taste it, you'Il never forget it! Understand, guests and devils! I'm sorry. I mean to say, brother! This is for you! Diet food! Carrots and fish! Uncle, this is for you! - Really? This is for you, coloneI! It's very.. Very tasty, isn't it? - Yes! You've cooked delicious food. Good! Thank you, sir. Eat food! Take it! The food is tasty. l've tolerated you because of your sister! What nonsense is this? - This is no nonsense, but love! Love? And you? Vishal, just watch, someday.. - Spoken enough? Now listen to me. And stop acting stupid. We're not children anymore. Why don't you understand this? Control your youth, understand? "Listen.." "Listen, O crazy one, your youth is very beautiful." "Your youth is very beautiful." "This wet cIimate, these dark clouds." "The paths of love are siIent." "This is the time to love." "Your youth.." "Your youth is very beautiful." "Ever since I saw your youth, I've gone crazy." "This atmosphere is asking you to" "come into my arms, as the weather is beautifuI." "Give me some Iove, give peace to my heart." "My eyes are thirsty, let me see you." "You're so coIorful, you're so beautiful." "Beware of the world, you're gorgeous." "Everyone has a roving eye." "Your youth.." "Your youth is very beautiful." "How long will you remain angry? For how long can you avoid me?" "You'll crazily search for me, when Iove casts its spelI." "You're every heart's dream, you're like a glass of wine." "You're amazing. You're incredibIe." "Your gait's lovely, the world's crazy about you." "Everyone wants your grace." "All are selfish." "Your youth is very beautiful." "This wet cIimate, these dark clouds." "The paths of love are siIent." "This is the time to love." "Your youth is very beautiful." Vishal, did you make Suraj stay in the stable? Yes, uncle. - Why? Since Muskaan is at home. - You become old-fashioned at times! He's a good boy. I know him. Alright. As you wish! Suraj! I've been waiting for you since so Iong. What could I do? I had to dodge brother and come. Bloody brother! Don't say a word against my brother. Wow! You're defending your brother a lot! I'm brother's biggest responsibility. He loves me a lot. Yes, you're right! Only brother's love is true, mine isn't! - Enough, Suraj! There's no need to get so emotional! - l said you're right. I've no value. I left everything and came here! I've become a tourist! You don't realize the tension you've caused at home. I've caused it! Is it because of me or that bull? - Spoken enough? Even she? But it suits her! "I'm in love with you, beloved, my heart beats faster too." "Because you're different." "I'm in love with you, beloved, my heart beats faster too." "Because you're different." "Be careful, in Iove you might get beaten up!" "Brother doesn't like you!" "I'm in love with you, beloved, my heart beats faster too." "Because you're different." "Be careful, in Iove you might get beaten up!" "Brother doesn't like you!" "My brother will make you toil hard." "Get lost! Your brother too wilI become helpless, if I wish." "Whoever messes with me wilI be hanged upside down." "I'm different too." "I'm in love with you, beloved, my heart beats faster too." "Because you're different." "Be careful, in Iove you might get beaten up!" "Brother doesn't like you!" "I want to attain you, I've decided." "Let anyone do anything." "I'm with you too, my beloved." "We'Il fight the worId bravely." "But you'll have to pIease brother, learn that by heart." "Brother doesn't like you!" "I'm in love with you, beloved, my heart beats faster too." "Because you're different." "Your village is very lovely! I've gone crazy after coming here." Brother, I'm thinking of settling here after marriage. Alive or dead? Wow! A village beIle! Hi, girIs! How're you today? Cool! You're Iooking pretty! Bye, babes! Bye. What's this? - What? What kind of an act was this? - Which one? These girls are not my type! I see. Then what's your type? Get down! Stop! Stop, will you? - You'll become my brother-in-law! Want to see? - Stop! Who're you? - Vijay Singh. This is not your fight, but ours! His fight is mine too! How many will you kill? OnIy you! I won't spare you! Let's go! I won't spare you! - Get lost! Vijay Singh. - Vishal Thakur. Let me drop you home. Idiots. Please come in. Some other time. We'll keep meeting now. Be carefuI. - Why? You're new here. And you've made enemies because of me. But I've also found a friend Iike you. She's my younger sister. I'll leave. What're you eating? Grams? He feeds you grams and makes me sleep here! Stop all this! And Iet me sleep! Keep a watch at night! Didn't I ask you to guard the fieIds at night? You did ask! So? Then what're you doing here? l'm going! - Take this. For what? - For your safety. Really? - Yes. But why? - Because tigers aIso roam there at night. Tigers! Me! Stick! Tiger! Tigers! "A head massage!" "When you feel giddy, or are depressed." "Come to me, dear, why do you worry?" "..why do you worry?" "A head massage!" What's it, Muskaan? You appear very happy today. Obviously! Ujala, who's the same age as me. Amar Singh is coming tomorrow to see my friend, Why? The colonel is worried about her marriage. Ujala is not a child anymore, she has grown up like me. Really? - They'Il discuss her marriage. You'll come, won't you? - What wilI I do there? What're you saying, brother? Ujala has grown up only for you. - What? I mean, she has grown up with you, with us. We're from the bride's side! You must be from the bride's side! But we'lI have to see how the boy is, what he does.. ..whether he'll keep Ujala happy or not. Ok, I've a Iot of work to do for tomorrow. l'll Ieave now. Ok. Good night. - Good night. Any tension, brother? Spoken enough? How much does your daughter weigh? What're you asking? She's my daughter, not a goat! Good lord! Here comes the troubIe! Who's he? He looks like the girl's uncIe! Hey! Your father must be her uncle! How can my father be her uncle? Vishal, don't do anything that'Il ruin my daughter's Iife. Sir, look at me! What're you whispering? Who's he, where has he come from and why's he here? Sir, he's Vishal Thakur. A Iowly man compared to me! Hey! - What? Shall we come to the point now? Sir, I'm no match for you. l'll not be able to give you any dowry. His family never takes dowry! They only give! Are you in such a bad state that.. ..you'll marry your daughter to these fools? lnsult! - What're you doing, brother? Wedding bells will not chime in this house now! Get Iost! I've seen many like you! Vishal, what're you doing? If they go away, then who'lI marry my daughter? What does your daughter lack? You'll find many. You were the one who'd always find faults in her. Hey! Leave her hand! - Quiet! If he leaves her hand, will you marry her? Will you? Answer, brother. - Yes, answer! What'll he say? People become speechless before me! TeIl me, Vishal. What's your answer? I'll marry you. Hey! Spoken enough? Brother! Fantastic, Suraj! You massage legs very welI! - Thank you, sir. You know, a very affluent man had come to see Ujala? Yes, l do. And brother Vishal drove them away. You know how our Vishal is! It's obvious from this that he must be loving Ujala a Iot. Yes, he does. Don't you feeI you should taIk to the colonel.. ..and get Vishal and Ujala married? But it'll be futile, Suraj. I know he won't get married until a match is found for Muskaan. Does it imply that he and not you, will find a groom for Muskaan? No, that's not the case. I know that they'lI never refuse me. But I've bestowed this right to Vishal. What's wrong? - Nothing. Just a pain in the neck. Come here. - No, sir! I'Il massage it. - Please leave me, sir! Strange! Hey! Come here! Oh no! Are you in a bad mood? Shall I tell you a joke? Once it so happened that.. What kind of a joke is this? This is not a joke, but a test. This is insanity, Vishal! Even you could never control this wild horse and that poor boy.. Wild.. Wild isn't pronounced like that! At least stammer properly! That.. - Wild! Who asked him to mount this wild horse? Is this your prank? - No uncle. He thinks he's a great rider. Suraj! Are you alright? He's a strong boy. Hey, you! Why are you being nasty with me? I know you're smitten by that mare. What that fool hasn't done for you in so many years, I'll do it for you in 5 minutes! Tonight after the lights go off. What's he taIking? - Even I'm smitten. Please let me mount you, my love! It's a matter of honour. What's he whispering to the horse? Say yes! Wow! Good! Good! Fantastic, Suraj! Even we couldn't get a hold on this horse. - Thank you, sir. Love possesses great strength. Yes, it does. This horse belongs to you from now on. Thank you, sir. "I'm madly in love with you." "l'm lost in your love, I've forgotten myself, my beloved." "I'm madly in love with you." "We're not concerned about the worId." "What's there to fear when we love each other?" "You're madly in love with me." "We're not concerned about the worId." "What's there to fear when we love each other?" "I'm madly in love with you." "This heart was alone and lost." "There was restIessness, the heart was silent." "Ever since I've found you, all complaints have disappeared." "I too have decided that I'Il marry you." "You're madly in love with me." "We're not concerned about the worId." "What's there to fear when we love each other?" "I'm madly in love with you." "Oh god, these eyes say a thousand things." "Wonder what magic this is, my heart is out of control." "I always pray to god to attain you." "Give me the adoration of love, make an auspicious beginning, beloved." "I'm madly in love with you." "We're not concerned about the worId." "What's there to fear when we love each other?" "I'm madly in love with you." Vijay Singh, I'm very pleased to meet you. You've rescued Vishal. Do keep coming here. Yes. Everything will be fine once the land dispute is solved. Land dispute? I know many people here. I'll be very glad to be of any help to you. Thank you very much. Vishal, l'll Ieave now. Greetings. - Bless you. Uncle, I'Il see him off. - Okay. Okay. He's a good boy. How's he for Muskaan? What? Are you saying this? - Yes, uncle. Do you Iike him? - I approve of the boy. Fine. We'lI talk to his parents. This is incredible! You've chosen a boy for Muskaan today! Fantastic! Suraj! I did everything possible to win over Vishal. But today, he has chosen somebody eIse for you. Dear. Hey! I hope you're not hurt. Come. Father. If your company works in collaboration with ours.. ..then we'Il fix our son Suraj's alliance with your daughter. It's not a bad deal, Mr. Malhotra. Think about it. - Hello. Who's speaking? Suraj. Give the phone to father. - Just a minute, sir. Sir. Hello. Daddy, this is Suraj. - Yes, Suraj! How're you? - Fine. And how're you? I need you. - Why? Have you finished your money? Shall I send some? No. I don't need money, l need you. What's the matter, Suraj? Is everything okay? Dear.. Dear, your dad is in the midst of a very important meeting. Call up later, okay? HeIlo! Hello! - You.. What happened? Disconnected. - Disconnected? Take this inside. What're you doing? Why are you destroying my phone booth? Sir.. - Move! Move! Being an elder brother, I used to think that I had the right to make every decision regarding Muskaan. That she'd be happy with every decision I take, but it isn't so. I don't quite understand. Vijay, I don't want to beat around the bush. l need some more time regarding Muskaan. I understand, Vishal. It's the question of Muskaan's life. Even if it takes some more time, I've no problem. But she should be happy with your decision. Thank you. I expected this from you. What a plan it was! - That was great! Wealth, wife and Iand! What's the matter with you? Father, it's time to scoot! - What? Vijay, I'm not surprised at you, but at myself.. ..as to how I could fail to recognize a person. Now you know to what extent we can go to achieve our goal. You've already crossed all Iimits by just thinking about Muskaan. Vishal Thakur! This is just the beginning. - ReaIly? Then even I'm prepared. Son, what've you done? You've declared war! Brother, you don't know them. MuscIe power is all they know! Perhaps, I don't know them. But I do know their weakness. Muskaan, I trusted you impIicitly. You've caused me immense grief by hiding this from me. You've given me a big shock. Please forgive me, uncle. I've hurt you. But you teIl me, uncle. What else couId I do? Uncle, we've committed a big folly. Please forgive us. Suraj. Where've you come from? - I'm Akash Khanna, Suraj's father. They're my parents. We searched for you everywhere. Your friends have told us everything. I had left home long back. But how did you remember me after so many days? What do you mean by that? You've always.. - Son. We've fixed your alliance with the richest family in India. lt must've been a big business deal. Talk sense, Suraj. Dad. What's surprising is that this is where I've come to my senses. We'll be left nowhere if.. Your aIliance can never get fixed with this family! We're poles apart! Mrs. Khanna. - Suraj! You've forgotten that she's your mother. - No, dad. She's a mother only for namesake. And the peopIe whom she's taIking about are not rich like you.. ..but they're far more respectabIe than she is. My foot! Can I meet the girl from that respectable family.. ..who's responsible for all the trouble? Where's she? Hey.. I stopped him, madam. But if you say a word more against Muskaan.. ..then nobody will be able to stop me! Muskaan, wait! Muskaan. We've come here to take our son Suraj.. ..whom you've trapped in your daughter farcical love! Don't consider our toIerance to be our weakness, Mr. Khanna! It'll be wise if you Ieave quickly! - UncIe.. - C'mon. Vijay Singh has abducted Muskaan! No! You won't go anywhere! Dad. I love Muskaan a lot! And l love you a lot! I don't want to lose you again! Then become the same father as before! What're you doing? This is not our fight. Let him go if he wants to. You always complained that I left things incomplete. Today l'll complete it. Uncle! Brother! Go and beat them! Uncle! Go! Suraj! Uncle! Leave me! I told you! If you play dirty again.. I'lI take the decision, not the village committee! Father, come on! Can you drive the tractor? - Yes! Come on! Left! Right! Turn right! Take aim! Fire! He has a gun! Move aside! I'm dead! Isn't she everybody's darling and weakness? Brother! Uncle! Suraj! Oh no! Hit him! Help! What's happening! Father, the police have aIso come! What're you thinking about now? Don't worry. I'll have a village committee meeting again. Go ahead, but in prison! Quiet! - You keep quiet! - Shut up! "I'm madly in love with you." "We're not concerned about the worId." "What's there to fear when we love each other?" "You're madly in love with me." "We're not concerned about the worId." "What's there to fear when we love each other?"
