["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] [horse neighing] [shouting] - I, King Solomon, Lord of Amancia, promise to spare the life of every man, woman, and child on condition that they cease all resistance to the law. That they are friendly towards our citizens. And they pay tributes every year at the court of the king. It is my wish that everyone should return to his town or village and live peacefully forever. Have you anything to say? - What's the point of talking? Do we have any choice? [dramatic music] - Princess Maria. Bishop Osarios. Commander Antoine. [dramatic music] - What are you doing here? - I felt very lonely in my quarters and if you don't mind I wanted to be with you for a while. You proved you are a noble leader. I like being in your company. We have you to thank for everything. - But that's no reason for you to be in here. - My lord, it's not only that I'm grateful to you. There's something else, a confession I have to make. I want you to know that I'm attracted to you as a man too. That's strange, it looks like a tattoo. - No, it's a birthmark. All the men in my family are born with it on their left shoulders. - So if I have a son by you he will also have the birthmark, won't he? - It's morning already, it's time for me to go. Goodbye, Maria. - Goodbye. [suspenseful music] [drumming] - This treaty is a disgrace. It's a trick to keep us quiet while Solomon sucks our blood away. We must fight it, must get armed and ready any way we can. Organize ourselves to fight a war of revenge. - There are plenty of brave men ready to help you, Sir Antoine. They are good soldiers, and all they need are the weapons. - There has to be a way to get them. As soon as we can do it we'll start fighting right here. We'll attack King Solomon in his own palace and surprise him. We'll fight him til he drops. - He saved all our lives. Do you have to murder him for that? Haven't we had enough bloodshed? Why can't you let our people live in peace for a change? - Revenge! We must have revenge! We're going to fight til every single one of them is dead. And no woman's going to stand in our way. - There's no need to get angry with her, Antoine. I'm sure Princess Maria knows only too well what happens to people who sympathize with the enemy. Dear Princess, affairs of state are far more important than your private feelings. You should agree to a marriage and let your husband handle those decisions. - But I don't want to get married. - It's not a question of what you want. Last night the general council held a meeting and they voted unanimously that you should immediately marry Sir Antoine. [dramatic music] - Antoine? Never. - Maria. I don't think you'd like the alternative very much. You'd be tortured and thrown to the wolves like a common prostitute. If you refuse I'll tell the whole country about your little affair with King Solomon. Please, step forward Sir Antoine. Kneel down. [organ music] In the name of almighty God and for the security and protection of our nation, I pronounce you man and wife. - I call on every man to take this solemn oath of allegiance with me. We swear to wipe out the shameful humiliation that we have suffered. - [All] We swear! ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] - Friends, we must be ready to move right away. Now get to your positions and stand by. - The whole of the Byzantine Empire is under our control, Amelia. Soon our people will rule the entire world. If you can only give me a son Amelia you can have anything you want. - My lord, if I had a son I'd want nothing else. - Let's hope God listens to our prayers. - Take Sir Antoine to the court. I will go and inform King Solomon. - Bring the tribute. ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] Your excellency will honor us by accepting these carefully chosen gifts from your faithful servant Antoine and the Byzantine people. Please accept this magnificent carpet we brought specially from [speaking foreign language]. Unroll it. [grunts] [shouting] - You must save Amelia, Rhastim. - Kill him, crush him! He falls, catch him! - You filthy worm, Antoine. - Follow him! - My god. - You must get to the secret passage and escape, Amelia. - I can't abandon you now. - You must go at once for the sake of our child. Rhastim, stand by and see that she gets away. May God be with you. - And you too. [shouting] - Stop, leave him to me! [suspenseful music] - The pains are starting now, I can't stand it. - You must try, my lady. - I can't walk anymore. - Just a few more to go. Come on. [groaning]. My lady. I'm going to look for a doctor. Don't worry. - [Amelia] Rhastim, baby's coming. [groaning] - They must be somewhere around here. We will find them. [baby crying] [suspenseful music] - A boy. And he has the mark on his shoulder. Save my child. [gentle music] - She's dead. Let's get that dog Rahstim. [suspenseful music] - Hey, soldiers! This way! [lion roaring] [dramatic music] Oh my god. - At last we're the masters again. Any of Solomon's rabble, those who are still alive, from this day on will be our slaves. Gentlemen, I drink to victory. - [All] We drink to victory. - Got good news my lord, a very healthy boy. He was born with blood in his hand. [baby crying] - He is his father's son, with blood in his hands. Look, do you like it? I took it straight off Lady Amelia's neck after she died. [gasps] - Graverobber, murderer! - Guards! Guards! [dramatic music] Take her to the dungeon. Lock her up until she dies. [screams] - No, no! [screaming] No give me my baby! [gentle music] [lions roaring] [suspenseful music] - Tell me my son, how should we punish these ones who don't pay their taxes? - Father I would hang them by the feet and whip them til they pay up. - You heard what he said. Get started with it then. [horses neighing] - Father, what are we waiting for? We've got the weapons, everyone's ready. We could attack Antoine. I think we can easily get rid of him and his vicious son Altar. - That's alright. We can't attack now. We don't have many men. We'll have to wait til we find Lord Solomon's son where he's hiding in the forest with the lions. Give it a little water. We must have a leader who has Solomon's mark on his shoulder or we'll never beat Antoine and his boy Altar or any of his bunch of bullies. - How about using a different tactic? Instead of fighting them all at once, why not ambush them? And pick them off one by one. At least we'll be doing something instead of just sitting around. - No my dear. They'd realize it was us immediately. We must keep our forces hidden until the right day comes. [lions roaring] [suspenseful music] [shouting] [screaming] - You bastards. You won't pay your taxes. Pick fights with our soldiers. I'll crucify the whole bunch of you. You scum! Kill 'em. Kill the men and take the women. [screaming] [laughing] [lions roaring] [shouting] [hitting] Catch him, catch him quick! [shouting] [light music] - I don't dance for gold. I'll be dancing for you. - Don't try anything too clever. - Don't worry. I can easily see that you've got eyes for nobody else but Selma my lord. - I've got eyes for any beautiful woman. - Not here, my lord. But you can have anything you want if you meet me by the lake in the forest first thing tomorrow morning. - In the forest, did you say? - That's right, or are you afraid of that lion creature, my lord? - Me, afraid? I don't know the meaning of the word. I'll be there for sure. - Good, I'll see you tomorrow morning by the lake. I like men who've got a lot of courage. I hope you don't forget. - I won't forget, my sweetheart. If death itself were waiting for me, I'd be there. - I want 10 strong men to be by the lakeside early tomorrow morning. - Your father will be furious Ida, forget it. - He won't even know. There are plenty of thugs down at the harbor. If you pay them enough they'd murder their own mothers, let alone Altar. - You can't do it, Ida. I'm really in love with him. [suspenseful music] If you can kill him I promise to pay you three times the amount we agreed. He's coming, hide. - Where are you, sweetheart? - [Ida] Here my lord, behind the tree. [dramatic music] [shouting] - Who are you? You saved my life. Even if you won't tell me your name, from now on you're my friend. - He didn't even have a knife, and there were 10 of you against him. And you ran off like chickens! - It wasn't like a man, it was a monster! A wild animal! - He had claws like a lion. We're lucky he didn't kill us. - I'll kill him. [dramatic music] Use your ropes to catch him. [shouting] [romantic music] [slaps] [suspenseful music] The lion mark. Oh my god, what have I done? I need help Selma, quick! Run to my father, tell him we've found lion man. - Who's lion man? - Why didn't you study a little bit of history instead of flirting with Altar and his crowd? Lion man's the son of Solomon, he was raised by lions. Look, he's got the mark on his shoulder. Go on, get moving! Tell me father, tell him to come. - What makes you think that Solomon's son is still alive? - This woman told me, father. - Tell us what you know. What was it you saw? - My lord, I saw him with my own eyes. He's got the lion mark on his shoulder. - If you're telling us the truth there will be a good reward. Show us the way! - Yes, your excellency. [exciting music] - Come with me. You better stay here for a while. - You see the hut over there? - Where did you hide him? - He ran away. I lost track of him in the forest. - If you are lying to me, you know what the punishment is, don't you? - Liar! She's lying. He was too badly wounded to run away. The boat's not here. She must have hidden him nearby. [dramatic music] - You little tramp, you maggot! - Don't be stupid. If you tell us where you've hidden him I might be able to save you. I could give you everything you want If you'd just cooperate with us. - Everything in this country belongs to us anyway. You've got nothing you can give me, nothing except your life. - What about him? The man you're hiding from us? What could he possibly give you? - He could give me two things you would never understand. Honesty and freedom. [dramatic music] - Search everywhere! [suspenseful music] - I swore that I would destroy you before I knew who you were. But I already owe you my life. Now we're even. Don't you ever let me see you again. If I do I'll have to kill you. - Well? - We can't find him anywhere. - You damn liar. Tell me! Where'd you hide him? - I never saw him. - I know how to make you talk. You'll soon be singing like a bird. Tie a rock to her feet and hang her over the water. - Rhastim, Rhastim! Antoine's got Ida strung up by the lake! We've got to hurry or he'll kill her! - There's nothing we can do. We haven't got enough men. Antoine's got soldiers everywhere. - We will attack them. With any luck we can save her. - Even for my own daughter I can't possibly ask all of you to die. I can't risk the future of my people. We do nothing. [suspenseful music] - Are you ready to talk now? - Never. - Drop her. Enough. Drop her. Lift her. Lift her I said. Let it go. - Father, father, what are you doing? - Get out of my way, you fool. Let her drop! Up now. Archers, kill them! [shouting] [hitting] - Rhastim, Ida's coming. [sweeping music] - Ida, my daughter! How did you get away from Antoine? Who's this? - It's Solomon's son, lion man. - How do you know it's really him? - Look father, there's the birthmark on his shoulder. - The lion man. The lion man! [exciting music] - [All] Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! - The savior of Solomon's people is here with us. From now on victory will surely be ours, my friends. - [All] On to victory! - Water. [mumbling] Say bread. [mumbling] Say bread. - Say bread. Say bread. [gentle music] - All of you were armed to the teeth and you couldn't even catch an animal. You call yourselves warriors? I want that brute here within three days, is that clear? Or you'll all be skinned alive! You too Altar. Don't slack off just because you're my son, understand? If you think you can govern this country, you have to prove it to me. - If you like, I can tell you the best way of catching lion man. - You can? - Well I know the way to do it. But first you must help me. - Tell me what it is you'd like me to do for you. - Nothing you can't do if you try. I want you. I want you to agree to be all mine. Then I'll tell you everything. Think it over. And if you like the idea, I will be waiting for you. The best way of catching him? I know all the places where they'd hide him in the forest. - They've got lookouts everywhere. They'd vanish before we got anywhere near them. - It'll be alright. I know how to handle everything. Now, let's stop worrying. [dramatic music] - What's wrong? Don't you want me anymore? - Of course I do, it's just that I've discovered something that will make you mine forever. Either you're going to stay all mine or you'll be killed. [shouting] [hitting] - Well done boy. Good work. You picked it up faster than I thought you would. This is Hammerfist. And this is the famous Ox. There's not a man alive who could beat either of them. - Me. Me. - How'd you like to take me on? [shouting] - Keep your eyes open. If you let him get away with it this time you'll all pay for it. Get me every single one of them and I want the lion man alive. - Don't worry about it. While I'm keeping them busy in the secret passage you'll have time to track them down. Alright then, let's get a move on. Come on, show us what you can do. - [Guard] Halt! - I want to see the commander. - Over there. - What do you want, you lousy bitch? - Please, I'm so ashamed of what I've done. I want to see Rhastim and Solomon. ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] - Where's that wild man of yours now? Isn't he going to come and save you? [shouting] [hitting] Kill him, kill the dog! Give yourself up or I'm gonna kill her. - I think I'm a very lucky man to have been given a son as brave and daring as you. You've managed this thing really well. Between the two of us we've crushed them completely. On Sunday morning they will all be executed. Take them! [bells gonging] - Where have you been? I've been looking for you for hours. - Get your hands off me and never touch me again. - How can you treat me like this? Don't you realize I betrayed my own people just for you? - I wouldn't be surprised a woman who betrayed her own people did the same to me someday. - Altar couldn't have allowed these horrors. My son could never do such things. - Antoine's son is vicious enough to do anything. - No. My son's got nothing to do with Antoine. - What are you talking about? Aren't they father and son? All this time in the cells must have driven you mad. - A lie, it's a lie, it's not possible! He's my son. - They both have the same mark on their shoulders. Everyone knows that only the sons of King Solomon are born with a lion birthmark on them. [suspenseful music] - I don't believe it. I can't. - Princess Maria can tell you. Only she would know the truth. I heard the two of them talking in Solomon's room that morning. - So the slut. She deceived me too, did she? Tell me the truth. [cries out] [slaps] You dirty slut! Who is Altar's father? - Who do you think? You of course. - Tell me whose bastard he is. Tell me! - You really want to know, don't you? Alright, I'll tell you and I hope it chokes you. I kept it quiet all these years just for my son's sake but now you've gone too far. - What have you kept quiet? - I've only loved one man in my life. King Solomon. And I'll always be proud to say he was the father of my child. - I should have slit your throat, Maria. But you're not going to die yet, not until you've seen the revenge I am taking on you and your bastard son. [suspenseful music] - Who is that woman, father? - That's King Solomon's bitch. I wanted her to watch you kill her son. Alright? - But it's nothing to do with her, father. This is something between men. - You don't understand. When you exterminate Solomon's son then I can be really proud of you. [suspenseful music] Untie him. - Bring the knives. [dramatic music] - You must kill the pig. His father killed your father, don't have any mercy. [shouting] [hitting] You're doing well my boy. - Give me a sword. - No. My son must finish off the job without weapons. - I will not fight against an unarmed man. [crashing] [shouting] [dramatic music] - Stop, don't kill him, he's your brother! Don't fight against each other, Antoine's the one who should die. - They're brothers! - You're both the sons of King Solomon. You both have the mark on your shoulders. - Don't listen to the bitch. You're my son. Take the sword. Kill him, Altar. - I'm telling the truth! [dramatic music] - Brother. [cries out] - My son. You will be the first to die, Antoine. ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] [hitting] [shouting] - Follow me, I know where there's a secret passage. Quick, go on. - Open it up. You can't even open a door for me, you idiots! Bring me the acid. Hurry. - Don't wait for me. - We can't leave without you! - Leave it to me, you clowns. Get out. ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] [sizzling] [screams] - [Rhastim] His bones have melted into each other. A miracle he's still alive. - His fingers have been eaten away. He'll never be able to use them. If we don't bind his wounds he'll die. We must try to get a doctor right away. - At the village there's a blacksmith who knows a little bit of medicine. Let's hope we can get him there before it's too late. [dogs barking] [shouting] We'll rest here a while. - All this happened because of me. If I hadn't helped, Antoine could never have gotten his hands on my brother. Oh god, why did it have to be him? It should have been me. I was the one who should have died instead. - You can't question God's will. This isn't the time, nor the place for regrets. Ida, go with Ox to the river and fetch us some water. Hammerfist, make a stretcher out of some branches. Better get moving. [dogs barking] [shouting] - Those are Antoine's bloodhounds. We've got to get out of here, quick. - Antoine's men have reached the river. They've got a pack of dogs with them. - Come on, we're leaving. - You better get going with lion man, I'll hold them up here. - Good luck Altar my boy. Come on, hurry Hammerfist. ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] - Okay men, let's get them. [shouting] [hitting] - The broken bones will heal, but his hands will never be any good. - You're lucky to be alive. I don't need you. I want Solomon's other son. But now that I have you, he'll come. And then we'll all see how much your lion brother really loves you. - Don't worry you bastard. Even if he doesn't come for us you can be certain he'll get his revenge someday. [slaps] - Make an announcement everywhere. If lion man doesn't give himself up within three days the prisoners will be thrown to the lions. Take them to the courtyard and tie them up. Take them away! [suspenseful music] - Thank god for that, he has answered all our prayers. My boy, you've come back from the gates of death itself. - Altar. Ida. Ox and the other men. Where is my brother? Where is your daughter, Rhastim? Where are they? Where are they, Hammerfist? [drumming] - Antoine, king of Byzantium makes this decree. The hostages will die at dawn tomorrow. Unless lion man surrenders. Altar, son of Soloman. Ida, Rhastim's daughter. And all other prisoners will be thrown to the lions. - You're not strong enough yet. You must be patient. [suspenseful music] - Here is iron. Here is hammer, anvil. Here is the fire. Brother. You are a good blacksmith as well as a good doctor, aren't you? - I am. - Before sunrise tomorrow, make me two steel claws. Set them on the ends of these arms. Two steel claws, bigger and sharper than a lion's. [hammering] ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] [shouts] - [Man] You think lion man will come, your excellency? - [Antoine] I am sure he will. - Lion man will tear you to pieces, Antoine. - Well Simpson, what would you do if you got your hands on Antoine? - Cut his ears off, put them in his hand and stuff them up his you know what! [laughing] - Shut up you! [hitting] - Get off me you bastard! You bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Ba! [suspenseful music] - The time is up. Bring out the lions. [shouting] - Catch the dog! - Didn't I tell you he was raised on lion's milk? [shouting] [hitting] ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] - Catch him, soldiers! [shouting] - Soldiers, over here! [hitting] [shouting] ["Spartacus, Act I, Scene II - "'The Slave Market': Market Place" by Aram Khachaturian] [shouting] [hitting] - Come on, this way! [suspenseful music] [shouts] [shouting] - [All] Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!
