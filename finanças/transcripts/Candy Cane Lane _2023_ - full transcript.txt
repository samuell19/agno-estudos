Listen, sweetheart, I-I would be happy to call my old softball coach. No, Mom, I... I'm-I'm shattered that you don't want to go to USC. Wow. Joy. USC. Fight on. - Fight on, honey. - Fight on. Only a half hour away. You could spend so much time with Dad. That's right. It's only 20 minutes with no traffic. You could eat dinner with your family every night. Yeah. Nick, um, how did that math test go? You had a math test? What'd you get? I don't let grades define me, Dad. All right, that does not sound good. Yeah, that don't sound good at all. Look, Nick, if you want to win in life, you have to learn to focus on what's important. Well, my music is important. Math is required. Music is elective. Okay, but, sweetie, the-the music makes him happy. Yeah, but he ain't gonna make no money making music. Well, I mean, there's a lot of music people that make money, Chris. Not playing the tuba. Name one tuba player that's living his life like it's golden. Just one. Have you ever heard somebody in the band say, "And on tuba is," and they introduce him?

Aidan's school called. Apparently, compared to the other kids in his class, he is testing off the charts in math. You know, I saw an article online recently that said a lot of sociopaths were math prodigies. But not Aidan. Well, I don't know about you guys, but I'm so excited Candy Cane Lane is here. - Yeah. - The lights, the decorations, the goodwill between neighbors. I hear the competition is different this year. Hurry up, guys. It's about to start. This is Prism 1. Seeing the world through your eyes. Hi. I'm Emerson Turner. And I'm Kit Kleiman. That's-that's new. And we're hosting the Candy Cane Lane Spectacular live from beautiful El Segundo. Only on Prism Cable. Not only will there be music, merrymaking... And lights! But there will be high stakes as well, as the neighbors compete for best decorated house, and because of our sponsors... Wait, sponsor? We've never had a sponsor. What? $100,000. I'm sorry, what? Shut up! -My... $100,000? Join us all week as we cover the festivities, starting with our Santa's house lighting parade. And ending with our spectacular finale on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve! Christmas Eve is only three days away, so let the competition begin. Ho ho ho. - Are you thinking what I'm thinking? - Yeah. This was so fun. - I'm tired. - Thank you so much. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I can hook you up with more if you need it. That's my girl. What is all this? - What is this? - What do you mean, what is all that? You said to get a plan, so I got a plan. Okay. Hey, look, I know it looks like a lot, but I got to do something spectacular, something they've never seen before. - Okay, well... - This'll be... I was talking about a plan for after Christmas. Yes, like maybe update your LinkedIn, telling your vendors, letting people know you're back on the market. You know, we good, we good. - You know why? - Why? 'Cause I'm gonna win Candy Cane Lane. My love, I know that this is something that's so important to you, but I think that you need to consider the idea that you might not win. Well, I also might not not win. Okay, you know what? Let's go, guys. Come on. Let's go. - Let's go to school. - Yes. Get the show on the road. Hey, can you bring Holly to school today? I don't know if I can do that because I got a lot of stuff to do today. I'm really busy. I got to get a thousand icicles. - God, okay, well, I got to go to work. - Okay, touché. - Touché. - Okay, you're going to work. - You got it? - Okay. I will handle it. - Thank you. - Thank you, my love. - All right, I love you. - Love you, too. Bye-bye! Yeah, I'm not going to school, am I? Don't be ridiculous. Of course you're not. Already? You got to be freaking kidding me. But our decorations are handmade. They'll see how hard you worked. That's better than buying stuff. Hard work? Nobody cares anymore. And crap beats quality every time. Hard work. I'm sorry, you're old enough to know the truth. Whenever somebody says to you, "It's just business," then you're the one getting f... Fleeced. Fleeced. "Fleeced"? Fleeced, yes. Yeah, fleeced. You're the one getting fleeced. I got fleeced yesterday. And I did not like it. Who cares about craftsmanship or relationships? You spent your whole career developing. - Toss you out like cheap plastic... - Dad. Stop! Holly, look at this. Wow. This is unbelievable. - Wow. - This is amazing. Look at this detail here. - I know. - Look at this thing. It looks like... - Merry Christmas! - Sh... Hey. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Who am I kidding? Of course I did.

And if you don't know what I'm talking about, maybe you should ask Scott and Shelly what I'm talking about, 'cause I think they might know. Chris, we didn't do anything. We didn't do anything. Did you guys do anything? - No. - I did nothing. - Okay. - Stop looking at me like that, man. - My God. - Creeping me out, man.

All right, Tiny Tim, now Pepper's messing with my family. Blimey, that's what she does, guv. Goes after the people you love most, turns your whole life upside down. Well, it's not gonna work because I'm calling this off. This has to stop. Stop? You can't make it stop. You made your wish. You're in it now. Yeah. That's how she gets you, man. Tells you you can get a wish. Only you have to complete some crazy, stupid, impossible challenge. - Well, why me? - Why any of us? Because we took the bait. Anyone can make one mistake, and then you're cursed and no one can help you. She's evil but needy like a cat you bought and raised but hates your guts. Well, she sent me looking for gold, frankincense and myrrh. I mean, gold was easy, obviously. I have a ton of that at my house. But what even is that other stuff? I went to every Sephora I could find. I found plenty of Fenty but no myrrh. No myrrh! And she made me dress up as a New York City cop to rescue my estranged wife from a Japanese-owned high-rise being attacked by terrorists. What? Die Hard? That's not even a Christmas movie. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. It is the Christmas movie. - I literally cannot with you. - Well, I can with you. - You won't. - All right, then. Guv, we all failed. Now we're trapped in Christmas Village. Just like you'll be if you don't find those rings. Like I'll be? I'm not gonna get trapped in no Christmas Village. I didn't sign on for this. But you did. You literally signed on for this. Your receipt? There's, like, a bunch of fine print at the bottom. You didn't read it? Nobody reads the fine print. Come on, brother. You got to read the fine print, man. The terms of service are brutal. I know one thing: No elf is gonna shrink me down into some freaky Christmas person. Hey! - Well, I am freaky. - That's personal. Sorry. Sorry. 'Cause I'm going after those rings. - Whoa. Whoa! - Holy Sonic the Hedgehog. I'm already on my way. My God, he's doing it. He's really doing it! That's a good sign, guv. You only need three more. And if he gets all five... ♪ Five gold rings... ♪ Shut up! If you get all five, you can break the curse. And if he breaks the curse for himself... Maybe it breaks it for me! - All of us! All of us. - All of us, girl. I don't know nothing about no curse, and I don't know about no magic, but I do know one thing, that I ain't scared of no elf. - That's right, Chris. - That's right. You tell her. Yeah, too bad she not hearing you say it right to her face. ♪ One day of Christmas, I got a smartphone ♪ ♪ "Jingle All the Way" playing on my ringtone ♪ ♪ Second day of Christmas, I copped two pair of kicks... ♪ Dad, she's coming. ♪ 12 days, 12 days ♪ ♪ 12 days of Christmas ♪ ♪ It's the 12 days, 12 days... ♪ Dad, she's right outside! Okay, come on. Take us with you, guv. Help us, and we'll help you. - Okay, come on. All right. - Thank you so much. - Everybody, in. Come on. - Thank you, Chris, is it? Move it, move it, move it, move it. - Come on, man. Hurry up, man. - Is there a pub on the way? All right. See you never, Kringle's! Take that, Pepper! We're out of here! Hurry, hurry, hurry. Come on, come on. Be careful. My God, that's the sun, dawg. Hey! I'm outside! No! No, no, no, no, no! I can't live without you! I mean, I can, but who wants to try? - Easy, guv. - We all right? Right on my coccyx. Sorry for putting my butt on y'all. God! Good job, bonbon. Let me head up top. Whatever you do, don't peel out! This is amazing! So that's how you want to play? Game on. I'm the king of the... - I pulled a hammy. - Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa! Hey! That was fun. All right, just don't take any more turns like that. I don't know if I can take it! Two normal-size people driving down the street. Hello, neighbors. Hello, neighborhood. Is this a broker version of where we came from? I have motion sickness. Girl, don't throw up on me. At last, free from the torment of eternal Christma... Ew. I'm-a burn up everything in here. - Run! -Paper tidal wave! - Incoming! Hop it! Hop it! - My bustle! - My everything. You're quite the home decorator, Holly. What is this, some sort of butcher's chart? My God, it's Operation! Yo, I love Operation, dawg. I am flawless. I never get shocked. Watch this, y'all. Gary! - No. - S-Sweeney Todd! - My God, Gary, are you okay? - Do I look okay? Ay. Ay. Ay. Ay. I actually think it's an improvement. Hey, hold up. This is important. Dad, come on, seriously? Do you have any idea how bad that could've been? - I can explain. - And why were there chickens? Did you bring the chickens? No. Well, kinda, yeah. My God. This about the contest? Are you ki... Chr... Chris... You are supposed to be spending this time looking for a job. Why Dad looking for another job? Did you quit? You got fired? No, I got laid off. And I didn't want to tell you guys because I didn't want to ruin Christmas. But it's fine. It's fine. Seriously, fine. As long as I keep my job. I'm gonna show you guys something, and when I show you what I'm gonna show you, all your questions are gonna be answered. But when I show you this, don't freak out. - Come on. You got to see this. - Careful. Careful, you guys. - Holly, seriously? - What are you doing? What is happening? My God, look at this. What is this? - What am I looking at? - This is what I want you to see. ♪ Let nothing you dismay. ♪ Who's singing? They're singing. What? My God. Ooh, look at you, hot stuff, looking like a tall drink of water. - Gulp, gulp, baby. - Step back. Step back. - Step back. - What'd you just say about my mom? Hey, I know you see this fire between us, girl. - Is he talking to me? - Hey, watch it. - That's my wife. - For now, brother. I am so sorry. Hi. Um, nice to meet you. I can only apologize for Gary. He's the worst. She feel that heat, though. She feel that heat! That tree is feeling the heat! - God, watch it! The tree! - Hey. It's on fire. See, you're burning stuff down. Watch what you're doing, Gary. Yeah, it's kind of my thing, though. Woo-hoo! Check out the new whip, everybody. Someone order a cab? Pip! Hi-ho, cheerio, Holly. Okay, Chris... what are these? Hey, everybody, this is my wife Carol. - Hello. - ♪ Here we come a-caroling ♪ - ♪ Among the leaves so green. ♪ - No. Nope. That is weird. And-and this is my son Nick. ♪ Jolly old Saint Nicholas ♪ ♪ Lean your ear this way. ♪ And you guys remember Holly. ♪ The holly and the ivy. ♪ And this is my oldest daughter Joy. - ♪ Joy to the world. ♪ - Wow. Wait. Whoa. We're all named after Christmas stuff? - My God. - Seriously? Just now figuring this out? I have to admit that was my idea. - Yeah, it was all him. - I kind of talked Mom into that. He did. Chris, can I talk to you for a second? She's talking through gritted teeth. - You know what that means. - We can talk right now. Think we should do it a little privately. Just kind of step away for a second. Someone's in trouble. No, no one's in trouble. What are those and why are they talking? They're little Christmas people. Yes, I can tell, but that's insane. I mean, do you wind them up? Is there a battery? I don't got no battery, but you can check. No, there's no battery. They're-they're little Christmas people that have come to life. - It seems scary to me. - What's scary about it? They're talking and they're little, and that little one keeps flirting with me. Hey, I'm scary at first, baby, but... I'm telling you right now, you say one more thing, - I'm gonna flick you into next Christmas. - Ooh, girl. You smell good. You don't think this is amazing? No, it doesn't feel magical. It feels terrifying. Please don't touch that! Don't touch it. It's okay. They're... It's safe. You know what this is? This is Christmas magic. Well, I'm magic. I don't know what Gary is. - Mostly, like, gross. That's why I got to find three more rings before this clock chimes eight times on Christmas Eve. - Okay, so Popper... - Pepper. - Pepper. Pepper. - It's Pepper. -It's Pepper. Pepper will make your wish come true? Right, then I win. I win the contest, - and I get $100,000. - Right. Then this family has the best Christmas of all the Christmases ever. Except for the first one, which was obviously a biggie. That was special. Wait, so that was your wish? To win Candy Cane Lane? Not, like... I don't know... world peace? - End hunger? - End homelessness? - Stop climate change? - Save the polar bears? - New Drake album? - I love Drake. Me, too. Okay, point taken, but I wasn't thinking like that. I was thinking about my family. That's why I love him. But remember, if you fail... If you fail? What? If I fail, then I don't win. But we don't have to worry about that. 'Cause I'm gonna find those rings. - That's right. - Yeah. Hopefully. What you mean, "hopefully"? Stop being negative. All right. Stapler. Stapler! Somebody better find that stapler. Come on, guys, who used it last? Over here, you little piper. There you go. You little suckers. Gotcha. Right there, lady. There you go. All right. So, we got two rings. The first one is from... ♪ Two turtledoves ♪ Yep. And the second one is from the three... - ♪ Three French hens ♪ - I was gonna say it. Okay. And we also met... - ♪ Seven swans a-swimming ♪ - And the six geese a... ♪ Six geese a-laying ♪ That looks just like her. I'm-a burn her ass up. Firepit that ass. - Hey, Gary. No, no, no, no. - Yes. She going to hell. Gary, put the fire down. Aw. Question. So, Dad, Dad, who is this Pepper person? She some old girlfriend or something? 'Cause I met one of those before, and she was still mad. She's not wrong. No, no, she's not an old girlfriend. She's an elf. And she fights dirty, so we got a new house rule: Nobody can leave this house till Christmas Eve. - What? -What? -Wait, what? - Fine with me. - Dad, I got band. - You're gonna have to skip band. Okay, more importantly, I have a track meet, and a scout's gonna be there. Really? A scout? From USC? Yeah. Okay, we can't skip that. We're gonna all go to that together. I'll just have to keep you safe. Yeah, and we're gonna do this as a family. - We should split up. - What do you mean, we should split up? Have you ever watched a horror film? When you split up, somebody dies. That's true. Yeah, a Black person always die first, and all y'all Black. I've searched online, and no one has heard of this Pepper. I think we should wake up tomorrow morning and call the police. And tell them what? And tell them the truth, that some sadistic little elf is targeting our family. Yeah, I just said it out loud. It's not gonna work. I just got to find those damn rings. Can you please forget the rings, Chris? Seriously, just give the-the village back and all those little tiny figurines and say you're sorry for whatever you did to piss her off, and then be done with it. It's just not that simple, Carol. What are you not telling me? There's something you're not telling me. What are you not telling me? Carol, I just can't walk away. I have to. Okay. Okay, I hear you. - Okay? - Okay, yes. - All right. - We made a promise to each other. I'm glad you're saying this. I was about to remind you. - You were gonna remind me? - Before you said it. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay? - So... Yes, I'm gonna show up for you because we are on the same team - with each other. - Yes, because of this, we show up. - We show up for each other. - Right, we show up for each other. No matter how strange, no matter how crazy, we show up for each other. I don't think those were in the vows. I'm putting that in now. No matter how strange or how crazy, we support each other. -Okay. So I got your back. We're gonna get this done. - And that's why I love you so much. - I love you, too. Mwah. Give me another one. Ooh, I love both of y'all right now. How strange it 'bout to get? - No! No! - Hey. - No! Chris. - I'm-I'm-a handle him. Don't cup me, brother, not on the holiday. I'm gonna d-deal with our little friend, and I'll be back in a second. All right, you got the letter? - Yes. - Disarmed. Here we go. You're very brave, Holly. Thank you, Pip. I'm quite scared myself. You see, Pepper will never stop until she finds us. It's okay. We can protect each other. That's very kind of you, love. I'm just so tiny, you see. I am, too. Is that the mailbox? It is. We got this, love. Thank you, Pip. Well, and Bob's your uncle. I don't have an uncle. - It's an idiom, love. - What's that? A figure of speech. You ever hear of a writer called Charlie Dickens? No. My mother knew his mother. Yoo-hoo. Where are you, my naughty little stocking stuffers? Pip? Don't move. Don't even breathe. Cordelia? Lamp boy? My Santa. It's a slum. What a downgrade. Come out, my little villagers. It's me. Where are you? Hello? Please, no. I want to tell you a bedtime story. But you need to come out. Where are you? I'm starting to get angry. Feels like you're hiding on purpose. Well, look at this. Is that me? I'm stunning. All right, I'm leaving. Or am I? ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ How's that song go again?

No, that's not it either. Okay, girls, this is just a normal relay. Yeah, totally normal for a Notre Dame scout to be watching us. Joy, does your dad know? Hey, Joy! We see you! Look, just don't worry about him. I think those are those scouts from USC up there. - Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Take a look. See, right where... That's them, right? Is that them? - Yes? - Yeah. - Yes. It is? It is? - The middle one, the middle one. Hey! Yo! - Fight on! - Okay. My God. Whoo! Stop. Yeah. I'm getting sick of this. - Hello. - Squawk. Clock's ticking, naughty chicken. Polly doesn't just want a cracker. She's after all of you. No Carver is safe. No Carver is safe. What is that? Some prank call, like I don't have enough problems. - Sounds like a parrot. That's it. - The birds. -What? - Birds? The calling birds. - She's messing with us. - Okay. - What do we do? - Look, hey. Take these binoculars, look around the crowd. - You spot anything, say something. - On it. - You think she's here? - She could be. She could be anywhere. Hey. Hey, look at that. Nick, that's your math teacher. - No, it's not. - Mr. Benedetto. Hey. Hi. My God, sweetheart. Hey. He's probably excited 'cause you're doing so well in math, sweetheart. - Yeah, I'm doing, I'm doing good in music. - Yeah? He's coming to say congratulations. Hey! Hi there. - I see you. Hi. - Okay. Okay. - I'll be right there. - Hey. Where's Nick? - There she goes. There she goes. - Come on, Joy! - Come on. Come on, babe. - Come on, Joy! - Got a minute. - Come on, Joy! - I need to talk to you about Nick. - Smoke 'em, Joy! Yeah, you want to praise my boy. - Run, girl, run! - Come on, come on. - Whoo! - Praise your boy for failing my class? - Failing. He's not failing. - Come on, now! If he was failing, I would know he was failing. -Fight on! - Is he failing? - Whoo! - Yeah. Exponentially. - Who's failing? What? I don't know where Nick is. There you go. Need I say more? No, you should not. Sports. A topic I know nothing about. But I did my research last night, and I looked up some of the greatest sports icons of all time. The likes of... Wade Gretzky... and Tiger Wools. And of course the classic trio of Le, Bron and James. And the greatest of all time... Michael B. Jordan. And do you know what they would say if they were here right now? They would say this is not a game. We're not running in circles out here. We're not passing the baton. Life is about taking the baton and shoving it right up the competition's chimney! That was your cue. Go, go, go! Run! Ring. Milkmaid? Hi. Got milk? Hey!! Go. What the hell are you doing? You've got no drip. You have got to be kidding me. I'm coming, Joy! I got you! Hey, this doesn't count! Hey, man, what... All right, now, I ain't no punk. What? Hey! Why y'all messing with me? Y'all should be working for Cirque du Soleil. - Run, Joy! - I don't know if - you understand how important math is. - Run! Nine, ten. Mom, ten lords a-leaping. Joy. What are you doing? Why y'all dressed like Prince? Hey, Chris, the ring! You got to stop him! Math is at the heart of everything. It's vitally important. - Nick... - Listen to me, Friar Tuck. I need you to shut it! Stand by. Ha! Yes! Yes! What were you saying? I... I... That's right! I was about to start whipping everybody's ass up in here! Y'all got off easy this time! - Joy, that was amazing. That was amazing. - Thanks, Dad. You got it. You got the ring. - Are sure you're okay? - Yeah, I'm good, Mom. - You're okay. All right. - Thank you. Hey, there's that scout. Where? Wait, Dad, don't. Hey, how about that? Did you see that? Did you see what she did out there? Wasn't she amazing? Look, listen. It's not my policy to talk to parents, okay? Or an athlete at these events. I'm just here to observe. That's it. Well, consider yourself lucky. You got a chance to observe her. But did you see what she did? I did. I did. I counted, 20 violations and infractions. Well, I-I promise, - I don't usually run like this. - Yeah. Look, if she could run that fast with all those obstacles and hurdles coming at her, imagine how good she'll do in a USC uniform. I hope so. I do. 'Cause she's not running for us. Notre Dame? Nobody want to go to Notre Dame. Well, she's definitely not. What's going on? Holy cow! Holy... I don't want to talk about it. So you lied about how you're doing in math? It wasn't a lie. It was a spin. Yeah, now, how far you expect to get in life with an attitude like that? I don't know. I'm thinking president. Something big. Big things. - This boy. I can't. - Look. Only reason I didn't tell you I was a loser in math is 'cause I know how you feel about losers. And, Dad, just as a reminder, I can speak for myself. Excuse me. Don't you even try to make this about me. Okay? USC scout. That guy was from Notre Dame, and you knew it. Yes. Okay? I don't want to go to USC, okay? I-I don't want to come home for dinner every night. I want my own life, away from you. Hey. There is nothing wrong with that, but you need to be honest with your parents. Do you two even know how hard that I work so that you can have the best of everything, the best in life, the best Christmas? Everything that I do, I do for you. No, no, no. You do this for yourself. All this Christmas stuff, this isn't for us. Not anymore. It's all for you. You... yeah, y-you say that you want our help, but you really just want to do it yourself and then have us stand here and go, "Wow, isn't Dad so amazing? He's number one!" Hey. Okay, that's not helping anything. Hey. We. We do the work. - I know we do the work. - Okay, okay. Okay, but, you know, not right now. Look, everything you said out there was true. All right? I want to apologize for a lot of things. And I haven't told you the whole truth. If I find all the rings, I win. Yeah? But if I don't... then I get turned into one of them. - What? - Dad, what? My God, Christopher. Gary, you already knew that. I know. It's still a big reveal. Girl, I'm in the moment. - No. - Dad! Hey. What do you mean? You're gonna be one of those little guys? Forever? - Forever. - Why didn't you tell me? 'Cause I thought that I could, you know, fix this by myself. By yourself? My God, Chris. Now they gonna turn me into a little... - Don't cry. - I'm gonna be all tiny. I would break you. You're not gonna let her take my dad, are you, Pip? Not if I can help it, love. Little bonbon. I'm not crying. My eyes just sweat when I see something adorable. You know what I mean? No, sweetheart. No. Get up. Get up. We are not gonna let her turn your dad into one of those weird, old-timey Happy Meal toys. Not like... No offense. I'm sorry. - None taken. - A little taken. Mom is right. We're in this together. We're the Carvers. Yeah. You know what? We are a family. We will do this together because we are the Carvers. - We're the Carvers! - Yeah! Technically, you guys are not Carvers. Honorary members. On a temporary basis. Temporary honorary Carvers! Seriously? Hey, these tree creatures have to have the ring. Don't be so sure, guv. Pepper's not to be trusted. In fact, she was here last night looking for us. Wait, she was in my house? And she said you'd never find the last ring. - There's always some trick. - That's how she gets you. Right when the clock strikes 8:00 and you think you're about to win... You lose. But she also said something about, "Don't forget the nice gift maker." Yeah, and, "For the king of Christmas to save himself, he needs the one up on the shelf." "Up on the shelf"? What does, what does that mean? What does that mean? What? Seriously, you guys? Elf on the Shelf. - Duh.. - Elf. Yes. That's it. Elves make gifts. Pepper's the elf. - Pepper has the last ring. - Pepper has the last ring. Do you see this? How nice is it to have some help from your family? Yeah, it's good to have some help from your family. Right? And what you need is an operational manager, and that's all me. Follow your mother. I have ideas. Let's go. - Come on, you heard your mother. Let's go! - Yeah! What is she doing? She's in the zone. Okay. Okay. Okay! Listen up! Here's how it's gonna go down tonight. Village people, I want you right here, front and center. To do what? You're the bait. I liked when Chris was in charge. I mean, he wasn't effective, but I felt safer. No one asked you. Yeah, for once, I agree with Gary. Do you guys want to catch an elf or not? Don't answer it! Hey, listen here, you stupid birds. Let me tell you something right now. We are all coming for you 'cause you messed with the wrong family. - That's right. - So you better not ever... Nick, this is Mr. Benedetto. What the heck is going... That's the wrong number. Okay, listen up, guys. We are gonna need a pulley, plywood and string lights, lots and lots of string lights. Now you're speaking my love language. Hey, babe, do you think you can make a lasso out of string lights?

Well, I got the last ring. - Winner! - Yeah! I win! I win, win, win! Did you? All right, I get it. I got a lot to learn about Christmas. It's not about what you have on the outside of your house. It's about who you have inside with you. Yeah. And nothing compares to that. My God, if you do not stop humansplaining Christmas to me. What is that? Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.

Fudge me. You look great. What's your secret? Less cookies? Peppermint, what have you done? Well, I know how busy you get this time of year, so I thought I'd just teach a few people the true meaning of Christmas. The person that needs to learn a thing or two - is you! - What? Wow. Santa. - It's Santa, right? - Hello, Christopher. Yes, it's me. He knows your name. I'm... I'm really sorry about all this. No problem. Wow, you're actually really here. Hey, listen, Santa, um, I'm good, right? 'Cause I got all the five gold rings. - I never said five. - Yes, you did. "Before the old clock tower goes ding, you must collect the golden rings." There are five golden rings. Are there? Twelve. Dad, there's 12 partridges. Why? Why are there 12? No. - What? - That song "The Twelve Days of Christmas," it repeats. She always changes the rules. That's her trick. That's why no one ever wins. Is this a... some sort of pet entrance? You sing it over and over again, and every time you do, you add another one. 12 partridges! Why... why are we doing math right now? And two turtledoves. And then it repeats that verse. 11 times. So... so that means there's... 22 turtledoves! So it's not really five golden rings. It's 40. Forty. My God. He's right. How is Nick right? I don't know. It's... it's music. But it's math. I'm doing math. Is this what y'all call calculus? What? It's multiplication, you idiot. But you're right, for once. Wait a minute. 40 rings? I got you so good. All of you were like, "Five? Let's find the five." It was 40. Peppermint. Enough is enough. No. No, no, no, no, no. No, no. He made a deal. He signed it and everything. Look. See? Signed it right there. And there's nothing you can say or do because it's a deal. A deal is a deal! Well, there's a lot of fine print here. You can't expect someone to read all of this. Dear. I'm afraid she's got you. My God. Hey, wait a second, now. Wait a second, now. - You're Santa Claus, so you should be able - to veto this or something. - Yeah. Christopher, you signed the receipt. That's your name.

Hey, Santa, is there anything you can do to help them? No. No, they are mine. They made a deal, too, and they lost! - They lost! - You're right. They did. There's nothing I can do.
