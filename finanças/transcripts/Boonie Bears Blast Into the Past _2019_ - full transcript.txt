It's a baby boar. Oh, stay back! Stay back, please! Oh, my nose, watch it! What's it doing? Happy Chinese new year? It's the Year of the Pig. Oh yeah, oh yeah. This is a misunderstanding. Briar, any bright ideas? Yeah, just one. Run! Vick, where are we? Wooly Mammoth. Saber-toothed tiger. I think we're back in the prehistoric age! Visitors please, gather around. Today, we're visiting an important attraction here at Crystal Peak. Now, what you see here is 30,000-year-old cave paintings! 30,000 years? That's right! You heard correctly, 30,000! Mammoth, there isn't any left. Saber-tooth, gone as well! But what has survived though, are these rare, extraordinary works of cave art! - Hey! - Wow, yeah! That's great! As you may know, people of ancient times often worshiped the mysterious. And this is just one of their ancient idols! A bear? How's that a mystery? Ah, that's right. A mystery! And look over here! What is that? Okay, anybody recognize anything? A bike? Cavemen on bikes? You're jokin'! No! They were more intelligent than you realize! And look, there's more there. Behold! Go on, take a guess. What is that? A bucket? It's a hot-pot. This guy knows his food, hey? Now, What this means is the cooking technique originated right here! Wow, yeah! Why do you keep cheering? He's lying. What are you, some kind of shill? You call this ancient history? You probably painted it yourself! - I want a refund. - Stay! Please don't go away! A professional told me these were real. But the visitors, they just don't believe me. Oh well, lets pack up. What can I do to help? Oh? I'll put these power sockets away. Stop! Don't touch that. Let's see. Maybe this? Okay! Wait, no no. It's too sharp. Come over here. You could pack these up. Okay, I will! Wait! Actually, no. You're too clumsy. - Briar! - Step here. What? Don't move. Ah, perfect! Bramble, stay inside this circle, and don't go anywhere. You'll be doing me a huge favor! But! Sit in the circle. That's not a job. I'm so bored! Ooh! A butterfly! Huh? Bramble! What did I tell you? I was just following... Huh? Huh? It went in the wall! Briar, look! How did she do that? Bram, wait! Whoa! Huh? That's weird. Yeah, this is certainly odd. Where's our stuff? Huh? I put it right here. Where did it go? It doesn't make sense. Huh? Hey, hey, hey, the ladder's gone, too! What the... Bro, Vick! The painting. It's gone too. Oh, what's going on? No signal, no WiFi. Oh! C'mon, c'mon. Come on, pick up! Vick, Vick. I'm on the phone. What is it? Look. Is this Pine Tree Mountain? Bro, what happened to the forest? Strange. Something's very wrong here. Let's get back to the cave. Is that a ruby? Vick, come back! Briar! There's so many! Look at the size of them! I must be dreaming! Wow, finally, I'm gonna be rich! Oh, I've been dreaming of this moment. It's the day that my dreams do come true! I'll be the richest man in Pine Tree Mountain! Hey, You're drooling. Wake up! Huh? Let's go. This place isn't right. Hey, no way! Not without my rubies! No! Vick! Vick! Come on, let's go! Time to get back to the cave. Get your hands off my backpack! Huh? They're just turtles. Hey, look at them. I bet they're really slow. Huh? Are you kidding me? How can something that looks so slow, run so fast? We're surrounded by rhinos. What are we gonna do? Don't worry. We can sneak our way back. Bramble, can you stop moving around? You're crushing me. But my tummy doesn't feeling well. Cut it out, you two! Vick, Briar, I'm sorry! Come on, Bramble! Are you trying to kill us? Bramble, what did you eat last night? Last night? I had a sweet potatoes. Fellas! You've already had your dinner! We're the dessert! Whoa! I wonder why they stopped? They don't want desert? Forget it, come on. Lets just get out of here. Huh? I think I know why they ran. No! Briar! Huh? Hey, Big guy! Wanna team up? - What? - Team up! Lucky for you, I need a partner. Look at you with your big belly and short legs. You won't last long out here. You need someone to watch your back. Whoa, wait a minute! Who are you? You don't know me? Geez, you really are new! Listen up, best hunter in the forest! Never run from a fight. The biggest bully of the mountain. Tear up my prey? No sweat! Warrior of the pack, Feifei! This kid has lost her mind. Okay, we're done here. We should go now. The Courage Fruit is waiting! What Courage Fruit? Huh? You don't know? The Courage Fruit up there! Oh, oh great. Okay! Well, let's make a deal then. If you help me get the fruit, then I'll make sure no one dares to lay a finger on you. Huh? I need to go find Bramble and Vick. Hey, don't go! I'm not finished! You scared the heck out of me! Well, how about Team Wolf-Bear? Stop following me. I don't have time for games. Hey! Wait, wait, wait! I'm serious! Go away, get! I need to find my friends. You mean the hairless monkey and the clumsy bear? Huh? You saw them? They fell right to their doom. Thanks! You're friends are gone. You can help me get the fruit! You and I, we can make a great team! I don't want to be your partner. Stop following me! Wow! You're really scary! Back off! Hey! Big bear! A little grumpy though. I wonder how Bramble and Vick are doing. Vick! What on Earth is chasing us? I have no idea! This is getting weird. Don't eat us! Don't eat us, please! Briar, where are you? Worm, worm, worm! Huh? Men are useless. ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ Huh? Me? ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la ♪ Hi, I'm Bramble. Huh? Relax, he doesn't bite. You again? He's the guardian of the bamboo forest. But all he does is sleep. Well then, looking for the exit? There. Thank you very much, but I already saw it. See you! Like I'd ever be lost in a forest. Get real. Huh? Tiny little Pandas? What's so funny? Huh? Why am I going backwards? Whoa, whoa! Get off, get off! Let go! Oh? Welcome back. You change your mind? Hey you little black-and-white puffballs! What do you want? They pretty much run this place. They're the only ones out here really. At least they were, until you came along. And look, they just love you! Huh? Are you kidding me? I don't have time to play with you kids. Go away! Huh? Look, what's that? Hey, big bear! Team up with me. I'll get you out of here and help find your friends, and you help me get that fruit. Team Wolf-Bear. What do you say? Shake on it? Come on! You're running out of time. Aren't your friends waiting for you to save them? Ah, big hero. It's just a paw shake. Real easy, come on. Hey, you better keep your word. Of course I will. Ah. Hey, snap out of it! Now's our chance, we gotta go! Yeah. Huh? Woah. Lin's back! Hey everybody, Lin's back! Stone, I brought meat. Fresh meat! Huh? Hi Dug. Not very tasty. Prepare the meat! Come and Get it! Vick. By tomorrow, there'll be nothing left but our bones! Bramble, don't panic. We'll just wait 'til they fall asleep, okay? And then we just sneak away. Oh, good idea! We're out of meat! Huh? Roast them! I've been eating barbecue for years, but I never thought I'd become one. Oh please, please, let us go. I'm not that tasty, after all! I'm just a skinny little guy! Meat, meat, meat! Meat, meat! With scallions, and pinch of garlic. Let us go! I'll show you where all the best honey spots are! Vick, what's happening? I seriously have no idea! Clear out! Run for your lives! Wait, don't go! Untie us first! You can't just leave us here! Holy moly! Look at that girl go! Hey Vick, what are you waiting for? We need to get out of here. Oh! Lets go, lets go! Oh! I'm stuck! Get up quick! Bramble, give me a hand here! Help me, come on! Vick, just run! Bramble, I'm stuck here! Vick, hurry! Come on, Vick, run, run! Yeah! Vick, we escaped from that awful place! This doesn't seem better. Vick, Vick, where are you! Vick? - Lin! - Lin! Stone, what just happened? It was him! That guy, he saved you. Vick! I'm here to save you! Whoa! Oh please, please... The sacred mountain has shown us a sign. Two saviors, sent from above! Huh? Behold their extraordinary powers! Look! The spirit of beast trapped inside the sacred box. Look carefully! They are saviors sent to us from the heavens! Protect and save us! Does this mean they won't eat us? Even better, I think they're gonna feed us. This forest is really dangerous. So stay alert! Or we can end up as someones dinner! I grew up in this forest. It's my home. I'll be fine. Oh, you'll be fine alright. Just follow me. Careful! Don't pick that! Huh? Wouldn't do that! Bad idea! Don't sit there! Nope! No! No! No! Can I at least rest here? As a matter of fact, not really. That rascal! What a pain in my neck! She is wasting my time! Just wait and see. I'll show her not to mess with Briar. Now you see how tough I really am? And now I'm gonna eat you up! Huh? Hey, hey are you okay? Huh? Feifei, you haven't changed one bit! What are you doing here? Why, we're just passing by. We came to see if our dear friend Feifei has the Courage Fruit yet. I'm not the same old Feifei. I'm much stronger now! I almost believed that. You're joking, right? You don't even have the courage to eat your prey. She's no wolf. Yeah! Well, Feifei, they've got a point. Here. Eat it, and we will accept you as one of us, right guys? What do you say? Huh? Whats wrong? You scared? Of course she is! Look at her, she's a coward. I'm not scared! I'll eat it right now! It stinks. This isn't even fresh! I'm not getting sick to prove a point. You liar! She's just afraid! You're just making excuses. Cowards like you bring nothing but shame to the wolf pack! Hey, you little scoundrels! Get out out of here! Get away from her, you hear me? Get lost, go! Feifei! Here, while it's hot. Big bear, I'm sorry. I lied to you. I'm not the toughest in the forest. I'm just a coward. Every time I catch my own prey, I just feel sorry for it and let it go. I feel like don't belong in the pack. So that's why you want the, what's it called? Courage Fruit. What? It's called Courage Fruit! Oh. The others say I'll never make it. But I'll show them. I, Feifei, will be full of courage! Big bear, come here! Hurry! Tough kid. She recovered quick. The Courage Fruit is the most magical thing in the forest. Eat it, and you'll become super brave. Come on, big bear. Look! The Courage Fruit is right up there, on that tree! Oh! They say the giant bird, Dooma, is so strong because he's eaten the fruit. He's always guarding that tree so he can keep all the Courage Fruit to himself. After I eat the Courage Fruit, I'll become a true warrior of the wolf pack. I know I can do it. Brother. Let's go, big bear. We'll reach the human village by tomorrow. Right. Big bear, where do you come from? Me? I'm from 2019. 2019? What kind of place is that? It's a place full of human beings. Oh. Then our place is way more exciting than yours. And more dangerous! Big bear, there's a bee hive! I got it! Ha! Team Wolf-Bear! Yeah! Did you hear that? Stop! Don't worry kid. I'm on your side. Oh no. They're fighting, this isn't good. Worthless fools! King! If you can't even catch a child. What good are you? Someone got in our way. Remove the nosy bear! I thought you were a useless coward. It turns out you're a traitor as well. Move! Attack! Briar! Briar, Briar! Briar! Bramble, Vick! Briar! Bro! We were so worried! That's for sure! Me too! I'm glad you're safe! Lin, no! Lin, don't kill her! Stone, move aside! She's a wolf! Have you forgotten how your father was? She saved my life! When she recovers, you send her away. Feifei! Feifei! Are you alright? So who is this little dog? She's so cute! You promised to help her find some Courage Fruit? Yeah. And in return she brought me here. The wound's not too bad. She'll be alright in a few days. I don't think we can go back home yet. But, bro, do you even know how to go back? The butterfly cave brought us here, so it should lead us right back out. Right. Well then, since we can't go back. Come, let me show you guys something. You're gonna love it! Yeah? Okay. Music! Let's dance! Fetch the stick. Okay, go! Crispy bread! Fireworks! And this is how you use chopsticks. Huh? They're gonna love hot pot! - Hot pot! - Hot pot! This here is a shadow play! Honey is edible. Huh? The battery's dead! The what? Maybe it's tasty? It's dead! There's no more songs, no dances, no videos, and no more selfies! What are we to do? What are we gonna do? No songs! No dances! No videos! It's just the same! I've been away for so long. What if mom and dad tried calling. I bought this for Dad's birthday. But I still haven't sent it to him. I miss my mom and dad! I just remembered. I miss my all buddies, Tiki, Babu, and my honey jar! Briarshall we go to Courage Cliff? Yeah. And after that, we're going home. Bramble, Vick, let's go! Let's do it! Bramble, maybe you should join Team Wolf-bear. Thanks, but no thanks. I still think Puppy-Bear is more accurate. Puppy-Bear? I like it! Hey Vick, maybe we should come up with a team of our own? I don't think that's happening. Huh? Bramble! Come on, keep up! I'm Coming! You've certainly learned new things while away from the pack. You learned to get along with humans. Have you forgotten that you're a wolf? I haven't. You're the reason your brother is dead. You'd do the same to us! Yes. The savages will always be our enemies. The vendetta between wolves and humans runs deep. We almost wiped them out once. We wolves should rule the forest! But those bears, they've ruined our plans again and again! We must eliminate them! But the bears, they're my friends. Silence! Here's a task. Tomorrow, bring them to the Valley. And there I'll be waiting. Briar, what's so special about this Courage Fruit? How's it different from any fruits I've eaten? Bramble, were in prehistoric times. Things here are very different from what were used to. By different, you mean difficult. I'm turning into beef jerky in this weather. Let's squeeze some juice out of the Courage Fruit. What do you think? If you want some of the Courage Fruit then you need to ask for Feifei's permission first. King, they're about to reach the Valley. Vick? - What's wrong with you? - Briar, stop him! All right. Knock it off, you two. Come back here! Whoa! Boss! King! King! We got a problem! The girl, she took off with our prey! What? What? King, that girl tricked you! Feifei, you traitor! This isn't over! Feifei, thank you. After we get the fruit, you guys should hurry home. Before King gets you. What'll King do to you, once were gone? Hey! Don't worry about me. Once we get that fruit, I'll be as strong as the Dooma! I'll become a true warrior of the wolf pack! Briar! You guys are gonna need to hurry! This reminds me of my time in the circus. Briar, quick! Feifei? The Courage Fruit. Where's the Courage Fruit? Where is it, where is it? But why? Oh, I know! This is the Courage Fruit. I can't believe it's so big. Right, Briar? Hey, hey, hey! Feifei, stop it! Stop! These aren't Courage Fruits! Those are Dooma's eggs! Feifei, there is no Courage Fruit. No! You're lying! Why are you lying? I have to become brave! Hunter, I'm sorry. I feel so useless. I'm such a coward. What can I do to be brave like you? Silly girl, you're not a coward. One day, you'll know how brave you really are. Feifei! Hunter! Briar, what do I do to become brave? How to become brave? When we were both small, Bramble and I. One day, our mom vanished. Momma! Momma! Momma! Momma! Where are you? Don't you want us anymore? I was scared, and I didn't know what to do. But when I looked at Bramble. Bro, don't cry! No, us bears are tough! Briar, I'm scared. It's alright. Don't cry, bro. You still have me. I'll always protect you. Briar. I'd do anything for Bramble. For my brother, I have to stay brave. His happiness means everything to me. I truly believe, your brother felt the same way about you. One day you'll know how brave you are. And Feifei, I don't think that... What? That's bad. The volcano, its active! Briar! Briar! Hurry, we need to go now! Coming! Briar! The Butterfly Cave, it's just up ahead. It's time for us to say goodbye. Hey, big Bear, take care of yourself. You take care, okay. Huh? How far away is the Butterfly Cave? Just keep running! Okay! This way! Wait! King, please, just let them go. You can do anything to me. Just let them leave. Let them go? You gotta be kidding! How dare you! Pleading with us like that? You are useless without our pack. Look at you. No part of you looks like a wolf. You're dead to us. Ain't that right, King? Boss? You would stand there sniveling between me and my prey? Hey, stop! Don't beg him, it's useless. Feifei, why did you come back here? Because you're my friends. I'm here to help you. Briar. Huh? Stone! What are you doing here? Lin thought you'd be hungry, so I brought you some food. You alone? No! Dug, watch out! Whoa, whoa! Get away from my Bro! That's right, he's with us! And now a little taste of the 21st century. Huzzah! Cover me! Its time to get promoted! Huh? Hey! Yay! Yeah! Quick, hurry! Quick, jump! Briar! What are we gonna do, bro? We've gotta save them! Hey, I've got an idea, guys! All we have to do is cut down a tree! A tree? Yeah! How dare you you bring up logging at a time like this? No, no, no! That's not what I mean at all! We have to cut that down to make a bridge. Oh right! Vick, you're so smart! I'll hold them off. You two cut down that tree! Briar, right behind you! Catch! Wait! Some of us are still over there! I've been doing this for years! Yeah, and normally I'd be trying to stop you! Good job, Bramble. I'll make a logger of you yet! Yeah, real funny! All right! Lin, we're gonna be okay! Huh? Time to get promoted! - Stop! - You little traitor! Wait, some of us are still trapped there. We need to save them first. Almost done! Feifei, watch out! Look at the sky! Feifei! Uh-oh. Oh no, Vick! Bramble! Watch out! Vick! You okay? King, King! We've got wolves trapped there! They'll be remembered. But boss! Briar! King? You traitor! You. You were born a wolf. Yet, you refuse to hunt and you're unable to kill. You're good for nothing and you don't deserve to live! Feifei! Watch now as your friends die in front of you, one by one. And you can do nothing about it! Because deep down inside you know what you are. Little worthless coward! Hunter! Feifei! Don't listen to him! You're the bravest friend I know! You're right. I'm no good at hunting, and I won't kill. But I know I have to protect my friends! One day, you'll know how brave you really are. No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not a coward! Quick, stop her! Let's go! Now go! Get them! Vick! Briar! Briar! This way! Catch! Feifei! Time to end it! Over my dead body. Feifei! Briar! Do it now! Hurry, get across! Feifei, thank you. You saved us all. You are a true warrior! Feifei. You're the bravest friend I've ever had! Briar! Huh? Seriously? A tough guy like you crying? Feifei? Feifei's alive!? She's alive! Promise me that you'll all eat well and sleep well while I'm away. Huh? Have I seen that guy before? Vick, I want to thank you for helping me find true love! Ah, Lin. Vick, that coulda been you. You're gonna be single forever! Do I look like I have trouble with women? Yeah. Oh. Huh? Wow! Isn't that the butterfly from the cave? Follow the butterfly, and we can go back. Oh, Right! Follow the butterfly! Feifei, I'm worried that... Briar, don't worry about me. No one can hurt me anymore. Besides, I'm around Stone, Lin, and the rest of their human friends! So, so. Briar, I want to let you know. That courage fruit I was looking for, it was you. Does this mean you're gonna bite me? That's right! Briar! Come on, we have to go! We have to go! I have to go.
