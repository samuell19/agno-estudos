[♪] The Tormentor... ...I was. An experimental substance he built to accurately modify human behavior. Administered in the proper ratios, it can induce catastrophic psychosis. By unlocking the deepest impulses of the subconscious mind. For the two rival super powers, the project represented the future of warfare. With the human mind as the battlefield. But the future power of psycho-power research were so devastatingly... ...That all scientist were hungry to poses it's secrets. [foreign language] Good. I'm in town, I've got the product. Yes, I'll meet you at exactly an half hour... ... at the the Maria Hilton. you growl... ...that a revolutions is like a wild animal. that it must never be tame, or it will die. [Laughs] You have a way with words Liams. But yourself, you're scared. To tame the trigger. I'm scared of KGB using us. I believe in something bigger then world politics. Everything is politics. You want the guns right? Yeah. Well you've got to have friends to get something like that. A Boris, your friends look like scared university protestors. which one is Liams? Me. Liams, your vermin partly writings have reached many important ears. I would not call them partly writings. I believe in them. You are a typical pompous gutter philosopher. Just remember who supports and tolerates you. Idealist like that can never be controlled. You know what to do. [foreign language.] Tell them to hurry up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Ak47s. Oh yeah. 76's. M16, American Army based. [foreign language] Quiet. Shh. [foreign language continues] Yatsko. Yatsko. [gunfire] Go, I'll cover you. [screams] Alright. What happened to Liams? Inside. They got him. Come on let's go. [♪] [cows mooing] [crowd cheers] Oh Sam! Sam! How you doing? How you Mr. Mayor? Hey come on let me sell you this car here. Come on, I've got three more payments left on my pick-up. And she does me just fine. Well let me sell you one of last year's then. uh- It's quite alright. I'm going down to Flo's, and getting myself a cup of coffee. - Take care. - Okay. I'll see you. You have a nice day, up there at that lab. And you do everything them scientist tell you. Alright honey. Bye. Be a good boy now. Thanks mom. [♪] Well hi, morning Sam. Morning Flo. How's the chicken? - Well not to bad. - Yeah? How about a cup of that coffee of yours? Ah you bet. So how's that boy of yours? Staying out of trouble? Oh stew's taken a job in science up at the research center. Really? Well that's great and all, But I don't like what's going on up there. Not one bit. - Oh Same. - Oh don't "Oh Sam" me. you know Ben Colton has been pulling out dead fish from the reservoir, don't you? Everyday... ...they've been finding dead deer down by the end land. Must be drinking that damn lab done crapped in our water. I don't know anything about dead deer. but my boy is helping out the army. Aw Flo, I'm a Vietnam vet. Don't you talk to me about duty. Them scientist are playing God up there. And they're doing it in our valley. hey professor [knocking on table] Mr. Professor. Tell me something. Why are those deer dying? I mean what the fuck are you guys doing up there. what we're doing up there is science. Shit. I understand you're concerned, really I do. You've raised some serious issues. Damn serious issues. Issues that need to be answered. the group leaders are concerned about... ...well a lack of communication between the town's people and us "mad scientist." Listen tomorrow afternoon... ...we're having an open house. I'd like you to come, I'd like all of you to come. Okay? But come armed with serious questions? You mealy mouthed worm. you said some inspiring things. a fiery statement. A fine protector of the worker. Jesus H. Christ. Too many weirdos around here today, eh Flo? Miss come here. [♪] [laughs] What, they pay eleven dollars an hour for this? Shouldn't be that much. That's why I feel guilt. No really. Ssh. Come on. Hand me that. Come on. The Bag. Come on. Excuse me this facility is off limits to the... [gunshot] Hello. Hello. Yes you. Come along now. Shut up and move. Quick. Sorry this is a restricted area. Yeah, we understand. Hey. Young man this is a restricted area. Shut up. Shut up. Boris, I have Dr. Clovis here. Hello doctor. You look much younger close up. I know you. You're lecture in Paris made you very well known to some new people. But I still have some questions left to ask. Like the effect of the chemical extract on the hypothalamus? But first... ...You must tell me where the chemical is, and how do you put it into it's volatile state. How the hell do you use it! I- I can't. I don't know what you're talking about. You will tell me. What are you doing? Okay George you should take this. It's line one. Who is it? A guy says he's a terrorist, and I think he's for real. Come on, Terrorist? For real? Go for it. Hello. Yeah who is this? We've taken control of the army's illegal germ warfare lab here in Farmdale. Okay. They manufacture germs and viruses here. Yeah uh- Talk to the world. The world will know the truth. Yeah we're ready to listen. We'll send someone right to you. We'll send somebody- [gunshots] They're shooting at me. Chief, I'm at the lab. I'm taking fire, I need some help. Taking fire? I'll send a car up there. Nah chief you don't get it. I need some big time help here. Okay roger that Bob, hang in there. Don't hang up. Don't hang up. Ah hell. Send Lisa Barbell up to that lab. For Christ sake sit down, there's no time for this bullshit. We just went into event status less then five minutes ago. Yes sir. President is shitting a bolder waiting for us to clear up this fucking mess. Spooks in that lab where working on something rather sensitive. What I need right now is information. Call up all available data banks. Yes. I want a blueprint of that lab. Profile on the terrorist ad last of all, all available forces. Yes sir. You have lab surveillance cameras up? No sir. And outside video link is down, Sir. What do you mean down? Uh sir we're trying to bring them back online from here. I have to know what is going on in that lab. I know sir. How do the chemicals become volatile? It's only toxic as a gas. Go on! When the catalytic chamber builds up enough pressure then you got your reaction. Ratio! What's the ratio? We don't know yet. - Talk to me. - Wait Boris. There's an army officer outside. They're prepared to listen to us. This is it! Go back find the chemical, then come back, then talk to me. This is a political mission, why does a chemical matter to you now? I have no time for this bullshit right now. Find the chemical. First thing first. Go. Move! Where is it? As you all know this is a military bio-research center which manufactures extremely dangerous materials. Right now we must consider the terrorist threat as real. Any contamination from this facility, could have serious and far reaching effects. On domestic or world opinion. A fact which the soviets are all to well aware of. In short, this is a potential political nightmare. Presidents position must be protected at all cause. Sir, we're intercepting a microwave transition. One of the news channels. Put it on monitor. Yes sir. Sir why have you taken over one of the world largest peace time laboratories? For the last ten years, this facility... has been conducting germ warfare experiments for the army. Who are your superiors? Right now I'm in control of this facility. And if my demands are not met within twenty-four hours, all of North America is going to be contaminated with this drug. The germ warfare violates the terms of Geneva Conventions. And I hope now people... How did that reporter get in there? I don't know, look it's not going to happen again. I'll have her extracted. See that you do. What do they do? Okay, so who are the Gay crasher? Sir they are a splinter group of "Red December." a West German peace activist movement. They used to spend a lot of money trying to discredit NATO research. But they remained harmless. Sources tell us that their main voice... ...Kurt Liams, was shot and killed two weeks ago. Clearing the way for a takeover by this man. Boris Otlaff. KGB put their own man in. Certainly seems that way. He and Liams were known to have different views on how far to push their message. Okay. So now we know we've got a wild card. Our friend Boris could be KGB. Or could be just some poor dumb ass hole trying to take a punch at Uncle Sam. In any case, he's given us twenty-four hours. [♪] [police sirens] Captain Barton, United States Marine Core. This area is now under Marshall Law. Thank you very much for your help. It's the governments problem now. No more reporters in the area. Sir- We don't need anymore fucking reporters! Sergeant! Sir! [phone ring] Yes sir I have put a cap on this situation. I have the perimeter well under control. Who do we have on deck. I've got Delta force deployed at McGuire. And I understand you put them on standby. Are we anticipating a change in personnel? I'm not letting Delta charge in there without hand picking the C.O. Myself. Elliot is a good man. Hell he was appointed by the president. Elliot is a psychopath. Which actually doesn't disqualify him from this job by any means. Unfortunately my choices are limited. If the terrorist release the substance, I need someone who will survive in the contaminated environment... ...long enough till we can get in there. Terminate the enemy. Clean up this fucking mess. What do you mean survive? The substance is a hostile pathogen. It usually lethal, but... ...certain physiological profiles offer some resistance. Has to do with something with the blood. Well who do we have to match this profile? On active or reserve status, no one. I'm reactivating an old war horse. Who? Conn. Bone Conn. You have to be kidding. Sir is that him? Yeah. [screaming] You wanna fuck around man. Pick him the fuck up. Prop him up, watch this. Alright Bone. [whistling & cheering] Bone . Bone. Enough of this. Come on, we're gonna get you cleaned up. [♪] Jesus Christ Charles how the fuck did you find me here. A very thorough search of skid row. Didn't you tell them I'm not interested? Hey you know it doesn't work that way. Charlie what's all the fuss about? I'm retired. Come on you're not retired. You're not retired until they say you're retired. Yeah, I heard that. What's the mission? Well if you ask me, the shit really hit the fan. What's so fucking important that they had to drag me out of the gutter? Hey figure it out. They have a dirty job, and they need someone whose got nothing to lose. Who took over for me? Phil Elliot. Phil Elliot? Something ain't right with you. He enjoys killing too much. Some people can say the same about you. This is Captain Bartley of the United States Marine Core. Hurry up captain. You have exactly fourteen hours. We're doing all we can on this end. Are there any hostages? Yes. Of course I have hostages. Are there any casualties and is anyone hurt? They're not harm yet. But if my demands are not met, they will be. We are doing everything we can, yes? Hurry up Captain Bartley! Please calm down. Don't tell me to calm down, just hurry. None of the surveillance cameras are on? No sir, the video link is down. How much time are we talking about? Well sir we're trying to bring it back online from here. You realize we have to know what's going on in the lab? Deploy a video drone. Yes sir. Sir I think we should be online in a second here. There it is. It's about time. Who is this guy? That would be Boris Otlaff. Get me Captain Bartley. Yes sir. Yes sir. Captain Bartley, are you in communication with the terrorist? Communication links have been set up, yes sir. You talk to the man? Yes sir. Does he seem rational? He knows what he's doing, yes sir. Well what do you make of his demands? I don't know about his demands sir, I don't know what to make of his demands. He sounds like a pro. Look, secure the perimeter. I'm upgrading this to a level two emergency. I'm sending in the Delta force. Yes sir. [radio] Captain Bartley. Lieutenant Elliot sir. Delta Force. I'd like to know what our orders are sir. Lieutenant your orders are to take a stand down position. Take out of the perimeter and wait further orders. [laughs] We're not here for the picnic. We have a precision tactical time frame sir. I'd like to know what our orders are. Lieutenant are you in the armed forces? Sir is that a statement or question? Lieutenant there is a chain of command here. You will take your orders as I take mine. You're Lieutenant I am a Captain. You're orders are to take your man and place them at the perimeter. Please do so, thank you Lieutenant. Sir if you don't mind, Sir, I'll wait for my orders from my immediate superior, sir. Thank you. Sergeant! [♪] [sirens] Does everybody know their fire mission? We've got four exposures. Angel? I've got the roof boss. Pete? Yeah, second floor north-west wing. Good lets make it clean. Bone Conn. What bring you out of the woodwork? Coming by to see how we do thing around here now? I'm assuming command here. By who's orders? This is presidential. I hoped you wouldn't be hard about it. Lets just be professional, okay Elliot? Well that's great. What do you know about our timing? What do you know about my men? Elliot, I trained these men. Angel, Pete. Where Reynolds? He bought it, a year ago. Where were you? This conversation is coming to a end now. We're going in there and we're doing everybody. Not this time. This is political. We're taking prisoners, those are my orders, got it? Okay, I'll follow you in, but once the mission is complete and everything is secured... ...don't count on me for anything. Sir I think he made it into the restricted lab. Sir I think I can I.D the substance he's holding. Yes sir that is the viral distillery. It clearly appears he knows what he's doing. I don't know how he would have gotten the ratios. What do you make of his demands? Sir I think the ass hole is going to do it. Precisely. His demands are bullshit. Red hearing. He's going to stall us until he can figure out a way to release the substance. He's going to blow it as soon as he can. He's not going to give us twenty-four hours. No sir. Get me Captain Bartley. Alright. Gentlemen, clear the room. As of right now, this area is strictly off limits to all but secure personnel. Move, lets go. Got Bartley on the line. Preparing for you mission? Who the fuck are you? I'm Lisa Barbell. I'm a reporter. Great. What unit are you with. With Dealt Force. I've got nothing to say to any reporter. Look this is off the record. Obviously something is bothering you... ...to make you drink that rotten gut. Something bothering me? Fuck right something is bothering me. I'm retired. All set to live in obscurity. Drink myself into oblivion. I get called up for this mission. I have no idea why. Do you know what's really going on out there? Like I said, I have no idea. But I don't like it. Captain Bartley. Yes sir. It's almost first light. I'm giving Delta Force to go ahead. I'm ordering you to implement the bio-hazard plan. Yes sir. I want your troops out of there. Yes sir my men will move out at dawn. Bartley. Are you in complete understanding of this order? I understand the situation completely. Right. Yes sir. [♪] Okay can we go over this again, what exactly are your demands? You know my demands very well. Twenty-four hours ago you had twenty-four hours. Now you have only twelve hours left. You're not harming the hostages in anyway are you? I must have your assurance of that. Keep talking to him. Delta is making their initial infiltration. Stall him. Keep it light. Okay. Alright, which political prisoners do you want released? All the political prisoners in NATO prisons. Twelve hours. That's all you got. Hey listen I've got no time to talk to you anymore. I got to go. But maybe we'll have lunch someday soon. - What? - Lets do that. Twelve hours. Hello? Hello, pick up the phone. Hello? I think he's off the line. It's all up to delta now. Don't move! Don't even breath. Elliot take this man, find Pete and Angel and meet me in the operating room. You got that? That's a direct order. What? Why are you wasting your time with this guy anyway? What about Boris? [gunfire] Sir it looks like he's using an ultra-sonic detonating device. Christ, why didn't we think of that? Sir it looks like he prepping for an aerosol detonation. In that form the substance can reach a catastrophic concentration almost instantaneously. That's precisely the point. He designed this viral agent so that one part per minute in the atmosphere can infect an entire population. Where'd you get these guys? Upper level. Alright. Nice job, move out. Move out. What are you going to do with them? Come on move up, I'll take care of it Angel. Come on move out. Don't go anywhere guys. [gunfire] Freeze! I wouldn't if I were you. Put it down. Lucky today? That's it. Sir I don't know what's going to happened. I mean detonating this thing has only been a theoretical model up until now. Sir it's reaching it's theoretical catalytic state. Detonation is immanent sir. I repeat detonation is immanent. Fuck! What the fuck is going on? Mask! He found a way to catalyze it. In aerosol form. [coughing] [♪] Phase one. I've been exposed to the chemical. Let go. Yeah? Let go of me. Yeah? You got me, but you'll never stop the movement . Tell someone else, I don't give a shit. Elliot take this prisoner. Elliot take the prisoner. I'm calling command in control and getting someone on the horn here. What the hell is wrong with you guys? Something wasn't right in there. You guy inhale tear gas? It wasn't tear gas. Get your knees to the floor. Pete! Angel! [♪] Sir. On sight instrumentation confirms on widespread exposure. So it's begun. What are our options? We have none. The situation call for drastic measures. We have to quarantine the town. Cut them off, and sterilize the whole area. And detain the entire population. Sir that's impossible. I mean, The Alfa exposure zone alone is an entire map grid. Two-hounded square miles with a mountain range running straight through it. That could take three companies of National Guard. We have to catch this quickly, before the panic starts. Believe it or not, we actually ran a war plan simulation of this. Can use the guard or the regular army, no time for call out. Besides we can't risk uncertain loyalties. They might have relatives in there. Who can we use? The emergency response team. That's only a reinforced platoon. I know. They'll do exactly as they're told. I want to know what's going on here. Whose asking? Listen pencil-neck something happened to my men. What's going on here? Classified government research. What kind of research? Germ warfare. Okay? Something to complex for you to understand. Christ. Okay people... . Let's- let's listen to the uh... ...Officer here explain our evacuation procedure. I know you're all worried about contamination, but they assure me there is nothing to worry about. So let's just do as they say, okay? I know we haven't had to do anything like this since- Hey Mr. Mayor! Hey Sam. Why they wearing gas masks? Yeah! Tell then to take them off! [crowd screaming all at once] Who am I speaking with? Hello? What is your position now? Who are you? Stay where you are. -What do you mean? - I repeat, Stay where you are, we will come for you. Alright men, I have to ask you to stop right here. Take they're automatic weapons now. Sergeant. Yes sir. Right away. Yes sir. Very good. Captain Conn? Yes sir. Your orders are to stand down. Stand down? You and your men will be taken to your building. Our building? Sir I would like to request that we be extracted from here. Your orders are to stand down. Sir. Yes sir. Let's go, move it out. Let's go. Get in there. Phase two. I can feel my reasoning powers begging to deteriorate. [laughing] [♪] Bravo Patrol, turn down main street. Roger that. The rational thought process is so remote now. We have on occupant, we're bringing her in now. Over. Stay low, move out man. Okay. Let's just do as they say, okay? Everything is going to be fine. For real. [mumbling] Alright I did as you said. Good boy. Wh- What? Just keep moving. Good man. What are you doing? Shoot, I think we got another escape. Get your man down there. Get them down there. Sergeant, get your men down there, we've got to check this train out. Moving in. Get your men on it, I want a detail of all the tracks here. We've spotted some movement, get over here. Move to the front of the tracks. Check around the corners. I think we might have something over here. Nah doesn't check out, I don't have anything over here. Okay lieutenant I'm going to leave you with detail to search the tracks here. I've got to get this train moved out now. [♪] [vomiting] [pills rattling] What the hell are we doing here? We're waiting for them to get us out of here. Hey we don't wait around in motels for anybody! My orders to wait for further instructions. That's what we're doing Elliot, alright? Hey Pete, you okay? [vomiting continues] [toilet flush] I'm getting out of here. Hey there's another patrol moving in. See they're coming to get us. [♪] Something don't look right. They're taking assault positions. Oh that's great. I think we've been fucked. Why they make us turn automatic weapons in? What do you know about this? What was in that research center? [laughs] You're all dead already. Fuck this. Come on guys, let's get out of here. [gunfire] [elevator bell] Phase three. The chemical virus has become highly contagious. [screaming] I remember our laboratory experiments, with our animals becoming cannibalistic. The exposed population will show signs of extreme psychosis, suicidal... tendencies. Sir the video drone has picked up a life form reading. Looks like one of the scientist. He doesn't look to good. Sir it looks like we've got another live one in there. One of the research subjects. One of the hostages. A little odd. [groaning] [helicopter propeller] [♪] Sir the operation is proceeding according to plan. According to census and Intel estimates, we've accounted for ninety-five percent of the population. That isn't good enough. Our medical people tell me that this thing is mutating into a higher level of contagion. People we're holding are to be taken to be neutralized. The agency will handle that. Sir what are you talking about? For Christ sake. These are the big leagues here. We're talking about germ warfare. There are no winner. [radio & gunfire] [♪] We've got to more spotted, sir. Target them. I want to outline high priority targets for our response team. We have to find our delta unit, and their prisoner. If they get wind of our operation, I doubt they'll come quietly. Sir they've been striped of their weapons. I mean, we're talking about five men. Five men? Five special men. These guys are used to surviving tough odds. They don't give a shit. If they make up into the hills. It could take weeks to flush them out. [panting] Well looks like someone was living in here. Get in the corner and stay put. I'm putting you under- Chill out, I'm not going run off. I'm going to need you as much as you're going need me. Shut up. Wow. Wo-hoo. Look at this hat, let's be cowboys. Shut it Elliot the enemy is out there. Hey you shut up, I'm not taking anymore orders from you. What the hell is going on out there. Why are all the men shooting at us? Tell me about the lab! Maybe your one of them. Just get your shit together Elliot. You don't even know if it's loaded. That's not very funny man. Why can't we play cow boy, Bone Conn? I ought to blow your fucking head away. Nice job Angel. [helicopter propeller] [radio] Yeah you know it, get her in there. [♪] [gunfire] Hey Stumper did you see that guys face... ...when you started cutting him up? You fucked it up, you should have cut it to smaller pieces. I know but he was so pretty that guy. Whose this, Mr. Potato head? Where did you get him? I found him wondering around. I say we use him for target practice. No, let's have a show down. Yeah. You know what a show down is? Yeah. It's show time. [laughter] One. Two. Three. [empty gun click] Hey this guy is okay. Want to be a cowboy? They've got the virus. They're starting to loose it. Yeah. We've got to get out of here. I'd love to get out of this, look at this hell. I don't think we'll be able to man. We can reason with them. Well maybe you can. Shit. [♪] [horse neigh] [gunfire] [scream] Mother fuckers! Fuck yeah! [screaming continues] We still haven't accounted for everybody. Sir there appears to be organized resistance out there. They've armed themselves. Our teams have been in several firefights. Guerrilla warfare. Where are the reminisce of the Dealt Forces? Sir we believe that Captain Conn and lieutenant Elliot... ...hightailed it to the high country. Rough terrain and freak snow storms have hampered our search. Look at this. [laughter] Mother-fucking death shoot. Freeze nobody move. Hey Fellah. Take it easy. Did you do all this? Hands up guys. Well you've got yourself a scalp too. Nice job. What are you an Indian? I am an Indian. And Indians and cowboys don't get along. Sure they do. They get along great. Hey uh- want to join up with us? Waste a few more of these suckers? Come on guys, Indian Joe. You want to join up with us. It's going to be a good time. Knock a few of these guys off. Come on. Come on it's a team. Let's go guys. Brothers. Alright! On the war path. [all cheer] [insane laughter] You're just going to kill me Elliot? After all we've been through, you're just going to kill me in cold blood. No. No, we're give you a chance. We're going to play a little game of hide and go seek. I hope you play good. [gunfire] Not good. [cheering] That's it now. [screaming] Angel come on lose them. Step on it. [♪] [grunts] Okay this is where he was last sighted. Okay, move. Uh Sir, I guess that's a negative. We didn't see anything out here. Roger that, proceed to sector four. Roger I'm out. Agent Cross we haven't found anything out here, but we're freezing our bones off. Roger that. Yeah I don't think anything can survive out here. Yeah we roger that. Proceed to next sector. Call up the hunter killer unit from Fort Brag. They can track with their night vision and thermal gear. That should even the odds some. Dammit. We've keep a lid on the press. Could've nuke this sight and called it an accident. Believe me the president would have taken less heat. [♪] Contact unit four, we've got a student down here. Call the kill unit. Roger that, I'm going to disperse all my hard kill units. Patch me through to the hard kill units. Sir we are about to dispatch the video drone. You know what... ...you're getting a reading, what is it? Yeah sir it seems to be life forms. Reading is getting stronger. Follow through on it. I'm watching you on a screen. Come on, just follow though. Yeah we've got two of them. Hello man. We're going to give up man. Yeah we've got tow of them. Okay. [gunfire] He gone, you've got him. I'm getting a reading of another life form. Okay, I'm tracking it. Alright I got us another one. My thermal gear is giving me a reading here. Life form detected somewhere in this house. [♪] Yeah one more down. I think it was that reporter. There's going to be nothing left to report. [♪] Yeah, our unit is live or die here. We hear that. We have to pretty well mop up. That what's stopping us from returning to head quarters. Pick something up? Yeah, I got movement down there. Something at my ten O'clock. He's going into a sewer pipe. I got him. I got him. [gunfire] Come on, easy take down. Jesus. Move. Move. Here you better eat something. [♪] This is killer unit four. Sir one of our video drones has picked up two targets. One of them appears to be Captain Conn. The other one appears to be one of the scientist. I have them in sight. I'm arming the drone. We gonna do them. [gunfire] What are you doing here? Ah looks like they had a little fun with you. They sure tried to do so with me. Surprised to see you alive. What do you mean? Don't you have any symptoms? Any head aches? Throwing up? I feel fine. You look like shit though. Do you wear dog tags? Sure. What the hell are you doing? Like I thought. AB negative. It's a very rare type. So what? AB negative blood is a resistant to the virus. Why do you think I was sent in here? Your scientist... ...were working on the ultimate bio-chemical weapon. And that's why my government had to find the secret. They sent me because they knew that I wouldn't be affected by it. And your government duped you too. Well we've both been fucked. We better get out of here. Jesus Christ, you're the only guy I can trust. [♪] Damn. They've covered the whole perimeter. Look at the size of this installation. Surprise them. There's a marching yard full of motor tolls. We'll hit them here. Yeah we're going to hit them alright. We're going to need a lot more fire power. What are you talking about? We got to get those crazy friends of yours. I think your right. We'll hit them right here. Hard and fast. [♪] You've got a lot of balls coming in here. Elliot king of the shit-heads. Ruling your own private hell. Boss... ...go for it. I came to talk Elliot. It's to late to talk. It's to late for a lot of things. I've got nothing to say to you. You're gonad want to hear this. Bone, you may be good. But do you think you can take all of us. Got him. [♪] Stop! Don't try it. How can you reason with them? Look at them? They're way out there. They've paid the price of your country's illegal experiments and germ warfare. Shut up fuck head! You're lucky to be alive. Look whose here. Our little comi mascot. Shut up. Our red tape. Come on let's get out of here. Shut up, all of you. No matter what happens here, we're dead men anyway. Don't worry about us, we're on the move. No one is going to get us. You're running out of places to hide Elliot. I've got a feeling our friends out there have got our number right now. We got one chance... ...band together, use our skills, try to force a gap in the perimeter. You mean fight it out... ...like old times? Boss? Boss stop it, it's bullshit. He's going to double cross you. He's going to walk you right into a body bag. And I'm not going to stand for that shit. Angel we can use you! Bullshit! Fuck him! Let's move out. Let's move out now. All units move in. All units move in on my signal. Surround the place. [gunfire] [screams] Ah Victor, come in. Come in Victor. Come in Lieutenant. This is Victor here. Yeah anything to report? Ah no Sir, it's all quiet here. Roger that, I'll get back now. You got to cover for me, I'm going to go take a leak. I don't think we can get out of here alive. Yeah? We can take a few of them with us though. Sir check your monitor. It's two of our priority targets. For Christ sake. Those two are operating as a team. Don't worry sir. Our units are tightening the noose, we'll soon mop everybody up. Don't worry? We're talking about a couple of pros here. Both dangerous as hell. I think it's time we talk to our friendly counter parts.... ...about comrade Boris. Get me a line to USSR and their embassy. Do it. General, no I don't see anything. [gunfire] I've got hostiles in the perimeter. Go, go, go, move! He's moving towards the tree line. Come on aim the gun out there. He's in the tree line. Okay target in sight. I read him at fifteen degrees north of here, fire! Fire at will! I want you to fire at these coordinates. Thirty north east, can you see him? Ye-haw! Move it, come on we've got to lend some help. Here. Sir they've taken a mortar. They've move in to our position sir. They've open fire on us. Mother-fuckers! [screaming] Someone is drawing fire away from us. Shit it's Angel. He came back with an ambulance. Shit let's use him. Yeah, good diversion. Fuck you! Sir do you see them? Yeah we've got the target in sight. [screaming] Gun him down. What the fuck. [screaming] Die you ass holes! Fucking... Ye-haw! [♪] I think we're safe now. We've made it across the border. I wouldn't be to sure. Where the hell is the border? Who the hell knows how far this thing has spread. Yeah. Hey we've got to keep on going. I think we've made it. Shh. This is where I say goodbye. You know I can't let you go. What are you going to do? Hand me over to your government? They're going to shoot you on the spot. Just like me, you're going to have to be on the run for the rest of your life. Maybe I'll kill you. Hey. Come on, get me out of the States, and I'll take care of you in Paris. We'll live like kings, come on. Come on. [♪] Sir we have them in sight. Charge them. Roger. Freeze. Drop your weapons. Drop your weapons. Drop them and get on the ground. Alright secure them. Both of them. Alright come on, move them out. East vs West, winner takes nothing. No surprise Conn. You did the impossible, you made it past the perimeter. Alright move it out. Groschew, so you've made a deal with the Americans? I should have known. We should have sent you to Siberian when you were a teenager Boris. I never taught you'd go this far Cunningham. Neither did we. But history is full of such events. With every bold step forward into the future... ...There are always the side story that's not so clean. This is a small price to pay for our country's security. But history is also full of idiot men, and Hitlers... ...and Stalins. You will never be able to contain it. It will get out. [gunshot] This is America, you'll never pull this off. Boris was right. You're not even infected, you're not even a carrier. You know, world war III will be a war of science. And we can't afford to be left behind. Other wise we won't even know what hit us. Job well done Conn. Now for you! You're infected now. Guards! [radio]looks like one of our targets is loose. Go! [radio continues] Come in what's going on down there? I don't know what's going on down there. I can't see a thing down there. [radio continues] [♪] [insane laughing]
