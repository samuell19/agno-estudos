- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes That you Serg? Number 4 here. Been a job done. 27, Williams Street. 27, Williams Street, burglary. I'm afraid that's all we can tell you, gentlemen. - The diamonds were worth... - About ?5,000. Yes. We'll do our best to trace the burglars. Don't you think it would be more interesting to trace the diamonds, Superintendent? What do you mean, Collie? Well, just you might line a bigger game than a jewel thief... ...if you could follow those diamonds tonight. But governor, I've got to split three ways with the boys. There won't be enough left to have a drink on. Can't you make it seven hundred? Then I won't do it. I know a man in the city will pay me more than ?1000. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right. I'll take the cash. - How much did you get? - 500 quid. Five Hundred quid? The dirty swine. - Do we have to deal with him? - Yes, he knows we did the job. If we didn't sell to him, he'd turn us over to the police. Five hundred quid's better than a cell in Pentonville. Hasn't anybody ever tried to follow him? Nobody who's alive to talk about it. How much longer is he going to get away with this? Till he meets a man who knows him. # He's gone # # He was my only one # # He's gone # # He took away the sun # # And left with sympathy # # He's gone # # The Lord alone knows where he's gone # # And what is there to care for # # Since he's gone from me # # I never cared for what he was # # Just him, not what he says or does # # I pray all day for his return # # He's gone # # He never will return # # And I'm left wondering why he's gone # - Good evening, Mr. Graeme. - Good evening, Mary. Won't you sit down? Larry! I'm so happy to see you. - Sit down, darling. - I can't stay, Tammy. Why, Larry... - Not even for a little supper? - Not even to be with you. Can't you stay just a little while? Is it... business? Big business. Big enough to end all our worries. If it works. Tomorrow night? Supper. - Good luck, darling. - I'll need it. What's the matter, Mr. Field? I thought you liked that story. That's exactly the trouble, its a great story. But every other paper in town's had it on the street for two hours. Tear it off. Where have you been all night? I've tried every pub in London for you. I even tried your home. - Was I not there? - Ah! Oh, here, have you seen this grand story... ...about a jewel robbery they've got in the Dispatch? I'm glad you liked it, Mr. Collie. But you're paid to cover crime stories, not to read about them! But I've been working all night, Mr. Field. - Shut up! - On a real story. And about a certain man who buys stolen jewels... ...and sometimes squeaks on the robber to the police. We've been chasing the Squeaker for months, Collie. But I can't print guesses. Right now I've got two million readers to please. And they'd like to know who stole the Van Rissik pearls. Aye, so would Scotland Yard. What you brought me in for, governor? Why, I done no jewel robbery. No, you've just done a five-year stretch for one. Officer, I can't wait, I've got an appointment. If you're not careful, Charlie, you're going to keep it. - What do you know about the Van Rissik job? - Just a moment. I'd like to talk to this man myself. Sergeant, take him along to my office. Come on. I'm glad you recognized me, Superintendent. I'm surprised I ever did. You, Barabal. One of the best men I ever had. Picked up with a suspect in a jewel robbery. What have you been doing with yourself? It's a long story. Tell me. Well, my last assignment was India, you know all about that. I started drinking and let you down. After that I went home to Canada. Now, well... here I am. Are you still drinking? At the moment, only by invitation. Why don't you give it up? I tried that once for six months. Took me two years to get over it. - How are things going with you, sir? - Not very good. - I'm worried. - Worried? Yes. This plant isn't doing as well as it should. Why don't you put it in the sunshine? Give it a chance. Uh, yes... What are you doing now, Barabal? Looking for a job. Tried the detective agencies? Oh, I won't chase any loose husbands. Not after ten years in the Yard. You were a good detective, I've missed you... badly. As a matter of fact I could give you a job right now. But there's no room here for a man who only wants to play. Oh, I've taken a long time to learn that, sir. Barabal, do you think you could cut out drinking... ...if I were to give you another chance? I'd cut out breathing for that. All right. There's a man in this town who's been running us around in circles for months. - You mean the Squeaker? - Yes. He's the cleverest criminal in London. He runs the underworld and he's getting more dangerous every day. - Now, if you were to get him. - Then I'd get my job back? You would have the whole Yard. Only remember, there must be no more drinking. Hm. Could I have a glass of water? Are you looking for a valuable silk scarf? Right. The Van Rissik pearls. They're worth ?50,000. But you can have them for 30,000 for a quick sale. Ten thousand, do you think I'm crazy? Why, you can sell them anywhere for twice what I'm asking. Listen, I've got the stuff right here, but I'm not giving it away. You can have it but not at that price. I know who you are. Why, you're... - Hello, Larry. - Who are you? Is that a nice way to talk to an old friend? Barabal! You've changed a bit. - What do you want here? - A little information. Oh, so you're back with the Yard, eh? No, but I ought to be. Thought you might give me a helping hand. Why should I want to help a copper? Because you'd be helping yourself. - May I have a little drink? - Sure, go ahead. Thanks. Larry, I want to get back into the Yard. But I can't do it unless I get one man. - The Squeaker. - And what's that got to do with me? I know the game you're in. And I know how you get rid of the stuff. Sooner or later you've got to sell to the Squeaker. And every person who's ever dealt with him is would up behind the bars. Or worse. I'd like to make a deal with you. You're talking to the wrong man, Barabal. I don't know the Squeaker and if I did, I wouldn't talk. I'm in love with... Anyway, I'm not running any risks that I don't have to. Then you'd better keep away from the Squeaker. Good luck, Larry. - Good luck to you. - Thanks. And give my thanks to Superintendent Marshall. What's the matter? It's good scotch. What a pity. Beer. Hello, Collie. Never mind the beard, I'm Barabal. Oh... Barabal! I'm glad to see you here. - What are you doing here? - Looking for work. - Oh, what's wrong with Scotland Yard? - Nothing wrong with the Yard. That's why I'm here. - Can you help me? - I'll try to. Good. Have a drink. Thanks. I understand there's a man around here... ...who goes out of his way to help people who are down and out. Doesn't object to beards, clothes, past reputation. As a matter of fact they tell me he's particularly kind... ...to men with criminal records. Oh? Strange. Very strange. Who is he? Mr. Frank Sutton, a very respectable business man. Hm. Where is he? At A.G. Stedman and Co. He's their general manager. - Could you give me a note to him? - I'd be glad to. But you've got no criminal record, Barabal. I might have... by tonight. Stedman and Co. No, Mr. Sutton's not in. I don't know when he'll be back. No, don't come here, you won't be able to see him all day. Well, I can't do anything about that. Mr. Sutton hasn't got any jobs. Well, that's your worry! Goodbye! Well, that wasn't very kind of you, Millie. - But they're always pestering me. - Well, you've got a job and they haven't. You ought to listen to what they've got to say. But you should see some of the men who come in here. You can't judge people by their clothes, Millie. You've got to talk to them to find out what they're really like. Well, what would you like me to do, Miss Stedman? Well, next time somebody asks for Mr. Sutton, see how nice you can be. Yes, Miss Stedman. - Is Mr. Sutton in? - No, not at the moment. - I'll be back later then. - Oh, no, please don't go. - Hm? - I'm quite sure he will be in very shortly. - Would you care to wait? - Thank you. - Shall I wait outside? - Oh, please! Go right in Mr. Sutton's office. - I told her to. - Hm? Won't you sit down? Mr. Sutton won't be long. - Are you his secretary? - No, um... a friend. Oh, then maybe you can tell me what I want to know. I'm, um... Captain John Leslie. - Has Mr. Sutton any jobs open? - No, I don't think... Well, what sort of job do you want? Oh, I've done practically everything. - What exactly? - Well, um... Shall we pull up a chair? Yes. - Where is Mr. Sutton, Millie? - I suppose he's still at lunch, miss. - Have you any idea when he'll be back? - Well, his habits aren't regular. For example, Tuesday. Well, that wouldn't be quite the same thing as Wednesday, I mean to say. - Suppose it were Thursday. - Is today Thursday? No, Friday. Oh, but that's different. Everybody's always late Friday. The end of the week, you know. But I'm surprised that Mr. Sutton keeps... Hello, Carol. How long have you been waiting? - So far back I can't remember. - Sorry, I was down at the docks. What can I do for you? Well, first of all, your first deed for the day, buy a rose. That's easy. Anything else? Yes, I want you to answer a question. Well, fire away. Than you. Frank, suppose you'd been out of a job for months, absolutely broke. Your clothes were shabby and you couldn't even afford a shave. You'd still be the same Frank Sutton, wouldn't you? Why, yes, of course, dear, what are you getting at? Frank, this is Captain Leslie. - How do you do? - How do you do? Will you tell Mr. Sutton everything you told me? Of course, gladly. Thank you, Frank. I must get back to my rose selling. Just a minute. Would you mind waiting in my office? Not at all. What's this all about? Oh, you'll know when you've heard his story. He's managed shipping offices all over the world. - He looks like a tramp. - But he doesn't talk like one. And you said yourself only a minute ago... ...that a man's bad luck shouldn't be held against him. Oh, you will try and give him a chance, won't you, Frank? - I'll try. - You're a darling. Now, Capt. Leslie, tell me all about yourself. Well, I've had about eight years' experience at shipping. Everything from checking cargos to running an entire office. These, um... These references will probably tell you all you want to know about my ability, character and honesty. Daddy, Daddy! There's an awful-looking man at the door with a funny beard on his face. On his face? Now isn't that a peculiar place for a man to have a beard? Well, well, well, I didn't expect to see you so soon. - Did you get a job? - I did. - That's why a dropped in, to thank you. - Ah, it was nothing. I thought Sutton would be the man for you. Oh, Mr. Sutton was very nice, but I'd be standing outside yet if it weren't for you. - I'm very grateful to you, believe me. - Ah, come on in and sit down. Thank you. Hello? Mr. Field down at the newspaper. As soon as he stops talking tell him I'll be down right away. Your friend seems a bit excited, doesn't he? Oh, it's only the boss. You see, I promised him a story... on the Squeaker. A thousand words and I can't even think of one. You wouldn't know anything about the Squeaker, would you? Hm? Well, only the talk down at the docks. You know, you can't roll around in mud for six months... ...without getting some dirt in your ears. You're a lucky fellow, Collie. A lovely home and a fine family. They'd miss you a lot if anything went wrong, wouldn't they? What do you mean by that? Don't let your job drag you into something you can't get out of. The Squeaker moves in a different world than this. And a much more dangerous one. Good night. You sent for me, Inspector? My name's Sutton. - How do you do, Mr. Sutton? - How do you do? - We'd like you to help us. - Gladly. Do you know a man called Frank Weston? No... - No, I'm afraid I don't. - Are you sure? Quite. I'm just going to check over his fingerprints. Thought you' like to come along, Mr. Sutton, you might find it interesting. - I'd like to very much. - Good! Thank you. - Ever been in the Yard before? - No, but I've always wanted to. All the male fingerprints are filed here. Women in the next room. - About six million of them. - I see. Nothing very romantic but still, we get results. - Rogers. - Yes, sir? - Check that print, will you? - Very good, sir. You see, a lot of our work lies in our preventing crime. Shutting the door before the horse is stolen. I'll be glad to cooperate with you in any way I can, Inspector. - Thank you. - Here you are, sir. Now we have Mr. Weston's other names. George Fenton, Sir Charles Minter, Harry Stormer, Captain John Leslie... - Why, yes! That's the name of the man I engaged today. Oh, and he probably told you he was an ex-Canadian Army officer... a bit down on his luck, of course, and he had a batch of very impressive references. How on earth did you know? Here you are, look at that. Two years in Montreal, Canada, for forgery? Eighteen months at Pentonville for embezzlement. Three years at Parkhurst for receiving stolen property. Dangerous. But Leslie was sent to me by Joshua Collie. You know, the Post courier man. That's most peculiar. Collie's a very peculiar man. He has contacts... ...that even the police know nothing about. What would you like me to do? We can't advise you, Mr. Sutton, we can only tell you the facts. Weston, or Leslie, or whatever he calls himself, hasn't been through our hands for four years because he may be going straight. On the other hand, he has had three convictions. And I should advise you to keep a careful eye on him. Thank you, Inspector. And if that Collie ever comes in again, tell him he's through. Fifteen minutes to press time. And I'm nothing but mad at him. Have you got a match, Mr. Field? No, but I've got your walking papers. You miserable, worthless, incompetent. You're sacked! Well now, that's too bad, Mr. Field. Such a nice, sweet story too, and nobody else knows about it. Here, wait a minute! Have you got a line on the Squeaker? - Have you got a match? - Yes. What do you know? Well, I don't know that I ought to tell you about it now. Have a drink, Collie. Say when. I don't know the word. Come in. Alfie here, miss. Alfie, would you get me some Chinese food as soon as you can, please? Do you understand? Oh, yes, miss. What was it you wanted, miss? Some Chinese food. Chinese. Chinese. Chinese. This is a lovely place, Frank. - Yes, it is a good spot, isn't it? - I've had a grand day today. - How so? - Well, I've sold millions of roses... ...and I got Capt. Leslie a job. It was awfully nice of you, darling. - I feel like celebrating. - Good, what would you like? You do think he'll be a success, don't you? I don't know. I wasn't going to tell you this, Carol. Tell me what? Well, your Capt. Leslie has a very bad criminal record. - He's a criminal? - Yes. How do you know? Scotland Yard sent for me this evening and told me all about him. Aliases, jail sentences. I was never so surprised in my life. But... are you sure it's the same Captain Leslie? My dear, I saw his photograph. Shall we drink some champagne? # I hear applause goes with romance # # I've given love every possible chance # # What can I do when I'm lonely and blue # # I can't get along without you # # I may be wrong but I feel in my bones # # People with glass hearts # # Shouldn't throw stones # # Speaking of hearts # # Though I've broken a few # # I can't get along without you # # Maybe it's a foolish notion # # But when I feel you near # # Life has brought a new emotion # # It's love at last, my dear # # Tell me it's true, give me a sign # # A kiss in the dark # # Just to prove that you're mine # # Don't let me go # # For whatever I do # # I can't get along without you # - Good evening, Mr. Graeme. - Good evening to you. We have a nice crowd tonight, sir. Fine. - Who's he, Dad? - Who asked you to ask questions? Well, if I don't, how am I going to learn anything? You got a pair of ears, ain't you? Yes. I don't know how you can be my son and still be such a fool. Well I am. Ain't I, Dad? This is awfully good, Tammy. - You could have had it last night. - Why didn't you come? - I was busy. That, um... that deal I told you about. - How did the show go tonight? - Oh, they seemed to like it. - Good crowd? - Yes, fine. - Who was out there? - I don't know, Larry. I didn't see anybody but you. Me? You were the only one there. Tammy, if I decided to leave town very soon, would you come with me? Yes, of course, dear. Is anything the matter? Has something gone wrong? No... no, not a thing. But you never can tell. - Good evening, Martin. - Good evening, sir. - Any packages for me? - I put them on your desk, sir. Thanks. Oh, Martin. Yes, sir? - Put this record on. - Yes, sir. That'll be all. Very good, sir. "This is the man who tried to sell you the Van Rissik pearls on the embankment. I hope you remember me as well as I remember you. In case you were thinking of mentioning our meeting, I don't think that would be a good idea... ...for either of us. It would upset me very much. And it would probably upset you." This is the fifteenth squeak note we've had, Alfred. And in every case we've made an arrest. Yes, but the Squeaker isn't helping the Yard, he's giving us orders. He makes us arrest every crook who refuses to sell to him. And not one of them knows the Squeaker. Do you think Barabal will have any luck, sir? I hope so. I want you to go ahead on your own lines but give him all the help you can. Anything he wants. He's following a little tip I gave him. Who do you wish to see, sir? - Why, er, Mr. Sutton. Mr. Sutton's not in yet. - You'll have to wait. - Would you mind if I waited in that office? I should think I would mind. That's Capt. Leslie's office. Our new traffic manager. Thank you. Will you let me know when he comes in? - Good morning, Miss Stedman. - Good morning. Well, well, it's nice seeing you here this morning. You know, yesterday I didn't have a chance to thank you for everything you did for me. For me? Yes, Capt. Leslie, by way of... congratulation. Funny how things can change overnight. Only yesterday I was... well... You remember how I looked. And I remember what you said. Are these flowers your idea really? They were for Mr. Sutton, actually. But I thought they'd be a pleasant change for you. So different from the things you've been accustomed to. Oh, you mean the waterfront? I've forgotten all about that. I'm so happy to be back at work again. And when the day's work is over, that's that, isn't it? What do you mean? I mean you'll not return into a dreary cell at night, no locks, no guards, no lights out. What are you talking about? You ought to know what I'm talking about, Capt. Leslie. Or is your name Weston, or Harry Stormer, or... - Wait a minute? - Why did you do it? Why did you lie to me? You could have told me the truth, it wouldn't have made any difference. I wanted to help you as I'd have helped anyone who was in trouble. I wanted to be your friend and you... You made a fool of me. Who told you about me? - Frank Sutton. - Who told him? Scotland Yard. The one place you haven't fooled. I see. You've gone to a lot of trouble to tell me this. Why? Well, I suppose you've arranged for my dismissal. I didn't think that would be necessary. Your pass. Three pennies, please. Thank you. This one's on Scotland Yard. Larry Graeme has been arrested for the Van Rissik robbery. But... ...his imprisonment will not end the stolen jewelry racket in London. Only the capture of the Squeaker, who was behind Graeme's arrest, a-double r-r-e-s-t, and is behind organized crime in this city... ...can do that. Full stop. Can Scotland Yard do the trick? Question. - Hello, Frank. - Hello, Carol how did the game go? Oh, not too well. I felt a bit let down. You shouldn't have taken that trip to town this morning. Why did you go? Nothing important. Oh, by the way, I've asked someone down this afternoon, I hope you don't mind. - Who is it? - Captain Leslie. Oh, you haven't! To my house? - Yes. - Oh, Frank, why did you ask him? Well, I've been thinking about Leslie. He may have knocked about a bit, but... Hm, several bits in London and a bit in Montreal for two years. That was some time ago. He knows shipping and I can use him. Well, Scotland Yard thinks you can do without him. Besides, you've got no right to take that risk with my father's business. You mean you want me to let him go? Yes. It was your idea to take him on, you know, and now you're asking me to fire him. You want me to do it? Well, if it's going to be done, don't you think you should? All right, I will. Captain Leslie's here, miss. Oh, thank you. Oh, Annie, have you ever been fired? Oh, Miss Carol! Oh, don't be silly, I'm not giving you the sack. But what do people say when they ask you to go? You mean when they gives you the shove? Well, generally they say they're very sorry... ...but things ain't quite what they expected. The last one said she didn't allow no followers in the kitchen. Anything else? They gives you a weak's wages and makes arrangements about your trunk. Is that all? Well, if you're nasty about it, they sometimes gives you a nice reference. I haven't much faith in references. Good afternoon, Capt. Leslie. - Oh, good afternoon! - I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Oh, that's quite all right, I was just admiring your lovely home. - But I thought Mr. Sutton was going to... - Mr. Sutton told me to talk to you. Carol have you seen my handbag... Oh! - Oh, I beg your pardon. - Mother, this is Capt. Leslie. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Carol's told me so much about you. - Not too much, I trust. I simply told Mother about some of the interesting places you've been to. South America, Egypt, and... - Canada. - Oh, Canada! Fascinating country. - Have you spent much time in Montreal? - Montreal? I spent... Well, let us just say I was, um... I was there for, um... - Two years, wasn't it? - Two years, exactly. I've the greatest affection for Montreal. That's where I met Arthur, my husband, you know. - Really, you don't say. - Lovely city! Did you like it? Well, it was a little lonely at first but, um... I got used to it. You know how it is. No, I don't. - Where did you live in Montreal? - Hm? Oh, um... I had a nice little place, um... ...overlooking the river. Nothing elaborate, but it was very quiet. Specially at night. Yes. I always say that it doesn't matter how small a place is so long as it's home. You're quite right, but I never thought of it in that light before. Carol, you must ask Capt. Leslie over to dinner one night soon. I'm sure we have so many mutual friends in Montreal to talk about. - Well, goodbye, Captain Leslie. - Goodbye. - See you again soon. - Yes, indeed, thank you. It'll be a pleasure. It was kind of your mother to ask me to dinner. You're very good at making good first impressions, aren't you, Capt. Leslie? Yes, and... sometimes they last. Well, goodbye. Please tell Mr. Sutton I called and... ...that I will send the money for these clothes as soon as I get another job. And will you please accept my thanks? - Thanks for what? - For yesterday. And today. What are you going to do? Well, for one thing, I'm going to stop telling lies... ...to lovely ladies. - That's not what I meant. - What did you mean? I don't know why I went to the office this morning. I don't know why I'm talking to you now? You're talking to me because Mr. Sutton wants to keep me on. Isn't that right? - Yes. - And you don't. It's got nothing to do with me. This is my father's business, he's built it up for years. It wouldn't be fair to him. - Good afternoon, Capt. Leslie. - Good afternoon, Mr. Sutton. - Has Miss Stedman talked to you? - Yes, she has. - I'm very sorry... - Frank! What night next week is our party? Wednesday. You'll be able to come, won't you? I'll be delighted. Then you've come around to my way of thinking, Carol. No, I thought it all out for myself. Good. I'm very glad, Leslie. I don't care what you've been as long as you can produce... ...results for me, that's the point. - That's very generous. - I'm giving you a great opportunity. Indeed you are, Mr. Sutton, and believe me, I'll make the most of it. Goodbye, Capt. Leslie, it's been lovely having you here. I never spent a more pleasant afternoon. Thank you. By the way... When Mr. Sutton told you he was going to give you a great opportunity, what did you mean by saying you'd make the most of it? What did you mean when you changed your mind about me? Well, I meant... Well, I felt... Well, you understand, I... That's just what I meant. What time is it? May I have a glass of water? Listen, we've been here half the night, how long is this going on? Until you tell us who the Squeaker is. Cigarette? You're facing a fifteen-year sentence, you know? And because the Squeaker put you here. You tell us who he is and we'll get him. No, thanks, I'll settle that account myself. Not for fifteen years you won't. You talk sense and we may be able to help you. All right, I'll talk. Have a cigarette. Can I have that glass of water? A glass of water for Mr. Graeme. Thanks. Man escaped! Guard all gates! All police out in Cannon Road! The police are expecting a break... Collie, we've only got ten minutes to catch the City edition. - So be on with it! - Aye, aye, aye. ...are expecting a break in the Squeaker case any moment. Following the phenomenal escape, phenomenal, f-e-n-o... You can spell that one yourself. Following the phenomenal escape of Larry Graeme... ...from Scotland Yard early this morning. As sources close to headquarters told this reporter today... that Graeme was believed to have information... ...concerning the notorious fence and police informant. Larry! Tammy, I've come to say goodbye. You've seen the papers. I should have told you about that before but I was afraid to lose you. You can never lose me, Larry. No, Tammy, I should never have started this. I thought I could beat the game by pulling off one last job and getting away. I thought I could make a new start, marry you, live like a human being. - But you can, you can. - I'm a fugitive from justice, Tammy. - Do you know what that means? - You can hide here till I'm finished. I might be able to help you. I'm afraid not, Tammy, the police are after me. - Yes? - You're on soon, Miss Tamara. Can I help you? - No, thank you. I'll let you know. - Thank you. I asked a friend of mine to send a parcel here. - Did it come? - A parcel? Oh, yes. What's in there, darling? It's just a hat and coat. One minute, Miss Tamara. Are you ready? Yes, I'm ready. - Take me with you, Larry. - No, Tammy, it's too dangerous. - Must you go? - Yes. It's an appointment I've got to keep. - With a man named Sutton. - Sutton. If anybody asks for me, you don't know where I am, you don't know anything about me. - Will I ever see you... - I don't know. - ...again? - I hope so, Tammy. Whatever happens... I love you. Take care of yourself, darling. Bless you. # He's gone # # He was my only one # # He's gone # # He took away the sun # # And left me sympathy # # He's gone # # The Lord alone knows where he's gone # # And what is there to care for # # Since he's gone from me # Quite sure Sutton will be at the party tonight? Well, it's part of his game, sir. And Graeme is desperate enough to follow him there. That means trouble for them but a great chance for you, Barabal. - Sure you don't need any help? - No, sir. Good. Well, keep your eyes and ears open and be prepared for anything. Right, sir. I don't think I quite approve your collar. Sorry. You didn't seem to mind my clothes the first time we met. Why did you arrive late for my party? Why, I had to... And who are those distinguished-looking gentlemen? Shh! Friends of the family. - Your daddy's? - No, Mummy's. Mummies? Mummy's. Oh, Capt. Leslie. - How do you do? - I've got some friends from Montreal. I told them you were coming and they've so much they want to ask you. Yes, I daresay. Oh, Mother, Mrs. Drickerman-Thurbury has been looking for you everywhere. Mrs. Drickerman-Thurbury? But she fell off her horse this afternoon. Too bad, How is the horse... I mean, how is Mrs. Thuringham-Drickbury? Mother, she's looking for you. - Don't you like dancing? - Very much. But, um... not at the moment. Are you worried about anything? Yes. Yes, I'm afraid I am. Something I've done? No. No, I'm terribly happy about you. - As a matter of fact I... - I'm so glad. - Thank you, Carol. - Darling. Oh, we should go inside. There are hundreds of people, guests and newspapermen... Suppose you do that, and I'll join you later. All right. Not too much later. Good evening, Mr. Sutton. - Hello, Graeme. - We're going to take a little walk. - Where? - To a police station. I came here tonight to kill you but I've changed my mind. - If you turn me in they've got you too. - They've got me. I'll do fifteen years but you'll do life. Don't be a fool Graeme. I can get you out of the country tonight. Life in a prison, full of men who know you and hate you. How will you like that, Sutton? Listen, I'll give you all the money you want. Anything, You'll get everything that's coming to you. I'll give it to you right now. Graeme had been linked to the Squeaker case... ...before his escape from Scotland Yard early today. Inspector Elford and several policemen... began questioning the guests and servants... ...at the Stedman home shortly after 10 o'clock. Late this evening... ...the police appear to have narrowed their case down to a single suspect. Lieutenant Leslie, you're under arrest. - For what? - Murder. Why? Because I'm afraid there's nothing else the police can do in the circumstances. But you've got no proof against him, nobody saw him do anything. You're only making things difficult to the inspector, Carol. I'd like to help Leslie too, but... after all, Scotland Yard have a job to do and... Have they got to do it whether they're right or wrong, whether a man is innocent or guilty? Are they interested in justice or merely making an arrest? Must you put someone behind the bars no matter who it is? Now, wait a minute, Carol, let's be fair to the police. Leslie unfortunately has a bad record. He admits knowing Larry Graeme... ...and papers were found on him that could have been taken only from the body. You said yourself that he disappeared shortly before the killing. That doesn't prove anything. The proof, I'm sorry to say, had to come from me. The body was not lying there a few minutes before he reported the murder. The murderer must have come from the house, otherwise you would have seen him... ...since you came down the drive. Isn't that so, Mr. Sutton? Yes. - Can we get along now, Inspector? - We can. Haven't you anything to say? No explanation, nothing? There's nothing I can say. Then you did? You brought this on yourself, Mr. Sutton. I warned you about Leslie. Well, it worked so far. That fake arrest certainly made Sutton talk. He did admit being in the garden just before the murder. - Who have you got watching the house? - Collins and Berenson. - Good men? - Very good. Fine. You know, Sutton was so anxious to squeak on me... ...he did a little squeaking on himself. Oh, let me have another look at those papers I took from the body. What we need is a definite link between Sutton and Graeme. You're right. And I think I've got it. Good evening, sir. Barabal, I want to talk to you. Do you mind, Inspector? You've let me down for the last time. A man was killed tonight right under your nose... ...because you were off dancing with a girl. You've let someone get away with a cold-blooded murder. Sutton is the murderer and he isn't getting away with it. Then why didn't you bring him in? Because we couldn't have held him for one minute on the evidence we had. Sutton's known as a respectable businessman. And he's engaged to a very fine girl. Unless we had a perfect case he could get a well-known solicitor... ...and make Scotland Yard look ridiculous. Sutton's no ordinary crook. So I couldn't use ordinary methods. No... No, that's not good enough. I'm afraid you're through. You liked your fun more than your job four years ago, you do still. - Good night. - Wait a minute, sir. Suppose I could break this case for you tonight. - How do you expext to... - Let me have Elford for two hours... - ...and I'll show you. - What are you going to do? First I'm going to talk to Larry Graeme's girl. I think she knows something. And if she doesn't, I have another plan to make Sutton talk. All right, but you've got to do it tonight. I will, or my name isn't Inspector Barabal. - Inspector Barabal? - Yes, sir. Inspector Barabal. Well, I'm all ready to go. Packed, reservations, everything. But I'm not leaving without you. I'm not running away, Frank, I told you that before. It's not running away, it's the only sensible thing to do. By tomorrow, this place will be overrun with newspapermen, policemen, you won't have a moment's peace. But that doesn't worry me, Frank. They'll drag you into court, get you up in front of a lot of people, ask you all sorts of questions. What possible good can you do by staying? I may be able to help Capt. Leslie. He's not worth helping, Carol, he's just killed a man, the police proved it. - With your assistance! - I was only doing my duty as a citizen. You don't think he's innocent, do you? I don't believe he could harm anyone. Are you in love with him? I am. Why, you can't be! Hello? Yes. Yes, he's here. Wait a minute. It's Scotland Yard for you. Scotland Yard? Hello? Yes, it's Frank Sutton speaking. Come down tonight? I'm very sorry, Inspector Elford, I'm afraid I... Well, you see, I'm terribly tired, I've had a long day. Will tomorrow do? You can't do that, Frank, you'll be out of the country by tomorrow. I've had enough excitement for tonight and quite enough of policemen. You must go. You've just been talking about your duties as a citizen. All right. Hello? Yes, Inspector, I'll be down in about an hour. And I'm going with you. Has Miss Tamara been on yet? The second door on the... left, sir. Excuse me, sir, Miss Tamara's in her dressing room. - Who shall I say? - Thank you... Sergeant Hawkins. Blind our eyes, it's Captain Jack! Oh, a sailor, eh? No, he was a captain in the Canadian Army, him and me was in the war together. What war, Dad? The Crusades. Oh. - Miss Tamara? - Yes. My name is Barabal. I'm from Scotland Yard. I understand that you're quite a good friend of Larry Graeme. I know him, slightly. - Oh, I thought that you and he were... - No, no, just a friend. Well... I'm afraid you've lost that friend. Lost him? No... it isn't true. It can't be. It's just a trick... ...to make me talk. I only wish it were. But that's impossible. I talked to him... right here... ...just a few hours ago. Oh, then you saw him here tonight. Did he say where he was going? Now, now, I'm not trying to hurt you, my dear. But I want to get the man who killed Larry, so I've got to tell me where he went. Won't you please believe me? No! Well, we've got to know sooner or later. So, you may as well come with me. Please. Get a glass of water. I'm terribly sorry. - You'll, er, take care of that now? - Yes, sir. Scotland Yard in half an hour. Thank you. Is there anything you'd like to tell me? Now. Yes. I'll try. - Won't you sit down, Frank? - No, thanks. How long is this... Inspector Barabal going to be? I don't know, sir. - Who is he, anyway? - Criminal investigation, sir. - Is Inspector Elford here? - Yes, sir. - I'd like to see him. - Very good, sir. - Will you wait here, Carol? - Yes, Frank. This way, sir. Can't you remember the name of the man Larry Graeme mentioned? If you could, it would save us a lot of trouble. - Wasn't it Sutton? - I don't know. I'm not sure. I'm not sure of anything. Then you couldn't swear to it. Suppose I left you alone for a while. Do you think it might come back to you? It might. - I'll try. - All right, let's do that. - Constable. - Yes, sir. - Please take this lady to the waiting room. - Very good, sir. - Dale. - Yes, sir? - Elford got all those men down there? - They're in the office, sir. Is everything ready in the investigation room? Yes, sir, just as you ordered them. - Has Mr. Sutton come yet? - Yes, sir, with Miss Stedman. Miss Stedman? All right, thank you. You know I want to help the police, Inspector, but I'm a busy man. I've told you everything I know. Why wait for Barabal? He's in charge of the case, Mr. Sutton. - He knows all about Leslie, doesn't he? - All about him. Then what can he possibly want from me? Why not ask him yourself? Good evening, Mr. Sutton. Mr. Sutton, Inspector Barabal. Oh, I'm sorry to have kept you waiting. I hope you'll forgive my little deception, but, um... Well, you see, it's all in a day's work. That's quite all right, Inspector. I was on a case down at the docks looking for a man they call the Squeaker and... Oh, yes, I've heard of him. He's... What is it you call a man who buys stolen property? A fence, Mr. Sutton. Yes. Well, what's that got to do with this murder case? Nothing, except that the Squeaker killed Larry Graeme. Really? How do you know? Because Graeme told his girl he was out to get him. Did he say who the Squeaker was? - Why, um... - Forgive me. my natural curiosity got the better of me. - Yes. - It's a pity that, er... that no one witnessed the shooting... ...because now you can't arrest anybody, can you? Well, I don't suppose I'll be seeing you at the office tomorrow. No, I don't think you will. I'll be back on a job that I know something about. Oh, did Insp. Elford ever show you how we handle our murder investigations? - No. - Why don't you go along for a minute? Yes, it might be a new experience for you. No, thank you, Inspector, I've had rather a strenuous night. Just to show there's no hard feeling? Very well. A great many things have happened in this room, Mr. Sutton. - What the... - Did you say anything, Mr. Sutton? No... I'm just surprised. That's Lou Perrigan. He's doing three years in Pentonville. The Squeaker put him there. Jack Maine, he'll be out next month. He'd shoot the Squeaker on the site if he knew who he was. Tom Hand, he wouldn't meet the Squeaker's price. We got the usual note. What note is that? Oh, you wouldn't know about that. Harry Blake, his wife committed suicide... ...when the Squeaker double-crossed him. Can we go now, I'm getting rather tired. There's only one more. That man quarrelled with the Squeaker. Look here, I've had just about all I can stand of this. Larry Graeme had more than he could stand. What's that to do with me? You were at the party where the murder occurred. Yes, and so were seventy other people and they were there before I even arrived. Yes, but you said yourself, Mr. Sutton, that Larry Graeme must have been shot after you reached the house. Look here, Leslie, are you trying to pin anything on me? There's nothing I can pin on you. Is there? Then I'll be going. This is the shortest way, Mr. Sutton. Well, what else do you want? I'd like you to make a statement before you leave. I'm not doing anything till I've talked to my solicitor. Why not call him now, there's a telephone in that room. All right, I will! Why don't you turn on some light? Sorry, the lights don't work, but you'll find a telephone on the desk. What are you doing with that door? Just trying the lock. Hello... hello! Operator! I can't get any answer. Doesn't anything work here? I'll get it for you. We're used to doing your work. I've had just about enough of your insults, Leslie. You've no right to hold me here. - What's all this Barabal? - Are you the chief here? I am. I want to make a complaint against this man. He's been trying to intimidate me, to implicate me in a murder I know nothing about. Mr. Sutton's a little nervous, sir, I was merely asking for a statement. I was just trying to get his solicitor. Why, he's been trying to frighten and bully me all night. Well, that won't do here. We don't employ those methods. If Mr. Sutton wants to go, you'll not stop him, Barabal. Thank you. You're not getting away with this. We're not in the Middle Ages, you know. I'm reporting you to the Home Office. And I've got a few things to say to my solicitor about you. Why don't you tell him about yourself, Mr. Sutton? Tell him how that job of yours is a blind. A cover-up for the biggest fence racket in London. You can't talk to me like that. Tell them why you hire ex-convicts. So you can frame them on their records when you find yourself in a hot spot. The way you tried to frame me. I don't care to listen to you. I'm getting out of here! How about Larry Graeme, how you squeaked on him when he wouldn't sell to you. How you saw him at that house tonight when you followed him. - And in your hand you carried this gun. - I never saw it before. You trailed him around the house, down the terrace, through the garden and then you shot him! - That's a lie! - You killed Larry Graeme... ...because he knew who you were and you were afraid! You're mad, Leslie! I never new Larry Graeme. - I wouldn't know him if I saw him! - You wouldn't? Then look! I... I had to kill him. He recognized me that night. I sent you a note. Don't you remember? But he escaped. I was afraid he might get me. I had to kill him. Any further orders, sir? Not only has the capture of the Squeaker... ...led to the reinstatement of Inspector Barabal at Scotland Yard, but this reporter strongly suspects a romantic conclusion to the case. Well, Barabal, I wish you the very best of luck. - Both of you. - Thank you. I hope you two will come to my house one evening and have a drink with me. I'd be delighted. Fine. Well, au revoir. Er, just... Carol, wait just a moment, please, this is very important. Mr. Marshall, did you mean what you just said? - Hm? - About coming to your house? - Certainly. - And having that drink with you? - Of course! - Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you... Thank you. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
