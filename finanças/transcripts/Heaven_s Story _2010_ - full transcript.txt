A long time ago, a monster came to live in the hills. The monster attacked people. In fear, the people asked God for help. But God did nothing to save them. You mean, God just watched? At first the monster did not intend to harm people. It was lonely so it wanted to talk to people walking by. But they reacted to him in fear and fled. The angry monster turned into a fox creature and attacked people. Those who were attacked also became monsters. That's why there were so many monsters. Sato, come on! The water is super salty! This is fun, jump in quick! Hey, why are you looking so bored? Jump in if you want it back. Jump! Jump! Come on. I don't want to. Hurry up and jump! Jump! Jump! Out of the way! The summer sky and pee Sato! Sato, are you OK? Are you OK? Can you swim? Oh, no! Can you swim? Are you OK? This is bad. Hold onto this. She's got it. Are you alright? Sato! You have to come with me! Are you OK? What are you children doing to her? Sato. Out of the way! Can you climb? I don't know the details but let's hurry. Put these on, OK? Change in the car. I'll be back by evening. Be good at Grandma's. You want to go to the toilet? I'll be a minute so wait here for me. How's Sato going? She hasn't talked or cried since the funeral. I can't figure her out. Is Sato going away? She'll live with her granddad. I don't know what to do with her... After my wife died, my daughter and her kids stopped visiting. Sato, let's go. Sato. You'd better go take a pee. Oh, no! You can only do it in your own toilet! You couldn't do it at the sea... I don't have any. What do you mean? Maybe I can never do it again. Don't be silly! If you don't, you'll die! You'll be OK. Right, Sato? Sato! All my family went to see the new high-rise apartments on the hill. Dad, Mom and big sister were all smiling. Only I wasn't happy because I hadn't been able to find my favorite shoes. As usual my big sister Aya tried to comfort me. Is she still cranky? Don't be upset. Those shoes are cute! It's time you snapped out of that mood! Mom! It's a cicada skin! Where? I can't see... There. Oh, so it is! A cicada skin...a lifeless shell. Is it about me? Do kids at school make that face? Stop it! You'll get stuck with that funny face. It's beautiful. It's heavenly. Let's try to get along now that we are living together. We only have each other. You'll have to take care of yourself. Are you listening to me? Ouch... What? Oh...my tummy hurts. Was it something you ate? Where's it hurt? Here? I want some medicine... Stay here. I'll be back. "Pharmacy" Sato! Sato! Sato! On the 22nd of last month, a tragedy struck Mamoru Ogawa and his family. Mamoru Ogawa, his wife and daughter were killed in their living room. The suspect, Seiji Takeda, 36, was found dead in a hotel room. Police found the knife possibly used in the murders. A note found described work grievances the killer had with his victim. The police believe that Takeda killed himself. Dad...Mom...Aya! Next news. The juvenile who killed your family got an indefinite prison sentence. He deserves a death sentence. I'll kill him myself. The boy killed my wife and daughter for no rational reason. "Death penalty ruled out for the minor offender." Even if the law protects him I'm going to kill him myself. My wife and daughter deserved to live a long, fulfilling life! They were both young... with their futures ahead of them. The only retribution for his crime is his own life. "Tomoki Satou" Even if he was a minor at the time of his crime he can't get away with it. He will get just retribution. So you won't appeal? No. Appeals are out of the question. I want him back in society, within my reach as soon as possible. That's all I want. Grandpa... Sato. I've decided not to die. I'll outlive my sister...then my mother. The man I wanted to kill died before I had a chance. Kaya, it feels nice. Kaya! Cherry blossom and a snowman "proxy murder services" "Well retaliate for you" "We'll kill for you." "Sample cases..." "All you have to do is e-mail us." "How can I kill a man to avenge my wife and daughter" "when the man's in prison?" There they are! Kaijima! You're so late! But I didn't miss you! Believe or not, Kaijima was with in the high school judo team. What's your first name again? Never mind. Sit down. Sorry I was late. I brought this! Thank you. Sachin, you made it! How have you been? I've been doing so-so. I could be dead for all I know. Kaijima! Come and sit here. Have a beer. She's Naoko Yokota. She runs my shop. Naoko Yokota! I heard you! She is pretty! And single. Oh, please, guys. Hey you! Want a beer? Let's have a toast! To us. Cheers! Are you still playing baseball? Of course! He's a manager now! Your dream came true! Of a little league team! A manager is a manager. Manager! Here's to you. At the time Mitsuo Aikawa was a socially maladjusted 18-years-old. Aikawa assaulted the victim with a fist-sized rock. The victim was hit 18 times and died as a result. Aikawa had no criminal record or history of violence. when he put my hysterical daughter in the water and strangled her. Taking his problematic childhood into consideration he deserves a chance at rehabilitation. Thereby the court sentences him to serve indefinitely. Look, it's beautiful...! It's a job for the police! Go catch that weirdo. I'll go and take a look. Go with her, Kaijima. Why me? Insanity is contagious! Just go, come on! Hold it! Don't touch him! Leave him alone! Get the paramedics. Let's go! My shoe! Haruki, there's no need to hurry. "Michio and Haruki Kaijima" You have tissues? Sure do! Don't run. You might fall. Don't fall. Haruki. How about a picnic when I get back from my business trip? Okay, a cherry blossom party! Let's do it! Let's do it! What's up? Whoops, wrong way! Don't fall, buddy! Hello! Hello. Hello? Mr. Hada! Mr. Hada! Mr. Hada. Mr. Hada. Mr. Hada? Hey! That was close! Hey! Mr. Hada! That's dangerous! Mr. Hada! Damn it! Asshole! Mr. Hada, give me a break. Hey, come on! This is not a game we're playing. Ha-ha! I fooled Death! It actually worked. The silly look on his face! Death disappeared into thin air. Ha-ha...ha-choo! I've caught a cold. I have a runny nose. Staying up on a cold night... See, Death works at night. If you try to stay up with Death through the night You would catch a cold. It's better than dying. He is toying with me, damn it. Hey! Stop fooling around. Mr. Hada. Mr. Hada! Come out! What's the point of this nonsense? Mr. Hada! Ouch! Are you crazy? Stop, that hurts! You asshole... This will be quick and easy. It'll be like you had a heart attack. Damn it! Hada! Shit! I lived here until I was 9. This is my hometown! This is so much fun! Oh, I'm sweating. When I lived here, it was called Cloud Nine. It was a thriving community back then. But when the mine was shut down, everybody moved to the town below. I'm not here to hear your story. Why don't you surrender to your wife's wish to see you dead! What's her problem? She knows I have terminal cancer. All she has to do is wait for the insurance payout. Right, Mr. Avenger? I don't care about your personal life. I'm just doing my job. You know what? I bet she really hates me. We grew up together. We left here around the same time but we went to different towns. We ran into each other in Tokyo when we were about 20. We've spend the following 20-something years together. But I got kind of full of myself and did something stupid. I cheated on my wife with this young cute girl. Things turned sour after that. As if that's not bad enough, I got cancer. It's incurable. Hey, you talk a lot. None of that is my concern though. Hey! Wait a minute! Don't go away! Stay there! Stay! Mr. Hada! Mr. Hada! There he is. Mr. Hada, we've had enough fun, haven't we? We all have a fixed amount of luck and bad luck assigned to us. Everything is balanced out. On the day I was told I had cancer, I went to a slot machine joint. Slots are not my thing usually, but I won big time! I've never gambled and won but I did that day. That's when I knew how it works. Everything balances out in this world. You keep talking about your cancer. As if you've won the lottery. My wife called me 2 days ago. She told me that she'd sent an assassin after me. I've been on a high since she called. I feel so alive! I want to live now! I even planned to fend you off. I thought that we'd always be together. Yeah, he's here. You're horrible. I had no idea you hated me so much. I never doubted that we'd love each other until the end. It was like I was playing cops and robbers again. "Hello, Mr. Hada has been dealt with." "I'll attach a photo as proof." "Please confirm it and transfer the fee. Regards, Kaijima." You have a child, don't you? Yes, in kindergarten. A boy, or a girl? A boy. A very naughty boy. I'd like to meet him someday. Is that a no? Something happened on my son's third birthday. I got time off to be with him which is rare for patrol cops. I was excited. I stood there alone waiting for the next cop to take over my shift. I was waiting... and a man came up to me. He held out a knife and demanded my gun. He was skinny as a skeleton. I humored him so he wouldn't get agitated. But then he suddenly jumped at me. He reached for my belt, for the gun. We struggled for control. And then I heard a Bam! I looked at him. He was all bloody. And he suddenly started apologizing. He kept saying, I'm sorry. He kept apologizing until the ambulance arrived. They were his last words. "I'm sorry." I had absolutely no idea what in the hell he was apologizing for. It was me who shot him! I was the one. The man died apologizing to me... It turned out that he had a wife and daughter. I visited them to express my condolences. I told them how sorry I was... And then I realized. It was as if he'd taken over me. I was him then. It was like he was apologizing to his family through me. I've been sending a little money to the family ever since. Sorry... This guy I was with at my part-time job was a big talker. I must have picked it up. The cherry blossom petals are falling! Dad, is this a souvenir? It's cold! There might not be cherry trees where we move. So we should enjoy them now. Haruki, what will you say to your new classmates? I'm Haruki Kaijima! The Key Ambulance Raindrops and rock Your security measures are sloppy. I might not even live here. I know you do, I checked your ID. Maybe I broke up with the guy living here so I'm here to set it on fire. I'm just following instructions. What? I do what I'm told. You do whatever you're told to do? So if you were told to kill someone, you would? That's pathetic! Very pathetic! You bitch! Yes, sir. One more house and I'm done for the day. What...rape? It's not true. She wants an apology? If she insists I'll go and see her. OK, let me get a pen. Give me a water. Hurry up! Did you want to speak with me? Just come with me. Who's he, Tae? A locksmith. A locksmith? You want to lecture us now you've got a record deal... Come on... Is playing a big gig any different from playing in a bar? Not at all. I see. What did you think of us tonight? I dare you to answer. It was all right... You sounded OK. We're okay, are we? You're looking down on us. You're not above us. No, I'm not. I have work tomorrow, so... I haven't finished yet. Tae did it again, didn't she... It's like we're not there! She thinks she's so good. She is good but... You'd better tell her tomorrow that she's fired. I can't do that. I wish she'd just quit... Excuse me. I have to go. Wait. I told you not to leave! Take me somewhere that impresses me... Then I'll let you leave. Hey. How did you like our music? I guess you're clueless. Am I right? The rain kept people away last night. It's usually much better...it's unbelievable! Everyone goes crazy. It will kill someone some day. Was it really the rain? What do you mean? What would a locksmith know? Not much. You can't keep blaming the rain or whatever when things go wrong. Maybe it's you... When I was 5, I lost my hearing after I was kicked. Is it my fault that my drunk father kicked me? Can't the partially deaf play rock? Should I sit quietly with the electric hum of a hearing aid? So I won't be blamed? I want to hear sound myself! My own sound! I want to hear it myself! Is that so wrong? It's all my fault! It's me who's wrong! It's me, always me! Everything is my fault! It's always...always...me! Why is it like that? Everything is my fault! A boat, a bike and a cicada skin Where's this place? Is it far? It's next to the Seagulls. What? Past the pier where the seagulls are. OK. Is this yours? Can I borrow it? Why don't you walk? You're not using it. Make sure you return it. "Tomoki, Tae and Yuka Satou" Home, sweet home! Hello. We're home! I'm home! What's that? A dead bug. It's a cicada skin. A grown cicada shed it. Did you learn that at school? So it's not dead? It's just a skin. What are you doing here all day, kid? The name's Haruki Kaijima. I like looking at people's faces as they come and go. Is that your idea of fun? What do you mean by fun? You're weird. What's your name? I'm Sato. Sato. I need your bike again. Hello. I'm home. Hi, Daddy! What? I see. I get your point. I noticed recently that all I ever do is work. So this is God's way of telling me to take a break. That's how I see it. What? Don't worry! Yes, I said God. It's not like that. What? I'll find another job easily! I'm not being offhand. I'm trying to be positive. It's a great chance for the 3 of us to have some quality time. Let's go to that place...that... The hot spring you said you wanted to go. For rheumatism. Ouch! Stop it, brat! It hurts! You thief! Stop right there, you punk! Stop running! You punk! I've got you! I'm going to beat the hell out of you! Does it hurt, you asshole? It hurts half as much as you hurt me! Get up, punk. I'm not finished yet! Come on, punk. Get up! "7am through 6pm everyday Closed for the day" Have a nice day! Bye, guys. Bankrupt... Domestic violence... A whore... I found another good one! You did too! Wait! Stop! Lift your leg up very carefully. I'm sorry. Oh, boy... What should I do? I saw one here when my daughter and I came here. There it is. Get up on me. Did you get it? More to the right, please. - A little more. - There. Did you get it? I got it. Good. What's wrong? Why haven't you killed him? The killer's out of prison now. What? You mean you didn't know? Already! It's too early... I checked the newspapers daily. I looked at every article for news of the killer's murder. But I never found it. He's still alive! The man who killed your family! He's out there somewhere laughing and enjoying his life. Don't you care? Is it because you're happy now? Your new wife and kid love you... Have you forgotten the dead? Who are you...? I'm your fan. You've been my hero for many years. It makes no sense... Who sent you? Did a journalist send you here? Nothing like that! Leave me alone. Pass that on. When your family's murdered, aren't you entitled to happiness? I don't think so. Mr. Kaijima, keep your eye on him. If your son keeps skipping school he might have to repeat a year. The school doesn't want to be involved in any more trouble. I'm very sorry about everything. I'll talk with him. OK. I'm going this way. Good-bye. I'm really sorry. You look silly. Take this. Thanks for the bike. Hi, Honey. What's wrong? Nothing. You did it for money? Even if you wanted money, you can't steal from people. You might just be a kid but you're also the son of a cop. You could get me fired... Shut up. I'm getting the hell out of here! This place is the pits! I need money. Give me some if you don't want me to steal! I have to go. Where to? I'll be right back. Wait a minute, Tomoki! Let's eat. Okay! OK, Yuka. Let's say thanks. Thank you for the food. I forgot to tell Daddy. What did you forget? You forgot? Sorry. Thank you. Sorry! Sorry! End of the Heaven's Story Act 1 Intermission Act 2 Cabbages. Carrots. Peppers. Cabbages. A leaf and dolls I know this must come as a shock. All we can do is delay your symptoms. The damage can't be reversed. There's no cure for the disease. A cure might be developed some day. It's a race against time for patients with early onset Alzheimer's. You may not be able to take care of yourself. In that case, is there anyone who take care of you? You'll need help eventually. Sorry... I can't help it...this is funny. As his attorney I'd go for a retrial and get a reduced sentence. But the Defendant doesn't want to appeal. So the Defendant is guilty? It doesn't mean that. But he'd appeal if he wasn't guilty. "An indefinite sentence for the then 19-year-old." "No appeal" Here's a statement by the Defendant. I promised him that I'd read it. "I also want to be remembered by the unborn." Is that all? Yes. I also want to be remembered by the unborn. That's all I have. Don't you have anything else? "Indefinite sentence, no appeal" "...for the mother and baby homicide" Come again. Feeling OK, Ms. Terashima? You've never missed a delivery before. Sorry. You lock yourself up all day making dolls... If you came in here for coffee you could meet people. I have a table set up for you. Lots of my customers are waiting for your new dolls. Are you OK? I don't know where I live... Excuse me? I don't know where I am... Where am I? OK, let's get off the road. Come with me to the station. Are you OK? I'll help you. Let me park the bike. Prison visits are limited to a select few. The identity of minors can not be revealed. You can not meet him. How about a letter... Can I write to him? What are you after? If it's just curiosity...! I also want to be remembered by the unborn! I have to know what kind of person would say that! Maybe it's true, I am being inquisitive. He killed a woman, raped her post mortem and strangled an infant. That's his crime. Do you really understand that? Yes. Give the letters to me. I'll make sure he gets them. But don't expect any replies. "How do you do? My name is Kyoko Terashima." I had panic attacks when I was a child. When I die, the world will go on without me. I can't imagine the world after I'm gone. That thought scared me so much I couldn't sleep. How about now? I'm not scared anymore. Because I've come to accept it. We can accept anything. Doctor... I've been trying to find a memory that I couldn't bear to forget... But... I can't think of any. Nothing at all! "As winter approaches, it's become cold. I trust you're well." "This morning I found thin ice in a bucket I'd left outside." "It reminded me of ice I made as a kid with paint and water." "I'll call you "No-name Gonbe". Is that OK to call you?" "You don't write so I'll assume it's okay..." "No-name Gonbe, I grew up in a mining boomtown in the middle of nowhere." "It no longer exists." "Where I live now, there's a high rise condo on the hill." "It has great views, you can see many small towns from there." "The view makes me feel tranquil." "Something about it reminds me of my childhood." I have a reply, Ms. Terashima. "Dear, Kyoko Terashima, how do you do? My name is Mitsuo Aikawa." "Thank you very much for all the letters." "The cherry blossom's out." "I guess there must be some blossom over the wall." "Petals fly into the yard." A cherry blossom party! Cherry blossom! Yeah, a cherry blossom party! Haruki, it won't go away! Cherry blossom! Yes, that's right. His mom killed herself when he was 13. He grew up with no parental love. His dad's a bit of a no-hoper. He doesn't visit his son nor write. Even if he got parole, he wouldn't be coming back to much. And he has accepted your offer? No, not yet. Maybe I shouldn't... I also want to be remembered by the unborn. I thought those words were written by someone suicidal. I was afraid he'd kill himself in prison... I wanted to prevent that. One of my clients ended up killing himself. I won't let it happen again. I can see how your letters have changed him. How do you do? I'm Kyoko Terashima. Just try to think of the adoption as a formality. I just thought it would help you... I'm babbling... Sorry. I'm sorry. Well... I agreed to this because I wanted to see you. Really? What's your impression, then? What am I saying...! I'm sorry. I don't want you to die. Because I've got to know you. And now that we've met too. That's why... That's why I want you to live. Mr. Akiyama, I'll wait outside. Thank you very much. Is it good? You thief... Give me my sweets back. Give them back to me! Give them back! Give them back to me! Kyoko, stop! Give them back to me! OK, just stop! Who are you? "Wash your hands after using the toilet" Who are you? Go to the end of the hall and go right. Coming through. This way please. Our patients with dementia are on the second floor. Some patients live here and some are here temporarily. Keep going. It's cloudy today but you can see the ocean from here. Just a moment please... Hello! What was your snack today? The ones we got? That's right. Did you forget after you ate it? What we got at 3? 3 o'clock. Yes. What did you eat at 3? I don't remember. I just ate it... Was that cake or something else? Dumplings? Isn't this yours, Yoshiko? Mine's a bun. That's right! Drink lots of water. Otherwise you'll get sick. Keeps your blood clean. It would be nice spending your days watching the ocean. As I told you, she might have better days but she won't recover. So Kyoko will keep losing her memory until she remembers nothing. Nothing at all. And that's the end of it. No! Just consider this place as an option if she's too much... Food...that's mine. Give it back to me! It's too much to ask, Kimura. Have a heart, Shioya. He's trying to make up for his errors, he nurses a woman with dementia... His crime is unforgivable! A woman and a baby! He would have hung if he'd been an adult. Aikawa. I'm going. What's that attitude! Sorry Shioya, I apologize for him. You'd better apologize, too. That attitude will make people think that you'll kill again! Everybody's scared of you! Hi. I'll fix dinner now. Mitsuo. I think I should go to a nursing home. This is too much for you. Kyoko, you look very good today. Look what I've got! There's nothing. No...l had it in my palm just now. Kyoko. Did you adopt me because you needed someone to take care of you? You said you didn't want me to die. But you just wanted to use me. Mitsuo, do you remember? On the day we first met you saw this and said, Thank you. I loved your voice when you said that. And I loved your face too... All I want is for you to remember... It'll be OK. You'll be OK, Kyoko. Nothing has changed at all. You'll be OK. So please... Please stay here. Mitsuo. Did you really kill someone? Christmas presents Sorry I was late to give you this. Mr. Kaijima, you don't have to keep doing this. No, it's nothing. Kana... I need some for your medical bills. Hello, are you here already? OK. I'm sorry... You should forget about what happened to my husband. My daughter and I think of him less and less. I'll be going now. I'll be right there. No cell phones here. Bug off. I'll be back! How long are you going to keep giving us money? I don't know how long it will be... I remember. When you first came to our house, you said you'd pay until I was on my own. Did I say that? Yes. I guess I did, then. Well I'm an adult now. How old are you? 25. You're 25! Then you shouldn't bother your mom. She might be your stepmom but a kid's always a kid. Give me a Christmas present. What? It's Christmas time! You treat me like a child. So give me something! I have nothing... It's a joke, dummy. Kana! Kana, wait up! Here you are. Why? What is this thing? It's Peepo. A police mascot. He has parents, too. And little sister, Peeko and brother Peetah. He even has grandparents. So...? So...it's your family! What the hell? Take it. Merry Christmas! Who's he? Mr. Suzuki! Move it, Mr. Suzuki! Move faster. Where do I bring this? Use your brain. Mr. Suzuki, over here. I'll put it here. OK. Stop! You thief! Stop there! You! Stop, punk! Leave me alone! Keep away! Get off me, you assholes! Don't stop me! I made it! Where's the train? They've stopped. Somebody jumped. I want to go home! It's been happening a lot. What's this for? You bought us a drink? Merry Christmas. Damn, that's awesome. No, thank you. Why not? Don't you drink, Aikawa? Right, you couldn't drink in the prison... Try it. It's good. It helps you forget bad things. - He's right. - Go for it. Let's drink. Oh, thank you. Can we have this too? Thank you. Go on. Drink up. First time, huh! Look at him. He can drink. You're all right. What the hell! Goddammit! Mr. Kuroda, you'd better give up. Why...? Why are you after me? You know why. You did something that turned people against you. I'm not the only one to blame, Goddamn it! Life is about taking responsibility for your actions. This is a part-time job for me. l don't want complications. Don't give me trouble. Just die please. Sit here. So are you married? Oh, the ring? I was married but the wife ran away. I can't get the damn thing off. Hello? What? Oh, my God! Is Haruki OK? Is he OK now? Sato! Come out, Sato! I found you, Sato! Don't go away. Where are you going? Don't leave us! Give it back to me! Give it back to me! What's this? Could it be a Christmas present? No, gross! For a guy? Let her go! Cut it out! Let me go! Get off her! Hello. It's time to go. Where am I? The others have left already. I was paid overtime. I felt sorry for you. You paid for the other guys, too. You don't remember? Too bad. Watch out for Suzuki. He's no good. Come again. Thank you. Aikawa! What are you up to? Have you ever come to apologize to me? I've been busy. What? You know...I've been preoccupied with things. You're busy? Couldn't you write? Couldn't you call? Hey! You! My life has been hell because of you! If an apology was enough I would have done it already. What did you say? What did you say! What did you..! You killed them... How could you say that! Where is Haruki? - Are you his father? - Yes. How come you're so late? I'm sorry. He's in there. Thank you. Did you see him? Things got worse after I said I'd kill him.. Up until then the media supported me. That changed. The District Attorney stopped me from appealing for a death sentence. He said I had no chance. All the people who'd backed me turned against me. I failed to protect them. That's what I was supposed to do... But I couldn't protect my wife and my daughter... How would I go on...? I didn't know what I was living for anymore. You made up your mind. Good. Do you want some coffee? Merry Christmas. I've come here tonight to say goodbye to you. I'm going away for some time. But you don't have to worry, Kyoko. I'll keep sending your hospital fees. I'll be away but I'll be thinking about you. So there's nothing for you to worry about. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas... You're late. Sorry. Are you seeing someone? Don't bring her over! I'm not seeing anyone. I can't hear you! I can't hear you! I don't want to hear you! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Marry Christmas... What are you looking at? You're spooking me. Do you know what today is? What is it? It's not your birthday. It's Christmas Eve. Duh, what's that got to do with me? I have something for you. You do. Come on, don't hide under the blanket. Look. Where is it, liar? I had a talk with Santa yesterday. I told him to make it snow for you. Liar. It's true. Because he owes me one. Why's that? I let him off last year. He was speeding. Liar! Thank you. I got it. Don't worry. Kyoko, do you remember it here? This is your hometown. "Kyoko Terashima" The man I wanted to kill died before I had a chance. The closest town to heaven Part 1 - Revenge I think you should stay behind. I appreciate all your help. But this concerns me. No! I'll come with you. I've been waiting for today. I've spent my life waiting for this day. I've been to many places since I left you, Kyoko. Hakata, Kokura, Himeji, Akashi, Tottori, Osaka... I've done all sorts of jobs. I worked with reinforced concrete, I laid bricks... I lived at an inn, serving food, making beds. I've got muscles now. Are you listening? That was the second time I'd traveled that much. When I was a child, I was badly abused by my father. When Mom died, he got worse. When I was 18 I ran away from home and traveled all over Japan. It wasn't like sightseeing. I was more like a bum. During that time I thought a lot about my dead mother. What is death? Luck has got nothing to do with it. There's no warning. I noticed that death comes out of blue. That's when... I killed them. Killing somebody is kind of easier than you think. It's humans who call it a crime. But it's far more powerful. It's a force that smothers our morals. It's a ferocious monster. That's how I tried to see it. Am I right...? I could never tell. Actually it doesn't matter if I'm right or not. It's like this place. In a few decades, it'll be covered with plants. It'll be swallowed up. Nobody will even believe it had been a town. I know, Kyoko. Let's live here, you and I. I can fix it up. We can live in one of the apartments here. It'll be OK because nobody's here to tell us what to do. No one to tell us off. Let me go! Let me go! How could you love such a man? He only agreed to be with you so that he could get out of prison. Aikawa! Aikawa! Mitsuo Aikawa! Mitsuo Aikawa! I see, you two are the same. You wanted him to take care of you. You were using each other. But he is a murderer. So he has to die. Please don't...! Stop it! You don't deserve to live! I'm going to build a town here! For Kyoko and me... That's bullshit! Die! Die! Die! Die, die! Tomoki! Tomoki. She's not breathing. Kyoko! Please... Kyoko. Please wake up. Open your eyes, Kyoko. Please. Please! Open your eyes! Are you OK, Tomoki? Get in. - Let me push it over. - OK. Take it easy. Hold it there. Put it down now. What's in it? I don't care. I'll move it, go back, and get paid. Get paid, get laid... Yeah, maybe. No playing around? The money goes to my wife. It's a once-in-a-100-year recession. Damn, ouch! What's this? What is this? What the hell? What's going on? - That son of a bitch! - What is it? Whose body is this? Who is this? I'm going. Son of a bitch! Where are the keys? Give me the keys to the van! The keys, come on! That son of a bitch! Goddamn it! Give me the goddamn keys! What will we do? Forget it! Wait a minute! Shut up! You're too much, you idiot. Die! Wait. Stupid woman! Wait a minute! You're annoying! Don't come after me! Why are you going? Shut up! Wait for me! Wait... Do what you like! Go fuck yourself, bastard! Wow, this is moving. You want to sit? Let's sit. - You can't eat her! - I'm going to! - She doesn't have any meat! - Okay then. Come on! Come on! Yuka, listen. Daddy has fallen apart. So from now it's you and Mommy, just the two of us. - OK? - Yeah. - OK. - OK Home is that way. Bye, home. Bye, home. Bye, home. The closest town to heaven, Part 2 - Avenging the avenger I'm here to meet a man called Kaijima. What do you want? He hasn't paid us. He promised he'd support us until I was on my own. But he stopped paying recently. What's funny? Because the man you're looking for has died. Of course he can't pay. Liar! He had some seedy part-time job. I guess somebody wanted him dead. There. Where's his money? Cops took the bankbooks and anything money-related. Move! You'll find nothing. The cops were thorough. Where is it! Hey. Can't you tell me... Why do people die...? How do I look? This is your wife's. I'll fix some food. You haven't eaten anything, Tomoki. Aren't you scared? Why should I be? We killed a person. But we all die in the end. What's wrong? That guy killed your wife and kid! You did the right thing. You're still a child. You understand nothing. I'm not a child. I love you, Tomoki! I love you. No, you can't... I'm not afraid of you! You don't scare me! Do you hear me? I know you've been parking here for days. I know what you're up to. I understand men like you. Do you really understand me? I do. Thank you. I think you should drive away. Mr. Satou, do you hear me? On that day... I followed your wife pushing your baby in a stroller. I followed her to the river. And hit her over and over. I killed your wife. Then I noticed your baby was crying. I panicked. I picked her up. And put her in the water. Your wife's profile reminded me of my mom, who died when I was a child. They were similar? Is that the only reason? The reason... I've given it a lot of thought. But the reason... The true reason... I don't really know. I'm sorry. It feels as if the air around me bristles. When I talk, my tongue stings... My skin feels burned. If I didn't have Kyoko maybe I would have killed again. Kyoko was different. She had so much warmth. But you... You...! took her away. You killed her. I know it's very selfish of me. I took the lives of your wife and your daughter. Who am I to hate you for taking Kyoko from me? Now you understand. Now you know how these years have been for me. Now you know how much I hate you. It's too late! I've got to piss. Are you OK? Sure. What kind of father was he? I guess he was a regular kind of dad. The kind who would buy a Christmas present on New Year's day. And that's regular? Yes, I think it is. He was also OK to hang out with. Tomoki! What? When is it coming? Soon, I guess. That's why I need money. What are you doing? Hand over your money! What are you looking at? I'll shoot! I'll shoot you. You'll die. Don't. Give me that. It's dangerous. I said I'd shoot! You're having a baby. It's not good. It's not good for the baby. Stay away! Stay away from me! Stop it! It's bad for the child! I'll move the car so get her out of the way. That baby belongs to us all. Somebody! Somebody help! Help! Please help her! Help! What's wrong? She's having a baby. A baby? Call an ambulance now! She's having a baby. This is no prank! Between Seagull and Rainbow apartments. That's right, come quick! How is she? Come on. Why don't we stop now... Tomoki. ...sorry. No! Don't leave me! It hurts...! It'll be OK. It hurts! Tomoki! Tomoki! No! No! I can see the baby's head. You're doing great. Almost! Well done! Congratulations, you have a beautiful baby! I think it's a girl. It's a girl. No! Heaven's Story Haruki Kaijima? Who are you? I know your father. He's dead. I'll carry your bag. I know. I was told. No need to worry. There will be lots of kids there like you. I'm not worried about anything! I'll visit you. Wait a minute. I'm ready, here we go. OK, who's going to the kindergarten? Me! Good, all aboard and off we go! All aboard! All aboard! What do you want to do at kinder? To fold paper. That's nice. Mommy wants to sing many songs. Wow, watch it! Be good or we won't make it to kinder. No! You want to fold paper animals. Paper animals, paper animals, Let's sing songs too! It was when you just turned 3. Something you said surprised me. You said you remembered being born. You came through darkness to the light. You touched something warm. You could tell that it was my body. You told me that was how you were born. 10 years after they were killed I went through their belongings. I found a letter Mother had written to me. There was a strange address on the envelope... Wait! Do you think God exists? I have to get off! Aya! The story that won't end With the end of your life The family who survived Will understand you in the end But the sins you committed They will never forgive The pain that can't be erased Heavy on their shoulders But they will not wish For your life to end A child is born as A man is killed The town lies beneath heaven As if nothing happened A story as old as time Since the beginning of man In the kitchen full of light Where we embraced for the first time The hero died long ago The war continues across the sea Every thing seemed Like it existed for TV Never imagined my own child Would ever commit murder Remember the very first light That you ever saw? The feeling of a touch, Of something very warm? Heaven's Story Heaven's Story Heaven's Story An ongoing story from Before your life even began Of a war that began to Stop a horrible monster Of a lie promising happiness, Killing millions of people Even a hint of freedom Cannot be seen But the nightmare of bloodshed Never seems to cease Watching over us, You're up there above the clouds And now you have descended With a pair of wings on your back Directed by ZEZE Takahisa Subtitles by Dean Shimauchi
