LD. number 22754079. -Yes. Date of birth: August 7th... -Yes. Marrie ? -Widowed. Any children? One. When did you have her? -I'm 34. Good. I see that Dr. Kugel booked Dr. Rom as your surgeon. He's excellent. Dr. Shohat, I don't understand why Dr. Kugel wants me to have surgery. My biopsy results were good. A biopsy could be misleading. You have to do it. When it comes to the pancreas you can't take chances. The tumor is too large. I suggest chemotherapy before the surgery, in order to shrink the tumor. Would I have to keep getting chemo after the surgery? Yes, plus radiation therapy. Doctor... Are there any side-effects? Infection, inflammation, injury, excessive bleeding, fatigue, hair loss, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and oral ulcers. However... all those side effects go away in between treatments and disappear completely once the treatment is over. Mrs. Levy, the good news is the tumor is located on the sides of the pancreas vessel. The odds of a malignant tumor returning after the treatment are slim. Zehava, you know I love you. I never asked anything from you but now that I'm sick, I won't take the medication until you're pregnant. Twice a day during meals. I don't want to die like your father. -But I can't do it alone. Then do it by other means. 3 times a day after meals. You want me to have a baby from a sperm bank? Do it with a friend, someone you know, a neighbor, someone from the street. Once a day, before bed time. Mom, I want to fall in love. I am... sick. 654.98 NIS, please. I have nothing to look forward to anyway! Hello. -Hello. Where to?' -My'daughter. Zehava'le! My sweetheart. I brought you your medication. Don't talk about my disease, it'll scare off the customers. yVon't you introduce us? -Seme other time. Sweetie, I'm sorry for lashing out on you at the pharmacy. I'm just under a lot of stress with this treatment. Do you forgive me? -I do. Please take the medication. -Zehava, please... There's no point in going through all this suffering. I want it to be over quickly. I want to die pretty. Mom, you'd throw your life away out of fear of being ugly? I beg you, take the medication. Don't be stubborn. I feel that I can't beat this disease. Perhaps I'd be willing to go through all this agony if I knew I had something to live for, to see my grandchild. -Mom, you'll have a grandchild. I won't have the strength to go through this treatment before you get pregnant. Mom! Noam... Who's Mommy's sweetheart? Hi, Noam. Zehava cried even though she wasn't hurt. Remember how sometimes you cry out of happiness? She's not happy. Come here. Noam saw you crying. I know what I did. I remember myself... You're depressing the kids. My mom's forcing me to get pregnant. You got to meet Shaul. I'm not going on blind dates. Prefer the sperm bank? Screw you! You've ruined my evening. I wanted you to babysit for me. Who are you calling? -The father of your children. Hey, honey, what's up? Yeah, take this number down. 054-302787. Her name's Zehava. She's dying to meet you. You'll be thrilled to meet her. Dekel's mom said she'll come at 6 pm. I e-an't slay past 5 pm. I have a fitting. I can't close the kindergarten because'of Aliza's wedding. Decide which of you two stays. Dekel, Dekel... Tell Odelia you're sorry. Are you alright? There you go, Ma'am. It's from the man with the hat. Rafi Sarusi. -Zehava Levy. Nice to meet you. Zehava, I like your style. You're sitting in Shauls seat. See his name anywhere? -Shaul is my blind date. I saw you first. Shaul has to sleep with me. Poor thing. How could you do that to him? I have to get pregnant. Good luck to the both of you. Zehava? -Good evening. Good indeed. You have the same beauty mark as Noam. -I'm his dad. You have a nutty ex-wife. -I'm still a man. You're Noam's dad. Kochi told me you're crazy about him. How come you never come to pick Noam up? Do you expect me to cook for him too? Why did you get divorced? Next question. Waitress! "Chivas". -And you, Ma'am? I'm good I'm waiting for an answer. -I was her man. Then why did you get divorced? -She stopped adoring me. You are really full of yourself. -Yes. She thought so too. I want you to make me a baby. Sure thing, honey. Whatever you want. But after that, I don't ever want to see you again. You never took it up the ass? Tell me, do you prefer a girl or a boy? The order was placed with no particular preference. I'd prefer a daughter. How about we call her Liem? Hello? ~ /-Surprise! Hang on, sweetie... Basbusa? Bambi.. Basbusa.. Are you drunk? Make me explode... It'll be risky to smoke around you... Give me some! I've never seen you wasted like this. Tve no idea what you're doing in my bed "but as long as you're here, hang the laundry "and you're invited to a wedding tonight. "Kisses. Basbusa." Good morning! I got a "dating dog". It doesn't suit you to live with a furry animal. I have to get married this year. There you go... Think he's keeping that monster so he can marry you? My puppy's a honey trap. Your puppy will look like a big donkey in 6 months. I'll let you have it in two weeks. Zehava? -Did you hang the laundry? You should have ordered a dryer instead. Behave and I'll give some after the wedding. Zehava. -What? Dekel's mom said she'll get here at 6 pm. What a hottie. Damn! I'm invited to a wedding. -Oh, really? May you get hitched too. -Where are you? 5 minutes.-Don't piss me off, I need you tonight. Bye I'm getting pregnant tonight. Gadi will marry you the day I grow mammoth teeth. Last night he gave me a bouquet. Got a good deal. A call girl would've cost him more. I don't want him, I want his sperm. What will you do with his sperm? Make an omelet? What's wrong? I'm sorry It's time you found someone serious. My mom refuses to take her medication unless I get pregnant. Poor thing... What does she have? -Cancer. Tonight, among family and friends, in a festive ceremony with a wedding dress in accordance with Jewish law, you and I, a bride and a groom. We fortify our love against our cruel arch-enemy. And even if we die in the end, we won't surrender, we'll fight back. We will wash dishes and have a little kid which will be a thorn in his side. Of all the men in the world, only with you I felt I wanted to have a child. Strolling in the yard, laughing at a funny-shaped cloud with wise' eyes that resemble yours and a mischievous look in an old photo. My good man, your happiness will be redeemed with my freedom. I will cherish your spirit, your heart and your desire without lamenting over my sacrifice. I will fight each day anew for my right to be your wife because I found out I'm miserable without you. Welcome, my groom! You're a bouquet of primal scents. Curiosity tickles my womb. I am fully prepared to give you life. Repeat after me: "If I forget thee, O Jerusalem... "let my right hand wither... "let my tongue cleave to my palate... "if I do not remember you... "if I do not set Jerusalem... "above my highest joy." Mazal tov! Bambi, I want you to make me a baby. Felin had twins. Wait here. Mazal tov! Mazal tov! -Thank you. How's my ring? He adores the smell of my cunt! Got it made a decade before me! Don't envy her, it'll cost her. Where's that delicious guy you came with? Have you seen the guy I came with? -There he is. He's not in the men's room. I checked all the stalls. Don't worry, I won't tell your parents. I don't feel a thing. Why don't you teach her a trick or two? My grandma is a widow. If you're interested, I'll give you her number. Will you make me a baby? I'm not Grandpa Geppetto... I'll sign whatever you want. No one will ever know. Be kind to him. Give him a piece of ass so some young chick won't steal him. You're a piece of work! Whoever's job it was, he knocked off you at least 40 years! You pedophile! You can seduce God! I could have emptied your house without you noticing. How are you feeling? Do you want to die? I won't take that medication until you're pregnant! Why did you place an ad with my phone number? -I want to live. I'm getting offers non-stop. Take the medication. I had you when I was 25. By the time I was your age I was no longer menstruating. At least give me a few days. Are you in pain? This disease is killing me. You look great. Because I'm happy knowing you're finally going to be pregnant. Good morning. Nadav, the new kindergarten teacher. -Nice to meet you. Zehava. How much do you make? I'm a volunteer, I'm allergic to money. We better be on the same page. Aliza's on her honey moon. She'll be back next week. Ruthie has extended her honeymoon indefinitely. Welcome! Good luck! -Thank you. Does the newlywed know she's lost her income? -No. I didn't have the heart to fire her before the wedding. Poor thing. What was the reason for firing her? Marital consummation? Pregnancies, check-ups, vacations and lateness. Aliza got married earlier so her belly won't give her away. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know the bride's knocked up. What's next? Now they'll be introduced to each other? Excuse me... Allow me, please. I'm the only one welcoming the kids in the morning. Do you have a light? She didn't buy into your lie. Come here, Dekel. Come, sweetheart. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom... Come on, Gali! Go already, you're only encouraging him. Come here, Dekel. -Mom... Come here, Dekel! Bye! Bye, Mom! See you later. -Mom, Mom... Dr. Shohat! Good morning. -I don't see patients in the street. Make an appointment. -I'm Rachel Levy's daughter. We were at your clinic. Oh, right, your mom is the one with the horrible disease. I won't lie to you, I'm not optimistic. My mom refuses to take the medication you prescribed. She's hastening her death. -Could you tell her that she's making her condition worse. Sweetie, if a patient wants to kill herself, I'm just as good as the next guy. I don't make house calls. I don't chat with patients on the phone. I suggest you go to your family doctor and ask him to refer her to a psychiatrist. She wants me to get pregnant. Do you have a problem conceiving? I can't do it alone. Maybe I can help... after al . You can give me a medical confirmation that I'm pregnant. I can also keep any other chick out of your territory. Here's 2,000 dollars. Sweetie, you're going to get in trouble with the police. I'd be willing to go to jail to get my mom to take her medication. What will you do when she finds out the truth? I'll be pregnant by then. Find a man of good deeds who will do the deed and do whatever it takes to get pregnant instead of inducing me to commit a crime. Hi, honey, this is Haim Bar. If you're, a se^y discreet wgijnan with bi^su *pt'W®ustbneasts, I will hurpp you till you get sperm cominglouit of youif ears. So don't be a fool, call and you'll drool over my giant tool. Hello, my name is Itzik and I'd be willing toget you pregnant for 22,000 NIS. Obviously you'd prefer a philanthropist. In case you change your mind or want an upgrade service, I'll take care of you ike a real lover. What are you looking at? Anyway, have a gorgeous baby. Itzik Mazor. There are two types of feminist girls: One who makes a career and don't shave her armpits and one who don't make a career and don't shave her armpits. Which type are you? Wait for me in the toilets and'you'll find out. No way with a rubber. No way, sis. I don't know who you slept with lately. I want the real thing. -Sis... You can get pregnant. I'm on the pill. What else are you on? Do you take horny guys? Fuckers? Sex maniacs? I have a wife and two kids at home! Want me to suck you off? I'm saving desert for the veggies. Tell Ruthie we had a pedagogical disagreement. And that I had to leave. Come here, come here... Fetch the ball. Very good Very good! Zehava.. How's your mother? What's wrong? Cot warts on your vocal chords? What's that? I can see your tonsils! And I'll die before my mother. Get in, I'll get you something to cover that up. Come in. What did you do to yourself? Aliza's substitute raped me. Maybe now you'll get pregnant. Yeah, right... He raped me from behind with a condom. Do you know her? She thought... that when she'd meet the man of her life she'd pee and pass out of joy. Today no one recognizes her but she pees uncontrollably... What about giving me something? Here. Cover yourself with that until you close that gap. "Exposure to a variety of musical styles." Come to the garden A wedding is taking place Come to the garden A wedding is taking place Samba, Samba Samba-la-la Green and red pepper are wed... Who is it? -Agenda. His teeth are coming out and his gums are irritable. He's eating the couch. I don't have the heart to lock him up. Cute! What's your name? -Agenda. Mommy's going to cut off your balls. -I'll never do it! You better give him away before he gets a hard on. I have a date with my soul mate. He's our neighbor for 9 years and thanks to Agenda, I found him. He bit me! Hello? -Hello, Zehava? -It's Itzik Mazor. Did you get my message ? Yeah, good to hear from you. What do you think? For 22,000 NIS I can get a bathtub full of sperm. The price is flexible but you'll have to settle for less. OK. It's real urgent. Come to me to Rimonim Prison and we'll close the deal. You're a warden... I'm doing time for sexual harassment. So how do you figure we do it, telepathy? By using the ovulation kit, we can ambush the egg at a perfect timing. Thank you very much, I've already been raped today. What are you on that you're so popular? Jail's overcrowded with philanthropists. My VP... his wife... She asked me to be their surrogate mother. I'd rather raise my child myself. Thanks. Wait.. are you going to get pregnant from a criminal? He reached me through your ad in the paper. Take me home! Are you giving up on the pregnancy? The Levys? -Nice to meet you. This is my mother, Rachel. Hello, Mrs. Levy, nice to meet you. Mom, this is Itzik. Why is your hard-on worth 22,000 NIS? Feel the goods and see for yourself. I'd offer you a "tasting event" but it would be at the expense of your grandchild's event. I'm not some defrosted slimy liquid in a tube. She'll be praying the sperm won't get her pregnant. I'll fuck you till you drop! I'll stick your legs in the air and fuck you up the ass till you lose control of your sphincters. Your heart will palpitate as if you've won the lottery! Bravo, bravo, bravo! If you're such a hotshot, why are you doing time for a sex crime? I can give you recommendations from women across the country. Here, clients who came back to me a second and third time. Women who think it's important that their kids will have the same parents. A world-class stud... I'm not some anonymous donor whose kids are considered bastards till their dying day. With me, your grandchild... could get married... without worrying about incest. Pardon me a seconc. Couldn't you find someone more decent? There's this gay guy who wants joint fatherhood with his partner. Thank God your father's dead. Mom, I need time to find someone more decent. Carmela, does your VP's offer still stand? Would you give them your baby? I can't find someone decent to make me a baby. They're willing to pay a lot of money for this. Talk to them and get back t® me. Bye Morning! -Good morning! What? Zehava dragged me to Ramla Prison to meet some rapist with a boot sized too . Now I understand why she turned me down. -What? What? -And some psychopath broke her teeth. Bygones... Think about the cutie Zehava will bring you. What? My grandkids know these stories by heart. Today you can't get them in stores. I'll loan a book from Ran and Rotem from time to time. Maybe Zehava won't be able to conceive. Cheli nka.. My son was a sex addict. Wouldn't hear of getting married. I told him the inheritance would be divided among the grandkids. Today he's married with two children. I'd cut off Zehava from my inheritance but she wouldn't care. She's allergic to money. Chelinka, my son needed encouragement' from someone he trusted. If you want Zehava to act on her impulses, you as a mother, as a parent, have to support her. You have to! Come to the garden A wedding is taking place Samba, Samba Samba-la-la Green and red pepper are wed... Hi! Congratulations! -Thank you. The kindergarten's full, I don't have room for injjjj.trators... You ruined my surprise? -I couldn't resist... Please bring me a confirmation that you're pregnant. I got it. I hope Avi's mom didn't put it in the laundry by accident... Never mind, get me a copy. Otherwise, you're fired. That lizard fired me! Get a fake confirmation until you get pregnant. Like hell... I won't be a criminal to work for a lizard. Hello? -Hello, it's Gali, Dekel's mom. Hi, Dekel's mom. Zehava, tell Dekel I'll pick him up at 18:00. Want to tell him yourself? No, I don't want to hear him cry. Zehava... -Dalya? Hi. Nice to meet you. Isn't this place... discreet enough for you? Checking out the goods before presenting them to your husband? I'm choosing my genetic replacement. And I'm supposed to do it with a pig in a poke? I'll take care of you if you promise to give me the baby right after delivery. What will I tell my mother? That I sold her grandchild? How can you be so sure you won't want the baby? I want to save my mother. I have no intention of nurturing or spreading your husband's genes. Then you have no problem signing that you're giving up the baby. I'll sign whatever you want, only you don't get the baby before my mom dies. OK. Good. Hello. Hello. -Hello. Please come in. This is Micha, my husband. I feel like a virgin. Is that why you brought "mommy" along? We decided that I'll be involved at all stages from the very beginning. I'm not having an orgy. I won't get in the way. I'll wait outside. You'll hear everything. I groan like a slaughtered animal. Make the whole town go deaf. He's more effective when I'm vocal. I'm going to "water" that. I need to check the quality of the water... She's not pregnant. -So far. Knock on the door when you're ready. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. Someone has to do the dirty work. Who is it? Micha. Are you alone? Yes. Come in. What a glorious welcome. Let's get down to work. Want to do it dressed or undressed? I'm not Mary and you're not God so we better try undressed. Hot stuff! Is something on fire? I had a complete permanent hair removal. Do you have a split personality? Once we get used to the transformation up there, I'll clear everything down there. Let me know when you come. I can't perform while my wife's eavesdropping behind the door. Take your socks off. Think about helping her extend the family. I help her all the time but not when she's lurking behind the door. What? You don't give up on other women for your wife? Other women save my marriage life. Does your wife know? a woman doesn't understand it, she gets divorced. I think this nice fellow agrees with you... I finish work at 4 pm. Work's no chastity belt. I'll be glued to your ass till you're pregnant. Good morning. I don't allow surprise visits. Please make an appointment and I'll show you around. Dalia's with me. She's thinking of opening a kindergarten. Still don't know if you're good with kids? I had a developmental setback. Orna - our new assistant. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. I'm Dalia. Maybe you should take a short walk. I'm enjoying every second. I hope you're nobplaying with yourself... I don't need to touch myself, you're doing all the work for me. Dad! -Hi, sweetie. Finally here to pick up Noam from kindergarten? It's not him I'm interested in. I came for you. I'm doing it with Dalia. Are you expecting a miracle or are you hiding something? I'm doing it the primitive old way. Girls, can I offer you a threesome sandwich? Work on that belly, come back in a year. -Too bad, you're missing my coziest part. Zehava? Do you mind if I take him from you? Don't know, need to ask Kochi. Who's Kochi? -OTir matchmaker. Watch out! Do I need to ask Micha too? -Who's Micha? You're replacement. -Shaul? Yeah; hon? -Kochi asked that you don't leave before she brings you Noam's backpack. Hello? Hello? What's that noise? I'm making you a grandchild. Mom, are you alright? -I can fake orgasms too. Say hi to my mom. Hi, Ma'am... Is this for real? I never enjoyed myself as much as I do with your daughter. Bravo, bravo, bravo! Mom... take your medication. Baby's on the way! Is that Dalia's new assistant? -That's the situation. Don't answer me, you'll wake'him. I wasn't asleep. Aren'tyou tired of sleeping with her? You don't have to look so miserable. I have a good feeling this time. Mazal tov! Mazal tov! We're pregnant! We're pregnant! How are you? In pain. I'm pregnant! Come on... Anyone can say that. I got this 20 minutes ago. What is it? Can I keep it? I'll give you a copy. Your father bought this the day... you were born. He'd never tell me why he kept it but I think today he'd be very happy to open it. Avraham Levy... you'll have a grandchild. In Dad's memory! To health! Dr. Shohat summoned me for another check-up. "The metastasis disappeared completely. "There's no more evidence of the disease." Healthy as an ox! You got me pregnant after your knew you were healthy. What? I don't believe my illness was coincidental, it was all for him. See these earrings? My mother gave them to me the day I told her I'm pregnant. You resemble her so much. Each time I miss her, I come visit you. Dekel, no! Before a catastrophe happens, tell Gali to come get Dekel along with the other kids. Did you count to 10 before approaching me? I won't be responsible for any disaster that happens here. I'm not paying you to be idle. I'm not a warden. I'm not forcing you to be here. Zehava? Zehava? Hello. Who are you? I'm Agenda's present. Stay clear of Agenda, he's moving to the city dog pound. Thanks to him, I'm in love with the most charming man in the world. How many more men do you want to meet? Hello? I'm sorry. I'm on my way out. Bye. Welcome! I'm Rina, Micha's mother. -Nice to meet you. I'm Zehava. I know who you are. You're my son's angel. Our angel's here! Angel... I've been waiting for this kiss for a long time. I haven't seen him kiss like that since my pregnancy. Nice to meet you. I've been waiting for this moment for 15 years! Yaacov, Micha's father. -Nice to meet you. Zehava. Welcome! Hello. -Zehava... -Dalia. Hi How's your mother? -Thanks, she feels great. We can accept her as a regular grandmother. She doesn't know that the baby's up for adoption. A modest return for the treasure you're giving us. You did so much more for us. My favors are not up for sale. It's nothing compared to your grace. I did this for my mother. I'll find some other way to compensate you. We won't leave you empty handed. My mother defeated the disease. I'm happy for you both. This is the contract with your signature on it. You owe us nothing. Avraham, I haven't slept in two days out of joy. Hi, Dad. - "Avraham (Avi) Levy" - Le'chaim! Zehava's pregnant. I got pregnant so she'd treat her disease. Avraham, bless. Zehava that she'll love her child. Dad, now that she's well, 'Im free to give you grandchildren that are born out of love.' Shame on you! How dare you speak to your father? I'm a surrogate mother for Carmela's friends. You're punishing me for being alive and murdering my grandchild? I disgraced myself to save you. Basbusa.. I got you 3 tablets of Mifegyne. If that won't do away with the intruder, then you have a back-up of two pills of Cytotec. Micha. Micha, I know you can hear me. Micha, this can't wait. You're a big girl. It's out of my hands. I'm not here... It's about Zehava. I'm coming. Zehava's mother insists on meeting you. She's furious at you. Dekel? Dekel? Dekel? Zehava? Zehava! Where's Dekel? Peek-a-boo! -There's Dekel! Sorry I'm late. Thanks. Thanks for waiting for me. Gali, I have a foster family for him. How many kids do you have? -He deserves a responsible parent. How many kids do you have? -I'm realistic. How many kids do you have? If I had kids, I wouldn't wait up for you. If you had kids, I wouldn't have forgiven you. What's with her? I found a foster family for DekeL You're firec. This will cost you dearly. -I don't skimp when it concerns me. I'm pregnant. That's a good one! Do you have medical proof? Otherwise you'd fire me like you fired Aliza. -I expect total loyalty. You're a slave trader. -You're unemployed! See you in court. -You pain in the neck! Make some time, I'll probably be absent a lot. Bimbo! -Cheapo! We're getting there soon... I can't breathe. Are you OK? Are you OK? Oh, God! Relax, we're getting there. One more floor. Oh my God! Oh my God! -This is the lower level's. Dalia, my wife. Rachel, Zehava's mother. Nice to meet you. Congratulations on your recovery. She was sick like you were sick... I saw her test results, she had Cancer the size of a mammoth. Dr. Zee'vik, Rachel's friend. The mammoth was recruited to fertilize Zehava. So we never stood a chance to begin with. Unless he mans up and takes responsibility for his actions. I love her. -Are you giving up on me? I'm not getting married without you. Jews were never monogamous. Monogamy was invented by Christians. Why would Zehava want to marry a married couple? Why did you share your husband with her? She doesn't need us, she can have the baby on her own. Then why didn't she get pregnant so far? If not Micha, then who? This is our last chance for an offspring! Mizu? Batya? Batya? 3 Mifegyne. 2 Cytotec. What time is it? 19:42. Take it in 36 hours. Yes, "doctor". The two medications mimic a natural miscarriage. You owe me a grand. I don't accept credit. That's all I have. What are you hiding there under your towel? See for yourself. You said you take cash... Your cunt's worth much more. Mizu knew you're behind the door. She recognizes you when you park down the street. Why don't you let her in? Zehava'le, if something bad happens to me, I want you to do me a favor: I want you to take Mizu into your home. Why are you crying? I'm 86 already. Oh, we're back to square one. I'm having an abortion. What about your mother? She's not going anywhere soon. She got you off the hook with him! Who is it? We're here to visit my grandchild! Congratulations! That's OK... I'm a doctor. Hello? -Zehava, it's Micha. What do you want? -I have a surprise'for you. Not interested! Dr. Shohat will explain the hazards of artificial abortion. Sweetie.. One out of ten women becomes infertile. The chances you'll have a miscarriage in the future increases threefold. Who is it? Surprise! You're risking having a premature baby or stillbirth. You're the one who cooked this dish! He did it all for you! -I'll sue you! I'll compensate you for whatever you want. Good evening. Good evening. -Good evening. Give this to your wife! I'm Shlomo, Dalia's father. We came to ask for Zehava's hand in marriage. Oh, Shlomo... I see at least 3 karats here. Mrs. Levy, I see you are different from your daughter. You appreciate material incentives. No. Marry me. No. -Why not? Ask him how many women he wants. Dalia will be a wonderful mother! We'll be a glorious foursome! Does your wife know you want to marry Zehava? I love you as I love myself. Marry him. -You want my baby. I wouldn't marry my husband off to anyone. -I'm no adulteress. Your drive for perfection is killing my grandchild. Sweetie, give yourself a chance. Your baby needs you. Who is it? Congratulations! This is a one time thing, for old time's sake. Tired of swinging? -Hi, Dalia. Good evening. -Come on in, they'll take off soon. -I can call my sister instead. Have you decided to put your pride aside? I have someone for you with a real low self esteem. Shaul, you were the last blind date in my life. Girl, just sit on your ass and babysit other people's kids. Bye, sweetie. Tarzan, keep an eye on Jane. I'm coming. Zehava, do you want Agenda? I warned you that he'll end up in the city slaughterhouse. My boyfriend won't live with two dogs. In light of your popularity, I'd gladly adopt him but I promised I'd take care of Mizu. I thank you for making an effort to save my pregnancy, but I decline your offer. Love is like a car starter, let them push you so you get going. Even if you get a divorce, I won't marry you. He loves you more than me. -I won't have a baby for someone I don't love! -You're not having a baby for him, it's for yourself! -Why do I have to have a baby? Enough! Aren't you fed up with yourself?
