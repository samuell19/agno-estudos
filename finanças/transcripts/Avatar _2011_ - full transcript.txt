Hang in there! The ambulance is coming soon! It's going to be okay! Hang in there! The ambulance still isn't here? Please Michiko! Get someone's attention! Hurry up Michiko! Hey, is there anybody there? What are you doing? Hurry up! He's lost consciousness! Please save him! Are you Ayano-san? You're inconveniencing us by going out in a time like this! That's rude. Why is the ambulance coming at a time like this? I just washed this new car. Anyways! Please move your car! Okay! Well, I don't know much about laws, but you can't drive when drunk, right? Can you hold this? I'm glad I was able to get some snacks using my spare key. We pressed the intercom, but nobody answered! That's weird! My daughter should be there! Good morning. Morning. Sorry about yesterday! About what? It was your birthday, but I got home late! You're talking about that? There's not enough people and so I'm getting overtime. Here! What is it? Your Birthday present! It's a day late though. You wanted a phone right? - You don't look too happy... - No, that's not true! I mean it costs a lot of money... Don't worry about that! I'm working really hard! Don't spend too much time on the phone! Thanks! Thanks for the food. Taeko-san, you took another great picture, huh? You make everyone happy! You got that right! I admire your Avatar so much! Awano-san! Can you show us one more? Sure, take a look at them! This is the first time I've seen such an incredible outfit! It's not only beautiful, but super sexy! How nice! I want one too! I want this one! Taeko-san! How do you get such rare items? Yes! I want to know as well! I always say it! If you have a lot of Ava gold, then everyone can get it! Even if we have gold, we can't get any rare items! That's right! That's right! We aren't the chosen one, like Taeko-san! There's no helping it! I just got a new rare item! And I'll give someone an item I got yesterday! Abuko! Where's your morning greeting? Good morning, Awano-sama. You got a new phone, huh? It was a birthday present from my mother. You got this for your birthday? You got a text from your mother. On your way home, buy some curry from the super market. That's what she said! It must be tough, huh? Abuko! Taeko-san is showing you some sympathy, so you should say thanks, right? Thank you. So you don't get too carried away... Should we destroy your phone? No! Please don't do that! Hey, Saionji! The way you came in was too rude! Your eyes piss me off! Shall we do it for a minute today? One, two, three... It's painful, isn't it, Saionji? Make sure to get some good gulps of this fresh water! Do your best! Wow! So gross! She's spitting it all over the place! What are you doing? You're getting the classroom all wet! Saionji! You still have some water left. Make sure to do it until the end. Alright, let's start! Nabuko. Yes? Tell me your ID. My ID? I'll introduce you to the world of Avatars. Thank you. This one piece sure is cute. Hey... isn't that Nishiko Yamanouchi-kun? He's working part-time at Liberty ribbon! Oh crap! He's so cool! Yamanouchi-kun is quite the guy isn't he? I heard that he's coming over here! Are you for real!? Speaking of which... Yamanouchi-kun is pretty popular isn't he? It seems like his Avatar is really good! I wish that I could make an Avatar that would suit his Avatar! You're Abukumagawa-san right? Can you tell? We went to the same middle school, I'm Yamanouchi! Yes! Of course! That's a Takemi uniform right? You go to the same school as Awano. Yeah! Liberty Ribbon is nice isn't it? We just got that one piece. Cute, huh? I can't stand her! Dummy! Later! That place is the best isn't it? It's the snake woman huh? Be sure to join within 15 minutes of my invitation. You should thank me for getting you in! This is just a digital doll of me isn't it? Collaboration products now available! Huh? Liberty Ribbon? That's the design for the one piece that I wanted. It's 600 gold? I'll get 300 gold if get someone to join? Amazing... I didn't expect it to be this interesting. You should just give up. You're a foolish woman. Sorry for being late! You're going to be late like that, Nabuko? I'm very sorry. You couldn't sleep because you were playing Ava Q all night? What a lame Avatar! It stinks of poverty! Her Avatar doesn't have any fashion sense, just like her! Isn't that bad? So lame! Michiko! Dinner is ready! Michiko... Dinner is ready I said. I'll be there soon, just start without me. What? You're texting a friend? I'm not. Avatar. Avatar? Doesn't that cost money? It's okay! I just keep clicking on the banner ad and get gold bit by bit. That's fine but eat your food before it gets cold! Oh, that's right! Give me your phone Mom! - What's wrong? - Just let me see it. Geez. You're not registering for a weird site are you? It's okay! You might get an email from Ava Q but you can just ignore it. Alright! Thanks Mom! I don't really care, just hurry up and eat! Yeah... Michiko-chan! This apple is yummy! It's a freebie! Thanks as always! I can't do that! Please! I gave you a discount the other day! Alright, I understand. I'll prevent it from happening! Hey! Do you have a phone Obachan? Hey Michiko-chan! I won't let you make a fool out of me! Look! Mii-chan, what have people been doing on their phones recently? It'll be over soon. Hang on. Are you exchanging numbers, Michiko-chan? That's right! I'm so happy! Then send me some texts! This person can't send any texts and so I get none! Hey, send me some texts Michiko-chan! Alright! I finally got it! Look at this cute Liberty Ribbon one piece! What is that? I see, you guys won't understand even if I show you! Thanks for letting me use it! I'll send you a text Obachan! I'll see you soon Ojichan! - You're leaving already, Michiko-chan? - Yeah. I have gold waiting for me, so time to do plastic surgery! Huh? Plastic surgery? Plastic surgery...

Nice to meet you! I'm Yamanouchi a Liberty Ribbon fan! I wanted to be friends with a girl wearing that outfit! I sent you a message. Yamanouchi... By the way, I'm the guy from earlier! I work as a reader model for Meneg and I love fashion! And I've started working part-time at the Liberty Ribbon shop! No way! This is Yamaouchi-kun! You're talking to yourself again. Nice to meet you. I'm Michiko! Thanks for the message! I want to be friends with you! I tried the limited edition slot machine! I used 500 gold on it but... You went all out! Of course I did! There's 10 million Ava Q members, but only 50 people can get it! I want it so badly! It's such a rare item! I really want that rare item! - I mean it! - No kidding. Thanks! Yamanouchi-kun... This is Yamanouchi. Did you throw away your Liberty Ribbon one piece? It was so cute! That's too bad. I'm going to quit... This Avatar thig... Only 50 people will be able to win and get the ultra rare item! Did you just get the super rare item from the slot machine? Yeah! You got it? Yeah! No way! I mean, only 50 people can get it! Yeah, I'm glad I got it. Can you show me? Sure... What? What is it? Show me! Amazing, Nabuko! I wanted this one! Why aren't you wearing it? I should wear it? You should! It's a super rare item! Show me! Show me! Amazing! You got that? How? Oh crap! Oh crap! So beautiful! It's beautiful! I'm so jealous! Taeko-san! Nabuko got a super rare item from the slot machine! Nabuko did? Let us take a picture of it! So amazing! So beautiful. Morning Nabuko. Good morning Awano-sama. You probably don't know but... The Avatar Best dress contest is coming up. Best dress? It's the biggest Avatar event that's held once a year. Just like the theme states, the Avatar with the best outfit wins. The prize is a super rare 4-star item. The theme was just announced yesterday. The theme for this year is "Spring rain". I thought to myself "The Butterfly Oiran is perfect for this theme." Give it to me. I'm telling you to give it to me. That's... Nabuko! You know what'll happen if you don't give it to me, right? This is my precious treasure! So, please spare me this time! You foolish woman... Saionji-san... 'm sorry for startling you. I happened to see you being threatened by them. Awano has tortured many people. Actually I have it! The super rare item she wants. I got a lucky chance just like you. And got the item. If Awano and the others find out... Then I'll get bullied. She never did find out though. Then... That's why you're bullied? I understad. Don't want to let go of my items. I understand your feelings. Want me to open up your heart? You want more rare items! You'll get a ton of rare items... And become more and more popular! You've always been a person who didn't stand out. You want to stand out more. - Stop it! - That's exactly what you think. What do you know about me? You have the rare item that I need. I want to reform things! You're the only person who can get revenge on Awano and the others! You have the item that can turn things around! Get into the contest! I want you to win! You'll start a revolution. A revolution? You have the item that nobody in that school can get. You'll be able to be the ruler of the school. The ruler of the school? There's more rare items? More... more... There's a ton... It stinks of poverty! t doesn't have any fashion sense just like you! I'm telling you to give it to me! The rare items... I want you to win! You can start a revolution! You can be the ruler of the school! Amazing! Michiko! You're going somewlhere this late? Hey... Why are you spacing out? Did something happen? Nothing happened. Isn't that your Dad's watch? Why do you have that? Michiko! What are you planning on doing with that watch? Tell me what you're plannig on doing! I wanted money... Huh? I was thinking of selling that watch! What's the meaning of this? I'm giving you pocket money aren't I? 2000 yen isn't enough! I need a lot of money. In order to get the rare items, 10,000 or 20,000 yen isn't enough. Michiko... What are you saying? What do you mean rare item? Are you using your money on that Avatar game? It's not a game! When I get super rare items then everyone compliments me! People looking at me with such respect is unbelievable isn't it? I'm glad that I got such a lucky break! Things like this have never happened to me before! That's why I want to get more rare items to make my life better... You're going to sell your father's memento for something like that!? Wake up! There's more important things than that... Avatar is the most important thing to me! Avatar gives me confidence! Do you understand what you're saying? There's something wrong here! - I should've never given you that phone... - Shut up, let me go! I need to do this in order to get more rare items... I need to do it again. Getting super rare items will need a lot of Gold. In that case you need to get a lot of money immediately. There's a good way. Let's get going okay? Yeah, let's go! Let's go! How old are you? I'm 15. You're 15? You just graduated junior high? Is that right? 15 huh? Why does a 15 year old girl like you want money? Well, whatever! Shall we take a shower? This isn't what it looks like... I need to go... I need to go... Why are you stealing? I need rare items! I need web money. What about the usage fee? Please give me 40,000 yen! My name is Ikazaki. Nice to meet you. Please give me 40,000 yen. What about the usage fee? One million yen. Abuko! Congrats on getting the Best Dress! It's Abukumagawa-san, right? Can you be careful with your words? Do you know how important the Best Dress competition is? It's a once in a lifetime opportunity! I'm sorry Abukumagawa-san! Abukumagawa-san! Can you show me the Obou Tiara one more time? Of course, look at it as much as you want! Wow, it's so elegant! It's so beautiful! It's an honor that the winner is in the same class as me! And your Avatar showed up in the morning news articles online! Yes! Yes! I saw that! Wow amazing! You're so popular Abukukagawa-sa! Can I get a handshake? I want an autograph! Can I get one too? Me too! What are you guys doing? Get away from Abuko's phone! Huh? I don't understand what you're saying! We don't have any reason to talk about items with you! No matter how many items you get... There's no replacement for Abukukagawa-san's Best Dress award. What happened to my morning greeting? Do you know what will happen if you treat me this way? I always believed in you. Now it's your turn. Michiko-sama. Michiko-sama. Let's recruit special members today. We should gather some more members for our brand new Avatar circle. Michiko-sama! I brought a new applicant for today's membership! Nice to meet you Michiko-sama. I'm first year Rei Kyoko of class B! I admire you Michiko-sama! Michiko-sama! Please let me become a member! I understand. Get a gas mask from Saionji. Thank you! I will do my best to create the best Avatar in order for you to praise me! Listen up everyone! We need to gather a lot of members for Michiko-sama's sake! Then we can gather rare items for Michiko-sama. Behold! Michiko-sama's super Avatar! This is my new rare item! The Queen's dress with 4 stars! Michiko-sama! This is good Michiko-sama! In addition to the 13 members that we just recruited... We have 102 members! Is that right? Michiko-sama... are you worried about something? You don't look too enthusiastic. It's nothing. Yamanouchi-kun, are you doing okay? I haven't seen you in a while so I'm a little worried. You're not ill are you? I'm worried, so please send me a message if you can. This is Michiko. Sorry for all these texts. Are you receiving my messages? You're the one sending all these texts, right? Can you stop that? Listen, never send me a text again! Awano? Woah... for real? The winner for the contest was Miclmiko Abukukagawa? That's right! Everyone in our high sclhool knows her! She's a virgin? Then I've been texting that ugly-ass girl? I've been swindled! Even if she won the Best Dress, the real one is no good. Ugh, speak of the devil she just sent me a text. Don't screw with me ugly bitch! You should respond to her! It seems like she's always admired you. Dummy! I'm not responding to her anymore! You need to respond to her! I feel bad for Abuko! That ugly bitch doesn't know herself! Is this Saionji? Come see me immediately. You're no good Abuko! You deceived a pure boy like Yamanouchi-kun! Do it. Michiko-sama. Can do it as well? Just don't kill her. Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Die! Throw all of her rare items in the trash. Yes! Michiko-sama! Hey... My Avatar is everything to me... I'm begging you! But she won't get bullied too much looking like that. So I'll give you my item as a present. Just as I thought! It's perfect for you! That pig headgear! Listen up Awano. This is what happens when you go against me. If you do something like this again... It'll be much worse than this. Konoyabe! Kanbamiya. Awano! Is Awano here? She's absent again, huh? Niishi! Here! Iwamada! Here... Ueda! Here... Endou... Here... Okubo! Here! Okazaki! Here... Tadano! Here... Tatayama! Here! Karina! You want to look like this Anime girl? It's not Anime. It's an Avatar. I understand! It's fine if we just model it exactly like this face right? This requires consent from a parent. However, we can make certain arrangements to do it without their consent. That means this is a shady business right? This is the money we've collected from everyone. Everyone's looking forward to your resurrection, Michiko-sama. Thanks Saionji. Sounds good. I'll make you beautiful. Actually the winner was a super ugly girl who went to the same school I did! I totally got swindled! How funny! Such an ugly girl like her exists? She's hideous! She was bullied during junior high... When I heard that she was the winner... I was totally perplexed! Is that right? So this is a totally different topic, but... why did you break up with the other girl you were dating? She's been saying nonsense and was grossing me out. She's gone insane... Was that girl cuter than me? Not at all! Compared to you she looks like a sack of potatoes! Really? I just wanted to get rid of her because she started being too persistent. Anyways, you're the only one right now! Well said! You just met me yesterday! No, no, no! I'm serious! Wanna date me seriously? It's embarrasing to say it directly, but... Can I send you a text response? Man! I'm nervous! I'm a little scared though! Michiko? Ugh, she's so persistent! She sent me another text! Scum like you isn't suitable enough for me. What is this chick saying? She's so gross! She lost her mind too! I'm sorry that I could'nt live up to your expectations. That level was good enough for you, wasn't it? Michiko-sama. I filmed everything. Alright, send it to her. Understood. Was she cuter than me? Not at all! Compared to you she's like a sack of potatoes! I just wanted to get rid of her since she was so persistent. You're the only one right now! Michiko? Michiko? It's me. No way... Were you suprised? Do you realize what you're doing? Michiko! This is bad! Return to your normal self! Do you understand!? I wasn't worth anything before. That's why I don't need to go back. You're not Michiko! You're not Michiko! What's up with you guys? Good morning, Mizokuchi sensei. Michiko-sama! We just received a message from Ava Q! There is a special event to commemorate the 5th anniversary. The winning possibility is 1/1,000,000. The prize is a super rare 5 star item! If you get a 5-star item then we might get hundreds of new members. No, we might get thousands. I want it! If I get this then I'll become a Goddess! It's okay! I'm sure you'll get it with everyone's help. 2nd year Abukukagawa Michiko, please come to the office. What do you need? You became very pretty didn't you? If you don't need anything then I'll be going back. Sit down. You guys just do what you want huh? What do you mean You were a Avatar circle right? You snuck into the school in the middle of the night... And did something strange right? Listen up Awano. This is what happens when you go against me. The next time you do something like this... You won't be so lucky next time. She recorded your guy's voices when you were violent against her. Then she gave me the evidence. It seems like Awano's father launched an investigation into it. It seems like she's involved in a crinimal case now. That's going to be troublesome for us! Shall I erase this data? I have a "Give and take" relationship with my students. You sure are a dummy. Take it off. I'll treat you good. Die you germ! Your Mom sure is unfortunate! You're going to go bye bye if this gets out! You're poorer than shit yet you get all this expensive stuff... and her daughter is going to get into big trouble! Your family is cursed isn't it? And it's not just you. Everyone in your circle is going to get punished as well. Listen up everyone! It's time to let all the fools know our true power. In 3 days on day X... We can use everyone's power to get rid of all the insects that disturb us! Michiko-sama. Instead of 3 days, how about we do it tomorrow? No, that day is a special day. Everything is going to be set in motion on that day. I'm home. I'm home Mom. It's been 3 years since Dad passed away huh? You still haven't forgotten your frustration from that day have you? Watch me. Come inside my house. I've become afraid of what Michiko-san and Saionji-san are doing. I can't follow them anymore. But I'm scared just thinking about what punishment I'll get for leaving... Is that right? You've mustered a lot of courage to come here and tell me, huh? It's okay. I'll protect you from that crazy group. Thank you sensei. But there's other issues surrounding this though. You joined that circle out of your free will right? If that's the case then there's no reason for me to protect you. But can make an exception. So... You know what you have to do right? Since you've come this far, you understand what that is right? Yes. I want to be on equal footing with my students. Let's have a nice give/take relationship. Sensei! Hold on one second! What is it? If possible, I want to make my body nice and clean. Good work. Thank you. Saionji... you... Saionji-san! I found the device with the recording on it! Also... found all of this! I found something amazing! Mizokuchi has stopped moving. Hey Mizokuchi! You wanted me to drank it all. Did you think I would forgive you? I won't forgive you until every drop of water is in your body! I'm alone. Nobody else is coming tonight so don't worry. The other humans are in the process of disposing all the insects. You're still going to speak in that condensing way? You heard from Mizokuchi didn't you? All of you are going to be punished! You're talking about that? I didn't expect you to withdraw silently. But you even sold your body to him? You've really worked hard. How pitiful! It seems like all of the things you've done with Mizokuchi have been recorded. But don't worry. That insect was properly exterminated. So that means that the punishment was delivered on Mizokuchi and not us. My Father is connected with some higher ups in the police! He gets along with the police, huh? Today, 7 years ago... my father died because of your stupid father! You guys killed my dear father! Help was right in front of us but a car was in their way! Do you understand? I don't want to understand your feelings Abuko! Is that so? Then I'll have to make you understand. It seems like something happened. I told you right? The other humans are getting rid of all the insects. The path to the victim is blocked! We can't find the owner! We need to get inside of the car and drive it away! They have to be somewhere over there! Dad! Dad! The ambulance is coming soon! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Abuko! You little! Abuko! Move! Move! Now do you understand? My feelings. Matsumoto. Your work with Mizokuchi the other day was good. Your devoted work is wonderful. I recognize your accomplishments and will award you a gas mask for it. Thank you Michiko-sama! I'll treasure it forever! Matsumoto! I'm going to expand my circle more and more! Eventually, national unification will be achieved. You will be one of my right-hands next to Saionji. So expect great things. I'm prepared to do anything for you Michiko-sama! Why? Why wasn't I selected!? Avatar Mania? She has the Goddess gear. The Goddess harp and the Goddess drape robe? Nice to meet you Michiko-san. I'm sorry for sending you a message so suddenly. How is the 5 star rare item? I miraculously won the first prize in the lottery. Why is she sending me a message like this!? But I don't think the 5 star rare item is for someone like me. But rather more suitable for the Best Dress Michiko-san. If you grant my request then 'll give you the 5 star item. For every request you grant, I'll give you one item. Michiko-sama! I'm sorry for calling you out here at this time. It's fine. Did something happen? I want to give you a really brief report. Is it a bad report? The time has finally come. The time for me to become a Goddess. Goddess? Did you get the rare 5-star item?! Congratulations Michiko-sama! This will cause the people in our circle to expand an insane am ount! Thanks. I've gotten this far because of you. That's why I wanted to tell you this sooner. Let's make a stronger circle together. Saionji-san. Thank you. Thanks! Abukukagawa-san. I don't need this anymore. So you can have it. Me? Now then... It's yours. Saionji-san! Good work all the way up until now! I'll get the third item this way! Thanks to you, I'll become a Goddess! Thanks... Thanks Saionji-san! Why!? I'll become a more beautiful Goddess! I feel so good when I expand my circle! You're happy too aren't you? Don't screw with me! Abuko... It's over... Now'll get everything! A Goddess! I've finally become a Goddess! Thank you for doing everything that asked. I was supervising this event the whole time. In order to get a rare Avatar item, you killed your precious comrade. How does murdering people make you a Goddess? Stupid bitch! You still didn't figure out it was me? You should have realized it was me when ordered you to kill Saionji! Stuupid! I didn't expect to win the lottery after you pushed me into the abyss! God was telling me to take revenge! But I didn't think it would go this well. I told the idiots Katayama and Kariya that I'd give away my 5 star items. I hit them from behind and messed their faces up! I told you to dispose their corpses! It's underneath the tallest tree in the back of the park. Inside the bush, there is a corpse underneath tlme blue sheet. There lies my first request. I want you to dispose that corpse. I'll leave the method to you. I don't care how you do it. Please get rid of the evidence afterwards. Once you grant my request then I'll give you the Goddess paradise. The second corpse is in the black bag by the riverbed. Please make sure that no evidence is left behind. You'll get the second item if you grant this request of course. I wanted to kill Saionji with my own hands... but then I figured that the ultimate revenge would be if you did it directly. You killed someone who believed in you! Then you figured out that it was my order. I wonder what kind of face she's making in hell? Abuko! You're frustrated aren't you? You were deceived by me! And you even killed Saionji with your own two hands! Tell me how you feel! Who cares about that. I don't give a shit about that! Just hurry up and give me the Goddess Drape robe like you promised. The Avatar game has made you insane! But it doesn't matter anymore. I'll make you forget everything! Goddess Drape robe. It's so beautiful. I've finally become the most beautiful Goddess! We'll keep expanding our circle... And become the rulers of Japan in the near future! Gather more and more members! Give a Banzai for the Goddess! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! Eat something yummy with this Mom. There's no way I can receive such a large sum of money from a stranger. Matsumoto! What's all this ruckus about? It's Matsumoto-sama, right? Can you watch how you speak? What is this? Did you hear that? She doesn't know about Lucky Duck! A new game was announced on Saturday on their social media! The items in Lucky Duck are so rare they make the items in Ava Q look like trash! Matsumoto-sama got such a rare item that surpasses the Goddess one! I'm thinking of creating a new circle! Shall I let you in A-bu-ko? Don't screw with me Matsumoto! You traitorous whore! Your friend Matsumoto is inviting you to Lucky Duck! Click this link to register! I'll make you fashionable very soon. Wait for me okay? Michiko.
