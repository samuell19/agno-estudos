[HELICOPTER WHIRRING] [INAUDIBLE] It is with great pride and respect, the United States government has volunteered to return the Byzantine Fire, a legend for over a thousand years, to its rightful owner, the Republic of Turkey. [APPLAUSE] In accordance with the wishes of the Turkish government, no one has laid eyes on the ruby as it seems that the stone carries a superstition. Not a superstition! A curse! A curse of death to anyone who lays eyes upon the ring! [CAMERAS CLICKING] A curse, then. No one has set eyes on the ruby itself, except for a museum worker. Now dead! WOMAN: Yes, now dead, who originally discovered the ruby among a collection willed to the county museum by an anonymous donor. And this will mark a new period of international cooperation -for the protection of rare and valuable... Ah. -[DOOR OPENS] [PEOPLE EXCLAIMING] [PEOPLE SHOUTING] [SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] Long live the Armenian Liberation Party! [TIRES SCREECHING] [METAL CLICKING] GUS: [ON HEADSET] Bruno, I'm in! Ah. [STAMMERS] All here, all here. Gus, all here! All clear! All clear! [CLOCK TICKING] [WHISPERS] Bruno! Bruno! It's a Hasslemort! So that's how that's pronounced. Ah! Everything's looking good. [INDISTINCT TALKING] [INDISTINCT] [DOOR OPENING] [UNZIPS] [URINATING] BRUNO: [ON HEADSET] Oh, man, that feels good. -What? -The stone. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] Long live the Armenian Liberation Party! [TIRES SCREECHING] Hold it right there! Goddammit! Which one of you foreign clowns is Mansourian? Gus! Gus! Gus, someone's here! You got to get the hell out of there! I am Mansourian. I'm Freedly. -And I'm Zachary. CIA. -CIA. So, tell us about the ruby. Now, listen here, we don't know anything about it. [LOCK OPENS] Open the store, Mansourian. Gus! Get out of there! We're taking it up the ass! -How did you know it was me? -BOTH: We are the CIA. I've been robbed! [CAR APPROACHING] -GUS: Let's go! -[ENGINE REVS] [TIRES SCREECHING] Whoa! Bruno! Shh! I'm not a man who's afraid to express his emotions! -We're rich! -Shh! Bruno! -Okay. Shh... -Yes. You were fantabulous. A regular Butch and Sundance. Ooh. Ooh, ooh, ooh. Take a look at this. A bank. A big bank. Arco Towers in Long Beach. Piece of cake. -Huh? -Not interested. What do you mean you're not interested? This place is talking to us! "Gus, Bruno, take me! Squeeze every last drop out of me! "Then turn me upside down and shake me "'til my last penny drops out at your feet!" -[WHISPERS] Bruno! -What? -You're going to wake up June! -Okay, okay, okay. JUNE: No, he won't. Holy shit! I was supposed to be at that job interview an hour ago. I'll see you later. Dad, a job interview at 2:00 a.m.? -Ooh, nice! -GUS: Thanks. Hmm! We cracked a Hasslemort 2000 to get it. Congratulations. I'm so proud of you. GUS: Thank you. Gee, you told me you stopped. -We did, but... -We were pressured into this... By circumstances. Overwhelming economic opportunity versus the diminished potential in a depressed job market. I'm having great difficulty believing this. -GUS: Which part? -Oh, every part. Could you guys try honest work more often? -Once even? -[SCOFFS] Well, at my old job at the zoo, they used to test food on me to see if it was safe for Cocoa the gorilla. I could put in a good word for you. See? Thanks. I'll think about it. Well, I'm out of here! Bye, honey. See you tomorrow when we fence the stuff. [DOOR CLOSES] You're mad at me? Ah, no, I'm not mad. I'm disappointed. Yeah, I am mad. Fed up. [GUS COUGHING] [CONTINUES COUGHING] I'm fine. Don't worry about me. I want to marry you. [BREATHES DEEPLY] I want to marry you too. Someday. When? When you quit. You were supposed to be looking for a real job. I am looking. Just haven't found anything. So you decided to rob a jewelry store? Yeah, it was kind of a nice gesture on my part. What? I did it for us! For us? Yeah! I wanted to make sure that we'd be comfortable from the beginning. We're comfortable now. Ugh. What is this? Costume. Reproduction. Fake jewel. [GASPS] You promise that there won't be any more nice gestures? I promise. And you'll stop listening to my father? [SNICKERS] I will. When? Now! [AUDIENCE CLAMORING] MAN: Gentlemen, please, we would like to continue! If the CIA would cooperate in stopping vehicles with diplomatic plates! The suggestion that diplomats with the United Nations are responsible is ridiculous! What agency was responsible for the transfer of the Byzantine Fire? That's classified information. [ALL CLAMORING] Now, we know that because because the Byzantine Fire has been missing for over 200 years, that there are no photographs available of it, but, we have located a rendering of the gem in question in this 18th-century painting. [ALL EXCLAIM] [INDISTINCT SHOUTS] Don't prick me, Leon. -Ouch! Goddammit! -[PIN CLATTERS] But, sir, don't you want everyone to know you are? -Still on for lunch, Francis? -Bet your ass, Ray. Half the county already knows, Leon. Look, this is no ordinary press conference. These are diplomats in there. Okay. Here's a little speech I worked up for you. Shit, Leon! You're absolutely right, sir. -MAN 1: Armenian plunderer! -MAN 2: Turkish murderer! Gentlemen, please! -Call up the cops! -Yeah, you're a thief! -This meeting is not... -I don't think we should rule out the Soviets! -[CLAMORING] -[GUNSHOT] FRANCIS: Quiet, goddammit. Now, watch your language, sir. This is going to be in the 6:00 news! I don't give a fuck if they put it on the side of milk cartons! My name is Chief Inspector Francis Mahoney, LAPD, and this thing happened on my turf. Now, you two dickheads can blame the Ruskies if you want to. -And the rest of you... -[CAMERAS CLICKING] Aliens, can blame each other! But I did not get to be top cop in this great city without recognizing a burglary when I see one. And this was a burglary. This was definitely done by a safe-cracker and a damned good one, but you can bet your sweet sister's ass I'm gonna find him if I have to haul in every goddamned criminal in this city. And now, if you will excuse me, I have jails to fill. The jails are full. Then I will fill the hallways. -What is your name? -Sir? Asshole! JUNE: Honey, can we take Dad shopping tonight? GUS: Whatever you say. JUNE: We gotta get him out of all that polyester. He's a potential fire hazard. Here, drink up. I got to go. I'm late. [DOOR CLOSES] I'm Gatou Vardebedian of the new Armenian Liberation Party and I want the stone! What stone? Don't play dumb with me, infidel, or you will give me no choice. She's very beautiful. She is my cousin, Erika, and her blood will be on your hands. -What? -I am holding her hostage and I will kill her in one hour if you do not give me the stone. Are you sure you got this hostage deal straight? I will kill a member of my family, every six hours until you give it to me. How's that for straight? I can tell you're a real pro. Where is it? Oh... It's in the glove compartment. [STARTS ENGINE] [SCREAMS] Quitting? What do you mean, quitting? What do you think, Bruno? I am quitting. [SIREN WAILS] -Hold it right there! -All right, hold it, hold it! [SIGHS] Bruno. What are you doing? Come on. But why? There are vaults out there just begging to be cracked, and you're in your prime earning years. Why throw all that away? I don't want to lose June. I wanna get married. I wanna settle down. I'm quitting! That's not what you wanna do, that's what June wants you to do. And what about me? We're a team. If you quit, what am I gonna do? [CHUCKLES] First, we're going to change your boots, then you'll be my best man. Come on, Bruno, cheer up! [BUZZING] -RALPH: What's the password? -Carlo. That was last years'. [SIGHS] Okay, Ralph, what's the new one? -Circus. -God! Okay. Circus. [DOOR OPENS] Next time, I'll pick the lock. [KNOCKING] Hey, come on in. -My maid died, all right? -She must have died in here. [LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY] Ready for business? You know, that's all people ever say to me. Do they say to me, "Hi, Ralph"? You know, "How you doing, Ralph"? Hi, Ralph. How you doing? You don't mean it. You know, I see people in a bar, I buy them a drink, I talk about their problems, I talk about their job, I even get in, you know, involved in their personalities and next day I see, you know, they go to a different bar. The only people, you know... The reason people come see me is 'cause I give top dollar. Just 'cause they don't want to sit and talk to me. You know, this guy gives lousy dollar, they go see this guy Stoon! Let's go to Stoon's! -Oh, go to Stoon's. -Bruno. Bruno. Beautiful! Beautiful! Wait just a second. [CHUCKLES] Beautiful! So? You boys got a fortune here. You don't have to take this to Stoon. -[BANGING ON DOOR] -MAN: Open up, Ralph! Police! [HIGH PITCHED VOICE] Just a minute, please. [SNIFFING] Jesus, Ralph, somebody die in here? Oh, I don't think that's any of your business. COP 1: Wrong again, Ralph. See, everything you do is my business. RALPH: Oh, I don't think so. COP 1: Wait a minute! -What's this? -RALPH: What's it look like? You guys happen to have a search warrant? You happen to have any stolen goods? That's cut glass costume jewelry, so forget it. [CHUCKLES] You know what I like about you, Ralph? -What? -Nothing! Let's go. Listen, I got to get my overcoat. I'll catch a cold in a lockup. [SCOFFS] Sorry. [WHISPERS] I'm sorry. We just lost half a million in diamonds! I can't believe it! We can always ask the cops to give it back. That is the stupidest idea I've ever heard. Don't worry, there's got to be plenty more where they came from. Hey, mister, could you help me? I need to get home. -Buzz off! -What's the problem? I forgot the combination. -Don't bother, I've tried. -Sure. -Mr. Boy Scout. -Give me a break, Bruno. 14, 24, 36. Don't forget. Thanks, mister. -Sweet kid. -Yeah, I like little girls. You know, something big must be going down. Hey, where's my bike? Cops haven't been in this position since 1969. Someone took my bike! Mister... Hey, hey, hey, hey! -Come on, guys! -[SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY] Hey, hey! TINY: So then, I washed off the ax and I put it back with the girls... [MEN LAUGHING] Hey, well, Gus and Bruno. I was just telling the boys here what happened to Pete Orbin. Something happened to Pete Orbin? Yeah, we had this little thing. See, he shortchanged me. Said he made a mistake. Said he was counting on his fingers. So, what happened? Well, I cut off some of them fingers. He won't count on 'em no more. [LAUGHS] Personally, I use a calculator. Yeah, I think that's wise. All right, let's get down to business. The cops grabbed me this morning, jacked me around for two hours. Yeah, they've been leaning pretty heavy. The cops are very impolite. It's because of this ruby. Nobody can do nothing. I can't stick my fuckin' head out of my fuckin' window. All because the cops can't find some shiny rock! Hell! What rock? Byzantine Fire. You think the law would have found that dammed stone by now. Oh, the law! You wanna count on the law? That's right. Where are they when you need 'em? Yeah, my business is in the crapper all 'cause the cops can't find this ruby. Yeah, and what did we do? I don't know what we did, but we gotta do something. The cops grabbed our loot. We ought to do it! -Do what? -Find the ruby. And then what? Give it to the cops? -Look. A guy in town took the stone, right? -Yeah. So I know some guys that you guys know different guys, and they know guys. By the time you're done, everybody knows everybody. -Who are all these goddamned guys? -Us! -Here, it's coming in now, boss. -TINY: There. WOMAN: [ON TV] The Byzantine Fire, missing for centuries, remains missing. An intense police crackdown on known criminal elements has so far netted nothing. The stolen Byzantine Fire, which carries an alleged ancient curse, was taken last night at City Hall. [GROANING] Gus, you are a genius, man! I'm gonna give you this fucker's head on a plate. Eat him for lunch. Hey, I don't think we should, like, rush into anything. What? Why the hell not? I mean, we got the man power, we got the access, we got the interest. Hey, hey, hey, Benjy. Benjy, Benjy. Get to the cops. Bud, you're a stoolie, hey! Work for us for a change! [STAMMERS] Come on, Tiny. Well, pretend you a stoolie, then. -Pretend I'm a stoolie? -Yeah. I like that. All right, everybody out of here. All of you. And I want everybody back here at five... I've got the stone! -You've got the stone? -Yeah. Gus, this is it! Come on, Bruno. Stop harping, okay? We're in trouble. Are you kidding? We're in the black, 10-nothing! This is it, Gus, the big cash-in! I always knew we had it in us. Oh... I'm gonna need a couple of these for these for my scrapbook. -Bruno. Bruno! -What? What do we do now? What do we do now? We proceed directly to "go." That's what the hell we do now. Where the stone? At the apartment. -Hey, Bruno! -What? Bruno! [TIRES SCREECHING] Hey, Gus... The stone! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] June? I'm sorry, but the computer was down and, uh... You're sorry. You know, I'm sick and tired of hearing "I'm sorry." You know, ever since you people went to the new computer, all I ever hear around here is "I'm sorry." I'm sorry for this, excuse me... Miss... I'm sorry! No. MAN: Thank you for visiting with us, MonsieurCardinale. Thank you for inviting me. I am with the Turkish delegation to the United Nations. My name is Bakran Osbarez Burjaran. Nice to meet you, Bob. I advise you not to trifle with us, MonsieurCardinale. We have placed listening devices in the hideaways of this city's most nefarious criminals, including that of MonsieurTiny. TINY: [ON TAPE] ...sharp, and somebody better know where that stone is! [STOPS TAPE] Now, we know that you're after our Byzantine Fire. Who do you think has it? Um, Elvis? We checked. He has an alibi. [CHUCKLES] Sorry. I'll do my best to find it. 800 years ago, the stone was stolen from Constantinople! The guiding spirits of all of Byzantium disappeared with it and the empire crumbled into ash! To guarantee the rebirth of the Great Byzantine Empire, the stone, the ruby, must be returned! So your best will not be enough, you must do better, MonsieurCardinale! So you will find it and you will give it to me. Or else... Better than my best is no problem. I warn you. Do not make me do something that I would not do, unless someone make me do it because they didn't do something someone told them to do. Don't worry, Bob. I would never do something to make someone do something to someone because that someone didn't do something that someone wanted them to do. I'm glad we understand each other. Me too. We will be in touch. You may go now. [DOOR OPENS] [CLATTERING] -[GASPS] -Oh, Geez! What are you doing home from work? What did you do to my living room? Same thing you did to your bedroom. BOTH: Did you find it? -This what you're looking for? -Holy moly! Oh, I guess it's not a cheap reproduction, huh? Guess not. Excuse me. I wonder what we're gonna get for it. Oh, we'll get about 20 years, killed, hunted down like deer. Come on! [BANGING ON DOOR] MAN: Police! Open up! Police! -What do we do now? -COP: I said police! Hide the ring. Hide it. Hide the ring! -Hide the ring! -I can't! COP: Want me to break it down? All right... -Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! -Shh! COP: Breaking down the door! What are you doing? You're pulling my knuckle out! So what did you do, weld it on? -Come on, shit! -COP: Can you hear me out here? I said police! Now, open the door! -[POUNDING ON DOOR] -COP: Okay, we're coming in. -That's not going to work. -GUS: It'll have to! -Holy moly! -COP: two, three, four! Open the door! Come on, let's go! -[PIANO PLAYING] -[JUNE SCATTING] -Rene Agustin Cardinale? -Yeah. We need you to come downtown with us. -May I ask why? -No. You may not. Okay. -Darling? -Honey? What about a goodbye kiss? Puppy. Oh. Honey. GUS: Pull on it, pull it. Pull on it. -GUS: [GROANS] Wait, wait. -[JUNE MOANS] [BOTH MOANING] [CONTINUES MOANING] It's all right. They're engaged. -Come on, do it. Do it. -[JUNE MOANS] GUS: Wait, wait, wait. -[THUD] -[BOTH PANTING] [EXHALES SHARPLY] [CONTINUES MOANING] What, do you want a cigarette now? You can pick him up in a couple of hours. You can finish up later, okay? Let's go. [DOOR CLOSES] -[CRASHES] -[CAT MEOWS] FREEDLY: Rene Agustin Cardinale? Rumor has it you're one of the best safe crackers in Europe. I know, I started the rumor. -Don't get smart with me. -Let's get stupid. Rene... Agustin... Those are girl's names, aren't they? Well, not in Switzerland. What do they call you in America? Rene? [ALL LAUGHING] Gus. Okay, Gus. You know why you were brought here? Because the Byzantine Fire was stolen. Oh, really? You know, huh? Well, then maybe you can tell us why the Turks want it back, huh? To guarantee the return of the Great Byzantine Empire. He knows. Well, now, is there anything you don't know? Such as, the stone was stolen by Armenians? And then, somebody stole it from them? And it's your job to get it back. I know that. Print him. Give me your hand. No, the other hand. Left hand. Thumb. Just relax it. Let me do it. Whoa! Put that finger away. When you're in Los Angeles, the LAPD decides when to fingerprint. -Hi. -Hi. -What is your name? -Gus. -Gus, what? -Gus Cardinale. Cardinal, like the blue bird. Where's that accent from, Gus, New Jersey? Yeah. Switzerland. -You married? -No. Then why the ring? I used to be married. I stopped. Don't dick with me, Gus. Last guy dicked with me is painting the landscapes with his teeth. What color is a ruby, Gus? -Ruby! What color is it? -[MOUTHING] Red. Red. What does the word "Hasselmort" mean to you? -"Hassel..." -One word. "Hasselmort." A deli? A deli. Safe cracker? Get out of here, Gus. Now. We need you we'll give you a call. [SIGHS] That, gentlemen, is how you conduct an interrogation. What's the matter? Get you face caught in a zipper? What'd he mean by that? See that van? Sure. [EXPLOSION] That is my brother and his family. They thought they were going to Disneyland. I hope you're satisfied. What? You blew up your bother and his family? They were honored to die for the cause. [CAR HONKS] My grandmother loved her life. Give me the stone. -[CAR HONKS] -JUNE: Gus. Who, may I ask was that? I have a strong feeling you won't believe me. Let's go. -Try me. -Well, a... -GUS: A homicidal Armenian terrorist. -JUNE: Please. She knows about the ring. -You still have it. -Of course I still have it. -I can't take it off. -They didn't... They didn't see it? June, they saw it and they said, "Please, Mr. Cardinale, go home." What do you think? Okay you don't have to get snappy. -I'm not snappy. -What are we gonna do? Let's go home. Let's just go home. -All right. -Okay? So... Benji Klopzik. Good afternoon, chief inspector. Fry in hell, Klopzik. My pleasure, sir. So... All you social misfits, penny-ante hustlers, cheap jack four flushers, misunderstood children of malnourished mothers, have decided to help the LAPD find the Byzantine Fire. -Is that it? -Yes, sir. All of us misfits are very excited about it. Listen to me, haircut. There is no deal here. Whatever you and your friends decide to do will be done strictly out of public spiritedness. -You got that? -Yes, sir, chief inspector. Good. Now get out of here. Yes, sir, chief inspector. Now. -Come on, Benji. -Put a wire on him. A wire, sir? You got a problem with that, Klopzik? No, sir. A small wire will be my pleasure, sir. Fry in hell, you stoolie scum. KLOPZIK: My pleasure, sir! It's good as new. So what happens now? -We got to go to Tiny's. -Tiny's? Now? Why? -Why? -Why? Because I don't wanna have my legs broken. -What? -Legs. Hey, hey, hey! You can't keep that in the house. -Why not? -Because it's dangerous. -Get it out! -June, June, it's not dangerous. -Take it with you. -I can't. Why not? -Because... -It's dangerous, precisely. Exactly. So, be careful. So my source, this west side guy, tells me diplomats have the ruby at the Russian embassy. -[CROWD DISAGREES] -Oh, bologna! Sit your fat butt down! You watch too much TV. Shut up! Ah-ha! Gus and Bruno, just in time. Well, this is your bright idea, to look for the guy with the ruby. -Sure. -I hope you got some news for us. -I can trust you guys? -[CROWD AGREES] -Like family? -Yeah! Like cousins. Okay. I can guarantee the... The ruby ring. How come you can't say it, Gus? I know, I know, I know that voice. GUS: Oh, I can say it. -TINY: Is that so? -[REPEATING] I know, I know, I know... I know that voice. I know that voice. Come here. [YELLS] Come here! I've known you guys for a while, right? -Sure. -Well, Gus... [SNIFFS] There is a stink [SNIFFS AGAIN] coming from you, like something I never smelt before. Oh, that's me. I just had Thai food. No, I don't think so! -I think it's you guys! -[CROWD AGREES] [ON WIRE] Breaker, Breaker Roller Skate, this is Widow Maker. Do you copy? -Breaker Breaker, Roller Skate... -Will you shut up? -A wire? A wire in my room? Who? -Shit! -Who? -Roller Skate, come in. Who, who? Benjy, you're dead! TINY: Get him! [MOB YELLING] -Bruno! -What? -Come on, come on! Come on! -[HONKING] [TIRES SCREECH] [GUNFIRE] [POLICES SIREN WAILS] GUS: Bruno! Wait, my friend, wait, I only want to speak with you! [EXCLAIMING] Mr. Officer, hello. Sorry, bad brakes. [RECORDING BEING PLAYED] A wire, a wire in my room? Who, who? Benjy, you're dead! OFFICER: Come on, Benjy. Come on! Look, look, nobody's going to hurt you in here, all right? -[RECORDING] Benjy... -[GASPS] You're dead! Come on, Benjy, come on! Look... See, there's nobody in here but the nice chief inspector! -Chief, they're going to kill me! -No, they're not, Benjy! Chief, I promised him departmental protection. -He promised me. -He did? Chief, if we don't help him, every informant in town is going to know that we didn't help him and for the next six months we won't know jack shit from a jujube. And he did get us our man! -And you owe me. -I do? Yeah. But I don't want any of those programs, none of them witness protection things. They won't do me no good. What do you want, Klopzik? Sit down, Chief. Sit down. Well... Plastic surgery for starters, and a new name. A whole new identity. And a nice apartment. A nice soft job, decent money, but not too much work. And hey, maybe in the Mayor's office. Mayor's office? Yeah. And I don't want to be a Klopzik no more. Well, what do you want to be, Klopzik? -I want to be a... Smith. -Benjy Smith. No! Brenda Smith. Brenda... Smith. [SNORTS] Ho! Whoa, whoa, I would love to help you become Brenda Smith. I'll take care of it, Chief. I'll take care of it. Fucking Brenda Smith! Brenda fucking Smith! [SIGHS] WOMAN 1: All right, I'll see you next week, bye, bye. WOMAN 2: Bye, take care of yourself. [COIN CLATTERS] [PANTING] [PHONE RINGS] DISPATCHER: LAPD. Hello? I want to speak to Mahoney. -[DOOR OPENS] -LEON: Chief! There's somebody on the phone, I think you really ought to talk to. -Who? -Guess. Who? What color is a ruby? Hello? -Mahoney? -Yes, Cardinale, it is. -GUS: I'm not Cardinale. -Oh, really? I got the ruby, I want to make a deal. A deal? Let me tell you something... MAHONEY: Not only would I not disgrace myself doing deals with the likes of you, when I get hold of you I'm going to ram your head so far up your ass, you'll be staring at your buns! You got that? Hello? [TIRES SQUEALING] Hello? So sorry. Bad brakes. Call AAA. Oh, I apologize. Wait! Wait! I just want to talk to you! One minute! One second. He hung up on me. Maybe that was the wrong approach. Hi! -How many in your party, sir? -None! -Hi, how many people... -[GROWLS] [PLATES SHATTERING] Excuse me. WAITRESS: Hey! -[EXCLAIMING] -[MAN GRUNTING] Maybe you shouldn't have yelled at him, you scared him off. Who the fuck asked you, Leon? Yeah, Leon? And we got to get him! Us! Not the CIA! Not those foreign creeps! I couldn't agree with you more, sir. And not the goddamned criminal element either. Although you can bet your granny's knockers they got the best shot at it. Absolutely, sir. I think we lost him. We can sit here 'til the next administration and I bet that... [PHONE RINGING] TECHNICIAN: That's the line. Cardinale? MAHONEY: Cardinale? [GIGGLING] I'm not Cardinale. Yeah. And I'm not Mahoney either. -So, talk to me, stranger. -Listen. I've got the ruby, I don't want it, you do. Let's make a deal. -The ruby for what? -A different thief. -Greater LA. -Another thief? TECHNICIAN: Sherman Oaks, I think. Yeah, you find a guy, you announce you got him, and the ruby ring and it's over. He's in Long Beach or Malibu. God, would you make up your goddamn mind! Some place with sand. Where is this thief? I mean if he doesn't exist I don't have somebody for the press conference... ...and if he does, the frame doesn't stick! Hey, listen, what do I know? I'm not a cop! He's in Hollywood! [CHUCKLES] -Well, blow me dry! -What? Brenda Smith. Who? I don't think that's any of your business. I've got the perfect guy. So, what about the ring? After you make the announcement. MAHONEY: What announcement? On the 11:00 p.m. news, you just say you've caught the thief with the ruby ring. You've got yourself a deal. All right, I think he's in Pasadena or... Ah, forget it! I don't know where this guy is! I want my diamonds back. -What diamonds? -The ones your men took from my fence, Ralph Jackson. I'll check into it. Now, how do I get the ring? GUS: I'll get back to you later. First, you make the announcement. Thanks a lot. Nice work. TECHNICIAN: [MOUTHING] What? Shit! [GASPS] Gus, what happened? The Turks have been here. Going somewhere? Yeah, I solved everything. We're leaving the country. I made a deal with the police to trade the ring for the diamonds. That'll solve our problems. Fine, then we're outta here. The ring is gone. JUNE: I know, I took it. Thank God! See, I told you keeping it here was dangerous and if I hadn't moved it the Turks would have found it. Now, okay, okay, okay. Where'd you put it? In my safety deposit box. Good thinking. All we got to do is go and get it. Let's go! Hang on, hang on, wait! The bank is closed. [SCOFFS] Don't you have keys? Yeah, well, I mean, it's a bank. They don't just give keys to everybody who works there. Okay, well, we'll get it in the morning. Oh, but tomorrow's Saturday, the bank is closed. Banks are open on Saturdays! Not this one. We will just have to wait until Monday. Monday I'll be in jail. On Monday we'll be in Europe! Wait a minute. I've got a better idea. We're gonna get the ruby tonight, give it to the cops by tomorrow and be in Europe on Monday. My bank? -Yeah. -Me? -Yes! -No! -Yes! -No! [PHONE RINGING] GUS: Go! Oh! [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] Shit! What? Oh, Dad, sorry. Now? He wants us to go downstairs. Okay. Yeah, we'll be right down. [CHUCKLING] Look! Beauty, huh? -What a car! -Want to go for a ride? -JUNE: No. Who did you steal this from? -GUS: Yeah! I didn't steal it. The Turks gave it to me. What do you mean the Turks? We made a deal. Want to go for a ride? No, I don't want to go for a ride! What kind of deal? I promised that we get the ruby to them by tomorrow at 8:00. -What? -Just take it back. I know what you thinking, Gus, but you're wrong. The Ferrari's just a down payment, a show of good faith. We're getting two million dollars in US currency, too. Just return the car! I can't. They threatened us a little. How little? They said if we didn't get the ring to them, they'd chop our heads off. [CHUCKLING] They're gonna chop our heads off? It's just a deal point, part of the negotiations, something to keep 'em happy. So my advice is, give 'em the ring. My advice, Bruno, is get out of here now! What about the Turks? What about the Turks? I don't know about the Turks. I'm going to deal with the Turks, somehow. -How? -How? Without you. That's how. Now, go! -Okay, okay Gus, take it easy. -Oh, take it easy. Sure! By Monday we'll be dead. Take it easy. Okay, well, how are you going to take care of the Turks? We gotta rob my bank and then give the stone to the police! -[TIRES SQUEALING] -A bank job? Out! JUNE: I just, I haven't got a dishonest bone in my body. -GUS: Bruno, your father? -JUNE: Of course, he is. But I don't know anything about robbing a bank! Don't worry, he doesn't either. Oh, I find that hugely comforting, thank you. June, relax. I just need one assistant. All you got to do is follow my instructions. I can't do it. Forget it. I haven't got the stomach for it. Especially not my bank. First instruction, hold this, don't move. What are you... -Good evening. -WOMAN: Good evening. Have a nice meal. WOMAN: Thank you. MAN: Thank you. Hey! Second instruction, get in. [GUS CHUCKLING] Stolen car, can't trace the plates. Oh, I'm going to rob my bank in a stolen car! I borrowed it, we'll give it back in an hour. GUS: [ON SPEAKER] Hey, June, if it makes you feel better, we're going to buy the rest of the stuff we need. Okay? -[BIRDS CHIRPING] -Oh, boy, now you get to see where I work? Yes? Where I used to work. I don't think I'm going to work there anymore, you know, but that's okay. June! June! Release 'em. -[CHIRPING] -Okay, they're coming. Go on, come on, [BLOWS] Come on, come on, here they come, Gus. Go on, go on, that's it, that's it! [BLOWS] Flight's in, flight's in, Gus. [BIRDS TWITTERING] Okay! [HEAVY BREATHING ON TV] [WOMAN SCREAMING IN TV] [ALARM BLARING] [BOTH SCREAMING] -What the hell was that? -[ALARM CONTINUES] LA Bank, motion detector! GUARD 1: I'll call the bank manager! It's birds! Do you think they're armed and dangerous? [GIGGLES] We've got to call the police anyway. What's their number? I don't know, nine something. [ALARM STOPS] Hey, June! -Yeah? -GUS: Having fun? [BLOWS] You bet! [POLICE SIRENS BLARING] Get ready. Okay, yeah. Now! [GAS HISSING] Gas is flowing. [INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO] [HISSING CONTINUES] [BIRDS CHIRPING] Birds? -[IMITATES GUNSHOT] -[BIRD SQUEAKS] All I did was go... [IMITATES GUNSHOT] What's wrong with you, guys? You're fool... Fooling, fooling around... You know, those cops are going to be there for hours. Do you mind? This is my favorite part of the picture! This is where she takes the hanger and sticks it in his eye. [CAMERA CLICKS] [HEAVY BREATHING ON TV] [WOMAN GASPS ON TV] That's the bank, just as the party's far-reaching intelligence network predicted. Okay. Now, you bring me Gus, and I will get you out of the country with the ruby. Deal! Yours! Long live the glorious New Armenian Liberation Party! Yeah, right, long live, right. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] You take care of that Armenian weirdo right after you take care of Gus' girl and then you bring Gus with the ruby to me! Got it, boss. Come on, Gus, come on! Hey! Yo, Gus! GUS: June, just listen. -[ALARM BLARING] -[BOTH SCREAMING] Gus, what was that? -GUARD 1: Exploding birds! -Holy shit! June! June! I'm in! [CHUCKLING] Breaking into the bank, huh? No! I thought this... Actually would be a kind of an opportune spot maybe to meet some new folks. [HISSING] Damn! Why is it taking him so long? [ENGINE STALLING] [SIGHS] Ah, good man! Ah! Come on, let's go! -It's dead. -What's dead? The car, it just doesn't work. The key. GUS: Shit! JUNE: Gus! Gus! Give it to me, or another life is on your hands. Another? [POLICE SIRENS BLARING DISTANTLY] My grandmother. You killed your grandmother? She was honored to die for the cause. Now, give me the ring, or I blow my father's brains out. GUS: Shit! -Dad! -GUS: Bruno! How about a ride now? [POLICE SIRENS BLARING] What the hell is going on here? -Bruno? I... -Yeah? I'm sorry for everything my kind has ever done to you. That's okay. I'm sure they didn't mean it. Boy, I hope he's thinking of something. I hope so too, no one should look that serious unless they're thinking of something. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Look, look, look, it's on! -Hey, Gus! -JUNE: Gus! [BRUNO WHISTLES] ANCHOR: The thief was apprehended by police chief Francis Mahoney late this evening. He is identified as Benjamin Arthur Klopzik. Mahoney said his arrest was the result of the work of a team of police detectives working around the clock. MAHONEY: [ON TV] Yes. We did pick up the no good[BEEPS] piece of[BEEP] jaboni tonight. We got his[BEEP] mother too. It just goes to prove what good can happen when the[BEEP] public cooperates with the police. And that bad things can happen when no talent[BEEPS] jabonis don't. Thank you. Okay. We got to get the ruby to Mahoney and the Turks. That's impossible! -No, it's not. -Yes, it is. -No, it's not. -Gus, it's impossible! -No, it's not. -You have a plan? -I do. -Oh, that's different then. We got to be at Arco Towers in Long Beach by dawn. GUS: Let's go! [ENGINE REVVING OVER SPEAKER] -GUS: Every thing's set? -JUNE: Yeah. -GUS: You know what you have to do? -JUNE: Yeah. Pst! Pst! Hey! Pst! Pst! [THUD] Providence, boys, just pulled in. Oh, Dad? Good luck. Go on. They're coming up. I'm ready for 'em. That's everyone. Oh, yeah? Well, then, who was that? CIA dogs! Let's go! CIA? Look, you go and... I'll stay here and keep watch. Okay? [ELEVATOR DINGS] The south elevator locked. Gus, all yours. [CHUCKLES] LEON: Tenth floor, north tower. -Better not be dicking with me, Leon. -Oh, stop it. He's coming up. Tenth floor, huh? Let's surprise them. Take the stairs. [CHUCKLES] Very clever. MAHONEY: Did you give him permission to call me that? I told him to call you Frank. Two minutes, two minutes from when? Two minutes from two minutes ago. Gus, I've got the diamonds. [GRUNTING] GUS: Morning, guys. Do you have the Fire? Of course! Do you have the money? Of course! Your partner specified small unmarked currency. There is two million one dollar bills in this bag. Bruno! -GUS: Bruno! -Yeah? You're an idiot! Oh, Gus, I'm getting a little static on the headset. Okay. How do I know that the ruby is in there? Have a look! All right, all right, close the box! Close the box! -Is it closed? -Yeah! Okay. How do we make the exchange? -See the rope? -Yes. -Move over. -Okay. You go and cut him off! When I get the ruby, you bring back the money. Okay? Okay! [CHUCKLES] Bruno! Bruno, get ready. Don't worry. I've got everything under control! BRUNO: Oh, shit! [GROANS] Watch your step, Abdul! You want fire? I'll show you fire! I'll show you fire! I'll show you fire! No doubt about it, we are being dicked, dicked, dicked! Just keep moving. Clever. Very, very clever. Wait! Wait! You call that a deal? Bruno, I'm dropping the money. [GLASS SHATTERING] -BRUNO: That isn't part of the plan, is it? -It is now. [SCREAMS] Oh! Give it to me, or I will make myself an orphan. What? Nice! Geez! Dicked! Dicked! Dicked! That's what he's done to us! All right. Cardinale! Where's the ruby? I'll get it for you. Oh, my God! Whoa! Him! That's the one who dicked us! Gus! What are you doing? I was just asking myself the same question. Cardinale! Look at me, Cardinale! [GRUNTING] Come back here, you, lying sack of shit! Listen! Listen to me! [GUNS COCKING] Hey, don't try anything stupid, pal! What could be fucking stupider than this? -LEON: Chief! -Come... Come back here! Chief, here's a way out! Shoot it, Leon. I'll take care of it. After you, Leon. [GRUNTING] [YELLING] [BOTH EXCLAIMING] Man! Now, our guns are down there! Get the ruby to Mahoney. I'll do it! I'll do it! [PANTING] Oh, okay, we'll go this way. This way is fine with me. Oh, Dad. Give me the ring. -No problem. -[BOTH GASP] Watch it! Let's get out of here. [BOTH YELLING] First, we'll finish the deal. You get the ruby to Mahoney, you get the... I'll take that, thank you very much. [YELLING] And thank you... Liberation! New plan! You get the car, you get the money and I'll get the stone to Mahoney! Wait! I get the what? The car! Oh! Should I rip out your teeth before or after you give me that ruby? After. [ENGINE REVVING] [SIGHS] Do it to it, Leon. [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] [LAUGHING] Hold it right there! You're under arrest! Hold it! [BOTH YELLING] You have the right to remain silent! [CAR HORN HONKING] I said stop! Stop! We're the CIA! [TIRES SCREECHING] Clever! Very clever! [YELLING IN PAIN] MAHONEY: Leon, give me the ring. Leon! I would like to thank Chief Mahoney and his men for apprehending the guilty party and returning the Byzantine Fire to its rightful owners. Thank you very much. The Fire will be returned to its native land. Where it will be enshrined in the sacred temple of the people of Turkish descent. That one is $50,000. Oh, boy. -So? -Hmmn! -We'll think about it. -Yeah. -Thanks for all your help. -Thank you. What do you think, huh? Oh, pretty! -Bruno, it's you. -Yeah. Let's go. Damn! Thanks so much. Thank you. Oh, we'll be back!
