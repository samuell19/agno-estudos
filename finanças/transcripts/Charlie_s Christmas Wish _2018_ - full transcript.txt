Star light, star bright, wish I had a home tonight. Is anyone out there? Please, God, I need a rescue! It is so cold in here. I'm always right here, Charlie. I'm always right here. There's so many. Yeah, there's a lot of them and they all need a home. Yeah. Oh, this one's cute. Hmm, I wish we could find them all homes. Oh, Michael! Bring him in here. I need a rescue right about now. My time is getting short here. You know... I've got a really special dog in the other room. I think you're really going to like him. - You want to take a look? - Yeah. Yeah, let's go, come on. This way. Charlie, here's your rescue. Scoot out over now and give Jimmy a high five. - Jimmy, meet Charlie. - Wow. This is the one. He's so cute. Your "him" is actually a "her", I think. Still named Charlie, though. He's all yours, Charlie. He'll have a challenge or two that I will need your help with, but you will be warm tonight. - Thank you, God. - My greatest pleasure. Can I pick her up? Yeah, she's all yours. Easy! Easy, guy! Why don't you go introduce Charlie to the rest of your family, huh? - Yeah, of course. - Ah, he'll get the hang of it. Mom, you should have seen it. We won, and I scored the last goal! It was awesome! That is great news, Jimmy! Hey, Emily? Can I get a couple of hot chocolates down here to celebrate? Of course! Over here! Don't forget the cookie! Don't worry, Charlie. I won't forget about you. Mom, I'm so excited. I can't wait for Dad to see our soccer team. You know, your dad is coming home in January for good this time, and he's not going back ever again. - Really?! - Yes! You know, I played horrible last time he was here. Wait until he sees me play now. I know. And that's why I picked up so many extra Christmas parties, so that we can get help with the bills and spend quality time with your dad when he returns. Awesome. Which reminds me, I have four parties tonight, and the last party I am serving, which means that I won't get home until really late. So, can you get yourself home, homework done, - dinner for you and Charlie? - Sure, Mom. - Two hot chocolates to celebrate? - Thank you. - Of course. - Whoo! - To the winning goal. - Yes. Congratulations. Delish. Listen, I've got to get back to work. - Mm-hmm. - Enjoy your hot chocolate. Get home safe and sound with Charlie. - Yes, Mom. - Okay, watch for the cars. - I will. Love you. - Love you. And because of the incident last week, I'm ordering the enforcement of our leash law. We have been way too lax about penalties for dogs without a leash, collar or tags for way too long. We will have hundreds of people downtown for our parade and for Christmas shopping. So, we don't want anyone stepping into any "presents" left by our furry friends. What is the penalty for having no leash, and who is enforcing? Well, officers Vic and Don here will be enforcing the leash law. I guess things are going to be different now, Charlie. The fine is $100 for the first offence. I guess our plans have changed. Got to go to the pet store before we get our Christmas tree. Every time after that, we'll add another $100. It's going to be a killer for mom. We need to get out of here before someone sees us. All fines have to be paid before your pooch is picked up. Any other questions? Thank you, thank you. Let's go. Hi, there, Jill's Cakes and Bakes. Can I help you? Jill, it's for you. It's John's commanding officer. Jill Frost. Can I help you? Yes. Yes. I understand. Bring a pen and paper. 1400 hours. Okay. Uh-huh, 57 Fairfield. Yes, sir. I will be there to pick him up. Yes, thank you. - Everything okay? - Yeah. John's coming home tomorrow! - That's great news, right? - Yeah, I should be thrilled. But it's five weeks early. Five weeks early. And I'm so overbooked, I can't even think straight. Kate, Emily, can you take over my calendar tomorrow? - Of course! Of course. - Please. I've got to pick him up at 2:00. I'm so sorry. - It's okay, we've got this. - Don't worry about it. - Wow. - Yeah. Hi, Will. Thank you so much. Jill's Cakes and Bakes! Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Hello, Pam. You'll never guess where I'm off to. Probably not. I'm on my way to pick up John at the airfield. Why so early? I thought he was coming home in January. I know, it was supposed to be in January, but there was an incident in the barracks so they released him early. His gain, my pain. I remember what it was like when Ronnie came home from Afghanistan. He was barking orders at Mom constantly. Still does it sometimes. How is Ronnie doing anyway? Is he still there with Mom at the house? Yes, he's still there. He has good days and bad days, but she says he's turning the corner. Well, Hank said he saw him down at the Moose Lodge, and at Veteran's Park. Oh, thank goodness for Hank Wentworth. I see him riding around town with Jimmy every once in awhile. Hank has been a godsend to both of us. I mean, he's been like a grandfather to Jimmy, and he helps me with all the errands that'd have fallen through the cracks - if he wasn't there. - I wish I could help more, but since Daddy died, I have been overwhelmed helping Mom get Ronnie back on his feet again. You know, Jimmy and Charlie love to visit. Maybe we'll have them do that this week. Of course! Mom would love to see them. Charlie seems to brighten Ronnie's mood when she visits. I'm almost there. I'm a bit nervous. Actually, I'm a lot nervous. I mean, I'm excited to see him, I'm just worried that he'll be disappointed, you know? You'll be fine. What John needs most is time to adjust. It'll be wonderful for Jimmy to have his dad home for Christmas after all. Yeah, thanks, sis. It'll be a holiday to remember, one way or the other. John! - Hi. - Hi! Oh, my gosh! - Good to see you. - So good to see you. So, how did you manage to get home five weeks early? That's kind of a long and unpleasant story. But it won't affect my honorable discharge. Or my retirement benefits. That's a good thing, right? Yeah, it's a good thing. Good. Let's get you home. Okay? Nice wheels. - Whose car did you borrow? - It's mine. Well, ours. I've been doing pretty good down at Jill's Cakes and Bakes. - Jimmy know I'm coming home? - Nah. I thought we'd surprise him. Also, I hate to be the practical one in this moment, but did you ever get your driver's license renewed? Nope. I thought I could do it when I got home. It's not as easy as it used to be. Things have changed since you were last a civilian. Well, I like the new car. Can't wait to see what else is new. So, this is where we live now. Yes. I've been doing so good down at the bakery, I was able to buy us this fixer-upper. I see where I fit in already. Can you give it a chance, John? Trust me, this is going to be a Christmas to remember. You just have to stay flexible. My husband's early homecoming is not an acceptable excuse for my clients. They just want their parties to be "buzz-worthy." I'm sure I can find some things to do around the house. Where's my chair? Dad, you're really home? - Dad, you're home! - Yeah! I missed you. I thought you weren't coming home for another five weeks. Oh, you should have seen yesterday! I scored the winning goal. It was awesome. And Charlie here has been helping me practice. So, this is the famous Charlie? And my best friend. It's a poodle dog. She's actually a Maltese Terrier. It's okay, Jimmy. We'll get you a real dog. Uh-oh. It's okay, Dad. I'm fine with Charlie. Well, I'm not. It's Christmastime. We'll find her a new home. And then we'll get you a German Shepherd, like the ones that saved our bacon in Afghanistan. - Okay? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Why don't we just take this up another time? What? It's just I wasn't expecting a pit bull's snack for a dog. And I'm not a snack of anyone! Give me a chance there, Dad! This is Jill. Come on, Charlie. Yes, ma'am. Charlie, I know it's been hard. Dad, and now the mayor attacking us from both sides. I shouldn't dare ask for a collar now. Dad would just say, "Oh, I guess we can't afford the dog!" What a homecoming. "Here I come, and out goes the dog." No, we'll have to show him. You'll just have to be on your best behavior, 'kay? Well, well, well. Officer Don, what do we have here? Oh, it looks like our first offender. I thought that rule didn't apply until Monday. Well, that's where you'd be wrong, little fella. I saw you two in the crowd. If you'd stuck around until the end, you'd know that our patrol started right that minute. What's his name? Oh! Ah! It's not a him, it's a her, and I will get a leash as soon as my mom is done with work. That excuse is not gonna work tonight, all right? That's our first collar, and we're gonna need him. So, hand him over peacefully and nobody's gonna get hurt. Officer, I need another chance. My dad just got home from Afghanistan, and he's still getting used to the dog. I don't want to have to tell him that he needs to bail her out of doggy jail. - Doggie jail?! - What do you think, Officer Don? Do you think we can give this one a day's grace? Not on your life! If word gets out, then we'll be stuck in dog catcher purgatory for the rest of our police department career. Come on, Don! As far as excuses go, that's a pretty good one. Hey, hey, you heard what the mayor said. She said if we solve this problem, we can get back in our patrol car, no problem. Let's go! Hey! Come here! - Gotta run! - Good one! John. Babe. Sorry. You fell asleep on the couch. Come. Let's take you upstairs. So, what do you think? I think it's a bit big on you. No, not the shirt. I just wore it because it made me feel close to you. But now I don't have to... because you're here. I mean, what do you think? It's better than a bunk in the barracks. That good, huh? I just don't know if I'm going to fit into this new life that you've carved out for us. Well, I think you'll like it if you just give it a chance. I mean, Etowah has a bad apple or two, but not enough to spoil the whole barrel. John? John, you asleep? Good night, dear heart. Hey, Mom. Hey, you have everything you need for school? I do. Is it okay if Charlie stays here? - Why is that? - Well, there's a new leash law, and I don't want her to get caught while I'm at school. All right, I'll keep her inside. - Not to worry. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I love you! - I love you too. I will work on Dad while you are at school. - Found you! - Charlie, get off. Ugh. Not so long ago this was my side of the bed, you know. Charlie. Charlie, get out of here. Hey, move. Silly dog. Honey, can you get this mutt away from me? I'm doing my best here! Charlie, go lay down. So, what's on the agenda today? I have six parties to prepare. Thank God for Kate, Will and Emily who hold down the fort at Jill's Cakes and Bakes. Well, I'll come with you if you want. I ran a 150 soldier company. I'm sure I can handle a little catering outfit. Okay. Uh-oh. Good morning, everyone! This is John. - He's here to help. - Good morning. Welcome home. I'm Will. I manage the cafe part of Jill's Cakes and Bakes. - Nice. - Would you like a cup of coffee or tea? Coffee would be great. Nice to meet you. You too. Oh, hi! Hi, John! - Welcome home. - Kate Libby. She's sort of our frosting that keeps the cake together, - so to speak. - Nice to meet you. Would somebody mind grabbing the door for me? Sure. Thank you. - Good morning. - Morning. Morning. So, what can I do? We're short on help with all our special Christmas orders. Want to help take the orders for those two ladies there? Yeah, I don't mind. - Can I hand you this? - Yeah, I'll trade you. Thanks. What can I get you, ladies? I'll have a peach tea and cinnamon toast. Make sure you push the toast down twice. I'm a little jet-lagged. I just got back from Afghanistan. You're not messing with me, are you? Oh, no, not at all. It's a real thing. If you push it down twice, it gets hotter. Okay, good to know. What can I get you, ma'am? Yes, um... Well, I would like a pot of Earl Grey. Two eggs, poached. Wheat toast, but no butter. Vegan sausage and a blueberry muffin, warmed, split in half, and make sure it's warm in the middle. Cream cheese on the side and a glass of ice water. Actually, make that water with no ice. You know, that was a real complicated order. I'm just used to ordering a red pack or a... blue pack. Um... I'm sure we have it. I'll see what I can do. Here we go. I think you scared that poor boy. I did not! I just ordered what I always order. - Well, that's scary. - Well, did you see him? There's something wrong with his brain! What's wrong with him is you! Oh, stop it! You embarrass me. That's not good. - Oh. - I'm sorry. Can I have my jacket? Hey, Charlie! Whatcha got going on this morning, girl? You know this dog? - Of course he does! - Sure do. Hank and I are buddies. You'd be John. Welcome home. I'm Hank. Vietnam, '67-'68. Jill told me that you'd be back for good in January. She is so happy about that. You know, she worked really, really hard to give you a soft landing. I know she has. She's been great. I had a PTSD incident. They sent me home five weeks early. They set you up with anybody stateside? I have to see a shrink for six weeks, and then we'll see. You know that the best antidote for PTSD is a good dog. You got a great little dog right here. Please talk some sense into him. He's a little high strung, if you know what I mean. Charlie, you gonna come get a coffee? Come on. Yeah, let's go. - Jill's Cakes and Bakes. - Kate! What happened?! Nothing that a pound of confectionary sugar won't fix. We need a complete reorder for Mrs. Buchanan. Okay. One reorder coming up. How should I get that to you and Mrs. Buchanan? Uh... Get in the car and drive them over? You do realize what you're asking of me, correct? I'm a Southerner, and we Southerners do not drive in the snow unless it is an extreme emergency! - Oh, my battery is dying. - Jill? Hello? Jill? Hi. Did you hear anything I said? Thomas. Judy. Jimmy? Jimmy, are you okay, buddy? This is not your usual mode. Why don't you and I have a little visit after class today? We'll talk about this score, okay? Yes, sir. I'm really sorry. And Jane. Yeah. Jimmy, about this test score. You failed. The whole town knows your dad is finally home, and I'm sure this is a very exciting time for you. It's very overwhelming. I need to keep Charlie away from my dad, and now there's puppy police too. I can't help you with Charlie and the puppy police, or your time welcoming home your dad. But I can come up with some extra credit to put your math grade back on score. We'll come up with something. How's that sound? - Sound good? - Great. - Okay, have a great day. - You too. So, why so glum, my little chum? It's the jolly season. You should have the world by the tail. I failed my first math test in my life. I feel horrible. - Oh, well, um, did you study? - Yeah. - Do the best that you could? - I did the best I could. I just fell asleep halfway through the test. You fell asleep halfway through the test. Hmm. Not good. But still, all this bad grade stuff is really going to throw a wrench in my future plans. Well, you know, I wouldn't throw in the towel on something like that right away, my little friend. Well, this looks like a nice little place to get an early Christmas present for Charlie. - What do you think? - Yes, it does. Yeah. You're paying. Wait. I thought you were paying. Well, me, I... We're not just dog catchers, Don. We're police officers. We deserve respect and... and dry... ness. Look, we just get this dog situation under control, and we'll be back in the cruiser in no time, okay? - How hard can it be? - Not very difficult at all. Little tedious maybe. Well, it just depends on the circumstances, right? I tell you what, the only thing that matters is that we get these little mutts, because they're our only ticket back in the action. Yeah, you mutts! These... There's one right now! I'm going to be dry! Cheech, look out! Yeah! - Oh, Cheech! - Wait, Don. This is Mrs. Gonzalez' dog. We can't take it to doggy jail. - She can't afford that. - A dog's a dog, Vic. Well, but this one's... Ugh, I don't think... All right, Don. Come on, buddy. I can't do it, Don! Vic, get the dog. Okay, I want to be dry. I want to be dry. - Good. - Okay, come on, buddy. We're gonna go. Oh, wow, you're home early. Yeah, Hank gave me a ride home, and we got a little present for Charlie. Where is she? Well, it's funny you should ask. Two officers came by the house today looking for Charlie too. Said that she'd been seen walking around town without a leash. Oh, at least we have one now. Okay, good. Because I thought you were going to get that German Shepherd sooner than I thought. Here we go with the German Shepherd again! Did you check the back porch? That's where she goes when she knows she's being hunted. No, I'm only joking. She did come back, and I let her in, but then she hid somewhere. I'm under here. But what I don't understand is, if she knows not to go out in the first place, but she knows where to go when she's chased, then why is she not smart enough not just to go out in the beginning? Charlie! It's because she makes her rounds. She visits all the neighbors. Mrs. Wagner gives her treats in the morning. As far as I know, Charlie is the only one that visits Mrs. Wagner, except when I'm on my paper route. Yeah, it's not exactly rounds. Listen, I'm hungry. You want a sandwich? - My favorite! - Of course. Come on. Did you tell Gram you're home? She still thinks I'm coming home in January. Haven't had the heart to tell her that things got off-kilter and they sent me home five weeks early. But I'm glad to be home. You glad to see me? Of course I am! The last time I saw you, you were playing with cars and trucks. I'm in junior high now, Dad. It's all about sports and videogames. What time does your mom get home? Whenever she's done with work, but that just gets later and later this season. How 'bout when I'm done with homework, we can go pick her up for some dinner? Yeah. That's a good idea. Yeah, eat up. Mmm. Local on North or Mama Ernesta's? Local on North! They give me treats on the porch! Mama Ernesta's spaghetti. - Ah, I love that place. - Okay. What?! John! Jimmy, be careful! Jimmy! Jimmy, get her in the car, quick! Hank, is she okay? She's badly hurt! Call the vet! Tell them we're on our way. It's an emergency! - Okay. - Now! Doc. Yeah, Charlie's on her way there. I think she's been hit by a car. Yes, thank you! John, sit down. Sit. Please. You're scaring me. What happened? - I'm okay. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Oh. - What was that? This was not in the contract. Am I on to the next assignment? No, Charlie. You're going to be fine. The family you are rescuing needed a little diversion from their own troubles for a moment. So, we gave them something else to focus on. Sounds like a standard priorities check for the family. Right, boss? You're absolutely righ. I'd like to be right and feel a little less like I was tossed into the washing machine. Let's get you in to see that doctor for your check-over, and then we'll wake you back up - and you'll be fine. - Doc! Doc! Emergency! You got to help her, Doc! - What happened? - I think she was hit by a car. - It'll be okay, Jimmy. It'll be okay. - Okay. There's a little tenderness in her paw, so I can wrap it up, but... not a scratch at all. Jimmy, you need to ring your mother. Tell her that we just witnessed a miracle here tonight. - Charlie. - All patched up. You can wrap it up, but I'm gonna tear it off. Yeah. - Hey, Mom. - Hi, how is she doing? - All right. - Yeah? She's doing good? Hi, Charlie. Hey, why did Dad leave with Gram? He's decided to stay with her for a few weeks. You know, tonight kinda scared him, and he's afraid he might hurt one of us accidentally. In fact, his commanding officer warned me that he might have some re-entry issues, so we just need to give him a little bit of space. He's just going to be right up at Gram's house. You guys can go visit any time you want. Okay. I think me and Charlie are going to go to sleep. Okay. All right, come on, Charlie. Okay. It's been a tough day for Charlie. Yes, it certainly has. - Morning, Mom. - Morning. This is my friend over at the Etowah Valley Construction. It's important. Are you fixing me breakfast or are you trying to fix my life? Whatever it takes, son. I'm just here to help. - Hi, darlin'! - Morning, Nana. Oh, good morning, sweetheart. How about a little extra breakfast? I have hot biscuits in that oven, and I've got some country gravy with sausage on the stove. No, thanks. Now, mama, how's she handling this drama? Because she is in the middle of her busiest season. I don't think she has time to think about it. - Oh. - She's really worried about Dad, though. Yeah, me too. Well, I can't talk about this now. - I need to go to school. - Of course you do. - I got soccer practice after. - Ooh! - Um, can Charlie stay here with you? - Well, of course! Come on, Charlie. Come on, baby. I want to see Uncle Ron. Oh! Oh, hey! Look at that. Oh, you're okay. - Are you okay? - I love you, Uncle Ron. Okay, let's go get a sausage. Let's go, come on. Go. Let's go. You must be John. Come on in. I'm Dr. Warren. Have a seat. Ahem. So, I'm here to help you, okay? Whatever that looks like. I'm not here to judge you. I'm here to help you. Okay? I do have a few questions. Okay. Here we go. Is there anything you've always wanted to do? Yeah. I always wanted to join the military, ever since I was a young kid. And I did that. Now that chapter's over. Is it what you thought it would be? Sometimes it was. Just nothing can prepare you for... ...the things you see over there... and-and the sounds that you hear, and... the smell. And the constant anticipation of there being a roadside bomb. Just left me a little skittish. Let's look forward. That past is going to be with you for a long time. The PTSD will begin to have less of a grip on you once you replace it with a more calm experience, when you have a renewed sense of purpose. My only goal, really, is to try to get to the next day without hurting anyone. Including Charlie, this little white poodle dog that my son decided to adopt while I was away. Does the little white dog bother you? A little bit. John, did you have a military working dog? I had this dog called Tango. He died... after an IED. It happened... last year. He was my best friend for over two years. So, you lost your best friend. Do you think that's the reason that the relationship Charlie has with Jimmy bothers you so much? I suppose so. But I was planning on getting Jimmy a German Shepherd like Tango when I got back, but then he had this little white poodle dog, who follows me everywhere. And I just can't seem to shake her. There she is right now! Oh! She's so cute! Maybe she's on a mission on her own. You know, not all angels have wings and halos. I'm having lunch with Captain Jack at the hoagie shop right across from the park. Why don't you join us? Yeah, sure. Good. Let's go. Jack? - Jack. - What? I wanted you to meet John. He just came in from Afghanistan. - Hey. - Hey. How did it go at the VA's office last week? Is there anything I can help you with down there? It was okay. They want me to have more sessions with you - to help stabilize my family unit. - Mm-hmm. But hell, my family doesn't know where or how I'm livin'. I guess I was kinda mean to 'em when I got home. I don't even know how to talk to them anymore. I want you to come see me next week, okay? Okay. I'm all right, though. Just praying for a mild winter. Well, good luck with that. It's already snowed twice, and it's not even Christmas day yet. Are you working around here? Huh? I said, are you working around here? Sometimes. Have you ever heard of Etowah Construction Company? Yeah, I worked with 'em before. They hire a lot of vets. You might want to catch up with Roy Sutherland over there. Yeah, I'm actually in contact with him. I'm heading over there right after I finish this. Yeah, I got it. I want 27 floor samples on... - You John? - Yeah. Okay, let me call you right back, hold on. Blitz. Arthur told me about you. Is that your dog? - Complicated. - Complicated. All right, well, here's the deal. I'll go ahead and pick you up in the morning. I think it'd probably be best if you left the dog at home, though. I'l try, but she follows me everywhere. Okay, 6:30. Now I usually stop by the Moose Lodge. It's a reasonable spread. So, if you're hungry, that'll be the spot. How you looking on gear? I have my service helmet. Yeah, that's probably not going to work. I tell you what, you can go ahead and use mine, and that'll get you going. - What are you, English? - My dad is. I spent a lot of time over there. Complicated. Early morning, John. Emily, can you take care of the cafe for the weekend? - Absolutely. - And Kate, can you get the last four orders out for the rest of the day? Oh, yeah, definitely. Oh, just remember Christine comes in Sunday night. We're in final wedding day countdown. Don't forget me! - Thanks for backing me up. - Of course. You know it. Dinner for two. Can we get it later? Jill! Uh... We need to go over Will's wedding plans. Yeah. Okay. All me. Here you go, Cap. Looks like somebody's been busy. You working for the Etowah Construction Company now, John? I'm gonna give it my best shot. Haven't done this work in two decades. Maybe it'll get me back into shape. Lookin' pretty fit to me. Listen, Harpster's on site, so be advised everything is gonna get moved around at least three times before we get started. Got that right. Yeah. Makes for a long day. Why did you hire him if he's so inefficient? Well, he actually owns the company, John. He writes all the checks. Now you tell me. You're going to fit in great, John. Listen, he loves helping a vet, and he was 4-F himself, but he always has room on a crew for a guy like you. Hey! Hey, don't stand there like a lox! Go! Yeah, you! Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on! Just point me in the right direction. All right, bud, let's go. Tell you what, let's start right on over here. - Holy cannoli. - What? Did you win? No. Tonight is the Christmas concert at Etowah Theatre. Amy, a good friend of mine, her granddaughter's in it, and I promised that I would take her. John, isn't Jimmy in the show as well? - Yep. - Why don't you guys come with me? I mean, we can get ourselves some Christmas spirit. I don't want to go. - Come on, Jack. - I don't want to go. Well, I have to go. I need to patch things up with my son. - Can we take your truck? - Yeah, no worries. Let's do it, guys! - Come on, Jack. - Yeah, come on, Cap. - Eh. - Come on, Jack. You could use a Christmas spirit boost. I guess it won't kill me, Charlie. Let's go. Come on, Charlie. Go down there, and you have a wonderful concert, okay? - Mm-hmm. - Go. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Pastor PK, and I want to welcome you tonight to kick off the holiday season the right way, and always remember the real reason for the season. Oh, what do we got, guys? - Grab something, Hank. - Oh, yeah. I think I'll have a Georgia Peach. - Thank you. - Thank you. So good to see some friendly faces in the back, some veterans... Hank. Captain Jack. Blitz. Ronnie. Good to have you tonight. Tonight is for you, and all you've done for our country. I'm so glad you made it. It just started. - Sorry I'm late, babe. - It's all right. Before we begin tonight, I'd like to take a moment to remember an old friend, a veteran, Ollie. You remember Ollie? We lost him a year ago today. That snowstorm and cold front that came in. He died of exposure. Let's take a moment to remember him. Corey? Thank you, Corey. And thank you all for coming. And without further ado, in the spirit of Christmas, the Etowah Youth Choir. Right. Everybody, "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing." Let's be serious. From the top. Blitz, do you ever think we should mix it up a little? I mean, we're here morning, noon and night. And now, thanks to Captain Jack, we're here Saturdays. We see the same people day after day. It feels like Groundhog Day. Well, I have my reasons, man. - So I'm seeing this VA therapist. - Uh-huh. And she says you Marines are not good at sharing. Oh, is that right? I think she's right. - I appreciate it. - How you guys doing? Good, Jack. What's going on, man? By the way, Charlie come back in? I let her out earlier. I... I haven't seen her. Seen her, Jack? Not since early this morning. - You guys seen Hank? - Not yet. That ain't like him. Maybe she's gotten into something. - I'll go check. - Yeah, I'll go with you. All right. Huh. Hank! Hank! Hank, where are you? Where are you, Han? Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! Where are you, Hank? Hank! Help! Hank's over here! Charlie! Charlie! Charlie? Come on, girl. Hank! - Hank! - Hank! Hank, are you okay? - Hank. - Hey, Charlie. - Hank. - Come on, roll him on over. Oh, Hank. Hang in there with us. - Hang in there, Hank. - Can you hear me? Can you hear me? - Call 9-1-1. - Yeah. Call an ambulance, now! Well done, Charlie. Blanket. You're okay. Not Hank! Please, not Hank. After Jimmy, Hank is my best friend! Not to worry, Charlie. I like Hank too. Come on, John. - Hank. - Stay with us, Hank. What is that? Purple Heart. Hank... So, what do you call this place? Some of us call it home. So, you vets are homeless? Man. After serving your country, this is... this is where you live now? - In tents? - Something like that. So, that's why I keep seeing you in these familiar places, trying to keep warm or get something to eat, or catch a day job, huh? It's been like that for three years for me now. Where's your family? I had a couple of bad incidents with my family, which made me stray away. I just strayed away. I didn't want to hurt anyone. And I still don't. I have a nephew that plays ball for UGA. He's good! I just save money and try to see him play whenever I can. - Does he know you're here? - No. Like I told you, I try to stay under the radar. I don't want anybody to know I'm out here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind knowing. I said something I regret to his mom. She doesn't know I'm out here either. That's why we don't like law enforcement and ambulances coming around here. It blows our cover. Or it blows your covers off! Charlie! Oh, Charlie. Charlie. There you are. Come here. Are you cold? - - You saved a life today, you did. You're a good boy. I mean, girl. - Are you comfortable? - Incredibly. My biggest shock was the food. Hospital food is so underrated. Well, we just have a few more tests to run, and you should be able to eat just about anything you want. Oh, good. Now, the doctor's going to be here shortly to give you an update, but, in the meantime, I wouldn't be in any rush to get out of here. - It's really cold outside. - Yeah. Good morning, Chief Warrant Officer Wentworth. I hear we had an incident with the ticker. - Morning, Doc. - Oh. You know, I was in the Army too. Major. - Oh, good. - Yeah. So, um, there's good news here. You had a relatively mild heart attack that was complicated with a lung infection, but you're required to stay in a warm, dry place in order to recover, and you should recover fully. Good news for a lad your age, huh? - Yeah, great. - So, helicopter pilot. - Yes, Hueys mainly. - Oh. You know, you're never really tested in Medicine until you have to practice in a MASH unit. He can walk around now, with assistance. I will be happy to assist you. We'll start you walking around tomorrow. In the meantime, relax, enjoy your company and some more of the delicious hospital cuisine. I'll be back this evening. Today, what happened in this town is we discovered that great men that have served this country, veterans, they don't have a home. Those are veterans that have really protected our home... so that we can enjoy what we call a home. I mean, they're right here amongst us. Just think of Hank. It is time for this town to take action. What are we going to do? Who wants to do something, and do something now? - That's what I want to know. - I say we get a team together... and we build these vets a house. Now, who's with me? There we go! You know what, John? I agree, and I think God's already brought the team together. Check this out! We want to build some homes? Roy knows how to do that. He's an architect. Let's do it. I say let's do it! Jim, can we get the vets together? - Can you do that for us? - Mm-hmm. Excellent! Excellent! You can't build a house unless you have some land. And Mayor Aurora, do you think you can get the city council to provide some land for the vets? I can definitely find you some land, Pastor. There's the land. Let's give her the hand! What's the next thing we need to do? I think it's time to get some supplies. Come on, Blitz. Let's do it! Let's do it! It's an amazing time of year, isn't it? Lots of forgiveness in the air. Don't get your hopes up too high there, John. We've seen enthusiasm before. And once things get out of sight... dies back down into see no evil, hear no evil, do nothing. Oh, come on, Jack. Where's your Christmas spirit? Been a while since Saint Nic paid a visit. - Here, pull in here. - All right. I need to go check on Jimmy. I promised him I'd stop by and watch him play soccer. Mm-hmm. Great job, Jimmy! - Great job, bud. - Hey, Dad. - Hey, good job. - Good job, Jimmy! Charlie saved Hank's life. I'm the hero today. So, I guess we can keep her? That's good with me. Good job. - Thank you. Bye. - See you, buddy. It's a great day! Thank you very much, Mayor and Council, for donating this site for this project to be built. - What do you need? - Thanks for showing up. Absolutely. You doing all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - All right, good. Carry it over. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Yeah, man. What's up, John? Have you seen my brother-in-law, Ronnie, recently? Jill is worried about him. PTSD is tough. You know firsthand. I mean, you've just experienced that, but the encouraging thing is, look what we're doing here. All right! This is the last play. Let's play the game, we're going for a Hail Mary! That's what we're doing! Hail Mary! Let's go! It's Christmas! - Hi, guys. - How you doing? - Good! - We brought Charlie. Hey, my little girl. Why didn't you say anything, Hank? Uh... I didn't want to be a burden, upset people. - You're never a bother. - Ah. Good afternoon, my man. How are... Oh. Hi. I didn't know you had visitors. Hi. So how you doing, Hank? I'm fine, thanks, Doc. I can't wait to get out of here and get some real food. I bet you are, yeah. I'll check back with you a little later. - Okay. - Thank you. Mm-hmm. Captain Jack! Captain. Is that you out there? - Yeah, I'm here. - Hey, man. - What do you need, Rev? - It's cold out here. - Yeah. - Checking on you. Whoo. Cold night. Yeah, not as cold as the night before, though. - Whoo. - Sun kinda warmed it up. I got some canned goods up at the Moose Lodge for you and the guys. And maybe some more blankets. Always use some more blankets. - That a car coming? - I don't know. Keep it quiet, Rev. It's too cold to move right now. I read in the paper your sister is running for state Senate. Did you hear about that? Pretty impressive. She's a smart one. How you know she was my sister? Oh, way of knowing things. Don't you think it's maybe time for you to reconnect with your sister? What do you say? I'd like to see them all, but I don't know about now. I don't know if this is the right time, you know? I always got your back. Got your six, got your six. All right. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Hank, Hank, Hank, Hank. - Come on, come on, that's... - What? - Let's go back this way, come on. - Oh, come on! "Our words should be like little silver boxes with bows on top." That's like a little breakdown of what Florence Littauer's little girl said. I thought this was supposed to be a fun game. It is a fun game! Yeah, for some of us. Come on! Yeah, yeah, let's go! - Oh, stop, stop, stop. - Yeah! Whee! - You're in trouble. - What? Come on! - Hold it there and I'll... - Oh, shush. Walk. I've heard a lot about you. You're a real hero to this town. I wouldn't believe that. - Nice! - Good job! Hey, I'm Captain Jack's nephew. You can use me on anything that needs a reach. I guess. Ah, let's see what you can do. - Any kids? - No. You? I have a daughter. Shelby. I lost my wife about 20 years ago. Um, I haven't spoken to Shelby for a number of years. I just didn't want to be a burden to her. I would want to know, if it were me. It's... it's a little more complicated. A man was discovered... I think I need to have a little lie down. The man has been identified as Hank Wentworth, who has been taken to Mercy General Hospital. He is expected to fully recover. - What made this story bigger... - Let's get you lying down. - No, no. - What? ...was discovered here in the woods where there were more than a dozen homeless veterans living here for years, unknownst to the community of Etowah. They-they found the Tent City. - Oh, where is everybody? - It's okay. - No, where is everybody? - We'll find out. We'll find out, okay? - No. - I'm sure... - Where have they all gone? - I'm sure they're fine. This has been brought to the attention of Etowah's mayor Aurora Hall, and Pastor PK, who have immediately called a town hall meeting to address this issue at once. - Get some sleep. - Could you do something for me, please? Can you find Jill? Ring her, please, and get her to tell Jimmy I have the Christmas tree in the back of the truck, okay? Okay, okay. You lie down. Quiet. - Thank you. Thank you. - Jill. Shh, shh, shh. Okay. It's very cold outside. It's very heartbreaking. These are terrible conditions to be living in. - I simply can't imagine... - Yes, hello, Jill. This is Hilde calling. I'm here at the hospital with Hank and he's asked me to call you and tell you that he has a Christmas tree in his truck, and you should tell Jimmy, and that's all. Maybe you could call Hank a little bit later on, okay? Thank you, bye-bye. Doctor Johnson, please pick up line 3. Doctor Johnson, please pick up line 3. You'll be happy to know I'm not sending you home for the holidays with assignments... except for one lucky gentleman, and he may see me after class. Thank you, Mrs. Masters, for helping us use math with our gingerbread. Having fun? Good. Everyone have a great holiday! Jimmy? Jimmy. I have a timely project for you. I think you'll like this one and it will wipe out your bad grade. I'm listening. It will take a little research. I want you to find out how many towns and cities there are in America, and research how many homeless veterans there are. Figure out what it would cost to build houses for each of the vets. You might need to check with Mr. Sutherland over at the building site for help with this last part. Let's figure out what it would take, mathematically speaking, to solve this problem. - Got it, sport? - Got it. Get to work. Happy holidays. Hey, Jimmy! How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - Good. Hey, Charlie. How are you doing? So, we're building houses for the homeless veterans. Is there a way you could donate? Oh, I'd love to! Thank you. - Here's a 20. - A 20! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Thank you. You're welcome. Okay. There you go, Charlie. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas. I hope that helps. Here you go, girl. Is that better? Yeah! - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you. Hey! I've got some good news. The fundraising was so good, we get to build more of these. When we finish this one, we'll move right on to the next! So, when we get this done, we... Excuse me, gentlemen. Ho-ho-ho! And Merry Christmas. Ho-ho-ho-ho. So, when we're done with... this one... we got to do it again? We're getting really good at this, like a well-oiled machine. So... When is all this going to stop? I suppose when we've housed all the homeless vets. Yes! Yes! No more homeless... Whoa! Whoa! Ah. Did I see... Santa? Uncle Jack! I missed you, man. Missed you. I missed you too. There's Mom. Want some goodies? Got sandwiches for you, like I promised. - Thanks, mama. - You're welcome. Hey, Jack! You look well. Been a long time. Yeah, I have been really well. In fact, I've been looking all over Creation for you. So yeah, your mail still comes to the house, but I had no idea where to forward it. I don't mean you any harm. I just didn't want to get in your way. I see you're running for public office. I am. Hey, so maybe you can help me understand something, something that I just haven't been able to grasp. How does a captain in the Army, one that requires a degree, one that you happen to have from Georgia Tech... How did you end up in a homeless camp, Jack? That's not an easy answer, and not a conversation I want to have right now. Maybe after the holidays. I wish that I'd known sooner. Things are looking up. We're really making a turnaround here. That doesn't excuse the disappearing act. Some things are just beyond explanation. Hmm. But I saw how you and Howard connected. It's amazing how he's become such a nice young man, huh? Yes, he is. I follow him from afar. Our star basketball player, my nephew. Helping out just because of me. Well, some things are just beyond explanation. Well, well, well. Isn't this a pleasant surprise. Tell me, do you have a date for this evening? A date? Well, that's exactly what I had in mind. Which is why I have brought us this delicious heart-healthy meal from my most favorite Italian restaurant. Mm. A little romance. I didn't think they allowed that in the hospital. Romance? Romance is heart-healthy. - Please. - Thank you. You know, I could get really used to this. Well, I would really, really like to make this a more frequent occurrence, if I'm not being too forward. You're not being too forward, my dear. You know... I... look at this as a new lease on my life. I don't know if it's going to work in the future, or if it will, but... everything that I've done to try not to be a burden to anyone... Now? Now I'm a burden to everyone. And all I want is to be well and have my health back. Some things just take care of themselves over time, okay? And I... Well, I'd like to be a part of the next chapter in your life. I think that we could make a very nice family together. - Hey! - Hey! What do we have here? We have brought you the decorating committee. The whole class wanted to help out, so we decided to add some holiday spirit to the new houses and make them feel like a real home. You know, you and Charlie are really inspiring, you know that? Well, I've got to go. Are you going to be home for dinner? Yeah! I'll call your mom. Okay, see you at 5:00. Mr. Masters, it was so fun. Thank you. Don't forget the extra credit project. - I won't. - I'll put this on the door. All right, PK. I'll be right back with those waters. - Hey. - Hey! Is that Harpster over there? Yep, looks like he's practicing giving the dedication. I've never seen that man give a public speech in my life. - Is he going to be all right? - Ah, he just needs a little practice. - It'll be fine. - I think we can all agree on that. He's the one who put up the resources, so he's going to be the one giving the dedication. Hmm. It's the holidays again, and this time always makes me think about my father. I know what it's like... to be without a family. Especially at this time of the year. That's why I sponsor the... the homeless Christmas dinner. I love the stories that the vets tell. The stories of... of, um, being in foreign places and what it's like to serve, and it would be an honor to just join them in the places they would hang out, just for some of that camaraderie. It's just that's not the way it is. But it's gonna be different this next year. It is! Because I'm gonna travel with Santa... Santa Claus. And I'm gonna... I'm gonna deliver presents and help him spread good cheer. See, the greatest gift, the greatest gift of all that you can ever give... is to welcome someone. To include them. Frenchie? I'll include you. You include me? Frenchie? Frenchie! It looks good. - And you look beautiful. - Thank you. I'm glad you're home. So, I'm really looking forward to just spending quality time... Mom! It's December 20th! And? It's Will and Christine's wedding! You're the caterer! We're the guests! Oh, Ashley Hall is gonna be there! Oh, my gosh! You are absolutely right, and I have totally forgotten I am the caterer, and we are all invited guests. I'm not dressed as a guest, and I'm not dressed as a caterer! We've got to go. Come on! Upstairs. Let's go! - What should I wear? - Sunday best! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! I cannot believe I am late. Forgot! You're off to a wedding. I'm stuck here by myself? I don't think so. I'm heading out. Hurry up, guys! We're going to be late! - Oh, my God. - Almost ready. Put my boots on. - Ow! - Oh! Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Come on, Jimmy! It's not the evening we had planned, but... it'll be fun. Might be fun, might be horrible. The wedding planner left me a list a mile long, and I haven't seen it since. I have totally dropped the ball. You'll be okay. They probably had to get a food truck for dinner. If there is a cake, you'll be in the clear. Here they come. - Ashley! - Who is Ashley? - Isn't she beautiful? - Who? - Ashley. - Who is Ashley? That is Ashley. Her mom is moving here to Etowah. And we're going to be in the same school next year. Here comes the bride. Let me ask you a question. If you've given back every stray we've caught, how are we ever supposed to get back in the cruiser? See, that's where we have a disagreement. Are they really strays if we know who owns them? If you can get your hands on one of them, and there's not someone on the other end of the leash, then they're fair game! Okay, see... no. I don't get that either, okay? Because if I know the Chihuahua belongs to Mrs. Gonzalez, what, am I still supposed to turn it in? I mean, what if it just got out or something, huh? She can't pay no $100 fine, and you know she can't live without her Cheech. And I could not live with myself if something happened to that dog just because she can't pay. That's the job, Vic! Well, it's a horrible job, Don! Well, that's how we get back in the cruiser! Well, look, I'm out of ideas, okay? Look. Isn't that the dog that goes with the Frost family? Oh, yeah, it's a great idea, Don. Let's capture the dog of the family helping the homeless vets. Oh, that's such great PR. It's how we meet our quota. Go get her! Fine. I'll catch her if I can. - You can do this. - Oh, great, yeah. Why am I doing this? You're the fast one. - I'll help. - Oh, yeah, great! Two grown men to catch a four-pound dog. Excuse me, boss? I could use a hand here. Finally got you. Got you, Charlie. I'm so sorry. - Good evening, officers. - Good evening. Good evening. Well, I must admit your enforcement program has accomplished its goal. I see you have another one. - I'd love a miracle right about now. - I'll work on it. You know, I haven't experienced any surprises in weeks, so thank you. Do you think you could throw in a promotion for our fine officers, as an extra Christmas bonus for your angel in training here? I need these guys out of my hair. And because you've taken care of this issue so efficiently and with humanity towards some of our more delicate residents, I'm recommending to the Chief that we put you back on full police duty starting Monday. And, as a Christmas bonus, you are off-duty as of now. So, go visit your families, spend some time, or come and help us finish the home for the veterans. Sure, yeah. Most grateful, ma'am. Yeah, Merry Christmas, ma'am. It's been a pleasure to serve. We just have one more charge to turn in. Oh! What happened to the offender? - I don't really know. - Oh, well... Not our charge anymore? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas! - Where'd that... where'd that dog go? - No idea. I now pronounce you husband and wife. William, you may now kiss your bride. Ta-da! Oh, my gosh, Kate, how did you know? Well, you know, I thought you had a lot on your mind, and when I found the detailed list from the wedding planner, I just thought, "I'm gonna help you out." - Thank you so much. - You're welcome. Oh, my gosh, Will looked so happy and he would have been so disappointed if this was a huge flub. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Gorgeous cake! - Thank you. It is what made us famous. Why don't you ask her to dance before you lose your nerve? I don't have a nerve. I've been so anxious to see her, and she's so beautiful, I don't know what to say. Just say, "Hey, would you like to dance?" It's a real icebreaker. I'm not too good at dancing. Want me to give you a quick lesson? No, I'm going in. - May I cut in? - Thank you. I'm glad you could come. How was your flight? Long. Well, I think you're very pretty, and I like the dress. Thank you, but as these things go, it's the bride's choice. I'll say. Ladies and gentlemen, Christine and I are honored to share our special day with you. It's wonderful to have both our families here and... Oh, my gosh! Hank Wentworth and his new friend, Hilde Becker! Thank you all for doing this! It's so good to see you in good health, man. Congratulations. You too. You're up now. - We'll be dancing. - We'll be dancing. Hello! Come in! - Hi. - Hey, Jimmy. It's nice seeing you. - It's cold. - Yeah. I can't believe you guys have done that in less than a month. Someone could live there already. We are one city inspection away from a ribbon cutting or something. But who is living in those houses? To start with, it's gonna be Hank and Captain Jack. And they'll be able to live there and get their lives back in order. And in a year or so, they'll be moving on and we'll have some new vets move in. So, we're not leaving any comrades on the battlefield, so to speak. The homeless situation is really complicated. And the homeless veterans situation is twice as complicated. Well, why is that? We send men and women off to war, and they see just horrendous things in the battles and places that they go, stuff that we can't even really imagine. When they come home, society cannot even understand their situation. Vets hurt in a very different way. Yeah, my dad has some of that. It can be scary. Yeah. Well, I'm glad to see that he's feeling better. Giving him a sense of purpose has really helped in his healing. Oh, Mr. Masters sent me here for an extra credit project. - You want to check it out? - Sure! It's this one right here. Ah! This looks interesting. - Hey, darling. - Hey! I brought you some hot chocolate. Oh, Southern style? - Uh-huh. - Mm. That's great. Mm-hmm. Mm. Yeah. - That is Southern style. - Yeah. I've been doing some thinking. Uh-oh. Yeah, I've been, uh... I've been reminded of late about when your dad returned from his tour in Korea. I remember y'all talking about Korea. Yeah, he found it difficult to... to reunite with people at home, even with you. You know, he had a ringing in his ear, and it hurt when people talked to him, and his head hurt. He didn't know how to make you understand. It wasn't you that he was pulling away from. - You know what he did? - No. What'd he do? - Your daddy took you fishing. - Fishing! Oh! Yeah. I love fishing and he did too. - We had a great time. - Uh-uh. - Huh? - Actually, he didn't. What?! He didn't love fishing? - No. - Oh. No, no. What he did is he found a place where you and he could reconnect by being quiet. - Mm-hmm. - Got to be quiet because... - You can't scare the fish. - That's right! So, let you do the fishing, while he did the reconnecting. And it made him so happy. You know why? Because you were off together, and you were doing the thing that you loved. Mm-hmm. - Give me a hug. - Oh, you bet. Merry Christmas. You've come a long way since we've met. You know, I think building these houses has been the best thing that's ever happened to me. I've got my civilian skills back, and I really feeling like I've been contributing. Taking action is a huge step in the right direction. I want to invite you to the completion party tomorrow. It would be really important to me if you meet my family. And I think they deserve to meet the person that's helped me out so much. It's my way of thanking you for your years of service. And I want to personally thank you for helping the vets that I can't reach. Anytime, Doc. Anytime here, as well. You need me, I'm here for you. You call me, you stop in anytime, okay? Okay. So, you going to come tomorrow? It's gonna be fun. Remember fun? Okay! I'll be there. Okay, good. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Bye, John. It is with the greatest pleasure that we can dedicate these new homes before the holiday season. From the impossible to the livable, all within a month, is a miracle! - Y'all... - Ho-ho-ho! Hello, everyone! Merry Christmas to all! Ho-ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas, everyone! Ho-ho-ho! Hi, how are you? - Dr. Warren. - John! Please, meet my wife Jill. Oh, Jill! - This is the doctor. - Dr. Warren. It's so good to meet you. Mommy, what's wrong? Who is that man looking at us? He's looking at me. He doesn't know about my favorite little elf yet. That man is your grandpa. My grandpa? - Hi, Dad. - Hi, Shelby. His name is Henry. Henry, is it? Do you know that my name is Henry too? I know. Mommy told me about you, and that's how I got my name. Oh, good! Do you like Santa Claus? Not as much as meeting my grandpa. Thank you so much for what you've done for us. Thank you for your service to our country. We appreciate you. And we have a special gift for you, my friend. For as long as you need it, it's yours. A new home. God bless you. Captain Jack. You've given a lot to us. You've given us a great gift. You've protected our country, you've protected our freedoms, and I'm going to tell you the same thing, my friend. For as long as you need it, it's yours. A new home. God bless you too. God bless you. How about a Merry Christmas for all of these fine veterans? Merry Christmas! Thank you so much! Now, who wants a candy cane? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Good to see you. A bathroom. - Baby sis. - Hey, big bro! - How'd you get here? - I flew. Come here. - Man. - Oh, man, I missed you. Oh, I missed you too. Will you marry me? I have nothing. Nothing to give you. To give me? Sweetheart, you have already given me so much. So, Charlie, looks like everyone got their Christmas wish. What about you? Well, what I wish for... I wish everyone had a home for Christmas, two paws and four paws. I gave Jimmy the task to figure out what it would cost to solve the problem of homeless veterans in our country. What did you come up with? So, the population of the USA is 327 million people. It takes about $55,000 to build one house. And there's about 40,000 homeless vets living in the street and in their cars. If we multiply how many vets by the cost, we get $2 billion. And that's a lot of money. How did you get to that figure? Well, if you take $2 billion and divide it by how many people live in the United States, we get $6.63. - And that we can do. - Great job! - Hey, man. - How's it going? - There's this crack. - All right. I see you got a nasty one here. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. - All right. - Can you take care of that? - Yeah, yeah. That will be no problem. Sure. Cool. Thank you, sir. I'll go and get started. All right, we got it taken care of. - Looks good, looks good. - Sure thing. Yes, sir, thank you so much. Definitely. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Mommy's gonna like this new windscreen, huh? Oh, she's gonna be happy. Oh, yeah.
