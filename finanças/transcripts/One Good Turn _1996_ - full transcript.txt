Do I really need a new suit. Oh no. The fact of the matter is, I loved it on you. OK, so stay here and I'm going to get it for you. Happy birthday. Don't get lost. Oh God. Ow. Excuse me. Si... Simon? Matt Forrest. Remember? Oh yeah. You're the guy who bought me a drink. Yes. - How are you doing? Yes, I'm fine. How are you? I'm fine. I tried to get in touch with you when I got back to the States. And the Army said you'd gone to Germany, and then I tried you there... Look, I'd love to talk, but I gotta catch a bus. Do you... do you live here? Yeah, I moved into a small place downtown after I got out. It's nice seeing you again. Take care. - You too. - Matt? Matt, yeah. Matt? Honey, I... I thought you abandoned me. No, I just... I just saw this guy that I met in Panama. Mm-hm. Well, that's cool. Honey. Let's go. Do you remember where we parked? I don't. Yeah, we're up here. Ha! Oh. 10 years ago, when Matt and I were fledgling production assistants in New York, this man insisted that we come to LA to start our own video production company. Well, since he was the hardest working guy that I've ever met, not to mention the most persuasive, I packed up my wife and two kids and followed him west. Since then, I've watched him push, beg, manipulate, cajole, bully, and do everything else in his power to make this company what it is today. And now with "Atlantis," the sky is the limit. Happy birthday, Matt. Thank you. Thank you. I think that's great. When did you decide? A couple of weeks ago. Well, it's not like we want one tomorrow, but soon. In the future... the relatively near future. Mid-life crisis. Hmm. To tell the truth, ever since Dad died, I've been rethinking a lot of things. And then having that birthday really... Oh, come on. You know how much I want to have a baby. I shouldn't even be here tonight. Come on, Matt. The "Galaxy Station" demo isn't due until... No, I mean literally. By all rights, I should be dead. I should have died on September 5, 1983 in Panama when I was 22. My car was bombed by the Panamanian Liberation Front outside a US military bar. I turned the key, and the whole engine blew. I would have died. Only someone pulled me out before the car... I came to for a couple of seconds before they loaded me into the ambulance, and I saw the guy who saved my life. Simon Jury. That's the guy that I ran into on the street today. All you told me was that you had a car accident. Uh. Well, it was a very unsatisfactory reunion. Um... I really need to repay him somehow. Do you know where this guy lives? Somewhere downtown. Look, I know a guy. We're gonna call him tomorrow. OK. Thanks. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. Hey, prosperity suits you well, man. Thanks a lot, Joe. Yeah. Now, he told me about your situation. And, uh, I gotta tell you something, Matt. I don't like mysteries. There was this one time in college I had this crossword puzzle. I finished the whole thing in one afternoon... except for two clues. I sat up the whole following day, the whole following night. I finally got one clue on the fourth night. But I stayed up the whole fucking week. How long do you think it will take you to find him? No time at all. Remember, we're working with the government. Maybe only one lifetime. Not on my account. With my little PC here, I can locate every Simon Jury in the LA area. Good morning. Good morning. Yes, exactly, exactly. Hello, Matt. Call line four. Yeah? Matt? Joe Santapietro. Excuse me. This is Matt Forrest. I think I found your guy. The only Simon Jury, same age, similar description. Got out of the Army a year ago. I haven't talked to him yet, but his super down at his apartment believes that this guy was in Panama in '83. You sure it's him? Well, if you want to be 100%, you're gonna have to wait till I get the details from the Army records and social security. No, I'll go by this weekend. Good. Covetous. Pardon? 32 down, 8 letters. "We witches love to deceive." That drove me crazy for one week. Look, thanks very much. Hey. Hey, spare change, man? Hey. - Sorry. Come on. Can't you help... Sorry. Good morning. I'm looking for Simon Jury. Room 203. Hey. Use the stairway. Elevator's busted. Thanks. Can you shut your baby up! Hello? Hello? Can I help you? Oh! I'm sorry, Simon, to show up out of the blue like this, but... How did you find me? I hired a detective. Let's go outside. It gets stuffy in here. I got out of the Army about a year ago. I should have stayed in. There's not a lot of work for soldiers outside of the service. Well, don't you have some sort of military pension? Nah, you gotta be in for 20 years to get one of those. I get a 30% disability 'cause I messed my knee up. But most of my savings went to cover my mom's funeral. I get by. Now, why'd you go to so much trouble to find me? I never got a chance to thank you. What you did that night... well, I've never risked my life to save anybody else's. You've never had to. When you look into someone else's eyes and you see they're gonna die if you don't help, then you don't see another person. You see yourself. After that, there's no choice. Simon, I'd like to help you till you get back on your feet. I appreciate the thought, Matt, but I don't want your money. Well, if you don't like the idea of a gift, just think of it as a loan. No. I was just in the right place at the right time. That's all. You don't owe me anything. It's not that I'm not grateful. I just don't want any charity. Would you consider a job offer charity? With my production company. Well, it's nothing you're not qualified for. You know, it's glorified gopher to start until you learn the ropes. Well, it's a really nice offer, Matt, but it's kind of hard for me to take any full-time work right now. My buddy next door is dying of cancer, and I've been helping to look out for him. If you change your mind, you promise to call me? Hmm? I promise. Thanks for coming by. I don't think so. Let me know if you need anything. You can't keep torturing yourself. You have to let it go, you know. It's probably for the best anyway. You didn't know anything about him. He was too proud to, you know, let me repay him. But he's living like a bum. Maybe you're the one that's being too proud. I'm not too proud of the fact that if the roles had been reversed 12 years ago, I don't... think I could have done the same. Honey. Come here. You're one of the strongest people I've ever met. You just have to learn that sometimes things are beyond even your control. Let it go. Jesus Christ. This is Matt Forrest. Simon? How are you? Not so good. I'm calling from the hospital. The friend I was telling you about passed away this morning. Listen, I was thinking about what we were talking about. Maybe I could use a clean break. Is the job offer still good? Thanks. That's great. Thanks a lot. See you around. Oh god, you're early. I haven't even changed yet. Honey, this is Simon. Simon, my wife, Laura. Hi. Hi, nice to meet you. Sorry for my appearance. You look great. I really appreciate you guys inviting me to dinner. Sure. Well, we're happy to have you. Well, let's get you something to drink and show you around. I'm just gonna run upstairs and take a shower real quick. So you never got married? No, I never found the... the right lady, I guess. I... I was in love once, but that was a long time ago, and things didn't work out. More wine, Simon? Yeah, thanks. So that old, um, Eastlake chair in the hall. Looks like it's seen better days. Yeah, I was just gonna take it in for restoration tomorrow. You're interested in antiques. Yeah, my dad's business back east was antique restoration. Really? Well, Laura has her own antique store. Yeah. Really? Mm-hm. Well, I'd be happy to get that chair back in shape for you. Save your trip. You don't have to do that. No, I'd enjoy it. Well, that'd be really sweet. So you, um... you start work tomorrow? Uh-huh. I'm gonna have to find you an old car because that bus trek is just too long, you know? That... that's OK. My apartment lease is up soon, and I'll just rent somewhere near the office. When's your lease up? This weekend. It's not that easy to find apartments over there. No. Why don't you stay at our pool house? There's no one there. Well, that wouldn't be a problem, would it, honey? No. Well, then it's settled then. That's really kind of you. I... I appreciate it. No, it's nothing. Not at all. Uh, let me give you a hand, Laura. No, no, it's OK. Matt and I will take care of it. Yeah. Sit, sit down. Thank you. So, uh, where'd you find that Eastlake anyway? They're kind of hard to come by, aren't they? Oh god. I've had it so long. Um... New Orleans, I think. I buy stuff all over the place. Who's for dessert? Laura's specialty. Apple pie. You know, I love New Orleans. That's a fun city. You get down there much? Not anymore, really. I prefer to buy closer to home now. Well, let's eat this before it gets cold, huh? I'm gonna go get some silverware. Are you sure I can't give you a ride? No, I'm positive. I gotta walk some of this dinner off, and then I'll just hop on the bus. All right. Uh... say, Matt. Yeah? Did I say something at dinner that upset Laura? Oh, no, don't worry. That had nothing to do with you. Laura and I have a good marriage, you know. We have our rocky moments, like everybody. Uh... a few years ago in New Orleans, Laura had an affair with an antiques dealer that she was working with, and we nearly split. We worked things out. It wasn't easy, but we're stronger than we've ever been. And, uh, we're even considering enlarging the population. Well, I'm glad. You guys seem right for each other. Thanks. So I will see you tomorrow. I'm looking forward to it. Big day. - Better get my rest. - Yes. Goodnight. Are you sure? Oh yeah. Hey, Matt, where should I put this? Oh, just put it on the desk. Thanks, Simon. Tokyo on two, Matt. Simon. Some of us are going across the street for lunch. Would you like to join us? Oh gee, I'd like to, but I... I've got some errands to run. Oh. All right, just let my office know. Thanks. Great. Hello. Where were we? Oh. I'm sorry. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? I, uh, wanted to show you something. It's identical to the Eastlake you have. It's in a museum in Connecticut. And... and if you like, I could give yours the same finish. Yeah, that'd be great. I was really excited when I found it. So how's the new job going? Great. I am really grateful to Matt for giving me the opportunity. I think he feels like you're the one that deserves the gratitude. I don't know. I never felt like I did anything so wonderful. Maybe I'd feel differently if I'd saved the girl too. The girl? Yeah, in the car with Matt. There was... was someone else in the car? Oh, I'm sorry. I thought that... she was a local girl. And I went back for her after I pulled Matt out, and... Was she a friend of Matt's? I don't know. I mean, I guess you'd probably have to ask him. Anyway, I just wanted to show you this. So I really gotta get back to work, OK? OK. So long. See you later. OK. I just can't believe you never mentioned that somebody else was with you. Somebody that died. I think it's really weird, Matt. I mean, is that the reason why you never told me in the first place? No. Who was she? It was just a girl that worked in the bar some nights, I think. - Oh, great. So she was a hooker. No. So she was just somebody that you didn't know, but you decided to give her a ride home anyway? Look, Laura, it was a long time ago. What... You survived, Matt. But she didn't. Look, I was drunk. I... I asked her to come back with me. She was going to come and spend the night. It wasn't like you've never had a one-night stand. I never paid for it. And nobody died as a result. Oh, like it's my fault they bombed the damn car! Look, I did not force her to come with me. I can't keep blaming myself. I didn't kill her, Laura, so stop looking at me like that. I'm not saying that. Well, what are you saying? I just don't understand why you never told me. Hey, you guys. I'm not too early for dinner, am I? No. No, come on in. Do you want some wine or anything? You have reached the offices of Power Play Interactive. No one is here to take your call. Please leave a message after the tone. This message is for Matt Forrest. This is Joe Santapietro. Please have him call me. I finally got a report back from an old buddy in social security. There's something interesting here. I thought... - Joe? It's John. Hey, man. How's it going? Good, good. Uh, Matt's not here. Everybody's gone for the weekend. It's probably not important, but pass it on anyway. He made an application for unemployment benefits last year and listed his military service from '81 to '84. Now, I may be wrong, but I thought he told Matt that he got out of the service last year, not 11 years ago. Well, that's what Matt told me. Well, it could be a mistake, but I doubt it. So pass it on anyway, will you? You have a good night, man. Yeah, you too. Yeah, you, uh, Mr. Jury? Yes. Well, the mailman put your mail in my box, man. You see, I live, um, across the way, you know. In the pool house in the back. It's a guest house. My mom kind of kicked me out, so that's where... that's where I'm living right now. Oh, I'm sorry about that. You see, it was... it was right on top, you know, and I thought it had something to do with my unpaid parking tickets. So I just, you know, I didn't even look at the name. I just, like, opened it right up, and, um, sorry, man. It's all right. Thanks. Come on in. All right. Cool. Cop a squat. All right. What's your name, man? Uh, Brent. Uh, Mr. Jury? Hey, call me Simon. OK. So, uh... you... you really on parole, man? Uh-huh. What, um... what'd you do? Didn't pay my parking tickets. So, Simon. What... what brought you out to Los Angeles, man? Well, I came here to look up a guy I hadn't seen in a while. I found him shopping. So they, uh... they teach you to drink like this in the Army? Is that... It's like, be all that you can be. You know? Oh! So what... like, what... what other, you know, um, tidbits of information did they bestow on you in the service? First, you find your enemy's weakness. Then exploit it. And once you got him totally vulnerable, you finish him off! That's cool, man! Or you keep the chase going just for the hell of it. Aw yeah, man. Come on, anything else? I gotta use the head. Why don't you have another beer, hmm? Be all that you can be. You're going through my stuff? Uh... no. No, man. Um, it just, uh... just fell right off the counter here. Is that your girlfriend? Not anymore. We split up not long after that photo was taken. A month later, she was killed. Really? Wow. Say, Brent. You like to get high? High? You know, smoke dope. Well, yeah, I mean. Uh, let's go for it, man. But we gotta take it outside. This ain't my place, and they might get pissed. Go! Go! Go! Yeah! Close, man. Oh. You call that close? Yeah. I used to live nearby here. I'd come down here at night, and I'd watch the trains go by. I'd count 'em. Must be at least half a dozen go by between now and midnight. Big freight cars. Wow. So, man, did you... did you ever have to kill anybody, you know, when you were in the Army? I'll tell you this. War will teach you something you'll never learn anyplace else. What's that? Faith. What, like, um, God? Religion? Pfft. No. Trust. Trusting yourself. Trusting your buddies. The kind of trust that you can't get with a woman. It can only exist between men. There was a game that we used to play in my outfit, only it wasn't a game. You want to see how it works? Yeah. Come on. All right. Now, you stand under that light, OK? And put your hand up real high. I'm gonna stand on the tracks facing you. When that train gets real close, you drop your hand, and I jump out of the way. That's crazy, man. It's about trust. - All right. - You wanna go for it? Hell yeah. It's not a joke, man. My life's in your hands. I got you. I'm right here. Yeah! Yeah! Whoa! Yeah! Yeah! Whoo! Yeah! All right! Whoo! You trusted me, man! You trusted me! Of course I trusted you. Hey. You ready to trust me? Yeah! All right, let's go for it. Go, go. All right, man. Right here? OK. Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah! Oh, yeah! Yeah! Whoo, man! Oh, yeah! Oh! Man, we're... we're like brothers, man. You know? That was... that was a rush. That was... that was, like... let's do another one. - Another one? Yeah. I'm into it, man. This was, like... it was, like, better than sex. What would you know about sex, you little pussy? I ain't no pussy, man. I am no pussy. All right. I am no pussy. OK, now watch my hand. Yeah. Right now, man. Here we go. I'm ready. Are you ready? Whoo-hoo! Let's do it, man! Yeah! Is it coming? I can't hear it. I can't hear it. Yeah! Let's go! Whoo! Whoo-hoo! Come on! I will say it to you. I am not a pussy! Look at that girl over there, man. God, I gotta take her home. Maybe she's not hustling. I don't care if she's hustling or not. God, she's beautiful! Mariam. Take it easy. That's funny. Did you know that Simon's girlfriend spent the night last night? I don't think he has a regular girlfriend. Oh, great. So it's someone he just picked up off the street. - Did you see her? - Yeah. She was helping herself to the contents of our refrigerator in the middle of the night. It's not funny! I mean, it's OK if he's spending the night, you know, but I don't think it's appropriate that he's bringing women home. Honey, he's a single guy. What do you want me to tell him, that he should be celibate while he's here? I mean. Well, yeah. Maybe while he's staying here. I think it's really rude. Come on. It's gonna be OK. Look at you. You're so beautiful. Shit, they're here. Smile. So there we are in Panama. The United States Army... a horde of nasty, crazed GIs ready to save the free world. We end up blasting Noriega with rock and roll. It was ridiculous. So you were in the Army until just last year, Simon? Uh-huh. I was stationed mostly overseas. Germany, the Philippines. I was in Saudi during the oil war. Actually, we probably saw you on CNN. Oh, speaking of oil, I happened to notice a ton of it under your car. Oh, I know. I've gotta take that in and have it looked at. You keep saying that. Well, I'm gonna do it next week. It's like the Exxon Valdez was parked there. Didn't I just say that I was gonna take that in and have it taken care of? Does anyone else once want some salad? There's plenty in the kitchen. Let me give you a hand. We need to talk. We do? Santapietro called the office last night. According to social security records, Simon got out of the Army in 1984. That was 11 years ago, Matt. Well, he's obviously mistaken. Maybe. But I'm telling you, there's just something about this guy that I don't particularly trust. Yeah, I'd say it's definitely a problem with the oil pan gasket. I'll get the part tomorrow. Great. Great. Well, you look like a guy with a lot on his mind. What's up? Um... that detective I hired, uh, says he's got records that show you got out of the Army in 1984. What records? Social security. I'm sorry, Matt. I lied to you. I was ashamed to admit how badly things had gone for me. It seemed like it was OK to tell you that I'd been slumming for a year or so. But the truth is, I've been picking up odd jobs here and there for over 10 years. Things got bad. And I felt like a real loser compared to you. I'm sorry, Simon. I didn't mean to put you on the spot like that. It's OK. I feel better now that you know. I was beginning to feel like a real fraud. Well, don't. Thanks. Come on. Say, Matt. Do you think it was just chance that we ran into each other? Sometimes I think maybe there was a greater design. Well. Maybe. Maybe. Laura? Laura? Oh, hi. Hi. Is Matt around? Um, no. He, uh... he had to take care of some things at the office. Oh. Well, I wanted to show you something. The finish is done. I just have to reupholster it. It looks great. Come here, I want to show you something. Come on. See how smooth the texture is? Yeah. When... when are you gonna be finished? Well, I was hoping today. I was thinking of moving out this week. You found an apartment? No, but I can tell you guys need some space. Yeah, it's been a little tense between Matt and me, but it has nothing to do with you. I think we're probably going to go away for a few days over Thanksgiving. And, I don't know, hopefully we can, you know, relax then. Where are you going? Um, we have a country house that's a couple hours out of town. And, um... it's been a rough year for Matt. You know, with his dad dying and all. And he really doesn't have the outlets that he used to. Outlets? He quit drinking a couple years ago. Yeah. It can be tough when you run out of vices. You don't look like a man who has too many vices. Of course I do. Like what? You wouldn't want to know. I'm gonna get back to work on this thing. OK. Matt? Fan mail. Look at that. Hmm? Wow. You know what's great about the home entertainment market? If you do it right, you can reach millions of people all over the world. God, that's a hell of a lot of power. Better than sex. Yeah. And we are on the brink of selling a new game to one of the biggest distributors in Japan. And if we do it, that'll take us right to the top. Fantastic. Has this game got a name? "Atlantis." "Atlantis." Yeah, they're choosing between ours and another company's over the holidays. I gotta get rid of some of this nervous energy. I'm gonna hit the gym. - Oh jeez. It says here some kid got hit by a train Saturday night right near where I used to live. They found traces of drugs in him. Man. I don't know if these kids are ever gonna learn. Well, later, huh? Yeah. Hey, Simon? You putting in some overtime? Oh, no. Matt told me to use the computer so I could learn the ropes in my spare time. Say, Kristen. Uh... you going anywhere for the holiday? No. I mean, my family wants me to go back to New York, but I can't really afford it. And you? I'm staying right here. Uh... do you like Cajun food? Don't know. I mean, I don't know if I've ever really had it. Well, I was gonna try this place tonight. I was wondering if you'd like to join me. Sure. I want to thank you for coming and meeting me on such short notice. Oh, it's no problem. So what'd you come down here for anyway? All that information that you found out about Simon was correct. Then when Matt asked him about it, he said he was too embarrassed to admit that he'd been out of work for so long. Matt's so damn stubborn. You know, I just get this really weird vibe from this guy. All right, what do you want me to do? You want me to dig deeper? It would be great. The problem is that Matt doesn't understand, and, you know, he's not gonna... Don't sweat it. Thanks, Joe. What is it with Matt? I had a great time tonight. I had a great time too. Thanks for asking me. It was my pleasure. I should have asked you sooner. - Really? Yeah, really. I have a great view. You want to see it? Yeah. Wow. You know, I thought you were cute the first day you came into the office. No kidding. So what about when you came into the office at lunch today? What'd you think then? Huh? What do you mean? Did you still think I was cute? You looked at me like I was stealing state secrets. Well, there's nothing sexier than an industrial spy. So you trust me? Yeah. You really trust me? Huh? Yes. Really? Yes. Let go of your hands. Yeah. I got you. It's OK. I got you. ...with a surprise upset, beating the Bullets 108 to 99. Mr. Salako? 650. Mr. Salako. $30. Mr. Salako. Can I help you? Mr. Salako. Uh, Joe, Joe Santapietro. I talked to you on the phone a couple of days ago. Yeah, I remember. You, uh, still looking for Mr. Jury? Yeah, good. 'Cause he ain't here. He suddenly left at the end of last month. No. He's gone? Don't tell me that he's... oh man. Oh. It's my fault, it's not yours. I can't believe this is my work and I can't... I can tell by your eyes, with the discipline, you were where, in the service, right? You fought in the war? Yeah. South Central. - South Central where? Pacific? The riots. The riots. I'm sorry. You remember, uh, when we talked I'd asked you if he'd... well, he lived here for one year, right? Um... did... did he... did he talk about any other place he might have lived before that? He mentioned Germany one time and then a couple other places. And other places. Do you think anybody in the building might know where he might have gone? I doubt it. Anybody besides the guy that was, uh... his friend that lived next to him, the one that died? - What guy? - The one that died. Look, I don't know where you get your information from. Nobody in this building died. The only people to live next to him was Mrs. Lorriey in apartment and the Lee family in apartment 204. And believe me when I tell you. All the damn noise they make, they ain't dead. Did you buy a bottle of vodka recently? What? Simple question. Did you buy a bottle of vodka? N... no, I didn't. Why? Because there's a half empty bottle up in the kitchen cabinet. Well, it probably belongs to Simon. I already asked him. He doesn't drink vodka. Well, it's probably leftover from our Christmas party. It wasn't there last week. Hello. Matt? Yeah. Matt, I just got off the phone with Santapietro. I think there's something you ought to know about Simon. Not that crap again. There was no friend in the next apartment who died of cancer. There was no friend period. I think the guy's working you. Yeah? Well, how would Santapietro know that? He asked the super of the building. Look, I already paid him in full. What is he doing? He said he'd ask a few questions as a favor to me. Oh, great. So now you're working behind my back too. Look, Matt... Goodbye, John. Come in. How you doing, Matt? You OK, man? Can we talk for a second? Sure. A detective I hired to find you keeps finding information after the fact. He doesn't believe that you had a friend die of cancer. He doesn't believe that there was any friend at all living next door to you. Man, if you want me to leave, why don't you just say so? You don't have to go checking up on me. I know you gave me a job and a place to live, and I appreciate it. And you've got a right to know as much as you want to find out about me. But, I mean, do you think I'm lying to you? Really? Well, I just... It was my old apartment building. My friend that your detective says didn't exist. He lived in my old apartment building down in Echo Park where I first lived when I came to Los Angeles. Oh god. Oh! You gotta learn to relax. What happened to that party animal that I met down in Panama? The guy who just had to have that woman. Here. Old times. Salud. Ooh! Oh! What's wrong? I... I stopped a couple of years ago. I'm sorry. I forgot. No, it's all right. It... it's just... you just don't seem like a guy who would have a problem with alcohol. I mean, you seem like you're so in control of your life. Well. I didn't go to AA or anything. I just stopped. I'll bet you can start and stop anytime you want. I stopped when I had to. Yeah. Hmm. You know, if I had your restraint, my life would have turned out real different. You did something that most people could never do. Yeah. Someone still died. Yeah, but that wasn't your fault. No, I guess it wasn't, was it? So what time are you leaving tomorrow? Oh. Well, we were gonna leave around lunchtime. Uh, miss the holiday traffic. Good idea. I'll have the car ready by then. Goodnight, man. Goodnight. How's it going? Fine. Laura just called from the hairdresser's. She said she'd be back in about half hour. I'll definitely be done by then. Is that for me? That's for you. Thanks. Ah. The gasket's sealed. It's ready to go. I just have to rotate the tires. You're the best. Get out of here. It's crazy that we don't come out here more often. I know. It looks good. It's so great here. I'll just look upstairs. OK. I'll get it. Hello? Hi, John. Yeah, hold on, I'll get him. Just a minute. It's John. Hey, John. We have a major crisis here. The "Atlantis" puzzle is not in the computer. We've been here all afternoon trying to find it. Oh, come on, John. It's gotta be there. What about the backup disk? There isn't one. We've looked for it. Did you make one? Of course I did! Well, so where is it? I don't know. Well, we're really screwed if this thing doesn't get to Tokyo by the weekend. Look, you're absolutely sure it's not there? I'm positive. We've looked everywhere for it. Look, if I leave right now, I can be there in two hours. Great. I don't have a choice, Laura. God, our future's riding on this proposal. I guess so. Look, if I can't get it sorted out right away, I'm just gonna stay the night and come back in the morning, wake you up. I can't believe there's nobody else that can do this. They've tried. Look, I'm sorry, Laura. - Whatever. - I've gotta get back. I... Whatever. What are you doing here? Well, I was on my way to Las Vegas to visit an old Army buddy for the holiday, and Matt suggested that I make a detour and, uh, stop up here, see your place. He didn't mention it. No? No. Can I come in? Sure. I'm sorry. So how did you get here? Hitchhiked. Uh, so, where's Matt? Um, he had to go back to LA. There was some emergency at the office. I don't know. Oh no. I know. Well, I got a bag full of groceries. I was gonna cook dinner for you guys. Aw. Uh, so when's he gonna be back? Probably not till tomorrow morning. Aw man. Uh... all right, well I, uh, better get on the road 'cause I gotta get a motel near town. Oh, don't... don't be ridiculous. I'm really glad you're here, actually, 'cause it gets kind of spooky being alone and stuff. And we've got a spare room upstairs. So let's go put your bag up there, OK? We built the house when we first got married. Matt sort of did all the plans and the design and everything. It's pretty much his little baby. He furnished it too. Wow. Here we go. So I'll let you get settled in then. OK. I'll be down to cook dinner in an hour. You don't have to do that. I want to. Dinner will be ready in two hours, madame. Oh. Well, how formal should I dress? Whatever you're comfortable in. OK. Let me know if you need anything. We've looked through the indexes of every disk in this building. I called Tokyo and told them that the overnight express might be delayed because weather's been causing problems at the airport. In LA? Well, it buys us a few extra hours. I know it was in here. Great, so I'm going to have to do the whole thing again from memory. You have rough notes or anything? Why would I have a... What is it? This Pro Baseball file. What about it? From my time. When did we do that? Uh... in 1988, '89. It was one of the first games. But why? You sure you didn't transfer the old proposals to the new computers? No. - Oh Christ! - What? I don't understand. - We got these computers in '90. So if you didn't transfer this file... There's no reason why it would even be in this mainframe. This computer does not erase files. Come on. Come on! Powerplay Interactive presents... Oh! Oh jeez. How did it get retitled into Pro Baseball? Just print it out and get it off before any of us die of cardiac arrest. I gotta get out of here. My wife's gonna kill me. You driving back up tonight? Not. I did enough driving today. Matt, did you ask Simon to learn the computers on his spare time? No. Why? Damn! Look, I don't want to make any accusations or anything, but I found Simon on the computer the other day. And maybe I'm wrong, but I thought he was looking at the "Atlantis" file. And then later that night he seemed really concerned about me having seen what he was doing. And why didn't you tell me this three days ago? It's OK. Just go transfer the file, will you? Matt, when you get back, I want you to carefully think about Simon working here. And I'm not talking to you as a friend this time, but as your business partner. Look, John, this could be the spurned woman talk. And, you know, I think she and Simon have been having a thing. Oh, great. Now he's sleeping his way around this office? Look, Matt. If you ever owed him anything, you've paid him in full. He's not the only one you have a debt to. You know? Yeah. Maybe you're right. Holy mother of God. Hello? Is Matt there? He's not here. Is Mrs. Forrest there? Oh god. Matt, I don't know if you're checking your machine. But I finally got Simon Jury's armed service record, and he did get out recently with a dishonorable discharge... after serving 10 years of a 16-year sentence for manslaughter in 1984. The defense tried to argue that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome after his ex-fiancee had been killed in a car bombing in Panama. I called your place in the country, and Simon answered then hung up on me. Look, Officer, I don't know what's happened. That's the whole point. But a crime has been committed! Oh, dammit! Looks like a great bottle. Uh, I was gonna give it to my buddy in Vegas, but, uh, I think we deserve it more. I'll drink to that. To be really honest, though, I bought it a while ago as a thank you present for Matt. But, uh, you told me about him not drinking. What's the matter? Nothing. I just was starting to worry that he was drinking again. What? Look, it's between you and him. It's probably none of my business. No, just tell me. Well, when he came to look for me downtown, we had a couple of beers together. Son of a bitch. Laura, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you. No, he's just been lying to me this whole time. It was just a couple of beers. Yeah, anyway. You're right. Like you said, it's between me and him, right? So let's not let it ruin our dinner. Here's to you. Matt's a lucky man. Stay with me! Come on, stay with me! Stay with me. Go! OK, you'll be all right. You'll be all right. Just sit down here. That was so wonderful. Mm. Thank you. Oh, you don't have to do that. No, I want to. It's great you can cook. It's really delicious. Well, it was more the company than the cooking. Laura. Come on. Come on! Oh! Damn! Shit! I can't do this. I can't. That's all right. Sorry. It's all my fault. I... I won't tell Matt. And I think it's better if you probably leave. Please don't. Come on. Oh, please, come on! Mrs. Forrest. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Who are you? My name is Joe Santapietro. Your husband hired me to help him find Simon Jury. Matt's not here. He's back in LA. Is Mr. Jury... is Mr. Jury staying here? No. He was going to, but he's not here anymore. What's this all about? I think I have some information regarding Mr. Jury that both of you should know. What are you talking about? I don't think he ran into your husband by accident. I think he deliberately sought him out. That's ridiculous! Why would he do that? He didn't even want to take credit for saving Matt's life. Mr. Jury was once involved with the lady that was killed in Matt's car. What? Only a few months later, he went off the deep end and shot two unarmed teenagers through the head. Ugh! I got nothing against you, Laura. But as you know, that son of a bitch you married tried to buy my girlfriend. She died with his blood money in her pocket. He tried to buy me. Now, come on. Give it to me straight. Did he buy you, Laura? No. Stupid. Come here. You know, in another time and place I could've really gone for you, Laura. Laura? Oh my god. Come on, honey. Oh! God! Stay down. Ah! Ah! Whoa! Oh! Ah! Ah! Why are you doing this? Why do you think? Oh, I brought you into my home, into my life. I trusted you! Ah! No! - Laura! Please... Laura! Let her go, Simon! Let her go! Don't do this! No! Oh! Laura! Simon! It's stuck! Push! Hey! Hey, come on! Push now! Come on! Push! No! No! No!
