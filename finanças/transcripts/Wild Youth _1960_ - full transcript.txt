[waves splashing] [upbeat music] [suspenseful music] [dramatic instrumental music] [engine rumbling] [cheering] - Hey guys, for saddles. [chattering and yelling] [thudding] Knock 'em out of that truck, come on! - I got the driver. - Get him! [suspenseful music] - Alex! [smacking] [suspenseful music] [men chattering and yelling] [ominous music] - Sarge! - What are you doing in there? Come on, here, get back to work. [lively music] [bell tolling] [traffic whirring] [dramatic music] [baby crying] [dramatic music] - You bring the money with you? - Have you got the stuff? - Money first. [lively music] - Bueno, bueno. - Wait until I leave. [lively music] [suspenseful music] [operator speaking in foreign language] [ominous music] [light instrumental music] - Thanks. What time do you have? - 12:45, senior. - Gracias. - Gracias, senior. - Oh. - Oh! [crashing] - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. The least I can do is buy you some new ones. - Oh no, really. It was an accident. No, please don't. - There you are. I wouldn't want to have it on my conscience. Besides, you might accuse me of murder. - Thank you. [razor buzzing] - You're late. - Got here as quickly as I could. I had to shop for these. - Oh, a pinata, huh? Smart. [light instrumental music] This will work. - Ernie. You promised. You promised. - Yeah. So did you. [ominous music] - I love you. [romantic music] I should hate you. - Don't ever do that. - You're like a disease, Ernie. Everything you touch, you twist and kill. - But you love me. [dramatic music] - Ernest was never late in his life. When he didn't show on time, I figured something must've happened. - It did. - Well it's a nice clean job. Never lost a drop of blood. Whoever used that knife must have trained in med school. He had it with him, alright. Beautiful white H. That'll loss up a few lives. Chief, we'd better close the border. The killer may still be here. - On a Sunday, senior? That might be a lot of trouble. - Murder usually is. [engines rumbling] - State your citizenship, please. - American. - And you, ma'am? - American. - Did you buy anything in Mexico? - Some toys for the kids. - Turn into number three station down there for secondary customs inspection, please. - Grab hold of your nerves and grab tight. - How long were you in Mexico? - Came over this morning. - Where were you born? - Baltimore. - You, ma'am? Is anything wrong? - Bull fights. Now if it were me getting those horns, she wouldn't mind it a bit. Not one little bit. [chuckling] - Can you tell me where you were born, ma'am? - Philadelphia. - [Officer] May I see your driver's license? - Sure. - Make any purchases? - Just this for my little girl. The bull for my little boy. [phone ringing] - Yes customers, Santa Fe Bridge. - [Agent Maddo] This is Treasury Agent Maddo. Is this Gardener? - Yeah. - Okay, go ahead. [engine revving] - Right, right. Border's now closed until further notice! - Please, friend. I've got a load back there to deliver. - Sorry, the border's closed. - But friend, it took me three days to find him. [cars honking] - [Phone Agent] US Treasury Department, Narcotics Division. - Special Agent Farrell, please. - [Farrell] Farrell speaking. - Farrell, Maddo. Rough news. Corona's got a knife in his back. He's dead and the stuff's gone. - Sounds like a syndicate job. - [Maddo] Well you closed up the border, but we still gonna have any description of the killer. - Henry just brought some new stuff in on Griggs. I'll bring it down. Might be a lead in it. - How soon will you be here? - I'm on my way. Let's go, Henry. - Now listen, Frankie, when we lose that guard, we're gonna make a run for it now, you hear? - Supposing Donna isn't under the bridge. - Oh come on, man. She said she'd make it, didn't she? Back to work, cool it. Talking to Johnny. Probably heard some noise about us, Switch. Hey, what made you swing on Alex? - His aim was too good. - The wetbacks? - They work in the fields just like us. - You know, Frankie- - Would you have cut him? - I think he would've bled. What's important is coming out on top, being number one. How you do it don't matter. - Look, Switch boy, you're in here same as me. - But you're in here because you're stupid. Taking a rap for a beat happy chick. - I was with her. - And too hung up to know the car was hot. Wild... - She just likes kicks. I told you, her stepfather owns a ranch near the panhandle, and my folks work for him. - You want to be a nothing? Be a stinking dirt cropper like your old man? - I don't want to keep sweating in here. - Well you can thank me for putting brains in your skull. - You wouldn't get very far without wheels. - Oh who clued you how to get 'em? - I don't like dragging Donna in on this. - She owes you a favor. - I don't like it. - Well maybe she does. Alright, come on. Well, do you want to be a lousy dirt cropper all the rest of your life? [sirens wailing] [cars honking] - Gracias. Stirred up quite a mess, didn't we? - Well, so far we've seen some dozens sombreros and two bottles of tequila. Look, can't we let this hearse go through? - No, sorry. [engine rumbling] [upbeat music] - Hey Donna. Ah, you're late. I was beginning to think you wouldn't show. - I'm here, that's all that really counts, isn't it, Frankie? [whistling] - Frankie, you sure make it tough on a guy low on vitamins. - Oh I'm sorry. Donna, this is Switch. - Hello. - No greeting? You know...like a brother to sister. - Come on, we gotta get out of here. - You're gonna cause a family feud doing things like that, Frankie. - You bring the clothes? - In the backseat. - Come on, let's go. [upbeat music] [doors slam] How are my folks? - Okay. - Did you have any trouble getting the car? No, it's Bumble's car. He won't miss it. - Who's Bumble? - Handyman. He goes off on drugs. Disappears for days. - Is he gone now? - I got him started. - Yeah, I'll bet you did. You think smart, sis. - Why do they call you Switch? Did they have you in there for using that? - Yes, ma'am, on my father. - Kill him? - Oh no. I just scared him a little. He had to have a lesson. He got too quick with his hand. - Sometimes I feel like sticking my stepfather. - Oh yeah? Why? - When he beats my mother. - Well now if that ever happens again, you just call on old Switch. Be a real pleasure, you hear? I mean, us being brother and sister... You know, blood's thicker than water. - Switch! [slams door] - Now Frankie, you just ain't got no heart for family reunions. - I'll drive. [laughing] [upbeat music] [lively music] [engine rumbling] [engine puttering] - Lousy piece of junk. - Well, what do we do now? - We get rid of it, that's what we do now. - Then what? - Well we've got our thumbs, and we've got Donna. Well come on. [trunk slams] Alright let's push! You got it made, this. [laughing] [siren wailing] Feds. - Looking for us? - Uh uh, I don't- And man, what a chase that'll be. - That's someday, Switch. Today it's now. - Alright, come on, let's go. [siren wailing] - Give me something. I can't make it. - Later. - But I've gotta have it now. - Honey- - You didn't give me that honey stuff before, you was glad I was me. - You were you when I was glad. That was before. It'll be that way again. - Ernie. - You sweat it off til later. - Hey, car. [engine rumbling] Well, business is slow. - Don't worry about it, Frankie. Donna here will help the pickup. You just start your engine and rev it up, honey. The next car that comes along, you hear? - Like this? - Okay, Donna, turn off the ignition. - What do they have at that farm, Frankie? Revival meetings? - Hey, rev it up again, honey. [engine rumbling] Man, if that guy didn't see that, he must be dead. [tires screeching] [suspenseful music] Hey come on. - Let's go! Let's go. - Come on! - Don't pick them up, Ernie. - Be happy we're gonna be a family. Safe travel insurance. You act like a good little girl and I'll give you a nice Mother's Day present later. [ominous music] Hop in, kids. - Thanks, mister. - Be my guests. [ominous music] [cars honking] - Good to see you. How are you, Henry? - Hello Maddo. - Anything yet? - Not yet. - Call the guards. I want 'em to look over some photos. I want you men to take a look at some photos. You see a familiar face, holler. This is Griggs. He's head of the syndicate. We got him wired in Chicago. Might be in the company of Griggs. He's a killer, might be the one we're after. This is Sam. [engine rumbling] [tire popping] [tires screeching] - We'll change the tire for you, mister. - Thanks. - Here, Donna. - Better get out. [metal clinking] So you kids are on your way to Dallas. - Yeah, we just came down for the bull fights. - That's a pretty long hitch. Especially with a girl. - Well, I think we can take care of ourselves. - Sure. - Your parents let you go? - Sure, they're broad minded. They let us do what we like. - Well, we'll take you all the way to Dallas. Hold on. - What about Bumble's car? - Who cares about Bumble? - You know, Donna, this cat is square and a half. [laughing] [ominous music] Listen, honey, you forget about that chicken. You stick with me and we'll have a wild ride, huh? [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [banging] - That's it, mister. [suspenseful music] [cars honking] - That's him. - That's Griggs. - No, not him. The fellow behind him. - You sure? - I remember because he had a woman with him. She was acting kinda sick. He said they'd been at the bull fight. - Are you sure it was these two? - Know them? - I saw the woman. I was waiting for Carreras. She was buying a toy bull and a doll from a street vendor. I bumped into her and broke the doll. I bought her a new one. A new doll. - Open the border. Get out an APB, Henry. Road blocks on all routes out of El Paso. - Right. [cars honking] [engine rumbling] - Do you want us to close the window? - Hey, what's the matter with her, mister? - You better get her to a doctor, mister. She looks bad. - Ernie... - Shut up. - Ernie... - Hey! [smacking] - Hey, what does she want? - A bell, anything. Give it to her, she'll drink it. Sorry you kids had to see that. It's the only way I could stop her. - Can I help? - You'd better let us out, mister. We'll hitch another ride. - What's the matter? - It's our choice. - Hey, are you crazy? - I said I'd take you all the way to Dallas. - We changed our minds. We don't want to go to Dallas. - No? [suspenseful music] - Hey, that was a road block. - Us? - Uh, him. [suspenseful music] Hey, this isn't the way to Dallas. - Shortcut. [suspenseful music] - Alright mister, pull over. - I said I'll take you all the way to Dallas. - Come on, pull it over. - Take it easy. - You're heading in the wrong direction for us. - Ain't got a time. - I said pull over. - You give me no choice. Now what? - We're stepping out. Come on. - Forget about him, let's go. - Go on, punk, show your stuff. It's me or you, and you got the edge. But I don't think you got the guts. [ominous music] - Look, mister. We're in trouble just like you. We just escaped from an honor farm. - Big timers, huh? - No trouble, no trouble at all. We just want to get out. - Go on. Why don't you? - I'm just letting you off. Come on. Come on. - Will you be alright? - I'll be alright, honey. [suspenseful music] - No little piece of dirt pulls a knife on me. [smacking] - Did you see him? He tried to kill me! - Let's get out of here. - Should have sliced him when I had the chance. - He must be the one that federal man was after. - Yeah. - Well come on, let's go. - Wait a minute. [trunk slams] Well that'll cut his water. - Alright come on, let's go! - Wait a minute, wait. - No! - Here's a present for you. - Oh please. Please let me keep the doll. Please. - Well you can have the doll. - Oh, she's flipped. Come on. [ominous music] - Wait! Let me have that. - Hey wait a minute. [suspenseful music] [smacking] She was too big for dolls, anyway. [ominous music] [siren wailing] [dispatcher chattering] [steady music] - Come on. We catch up with those kids, I'll slice 'em up like cheese. [ominous music] - So, two kids broke out of the honor farm. - Oh, it just makes it all the tougher on 'em when they get caught. - Do you think you can catch 'em? - Oh, how far can they get? A couple of kids on foot. That's mighty good coffee, Ed. - It's the same kind you get every day. - Are you insinuating I'm a freeloader? - Well now, I wouldn't say a thing like that. - Of course not. - Oh say, Jim. - Yeah? - When you're heading back this way, would you mind stopping and picking up a new prescription of pills that Ben has ready for me? - Oh sure. I'll see ya. Now don't forget, keep an eye out for those kids. - Sure, I'll catch 'em for you. [laughing] [ominous music] - I gotta rest. - Come on. - I'm tired. - Well come on. - You aren't so tough when it counts. As a matter of fact, in my book, you aren't adding up to anything. - Look, you shut up. - Don't tell me to shut up! I'm not your girl! - I know you're not, your chicken's girl. - Who was chicken in the car? You're awfully brave with girls. Frankie, no, Frankie! [smacking] [grunting] [suspenseful music] - Okay, Switch boy. [smacking] [suspenseful music] Okay Switch. You lost your edge. - Look Frankie, it's no sense in us fighting. We're in a spot. - Yeah. - But you just tell her to keep off my back. - Don't you worry about it. - Alright. Let's go. [dramatic music] - Hey wait a minute. Just to show there's no hard feelings, Donna. [dramatic music] [trunk slams] - Howdy. - Our car is stuck. - What's wrong with it? - Distributor. - What kind of car you driving? - Plymouth Suburban. - And where, the breaker points? - Ah, some kids hitchhiking ripped it out. - Hey, that must be the two kids that escaped from the honor farm. State trooper was just here looking for 'em. - Yeah? - What's the matter, your wife ailing? - She's got the virus. - Well bring her on in here in the office. Put her in here on the couch. - Ooh! - She's sick, she's looking pretty green. - Yeah. - You know it's gonna take me a couple hours to fix that car of yours. - A couple hours? - I don't think that distributor around here will work. - Can't wait. Gotta get her to a doctor. - The only doctor around here is old Doc Travis. He's got a cabin up there by Conscious Lodge about five miles up the road. He ain't home, he's gone fishing. I'll go out to the garage and see if I can put something together and get you rolling. - I love you. I love you, Madge. - I haven't got anything out there to work. I'll have to drive into Housley and pick up a distributor. - I think not. - What do you mean? - I said I think not. - I don't understand. - Give me the keys to the car outside. - My wagon? - Yeah. - You must be kidding. [ominous music] - I only say it once, Mac. - They're hanging out on the wall. The smallest one. [steady ominous music] - You should go on a diet, Mac. Come on. If we're lucky, we'll find these kids up the road. [suspenseful music] [upbeat music] - Cross right here. [water splashing] - Watch your step. - Here I come. Whoa! [water splashing] Frankie! Oh! Oh! Oh, you need a brain wash! - Keep it up, Switchy. You won't have any brains to wash. - Oh, oh... [steady music] - Hey! There's a house up here. Come on, let's go up. - Nobody here. - I wonder how lives here. - Three bears. - Oh very funny. - And let's look around. - Well, I'm hungry. I'm gonna find some food. - Hey Donna, look. I found some clothes for you. - Oh, thank you, Frankie. - Well, no food, nothing. - Would you two boy scouts get some wood for the fire? I'm cold and wet, and I'd like to change. - Come on, Switch, give her a break. [gentle ominous music] [door shuts] [ominous music] [screaming] [upbeat music] [screaming] - Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Let me go! Stop it! [crashing] - Switch! - Frankie! [smacking] - You're about as rotten as they come, Switch. When they made the mold, they threw yours away. - I just may have myself a new mold, Frankie. All platinum. You know what this stuff is? It's horse. - Heroin? - Yes, sirree. Like Fort Knox in your hip pocket. Man, we're in big league. - No wonder she wanted it. - Wanted it? Needed it. That's what was wrong with her, she was on it. She's a junkie. - Well they'll be coming after it. - So, we'll head for the border. Once inside old Mexico, we can make the right connections. - Mexico, that stuff just came from there. Why take it back? - Because down there, it'll be easier to fence wholesale, that's why. - Yeah, and get fenced in. - Uh uh, Frankie. This stuff is open sesame, man. It's gonna introduce us to the right circles. It's gonna make us big. - I don't want it. If this stuff does what it did to that woman, I don't want it. - I thought you wanted a ride. - Not that kind! - Donna's right. - Grade A chicken, small time. - Yeah, and we're gonna stay that way. - Alrighty. If you don't want it, then I'll just do it alone. - Not with this. We're gonna turn it in. - What are you, a happy little Easter bunny, or something? - Just don't plan to make money off of junkies. - Oh come on, Frankie. Now they're gonna get it anyway. We're just doing 'em a favor, that's all. - We'll let somebody else do them favors. - Okay, Frankie. Yeah, I guess you're right. If we got caught with that stuff, it would give us a pretty big stretch now, wouldn't it? - You bet we would. Alright, let's get the fire wood. - Oh, we can't stay here. They'll be coming after us. - Them? They're running from the feds. Now relax. [dispatcher chattering] - Hey Ed! [dispatcher chattering] [ominous music] Ed. Oh no. [dispatcher chattering] - Car one-four. Car one-four to headquarters. - [Dispatcher] Come in, car one-four. - This is Trout. I'm up at Erickson's place. He's dead. Murdered. - 10-4, is that Ed Erickson's at Cedar Hill? - [Ed] Right. - Okay. Just received a 10-5 from PD. There's been a murder at Cedar Hill about five miles back down the road. - That might be a lead for us, thanks. - Yes sir. [engine revving] - [Dispatcher] Seven eight two, Clarence. [siren wailing] [gentle music] - I'm glad we're finally alone. Oh look, Frankie. Aren't they sweet? Come on. Come on. It's trembling. - Well, rabbits are no different than people, sometimes. They get scared. - Like us, Frankie? I'm scared. I've never been so scared in my whole life. - Everything will be alright. - I hope so. It's like we're rolling down a long steep hill with no end to it. No stopping. - We'll stop, Donna. Only we'll stop the right way. - How are we gonna stop, Frankie? - We'll stop. Every ride's got to come to an end, this one included. We'll get off. Hey look, it's not trembling anymore. - It's not scared anymore. [siren wailing] - He was still warm when I got here. I looked around and his car is missing. - Where is he? - Inside. - Let's go. It's the same butcher, alright. [door shuts] - Well, you two have certainly been gone a long time. - Yeah. [ominous music] - Well, one big happy family again. - What are you gonna do? [ominous music] - Now you don't want to have anybody spoiling surprises, do you? [smacking] That isn't even surprise number one, but it'll do for the minute. That's for the rock. - Ernie! It's not in the doll. - Alright, who wants to do the telling? So that's how it is. - Find it, Ernie, find it. - Alright you. Where is it? - Oh please, kid, tell him. - I can't. - Maybe you won't have to wait for your surprise. I can give it to you now. I can give your girlfriend a face that won't go with the rest of her body. [gasping] Be kind of a shame to. They go so well together. Yeah. I get done with you, I make you the number one freak in the side show of the circus. [smacking] [suspenseful music] - Switch, here! - You took the stuff. - That's right, I took it. - Smart. - Maybe smarter than you think. - How about it, kid? Just enough for her. I'll pay you for it. - Somehow you're not getting through to me at all. - So you think you're smart. Well I'll tell you something. I've got a gun I can reach for, and I can blast your guts out. But you're too stupid. How far do you think you'll get? - All the way. - With the feds on the loose, and the local law out looking for you right now? Yeah. Fellow at the service station told me. The rangers spread the word on you. - What are you selling, mister? - Big league, kid. That's what you want, isn't it? - Don't fall for that line, Switch. - Shut up. Yeah. I think you're coming through to me now. - I'm big league. Member of a big syndicate. You won't have to take the long road through the town. I can issue in shortcut. - Yeah, right to the nearest cemetery. - Your friend's got a sense of humor. - What about my cut of the stuff? - You'll get yours, kid. We gotta start out with mutual trust. You see? I wasn't kidding ya. Where is it, kid? - I got it hidden. - Just so they don't lose their good manners. She's a nervous case, don't test her. Let's go. - I'm sorry. You wouldn't understand how it is. You wouldn't understand. - It's you I'm sorry for, lady. [suspenseful music] - Okay, take it easy. [suspenseful music] - Out in one shot. - Like a baby. - And to think I almost went off the deep end for you. - You wanted a wild ride. [dramatic music] - Just as you said, knifing alright. Went into a main artery, clean as a whistle. All the vetting around here was as they figured. [siren wailing] [siren wailing] - Found this in our boy's car. Mean anything to you/ - It means what we're after is in the doll. - The distributor was ripped out of the other car. - Jim and I will start. - Wait a minute. That old Plymouth we found with those honor farm shirts. Those kids could be with them. - Which way would they go, Trout? - North, probably. We didn't pass them and the other way is blocked. Could be they took the old road past Traverson's cabin. - Alright Maddo, you and I will go in the car. Tell 'em to form up a search party. We'll find them if they're in this area. - Right. [dispatcher chattering] - Well how does it feel to be big time, smart boy? - Let 'em go, Ernie, they're just kids. - They're just three pellets in the gas chamber to me. Alright, in. - Oh look, mister, we won't talk, honest we won't. - That's right. You won't talk. In! - Ernie. [slams door] They can't make it any worse for us if they're caught. Give 'em a break. - I got a strange habit. I like living. [ominous music] Use it if any of them make a wrong move. [engine rumbling] [ominous music] - Let's take a look around. - I'll take the inside. [ominous music] [suspenseful music] Hello! Henry. Farrell, they're here alright. - I don't have to ask. - Oh, it's empty. - Now what? - There's only one direction they can go and that's North. [steady ominous music] - Keep 'em covered. [suspenseful music] - Okay kids, beat it. Go on, get out. - Oh thanks. Thanks, lady. - My baby. [gentle music] My little baby. - What is it, lady? - My baby died, I died too. Not even Ernie could kill that pain. Hurry, get out while you still got a chance. [suspenseful music] [cows mooing] [siren wailing] - Stop for those kids. - The man you're looking for took off after Switch. They were heading toward he feed mill. I'm one of the kids that escaped from the honor farm. - Get in. [suspenseful music] [ominous music] All cars, all cars. Converge on the Green Valley feed mills. Switchblade killer spotted, 10-4. Stay with the kids. [weeping] [suspenseful music] [ominous music] [suspenseful music] [wailing] - Alright killer. [gun firing] [suspenseful music] Come on out, killer. - Don't shoot, copper. I'm unarmed. - Come on out! - Okay. [suspenseful music] [gun firing] [thuds] [ominous music] - Why? Why you, Madge? [dramatic music] [dramatic music] [dramatic orchestral music]
