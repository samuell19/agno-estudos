Cheers! Look at him. He's so handsome! My god! - You know him, don't you? - Bro! She's been looking at you. Bet you're her type. Hey, where? Excuse me. You're Yexel, right? I'm right. I should've known! Thank you! Thank you. See? See? There it is! You're leaving us, no doubt! You know how it is! Yexel has a new victim! Cheers! Wait, guys. - Hi. - Hi. - Yexel. - I'm Ginny. I know you. You're popular, aren't you? Not really. You're handsome in person. Thank you. You wanna join our table? Let's drink. Sure. Let's go. Guys, meet Ginny. - Hi, guys. - Hi. Riza, Anne, Andrew, Macky. I'm Ginny, guys. Nice to meet you. Let's sit down. Sure. - Hi, guys. - Hi. Hello! Yexel! Come on! Hello, ma. How are you, son? I'm fine. Have you sent the money? Not yet. I will try later. I have to pay for the rent or Dave and I will be evicted. Your boyfriend still has no work? You know that he always gets picked on at work. It's his fault that he's fussy about work. He always depends on me. But, son… Alright, Ma. I'll send the money later. I'll try. - Thank you. - Bye. Sir Yexel, the rider is on the way to deliver your food. Thank you so much, BBQ Island, for these delicious barbecues. I'll show you. Let's try if the talk of the town is for real. Delicious! Try it with rice. Guys, order while supplies last. Their barbecue is affordable and tasty. What are you waiting for? Order now at BBQ Island. Thank you. Yexel, how's your girl last night? Just fine. She messaged me this morning. You're something! Will you see her again? Obviously not! She's just for a one-night stand. Hardly good in bed. You're gross, guys. Perverts! How does that make me a pervert when it's her who made the first move. Haha! Look at you taking girls for toys. Goodness! Let's listen to Ma'am Anne. Don't be a kill joy, Madam Anne! This one looks cute. You'll see later. Viewers are coming in. Hi, Mira! Love you too. Shoutout to… Cloe, Bessie, and Gladys. Guys, until later. Thank you to our viewers. Thanks for keeping me company while I work out. Your boy, Yexel, signing out! Can I take a photo? Hello? - Hello, bro! - Hello. Bro, thanks again for letting me use your condo. No biggie! Anything for you. Thanks. It's just difficult with my mom and her boyfriend in our condo. He talks a lot. I can't jive with him. I feel you, bro. That's why I asked for a condo unit, so I won't have to bring girls to our house. Why don't you ask your mom to buy you a unit? She offered one already. You refused? It's just... I don't like how it looks. I told her I'll search for a larger and nicer place. Alright, bro. Bye for now. I'll message the brands I have x-deals with. Alright. Bye. Thanks, bro. Guys, my girlfriend, Ella. - Really? - Really? Anne, Andrew, Riza, Yexel. She's really your girlfriend? - Yeah. - We don't believe you. Kiss her. - Five seconds. - No malice. Five seconds. No malice. - You believe me now? - We're good! Take a shot. Let me see that. Ew, Anne! You're a pervert too! Macky! Stop looking at my phone! Such a pervert! Why? What happened? "Madam" Anne is commenting on topless pics of guys. She said, "Shit, daddy!" What's perverted about that? That's harmless. Look at you, girls. It's okay when you comment that way. When we, guys, do that... We're automatically perverts. That's unfair. - Your comments are like that! - Hell, no! - I heard you talking with Riza about boys. - What's the problem? - About the size and performance. - What's it to you? The details! Stop butting in my life. I'll just take a pee. - What the hell! - Sorry! Oh, my god! Sorry! What happened? - Yexel, who's that? - No, it's okay. I'm fine. It's my fault. I wasn't looking. No, no, it's okay. I'll get you a drink. - You want? - Okay. - Seriously? - Come join us. Sit. - What's your order? - Whichever is the bestseller. I'll get a Jack and Coke mix. Thank you. What's your name? Nina. Yexel. Actually, I know who you are. You're popular, right? Not really. Don't make me blush. I haven't seen you here. It's my first time here. Really? Who are you with? I'm alone. Why? I'm supposed to meet someone. But I was stood up. Don't mind that. He wasted such a beautiful girl. Stop flattering me. That's why you have a lot of fans. I'm telling the truth. You're so beautiful. Who are you with? Just my friends. Do they mind you're with me? They don't. Not a problem. We're always here so they're fed up with me. That would be impossible. What made you say that? I always watch your videos. I never get tired of you. Really? Thanks! I'm the one flattered now. Don't be shy. I hope you don't think I'm a crazy fan. I won't think of you that way. You're too beautiful to be one. Stop flattering me again. I'm dead serious. I'm telling the truth. Besides, you're sexy. Thank you. Cheers! Guys, this is… Nina. Say hi to them. - How old are you again? - 22! She told me earlier she's still a virgin. It's for me to find out. Don't take a video. It's just my phone. Why? We might get caught. No one passes by here. Stop recording. You won't believe me! My girl last night was so memorable! That's why you didn't come back to us. Who's that girl? She said her name is Nina. She was so good! One of the best I've ever had! You want to do it again? Of course, I want to! I'll call her later. Probably one, or two more times before I get tired of her. - Bro. - Yes. Let me borrow your condo again. I can't take her home yet. No worries, bro. You know I just use it with my girls. You always tell that even if you don't have someone. What are you talking about?! I was surprised you called me. Why? You have a reputation… That you don't do relationships. Only one-night stands. So does this mean you like me? Nina, you need to leave. Can't I sleep the night? It's hard to go home at this hour. Someone might see you in the morning. So what? You can't sleep here. Go home now. Call me tomorrow? Yeah. It's morning already. I'm sorry, Grandma. Where did you go? At my boyfriend's. You have a new one? I do. Wait. It's time for your Grandma Myra to take her meds. That's your obligation, right? I don't need to remind you. Sorry, Grandma. I won't do it again. You should thank me for taking care of you after your mother took her own life. The two of you are the same both are crazy over men. What? Let's go. Stand up, please. We'll clean up. Ouch. - Come on. - It hurts. Stand up, let's clean up. - Stand up, let's clean up. - That hurts. That hurts. Ouch! Stand up, let's clean up. Let's go now, Grandma. Ouch! What's happening again? Hey! You went home late just to be with your boyfriend! Clean up the place! Yes, I will clean this place. Let's go now, Grandma. - Myra, stand up! - Let's go. Grandma, let's go. Please stand up. Don't touch me! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Stop it! What's going on? You're hurting her! You're hurting your grandmother! Goodness! Don't cry. Sorry. Do that again. It will be the end of you! Stop crying. I'll do it myself. Bro, look. I met her last night. She's sexy! Dianne? - Let me see. - I thought you're still with Nina. - So what? - Yexel is indeed a playboy. So you want me to stick with just one? We need lots of options. Do they know you're seeing both? Seeing both? Neither is my girlfriend. But both are your fuck buddies. Neither has to know. Bro, are you staying at my condo? I hope so. I still can't bring any girl to my place. Okay. Still not in good terms with my mom's boyfriend. Okay, then. Wait. How's your search for a new condo? I still haven't searched for a good one. Do you want us to help you? My aunt is a broker. Never mind. It's hassle. Are you sure? - I'm all good. - Your mom's boyfriend is the hassle here. It's totally fine. I just want to search for myself. I'm particular with the interior. But not with girls. Bastards! I get pretty girls. You always talk like that without giving us the chance. Give us chance to have pretty girls. You're using my condo. Don't reprimand me! - What are you doing here, Nina? - Who's that girl? Who's her, Yexel? I'm asking you! Yexel! Are you cheating on me? What the hell are you saying? You have a girl in your condo! So what? I'm your girlfriend, right? Girlfriend? She's your girlfriend? She's not. What? You said you like me, didn't you? What are you talking about? I did not tell you that! You know very well I don't do girlfriends! I thought I was the only one. I thought I was different. Just leave. That hurts! That hurts! Who was that? Don't mind her. She just thinks we're dating. I believe you're not expecting for a relationship after this. What? No! I have a boyfriend! I'm outside now. Here? Let's follow them. I'm here. Thank you, sir. One cigarette, please. Thanks! - Miss, does Yexel live there? - The popular guy? Fourth floor. Room 401, Ma'am. Miss, I mean. - Cheers! - Cheers! Sis, let's hook up today! Here we go again, Yexel! Target acquired, am I right? - Just let me. I'm single, anyway. - Two girls at once! Two girls at once? One of them has a boyfriend. What a flirt! - How about that girl, Nina? - Who? Nina. You won't believe it. She assumes she's my girlfriend! Seriously? What did you do? I told her I don't do girlfriends. - She's not my girlfriend. - Of course! You have lots of girls. Fuck buddies only. - Bro, bro! - Is that her? Who? What are you doing here? You called me to introduce me to your friends. Hi, guys! I'm Nina! - Hi! - Hi! That's not funny. What are you doing? I didn't call you! I just want to meet your friends. Can't I? You're not my girlfriend! - Why are you like— - Stop it! Why are you like that? Just go! What if your friends look for me? Are you mad? - Whoa! - Whoa! - Oh my god! - Solid! Hi, Mara! Shoutout to Mark! Someone commented and asked me to go topless while working out. Should I do that? Sure, why not? Sorry, guys. Our live will be cut short. I'll make it up to you soon. Bye for now! Nina, what are you doing here? Are you following me? I'm not! I work out here as well. I saw you so I thought of saying hi. Water? Wait up! Are you avoiding me? Yes, because you're here. Why? I'm just working out here. Can we do it together? Hell, no! I'm leaving! Why are you here? Hey, Yexel. Yexel… Who are you looking for? It's okay, Y-Yexel. I don't mind if you live in this place. I would still love you. What are you talking about? Your house is here, right? No! You went to my condo already. But I saw you came here after we had sex. What? You followed me? I did that because… I really like you. Even if you're not rich, I would still love you. Stop it! Can't you understand that I don't like you? It's just sex. You can use my body as long as you want. Just be with me. Only me. Know what? You're seriously crazy. Leave. Yexel… I said leave! Nina, what are you doing here?! Who's that? What are you doing? I should ask you that. Who's that girl? Yexel, what's the problem. Who is she? Hey, I'm his girlfriend! How dare you flirt with my boyfriend! Girlfriend? - Stop this! Stop! - You're hurting me! How could you do this to me? I thought I was enough! What the hell are you talking about?! We're not a couple! You're not my girlfriend! What do you want me to do? Have sex with you? I'm good at that. The hell, Nina! Stop it! I can't understand why you're doing this to me! You're insane! If you won't stop, I'll file for a restraining order. As if you can afford it. Damn you! - Cheers! - Cheers! Sit over there. I'm here. What happened to you? Not in a good mood? What happened? You finished early. It's Nina. She made a scene! What? She knocked on the car and went berserk. What the fuck! Seriously? It's not funny. What did she do? She knocked on the car and argued with the girl I was making out with. The girl I was with got mad! Nina's crazy! Nina is really something! I know, right! Last time, she followed me on the way home. That's crazy, man! Crazy girl! I'll go home now. I'm not in the mood anymore. Take care! She might still be there! See? Karma. Hey, bro. You didn't tell me you're working out here. Hey. What's up with you, bro? Stop that shit, bro. We know the truth. The truth? You've been fooling us, Yexel. Fooling you? Stop pretending. We know now you're poor. You live in the tenement. Where did you get that? Who told you? From my bashers? Someone sent us a photo of you. The group will not deal with you anymore. Damn, Yexel. We never thought you'd just use us. You befriended us because we're rich. What? Me? I just used you? Look who's talking! You gained followers, however little, because of my popularity. You're the ones who keep on joining my videos and inviting my followers to follow you. Who's the user now? Goodness. Bastards! Who's that? Wait! Yexel. Please talk to me. We have nothing to talk about. Talk to me for the last time and you won't see me again. Yexel… Peace offering. It's too early for this. Let's eat. For sure, you're hungry. What do you want to talk about? I want to apologize for everything I did. I can't believe I did those things. Yes, you stalk me, you force yourself as my girlfriend… You probably ratted me out to Macky that I live here. Yes. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. You knew how much I like you. I'm dead serious about watching all of your videos. I watch out for every single post. I watch you when you broadcast live. I thought you're not a crazy fan. Wait. I have coffee. You know what? I'm not like those who go gaga whenever they see you. You outdo them with what you do to me. That's why I'm sorry. I can't forget about what happened between us. You're just so hot. In those two instances we had sex. Wait. I'm getting dizzy. I've decided I won't miss this chance… To be with you. What's happening? You're awake. I've been waiting for you to wake up. Nina, what is this?! I just don't want you to hurt me again. Stop it! I won't hurt you. I promise. Untie me. Then what? You'll cheat on me again? Nina! Untie me now. Stop this! No one will hear you. The music is too loud. Your neighbors won't budge with your loud music. Help! Stop this, Nina. I'm begging you. Stop… Don't you like me? Can't you understand? I don't like you. So just sex. I can give you that. Stop it! Nina! Stop! Stop it now! Why can't you have a hard-on? Why can't you have a hard-on? You don't like me anymore? Fuck, you're crazy! How could I have an erection when you tied me and bit my dick? You're crazy! Stop this now! Go, open your mouth! Swallow this! I'll get angry. Go on. Drink this. What did you put in my mouth? Viagra. You're truly crazy! I like it when you resist! Nina, please… Nina, stop this now! Help me! Help! Nina, stop this now. Yexel, breakfast time. Oh… Why look at me like that? I cooked for you. Don't you like my cooking? Eat this, please. I cooked that for you. When your girlfriend cooks for you, you have to eat it. Otherwise, she'll get mad at you. Do you want her to sulk over you? Answer me. There. Good boy. You listen to me. Is it delicious? It's so delicious. Just like you. You're so good. Right? You're awake now. What did you do to me? Sorry, love… I got carried away by our session. I tightened your hand and hit you hard on your chest. You're dressed up. You're leaving? I am. I need to go home. My grandma is strict. She will look for me. Don't worry. I'll be back after you sleep. Go ahead. Drink it. Good boy. Nina, please. You came home late. Where did you go? At my boyfriend's. You've been seeing him a lot. I reprimanded you already. It's just now that I have a boyfriend again. How about your responsibility here? Go ahead and take care of your grandma. My apologies. Apologies, apologies! But you keep on disobeying me! Shame on you! How dare you! You're a thief! You stole my ring! - I didn't steal anything. - Stop denying it! I know you took it. I saw you steal it! - I didn't steal it! - You stole it! I know you did it! What are these? Sleeping pills? You want to poison me? You will poison me? How dare you! I don't want this anymore! Stop! Stop! Get out of my house! Go ahead! You should have died along with your mother! Get out and never come back! You, thief! Get out! Is that my phone? Look, love. Many are fond of us. They said we're a match. You posted on my account?! How did you open my phone? Facial recognition! I'm your girlfriend, ain't I? Your fans need to know you have one. They'll stop chasing you. What the hell! Delete it. Next day, I'll post this. Cute, right? See?! So nice! Why do you look at me that way? Did I do something wrong? Until when will you lock me up here? Lock you up? Love, is that how you see me? I'm the only one who truly loves you. I was just hurt when you were making out with another girl. Give me time so I recover your trust… Sabel? Who is this? Sabel? I don't know. Why is she messaging you? Why does she want to meet up? I don't know… I had too many flings and one-night stands. How on earth could I remember all of them? Do you text while I sleep? You think I can text like this? Damn you, Yexel! When did you last meet her? Whatever. Shit! You're cheating on me again? You're getting crazy again. Stop calling me crazy. What are you doing? What will you do? Fuck you! Fuck you! Nina! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! Next time you cheat on me, I'll crush your other hand. Fuck you! Fuck you! I'm sorry, love. I got carried away by my anger. You know how jealous I am with so many girls chasing you. Sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry. You're all mine. You're all mine. Sorry… Sorry, love. Nina… There's no need to let me drink that. What do you mean? I realized that I don't need to resist loving you when you're the perfect girl for me. Oh my god. You finally realized I'm the perfect girl for you. All I needed was time with you alone. I finally realized that. - Is that true? - Yes, I'm serious. I like you. This could be love. Come here. Kiss me. Love… You know… It's better if I'm not tied up. Because... How could I make you happy? Right? This time, could you untie me? Don't worry. I'm not leaving. Promise. I can't bear to lose you. It's just that… Sex is hard in this position. Please? Nina… I love you. I'll stay here. Please. Let me repeat it. Your girlfriend tied you and locked you up in your tenement. And your girlfriend raped you. Sir, she's not my girlfriend. She just thinks so. Why would she think that way? I have no idea. We just met in a bar and we had sex twice. After that I called it quits. But she began stalking and harassing me. If it has been so long, why haven't you filed a restraining order? In my field of work, many fans follow me wherever I go. It's difficult to be popular, isn't it? Why are you more concerned as to whether she's my girlfriend or not. Can't you see the fact that I was raped and tortured for days? Here they are. Do you know him? Yes. Can you tell his name? Yexel Santos. Mr. Santos said you drugged him and tied up to his bed for days. You also tortured him and raped him. No. I can't do that. He said you're an obsessed fan who has been stalking him for days. His story is unbelievable. That's not true. The truth is that I'm his girlfriend. He said you just assume so. That's how much you're obsessed. He has always denied me. He's protecting his fans. I am telling the truth. If you want proof, I have one! Sir, that's not true. She took that photo when I was sleeping, when she kidnapped me. Here. Here. She almost crushed my hand with a hammer. Can you explain how Mr. Santos got his hand injury? We had a fight. I admit. I'm always jealous. Somebody texted him and I just wanted to know why that girl texted him. Then? Then... he got mad all of a sudden. He got mad all of a sudden. Screw you! - He hit the wall! - Sir, that's not true. You're a liar! Does he always get mad that way? Yes. Yes. Did he hurt you? So you're the one who hurt your girlfriend. I told you she's not my girlfriend. This girl is crazy! Why do you believe her? Listen to me, I'm the victim here! Miss, do you want to file a case against Mr. Santos? No need. Even if he hurts me, I still love Yexel. I trust he'll come to terms. Are you certain? Yes, I am. I just want to settle with him… All I want is to go home with him. - Believe me, sir. - Let's put it this way. If he hurts you again, don't hesitate to report to us. I'm sorry, love. I had to admit everything. Thank your girlfriend for not filing a report. There's no need for that. We love each other. Sorry for the trouble. Good boy… You're just making it hard for me. Damn you! Sorry. Did I wake you up? I brought you food. I'm sure you're hungry. What are you doing here? How did you get in? You forgot that you gave me the duplicate key? Nina, please. I'm begging you. Stop bothering me. What are you saying? Is that about earlier? Are you still angry at me for telling the truth to the police? Love, I'm sorry. Try reporting to the police again. You know where this will lead us. Keep in mind I'm the woman. People will believe in me, not you. If you leave me again, I would leak your videos. It would be the end of your career. Your friends would be ashamed of you. Let me prepare your food. Damn you! You're hurting me! Do you like it? Do you like it? Is it good? What are you doing? How dare you! Damn you! Yo, it's your boy! Did you hear what Yexel Santos did to his girlfriend? Imagine, it's possible for a person… - Have you heard of the trending news? - …who loves someone to do that. Yexel Santos killed his girlfriend. I can't believe he can do it. I can't believe he can do it. Yexel killed someone? Yexel killed someone? He's a nice guy. We're actually close when we're at the bar. I can't believe the news. This could be a fake news. I just received the news… Yexel Santos slashed the face of his girlfriend. This is so insane. How could a person do this to someone they love? How about you, guys? Can you do that to people you love? Anyway, later, I will broadcast live. Don't forget to follow me. Let's talk about the reason behind all of these. I just woke up and I saw this issue. Yexel killed someone? I don't know. He's a nice kid. He gets along well. How could he do that? Is that his true self? Excuse me, are you the friends of Mr. Santos? His trending photos include those with all of you. Yes, that's true. Yes, we're his friends. We always come together to this bar. What can you say about the issue that he killed his girlfriend? We can't believe he can do that. It's a very difficult time for us as his friends… as his best friends. We've known Yexel for a long time but we never saw any aggressive behavior. It's hard to imagine he can do that to a girl. That could have been me. Why? Did you have a relationship? If you want to know more about my relationship with Yexel, you can follow me on all my socials. Follow me too to know the full story. Thank you so much. We're done? Okay, thank you. Now, move.
