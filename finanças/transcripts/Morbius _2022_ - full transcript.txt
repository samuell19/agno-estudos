Cerro de la Muerte, Costa Rica We shouldn't be here when it gets dark. Set the trap in the mouth of the cave, please. You need a doctor? I am a doctor. Ah, it's impressive, don't you think? Vampire bats weigh almost nothing, but they can down a creature nearly ten times their size. Woah! What did you use on this bay? You volunteering? Ginger. Pay me now... Before the sun goes down. You saw on that bush craft trudging about and we have a deal. Help! Monarchy. Come on. 25 years ago, Greece She agrees to take better care of you there. Everyone's here to help you. Notice. Michael, this is Lucien. Lucien, Michael. Michael knows more about this place than I do. Play nice. - Hello. - Hello, Milo. My name is Lucien. It's the person who you would see before was Milo. No, he was also a new Milo. Before I enlist the other new Milo... I don't even remember the first Milo. How long have you been here? Long as I can remember. - And you're still not cured? - There is no cure. There's something missing from our DNA. Like a piece of a puzzle. And, until they find it... The only way to stay alive is an oil change, three times a day. What would you do, if you can be normal... Just for an hour... I don't think about it. Hey! Hey, look at those pigs! Best not to be outside when school gets out. Like the original Spartans, we are the few against the many. Milo? Milo! Nurse! Lucien! Lucien! With one of these? It took a team of scientists to build that machine and... you fixed it with a ballpoint pen? There's a school for gifted children in New York. I think that I can get them to agree to cover your tuition. And provide private care to help manage your condition. Somewhere you can study, learn, hone your skills. You have a gift, Michael. I don't think I could forgive myself if I saw it go to waste Dear Milo, this isn't goodbye. I'm gonna find a cure for us... So we can be cranky old men someday. Your friend, Michael. P.S. You shouldn't have unfolded this. Now, you'll never get it back together. See you this summer. Goodbye. "Dear Milo" Please, can I have my letter back? - What? - Please, can I have my letter back? - Kid... - Boon. Please... Uh! Please! Please! Stop it, he said! Go on! Shit! Let me have a look. Let me have a look! - Lucien! - Do not steal my letter! Milo! Milo! Stop, stop, stop, stop! - What about Milo? - I'll look after Milo. He needs me. Michael Morbius completed his doctorate by 19. And quickly established himself... as the world's leading authority on blood-borne diseases. His development of artifical blood has saved more lives than penicillin. Michael Morbius, please step forward... To acknowledge the receipt of your prize, from his majesty, the King of Sweden. I can't believe you dissed the King of Sweden. The king and the queen, their loyal subjects... All of Scandinavia, and the entire scientific community. Yeah, but who does that? Well, yeah. We both know, I have issues. But, hey... I kept the program. There you are. - Hey, Dr. Bancroft. - Hey, Anna. - We gonna play? - Oh, I don't think so. See, now that... Dr. Morbius is back. Maybe, you should try losing for a while. See how that feels. I could happen. - Michael? - Uh, yes! - You got a minute? - Of course. New one, for your collection. - Dr. Morbius is in trouble. - I'm in trouble. "I can't accept a price for the by-product of a failed experiment." Lab #1. Front Page: "American scientist rejects Nobel Prize". You know that people actually like writing text-to-Nobel-oids. Basically, the few that are about their investment. It would help if you stook around long enough to catch them. - Oh! - You're pushing yourself too hard. Does our generous benefactor, Milo, know what you're actually doing here? What am I actually doing here? We're mixing human DNA with bat DNA. - I have no idea what... - you're talking about? Does anything ringing a bell? No bells ringing... Okay, maybe this will jog your memory. I wouldn't go there if I were you. That is, uh... - It's a fish tank, like for flying males. - Hmm... Oh, I see... Some friends that got back from Costa Rica. So when were you gonna tell me? More importantly, how did you get my pass code? It's the first six digit of bat backwards is your password for everything. You should change that. You know, you can lose your license for this. I'm not gonna need it much longer, doctor. You, on the other hand, will. You know, there's something called plausible deniability. You should be thanking me. These are the only mammals in Earth that have evolved to feed exclusively on blood. So, in order to drink it... These bats produce a lot of that contains unique anti-coagulants So your theory is, you can successfully splice vampire genes into your DNA... Or allow your body to produce the same anti-coagulants. Yes, there would be a cure. At what cost? The fusion of different species is a legacy we've already carried in our bodies. Viruses insinuating their deplete asset... Onto our honor for hundreds, of thousands, of years. - That's evolution, this is different. - I don't think it is. We have to push the boundaries, take the risks. Without that, there is no science... No medicine. Nobody threw it all. - Procedure complete. Chimera cells stable - Okay. Test subject for cell combination, 117A Come on, come on, come on. Uh, Test Subject 117 has resulted in... failure. I don't want to see you get hurt. I should have died years ago... Martine. Why am I still alive, if not to fix this? Save my best friend, Milo. And everyone else like us. Not like this. Dr. Morbius, it's Anna! Temperature's spiking and her kidneys are shutting down. We have to induce a coma before she has a stroke. - 100 milligrams of propofol, now. - Sure. It's okay. It's okay. We'll patch it up. There we go. There we go. Thank you, nurse. Well, that'll mean she sleeps good. - Michael. - Huh? It worked. Dr. Michael Morbius. There's a disabled man who wants to see the boss. Michael, get over here! As long as I'm disabled, you'll be fine. You're late. I was trying out this new thing called working. Oh, yeah. And who wants millions in words. I don't believe you are. So what's up with the Goon Squad? Oh, I won a hand of cards against some Russian gentlemen. And frankly, they found his luck improbable. There you are. More like, impossible. So, doctor. How is our favorite patient... Still determined to make his short life even shorter. - Yes. - Fair. Fair, you're one to talk. You got a terrible looking stable walk. Says the man wearing... What is that, a quilt? I was sorry. I knew that the moment was dress for humor. Right, I'll see you later. And you, my door is always open. We miss you at Horizon. We could use your mind. - I'll leave you two to your farm house. - Bye, Nicholas. I've some good news. Let's go for a walk. How's my team doing these days? Dr. Bancroft, she is uh... Overqualified, apt performing, brilliant as usual. And a royal pain in my ass, which is keeping me honest for the most part. Why do you ask? Yeah, for reason. Just haven't seen you in... Forever. I wondered if she had something to do with it. Awh, I miss you too. But yes, she has been working with me to save our lives. I could ask her to stop, if you'd like. Put us out of our misery. Just don't do something stupid and go and fall in love. Because, believe you me... There's absolutely no cure for that. Says the guy who knows absolutely nothing about the subject. Not true. I read about it in books, all the time. Books, really? - Yeah! - Wow! Or romantic comedies, the point is. The point is... Love is not on the cards for us, my friend. Listen, if you start quoting The Notebook to me... I am gonna stop and hobble very slowly in the opposite direction. - Throw it! - I'm close by them. I can feel the... The cure. It's finally possible. Seriously? Highly experimental. Ethically questionable. Very, very... Very expensive. - Any eyes coming? - And not exactly legal. Oh, and it has to be done in international waters. You're always expensive. Is it dangerous? Should I be worried? - You want me to lie to you. - That would be nice, yes. Let's walk on the park, on a sunny day. Oh yeah, that bad, eh? Listen... We don't have much time left. This could be our last chance. So what do you say? Do you want me to fight? Yeah. - You with me? - Till the day you die, brother. Till the day you die. You know, those we need... We need the original Spartans way. The few against the many, yeah. International Waters, East Coast Putting another one in the oven. The moment of truth. Procedure complete Chimera cells stable Success, Martine. - We did it. - It's holding together. Tests 2 through 23... Chimera joins. Glad it's strong. - I have lot others who rescind you. - Yeah. You know, the whole near-death thing is very, very chic. I read it in Cosmo. Is a... Is the main... - Cosmo, what? - I don't know. I know this is just what you've always wanted. Could be a glitches of the inn one day, you never know. This better not be my last one. I know this is painful, but you got it. Is... That's it, bingo. One sec, one sec. It's fine. Come on, there you go. - I can't get up. - Yeah. You're alright, right? Be right back. I'm gonna check on the doctor. Alright. Shouldn't be down here. I can be wherever I want, nurse. It's doctor, actually. I figure, you're gonna have to leave. Doctor... Sure, I can see it. But, uh... You're still the help, just like me. Wow... You can tell all that by just looking at me, huh? And here I thought, you were just another jacked-up dumb shit. Get out. Michael? - Michael? - Where is he? Don't have... - Word. - The hell? Everybody down at the lab, now. Roger that. Don't shoot! Michael! Stop! Michael? It's just me. It's just me. Michael, please. Michael, stop! Stop! You're hurting yourself, stop! Stop. Put that fucking... - Move out! - Move it! What the hell is that thing?! Move it! Move it! Oh my god. Move out! Go, go, go! - Shoot it! - Now. Keep your eyes hid. It's up to Level 3. Jason, come in. Jason. Jason? Shit! Oh, Jesus! Where? Dr. Martine... Martine... Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is the OCV Merna. Call letters, 3X5Y. We are 13 nautical miles off the coast of Long Island. Request immediate airlift. Repeat, this is the LCV Merna. Mayday, mayday, mayday. It's up here, to the right. FBI Agent Stroud... Can we have the room please? You heard the man, can we please have the room? If you could uh, start exiting, that'd be fantastic. Well, we haven't had anything this good, since that thing in San Francisco. Uh, eight bodies. Running ID's right now... But apparently they all shop at the same mercenary supply store. Uh, one survivor. A Dr. Martine Bancroft. Can we talk to her? Now, what if she wakes up? Uh... She, uh, fell down and hit her head, apparently. Anything else? - Someone made a mayday call. - A Dr. Bancroft. Nope, it was a male. Didn't identify himself, then wiped all the surveillance footage. And he grew a conscience and jumped overboard? It happens. Oh, and get this. All the bodies that you're looking at... Were nearly drained of their blood. So, what hunts at night and drinks human blood? You're gonna love this. Early this morning, an unmanned cargo ship was discovered... Near the eastern tip of Long Island with multiple bodies on board. Authorities are not making any comment at this time. But there are reports of one survivor... And we have learned from a high-ranking Coast Guard official... That the vessel was flying... a Panamanian flag when it drifted in from international... What's happened? Some kind of accident. How's your pain today? With a 1 to 10? 11? It's alright. Hey, you're gonna be okay. Lab #1... Pharmacy streets. As a result of my procedure, I have an unpowering urge to consume... Blood... Human blood. In certain respects, I've succeeded far beyond anything I could've imagined. For the first time in my entire life, I feel... good? Yesterday, I can barely walk. Today, I don't know what I'm capable of. For a period of time after ingestion, my numbers are off the charts. I have the constitution of Olympic athletes... Increased strength and speed that can only be described as... superhuman. And all of this, from artificial blood. I've become something... different. I feel a kinship with these creatures. They... They would tear anyone else apart, but they welcome me... Like a brother. I've even developed a form of echolocation. Bat-radar, for the uninitiated. My question is... How do I control it? Isolate it? Breathe... And let it go. But unfortunately, this condition is temporary. I've been timing myself. Artificial blood keeps me stable for six hours. But that window... is growing shorter. Artificial blood won't work forever. The only question remains... What if... What if artificial blood becomes ineffective? What happens if I go without? No blue... No red... Nothing. Eventually, my vitals drop precipitously and my illness returns with a vengeance. Soon, I'll face a choice. Drink the red or die. With what happened on that ship, can't ever happen again. Michael, it's me. You in there? Where are you? Michael? Michael?! What are you doing? Michael, it's Milo. What are you doing? You need help. What? Blood. You want the blood in the freezer? Wait! I'm coming, I'm coming. I'm coming. Alright, Michael... Okay, hold on. Here... Here. Michael... You're strong. Michael, you did it. You did it and found a cure to fix... Milo. What?! What? What is it? I made a terrible mistake, Milo. We all make mistakes, don't worry about it. I've never made one like this before. Michael, enough! Just give it to me. I need it. I can't live like this any longer. - Please! - I can't. What do you mean, you can't? I can't. I need this. I've done things, Milo... By killing people. Oh... We, we, we, we... We can make that go away, the ones who are buried... They're Falc's, guns for hire. I can make that go away. - You don't understand. - I do understand! Please. Have I ever denied you anything? Have I ever said no? - Have I always given you the... - I can't control it! Well, so, so... So you get to live and I get to die, is that it? It's a curse. Believe me, brother. Yes. Now, please... I need you to go. It's not safe here. No... No, don't make me go. - No, please Michael, don't... - I said get out! I said get out! Milo... She's a wreck. Mitchell Bigboft? Agent Stroud and Rodriguez. How you feeling, doctor? Look, I'm in the hospital... Eating really crappy Jell-O. This shouldn't take long. You were out on a container ship that washed up off of Long Island. Doctor, there were eight dead bodies inside. We also noticed that their blood was uh... What do you, what do you call it? Exsanguinated, I looked it up. So, um... Sorry for the graphic nature of some of these photos, but um... You're a doctor, so you know what people look like on the inside. These puncture wounds, right there... Those look like fang marks to you? While you were out there conducting a major experiment. Just hoping you can share some light. Yeah, it... Not exactly sanitary, isn't it? I'm having a little bit of a hard time remembering what happened that night. Sure, let's go. You also work at the Horizon Lab, right? With Dr. Michael Morbius. Yes. 'Preciate your time, doctor. Hello? Who's there? Hello? Step back, step back, step back. It's set and dried. It's like all the blood was drained from this body. - Can you hear? - Yep. Dr. Morbius? Agent Stroud. Agent Rodriguez. Can we have a minute? Of course, how can I help you? First, I want to say, thank you. 'Cause your artificial blood... Actually saved my arm in Afghanistan, sir. Well, I'm glad I can be of service. I mean, I must admit, Doc... You don't look anything, like you do on the news. Yeah, you look downright robust. Well, I have good days in bed. Pilates helps. How are you on boats? As you can see... Don't have very good sea legs. Why do you ask? You've been looking for a cure for your condition your whole life, right? I mean, you pretty much tried everything. Crazy experiments... Maybe on a boat? Crazy isn't a term that I would use... Detective. Unorthodox, maybe. But I'd do just about anything to save a life. I'm sure, you can understand that. Anything else, I can help you two with? 25 for a glass. Give me a laudie dream. - Laud, initiate lock down. - Copy that. Doc... Got a couple more questions for you. Yeah, you're coming with us. - Uh, freeze! - Stop him! Huddle! Get back up and meet me up top. Enough. Manhattan Detention Center It's worse than I first thought. At this rate, artificial blood will stop working in a matter of days. 8:13 PM Down from 6 hours to 4 hours 22 minutes. I got a problem. Holy water? - Really? - What? I'm not taking any chances. It's truely blessed. We found this little guy on the container ship. With dozen bodies. This a little hobby of yours, right? You know, eight dead marks on a boat. Really doesn't ruffle up feathers. I'm pretty sure they were guilty of something... And happy to have them off the water. But Nurse Sutton... Single mother with... Twin girls. That's... Something else. Yes, I know. Her name was Kristine. We worked together. Every single day, for seven years. She was a good person. So why'd you do it? I can't answer that. What did you do to yourself, doctor? - Make us understand. - I wish I knew. Okay... Great stuff. Um, really forwarded. - Thank you, uh... - I dropped a bag. - I've something inside that I need. - Bag of artificial blood? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's in evidence, I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry. I'm starting to get hungry. And you don't want to see me when I'm hungry. We're done here. Let's go. Guard! Your lawyer's here. You look terrible. Lawyer, huh? I don't remember you've ever finish A most school. 'Cause I didn't. Sit down. Sit down. I mean, if one of us was going to end up... Bribe honest traitors. I would never have guessed it would be you. And they're charging me with murder. I don't know. Maybe I blacked out. Hey... Brother, listen to me. I don't believe it. You're not capable of that. I know, that all you left tried to do is help people. You don't belong here. This is place is for terrorists, and drug lords, and god knows who. Michael, we need to get you out of here. - In whatever way possible. - Yeah. Maybe, this is where I belong. If I'm in here, then nobody else dies. Listen to me! You are not capable of killing that woman. Hey, your highness. Time's up. Michael... Here's something to keep you going. Guard! You turd. Milo... Milo! Move! Move! Lock the door. He's getting away! Too much! Daily Bugle, please sir. There you go, buddy. You're a friend. - Always figured that guy for a freak. - Oh, yeah? How's that? You know him where? Walk out... What else you need to know? You know, you shouldn't judge someone by an article. Didn't your mother teach you any manners? Take me for example... I mean, you're accomplishing much. Think I'm joking? Mine! Milo! You caught me. See, I knew you could do it. You took the serum, even though I tried to warn you. Woah, woah. What was I gonna do? Lay down and die? - Thank you for a death wish, brother. - I tried to protect you! Protect me, protect me? Protect me from what? - Becoming a monster like me. - I don't think you're a monster. Okay! I killed the nurse. I killed the nurse. I murdered her. You know what it's like for the first time, you had no idea what you're doing. You have no control. Milo, you have to stop. You have to stop. You have to stop denying who you are. It's boring. We can go anywhere, we can do anything. Let's go. Let's have some fun. This isn't you. I know you. Where's the brother that I used to have. How come you say that to me? Look what you've become. Everything I am now is because of you. I looked up to you, my whole life. I'll never leave you. And I will not go back. You cannot make me go back. I won't leave, Michael. - Hey, hey! Hey! - Woah, stop! - I am a monster. - Woo! We've evolved. You're a scientist, Michael. Surely, surely, you understand that. I thought all this is just a mistake. You know, I can fix it. I'll figure out how to reverse it. Artificial blood will keep us stable. - You have no idea. - Yeah. I'm fine, just the way I am. Thank you very much. Hey! Hands up! Up against the wall now! - Officer... - Come on. Anything you say. - You! Don't move! - Where's my first amendment? We have a suspect. I used to say... Live a little. - Hey! - Freeze! All our lives, we've lived with deaths hanging over us. Why?! Why shouldn't they know what it feels like for a change? Michael! Michael! Michael... I'm not gonna fight you, Milo. Now, he's laying out officers in my city, huh? It's unforgivable. - Just keep your eyes on Dr. Bancroft. - Yeah. Ling-ling, order up. Woman in the jeans, where'd she go? Yeah, right. Great. Hey, stranger. Michael? You shouldn't be here. I didn't kill Nurse Sutton... Nor the police. Or any of those people. I know. Milo... He took the serum. He's out there... And I have to stop him. But I need your help. Coffee? - No, thanks. I quit caffeine. - It's decaf. - Not that kind of vampire. - Just checking. I shouldn't have dragged you out here. I'm sorry. You didn't... I wanted to be there. Well, then apology rescind. Guess we're both a little crazy. - How do you feel? - Incredible. I now went from dying my entire life to feeling more alive than ever. Thankfully, our artificial blood keeps me stable... I just have to drink more often. How often? Well, every 4 hours 22 minutes, down from 6. It's losing its effectiveness. The issue is... When it stops working... I'll become like Milo. You won't. Hi. Over there. - Sorry, this one's no good. - Check it again. Keep one for yourself. No, I don't wanna do it. There's plenty more where those came from. Come on, runt. Just get me back to the lab. Michael? Okay, I know that look. You're up to something. What is it? I'm gonna need a couple of thing from the lab, can you do that for me? Yes, I can, but you didn't answer my question. What is it? You're right, I'm up to something. The ink on this new pack is freaking legit, man. It's a good thing we switched the chemicals. The guy's place. Thank you for coming in. Oh, I love this movie. Is this the part where the mysterious guy in the hoodie... comes in and kicks everybody's ass, 'cause I love that part. - Who the hell are you? - It doesn't matter, but... I am going to need your laboratory. You can keep all the money. All your little toys. Just leave the sciency stuff and... a bag of spicy Cheetos. - He wants my lair. - Yeah. You trying to be funny? No, no, no, no, no. Absolutely not. That's their job. And they both keep like... - Matching necklaces... - Time to go. Did you know that there are 27 bones in the human hand? Allow me to introduce the phalanges. - Then, there's the carpals - Oh shit! - Oh, fuck outta here! - And... The pretty, little, stinky pinky. - Who the hell are you, man? - Hey... I am Venom. You can go now. 6 to 8 weeks, a lot of ibuprofen... Will heal up, just fine. Yo. Can I get a tequila, please? Don Julio #42. Do I know you? Me? - You. - No, I don't think so. We've met... - I'm sure of it. - No, I'd remember. That you're pretty. You know what they say... Tequila to remember, whiskey to forget. It's good. Sir. Two tequilas, please. Hey! Yo! The choice is spoken for, bro. So, we clear? Do you know what... I'm gonna do you a favor. - You walk out of here, alright? - Well, that's very kind of you. But I was thinking, you're a complete asshole. Sir? Could I get my friend here, and his friends, a round of whiskies? Hey! Another time. Jerk! Martine... Milo... Sorry, I let myself in. I hope I didn't startle you. It's okay. But if I heard our base funder was coming, I would have planned a nice dinner for us. Actually, I've already eaten. Well, whatever it is that you're eating is doing wonders for your health. I feel great. What can I do for you? Well, it's Michael. I'm worried about him. He's alone out there. And, I think he needs me. I don't know. I think, if I can get to him before the police, so I can help him. You wouldn't happen to know where he is, would you? You two have always been so close. I'm sorry. I don't. Just to be sure, I'm gonna ask you one more time. You don't happen to know where he is, do you, Martine? I wouldn't lie to you, Milo. I don't. Now, if you don't mind, I have work to do. Okay. Well, if you see him... If you hear from him, tell him... We are the few against the many. We'll have to do that dinner another time, Martine. Police! Clear! Clear! Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Empire State University Martine Bancroft, Doctor of Science Cat's gone. Yeah, and she's probably gone along with it. It's time to eat, you little monster. Ah, shit! Michael... Hey! Michael! Look, I'm sorry. You may wanna close that up. How does it feel... When you're on red? Something wakes up inside of me. Something... Prime less. And I just... And it wants to hunt. And it wants to kill. I'm sorry. Hi... Got a scoop. Nice work, doctor. Thank you, doctor. You know, for the bragger could not... I was gonna do a full Dracula on you downstairs. For the record... I find him to be quite the romantic. Just close your eyes. Okay. A little closer. In the end, the male body has 4 pints of blood in him. I mean, how much do you think the doctor can drink? I don't know. When was the last time you had 36 beers? When was the last time you had any beers? CCTV... I'll go grab the footage. I don't want you to have to move or anything. Uh, check this out. Hey, wait a minute. Zoom in. And hold right there. That's not the doctor. It's what these bloodsuckers do, they multiply. Breaking news on the Lower East Side, where three people have been killed. Authorities have confirmed the discovery of... 3 new bodies outside a bar, popular with Wall Street traders. And like the victims before them, they were completely drained of their blood. Earning the killer, the moniker, "Vampire Murderer" The prime suspect, renowned scientist, Dr. Michael Morbius remains at large. - What have you got yourself into? - However... Another source inside the department has told us that... CCTV footage of the murders suggest the killer could be a copycat. Residents are being urged to stay calm after sundown... until the killer or killers are brought to justice. Milo? You discovered my secret. I mean, look at me. I am reborn. I am the resurrection. My god, look what you've done to yourself. What? Do you disapprove? What's the matter, Nicholas? Is daddy crossed? Milo, settle down. No. Come, let's go have a drink together and celebrate with me, please. Just one drink. Milo, you're... You're scaring me. Please, just... Just... Just calm down. What's the matter? It's... I can't, I can't sleep. Milo, I can help you with that. I've been more than a friend to you all this time, Milo. - Oh, yeah? - I'm gonna stay here with you. But there will be no more violence, understand? That doesn't do it for me. Should have known, you always take his side. Oh, tell me your side then, Milo. Michael doesn't accept what he is, Nicholas. I'm gonna make him accept it. - By ruining his good name? - See! There! There you are! Perfect Michael, selfless Michael, Michael the favorite. Oh, don't be childish, Milo! If anyone was declared to being my favorite... - It's you. I devoted my life to you. - Milo... You pitied me before. You did, you pitied me before. You're repulsed by me now. I am repulsed... By what you've done... By what you've... become. Whatever, this thing... is. You're not up to it. There's no shame in what we are. We are the few... Against the many. Tell Michael... You tell him, I'm gonna kill as many as I want. Help... He's only destroyed by a stake through the heart... Made from the wood of the Holy Cross. You don't believe this. No... But after the week that I've had, anything is possible. - What is that? - This is... An antibody... That inhibits ferritin. Induces a massive iron overload instantly with comatosis. Deadly to bats... Fatal to humans. Okay... Who's the second one for? My window's closing, we both know that. By tomorrow, I'll be forced to consume human blood... And I can't do that, I won't do that. So this is your solution, huh? Injecting yourself with poison? I brought this into the world. So I've got to take it out. I need you to go now... It's not safe here, okay? Nicholas, you okay? Michael... I need help. I went to see Milo... Nicholas? Nicholas!? Nicholas! Nicholas? Michael... Come on, we have to get you to a hospital. You have to cast your net. Michael... Michael... Call out for him. - I want him to hear you. - No. Yes... I'm gonna ask you again. Say... Michael... Michael! Michael... Michael... Yeah... Michael! Michael! Milo... You're hurting me. It's okay. Milo! Martine... Martine... Dear... - I'm back. - Cut him out. Michael... Make it mean something. I can help you. I'm sorry. Come on! Drank the reds? Good for you! Just you and me, Michael. Nothing... No one to hold us back. I'll haul you out of it. That's the spirit! Yeah... Woo! Come on, Michael! Come on! You can do better than this! Michael! It's a gift.
