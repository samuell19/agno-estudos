KIDDING AROUND. [LAUGHTER] [SLURPS] NOW I DON'T HIDE THE RAZOR BLADES IN MY MOUTH, OR I DON'T SPIT THEM IN THE CUP WHEN I TAKE A FAKE DRINK. THEY'RE GONE. THEY'RE HERE. THE TECHNICAL TERM IS "IN THE THROAT." NOW, THE LAST AND FINAL BLADE, THE HARDEST ONE OF ALL, AND THEN SOMETHING... SHIT, I CAN'T PICK IT UP. OKAY, THERE IT IS. COME ON, YOU LITTLE BASTARD. IT'S STUCK TO THE TABLE. THERE. NOW WATCH THE LAST BLADE. WHAT'S THE POINT OF ALL THIS. HERE. THIS... THREE FEET OF COTTON THREAD. - WATCH. - [LAUGHTER] I'LL TELL YOU WHEN I'M KIDDING.
