Dancing offshore... along unsullied bays... mirroring silvery rays... The sea... that suddenly turns gray... on a rainy day... The sea... when summer has come... blends the clouds in the sky... with the angels on high... The sea... shepherd of endless blue... THE PHARMACIST The tanker magnate, indicted for an oil-spill off the French coast, was found dead in a quarry outside Paris. 2 elements puzzle investigators: He drowned in a man-made pool of oil, and his nude body suffered the same fate as the birds he's blamed for killing... - Only 3 a day, Mr. Jouvin. - I know. No smoking in here! In a second. My husband got emphysema from tobacco. Put that cigarette out at once! No need... - Got a light? - I don't smoke. Not feeling well? I'll take care of you. It takes a few years to get lung-cancer or emphysema. You're getting the rush treatment! Gotta go, I hate tobacco! Open the window! You stink! Now I can't eat or fart in this car! Wanna make the Book of the Records? Grossest cop alive! You're senile. You live on boiled veggies, like my grandma! Don't talk, just fart! I can do both. You're jealous cause I'm young. I eat burgers, still have baby fat, and rap music relaxes me... You clog your arteries with sugar and fat. They must be like drainpipes. Just clearing 'em! The CEO of a tobacco-company. His lungs got charred. See, smoking's harmful! The Druid symbol for "Blood of the Earth". A dissident faction founded a new, bloodthirsty religion. This was their logo. They made human sacrifices to the Earth, to ensure bountiful harvests. I thought Druids had magic potions, were peace-Ioving, and gathered mistletoe. These Druids weren't peaceful, and immunized themselves to their own poisons. I found it out in a book by Erwan Le Floch, the expert on Brittany history and Celtic lore. Legend says the Devil didn't want them in Hell. Their whole story's in this book. Don't read it at night! Luckily, it's ancient history: Vercingetorix had them all burned in 62 AD. Seems he missed one of them, Mr Le Floch. Don't be afraid, it won't hurt. Here, you're a hero! Erwan! I was passing by. You OK? Excuse me. Need anything else, m'am? - No. What do I owe? - Nothing. You OK? Yes, but it hurt. Can I have another? No, we're going home. Thanks. - How's your ulcer? - Cured, thanks to you. As long as I stay off those. I lied: I wasn't just passing by. I need your help, Yan. The police came to see me. Mind getting us coffee, Catherine? Not at all, sir. They found a man's body, scarred with a Celtic symbol. A mad killer's loose in Paris. He justifies his crimes through our traditions. You're still unwell. We have to stop him. The cops know he's a Breton, they're on his trail. They may shoot him. What he needs is help... Your ulcer needs medication. It's that madman! Screw my ulcer! Why is he a madman? He wants to save the world! - I need some Pevirex. - Got a prescription? At home, I'll bring it tomorrow. I need to see it now. I can't kill myself with an ointment. You need a prescription, dammit! Come, you'll understand... All this is for you, Erwan. A world, with the colors of your childhood! Green forests, blue oceans, red blood to water the soil. My gift to you, for all you gave me over the years. You're insane! I never told you to become a murderer. I'm just a gardener weeding his garden. Come with me, Yan. I know people who can help you. You're going to help me. You taught me everything. You taught me the art of the Druids. We'll do great things together. We'll rip out the hearts of the Earth's enemies. Write our Bible with polluters' blood! Woe to the defilers of the Sacred Garden! Some herb tea? You'll live here, in peace. Your worries are over, Erwan. Forever. To conclude, a frightening statistic: 20 billion transgenic plants were grown this year. Any questions? Isn't corn genetically altered to resist a caterpillar? Right: The corn-borer. If a caterpillar won't eat that corn, why should we? I hear an insect can destroy the corn-borer. Yes, it lays its eggs in the corn borer's, so they can't hatch. It's a more natural method, but it means less money for agri-food giants and genetic-engineers. We should put that insect into the bastards' bellies! It'd kill 'em and get that shit off our plates! It's too brutal a solution. Why brutal? Let's get rid of that scum! Our health comes first! Get them, before they get us! Enough of their crap! Thanks for speaking out! Yan Lazarrec. Francois Barrier. Bye. Call me tomorrow? That meeting was a jerk-off. Your anger rattled them. They were stunned! Ecology's a war. We need soldiers, not blab! Here's my card. We'll meet again. Sure, Yan. Good meeting you. Is she your girlfriend? Yes, why? She sleeps with him. Say what? They make love, she enjoys it. How do you know? We're not pals anymore? Sorry, when I get psychic I should shut up. See you soon, Francois. Call me. You're not on duty? No, I found a replacement. Mathilde'll be glad. She's in the bathroom. What'll you have? How long have we known each other? A year or two... 2 years. We met at the "Erika" oil-spill. A dirty job! Oily beaches made us close. We scraped up that shit, saved a few birds, and became friends. Then the friend sleeps with your girl... Let me explain... Don't blame her, she loves you. It was an accident... Don't get mad... No point... Don't blame her. It was me... Go fish him out of the can! I can explain... What are you doing? "Alice Mortensen, CEO of the Year." Cosmetology Inc. Buys out St. Marie Corp. I'm calling to say: We're all through. But when that jerk dumps you, don't knock at my doorl You there? Yes. He'll dump you soon. The guy's got no balls! You'll be alone! Serves you right! Don't touch that! What? I was talking to the cat. I don't get it, we were doing fine. I never hurt you, never did you wrong. You said you loved me. I loved you. You don't anymore? Yes, I do. Then why's that creep in your bed? I have to go. You got it? We're through. You're dead to me! Was that him? Don't pick up. Hi, please leave a message. Thanks. I'm sorry. I'm lost, I miss you. Pick up. Pick up at once or you'll never hear from me again. Thanks, Mathilde. Bitchl Hello. Hello, sir. You want a massage? No thanks. Just the gym and a sauna. Are you a hotel guest? Please fill out this card. But you tortured animals. You'll be punished! We have clean towels, sir! Your card, sir! Deliver my message of love! ...And 3 makes 10. Francois! Am I intruding? No, good to see you. When my assistant gets back from lunch, we'll go for a drink. You OK? How did you know? What? That she was screwing that jerk? I'll be back in a half-hour. The way they moved. As she walked to the car with him, she was all female. He wasn't your friend: He was a male. We're animals. We lust like dogs and bitches. I never saw a thing. I'm an idiot. I should've shut up. I'm sorry I made you unhappy. Talk to me. I'm here to listen. I saw her to the subway: To go see her mom. We were due to meet in an hour. She said: "I love you, I miss you." I laughed and said: "You can't miss me, I'm right here." She was wearing her cap, a baseball cap that suits her. Close to tears, she said: "I miss you", while I was still there! I had never felt so loved before. Yet she was also screwing that creep! You find her very beautiful? No, but she's cute. Very smart? No. Average. Why? She a good lay? She's just cute, no genius, not a great lay... Why are you suffering? You've been kidnapped by a mediocre person. You're smart, Francois. You're charming, and she's eating you alive. Do you stare at her window from the street? Do you drink evenings, alone at home, and after a sleepless night, want to die at dawn? I'm an idiot, I know. You never been in love? Love's a pile of shit! Never again! Don't drink, that's her doing. She's hurting you. Forget her. I can't. I try, but I can't. I'd like to kill that fucker! Don't blame him. She loves me. She'll come back... It's true: I want to die. No one should make you suffer. She'll pay for it. She'll be punished some day. It's for me. Work's calling. To get paged like that, you must be a doctor, or a reporter, a dope dealer? I'm a cop! See you soon, Yan. Death by a poison causing lockjaw. You'll say "She died laughing." I beat him to it! He beat me to it! That's a good one! I put up with him every day! Thanks for coming so fast, Inspector. Lt. Barrier. Sure it was her towel? She threw it in the basket. He picked it up. I told him we had clean ones. He wasn't a hotel guest? No, he left without filling his card. Without a word. As he left, he looked at me. It was scary. Why? I don't know. He had nice eyes. Nice eyes scare you? His look scared me. Today he was on your street? Yes, I went to get my car. Christine, it's me. I know you're there, pick up. Don't treat me this wayl I saw him on the sidewalk. He scared me. I called you, maybe it was wrong, but after what happened to that woman... Why don't you pick up? What? He's nuts about you, and you don't care? That's private. I was saying: That guy scares me... Describe him. I hardly saw him. He looked away. Did you dump him? Stick to your case! Describe him, or I can't help you! Medium height... Blue eyes... We arrest all medium height, blue-eyed guys, then you can ID him! You having problems? I ask the questions! Come back calmer, or send a partner. Asshole! - Why are you here? - I followed you. Why? Here's why. I hate seeing a friend in pain. I'm not your friend! You're a lovesick cop. I want to help you. You gay or what? Yes, but I'm shacked up with a cuddly Federal marshal. Leave me alone. I need no one. Leave me alone. You wouldn't leave me, if I felt low. She's eating meat! What? She's eating meat! She's a vegetarian, and she's eating meat! She's a vegetarian. Mathilde? Remember me? Sure! What weather! Waiting for a cab? - Where you headed? - St Germain. Get in, I'll drop you at a cab. That's pretty. 18th century, has a secret mechanism. He's not well. I haven't known him long, but I hate to see him down. There's a cab! I'll get out. It's taken. I worried something'd happen to him. Living with a cop's hard. A cheating woman is deadlier than a bullet or a knife. Specially to a guy like him. Let me out, rain's over. Loosen up, I'm not judging you. Shitty weather! Shitty, yes. Press on the bird's wing. What is it? The scent of a very rare flower. Hi, Mr Lazarrec. Hi, Mrs Chaussois. How's your arthritis? Fine. It's doing better than me! You changed doctors? Yes, mine died. He tried to heal himself! This one's no better. He prescribes Cecalvil 500, which is full of toxins, and quinine which you don't need. But he has a good reputation. Heaven help him, if he tries to heal himself! Try this: All natural, much healthier. Doctors don't like you. And I don't like them. It's a new one to me: As if poison was injected in her facial muscles! She'd just dumped her boyfriend. Christine, it's me. I know you're there, please answer. Don't treat me this wayl Looking for someone? Police. We want to see Mr. Massena. What's it about? To ask him some questions. Got a warrant? - Your ID! - What? Show us your ID! I'm the janitor! Janitors got replaced by doorcodes. They're less of a pain than you! I'll open. Your key'll wreck the lock! What is it? Police! Just a few questions. Mr. Massena? Forget it, he's dead drunk. Mr. Massena? - What do you want? - To ask you some questions. Up yours! What is it? Fuckin' drag! You know Christine Ertaud? Why? She's dead, murdered. She's dead? I was there when you called. She's dead... I heard you on her machine. You two had problems. I suffered for weeks. Now she's dead. You seem pleased. Yes... Say that to the DA, he'll lock your ass up! I didn't kill her. I couldn't kill anyone... I felt so low, I went to see a shrink. He said... - He said... - What? "Pretend she's dead!" Did she mention a guy she saw at the hotel? - Guy at the hotel? - She mention him? Got a cigarette? - A smoke, dammit! - I don't smoke. He's a waste of time! I'll meet you at the car. "Pretend she's dead..." You can't understand... You can't understand... You been boozing? Liquor's bad for you! Rots your gut! Trashes your liver, gives you cancer of the colon! It's a no-no for pregnant women! - You pregnant? - Shut up, asshole! Don't yell at me! When you ride me about my shit, I don't flip! Smoke, it'll chill you out. You feel guilty: That girl got killed. Boozing with bums won't help. I want a new partner, you're a drag! Calling all cars. F15 alert in West Paris. 102 Gagarin project, building B. Car 13 to HQ, we'll take it. You nuts, that's not for us! Good exercise, it'll sober you up. Hi, officers, I called you. He's in the basement, whole building's scared. What's he look like? A kid in the building drew this. Wake up, Junior. We got work! No, Junior. That's the trash room. - Shit! - What? Asbestos! All that asbestos, the bastards! You coming? What about building codes! There's a psycho loose, screw asbestos! Move, dammit! Asbestos is worse: Surefire cancer. The tenants here get killed by scum landlords! Shit! Police! Come out, hands up, you won't be harmed! "Come out, hands up, you won't be harmed!" - He fucking with us? - It's all over! I'm stuck between two wackos! What the... - You changed the batteries? - It's yours! It's ours, dipshit! Batteries are dead! "Batteries, batteries!" Where's my lighter? Got any matches? You're the smoker! Don't do it, man! "Don't do it, man!" Tropical blow job, love? Fuck off! - The cops, step on it! - I'm a cop. I got busted twice this week! Shit! What's up my ass? You're a barman, too! Cop and barman. Shit, that burns. - I have gastritis, too. - They left, you can split. You're crying? Beat it, or I'll get mad. A cop who drinks and weeps? Got a head wound, too. Want me to kick you out? Not your style, love. You're as sad as I am. You got slugged, you're drinking, crying... France gave me gastritis and a garter-belt. I'm crying, too. My make-up's running! Want me to call the paddywagon? No need, it's back. OK, kick me out. If they lock me up, I won't need to fix my make-up. An emergency. Keep it and piss off. OK, bye. See you around, love. I know a place where you can forget it all. Nothing dirty there. It's like getting your head washed. You were nice to me, it's my gift to you. A farm I bought in Brittany, for you, for us. You'll see, it's everything you love. Gimme some, or I'll kill her! Class C drugs are down below. Hurry! Where is it? Hurry! Go away! Don't stay here, he'll kill you! Go to your room, Erwan! Run for it! He's mad, he's a murderer! Don't listen to him. Take some and leave. Don't touch it, it's poison! Open the fuckin' door! Go away! Erwan, you need rest. Quite a swig... for a pig! I'm gonna quit the force. Impossible. Why? Once a cop, always a cop. I can't quit being gay. Are you really gay? If you don't know, you're one lousy cop. I'm a good cop! The best! I got a woman killed, I got my partner shot in the gut. Not a good track record. OK, I'm going. Hold this! What are you doing? Help me, dammit. Not easy in a skirt! You crazy? Cocksucker! Fuckin' pig! I'm really hammered. You coming? Why climb that wall in pitch darkness? Then stay all alone. Hear the call of the jungle? They got motorbikes in the jungle? There she is. She's asleep. Maybe I shouldn't wake her up. - What is it? - An antelope. We hit it off right away. I was hiding from the cops, leaning on the fence, when something licked my ear. What am I doing here? I don't get much love. Go get your ear licked, I've had enough. Scram, you meanie! You deserve what you get! I woke you up, poor dear. - Got a subway ticket? - What? It's her favorite food. I got my monthly pass, she'll OD. You never got caught by the guards? Came close a few times. Security's heavy. Say you're hot for an antelope! Very funny! There can't be many wackos here at night. I only saw one: A few days ago, in the vivarium. Where? The vivarium, where they keep bugs and snakes. It's hot and smelly. The guy was handling the black widow. Is that a friend of yours? No, the world's deadliest spider. He was holding it with his bare hands. A real weirdo. I saw his eyes: I'm still spooked. You gotta be crazy to be in a zoo at night? Crazy beautiful! Erwan... Maurice Battistoni's room, please. Who are you? Police. Who's he? - I'm his wife. - Shut up! Sorry, it's 3AM. I can't let you in. He's my partner, he got shot on duty! He's very weak. 5 minutes, no more. Maurice... Can you hear me? It's me, Francois. It was all my fault... I'm a creep. Asbestos! Asbestos! The best adjective for you would be "worthy". Good record, you don't drink, aren't violent, or neurotic, a reliable man. Why were you drunk at 3AM, with a drag queen, in your partner's room, almost killing him in his oxygen tent? I could try to explain. But my only excuse isn't easy to say. Go ahead. I'm ashamed of myself. That doesn't solve my problem. I should fire you, but I don't want to. I'll decide once Maurice can testify. You'll team up with Massoud for now. Avoid booze, drag queens, and hospitals at night! A call for you. It's Patrick. Have you heard from Mathilde? Not a word. She's vanished. What? We had a date: She never came. Some nerve, calling me! I'm really worried. How many were we, 2 years ago? What? On that oil-spill, how many volunteers were we? 200... 300? I'm not kidding, I mean it! Face it! She's dumped you for another volunteer! Francois! What is it? Lycopode powder. A bit like pollen. It's used to handle diamonds, or for dry shampoo. Traces were found at all 3 murder sites. I'm allergic to pollen: This is worse! And a black widow spider was stolen from the zoo. Seems a lot of freaks love dangerous animals. Lycopode powder was in the spider's tank. That drag queen I met... That's your private life... I only know his first name: Tony. Dunno where he lives... We gotta find him: He's in danger. Good evening. I brought supplies. I hardly saw him and I can't draw. But he saw you. Try harder! It was dark, and I'm kinda dark, so I'm not too worried. - What's that? - You, when he finds you. He was like an obeah man. - A what? - A West Indian sorcerer. They talk to the dead. Was he black, too? No. He had light skin, blue eyes, I think, but the gaze of a sorcerer. Freezes the blood in your veins! - What's your first name? - Why? I'm falling in love. Don't joke. He's looking for you! You'd be sad if I died? A rose for the lady? No thanks, she's a guy. I want the reddest one. From my heart, it was yours from the start! - Wanna get punched? - Yes! So he's a witch doctor with white skin and blue eyes. What else? I love you. If you were more conventional... You'd be bored. Come early tomorrow, we'll do his identikit. Early? I work at night, love. Call me when you wake up. Don't leave home! Get it? Stay put, I'll pick you up. Sorry, I'm a bit run down. Had a rough night. Great to see you, even run down. That idiot called me. - Patrick? - Now she's dumped him. Bitch hasn't called him in 2 days. Guy who rid you of her deserves a medal. I can't believe you're a cop. Me, too. I'm the worst cop alive. I'm a menace, to my partners. I just put one in the hospital. With me, only criminals are safe. I'm tracking a serial killer. He commits crimes, then I commit fuck-ups. A serial killer? Let's drop it, I'll spoil your lunch. Why'd you join the force? Why? Dunno. I was an idiot, I was young. I hoped it'd be like American movies, but it's like French TV! I was really dumb. I got sick of playing cops 'n robbers. I realized there was a more vital fight, that you and I are fighting. Good man! No one else thinks so. Got any plans lined up? None. Guess I qualify for supermarket guard. Poor supermarket! I can make you a better offer. Sweetie, your line's always busy. Never call me again, asshole! Now it's free! I'm in danger, stuck at home, and out of food. - Croissants? - That's be sweet. - I'll bring some. - Thanks. Hello? Tell me... That slut? That's what she is! Don't forget me! Keep talking, you're a riot! I hate what I do, too. I'm like a prescription grocer! I'm selling the store. I've bought a fabulous farm in Brittany. I'll make it a showplace for the world. I'll need help, Francois. Excuse me. Everything OK? I'll pick you up in an hour. Let no one in! What's your address? See you soon. Back to cops 'n robbers? The last time: To protect a witness. - From that killer? - Yes. Tell me about your farm... Martine? Yes, it's me. Yes, it's me. I'm here to satisfy your innermost desires. Tony? Your decision's final? One of my informers got killed. I promised to protect him, he trusted me. Now he's in the morgue. You may exonerate me. But I can't. Got any plans? Someone's helping me turn my life around. Hi there, bozos! Big daddy's home! - Your wound better? - AOK! I heal fast. All the nurses wanted to see it, so I let' em see it all! Partners again! - No, I'm calling it quits. - What? - I resigned. - You did? You're nuts! A great cop like you! You'll find a better partner. Sure, but that's not the problem. Without you, farting in the car's no fun! And I'll miss getting shot at! I'll miss you. But I've got a better deal. The killer! Filmed by his victim! Not coming? I've lost interest. - Hello, sir. - Your boss in? - He's away for the weekend. - In Brittany? At his farm. He'll call. Any message? It's me, any problems? No, everything's fine. Have a nice weekend. Thanks, sir. Same to you. Don't touch anything! He has doctorates in biology and pharmacology, his teachers say he was a gifted Ioner. He went into research, then dropped it all, and vanished. - For 2 years. - What did he do? Nothing. Went back to nature in central France. The local farmers saw him as a beast, and shunned him. He looks so cute there! Then 3 hunters were found brutally slain. He was the prime suspect, but it wasn't proven. You sure can pick 'em! You're crazy! Stop that, Barrier! Shut up! Quit it, shit! - We far from his farm? - A half-hour. He's in there. The sharpshooters are positioned, we move in at dusk. Lt. Barrier knows him. He wants us to hold back. Let him go in alone. That's insane! He's more useful to us alive than dead. I was waiting for you. They're in the yard. Doing what? Hugging. I'll give you the tour later. I've got 500 acres. I can buy lots more for a song. They say the land's barren. We'll see about that! There, I'll give you tons of wheat, natural wheat, like in primeval timesl There, cattle will graze on healthy grass. The orchard and kitchen-garden go there, we'll have tasty fruit and vegetables. I'm so glad you came. Pity it's overcast. At the magic hour, it's so beautiful in the sun. There's no sun now, I can't miss him! They're headed for the farm. I can pop him. Don't! White wine or rose? I'd go for white. No, just water. Asshole! He's with a killer. Not partying! He could die, spare us your comments! Want some salami? You look tired. I've seen better days. What are you afraid of? Afraid? I'm not afraid of anything! Fear isn't like fatigue. The rings around the eyes are paler, the eyes can hardly focus... What do you fear? Everything! That I wasted my life, that I made a bad choice. I left Paris and my job for a farm in the middle of nowhere... Wouldn't that scare you? Relax, this is better than Paris. You don't like your room? It's fine. You can have mine, The sun'll wake you. No, this is great. I know what you miss: The friendly decor of Police HQ, BO, second-hand smoke, phones ringing off the hook. Talk about paradise lost! Cut the crap! Tell me something... Why didn't you call? I'd have met you. Where's your luggage? Shit! I left on impulse, Yan. My partner and I drove past the train station. I said: "Stop, I'll be back in 5 minutes." I jumped on a train, started a new life... - Will he buy that? - Why did we let him try? All units, full alert! Tomorrow we get you toothbrush and razor... Could be Spanish, right? Isn't it like gypsy music? That's Arab! Now it's North African... Well? Where's it from? Nobody ever guesses. I have no idea. From Brittany! Unbelievable, huh? It's so rich in... I smell tobacco! What? I smell tobacco, no one smokes here. And there's just us. Put that out, dammit! No, it's me! My partner smokes all day in the car. My clothes reek of it. You're the best friend I could ever have. I've found out something amazing, all the more since I'm an ex-cop, I've found out one could love, tenderly, from the bottom of one's heart, that one could love a murderer. He's crazy! I can pick him off. I said I want him alive! I'm not a murderer, Francois. I just want to tidy things up. I've started, I'm glad you've come to help me. I'll have a drop of white. I knew you knew. Glad you told me. Or I'd have sacrificed you like the others. I'll forget the slur, and remember you like me. For a while I tried to do without it. I mean friendship. I was wrong, we all need friends. The rest is irrelevant. For instance: A moment ago I had a vision. I saw a guy run through the trees with a rifle. But I thought, I'm here with Francois, nothing else matters. Silly, huh? Would you come with men who'd harm your friend? Would you? Are you cold? You look frozen. Don't move. Be discreet, dammit! Why? He knows we're here. Smoke another, makes no difference. They're playing a strange game. Your man's not up to par. Where's he gone? I'm worried. Talking to yourself? No... To your vision. The guy you saw with a rifle, I told him to leave us alone. That we need no one else. Right, we need no one. We hardly know each other. You a bachelor? Married? I live alone. Always did? I mean, was there ever a woman in your life? Never. The only woman I loved was my mother. Her name was Violet, a wonderful woman. I can imagine. You never found another like her, so you lived alone. I can understand. Her name wasn't Violet. You're as bad a shrink as a cop. I can spot you a mile away! Trying to make me say I hate women? That I lived alone to avoid those bitches? You have a naive view of serial killers. Sorry, Francois, I love women. And they seem fond of me. I'm very normal. You've killed 3 women in a few days! He's provoking him! Gonna move in when he's dead? I nourished the earth with polluters' bloodl Don't talk to me that wayl I got rid of a tanker-owner, a tobacco king, a woman who tortured animals, was I wrong? You said ecology was war! We needed soldiers, not blab! I'm not a murderer. I'm not abnormal. I'm a servant... A servant of... A servant of... Don't talk to me that way. I chose to love you, don't make me suffer. I need your help. Did you kill Mathilde? Did you kill Mathilde? Of course. I helped you. She made you suffer. I did what I had to. Now you're hurting me. I didn't expect thanks, but... Why hurt me? It's over, Yan. I won't bother you anymore. I promise you. We'll go pick up your things Monday. With the north wind, it draws badly. But the north wind does wonders for the sky. Come see. It's clearer, purer than the Mediterranean. In the summer, we'll sit outside and watch the sunset. We'll drink homemade wine. You'll be glad you came. We're surrounded by cops. You know it. They'll move in any moment, I don't want them to kill you. One day, I found a stork in the yard. It had a broken paw and I healed it. This place isn't on their route. It came to tell me I'd found heaven on earth. You must come with me, Yan. So they can't harm you, I'll take care of you. I'm not sick. I don't want my brain probed in a hospital. Don't let them do it. I've got so much to give the world. They'll sedate me. But I must stay awake, remain alert, to prevent the disaster. Don't let them do it. You won't go to a hospital. I knew you wouldn't let me down, I knew I was right to love you. I've never felt so good, Francois. Surrender, you won't be harmedl I know what to expect, they'll stick electrodes in my brain, kill my soul with neuroleptics, I'll become a zombie. You can't wish me that. Go on, help me. Go on... I never felt so good.
