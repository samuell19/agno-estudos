Hi, do you have a swipe? hi, do you have a swipe? I was standing in a doorway the other night just waiting for time to pass and I was so cold, I can remember being so cold. You know, at my age you're never cold, 'cause you're always having fucking hot flashes and I was so cold and I just wanted to be warm, I just wanted to be, you know what I wanted? I wanted someone to take care of me, I just wanted someone to take care of me. - I like your outfit, Mommy. - Oh, thank you. It's like a beautiful rainbow, that came to wash away all the rain. - Yeah. - Aren't you cold? Yeah. Yeah, no, no, I just. I'm sorry, do you have a phone? I just need to make a phone call, is that okay? Yeah? Thank you, thank you so much. You hungry? Come, come. Thank you. And say your name now, come on. Come on, sweetie. - No. - No, no, don't worry. It's cold outside, I know, it's really cold. Don't worry about it, baby, don't worry about it. Okay, you'll be okay. I'll make you something to eat, okay. Put on serial, you can watch whatever you want. Don't worry. - Something to help you? - Si, here. Cut up these cucumbers for me. What's your name? My name is Aurora, Aurora. - Aurora? - Yes, like the borealis, the lights that come up before the sun. Yeah, that's beautiful, that's so beautiful. That's my name, what's your name, where are you from? Yasmine, but people call me Yas. - Yas? - Yas, yeah. Yas, like the music, I love jazz. - Yeah. - I love Yas. You remind me of my daughter. - No, uh-uh. - Yes. She's a beautiful dancer, she's like you, skinny assy, the same color eyes. No. - But she dance. - She doesn't have, no. No, don't worry about that, that gets better. You have beautiful eyes, don't worry, you have beautiful eyes. You know, onion makes your eyes cry, - so this is a little secret. - Okay. If you put on the flame, everything goes to the flame and you don't cry, watch. See, you're not crying, right. - No. - Neither am I. You know, my Mom used to make the best rice. - Really? - Yeah, she would make this rice with coconut. Oh, that's what I use, I use coconut too. - You use coconut? - Yes. And it's like candy, it's like so good. So good, I know, so good. Now, you smell the coconut, be careful with your hair. - Thank you. - Be careful. Today it's a church, but back then it was called - the Park Palace. - Where was it? On 110th and 5th Avenue right around here, - three blocks down. - Yeah? Yeah, a few blocks from where I met you and there all the artists used to go there, Tito Puente, everybody went there, it wasn't called salsa then, it was called Latin music. Okay. And everybody knew how to Latin, especially in Harlem, all the guys knew how to Latin. In the '70s a big thing happened, there was birth control, so that was like if there was a cage and they let the cage open and they let all the women out. So now we could dress however we wanted and we had all these freedoms, you know, it was sex, drugs and rock and roll, but in our world, it was sex, drugs and salsa. Women wanted to come on their own, you know, especially white women, so they were burning their bras and they were saying that women should have equality. But they didn't know what it was like to walk across 110th Street, they didn't know what it was like to be in a club with a bunch of men, where they ruled, they bought the drinks, we had to sit there and look pretty and dance and they didn't know what our reality was like, but then we had another time of freedom, we had a freedom in our culture, we had a freedom in our dance, we had a freedom in our music. Only in this country do they seperate people and music like they do with TV dinners, I never seen such a thing like TV dinners, you put the bread here and the rice here and we don't eat like that, look at how we eat, we put everything on one plate. Did you ever get married? Oh yes, I was married, yes, I was married, but my husband is not around anymore, mu husband died, so it was rough back here, back then it was very rough, there were many street fights and gunfights and he was shot once, so and I loved him so much, but what are you gonna do? You gotta keep going, so we kept going and I raised my little girl, she's in Puerto Rico and we're okay. Eat, eat, eat, eat, now you're gonna be okay, yes? Yeah. I remember when my children were little, after we would eat, I would take the furniture and I'd put it up against the walls here by the kitchen and open up the space and we would dance and sing and play records all day long. Dinah Washington. What a voice. Let's see. Yes, did you ever see a little record like this before? You never saw these, right? Look. Okay. There it is. Come. Come, come, come.

I mean, does it motivate you to change? - I don't know what... - Francis. Change what? Guys, I think I'd like to try this just one on one with Yas.

I don't know, I didn't give it to myself, my Mom gave it to me. Alright, so what I want you to do is to close your eyes, close your eyes, wait, they're open, close 'em and hold 'em. Breathe in. Exhale, okay, I want you to forget about everything. Imagine you're in a really nice place, better than nice, maybe it's a beach with white sands and blue skies, you can feel the sand between your toes. Off in the distance, you hear the sound of laughter, loving, gentle laughter. Who is it? Okay. Just focus, focus and relax. It's a familiar voice. The laughter stops and a familiar voice whispers in your ear. Who is that voice? It's okay. It's okay. It's Mom. It's your Mom? What does she say? She's smiling at you and she is so beautiful, beautiful like you. Now what's she wearing? Look closely. She wants you to see her. She's wearing... Yep? She's wearing like a red, like a red dress and she's got like flowers on it and this ring with this little diamond on the setting and then this other ring on this hand. Stare into her eyes. Mother and daughter, you're together in your place. Do you feel it, are you there? Yeah. Now tell me, where is that place? It was like Christmas Eve and we had to go to the church and I fucking hated that, but then when we were there, she was like crying during the service and I felt so stupid. Try to look me in the eyes, when you talk about this, 'cause these stories, you wanna tell people, you know, these are in you and when you can look someone in the eyes and tell them, it helps so much. - Okay. - You know? So what happened at the church? There was just, it was just Christmas Eve and that's all, she just wanted me to go and I didn't, but I was being mean to her and then when we got there, she was so happy and she was crying during the service and I felt so bad. What would she, what would you guys talk about, what would she say at that church? She just would say that, you know, she loved me. And what would you say to her? Right now? Yeah, what would you say to your Mom right now? I just really miss you. I really miss you, that's all. I love you, you know, it was really fucked up, it was really fucked up. So what would your Mom say to you right now, if she could hear you say that? She'd say I'm sorry too, it sucks. She didn't wanna go. Would she want you to come to wherever she is? Yeah, yeah. I don't know where she. When was the last time you saw your Mom? I was 16 and we were at home and then they came and they told her she had to leave, because she missed an appointment at the center, she missed her appointment. What kind of center was that? Immigration. And what were you doing, when they took her? I was hid... You were hot - or you were high? - I was hiding. Would they have taken you too? I don't know. Sometimes I think maybe I should've gone with her. I don't know. I don't even know where she was taken to. I just, I just really miss her, that's all and I'm figuring it out, it's okay, I got this. Listen, what happened to you is not your fault and no matter what you think, we're here for you and my staff will do everything we can to help you find your mother, but it's gonna take a lot of time and a lot of hard work. No, I don't have any time, I don't have any time, I have been waiting since I was 16, okay and I have been out here all by myself doing it alone and every time there has been a helping hand, it's had a razor blade in it. Listen, I understand, trust me, I do. No, no. How many years have you been alone? Where's your mother? Do you even have a plan? What, march into the blizzard and hope for the best? If you leave now, you're gonna be on your own and there's nothing we can do to help you. But if you stay, there's an open bed, okay? Fuck! Fuck! Shit. Oh, my God, yes! Oh, shit. It's your place now.
