Gone! Joon could be nice in other areas. But when it comes to girls, he is an asshole. His nickname is even "a month and a half." Joon could be nice in other areas. But when it comes to girls, he is an asshole. His nickname is even "a month and a half." He never dates anyone longer than a month and a half. He has so many nicknames. Anyway, be careful. Never fall for him. Never. It's Sun Ho. Hi. Is something wrong? No... Everyone is acting strangely. I have a feeling. It's going to last a month. I think it's going to go for two months. No, no.

You have to see her face at least. Joon. Don't worry. Mr. Suh In Ha. Yes. Please come in. Yeah. You always knew everything. And you always made the face that you couldn't really help it. I forgot. Hye Jung. Couldn't you just leave him for us? I'm sorry. I don't think I can leave him. So... How dare you... Sorry, Hye Jung. Let go. Let go! Let go, Joon. Let's go. Let go of me! I'm on my way to the garden as a favor for my mom. Did everything work out? Are you ok? I still can't reach you. I'm worried now. Call me back. He said that he will call me back. Why isn't he calling? I'm not getting dumped already am I? He is the type that would do it. I'm going. Joon. Spend the night here. Don't leave me alone. Please get me the pills. I'm going to sleep after taking them. Don't give her any. Stop taking them. Don't take them, Mom. You're going to dump me huh? You think girls are that easy? Are girls your accessories? Am I really getting dumped? Asshole. I knew you would do this. You don't have one bit of honesty in your heart. Did something happen to him? I'm not uncomfortable because of you anymore. Also... I really want to stay here. I knew this would have happened. Where is he? Who is it? Guess. Guess who? Why didn't you answer the phone? I was so worried. That's why I came all the way here. I knew that you would be worried. Is something wrong? Just because I gave you a ring, you can't keep on touching me like this. What? I want it to be just us two. No! I didn't even lock the door. No one's home? No! Why not? Isn't it better then? All the more reason that we can't! Why not? No! Hey! You did it on purpose huh? So that I can't go home! Hey! Is this really all you have? Are you laughing? Fine! Keep laughing. It's only going to be for a short while. Just bear with it. Who says it's going to be a short while? Huh? I'm not going home today. What are you... No way. It's not like we dated that long. What are you talking about? I was being considerate, because you might be scared being home alone. Oh I see. What's this? That's Mom's room. It's my mom's room. Is it this way? Why are you trying to go in my room? Huh? What's that? Over there! Where? You're so gullible. You were so ugly! What are you doing? Hey, look here. Hey, come here. Now. Look here, 1, 2. I don't even need to try to take good pictures. Whatever. It's kind of strange. To think that you slept here and studied in this room. I didn't really study. What happened today? Why did you run out like that? Family matters. I was a bit depressed. My family is complicated. That's why I don't believe in love. Because I was so sick of my father's first love. But when I met you, I had this feeling for the first time. Is your heart pounding right now? What? What are you going to do now? You've completely fallen for me. Stop teasing me. What? I waited for a day like this. Don't go home tonight. Umm... It's... You can't back out after starting it first. You were kidding around. So I was kidding too. You talk too much. I'm not going home tonight. Ha Na. What? What? Mom! Hey! You said that your mom isn't coming home tonight. Are you in your room? Mom! Mom, don't come in. I will go out. Ok. I'm going to change. - Let's go. - What? I might as well as say hi. Looking like that? Oh... Your clothes. Hold on. Why did you come home so early? I thought you were staying at the hospital today? Shoes. I thought it was going to be ok to move that tree tomorrow. But I still have to take a look at it. Sorry that I asked you to come all the way here for nothing. It was a good reason to come back home once in a while. Is the professor ok? Yeah. You must have been scared. I'm ok. Mom, you look tired. You should rest a bit. Go to bed early. Rest well! Ok? Now? Hey! My shoes! Ha Na! Did you eat dinner? Yeah! I ate. Bye! Don't be late. Why are you looking out the window? There are so many stars today. Really? I heard that it was going to be cloudy today. Let me see. Mom. Would you like a cup of tea? Why do I keep on seeing you near Ha Na? As far as I know, you're not just a class senior that Ha Na thinks you are. You have secrets. And you have a fiancee. I heard a bit about you too. Did you have a background check on me? I don't think you're someone who is trustworthy. I can't let you have Ha Na. More importantly, I don't think I can let you. I realized how important she was to me. I'm going to call the engagement off. And from now on, it's not going to be easy like this. That's why you're losing her. You didn't take any action up until now. I know best what a nice person Ha Na is. I know how she has an honest and warm heart. So I'm not going to let her go. -Ha Na... I... -Sorry, Mom. What is it? What were you going to say? You first. Ha Na. I've decided to see Professor Suh again. Really? You have my approval. You really do. I've been seeing Professor Suh again. Although I was happy, I always felt discomfort in my heart. It happened a long time ago. I wanted to keep it just for myself. I didn't like how it kept on coming out in my life. When I found out that you had such memories, I was actually thankful towards Professor Suh. You had such a lonely life. I thought that it was great that you had such memories at least. Thank you! But after the accident today, I realized that it's not just in the past. That's why I'm starting all over again. Yes, I like it. You have my approval. What were you going to say? I... Mom... I think I like someone. Tae Sung? Not him. It's not like that. It just happened so quickly without time for me to even think about it. I like him. Why are you still here? I thought you left. I wanted to see your face one more time. What about your mom? I told her. She told me to bring you home next time. I don't know what's wrong with me these days. I feel like a completely different person when I'm with you. Look at me. I like you. So stay by my side. Don't get lost. Bye. Let me hug you. It's nice. Let go! Let go! Let go! Move! Move! Go away! Go away! What are you doing? Call Joon! Bring Joon here. What are you guys doing? Who's drunk? Joon! I tried to stop her, but she drank way too much. Mom! Joon. Call your father. I can't leave like this. You call him! He will listen to you. Mom, take this. What is this? I'm going to leave it in the cafe that I'm working in. Are you staying alone in that building? Of... Of course! I'm so scared all alone by myself. I'm going to get a new place soon. I'm moving next week. Don't worry. Of course, I'm worried. What are you worried about? How can I not be scared when a girl is staying by herself? Heart! Heart! Answer it. Ok. I'm home too. I got home in the morning. I couldn't sleep without you. See you later. I miss you so much. What? Who is it? Is it him? No. It's not him! We're not that close. Let's go. Please come in. I was here yesterday, but I couldn't see you. I see. Did you see her? Father. I am sorry. For what? It's all my fault. I've been a jerk to you. Joon. I knew that Mom was wrong. And I always understood you. But... My heart couldn't forgive you. I felt sorry for Mom, who was always looking at you. Not because of you, but because of Mom, I was hurt. I'm sorry Father. But please come back to Mom one more time. I can't just let Mom's life get ruined like that. Just... Just give up one more time. Please. For Mom and for me. I'm sorry that I gave you such a hard time, Joon. If I could give up, I would have given up a long time ago. Really... I just couldn't do it. It's all my fault. I'm sorry. Does he want to say that it's love? Ha Na! Mom! - It's raining hard isn't it? - Yeah. Why are you standing outside? He told me to wait out here. Yeah? We could have gone to him. - Will he like it? - Did you make it? Yeah. Professor! This is for you. I made it myself. Are you ok? When are you taking this off? I don't want him to shoot guns. I want him to shoot photos. Stand-by. Come here. Just like that. Let's have you look that way. I was about to go home. You came! Eat dinner before you go. What is this? Weren't you going to eat with Joon? No! You should eat with us! I bought a lot of beer. Oh... Joon doesn't like beer. Really? He can only drink wine or one or two shots of Soju. He doesn't drink much. I see. See? You were going to eat with Joon. Ok. I will help you then. Are you good at cooking? I like cooking. I like cooking too. We have a lot in common don't you think? Because we're "drinking buddies!" What did you want to make? Your dream is to make a garden in the Himalayas? Why are you laughing? It's just like dream. My dream is also to open a small hospital in the Himalayas. With a bakery. A bakery? Wow! We have this in common too. We will be neighbors again then. Joon wouldn't approve will he? We're not like that. It looks like it's almost finished. I will get going then. You can't leave. You have to eat with us. I bet Joon wants to just eat with you. I'll see you tomorrow. I will help you when you're making the kitchen garden tomorrow. Joon, your phone's been ringing all day. Special treat! You get to eat with Jung Ha Na. Joon! Are we going to the studio? Let's have a corporate eat-out. Eat-out? You're all dead! I'll make you drink. Are you going back home? I will drop you off. The doctor says I'm fine. Stop treating me like a patient. I don't want to say good-byes so early. You have a place you want to go? There are lots of places I want to go. Let's go then. Let's start with some place close. I was sick for a long time in America. So we moved several times in search of a good place for me to rest. No wonder I couldn't find you. I couldn't believe it when I heard that you were dead. I looked for you for a long time. You looked for me... Those guys shooting guns drove me crazy. Hey! Why aren't you drinking? Drink up! Drink up! Cheers! Come on! You can't even drink! Stop drinking. Hey, shut up. We're all going to get messed up tonight. Don't even think about going back home. Joon, you're already messed up. Hey, drink up. Joon! Let's go. Hey! Where are you guys going? Let's go to the 2nd round. I'm going to eat everything. We're going to the 2nd round. What the hell? What? -I'm sorry. -Joon. You a--hole! Bastard! After I got better, I came back to Korea once. And I heard that you were married then. And from then on, I tried my best to forget you. I think my heart was broken back then. Not because you were married... But the fact that I couldn't think about you again, broke my heart. The memories with you made me stronger while I was fighting the disease in America. Thank you for the memories. For making it come true again. For giving me the courage. Thank you! What are you doing here? Where did you hit me? Why are you sleeping in my bed? It's not like that. What do you mean it's not like that? You're right here! Did you leave my window open last night? I probably came because it was cold. I didn't... What happened? Ouch! That's why you can't be a jerk to just anybody. What is this? You got beaten up pretty badly. Who got beat? Imagine what he looks like right now, if I look like this. He's almost dead. It was like 17 to 1. I see... Were there 17 people in the staff yesterday? Huh? How did you know that? That stings! Are you ok? Don't get hurt again. I don't like you getting hurt. I'm sorry that I kept you waiting yesterday. You always keep me waiting. I know... I'm such a jerk. Why don't you just break up with a jerk like me? Should I? Speaking of which... Did something happen? No. Are you sure? Yeah. That's so loud. Stop! Stop! Look! Hey, it's not even right now. It should be 600mm on this side, it's way over 600mm. Is it? You drew this yourself! It's not like you help out. He has the energy to chew her out after all he's gone through last night. I know right? They don't seem to be going out do they? I don't think so. That's what a relationship is! Have you ever seen Joon spending time with a girl like that? I'm really worried. What? Why? It's nothing. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. You should be careful! Let me see. Come here. Sit here and don't move an inch. No! I have to finish that today. I said don't move! What do I do then? I will make it for you. It's going to be harder than it looks. You're good. I'm the kind of person who can do anything he sees. And I do it better than others too. There you go again. Let me join you. You just sit there and sleep. I want to help. I will help you. I didn't really do anything for you up until now. Did Joon make all of that? He's working under the sun! But isn't he so good at everything that it's almost annoying? I can't let Mom ruin herself. - Be careful. - Why did you change so much? Strawberries. You can't eat these alone. Are you done planting? It was sturdier than I expected. What did you expect? Of course it is! I made it... My neck... Joon! Hi. Why are you here again? I thought she was my sister. It's hot. Oh yeah! She really looks the same! Right? Sun Ho? With that photo! What are you talking about? What? You saw the picture too! Dad's college friend that looks just like her! Why did you come today? What is this? What are you talking about? What picture? It's nothing. What? What's wrong with you? What is this? I heard that your mom's sick. I brought lunch! I made it myself! I spent 3 hours on it. I saw Mom making it in the morning. I called your mom. She was so happy, and she told me to come with you. You're coming right? If you're not going to go, she's going to come. You don't want someone sick to come all the way here, do you? You're coming right? I will go too then. I want to visit your mom. I haven't visited her for a long time. Why are you coming? Also! Why aren't you letting me talk about the picture? If a guy hears that a girl looks just like his father's first love, he will be interested. You don't want to him be interested any further do you? Is that true? Yeah! Unlike girls, to guys... First love means a lot. Is that right? So don't mention it. Ok. I always knew that you were so smart. Bye. Bye. Bye. They are so close... You think I want to come with you? I have a lot of work to do anyway! You have a call! 5, 6, 7, 8. Answer the phone. Yeah, Mom. Can I ride in your car? Just a sec. Yeah. We talked until it was late. Really? That must have been nice. Yeah, I'm happy for you. I'll call you later. Did you call your mom? Yes? Why? Just to say bye. You didn't really take my "good-bye" back there. Is your mom badly ill? Hurry up then. I'll see you later. Let's eat together. Joon! Come! Ok! Dress nicely. What? What did you just say? You want to live with that b---- ? Looks like Mr. Suh had someone else. Let's go. Say it again. Hye Jung. Let go! I don't need anything! I don't need anything! You came all the way here to tell me that? So... You want to live with Yoon Hee? You're ok as long as you have her? Please leave. That's enough Mom. Please stop! Everyone! Sorry, I'm late. Let's go. Where? On a date? How do I wear all this? Wear them in front of me. I bought all of them. What did your mom say that made you so happy? I told you that she's seeing her first love again. They had a date in a place that they used to go together. It's really romantic isn't it? I was happy to see them happy. I see. Does your mom's happiness matter that much to you? Is it more important that your happiness? Yes. You could say that I'm lying... But it's true. Because Mom always put my happiness before hers. Also I feel sorry for him and Mom. They liked each other, but they couldn't be together. Why? If... Just... what if... What is it? Let's just stop it. Let's end it here. Subtitles by DramaFever Let's just break up here. You really don't feel anything? Really? Thank you. You're so pretty. Was there a problem with the headquarters? What do you mean resigned? You can't just let this happen! You're the same as everyone else once you're in love. I'm not in love. Before being so stubborn that you wanted to do it, You should have thought if you could do it first! Why are you doing this all of the sudden? I really don't understand. She's crying. Did you see her crying? She's lost it at my performance. From now on, she is... my soul mate.
