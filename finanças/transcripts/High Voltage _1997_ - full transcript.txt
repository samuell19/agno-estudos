Nice shot. Thank you. Nice form. Yeah. Nice balls? Hey, Molly? Molly? Do you ever feel bad about stealing for a living? Why should I feel bad? I'm just trying to survive like everybody else. Get down, now! How 'bout you, Sam? I don't feel bad about nothing. On the floor! Larry? I don't know. I've been doing it for so long, it kinda feels natural now. Ha-ha. Hey, gimme that. Why don't you ask Johnny how he feels? Hey, Johnny? You ever feel bad about stealing for a living? This is America, baby. Everybody steals. Jane? Thanks a lot for giving me the day off yesterday. I really appreciate it. No problem, Molly. Did you get your wedding dress finally? I found the most beautiful dress in the world. I can't wait to show you. Now all I need is something blue and something borrowed. Good luck. This country was founded on violence and crime. How do you think the rich got so rich to begin with? See, the only difference today is most people do it with a pen instead of a gun. How much did you say this bank holds, Molly? Couple hundred thousand. In small bills. You guys really think we'll clear that much? I mean, I know this ain't no liquor store like we're used to, but, I mean, that's not a very big bank. Maybe we should just stick with what we know? Al, we're in and out. No sweat. Excuse me. Are you the manager? Yes, how can I help you? Well, I'll tell you. I want to file a complaint about an employee. Which one? That girl over there. Molly? Yeah, she's rude and insulting and she made a mistake on my deposit last week. Here. Right there. What, are you getting nervous on me now, Al? No. Not... not really. I'm terribly sorry about this, Mister... Smith. Mr. Smith. But... No, no. The mistake doesn't concern me. It's her attitude that does. We are sticking to what we know. A little hole-in-the-wall operation in an isolated neighborhood. It's just like a liquor store, but bigger. See, only this time, we come out with a real take, not the petty cash we're pulling down. Ready, Sam? Let's do it. Give us five minutes, Al. Five minutes. Don't sweat it, buddy. ♪ Here comes Santa Claus. ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ Jingle all the way Just give me five minutes to create a diversion and draw the guard away from the entrance. And then... And then... We're out of business. Forever. Well, I know that this is no excuse, but Molly is getting married tomorrow and she's a little bit on edge. You can be sure that I will have a talk with her. A talk? That's all you're gonna do is have a talk? What's going on? I don't know. Really, there's no need to get... She deserves to be fired. I mean, how can you let a person like that work in this bank? I want to close my account. I'll see that everything is... No, I want to close it right now. Excuse me ma'am, is everything okay? Merry Christmas, ladies and gentlemen. This is a hold-up. Put your hands down. That wouldn't be a smart idea, pal. Don't hurt us. Get down. Ladies and gentlemen, we want the bank's money, not yours. So don't do anything stupid. I hate to kill someone just before Christmas. Molly. Get down now. Now, open the vault. Take that gun out of my face. Let's go, lady. Let's go. Is this your idea of "something borrowed"? Sorry. Move. Come on. Fill it. If I fill it, can I keep it? Hundreds. Hundreds. Hundreds. Where are the small bills? Where are the small bills? This is it. What do you mean, this is it? I mean this is it. There are no small bills. There never are. Son of a bitch. Look, you're running out of time. You gotta get out of here. You have no idea what you're up against. Guys, we're out of here right now. Come on, Larry. Let's go. Johnny, where's the goddamn money? Forget the money. We're walking. What the hell are you talking... It's a drop, now let's go. What about our plans? It's not gonna work. It was a good plan, man. Forget the plan. It's history. What do you mean, history? We planned every angle of this thing. Quit arguing with me, man. There's no time. Let's get out of here, come on. Son of a bitch. Molly, let's go. I'm almost finished. Forget that. Come on. Hey, what are you doing, man? Are you telling me that we came all this way for nothing? That's exactly what I'm telling you. Oh, shit. What was that? Shit. Al's hit. Those aren't cops. Fuck. That's it. Go, go! Go, Molly! Just break it. Let's go! Come on! Come on! Where's Johnny? He's coming. Start the damn car. I guess I don't need that loan after all. Damn it. Come on. Let's go. Damn. What kind of leader are you, Johnny? You said this was our last job. Why the hell did we leave the money? A little bank like that doesn't handle all that cash. Molly said a couple hundred thousand. They were sitting on millions. Millions? Yes, Molly. Millions. We just left it? You wanna mess with the Vietnamese gangs? Even the cops are afraid to mess with them. That's why they never showed up at the bank. If they're laundering drug money through that bank, we don't wanna know about it! Sir. Get out. Talk. Well, I'll tell you what I do know. I shot my way out of a goddamn bank and I got shit to show for it. Well, Sam? Don't you have something to say? Yeah, I've got something to say. Shut the hell up. Yeah, well, screw you, man! Come on! Get your fucking hands off me. I oughta kill both of you right now. Any time you think you can, buddy. What are you guys doing? Watch it, Larry. It wasn't my fault, Mr. Phan. They escaped through the back. I didn't think. It's okay, Tran. Hey. Let's call it a draw. Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right? No hard feelings? Let's get the hell out of here. Sam, I guess our wedding's off tomorrow? Sorry, baby. I guess it wasn't meant to be. So what do we do now, Johnny? Just drive. Give me time to think. At least they didn't take anything. Let me tell you something. Life is face. You lose one, and you lose the other. Do you think I can ignore some street punks that try to steal from me? Here, put it on. I can't believe Al's gone. Yeah. Well, a big screw-up if you ask me. Nobody asked you. Poor Al. Christ, what are we gonna do when the cops find his body, Johnny? The Vietnamese will get rid of it. They don't want the cops involved any more than us. So what now? We stay low for a day. Look, we didn't take anything and none of their guys got hurt, so they got no reason to come after us. So we just lay low and maybe we move on. I guess it's not gonna be much of a Christmas. I guess not. He was really looking forward to it. He wrapped all his gifts to us himself. What a mess. So what are we gonna do with his gifts? Whose gifts? Al. I think we should say a rosary for him. What do you think? For Christ's sake, Molly. I think maybe we have other things to worry about right now, don't you? Sorry. We should tell his family. I think he has a sister on the East Coast. New York, New Jersey, something like that. Terrific. And what are we gonna do, call Information? We should at least say a prayer. He should have had a piece. You know, I'm more interested in making sure I won't need it. All I'm saying is it's not right. We should say a prayer for his soul. For Christ's sake. Hyah! Hyah. Two minutes, tops. Take whatever you need, and then we're out of here forever. Get dressed. Where are we going? Lemme see your I.D., please. Yeah. You look lovely tonight. Talk to me. Talk. They got away. How many men did you send? Seven men. Let me get this straight. You sent seven men and those punks still got away. Is that what you're telling me? I just came from their apartment. There's no trace of them and... all of our men are dead. They killed seven men? Excuse me. Seven men, Harry. Do I have to do everything. Myself nowadays? I want those bastards' balls. Do you understand? I understand, Mr. Phan. Good. Or I will have yours. Go, now. What the hell. Are you looking at? Honey, I think I'd like to go now. Music, please. Good. What do you want me to do? I work 16 hours a day already. Hello? All right, all right. Hey, ya, Frank. Shh. What do you guys want? Listen, we need a place to crash. You know, the four of us. What do you... Who is it, Frankie? It's just some friends, honey. Are you guys crazy coming here? I have a family now. Daddy, where are you? What, did you adopt? Shh. It's all right, sweetheart. I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right there. Please, do me a favor. Get the hell out of here, okay? Frank, we got nowhere else to go, man. Listen, I'll make it worth your while. Shh. Come on, Frank. Listen, we wouldn't come here if we weren't desperate. Johnny, you can keep your money, okay? I couldn't help you guys even if I wanted to right now. The word is out. You're all dead men. Get out of here. Shit. What the hell are we gonna do now? Relax, will ya? I got one more idea. Bulldog? That is a shit idea, John. He's a wacko, man. Well, Larry, got a better idea? Vietnamese mafia? Well, my ass would be in a world of shit if anyone found out I was holding you here, Johnny. But I do owe you, and I always pay my debts. Thanks, Bulldog. Save it. As of now, we're even. Well, we're okay, okay? Now let's get the stuff out of the van. You sure it's all right? Yeah, it's okay. Let's go. How long are they gonna be here? A couple of days, week at the most. A week? Come on, Tammy. Johnny saved my life. Be hospitable. You're too nice, Bulldog. You always let people take advantage of you. Quite a place you got here. Got rations and supplies for the next five years. The Apocalypse is coming, my friend. I'm ready. Yeah, well, if it ain't coming in the next few minutes, I'd like to get some sleep. So sleep. I'll see you in the morning, Johnny? Make that afternoon. Sam? I never killed anybody before. We're gonna get through this, Molly. Trust me. And when we do, we're gonna get married, just like we planned. Catholic? Catholic. Promise me, Sam. I promise, baby. So now what do we do? I got us into this and I'll get us out. When? Now. What? Where are you going? Don't worry. I won't take long. Be back in a couple hours. Are you staying? Perhaps. Can I get you anything? Listen. If I want anything, I will let you know. Come here. Got a light? Why did you warn me in the back? For once, I wanted him to lose. A man who hits a woman is a coward. Guys? You guys, wake up. Hey, wake up. Here. This will keep the swelling down. Who did this? The man you tried to rob. I guess it's more complicated than I thought. You should leave him. You don't just leave Victor. Phan unless it's in a coffin. I've got to get my friends out of this mess. Victor Phan has partners. Very powerful partners. If you'd taken all that money, they'd have had his head. So what do I do now? There's an old saying. "If you cut the dragon, you'd better slay him." So far, you've only cut him. There's no way Johnny would betray us. Maybe he just left us. Come on, Larry. I know where he went. He asked for Jane's address. The bank manager? Doesn't she work for the Vietnamese? How much money did you say he keeps there? Five million. So what do I do? Hit the bank again? Won't work. Security's been increased. Then what? I'm your ticket out of this, Johnny. And you're mine. As long as Phan lives, I'll never be free. So if I do this, it's under one condition. I'm listening. Phan must die. Do you understand me? Keep talking. On Christmas Eve, the nightclub will be closed. Phan'll be there with his partners, handing over the money to be laundered. If you hit him at 10, the partners won't be there yet. Where the hell you been, Johnny? Looking for a solution. We got a lot to talk about. Take a seat, guys. We've known each other for a long time now. When we first met, we were all living on the streets. To tell you the truth, I never expected any of us to survive this long. But we did. We did because we're a team. We got an opportunity here. One job, one hit. We get them off our backs and we come out with enough money to live for the rest of our lives. But there's one thing we gotta consider here. We're dealing with a very dangerous situation and we could all get killed. Whatever we decide, we do it together... or we don't do it at all. They're coming after us. What difference does it make who shoots first? I'm in. I don't see any other choice. It's the only chance we have. Well, Sam? It's up to you. We all go or none of us goes. The way I see it, we're all dead anyway. So let's go for it. All right. How's it going? Just fine. Pictures. Thanks. Good job, Bulldog. Hey, man. I wanna talk to you. Listen, Tammy and I have been thinking this over. We want to be in on the job. No dice, Bulldog. I'm helping you out here, Johnny. And I helped you. Now we're even. No... Listen, listen. Just calm down, Bulldog. You're overzealous. That's what got you in trouble last time, and I had to bail you out, remember? I'm not gonna take that risk. You gonna screw me, Johnny? You got nothing to worry about, buddy. We're all agreed to give you and Tammy a cut for putting us up. Two cuts. One for each of us. One for both of you. Yours. You can split it with Tammy if you want. Now, listen. You can meet us at the bikers' bar after the job is done. We'll be heading over there to pick up the passports. Now, excuse me. I gotta mail these pictures to Paco. Hello. Hi. Here are some drawings of the club as best as I could do them. Thanks. What's the matter? I'm sorry. It's just... it's hard for me to trust anyone. It's okay. It's okay. What about my cut? I should get one of my own, shouldn't I? I'm the one who's been cooking, cleaning, washing blankets, everything else around here. I know, I know. It ain't right, Bulldog, okay? These people are supposed to be your friends. Acquaintances. Whatever. These people, they don't respect you. They think you're a loser. You know what I think? I think we should teach Johnny a little lesson in ethics. Let him take all the money and all the risk. And then we take it from him when we go to get our cut. I always knew there was a reason I loved you. Besides those good looks. Come to Daddy. Just relax, okay? Let's go. Let's do it. Gentlemen, this is it? Come on. Bring on the champagne. Johnny, come on, let's go. I got the money. Let's get out of here. No! Let's get the hell outta here. Let's go. Come on, come on, come on. You told me he would be killed. What about the girl? Well, he shot her anyway, didn't he? Well, what do you wanna do? You want to go back? You want to try to kill him now? How about you, Larry? Well, that's no longer an option now, is it? You guys don't get it. He's gonna follow us wherever we go. He's not gonna stop until we're all dead. Listen, Jane... Hey. Don't touch me. Let's just all relax. Jesus Christ, Johnny. Where you gonna go, Jane? You told me yourself he's gonna find you. The only way to come out of this alive is to stick together. We gotta stick to our plan. Listen, I will get him. I promise. Keep driving, Molly. We stay with our plan. Molly, step on it, would ya? Ready to collect our money? I'm with you, baby. How long is this going to take?

If we're not here when you get here, we're heading to the Sunshine Hotel in Yuma, Arizona. You got that? Sunshine Hotel, Yuma, Arizona. You just be there. So, Johnny, my man. Now that we're square, I gotta get out of here. You know what I mean? It's Christmas Eve. I gotta go to church. I'm reading the Epistle tonight. Be good, man. So now that you're rich, are you gonna try to find another girl to replace me? Molly, look. I know I've done some terrible things, but, baby, you're all I got. And I swear I'll never, ever leave you. So, Slick, what's in the bag? Who wants to know? We all do. Dog food. We like dog food. Doesn't surprise me. So why don't you just hand it over? So why don't you just come and get it? Aw, hell, Johnny. If these boys really want our dog food, why don't we just give it to 'em? Yeah. You really think so, buddy? Shit, yeah. Look at how underfed they are. Well, if they really want it, why don't you just give it to them? Ooh! Come on. Let's go! What about Bulldog? Send him a postcard. Shit. What'd you do that for, asshole? Molly... Sam? Sam! Sam! Sam!

Th-they said they were going to the Sunshine Hotel, Yuma. Th-that's all I know. Thank you, boys. Look at my bar. Sunshine Hotel, Yuma, Arizona, and we don't want your dog food. Where's your bathroom? I love you, Sam. I'll always, always love you. Honey, we gotta go. I can't leave him like this. You're not really leaving him. Sam is always gonna be with you. Come on, Johnny. God damn it. You know, what... What you and Sam had, that was special. You think so? Yeah. When it comes to love, there is no distance of death. Really? Absolutely. I'd give everything I ever had for one day of what you and Sam had. What are we doing, Johnny? We gotta bury him. Jesus Christ. We don't have time for that shit. We're talking about Sam, Larry. We can't just leave him there like that. Here. Let's get it over with, all right? Molly, you told me you had a family. That was just a cover at the bank. Sam and Johnny and Larry... The only family I ever had. Do you have any family, Jane? No. Well, you're with us now. How could you get a goddamn flat tire? We're never gonna get that money. We'll get there, baby. I promise. Yeah, right. I always keep my word. Carlo? Johnny! Long time no see? I don't believe my eyes. Each time I see you, you look like exactly your father. A very fine man. How you doin', Carlo? Better, better, man. I must tell you. I still miss this, though. Listen. Remember Larry, Molly? Sure. This is Jane. Hey, where is Sammy? He didn't make it. I'm sorry. Listen, did you get my reservation? Si, si. Don't worry, Johnny. I take care of everything. That's for you. You're very generous, Johnny. Do you know how much I love you? Do you know how much I love your father? And just your money's no good here. By the way, I only have three bedrooms. The hotel is, under... under... Renovation? Renovation. This English language drives me nuts. Anyway, I have the best three bedrooms in the house. 21... 22... 23. Enjoy your stay. Let's go. Sorry. So how do you know Carlo? He's my father's cousin from Sicily. He ran into some trouble with a New York mobster and he made an offer they couldn't refuse, so they basically tried to kill him instead. Ee-ee. Now he runs this hotel and... he occasionally sells cars. He sells cars? Well, stolen. He dumps them in Mexico. Today's Christmas. I never really had a real Christmas. Well, now you do. Johnny. It's beautiful. Merry Christmas. Johnny! Johnny, open up! It's the wrong time. Come on, Johnny. Open the goddamn door. Come on. The Vietnamese are here. I'll get my guns. I'm with you. Okay. Johnny. What? Buon giorno, signori. Can I help you? I guess not. Where are they? Why don't you try upstairs? Grazie. You looking for me, Phan? No. Her. Send her down. Forget about it. You let me get a mile down the road, I'll drop her off and your share of the money. How could anyone be so stupid? That is the question. He sold you out. Did he? Did you, Larry? Nah. You didn't really think I could betray Johnny, now, did you? Why... why'd you hit him? Realism. We didn't know if you could act, baby. Just like in Sicily. The best time. Welcome to the web, Phan. Said the spider to a stupid fly. Get the rest of your men inside. Out, Bulldog. Hey, Johnny. Move, move. Move, Jane. Come on. Come on. Jane, you ever use one of these before? Guess so. Get down and we hit them from behind. Come on. Johnny! You son of a bitch! Come on, go. Let's go. Get him out! Molly, come on. Through here! Johnny! One cut? Yeah, well, Tammy's dead, Johnny. So I guess I don't have to split my cut with her? I'll cut you in. How could you betray me like this? It was easy. You belong with me. What a pity. Greed will always kill you. Go to hell, Johnny. No, pal. You're the one who's going to hell. Molly. Molly? Shh. It's over. Okay? It's over. Shh. Good try, amigo. Go and get the cars. A few inches lower and you really would've had a problem. Only me? You're pretty confident, aren't you? Yah. Excuse me. All right. You're confident, too. Giovanni. Carlo. Well, I'm really sorry about everything. Don't worry about it. I don't have enough money, anyway, to finish the job. Well, now you do. Ciao. Let's go. Arrivederci. Arrivederci. Mamma mia! Johnny, you're just like your father. Crazy! Shut up.
