Daddy, shall I pour Patrick's milk? Yeah, you might as well, honey. And don't worry? I'm sure they'll be here any minute. Patrick? Patrick? Patrick, Patrick, what's happening to us? I don't know. Hello? Where the hell are you? Jesus, what the hell are you doing there? No, no, I'll, I'll come for you. Jill, I said I'd come for you. They're all right. Hey, I tell you what we do. You will watch the pot, while I go and collect them, okay? Patrick? Patrick, don't you want to eat something? No. I want to go to bed. Darling, just sit up for a minute. - Have something to eat. - I want to go to bed. Look out for the... For the burnt parts. Philip? Go to bed, Jill. I'm trying to work. You shut me out with your silence. You shut yourself in. But was it such a crime to get on that barge? I didn't mean to upset you, you know that. - I didn't realize how late... - Look, you never mean anything and you never realize anything! But I've been late before. You've never been this upset. What is it? What is it this time? Because I can't stand it anymore because I've had enough. You're like a child, Jill, you're like Patrick. You and Patrick, two little selfish children running off, doing whatever the hell you please. Now who gave you an idea to go on a barge? Nobody. Nobody. You just did it. Just like that because you felt like it. Haven't you ever done anything just like that because... because you felt like it, because the idea came to you? Have you always done exactly what you're supposed to do? Yes. When you got pregnant, I married you. Wasn't that what I was supposed to do? Jill... Jill. Oh, honey... I'm sorry, I didn't mean that. I wanted to marry you. I loved you. I love you. I don't know what's the matter. It's just... It's just that I'm sick and tired of being taunted. Taunted? You're right, Philip. We shouldn't talk. Words don't mean the same thing to each one of us. Go back to your equations. You understand them. Philip, what's happened to us? What is it? I'm sorry. Philip. Darling, you said to do what I feel like. Well, I feel like it. Philip. No. I don't want to. Please, honey, Jill. What are you doing with daddy's pen? Fish write. What do they write? Newspapers. But it's true! At the market, they always put them in newspapers. We better hurry up, Cynthia is waiting for us. Okay, I'm coming. Ready? Can you say goodbye to daddy? “Yes! We're going to the flea market! Bye, Philip. Be back at 12. Goodbye. I'll do it. Okay, go. - Cynthia! - Cynthia! Coming! Hello! Come on! Cathy... Don't go far. Oh, cyn, come here. Oh. - Look at this. - Oh, yeah. - Isn't it beautiful? - That is romantic. Isn't it beautiful? You know the lady who owned this was in love. Why don't you buy it? It's probably very expensive. What time is it, cyn? Why is the time so important? Because we have to be home by noon. I want to try to get Philip out of the house this afternoon. I don't want him to be angry again. We're not stuck on a barge, you know. Whenever we want we can drive home. Do you like this? It's sweet, isn't it? - It's probably done by hand. - Does he always get so angry when you're late? No. Not like this, you know. I mean, he gets upset, but he's been very on edge lately. Bang, bang, bang, I got an Indian! There aren't any Indians in France. All right now, I'm going to buy you each a present. - What would you like, Patrick? - This. Yes? All right. Cathy? “This. - You sure? - Yeah. Very pretty. Hello. Mr. Hallard. Please sit down. You're looking well. Thank you. How's your charming wife? Let's see. You've been in Paris two years. Cathy must be eight and Patrick, Patrick must be four. I understand you have an apartment on rue mazarine. That's quite a change from your house in Laurel Canyon, isn't it? I know how easily you can get information. And you're working for a publisher. Reptile. Advances of modern science. You're wasting your time. My answer is no. I have a contract with me. Of course. Another contract. No. Not if you offered me one million dollars. A million? I don't think we could go that high. Once you sign the contract, you will have a very important job. You tell me you don't want a million dollars, Mr. Hallard, but there is something you do want. Don't try to deny it. You want to use your considerable gifts. That brain of yours is deteriorating every month, every day you allow it to be idle. You can go back to your work now and be as brilliant as before. Let another year or two go by and as far as physics or mathematics go, you will be finished. After you, let me put it this way, repay our generosity... You won't see us anymore and the job remains yours. You're lying. You will never stop. I give you my word. Your word. Oh, I am sorry you've made such a hasty decision, Mr. Hallard. Very, very sorry. Philip, come out and play with us. No, darling, not now, please, I can't, I'm working. Oh, but you worked enough today. You work too much all the time. Come on, daddy, you can play with my gun! Oh, I can. Well, you better watch it, buster, I got a gun of my own. Philip, it's Sunday, come out. I can't, honey. I'd like to get in the car with my father. Hey. You promise not to talk? May I have a pad and a pencil? Patrick, wait for me. Getting ready to leave, are you? Just where the hell do you think you're going? I asked you a question, Philip. You know damn well where I'm going. I'm taking a plane to duluth at 11. Well, never mind, we'll send boucher. What you can do is collect your pay and get out of here. And by the way, you're not quitting, you know. You're fired. Just what the hell are you talking about? Damnedest thing that's ever happened in my career. You know where my office is. Why didn't you come around and see me yourself? The wife calling up the employer? My wife? Your wife called me up to say that you're leaving at the end of the month. Well, that's ridiculous. Somebody is playing tricks on you. Your wife called me, Philip. That's impossible. I'm sure I recognized her voice. She called up to say that you weren't getting enough money here and that you were leaving. Well, I can assure you that nothing is further from my mind. Listen, Philip, has your wife been having any kind of emotional upset recently? It wasn't my wife. I better get going. Listen, my boy, we've been having great success up to now. And with this new book, it'll be even bigger. I've even been planning a big raise for you. Thank you, I can use it. Look, I just got to get going or I'm gonna miss that plane. Did I tell you the first printing is for 50,000? That's how much confidence I have in you. Come in! - Hi, Patrick! - Hi. You left your keys in the door. Again. I'll put them here so you won't forget where they are, okay? Okay. My contributions to dinner tonight. Ah, terrific. - I'll put them on ice. - Okay. Patrick might swallow these pills. You shouldn't leave them open on the sink. What do you mean "open on the sink"? Where's the lid? Isn't it there? I don't know. At least he can't reach them here. I was sure I put those pills away. Doesn't matter, they're okay now. Say... That is interesting. I like it, I really do like it. Do you? It's yours. No, but I'll buy it from you. Oh, Cynthia. After all you've done for us. I'd like you to have it if you want it. No, but someday I shall be able to boast about my early Jill Hallard. - I'll never be famous, cyn. - Well, why not? I mean, you're selling them, aren't you? Well, only to that creepy little guy on rue be seine and I think he's more interested in me than my paintings. Doesn't matter. As long as he buys. It's too bad you have to blow it all on that doctor. Well, I know. But it's important to me, cyn. I have to get better. Well, I have to show apartments this afternoon to two old widows from Baltimore. Now I think they've come to Paris to live it up. They even asked me if I knew any unattached men. French men. Maybe you ought to think about going into that business. No thank you. I think I'll stick to my real estate. By the way, if you and Philip ever decide to go back to America, I can rent this place for you in a minute. - Bye, Patrick. - Bye. At a very good price too. ♪ Why are you so ♪ ♪ why do you do that ♪ ♪ why are you so crazy ♪ - hello, madame Hallard. - Hello, Ann. What can I do for you? I have an appointment with the doctor. Not today, madame Hallard. - Well, today is Wednesday. - Tomorrow is Wednesday. Well, could I s... could I see the doctor just for a moment? He's not in. He's at the clinic. I'm sorry. Hello? Hello? - Hello, Jill! - Philip! Hello, darling. Listen, Jill, did you call Britain and complain about my salary? - Did I what? - Listen, darling... What? Philip, what? Did you call Britain and complain about my salary? No. No, I didn't call and complain about your salary. - What do you mean, Philip? - Are you absolutely sure? Yes, I'm positive. I think I'm positive. All right, don't get upset, darling. I'll be home in two or three days. Look, I've got to go. I'll see you soon. What is your name? Hansen. H-a-n-s-e-n. - S-e-n? - Yeah. Was he good? Oh, I didn't know he was there. A little angel. Seven letters ending in I. Parasol. Right. Remind me to take my umbrella when I leave. - Is it here? - You borrowed it a couple of days ago. I borrowed it? It was raining and you were on your way to Philip's office. It was two days ago. It's the red one. It's not there. You probably left it somewhere. I'll buy you another one. Oh, listen, I leave umbrellas all over Paris. Now don't worry about it. What worries me is that I can't remember. Have you heard from Philip? No, he just left today. He'll probably call tomorrow. Sydney, he's been in London a week. Not... not one call. You know he loves you. He... he loves to go to bed with me. You know what? It's funny how men can separate the two. I mean, I... I... I can't go to bed with a man that I don't love. - Can you? - No. Not with one who doesn't love me. Have you, had many affairs? Only Philip. Since I was... Twenty. Twenty. Well, aren't you the faithful one? Not that I blame you, Philip is wildly attractive. No, he's more than that, he... He's so brilliant. Hey. Come on now. What's wrong? We've grown so... Grown so far away from each other. Well, do you think he has, has another woman? No. No. He just... He's changed, so... So closed up inside himself. He works all the time. Why has he changed, do you know? No. I don't know. Listen, madame. - Oh, what? - I have an idea. Now why don't you and I go out and we can have a drink somewhere, we can live it up a little. I mean, it'll cheer us up. Okay. The children. Well, what about that agency? What's its name? On the rue de rennes, yeah. Yeah. Well, it's closed. Well, why don't you... Okay. Let's have a drink here then. To men. Damn them all. ♪ I do indeed ♪ ♪ maybe the doctor will tell me presently ♪ Patrick? What do you think of this? Do you like it? Not anymore. Okay. - Madame Hallard? - Yes. Are you from the agency? - Yes. - Come in. Is that him? Yes, that's him. I'll be right back. My name is Lucy. I took a risk calling you, but I had to warn you. Oh, sure. Yes. You're a friend of mine, aren't you? Maybe. I can tell you what they're planning to do if you refuse to go back. But you're a big boy. You'll have to make your own decision. Patrick? Oh, Patrick, baby, what happened? What happened to him? I slapped him. You what? Well, he almost poked my eye out with his pen. Look, he is only a little boy and you are here to take care of him, not to punish him! Now will you get out of here? You owe me for three hours, madame. What is your name? Lucy. Lucy what? - What is your name? - Stevens. What was that? I forgot the groceries. Is there mail today? Are there letters for me today? The letter is in the bottle! Come on. What's in my mailbox? Cathy wrote to Santa claus. She did.Here. Ah. Oh, there's another one. That's one, two, three. "This is good for two kisses. Cathy." Ah. What's that? - What does that mean? - A kiss. - A kiss. - For you. For me? You're funny. Funny boy. What do you want for Christmas? - A clown's hat. - A clown's hat! Okay. Cathy! Come on. Mommy! NY pat... Patrick, I can't drive if you do that. Ah! No! Pa... Patrick. Patrick, now sit down! That's enough, you acrobats! Cathy, you're... oh. Cathy! Cathy, Cathy. Cathy, are you all right? Mommy. Patrick. - Hello, Phil. - Daddy, come in! It's enough. "We were scared. Thinking of you." Those are beautiful. Who are they from? Me. You're trembling. Philip? No! No! Jill. Philip. _jill. Philip, wake up, we're safe. Philip. I thought the truck was going through the yellow. It was my fault. I'm sorry. I dreamt we were living on an island. Nobody else but us. Hey. Patrick. Patrick. My sunshine. Go. Make music. Tonight, I want to look the most beautiful of all. I want to go and see the toys! I want to go and see the toys! You know, there will be a lot of men just like daddy there, writers and publishers. Zip me, darling. I want to see the toys! For heaven's sake. Tell me, do you like this dress? Is it nice? - Is it pretty? - Yes! Ah, good. - But you have the same one. - What, Cathy? You bought it a month ago. Your sister is crazy. Hey, oh. Like this. You're a silly boy. Oh, Patrick, what are you doing? Here it is. But I bought it twice. I didn't remember that it was already at home in my closet. Could I... could I have a cigarette? Certainly. Last week you told me about an umbrella. Yeah, Cynthia's. I borrowed it on the way to Philip's office. And Philip insists you've never been to his office. Now where did I go? Where? Is it possible that you didn't go anywhere? Didn't go out at all? Well, why would I tell Cynthia? Perhaps you didn't even borrow the umbrella. What are you saying, doctor, that Cynthia lied? Why don't you consider the possibility that Cynthia may have had a lapse of memory? Often, when you've told me about forgetting things, it's happened when Cynthia is around. - Oh, that's not true. - Many times. But if it... if it is, isn't that natural? I mean, we're together a lot of the time. I'm afraid our time is up. Doctor, I don't know what you're driving at. I bought the dress two times. I was alone when I bought the dress. I don't even know myself. It's just something to think about. Pat... Cathy, I'm going to make a phone call. I'll be right back. Wait here, do you hear me, Cathy? Wait right here. Yes, hello, this is madame Hallard. Yes, it's for someone for tonight before 7:00. Yes, you'll have to give the children dinner. Come on, the babysitter is waiting for us. Come on, be nice. We won't be back until very late. Okay, thank you. No! Hey. Come on. But mademoiselle Hansen said you were downstairs. Patrick. Take this. Come on. Mommy, what about mademoiselle Hansen? Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! What do you know? What do you know? He left his scarf at the puppet show. Patrick! Patrick! Cathy! Patrick! Patrick! Patrick! What do you know? What do you know? He left his scarf at the puppet show. Madame. Oh. Hello. Britain knows how to publicize your books. - Philip. - Lovely to meet you. - Excuse me. - Mr. batale is so sorry that your wife couldn't come. After all, the party was for your book. Yes, thank you, excuse me, please. Who are you? What are you doing here? I'm the babysitter. I've been waiting here for more than an hour. Phone rang several times. Hello, Jill? Who is this? What? Where? What police station? Hello? Well, I have to leave very early tomorrow. Do you want me to come back in an hour? No. No, I'll call you if I need you. I'm gonna try and get her into bed. Maybe a tranquilizer. If... if only I'd gone with her today. You can't be with her all the time. I'd never have let her go near the water. Don't blame yourself. You have your job. Call us if you need us. Patrick's scarf! This is Patrick's scarf! Hold on, that's mine. Who is Patrick? There, right on the edge. What are these paintings about? Oh, come, come, come, madame Hallard. Didn't you tell your art dealer you wanted to paint what you saw in the water? No, I didn't tell him I painted what I saw in the water. I like to paint water. He's seen my paintings, but... You've spent a lot of time by the river. Did you or didn't you? Yes. I paint there. Patrick liked to play there. You were in a bad auto accident recently, yeah? Yes. This trouble with your memory, how long has it been going on? About two... two year... Since we came here, about two years. Do you feel your husband is burdened with the children? Sometimes I feel that. I understand that you and your husband haven't had sexual relations for a very long time. Is that true, madame Hallard? Then your husband has a mistress. No. Oh, indeed. A young man with no sex in his life? I think your husband does have a mistress, - and you know it. - No, that's not true. You just feel your husband doesn't love you. Look. Speak up, madame. He's a brilliant man. I think he loves me. Did you ever think of killing yourself? How? Mothers have been known to commit suicide with their children. In some cases, children get killed. And the mother loses her nerve. How... No, no! No! No! I don't understand. There doesn't appear to be a motive. You're not a wealthy man. Were you asked for a ransom? No. I regret to say, monsieur Hallard, I must keep your wife here. Why? Why? She hasn't done anything wrong. If that's the case, we won't have to keep her long. Look, I know my wife had nothing to do with this. I'm absolutely positive. Do you have other information you want to share with me? No. Where did you get that candle? Where's my mother? And the matches. I forbid you to touch him. Go to sleep now. Go to sleep. Mommy, what about mademoiselle Hansen? Mademoiselle Hansen? Hansen? What is your name? Hansen, h-a-n-s-e-n. Hansen. Wait! No... Put that down. Give me that, give it to me. Please. Give me that. Give me that. I remember hearing Cathy say, "mademoiselle Hansen said you were downstairs." Now, mademoiselle Hansen is a babysitter that I have used once. Dark hair, dark eyes, slender, about 30. Yes. Your little boy left a yellow scarf on the bench at the show. A woman of this description came and asked for it. - You see? - Which agency do you use? Rue de rennes. 873-0... no, 873-8..., 873-8... But that's my name. I'll show you my passport. Erika Hansen, Swedish student. Oh no. I never saw her before. First you said she is mademoiselle Hansen. Now you say she isn't mademoiselle Hansen. Which is it? This person has never been to my apartment. Who used your name? Who came to my apartment instead of you? Would you prefer to come to the police station and ask some questions there? - Who is she? - I don't know who she is! She said that she knew the little boy, that he looked just like her own son who died. She begged me to let her take my place. And you fell for it? I felt sorry for her. I didn't see any harm. We often swapped jobs and things. Where did you meet her? At the student center. What happened to the check Mrs. Hallard gave her? She brought it to me. She offered to give me more money, but I thought there was something fishy and I didn't take it. I swear I didn't. Where is she? Where does she live? I don't know, I never asked her. Get your coat, mademoiselle, you're coming with me. No, what are you going to do to me? - Get your coat. - I didn't... Do you think that she knows anything? We'll see. If she doesn't, can you find that woman? We'll find her. You mustn't worry. In cases like these, the women are mentally ill. They take good care of their victims. I'll drive you home. Is there anything I can do for you? No, nothing. I know Jill so well. It seems impossible that she... That she what? Would do anything to hurt the children. Oh, Cynthia, please don't be ridiculous. What is it, Philip? Please tell me. Tell me. Tell me. You'll feel better if you talk about it. It's because of me that they've taken the kids away. Oh. I don't understand. You know, for two years they left me alone, and I was stupid enough to think I was rid of them. Who are they? That's what's so funny, I don't even know. "The organization," they call themselves. That's all I know about them. You must think I'm some kind of a mad man. I was mad once. This time I let them trap me. They always found a way to get to me. Always. They always find a way. Like now, taking my children. What do they want? Oh... These polished and cultivated gentlemen are interested in my work, my brain. They specialize in industrial espionage. I was a very high-class kind of informer. They want you to do it again? Yes. They want me to sign a contract, contract with a top company, a new job. Well, I'll sign it, I'll sign anything. Why the hell doesn't it ring? Why don't they call me? I want my children back. I want Jill. She's my life. She's the only good thing that ever happened to me. Oh, Jesus, why don't they call? Please, Cynthia, go to bed. You must know how much I care for you. If there's anything... Yes, yes, I know, please, just go to bed. Jill. How long have you been here? I heard everything. Darling. - Oh, Jill, I'm sorry. - Oh, Philip. You can go ahead. He's ready. Yes? Yes? Hello? Is it... yes. Yes, I understand. All right, I'll be there as soon as I can. Philip. - I'm coming with you. - No, darling, you mustn't. I must go alone. If they see anybody with me, they won't come near me. Here. Jill. You're back. Oh, my poor darling. The children. God. When did they let you go? Late last night. Everything's going to be all right, I know it. I feel it. You do? Cathy brought that down the other day after school. I know. She adores you. So does Patrick. It was lucky for us when you found us that apartment upstairs. For me, too. I found myself a ready-made family. It was terrible being locked up in jail like a murderer. Idiot police. Philip and I were out of our heads with worry. You were very kind to stay with him. Whenever we're in trouble, you're always there. That's what friends are for. While I was in jail, I thought about you. You have a job, you have Sydney, you have a lot of friends. And yet you spend all your time with us. I love you. Did you ever find your red umbrella? Doesn't matter, I don't care. Did you ever have a red umbrella? It's not important. Since we moved in, you've been spying on us, haven't you? What? You're with the organization, aren't you? What organization? Jill, you really are falling apart. No, no, I'm not. You'd like that. Wouldn't you like that? You want to destroy us, now don't you? No. Yes! No! Yes! Don't you understand? Yes, I understand! Yes. You know. You know where my children are. Now you're going to tell me. You're going to tell me or I'll kill you. How did you find out? Where are my children? Where are my children, please? As soon as Philip signs the contract, they'll return the children. No. No, there won't be the meeting. I saw them, I saw the police following Philip. There won't be a meeting. What are you doing, Mr. Hallard? I have a few questions. Please, go on. Were you waiting for someone? Who? Mr. Hallard, I must insist you answer. Come on. Everything. And start from the beginning. Hello? Yes. Can I talk? You can. I think you should know what happened. Go ahead. Contact could not take place. He arrived with an escort. You should have known this and warned us. Report to us immediately. You were right. There was no meeting. They don't give me much information. I'm not important enough. Everything is coded and split up among several of us. All I have is a telephone number. Come on, let's go. Put these on. Now wait for me here. And please don't move, promise me. Just a minute. You haven't told me everything, Mr. Hallard. Cynthia. Jill. Jill! Jill! Jill? May I use the phone? I don't understand. Let's go to my office. I'm to keep her here? Yes. Okay. Cynthia. Cynthia telephoned where the children are, and there was no answer. What number? What number? If you give me the number, I can find the address. Wait. Nine. - Nine-eight-nine. - Nine-eight-nine. I can't remember. You must remember. 989-1213. 989-1213. Jill, Jill. Come on. Jill! Cathy? Cathy. That's me. Patrick. Let Cathy finish her drawing. Cathy, isn't there a door?
