Thanks for the lift. Any time, Mrs. Reardon. And how does your husband like having his own office? Fine. Clients are just pouring in. Goodbye. One fine little woman, that Mrs. Reardon. Please, let's not have a scene. Look, it's just as tough on me as it is on you. Listen, let's face the facts. You're a luxury. I can't afford a luxury. I can't keep you any longer. After all, I'm a married man I've got to think of my wife. And about time. Oh, Mrs. Reardon. Sally. What's going on here? Maybe you can explain to Miss Jacobs that I'm letting her go only because business is so bad, I can't afford to keep a stenographer. Oh. Now don't cry, Miss Jacobs. Someday this will be the largest detective agency in town, then my husband will take you back at a bigger salary. Now look, here's a bonus for you. Oh, thank you. Thank you, Mrs. Reardon. I don't mind anything, but your husband shouldn't have called me that name. What did you call her, Bill? I didn't call her any name. You did too. You called me a stenographer, and I'm a private secretary. Listen, I gave her a week's salary. Why the extra $5? $10, for being here six months without flirting with you. Oh, yeah? Lady, you've been robbed. Why that little... Well, that settles it. From now on, I'm your secretary. No, no. No thanks. I don't need a secretary. I don't even need a stenographer, so you go on home, see if you can't think up a good menu for a change. I'm tired of going home, cooking for you. I want to go out in the world and meet people. Oh, no... No, it's no life for a girl like you. Millions of clamoring clients, the white lights, the gay night life! Oh no, go home... Go home little girl, before it's too late. Mister, for better or for worse from now on I'm your secretary. All right, take a letter. To whom please? Oh, what's the difference? Oh, Bill, keep your chin up. Rome wasn't built in a day. Who cares about Rome? All I'm interested in is in the career of William H. Reardon. Now listen to me young lady, six months ago I was making $3,500 a year as special investigator in the district attorney's office. Doing all the work while the DA got all the glory. Now you listen to me, Bill Reardon. I did once, now look at me. My own boss, no work, no glory, and nothing a year. Success. Someday you'll thank me for making you go on your own. You're the best detective in this town, and you know it. Yeah, I know it and you know it. The trouble is nobody else knows it. Some day they'll find out. Now tell me something, Snooks. If I'm as smart as you say, how did I happen to fall for a dumb dame like you? Believe me, I've sat up nights worrying about just that thing. Well, there you are. If I'm really a good detective, I'd be able to explain how the whole thing happened. You are a good detective. You're just stupid. Oh, now I'm stupid. About some things. A minute ago I was the smartest guy in town, now I'm stupid. Well, make up your mind, which is it? Both. You are the smartest guy in town, but it's publicity you're stupid about. Nobody knows you have an office. How do you expect to get any clients? I bet I could get more publicity in two minutes than you've gotten in six months. Oh, yeah? Yeah. All right, young lady, from now on suppose you take charge of the whole office. Hmm, for two cents I would. Well, if I had two cents... Maybe that's a customer. Maybe. Yes, sir. May I see Mr. Reardon, please? Yes, sir. Mr. Reardon, here's a client. I'll get those letters right out, Mr. Reardon. Oh, pardon me. Oh, dear. Well... Oh, excuse me. Right there. Oh, yes, yes. Oh, busy days these. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, Bill, did you get it? I'll say I did. Oh, what is it? A divorce case? No. They want us to do some collecting for them. A fellow owes them some money. Well, anything is better than nothing. Did you get an advance? No, no. It's not the sort of thing you can ask for an advance on. You dope, you can get an advance on anything. Yeah? All right, see for yourself. Oh, Bill, what are we gonna do now? I'm doing it. Hello? Is the District Attorney there? Don't talk to that guy. Don't talk to him, Bill! Hello, Joe? Yeah, this is Bill Reardon. When will he be in? Half an hour? Okay. Thanks. Where's your pride? I just swallowed it. Listen, honey, I'm not going on relief when there's a good job waiting for me. Come on. Well, you can quit if you want to, but I'm going to carry on here. All right, baby, you carry on until the first of the month. You might take care of this, too. I'll call you in half an hour. Wish me luck. Yes, I do. I hope you don't get the job. Well, if we don't there's a cute little bench in Central Park where we can spend the winter. Oh, Bill. You'd better start packing. Pack up? What's there to pack? A lot of silly pictures as far as I can see. Never could run an office. He's just a schlemiel, that's all. I beg your pardon, is Mr. Reardon in? No. Well, can you tell me when he will be in? I want to see him on business. Business? Oh, won't you sit down. Mr. Reardon has gone out for a moment, and a... When will he be back? Well, he won't. That is, right now he is out on a very important case and I don't know exactly when he will be back. Would you like him to call you? I prefer not to leave my name. Oh, just as you wish, Mrs. Fraser. How did you know my name? Your picture was in the paper when you were married. It is a detective's business never to forget a face. Are you a detective? Oh, yes. Yes. I'm Mr. Reardon's chief operator. I handle all the women clients. You see, women often feel they can talk more freely to another woman. There may be something in that. Do sit down. There. You'll promise to keep the matter confidential? I won't even discuss it with Mr. Reardon. Oh, he'll have to know, won't he? Not unless you want him to. Your case will be entered on our books as a number. Just a moment. Our last case was No. 375. Your case number will be 376. Now what can I do for you? There's someone I'd like to have followed. Her name is Anne Calhoun. Has this inscription anything to do with it? She was engaged to my husband before I. I'm beginning to understand. There hasn't been anything to understand until recently. Suddenly, Mr. Fraser has been getting letters and phone calls from her. I haven't spied, but I know her handwriting and I know her voice. There's something going on between them and you've got to find out what it is. 376, I'll stake my reputation on it. If I don't solve this case before the first of the month, I'll retire from business. Fine. Tomorrow I'm going away on a two week trip and when I get back, I want a complete report on Anne Calhoun, everybody she sees and where and when she sees them. You go away and forget it. Maybe I'll have good news for you when you get back. Any news will be better than this suspense. Oh, by the way, my husband and I are going to the Skyline Club tonight for dinner with believe it or not, Miss Calhoun. If you want to get a good look at her. I'll be there. Thanks for the tip. I don't know what your rates are, but this should do until I get back. Oh, thank you. Thank you Miss... Operator number seven. Goodbye. Goodbye. One, two, three, $300. $300! One, two, three. Well, what this office needs is a few pictures on the wall. This will go here. Oh, Bill, we should have done this a long time ago. Reardon Detective Agency. Operator... Oh, hello, Bill. You sound awfully happy. Oh, you landed that job with the District Attorney? Why, that's very nice. What's the salary? 75 smackers a week and every week. What's the matter? You don't sound very enthusiastic. Oh, I think it's wonderful. Yes, I really do. And how's the Reardon Agency coming along under its new management? Splendidly, thank you. Customers are popping in all over the place. Customers, ha. Name one. Why, Bill, I'm surprised, the Reardon Detective Agency never reveals the name of its clients. That's our policy. What did you say? Any more bills come in? Why yes, three of them. Aw, forget them. What do you say we celebrate tonight? Oh, gee, that sounds swell. Where do I want to go? Well, let's see. How about the Skyline Club? Can we afford that? No, we cannot afford the Skyline Club. Don't be silly. Bill, just this once please. All right, if you promise to have one drink and the regular dinner. None of that a la carte stuff. I promise. All right. The Skyline Club. Little gold-digger. And then I'll take some filet mignon. Oui, madame. Ixnay. Oh yes, ixnay. You mean instead of filet mignon? Do you have any ixnay? Ixnay? Pardon? Well, never mind if you haven't any. I'll just take filet mignon. Madame. You see, they're all out of it. And, uh, chiffonade salad. Salad chiffonade, madame. Then I'll have strawberry parfait and coffee. Pork chops on the regular dinner. Any wine, monsieur? No. Oh, I'll take some. No, no wine. Thank you, monsieur. You mean, no wine? That's what I mean, no wine. Not even a teeny-weeny itsy-bitsy? Not even a teeny-weeny itsy-bitsy. You mean, no wine. Yeah, that's it, no wine. Religious scruples? No, no, just mathematics. Filet mignon, $3.50, strawberry parfait, 75 cents, six martinis. I only had three. But they're charging me for mine, too, you know. And all I've got in my pocket is a 20 dollar bill. You don't happen to have a couple of dollars in your purse, do you? Money? Why didn't you say so? I've got half a dollar. Hand it over. I'm in no mood for quibbling. Oh, Shane. Hello, Mr. Reardon. Just the man I want to see. Will you cash a check for me? Sure. What do you want? Oh, not much, 25. You better make it 50 in case we want some wine. Yeah. Oh, Mr. Shane, Mrs. Reardon. How do you do? Here's your 50. Thanks. Got a pen? Yes. You're taking an awful chance, Mr. Shane. I don't think he has $50 in his account. Say, she has a great sense of humor. Yeah. Can I buy you a drink? No, thanks. Have one on the house. Oh, no, we couldn't do that. Oh, you can have one more, Bill. I'm taking you home. What will it be, Mrs. Reardon? A martini, please. Same thing. Jim, three martinis. Haven't seen you around lately. No, no, I've been pretty busy. How do you like being on your own? Well, I'm not exactly on my own anymore. I'm back with the DA again. Say, you don't happen to have his home phone number, do you? Why, yeah. Lexington 28672, but he won't be home till pretty late. Thanks. To you, Mrs. Reardon. Oh, to you, Mr. Shane. May your checks never bounce back. Remind me to talk to you when we get home. Pardon me, sir, but you are wanted in the office. Oh, excuse me. I'll probably see you around later. Yeah. Nice personality. Yeah, most gamblers have. Gambler? He happens to own that casino across the river. Oh, why didn't I marry a man like that instead of a prohibitionist. Your table is ready, monsieur. All right, thanks. Come on. Psst, psst. Come on, that looks swell. This one will be all right. Wouldn't madame prefer the table over by the window? No, we can't see anyone over there. I like this one right in the center of things. We can watch people coming in. As you wish, madame. Monsieur. I don't know why we couldn't have had a decent table. What's wrong with this table? Oh, nothing, this is great. Nice draft, too. I knew you'd like it. Do you remember way back when I said I'd take you to the Skyline Club and you promised you would go light on everything? Oh, that was before we made the $50. Hmm. Yes, it was. Of course, we didn't quite make the $50. There's just a chance that Mr. Shane might deposit that check. Well, even if he does that's $50 more than we came in with. That's certainly a profit. Hmm. Yes, it certainly is. Do me a favor, will you? Don't mention it to the income tax people. Oh, you can trust me, Bill. Puree mongole? No, my name is Reardon. Good evening, Mr. Fraser. Good evening. Your table is all ready. Oh, thank you. I wish you weren't going away, darling. I'll probably be sorry myself. Why don't you get yourself a pair of field glasses? As long as I'm paying 90 cents for that puree mongole, I'd like to see you eat some of it. Why don't you watch where you're going? Anything wrong, madame? I should say there is. If you think I'm going to sit here and be jostled about by everyone you're mistaken. But the guy never came anywhere near you. I don't see how you have the nerve to offer anyone this table. I want to sit over at that table. Come along, Bill. Sorry, madame. Your wife? You want to make anything out of it? Breast of guinea hen and heart of artichoke in butter sauce. This is more like it. Are you angry at something, Bill? Me? No, what have I got to be angry about? Well, I don't know. You just look like you're ready to sock somebody in the jaw. No, no, I got over that an hour ago. Now I'm looking for an axe. I think it's silly getting mad at a waiter. You haven't by any chance found an answer to that question, have you? What question? How a smart guy like me happened to marry a dumb cluck like you? I don't think there is any explanation. That's what I thought. But you did like my dancing. Oh, did I? All right, let's try that. Oh, don't be silly, Bill. You couldn't dance these modern dances. Not at your age. Oh, not at my age. Maybe I'm too old for you? I wouldn't want a younger man. I don't know why we come to these places anyhow. I do. I like to dance. That's a good idea. Come on. Oh, but I just promised this dance to Walter. Didn't I, Walter? Oh, yes, of course you did. Say, who's engaged to her anyhow? Oh, don't be so jealous, Jerry. All right, Bill. What are you trying to do? But this isn't one of the new dances. Sure you can do it? Well, if you didn't want to dance with me, why did you ask me? Well then, I'll dance by myself. That's my little gentleman. Did you bring it? Yes, it's right here. Well, how am I doing for an old man? Now don't you be nervous, Bill. You just follow me. I'm sorry, I should have brought my running shoes. New step. I don't have to say thank you, do I? Not to me. Applaud, Bill. What have I got to applaud? You want to dance again, don't you? This time we do it my way. Well, what now? Oh, you'll have to excuse me. Are you finished, monsieur? I certainly am. I've taken about all I can stand for one evening. Hey, listen, never mind the rest of the dinner. Just bring me something to drink. Champagne. The best champagne and one glass. Yes, but madame? One glass. Yes, sir, one glass. Good night. Good evening, Miss Calhoun. Good evening, Mr. Shane. So nice to see you. I didn't dare hope it'd be so soon. What's that? Champagne. Where's my glass? Hmm, I only ordered one. Not a taste even? Ah, here she is now. About time. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. I just told him I didn't mind letting him have my girl, but I thought he ought to return her. Did you think I was lost? Well, it wouldn't be the first time he lost you. What do you mean by that? Walter. Walter... I'll tell you what I mean by that. I'm engaged to Anne now, and I'll kill the first man that horns in. It's all right, gentlemen. It's just my wife. Well, why didn't you pick me up, you big lummox? I picked you up once and now look at me. Are you hurt? No. Everything is under control. I'm sorry to have intruded. Please go on with your quarreling. I thought I married a gentleman. Well, live and learn. Anyway, it serves you right for snooping into other people's affairs. I haven't snooped. You have, too. You've been snooping all evening. You're just a snoop poopity-popp, that's what you are. Of all the selfish, beastly pigs I ever met in my life, Bill Reardon, you are about the lowest form of... Hello, Reardon. Hello, Schuster. How are you? Who's that? There you go snooping again. What's it to you? His name's Schuster. I know his name's Schuster. What does he do? What difference does it make what he does? He's a lawyer. What kind of a lawyer? What difference does it make what kind of a lawyer? He's a divorce lawyer. Wait a minute. I want to see that guy. Get me two bottles of this and one glass. Oui, madame. What did the lawyer say then? Well, in New York State the grounds are desertion, insanity, and a couple of other things. In California, it's mental cruelty. What's mental cruelty? Refusing to dance with your husband when he wants to dance, dancing with him when he doesn't want to dance, snooping. Snooping when he doesn't want to dance and dancing when he doesn't want to snoop. Yeah. In Russia, the man gets the alimony. Oh, let's go to Russia. All right, Sally, let's go to Russia. Waiter. Time table. Where is our waiter? Sally. Oh. Sally! I tell you what. What? Let's go to bed. That's a very smart idea. How did you ever think of that idea? It just came to me. Do you really think that's a good idea, or are you just saying it? Oh, no, I really think it's wonderful. You know, I get a lot of good ideas, but I'm afraid to mention 'em. You shouldn't be afraid, Bill. If you can't tell your wife, who can you tell? I could tell my mother. A boy's best friend's his mother. There you go sticking up for your mother, instead of your own flesh and blood. Come on, let's go to bed. I've got to get up early for the DA. And I've got to get up early for my office. I know what. I'll get us some hot milk. That'll make us sleep. There's just nothing... There's nothing in the world like hot milk. Bill. Bill. Bill! Huh? What? If I get you some hot milk, you'll go right to sleep. Leave me alone. Hot milk is the only thing. Say, how do you expect to go to sleep with that tight collar on? What's going on? I'm just trying to put you to sleep, honey. There must be something I can do for poor little Bill. I know. Bill! Might have turned off the alarm before he left. Bill! Wake up, Bill, it's late. Poor Bill. Oh, poor Sally. Walter Fraser. I'll kill the first guy that horns in. I'll kill the first guy that horns in. I'll kill the first guy that horns... I'm sorry, Bill, but business is business. Mmm. Hello. Dispatch? Give me the City Desk. City desk. Good morning. Could I interest you in the Fraser murder? You might. Why? Did you kill him? No! But I think I know who did. Sally Reardon of the Reardon Detective Agency, you know. No, I don't know, but go ahead. Eh? What? Say that again. 63rd Street. We'll be right over. Fine. That's great. Stay right where you are. And you say Marlowe made this threat in the presence of witnesses? My husband and I both heard him. Where is your husband? He's down at the DA's office covering the case from their angle. How did Marlowe look when he said it? Don't quote me, but he had a very ominous glitter in his eye. And you were close enough to see this ominous glitter in his eye? Yes, I was. My back was right toward him. Marlowe would have killed Fraser right then and there if I hadn't stopped him. How could you stop him? Well, I threw a chair at Marlowe just as he was getting ready to draw his gun. Interesting, if true. Don't forget to put in the Reardon Detective Agency gave you your clue. Publicity helps, you know. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's not fair. He has no pants on. Hey, give me that plate. Come on, Joe. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. What happened? What's going on? Oh, Bill, you haven't got your pants on. What was that noise? What was that noise? Oh, you finally heard something, did you? I've been slamming in and out doors all morning trying to wake you up. You were supposed to be down at the District Attorney's. Do you know what time it is? Ow. Bill, are you all right? Yeah, yeah, get me a clean pair of socks, will you, Sally? And bring me the morning paper. Oh. There isn't any. What, no clean socks? No. No paper. You see, the boy forgot it this morning or else the neighbors stole it again. Let me help you with your socks. Bill, do you love me? Yeah, only don't ask me in the morning. No, I mean really love, no matter what happens? Sure, sure. And no picture could ever come between us? And no picture... Say, what's the matter with you? Are you crazy? What picture? Well, any picture. You know, like when you and I go to the movies and we see a picture, and I like it and you don't and you make an awful fuss. Oh, let me alone, will you? Here I am trying to get to the DA's office on time and here you are bothering me about a moving picture and can it ever come between us. Hello. Yeah. What? Holy smoke. Yeah, yeah. I'll be right down. Say, Sally, you know that party that were sitting right next to us in the cafe? Yeah. One of them was a guy named Fraser. He was murdered last night. No. Yeah. Bill, this is your chance. You pick up the trail from the time they left the restaurant to Marlowe's house. Oh, that's all I got to do, eh? We can break this case in no time. If we solve it before election, we'll be heroes. If we don't... I know. If we don't, I'm the goat. Oh, I wouldn't say that. I know you wouldn't say it. Now, suppose a miracle occurs and I do crack this case. Do you think you might mention me in one of those interviews? Save it, Bill. I'll give you all the publicity in the world. Yeah, well, I never got it before. Hey, wait a minute. You've got it now. What? "No picture can ever come between us." Who's your tailor, Reardon? "Blonde Sleuth accuses Marlowe." Why should I hire anybody who says that? So she'll stop saying it. I don't want any part of it. Say, who's the lawyer here, you or I? You made the threat, didn't you? Yes, I made the threat, but I didn't kill him. Well, whether you did or not is unimportant. The important thing is to make sure that you're not convicted. - Yes? - Mrs. Reardon is here. Send her right in. Now you be nice to her. Nice to her? I'd like to kill her. That's the sort of talk that got you into trouble before. Mrs. Reardon. How do you do, Mr. Ketterling? How are you, Mrs. Reardon? You know Mr. Marlowe? Oh, yes, we met last night, didn't we? Won't you sit down. Thank you. Mrs. Reardon, I have explained to Mr. Marlowe that you've agreed to do a little investigating for us. Yes, I have. Of course, we're very busy at the office right now, but this is such an interesting case, I felt I couldn't afford to turn it down. It is interesting, isn't it, Mr. Marlowe? That's very generous of you, Mrs. Reardon. Isn't it, Jerry? Oh, yes, it's very generous. Oh, well, money isn't everything. We agreed upon 200 a week and expenses, didn't we? Oh yes, yes. I have your check all ready for you, Mrs. Reardon. No, wait a minute. How are you going to fix that newspaper story? Oh, that. May I use the telephone? Sure. Thank you. Don't you worry about a thing. I can fix it. Hello, give me the City Desk. Hello, this is Mrs. Reardon. Yes, I have a new story for you. Have you a pencil ready? All right. "Marlowe is innocent" says blonde investigator. What? I know I said he was guilty, but I've just picked up some new evidence. Hello, Bill. Oh, it's dark isn't it? Oh, that one's on. There you are, honey. What about this? Bill, you promised that no picture would ever come between us. Yes, but I never said anything about shorts. Well, anyway, it shows you have nice straight legs. Never mind my legs. Why did you repeat that crack of Marlowe's to the reporters? Well, I told you I was going to get publicity for the office, and anyway, Marlowe did say it. He was drunk. I always tell the truth when I'm... When I've had a few drinks. If you do, it's the only time. Yes, it's very obvious. If you're going to kill someone, you don't advertise it, do you? Have you had any dinner? No, I don't want any dinner. Maybe you'd feel better if you had something to eat. I'd feel better if I murdered you. Making a monkey out of me with the DA. I'm sorry, Bill. I won't butt in again, really I won't. If I thought you meant that, I'd be the happiest guy in the world. Oh, I do mean it, Bill, honest I do. Okay. Okay, you can live. If you really mean it. Of course, I mean it. I appreciate how you feel, Sally, but it's a man's place to make the money for the house and the woman's place to take care of the man when he comes home. Oh, you're absolutely right, Bill, and to prove it I'll make you the best supper you ever had. How do you like your coffee, weak or strong? Strong. I got things to do tonight. What things? I thought you were going to do the housework. Well, a wife ought to take some interest in what her husband is doing, don't you think? No. Well, if that's the way you feel about it, all right. Are you and the DA going to arrest anyone tonight? No, we're not going to arrest anyone tonight. We don't arrest people on a lot of flimsy evidence, and we don't accuse them till we are pretty sure they're guilty. Oh, I think that's a very nice attitude, Bill, but don't forget to question the butler. What butler? I don't know. All I know is that when I read a detective story there's always a butler. Open the sardines, Bill. Butlers. I thought you were going to take care of the housework. Hurry up, will you? I've got a date with the DA. We are going to re-enact the murder tonight. Ow! Oh, Bill, did you hurt yourself? No, I just lost a hand. Oh, well, do be careful. Where are you going to re-enact the crime? In Central Park. Oh, that's very silly. You ought to re-enact it where the crime was committed. Oh, don't, that's the last can. It might be easy enough for anyone to get up on this terrace from the other building. Yeah, but the doors were locked from the inside. The glass isn't shattered. So it couldn't have been done from here. There's Mrs. Fraser. Oh, you can't go in there. Isn't this the Marlowe apartment? That's right. Well, I have to take this in to Mr. Reardon. It's very important. I'm from the District Attorney's office. Well, just a minute. I'll take it to him. You wait here. What I want to find out is just where each person was when the shot was fired. What about you, Miss Calhoun? I was in the kitchen mixing a drink. Where did you last see Mr. Fraser? Here, in the living room. It's true, isn't it, that you were once engaged to Mr. Fraser? Yes, I was. And now you're engaged to Mr. Marlowe? Yes. What of it? Nothing, only I may have to dig into these relationships. So if I ask a few personal questions, it won't be out of idle curiosity. Where were you, Mrs. Fraser, when the shot was fired? I was in the library. I was just reaching for the phone when... That's all right. How about you, Marlowe? Frankly, I'd had a few drinks. I couldn't swear just where I was. Why, Jerry, you were in the kitchen with me. But, Jerry. Yes, Mrs. Fraser? Nothing. But you were about to say something. Well, Jerry had walked through the living room with me to show me where the phone was. The shot came almost immediately and I didn't think he'd had time to get back to the kitchen. He'd just come back when the shot was fired. Well, what about it, Marlowe? I really don't remember. Nobody seems to remember much around here. Mr. Reardon, a lady brought this. Huh? She's waiting for an answer. No answer. What are you two talking about? Is it against the law for me to give an order to my butler? Where were you last night? I was asleep. The shot awakened me. I put on my bathrobe and I... I came down. How long have you worked for Mr. Marlowe? I engaged him in London two years ago. Let him talk for himself. Who did you work for before Marlowe hired you? For a Dr. Murray. There is nothing wrong with your memory now, is there? You might try remembering a few things about last night. I'll take another look around. I'll see what I can do. You know Jerry's innocent. I know only one thing, that Walter is dead. I have been all over this place, too. That gun ain't nowhere in here. It's got to be someplace. I looked in there. I think I've found the gun. What are you talking about? You just don't know where to look. What a place for a gun. I just found something. Where did you locate it? Sit down. In the butler's pantry. Take this downtown for fingerprints. Yes, sir. Well, how do you account for that? I don't know, sir. Ever handle a gun? No, sir. Oh, you say you never shot a gun? No, sir. Well, here's your first lesson. Shoot this. Oh, no, sir, I wouldn't know how. I... I couldn't. Just pull the trigger. So you never shot a gun before? No, sir. But you knew enough to release the safety catch before you pulled the trigger. Take him downtown. You can't do that. Are you trying to hang this on him? Oh, do you want to go along? You bet I do! Fine. It might help you to remember where you were when that shot was fired. It's all right, darling. That's all for the present. We're very grateful to you, Mrs. Fraser. I hope we won't have to bother you again. Will it be all right if I go away for a few days? Certainly, as long as we know where you are. Miss Calhoun, we'll get in touch with you when we need you. I'd like to go away for a few days myself. No, I think you'd better stay in town, Miss Calhoun. Very well. Whatever made you think of the butler? Whatever made me think of the butler? Why, I suspected him from the very first moment. Stop that! How did the gun get in the butler's pantry? I don't know. But you were the only person who cleaned the pantry. Never mind, we don't have to ask him any more questions. All we need now is a confirmation of the facts we have. On the 2nd of this month, you went to a pawn shop located at 374 Hillcrest Drive, Newark. No, no. You bought a revolver there for $15. No, I didn't. The pawnbrokers identified your photograph. It's a frame-up! But before you bought the gun you examined several rifles. I didn't. He tried to sell me a rifle... Oh! I thought you'd walk into that. Okay, let's have it. Come on, you've admitted you were there. Come clean. I bought the gun for Mr. Marlowe. You mean to say Marlowe sent you to a pawn shop? No. He gave me $20.00 to buy a gun. Oh, I see. He gave you $20 to buy a gun and you only paid $15 for it. You chiseled him out of $5. Well, I hid the gun for him, didn't... All right. Now let's have it step by step. After I bought the gun, Mr. Marlowe kept it in a drawer in his room. About a week ago the gun was missing. Did you say anything to Marlowe about it? No, I didn't think it was any of my business. Go on. Well, when the shot was fired, I put on my bathrobe and rushed down. Fraser's body was lying on the ground. A woman was screaming and Mr. Marlowe... Yeah. Tell us about Mr. Marlowe. Oh, he was trying to keep the ladies quiet. Then I saw a gun lying by the French window. The gun you bought from the pawn shop? Yes. I picked it up, slipped it into my bathrobe and I hid it in the pantry. Marlowe asked you to hide it? No. Now, what did he say when you told him where it was? I didn't tell him. A three year old child could make up a better story. And you expect me to believe that? I don't care what you believe. It's the truth. I did have Grigson buy a gun and it disappeared about a week ago. Oh, the gun just walked out of the desk, eh? I don't know what happened to it. Did you ask Grigson about it? No. When I saw it missing I was glad. Oh. And why were you glad? Because I was afraid I might use it on Fraser. You bought it to use on Fraser, didn't you? Yes. Why? Because he was up to something with Anne. And she'd been writing to him. How do you know she'd been writing to him? I was in his apartment when the maid brought the mail in. I know Anne's handwriting. He didn't open the letter, he just looked confused and slipped it in his pocket. Any idea what it was all about? No. She denied everything. He lied. I was going crazy, I tell you. I'd have killed him all right. I'm only sorry I didn't. Cheer up, Marlowe. Maybe we can prove you did. Will you please tell the District Attorney that Mrs. Reardon is here. Sorry, he's busy. You'll have to wait. How do you do, Mrs. Reardon? Oh, Mr. Shane. Well. And what is a night club owner doing in the District Attorney's office, if I may ask? Oh, I get around. Oh, you're not complaining about my husband's check, I hope? Oh, no, that hasn't bounced yet. Well, that won't be a bounce, that'll be an earthquake. What might you be doing in the District Attorney's office, if I may ask? Some new clue on the Fraser murder? Say, maybe you could help me. Well, I'd appreciate the opportunity. What was in that letter that Anne Calhoun gave you the other night? Letter that Anne Calhoun gave me? Oh, Shane, I'm sorry I won't be able to see you. When I called you the other night, you told me to be sure and drop in to see you this morning. I know, I know. That was before the Fraser case turned up. Come and see me next week sometime.Okay. I'll tell you what, I'll call you when I'm ready for you. Okay. Goodbye, Mrs. Reardon. Goodbye, Mr. Shane. Think it over. Mrs. Reardon. Oh, I'd like to talk to you. I've got some very valuable clues. Yes, I've been reading all about your clues. But this is a new one. Well, tell it to your husband. Maybe he'll listen. It's no use. He isn't speaking to me these days. Smart fellow, Reardon. I think Shane is mixed up in this case. Shane? Nonsense. But you... As it happens, I was talking to Shane over the telephone just about the time the murder was committed. What do you think he was doing, holding a revolver in one hand, and a receiver in the other? Maybe he's a ventriloquist. A ventriloquist? Hello, Mr. Ketterling. I have some marvelous news for you. I tried to get you earlier, and then later I was busy myself. Uh-huh. Shopping. What? The good news? Oh, well, it isn't exactly good. No, it looks pretty bad for poor Mr. Marlowe. But don't you worry. I have a wonderful plan. If I can get rid of my husband by 8 o'clock, I'm starting out and... Huh? Well, I can't tell you. No, because I'm not sure what the plan is. Bye, Mr. Ketterling. Bill! Bill. Bill, darling. Bill, darling, speak to me. All right, you little double-crosser. Why you... You acrobat! Ow! Wait a minute now, I can explain everything. You were doing so well with the case that I... Well, I just got so discouraged I hid in the closet. You heard that phone call? I heard part of it. I wasn't interested much. You weren't interested much? No, when a man discovers that his wife's been double-crossing him, nothing she can say is of any interest to him. Anyway, there's been a man from headquarters listening in, taking down the full conversation. You mean, these wires have been tapped? Hello, Mike, did you get it? Okay. Well, then you know everything. Oh, no, no, I'm not that good. But I know Ketterling and Marlowe hired you. How did you find out? Oh, well even a boob would get suspicious of his wife when he finds her giving out interviews, sneaking around when he's trying to question people and behaving in general like a madwoman. Besides, I'm the smartest detective in town. You said so yourself, remember? Of course, that was before you began to think you were the smartest detective in town. Anyhow, I got some clients. One client. A potential murderer. How do you know I haven't got more? Because nobody would hire you except somebody who wanted to spy on the DA's office. Is that so? To me, the most convincing proof that Marlowe is guilty is the fact that he hired you. Only a desperate man would do that. But he's not guilty. That's what you think. But of course, you're paid to think that. He has his man buy a gun in order to kill Fraser and Fraser's killed. That adds up, doesn't it? No, it doesn't add up. Someone stole that gun a week ago. Yeah, that's what he says. I can prove it. If you do, you're a better man than I am, Gunga Din. If I do prove it will you take orders from a better man? Sure. I know when I'm licked. All right. You quit the DA's office and I'll give you a job with the Reardon Detective Agency at a big salary. And if you're licked, will you go home and look after the kids? It's a bet. What kids? Oh, I'm sorry. A woman with a career wouldn't have time to bring up a lot of children, but if you ever decide to give up that career, Mrs. Sherlock Holmes, come up and see me, we'll have a nice, long chat. Oh, I suppose it's only fair to warn you that wherever you go tonight, you'll be shadowed by one of my men. Oh, that's not fair, Bill. All's fair in love and war. Well, this is war in a way, isn't it? Mmm-hmm. I guess it must be love too, otherwise I'd have killed you long ago. So long, dangerous. Bill. Yeah? Doesn't this remind you of those Civil War stories where the Northern captain falls in love with the beautiful Southern spy? Well, I think it's romantic. Gee, we sure miss Mr. Fraser around here. Oh, I'm awfully sorry, Mrs. Fraser. Stick 'em up. One move and I'll plug you. Let me go, please. I didn't know anyone else was in here. You think you'll ever leave this room alive? I'm married to the greatest detective in the world. He'll track you down to the ends of the earth. You mean Bill Reardon? Bill! Oh, I was never so glad to see anyone in all my life. It's lucky for you I was here or that fellow would have plugged you. Oh, my legs are shaking. I was really scared. What are you doing in that get up? I'm a lone widow who forgot her keys. Plain idiot who lost her brains. Oh, these widow's weeds are hot. I hope, darling, I never lose you in the summer time. Oh, any other season, I suppose, would be okay. It would be much more comfortable. I know what! Shh. We'll do our searching together. If you find a clue you tell me and if I find a clue I'll tell... I know if you find a clue you'll tell the newspapers. You nit wit, I believe you'd answer it. Maybe it's a clue. Mrs. Fraser's stockings aren't any better than mine. Are you searching or sightseeing? This is the kind she wears all right. "Love's Temptation No. 5". Oh, you get me some for my birthday, Bill. It's only $25 an ounce. Hey, come out of there, you thief. I thought it was a wall safe. What are you hiding from me? Shh. Good evening. Don't touch me or I'll shoot. Oh, my letter. Give it to me. It's mine. Sally, Sally, come back here! Never mind. I'll get that later. Sit down, please. Do you want to tell me about it? No, you wouldn't believe me anyhow. Maybe not. I'll tell you what I do believe. I believe that you wrote Fraser a blackmailing letter. Blackmail? And when he wouldn't be blackmailed, you killed him. No. No. Oh, yes, you did. No! I'll tell you. All right. You might as well tell me the truth. I'll find out anyway. I was desperate. I had lost $2,000 at roulette. Roulette? Where? At Shane's place across the river. And I gave him a bad check for it. So I wrote to Walter asking him for old times' sake to lend me the $2,000. And he did? Yes. If that was all, why did you take your life in your hands and steal in here? Because I thought Lola would find the letter and give it to the papers. I didn't want Jerry to find out. Can't you understand that? Are you sure Jerry doesn't know and suspect the worst? You're trying to trap me into saying he killed him. He didn't. He didn't. If anybody did it was Lola. She was jealous. She... Oh, I don't know what I'm saying. Oh, yes, you do. I'm afraid I'll have to place you under arrest, Miss Calhoun. You can't. You've got nothing to arrest me for. Have you a permit to carry this gun? No. Then I can hold you on the Sullivan act. Oh, no, no, no. That's better than suspicion of murder, isn't it? Oh, hello, Bill, home so early? For the last time, are you going to give me that letter? What letter? All right, boys, get to work. Rip the place wide open. Bill Reardon, I won't allow strange men to search my apartment. I know my rights. You don't know anything. I thought you'd pull some cockeyed idea like that, so to save an argument I brought along a search warrant. Oh, it's pretty. Will you autograph it for me? Fogerty, take the kitchen. Flannigan, the bedroom. Be sure and put everything back where you found it. Empty everything in the place, including the garbage can. Aw, I wish I'd known you were coming. I just emptied it. All right, off with you. That's a fine way to treat my husband. Boo! What are you looking for? A letter. Imagine a big man like you wanting to play Post Office. You're getting warm, Mr. Flannigan. Am I? Mmm-hmm. Warmer. Warmer still. Hot, very hot, red hot. Cold. You're getting warm again. Warmer, hot, hot, cold, cold. Ice cold. Well, now am I getting hot? Just under the collar. Go on. Listen, don't pay any attention to what she says. Just search every inch of this place. You play by yourself. I'm busy. Hello, Mike, are you there? Oh, you aren't there. You old faker. I thought you said this wire was tapped. Hello 376, I'd like to make an appointment to see you. Well, if it's about that other matter, just forget it, won't you, and keep the money. Oh, but this is very important. Just a moment. Who is it? Oh, it's that dumb Reardon woman. You see, I'm not seeing many people these days. I've just come across a letter that I'm sure will interest you. See her. Find out what's it about. Well, I'm going out, but I'll be back about nine o'clock. Will that be all right? Nine o'clock is fine. I'll be there. Goodbye. Hey, Flannigan, I'll finish in here. I want to keep an eye on her. I can tell when she gets nervous. How you doin', honey? Mr. Flannigan, you're still cold. All right, it's your turn. You want me to help search? Oh, no, you're going to be searched. Oh, Bill, you wouldn't dare. All right, if you'd rather have the boys do it. Oh, Bill! Take your shoes off. Bill, stop it. Don't you dare! I haven't any letter on me. It would rustle. Bill, don't take any more off me. Don't you dare take another thing off. Bill, listen. Bill, you old meanie. Give me that search warrant. I'm gonna take it home and read it. I've been here four hours and we still haven't decided when I get the 50 grand. I can't pay you until the estate is settled, can I? The question is, will you pay me then? I'll pay you, all right. I know I'll get my money. Listen, if the police ever found out that your husband was writing out checks to Anne Calhoun and that you knew about it, they might even suspect you of the murder. And if they ever found out that I left you to marry Walter, they might even suspect you. Who's the man? I don't know, but that voice sounds familiar. What are you sticking around for? She'll be here any minute. Watch your step and don't say anything to the Reardon lady, because if you even say hello to her that dame thinks she has a clue. The wrong clue, but a clue. Whoever the guy is he certainly knows my wife. Good evening, Mrs. Fraser. Good evening. Sit down please. Thank you. You said something about a letter. Yes. A letter that Anne Calhoun wrote to your husband. Even if it meant finding the murderer, I wouldn't want anything cheap to be printed about Walter. Well, I know how you feel, but see for yourself. At least we'll find out what Anne Calhoun wrote.Yeah. Oh, Mrs. Fraser, you had no right to destroy that. I'm sorry, Mrs. Reardon, but I can't have any slurs on Walter's memory. Don't you want your husband avenged? Yes, I want him avenged, but I don't want his name dragged through the mud. Well, that just means I'll have to find another clue, that's all, but don't you worry, Mrs. Fraser, I get one a minute. Perhaps I can give you a very good clue. Wait a minute. I wonder how a smart girl like me married such a dumb cluck as Bill Reardon. Anyway, he's got more sense than that baboon he's working for. There now, we can let our back hair down. Who planted that Dictaphone? Oh, probably that silly husband of mine. As if anyone wouldn't have sense enough to look for a Dictaphone. How long do you suppose it's been there? I haven't the faintest idea, but it looks awfully new so I guess it hasn't been used much. I don't like the silence. You sure nothing is the matter? It seems all right. I don't like it. Come on, Flannigan, let's go upstairs. I'll tell you something, but you must promise not to reveal where you got it. Why, 376, you can trust me. When I went to the phone just before the shot was fired that night, I heard someone on the line. Wrong number? No, no. Someone was in the apartment talking on the extension. Someone was talking on the phone? Well, there was no one else there but you four and the butler. The butler. I knew it was the butler all the time. No, no, it wasn't the butler. I know his voice. Well, who was it? I don't know. What was he talking about? He was talking to the District Attorney about gambling. Talking to the District Attorney about gambling? Then it was Shane. He was talking to the District Attorney at that time. He was in the apartment. I knew it was Shane all along. All right, Mrs. Fraser, get your things. We're taking you down to headquarters. Snooper. You can't do this to my client. Shut up. You're under arrest, too. Is this yours? You'll have every chance to explain later. Don't talk, 376. Don't talk. Now, Mrs. Fraser, we know there was a man in your apartment. Who was it? Shane, Nick Shane. Shane, huh? And he wanted $50,000, didn't he? For what? I owed it to him. You owed it to him? What for? I lost the money playing roulette. Shane had promised me that he'd... He'd give me time to pay. But when this happened he started pressing me. I couldn't give him the money. I didn't have it. Shane seems to have done all right with that joint of his. Did you know that Anne Calhoun had lost money there? Why, yes. We were there together when we both lost. And what about the remark that Shane used to be the boyfriend? It's true. I was a showgirl in Chicago then. I thought I'd left all that behind me when I married Walter. All right, Mrs. Fraser, that's all. You won't be disturbed again. I promise. Thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. Well, that seems to let her out. Whom do you suspect now? What about this guy, Shane? He keeps turning up in this case. Shane is a gambler who uses strong-arm methods to collect, they all do. Just the same, I'm not overlooking the fact that Fraser took his girl away from him. I wish somebody would do the same thing for me. What did Lola Fraser tell you after you cut that wire? It's a good reading light if I had anything to read. Oh, you're out of matches. Here's some. What did Lola Fraser tell you after you cut that wire? She made me promise not to tell anyone, so don't you repeat it. I won't. It was just by accident that she found out about it. Found out about what? Oh. Oh, no. I couldn't betray her confidence. It's my Girl Scout training. Can you tie knots? Hello, darling. You're wasting your time. What did she tell you? What did she tell you? What did she tell you? Now, Mrs. Reardon, we know Lola Fraser told you something. Ten to one it wasn't important, but if you'll just spill it we'd... Well, we can all get some sleep. Are you sleepy? Why don't you drink some strong black coffee. That clock. Bother you? No, no, I just wondered if that's the right time. I have an appointment, you know. Fogerty, will you please stop that? My, you're a nervous type, Mr. Flannigan. What you need is fresh air and exercise. Unless I can use a hose on her, I give up. She's your wife. Haven't you any influence with her? I think she'd talk if I promised to resign this job and go back to our office. Tell her you'll do it. Promise her anything. Okay. Good morning, darling. That's all, boys. Well, it's another day, isn't it? Listen, honey, I want you to try to realize how serious this is. Gosh, Bill, I love you. Listen, a man has been murdered, the killer must be found. Well, if you'd let me out maybe I could... But this is a matter for the police. Now, if you'll work with them I'll... I'll promise to take another try at that office of ours. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. Well, Lola told me that a few minutes before the shot was fired she picked up the phone. A man was talking to the District Attorney about gambling. Shane. Yes. I told that fathead boss of yours so at the beginning and he wouldn't listen to me. Bless you. Fogerty. How much does that perfume of Mrs. Fraser's cost? $25 an ounce. I'll buy you a whole gallon of it. Keep her here, Fogerty. I'm coming, too. Hang on to her! Lola Fraser overheard your conversation with Shane on the Marlowe telephone. But you checked on their phone, no calls came out of there. I know there's no record of it. I don't know where Shane phoned from or how the wires got crossed, but I do know that call was planned in advance as an alibi. That means Shane is the killer. That's what your wife said. Well, even so it might be true. Goodbye, angel. Keep her locked up before she gets another clue. I like this one. Put her in a cell. It will be a pleasure. I'm sure Mr. Shane didn't come in at all last night. Give me the key. You wait here. Send out a call to have Shane picked up. I'll take a look around. Yes, sir. Mrs. Reardon. Well, what are they going to do to me now? It's Mr. Ketterling. He's arranged for your release. Calling all cars. Calling all cars. Arrest Nick Shane, wanted for murder. Description, 40 years, dark complexion, slight build, armed and desperate, take no chances. Well, keep on ringing. How long ago was Mrs. Reardon released? About a half an hour ago. Ketterling showed up with a writ of habeas corpus. Well, take a man with you and get over to the Reardon apartment right away. Yes, sir. And send another man over to Shane's hotel to warn Bill. Yes, sir. No, no, no, keep on ringing. He might answer it. Perfume. It's no use, Bill Reardon, I wouldn't forgive you for all the perfume in the world. Bill. Bill. Where are you? Bill, oh, don't hide. Where did you put the perfume? Oh, quit horsing around will you, once is... Break it in. It's Nick Shane. I'm glad you're doing a little investigating around here. It's been awful lonesome. Yeah. Hold that. What's that? It's a handy little instrument for unlocking doors. It works. Give me that. What are you going to do now? Try to find out where Shane telephoned the DA from. I found it. Perfume. I guess this guy got what was coming to him. We got orders to keep you right here. I'm weak in the knees. Don't faint, lady. Smelling salts in the bathroom, will you help me? Oh, sure. Of course. Certainly. Please. Oh, excuse me. Are you all right, lady? What's the trouble, Mrs. Reardon? Oh hello. It's nothing. Um, uh, how's the baby? Oh, just fine. He's got a tooth. Oh, swell. Are you by any chance going down Park Avenue near 54th Street? Well, it's a little bit off our beat. But seeing it's you. Thank you. Everything's dead around here anyway. I'm calling the DA's private wire. Will he be surprised. Hello. Hello, chief. Listen, I think I've busted the Fraser murder wide open. Yeah. I got Shane right where we want him. I think I know who hired him to do the job, too. I bet you can't guess where I'm phoning from. No, I can't, but you'd better get home. Shane was just found murdered in your apartment. What? Well, where's Sally? Where's my wife? The police have her in your apartment. Hey, where are you going? Thanks a million. You don't know what you've done for me. Okay, Mrs. Reardon. Any time. There's one fine little woman. I want to see Mrs. Fraser. I'm sorry, she isn't in. I'll wait. Who is it, Mary? Mrs. Fraser is packing up to go away. She can't see anyone. Just tell her it's Mrs. Reardon. She'll see me. I'm sorry, Mrs. Reardon, but I'm terribly busy. This won't take a minute. It's very embarrassing when a client commits a murder, especially when they think I did it. What are you talking about? Nick Shane. Why'd you kill him? Are you crazy? You don't seem very surprised that he's dead. As a matter of fact, I'm not. He was always being threatened. People were afraid of him and hated him. And you hated and feared him, too, didn't you? Yes, I did, but I didn't kill him. Where did you get that? I'm sorry, Mrs. Fraser. I found it beside the body. All right, I did kill him. Now don't you worry, we'll plead insanity. Yes, sir, that Mrs. Reardon is one wonderful little lady. You bet she is. That Reardon is a lucky guy. You know, if I wasn't married so happy, I... Calling all cars. Be on the lookout for Mrs. Sally Reardon. Height five feet, three inches, weight 110 pounds, complexion blonde, suspicion of murder. Pick her up, bring her in. If you wasn't married so happy... Hey, Bill, your missus is up at Park Avenue and 54th Street. How do you know? We took her up there. That's Lola Fraser's place. That crazy kid'll get herself pumped full of holes. Step on it. Come on, get back. All right, and don't forget my picture on the front page. Yes, I have an awfully cute one in a bathing suit. Any time. Goodbye. Sally, are you all right? Of course. Here's her confession. But she did it in self-defense. She came to my apartment to see me with no intention of killing anyone. She was minding her own business, but this fellow Shane came along and made an awful row because she told me that he was guilty. Then he pulled a knife on her and the first thing you know, one thing led to another and here it is in the confession. See? And you are dope enough to believe all that? I'm ready. Ready for what? Ready for the truth? Walter Fraser wanted to divorce you, his lawyer is willing to swear to that, but you weren't willing to accept the settlement he offered. You knew as his widow you could get a lot more than that, so you offered Shane $50,000 to kill him. That was a gambling debt. Yeah, that's what you told me before, but Shane's books show that you never lost over $200 at roulette. Then after Shane had killed him, he began threatening you, pressing you for the money. You realized that $50,000 was just the beginning so you deliberately killed him. Take her away. Wow, what a client. Listen, honey, how did you happen to suspect her in the first place? Yes, do you mind telling an old baboon? Well, when I got home the apartment was still full of her perfume. Then when I accused her and she didn't ask how or when he was killed, I knew she'd done it. And you managed to get a confession with no more than that to go on? Well, I pretended I'd found her handkerchief beside the body. Where did you find it? Right here in her grip. There are a lot of them, see? Mr. Reardon, how about one with your pants on? Sure. So it was the widow, eh? Yes, yes, I suspected her at first. That is, Mr. Reardon here had traced a previous connection with Shane, so he and Mrs. Reardon had... What are you signing? I'm going to get $500 for the story. For this story? No, the love life of a girl detective. Bill, don't be angry. I wasn't going to give them any of the real inside dope.
