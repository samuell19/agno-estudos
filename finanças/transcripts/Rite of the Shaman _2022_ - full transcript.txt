Kai? Kai, is that you son? Thank you. Thank you. Welcome home son. How was school today? Ah, I see that smile on your face. You went up the mountains. So tell me, did you see anything wonderful? Ah, the Great Lady was surveying her domain. Ah... I miss the sound of your-- of your voice my son. Don't look sad. Remember, everybody grieves in their own way. And losing your father and your grandfather is an awful lot for any heart to carry. Remember, the doctor said that you will find your voice. And when you're ready, I can't wait to hear it. But I will admit, I listen to your voice all the time. You do sound like a five-year-old in my mind, but you know, that's... I wonder what your voice sounds like. I'll bet it's rich and deep like your father's. I miss him. Do you remember all of the hikes that we would take? Do you remember when we would go up the mountains just to get away from the things of men? I remember... your little legs would be trying so hard to keep up and you just couldn't do it. You would reach your arms up to us. We would lift you up on our shoulders. I miss those hikes, all of the adventures. Do you remember the things that your father would talk to us about? All about balance, all about nature. We had some really good times, didn't we? But the one who really-- understood that was your grandfather, Ronan. I swear he knew every tree and rock by name. And he was on a first-name basis with all of the animals. Isn't she beautiful? In your mother's native language of Gaelic, she is called. She represents wisdom, and she helps us to find those hidden truths and bring them to light. In my heritage, my Viking heritage, she is called ugla. She helps us see in the spiritual dark. Hey, all done with homework? Uh, yeah, I just finished up the English essay and now I'm going to finish up this biology thing. -Do you need any help or...? -Nope. Kai helped me. Okay. Well, I'm gonna head to bed. -Don't stay up too late. -Okay. -Okay. Goodnight. -Goodnight. Haley! Hey, Haley. See what I did there? Uh, welcome. Glad you could make it. Um, vascular plant. All right. So this date's back about 420 million years, okay. So it's been around for a while. Um, vascular plants, have-- they have a built in transportation system, all right? So they're really good at-- at, uh, conducting energy and bringing fluid and transporting nutrients. They even actually will, uh, enlist like other organisms, which sounds really gross, but... okay. So they're amazingly resourceful. Okay, so... dermal is like the skin, right? And vascular is like... the veins. So ground is like the fat cells? Cool. Who knows what chlorophyll is? - Plant's food. - Kind of. So chlorophyll is, um, you can buy it at that health food store. Like, uh, it's like that green disgusting drink. You guys know what I'm talking about? Don't know if your parents ever make you drink it. Uh, yeah, go ahead. Hey, guys, I will be in my office Tuesday, not Wednesday. Just review the, uh, study material, okay? I promise it's not that hard, but-- Hey Kai, can you hold back just one sec? Are you planning on doing the science fair? Yeah? Okay. They got a really good scholarship opportunity and I actually signed this already for you. So-- see you, John, sorry. Um, um, I hope you'll- I hope you'll do it. It'd be good for you. Sorry, Brian, um-- You gonna ask me if I'm gonna do the science fair? Yeah, absolutely. Um, but on that note, like, man, what's going on with your grades? ♪ A tender and kindling the log of the evening ♪ ♪ A bird to the night ♪ ♪ And the mind at the darkness hour ♪ ♪ In search of the spark so bright and alive ♪ ♪ Where the root and the stem ♪ ♪ The leaf in a house of green ♪ Well, if it isn't Dr. Kai Leigh.

All right, let's go have a talk. - You need a walk, boy? - Hi. The mute freak. Probably can't hear me either. Kai. Hold up a sec. So where's the snake? Didn't it need a walk too? Man, my mom said you used to be able to talk. Ah, seem a little broken though, huh? Losing your dad and grandpa do that to you? Man, that must have done a number on you boy. Hi, defective. Maybe your daddy was a snake. Come on boys. Let's go. Life is not easy. We must all work hard to support one another and support our world. That is life and life is connection. Life is a circle. From dust we come and to dust we will go. So Kai, how was your day today? You didn't go to the mountains, did you? Of course, I can tell. You seem off. Is everything okay? Sorry. Sorry. I'll back off. You know, Kai, I heard a story once about a carrot, an egg, and a tea leaf. Well, they were each gathered by the farmer and each of them saw the farmer set the fire, put the pot on the fire, and put the water in the pot. As they watched that water begin to boil, the carrot was unafraid. Fruit was strong and it knew that its strength would protect it from this challenge. The egg knew that it was soft and tender inside, but it counted on its shell to protect it from the challenge. The tea leaf, the tea leaf was flexible and it knew it would face this challenge. And into the water went all of them. What do you think happened when they came out of that water? Did the carrot's strength protect it? That carrot came out and all of its strength had been sapped out of it from that challenge. And it was weak and mushy. What about the egg? When that egg was opened up, that once soft interior was now hardened by that challenge. But what about that tea leaf? What happened with it? The tea leaf did something completely unique. It changed the water and it turned it into tea. I don't know what challenges you're facing right now, but you have to decide what are you. Are you a carrot that's going to trust your strength and then be weakened by the challenge? Are you gonna be the egg and have your tender heart absolutely hardened by it? Or are you gonna be the tea leaf and change the world? You are acting as the sacred fire keeper tonight. So you are responsible for this space and for the fire. Kai, the native people of this land and your ancestors have great wisdom in their love and respect for nature. And we are wise if we learn from them and listen. I miss your father too. I feel all those same things. And it is okay to feel the things you feel. It is okay to cry. Your mind and heart are so heavy. Let them rest, breathe in the air and let go. Feel the earth beneath you. Listen closely and hear nature's voice singing. In many cultures around the world people use dance to express feelings that are too deep for words. Dance lets us connect to ourselves and the earth in special ways. It doesn't change the world, but it lets us clear our hearts. Yeah, your worthless kid. -My kid. -Your, your worthless kid. -My worthless. -He can't even mow this lawn. If you want him to grow up an emotional cripple, go ahead and keep coddling him then. I am not coddling him. He'll- he'll be fine. He'll get his grades up. Of course, yeah. You say this every year. Every year. He should just quit and get a job. At least then he'd be doing something useful. No. No. This is the year he will find his path. -I know he will. -Yeah. -This... Is hard for me. -Really. Really? Yeah. Yeah. You know, you're always make excuses for him. He's just a kid. He has challenges. He's just learning. -I'm supposed to be his dad. -Yeah. So yeah. So I should have some say in this too. -You should. -Yeah. And-- But you don't act like a dad. When have you ever listened to him? -When have you ever? -I try. I-- I try. -I try. -No, you've not. He treats me worse than he treats you. He shows me no respect at all. If I'd treated my dad that way he would have kicked out. -Your dad. -Yeah, my dad. Great. Yeah, let's talk about your dad. No, you have never once done anything to earn his respect. Why should he respect you? Hey, I want my dinner ready when I get back, okay? This is hot garbage. It's so sad. All right guys. So yesterday we were talking about cell structure. Now, I know you all found that incredibly exciting. Um, but today we're gonna be moving into DNA. Okay. Um, who knows what DNA stands for? Go ahead. Um, deoxyribonucleic acid. Deoxyribonucleic acid. Yeah. So, uh, we're actually gonna be extracting DNA from a strawberry. Um, we're not cloning to dinosaurs, I'm sorry. It's not as-- not that exciting, but um, you're gonna be doing the same extraction process that they do in labs and everything. How this works is we take what's called saline solution and this is just soap and saltwater. And what it actually does is it's gonna break down the cell wall and once that's broken down, you can actually go in and extract the DNA. Okay. Um, the salt is kind of important. This is on the quiz too. So write this down, whatever. Um, it will actually pull out the, uh, the- Or provides, I'm sorry. Provides a positive light, okay. And that allows them to pull out the negative DNA out of the solution once you've completed this. So, uh, you all have your instructions. It's all pretty straightforward. But if you have questions, please ask. Okay? Oh, Kai. Thank you for dinner. Sit down, sit down. How was your day? Everything all right? Kai, what's going on? Hey, listen. There's gonna be a really cool show on later. Do you wanna watch it with me? It's about plants in the Amazon. Kai, I'm worried about you. Oh, Kai. Kai, I love you. Okay. So I think I finally understand, do you think they're gonna make us like dissect a frog or something? God, how cool would that be? I mean, what do you think the inside of it looks like? Maybe we could look-- look at its brains. Do you think it looks like a human brain, all the ridges and everything? Because I think it would be quite similar because I heard that frogs are really intelligent. -So I was thinking-- - Kai, let's have a talk. Don't you know you're just petty case, just a project for her? What do you see in this freak, Aspen? You know, he's a real retard, right? Just don't listen to them. Oh hell, um. Let's go, Smily. Both of you. That's twice this week. Let's go. Both of you now. Office. Kai, you watch your back. Kai! Kai! Yeah, no, honestly, I'm just a little worried about him. He seems kind of withdrawn and his grades just are- they're not good. Um, he was actually supposed to come meet with- you know what, he actually just walked in. Okay. Yep. I- I'll let him know. Bye. Hey, Kai. Mom wants to talk. How are you doing? No. Hey, man I wasn't trying to bother her. We were just -- Look I'm-- I'm just concerned about you. I'll just say it. Um, you know, the work you're doing it's-- it's not your best. And-- Okay. That-- that's fine. Um, at the end of the day, you still have to do the work just like everyone else, you know? Are you-- Look, are you sure there's nothing else going on? You can tell me. Kai. Kai, come on. What's up? It seems there's been an allegation against you. And because of the seriousness of the allegation, I'm afraid I needed to contact the union. So you're going to have a representative and a lawyer come here and I need to know if you wanna come speak with-- What allegation? I'm so sorry. We'll discuss it all in the principal's office, but you need to come with me right now. Somebody will come in and take care of your class. Okay. You just-- Let's sit down there. I'm so sorry. Dr. Leigh, we haven't seen you for a while. How have you been? Hey, how's your-- how's your mom? Uh, uh, okay. I'll ring you up. So I was wondering if I could get your help with one of our middle Middlemist rose, red roses? I-- It's just that you're- it's just you're so good at it. Um, is there anything I can do for you, Kai? Hey, Kai hold up. Look, I'm-- I'm sorry I-- I'm concerned about you. I-- I-- It's just really you haven't been yours-- Bills, bills, bills. It's okay. I can just get a third or maybe even a fourth job. Hell, I could just work all the time. That boy, if he isn't gonna graduate, he should work too. Someone's gotta pay the bills around here. Knock it off, Al. I don't know why it happened. I don't know what happened. It just happened. Just it doesn't help to get mad about it. Do not tell me how to feel in my own home. I can't work any harder than I do. It's the government's fault. No. Would you please stop blaming them? Everyone thinks you're crazy when you say that. -Don't call me crazy. -Mm. So, so no, I'm just on probation until the end of the year. And it-- it all came from that one anonymous review, but I don't know. The-- the school's just doing it to cover themselves and the district. I mean, of course, they are, right? But I don't know. I feel like a criminal. I didn't do anything wrong. Wait, how can they do that? It's based on rumor and hearsay. It's just crazy. I mean, I know that you give everything to those students. Do you know who could've done it? No, I have no idea. Come in. I'm okay. I'm okay. Listen to your ancestors, Kai. They live within you. The souls of Shaman from thousands of generations whisper to you. Let them guide you claim your right. Kai! Oh, Kai. Kai. Kai, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I know you found my papers. I'm trying to fix it. I'll fix it I promise. I was so scared. I thought I lost you forever. I thought you've run away. Kai, I know things are hard right now. And I can't fix them the way I want to. And I can't promise that it'll be better soon, but it will get better. Kai, darling. Please live. Please let me help you get the help you need. Okay? Oh, just hold my hands, son. -Please just hold my hands. -Mama. Oh, Kai. Kai. You just made a s-- -Did you just speak? -I love you, mama. Oh, Kai. You found your voice. What will you do with it? Yeah, we won! All right, man. Good job, buddy. Yeah. All right. Whoa! Hey, freak. Did you put any of these on my locker? Freak, you put this on my locker? -Yeah. -Talking now. Hey, freak-- Kai... why? Because it's true. Um... Uh, it's actually really cool. Uh, could I help with that? Thanks. Hey, what's yours say? -Um, says you are bright. -Nice. And you? - Mine says you are ready. - What's your say? I'm, uh, I'm worth fighting for. -That's cool. -Um, here. For you. Y'all have a good day. Hey, Mr. Dewitt. Hey Bryan. What's up? I didn't call for you, did I? - No, this was my idea. - Oh, yeah. I was gonna say, 'cause I don't-- There's no-- there's no report for you so Ms. Anderson, -didn't kick you out again. -No, this-- this is my idea. Are you saving the school officer sometime today or what's up? What's going on? It's shocking but last time I was in here you said that there was still a chance I could graduate. -Really? -I mean it, yeah. Yes. You're pretty far off track for graduation though. Okay. Now, Bryan, I'm gonna tell you it's not gonna be easy. Uh, now it's gonna take a lot of hard work and no joke, commitment from you. -Gimme those. -Sorry, Mr. Dewitt. I've seen a lot of students in your situation and they quit because they can't meet all the requirements. My-- my mom and my dad, they didn't graduate high school. They haven't gone to college. Quitting is no longer an option. I wanna walk. Good. Let's work on this pack, okay? Okay. So first I'm gonna need you to get your teachers to sign these letters. I'm gonna print 'em out for you. -Okay? -Okay. Now what? You are loved. Hmm. All right. You're way too old to be like that. No, if I say no, the answer is no. Go get in the car. No, leave your shoes on. Today not worse. Are you kidding? Kids, can we start over? Let's go home. Hey, um... I don't-- There's really nothing I can say but these flowers aren't nearly as beautiful as you are. -Thank you, honey. -Yeah. Work on some of these bills together before they come and get everything. Oh, and you know, Bryan, he really is a good kid. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna do better. I, uh, I'm gonna try a little harder. Both of you. I got a lot of stuff that are-- I gotta work on myself. And none of its either of you guys' faults. -I love you. -I love you too. If this has a nucleus, then what type of cell is it not? Uh, that is not nucleus? These are the ones that do have them. So like bacteria, for example, right? Always think about that. So a cell in your body, right? They're all gonna have the nucleus whereas like something like bacteria is not, right? So something-- All cells photosynthesize, right? We-- Yeah. But that's kind of the different-- that's-- that's going back to the lesson we talking before, this is more focused on what's gonna be coming up. ♪ I came here for you ♪ Is this even worth it at this point? No, here-- Okay. Now you're making me feel bad. It's kind of a trick question. You were right. Look, viruses contain DNA, but not much else. So you not remembering is actually a good thing. -Oh, okay! -Let's put that one right! See it does. No, you're fine though. But seriously, that-- that was the question. Wendy is the best employee I've ever seen. She deserves a bonus and a promotion. She encourages me to learn about plants and challenges me to bring them back to life. Congratulations, Sunny. Looks like you guys are having a good time over here. -How was everything? -Great. How about some dessert, huh? Keep those smiles going. We have a beautiful peanut butter cheesecake and our chef did an absolutely amazing tiramisu this evening. -What do you think? -Let's do both of them. -Both? -Yeah. You know, what, tonight it's on the house. -Hey, thanks. -Yeah, of course. Well, you guys, I love you so much. Love you. So I just-- all I have to do is get my GED, and then I can get some more promotions. And then I can-- They said they might help with college. I might get some help. Hey, Aspen. Look, I'm so sorry. Everyone looks so chipper, please. My goodness. Sorry, Mr. B. My gift to you. Hope it's a gift. Three, two, one... What? No way. Yeah, let's go. I mean, it's not all of it. It's far from all of it, but that's a C. That's a C. See you Mr. B. I gotta go. Hello, Dr. Petin. This is Rebekah Leigh. I've just decided I'm not quite ready to give up. Next week. I'll see you then. Getting into multicellular organisms. These are all developed from single cell. Okay. This is very common in all kind of cellular reactions. It comes from, uh-- It's called a zygote. This comes from the Greek word yolk and-- and it's called a zygote. Hey Mrs. Shelley, what's up? I'm sorry for the interruption, Mr. Browning but I wanted to come share the news with you and celebrate with your students. -Congratulations. -For what?
