So, when I talked it over with Jessi Dean, she seemed more or less on board with how the trapeze girls could update those bodysuit things. She was all for getting rid of tours, as well. She also brought up changing the final act, but I think it's super solid. Your grandmother actually came up with a lot of that routine. So I think it -- it only makes sense to keep it. I mean, I guess. But wouldn't changing that jazz up next season like you want? Well, maybe they can upgrade or refine the opening act. What I couldn't believe it, though, surprisingly, she suggested that we change up our routine, which is just ridiculous. I mean, it's outdated, though, and, like, more for little kids. Shouldn't we be trying to appeal to more people? These acts have been the forefront of our circus for generations. To change our act would be -- it would be a betrayal. Okay, I think that's, like, a little dramatic. [Dark] Dramatic? Not dramatic. No, no. I'm not about to change the magic show that made this circus what it is today. Okay, I really don't think that's saying much, though, because the circus is barely making enough money to stay afloat. It's not my fault that circus isn't bringing as many people as it used to. Well, times have changed. Okay, so then shouldn't the circus change with the times? [ Dark sighs ] How should I say? Uh... People come to the circus to escape the times. If we modernize, it's -- Okay, look, you're talking as if working harder to improve the circus would ruin it somehow. Okay, we should be trying to draw the crowds in.

It seems like you're a baseball champion. More like baseball participant, but... -I see. -Champion has a nice ring to it. So let's go with that. Let's -- Let's do that. So, it seems like you have it all figured out, huh? I don't know what gave you that impression. Well, I mean, it's just that... I don't know, you have your own place, right? -Yeah. -It's kind of like having -a little piece of the world. -But I don't know if that means I have it all figured out, though.

So, I was thinking, like, Southern California, basically. [Drew] I always thought the Pacific Northwest was really nice. [Poppy] Nah. Too much rain. [Drew] Okay, if you have a problem with rain, then you have a problem with pretty much everywhere outside of Southern California. [Poppy] Basically just the West Coast, right? I mean, I kind of like your hometown. -Like, right out there? -[Poppy] Right out there. It's actually been one of my favorite places to visit. [Drew] I guess it's not half bad. [Poppy] No, it's not. [Drew] I got to meet you. I've always wondered about this wanderlust kind of fantastical lifestyle, you know? You're treating them like novelties. I mean... I'm not. I'm just curious. You know, like, to me, it's a whole nother world. Mm, not really. [Vanessa] I guess I'm trying to say, like, your way of life is... different. You know, like... Old-fashioned? Is that the right word? Nostalgic sounds better. I think our lives are pretty normal. I mean, we do the same things other people do -- [Vanessa] Antiquated! No, that sounds too similar to old-fashioned. We're not preserved in some ancient time bubble. We're aware of how the world works and we live in it fine. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ But like, what about education? Do you guys get homeschooled? Or can you even get a formal education because you travel around so much? -We're homeschooled. -We go to school. [ Vanessa chuckles ] Um, I'm sorry I'm asking so many questions, but it's just so interesting to me, you know? Like, what about this -- Do you guys make your own money or is it like a collective pool of funds, like a stipend? What about that? ♪♪ ♪♪ Okay. Wait, wait, wait. Aren't we, like, technically at a dinner party you're hosting? -Um... -[Poppy] With people? [ Drew sighs ] [Drew] With people. Um... My friends, your friends. Yeah. Those guys.

It's -- It's fine. -Okay. -Okay. You know, I wonder if there's like a freelance healthcare worker for, like, circus people. Like, I'm sure there is, but you would definitely have to research the right one, right? Can we, like, change the subject or something? -Lala, that's rude. -I'm sorry, but I just... I would rather talk about anything else. I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you or anything. I'm not offended. I just don't want to be treated like some novelty. Your friend said that earlier, and it makes sense. [Poppy] Lala. [ Ballgame continues indistinctly on TV ] Okay, so, tour's done. What are we doing? Just talking about our day jobs. You didn't miss too much. Oh, really? Sounds like I missed a lot. 'Cause I personally would love to know the ins and outs of what you two do at the circus every day. -Dear Lord. -What about the circus? Oh, uh, Vanessa was just asking us questions about... our lives and stuff. -It was fine. -What's up with the attitude? [Drew] She wants to work in education, so you could see why she wants to know the differences between circus life and normal life. Normal life? N-Normal probably isn't the right choice of words. I think circus life is normal. Same here. I'm sure he just meant how it's different than how most people live. It's not that different. Honestly, it kind of sounds similar to like when people join the army, you know? Like, they live in their own little bubbles, like literally on a base, and even though soldiers get offered things like formal education completely paid for after they leave services, a lot of them still struggle with things like their mental issues -- or, mm, I'm sorry, "issues" really isn't a nice word -- um, PTSD, stuff like that, you know? I'm not saying that anyone from the circus would have that, but surely there are some comparisons to, like, how life exists for a person after they've left a certain lifestyle that they've grown accustomed to. You know, like -- like how it happens in cults all the time, too. We're not a cult. You mean how would they function in society when the one that they're leaving is completely different? Yeah, you get what I'm saying, Drew. More or less. Are you asking how we'd live our lives if we didn't live in the circus? Yeah, pretty much. Well, I mean, who knows, right? I just think it would be super interesting to see how, like, the general health and, like, education circumstances growing up in, like, a really sheltered circus community would affect somebody living in today's society. [Sadie] I don't know who you could talk to, but I'm sure you can find someone. Actually, I've been thinking about leaving the circus for a while now. It's probably just a matter of time, you know, trying to find the right moment, so... maybe in a couple of months you could ask me. -Are you serious? -Really? How interesting. I'm confused. [ Sighs ] Yeah, Sadie, I've been -- I've been thinking about it for a while now. Thinking about what? What's happening? Like leaving? Yeah, I mean, when I talked to Lala about it -- -Wait, you knew about this? -Don't drag me into it. I'm just trying to be honest with her. And we did talk about it, and I was -- [Lala] Yes, and you told me not to tell her. Yeah, because I thought she would react this way. Maybe she's reacting this way because you dropped the news like a bomb a second ago. I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding. It's not. Honestly, I'm acting how anyone would act given the situation. -Can we just calm down first? -When did you decide this? Were you even planning on telling me? What, were you just gonna leave in the middle of the night and think you didn't need to say goodbye? -Does Dark know? -Look, I'll tell you everything -- [Sadie] Then tell me! [Poppy] Um, maybe we should go. [ Scoffs ] Maybe we should go. And you can stay here and do whatever it is you were doing with Drew for the last 25 freaking minutes. Come on, Lala, we're going. I'm so sorry. Wait, guys, can't we talk about this when we get home? -Maybe Drew can -- -No! -[Poppy] Why not? -I said no, Poppy. But I don't have that much money left for -- [Lala] I do. It's fine. -Look, I'm sorry. -Don't lie. -Sorry for what? -[Poppy] I'm not lying! You could have said something sooner. And now what? I'm leaving with my parents in a few days. And you're just not gonna be here when I get back? You're just abandoning us just like th-- I'm not abandoning you. And you trusted Lala, but not me. I've known you longer. I know.
