That's the three-ruble place! - Are we in Moscow? - Yes. - Hello. - Good day. - Is that another century? - Why? No, the same. It is the same Moscow, only in another world. - Take a photo! - All right. Second. In this world There is neither oil nor natural gas. There are no wars or revolutions.

We were afraid. - My name is Konstantin. That means as much as "the constant". But you can call me Kotja. Take off your clothes. They are full of blood. That happens to me quite often lately. Slowly I get used to it. - What? - Just a scratch. You are as good as cured. The closer a functional reaches the limit of its capacity, the faster the process of its regeneration. - the main thing he gets water. - And what is your function? I have to stay here. In the "White Rose". Are you really 160 years old? I am 27. I received the rites at the age of 27. And that's how old I stay forever. Just like you. Your bathtub is ready. Your things are again as good as new. OK. Thank you. I remember on my first days here. I was alone and was scared. - Soon you will make this world yours. - And if I liked mine? - I did not want to go here. - Neither do I. But now I live in my perfect world. Yes, but what does your perfect world have to do with me? Everyone has their mission. The curators have been watching us. When we were ready, they assigned us our tasks.

That depends on different factors. Now it is 15 kilometers. - How many? - 15. That's a premium range for a beginner. But you have two doors open. This is what we call "the leash". A leash? What if I Must leave Moscow? When do you have that last time done? Does it matter? What if I want? You should not try that. It would kill you. There are a lot of worlds out there. Open the doors and travel. On a leash? For your information: I was against the fight test in the "White Rose". - But the curator insisted on it. - Who is the curator? We have to go! Rosa is organizing tomorrow a party for you. This is tradition here. For the inner circle. You will meet new people. They will like you. I have been for two years not on vacation!

But now they are gone. I know some of your books. That over the Middle Ages was very interesting. "The middle age in Russian history "? Thank you. Many Thanks. What are you researching about? I think, Historians underestimate the meaning of chance as a driving force in history. What would have happened if Sophia Peter killed the Great? Interesting. Or if Lenin's nanny stifled him in the cradle? Interesting. Yes, I also had some time with me of alternative history. Read this, if you have time. Thank you very much. Shall we be with ours toast a charming guest? We are now... - over 25 years together. - I had no choice. He drove away all the worshipers. - You had to fight for your love? - The whole campus was my opponent. Where are we at the Driving forces of history are ... There are two driving forces in this world. The quest for power and the pursuit of women. Today we praise the women. I was lucky. I found my wife and won her heart. I wish you the same. THE BRANCHES OF THE PAST Good evening. I hope we do not disturb. - no. - Anna. Anton Vladimirovich said They had something new to show. Come. Have fun. Here you go. Incredible! My God! - A dream come true! - Wonderful. Anton is with you immediately. What the... - What's this? - That's the requirement of the regulation. I need patronymic names from you, Age, position and employer. Anton Belezki, 37, in the public sector. Your marital status? - Divorced. - How do you know your fellow travelers? Ah, is it about her? We checked her. - She is one of us. - Do you have an affair? Why, Mr. Zöllner? Answer the question. What do you have with her? Nothing. At the moment. Come here! This is more beautiful than any pool! - Knock Knock! - You? Yes I. Do you have an appointment? Actually, I wanted to ask if you would go out with me. But to be honest, I can not talk with you Drive weekend to St. Petersburg. I have to stay with the tower. I can do it do not imagine my friends because I'm out of her memory was deleted. Although I would like that very much. But you can also change the situation look at it differently. For example... Anna, I have the door to the reserve opened, because I thought of you. Do you understand? Kirill. Did we know each other sooner? Yes. I knew it. Kirill! Hello. Will not take long, okay? Kotja. Can I talk to you? Now listen. Can you come back tomorrow? I have just made an appointment. Pink Davidovna! He comes! Lisa. Kirill. Finally our guest of honor is here! They are very fresh picked from the tree. Anna, I'll show you our dressing room, with a wonderful mirror. Why did you bring her? I'm jealous. Very funny! Why can you do the past do not rest? Listen. Anna is not past. - That's why. - Let's get started. Dear friend, I want you introduce our new colleague. He heads the twelfth Moscow Customs Office. Kirill Maximov. People dress so boring in your world. - How so? - Everything is gray. - Really? - no elegance. You should have fun fall in love with someone You like it Anton Vladimirovich, right? May I help you. There was still something missing jewelry. By the way, Kirill is a functional. I want to toast with the genius. With pleasure. Cheers. - Do you like modern art? - I guess so. - Then come to my gallery. - With pleasure. I want a few things to introduce from antiquity. We'll talk about it later. Do you get married with you too? I've never heard that before. We are immortal. One hundred or even a thousand years I would be too much with the same man. And functional can not have children. - You did not know that. - Rosa. The cook asks for you. Think about it. Did she make you sad? Is it true that Functional have no children? Yes. We are not humans. Lisa. Did you see Anna? No. Kirill? - Kirill. What is your patronymic? - Danilovich. Kirill Danilovich. Where exactly is your customs office? At Bolotnaya Square, next to the bridge. My restaurant is located on the Chistoprudni. You are welcome everytime. Everyone knows the "Rogow". You have to visit me. - With pleasure. - I serve mushroom and fish cookies. I expect you there! - Felix. - Kirill. I was also a master once. In the first week I opened four doors 24 in the first month. But you are even better, you genius. - I was written off. - Why? I have been feeling for several years empty inside. I do not care. But a publican becomes his driven by internal resources. His feelings, Thoughts and wishes. That gives a drive, and new doors open easily. Everyone praises you. You are a star. New worlds are highly regarded. It was 28 for me. The rest is crap. Nobody ever goes there. What is it for you then? Looks, as if it were about Arkan. - Everyone always talks about Arcane. - But nobody has ever been there. Most consider it a legend. Would you...? And that you can not go there. But I believe that Arkan exists and the rest of the world rules. How does Arkan do that through closed doors? There are the curators for that. Each of us has one. But you want that do not get to know each other. Can one refuse his function? You can free yourself from the leash. But most functional, who tried ... have lost their identity. There are special camps for rebels in some worlds. Already for this conversation we could land there. Especially for freeing yourself from the leash. Do you want to try it? - Do you want to play? - no. He belongs here. But not you. They think, I should rather go? That would be better. And the right thing. Here you go. How do you recognize his curator? Guys? Why so serious? I explain to him just the rules of the game. Felix, do not be an egotist. Everyone wants to get to know Kirill. It was a pleasure. You are the coolest publican, I know. Where is Anna? She's gone. She knows she not heard here. Kirill, heard me the "New Faces" magazine. we want you on the cover. - For this we would have to take pictures. - All right. - And one more thing. - That's enough. Kirill, come and visit me. I am happy to see you again. Thank you. We have to do something. Already initiated. Anna! Wait! Wait! Anna. Do not go! Before it is too late! Let me go. You're welcome. Here you go. Good evening. Anton Vladimirovich sends me to pick you up. Oh, you. Good evening. I have read your file. You are a good person. - You are passionate. - Which file? I have it for me Borrowed from Renata. She had no choice because of the agreement. In a week you will be different. And I have this transformation already witnessed But you still have time to change that. And work as a parking attendant? Let's stay serious. You need to open the door to Arkan. Where are we driving to? I want to go home. So it's not a legend. Yes, for 60 years have been the doors to Arkan no longer open. On no customs office. There was only one portal to Arkan, at that time during Soviet times. In the area around Orenburg. But Khrushchev believed the reactionary forces in Arkan would gain in power. And he decided to intervene. Excuse me. - Kirill, one more minute. This is important. - I'll be right back. ANNA - LOST CALL Forgiveness. they have one Nuclear blow carried out. The portal closed, there was nothing left but a bomb crater. In the archives is this use as Training maneuver from Totsky listed. All documents were kept secret. ANNA Please stop. I want to exit. The participant is not available ... - Arcane? - is exactly like our world. But they are us about 30 years ahead. We can do it as a draft for our own world. We can learn from their mistakes To avoid conflicts and disasters. You can leave our world make the final version, Kirill. But I can do the worlds not open on request. Why are you so sure? Can you do it do not just try? In order. I'll try it. Excuse me. You're welcome! Stop! Be quiet. The participant is not available. Please try at a later time again. ANNA'S HOUSE The participant is not available. Please try ... It is a body part. An arm holding the part. Archaeologists have it recently found in the canyon world. Somewhere near from your Novosibirsk. We checked everything. You can report that they were aliens. - That will please NASA. - How should it continue? - Can the impact be prevented? - no. - Can you save the people? - No chance. The participant is not available. Please try at a later time again. And one more thing: Anna is gone. What does that mean? She was a threat. You exceed your powers. I'm not yours. You are my functional. You owe your career to me. Do not make each other any problems. Sign it. The keys. Fast. We test the equipment. Distance: 15 kilometers. Back! They serve me now. - Water! - Did you get it? Nod, if so. Water. Where is Anna?

So, on you! - Do you smell the pollen? - He is everywhere here. I know. He does not harm the functionals. But from the others he makes zombies. Why are you staying here, when they feel bad? In the beginning, they feel bad. Then they get used to it and love the pollen. - Oh yes? - And the pollen makes you happy. I run a kind of sanatorium here. If someone something forbidden says or do something, that violates the rules, you send him to me. Is this a special camp? A gulag? Do not look down on us. People feel comfortable here. I'm not good at it, To create worlds. One is burning hot, the other ice cold. Here I always have enough vegetables. Nirvana is not suitable for life. It is a prison. Therefore, visit me never anyone here. Hey, Goalkeeper, Are you ready for the fight? You are the sentry at the gate. Imagine there is a borderline, right behind you.

We'll do that later. - Get out! - I have a question. Say, neighbor. Can you appeal? to hold a talk? I could ... you to introduce to the people. OK. Even cabbage has to drink, otherwise he will dry up. For the benefit! In order. Let's go to the appeal. Enjoyed! another day happy work has passed.

Our heroine and the mother of this world. Let's live it up! Come here! We let them live! Is not worth mentioning. Stay where you are! Stop! Where do you want to go? She is out of place here! Where do you want to go? Let her live! Long live Vasilisa! No way! This is my world. And my people. - All good. - And she's mine too. Roger that? You can be functional Let people in and out. I ask you, let us go. You fool. The withdrawal will kill her. But here she always gets be happy and satisfied. No. Too bad that me must lose a neighbor. You wanted it like this. Can we solve it differently? I can not let you go. That would not please the curator. And with the curator you do not dress! Let go! Here she is! Stands still! Long live Vasilisa! Hooray! Hooray! Some things never change, Kirill. If you want, that something happens ... then you should do something. - You are the curator. - Right. Kotja the curator. I thought, you would find out sooner. You tried, tear the leash. A nice knife. A gift from Vasilisa? I also have one of her. That's for you have kidnapped a prisoner. You have to understand, Kirill. You will stay here, until I let you go. No more games. Now I am the genius. And you are my servant. What is the range? 50 meters. I forgive you the attack on the curator. Water. That's your world. Here you will feel better. - Only peacock feathers today. - I'm sorry. I have closed. - Why? When do you open again? - Never again. I COME BACK. HAVE NO FEAR! Welcome to Arkan, Kirill Danilovich. We are in Arkan? Yes, that's Arkan. Incidentally, my name is Kirill. Kirill Alexandrovich. Let's go for a walk. I would like to invite you to a beer. Does your visit have something to do with today's date? - What is today's date? - Today is June 22, 1941. As? Here it is 1941? That day in your world raided Hitler the Soviet Union. - And with you? - Here he lives in Vienna. He paints landscapes because he is on time was warned about his future. Impressive. Then your world lags behind me? Time already. But in everything else we are ahead of you. Let's go along here. Attention. OK. Just try. My favorite brand. The recipe comes from the Han Dynasty. We have nothing like that. This will remain so. Are you also a functional? More than that. We are colleagues. I was also a publican and I have Beria and Stalin led to other worlds. But then, in 1954, according to your time, became the communist party here banned and built borders. That did not please your world. We never had war. We did not let the troops in. But my customs office was destroyed. By a nuclear bomb. Does that mean you the years were sealed off? No. They were cordoned off, not us. Arkan has created other worlds, and Arkan controls her. We use their knowledge and lead there even through historical experiments. Is our world for you only a test lab? Exactly. A blueprint. All your wars, epidemics and catastrophes happen only so that we can avoid them here. Pretty clever! Where are everyone going? - You do not want to disturb. - How so? We do not want any illegals here! Thanks, Kirill Alexandrovich. If you go to Vienna, say Hitler, he should stay in Arkan, far from my world. I go home. No. You are not allowed to do that. Have been walking? - Where is Anna? - Search for her. Anna! Where is she? I sent her away. Where? Tell me! Tell me! They attack a customs officer! I will destroy you! I'm commanding the tower now. But not about me. Bring Anna back, then I will go. - I appeal to you as a human! - But I'm not a human. Thank you for reminding me. You fool. The curator will come ... and fix everything. Yes Mama? Hello. Yes I'm fine. And you? I am overwhelmed with work. Yes, that works. I'll come over tonight. See you. Are you here, too? to kill me? I should do that. Give me the. Without the door I will never find Anna again. Listen to me. Portals are closed. Worlds disappear. Arkan is out of reach now. I need you, you genius. Our world is also in danger. Wait! Renata has Anna sent to another world. I have to find her. I want a door! Some functioning portal. I travel through. Where can you go? No more trips for you. You are the strongest functional any times. I do not care. Let's visit Felix in Sokolniki. You have to understand, you can not find Anna without saving this world. Kotja! Why did you wear glasses? I do not know. The girls are on it. Let's go?
