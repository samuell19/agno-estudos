Can I bring someone? What, like a date? Like a friend. Sure. I don't see why not. Who is it? The guy who forgot his assistant's birthday. Ohh! Marc. Uh, coming! I hope you don't mind me stopping by. I got your address from your paperwork. Anna, are you down here? Anna? Hey. Hi. So this is where you live? Yeah. Uh... Forgot to mention that I live in my sister's basement. It's not that bad. It's cute. It's cozy. - You're close to family. - Mm-hmm. - Are these all yours? - Yep. Wow. Wow. Did you paint this? It's really good. Oh, that was just for fun. For fun? Look at the details. It's incredible. When we were little, there was this farm right outside of the city that my parents used to take me and my sister to to go to see Santa every year, take pictures and drink warm apple cider, eat homemade donuts by the fire. I just always thought... that's the way Christmas should be. You've got talent, Anna. Thanks. But that's not exactly what I wanna be known for. Are you sure? Because I think you captured something really beautiful here. The reason why I'm here... Did we forget someone's present? Actually, I added some gifts to the list. Oh. This year, it looks like I may be spending Christmas with my family for the first time in a long time, and being that it's all your fault... Oh, hey, now. I could really use your help getting my family Christmas gifts. Can you ice skate? Three months of lessons... when I was nine. Perfect. I'll pick you up Saturday at 11. Okay. They're nice work.

So are you gonna introduce us to your friend? Oh, yeah. Eric, Yvonne, Jackson, Cooper, this is Anna, my friend. - Hi. - Does she help you skate? Uh, well, actually, I'm the one who's out of practice. I haven't been on the ice since I was about your age. Well, I can definitely help you with that. I just might take you up on that. But you need skates first. Oh, well, then why don't you show me where I can get them? Sure. Where'd you get that hat? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ Careful. Don't worry, you'll be fine. - Well? - What? You're gonna leave her to fend for herself with the boys? What about you? Are you coming? Of course. Gotta show you how it's done, like when we were kids. - Come skate with me. - Be careful with Uncle Marc. Yeah, he sits in an office all day. He probably doesn't exercise much. Let's take off. Come on. I've got ya. He's so good with the boys, huh? Oh, yeah. I'm getting close. I'm getting close. They must be looking forward to Christmas. They are. It used to be blocks and toy trains, and now it's iPads and Xboxes and whatever. What about you? Is there anything special that you want for Christmas? Honestly? I just want the whole family to be together for Christmas. The whole family! I'm right on your tail. I'm right on your tail. Well, maybe it will be different this year. Hey! Whoa! I can't believe you won! How about we go again? In a minute. I better check on Anna. You're just afraid I'll beat you again. That too. You're really good. Oh, I used to play hockey in high school. Did you? I can tell. How about a little hot chocolate break? - Watch the skaters. - Go with Daddy. Careful now. Do you wanna go for a lap? Sure. Just take my hand. Here we go. I got you. We'll go nice and slow, nice and slow. Here. There you go. Perfect. You got it. How you doing? Good? I think I'm getting it. I think you are too. There you go. You got it! Come to me. Come to me.

I'm not that over-the-top. Someone should make that Ferrari. How cool would that be? Oh, that's so beautiful. I'd better take this. Okay. Hi, Mom. Hi, honey. I know how busy you are, so I'll, um, cut to the chase. I appreciate that. I was just chatting with your sister this morning, and she told me you brought a friend to the ice rink yesterday. I guess the love of gossip didn't skip a generation. Yvonne seems to think that you and this girl had something. Mom... Yvonne seems to think she's pretty special. Well, she is pretty special. See? I knew it. Well, you have to bring her to Sunday dinner. Look, Mom... Honey, come on. You work too much. You never take any time for yourself. If you have finally found someone special, I want to meet her. I'll take that as a yes. Mom... 6:00, Sunday night. Do not be late. Yes! What is it? My mom just invited us to her house for dinner tonight. Really? Us? Well, I guess it would be the perfect opportunity to find out what everybody wants for Christmas. Really? You don't mind? No. I think it'd be fun. Great. Coming. Hi, Aunt Anna! Okay, I have a lasagna in the oven. They both had baths last night, so just skip it. Oh, Marie, I can't babysit them tonight. I have dinner with Marc's family. What? But it's the 21st. I have the mayor's Christmas party tonight. - Oh. - You forgot. Oh, I am so sorry. I guess I've just been so busy with the shopping thing, I forgot what day it was. Frankie's already there. I have to leave in 10 minutes. It's okay. I'll just call Marc and let him know that I can't make it. It's fine. There'll be plenty of other chances to meet them. - You sure? - Yeah. Oh, thank you. You are a lifesaver. You be good. Okay? Thank you. Okay, girls, go on and play. Marc, hi, it's Anna. I am so sorry to have to cancel at the absolute last minute, but I messed up. I forgot I have to babysit my nieces tonight. Well, that's okay. Why don't we just bring them? Really? Yes. My mom loves kids. Plus they can hang out with the boys. Okay. So we still on for 5:00? Sure. Great. I'll see you then. Bye. Hey, girls! Who wants to do Aunt Anna a really big favor? ♪ ♪ - Hi. - Hi. Do I look okay? I'm not sure. Oh. Uh, is something wrong? Yeah. You're missing this. - Marc! - Open it. You didn't have to. Would you just open it, please? Marc. Think of it as a token of my appreciation for all the time and effort you've put into this job. Okay. All right. Thank you. It's beautiful. Besides, we're not done shopping for my family yet, so you should get something extra out of it. Well, that is very sweet of you, but... I'm actually enjoying it. Yeah. Me too. Hey!

So, Anna, tell me, how did you and Marc meet? Funny story, actually. Marc hired me to help him... To help run the office. You know, like filing, sorting, those kind of things. Right. Lots of office work. She's also a really talented artist. She has lots of amazing paintings, all sorts of Christmas scenes and... Oh, well, those are just for fun. Most of my work is more contemporary. Honey, why don't you just stop fiddling with that thing? I wanted to get a picture since we have the whole family here, but this thing isn't working. May I? You just need to rotate it a few more... There you go. Thank you. Maybe you should ask Santa for a new camera for Christmas, hmm? And what about you? Is there anything special you want? No. I have my whole family here. I have everything in the world I could possibly want. Case in point. That is the last time the whole family sat for a portrait. And that was before Marc went off to prep school. And then there was college, career... Time just flies. Uh, don't look at that, okay? But you look so cute. That's the roast.

I'm gonna need my niece back. Oh. Right. Well... Good night. Good night. So how was last night? If I never see another chaffing dish again, it'll be too soon. Someone's in a good mood. Yeah. I guess I just got inspired. So how was dinner with the boyfriend? He's not my boyfriend. He is my client. You just had dinner with his family. That hardly falls within the job description. Look, it's okay if you like him. Hey, I think it's great. You deserve a smart, successful guy. Okay. Maybe a little. I knew it. But I'm working for him. He is my boss. For now. Nina. What a surprise. Nina and I were just discussing the situation. Look, we've worked well together for many years, so I wanted to be upfront with you. Okay. Do you know how much business we do in December alone? Actually, I do. And I'm sure you also know that several of your competitors have already made overtures to my office, trying to get our business. Nina, I know we haven't exactly hit what you're looking for. Next year's Cerulean Christmas campaign needs to be something simple but special, Marc. Something memorable. Stop trying to sell. Find me something to feel. We'll get there. I promise you. For the sake of our relationship and of the future, I hope you're right.

We spent the better part of the last three months pitching Cerulean our best ideas to no avail. You know why? They don't want our best ideas. They don't want slick ad campaigns. They don't want us to sell anything or anyone. This campaign is about feeling. Sure, they want to sell laptops, but first and foremost, they want their buyers to feel joy, goodwill towards men.

Which gave me a good idea. I think it's time... Yeah? That you and I work together on something a lot bigger than my Christmas gifts. Okay. What? Go ahead. What is that? That's the art for next year's Cerulean Digital Christmas campaign. Remember that account we were about to lose? My team and I were struggling coming up with something. Well, something wonderful to pitch to the clients. And then I remembered your painting and thought what a great way to strike an emotional chord. It's exactly what we'd been missing. You went behind my back. Anna, I sold your art as the centerpiece of one of the most prominent tech campaigns in the country. But I told you. I painted this for fun. I-I painted this for myself. Do you know how hard I've worked to get people to take me seriously as an artist? This is taking you seriously. You'd be able to get any job you wanted in the graphic design world. It's great money, great exposure, everything you've always wanted. It's always about business with you, isn't it? What are you talking about? I actually thought you had changed, that you were opening up and connecting with people, but it's always about the bottom line with you. Anna, I was trying to help you. No. You were trying to help your account. I mean, how did you even get... Marie. - Anna, please, pl... - Stop. I'm sorry. It... I just need some time to think about this. Anna, please. Just...

I called, and they said the apartment could be ready earlier, if I wanted it, so... I'm gonna move in after Christmas.

Would you like some coffee? Yeah, coffee would be great. Ooh, what's this? Hey, you two! Those go under the tree! We're opening presents as a family this year. I was hoping we might see Anna today. She's such a lovely girl. So talented too. Yeah. What's she doing for the holiday? I don't know. Honey, what happened? I don't want to talk about it. Uh, careful with that. That might be fragile.

I hope I'm not interrupting. I know it's Christmas and everything. But... I need to thank you... for believing in me and... and for helping make my dreams come true. I, uh... You're welcome. And I wanted to give you this. What? - Hi. - Hi. Oh... Actually, this is for the whole family. - Wow. Thank you. - Oh, how nice. Merry Christmas. What is it? Anna got us all a present. I wanna open it! Uh, no, no, no. Come on. We're gonna go and open it in the other room. Come on, let's go. Anna, wait. I need to apologize. No. No, it's me who should apologize. I was, um, a little dramatic. No. You had every right to be upset. I should've asked you to use your painting. I guess I just got blinded by trying to please the company, and your artwork was just so good. Anna, you have to know that I would never, ever do anything to hurt you. Doesn't mean you weren't right. Really? You gave me an amazing opportunity. I mean, not only for exposure, but also to open me up to new possibilities. Art is about creativity and being a free spirit. It's not restrictive or rigid, so why should I be? Those are certainly two words I would never use to describe you. What words would you use? Smart, thoughtful, caring, endlessly imaginative. Marc, Anna! Come see! Welcome. After speaking to each of you, there was something very specific that everyone wanted. Family. Look at it. It's... It's almost perfect. Just one thing missing. Mom, Anna did an amazing job. What could possibly be missing? Simple. Anna's not in it. Maybe next year, huh? All right, everybody, um, I think dinner's probably ready. You will join us for dinner, won't you? Of course. Good. Come on. You know, I agree with my mom. I would really like it if you were around next Christmas. You would? Yeah.
