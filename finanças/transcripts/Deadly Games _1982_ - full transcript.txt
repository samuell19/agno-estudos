[MOANING] [MOANING CONTINUES] [♪ MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] [CHUCKLES] Mm... [SNIFFS] Mm... [PHONE RINGING] Hello? [MAN] 'Linda.' Hello? 'I love that coral blouse.' [BREATHING HEAVILY] Eugh! [PHONE RINGS, LINDA GASPS] [MAN 2] 'Hello? 'Hello, Linda? 'Linda, are you there? 'Linda! 'Linda, what's going on? - 'Hello?' - Bobby? Oh, Bobby, where are you? Hey, did you just call me... a couple of minutes ago? Don't bull me! What was I wearing tonight? Just... Just answer, please. Yeah. OK. I had this strange feeling that I was being watched. But it was OK. I mean, the night, the woods... And then I slowly took off all my clothes. Oh... Well, of course I'm kidding, dummy! [CHUCKLES] Actually, I... I think the whole thing's kind of sexy. You know, someone watching me slowly undress. [HEAVY BREATHING] You're really a creep for scaring me like that. Huh? Oh, damn, I left it in the car. Do you need it tonight? [HEAVY BREATHING CONTINUES] This girl's never gonna see the morning. Hold on. [BUZZING] [BUZZING STOPS] [MOANING] [MOANING CONTINUES] [CLATTERING] No! Ugh! [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] [GASPS] Go away! Go away! Bobby! Bobby, call the police! Bobby! B...! Ugh! Stay away from me! What do you want? Do you want to rape me? It's alright, I'll make you feel real good. What do you want? [MAN] Die! Die, Linda! [SCREAMING] A carrot. Mm! Mm! Care for another? No, I think one is my limit. - [PHONE RINGS] - Ooh! Hello? Hi, Charlie! What do you mean, am I alone? It's Friday night. The night for swinging singles to howl - why would I be alone? No, I wasn't sleeping. Tom Snyder just left. Hmm! Well, it wasn't that bad. My... My step-sister? No, no, no, I'm alright. Yeah, OK. Bye. [POLICE RADIO, INDISTINCT] Normally, a fall like that wouldn't have killed her. It's how she fell. Broke her neck. I saw a hooker in 'Nam get killed like that. Big, strong guy snapped her neck. Ugh! Excuse me, could you tell me who's in charge? - You a reporter? - Uh, yes. Hey, Rog. Lots of cat food in the kitchen, but no sign of any cat. Thanks, Tom. Give me a full write-up as soon as you can, huh? - Look, uh, what's your name? - Keegan. Miss Keegan, I'm very busy, and I don't like reporters. [POLICE RADIO, INDISTINCT] How'd you get in here? Oh, well, I'm old-fashioned. I used the front door. Doors are supposed to be locked. Linda was my sister. I was kind of rude out there, wasn't I? - Yes. - I'm sorry. You have a great smile. I'm Lane, Roger Lane. Hello, Lane, Roger Lane. It was, uh... Miss Keegan? Just Keegan. You can drop the "Miss". I knew your sister. I'm sorry. [SIGHS] Yeah. I wish I knew her better. How did this happen? We just don't know. Could've had an accident, might've been a suicide. We, uh... We haven't found a note yet. Suicide? Linda? I don't think so. I don't want to alarm you, but, uh... there may have been somebody else in here with her last night. Well, what are you saying? Are you saying that this could've been a murder? I just don't know. What's a Keegan? Oh... [LAUGHS] Clarissa Jane Louise. - [LAUGHS] - Hi, Keegan. Yeah. Hi. Tell me, Lane, Roger Lane, is it alright to miss someone when they're gone, even though you didn't miss them much when they were alive? - [MAN] Hey, Roger. - Yeah? - There's a pile of cigarette butts out here. - Be right there. Yeah, I think it's OK to care. I think it's wonderful. I can't believe I told you my name. I haven't told anyone my name in ten years. I owe you one secret. [CHUCKLES] You know, you don't act much like a cop. You don't act much like a Clarissa. [COUGHING] [♪ MUSIC PLAYING] Joe, babe. Mm, I miss you. Hi, Mary. Hey, Big Joe. - Joe, hon, Chris is here. - [JOE] Hi, Chris. Ugh, what a blessing when Billy Owens took over the theater. I don't like those horror shows. My Timmy's afraid of the dark now. The real horror show is Billy Owens. Eugh, he gives me the creeps. Look, there is nothing wrong with Billy. He's just less fortunate. My friend, the bleeding heart. - Mary! - Sooty! I think she'd like to order. What's the soup of the day? Cream of antelope intestine. It's real good. Eugh, gross, Mary! I'll have a hot dog and some more coffee. Heat a rover! [HEAVY BREATHING] [COUGHING] Low-cal burger plate, a side order of spaghetti, and a Tab. [MARY] Grease one down skinny, red noodle side. Mary, why do you always call out the food in such a funny way? Well, you see, darling, we're here all day every day, and it'd get kind of boring otherwise. Kind of like having sex laying down all the time. Mm! Great hot rover. [LAUGHING] What's so funny? [CHRIS] Sooty made a joke. I make jokes all the time. I happen to be a very funny person. Uh, hey, Joe, Susan Theresa over here made a joke. No shit! [LAUGHING] Chris... You have... intracourse lying down all the time, don't you? Absolutely. Mm-hmm. Oh, good. [LAUGHS] I guess some people are a little strange. Um... - I'm gonna have... - Uh, no, no. Much better. - Oh. Um... How about this? - Good choice. - I'm Mary Adams. - Oh, hi. Keegan Lawrence. Hey, you're not the Keegan Lawrence, are you? [COUGHING] Keegan? Oh, my God! Joe! Oh, I can't believe this! - Oh, Mary Adams! - [MARY CHUCKLES] This nut belongs to you? Heart, soul, and sex on Thursdays in November. Jeez, I never would've recognized you. Look, Chris, we're all upset about what happened last night. - I just... - Let's not talk about it anymore. Christ, Linda and I went to school together since eighth grade. Isn't he the cutest thing? I love your tiny tush. [LAUGHS] Come on, sit down. You are nuts. Don't I know those ladies back there? - That's Carol Bender, isn't it? - No, Bailey. Married to Bob Bailey. And that's Chrissy Howlett, she's a little bit older than you all. She's divorced now. Bet you know her sister Annie. She lives with her. - Mm-hmm. - I like Chrissy. That leaves Sooty. Sooty's a shit. Susan Theresa Thomas was born a shit. Lane. Sooty Lane. Married about a year ago. Lane as in Roger Lane? [CAT MEOWING] [COUGHING] Here. Here we go. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's Saturday. Damn kids. Mary, would you put all this onto my account? I don't know, Sooty. Can you afford it? - Hi, Sooty. - Hello. Boy, you must really have changed, Keegan! Oh, my God! Keegan Lawrence! - Hi, Carol. Hi, Chris. - Hi. - Sooty, I met your husband today. - That's nice. Keegan, you look terrific. Doesn't she, Sooty? Mary, why don't you bring us all some coffee, so we can visit with our old friend? - OK, four coffees. - Mm! Oh, I'd love a piece of apple pie. A teeny piece. [MARY] How about a little smidge of ice cream on the side, huh? Twisted my arm. And a Tab. And put it all on my account, and add a generous tip for yourself. Sooty, I love your hair. [LAUGHS] We're all very upset about Linda. Will you be in town long? Uh... I don't know, I guess, um... I'll probably stay at the house a few days at least. Aren't you afraid? - Eugh, it would give me the creeps. - Carol! What if the murderer comes back? What murderer? You watch too much television. [CAROL] Yeah, well, you remember John O'Reaver? Well, him and Corby Phillips found a car in Turnball Woods, and there was a dead man inside with $400 in his pocket. Corby said he touched the body. Boy, the whole town was on edge. I heard the police hid in the woods for weeks waiting for the killer to come back. What does all that have to do with anything? I don't know. That murderer never returned to the scene of the crime. [ROGER] Billy! Oh, Christ, those stairs are gonna kill me. Here. Food for the cat. What's the movie? Uh, Horror of Dracula's Castle. Hey, that sounds great. Hope they choke on the cartoon. [CHUCKLING] Sorry I'm late. Hey, listen, I can get us, uh... The Monster Walks. Hey, terrific. - What night? - Monday, Tuesday. Think I'll bring someone. Who? Keegan Lawrence. You know her? Yeah, sure. Linda's sister. Kind of plump, always telling jokes. No, she's great-looking. - Yeah? - Yeah. Linda Lawrence. Gonna miss that body. You know, her house was just like Dracula's castle up on that hill. Hey, this is a great movie. Dracula's got some guy by the throat. Ever tried to strangle anybody with one hand? Huh? Ever tried to strangle anybody with one hand? It's almost impossible. Why? Cos your thumb's too weak for the rest of your hand. Look. Can't do it. The Mummy always does it one-handed. Yeah, no, here. Try it on me. Go ahead. Do it for real. No, come on, do it. Do it for real. [CHOKES, COUGHS] - It's alright! - Hey, I'm sorry. It's not you, it's this fucking asthma! You smoke too much. - I breathe too much. - [CHUCKLES] Come on. Come on, you want to finish the game? Come on, then. Alright, let's see. Where are we? You've got, uh, Mommy's Tomb, tana fluid, and the Wolfman, and I got Dr. Jekyll, Creature, Frankenstein's Castle. Alright, we're pretty even on that. It looks like you're ahead of me in the vectors. Looks like you've taken me. What's this about Keegan Lawrence? Well, I just met her. Thought you'd like her. Man, this whole town is buzzing about Linda going through that window. Suicide, huh? Nah... no way! Wow! Murder. Things are really picking up around here, aren't they? Yeah, it's a beginning. Aren't you - wait, don't tell me - the former Marge Lawrence? Yes, of course, mother of the Keegan and eastern two-blade rocking champion and perpetrator of the infamous Clarissa baby-naming hoax, for which I will forgive you. Ooh! I want this face! You look good, Mom. How's John? He's resting. It's been crowded. Yeah. I bet it was a zoo here last night. When did you get here? Yesterday morning. - I know, I should've been here last night. - Sarah Thomas baked a nice cake. - Do you want a piece? - [SCOFFS] Sarah Thomas? Mom, Sarah Thomas doesn't bake. The maid bakes the cakes. Sarah's too busy helping her daughter stick pins into idols. I hear her daughter married a handsome young man. Who, Lane? Ah, now this is a tragedy. I mean, the man is five foot four, he has big ears, fat knees, an enormous boil on his neck. Have you, um... Have you heard from Alvin Kutter lately? What's an Alvin Kutter? Ugh. No, you didn't. What's this, another of Shirley Hemphill's cousins? Well, he's a friend of their married daughter's. An Alvin yet. Oh, God, he's probably an accountant. I'm sure he uses number two pencils, probably has a small skin disorder, and writes checks with little sail boats on them. Terrific! And I'll be Keegan Kutter. Oh, God, the look. Oh! Anything but the look. Alright. I'll see him, I'll go out with him. I'll let him jump on my bones, anything you want. I'll even show him the Bavarian basket trick. You haven't been eating. Do you need any money? I miss her too, Mom. Ooh. It's just that... Cheryl Hemphill is a frump... and... it just wouldn't look good for the kid to be seen... with a frump's friend. That's good hands. Alright. Ferguson, complete to OJ at the 12-yard line. This is gonna be the last play of the ball game. Only Hendricks the Mad Stork is standing in his way. What's gonna happen, folks? What's gonna happen? He's gonna hit him. [GRUNTING] Ah! Ah, the pain! [GROANS] That, my friend, was beautiful. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] [SHOUTING CONTINUES] [CHEERING] The boys are gonna be in a foul mood tonight. What's the score? Five-two. - Who's winning? - Randy, the bad guys. [SHOUTING, CHEERING] - Alright! - Getting the lead out! There ain't no lead in that little ass. Anybody got the time? Uh, 12:45. How do you know what time it is? You see those three little piles of garbage in front of Carol? Well, I figure Carol can't go more than about 35 minutes in between meals, and we started at eleven o'clock, so it must be, uh... 12:45. M... You're crazy! [SHOUTING] I guess Sooty's not coming by. If that belonged to me, I'd sure keep a closer watch on him. Sweaty men make me real horny. Eugh, Randy! Gross! [SHOUTING] [KEEGAN] Alright, whoo! Way to go, Roger! [MARY] Nice block, cute buns. Why do they always slap each other on the rear end? - Keegan, do you know? - What? Why they always slap each other on the rear end. Oh, homosexual tendencies. I read that there's a lot of that going around. They've all got 'em. Bobby? [MARY] Hey! Hey, we're playing better now. Come on. Good play. - Hey, Mary. - Hmm? Who's that over there with the sun glasses? - Oh, that's Billy Owens. - That's Billy! Why doesn't he sit over here with us? Well, he's a loner, except for Roger. I've never seen him out of the theater except with him. Never misses a game. - Why doesn't he play? - Oh, well, he can't run. Christ, he can hardly breathe. His body's all screwed up. [KEEGAN] Oh, that's awful. [MARY] Yeah, well, they say he's lucky to be alive. Apparently, he was already half dead from a hand grenade when old golden boy fought his way in and dragged him out to a medic. Ah, shit! Ah, shit! Nice try, twinkle toes, nice try! OK, which one of you guys wants to catch one? How long have we been playing together? Two years? So, just throw me the damn ball, and we'll win the ballgame, OK? Now, snap the ball to Ken. Ken, you pitch out to Joe. Phil, you do a short down and out. Tom, you go deep to draw away the safety. I'm gonna do a down and across. Joe, see that tree over there? Just throw the ball at the tree. Don't wait for me. Just throw the ball at the tree, and I'll be there. On two. Go. [MARY] Oh, I love you, Joseph Adams. Great pass! He's crazy. Attaboy, Roger. He almost cracked his head open on that play. - Great catch, Roger. - Alright, Rog! Just like in school, man. - Hey, guys, I gotta split. - What? It's five to four - where the hell are you going? I promised Carol I'd take her shopping. Well, next week, huh? Hey, great catch, Roger. God, he's got big hands, doesn't he? Well, you know what they say - big hands, big something else. You mean... Could you imagine Joe's? Hon, I wasn't born smiling. [LAUGHING] Well, see you later, Big Joe. Man, when Roger caught that last pass, it was so beautiful, I could've kissed him. The tendencies. What can you do? [LAUGHING] Billy Owens. Keegan Lawrence. - Remember me? - [ROGER] Hey, Lawrence. Hey, hey! That was a pretty fair catch there, Lane. Don't you think, though, you could've gotten closer to the tree? Billy, you remember Keegan Smart-Ass Lawrence, don't you? I'd love to stay here and chat, but, um... I promised Mary and Joe I would meet them, so... Hey, Lane! Nice pass. I also make a pretty fair strong side safety. Nice ass. [PHONE RINGING] Ooh-ooh, ooh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! - [PHONE KEEPS RINGING] - Ooh! Wait! Oh...! Hold on! Don't hang up! Oh...! Don't...! [SCREAMS] It's probably Chris. There's a party tonight. Hello. [GASPS] Oh... oh. What you doin', lady? Nothing. Just becoming a pool flower. Here. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. How about if I grab seven or eight others and we have a wild nineway? Joseph Adams, I am shocked! Are you suggesting an orgy? Do you want me to be in the middle of an enormous flesh sandwich? Are you kidding? I'm afraid the only thing this group can manage is a little sneaky infidelity. [KEEGAN] Well, that may do. - [JOE] Now, Keegan! - [KEEGAN] Oh, now come on! You're no fun. Let's dish. Well, see the blonde by the doorway? I don't know personally, but she's been known to, uh... travel a little. - Name's Lucy. - Oh! Alright, Lucy. - [JOE] Then there's Bobby Bailey. - [KEEGAN] Oh, yes. [JOE] He definitely has wandering eyes. [KEEGAN] Does he? Watch the hands, Roger. Do you think that maybe Bobby Bailey and Juicy Lucy are an item? Well... I don't know. Oh, come on. Who? Linda? Then there's Mary Adams. Now, just occasionally, mind you, she might be found at a local disco with a wayward look in her eye. You know, thinks a guy's sexy. She'd die if she thought I knew. You're serious, aren't you? I'm not upset, Keegan. I'm in love. Who else'd marry me? Well, I would marry you. [MOANING] You look very pretty tonight. Oh! Oh, gee whiz, Rog. I guess you caught the old man with his hand in the cookie jar. It must be difficult going through life crotch first. That's a new dress. - Are you policing my lovers now, Roger? - He's pathetic. Oh, but he buys me lots of wonderful things. Where in the hell have you been for the last couple weeks? You're wearing your hair differently. It's very nice. Thank you. I'm glad you noticed, asshole. Look, what do you want anyway, cop? What do you want? Did I commit a crime? Look, I can screw whoever I want to screw. [LAUGHS] That's right, just stand there. You're a creep. You're such a creep. I don't need any more creeps in my life. I'm tired of 'em. Action's picked up a lot around here since Linda got killed. Or haven't you heard? No, you're too busy peeping in other people's windows, aren't you? That's how you get off, isn't it? Don't be crude. Oh, what's wrong? Don't you like your whores crude? You disgust me. You're a lousy lover anyway. I wish I'd never been with you or we'd made it in the first place. Yeah, just go away! Go away! Get out of here! Go screw half of the town. You and that freak friend of yours. Don't you ever talk about him again. [SOBBING] I think we can let the rest wait until morning. You guys wanna join me for a swim? No, thanks. - Thank you for all your help. - OK, darling. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight. [GASPS] Oh! [GASPING] - Coffee warm? - Yes. You look nice. You always look this good in the morning? Always. Must you put your feet on the counter? Your father called the station this morning. How many times have I asked you not to bring a gun in the house? Know what he wanted, your father? Dad. He's just concerned, like we all are. About the, uh... deaths. Killings. - Do you think it was the same person? - Murderer? Gee, I don't know, he didn't leave a note. How can this be happening? - How did she die? - She drowned. They're fishing her out right now. What does she look like? Oh, never mind. I don't want to know. She was an excellent swimmer. How? - She was tied underwater. - Oh. Don't tell me. Somehow the wire was wrapped around her leg and then tied. I asked you not to tell me. I don't want to hear all the gory details. The worst part was her face. It had this horrible expression on it. Must be awful to know you're gonna die. Gasping for air. Oh, you should've seen her face. She must've struggled to get away cos... cos there was a pool of blood all around her from that wire cutting into her leg. You enjoyed that, didn't you? You know how I hate it. That's why you do it, isn't it? You love it. Just like when you tell those hideous war stories. - Where are you going? - You be with Chris. Sooty... [GUN CLICKS] Bang! You're dead. My father's right. You're sick. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Chrissy. Oh, honey, I'm sorry I'm late. The traffic was a zoo. You OK? I don't know where that custom comes from where everybody just sits around and tries to be cordial. I mean, Sarah Thomas and her sucky cake that the maid baked. I mean, between the police and the sitters trying to comfort me, I couldn't even breathe. Keegan, I... I need you to help me. Listen, when Tom called last night, he was real unclear about what... Oh, Keegan, I just needed somebody to talk to. Keegan, it's impossible. I mean, who's next? There has got to be a reason. This is a sick game, I mean... I mean, the police are lost, and... You know, last night... I thought I might know something because, well, Linda and Randy were dating the same man. Keegan! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm listening. It's just that... Well, you're really scaring me here. I mean, you're saying that there is somebody out there killing people. I guess I just didn't want to face it. I mean, you know, one of those things you know but you just can't deal with. I mean, I've spent a lot of time trying to convince myself that Linda just died. - I can barely deal with that. - Look, I know. OK. So, we look for reasons. I mean, even the craziest person has got to have a reason. [SIGHS] [GASPING FOR AIR] ['PHONE RINGING'] Well, shoot. Uh-huh. What's a five-letter word for a four-letter word? Describes a vital part of the female anatomy. No, don't tell me. No, no, I can get this one. I know the answer. I don't know the answer. Alright. Alright, you can give me a clue. But only to the four-letter word. Uh-huh. Wait, what's that? [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] "Cunt"? [LAUGHS] Oh! That word! Mary Adams, you are filthy! Filthy! What? The five-letter word. Um... You know, this one is easy for me. Sooty. Yeah, she always was one. Huh? Uh... Well, I don't know. Well, maybe I will come over. Yeah. Huh? Yeah. Yeah, I liked her, too. Listen, M... I gotta go. Because I've got to take a shower. Huh? Well... Wait a second, I don't get it. Oh, come on, that's silly. No! No, it is not spooky being in this house alone. The shower? Yes, I saw the picture. No, no, no, I don't think Norman Bates was here. What? M, will you stop this? Because it is spooking me! What? No, I'm fine. I like this house, and I have got to take a shower, otherwise there will be no more dates for Keegan, get it? Right. Yes. Yes, I'll be careful. Fine. No. No, I don't look like Janet Leigh. M, I'm hanging up now. I'm hanging up. Goodbye! Mary Adams, I could strangle you! [♪ WHISTLING] - [ROGER] That's very attractive. - [SCREAMS] Oh! Oh, it's you. I frightened you. I'm sorry. No, no, I'm fine. Really. [EXHALES SHARPLY] Now, this is really silly of me. How did you get in? Ah, yes, I should have known. I can't think of anything to say, and I look like an old rag. Uh! Oh... [ROGER] I really shouldn't have dropped in like this. I just wanted to make sure you're getting along alright. Uh, don't go, please. I thought you needed someone to talk to. I mean, this can't have been your favorite time. I do. And it wasn't. I think he's got it in for me. Who? I mean, a man shows up, you get no clothes, no make-up, and wet, stringy hair. Now you have eleven seconds to look attractive. Go! [SIGHS] I didn't make it. I kind of like it. - Oh, sure! - It's true. I mean, look at me. I look like an old rag mop. Now, who would want to take out a rag mop with wet, stringy hair and an old towel on her head? Are you asking me out? No. I don't know. Well, it's not that I wouldn't go out with you, it's just a little unusual. Uh... Rag mops with towels on their head don't normally go out until at least March or April. [LAUGHING] You're shaking. Are you still frightened? - Great fire, huh? - Mm-hmm. You know, I really miss a good fire in the city... where I live... and where I work. "Oh, really, Keegan, where do you work?" Well, you know something, I'm glad you asked, because I'm a writer. And I work at a music magazine. Although I am thinking of moving to Minneapolis and working in the newsroom. What's it like being a cop? Do you know that Mary Adams told me you were in Vietnam with Billy Owens? What's it like being married to Sooty? God, it must be awful. The war! The war must be awful, not being married to Sooty. Oh, God, do you always kiss strange people? No, you're the strangest. Oh, I knew it. I'm talking too much, aren't I? I do! I talk too much sometimes. Oh! - Great fire, huh? - Mm-hmm. Well, you were my first cop kiss. Married cop kiss. Sooty and I don't see very much of each other. She has someone that looks good at parties, and I have enough money. Does that satisfy you? Who asked? You knew Linda pretty well, didn't you? I just can't believe all of this has happened. I mean, I expect her to walk through that door any second. It's just... I can't get used to the nothingness, you know? I mean, never seeing her again. Never. I wasn't finished. Doesn't seem real to me. I guess the war was like that. Hell. I liked the war. Oh... Oh! Private screening. You, me and Billy. That! I need that light for my bedroom. I know you like it here, but it's a little scary. Come on, chicken. [IMITATING LUCILLE BALL] Excuse us. I most certainly hope we can sit together, Harry. I told ya, we should've left earlier. Now sit. Harry! Tell the man to remove his hat. [IMITATING UNCLE HARRY] Lucille, you always do this, don't ya? [LAUGHS] Adorable and funny? Too much to hope for. What? What? What? I paid three dollars. I wanna see the picture. Happy now? [LAUGHS] Yeah. [KEEGAN] I hope you don't mind nails thrust into your arm. [ROGER] You sure do scare easily, don't you? - 'Is he dead, Doctor?' - 'No, he's still breathing.' [MOVIE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] Want a beer? A beer? Sure. [MAN 1] 'Everything is the way I left it.' [MAN 2] 'Well, that's a relief.' Oh! Billy! What are you doing back there? Come on, up here and sit next to me. OK. - 'The same hand that murdered Mrs. Krug.' - 'But I think we've got a chance this time.' Scary movie. You have an overactive imagination. - Do you want a beer, Lane? - Yeah. 'I forced him to do it.' [KEEGAN] Oh, wait, wait! I almost forgot. - Ta-da! [LAUGHS] - Oh! Have some. You know something? I think I love this girl. [WOMAN IN MOVIE SCREAMS] How about another beer? Good idea. OK. Boy, this broad's gonna drink us under the table. What's wrong with that? I happen to like beer. Just get it open. Yes! Would you people be quiet? Some of us are trying to watch the film. Boy, some people! Know what I mean? [WOMAN IN MOVIE SCREAMS] [MAN] 'Hans! 'Ruth!' 'Hans! 'What is it? 'Hans! 'Hans!' [MAN] 'Don't... look up! 'Oh, my God...!' That really wasn't a very scary movie. No. Piece of cake. Think my arm will ever heal? [CHUCKLES] Oh, I'm sorry! - Listen, I'll kiss it better. - I'll tell you what. Kiss me here, and I'll pass it on. Uh... Could we continue this in a minute? What's the matter? - Ladies' room. - Oh, ladies' room. Um... It's right over there. I'll tell you what, I'll meet you downstairs. You go down the stairs back there, up the aisle on the stage, make a left, and then go down the stairs. Billy will be down as soon as he closes up. - Alright? - Gotcha. [♪ WHISTLING] [SIGHS] Come on, Keegan. This is your overactive imagination working again. It's just quiet. That does not mean that there's something wrong. So what if it's two o'clock in the morning and you've just seen a monster film? And you're all alone... in a dark movie theater. [CLATTERING, WHIRRING] Oh, my God! Billy, is that you? Roger? Just turn to your left and go down the stairs. Terrific. Light probably blew out. What am I - out of my mind? Creeping around this spook house. Somebody turned that light out. Oh, my God! Roger? - Roger? - What? [EXCLAIMS] - Don't sneak up on me like that, goddammit! - I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. - It's not funny. - No, I'm... Come here. Come on now. Come on, come on. I'm sorry, really. - Come on. - Is she OK? Yeah, she's alright, she's just a little scared, that's all. - Billy. - It's OK. You didn't have any lights on. Billy never has any lights on. he knows every inch of this place. Come on, now.

Anyone down here? [CHOKING] Oh, my God. What are you doing, Mac? Go for help, Mel. Get the police. [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING CONTINUES] Hey, lady, where do you want these? You are crazy! You should've seen old Pop Willard's face when I dragged him out of bed to get me these. I told him it was a police emergency and that he had to get up. - This is for you, madame. - Oh, thanks. - And this is for you. - [LAUGHS] Oh, nice! And this is for you. I got some here for you. Some more here, and some out of my pocket here for you. [LAUGHING] Where is my crown? [LAUGHING] I, uh... I'm sorry I didn't call tonight. I got hung up at work. Oh, you see, I just keep waiting for this to fall apart. I'm scared. I don't know what I'm doing - you're married, and... You see, the world just is not the same. Today, the heroine has to save herself. God, I missed you. I'm not very good at this sort of thing. I don't know what you want me to say. Say... "I think I love you." I think I love you. You always know what to say. Oh, damn you, Roger Lane. I think it's a big deal now. [♪ DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, stranger. Buy me a drink? Sure. What will you have? Well, then, I'll have a glass of red wine and your next free evening. What are you up to? Well, you like to catch passes - I thought I'd throw one. You're gonna burn yourself. You, uh... working tonight? I guess. It's too bad. I thought maybe we could play house, or, uh... how about if I pretend I'm a hooker and you arrest me, only, uh... we do a little negotiation instead of going to jail. [♪ BALLAD PLAYING] Well, there is cute little Art Miller. Hi, Art. Wonder who his date is tonight. Wanna go to my apartment? Your apartment? It's just a little too noisy here to talk. Well, hon, you don't have to ask twice. So, how come I haven't seen this place before? How about some music, huh? You can always tell a lot about a guy by the kind of records he has around. I don't have any records. [♪ DISCO MUSIC PLAYING] Oh! Just me, it's just me. I tried to call you all day. Keegan, last night in the city he tried to kill me. - What? - In the parking lot. He was so strong. Two men came along, and he left. A black... - Hold on, Chrissy, Chrissy, Chrissy. - I'm sorry. Oh, don't be sorry. Now, what was black? He was all black. His gloves, his clothes. He wore a black mask, you know a ski cap with the eyes cut. I can't get over his eyes. I'll never forget them. They were... They were... They were really cold and... They seemed familiar. Does that sound crazy? No. No. Oh, God! I wish this nightmare would be over. I would love to just wake up without this nut. - [SIGHS] God, are you OK? - Yeah. - It's a stupid question. - No, no, no, I feel better. I gotta go. Tom's waiting for me in the car. Alright, now, listen. I'm gonna be home in a little while, and I'm just gonna stay there for a while and see if someone shows up. I was looking for... - Will you call me if you need me? - Mm-hmm. - You promise? - Yes. OK. You take care. I know. It's gonna be OK. - Bye, hon. - Bye, honey. Well... it's alright. These kind of things happen, you know? I'm not going anywhere. [CHOKING] [PHONE RINGING] There's still no answer. I guess she's not home yet. Look, I'm just gonna go over there. I'm sure she'll be back by the time I get there. Are you sure? - You want me to stay with you? - No, no. Roger needs you. You go ahead, I'll be alright. You sure? [♪ MUSIC PLAYING ON CAR RADIO] [HEAVY BREATHING] [CAR RADIO, INDISTINCT] [RADIO] 'And I want to tell you, we try to play the tunes at night 'that are the kinds of tunes that you and I both like a lot and keep us truckin', 'when the night is still young! So you stay...' [SCREAMING] [YELPING] [YELPING, PANTING] Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh...! Chris! [HEAVY BREATHING] [SCREAMS] [HEAVY BREATHING] No. No, please, no. No. No! No! No! No! [SCREAMS] No! [SCREAMING CONTINUES] There's nothing in this town. This isn't my life. Sooty and parties. I'm a good cop. But nothing ever happens here. So, I just thought I'd have a little fun with Linda. She fell through that window. I just wanted to scare her. Teach her a lesson. But I liked it. And each time it just got better and better. It was like our game, only it was real. And I use that board to give it a sense of order. It's an incredible feeling, you know? You hold someone's life in your hands, and because you choose... the life passes out of them. Now there's a game again. With winners and losers. And I'll score the touchdown. [HEAVY BREATHING] [ROARING] [SCREAMS] Billy. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. It can't be you. It can't be you. It can't be you. [PANTING] [SCREAMS] Ow! Oh! Damn! Oh! Oh! Oh...! [SCREAMS] Billy! [BILLY] 'You killed him, Keegan. He was my life. 'Goodbye, Keegan.' [♪ MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING STOPS]
