7,000 km from France: Zaire. Former Belgian Congo. Flanked to the west, by Angola and south, Zambia. Independent since 1960, Zaïre is 5 times the size of France. Capital :Kinshasa. 1500 km to the south, in the "copper belt", one of the biggest mines: Kolwezi. Don't worry, you'll do it! Oh, Delbart! - Do you want some r&r for your last day? - Now is the time! No more no less ! Do not cheat! He is not a former stationmaster! He's an ex-soldier! Climb up! You know ? I did not do my service! Anyway, the army, I didn't like it so much! - Hello... - Hello ! Have you ever driven one? Yes, in management training in Lubumbashi, but not so big. The layout is the same, except that this one takes 10 tons each time then inevitably, when you tip, it's a little shaky. When did you arrive? In Kolwezi, today. In Lubumbashi, a month ago. Good, come on! Where are you from ? - Sarreguemines. - Is there more work in Lorraine? Well, I was an industrial designer there, then ... unemployed for a year Yes that, of course, it's a good reason to come here! Besides, I'm single, so they put me in the hotel! - Good luck, good luck! - Hello ! Oh, I forgot! For greasing, check it yourself, because ... here is a bit of poetry ... it's Africa, eh! I almost forgot, come to Debruyn's, tonight. We'll celebrate my leaving - That way, we will also celebrate your arrival. - All right, all right. Good evening. My name is Damrémont, Philippe Damrémont. I was invited by Mr. Delbart. Is... could you announce my arrival, please? - I will tell Madame. - Thank you. Would you like one? Yes, I would, thank you. - Hi! - Hi! It's a really bad signal tonight! - As long as it's not like that tomorrow! - Because of the cup final? - Who's your favourite? - I'm from Lorraine, so ... I see ! Me, I'm betting on Nice. But with Platini, Nancy have a chance! I hope so! Good evening, I'm Annie Debruyn. But do not stand there, come on. We were waiting for you. Eh? Don't stand out here all night, huh? I'm coming, Mum - You know everyone? - No, I do not think so, madam. I will introduce them. - Mr. Damrémont. - Nice to meet you! - Sir, delighted. - Are you replacing Delbart? - Yes I am. - Well done! Come. It's very hot, huh? There are a few for the air conditioning. Don't you want to take off your jacket? Thank you, ma'am, I'm fine. I will introduce you to my husband. Darling ? - So, you are from Lorraine? - Yes that's me. - This is Dr. Bia Kombo. - Ah! Lorraine, Lorraine ... but what is Lorraine ? I hope you have your liberation front? And then, do not tell me that you are French, it's old fashioned! You're in luck arriving this year. Because last year at the same time, we had the Katangans at our backs. We were scared! But that's not too bad, despite everything. But since then, in Zaire all weapons are confiscated. We can't even go hunting. Our house engineer, Mike Hogey and his wife Lindel. - Hogey? - A foolish American! Oh! That coming from a Belgian! - Hi! - Good evening! - What did you think? - What, the mine? It's good. I don't care about mines I'm asking about my dancing! It's very good too. You don't know anything about it! He dances terribly! You want some champagne or red wine? No, I would prefer a beer. What do you know about the country? Well ... not much. Well, it's not complicated. Here is Katanga. Actually, they call it Shaba now, but .. it does not change the problem. The Zairians, those of the North, have always hated people here, the Katangese, because they're not the same ethnicity. So, the Katangese rebelled and most fighters are hiding in Angola or Zambia sometimes the Russians want to give them a hand. We are happy to do our job. By the way What do you think of Armande? Armande? Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, Armande, it's my digger! - Is that so? - Yours, now! I bet he can even break feet with his "Armande"! - Yes! - Elodie, my wife. You should dance instead! Just go! She is "first"! - Listen, I'm not very good at it. - What? Dancing. Who is that? - The company's doctor. - No, the girl Ah! Angelica? It's my sister! Come, I'll introduce you. Angelica? Mr. Damrémont. - Good evening, delighted. - Nice to meet you. I'm sorry, I was a little bit ... silly, just now. No probs! I did some manual work to pay for my studies, you know? By the way, it's good, now: "Honour to manual work"! Angelica? Excuse me. Did you find someone to take you back? - You want me to accompany you? - Yes. So, before Saint-Michel, the metro stops dead! I fall on a little lady! When the granny sees I am black, she starts to push & cries: "Wild species! Wild species! "this is how you drive with women?" I bare my teeth and answer: "With us, little women like you, we eat them, madame! " Bia likes to play negroes! It's his way of unwinding. Where do you live ? Right here. It's the Black Paradise. But I have my school, my students and I live there. All this is quite natural, you know ? - Who is that ? - These are the FAZs. Zairian soldiers - What does he want? - Give them some money. They don't get paid much. Thanks boss! You want me to take you home? You could get lost while leaving. Well ... goodbye, so ... my name is Philippe. Thank you, Philippe. Me, I'm Angelica. Yeah, yeah, I know... - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yes, we hear them from here! Oh, it must be some Zairian who makes the java! You surprise me If it was the FAZ, they would make a funny fiesta! Don't leave, I'll see. No doubt, my little father! It's the Katangese! The Tigers, yes - everywhere! Well, well, I'll try to do my job. I'm not sure if the guys at the mine know what's happening in town Don't worry, I'll be careful. Can you take the car, please ? It is better that you know where this he. Think about Delbart. He's probably pulling face! Shit - idiocy! The cows! They have already cut the phones! Look at the airport. They couldn't wait 24 hours before making a mess. Don't get upset, Pierre! You were not so sure about that today with a "maybe". With a "maybe", we had a chance, now it's "not at all"! Ah, we look proper smart! With all this mess on our hands and there's nothing to eat! - What shit! - Go ahead, say it! You're itching to! Yeah, what? We are in deep shit! What's this? It's a car from the Military Mission. Is that the head of the Mission? Colonel Grasse? What are you doing here ? My respects, Ambassador. Hello, Chamfort. So you forgot we had to be going, Chamfort and me, with the President? It was cancelled at the last minute in an incomprehensible way. I know for 30 minutes that he had the chance. - That's why I was waiting for you. - What is going on? This morning, at dawn, planes were destroyed on the Kolwezi airfield. And rebel troops attacked the garrisons of the city. Where did you get this information? From the Zairian air force. Its Kolwezi detachment was able to reach Kinshasa by radio. Did you get any more from the staff of the Zairian forces? No, I can't reach them General Namla! Try again later in the day. Your opinion, sir? Difficult to evaluate the rebel forces. But if they could attack the airfield and at the same time, enter the city, Because they are strong and well armed. And, in this case, do not expect a long organized resistance - Zairian forces. - I will make contact with my Belgian and American counterparts before calling Paris. What do you want? - We are Belgian citizens. - The boss! He is not there. Don't hide mercenaries and traitors. And no weapons ... otherwise ... There are no weapons here! Want to see our papers? Well... We walked a lot ... 3 days. We are hungry... We are not thieves, we are liberators. That wasn't so bad. It could have been worse, if they had found that. Why is this? We had to leave ... take the plane today. - What's in there? - Rifles and grenades! But what do expect? Our things! Laundry, dishes! Don't get angry, little sister. And above all, do not hide soldiers, No mercenaries, huh? Understood? Damien! - Stop it, that's my kid! But you're crazy, ain't you? Hold on! So? There were no soldiers, huh? Well ... I couldn't know that he was there! You clearly see? The garden has no fence. - You smashed my car, huh? - Fellow? You did not hide soldiers? You do not, huh? That's good ... get going. Go! We'll take the corpse. God, Elodie! What is this kid doing in the garden with these guys? You don't want me to tie him down? - Where are you going, now? - Oh shit ! But give me that! No, it's not true, this kid! Come on, come on! You're crazy, Pierre! The door is still open! What do you want to do with it? It can still be used... The magazine is full. They can also come back for it! - Where are you from? - A friend accompanied me. Come and help me! - What is this? - The electricity has been cut! Shit! It's heavy like a dead donkey, that thing! What's in there? Rice I know, sir! Rice is not food for Europeans But you'll be glad to have it when we have nothing else. - We can go, yes? - Yes. Go down into the foyer. Everyone evacuate the hotel! Leave your things! Do not take anything. Quickly, get out! Go down into the foyer. What do they want, these sluts? I didn't even finish eating! Gather round! Despite some pockets of resistance, we can consider this morning, Sunday, that Kolwezi fell, Ambassador. Part of the Zairian forces were pushed back to the north. They do not seem able to reorganize and take back control of the city. It is always difficult to evaluate the strength of rebel forces but their supervision seems competent and efficient. I'm afraid that was right, gentlemen. The operation is big. Ambassador, I don't think we should let the rebels enter Kolwezi. Otherwise, the 3,000 Europeans in the city will quickly become hostages. I know. We must wait for Paris' decision. - Hello, gentlemen. - Still nothing from Kolwezi? No nothing, Ambassador. Nancy, thanks to a goal from Platini, beat Nice in the cup final and the weather is becoming very favourable. I fear that French opinion is hardly prepared for an intervention of our troops. Even if it is about saving civilians I'll be back at noon and I will call the Elysee. They don't seem to have come for fun. There's no reason for them to bother us. We're not a part of their plan - Do you know that I love you? - I know. And yet, you're not my type, eh? You look like a little soldier, like that! All experiences are interesting. You remember what we did in New York, during the power cut because there was no telly? What, in broad daylight? I'll be right back Mercenaries! Fire! Lindel! Lindel! - My respects, General. - Hello, Colonel. This attack doesn't surprise us. For weeks, we knew the details of the "Operation Dove". - "Dove"? - Tshikapa in kipendé. Our president was warned, 48 hours ago, by the Soviet Ambassador so we were aware of this invasion plan. But we were not expecting its execution until June. - Where are your troops now? - Don't worry, Colonel. We are in control of the situation in Shaba, but more precisely: Kolwezi. Our forces are everywhere and all European nationals are under their protection. Car! I don't have a car. My husband has it. You! Come & fix the car. OK, but I warn you, I don't know much about it Quickly! What does Mrs Debruyn want? Their car is broken down. Is that so? Damn it. A cable is broken. You! Your car! It's not working, it's broken down. Check for yourself! - Give me the part you removed. - What part ? I tell you it is broken down. Put it back. It's OK Do what he asks you! I said: quickly! Were my 3 messages sent yesterday received? They were. And I can tell you that the President personally looked into the case. Please specify to the President that it is a major military operation whose goal is to seize Shaba Province. In Kolwezi, despite some pockets of resistance, the city is occupied by thousands of men in uniforms. Now the 3,000 Europeans who reside there can be considered as hostages in the hands of the rebels. What are your suggestions? I'll pass you over to Colonel Grasse. It is possible to restore the situation by an airborne operation. Three paratroop companies in the fastest time would do the trick. Pierre Delbart? It's you? - Yes. - Follow us! - Where? - To the court. - What's this all about? - Don't worry about that, little sister! - Follow us immediately. - No, Pierre, don't go! Listen, I can't do otherwise. Don't worry, it's probably bullshit. - So, I'm going with you. - You don't move from here and you take care of the nipper. Understood ? Don't worry, go! I will be back for dinner. They arm their supporters. These guys are civilians from Kolwezi. There's news. I wanted to inform you before going home. I'm coming back to the Foreign Affairs department right now The Zairian government is appealing for international aid. - What kind of help? - Help of any kind. Finally! It's Chamfort. I asked him to go probe the Belgians and join us here. Without this Zairian request, nothing was possible What would be decisive is that the Belgians agree to participate in an operation. They are formally opposed to any intervention, for now. They plan to negotiate the evacuation of the Europeans with the International Red Cross. But it will not work! And that just gives the rebels more time. Take him away! I didn't do anything! Get off! I am innocent! Leave me! - Do you work at the mine? - Yes. Contact the "Economy" collaboration. Silence ! - I protest! - Shut it! - Are you Delbart? - Yes. You are accused of complicity with the group "The Wealth of the People". What does that mean? You're crazy! You know very well that it's wrong! I work as a driver at the mine. - I am a worker, nothing else. - Shut up! You are an exploiter! And for this reason, the court sentences you to death. Your court is a circus! It's an assassination! Why let this happen? If you had power in this country, you too would need these types - like me - That's enough! The sentence is enforceable at once! Take him away! Commanding officer. You know the comrade next to the officer there? Seiko. He worked at the mine. It's me who employed him. You coming? Do you think I'm scared? Fire! Get going! You can go home. Poor old man. What are you going to do with it? They almost got me once, they won't get me again. If I have to die, I will take a few other skins first. Why look at me like that? You take me for an exploiter or a racist too? Who's talking to you about this? OK. I lived in Africa for 15 years. And it wasn' just for my job. I liked it. And Africans, I loved them. These days, I'm fed up with their... savagery. Yeah, I know, I say bullshit. But it's true that I was scared. Like never in my life. Belgians from Kolwezi ask Brussels for an airborne operation. I sent a message to the Élysée. I can only confirm that an airborne operation on Kolwezi, completed as soon as possible, can unlock the situation and save what can still be salvaged. I also suggest that a Franco-Belgian operation with Zairian support is what we think is desirable. For my part, I already advised General Namla to airlift the battalion Major Maélé's Zairian paratroopers in Lubumbashi and engage them by road to Kolwezi. Listen to me, Annie! This corner has become dangerous with these armed civilians. We'll take refuge at Van Zeel's. Come with us ! I ask you once again. And what if Marcel came back? - Even if he wanted to, - I don't think he can. - Your son is right. The Zairian PC is right ahead and he still resists. I hope the helicopters arrive, they promised to evacuate the Europeans. I took what was needed, mum. I think it's better to go there. I think that there is someone, by God! I am French, open up! I don't know where to go, I just arrived Do not insist, we will not open up to anyone. Open up, I tell you I don't know where else to go! Bugger off! It's not a big deal, madam. Just heat stroke, that's all. - Hi, old man. - Hi. How long will we stay? - You promised to evacuate us. - Calm down. - Where are the helicopters? - Calm! As long as our PC, opposite holds, you are not at risk. You are safe under our protection. Be patient, trust me. We will not abandon you. Where are you going, doctor? Listen. I was called here to look after a child. Now I'm going back to the hospital. Stay here, instead. These people may need you. You do not believe in this evacuation, huh? The helicopters ain't coming, we know it, but we shouldn't take away that hope. Fair enough ... I'll stay. Do you think we might be saved? You, the Europeans, maybe ... After all, your soldiers are only 8000 km from here. While I am in my own country. Soldiers on the other side of the street are ours and I am Katangese like the rebels. So, I wonder who will save me. Let's count on providence, Annie ... and think about ourselves. We are witnessing a fire and we ask "who holds the Extinguisher?" I hear you General, keep me informed. But if we do not do anything, we will be charged with non-assistance to those in peril. Yes, General, in danger of death! My respects, General. The 2nd company of the 311th Zairian has jumped near Kolwezi. Stupid! Unsupervised they will run into disaster! It's done, they have not even achieved their objective! They were dropped everywhere except on the aerodrome. They are scattered in the countryside Kolwezi is 20 km away. And Major Maélé? For now, he is following the plan that you advised. He left Lubumbashi with his battalion and headed for the bridge of Lualaba. I'll go and see. Hey! Here they are, look! They are surely coming for us! But we didn't see the helicopters arrive The helicopters have arrived, they have come to get us! Get back! Don't go out! They are Katangese! What are you going to do? Come on! The revolver, quickly! George, close the gate. Come on! They will kill you, too! Are you hurt? Are you hurt, Annie? I ... it's nothing ... I assure you, Georges. It's nothing. Try to turn over. I need to see. The bullet did not penetrate. It just scuffed you. But you might have a broken rib. Shit! I left my first aid kit downstairs, if only, I ... It's OK Don't worry about me. Maélé and his men could have seized Kolwezi airfield. - It could lead to change our plans - Certainly not ! The aerodrome is more than 5 km from the city. Deploying our paras will force us into a long and difficult advance that will leave the rebels time to retaliate against Europeans or to withdraw taking hostages. No, more than ever you must jump to the heart of the city. Where most of the Europeans are. We run the risk of dropping Paras on buildings, on trees, - on fences, on ... - But yes. But we will put them in bad shape! Do you believe that the hostages aren't in bad shape after a few days? - For you, Colonel. - I understand your scruples. There is only one tactical choice: grasp the nettle! Mr Ambassador ... Some para units in France have been alerted since 10am this morning Regain all your companies in speed, we are on the alert. So, be wise, huh? Capito? Frederico, this alert, you believe how serious is this time? It's possible. We're ready for that, you know. Yes of course. But I'll call you if we leave. And if it's just an exercise, I will be home tomorrow. - Okay. - Go ahead. Yes General. Here, I think I can gather all my items on time. But I have a section at the commando stage Montlouis that need to go back by plane. I heard, General. My regards. I have legionaries in exercise at the Vergio pass. But I would prefer you back by helicopter, it's safer! Well, well, I'm counting on you, thank you. By 2 am I will have recovered all my people, Colonel. All the better, the alert is confirmed. - And where is it for? - I do not know. But in the meantime, we keep the pressure on. Attention! Section ready, Captain. - Put them at ease. - At ease! Package divided into 2 parcels: Package B in the vehicle for the 2nd rotation of the planes. According to your orders, Captain. - Arms ? - Checked, Captain. Murin, Captain. Back from Castelnaudary. Ah! Time has passed to what I see in Murin. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Captain. I propose that Corporal Murin join to the group leaders, Captain. He is a good shot. - Leave it to the FRFA instead. - At your command, Captain. Attention! At ease! It's not a drill, this alert? The Colonel did not tell me anything, personally! Say, You fucked those cuties, over there? - And how, yeah! - Bloody tell me! That would make you dream, huh? It's okay, you haven't done it. Where can we go to, Chief Warrant Officer? The quiet corners are not hard to find: Chad, Mauritania... Lebanon, Zaire. I must forget about it! Zaire? It is too far. You see us doing 8,000 km by plane? Me? Not really. Flying makes me puke Then you're stupid, Why choose the paras, then? Well, to jump! Even if they are not far, they must be sleeping. We can't hear them, anyway. Don't go. I can wait. I need my first aid kit, Annie. It's got what you need for treatment. Bia! Georges! It's okay now, Annie. I got it! But ... I can't do anything now We'll have to wait for the day. It's nothing ... I can wait. You saw it, didn't you? How is that possible ? You must know, you. - Those are... - ... my brothers. Yes, Annie. Injustice creates unreason all over the world. But, in Africa ... revolt is always close by victory and massacre ... or then scarper when there is more hope of overcoming. Four hours. How 4 hours? It is 22:30 hours No, four hours to join Solenzara. Ah yes. Without these security problems, we were leaving Bastia ... Yes I'm listening No, Colonel, still nothing. Yes, we're waiting. Berthier, I'm listening. I'll pass you the Élysée, Ambassador, do not leave. - Mr. Ambassador? - I'm listening. I inform you that the President of the Republic just warned the head of the Zairian state that in accordance with his request, an airborne operation will be undertaken by the French in Kolwezi. Thank you. This is Grasse, I'm listening. This is the Army Operational Centre in Paris. I officially inform you that the principle of an airborne operation on Kolwezi is acquired. Send us by Telex the tactical scheme - and the date you are considering. - I'll send it tonight. You are now in command of this operation. I put at your disposal the 2nd Foreign Parachute Regiment. Loud and clear. The operation will be called Leopard. For the group... Attention! Regiment assembled in full. Ready to board. At your orders, Colonel! Unit commanders. Embark! 3rd Company at my command. By section, board! 2nd section, embark! You'll do better to stay with us. Thank you, but I want to try to find my friends, to know what has become of them. Thank you anyway. Thank you for everything. Goodbye. Goodbye. Good luck! Maybe something will happen There is no reason for us to be abandoned like this. Yes I hope so ! Goodbye, good luck! Stop! Your papers. I have just arrived in Kolwezi. I work as a labourer at the mine. Lies! - You are a French mercenary! - What are you talking about, I ... Quiet! You are a mercenary. You are all mercenaries! - Listen, I'm a worker. - Come on! Leave! I said, go! Come on, turn around ... and leave. - You were told to go back. - No way I will not go back. And why? Because you will never have the courage to shoot a man who looks you in the eyes. Come on, go home. Section, attention! One step left. Left! The last of each column will be chore. Turn around, right! From behind, clear the row. Not all planes have arrived yet. Take the opportunity to eat and put the weapons away. It's going to be a mess, this embarkation! If you want to eat now's the time Hey, ain't you eating? - Cut the crap - You're still going to puke And without anything in your belly, it's worse Shut it! Gentlemen. Your destination is Zaire. You will jump on Kolwezi. You have to liberate 3,000 Europeans of all nationalities currently taken hostage and threatened with being executed. The president of the Republic, in person, entrusts you with this mission. Georges! Keep me from screaming! You know me. It won't be long. That's it, it's over. In a few minutes, you'll feel better. Colonel? This is headquarters in Paris. Grasse here, I'm listening. We received your communication setting the date of the operation to Saturday. It's too late. It must take place tomorrow Friday at dawn. Tomorrow at dawn? - Out of the question! - Yes! At dawn! Listen: we are fighting for the operation to take place on Saturday in the most favourable conditions A 24h advance would only increase the risks we are already running. Plus, according to my information, the 2nd REP has not yet taken off from Solenzara. It'll be done in one moment. So, at best, the regiment will reach Kinshasa at night! How would you like in a few hours, I assure the transfer of men and their boarding in Zairian planes? And Kolwezi is 1,500 km from Kinshasa! - Four hours of flight - Good. - I share your reservations. - Don't miss it! That's Paris taking the bit between the teeth It's possible they have good reasons to want to speed up the operation but I would like to know what Zairian Forces Staff calling Colonel Grasse. Chamfort, I'm listening. I have important information for you. Our intelligence services have just captured and decrypted a message from Angola. As you see it is signed Mbumba, "Lieutenant-General of the rebels" and it is addressed to "Major Mufu, Chief Katangese troops in Kolwezi" - Are you sure of its authenticity? - Unfortunately, yes. Can I rely on your planes at 5:30, tomorrow morning? - Naturally. - General. Chamfort to Gulf Romeo. I'm leaving Namla's house. There is news. Try to contact urgently Colonel Deval of the airforce to provide us Mirages in support tomorrow. Tell the Ambassador that I will take it immediately. Done. - What's going on ? - The Katangese have been warned by European radios of an imminent raid on Kolwezi. They are preparing to evacuate and are sabotaging the mining facilities. I also heard the order to execute all their prisoners. Katangese don't bluff certainly not. Paris, obviously, is surely right. We will jump on Kolwezi tomorrow, Friday. It is impossible for Deval to provide us with air support for tomorrow. The 2 Mirages we need are ready but he has no more ammunition. He's hoping for Friday night. We will jump without air support. Inform Paris. We will approach the jump zone from the West. In column formation. We will drop at 200 meters. Dufrez from Golf Romeo. Colonel commanding the 2nd REP is he on board this aircraft? Ah. Very good. Tell Chamfort that he's coming to join us here with the elements already in place. What news from other aircraft? The arrival of the next plane is scheduled around 02:00 hours I do not have exact data for the others. Stay in the control tower and keep me informed. - Good to see you! - When do we jump? This morning, at noon. Takeoff scheduled at 08:00 hours Unfortunately your regiment will have to jump in two waves. Other sections will arrive too late, surely. I will take the rest of your regiment by DC-10 transport from Air Zaire to an airfield near Kolwezi. - We will save time. - Perfect. There is one disadvantage. The medical unit is located in the last plane. Worse, we'll jump without a medical unit. Will we have Mirage support? No, you will have to do without that too. All that doesn't matter. Since the chaplain is here, he will be able to say some prayers. Finally, we have parachutes You can collect them right now. 4! 5! 6! Chief Warrant Officer! What is it? Shit! American ones. Well, it's nothing. A parachute is a parachute. And the Americans are no more stupid than us. Look at how it is all loose. - Why didn't we take ours? - We were too busy And stop moaning! Chief Warrant Officer! There is no way to attach weapons We will be asked to hold them between our teeth, you'll see! Shut your mouths a bit, huh? Listen ! With wire and string, you are going to make a bodge and you tie your weapons, understood? Do it! They're on pot, these yanks! They jump by smoking the cigar! I will summarize. For the drop we have 5 Zairian planes plus a French Transall which will serve us as a command post. The planes will certainly have difficulty finding the drop zone. But I didn't have time to ask the rebels to mark it for us. I also remind you that Kolwezi is 1,500 metres above sea level. The jump itself will be difficult and perhaps imprecise. The planes will drop at 200 metres It will limit the risks for the men The first objectives must be reached quickly. Even if it leads to losses. We must force the rebels to about-face and save their skin before they have time to take care of the hostages. I also require a very strict discipline of fire to avoid the risk of causing losses within the civilian population. Gentlemen? It will soon be time. Get ready On your feet! Help your comrades there! Have a piss and get equipped. Go quickly ! You lot - go and piss! Go! Last one's a dick! Come on, eat your arse! Merlin! This is the office of the Military Attaché, I'm listening. - This is, General Gaveau, COA. - My respects, General. Do you know if the 2nd REP has already taken off? It's 08:00h, in principle, they should've taken off, but I have no information. If the manoeuvre hasn't started immediately delay it. Well understood, I will warn Colonel Grasse straight away provided that it's not too late. - Lefray? - Yes, Captain? Take over, I'm off to the airport. Yes sir. Colonel, a message for you! COA. The operation is postponed. Stop your engines! - The operation is postponed. - Whatcha mean postponed? I don't know any more for now. It might allow your medical unit to arrive. Best thing is for the men to disembark and assemble in the hangars. No, I prefer to wait here, near the planes. You never know. Roger. I'm off to the Embassy and will call Paris. You know where my wife and son are? No I don't know. I had trouble coming so far, you know? I hope they were not here When it happened. I escaped from the mine. Rebels are starting to panic and want to blow everything up Good God! Where did they go? At Delbart's, maybe? That's not possible, it's on the other side of the city! You are looters, stop! You are the looters! I am here at home! You, outside! Leave it to us! We will kill him! - We'll kill him. - Leave it to us! Gather round! Yes I... Come in ! Of course. I'll tell him about it. What is happening, Ambassador? Rest assured, I just spoke to the Élysée. The president thought the jump was in progress. He personally oversees the operation. - Did you get the confirmation Telex. - What does it mean ? I'll call the staff. There is surely a manoeuvre, somewhere. I learned that the Belgian paras will land in Kamina tonight. They were ordered to evacuate the Europeans from Kolwezi but without participating in any military activity. How can you evacuate a city without firing a shot? They're hoping the Katangese will let them? This is not supposed to interfere with the French troops. Madness! The joint operation was possible! Now, it's too late. Colonel Grasse, in Kinshasa! What is this mess? This is the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces. Take off immediately. What are they going to do? Shoot us! This is the Douala River. We should reach Kolwezi in 1 hour. Kolwezi. I'm clearing right. Wait, it sounds like a plane! No, they are planes! We just missed the jump zone. Like that, they are warned that we are arriving! - Looks like they're leaving. - What do you mean ? The planes leave? It's not possible! Have you seen what's going on outside? If the soldiers leave here, they will kill us. That's how it happens in all countries of the world. If we want to save our skin, we must stay here! Even if we have to fight! Planes... Planes! You heard? I tell you that they are planes! It's them, mum! It's almost over! We’re goint to be saved! In position. Go! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! Shit!

We must hold the door to keep it shut Push! Push! Understood. You report many civilian corpses. Section completed. We are under fire - You need help ? - No, that's fine! We will fight! Let’s not muck about here! - How many are they? - 3! Ioko! Shoot the grenade! Attack! Hey, look! I almost got my balls cooked up there! We have two armoured cars in front & the anti-tank team isn’t here, what now? Wait for Blue 3, they have the equipment. - Blue 3, I'm listening. - Where are you? All done! Let’s get to the gendarmerie. Warning, Blue 2 is blocked by 2 armored cars. - Join. - Let's go. Over & out. Sibourg! Get ready, you have an appointment with two armored cars! Two?

On the terrace, up there. - Well? - He's hiding. Smith! Try in the museum Watch out! Our security, Murin! Get busy! This guy made us lose enough time. Let's go ! - So, what took you? - Oh nothing! Don’t worry about it Warning ! Come, come quickly! Look out! God's name, he's gone. They left. - It's ended there, they're gone. - Is that true ? - That's right ... right? - Stay here ! Lie down! Sibourg! Ioko, get ready! Blue 2 to Blue 3. - Blue 2 receiving. - We are in position Sibourg, take your pick. We will take the other with the rifle grenade Attack! I had two wounded and you, were you injured? One killed. Marcos. Well, you come with us to the gendarmerie. Come on! Chief Warrant Officer! There are a lot of people in there, I can hear them talking Lieutenant -French army ! -Do not shoot! We are prisoners Put your hands up in the air. You can give up. Come on, come on. Go ahead. - Verdu! - Chief Warrant Officer? See if there are any wounded. Move it. Move it. - Do you have a bandage? - In my right pocket. Give it to him. Let's go children of the motherland The day of glory - has arrived. - Forward! Against us tyranny The bloody banner is lifted Blue to Blue 2! - Blue receiving. - This is Blue 2 and Blue 3. Target achieved. But who's singing? The prisoners we just delivered to the gendarmerie. We arrived on time, they would go there. Congratulations, but do not be distressed, huh? Blue 2 stays put to evacuate the survivors. Blue 3 continues on Bravo, next goal, Over & out. It's not the 14th of July madame Stay in your house! It’s dangerous outside. Bravo! - Vive la France! - Vive la France... vive la France, I want... but long live the French ... I am Italian ! - You cover Murin. - Well done. I get the impression we were not expected. Good God! Niokolo! Take some men with you and search the hotel. Blue, Blue 3. Goal achieved. No resistance. The guys closed the case but - they left a gift behind them. - Speak clearly, Blue 3. Clearly, that means a pile of corpses. All blacks. Don’t ask me how many. I don’t take the time to count. In any case, the hotel is empty ... Attention, Captain! Come over here, Captain. You can leave, there is no danger. Thank you. Sorry, ladies. Go through the garden, you can take them back. This way! So, you shoot well for a civilian. Well then! For once the Legion finds that the colo is not so bad! Here, take this, it will be more effective than your gun Thank you, “Old One”! Did you kill one, dad? No, I missed him. He missed, mum The inhabitants, especially the Europeans, are beginning to stir despite our advice to stay at home. Good then, watch out for mistakes, huh? And open fire only with certainty. Over & out. Bia! Why didn’t they come here? Paras are there, I'm sure. We heard them fighting! But yes, for sure, they are there. But they are not going to liberate the city in just a few hours. We must be on the wrong side, that's all. I can’t take it anymore! Think of your mother, Georges. For her, it's worse. Annie? I have two tablets left. Do you want them now? No. I can wait. - Bia? - Georges. Give me your hand. Try to sleep. You're not on duty so rest. Don’t worry, go. I understand what you felt. Shooting a man with a FR-F1, it's a bit like ... But you had to. You had to do it! I know all that. But I didn’t think it would be so difficult. Tell yourself it was for the opposite side too. However... he killed Marcos. We are here to do it. But war is stupid. I would rather not have the FR-F1, I can’t get used to it. Nobody asks you to get used to it only to do what you have to! There’s a car Beware of mistakes, do not shoot on sight - only with certainty! No, let it continue Go ahead ! Show yourself and give the order to stop. By God! Stop! French army ! Fire! Chief Warrant Officer! Blue 3 receiving. Blue 3, are your men firing? Affirmative. Four blokes in a car. We got them. Losses? We have a slight injury. Over & out. What's up, my friend, you have nothing broken. Yet, in the lights, they would have seen that you were like them. It's you who see wrong, Chief Warrant Officer. I am not black. I am a legionnaire. We'll evacuate you in the medical unit. - It’s nothing! - Obey, Legionnaire! Murin, do you care, huh? This is Colonel Grasse, I just landed on Kolwezi airfield still held by Maélé. The Belgians are disembarking & entering Kolwezi. But we are still fighting at different points of the city! I'm going to see Colonel Maez, the Belgian commander. The 2nd REP is deployed in Kolwezi. You can not interfere with their plan. I have formal orders. Here they are. "Establish at Kolwezi Airfield "a reception post for all Western nationals "in readiness for repatriation. "Do not participate in any way with the French military action. "Operation limited to 72 hours." - 72 hours? - I'm sorry. But these instructions are clear and I must respect them. It will create panic in the population! We don't want to leave a ruined town free for looters. Do we agree on our zones of activity to avoid interference? When you ride to the district of Manika ... but do not go in, the cleaning is in progress ... They are well hidden these bastards! It won’t be easy dislodging them. Who are those rangers heading that way? Shit, the Belgians! They’re going to enter the snipers’ target area. Cover me. I'm going to try to intercept them. 2nd section, Fire! French army! Shit, stop! French army I said! Stop, men! What are you doing here? This zone is not yet cleared. Yeah, I see that. Excuse us, but we did what we could for 2 days, huh? If you were planning on going in there easily, you arrived a little too early. Always caustic, Maurois! Good God, De Vrint! - What are you doing in this village? - I didn’t expect to see you here. - Looks like you did a good job. - We try. Wait, we're going to hide because that we risk taking one there. - Retreat on the right. - To the right ! So, it seems that you are charged to evacuate the Europeans? - Yes ... those who want. - Yes I know. For the moment, the entry of Belgians does not pose a problem. Only one column has been stopped by a sniper shot, - Blue taking care of it. - And Blue 3, any news? Good God ! - Chief Warrant Officer, do you hear? - Always talk, we'll see. There are at least a hundred men in uniform. They are on the road, they have three lorries. Sure they’re not Belgians? I’m not blind. Sir, they are black. They all seem ready to move. What do I do ? Nothing. Do not shoot. They could be Zairians. Get hidden. Wait for the guys from "Violet" I exhausted what I had. I do not have anything to cure you, Annie. I know. I can hold out. If he doesn’t arrive today, I will go out, do you hear? Stay calm. Calm down. This time it's them. It's them ! And it's for us! They’re heading straight for us, the fools! Your group, in the woods. The others, with me - Violet from Sun. - Violet receiving. - Did you join Blue 3? - Not yet. - We are 800 meters behind. - Good, get a wriggle on. Apparently, Blue 3 is falling hard. Plan "Camellia". Over. - Blue to Violet 3. - Violet receiving. Speak, Blue 3. 3 lorries with a hundred rebels heading towards us. We are in ambush position. We will stay in the edge. They will fall on us any minute now. We would rather not stay here long alone. Where are you ? On the same road, behind you. Give your details for mortar support. 785, 290. We will hang them as soon as they go out. They will surely break through. There are a lot for us. Afterwards, they’ll be for you. - Here they are, can we fire? - Affirmative! Fire! Chief Warrant Officer, Camellia. Retreat, mortar fire! Camellia. Further from 200 ... 350 ... Efficiency by 8. Ready for the assault! Attack! Bleu 3 to Violet, speak. Sergeant ! The Chief Warrant Officer is touched! Speak, Blue 3... Speak, Blue 3. Sir! - Report! - Shit, he's dead. Speak, Blue 3. Speak, Blue 3! This isBlue 3. 1 lorrydestroyed, 15 rebels killed, hWe have suffered one loss: Chief Warrant Officer Frederico. Inspect this building and watch out for the snipers. Lieutenant, It's horrible in there! The Legion marches to the front By singing we follow Heirs of his traditions We are with her We are the men assault troops Soldiers of the old Legion Those who want to be evacuated, hurry up! At least give my wife time to take a suitcase, right? We have orders not to evacuate non-Europeans. What? That’s not OK, she’s my wife I won’t leave without her. And my son. Did you see my son? Maybe I should leave him here, according to your orders? It's good, get all three. And you ? Rest assured, you will not have to worry about me, it's my country and I'm staying! If I can, I'll say goodbye at the airfield. Take care of the house, huh? Because today, it's Berezina. Kolwezi and surroundings are in our hands. Good. It’s certain our operation has saved many human lives but this evacuation will do of Kolwezi a dead city. In a way, the rebels also won. Delbart, are you leaving? You know me, anyway, it was planned, huh? And the others ? Others ? Others, they can’t do otherwise. Come on ... Take care, Sambene. Congratulations Legion! Damremont! I am happy to see you again. Living. Yeah, we did it. Roger and his wife were killed. And you:how did it go? Debruyn is dead. - Oh shit. - And Annie and George? It's okay, they're alive. They are at the airport. I met Bia, he went to warn Annie. And Angelica? It's ok ... you'll see... at the airport. Poor Annie. -Pierre ! - That's it, my good man! Let him go, can’t you see that you’re scaring him? Have you no shame ? Forgive them, Bia. As long as it's them who forgive, one day. For Marcel. I promise you to do the necessary. Thank you. Georges ? Try to watch over her. At home, in Belgium, you will recover very quickly. Home is here. Almost. I promise I will try to forget everything. But I don’t want to forget you. I will try to find you Pierre and Élodie. Let's go. Pierre ! You had forgotten. - Ah! - You kept it, though. It's not just that - I wanted it here. Have you seen ? Come see us in Aveyron, Doc. Your bullshit will be missed! Me, it's your big mouth I’ll miss - Are you hurt? - It's ok, it's nothing serious ... All aboard! We didn’t have much time to get to know each other, huh? You know, Angelique, I'll come back. Really ? You want to come back? I would be surprised to find work in France again. - So, I think I ... - I understand. Even if I find work, I will come back, Angelique! I'll come back, you understand? Translated by MrPatchyQuilt Hero of the Soviet Union
