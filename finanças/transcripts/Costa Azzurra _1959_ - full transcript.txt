COSTA AZZURA AKA WILDCATS ON THE BEACH "Each year the great international world crowds the beaches of the French Riviera." Your husband is reading, and where is your head? I am here with my head and with everything else! - Where are you going? - To freshen up, if I may. Always around the corridor! Canât you wait for us to arrive? Button up! Keep your eyes lowered! - Nicola! - What? I am Adelina, your sister Luciaâs school mate. Adelina! How are you? Whatâre you doing here? - And you? - For business. So you recovered! Yes. Did you also hear that... Your uncle was worried! He told everyone about it, poor thing! Poor? Heâs richer than the Cinquemanis! - By the way... - Adelina! - Is the gentleman bothering you? - Oh, no! Itâs Nicola Ferrari, the brother of one of my schoolmates. The brother of your schoolmate is on our train? Yes. What a coincidence! He is my husband. - You got married? - Yes. You talked for an hour and didnât say you were Mrs. Cinquemani? - Cinquemani! - Anyway... Pleased to meet you. The pleasure is mine! My gosh! Are you transfixed? It must really be true that there are seven women for every man! Two are enough for me. Well... Letâs make it three! With so much stuff, I wouldnât know which to choose! I donât choose. I take what I find. You are free, but I am stuck with that old imbecile! You call him imbecile? He is a billionaire. Carsoli had a billion before the war. Imagine today! I can only count to 120,000, my salary from the paper. Iâd like to be in your place. Writing about Carsoli means getting close to him, being his friend. And so? Heâll offer me an aperitif as I did yesterday with you. - But it's your turn today. - No! Okay, Iâll pay. As always! Itâs strange to see a dressed woman here. Itâs exciting! Think of her nude underneath! She looks like sheâs waiting for a kiss. - Go kiss her. - What if I really did? What could she say? A curse word? Sheâs foreign, I donât understand! Letâs go eat! - Want to bet? - Yes, yesterdayâs aperitif. Iâll say the curse word in Italian! Say it anyway. Ouch! Not that! - Wasnât it foreseen? - No! Letâs go get the aperitif. Why are you laughing? She made a fool of you! You canât even pick up a woman! It was easy with her! Look at how she walks! - She is an honest girl. - And has lots of money! Welcome aboard. Youâre Mr. Santoni, right? - Yes, I am. - Mr. Carsoli was waiting for you. - He asked for you three times! - Heâs a bit impatient. Please, sit down. Iâll tell him youâre here. Thank you. You want another slap? - No, I hate repetitions. - Youâre the official biographer! And you are the daughter of a famous man. - Youâre not his daughter? Better! - Can you keep a secret? Weâve already come to secrets? Try to forget that we ever met. Dear friend! Have you been waiting long? - I just arrived. - You've been waiting a few minutes. But when one talks to a girl like her, time flies. Your secretary was telling me that... Did she say she was my secretary? I would be stupid if such a lovely girl were my secretary! Havenât we already met? You journalists all have the same face. - So do you billionaires! - Please sit down. Letâs get to us... Someone established that it is fit that people know me as a benefactor with a tender heart. Trash magazine idiocies! I wonât take too long. With just a few elements, I will write the story. Youâll like it. Me? I donât care at all! You will observe me, Iâll tell you some fibs and you will write a novel full of imagination. No! I'll come on land right away. Come here tomorrow. My secretary will give you the time. Alright, sir. See you tomorrow. - Doesnât he live at Villa Brech? - We canât, for the time being. His grandchildren arrived, and he divided the two branches. One is the heirs, the other is the two of us. We must avoid contagion! Well... Goodbye. I wasnât to say I had seen you because... Because I preferred it that way! Do you mind? I am happy to share a secret with you. Good-day. And now here is Rita Elmont, the American star, the "royal tiger". She is welcomed by a smashing applause that comes, above all, from male hands. In fact, we donât think the women are enthusiastic about this very dangerous companion, who is so indifferent to common morals. Her four divorces, her four marriages with men who were already married, made the women of America indignant. They call her "husband thief". But it doesnât seem to worry Rita. - How was the movie? - Rita! Next will be better! - Good evening to director Maestri! - Good evening, my friend! What are your projects? I'll do a film thatâs an old dream. One performed only by men. - Who will be the actors? - All new performers. I look for them on the outskirts, in the street, on the beaches. I want to create them my way. - Will there be a woman too? - I donât see the need. But to satisfy the audienceâs tastes, there will be. Will she be taken from the street too? Of course. My assistants and I are looking for a new face. She is my wife. Why does she wear that mask? Because she doesnât want to tire her eyesight. Does she have a cornea problem? No! Who knows where she saw that mask thing! She says it keeps her eyes fresh. She was discovered by a motion picture director, so weâre going to Cannes where sheâll do a screen test. - Good! - No, bad! - You wonât allow it? - No, I wouldnât allow it, but she would go anyway! Thereâs nothing I can do. She set her mind on being an actress. She hasnât eaten for 20 days to lose weight. Did she go to the Academy of Dramatic Art? No academy! Weâre fruit vendors. We have a stall at the general market. Until the other day, she sold artichokes. Now sheâs gone crazy and wants to be an actress! You think she has some qualities, temperament? She has temperament, and also a nice body! I am her husband, and I see her intimately, as Mother Nature made her. She is full of flaws, but if I tell her, she screams! Alberto, have you finished talking about personal matters to strangers? They chose me for a screen test and are paying my first class trip. - There must be a reason! - Right! Giovanna, I am worried. We left the stall and the supply room. Donât worry about the supply room, my father will take care of it. I donât trust him. He falls asleep smoking a pipe. He'll start a fire! Alberto, if they give me 5 million for each film, I won't care about supply room! Do you hear her? She doesn't care about the supply room! Donât get your hopes up, you canât be an actress! - Why not? - Youâre full of flaws! What flaws? Sir, she doesnât know any languages, not even Italian. She only went to fourth grade and canât speak. - You even curse! - What are you saying? Well, I was discovered! You canât be successful. You have a hoarse voice like your fatherâs. That isnât important. She could be dubbed. A real actress can speak in her place. - Take that! - Who gives a darn! - What are your Winter plans? - Find a very hot man. - Your favorite sport? - If I say it, Iâll get arrested! Is there a man in your life right now? There are always many. Itâs nice to be able to choose! Madam, donât leave! - Too bad youâre not 20 years younger! - Tell us something else. - Rita! - I thought I wouldnât find you. I was afraid youâd get tired of waiting for me. If this separation lasted longer, I wouldnât have recognized you! - Have I aged so much? - You are very old! I read in a paper that your name has the same age as France. Iâd like to have the same age as France, but unfortunately, so much glory does not give me the chance of seeing you. - You couldâve seen my films. - Youâre false on the screen. Your eyes, your mouth... The opposite of the way you are with me. How am I with you? No! You want to kiss Rita Elmont? With this dress, I can still feel the looks of people. Rita... - I must tell you something important. - Not now. Whatever it is, tell me the last day, before parting. - But... - No, please! I want to stay close to you now. I am afraid. Iâm very afraid of everything. If we had been Eskimos, weâd have had a very long night. Six months of darkness! And many words to say I love you. You want to take my wife with these nudists? - Whatâs wrong with it? - Letâs go! No! If you donât like this place, there are others. I donât take my wife to such performances! But you would go by yourself! On my Sicilian honor, no! Donât make it obvious youâre southerners. Try to behave as normal people. You provincial people are always noticed abroad! What is here? This place is called "Double Face". There are shows and attractions. Come on. - Wait. Iâll go check. - Yes. There is nothing piquant. Iâll wait here with her. But keep apart! I wonât move. - You married an idiot! - What? He knows all about life. Yes! You can tell heâs a man of the world! - We can go inside. - May we? Letâs go. But you're responsible for everything. Alright. Keep your hands down! A table for three. They are elegant, but in our parts they are more modern. - Sit down. - Again! - You like it? - Yes. Bring us three scotches. Their rear ends are naked! How disgusting! Lower your eyes, Adelina! This is the "Double Face". Every medal has an opposite side. Your eyes! - Isn't she hot with that fur? - There're many lunatics in France! She is getting undressed. Sheâs naked! Then sheâs an artist! You take my wife here? Letâs go, Adelina! - Mr. Cinquemani! - What a disgrace! Iâll wait for him here and kill him when he comes out! - Leopoldo, please... - What is going on? You want to corrupt Adelina! Adelina? Iâll be truthful. I donât like your wife. You don't like my wife? To make you happy, Iâll say I like her. Iâll accompany her home, then return and give you a lesson! - Leopoldo, come. - What lesson? Idiot! Scoundrel! If you return to Sant'Agata di Militello, Iâll shoot you! Adelina, cheat on him! What an idiot! What is going on, dear? - I am ruined. - Did you lose at roulette? No. I argued with the two people met on the train. Now they'll return home, and tell my uncle that I'm fine. - What are you worried about? - Money! - I am here. - To do what? - Stay here with us. - No. You can only help me one way. Like this! Regrets? I always cured them with bank accounts. Donât write it. Itâs too costly a medicine for your readers. - For that contest, I thought... - You thought? It is a mortal strain! Go on. Telegrams are my secret weapons, 20 Lira a word. When I took over Cotoni, I sent a telegram to the Managing Director. He sold me his shares and began working for me. - What if he refused? - I knew he couldnât. Even Doriana arrived with a telegram. She was very close to a friend of mine, an industrialist. I telegraphed her to join me on a cruise, and she came. Thatâs how great loves begin! He loves telling this story! If you want, you can write it. You are judging me, but donât have the courage to speak. Doriana likes remembering the milestones of her career. You tell them. You know them better than I do! It is difficult to know women. Maybe I donât know them, but I wouldnât be able to treat them like a... Like a scoundrel? Excuse me. How hypocritical! They think things but are silent! Excuse me. Iâd like to tell you something as a friend. For what reason? Would you be so proud as to refuse sincere help? I donât need help. Donât behave as a kid. Go back to him before he kicks you out. Donât worry, he is not my boss. He's mine! That is why he can afford to say what he wants. - You hate him, right? - I hate him? Oh, no! It is a luxury that you and I cannot afford. - Where is director Maestri? - Back there. Giovanna, this environment makes me sick! - Mr. Maestri is waiting for you. - Yes. We are late! I have a lump here. Hold my stuff. Donât move from here. Stay put. You stay put, Giovanna! Donât be upset! Donât get sick or you'll get it from me too! Excuse me. Here is the lady from Rome. - Good morning, sir! - Good morning. Pleased to meet you. Should I get undressed right away? Look at her! Why do you do it, Giovanna? Tiberio, what are we looking for? A girl who is suffering, who is miserable. What did you bring me? Madam, I hate telling you, but you look very healthy. I'll flash the "horns" to chase away bad luck. Go ahead. - Let me see her in a bathing suit. - Yes. Alberto... - Wake up! - What is it? Bring my bag. The director wants to see me in a bathing suit. Here it is. Hurry up. - Donât get agitated. - Here it is. Okay? - Donât you have a two piece? - Isnât that one alright? You canât see anything with this! - I said to bring a two piece! - What do you want to see? They know what they need to see! I should have brought the two piece. But you didnât let me bring it! You are so stubborn! - You always scold me! - Silence! - Tiberio, what is it? - They donât have a two piece. - We donât have a two piece. - We donât have it! - Do you always repeat what I say? - Do you want to see her naked? Who are you? Her husband. I donât want to see her in a two piece. I'm even embarrassed like this! She doesnât have to get undressed. Walk, madam. Please. - Did they bleach your hair? - What do you care? Turn around. Turn around. There. Thatâs it. - What should I do? - Ingrid. Get next to her. Can she be okay? I think she is too short and too fat. Go, Ingrid. When you donât like something, it begins to interest me! Madam, can you stay here a few days? - I canât decide so quickly. - Alberto, can we stay? You ask me? I donât know. Come on. Donât make a fuss! We shouldnât have left Rome! To come here, we had to leave the stall and the supply room. Dad is there! He's senile! He falls asleep with a lit pipe and we find him roasted! If there is any hope... There are many contestants, I need to think about it. I may get an illumination tonight. Maybe he will choose me! - What do you say, Alberto? - You always decide! - Then Iâll see you tomorrow. - Of course. - Goodbye. - Do you always frown like this? Why? - Tiberio... Tiberio! - Here I am, sir. - What do you say? - Youâre asking me? Careful of these guys looking at you, they even put their hands on you! I am capable of defending myself! - Listen... - Are you talking to me? - No, to your husband. - To me? Mr. Maestri wants to talk to you. Can you go to his villa at 3:00? - To the villa? - Yes. Possibly alone. Alone? If the answer is no, tell me right away. Letâs not waste time. I donât know a thing. Go to the villa and you'll have the answer. - Here is the address. - Yes. Tell Mr. Maestri that if he discards her, I don't give a... - Letâs hope for the best! - Bye, dear! - See you. - What did he say? - Not to get your hopes up. - Why? They are all learned people, all with bleached hair! Repeat it again. Who am I? An ordinary girl from Maryland who doesnât know she is Rita Elmont. Who is Rita Elmont? I donât know her! Will I see you in a year or not? You forgot that before leaving you I must tell you something. - Tomorrow. - No... Tell me now. I am so happy, that Iâm willing to accept bad news. - Itâs not bad news! - No? Iâve decided to leave my wife. - For me? - Yes. Arenât you afraid of ruining your life? I despise the life I have led until now. The one youâll live with me will be very bitter. - Bitter? - Theyâll call you "Mr. Elmond". You will be considered an appendix of the famous star. A flea in the fur of the âroyal tigerâ! - That wonât happen to us. - Youâll hate me, Maurizio. I would hate myself if I didnât leave everything for you. But... If you donât want it... Of course I do! What happens to others wonât happen to us. - We just have to want it. Right? - Yes. Your children? - When are you returning to Cannes? - Tomorrow. Morand, my lawyer, will join me at the hotel. I hope to take care of everything in a few hours. We can finally end the hypocritical phase of this matter, and stop having to hide. Will your wife give you a divorce? She can ask anything she wants. She will have it. - Weâll send this to the D'amicos. - Didnât you argue with them? Theyâll see we went to the French Riviera and die of envy. Write your name this big! Waiter, the bill! It is 900. My wallet! The clip is there but the money is gone! - It was here. - Iâll pay. Stop! Women do not pay. Yes, pay. I even had my good luck horn! Maybe you left everything at the hotel. The hotel bill is rising. We must cancel immediately! Weâll never return to Sant'Agata di Militello. - Weâll stay here forever! - Let's make out a report. I donât want to have anything to do with the law! I didnât want to leave on Friday the 17th. - Letâs telegraph Mama. - No! This must not be known! Whatâs wrong with it? Granddad Calogero would not believe the theft story. He'd say I'm stupid and take away the tuna fishing nets. - Are you hungry? - Iâm thinking about it. This French bread is so long. It surely isnât good. Leopoldo, look who is here! Iâd rather starve to death than get close to that guy! - It smells good! - Itâs lobster. You think they understand that Iâve no more money? Many people do that here. They leave their bags in the hotel and some friend goes to pay. - I owe you 50,000 Francs. Was such a big tip necessary? Itâs a gentlemanâs gesture. Sit down a minute. Did we ruin your day? No. I was getting bored. My girlfriend is busy today. - You have a girlfriend here? - I take other menâs girlfriends! This year I picked up a lady who is an aristocrat. You only think of one thing! Yes, I always think of that. Monotonous! Adelina, is which suitcase is my pyjama? Why do you need it? We donât even know where weâll sleep! Your husband wants to show us his legs! Weâll spend the night on this bench. Wow! The man from Rome is here. Even the guy with the bleached hair! - Come. - How cool! Mr. Maestri is waiting for you. - Sir, look. - Itâs you! - Bravo, bravo... - What a marvelous place! - You like it? - Darn! Itâs a paradise! - Do you live here always? - About 15 days a year. How lovely! The sea, the pool, splashes! - May I take the speedboat? - Yes, dear. Do you remember her? You met her this morning. Sheâs one of the contestants. Mr. Maestri, my wife is not suited, right? Listen, my dear, Iâve had a terrible day. I thought a lot about it. Your wife is not suited. Youâre right. You donât have to apologize. I told her. "What do you want to do? Be an actress?" "You canât. You have a hoarse voice!" How can you be so natural? What did you say? I donât know. Did you hear what a marvel? - Come here! We are not playing! - Yes! - Did you hear him? - Yes, we did. Well? Take a good look at him! It's true! Bravo. A young Jean Gabin! - Jean Gabin? - Yes. Did you ever think of being an actor? I don't count a thing. You have decided, and a lawyer won't make you change your mind. I hope Agnese is happy that I chose you. Your wife would have gladly done without lawyers. Is it possible she has nothing to say? She realizes what is about to happen. She can't say you're right, but she understands you. If it's not love, at least it's affection! - That makes me uneasy. - Were you expecting a battle? No, but I thought I'd argue, justify myself. A born fighter! Your ancestors fought in the Crusades, Agnese's ancestors built ships for the Crusades. You can't expect her to have your same reactions. She is reason, you are instinct. If she'd used reason in the past, we wouldn't have come to this. The time for "ifs" is over! If she had understood you, if she'd let you live your life. And you too. If you had tried to understand her... It's easy to hypothesize! I want to ask you to please stay close to them. You know you don't have to ask me. - Are you leaving in two days? - I think so. Right now the commitments of... Rita Elmont, Duchess of Mont-Bret! The name sounds important! If you need me, I am here. There are papers to sign. I'll bring them this evening. Mr. Morand... - Yes? - Can you come a moment? Please. Excuse me. There is always much disorder in my life! - You know who I am? - I sometimes go to the movies. And Maurizio talked a lot about you. You don't approve? How can I not approve? I am Maurizio's lawyer. You are avoiding to say what you think. Thank you. What are you looking for in me? An alley? No, someone who listens to me with much comprehension. You're not certain about your decisions? It doesn't happen often, but this time Maurizio decided. Are you a victim of events? I didn't say that. Tell me honestly what you think. I don't approve Maurizio. I could say I understand him, if I wanted to pay compliments. Do you understand me? You don't need to be approved or disapproved. You don't like me, huh? Liking someone is not contemplated in the civil code, nor in the regulations of my club. They are the only texts I go by. - Good-day. - Is Maurizio's wife beautiful? - She is his wife. - Do you know her? She is my sister. What a turn of events! It'd be successful in Broadway. The best line of the play. Maybe it's a play, but not for everyone! What do you think of women? One must be stupid to be liked by women. - Or very rich! - A phone call from Milan. You want something to drink? It's warm. Want some ice? No, thanks. Aren't you sticking yourself out a bit much? For so little? I should've returned it, since the first day. I waited so long. Hire low paid unemployed people, so they'll decide in Rome. Who cares about unions! Involve the usual papers. If someone protests, suspend the publicity. How much would your paper pay for important documents? They prove that he supplied arms to the Chabo rebels. If I sold them, I could get rid of him! I don't know. I'd have to see them. Maybe he has to leave. We'll discuss it later. Aren't you drinking too much? It is the story of four youngsters who fall in love with a woman. She was to be my wife, but you chose a Swedish woman! They are young and naive. For the love of this woman, they kill a friend. They later repent having killed him, enlist in the Foreign Legion, and swear eternal hatred towards women. It is lovely, and has a profound meaning. It's right. The cause of almost all trouble is women. Which is my part? You are Paolo, the man who is killed. - Are you afraid of the camera? - I'm not afraid of anything! Bravo! But Paolo is a boxer. His nose is broken from so many punches. I've have it broken. I'll do everything you want! Can you stay here a few days? I'll leave everything and stay here. I feel that you could be Paolo. I must comb you, I must dress you, I must transform you. You must become as I imagine. You have only one scene, but it's long and very lovely. - You dance a tango with the actress. - They kill me right away? It's a brief part, but it's the most moving role of the film. I am in love with it. - Do you know how to dance? - I can dance and sing. You could sing in a hushed voice during the tango. - I wish! - Let me hear how you sing. Excuse me, sir. I have a hoarse voice too. It's nothing. We'll have you study if need be. We're always at the market shouting, "Broccoli! Artichokes!" If I have a chance as an actor, I assure you that my beast's voice will become civil again. Good. You want something to drink? - Is this okay? - Bravo! - Giovanna... - Well? What did the director say? That you are beautiful. You are proportioned. You are elegant. - You have a lovely figure. - Really? But you are not interesting. - I'm not interesting? - That's what the director said. You are not interesting. Who did he choose? The Swedish woman. She has a horse's face! What is so interesting about her? I don't know what to say. Cinema plays those sorts of tricks. A girl shows up looking like a horse, but when they photograph her, she looks like a doll. It's cinema. The more flaws you have, the better you look. That director has strange tastes! Let him be, Giovanna! Let him be, because he knows his profession. He knows who is suited, and who isn't. If he says you aren't interesting, accept it. - Don't despair. - I'm not. I tried. If it had gone well, I'd have earned 5 million. You know what? So much the better! - You say that because it went badly. - What's in the envelope? A French beret. I'll show you. Are you happy it went badly? It went badly for you, and will go well for someone else. Who do I look like with this beret on? - Your grandfather. - My grandfather? Don't you remember the photograph of your emigrant grandfather? He had the same beret and the same puffy face. Maybe you're wrong about the face. - You're packing? You want to go? - Of course! You don't? - What will we do here? - Isn't it nice? We never left Rome. Do you mind having a week's vacation? What about the supply room and the stall? Your dad is there. You complained my dad would set the place on fire with his pipe! You wanted to leave when we arrived, and now you want to stay! I want you to enjoy a week on the French Riviera. You don't like it? Aren't you happy, my little wife? If you're happy... If I'm happy... It's the circumstances! Thanks for having helped us go out together. - It was my duty as a lawyer. - And as a friend. Miss Elmont! Rita, you don't know how much I care for you! Wait! Sorry, I'm a bit tipsy. You don't know me, but I know you. I'm the wife of your second husband. I've always wanted to meet you! Thanks for liberating me. I was never able to tell you. - Let's go drink a scotch. - Please sit down with us. This is probably poisoned by them. Let's go to the bar. The gentlemen can wait. Men must always wait. You see? Another inconsolable divorcee. Giorgio was different. Boring, but different. Sometimes he wasn't so boring. You could have married again after our divorce. Again? He married a girl from Boston right away. Did you know that? You forget what you leave behind. I hope your wife won't make a tragedy either. She certainly won't drink to forget! Ladies and gentlemen, your attention! Here's the evening's surprise. Bambi, the man who is more seducing than a woman. Speaking of the same husband... an endless topic. Endless, but of no interest to me. Nor for Rita. I'm sure of it. We both made a mistake. Your children? - They must have forgotten me by now. - No! My children owe you a lot. Let's dance. - What are you doing? - Are you ashamed? - A great actress is never ashamed! - Rita, let's go. - You want to dance, madam? - You want to drink? Let's go to the bar. One can't be happy for long. Don't you agree, Maurizio? I am always happy with you. I don't ask for more. They can't sleep here. The pensione is all booked. The hotel is your mother's, but the room is mine. Let me be. - And us? - I must please them because I must convince them to say they didn't see me. Alright. But send them away soon. Thanks, dear. - What are they doing? - Keep calm. Everything is almost ready. - What did she say? - Nothing. She said goodbye. - Was she talking about my wife? - In France they do as they please. They are dirty people! We shouldn't have come here! I am doing you a favor. Would you do one for me? You ask me for a favor in such a moment? - I am ready. You can enter. - We're coming. Just a moment! I must check. - Nicola? - Don't bother about him. Button up. Go to bed. Cover up. - Is this okay? - More. You can enter. Goodbye, Adelina! - Get an armchair. - I'm not sleeping. I'm no idiot! You're afraid that while you sleep, I... - Let's play a game of cards. - Alright. - Raise them. - I was telling you... - Will you stop it? - Why? I can't sleep! Lovely party and lovely people, huh? Don't ask the opinion of others. You decide what is nice. I like this party because there will be fireworks. The only entertainment of my town! Write this in my biography... I have the same feelings for my fellow men, that people had for me when I was a poor boy looking for food. It will be the only truth of our novel! When one has lived like this, it's difficult to like others. - Here are the fireworks! - How lovely! Over there too! Write this too. I supplied arms to the rebels of Chabo, who lost. But also to the nationalists, who won. So in the end, I won! - Did you know, dear? - No! Doriana thinks she has me in hand for some letters she stole. They are worth nothing. They are trash paper. So don't be too impressed when she tells you this story. What if I already told him? I'm leaving early tomorrow, and leaving you two alone. Can I come with you? Why lose the occasion of having a fling with him? - It's an order or a suggestion? - You are a lovely couple. You're a gentlemen and won't take advantage of my hospitality. And Doriana is too intelligent to take such risks. - Thanks for your trust. - You're welcome. Who is it? Police? I won't surrender! PÃ©pÃ© le Moko does not surrender. - What are you doing? - I don't know, I feel strange. I am agitated and can't sleep. You're up at dawn with that beret on your head! I don't know, must be the cuttlefish I ate last night. I know you well, it wasn't the cuttlefish. There's something you don't want to tell me. - Didn't you see how he looked at me? - Who? The director. Instead of looking at you, he stared at me. - Why? - I don't know. He says I've an interesting face, that I look like a young Jean Gabin. Who are you? You didn't understand? Come on, pretty lady! He wants to launch me, make me become a great actor! - Would you accept? - Wouldn't you have accepted? Instead he wants me! Do you mind? You always unloaded crates at the market, now you want to be an actor? And the others? How did they become great actors? Who are you talking about? Clark Gable used to be a forest ranger. Gary Cooper was unemployed. Kirk Douglas was an acrobat. And Jean Gabin was a mason. You are comparing yourself to Jean Gabin? Do you think I was born to work behind a vegetable stall? Only because I never manifested my feelings to anyone. Every time I went to the movies and saw Marlon Brando with his leather jacket and gun, I felt a lump here and thought: "Who are you, Marlon Brando? Excuse me. I am a stranger. You want to try me? Just once. Have me do a screen test. See if my face is alright. Try me. I'll show you what I can do!" He's become mad! What did they do to him? My wife, don't be envious. It went badly for you and well for me. My moment has come, and nobody better stop me! I don't allow you to talk to me like that! Take off the beret. - I'll take you to the station. - Come here! You are taking me? You've no more right to say that! You were the boss until yesterday and I obeyed because the stall and supply room belong to your father. I am independent now, Giovanna! I have a fact to exploit and a career ahead of me! Be quiet! If you speak, I'll slap your face. I hope they realize who you are, and that it goes badly! You want to bring me bad luck? Bad luck has nothing to do with it. I know you well. With your head, it'll go badly for sure! This head will give me my independence! And it will open the road to glory! Take this! You got dressed in front of him! - He is sleeping. - He could be pretending. Nicola! Nicola! Did you see? He is awake! Now go to bed. Where are you going dressed like that? - For a walk. - You go around France by yourself? - Be quiet! - Now go to bed. Bye. She has picked up the habits of the continent. My grandfather kept his wife in chains! There's Cap-Ferrat. There's Chateau de Madrid where we'll have lunch. There is Monte Carlo and there is Italy. - You could have asked me! - Yes. Will you give me a kiss? Come. I'll drive again. - Here we are. - Good-day. It's so nice today that I'm not even hungry! - I've never been so hungry. - Me either. I am! Once, during the war, we were... Of course! During the war I was hungrier than I am now. - During the war and after. - Even after? Yes, even after, when everyone was eating. If you've never really starved, you don't know what it means. You don't have that worry now. You think I do it to have fun? Every day I think of the 10 story building where my family lives. It is a royal palace compared to the house where I was born! Every night I must obtain something more to forget it. Alright. Can you forget so easily? Just by following that... Thank you for such a delicate expression! Are you afraid to say things as they are? I think it isn't difficult to start a life that's... Honest? That is the right word! Maybe with you! I should abandon everything? I travel! I've a yacht, fur coats, jewels, villas... You pay a lot for it! Day after day. Can't you avoid reminding me every time? Since you've been with us, you just judge and condemn. - You don't have that right? - Why do you say "us"? - You're so tied to him? - So what? It's not your business! - You always create complications. - You create them! You aren't happy now, and you'll never be! Darn! If you were content, we'd spend lovely days... Sure. Hiding from him! Alright. Then everyone in his place, like the first day. Alright. Now take another one. Don't just sit there! The crowds are gathering! I can't stand curious people. Go! Call Alberto. Alberto, come! - Where are you going with that hair? - To take pictures. Don't you see how ridiculous you are? I do everything the director says. - Am I alright like this? - Cute, very cute! Come here. Come... here... That's it. You look very nice! Now get close to her so we can see how you look together. - What should I do? - Kiss her neck. Give her a kiss! Take it. Her reaction. Embrace him. - Abandon her. - Where? Abandon her on the banister. Down... lower... Dolly, crane. Come up... Face to face, cheek to cheek. Now say "cheese". Have you finished? - Why? - I am tired! Then go take a walk! I am busy. I can't move until the director tells me to. Ask him if you can leave. Then you're doing it on purpose! You want to argue? Are you envious because she's here? Envious? Look at the people he put next to you! If he chose me, it means I have qualities that you don't! Why don't we test that? Let's take measurements! We don't need a nanny, but an actress! You're an actress? You're a crutch with a horse's face! We aren't at the general market! Hear that? Everyone will know who you are. Broccoli vendor! Go away! You, and all these monkeys! Excuse me. You see what happened? Nothing happened. Let's start from the beginning. How can I? She demoralized me. She does it on purpose. - No... - Yes, I know her! She always tries to be an obstacle, all my life! She boasts about her divorces as an aristocrat of his noble family! We should've left when she arrived. No, attorney Morand shouldn't have accompanied her here. Men are stupid. Who remembers the Academy students? We remember the Academy because some important men were a part of it. Here is Mont-Bret! Maurizio, I read you arrived last in an automobile race. I didn't know the Academy was interested in sports press. Remember Maurizio of Mont-Bret? He was with us the other evening. Yes. I courted him, but wasn't successful. The lady is lovely and sincere. Like Ninon! You're writing a book on the most beautiful women of France? Yes, it's true. I don't know if I should consider Joan of Arc beautiful, and if to consider historical the lady on whose lips a President of the Republic, found his death. I have to chase you to see you. And we're in the same hotel! It's not my fault. You know what my commitments are. I know what your promises were! It's not because of me, that we decided to hide it. I'm ready to tell everyone in this assembly of old-timers. Excuse me, Maurizio! And FerronniÃ¨re? She had a very ugly mole that she hid... Excuse me. I must leave. The photographers are waiting for me. Again? They'll take pictures of me in a bikini, together with Mr. Universe. He, too, in a bikini! Bye! Maurizio! - We never see you. - She's a marvelous woman. Too shameless to be true! No! She's too real to be happy. Something doesn't convince me. Why did they let her leave by herself? A woman like that doesn't need company during the day! I am surprised at you! You've become a gossiper. - When will you decide? - You must do other tests. I will take any test. I'll have my nose and leg broken, I'll jump from the roof... Then come to my villa tonight. I'll have the Swedish girl come too. - What should we do? - Rehearse the tango scene. If you are good, I'll have you sign the contract. Thank you! It will go well. You'll be pleased with me. Here is my wife! She hopes you'll say no to take me to the general market! If she's here, I'm leaving. See you tonight. Thank you very much. You will be pleased with me! Giovanna! Must you always follow me? How much longer must I wait for you? - Did you sign the contract? - It's not something quick! I still have to take the decisive test. What's the decisive test? The director invited me to dinner tonight. The actress is coming, and we'll dance the tango. You'll dance the tango? I don't like these people! They are making a fool of you! Why would they do that? I must take the decisive test... a tango with the actress. It's what the director told me, and I believe it! Alberto... Look at me when I talk to you! I have a doubt. What doubt? What doubt? Don't have doubts if I'll dance a tango with the actress! You must get used to it! If I become famous, you'll see me in movies kissing Silvana Pampanini, Marilyn Monroe... But if it goes badly, I'll return to the general market. - Hello. Is the director here? - Come. He's waiting for you. When he expects visitors, he's always nervous. - Are you Roman? - Can you tell? I sure can! Why are you on the French Riviera? I was a bartender on ships. Mr. Maestri took me with him. - But I am tired. - Really? - You use Brylcreem on your hair? - No! What do you care? Do as you wish! I am melancholy tonight. - Wait. I'll call him. - Yes. Who is he? - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. How cute! Nice and combed. - I always comb it like this now. - Good for you! - What is this? - The Roma team badge. Isn't the actress here? One should never work with actresses! She called to say she has fever and won't come tonight. - She's not coming? - No. - We won't do the tango scene? - What can I say? I'm sorry. If I had known, I'd have brought my wife. - She'd have liked to come. - If we had known... - What should we do now? - Since you are here... If you want to stay, we'll have dinner together. You decide. I don't want to disturb. - Sit down. - Thank you. Many thanks. - You like it here? - It's very lovely! It's fantastic! Oh, God! The lights went out! No! We're having a candlelight dinner. You never had a candlelight dinner? Well, no. Is that the fashion on the French Riviera? - Yes. You like it? - Very much! What a lovely life! I don't feel comfortable. My wife is alone at the hotel. She is locked inside! What are you afraid of? It was tough to marry her. I must care for her now. Didn't Adelina fall in love with you the moment she saw you? I courted her for a year. Each Saturday, a serenade, on Sunday, a sermon and Communion. And every day, a two hour walk under her balcony! You must have flat feet. How many shoes did you wear out? Twelve pair! During the tuna period, for each fishing session, I sent a half a ton of tuna to her family. It is a monotonous menu! And yet her father consented, thanks to the tuna. Her father liked tuna. But did Adelina? You don't create a great effect! A man is not measured by his height! When someone has a passionate and faithful temperament... You're morale is good tonight! Must be this air. Really? Would you be willing to cheat on Adelina? I give you my Sicilian word: yes! Come with me. Let me lead you. Is it always so boring here? Don't worry. Where I take you, something always goes on. Waiter! Two places. Come. I still have a few thousand Francs. - Would you do me a favor? - What? When you return to town, don't tell my uncle you saw me in Cannes. - Why? - What? Why should I become your accomplice? It doesn't cost you anything! I say and do what I want without accepting impositions or blackmail. - I am all one piece! - And what a nice piece! - What is going on? - Now you'll see. You would deserve covering your eyes! There's a competition now for the most beautiful legs. - Dancers? - No, girls. - Real girls? - Yes! There is a 100,000 Francs prize. This one will win! Cinquemani, let's go! They make my head spin! Bravo! Bravo! She's exciting! Beautiful! They must give you a gold medal! Lovely! Beautiful! Touch of butter! I was wrong in marrying a Sicilian! Bravo! She is a statue! I'd give you 10 years of my life! Adelina? Button up! - Adelina! - Leopoldo! - You dishonored me! - I did it for the 100,000 Francs. - To be able to go home. - How will I return home? With a cuckold's horns? You made me a cuckold! Hello? Am I talking to Rome? Let me speak! - Dad, do you hear me? - Yes, but far away. It's 1:30 and he's not back yet! - There is the decisive test tonight. - What is that? He went to the villa to dance with the actress. You sent him by himself? He isn't by himself. The director is there. Be careful, my child. That man is shrewd! Oh, no! The problem isn't the actress. What are you worried about? I can't explain it. You are too far away. - You wouldn't understand. - I'll go to sleep. Good night. Right. Dad! Put out the pipe before going to sleep. I must talk to my husband. It's 2:00 a.m. and he's not back yet. Why? I'm sorry. I was given the order not to disturb. The director is very nervous. He'll get angry with me. I don't care. I'm nervous too! Where is my husband? - What're you doing, Alberto? - Rehearsing the tango. You're dancing with a man? We're rehearsing the tango scene. What are you doing? Dancing with my husband? We had to rehearse the scene with the actress. Why isn't she here? Madam, but I don't tolerate interference in my work. What do you want from my husband? - May I know what you want? - Why did you come? Do you realize that my destiny depends on this test? - It's true. - Have you become an idiot? - Excuse me. - Where are you going? Relax. If you came to argue with your husband, I've no part in it. I'll kill him! What're you doing? What is going on? Don't you see what is happening? - No, I don't. - Let's go. Giovanna, why didn't the actress come? I'll tell you one day when you are older. - Where are you going? - To say goodbye to the director. Let's go! We made a terrible impression with him! Come on! Where have you been? I looked for you all morning. I kept our pact: do what you want, so I'm taking a walk. I must talk to you. - I'm coming with you. - You're coming with me? - What for? - I don't know. Because I'm angry! - You'd leave everything? - You want me to come with you? I have no yachts or villas. - I work to make a living. - I know. - You think we can be happy? - I'm afraid of saying "yes". Since I've been with you two... With you... words have a different meaning, more ambiguous. See you here in two hours. Alright? Leave me alone! Who took my jewels? One of the first things I taught you was not to scream. - Where are my things? - In their place. - There is nothing! - In fact! I'd be an imbecile if I didn't take precautions with people like you. You want to keep me tied to your dirty money! I can say that it's dirty because I know how I earned it. For you, it's good money! You are free, the door is open. I won't keep you. You stole everything: fur coats, jewels, clothes! Clothes aren't necessary in love. If you love each other, you won't need a wardrobe. You don't know how much I hate you! It is the first, sincere emotion you feel for me! You'd send me away like a maid? Maids are respectable people. I would respect your new love if you didn't want to remain attached to your former lovers. That is lack of courage. It's something I despise. Men like you don't give severance money? Ask the workers and the employees of my companies. I never denied anyone what was owed to him. But I give nothing to who decides to leave. It's legal. I'm going anyway. I don't need you. I'll leave you all alone. Like a dog! Smile. Rita, turn around, please. Very good! - Enough! - Another one. - That's enough. - One moment, please! We did everything that can be done in a pool! Hello! Nobody is here now. You can stop being a tiger. There's always something exciting in the crowd surrounding me! - Do you find it exciting? - Miss Elmont? A late-comer? No. If possible, I want to photograph you in a different way. In a deep sea diving outfit. Without going under water. You are so young that I can't refuse anything. But first let's get something to drink. Come. Here's a photograph of Rita Elmont choosing toys for the children of her new victim, a Frenchman whose name is a secret. Enough! Go on with these clown acts! Who is that madman? I barely know him. He's been around me for a few days. Shall we take a picture with the toys? It is no longer necessary. Nicola, here are the 50,000 Francs you lent us. Thank you. You can send them to me. You may need it. Don't you think? Now she has the money and is the boss. - I'm just a puppet! - The world hasn't collapsed! - Adelina is a good girl. - She was! Forget it. Don't insist. I don't want to make peace now. - What do you want to do? - I'll stay here! - I'll perform every evening. - Naked? - Naked? - Yes. - You'd have the courage... - Yes! Don't you think of me? You don't think I care for you? It's the reason I'm so grumpy... Go on. I am practically family. I do this because I care for Adelina. She is too beautiful for me. I don't deserve her. Is that okay? You wanted to know? Now laugh, if you want! - Leopoldo! - Leave me alone! Don't do that. Let's go back home! - Cinquemani! - What do you want now? Come here. Sit down. - You know my father? - I know him, and knows he gives you lots of money to study in Milan. He was very worried about your illness. Did you limp? No, I walked very well. I wrote it to have him send me half a million. He wanted to come and assist you, but it was the tuna season. It was the right time for the accident. He couldn't come. When you return to town, say you don't know anything. That was the favor you wanted to ask me! Favor? I order you not to tell anyone you saw me here. I don't accept orders! Then you risk having me return to Sant'Agata di Militello after a 10 year absence to tell the whole town that I saw Adelina dance naked in front of 200 people! Naked! Excuse me, Adelina, but... - Are you blackmailing me? - Yes, sir! You know what I say to you? Alright! It is a mistake to wait for a woman in the street. I don't know what woman you're talking about. The one who won't come. Let me speak. I suppose you've been to the circus sometimes. The tamers use a whip to tame tigers, and they don't take it home like a cat. Each animal has its destiny. Doriana is a stage animal. - Leave her in the cage. - With you? Yes, with me, my luxury, my laziness, my pride, and sometimes a whipping to remind her that I am the boss. You wanted the satisfaction of coming to tell me. Your proud cynicism! Don't repeat what everyone says about me, form your own opinion. This is about an elderly man who likes a girl, and a girl who'd run away with you, but knows how to reason. - Reason? - Yes. Just out of curiosity... How did you convince Doriana to stay with you? I took away her fur coats and jewels. If she really loved you, it wouldn't matter. I would've left it with her, and you'd have sent it back. But unfortunately for you, I was not mistaken. I cannot waste any more time. Goodbye. Farewell! "Leopoldo Cinquemani." There're imbeciles who throw money around like peanuts! It does 500 kilometers an hour. Want to try it? Don't bother praising it. I already bought it! I just wanted to show you the performance of our new jewel. It is not yours anymore, and I will never use it. - You don't like it? - I needed it. It seems that a rich man has to have a personal plane. Have it kept at disposal. We'll use it some day. You should get a license and pilot it. But without me! - Look! - I see. It's gorgeous! It's twice as big as ours. -You remember it from last year! -Yes. It belongs to Dimitri Flaerthy. Right. He has arrived. Your moment has also arrived. This time you can change for the best. You think? No, I won't leave you. I don't feel like it anymore. We even get used to people we think are indifferent, and to those we think we hate. So... you are staying? - What do you think of France? - Too many beautiful women. - What is your greatest desire? - Becoming a Marines Lieutenant. Have you ever done something crazy for a man? For attorney Morand. Because of him, I gave up the best contract of my life! Thank you. Miss Elmont... She decided, believe me. Pierre, please, buy that doll and that bear, and take them to Nicole and Patou. Tell them they are gifts from a good friend. A friend they don't know, but who did a lot for them. I will come home in a few days. Tell Agnese too. I'll be back in a few days. Sometimes good luck happens to those who don't think of it. I almost had a career as the greatest actor of the moment. But I had to do a small, decisive test. How did the decisive test go? How did it go? You see her? - Who is she? - My wife. She did it. Right during the decisive test, she came and stopped me. I am curious about something. What is this decisive test? You are a musician and don't know much about cinema, but today, a director, especially a neorealist one, when he finds a new face, he needs to create it, to open his... Alberto, forget it! Why? Alright. Forget it.
