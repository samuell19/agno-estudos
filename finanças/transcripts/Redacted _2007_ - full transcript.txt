Welcome to the oven, aka Camp Carolina: our home away from home in this godforsaken country. What I can't convey, via this video journal is the incredible heat and the local smells. Oh, my God, it stinks. Yo, Mustangs! Yo! On 3, give me a smile! 1, 2, 3! But let me introduce myself. My name is Angel Salazar. Private Salazar. I'm that poor Latino filmmaker that did not get into USC. Hey! Papi Chulo, what's goin' on over here, man? Ai! Qu? chulo! Enter McCoy. Hace calor! I'm tryin' to make a video. Oh, yeah? Tryin' to make-- You know what just happened to your video? Yeah? Just got a whole hell of a lot sexier, baby. Yes, it did. Sexy is here. Making a video of me making a video of you. Yeah, yeah. You're making a video of me making a video of you. Uh-huh. Why is that? Getting it all down because this might be the last video that either of us makes. Is that so? Mm-hmm. Well, I'll tell you what. Let's make a deal, then. You and me. Seriously. All right. If I die in this war, I want you to get all my videos, all right? Okay. And if you die in this war, I'll get your videos, your camera, and your girlfriend's phone number. My girlfriend's number? Yeah, your girlfriend's phone number. What's Mrs. McCoy going to be saying about that? This is my brother. Come on, man. All right, that's a deal. Who do you think I am? That's a deal. You know what I like about you, Sally? Yeah? Besides absolutely nothing? Absolutely nothing. And your sweet and sunny disposition. No, no, no. It's not about sunny disposition, McCoy. It's about telling it how it is. Oh, is that what it's about? It's about telling it how it is. You want to hear telling it-- Hey, hey! Hey! Over here, over here. Please. Focus on what's beautiful. Thank you. Do you want to hear me telling it how it is? Y'all want to hear telling it how it is? What do you all think's gonna be the first casualty of this entire conflict, huh? You. That's right! It's not going to be Rush or Flake or "Don't ask, don't tell" over here. You know what it's gonna be? What? Do you know what it's going to be? Talk to me! You know what it's gonna be? What's it gonna be? It's gonna be the truth. Come on, now. Just tellin' it like it is. You suck! What are you talking about? Ah, here endeth the lesson. That was some sad, depressing stuff right there. All right, let me finish. Let me finish. All right. So I joined up to get the money for college, and a better chance at film school. Yeah. I mean, I'm going to be a combat vet, for chrissakes, right? And with this awesome war film in hand, they got to take me. Oh, yeah. So while I'm over here, I'm gonna be shootin' whatev-- ...whatever the fuck goes on. Which so far-- Get-- Which so far is basically nothing. Now, our squad mans a checkpoint outside Samarra. It's all day long in the boiling hot sun, wearing 120 pounds of gear, checking out cars for weapons and bombs and shit? This deployment is unspeakably underwhelming. The only insurgent we found so far is one big fuckin' rat we chased out of here last night. Oh, that rat died. So, get-- Get off. 'Cause I fucked it to death. So don't be expecting any Hollywood action flick. It's not going to be smash cuts, no adrenaline-pumping soundtrack, no logical narrative to help you make sense of it. Basically, here, shit happens. You want soda? No. No. I scored some for one M.R.E. Just go. Go on. Get out of here. Go on. Jesus. He doesn't let up. As you see, we set up road signs. They're vividly colored, highly visible, and impossible to miss. They're written in English and Arabic, and they inform every single driver that they're entering a checkpoint. Get out of the car. Come up over here. Quickly. Let's go, people. Go, quick! Get in line here. Right there. That's it, that's it. Let's go, people. Yell out. Arms up. Arms down. Tell him to open the trunk. Open the trunk. Let's go, people. Come on. Come on, move. Don't go in. It's open, it's open. Take your hands out of there. Is he afraid of the dog? Afraid of the dog? Who gives a fuck? Fuck him. Come over here. Come over here. Come on, stay in line. Eyes front. Sally? All right, Blix. The car is yours. Good. Come here. Come back, come back here. In there. In there. In there. Okay. Up here, up here. In. In. In, in, in. In. In, in, in, boy. Come on. I need you in there. In there. Come on, boy. Wait. Up here. Up here. In there. In there. Up here. Up here. Come on. Good boy, Kevin. Good boy, Kevin. Good boy. All right, come here. Back through here. It's all clear. All right. Tell them they can go in the car and drive off slowly. That's Gabe Blix. He's from Virginia. He doesn't talk a lot 'cause he's got his nose in a book all the time. Yo, Gabe, what you readin' over there? I'm reading a book, Salazar. All right. What's it about? It's about-- Dude, no, seriously. What are you doing? What are you doing right now? Who are you? I'm-- I want to get your opinion. Okay, if you have that camera, then you're part of the media, and we're under strict orders not to speak with you, yeah? Don't call me media, asshole! Come on, just tell me what you're reading. Tell me about it. Dude, no. You're gonna make some, kinda like commie rendition of our mission-- Hey! No, no, no, no, no. This is about the truth, bro. This is about what's going down. This is the truth 24/7. This camera, it never lies. Yeah, the-- Dude, that is bullshit. Okay? 'Cause that's all that camera ever does. Just show me the title of the book. "Appoin--" Really? All right. So, you know, what's it got to say about Samarra? Nothing. Nothing. No, nothing. It's about this, like, guy, he's this country club guy, and he gets really drunk on Christmas Eve, and he throws his drink in his boss' face. And everybody in the whole city that he lives in, like right outside of Philadelphia-- Okay, but what's it got to do with Samarra? It-- Nothing. The opening makes reference to Samarra, but besides that, you know, it's just like, classic cover situation What? Don't judge a book by its cover. Right. Basically. All right. So, uh-- Whoa, when's the appointment? You don't want to know. I do want to know! Dude, you don't-- This is about books! I don't have anything about books. This is literary. This is good. The appointment, uh-- Do you want me to just read you the introduction? Perfect. Perfect. Give me something good. Okay, let me find it. The introduction's actually not by John O'Hara. It's by W. Somerset Maugham. Perfect. And-- You have no idea who that is, do you? Not at all. Didn't think so. Okay. It's called Death Speaks. Oh, wait, it's spooky? All right. Read that right into the camera. Go. All right."There was a merchant in Baghdad, who sent his servant to market to buy--" All right, Gabe, wait. Before you start reading that, once you get into it, think about what you're gonna say, and then put some like, you know, some heart behind it. Go! "There was a merchant in Baghdad who sent his servant to market "to buy provisions, and in a little while, "the servant came back, white and trembling, "and said, 'Master, just now, when I was in the marketplace'--" Yeah, this is a little bit boring, bro. This is like-- I need to-- Dude, I don't even want to do this. Hey! Yeah. I got reading, too. Okay. All right, kid. I win. Get out of here. Come on, go. Emshe, emshe. Find your mother. Go find your mother. No. I don't need any hajji slave, all right? I get you anything. You want soda? No. I don't want any fuckin' soda. Hey, hey. Sally, Sally! Ain't you supposed to be saying "action" on me, or something like that? All right. Here we go. I'm Master Sergeant James-- Ohh! It stands for M.R.E.: "Meals Refusing to Excrete." What you doin', Sally? God damn, man! That's shit. You're asking for this. Hey, hey, Sally! Come on, now. All right, you ready? I'm Master Sergeant James Sweet-- Over here. Hey. What's he lookin' at? Boy! Get out of here. Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Full security. Full security. Hey, Ishta! Ishta! Ish-motherfuckin'-ta. Hey, hey. Hey! Get over here, Blake. Oh, oh! Don't be givin' your fuckin' food, man. No. No. Ishta. Ishta. Go. Go. What the fuck is wrong with you, man? Stay away from anything and everything these little midget Ali Babas give you, all right? Yo, why not, Master Sergeant? Why not? See, my black ass has been over here for three goddamn tours, all right? I don't trust anybody over here. Shit. How long have you been over here, Flake? Just a couple months. Just a couple of months. Shit. Got ourselves a goddamn virgin here. Oh! No, I'm not a virgin Yeah, all right. I bet. And what'd you do before that? I just hung out, you know? Fucking around. Gettin' drunk. Tried to stay out of jail. Sally, come on over here. Look at this miserable fuck. This one? Yeah. Got him. Probably suckin' dick for beer money, if it wasn't for the Army. Oh. Look, you're right. I was suckin' dick for beer money. This here is the cream of the Army recruits, right here. Ouch. "Cream" is no joke. You're so goddamn white, boy, you wouldn't wear yourself after Labor Day. All right, tell me, Flynny. Tell me. Like, what was it? You either had to serve time here or stateside? Something like that. Yeah. Well, you want to get your ass back in one piece? I most definitely do. Well, good. Stop lookin' to get yourself killed, then. You chow down on anything these little motherfuckin' ragheads give you, it's like swallowin' an IED I wa-- It's a date. Look at this. Do you think I want to eat this? I wasn't going to eat this. I was trying to be friendly. They don't want to be your friend, slick. They want to piss on your back and tell you that it's raining, all right? Look, trust me. You eat that shit, and next thing you know, you gonna be spittin' up blood. Hey, look alive, soldier. All right? We get back to the house, get yourself a little kitty kitty, how 'bout that? Woof-woof! How can you arrange that? Look alive, look alive! This right here is my motherfuckin' Caucasian. He's mine too! You're my motherfuckin' ese. I am your ese? That's right. Come on. Yo, Master Sergeant. What? We swept by this place yesterday, right? Hell, yeah. Bet your ass we're gonna do it again tomorrow. Because when the sun goes down, these motherfuckin' hajjis come out their ratholes and resow their IED's in different and more surprising places than the day before, and you can bet your ass that these smilin', soccer-playin' shitbirds ain't nothin' but their eyes and ears. Slow down! Slow down. Slow it down. Hey! Stop! Stop the fucking car! Stop! Stop the goddamn car! Sally, we got one! Stop! Stop the god-- Sal! What the fuck? Jesus Christ. Holy shit. Get back! You got to get back. Ishta, ishta. Back 'em up, Sally. Let's go. Come on. Ishta, ishta. Move back from the car! Say hello to B.B. Rush and Reno Flake. Flake is your average grunt, completely in touch with his primal self, He's one of our latest recruits from way down on the bottom of the gumbo barrel. Boy, he discovered his soul mate: B.B. Rush. The guy's dumber than shit, but he's loyal. Now, they only want two things here: to fuck or to fight. And yesterday, Flake blew away his first civilian. Yo, Flake, what you readin'? Oh, yeah? You been gettin' any? Mm. No. All right. I have. All right, fine. Yo, Flake. How do you feel about that hajji you smoked? Well-- All I know is, the only language these sand niggers understand is force. And I'm just the cat to make the introductions. Fuckin' Roger that, man. Oh, but the truth be told? Truth be told, Flake. Truth be told. Truth is, it wasn't everything it's cracked up to be. I mean, I thought my first kill shot would blow my mind, but-- It was nothing. It was like guttin' catfish. Yo. Sarge, you waved that guy to stop, right, that hajji retard? Oh, yeah. This guy, uh-- Yeah, but the problem is that most of these fuckin' people, you know, when you put your hand up? They don't know that that means to stop. You know, most of these Iraqis think that you're wavin' hello. But they fuckin' know what it means now. All I know is... these cats screamed their heads off, screamed his little, lady lungs out, you screamed your beaucoup brains off-- Ha ha. And that car just kept comin', right across that trigger line. What the fuck else am I supposed to do but light 'em up? Light 'em the fuck up. You did your job. All right. But, you know, Flake, you're not gonna win many hearts and minds pumping pregnant women full of lead, though, right? That's true, Sally. Come on. Salazar. I mean, what do you want me to do? Get all teary-eyed and say I'm sorry? "I'm so sorry." My life's been changed forever? My life's been changed forever, fuck. Waxing hajjis is like stomping cockroaches. I've been there. I've done that, and it makes me thirsty. So how about a nice, cold beer? God damn! So Flake-- It's the next fuckin' shipment. Flake, there's no remorse, now that you know that she's pregnant? Now that you know that she had a child in her womb over there? Nothin'? You really have no remorse. I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to-- How am I supposed to-- You have no second thoughts. I have second thoughts. Let me tell you something: you have a kid, you have a wife that's pregnant-- Hold up. Hold up. No, no, no, hold up. You'll have second thoughts. You can't afford remorse, okay? You get remorse, you get weak. I'm not saying you didn't do a good job. You get weak, you die. As simple as that. He did his fuckin' job. What are you saying? You have a kid, you have a pregnant wife, you become more of a human being. If you have a kid, you're gonna be even more on your fuckin' plan then. Because you can't afford-- I'm not saying you're not on your plan. ...not to go home without diapers. What the hell is wrong with you? How do we know that her-- the fuckin'... Hey! How do we know if the bun in her fuckin' oven... Hey! At ease the shit, all right? Look, point in fact, he did his job. Rules of engagement states if they cross the trigger line, he kills 'em. That's fuckin' right! Hey! Get the fuck away from him! Sarge, how the fuck am I supposed to see in there? How? Have a fucking heart. Get in your fucking rack! Enough. Everybody go to bed, all right? Does anybody have a fucking problem with that? Enough. Shut the fucking camera off! All right, all right. Ten-hut! Okay, guys. You've all done a tremendous job, and I wanna personally thank each and every one of you. Colonel Ford, permission to speak, sir? Go ahead. Thank you. We just wanted to thank you for your kind words, and, also, there have been some rumors circulating about a possible follow-up mission. No, no, no. I haven't heard anything about that. But it does look like we have to keep up the work here just a little longer. Longer, sir? How much longer? As long as it takes, Private! That's what you're here for! Now buck the fuck up! Yes, sir! I just got orders. Second Battalion of 727 is pinned down in Baghdad. They can't replace us till someone replaces them. So half a company will have to temporarily remain here in Samarra to man the checkpoints and keep a lid on insurgent traffic. You know what it's like? I swear to God, it's like that Clerks movie. You know, where the guy has to work on his day off, and all kinds of crazy shit happens, and all he keeps thinking is, Oh, man, I'm not even supposed to be here today. None of us are supposed to be here. Fuck, man! We're just asking to get waxed. Dude, all I'm saying is, they just keep saying, "All right. You're going home tomorrow." And the next day, it's the same shit. You're going home tomorrow. Fuckin' on and on, week after week. "You're going home tomorrow." And we're still here, man. We're like sitting ducks. Take care of this, Sergeant. Fuckin' Sally, get that camera out of my face! What the fuck is your problem? What are you bitching about? What, because they extended our deployment? Big fuckin' surprise! Welcome to the goddamn Army! We all want to fuckin' go home! We can't. So stand the fuck up and be a fucking man about it! Drive on with a fuckin' hard-on! Yeah? Let's go! Coming here is one step closer to that appointment. What'd you say, Gabe? I said, every fucking day here is one step closer to that appointment. What? That book, the one that I read to you, the one that was so boring, you should check it out. "Death speaks. "There was a merchant in Baghdad "who sent his servant to market to buy provisions. "And in a little while, the servant came back "white and trembling, and said, "'Master, just now, when I was in the marketplace, "'I was jostled by women in the crowd, "'and when I turned, I saw it was Death that jostled me. "'She looked at me and made a threatening gesture. "'Now, lend me your horse, "'and I will ride away from the city and avoid my fate. "I will go to Samarra. There, Death will not find me.' "The merchant lent him his horse, and the servant mounted it, "and he dug his spurs in his flanks, "and as fast as the horse could gallop, he went. "Then the merchant went down to the marketplace, "and he saw me standing in the crowd, "and he came to me and said, "'Why did you make a threatening gesture to my servant "when you saw him this morning?' "'That was not a threatening gesture,' I said. "'It was only a startled surprise. "'I was astonished to see him in Baghdad, for I had an appointment with him tonight in Samarra.'" ? You awake? Wake up. Runnin' over there. White chocolate? No. Milk chocolate? Absolutely not. And dark chocolate. Dark chocolate. Those would be your three wishes if you found a magic lamp under one of these fuckin' rocks. And speaking of dark chocolate, Salazar. Hi. Oh, man. Oh, man. Ew! It's no good. Dude. Fuck that! Give me back my shit! Snowflake, goddamn it, man! That's my last one! Fuck! Jesus! Guys, guys, do not make a fucking move! Goddamn it! What the fuck is behind your eyes? My brain, Sergeant. You know what I think? Hey, Flake, get over here. Stand right here. Look alive, Soldier. Sal, are you getting all this? I'm getting all of it. Ask me what I think. What do you think, Master Sergeant? I can't help but think that Rush ain't gonna make it. Now, are you listening to me, Soldier? Yes, Sergeant. But are you hearing me? I'm hearing you, Sergeant. Goddamn it, boy. You're so dog ugly, a bullet to your face would be an improvement. Now listen up-- Fuck off, Sally. ...as I educate your boots on the ground. This ground, this very terrain that you are at present brainlessly bobbing your fat ass over-- Are you listening to me, Rush? Yes, Sergeant. But are you hearing me? I'm hearing you, Sergeant. Then slow the fuck down! Reconnoiter. Recon the area. Take a look around. Now answer me this: Did you or did you not check out this furniture here yesterday? No, Sergeant. Why not? Because it wasn't here yesterday. That's exactly my point. So stay the fuck away from it! Now, look, we came here in one piece, and you can bet your ass we're gonna leave here in one piece, all right? Roger that, Sergeant. Look alive, Soldier. Roger that, Sergeant. All right. Come on. Let's get our asses out of here. Goddamn it, Rush! Shut up! Fuck! Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck! And this shit hole is nothing but a fuckin' deathtrap. Oh! We need to get the fuck outta here. Yeah. Nuke it and pave it over, you know? Pave the whole fucking thing, man. Vaporize every last sand nigger. Goddamn right. Sweet's the only guy-- the only guy that ever gave a shit about us, and they torched him-- they fucking torched him! Hey, man, if they had fuckin' sent us home when they was supposed to, huh? Sweetness'd be alive, right? Partying with us right now. They're fucking killing us off one by one. That's why they took out the Twin Towers. Trying to fucking kill us. No. No, Sally. To get our attention. Attention for what? Jesus Christ, Sally. Don't you fuckin' get it? Man, they don't wanna kill us over there in the good old U.S. of A. I mean, shit, they do, but they can't. It's too fuckin' hard right now. Man, they wanna kill us here. On their turf, in their fuckin' shit hole country! Yeah. Where every turn is the wrong turn. Every single one of them knew where that fucking IED was! Goddamn right! You don't see them stepping on it? Do you? No! They just sit in their fucking backyard, drinking their fucking tea, waiting for one of us poor motherfuckers to light up their day. Come on, boys. Well, guess what. That ain't gonna happen no more! Hell, no! There's gonna be one big fuckin' bitch of a preemptive strike! Yeah! We're gonna be torching every last Johnny-fucking-jihad! Later. And there ain't gonna be nothing left but scorched fuckin' earth! Get down! Go, go, go, go! Inside, inside! Move! Down! We got one! We got one! Down! Clear! Down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! This is the guy! Let's go! Let's go! We're clear! Come on, people! Let's go! Come on! Check the back! Check the back! Clear! Move, move, move! What are you doing? Oh. Oh, hi. Uh, well, we're looking for evidence right now. Evidence of what? Evidence of anything that's gonna help us, uh, fight the war. Clear! Can read that? Well, no, of course not. Can have this paper? No, you can't have... This is Iraqi, okay? Iraqi? You mean Arabic? Arabic. That's right. This is really important stuff. So how do you know it's important? Well, we're gonna find out if it's important, 'cause I've got people who can translate this for me. And, um... But they're not here right now. So you guys have to step out. So how do you know it's evidence? We're gonna find out if it's evidence, all right? Jonesy, let's get these people out of here. Thank you for coming. Okay, people, let's go! Let's go! Move! Move it! Move it! Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Is this the guy? Yeah, this is him! Grab him! Bring him out! Get down! I won't shoot you! Up against the wall. Hands against the wall. I got him, I got him. He's clear. On your knees! Sit down. Give me the bag. Give me the bag. I'm bagging him. Well, he looks pretty harmless. Why are using a hood? Why are using a hood? Because once he's bagged, he's like a blind chicken. He can't run if he can't see. He can't breathe with that on. Are you sure he can breathe? No-- Yes, he can breathe. Can't you hear him breathing right now? Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure he can breathe. She says his back is broken. The old man's back is broken! Get off me! She said the old man's back is broken! Can you understand that? No-- All right. Well... I'm not carrying that bag of shit. Let's go! Everybody out! Let's go, let's go, let's go! 1, 2-- Let's go! Move, move, move! Move, move! Get back! Good boy. Uh, we're good. Right here. It's okay, it's okay. Right here. Arms up. Arms up. That's it. Arms-- Arms up. Arms up. Up. Arms. Arms. Arms! Mmm. Yella. Hoo! ? All the way from Camp Carolina, it's the first episode of Drug Poker, baby. I got an idea. Why don't you turn off the fucking camera? Do you guys know how big high-stakes poker is on TV? So what? When I sell my show and you guys become stars, you can all thank me then. How about that? Okay, yeah, we'll do that. Why don't you play the game right now? I'm playing. You can't afford us. There's no way. Sally? Come on, shithead. Are you in or out? All right, all right, all right. Don't fuck around. I...am... Wow. I'm out. You are so out. Out again. What do you know? I was out. Show me them. Show me them. I got two cards. And she's doing the Pledge of Allegiance, I think. What you got there, Reno? What's you say? "She's doing The Pledge of Allegiance!" Reno's doing-- doing all right. All right. Mr. Blix? Um, she's my favorite. I like her. Oh, that is a solid choice. She looks like a nice girl. Not bad for Mrs. Blix. Mr. Mactastic? Um, is it wrong to fall in love with the king of clubs? If you don't ask and you don't tell. There you go. All right, out of the cards. All right. What's happening right now? Blix, what do you need? Blix needs, uh... Blix needs three, although it's very hard to say good-bye to the 8 of clubs. Oh, yes, I'm sure it is. No, check her out. Freakie boy. One. Are the cards thirsty or something? I want four. Ooh. I'm thirsty. What? Did you just say you need four? Yeah. What's the big fucking deal? No, it's just-- it's perfect Rush strategy. Do you even have an ace, dude? I have an ace, and I boned her. We gotta go back to that house. What are you talking about? What house? That house we raided last week. I didn't see any orders about that. Dude, we're going to Farah's. Farah's house. That's right. What are you guys talking about? That's not... We just... There's nothing in that house. How can you say that that tasty skank is nothing? Come on, dude. We're gonna take some initiative and go to that house. She's a spoil of war. That's right. Oh, I forgot. That's exactly right. Okay, you guys are fucking crazy. Come on. They're drunk. Dude, we're all drunk. Turn that fucking thing off. No, keep that fucking thing on. Fuck off! This is off the record, so turn the fucking camera off! Back off. All right, all right. Keep it on! Fuck off! Guys, relax. Let's just play the game. You guys are really drunk, as I was saying before. So I actually think maybe... I'm seeing things clearer than you. No, you're not seeing anything clearer, Flake. Flake, you haven't seen anything clear in, like, four months. Stop it! Who doesn't see clear? How the fuck am I supposed to see clearly? I mean, what are we doing here? "What are we doing here?" Yeah, what the fuck are we doing here? You know what we're doing here. We're helping the new Iraqi government survive. Knuckleheads. And what the fuck do you think is so important about that? I think there's a lot important about that. Enlighten me. We're, you know-- We're-- What? We're just doing our job. We're not-- We're not supposed to think about it. We're supposed to follow orders. We're soldiers. Amen. Yeah. Welcome to the fucking Army. But these people don't want us here. Yes, they do. No, they don't. They want us dead and gone. And when those fucking beltway clerks finally find that out, we're gonna be both. So, in the meantime, Rush and me and...Gabriel... I have to say shut the fuck up. Get away from me, because I'm not doing... You're such a pussy! I'm not a pussy because I don't wanna break through the door... Oh, no, the door's already broken down. The door's already broken down. The father's locked up. What's the problem? Nothing to worry about. Let's do it. Sounds like the perfect cap on the evening. I agree. Yeah, perfect cap on the evening. I'm gonna go wake up Sarge. I'm gonna ask him what the SOP is on a gang rape. You're not gonna say shit! Don't wake up Sarge for this. I'm not gonna say shit? No, you're not gonna say shit. You know why Sarge is finding out shit? Why? Because nothing's gonna happen, because you guys couldn't even get outside the wire if you wanted to. Get your fucking hands off me! Hey! Hey! Cut it out. Cut it out. That's bullshit! Sit down, sit down. If you can find your chair. Got it. All right. Can we play the fucking game? Jesus Christ, Gabe! What do you think, Sally? I-- I think I'm gonna be going for this little-- this little jaunt. Yeah, you are, baby! Sally's got a set of balls. What about you, McCoy? Are you serious? Come on, dude. Come with. Get your fucking hand off me. No, fuck him. Pussy boy doesn't want to go. Dude, let me tell you something. First of all, y'all are drunk. Thank you. Probably high doing all sorts of fucking drugs or whatever the hell you're doing. You're fucked-up. But? If I go, it's to make sure you don't get your asses killed. That's right. When we go. We are not gonna get killed! "Hello, honey. "I don't have much time, but I have to send you this. "First, I want you to know that I love you very much. "I miss you more every day "and can't wait to touch your beautiful face. "I was looking at the pictures "you just sent me of you and the boys. "I'm wishing to God I was there instead of here. "The guys have been drinking all day, "and it looks like they're going out looking for trouble. "I can't stop them, "but I'm going to make sure "they don't get themselves hurt. "You just can't go outside and blow off steam here. "It's too dangerous. "Anyway, I love you. Lawyer." I knew he was doing raids outside the wire, but he hadn't done too many in a while, and I-I'd built up a sense of security in knowing this. I live for his phone calls and his chats online, you know? They help me not to worry so much. But today is-- ...is different. Oh, my-- Um, I'm scared. I'm-- I'm scared to death for him. I rigged a mini-cam to my helmet so I can record tonight's follies without the guys knowing about it. I don't want 'em getting camera-shy. So what are you gonna do? I don't know, man. I'm gonna-- ...go with them and try to talk some sense into them. Dude, they're going to get about 20 feet outside there, they'll get scared of the dark, and come right back here. And what about Sally? Sa-- Man, you know, Sally-- What's he doing? He's gonna go out there, come running back to base camp, turn on his camcorder and give a firsthand account of what he saw. It's sick. It's fuckin' sick. It's a pretty juicy story, though, isn't it? "Our band of brothers losing their moral compass and trying to wreak vengeance on a 15-year-old girl. It's unbelievable. Yeah. Ride the cable news chain all the way up to 60 fucking Minutes. Hey. Hey, Rush. What's up, man? What the fuck are you two doing? Just talking, you know. Smoking. Oh. Thought you quit. Uh, no. No, I-- I never quit. Oh, shit! Temper, temper! Hot damn. The fuckin' pussy's on the rag again. Jesus Christ! Hey, man. Where's your gear? Rush, dude. Come on. Let's think about this.

Just shut up! You listen to me like you never listened before in your life. If I hear you breathing one word about anything that goes on here tonight, so help me God, I will cut your fucking tongue out. And I'll feed it to that fucking dog of yours. You get me? Do you get me, Blix? Yeah. Good boy. Now why don't you get the fuck out of here? Go read some Shakespeare. I'm talking about the girl, man. The girl? I'm talking about fucking with a 15-year-old girl. What the fuck is wrong with you? You're all discombobulated. You got to lay off that hajji juice, 'cause that is some sneaky shit. I don't touch that fucking shit, you know that. Really? What the fuck are you doing up here? You're supposed to be at the rear. Excuse me? You giving me an order, Private Flake? That's right, Corporal. Get to the fuckin' rear! Fuck off me! Fuck you! Fuck off, bitch. McCoy! McCoy, you're not going to go in? Fuck it! McCoy, come on! What's your excuse, Sally? Huh? Excuse for what? Excuse for wanting to take a part of this, huh? McCoy, I'm a fly on the wall. I got to get a record of what's happening. That's right, you're the fly on the fuckin' wall. Yes! Actually, Sally, I think you're a fuckin' jackal! Ripping meat off a fucking carcass! That's what you are. Can I quote you on that one? Sure, Sally, quote away. You know what? I got another quote for you. You ready? What? What? Take a look around you at all your greedy, media buddies-- You dick. ...who sold their soul for a talk show and a book deal! 'Cause that's what you are! This is my free pass into film school, right now. Really? Well done, Sally. Take it all down, cry for cry, and scream for scream-- go ahead! Thanks for your permission, there, dick. Oh, look out there, Mac. I don't want you tripping over your goddamn soapbox. Fuck it. Fuck you! Flake! Flake. Flake, enough's enough, man. Enough's enough. You've had your fun. Let's get out of here. We're just gettin' started. We just got here. What the fuck's your problem, McCoy? You shouldn't be here, Flake, and you know it. We're just here, man. We're here, and we are gonna fuckin' find these-- weapons-- we're searching for evidence-- We're looking for weapons of mass destruction! Weapons of mass destruction. That's right. I don't give a shit what anybody says. They're here, and we're going to find them. Flake, there is nothing here, and you know it! What are you fucking-- We ripped this place apart last week. There's nothing here! They're just like weeds, McCoy. You rip 'em up, they're all back the next day, aren't they? She's a 15-year-old girl, man. She's a 15-year-old girl. We're going to accomplish this mission. Please don't do this. We are going to conquer that. It's inhuman to rape. She's a fine cunt, just like everybody else in this fucking country. I'm not doin' it, man. You fuckin' candy ass! Well, you're not doin' it! Shut the fuck up. Are you not supporting the troops? What? Are you not supporting the troops? No. Oops. Did I just blow your fuckin' head off? Don't. Where are your balls, McCoy? Man, I thought you had a pair. What are they, at home? Inside your wife's sandy hajj pussy? God! Fuck you! Thought you had a pair. How about you, Rush? Where are your balls? They're almost in her ass, sir. Almost in her ass. What about you, Sally? Get it up! "I can't hear you, sir." They're right here. I can't hear you. I can't hear you! They're right here! Where are your balls? They're right here! Good! All right. All right, motherfucker. Hitch a ride outside. Take the faggot watch. Yeah, take the faggot watch, you pussy! Bunch of fuckin' assholes. Fuck you. What do you think of that, huh? Ooh, did you like that? Did you miss me, huh? Oh, it's go time for you. You ready? Huh? Whoa, whoa, whoa! So, you ready? Here you go, here you go. Come here, Salazar. Come here. Take her fucking hand. Take her fucking hand! Rush. Rush. Rush, hold on! Wait. Wait for Flake. Hold on, Rush. Wait for Flake. This is his idea. He gets the cherry. Come on, wait up. What? You got a problem with sloppy seconds? Holy shit! He tried to use this on me. Motherfuck. Those motherfuckers! What the fuck do you think I did? I fuckin' killed them all. I killed them all. Every fuckin' one of them. They're fuckin' all gone, baby. They're all fuckin' gone. All right. Sally, come on over here, baby. It's showtime. Take the fuckin' hand. Here we go. Oh. You ready? You ready for the ride of your life, bitch? Shut the fuck up! Don't you fuckin' make a sound! Give it to her! Aah! God! What happened? What happened in there? Talk to me! Tell them-- No! Fuck! What are you talking about? McCoy! What's up, Rush? What are you doing? What am I doing? What are you telling Blix? Nothing. Just shooting the breeze, man. Just shooting the breeze, huh? Get the fuck off him, Rush. Back off! Back off, Blix! I'll cut you like a pig! Sit down. Okay, okay. Get the fuck off me! If you fuckin' move, I'll snap it. It'll be real quick. Piece of shit. I want you to listen to me real careful, Mac. Listen to what? Have you ever been to Vegas? What? Are you fucking deaf, McCoy? Am I speaking too softly for you? No, I hear you. All right. So you're tuned in on my frequency, right? Yes. Good. Now let me ask you again. Have you ever been to Vegas? Yes, I've been to fucking Vegas. Good. Now what do they say? Uh-- What do they say about what happens there? It stays there. I'm sorry. What was that? It stays there. "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas." That's right. That's right, Big Mac. Now I want you to think about our little trip tonight, like it was a trip to Vegas. Okay. You read me, soldier? Yes, I read you. Do you fuckin' read me? Yes, I hear you! Sometimes, man-- I swear to God. For a college boy, you can be real fucking stupid. Where's Flake, Rush? What the fuck do you care, hairball? Huh? For your information, our boy Flake is inside right now. Sleeping like a little baby. You know what that's like, right, Blix? Right after you've been sucked and fucked? Hey, Mac, man. Where were you? What do you mean, where was I? I mean, what the fuck happened to you? I went outside. I was on watch. Flake stuck a gun in my face. You remember that? That's right, that's right. You were on watch. Did you see anything? Ah. No, I didn't see anything. Well, that's good. That's good, because you were on watch, right? Yeah, I was on watch, so-- I mean, it was kind of dark out there, too. Yeah, it was pitch dark, actually. Yeah. What about the fire? Did you see the fire? Fire? It was a big fuckin' fire. You didn't see that? No, I didn't see it. I had my back to the house, just looking around, so I guess I must have missed the fire. That's good. That's good, man. And what about the insurgents? Insurgents? Yeah, man. We had to hightail it out of there. They were like, all over the place. And really pissed. Mm. That must have been one of those Sunni-Shiite things. Right. You know, I mean-- We don't want to get caught in a civil war crossfire. So the, uh, insurgents set the fire. Yeah, it must have been. Because you know, when they're not trying to kill us, Yeah, they're torchi'' each other. And when did you start having these dreams? A couple nights. I couldn't sleep. I don't want to sleep. Can you remember anything? Anything that happened that could have triggered them? Yeah, after Sweet died? And I was shooting it when it happened. He got blown apart. I got it all on tape. His arm landed right in front of me. Have you looked at the video? Couple of times, but then I stop, but it kept going, going over and over again in my head. That's when I began hating everyone. Every hajji out there. I couldn't stand the sight of them, and I got angry all the time. And then I couldn't sleep, and every time I did, I'd have the same dream of her body burning. Her body? No. No. No, his body. Sweet's body. It gets mixed up in my head. And you videoed it. Yeah. It's part of my diary of my experiences here. I'm going to use it to get into film school. Is this part of your experience? What, talking to you? Yeah. Talking to me. I can't do it anymore. Everything you shouldn't see, just because you're watching it doesn't mean you're not a part of it. That's what everyone does, you know? They just watch, and they do nothing. Or they make a video for people to watch, and they do nothing! Got to tell someone. It's driving me crazy. Dad, if something happened, something really, really horrible, and you knew who was responsible, isn't it your duty to say something? What did you do? I didn't do anything. I didn't do a damn thing. A couple of my buddies-- Members of your squad? Yes, sir. I hope you realize how serious this situation could be. Yes, I do realize. We don't need another Abu Ghraib. I understand that, sir, but-- I mean, if your brothers screwed up, that behavior reflects on the whole Corps. There was a crime, sir. I think charges should be brought. Son, listen to me. Do you know the first thing to come into question in a court martial in a thing like this will be your sanity. My sanity? That's right! Your sanity, for bringing charges like this. I don't care. I don't care. Here I am, Mama, in beautiful, downtown Samarra, getting you a homecoming present. I've been shooting some unbelievable stuff. I can't show it to anybody, because I'd get in a lot of trouble here. But when I get back, everyone's going to see this. The truth about what's going down here. 24 times a second, 24/7-- Get off! Rush! Rush! Fuck. Sally, where the fuck did you go? Mount up! The body being loaded into this military ambulance is believed to be that of the U.S. soldier missing since last Friday. That's according to Iraq Defense Ministry Secretary, Abdul Aziz. This Bedouin encampment where the body was discovered just moments ago is outside the Samarra base camp where the soldier was kidnapped. The Pentagon has not yet issued a statement on the identity of the body, but senior sources tell us it could be the body of Angel Salazar, who went missing last Friday. Iraqi Defense Ministry spokesmen have said the details are very disturbing. There are signs of torture and decapitation. Allahu Akbhar! Allahu Akbhar! Allahu Akbhar! Private Flake, what kind of a soldier was your fallen friend, Angel Salazar? And take your time. What the fuck? What do you think I was doing? I was taking my time. Jesus Christ, Snowflake. Don't get a fuckin' hard-on, man, all right? I'm trying to make this official and everything. All right? All right. Uh, Private, how-how would you summarize your buddy? I mean, you know, if you take all of his...his parts, and you like stack them, one on top of one another, right, what would-- What would-- What would be the one word that would-- ...be the sum of those parts? Generous? Generous. He was a generous spic. That's a very good word. And how was he generous? He was a... dedicated reporter. He used that camera. This camera right here? To record his-- our-- war stories. Stories that will last on into history. Long after you and me are gone. He was like our very own Private...Ryan. Hey-up! Semper fi, brother. Semper fuckin' fi, fuck Marines. Okay. What would be, Private, your last memory of our brother Salazar? I-- ...just can't talk about it. I understand. This is hard. But I can talk about my brother. And the life lessons that he taught me. Well, lay it on me. My brother, Vegas Flake. Really, you have a brother named Vegas? Yep. I have a brother named Vegas. Reno and Vegas. Daddy was a gambler, and he named his two favorite sons after his two favorite places. Hmm. Called us his wild cards. That's nice. Yeah, I thought so. I do, too. Vegas was a Teamster. Mm-hmm. And the head of his local, Mike Dancer, he's a troublemaker. He'd run for president of the U.T., and lost, now the bitter prick Dancer's contesting the election. Got ahold of some ballot boxes that my brother Vegas had rigged, and he's blowing his whistle to federal prosecutors. Nothing but a fucking rat. Word comes down. He's got to go. So, what happened? A fucking embarrassment. A bunch of clowns who need a road map to find their own assholes drive out to his house one night. Knock on the door. And are they, like, locked and loaded? Yeah! Yeah, they are locked and loaded. So? So. Dancer opens the door. He's there, big as life in his shorts and T-shirt, holding his fucking newspaper? And what do you think our Wild Bunch did? They just blasted the shit out of him, right? Wrong. They asked him for a job. A job. Yeah, that's right. A job. They're too chickenshit to shoot him. He's the head of a local. Since they're not getting paid for not killing him-- and what the fuck are they doing on his doorstep anyway-- they ask him for a job. They really asked him for a job? Yeah, he says to 'em, too. He's like, "Come by the office in the morning. I'll see what I can do for you." They get in the car, drive to the nearest bar. Fucking embarrassment. Right, I don't get it. Listen on, my man. Clyde, the mastermind of this group, sees my brother-- Vegas. ...playing pool. Invites him in the back room, says Dancer's going down. Vegas has got his own beef with Dancer, right? Contract for 20,000? My brother says he'll do it for ten. What about the other guys, says Clyde. What about the other guys, says my brother. I-I-- I still don't get it, though. They drive back out to Dancer's. Opens the door. Oh, shit. Shorts, T-shirt. Vegas shoots him in the face. Steps over the body, goes upstairs, kills the wife and kids, in and out, five minutes. End of story. Wow. Um-- All right. So, uh, All right. Great story. All right. Private, what would you say would be the lesson that we have learned here today? Uh, the lesson is that, when you're on a mission, a deadly mission-- Deadly mission. It's all about having the right mix of guys. And in that mix, there's got to be the wild card. Vegas was the wild card. And so am I. Mm-hmm. You got that right. And what has become of the wild card, Vegas? He's dead. He died in prison. Jesus. He got caught? Took about, what, 24 hours. Cops come knocking on Clyde's door, they flip him, go to the bar, find Vegas-- Only takes one fucking rat to bring the whole house down. Jesus, dude. What are you looking at me for? I'm sorry. You know, my mom always told me it was impolite to stare. Come on, dude. I mean, what about the other guys? What about the other guys? Well, McCoy didn't see nothing. And Angel-- Well, kind of lost his head. I am making this video to expose a situation that happened to my squad that I think people should know about. I'm hiding my identity from the public because I'm afraid that the F.B.I., and the Department of Defense, and even the Insurgents can trace my I.D. and find me. They already got one of my guys, and I'm not going to take any chances. But this needs to be said. For legal reasons, and for my personal safety, I cannot reveal the time or the place or the soldiers involved, but believe me, everything I'm about to tell you, everything is absolutely true. When I was stationed in the Middle East, two men from my squad raped and killed a 15-year-old girl, killed her little sister, killed her mother, and killed her grandfather and no one has done a thing about it. I'm posting this on the Internet in hopes that someone from my squad, anyone, will see it, and will help me, please, bring this forward, and bring this out into the light. Did you see the woman being raped? Yeir. Well, uh, not really. Rush was holding her down when I went outside. Well, to do what? To get away. I didn't think they were actually going to do it. How did you know her? Flake put a gun in my face and told me to go on watch. How did you know her? She would go in and out of our checkpoint every day. Rush would take a little extra time with her. Said he was just being thorough. And why did you make this assumption that she was a girl and not a woman? Because she was younger than that. She didn't look that old, so I just assumed that she-- Wasn't she an insurgent, resisting arrest? Uh, no. No. She was just a girl. She was scared to death. How do you know she wasn't scared to death because she was an insurgent resisting arrest? Because, um, Flake said that we were going to get this girl and "have a little fun." Oh, that's new. When did he say that? He said it when we were playing poker one night. I thought he was just kidding around. Did you see Flake rape her? No, I told you. I went outside. So what did you see? I didn't see him ra-- I heard some shots. I heard some screams. Then what happened? Then I went up the stairs, and I saw Salazar, and he told me what happened inside. You didn't actually see him shoot her. No, but Flake had a gun pointed at her head-- So did Salazar and Rush have guns? Yes, sir. Rush had a gun. Did you have a gun? Yes, sir, I did. Couldn't Rush have shot her? No! I-- Couldn't you have shot her? I didn't shoot the girl. But when you saw her, she was still alive. I told you. I didn't go back inside. Salazar said-- We're not interested in what Salazar said. We're interested in what you saw. Flake shot her in the face! So you believed she was dead. Yes! I believed she was dead. But you didn't see him shoot her. No, but I didn't know-- And you didn't see him rape her. No, but that's not the point! What is the point? Isn't your testimony that you were outside keeping watch? I didn't know what to do. I didn't want to see it, and I didn't want to be a part of it. Why don't you believe me? This is the scene of one of the most shocking crimes alleged to have been carried out by American soldiers in Iraq. According to evidence at the hearing, one July evening, four U.S. soldiers came to this house here. According to Lawyer McCoy's statement, Reno Flake and B.B. Rush repeatedly raped a 15-year-old girl. In another room, the girl's grandfather, mother, and little sister were shot dead. This man, Private Reno Flake, is accused of committing all the murders. His accomplice, B.B. Rush, was taken-- We were securing the area. We checked everyone and everything. And that girl went in and out of our checkpoint again and again. So, yeah, I checked her thoroughly. Every fucking time, because there was something fishy about her. "Fishy"? What exactly do you mean by fishy, Specialist Rush? Fishy, fishy, like she was up to something. And I'll deal you one more card. It's angel faces like hers that are going to walk right up to you and give you a great big smile, and then blow you the fuck apart. And sure as shit, the next day, the very next fucking day, one of my best buddies got torched on a path that she just walked right over. Didn't miss a beat. So don't you dare sit there for one second and think that she didn't know where that fuckin' IED was planted. You know, I went back to the house because I knew they were hiding weapons and shit? I mean, hell, that old man, broken back, tried to shoot me with an AK-47. You know-- Hey-- It really pisses me off, sir, when I think of everything we've done for these sand niggers? Got rid of Saddam, planted democracy, giving up our lives to keep them safe from their own insurgents, and I'm not looking for a thank-you, but-- I want them to stop trying to kill us! Mm-hmm. Did you find these weapons before or after you raped the girl? Raped? I mean-- That hajji bitch was all over me. What, bombing and shooting them is okay, but fucking them isn't. I mean, who-- who says-- Do you say? Who says their pussies aren't better than their hearts and minds? Would you answer the question, Pratt? This is bullshit. Just a, you know-- It's a dog and pony show for the folks back home, right? I'm just one of those bad apples, huh? Soldiers like B.B. Rush and I? We're keeping the Arab scum off your doorstep. We shouldn't be in here answering this crap. Let me tell you something, sir. We should be out, doing our job, boots on the ground, finding the bad guys, putting two in the heart and one in the head, keeping America safe and making sure the motherfucker's dead. You prosecute guys like us. You're just aiding the terrorists. A quick death... is too good for this brainwashed, racist Nazi fuck. This stormtrooper needs to be stripped naked and strung up by his feet. Then, what's left of the family-- you know, the ones he didn't shoot or set on fire-- the family of that poor little girl should be given baseball bats, white-hot branding irons, blow torches, dull knives, pliers, and, of course, rocks, and be told to go to town! This is the same monster immortalized in every fucking movie about Vietnam. "Let's do the whole fucking village!" You don't see the My Lai massacre in the movies because the truths of that fascist orgy are just too hellish for even liberal Hollywood to cop to. Oh, but that doesn't stop them making another movie about 9/11 because an American life is worth so much more than a Vietnamese, a Palestinian, a Lebanese, or an Iraqi life because we are the uber race. Sieg heil, motherfucker! Oh. Okay. Okay, that's great. All right. All right, now-- Hey, McCoy-- Woman! ...I'm not getting your faces. Come on, I want you to turn toward me. Come on, come on. Look in the lens here. All right, all right, all right. Hurry up. Take your picture. ALl right, here we go. Ready? Come on. Face me. Here we go. Here we go. Come on, Judy, look at me. Here we go. 1, 2-- No, I got to go fix my face. Your-- What? Your face is fine. It's just-- I'll fix my lipstick. It's perfectly fine. You look great! Judy! Okay. How about a war story? Yeah, how about not? Oh, yeah. Come on. There are no war stories. Tell us a war story. You don't want to hear a war story. Sure we do. Tell us what you did out there. Did you kill anybody? Come on! Let's hear one. Do you want to hear a war story? Absolutely. Do you really want to hear a war story? Very much so. Absolutely. All right. Here's a war story for you. Uh... when I first went over there, to Afghanistan, I was, uh, I was all amped up to kill for my country. I was ready to just kick some ass, you know? Get some licks in for what they did to the Towers. Just be a big fucking war hero. Right on! Yeah! I get over to Iraq, and man, it's just-- it's just a totally different story. You grow up really, really fast over there because everything you see, everywhere you look is just death, and it's suffering. And the killing that I did do, it made me sick to my stomach because of these smells and these sounds and these images. I have these-- these snapshots in my brain that are burned in there forever, and I don't know what the fuck I'm going to do about them. And what was I doing there? What was I doing in a country that's done nothing to me? Just following orders? Bullshit. Bull shit. You better have a really good fucking reason for one of your buddies to die in your arms, to be blown up right in front of you. A really good fucking reason. And I saw some shit there, man. I just-- I just don't know how I'm going to live with. I went on a raid in Samarra. And two men from my unit raped and killed a 15-year-old girl and burned her body. And I didn't do anything to stop it. Oh, no. No, no. This is a celebration for a war hero. Come on, come on. Celebration! To Lawyer McCoy! Come on, come on. And I'm going to get my picture here. Okay. Okay. Okay, McCoy. Here we go. Look at the camera. Come on, Judy. Look at us here. Here we go. 1, 2, 3-- Subtitles extracted by LeapinLar
