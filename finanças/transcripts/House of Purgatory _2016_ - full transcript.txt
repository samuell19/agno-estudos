- Oh, disgusting. - Pumpkin guts, I love the way they feel. I wanna fill up an entire bathtub full of pumpkin guts and roll around in it. - That's nasty. - That'd be awesome. - You guys are saving the seeds, right? - Yeah. You know how to cook them? - Yeah, you put them in the oven. - Don't you have to season them or something? - With what? - I don't know, brown sugar? - Just salt, like, uh, with sunflower seeds. - That makes sense. So Mel, all your mom's got is three types of vodka, is this one cool? - Whatever. - Your mom doesn't care that we drink her booze? - Just fill it back up with water. She doesn't drink that crap. It's been here since my dad left. - Where's Amber tonight? - Please, you think the warden's gonna let her out of the house on a school night? Probably forcing her to take communion as we speak. Speaking of which. Oh! - What the Hell? Megan! - It's vodka-flavored water. - Oh, looks like I already got to that bottle. - Ugh. - Grab another one. Hell, if my mom doesn't know that one has water in them, she certainly won't notice both of 'em. - Who's calling? - Nate. - I didn't know you talked to Nate. - Yeah, we've been talking a lot lately. - You gonna answer it? - I'll call him back. - I love Nate, nice guy. - Who do you love? - Nate Summers What? How can you not like Nate? Everybody loves Nate. - He's the nicest guy in the world. - He's kind of a girl. I don't know, he's just so. - What the Hell is that? - He's a pussy, totally gay. - He is not. - Definitely got some gay tendencies. - Like what? - Like, like being all nice. - He's gay because he's nice? - Straight guys are never nice. - The idiots that you date are not nice. Normal guys are nice. - If by normal you mean gay, then I completely agree. If a guy likes you, he's not gonna be nice. - I think you're still in the third grade. - So if he pulls my pigtails he likes me? - Oh my God, that's why Tyler was chaing me around the playground trying to put gum in my hair? Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! - Laugh it up, bitches - I think it's still in there. - Don't cry to me when you're dating Nate and you catch him playing explore my body with Coach Van Lanning. - Eww. - Well, anyway, cheers, bitches. Uh, now that's good stuff. Ignoring you. - Are you done yet? - Just about. - Your thing better look like the Mona Lisa, or something, because you are the slowest cunkin parver. Cunkin parver? - Pumpkin carver. - Anyway, cunkin parver, I am done. Finally. - Got candles? - Thank you. So cool. My lid, please. - Lid - Thank you. - Ooh. - You guys ready? - Yes. - One, two, three. - I'm an artiste. I'm gonna go to a school for cunkin parving. - You shut your big asshole. Perfect timing. - No kidding, talk about dramatic effects. - Oh shit, my mom's home. - Oh, my God. - Feel free to help. - What, I am, I'm making sure the pumpkins look perfect. So, uh, your mom's impressed. - Great, cause that helps. - What's your mom doing out there? - What do you mean? - From the front window it looks like she's sleeping in the car. - What? - That is her car, right? Yeah, that's her. What the Hell is she doing? Is she on her phone? - My mom doesn't have a cell phone. - I mean, it looks like she's asleep or something, right? Maybe she's drunk. - Yeah, my mom the lush. I'm gonna go out there. - All right, me too. - Me, too. - Mom! - Mrs. Peterson, your greeting service has arrived. - 'Ello Madam. - Will you stop it, what did you drink? - Mom, mom. Mom? - Oh my God. - Oh my God, let's get in the house. - Open the door, open the door. Open the door, open the door. - Boo. - That was fucked up. - Language. It was Mom's idea. - Are you freakin' serious? - Trick or treat. - I can't believe your Mom. - Yeah, she really went all out this year, that's for sure. - That's awesome. - Yo. - Hey. - 'Sup. - Hey. - So, uh, heard this one peed her pants last night. - I did not. - I heard it wasn't just pee. - Shut up. - So what are you guys doing after the football game? - Is Trish still throwing her Halloween party? - Oh crap, I totally forgot about that. Do you have a costume? - Yep, what about you guys. - Clark Kent. - Who's Clark Kent? - You don't know who Clark Kent is? - Hence my asking. - Oh, just say Superman. - I'm not goin' as Superman, I'm goin' as Clark Kent. Huge difference. - Superman? That's original. - Clark Kent, he's Superman's alter ego it's-- - So what about you guys? - I got a sick pirate costume. - Johnny Depp pirate or Somalian gunboat pirate? - Now I'm rethinking it. - What about you, Ryan? - Oh you know, drunk version of myself. - Shocking. - Always too cool, aren't you. - You know it. - Speak of the devil. - Ryan here is too cool to wear a costume to your party tonight. - Costumes are gay. - It's Halloween, and it's a costume party. - Yep, sounds pretty gay. - OK, well, so you're not gonna wear a costume and everybody else is? You're gonna be that guy? - Oh, don't be that guy. - You'll look like the idiot. - Not compared to Superman over here. - All right guys, well, if I don't see you after the game, good luck. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Oh watch it. - Oh, yeah! - Dude, there's no way. - Just htink about it. - What are you idiots arguing over? - Well, I was just saying that a slutty Dorothy is way hotter than a slutty pirate. - No way. It's a slutty pirate, how hot is that? - I think it's hot. - Oh my God. - It's hot, but it's not as hot as slutty Dorothy. I mean, a pirate can be slutty, no problem. Dorothy's not supposed to be slutty. The fact that she is slutty. Now that makes her even more slutty. - Wow, just, wow. - Holy shit. Oh that ain't right. - Why is it that they have to dress so slutty anyways? I mean is there some kind of rule or something that says girls have to dress as whores? They can't just be Dorothy, they've gotta be slutty Dorothy. Can't just be a pirate, they've got to be a slutty pirate. - And you're complaining? - Fuck no, just wondering. - To Halloween, the most spectacular, wonderful holiday, created by God himself. - Hey, I mean, if we want, I'm sure we can get Justin to be slutty Superman. - Clark Kent, ass. - Urban legend, it does not exist. That same stupid story's been floating around forever and pops up every couple of years. People swear it's in Ohio, Detroit, Dallas, Michigan. - I heard it's about a half-hour north of here. - Yeah, my cousin has been there. - Retarded, both of you. - Why are they retarded now? - Have you heard of the haunted house that you get money back for every floor that you make it up? - And it's so scary that nobody's ever made it all the way through. - Yeah, I've heard of that. - It doesn't exist. - Didn't some college kids go looking for it a couple of years ago and they were never seen again? - I remember hearing that people from Madison went missing on Halloween. But I didn't hear that they went to the haunted house. - Perfect, why don't we go find this place tonight. Right now. - Whatever. - Seriously, if you're so sure this place doesn't exist, come prove it. - You're not driving. - No, but Nate will, right buddy? - How'd I get pulled into this? - Come on. - You haven't been drinking? - Meh. - Why not? - I don't know, I didn't feel like it. - I'll go with you, just so that I can laugh at you the whole way back after you realize you're wrong. - Bring it, Nate let's go, Trish, you coming? - As much as I'd love to be there when you get proved wrong, I can't leave the party. - You know what, whatever, I'm gonna call you when we find it. - If you find it, call me, and I'll come out there. - I thought you couldn't leave your party. - I can't, that's how sure I am you won't find it. - Whatever. - Megs? - No, I'm going to some musical zombie thing with Jeremy. - Jeremy Shaver? Gross. - Whatever, he's get weed. - Nice. - Hey guys, what's up? - Road trip. - And you're coming. - What, where? - I'll explain on the way. - I have to be home by 1:00. - It's like 10:30, you'll be fine, and if you're a little late, oh well. - There's no such thing as oh well in my family. - These d-bags say it's not far. If we don't find it, when we don't find it, we'll come right back, I promise you won't be late. Don't make me go alone with them, please. - You're not worried about curfew? - I've never really had one of those things. I hear it's kind of a bitch, though. Let's go change. - Where are we going. - Later, losers. - I really can't be late. Come on, it's Halloween. - It's crazy. - It's stupid. - Did someone skit over him? What's like, his deal? I've never heard of it. - OK, that's because it doesn't exist, people. - Bullshit, you'll see. And I'll be the first one to make it all the way through. - Yeah, I'm sure you're the first person to say that. Do you have any idea where I'm goin'? - It's on some farm or some shit somewhere. - Dude. - Dude, what? - You're not drinking in my car. - Calm down, it'll be fine, I'll be cool. - Why is it you only drink in my car and nobody else's? - Cause you're the only one who allows it. - No, I don't. - Yeah. Have any good music in here? Other than your mom's radio stations? - Don't touch my radio. And you really have no idea? - I heard Casco. - Those two bars we just passed? That was Casco. - Maybe it's on County A. - Where's that? - Isn't that the one that's just before the river? - I think that was like County K or something. - Then maybe it's on County K or something. - You don't know. - Shut up. - This is stupid, we're turning around. - Just go a little further up. - No, I'm gonna turn it around. - Come on, just go up one more road after this one. - You lose. - Uh, you suck. - What is that? - Holy shit. - House of Purgatory. - I told you. - It's a haunted house but it doesn't mean it's the one where you get your money back. - It has to be, pull in. - I mean, is it open? Where are all the cars? - The sign is lit, it's gotta be open. - Ooh, it's creepy. - Oh this is gonna be awesome. - Oh, calm down. - How creepy. Are we seriously the only ones here? - We can't be. - You think nobody knows where this place is, or what? - No, there's gotta be other people around. - Doesn't seem like it. - Come on. - Be quick. - Sir? Sir? Uh, we were wondering if you're still open. - Always. - Nice. And this is the haunted house where you get money back for making it all the way through? - Yeah. - Awesome, told you guys it was real. Who's the man. Not you. - Go on, say it. - Shut up. - The, uh, admission price is kind of faded. How much does it cost? - It's Halloween, there's no fee on Halloween. - Seriously? Friggin' sweet. - So how does it normally work, you get your money back if you make it all the way up? - No. - So? - You gotta make it all the way down. - What? - Start at the top, make your way to the bottom. - And nobody's ever made it all the way through? - Nobody escapes purgatory. - Awesome. All right, well, let's do this. Bwahahaha. Shut up. - This is badass. - Mel, d'ya call Trish? - You really want me to call her? - Yeah, get her ass out here. - Where is this place again? - County K, just off Main. This is where those chainsaw dudes usually pop out. - Stop it, I hate those guys. - I do, too. - Holy shit. - That is amazing. - It's small. - Nate hears that a lot. - I thought you started on the fifth floor. - It must be some basement. Come on. - Where is everybody? - Inside facing their darkest fears. - I can't believe there's no line on Halloween night, I mean there's always crazy lines at these things. It's cause everybody's dumb like you and doesn't think this place exists. - You're dumb. - You're dumb. - Hey, did you bring any beer. - Yeah, but none for you. - Yeah. - Secrets, secrets are so fun, Your secrets here will come undone. Creepy. - Cheesy. - Awesome. - You're awfully quiet. - What? Oh yeah. - You're not scared are you? - A little bit. Bwah! Oh! - Nothing is hidden inside this place. Abandon all hope for it cannot penetrate these walls. - Well let's go. I can't see anything Which way do we go? Wait for your eyes to adjust. Ryan, where are you? Right here, just reach out. That's me. Here, you two go in front of me, I'll bring up the rear. Hah, you would. Is that you? Here, put your hand right here. Oh, you're gross. Ow, whatever, you liked it. Wait, it's a door. - Don't leave me, Mel. - What is it? What is it? - It's, uh, it's... - A weird picture of a carnival? - No, I, wait a minute. That's not what it was of, I swear. Whoa, um, vandalism is probably frowned upon. - I, uh... - What did you think it was of? Um nothing, nothing. - Well, that will happen in the House of Purgatory, bwahahahaha. All right, well. Yes. - Come on, sweetie. - That was the first floor? God this place sucks. No wonder they didn't charge us any money. So easy. What? You really thought it was that bad? What's your deal? - What? Did you see something behind us? - I did, did you see the pool of piss where Ryan pissed his pants. - Come on. - Pussy. - Bet somethin's about to jump out at us. One, two, three! Ahh - Oh shit. Oh my God, that is the nastiest thing I've ever smelled. Jesus, oh. - Oh, it stinks. - Looks real. - Don't touch it. Aw, it's slimy. Let's go, let's go. Think she's real? God, I hope not. - She sure is hot. You're sick, don't. - Oh come on, you guys are no fun. Let's go. God, they should put cameras up in here to see how dumb we look. - Help! Get me out of here! Get me out, get me out of here! Please, get me the fuck out of here! - Whoa, that was intense. - That scared the shit out of me. Me, too, that was awesome. - No it wasn't, I don't think I want to do this anymore. - What? It's not like they're actually killing anybody or anything. - Did you see her eyes? - What? - Her eyes. - Shit, no, I was too busy trying not to piss myself. - She looked scared. Like, real scared. - Yeah, she's a good actress. - I don't know, that was almost too real. - Yeah, that was over the top. - Of course it was, how else are they gonna get people to flake out? - I don't wanna go any further. - What? Come on! - Amber, we've come this far, I mean, what could be worse than what was back there? - I don't know, that's what scares me. - Let's just do one more, and if we can't handle it, then we'll be done. You can't leave me here, come on. You can't let these guys think they're braver than us. We'll never live that down. - All right - Nice. - Amber coming through in the clutch. Hey, think how awesome it's gonna be to be able to say we were the first ones to ever make it all the way through. Look, I got you, OK? If you want out, we'll all go, all right? Let's see what's next. - What the? - OK, how did? - We're outside. Like, actually outside, not in a room made to look like outside. - We went down three sets of stairs, though. - Guys. - What the? - How did they do that? How did they do that? - It's just me. - Jesus. - You guys feel weird? - Yeah. - Yeah, I don't know, but yeah. - Like in horror movies when it's really quiet and you think something's gonna jump out. - God damn it, you're such a jerk sometimes. - Oh come on. - It's not funny. Jeez, calm down. - What is that? What are you doing? - Well, we can't just stand here all night. - Yeah, that's gotta be the way to go, why else would there be a light? - Come on. - Something's up there. - It's just speakers up in the trees, don't worry about it. - I heard something. There. Didn't you hear that? - I don't hear anything. - Yeah, me neither. - How do you not hear that? Amber. Amber. - Amber. Amber? - Amber. - How did she, she was just here. - Amber, Amber! Where'd you go? - Amber? - Amber, can you hear me? Maybe she's just fuckin' with us, guys. - Amber, no way she would do that. Oh my God, Amber! - Amber! If you hear us walk towards our voice! - Amber! - Shh, Mel, it's OK. - It's not OK. - Look at me! - It's not OK. - Look at me! - This is your fault! It's a haunted house, they aren't gonna do anything to any of us. The worst thing they could have done is separated us somehow. - We have to find her. - I will, just calm, just calm down. Don't worry about it. - I'm scared. - We'll just leave, OK? - We have to find her, we have to find her. I don't know where she's gone, but we have to find her. We have to find her, OK? - She's probably gonna be watin' for us at the exit, OK? - Yeah. - OK. OK, we have to move towards it. - Now remember, it's just a haunted house, they're not gonna do anything to any of us. Come on. - Well this is quaint. - Yeah. - Wet. - What do we do? - I don't wanna do this. What are you doing? - Just lookin', chill. What? Oh, shit. Screw this, let's get the fuck out of here. - Ryan! God damn it! God damn it! - Nate! Nate, can you hear me? Nate! - Ryan! Get back, I'm gonna kick it in. Ryan, Ryan! - Ryan, Ryan! - Shh, it's all right. - No, Nate, he was just here, what the Hell happened to him? Ryan! - It's only a haunted house, it's only a haunted house. - I don't want to do this anymore. I'm done, seriously, I want out. - I know, Mel, I-- - No, I'm done. I want out now. - Well so do I. How the fuck do you suggest we do that? Look around. - Well if we want out, they have to let us out. We're done! We want out, please let us out. Hello, let us out! Let us out, God damn it, let us the fuck out! Shh, it's all right. You all right? - No. - Dumb question. Looks like all we can do is keep moving forward, find an exit, all right? - Move forward, huh? Which direction do you suppose that is? - Well we were obviously supposed to see this. I mean, they wanted us to get split up with their Hou-little-dini shit here. I guess we just keep going that way, all right? - Don't let go of me, promise. - I promise. - Nate! Shit. All right. This sucks. Hello, anyone there? Hello? Fuck. Hello? Hello? Hello? I'm an idiot. Worst idea ever. Fuck it. Fuck. No, no. No, no, no No. Why are you doing this? Why? - Help! Hello? Please, help me. Please. Help me, please. - Where the Hell are we? - I don't think this is a normal haunted house. - What do we do? - Find a way out. Come on. - What is that? What? - It's... - What? - It's nothing, come on. - Nate? - No. Oh God, oh God. - What is it Nate? - I didn't know, I swear. - What? - Oh my God. - What is it, talk to me. - Oh fuck. - What is going on. Nate, talk to me, what is this? - I hit something. I messed up. Bad. It was an accident. - What happened, Nate? - I hit something, last year with my car. Nobody knows, nobody. It was raining and he was changing his tire, I. Look, I'd only had one beer. I swear. I must have drifted somehow, I don't. Look, I didn't know I hit him. I saw it on the news. - Jesus, Nate. - I know. Look, how does this place know? Look, that's impossible. Earlier inside, I saw a guy, in a raincoat. And I thought it was - How is it possible? - This guy. It's not. - You remember when I got freaked out by that picture on the wall? - The carnival one? - No, well, yeah, it wasn't a carnival. Not at first. - Well what was it? - It was a picture of me and my uncle when I was eight. - That's weird, but not really all that scary. - Well that's because you didn't know. My uncle was, um, sick. And my father knew it. And he let him, do stuff to me. - Jesus, Mel. Hurry, come on. Come on, Mel! Go, come on! What is it? - I, I know this place. - Well, where are we? - We're in my uncle's house. - Hello? - My son, the homo. - Dad, I'm - Little fucking queer. - Dad. - No son of mine is gonna be a fag. - Dad, don't, don't say that. I'm sorry. Dad, please. - You shut the Hell up. - Nate, please. - Don't talk to me, homo. - Dad, please. - I always knew there was something queer about you. You ain't no son of mine, you're just a whiny little faggot that needs to know that shit don't fly around here. - Nate, Nate, please. No, no! - Where are you going? - This is where it all happened. - Come on, let's get the fuck out of here. - No, no, no, I can't be down here, no I can't be-- - No, there's nothing here. - You don't understand. I cannot go down here, Nate. - We have to. Come on, is there another way out? Mel, come on, I need you. Is there another way out down there? - There's stairs to the garage. - OK, good, come on. Mel. We'll be fine, OK? Come on, hey. I won't let anything happen to you. I'm not gonna let anything hurt you, OK? Come on. Come on. Come on. It's all right. Hey, princess. - It was our anniversary. He was on his way home from work and, we were gonna go to the lake for a week like we had done every year. He worked so, so hard. And he loved it so much. - I didn't know. - So hard, gave me everything, and then you took him. - I didn't know, oh God. God, I'm so sorry. Oh God, I'm so sorry. - And now we take you. No! - Please, help me, please. Mom, Dad. Oh my God, please help me. - Don't you dare take the good Lord's name in vain. - What? Please, help me. Something's not right here, this, this place this awful place. - Oh something is most certainly not right here. You need to confess to what it is you did, Amber Lynn. - I, I, - How long have you been whoring around? - What? Mom, no, look, Mom. - Don't you lie to me, Amber, don't you make this any worse. You been doin' things you shouldn't. Runnin' around, being a little slut. - No, Mom, no. - No? I cannot believe you are gonna sit there in that spot and lie to my face. How in the Lord's name do you think that happened? - Mom, Daddy, no. No This is impossible. Please, help me, this can't be real. Mom, I, I, Mom. We were, we were messing around and it just, it went too far, I didn't think it could, and it did, and then I got scared. - You think you killed that life inside you. - Mom, I'm so sorry, I didn't know. No! No, no, no, no, please. No, no, no, please. No, no. No, no. No. No, no, no! Hey, Princess. - No. - Oh, I've been missin' you. I've been missin' you, you're all grown up, but you smell the same. - No, no, get off me. - You still a wildcat, hmm? You still a little wildcat, huh? - Mom, Mom? Mom? Mom, where are you going? Mom. No. - Mel, Mel. - Jesus, Mel, do you hear me? - Here, help me get her up. - It's OK, Mel. - Slow, slow, slow, slow. - Jesus, Mel, can you hear me? It's OK, Mel. - It's OK. - It's OK. Just a bump on your head, we got you. - What happened? I saw crazy things, crazy. - I know - We saw them, too. - We're gonna get the Hell out of here. - How? We're-- - We made it out, we called the cops. - I don't understand. - It's all right, let's go. - Come on Mel, it's OK. - Holy shit. - That is amazing. - Oh my God. No. No, this can't be. This isn't possible. Guys, look. Are you seeing this? Oh my God. No, no, no! No, no! Can't you hear me? Don't go in there. Stop, Nate! No! - Nobody escapes Purgatory. - What do you want with us? - We got what we wanted. You. - Why are you doing this to us? You found us. - You're not real. The story, the house, it's just an urban legend. - Legends start somewhere. To keep a fire going, sometimes, you need to add fuel. - I don't understand. Please don't. - Mel's text said that this is where it is. This is Melanie, leave a message. Must not have any service, all their phones are going straight to voicemail. Where the Hell are they?
