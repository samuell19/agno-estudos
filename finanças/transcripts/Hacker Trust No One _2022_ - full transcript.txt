[electronic beeping] [air whooshing] [metal clanking] [electronic beeping] [electric hissing] [dramatic music] [upbeat electronic music] [computer chiming] [mouse clicking] [gentle music] [mouse clicking] [message beeping] Hey. Um, hey. You're so not my type. See ya. [disappointing music] [mouse clicking] Okay. A glutton for punishment. Hi. Hi. My name is Monique. I'm Danny, Danny Miles. Are we supposed to share last names? That seems kinda dangerous. What if you Facebook stalk me or something? Yeah, I didn't think about that. You're right, that's weird, sorry. Okay, so I'm just Monique. Cool. This is my first time using Dating Roulette, my first night, I mean. Oh, I do it all the time. Virtual dating kills the jitters for the real thing, you know? Yeah. So, - what do you do? - I don't know what to say, I- - Sorry, you go first. No, you. You, please. [mouse clicking] [mouse clicking] I didn't mean hot librarian as in bad. I'm in the hot librarian as in, you know. I know exactly what you meant and it's demeaning. [sighing] But I was just trying to flirt. You could have given me a compliment instead of turning me into an object. Jerk. Look, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Nice job, Danny. Nice job. You have such a nice smile. [laughing] Thanks, so do you. And you seem like a nice person too. Thanks, you seem kinda nice too. Great. So how about you ask me a question? Um... So you can get to know me better. Oh. Is there anything you'd like to be asked? Huh, um, no. I just thought you might have. Oh. Danny, I'm gonna give you some advice, okay? You really need to think about who you're talking to, yeah? And, like, maybe ask questions next time. [disappointing music] [mouse clicking] Stupid, stupid, stupid. [Danny sighing] Okay, let's try this again. Don't be weird. Just be cool. Be yourself. Be cool. Be yourself, be cool. Just be cool, yeah. [keyboard clicking] Okay. [Alyssa] Hey. Er, hey. Is your connection working properly? I can hear you, but I can't see you. [Alyssa] Yeah, it's working fine. But you're not on screen. I know. I'm tired of talking to weirdos. Are you a weirdo? I don't think so though. Though I have been called a weirdo a few times lately though. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Maybe you're one of those weirdos who's normal enough to admit you're a weirdo. The real question is, would you consider yourself a creep? No. What is this, a dating app or an interrogation? An interrogation, obviously. Well, in that case, I want my lawyer. No lawyers allowed, you're stuck here with me. [Alyssa laughing] I've been in worse situations. Stuck with me and my probing questions. You all right, Danny325? Please, call me Danny. I'm Alyssa. So, I don't actually use this app for dating. Then what do you use it for? I use it for practice dating, like, not dating dating. I mean, what are the actual chances of me finding someone on here I actually like? I dunno it could be, er, a million to one. More like a billion to one. [both laughing] So practice date question. What kind of things do you like? I like cars, I like computers, I like reading, I like numbers. Like just then I was thinking, when you asked, we could get the probability. If we got the stats from the dating app, we could find out the number of unique dates versus successful matches. You are such a nerd! [laughing] We're on a practice date and you're thinking about maths. Hey, I always think about maths. Well, cut it out then, weirdo. [laughing] Okay. You thinking about maths again aren't you? I'm sorry, I can't help it. Maths is in everything. You are a lost cause, Danny325. I know, believe me, I know. Now, don't take this wrong kinda way. You are a handsome-ish kind of guy. Why aren't you out there chasing real world girls? Thanks. I guess it's 'cause I'm too nervous. I don't think I'd really call myself handsome. No, I can't let you get away with that. Here's a practice date pro tip. You're going to have to chuck out this whole nervous, nice guy act. It's really not working for you. Oh. What if I can't help it? That's just who I am. Well then, you're screwed, handsome or not. [laughing] Thanks. For what, emasculating you? For the advice. It's nice to talk to someone cool for a change. No, you're cool, Danny325. This might not be a match made in heaven, but I definitely enjoy talking to you. [magical music] Oh. [phone ringing] [mouse clicking] If it's not the myth and the legend! How are you doing, Danny Boy? I'm feeling too old to be called a boy these days, man. Ah, don't let life get you down, Danny. Don't wanna hear none of that pussy-ass bitching coming out of your mouth. It's never too early to realize your dreams and all of that, you know? You still got some, right? What, dreams? Right now, I'd just settle for a job. I'm cooped up inside all day, playing video games. A waste of my time, waste of my life. [laid back music] Could call Klaus for a job. I hear that lucky son of a bitch is rolling in crypto riches right now. He's got like what? Five startups financed off of this Klaus Coin. I don't feel like hitting Klaus up, for a job or anything else. [laid back music] Nah, I can understand why you wouldn't wanna go to Klaus asking for a job right now. What else you got going on? Nothing, like literally nothing. I tried online dating, but it's not going too well. Really? Could've fooled me. Just being in your presence, I feel so uplifted. Like a weight has been taken off my shoulders. Any girl would be lucky to have a guy like you. Really? No man. You're like a 10 ton ampoule. A drain on my game. No chick is waiting to have the life sucked out of her, dating app or not. Look, try putting a smile on for a change. Don't take it all too seriously. Girls on those dating apps are just wasting time anyway. Same as you, know what I mean? Yeah. I don't know how I became so boring. [laid back music] I know. I know exactly how that happened. Come on, come on, fire. Fire, fire, come on, fire, burn, burn, burn! Come on. [keyboard clicking] Come on, he's only got a little bit of health left, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Oh shit, um. [notification beeping] Hey. Er, crap, hold on a second. [keyboard clicking] Are you playing a video game? [laughing] No. That was, er, um, yeah, Warriors of Everstone. Which is a video game? Yeah. Welcome to Friday night. [laughing] Video games and eating pizza. Oh, all dressed down with nowhere to go? Maybe we could keep each other entertained. Yeah, sure. What'd you have in mind? No funny stuff. Your mind which a filthy place then, didn't it? Um... Didn't it? Well, I wouldn't say filthy. We're just practice dating for now, mister. So that means just talking. So, say something interesting. Hmm, something interesting. Now you're just being cheeky. Beware, because I will out-cheek you any day of the week. Noted. But what does that look like? Hmm? Being out-cheeked, it just sounds weird. Well, I guess it looks like you being humiliated and me celebrating with glee. Right, okay, yeah. That sounds about right. You're a curious guy, Danny. Why is that? Because you ask funny questions and you say very little. You're also a little bit deadpan. I've never understood what that means. Well, it means you looked dead like a pan. [laughing] Oh. Bet you think you're a real sly dog. There it is again. What does a sly dog look like? I don't know. [laughing] Like argh. Oh, like an ugly pirate. Who are you calling ugly? Oh, I was calling your sly dog ugly, not you. But me and my sly dog are indistinguishable from one another. How can you call us that? Sorry, I'm an actress. Was that a bit over the top? Er, just a little. God, everyone's a critic. Are you really an actress? I am. And a part-time waitress. But mostly a full-time waitress. I mean, that must be fun though. Waiting tables? Being an actress. Oh, um, with the right role. Do you have a boyfriend? Well, that was a bit of a jump. I am currently unattached. Happily unattached. Happily unattached and still on a dating app. Same as you. Just because I'm happy, doesn't mean I'm not lonely. Yeah, I guess the two aren't mutually exclusive. No, they're not. Everything okay? Yeah, sorry. I just went to a super serious place then. I'm back now. So what do you do? I'm a computer programmer. Well, an out of work computer programmer. I don't know any programmers. What's that like? It's like a being a professional puzzle solver. Cool. Tell me more. Well, someone gives me an assignment and then I see it like a puzzle, you know, something needs solving or fixing or creating. And then I create magic. Aren't computers as un-magical as it gets? No, not at all. You know spells have magic words, right? Well, programming has its own spells, languages that can be rolled into infinite possibilities. There's hidden instructions running beneath us all the time. Like the code that looks after your computer, cell phone, even this web app, you know? Data gets sent from the camera and then programming and code allows us to speak. Being a programmer is just like being a wizard. That was almost romantic. If it wasn't weird. [laughing] [laughing] Well, your brain does the same thing too. You know, it's just seeing things based on patterns it's already made up. You know, 80% of what you see, hear and think is already pre-planned, we're just thinking machines, interpreting the world, also using thinking machines, interpreting the world. Ah, my head hurts! Oh, sorry. That's that's another thing I'm good at, cutting off any sense of romance. I didn't kill off anything. I'm still here. Oh, you said you were an actress. I did. What's that like? What's it like being an actress? It's like, um, it's like, er, I don't wanna talk about it. [laughing] Oh, why not? I just don't wanna talk about it. What the hell, man? Sorry, I didn't mean to. I was just curious. Fine. You wanna know what it's like to be an actress? It's like being in front of the whole world all the time, being judged and evaluated. Knowing your tits, your ass, your figure. That's all they really care about. So you fail auditions all the time, and you fail till you get to a point where you wanna hold every casting director at knife point and just scream at them for wasting your time. And you're just one of thousands of actresses all fighting for a role you never even had a shot at landing. And all you wanna do is inspire people. So you're stuck. Stuck waiting tables, stuck dying inside. Just stuck. [computer beeping] Oh man. No, Mum. Yes, Mum. [rock music] Yeah. No, I changed the oil in my car last week. Yep, yep. I get it all delivered now. Yeah, yeah, straight to the door. I am. I've been looking. No, no luck yet. Yes, I remember him. No, I don't speak to him anymore. Yes, I'm aware he's rich. Yeah, filthy rich, yes, thank you. Right. Fine. Okay. Hmm. Okay, come on, just do it, okay. [phone ringing] I guess it's over. [door clicking] [computer beeping] [keyboard clicking] [gentle music] That would suck. Why not? [phone ringing] I dunno why I called you. That okay, I don't need a reason. If I tell you anything else about myself, you'll realize how much of a mess I am. It's okay, you don't have to talk about yourself. Well then, what else is said to talk about? Well, I can tell you something about myself, if you want to. I'd love that. I, I was in prison until recently. I only got out a few months ago. I was caught hacking. Oh, wow, when you said you were a programmer? Yeah, I'm also a hacker. Was a hacker. I'm on probation. [sighing] I exposed a non-profit company that were diverting funds to personal accounts, money that was meant to go to animal shelters was ending up in the personal accounts of the CFO. I thought I covered my tracks, but they traced the hack back to me. And then they put me behind bars. What about the nonprofit guys? Did they go to prison too? Not all of them, and not for as long. I was in there for a few years. That's so messed up. Tell me about it. You know, I went for two interviews recently for tech startup companies, and by law, I have to tell them about my conviction, so both of them turned me down. What are you gonna do? Get any job I can, I guess. Life can be so unfair sometimes I grew up in the foster system, so didn't even know my parents. [laughing nervously] It's okay, you don't have to talk about yourself. It's okay. I was poor as a kid, like really poor. My foster dad used to pay me a pound to mow the lawn, and I knew it wasn't much then, but I earned it. Finally saved myself up enough money to buy a ticket to London, and by 17, I was sleeping on the streets. Then I got lucky, found myself a few rich boyfriends, some were even famous. Some hit me. Some didn't. Either way, it never worked out. So now I'm back to being a nobody. You're not a nobody, Alyssa. Sorry, I'm, I'm no good at this. [moving music] You were doing fine, for a second. [laughing] Have you heard of Klaus Coin? No. It's a cryptocurrency I helped create with a friend of mine. Is it like Bitcoin? Kind of. I created the algorithm with this guy and he initialized the blockchain whilst I was still inside, so now he's rich and I have... He didn't give you anything? I can't even prove that I was a co-developer. So, he even named it after himself. There's no evidence at all? None. He was supposed to be my friend, but I used to think he was pretty cool. Couple of people suggested that I reach out to him. What for? See what my options are. I guess I could see why that might be a good idea. I mean, who knows, right? Just do it. [mouse clicking] Can't believe my eyes. Danny, is that really you? Hi, Klaus. I'm so sorry to hear about what happened. It's really not fair that you should be jailed for exposing that scum, very bad news. Thanks. It wasn't easy. Understood. Look, I've got meetings all day. You know, my time is very valuable. Tell me, to what do I owe the pleasure of this call? Well, I was just wondering if you snuck any Klaus Coins away for me. Snuck away any Klaus Coins, why would I have done that? Because I helped make them. They're called Klaus Coins, not Danny Coins. Yeah, but I still helped develop the algorithms for them. Even if that were true, which for the record, is not, any script kiddy can write blockchain. It takes support to develop and maintain blockchain, to nurture blockchain. I did these things, now we have Klaus Coin, which is worth 10K a piece by the way. This is due to my hard work. Yeah, you did do that, but I helped. And I thought we were friends. [Veronica] Klausy, the other girls pushed me into the pool and now I'm all wet. Veronica, say hello to my little friend, Danny. [Veronica] Hi Danny, are you gonna come join us at the pool party later? Ah, he won't be able to join us, he's not local, he's in, er... Portsmouth. Portsmouth. It's cold over there, yeah? Stay warm, Danny. We'll be in touch, we'll talk another time. Veronica, say goodbye. [Veronica] Mwa, bye Danny. Bye, Danny. [phone beeping] Shit. [desk banging] [somber music] Gutted. [water trickling] [cigarette packet crinkling] [cigarette paper rustling] [notification beeping] [somber music] Well, you've not met my friend, Katie. She is more stubborn than a Texan bull. [laughing] Are Texan bulls known to be stubborn? Yes, more stubborn than any other bull. And she's just like them. Anyway, so the security guard comes up with all of our clothes, and we're just so drunk, we kinda just grab them and stumble away. Somehow I managed to get home in an Uber without scratch. You are wild and adventurous. I might as well be a cardboard box. I'm sure that's an adventurous soul in you somewhere. Hmm, the hero who desk to defy corruption. That takes bravery. Mm, or stupidity. They're not- - Mutually exclusive? I guess maybe I shouldn't use the word hero. Hmm, criminal. Don't be so hard on yourself, Daniel San, when you're not like this, you can actually be a lot of fun. Thanks, I think. Danny, you're one of the good guys. So loosen up a little bit. So tell me more about this girl, man. Well, she lives in London, I live in Portsmouth, but long distance relationships are doomed anyway, aren't they? [upbeat music] Says who? Says everyone. But if it were possible, you could move. [Danny laughing] I don't think we're in that point of our relation-dating-ship. All right, okay. [upbeat music] If you were there, would money be the only problem? Well yeah, but... Well, doesn't seem so doomed to me. Seems to me like you like her. I do, yeah. I do like her. [phone ringing] Hi. Hi. Happy Friday. Happy Friday. It's everything okay? No. Yeah. I'm sorry, Danny. I don't really know what to say. That's okay. Sorry, I've gotta go. What? [computer beeping] Why? [Danny sighing] There's gotta be a reason, there's no need to be weird. It's cool, it's fine. [Danny sighing] Something's gotta be wrong, so. It's fine, it's cool, it's okay, it's okay. [sighing] Something's wrong, but she doesn't want to talk about it. It's fine, it's okay. It doesn't mean a big deal. Just try and call her again. [keyboard clicking] Okay. [phone ringing] Come on. Come on, pick up, come on. [phone ringing] Come on. [Danny sighing] Hello, Daniel Miles. Can you hear me okay? Hello, yes. Yeah, I can hear you all clear. And I can hear you. How are you Daniel? Please call me Danny. I'm, I'm okay, I'm just a little nervous. I'm sure you'll do fine. I see you have a lot of coding experience. Uh, before we go any further, I just want to be completely open and honest with you. Well, we always appreciate honesty. Um, okay, er, I do have a previous conviction, but I've served my time and I'm clean now. Oh. I hope this doesn't affect my chances of working with you. Unfortunately, our company policy doesn't allow us to hire former convicts. We've got so many applications for this position that it's more than likely that will negatively affect your chances. Frankly, I just don't see how this could work for us. Would you mind telling me a bit more about that? Um, sure. I hacked into the personal accounts of a CFO that was diverting funds from a nonprofit organization. I realize that my actions were wrong and I've done my time. [tense music] Well, I would have to pass this on to a superior to sign off on it. Company policy does have zero tolerance on criminal convictions and we have so many applicants. So it really depends on how well we feel you would fit into our organization. [sighing] Right. [cigarette paper rustling] Come on. [keyboard clicking] [phone ringing] [cigarette paper rustling] [Danny sighing] Guess not. [paper rustling] [phone ringing] Alyssa? [Alyssa] I'm here. I can't see you, it's, it's, it's really dark. [Alyssa] The camera's turned off. Is, is everything okay? [Alyssa] Not really. Is there anything I can do? [Alyssa] I'm gonna turn the camera on now, so don't freak out. Okay? [sad music] Alyssa. Not feeling too pretty today. Did someone do this to you? I asked you not to freak out. I'm not. I am. Nobody should be allowed to hit you ever. Who did it? My ex. He was waiting when I got home. Standing outside my porch. I should've ran the moment I realized it was him. Have you gone to the police? Never makes a difference. It's not the first time, you know? It's not right, it's not right at all. I'm just so angry right now. I can't do this. I can't do this, I can't do it, I can't do it, I can't do it! [electronic hissing] Alyssa. Alyssa! [tense music] I don't know if I can do this. [Danny sighing] Oh fuck. If I do this, this is... [music intensifying] I don't have a choice. [Danny sighing] Fuck. [Danny sighing] I've got what I need. Okay. [keyboard clicking] Okay. [keyboard clicking] Okay, I need a browser extension. [keyboard clicking] [Danny sighing] What else do I need? Anti-trace program, E X E dot run. [Danny sighing] Okay. [keyboard clicking] Am I really gonna do this? I need a second opinion. [phone ringing] What's up, man? Zeke, am I a piece of shit? Everyone's a piece of shit, don't let it get to you. No, I mean it, man, I just- - Well, what's going on? It's this girl, I really like her, and I'm worried. Dude, you're a catch, stop worrying so much. I'm worried that something's wrong. Look, last time I spoke to her, she had this bruise on the side of her face and she told me it was her ex. Sounds like this one's got baggage. Oh, shut up for a second, man, I'm worried, I'm worried that something's gonna happen to her. Should I try and do something about it? What are you gonna do? Like you said, she's at a distance. You and I both know that I'm not suggesting I go up there. Right? [Danny sighing] Does it make me a creepy stalker if I have a rummage around? Or does it make you the heroic knight who's saving the princess? I've already done time for this shit, man. Yeah, but this time you're the hero. I was the hero last time. Mm, yeah, well this is not exactly high profile stuff, you know? You probably won't get caught. Yeah, you're probably right. Be careful, man. [electronic hissing] [tense music] [Danny sighing] [keyboard clicking] Glasgow? It's a false account. Am I really gonna do this? I'm telling you, it's not that easy. [Captor] I don't wanna hear about how hard it is. Just do what you're goddamn told. [Alyssa screaming] [handcuff rattling] [Alyssa] Ow, ow, ow. [Captor] Get up. Get off! [Alyssa screaming] Shit. Shit! Get off! Go, go, stop! - What did I do now? - Shut up! He's watching. Everything's fucked. What are you talking about? He's on the other end of that camera. Who? Danny. You're there, Danny, aren't you? Who are you? I'm not gonna answer that question. He's kept me locked up. Be quiet! I'm the one doing the talking. Oh, Danny, I know who you are. I know you probably have a lot of questions. But we are in the middle of a crisis. It was never gonna work. It was gonna work until you fucked everything. You have one thing to do, or you die. Don't hurt her! Then do exactly as I say. And she will be fine. Who are you? I can answer that question, but then you'll just ask more. I like to keep things simple. Let's just say I'm the guy that made this happened. Why? Why me? Why her? That's going to become very clear very quickly. You do as I say, and she'll walk out of this alive. Danny, I need you to put the middle finger up to your buddy Klaus. Hack into his chain, his blockchain in Frankfurt, and shut that shit down. Taking out his farms will destroy him. Yeah, dude. I can't. You can't or you won't? You, say you won't again? Stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop. I don't even know how. Danny, you're one of the very few people who can. That's why I picked you. You're one of Klaus Coin's secret founders. I'm not a founder, I was in prison. I have zero control over- - You know how to take control. Maybe. It's not going to be easy. I don't care about easy. I'm going to give you three hours, three hours to shut him down. How am I supposed to take out his render farm? Figure it out on your own. That's why I picked you. It's 8:43. You have until 11:45 to take down Klaus's side of the chain and wipe it from existence. I don't- - Danny! Just stop being a pussy. Just do it. Danny! Stop, stop, stop! [Alyssa crying] Clock is ticking. Wait, I need to see she's safe. Fine, you can have the bedroom camera. Oh. And if you phone the police, she's dead. [Danny sighing] Holy shit, Danny, holy shit. Take out Klaus Coin? Oh my god. Okay. [keyboard clicking] Okay, cool. Oh, Danny, what's up, man? [tense music] Zeke, I need a package of tools, I need everything you've got. Whoa. Everything? I thought you were on probation. Yeah, I am, but there's something I gotta do. Well, I mean, I can get you the tools, but I don't have them on me. Okay, well who does? You're not gonna like this. Oh, fuck, it's Luke, isn't it? You asked man, that's where it's at. [sighing] Okay, thanks. They have a map of networks for spoofing and anti-trace? Yeah, you know they do. Great. You know, I never took you for the break probation type. Always thought you're a goody two shoes. Yeah, well I can surprise people. Well, it must be important, whatever's got you greased again. Yeah, you could say that. You could say it's important. Well, if you're going to go break bad, you come to the right place. So what kind of mischief you plan? I don't know if I can tell you, man, You really going to be like that? Dude, I've had your back from the beginning, during and after the big house. Fuck, whatever, man. All right. Do you know when a guy named Arash Addie? Maybe. Okay, well, I need everything you've got on him. Okay, but you're not planning to mess with him, are you? What if I have to? Dude, he's no two-bit player. The guy was there when Klaus Coin took off, and he's knee-deep with some very, very dodgy people. You know, the kind that would leave you at the bottom of the ocean? Yeah, well, I'll consider myself properly warned. [engine humming] Come on, move! Light's green, asshole, let's go. Fucking Jesus. Come on, come on, red lights again? [Danny sighing] I don't have time for this shit. Come on. Come on, change, come on. [alternative music] [engine rumbling] Right, I know he's round here somewhere. Come on, where are you, where are you? [Danny sighing] Right, okay. Let's do this. [keys jangling] [Danny sighing] Let's bring you along with me. Come on, Luke. [gate banging] Come on, man. Come on, man, I don't have time for this. Hello to you too. The fuck you doing showing your face here? [Danny] Look, I know, but I'm in a jam. I need your help right now. Fuck off. [Danny] You owe me, Luke. I don't owe you shit. So why don't you step back before I fuck you up? [Danny] I don't have fucking time for this. [gate clattering] [Luke groaning] Ah, the fuck are you doing, Danny? [Luke groaning] [Danny] You know why I'm here. You shouldn't be around me. [Danny] Five years. Five fucking years, Luke, I did for you man. I didn't open my mouth to anyone. Fucking anyone! Please. No. Not here, no, no. [garage door creaking] What have you got yourself into now? I can't get into it right now, but I'll tell you later. Zeke told me who you're messing with. You sure you know what you're doing? Yes. Everything that you need is in there. All numbers wiped and everything? Of course, what do you take me for? Do you want it back when I'm done? No, of course not. Fucking destroy 'em when you're done. Right. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? What? I've helped you, and that's as far as my help goes. Look, you can pick up a signal anywhere. Look, everything in there is all I can give you. That's all I can do. Right, okay. Thank you. Get the fuck out. Fair enough. [tense music] [garage door creaking] [keyboard clicking] [phone buzzing] [phone beeping] Hey man, how'd it go with Luke? He happy to see you? Very. I bet. He loves you, man. Oh yeah, we had a hug and a catch up, it was great. You found anything yet? Yeah, sure did. Sending it over to you right now. Got it. Dude. Are you sure you don't want me on this one with you? You know I do Z, but I think you're gonna have to sit this one out. Fuck, man. All right, whatever. Just watch your ass, all right? I will. [keyboard clicking] Okay, run trace. [Danny whispering] I am not losing this game. Okay, okay. [keyboard clicking] [Danny sighing] [phone ringing] Oh fuck, oh fuck no! Oh fuck. Fuck! [tense music] [electric beeping] [tense music] Why are you talking to Zeke and Luke again? Look, something's going on right now and I'm in a really tight spot. I'm getting messages you went to see your old partner and you left there wearing a backpack. He's still active. Bullshit. You're lying to me. Who do you think gave him all of those unmarked laptops? [door banging] Yeah, one minute. So where are you? Nowhere. [keyboard clicking] Public toilet, Commercial Road. [Danny sighing] Okay, look, I'm in trouble and I'm trying to save someone's life. Come on, Danny. Cut the bullshit. I'm telling you I need fucking help or someone's going to die. Look, look. [Alyssa moaning] What the fuck is going on, Danny? Look, I need access to all crypto files so I can begin to move cash for the transfers. Stop. You shouldn't be getting involved in any of this. You saw the videos. They've got this girl hostage, and they pretty much said if I don't do exactly what they tell me to, they're going to kill her. You should have contacted us. Didn't have time. You better not be lying. I'm not lying. Fucking Christ, I need your help. Look, track me and follow me. If I'm lying, you can put me away for the rest of my life. Please just help me. You know what I look like. Follow me, monitor me through CCTV. You can put me away for any bullshit. They're gonna fucking kill her. I'm monitoring you on that laptop you have. And if any action kicks off, keep your mobile phone facing the right way, I can access the camera remotely from here, and keep that laptop close by. I will. Danny, if you're lying to me, I'll put you away for so long, you'll never see sunshine again. I swear to Christ, I'm straight. Hmm, we'll see. I'll be in touch, kid. [tense music] [keyboard clicking] [Alyssa crying] Where's my money? I'm doing what you want, fucker, I need time. Where's the fucking money? The longer you keep talking to me, the longer it's gonna take for me to get your money. Show me Alyssa. You haven't done what I asked. Why would I show you to her? I had to wrestle a man with a machete to the fucking ground. Show me Alyssa. [laughing] How exciting. But none of that is my problem. I want my fucking money! Show me her. I'll do something better. [Alyssa groaning] Fucking move. Hey! I gave you a set of instructions and you didn't follow any of them. Don't you fucking hurt her. My money! Get my fucking money! Jesus Christ, you'll get your money. The next time I call and you don't have my money. [Alyssa crying] No, no, please stop. [knife chinking] Oh, mother fucker! [blood squelching] Oh, fuck you. I'm gonna cut every tiny little piece off of her, and I'm gonna film it, and I'm gonna send you updates, every fucking single stage, unless you get my money. Do you understand me? Oh no, fuck you! Do you understand me? Yes. Yes. You have 30 minutes. What? But, no! 30 minutes! Oh fuck. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. [tense music] [Danny sighing] [Man] Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock. [Danny] What the fuck did you just say? I told him already, I'm getting him the money! Do you have a fucking problem? No! [crying] [tense music] Okay. [Danny sighing] Okay. [Danny sighing] Okay. [keyboard clicking] [Danny sighing] You're not gonna like this plan. So don't say it. Look, this guy's not gonna stop until she's dead, and I can't let that happen. He's gonna kill me too. Danny, I know who's making you do this. [somber music] Please don't tell me it's Zeke. Yeah, we're watching him too. You think you know your friends, right? Did you find anything yet? Pretty much what I needed to know. You're in way over your head. These guys, they're professionals. Do you have a plan? Look, she needs my help. Have you moved the money out already? To the offshore accounts and through the black market, yeah, but I haven't changed the currency yet. Borrowed accounts? Just told you, almost done. I'm a little rusty. I see. [sighing] I'm running out of time. Do you want my help or not? Yes. Zeke locked down the location for this asshole. I'm not even able to trace the IP for long enough, and they keep scrambling their locations. You know, for a government agent, you sure are useless. The internet is a lawless place, Danny. You know that. When I got the lock on the location, we'll be moving in. Okay. I'll try and keep this asshole on long enough so you can get a trace on him. That could work, unless he's watching this, and she's already dead, and they're coming to kill you next. Well, that's why I have friends like you. Maybe. We're monitoring you, kid. Prick. [keyboard clicking] [Woman] It's him. Oh, stop it. [Woman] He's so sexy. Fuck off! [Woman] I'd do anything for him. Fuck's sake. [tense music] I did it. Fuck you, motherfucker, I did it. Okay, okay, okay, come on. Come on. [tense music] Pick up, asshole. Come on. You're free Alyssa. [Danny groaning] [tense music] [Danny groaning] [vomit splashing] [Danny coughing] [Danny panting] [water splashing] [tense music] [Danny groaning] [Danny groaning] [keyboard clicking] Come on. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Okay. [Danny panting] [phone buzzing] You don't look so good, are you okay? Do you remember when I asked you if I was a piece of shit? Are you bleeding? Fucking yeah. Do you remember when I asked you that? I think so, but dude, it doesn't matter, man. We need to get you some help. Well, now I know that you're the piece of shit, and I'm never gonna forget that. Look, look, look, look, look, look, look. [Danny panting] Okay. Okay. [Danny groaning] Oh shit. Oh fuck, okay. Okay. Okay. [Danny groaning] Oh shit. [Danny groaning] Okay, okay. [Danny panting] Okay. Oh, you can do it, okay, you can do this. Okay, okay. Okay, here we go. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. [Danny panting] [Danny screaming] Okay, one more, okay, one more, okay. Come on, gotta get you clean. Okay, okay, come on, come on, don't be a pussy. Don't be a pussy, okay, come on. [Danny panting] [Danny screaming] [phone ringing] I see you got my money. Good job. Good job. And for that. I know that's not Alyssa. You're bluffing. Well, she's no use to me now. It'll add to your prison time. I've already gotten away with it. [Danny laughing] Something funny? [Danny groaning] Actually, yeah. See you had a little accident there. What the fuck is so funny? After all this, I just wanted to smoke, and I haven't got a fucking lighter. You're not too bright, are you, Eric Maine from Southampton? [laughing] What did you do? [Danny groaning] Why don't you check your emails? You're fucking dead. You're done, Eric. I'd probably say you have about five minutes left. [police siren blaring] I'm gonna find you. I don't care how long it takes. But I will find you, and I will burn you to the ground. I'd like to introduce you to a friend of mine. We've been looking for you, Mr. Maine. Who the fuck is that? This is Detective Julian. He's the piece of shit that put me away before. I guess it's true what they say. The enemy of my enemy. Fuck you. [sirens blaring] I wouldn't call him a friend, but he certainly isn't any friend to you either. [door banging] [sirens blaring] I wouldn't do that if I were you. [sirens blaring] Clock's ticking. You're fucking dead! [sirens blaring] [door banging] Yeah, so I heard. [door banging] [sirens blaring] [Danny panting] [electric hissing] [dramatic music] Hello, I am Dominic Kwong. Welcome to the Vlog Press. So we've all been paying close attention to the Klaus Coin conspiracy, and we are very lucky to have an exclusive interview here today with Danny Miles, the man at the center of it all. So tell me, you were betrayed by your best friend, fooled by the woman you love, and forced into criminal activities. How are you feeling? Broad question, but I'm feeling better, feeling better in myself, my wound's healing up nicely. So yeah, I can't complain too much. So how does someone like you, I think it's safe to say, an expert in your field, get fooled by the very thing that you know best? Well, I would say that anyone can be cat-fished and that it doesn't necessarily acquaint to your technical acuity with something. You know, at the end of the day, I thought I was building a relationship with someone. It turned out to be fake. As I said before, you were betrayed by almost everyone you trusted. Do you think you'll ever be able to trust again? I don't think it's necessarily going to be hard to trust anyone again, but going through this has really made me realize that not everyone is who they seem. So I'd say it's made me a better judge of character. So you have quite a history of hacking, and I believe you were even convicted of criminal activities. Can you tell me a bit about that? Yeah, sure. So as you, as you said before, I was, I was actually thrown in jail for my previous hacking, which was something that I thought I was doing for the right reasons. Apparently not, but this time was different. This time, the people that set me up knew exactly who I was. They picked me, they targeted me, and it's kind of hard to get away from that. So now this is all over, what's next? What does the future hold? What do I see in my future? Hopefully a successful relationship rather than one that doesn't go awry. I'm looking forward to making some new friends and hopefully these are friends that I can trust, but my name's clear now, so I'm really looking forward to having what you'd call a normal life. Thanks, yeah, I'm doing a lot better. Yeah, it's starting to heal. Well, I don't want to be, I don't want to be laid up forever. Did you see the article I sent you? [Danny laughing] Yeah, it must be nice to see me in the news for the right reasons for once. Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great, next weekend? Okay. I love you too, Mum. So how you feeling, kid? Ah, can't complain much. You did good. I'm glad it was legit. Look, I told you, I'm not going back inside. Who was the girl? You back on the dating scene already? Who was the girl? I don't really know. They're still processing her information. My best guess is that she was a rough sleeper, an easy target with nobody to report her missing. You know, you could always come and work for me and my team. Work for you? Send me back to the hole. Come on, Danny. Work for the good guys. [sighing] Look, I think you and me have different definitions of who the good guys are, but thanks anyway. Well, if you change your mind, you know where to find me. More like you'll be watching, right? Hey, who else is going to make sure you're okay? Ha, could have fooled me. Bye, kid. Watch yourself. Adios.
