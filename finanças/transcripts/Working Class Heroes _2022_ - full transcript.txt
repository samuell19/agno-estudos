Fucking mud. Open the door. I know you're in there. We're not talking to you any more. I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave the flat. We're not going anywhere, this is our flat. If you don't leave, we will call the police! First floor. Hello! Hello! Let me go! - I'm sorry. It's going to be fine. - I'm putting this online! Let him go! Bastards! Let my son go! You are fascists! Let him go! You'll go to prison! All of you! You're kicking us out of our own flat! - Calm down. - I don't wanna calm down! Calm down? It was easy for you to destroy our house in a day. FLATS FOR SALE Excuse me. Hey, miss! Miss.. Excuse me, it is my turn... FLATS FOR SALE I'm sorry madam, I didn't recognise you. - Thank you. - Have a nice day. Excuse me. Hurry. Hurry up! Look at all this concrete... It's crazy! Listen up! This place needs to be tidied up. This grass, the branches and the trees... First, get rid of all that! Got that? Come on! What's wrong? What's with the sad faces? You know our company works to the highest of standards. The best building materials... This is the only company that keeps the deadlines. And our company has never received any complaints. We settled on a flat a while ago... Great. I just wanted to ask... why the flat is not yet... legally registered? All right. You're insulting me. No, that's not what we want. Really? I told you. It's just a matter of a tiny formality. It'll take a day, a week maximum. It doesn't really matter. As you know, the bureaucracy is very slow in this country. You're calling me, Miki, a fraud. A conman who would leave a pregnant woman and her husband on the street. You said that. That's disgraceful. Please... I also live in this city. I'd like to live in Thailand, I'd like to live somewhere else, but I live here. My family is here. Everything I have is here. You have really insulted me. I thought we had a deal. - Lidija! - Sorry I'm a little late. Here is the contract. The keys, the stamp... I just need the signatures. Lidija, we may have a problem. What's the matter? The gentleman is worried about the property licence. That's just a formality. That's what I said. Well then, the deal is off. I have other clients interested. Paying in cash. All right. Wait, wait, Braco. I want to ask you... Ask... What are we building here? - Here? - Here. What do I know? And why do you care? Come on, work when you're told to, go on. Did you bring the stamps and the note? Everything is ready. Don't worry. All right. What about the priest? The bishop is coming. - The Bishop? - The Bishop. Great! Great Lidija, great. I can see the headlines: "Bishop consecrates foundations!" Well done! The only thing is, he asked us to build him a 100 metre road leading to that new church. - 100 metres? - Yes. No problem, we'll build the road to Mount Athos, for him to show up! He will! Where are you going? Go check the workers, they need to look like workers. And that place needs to look like a construction site. OK? OK. I understand. Bye! My Professor! Everybody has his own Hitler. She chases me like Death chases a grandmother. She chases me... I chase you... That dickhead chases her... Holy fuck... Life is nothing but a giant cock! Only troubles and worries. When will you pay us, Braco? Calm, Professor, calm. We are all in the same shit! We are not in the same shit, so, when do we get paid? You will be! You will be paid! Braco... When? Do you understand what I'm asking? When do we get paid? - When? - When? In a couple of days. We better be. Look, this is it. I don't know how we'll fix these papers. Don't worry! I know the right man. You do? What are you drinking? Huh, what am I drinking... I don't know.. What are you having? Something strong. If it continues like this, we will all leave. Well? A piece of cake! It's been a long day. Yes! It was. - Going for a beer? - Yes. Are we doing the thing tonight? I already told you, I'm not doing it! Say, kid, would you do something for me? You know I'll do anything for you, rain or shine. Just ask. But careful, it must stay between us. No problem. Have you ever handled a forklift? If I was your age, I'd get away from this country. Where, Professor, where? Anywhere, as far as possible. You think it's better out there somewhere? Yes it is, kid. A lot better. Do you read the news? You think it's only us here but it's bad everywhere. Shut up kid, and get us a beer. I'll bring us beers, but let me just say this. I wouldn't leave my country for all the money in the world. I love my country. I may be stupid, but I love my country. - Yeah, fine. - And I love it here! You love it here? He loves it here. Right in the middle! What did I win? I can keep this, right? A cute teddy! Here's something for the kids. I get the cash, and I'm buying beers all around. Deal? My back hurts. My son, what a whore can do... She broke my dick. Nobody else can do that. You're kidding me. You don't believe me? You don't have to... My b*lls have shrivelled up! I have rubbed them dry, put on that horse cream, I rubbed rakija on it. No use, my son, it hurts! But, what can I do, I love to fuck! What about me? What is it, Ringo? Nobody tells me... Man, I made one especially for you... Give it here. I take it back. This pig again! You keep complaining while I take care of you! It's better than in Hollywood. How about you, Mile, what do you say? What's the salami like? California Mile, remember, California! Good, you are making progress... "You shouldnt" should be written "You shouldn't". Correct this before you send it! - Come on! - I can't! You can, kid! I can't! Do you have a light? What is it, Professor? Nothing for us? They don't care I have nothing to eat! - Have you seen Ringo? - No. I can't! Come on! Stop, kid! Stop, you motherfucker, stop! What did you do, you fucking moron? - Ringo! - Look at me, Ringo! I'm gonna kill you, kid. I'll castrate you. Don't think about him. I'll lose my job. D*mn... I'll tell them everything! When the boss comes, - I'll tell her everything! - What will you tell? Boss! - Did you make any statements? - Yes. - Did you...? - No! Did you or didn't you? We didn't. - Are you sure? - Sure. All right. It was an accident. Take this, have some fun tonight. Now, beat it! Let's go! I said, let's go! What a mess! What... What are you looking at! Come on, kid! Hey, there is something in the van. Wow! Here he comes. Come on, boys! Kid. Why do we need this? European Union, my son. High standard. Here you are. This is too big for me. Look! - It has a strap. - Ah, OK. Here you are, Mile. Wow, so many pockets, this is great. You will get your suit, be patient. Here you are. Professor, we have to bring them back after the reportage. - OK. - Guys, Take care of your suits. Keep them clean, we have to bring them back. How can we keep them clean? Professor, can I ask you something? Yes? Please shave yourself. If you shave yourself, I will too. OK. Hey boys, make sure you look smart. Is this a reportage or some other kind of movie? No, we will fuck Braco in front of the cameras. There will definitely be some sex. Come on, take it. Shave yourself, you should look beautiful. While we are fucking you. One, two. Listen to me! Rehearsal begins in one minute. All of you move to the centre. I repeat! Rehearsal begins in one minute. Let's go. I am coming down. You look like porcelain dolls. Come on, zip it up. Zip it. Kid. Fix that. Zip it. Nice. Listen to me, someone should say a few words for the news. But, as none of you can talk properly, I decided that the Professor will speak in front of our crew. No way! Professor, you are the only one who went to university. Fuck off. That's what I'll say! Professor, you can't let me down. Professor, please, don't go. - I will say something! - What will you say? I will tell them about Ringo! What? - That it was your fault for Ringo. - My fault? - It is your fault! - My fault! I will kill you! I will kill you! You are fighting poor Mile, you prick. It is your fault. Calm down, Mile. Mile! I'll kill you! I will tell them everything! I don't want to see him again! Keep him away from me. Keep him away. Assholes! Crazy motherfuckers. I will tell them everything! Yeah, yeah, keep talking! I will fuck his fat mother! Thank you, Professor. - Here it is. Put it back in. - Thank you. Thank you so much. Take one to calm down. That's it. That's it. Thank you, Professor. One more. One more and that's it. That's enough. Let's go kid, come on. Listen. Stay there and don't move until this is over. OK? - OK, Professor. - Good. Professor? I will kill him. Sure, we will all kill him. Now stay there and don't move. I won't move. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. I'll wait for you. I'll get you when you least expect it. You'll see! You motherfucker. Come on guys, faster! Hey you. Stop there! Listen to me. Move that to the second floor. When the TV crew arrives, try and look like you are working. Got it? Come on. - Braco. - Yes. I'm listening. How would it look if we put this styrofoam in the middle? You are a genius. But listen to me, make it look good. OK? - Yeah. - Come on. Come on, hurry up, what are you waiting for? Christmas? Oh no! My Professor. I'm sorry. Mile, what have you done? It just came to my mind... Oh my God! Wait, wait, wait. D*mn! I want to kiss you. What are you doing? We are kissing each other. Let's go. Can you stand up? Hold his hand. I will take care of his hand. Mile, brother. Braco, I don't care if Mile was drunk. Let somebody patch him up, but I don't want to see him again near the site, do you hear me? - Have an orange. - Take it. Thank you. - Say thank you. - Thank you. I'll call you. Goodbye! I want you to pay everything that you owe me, every holiday I spent working... And 20,000 euros in cash. So I never have to see you again. I'll sue you. For illegal work, unregistered construction site, injury at work! Ringo, think about your child. Construction of the social housing building in Novi Sad continued after a long delay. Lidija Jakšić, Magnus Domus PR will tell us more. It's her job... to talk bullshit... The Magnus Domus Building team found the strength and courage to initiate such an investment. I have to say, we hope that German partners will join us. This project will be finished according to EU standards, meaning the highest quality. And I have to emphasise this is not only about our success, it is also a great pleasure, because we are doing an important thing for our people and for our country. As you already know, this social housing project stopped long ago, but we are going to finish the job to offer housing to young, married couples. And we expect a significant increase and birth rate improvement in Serbia. We have to finish this. If everything goes well, I'll give you a share. Once again, Serbia has the highest GDP in Europe... ...so let's pivot now for a minute to the gender gap... ... new jobs, and we should be proud of the results. I went to find a job today. And? Not a d*mn thing. It's important to keep trying. That's what I think, too. We saw you on TV today. It was great. Guys, here it is! The leftovers from the Bishop's visit. You can't get food like this, not even in Hollywood! What a feast! Say, kid, why are you so dressed up? Have you decided to stick it in? What do you care? I will help you, just don't fall in love. - What are you talking about? - Cheers! Come on guys, tuck in! There is pork, mutton... - Ah, big guy! - What? Where are you going? What are you looking at? Like you don't know... - No clue. - You have to tell us. Who knocked on the window? Don't make fun of me! - Can you see? - Yes. Come on, then. - Hey... - What? Where are you taking me? Why? Are you scared? - No. - Why do you care then? Is this like some romantic comedy, or what? What's the matter? Are you scared? - Me? - Yes, you! I wasn't scared when I had to climb a 50 metre high crane! Let's go to the seaside. Where to? My aunt lives in Sutomore. You know... I have never been to the seaside. - Really? - Really. Wait, you'll see. D*mn! Kid, why the long face? Nothing, Professor, nothing... Just one of those days. That's all... It didn't go well? Mind your own business. Listen, I didn't ask you before... Do you use a raincoat when... I don't understand. A raincoat, you know... What raincoat? I don't get it... A condom! Do you use it when... It's not what you think, Professor! - Really? - No. I was... just with her... We went for a walk. - And you chatted a bit... - Yes, we talked and... I see... you fell in love. If you don't fuck, you are in love! Stop it. Just tell me the best way to Sutomore. To where? To Sutomore, are you deaf? - To Sutomore... - What's so funny? Are you on holiday? Listen carefully! The boss called, we have to work today! No way! She is giving me hell because we are not done yet! It's Sunday, for Christ's sake! We are late with the campaign, we have to get everything done as quickly as possible! We're gonna work day and night if needed. - Professor! - We don't care, Braco! Pack your stuff, let's go! Let's go! Come on! Let's go! Let's go. It's our turn to have fun, without a raincoat. Come on, let's go! Game on! It's no use, Lidija. I even threatened to fire them, and nothing! - Who's behind it? - Who? The Professor! He's the leader. Time out! Do you know about tomorrow? I do. All right. What are your demands? All the money you owe us. That's all? And double the wages if you want us to work today. That's it. If you excuse me, I am in the middle of a very important game. Let's play! What are you staring at? I told you... Find your name and sign here. There you go. Next! We're going for a beer today. At the Belgrade Bar. What's the Belgrade Bar? That's the best way to Sutomore. Go! Get your money! Here, kid, have some. Now sign. Here you go! As far as I'm concerned, you would make a perfect wife. Is there a train tonight? My turn. What a day... I'm exhausted! Big boys! How are you? What do you want, Braco? It's a piece of cake, guys. Just hang this on the wall, and that's it! Braco, it's getting dark! We have to, Professor. The boss called, it's not my idea, remember? Now? Not a chance. No way. If I give you 10 euros each? - 20. - 20. You will do it tonight? We will. Let's get to work then! Good evening, girls! Welcome! Now this is something! Shall we postpone tomorrow's meeting? - Postpone what? - Signing the contract. I don't care! We should do this as soon as possible. I mean... - Hey! - What? You welcomed us like kings! Fuck, I have never seen this... Have you ever seen this? This is brilliant! Nobody has ever welcomed me like this! We wanted to make an effort. What did you say? I said we put effort into it! - An effort? - Yes. You really put in some effort. And it's an honour for us. Yes, an honour. The town's paying! What are they talking about? Professor, will this money be enough to pay back your debts? Part of it... How much? The interest. Just enough to buy some time. - Better than nothing... - Yes, it's not bad. I'm bored! Just ask! Are you fucking her? I am. I want to watch you fuck. Now? Now. I'm sick of you! I decided to take your advice. My advice? I am going travelling tonight. On the Belgrade-Bar train. You kidding? Yeah, that girl is waiting for me at the station. - Really? - Yeah. I'm leaving, fuck them all. Especially Braco and his big head. Good, just hit the road. Hey boys, here is some refreshment. Look at this. - Come on, Professor... - How did this happen? Braco has become a humanitarian? Sure, I might even learn to like him. See how our kid speaks? Like a real Professor! Cheers! But he fucks like Braco the foreman. Hey wait, what about the money? - Money? - Right, Professor? It's in my pocket. When you're done, it'll be in yours. Hurry up, there is another case of beer waiting for you. Don't disappear. We are done in 30 minutes. - Did you hear me? - Yes. Professor, I'm going upstairs to tie the ropes, you get that ready. - OK, go. - Let's go! - Hey! - What? When does your train leave? I'll be there on time. Don't worry. He'll be there. Of course he will. He's found himself a girlfriend. Kid? Hey, don't mess with me. Come on! Do you hear me? Kid? Kid, answer me, d*mnit! What have you done! Kid, can you hear me? Kid? Come on, open your eyes. Come on! What are you doing? He fell down. Fell down? Where were you? Is he breathing? Call an ambulance. Why do we need an ambulance if he is not breathing? What do I tell the boss? What can I tell him? The signing is tomorrow, and a man has just died. Professor... We are fucked. All of us. Professor! Hello? Hello, Braco? Hello? Where are you going? Braco called. I don't know, something is wrong. I guess they're drunk. I better go there and check. Yeah, better you go... And hurry back, you have a fan here. We are fucked. He will kill us all. We are fucked. We could have just hidden him. Kid? Kid? Kid? Breathe, breathe kid! Breathe! Just hurry, please! Who did you call? He's alive, Braco! Move away. Move away, you motherfucker! It's all right, my son. It will be fine, kid. Come on! Have a sip. Have some water. Fuck! Hey! Over here, guys! Over here! Hey! Police! - Good evening! - Stop right there! Who are you? I represent the company. What are you doing here, huh? I got a... They called me, something has happened on the site, so I came to check. We received a call about an an accident. Accident? I don't think so, it was probably just a mistake. And who are you? I am Lidija Jakšić, the company's PR. - PR? - Yes. - Did you hear that? - Yeah. - Where? - Over there. - Hey! - Do you have a night guard? We do. Junkies keep hanging around... We force them out, but... Hey! Police! Hey! See? I told you, they drink and use drugs here. Hey! What's this? Any idea? What's he doing here? What was that? Hands up! Drop it! Hands where I can see them! Drop it! Drop it! Get on the ground! Stop, that is the head of the construction site! What is he doing here in the middle of the night? We were just... And? - What? - Just hanging around. How many of you are here? Nobody...just... My Professor... Are you drunk? Are you drunk, you idiot? You got drunk! You got drunk, idiots! They are wasted. Don't you people have some other place to drink? Look at this one! Look at him! Is he asleep? We can't work like this! I agree, madam. You can't work like this. The construction site is not secured, drunk workers making a mess in the middle of the night. I don't know how it works at all. Where is your night guard? We do have a guard! We do. - Where is he? - I guess he is drunk as the others. He drank with them. - They are all drunk? - They are all drunk. Exactly. So, what do we do? Shall we take them to the drunk tank? What drunk tank? Please, officers, don't. Don't, please. We have a signing tomorrow, they have to work in the morning. There is so much to do still! Please, don't. Please, we all make mistakes. All right, madam, we'll leave it, this time. You sober them up. But next time... we will have to make a report. These are not working conditions! This is really outrageous! Thank you. And my apologies. Find your night guard. Yes, yes. False alarm! False alarm, guys! A bunch of drunks... Thank you, goodbye! All right bye, see you! Kid! Lidija. Lidija! What's wrong with him? He fell. He fell. Is he alive? He must go... to the hospital. He has to go to the hospital. To the hospital. Lidija! We have to get rid of him. Are you going to do it? Come on. Come on, do it. For your... boss. Fire us, come on. Or are you going to do it? Have you done it for him before? Arseh*les! Miserable motherfuckers! Let's go, kid. Wait, wait! No, stop! Don't move him, you'll hurt him even more. Braco, get the van! The keys! Hand them over! Where do you think you're going? To the hospital. - What? - To the hospital. To the hospital? To the hospital! Do you know what would happen then? I'd kill your mother! I'd kill your husbands and wives. I'd kill your children! You motherfuckers! You fucking motherfuckers. Pick that up! Pick it up. Make yourself useful. Please. They are our heroes! Please. Can you give me a ride? Where is your car? I'm out of fuel. Take a taxi. All right, get in. - Wait, stop, stop! - What? I forgot my bag. Just reverse a bit, please, there's a hole. Stop! That's good. Thank you!
