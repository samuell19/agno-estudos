Isana and, Terele in.... 'We are 18 Years Old' What a shame, I'm sick of these injustices! They always forget to announce me! Maybe it's envy, well, I work as well, the great Antonio Ozores! It is midnight, the wind blows very strongly outside.... lt is midnight.... ....aha.... It is midnight, and even though it's January, the wind is very calm. My name is.... Mar?a Jos? L?pez G?mez Urkiola, but we drop L?pez, because my mother says it's too much. I'm not especially beautiful, but I like myself because I have a modern face. I get told a lot of things by people.... Baby, you are more beautiful than Giralda of Seville. Giralda is not as beautiful as you. ....but my father gets mad, and says I am too conceited. Daughter, you are too conceited! The worst thing is mother agrees with him. Your father is right. They get on really well, but every now and then, the same old problems arise.... ....aha.... You seem in good spirits. I'm anxious.... ....I'd better shut up! What's the matter? You dare to ask me? Who is Purita? Purita? Which one, there are many. Too many! But it's all over soon.... You seem in good spirits. Your father is going to take me dancing. He's a naughty boy! I haven't told you about Pili yet. We are cousins. Her parents died in the civil war. She's lived with us since I remember. She's more than a sister to me. Pili gets more attention than me, but I'm cuter, and we're the same age. We are eighteen years old. She loves all those things.... ....but I prefer my princes. 'Sweet prince, with blond hair, handsome charmer, as you shine, even the stars are envious, I'm easily deceived, by those eyes so beautiful.' What the hell are you reading now? 'Nameless Poems.' They can't be that good, if they don't even have names. Why don't you study more, instead of listening to these noises? Getting funny? Why don't you study more instead of reading that trash? We are both in the same boat, in our first year of Philosophy, Latin, History of Philosophy and Arabic. That's our prison. Now, it only remains for me to introduce my cousin, Mariano. Cousin Mariano is an everyday guy, vulgar and boring. He's always getting into trouble, but he usually exagerrates his stories. Hello Mariano! Thank God I've found you. What's up? I think I'm going to slit my wrists. Why? Shush! The trees are listening! Come on, speak! It's Carter's people. Who is he? The Sicilian. The one from the halls of residence? As if, the halls of residence! It's all covert, he's a professional card-player. I'm in pain. I don't even want to think about it. They got me drunk, forced me to play, I lost everything, I was forced to sign a bond. The payment deadline is tonight, they'll kill me like jackals! Really? He seemed quite humble to me, even nice. Of course, their sort always seem like that. You have to help me. Is it money? How much? Five hundred. Bloody cards, why did I do that? I don't have that much. I can give you.... ....three hundred. You are an angel, my gaurdian angel. Sometimes, his gaurdian angel is Pili. The Hittites, cha, cha, cha! The Hittites, cha! The Hittites, and so like gods, will take the militant people of Asia Minor! Are you alone? No, I'm with Gary Cooper. This Gary, this is Mariano. Don't mock me. What's wrong? I think I'm going to slit my wrists. Did you know Coturne? Who? The Greek. She seemed like an angel, but now she's destroyed my life. What's she done? You are still too young to know.... Oh, I understand. Cigarette? Yes! It's been months since I last smoked. That little creature takes all my things. Who? The fruit of our hopeless love. That mean woman.... ....abandoned our little creature. How old? Twenty eight, maybe older. The baby? No, that's the mother. The baby is just a few months old. I've given it everything I have, now I'm ruined. The baby open its little arms whilst saying, 'Father, father, I am starving!' It speaks so well after just a couple of months? The baby is really clever, besides, I didn't say just how many months old. It's about fifty months old. You have to help. I need money to buy some powdered milk. How much? Five hundred. It's alright, I give you it. Thankyou. You are my gaurdian angel. ....but I'm digressing from the main story, Christmas holidays were coming closer, we were hoping to have a good time that year. Mother set up the tree and we did the nativity, even though we were too old for this. The whole drama began one day, just after one of the typical discussions, between my parents. You seem in good spirits. Yes I am. Why? Your father is taking me to Paris for the holidays. 'Oh Paris, Paris, Paris! The Moulin Rouge!' That naughty boy. He knows my weaknesses. (Gibberish) ....Vel?zquez....Vel?zquez.... He's a rat. He says he'll give us a lot of money. It doesn't matter. We'll be waiting for nothing. We can organise masquerades. Bah, that's just a one-day event. I mean many masquerades. After three days we'll get sick of dressing up. We can get boyfriends. I'd prefer the masquerades. Beltr?n is alright. He's handsome. -Handsome? He has a monobrow. He is elegant. His voice is high-pitched, besides, he likes that thing, Piluca. You are divine! I knew that already. I like Castro best. He's interesting. You don't know anything about living in this hell! Yes, he's very cheery. He looks like Kirk Douglas. He's even more vulgar than cousin Mariano. He likes Piluka as well. If I wasn't so troubled, I would love you. I knew that already. Meanwhile for us, the teacher was talking nonsense. (Oriental gibberish) Four aces, you owe me you a duro. I only see three! No, four! Pay more attention. It was a nine. The shaker cast a shadow over the dice, that's why it looked like a nine, I swear on my son! You owe me two duros. What you staring at? Let's keep playing. What's wrong? We have a problem. We'd rather not. About what? About this Christmas. Mum and dad are going to Paris. Do you have any money? Yes. It's alright then. A trip. That's crazy.... ....actually, it's not a bad idea. If they are travelling, then we can do it too. We can catch a plane. No planes! A trip, where to? To.... the south, in winter you have to go south. Where exactly in the south? Nowhere exactly, have a tour! On foot I suppose? You need to have faith in cousin Mariano. See! Five aces! I've bought this car, it's just sat there, I'll sell it to you cheap, it's comfortable, safe and perfect for a trip like this. -There you are! Beautiful isn't it? Beautiful! You mean that one? Does it have to be towed? It's no cadillac, but for this price you won't get better, not even a scooter. It's very spacious, durable, it's no mean car! It's open top means lots of fresh air, good for your health. The best car! Very maneuverable. See, the hood is perfectly secure. At the same time, it opens easily. Come closer. Come over, have a look. Plugs and cables, in perfect condition, I don't know what that bit is for, not to mention the cylinders.... What about the cylinders? ....I said don't mention them. The method of starting this car, is not electrical and dangerous, you just need to use the crank shaft! Just a few rotations. At the beginning, it's more than just a few, then it's warmed up. What's up? What's happening? What ignorance! It's the internal combustion! Internal combustion! The more it explodes the better! It's not like the cars getting made today, they just splutter.... ....then you have.... ....no, with this you have.... Come on, quickly! Yes! Yes! We're coming. It explodes beautifully. The steering wheel is ample, no catches. How do you get moving? It's very simple, release the handbrake.... ....my goodness.... ....once released, just tuck it away. It has two gears. Pull the stick up to go forward, and push it down to reverse. Modern cars are too complicated. Listen, 'boom, boom!' Beautiful explosions aren't they? We've got a problem, I can't drive. I will teach you! It won't be too expensive, just forty duros a day for you. Hold on, hold on just a minute, how much is the car? It's difficult to work out on the spot, I think I'm crazy to be this generous. Why don't you just rent us the car? Cars like this are delicate, you wouldn't know how to look after it. You would return it to me in bad condition, it's better to sell it to you whole. But how much is it? When it was produced, it cost one hundred thousand.... ....of what? Reales. I see. I can reduce it for you, one real per year. Huh. How many miles has it gone? All of them. Okay! Thanks to this car, I'm ruined! Okay, five thousand pesetas. Alright, alright, but the wheels are not included. Deal? Incredibly enough, the car drove.... ....not very fast, but it drove, and Pili decided to learn to drive. Don't be afraid to put your foot down. The explosions are as awesome as ever! A bit to the right, I suggest you try to avoid the trees ahead. More to the right. To the left, more to the right! More! More! Careful! Good, but slow down. Keep straight. Straight.... straight! What do you mean? Straight please! The bandage cost three hundred, the cream, one hundred, gauze, one hundred and fifty, and so the total is.... Yes, but when will the car be ready? The day after tomorrow. How much will the repairs be? Adding everything up, the repairs to the car and to myself, eight thousand. We can say goodbye to our trip. We've ruined everything. Let's not give up so easily. Why not go? Remember, we have to pay for hotels, restaurants.... What are you talking about hotels and restaurants for? What kind of a rubbish trip are you planning? What else can we do? The main point of a trip like this, is adventure, free spirit, how much is left? About five thousand pesetas. Well, not much, but we can make do. First of all you need a tent, I am willing to make another sacrifice, and sell mine. A good idea, but there's no need, uncle Alberto will lend us his. No, I know his tent, it's no good. Why? It doesn't have two doors, does it? But it does! That's why it's no use. In winter, no matter how far south you go, Aliseos will follow. Who? It's a wind which blows in two directions, so if you have two doors, you will catch pneumonia for sure. Alright, what about food? I have cooking things, it's difficult for me to part with them, but I'll make yet another sacrifice. Frying pan, skimmer, casserole dish, and a small one, three plastic cups, folding forks and spoons, and my trusty gas lighter. I can do you a package deal. All included are- gas lamp, bread scraper, a cloth for filtering, a cage, in case you hunt birds, and a water pistol, so as not to kill them, you can keep them in the cage, a trap with cheese, a watering can.... What for? ....to water things of course, two maps, one of the world, the other of Andaluc?a.... I'm not sure about the world one.... What if you felt like continuing your travels? If you've enough money, I can even get you an owl. A what? An owl. Alive? Sure, you cannot travel without an owl. What do we need it for? I'm not sure that deserves a reply. An owl is incredibly useful in a trip like this. It keeps wolves away, it eats insects, it keeps a look out for danger while you sleep, shhhh! And what about a parrot, they are very cute. A parrot? You must be crazy, they are very careless talkers! Thinking about it, it's not a bad idea, but it will be more expensive. Can it speak well? No, it's still very young, all it says is 'papa', 'mamma,' 'baby be good.' But it is gorgeous! Deal, no? Lastly, two bottles of champaign! What for? I don't know, how would you manage without me? One for Christmas and the other for New Years Eve. What's in the suitcases? Blankets and such like. You're crazy, luggage needs to be kept minimal. And what about all that? Is it necessary? Absolutely necessary. Look at the little bird! What a cute parrot. It's very beautiful, look at its massive eyes. It's weird looking. It's a new breed, Japanese, but nearly Chinese. It looks so sad, 'Hello parrot!' 'Hello parrot!' It's still a bit shy. Keep your voices down. He's had a headache these past few days. Excuse me. The maps are in the bag, they're a bit out of date, so it's wise to ask people. Now, pay me. We had just a little bit of money left, but he told us that Andaluc?a was very cheap, and that with two thousand pesetas, we'd easily get us through two weeks. He gave us both a goodbye kiss, and said.... Come on now, hurry up! Come on. You look very cute. Be sensible. Don't swim in dirty water. and, don't go too fast in the car. If you make a good pace, I think you'll get to Ja?n in two days. Safe journey! Please send me letters, or even better, things! Presents! Things were not actually as dangerous as he said. The first five hours were wonderful, even when we went uphill. We couldn't say the car was comfortable, especially for me, with Pili spending her days asleep. But, thank God, we were very close to Andaluc?a, already. It was a cold day, but anyway, we sat down to lunch, and our noses soon became red. We were ecstatic, letting our imaginations run wild. This place must be crowded with bandits. Why? You can feel it. -It's a very good spot, for a bandit to attack stagecoaches. 'Hold it! You, banker, give me your wallet!' Then, they will try to get my necklace.... ....but after looking me in the eye, they would say, 'I'm so sorry, you beautiful creature....' Get over yourself! I'm sure bandits are as vulgar as cousin Mariano, they would take your necklace without a care. Don't be so harsh. That's better. Pass me the chorizo. Thankfully, there were many signs on the road.... 'Hunting Ground' ....except for one place, the cross roads. In such cases, we asked people. Excuse me, please can you direct us to Ja?n? As a last resort, we checked the map from cousin Mariano. Is everything alright here, darlings? Hello. This piece of junk is not working. Let me see, have you checked the coil is not punctured, or if the batteries are alright? This model doesn't have Berco anymore! Anyway, I'd like to check the gasoline pump, that it's working. So, are you an expert? A little bit, a little bit! I see it now! What's wrong with it? Some screws have become loose, those ones. Ah, the screws. I'll call the garage, and tell them what needs to be done. Goodbye, my darlings! Goodbye! -That's what I've written so far, what do you think? Pah.... ....pah! I am sorry, Cervantes. Alright, the writing is fine, but it's everything else. There are some dodgy bits, it seems you are the one doing all the work, and I'm just a useless idiot. Besides that, it lacks structure, and most of what you say is just porkies, especially that bit about the 'nice old lady.' I couldn't stand her. That old hag was a nightmare. Back off, you useless things! I'll fix it myself! Hammer, hammer! Plyers! The problem came from the horn. Thunder and lightening! Rain from the underworld! Red devil! Lightening! You have cut out everthing that you didn't like, no, no way! You can write your own book, this is my book, and I will write it my way! -Can I enter? Good night! Good morning madam. Hello, Odon. A glass of red wine and stuffed olives. Very well. What an unpleasant mark has been left on me, the poor landscape of Andaluc?a.... ....but, it has to be said, the sunrises there have something special, it cannot be found anywhere else. So, everything there was beautiful, except that I was in a very bad mood. I had every reason to be. The car was a nightmare.... ....both when it worked.... ....and when it stopped. There was a gas-leak. When we came to a corner, it wouldn't budge. When we came to a blind summit, we just stopped. Then, poor Pili, had to walk to the nearest town, to get some gas.... ....but they were often not as close as we should like. The journey was well worth it. -Very beautiful. Well, same old problems. Do you speak English? Yes, very well indeed. I speak a little bit, but prefer Spanish. Is everything alright? The car won't go! I will fix it right away. No thanks. Let him try. Alright. Please yourself, I couldn't care less. It's nothing. Very simple! Till next time, thanks for the cadillac! Are your feet hurt? No, no, no, no! Look! Regards to your family! No way, no! Not this! No way! We'd better get the train to Madrid. No way, I'm not doing that. What a rubbish day, turning out like this. Well, we don't have anything left to get stolen. So what should we do now? I've no idea. Actually, now I know just what to do! Come on, follow me! This was the nicest part of the trip. I really liked the river at this time, going through Seville, in the middle of December, it really stirs you. I think I'm in love. With whom? Beltr?n. Why? He's on my mind right now.... Pah! In such cases you'd resort to anyone, no better than cousin Mariano. We were left in Sanl?car de Barrameda, close to the mouth of Guadalquivir river. In that place, our sorrows returned. What should we do now? I have no idea, it's up to you. Shall we return to Madrid? Is that your best shot? I think it's difficult, with only two hundred and thirty pesetas and fifty cents left. But.... That looks like our parrot. Yes. Actually, it is our parrot. Ah! Huh? Thanks, little parrot. Get in quick! The door. What? You'll have to open the door. Don't run so noisily. Alright. -Hey! What are you doing? Nothing. Who owns this car? My husband, do you like it? Ah, yes, it's very beautiful. Are you foreigners? Oh yes, we be total foreigners! It be for sale? Do you have dollars? Oh yes, us got many dollars! Then it be for sale! How many you want? Not be too cheap. It belong in museum. How be one thousand dollars? What's that in pesetas? It be fifty thousand. Ah, that's alright. Your husband be at home? No, my husband is in C?rdoba. He buy cars there, then sell here. Buys them? Eh? Can we get try of this? Yes, it go well. It be beautiful! It be stupendous! Can we now go, eh? Eh, yes, you can now start. Goodbye! Eh?! Not go! Help, thieves! Thieves! They have stolen my car! Out! Stand still, stupid girls. -Who owns that car? It's ours, why? Get moving. Who.... You have to get me to the border, come on! ....who are you? If you complain, I'll cut your throat. Get moving, come on! Okay.... Get in the back seat you trash, come on! Come on! What an animal. What are you looking at? That bag. You'd better forget it quickly. Let's go. I'll soon be in Lisbon. I've got away from all these fools. What are looking at me like that for? I'm not that ugly am I? Get off me. In other circumstances I'd.... ....but now I don't care about anything, you brat. We're getting closer. I don't mind you knowing the truth. I've robbed a bank. They caught me, but I escaped from jail. They couldn't lay their fingers on the cash, because I kept quiet. So, there you have it. Why did you do that? Are you really so proud? Yes. I've made fools of them all, now I'll live like a Raj. Stop. I said stop! What's she doing? Hold it! You'll end up looking like blotting paper, besides, it's not worth the effort. What you've just written is only good for one thing, lighting fires. At least my stories are more realistic. Maybe, but that's why they're more stupid.... ....you have to daydream more. Come on girls, the boys have just arrived! ....and then the parrot says, I only smoke little cigars! Tell me about it! -Do you know the one about the illustrious birds? -Tell us! -It's about a bird, which is illustrious, with good reason. He sits down.... Hello, how's it going? Hello. -....and then the bird says, cheekily, 'I am an illustrious bird!' Do you know the one about the mean geese? What's the matter? That's life.... ....if I told you.... Tell me. It's all about money, I need five hundred. What's wrong? You have no right to be unhappy! Your life is great! But you are shameless, even more vulgar than cousin Mariano, chasing after Piluca. Me? Her face is beautiful, but there's nothing else. So, you're not interested in her? Not in anyone.... ....but I have something to confess.... ....you are the person who disgusts me the least! Masked, masked, who am I? Who else? Shall we dance? Please! Don't you want to bring back the memories? Of what? I don't know, whatever. Do you know the one about the kind-hearted parrot? Oh, is it you? I think so. Leave me alone. Are you jealous? No. Yes. What if I tell you.... What? ....I love you. Do you know the one about the melancholic chick? It's about a melancholic chick.... You look gorgeous, like a queen. You know what? I've missed you a lot throughout my trip. I can believe it. I've thought of you a lot these days. Don't be false. Don't kid yourself. -Can you turn it on? Don't you realise we're in the dark? I don't like us to see ourselves drunk. Why don't you go to bed? Drunkards never go to bed, besides, I'm at work just now. The Cava, has gone straight to your head.... No wine left.... Listen, why don't we keep working now? Nonesense.... Listen, what you talking about? The book, silly, I'm inspired, on fire! So am I. Alright, we'll do it together, that way we won't argue. A good idea. You can do the writing. Just a little bit, then it's your turn. Alright. What should we work on? The bit about New Years Eve, in the castle! 'It was snowing.... ....it wasn't snowing.... I don't care about anything anymore. Me neither, even if we spend New Years Eve in the middle of nowhere, in the snow. I will like it like this. Hey, ladies! What are you doing there? We've had an accident. You can't spend the night there, come to my house, it's very close to here. I don't have a good feeling about this. Why? He seems like a decent man? It would be a pleasure, thankyou. What are you doing? I'm bringing the pistol. But it's only a water pistol? It's still a pistol, it'll do the job. Come on, climb up my girls! Happy New Year. Do you live here on your own? Yes! Yes. For a long time? Indeed, a long time. Don't you see anybody? I don't like people. Then why have you invited us? Because.... ....because.... ....because you.... ....remind me of her! What.... what's the matter? Nothing. Leave him alone. What nice memories. I'd like to tell you, an old, boring story. Your own story? No. It's a story about an unfortunate man. A murderer. Are you easily frightened? Normally. Eh, yes. Then.... ....listen to this.... ....we will have to go back, a long, long time, and to another country, Scotland. A baby was just born, the first and only child, of Lord and Lady Marian. When he was born, fate's finger chose him to become a criminal. It's a boy, Milady. Very soon he became a heavy burden for the family. 'He congratulated me, for my heroic actions, in Crimea....' Die, you scoundrel! Oh, what a fright. For the last time, I don't like these games. Urgh, why are you crying my baby? You silly old man! Drop dead! The child decided to change his tactics. Grandpa, grandpa! What do you want, my angel? Please tell me a story. Let me think, let me think. What kind of story do you want? A fairy tale. A fairy tale, alright, alright. Listen to this. It was.... ....a long, long time ago. There was a fairy godmother, who, with her magic wand, could transform things.... That was his first triumph. When he grew up, he became an antisocial youg man, lonely. He spent his days locked in his room. Who's there?! Do you want your dinner now, sir? No, I don't want it! Leave me alone, leave me alone! Away! Every time the full moon shone in the sky, a strange feeling came over him. An early morning, after a sleepless night, he saw her for the first time. That beautiful creature, made him feel for the first time, a new and wonderful feeling. She became his obsession. Soon he learned, her name was Polly Paterson, a singer from Soho. One night he made up his mind.... These flowers are for you Polly. Thankyou. Everything has changed now. You are beautiful. I love you. I feel happy, full of life, look.... Marianito, Marianito, Marianito, I didn't intend to talk to you about this, but.... ....I'm in a tight spot. What's the matter? My tailor... ....I owe him some money, which I don't have. Don't worry about that. How much? Five hundred. Eh? If that's all then don't worry. Then he gave her many hats, champaign, and the most outragious presents, and so this went on until his parents.... ....just stopped it, and sweet Polly left him. 'The moon, that falls on the oasis. The moon, that made me dream. I listen, to that song of love, making my melody. I listen, to that song of love, making my melody.' Good evening madam. Hello Charlie! How are you? Yes, I'm fine. Goodbye! Goodbye Polly! Goodbye. What are do doing here, what do you want? You can't speak to me like that, I love you, don't leave. Oh really, why not? You're a little child, I'm not interested any more. Why, what did I do wrong? I can't waste my precious time with little boys. That's not what you told me a few days ago. Do you want me to speak honestly? A few days ago, I didn't know you were dependant on your folks, on your folks' money. So this is it? Dog. What is the matter? Are you crazy? Get off! The lord to be, faded into the night.... 'Horrible drama in Soho!' 'A dancer murdered!' 'Lord Marian's son wanted!' For more than fifty years, nobody heard from him, but one full moon night, in a corner of Tripoli.... This news shook the world, and then it was forgotten.... ....until after another fifty years, in a far corner of Ontario.... How. White Blossom be here. White Blossom feel now that sky be more blue. On the prairies, there be many bison, when white man is here. The next day, the news was released, but the 'White Man faded away.' After fifty years, it was a black woman in Senegal, who next heard from the troubled Lord. The fatal news echoed from trunk to trunk, all over Senegal. It was said that the Lord, had met his end in the swamp.... ....but it was not to be.... ....since after fifteen years, sorry.... ....I mean fifty years.... ....in the Latin quarter of New York.... Please, 'Full Moon.' 'The moon, that falls on the oasis.' Goodbye, goodbye, see you another time. Goodbye, goodbye. Why are you here? Don't be afraid, it's only me. We have a lot of things to discuss. You know, for many centuries, sinister things.... I know who you are, I've seen your picture in the papers, you are a murderer! No. I know better. No, no. This is my chlorine, it's always at hand. If you come any closer, I'll throw it! What, what happened to the murderer? He had horrible burns, that mutilated his face. He retired to a life of solitude to keep his secret. He rented a villa in Spain. Around Sierra Nevada? Yes! You're about to see, what happened to the girl who did this to me. You are next! Ah, it's alright but.... What? ....that you're actually here, and not dead. Of course not, but the other bit wasn't true either. That old man was just a drunkard, but a nice enough person. He didn't do anything bad. Then we shoud rip it to shreds. You can't break it, it's a piece of literature, something created by both of us. Alright, go ahead. Very well. Half for you, half for me. ....Picasso.... -....Picasso.... -....Picasso....Picasso.... Goya! You girl! Do you agree? No. Eh, no! It's alright, give your reasons. Why? You don't think that Goya is the forerunner of impressionism, that's fair enough, providing you give good reasons. The themes are what's important, not the influences in technique. The important thing is what? The themes. The most important thing in Goya's work is mathematics. We pass through a lot of trash in life, to end up in a cold grave. Hello Mariano. Hello. How are you? How is life treating you? Bad. I need to have a word with you.... You can speak freely in front of him, we are together. I am on the brink of stabbing myself in the heart. Do you feel the anguish of living as well? Yes! Look, I did this. Then if you think you are brave enough, do it. This awful life is not worth it. Look again. Do you really approve of this? I congratulate you. Can you lend me some money to buy a dagger? Will it cost five hundred by any chance? The prices have risen, even a dagger this short, will not be enough to kill, it's already more than five hundred. I just have one hundred, make do with a little knife. You are an angel. Mariano. What's your game? I'm here waiting for you, and you're kissing another woman. Don't worry, she's just my cousin. I'm between my cousins. Let's go right now, or I'll get another boyfriend. To the cinema. To the cinema. Alright, see you later. I mean, in the next life. Come on. They belong together. Listen, are you laughing? Indeed, this awful life sometimes becomes funny. What do you think of it? Is this it? Yes, these are our impressions of the trip. I found them disappointing. When you left for your trip, you were just a cute girl, but when you returned I noticed a change, you became a woman. This stuff you've just shown me, does not reflect this change. Was that all that happened? I don't know, just as much is fantasy. Why? Because Pili and I always do this, transform things with our imagination. We all do it when we are children. Sometimes real life is very sad. I know what you mean, that's why we chose to forget them. The day you start accepting this you will become a woman. Then I am already a woman. Something happened on our trip.... ....that story about the mugging.... It's not true is it? ....no. It was different, I was no heroin, neither was he... What? It was horrible, I want to forget all about it. What if I was to ask you, to tell me all about it? That you tell me the truth? Maybe it will be better that way. It was towards the end, the fifth of January, we were in Coto de Do?ana, we didn't have any money left, we decided to return to Madrid. At sunset, we stopped at a place, less gloomy. Shall we sleep here? It seems peaceful enough. We must be close to the sea. I am starving. What can we have for dinner? We have a can of oil in the car. Is that all that your friend the artist has left us? No. We have some bolts, a mortar and a bottle of champaign.... Alright, that's not so bad. Don't be so rough. I'm sorry your highness. I've dreamt, about an awesome present from the three wise men, a television set. When you turned it on, there was New York, a show with Elvis Presley. 'Rock and Roll!' Maybe we have some presents here. Pilli, come here! What's up? I think we have been given a present. Do you think he's dead? I've no idea. He's alive. Bring the bottle of champaign. Come on, hurry up. Stand still. Who are you? We are.... ...we are....I am Mar?a Jos?, and this is my cousin. What are you doing here? We lost our way, we don't really know where we are. Is that your car? Eh, yes. Then let's go. You have to give me a ride. Whatever you want. Wherever you want to go. Come on! Run, quick! What are you waiting for? No, we can't do this. He's a human being. He's probably just a scoundrel but if we leave him here.... ....if we leave him, we'd be no better than him. Who do you think he is? Our present from the wisemen, come on. Oh, I'm starving, do you know all we've eaten today? One 'churro' each. -Listen, why don't you go to hunt something. I've never hunted in my life. There's a first time for everything. Well, I think I will hunt for my feet. See you later. How are you feeling? Much better, thanks. What's today's date? The 6th of January. Have I been here for long? Since this morning. I'm so sorry, I was out of my mind. What are you doing here? What are you afraid of? It's better for you not to know. Alright, but just one other thing, what are you doing next? I am in your hands, I cannot move. Last time I had something to eat was four days ago. Who's firing? Don't worry, it's just our lunch on its way. Where's my gun? You've just heard it, you'll have it back in no time. I lost my way, I was hunting and I lost my way, but I need to go back, right away. I don't think so, we have no idea where we are. Where do you want to go? To the frontier. Please don't ask any more. Hello, did you get anything? I don't know if it's a duck, a bird or a what? What the hell is this called? I don't know. I don't mind, it was delicious. Maybe just because we were starving? Now listen to me, I need you. I have to get to the frontier today, Why? I promise you won't be troubled, but I must get there today, that's it. How will we get there? I have an idea. We have to head northwest. I think it'll just take a couple of hours. What've you got there? Don't ask any more! I apologise. It's not your fault. It's in that direction. Come on quick. What are we going to do next? We're going astray, and we've no money left. Yes, thanks to the 'wise men.' They've been great. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Shut up. -A prisoner has escaped from El Puerto prison, then he robbed a bank in Seville. Stop! Are you happy now? Now you know everything. Very clever aren't you? Yes, it's me, Luis Fern?ndez Castro, thirty seven, married, thief, robber, escapee. Now if you don't want a hard time, get on to the frontier. Come on! I'm going now. You can rest your minds now, accept my apologies, and go away. Hey, listen! Why don't you wait until nightfall? I can't wait.... ....but.... ....do you really want to help me? I'm not sure. I feel sorry for you. Thanks. It's the first time in five years.... ....that anyone has felt compassion for me. Why don't you turn yourself in? I can't do that now, I had a chance to change way back at the beginning, but it was very difficult then. I was just a child during the war, our war. I lived in a horrible place full of bombs, death and desolation. While still a child I got used to violence, gun shots, and death. When the bombing stopped, I used to play among the debris, with other kids. Sometimes, we even tripped over corpses. First time it happened I shouted.... ....but then I found it natural. We looted the bombed out houses, we were hungry. My parents.... ....I have hardly any memories of them.... ....my monther ran off with a stranger.... ....then my father didn't stay around. When everything was over, I was already a grown lad, with no spirit, or faith in anything. There was a square in that city, with a bell tower, and a toy shop.... ....then looting, even death itself became every day sights.... ....like that square, or the sound of those bells. I just wandered around, stealing at the first chance I got, anything, then I was caught. Everything was over. I kept wandering further into wilderness, and then jail. Now everytime I see a youngster, who studies or works like a good boy, I feel like crying with rage and I wonder, why I'm going through all this? Why couldn't I have been born ten years later, like them? I swear it, I'd love.... I'd love to change, but I can't. I deserve to live a good life. I can't turn myself in, I can't just waste my life inside a prison, seriously, without a day of happiness, without friendly people around, to say, 'Good-day, Luis, how are you doing?' I don't ask for more than that. If I've escaped from prison, and keep hiding out, it's because I have the hope of sitting in a chair under a tree, anywhere, seeing someone walking past, and saying, 'Good day, Luis, isn't the sun shining beautifully?' Then grow older peacefully. I'm not asking for love or friendship, the only thing I'm looking for, is some fresh air, and a chair to sit on. Can we help you in any way? Can you walk to that gate over there? From that spot you can tell me if the coast is clear. Yes. Pili! Pili! Come with me quickly! All clear. Come on. All clear. Thankyou. There's nobody in sight. Thankyou. Mar?a Jos?, come here! Look! Look! Look! Look! look! 'This is to show that the 'wise men' were generous after all.' -Halt! -Halt! -Who's there?! -Halt! -Halt! Now you see things differently, don't you? Yes, that's true. Now, you accept that I'm not an emperor and you're not an emperess? No, you are right. You can wait until I finish my degree, and until we find a flat, not a palace, and I've enough money to support us. Yes, I don't know what's happening to me, everything seems different. It's something wonderful, it also happened to me a short time ago. We are not children any more, we are beginning to understand the world. You are nearly nineteen, nearly a woman. Shall we throw it away? Yes. It's just a silly thing, kid's stuff.... Translation and subtitles by Jorge Casas L?pez and Stuart Lindsay, October 2011.
