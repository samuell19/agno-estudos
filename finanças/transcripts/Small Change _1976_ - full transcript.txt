HERE, THE CENTRE OF FRANCE "My dear Raoul, I am travelling with my father and we have stopped at Bruère-Allichamps, in the exact centre of France." "I'm going to a summer camp for the first time. And you?" "I hope it will be a mixed camp." "With kisses from your cousin, Martine." The soil is granitic and impermeable. Streams, rivers and lakes... irrigate the whole area. Raoul Briquet, you are not writing anything down. Bring me that card. I know, it's Bruère-Allichamps! Come here. All right, let me explain. It's a small town, or rather a village, located at the exact centre of France. So they built a small monument, which is on the postcard. See? Can you see at the back? This is funny. May I? I would like them all to see it. This is the way the card is addressed. It says: Raoul Briquet... HLM Béranger... Thiers... Puy-de-Dôme, France... Europe... Universe. Has anyone here been to Bruère-Allichamps? Laurent Riffle, come and explain. Raoul, you may sit down. All right, tell us why you went to Bruère-Allichamps. My father is a hairdresser, and they held a meeting there. - A hairdresser's convention. - They ate all afternoon. I got bored, so I went for a walk in the park. Who else? Mathieu. Tell me what it's like there. I've never been there, sir. Then why did you raise your hand? Because you wrote "Thiers, Puy-de-Dôme" on the blackboard, instead of using the postcode: Thiers, 63300. So, you know your postcodes. Remain seated. - What's the matter? - You forgot to leave the keys. The movers are waiting. They can't get the furniture in. - Here. - Thanks. See you tonight. Put me back in jail. Make me sit up on a nail. Eat your hat. Spill my guts out on a cat. Kill my belly button. Kiss my ass. The Miser by Molière. Late again, Fougerie? Harpagon's declamation. Act IV, scene 7, up to line 15. - Desmouceaux, recite it for us. - I didn't learn it. What do you mean? Come here. - I didn't learn it. - I assigned it, didn't I? Yes, Miss. - You all learnt it? - Yes, Miss. - Well? - I don't even have the text. Here. You've got five minutes. Listen to the others, then I'll get back to you. Privadier, tell us the text. Stop thief! Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven! I'm done for! I've been killed! They've taken my money! Sit down. Froment, you try. I don't know the rest. - How far did you get? - I don't know. - You began... - I studied up to "Where's he gone to?" Is that all? I told you to go up to line 15: "I'm dead and buried." I'm not at all pleased. Fayet, you try it. Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven! I'm done for! I've been killed! They've taken my money! - Who could have done it? - You can sit down. It's quite the same. Try to give it more feeling and don't speak so fast. Hurbagnac, your turn. Stop thief! Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven! I'm done for! I've been killed! They've taken my money! (teacher) Not bad, but try with more spirit. Because poor Harpagon is really frantic. - Jallat Christophe, please. - Stop thief! Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven! - I've been... - (teacher) I'm done for! What are you doing here, boy? You're not one of ours. How did you get here? By car? Don't tell me it's a helicopter that dropped you in the school yard. Are you deaf or are you dumb? It's a note from the town hall. They're sending us new kids in mid-June? Let's see the headmaster. He's not in. Are you sure they didn't give you any other papers? We'll ask Mr Richet. Who could have done it? Where's he gone to? Where's he now? Where's he hiding? What'll I do to find him? Desmouceaux, do you know it now? Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven! I'm done for! I've been killed! They've cut my throat! They've taken my money! Not bad for five minutes' work. Still, if you had studied it yesterday, you'd know all of it. Fine. Sit down. Brouillard, your turn. Stop thief! Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven! I'm done for! I've been killed! Stop. You know the text, but don't seem to understand what you're saying. It's all in the same tone of voice. Listen to me. Stop thief! Stop thief! Murderers! Assassins! Justice, merciful heaven! I'm done for! I've been killed! They've taken my money! - Do you understand? Try again. - (monotone) Stop thief! Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven... I'm as stubborn as you are! I don't care how long it takes. But you'll say it properly this time. Start again. (monotone) Stop thief! Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice... (knock at door) Sit down. Excuse me, Miss Petit. This is Julien Leclou. He's new, but he belongs to your age group. Look, there's an empty place. Go and sit over there. The head master would've told me. It must be a mistake. (male teacher) The caretaker brought him to me. - What shall we do? - Go ask the headmaster. - Where do you live? - The Mureaux. There aren't any houses there, just factories. Is that so? Well, I live there. Garrel, take over till I come back. Now, I'll show you the real Harpagon. Stop thief! Stop thief! Assassins! Murderers! Justice, merciful heaven! I've been killed! They've cut my throat! They've stolen my money. Who can have done it? Where's he gone to? Where's he now? Where is he hiding? What'll I do to find him? Which way shall I go? Or not go? Is he not here? Who's that? Stop! Villain, give me back my money! Oh, it's me! I'm losing my mind. I don't know where I am, who I am or what I am doing. Alas, my poor money, my poor money, my friend, they've taken you from me! And now you've gone, I've lost my prop, my comfort, my joy. That's a great performance! Do you teach them drama? I've got good students. It's about Julien Leclou. Put him in Miss Petit's class. What if he's not up to the same level? - What if he can't follow? - I don't know his level. I can only tell you in confidence that he was referred by welfare as a special case. - Hi, Dad. - Hello, Patrick. - I'll put the shopping away. - You forgot the list this morning. I remembered everything. One pound of sugar. One bottle of oil. - Bread, apples. - Open the window, please. Sure, Dad. I've read so much today that my eyes hurt. - What's your name? - Franck. - What about you? - Sylvie. Richard, can you take Gregory home for me? I've still got a few errands to do. Bye bye, Gregory. Go on. Bye, Gregory. That's a good boy. Bye! Bye, baby. Look, somebody's moving in. Oh, look, it's Mr Richet! Good morning, Mr Richet! Richard, what are you doing here? - I live in the flat by the lift. - So we're neighbours. It's the little Golfier boy who's in my class. - I must know your mother. - Is this your brother? No, I have to take him to the ninth floor. - Do you want to see the flat? - I'll show you the layout. You're big, so you'll understand. This is the kitchen. I forgot my books. - Your bike broken? - No, the chain slipped. - Do you have a TV? - Of course. - What was on last night? - An American series, Columbo. - What happened? - They sabotaged a racing car. A gangster sawed the rudder, and the car exploded. - Columbo sawed it? - No, the gangster. - And did Columbo get him? - He managed to get him. - You owe me some money. - How much? - Two francs. - I'll think about it. - You'd better give them back to me. - Cool it. It's only two lousy francs! - Well, I'd like to have them. - Sure. Me too. - How much do you get? - Two francs. - What do you do with it? - I buy sweets and go to the pool. Claudio thinks Sylvie was born in a rubbish bin. - I heard they found you in a rubbish bin. - It's not true. I was born in Toulon. - A rubbish bin in Toulon, then. - Was it a plastic bin? - I get five francs a week. - Not bad. What do you do with it? - I buy books. - How much do you get? - Nothing. - Do you spend it all? - I told you, I get nothing! - (school bell) - Did you forget anything? - No. Just go away. Let me take you to your classroom. - Go home. - Don't you want me to visit your school? - No, go home! - At least say goodbye. Do I get a kiss? Bye. Work hard. See you tonight. You OK, Patrick? The driver put an explosive in the petrol tank. Columbo guessed everything when he found the empty can in the lavatory. I think Columbo was tipped off. He got an anonymous phone call. No, you are way off. Columbo caught the mechanic cutting the rudder of the car. How beautiful! - I've never seen anything so beautiful! - What are you doing? - They're my father's binoculars. - Keep them at home. All right, then. What's wrong, Leclou? You're not playing with the others? OK, OK. We'll review the key dates of the 15th-18th centuries. - Falipou. 1572? - The St Bartholomew Massacre. - 1610? - Death of Henry IV. - 1648? - Treaty of Westphalia. Alsace becomes part of France. - Keraguel. 1685? - Louis XIV revokes the Edict of Nantes. - 1763? - Treaty of Paris. - We lose India and Canada. - Good. Leclou. Leclou! Sorry to wake you up. You look completely dazed. Do you know what that means? It means looking lost, like you look right now. All right. Someone else. Let's see... Jallat. 1492? - Columbus discovers America. - 1515? (whispering) - François I's victory at Marignan. - Right, but no whispering. Desmouceaux. 1685? Did you hear me? Desmouceaux, please stand up. This is where it's happening. Look at me. Do you understand? Look at me. Look over here. Are you deaf or something? Didn't you hear my question? (school bell - What's up? - I'm revising for tomorrow. What are you looking at? Nobody's home. I forgot my key. Help me to revise. Here goes. The metallurgical industry is a key factor in our economy, as it employs over a million workers. Its... - Its role. - Its role... its role... It's all crap. Forget it! - Julien! For God's sake! - Quick, get out of here. Are you taking the piss or what? Get in here right now. Come, we'll take the lift. Drat. It's broken down. We'll walk up to the top. Come. Why isn't the lift working? Come, sweetie. Come. Here, hold the bread. Let's climb upstairs. Come on, let's go up. We can take our time. (Gregory) It's hard to walk up. It's hard to walk up. Will you carry the bread for Mummy? My bags are heavy. Come on, baby. I'll take the bread. Yes, I will. Now, come on. You want to drag the bread along the floor? Let's go. Hurry up. I'll race you, quick. Quick, I'll catch you up with you. No, Gregory, don't go inside. No, no. Come back here. This is not our house. The bread goes boom. Come here. I'm sorry, the door was open and he came in. I know him. We met yesterday. He's already seen the flat. My husband says he's very bright. Maybe he'll be in his class one day. - Would you like to sit down? - I wouldn't mind. - Would you like a drink? - With pleasure, if I'm not disturbing you. - Some red wine? - Yes. - Are you doing all this work yourself? - My husband helps after school. So I left, and to make sure he wouldn't find me, I went to work down south. But you know what it's like there: sun, sun, and more sun! It got boring. And then I met a guy... ..four times, and we finally came here. I liked it here, but I guess he didn't. After three months, he fed me the classic line "I'm going out for some matches." And I never saw him again. But I've got my Gregory. But then, a fortnight ago... Please keep this to yourself. I know I can trust you. I spotted an ad in the personal column. "Bachelor seeking companionship." "Loves kids." Anyway, it could be interesting. - Have you met? - No, I wrote to him. He replied. We've agreed to meet on Sunday. We'll both be carrying the same newspaper. - To the stranger. - To the stranger. Gregory, what are you up to? Come here. Give Mummy the bread. Thank you, sweetie. I lost my wallet. - Did you see my wallet? - No. Are you sure you haven't seen it? You didn't hide it? Or lose it? Be a good boy. Kitty. Come, Kitty. (baby talk) Did you notice a wallet? - Did you lose it around here? - I don't know. What a shame. Come here, kitty. Come, kitty. (baby talk) Come here, kitty. Wait, kitty. Come here, kitty! Kitty gone. Kitty! Come here, kitty! Little kitty. Here I am. - I can't find my wallet. - Did you leave it here? No. I think I'd already lost it. I must've left it downstairs or at the grocery. (giggles) Kitty! Gregory, what did you do? Are you all right Gregory went boom! (woman) She fainted. Wake up, he's fine. Boom! Boom. Boom. Boom. Boom. What appals me is that no one did anything. What did you expect them to do? They were all looking at him with bated breath, but they were helpless. The incredible thing happened when he landed. We all rushed over, expecting the worst. But no. He got up, looked around, and started to laugh. You know what he said? "Gregory went boom!" - That's amazing. - Incredible. It's terrifying to think of the way kids are in danger from morning to night. That's not exactly true. If the same thing had happened to an adult, he'd have died. Kids are as solid as rock. They bump into everything, they stumble through life, but they have grace. And they're tough, too. ♪ Children are bored on Sundays ♪ On Sundays, children are bored ♪ In their knickerbockers or their Sunday best ♪ On Sundays, children are bored (boy) Let them sleep.

(newsreel music) (narrator) 13 years ago, during a springtime full of pain and distress, the arms of war were stilled over the land of Algeria. This new spring of work and serenity, proves that the virtue of time and the wisdom of men can get together to draw from the past the oath of a future freed from rancour and resentment. When memory gives imagination scope and thought exorcises the shadows, then this meeting might become an important moment in history. (orator) I am certain that in the world we live in, in our present position, and knowing each other as we do, the French and the Algerians have things to talk about, and the Algerians and the French have things to do together.

COMFORT ON THE RAILWAY Hello, young man. - Good morning, Mrs Riffle. - Hello, Fatima. Come, hurry. Forgetting something? Bye, honey. Now you work hard. - What a pair of eyes! - She's got a great ass! It's during my geography class. There are always two in the back playing with themselves under the table. It's an old school tradition. I think they do it to provoke me, because I'm a woman or something. Trust me, that has nothing to do with it. Mine do the same, but in my history class! - History! - I wonder if they're not having a contest. They sit together, to share books. I've seen that quite a lot. It's part of the process of growing up. I wonder if I should keep ignoring them or bring it out in the open. That's entirely up to you. I once almost had a bad problem. I had one boy, who was two years older than the rest, and who was a bit of an exhibitionist. I took him aside and we talked it over. After that he behaved. It's the same with girls. In my class in Lyons we had exactly the same problem. - You see? - Next year, when we take in girls... Then we'll have a completely new set of problems. When my brother-in-law's class went co-ed, the kids reverted back to childhood. They felt intimidated. There were other problems. Toto's mum sends him to buy a banana and two lemons. On the way home, there's a bridge. He drops the two lemons and the banana in the water. A nun comes by and says "What's wrong?" "I dropped my lemons and banana." "I'll get them back." Then a priest comes by. Toto tells him about the two lemons and the banana. So they both dive in, naked. After that, the nun grabs the priest's dick... and the priest grabs hold of the nun's two lemons. That's the end! Take your seats. Silence, please. Will you open your grammar books at page 94? - Leclou, where's your book? - I don't have it. - Did you leave it at home? - I don't know. I don't care. You don't care? Then go stand in the corridor!

This is a scandal! You call this a haircut? This is no way to talk to people. Now, calm down. Be civilised. I'm calm. What did you do to my son? I paid for his haircut. - Look at the result! - I won a gold medal four years ago. Would I butcher him like that? You'd better tell us the truth, child. I cut one side, you the other. My dad says it's best when no one can tell you've been to the barber. It won't look like you've been to the barber. Turn around. I can't see. That's my side! - Shut up! - Go to hell. - Don't over do it, guys. - All right. - Make it even on both sides. - Don't cut my ears. Turn your head. Now we're going to even it up. - Make both sides even. - All right. It's fine, we're doing it well. - Lay off my side! - It's my side! - It's mine. Stop. - Stop cutting on my side. - It's better now. - I apologise. But when I saw him... - I understand. - How much? I won't accept money. I did it for the honour of the profession. Goodbye. Good evening, children. - Did Mr Golfier calm down? - Yes, it's all worked out. He wanted to pay, but I refused. If you've finished your homework, I'd like to set the table. - Why not stay for dinner, Patrick? - My father's expecting me. - We could call him, right? - Good idea. (phone) - Mr Desmouceaux? This is Mrs Riffle. - Madame. Patrick just finished helping Laurent with his lesson. Can he stay for dinner? - Of course. It's very kind of you. - Good. - Good evening. - Good evening. Pass me your plate. Potatoes. Do you like carrots? - Not really. - You don't? A few greens. Some gravy. You can start, Patrick. - Thank you. - Would you like some more? Sure. Is that enough? Would you like some mustard? - Would you like some salad? - I'd like some more bread. I'd also like some Camembert. - Would you like some fruit? - A peach. And some grapes. Goodbye, and thank you very much for your frugal meal. (she laughs) - What is it? - I was thinking about our holidays. I would love to go to Venice this year. Hey, boy, you want to make five francs? You see the house over there? Go up to the third floor, on the left. Ring the bell, and if a lady opens the door, give her this note. - If it's a man? - Say it's the wrong floor. All right.

Two balcony tickets. - Are you sisters? - No. She lives across the street from me. - What class are you in? - Me? I'm quitting school to become a beautician. Our spotlight this week is on the one and only Oscar, who is currently a triumph at the European Theatre. Every night the Parisian elite jam his dressing room, as he whistles while he works. Oscar was born in 1945, right after the war. In 1944 Madeleine Doinel, a pretty 19-year-old Parisian, had gone, along with many others like her, to pay tribute to the US troops who chased the invaders out of our land. In this atmosphere of patriotic joy, Madeleine, Oscar's future mother, spent the night flirting with Peter Nicholson, a GI from Kentucky. Thousands of girls discovered the joy of chewing gum in the arms of the liberators. Madeleine Doinel's flirtation had an aftermath. Oscar was born nine months later, right after his parents' wedding. Her gown was white, although a little tight. They lived happily ever after, though she had great difficulty with English, and Peter never succeeded in learning French. How would this non-communication affect Oscar? Would his first words be in French or English? Or would his instincts lead him to speak Latin or Hebrew like his ancestors? The child's solution to this dilemma was really unexpected. (whistles) Unable to talk, he began to whistle. He didn't immediately become a virtuoso, but he knew how to let it be known that his soup was too salty. And if his calls were not answered fast enough, he was capable of violence. By trilling, he knew how to persuade little Marion that all his toys were really his. If not in wisdom, Oscar did grow in age. On his first communion, he refused to kiss his cousin. She was so mortified that she kept her veil and entered a convent. Now, in 1976, Oscar is 31. He still doesn't speak, but his handicap has won him fame and fortune. His motto: "The whistle is mightier than the word!" And now we take you to the Caribbean. Under the rising sun, a white boat is waiting in the Port of Curaçao, less than 40 miles from Venezuela. What idiots! See how spruce these factory girls are. How happy and conscientious they are. First they catch the fragile cups as they go past. One second too late and the whole assembly line should grind to a halt. But fortunately they are dextrous. Now, they carefully fill the cups to the top and put them into racks. As you can see, the supervisor checks each rack. A man they call "Uncle" just to tease him, because here it is like a big family. After rigorous selection at each step of the manufacturing process comes the careful packaging. The merchandise is sent by trolley to the wharf, where a colourful crowd gathers. But even the best things come to an end, these little black children seem to think, waving their little flags, as the governor's long white car appears on the horizon. The ship lowed like one of our Normandy cows. Listen to it calling out to the stragglers. Every ship takes a part of its country along with it. And the West Indies are no exception to the rule. It was a small part of France which brought us to this colourful paradise. Farewell, Caribbean. Farewell and good luck. (doorbell/knocking) It's my wife. She's having a baby. I've got to call the hospital. - The phone's here. - What's going on? - Lydie's in labour. Go help her. - I've only got the day number. - I'll get the phone book. - Hello? What are they up to? - A maternity hospital, and no answer! - I think it's this page. Hello? Yes, finally. I'm in the Jean Zay building. We need an ambulance. My wife's in labour. I'm counting on you. We'll be downstairs. They said three or four minutes. I'll call the lift. (baby cries) If you want pictures, it's now or never. So, what about the pictures? Hey, guys. (they whistle the multiplication tables) Silence! Mr Richet will be a little late this morning. Behave. Don't force me to come back again. - I know why he's not here. - Why? - His wife had a baby. - He took pictures of her during labour. - To sell them? - What a pig! - He's disgusting! - He took pictures of the baby. - So they weren't for sale! - Is it a boy or a girl? - It's a girl. - They're twins. You can't even tell whether it's a boy or a girl. - A boy! - A girl! Twins. Good morning. Sit down. As you can see, I'm a little late. It's a special day. I have a baby. - Is it a girl or a boy? - It's a boy. - What's his name? - His name is Thomas. Like a tomato. - How is your wife? - She's fine. She's tired, but very happy. - Has he got hair? - How big is he? - He's 20 inches long! - How wide is he? - I couldn't say. - Can we see him? - When he's older. - How much does he weigh? He weighs 7lb 7oz. Now. - I'm a very happy person today. - So are we! So, no jacket. And... We'll do the class together, because I didn't prepare anything. Today we will practise our oral skills. Richard Golfier. Please stand up. Tell us what you did on Sunday. I got up late, I slept a lot. - And then? - I slept a lot, I got up late. You don't seem interested in talking about your Sunday. - May I talk about motorcycles? - Sure, go ahead. We're listening. But speak loudly, so everyone can hear you. There are many different makes. Suzuki, Gus Kuhn, Triumph, BSA, BMW, Kawasaki, Peugeot. Remain seated. Mr Richet. I'll take care of this. I've just been told that the De Luca brothers gave out some toys to certain students. It was generous of them, but sadly, those little guns don't really belong to them. They bought them with money that wasn't really theirs. So, let's have them all back! A set of numbers. E equals zero, one, two, three, up to eight. Then what? A equals... - Good morning. - I would like to buy some flowers. - What kind? - I don't know. Is it a present? Then I suggest roses. See? Each colour is a symbol. RED ROSE: PASSIONATE LOVE I'll take the red roses. Ten more minutes, Mrs Golfier. - (clears his throat) - Good morning, Patrick. - Laurent just went out. - I came to see you. - Me? - Yes, I thought... I mean, they're for you. For me? How sweet! They're beautiful. I love them. Give my thanks to your dad. Some new mothers, trying too hard to do a good job, may press the infant so tightly against their breast that the baby can't breathe. As a result, the baby will resist the feeding, while the mother feels rejected and so no longer enjoys feeding him. An infant will sense his mother's anxieties. It's not just a question of comfort. His feelings will affect his future behaviour. He will relate to women the way he did with his mother. You must have had an odd relationship with your mother. - How old is he now? - He'll be two weeks old tomorrow. - It was a Sunday night, remember? - In the middle of the night. - Sometimes I think he's smiling at me. - Really? They don't really start smiling until they're two months old. - Even so, he smiled at me. - Maybe. - Do you leave him alone all the time? - No, I'm always with him. He's got nice ears. - He's got my finger. He won't let go. - All babies grab things and squeeze. - When will he grow bigger? - I don't know. Maybe tomorrow. You're just coming home now? Get out! I'll manage alone, as usual! What are you talking about? It says 1962. You're only 14. No, 16. I changed it to 1962 to get child discounts. See? The date's been altered. Sorry, go ask the other girls if they want to, but I don't. Leclou, what are you doing here? Did you sleep here? You're an hour early. Come in and wash up. And one could see, comma, by the light of the glowing embers, comma... - (knock on door) - Come in. The doctor's here for the annual medical checkup. Let's go, everybody. - Why are you still here? - My parents told me not to go. Did they give you a note to that effect? So you go, like everybody else. My parents signed up for Club Med. I'd rather go back to Arcachon. My cousin will be there. And this time I won't pass up the chance I had last year. Planning your holidays already? Where will you be going? - To summer camp, with boys and girls! - Oh, how nice. - You've got to strip off like us, Leclou. - Come on, get undressed. - What's going on? - Leclou won't undress. - The doctor needs some quiet. - This boy won't undress. Then bring him in now. Leclou! Sack of potatoes! Stand up straight. Four foot four. Take off your shirt. Please, close the door. - Help me find the headmaster. - We'll look for him. Mademoiselle! The headmaster was just here. He's next door now. Thank you. - Sir. - What's going on? - It's very important. - Let's go see. - What's going on? - It's very serious. We'll have to call the police. Here's the inspector. - Good morning. - Good morning. Meet Dr Lartigues. We were doing a routine checkup. One of the boys was reluctant to undress. His body is covered in bruises, scars, burn marks. - What did he have to say about that? - What abused kids always say. "I fell down, I ran into something." - Whose class is he in? - Julien Leclou is in Miss Petit's class. Didn't you notice anything? (sobs) Come on, protect these women, please. Turn your head the other way. You assholes! Get out of here! Go home! This is a private property! Get out! Go away, you bunch of hoodlums! My kid's happy, he goes to school. Right, Mum? He goes to school. No pictures! Get that mike outta here! Can you take my class today, Mr Richet? The police need to question me. Go on, I'll look after your pupils. I haven't been able to sleep. I keep thinking about it. I keep blaming myself because I hadn't noticed a thing. - I punished him quite a lot. - No, Chantal, don't feel guilty. Don't mix things up. Don't forget that he made a point of covering all this up. (car horn) Go on. You are too crowded over there. Move over by the window. I know you are all thinking about Julien Leclou. You've read the papers, and you've heard your parents talking about it. And now you're all about to go on holiday. And I'd like to talk to you about Julien, too. I don't know much more about it than you do, but I'll tell you how I feel. First, as far as I know, Julien will be taken care of by the welfare services. He will be placed in a family. Wherever he goes, he'll be better off than he was in his own home, where, to tell you the truth, he was regularly beaten. His mother will lose her rights, which means she can't look after him. Julien will be 15 or 16 before he knows the freedom to come and go as he wants. Julien's case is so tragic that we cannot help comparing our lives with his. My own childhood was difficult, though not as bad as Julien's. I couldn't wait to grow up, because I felt that adults had all the rights. They can lead their lives the way they want. An unhappy adult can start again from scratch. But an unhappy child is helpless. He feels unhappy, but he can't put a name to it. And deep inside himself he cannot even challenge his parents or any other adults who hurt him. An unloved and battered child feels guilty. That's what's so tragic! Of all mankind's injustices, child abuse is the most unjust, the most revolting, the most unbearable. The world isn't fair and never will be. But we can fight for more justice. We have to, we must! Things change, but not fast enough. All our politicians like to claim that they're impervious to threats, but it's just the opposite. They always give in to pressure! A show of strength is the only way to get results. Adults have understood that, and they get what they want through marches and protests. I'm telling you this because I want you to see that when adults are determined, they can improve their lot. But children's rights are forgotten. There isn't a single political party that really looks after kids like Julien or you. Do you know why? Because children can't vote! If kids had the right to vote, you could ask for more nurseries, for better care, for anything. And you'd get it, because the politicians would want your votes. You could come to school an hour later in winter, instead of rushing out before daylight. I also wanted to tell you that it is because my own childhood was unhappy, and because I don't like the way kids are treated, that I became a teacher. Life isn't easy. And it is important that you harden yourselves to face it. I don't mean hard-boiled. I'm talking of inner strength. Things tend to balance out, and those of us who had a difficult childhood are often better equipped for adult life than those who were overprotected, or had a lot of love. It's a kind of law of compensation. Life is hard, but it's wonderful - that's why we value it so much. When we're sick in bed with a cold, we can't wait to get out and enjoy life. We sometimes forget how much we really love it. You're about to go on holiday. You will discover new places and make new friends. When you come back, you'll move up a grade. Next year, the school will be co-ed. Time flies, and before long you'll have kids of your own. I hope you'll love them, and they'll love you. If they don't feel you love them, they'll transfer their love and affection to other people, or other things. That's the way life is. Each of us needs to love and be loved. Well, boys, school is over. Have a great holiday. ♪ Two miles of walking wears out, wears out ♪ Two miles of walking wears out one's shoes ♪ Two and a half miles of walking wears out, wears out ♪ Two and a half miles of walking wears out one's shoes... (singing continues) "Dear Cousin, it finally happened!" "On the train, on the way to camp, I noticed him immediately." "I could tell he liked me too." "His name's Patrick." "Yesterday they took us to the stadium to watch a bike race." "Naturally, I didn't concentrate on the race much, and neither did he." "At lunch time, we were in the canteen and I had to go the bathroom." Hold onto my apple for me. Don't eat it! I'll be right back. I've got to pee. Let's have some fun with Patrick. Hey, Patrick! - Me? - Yes. Have you seen Martine? - No. - She went outside to kiss you. (laughter) - Go! She's waiting for you. - So? What can I do about it? (cheering) (boy) Martine! - Did Patrick find you? - No. He went outside to kiss you. BOYS' DORMITORY GIRLS' DORMITORY "But then, when we went back into the canteen, what a racket!"
