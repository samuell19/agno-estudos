Hello Hi! I'm Elisabeth For the meetup group right? YES! Nice to meet you come on in. Such a lovely house Thank you. It's my mum's actually. She is out of town. Doesn't even know that I'm Oh darling don't be nervous it will be fine could you do you mind if I just pop to the loo? Of course sweetheart No problem I will just make myself comfortable How could you do such a thing you idiot? Oh, I didn't hear the door Sorry, did you.. Darling this is John He is a wonderful pianist I met him at one of my meetups, where we'd sing songs. I met him at one of my meetups, where we'd sing songs. Right? You two know each other from before? Hi. It's Can actually, it's a Turkish name No no no you can call me John I don't mind it Oh! Hold on let me get that This is exciting people are coming! Linda! What was that song you sang last time with John! Oh, Light Me Up. It's my boyfriend's composition Your boyfriend's composition? I have it! No way Way! Baby I see you walking past me But I swear your soul kissed my eternity Hold me closely with every touch I'll make you believe in me You killed me with purity you separated all the blood in my soul light me up tone me down moi your palette vous my song Your touch illustrates colors into my skin Oh, wonderful! I want to propose a toast to the lady who brought music to this party Oh! Thank you That's why I love organising music groups you get to sing together and you have so much fun This is what young people need to bear in mind and take away Music is the way to stay modest and humble in this world I don't want to sound like the annoying uncle but.. Well, I'm afraid you do When you generalise about "all young people" and then you talk about modesty and humility sorry it's just a real bugbear of mine Sorry Who are you? I'm Samantha Why? Does that make a difference? Guys, come on Is that the booze talking? No, just me being a bitch Oh, I need to get this sorry You know honey I truly believe, that when one believes enough there's nothing one can't achieve "The secret!" Yes darling! We create our own destiny with our energy Look, I'm sorry to interrupt but can I also state my opinion? I think all this "energy and believe in it and let your dreams come true is bullshit" Of course! It's all about taking selfies and posting on facebook and instagram. Not worth chasing your goals You know that's not my point at all and I don't take pictures and post what I eat on instagram I think these so called "secret" and other cliched sayings are just as commercial as your examples What cliche? The girl sings wonderfully and a living example of what we are all talking about here The girl doesn't sing at Carnegie Hall. She sings her boyfriend's songs at meetup parties. Oh it's not commercial enough for you. Whatever happened to simplicity and I'm not saying those are bad and I don't understand why everyone's got hostile when I express my opinion Not everyone I think these days, just like on facebook and instagram people made plastic versions of deep philosophies and psychological complexities and then they sell them by making them sound simple You know that they are sweet tricks to attract naive people. Oh you're making such a big thing of it. You have quite a big ego don't you? Shouldn't you be at home reading books and not wasting time at parties? I think may be you are right Guys.. come on Well seriously, first we have "all young people" generalization now we have this "psychology, philosophy, I know all that" I didn't say that No, but it's obvious that's what you're thinking Ok and who are you to judge me like that? Guys please, can we not spend the whole night arguing and throwing sass at each other? Let's show some respect for our host. Now I'm disrespectful Seriously I will not have this anymore at my house You're right honey don't be sad why don't we lighten the mood a bit? I'm not sad John! Honey, play something for us No, seriously if I play the piece I've been practising lately This party is going to be doomed Mmm I like the sound of that It's so difficult. I.. Oh come on honey this is not a concert hall! Okay for the sake of changing the mood I'll give it a go is anyone gonna tell me what's going on? Now people go missing? It's all right darling, I got you! It makes sense She's fainted No way? Do you mind? Oh fuck! Fuck Jody? Wait, Jody! Jody! JODY! Jody! Jody! Jody wait! Jody stop! Jody I'm not going to hurt you Listen to me Jody Jody wait! Jody! wait! Jody I know what you're thinking What? You know what What do you want me to say? I mean You're bloody fainting or whatever and you wake up on the floor and you are telling me this is not one of your episodes? Lara I told you, and I told mum this wasn't one of those if you just get in touch with these people you have it all clear in your mind, you'll know what happened Yeah and face the humiliation what humiliation? Come on Lara, you know these people played a prank on me! Or what are you saying? I just passed out and had an hour long hallucination is that it? I'm not saying anything and I told you, don't put this on me This is not helping Julie I want to help you I'm just trying to understand Julie Ok. So the way I see it, there's two options the first, you are right. They played a huge prank on you, well done them Second you know you've been on so much medication Second! Right, second! I'm crazy. Julie come on Don't Julie me. It's so easy for you isn't it? I'm trying to help you I'm not just talking about you, it's all of you. You, mum, everybody! You have no idea what I'm going through do you? Let go Give up You know it's best There's a woman upstairs I told you they are chasing after me. No one believes me I'm not making this up She must have left Oh... Mum. I know that tone. We both know it don't we? Can I just... Mum please Baby! Please don't do that! What have you done to yourself? My baby! Why? I'm giving this to you But I'm not letting go of the meaning and the experience that we shared I'll keep that forever and I know you will too I will I don't have any words any more guess that's the point right? Shall we hug? Thank you Hi Julianne thanks for calling I've got your e mail I can fit you in at 4 o'clock tomorrow. 4 o'clock tomorrow is fine Great, I'll see you at my private practise Ok Ok. Bye Bye Hey! Hey I organised this meetup party for creative people It just went awfully wrong They are all after me now They are trying to kill me in my dreams but it just seems so real I'm really scared I'm actually going to die Did this start about the party? Your dreams I mean I've always had trouble with my sleep sleepwalking, when half awake, hallucinating but nothing this extreme there is something really wrong this time This woman Elisabeth and the piano guy John he played this piece at the party and everything just went wrong after that What was it like before this happened? What kind of people are they? They were actually the nicest and the friendliest ones towards me I don't understand That's interesting so they were nice and now they're your monsters Yes. They were really supportive And how are you? What, now? Not just now In general Do you support yourself? I I My questions made you sad I I hurt I've got no choice I look like this cheerful and nice person but I'm this.. This! You feel you have no choice. It helps you to hurt yourself I understand You do? Have you seen a therapist before Julianne? A psychiatrist.. My mum took me He said I had bp something. Borderline? Bipolar? Borderline He was an asshole Didn't end well Ended quite messy actually Life isn't always beautiful How do these people kill you? They strangle me Can just pushed me to the ground and Elisabeth caught me off guard If you see them in your dreams they aren't other people What do you mean? You catch yourself off guard You are strangling yourself Ok. You are scaring me now. I don't mean to scare you Julianne but what you're saying already is scary Where do these people come from? Who brings them here? Oh right, here you go You know what? You can go to hell All of you I don't know why I even bothered What's wrong Julianne? What's wrong? You are wrong All these people are in my head right? Well good for you, so clever, you nailed it I don't understand You won't need to I don't think you should go like this Yeah? watch me! No What? Who do you think you are? Get out of my way! I'm not getting out of your way until you manage to stay with me Don't you fucking shout at me you crazy bi... I am not shouting at you because I'm angry I'm trying to reach you What is this? You think you can use force to stop me Look into my eyes. Is that what you see? What are you doing? I'm trying to stay with you Julianne Why? Because I think no one else does Is my hand all right there? I don't want to do this I know I know it's painful But I'm here and I want to be here In your pain What happened there I'm interested in your reaction Has this happened before? You have no idea what I'm going through do you? Fuck your care! Thanks for your loving and caring chat Almost always Right You didn't have to be a bitch though I know I'm sorry I had to improvise I'm not feeling worse I won't stay for long I just want to make sure you are in one piece Mum I don't want to talk about this That's why people go to therapy right? It's private Oh do they now? And what's there to keep from one's own mother? Who's worried as hell and who's getting messages from her daughter's best friend that she's worried All I wanted is for you.. Yeah that's not fair is it? What do you want.. What do I want ha? Oh Did she give you that individualistic crap? I should have found you a therapist Mum can you stop making this about her? I just told her what happened and The party Yeah. Not just that What do you mean? Oh Did someone leave you Julianne? Oh we are not going there I think we are there I think you are there all the time What? Do that some more What? Why? Looks like they're doing the talking They are doing what you're not saying I don't want to talk about it Then don't Let your hands do the talking Here Try on this Come on Do it some more How does it feel? Stupid Yes What else? More stupid? So say it Say it to the stupid cushion. Try What? Stupid? Yes Try it more But.. Come on Julianne Say it Let go Listen to your body What do you notice? My back Stupid You're angry Julianne You seem angry I am angry! I'm fucking angry! Yes. Julianne I'm with you let go I can't I can't Who is it Julianne? What the cushion? Who left you? My father When? I never met him I'm trying to reach you You are strangling yourself Am I supposed to feel guilty about it now? How wonderful the way you emphasize the "I" No I should Oh mum please don't start with the I should haves What? You are looking for someone to blame and you don't want to take it fine, blame me blame me for not burning that bloody letter Blame me for having you I chose to understand him forgive him No listen, he's a ghost in my life I mean, you don't talk about him all I know is that he didn't want me and he didn't want you because of me I think you should stop seeing that woman I don't want your nose in all this OK? My nose? I'm paying for it Yeah Well listen, I want you out of here I want it more than you do, you spoiled little brat Go snivel to that so sacred therapist It's too early to play the jealous card! She never drank it did she? Leave it I was really worried about you it was an absolute horrow show you went through you know? Yeah Are you still seeing that therapist? Yeah I am And actually its after seeing her that I've been feeling different How long do you have to see her for? Is there a time when she just says "darling you're cured"? It's gonna be a while I mean we have an open ended contract And.. She says " We are at a very important point in our journey" Oh yes? What? Well I know I know it's private and everything, but I mean if you wanted to give me any juicy details on what you guys talk about Yeah of course I wouldn't have a stroke telling you It just all comes down to mum I know she'd freak out if she knew how much she damaged me but I know she didn't do it intentionally Yeah. Parents. Constantly unintentionally fucking things up. Yep! So this serious work, tell me. You know, what is it she says to you that actually makes a difference it's not so much about what she says it's more about how she is she has a way of entering and touching the core of things So she touches and enters? Yeah! She entered and touched my monsters! And then, and only then, can you learn to love yourself Oh yes! No I mean seriously, I know we are joking and all, but there's something really weird and unique happening in that room But you gotta admit it just sounds a bit What? Well, all of this going back to your childhood talking about mother issues it's not exactly going into your childhood I'm realising more and more it's we're all still in our childhoods, you know and somewhere along the way we desperately try and adapt to this adult world at least I am the thing is you can't spend your entire life just playing around, there has to be some limitation Why not? I mean, if everyone followed their heart at least we'd have real people instead of institutionalized zombies in that party, Samantha was so bitchy I'm not That piano guy, he was so creative. I'm not Elisabeth was so kind, I don't deserve it Jody was upfront, I can't be seen to be that rude Who am I in all this? I need to be myself as well you know? I see what you're saying but the thing is, if we were all completely open and honest with our friends all the time some of those friendships would seize to exist Exactly! So we need to find a way to embrace that openness not try and live at this plastic prison of pretense Plastic. I like that All right girls? Hello darling Don't mind me I'm just off to the gym Enjoy your play date Bay baay So where were we? Something about plastic people? Yeah I mean I feel like I need to I need to reset and start from scratch But I feel so fragile when you let go of your habitual ways it's like you turn into a baby who is acidentally a 25 year old It's meeting your true self that's so painful and sometimes awkward. That's when Carol nurtures me that's when she stays compassionate and firm at the same time man that's deep Yeah. It is Hi Peter it's Carol So, sitting here I.. Am very much left with our last meeting and with Julianne Yes I was a bit defensive last time we spoke about her I'm sure that you were concerned So please, tell me more about Julianne well she started to self harm when she found her father's letter but I feel the root of her problems stems way back to her mother's depression when Julianne was a baby she grew up with guilt a sense that she owed her existence to her mother. Who chose Julianne after her father a party mirrored her projections of her real self A party? Yes Her projections began to haunt her. As if they were going to kill her, but in actual fact.. I see where you're going with this Carol but it's just the way you talk about her there is something unsettling for me here is there some particular pull or confluence for you with Julliane in terms of your own unfinished business? My miscarriage I'm concerned that your longing for your lost girl is getting in the way of your ethical practise Carol Yes I am longing for my lost girl but it doesn't affect my work I think it does Carol it's clear to me that you are unable to gauge appropriate interventions with this client I think you are too sensitive to carry on working with Julianne at this stage. Especially with her alarming situtation I will have to consult with the ethics comitee about this You must understand He's just being a jerk I don't blame him totally It's a miysterious field unlike medicine Yeah I hear what you are saying I still can't understand why you guys can't sit down and talk about it with more reason You've been doing this for more than 15 years and so is he. It's all about the human soul and psyche messy But you love that aspect of it for the first time I'm worried about your career though I'll be fine There's no real danger in me continuing my private practise anyway Are you sure about that? Yeah. Just the ethics comitee still have to make a decision say something else before I go to sleep I don't want to dream about my supervisor Something else Ohhh very funny good night You're so bad, you're so bad! You're so naughty What? Untie me! Untie you sweety but, I don't see any ropes my legs! "My legs" This is a nightmare Ohh "this is a nightmare" I'll close my eyes and when I open them again, it will all be gone Ohh we both know that isn't true don't we? It's not a dream It's happening! "It's not a dream" I've got something to tell you I have something to tell you I have something to say It's not going to be easy but I'll just say it I don't want to come anymore it's quite sudden I'm surprised and well, curious Well, I'm not sure what we're doing here is actually helping me I do feel different something did change from the very first day I came to see you I don't cut myself that much almost never I feel more pain but also more energy but then again this is what scares me this? This change my dreams are move vivid and strange I'm sleepwalking even more than I used to Before we decide wether you want to go on with me or not shall we talk more about your dreams and your fear? Of course I was raped last night And it.. It was so real I can't even begin to tell you how I felt Do you know who it was? Lara's boyfriend so not anyone from the party then this time No but this was worse it was disgusting and it was unacceptable you mean the rape of course no I don't mean the rape Ok. I'm listening Towards the end of my dream I went crazy and I started laughing and enjoying myself so it wasn't rape after all then well it was in the beginning but then I could move my arms and my legs but I didn't resist I felt sort of free and happy and mad. Mad how does it make you feel now_? Pregnant and horrible pregnant? I'm scared. I can't go on with this I really hear your struggle Julianne. I can only imagine how difficult it must be for you to trust in such a painful process without knowing how or where it will end. I don't want to carry on with this The bad news is Once you are aware there is no turning back but if you stay with it, with enough support you will be nourished what awareness? Lara's boyfriend the rape I don't think this was just plainly sexual Do you remember Samantha's visions? You made piece with her the more we worked on it she became you and you became her and only then were you able to critisize my hair and my office you were able to tell Lara that she wasn't relating to you without losing it you felt OK about complaining Samantha. She was there in the dream She was making out with Frank I really think something is trying to get your attention here Julianne It's almost symbolic like something is being born Frank is your best friend's lover that's hard for you to get a handle on it it takes courage it's too new too unfamiliar You're right. I can't handle it nor do I want to It's hard to let you go at this point Julianne especially when you've come such a long way but I'm not gonna stop you this time not like our first meeting but I want you to know I genuinely support your struggle Ok Thank you Carol What did Elisabeth look like? Did she have reddish hair? Short in her 70s. Evet ama Why? Did you meet her? It's difficult to explain She said she had something to tell me What? I don't know I woke up What? She was in your dream? Yes I don't understand I don't understand either I had an image of us, when you walked in, you were trying to leave We were wrestling Wrestling? Yes Do you want to try it? As much as you can I could do this all day No, no, it's just that she is not usually late Not to worry the piccadilly line is slow anyway No, no she usually calls Mmm! This wine is amazing! Hello darling! There she is How long since we last saw each other ha? Don't let her hug you, she'll probably break your bones Oh shut up, come on Hello Yes, this is she Sorry? Oh Sorry I was just I'm just What? Here? Now? How did you even.. What do you want? Please Julianne, I just want to see you Why? There is something I have to tell you I have to say something to you Does mum know you're here? Nobody knows Please Julianne So dear tell me How is the practise going? Darling, you know you can't Thanks Richard I'm not really a fan of talking about my work but it's fine I'm sorry, I just want to know how everything is everything including but it's Ok if you don't want to talk about it No no, it's fine. It's still the same as you saw me 7 years ago when I first accredited Oh what a time that was Actually, I'm enjoying it even more Although sometimes the practicalities are a bit you know.. It's so good to see you without hiding for once So this is my girl I know nothing I say is gonna make things any better Do you also know that what you're doing is actually making things worse Just give me 5 minutes Do you have a favorite client? Darling, that's like asking if you have a favorite child It is a difficult question Richard I agree Although I do have a favorite client I couldn't let go I missed your mother so much But we were so very young I know the story you don't have to repeat it What do you want I wanted to tell you that none of this was your fault or your mother's it was love stupid love we were imprisoned as teenagers but you you never had any say in any of this I guess I just wanted to apologise and tell you I'll never forgive myself Goodbye Julianne I won't be following you anymore I just want to give you this I'm not taking this.

No I don't A father? That I do I had one too not the one who just killed himself and shot me that one loved me I could see it in his eyes hear it in his voice but I didn't recognize that man I'm more familiar with the one that left me and my mum the one who didn't care I see Do you know what is most dangerous in this life detective? Oh I hope to have an idea by now Probably not It's not the guns detective It's love Look where love led my father test people with it and guns will come out is that what happened here? Precisely.

I finally met my true self Look at my eyes detective I did not kill my father Do your searching Do your investigation but don't forget to add to all that lot what you see in my eyes you are a good person detective I'm glad we met I do have a favorite client Therapy is all about connection My connection with her feels like it started before we even met through her longing she helped me to embrace my own wound and my own grief my lost child, whom I never talk about every wound is an unfinished business until they're processed deeply, truly You know how they say things are connected in mysterious ways ways we don't know of we may never understand One thing I know though the more we can connect to this world with fullness with our whole being the more we shine Long, long, long, long think of a corridor Step by step, step by step A strike that I went to from myself, and from you the most beautiful things that happened to me from my mind from my thoughts You have never existed anyway Slowly, slowly, slowly slowly think I'm gone Heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy while decreasing my load from your shoulder from your chest Remaining behind the most beautiful days from my love, from my life you have never existed anyway you have never existed anyway
