JUNE 25, 1950 The wine tastes great. Does it taste good? It sure does. Right. Mom is the best wine maker. I wonder why no one wants to marry her. I would have married her a million times. Hey, you should find me a man. What is that? A storm? Mom, doesn't your body ache? It's fine. That means that can't be a storm. Then, what could it be? What are they doing? Don't you see? They're building a fence. Why are they putting a fence on the top of a mountain? Indeed, what on earth! He seems like he's trying to tell us something. He seems to want us to come nearer. He probably needs some help. The wind is quite strong. Maybe we should help them. Then let's all go and help. -Okay, let's go. -Let's go. It's okay. It's all in the day's work. Let's spread out. You go over to that side. Let's help them. Don't worry. -One, two, three. -Here we go. -One, two, three. -Up. -One, two, three. -Up. -One, two, three. -Up. Gosh, it's exhausting. -Hey. -Yes? How about a drink? Come on over. -Sounds good. -Right. Why are you stopping us? After all the help we have given you. That's my brother. That's my brother. -Hyun-sik, what are you doing there? -What is this? -Come on over. -Let us go there. Why are you stopping us? Let go of me. I'm going to my brother. Let go of me. Hyun-sik. -Let go of me! -Hyun-sik! -Let go of me! -Hyun-sik! -Let go of me! -Hyun-sik! No! -Let go of me! -I have to go there! What are you doing? Let go of me. I can't. -I know what you're up to. -Let go of me. How would I let you go? Who are you to stop me? You're driving me crazy. Let go of me, you idiot. -I can't let you go. -Not again, Young-tan. -God damn it! -My goodness. -Get your hands off me. -What is it this time? Good thing you came, Mom. Let go of me. I can't believe this man. Fine, it's only natural for a widower to look for a widow. Let go of me. But how long has it been since Man-soo's mother passed away? It has only been a few days. He should mourn for at least a year or two. How dare he try and remarry this soon? Does this make sense to you? What are you looking at? Hey. -Oh, god. -It's none of your business. Let's go. Mom, give me a second. -Let's just go, you brat. -Mom. -Come on. -I will be a teacher. -Let's just go. -I can't let this happen. -Mom. -Let's go. -Mom, let go of me. -Hurry. -What an idiot. -Let's go. -You want to be a teacher? -It's none of your business. Are we going or not? Seriously! -Young-tan. -Yes, Dad? Our family depends on you. You shouldn't be stuck on this tiny island. Go. Go out there and become a great teacher, okay? Thank you, Dad. You have failed for the past ten years. Do you really think you have a chance? Dad, don't you trust me? I have a dream. Please, support me. Your sisters have to get married, and we also need money for us to make ends meet. Just let him go. That would make our lives here much easier. Can you at least give us one stack? How are we going to survive? Just trust him. Just one stack. What? That's my bag! Thief! Somebody get him! Thief! My bag! -Somebody please get him! -What the hell? Guys, get him. Who is he? Find my bag, please. All my fortune is in it. Someone took my bag. I get it. Wait over there until I call you. Why did you drag me here? Find my bag. Gosh. What are you doing? Take him away. -Damn. -Find my bag. -Come here. -Please, find my bag. -Where did I put it? -Find my bag. -Where did it go? -Please, help me. Please, find my bag. Forget it. Just go away. So this is what happened. I came out of the station. -Are you talking about your bag? -Yes, please find it. A bag? A bag... You moron. Do you see any bag here? Why would you hit me? I'm just asking for help! Why? You stupid moron. Stay right there, you idiot. You got beaten up pretty badly. But it's not the worst. They will let us go soon. I'm not leaving before I find my bag. What bag? Just give it up. -Are they really letting us go? -What? I have been here a few times. This line is for us who had a warning. That one is for the correction institute. Correction institute? Yes. Those guys will be sent to the correction institute. Shut your mouth! Okay. Can I go to the bathroom? I need to pee. Shut up, you scum. Let them out. Hurry up and get out. Get the hell out. Hurry up and get out. Go on. Come. You don't want to go there. What the hell? SAMCHEONG CORRECTION INSTITTUE One for all! All for one! -All for one. -Come on! So I'm in the correction institute now. Why is it so hard to become a teacher? -All for one! -Something doesn't feel right. -One for all. -One for all. -All for one. -All for one. Can't you pull over for a minute? I need to pee. CHEONGSOL-RI 3KM Man overboard! Man overboard! Stop! Man overboard! Man overboard! What should I do? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Go. Cheongsol-ri... CHEONGSOL-RI 3KM CHEONGSOL-RI 3KM CHEONGSOL-RI 3KM This lake is preserved. Although the water is good for the skin, bathing is not allowed. See? He's lost. Is this the guy? He doesn't look like it. Who else can he be, then? Then, let's wake him up. Leave him be. He's sleeping so soundly. Gosh, you startled me. I saw a fairy. What fairy? Do you have any idea how long we have waited for you? Do you know me? We just met. Everyone is waiting. Let's go. Are you sure he's the right one? Who else could he be, then? Who are you? He is the chief of our village. Nice to meet you. You, too. Could you turn around? Turn again. 948... What is that number for? I got it when I entered the education institute. Education institute? Which one? Samcheong. Samcheong University? He is from Samcheong University. -I see. -I see. Welcome, sir. Welcome. I heard you got lost. I'm glad that you made it. Here we are. Our previous teacher stayed here. We cleaned it up for you. I will be staying here? You don't like it? That's not it. I just don't understand why you are so nice to me. What do you mean? Why are you so nice to me? Of course, I should be. Where are your books? They got stolen. Oh, my. Even dogs don't care for teachers' poop. Sorry? Never mind. We have the books from our previous teacher. Some of his stuff is still there, too. I'm sure that it will be fine. Then I will come back in the morning. Goodnight, teacher. Who pooped here? Sir. Sir. I'm not a teacher yet. I followed the signs. What is this? Gosh, I have to poop. Poop becomes a very good fertilizer. What is this? MINE Wait. Let me see. Is it really a mine? Did I just step on a mine? I mean... Why isn't there any sign or anything? God damn it. There are kids walking around. I mean... Oh, gosh. Wait. I'm not supposed to take my foot off. God damn it. Let me see. Where the hell am I? Hello? Gosh. I must be in the middle of nowhere. My hair is too short. And my eyes look puffy from too much sleep. Still, I don't look too bad. Teacher? Here we are. The school is tiny. But once you start teaching... -Sir. -Yes? I have something to tell you. Something isn't right. I'm not a teacher yet. Come on. You majored in education. I did get into the institute, but I haven't finished yet. I need to study some more. Sir, you don't like this school? That's not it. The school might look shabby, but it's better than any school in a larger town. Your salary isn't bad either. Is that so? What do you say? That sounds wonderful. Then, be our teacher. Would that be really okay? Sir, the moment I saw you, I knew you were the one. You are a true patriot, who is following in Jung-geun An's footsteps. I saw it right away. My goodness. Thank you. -Let's go. -Just a second. I have a question. I saw a woman in the valley over there yesterday. She was bathing. A woman? Yes. She looked like a fairy, splashing around. Does she live around here? A fairy? We sure are deep in the mountains. Let's go in first. -Does she live near here? -Yes. Fairies have wings, don't they? That's an angel. -Angels... -Fairies have wings, too. They don't. Let me introduce our new teacher... What is your name? -Young-tan Gong. -Right. As an honorable patriot, Mr. Gong... Young-tan. With Mr. Gong here, you can start studying again. Mr. Gong graduated from a famous university in Seoul. It wasn't in Seoul. It wasn't? No. Anyway, he studied in a big city. It wasn't a city. It wasn't? No. Anyway, Mr. Gong graduated from a famous university. He kindly came here to teach you guys. So study hard. Do you understand? -Yes! -Yes! Help! Hello? Somebody help me! I stepped on a mine! Help! Here. Is this for me? Yes. This is not just an ordinary hen. I fed it with wild ginseng. Wild ginseng? Yes. Nothing could be better for your health than this. Mr. Gong. Are you in? Mr. Gong, you should try these. They are not just ordinary eggs. My hen laid them after eating a white snake. -A white snake? -Yes. I know a thing or two about snakes. This one was white from head to tail. -Not a single spot. -That's all crap. If it was eaten by a hen, it can't have been a snake. My hen would be much better for your health. I saw it with my own eyes. When? Where? He has no evidence. You rude bastard. My goodness. Let's ask the teacher. Which came first, chickens or eggs? Eggs came first, obviously. Shut up. The teacher must know which came first. Which came first, chickens or eggs? Chickens came first, right? Eggs came first, right? In my opinion... -Yes? -Yes? Chicks came first. Chicks? Mr. Gong, it's me. Wait. I was wondering where you two were, and you were bothering the teacher. No, we're not bothering him. You're not? You two always bother teachers with chickens and eggs. That's why the teachers don't want to stay here long. Don't worry. They were just being nice to me. It's a trick. Don't fall for it. They will drive you crazy. Our previous teacher... got so sick of them and ran away... How did you know I was here? Emerge... No one has informed me. Tow... -Town hall? -Yes. -Hu... -Okay. You go on ahead. I will be there soon. Okay. That's amazing. You understood him? I have been living here for a long time. You will get used to it soon, too. What are you two waiting for? Leave the teacher alone. -Is everything all right? -Yes. Okay. Thank you. So, a new teacher came? Yes. Do you think he will stay for a while? He doesn't look too smart. I think I can persuade him. For your mom's 70th birthday, is the upper village in charge? We came to discuss that. You're going to share the food with us, right? Be serious. -When will you grow up? -Gosh. I'm turning 40 soon. Stop hitting my head. I'm your uncle. Come on. I'm two years older than you, for fuck's sake. "For fuck's sake"? What a bastard. -With my iron palm... -Dal-soo. Not the iron palm. No matter what, shouldn't we prepare Mom's birthday party together? Of course. We are preparing as well. All right. Since a new teacher came, let's get back early. Let's get going. -Let's have some drink. -Wait. -What? -What about the things I asked for? Oh, that. The lady didn't have the exact same thing you asked for. -Oh, how pretty. -I'm not sure if... You like them? -And this. -It will take a while. This is said to be very popular in Seoul right now. -What is this? -Let's go ahead. Stop it. This is so tacky. Look at it. You go ahead. This is not what I asked for. Do you think this suits a young and pretty girl like me? What are you talking about? What is with this color? Sun-mi. What? Did you bathe in the valley recently? No. Someone saw you. Who? There's this guy. Where are you hiding? I won't eat you. Come out. What is this? It hurts. Be honest with me. I won't do it anymore. Are you sure? Someone might see. -Your skin has become so soft. -Oh, my. Don't touch me! Don't move. I just want to make sure. What are you talking about? I don't do it anymore, I swear. -Sun-mi. -What is with you? Let go of me. Who... Mr. Gong. This is my sister-in-law, Sun-mi. Mr. Gong is our new teacher. What are you doing right now? I can't believe this. -What are you talking about? -How dare you raise your voice? Miss, you shouldn't do that. I understand that he is your brother-in-law, but you shouldn't have followed him there at this hour. Hey, look, Mr. Gong. Be quiet. Shame on you. Because you followed him without thinking, the chief thought he could do that to you. What are you talking about? You made him think... he could come on to you. You bastard! Sun-mi. What just happened? I just wanted to poop. What did I do that was so wrong? All I did was poop. You have heard of the spies... that came to Gupabal last spring, right? Because they crossed the border here, my colonel friend got demoted. There might be some more spies to come down soon. Where will they cross the border? Here? No. We found underground tunnels around there two years ago. What about here? Are they stupid? The spies got caught there last spring. Then... where? Right here. It's highly likely that they will cross the border here in my jurisdiction. Captain Ma. What is my dream? Your dream is to become a general of Korea, sir. Did you all hear it? If something bad happens and I fail to become a general, that will be the end of my life. I will kill all of you and myself. So... you'd better do your job. Why aren't you answering me? Answer! -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. What is with you guys? -Ten. -Eleven. -Twelve. -Thirteen. -Fourteen. -Fifteen. -Sixteen. -Seventeen. -Eighteen. -Nineteen. -Twenty. -Twenty one. -Twenty two. -Twenty three. Done. Don't move! Hey. Who are you? Me? He is our new teacher. Teacher? We haven't been informed of a new teacher, have we? We have, sir. What? Then, why didn't you report to me? I did report to you, sir. You will have to run to the camp. We're leaving, sir. Poor bastard. Mr. Gong. Oh, gosh. You're not teaching today? I'm taking a break. What's that? It's wine bottling day. A wine bottling day? Yes. We make wine every year. I will give you some later. -Look. -Yes? Do you know the chief's sister-in-law? Well... How do you know Sun-mi? I saw her yesterday. She got caught? You have seen it, too? Well... What is it? Tell me what's going on. The thing is... Gosh. Hey! Hey! Damn it. Hey, everyone has a different taste. What a waste. Can't we just drink it? I did it for everyone's sake. My goodness. We should either get a new chief or fix his tongue. I tasted it on behalf of our ancestors. Chief! We have a problem. What's the matter? She got caught? -What do you mean? -Sun-mi! -What did he say? -He grilled me about what is going on. Then we should do something. That damn teacher... I didn't mean to get caught. You clean up here. -Gosh. -Shit. -Damn it. -Seriously! Five potatoes. You write that like this. Let's say I ate five potatoes. That's when you use "minus". How many would be left now? Five. Five. That's right. What should I write here? Five? Like this? That's right, five. Brilliant! You're so smart! -Smart. -Smart. Numbers are not that hard. Right? Five. Dear brothers and sisters in South Korea... She's lying through her teeth. Don't listen to her, okay? We know that. Is that so? Let's go back to... Seriously? Women with a loud voice like that are usually ugly. She's pretty. How do you know that? He means, she may look pretty. Let me tell you. Women with a voice like that are never pretty. You have seen the village chief, right? Imagine he has long hair. Imagine there is a person like that. But what if that person is a woman? How would she look? -Disgusting. -Disgusting. Do you think she could... So you're snooping around asking questions about my sister-in-law? Are you afraid that the word will spread? I'm serious. My wife is 12 years younger than me. Her sister is 12 years younger than her. -There is a 24-year gap... -And yet you still hit on her? You're a jerk. No, I swear. The kids can hear you. She doesn't live around here. She lives in the upper village. Upper village? She lives in... Anyway, I was only seeing her off. We tripped because it was so dark. That's all. If you were seeing her off, why did you take her the persimmon field? That's the only way... I was only seeing her off. Are you sure? If I had any other intention, God will punish me. You better be careful, then. I have a class to teach. -That's not... -Take your hands off me. -How dare you touch me? -Come on. God damn it. "When I stole a kiss from him, my heart was pounding. Soon my ears were filled with the sound of bells blessing our love. It made it clear to me... that this love was my fate." Sun-mi. Yes? Comrade Sun-mi. -Hey! -Yes? I told you to knock! I just... Just what? I got this yesterday. Before the broadcasting... My goodness. Bring it here. Anything else? No. I will be going. Hey! Yes? Come here. What are you doing? What's wrong? Comrade Sun-mi. God. I'm a sinner. Forgive me. I'm so hungry. If you give me some food, I will... God is here! Thank you, God! Gosh, I have had enough. Mr. Gong, say something. Am I making you nervous? -Yes! -Yes! You're driving us crazy. Let's get back to the classroom. You don't have to be in the classroom to learn. I'm going crazy, too. I have been thinking too much. Then take some pills! What pills? Is there a pharmacy anywhere around here? -Young-hee. -Yes? You're ten years old, right? Yes. This is just not okay. "He got a seed." "Nol-bu decided to..." -Hey. -"go..." What brings you here? You're not stuttering. I can speak normally unless I'm frustrated or hurried. Is that so? A white snake is supposed to help. A white snake? Do you want to try this? This egg is from a hen that ate a white snake. It's such a precious thing. Can you gather the villagers without the chief knowing? Without the chief knowing? Yes. I'm afraid I can't. Don't be like that. I can't. -Come on. A white snake, remember? -Gosh. I'm sorry. Can you spread your legs a bit? Oh, my. Roll your pants up. -All the way up. -God, he does have fair skin. -My goodness. -Tell me about it. All the way up. Now tell me what you think. Okay? -Okay. -Okay. -Oh, my. -What are you doing? -What is he doing? -That's embarrassing. -My goodness. -What's he doing? What does it look like? It looks like a man is screwing a woman. He's right. -A man is screwing a woman. -What are you talking about? But what if... How distasteful. What if they're related? -What? -That's unacceptable. -That's horrible. -What the... -How dare they? -What's he saying? -How dare you? -That's disgusting. Let me tell you a little about the man. What if he is one of the villagers? He lives here? -That's impossible. -There's no one who could do that. -Not in our village. -Hold on! -That's absurd. -You're right. Who are you talking about? Are there many widowers over 50 in this village? There is only one. -Why are you looking at me? -What? -No way. -That's not possible. -What are you doing? Come here. -That's absurd. -It can't be true. -That's funny. -You're certainly mistaken. -It can't be. It's him. What is everyone doing here? Stop staring at me. Dong-gu, I saw the chief... in the persimmon field. Are you sure this is the right path? The road is rougher there. His sister-in-law took that way, too. This road leads to the upper village. Is that right? Yes. -Mr. Gong. -Yes? I need to feed my cow. Okay. Go then. -Mr. Gong. -Yes? Never stray from the path. -Okay? -I get it. See you later. -Mackerel. -Not mackerel. I'm not a mackerel. I'm a human. Mr. Gong. You scared us. I'm lost. How can I get to the upper village? Upper village? You can't go any farther than this. Sorry? There is no village north of us? You must be mistaken. There is no upper village? If you wander around here, you might get shot. Mines are everywhere, too. -Mr. Gong. -Mr. Gong. See? The whole village is looking for you. We were so worried. Our previous teacher stepped on a mine in the reeds and died. Silver grass. -Reeds. -You idiot. Cut it out. Are you in the position to scold us? Think of what you did. This. What is that? We know what you did... -in the persimmon field. -Hey. I don't know what you're talking about. Mr. Gong, you shouldn't wander around. You don't know your way around here. Never wander around alone. Guess why I went there. It's because you keep lying to me. I wanted to see for myself. I said, you're wrong. -Stop yelling at the teacher. -Right. You don't have the right to scold anyone. -What? -Whose side are you on? -Mr. Gong... -Stop it. Mr. Gong, I'm relieved you're safe. Take some rest. -Yes. -I'm so sorry I made you worry. -Don't worry. -It's okay. It's someone else's fault. Stop it. You should go home now. -Sure. -Okay. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Look. We need to talk. You didn't even give me any chance to explain. How could you trust everything that teacher says? Hey, lie down again. Look now. If you were only seeing her off... Why did you end up like this? That's not how you see someone off. What does it look like? My goodness. I didn't do that. I was seeing Sun-mi off. And we heard someone. So I covered Sun-mi's mouth and... lay down on her. How do you explain this? Why were her legs exposed? She was wearing a skirt. That's why her legs were exposed. Do you really think I did that to Sun-mi in that mosquito infested field? Fine. What do we do about the teacher? We can't just let him be. You must take responsibility and clear up any misunderstanding. What's that? What's this? A bunker? Oh, god. It's so dark I can't see anything. So annoying. Why am I so pretty? I have to eat to survive. Robinson Crusoe made it. I can make it, too. My legs are numb. Who is there? Help! Someone is here! I can't move. Hey! I heard you! Help! I heard you! I heard a rustle! Come here. Come on. Are you in? Yes, come in. Good morning, Mr. Gong. The chief would like to see you. Why? His sister-in-law is here. I hope it's nothing serious. We're just warning North Koreans. You know that. I'm here. Can you wait over there? Where is your sister-in-law? Wait over there. You have a sister-in-law? Well... We're all family in this village. Dong-gu's mom and Young-hee are like sisters-in-law to me. Dong-gu's mom? You wanted me to come here for them? Just wait over there. What is this? I was in the middle of cooking. Then have some persimmons. I would lose my appetite if I did. This is for you. There will be a night artillery training. -Please make sure everyone stays inside. -Sure. Mr. Gong, come to our camp with the chief sometime. Why? Just do it. Our colonel is on my nerves already. -Take care. -Let's go. Try not to offend the soldiers. What did I do? He got angry for no reason. Also, are you... Have they left? She's here? Do you have something against my brother-in-law? I don't. Then do you have something against me? No. Then, why are you doing this? The chief hit on you, right? He didn't. He was seeing me off, and we fell. There's no path around there. It's a shortcut to my village. Stop lying. He hit on you, didn't he? He didn't! Let me ask you one more thing. Then... do you have feelings for him? What? If he didn't hit on you, was it your idea to... I can't believe you. Fine, it was my idea. What are you going to do now? Sun-mi. -Let go of me. -Sun-mi. Let go of me. I have nothing to do with it. Don't call me again. Sun-mi, I will walk with you. It's too late. Why don't you sleep over? Should I sleep under my brother-in-law? Hey. I will ask Young-hee's dad to see you off. Forget it. It's too late. You shouldn't walk alone. Let go of me right now. Fine, I'm sorry... Mom! Gosh. What is that? You're unbelievable. What a pain in the ass. He said, "I hate communists." The North Korean soldiers beat him and asked again. Seung-bok said again, "I hate communists." It made the soldiers lose it. They tore up the boy's mouth and killed him brutally. How old was the boy? Not all North Koreans are bad. What did you say? Nothing. I'm not saying all North Koreans are bad. That's not the point. The point is that you can be put in the same situation as him. If North Korean soldiers ask you the same question, just keep quiet. They will probably keep asking. Then... you should just mumble. Save yourselves, okay? Okay! Good. That's all for today. Dong-gu, can we talk? This will be in the next math test. Please throw it away on your way home. How do I get to the upper village? I don't know. Think carefully. Your parents will be happy if you become the top of the class. I really don't know. Did the chief make you say that? No. It's okay. I even saw the chief go into a bunker. What? Does that bunker lead to the upper village? I don't know. I really don't. Hey! I don't want to see him again. What can we do? Meet him and clear this misunderstanding. Otherwise, he will start telling people. It never seems to end. Sun-mi. I'm sorry. What a sight. Mr. Gong. Unbelievable. You dug a cozy tunnel. Are you two really dating? Mr. Gong! The villagers will be here any minute. -Mr. Gong! -Mr. Gong! I'm here! Why did you have to do this? What did I do? What do you think you saw today? What do you mean? I saw you two lying down together at night. I even saw you hugging in the tunnel. Isn't it obvious? That's not what I'm asking. Then, what the hell was it? Were you playing hide-and-seek in that tunnel? It's impossible to talk to you. Again? Back off. -Hey. -My goodness. -Why would you hit his head? -We should never ask you to do anything. You should have hit somewhere else. There is still a lot to ask. Water... Do you think that will wake him up? Look at him. He's dead. How many have you killed so far? They won't believe us -if we say he stepped on a mine, too. -You're right. Let's just leave him around the target practice area. Let's just take him to the reeds. He had been wandering around a lot. No one will become suspicious if he blew himself up. Let's not lose our humanity. Let's keep him in one piece. We can't just bury him. There is no humanity in killing. I say, just bury him. -You oppose everything I say. -Then -Think about it. -until the next teacher comes, what will the kids do? -I wish it would rain. -Dong-gu is already 12. -I don't think that's a good idea. -By the way, Mr. Gong doesn't seem to completely understand the situation. What if we keep him alive and deny everything? Do you think that will work? He will never stop. Still, I think it's too cruel to blow him up with a mine. How about hooking him up with Sun-mi? -What? -What? If his wife lives here, Mr. Gong will become one of us. -She's right. -That makes sense. That's nonsense. Now that I think of it, it's about time Sun-mi got married. It's already late. She will go through menopause soon. My goodness. You're embarrassing her. What do you think? Well... He doesn't seem to be a good breed, -but it might be better than... -Stop, everyone! Your teacher can't come for a while. Study on your own. Once upon a time, Confucius said... Is Mr. Gong coming back? He is. The other teachers never came back. Which of you want him back? Raise your hand. -Here! -Here! Don't send him to the reed field. Who told you that? Let him live here. Be quiet. I want to eat potatoes with him. -Me, too. -Me, too. ANSEO-MYEON TOWN OFFICE Hello. How have you been? Hey, it's you. Is everyone doing well? Of course. What are you doing here? Did something happen to your teacher again? No, that's not it. -It isn't? -Our teacher speaks a bit oddly. I'm a bit curious about him. Him? He's amazing. That young man volunteered to go into that mountain. He said he believed in education. When I heard that, I knew he was the right one. I could see that he was the teacher we were looking for. You're so lucky to have him. We're lucky? My ass. It was foolish of us to try to kill him. Think about it. My goodness. You were the one who suggested we bury him. I wanted to keep him in one piece. Your husband said we should blow him up. Are you going deaf? What? I didn't say that. It was Gil-joong's dad. When did I say that? He didn't say that. -I will smack your face. -What? Sit down. Be quiet. -My goodness. -Stop it. You don't even have the courage to go against me. I'm sick of hearing you yell. Just pair him off with Sun-mi. I'm not sure Sun-mi will like it. She doesn't seem to like him much. I'm more worried about the teacher. Sun-mi is so conceited. You're right. She is such a princess. There's no such thing as an easy relationship. It takes effort. Anyway, let's try to make it work. Mr. Gong. Let me ask you bluntly. Will you stay in this town? I would like to live with my parents in my hometown. What do you think of Sun-mi? Why? We would like to pair you two off. Are you crazy? She's going out with the chief. That's not true, I swear. Then why are you doing this to me? Are you dumping her on me? It's not that! -Oh, gosh. -Calm down. Hold him. You seem to want to stab me. -I would love to. -Calm down. What a scary matchmaker you are. What? Hear us out. He's a great teacher. I don't care. I don't like him. She doesn't like him. That's how it is at first. Just kill him, or I will. -Sun-mi. -Sun-mi. You can't do this to me. Don't you even care about my life? Sun-mi. -Come on. -Don't! I'm not kidding. I swam faster than a shark. Bong-gu is a good swimmer, too. You will never guess how fast he is. Swimming in the sea doesn’t even compare to doing it in a stream. In the sea, there are huge waves. It’s not easy to swim through them. The waves are just too big, but I still swam through them, faster than a shark. Do you think that's easy? I want to see the sea. You do? I will take you along when I go home. I will show you the sea and take you on a boat. I'm a master sailor. -Really? -Of course. I'm so excited. What about me? Take me, too. You can come, too. Yong-hyun. What would he be doing right now? Woo-chul. Dad, I'm sorry. I once broke his arm by accident. I'm such a bad son. We haven't talked in forever. Mom, I'm sorry. Dad. You should stop gambling though. Gambling destroys you. I told you to stop gambling with Mr. Kim. You even had to sold the house, and Mom ran away. You should be the one standing on this mine right here to stop gambling. You're breaking my heart. Dad! Woo-chul, I'm sorry! I miss you! Excuse me. Please... Help me. I stepped on a mine. Hey! Is he healthy? Who? The teacher. Yes. Then marry him. I barely know him. Do you know when I first saw my husband? It was on the wedding day. If he doesn't look too disgusting, just marry him. You're just like them. Do you know why? You're blowing your chance. What is wrong with you? I'm dying to get married again, but I can't seem to find any decent guy. If a healthy, normal guy is right in front of you, marry him. I would rather remain single. Do you want to live alone all your life? It would be better to just kill yourself. It doesn't feel like he is the one for me. It doesn't feel like it? Once he gets inside you, it will feel like it. You can't just sit back and wait. Nothing is ever going to happen. Nothing at all. You are cruel. Why am I cruel? Why are you here again? Are you going to save me? Why are you doing this to me? Please tell me why. I was right. I knew it. You're getting yourselves in trouble. Was this it? Without the government knowing, -you were digging out gold? -Come on. It's such a huge... Am I wrong? Wait. Oh, my. It's huge. What is this place? Sun-mi. Is it a tunnel or a cave? It's very long. Did we just come out to the same spot? Who are you? Welcome to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Sorry? We're in North Korea. Are you... Stop kidding around. It's not funny at all. WELCOME TO PYONGYANG Now, do you believe that you're in North Korea? This is ridiculous. Did I just cross the border? What an honor. Thanks to you, I get to see North Korea. You wanted to come here, Young-tan. Young-tan? Why do you call me that? From now on, I will call you that. Why? Have you made up your mind to marry me like how the others want you to? Don't. It will only make you miserable. I would rather die... than make the woman I love miserable. I don't know how to get back. Can you show me? This used to be our playground. Blood is thicker than water. After that line separated the families, they started digging a tunnel from both sides. In the end, we met here in this cave. Although it's in the center of the village... Look at how many bats are here. This cave is useless. Other than to store some food. Where is he? Do you know where I have been? National Security Agency, NSA! I didn't want to. But they made me. Do you know what they told me? According to them, a lot of spies are coming down these days. By land, air, and sea. They asked me why I haven't caught any. If they catch one first, I will be in trouble. They threatened me. Do you want to see me go down? Get out and get them. You better hurry up. Go get them! Right now! Get out right now! It's been days. Not a single soul has passed by. If I die here, they won't even find my body. Why did I step on a mine? In my next life, I will be a mine. Let me ask you a question. You said you didn't want to make the woman you love miserable. What does that mean? Tell me. It just probably slipped my tongue. I was still in shock. I don't remember. Look me in the eye. Be honest with me. I was out of my mind. You're such a handful. Do you like me? Do you like me? When I saw you for the first time, you were bathing in the mountain. And? I don't want you to be forced to marry me. Or anyone. Speak directly. I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I can live here all my life. Let me go. I won't tell anyone. I can promise. I know you don't want to marry me. Let me go back to my hometown. I miss my parents. I miss my brothers and sisters, too. Oh, my goodness! Why does it have to be right now? What's wrong? Soldiers are coming. Go hide yourself. -Don't resist. -Tie him up. I'm so sick of military life. Is that the teacher's home? Why? Are you going to arrest him? Why would we? It's just a formality. Oh, my. What are you doing here? Me? The teacher is sick. We're taking care of him. He's right. His fever is so high. -He just fell asleep. -Right. -He's asleep? -Yes. You shouldn't wake him up. Let me just check on him. -Wait. -Wait. -The door might be also asleep. -What? You're acting odd today. Me? There's nothing odd. Please. No. Oh, gosh. What's wrong? What's the matter? Sorry for the trouble. I hope you understand. Of course we understand. Excuse us now. Let's go. Where is she? Sun-mi. Are they gone? How can you laugh in this situation? I almost got killed. Gosh. You can go back now. I will walk you to the entrance. It's right there. All right. Sun-mi. Can we do it again? What? Actually, it was... my first kiss. It felt kind of strange. Can we try it again? We don't know what's going to happen. Let's do it once more. It will be a quick one. It feels weird. Are you okay? Are you okay? Comrade Sun-mi. Why do you look so tired? What are you doing here? I came because I missed you. Why would you miss me? If anyone misses you, shouldn't it be me? Considering what happened. Hey. I'm not interested in a sissy like you. What do you mean? Then why did you kiss me? What? At the mill, you kissed me. What's wrong with you? -You... -She doesn't want you, can't you see? Let me explain... If you keep coming here... What can I do? We will have to talk to the army officials. I'll be beaten up to death. You know that. Get him. What are you doing? Let go of me. Comrade Sun-mi. Why are you doing this? Comrade Sun-mi! Here, a young man who stepped on a mine, died with an honor. Jang-geun Jin I even wrote a note. I will die like a man now. This is it, Jang-geun. Wait. This is it! One, two... Oh, gosh! I almost died! What is it? Why doesn't it blow up? Oh, gosh. Why doesn't it blow up? It's supposed to blow up! I was standing on it for days! Why doesn't it blow up? Why? Multiplication and Division Do you have many friends in the upper village? I know everything. I even wrote to my parents. I told them I can't come home until the country is reunited. Are you staying here? What can I do? Ever since I saw that tunnel, they have been guarding me. Right? Dear brothers and sisters in South Korea. Here she goes again. I bet she's ugly. With that voice, she can't be pretty. Let me do my job. Close the door. It's so noisy. She herself must know it's a lie. -I'm getting hungry. -It's not like their leader is giving them any food. By the way, this voice sounds familiar. ...again. Every week... Oh, my. -Hey. -Yes? The rice cakes taste great. The meat turned out very nice as well. Hurry up and peel the onions. Prepare green onions, too. Pancakes are burning. Pull yourself together. Hello? Please help me. Help! Wait for me! Hello? CAPITAL BY KARL MARX You're a spy, aren't you? No. I'm a teacher, I swear. What are these things then? I heard the village was very remote, so I brought them with me. My goodness. Don't try to fool us. Where are all your books? Well... I wiped my ass... and made paper planes with them. You bastard! You caught one? Sir! Is this the guy? You little... He sure looks like a spy, right? That's what I thought so, too. Good job. Don't worry about a promotion. -You can even use the helicopter. -Thank you, sir. -Look at him. -Sir. What is it? I did a background check on him. He's a spy, right? Well... -Is everyone here? -Yes. Let's go. -Hurry up. -Okay. -We should get there before they do. -You're right. Oh, my. Why are you so startled? Are you going to hook up with South Koreans again? All right. You can talk over the food later. Let's set the table first. -Okay. -Okay. Hurry up, guys. Let's get started. Where is Sun-mi? She must be getting dressed. It takes some time. Should I go pick her up? He's such a gentleman. All right. You know the way, right? Where is the teacher going? He's going to pick Sun-mi up. Sun-mi? You can't send him alone. -Follow him. -Follow him. You go. -Hurry. -Go. No one is here. The chief is gone, too. The whole village is empty. What? Have they all left to go to North Korea or something? Search everywhere. -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. If I call the other soldiers, you will die. So will the villagers. If you marry me, I won't tell anyone about the tunnel or anything. What do you say? If you... If you get to know me, I'm a very strong man, too. If you marry me, you and the villagers can live. Everyone will be saved. So just marry me. I love you, Comrade Sun-mi. I want to live with you. I will protect you. I will take the secret to my grave. So please. Please, let me love you. Comrade Sun-mi. What is taking so... No! Don't make any sound. Come over here. Sit down. You bastard. You're a South Korean, aren't you? I'm... a North Korean. Mr. Gong. Who are you? Stop there! Stop! Stop right there! Stop, or I will shoot you! Stop! What the heck? Where is he? That bastard. Damn it. You're such a sissy. Can you really protect me? Hurry! Gosh. Mom. We wish you good health. I don't want to live long in a world like this. I would rather die. Thanks to you, the whole village gets to gather. Your 80th birthday party will be here, too. In this cave again? Mom. Be patient. If the country can't be reunified by political or military means, our village will take initiative. After that, we can finally have your 80th birthday party on the ground. It will take about 20 months. Come on. What is with you? Oh, gosh. Chief! Oh, my. -What happened? -What happened? Some... Is something wrong? Tea... -Sun... -Teacher? Sun-mi? They have been caught... They have been caught? -Hur... -Hur... Hurry? -Oh, gosh. -What are you trying to say? What's going on? You usually can understand me. North Korean soldiers are coming with guns. -North Korean soldiers? -With guns? Hurry up! LONG LIVE IL-SUNG KIM! LONG LIVE OUR LEADER IN-SUNG KIM! We might all die. Come with us. If we do? We can all live. If we survive this, we will finally be able to live together. You never know. There is no guarantee that we will survive there. Do you want to stay here and get killed? If you go back now, you will all be killed. You don't know that. Who set up that line and separated us? We dug this tunnel to meet our family. What is so wrong about it? If we go to south, you will be in danger, too. If we want to meet again, we have to remain alive. Dong-yeob is bleeding. -We have to decide quickly. -We will all die. They will come with guns. What are you waiting for? -Let's go back to our village. -Let's go. Take care. No. Damn it! Kill me before you go. Kill me! My goodness. Don't be a fool. We might all die. Do you think I can live after losing my family? Mom turned 70 today. If we separate today, when will I see Mom again? Jong-seok, Deok-yong. Take him to your village. I can't. -Kill me, too. Just kill me now. -Jong-seok... I can't let you go either. Me neither. Kill all of us first. What are you doing? Do you think it's easy for us? We don't want to go either. But we can't get killed. Honey, let's just go with them. We shouldn't separate again. Let's go with them. Come with us. No one in South Korea has noticed. Please come with us. I will follow Hyun-sik. We have to stick together no matter what. -Mom. -I will follow you. Come with us. -Mom. -Follow us. Mom! Mom! Let's go together. Let's go. I can't live -without you. -Let's go. I want to massage your legs -and scratch your back. -I would like that, too. -Mom. -I will stay with you. I will stay with you. Are you okay? We have no choice. Get on my back. -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. What about Sun-mi and Mr. Gong? -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. -One, two. Can we take a break? If you're tired, I will get off. One, two! One, two! One, two! How can you... What is that sound? Help! We're here! -Chief! -Help! We're here! Chief! Chief, we're here. Why did you block the way? Chief, we're here! Help! What did we do to deserve this? Why are you abandoning us? What did we do? Let us out. We're being chased. Chief, we're here! Please. Let us out. -What should we do? -What is this? What should we do? -They're coming. -I will keep you safe. I will protect you. -What should we do? -I will protect you. You bastard. We can't die like this. What is going to happen? North Korea is the best! North Korea is the best. What the hell? Freeze, or you will be shot. Do not move. Mr. Ma. -Well... -Mom. Chief. South Korea is the best! South Korea is the best! -The best! -The best! If we move, they will shoot us. South Korea... We shouldn't move. South Korea is the best! -South Korea is the best! -It's the best! It's the best! It's the best! It's the best! It's the best! It's the best! WE WELCOME NORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS. It sure feels great to be a general. Smile for the camera. Smile. Can we eat after this? You already ate. It was a while ago. Everyone, smile. AFTER RECEIVING SEVERE IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION AND SWEARING THEY WILL NOT MOVE ANYWHERE, THEY WERE SENT TO AN ISOLATED ISLAND. A FEW YEARS LATER... Are you thinking about your sister-in-law? I hope she's alive. What is she to you? You never think about your wife, but you always think of her sister. That damn teacher. Oh, gosh. Come on. It's been years. You can tell me now. Tell me what happened. The government told me to keep my mouth shut. Or I'm dead meat. The government, my ass. Well... Did you hook up with her once? There was a thing going on between you, -and you got caught by the teacher? -I swear to God I didn't. How could you say that? -Shame on you. -Fine. Why do you get so worked up? I wonder if my son is alive. He would have become a teacher, too. My goodness. I knew it. You? A master sailor? I was out of my mind. What was I thinking, giving birth to his kids? Hey. Are you sure you can live in South Korea? We can live as heroes in North Korea. You lied about being a teacher too, didn't you? I never graduated, but I did get in. See? My goodness. I knew it from the start. You ruined my life! What will you do? I can't continue like this. I'm turning back the boat. NORTH KOREANS CROSSED THE BORDER. Everyone, watch your feet. This tunnel you're walking in right now, it was found 27 years ago, in 1980. It's the largest and most threatening one that the North Korea has ever built. Be careful. If you look around, you can learn many things. But most of all, it reminds you of the brutality of battle that took place here at that time. Watch out. Take a look at these exhibits. Now follow me. This tunnel is 3km long in total and reaches 1,5km into South Korea. NORTH KOREAN DEFECTORS FIND A NEW HOME. We're surrounded by the sea. We can't even dig any tunnels. You should be grateful that we can all live together. Isn't it nice? The sea breeze is so refreshing. Exactly. We can have as much seafood as we want, too. I like it here. -You're right. -Still, there is no place better than your hometown. But we have no choice... but to live here. That's the way the cookie crumbles. At least we're alive. By the way, the chief never seems to... Subtitle translation by Min-jin Kim
