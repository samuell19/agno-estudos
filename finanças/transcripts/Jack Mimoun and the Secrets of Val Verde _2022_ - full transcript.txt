Mister? Do you hear me? Did you really go to that island? THE SECRETS OF VAL VERDE 2 YEARS LATER Vasco! Stop making a mess! THE MAN WHO SURVIVED HELL The stele was so heavy it took three days to reach the tomb. There, on April 21, 1997, a young archeologist on his first expedition discovered an object that revolutionized the march of History. Or at least transformed it. That young man... was me. This was the object. That's all? My boy, this signet ring, albeit tiny, bears the seal of the Assyrian Empire. It proves the Empire began a full century earlier than what the great historians thought. So, yes... that's all. The most minor objects sometimes tell the greatest stories. For my father, you were no mere assistant. Can I keep it? Of course. Finish with me what you two began 20 years ago. How long to plan an expedition? You're joking. Look at the cover. You see what I see, right? Who's this guy? This guy survived alone, with no resources for 3 months on a wild island in the Indian Ocean. Can you say as much? Yes, I can. But I doubt he could survive 3 months anywhere. Look, Jonas. This is proof! It's not proof. It's a hunch. Expeditions aren't planned on a hunch. Based on a hunch, James Cook discovered Australia, New Zealand, Hawaii... Yes, Hawaii. Where he was stabbed by natives. You don't just show up on a wild island like Val Verde. I'm sure of it. Your father was sure too. Following your dreams without thinking has a name: pure madness. It's too risky. I get it. I'll figure something out. Wait, Aurélie, wait! My name is Jack Mimoun, and I go on extreme adventures in the most dangerous places. Survival instinct is a question of life or death. To learn my techniques, watch "Jack Mimoun, Survivor of Hell'. FACE-OFF WITH DANGER Hear that? A baby caiman calling its mother. I better hurry or I'll be their family snack. You have to approach gently. Come on, kiddo. I'll release you. Don't worry. Every year, 800 tons of plastic are dumped into the Zambo. Into the Zamba. Fuck. Cut, cut, cut. Where's Fabrice? Your caiman's snoozing. Get the morphine out of his ass! It's not my fault. You wanted him sedated. - I asked for Volvic. - Sorry. Thanks. The jacket's tight. Can you let out the shoulders? You were perfect. Even the critter was impressed. At the least, what I saw will impact the world. Fabrice! Any news from Christelle? She's expecting. But Delphine is free. No, not Delphine. She almost ate my balls. Delphine, the chick from Toulouse? He wants me to take that hyena for my show. Not Delphine! Find me another. He'll find another. Fuck! Bunch of incompetents! Big crowd. Thanks. Now let's take some pictures. Hey, champ! We love you! I love you too. Sir, a picture please. Hello, my pleasure. Your son? What's your name? Ruben. Why are you so fat? So cute. Nice. What do you want to be? Adventurer! I'm a huge fan. I hope your mom is too. Here you go. Mr. Mimoun! Thanks, we had a great time. We'll never forget it. Mr. Mimoun! - We all have an adventurer... - Within! Never heard that one. The food's not bad. Mickey Mouse fanzine voted you 4th Most Loved Person. Sorry, I did everything I could. You know them, they wouldn't listen. By the way, we got 2 hours of jet ski tomorrow. We're going to a private beach. It looks like paradise. 4th place is fine, thanks. Well, I'm gonna go. You know where to find me. Good night. Mr. Mimoun? I had to say hello. Hello. Have a seat. I don't want to bother. It's no bother. Please, have a seat. It's crazy meeting you here. I love your show. I read your book. I'm a real fan. Not just of your adventures, but of your ecological messages. I really... admire you. I'm moved. Thank you, miss. Or is it "ma'am"? Miss. Miss... great. You're used to compliments. No... yes, yes. Sure I'm used to them. They're more about my survival instincts, my charisma. Or else my courage. But rarely for my stance on ecology, which is a shame because... I'd even say... it's a lifelong battle. It's my lifelong battle! Our lifelong battle. Thank you very much. Excuse me. What's this? A straw. A straw? Are you crazy? Know where it'll end up? In the ocean, where it'll suffocate a sea turtle. Forgive me, Mr. Mimoun. I forgive you. No worries. Will our planet? I'm not sure. - Same thing? - I don't drink. Same for her. The "Buzzard" cylinder When the baobabs grew again, the monkeys considered me family. I keep them with me. Here. Forever. One more round! No, thanks. This is fun! A lovely evening. May the night be lovely too. Sorry, I have to go. Don't leave. Let's meet again. You live on the island? I'm here for work. Meaning? I run an NGO. Green Touch. We build homes for homeless children. Those poor kids. It makes me sick. Tomorrow I visit the Saint-Paul mission. We have very little means. No social media presence. No one cares. It's inhuman. Thanks for the drinks. See you soon? Wait! I can accompany you. Accompany me? I'm off tomorrow. A round trip to the island. I'll post the pics we take. I'd love to help sick children. Homeless, not sick. What happens to the homeless? They get sick. That would be amazing. The second I saw you, I knew a great adventure was beginning. See you tomorrow. - Yes, Amélie. - Aurélie. Yes, Aurélie. Even better. Fuck. Excuse me? Can I have a straw? We know nothing about her. Her NGO comes up blank. Like I told you, she needs a boost. She needs us, the kids need us. - Thanks! - My pleasure, kiddo! She builds shelters for street kids. Here she is. Morning! Bruno Quézac, my manager. Miss... Jourdain. Aurélie Jourdain. Eco-friendly transport! Let's go. You sure this is a heliport? Don't worry. We're expected. I'm not worried. Bruno is. Mr. Bastos? PRIVERT PROPERTY DANGER OF DETH Don't move! Stay put! Identify yourself! The headset. You should've told me. Aurélie Jourdain. We spoke on Facebook. Strolling in a shooting zone? It's dangerous! Who are those assholes? Jack Mimoun, Survivor of Hell. I don't give a fuck. You have no business here! So listen up. Body search before takeoff. Follow me. What was that? Body search? You're good. Next! No comment. - Your turn. - No way. - It's the rule. - I said no way! Search yourself. Excuse me? You search yourself. He's a psycho. I'm clean. Follow me! We're not taking that. It's been through 6 wars. How about you? I haven't really been through any. But my uncle used to play Risk, remember? Jack, are you serious? That's a piece of junk. It's beautiful, I really love it. The peeling paint gives it a nice, vintage look. No, I'm not getting in. What's he up to? Come, Mr. Quézac! For the kids. Pain in the ass. I don't know even know the fucking kids. You're cruising for a bruising. You dare to stare. Good news. The bathroom's free. Ready for takeoff. Mr. Bastos? Door open. You prefer shut? Yes, in fact. Fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Shut! Is that better? Don't touch it. Neither of you. Anyway, I see you. This is taking a while. Is Saint Paul that far? It's wild. Yesterday we dined. Today we cross the ocean. Life is rich. Now that we're here, I'll be honest. I intimidate you? Relax. Behind the celebrity is a man. That's not it, but... I have flaws... Jack, let me talk. Isn't that island... Val Verde! Let me explain. I almost died there. - Just listen. - I won't go back! Initiating descent. No, don't. Turn around! What's going on? - No turning around! - Now! You hear me? Tell him to! - Tell him to! - Calm down. Heart attack. Do what I say! Really? He lost his cool. I followed procedure. As simple as that. If that's procedure, let's proceed. It's only normal. That'll stop him. Want one too? No, I'm good. What's going on? Were those gunshots? You wanted him alive. I obeyed. If orders change, find me and we'll talk it over. Just keep the info flowing. I brought breakfast. This is called kidnapping. 10 years, sweetie. Sorry. For the lie, the punch... Sorry? You're a fake fan. You lie about imaginary sick kids and kidnap me in a shitty chopper... It's a piece of shit! Thanks to you, we're in a deadly jungle! You're just "sorry"? I'm not a fake fan. Just a little. I admire your career. I owe this all to you. Bullshit. You found that bag here. It was my father's. I stitched this. Next to his heart. I'll stitch my foot to her ass. Father-daughter relationships are special. - Your father? - Léopold Diaz. One of the great treasure-hunters. He found Jupiter's Eagle. Want the bag? Here you go. It's settled. My father vanished 20 years ago without a trace. He had all his notes, I had no idea where he disappeared. Until I saw... this. My one request: show me where you found the bag. If he disappeared here 20 years ago, he's already dea... I'd have come across him. I know my father's dead. It's not him I'm after. I'm after what he was after. Olivier Levasseur. AKA: "Buzzard". The notorious French pirate, right? All right. For years... Buzzard and his admirals wreaked havoc on the seas. He reaped the most loot in the history of piracy. But one day, he got his hands on a masterpiece. A sword encrusted with diamonds and gems stolen from a Maharaja. The sword's value is... incalculable. More than all his treasures combined. One day, Buzzard and his men were caught and killed without revealing the treasure's location. Except... Buzzard, just before they hanged him, threw a coded message to the crowd shouting: "My sword to whoever finds it!" The message pinpoints the treasure. For ages, it obsessed explorers all over. But my father cracked the code. Your father's a pirate? One day he hopped into his plane without saying goodbye. Now I know where he went. So we help find a sword? Whoever finds it becomes a legend. Great show, bravo. Congrats to the cast. I'll double your fee for a ride back. We have enough supplies for 4 days. I'll triple it. Sorry, miss. The triple means about 120 euros. One more thing about my father! Shut up. Fucking swords and Buzzards. Shoot her kneecap! Bruno, no! Sorry, it's... the adrenaline. Problem? No, the problem is I can't find them. Find what? The keys to the chopper. I had them at breakfast. I had them when we flew. Same when I killed the scorpion and when she talked about her pirate dad. He's reciting his day? I had them during flight maneuvers. He's armed. He can recite his whole week. Fuck, he has them! Come! That son of a bitch! See it? Wait. This is a nightmare. I'll wake up. It's too quiet. Quiet is a bad sign. Run! Fuck this! Wait for me! See you down there. No way! Forget about her! Who gives a fuck? It's over now. Bye-bye, lunatic! Why don't you shoot? No ammo, just our bare hands. Remember to bite first. And never turn your back to them. If you do, you're dead. Let's bypass them to reach the chopper. Let's try this instead. I'm suffocating. Careful. What a dumbass. He lost everything. I can't stand him anymore. If we head back to the chopper, can you restart it? Anything's possible. I can maybe tinker with the starter. But the carburetor dates back to before 1970. Before the 70s means there's a junction box. In itself, it's possible if I can juice up the battery. Interrupting me won't help. I'm asking a question. Here's the answer. - Okay? - Sure. To technical questions, technical replies. For me, 1 + 1 = 2. I haven't the gift of ubiquity. - What? - Ubiquity. By that, I mean... It's not hard. If I can unblock the engine clutch... If we make it to the chopper, can we leave? Will it start, yes or no? Worth a try. There we go! We'll use the sun to situate ourselves. You can't leave me. You're no mere survivalist. You're like my father. An adventurer. In the noble, romantic sense. I'd dreamt of meeting a man like you. Damn left-handed machete! I'm thirsty! In what surroundings was the bag? In surroundings... that were here, in the surroundings. The distance as the crow flies? Depends on the crow. For sure, old crows fly slower than young ones. By the way, do you know the size, I mean the wingspan, of an albatross? Between 6 and 7 feet! So the albatross is really... the Big Guy in the Sky. I wonder how much an albatross costs. I got it. Very good. Very reassuring. We're on the right path. Why won't you say where you found it? I need to get my bearings, okay? I was alone last time. Concentration-wise, it was easier. It's very different in winter. It's winter. Nope. In the southern hemisphere, it's winter. See my mittens? My ski hat? Not winter. He's right. So please let me concentrate. Merry Christmas, Aurélie! He's right. He has my support. Is he well, or...? Listen. You came looking for him. So trust him to do his thing. Winter, southern hemisphere... Relax, I'm fine! It's all good. I cleared the trail. The Condor. My father's plane. Condors are mighty too. I said we were close. It was in the cockpit? What? The bag. The bag, no. I found it there, just below. - There must be a clue inside. - Really? Why... She's climbing up. Unbelievable! Come down, it's dangerous. Aurélie, visualize your way up. First lesson of survival: vertigo is a mindset. Take off your shoes. With this humidity, feet need to breathe. What happened? This? Nothing. A propane tank. A little tip: don't smoke near propane tanks. I've had it rough too. Appendicitis. I was 25. It cost me dearly. You didn't have health insurance? You tried cutting corners. But when it rains, it pours. You get no breaks. My ex-brother-in-law was a victim of insurance fraud. He's still paying. For you, words are alphabet soup. Luck of the draw. Find anything? There's nothing. An old valise and some vines, no more. I've managed to decipher the Buzzard's message. The following text is an exact transcription. Come down! What's the asshole up to? A tarantula. Ten minutes from now, you're cooked. Okay, enough. Enough already! Fetishist! - Pervert! - Shut the hell up! It's back. What's wrong? Come! It's now or never! Come, it's dangerous! Come on, hurry! It's gonna fall. Take my hand. I got you. I'm stuck. You can make it. My foot's jammed. You're stuck! Bruno! Bastos! Come help... Mr. Bastos! Mr. Quézac! Shheck your shhoes fery sshharefully. Too humid, I can't. Can you tell him what you told me? Yeah, I was saying for me, family means a mom and dad. Not that, the other thing. Yeah, September 11th. I'm persuaded there are gray areas. Focus or this'll never end. The sword thing. Oh yeah, about old Buzzard's sword. I've heard it 20 times. Dozens of guys come to the region to find the big treasure and leave empty-handed. It's systematic. If you want my opinion, it's all baloney. A fairytale for nincompoops. She's full of shit too. With her phony father story. Says me. It's dark, I can't do this haphazardly, I'm not a magician. See better now? Because you had a lighter? We're on an expedition. Bare minimum. For me, but maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not. Here's exactly what Buzzard said: Those out for my fortune will find it on Val Verde Island. Behind its highest walls, behind the highest waterfall, a path leads to the heart of the mountain. Where the sword awaits. In the deepest recess. Aurélie. I built a fire. I'm sorry, it's silly but... I shouldn't cry. This is a life-changing moment. I guess for you, it's business as usual. I've traveled the world, but what we're living is pretty exceptional. You always wanted this? Adventures. Since you were a kid? I wanted people to be interested in me. Like all kids, right? My dream was to discover a treasure. You're making it come true. Positive vibes. It looks that way. Find yourselves a room! To fuck. That one, I got. Actually... I'll apologize in advance: I snore. I better tell you now: I'm feeling a little nauseous. Listen... At least we're bonding. I don't think that's a good idea. First time was in Kuwait. The guys in my unit and I were like brothers. One day we fell into a trap. Surrounded, like rats. I just had time to hide in a freezer. I was the sole survivor. Second time was in the Sahel. We were there on a simple recon mission. We got caught in a desert storm. I had a stroke of genius. I built myself... with what I had on hand... a camel's bladder... an air pocket. The others all ended up with lungs full of sand. And the third time was... in Limoges. Fabrice's wedding. Me and three buds were groomsmen. We'd planned a giant fireworks. The final flourish finished its trajectory in a propane tank. I was in the restroom. The salmon gave me the runs. The fourth time... We get the gist. You may all die tomorrow. And I'll be here, as usual, alone. Okay. Goodnight, everyone. Mushrooms! We won't eat that. First lesson in survival: overcome disgust. Your book mentions Sporis Malvea. She's right. They're Sporis Malvea. An unusual mushroom that... Paralyzes the nervous system if inhaled. Yes, throw that shit away. Negative. I'm behind on my vaccines. You're barking up the wrong tree. Listen how vaccines work. They inject microchips into you and track you with phones, with satellites and radar. You fall into it. These are delicious. 100% natural, pure organic. Better than vaccines. It reeks! Very good. I think we have a problem of the physical kind. It will just take a few minutes. I can't feel my legs, thanks to your mushrooms. Stop complaining or I'll slap you. This leads to the waterfall? The map in your book is reliable? I'm not a cartologist. Cartographer. In South America it's cartologisto. Sorry I'm bilingual. I'm so hungry. And thirsty too. Know what I'd like to eat? A double cheese pizza. With a nice cold glass of sparkling water. And for dessert, three scoops of ice cream. Vanilla, raspberry and rum... Three scoops. Vanilla, raspberry, I'm in pain... And rum raisin. It's my favorite. Please... shut up. Just shut your mouth. I'm fed up. I don't like verbal violence. Are you okay? - Need a break? - No. No, I'm good. It's the group. I think about the group. The group must hydrate or it'll be dehydrated. Bad for the group. Dizzy group, non-existent colors... Wait, quiet! I really hear it. A source! A source! There's a source. First rule of survival: drink water! Yes? What? We're sinking! Shit! I'm stuck! I can't move! I'm stuck! See you on the other side. We're gonna die! Because of your sword crap! Help! Jonas! Why are you here? I lost your father. I can't lose you. I'm so happy I found you. Jack Mimoun? Survivor of Hell? Know him? Jonas worked with my father. We're old friends. Like a big brother? How did you know? When you fixate on something, not even I can stop you. So you're not that close. They're not close. I have myself to blame for letting you alone. She wasn't alone. Fuck! Listen... I don't know who you are, but we owe you. My timing was... perfect. Now we'll escape this hell. I'd lost faith. We're not going back. We're so close. Still running on empty? You're incredible. Your father would be so proud. So what have you learned? To go behind the highest walls. Behind the biggest waterfall. Are you crazy? Don't spill the beans to just anyone. I'm here to help. And for Aurélie. We're all here to help. And we're also all here for... Jack, he just saved our lives. I think he's trustworthy. I wasn't sinking. Look what I brought. State-of-the-art radar. Shot off faster than expected. You realize what you did? I could have been wounded. Come on, relax, it's all good. It's under control. No worries. I didn't come to be bawled out. I'm the only one with a weapon, and I get yelled at. By the way, when you got in, did you happen to come across a keychain with a RK-45 tank? Been like this from day one? I know, but it's... A miracle you're still alive! Put that down! My fault. I recognize my mistakes. Put it down. I didn't expect that one. Unbelievable. How have you survived? Jack knows the island. He brought us to the Condor. You brought them to the Condor? I'll bring you to the treasure. Trust me. He misunderstood. We're leaving. We're packing it in. How else can I put it? I lead the way. This is my territory. Follow me. Amazing island. So much biodiversity. So unspoiled. It's stunning. Look at that euphorbia! They're huge. Make yourself an herbarium. Look! On your right. A weeping sequoia. Not at all. It's just an ordinary palm tree. That kind exists only here. You can find them on the Riviera. Nice, Antibes... So we can agree to disagree. So tell me, Mr. Mimoun. Three months here must have been tough. Did you read my book? Yes, I did. You know, you lose track of time in survival mode. You're telling me. I spent a year alone in Antarctica. Antarctica. Your deadliest predator: penguins? No, Mr. Mimoun. Emperor penguins. Penguins live in the Arctic. - Can I see? - No thanks. Look at this. Keroma root. Thirst-quenching, high in protein. It's all over. You never said it's edible. Yes, I did. Jean-Marc? I filter. I don't listen to everything. Bruno? Yes, for me, he said it. Nice and crunchy. Good, right? I had it before. It tastes like... Earth. Not that great, it's... What's wrong? It's your fucking root! Lie down. It's burning. Let me look. Fuck! Bastos, suck it out. I won't suck the whole jungle. Move! I'll take care of it. Aurélie, it's me. Listen to me. You hear me? Put yourself in LPR. Lateral position... for recovery. LPR. Cut the crap! Do you trust me? I'm slicing open the wound. Hold on tight. There you go! Once more! You're a psycho! You could have hit a vital organ! I feel better. He didn't even use Betadine. You have to walk now. I've had it Psycho-Surgeon! It happened to me in Liberia. A child soldier... That's irrelevant. He's a danger! Come... lean on me. Just a little more... Great footbridge, Buzzard. Watch out! The bridge is in such bad shape, one of us should go first. In my opinion, we've shared enough nice experiences. More would be gluttony. We just need balance and caution. In gym class, I was queen of the beam. It shouldn't be you. Very brave of you. Fitting for the Survivor of Hell. I believe in you. Let's go. Take it easy. One foot, then the other. Nice and slow. You're in no rush. Hey, you! If this fails, you'll have to answer. To... To France. Hear that, Mr. Mimoun? France is watching you. Relax, you'll manage. Step by step. Fear exists to be overcome. I'm gonna die! I'm gonna die! Look at me. Help me! Vertigo is a mindset. Spare me the bullshit advice. I'm coming for you. Hold on good. Try hoisting yourself up. - I can't! - You can! I can't! No, he can't. I can't breathe! Fuck. Think of your fans! You're the Survivor of Hell! Don't you realize I never set foot here? I lied! I'm not an adventurer! 2 YEARS EARLIER Stay grouped together! Go on, get moving! Remember, if we don't get back too late, it's Samba night! I woke up one day a hero! What could I do? Nothing I could do. I'm sorry. All of this is your fault. You and your tits got us here! Listen, Bruno. I understand the situation and I'm part of it. Meaning what, Hillbilly? What's with the gun? Wanna shoot me? Come on, let's do it! Take it! 10th time! Pull the trigger! Get it over with! So? I don't hear the pop! You have balls the size of split peas! You also piss me off! You piss me off! Whoever you are, too! I'm outta here! I'll find my way alone. Goddamn fucking losers! Not happy. Listen, we're all under the shock. We all express it differently. And that's normal. What the hell are you up to? When a comrade falls, we give a final salute. My last three bullets. If we run into a wild animal... we'll fight it head on. It's okay now. Just step over the broken slats. Good. Keep it up. Hang onto the ropes. I can't. It's time to be brave. Give it your all. Gather your forces. Only you can do it. Don't step on the green slats. I'm color blind. Bruno! Sharing this experience is wonderful. You're realizing your dream. Know the difference between stalactites and stalagmites? We couldn't give a flying fuck. Careful! You okay? I can't take it anymore. This is endless. What's he doing? I don't know. Looking for his keys. We never came here. Trust us. Can you do something other than that? Like help us. I have no problem helping. You got it wrong. What'll you do with these rocks? A fortified castle? You fascinate me. Thank you very much. You're equally lovely. It's not the death I wanted. Piling up rocks 50 meters underground. A Porsche Cayenne in my garage and I die like a Chilean miner. Go figure. I'll be dying too. There are worse things than death. What a pearl. Can you elaborate for a sec? What's worse than death? I see something! Survivor of hell! Underwater passage Buzzard's lair A royal sword should be much more... royal. No, you mustn't always believe what legends say. Believe me, their historical value is the same. Can we go? We found the treasure. I found it. Fuck, a skull and crossbones. An underwater tunnel can't be... I'm screwed. You're a Nazi? He's a Nazi. They don't kid around. Stop that. Communist? Boko Haram? Daesh? - Al Qaeda? - Shut up! I'll tell you a story. About a young man with dreams. Dreams of adventure, discoveries. He studied for years at the best schools. Then one day, he met an adventurer. A real one. Who writes History with a capital "H". Big "I". It starts with an "I". No, Jean-Marc. "History" starts with an "H". It's called a silent "H". Shut up! So, this young man met his mentor. Thanks to the young man's research, together... they decided to go after Olivier Levasseur's coded message. Who is this one now? I knew a Levasseur. His first name wasn't Olivier. It was Thierry. A real nice guy. What in "Shut up" don't you understand? When I speak, the deadbeats shut up! You shut up too! Look at me. Do you understand? So who is Levasseur? We don't know. Buzzard. He can't say "Buzzard"? Help! Enough! Where was I? Now I lost my train of thought. His mentor... had promised him had sworn to him, that the day he deciphered the message, they'd set off together to find Buzzard's sword. Together. When he deciphered it, the mentor decided to go solo. Betraying the young man. Your father betrayed me. When I saw you really had a lead on your father, and that you'd be carrying on his mission, I realized that... no way would I be betrayed again, by his daughter. This discovery is mine. It belongs to me. It's my treasure! And you show up with a team of duds? With this pom-pom boy? And a sociopath? And that TV clown of yours, that big fat butterball? That Mimoun? Did he save your life? I did! I did! Since you love your Jack, you can go join him. Coming, Aurélie! I'm too short. So? Fucking piece-of-shit Nazi! I need help. Come, Jack. I'll catch you! Come! Here you are, my friend! Freaking idiot. You're alive! He's here! I have something for you. Not enough for you to forgive me, but... It's better than nothing. You saw him? You've gone further than him. I'm sure he'd be proud. It suits you. I can tell you're lying. Funny, usually no one does. Guys... This round's on me. - Here. - Thanks. Like they say, "Enough for 1, enough for 4." I gave you a life lesson. Can you repeat that? I gave a life lesson. No, before. Enough for 1, enough for 4. Enough for 1, enough for 4... There were four of them. Four pirates. Buzzard and his admirals, right? 3 admirals? Yes. They were inseparable. Grew up, plundered and died together. Pirates trusted no one. Come and see! One for everyone. Count of three. One... two... three! I shouldn't be doing this. I'm extremely moved. No, I was thinking... Holy Moses! This place reeks of riches! Money can't buy happiness, but it can. The Mona Lisa. I should've taken my car. We came for the sword. We're not looters. For sure? We're not looters... When we iced Gaddafi, we didn't leave empty-handed. Not looters, my ass. Good job, Dad. You found it. Thanks, Léopold. Thanks Jean-Paul. Léopold. He's not here. Makes no difference. Crazy, I find secret passageways now! This isn't bad at all. Look at this. It suits me. They won't have XXXL. Genghis Khan's coat. It doesn't matter. I'll change the label. I found the way out! I found it. You're a lucky man, Jack. Surviving such a fall. Give me the sword. Negative, no way out. I knew it. We'd need a truck crane. At the least, a winch. We got nothing. No. We have that. Come now, let's not make this more ridiculous. France no longer watches you. Give me... that sword. You outwitted Léopold and me. Shame no one will ever know. Now ends your fake claim to fame. What? What will you do? There's no killer in you. I know. Stop breathing! Follow me. I'll find you! Oh... shit. Last time I come here. First and last time. Cute couple, huh? What? Nothing, just a fleeting thought. Sorry. It wasn't the idea. I'm overly self-confident. I'm sorry. That's not it. You never know but... It's normal. We're going home.
