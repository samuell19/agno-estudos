Uh, no, I was on my skateboard actually. Oh, no. You were wearing a helmet, though? No. So I was coming up to the T-junction. She was coming this way, and, uh, we both went it at the same time. - She went straight into me. - Oh, into your leg. - Yeah and my lower back. - Oh, my goodness. So did she get out and help you? Uh, yeah, she did, actually. And then she drove me to the hospital. But the most annoying thing was on the way there, she got her phone out again and just started calling her husband. What? She was on the phone when she went into you and then she got her phone out again? - Yeah. - That's ridiculous. So what... How long ago was this? Uh, six, seven months ago, maybe? Yeah. So is it all sorted out sort of legally and... Oh, yeah. I did actually get some letter from her, uh, lawyers or something or something, but basically her money's landing in my account tomorrow, which is good. You mean the, sort of the, uh, insurance? The compensation. Yeah, I've been trying to tell you that. Yeah, either way, though, you're now looking at a very rich Tom. - Really? - Oh, yeah. Oh, go on and tell us how much. - Wow. - Mum, I told you that. - You just didn't listen. - What's wrong with asking? - Stop it. - Uh, it's fine. I'm getting a whopping 25Gs. - Oh, yeah. - Nice one. So that's going to make the papers, then? That will probably be in the local paper. So when I look at it, I'll be able to say, "I know that young man." Yeah, exactly. - Um... - Hey I'll get it. - No, its cool. I'll get it. - No, no, it's fine. It's get... My leg's getting stiff anyway. I should probably move about, shouldn't I? So... - You sure? Hey, honestly, I... - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't mind, seriously. You sure? Hello. - All right. - Yeah. Who was that? Uh, that... That was just, uh, some homeless guy who was saying something about, uh, he... he got... basically got done for some crime he didn't commit or something, now he's homeless and he's just coming, you know, round asking for money and stuff like that. And he's going door to door? Yeah. I mean, I did ask him why he's not down at the beach or anything, but you know... - Yeah, that doesn't sound right. - That doesn't sound right. That sounds weird. You sure he wasn't your dealer? - What are you talking about? - What? - What are you on about? - Well, come on! Yeah, she is right actually. You think... You think I wasn't smoking dope at your age and... and had to buy it and crikey, I wasn't born yesterday. True. Yeah. - Dope though? - What's wrong with that? Well, you know, we just don't call it that anymore. - What is it, then? Weed? - Well, not really. - Do you still call it joints? - Do we? Do you... Is that what you call them? Yeah, Mum. We do. I mean, you know, I miss the old joint now and again, - I'd like a smoke now and again. - Okay, Mum. Finished your tea now, haven't you? I miss it. I'll see you when I am done here. I'll give you a hand. No, please. My cast is down there. - Hey, if that's okay. - No, not really. Okay, good. Huh? - Oh, my mum! - What? I'm just glad she didn't stay for the joint. Fuck. Yeah, I wasn't expecting that to be fair, but yeah, it is a good thing she didn't stick around to see what I really got. What does that mean? What? What you really got. What does that mean? Oh, yeah, let me show you. What have you done? Oh, it is in here. Its in this one. Oh, fuck. - What? - Tom, what are you doing? Just a bit of gak. Its fine. Yeah, but... Fuck.

It's been like two years, hasn't it? You know? I think the last time it might have been when you were... - Just started at the pub. - Yeah, yeah. Good memory, Danny. What are you sulking about? I'm just not a big fan of the name. Tommy calls you that all the time, doesn't he? He does. He can do things like that, can't he? Does he do that stuff at work? Well, not to me, because we're best mates, but he can. Yeah. I thought I was his best mate. You know what I mean? Just like best mates at work. - Not anymore though. - What happened? I moved to work at the police station now. Are you on the, uh, the 999 calls? No, no, not like that. - Just like, boring admin stuff. - My aunt was a Police officer. Why'd you say it was boring? It's admin. I feel like everyone says it's boring. And if you like it, it doesn't matter if people think it's boring, you know. Fuck them. Thanks. No worries. What is your aunt's name? I might know her. I doubt it. She, um... She died a few years ago. God, that's really shit. Thanks for not saying, sorry. You know when, uh, you know, when people say so and so died, people just say, sorry. People die and it sucks. I am sorry you have to live with this idiot though. You're right, it is cold. You got a football? I need a piss. Right. Well, lets fucking do it then. - Okay. - After the piss. Hmm, got the ball. Eight, nine, ten, ele... That was a record. I think I've got it. - So where did you go? - When? When you went travelling. Um, well it was like a road trip kind of, Across the U.S. Bit of Canada as well, which is yeah, it was nice. Yeah. What was your best bit? Um, what, like my favorite place? Yeah. California, probably. Uh, San Diego was nice. LA. Probably Venice Beach. We spent a lot of time there. Yeah, I love Venice Beach. Oh, you've... I didn't know you've been. Yeah, it was like a childhood dream of mine. So, had to go. That's the, uh, same as me and Tom. We used to speak about it. - Dan, you okay? - Fuck. - Yeah, yeah. - You alright, mate? - You alright? - Yeah, yeah. I'm good. I'm fine. Thank you. Yeah, I'm good. - No, no, no, I'm good, I'm good. - Let's have a look. Um, hey, do... Where was the toilet again? Where did you say? Just by, um, the angel statue. Yeah, that was it, um... - Are you sure? - Yeah, no, I'm... Honestly. Yeah, yeah, I am fine. Could you keep an eye on my stuff because I'm bursting now. - Keep an eye on it? - Yeah, yeah. Just my bike - and my bag and stuff. - Okay. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Cheers Yeah, but we're gonna go up to the field in the bit? Great. Cool. We... What about, have you not got any keys? Oh. - Hey, how you doing? - Alright? What? Where the fuck did you go? We came straight here, didn't we? - Hmm. - Yeah. Why? You asked us to look after your stuff. Yeah and you said see you later, didn't you? I said see you in a bit. What's the difference? What made you think that I wanted you to take my bike and leave me to walk home? It took me 25 minutes. My mistake. Hey, Dan. Tommy was telling me about his party. Are you going to go? Well, I mean, it's... It's in my house, isn't it? It's our house, Danny boy. You know what I meant though. - Oh, no. I'm... I'm good. Thanks. - No, he's given up, actually. Oh, why? Uh, I think he reckons it makes him lazy or something. No, not lazy. Just, uh... Yeah, but isn't it just like unproductive or something. Yeah. Yeah. Sort of. Unproductive. Like I, don't not like being able to get up for work or go for long bike rides and stuff. You know? I go to work and I go on long bike rides. Well, I mean, it's easy for some, isn't it? Are you trying to say you're better than us? No. What? No, that's not what I meant to say, like... I mean like I used to smoke a lot. I mean me and Tom used to smoke after school a lot, you know? You went to school together? - Oh, yeah. - Wow. What? Well it's just quite a long time to stay friends with each other. Haven't you? He's... He's still just upset that he got hit in the head by a football, aren't you? You should see how upset he gets when he loses as well. No, it's fine, that's just who you are, Danny boy. I swear he hates that name. No, he loves it really. You wanna see how upset he gets when he loses? - What are you talking about? - Oi, come on. You and me, race across the field. - Tommy. - No, I'm good. Thank you. Please don't. Alright to the other side of the field and back, yeah? Go on, you go on the bike. I'll run. - Alright, quickly. - Yeah. Yeah. - Alright. Okay. Three. - Okay, I've got to... - Two, one! - No, wait, there's... Wait. That's unfair. There's stuff. I've just... Eh? Oh, shit, man. What? She's fucking taken my grinder. Ah, fuck. Hey. - Have you been in the shower? - What shower? And? Yeah, but is your parent's were lined with mould? What mould? Mate. The... The shower is covered in... That toothpaste stuff that goes around the edge, it's covered in mould. God, what's that stuff called, the toothpaste stuff? - Silicone. - Silicone. The silicone is covered in mould. I thought the landlord was sorting this. Look, I may have phoned ahead out about that. Oh, okay. Alright. What did he say? Well, she said, it's fine. If we don't want that service included, then we can opt out of it. Service included? It's covered in mould. Well, you know, I just thought after we did the kitchen up and everything and that cost us a huge amount of money, didn't it? I didn't want to, you know, pay for the fucking bathroom too. - Mate, you're rich. - This... This was before I got all that money from the car crash. Oh, God. Mate, the shower is one big, mouldy, dirty thing. Look, okay. I thought we could maybe do a bit of DIY together as well or something? DIY? Yeah, you know, it could be quite fun. We can head to the shop in the dials. Pick up the bits we need. Come back. - Have a day of it. - Tom, I've got work, mate. And what shop are you talking about in the dials? Yeah. So you walk past those big wheely bins and then at the roundabout and it's there, pretty much. - No, it isn't. Where? - You know, there's that hill - that goes up? It's on that. - Mate, all hills go up. Alright, yeah, fairs. Don't you trust me? It is there. I promise you. God, I'd have to push the work back. Alright. - Whoa man, what you doing? - Chill. - What are you doing? - I'm going to go gut it. Then we'll leave. Alright? Relax. God. That was like 10 years ago that that happened. You need to just get over it. Oi, Spoonsy. - You alright, boss? - Yes. What are you saying, man? You good? Not much, bruv. What you up too? Uh, not a lot of man. Uh, to be fair actually just got back from the West Country. - Yeah? - Little excursion munching on some mushies for a week with a mate. - Sick! - Yeah. What about yourself?

Do you guys need a bit of cash? - Yeah? - You sure? - No? - Thanks. No, we're good. - No, okay, no. - Alright. Alright. Um, yeah, that's fine. I'll get it. Alright, cool. Right. If I'm, do you wanna give me a hand then, I'm getting it, right? Oh, I'll just... Yeah. Alright. Give me two seconds. I'll be right there. Alright, cool. Alright. - See you. - See you in a bit. See you. Listen man. Big party, my place. - Is it? You know. - Yeah, it's gonna be a mad one. Honestly. Bring your dog, bring your ruck sack, bring your clothes, bring your friends. - Oi, sick. - Yeah. It's going to be a ting. Oh, a lot of post. - Oh, one sec. - What? Gotta add these up, um. You not just do that in your head? Well, I need to confirm it with a calculator first. I'm not that great on the spot. You're not that good off the spot though, are you? What? What? Doesn't matter. Don't worry. Alright. This, we can't use shower till we silicone the shit out of it? Uh, it usually has to dry for a while. What does the thing say? - What thing? - The tube. The tube we just bought. Cool, it's got good weight. - Uh, it says... - Yeah. - Yeah. - What? What is that? It's 12 hours. So, 12 hours to dry. - Yeah, 12. - Yeah. Well, you better crack on with it then. What, whilst you stink of shit. Yeah, probably. What, like... Like dog shit? No, no, you good. Don't worry. You good. Oh. What? Do we really need that? I thought we could play some music. We're doing a job though. It's not... It's not a job though, is it? It's called a DIY job, isn't it? Yeah, but it's not like work, that's what I mean. Alright. Okay. Um. So take this. - Hey. Take that. - Hmm. Alright. - Alright, you need to... Hey! - Yo. Take that. You need to dry behind the back of here. - Oh, the rim there, yeah? - The rim, yeah. - Yeah. - Uh, and then once that's dried, that's where you put the silicone stuff in, yeah? - Okay. - Okay? It's mad. This thing's got four gigabyte on it. - Can you believe it? - Yeah, it's insane. Like a thousand songs on it, man. - That's amazing. - Yeah, I got it off my brother. How old is that thing? - What this? - Yeah. Uh, 4th Gen. So I guess that would make it somewhere... Between the 3rd and the 5th Gen? - Yeah, maybe, yeah. - Yeah. Alright, you ready? This is a banger. Uh, hold on. Not that one. Okay, this one, this one. I wonder if it means eight minutes. Like actually... What are you doing? I've dried it. - You can't. You've dried it all? - Yeah, touch it. Alright, uh, cool. In that case, uh, I've kind of used most of it, there's a bit left. - So you take that. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. And then what you need to do is dry around the back of it. Sorry, not dry. Um, squeeze that in the back of it. - The silicone stuff, so... - "Squeeze it in the back of it." - Yeah, right, you focus. - Yeah. And then keep your arm quite nice and straight like that. - Yeah. - And then kind of like... - Yes, sir. - Okay. - Sorry. - And I'm going to try and... That's fine. Have you used most of this already? Yeah, it's like... There's... There's enough left though. I've done... You've done that back bit already? Yeah. Whilst you were - faffing about. - Fairs, Dan. That's a nice job, bro. By the way, I've been meaning to ask how many people do you think can fit in this place? Uh, I don't know. Six or seven? Maybe at a push. In the whole house? What do you mean in the whole house? In the whole house I mean, like, you know, how many people you think can fit in this place? Oh, I don't know. I mean, it wouldn't be that hard to guess, would it? You just do like... -Well, like, -Really I'm not sure, mate. Our bedrooms are basically the same size, aren't they? So you do one bedroom plus one bedroom. Kitchen's just a little bit bigger. So maybe like, one bedroom plus one bedroom plus one bedroom? Oh, mate, 200. I don't know, probably like, 200, a couple of hundred. 200. Fuck. Yeah, but that would be like at a push. So it'd be a tight squeeze. Okay. Done. Finished it, its all. You can't... What do you mean? You can't possibly... Oh, Tom. Mate, you've gotta finish this. You've gotta finish this properly before it dries. It's a mess. It's a mess. Look. It's fine, me and my brother used to do jobs like this all the time before he became a smack-head. No one in their right mind would pay for that job. It's a mess, mate. Look at it. It's fine, look, once it dries all you have to do is you just sort of sculpt it. What are you talking... No, it's the opposite of that. You have to get it done before it's dried. It says that on this. - No, I don't think so. - It's a mess. Look at it. It's a state. Mate, you really are obsessive about this shit, you know? Mate, I've... Look at it. Take a look at it. It's an absolute state. Look at it, honestly. And also, I'm not obsessive, by the way. That's normal. It's fine, that's just who you are, man, you know, you just... that's the way you think about things, isn't it? You know, you sort of do like, how many people could fit in this room. You know? How long would that take to walk? How much food would it take to fit into that Tupperware thing? - How much... - Why would you ask me about how many people can fit into this house? For the housewarming party. 200 people? Tom! Well, okay, obviously, look, I'm going to subtract like 50 or 60 people off that estimate. Mate, you don't even know that many people. - I know, like a hundred people. - There's absolutely no way I'm allowing that many people into this house. Well, I need to shit, so get out. We're still doing the job, mate. What are you talking about? - Tom? Oh, for Christ sake. - Come on, get out. I need a poo. - Alright? - Hey. We're talking about one the biggest investigations. Did you just turn that off? Right here on our doorstep. Oh, the laptop? Yeah, did you just... You just turned it off, right? So, you knew I turned it off. Yeah, what... What do you mean? So why did you ask? Would you mind just turning it back on? I was trying, you know, catch up on the news. Ooh, you've done the washing up. - Oh, yeah. Come, have a look. - Nice one. - Come and have a look. - Sweet. Wow. Cheers. It's a good job. Hey! Thank you. Nice. Drinking, talking, plundering. Of course, we don't have to kill. - Let's get this straight. - Sit here? - Alright. Breakfast? - Yeah. Looks good. Oh, it's the, uh... Look, man, I do feel, you know, a bit guilty about what went down yesterday. You know, I feel guilty, I know you're not guilty. - That's the main thing of you. - Alright, thanks. But what about my money? What money? Could we turn the radio off? Oh, your money. Yeah. Yeah, of course. - Don't worry about that. - Just whilst, you know, whilst we're talking and I'm sitting here. Look, I'm gonna run out to shop, I told you, man, like, I do feel guilty, I keep telling you that. And yeah, I'll get your fucking money out. You know? I know I didn't do a very neat job at it and I'm not a very neat guy, but you know? I think... Yeah. Okay. That's it. I'm not a neat guy but but I'm a bit of a neat friend at least, aren't I? A neat friend. It just worked with what I was trying to say, didn't it? Oh, what's your fucking problem, man? - Nothing. - Come on. Just want get the money stuff sorted, you know? Right, yeah, about that, you gotta remind me of how much it is that I'm in debt to you by, because yeah, I didn't write it down. I thought you got that written down? I mean, yeah, I didn't but... You know, you kept receipts though, right? Didn't you? Well, it wasn't taken lightly, right? Certainly, it wasn't. Can we turn the news off? Hello? Why do you need the laptop and the radio on at the same time? What, what you on about? It's crazy. Michel's going to go down. - Oh, fucking hell, man. - Are you fucking deaf? You've got the news playing out the fucking radio and the laptop. And you're outside. I think this is becoming an obsession. You know? It's not good. It's not good for you. It's not good for anyone. It's driving me fucking mad. And I'm talking like that 19th century style of madness, yeah? ...with unwavering control... Fuck me. How could anyone listen to that much news? Christ! Good thing it's plastic. Alright? Alright. Um. I was going to, um... - What's up? - Oh. - Hey. - Hey. What you doing? I'm on a run. Oh, I thought you were up early. Fuck, did I wake you up, man? No, no. No, I, uh, I... I just thought you'd, um, I could have sworn you were, uh, Uh, fuck man. Was it that front door? I swear, like ever since we moved into this place, it's just like slam, slam, slam, like bang, every single morning I keep slamming. But I'm guessing you were coming out for a cycle anyway, weren't you? To be honest, mate, I don't wash my clothes either. It's been a few days since I washed this little number and I'm just kind of... It does smell a bit, yeah, but I just kind of go with it. You know, it's made me appreciate more what my Mum did, you know, washing our clothes every single day, every single week as well and we finished school for the week. She'd always wash our fucking school uniform, P.E kits, everything. Yeah. Much more like, you know, just a big appreciation for my Mum, I guess. Hmm, yeah, I guess so. You come past here a lot then? Uh, - I mean, sometimes yeah. - Sometimes never though. Hmm. It's where we first met, isn't it? Well, it's where we first became friends. Right. Yeah, because we went to primary school together first, - you little shit. - Oh, yeah. Yeah. I remember we, uh... Me, you and Jasper had our first ciggy down there. Yeah, but you couldn't even handle the guilt, mate. That's where you fucking ratted us out to the teacher and your mum. Yeah and then you pretended that we bullied you into doing it. That wasn't then. That was when we first got stoned, man. Not first ciggy. I'm not sure. Oh, yeah. Guess what, actually? My, uh, my bong arrived last night. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Good? I mean you can have if you want? - Have some of the weed too. - No. Mate, don't feel guilty about it. Might help you chill out, you know? Yeah, maybe. I have been going a bit mad recently. Oh, yeah? I suppose it's... It's more like, I feel nothing at the moment, you know? Kind of like an empty. I guess the anger stimulates me in a way. You know what I mean? No. It's just like, I'm a... Like a floating angry brain sometimes. Like that Futurama episode. Yeah. Yeah, like Futurama. Look, look Dan. Don't you think it's time you went home? Breakfast is almost ready, mate. Come on. So, uh, how was the rest of the cycle? What are you making? Veggie full English. You hungry? Veggie English. Same again, yeah? Yeah. I mean, I guess I've made it before. You're guessing? Look. I'm gonna go out and buy some recipe books today, I promise. You know, Jamie, Nigel a. All of that shit. If that's what you want, I'll go and do that. If that's what you want. Not sure. Hey man, do you think we could stick some music on? Oh yeah, so the Miknas, Wilcox case that's uh, coming to a close real soon apparently. I mean, I've put my bets on him getting sent away for life, but getting sent away for life doesn't - actually mean life, does it? - I'm not sure. You're not gonna be there till the day you die, does it? I mean, it's usually reserved for like killers and stuff, right? I have no idea. I'm not sure. Alright, take a seat if you want. Breakfast is... It's not far off. - Hey, Tom. - Yo? Can we, uh... What's that? Money, it's the symbol of money. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I owe you money, don't I? Yeah, right. Uh, how much was it again? Um, hold on. I have a receipt in the room. Can I grab it? We got time? Yeah, yeah. You've got time. You've got time. - Yep. - Yeah. Go on. I do feel guilty about it all by the way, so... You can't trust yourself, Dan. Look, Dan. Don't you think it's time you went home? Yeah. Oh, yes. Come on. Who was that? Dan? Oh, you alright? What was that about? Hmm. - Oh, you got it? - Yeah. Alright, here you go. Two secs. Cheers. You got the 33? Uh, what? It was 30 and 33. You got the, uh... Uh, you what? It's 30.33. Uh, I don't have any loose change at the moment, mate. Is that alright? Not really. Still kind of owe me money, you know? - Yeah but it's just 30p. - Yeah, exactly. Well, I mean, it's actually 33, so... Okay. I mean, can you let that go? Well, I mean, it's just 33. I mean like, it's 33p now, then it's 27p and it adds up, it's just the principle, you know? Right. Hold on. Look, don't you just think you're exaggerating a little bit there, Danny boy? It adds up over time. Oh, come on, man. What? Yeah? Come on. I'll get you a glass water. You want a glass water? No, actually, no, I... I don't wanna glass of water. I want my money actually, to be honest with you. Where you going with those, mate? Man, where are you going? Where you going, man? But Dan, what about your keys? You don't have any keys, mate! Mate, where are you going? Please just... Mate please, honestly. Oi! Just... Please! Mate. No seriously, please. Seriously, please. Mate, what are you doing? I just wanna be alone, please. Just leave me... Where you going huh? Where are you going? - What you doing? - Just fuck off. Can you please just leave me alone? - Please? - Come on, man. Otherwise I'm gonna have to come up and get you, aren't I? Lighter, lighter, lighter. I wonder where's the lighter. Mama mia! Yes. Don't you think it's time to go, Dan? You're in a very long and dark tunnel, Dan. It's hard to see the light, but you'll come out eventually. Why? You're past the point of beyond saving, Dan. - You gonna be okay? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Are you sure? Alright? Oh, no. Not really. Why's that? Look. Please don't get... You know, just keep your cool about this. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Cool. That's fine. Had that party last night, did you? Fine. It is? Yeah. But you've had all day to clear it up, haven't you? You know? Well, look, it... Technically it wasn't last night. Sure. I imagine it went onto the early hours, did it? It, you know, it started... It was mostly on Friday, but I guess, you know, technically it started last Thursday. Oh! The sun was out this morning. Did you notice it? Oh, shit. Yeah. I'm clearing up. I'm clearing up. Yeah. Yeah, Alright. What's that? I've... I've never had to use one of those before mate so, can't be mine. Yeah. Alright okay, maybe we should call the police and I'm sure they'd help us, you know, figure it out. Why the fuck don't you ever just listen - Danny boy. - To what I'm trying say to you? Danny boy. Just take a seat, man. - Chill out. - I don't... I think... Don't you think we should talk about our living situation? - I was waiting for the outcome. - The outcome? Why don't you ever do shit for me? You're my fucking housemate. And my friend. Aren't you? I think you should move out. Don't... Don't think it'll be better for the both of us if you just, you know, if you just - packed your shit up and left? - Why should I move out? Well, most of the shit in here's mine, isn't it? Who organized everything about this place? I organized the bills. The back and forth with the fucking prick of a landlord. You know, who was it that then went behind my back and secretly scrapped the fucking decorator that I organized - moments before. - Come on. That wasn't a secret. Why? Why can't you move out? Why can't you move out? Oh, so you'll just pay for this by yourself, will you? You'll fork out whole month's rent by yourself? - Again with this fucking money. - The whole month, yeah? Okay, in that case, could you please pay me the 33p that you owe me? Fuck off. Oh, so you'll just live on your own, yeah? I thought I said, didn't I? - Someone's already moving in. - Who? Spoons. He's left her here, he's just gone out for a little bit to deal and uh... The mushroom head? Yeah, he was at the party the other night. Oh, the one you had four nights ago, yeah? Dan, you've got two days, mate. Hey, how you doing? - Watch out. - Oh. - You okay? - Yeah. - Not bad. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What have you been up to? Uh, busy. You know. - What have you been doing? - Usual. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Oh, Tommy told me by the way. Oh, uh, yeah. Did he say something about me? About you guys not living together anymore? Oh, yeah. I think it'll probably be good for both of you - to have some space, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Hmm. Where were you the other day? Um, I thought I'd give Tom some, you know, alone time. After the argument. - Oh. - We had an argument. Yeah. He wasn't really alone. There was like 200 people at yours in the end. - 200? - Yeah. Dude. 200. Was it, uh... Was everyone like squashed in or was there like space? Was it? - Yeah. Yeah. - Was it? Yeah. Um, anyway, I wanted to say, uh... I wanted to say that even though you two aren't living together now, we can still hang out. If you want to? If you want to? Yeah. Just ask Tommy for my number and then just call me. - Alright. - Yeah? Yeah.
