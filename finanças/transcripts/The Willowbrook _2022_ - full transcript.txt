Hello, my loves. I wanted to talk to you today about trusting the flow of life. You are exactly where you need to be... Right here, right now... Even when it doesn't feel like it. Oh. Just the gas? Yeah, yeah, just the gas. That's my sister, by the way. We're not... You know what I mean? A thing. So, you know. All of your challenges, all of your struggles, these are all intended to help you grow. Trust the process. Be with oneness. We were making so much progress. Brandi, I am giving you exactly what you need to heal. Okay. Brandi. Brandi... I have been a friend to you. Please. I have watched you repeat cycles... ...over and over and over again. You are here for a reason. Holy smokes, brother. Fuck. You see this? It's like a mansion. I can't believe we came all the way out here. You excited or what? Not really. Damn. Okay. Now I have someone upstairs who needs my help. You okay? Sure? Not really. Yo, yo, put it... Put it out. Put it out. Somebody's coming. Put it out. Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Did you blow that in my face? Sorry. Stop. Stop. Stop. Please come in. It's cold. Oh... Damn. This place is crazy. It used to be an inn. Whoa. Are you in a band? Because if not, you definitely should be. What you doing? Hi. Adam's social skills are somewhat left to be desired. I'm not in a band. Are you? Nah. I wish, though. I play the drums. Do you wanna hear my music? Adam, Lacey's recording. Oh, yeah. Everyone's always trying to sabotage my zest for life. How... How do you all know Lacey? She's my sister. Or I guess she's our sister. Let's go to the dining room. Yeah. Yeah, sure. Come on. Yo... You should never take your makeup off. You want to smell these flowers? Look, this is our family. That's me. That's Syd. There's Lacey. Everyone else is dead. And you're not up there yet. Y'all just shoot guns like that? For fun? Sharpshooting is Dakota's favorite sport. Sport? It's fucked up. Syd said Dakota's propensity towards noise and chaos reflects his inner torment. It's just years and years of trauma that has manifested in this cathartic expression of shooting things in the air. It's really violent. That's deep. You guys wanna hear a song? Welcome to The Willowbrook. I am so happy that you're here. Uh, who's, uh, who's that out... Who's that outside? Dakota's been my boyfriend since we were practically kids. Syd, will you get us some tea? Let the three of us get to know each other. How are you feeling? Not the best. And that is understandable. How you doing emotionally? Hey. No, listen. It's okay. You just got here. Let yourself experience whatever you're experiencing. No judgment. Just feel like a burden. You are not a burden. You are giving me the gift to support you. Besides... everybody has their issues. Have you met my family? What's Dakota's deal? Dakota's in charge of the farm where we grow our online-retail products. We appreciate you having us. Of course. This is my life's purpose. The boys spend most of the time in the den. Please help me out. Please, somebody. Somebody help. Okay. We got to get this man a real drum set. He's a rock star. He can't play on pots and pans. That's the last thing he needs. I bought this place to be a peaceful retreat. Syd, will you show Ace to his room? And which room will that be? - The corner suite west. - I hate that room. I mean, it's... it's nice. Jo and I can share a room. Honestly, it's no big deal. No, please, I... They're all single beds. You can have your own rooms. I will take Jo to her room, and Syd will show you yours. Rock on, brother. I will. Yeah, uh, I'll just... Oh, man. Ha! You are one lucky guy. What makes you say that? Look around, Big Syd. This is the life. Syd, come on, man. What's wrong with you? You good? Look at this. Syd? Why don't you tell Jordan that dinner's almost ready? He is a sensitive soul. Lucky to have each other. Mm-hmm. Jo's room is pretty far. Don't you think I should be close by? So, I didn't want to tell you this in front of the others... but having you close to Jordan is not in her best interest right now. And why is that? Because she needs to learn how to function without you. But I'm all she's ever had. Right. And do you want to be all she ever has? Look, Ace. I know that you've had a hard life. I can't even begin to imagine what it was like. Growing up in a home, never adopted. And then you move in together as adults. Your relationship is so beautiful. But it's also highly codependent. And while this may be difficult to stomach, it's your codependency that has brought her here. Jordan needs to learn how to stand on her own two feet. What do you need me to do? Trust me. So I can help her. Okay. Did you try to kill yourself? 'Cause a lot of the people who came here, they tried to kill themselves. No. - Hmm. - It was an accident. I, um... I just took too much at one time. Okay. You... You kind of kick ass. Wow. Gosh. No one ever said that to me before. Yeah. You bang the hell out of those drums. That was crazy. I've never heard anything like it. Really? I can see you rocking a stadium. Nah. Nah, that's stupid. That's... No, I'm serious. You... You should start a band. No, we're not supposed to talk about things like that. - Nope. - Why not? No, no, no, no, no. Nope. Nope. Yeah, so... But it's your life. I mean, I've always wanted to be a real rock star. - Yeah, that's dope. - Yeah. Yeah. Hi. May I help you? You... You are? Oh, I'm Michael. Brandi's husband. Oh! Uh, it's so nice to meet you. You know, Brandi was real excited for your help. - I mean, we've been... - Michael, Brandi left. What? She didn't want to commit to recovery. When I woke up this morning, she was already gone. She didn't say where she was going? I'm sorry. I mean, I don't know why she would leave such a beautiful home. Thank you. And please know you're welcome back anytime. Thank you. Seriously. But I'm sorry. I know you're busy. It was just a long drive. It's okay. I'll just go. Shh. Oh. Gotta be quiet. But I mean, we could have a band rehearsal right after dinner if you want. - Sure. - Really? Sure. - Let's go. - Let's go. - Come on. - Okay. Jordan? You, my dear, are in the right place. Thank you. Seriously. To moving forward. To healing. To our band. Dakota. I wasn't aware you would be joining us for dinner. Yep. Got done early. What's going on, my man? Ace. Enjoying your stay? Staying warm? Kody. So, what kind of shit do you use? Kody, it's inappropriate. Well? Oxy, Xanax, aerosol, Ambien, Vicodin, coke, booze, Adderall, weed, heroin, sex, cutting, sex while cutting. That's different. Ashing. And then the grand repeat. I like that. I think me and you could fuckin' hang out, actually. Think that'd be nice. Kody, you smell like the farm. Why don't you go upstairs and take a nice hot shower? Ace, you wouldn't mind helping Dakota on the farm tomorrow, would you? Sure. Nobody likes the farm. You know, if they would, they'd come back. You'll love it, Ace. One day, you're gonna learn to shut up, Adam. I think we're all a little tired. Why are you being a creep? You just gonna act like that didn't just happen? That was weird. It was... interesting. To say the least. And then why would you tell them all your business like that? I didn't like the way he was looking at me. You all right? Yeah. I'm fine. Just, um... I need a fuckin' cigarette, actually. So, like I said earlier, everybody has their issues. I think the takeaway is to claim them and work towards growth. Ace, you can call it a night. You have a big day at the farm tomorrow. Oh, yeah, that's right. The farm. - I can walk you up. - That's okay. He knows where it is. You know, it's, uh, it's cool, Jo. I'll, uh... I'll see you in the morning. Do your thing. Yeah. See you tomorrow. May I come in? I know what it feels like to hurt. But the things that hurt us also heal us. And someday, I promise... all of this suffering is going to be beneficial to you. But healing is hard work. You have to want it. I know. I mean, really want it. I do. Okay. We'll heal you. I'll make you a bath. Where are we? She offered for us to come up to her place to help you work through your first couple days of recovery. You excited or what? Will you leave here with me? When? Now. Very romantic idea. Think we should. You're not serious. Kody, I have guests. They need me. What about us? Where are you going? The farm. When will you be back? Good morning, my loves. They want me to go on a farm? What the hell will I do on a farm? Never been on a farm a day in my damn life. It's like Rumi says. The wound is the place where the light enters you. What does that mean? All of your challenges, all of your struggles, these are all intended to help you grow. Remember that next time things are difficult. You're struggling, and you want to give up. Will you just let us go up there? No. What are you gonna do that we can't? I don't know. The farm... Never been on a farm a day in my life. The hell? You are here for a reason. The fuck you doing? Somebody just tried to break into my room. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Was your door locked? - Yeah, man. Well, then, there you go. Don't worry about it. It was probably a crackhead. - What? - Get dressed. We're headed to the farm. I am dressed. That's what you're wearing? Yeah. Cute beanie. Shh. She's recording. Okay. How does today feel on you? Like a death blanket. Whoa, whoa. That could totally be our band name. Have you unpacked yet? No. Still settling in. I wonder if that's, like, an orphan thing, like living out of your luggage. Yeah, it's the circus. Hi. How can I help you? Where is he? I think maybe you're asking the wrong question. Where's my fucking brother? I'll call the cops. Again, will you please... I got this, Syd. Hello, Lewey. Where's Kyle? I think you're asking the wrong person. I know what you are. Get off my property. Oh, it's cold as fuck, man. So, what you think? Uh, it's really a farmhouse. Maybe Kyle'll let you borrow a shotgun, and we can shoot some shit later. Nah, nah. I don't fuck with guns, man. You don't fuck with guns? No. What, you don't like guns? No. Really? No, I don't. What the fuck? Fuck with dishes. All these damn dishes you got in here? Hey, man, you need to clean this place. You got roaches. Oh. Bro, what is that? That thing is still alive. God damn. Yep. You like this place? It's quiet. What is that? Shit that makes Lacey feel important. So, why you got it? I like taking her expensive shit. So, you just walk around with it in your pocket like it's a heirloom? Want to hit this? Come on, man. Smoke it. Man, give me that shit, man. Give it here. You look like you're about to cry. What the fuck is in this? Yeah. Fuck. I'm sorry, Jordan. What happened earlier just, uh, it shook me up. What was all that about? Dakota hired Lewey's brother to help him with the farm. One day he doesn't show up. No one's heard from him since. What'd the police say? Police were useless. It's been so hard on Kody. They were like brothers. What happened? I don't know. But he was unstable. Poor Lewey. Big man's awake. - Who? - Come on. Come meet the big man, Ace. You'll love him. He's a nice guy. Come on. He all right? Yeah, just takes him a little bit to warm up to you. Ain't that right, Kyle? Kyle. I'm sorry about earlier. I was reactive. And I know better. Your attachment to your old way of being is standing in the way of your transformation. Let's get you back to your room, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Mm. Thanks, brother. That's the last of it. Come on, man. Fuck. What'd you think of the house? It's a big, expensive-ass house. Be real. Nobody out here but us. Me and Jo are all we got. To see her almost lose her life and ruin mine... So if this makes her happy, that's what we got to do. You're a good dude, Ace. Breathing in. And breathing out. Yes. Let yourself feel. Breathing in. And breathing out. Good, Jordan. Good. Let that breath move through you. Can you find a sense of surrender? Just not a giving up. It's a giving in. Giving in to the present moment. Accept it just as it is. It's beautiful, and there's nothing lacking. Good, Jordan. Keep breathing. Feeling better? Good. Have you ever thought about switching out your wardrobe? I, uh, I think I've got enough to work on. What if your attachment to your old way of being is standing in the way of your transformation? Humor me. Sunday Fun day in the den. We'll both wear cozy PJs, and you can borrow a pair of mine. ♪ We're the mail-order maids you ordered ♪ ♪ By parcel post we come to you ♪ ♪ Keep the one that you like best ♪ ♪ And then return the rest ♪ ♪ For any one of us will bring a thrill... ♪ - Are you okay? - Mm. ♪ We're all guaranteed, we'll never break ♪ ♪ Just try one out, these stars above ♪ ♪ And the bride that you get from a mail-order house ♪ ♪ Will come to you in a day or so ♪ - Are you comfortable? - Mm-hmm. This couch is just really weird. Oh! Christmastime, the holidays. Is this the way they end for me, here in this place? A mental hospital they call it. That's a fancy name, that is, but I know a better... The bug house. The place where they'll lock you up and then throw away the key. And now they've got me too. Me, Fred Clanton. Fred Clanton. Fred Clanton. Is that really my name? Everything's so mixed up. Can I have some popcorn? This is my favorite show. Everything's dark. Even the sky. That George, he's turned them all against me. Even Betty. They keep talking about me. Why won't they let me alone? So, I've been told I'm not too good at social cues. Um... So if you want to make out, can you just tell me? Yeah. Oh, my God. Noted. Yeah. I'll never get out. Cool. Yeah. What will happen to me now? Where is she? Did you check the basement? We're struggling, babe. I know. Lewey came by today. What'd he say? He's a problem. Fuck, Lacey. Good. I know Kyle was your friend. But he hurt me. So you did what you had to do. Please... don't put me in danger again. I just want to feel safe. Thanks, man. I feel like shit. How's Jo? She doing okay? I think she's doing better than you, actually. What did you think of the farm? It was... cool. No one's ever said that about the farm before. What did Dakota have you do today? We just chilled at the house. No, it is not for me, Big Syd, no. Me neither. No disrespect, though, to, um, Dakota and, uh, Kyle. It's not for me, man. Thanks, brother. You might be the most interesting person I've ever met. Yeah, I never forget anything. I see that. My brain kicks ass. - So, like, what's Atlanta like? - Who's Atlanta? It's where I'm from. It's fine. It's like any other city, I guess. I've never been to the city. No shit? Yeah, I've never really been anywhere, actually. We can't leave. But I think about it all the time, where I would go. Where would you go? I would go to New York. It's like, I don't know, like the antithesis of isolation. That's funny. I left the city to come to a retreat. Well, I feel like retreat is a euphemism. Lacey says everyone has a different perspective. Yeah, but Lacey fucked us up. I win. You want to play again? I was kidding. Go. Where is he? You'll find your way out. Sorry. You feeling any better? Yeah. It's fun hanging out with you guys. If you want to take a smoke break, uh, while Lacey's recording, you probably just have about 20 minutes. Dude, I wish. I, uh, surrendered the cigs with my phone. You should check for them in the room at the end of your hallway. Seriously? Wait. Wait. Is this your card? It is. Shut the door. Shut the door! Shut the door! Shut the door! Where is she? Lacey? She, um... She's recording. Where... Where are the others? In the... They're in the den downstairs. What the fuck is going on? Keep... Keep my ties loose. Okay, yeah. Wait! No, no, no, no. Wait. Would... Did you get invited? Yeah. Was she supposed to heal you? Did she do this to you? She's fucking sick. Go untie the others like you did mine. They can't... They can't know that you know. I don't know... Please. Where? In the other rooms. Go. Hurry. Go. In the other rooms. - Hurry. - Okay. - Go. - Okay. Hello, my loves. I want to talk to you today about trusting in the flow of life. You are exactly where you're meant to be... Right here, right now... Even when it doesn't feel like it. All of your struggles, these are all intended to help you grow. Trust the process. Be with oneness. They're all fucking out of it. They look dead. They've been here longer. What are we doing? That's not normal, right? - Hey. - Hey. You want to, um... ...put on some punk makeup and have a quiet band practice? That would... Yeah, it... it's, um... I mean, um, there's nothing I want more than to be in this moment with you. You have to be as quiet as possible. Or Lacey will lose it. Shh. This... This is my shot. You're a rock star. Did you do it? That's that. Did you hurt her? Tell me the truth about Kyle. I have, over and over and over again. Why do you want me to relive my trauma? Did you take care of the Lewey situation? Yes. Oh, sweetheart, you're stressed. Why don't you just... Don't come near me. Don't come near me. Stop. Please, just for once, tell me the fucking truth. Please, no games. I don't need this energy before my next show. Do you want to just lay down? Fuck, Lacey. Come on, Lacey! Fine! He was reckless. He was disrespectful. And he really messed things up. I do what it takes to protect what I've built. You told me that he hurt you. You fuckin' told me that. I lied. I'm done with this. I'm done with you. Kody. Kody. I have warned you about the noise, you worthless piece of shit! You think you're talented? You think you're a rock star? Pathetic. Look at you. You are nothing! Go take off the makeup, you freak. Jo. Jo, you in there? It's me. Hello, my loves. The problem is never the problem itself. It's all about how we choose to view it. Because everything is perspective. And with the right perspective, your problems will become your gifts. And as you move through the rest of your evening, I want your takeaway to be, which problem will you turn into a gift? Ace wasn't in his room. And now Dakota's gone too. Where's Adam? I don't know. And as you move into the rest of your evening, think, which problem are you going to take and turn into a gift? Your sister's a sick fuck, Syd. Oh, look at all these comments. I'll get to as many of you as possible. What the fuck are we gonna do? The microphones pick up everything. Whoo! You're a rock star. Yeah. It's okay. It's me. I'm Jo, by the way.

You were gonna kill yourself before me. - What? - Look at you now. If Michael could see you now... Fuck you. No, I am just like you. I have felt pain. I have suffered. But I have gotten strong.
