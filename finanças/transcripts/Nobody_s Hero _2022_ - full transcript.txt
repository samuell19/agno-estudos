NOBODY'S HERO - Hello. - Hi. Wanna grab a coffee or something? Why should we? To break the ice. I'm hitting on you. We can go faster. No. I want to hit on you normally. No charge. Why shouldn't I charge you? I'm anti-prostitution. Buying someone's body isn't cool. Really? I really like you. Yeah. They all do. I doubt that. Or they'd go elsewhere. It's you I wanna make love to. I'm not looking for a quickie. How about a drink someplace warm? I'm short on time. I'm expecting someone. A little later. Your first time? You have sex off the clock, right? I'm even married. - You never cheat? - No. It's dumb but... I'd do things for you the others don't. Gotta go. Here's my number. Call me? Promise? Hello? Médéric? Speaking. I have a free hour after work at 8. You available? Yeah, sure. Meet me at 8:15 at Hotel de France. ok? In the street where we met. Ask for me. Isadora. I just ask for Isadora? Right. See you then. See you. Evening. Isadora, please. Room 205. Second floor. - Thanks. - At your service. Come in. Hello. Whaddya watching? Whatever's on. Funny. You decide work's over at 8 every day? My husband doesn't want me home late. So it's alright? You agree there's no charge? Easy, easy... Don't overdo it. It's so good, I swear. No charge. There are two dead and several wounded... - Don't you feel anything? - There's been an attack. Shit. It was here. - In Clermont? - Place de Jaude. Stop. I gotta go. I want to fuck you. I'm gonna cum on your tits. We have to stop! It'll only take 5 minutes. Nothing we can do about it. I want it so bad. It's serious. Come in, why don't you? I was worried sick. Me too. I planned to call once he'd finished. Fine day for overtime! I could hear you outside. Life doesn't have to stop for a terrorist attack. Why was your phone off? He couldn't cum. Refund him. That's ok. Sorry. There's a lot of commotion here. It's a chaotic situation. It's hard to know what happened. There were reportedly gunshots, and a machete attack. Did you hear? They know who did it? Stay safe. The terrorists may not all be dead. That'll be 30 euros. Thanks. You're good with women. I bet she does it for everyone. Not like that. With you something big happened. You don't mind hiring kids? Charlène's not a kid. She's in 8th grade. Well, bye. Bye. Mister? Got 5 euros for a sandwich? Don't sneak up like that. Especially after an attack. Coz I'm Arab? I can't see your face. Why the hood? I'm cold without it. I wasn't involved, I swear. - I just asked for change! - Relax. We're all jumpy. Be careful. I haven't eaten all day. A little more? 2 euros is a good start. It won't buy a kebab. Good night. A group of attackers struck randomly with machetes. According to eyewitnesses, they shouted "Allah Akbar." Two attackers were killed, but others may still be at large in Clermont. Police also suspect an explosive belt. Authorities are calling for a lockdown. The situation remains dangerous in Clermont. If you're just tuning in we're continuing our coverage of this evening's attack. The terrorism taskforce met moments ago. We do know the 1st attacker's identity: A 20-year-old Franco-Moroccan, a fan of martial arts and antique arms. He led a rural life with his mother and had no criminal record. No information on the 2nd attacker. His identity remains a mystery... He had no police record and lived with his mother. No news about the 2nd attacker. His identity remains a mystery. Surveillance footage from the shopping mall shows a 3rd man police say is... Hello? - Hello. - Yes? Is this Isadora's phone? This the guy from yesterday? That wasn't me. It's been a while. Can I speak to her? Why? For a date. I'll put her on. - Hello? - It's me. I want to see you. - So do I. When? - I dunno... Thursday at 5 o'clock works. - At my place? - See you then. Yeah. Hello? Hello. - Is Isadora here? - No. When will she be back? You think I know her schedule? Ok, I won't insist. WAS THERE A THIRD MAN? Don't get too attached to Isadora. She's bad news. I just want to see her. Her husband's jealous. I don't want trouble. We're a respectable hotel. Ok. Bye. Evening. Can I come inside? An hour or two, and I'll go. Please. Come in. - You're a lifesaver. - Forget.it. He may have carried out the attacks against his partners' wishes out of hatred for the city. It would seem the group was fighting. I brought you dry clothes. Thanks. Thanks a lot. - Can I take this? - That's ok. - It's not wet? - No thanks. - I'll dry it upstairs. - No. I'd rather keep it. Where will you dry it? Over there. Don't spend the night here. I promise, Mister. Got a place to go? Police Precinct. Evening, sir. I have the photo. I think the 3rd terrorist may be in my hallway. How's that? I can't be sure... It's hard to tell from the photo. What makes you think it's him? He's on the street. Nowhere to go. Unusual for a young Arab. He's also wearing a strange belt. How thick is an explosive belt? Where are you? - Rue Ledru. - In Clermont? What's he doing there? He wanted to get out of the rain. To get warm. I let him in. On our way. Name and address. Don't blame me if it's not him. No, you were right to call. Your name? For the explosive belt... It's unlikely, but who knows? Name and address. I'll send someone. The man may have acted alone for unknown reasons. A police source tells us there was discord within the group. - Freeze! - A guy upstairs let me in! Hands up! In the air! Get in. - How are you, sir? - Fine. Isadora isn't here. Mr. Renard will be right down. Know where she lives? Read it later. You work here full time? After school. I want to make it my career. Aren't you a bit young? Mr. Renard is very nice. Does he leave you alone a lot? Never very long. Are you related? Good day, sir. Bye. Hotel de France. Charlène here. Meet me in the Cathedral tomorrow at 1. With all my heart SUSPECT ARRESTED LAST NIGHT I'm so happy to see you! My husband's suspicious. - We didn't get very far. - Far enough. - Come to my place. - No time. Hey! Stop it! Can you follow that Audi? Discreetly? Yes, please. Wait! You slam the door in my face! - Fuck you! - Stop shouting! - Police Precinct. - Yes, hello. A woman's being assaulted. But I'm not positive. I'll send someone in case. Where are you? Gergovie Street. - 38? - Exactly. We don't go there anymore. How's that? Hello? Looking for someone? No... Just making a call. All the way out here? I got lost. We don't like loiterers around here. I want to get back to the center. This way by car. That way on foot. Quite a hike. I'm on foot. Whatcha doing here? A lady let me in. She said to be tidy. You plan to stay? Didn't the police place you? They just let me go. So you came back? I've nowhere else to go. Now you know I'm innocent. - Why? - They let me go. - Your folks? - In Lyon. I don't wanna go back. I'd die there, I swear. You prefer the streets? It won't last forever. Mister? Can I use your toilet? Crazy as it sounds, witnesses agree: They didn't shout "Allah Akbar," but the name "Omar." It's easy to speculate: Why shout an accomplice's name? Was it revenge? Finished? Be right out. Can I borrow this till tomorrow? Ok. Mind if I shower, please? Can I check my email while I dry off? It won't take long. Sure. Thanks. Go buy a kebab. I'll get locked out. - I'll let you in. - Yeah? Promise. Buzz "Roman." Thanks. - See you soon. - Yeah. - Yes? - Evening. Hi. You shouldn't let that kid in. - I didn't. - Who then? No idea. He's harmless. He got arrested for a reason. They released him. They had no proof, so what? Why take the risk? Evening. Mr. Cog, know who let that kid in? No, I just fed him. Bright idea! Now he'll never leave. Blame Mr. Roman. It was raining. I couldn't leave him outside. Then why not offer him your place? I don't want him here. Neither do I. Or in the stairwell either. See his black flag? So? A black flag in Arabic, see it? You saw Arabic? Mr. Laur said so. - How'd he see it? - From his place with binoculars. An ISIS flag doesn't make him a terrorist. Odd thing to have in your bag. Odd he's homeless, too. It's rare for an Arab. It proves he's innocent. How's that? Terrorists have hideouts. They don't sleep in stairwells. Now it happens everywhere. Look what a guy in a truck can do! True, anyone can snap. What's up? Did you let the kid in? I just gave him a blanket. Do you realize? Wouldn't you want help? I'm not a jihadist! Did Mr. Laur say that? Mr. Laur talks nonsense. - Based on what? - Years of experience. The kid can't stay here forever! Just till he bounces back. He'll find a shelter. Keeping him here only aggravates his problems. At least he's warm... Feeding him keeps him alive. It could give him hope and trust, and even keep him afloat. Or dissuade him from future attacks. Sure, if I was freezing in the streets who knows what I'd do? He'll attract the local scum. We'll never be rid of them. So kick him out. Into the cold, but I won't. If you let him back in, no way! Let's all agree. Just a night or two. We can decide later. That's France! We do nothing, we wait and see... Sélim, where are you? Please respond. Mom and Dad are worried. When will you be home? Check this out, Sélim. It's WILD! ACCESS DENIED DUE TO TERRORIST CONTENT Looking for someone? No. I think it's that way. No shop talk tonight. My offer interests you, right? Of course. Shall we? Maybe another day? When can you start? Mid-January would be great. We'd start off slow. A few hours a week. Either I start or I don't. Ok, then. Do you want to work with me? Of course. It doesn't show. My date just cancel led. Invite me up for a drink? Look, Florence. I have an early morning. Let's talk Friday night, or even Thursday afternoon. - You live here? - Yes. Just a quick drink to plan Friday's call. My girlfriend's asleep. - Your girlfriend? - Yes. You can't have a friend over? We won't make noise. Come on, you never cheat? I try not to. You shouldn't be outside. What's it to you? It's no time for kissing outside. Good one! Actually, it's the perfect time. Shouldn't you be catching terrorists? We do that too. Careful, ma'am. You saw my badge. I'm a business owner. The backbone of this country. I want to live in peace. Florence, it's his job. She drank too much. We're all on edge. Ledru and Reynaud Street for a PI. A PI? What the hell? I'm not rowdy. - What's a PI? - I'm sober. I want a breathalyzer. You have no right! Yes, we do. You arrest law-abiding citizens while the jihadists run free. Florence, I'm going to bed. So should you. Talk tomorrow, ok? - Come! - What's happening? I have a mattress upstairs. No, that's ok. I want to sleep. It's more comfortable. Come! No friends? Strange. Making friends is easy at your age. Keeps me out of trouble. Aren't you bored? You gonna let me make the bed alone? Not getting undressed? No, too tired. Police Precinct. There are radicalized Muslims in my living room. Radicalized, how? They're praying so devoutly. Did you call before? This time it's urgent! You're not dependable. Can you send photos? What if they see? Be careful. Get up. I'm still tired. I have to go. I'm not leaving you alone. I'll behave. I'll sleep till you're back. I don't know you, or where you're from... Lyon. I already told you. You'd leave a stranger in your house? Yeah. - No. - How do you know? I bet you wouldn't. Anyway, this is about me. - I don't want your opinion. - Don't insult me! Don't look down on me because I'm homeless! Why have guests, if you throw them out? Shit. I swear, I won't steal. Isn't this Mr. Médéric's? - See you tonight, doll. - Bye, my love. You shouldn't be here! This is crazy. I couldn't wait. I missed you. You can't stay here. Go! He shouldn't treat you like that. I just want to help. Come to my place. Better not get involved. I have to get that. Mr. Petit! What a surprise. Ma'am. I saw a weirdo outside your house. I didn't notice. I saw a similar man Tuesday. I told your husband about it. - He didn't mention it. - To not worry you. But twice in 3 days, I had to warn you. Thanks, Mr. Petit. Especially with your husband out. Thanks. I'll be careful. - He left for work? - Yes. Holler if you need me. I'm not far. Use the porch light if you need me. Thank you. Coming! I'm worried. Let me check the yard. That's not necessary. Your husband would want me to. I don't think so. Right... - He may be inside. - What for? Yours is a dangerous line of work. You're not gonna search the whole house! Just checking on my way out. Empty, right? - Have a nice day. - You too. Médéric? Morning, Florence. Good job last night. What a gentleman! What was I supposed to say? That hiding at home is what the Islamists want. You were unbearable. You wouldn't listen. Actually I took your advice and went straight home. I need a spin-off. How's Enola 1? They're good with B-to-B and B-to-C. But weak on data exchange and DMP. What about cross-device? No, even cross-device. Did you start the benchmarking? Make yourself at home! Why are you here? Just praying till you got back. Here. Isadora sent me. Gérard knows everything. I can't see you anymore. Any response? Is praying all you could find to do? It was time. No response. You can go. So can you. It was on a secluded plateau 50 km south of Clermont that the man set off his explosive belt. Unclear if it was a suicide or accident. We do know the man was isolated, alone in this snowy landscape and a threat to no one. He hadn't even been located. But the police urge caution. Here, doll. Thanks. You alright? What's on your mind? The kid who blew himself up. And the others, too. What happened in their lives? Don't start pitying them. - They're dead, too. - By choice. I wonder which is worse. Worse than what? If you die suddenly you don't know what hit you. But to choose death... To plan it for weeks or months must be awful. What do you mean? We have a real problem. It's our problem? Kids with no regard for their lives or ours doesn't trouble you? It's just a few wackos. It's starting to add up. It's more than poverty or religion. It means there's no hope. It means life isn't worth living. It means it won't just stop. That doesn't scare you? Don't be scared. That's what they want. Enough. It's no use. What's with you today? You ok? Was it an accident or a suicide? - Bye. - Goodbye, Isadora. There is still no obvious link with the Clermont attacks. - Who is it? - It's me. Kiss me. - Yes? - Buzz me in! Open up! Are you inside? Get off me! Shut up! Let him be, you thugs! Butt out! The cops are coming. What's that guy's problem? - Get lost! - It's private! What the hell is this? Get lost! Whatcha doing? I'll show you assholes. Show who? - This is our turf! - Don't provoke them. Let's bounce! Come back with your friends! I'll fight you all, little shits! You ok, honey? It hurts. Stand up. Let's go inside. Come on. Get up. Go on, feel sorry for him. You had to lead them here? Think you'd have done better? I don't hang out with thugs. Leave him alone! Now we have to defend him too! Hey! Hasn't he had enough? The way you provoked them, they'll be back. I provoked them? Gimme a break! They almost attacked your husband. Maybe you did overdo it. Where were you, smart ass? You like a good party, but when the shit hits the fan... It hurts. Call an ambulance. What are you doing? Bringing him to our place. He has to rest. Ok.But not all night. We'll see later. Say, Mr. EI Alaoui, - You cover your wife? - I don't. What's on her head? She decided to wear it. I can't stop her. Mr. Roman? - Were you asleep? - Not really. Can he stay the night? My husband wants him out. - What about the hospital? - They're full. There's no room with this cold. And their budget cuts. What do you expect? He's a sturdy kid. Right, Sélim? My head, arm and knee still hurt. I have company. Did you ask Ms. Dupuis? No. She's afraid. Come in. Thanks. May Allah protect you. Bye. Bye. What'd those guys want? I dunno, they're crazy. They smoke all day. They started calling me gay. Do I look gay to you? In any case, it's no problem if you are. They looked angry. They'll be back. You want me gone, too? Even for you, it's the best solution. It was just to scare me. They won't be back. Can I take a shower? Sure, go ahead. - Don't take forever. - I promise. Hello. Evening, Ma'am. Isadora, Sélim. He's sleeping on the sofa. Go take your shower! Gimme your clothes. I'll run a wash. Thanks. - Hungry? - No, thanks. Médéric? It's Florence! I need to talk to you. I've been calling for an hour! I'm busy. Can you take a raincheck? Why don't you answer your phone? I turned it off. - You turn it off at night? - Yeah. The client moved the call up. Can we do it here? No, I have company. How'd you get in the building? Don't screw this up for me! Does it have to be this morning? He'll need specs. I'll get stuck on details. OK. Meet you at your office. - I'll wait. - Go on. I'll Meet you. - Don't stand me up! - I give you my word. Gotta hurry. This won't take long. Don't spend all morning here. Morning. What's happening? I thought those freaks were back. - Notice anyone? - No. But you're right to be careful. They told the cops he was into jihad and Syria. Mr. Laur's cousin again? No, the cops came to warn us. They believe that gang? Why wouldn't they? El Alaoui won't be dissuaded. He finds Sélim shady. Isn't it strange El Alaoui hates him so much? From day one? Good thing we're not dealing with his whole race. Isn't he a little hard on Sélim? What do you mean? Maybe he's hiding something. Like what? I don't know, just wondering. I'm on your side. We keep the kid here. He'll stay out of trouble. I'm not necessarily for keeping him. I thought you liked young Arabs. Where'd you get that idea? I wasn't born yesterday. It's not my thing at all. Have a good one. You too. - How are you? - Fine. - And you? - Alright. - Did it go well with the kid? - Yes. - He's still at yours? - I think so. Apparently, he told them jihad is a war on capitalism. The only war. He says stuff like that! That's what set the thugs off. That's what they say. But the cops say they thought he was a narc trying to feel them out. We held our tongues, but I'd get rid of him. He's bad news. What good will that do? The man can live in peace. Why do you all believe those thugs? Someone says "jihad" and you trust them? I trust no one, least of all those kids. - They're trouble. - Sorry. I have to go. - Have a nice day. - Thanks, you too. Yes, hello? - Where are you? - Something came up. - I can't come. - What? It's in 5 minutes! Sorry. I have to deal with something. I can't work like this, Médéric. Shit happens. I haven't really started yet. Be here or you're fired. Florence! That you, Médéric? Back already? I went for nothing. She cancelled. You could've slept in. You're still here? I was about to leave, but we started reading comics. It's 10:30. The shelter won't find itself. He's still healing. No, he's much better. - Can I borrow this? - If you like. Bye. I'm making tea. Want some? Sure. What's wrong? Keep it down next time. I heard you downstairs. Weren't you sick of sex? I was so afraid yesterday that men left me cold I had to try quickly. - Why not with me? - You're different. I love you. Even more after sleeping with Sélim. Except I'm trying to get rid of him. To get his ass in gear. Sex is crucial for that. Now that he's had sex, he'll shine. - He's a virgin? - Hence the jihad. What did he tell you? He didn't use those words, But I think he wanted to die. And after fucking, he doesn't? That's what whores are for. The first time's hard, especially for Muslims. Now he can live normally. He made you moan, a total beginner? Mr. Coq? It's Médéric. Come in. Aren't you looking for a shelter? Did you see the thugs outside? That's why I stopped by. Want a hit? No, thanks. We have to do something. Relax, we'll handle them. Shouldn't we call the police? Kader did, just now. They came and left. They're not bodyguards. They're understaffed. We have to be strong. Show we're not afraid. But if they're armed... Come look. Is that really necessary? An unarmed man is nice. Even unarmed police. I'm not opposed. But thugs have guns. What if they don't? They might want some. They have to see the risk. So they'll think twice. Look, Mr. Coq. You can't give Sélim a gun! He has to defend himself. We still can't be sure. Maybe he's a jihadist. That's hogwash. They think he stole hash. That's why they want him. He should give it back. He stole nothing. They're so dumb, they go after the new guy. Look... Whatever you're planning is a bad idea. - I'll go talk to them. - Think they'll listen? The angrier we get, the less we talk. We'll all end up dead. I just want to talk. Please leave Sélim alone. - He should split. - Our bro died in the attack. He's innocent. He helped them. He's with the jihadists. How do you know that? Then why isn't he in jail? The police give us hell, but not the jihadists. - What did you think? - That's insane. - It's all they care about! - No, they don't. It took them forever to show up. - The city center. - At Christmas time? 10 minutes! 10 minutes, dude. - What's going on? - Take a guess. She's here. I can sense her. You can sense the person you love. Sit down here. Sit down. Go on! We've been together 30 years. I won't let you separate us. You wanted to get laid. I understand. Happens to everyone. And doubtless for her, finding a good lay like you, especially at her age, made her lose her mind. She ignored the consequences. So I don't blame you. It's even flattering knowing a hunk like you is attracted to my wife. But in a week you'll forget her, for me it's true love. I miss her every hour, every minute. That's why you slap her around? Have you been in love? I mean the real thing? Yes. Didn't you flip out when she was who-knows-where. Not caring that you're worried? Yeah. That's no reason to hit her. That's how it is. I can't control it. Other men would do far worse. Send her to the hospital. To keep her on the street? I don't give a fuck! I don't need it. It's her choice. She always liked sex. I like sex too, but I don't hustle. Could you have? Why not? It's not really a guy thing. Of course it is. Ok, I get your drift. You'd give blowjobs for a living? Maybe. If I was a queer. Even guys who revolt you? All guys revolt me! - Even girls who revolt you? - Enough! Now go get her! I dunno where she is. She spent the night here. We had a fight. She left 2 hours ago. A fight about what? I wouldn't leave town with her. Got a monkey wrench or pliers? Our faucet's leaking. Yes. I'll go get one. But I have company. No problem. Hello. I'll return it soon. It's not like I use it every day. I have to pee. Leave your phone. They're still there. Quick! A gift from my husband. I wouldn't be caught dead in it. Try it on. Tell her I love her madly. And I'm fine with her stopping. I just want to talk. You have my number. Even in town you have Darth Vaders. But you say nothing? What's there to say? Exactly. You just let them take over. You want faceless neighbors? No. I agree, but what do I say? What do you mean? You'd tell them to dress differently? I just did. They don't object. - Where'd they go? - She wouldn't tell me. She didn't leave a note? Better not to know. Those Slavic whores are always trouble. She's not Slavic. With a name like that? Want a beer? Yeah, sure. - She hasn't called? - No. Thanks. May I? You don't understand. Those girls have mafia pimps. No, it's just her husband. Even if you kept her, imagine living with a whore, sharing her with other men. - She wants to stop. - They all say that. Those girls love sex. They need endless cock. That's why they're whores. They get older, but never really stop. Don't you like living alone? Free to do as you please? You're young. You have time. There are more urgent matters. A building to defend. We have to hold down the fort. They'll run the neighborhood. Our apartments will be worthless. We'll fight this, together. That's how real friends are made. - And El Alaoui? - Sure. He hasn't forgotten us. He's keeping an eye out. He'll keep me posted. Can I have another? Hotel de France. Charlène here. Thanks. Cheers. - Hello. - Would you like a room, sir? I'm looking for Isadora. We haven't seen her in 2 days. Can't you talk? What do you want? Huh? Don't you know this man? - He's Isadora's lover. - Oh, yes. I remember. She has so many. But he's special, right? You keep your interns late. I wanted more hours. Days I'm too busy. Whereas nights, Mr. Renard has time to teach... Why are you here? I'm looking for her. - At the hotel? - Where else? - Hi Charlène. - Mr. Gérard. I'd rather you not chat here. We'll go downstairs. - I won't be any help. - Wrong. Come. Bring the girl downstairs. - What time was it? - Just after 5. - What'd she want? - Help finding a hideout. Isadora doesn't need you for a hideout! You're lying! Fess up! Calm down. She's just a child. Charleène, tell him. It's normal he wants his wife back. - Well? - She left with another man. A young drifter. Finally... Describe him. Young. 20 years old at most. Does he have dogs? Anything else? - He's Arab. - Christ! Unbelievable. She'll never change. So a homeless Arab shows up and you invite him over, introduce him to Isadora? Do you realize what's been going on? Jihadists kidnap our women and take them home like trophies! A Turkish diplomat stole 2 from a pal. Gone forever! Women are merchandise to them! No! Sélim's no jihadist. How would you know? He's gay. How's that? I was in love with him. He told you he's gay? Yes. He's in love with Mr. Médéric. So he didn't run off with Isadora? Listen, little bitch! Enough with the silly love stories. Now what'd Isadora tell you? Tell me or else! She gave me an address where Mr. Médéric could find her. There. Wait, Charleène! It s too late. I gave him a fake address. Return to the hotel. I'll go. You'll never find her. Could you fix me up with Sélim? - He's in love with me. - Maybe you can help. Please, for me? I'll think about it. Let's go. You mind? She's my wife! Let's go home! Get in. Are we just gonna stand here? Well? Sélim. Take Charlène home. - Can he sleep over? - Yeah. Why not at yours? No. The thugs will be waiting for you. I have to hurry. Wanna get rid of me? No, take Charlène home. Why don't you? I'm busy. Drop it! Look, Sélim. There's nothing between us. Why not? I'm not gay. So? I can just come over, no sex. You'd best go to Charlène's. This footage was captured on a neighbor's smartphone. I figured I should watch your flat. What happened? Check it out. The neighbor filmed it with a Samsung. Amazing quality. It rivals the iPhone. That's me firing! Watch those fuckers run! All that for a bar of hash. What hash? They hid it in the fuse box. - In the building? - In the front hall. Kader wasn't fooled. So Sélim robbed them? No, I did. We live in a society of laws. Vigilantes are not tolerated. - Oh God! - The medics arrived in time. His wife called. He's in critical condition. We usually see this in rough Paris suburbs. Here we're in midsize city centers, far from housing projects. The neighborhood where the violence erupted... Can I ask a favor? Of course. It's not so accurate. But at close range, it's great. It's discreet, so you can get close. How do you mean? With this, you can't. It can't be concealed. Yeah, but... I like this one better. I have better control. I prefer it too. Don't do anything stupid. It's just to intimidate him. Sir? I saw the news report. How awful! Is Médéric Roman home? Come away with me. What's this bullshit? You're going nowhere. Get back! What's your problem? What do you want? What? Whatcha gonna do? I'm waiting. Big mistake, asshole. Let's go. Fuck off! - Stop! - Back off! Stop, Gérard! Fuck him up! Get up! Get up, Médéric! Stop it! You're gonna kill him. You get it now? Come. Let's go. I need to keep an eye on my flat. Then I'll come over. Look, Florence... So you won't be alone. I'd like us to work together, starting next month, but for the rest... For the rest? It's not gonna happen. You're such a square! So we're colleagues, it doesn't mean we can't sleep together. I'm gay. Can't we have sex anyway? I don't want to. I never will. What about Isadora? An exception. See. It's not important. All that's in your head. Maybe, but it's still impossible. We don't have to sleep together. Yeah... No. It's best if you go home. Well, this is us. I'll call an Uber upstairs. The cops might stop me again. Whaddya doing here? I can't stay at Charlène's. Can I stay here? Stay at mine. I'm at Médéric's. You are? After tonight, I can't be alone. Then invite selim. I feel safer with you. You trust him? It's not like we're strangers. Yeah. If you like. Maybe the lady could... Could...? I have a second bedroom. - Yeah. - Why not? Let's go. I'm cold. How about one last drink? A little late. Isn't it? Médéric! Wait for me! Wait! Subtitling TITRAFILM
