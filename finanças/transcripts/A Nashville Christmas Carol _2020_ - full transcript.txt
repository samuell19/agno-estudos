This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. I wrote a letter to Santa last night I told him what I want to make my Christmas right But if I don't get it I'm gonna be blue I want a rockin' little Christmas with you I want a rockin' little Christmas Rockin' little Christmas with you Oh, if I get my wishes It's gonna be delicious A stocking full of love for two Baby, what's it gonna be Where you gonna spend your Christmas Eve Will I be married or will I be blue I want a rockin' little Christmas with you I want a rockin' little Christmas Rockin' little Christmas Rockin' little Christmas with you Cut. Let's set for Blue Christmas. Okay. Great rehearsal, everybody. That was awesome. Keep it up. We've got showtime in six days. I want game speed. All right, we need to make sure that the dancers have rubber grips on the bottom of their shoes, and this window needs way more snow. There's not enough snow. Why are these skirts different colors? They're not. They ran out of deep red. But full red is close enough. "Close enough"? Close enough is a slippery slope. You know what they say about slippery slopes? -Great for sledding? -Luanne. I got it. I got it. Deep red. We also need to call the props guy, make sure that he looks at the digital fireplace. The image is getting very wonky. You got all that? Pen's gonna run out of ink. Appreciate your hard work, Georgia. I'm gonna miss you when you go to law school in the spring. Right. Um... about the song and the opener, people have been talking. Who? Okay, it's just me. Don't you think that the opening song should be a classic? Uh, too much baggage. Sure, "Deck the Halls" is rife with angst. Okay, every song has a memory. So we want people to tune in and hear "Rockin' Little Christmas" and think of nothing other than how much they loved this year's Country Christmas Live. To tape. Okay, also, Alexis' manager called. She wants fruit in her trailer, but no pineapple. Absolutely no pineapple. I think she's allergic. I was looking for Belinda Manners. Behind a giant candy cane? Where is she, the North Pole? Try the gingerbread house. Could I have your autograph? Oh. You were serious. Thanks. There you go. Thanks. Belinda Manners. Christmas come early. -Gavin. -How are you? Oh, I thought you got stuck in L.A. I did, but Santa gave me a ride on his sleigh. You crushed this rehearsal. This was fantastic. Aw, you're just saying that. Twelve years your manager. You think I still lie to you? Well, I think your talents have been wasted by having me as your only client. Thank you, but I think you've kept me pretty busy. Besides, after booking the opening spot on Country Christmas Live, you're gonna be a lot busier. Hey, speaking of which, can you help me with something? Anything. It's about the giant Holly Jollies... -Billboard. Yeah. -...billboard. Is it not just a little distracting? It's a lot distracting. I'll take care of it. I mean, I know it's Vivienne's call. Yes, it is. Mm-hmm. We're professionals. I actually have a meeting with her tomorrow morning. -Really? -Yes. Listen. I know how important this opening number is to you, so don't worry. It's gonna be a wonderful experience. You deserve it. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Okay, Alexis is up next. How are we doing? She's almost ready. -Great. -It's my fault, Vivienne. I've been so nervous I can't stop fidgeting. What? Alexis Rinehart nervous? Who would believe it? My first album just came out, and there's all these expectations. The most people I've sung for is church. I wouldn't have booked you if I didn't know you could do it. Okay? Open your heart to them and they'll open theirs to you. You know, Gavin's in town. I figured. He asked if you two could talk. Goodie. I told him to meet you tomorrow morning in the Hall of Fame museum. Why the museum? I thought you two could use some privacy. Okay. Uh, this meeting should be done soon. I'll see you at home. Looks like a blast, Dad. Oh, it sure is. Thank you girls so much for this cruise. -Thank Vivienne. -No, that was... Dad, that was from both of us, and just get back safely in time for Christmas Eve. Hey, I'll be the one with the sunburn. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not still working, are you? Bye, Dad. Chat soon. He's right. You should try sleeping every now and then. I will make that a New Year's resolution. I always went to bed when you told me to. Big sister. Perks of the job. What are these? Resumes. Oh, yeah? Who are you hiring? My replacement. Vivienne. Okay, I heard from my friend at the network I am on the short list to produce the Icon Music Awards, So? Do both shows. I can't. I'd have to move to L.A. the first week of January. I'm sorry. Did you say you're moving to L.A.? If I got the job, which I won't. But probably. You're serious. You'd really leave? Well, it's the IMAs, Georgia. I can't turn down an opportunity like that. Besides, you're going to law school. I could sell the house. Dad could visit us anywhere. What exactly am I leaving behind here? A lifetime of memories? Okay, you can't get sentimental about this kind of stuff, Georgia. That's when people take advantage of you. What about what you said to Alexis? Mm. Seemed pretty sentimental to me. Please. I just told a scared young girl what she needed to hear. Oh... Country Christmas Live got its start three decades ago with executive producer Marilyn Jinway. Until her death two years ago, country Christmas Live had won over 12... The Marilyn Jinway. Yeah, my old boss. Taught me everything I know. I heard she was a handful. Well, the special was on its last legs. She had to be tough. Besides, she never let personal feelings get in the way of business. Even when the business is personal? You look good. Excuse me? You look good. You look different. Good different/ Well, I grew up. Well, it's been a while. Has it? It has. I can't say I get back very often, so... Hmm. You manage a country music superstar but don't make it back to Nashville? Listen, I-I should have called, and I wanted to... Look, we don't need to get into any of this. No, no, I-I just got the sense that you didn't really want to talk. Well, yeah. Not talking would be great. So then we can work together and have it not be awkward. See? Not awkward at all. So what was it you wanted? -The opening number. -What about it? It needs a dog. I'm sorry, a d... a dog? A dog. Belinda is involved with several rescue animal shelters, and we feel it would tie into that perfect Christmas vibe, so... a dog. Okay, I'll look into it. Thank you. Is there something else? Nothing major, except that the billboard is a major distraction. Yeah, no, no chance. Sponsor broke the piggy bank for that billboard, so not going anywhere. The billboard belongs on Broadway outside of a honky-tonk. The billboard stays, so... if there's anything else you need, ask Georgia, okay? -Hey, boss. -Hmm? You okay? What? Yeah, uh, late night. Could always wrap early today. Hilarious. What is this? No clue. Um... Well, did you see who dropped it off? Music box. -For the Toyland sketch. -Maybe. "O Come All Ye Faithful". I'm sorry, what? The song. I don't hear anything. Parker, the song coming from the music box. Vivienne, I, uh... I don't hear anything. Okay, put it in the prop room. -I'll look at it later. -Yeah, yeah, okay. How'd it go with Gavin? Great, yeah. He came around to my way of thinking on the billboard, so that was good. The billboard? Vivienne, I meant how was it talking to Gavin one-on-one for the first time in a decade? I don't know what you're talking about. Sure you don't. Anyway, that head honcho you were telling me about, what was his name? Grass? Moss. Henry Moss. Runs the whole network. what about him? He's here. What...? Mr. Moss? Ah, you must be Vivienne Wake. Yes. Pleasure to meet you. Likewise. To what do we owe this honor? I'm only used to working with people in the Nashville office. Well, I heard good things, wanted to come down and see for myself. I'm flattered. In fact, several board members flagged you for a project in L.A. Really? I trust you won't mind if I linger a bit? Watching you work? No, of course not. Um... Stacy? Hi. Can you find an empty dressing room for Mr. Moss, please? Oh, please, call me Henry. - Henry. - Okay. I mean, first Gavin, now I have the head of the network breathing down my neck? At least they're giving you the job, right? I don't know. -They wouldn't be here if... -I said I don't know. Okay. Um... These are real. We get hungry while we're working. So we're just leaving cookies out all day now? No, we just thought that... Okay, this is not the jug that we... decided on. We had some extra paint. Okay. Do I have to do everything myself? I'm gonna go wash my hand. I'm sorry. It's okay. Mom. Gavin. So glad you made it to Nashville in one piece. Yeah. Thank you. So far, so good. We're still on for dinner tonight, though, right? Yeah. Yeah. Soon as I'm done with work. "Work", he calls it. Heard that. Your father's excited to see you too. Ooh. Mom, can I call you back? Uh, yeah. Come hungry. Henry. Hey. It's Gavin Chase, Belinda's manager. Hello? What? Hey, kid. Merry Christmas to you, too. Marilyn? You're-you're... You can do it. Four letters. Starts with D. Okay, this is not funny. Who are you? The song in this music box was playing the night we met, remember? Not a great party. But the eggnog was great. Okay, this cannot be happening. They warned me you might have a tough time with this. Georgia was right. I'm-I'm not getting enough sleep. She said... -Hey. -The paint. The paint. I must have inhaled the fumes and... Okay, stop, stop. This isn't a dream. So you're... You're real. -Mm-hm. -What are you doing here? I'm here to keep you from ending up like me. You're my idol. Why wouldn't I want to be like you? Because when the time comes to roll the credits on your life, you'll remember that it's the names that are important, not the work. I don't understand. I didn't expect you to. That's where we come in. "We"? A tough nut needs a tough nutcracker. So I've recruited a few of my friends. Well, hello, darlin'. Allow me to introduce to you the Spirit of Christmas Past. Marilyn tells me you've gone off the trail. I figure the best way to find out why is to go see where you took a wrong turn along the way. See? He has southern wisdom. I love that. This-this is really happening. Mm-hm. You were a friend to me when I didn't have many, so this is my way of saying thank you. There's so much I want to say. Save it. They used to do all of this in one night. We have five. Though I still feel like we're pushing it. Have fun, you two. Are you... Candy cane? I'm sorry, uh, Mister... Past, or what do I call you? Well, the full name is "Spirit of Christmases Which Have Come Before". Friends call me Pat. Pat. Perfect. Uh, hey, so I produce a Christmas special, Country Christmas Live. Maybe you've heard of it. Anyway, we tape in less than a week, so I would really appreciate it if you could get me back to the studio, because I don't... I, uh... Well, no can do, darlin'. See, you and I are going on a tour... of your past. What is it you like to say? "Every song has a memory." Wait, I'm... not cold. Well, you're not really here. What? Where... am I? I'm not cold. Well, you're not really here. -What? -I mean, you're not here now. Where am I? You'll get it. What is that? Are you ready? That's me. Little Viv. Ten, going on 45. That's the first camera I ever got. I got it for Christmas that year. This must be... Gavin, the snowman needs a hat. What? Why? Every snowman has to have a hat. The show's gonna be ruined. Not that kind of hat. What? Who says snowmen can't be cowboys? -Hey there. -Yes. They can't see you. Think of it like you're watching a really big TV. I'm about to roll. You ready, Georgia? Mm-hm. Georgia. Up on the housetop reindeer pause Out jumps good old Santa Claus Down through the chimney with lots of toys Okay, tell me this is not the cutest thing you have ever seen. Ho, ho, ho, who wouldn't go Ho, ho, ho Hey, I've seen a lot. Definitely cracks the top five. Down through the chimney with old Saint Nick Look how much you loved putting on a show. Oh, dear Santa, fill it well I still do. Why do you think I work 16-hour days? Give her a dolly that laughs and cries If you asked that little girl, would she tell you she's working? Merry Christmas. Cut. I can't wait for Mom and Dad to see it. They're gonna love it! Our first show was a success. We'll have to do something huge to top it next year. Wait, we're doing this again next year? Well, yeah. I mean, who else would I do it with? Oops. I forgot I hit stop. Wait, wait. My name's Gavin Chase, and I'm ten years old. My best friend's name is Vivienne, and I hope we're best friends forever. What? It was just acting, like in a movie. I know. The tape was full, anyways. Vivienne, come in for some peppermint brittle. Okay, Mom. Oh, well, see ya. -See ya. -See ya. That was your last Christmas together as a family. Yeah. My mom left that March. I know how hard it was for you. That girl... she has no idea what's in store for her. I have to warn her. -She can't hear you. -I have to warn her! No, no, no, no, no. This isn't right This-this was next year. Dad, look! It's the dollhouse I wanted from Santa. You must have been really good this year. Do you see, Vivienne? I do. That's so cool. You had to grow up really fast. Wasn't a big deal. Your dad did his best. He was on his own. You two always made sure little Georgia had something really special under that tree, even when you didn't. I'll make it up to you on your birthday, then. I promise. It's okay. We're a team, right? -Right. -Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas, sweetie. Why are you showing me this? That, darlin', is for you to decide. What? Wait, you can't just leave like... Whoa. Pat? Pat? Oh, Vivienne, girl, you are losing it. It's true. There you are. Henry. Hi. I had a chance to mull it over, and I love your and Gavin's idea. I'm sorry, I've had a long morning. Which-which idea was this? Adding a dog to the opening number. Wow, he, uh, he told you about that. He did. I think it's wonderful. That is... That is great. Um, could you just excuse me for one moment? Oh, yeah, sure. Go right ahead. Gavin? Can I talk to you for a minute? Outside? -Sure. -Now. One second. Why didn't you wait for my answer? Oh, you seemed open to the idea of a dog. I said I'd look into it. I looked into it for you. Do you...you don't like dogs? I love dogs. Everybody loves dogs. That is not the point. What's the point? The point is you went over my head to my boss. That is completely inappropriate. Okay. You're right. Fine. I did. But I did it for Belinda and for the production, so.. Sorry. Fine. Just... next time come to me before Mr. Moss. -Fine. I will. -Thank you. -About the dog... -Oh, my gosh. You said it yourself. Everyone loves dogs. Okay, no, I do not have time to explain this to you right now. Okay, I need to...I am late to get to a meeting for the wrap party. -Great. I'll go with you. -Right. Country Christmas Live. It's not actually live. So why couldn't you shoot one version with the dog and one without and then just... cut them together? Well, because it needs to feel live to our audience. That was Marilyn's biggest rule. We need to pretend like we are going into people's living rooms. So what are we doing here? Well, this is where we are having the crew wrap party. I'm supposed to be planning it, but I'm way behind. This looks super familiar. I think I've been here before. -You have. -I have. Chet Walder's Christmas party. Okay. Um, look, I, uh... I owe you an apology. For sort of going over your head to your boss. Oh, was that "sort of" going over my head to my boss? Fine. I was a jerk. So maybe we can make a deal. If you could find a way to put a dog in Belinda's opening number, I will put together your entire crew party for you. What, you like, moonlight as an event planner too? Absolutely. Album release parties, charity balls, birthday parties, and all without a single noteworthy disaster, so... Look, let me... let me take this off your plate. Okay. I get to pick the dog. See? We make a great team. My parents. I'm supposed to meet them for dinner, so... Please, go. Go, go. I promise I will not retract our great dog compromise. Sounds good. I did want to ask... Why'd you give Belinda the opening number? It's the biggest part of the show. You weren't very happy with me, so... why give her that opportunity? Because she is the best. See you. Oh, wait, Gavin! Wait! You forgot your scarf. Vivienne! Viv. Hey. Gavin? Vivienne, hey. Are...are you coming tonight? What kind of Nashvillian would I be if I missed the Nashville Christmas Festival, huh? Oh, my gosh. Love the hair. Anybody tell you it's rude making somebody time travel without asking them first? Better to ask for forgiveness than permission in this case. I...I could pick you up, if you'd like. What, like a date? No, no, well... Oh, my gosh, I'm kidding. You're blushing so hard. I'm...I'm... My shoot might be going late, so I'll just meet you there, okay? Uh, yeah, no, that sounds great. Okay. Gavin sure seems sweet on you. Gavin? No. No. We were just really good friends. Mm-hm. Hey, don't lose that scarf. We got a lot more to see. -Santa. -Shh. Mm. These are from Ms. Marjorie's Cookie Company. Mm. Maybe I'll stick around. I'm sure the other kids won't mind getting presents on the 26th. Cut! That was perfect! Almost. That was a great laugh. Energy, love it. I certainly had plenty of confidence. Hey, even back then, you knew what you wanted. You knew how to make it happen. ...what you're doing. Um, when he takes the bite of... Why me? Why now? Hey, if a needle falls out of its groove, it just needs a little nudge to get back into place. Just keep your cheeks rosy. Keep the energy up, and let's go again. When you say things like that, it makes way less sense than you think. Sorry I can't pay up front. With all the new business, I promise. Oh, no, Ms. Marjorie, I already told you, do not even worry about it. Nashville needs you and I'm happy to help any way I can. Boy, was I naive. I didn't even get paid. Well, not then. Your commercial did a real treat for Ms. Marjorie's business. She made you whole. And you haven't paid for so much as a macadamia nut since. Yeah, well, that's Ms. Marjorie. Ms. Marjorie is not the real world. You know, I have a grandson around your age. Would love for you two to meet. That is, if you're not already spoken for. Oh, I, am... so flattered, Ms. Marjorie, but... I think I do already have someone. Ooh. And who might that have been? Don't know. This was a long time ago. Mm-hm. Sure. Mm. Thanks for the peppermint brittle. So tell me about the singer. Okay. Belinda Manners is her name. Super talented. Uh, she's looking for a manager. We're actually meeting on Monday, only for her to tell me I'm not it. Why would she say that? I've never managed anybody. And I'm an assistant at a talent agency. Okay, no. You just tell her that you are the smartest, hardest-working, most loyal person she'll ever meet, and she should be so lucky to have you as her manager. Can...can you be my manager? Do you want to play this? Oh, you're going down. You're the one with the pressure, okay? -All right. -Thank you. There you go. I want the green. -Okay. You ready? -Okay. What makes matters worse is I talked to my dad. He still thinks this is a giant waste of time and I should quit the music business and join his construction firm. Mm-mm. You live your life, not his. Nice shot. -Oh. -I mean, if I can get just one, one successful artist, he would not think this is a waste of time. This is for the win. - Oh! - Boom! So, so loud. Oh. Thank you. There's so many people I need to thank. What is this? Victory speech. No, not that. What is this compared to that? Second place. Watch what this does for this jacket. Wow. You're so fancy. -Thank you. -That's very chic. I need some peppermint brittle. And that's what happy looks like. That's a lot... Okay, I can't... I can't concentrate anymore. -Does it look good? -Yes. And I want to ask a question. -Okay, so... -So... If Belinda Manners does sign with you... Okay. You're going to need promotional material for her, right? Right. Which would mean if she has a music video, you will need someone to direct your music videos, correct? Mm-hm. Look, I know I don't have a ton of experience, but you know I would make it amazing. Vivienne. If I just had the right opportunity. The job's yours. -Really? -The job's yours. -I promise. -Why? There's a lot of dreamers out there. Most people can't make those dreams become a reality. You can. Hey. Uh, hi. Excuse me. Can you take our.... ...picture? To remember this moment. Just push there. Is this going back on? -Your choice. -All right. -Mm. -I think it's a good look. There we go. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Okay, let's see. -Let's see it. What? Just friends? We ate peppermint brittle and played carnival games together. That is what friends do. I can see why Marilyn asked for help. Hmm. You know, you are stubborn as a mule. Um, excuse me. I do not appreciate your tone. You get focused on something and you just can't see anything else. That... You didn't even notice you dropped Gavin's scarf. -Shoot. -It's all right. I grabbed it for you. Don't say I never gave you anything. Hey, wait. Hey. Get back here! Viv. -Hey. -Hey. Who, uh, who were you talking to? Oh, no one. I was, uh, trying to remember something, you know? "Get back here in my brain, you rascally memory." Okay. Um, I forgot my scarf, so... Yeah, no, here. Don't wanna forget that. Yeah. -You good? -Yeah. -Okay. See you later. -Bye. Careful. Gavin thinks you've lost your marbles. You did that on purpose. Did what? You stopped at the good part, when everything was fine. Show what happens next. That part's not as fun. Yeah, no kidding. It's your rodeo. Gavin said this was a Christmas part. There's a red carpet. Red's a Christmas color. Oh, g... Everybody looks so shiny. It's like they're glazed, Georgia. Glazed. Look, Mr. Big Shot throwing the party wants to sign Belinda to his label, right? Right. So, if that happens, you'll finally get to direct that music video you've been talking non-stop about for the past year. Just try to relax, okay? I'm sure this'll be one of the best nights of your life. I gotta go. I love you, Georgia. I love you too. I won't wait up. Who's got two thumbs and is ready for shrimp cocktail? This guy. Oh, no. I'm really underdressed, aren't I? No. You look great. -You ready? -Yeah. Let's do it. -You remember this night? -Yup. That was without a doubt the worst night of my life. Thank you. Thank you. Wow. This is amazing. Wow. -Oh, there he is. -Who? -Chet. -Who? Walder, the head of Galaxy Records. Right. Yes. You're currently at his Christmas party. Sorry, I forgot. I'm nervous. How did you...what are you nervous about? There's nothing to be nervous about. If I may say, there's no one I'd rather be here with than you. -Oh. -Mm-hm. You know, it's a shame you wasted your plus one on me. This kind of party could really impress a girl. You're not impressed? Oh, I think he's coming over. -He's not coming over... -I think... -Oh, no, he's coming over. -Yeah. You're Gavin Chase, right? Chet Walder. Yeah, no, I know. Thanks. This is amazing. Thanks for having us. Oh, this is a little hoot. Yeah, it's nothing. Uh... Ugly Christmas sweater. Hilarious. Oh, this isn't... Your hands look cold. Let me grab you a drink, so we can warm you up a little bit. That's okay. You don't have to right now. -It's...it's fine. -Sure I do. You are the manager for Galaxy Records' newest artist, right? What? What? Welcome to Chet's Galaxy. What? Oh, yes! Can you excuse me one second? I have to tell her... -Go. Go, go, go, go. -Just one second. One second. -You did it. -Wait, what? -You did it. -No. We did it. -It's a great party. -Huh? The party, it's good. Oh, yeah, thanks. So I know that this isn't really the time, but I've got some great ideas for Belinda's first music video. I think you're really gonna love them. Oh. Uh, you're Gavin's little director friend. "Little director friend"? Yeah, so, uh, we talked about it, and that's a no-go on you directing the music video. It's, uh, it's gonna set the tone for the whole rollout. You understand. Gavin said he already talked to Belinda. Yeah. Gavin's a smart guy. He'll know this is for the best. And now one with just Belinda. Yeah, yeah, of course. -What's up? -Did you know about this? -About what? -The music video. What about it? Well, Chet said that it's too important to give to your "little director friend". -Whoa, whoa. -No... All I said was that we should go with someone with a little more experience. I expect you to back me up on this, Gavin. He has a...he has a point. It's her first video, and I mean, we could probably get her on, you know, one down the road. -We'll talk about it. -Yep. Yeah. I'll work on getting you a job on the set of this one. Oh, you'd get me a job on the set? You'd do that for me? Can you work with me here? You told me that everything was gonna be... Vivienne, you know how important this is to me, okay? You've gotten everything you want, even since we were kids. So can you compromise this once? I just believed you had my back. You know what? You have fun in Chet's Galaxy. Vivienne. Vivienne. Don't cry in the eggnog, kid. It's the best thing about this party. I'm not...I'm not crying. Oh. My bad. Beats craft service. You work in production? Television. You ever see Country Christmas Live? Uh, yeah. But what happened last year, though? White Christmas and Silent Night back to back? Were they trying to put us to sleep? I wish we had. Maybe then they wouldn't have changed the channel. Who are you? Oh, I'm nobody. No, you're not. I don't talk to nobodies. I'm Vivienne Wake. You in TV? Sort of. I, um... I've directed a couple things. Just real tiny. Anything I would have seen? Well, I did this small commercial for Ms. Marjorie's Cookie Company. Oh, with Santa. That was a good spot. And you did that by yourself? Mm-hm. Marilyn Jinway. I'm s... The Marilyn Jinway. Wow. You've won, like, four Emmys. Five, but one was daytime, so we'll call it four and a half. You're also... Executive producer of Country Christmas Live, which I believe you said put you to sleep? I am so sorry. Honestly, I... I watch your show every year. I study your show. Thanks, kid. It's okay. You're right. I should have split the songs. So what brings you to Chet Walder's Christmas party, Vivienne Wake? I came with a friend... or so I thought. You know what? Come with me. Wow. So this is it, huh? This is where Country Christmas Live comes to life? That's the idea. We're part of people's lives. Not everybody understands what's at stake with that. I do. Look, you can't let your feelings get in the way with business, kid. No one else will. I learned that the hard way. Sounds like you did, too. Sorry. Is that your friend? Yeah. Hmm. He's looking out for him. Maybe it's time you started looking out for you. How would you like to have a job? Working for you? No. Shoeing reindeer. Yes, working for me. Um... Yeah! I would...I, uh... Yes, please. I would love... I would love a job. Gavin broke his promise. He didn't even try to stand up for me. Doesn't that mean anything? That was years ago. Yet it feels like yesterday. Mm-mm-mm. I smell that peppermint all the way from Tahiti. We're doing our best. No topping yours, Dad. Look, you and Gavin were best friends. You shouldn't let one little mistake spoil that. One mistake? After he broke his promise of not letting me do the video, two weeks later, he moved to L.A. without a single goodbye. Fine. Two mistakes. And as he was stabbing me in the back, he had the nerve to say that I'm the one who always has to get my way. Can you believe that? What? You can be... slow to compromise. Tsk. No, I'm not. Oh, really? So, you wouldn't care if I put three quarters of a cup of sugar in this batch instead of two thirds? That's not what the directions say, though, Geor...gia. Look at it this way. Are you the same person you were ten years ago? Not even close. Of course not. Because people change. Give Gavin a chance to prove that he's changed, too. I will try. -Belinda? -Yes? Alexis. What's going on? It's a real honor to perform on the same show as you. You've been my hero since I was a kid. You're very kind. I'm a little nervous. Petrified, actually. Any advice? Yeah. If you forget the lyrics, just keep dancing. Come on. It's one night. There'll be mulled cider. When you are finishing law school, you will be so happy I worked so hard. Pretty please, with whipped cream and a sugarplum on top? Georgia, really, I... Consider it my Christmas present? I've already gotten you your Christmas present. Okay. Next year's, then. Okay, so Parker will be taking care of the base of the billboard. What do you feel about snow in the foreground? Like, right next to the camera. You know, the last two days I've been haunted by my dead boss and the Spirit of Christmas Past. Cool. Okay, you begged me to come out. Would have thought you'd be a little bit more present. I'm sorry. You're right. Are you expecting somebody? What? No. Gavin. Hey. How's it going? I didn't know both you guys would be here. Feeling's mutual. How about you, Georgia? You expect to see Gavin? I don't know what you're talking about. -No? -Oh. Look at that. I'm out of cider. I'll, uh... I'll be right back. -Mind if I... -Sure. It's good to see you. Glad to see you're getting some time to relax. Mm. Believe me, it is against my will. Georgia was very insistent. Is that right? So, um, you guys were... Wow. Oh, wow. I have so many messages about tomorrow. I should... I mean, it's getting late. Can you tell Georgia that I'll just meet her at home? -Sure. -Okay. Have fun. Remember when we were kids, around this time of year? What our conversations were always about? We compared Christmas lists? That's right. Remember why? To make sure we wouldn't have the same things. Yeah. So that we could borrow whatever the other person didn't get. We talked about music a lot. We did. I took you to your first record store. And I introduced you to Loretta Lynn. I got you her autograph. And I bought us tickets to her show. You liked me more than I liked you. Wow. Um, I'm sorry. I may have been the more generous friend, obviously, but you, you were the one buying me peppermint brittle at the Christmas Festival. You remember that. Yeah. Yeah. Uh... Things have been jogging my memory lately. So did it jog your memory about your second-place finish? It jogged my memory about that obscenely large snowman you got for a beanbag toss. You rigged that game. -I did not rig that. -You rigged it. There is no way you could have gotten such a huge snowman... -I was three for three. -...compared to my tiny nose. It was huge. The cat hated me. You called her "Emmylou Hairless". Oh, that was one of my better ones. I did. How's your dad doing, by the way? He's been good. He's in Tahiti right now. -I'm...I'm sorry, Tahiti? -Yeah. We all spend Christmas together, but since December's so busy, it's just easier for us to, you know, send them on vacation. Wow. James Wake, man of the high seas, huh? Yeah. Never good at sitting still. Yeah. Kind of like you. What do you mean? You met Chet. And then... two weeks later, you move to L.A. and... you're floating around in Chet's Galaxy. I should have fought harder for you. Look, I shouldn't have brought this up. -No, I'm... -I'm sorry. I'm glad you did. Vivienne. I think about that night a lot. I didn't want to miss that opportunity when that door opened. -I was afraid if it... -Hey, you...Gavin, Gavin. You did what you needed to do for your career. It's fine. Okay? I get it. So listen, crew has tomorrow off. I was wondering if you might want to get together. Cultivate a little holiday cheer? I don't know. You know, I'm gonna have to pass. I still have so much to get done. -It's no problem. -Uh, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, darling. Hey, would you mind just grabbing a cab real quick? I will be right back. One minute. Fallen on hard times? You know, I'm more studied on yesterdays than tomorrows. But why would you be skipping out on a day with Gavin? You saw it. When push comes to shove, Gavin chose his career over our friendship. Nothing comes from mixing the two but hurt feelings, so... Well, it's a funny thing. But you know, you'll hear a song a thousand times, and then one day you hear a whole different tune. -You did it. You did it. -Wait, what? What? You're signed. -What? -You have a record deal. -No way! -This is gonna be huge for you. I can't do this without you. The good news is you don't have to. -Gavin. -Huh? I think tonight is the night. For what? You need to tell Vivienne how you feel, how you really feel. You're right. I'm going to. Belinda. Gavin. -Want to take a photo? Sure. -sure. What does he mean, "tell me how he feels"? Oh, I think you know. You know what? You have fun in Chet's Galaxy. Vivienne. -Vivienne. -Hey, wait, wait, wait. -Where are you going? -Chet, Gavin, let's get you two. She's upset, so I'm gonna go talk to her. Smile, G-Man. You want my advice? Let her go. You're at the top of the mountain, and some of your old friends may not like the air. Maybe consider giving her a chance. She's super talented. Look. Maybe I didn't make myself clear. I call the shots, okay? Hey. If you can't get on board with that, then maybe... Belinda Manners isn't right for Galaxy Records after all. Okay, well, I have to explain this to her. Knock yourself out. You know, Gavin called and called, but you never answered. When Chet offered him a chance to leave, he had to consider if there was as much keeping him in Nashville as he thought. You hearing a different tune? He did stand up for me. Oh, God. I must look pretty stupid, huh? Not stupid. It's just humans got more heart than sense. Hey, that's why us spirits love y'all so much I'll see you around? No. I'm afraid this marks the end of our road, darling. Wow. I kind of want to, like, hug you or something. Is that a thing? Hey. Thank you for everything. You're welcome. And say hey to my friend. Your friend? Oh, yeah. You don't think I'm the only spirit Marilyn asked for help? Oh, boy. Oh, yeah. Merry Christmas, Pat. Merry Christmas, darling. Well, I thought you might have fallen into another dimension. Hey, I think I will take that day off tomorrow. -Really? -Yeah. Why not? Let's create some holiday cheer. Let's. Have a good night. Must be a really good guitar player. Okay, so I didn't make a plan because I thought we could throw in some ideas, see what options we have, but maybe we can start from over here, -work our way...what? -Vivienne. Producer hat. Okay. -What... -It's still going. Relax. Enjoy yourself. -Have some fun, okay? -Okay. Okay. -No more work. -No more. Okay. You do have a plan though, right? -I do have a plan. -Okay, good. Good. So I don't mean for this to be a competition, but... No, we've got that Blue Christmas segment, and I feel like a wreath is a perfect idea. I'm sorry. You have a Blue Christmas what? Segment. What? A Blue Christmas segment. And that would be for... -Work. -Work. Hmm. Is this Vivienne's day off today? I...I thought it was. I could be wrong. -I got an idea. -Okay. There's this Blue Christmas segment... Yes. I say go with the flow. Blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue, blue. Oh, look at this guy. Look, all these guys deserve some love, but look, this is my favorite. -These handmade ones. -Uh-huh. See where the chisel made these grooves? These cuts right here? -Oh, yeah. -I love that. Oh, your dad used to make ones like this, right? Yeah. He sure did, for me and my mom. What? It's amazing, I... I think he thinks I'm gonna wake up one day and just... have the realization that this entire music business is just a terrible idea. You know, I just... I don't understand it. Have you ever told him how that makes you feel? I wouldn't consider Dad a listener. Whether he listens or not is not up to you, but at least you'll know you tried. -Right? -I guess so. How big's your tree? I don't have one. -Excuse me? -Yeah, no, I brought some home, but I keep finding spots for them in the show. -I'll see myself out. -What are...what are you... How do you not have a tree? I keep finding spots for them in the show. Welcome, you two. We have some lovely his and her ornaments right over there in the corner. -Oh, we're not... uh... -Yeah... This one's catching my eye, though. Well, a man of taste, I see. That is a fine instrument. Is it in tune? It is not. I'll take it anyway. -I'll take this. -Thank you. Hey, Lisa. -Hi. -Gavin Chase. Lisa. It's so nice to finally meet you. Wonderful to meet you as well. I'm sorry, "finally"? Oh, Gavin is more than generous every year. -Stop. -Really? I thought you moved to L.A. and forgot about little old Nashville. Ah, well, there's a lot you don't know. The kids were just practicing their caroling. You guys are carolers? Yeah. You...you mind if we... we hear a little bit? I mean, I'm in the music business. There could be a record deal in it for you. -sure. -Okay. Fa-la-la-la-la, oh, fa-la-la-la-la Oh, fa-la-la-la-la, oh, fa-la-la-la-la Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Don we now our gay apparel I want to say thank you again. I mean, you make a lot of kids' Christmases really special. Well, I get plenty of help, from people like Vivienne, for example. Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la -Really? -Mm-hm. 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la Apparently, she had some tough Christmases growing up. She sure did. She's a special person. Yeah, she is. Toll the ancient Yuletide carol Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la So what was the final verdict on Vivienne's day off? It was nice. Yeah, you know, in a couple years, I might even try it again. Hey, you know, I was thinking, um... Growing up, you heard me complain about my dad a lot. I never heard you complain once. And it couldn't have been easy with it being just your dad and your sister. One year I did burn the peppermint brittle, so that was pretty tough. That's tough. It was. All right. See you tomorrow? Yeah. Bright and early. All right. Gavin? It was hard sometimes, but... I always knew I'd be okay because of the people I care about. There you are, sugar. Have fun? Who are you, and... what are you doing in my house? Oh, that doggone Pat. He said he told you about me. Pat. Wait, you're... The Spirit of Christmas Present. Why? Were you expecting somebody else? The Spirit of Christmas Present. What does that mean, exactly? Well, Pat covers the stuff that already happened. I cover the stuff happening now. Oh, dear. Did you think present meant, like...like a gift? That happens all the time. No, no, no, no. I was just wondering. Well, isn't here the present, so... Don't really need a spirit to get me here. That is a good point, sugar. What could you possibly need little old me for? Catch. Huh. Georgia says I work too much. Look who's here on her day off. I don't think she's working... No. Parker and Georgia? How long has this been going on? Don't ask me. I'm just the Spirit of Christmas Present, not the Spirit of the Last Six and a Half Months. Six and a half months?! Excuse me! Excuse me, young lady. -Hello? -She can't hear you. Same rules apply. Okay, a secret romance on my set, that is bad enough, but my own sister? Can you blame her for not saying anything? Yes! Yes, I absolutely can blame her. She probably thought you'd react... well, like this. She's my sister. She can tell me anything. She knows that. -Hey, Vivienne. -Huh? Catch. Cheap trick. Oh, I missed doing this. You had time to get a tree and go on a date? Um, yeah. But it wasn't a date. Sorry, casual day reconnecting with your childhood sweetheart. Old friend. You couldn't let me have any fun? -He's not like I remember. -Really? How so? He's more mature. Selfless. Okay. More handsome. -I knew it. -Nothing has changed, though. You cannot mix personal feelings with work. It is the first thing that Marilyn taught me and it has served me well. I'm your sister and I work for you. Isn't that mixing personal feelings and work? Not the same thing. Why? Because you boss me around anyways? Mm-hm. What about you? What, uh... What did you do on your day off? Me? Uh, nothing much. Nothing you want to tell me about? Um... -There was something. -Yeah? I don't want to go to law school. -What? -I love working for you. -No, Georgia... -I could come on full time. This business, it's unreliable. No. -You manage. -Manage. Exactly. I mean, all Dad and I have ever wanted for you is stability. If this is because of Parker... Wait, you know about Parker? Y-yeah, of course. Of course I know about Parker. I mean, do you think that there's anything on my set that I don't know about? I was going to tell you. Why didn't you? I was afraid you'd get mad. He means a lot to me. Hey. First of all, you can always tell me anything. You're my sister, okay? And second, if... If Parker makes you happy, then that's all that matters. Really? Really. Just... promise me you'll keep thinking about law school. Okay. I will. Thank you. Oh, it's on. Oh, I see you...a handful?! Handful? No, no! No, no, no! Oh! Is this our guy? This the doggy thespian? Hey, buddy. -This is him. -How are you? How's it going? How was rehearsal? Rehearsal was great. It needs a big... I don't know, cymbal crash when Santa comes in. I don't know. What do you think? Oh, yeah. Um... I'll tell the composer. Uh, well, I definitely wanted to get your opinion on it. Go right ahead. I trust your judgment. Look who we have. This is our star of the opening act. Vivienne. Uh, Henry. Hi. I've just about seen enough. Oh, Henry, if things have been weird, I... Enough to know that we need you in charge of the IMAs. What? I...I don't know what to say. Um, thank you. Thank you. Uh, just one thing. Hm. Anything. Of course. Swap Belinda Manners with Alexis Rinehart for the opening number. What? Belinda's the past. Alexis' the future. Board feels we should reflect that. But you've seen Belinda rehearse. She's terrific. And she'll be equally terrific in a different spot. The show's tomorrow, Henry. I don't think that there's enough time... You're resourceful. I'm sure you'll manage. Belinda and Gavin, they'll...they'll just... they'll be devastated. Vivienne, you'll have a lot of difficult conversations working for the IMAs Now, if you can't handle this, maybe you weren't the producer I thought you were. Uh, just a second! Now, I know you invited me over to talk work, but there's a nasty rumor going around that you have a tree that needs decorating. Gavin, it's really important... Oh, no, no. Tree first. Then work. Excuse me. I cannot wait for you to see the crew party. Oh, I usually dread those. I mean, they're always the night before we film, so I spend the entire party stressed to the max, but... this year I'm a little... a little excited. What changed? I've been shown a new perspective. -Is that right? -Mm-hm. All right. Your house. You ready? Ready. ...to admit you're happy I brought the decorations over? I can't...I can't...no. Admit it. I cannot admit that... until I see the star on the tree. Mm-hm. Very lovely. Beautiful. Um... -Gavin, I invited... -Real quick. These last couple days, I mean, I don't know how or why or what's going on between us, but... for me it feels like... like it did back when we were kids. You know? And I honestly didn't know how much I... We're replacing Belinda with Alexis for the opening number. Huh? She still has her spot at the top of the second hour. It's still a great spot. Ouch. Um... Is this Henry's call? Belinda, you know, she... She had faith in me from the very beginning. You mind if I be the one to tell her? Yeah, of course. You know... she's not the only one who had faith in you from the beginning. Pop. Heading to the crew party. Hey, could you help me with something real quick? Sure. I'm almost done with this manger and... -Oh, it looks great. -I can't get a grip on this guy. I need to make one last etching. -Okay. Here. -There you go. -Sure. Right here? -It's these calluses. -That'd be perfect. -Yeah. I can't get a grip. I don't guess you have that problem. I love you, Pop. I love you, too, son. In fact, I love you so much I'm gonna just say this as plainly as I can. My entire life I've just wanted to make you proud of me. I know this is not the line of work that you would have chosen for me, but... That's just it. You don't get to choose. It's not your choice. It's my choice. It's my life. And I just wish you could accept that. And if you can't... I can accept that, too. See you after the party. Wow. Gavin did a bang-up job, huh? I mean, I almost hate to admit it, but this looks great. Speaking of... Hey. Hey. This looks amazing. Thank you. Um, you look amazing. Thank you. Oh, I was gonna tell you. I, uh... -I finally talked to my dad. -Oh, wow. -Yeah. -How did that go? So he's not the best listener. You were right. At least it felt good to get it off my chest. You know, there is something I brought to show you, but I forgot it in the studio, so I'll be right back. I'll be here. Belinda? I didn't know anybody was here. I'm just... clearing my head for tomorrow. Oh, yeah, no. It's okay. Look, I just want to apologize. Apologize? Yeah. You know, for... having to replace you with Alexis for the opener. I... I know you would have been incredible. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Hey. -Having fun? -Yeah. Oh, have you seen Belinda? Yeah, she's back in the studio. Oh, good. She must not have taken the news very well, did she? What news? Well, you know, about the opener change. I tried to apologize, but... Vivienne, I haven't... I haven't told her. I didn't know that you didn't tell her. I didn't know that you didn't tell her yet. Oh, Vivienne. I gotta go talk to her. No, Gavin, I'm so sorry... Vivienne, this is not just a client. This is a dear friend, so... I...I gotta go talk to her. I'm sorry. -Vivienne. -Huh> We have to find her Yeah, no, don't worry. Gavin's looking for Belinda, so... Belinda? Belinda's missing, too? What do you mean, "missing too"? No one's seen Alexis since last night. The hotel said she's not in her room. -What? -Whoa. Did I just hear what I thought I heard? 'Cause surely the star of our Christmas special wouldn't be missing -12 hours before we tape. -No. I promise you we have everything under control. I certainly hope so, Vivienne. Mm-hm. Okay, think, think, think, think, think, think, think. Okay, um... I'll go to the airport. Maybe because of the snow she's stuck there. What will you do if you find her? I will strap her to the top of the van like a Christmas tree. I'm kidding. Mostly. Money for the poor. Sorry. I'm in a huge hurry. I'll come back later, though. Shoot. Um, okay. Just real quick. Here we go... Thank you, sugar. No. No, no, no, no, no. Not now. Not now. Oh, now you're starting to hurt my feelings. No, look. My starlets are missing, I'm about to get fired from my dream job before I've even been hired, and I've upset someone who means so much to me. I do not have time for this right now. I'm sorry, sugar, but the past stays put. The present is always changing. It's now or never. Well, great. I choose never. Whoa. You looking for these? Hey. Catch. Why do I keep falling for this? Don't beat yourself up. I've had a lot of practice. Okay, I put work ahead of everything. Mm-hm. I push away the people who matter most, and I'm a lousy person. I get it, so just... take me back, okay? That's big of you, sugar. But the past is only part of your story. Come on. So, what so you guys want for Christmas this year? Hmm. Besides a pony? Besides that. Wouldn't mind Vivienne laying off a little. Oh. Just because she has no life outside of work -doesn't mean we don't. -Tell me about it. Like... Georgia, I...I'm sorry. It's okay. Vivienne can be a little intense. "Intense". A little? Like who doesn't hire their own sister for a job? Like, I get strictly business, but... It's true. Vivienne's always worked too much. Always been stubborn, always needed things her way. But it wasn't easy after Mom left. Every Christmas I had presents under the tree. Vivienne gave up her childhood so that I could have one. I don't want to work for her just to stay close to you. Though that's an added benefit. I want to work for her... because she's my hero. Well, she doesn't make you sound too lousy. Smile! Oh. It's quite a haul this year. Well, Santa's elves are always working. Please extend our thanks to Vivienne. What do you mean? These gifts come courtesy of Marilyn Jinway. My mistake. Merry Christmas, Luanne. Merry Christmas. You make sure these kids have gifts every year. You have so much love in your heart, you have no choice but to spread it around. Every child deserves a good Christmas. You did, too. You know what it's like to go without. That's why you hold on so hard to what you have. The lesson you needed to learn isn't that you're a lousy person. We wouldn't have gone to all this trouble. The lesson you needed to learn is much harder than that. You needed to see just how wonderful you are. Hmm. On the first day of Christmas My true love sent to me A partridge in a pear tree On the second day of Christmas You said you wanted to find Alexis. Well... there she is. Two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree On the third day of Christmas Who are you hiding from? Belinda. I'm so sorry. I had nothing to do with... I know. Mulled cider. Good for the voice. How'd you find me? Honestly, I wasn't looking for you. But when I'm feeling lost, I just try to find somewhere to sing. I guess we're alike in that way, huh? -What if I blow it tomorrow? -You won't. -Come up with me. -No, I couldn't. Oh, come on. You already took my job. Don't turn me down for a duet, too. Oh, okay. Mind if we cut in? You're... -Spin us up a classic. -Yeah, sure. It's the most wonderful time of the year With the kids jingle belling And everyone telling you be of good cheer It's the most wonderful time of the year It's the hap-happiest season of all With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings When friends come to call It's the hap-happiest season of all Those two have a whole lot of joy to share. And I know you'll help them do it. Just remember, you don't have to do it on your own. One more? For old times' sake. Of Christmases long, long ago Catch. Of Christmases long, long ago Stories of Christmases long, long ago I... didn't go anywhere. But you did. Back a few minutes. On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me Two turtle doves Wait, why? I thought it'd help you out. You had a long week. How did you do it? Hmm? How did you manage so long without everything falling off the rails? I was stuck in my ways. It's easy to keep a train on the tracks when it doesn't move. But it doesn't go very far. I just wanted to be as good as you. You're not as good as me. You're better. Okay. So where's the last spirit? There's gotta be a Spirit of Christmas Future, right? There is no Spirit of Christmas Future. What? Our future is whatever we make it. A song yet to be written. The only question left is: What song will you sing? Thank you. And hearts will be glowing when loved ones are near Hey. Got your text. It's the most wonderful time It's the most wonderful time -They sound great together. -They do. It's the most wonderful time of the year -Right as usual. -Mm-hmm. -Great as always. -Thank you. I'm getting you back on that opener. I'm gonna talk to Henry. I'm gonna set it right. Gavin, it's okay. My career is in a new stage. Not worse, just different. You've been trying so hard to help me. I know, I just don't... I don't want you to feel like I've ever let you down. You could never let me down. Your talents are being wasted by having me as your only client. There are other artists... who deserve a manager like you, who cares as much as you do. Thank you. Hey, guys? I think I have an idea to make all of our dreams come true. I wrote a letter to Santa last night I told him what I want to make my Christmas right But if I don't get it I'm gonna be blue I want a rockin' little Christmas with you I want a rockin' little Christmas Rockin' little Christmas with you Oh, if I get my wishes it's gonna be delicious A stocking full of love for two I don't want no Tinker Toys Don't want to waste my time with any other boys There's only one thing that I want to do I want a rockin' little Christmas with you I want a rockin' little Christmas Rockin' little Christmas Rockin' little Christmas with you Cut. -Okay, that was perfect. -Great job. Parker, let's move on. Let's set for The Most Wonderful Time of the Year. It's the most wonderful time of the year They sound great together. They sure do. -Hey, Georgia? -Yeah? If it's truly what you want, I'd be honored if you'd continue working with me. Really? I love you so much. I love you, too. I can't see. It's the hap-happiest season of all This is quite the production. Yeah. Hey, what are you guys doing here? Viv invited us. Sit down, sit down, sit down. Thanks for coming. -Hey, how are you? -Hey. Ago Her voice... Stunning, isn't it? I'm proud of you, Gavin. I'm proud of you. Thank you. Thank you. Sure. Enjoy the show. It's the most wonderful time of the year There'll be parties for hosting Say, you wouldn't know anything about a missing billboard, would you? Well, you know, some things are just more important than money. -Hmm. -Mm-hmm. How did you get Henry to agree to a duet? Well, that was easy. He heard them sing. It's the most wonderful time of the year What? Oh, it's just the last four days you've been... What, a different person? No. The person I've always remembered. It's the most wonderful time It's the most wonderful time It's the most wonderful time of the year And cut! That's it. That is a wrap on Country Christmas Live! We were good. Woo-hoo! Yes, yes, yes. Oh. Oh, I couldn't have done any of this without you. Thank you, seriously. Whoo! What a show! Henry. I can't wait to see what you do with the IMAs. Um... About that. The IMAs are an amazing opportunity, and I thank you so much for that, but... this... this is my home. I can't move to L.A. Hmm. Well, I guess you're gonna rack up a lot of frequent flyer miles. You're serious? Normally, I would never let someone commute from Nashville to produce the IMAs. Something tells me you could pull it off. I can. I'm sure you can. Merry Christmas, you two. -Merry Christmas, Henry. -Merry Christmas. I have to say, I agree with him. Um... There's been something I've been meaning to show you. My name's Gavin Chase, and I'm ten years old. My best friend's name is Vivienne, and... I hope we're best friends forever. You told me the tape was full. There might have been a little bit more space there. Just a little bit? I'm done... putting work before the people I care about. And I'm done needing to have everything my own way. I'm willing to compromise. Really? But. But-but-but... there's one thing I won't compromise on. What's that? It's how I feel about you. You know, everything that kid said on that tape is true. So if we're gonna be best friends forever, then... I guess I just fell in love with my best friend. Hey, actually, uh... can you leave that? Thanks. Oh. -How convenient. -Very convenient.
