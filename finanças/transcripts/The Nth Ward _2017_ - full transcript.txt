Wind speeds topping 140 miles an hour, this storm is cutting a path of destruction along the gulf coast. itâ€™s been pouring rain for hours, with almost zero visibility. Collapsed structures have trapped people and widespread flooding has isolated residential areas. Frantic calls to 911 have overcome the emergency system. Anyone who chose to remain in the city or somehow did not get the evacuation order, they must rescue themselves at this point or they will need to ride out the storm until rescuers can get to them once again. As for now, as you can see the conditions are just too treacherous. You be careful. How long will you be gone? Madison. Did I wake you? No. You didn't. Same dream? No. Do you need me to come over there? No. But will you talk to me until I fall asleep? Of course, what do you want to hear this time? When mom and dad met at the wine party. Well, your dad and I were having a small get-together at our apartment. Your mom was a friend of a friend. And you didn't know her, right? That's right. Neither one of us had ever met her. She wasn't supposed to come to the party, but at the last minute she decided to come because all her plans fell through in Napa. We didn't have Syrah that night. The Beaujoulais Nouveau just came in. Packed up your desk with the files you requested. Oh, thanks. Is that still your hobby, maps? Didn't your parents do something like that? Storm chasers. Something like that. What about that map? Did they figure anything out? No, not before they... I'm sorry. It's okay. So, New Orleans? Yeah. Have you been? Never. I love Nawlins. Nawlins? Is that how they say it? Hey. Oh, sure you don't need a ride to the airport. Not flying. You're kidding? Doc insists on escorting me. And he doesn't fly. Have him take you on one of those ghost tours while he's there. I'm not into that voodoo stuff. Maybe Doc will be. You know, put a curse on people. Talk to the dead. Chicken feet dangling from the ceiling. You're terrible. Maybe it'll loosen him up. I doubt it. What's so funny? Nothing. Anymore boxes? No, that's the last one. What is this? Some of mom and dad's old stuff. Relics. Yeah. So where does it go? Actually you know, I'll take that with me. Hey, call me when you get in. Bye sweetie. Take care. Have a safe trip, Doc. I don't like it when she calls me that. It's disrespectful. Why? I call you that. Yeah, that's different. I've always like to pretend it mean uncle coming from you. Yeah, but we're not related. I'm your guardian. I'm not 14 anymore, I'm an adult. But I'll always look after you. I know, as soon as I get things going down there, I'll be back. Ready? Hey, Tricia. What the hell are you doing here, Roger? I'm here to pick up Katie. Well, she's not here. What do you mean, "she's not here"? She left with her daddy. I'm her daddy. Did he take her to school again? This is the third time. I just drove two hours. I woke up at 4 o'clock this morning so I'd be here on time. This was scheduled. Have you been drinking. No. I haven't. Come back tomorrow. You know it ain't that easy. You purposely moved two hours away. Well, you could have moved too. My work's in New Orleans. Oh, that's right, you build mobile homes. It's modular construction, not mobile homes. It's the same thing and you can do that here. It's where the work is. Well, you chose and you made your decision. Tricia... Actually, don't come back here again. I want to see my daughter. Take me to court. Daddy! How's my little girl? Good. When am I coming to your house? Soon, sweetheart. Soon. Do I have a room? You sure do, it's real pretty just like you. I miss you. I miss you too. I know it's been years, but we have to make sure the ward can sustain development. People are out of their homes for a reason. But for how long, Mayor? As long as it take to restore order. It's dangerous right now. Squatters, looters, unsafe structures. Mayor Bennett, what about the disappearances? The disappearances are under investigation. This is the fifth disappearance month. As mayor of our beloved New Orleans, I'll get to the bottom of this. One step at a time though. That's all for now. Mayor! Mayor! We need answers. Where are you going? You seriously have never flown on a plane? Never. Why? Birds fly, not humans. That's ridiculous, Doc. Why fly when it's so nice to drive? Because it takes like five times as long to get anywhere. Well, it gives me five times as much time to spend with you. Was this the way? They took road trips all over the country. This was the road? I mean, this is where their notes stop on the map. Yes, um, they were coming back up from the south. And, uh, they took this road. Hmm. What's that? Research on tremors in the bay area. Not your thing, huh? What's up there? I don't know. You didn't ask? Well, I didn't get the grand tour. How did you find out about this place? Online. It's kind of a dump. It's okay, it's close to work. If you need money... Oh, I'm good, Doc. When do you start work? I don't know, I meet with the director tomorrow and he's going to tell me where I go. I presume it's the ward that's never been rebuilt. Hmm. Hey, Lew. I assume you are the owner of this lovely place. Hello. Uh, this is my uncle, Dr. Leland Garr. Doctor? What kind of doctor? I've been having terrible sleeping problems. I'm not that kind of a doctor. What kind of doctor are you? Doctor of religion, sorry. Kind of confusing that doctor title. What's up there? Attic. What's in the attic? All kinds of stuff. I keep it locked. Nobody's been up there in years. Is that right? Doc. It's time for America's Funniest Home Videos. I love that show. Nice to meet you, Doctor "not that kind" Garr. Madison, I'll be seeing you around. Alright. Bye, Lew. I told you, there's nothing to worry about. What are you, kidding? He's obviously a lunatic. Who still watches that show? This is the stuff form your folks' attic. Yeah. Childhood stuff. "Most likely." "Most likely" to fall in on you. It's a dump. I'll be back, okay? You sure you're going to be alright, baby girl. Yeah, sure. You'll be working with the contractor who won the bid. Everyone in the ward needs to be vacated. Some of the houses have been marked for demolition. But not all. Why has it taken so long? Things don't happen over night. Maybe that's been your experience in the past. No, it hasn't. But there is a possibility of rebuilding? A storm came. Levee broke, washed everything and everyone out. And if it's not, you can just note that and be on your way. There are a few people still living in the ward in damaged homes. And squatters. Did I say that already? We can't do anything until they're gone. Everyone's given up on that ward. Evaluate the soil and water. And let me know if she can be rebuilt. Eugenia! Could you check to see where that contractor is? Yes. And get the files for Madison. Right way, Mr. O'Reilly. That'll be all. Thank you. That's all? I'm afraid so. After all these years? That's all I have to give you. But the contractor is waiting downstairs. Okay, thanks. So you won the bid? Been trying for months now. Competing with all kinds of contractors. Just trying to get things back on track. That's great they have a program that allows independent contractors to get guaranteed work. And guaranteed payment. Aw, crap. I can fix that. You're a jeweler too? I am a man of many trades. No, it's okay. It's a nice necklace. Thanks. My parents gave it to me. Cool. Your parents gave you jewelry, mine kicked me out. You close to your parents? They're gone. I'm sorry. Kitch? That's a nice name. Yeah, friends gave it to me. When my wife left, she took everything by the kitchen sink and me. My real name is Roger. So, why'd you stop? We'll have to walk from here. Mud is getting kinda deep. Gosh, I didn't know it was this bad here. This is our dumping ground. Seriously? Yeah, instead of driving down to the city dump, contractors have been sweeping trailers full of debris down here. All kinds of stuff, you name it. We need to get movin', I don't wanna be here after dark. Okay. Where is this water coming from? Beside from the rain, ward don't even have running water. What's that? It's a water and soil test kit. I need to take some samples. See what stuff was left over from the flood water. Sometimes all kinds of things get dredged up leaving the foundation unstable. The water may be contaminated with sewage or animal waste. Chemicals from the rain, roads, farms, storage buildings, sediment and other stuff. If the surrounding ground is saturated it may create uneven pressure on the system's foundation resulting in cracking or even collapsing. You know your stuff. Sorry. You probably know this already. Not as much as you. So what are those markings over there? When a house is cleared for demolition, it's marked with that x there. Contractor shorthand. And why are those markings there different. Not familiar with those. Somebody else's shorthand, not sure what those mean. Why don't we start at the end of the block and work our way up. Okay. Uh. These overhangs aren't supported. Stay here. I'm going make sure it's safe for you to enter. I can determine that. I'll just make sure no one's inside. Is anyone in there? Can I come in? How does it look? Shit! What is it? Snake. Didn't I tell you to wait outside? I'm not good with commands. Can you please wait outside? No. This room and water are nasty. Don't move. Why? I'm not afraid of snakes. Don't take another step! That whole area is wood rot. It'll cave right in if you walk on it. Don't move. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Take your right food and move it back two inches. How did you know? Cuboidal cracking. Cubes start to form in the wood. That's one way to tell. That piece over there is all fibrous. On appearance it looks stable. But, put a little pressure on it, it's as soft as tissue. You'll fall right through. When walking into a damaged house, always look before you step. I don't think anyone's living here. Careful. That's strange. Yeah, because it's the only house standing, right? Yeah. Looks like she jumped right over this one. Not foot or tire tracks. Just ours. Yes. Can I help you? Hi ma'am. My name is Madison Richards and I'm with the US Army Corps. And this is our contractor Kitch Jones. We're here to assess the damage in the area to see if we can rebuild. No damage here. Ma'am, we just have to make sure. I know it's been some time, but I assure you that our office is determined to rebuild this area to the way it was. To the way it was? Tea? No, thank you. But in the meantime, modular housing. I'll take a cup please. Thank you, ma'am. You're welcome. You do any renovations? No, I never needed to. Unbelievable. There's no structural damage at all. Well, I was one of the fortunate ones. The only one. You know, someone from your office comes here at least once a year. Surveyors, like you. Or more voyeurs. They ask the same questions and I give them the same answers. You never see or hear from them again. Then you come, like it's all brand new. Meanwhile we've been here all this time. They want us to leave this ward, but I won't. I won't go. I thought you said you lived alone? Yes. Why? I thought I just saw someone. Sorry, I was looking at my phone. There's no reception in here. No, ma'am, there is not. Have you heard from any of the other neighbors. No, they never returned. Your family from around here. No, Ms. Legaux, I'm from Northern California. Sophie. Sophie. Seemed like you'd have some roots here. So how have you managed to live here with no electricity and no running water? Well, I clean the well water. Well water? Yes. From the floodwater? Yes. I'm quite sufficient. All my needs are met here. I have a garden in the back with a few chickens. A sturdy gate. And a shotgun. Like a pioneer. Much like a pioneer. We've taken up enough of your time. Well, thank you very much. You're quite welcome. What makes you different from all the others who have come? Um... I'm going to get the job done. No doubt, you're different. You'll come back to let me know, won't you, if that changes? Yes, of course. Alright, Ms. Legaux. Hello? Is anyone in there? I'll check around here. I don't think anybody lives here. You know, it has those same markings, and not the contractor ones. Madison? I see...I see something. Kitch! He went out the window. He has my bag! Kitch! Kitch! Kitch! Kitch! Kitch! Hey, hey, it's okay. It's me. You okay? Did you see who it was? No. Was that guy blue? I'm not sure. He looked blue. Okay, sometimes twilight can play tricks with your eyes. Anyway, he's gone. My bag. Here, he dropped it. Is everything in there? Samples are still here. My necklace is gone. What, you sure? It's not here. Shit! Iâ€™m sorry. Itâ€™s okay. Come on. He lives here. Don't matter, we can mark this house for teardown. He shouldn't be here anyway. Let's keep it moving. It's getting dark. I want to get out of here. Okay. What is it? It's a picture of me and my parents. There's some homeless guy with a digital camera. It's not going to exactly make the 10 o'clock news. But it was a picture of my and my parents. I don't know, it's not so grave that you can't do your job. I mean, you do want the job, right? I've got 30 guys lined up for this job. I don't need you seeing blue men. How long have been trying for this job, Kitch? I know what I saw. Right, Kitch? I don't know what I saw. Yeah, that's what I thought. Look, he probably heard you were coming. The press is going crazy with the possibility of rebuilding and with this open contractor program. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a meeting with the mayor. You must be Madison Richards and Kitch Jones. Mayor. Looking forward to seeing what you come up with. We're working on it. Everything okay? Yeah. Everything's fine. Ready for that meeting? Yeah. Alright, let's go. What was that? Nothing. There was a picture of Madison Richards in one of the houses. There isn't anything I should know about, is there? Richards? I don't know. I'm going to check the files to see if anyone else has experienced anything like this. The picture or the blue guy? Both. And I know what I saw, it wasn't twilight. And something tells me that those symbols were not contractor shorthand. Lew? You're back. I didn't mean to scare you. Want to join me for cookies? No thanks. The -- The what? Nothing. Good night. Oh! Is everything okay? There's...there's somebody in the walls. Well, animals crawl from the trees into the attic. But I keep that locked. No, no, the attic was open. Itâ€™s locked. See. I'll get the key and we can go take a look. You're not afraid of the dark, are you? This house... It's not haunted if that's what you think. I know you can go on those ghost tours. I can assure you, generations have lived here and died old and happily surrounded by their loved ones. No disgruntled deceased here. How can you be sure? That's it's not haunted? Iâ€™ve been here a long time. But it's a little too big for me. I like the company. Yeah, I know what it's like living in a big house. It can be isolating. Especially at night. But I like the company as well. See, nothing. Are you satisfied? I'm the only one with a key. Let's have cookies. Another cookie? Last one. Thanks. So tell me about the ninth ward. It's not safe. Yeah, water damage, infrastructure support. Itâ€™s never been safe. The rich live behind big gates and the middle class have left. All you're left with is the poor. And crime. And whatever else. Nothing like New Orleans, there's no place I'd rather be. It's a vibe, it's a feeling. I'm going to go to bed now. Hey Cindy, it's me. Can I text you a picture for doc? Yeah, he still doesn't have email or cell phone. Alright, thank you. Hey, Kitch. Yeah, I'd love to join you for a drink. Sounds great. Sure. Yeah, I'll see you there. Alright. Bye. Hey, Lew, I thought you went to bed. Can't sleep. Why are you sitting in the dark? I keep the lights off this time of year. We have breaking news another person has gone missing without a trace. This marks the sixth in a string of disappearances over the last several months. Can't sleep either? Think I'm still on west coast time. Want to join me for some television? We can catch the Late Late Show. No, thanks, I gotta go meet a friend. Actually a co-worker. I see. You be careful. Yeah. Thanks. Crazy day today. Yeah. Yeah, can I get you a drink? Oh, great yeah. Uh. Whiskey sour would be great. Whiskey sour and a diet coke, Allen. Diet coke? You're going to make me drink alone? I've done my share. Six months sober. So why are we meeting at a bar? Uh, best crawfish and dirty rice in town, believe it or not. And darts. You play? Do you play? Is that a challenge? I like a challenge. I wasn't challenging you. You backing down now? I never back down. Okay. Ladies first. Thank you, sir. You ready? Have at it. Good shot. How long did you have a problem? Long enough to lose my daughter. Sorry. Yeah, me too. Me and her mother were never good together, but I could have been better. What's your daughter's name? It's Katie. Katherine Marie. But she likes going by Katie. Katie, that's a pretty name. Thank you. So do you get to see her? Trying. Finish this job and a few months of sobriety hopefully I'll get a chance to get her back. You're on the right track. Yeah, well I hope so. It's been a long road. You find anything in those files? Not much. There was a symbol though. Yeah? What did it look like? Similar to the demo symbols, but I don't know, slightly different. I've never seen it before. Voodoo? I'm not sure. I can't find anything remotely like it. So I sent it to my uncle to check it out. The library's got old books. We can check there too. Great, and I'll check the files at the office. You really suck at darts. I never said I was good. I said I like a challenge. Just keep practicing. TouchÃ©. Thank you. How are we going to do this? Excuse me? I didn't mean that. I meant, how are we going to actually get work done in the ward after today? What is it? It's my predecessor. Missing persons? Do you know him? No, I tried calling him. Do you think he went missing on the job? Here? Iâ€™m not sure. I'm going to see if I can get in contact with my other predecessors. I have to go. No problem. Go. Getting closer to what the significance of the ward is. Levees will not be able to sustain next storm. They must be warned. Talk to the residents. Not safe here. Hmm. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Ouch! They're attracted to light. Termites are attracted to light. It's okay. It's okay, it happens. But not like that. You stay here, Madison. What's going on? Why now? We have to warn them. What if something happens? Just keep her safe. We made a deal. That's all we can tell, okay. We will be in contact with you. How long will you be gone. You be good and you listen to Doc. I love you. You keep this. Hold it for me. Until I get back. Thank you. Hey, I'm wake. You don't have to be quiet on my account. How did you sleep? It was one of my better nights. Good. You hungry? Oh, yeah. There we go. Alright. Wow. Coffee? Yes, please. Thanks. You bet. These are really good. And I don't like eggs. I'm sorry. Katie doesn't like them either. But she'll eat them like this. No really, they're good. How do you get Katie to like them. Secret? Lots of cheese. Yeah, secret. Well, it ain't really a secret. It's... Madison? They were hiding a secret. Who? What secret? My parents. We need to find the secret they found. If we can figure out the secret, we can figure out why the people have been disappearing. Okay, how? Well, I have a list of the former residents whose homes were destroyed. And who would have lived here when my parents went missing 15 years ago. I have their forwarding addresses. And a few live nearby. You're her first visitor. I hate to say it, but she's not really coherent. She doesn't recognize anyone or remember anything. I'm not sure she's going to be of any help, but here she is. Thank you. Hello. Ms. Dottie? My name is Madison. I'm an engineer with the US Army Corps. They took my house away from me. Yes. The hurricane. They took it. They took them all away from us. All? You be careful, they're watching. Take me outside for some air. And grab that umbrella over there. Come on, let's go. The heat is too harsh on my skin. I didn't want to talk to you in there. I know, you think I'm crazy too. But do you know what's crazier, me staying in that ward So you want to be here? I can stay here, I'm fed three times a day, a warm bed to sleep in, and no one hunting me. I'm off the map here. Off the map? Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry I thought you could help me. You've lived in that ward for over 20 years. And I just thought -- you know, my parents were -- They didn't want us in that ward. If you didn't leave on your own, you were left on you own. So you think you were forced to leave? Why else hasn't that ward been rebuilt? They didn't want us there from the get go. So someone... Something, forced us out. Could be an act of God. Or just an act. They offered us money to leave the ward. Some who didn't take the money, our homes were destroyed. And when that didn't keep us out, some disappeared. Those spared owe their lives. Who do you owe your life to? Do these people look familiar to you? They were warned. What do you mean, "they were warned"? The watchers. I hope I haven't said too much. They know you. Watchers? Who are watching? Oh, you don't want to go too deep down that rabbit hole. You might not like what you find. The power these people have. Power, I mean, who has has that much power? Do you believe -- Belief? Doesn't matter if I believe it or not, if it's true. Listen, I read that you have a son that he lives with you. Do you think that I might be able to talk with him? Does he know what you're talking about. They got him too. I'm going go ahead and go right now. My dinner's getting cold. You go see the man at the house. You'll know it when you see it. And, uh, you can go ahead and keep that umbrella. Because it's going to rain. The sediment in your samples didn't come from the flood water. But where did it come from? That's actually fresh water bacteria. Not found in salt water. People are dumping tires, mattresses and trash. I mean, who would bring in fresh water? I also found that the soil in one of your samples contained a high concentration of silver nitrate. Who's putting silver in the soil? It could have been dredged up from the broken levee. A lot of stuff settled in the soil once they drained the water. The water from levee brought in an infestation of mosquitoes with the West Nile virus. Among other diseases that settled in the soil with the stagnate water. But if a garden has a high level of silver nitrate... It would be contaminated. And anything that was ingested you would see it on their skin. Blue skin. Argyria. The reaction of ingesting silver, it turns the skin blue. City plans from the 1900s. Power grid. Library closes in five minutes. Okay. Thank you, ma'am. Property deeds? That doesn't make sense. Hey Madison. You find anything? Yeah, but I'm not sure what it means. The Legaux house isn't on any grid. No water or power running to or from the house. But she had electricity. Did she have a generator? I didn't see or hear one. Any luck on your end. Yeah, bits and pieces, but not a clear picture. I'll meet you back at your place. I have to make a stop first. Okay. I'll see you then. That wasn't five minutes. Hey. Hey, I'm still here. Ma'am? Hello! Hello? Anybody! Hello! Hello?! Hello! Hello?! Hello?! Merci. Can I help you? Yes, maybe you can. We got candles, incense, crystals. What is this? I don't know. You tell me. It's a triangle with a circle inside. Is it voodoo? You think all black people practice voodoo? Get out of here. I'm sorry. Where did you see it? In the 9th Ward on the houses marked for teardown. How many of them were there? I think there were about seven. Do you have any idea what it means? The three sides of the triangle might possibly mean trinity. Like in Christianity? Yeah. But trinity may means different things for different people. Like mother, father, child. Creation, preservation, destruction. And it is not a circle in the triangle. It is an eye. It means cleansing. A sign of protection. You see those two elements? There's a female element and a male element. And together they are very powerful. Protection from what? That's not the symbol I'd be worried about. If I were you, I'd worry about this mark on the house. But that's contractor shorthand. It looks like the symbol from voodoo queen of New Orleans. What does it mean? The story is that Marie Laveau, voodoo queen, will grant you help if you mark it with an x. But you must mark it on a tombstone. I don't want any of that stuff in here. No black magic here. Leave. Grant protection from what? There's voodoo in that ward. What is all this? Voodoo shit? I don't know, it's something. Something that people are disappearing because of. And it's real. Why are we doing this then? This is crazy. Don't you want to know what's going on? No. I just want to do the job, get paid and keep it going. If we don't find out what's going on, we're not going to get anywhere with this project. I mean, I think there is more information in the files at the corps office. The hell with the files. You're doing this for more than the project. I have to find out what happened to my parents. If there is any connection -- To whose end? Your own? I thought you were with me in this. Shit, I was. But it ain't worth getting killed over. Missing parents or not. It does you no good when you end up like them. Don't go. I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. Don't work too late. No one notices and they don't appreciate it. Have a good night. Goodnight. Hey, Eugenia is there any reason why my access would be restricted. Umm, no. No, I don't know. But O'Reilly is still here maybe you can catch him. Okay, thanks. O'Reilly. What do you want? I was trying to access some information and I couldn't get in. What are you looking for? Some information about the 9th Ward. Is that a problem? No problem. Some people start asking too many questions bad things happen. I'm sorry, is that a threat? It's an observation. Don't let the residents manipulate you. You're here for one reason. If you don't think it's rebuildable then deem it, stamp it, and go back home. Or stay. Lew? No, it's me. Madison, I know you're upset with me. What are you doing here? I know you think I let you down, but I didn't. I know you were just trying to make sense of your parents' work. Sorry. Kitch! So connecting the coordinates creates one big triangle. Over the 9th Ward. A ward within a ward. Sophie Legaux's house in the center of it. Yes, my parents' work. Maybe they knew the levees had been undermined. Set up to be destroyed. Beyond the lack of maintenance. The city knew the levee needed reinforcement? Worse, no one did anything. That's some pretty serious shit you're suspecting. Someone intentionally destroyed the ward? Well, maybe someone knew there was a pattern and they intentionally manipulated that pattern for their own purposes. Don't have to rebuild the levee, know a storm is going to hit, cause catastrophic repercussions. Forcing people to leave their homes. That's where the property deed comes in. Yeah, and that's what my parents' research showed. They knew something was happening in this ward. It still doesn't explain the disappearance or the other that have gone missing since. Yeah. It's a place to start. If that's true, we need to report this. To whom? To the police. Or someone who will listen. This is beyond us. Beyond, beyond the scope of what I do. Listen, let's just meet at the office tomorrow and go through more of the files, we need more information. Okay. Alright. You sure you're going to be okay here? Yeah, I'll just, uh, turn the light down dim. Well, call me if you need anything. Thanks. Yeah, I'm on my way, I just need to make a stop first. Sit tight. Take care of yourself. And what is that supposed to mean? Will I end up like others have? Ms. Sophie. Now you're not getting soft on me, are you? Anyway, no one was supposed to get hurt. And yet many have. Madison. What brings you here, Mayor? It's my city. I have to take care of it. Why don't you come by the office later and we can talk. And you can give me an update. See you later. He comes here now and then to check on us. I laugh. He doesn't give a damn really. Why does he come here? Well, he thinks I have some kind of influence, power. Do you? Marie Laveau? My name's Legaux. Do you think I'm the voodoo queen and I made the storm happen? I don't know what to think anymore. You seemed troubled, child. I shouldn't have come here. Why did you come? Thought I could get some answers. Change. That's what they mean. What? The symbols on the houses. What kind of change. Changing of the times. Nothing will be the same. Or it will be as it was. Okay. I don't know what to tell you. You know I need this. Yeah, I'm sorry. I did everything I can. Iâ€™m going to have to let you go. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do. There's nothing you can do? No. Yeah, well, thanks for nothing. Kitch. What's going on? I just lost my at getting my daughter back. I got pulled off. Someone else got the contract. They can't do that. Well, they just did. Madison, can I see you? Hey, you did this. Be careful. Kitch. Why did you fire Kitch? I want progress. As of now, I'm not getting it. Do you have an update? We were getting a better understanding. Can you rebuild or not? It's that simple. Well, I found some anomalies. Anomalies? Is that really your job? I figured you'd come here, tell me there isn't a way to rebuild and be on your way. If that's a problem, you need to tell Washington. You can tell them on your flight back home. You're not needed here anymore. Eugenia will see you out. I will see myself out. You've reached the voicemail of Kitch Jones. Kitch, please don't be mad. I promise I'll get your job back. Call me when you get this. So where we at? Looks like it won't happen. Foundation is too unstable. What about Madison? I thought she was the one. There's too much going on to rebuild at this time. We still got squatters. Those have been taken care of. And there are residents who are expecting to come back? Most have relocated and not even thinking about coming back any time soon. There's on person in particular we're waiting on. Well, what are we going to do with her? Persuade her a little harder to leave. And if she doesn't? Well, she's an older woman. It'd be a tragedy if something happened to her while she was all alone in that big house. Well, I can't condone that, can I? Sheâ€™ll be out and you donâ€™t have to know about it. Listen, we just want safety. Youâ€™ll get safety. Don't worry. Don't go. Don't go. Move! Out of the way. Kitch, please don't be mad. I promise I'll get your job back. Call me when you get this. Madison! Madison! Hey. She's not here. Dammit! But I think I'm on to something about what's going on in the ward. Oh yeah? What's that? That something more than a natural disaster happened. Someone is trying to manipulate the situation trying to convince people that the land is not rebuildable. Pumping bacteria, contaminating the soil. So you think something else is at play? And who do you think is responsible? O'Reilly? Well, that's a start, I mean. Why have my predecessors left or gone missing? What would he benefit? I'm not sure. But why would be pull Kitch and me off the project? And why hasn't this ward been rebuilt? If the land is deemed condemned and the owners can't rebuild then somebody would just buy that land dirt cheap. And make a fortune in development. There's a few reasons why the ward hadn't been rebuilt. See, things don't happen over night down here. It takes years sometimes. Patience. Funding. And residents not willing to leave. You know, I may have some information that may help you. Great. But I want to hear more of your theory. You think you could write something up for me? I believe you. I think you may be right. Thank you for looking into this. Let me walk you out. You know what, I may have that information that you need right around here somewhere. Give me a second, I'll get it for you. Um, actually, Kitch is waiting for me downstairs in his truck. So, thank you. You sure, it'll only take a minute? Oh yes, and I'll get that report in to you in the morning. And I'll be on my way back to San Francisco. We're renovating this side of the building. It was hit bad by the storm. A lot of water damage. Accidents happen in construction sites. Wood rot. Listen, I'm sorry it had to end like this. Why couldn't you just leave like all the rest of the engineers. You had to be the one with the solution. Mess up everything, everything I've been trying to do for years. What about the people in the ward? That ward is no longer for the poor. You know how much money I stand to make on that land? All you had to do was say it was unbuildable. Because the parcels of the land are still in the hand of the land owners. Come here! Help! Help!!! Help! Oh my god! Help! Help! Ohh! Help! She sent me to protect you. Thank you. You okay? Yeah. It's over. We got proof now. Madison! Madison! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Madison is not here. She's fine. She had to make a stop before she left. Who the hell are you? Kitch Jones. We work together. Just keeps getting weirder around here. Ms. Legaux. You came back. You get your answers? Yes. Your neighbors will be moving back. Isn't that what you wanted? I already got what I wanted. And the ward will be rebuilt. To the way it was? With improvements. By the way, the soil in your garden is contaminated. I know. So what happened? The mayor had no intentions of rebuilding for the current residents, but had aspirations to gentrify the ward. And how was he able to do that? Move everyone out. Or get rid of them. Yes, then he could do as he pleased. Come in, won't you. Yes. How is it that you have power? There's more than one kind of power in this world. Batteries. Ah, right. Tea? Sure. Do you think you'll like it here? Nawlins? I think it might take a little getting used to. But I think Doc is off to a good start. I don't believe you still watch this stuff. You think that's funny? Hahaha. Look. Kicked in the crouch. That would hurt, I don't think that's so funny. Any leads on your parents? No. But... Doc said he'll help me find them. I didn't know but he's been looking for them all along. Wow. Madison! Katie! Hey, sweetheart. What do you have there? A woman told me to give this to you.
