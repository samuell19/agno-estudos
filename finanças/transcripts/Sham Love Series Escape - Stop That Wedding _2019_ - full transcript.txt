Okay, all right, so you know Robert. So he keeps saying that we've broken up. You have broken up. The thing is I just don't know what else to say about it... He's gone off with someone else!

Okay, so I'm gonna drive you to the airport in my car. Are you driving? - Yes, I just said that. - Okay. And they were there , but we need to try and find it because I can't, it's all Robert's fault! He promised me he was gonna get married to me. Did you see the wedding dress? - I had my... - Stop!

We need to hurry up, stop! Why, why? It's the police officers! Where? Oh, my God, oh, my God! Go now! What is going on, seriously? Where are we? Right, when you get to the end of the road, I need you to take the next left. - Where's that? - The next left, okay? Please. What's down there? Why are we going left? I'm borrowing this, okay? This one? Yeah, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, stop! Diana, what are you doing? Get in! No, I know what to do. I need the mannequin and I need you to get my suitcases out the car. - But why? - Just do it, please! Please, T! Panicking, I'm panicking. Oh, my God, Diana! I need you to distract them. Do whatever you need to do to distract the police, please. Diana, okay, I will, I will, but please... Please, thank you. Thank you, I'll speak to you, I'll call you. The thing is, what I was saying, the thing is, it's Robert, 'cause I called you - just after I spoke to him... - Excuse me, officers! And then, the thing, no one can blame me for that... You know the woman I was with, I don't know why I kept running from you, but she's heading to the airport, she's going aboard... - Slow down. - She's going to Egy... What woman, what are you trying to tell us? My friend who I was with, she's running from you. She's been running from you all day, and she got the red hair! No, I think you're confused. I'm really sorry. Course he's not lost it, he's texting me on it. Losing my mind. Oh! Hi, Martha, it's me. Yeah, I'm good, I just thought I'd give you a security call, so you know I haven't slain myself. No, it doesn't matter. Yeah, so I'm meetin' with him Saturday after next. He's just gonna come around, and then at the, well, obviously before the wedding. Otherwise, it would be pointless. Well, what do you suggest I do then if not seduce him? I know. I know. I know. Well, I know that's a possibility, but I just don't wanna think about that right now. Bye. Robby, it's me, it's D. Can you call me back, please, when you get this message? Robby, can you call me back, please? I need you to call me, please. Martha? Martha, he's wedding her tomorrow. No, he just called me to tell me he's moved the wedding from my birthday on the 24th to tomorrow! No, I'm the one who asked him to have some respect and not have it on my birthday! Oh, this isn't how it's supposed to go, I just wanted some more time! Oh, Martha, why does this happen to me? Two years, we're great, then he ran off, and then four years without Amelia, and now, five years with Robert. We're losin' our baby. No one will use me like this again, Martha! No, I'm not scorned. No, I won't let him go, Martha, go away! Martha, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm taking this all out on you as if it's your fault, and as if you're responsible, which, obviously, you're not. I'm so sorry. You're the only friend I've got, the only shoulder I've had to cry on. Yeah, I'll be fine eventually, yeah. He sent me a text! He hasn't picked up his phone for three days! He's staying at Michael's. They don't pick up their landline either. They're all just sittin' there avoiding me. Yeah. He's just so cruel, and he's just an asshole! I spent a fortune on him, and I tried everything! I know. I know he's not. He even bought the wedding dress, can't believe it. He said he loved it. No, I won't let it go! All I can think of right now is to, is just to go to the wedding tomorrow and walk in and tell the priest and all the guests that he's been living here with me like I was his wife for the last five years, and now he's run off to be with some other woman! I'm not gonna ruin anything, I won't disturb anything. I'm just gonna go in and then say what I've gotta say, and then, oh, Martha, your husband married you, not another woman, and you ran off with that sad, pathetic, ugly, old man who left you after two months! What do you know? You're not a furious old hen. You're beautiful and you're strong! And you'll stop that wedding! Never! Ever! Hello, Robert? Hi. It's really noisy. There's like a continuous whining noise on the line. You're breaking up. Hello, Robert, can you... Hello? Oh, Robert. Yeah, that's so much better. I couldn't really hear anything just now. Yes. I'm fine, thank you, and you? Oh, I only got in 10 minutes ago. Did you call earlier? Oh, okay. No, no, I've not been crying. No, no, no. Church, I just got in from church, yeah. Last night? I just went to bed. I couldn't sleep, so I took a tablet. No, only one. I had a headache, but it's gone now. Actually, I feel okay this morning. Martha came over, we had lunch, we did some shopping, and I put all your letters in the yellow bag. I told you, I went to church with Martha. Good. She is a perfect friend, you know that? She's so strong, such a strong shoulder, she's so patient. Yeah, you always thought that. I don't know, maybe you're right. I wore my pink dress with the black collar, and my black hat. Yes, I've still got them on now. Who, me? Smoking, no. I maybe had, like, three. What about you, have you just come in? What have you been doing? Are you home? Yes, yeah, the letter bag, yeah. Hello? Hello? Robert, I can't hear you again. You've gone all weird, like you're underwater. Can you hear me? Robert, you're gonna cut off. I'll call you straight back, or call me straight back. Please, oh. Okay. Yeah, I can hear you again, yeah. The letter bag, yeah, all your letters are here, yours and some of mine. You can come and get them whenever you want. Why is it difficult to come get them? I understand. So? Listen, Robert, does that mean that our, our weekend together is off? You're getting married tomorrow then? We'll be over forever? Yeah. I'm still here. Can I just call you back in a minute? I just need a few minutes. Yeah. Okay, but just promise me you'll pick up when I call back. Okay, I'll speak to you in a minute. Hi, Robby. I'm fine, honestly. Listen, I just spoke to Martha. Yeah, she'd really love to come to the wedding. You know she was always so fond of you. Well, sometimes, I thought you were quite fond of her too, but that's just my own insecurities. Yeah, sure, no, I won't come. No, she'll come on her own, definitely. I'm sure if you invite her, she.. Who, what act? An act, me? Oh, you know me better than that. Why would you say such a thing? What, you're gonna send an invitation, what, now? The wedding's tomorrow, there's no time. Well, why don't you just give me the address, and then I will pass it on to her? Sure I will. No, I won't attend the wedding, she will come on her own. Honestly, she really wants to come. Okay. Aw, no! Hi, Robert. Oh, thank goodness, I thought I'd lost you. Second thoughts, what do you mean second thought? Anyway, you were gonna give me the address of the wedding venue, I've got a pen now. What do you mean second thoughts? She said so? What, that you shouldn't give me the address? Robert, this is for Martha. I won't attend, you haven't invited me. No, I know that you haven't exactly invited her either, but she really wants to come. Well, you'll have to ignore her worries. Yeah, just ignore Yolanda's worries. To be frank, she just needs... You're right, I'm sorry, please don't get angry, just finding this difficult. I understand, I know she's your wife-to-be, I know. I know you love her, but... You said that you loved me. No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm fine, honestly. Sorry, I'm just emotional. Please don't end the call, please, Robert! "I love her. "She's my wife-to-be and we're having a baby. "You and I are over." Martha! Martha, Martha, he's having a baby. Robert, with her, with that woman, he's having a baby with her! He just told me on the phone. He said, "We're having a baby." I'm calm! What do you mean you don't think she is? I need to make sure I've heard him right because maybe that's why he left me. He made me have that terrible abortion, and now I might not be able to have kids! Is that why he's chosen her? You're right. You're right, cool, cool, cool, cool head, calm, calm. Cool head. Okay, I'll let you know. Robert, call me, please. I've done it, I've done the third one. It's still positive, I'm sorry. No, I'm still holding your baby. I'm sorry to be the bearer of such bad fucking news! I never even asked to have a baby. Well, it happened! Hi, Martha. I think I'm going mad. You'll never believe what he's just said to me. He just told me that they're havin' a baby, yeah. When did I tell you that? I actually am going mad. Can you come over? Actually, no, don't. I'm sending him an email. He needs to be reminded of everything that's happened, 'cause I don't understand what he's doing. I don't understand, I don't get it either. I've written an email, can I send it to you? Can you read it and then rewrite it as you see fit, and then send it to him? Someone with a clearer head, and it'll come better from you because you've witnessed it and you're my friend, and you know our history. Thank you. Hold on. Okay, I've just sent it. Okay. All right, thank you, let me know. Pick up your phone. Pick up your phone now and hear my voice! You said that if I loved you, I shouldn't be selfish! You said our relationship wouldn't survive if I would be selfish! You made me have that fuckin' abortion! And now I might not be able to have kids, and I did it for you 'cause you said you weren't ready! And now, and now I might not even be able to have kids! Hello, Robert. Yeah, I'm here. Yeah, I can hear you. Yes, yeah, I got them. But you know what, I don't have to answer to you. Ho, ho, you want to talk now! What's there to talk about? Are you gettin' married tomorrow? Then there's nothing to talk about! Hi, Robert it's me. Yeah, I'm fine, I was thinking about what you said. You're right, you know, maybe we should talk. We've got so many friends in common, it'd be good. Let's leave it nicely. Yeah, come over. Yeah, I'll be here all day. I can't really hear you, you're breakin' up. I'll be here all day. Yeah. Robert, what was the point of fighting a storm? It must pass, because it's come. So I give in to my inevitable fate, and it will pass too. What will be left of my fate is up to the scavengers of what was hope, to feed on, because my hope did not become my fate. My fate gave me no chance to run, to escape, to survive, to achieve my hope, to win. In that long fight between my fate and my hope, my fate has won. I fought for your love, Robert, your affection, your attention. Hi, Dad. Good. No, Robert's not here. No, I don't think Robert's coming back. Is Mum there? Okay, while you're on the phone, listen, your gun, your hunting gun, do you think I could borrow it for a little trip I'm doing? Yeah. Yeah. Okay, I'll find another trip. Be strong, got it. Plenty more fish in the sea, got it. Huh? I've just got tot stop the fire alarm. I dared to believe in love of a woman for her man. I'll speak to you soon. What she thought was her man. Bye, bye. I dared to believe in something that I've never seen before, something I gave but never received without seeing or receiving. I gave you my love, Robert, but you sent me a storm in return. You smashed everything. When you read this, Robert, just know that I confronted my fate with bravery, that I went bravely with the storm you sent my way in return for the love I sent yours, Robert. There is nothing to live for. Hi, Robby. Oh, please, no. Sorry, no. No fire. The parents, of course, and the neighbors, yeah. No, I understand, thank you. No, it's just an accident. Yeah, yep, just going to bed, thank you. Thank you, goodnight. Hi, Dad. Yeah. No, I understand. I'm coping really well. I'll come by as soon as I get a chance, okay? Say that again. Bye. Don't be a victim, let others be a victim. Be the last one standing. Let others be the victim, always be the last one standing. You're the victim, not me. I'll spit on your body. Hi, Robert. Yeah. Good. Do you still want to come over and have that talk? Just, you know, come over now. What does Mike call it? Booty call. Oh, you heard him. Yeah. You know, I think you should probably come and get him. Yeah, come and get him, I actually don't want him. If not, I'll just take him down to Battersea. You forget that you met that woman when you took our dog to mate with her bitch. What, gloves, what? Fur-lined gloves, I don't know, I haven't seen them. I'll have a look. They're possibly here. No, I can't find them anywhere. I've had a look everywhere, I've had a look in the chest of drawers. I'm in the wardrobe and I can't find them. Okay, let me have another look. Found them. I'm gonna put 'em with the letters in a bag and you can get them when you come 'round. Yeah, you should keep them, they're in good condition. Yeah, the dog, oh, the dog's in great condition. The dog will be in the same condition as the gloves when you get here. All right, bye. No, this won't do! That's your lot, Robby! Hello? Electoral register, no, thank you! Hello, Robert. What? No, no, no, no, don't send Michael, you have to come yourself. I've been waiting for you. I've got everything ready for you. I've got your letters here. No, I haven't opened any of them. I promised you I wouldn't do that. No! What? I can't really hear what you're... Did you say reconciliation? Did you just say reconciliation? Between who and who? When? What? Robert, I can't really hear you, not now! Hello? Robert, Robert, I can't really hear you. You sound all weird again, like you're underwater. I can't really hear you, but we can sort everything out, please. Robert, how can you reconcile with someone when you can't hear each other? God's sake! Martha, Martha, call me back, please. Oh, God. Martha, he's talking about reconciliation. He is, I just spoke to him, Robert! I just had to tell you. I don't know what to do with myself. I feel so awful, I was planning to, what do you mean he's not? Don't be so pessimistic! No, the line got cut off 'cause the reception has been really, really bad. Oh, my God, it's him, it's him! Robert? No, no, no, please, please, don't apologize. You've got nothing to be sorry for, that's unfair on you. You've been nothing but a gentleman. You've been noble, really noble. You gave me every chance. It's just we had so many obstacles in the way of our relationship together, but those obstacles, we've ridden them out now! Where are you now, are you driving now? God, I'm talking to myself. Hi, Robert, it's only me, it's D. Yeah, how funny, I was just chatting away to myself, didn't even realize that the line had gone dead. Anyway, you must be driving now, so I'm gonna order us some food. I'm gonna order your seafood combo, I know it's your favorite, and it will be ready and warm for when you get here. Okay, bye, bye, bye. Go wash yourself, woman. How are you? Come in. Missed you. Hi, Robert, it's me. I'm just phoning to see where you are. I've been waiting for you, and I'm so excited to see you. Maybe give me a call back when you get this. Actually, no, do you know what? I'm gonna call you on the landline. Ignore me, I'm gonna call you on the landline now. Hello? Hi, Mike, is that you? Hallelujah, you pick up your phone! I've been calling for days, no one ever picks up the landline! Yeah, how are you? I'm great. Listen, I just wanna be quick, I'm waiting for Robert. I was just speaking to him on the phone just now, and then we got cut off. Oh. Oh, that's fine, he must have already left then. He must be driving on his way here now. We've been talking, so... Sorry, what do you mean he's not gonna be in London for a few day... Really? When did he travel? Course. Silly me, that's why the phone line's been so bad and why he got cut off. Where exactly is he? Okay. Bye. Stop. Just stop talking, Robert! Where are you? Where are you? In fact, you don't even need to tell me because I know! How were you gonna come here tonight? How can you come from Tunis to our home here in London tonight for our reconciliation, and to pick up your letters and your dog? How were you gonna do that? I'm not. What are you talking about? I'm not making anything up. What are you talking about? You just said a while ago that you would come here tonight for the reconciliation and get your dog and your letters! I just don't understand, I don't understand. I'm not making anything up, I haven't, yes, your letters, you keep saying about your letters! Which one? What post, what post, when, what? Oh, the reconcil... reconciliation account statement for your mortgage. Is that the reconciliation you were talking about the whole time? No. Not reconciliation with me, no. I feel so stupid. I'm still here. So how is Tunis? Is she there with you now, hmm? Well, where is she then? I know she's from there, or her mother is. Yeah, I've been, haven't I? Martha's got relations there, do you remember? I've been there before. So is the wedding not tomorrow then if she's not, she flies in today. That's nice. And where, chapel airport. Lovely. Let me just get this straight in my head. You've been in Tunis this entire time, whilst arranging to come here and to keep me away. So when are you gonna come and get your reconciliation account statement, and your letters, and your dog? I can't post your dog. You know, I've gotta go now. Again. Who will be the last one standing? Hi, Michael. I'm sorry to keep bothering you. I just had a thought. Since Robert is marrying Yolanda, maybe you and I might like to have dinner some time? Aw, I know you always cared about me. I've always felt really close to you too, but you know, it was just awkward before. I wasn't free to, well, I am now. Since you're on the phone, you don't happen to know the name of the hotel where Robert's staying? And how do you spell? Great. Okay. Tomorrow, eight o'clock? The Zikora Bar, Chase Road? Perfect. Bye. Hello? Hello. I don't speak Arabic. I need to report a man staying in Hotel Zaza in Tunis. No, I'm English, English language. I need to report a man. His name is Robert Savage, and he's going to marry a woman called Yolanda. She's flying in tonight on a Tunisian air flight AJ98 at 10:15 p.m. Well, she is a drug courier. Yes, you need to arrest her. Hello? You need to arrest the woman and not let her in. I don't speak any Arabic. He doesn't know that she's carrying drugs, he's innocent. You need to send him back to London and arrest the woman. Put her in jail forever. Yes. Okay. Hi, Martha, it's me. I need you to call me as soon as you get this message. I think I've... Hello? Robert, Robert! Why? Why have they arrested you? An alibi, for what? Okay, okay. Yeah, okay, surety for bail, sure. No problem, how much? 250 grand? I don't really know what to do. Yeah. Character witness, yeah. Oh, Robert, what have I done? I'm so sorry! I'm sorry. I just, I'm... But it doesn't make sense! You've not done anything wrong, you have a... Cannabis? They found cannabis on you? Robert, what were you thinking? Why on earth would you have, you should have known! 12 years in prison for cannabis? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Okay, I'll speak to my parents and sort out the surety for the bail. They have holiday homes, one in Florida, one in Spain. You want me to fly out and be with you? What about Yolanda? Martha? British police. So she was arrested? So she's not on her way to Tunis? Are you sure? Wow. Okay, I'll get my parents to do the surety for the bail, and flight sorted now, and I'll be with you as soon as I can. Oh, so I can't call you on your mobile now? Right, okay, Central Tunis Police Station. Okay. Hello? Oh, oh, no, sorry, Officer, I hadn't finished. I was still speaking to Robert. Can you put him back? Hello, Martha? Hi. Yeah, I'm a bit panicky, I don't really know what I've done. I don't really know what to do. Where are you? What, where? As in the airport? Oh! Yeah, I didn't know that you were traveling. Where are you? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on a minute. You were arrested in Stansted Airport as you waited for your flight to Tunisia. Martha, what were you arrested for? A tip off? Possession of drugs? Martha, are you Yolanda? Martha? Are you Yolanda?
