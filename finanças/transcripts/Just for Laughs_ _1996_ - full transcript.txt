The court! Kiosaku. What is he thinking at that moment? We'll never know. When you wake up, the crowbar has already crossed the back of Marcel Dubois and cut through Nathalie Charpin's jugular vein. Is right which was a phenomenal blow, but it’s not in the jungle that are the reasons for this Herculean strength, as the accusation intends, but in tension and adrenaline! No! And yet, he spoke of savagery, but there was only one blow. Was Charpin aware of his strength? Look at him. Do not. Nathalie was the victim of an unfortunate set of circumstances. If lovers were in another position, where would the object have hit? Dr. we are not used to this type of "accident", it is a double murder, committed by a brute. Let us not be guided by emotion, we do not know where it can take us. Alice! Gaspard! Already? Good night! - Did you see me coming? - I was waiting. Smells good! Didn't you buy flowers? I forgot. It doesn't matter, I'll buy it. They will bring. That's why! I would like to know why people are always late in Paris. Because of traffic jams. This is not a reason, there are always traffic jams. A meeting is a certain place at a certain time, the rest does not matter. You go, I'm always uncomfortable when they offer me flowers. Michel is not coming with you? No, don't come. Never! It's really indecent. How long has this been going on? Six months. - And you didn't notice anything? - No. It seems impossible. Michel had a parallel life and you didn't notice anything? Well, I didn't notice it either, but I didn't live with him! He disguised it well, who would say! I would be unable to do this. - Do we know her? - No. I don't think so. I'm sure she is less beautiful than you. The men leave the woman for another one in an uglier one, I read in "Elle". - Eat more cake, there will be more. - Thanks... I did it, eat it. It's "Savoie" cake with cherries, it's lighter. And you Alice, don't you? Thanks. - What are you thinking about? - In nothing. - I was dreaming. - You were sleeping, you didn't drink coffee. I'm going to leave. Don't go now, it's only 11 am. Do you want me to take you? It's not worth it, there is still a metro at this hour. I don't want you to take the metro in that state. I'll get the car. Don't you want to sleep here? Do not. Promise me that you don't screw up. Do not worry. I'll call you tomorrow. Are you here? Yes, why? I don't know, I'm always afraid that you're not. Are you okay? Yes. - Do you love me? - Yes. - Tell me you love me. - I love you. Once again. - I love you. See you tomorrow? - Yes. A kiss. Sleep well my love. Goodnight My Love. Don't tickle me! Arnaud-Leroux office, good morning. Good morning Claire, it's Nicolas, is Alice here? No, it's in "Santé". I thought "Santé" was on Friday. It doesn't matter, send him a kiss. Sorry, do you know what time the lawyers leave? Today there are no lawyers, Wednesday is children's day. Yes it's true. Please, your documents? Nicolas? Juliette! What a surprise! - You don't work? - I took a few days. You did well. Take the opportunity to change your air and go to the beach. Alone is sad, I prefer to stroll in Paris. I am "rediscovering". Life is funny. We live in the most beautiful city in the world, we forget, and it takes a hard time to open our eyes. It is true. Since yesterday everything has been different. You will find it strange, but I envy you. Do not have. It's pretty sad. Life is not sad. Life is as it is. One day there is sun, one day there is rain, only sun, it would not be life. You see, you’ve lived in Paris for 20 years and you didn't see anything, everything was gray... Suddenly, everything lights up, and you see with your eyes from 20 years ago. Tourist eyes. Watch out. Do not let yourself go in your own unhappiness. I'm gonna cry. See! Please... I don't have time to console you. We have guests and haven't gone shopping yet. Go away, I'll cry alone. I don't care, crying relieves me. You shouldn't be there, it's not the ideal place to cry. Call me whenever you want, you can count on me, if I can console you... It's me. I tried to call you several times in the afternoon. Something urgent? The Teron come to dinner early in the evening, and I don't know if they'll bring the kids. Louise called me to cancel. The eldest has mumps. At his age it's kind of boring. The purchases are done. We will eat broccoli for three days. It doesn't matter, I love broccoli! For three days... we invited Juliette. Today I went to "Santé". Do what? To see you. Claire told me you were there. I know, but it wasn't true. Juliette asked me to go see her, I had to find an excuse. She's not doing well, she doesn't leave the house. I advised her to go to the beach, change the air. It's a good idea. She also thought so. What time is it? Six and a half. Only? I'm going to take a bath. Kan ji zai, bo za tsu, gyo... Kan ji zai, bo za tsu, gyo... jin han nya hara mita ji... Well, enough now! Arnaud-Leroux office, good morning. Good morning Claire, it's Nicolas, is Alice here? Yes one moment. Good morning darling. We had lunch together? Juliette comes to pick me up, I think it is better to be just the two of us. - Are you bored? - No, send him a kiss from me. - It's ok. See you later. See you later. Now we will see... During that time Raoul works overtime. And the more he works, the more Nathalie gets bored, depresses and turns to the good Dr. Dubois. Undoubtedly a good doctor, but not approved, and what a huge prescription. And what does he prescribe? Soothing, of course. No... The autopsy will reveal that it was a Chinese herbal aphrodisiac. Without a doubt its concept of parallel medicine. In any case, the two victims ingested this aphrodisiac... Who goes to the pharmacy to get these aphrodisiacs? Charpin! Who pays? Charpin! Who benefits? - It's me! - Good night. Did I forget a few years? No. It is without reason. A proof of love. - How sweet. - I need another half hour. - Then I'll take a shower. - Okay, see you soon. You didn't tell me yesterday that you saw Juliette. I completely forgot. Poor thing, you could have invited her. I invited her, but she was going to see Michel. I already knew. A couple like that, nothing can happen to him, some deviations, eventually, but nothing more... In fact, I was not surprised that she had had some adventures, Sometimes there are naughty little dogs. Please! I swear to you, I've seen you looking at me with very gluttonous eyes. Pretentious. Now that she's gone to see Michel, I'm no longer in danger. Everything ends well. I think he just came to get some things. Sometimes that's enough. Perhaps. Do you see cycling? This or something. - Are you sick? - No. - You are sure? - Have. Is it the Walloon Arrow, or the return to Flanders? Do not know. Good to know. Belgians are very susceptible, like Corsicans. Did you see? What? The TV guy, saying goodbye. And nice. It's tacky. Will you watch until the end? I think so. This will still take about two hours. I find it fascinating. I don't know how I should look at things, but it's quite disturbing. I don't see why. Finding out after 15 years that my wife likes cycling, it's disturbing. As if they told me... that you had a Dutch lover. A Van... anything... It has nothing to do! Of course there is. All cycling champions are Dutch. Everyone calls themselves Van something. Don't you have a lover? Don't be ridiculous. It is nothing extraordinary. No. But I have no lover. I'm glad. Excuse me. - Now do you read "Team"? - No... I'm just looking at the pictures. What are you doing here? I was looking for you, I'm not well. - Didn't you see Michel? - Saw. - Did you argue? - No, he was very nice. How silly! I can't hurt him, he's like that. He doesn't like me anymore, if I didn't like him, there was no problem. It's not his fault, if I still like him. It is true. He waited six months not to hurt me to no avail. Spending six months with someone you don't like is not easy. There it is true... - I arrived. - Do we have lunch together? We can have coffee. This week, I have lunch every day. - You are full of work! - It's true, things are going well. I saw you on television! - In winter there is no cycling? - No. - Do you do football? - No. I'm glad. What are you doing? - I work at B.H.V. - Seriously? Basketball, Handball, Volley. Don't be silly. Stay a little longer, I'll take you. And are you prudent? Five minutes. Shit! Hi Michel. - Hi how are you? - Good and you? As you see. I introduce you to Romance. - And your name? - IS. Juliette told me everything they have done for her, thank you very much, it makes things easier. She is already better. Is it your wife? It has nothing to do with it. Shit! How is she doing? Strange as it may seem it is better. Do you snore? Do not know. Because? Because I know that Juliette snores, that Nicolas doesn't snore, and I love you, and I know nothing. I never saw you sleep, I never woke up next to you. It's sad, isn't it? A bit. It is the first time I have been sad since we met. Will you take it? Next weekend I'm going to Italy, it's Milan-San Remo, I'll take you. You know it's not possible. I want to go on foot, come with me? It's me. So? It is not serious, it is depressed. What happened? She threw herself on the Seine, and there was a guy who saved her. Hopefully she doesn't get hepatitis, this one was missing! I'm going to take a bath. - Where was it? - At Ponte das Artes. I didn't know she was so romantic. It is good to know that if we throw ourselves into the water, someone will come for us. It's comforting. - Do you think you were? - Do not know. I think so. Hope so. I couldn't live with someone who didn't jump into the water in such a case. But it's also a lack of respect, if she wants to die, it's her choice, a choice that I respect, I don't see suicide as a cowardly act, it is an ideal of the absolute, I didn't think she was capable of such selflessness, rises in my regard. I will see you tomorrow. It is a four-quarters, with apple, it is less dry. You have to come and visit me when you're down. You do not express yourself. Speech, account. Friends are for that. Anyway, I decided to take care of you. We both go to the pool and come and do Zazen with me. At first it hurts your knees but then you will get used to it. Look who's coming! Have you arrived? There are no hours for the good. Such as? I brought you some cakes. Your brother called this morning, and I canceled it. You did well. How's it going? You have visits. It seems to be improving... Today you have to eat. See you soon. We do not know each other? It seems to me that I have seen her somewhere. No, certainly not. Do you know when she is discharged? Ask the doctor, she needs to see the psychologist. Maybe tomorrow. Do you want me to get the bed up? Don't you eat? It looks good, can I prove it? You do not want? Hello, how are you? Good Morning. So what was that? You gave us a scare. We are walking. Don't go, stay, I'm in a hurry. Don't be silly. I brought you chocolates. I will have regrets. I feel guilty. When are you leaving? Maybe tomorrow. Great, it's not that bad. Sorry, but I have to get going. Me too. I still get a little bit. See you later. What is your sign? Scorpion? Scorpion, heart, burning energy, born before day 3, faithfulness will not be the main virtue. The second dean, as ardent as the first, it will be favorable but not very talkative. Born after the 12th, their sensitivity will disperse in waves of sympathy, the recipients will be delighted. My advice: To win without desire is to triumph without joy. Nicolas, Alice has a lover! No! It's my wife. I'm in pain! It's me. Hello, are you very tired? A bit. - What do we have for dinner? - Pasta with ham. Well good. Put the music louder, please. Shit! It's a real "time trial", they make love in a hurry, running, timing just. Meetings are minute, conditioned by Charpin's schedule and Dubois' consultations. The policemen who were at the scene of the drama they heard two alarm clocks ring, one in the bedroom and one in the kitchen. Heard us At 6.25 pm, just 5 minutes before of Charpin's theoretical return. Both played with fire. A very strange joke... that didn't exclude Charpin, he also participated. Symbolically, the alarm clock was him. The second hand... He was always there, absent and omnipresent. But what is your role? It is either calculated risk that excites, or it is the Russian roulette bullet. Dubois' passion would be just an unconscious death wish, their relationship would be a terrible trap, a suicide disguised as a crime, and in which Charpin would be the victim. Your story is meaningless. We never split more than a day. And why should she have a lover? I saw. You were not in your normal state, there were adulteries everywhere. A biker! Does not make any sense. Life is not remade with a biker. I didn't say she wanted to remake her life, she said she had a lover! - Are you? - Have you arrived? Already. Great! What do you want to eat? I haven't gone shopping yet. - I don't dine here today. - Are you going to dinner with Juliette? Do not. I'm leaving, Nicolas. I leave you. I never forgave you this. Did you know? You could see the nose in the middle of the face. It was 81! In love there is no prescription, there is no forgiveness, there is no forgetting. There is condescension, concessions, weaknesses, yes, but that is all. What have you done in 15 years? Shopping, home and cooking. I have the impression of living with a butler. A couple doesn't just live on broccoli, Nicolas. I don't love you anymore. You have become hollow, without substance, banal. You don't bring me anything. I didn't imagine you like that. Good Morning. Could you install an Olini kit and a Terminoli exhaust? Could you install an Olini kit and a Terminoli exhaust? Sorry, but it is prohibited. Only if you want to walk on a track. It's for walking on a track. Is it possible for tomorrow? You must sign a document. It's ok. See you tomorrow. It's blue, over there... See you tomorrow. Maybe one day, genetics will prove that three men are biologically necessary for one type of woman, two women to one type of man, four to another, and five for another. And we will have nothing to say. Perhaps the genetic combination, determine the life expectancy of couples, the famous seven years! Who will discover the fidelity chromosome, that will guarantee the perpetuity of married life? And where there is this gene, is there also pleasure? Perhaps... But according to current knowledge, what drives our drives it is two thousand years of culture, education and laws. Two thousand years denied ahead of him by Nathalie and Dr. Dubois, more than Charpin could take. Could he let 20 centuries of culture and civilization smash like that? Could it or not? What boldness! Would love be a crime? It is not love. It is betrayal, cowardice, infamy. Love is a feeling that unites beings, it is not this union that fed on Charpin's suffering. It is audacious but it is a double-edged sword. Then accuse them, especially Dubois, turns him into a monster, with sex on the head. Follow your objective, underlines red, for everyone to understand well. Insists on the petty, miserable side of adultery, parallels their love story and Charpin's candor and innocence. Don't come anymore, Nicolas. I know, you know very well what you have to do. That's not it, it's your presence in the courtroom. Did not like? I was very upset. You were surprised. From now on I will come every day. - Stop, you hurt yourself. - No, on the contrary. It is a kind of exorcism. Not for me. I had the feeling of usurping the place to someone. - No. - I swear to you. I suddenly felt really unhappy. Your uncle saw you and made an unpleasant comment. I don't see with what right. You know very well. Well, I'm not coming anymore. It is a pity, I would like to know how you will defend yourself. I'll tell you. Let me die! Let me go! Let me die! Let me go! Let me die! I don't thank you. You're welcome. Have you ever thought about the courage it takes to commit suicide? Maybe I'll never have it again. I apologize. It was instinctive. - Did you want to impress someone? - No. In addition to being big, handsome and tanned, he has to be smart. - It's ok? - I'm leaving. If you had been quiet, I would no longer have to think about it. And don't expect me to thank you in 8 days, I won't be better. Maybe six months from now. You are optimistic. Nothing goes as badly as we think. - Do you think? - Think! But then nothing goes as well as we think. That's true. Are you Buddhist? No, why? You're welcome. Let's dry off. I'll get my things. I had left them here. It was a big guy, with a mustache, who took everything. Didn't you take him? - No. - So it was dishonest. I took off my boots and jacket and jumped. Are you the desperate? I am. Your name? Pierre Labbé. - Is that your real name? - IS. You should normally send it to "Hotel-Dieu". Even if I look after you? Is it family? I am, I am... Well, pretend. - Thank you. - Do I send a locksmith? Are you sure you are a locksmith? Security locks, just like that. Think about it before you lose the key. - How much is it? - 750 francs. - To break down a door? - It's displacement. My wallet was in the jacket. Do you want me to change the lock? For that price, I change. Thank you. - Is it your wife? - It's my fiancee. I didn't imagine it that way. Are you getting married? No, I don't think so. Why does my bride say? Bride, we are going to marry. Otherwise it is meaningless. Tell my concubine if you like what is beautiful. Concubine, is similar to Colombina. No, that’s not it. We don't live together. No wonder. He looks like a lover. So tell my lover. - As you wish. - I do not want anything! Call it what you want, my angel, my bunny, my love... In Poland they say "someone's ass". - Do you know him? - Yes, it's Marika, Louboch's ass. - Nothing delicate, but it is explicit. - It's a bit of a reducer. As much as "my heart". And how do you say "lover" in Poland? You are a pretentious. - Why did you do that? - My wife left me. - It's ridiculous! - Do you think? At 15, you die of love, at 20, it's a limit, but at your age, it's ridiculous. It is really very curious. The mature man would be more likely to kill... - I didn't even think about it. - Because you're still a young man! - It's not my wife's opinion. - Don't be bitter. You have grace, you have the role of the good. Maybe she'll come back. - No, women never come back. - It is true. See? Get another one. Statistically there is no doubt. A better one, maybe! - It's mine that I like. - I know, but I can't give it to you. So you shouldn't have taken me out of the water! You are not nice. I'm going to leave. I'll take it. My bike is down there. No, I'll walk. What are you going to do? Do not know. I'm going home... Leave me your address, I will send you 750 francs. It saved my life, it's more or less worth it, we're even. Keep my phone. You never know, if you want to talk to someone... Don't be silly, think about what I told you, tomorrow is a new day. Yes, that's it. Bye. It really is a neighborhood of thieves! Good morning, I would like to speak with Dr. Obini, please. - From? - From Mr. Aubac. Just a moment. - I am. - You won't believe what happened to me. Do you think it has to do with the season? No, it is pure chance. Juliette who throws herself at the Seine. Claire's husband who saves someone on the Saint-Martin canal. In three days, it seems like a lot. Pure chance! And then, what did he do? She took him over to their house for a drink. It's completely crazy. You don't take a stranger home. It can be crazy, it can come back, have a fixation on it. Maybe she hates him for saving him. - Do you think so? - Think. It is current in the history of crime. Take a guy out of prison, a tramp or an unemployed person, and he, as soon as he can, steal your silver chandeliers. It is known. It is called "Jean Valjean syndrome". He has to be careful, Claire's husband. Her too. This guy must have developed rampant misogyny. You should call him now. I don't have her number. I'll tell you tomorrow. - Do you want a grog? - I want. I wonder where did you get this? It was definitely at the fishmonger. Did you buy fish? No, it was very cold at the fishmonger. What if we got married? Why not? 39.5º, drink your grog. I won't be able to do Milan-San-Remo. It's to learn not to be a hero. If I knew... Do not say that. In fact, it has nothing to do. Nicolas has the same thing. Three days from now, it's over. - Do you think so? - Think. Promise me that if the crazy man comes back, you'll be careful. Because it happens often. They fixate on the person who saved them. He's not crazy, and even if he were, there's no problem, I'm much bigger. How were you when you were little? I was very short, the others called me the dwarf. Did you suffer from that? A bit. And thou? I wore glasses and a braces on my teeth. Can you imagine... - We were ugly ducklings. - Yes. But now we are beautiful white swans. You will catch my constipation. You are warm as a warm-up. It should be fine already. Good morning, it's Pierre. It's him. - Remember, you saved my life yesterday. - Yes, I remember, okay? No, I'm not doing well, I have a cold. Me too, if that consoles you... Have a fever? - Have. - How much? 39.5º. I'm 40, sometimes delusional, are you delusional too? I do not think so. It's horrible, delirious. Sometimes I have terrible coughing fits. Do you also have coughing fits? I have a cough, but it's not scary. What syrup do you take? Renatiol. I take Tulatou, but I don't think it's anything special. Try Renatiol. Now, goodbye. It's because of me that you're sick. Are you angry? No. If I had to do it again, I would do it. This looks like a virus... He overdoes it. What a talker. You told him you were busy. He's depressed. I couldn't hang up on him. Yes Yes. Hurry, we only have half an hour. Shit, they still have 20 minutes. Good morning my angel. Good morning, lazy. I am sick. You're good already. Nicolas was much better this morning. I'm better. What are you doing? I don't want the madman to catch us in the privacy. Are you going to Milan? I will. In the end, I would prefer you to be sick for another day or two. I'm not going for long. You go, abandon me. Kan Ji Zai Bo Za Tsu... Shit. I am? It is severe? It's ok. Where? I'll go now. It came at the right time. I'm not well. Can you take care of the apartment? - If you like it. - See you soon. Your husband will know everything - It came in the mail from 2 am. And it all? And it all. What are you going to do? I'll tell Nicolas everything. I don't want him to know that way. - Are you going to leave him? - I will. When? Tonight. If I had known, I would have sent you such a letter long ago. I wouldn't like it. You would never know it was me. I knew. Your letter would be kind. What are you thinking about? - Nicolas. - Are you sure he doesn't know anything? I'm sure. Someone came to my house to break everything, while I went to the drugstore. It was crazy! I'm really silly! He's at my house. Guarding the apartment. I'll call you later! I will call. I couldn't clean it, it makes me vomit! It doesn't matter. Dr. Obini, please. Yes, I am. It's all right. I'll call you before I leave. Do not worry, I explain to you. Kisses. I don't know what to say. Do not say anything. You are a cool guy, Pierre. Do not. I'm not. - Do you know Jean Valjean's syndrome? - No. It's a little bit complicated. It is a psychoanalytic theory. When we help someone, that person resents us, does not support duty favors, to anyone, and the recognition it has at the beginning, natural, instinctive, turns into fierce hatred, that can lead to crime. Do you call that psychoanalysis? For me, this is string psychology! And I think this theory has no feeling. No wonder you believed that. I confess that after thinking... But I believed. It was the husband, there is no doubt. No, he is a mole. - Do you know him? - No. In any case, I am not going to criticize him. Do you think this is normal? I'm not sorry, but I understand. And with your theories about the mature man, consider yourself happy. If it were me, I would have changed the lock for centuries. Maybe, but you didn't leave it all at your wife's lover's house. I am suicidal. It's another school. That would be easy, but not all cheated husbands are cowards. Suicide is not a coward. It is very beautiful. Except when we fail. It's not your fault. It was me... In any case, the intention is that it is beautiful, the gift of oneself. It is much more generous than going to break everything in people's homes. Sorry, I have to hurry up. I'm going to Italy early that night. What do you do? I'm a photographer on "Team". - Do you like it? - Much. I love photography and sports. - Live off your passion. - It says very well. I had a friend like that. His passion was underwater fishing. Since I was a kid, I only thought about it. He ended up on the Cousteau team. - Formidable! - It depends. It was eaten by a crocodile in the Australian sea. I don't see grace. Sorry, I thought you were kidding. They never take me seriously. I have to change the lock and my train is at 10 am. Let me guess... Milan-San-Remo? That's right. Do you like cycling? Not really, I heard guys talking in the cafe. This interests a lot of people, by all means, it would even have a tendency to stay in fashion. A few days ago, I made the same reflection. When will you be back? Sunday night. Can we have dinner together on sunday? I bury my single life. What? On Monday, my lover becomes my concubine. The photo? Yes. You told me earlier that you're going to leave your husband this weekend. I'd like to have dinner with you. I'm sorry, but on Sunday I can't. Excuse me. Don't always be sorry! Happiness is not shared, and that's it. It could have been a little passion, an instant of adolescence, one of those furtive relationships, which you confess when you're old, and that even the other ends up finding it funny. This idyll could have been love. These things happen without preventing... If so, what to do? Confess and leave, assume your love until the other's suffering. If we made a baby? What are you talking about? I don't know, I think it's normal, when we love each other, to make a child. A couple without a child, it’s not a couple, it’s shit, it’s something. Why do you say that to me? Because I love you. But why today? Because I love you today, because I no longer remember when you said I love you the last time, because Michel left Juliette, and everything is going wrong. What will become of Juliette without Michel? Sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. I know my love. Tell me you love me. I love you. Nicolas... I smiled. Are you angry? - No. - I'm leaving, Alice. Do you want to leave me? No, what would become of me without you? I'm leaving for a few days. I feel that right now I love you badly, I don't think I deserve you. I don't know what I have, I'm not the same, I feel soft. I better leave to build ideas, do you understand? Yes. A throbbing run is expected. The big maneuvers will start, nobody will give up, the pressure increases. On the left, Notre-Dame de Paris, cradle of the loves of the beautiful Esmeralda and the horrible Quasimodo. Yes sir! I put it here. So I don't forget. - Tonight, it's important. - Don't worry, I know what it is. Are you sure it's not just sexual? It is the idea that gives. Do you think? Think. I know it poorly, but honestly, I find it a little hollow. I don't know what they are going to talk about in 10 years! We'll see in 10 years. You can't answer like that. I will not be unhappy now, not to be 10 years from now! There is also Juliette in this story. There is also Romance. Juliette suffers. Romance was also going to suffer. Is not the same thing. Because? Do lovers suffer less? No but... A short relationship leaves fewer memories. It will be easier for her... For you too, I'm sure it shouldn't be easy. No. It is the choice that is difficult. Once the choice is made, we plunge into happiness. Good Morning. Good Morning. Mrs. Obini, they are waiting for you at the meeting point. Mrs. Obini, they are waiting for you at the meeting point. What a surprise! - I managed to come. - Thank you. Train 218 from Milan entered line 21. We have immense prejudices. I always thought sports journalists were assholes but I never read "Team". We're used to it. They're used to being silly! What is this? I waited for you all night. Where were you? Begins... You're being mean, saying that. And they are not yet living together! You have to understand it. It comes out of a stormy, maybe even violent, discussion that he tried to postpone for the whole weekend. He crossed Paris in a sordid taxi, he ran up the stairs, and he arrives, out of breath, fragile, vulnerable, looking for arms to take refuge in, and finds a closed door. Imagine your despair. - I have to call you now. - It's six in the morning. He's not sleeping. He says he waited all night. This is a figure of style. Nobody waits all night. You don't know her! She won't call you now, if it's her husband who answers... That's right. It was better to sleep. I have no sleep at all. I have. I am... Eight hours, zero minutes and twenty seconds. 18th century police, please say. Sorry, it's a mistake. Please, it happens to everyone. You are the world I live in. I love you. Nicolas. Poor idiot. Pleasure of love, lasts just a moment Did you see the price? He will not eat it on paper plates. She does not care! Don't think that. So far, he has only known the pleasure of hiding, but now, you will discover the charm of everyday life, and you’ll have to be aware, because she won’t forgive you. Do you think? I realized this too late. We must end up recognizing that you are a monster, Charpin! No, I'm not a monster, I loved her! And I still love her. What should I have done to make you believe me? Turn the gun on me? She was dying, there, at my feet. I saw her looking at me, her eyes full of tears. It was my fault, and I couldn't do anything anymore. How do you shoot a crowbar at yourself? I am innocent, I am innocent, they condemn an ​​innocent! Calm down, let's go. You shut up, bitch, this is all your fault! They all say the same. Yes, but this one tells the truth. We haven't seen each other in a while. Yes. Do we have lunch together one of these days? I really liked it. I do not. It's different. It is now our home. Not yet, my love. - Were you disappointed? - I stayed. Are you angry? No, I realize that it must not be easy. I did not make it. He's not well, I didn't realize it. He needs me. It's just a matter of timing, it was not the right time, I thought so... You don't have to justify yourself. Yes, I would like to explain. Don't move! Stone falling into the water, no mirror breaks. It's indecent Are you going to throw yourself into the water? Nicolas! What are you doing here? Nothing, I'm walking. I feel so alone, you know? Of course I understand. I only know couples, women alone or prisoners. I want to remake my life. You have to redo it, you're still young, attractive, it would be a waste. - Do you think so? - Clear. Give me a kiss. Another. He was handsome! As soon as he finished the course, he entered a prestigious office. He was entrusted with an important case in the criminal court. She was a very beautiful and very guilty young woman. He fell in love quickly. He soon realized that she was indefensible, that there was nothing I could do for her. At that time, there was a death penalty. He could have avoided it, but it didn't interest him. He wanted her free. One day he hid a file in his pocket to give it to the palratory. Unfortunately, he was clumsy. In the corridor, in front of the guards, the file fell. Evidently, it was said that she had combined everything, that had seduced him just for that. He swore to me no, who had the idea that morning. I only know that she was sentenced to death and then acquitted. - I think it's still in "Fresnes". - It's him? The father is a president and the uncle is a judge. They merely expelled him from the bar. His career was broken. I already admired him a lot, but after this story, half, but I loved him... It was new, I thought it was so beautiful. In fact I still find it very beautiful. It is true, it is very beautiful. We started living together, it was as if I had collected it. I don't think he loved me, at least at first. When I started to defend, he helped me to prepare the files, writing my defenses. He watched the hearings on the sly. Then, at night, he made his criticism. One day, he realized that it was no longer worth it, which was just for your own pleasure, and then stopped. No, please. Aren't you? Not today. It's not simple, you know. No, I don't know. Don't be angry. I need you. I'd rather you love me. What do you mean? You sleep with me but you live with him. Find out that I also sleep with him. Sorry, I needed to see you. Did I wake you up? No, I was reading. - Are you better? - I'm going. - I have a lover. - I've known for a long time. So it was you ?! - Is Alice in? - No. Come in, don't bother. Did not come? Came. Want stewed cod? Still left? - Didn't she like it? - She didn't even taste it! It is the beginning of the end, my dear. Do not exaggerate. It was our first night together and she didn't stay... You're paying for last night. She didn't leave her husband, she didn't say anything. I'm just an adventure... She still likes him, just told me about him. It's even reassuring, he's a formidable guy, you know? Seriously? He must have been suspicious and left in good time. Well done. It is said "out of sight, out of mind", but being away, it gets closer. Sometimes, when a man is worth it, women return. At least, we learned that. You should go home, she's waiting for you. - Who? - Your woman. - Do you think? - I am sure. - Is that you? - I'm going for a walk. Do you want me to leave you somewhere? I want. What do you want now? Introduce yourself to a formidable guy! - Is it Juliette? - Yes. - I'm Gaspard. - Nice to meet you, Gaspard. Good morning, it's me. Good morning, where are you? In Brest. Are you better? Much better. I'll be back tomorrow. Are you happy? - Stay. - So, see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. It doesn't matter. Goodbye, Gaspard. Goodbye, Juliette. Marie Fournond, how did you feel about Charpin? I loved him. It is not a crime. - Did you know he was married? - Yes. What was his feeling about you? - He loved me too. - Lie. Shut up, Charpin! "You say Charpin loved you, did he tell you?" - Yes. Lie, I don't love her. I never loved you! I finished the witness's interrogation. Dr. Obini, any questions? Excuse me? Do you want to ask the witness anything else? Sorry, Mr. President. I don't want to ask anything. It's not possible! She's lying! Fools! This is not defense! It's nonsense! The hearing is suspended! She is a girl with a pint! They could have made a beautiful couple. - That can't be decided. - I know. I am, yes, yes. Until now, a kiss. Nine o'clock, in the evening, you bring dessert! I love you! I love you, I love you... Do you think I can ask Pierre to be the best man? Sure, why not? I'll try to find a cute, single godmother, you never know... It will open, I'm ready in 30 seconds. Good night. - Is it Pierre? - His name is Nicolas! Open it. Do not abras. Pass it to me. No, Pierre. Shit, Labbé Pierre! Come on. Your documents. - Are your documents? - Are. Your case becomes complicated. - I'm entitled to a phone call. - Count on it. Article 78 of the penal code, paragraph 3. Call Dr. Obini. The dishes, was it? He gave me his opinion. It's for you, it's the police. I am... I have Mr. Gardinier in front of me. Nicolas, Bruno, Rémy, born on 6 June 1944 in Arromanches. Yes, that's it. Tell him to screw. I will take note of your testimony. My name is Nicolas Gardinier, I was born on June 6, 1944... At 6, at Christmas, I managed to save the turkey, we eat duck with chestnuts. It was an early vocation. I became a "domestic servant", it was revolutionary at that time. Her friends were crazy about me, I could have enjoyed them all but I didn't. Take note, it is important. Now it's over, the poets' time is over. Anyway, I don't know how to talk to women anymore. Before, yes. Anyway... He had an air of softness. I thought he wasn't going to get me. And the fool, dove. And someone stole my motorcycle! I tried to call from a booth, but he wouldn't let me through... And in that moment, you have arrived. And ready! It will take a long time to write it all down. It's fine, go home. - Are you going to get croissants? - I will. - I wanted to talk to her. - No, Pierre. My name is Nicolas. It's the same thing. It's no use. Go home! See life differently Because? They didn't want me. Although I tell you that I was Hungarian. It's for you. For me? I looked for you everywhere. I wandered a bit. Do you want to tell me something? I'll be right back!
