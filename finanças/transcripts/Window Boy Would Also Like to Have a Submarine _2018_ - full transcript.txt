Here it is. I found it when I came to gather firewood. I don't often come here. I've never seen it before. The grass around is tall. It looks like it's been here for a long time... because of the moss it has. Why are we only seeing it now though? Don't open it! It might be cursed. Stand back. Listen... We should watch the shed. Felix and Carding... you will stay tonight. I'll ask my wife to prepare you something for dinner. - Shall we leave now? - Yes. Let's leave. Keep watch. Ok. Take care. Make sure that nobody goes inside. We need to discuss this with everyone. To decide what to do about the shed... and organize the next shifts. Tomorrow night Noli and Efren will stand guard. Ok. No problem. I'd rather not stand guard at night. I think we should inform to the authorities instead. No. We will not inform to the authorities. They won't help. And too many people will find out. I don't want to go. You should do it anyway. Ok. - That's the way down over here. - Ok. Here we are. Glad you came. We didn't get much sleep. - It's really cold. - Come closer to the fire. Joey says he heard vibrations... coming from inside. You should go back home. We will take over. Thank you. We will try to be careful... to listen for strange noises. Ok. Noli! Noli! Are you ok? Yes. Noli... What are you doing here? Why aren't you sleeping with your wife? I can't go back. I had a dream whilst guarding the shed. I dreamt I was inside the shed and I could see my house. When I entered the house I could see a snake swallowing my wife... and then my little daughter as well. And then it became huge... and slowly started destroying the village. The spirits of the mount may be testing you. You need to get some rest. You don't want? I don't know. What if it becomes true? They are only dreams. They have no power. So what's the point in worring about them? Let it go. They won't come true. Ah Noli, come and have a drink. Attention all crew. In a few minutes we will be starting the security exercises. We ask you to go to your master stations. Thank you. You missed your shift once. Then you missed your shift a second time. Then a third time. Now you go to clean the boats. If it happens again... you have to leave. Hey, have you seen the boy? No. Why? Nobody seen him. Boy! Boy! Hello? Is anyone there? Victory on penalities for Nacional against Cali. We will be commenting on some other details... linked to the transfer market. National just received Marcos Angeleri... who, curiously, scored yesterday. Well, lets see some of the action... of the match that closed the double day... Just as yesterday we saw Pe帽arol's victory over Millionarios... This is a curious goal: it reflects off Magallanes and relocates the goalkeeper Centuri贸n. A penalty on each side, because it broke the net and it was a goal. Here is the decisive one that the young National goalkeeper stops for the tricolour victory. We have our last break and we go to the movies with Jackie Rodriguez Stratta. We'll be back. From this Monday, at the end of Master Chef... Dad, where is mom now? Our things are outside! Please help us! Are we going to live here? Take something with us. Give him a beer. And you, hotty? Water. Good idea, honey. You want a Sake? Whisky. How old am I, twelve? Boy! When you finish here you go to the deck four downstairs, ok? At the stern. Ok! Make sure everything goes well. Hello. Nobody is here. That's odd... He couldn't get in from here either. Are you sure you don't want me to call the police? No, no... But I saw him... He is a little bit shorter than me, he was wearing blue... He rushed out... He isn't here now. Please call me if something happens. I don't understand. Thank you so much. I know you are here. Where are you? Do you want me to call somebody? I don't understand. Where did you enter? From the balcony? No. Can I spend the night here? Good morning. I have a meeting with the attendant. Look for yourself. This one, right? Yes. That is the thread. Excuse me. A souvenir. The closest thing to the world of a sailor... I lived it with the scouts. Because I went to the scouts. When I was a girl. I used to sing a song... That sometimes I sing... But I don't remember the whole song... So I invent some parts. You want me to sing it for you? Yes. I'm going south... down the river I go... where a better living... is waiting for me. The solitude... that there is in my way... helps me to hear... the sound of the sea. Under this sky... looking at stars... i'm going south... i'm going south. Cross the hill... cross waterfalls... I'm going south... I'm going south... It's pouring! I am going to bed. You can stay here if you want. Madame. Excuse me, you cannot stay here. This is the crew area. Where should I go? You can go up those stairs. Where? Those stairs will lead you to the second deck. Thank you. I can get you a job, if you prefer to stay. Ok. Try this on. Show me, come here. You all come, you come. Come over here, faster. Look at that, look. Be careful! It's so strange... Again! There, there... they left. Yes. And now she's playing with the ball. Oh. There, there is another with flower-like hair. It's nice. Make sure it's at the same height. Leave it there. At this height it's ok. There. Take it. It's well tied. With this chicken... we call on you all... Kiyangan Kabbigat, Bugan, Accept this chicken we offer in sacrifice. We call on you all and your sons... we call on you all. Come out and bless us that we may live... so we can make more wine and satisfy you with our offering. Bring the other chicken for the spirits. This one? Any of them. That one is too small. Give me a big one for the spirits. The bile isn't good. - Are you sure? - Yes. Give me the other one. The bile should be darker. Please look at this other one. Here you have. It doesn't seem good. Here you can see the bile. Take a look. It isn't good. It's full but still white. We did everything and yet... We call all the spirits... and none responded favorably. I cannot even sleep. Because... what kind of strange shed is this one? Even calling the elders... and there is no sign. We can do it again and again... but no spirit accepted our offerings. We agreed not to return home until we could solve this. Why should I not go home? I have work to do. Don鈥檛 be like that. We aren't leaving without... getting adequate protection. So... we will make this good before we go home. Yes, because no matter how many chicken... and how many pigs are butchered and sacrificed... they weren't enough to summon the spirits. And still the gall bladder interpretation isn't good. But what if... we cannot make the shed... stop being a threat? We can't return home then? Joey heard noises again... coming from inside. Is that true, Joey? Yes. The shed is trembling. It is a danger to continue staying here. We have to talk to the elders again. it seems that there was an earthquake inside. It is just like that. I don鈥檛 understand why but it is just like that. Did you hear? It came from there. I keep thinking about what that noise was. Let us drink. See if there is some food so we can eat. Is the shed safe? The snake is destroying the village. It has swallowed my wife... and my daughter. This one is my daughter's shoe. It's the only thing I keep... from her. Let me enter. You, our Ifugao spirits who are gathered here in this forest... spirits from Bangaan... you go home respectively. You also spirits from Hungduan... so that we can all go home... as brothers safe and sound. Somebody is there? Where am I? Where am I? You came from there? I don't understand you. I want to return to my village. Where is the door? Where am I? Let us destroy this shed which only brought misfortune... and cause trouble amongst the villagers. That its destruction may dissolve the curse it brought with it. And that we will all... live safe in this land. Yes, tell us when it's time. Go away! Window boy would also like to have a submarine
