[spooky music] [music intensifies] [thunder] [far away howling] [suspenseful music, thunder continues] [playful music] [shattering glass] [howling] [suspenseful chord] [creaking] [eerie music] Here's to you, baby. Ten years of misery. Sl√°inte [spooky music] You never did like taking it on the face. Well how's that now, huh? Come to think of it, I think it's high time I cashed in on all those years you never tended to my needs. Whine, whine, whine. Me, me, me. Well what about me? [suspenseful chord] Huh? I'm thinking it's time for a little bit of dead head. [wind howling] You won't mind. Much. [zzipper and suspenseful chord] Shit. [crunch and wet meat] Jesus and mother of God! Fuck. [muffled growling and chuckling] Let go of my meat! [howling] Let go of my meat! [howling] [panting] [thunder] [eerie music] [thunder] [intense suspenseful music] No. No. No. No. No. No. No! You bitch! You bit off my bean bag! [suspenseful chord and sound of wet meat] [cell phone ringing] Fucker! [shouting] Yeah? [funny mumbling over phone] Balls! He is? [funny mumbling] Yeah, I'll be there, I'll be there, yeah. Jesus wept! Yeah, fine! [wind softly howling] [animal howling] [thunder] I'm late for work. [cheerful rock music] [horn honking] [sighing] [rock music continues] [tuning radio] [woman's voice] Will you stop touching that. (man) Honey, what is... What was the station again? I can never remember the number. (woman) I don't know. You're supposed to know 'cause I can never remember, so it's your job to remember. Well, remind me why we're bringing our baby to an all-night splatter fest again. Are you serious? I wish that I had parents as cool as [indistinct] He's gonna be so prepared for life in modern America, after this evening of films. I know. [snapping] Yeah. [cheerful rock music over radio] I love it when the old man pumps golden moldies in the channel after the all-nighters. You know, I'm totally puts me in the mood. Yeah, look what happened the last time Otis Redding was on. Uh-huh? Uh-huh. Do you want a brother? (baby) Little brother, daddy. (Ryan) All right, Tobe. Six degrees, Kevin Bacon, Bela Lugosi. Hit it! (Tobe) Oh, no. Oh man, this should be cake and ice cream for you. (man 2) Oh, come on. Forget it, I... I... I guess this encyclopedia is human after all. So what movie is everyone freaking out about? 'Cause I'm going into the [indistinct] Well, I haven't seen any of them. Apparently, Mr. K., has the only prints of these things in existence. It's like ultra rare Holy Grail shit. Right, Tobes? Yeah, this being the last hurrah and all is the best time as ever to unleash the terror, the blood, the boobs! More blood! More boobs! Hurray for boobs. What was it like working here, I mean, Hog heaven, right? No, nerdgasm. I saw the movie Hungry Hungry Hippos 13 times! I see no nutritional value in that whatsoever. Hey, you asked! And besides, it gave you an excuse to almost talk to a certain concession employee. Wait. Almost? So you haven't even like... No. Okay? We haven't even. We're taking it slow. Mm-hm. And by "slow" he means turn the other way and walk fast. So you haven't even talked to her? It's like this. A girl like Desi is never gonna go out with me so I figure, why not hold on to the hope instead of suffer the disappointment? You should at least talk to her before you go back to school. At least then you could make a piece. Yeah, look who's talking potsy! Well, what the fuck does that mean? Oh, nothing. Yeah, nothing, just... Look, Kevin Bacon and Elvis Presley. (Tobe) Let's do it. [Chuckling] [woman chuckling] [swoosh] Admit two. There you go, kids. Just pull up to the front row spot and tune your tunes to 106. 1 and enjoy. [chuckling] It's gonna be a hell of a night! [chuckling] (man) Yeah, thanks. [rolls up window] "It's gonna be a hell of a night!" Fuck you, get real. I'm so glad to see this fucking dump decimated. Jesus, man. Lighten up. Oh, I'll lighten up tomorrow when the bulldozzers gas up. So remind me why we're here instead of Schneideman's. Because I pulled the short straw and got stuck with baby sitting duty. 9:00 AM this is another fine Blumps location. [horn honking] Until then, I gotta keep an eye on the old man make sure he doesn't pull any shenanigans. Well, Mr. Sourpuss. Excuse me, that's Junior VP at Marketing Sourpuss. Okay, Mr. VP Poopy Pants, I promise to make tonight worth your while. (man) Oh. (announcer) Show starts in five minutes. [rattling] [cheerful music] I don't know, Orson. Looks like last licks for us old bones. I'm gonna miss all this. This was my favorite part. The preparation and anticipation. The threading, splicing the reels, and always racing the clock. Betty and I, we never missed a single listing. In the gate and don't be late. You taught me that. My rosebud. Well, who needs to be on time now when you've got demanding video and high definition crap? You can get anytime at home. Who needs the old night out under the stars with some movie magic anymore? That's what you were all about. Right? Magic tricks and slight of hand. Nobody cares for magic anymore. Nope. [sighing] The world gets smaller. And soul mates fade away like old Kodak film stock. But nothing's gonna stop me from sharing a bit of that magic tonight! Right? [chuckling] But, much like anything else... [rattling] [clears throat] Now she's gone. Now this place is pretty much gone. And like tomorrow, I may be gone, too. Fade to black. Right? [chuckling] Or maybe a smash cut! [laughing] [door bangs open] Jumping Jesus! Jehoshaphat Floyd. Heart hopping Christ, you're late, man. Sorry, boss, I've been, uh, I've been dealing with some... [coughing] Family matters. Well, there's no need for excuses now, I'm already done threading the first film. Good God, man! What have you been sticking your dick into? You look like hell on a hand grenade. I've been under the weather. Look, why don't you just go check in with concessions, see if Desi needs some help? Sounds good. Okay. And for Christ's sake, man, clean yourself up! [door shuts] It's show-time! [chuckling] [thunder and screaming recording] Well, hell, ell, ell, ello, kiddies! [chuckling] It's your old friend, Uncle Cecil, welcoming you to the final, ghoulish night of murder and mayhem! [vicious laughter] Yes, my ghouls and gals, it's time for Chillerama! [vicious laughter] [horns honking] Sit back, poke a hole in the bottom of your pop-corn bag, cuddle up to the closest corpse and prepare yourself for this evening's first squishy selection. Wadzilla! [vicious laughter] [rooster] [joyous classical music] [eerie chord] [mangled chords and wet meat] [shrill eerie music] [swoosh] Excuse me, Dr. Weems. Miles Munson's lab work is ready. Tell him I'll be right in. [whispering] Okay. (Miles) I never heard of a sperm bank turning anyone down before. You can imagine my nervousness when they suggested I see a urologist. It isn't anything serious, is it? Life-threatening, no. As a matter of concern, yes. Have a look in there, Miles. (Miles) Wow! Look at them all go. (doctor) That is an example or normal sperm. And that is your sperm. [ominous music] (Miles) Yikes. [suspenseful chord] That doesn't look good. Miles, there's a new medication I'd like to suggest you try. It's called Spermupermine. Now, it can't increase the sperm you generate but what it can do, is strengthen the sperm you already produce. Spermupermine? Yes. It hasn't been approved by the FDA yet, but it is available to test subjects. Luckily for you, I'm on the research board. [Chuckling] Thank you, doctor. [shouting] (man over TV) Good morning, kids! It's the Captain Fatso Show. And I'm Captain Fatso! [shouting] Well, ahoy there, Captain Fatso, say, are those gumdrops I smell? (Fatso) Look kids, it's Dudley Dingleberry! [kids shouting] (Fatso) I'm starving! I haven't even had breakfast yet! (Fatso) Let me tell you about the new sponsor! [shouting] [suspenseful music] [TV show continues] [music stops] (Fatso over TV) Peanut Mush is now enhanced with new flavored chemicals. Makes your breakfast even more scrump-dilly-dumptious! Sounds de-lish. [shouting] Morning, Miles. Uh, morning, Larry. Hey, you still single, buddy? Unfortunately. My wife's college roommate just got divorced and moved to town. Perfect for you. You should take her to dinner tomorrow night. Absolutely not. No way, no more blind dates. Not after last time. Come on, she's perfect. You should just do this, okay? She's cute. She's not looking for anything serious. Just a little companionship. You know? [train horn] [playful music] [jazzzzy music] Oh. Allow me. [suspenseful chord] Oh. [grunting] Miles, are you okay? Come here. I just had a horrible shooting pain in my balls. You think you sat on your balls when you sat down? I don't know. Oh! You twisted the veins in your testicles. Classic vein twist. Okay. Okay. [panting] I'm good. I'm so... (man) Okay, onto the consolidation of our acquisitions of General Textile Industries and MBT Plastics. For a brief overview, we'd like to introduce to you all the newest member of our department, Andie Sumner. [jazzzzy music] Hello, gentlemen. [jazzzzy music] Oh! [sighing] I'm such a klutzz. Oh. [grunting] Are you okay? Someone, help him up. No, I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. Ugh. I just need a little bit of air. I'm sorry. Excuse me for one second. [grunting] I don't know if it has anything to do with the pills that you gave me, but every time I get the least bit aroused I get the most intense shooting pain [whispering] through my testicles. Tsk. Well, there's only one way to find out. [scream and suspenseful chord] What in God's name... [suspenseful music] Miles? Are you all right? I think so. Give me the sample, Miles, so we can get it under the microscope right away. I don't think you're gonna need a microscope. Oh! [wet meat] [panting] My God. What's wrong with me? It's impossible, but it would appear that the Spermupermine has had an adverse effect on your system. It's not only strengthening your spermatozzoa but it's causing it to grow to gargantuan proportions. And traditionally, when a man experiences arousal, his testicles produce more sperm. But in your case, however, when you get turned on, the one sperm you do have gets huge. [wet meat] [suspenseful music] I'm gonna send this to the National Institute of Health in Washington for analysis. Discontinue use of the medication immediately. If you feel your sperm enlarging again you get it out of your system right away. Get it out of my system? Jerk off! Fast! [sighing] [cheerful Latino music] [knocking] [soft music] Hi. You must be Miles. [suspenseful chord] I'm Louise. [suspenseful music, intensifying] [grunting] [suspenseful chord] No. Oh, my God! What happened? Are you... Are you okay? May I use your bathroom just for a minute, please? Of course. Come right in. Right down the hall. I'll just be one second and I'll be back. Oh. [grunting] [suspenseful music continues] [growling] Molly, just what kind of a nut did you and Larry set me up with? Hon, Louise says that Miles showed up at her door, grabbed his crotch and started screaming. Wha... He's... He's in the bathroom now, he's making weird... I can hear him. (Larry) Louise, Miles twisted a vein in one of his testicles. Yeah, it hurts him sometimes. He feels bad about it. Don't make a fuss over it. He's a good guy. Okay. That is enough out of you. I'm so sorry. No, it's gonna be okay. He's just a brute. That guy is such an asshole. [gasping] I can hear him. The poor guy... Now I just feel sorry for him. [intense suspenseful music] [shouting] [loud thud] [wet meat] [grunting] [suspenseful chord] [clink] She hung up. [ominous music] [thumping and wet meat] [thumps and crashing] [glass shattering] [knocking] Miles? [thumping] Are you all right in there? [grunting, crashing] [wet meat] Ugh! [flushing] [sighing] That was a close one. [ominous music] Oh, no! [Louise, knocking] Miles. I'm getting very concerned. It sounds like something broke in there. You don't happen to have a plunger, do you? Oh. Just what in the hell happened in here? I'm on a new medication. [splashing] Oh! [growling] Oh, my God! [ominous music] It's getting bigger! [growling] Run! [Louise, screaming] No! Run! Ugh. [growling and squealing] [screaming] Oh! [screaming] [screaming] [screaming and sound of wet meat] [growling] [Louise, screaming] [crash] [growling] [glass shattering] [thump] [gurgling] Um. I can explain that. He's a nice guy, don't get me wrong, but... "Nice" just don't count in the bedroom when you got a baby gherkin between your legs. Come on, Stewie. Make a poo poo for momma, Come on, be a good boy. I'm not exaggerating. The guy's hung like Howdy Doody, and that's being generous. [ominous music] [chuckling] Of course I'm gonna see him again. Did you see his car? It's a Cadillac. No, that sizze was more than acceptable... [eerie sound and dog whining] Stewie! Will you please shut up? I'm sorry. He flunked obedience school. The mongoloid. [ominous music] [wet meat] [whining] [monster growling, dog whining] Why does it smell like Ajax? [loud growl] Stewie! Ow! You almost dislocated my... Stewie? [ominous chord] I have to call you back, mom. Stewie just escaped from his leash again. There you are. [wet meat] You furry fugitive, you. You'd better get your little butt over here before... [gasping] [growling] [wet meat sound] [squirting sound] [accordion music] [loud thump] [metallic clanking] [ominous chord] [clanking continues] [shouting] You almost gave me a heart attack. Me too! What'd you get? [chuckling] [humming] [chuckling] A Milk Dud. [laughing viciously] So, what did you find? Half a rotisserie chicken. [laughing] You're gonna split that with me, right? Yeah. Maybe. For a hand job. [suspenseful music] Don't be such a prude, Babs. It's not like you ain't done it 100,000 times already. Sp... Sperm! Exactly! [growling] [suspenseful music, intensifying] [growling] [crunch and splatter] Bob! [woman shouting] [running footsteps] [growling] [shouting] [clanking and shouting] [shouting, echoing] I want to thank you for being so understanding. You know, a lot of girls would've run for the hills if the sperm of their blind date shot up their skirt like that. So, thanks again. I swear to God, I will pay for any damages. Oh, please, things can be replaced. Testicles can't. Now that's for sure. I'm just glad you're... Uh. Louise? What's the matter? [panting] Oh, my God. Miles. That's your sperm. (TV presenter) This just in. The tadpole-like creature is running rampant as it heads downtown. Five are dead already and unconfirmed reports claim the slimy beast is now the sizze of a house and growing! Military leaders are described as "testy" when asked how to defend against this gargantuan goo. The military is doing its best to determine what it would take to rub one out of this sizze. What are we gonna do? We gotta get the authorities. Come on! Citizzens are asked to use whatever protection they can and avoid the creature's immediate vicinity which authorities are calling, "the wet spot". [ominous music] [growling and eerie chords] [thunder] We're reporting live from downtown Manhattan at the epicenter of the crisis zzone with a sperm creature which has now risen to five stories high and apparently still growing has been wreaking havoc on New York. The Mayor is insisting that all New Yorkers remain in their homes until further... Oh, my God. It's coming. [shouting] [growling] [splatter] [growling] (TV presenter) The stupendous spermatozzoa is ravaging through Central Park. Oh, the humanity! [gunshots] [crash and crunch] [explosion] The spermicide is having absolutely no effect. What does this sperm want, doc? What every sperm wants, General. To fertilizze an ovum! There's not an ovum on God's green earth big enough for that thing. (Miles) Wait! I just figured it out. The Statue of Liberty. It's the only conceivable female large enough. [ominous music] [sweet eerie music] [growling softly] [ominous music] [choppers] Steady. Steady. [growling] [ripping] Ah! Dammit. Oh, my God! Don't panic, there's gotta be another one here. (General) No time. Look! [growling] [ominous music] [growling] [squealing] [growling] Attention! This is General Bukkake. Initiate Operation Moneyshot. Three. Two! One! [whistling] [explosion] [joyous classical music] (Miles) Ah. [Ugh. [chuckling] Some first date, huh? [chuckling] You can say that again. Well, at least it's good for the skin. Yeah. [triumphant music] What? What's the matter? Nothing. [triumphant music continues] Miles! [music stops] All right. Fuck it. [triumphant music] Hm. [ominous music] [grunting] [spooky music] Oh, yeah. Classic cinema. Wow. If you liked Remains of the Day then you'll cream over Wadzilla. You know? Not enough tits. Wow. Ryan. Be your brother much? Mayna, don't insult me. (Tobe) Okay, substance run.

Nurse Maleva, you've gotta help me. Just calm down. Tell me everything. You were right. Talon, the twins, they're not just different, they're... They're... Werebears. Werebears! I'm sorry. I don't understand. Where I am from, there is old saying. Even a boy who thinks he's straight yet shaves his balls by night, may become a Werebear from the hormones of age and the latent urge takes flight. So you're saying... Once bitten, anytime you get aroused, you become that which bit you. And you attack those you lust after. Lust after? I think you know what I'm talking about. [playful ping] Homo! No. I am not a homo! I'm a, Werebear. [ominous chord] [cheerful rock music] Looking for these? [sighing] I'm going to the police. Well, don't forget to tell them what you did to good old Coach Tuffman. He was trying to molest me. Ricky. Ricky. Ricky. You can't molest the willing. [growling] [light growl] You're such a cub, Ricky. All show and no go. Who's talking about not being like everybody else, you just wanna be you. This is you. No. You did this to me. [thump] You could ask yourself a question, brother. [panting] Did the bite put the beast in you? Or let it out. [snapping] ‚ô´ Love, love, love Bit me on the ass ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Love bit me on the ass ‚ô´ ‚ô´ It got me by surprise ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Love bit me on the ass ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Took teeth to realizze ‚ô´ ‚ô´ That I'm just A lonely boy ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Yes, deep down I'm blue ‚ô´ ‚ô´ But when I'm unleash the beast ‚ô´ ‚ô´ To myself I'm true ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Love, love, love, Bit me on the ass ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Love bit me on the ass ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Bit me deep down too ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Love bit me on the ass ‚ô´ ‚ô´ But no way am I like you ‚ô´ ‚ô´ I may be quite different ‚ô´ ‚ô´ But I am not a beast ‚ô´ ‚ô´ I just want to cuddle ‚ô´ ‚ô´ And you just wanna feast ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Love, love, love, Bit me on the ass ‚ô´ ‚ô´‚ô´ Love, love, love ‚ô´‚ô´ [both, growling] Meet me tonight at the luau. It's gonna be a bloodbath. What do you mean [growling] with "bloodbath"? It means that the guys are gonna shake things up at the school dance. Payback time for those small-minded haters. [Chuckling] I can't be part of that, Talon. You can't be part of that. This is not how you gain acceptance. [panting] Well, then I guess I'll see ya when I'll see ya. [soft pop music] ‚ô´ I saw you dancing ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Barefoot in the sand ‚ô´ ‚ô´ I can love you Like no other can ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Sexy ways Sexy ways ‚ô´ ‚ô´‚ô´ Sexy ways Sexy ways ‚ô´‚ô´ [applause] [audience booing] You've all given us such a warm welcome this first week at school. You definitely deserve this next number, it's, uh, It's pretty bear-tastic. [rock music begins] ‚ô´ Well, we got a new dance It's the hit of the land ‚ô´ ‚ô´ All you gotta do is thrust when you stand ‚ô´ ‚ô´ [indistinct]a squeal, a grunt, and a squirt ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Yeah, it's called the Warebear And it just might hurt ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Let's do the Werebear ‚ô´ ‚ô´ And let The Werebear do you ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Let's do the Werebear ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Right here in Malibu ‚ô´ (all) Yeah! ‚ô´ Sweeping the nation Just like civil rights Werebear ‚ô´ ‚ô´ It's the latest sensation For long long lonely nights ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Werebear ‚ô´ I knew you would come, son. ‚ô´ Four, three, two, thrust ‚ô´ I know now what I must do, Maleva. ‚ô´ Three, thrust ‚ô´ ‚ô´ I wanna do it again Let's do the Werebear ‚ô´ ‚ô´ And let The Werebear do you ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Let's do the Werebear ‚ô´ ‚ô´ Right here in Malibu ‚ô´ Yeah! ‚ô´ One, two, three, thrust ‚ô´ [moaning] ‚ô´ One, two, three, thrust One, two, three, thrust ‚ô´ [growling] ‚ô´ Do it again ‚ô´ [moaning] ‚ô´ One, two, three, thrust Oh, it never has to end ‚ô´ ‚ô´ One, two, three, thrust One, two, three, thrust ‚ô´ [growling and shouting] ‚ô´‚ô´ One, two, three, Thrust, oh! ‚ô´‚ô´ ‚ô´ Everybody gather round ‚ô´ [audience gasping] ‚ô´ You better not let This madness go down ‚ô´ ‚ô´ They got good lines They fuck real good ‚ô´ ‚ô´‚ô´ But they just want To make you their food ‚ô´‚ô´ Yeah! [music stops] [both growling] Violence and hatred is not the answer. If we are to be accepted we must show love and tolerance. There are human beings out there, Talon. Not snacks. [chuckling] Nice speech, Gandhi. But we're hungry! [suspenseful music] [shouting] [ominous music] [general screaming and growling] [suspenseful music continues] (Talon) I freed you from a life of conformity. I unleashed you from the mundane.

[shouting and suspenseful chord] [both panting] [sad music] Maybe... I should've been more like you. We can change the world together. You still can. [panting] Go get 'em, kid. Make sure you tell them that I'm not a monster. You know, Werebears need love too. [howling] (Tobe) Wow. Not enough gay. (Ryan) Yeah, I mean, De Palma, ripping this off for Carrey? (Tobe) Why are you surprised? It's De Palma. What... What I don't get, is if they just shaved their chests wouldn't their curse be lifted? I mean, that's what it took to be a Werebear. Right? Uh. Sure. I feel like I would've used something less invasive. You know, like, instead of a dildo, maybe a silver razzor. [chuckling and squeaking sound] What was that? That's what scientists refer to as the one cheek sneak. Anyone want anything from the concession stand? I'm gonna go talk to Mr. K. I'm good. Nah, just bring Desi back if you can. Yeah, sure, I'll be right back. [clearing throat] [farting] [continues farting] Is it hot in here or is it just me? It's you. How 'bout you sideburns, want some of this milk it may cool you off?

Spit in the eye of morality and feast on the art of the damned. With a film that will test your tastes and rock the very fabric of your senses!

Standing by. Hm. Nerdy one. Yeah, and you getting that line makes you one of the good ones. [door closing] Which makes me, the final girl. (Announcer) And now, on with the show. [thunder and screaming recording] Well, my Chilly Chillens, I hope you're still with us for the long [indistinct] [vicious laughing] (Mr. K.) For this popular abomination you've all been waiting for. The final sinful centerpiece, of our last evening together. Hey. So, I need to get something off my chest. L... I... (Mr. K. You are gonna see some serious shit! Whoa. It's just like in the movies, huh? L... I... I got nothing. (Mr. K) The most vile and offensive stock of celluloid. Here is Deathication. [laughing viciously] [spooky music] [door opening] Oh, hello. I didn't see you there. Come in, won't you? Would you mind, uh, closing the door, please? [closing door] Thank you very much. As I was saying, my name is Fernando Phagabeefy. Internationally known and respected film maker. The visionary mastermind behind notorious cinematic works such as, The Cunting Death, Salo 2, The Next Day and of course, Rosemary's Picnic Table. I here now to present to you my latest and greatest moving picture. A film so scandalous, so intense, that it was banned from every film festival in fear of mass hysteria, and destroyed seating. The next 87 minutes you're about to endure a motion picture I've directed called, Deathication, comes with a very serious warning. This film was specifically produced to elicit the effect of pure terror on the audience to a complete and total sensory immersion to the images on screen using the latest in cinematic technology. The lights of which we can have revealed here in fear of government confiscation. The following visuals printed on this very film stock are proven to cause a highly visceral, biological response in the human nervous system in the most, hm, nefarious of ways. Oh, hello, doctor. As you can see from our scientific results, this photo realistic rendering of one, the human body, each and every frame of Deathication swiftly attacks the viewer's brainwaves, rendering specific motor functions helpless to the depravity that unfolds before your very eyes. At any moment during the course of this film, viewers have been know to suddenly and violently release their bowels! A collective explosion of hot, moist madness. In other words, what you're about to see will make you shit. A lot! Buckets of excrement! A river of ca ca will rage through this theater's as one buttery floor. You'll crap your slacks for days to come, ruin many undergarments become severely dehydrated, brave scorn at any social event or family gathering, even suffer from a case of inflamed anal tissue similar, to the effects of sodomy. In other other words, this film will rape you with your own feces. And that, my friends, is a Fernando Phagabeefy promise. With this warning in mind, by staying in this theatre, you're releasing any rights and liability against the film makers or the owner of this fine establishment for any cleaning bills, shattered senses, or exploded ovaries. So, for the safety of you, those around you and the integrity of your swimming trunks area, please consider this your final warning. Those in the audience who have a weak constitution or a giant asshole, should leave this theatre immediately! Unless you are truly prepared to experience the horrific effects of, Deathication. Because you can't scream if you're full of shit. [Fart sound] [disco music] [fart] [farting] [grunting] [farting] [groaning] [farting] [grunting] [fart] [disco music continues] [grunting] What the hell... [grunting over radio, audio problems] What is that? I don't know. That's a first. [disco music continues] Do you think Mr. K's all right? (Tobe) I don't know. I'm kind of worried about him. He seemed a bit a mess about the whole thing, and there was a gun. What? A gun? Look, I'll explain in a sec. Come on, let's go check him out. [shouting] [farting] [shouting] Cecil! Oh, my God. You kids, get out of here! What the hell, man? Gun. [growling] [loud thump] Dick, you're fired! [gunshot] [groaning] Boss! [loud thump] What? You never saw Robocop? What the cripes was that, Mr. K? I don't know. He just attacked me from behind. Next thing I know, he's trying to pull my pants down. I think he was trying to hide the baloney. (Mayna) What's that blue stuff on him? Wait, wait, wait. I saw that on somebody's shirt downstairs. Wait! Did he bite you? He's totally a zzombie. No. He came close but no cigar. I'm fine. And you? Actually, I'm kind of awesome, all things considering. (Mr. K.) Well, let's check the [indistinct] Look out! Tobe! [loud thump] [on screen audio problems] Get him off me! [growling] [suspenseful music] Tobe! Shit! He's trying to kiss me! Fuck you, Floyd. [gunshot] Wow. Wow. Wow. [gunshot] [groaning] Wolfman has nards! Nice shooting, Tex. How'd you know that was the sweet spot? (Mayna) Come on, I'm a girl. I know where guy's heads are. (Tobe) Thanks. That's two you owe me, Junior. God, I love you. I know. Will you two clam it 'till the credits? What I wanna know is what the sweet scent of Satan's scrotus is going on here. [cheerful music and screaming] [wet meat and creaming] [shouting] What?

Penis brat! You gotta be fucking kidding! [screaming] Swearsies. Now what? We get back in the car and get the fuck out. [growling] Plan A sucks. Got any other ideas? Follow me. [suspenseful music continues] Fuck you, fucking zzombies! [shouting] Okay. I gotta think. I gotta save the day. What would, uh, Simon Pegg do? That's too British. Des, Des, we're gonna get out of this. We're gonna be oh... [suspenseful music and wet meat] Des? [gasping] I want you, Ryan. That is so awesome, but, this is kind of a no time for love Dr. Jones situation here, so. We'll be fine. [moaning] Come to me, Ryan. But, but you're... In love? No... [moaning] Be inside me forever, Ryan. I, uh... Fuck it! [wet meat sound] [groaning] [spooky music] Phone's dead. (Mr. K.) Phones out here too, smart bastards. What the hell is going on? When there's no more room left in hell, "The dead shall fuck the earth." Or something like that, it's like, with the final reel. Final reel. What? No. I cannot die here tonight. You're not gonna die tonight. Here. Here you go, kid. Six rounds will give you some courage. (Mayna) What about you? Don't worry about me. Now you came by car tonight, right? Yeah, hopefully Ryan stayed in the car. He's got the keys. Get back to your car, lock yourselves in and drive fast. What do we tell him? That this in an undead orgy? Tell them whatever! Tell them to bring the cops, the army, the goddamn hazzmat suits. Bring them all! Now, you have 12 rounds between you. Got it. (Mayna) Aren't you coming? Yeah. Yeah. I'll... I'll catch up with ya. Scoot you two. Good luck. And may the schwartzz be with ya. You too, Mr. K. What was it you said, Orson? Nobody who takes on anything big and tough can afford to be modest. [background shouting and growling] [triumphant music] Fuck modesty. [suspenseful chord] Fuck! [soft growling] Hey, there, big boy. You like that? Is this what you want? (Tobe) Mayna, what the fuck? [distorted voice] Happy ending. [panting] [gunshot] [keys clinking] Feel important. Wait! Smoke screen. [groaning] (Mayna) Fuck me gently with the chain saw. [gunshot] [grunting] Let's go! Okay. Okay. Oh, my God! Where's the car? Right there. (Tobe) Yeah. Right there. [gunshots] (Mayna) Oh, shit. [growling] Fuck. [gunshot] (Tobe) Watch out. [Mayna] Your mother sucks cocks in hell. [gunshot] [shouting] Tobe! Oh, my gosh! [gunshot] [panting] Oh, fuck. (Mayna) Are you out? (Tobe) I've got one. [suspenseful music and walla] I've got two. Wait. No. I've only got one. Fuck. Well, the best we could do is use it on us. Before we become zzombies. I don't feel like losing my virginity with a goddamn zzombie. Wait. You're a virgin? Can we talk about this later? Watch it. [gunshot] I waited for you. [soft music] Now put the gun on my head and pull the trigger. The bullet should take us both out. What? Is that the best idea you've got? It's the only thing I can remember from the movies that makes any sense... [gunshot] [suspenseful music] Get your undead dicks out of my drive-in! [gunshot and shouting] Old turkey! (Mr. K.) This way, jerk offs! Follow me! (Mr. K.) Amscra you two. Get to the chopper. Go. (Mayna) Where are the keys? I don't know. You have them. What? No, I gave them to you. I gave them to you! Check your pockets. I got 'em! Behind you! [gunshot] In. In. In. Get in! Open the door! Unlock it. Get in. [closing door] "Hasta la vista, baby ." "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn". "Nobody puts Baby in a corner." [gunshot] "Yippie ki yay motherfucker." [gunshot] "What we have here is a failure to communicate". [Gunshot] [gunshots and shouting] "Goonies never say die!" [triumphant music continues] "I'm getting too old for this shit". (Mr. K.) This way, perverts! Follow the Pied Piper and his sweet asshole! [growling] Cinema is dead. [thump] [wet meat sound] Oh! "Say hello to my little friend!" [gunshot] [indistinct] a better contender! "Rosebud, motherfucker"! Oh, God. I think that was uncle Cecil's curtain call. Well, that's a way to find out. Huh? Keys to ignition. Go! (Tobe) Okay. [engine cranks but can't start] No, no, no. Come on. This isn't supposed to happen. We're supposed to survive. Fuck. This is it. Wait! You still have the... Fresh out. [cocks gun] Damn it! What do we do now? (Mayna) Well, we can just sit here and wait for them to turn us into human sex toys. Okay. Already not digging doing number one. Or, We spend the last night of our lives together and give these fuckers one hell of a show. I have to admit that's one hell of a plan. Let's do it. Wait. [soft music] Funny. Did you ever think this would be the moment you became a man? Actually, it was during an alien invasion but it really doesn't matter what the scenario. Why's that? Because I always knew it would be with you. You are so cool. True romance. Wait. Wait. What? What? Do you have a condom? Really? [chuckling] I'm kidding. [zzombies thumping and groaning] [suspenseful music and glass shattering] [cheering] Fantastic! Now that's an ending. Fuck Hollywood! Really? Boring. Boring? Not enough tits. Actually, it was kinda bittersweet. You know? Like the ending of E.T. Why does everything gotta be E.T. with you? Come on. Let's go. E.T.'s gay. How... He's a plant. He can't be gay. He's a pla... He's a plant. Would you be gay if you were a plant? [lively music] [screaming] [hard rock music] It is a biological anomaly the likes of which the medical community has never seen. Miles' unique body chemistry clashed with the Plutoneide and the Spermupermine mutating his spermatozzoa during spermatogenesis in a way that no one could've expected. Spermatium are by their very nature a very determined and resilient organism genetically programmed to overcome all obstacles defy all odds and hit the target. Or die trying. Perhaps... You can view this disaster as a kind of cautionary tale against the misuse of a yet to be fully understood era in atomic energy. God help us all. [soft cheerful song] [soft music] [pop song] Ba-bye.
