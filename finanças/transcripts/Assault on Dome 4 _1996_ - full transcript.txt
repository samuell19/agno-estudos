Wyndham but there are peacekeepers here who will take you into custody soon enough indeed Lily there are precisely five peacekeepers and this entire dome oh excuse me four and speaking of which would you be so kind as to take us to your local sheriff why didn't you report to earth that standard procedure with what he had control of everything we didn't have to get involved you could have waited I was unarmed he had already killed at least one peacekeeper so instead of laying low you decided to throw a wrench into the works he had a gun at my wife's head if it had been your wife what would you have done I would have followed standard operating procedure well maybe that's why you wear a suit and I wear a badge our concern is the liberties you take with that badge I had to do something Alex Wyndham had just broken out of a maximum-security prison and already he - was making a move on dome for it wasn't - about to just sit there and do nothing Hi there are you the senior security officer splendid vini vidi vici Julius Caesar my friend we Came we saw we conquered shortly after that satellite transmission all communications with dome before will cut off I likes Windham the Greenway robbery South Dakota in 89 Neptune Center bombing yeah he's had quite a career you know we actually put him away for a while but as you can tell from that stunt that he pulled on Mars no prison can hold him he's once in the crew and now he's made the leap to interplanetary terrorists so it would seem we know what he wants no yeah call a meeting of the Security Council and have your staff review any and all calls to and from Dome for in the last 72 hours yes sir damn sir keep an airtight lid on this all right if they can't help I want them out of the loop yes sir thank you chase Moran a peacekeeper well I was enjoying a little peace here before you come crashing through the wall like some kind of a damned idiot take it easy listen there's something going on here something bad and I can't do [ __ ] about it until I find my way around this place what I need from you is a map or a blueprint or something I always wanted one of those yeah you do it's yours yeah well just give me a map what's your name old-timer they call me mellow I don't know what's going on my advice to you is this day but that's what I do best sunny that's what I do best you better be on the up and up oh yeah good evening my name is Alex Wyndham and I'm your new chief operating officer get him out of here my associates have sequestered your modest peacekeeping personnel and have severed all communications with Mother Earth so it's just but don't be alarmed ooh you have nothing to fear as long as you cooperate now in the morning you'll all receive instructions and work orders and until that time I'd say enjoy your dinner have a pleasant restful evening and remember two basic things do not go near those trip wires or you will be blown up and do not question my authority for it is supreme this is post one the command I'm in lower level sector five copy that quake that's very good you do requests hands in the air nice and slow who the [ __ ] are you man it's just a cop on the beat [ __ ] what makes you think I'm an [ __ ] got that out of your system good now what's Alex Windham doing here out of the first date sweetheart the first guy took out how to communicate but he also had a bag full of explosives Windham had Tripp wired half the dome already and if I had let him finish his job getting around would have been impossible when did you finally make contact with earth soon as I could the guys were using an odd frequency so with a little work I managed to tap into a open channel and make the call oh I guess you better add tampering with enemy property to your list very amusing officer Moran yes yeah put him through hey chase what's up listen I can't really talk now there's some stuff going on here yeah oh Christ chase but how Christ I came up to surprise her for her birthday she doesn't even know I'm here look does Wyndham know that you're their frequency speaking of which let's keep this short what I know so far is he's got about 10 guys with him less than one I've already taken out and let me tell you from the stash this guy had in his kick alone I think Windham is packing some heavy-duty fire listen chase we don't know yet exactly what Windham is up to but I am certain that he will contact us very soon until that happens the very best thing that you can do is to sit tight chase you listening to me Cole gems rare minerals magnesium plutonium titanium are you suggesting he wants to build some kind of bomb I wouldn't put it past all right I will fill in the chairman but for right now I don't want you any more involved than you already are I have to find lily no if you try to get to lily now you'll only be putting her in greater danger listen I am telling you this not as your friend but as chief of staff to the chairman of the United government you lay low and that's an order give them at a title anything so you can start pushing everybody around I'll talk to you later you stay safe chase you have a visitor what the hell do you want shut up oh you'll have to forgive quit Lilly he's not exactly a wellspring of social grace but he's loyal to a fault thanks clay we'll be fine the first thing I want you to know is I'm not gonna force myself on you Lilly I know you don't understand what I'm doing here I'm doomed for but the work my associates and I are doing is groundbreaking revolutionary you can't imagine the amount of self-discipline I am exercising right now if I had but one wish it would be for you to shed this gown and give yourself to me get out of my room oh we're playing hard to get I promise you Lilly once you've had me you'll never want a decent man ever again oh we're dancing yes you know my father died dancing at the end of a rope hmm your neck tastes like loganberry I do hope you have a really really good explanation we were taking the residents back to the quarters after dinner this one broke free took off wasn't armed in order let's not shoot them you now have my permission to shoot any and all resistors finally locked up this is Alex your boss listen up and listen good you find those explosives do you find that runaway peacekeeper because if things get unpleasant for me they are going to become extremely unpleasant for those around me and let us not forget who bailed who out of what prison you understand you'll have to forgive me I'm no longer in the mood they said he has a communicator right hello this is Alex Windham only a few people can hear me right now my men and the pesky little bastard who killed Leon following message it's worth a little bit I just want you to know whoever you are that you are messing with the wrong guy you're in way over your head you're outnumbered physically and you are most certainly outmatched intellectually all right so my advice to you is sir if you'd like to avoid a slow and agonizing death is to turn yourself in oh and I'd like my explosives back too please thank you that is all I would be glad to I really think you'll give yourself up no but what can you do when your explosives back in Alex welcome to my party [ __ ] just calling to let you know that I've decided to take your advice into account and I'm giving you your explosives back I guess he's not giving himself up so easy boy - quite a risk playing cat and mouse with windin it was a calculated risk could have lost his temper he could have started executing hostages just to spite you yes but he didn't instead what happened is that some of his explosives were taken out of commission his position of authority was weakened and had put him on edge and I defy you to find one military strategist who consider that a bad thing we're not here to discuss military theory exactly I had a real situation on my hands and I decided to level the playing field just a little bit unfortunately the game was still far from over the formulas here should be self-explanatory you have plenty of materials to get started and your associates will be mining plutonium and a cranium as needed now you'll be working longer hours than you used to but you will reap tremendous benefits from knowing that this is all being done in the name of a new world a tremendous new world now Sigmund here will be supervising you all very closely so if you have any questions feel free to ask questions Lily then let's get started I don't understand the potency of these elements has been tested before well we're using the conventional manner yes what do you mean he's discovered a new use for plutonium a cranium let's put it this way Alex has blown the lid off of chemical warfare hello mr. chairman good morning to you what have I been up to you're probably wondering well we hit a few bumps in the road last night but basically I'm satisfied as you know I have some of the scientific community's most brilliant minds working for me and at the rate we're going with the materials we have access to it won't be long until we've amassed enough military might to basically level all about five continents why would you want to do that well I don't here's the big picture Earth has recently started colonizing in space and the good news is it works you've managed to stabilize atmospheres and extract natural resources etc etc and the bad news you're in my way - chairman specifically I'm referring to - stellen nine now look you and I both Know that there's life on this planet and it's similar to ours but just a little less evolved which is very attractive to me you see because to them I would be a god all-knowing all-powerful as feared and respected as the Creator himself and of course like any good dictator I'll simply keep the rest of the world at bay with the threat of a bomb so here's the deal you can keep the rest of the universe but I wants telling ninth to address this on a purely hypothetical level stellar nine to flourish as a planet has to be nurtured not just ruled by an iron fist in addition the number of inhabitants is still relatively low which is critical to earth with that problem of overpopulation and that sir is the operative word your problem you see I want Stella nine so either you give it to me or I'll take it that's all they felt like I'll have a staff meeting or something I'll have Dan block come see me right away okay chase think hard alex is right you're outnumbered but if we can get to the peacekeepers and get some weapons from security might even out the odds a little bit Lily sweetheart this isn't how I wanted to spend your birthday dan I've spoken to general Scott he thinks we should dispatch an Android command he feels of all goes well we could lose less than 25 percent of the residents boss if you send a team blasting in there and all does not go well we could lose all of them you know from what chase tells me Windham is only got about ten men but he does have a ton of firepower I say if we go in at all we go in quietly well how do you propose we do that let me go alone that's crazy chairman Windham is a pro if you send an entire squad up there he'll blast him out of the sky before they even get within docking distance I know a way that I can slip in there dan I know chase is a friend of yours and you taught him everything he knows but you haven't been on a special ops in over ten years I can't risk sending you in there mr. chairman with all due respect it is not your risk it's my risk and I will take full responsibility besides once a commando always a commando maybe you're right well it's your ass soldier good luck thank you sir hey easy stallion a moose yeah you you think maybe you could loosen up my restraints a bit are you ready to tell me about that [ __ ] buddy of yours what are you hard of hearing we tell you already we don't know who the guy is or where he came from come on my blood flow is getting cut off you think I give a rat's ass about your blood flow yeah shut off before starts coming out of your ass we'll see as my lighter hello ladies I'll be back in a second so just sit tight no going away you breakfast what makes you so [ __ ] quick runner fire I need backup hey watch the birdie give me the rifle aren't you coming with us we'll hold all of us go on I'll catch up with you later hello boys end of the line what's the story good news or bad news but for peacekeepers are dead three of our men cold Jenks Purcell are dead too and what about our little friend he's still unaccounted for that was the wrong answer but took off down the stairwell and and with three of our men dead and me trying to go ahead wait please please stop stop don't make excuses it's very unbecoming just squash the little bugs so I can have some peace of mind okay damn what the hell is this post five the command over yeah it looks like a shuttle zero nine zero nine is requesting permission for a food supply drop what the [ __ ] you want me to do perfect haven't got a communicator these links are a mess and not gonna be talking to dad anytime soon drop it where's Alex answer me it's not gonna get any better all right the next one is for real now you got to ask yourself a question are you so loyal to Alex you're willing to sit here for an hour with a river of blood flowing out of your balls okay no that's better you're a good man I had to let you reach for it I'm in time for successful test this is dan to earth command one come in over oh he'll have to call you back oh you're gonna pay for this you have any idea how much this shirt cost hello mr. chairman can you hear me I'm here well things have gotten a little livelier since we last oh yeah and evidently you didn't take my proposal quite as seriously as I'd hope so uh you forced me to up the ante Wow very impressive isn't it it's a prototype for the bombs I'm building here on dome floor thank you now I brought this one from home but well frankly I'd hate to part with it what's the point my point is this tough guy you have exactly three hours to finalize the formal agreement forfeiting all your claims to Stella 9 or all I don't know blow up the Eastern continent or something oh and mr. chairman did you know that I have a mouse in my house his name is chase but fortunately we've got some bait thank you hello Dan hello chase this is Alex again listen um you know you just can't win it's that simple now the peacekeepers they found out just a little bit too late and well they're all dead now I got this fellow here named Dan block sitting here at the receiving end of my job now being here claims that he doesn't know you and that his life is meaningless to you but I don't know chase I mean I doubt any life is meaningless to you and when you think about it now why would Dan go through so much trouble in your life meant nothing to him anyway here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna count to five and then if by that point you don't a identify your location and B surrender I will shoot Dan okay here we go one two you better kill me anyway Oh hold incidentally chase there are these emergency alert boxes pretty much everywhere just activate one we'll come pick you up and nobody has to get hurt let's see where wasn't it yeah oh yes three that would be four burner five you son-of-a-bitch my heart bleeds for you mr. chairman listen up you got three hours and then the real show begins officer Moran dan block was the chief of staff of the United government I know it was my friend and as your friend he went in there to help you was there nothing you could have done to help him he ordered me not to comply with Windom demands that was the one order that you chose to follow if Ida surrendered when des would have killed us both dan knew that he knew the risks going in there if you think he did it just for me just do the man a great disservice Dan wounded Windom he took out Quaid and that is when the tide began to turn your work is exceptional but we need these elements compounded much faster Thanks what happened to you already the vital organs are intact but Quaid is good that leaves just five of us and our little friend is still on the loose so please tell me we're getting close oh yeah well we are making incredible progress here there's there's still oh are you little ways to go the scientists they're exhausted exhausted folks I know you're tired I know this is hard and I'm sure you're still grappling with the moral ambiguity surrounding your work but that's too [ __ ] bad because I am in charge here and no government and no commando and no pain-in-the-ass hop will ever ever change that let's just go get everybody some more coffee make money decaf I'm feeling a little edgy three hours is a ridiculous deadline the whole situation is ridiculous even if we comply what's to stop him from launching that bomb or holding it over our head the next time he needs something and you're suggesting what course of action we blow the dole we'll lose 40 or so innocent men or women but at least the madness will end there well he can't stand on for forever why don't we make the deal and then when there's an opening we can make our move because he's got a bomb that can wipe out millions of people we have to contain the situation now despite the obvious cost it's what we got to do chairman agreed I suggest given the urgency of the situation we set a launch time for 60 minutes from now is that acceptable chairman yes you know Lily that's I can't help it yeah find something to do I know I should be thinking about conquering the final frontier and realizing my potential as an omnipotent astral force but well all I can think about is you speaking of the final frontier what exactly do you intend to do with that planet well you know I'm an artist and the galaxy is my canvas in order to complete my vision I need workers obedient workers so well really Stella 9 is perfect for someone like me oh you mean someone who's cowardly and pathetic you know that Lee soon our research here will be done then my friends and I will be moving on to another world my world and I desperately need someone to share it all with sounds intriguing really but I'm married and where is this husband of yours does he live here on the dome no well there's hope yeah really oh you are so beautiful it brings to mind those immortal words of Shakespeare when he said a thing of beauty is a joy forever that was Keith's Shakespeare never said that well maybe he should have we'll go after him Samantha post six this is post six look good that Boonen was just down here in the lab Rob just went after him sent Kaiser for backup and check those trip wires real make sure they're still intact your copy right now I have half a mind to just blow this whole stinking dong it could happen what is this a staring contest get back to work where is it I don't know I lost him do you want a medal found this keep looking wow wow wow my what a handsome couple all right what the hell is going on nothing don't patronize me all right now you've got about one second to explain so he's my husband so what I had no idea he was here he's a peacekeeper on earth don't tell me he came here to save you lily I mean I'm a romantic but I can't compete with that can't you just leave us alone well I must admit you weren't in a position to actually help him no Lily I'm afraid it's too late for that Oh what kind of cruel joke is this that the woman I find most desirable is married to the man I would most loved to kill mmm oh the humanities Oh Jase this is Alex listen I gotta tell you between you and your dead friend and you pretty much wore me out I mean hell out fortunately I don't have to worry about you anymore because I had your wife say hello honey how do we get the idea all right you listen to me you ballsy little bastard do you ever want to see Lily again alive that is you will find yourself a hole and crawl into it because if you so much as even breathe in the direction of me or my men I will cut your dear wife open and eat her heart out with a spoon I was exhausted the lives of my wife and 40 other people were hanging in the balance and though I didn't know it at the time my own government had decided to blow us all the smithereens in order to cut their losses yeah you could say I was in quite a spot what happened next Wyndham had what he wanted as soon as his hostages had created the elements that he needed he could take off destroying dome four on the way out all right people you're no longer needed here so let's move out +6 to command over what finally some good news yeah what else I returned the scientists to their quarters and secured the area all of the residents are accounted for and in their quarters as well lovely well it sounds like we're back on track all right stay tuned now all Sigmund has to do is armed the bomb we can set a course for stellar - nine and then we'll blow this joint - don't go away Mmm I wish you were here to see this office of the chairman how can I help you
