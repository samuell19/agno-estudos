I can't believe this is happening. I wish I could see his face just one last time. I hope you're in a better place, my friend. How you holding up, Jake? I'm just great, Mike. Aren't we all just fucking great? I feel so much better now that you guys are here. What's his problem? Let it go, Mike. We're here to pay respect, remember? Where's Adam's family? His mom found him. I doubt she'll be going anywhere for a while. What about his dad? South America, South Africa. I can never remember which. I don't think he's got a dad. I think he was making it all up. You all right? I guess we're the closest thing he has to family here. Christ. How many times do you have to tell a guy? It's just a stupid game. We were all addicted to Hellworld, man. He's right, Mike. We should've seen this coming. But we didn't. We didn't do a damn thing. We have to live with that now. Jake. Jake. No! Let go! Let go! No! No! What's up, Mike? What? I paid 100 bucks for this thing on the Internet. Didn't it scare you at all? Mike, Cenobites don't exist. And even if they did, I never opened the Lamont Configuration. Which, as we know, isn't really real anyway. You talk the talk pretty good for someone who's not really into it anymore. What are you doing? Something amazing, Chelse. My curiosity's killing me. Funny you should ask. The box. You opened it. We came. "Dare to enter hell?" Now your soul belongs to me. "You've just been invited to the fifth annual secret Hellworld party. Be at the Leviathan House. " Leviathan House? Mike, I'm over it. We've been through this before. What? So now you're above it all? You can count me out. - I have some sights to show you. - We will. Please. You may want to spend quality time with the "Hellraiser" geek brigade. But Derrick and Allison would never waste a perfectly good Friday night in Hellworld. The Wall Walker's right behind you. I know the Wall Walker is right behind me. There you go. Easy, there, kiddo. Now go through the door. I can't believe it! The box! Come on. Open it. - I'm trying. I'm trying. - No. Allison, you're all herky-jerky. Come here. You got to finesse it. Derrick. Time to play. What's your pleasure? Holy sugar. We did it! I'm going to a real, live secret Hellworld party! But what about me? - No guests. - Welcome to hell. That's not very fun, is it? Now move aside. I can get my own invite. Come to Papa. I'll tear your soul apart. Don't tell me you're going to Hellworld. Allison, please. We aren't kids anymore. Sure you don't want to check this out? Hang on, Allison. Good night, Mike. I have all eternity to know your flesh. - Good night, Mike. - Come on, Chelse. - For old times' sake? - Good night, Mike. - Website shuts down at midnight. - I'll call. - Little kiss? - Good night. Sorry. So what if I'm still into Hellworld? It's only a party, sweetheart. That's not the point. Look, I do find myself bored and playing it now and again. But this is like "Space Voyage" convention crap. There is a major difference between Space Voyagers and Hellraisers. Hellraisers know how to party. Reality check. We should've grown out of this by now. Reality check. We're going. Are you gonna come or not? Hey, good-lookin'. About freaking time, boys. Look at you, sexy. You like this? Let me tell you something. You want to come back here? Come on, Allison. At least let me sit up there. That's gonna leave a bruise. I know. Leg cramp. Derrick, you're kicking me! Anybody need a lift? So, what made you change your mind? I just wanted to keep you all out of trouble. You've been away from the Dark Realm awhile. How'd it feel playing again? Just like any other ultraviolent, 24-hour, wildly popular yet utterly purposeless, embraced-by-the-masses, Internet role-playing game. All right, Pinhead Junior. ¤ Sooner or later it ends ¤ ¤ Later the sooner you realize ¤ ¤ Is there anybody left to catch you when you fall? ¤ ¤ What will you do to pretend? ¤ Hellraisers, let's play! A little something from the Norman Bates School of Design. This is such a perfect place for a Hellworld party! Let's go. Let's go raise some hell. Adam would've loved this. Hang on. Chelse, are you coming or what? She's coming. Come on. Mike, put me down! My God. Look at this. I like this. This is so rad! This is gonna kick "A"! I've died and gone to hell! Gratuitous tit shot. Necessary tit shot. Come along, boys. Don't be antisocial. Now, that's what I call a buzz kill. Didn't expect to see you here. What the hell is he doing here? I haven't seen him since the funeral. Who has? I'm not surprised to see him here. He got us started in all this crap. Even Adam. Jake blames us for Adam's death. I blame us for Adam's death. Come on, guys. It's just a game. A crazy fucking Internet game. It's one thing to play it, another to live it. What Adam did was his decision. End of story. We're here to have fun, right? Right? Jake! Come on over and join the party. So, what have you been up to, Jake? Trying to forget the past. Welcome, Hellraisers. I take it this is your first time at a Hellworld party. Invitations. Outstanding. May I offer you a drink? Make yourselves at home. I have a feeling you're going to be here for a while. I'm your host for the festivities tonight and perhaps the ultimate Hellworld fanatic. Look at this stuff. You see this? It's like a "Hellraiser" museum. I don't think you'll find a greater collection anywhere. Who's the pretty kitty? You're the pretty kitty. Yes, you are. Hey, guys. Five bucks, see your future? This is where the shit hits the fan, guys. Did you see this? Mr. LeMarchand himself! I wear Eau de Cenobite. That stuff stings. - Derrick! - What? May I offer you a drink? It's from my family's private stock. A little ritual for newcomers only. Here you go. Guys? No. I don't drink. I'm driving. Come on. Let's not insult the dude. No insult taken. Bottoms up. Knock yourselves out. Holy cow. That is amazing. Yes. It's made out of human skin. There's no texture quite like it. This place is all skin and bones. I love it. I see you all have a fondness for the macabre. There's more where this came from. I'd like to show it to you. I'm an authority on Leviathan House, Philip LeMarchand's second greatest architectural achievement. I assume you already know his first greatest. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here tonight. I'm getting goose bumps. Like most great artists of his time, LeMarchand found himself commissioned by the Church to build a convent. And for decades, LeMarchand's palace stood as such. Then came the convent's final mother superior, Sister Ursala. A nun whose vows were shattered by an obsession for a tiny puzzle box and the unholy pleasures sealed inside it. ¤ Holy pussy ¤ Hey, Derrick! Man, you got to listen to this. Sometime during the blizzard of 1809, some 80 women vanished from this house without a trace. Ursala was the only one they found. Only she wasn't all there. You might say she went to pieces. But... Years later, the house was renovated and became a lockup for the criminally insane. From nuns to nuts. That is, until the staff began reporting occurrences of paranormal violence. So the house is haunted. That's what I'm talkin' about! This is awesome. One cold spring morning, the team locked themselves in this surgical amphitheater, injected themselves with a local anesthetic, and dismembered one another. So the house is haunted. I think tonight will bring you many answers. Very nice. I wouldn't touch that if I were you. Often the butchery of human flesh was so monumental, they used these devices to discard the excess. You mean they chucked human beings out with this? No. Bodies. Forget goose bumps. My you-know-whats are getting hard. So, who owns the house today? You do. Now, that's just wrong. What the fuck? Are you all right, Derrick? Ew. So, Jake, are you here with some new friends? It's a friend. A girl? You sound surprised. No, I'm not surprised at all. Look. This isn't a reunion? I never was one of you guys, and I never will be. Same old Jake. Chelsea. Have a good time tonight. You still look woefully underwhelmed. Whatever. Have a high tolerance, do you? The props are cool, but this is just an old house. LeMarchand is a character from some scary story, the puzzle box a myth, and Hellworld is just a game. Thirsting for something more? Something I believe. How about pain? Adam was right. Chelsea? Are you okay? Chelsea? Hey, take it easy. You all right? You stay away from me. I'll try to contain myself. Everybody just calm down. Is everything cool, Chelsea? She hasn't even started drinking yet. I think I need some air. I need a drink. Hell seekers, this is your house tonight. Now, that's what I'm talkin' about. What's with the masks, anyway? Everybody gets a mask and a cellphone. Each mask has a four-digit number on it. If you wish to engage in the pleasures that only flesh can bring, you pick a tasty morsel and dial that number. Sweet. Anonymous debauchery. I like this already. God. A day in the life of you guys. Does nothing ever change? Much as I love watching old wounds being opened, I do have other guests. But if you need anything, just scream. So, Jake, still haven't found your date? For your information, I met her on-line. So you don't even know what she looks like. What kind of chat-room-challenged moron do you think I am? That's why I'm here. This ought to be fun. Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now? Three shots over here. Lot of talent here. What? A lot of... A lot of talent here tonight. Go get some. You know, as in, you should go get some. Good luck. You're gonna need it. Don't you have anything better to do? I'm enjoying myself, Jake. I'm not hurting anybody. The only way you guys ever enjoy yourselves is when you're hurting somebody. You never change, do you? I told my date about you guys. Don't be surprised if she's not exactly friendly. You are not guilting me into having a crummy time tonight. We didn't earn your hatred, Jake. None of us earned it. You guys don't earn anything. You just take it. It then became a lockup for the criminally insane. I'm a bit of an authority on Leviathan House. God damn, y'all are fine. Excuse me. I'll be right back. I'm not Mr. Right, but I'm Mr. Right Now. Goody. These things actually work. Thanks, Derrick. What the... Ladies? Damn it, Allison! So, here we are again. Just the two of us. Just the two of us. I see. So, how long has it been now? Two years? You're still holding a torch for a guy who you're never gonna get a second chance with. He's dead, Chelse. Move on. You know what, Mike? Have a great time tonight. Go fuck somebody. But when you sober up, I expect an apology. Well, that went well. Hey, baby. You know what would look good on you? Me. Enjoy the party. Asshole. Bye. As if. How's it hangin'? Don't answer that. Kids, don't try this at home. The sacrificer is quite becoming on you, Allison. Get this thing off me. It's been used to drain the blood of Hellworld explorers since Leviathan himself first spoke the realm into being. There is no faster way to bleed a human without decapitating him. Please get this thing off me now. Relax. Relax. It's perfectly safe. Unless the cutting blades are engaged. The cutting blades are engaged. Someone. No! No! Please don't leave me! No! No! Chelsea! Do you believe Adam now, Allison? Adam? What the hell? Open up! Let me out! Shit. ¤ You realize what you have done ¤ Adam. "It's just a game"? You're a bright one, aren't you, kid? Not like the others. Where'd you get this? How do you know Adam? Adam was a very talented player. In fact, he was so passionate about Hellworld... ...that he made this with his own hands. Go ahead. Open it. It's not real. It's... Is it just a game now, Jake? I'd love to see your puzzle box. Want to dance? Want to party? Hey, how you doing? Can I have a drink, please? Sir, I'll take a drink. Some party, huh? Thanks. Fucking asshole. Anyone see this? Jake. How you doing? Listen. I was just wondering what... So sorry about that. Hey, how you doing? When'd you get into Hellworld? What's going on? What's going on here? Guys. What the fuck, man? Guys? Is everybody ignoring me? Is this a joke? Is this a big fucking joke? Fuck this. What a great party. Yes. No! No! Can't disappoint my fans. Hey, baby. What's your name? Mike, it's Chelsea. Listen. I am locked inside a room on the second floor, and I need you to come up and help me. So now you want me? Mike, look, I'm not messing around here. There's something really strange going on in this house. Well, maybe you shouldn't have blown me off. Please. Would you please come up and help me? I'm serious! I need your help! What's wrong with you, Mike? Mike? Great. What's the matter? - Allison, thank God. - Chelsea! Help me! Chelse! Allison, if you and Mike are fucking with me, so help me, God. Chelsea, help me! And I thought you had a high threshold. Don't worry about Allison. You'll see her again. Sooner than you think. Welcome to Hellworld, Chelsea. ¤ Welcome ¤ ¤ To hell ¤ 911. What's your emergency? I need help. I'm at 86 Hillbound Drive. Are you there? I can't hear you. Hello? Can I help you, fellas? Hey, there. Sorry to bother you at this hour. It's all right. I think. We just got a call. Probably a prank. Young woman says her friends are being taken hostage or something. I'm entertaining some guests here tonight. She sounded whacked out of her gourd. Do you mind if we look around? I'd rather you didn't. Scare away my guests. Up here! I have a reputation to uphold. I don't want some drugged-out chick tarnishing it. Up here! Officer, I have Ms. Murdoch on the line. This is Officer Riley. I'm at the big house now. Where are you? I'm upstairs by the window, just above the veranda. I'm looking up at the window right now. I don't see a damn thing. What the fuck are you talking about? I'm right here! Look! Definitely drugs. Probably speed or meth. Come back! Up here! Look! I'm rerouting you back to Dispatch. I don't believe this. Dispatch. This is Officer Riley. Did the trace come up with anything? The call came from your number. No shit. Somebody's pulling your leg. They're always one step ahead. Okay, guys. We're going home. Prank call. Apparently she was calling me from my phone. These kids and their gadgets. I don't want to sound nosy. But what's a guy like you do with a big house like this, anyhow? I love to party. I believe you owe me one. Come on, stud. It's your turn to go down. Up here! Up! Look up! Up here! That's gonna bruise. Easy, sweet cheeks. You're gonna bruise my tonsils. That's not cool. Open up. Get in here. Come on. Open up. This is not fair. Where are you going? Don't leave me in here! Fuck. Props. Just props. Damn good props. Just... props. Of course. Latex. Even put it in Derrick's clothes. Nice touch. Derrick? Anybody? Somebody. Sweet cheeks? Not good. Please! No! This is just the beginning. Wait! Over here! Come back! No! Wait! Come on! Please. Like a bad horror movie, isn't it? Come on, guys. It's just a game. A crazy fucking Internet game. Adam was a very talented player. None of us could've seen him taking the game as far as he did. What Adam did was his decision. We should've seen this coming. Not real! Easy, now! Hold on. Everything's fine. Easy, easy, easy. I'm a cop. Easy, now. Are you the girl who called for help? What's your name? Chelsea. What the hell are you doing out here? There's something strange happening in that house. Something terrible happened to my friends. You've got to believe me. I believe you, Chelsea. This isn't the first time I've had to come out here. There's something about that house. Hang on. Dispatch, this is Unit 12. Dispatch. What's your situation? I'm at the old house. You still don't understand, do you? There is no way out for you, Chelsea. What wonders we have to show you. Chelsea, it's Jake! Chelsea, it's coming. Don't leave me here, Chelsea. Don't leave me here! I'm at the house, Chelsea. Chelsea, please! - Jake, hold on. - My God! Don't leave me here! My God, no. They're coming. Please don't leave me here. Jake, hold on! Where are you? Are you okay? What happened? No. I'm fine. I'm fine. What are you talking about? There's something majorly wrong going on here. No shit. Where is everybody? I haven't seen anyone. Have you? No. Nobody. And I mean nobody. It's this house, Jake. It's like it's playing with us. It's haunting us. Not if I can help it. That better be you, Mike. Not this time, Chelse. Great party. Welcome to motherfucking Hellworld, Chelsea. Get away from me! Come on, Chelse. Let's raise some hell. Leave me alone! Adam was right, Chelse. No! Come on, Chelse! It's what we've always wanted. You want me, Chelse. You know you want me. Game over, Chelsea! Only you and Jake left. Hello, Chelsea. I hope this night is everything you dreamed it could be. How obviously cryptic that was. Why don't I just call you Pinhead? If that's what you want to think. So you are Pinhead, right? Let me guess. You're going to rip off your face and morph into some franchise icon, right? You don't know Hellworld from your ass. How come you're in it? Get your mythology right, buddy. First, I have to open the box. Then, Pinhead appears. The hooks and chains. But none of that's happened. Why? Because none of it's real. You'll come to believe it, Chelsea. I'll say this much. It is about a box. "Come to the party. Come to the party. " No! I'm sorry. Why? I didn't know. I'm sorry. Please don't die. What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is this? Calm down! It's just me, Chelsea. What happened? I just killed you. You just died in my arms. Can I ask you a stupid question? Could this place be a portal? I mean to the real Hellworld. Somebody wants us to believe that. That's for sure. I'm not buying it. I mean, where's the engineers? Where are the jailers? Now, Pinhead is just supposed to show up and take your soul away. That's it. It's not adding up. Maybe we're already dead. No, Chelsea. Nobody opened up the box. Suppose it has nothing to do with the box, Jake. Suppose we're in hell because we belong here. For what? For not saving Adam. From who? From himself. From Hellworld. Chelsea, none of us thought he would take it that far. We knew what Hellworld was doing to Adam. But we kept on playing it. That was nobody's fault. If this is hell, none of us belong in it. Well, I'm starting to think we may not make it out, Jake. At the rate we're going, we might not make it long enough to see the sun rise. Chelse, when we get out of this place, I promise you the most beautiful sunrise ever. You're on, Jake. Where are you? I locked myself in the attic. You don't even want to know why. Sit tight. I'm on my way. It's from my family's private stock. Come on. Let's not insult the dude. No insult taken. Knock yourselves out. Welcome, Hellraisers. Invitations. Come here, Chelsea. Come here. It's just a game, Chelsea. No! Jake, he's got me! Whatever it is, don't believe it. It's not real! It's all in your head! It's whatever you're afraid of! Don't be afraid! He's not letting go! You have to believe me! It's not happening! Chelsea, it's not real! It's okay. Listen, Chelsea. This whole Hellworld thing has been one big trap. We've been brought here for some reason. I don't know why, but... It's Adam's dad. What? No. It can't be. It's Adam's dad, Jake. It can't be. No, it is. Do you want to stick around for any more surprises? Let's go! Leaving so soon, without even saying goodbye? Goodbye. Asshole. Damn! Go, Chelse. Let's get out of here! Let's go! Move! Let's go! Go! No. This way. What is it, Jake? What is it? It's us. You ought to pat yourself on the back, Jake. Everything worked out just like you said it would. No. I had nothing to do with this. I got to give credit where credit's due. The rest of them, I knew, would respond to a private-party invitation. But you I wasn't sure about. No. I had to lure you out. And I found you, Jake, on the Internet. In the Hellworld chat room. You did it all for me. The things a young man will tell a prospective lover. The myth of LeMarchand. The puzzle box. Hellworld. How the game itself would be the perfect weapon to do everybody in. I take my hat off to you. I couldn't have done it without you, Jake. You couldn't have done this. Yes, I could. Call it poetic justice for the people that buried my son. You sick son of a bitch! You were never even there for your own son! Your son spent his life waiting for a father who never came home! You didn't even go to his fucking funeral! That kid took 16 years of loneliness to his grave. And now you want to come back and get revenge on us? We were the only family Adam ever had. You still think you have a fighting chance, don't you? Get me out! Let me out! Can you hear me? Chelsea! Let me out! Let me out! I can practically smell the terror coursing through your veins. Why? Why did you do this? Revenge. You and your friends were right all along. Hellworld never really even existed. It was in your mind the whole time. Don't! Even this very moment. You believe me now, don't you? You and your friends have been six feet under since this began. Sodium amytal is a drug that induces a highly impressionable, trancelike euphoria. It can be taken in every which way you can imagine. No! You can inhale it. You can touch it. - Ingest it. - No! Please. You and your friend Jake were reluctant to sample my free gifts. Fuck! I had to take you by force. Once you were drugged, you were under my spell. I buried you. Each in separate coffins with cellphone at hand. With ventilation so you wouldn't run out of air and miss out on all that sweet suffering. It was through these cellphones I could communicate subliminal suggestions. Your own fertile imaginations did the rest. There were freak-outs, confessions, negotiations, orgasms, surrenders. Your own guilt-ridden conscience even threw Adam in there. Chelsea. What a pleasant surprise that was. It was all so exhausting. I barely had enough energy to go back and enjoy myself at the party. I figured, "Why not? Why not enjoy myself?" There were a few unexpected casualties along the way. Allison severely gouged herself trying to claw off her imaginary neck device and then bled to death. Derrick's asthma took him out. And Mike? He died of good old-fashioned drop-dead fear. You know what makes my revenge so sweet? I beat you guys at your own game. We loved him. We didn't deserve this. Tell him that when you see him. Your dream's over, Chelsea. No! Your nightmare is just about to begin. See you in hell. Goodbye, Chelsea. Come on, guys. You're all right. Let go of me! - Get off! - You're okay. - It's all right. - You're safe. - Get off me! - Let's go. You're safe. You're safe now. You're safe! You don't need to see. You don't need to see that. Come on. Jake, are you okay? Jake! What a party. We made it, Jake. We made it out. Guess I owe you that sunrise. You're very lucky, you know. We almost gave up on you. I don't understand. You've been missing for days. And somebody made a call a little while ago. We traced the call to this location. I'm sorry to say the house owner cleared out a few days ago. Covered his tracks pretty good, too. Don't worry. We'll catch him. He's gone? But then, how'd you find us? Who made the call? Traced the signal right to this very spot. Damndest thing. We'd have never have found you. Your cellphone was found up at the house. Maybe the owner made the call, but I doubt it. I don't get it. Welcome. Welcome to hell. This is not happening. Seeing is believing. I should've come for you a long time ago. Hellworld. There's no Hellworld. It doesn't exist. Your son was quite the prodigy. He opened the gateway to hell. But you never believed yourself, did you? Got to wake up. I got to wake up. I got to wake up. Wake up! How's that for a wake-up call? Chicago. No. No. It's too cold. Miami. Typical male.
