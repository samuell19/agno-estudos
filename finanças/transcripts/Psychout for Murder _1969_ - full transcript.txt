My dear and faithful friends, this new factory is yours. This factory was born thanks to you. Born with you and for you. This is a positive, real demonstration that we can keep our promises. I add: if we keep on planning our future together it'll be even better. I feel like Cinderella meeting her Prince Charming. Prince Charming was rich. I'm not... Yet. I don't care about money. You're more important to me. I love you. Imagine father's face if he could see me now. Making love on the inauguration day of his new factory. Police. This way. Quick. They'll catch us here. There's another way out. We'll clear off then. Hurry up. I can hush up the paper. It's a matter of money. Really? What about the other papers? They'll dig up all our shady affairs. They all know that I'm behind you. Maybe there's a way. Nobody would dare attack a man struck by misfortune. She behaved the way she did because she wasn't mentally stable at the time. If you could only prove that your daughter is sick... Prove that my daughter's insane? - Sick, my son. I know that a girl from such a decent family, with high principles, a girl who has been given such a perfect education... Only a sick girl would behave in this manner. It's exactly your duty as a father to use every possible means moral and material, to put her back on the path of righteousness. I'm not the first one to go to bed with a man. So, where's the harm? There would be no harm if you weren't Brignoli's daughter. - Rather, Brignoli, the industrialist. Wealth, power, must be preserved at any cost. If I have to pay such a high price, I don't want them any more. Then, give up. You can't go on with compromises. You've worked for this. You made your kingdom from nothing. It's fair for you to protect it. - So, to you, what was I supposed to do? To live like you, Giovanna? - I've already made my choice. And I'm happy with Francesco. - Of course. You've got Francesco. And then? What else have you got? Look around. Nothing here is yours. All that you see in this house belongs to papa Brignoli. I'm not asking you for help. I demand it. You can't say no after what I've done for you. You owe me that much. Isn't it a bit too much to sacrifice Licia for us? - Don't be stupid. This scandal must be stopped. Otherwise, it'd be the end of us. The end of the factory. That's all you talk about. Will it sink because of this scandal? Let it sink, then. Licia is more important. To you, it's just a word. To me, it's life. I don't want to lose it this way. I won't lose it. People don't pity those who've been fortunate. - And you? Do you perhaps feel pity for somebody? You don't even feel pity for yourself. I'm not your factory. You can't rule my life. I'm foolish enough to do that alone. Know what? I've decided: I'm going to live with you. What? My parents have really flipped over the scandal. They decided to pass me off as crazy. It can't be. It's absurd. They couldn't possibly do such a thing. That's what you think. They've already decided. Come on. They only want to help you. To send you to some place for a rest. Maybe you really need a rest. What're you talking about, Mario? - You know... All that uproar... might have upset you. I know you're here. Why so generous, father? We have to go. We've an appointment at the asylum. You're finally rich, Mario. How are you, Licia? - Fine. I'm glad. Here. I've brought you some flowers. They're beautiful. You like them? Yes. They are very beautiful. I'll come back to see you soon. And... I'll bring you more flowers. A lot of flowers? - Of course. Then, when you get out, we'll go on a trip together. A very long trip. A trip? Sure. We'll go far away and we'll never come back. She'll never be the same again. That silence inside her... Can't you stop thinking about Licia now? - I'm sorry. I can't help it. The same thing might happen to us. If only we had the courage to react. The courage... to rebel. I'm home again. I'm glad to see you. You look older. Perhaps because you missed me. You look good, anyway. You'd better get rid of some bad habits. Sadly, at your age, you can't fool around with this. Afraid of Giovanna? I know, she's jealous but surely not of me. I'm her sister. You're even more in love with him. You've every reason to be so. You should've come to visit me. The clinic was full of whores. You look splendid, you know? Thanks to Francesco, right? I've slimmed down, haven't I? If only you knew what a smash hit I was. No, not with the doctors. They were too serious. But with the nurses. Sorry, I'm talking too much. You must be starving. Come on, sit down. I'd like to serve you. You like your soup hot? I still have a good memory. Francesco, darling! Francesco, come here. You know I'm afraid of the dark. Stop it, Giovanna. It won't take long. Licia, go and fetch Pietro. Can you find your way to the kitchen? Did you hear me? No! I don't want to. Help, I don't want to. It's Licia's voice. It's coming from her room. Where are you? It was her. There's no doubt. Father? Giovanna? Where are you? Why are you hiding? Why on earth did you go upstairs? Come on, eat something. This is not the time to play. Come on. What do you want? Can I borrow your face cream? - Of course, take it. It's yours. Do you want to have breakfast with me? It depends. What are you offering? What a pity. You don't have anything that interests me. I'd like to thank you. Licia's back and it's all over now. I hope so. - Everything went well, right? Yes, but the troubles will begin now. Now that Licia has left the clinic. Her integration into the outside world won't be easy. The shock was great. The shock? - She didn't react at all to her confinement at the clinic. That's strange. She wasn't supposed to accept it so easily. I'm convinced that, deep down, Licia feels that she's been violated. That she was constrained by force to do something... you know, out of her family's interest. What can we do? - Give her love. Affection. She needs to be protected. Loved. She needs to feel integrated into her family again. A real family. Alright, Doctor. Don't worry. Licia will have everything she needs. Of course, I'm sure she will, but it won't be easy. Licia received a shock. You've been a great help to me. Will you drop me in town? - Willingly. You have some shopping to do? No, I have to see a friend. - Anyone I know? No, I don't think so. He was in the clinic where you never came to visit me. He's escaped. - Escaped? We should call the clinic immediately. The gate is closed. I got such a fright. You haven't changed at all. You never find your way home. I've been waiting for you. Lost your tongue? I'm not a ghost. It's really me. One comes out of those places alive, darling. Different maybe, but alive. I can explain everything. You're afraid. You're afraid of an old friend like me. You've settled down. Your business pays off well. You're still a fine art photographer. No, Licia, please. It was your father's fault. He forced me. I didn't want to hurt you. - He forced you? My father forced you by paying you 20 million? Poor Mario. It must've been too much for you! I won't kill you. I won't crush you because I need you. But you'll have to play my game. Alright, Licia. I'll do everything you want. - I know you will. You've no choice. And don't think you can play games with me. I can kill you whenever I want to. I'm mad, don't forget it. It's easy to kill someone. Look. All I have to do is pull the trigger. It's not loaded, you fool. I told you I needed you... Alive. My brother applied for a job. Any hope? - Yes, we'll find him a job. Darling, is that you? Yes, Laura. Darling... We haven't seen each other for a week. It's not easy to get away from Rome any more. - Will your husband make it? He works so hard, they should make him Prime Minister. Minister would be enough. - You have no idea what it takes. I'm exhausted. I really hope he makes it. Especially for us. The branch in Rome will do the trick. - Only a branch? I have other plans, dear. Big deals. The factory is nothing in comparison. It's a project for a motorway. It's not been approved yet. All that's needed is the nomination of my husband as minister. It's a deal worth millions. - Of course. The plots of land will be worth 30 times more. You buy one for 1 million, sell it for 30 and you'll soon be a millionaire. A millionaire. Come on, Giovanna. Let's go for a swim. It's so cold, blast it. Are you ready? The deputy's coming for the opening of the leisure centre. I can well believe it. It was his idea. He invited many film crews. There should be plenty of people... And everyone must be enthusiastic. - He needs some publicity right now. The idea of being a minister drives him mad. When I think about millions spent on the swimming pool... Money well spent. He's a very sound investment. - Invite anyone who asked to be hired. It's an old trick. We used it for the opening of the canteen. Then, the football field. And above all, for the deputy's rallies during the elections. - I know. Some people won't come. But there are the Southerners. They will come. Take a seat. Sort out the purchase of all the land. They must all be bought soon. In your name, of course. I mustn't figure in this deal. I'm too close to our future minister. Indeed. I've already negotiated with some landlords. It's a matter of appeal, Sir. If they all were women, everything would be finalized by now. Can't you stay any longer? I can't. I've a meeting with your father. What's it to you? In a few years, that factory will be yours. I mean... ours. That's why I need to deal with it now. In our own interest. That's why you married me, isn't it? For the factory? What is it? Nothing. A silly thing. Such a thing has never happened to me. This useless opening can ruin me. It's your fault. - Mine? Remember what I've done for you? The votes I secured for you. - You were well-paid for that. The factory. You helped me to build it up. You did it for a reason. - Alright, you obtained the votes. Don't forget that, without me, you'd still have a factory with four workers. How can I forget it when you remind me all the time? I'm sick of all this. Stop it. Soon, there'll be thousands of people out there watching you two argue. - Good. All the better. There'll be a crowd. - Shall we also film the scene? The cameramen are here. But I'm leaving. - Why? You came for the inauguration of the swimming pool. Go on, inaugurate it. Try not to talk rubbish. Otherwise, even those who came, will leave. I'm really fed up with such a fool. Don't be silly. We need that fool. We made him, didn't we? Give him enough rope and, above all, put up with him although he's a bore. Soon, he'll be very useful to us. - Yes, I know. But his arrogance has become unbearable. Listen carefully to me! When we began you were just a poor devil and he was a provincial hack. I was the one who put you two together. And, together, we were lucky. Now, we can move up and you must stop this foolish rivalry. Is that clear? They've already walked around the town. They're on their way here. It was a real triumph, Ma'am. - Fine. Give the starting signal as soon as they get here. What's all this mystery? - Little professional secrets. Are you buying those plots of land? Sure. Paterlini is taking care of it. Let's go. Here it is, Your Eminence. I'm very curious to see this surprise of yours. I'm going to show you a special film. With a great title: "Pilgrimage to Lourdes." I organised it myself with the help of Paterlini for the workers at my factory. Licia, please. It's only a little thing, Eminence but it was an unforgettable experience. I'm certain of it, my child. Tell me: did all your workers come? - Not all of them. Most of them. We're organising another pilgrimage and we hope they all will come this time. Even those who've been reluctant. Only a few. You too will be enthusiastic about it. Licia, turn off the light. Paterlini will be our commentator. Come along. The pilgrims... The pilgrims walk to the sanctuary guided, as always, by their chairman, their material and spiritual leader. Just by looking at their faces it is possible to understand the spiritual happiness of the workers and their strong aspiration to much higher things, more noble, more beautiful... Here we are. Finally in the sanctuary. The first to enter, as usual, is our dear chairman. Always ready for these encounters with faith. Put on the light. You're wanted on the phone, Sir. Did you enjoy the film? How much do you want this time? You've learned your lesson? How much do you want for all the copies of the film? - It's not so simple. The people involved are more important than Licia. How much do you want? I'd pay any price. I don't want money. I want to marry your daughter. My daughter? I want to be your son-in-law, dear Mr. Brignoli. You're out of your mind. Maybe. But so is Licia. We'll be a perfect couple. I give you three days to think it over. I'll be waiting for you Wednesday, at six. Otherwise... A lot of people will laugh out loud when they see your interesting pilgrimage. Perhaps we're all insane. All of us. - Try and get some sleep. What's going on in this house? We're rich, powerful but no one wants to see us. We're always more alone. And whoever approaches us, only does so for money. Even you. You'd have never married me if I... - That's not true. And you know it, Giovanna. I love you. I know you love me. But you'd have never married me if I hadn't been Brignoli's daughter. Licia! Turn off that blasted record player Enough. I've had it. I've one advantage over the others. I was a business deal to you. Not only a woman but also a source of wealth. You got a bargain. I don't know what's on your mind but if talking rubbish makes you feel better, then, go ahead. Talk. - We did everything wrong, Francesco. We've always been afraid to live our own lives. Always accepting everything without ever having the courage to say no. Never refusing. Living like this makes me feel useless, empty... Dead. What can we do about it? Nothing. May I ask you a question? Please do. If I fell into the sea, into a terribly rough sea, and you saw me battered by the waves would you jump into the sea to rescue me? Of course I would. But the thing is I can't swim. I don't like this place. Let's go. - As you wish. Did you know you're a fantastic dancer? I consider myself a modern man. At the party, you flirted with every girl except me. That's not true. I didn't flirt with you only out of discretion. You've a terrible reputation. Lies. If they talk about you in town, then, there's a reason for that. Well, perhaps, there is some truth in it. You see, life is so boring in the provinces. And women are the only antidote against boredom. So, I try to amuse myself as best I can. Would you do me a favour? My motto is: "Never say no to a pretty girl like you." I'd like to see my father's chalet. Never tell your father that I brought you here, please. It's not easy for a girl to tell certain things to her father, don't you think? It's really fabulous here. What are you standing there for? We're not yet married and already cheating on me. Did you like the show? - Not much. The young actor was mediocre. This joke is in poor taste. - Poor taste? The right words for this affair: an attempted rape at your age. Shame on you. - Poor father. How he will suffer when he finds out what his most trusted aide did. Just thinking about it makes me want to cry. What're you talking about? I'm leaving. It's not nice of you to leave like that. Let go of me or I'll report you to the police. Will you tell them you tried to rape me? Certain things are better left unsaid. We might even keep quiet. What... What do you want? Come on, tell us what you have to do for my father. I know absolutely nothing. I want to get out. - I'll refresh your memory. The purchase of those plots of land. Talk. - No, I'll never talk. "Never" is an ugly word. I'm sure that you'll talk. - No, I won't. Yes, you will. You will talk. THEY'RE CHEATING YOU DON'T SELL Nothing. He didn't make it. He didn't get into the government? - No, and it's your fault. My fault? - Yes, yours. After the outrage caused by the papers, the Party decided to get rid of him. They're excluding him? They say that, to make him minister after all this scandal, would be counter-productive. A complete ruin. For a deal that's fallen through, that motorway was very costly. What shall we do now? - What can we do? Nothing. We're practically done for. We'll have to start afresh. All that we've done has come to nothing. We'll make it, Laura. Everything will be like it was before. It won't be like it was before. It's over. Everything. I'm tired of this life. Tired of you and your continual failures. You were the one who ruined my work. My work, understand? Because it was me, me alone, who made a powerful man of you. Fine. Sooner or later, the truth had to come out. I didn't mean to. I'm very tired. - Don't worry. Nothing will change. We'll keep on living like we've always done. Marco, I'm afraid. What's happening? It's as though there was someone trying to destroy us. But who? I don't know. And I don't want to know. Of course I want to marry Mario. Only, I thought you wouldn't agree. Yes, Mario is far from being a saint. You know what he does. A little blackmail now and then. I'm convinced that, once integrated into a close-knit, real family like ours that boy will get back on the right track. He has potential. - He's a good photographer. You don't have to convince me. I love Mario. And I want to marry him. - Good. That's what counts. I'm sure everything will be fine. I'm happy for you. I'm happy too. What are you happy about? Know why? Father has agreed to let me marry Mario. What wonderful news. Our family renews the line with fresh blood. First-rate blood. First a playboy then a blackmailer. We're getting somewhere. Giovanna, you shouldn't say such things. - Yes, you're right. I shouldn't have done many other things. I shouldn't have lived here nor lived this useless life. But most of all, I shouldn't have a father like you! All this is so stupid. What's your game? Don't you realise you're trying to destroy people who're already dead? They're all dead, Licia. Only, they don't know it. Go away, Licia. Don't stay there. Go. We can't give you anything because we have nothing. Only our faces to save. And they're not worth very much. Why did you want to make love? It's the first time since I came home. And the last time was with you. We're going to be married, remember? It seems impossible to me. - Impossible? According to my father, you're the best guy in the world. I never thought you'd accept. - Poor Mario. You don't believe it. A small-time blackmailer like you. Brignoli's son-in-law. Of course I'll marry you. If it's not you, it'll be someone else. An event like a wedding must be celebrated. It'll be beautiful living with you. To our love. What're you doing? Are you mad? Not now. I don't want to. Please. Of course it was an accident. What do you think happened? I want the death certificate today. Today. You understand? The funeral will take place tomorrow. Privately. Alright. See you later. Did you enjoy the film? - How much do you want this time? You've learned your lesson? - How much for the copy of the film? It's not so simple. The people involved are more important than Licia. - How much? I'd pay any price. How much? I'd pay any price. I don't want money. I want to marry your daughter. I want to be your son-in-law, Mr. Brignoli. You're out of your mind. Maybe. But so is Licia. You're out of your mind. - Maybe. I don't want money. I want to marry your daughter. You'll never marry her. I give you three days to think it over. You're out of your mind. - Maybe. How much for the film? How much for the copies of the film? I've plenty of those tapes, father. Why did you kill Mario? It wasn't me. You shot him. With your gun. Yes, I know. That gun is mine. But I took it away. I expected as much from you. But I've got the gun now. I've hidden it and it'll come out when I want it to. You're a monster. Watch it, I might even kill you. - You already did once, father. You're trapped now, father. There's no escape. I can have you accused of Mario's murder any time. Don't you realise I'll destroy you like I destroyed all the others? Sure, like all the others. Mario, Giovanna and now, me. What do you want? Nothing. You can't give me anything any more. Everything you have is mine now. It's mine. Because, I'm your sole heiress by now. You know that? Everything will go on as before as if nothing had happened. And Mario? They'll never suspect us. They have no proof. I've the proof of your guilt. And I'll keep it secret. So, this is what you want. You want to see me die little by little, slowly. This is the first time we understand each other, father. You realized perfectly well that you'll have to live, day after day in fear, in terror that I might do something. Something which might crumble your kingdom of clay. And you'll be alone to face this life. Always more alone. So much alone that you'll wish yourself dead rather than alive. So much alone that you'll want me to be near you. Near you...
