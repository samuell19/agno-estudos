However took fancy to your baby left the pram here Then carried him away I'm hoping they dropped something in transit Dropped what? Pencil, button,glove anything He's found something Teething ring is it yours?

No,I've never heard the name before This is torn from the page of a cheap novel,by the look of it Might lead somewhere But how do you know these bits and pieces have anything to do with Simon? We don't for certain but we'll find out And what is happening to him while you're chasing buttons and ice cream? Who's looking after him? Sue,you're only making it worse But they don't understand he may be cold or hungry he's only just learned to walk If they put him down he might fall Suppose they are upstairs Is this all you're going to do,Inspector? Rake up over this rubbish? We aren't as inactive as we seem,Mr Cochrane All over the country hundreds of men are looking for your baby Slides are being made of his photograph It will be shown on cinema and television screens This is just part of our routine We think it's important I'm sorry I can't bear my wife to be so frightened Back home this is a constant fear I suppose people here bring up their kids without thinking about it Can't we do something? Anything? Go home and get some rest Mrs Cochrane We'll call you directly if there's any news -Who are they,Sir? -A young American couple She designs dresses, he's an official at the Embassy She doesn't sound very American to me Oh I dare say they met abroad somewhere Check up on Cochrane,Lyel Ask the Foreign Office to find out what He does at the Embassy There might be an element of international blackmail in it -You never know -Right,Sir Such devil of a thing to happen to a couple in a strange country They won't sleep much tonight Come on,Sue We must get some rest Try and lie down for a little bit I'll get you a hot drink I don't want anything I can't stop thinking about the Jordan baby Jordan baby?
