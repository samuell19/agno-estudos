Bit by bit, we are starting to get a relatively clearer picture as to how exactly this community quarantine on the Philippines' capital region Metro Manila will be implemented. Beginning March 17 until April 13, the entire Luzon is under enhanced community quarantine. A strict home quarantine will be observed in all households. Community quarantine is hereby imposed in the entire of Metro Manila. And in other areas, the LGUs are advised to abide by the following guidelines. Movement shall be limited to accessing basic necessities; Provision for food and essential health services shall be regulated; and there will be heightened presence of uniformed personnel to enforce quarantine procedures. In accordance with the recommendation by the Inter-Agency Task Force or IATF headed by the Department of Health Malacañang said it's all systems go for the implementation of the total lockdown all over the Philippines starting tomorrow, March 15, 2020. And will last for a month and a half. Contingent on the spread of the deadly COVID-19 virus. Damn. As of yesterday, the total number of active COVID-19 cases in the country is 34 and seven infected Filipinos have already died. With the implementation of the total lockdown, only those who fall in the category of essential government workers, frontliners or those working in the hospital, media men and food manufacturing workers are allowed to come out of their dwelling. The rest of the population, especially senior citizens and children who are considered vulnerable to the coronavirus, are advised to stay at home and take precautionary measures like wearing a face mask, handwashing and social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus. Based on the latest data released by the World Health Organization, there are currently over 1.5 million cases around the globe and almost 100 thousand deaths due to the coronavirus. 80 percent of the world's COVID-19 cases are those considered immunocompromised or currently suffering from other diseases like hypertension, diabetes and cancer related illnesses. Meanwhile, following the total lockdown of countries in North America... including the United States and Canada and other European countries... like the UK, France, Italy and Spain, other Southeast Asian countries... like Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia are also closing its borders... As the number of COVID-19 cases continue to rise around the world. Hundreds of thousands of passengers, including... Returning citizens and mostly tourists are stranded, leaving them... with no choice but to rebook. or cancel their flights. I’m gonna wash. Hey, babe, are you sure that your Aunt Angie is going to be okay with my parents staying with her? - Of course, Aunt Angie loves guests. - And Pippa as well? She loves kids, too. - Here you go. - Okay. Sure. I just want to get some work done before they arrive. - I'm so tired. - Yeah, go ahead. Thank you, by the way. My pleasure. After all this time, I still can't understand why you eat your sandwiches like that. If I didn't eat my sandwich like this, then you would never have noticed me. - I noticed you for other reasons. - Like what? Like your beautiful smile, babe. Alright. No. I only have this beautiful smile because of you. Speaking of food, actually. How about for lunch? I can make sinigang, extra sour. Just like your parents like. And some chicken adobo for Aunt Angie. - Sounds good, no okra? - No okra just for you. Yeah, sorry. Even if I love it, I'll take it out for you. You're my olive girl, so it's fine. How about groceries for the rest of the week? I went grocery shopping yesterday so I think we should be good for about a week or so. No idea what's going to happen next when the lockdown starts. - Does anyone? - Actually it starts tomorrow. What about work? I go in at around 9 AM, and I should be done by dinner time. Sure. Alright, this was a complete mess at the moment. I don't know what's going to happen next. Just be careful out there. We'll see. I really don't know what's going on yet. No, I don't think anyone does. Yeah. UK's been completely a mess lately as well. - Everywhere is a mess. - Yeah. That's how it is in the end. But we'll get through it, we always do. Sofia, you behave. Please come in. - Good morning Ma'am. - Good morning. - Sir, good morning. - Good morning. - This is everything. - Go inside. Please bring them inside the room. Kindly arrange them. Also clean the bathroom please because we have visitors coming today. - I'll take care of it. - Thank you. Yuck. These people are such pigs. Give it to me. Ugh, disgusting! Come here. - Oh my! - Mom, what's that? That's nothing. They are so dirty. So disgusting. It's sickening, leaving their mess behind. So nasty! So vulgar! My God! You know, they will probably go to hell. - Why? - They only think of their wordly desires. So don't be like them. Do you want a banana, or an apple? Apple comes fine with the sandwich. Do you know that this Corona Virus is a sign that we are all sinners? We are all being punished for our sins. Because now the world is full of carnal desires. The youth of today is immersed in sexual pleasures. See, your father left us for another woman. Why? Because I'm a one-man woman. I'm scared to go to hell. Don't think of boys yet. - Hi ma'am, we are already done. - Thank you. Where is the AC repairman? Oh Jomar? He was supposed to be here already. I'll check on him. Maybe that's him. - Come in. - Good morning. I'm sorry for being late. It was hard to get in your building they were so strict. - The AC is here. - I'll go ahead, please fix their AC. Thank you ma'am. I'm going to take the trash out and get something from downstair. Sure. The AC is leaking. It doesn't cool the room. I will check first, maybe it needs more freon. Do you have a ladder I can use? Excuse me. - Would you be able to take this? - Yes, sir. Thank you. Walk faster. Ma'am, take the elevator. No, sir. We're not allowed. - We have garbage. - Are you sure? Yeah, we need to use the stairs. - Okay. - Thank you. Open it. Go down there. - Hey, how was your morning? - Good morning sir, I'm doing good. - Good, you ready to go, shall we? - Shall we? Yeah. So what are you doing during the lockdown? I'm going to go back to my province, sir. You'll be back in a couple of weeks, right? I think so, sir. - Do you have it? - Of course. Thank you, sir. Thank you, you take care of yourself, okay? - Alright, sir. - Thank you. Ma'am, your AC is fixed. Thank you, how much? Three thousand. - Are you done? - Yeah. Sir, it's done. - How much? - Three thousand. I'll take care of the ladder. Thank you. Boys, when are we doing the transfer? - Probably tomorrow. - Tomorrow? I don't want to get caught. This is my big moment. - No problem. - I did a lot of work to get this quiet. No shit. Thank you boss. I got you. And you. This isn't what we talked about. What we talked about? - Where's the rest? - It's good for now. For now? This isn't what we talked about. That's good for now. Where's the rest? I'll get you the rest later. - Not later. - I always pay, right? Always pay? Who's to say you're not going to screw me over like the others? That's true, but you're just going to have to trust me. I don't trust you. Too bad. - I'm not playing. - That's good for now. I want the full payment. Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Don't put that on my chest. I brought you on this deal because I wanted to help you. I'm doing you a favor. What favor? Where's the rest? What are you going to do? You'll get your payment. I'm going to rat you out. You're going to rat me out? You sure you want to do that? Sure you want to do that? Try me. Try me. - You're unbelievable. - Excuse me? Get off me. Stupid slut. - You don't know what's coming for you. - Coming for me? Move. - Can you believe that? - Crazy, man. I always pay, right? Relax, boss. Damn bitch. Jean has a show today. Which one is Jean again? Oh, her. For days now, much has been talked about corona virus and it's deadly nature. - Theories from the medical... - She looks so good. This has been discussed numerous times but this time around... They're talking about surviving. We invited someone - from the Christian community. - It's about the covid thing. Why would they get a pastor instead of a nurse? Please welcome Pastor Dante Cruz. Hello, Pastor. What do you think about this pandemic? Well, first of all, thank you for having me. I think this is a sign that God is watching us. And this is what we've been preoccupied with that we tend to center our lives with earthly material things that we tend to forget him. On the other hand. Anything bad happens, it's just God's will. Remember God's grace, and it's everlasting... What kind of qualifications do you need to be a pastor anyway? Believe in God. So 90 percent of the population? Do not fear for I'm with you. Do not be dismayed for I am your God and I will strengthen you and help you. I will uphold you in my righteousness. Sounds like bullshit to me. Who even watches this nowadays? I wonder how the ratings are doing. Do you mean to tell us, Pastor, that we deserve this pandemic and God led this to happen? Well, let me put it this way. This pandemic, I believe is a result of our own shortcomings. In a way, it's our fault. Because there are some theories that were saying that the virus was invented or scientifically modified. In order to create chaos and disrupt our activities, which is happening now Assuming we all survive this pandemic, how can we prevent this from ever happening again? I have a simple answer for that. Repent, repent, and repent. It's the right time that we denounce all our earthly desires. So what do you mean, exactly by that, Pastor? Is the world coming to an end? No doubt about it. The end of the world is upon us. And this pandemic is only one of the many signs attached to it. What we urgently need and do is ask forgiveness for all our sins. And do things according to God's teachings. - Babe. - Yes? - Guess who messaged? - Who? Candice. What she's saying? She's asking about tonight. But we have your parents, Pippa and Aunt Angie, coming over. It's the lockdown tonight as well. I don't think it's a good time. I mean, we've been trying to set this up for a while and now she's... I'll just get more details. Yeah, we'll figure it out later. I'll just finish cooking. Okay. Smells good. I can smell the onions on your hand though. It must be them. - Hello. - Hi. Come in. Hi Pippa. - It's so good to see you. - Hi there. - I brought you some stuff. - Just put it in the kitchen. Aunt, let me help you with that. - How are you? - Okay, I'm fine. Alright, here. Let's get this out. - Look at you. - I've missed you. That's fine. Hey Dad. I got to get this off. You're so much bigger, aren't you? - How are things? - Very well. - How are you? Yeah. - Good. We're so excited to have you. Do you guys want some tea? Yes, please. That would be lovely. Well, let's go. Oh, this is pretty heavy. Let's get everyone some tea. Come and sit next to Dad. Look at you. Look how big you've gotten. Yes, he has. - He's doing really well at school now. - Really what grade is he in now? I know it's not grade anymore is it? Classes? Yeah, it's class. Class one. - I've been in the Philippines too long. - Yeah. Clearly. - Clearly. - We know. - Sorry. - Yeah, we do know. What have you been up to? - You've been traveling around as well. - Yes. We've had a lot of fun. Yeah. I got to get out of here because I might get stuck. And with this lockdown thing or whatever it's crazy. - I'll just go serve this to them. - Yeah, sure. Here you go. What did you do there? - I went swimming. - You went swimming. Do you like to swim now? - Thank you. I need this. - I'll be right back. - So how are things in the UK right now? - It's wonderful, it's cold there. It's not like how it is here. I wanted to stay in my place. My house is longer, but I have to get back. - What's your favorite vegetable? - My favorite vegetable is "kalabasa." - Kalabasa? - That's right. - Pumpkin. - Okay. Wait, enough about me. How was your wedding? I'm sorry I missed it. I can't believe you haven't seen the videos yet. Yeah, I can't wait to see it. You have to show me. I need a copy for myself so I can see. - I'll send you a copy. - I'm gonna cry by myself. Yeah, well, we had a really fun week. Yeah, it would have been better if you'd been there with us of course. Just been busy with work, just preparing before the lockdown and everything. Yeah. I know it's a work from home but I still need to have a stable internet access, just to get the work done. Then taking time off hasn't. So you what? You really have a duty tomorrow? - Yes. - Oh, no. Yeah, it's been hectic and it's only going to get more hectic now. - You have to be safe. - Yes. Because you're going to have a baby soon, right? Well, not during the pandemic, but yeah, the hospital has explained all safety precautions to us, so we're aware how to be safe during this time. Hopefully after the pandemic. Edward can also give me a baby finally. But we'll see if he changes his mind. And you let Aunt take care of the babies? You guys have fun and do your thing. Aunt Angie, your favorite food. - Thank you. - Oh, wow. - Oh, my goodness. - Ria, I miss your cooking. This is the best. Speaking of the best, you know what? My first, wait, second husband. You remember Bill right? Yes. He was also the best at cooking, but he was the worst in bed, I mean. Aunt! There's a kid here. Sorry, sweetheart. It's okay. He's a big boy, come on. You remember George. Right? Okay, so George, he's like, if you remember, he's like around 65. The problem with him we're not together now is because he would always sleep on me. I mean, do you do that to girls? When you and the girl gets ready and she's all set to go, you don't do that, honey. You're already on top. And he falls asleep. You're like, I just want to slap him. Men, they don't change. Yeah, well, we're still young. Here in the Philippines they say "when you still can, go for it." When you still can, have some fun. Right? Come on Carol, they can. I'm sorry. [chattering] When we do these last even the... Hello everyone. Thank you so much for coming. Thank you, enjoy. I really like that. Hello everyone. Good evening. Thank you so much for coming. - Are you enjoying? - Yes. Edward, your father and I are just so happy that you found love. And that the two of you are going to have a future together. Ria, we welcome you into the family. I just wanted to share a few words about partnership and being together. Being in a partnership, you need... It was a great day. And the dress was amazing. Ria, you really looked so gorgeous in that dress. - Thanks, Mom. - Look at that handsome guy. - Look at daddy. - Edward looks so hot. Know this marriage is a sacred bond through good times and bad times. I'm very happy for you both. And we are going to be there for you. As we have been with you before. So we wish you the very best. Do you think they look very much in love? It does not boast. It does not envy. Like what I always tell you who is patient? It's your father. And who is more kind. It's still your father. Edward. Please take good care of my daughter. I love you. You guys are so beautiful. - What's the name of that friend? - Erin. - You knew her a long time, right? - Yes. Wow Carol, you look like a bombshell. You know what? I have to stop myself from crying. My friendship with Ria started seven years ago when she was introduced to me by one of our close friends. And since then, she has always been my best friend. My partner in crime, and my confidant. Ria, I hope that this marriage will not change the special bond that we have. And Edward, I hope that you take good care of her. Please keep in mind that I will always be here, no matter what challenge you guys may face. I wish you all the best and I hope that you may love each other unconditionally. Congratulations, newlyweds. It's such a nice setup. - Well, here you are again. - Yes, Hello. Hey. Are you sure this time? Because you've already stood us up twice. We can't right now. My parents are over. Maybe a bit later tonight, maybe around nine. I'll need to double check with Ria. Yeah, I'll confirm with her and I'll get back to you. But are you sure this time? Okay, just before lockdown, then. Alright, I'll talk to you later. Yeah. That's really so sad you weren't there. I would have loved a speech from you. Grandma, I need to pee. Alright, he needs to use the bathroom. Yeah, I'll take him. That's just this way. Just through this room. It's good, they're spending time. It's been so long. - Do you need any help? - No, it's okay. Okay. I'll be out here when you're done. Have a seat. Did you wash your hands? - Yes. - Well, good. - How are you feeling? - Good. - You good? - Yes. Pippa. You know I love you, right? Do you ever feel that I don't love you at all? No dad, I also love you. Really? Do you understand why I'm not always around? Yes daddy, I understand. Okay. How do you like it here? Do you ever think that maybe someday you'd want to stay here with me and Ria? You do know why I'm not around right? You know, we live far apart, and you know you're with your grandma and grandpa at the moment. But it's not forever. I need just a couple more years? You can come over. Stay here. Just give me a bit of time. Would you like that? Pippa, you look just so much like your mother. Come here. That's your friend, right? [chattering] [chattering] So in love. Sweet moments... - It's time. - Already? Yeah, we have to be two hours early for the flight. - We're going to go. - I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too. Thank you so much. But we really have to pack and a lot of things to do. [chattering] - I mean, it must have been nice. - Yeah, it was fine. Let me get that for you. - You take care. - For sure. You go with grandpa. You need to spend more time with him. No, it's good. It's nice to have a visit once in a while. See you soon Pippa. Won't you like to spend a little more time with your son? A little bit more often, maybe after this whole pandemic situation is over. Well, visiting is not enough, is it? I mean. He does need a father. - He's better off in the UK. - He's not, what makes you think that? Why would he be better without a father? The education system is better in the UK, healthcare system is better in the UK. He's young, he doesn't need that. What he needs is an education. No, he doesn't. He needs a father. Well, I'm not ready for that. Do you know what, young man? You need to grow up. He's better off in the UK. - He's better off in the UK, I'm not ready. - He's your responsibility. He's your son. You have just been relying on me and your father to look after your child. - Your child needs to be with you. - Let's not fight in front of him. He wants to be with you. Take responsibility. I just told you, I'm not ready. Jim, help me out here. This is... Edward, we told you numerous times. It is high time you take responsibility for your responsibilities in life. You are immature, childish, and above everything else, you are selfish. It's just about you, you, you. Do you ever give any thought to myself, to your father, to your son, to his life? What is best for him, not what is best for you? You know what, Mom? Just go. - Well, that's it? - Yes. You're going to let us walk out of the door with your son. No emotion. You started this. Just go. Say goodbye to your son atleast. Give him a hug. Honey, let's go. We need to catch the flight, come on. - Come on, let's go. - That's a waste of time. Where's that damn mask? Let's go. - See you soon aunt. Take care. - Take care. Take care Ria. Come on, come. How would you define a relationship, Doc? Well, personally a relationship for me is synonymous with connection. Maybe with another person, an animal, a thing, or even a place. But from a psychological standpoint, study suggests that a relationship focuses on the interaction between two individuals; paying close attention to both behavior and what goes on in people's minds, like emotions and cognitions. Okay, so how do people know that they are in good relationships? Well, basically, when there is harmony between them; when they complement each other, when both parties are free to do and say what pleases them and when trust is present and added in a relationship. So the term toxic relationship has been a byword these days. - Yes. - So how would you define Doc, what is a toxic relationship? Alright, simply put, it is the opposite of a healthy relationship. Now, some signs of a toxic relationship are fear of confrontation, dishonesty, patterns of disrespect, lack of support, miscommunication, resentment, and jealousy. What are the common types of relationship? Okay, we have six commonly considered types of relationships. There is a platonic where you have a relationship without sex. We have the romantic or feelings of love and attraction through commitment, intimacy and infatuation. There's what we call codependent, which is basically an imbalanced relationship because one partner typically has to take care of the other. There's a casual relationship where it involves sex without commitment. There's the one we just discussed, the toxic relationship, which is unhealthy because it harms you emotionally, physically and psychologically. - I need to get ready. - And there's the open relationship. Which is a consensual non-monogamous relationship where both partners sleep with other people. Yeah, pretty much. Would you consider these healthy? Yes and no. Yes, because there are some who can't, or aren't ready for commitment, but in other aspects, they're ready to have sex. Now, the same goes in an open relationship. Some couples, as their relationship progresses, resort to engaging in sex with other people, not because they are no longer in love with their partners, but it's just to add flavor or spice to the relationship. And no, because it leads to a lack of self-esteem for oneself, or in relationships in general. So with regards to open relationships or just any relationship in general, why is it common to have sex with other persons, for example, say a threesome? Okay, that's a good one. Now, according to studies and some accounts, a lot of people consider a threesome to be like some kind of ultimate sexual fantasy. They also get the satisfaction of knowing two people want to have sex with them. So I suppose you can say it's an ego boost. Well, again, these are based on years of research and studies... First and foremost, don't sacrifice too much for your relationship. You know, relationships tend to work best with a mutual give and take. Another one is don't lose yourself in the relationship. Being close to your partner is a positive, but it's also important not to lose your individuality. And lastly, don't avoid every conflict, you know, by dealing with minor problems as they arise, you can prevent them from blowing up into major fights. Very well said, Dr. Pineda. What an enlightening discussion we had today. I certainly learned a lot. Thank you for being on our show. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. Hey, it's me. Yeah. So, 9 PM? - So I was thinking. - What is it? About Candice? - Do you want us to cancel? - No. If anything, I'm excited. It's just I'm a bit nervous as well. That's alright. Well, we've been planning this for a while. She's finally said that she's available, - So just roll with it, see how it goes? - Yes. Do we have enough food, you think? I think so. I don't know how to do this really. Does she stay? We do it, and then she goes, or... I don't know. I've always... What is the etiquette? Showtime. I think that should be her, I'll let her in. - Hello, come in. - Hi. Hi Ria, where's Edward? Right there preparing our cheese platter. - Hi. - Hello. How are you? - Nice to finally see you guys. - After two, or three failed attempts... - I'm sorry. - That's alright. That's a nice-looking cheese platter, Edward. Thanks. Have you eaten already? - This is fine. - Okay. - To tonight. - To tonight. How's work with you and Edward? I mean, as a nurse, it's going to be a bit hectic in the coming months, but it's okay. I'm not exactly sure how I'm going to deal with you being away for so often. I just have to work. It's okay making money. Let's see what we can do. Alright. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. That's good wine. - Welcome. Come inside the room. - Thank you. Nice place guys. My God, you have an amazing view. - How long have you lived here? - Since we got married. About three years. Yeah, it's been about three years now. Came over here just straight away. Yeah. Oh, okay. In terms of the ground rules that you set up. I've done my shaving thing, I felt really weird. - I've done that. - Thank you. Candice, I know you sent us your results, and I just wanted to give you ours. But even with all of this, I'd like us to take some pills just to be safe. It's just so that none of us can pass on any diseases to each other. Thank you. Help me with that. - Thank you. - Here you go. Thank you. That smells good. Yeah, that's going to help. Sorry, it's a little bit strong. Thank you. If you want to come inside me, just please use a condom. For that part, it's okay. - He can finish inside me. - Okay. Cool. - You sure? - Yeah. Okay. - Yeah, that's good. - Alright. Shoot. - What's wrong? - I messed up. Did you cum? - Sorry. - Did you just cum? Yeah. - Are you serious? - I couldn't hold it. What the heck? Wait Ria. Sorry. I know this isn't what we agreed to. We have some pills that you can take. It's okay. I think we can all agree that what happened isn't what we talked about. Are you okay? It's not about that. It's about my boyfriend. What about your boyfriend? What happened? What happened? So what's up? You wanted to talk. Yeah, well, I invited you today because I wanted to celebrate about something. Okay. I'm really nervous. But it's really big news. I don't know how to say it. Use words. Is it a big promotion? No, it's something bigger. Tell me about it. I'm excited to hear. Well, how do I say this? What happened? I'm pregnant and he wants to abort the baby. I'm so sorry to hear that. Okay, what's going on? Well, this is not the kind of thing you just spring up on somebody like that. We talked about things like this, right? Right? I'm not, we're not ready. What do you mean we're not ready? - We've been together for years. - It's not about that. - It's about... - It's about what? - I'm sorry, guys. - It's okay, we're here. I'm not ready to commit to this. - To commit to me? - Can you just calm down? - Are you serious? - Yes. Stop it! People are looking at us. Why? Don't you love me? Answer me. Stop it. Alright. I'm not ready. Chris? I'm sorry, I didn't mean to put it out on you. Well, thank you, guys. - Thanks as well. - For letting me. Yeah, sorry again. - We'll see you out. - Let's go. - Thanks for coming in. - And I'm really sorry about what happened. No, it was my fault. - I want to make it up to you. - What do you mean? You deserve to be satisfied. - Unlike what happened before. - How? Let's find a guy. I'm sorry, guys. - It's alright. - It's fine. I haven't seen you around before. Are you from around here?
