Oh, I just, I just added a new feature so, well, when the app doesn't understand a word, you just type it in and it automatically connects you to the ASL site and then there's a video tutorial on how to do it. (ERROR ALERT BEEPING) Oh. Damn it. Damn it. Hold on. Hold on. One sec. Sorry. Um... Anyway, I got the idea from when you told me how hard it was for you to understand me when I'm on Skype.

(ALL LAUGH) Like, rolling on the floor, laughing my ass off. All right. Um, uh... "Hi, MTV, my name is Kendra." "I live in Malibu, I'm into blank and I love to have a good time." Okay, Matias, do you wanna go first and then... (HIGH-PITCHED) Matias! Hi, my name is Kendra. I'm from Malibu. I'm into having sex on top of a pizza and I love having a really good time. Hi, my name is Kendra. I'm from Malibu. I'm really into the systematic destruction of an entire people and their way of life. (ALL LAUGH) And I'm ready to have a good time. Try this out. Uh... Hi, my name is Kendra. I'm, uh, from Malibu and I'm into snorting coke off a clown's boner and... What? (LAUGHING) And having a good time. That's like... What does that even mean? Hey, Matias. I can see the pores on your face. What is going on over there? (LAUGHS) Like, in a good way. That actually looks like you're calling from the year 2018. I mean, it's a full 30 frames a second. I don't think you're ready for this. Oh, my God! And stereo even. I got a new laptop. (LAUGHS) What, actually new? Uh... It's like new-ish, yeah. Yeah, Craigslist. Ow, ow! But unfortunately, like, everyone now, 'cause they can see what he really looks like, everyone on Facebook's just, like, bloop, unfriending him. (LAUGHTER) (GRUNTS) So, what, are you guys going to come over or what? Um, we were going to come over, but then, um, I started having some... No! ...severe heartburn and digestive issues. I told you he was gonna do this. I never bailed when it's at one of yours. Lexx, come on, help me out here. I mean, I'm cool with Skyping. It's a subway and bus from my place, so... Ahhh! Hey, and Skype... Skype clearly works for me, so... You guys are so old. AJ, it's... AJ, it's three o'clock in the morning in London. Damon stayed up just for you. Matias. Oh, come on, guys. Guys. I got chips, and I've got dips and I... (HUSHED VOICE) I got some killer... I got some killer bud. Some what? Say that louder. What? (ALL LAUGH) What? What? I got some killer bud. Yeah, I know, I heard you. I just wanted Linda to hear it, too. (CHUCKLES) Shut up! She's not gonna... She still thinks marijuana is illegal here. (ALL LAUGH) And also, Serena, hello? I sliced you a rabbit bowl. (ERROR ALERT JAMMING) (ERROR ALERT BEEPING) MATIAS: Really? (STARTUP TONE PLAYS) (ALERT CHIMING) And third, guys, how many times do I have to tell you? It is not just the government. It is the Cicadians and the Bilderbergs and the Illuminati and corporations. Wow! Did we really devolve into politics? Why do you think Facebook and Twitter are free? Because you're the product. ALL: 'Cause we're the product. Yes! They own every single thing you post. And everybody assumes that, "Oh, it's just pictures and shit." All they really care about is targeted marketing. But the Internet, as you know it, is just the surface. You guys are just like... Oh, you just float around up there without a care in the world, but it is a deep goddamn ocean, and there are sharks swimming below you. They're just gonna... They're gonna come in from right up behind you when you don't even see it coming and they're just... Hello! No, no, no. I'm here. Keep going. Yeah, well, they're gonna come, they're gonna get ya, and then it's just sayonara. You know? It's... That's it. It's not just sharks down there, guys. There are leviathans and krakens and colossuses. Um, wait, I believe their proper plural is "colossi," mate. You know what, Google "Skyhook." Okay? You will shit yourself. It is total integration of Wi-Fi and cell towers, GPS, IP address detection, Bluetooth device tracking, even those Fitbit things you like to run around with, they can track you through that. What are you doing, Lexx? Come on. Stop it. That's not funny. Well played, well played. AJ: (LAUGHING) It's not that funny. (SCREAMING) Help me! (GRUNTS) I just wanna... (LAUGHS) Get it through your heads! Ah! Someday. Someday what? You hope we get eaten? No. Actually, I really hope you don't. Aw, you're worried. Like a big old cuddly teddy bear?

Bam! Bam! (OTHERS EXCLAIM) Yeah, right? You would love the way your shit sounds up close, Lexx. Or you would, if you were coming over, but you're not. I can't. Subway and bus from my place, remember? Before we start, there is something that we want to tell you guys. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Should we wait for Amaya? I don't think Amaya is going to be coming. Bam! (ALL SHOUTING AND CHEERING) Bam! Bam! That is amazing. Can I see it? Closer. Closer. Bam! Closer, closer, closer. I wanna see it! Oh, that's great. Wow! I'm so happy for you guys! She asked me. Okay, no, no, no, no, no, wait. You gotta tell us everything. I was having my morning cup of inspirational tea, and I swigged back the little last bit of it. Basically, almost choked on this because it was in the cup. Were you just watching her drink it the whole time, just going like, "Is... She's gonna find it soon"? "She's gonna..." Well, yeah. She puts milk in her tea, you know? So it's, like, cloudy. (LAUGHS) Awesome, guys. It's my mom's ring. OTHERS: Aw! It's your mom's ring? Oh, my God, did you... Wait, did you, uh... Did you ask Nari's dad for permission and did you film it? Please say you did, because... Oh, my God, I just... I loved the look off his face when he found out that you two weren't "roommates," and I just... I would really love to see that, that face again. AJ, it's not the time. It was cool when you stood up to him, that's all I'm saying. It's just... It's sweet. Serena, is your mom excited? Yeah. She's really excited. Cool. I just, um... You know... Uh, the cancer's progressed, so it's... Um... It's moved into her brain, and... They have her on life support, though, and they're really trying some aggressive treatment. So it's... I wish I'd asked her sooner, so we just had more time, you know? I remember when I had to put my dog down. (LAUGHS) (SNICKERING) Oh, my God. You're so bad at this. I am so... No, I am so thrilled for you guys. You have no idea. I always thought Matias and Amaya would be the first to... (IMITATES MISSILE WHISTLING, EXPLODING) Nice recovery, mate. Let's go. AJ: So... Oh, oh! And hey, um, by the way, by the way... Ha-ha-ha! (VOCALIZING) What is that? What's that? Universal Life Church. Fully certified. Took five minutes online, I could totally marry you guys. That's right. That says wedding officiant? AJ: Yep. Yeah, there's nothing more romantic than being married by the last guy you ever slept with. Uh, that is the only guy, Lexx. Nari. (VOCALIZING) AJ: Nari. (MUSIC PLAYING) Nari! (MUTED) Hi. (BOTH CHUCKLING) No. No. (AMAYA LAUGHING) AMAYA: No. (EXHALES) (LAUGHS) MATIAS: This is Amaya's favorite sunset spot. What? Ah!

(LAUGHING) Sometimes, that guy... (MUFFLED) I believe in the truth and Damon believes in the lie. And it's like, Damon believes in the smart lies and I believe in the strange truth. (AJ CONTINUES SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) (LAUGHTER) All right, no, no, no. It's not impossible, it's just... It is improbable, but... Thank you, Captain Spock. That is Ambassador Spock, and we are nothing without our chain of command. (LAUGHING) You're such a nerd, dude! (ALERT CHIMES) (WATER TRICKLING) Hey, what the hell? Sounds like someone's meditating or something. Matias, are you okay? DAMON: I thought you were going somewhere. What's going on? (WATER TRICKLING) Wait, Matias. What's going on? Do you wanna share... Share your screen, mate. Whoa. That looks like the wallpaper's actually moving. MATIAS: Yeah, it is. It switched when I connected. Connected to what? I have no idea, this... "River" thing. All right, that's... that's an overlay network. You're being bounced with an overlay. What's an overlay network? Hey, Damon. Damon, you gotta translate that, man. Oh, um, sorry, it's so no one can track you. Oh, shit! This is... Dude, this is dark-net. Yeah, probably. Damon, what's dark-net? It's part of the Internet that isn't or can't be indexed by search engines. It's where you find marketplaces for bad shit basically. Like, um, Silk Road. Damon, you know about that. It was all about drugs, illegal ID's, stolen credit cards, exploits, even assassination for hire. Lolita City, which is all about child porn, and, like, fan fiction. Okay, AJ, we got it. I know, yeah, definitely... Yeah. We got it, yeah. Yeah, maybe you should just leave whatever that is alone, Matias. Oh, wow. Okay, looks like an old school BBS. Charon. It's the ferryman of the dead. "A ferryman of Hades who carries souls" "of the newly deceased across the rivers Styx..." Styx. Sorry. "And Acheron that divides the world of the living" "from the world of the dead." Dude, whose computer did you buy? I didn't... i didn't buy it, I... There's, um... There's a cybercafe that I've been... That I've been working at, and I... I don't know, I noticed this computer was sitting in the lost-and-found for the last, I don't, three or... Three or four weeks. Wait, hang on. You stole someone's computer? No, I didn't... I didn't steal it, I just... Hold on, mate, you told me you bought it on Craigslist. I felt like shit the moment I took it. I don't know what I was hoping for, I just... I kept having to go there because... Because I wanted a better computer to work on my app with and then my thing was just moving so goddamn slow, that I thought whoever's laptop this was, I mean... But look, here, look, when I went on Facebook, all of his stuff autofilled. Norah C the fourth! (EXCLAIMS) Pretentious twat. Only an elitist ass-hat would have that kind of name. Oh, yeah, okay, Alistair Jeffcock. Hey, Jeffcock is a family name, Lexx. (CHUCKLES) Yeah. It's a fake name. Guys, it's "Charon" backwards. Charon the fourth. Charon Four. Yeah. He's one of them. He's one of them. And whoever they are, they must... This is where they meet up to trade. Trade what? Well, one of them was actually sending me private messages earlier. It was Charon 68. Well, the poor shmuck never made it to 69. Yeah, here. "Just processed the transfer. You'll have it soon." It's like he's placing an order for something he already paid for. We should... Matias, go back to the beginning. Well, the computer was acting strangely so I ran a Disk Utility and it said the drive was full, so I was looking around and I found this, uh, folder, right? It was hidden, invisible, and it's got videos. Nine hundred and sixty gigs of them. Show us. No, wait, wait, wait. Look at those addresses. That's here, that's the ones on the East Side and... (MUSIC PLAYING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) He's been wardriving. AJ: Totally. Translate, guys. Okay, hackers drive through neighborhoods trying to scoop up Wi-Fi addresses of any unsecured or vulnerable routers, so they can... Hackers can activate the camera on laptops and phones and disable the indicator lights, so you wouldn't even know that they were on. Oh. Even the director of the FBI says he keeps his covered. Yeah, so think about that next time you're servicing your porn addiction, AJ. So this guy's good. Yeah, this takes mad skills. He might be a goddamn maestro. Oh. More like a goddamn psycho. SERENA: Yeah. Hey, did you open that link in the folder? The one called "Account"? Wait, that... That's just from a couple of minutes ago. Bitcoin. That's not a real currency, right? It's cryptocurrency. No middlemen, no banks. It's ten million. That's ten million dollars, guys. Whoa. Wait, this is a joke, right? I'm... Dude, I'm just... Are you being serious right now, or...? All right, the exchange rate right now is 663.02 per XPT times 16,263.52 Yep. Yep. Ten million and change. Ten million. Do you see that? It's almost eleven. Free money just sitting there. No, no. There's no such thing as free money, AJ. I hate to burst your bubble. He's talking about the money. Well, say something. (MATIAS SIGHS) Wait, wait. Don't. Type "For what?" (SNAPS FINGERS) Hello! Hair. He's talking about hair. AJ, for once in your life just put a cork in it. Method? What... What's he...? What is that? "A surgical procedure in which a hole is drilled into the skull." Oh, my God. This is... Oh, shit! Oh, my God! AJ: Oh. Oh, shit. DAMON: No, no, no. Matias, can you just shut it off? (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) Matias, shut it off. No, I... All right, all right, all right, all right. (SIGHS) (ALERT CHIMING) DAMON: That's him, isn't it? Don't answer. Contributions? Charon 68. The first thing he wrote was that he liked the last contribution. Go back to the video folder and scroll all the way to the bottom. Just... Just go all the way down. No, Matias, don't open it. Please. Just... No, open. Just open it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't... (CHAIN RATTLES) (GRUNTING) AJ: Oh, God. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) DAMON: No, no, no. Okay, no. I can't, I can't. It...

No, no, this is... Okay. (MESSENGER RINGING) (SIGHS) Show me the most recent one. SERENA: Nari. The last one. It's a small file. It's smaller than the other ones. Oh, Jesus. Just open it. Okay. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) NARI: Wait, wait, stop. SERENA: This can't be real. NARI: Matias, go to the end. Go all the way to the end. DAMON: Why's he looking at the camera? (MESSENGER RINGING) That was it, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, then he might not have her yet. She's still in her bedroom. All the other girls weren't. Look, he chooses a girl, shows her to the rest of the group, and waits for someone to pay. And someone just paid. So this is... This is the next girl. We have to report this, Nari. Okay, we have her address, so just... We can do a reverse phone lookup. Guys, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. AJ: Matias! (MUFFLED) Matias! AJ: Matias! (MUFFLED) Matias!

You need to bring the laptop... Wait, wait, wait. ...with you because every... Where's Damon? I don't know. He said something about... No, no, no. We need Damon. Damon! Damon! Damon! What? Matias! Dude, okay, calm down! We need Damon right now. Damon! Have we called the police or what? No, we're not calling the police. We're going to the police. Okay, Matias? No, look. We don't have a lot of time, okay? We need to help this girl? Matias? Yeah. I know there's a lot going on, okay? MATIAS: Mmm-hmm. But you need to trust us. And you need to move fast. Get the laptop. Go down to the police station. I will be there, okay? No. I have a friend that will meet us. We can't. He knows how to deal with this kind of situation. We can't. We can't. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, you can. No, we can't! We can't. It's not real. What? It's, um... (CHUCKLES LIGHTLY) (STAMMERS) It's a game. I made the whole thing up. It's a game. Lexx. You were totally on to me from the beginning. Wait, I'm confused. What? Yeah, it's, um, a game. It's my game. It's the one I've been working on. Damon. Damon knows. It's... I'm sorry, I'm lost. I what now? (CHUCKLES) I told you I was writing something. Matias, I'm... Uh... Yeah, man, you said you're writing something. You didn't say play-testing nor implementing. Well, yeah, I wanted it to be... I wanted to get a natural response out of you, you know? I mean, if you knew it was coming, then it wouldn't feel real. That way I could, you know... I could tell if it actually could work. It is game night. Holy shit, man! Asshole! (GRUNTS) I guess that means it was pretty good, huh? Oh, my God! That... Matias, this is not funny. It's actually, it's... No, it's not supposed to be funny. It's actually a... Oh! Holy shit. It's an ARG. It's a horror transmedia... It's an alternate reality game. Exactly. Yeah. It's a test of what you would do if the experience actually happened. Wow! That was bloody... Wait, AJ. Were you in on this? Hell no! I had no idea about this. Dude, where'd you get those videos? That is some dark shit. Yeah. Yeah, no, I know. I just, um... War films. Ah. Okay, well, you must've dug into some really obscure shit, because I have seen everything and I haven't seen any of those videos that you dug up. What if we had called the police? (SUCKS TEETH) Well, um, ideally you would register a complaint with your cell number. So if, um... You know, by the time you logged in, if you called 911, it would hack your phone, and you would get a recording like the bad guy hacked into your phone. Wow! That... Yeah, that's crazy. Whew. Wait. (ALERT CHIMING) I went to that ASL class. Or the first one. The first one, at least. And the, the guy, (STAMMERING) he was teaching the class. He was talking about how hard it was for, um, a hearing-impaired person to have a meaningful relationship with someone who couldn't sign. And how it builds this special bond, the ability to communicate with someone in a special way that... (ALERT CHIMES) You're right. Um... I'm really fucking scared, Amaya. I mean, I'm... I've never cared about anyone or any thing the way I care about you. (ALERT CHIMES) The night we met at the bar, I... The music was so loud and... I saw you and I remember thinking, "Oh, why bother?" That a beautiful person wouldn't be able to hear you anyways, it's so loud. I didn't know you were deaf. I didn't know that all that noise wouldn't matter... That's what I want for us. I want nothing else to matter. I want nothing to be in the way of how much I love you. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (EXHALES) (MOUTHING) I love you. (STAMMERS) I need you to come here, okay?

Well, in the game, instead of Charon, just, like, being a, you know, Charon 4, like, with the number four, it had IV. And what about the girl in the video? The one who was next. What about her? (RING TONE PLAYING) Where'd you get the video? Sorry, guys. I got to take this. It's the puppet masters. Mute your mic, Lexx. Yeah. Mama. (SPEAKS INDONESIAN) Lexx, mute your mic! Oh, my God.

No. I really did think that was real for a second. I'm gonna be honest. I was totally there. It was the most fun I've had in, like, two years. Ugh. (AJ CHUCKLES) Matias. Matias. I have more questions, man. Yeah, here, I'm sorry. What's up? Is it better, like, if we did it as a team or as a solo experience? And also, like, how the hell are you handling the decision tree? Like, say if we had decided to do something with the bad guy's money, if we'd taken it, then how does that ripple through the rest of the story? Hello? Matias. Oh, bloody hell, he's away with fairies. Matias! Give me... Hold on, I'll be right back. I'll be right back. How long are you gonna be gone this time? (MUTED) Are you there? Are you there? Can you hear me? Hear me? (ALERT CHIMING) Good. Then watch this. (SIGHS) (BREATHES HEAVILY) (ALERT CHIMING) You get the computer back when I get Amaya back.

All I want is Amaya! You don't understand what you have gotten yourself into. You killed Kelly! No, I didn't. If you lay a hand on Amaya or Erica, you'll never see any of that money. Shut the fuck up and listen. They do not let girls go. What are you talking about? The circle of people I work with, all the other Charon clients, they monitor all Bitcoin accounts. They're gonna think I'm trying to cash out. (STATIC CHIRRING) MATIAS: Hello? Hello, hello? CHARON IV: I lost your screen. What's going on? What's happening? MATIAS: (STAMMERING) I don't know. CHARON IV: Oh, God, they pulled you across the River, didn't they? MATIAS: Hey, you know what? I'm just... I'm gonna close it. CHARON IV: No! Do not close it. They're gonna know you're not me! Are they talking to you? What are they saying? They're saying that, they're... They're saying, "Recite the code." CHARON IV: Oh, God. (IN NORMAL VOICE) You just put a bullet in our head. You stupid... (BREATHING HEAVILY) Okay. Listen to me. If they find out that I lost that computer, they're gonna kill me, they're gonna kill you, and they're gonna kill anyone else that might have seen it! All right, then just... Just give me the code then. Give me the money back first. And then... No, fuck you! I am ten feet away from Amaya and I will put a knife in her throat and disappear before she even hits the ground. Then you're a dead man who lost ten million dollars. This can be so easy. I return Amaya, you return the laptop, and it'll be like nothing ever happened. No, you killed Kelly! No, I didn't. I just bashed her head. She'll wake up and think it was a robbery or something. We have no time for this. (SIGHS) Return the money. No. No. No, no, no. When Erica Dunne is home safe, then you get the money. Okay. You better hurry up. They said this is your last chance, Charon IV. Okay, okay. Type "A-B-Y-S-S-U-S." Second word, "A-B-Y-S-S-U-M." Third word, "i-N-V-O-C-A-T." Wait. They're typing in all-caps. Should it be in all-caps? Just fucking send it! Okay. All right. They're asking why you drained the account. Tell them I switched from Bitcoin to Ethereum. They're asking why. It's a better exchange rate. I got a tip. Are they buying it? Yeah. Think so. (BREATHING HEAVILY) We'll be there soon. You'll get Amaya. And you'll get your laptop. If I let Erica go, they're gonna think she escaped, and... They're gonna lose faith, they're gonna hold me liable. Yeah, well, you have ten million dollars to help you figure out how to disappear. If anything goes wrong between here and there, you're both dead. (STATIC CRACKLES) (LAPTOP CHIMES) He's lying to us. You can... Why would we... Guys, he's back. Matias. Yo. What? Hey, Nari, it is just a game. I found her, okay? I found the girl... Found who? Matias, from your video. She's real, her name's Erica Dunne. She is real, and she's really missing. No, Nari, I know, I know. I just... That was a... Is it just a placeholder or, like... Yeah. No, it is, it is. It's a placeholder. It's just... It's just... Dude, that's messed up, man. Where did you even get the video? LiveLeak. Yeah, someone on the inside just must've leaked it or something, I don't know. Why would you use that video? Okay, you know what? Send the link. Nari, that's ridiculous. What? Who's that? Is that Amaya? Turn on your video, love. Matias. Get him off. Matias, is that you? How do we get this person off? How do we get this person off? Does anyone know how we get this person off? (LAUGHS) Stop. Wait, what's going on? Come on, Matias. You sneaky little bastard... No. No. No. He's playing us. It's still the game. Guys, do... Hey, listen, do not click the link. Is this the link? Do not click the link! Do you hear me? Uh, yeah, okay. SERENA: Guys, we didn't click the link, but the video's playing anyway. DAMON: Same here. What the... SERENA: What is it? That was senior year. That's December Dash at McCleary's Pub, yeah? This is so cool. SERENA: What does this have to do with it? NARI: I don't know. Wait, guys, where is Lexx? Oh... I don't know, she's probably still getting a bollocking from her mom. MATIAS: Lexx! What is that? That's drillbit. That's an exploit. What is an exploit? It's a hacking tool. Hacking? Lexx! Weird. (CHUCKLES) SERENA: Are you calling Lexx right now? MATIAS: Yes, I'm calling Lexx right now. SERENA: Wait, um, I thought she was... (RING TONE PLAYING) Where is she? AJ: Okay, I am... Is she in on this, Matias? What's going on? (LAPTOP BUZZES) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (LAUGHTER) (STATIC CRACKLING) (PEOPLE GASPING) (LOUD CRASH) (GIRL WHIMPERING) GIRL: Oh, my God! No! (NARI GASPING) Matias? Was that Lexx? MATIAS: Jesus. Matias, please, talk to us! AJ: This is the game. That wasn't her. (LAPTOP CHIMES) (CHAT ALERT CHIMES) (RINGING) (STAMMERING) Hey, hey, hey. Hey, how close are you? How close are you to the subway? (ALERT CHIMES) Hey, okay, can you do me a favor? Can you stay on the call? Just keep your phone in your pocket, or whatever. Just stay on, okay? (ALERT CHIMES) Just trust me, okay? And I'll explain it to you when you get here, all right? Wait, no, Nari, Nari, Nari, Nari, who are you calling? I'm calling Lexx. Don't. Please, do not call her right now, okay? Please, just don't... Straight to voicemail. Okay, guys. Hey, listen to me for a second, all right? No more calls, all right? We just... You can leave your phones on... Why? But just don't... There are automated calls, it's part of the game. I just wanna make sure that they're going through, you know? Bullshit, Matias. Bullshit, okay? I have had enough. No. I swear, if you don't start talking now. Matias is playing with you. No, no. I am calling the police. Nari, Nari, please, do not do that! Please, hang up the phone, Nari! No! I am not. I'm going to call the police right now! Calm down, guys! Calm down! Just give me one more second. Guys, it's real! The whole thing is real! Just listen to me, all right? The reason I said it was a game is because he said if anyone knew or if anyone is connected, he would kill Amaya and then he'd come after all of you. Who? Charon. Charon. Charon IV. The guy whose laptop I took. Okay, Matias, we get it. I'm kind of done with this now, all right? Can you shut up and listen to me, please? Please. He can hear and see everything, all right? He found Amaya's apartment. She was the first person I called, so he must have been able to track her somehow or I don't know. SERENA: Wait. (STUTTERS) Oh, my God. You're serious? You're being serious right now? She's on her way over here, and he's following her. DAMON: Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So there is no game, this is all actually happening? Oh, my God. He killed Lexx. (STAMMERING) No, I don't know. But he pushed her. He bloody killed Lexx! If he was with Amaya, then how could he have done that to Lexx? That's exactly... Here's the thing, it wasn't him. It must have been one of the others. The other what? The other... The Charons! The ones who buy the videos, the ones who pick the girls. They must have figured out that the laptop got stolen. Oh, my God, guys! They're not just gonna let that evidence float around! No, we saw all those videos. This is damage control. They're doing a cleanup. Hey, you guys. If they found Lexx, can they find the rest of us, too? I am ghosted online. They can't find me. No, guys... He's right, he's right. You guys all need to get to AJ's house. No! Wait! Do not... Any physical location they won't be able to trace. Please. If they are that good, they can track cell phones, they can track cars. Do not lead them to my place! Listen! Just, just listen to me, guys. You have to stay online and act like nothing is wrong. No, no, what we can't do is sit around and wait till someone shows up at our door. Wait. Wait, wait. How do you know he's not listening now? Because of... Because of Facebook chat. The green light, it goes off when she loses connection. That's why I told her to take the subway. So that when she lost connection, and when she went underground, then I can tell you guys what was fucking happening, all right? Look, there's no service in the station. But there's Wi-Fi in the subway cars. So as soon as she gets on that train, she's gonna have Wi-Fi again and so will he. All right? Let's just start... Can we just play a game, for the... In the meantime, act like nothing is happening? I'll give him the laptop when he gets here. Wait a second. If he's watching, if he saw what happened to Lexx, then doesn't he know? I don't know. He hasn't said anything yet, so he... It might have happened when he didn't have connection or... (DOOR OPENS) (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) Yo, AJ. AJ, AJ, dude, get the hell out of there. AJ, get out of there now. AJ, get out. Get out of there. AJ. AJ, get out! AJ. AJ, get out. Jesus Christ, Mom! What are you... (MATIAS SIGHS) All right, listen, I transferred all of the money, all of the money into my account, all right? Just temporarily. Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you try and warn us? How could I have warned you, Damon? If I did, Amaya would be... And I just did it as insurance, all right? Well, what about the laptop? Isn't that enough insurance? He's not gonna hurt Amaya when you've got... Not just Amaya! You've got all his evidence. Erica Dunne. I told him he would get the money back once I knew that she was free, too. (SERENA SIGHS) Matty, you are so dead. What the hell else was I supposed to do? You saw what he does to those people! What'd you think was gonna happen? You think he was just gonna take the laptop and walk away? I know what I'm asking you to do is... Amaya's gonna be here in five minutes, and I can't promise you that in those five minutes that no one else is gonna show up at your door, but... (SIGHS) Guys, if we don't do this, Amaya's... (LAPTOP CHIMES) Please. (LAPTOP CHIMES) Please. (INDISTINCT SUBWAY PA CHATTER) Okay. So, uh, who wants to go first? I'll go. No, that one sucks. (CHUCKLES) Um, "My gym teacher got fired for adding blank to the obstacle course." "Too much cocaine." "Velcro." Uh... "Depression." (CHUCKLES) I like Velcro. I thought depression was pretty good. All right, I'll go. Or do you wanna go, Damon? Yeah. Yeah, all right. I'll go. Yeah? Okay. Uh... Um... "In his new action, in his new action-comedy, "Jackie Chan must fend off ninjas "while also doing..." Hey, uh, Nari. Nari, we're trying to play. (ALERT CHIMING) Uh... "A horse with no legs?" Sorry. Sorry. What was the...? Right. "Going around punching people." Yeah. Yeah. You would pick that. That's a pretty good try. (LAPTOP CHIMING) Matias, give me access of laptop. System preferences, users and groups, add user, make sure you give me administrative access. Wait, I'm so... But what are you going to be doing? I'm gonna back up all the videos and I'm gonna go through location services in case we can find out where the laptop's been, then maybe we can find the missing girl. Wait, what do you mean? I'll be fine. Wait, don't worry, okay? What do you... What? No. You guys, my friend on the force, he's coming over here. (LAPTOP CHIMES) (TRAIN SCREECHING) Okay. "Blank: Awesome in theory, kind of a mess in practice." Um... "The swim team, all at once." (LAPTOP CHIMES) Okay, he's gone. AJ, AJ, AJ, as soon as Amaya gets to my place, you disconnect, and you and your mom get the hell out of your house. All right? You're the only one who might not be safe. Hey, look, Damon's in London, they can't get to him. And Nari's got a friend on the force, so the cops are already on their way. Okay, listen, you guys cannot stay there. No, no, no. We're not going to. Wait, wait, wait. Yeah, yeah. (LAPTOP CHIMING) (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENT ON PA) Um... Hey, uh... Amaya's gonna be late. She says there's something wrong with the subway. (STAMMERS) Can you guys play a little bit longer? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Um... Okay. Totally. Hey, uh, Serena? Serena, Nari. Serena? Guys? Hello? Uh, sorry, guys. Um... Nari's skipping this round. Uh...
