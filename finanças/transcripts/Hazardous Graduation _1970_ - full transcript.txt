A Nikkatsu Presentation Go! Hey! Run! Run! This site is currently under construction. We apologize for the inconvenience but safety is our first priority during our work sessions. We appreciate your understanding. Good! Bye! Wait! Isn't that Turd?? I have to ask him for this week's schedule. Turd!! Wait! Did I hear something? - Turd!! - Tell us! What is this? You've been watching too much TV. Turd! Tell me? Nobody says Turd. They excrete turds. See you then! Wait... Anyway, Turd aside, we pay you to be our manager. - Not nearly enough, though. - I don't care. Tell us what the schedule for this week is now! This week's schedule indicates that you get up at 6 AM and buy bread for 500 yen. Not that! This week's schedule! - This week's schedule... - Yes! - I don't know yet... - What is this? But I would like to share some surprising news with you. - Surprising news? - That's right. Don't be surprised. To advance our cause further, I've established a new group. You Shirobara high-schoolers, will be the leaders! As its manager, I, Unji Koishi, the boss of the Kamahara clan... Excuse me! What was that? - Salute! - Girls! You shouldn't hang out with weirdos. - You are still students. - We know, Miss. We are doing okay! Yay! Girls' Junior High School: Trouble at Graduation Japan Academy Production Group Producers: Yukio Sato & Kenzo Asada Screenplay: Gore Tanada Cinematographer: Shohei Ando Lighting: Yoshiaki Kimura Art Director: Hiroshi Fukatami Editor: Masanori Tsujii Music: Hiroki Tamaki assistant Director: Akira Matsuoka Starring: Junko Natsu Jiro Okazaki Oh Ranfan / Yuki Jono Masahiko Tanimura Isao Tamagawa / Mitsuko Tanaka Kan Yanagiya / Rumi Goto Hiroshi Tachikawa Reiko Arai / Toshiko Ikedo Yumiko Arizaki / Masami Haki Yumiko Kawahara Saburo Hiromatsu / Reiko Ono / Akemi Koromo Erika Tsuboi / Yasuko Ogura / Yasue Nishihara Kaji Morimoto Seizaburo Kawazu Keiko Fuji of the Record The Star of Enka Directed by Yukihiro Sawada Meeting in Progress Meeting in Progress What do you think will happen if we don't correct this? What do you think will happen if we don't correct this? What will happen to the school's reputation? We should fix it immediately. The mass media is abusing us. They act like this is about freedom of speech... Obscene Party in Broad Daylight In a Building under Construction Even High-Schoolers Involved! But actually they manipulate the facts significantly to stir up controversy. They don't think about their influence on society at all! How will Mika Shoji's appearance in the photo impact her future? As you guys know, Shoji is the granddaughter of the chief of police. I can't believe a child raised in a strict home would join in this disgusting partying! There must be some misunderstanding! I completely agree with your opinion on the mass media. Sex is a dignified thing. How dare they use it as a means of entertainment? If you don't enjoy sex, you are not human. In other words, the Age of Sex... Well... I, myself, sometimes forget that I am a teacher and get excited... Sorry for this! Is there anything we can do to control this? About that... The government gave our school the authority to teach students abstinence. We've implemented measures to correct physical and mental... relationships between boys and girls. And now, it's time for us to promote these measures further. I think that giving them immunization shots is great. But if you vaccinate them too much, they will become addicts. Especially middle schoolers. And it might make them mentally unstable. It's like waking up a kid who is sleeping quietly. Well... I don't think our middle-schoolers are sleeping quietly. Mr. Tayama... Don't you think you're too careless? But they know many things. What do you think, Mr. Kuni? They look good. They will be really great at... At what? Nothing... Who is she? The one who jumped just now. That's Kubota. Do you know the member of the committee? She looks great. Mr. Kuni! What are you looking at? Nothing... I just thought that being young is such a good thing. Is it? I haven't gotten married yet, though. No, I didn't mean that. It's okay. She was offended... Heave-ho! Chuko! Look at the window. Toad and Ghost are looking at us. They must be perving out again. Chuko! Ghost is supervising you, right? It's not that I asked for it. My mother asked him. Huh? Do you call Mr. Tayama Ghost? - Really? - You didn't know? You are so outdated. I once showed my boobs in a school on a summer day. - Actually, it was in front of my older sister! - Whoa, kinky! - Move! - Try me. Heave-ho! One, two... What are you doing? This no way for junior students to behave. Senior? So what? I've wanted to tell you... It seems you are trying to establish a group. How dare you? Unfortunately, we have more legitimate background than you regarding that matter. What? Our teacher, Ms. Sudo, and the head of the baseball club, Mr. Takeda, are supervising. In other words, it's an officially recognized group. Calm down. That's a dirty trick. Did you bring adults into this? They wouldn't like being screamed at by delinquents like you either. Are you done talking? We'll definitely settle this one clay! Do it if you can. Hiroko! Could you come for a moment? - What happened? - Mika is in the principal's office. - Mika? - Alone? No, with her aunt. Unfortunately, today's talk is over. Let's go check! Yes! Principal's Office Please understand the situation. That's right. That's exactly what you said. She is still developing, even mentally, but she thinks she is already a grown-up. I never thought that she was even close to being a grown-up. I never thought that she was even close to being a grown-up. Don't push? Don't push And all of sudden, the incident happened. Move, bitch! And all of a sudden, the incident happened. And all of sudden, the incident happened. When I was young, it was not like this. She is 4 months pregnant. Anyway, please don't forget that, starting now, parents' or... teachers' permission is required for boys and girls to have a relationship. I'm sorry that we failed to supervise her properly. Her father died, and her mother got married again. So I've been taking care of her. And now she got involved in this kind of shameful incident... Who are you? Have you been listening? Mika? What's so funny? - Nothing is funny here! - But... Mika! Stop it! Stop right now! Hey! Get out! Hurry! Get out! I apologize for Mika's incident. One of the relatives has been taking care of her. Of course, I will take care of the baby. The father is a problematic person. He is a weirdo who keeps saying he's from a yakuza family with a long history. I'm just glad that her name and her school's name have not been exposed. No way. I can't appreciate you enough. What? Excuse me... That's right. Do it that way. Shoji! I have a question! What? Are you really pregnant? Yes, it's true. Why? - Are you going to have an abortion? - That'd be ridiculous and wasteful. I will give birth to the baby. Really? Who is the father? Why does it matter? The baby is mine. If it's a boy, he will become a proper man. Wow! If the baby is a girl, she will become a hostess. We knew it! Mika! Let's go! See you. That's awesome. If it's a boy, he will become a proper man. If the baby is a girl, she will became a hostess. She is so cool! Oshima! Nice ball! You're awesome, Oshima! Awesome! Looking good! Hey! Write down the schedule! No, that's my wallet! You are very popular! I'm too! Hey! You! Do something! Coach! Oshima is very popular! Their eyes are glowing. Even Nagashima will cry in defeat in front of him. - Do something about the screaming girls. - Don't say things like that... They are big fans of Oshima. When they don't see Oshima, they can't sleep at night Focus on study, not on poop. That's what I'm saying. What kind of relationship do you have with Oshima? Oshima is my longtime friend. When I was a small kid, Oshima lived at a house three blocks away. We would play catch. He is more than an ordinary friend to me... Just make them quiet down! Even if he is nearly a pro-player, he is still a high-schooler. Hey! I'm here to encourage him to throw better... Oshima! Do your best! - Oshima! - You're awesome! Awesome, isn't he? Oshima! - How is his health? - It's great. Glad to hear it. Oshima! The middle-schoolers are here for you! The middle-schoolers have bad manners. - I agree. - Bad influence on him. Good job! Good job! Ouch! That hurt! That hurt! Tell me about it later, please. Understood. - Wait for a sec. - Sure. - Everyone! - Miss? Are you a fan of his too? It sounds a bit weird though. - Would you like to join the Shirobara club? - The Shirobara club? Yes. I've started a club for baseball fans and baseball club members. What kind of club? Well... Talk about difficulties in life and cheer them up. Innocent socialization between boys and girls. If I discuss personal matters with them, I will pass out. Miss! We are just fans, so we refuse that offer. Okay... Then don't disturb them anymore. Yes... Innocent socializing? Right... They will definitely talk about masturbation with horny eyes. - High-schoolers are the worst! - I agree! I'll tell you what relationships between boys and girls really are. - Sex, mainly... - Be quiet! Groper! Get him, please! You can't run away on a bus, bastard! I'll show you how manly I am! I'm Koishi, the 3rd generation of the clan! I'm Unji Koishi! Thank you! It's not that we want to cooperate with the police, but we hate gropers too. Miss! Even if this is your job, don't you get aroused if someone touches you? What a pathetic face! You don't have to thank me! You! If you don't behave properly around these girls... you'll be arrested for seducing minors! No way! The Structure and Functions of Frogs Genitalia As you can see, they reproduce and prosper. Structure / Genital (Female) As you can see, they reproduce and prosper. As you can see, they reproduce and prosper. They are absolutely relentless. As I've already mentioned, giving birth to a baby... is the result of the encounter between an egg and sperm. You understand, don't you? Is she really thinking that we are convinced? She can't grasp the reality because it's just a frog. It doesn't look like the male and female will ever meet. I can feel that she lost confidence. Does she ever menstruate? Even if you will graduate soon... giving birth to a baby should be something still far away at your age. I don't need to be more specific about this today. When you become an adult, you can ask the doctors who have expertise in this matter. She keeps her calm very well. Unimaginable future for her... Hey! Why is abstinence so important? A brand-new product sells for a higher price than a used one. But some used items are more valuable than brand-new ones. Who determines such values? - Men. - Are you sure? That's right. Right, Chuko? But that means women can't be independent. Be quiet! Please write your opinions on the questionnaire I'm passing around now. I will use it as sample data. Everyone gets a copy. The questionnaire was so lame. Do you have a boyfriend at the moment? What do you like about him? Do you know the meaning of the following word? PENIS Oh! No! Oh! No! MASTURBATION MASTURBATION Ugh! PETTING Stop it! Do you think she has ever had sex? It seems she has. If so, she should've told us about her experience. She just tries to deliver common-sense knowledge to us in a common-sense way. That's why she can't get aroused. It's nearly impossible for her to have a genuine orgasm. Forget it. Let's make our own samples. Experiment an Sexuality of Early Teens - Does that sound cool? - Cool! But how do we do it? Which are your erogenous zones and how aroused do you get? Options are 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0. 5 being the max. Sounds like a rocket launch countdown. How is it? Are you turned on? How is it? Are you turned on? How aroused are you? How turned on are you? 1?! How about now? 2?! And getting better to 3?! How about now? - To ten? - That turned on? Awesome! - How about you, Chuko? - No! That tickles! They are watching! I hate this. Everyone! Start marching forward! Are they kids? Or adults? What do you mean? Whether they have grown up... What do you mean? You really are outdated. Up to the 9th grade, girls mature faster intellectually and sexually than boys. Tell me more. There are exceptions. Kids like you shouldn't open their mouths. - What are you going to do? - It's not a big deal. I want to know how turned on you can get. Are you going to get turned on if I do something? Of course I will. Which part is going to get aroused? Could you show us? - Undress. - It's fine. What are you doing? Stop it! Get off me! Get off me! What are you doing? Get off me! Surprise! What have you been doing? It's not your business! Then why were you surprised? Anyone would've been surprised in that situation. You appeared out of nowhere, just like a ninja. I really hate female ninjas. These girls tried to take your cash, right? No, actually... We've discussed picnics. That's it. You are so shameless. You will definitely regret what you are doing now. If we are shameless, you must be ashamed of yourself. What did you just say? - Bye, Sister! Let's go! - Yes! They are here! You go! You are the expert! I don't want to. They are from the baseball club. No... I'm already turned on... This is a good chance! Let's find out who one gets more turned on, high-schoolers or middle-schoolers. No way... Teramoto is my neighbor. - It doesn't matter. - That's right. We should advance more boldly. That's what Dr. Kinsey said. - I don't want. I'm going home! - Hiromi! - You can't grow up with that attitude. - That's right. Let's go! Excuse me... Could you do me a favor? Anytime... What is it? I want you to help us with our homework. Your homework? It's too difficult to understand. - What should we do? - Go ahead. We can't say no to you guys... Please help us! Do you want us to do these? I'm serious. - I don't want to. - Furukawa! It seems interesting... How about you? - Yes. - I can't force you. We want you to join voluntarily. - But I'm the manager of the baseball club. - That doesn't matter. Please help us! Hormones / Masturbation Penis / Fetishism Homosexuality / Orgasm I want to go to the toilet for a sec. - Shut up, please. - I can't help it. Sorry. What are you doing? We have been doing a sexual experiment. I knew it. We've been following you because we knew it'd come to this. Why is it not allowed? I'm not saying that it's not allowed. I think you had good intentions in conducting that experiment. However, there is a thing called morals. People are supposed to behave according to more than just basic instincts. First, we come up with an ideal. And then, we strife to live up to that ideal. From now on, be more prudent and don't do careless stuff anymore. Understood? Did you get it? Everyone? We don't get it! Well... It's okay. We can sometimes do this for the adults! Cool! I'm hearing rumors that there's degeneracy in the air at this school. Or that a group of girls is doing some sexual experiment. I sure hope there is no one like that at my school. Strange rumors... - I'm so pissed. - Me too! - Arrogant bitches! - Who do they think they are? Toad and Sudo are behind this. I'm sure they spread the rumors. I think you had good intentions. I won't tell anyone because I don't want others to know. That's what he promised. This is why adults are not reliable. They are crazy. Look at your pathetic faces! Don't you like it? Everyone in our club has heard a lot regarding your dirty experiment. - Do you talk about that kind of stuff? - Of course. I've heard all the details from Furukawa. Right, Furukawa? You are really pathetic. Compared to discussing and fantasizing about sex... acting on your desire is more innocent. I'm not going to respond to that middle school-level argument of yours. Let's go! It's pathetic to see them act like good students. - Pisses me off! - Right. I've heard Hiroko is close to Teramoto. Innocent socializing between boys and girls? Is it true? Did you give your virginity to him? Don't say give, that sounds cruel. Half a year ago, Teramoto started helping me study. I knew it would turn out like that someday. I didn't know you had it within you, Kiyomi. - How romantic... - No! Fantastic! I think I'm pregnant with his baby. I'm not having my periods anymore. - Really? - What are you going to do? Have you talked with Teramoto? How about your family? I haven't talked to anyone. But I'm planning to have the baby, just like Mika. Have you seen a doctor? You should see one. If my family finds out, I... How about a hospital far away from home? Let's go! I see... It's been 2 months since your last period. However, to perform the check, I need a letter of agreement. So how should we proceed now... Just check if she is actually pregnant. That will do. I see... Of course, the cost of an abortion is about 10,000 yen. Are you saying that she needs to have an abortion? I'm just giving you information. More information is always better. This kind of case is actually common. Boys and girls become comfortable with and enjoy each other. Doctor! Doctor! I'm not the one! Her! I know it sounds rude but that looks ugly. - Sadako is like that too. - Who would like that? My sister told me the same thing. She got married two years ago. Now she already has 5 kids. - 2 years ago? - She had twins twice. She is the 8th. There she is... Let's go! Kiyomi! How was it? She is not pregnant. She has been dreaming... Dreaming? - In other words, Kiyomi... - Stop it! It's embarrassing! No! The doctor said it's not embarrassing, didn't he? It's an imaginary pregnancy. In other words, while she was sleeping, she did something unconsciously. And when she woke up, she thought it was a real event. That's it. Kiyomi is very innocent. Don't worry. I read in a weekly magazine that masturbation is not harmful at all. The proof is in her body. Nothing to worry about, right? That's why I'm sad. What an idiot... Wait, Chuko!? What are you doing here? We had some business here... - How's Mika? - She left the hospital today. Is the baby born? No, she had a miscarriage. She can conceive again, though. I knew it... I will visit the school soon. Where is the uncle? I don't know, maybe behind?! The fact that there was an orgy is just irreversible. He is a bit weird but has a good heart. Say hello to him. I'm Unji Koishi, the 3rd generation of the Kamahara clan. There is one boss and one subordinate in the clan. I've tried hard to rebuild my clan but I ended up leaving... despite the severe opposition of my father and mother. What do you think? Nice to meet you, everyone! What is all that for? Pack the luggage into the car right now! Yes! Come! Sorry! Sorry! You can get in as well. You'll have to squeeze in with the luggage, though. - Asa! - Yes! Sorry for letting you carry heavy luggage. Thank you for your service. What? Please take what your boss offers. It's fortunate that she miscarried her first baby. One baby or the other, they're not that different, right? What an attitude... I'm going to make a lot of babies. I will raise a boy as a yakuza to rebuild my clan. Clan? Yakuza are so old-school. You don't understand me. Shit! Hey! Chiko! You're right! There is Chiko! Chiko! Are you stupid? She won't respond to your call. Nobody knows we are here. Alright! Let's have a field trip to study society. A field trip to study society? That's right. Just shut up and follow me! Okay... Tonight's lesson is... Ouch! Are you trying to kill me? - Sorry! - Apology accepted... It hurts... Look! Keep working hard, you guys! Good! Good! The prologue is over! That'll be 50 yen each. I have to rebuild my clan. - Idiot! I couldn't see anything! - Is everything okay in your head? The car next to us just looks smaller than it is. What? Asa! You idiot! You are undermining our reliability! Do it properly! Find the right ones! Yes! Wow! Incredible! Very proper! Hey! Look! Look closely! Alright! The 1st session is over! Give me 50 yen each. I have to rebuild my clan. - The timing was perfect. - I feel like dying... I'm not satisfied yet. Fine! I will show something even better! - Hey! Asa! - Yes! It's really hard for me to cut it here... but if I continue, everyone will have a nosebleed. You understand, don't you? Just like that, a new life is born into a proper home. You should accept this dignified reality to the fullest and start a proper home. The word sex in English implies splitting one thing into two. Thus, boys and girls should be properly separated. They should only meet to create a new life. If you've already lost your virginity... Miss! Is it possible for a new baby to be born through car sex? What makes you say that? No reason... Unfortunately, I don't own a car, so I can't answer that. If you want to try, you could rent a car. It was different from her usual face, right? That's right, she looked embarrassed. But we are not there yet... We are not satisfied with this... Toad and Sudo were talking to each other. They are hypocrites. Hey! Hello! Don't come near us. You in a bad mood? Don't touch me! You are like a groper. Don't say such mean things! Right? A groper? It's okay, Furukawa. Don't talk to the kids. We are not kids! If you think we are kids, this is totally your misunderstanding! What's up? They are throwing tantrums. That's why you did a childish sex experiment? Playing doctor, was it? Okay, I'm going to show you proof that we are not kids. I want to see that. Right, Tera? Show us? What are you going to show us? We'll have a battle! Let's get out! What are you going to do here? I said I would show proof that I'm not a kid. I'll show you. - How are you going to do it? - It's obvious, isn't it? I will get naked. There is a saying that seeing once is better than hearing 100 times... You will catch a cold. You have to get naked too. Me? I don't want to! Get off me! No! No! I don't feel anything today. Hey! You have to undress like an adult! Undress! What are you doing? Stop it! Get off her! You and I... Let's see who turns him on first. - Officer! - Huh?! Run! Hurry! You! Wait! Hurry! Hurry! Wait! You are crazy! Aren't you ashamed? I voluntarily showed my body. So what? Even if it's your body, you're not supposed to show it in public! Why is it okay in a strip club, but not on a field? Be quiet! I can't let you go this time. Follow me to the police station! We can treat this incident more leniently, if you take responsibility. I'm taking full responsibility for the incident. Please show them leniency. However, even if there was no one to see them, we can't tolerate... them being naked in public like that and committing a misdemeanor. I think the students should take responsibility for what they did. To make that happen, sometimes it is inevitable to punish them. That sounds very harsh! They are still middle-schoolers. I mean, they are just kids! You teachers say that they are just kids. But they just demonstrated that they are not kids anymore. - Right, Sugihara? - Yes. At least, I can't say that they are still kids physically. Even if they are not kids physically, they are still mentally immature. Please forgive them this time. What's so funny? The chief is worried about you. Stop being rude! But... But? But what? The officer says we are adults and the teachers say we are kids. How can we know who is correct? To find out, you should get punished and reflect on your wrongdoings. I think so too. If the school is reluctant to punish you, we will do it. Announcement: The following students from Class 2, 9th Grade of Middle School are suspended indefinitely. - Things are going well. - Of course. - They are little perverts. - Indeed. The chief has to consider Mika Shoji's case too, so he is adamant. I'm considering expulsion at the moment. Thanks to you, we have to endure this embarrassment. This is so embarrassing. Why don't you think about your father's status for once? Suspension right before graduation? What if you get permanently rejected? It's impossible. Middle school education is compulsory by law. Listen to your mother! Even if you can't get rejected, they can expel you. What if you can't enter high school due to the expulsion? Isn't it better for you, Chuko? It's okay. I will work then. Who would hire a middle-school girl expelled from her school? Right, Mister? That's not an easy thing to do. I will work at a bar or a massage parlour. What did you just say? That's enough. Go over there. You should reflect on what you did. How childish! Don't I have to get a lesson from the teacher? You know it's not good timing. Lessons are off today. Great! Chuko! Mind your manners! I can't accept this! We have to deal with her more aggressively! How pathetic! I apologize... I'm sorry for all the problems she has been causing. I'm too embarrassed. Well... Her friends are the bad ones... Mister! Unfortunately, we have to leave now. Sorry. Please take care of her. Excuse me. Idiot... Idiot... Idiot... That's not beautiful... Suspension makes me feel down... Adults seem interested only in public stunts... I would prefer immediate expulsion to suspension. What would you do? I would work. As what? I've read a book called Women Overcoming Gender Roles. It's about the lives of women. What about that? I'll get a job that breaks the gender roles, like a fighter or a spy. Setsu! That's a good idea... Let's do it! We'll challenge the adults. How?v If we try hard, they will show weaknesses at some point. We have a lot of time anyway. Let's investigate their behavior. - Like a spy? - Cool! But if we really get expelled, we should move as a group. Even if we were born separately, we will die together. One, two, ya?! They are doing it... They are doing well... Hey girls! Let me join your group! Hey? What's going on? This is about the life of women. We won't be easy. Hey, I heard you got suspended. It's quite good, isn't it? If you feel down because of a suspension, you won't survive this tough world. Listen! Suspension is like a vacation between summer vacation and winter vacation. Again? Let's go.. My head has been suspended since I was born... My mother suffered a lot... Understood? Hey! - Sister! Could you talk with us? - Please. For us... Leave it to me... I don't know what's going on... Wait, Ghost is here. Hey! What's up? Well... What do you see? The principal? Gynecologist This and that. Everything is such a mess! This is nastier than I expected... I feel disgusted by them! I don't feel like returning to this kind of school. Should I quit before getting expelled? We promised that we would die together... He?! Everyone! Furukawa? - What about school? - I'm on suspension. - I got in some trouble. - You too? Sorry. It's my fault. It's okay. It's not your fault - What? - Then who... The police didn't say a thing to the school. But there was a tip from Shirobara school. I think Sudo is the culprit. Sorry, my teacher's fault. Still the same sad story. Be quiet! Blah blah blah blah! I've been listening... What? Stop being depressed just because you figured out your teachers' dirty secrets. You can't survive this world with that kind of attitude. Listen! The higher you go, the dirtier you become. Stop saying stupid things every time you find out about... the nasty night lives of politicians and executives. That's right! I forgot! I, Unji Koishi, the 3rd generation of the Kawahara clan... Wait for a second! That's not relevant! But he is right. Even if you don't go back to school, there are still ways for you to survive. Don't be so pessimistic! The weather is so good today! I'm going to take everyone somewhere great. Wait! Where are we going? Where to? That place! My childhood friend is having a conceit in a hall. Do you have a childhood friend? Of course, idiot! Don't be surprised! Keiko Fuji! Keiko Fuji? That's right, the enka singer. We've been friends since birth. - You are useful for once! - Awesome! Alright! Let's go! Nippon TV Public Broadcasting The Star of Enka with Keiko There she is! It's me! The Star of Enka Keiko will be so pleased to see me! Oh! Don't make a mess! Don't make a mess! I will deliver them to her for you! I just want to hang out for a sec! Keiko! How can you do this to me? That was unfortunate! Dig in! I will leave the hotdog car here. But what if the officer comes? We are minors... Don't worry. I will handle it for you. You already have the general idea, right? You can survive independently. Hey, Chuko! I think I will become a sauna masseuse if I get expelled. In a sauna? I can introduce you to a good massage spa. Wait! Isn't that Oshima? I didn't know you would do this, Oshima. You idiot! Darling... Oshima hangs out with those girls every night. Yes. - Ah, disappointing... - He's like a fallen angel... I can't let him do this... Stop it! I'm going to the toilet. I haven't gone to the toilet in 2 days. Western style toilets are weird. Ouch! My wallet! Hey! I need help! Announcement: The suspension on the following students from Class 2, 9th Grade of Middle School has been lifted. Lifted He summoned them here. He should've expelled them. He just couldn't do it because of a personal matter. I feel a dark force invading the school. To protect the school's dignity, I should expel you. But I have to consider the issue of expelling you right before graduation. As an adult with the obligation to discipline you, I want to avoid that. I've talked with the teachers several times. We've concluded that we have to give you the opportunity to graduate. You should show your gratitude to the teachers. Understood? Well... I don't really feel like showing gratitude. Me neither. I'm not convinced. This is like he is threatening expulsion right before graduation. But we can still graduate. We really have to keep a low profile for now... in order to get the graduation certificate and the cake. He can't let us go because he needs good reputation to win the elections. Elections? I'm not 100% sure about this information yet. Should I ask? Maybe I could meet him in the sauna? In the sauna? Please wear sunglasses when you use the tanning roam. The guests who come out of the sauna drink cold drinks here. So you have to serve them. Understood? Welcome. Hello. - Hey, you! Come here! - Yes! Hey, hey! She is the woman between Tayama and the principal. She took money from the principal. Your great skill helps a lot... Are you the interns? Yes! Thank you for the training! If Yashiro gets elected, everything will go well. It's been hard until now. We have lots of strong competitors left and right. What are you talking about? Just a rumor. I've heard that some funds were delivered to you... to help you build this Amazon sauna. Stop it, please. What if strangers thought it was true. This kind of things happens a lot. Yashiro is a politician with good skills anyway. That's right. Had the girls been expelled, the media would have taken on the chief as well. The chief is also in trouble with his subordinate. Fortunately, my daughter was saved because of that. Father! You! Why are you here? Hey! Wait a sec! Wait! I'm shocked! But I've never seen him make that kind of face before. I feel a bit sorry. Whatever. I wonder if what they said about the principal is true. He lifted our suspension to help his own election. That means he wants problematic students to leave the school. Should I say how sweet he is? Disgusting! Wait! Are you going to scold us again? If you want... But this might be the last time I see you. Won't we see you anymore? That's right. I'm transferring. It's unfortunate that I will not be able to scold you again. Miss! Are you transferring because of us? I've requested harsh punishment for you to give you an idea... about the responsibility you should assume as an adult. The chief initially agreed with my request... but things have changed. Is that why you are transferring? I think it's because of my opposition. But I won't think that way. You can prove whether my judgment was right with your own actions. I won't give you a long speech now. Bye. I think she got forcefully transferred. I used to find her annoying though. Being fully understood by an adult feels good. Young and old people should understand each other. The principal must have forced the chief to transfer her. Alright! I won't let them play the game as they want. What are you going to do? We will regret it forever if we graduate like this. So what are you going to do? Do it one more time. One last shot. Graduation I hope everyone will live happy lives in the future. I'm going to end my speech with this. March 20, 1971 Head of Education Committee Ichitaro Tsuchigra Next is Tomohisa Yashiro with a farewell speech to the graduates. Dear 22nd-year graduates! Congratulations! Dear parents and relatives! Congratulations! Today, everyone here is graduating from Shirobara School... to an upper level school or to society for a new life! However, society might not readily accept every single one of you here as you expect. Awesome! If you face difficulties like that, please remember... what you've learned during your 3 years at this school. I have no doubt that the memories of your time at Shirobara School... based on innocence, integrity and tolerance will definitely soothe... the exhaustion and encourage you in the end. I'm a person with the obligation to discipline you all. - And I would like to... - ...let my lover run a sauna! The money was embezzled from the funds for a new school building. Everyone! Please remember, your tolerance is very important! That's ridiculous! Be quiet! Mr. Matsui! Hurry! Hurry! Stop! Stop this! Stop it! Mr. Endo! Make them stop! Hey! Endo! Now! Hey! Principal! You are misunderstanding the situation! What is this about? Mr. Yashiro! What is all this about during graduation? What? We are not just cute girls! We reject the adults' innocence-integrity-tolerance speech! Everyone! I feel extremely sad that you caused embarrassment like this... during graduation, which is supposed to be a dignified event! I will never allow anyone to harm the school's reputation! You are particularly disrespecting the names of those teachers... who let you graduate despite your issues. I don't care! No big deal! Let me go! Stop touching me! - Stop it! - Stop it! Stop the violence! Stop it! Stop messing up the graduation! My school, my election... It's all over! One more! Yay! The light of fireflies and the falling snow... Dear Class 2, 9th Grade of the Shirobara Middle School! Congratulations on Your Graduation! Unji Koishi, the 3rd Generation of the Kamahara Clan. - Your singing sucks! - Sorry... Hey! Hey! I'm Unji Koishi, the 3rd generation of the Kamahara clan! Hey! What's this? Protect the flowers! Hey! Yay! The End
