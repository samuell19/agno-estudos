- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Your father's death has been a terrible shock, Nancy, to all of us. But it is a comfort to know that he's left you financially secure. John, I'd rather not discuss financial problems now. I don't know whether you know it or not, but just a few weeks ago, George and I, as senior and junior members of the firm, respectively, took out several insurance policies, each naming the other as beneficiary. Which means that I can carry on our business without interruption... ...and protect your interests as George's heir. Nancy, you're not listening. Frankly, John, I wasn't. Well, I'm quite sure it's practical, the insurance and all of that but... I just can't seem to think about those things now. John, what I can't understand is why the papers... keep referring to the fact that Dad had been drinking heavily... ...the night of his accident. He didn't drink that much, you know that. Apparently he had been drinking. There seems to be no doubt that he stumbled and fell down the stairs. He must have had worries that none of us knew about. We all of us have worries we try to keep hidden from those we love. Call me if there's anything you need. Thank you, John. Malone, I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I didn't realize what time it was. The funeral, you know. What's on your mind? Look out they don't bounce up and hit you on the face. These checks? Just hold them for a while. Listen, Hammond, I run a gambling joint, that's part of my business. And I don't want any bum checks passed by you or anybody else. I told you a week ago to stop writing IOU's on the house until you had the money. So what do you do? You put your name on these worthless pieces of paper. Why, those checks are chicken feed compared to what we've got coming. In a few weeks I can pay you ten times that much, you know that. Okay, but until then, don't write any more checks in my place... ...on money that you're going to get. The money is as good as in my hands right now. Look, in my business you believe it when you see it. I just want to know that I'm gonna be breathing down your neck... ...until I see that insurance money. You say when the two men, Sullivan and Hammond, placed their firm's insurance with us, Sullivan was just as anxious to have it as Hammond? That's right. It was the junior partner's idea. But when I started to write up the policy, the senior partner raised the ante. Double indemnity. - $100,000, that's a lot of money! - What can we do about it? According to the police it was an accident, unexpected. Do you know how many unexpected accident claims we've paid off recently? And all of them in this district. Listen. Stella Calhoun, automobile accident, car overturned, burned, $50,000, double indemnity. Sam Spizer, fall from a rig, $65,000, double indemnity. Keith Watkins, gas-leak explosion, $20,000. And all of these policies, like Sullivan's, taken out shortly before the deaths. - Well, I'll admit it doesn't sound good. - You know, this could be a racket. Well, I can't vouch for the Sam Marlowe claim. But Sullivan and Hammond are certainly responsible citizens in our town. Oh, how far does that go these days? With guys on the loose... that would cut their own grandmothers' throats if it only paid off in milk tokens. I'm going to hold up this claim, I've got a hunch. I'm going to put our best investigator on this, see what he comes up with. Get me Tom Davison. If Davison doesn't come up with something, well... Mr. Hammond's firm is going to be richer by a thousand dollars. - Miss Sullivan is in the living room, sir. - Thank you. - Mr. Davison? - Good morning, Miss Sullivan. - I'm sorry I'm a few minutes late. - It's all right, won't you sit down? Thank you. Well, first I've just want to say how very happy we are... ...that you've consented to give our company your full cooperation. Well, it's just a matter of routine, isn't it? Um, not exactly. You see, in this case the claim is rather a large one... ...and it will require thorough investigation. So I'm afraid I'll have to ask you a few questions. Several of them concerning your father's partner, John Hammond. John? Why, I've always considered him like one of the family. His wife died a few years ago and he never married again. I see, then he's known your father for a long time. Oh... twenty years. Oh, but surely your company isn't concerned about John Hammond. Oh, I don't mean to imply that, Miss Sullivan, but... We feel that your father's accident might not have been purely accidental. Not accidental? Then you... you mean he didn't fall. Well, let's look at the facts. Your father worked late quite often. Yes. And according to the reports he'd been drinking so heavily... ...that he fell down the stairs. That's just it. I'd never known him to drink that much before. Oh? That's what I can't understand about the whole thing. I told Mr. Hammond that, but he said the facts prove otherwise. I see. About the elevator. The company says it was a fairly new one, not defective. The janitor says he wasn't in the building at the time of your father's death. In fact we can't find anyone who was in the building... ...except your father and he walked down the stairs. It's an automatic elevetor, Mr. Davison. He'd never walk unless it were out of order. And if it were temporarily in use, he'd wait for it. That's the way we feel about it, Miss Sullivan, ...and that's one of the reasons I'm here. Now perhaps we can clear up the unhappy circumstances... ...of your father's death, but I'll need your help. In what way, Mr. Davison? I'd like to establish closer contact with the Sullivan Hammond Company. And it might be better if it were not in my position as an investigator. Will you cooperate with me? Yes, I'd be glad to. I understand how you feel, Miss Sullivan. I appreciate your help. So Tom thought he'd leave Atlanta for greener fields. Yes, sir, with palm trees and orange blossoms. You're a cousin of Nancy's on her father's side? Um, no, sir. Nancy's mother and my mother were sisters. Have you ever been to California before? Oh, I've tried and tried to get him to come out here, but you know how difficult it is to pull up stakes. Well, we'll give you a chance, Tom. - Why, thank you, sir. - Have you ever sold real estate? - Um, Yes, sir, but not commercial. - He's a very good salesman, John. Well, at least he tells me he is. Or so I've been told, sir. We don't have an office for you at the moment, but one of our men is leaving next week and you can have his. Jerry, I'm sending Tom Davison in to see you, he's going to be with us. Jerry Hatcher is our head salesman, he'll show you the ropes. Fine, sir. For the present, you'll share an office with our accountant, Addie Wilson. I certainly appreciate this opportunity, Mr. Hammond, sir. I know I'll be successful. Thank you, John. Good luck, Tom. - See you later. - Thank you, Nancy. Hatcher's office is just down the hall to the left of the elevator. Thank you, Mr. Hammond. Addie, I'm putting Nancy's cousin in your office temporarily. - Why pick on me? - Now don't fuss, I know what I'm doing. Play up to him if you have to. For heaven's sake use diplomacy. I hate snooping relatives. Even under the best conditions they're tough to take. Maybe this won't be so tough. - Addie, this is Tom Davison. - I know. - Miss Wilson. - It's a pleasure, ma'am. - I'll leave him to you, Addie. - Wonderful. I mean, I've been expecting Mr. Davison... and anticipating it. I'll go over the rental list with you later. Well, thank you, Mr. Hatcher. This will be your desk, Mr. Davison. They'll plug in a private phone for you tomorrow, but, um... I'm here all day and if there are any messages while you're out, - I'll be very glad to take them for you. - Oh, that would be fine. Now let's see if I've left anything of mine in here. In case of rain. Imagine rain in California. If there's anything you want to know, just ask me... anytime. Thanks. I've been with the firm a log time and I know everybody's secrets. Thank you, Miss Wilson. If there's ever anything I need to know, I most certainly will ask you. That was a delightful dinner, Tom. Well, I'm certainly glad you enjoyed it, Addie. I just hope I didn't ask too many questions concerning the Sullivan Hammond Company. Oh, not particularly. You're Nancy's cousin and she's part owner, so it's only natural that you'd want to know how solvent the company was. Well, actually, she wanted me here to sort of protect her interests. You see, ever since Uncle George died, she's been somewhat concerned. Concerned, about what? Hammond's business ability. Several of the older employees feel that he isn't too capable. That in another year os so there may be no company at all. Oh, that's ridiculous. Someone's envious of course. They say it wasn't Uncle George but Hammond who's been doing the heavy drinking. How vicious can they be? I'm surprised at Nancy believing all that rot. She knows John Hammond's not like that. Of course I knew Mr. Sullivan better. I was his secretary before I became firm accountant. Well, let's not talk about business. That's not what this date was for. - Wasn't it? - No. It was for dinner, dancing... Powder your nose, honey, it's shining. I love observant men. This fell out of your purse, honey. Oh. It's amazing how a little powder and paint does fortify a woman. Now I'm ready for anything. That's what the Iroquois indians always said... ...just before a massacre. Well, this is it such as it is. Why, this is fine, Addie. I think an apartment is the poorest excuse for a home. Make yourself at home while I... ...while I fix you a drink. What will you have, scotch or bourbon? A little scotch, please, with soda. Why haven't you ever bought yourself a home, Addie? Well, you know, alone, no one to love, no one to love you. You just don't have the incentive. Oh now, Addie. I hope you like this scotch, it was a gift. - Your mother? - Yes. - Here's... - No toast. Just to our continued friendship. That is a marvelous toast. Good morning, Miss Nancy. There were several messages at the office that you'd called. I'm afraid I'm going to recommend that they fire you... ...if you don't stay on the job, my southern cousin. And you can drop the accent, we're alone. Okay, but I have been on the job. - I had a date with Addie last night. - Oh? - Pleasant occupation. - Could be. Look what I found in her apartment. "To Addie, my one true love, John." That's strange, I... I never remembered Dad speaking of Addie and John knowing each other so intimately. Yes, she lied to me about that. And where there's a lie, there's a lead. And that could be it. It is rather surprising, but do you think it could mean anything more than that? That's what I hope to find out. Tom, the reason I've been trying to call you is because I... I'm giving a dinner party tonight and... although I know it's not in your curriculum, but all work and no play and... Well, whatever the rest of that saying is... But anyway, you know what I mean. Will you accept? I'll bet you could repeat that speech. Oh yes I could, I've been rehearsing it for an hour. I appreciate the invitation, but I'm afraid I can't accept. - I have to work. - Work? Tonight? Yes, you see, I have... a dinner engagement... with Addie. Hm, you are getting in a rut. I wouldn't say t's entirely unproductive. - Don't you ever relax? - Occasionally. May I have a rain check on that dinner date? - All right, you have it. - Thanks. Well, I have to list an apartment in this neighborhood, I'd better be on my way. Wouldn't it be a strange switch if you turned out to be a high-powered real estate man? Sort of a jack-of-all-trades, you mean? Well, you seem to be pretty versatile. Oh, there must be an answer to that. I'll try to figure it out and have it when I cash in... ...my rain check on that dinner date. Okay, start thinking. Oh, um... I'll keep you posted on my progress with Addie. I can hardly wait. I know he read that insurance card that dropped out of my handbag. What do you suppose he thinks he's run on to? Well, whatever it is, it's beyond the snooping stage. People just don't steal photographs unless they're collector items. Well, that picture of me was a collector's item. Hope he doesn't show it to anyone. Seems to me, John, that you're taking all this very lightly. You know it's quiz kids like him that come up with all the answers. I know. Don't worry, he won't get far. But I wish he'd stayed in Atlanta. I'm not going to let a kid like that wreck my future. Our future. Remember, darling. We're in this together. - Hello. - Hello, Mr. Hatcher? This is Davison. Say, do you know a Charles Malone around town here? Malone? Sure, he's a local gambler. The, er... Night Hawk on First Road. Not at all, Davison, any time. Right. Well, how about lunch some time? All right, fine, I'll call you. Goodbye. - Another woman in your life? - Could be. I see you can't trust any man. Oh, your mother was certainly right when she said that, wasn't she, Addie? Oh, Tom, I'm sorry, I have to break our dinner date tonight. - The boss wants to talk business. - Oh, I' sorry to hear that, Addie. I was looking forward to it. Call another gal. You've been in town long enough to know a few. Good idea, listen to this. - Hello? - Hello, this is Tom! Is that dinner still on? Yes, but... I thought you were working tonight. Well, so did I, but the deal fell through. What's the matter, are you slipping? Oh, I hope not, but you know how it is, sometimes yes, sometimes no. Oh, I wish I could say I'm sorry but I'm not. However, I'm afraid it's too late for dinner because I've already invited someone else. You know, you do have to plan dinner parties. Oh, I understand. How about lunch today? Oh, I'm sorry, Tom, but I really don't think I could make it. It's after twelve now and I couldn't possibly be ready before two. And that of course is too late for me. Well... goodbye. - No luck? - No luck. Too bad. - How about lunch? - Too late. - For you too? - Uh-huh. - I am a social failure. - It would seem so. The elevator's stuck in the basement. Sometimes the elevator is no good. I'll go see. - We'll both go. - Alright. If there's anything wrong with that elevator, I want it fixed before there's another accident around here. Yes sir, Mr. Hammond. What are you doing? What's the idea of holding up the elevator service? Well, you see, Mr. Hammond, both Nancy and I have been very curious... about why the elevator might not have been working... ...the night Uncle George was killed. And I think I may have the answer. Look here. - I don't get it. - I think I see. If the wood she stay in the elevator door, then the elevator she stay in the basement. And she's no push up. That's right, Tony, the elevator no push up. Well... Sounds a little farfetched to me. I hope that you turn out to be a better real-estate salesman... ...than you are a detective. It's nearly seven, John. Are you about ready to leave? Not quite, dear. You run along. I'll join you at Sherry's in about an hour. Okay, I have a couple of packages to pick up. I'll get a table. What's making you so nervous, John? I called San Francisco today. The insurance company's main office. - And? - I talked to a man named James, Russell James. The claim is still being held up. Now don't imagine things. I'm sure it's only routine, just red tape. I tried to get him to tell me approximately when it would be paid. All he would say was slight delay. Now with this cousin here snooping around... Suppose he runs into something really damaging. When he gets in our way, we'll take care of him. If he goes to the police with his suspicions about the elevator, who knows. I have no intention of losing $100,000. Neither have I. And we're not going to. Take it easy. I'll see you later. - Good night, Tom. - Good night, Addie. - Working late? - Oh, about another half hour. I think I have a rental for that building on 4th and Central. - Hanging around for a call. - That's fine. I'm leaving in a minute. Will you see that all the lights are out before you go? - Yes, sir. - Economy, you know. Good night, sir. The elevator shaft, someone just fell down the elevator shaft! Are you sure? Yes, I was down the hall and I heard someone scream. - Go call an ambulance, I'll go downstairs. - Right. Couldn't have been Addie, could it? She was the only one here in the office tonight besides you and me. Operator. Amabulance service, emergency. Sullivan Hammond realty building, Spring St. Hurry. Shall I wash it for you while you're in there, Mr. Wallace? Yeah, use a little Albo grease, this time. Yes sir! Fireworks today, boy, they're all in there now. Park it over there behind Hammond's car. I'll wash it when I get the chance. So now look what you've done. Killed a dame... ...and brought every cop in town to your office again. - Hi, Duke. - You and your big shot talk. I told you when you yapped about that Davison kid to lay off, didn't I? But he knew something, Malone, I'm sure he was going to the police. Rags, I told you not to use my private phone. Okay, Mr. Malone. So everything was okay. You had the situation right on the palm of your shaking hand. Well that's the trouble with amateurs. Never figure out the next move. Alright, now this I want to know. What are you going to do when the cops really start hammering at you? This morning was nothing. Wait till they begin breaking you, what are you going to tell them? I don't see that that's a problem, I'll simply stick to my conviction that the elevator was defective. - The police don't suspect anything. - Listen to this. "Wilson death elevator not defective." "Police believe elevator safe." One day the cops may seem dumb, the next day they're smart. But too much has happened in the Sullivan Hammond Realty Corporation... ...for an insurance company to ever pay off. Nobody's got anything on me. It was your idea to insure this Sullivan for that dough and then have him knocked off. That's a lie, it was yours. So I went along with you, I did the dirty work, I had the guy knocked off. You're double-crossing me, Malone, you know why it was done... You forced me because of that gambling debt I owed you. And look at the cut I was getting, not even half. You and that Wilson dame were getting two thirds. I got employers to pay. Now we may not get anything, none of us, due to your stupid interference. Please, Malone, lay off, will you? You don't understand. What, that you fouled up the deal? No... that I can't stop thinking of Addie. Alright, boys, take him home. - I can get home alone. - Well then all of you, beat it. But Duke, you stay. - When did you start packing this? - Why, I... Better let me keep it. We don't want anything to happen to you yet. We'll work it out some way, Hammond. But from now on keep your mouth shut. Guys like that squeal sooner or later. Guilty conscience, martyr stuff. He's gotta be made to keep quiet, one way or... Or the other, I know. So what happens to our share of the hundred-grand insurance dough? That's the trouble with this racket. Too much chance. Now you take the stock market. It says here... Don't read out loud while I'm thinking. That insurance company will never pay off now. ...without investigating plenty and that we can't have. It's better to pass up that dough than put ourselves on the hot seat. Yep, that's what my old lady would call the lesser of two evils. Yeah, yeah... We're all set on that Marshall deal, aren't we? All set. Played along with us and took out the policy just like you figured. Good. We'll get rolling on it. Pays less dough but it's a lot safer. And there won't be any John Hammond to cut in. Any place special in mind for dinner? You mean we can go any place I want to? Hm-hmm, your evening. There's a wonderful spot up the coastal ways. Hangs over a cliff. Big glass windows looking out to sea... ...to a real far place. It's cozy. There's a beautiful moon tonight to go with it. How well did Hammond know Malone? I don't... What does that got to do with what I was saying? Hm? Wh... what were you saying? I was just saying... Wouldn't it be nice to go to a drive-in and have a hamburger? That's a wonderful idea. I love hamburgers! - With onions no doubt? - Yeah, big Bermudas! It's your evening. I just want to sun up to my office for a minute. Another minute? I won't be long. Here, time it. Ten minutes at the most. - And then we'll have dinner. - You said that exactly an hour ago. Well, we're a little behind schedule. But I'll make it up to you... cousin. Well, for once you're ahead of time. Aren't you going to congratulate me? - Congratulations. - Thank you. Slim did a swell job writing this note. The guy's got talent. Operator, 27. What happened to my call to San Francisco? No, no, miss, Russel James, J-A-M-E-S. The Cosmopolitan Insurance Company, Market 70465. That's right. Hello, James? Davison. Here's a follow-up on this morning. He was killed with his own gun. I just talked to the chief. Hammond purchased the gun only a few weeks ago. Right here in town. Well, according to the coroner and the San Marino cops, it's a closed case, but I'm not so sure. There are a couple of things that just don't add up. You mean my hunch was right, it looks like a racket to you too? That's right, there was a gambling angle in that Los Angeles case. I thought so. Have Sam check the files and see if there was a gambler named Charles Malone, M-A-L-O-N-E mixed up in it. And call me back when you get the dope. Right. Come in. - Tom. - Nancy! Oh, Tom... I can't understand how John could have done this. In my experience people usually do such things from desperation. What do you mean? Well, apparently Hammond had been gambling quite heavily. And needed that insurance money to pay his debts. But why would he kill himself? Well, when my company held up the claim, evidently he couldn't pay off. And when that happens, gamblers get tough. Then maybe you think it... it wasn't suicide? That's right. I've got to do some more checking before I'm sure. Tom, last night while I was waiting for you, Two men drove into the parking lot. When they saw me, they... they got back into their car and... ...drove away again. - Could that mean anything? - Possibly. Would you be able to recognize them if you saw them again? Yes... yes, I think I would. Hello. Right. Looks as if you might be on to something, Tom. Malone was tied up with that Los Angeles case. Good. Now things are beginning to add up. I'll keep you posted. - Have you got a date for tonight? - No. Well you have now. We're having dinner together, Miss Nancy, at the nicest... Tom, look. Those are the two men I told you about. - Are you sure? - Yes. You think they'd recognize you? I don't think so, it was pretty dark last night. - Good evening. - Good evening, sir. - Table for two? - Yes, sir. - I beg your... - Jimmy! Nancy! How are you, darling? You know, you're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I'll see you later. Well, is that a habit of his? It's beginning to be one. - Who is he? - Jimmy Marshall. Owns an automobile agency in town. I'd say he's beginning to drink himself into bankruptcy. Duke, Mr. Malone wants to see you in his office right away. Are you looking for something, Mr. Marshall? - Can't find my stub. - You didn't have a hat. That's right, I didn't have a hat. Didn't have a hat, didn't have a hat... Hey, Jimmy, hadn't you better let one of the boys drive you home? Nope. I'll just point that little old car of mine toward home and say, "Scat!" It'll drive me there. Tom... Tom, he shouldn't be allowed to drive that way. Don't worry, honey, I'll see what I can do. Would you show the lady to a table, please? - Yes, sir. - No. No, thank you, I'd rather wait. I'll be right back. Come on, Nancy, we have to leave. - You must have got a sudden call. - I did. - I bet you're a doctor. - Yes, ma'am, excuse us, please. - I'll bet it's a baby case. - I hope it's a boy. What's the matter, didn't you like the decorations? - Doctor, baby case. - Oh, good luck, Doc. Thank you, son. Are you sure you know where Jimmy Marshall lives? Yes, on Magnolia, we're almost there. Tom, look! - It's your friend Jimmy all right. - I was afraid this would happen. Tom, he couldn't have been driving that car, you told me you saw those men throw him in the back seat. That's right, so it's a cinch he didn't get here by himself. He looks pretty bad. Go back to that gas station we passed and call an ambulance. The insurance man answered one of my questions. Jimmy has an accident policy, $25,000, double indemnity. Made out to a habberdasher, supposedly a pal of his. Well, couldn't that be possible? - It's possible but not probable. - Tom, Jimmy doesn't have any family. - Neither do I. - You don't need one. Oh, but I do need love and affection. Tell me, Mr. Davison, do you always mix homicide and heart interests? - Hm, I've been known to. - Uh-huh, that's what I thought. Drop me off at Wallace's Habberdashery. And while I'm in there, go to the address on this card... ...and pick up the wire recorder I ordered. Then go on to the hospital and I'll meet you there. Um... yes, sir. - Good luck, - Thanks, Nancy. - I'll see you ate the hospital. - Right. - Oh, good morning, sir. - Hi. Are you the owner here? - Uh-uh, I just work here. - Well, is the owner around? - Yeah, you wanna see him? - If I may, sir. Okay. - Did you want to see me? - Yes, sir. I'm Tom Davison, I was, um... one of the persons who found Jimmy Marshall last night. I know, I read the papers. Well, just before Jimmy became unconscious, he asked me to give, um... um... Duke Wallace, a pal of his, a message. - Are you Mr. Wallace? - Yeah. Well, he said that in case anything should happen to him, that you'd be paid off. I hope I got it right, sir. Does that make any sense to you? - Is that all? - Yes, sir. Johnny! Yeah, Duke? The gentleman didn't find what he was looking for. We'll have a better selection next week. Yeah, mister, we'll have a better selection next week. - Why don't you stop around? - Well, thank you, sir. - Good day, sir. - Good day. How do you like that punk Davison? Giving me a message from Marshall. - Who does he think he's kidding? - Maybe Hammond was right about him. Yeah, now he's beginning to get in my hair. Don't worry about him now, we've got to take care of Marshall first. Will you tell me why everything's blowing up in our faces? Jimmy'd be dead if that jerk hadn't found him. And another thing. How come he showed up at the scene of that accident last night? Not a coincidence. Get a load of this. The doc says Jimmy's got a slim chance of living. And if he lives, he'll talk. And I'm not gonna have anything mess up this deal if I have to tear that hospital apart. It's time he was out of there. Then there was a terrific pain somewhere in my head. And I... I woke up here. In the hospital. Sorry, Mr. Davison, you'll have to leave now. All right, nurse. Thanks a lot, Jimmy. Just take it easy and you'll be out of here in no time. Jimmy. Jimmy! Come on, get back! You're too late. The guy's right. Get the recorder. Jimmy. Jimmy. Nurse! Nurse! Nurse, hurry, please! When I took his pulse it was weak but not critical. Nurse, what's happened to Mr. Davison? He wouldn't have left without me. The recording machine's gone. And I know he wouldn't have left without taking this. Is there any other way out of this building? He'd have to pass the reception room. Perhaps you didn't notice him. He knew I was waiting for him. I'll have to notify the superintendent. If you'd like to come with me and talk to him. Yes. Thank you. Help! Help! Let me out of here! I can't... Why, Mr. Spangler. What happened? Oh... thank you, Miss Pringle. Another minute and I would have died. I was just collecting the soiled laundry down at the end of the corridor... ...when two men grabbed me. Oh, it was awful. One of them hit me over the head and threw me in here. - Were they in white uniforms like yours? - I think so. - With a laundry hamper? - I don't know. Maybe they took mine, I had one. Slight abrasion, nothing serious. The superintendent isn't going to like this. Well, neither did I! Where's the recording you took? I certainly wish I knew, sir. No, let it play. Maybe what he took is on the end of the roll. I've been gambling and drinking heavily at Malone's. When I finally got into such debt, I mortgaged the business. But... that didn't stop my gambling. I ran out of cash. Malone said he'd not only cancel my gambling debts, he'd make me a loan. But he needed collateral. To protect his loan, he suggested I take out an insurance policy... ...making Duke Wallace beneficiary. I was desperate. Well, the night you saw me when I was so drunk, the last thing I remember was being dragged from the back seat of my car... ...and shoved into the front seat. Nothing on this one either. - Search him. - But I have no other recording. Search him. Get 'em up, all of you! Look, Davison, can't we talk this over? What would you like to talk about? Insurance? Maybe you'd like to take out a policy on me... ...and then bump me off like you did the others. You're talking to the wrong guy, Malone. Go ahead, take a look at it. And leave the dough alone. Get me the police. Police? Oh. Yes, sir, right away. Get this. A guy in Malone's office asking me to call the cops. Oh, somebody clowning. Who was it? I don't know. I didn't recognize his voice. Hey, maybe there's trouble. So, I'll take a look. Anybody in here call the cops? Take a look. Cousin Tom's identification. Well, what do you know? Miss Nancy's Sullivan's crony cousin from Atlanta... a special investigator. The kid's a genius. Now it's my turn to do some investigating. Just what did you mean by insurance policies? Tell Malone Chief Meyers wants to see him. - Why, I don't know, officer, if he's in. - Find him! Yes, sir. Chief Meyers is here to see Mr. Malone. Oh. Yeah. Sure. He's not in his office but they'll try to locate him. Throw him in that hamper. Get him out of here fast. They can't prove that he was here or that we ever saw him. Stall the cops until we're out of the parking lot, then call them. Let them come in here, let them look around, they got nothing on me. You don't know anything, understand. I've gone to see my lawyer. Okay, all clear. Haven't you located Mr. Malone yet? The chief is getting angry. Just don't you say nothing. Stall. I'll do all the talking. You just hang on and before you can count to twenty, I'll give you the all clear. Can you count to twenty? - A one, a two, a three... - Not out loud, you dope! Okay, send them in. Go right in, Chief. I think you'd better wait here, Miss Sullivan. All right. Chief! Chief, that laundry truck just drove out. Step on it! Darling! Are you all right, Mr. Davison? Chief, I never felt better! Dismissed! - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
