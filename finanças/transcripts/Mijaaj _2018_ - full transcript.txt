Hello.. Hello.. Good afternoon Mr. Headley. Did you get the pictures of the property that I sent? Yes, I did. And I must say I love what I am seeing. Good job. I told you sir. Now tell me, what is the price tag that you can put on your love? Love has no price tag, Bhavesh. Love has no price tag. This is India Lodge. When the newspapers would print articles about freedom.. ..this construction belongs to that era. It has seen the British rule.. ..as well as Bapu's seat of 'Ahimsa' (non-violence). Am late! Damn you! You are supposed to deliver the news paper at 5! And now it is 6. You won't get paid today! Times have changed, sir. So violent words are allowed now. Sister, can I get soap for bathing? But nothing has changed in the India Lodge. Everyone lives together without any discrimination of caste and creed. Why so angry?! Everyone pays the rent as per their convenience. Or not.. Check when the tea will be delivered. This is Sarita mother. Oh my dear! Actually she is the owner of India Lodge. But she is more of a mother than an owner. She has allowed the entry of three unique characters over here.. ..who have got to do nothing with non violence. It is a five minute clip. Don't worry. The girl is not even aware. It is in Gujrati dear. So the rate is 5000. Now tell me. This one is also Gujrati. Hundred percent. Yogesh! Stop it, lad! In last three months, I have had to call the carpenter eight times! Improve your nature. Nature and principles can never be changed. Brother Yogesh.. he can't control his anger. And hence he can't keep any job. Wow boss! Solid boss! Seeing her for the first time! What amazing girl! Hey! You didn't tell me that next Ms. India belongs to Ahmedabad! Look at the walk.. what a cat walk! Come on.. show me a dog walk! Come on! This is sister Janvi. Oh my God! If girls can be so hot headed, the Government should.. ..start 'Save from girl child' program rather than 'Save the girl child'! How can you beat them so much? If something happens to them.. Where were you when they were misbehaving?! Get lost! Tell me, who do we have to take? If you are fixing a meeting with Alia, then take me. You've come to the wrong address. Get lost! This is the address from where the call came. Someone has had a fracture. Shall I tell you the patients' name? Prakash and Hari. Hey! I am Prakash. If you are kidding, it won't be good for you! Get lost. Go! Scoot! - Scoot! Hey! Who are you?! Hey friend! You're too much. I asked you to come at 10:30 a.m.. ..but you came at 10:15 a.m. itself. That is not right. Do you know I had to come so long from the wrong side! These people will be done for today. It is their last day here. You do something.. open the ambulance doors. And count till 108. In 108 seconds, all of them will be in 108 (dial an ambulance)! Ok.. Go on. - Open the doors. Go! Brother Ram whom you beat up so many times.. ..I have tea at his place daily! So I have to look after him! Come on! Come on! Who are you? What is your name? Tell me your name. My name.. Jay. Brother Jay! He is stylish.. and he is a bluff master too! And all those who cross his way.. Glory to Mother India! ..go their way too! What say?! Why are you sitting here? The room is locked. - Oh! Bhikhu has said that until we pay the rent we will have no entry. I see. The room doors are locked, right? The room doors are locked, right? Come on.. I'll take you some other way. Come on.. get up! Come on! Come on! Let's go.. Einstein has got an idea! The place.. the place.. Hey! Which way? What? Seriously? It's not Mount Everest. Climb it quickly! He.. Come on.. we have been called.. Is he Spiderman's nephew? The light is on! It's on! Get me some water please.. Go and tell your wifey! - Thank you. Hey genius.. how will she go to her room? The balance of my idea is over. You can set your own place according to your size and sleep. You'll need bigger place, isn't it? Hey pal! He is going to be this way only, Yogi! But we will have to manage some money soon. From where? I was laid off today at work. And your law practice has just started. And this fellow.. He wants to be a hero, but is working as an AD for free. AD means Assistant Director. It's a big post. Hey! Go to sleep! - Good night! How will we manage! Oh God! I pray that at least one of the three of us get a break soon. Please! Oh damn you! What is this! So now, because of you, I have lock the doors here and there?! Why?! Bhikhu.. Your locks and these pigeon nests.. do they allow us to sleep peacefully? Nests?! And look Bhikhu.. we haven't has tea also today. If you're here to ask for rent then, please go back. Or else you'll get one tight slap from me. What nonsense! I came to ask for rent and have to bear the beatings too! Hey Bhikhu.. - What? Didn't I give you those extra bucks, didn't I? Yes.. yes.. - Then count it. What extra bucks? You gave me no extra bucks. The extra bucks that you gave me were those pending from last month. And counting this month, now its four months.. yes four months! So don't treat me like this. Go and meet Sarita mother.. come on get up everyone. Do you have rice flakes for breakfast today? No. Then 'Idli'( steamed snack)? Not at all. Come on.. sister Janvi, you come. they will take long! I got so late today. Mother.. mother.. The three of them again jumped the wall and came. Yes mother. This is the limit now. You have to say something to them now. It's been six months, mother. There is a limit of free lodging! They will pay, Bhikhu. Ours is the India Lodge. What is our P and L? 'Prem' (love) and 'Laagni' (caring). Yes, I know. This India Lodge is standing on the cement of relationships. That is why they are not paying the rent. They are being pampered. Aniket.. - Aniket.. Yes Aniket.. - Hi mom. I was going to call you, son. You've been so busy. Yes mom. That is why I couldn't call you since a month. No problem. Work is important. Is it very cold there? I heard in news that it's going to snow there. The media is always creating hype! It's normal for us. But listen.. I have won gold medal in state level sword competition. Oh wow! I am proud of you, son. - Thank you, mom. But I don't like this at all. Our heritage is of religion not warfare. Mom please.. what times are you living in?! World has changed. Anyway.. I am coming to India. Really! When? Next week. And we will talk a lot after I come. Ok mom.. I'll hang up now. It's night here. Ok son. Go to sleep. I will be waiting for you. - Ok mom. Good night. Good night son. Goodnight! Brother Aniket is coming? - Yes. Mother.. I would suggest that even you go to America.. ..along with brother Aniket. Really! There is nothing worthwhile here. What do you have here? Our heritage is here, Bhikhu. We can't sell it. We must forward it to the next generation with knowledge. Even I have started speaking like outsiders, isn't it mother? Sorry. Now stop chatting Bhikhu and start cleaning up Aniket's room. Yes. Get the furniture in Aniket's room polished now. Come on! Start the work quickly. My Aniket is coming! What are you saying?! Brother Aniket is coming! Did you hear? All of you? Captain America is arriving. Sister Sarita .. why do you tell Bhikhu? We're here. Tell us.. what needs to be done? Aunt.. one of my friend's is an interior designer. She will get your renovation done within your budget. What do you say? - Perfect! Yes pal! - Of course! The building will stay as it is. Just as India Lodge is your home, it is his too. But aunty.. Aniket is coming to India after such a long time. How will he feel after seeing all this? I thought you came to speak about the rent. Huh! Rent?! Shut up! Actually what happened is.. the three of us collected lots of money. We thought we would surely pay the rent today. And all of a sudden, there was a call from her house. Isn't it? There was a call from your house, right. Her younger brother has been hit. I have a brother too? Younger brother. He has been hit. We gave all the money to the doctor. Doctor said that he would give treatment only if.. ..we paid Rs. One Lakh. Mother, he is lying. And there went our money. If you say.. if you say.. ..will take a loan and pay you. Yogi! We are going to be finished! Cry a bit now! You're overacting now. Next month. Yes! Bhikhu, open the locks of their rooms. Bhikhu is dead! Mother.. Bhikhu bro! I need a shower. Come on, open the door. Let's go.. come on! But I have other work.. - Come on! Sir.. sir, did you get the details of this case? Yes. Sir, it is clearly a hit and run case. The boy was racing for fun. How can we defend him?! Just like a defendant. Sir! Sir, it's not a joke. Seriously.. Janvi.. that's our job. What did you think? All lawyers fight for truth? Then all the murder cases and rape cases would end in one hearing. Janvi.. it is our responsibility to defend our client. Just because the father of the boy is a big shot.. ..and has many contacts?! Then who will think about the person who has died? They will think.. it is the media's job. The story will be printed for three days. And then settlement there too. After that, out of court settlement. Such cases happen in this country every day. So please.. don't get emotional about such things. Sir please.. this is really not done. Leave this case. Brother Tejas, you only handle this case now. Okay, sir. And you please focus on civil matters. Sir, if we too support the wrongdoers.. ..what is the difference between us and the criminals? We don't give judgments. It is the job of the court. Let them do it. The hearing that we have next week,, you start preparing for that, ok. Very good. Go now. Ok Tejas.. what were you saying? Sir.. this particular case.. Mark the workers' in time and out time in this register. And when the day ends, get everyone checked by the security. Ok. It may be your first day. But start work right away. Ok. All the best. - Thank you, sir. Hey.. Come here. Tell me. - Name? Kanhaiyya. What are you doing here? - Work. Don't you go to school? If I go for studying, where will the money come from? Hey Kanhaiyya.. get two half cups tea. Be quick. Yes.. coming. How many times should I tell you! I am going to cut your salary for shirking of work. I don't want to hear anything. Forgive me sir. - Get tea fast.. come on. Hello.. yes brother.. Yes. I am Jay Damekar. What I was saying is that the audition that your daughter gave.. ..what actually has happened is that she forgot her dialogues, ok. So now.. to make her remember the dialogues.. ..it will cost Rs. 7514 only. I said Rs. 14 not seven and half! No, I can't say that! I am not that kind of person! Hello.. hello.. I said Rs. 700! Hello.. hello, what is it? Brother, this is Jay.. Jay, the designer. The audition that your son gave.. ..his eyes are getting shut in it. And when the eyes get shut, it costs to open them up. Rs. One lakh totally. I said 10000.. I never said 1 lakh. Shall we round it off at Rs. 100? Tell me fast. Last price.. 10. At least I can recover tea cost. No one appreciates my talent, friend. Everything is a mess. What shall we do now.. Oh yes.. just a minute.. Hello.. I am graced with God's mercy. Have lots of money.. lots of it! Now, I can make your son a star.. tell me, should I? Only and only.. - Hey bro! it will cost Rs. 5 lakhs. How much? 5 lakhs! Do you have? Then why are you messing with my brains so early in the morning! Hang up! What nonsense is this.. - What are you doing Jackie pal! With great difficulty, I had found a scapegoat! You're just crazy! - You moron! Stop fooling around with people now. Stop ruining other people's dreams. You don't know how it feels to have your dreams crushed. Look here. What happened, dear? What was your dream? Tell me what was it? I wanted to learn Kung-fu. You can't do it at this age, dear.. Chinese Kung-fu and all! Just look at you.. When you were born, you were thirteen years old then! Hey moron! I have come to this stage by cooking Chinese for you all! Stop all this and take up a job! I can't take up a 10-6 job and all! I will mess up with 10 people over there! No way! I am my own boss. What boss?! You owe the tea fellow for last three months tea! You haven't paid him a buck! And.. - Ramu uncle, is it? Ramu uncle.. He is my kin! He won't ask for money from me for one and a half years. You can go and ask! Go on. What nonsense! Just because I am your friend.. ..and I have paid for all the dues, you are sitting here. Got it! Do you ask for money? Do you? You don't. Ramu uncle.. he is not asking for money, ok. That is why you have become so irresponsible. Talking nonsense early in the morning! Lots of money.. I need to do something! Brother.. have some work. Will have to go. See you in evening. No work you have, just bluffing.. Mend your ways now! - Scoot! "This is your house and mine.." I'll kill that pigeon! Drive it off, Yogesh! It keeps coming and building a nest! Hey! Talk softly. If sister Sarita hears, she will deliver a lecture. Dear.. this is India Lodge. Just as this is your house, it's their house too. Remember what Bapu said. Remember.. remember what Bapu said! If the pigeon shits on one shoulder.. ..you must offer another shoulder too. Yes.. but that too involves her principles. Hey! What I said just now.. these are her principles?! Sister's watch batteries have expired in 1942! In the age of smart phones, the woman uses Gramophone! Why doesn't man change his name and surname with time? Why are you bothered!? I mean.. you see.. First answer my question Jay. Yes. I mean we can't change our name and surname. Actually, it's our identity. Yes!! Similarly, values and heritage are our identity. They cannot be changed. And as far as making fun of Bapu is concerned.. ..it might be a fashion amongst you youngsters. But doesn't matter. As you grow older, you'll become more understanding and perhaps.. ..then you might understand Bapu's values too. Good bye. Damn! Couldn't you tell me! Glory to Bapu Rani! This looks even better in real. It's just perfect. See Mr. Henry, I told you. This is the right property for business. So.. lets close the deal today. I don't want to waste my time. - Sure. Please don't talk to me about rent and all. This used to be the meeting place for freedom fighters. Even Gandhiji visited here many times. Sister Sarita wrote here in English. Hey! - Sorry. Look here brother.. Nice meeting you.. nice meeting you! Good, good.. have a nice day! Have a nice day! See what we got?! 2 dollars. We don't even have money to convert it. Hey! Hey Bhikhu bro! What is it? - What is it?! Rent. These are fake notes. Not fake.. they are dollars. Dollars?! They are extra. Consider it paid for all three of us. But.. - Hey! You now have the rent till the next year. So don't ask again. But how will I get it converted? Then shall I take it back? - No, no! No, no! I'll get it converted. - Get going! Sister Sarita, he is Mr. Henry. He has come here from America to do business. Sir, this is Sarita madam, owner of India Lodge. Mrs. Sarita, it's a pleasure to meet you. Nice to meet you too, Mr. Henry. Look miss.. I don't believe in small talk. So let's talk business. My company has loved your property. And we're ready to pay fair price for it. Brother Bhavesh.. why do you keep spoiling their time? Mr. Henry, I am sorry. India Lodge is not for sale and it will never be. Sister Sarita, don't take such hasty decisions. At least hear his offer. No offer can change my decision. If you feel the valuation is less, then tell me. We can do that too. I repeat myself, brother Bhavesh. Values don't have valuation. So.. don't worry Ms. Sarita. I'll give you time to consider. And I promise you, I'll match any offer. Greetings. - Greetings. Let's go. - Yeah. Who is that? He is my son, Aniket. Wow! You've got a lovely family. - Thank you. Greetings. - Greetings. Mr. Henry, I can show you other properties. If you want.. - No Bhavesh. India Lodge! India Lodge is what I want and I will get it. Come on. Hakka Noodles.. Hey Kamlesh.. these days you're acting too smart. Who are you? Why are you doing? "Can't spend these days and nights.." "I need to tell you what's in my heart." "Let me tell you today.." Why did you cut my cable wires? V P.. VP.. - VP.. VP.. a rise in BP. Why did you cut the cable wires? You know that the cable is VP's reputation, don't you? A cable was cut. It is as good as chopping VP's nose. What?! Mummy, mummy.. who is that? Hey! He is so cute! Look son.. I'll tell you a story. A lion lived in a jungle. All the animals feared him. He was very hot tempered. One day, a sly fox decided to eat the lion's kill. He thought no one will know. But the lion is the king of the jungle. So he came to know. Now you tell me.. ..doesn't the sly fox deserve punishment for his deeds? Hey Munna.. - Tell me bro. Open Facebook and post it. Ok. Vishwa Pratap (VP) feeling nose cut with dear friend Kamlesh. VP.. pal VP.. try to understand. First mistake is always forgiven. I'll shut my cable business and go away. Is that fine? Let's forget what happened. If I forget that, people will forget what the consequences.. ..of going against VP are. Hey bro Jackie Chan.. - Yes. Send the bill for all the Chinese food to me. Hmm.. Take this. Come on Kamlesh.. Hey Jackie-da.. Jackie-da.. Bro.. - What's up dear?! All fine. You tell me. I'll say something. Doesn't matter if anyone else's food stall works.. ..but my Jackie-da's Chinese food will surely be a hit! That is true! Rice flakes! Rice flakes! Damn it! What harassment! What is this?! Rice flakes everyday! Don't want to eat.. Take them back! I hate rice flakes and I hate this place! Were you thrown out too? If it's for free, eat swearing too, forget rice flakes. Then shall I? Come on.. don't be serious. You're too much. Bhikhu, take these 'Parothas' (stuffed Indian bread).. ..to Janvi who is sitting there. She doesn't like rice flakes. They are not even paying the rent and you do so much for them! Bhikhu.. These people have come here to make their careers. They work very hard.. ..and not just waste time. Go, go.. give it to her. Ok. I am not concerned anymore! How is the work going on? - Fine. Be careful and don't forget to wear the gloves. Okay! Kanhaiyya.. stay away from this machine. But I need to do the job I have been given. You will only do the work that I give you and no one else. But if I refuse, they beat me. Who beats you? I am here, ok. You know.. when I was a kid, even I used to work in a factory like you. But I also studied along with that. That is why I am able to do this job today. Do you know how to read and write? - No. Do you want to be educated? - Hmm. Take these 50 bucks. Get a notebook and a pencil. And what about the money left? You can have a chocolate with it. Go! I'll be back soon. Stop.. stop! Go on.. go on.. Where is he? Call Jackie. Sir has gone out for some work. This is his work.. what other work has he gone out for? Damn him! Madam.. the service is poor and so is the food.. You need to shut this place down. Sir.. we make this type of fried rice and noodles here. No one has complained so far. So I am lying. Is it?! If you are not being able to make Chinese, shut this place down. Why are you looking around? I am telling you. Sorry sir.. I will change it for you in just five minutes. I won't pay for this. And tell your cook to go to China, eat there.. ..and learn to cook Chinese over there. Yes sir. I'll exchange it for you. Perfect. Can't even tell the name of the dish, isn't it? Hakka noodles, sir. No ma'am. It is 'Kaccha' (raw) noodles. Forget all that. Couldn't find out your name. Reema. Reema! What a beautiful name! R E E M A. What a unique name! Reema.. you know.. I go to China every week. Some day you can come with me to China! I have a farm house in Tokyo. Hey! Tokyo is in Japan, not China. Lower your hand. I did. Don't try to act smart! Else I'll send you to Allahabad. Sir.. listen to me.. Reema.. Reema.. Reema.. Reema.. Give the food today for free. Because Gandhiji said, 'Customer is the king'. Right? Yes. Right. Sir.. I'll exchange the noodles for you. Hmm. Now without any messing around with my head.. ..get lost from here quietly. My story is going to be cooked here. Go now. Wash your face. Hey Chotu.. Give cold water at one number table. Hey.. take the order from number three table. Hey! You? Here?! Yes. I work here. Because college is now over. Oh.. Good, good! That's great! That's great! All this happens in foreign countries.. ..you know. - Yeah. I have travelled a lot you know.. a lot.. What work do you do? I am a General Manager in a multi-national company. Oh! Which company? Which company!? You asking me which company? - Yes. Royal Dragon. Royal Dragon.. It is a Chinese company. It's a Chinese Company.. very big. It's too big! Too big! It may be too big. But I have never heard the name. Give me your phone. Let's Google it. Google? My net is off. She wants to Google! He is my kin.. the owner of this place is my kin! If you have any kind of work, just tell me. Just tell me.. without any tension, ok. The owner of this place is your kin? Close friend. Special friend! So the owner of this place is your close friend. Hey Reema, you are back? Great. Hey Jay! Did you meet him? He is my friend. My close friend. Close friend. - Yes. And did you meet her? Hey! Reema.. she is my sister. Reema! Friend's sister?! - Yes. Thank God! - Why? What happened? Nothing. - Sure? Yes. - Ok. I want to keep all this.. I will go. You carry on. Take your time, ok! Actually.. you know.. I am jobless. Royal Dragon.. too big company. Then what do you do? Actually.. you know.. Gujarati movies are very much in these days.. ..so I want to be an actor. Right now, AD and all.. going on.. struggle. I have seen the struggle. I know.. you must be feeling I am such a liar. No. I feel that.. - What do you feel? How long will we be so formal with each other? I mean.. You.. "The cloud of your sky goes along with you.." "The cloud of your sky goes along with you.." "In the rains of your love, I want to soak!" "In the rains of your love, I want to soak!" "Soak!" "Soak!" "Soak!" "Look how my doll looks!" "Look how my doll looks!" Yogi.. our presence or absence here makes no difference to some people. Very true! Our name is not Reema. But what is it?! It's your mistake.. you have to pay for it. I don't want to get involved in this. It's a matter of few days only. I can sleep anywhere. But please help me. Just a minute.. what is wrong with him? Like you, he wants to stay in India Lodge. But he doesn't have a single penny in his pocket. Then he is right. You can't live here, uncle. No one has the right to live for free in India Lodge except for us. What say?! - You're right. But where will I go. My house has been locked by them. Them? Who are them? VP and his aides. Why? - Why? VP's men.. must be he hasn't repaid his money. No one dares to keep his money unpaid. Hey! Who is this VP? How can he throw a person out of his own home? Just a minute. Look uncle.. have some water. Have some water and calmly tell me what exactly happened. He is asking for the interest and principle, both at once. How can I pay him right now? Whatever it is.. I don't want to get involved with VP. Hey! It's just a matter of few days. My wife and son are at her maternal house. But I can't go and stay there. - So what can we do?! Yes.. that is right. You can't stay there.. not at all. What I say Bhikhu.. go down.. go down for a second. Stand up.. I have some work. Come fast.. have some work. What I was saying is.. Come uncle. These are the room keys. Upstairs, second floor.. left hand side first room. Go. And,, be good. Ok.. be good. Wow! Awesome! Come. - Come.. please come. Oh.. he is gone. My God! My God! Where is Kishor uncle? He went away. Brother Bhikhu.. ..once you say no, can anyone dare to step into India Lodge?! Where did he go? Poor fellow took an auto. You know.. Sister Sarita is just namesake. Actually Bhikhu is the one who manages everything. Right Bhikhu!? Hell with uncle Kishor. Today, lady's fingers have been cooked. Is it ok? No way. - Make some bread too. Come without pushing.. fooling around?! Shall I inform Sarita mother? Shall I? Just rice flakes. Why have you got this Titanic? Hollywood? Brother VP.. he is Mr. Henry. He has come from the U.S. Oh.. Henry! Have you got an iphone? What a joke! I don't have time for jokes, Mr. VP. This guy has told me that you could be of some help. And I would really appreciate if you could get this job done. Please add the sub titles, bro. Look VP.. - Hey! I mean brother VP.. Look.. brother Henry here wants to buy the India Lodge place. But sister Sarita won't agree. So that place.. I have to get that place vacated, isn't it? Hey Munna, Chika.. Just a minute brother. Calm down. You just have to talk to Sister Sarita. You need to make her understand.. ..that she is getting a good price, so she should make the deal. 10% of the deal will go to me. Agree? He is asking for 10%. Alright. Deal. It would be good if Sister Sarita agrees peacefully. Otherwise, I already have a bad reputation. Kidding.. kidding.. I knew that something was fishy! I trust myself and my work very much. What were you saying.. about the Rickshaw.. Now this uncle Kishor over here will go in a Rickshaw only. And also the three of you. Come on. Sister Sarita is waiting for you downstairs. Meet her. Come on uncle Kishor.. come on.. come! Trying to fool me?! Come and talk to her so that you will understand and this topic ends! I didn't know that the three of you issue the Visa for India Lodge. Aunty, please forget it. We all apologize. Apologize for what? For what? Don't you always say.. India Lodge is our heritage. Don't you say that all day? There is no bigger good deed than feeding the hungry and.. ..giving water to the thirsty. We have just shared our roof with uncle Kishor. What is wrong with that? And aunty.. we may perhaps not understand big philosophy. But we surely understand that if a person is in need of help.. ..we can't ignore him. Right. And this India Lodge is like a mini India only, isn't it? People of different castes and creed live together. We thought that even uncle Kishor would gel in well with us. And didn't you always say that the whole world is one big family? And perhaps that is the reason why you let us live here without paying. We know we made a mistake. But we thought that it was just a matter of few days.. ..so why not let uncle Kishor stay with us. No, no.. mother they are lying.. - Bhikhu.. Feed brother Kishor properly. And the three of you.. next time you are up to something.. ..first ask me. I won't refuse. Come in.. come inside.. you are in luck. Yes, but room? Come inside now.. don't be so dramatic. No drama inside, ok. And the three of you.. why are you standing there? Go. Come on brother. Why have you parked the car in the way? Leave some space to go.. Wherever VP applies the brake, it's his parking over there. Get it! Come on. "The gardens are blossoming?" Yes. "The flowers are blooming?" Yes. "I am in love with you.." "No, no.. no, no.. no, no.." Greetings sister Sarita. How are you? We are meeting after so long, isn't it? I would like it better if we don't meet for some longer time. Do you welcome guests this way?! Good that I being an insider don't mind. But if you don't offer me tea, I'll surely be offended. Take, mother. Bhikhu has grown up. But I must say Sister Sarita.. The way you're running India Lodge single handedly.. ..very good! Very good! Not single handedly. Everyone who lives here supports me. But how long? How long will you hold on to this place? Your India lodge is like a punctured car. You will get tired pushing this car, but it won't budge. Now what is the point in bearing a loss? What say Pinka, Chika? Yes brother. You're right. VP.. VP! The whole area dances to your tunes and you have started.. ..dancing to the tunes of that Henry. You have been insulted before all of them! Sister, your tea is good. And so is my mood, today. Accept Henry's deal.. it will be good for all of us. My tea is strong and so is my nature. Tell that to your Henry. Not to waste my time and mood. India Lodge is not for sale and it will never be. Not for sale.. huh? Come on, Munna.. - Yes brother. Open Facebook and post it. VP feeling rejected with Sarita aunty. Say cheese. - Smile sister. Cheese.. - Sister, please smile. Good tea. Ok, I take your leave now. When shall we meet again.. Come on! Even with shut eyes, I can recognize my son! Damn it, mom! How are you? Seek your blessings. Slowly dear. My son! - Yeah. You've lost so much weight. Oh mom! But you're still the same. You were supposed to come day before yesterday, isn't it? - Yeah. I would have sent Bhikhu to airport if you had informed earlier. Surprise mom! Forget all that. Now tell me when are you going to leave this haunted house? It may be a haunted house for you.. ..but for me it's a temple. Mom, you still haven't changed. Come on.. you've come after so long. I'll make 'Sukhdi' (sweet dish) for you. - Yes. But less Ghee, ok. You know I am not used to it, right. You have changed completely. I have become an American, mom! What American! You add too much Ghee to 'Sukhdi'. Hey! Captain America. - What?! India Lodge's most notorious and my favorite kids! Jay, Janvi and Yogesh. Hi. - Nice to meet you. And he is my son, Aniket. - Hi. Has he come just like that or has Trump thrown him out?! What?! Jay! He loves to fool around. Not a good habit. Aniket.. you know even Jay is fond of sword fighting. Mom.. I am not fond of sword fighting.. I am a champion. Right. Well.. let's have a quick round then. Aniket.. you can do this sword fighting in America. You very well know I don't like all this! Relax mom.. I won't kill him. Aniket! Aniket! You're good. But I am the best. Better luck next time. What's wrong with him? Sorry, sorry, sorry! Brother had some work. Damn your brother! What about my brother!? What? He is my friend.. you know! That's better. Now tell me what work do you have? Can't stand here for long. Tell me quickly. You know.. do something quickly. Give me a good night kiss. Then I will leave. Good night kiss? Over here? What if somebody sees? No one will see. Just one kiss. Then I'll leave. Ok, just one kiss right? Surely you'll leave afterwards right? Umm.. - Ok, bye. No.. no.. Promise.. I'll leave after I get a kiss. Sure? Reema! Quiet! Go inside! Reema, go inside! Brother, you.. What? What?! - At least listen to me.. There is nothing left to listen now! I have seen with my very own eyes. Brother, we were going to tell you.. Tell me what?! My sister and my friend?! Just a minute Jackie. Jackie, I.. I'll never forgive you. Come on! Jackie.. - Don't come here again! Come on.. - Brother.. brother.. Reema.. - Brother, at least listen.. I don't want to hear anything! Come on. What is all this?! Brother, at least listen to me once. You're just dragging me away.. Look.. you're looking so sweet here. My baby! And look here.. your eyes are shining so bright! Right. Look, you're playing with your cap on. Honestly mom.. I am not at all interested in seeing.. ..these albums and photos. I feel that these things don't let us come out of our past. For example.. this.. your India Lodge. You can't let it go. You're also stuck in the same time as it. I thought that I would never have to explain this to you. Ok. I don't even want to listen. Leave all this and come with me to US. We'll live there peacefully. One who sells his heritage.. ..which corner of earth can he get peace, son? Ok. There is no point in arguing with you, mom. Oh yes.. I forgot to tell you. Last time you came to US, we got a joint account started, remember? I want your sign on some of the papers. Be happy with this place of yours, mom. After I go, all this will belong to you only. Right. - You have to take care of everything. Ok. It is our culture and tradition. Have you signed? - Yes. Take. Thank you. Brother Aniket.. - Yes. Coming. Ok mom, the cab is here. I'll leave. You're going a week earlier, ok. - Mom.. There is so much work load. I'll have to go. And now, you have to come, ok. You haven't come after I shifted to the new house. Come on.. be quick brother Aniket. - Coming. Listen son.. have packed some sweets. Have them. Mom, how many times have I told you not to! Ok, I'll eat it. Happy. Take care. - Brother Aniket.. Wait a minute. Come on.. come on fast.. fast.. - Bye mom! I have checked your luggage and kept it inside. Ok. Don't worry. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! I have just lost it! First of all, Reema is not speaking to me.. ..and this Jackie fellow! Making a mountain out of a molehill! He won't even look at me! Just fill it up! What a life! I am fed up now trying to convince him. I am tired of convincing him. Kanhaiyya.. hey! Get up! Kanhaiyya, we still have studies left! Kanhaiyya.. hey.. How will you value the worker when you don't even know his name!? Enough! You're working for me. I am not working for you! Ok! I am your boss. So don't question me ever again. What is it.. Brother.. slow down. This bottle.. life is even cheaper than it! Me and Kanhaiyya.. both were fools. I thought I would educate him. So that he could be something worthwhile. So that he would be valued. And he thought that I would protect him. Both were fools. Look Janvi.. to progress in this field.. ..you will need right support and guidance. By the way, you people know that.. ..all this is not allowed in India Lodge, don't you? Here! Then why are you drinking? I quit my job. Yes.. I finally finished that moron's case. Please don't ask me the details. I am out of my mind right now. Hey! I think all three of us have a network problem with our stars. I swear. These problems keep coming one after the other! I had already lost my job.. ..and now my personal life has gone down the drain too. There is no reason to say cheers! Yogi, fill the glass. Fill it. Hey Jay.. - Tell me. Reema loves you a lot. It is not the girl's fault. She just talks big. I know that you love Reema a lot. We got hitched at a Chinese food stall! Really!? No one but I have a partner! That Jackie.. is not actually Chinese, but Punjabi! He is smart. No one can make out. Just I know it. But I like his sister a lot. We'll kidnap Reema and get her here. Everyone thought that since Jackie is Chinese.. ..his sister would be Chinese too. Stop it now! But Jackie's friendship is real friendship! Come on.. come on, let's go and wake everyone up. You really want to do it.. really? Cheers! Not the right time to wake all! And Reema is not talking to me because.. I really want.. Because everything is fine. Good.. good.. Go and try to.. - "Pigeon go away.." I really.. Really.. my whole world is here. Come on now.. let's go and wake up entire India Lodge. Very good.. very good.. Come on. Don't just talk. Chatty girl.. "Pigeon come.. come.." You escaped.. Sister Sarita, I am coming! Sister Sarita.. Door.. open the door! Uncle.. Touching your feet.. Bless me! Bless me! I have got the blessings. She will come.. she will come.. Hey Bhikhu.. - Very good.. very good. Where is Sarita aunty? - Give me the bottle.. This bottle.. it is like uncle Kishor. I am done. My quota for today is over. Look at my mattress, it has holes! Have a mattress with holes. Where are we sleeping? Did we drink out here? Damn! Get up. Brother.. brother.. get up. Look.. look before you. Look.. Stand straight. One hour.. you all have one hour. Whatever luggage you have, pack it and leave from here. Listen to us.. actually.. - Shut up! Don't say a word! They are children.. they may make mistakes. I tolerated everything you did thinking so. But not anymore. One hour. But Sister Sarita.. - Aunty.. Damn! Hell! - Hell! Have a good laugh bro.. melody is chocolatey! Siri.. See the number. Hello.. Yes.. yes.. Will be done. Yes, ok. Glory to Mother Goddess! Munna, Chika.. - Yes brother. You have to help sister Sarita do packing. Go. Hey Gandhigiri.. - Who is he? Two hours.. I want this India Lodge vacated within two hours. Else I and my men will get it vacated. Don't you people your people understand when told once? India Lodge is not for sale. Shall I give it in writing? We have India Lodge written off.. ..to Henry's company. Your son has made a deal with us. And he has eloped with the money. Now, if you don't vacate this India Lodge within two hours.. ..then even me and my men don't know what we will do! Oh God! Listen.. India Lodge! VP's men.. What are you saying?! - Hurry up! Hurry.. - Come on. - Come! Hit them! Throw that! Get out from there! What is this brother?! Coming to our house without invitation? But now that you're here, have tea and go! So many have been finished by Gandhigiri here! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him Munna! Hey.. Come on fast. Move! Move! Just a minute.. just a minute.. Why are we going there? This is not our house! We have no right to stay in India Lodge! Why should we stay here? We were given only one hour.. weren't we? Come on.. get going. We'll go and stay somewhere in Italy or so. Why stay here! Come on, start wailing. Just a minute. Your room is this way. Go! My kids! Aunty.. aunty please keep your eyes open. We won't let anything happen to you. Hey! Side please.. side please.. Jay! Doctor.. - Doctor sir.. She doesn't have much time left. You can call her family members. Doctor, we are only her family. You are? Then you can go in. - Yes, yes. Come on.. hurry up. - Sister, keep the oxygen ready. Mother.. mother.. mother.. Aunty.. India Lodge.. Aunty.. Yes aunty.. - We won't let anything happen. Nothing will happen to our Lodge. We are here. We won't let anything happen to India Lodge. Aunty.. - Mother.. Sarita aunty! Mother.. Go and pray before Sarita aunty's photo, ok. Take this. What happened was very bad! She was a very good human. She dedicated her entire life. Soft face, shining eyes.. And she just left us alone and went away. I am so proud of her. I mean I was. Have we met before? If we had met, you wouldn't have forgotten. Ask your aides! Is it something with this place that.. ..everyone just has such hot temper or.. ..is something the matter with me. Hey brother VP.. a man like you won't understand.. ..what is there in this place. Sonny, I never understand. I make people understand. Lovingly.. But you better understand VP.. If you send cars and men henceforth.. we will puncture.. ..both. Sister Sarita's three monkeys seem to be flying in air! We will meet soon. Come on. It would be better that we don't meet.. ..VP. Because this India Lodge is now our responsibility. It would be better that we don't meet. I am scared! Hey! Be scared! Be scared! I am so scared, brother! "We are travelers of love.. don't say anything to us." "Whoever meets us with love, we.. belong to them." Come on. Sister Sarita has transferred India Lodge to their name. She had changed her will in the hospital. And now, you have to take care of India Lodge. And these are its original papers. Thank you. Thank you. - Welcome. Pull it quickly. - Give.. Hey Bhikhu.. Reema.. What is it?! He won't reply! He calls out and doesn't reply. Reema.. what happened? Why won't you take my calls? I haven't done anything like that.. Jackie is also here.. what is it? Why are you avoiding me? Nothing like that has happened between us.. ..so why are you not talking to me. Yes, nothing has happened. But now it will happen. What say? It will happen now. And it will happen in such a way, that we both will stop talking. Take this. Read it. What is it? Invitation card. My invitation card. Your invitation card?! - You moron! What did you think.. it is a Bollywood movie going on? So that I would get Reema's wedding card and invite you! Who did you find at this age, pal?! I'll give you one tight one, rascal! Hey.. actually you are my brother-in-law. You know what.. - Yes, tell me. You're right. We should have told you. What is right and wrong.. forget everything. And as it is.. who can be better than my best friend for Reema? Damn you! You're such a nonsensical item! Oh! Great going! Thought that everything will go back to normal in India Lodge now. But I knew something was fishy. VP would not give up so easily. Come on. His men used all kinds of tactics! They cut our light supply, grocery supply and everything else. And then.. gradually.. everyone living in India Lodge.. ..started getting threats. At this age when you should be an umpire.. ..why are you trying to bat in our game! You'll get clean bowled! Look.. even sister went up into pavilion. Didn't she? So try to understand. And make others understand too. Yes. Yes, yes. Bhikhu, did you talk to Aniket? No. His phone is not reachable. And who shot the bullet and how.. still the police are investigating! Uncle.. - Iqbal uncle.. where are you off to? What happened? - Brother, we need peace. We don't want to get into any trouble. But since when have you started feeling anxious over here? Since you messed with VP's men. You know.. VP's men snatched all my money in the middle of the street. And they threatened me that I should leave India Lodge. I see. So that is why you have packed your bags and going. Uncle, you proved more 'Himmatwala' (courageous) than even Jitendra. There is a difference between courage and foolishness. Something that feels like courage at your age.. ..is foolishness at our age. Yes. And as it is, they have the legal papers, right. Brother Aniket has signed them. Some day or the other, India Lodge is sure to go to them. And what about the papers that aunty Sarita signed? Aren't we responsible for this place now? Sister has gone. And she has paid the price. We don't want to pay that price, ok. And I would advise you also.. Don't go deeper into this matter. Uncle, we are already deep into the matter. We just need to finish it off now. If you all support us, fine. Else we will fight ourselves. Just some troubles faced in life and the whole lot packs bags and runs! Good that Gandhiji didn't come across people like you. Otherwise, our country wouldn't have freedom today. When you didn't have any shelter, everyone came here running. When you had self interests, you found support here. Right Kishor uncle? And now, when this place needs your support.. ..you still are thinking of your self-interests. Got hit! Gently! Listen uncle Kishor.. listen uncle Desai.. Enough. Forgive us. Don't worry. We are here. - Come on, brothers. Forgive us. - Come on, uncle Desai. Come on brother Kishor.. it is very risky to stay in India Lodge now. What shall we do now? I think we should go to the court. I think our case is very strong. So our chances of winning are also good. But what about the papers that they have? I know. But.. - They won't let go. Aniket has made a very big deal. And now he has disappeared. Look, I am filing a case immediately. And if we win the case, Henry and VP won't have any other option but back out. Trust me. That's what will happen Sister Janvi. Really.. really.. Brother, Sister Sarita has transferred the property papers.. ..to those three punters. So now, they are feeling very confident. I want those papers. But brother, who out of the three has the papers and where they are.. ..how will we know. Then we will tell them lovingly.. ..to give the papers. And they will return. What say.. Give. Hello.. Hello.. hello.. when I am on a call.. Here.. here.. I have got Reema. Jay! - Hey Reema! Jay! Hey! You're talking to Jay! If anything happens to Reema.. Then what? Will you chop me into tiny pieces and feed them to dogs?! Sonny.. everyone fears VP so much, even the dogs will go on a fast. What do you want, tell me! What do you want.. just tell me! Paper.. I want papers signed by sister Sarita. Bring them to me and take away Reema. And yes.. don't get those two monkeys along with you. Ok. Jay.. what are you doing?! Nothing.. I'll just come.. Hey! Hey! But at least listen to me.. When I say, pull this up. "This is the effect of intoxicated eyes!" "This effect sounds intoxicating!" Let Jay come and then he will show you! "The by lanes and streets have become sweet like honey!" "Sweet like honey!" - Jay!! "The skies and clouds are rosy.." Hey! Where are you going?! "The seven seas are rosy.." "The sun dial is rosy.." Hey! Stop here. "Hey companion.." Thank you.. - Jay.. save me! Wow! Amazing! - Jay, please save me! Very bad! Hey Munna.. - Yes brother.. Open Facebook and post it. - Okay! VP feeling.. romantic. Jay.. I have come alone. Hey! He really came alone! I thought you three came together in the offer. Two free on one! You have done something very good, brother VP.. very nice! You did the right thing by kidnapping her. - Jay! She has made my life hell! - Jay, what are you saying?! All day she goes on and on.. Jay, Chika, Munna etc.. etc.. Sir, you'll get fed up of her. She keeps harassing me too. Sir.. here.. over here! Forget her! Else you'll regret. I'll let her go. I'll let her go. But papers in exchange for Reema. - What are you doing? Didn't we make a deal? Didn't we? Yes. Now the problem is that, I'll have to call those two also here. So that I can close the accounts of all three of you here. I see. Do you have a drawstring in your pants? If there is, fasten it otherwise your pants will drop. Brother.. brother.. Was this slap serious or were you just kidding? Jay! I was just kidding. - Then hit me seriously. So that I get into the fight mood. Hey Chika.. - Yes brother. Come on now.. call him and tell that brother Jay's life is midway. They shouldn't come until their life's life doesn't leave him. Ok. - Call them and tell. And take the papers. Jay! Jay! Reema.. save me! Reema save me! Jay! I am finished! Jay! Finish him off. Jay! Jay! Jay! Jay! Jai.. - Janvi.. Yogesh.. Yogesh.. Janvi.. At least send the location perfectly. You had a narrow escape! Jay, save me. Jay! Up here, Jay! Hit him! She is down safely! You just shut up! Don't talk to me. Let me go! - Don't say that, dear! Never! Don't be angry! - I don't want to talk to you. Come on fast.. - I don't want to talk to you. Janvi.. thanks dear. Look she is sweating so much. - You go! She looks so good. - Go away! A kidnapping now! Are you serious? Which part of.. I want to get this done quietly!! You didn't understand! Why is he so furious, brother? Brother VP, why did this matter escalate to kidnapping? And still the papers are with them only. So all this was just a waste. What to do about it now? Wait.. I'll explain to him. Look brother Henry.. I'll explain. Papers were inside the bag. And when we were taking them and leaving.. Don't worry.. papers I'll give.. - Hey! It's too much now! Too much! You've done enough damage. I'll do it my way now. Let's go Bhavesh. Let's go. Didn't I tell you to take the papers and leave? This is the first time anyone has raised his voice before VP. Now I'll have to find a solution for this. Come on. You were acting too smart, isn't it? You were laughing so much, right! She was looking awesome! What did you say?! You did a good job kidnapping her, right?! I have made your life hell. You're fed up of me! Then go away.. why have you come back? Go away! Guys, guys.. just a minute. - Yes? We have got the court dates. Wow.. very good. So we will fight in the court and if necessary out of court too. Yes! I don't care what you do, Bhavesh. But I can't lose this case. Too much is on stake. Don't worry, Mr. Henry. I still feel we're on a stronger side. You'll get your India Lodge very soon. Let's just hope for the best. Yeah.. thank God! But what time are you landing? Ho ho! Ms. Janvi is on the rush! Excuse me. This case is a waste of time. Let's be wise. Let's compromise. Do I smell the fear of defeat? Fear! India is a country of losers. You don't know how to rule. You only know how to serve. And that's what I am going to do. Make your Indians work here. Like slaves.. while I make billions of dollars! To hell with you! I'll see you in court! - Yes. Yes. But this is an open and shut case. Did you hear that? Sir I want to call my last witness. Have you sold India Lodge to Henry? Your honor.. this is not my sign. India Lodge is not and will never be for sale. He himself admitted that it is not his sign. And when it is not his sign, there is no point in this case. Wow! Well done! So.. what next? I don't know. But now, even mom is no more. So there is no point in staying here. No, Aniket. I know Sarita aunty is no more. But now, you're the inheritor of India Lodge. And when you have inherited it, you're responsible for it too. These are India Lodge's papers. All three of us have signed. Now, it has been transferred to your name. Take sir.. a cold water bottle. Brother Aniket.. you came at the right moment. Otherwise, all our hard work for India Lodge would be waste.. ..we would have been left with nothing. I still don't know who shot mom. And why. Brother.. we have thousand such questions! But the police don't have any answers. The damn fellows just keep us waiting there for hours.. ..and don't tell us anything. And they charge money too. Hello. If you want to know who shot sister Sarita, come to the wood factory. Any problem? Is there? Where is the wood factory? Wood factory.. take this water and come quickly. I'll show you the wood. Come.. come here. - This is it? Yes come.. this is the factory. The place seems to be familiar. But.. I am not hundred percent sure. "My dear beloved.." "you're welcome to VP's den." Welcome. I knew it. I knew it.. Your deal is with me, VP. Let him go. Aniket, you go. "Aniket go.. go.. go.." "Aniket go.. go.. go.." Go, go.. Go away! Hey! Stop this nonsense! Your animosity is with me, isn't it? Let him go. I will let him go. But somebody first ask him the question. But why did you order coffee for me? Not that one Chikki. Ask him the question meant to be asked. Oh. Who shot sister Sarita? Yes. And Aniket.. you surely must want to know who shot your mother. Of course, I want to know. But you already know! Even my face used to become this way during Sanskrit paper. Yes! Tell me Jay.. what? You?! - Yes, me.. And why not. I had a debt of crores of rupees. And if I hadn't paid, my green card would have been cancelled.. ..or my life. I told mom so many times that we should sell India Lodge. And go to US. And live there peacefully. I needed the money. But no. She wouldn't let me sell India Lodge. This India Lodge was more important for her than her son's life. For the sake of money, you killed your own mother?! I didn't have any other option. And fortunately Henry called me for help and I was here at that time. 'You have to come to India. I want to talk to you about India Lodge.' 'Anyway mom, I am coming to India.' 'After I go, all this will belong to you only.' 'This is our culture.' 'You're right mom.' 'It's our legacy.' 'Right.' 'This is our heritage.' 'Have you signed?' 'Yes. Take. - Thank you.' 'That was a great deal. Oh my God. Now it's time to celebrate, alright.' 'Yeah. - We've done hard work.' 'Deal!' 'Mr. Aniket.. as promised, here is your share.' 'Hello Janvi, Aniket here.' 'What time are you running but..' Legacy, heritage.. the world doesn't run with these big talks It runs with money. Well.. I did whatever I needed to do. And I don't regret for that. And you all are also so decent. You transferred India Lodge to Aniket yourself. Now.. in a short time, a bull dozer will run over India Lodge. And you all won't be able to see it. But you don't worry. Because by that time, you.. Jay.. Jay.. Hey.. Chika.. - Yes brother. End this movie. - Ok. And now no movie is left, ok my friend. Yes. Take a selfie now. VP feeling happy. Cheese. Show your teeth. Say cheese! Sorry Jay. Thank you. I have got my money. Tonight, I am flying back and then life is set. India Lodge is going to be bull dozed and I don't want to miss the treat. VP, great job. I will make the first blow on India Lodge. Good luck. I'll have to immediately go and inform Yogesh, Janvi,.. .. Kishor uncle, Desai uncle and others. Jay has been trapped with VP. And Aniket is coming to breakdown India Lodge. I am very worried about Jay. Reema, its VP who will have to worry. Don't worry, we'll take care of this. Come on. - Come on. Welcome him. Finish him off today, brother. He is behaving too smart. Take him there.. Switch on the machine. Come on! Tie him up.. make him lie down on this. Tighter.. hold his legs. I have come to break India Lodge. Forget India Lodge, Aniket.. ..you won't be able to break even a single brick here. I'll make the first blow. The account is still pending. Let's have a final round. If you have the strength.. post it on your FB account.. VP feeling dreadful! Wait! Eye for an eye.. no! Let go. Are you ok? - Fine. Son.. we couldn't help you in times of real need. Yes. Please forgive us. Forgive us. Desai uncle.. all of us are the foundation of India Lodge. And uncle, because we are together, we are strong. And this is our home. True. And those who come lovingly, the doors will always be.. Open!!! And if anyone tries to mess with us.. ..we will open the doors of the floor above for them. Come on! - Glory to India Lodge! Glory to India Lodge! Glory to India Lodge! Glory to India Lodge! India Lodge, once again was filled with the same people.. ..same birds.. and again the same trouble with the newspaper. Take this! Damn you.. the newspaper should be delivered at 5 o'clock! Not at 6! You.. you won't get paid today! Sister, please give soap. Take this. Special for you. - Really. Bath with it, ok. And see this. The same soap saga. Do it fast.. come on.. No, I removed those. I knew something was fishy. When this man became an Englishman after going to America.. ..how could I trust him? Water it nicely. Let me wash my hands. Our Sarita mother still is in India Lodge. Can we get a room? - Of course! Room is available. Come on. But you'll have to water the plants. It's a rule here. If you do as you're told you'll enjoy here. Once again, so many homeless people like us will have a home. This India Lodge. For the first time I feel as if there is no trouble.
