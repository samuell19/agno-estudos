"Six perverts seek killer" Lick me the way you know, Christie... Come on...come on... Lick it for me... My love... Lick it for me... Spread your legs, like that... I feel good. Where are the rest? Paul and Mirella have gone with Nancy. -Ella, is that you, come here please - Yes my dear. - Do i look good like that? - Yes my dear. They have a...professional cooperation. Nice, nice.. I wonder where do they get all this great mood. I despise them. Where are you heading to. Hop on. How come you stopped. Out of pity for you. You'd find someone either way. Are you a bum or a gentleman? That depends on my mood. Do you make love? I don't mind it. You're in a hurry? I'm not chasing the clock. Come close. How do you act in such occasions, like a gentleman or like a bum? I don't make the first move. You donkey! Pig! You're a pig.... you tried to take advantage of a lady! Stop laughing, you're getting on my nerves! You got my keys out! You'll pay for this! You bum...my keys! Please, no! Mirella is jealous of you. Me too. She's afraid you're gonna take her man away. That would make things easy for you. Not anymore. You and your lies again. You're a married man, i know that. But you never forgave her for leaving you and marrying Paul. I was the one who left her. Because i found...you. Yes...but you never really moved away from her. Won't you finish your food? You're late. Paul had a great idea. We made love. In this heat? Weren't you sweating? Someone has invented the air-conditioner! The little one hasn't returned yet. You're worried? Not at all. How was the stock market news? I had some news about the ship... 5 dead, 14 missing. It seems the sharks got them. Let the insurance company worry about them. Could you pour me some water dear. I see you're a bit shaken, dear. Is it the heat, or your wife? Both. The doctors advice against swimming with a full stomach You should go on a diet my dear. I can see some 'handles' from here. You'll be needing a lift soon. Yiorgo, i think you're not looking after your wife at all lately. It seems there's a storm coming. It could be... I see your protegee has got back with some company. I deserve some food even if i'm late. Where did you pick this one up. -On the road. - How is he? He's ok...he seems a bit rough i think. You serve yourself...there are no servants here. This is a special order for Nancy. Nancy, is my wife. This is our own product. That food was meant for dogs. But people found it tasty and so we can make a few bucks out of it. -Millions... - Right, millions. I'll let you in on the details soon my dear. Who do you think i am? Don't let that bother you... Mirella wants to know everything about me. Otherwise i'm in danger of ending up on the streets. I'll be waiting for you when you finish your food. I paid someone and got it for you. It cost me a bit, but you have the information you need. - Why did you open it? - I'm also curious like you. It must be the guy she brought with her. So now we know who he is. I had a hard time finding out. - I had left you a letter in the drawer. - I didn't find it, they told me someone took it. - Who was it? - I don't know, they didn't tell me. You should insist. There wasn't any reason, a girl picked it up from my buddy. She gave the adress of the mansion you're staying at. Revealing your true feelings? Don't make any more jokes like that! - We'll be staying in that cabin - What will be our excuse? There's no need for an explanation, you rented it for 3 months. I met the rest of them too. - The most unlikeable of all is Tolis. - How did you find Mirella? - Why ask about her in particular? - She's the person we're interested in. My head....my head! I'm beginning to understand a lot...a lot! Enough...let's get back. Come here you boys... I can't take it any more... I'm going crazy... You horny boys... Some body on the lady... Just threw my panties away... My ass was ready and waiting for them. Come, my boy. Make my dick hard... Those lips... What an artist... Don't bite... Let me see your ass a bit... You lick me a bit now. Those lips of yours... Come to your baby. Come on, you little cunt. What a hard-on... Take it all inside....come on... Look at those buttocks... My sweetie... Like that...all of it... you drive me nuts.... come on now... Like that...all of it inside... Take the balls inside too, everything... You drive me nuts... Your tits...your ass... Let's come together my love... Rip me apart my boys. I'm coming you slut, i'm coming on your ass! All on your ass, spread it... On your cunt, on your ass, all of it... You like it eh? Let's put it back inside. You like it eh? - I thought you left. - I decided to come back. - What for? - I lost something. - What is it? - Something. - And i must find it. - And if you don't? - Something very bad will happen. - I hope, it'll be interesting that way. - That's no time for jokes. - Who said anything about jokes... we've been a whole month here already. I'm begging for something to happen to get away from boredom. If someone were to die he wouldn't find that interesting at all. Maybe if he knew about it. Only the murderer has an interest. You mean that someone is going to kill somebody? Here, in this house? Yes, right in this house. Then it will much fun! Let's tell the others to cheer them up. Come with me. Gentlemen...our friend has some spectacular news for us. Someone is going to murder somebody in this house. Nonsense. In any case, i have warned you. Where's my wife. In her room, she's a bit sick. Going to take a look at the dog. Someone stole something from me this afternoon. - What number is that card. - Five... ...like the persons in this house. The card of Death is missing. The one who has it...must be the killer. Damn it...something's wrong with the dog tonight. He got mad and bit my hand. If this young dude shows up again, i'll kick him out myself. We can't leave right now. If we don't convince him to sign the papers, he'll soon notice the embezzled amount. How much is missing? - 50.000 Dollars. - What did you do with it. I gambled it at the casino. How are we gonna cover it if he doesn't sign. - You're gonna help me. - Me? He fancies you a lot, he'd want to have you. When i picked you up from the streets... you didn't even have a second piece to wear. Didn't you ever wonder how could you afford living like a lady? Leave me alone. You used to sleep with men for a bit of food. Now you'll do it again in order to secure the rest of your life. No, this is horrible! It's not as bad as you imagine. I'm not talking about him. He won't notice a thing. No, i can't just watch a man die! Death is really sweet. Especially when it's smooth, without pain nor agony. Imagine someone that wants to kill himself. He fills the bathtub with warm water... He takes some barbiturates. and then, he lets the warm water cover his body. How's Nancy. It's nothing serious. A bit dizzy from the sun. Have you ever considered murdering anyone. I've thought of it many times. It would be terrific. What do you think, shall we kill him? Who? That young guy, Michel. What for? Cause he's your wife's lover. How would we explain though, that Alexia would bring him in here? - Coincidence. A very convenient coincidence both for your wife and for him. I will kill him. You see, you want to kill someone yourself. But you've got to be careful. You shouldn't leave any trace. Police guys are too smart. - Will you help me. - Of course. It will be great fun. Michel! There, at the cabin! Calm down, what happened. Michel is dead, someone killed him with a knife. What sort of nonsense is that! Believe me, he's dead! Look at my hands, they're full of blood! They're clean, they don't have anything. No, they're full of blood, can't you see them! - You're feverish, you don't know what you're saying. - No, i saw his corpse, it's on the bed! - I touched it with my own hands. - Come with me. - We'll go check at the cabin. - No, i'm not going back there! Come on now! Move! There's nothing here! See for yourself! Calm down...and tell me. Do you love Michel? - Did you know him before marrying Yiorgo? - Long time before that. - Then why did you marry Yiorgos? - Because...Michel is poor. ...and i wanted a rich life. - Why did you bring him here? - I didn't! Tell me the truth! The truth! Why bring him here? - Speak, speak now! - Don't hit me, i'll tell you. He would kill my husband. I decided to get rid of him. And so while Paul thinks that i'm following his scheme, he'll be a part of a murder plot. That way he'll become my pawn. And what do i gain. My everlasting love... Liar... Look out for Mirella... she could ruin our plans. I've convinced her that Michel is here to murder her. She's becoming more convinced by the minute. Tomorrow, when we'll repeat our black magic seance, i'm thinking of setting up an attempt to kill her. He lost 50.000 Dollars at the Monte Carlo casino. which he paid for with your company's checks. I'm curious to see how he intends to cover up the loss. In any case you should watch out for him, he knows you're his wife's lover. Who told him? I did... i also convinced him to kill you. And may i ask how? He hasn't figured that out yet. I did promise to help him though. Could i know why is that? It's not the right time yet. You'll find out the moment you're dying. Yiorgo you're an idiot, keep your hands off Alexia. Last night your wife had a nightmare. She saw that Michel was stabbed. We lost a night's sleep because of this fool and his hallucinations. No one was in his room. Not even you my precious. It was too hot and i took a walk down the beach. The fact is that we're all still alive. Except for Michel. I say we go down the cabin and check what he's doing. I'm too bored. Anyone who wants can follow me. You must go with them, otherwise they'll be suspicious. My boy... I can't stand this thing anymore. Everything comes to an end some time. And then we'll be together forever. He must be gone, he's not in there. He's not gone, i know where he is. You've stolen 50.000 dollars from me. - The only way to get out of this is to kill him. - No! Stay out of this if you want to keep up with the good life. This story will end the way i have imagined it. It will be our vacation's best finale. I'll also need your help my dear. You're the only one who can keep my wife away from them. I'm so happy tonight. I can see that. You're not asking why? No... You're a bad girl...you want to ruin my mood. You're in a bad mood tonight. Soon you'll feel much better. - I'll do a strip-tease. - Bravo!! If everything goes fine... Soon your husband will be in jail. and the two of us will be having a great time some place else. Tonight something strange will happen to you. - As long as you don't drink. - Why is that? Because your husband will take advantage again, and slip you a pill. and you'll be seeing blood and murders again. Don't lose your nerve, dear, stay calm. Honey... As a host you should take care of our guest. - What are you drinking. - Whiskey. Shall we dance? They're going to kill you. Silly games for kids... You'd better take care of your husband, dear. Tonight i'm in a really terrific mood. Don't be alarmed, it's nothing, just a temporary blackout. - Put on your clothes quick, and go to your room! - Let go off me! Go away fast! Don't you worry, it's nothing. What happened. Anyone got hurt? Mirella!! Mirella... Paul honey, your party was too boring, and i got here to sleep. Someone killed Alexia. Paul, you're drunk, you don't know what you're saying! Someone stabbed her with my fishing knife! Where are the rest? Where are you going? I'm sick of you all, i'm leaving. You're not going anywhere, i made you a lady and i demand you help me yourself! Let go off me! I'm sick of you all... I'm going! Did you hear what i just said! Preparing to leave i see? You left me with a corpse... and now you're preparing to leave. - Michel! It's not your lover who's dead... It's Alexia. - Murderer, murderer!! - Shut it!! I didn't kill her! when the lights went off i got in the kitchen, to see if the fuse was burnt. Then who killed her? Michel... that's why he was here... You didn't find the killer yet, honey? That's no time for jokes. Where's Michel. Michel? Michel! Enough with your jokes! He's the one that killed her! Don't be so sure, dear. It could also be you. Your clothes...they're full of blood. Don't listen to her! She's trying to drop the murder on me! Michel is her lover and she's trying to save him. So that's why you wanted to kill him. You stepped on it yourself. You murdered somebody else instead. Don't listen to her. She's trying to stall us so he can escape. We'll find out the truth when we catch him. Michel it's ok, you can come out. They're gone, looking for you. He's not here. He must be gone. You know where he's hiding? You must tell me if you know. We must find him before the men do. - They're gonna kill him! - I don't know! They're gonna kill him! Then let's pray he's far away. Maybe one day we'll see him again. And then we'll decide... to which of us does he belong . Until then you'll stay close to me. you'll take Alexia's place. She left this life in such an unjust way. Because it was you that i wanted to kill. You that loved Michel. You would take him away from me. But it's never too late...to prevent misfortunes. That's why you should go away from me forever. Michel will only be mine! Michel...my love! You asked for me. And i'm here. I'm sorry... You rushed too much to kill her. I'm not gonna stay with you. THE END
