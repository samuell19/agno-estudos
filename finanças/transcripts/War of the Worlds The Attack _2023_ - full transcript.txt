Before it happened, no one would have believed that our world was being watched. Watched keenly and closely by intelligences far greater than us. Scrutinizing us as we do cells under a microscope, and yet, across the gulf of space, an enemy regarded this earth with their envious eyes. And slowly and surely, drew their plans against us. Whoa. -Sorry. -A little warning. Well? We're on course. This way. When did you see it, Hannah? About two hours ago, just a green light -passing through the sky. -Green? Aren't meteors supposed to be white or yellow? Maybe it's the aliens. I think I believe Dr. Stint, Ogilvy. We're certainly not alone in this universe. Dr. Stint. Why don't you believe her? All right. Look. I respect some of her work, but truthfully speaking, she has a lot of crackpot ideas and-- Dr. Stint is a leading astronomer in England, and we're lucky to have her at UCL. We are lucky to have her at UCL. Oh, shut up. You're such a child. Guys. Let's not waste time. Let's keep going. Oh, finger. -Oh, shut up. -My feelings. Uh-huh. Not far now. Thank Christ for that. My legs are dead. We have made it through the woods, boys. I'll tell you in five minutes if I've made it through the woods or not. Wait. Where's Herb? What? Right behind us. - Herb? - Come on. -Herb! -Herbert. -Herb! -Herby! What? Ogi! Jesus! You scared the life out of me. What on Earth are you doing here? I thought I saw a... Come on, let's go. All right. Sorry, guys. You all right there, buddy? You know what? I think I've got a theory about this. Oh, here we go. Here we go. -No, I have-- -We've got a theory again. Where's the camera? Bring it out. Yes. Have to get this. At this time, I have to say it. For posterity. Okay. Go. Okay. What I'm saying is hypothetically, what if Martians exist? Okay. So whatever I saw tonight definitely wasn't a meteor. Exactly, exactly, exactly, it wasn't a meteor, was it? So what could it have been? It could have been a probe, a rocket. We could be dealing with a Martian invasion. All right. Okay, just calm down, tin foil hat man. Herbert, I love you. But if life on Mars even existed, it's long extinct. Mars is just a big dusty graveyard. We'll see, Ogi. We will see. Well, you tried to teach these kids. Try to raise them right. Unbelievable. Whoa. Would you stop doing that? -What is wrong? -GPS is dead. Might as well call it a night. But we're so close. It's pitch black, navigation is gone, could be anywhere within two-mile radius. Fine. We can stay at my mom's. She doesn't live far from here. We'll start early in the morning. Oh, stay at yours. Relax. I'll be there too. Oh, now you're making it sound worse. Look, we can charge your GPS and start early. Let's just go, yes? Hey. Coming. Good morning, everyone. It is nine o'clock on 17th October. And we were supposed to be the early bird catching our meteor but our super, super enthusiastic astronomer is still asleep. Nice close up. Very nice, very nice. -Now, Herb. -Yes? -Would you please do the honors? -Of course. Asshole! Yeah, I'm letting you get away with this this time. Yeah, all right. God, Hannah, stop being weird. This is for documenting our work, yeah? Not for silly pranks. Herbert, are you coming? Yeah, I'm here. Morning, sweetie. Morning. Did you sleep well? Yeah, fine. Are you guys off out again today? Uh, yeah, hopefully, find something interesting. And what time do you think you'll be home? Uh, I don't know. It depends on what we get up to. Well, I'm going to Leatherhead this afternoon to see your Uncle Tom. -Okay. -You sure to make it, won't you? I'll try. - What do you mean you'll try? - I mean I'll try. Your Uncle Tom's done a lot for us since your dad-- Mom, leave it. Look, it's not far to cycle or you can catch a bus and meet me there. Yeah. Just leave it, okay? -I'll try and make it. -Your dad and Tom had the same passions that you've got now. And Tom might be the closest connection -you've got to your father. -Mom, the only connection I had with dad was that bloody telescope. Just leave it, okay? Herbert. Herbert, listen! Hey, Ellie. Morning, gorgeous. How have you been? Good, thanks. Busy with work. Great. You made pancakes. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, sit down and get them before they get cold. Where's Ogilvy? He's in the bathroom. Okay. I'll get Herbert. Thanks, Hannah. Hey. So, here you are. What's that? It's a walkie-talkie. Is it your dad's? Yeah. He used to love everything sort of radios and signals. We used to just, sort of, listen to random frequencies and he always used to brag that we might come across some Russian spies up to no good or something. Hey, guys. Should we get breakfast? Jesus. This is older than my grandma and your grandma too. I don't know why people still use these. Why not? It's so outdated and bulky, and it's got limited range, and it's not even accurate. Listen, it's all about 5G now. -6G will be next. -If your brain isn't fried - with all that radiation. - Uh-hmm. Really? -Uh-hmm. -All right. Put your phone away. Let's see how long you last. Whatever. All right. I'm gonna go eat some pancakes. You can come if you like. By the way, um, did you guys blow an air horn this morning? What are you giggling about? They're being immature, Mrs. Wells. You winding him up again. It's jealousy, Mrs. Wells. You know what? I just think they just can't handle the fact that I'm the superior astronomer. -You are so modest. -I know. So how's the research coming along then, Ogilvy? Not bad. In fact, very soon, you should see our names in the news for some very important astronomical event. Hmm, that reminds me of something that I heard in the radio this morning. What did you hear on the radio? Something about a meteor landing at Horsell Common. What? When? This morning. What the hell? We're already too late. What's the point? Just ride! The only thing that matters is that we're the first people to investigate the impact. Let's just hope it's not what we think it is. What you think it is. I doubt it's ground zero of an alien invasion, Herbert. We'll see. All right. Come on, hurry up. So, we're a little bit late to be the first ones here. Let's get some fun. So much for being the early bird, guys. Excuse me. Whoa. So... meteorite? It's big, isn't it? It's got to be at least... 50, 60 feet wide. We should get close to that. Yeah. I don't know if you notice, but there's police everywhere. We'll go on the back. Follow me. All right, guys. I need this whole area, get them out. Nobody, and I mean, nobody can come down there. - Is that understood? - Yes, sergeant. Okay. Thank you very much. Get down. Sergeant. Sergeant Okay. Thank you. Looks clear. Whoa. What is this? It's like a heat coming off in it. Shh. It's cooler down here near the impact. Ogi, have you got that torch? - Yeah, yeah. - Okay. Well, it's definitely not a meteorite. -How do you know that? -Look at the shape of it. It's all wrong. I mean, it looks like it's metal. Holy. What is that? Oh, my God. We should go. For once, I agree with you, Hannah. Herb! Herbert! Herb! - Herbert, let's go. - Yeah, sorry. What are you doing down there? Get up here right now! Quick! You guys better have a bloody good reason as to why I shouldn't have you guys arrested right now. What are you doing here? We're from UCL. Dr. Stint sent us to start investigating the meteorite. This is a restricted area. Dr. Stint will be coming herself to investigate. There's no way she'll send a bunch of kids. Follow me, now. Kids? You all right, Herb? Yeah, I'm okay. Just thinking about what it was. I'm just wondering if we should tell him what we saw. Tell me--tell me what? What did you see? Well? It was like an octopus shrouded in black smoke. An octopus? Yeah. Stay there. Don't move. Well, congratulations, Herb. You were right. It feels great, Ogi, really does. So, why do we think that they're here? How would I know? To have tea with his mom or something. Okay. I'm gonna start moving the civilians shortly and Dr. Stint will be arriving. I guess you guys should speak to her. Do you think that this is-- that this is dangerous for everyone? I'm not qualified to say, but she is. - Dr. Stint! - Why am I not surprised to see you three here? -You know these guys? -Indeed I do. -Yeah, they belong to me. -Well, they have illegally entered a police cordon and you're all old enough to be arrested. Okay. Well, what did you see? It was some kind of... creature. Dr. Stint, I got close to it. And it... I'm just not sure if it was friendly, that's what I'm saying. Damn it. Look, there's too many people around. We were the first in the scene. I've got two or three more officers. The MOD, they won't be here for another hour - or so, so... - Yeah, we don't have time to wait. I need to start investigating now. Dr. Stint. Be careful. Don't worry, Herbert. I know what I'm doing. That's strange. What the hell happened over there? I don't know, I can't explain it. But what is going on over there? Dr. Stint! Have you got a moment to talk? I'm sorry, I don't. Not right now, okay? If that goes out live, hundreds, maybe thousands of people will descend onto this crater. We have no idea what the Martians are gonna do. Move them back. Move them back, get them back. Come on, move back! Run! Move, let's go! Move! Hannah, any ideas? Head for the bikes! Come on, Hannah! How many people do you think it killed? I don't know. It's another landing. What should we do? Let's go back to my mom's. Let's go. This way. Mom? Mom? She's already gone to Leatherhead. Sorry, Herb. Do you think we'll get through this? They're on their way to the second landing. Yeah. I think that's right. You know, let, let's hope the military -can sort out the situation. -We'll see about that. Why can't you be positive, man? ...pebbles into space to wake what you can't possibly understand, and now they've thrown rocks back. And all you see is the betterment of your prideful goals, reporting it on the television. My son paid for your sin, I paid for you sin! Sorry about that. Clearly, tensions are running high here. Let me just see if I can speak to-- oh, Dr. Stint. -Just one moment, Doctor. -One minute. Could you explain to our viewers what you think the intentions of the Martians might be? It's too early to say. We don't know what they want, we don't know what they're capable of. We attempted to have a dialogue, but they don't seem in the mood for that, so-- Any thoughts on the second landing? We're investigating that. There's no activity so far. Any safety advice you'd like to give to our audience? Stay at home and don't panic. Leave your radios and TVs on. We will broadcast updates. If you are near any of the landing sites, do not approach them and keep clear. Please, leave this to us and let us do our jobs. That's all I have to say. Thank you. Dr. Stint, please, just one more question. Wait, no, no! No! Damn! -All the channels are dead! -Right. I'll ring my mom to find out what's going on in Leatherhead. Signal's dead. Try mine. Thanks. -No. No signal in yours, Hannah. -Really? Mine is dead, too. Wait a minute. Do you think the satellites have been compromised? Damn. My parents are in Manchester. Do you think this has hit them? No. They'll be moving too slowly. Why'd you say that? Because if we're dealing with Mars, which I think we are, then Earth's gravity is three times stronger than Mars, so, you know, theoretically, they're gonna be down here moving three times slower. Thank God, finally! Something positive! My parents are probably okay. They're in Mallorca, getting drunk, spending my inheritance. So what do we do? Do we stay here or leave? What do you reckon? I think for now, we do what the lieutenant on the television said. Stay put till we know more. Well, without any communications, how are we gonna know that? I don't know. You know--you know what, guys? We'll probably be fine. You know, our military has state-of-the-art technology. State-of-the-art for this planet. I mean, we're dealing with a world that's millions of years older than us. So what do we do? Do we stay at home or do we hit the road? Stay here. We don't know how many are out there. We don't even know where we're going. Okay. We may be in conflict, but we're British, Hannah! Let's lick some cups of tea! Whoa! -Whoa! -Oh! There's something in the garden! Hey, who is it? Say something! Show yourself! Easy! I'm Baxter. Ben Baxter. Uh, an artilleryman. What are you doing out here? I'm just looking for a place to hide. Please? I just need to rest. Come inside. Please. I'll meet you at the back door. -Are you nuts? -It's a human, Oggy. Yeah? Besides, he's a soldier. He might have information. Thank you. Of course. Is everything all right? They wiped us out. They just completely wiped us out. Would you like a water or a tea or something? Oh, come, come on, man. He's a soldier. Give him whiskey or something. Yeah. Of course. All my friends, they just... I don't suppose I could trouble you for another one, could I, chap? Yeah, of course. Yeah. I'm, um, Herb, by the way. This is Oggy and Hannah. Do you wanna freshen up? Thank you. Yeah. The bathroom's-- it's up the stairs. You're welcome to. So how did you get here? I got saved by blind luck. I lost my balance and fell into a ditch the moment that heat ray struck. Wiped out my entire unit. I was the only one to survive. It wiped out the town like it was nothing. And I was just frozen in fear. Do you have any idea what they might want or where they might be headed? I'm not sure exactly. But they're not far from here. Do we stay here and hope the military have got it under control, or do we get as far away from here as we can? I think we should definitely hit the road. There's no way the military's gonna get these under control. We're like ants. Where do you think we should go? As far away from here as possible. I have to go to Leatherhead. My mom's there. -Then we'll come with you. -Yeah, man. No, no. You don't have to. No, listen, anything we do, we do as a team. Thanks. Is it safe for us to go there? I can't say exactly. I lost my comms in that ditch and I've got no way to communicate with command. Would a walkie-talkie do? Yes. Without the satellite, that's the only way we could contact any other military units. All right. The first cylinder had landed here, and the second one was here. Now, you guys said you needed to get to Leatherhead, right? -Yes! -That's there. Let me see if we can find out what the situation is. This is 19473F, is anybody there? Over. This is 19473F, is anybody listening? Over. 19473F, is anybody there? This is 19473F, is anybody there? Over! This is 18385D. What are you looking for? Over. This is Ben Baxter, artilleryman, Unit F, looking for a status update. Please identify yourself. Over. This is Corporal Fred, Unit D command post. Good to hear from you. We thought Unit F had all gone. Any other survivors? Over. It's just me. I'm in a bit of a hot zone here, Fred. -Uh, I'm in a residence, uh... -Maybury Hill. ...uh, Maybury Hill. We're about three clicks out the first landing site. Uh, I'm with three civilians. Over. Okay, Ben. We need you guys to move ASAP, get to a safe zone. Over. These guys need to get to Leatherhead, Fred. Do you know if the route's clear? Over. Leatherhead? Over. Yes, Leatherhead. Over. Negative. The third cylinder landed at Pyford, and Tripods are crawling all over there. Over. All right. Let me get back to you. Over. Okay. One last thing. Do not use petrol vehicles. The Martians can lock onto the exhaust trails. Please use alternative transport. Over. Copy that, Fred. Over and out. Godspeed. Over and out. What do you guys think? We go north to Weybridge, down to Leatherhead. Right. I'll take you guys as far as Weybridge. I can join the other troops there. Right. Let's do this. We need to pack as much food as possible. We've got no idea how long this thing is gonna last for. Well, you heard what Fred said. It sounds like we're walking. We've got bikes. It's probably not the best time to say this, considering, uh, but you look ridiculous on that bike. -I look ridiculous, Oggy? -Yeah. Martians landing and taking over the world, and I look ridiculous? Huh. I think we're going right soon, right? Yeah, it's definitely next right. -Not yet. -Hannah, it's the next right. We'll turn right when I tell you to turn right. Listen, I'm telling you it's the next right! Oggy! Fighters. Let me check in with Fred. Hannah, give me the walkie. This is 19473F. This is Ben Baxter looking for Fred. Are you listening, mate? Over. This is Corporal Fred. Where are you guys? Over. Fred, we're in Woking. There's not much of the town left here and we've just seen fighters heading east. Is everything all right over there? Over. Negative. Stay to the west. Over. Roger that, Fred. Over and out. Let's keep moving. Oh, my God. We're too close here. We got to keep moving. This way. There you go. Welcome to Weybridge. Let me ask these boys what the situation is. That sounds good. Lieutenant. Hi. Can I help? Ben Baxter. I'm all that's left of Unit F. I'm trying to get these guys as far south as possible. Where are you going now? We're going to Leatherhead. We're looking for my mom. I wouldn't suggest that at all. It's very dangerous. A third cylinder just landed very close to Leatherhead, the Air Force is on their way there now. Well, what about the people who've already been evacuated? We're moving everyone towards London. So, I suggest your family is on their way there now. -How is London? -Clear so far. The underground and the old bunkers offer more protection against any attacks in the center. But right now, it's just the town South of London. What about Manchester? No reports coming out yet. What about Mallorca? No reports of anything coming out of Europe yet. If you go across that bridge, you'll find Officer Marvin. He'll take your names and arrange a boat for you. -Thanks, Lieutenant. -Thank you. That's it. That's the base. Let's ditch the bikes here. Ah, I'll miss you, old girl. Seriously? Yeah. If we get through this, I'm coming back for my bike. Come on, let's go. Well... at least we've got the whole army with us. It's not gonna do any good. Why? Is there really nothing we can do? Against their shields, we might as well be using bad language. - There's the queue. - That's the one. Well, at least it's not as long as we thought it might be. Or because everyone else left town already. I'm gonna go check in with the unit and get some information. Catch you guys up. You check in with Officer Marvin. All right. Stop it! Stop it now! I said stop! All right? You two need to talk your shits out, or there's neither of you getting on the boat. Now, get back in line quietly, and let us do our jobs. Corporal Fred, this is a command post, please respond. Over. Yes, Captain. This is Fred. Over. We are mobilizing all units. Threat intel coming in. How many civilians are with you? We currently have approximately 20 civilians here. Over. Are there any more after that? Looks like it's the last of them. We can't say for sure. Over. Make sure you are ready. As I say-- - And you, sir? - Scott Jones. -And you, sir? -Mark David. -And you, lady? -Anne Fulbert. -And you, sir? -Herbert Wells. Herbert Wells. And you two? Uh, Hannah Jones. -Ogilvy Montague. -Montague? Yeah. Captain Marvin, stand down. These three are with me. Just carry on down the line, please. Excellent. Thank you. Listen, I managed to get us our own boat. -Which one? -It's that one right there. It's nice. How'd you manage that? Benefits of knowing somebody in the unit. Thank you, Ben, really, for everything. Listen, it's me that has to thank you. All of you guys. You really helped me out. Now, listen, get yourselves on the boat, I'll get some supplies, and I'll catch you in a bit. -Montague? -My first name is Ogilvy. Really having issue with Montague? Your parents didn't like you much, did they? Oh. This has to be them. Excuse me. Does one of you happen to be Daniel? -Yeah. It's me. You're Herbert? -Yeah. -This is your boat here, okay? -Thank you. -Listen, you got to row it yourself, okay? Okay. All right. Great. Oh, oh, looks like we're rowing. Yes, it does. -Are we all set? -Gotta wait for Ben. -How wrong was I? -About what? Walkie-talkies, maps, compasses, all low-tech technology. You're right. -I will be, yeah. -Okay. Aww, what a nice candid moment. - Shut up, Oggy. - Gotta get it on camera. Uh, give me my camera back, Oggs. What? At least it is waterproof. But it's not Ogilvy-proof. -Your mom's not Ogilvy-proof. -Huh. Ugh. Whoa. Go on! There's more, run! Come on! -Help. -Hannah, come on. Hurry up. Come on, move. We need to get out of here. Yeah. One of us is unconscious at the moment. Yeah, we're gonna have to carry her. Carry her? -She's, she's awake. -She's waking up. -Hey. Are you okay? -Yeah. I'm fine. What happened? You kind of fell over and hit your head, so we brought you through here. Look, they took out the whole military. We have to go, now. - Yeah. Give me a hand. - Yeah? Oh, okay. All right. Wait, wait, wait. You good? -Okay. -Three, two, one. I need my bag. Okay. Let's go, guys. See if we can find the boat. Thanks. Guys, look. We can take this boat and try and make it to London. Sound like a plan? Fine by me. We should give it a push, I guess. God, look at this place. - I hope Ben made it out okay. - Yeah. Look, we need to find shelter. Otherwise, we're gonna to turn ice by the time we reach London. Okay. Let's just find somewhere to hold up. Nope. It's dead. Do you think it'll ever work again? Always has before, maybe. I don't think so. Never the optimist. Guys... who is that? Hello? Are you okay? It's okay. Do you sin, boy? Are you clear of conscience and pure of heart? Padre, this boy is as pure as they come. He hasn't sin a day in his life. He won't even Google the answers to the crossword. Yeah. We're all gonna die. This is the end of humanity, the human race. We have abandoned God, and now he is punishing us. Sorry, who, who are you? Why, why are you sat on that log? I'm one of God's loyal messengers. Are you--are you local-- are you a local priest? Do you-- do you know the area well? Do you know where we are? Look, we've just been by the river. We're just, just looking for somewhere to get... We're all gonna die. You really should keep some hope, father. It's the beginning of the end. How can we escape? They can't be destroyed. We saw them get destroyed this afternoon. That doesn't matter. We humans deserve this. For too long, we've ravaged and raped the planet, and succumbed to impulsive desires. You've brought this all on yourselves with you, your youthful folly. I tried, Lord. Do you know what? Over there is an actual invading Martian army. And over there, our army is amassing as well. So you can stand around here if you like bemoaning the human race and guess what? You'll meet both of them. And you'll probably be turned into ash. Or you can just be decent and just help us. Tell us where to go. Please. Okay. It's--it is possible... in that direction, you may find some houses and maybe some food, too. -Thank you. -Hey, uh, let's make a move. This guy is nuttier than squirrel shit. What gives you that idea? I'm quite sane. Thank you. I'm the only one who understands. Come on, guys. You kids had best repent before it's too late. Whatever you say, Padre. I can save you. I can save all of you. We're here. It looks like the owner didn't have time to take their luggage. Thank you, Lord. Can you not see these are mine? Take yours from the bag. What? What does it matter if I take my food from there or there? I took these, therefore they belong to me. If you want your share, take it from there, not from my share. What happened to share and share alike, Padre? Isn't that in the bible? You paraphrase the bible, you blasphemer. Do not disrespect and dishonor a sacred text. Sacred text? It's a bunch of gibberish. - Oggy. - What? -Slow down. -No. This guy is an asshole! Oggy, just leave it. What kind of priest is this anyway? He's clearly crazy. What do you wish of me, Father? Father, what do you wish? Listen you little prick, you better stay away from my food. God does not want me to help you. You're all sinners. All of you. You, and you, and you. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Please, please don't kill me. Calm down. Calm down. -Please don't kill me. -What do you wish of me, Father? Put it down, Padre. Please. Please put it down. Don't kill me. Please don't kill me. Please. Please. Okay. Okay. Okay. Listen, pal, we can get out of your way, you can have this place to yourself, yeah? No. You stay. He hasn't decided on your destiny yet. I will tell you if and when you may go. Now, sit! You must eat, woman. You are the weaker sex. Keep your strength up. Thank you. You see, gentlemen, a little respect, this woman puts you to shame. Yeah. We're sorry. There may come a time soon when the repopulation of the planet must begin. Only the great may give you their seed. As God's messenger, I shall be one. These troglodytes, they may not infect you with their inferior seed. What happened to you? What made you turn your back on everything you stand for? I haven't turned my back, boy. No. I've never been clearer of my purpose. For too long, I found myself questioning Him. I would question the disasters of the world and hear nothing. Then He took my wife. Cancer. I questioned Him night and day after that. "Why, God, why?" I'd served Him so faithfully, one moment of doubt and He took her from me. Then I hated Him. I questioned His reason again. And He took my daughter. Then these things came from the sky and He, He took my son. But then, I finally heard Him. I heard His voice. Now I understand. I understand my sacrifice. What it took for me to hold court with our great Lord. It took everything. I'm so sorry. Don't be sorry, woman. What I have lost in mortal distraction, I have gained in eternal greatness. And I will be reunited with my loved ones eventually. Now... I mean, to take a nap. And I want no one to disturb me or come close. If you do, I will carve the name of God into your flesh. Get down. It's gone. Sinful fiend. I warned you what would happen. -Just--please, just-- -Oh, Lord, give me guidance. How do I help these sinners? -Father, you need to-- -Do not silence me! -Okay. Okay. -Shh! Father, come away from the window. He has spoken. We should all be grateful. The Lord has been merciful to you. He has granted you two safe passage. Safe passage to the next world. And a quick death in this one. You must live for now, to fulfill his will. You need to... Go! Go! Oh, God. This is Corporal Ben Baxter to Hannah, Ogg, and Herb. Where are you? Please respond. Over. This is Corporal Ben Baxter to Hannah, Ogg, and Herb. Can you hear me? Please respond. Over. This is Corporal Ben Baxter to Hannah, Ogg, and Herb. Can you hear me? Please respond. Over. Ben, it's Hannah. We're here. Are you okay? Over. Hi, Hannah, I'm here. I'm okay. Are you guys all good? Over. Yeah, we're just holed up by-- in a house by Richmond. Where are you? Over. I'm at Putney Hill. Over. Whereabouts? Uh, near the forest. Over. Okay. We'll come find you. Stay put. Excellent. See you guys soon. Over and out. What is this red weed thing everywhere? Maybe they're terraforming the planet. That's plausible. Whatever it is, it's giving me the creeps. Yeah. Me, too. Does anyone know where we are? -We're here. -Okay. And the woods are, like, near there. So that way? There's only one way to find out, right? Yeah. Look. What's that? I don't know. Could be a signal? Only one way to find out. Guys, let's hope this ain't another crazy priest. Oh, it's Ben! Hi, guys. Good to see you. We can't stay here. We gotta keep moving. Take this. Follow me. Welcome to Camp Baxter. - Oh, dang. - What is all this? These are the supplies I was telling you about. Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. So what? How do you use this? Are you gonna teach us? Put that down. You point it at the bad guy and you pull the trigger. -Now, don't touch it again. -Yes, sir. For Christ's sake, don't call me sir. Look, if you want something to play with, this is a solar powered radio. We're actually in a pretty good spot here. You might be able to pick up some of the pirate radio frequencies. Bit old school for you, isn't it, Oggy? Shut up, Herbert. Do you think it's safe here, Ben? With the fire on and everything. Well, so far, there haven't been any reports of any landings near here. So we should be all right. You hungry? Uh... I think we've kind of filled up... Yeah, we had lima beans, sardines. ---from--yes, we had the tins. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Sure. -Uh-hmm. Are we still aiming for London? I don't know. Things have changed a bit since the seventh landing. -Seventh landing? -Yeah. Primrose Hill. All of the Tripods seem to be heading in that direction. What about all the people that have been evacuated to London already? They shipped most people across the channel to Belgium. And our best guess is that everybody else -has now gone into hiding. -Into hiding? All we seem to do is bloody hide. When are we gonna stand up and fight? There's gotta be a better way to deal with this situation. Well, I've been thinking about that. There is one possibility. Which is? We go underground. We live in the sewers. Look, I know that's not great, but maybe if we're out of sight, they'll leave us alone. You want us to live in the sewers? BEN The point is, Oggy, that we live. That's absurd. Furthermore, there's no guarantee that we'll be safe -down there anyway. -No, there's not. But what other option have we got? They could stomp us into extinction like that because we are nothing to them. Oh, you keep saying that. But we saw one get taken out at Weybridge, no? You wanna hear what's going on out there? Because I'll show you. This is 19473F. Is anybody there? Over. Copy, 19473F. What are you looking for? Over. We're trying to get to London. Can you give us a status update of what's going on out there? - Over. - Pretty bad. Tripods are capturing humans and collecting them like cattle at Primrose Hill. So, I strongly advise you stay out the way. - Over. - Copy that. Over. Now, do you really wanna go to London? Sorry, Herb, I think Ben's right. Cool. Stop it. Fool. Give me that. I don't care if you hurt yourself, but I'm not having you blow the rest of us out, you fool. No worries. I know this is awful. But, you know, I kind of feel safe with you, guys. Especially you, Herb. You know, you're braver than you think you are. That's what my dad used to say to me. Usually when I was getting something wrong. Like, it took me until about age nine to learn how to ride a bike. I think every other kid in the neighborhood had it down by about six. I'd be practicing and failing, and he would always just say, "Keep going, Herb." "You're braver than you think you are." I'm gonna keep trying. I'm going to Primrose Hill. -Are you nuts? -Look, they're gonna keep collecting us one by one. We can keep running and keep hiding, or we can actually join the rest of the human race -and we can fight. -We need to find out what they're doing, why they're collecting people. No. No way. I'm not going. Why the hell not? For Queen and bloody country, right? -Are you serious? -Oggy... we're going. We are. So whether you come with us or not, it's up to you. Really? Herb, Hannah! Ben! - Do you guys know the way? - No. There isn't a single person around. Did they manage to take many people up to Belgium? Trying to get as many people east as possible. -Whereabouts? -Tillingham, that's where they've got the ships to Ostend. Do you think there's gonna be enough ships to get everyone out? I've got no idea, mate. Jesus Christ. What chance do we have against them? Can't believe it. We should carry on. Hannah's right. We gotta keep moving. Come on. Just go around here. Go! Go around. Stay. Stay here. Just wait. Any second. All right, now. Now, go! Run! Run! Come on. Come on, Hannah. Come on. Jesus Christ. Look at the size of that thing. Why are the Tripods going around this end? I think we need to get closer, take a better look. Yeah. We go around west, down past the woods. Oh, hold on a second. Just slow down. I'm not getting any closer than we are right now. I don't wanna turn into a pile of ash. Oggy, we're going that way anyway, so you either come with us or you just stay here. You know what, I don't know what's going on here, but I'm sick and tired of you giving me ultimatums. What happened to team spirit? Okay. In team spirit, why don't you and Ben stay here as a team and me and Hannah will go down there as a team? Are you sure about that? Yes. Could you watch us with the gun? -Sure. -Thanks. All right. Great idea. I'm gonna go try and find us a better angle. Don't know why everyone's so heroic all of a sudden. Don't worry, mate. We weren't expecting any heroics out of you anyway. Yeah, all right. Calm down, John Wick. Are they nesting? Get down. Oh, my God. It's feeding. Go. Go on. What do we do? Call Ben. Ben, Oggy, are you there? Hi, Hannah. We're here. Everything's fine. Nothing so far. You guys find anything? I--I--I can't even begin. But we need to leave now. Is Oggy with you? Oggy's with me. He's fine. He's just keeping-- Jesus, Oggy, behind you! Guys, they've got Oggy. I'm in pursuit! Ben? Okay, go. This way! Ben! Ben! I'm coming, Oggy! Hey! Over here, you piece of shit! Ben! Oggy! Oggy! Go, go, go, go. This way, come on. Guys, in here! Guys. Oggs, help me! We need to get out of here, now. No way. I'm not going down there. We can't stay here. What is this? No idea. Okay. Try down here. Okay. Fine. We'll just--we'll just stay here for a while. -We'll just hide out. -Why? So we can live out Ben's stupid idea of living in the sewers and eating rats. Show some respect. That man died saving our lives, Oggs. Hannah, shut up! You're not my mom. Stop telling me what to do. -Oggy, that's enough. Leave it! -You know what, both of you could shut up. It was your idea to come to London, wasn't it? So don't tell me he died saving me. He died because your little boyfriend wants to be a hero. Oggs! This is no one's fault! We all made this decision. And we're gonna have to stay here, okay? Okay. Whatever. Herb? What to do when we... go up tomorrow and the world is... a totally different one? Well, I think the first thing we do obviously is, is repopulate. What, with your inferior seed? That's it. No, I don't know. I don't even know if my mom is still okay or if she's up there or-- I don't know anything. But we'll be together. What? Should we go and have a look outside? Wait. Wait. Listen. Don't hear anything. Yeah. No bombing, no shooting. It's all stopped. Let's go and have a look. It's too quiet. I think the military's been wiped out. What about everyone else in London? Something seems wrong. Should we carry on to Primrose Hill? Yeah, okay. Let's do this. Oh, God. What on earth? It looks like it's dying. Is that-- is that alive? I think it's dead. Well, listen-- wait, wait, wait, wait. We need to know. I don't trust these guys. Right. Let's check it out but stay in the trees. We don't know what's happening here. Look. What's happened to it? It might be playing dead. Oh. Oh, my God. God. I don't think they're pretending. Oh, it's Dr. Stint. Oh. My students, I am very glad to see you made it. So what on earth happened? -Simple science. -What do you mean? We tried everything. They defeated our military at every attempt. What took them down, Mother Nature. Mother Nature? The bacteria that our body is perfectly capable of living in harmony with, the Martians, they couldn't cope with it. So they suffered and they died at the hands of our little microscopic friends. I can't believe all that tiny bacteria beat these giant Martians. Wait. Hold on. So you're saying... that my armpits are more damaging -than all the Martians combined? -Oggy! -Something like that. -Yeah. Your armpits always have been lethal weapons. Don't. You need to come with us now. Let's connect with the other survivors in Ostend. So are we in the clear? Well, London and the surrounding areas are gonna stay in quarantine for some time, I imagine. But so far, there are no alien survivors and crucially the landing has stopped. Dr. Stint, do you copy? Sergeant, hi. Are they there? Yes, I'm with them now. Excellent. Put them on, please. Herbert. I got some news for you. Hello? Herbert. Is that you? Mom. Where are you? Are you okay? Is everyone okay? Yeah. Ogilvy is fine. Hannah's fine. I'm--I'm--I'm fine. They're taking me home. -Will you be there? -Yeah, okay. I'll--I'll--I'll, um, I'll see you at home. Come quick, Herb. Mom... I love you. I love you, too, sweetheart. I've gotta go. I'll see you soon. - No. - Come here. Come on. After you. Thank you. The creatures saw our species that was self-destructive, weak, and ready to be conquered by higher beings. What they didn't count on was that the world we inhabit is also home to the smallest organisms. These microbes became the ultimate protector of humanity against these alien invaders. The air they breathe, the food and the water they consumed were slowly killing them the whole time. As humans, we may have lost the battle on our own but the earth won for now.
