It' s been a year, but this mountain spa is nice. Yes, especially in spring. What a view ! It' s as if we could see. How many people did we pass today? Well. . . seventeen. I feel great when we pass people who can see. Only the blind know the pleasure. I bumped into horses and dogs, though. That' s because you were careless. However, when we bump into people, they' re careless. Today' s people are careless. Don' t rely on them. They may act kind, but will kick us into a ditch. So don' t rely on people or your cane. Make the best of your horse sense. I get it. Hey, Fuku. Use your sense and guess how many kids are coming. Well. . . eight. Eight and a half. A baby' s included. A baby? I couldn' t tell. You' re right. Eight and a half. Wait. I smell it ! Why don' t we walk more slowly? I' m tired. We must get there before dark. Day or night, what' s the difference? It' s always dark for us. I know, but. . . I want to catch up with the students and pass them. You can' t do that. Sure I can. They have two legs. So have we. You still can' t. Why not? Because you can' t. Why? It' s impossible. I' ll do it no matter what. There' s no use trying. Oh, yes, I will. What' s wrong? A nice woman aboard. Nice? A Tok yo woman. Tokyo woman? She smelled of Tok yo. Those masseurs are well known around here. They count the number of people they pass, and boast of it. Like migrant birds, they come north in the spring, and go south in the winter. Where do you work? Me? At Goddess Inn. And you? Whale Inn. "" Whale Inn" Good evening. Toku? It' s been so long. Nice to see you. I look forward to working again this year. Is everyone well? Yes, thank you. How' s business at seaside spas? Not very good. This year is bad. The same everywhere. This is a gift for you. Thank you. You' re very kind. It' s nothing at all. Thank you very much. Toku ! Okiku? Nice to see you again. Room 3 first, then the students in 5. Yes, ma' am. Toku ! Oaki? Long time no see. We thought it time you came. Okiku missed you. Don' t tease me. Bring me some gifts ! Good evening. Thanks for calling me. Come here. Do it lightly. My shoulders. You love to pass people who can see, right? Not much to talk about. How many today? Today? Well. . . about twenty. Except some students on a hike. They passed you? Yes. It was a shame. Too bad. Madam, you' re from Tokyo, aren' t you? '' Madam''? Think I' m married? Oh, I' m sorry, miss. '' Miss''? I' m surprised you' re at a place like this alone. To rest? Not necessarily, but. . . Leaving soon? Well. . . Staying for a while? Going home, or going some place else? Well. . . Your shoulders are stiff. It' s because you think too much. Do you have problems? Can you tell? What kind of problem is it? I can' t tell. Stiff shoulders. . . a young woman like you? Do you think it' s odd? Not especially. Nowadays young ladies often call masseurs. Students, too. Today' s girl students are bold. Some of them really are. I' m bushed. You' re to blame. Yes. Because you tried to pass us, we were forced to walk fast. Really? Yes. We hurried along, but you finally passed us. So my legs are swollen. Indeed. Reduce your fee. You should ! I never knew that. Sorry to keep you. Me first. My legs only. Me next. Me after that. Well, I can wait. You ran after us so hard, huh? You amazed us. Then, you passed us? Is that so? It was a pity. Why? I mean. . . You were such good walkers, you beat us. Not necessarily. It' s just that you ran after us, so we started to run, too. Really? Anyhow, it was a pity. It was so noisy. I was surprised. Girls are quite something these days. Where you from? You mean my birthplace? Well. . . While strolling from spa to spa, I forgot my hometown. Is that so? I came home to visit my parents' grave. The priest and villagers were all new. I felt like a stranger. Wherever I can relax like this is my new home. Excuse me. Hey, do it gently. You' re all tired. I' ll do it thoroughly. The masseur had a grudge against us? He massaged me so hard that I can' t walk. Think we can cross that pass? Let' s turn back. We can' t get back to the inn. We can' t afford to make a show. Let' s stay one more night. Shall we? Let' s go back. Girl students ! They' ll cross the path. What' ll we do? I told you, we can' t afford to show off. My legs hurt too much. Didn' t we meet them yesterday? Sure? What happened? Forget something? We' re going back. . . Pride or no pride. Really? That' s too bad. It may rain. Be careful. Not every day is. . . Fair. Why not stop talking and take a bath? Female masseuses are popular at seaside spas? It' s bad, huh? Not only masseuses. In Tok yo, women are working. Men are losing their jobs. We massuers may lose our jobs, too. It' s a pity. Toku, that woman wants you again. Right now? All right. Hurry ! Wait a moment. Camelia oil for your hair. For me? Don' t tell anyone. Thank you. Hurry ! '' Don' t tell anyone. '' '' Don' t tell anyone. '' Let' s go. A secret ! A big secret ! Let' s take a bath. We' ll take a bath. Bring their kimono. The masseur' ll come soon. Excuse me. '' Don' t tell anyone ! '' A big secret. Anyone have toothpaste? Will this do? Toku ! What are you doing here? Looking for the Tok yo lady. She came here. She left, as if running away. How odd ! She called you, yet ran away? How odd ! Strange woman ! Hi there. You alone? Your dad? I have no dad. Brothers? No brothers. The man in the coach? My uncle. Uncle? You have a nice uncle. No. What' s he doing? Sleeping. Still? What an easygoing man ! He' s like a baby. She' s strange, isn' t she? She told me to come, yet ran away. She' s odd. Want some fish? Thank you. She sure is strange. How embarrassing ! Yes. They' ll suspect us. There' s no sign that anyone sneaked in. That Tok yo woman was the only guest. I wonder where she is. This happened because you were careless ! Watch out. Still waiting? Where' s the guest? I' m sure she' s the one who was there. Shall I massage you? Will you? Please do. Thanks. Not at all. There was a big fuss this morning. It' s really bad. While the students were taking a bath, someone stole their money. The police mustn' t know. If it' s made public, our reputation may suffer. I let the students stay free and paid for their train fare. We suffered a great loss. I' m sorry to hear. Any idea who did it? None whatever. At the time, there was only the woman from Tok yo. She couldn' t have done it. She' s back. Welcome back. Toku, it' s her. Welcome back. A meal for the boy, please. She' s back. I' m sorry about it. We checked all the maids. I' m sorry. Welcome back. Will you roast this? You caught a big one. You talk big ! Excuse me. Get back ! Aren' t you the hikers I met yesterday? Thanks for last night. You did it too hard. Our legs hurt. We had to come back here. That' s unfortunate. Shall I massage you again? Again? No kidding ! We' d have to stay here forever. While we were in the bath, our money was stolen. That' s unfortunate, too. See you later. Excuse me. She wants a massage so early in the morning? Seems to be. I wanted to see you pass someone. But you got me. You' re smart. Were you there? I tried to shake you off. I ran hard. I sweated. Sorry for that. I' ll take a bath. Why not join me? A bath? Yes. Join me. Together? In the same tub? No ! Is that so? She went to the bath. Let' s go. Hey, stop crying ! No tears ! The next coach? The next one leaves at eleven, sir. Eleven? What train does it connect with? Check out today? What happened? It' s the masseur. You pull a prank? No. He scared me. How could he? Get ready to leave. I won' t go. Why not? Aunty will treat me. Who? The woman we met in the coach. We' ll eat my fish. Forget it and get ready. No. I promised her. Never mind. Get ready. You said we' ll stay here. I changed my mind. Hurry up. Darn ! What? Nothing. I won' t go. I don' t want lunch today. Very well. Tell my fortune. No fun ! I' ll go to sleep, too. Sing something for us. All right. Hey, kid ! How' s your sis? She isn' t my sis. Too young for your mom. She' s not Mom. Oh? Who is she? A stranger. She' s pretty. My best to her. No. Why are you crying? Don' t cry. Go to your uncle. Uncle will force me to go home to Tok yo. I won' t go. Home to Tok yo? Then, he' s worried. I' ll walk you to the inn. Relax. I' ll apologize for you. Uncle' s tough. 3-dan judoist ! That strong? Sure. Where have you been? I didn' t know you' re returning to Tokyo. I' m sorry. He mentioned you, but I didn' t know where you were. I' m sorry to make you worried. Never mind. Didn' t he annoy you? Not at all. Leaving today? I planned to. But we' ll leave tomorrow. I don' t like night trains. Sorry I interrupted you. Don' t be. We' ll stay one more night. She gave you some food? We' ll treat her tonight. Shall I catch a fish? Enough, Fuku. You' re only repeating the same part. To improve needs patience. Need one of you at Goddess Inn. Toku, it' s your turn. Goddess Inn? Fuku, will you go? I appreciate your giving me work. But why keep giving away your share? Why? Well. . . Waiting for her to call you? Shut up ! Go ! Quick ! No use waiting for that Tok yo woman. She went to see a guest at Goddess Inn. Really? Why should I lie? I' m going. Hey, I' ll go. Watch out ! Hey ! You bumped into me. So what? I' m blind. Want to fight? A flea ! It' s here ! What' s here? Toku, about last night. . . I did it. They were tough, too. What? That fight. Fight? I' m talking about another theft. There was such a fuss. A Goddess Inn guest was robbed while taking a bath. The police questioned us too. So annoying ! I shouldn' t have gone in your place. At that inn? I didn' t go there after all. That reminds me. . . The Tok yo woman was at the Goddess Inn last night. Can' t you still get her off your mind? I see. It' s very strange. What is? I got it. Poor kid ! He' s small, but already lost both his parents. It turned out I have to take care of him. Sorry, I didn' t know. Poor boy ! It' s hard on you too, isn' t it? Of course. When I can' t even take care of myself. Aren' t you married? If I were, no problem. So you' re still single. It' s not easy to find a spouse. I don' t agree. So that' s how it is? I' ll go. I' m bored. Returning to Tok yo? Yes. And you? I haven' t decided yet. You haven' t? I envy you. You can stay here long. There' s nothing good about it. I' m worried. About what? Never mind. Will you prepare some souvenirs? What kind? Local specialties. You here? You kept talking with Uncle. Sorry. I got bored. Aren' t you going home? Go back or your uncle will worry. Go back and get ready. I' ll give you some souvenirs. So go back. Going home? What' ll we do? Let' s go home. Want to? Yeah. I' m bored. Bored? Why not stay one more night? Rats ! Is that you, kid? It' s me. Where is she? I won' t play with her. Why not? She keeps talking with Uncle. It' s stupid. Is that so? Why not play with me? Let' s walk. Masseurs like to walk? Sure. We walk and hike. Wow. You' ll go home tomorrow? To Tok yo. We have to go home. If we happen to meet again in Tok yo, you' ll ignore me. No, I won' t. But I guess I don' t go back to Tok yo. What' ll you do? I don' t know. I don' t understand you. It' s all right. I don' t mind. Let' s change the subject. Go home? I don' t know. Let' s go home. We' ll stay. You aren' t the only one to walk here ! It' s you, sonny. What' s up? We' ll stay one more night. You will? Shall we swim? Can you swim? I dive, too. Great. Watch me swim, sonny. Here comes Aunty. Really? My kimono ! You alone? Yes. What are you doing? I came to swim with him. Isn' t it risk y? He' s blind. He can dive, too. It' s inside-out. Gosh ! Thanks. I was at the bridge last evening. But you didn' t know. I did. I knew you were there. Then, why go away? I hated to interfere. I could' ve made your man angry. You imagine things. He' s just a stranger. Staying here, I sometimes miss Tok yo people. That' s all. We met here, but will soon say goodbye. Let' s go home. Why? It' s boring. I wanted to swim with that masseur, but Aunty interferred. It' s too risky. Then, who can I play with? Let' s go home. Let' s go home, all right? All right. Call the maid. Hey there ! We' ll check out. Why not say goodbye to her? You go by yourself. Aunty, we' re leaving ! I' ll write to you. You write to me, too ! Bye ! Watch out ! Careful ! Fuku ! Toku ! You bumped into me. How unusual ! Yeah. I was thinking. I was upset, too. Why? You tend to get upset easily. I' m especially upset now. Remember that thief? He did it at Kamiya Inn. The police can' t ignore it. They' re checking all the inn guests. They suspect an inn guest. Really? Sure. They spread a dragnet here. No one can get away. He' s upset again. Just as usual. Is the Tok yo lady in? Why so upset? What happened? Run ! They' re looking everywhere for you. It' s a dragnet. A dragnet? You can' t stay here. Hurry ! The back way out. It' s safe here. Wait for me. I' ll get your things. Masseur. Stay put. I knew from the start. Tokyo lady, you may fool those who can see. But you can' t fool me. Though blind, I' ve been watching you. It' s been hard. Run, quick ! Go somewhere I don' t know. When the thefts occurred at Whale Inn and Goddess Inn, I tried hard to trust you. The more I tried to trust you, the more certain I became of it. So please run to somewhere I don' t know. You' re making a terrible mistake. I don' t think so. Why were you always thinking and worrying like that? The sound of footsteps frightened you, too. Although blind, I' ve been watching. The whole thing is ridiculous. But I appreciate your kindness. So I' ll talk. I ran away from Tok yo to these mountains. But not because of what you said. Then, why did you run? I got disgusted with my patron. No, I should say, I felt sorry for his wife and daughter. I' m sure he' s looking for me. He' ll look everywhere for me. That' s how he is. That' s why footsteps frighten me. Your eyes that could not see, was too keen. You see too well. You tried to help me run away. I appreciate it. I' ll run somewhere. My lecherous patron won' t find me. I' ll keep running. Tell the boy to grow up into a fine man. Yes, ma' am. Good bye. The End
