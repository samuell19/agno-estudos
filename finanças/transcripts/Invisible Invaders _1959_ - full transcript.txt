Since the first revelation of the atom bomb at Hiroshima in 1945... the United States, England and Russia... have been experimenting with more and more increasingly deadly weapons. Every day, there is more concentration on the race for atom supremacy. Sometimes machines and men, such as Carl Noymann... are driven beyond the line of endurance. And when that happens... In Washington, the accident became the subject of an intense discussion... by high-ranking officials. Dr. Penner, science is your business. Protecting this country is mine. You say we should call an immediate end to nuclear experimentation. - But you know that's impossible. - Then limit it to experiments for peace. We've been over all this before. After what happened, I thought you might think differently. That's why I flew here. General, since I can't change your mind... I am resigning from the Commission. - I want nothing more to do with the project. - You're being panicked by one incident. Panicked? The area around Dr. Noymann's laboratory won't be livable for years. Every test made since the explosion yesterday... shows pollution of our atmosphere, the air we breathe. Every precaution is being taken to protect the people in that district. - Decontamination crews are... - Are what? Cleansing the air? Straining it, as you would dirty water? Radioactive particles have been blown into space. Who can tell when those particles will come down to Earth again? You don't even know what lasting effect... they might have on the space around the Earth. Dr. Penner, please reconsider. The Commission can't afford to lose its top man. Sorry, but I think my attitude now... would be more of a hindrance than a help to the Commission. I'm going to fly home in time for Carl Noymann's funeral... and I'm not coming back to Washington. Goodbye, General. Carl Noymann and I were friends since childhood. We grew to manhood sharing the same goal. Science for the benefit of humanity. Somewhere, our ideals were lost... and Carl Noymann died because of it. A deadly weapon he was helping to create killed him. But Carl Noymann hasn't died in vain. His death has served a purpose... to bring me back to my senses. I've found again the ideals Carl and I once had. From now on, my work will be devoted to the aid of humanity... not its destruction. I have made my pledge to you, Carl. May God rest your soul. - How is he? - Asleep. He's exhausted. I'm sorry your father resigned from the Commission. It puts us on opposite sides of the fence. It's become an obsession with him. I hope he gets over it. I'm sure he will. I'd better get some sleep. I have to catch an early plane back to Washington the first thing in the morning. It's good seeing you again, Phyllis. It's been a long time, John. - I'll drive you downtown. - Wonderful. I'm glad you could fly in for the funeral. I know Dad appreciates it. I'll call and see how he is before I leave in the morning. Carl! Adam Penner, you will listen carefully. You can't be Carl. You can't be. No. This is the corpse of an Earthman who was known as Carl Noymann. Earthman? I am from another planet, outside your galaxy. I'm sorry. I just don't understand. Adam Penner, you can save the people of Earth from total destruction. Unless Earth surrenders in 24 hours, we will begin a mass invasion. This is fantastic. You expect me to believe that you can overrun the entire world? Your scientists think that the moon is a dead planet. That it is uninhabited. It is not. You're a madman. We know it is. More than 20,000 years ago, my planet invaded the moon... and destroyed the life that existed there. We have controlled the moon since then... and made it an impregnable base for our spaceships. - We'd have seen signs of life there. - You would see nothing. We are invisible. We are invisible, Adam Penner. Long ago we learned to change the molecular structure of our bodies. You cannot see us. I am using this dead man's body so that I can communicate with you. Why do you want us to surrender? What do you want of Earth? We have studied your languages and your many civilizations... for thousands of years. We have never bothered Earth because of its slow scientific development. But now you are approaching the Space Age. You are testing nuclear and rocket devices for travel into space. As we have put the moon and many other planets under our rule... it is now time for us to put Earth under our rule. Dictatorship of the universe! We cannot be defeated. We have never been defeated. Just as I have done with the dead body of Carl Noymann... my people will come to your planet... and inhabit the bodies of other dead Earthmen. The dead will kill the living. And the people of Earth will cease to exist. That is the message you will bring your people. Why me? Why did you choose me? Your voice has been the loudest for peace. You have demanded that the nations... stop the manufacture of nuclear weapons for war. Adam Penner, if you want peace... you will tell your people to surrender now and avoid war. They'll never surrender. They'll fight. As fast as you can land your spaceships here, they'll destroy them. Hold out your hand. What is it? The material from which our spaceships are constructed. We have made everything on our planet invisible. - That sound... - Look closely. You are holding the material from which we build our ships. Without this device, you cannot see it. Now that you know you cannot find our ships to destroy them... you will bring the message to your people. They won't listen. Nobody will believe me. You have had your warning. - John, please be patient with him. - Of course. I know that this won't interfere with your plans to return to Washington. We'll see. Besides, it gives me a little more time to see you. When I came home and found that he actually believed that fantastic story... - I had to turn to someone. - I'm glad you came back to the hotel for me. I'm sure all he needs is a little rest. Dad. - You brought John back? - Yes, I'm here, Adam. - Phyllis told you about it? - Yes. This has to be just something in your mind. A nightmare. You know that, don't you? The corpse of Carl Noymann was in this room. - It was no nightmare. - Oh, Dad. And I'm not insane, Phyllis. I'm not having a breakdown. Try to understand. There's no time to argue. Don't ask me to get proof. I can't explain what happened tonight. I'm not going to try. All I know is... that we're all just 24 hours away from destruction. Adam, in heaven's name! Phyllis told me that you want me to go to Washington... to alert them about this crazy idea. You must! Do you expect them to believe such a thing? Not from me, not after the things I've said to them about the nuclear tests. - But they might believe you. - You're asking me to make a fool of myself. In 24 hours, John, you might not be alive... to enjoy that precious career of yours. Please, John? Adam, I owe you a great deal. Everything I know, you taught me. I don't want to do this, for both our sakes. But, if that's what you want, I'll go to Washington... and tell them what you said. Then hurry. Every hour counts. Now make them realize that. I'll be in Washington in a few hours. I'll try, that's all I can promise. Goodbye, Phyllis. If Carl had only left me some proof, something to convince them... Dear Lord, I pray that I am insane... that all that happened is only in my mind. I pray that tomorrow the sun will shine again on living things. Not on a world where only the dead walk the Earth. - Well, John? - I see you've read the papers, Adam. Wasn't there anyone who'd listen to you? He tried, Dad. John really did try. All you've succeeded in doing is making laughing stocks out of both of us. I hope you're satisfied. I want to believe that I'm out of my mind, John, but I can't. You've been with me all day, hon. Was I rational? Yes. He was, John, every minute. I'd know. He's not sick. I don't know what to say, Phyllis. At 11:30, the 24 hours will be up. We need time. They must give it to us. They must. You honestly believe you can contact these... invisible things again? I don't know. But we have to try. Where? How, Dad? The one I talked to was using Carl Noymann's body. - Perhaps if we go to the cemetery... - Adam! We've nothing to lose, John. Please. Like I told you, he's not sick. I'll drive. If you are here, if you can see me... or hear me... please, I must talk to you. I beg you, I plead with you, in the name of humanity... please, let me have this one chance to speak. Speak, Adam Penner. I tried to do what you wanted. You failed, Adam Penner. No one would listen. We must have time. Please, give me time to try again. Your voice is not enough. You are alone, Adam Penner. You cannot succeed. But the people of Earth will have one more warning. How? What will you do? One more warning. That is all. Listen. I don't hear anything. That rasping sound, the breathing. It's stopped. They're gone. What do you believe now, John? What can we do? What can we possibly do? Nothing. The warning will come. Then it'll be up to the world. It's out of our hands. The first warning came in the wake of a fatal air crash... outside Syracuse, New York. The pilot had been killed. But, within minutes, his lifeless body was inhabited... by one of the invisible invaders. Girard back to Fontaine. Fontaine shoots. The puck is deflected. It hits the cage and goes off to one side. The invader, using the pilot's body... had come to issue the first public threat to the people of Earth. Icing is called. They'll have to bring the puck all the way back to Rover ice. People of Earth, this is your last warning. Unless the nations of your planet surrender immediately... all human life will be destroyed in a war you cannot win. The invader, finished with the corpse... left it and again became invisible. The second warning came in California. People of Earth... this is your last warning. Unless the nations of your planet... surrender immediately... all human lives will be destroyed. And the entire world has felt the shock of sudden and very strange warnings... delivered by some sort of invisible life from another planet. At this very moment, every capital in the world... has called an emergency meeting to discuss a unified defense of the Earth. Apparently, there is no indication that any of the nations intend to surrender... as demanded by the invaders. People of Earth, our warnings have been ignored. The invasion of Earth has started. Within three days... the dead will destroy all the living and we will rule the earth. For the human race, this is the end of existence. By late that same afternoon, the invaders had instigated... a worldwide reign of terror with sabotage. Buildings and industrial plants were hit by explosions. Large dams in the United States, Holland... Finland and Russia were blown up... flooding the areas around them, inundating towns and cities... killing thousands. Bridges leading to key military installations were destroyed... stopping all traffic to these vital centers. Throughout the entire world, the dead are leaving cemeteries... to attack the living. Walking dead who kill, but cannot be killed. Horror, fear and panic have turned the civilized peoples of the Earth... into howling mobs. It is impossible to estimate the death toll... since many of our news headquarters in other nations have been destroyed. Just a moment. We have a bulletin from Washington. Dr. Adam Penner has again taken charge of the Atom Commission. He and other top scientists are being sent to laboratories in underground bunkers... throughout the United States, where they will try to find... methods of fighting the invasion of the invisible enemy. Well, that must be John now. - I was afraid you weren't going to make it. - We just about did. - Miss Penner, Major Jay. - How do you do? The Pentagon had assigned Major Bruce Jay, of the Air Force... to escort the group to one of the underground bunkers... 27 miles outside of town. The news said there was fighting in the Lawnhurst area. - Bunker 4's been cut off. - We'll try Number 6. - Can't we stop them at all? - They're sabotaging large installations. - It's our job to find some sort of weapon. - What about the others on the Commission? 27 scientists have been moved to other underground bunkers. They'll be working on this project, also. Here, can I help you? All right, hang on. Maj. Jay, who had been briefed thoroughly... in the operation of the complex underground bunkers... was to afford whatever protection he could for the scientists. The walking dead were everywhere now. A vast army of destruction that could not be killed. Just keep your hands up where I can see them. I got no way of getting out of this part of the country, except on foot. - I want that jeep you're driving. - This is an official mission. Get off the road. You think you're better than I am? You think you got a right to live, and I ain't? I seen them walking dead things. I seen them. Joe Anderson and his wife drowned two weeks ago. Now walking through the fields again. Walking and killing. I'll give you three to get out of that car, then I'm shooting. One! All right, get out. Don't do anything to make him nervous. He's out of his head. - What are you gonna do? - Just get out. Two! You killed him. Maybe you've got some answers this country needs. Anyway, we're only a few miles from the bunker. I wasn't going to let him stop us. Everybody get back in the jeep. I said get back in the jeep! The jeep arrived without further incident at the camouflaged entrance... of Bunker Number 6, which had been built to be bombproof... in the event of an all-out atom-bomb war. The control panel's over there, everything's marked. Shut the door. I'll meet you in the lab. Able Fox Niner Six on May Day Channel 1. Calling May Day Homer. This is Able Fox Niner Six. Over. May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six. Just a moment, sir. Gen. Stone? - It's Major Jay, on Number Six. - Then he got through all right? Yes. Maj. Jay, Dr. Lamont, Prof. Penner and his daughter. Good. Major Jay, listen carefully, all of you. A worldwide state of extreme emergency exists. The federal government has been evacuated from Washington. Total military and scientific mobilization has been ordered. Attempts to negotiate with the invaders have proven hopeless. Continuing efforts by the military to destroy the invaders have failed. Hold on, General, be right with you. Remote Geiger counter shows high radioactivity outside. All of you, turn off those white switches, quick. We're all right now. Those switches hermetically seal the bunker. Make it bombproof, safe from almost anything. But why the high radioactivity outside? We'd hear, or at least feel, any nuclear explosion... close enough to give a reading like that. The radioactivity isn't constant. It goes up and down. Cyclic pulsation? Doesn't make any sense at all. As if the wind were blowing radioactivity in, then out, then in? Or a line of something going past one at a time. - We better take a look. - Look? Closed-circuit TV wasn't affected by the jamming. They've found us. No, not yet they haven't. But they're looking. And that's the reason why. The walking dead, inhabited by the invisible enemy... had left their spaceship nearby to search for the scientists. So far, it looks like they don't know the bunker's here. You were right. The invaders occupying those dead bodies are highly radioactive. Able Fox Niner Six to May Day Homer. Over. - What happened? - Invaders outside the bunker looking for us. We picked them up with the Geiger counters. We've already discovered they're highly radioactive. Unfortunately, we can't give you any help. No one's been able to come up with a clue to stop the invaders. We don't know how you're going to do the job... but you must find some weapon to stop the invaders. You'll use May Day S.O.X. for your reports. Good luck to you. Good luck to all of us. Over and out. Roger Wilco. Over and out. Well, you heard him. Any ideas? Every scientist in the world must be working on this. How do they expect us to hold out long enough in this prison? Those things out there are breathing down our necks. We're all scared, Dr. Lamont. You're not alone. Sorry. When I saw that farmer you killed walking past the bunker... I don't see any point of your being insulting about it. I'm in charge of this outfit. We've got a job to do, and we're gonna do it, now. I'm sure that Dr. Lamont and my father realize that. Since this started, I've seen a lot of men crack up mentally... like that farmer out there, but we need you. You can't afford the luxury of cracking up. John, the Major is right. We're all gonna need sleep by tonight. The work can't stop, so we'll have to sleep in four-hour shifts. - Agreed? - Agreed. - You gonna need your daughter? - Not until she has to take some notes for us. All right. You'll find everything you need here. If it isn't here, it doesn't exist. Miss Penner, you'll help me with the supplies. Meanwhile, the sabotage by the invaders... went on in ever-increasing fury. Government buildings, communications units... warehouses, army supply depots... railroad and air terminals were the victims of incendiaries... completely demoralizing the high commands... of the armed services of every nation in the world. May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six. This is Able Fox Niner Six. Major Jay. Over. Major, Gen. Stone. Is Dr. Penner there? Yes, sir. Right next to me. We can't hold out here much longer. Any progress there? Nothing definite, sir. Maybe this will be of some help. We've been able to establish a definite pattern. The invaders either have no weapons of their own, which is unlikely... or the ones they do have won't work in our atmosphere. General, this is Dr. Penner. What about the sabotage, the explosions, the fires? All created by our own weapons against us. Then their only weapon, actually, is the fact that they're invisible. That's right. Dr. Harkov, in Moscow, believes there must be a weakness... in the molecular structure of their basic materials... their metals, in Earth's atmosphere. It might also indicate a weakness in the molecular structure of their bodies. Thanks, General. This might help. We'll report back in two hours, sir. - Right. - Over and out. Shall I wake up Lamont and your daughter? Not yet. They've only had a little over an hour's rest. I want to work on this new aspect alone for a while. Dr. Penner... do you still feel the same way about the testing of nuclear weapons? Yes, Major, I think I do. If the Lord wills it, we'll come out of this alive. Then, perhaps, the nations of the world will realize it's possible to work together... as they're doing now... instead of trying to destroy each other with nuclear bombs. You didn't sleep much. I thought I heard the radio. Gen. Stone had something for us. - Your father thought it might be a lead. - Can I help? He wants to work on it alone. You hate my guts, don't you? You killed a man in cold blood this morning. I keep seeing his face. So do I. I fought all the way through Korea. Probably killed a lot of men. But I never saw their faces. Dropping a bomb from a plane isn't quite so personal. Can I make you some coffee? No, thanks. I've had enough already. It was either your father or the man with the shotgun. I had to make a choice. Perhaps I was wrong about John, too. What about? The way you insulted him. You had to make that choice, too. Well, he was going off the deep end. It worked, didn't it? At least, it was better than slugging him. I majored in Psychology at college... but I'll take a few lessons from you, Major. Yeah, sure. If there's anything left of this world after we get out of here, we'll talk about it. About Lamont, you two majoring in each other? Lamont and I... Phyll. Get John for me, please. Hurry. Find something? I'm not sure it'll work. It's going to take some courage to find out. Major, one of us will have to leave the bunker. What is it, Adam? I told you of the device used by the invader who contacted me. - The thing that made the metal ore visible. - Yes. Since this morning, I've been working on the theory that the device... may have projected a ray of some sort. Now, only two theories seem to make any sense. That the ray changed the light spectrum, or that it temporarily changed... the molecular structure of the ore itself. Dr. Penner. You said one of us would have to leave the bunker. - Why? - I'm getting to that, Major. Before I can test either of the theories... we'll have to capture one of the invaders to test it on. - That's a pretty tall order. - We have no choice. We'll have to bring one of the creatures into the bunker. How can you possibly capture something you can't see? There's a fire-foam spray among our equipment. Can you convert it to handle an acrylic spray? Acrylic spray? A liquid plastic mixed with a catalyst that... covers and solidifies on contact, forms a hard shell. The stuff used to mothball Navy equipment and tanks. If I can convert the gun, then what? I believe... the invisible creatures enter a dead body through the pores of the skin. Sort of an osmosis process. And the acrylic spray will seal the body so the invader can't get out? It's only a theory. I said it might not work. We can't take this chance. One of them might escape in the bunker. None of us would be safe. Maybe there's another way. Maybe there's something else... If there is another way, we haven't got time. Dr. Penner, you get on with the spray. I'll try and convert the gun. Phyllis. They've no right to put you in such danger. Haven't they, John? By 11:30 of the first night... the nations of Earth were close to total defeat. All through the night, Dr. Penner and Dr. Lamont... labored to manufacture the acrylic formula. Meanwhile, Major Jay, with the help of Phyllis Penner... converted the fire-foam gun so that it could use the liquid plastic. By dawn, they had succeeded. Remember, if I don't make it, you'll have to try again. They won't quit now. You asked about John and me. We're just old friends. That's all. I'm glad I asked. All clear. All clear. Okay, open the door. There's enough radiation out there to kill you. Please be careful. This suit's tough. I'll be all right. The Geiger counter. Something's coming. - He got him. - Wait. He didn't finish the spray. No! We can use the truck to get to him. Look. He's leaving. If he gets far enough away, we won't need the truck. Now! Thanks. I'm all right. The spray gun won't work. It's not fast enough. However, I still think the acrylic spray is the answer. When I hit the body with it, the invader took off fast. - He was afraid of it. - But how can we use it? Well, that depends on Lamont's nerves. Major, you've been trying... All right, all right, take it easy. Relax. I need your help. I'm asking for it. My life will be in your hands, and I don't want to go into this thing with... two strikes against me. - What do you want me to do now? - I'll tell you in a minute. Dr. Penner, can you make up a large amount of this spray? - We might. - All right. We're gonna have to move fast now, after what's happened. Have any of you wondered why I wasn't killed by that invader? You said the invader was frightened by the spray. That's right. The spray was more important than I was. He probably went back to his spaceship... to report we were getting close to something that might bother them. Now they'll double their forces to find our bunker and knock it out. It will also mean the entire area around here will be filled with them. That's why only two of us will leave. Phyllis and Dr. Penner will stay here. If we're not back, there'll be someone left to keep working. - There's only one radiation suit. - That's all we need. You'll stay in the cab of the truck. It's protected. As you say. All right, let's get busy on the spray. I'll explain what I have in mind. Knowing the invader's spaceship must be in the area... Major Jay chose a likely spot to set his trap for catching one of the enemy. Okay, this looks like the spot. They're around here, but not too close. Remember, don't get out of the truck. I understand. Major, there's one thing you haven't said. Yeah? You're actually making yourself the bait in a trap to catch one of the creatures. Know a better way to go fishing? No, I don't. All right, stay with that Geiger counter. In case I get company, signal with that horn, and fast. One long, one short. A deep hole had been dug. And now it was being filled with the acrylic liquid. The next step was to set a noose beneath the liquid... for once the acrylic hardened... the encased corpse would have enormous weight. The plan now was to lure one of the walking dead into the area... where the pit had been dug. A direct attack by Major Jay was the quickest... though the most dangerous, method of baiting the invader. - They're coming, get ready. - All right, Dad. - You okay? - I'm okay. Get your father, I want to get this into the chamber. Major Jay! They're all around us. I saw them on the monitors. They probably followed the truck. They're trying to smash down the door. Take it easy. This place is built to stand an atom blast. Come on, help me. Are you sure the pressure will crack that stuff on the body? It can crush anything not built to withstand it. All right, when the acrylic coating on the body splits... we'll be turning an invader loose in the chamber... if we've caught one. Let's find out. The pressure, Dr. Penner. Nothing's happening. Now we've got one of those things in here... and a mob of those dead men right outside. If you hadn't gone out in the truck, they couldn't have followed us. John, shut up. Another point, Dr. Penner. Look! The thing is in there. Yeah. It looks like we caught ourselves an invader. The rest is up to you, Dr. Penner. Wait. It's left the body. Let's hope we can keep it locked up in that chamber. Do not think you will succeed. There is no way on your earth to make us visible. Your people are being destroyed... country by country. My unit has already received reports... that many of your nations are considering surrender. You're lying. You can check with your commanders for the truth. If they had surrendered, you would have said so. It is inevitable. If you will surrender to me now... your lives will be spared. Look, friend, you're the prisoner. And as long as we have you to work over, we still have a chance. Lamont, Dr. Penner, we'll continue on with the tests. You will die, then, as all the rest of you shall die. Dr. Penner and Dr. Lamont began immediate... experiments in a desperate effort... to make the invader visible to the human eye. The vast scientific knowledge of the two men... was put to the test in a race against time. For they knew that with every moment of failure... thousands more people all over Earth would die. Time was running out for the defenders. The world was nearing the end of its ability to fight back... for this was the third day. By midnight, the human race on Earth would cease to exist. They still trying to batter down the door? No, they gave that up. But they're still out there. Probably trying to figure a new way to get at us. That thing in the chamber knows we're trapped and that we can't get out alive. If we surrendered, you think they'd let us live? Maybe. We won't know if we don't try. All our experiments have failed. Why wait? We're not giving up. Or do you two go along with him? Major, we've tested everything. Light rays, every shade on the spectrum... chemicals, mechanical devices, nothing. We can't make it visible, we can't hurt it. I asked you a question. Do you agree with Lamont or don't you? I don't know. I'm too weary to think straight anymore. Look. We can't hold out here forever. Let's take their offer. See what happens. Look, the three of you. That thing in the chamber is bluffing. The very fact that he's offering us our lives if we stop the tests... proves that we're on to something. And he's afraid we're gonna find out. You're a fool. We're no closer now than we were an hour ago. You do what you like. I'm taking the offer. I'm letting that thing out of the chamber. Make him stop. John, I think we've hit on something. - What, Dad? - The creature. You heard the alarm bell on the radiation counter. The explosion and concussion made the creature react. Nothing else has. React? We've been looking the wrong way for our answer. It isn't in light waves or chemicals. The answer is in sound! - Sound, John! - Sound to create sight? You said the device used by that creature that came to your house... caused a humming sound. Yes, the sound was low-key to our ears... but the device must've used sonic rays. Sound vibrations that created resonance... with the basic molecular structure of the metal ore. And that resonance caused visibility! I just hope it isn't too late. Sound is the answer. He certainly reacted during the explosion. Listen. When the chemicals in that flask hit the panel... it caused a short circuit... jumped the breakers and blew up our entire air-conditioning and filtering system. Luckily, our radio's still intact. - How long can the air last? - An hour and a half. Then we'll have to open the air vents. We'll be sitting ducks for what's waiting for us outside. Major, I want to apologize. It's all right. Forget it. Look, if you think sound is the answer, you better make sure, and fast. There. That ought to do it. Now, both these pieces of equipment are identical. If one doesn't generate enough sound, we'll use both... and probably break our own eardrums. - Nothing, nothing at all. - Keep going. Major, there's your weapon. It not only makes the invaders visible, but destroys them as well. Could the army turn these out in a hurry? I could give headquarters all the details in a few minutes. Good. Come on. May Day Homer, this is Able Fox Niner Six, over. Able Fox Niner Six... There's a high-powered jamming signal in the area. - You think the invaders are doing it? - Deliberately, to kill our broadcasts. The spaceship must be close by. We could use the jamming signal to find the spaceship... by tracking it on the direction-finding radio in the truck. Yeah. That'd be our only chance to get your information to Gen. Stone. Yes. But what about the invaders waiting for us outside? We're gonna crash right through. If you have any prayers for a job like this... you better start saying them. After you let us out, get to the transmitter. When the jamming signal goes off, call the General in a hurry. Good luck, Major. Don't miss with the sound gun. It's the only chance you have against radiation. Okay, Dr. Penner, open her up. The radio jamming set up by the invisible spaceship... was the only key to the location of the ship. The directional-finding equipment on the truck operated by Dr. Lamont... had to use this key successfully... or all hope would be gone. Slowly, but surely... the radio jamming led the truck to the immediate area... of the invisible ship used by the invaders. Hold it. May Day Homer. This is Able Fox Six. Come in, please. May Day Homer to Able Fox Niner Six. Come in, Able Fox Niner Six. Come in, please. In the United Nations building in New York, a special meeting was called. Present were Dr. Penner, his daughter... Major Jay and Dr. Lamont... to receive grateful thanks from the countries of the world. Earth had been on the brink of disaster. But out of the holocaust of war... in which a dictatorship of the universe had been defeated... a lesson had been learned. The nations of the world could work... and fight together, side by side... in a common cause.
