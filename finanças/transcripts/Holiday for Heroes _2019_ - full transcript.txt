RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM Thank you. Look at this. Let's see what we got. Bring enough for the whole class, Devin? Absolutely. My sister goes above and beyond. How about you? Get anything from home? This is home. Enjoy. Sergeant Evans. From my sister's coffee shop in Branford. She roasts it herself. You'll love it. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Dear Miss Brown, I hope it's okay that I'm writing to you. Your brother Devin gave me your address so I could thank you for your amazing coffee that he'd shared with me. It reminded me so much of home at the holidays. I'm trying to ration it out so I can extend my Christmas into January and February, maybe all year. Dear First Sergeant Evans, I'm so happy you like the coffee. When it comes to Christmas spirit, I operate at a 10. I try to stretch out the season as best I can, but by February I already miss it. I don't want you to have to ration your coffee, so as long as you promise to celebrate Christmas every month, I promise to keep sending more. Take care, Audrey. I'm doing my best to keep up my end of the bargain here. This month I celebrated by gift giving. Red barn coffee went with me into a village today and helped me make a few new friends. Let's just say your coffee is an international success. You may want to prepare for some more orders. Your caffeinated pen pal, Matt. Four specials, you got it. That's amazing news! We've been talking about expanding the business. Maybe we should take it overseas. My Christmas in July trick is to sneak over to the local hockey rink real early with my skates. The ice always has a way of bringing me back to Christmas. I'm so jealous. I'm a true Minnesota boy, so I could live on the ice. Take a lap around the rink for me. I need it, 'cause Christmas in September has been a tough one to come up with. In times like this, I think of George Washington crossing the Delaware on Christmas night. I'm gonna borrow from his brave example. Thank you for your letters. They mean a lot out here. I love that you're so into history. My dad was the same way. It's officially November, so decorations are going up, and I start planning the Holiday for Heroes event again. It's our way to thank the local service men and women and give presents to the families in need. It's the highlight of the Christmas season here in Branford. Can you believe it's coming up on a year that we've been writing? It went by so fast. Anyway, I'm glad you've enjoyed my letters. It's been great hearing from you as well. Let's keep the tradition going, shall we? - Morning, Carlos! - Good morning, Audrey. - How ya doin'? - I am fantastic! You know, your artwork just gets better and better every year. Why thank you, Audrey. So I brought you some extra decorations. You didn't have to. I know you're busy. How's our Rosa doing, by the way? Six weeks to go. Juliana has a countdown going and everything. I'm doing the same thing for Devin. Good. I can't wait to celebrate them at the Holiday for Heroes Party. It's gonna be amazing. Because you make it amazing every year. It's because I have an amazing caterer. Well he does make a mean tamale. Speaking of, I'm gonna need to sample those very soon please. You got it. - How about tomorrow? - Sounds like a plan to me. - There you go! - See you then. All right, we'll see you. Dear Audrey, as much as I would like to continue our letter writing tradition, I'm afraid I won't be able to. Don't worry, it's good news. Hey! You are never gonna believe where they're sending me to finish up. Where? Branford. No way, that's crazy! I'll be there for Christmas. - Well I'll see you back home, huh? - Look forward to it. My first stop after work will be your shop. Can we have a cup of Christmas in December coffee together? This one's on me. Audrey! - 11 days! - 11 days! - I'm so ready to have Keenan back. - I know. I plan to spoil Devin rotten this Christmas, partly because I need his help decorating the barn, but mostly just 'cause I miss him so much. You haven't decorated? Who kidnapped the real Audrey? I know. But I just didn't want to do it without him. What is this? Merry Christmas. Can I pick 'em or what? Yeah. Sure can! No, I'm good. Thanks, okay. Did you know the dress shop was relocating? They must have moved out overnight. We're thinking the same thing, right? All of this space? I mean, we could do everything we've been talking about. Break through the wall, connect the spaces. Let's go back. Do you think we can afford it? Doesn't hurt to ask. Okay, I'll ask Luke about it tomorrow at the Christmas tree lighting. Are you ladies talking about me again? - Hey, Luke. - Hi, Luke. Sorry, I couldn't resist. - The usual? - Yup. Hey. But seriously, is there something you wanted to talk to me about? Yeah, actually, it's about the space next door. - We're thinking about expanding. - That would be amazing. I am totally booked up today and tomorrow, but I could show you around Wednesday, noon-ish? Yeah, that's be great actually. It's a date. What do you think? It's perfect, right? Let's put some lights on it. Is there anything more romantic than a decorated Christmas tree? Still writing your pen pal, I see. I'm just finishing my to-do list for the party. Pen pal? How do I not know about this? - We're friends. - Maybe. But you look forward to his letters. Real life love letters? That's even more romantic. Okay, I've never even met the guy. Besides, he stopped writing me. - Was he hurt? - No. No, nothing like that. I asked Devin. Maybe he's planning to show up here and sweep you off your feet. Okay, can everybody just relax for a second please? I have too much work to do than to focus on that stuff. Besides, he's thousands of miles away. Your office will be over there, Evans. Now, I know this is different from your positions in the field, but we need a hand with per stats. Personal statistics? Great. No, I have a little experience there. Well, we have some new regulations. Familiarize yourself with those, will ya? Yes, sir. Evans! Are you kidding me? Oh, come on! What am I, back in basic? - Thought you retired, Tom. - From the army. Teaching high school now. - They got me coaching hockey. - No! Well what are you doing here? I'm trying to get the brass of public affairs to sponsor us. That's great. How long have you been in the States? Long enough to unpack. I got a month left on my contract. And they put me here. This is not the Evans I know. Right? But... It is nice to be stateside for the holidays. Yeah. - Hey, you played hockey, right? - Lakeville High. Two-time Minnesota State champ. - Still bragging about that. - To anybody who will listen, buddy. Well hey, I got a way for you to relive the glory days. Why don't you come help out with the team? They don't need a Second Drill Sergeant. No, I think they'd really benefit from someone that knows the game. I mean, I was pretty good, but I wasn't All-State. Playing to my ego, huh? - Is it working? - A little bit. Yeah, that would be great. It would be fun to get back on the ice. - Yeah, thanks. - All right! - Practice tonight, six o'clock. - Tonight I can't. I have a... Meeting with someone. Okay. - Tomorrow, 18:00 hours sharp? - I'll be there. - All right. - Good to see you, Tom. Have a great day. I'll have a cup of your Christmas roast to go. Got it. There's no charge. I really appreciate that. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. That's more than double what her coffee would have cost. So generous of her. Let's add it to the toy drive donation box. Pay it forward. I like it. Jade, we should really go back to storage and look at the books. I say we call it the conference room. - It sounds classier. - Your silly! I don't know, Nathan. You might need to wait until your father gets back. But my paper's due before then. You know I'm only helpful with the math. Hey, what can I get for you? I'd like a cup of the Christmas roast. - I hear it's best in December. - Yeah. Can I get a name for the order, Sergeant Evans? It's Matt. Coffee's free for servicemen. I'll call your name when it's ready. You know, as a history buff, did you know that this building was used as a munitions stockpile during the revolutionary war? No. But I bet my boss does. Audrey! You must be Pam. Wait. Are you psychic? No. Is everything okay? Yeah, the Sergeant wants to tell you a historical fact. What was it? - Matt? - Yeah. I can't believe I'm actually here. - Is this your pen pal? - No. Yes, but I don't call you that. It's all right. I don't mean to act surprised. It's just been a while since I heard from you. - Since like September, right? - September? You didn't get the one that I mailed last month, saying I was stationed here in Branford? That's amazing, but no, no, I didn't get that one, no. Well then sorry to just show up and surprise you. It's okay. I love surprises. I do. - Should we sit? - Sure. What a great place. I mean, I didn't know how to picture it. - Probably bigger. - No, not at all. It's perfect. So, you're stationed here now? Until I figure out what's next, they gave me a desk job over at the base, which I wasn't expecting, but I was happy to get the opportunity to come here, and have a cup of coffee, and meet you. It's nice to finally be face to face. I know. And now that you're here, you can come to all of our Christmas events, especially the Holiday for Heroes Party. I was secretly hoping to get that invite. Are you kidding? Of course. So? What do you think, a 10 out of 10? It's better in person. It takes me back to Christmas morning. See the snow falling on our porch. At your grandma's house on Orchard Lake. You remembered that. Nice! Yeah. What about you? Well, mostly it just makes me think of Devin. It's his favorite. Devin's a great guy. Great soldier. I was proud to serve with him. Excuse me. His ears must be ringing. That's so funny. Hey! Devin, you're never gonna believe who I'm sitting with right now. First Sergeant Matt Evans. That's great. Hey, Audrey, listen, I need to make this quick. I'm so sorry, but we just got word they need us in the field here a few more weeks. I won't be home for Christmas. How long will you be delayed? Not sure, but it's the same for the whole company. Well, this is for sure? I mean, we have so much planned for everyone. It seems pretty certain. We're just undermanned right now. But I'll check in again in a couple of days, okay? - Love you, sis. - I love you too, Dev. Sorry. I'm guessing you know exactly how this feels. All too well. Hey. I understand, you have a job to do. Yeah. Don't worry about us. I miss you, dad. Yes, sir. You okay? Yeah. You know what? Go ahead, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go unpack. But I would love to continue this. That sounds good. Maybe I'll come by later. I'd like that. All right, half ice drill, then we pack it up! They look good. Yeah. Except for Nathan. He's a little off today. You know, he just found out his dad's not coming home for Christmas. I'll talk to him. Hey, how'd your meeting go last night? - It was good. - Yeah? Until she found out her brother wasn't coming home either. That's rough. How do you know this girl? We were writing letters back and forth while I was deployed. Emails? No, no. Actual letters. And as it turns out, she wasn't expecting me, so I caught her a little off guard, and it was... - Awkward. - Yeah. What are you thinking? You can't show up unannounced. Cut me a little slack. I haven't done this in a while. I think it's great you're making the effort. You know, I knew we wrote back and forth for a year, but I met this girl one time, it's like I know her forever. - But I should've called? - Yeah, yeah. What's that Winston Churchill speech you were always quoting? Never give up. Never, never, never. No. What he actually said was "never give in". Never, never, never. In nothing, great or small. - You know what I mean. - I know what you mean. - All right. - And I will not give in. Good. All right, let's go boys! You're closing already? Sorry. Christmas tree lighting tonight. That's right. It's Jade, right? I'm Matt. Nice to meet you officially. You too. You know where Audrey is? I was just trying to catch up with her. I'll give you one guess. Tree lighting. Right, yeah. That was stupid. You're gonna be keeping an eye on me, aren't you? I respect that. We're gonna be friends, me and you. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. Hey coach. Hey! There he is. Hardest working hockey player we got. Got a good kid here. So, where would I find this tree lighting? You want to walk with us? Thank you. Yes, the Holiday for Heroes Party is still on. It's gonna be great. Everything's going according to plan. - It's exciting. - Hey! Zoe! Hi! - Hi. - Hi there! I'm so sorry about Devin and the rest of the company. Thanks. On behalf of the hotel, I want to let you know we are fully onboard to have the party. I really appreciate that. Even though we're missing some of our heroes, I think it's really important that we celebrate them, you know? Are we still gonna have the toy soldier dance? - That's my favorite! - Well we're gonna try our best. Enjoy the tree lighting. Audrey! Hey, Luke! Hey, I'm excited for our date tomorrow. I know, me too. - You guys are gonna love it. - I'm so excited! I can't wait. You're gonna be big time now. We have some exciting Christmas activities that involve a lot of calories. We've got the s'mores festival happening on the weekend and in Murray Park, our traditional Christmas caroling downtown on the 17th, and our classic traditional egg nog competition on the 21st. Plus, we've got ice skating and sleigh rides happening downtown all month long. Did she forget the Holiday for Heroes Party? Honoring our daughter and the other troops? That's our favorite part of Christmas. Are they not doing it this year? I'm sure she just forgot. - Are you ready to light the tree? - Yeah! Five, four, three, two, one! Mayor Fielding, mayor Fielding, mayor Fielding? Hi, hi. - Audrey. - Hi! You forgot to announce the Holiday for Heroes Party. Yes, my office was supposed to be in touch. The council voted to cancel the party this year because of the extended deployment. Well, does the city still plan to match the donations for the toy drive? That's the most important part of the event. I'm afraid not. The families will be so disappointed. Yes, but the council thought that the families would be more disappointed if they had a Holiday for Heroes Party without the heroes in attendance. Well, did you ask them? I'm sorry, Audrey. It's been decided. Hi, everyone. I'm Audrey Brown. Some of you may have noticed that Holiday for Heroes was not announced this year. The town has decided not to sponsor it. But that's okay. I am speaking for the planning committee when I say we are going to figure something out, and we are going to find another way to honor our heroes. I don't know exactly what that is yet, but if anybody has any ideas on how to plan something for our troops and support them during this difficult time, you can come to the Brown Homestead on Old Oak Drive this Saturday. And I will make sure to brew you lots of coffee. And... Excuse me. Hi. That's great to hear, Audrey. And Luke Montgomery Realty is gonna be sure to sponsor whatever you decide. So bring your good ideas and your holiday cheer, and we'll figure something out. Yes. Thank you for stepping up last night at the tree lighting. I don't know what I was thinking. You were thinking that it was wrong for the city to cancel the party, and you wanted to do something to help the local families. This girl got herself into a situation, didn't she? She does that a lot, doesn't she? Here it is! - There's so much room. - Yeah. The refrigerated pastry counter I've been wanting, it would fit right here. Goods could finally get the space that they deserve. And we could like to build a stage over here and invite local musicians to play. I like it. Hey, Luke? Do you think the building owners would let us tear down this wall. Yeah, I'm sure they'd consider it. In the meantime, here are the specs and the prices on the space. That's more than I was expecting. Well you guys are in a longterm lease nextdoor, and the prices have gone way up since then. They could honestly get that or probably even more for the space. Okay. I'll put in a good word for you if you want to make an offer. You've been really good tenants for them. What do you think? We've been wanting this for so long. We have to try. Yeah. All right. Think of what the best offer you can make is, and I'll pass it along to the owners. - Okay, yeah, we can do that today. - Yes! And now, as someone who is committed to the cause, how can I help with this planning meeting? How quickly can you make a flyer? Planning party at your place. How fun is that? Do you want me to cover the shop while you're at the meeting? - Would that be okay? - Yeah, of course. But, wait, just remember, whatever you plan, I have dibs on decorating. Done. Are you expecting someone? Every time that door opens, you light up like a Christmas tree. I don't know, I thought Matt would come by again. He did. The night of the tree lighting. I showed him to the town square. You didn't see him? No. Nathan can show him the flyers. He's helping coach Daniels with the hockey team. You want to write a letter on the back? Very funny. Actually... I'll take it to him myself. - How do you get so much power? - You gotta lock your elbows, right? So the stick flexes against the ice. You see that? 'Cause then that generates a lot more power than we can do on our own. All right, here. Come on. Look, what you gotta do is you think of your stick kinda like one of those medieval catapults, right? Like you crank back that wooden arm. That way, when it releases, you knock down the castle gate. All right, come on. Nice! That was great! Did you feel that? Yeah. All right, way to put in the work. Good job, I'll see you tomorrow. Hey coach, seems like you know a lot about history. I would hope so. I majored in it. Jared Franklin and I are study partners, and we're way behind. - Any way you could help tutor us? - Of course. You guys figure out a day that works for you, and we'll get it done. - All right, cool. - Good job today. - You did great. - Thanks. - This is a nice surprise. - I told you, I love surprises. Well, except for this one. The city is canceling the Holiday for Heroes event. But I still want to think of a way we can celebrate these families. Your insight would be really valuable if you can make it. - Of course I can make it. - Great. And I'd love to still find that time to talk or do something else, do something christmasy. Well the ice is free now. 'Cause wasn't this your Christmas in July or something? Yeah, that's a good memory. Where are all the decorations? I know this is a hockey rink, but this place is like a four on the Christmas meter. Oh, right, 'cause you only operate at a 10. Thanks. Well. No, honestly, I'd love to, but I have to get back to work. But some time, yeah, sure. - I'll hold you to it. - Great. Okay. I'll see you Saturday. Who are you gonna spend Christmas with since I can't be there? Don't remind me. Hey, you can see the mantle, right? I hung up our stockings. It looks great. But I'm serious. I don't know. Maybe I'll open up the shop for people like me who want a place to go. - Did you put the tree up yet? - I can't do it without you. - It's tradition. - Don't wait. This is your Christmas too. I want you to be happy. Listen, don't stress so much about them canceling the event. We all still know you're thinking of us. But you deserve so much more. What are you talking about? You spoil me rotten. I get so many care packages over here that I end up sharing 'em with half the guys. Doesn't everybody get care packages? Not the Audrey Brown treatment. Well they should. I know what that look means. Just promise me you won't pull a full Audrey and spend so much time worrying about everyone else that you forget about yourself. Hey, I gotta go. But I'll talk soon, okay? - Love you. - Okay, I love you. Be safe. - Bye. - Bye. Jade. How quickly can you make 12 dozen snickerdoodles? Audrey, Jade. Audrey, did you organize all this? With the help of Jade's amazing baking skills and wonderful volunteers who brought donations. I'm gonna find a home for these. Hey coach! Hey fellas. What's going on? Let me see that. Your friend's here. Matt. - Hi. - Hey. - I'm glad you could make it. - Me too. That looks familiar. Hey, would you let me embarrass you for a minute? That doesn't sound good. Coach! Coach, coach, coach, coach, coach, coach! Could I get everybody's attention, please? Thanks so much. I just wanted to thank you all for coming to our little planning party, which then turned into our little care package party. And I wanted to introduce you to First Sergeant Matt Evans, who recently returned from Afghanistan. I was hoping you could tell us a little bit about what the care packages mean to the troops. Honestly, they mean more than you could ever know. And it doesn't matter how big or how little. Just knowing that someone back home is thinking of you can make your whole day, or even your whole holiday season, because the reality is, is that not every soldier gets something for Christmas. I know because I was one of them. Until Miss Brown was kind enough to remedy that, and it changed everything for me, so I think this is a great idea that you're doing. After hearing that, I think we can all agree that no soldier from this base should go without a care package this Christmas. Yeah. I've gathered a list of all of the names of those serving who are from Branford, so let's get packing! And make sure you add a personal note. It really means a lot to them. Be sure that you tell 'em that everybody back home is okay, that you're happy. It gives them the security and the peace of mind to go out and do their jobs without worrying. 'Cause if you ask them, they're gonna tell you that it's the families who are back home keeping everything together who are the heroes. Which is why we should still throw the Holiday for Heroes Party, in honor of all the heroes right here in Branford. - Who's with me? - We are. I mean, it would be a lot of work, especially since the city's cut all of our funding, but... - I'll provide the food again this year. - And I'm all over deserts. I'm pretty sure the hotel can still donate the event space. - You know I'm great at flyers. - Amazing! I mean, we're practically halfway there. I would just need some help with planning and logistics. I can do that. I can help with the planning, logistics. Thank you, great. All right, everybody, spread the word! The Holiday for Heroes Party is officially back on! And I just still have to check with Zoe to confirm that we can use the hotel. I have a confession. What? - I know nothing about planning a party. - Really? I just said that I would help so I could spend a little time with you. Well I'm really glad you did. 'Cause you're not the easiest person in the world to get ahold of. What? Okay, I admit I have a hard time sitting still, but I just figure if there's work to be done and people in need, I might as well do it. Best prize life has to offer is the chance to work hard on work worth doing. Teddy Roosevelt, and I totally agree. Yeah, Devin says I do too much. But he's off defending our country, so he's one to talk. - You and Dev seem pretty close. - We are. Our parents passed away when I was 18, he was 12, so I feel like I raised him. That was quite the responsibility. That changed your whole life. He's my brother. He means everything to me. Well, besides maybe being the best sister in the world, what do you do for fun that's not tied to committees and party planning? - I do fun things. - Like what? Like... Tonight actually, there's this Christmas event in town. Do you want to go with me? - I would love to. - Okay. After we finish this very important planning session. I like your attitude. I just want to make the party great this year. So many people can't make it. It has to be extra special. I don't even know. - I think I did it wrong. - No, it was good. Hey, Carlos, question for you. We're talking Holiday for Heroes. What is the best part of the event for you? Besides the toy soldiers? It's really fun. No, but honestly, the best part is when they honor my daughter Rosa and all the troops. It unites the families, makes them strong. Hey, I got something for you. Hold on, stay right there! You know, I haven't been to a place this fun for Christmas in a long time. Yeah. So what did you usually do for Christmas? Well, I spent a lot of those years writing papers every spare moment I had, trying to finish my degree. And then, after that I would find all the guys who couldn't go home for Christmas, and we would celebrate. That's nice. So what are you doing this year? Are you heading back to Minnesota? My grandma passed away about 10 years ago, and I've been overseas ever since. So, I just don't have an emotional connection there anymore. But what was that... What was the thing Carlos, the toy solider thing Carlos was talking about? Is that like a revolutionary war reenactment. - You'd love that, wouldn't you? - Yes I would! I hate to disappoint you, but I think we're gonna have to cancel it this year. I should take it off the list. Wait, you haven't even told me what it is. Well, every year some of the local troops do this really great marching routine dressed in the uniforms, dressed like toy soldiers, the big hats, the red coats. It's super charming. All right, okay, these are for you. I want you to drink this and tell me what you think. - Is this your eggnog? - Oh yeah! And I put a little extra hint of Mexican hot chocolate in there. Ooh, a little kick in there. I like that! - Do you think it needs more cinnamon? - Maybe a pinch. Sadly, I really shouldn't. I'm judging the eggnog competition this year. I need to remain impartial. I am not a judge, nor do I need to remain impartial, so I want hers as well. There you go. That right there is the Christmas spirit. So the Christmas thing that you invited me to tonight, what's that all about? Well let's just say if you like Christmas before, this is gonna make you like it even s'more. What is all this? Just some extra firewood and blankets. You aren't related to Florence Nightingale, are you? I can't help myself. I don't want anyone to be too cold out here. Okay. - We can rest this here if you want. - Yeah, okay. Yeah. Hey there. We will take the jolly Saint Nick package please. Where are the toppings? Over there. And there's a lot of options. There's peanut butter, there's chocolate covered Espresso beans. People here get really creative. I am an expert at this. Let me make you one. What would you like? Surprise me. Meet me in 10 minutes. - Hi. - Hey. All right, close your eyes. Okay. And open. How am I supposed to eat this? Oh no! It looks good though. That's good. I might eat one more bite. - What is in this? - Peppermint bar, chocolate drizzle. This is like a 10 on the Christmas s'mores scale. You have to try it. I don't think I'm ever gonna be able to eat a regular s'more again. Do I have anything on my face? No, it's perfect. Me? You're good. But you know what? If we don't have this after eating s'mores, we're just not doing it right. So true. How am I? - Pretty good. - Yeah? Yeah. So, how'd you get pulled into coaching the hockey team? Assistant coaching. Tom asked me to. You know, I was raised by my grandma, and a coach stepped in and it really made a difference for me. Paying it forward. I like it. Military school in Virginia, huh? Never saw you as the teaching type. It's just an interview, sir. Well, your leave is approved, but your commander may not write your letter of rec. And why is that? Come on. You know he wants you to reenlist. Army always needs good men like you in the field. You can teach when you're gray like me. Evans. Think about it. - How cute is this? - I love that one! I had a collection of angels growing up. I myself was a snow globe kind of girl. You and Devin both. My parents used to give him one every Christmas. After they passed, I kept up the tradition. You know, you're a really good sister. Well, I had a lot of support. This whole town was here for us. That's why I want to give back. I mean, this toy drive is so important to so many families. Hopefully some more donations will come in soon. Without the town matching the donations, we're not gonna come even close to what we're used to. We're doing the best we can. You know what, I'm gonna talk to Zoe tonight. Maybe she can leave a donation box at the hotel. And maybe Luke can leave one at the office. And I can call the local news station. Maybe they can do a story, and it'll raise awareness. I'm sure everyone would love to help, but don't spend all your time on this. You should enjoy the holiday too, you know. Well, my way of enjoying the holidays is making sure everyone else enjoys them as well. You certainly help me to enjoy it. Especially with Keenan gone. It's Matt. Well, pick up. - Hey. - Hey, how are you? I'm great! I'm here with Jade. We're wrapping gifts for the toy drive. Nice. Hey, I was wondering if... You would want to join me for a skate tonight. - I may even have a surprise for you. - Tonight? - I have to work on these donations. - Actually, I'll do that later. I'd love to go with you. You know what, actually I'd love to go. Yeah? Great. Well maybe we meet at the rink around six? Okay. I'll see you then. - See you then. - Bye. Are you sure this is a good idea? We only have a week. Audrey, I love you, but you're in desperate need of a night to relax and have some fun. Keep 'em closed, closed. Slow down, slow. And... Open. It's amazing! You did this? I had a little help. By the way, the hockey moms can do anything. It's beautiful. Well, we started at a four. - But now? - An 11. Definitely an 11. Ready for that skate? After you. - You having fun? - Yeah. - Are you? - It's perfect. Actually, this isn't quite your speed, is it? You used to being out here with a stick in your hand. Feels a little wrong. Right. Okay. I'm game. - Let's go. - Really? Come on, coach. Show me you skill. So that's pretty much it. You want to try one? Sure. All tied up. Ambushed. That changes things for me a little bit. Two-one. Devin was the first freshman to make varsity. I am a hockey mom. Yes! Two-two. Looks like we're a pretty even match. Tie breaker? Game on. - Let's go. - Okay. Come on. So there's this Christmas caroling event tomorrow. Would you want to go? I wish I could. I'm leaving for Virginia tomorrow. - What for? - I have a job interview. A history position opened up at a military school down there. That's amazing. Good for you. We'll see. I'm not sure what's gonna come of it. But hey, I will be back on Wednesday if you want to do something then. Sure. Well, why don't you let me do something for you then. What was the thing you missed most when you were overseas? Food. Traditional American food. Like hamburgers? Yes, and mac and cheese, and fried chicken, and Turkey, and everything. Okay, well, why don't we make dinner at my place? - How's Wednesday? - Seriously? Yeah. Yeah, I can't wait. Thanks. Merry Christmas, everyone! I have great news. Took a little Montgomery magic, but the owners accepted your offer. That's great! Now there's still the cost of opening the wall, which they won't cover. Okay, so what do we do now? I already called my contractor, and he's gonna be giving us a bid this afternoon. - Luke, you are on it. - Thanks Pam! What's all this? We're starting a donations board for the Holiday for Heroes event if you don't mind spreading the word. Sure. How is your helper working out? All of my helpers are working out great. Thanks. Well, you have my number, just in case I can help. Bye. Yes! - Sergeant Evans. - Commandant. - So glad you could make it. - Thank you for inviting me. - What a beautiful campus you have. - Yes, it is. - How you feeling? - Great. - Excited for the interview process. - That's over. The history faculty was convinced form the moment they saw your resume. I mean, you're a decorated soldier and you finished your education in the midst of your service. You're exactly the kind of role model we want. Now, I'm ready to offer you the position, but before you take it, I want you to really think about your decision. I will, and thank you. Sir, it would be an honor to be a part of your team. Well, that's not the decision I want you to think about, Evans. Sir? I spoke with your company commander, and he had nothing but great things to say about you. He told me you're an excellent leader, a team player, and he doesn't want to lose you. I'm not telling you to stay in the army, Matt. I'm asking you, before you say yes to this job, to be certain. So tell me, are you certain you're done with the army? So, we're gonna start decorating the ballroom on the morning of the 20th. That gives us less than a week to get things organized. Until then, if you want to pledge any donations, feel free to just write them on the snowflakes and pin them to the board. I'm gonna help the kids build gingerbread houses at the party. I think the hotel has some mini tables in storage that we can use for that. Nice! I'll take photos of the kids. Ooh, we just need a Santa. So, let me know if anyone knows of someone jolly enough for the job. I'll do the banners again this year. - Hey, I think I'll help you with that. - All right, there you go! It's gonna be great. Hey, do you have a minute? The contractor's here. - Yeah. - Great. But here's where you need to make a decision. Now, unfortunately, this is a load-bearing wall. It separates this space from your store. I can open it up for you, sure thing. But it won't be cheap. Can you give us an estimate, Pete? I can put some numbers together for you. - Any other questions? - Yeah. Have you ever played Santa? All right, there you go, Don. Thanks for coming in. Hey, tell Patricia I said hi, okay? I can't believe you asked him that. Why? He's adorable. And he was thrilled to do it. You have a one-track mind, sister. Pam, we got you a Santa. It's a Christmas miracle. Wish he could put a load-bearing door on his sleigh. And... You've got mail. - Was it from Matt? - It's the missing letter. Dear Audrey, after 20 years in the army, I'm at a place where I have to make some big decisions. But you'll never guess where they're sending me for my last month of my enlistment. Branford, Connecticut. I'm not sure where life will take me after that. I have an interview at a military school in Virginia for a teaching position in the history department. As you may guess, that's pretty enticing. But the army is also pushing pretty hard for me to reenlist. I don't know, but I have 30 days in Branford to make that decision. And in the meantime, I'm really looking forward to meeting you in person, Matt. - Welcome back! - Merry Christmas. What could it be? Come inside, come in. Thank you. Matt. I got your letter. The lost letter. Telling me you were coming to Branford. It came? So, you only have 30 days here. Even less now, actually. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I should have. Sorry. It just never felt like the right time. I've just been having so much fun with you. Yeah, me too. So tell me about your interview. I bet they loved you. They offered me the job. That's great. And does the army still want you to reenlist? Yeah. I'm getting hit on all sides with that one. You weren't kidding. You have a lot of big decisions to make. It's overwhelming. Well, what I always do is make a list of pros and cons. I can help you with your list. Did you just go into planning mode for me? I guess I can't help myself. You know what, Audrey? I actually would really like your help. Okay. But tonight, I just want to set that stuff aside and be here with you. Is that okay? Sorry I didn't say anything. Toast? To finding our happiness at Christmas. And all year long. Okay, now what do you want to do? Do you want to watch a Christmas movie or maybe go out and take a walk in the snow? Actually, Devin said that I ought to do something, and I think I'd like you to help me if you're up for it. Lead the way. Bet you didn't know I was that good with an ax. Yeah, you were like Robert the Bruce from the Battle of Bannockburn out there. - I'm guessing that's a good thing. - It is. I can't believe I'm in the actual barn from the coffee bag. Yeah. When my great-grandfather bought this land, he couldn't afford to build a barn and a house, so he built the barn first. That Christmas, everyone gathered in here and they put up their tree, and their tradition stuck. That's so great. Hey. You okay? I'm in here every day roasting the beans. It's just, with the tree it's different. It's the last thing we did with my parents that night. We all decorated the tree together, and I stayed here with Devin, and they went to a party. The weather was nasty. There was ice and wind on these windy roads. The other driver just lost control. I'm sorry. I thought that I would hate Christmas after that. But I couldn't do that to Devin. So I... Overdid it every year. I wanted to make it as fun for him as possible. But the tree, that's... The tree's always really hard. That's why I always do it with Devin. Except this year I don't have his help. He's turned the tables on me. He wants to make sure that I still do Christmas even though he's not here. And I'm honored. Where should we put it? - You okay that I put that on? - Of course. I'm glad you feel at home. Comfortable, I mean. Come here. Happy? It's perfect. Want to dance? Matt. - About the job offer. - Let's not talk about that now. I just... Want to say... If you have to leave, I'll keep writing you. Me too. So you bought her a hockey stick for Christmas? Is she still talking to you? - She's incredible. - Well Annette wants to meet her. She's been bugging me to have you over. How's Friday? I can't Friday. I got a meeting at the base. You know, I took a look at that new SRB they sent out. You thinking about staying in the army? Of course I am. That's all I've known, what I'm good at. You take that signing bonus, that's three more years in, first year overseas. I know. I just... Want to make an informed choice. Hey, Matt, long-distance relationships are not easy. But not impossible. That's how Audrey and I started this whole thing. Yeah, sure. But things are different now, right? Look, Tom, obviously I would love to stay here and play this out with her, but I gotta work. Right now I have two great options. It's just, unfortunately they're both taking me down a path that's away from her. Well maybe there's another path. Hold up! There's only eight snowflakes up here. Why is it still so empty? Everyone seemed so excited. Give it time. Hi ladies. I have that estimate for you. Thank you. Is this where you volunteer to sign up for the Holiday for Heroes Party? I already signed you up to be Santa. Yes! And on top of that, my wife is making pies. She's a middle school teacher, and the kids are really excited to help out. Can she make copies of these? We'll take all the help we can get. Thanks. And let me know if you have any questions about that bid. Bye Santa. See? It is going to happen. The party maybe. Okay. And he even comped his own labor. - It's just so expensive. - We do have some savings. No, our savings are going to the chairs and the tables at the new space. Plus we need the refrigerated case. What's really bothering you? What if I'm falling for Matt? And he decides to move to Virginia next month, or he gets deployed again? Can I tell you what I learned being married to Keenan? - Yes, please. - You can't live in the what-ifs. Instead, I have to live in the what-I-haves. And what I have is pretty great. I have Keenan, even though he's far away. I have Nathan, I have you, and this shop, which is great, whether we expand it or not. And we have... Pies, and a really jolly Santa, and gingerbread houses, and a photographer, and help with set-up and tear-down, and something else I can't read. And of course a beautiful venue, and a few days to round up whatever else we need. With Matt, just enjoy what you have, and let it build from there. Okay. You know, there's one task that we've been neglecting for the party. Are you serious? What? - The toy soldier routine. - I don't know. All the guys that used to do it are overseas. Everybody seems to love it. I'll get guys from the base, and we'll learn it. You're gonna do it? Why not? Is it hard? It's like a whole dance thing, you know? Like the tin soldiers. Like the robot, like... Arms down! Those are some good moves through. I think it's our turn. Here. - Thank you. - Okay? - Yeah. - There. - Hey! - Hey! It's perfect! You made this? Rosa told me I needed to paint more. I love it. Thank you. Let's stick it over there. Thanks guys! - Hey. - Hi! Matt. You made it. - We're just getting started here. - Great. You okay? Yeah, yeah. Listen. - I just had a conversation... - Audrey. I'm so sorry. Can I talk to you for a minute? Of course, Zoe. What's up? Not here. Can we step outside? Okay. Hey coach. Gentlemen. I'm glad to see you're here giving a hand. Coach, what would you say is the reason Hamilton endorsed Jefferson in the election of 1800? Great question, because Jefferson was in the opposing party as Hamilton, right? What was that? What's going on? Guys, I know you're not over here talking early American politics. What's going on? Jared and I told the guys about how you helped us, and they wanted to soak up some of your knowledge before our big test coming up. Well what do you say we put a little team study group together? That sound good? - Yeah. - Yeah. All right, we'll do that. Hey, can I get everybody's attention? Really fast. There's been a bit of a scheduling mix-up. A corporate event has this space now, so... Long story short, we can't have the room, so we have to move out. - When? - Immediately. So, if everybody doesn't mind gathering up their stuff and putting it in boxes, I'll hold onto it until we find a new venue. Where's Zoe? I'll talk to her. No, she feels awful. She's practically in tears back there. I think tonight all we can focus on is just packing up. Thank you so much. You can just put it in the truck. I appreciate it. Okay, we're good in there. Is this the last of it? It should be. Hey, Audrey. For what it's worth, I think sometimes we have to give ourselves permission to fall back and regroup for the next mission, you know? Yeah, but I don't have anywhere else to go. It's so last minute. I mean, canceling this party twice? - That sounds devastating. - I know. But we will find another place. Thank you. What were you trying to tell me earlier before Zoe walked up? No, I'll tell you later. It's okay, no, it sounded important. What was it? I just had a meeting over at the base, and they want me to reenlist for at least another three years, because they want me to be an officer, and they're gonna pay for my officer training and... It's a big offer. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Look, why don't I just, I'll follow you back, and we can get this stuff unloaded. You know what, that's okay, I got it. - What, no, no. - Yeah, I... I just want to go home and watch "it's a wonderful life" and recharge. I'll see you later. Okay. - Devin. - Hey. It's so good to hear your voice. What are you up to? - I'm in the barn. - Did you put the tree up yet? I did. Actually, Matt helped me. Oh, he did, did he? Devin, everything is going wrong. Matt may be reenlisting, we can't afford to expand the shop, we lost our venue for the Holiday for Heroes Party, and I have nowhere to put all of those people at the last minute. Are you laughing at me? Well I can't help you with the first two problems, but the last one is pretty simple. What do you mean? Audrey. Take a look around you. Our family has always had Christmas there. Why not share it with the community? Oh, well Dev, I mean, this is our special place with mom and dad. Letting Matt in was one thing but... What would mom and dad have done? Fill the barn with Christmas, the way it's supposed to be. - I miss you so much. - I miss you too. Good thing I called to save the day, huh? Funny. Hey, I just got the time's up signal, so I gotta go, but I'll talk to you again before Christmas, okay? Okay. I love you. Love you too. All right, talk soon. Bye. I'm so glad your barn worked out. I felt terrible about what happened. I'm happy to host. Hey. Luke sent you this. - Congratulating you on the expansion. - That was sweet of him. - I'll put it on the counter. - Thanks. All right, let's see. Okay. This attendance list just keeps getting longer. Almost every family in town is coming. I'm worried we're not gonna have enough gifts for the kids. My favorite part of the night is watching their sweet faces as our Santa gives them all their presents. What happens if we run out? We've had collection boxes in almost every business in town, but I think people are tapped out. Right. I just wish I had more to offer them. Unless... I'm sorry, can you excuse me for a minute? Jade? Conference room. - We could match the donations. - What, how? With the money with saved for the lease on the space next door. It would mean we'd have to wait longer to expand, and we'd probably lose the space. Bu I don't know, I've been thinking a lot about what you said the other day about how we need to focus on what we do have. I totally agree. What's a few more months of us having to squeeze ourselves into this back room if it means we get to honor these families the right way? You're the best. You know that, right? I've heard. Good job. - This is a special place. - It is, right? It's the first place that's felt like home in a long time. I'm guessing that's not just because of your new running partner. He's all right. There's something with Audrey, something I've never felt before. I just don't know i f she feels the same way. Well I think you should ask her. Okay, look, the problem is I don't know if she's into me or this other guy, Luke. - Montgomery? - Yeah. From the For-Sale signs? No, don't worry about that guy. - You just, you worry about yourself. - I'm trying, it's just... You know, I get these two great job offers, and my head tells me that I can't pass those up, but yet it feels like I need to stay here and see if something happens with us. I think you should tell her that. I think you're right. It's pretty good. Let's cheers it. Bring it. Green to green. Perfect. That one's gross. Okay, everybody. The top three entries have now been sampled, and it's time for the judges to submit their final votes. - There you go. - Hey. Are we all going out after this? I have to talk to you about something. I'm all yours. Did you get those flowers I sent? I am so excited for you guys. Yes, that was so, so sweet of you. Actually, that's what I have to talk to you about. And the winner of this year's Christmas eggnog contest is... Carlos Gabon! I did it! Thank you, thank you. I'm the eggnog king! Thank you, honey. Thank you so much. Matt! - Hey, Pam. - Can I... Have you seen Audrey anywhere? I can't get ahold of her. She's judging the eggnog contest tonight. Right. Did you know that, although they taste terrible, carnations are entirely edible? Where is the eggnog contest? Downtown bar and grill. Hey, let me get you a free latte. No thanks. Matt? - Thank you. - Thank you. So what's up? Jade and I can't afford to lease the space next to ours right now. Is this about the renovation bid? No, that was gonna be a challenge, but... The Holiday for Heroes Party is really important to us. So we've decided to use our down payment money to cover the extra expenses. I know, you probably think we're crazy, but we both agree that the community really needs it right now. You're an amazing women, Audrey. You know that, right? I wish I could hold the building for you, but it's not my call. Are you sure about this? I am. Okay. To what might have been. What might have been. Don's meats is donating pigs in a blanket, 500 of them. Look at all these snowflakes. It's like a blizzard in here. How did this happen? Apparently Luke told his colleagues about the wonderful sacrifice his client was making for the military families and that they should help out too. Well that was very nice of him. This one's new. Matt put it up a while ago. It got moved around when you put the new sign up. You haven't seen much of each other since then. Not at all, actually. Jade, I don't know what to say to him. It's okay to tell him what you want. He hasn't told me how he feels. Well what's important is how you feel. I adore him. - Then why haven't you told him that? - Because it's scary. Yes, it is. - But I can be brave. - Yes, you can. Matt. Matt Evans. Meredith Franklin. It's the principal of the school. Her son Jared's on the team. Of course. Nice to meet you. Jared tells me you helped him with his history paper. A little bit. He and Nathan were struggling in that class. To their credit, they came by and asked for help. So we stayed after practice and worked on their papers. And when he finished, you read it and gave him feedback? On Jared's, yes, he asked me to. My son has never gotten an a in his life, and definitely not in history. Good for him. Obviously he has it in him. The boys work hard for Matt on the ice too. He's good with them. He's tough, but he's kind. We're in good shape this season. - Sorry, did I do something wrong? - Quite the opposite, Mr. Evans. Coach Daniels tells me you've been offered a job at some other school, but he'd prefer to keep you here. Oh, he would, would he? If you're interested, come by my office sometime soon. I'm sure there's something we can work out. I will, thank you. Thanks. - Looks like you got another offer. - Thanks for doing that. Well, maybe you can see things through with Audrey now. She's not interested, Tom. You saw her talking to another guy. What's the big deal? It's more than that. I haven't seen her since the night of the borrow. You told her you might be shipping of for three years. What kind of message did that send? I got a text that said, "sorry I'm so busy". Come on, I can read between the lines. Matt! Don't make tactical decisions based on hearsay. First get your intel correct, soldier. Over there is perfect. Can you believe all the help we're getting? It's so inspiring. I can't believe it. It's all coming together! Hey, you haven't seen Matt yet, have you? No, and you just asked me 10 minutes ago. Did he say he was coming? Well, I texted him the info, but he didn't reply. You need a more direct approach. What are you doing? Jade? Jade! He's responding! I need to talk to you too. I can meet you there in 15. I can hold down the fort here. Hey there. Hi. I'm sorry that I haven't been in touch lately. I just... When I heard you were leaving town, I guess I was just trying to protect myself. I get it. Audrey, listen. Look, if I'm not... If you're interested in somebody else, you can just tell me. Who else would I be interested in? Well I saw you at the bar with Luke the other night. He's my realtor, Matt. It's obvious he wants to be a lot more than that. Luke is a really nice guy, but he's not for me. I mean, he spends more time on his hair than I do. And he certainly wouldn't do the robot in public. Matt, we weren't on a date. Can we start this over? - Yes, please. - Great. Hey. - I'm Matt. - Hi. We've been writing letters together all year. Okay. We're going that far back. - Yeah, why not? - Okay. - Well, Matt, it's nice to finally meet you. - Nice to finally meet you too. - Would you like a coffee? - Great. Okay. You know, those letters really got me through, made me feel like I had someone to come home to. Audrey. I thought about you every day. - And now... - No, wait. I have to say this. Matt, I love talking with you, and dancing with you, and making s'mores with you. And I would really love to spend Christmas with you. But I can't ask you to stay. You have to decide that for yourself. But I can tell you how I feel. And I am falling for you. It's Christmas every month of the year. They're beautiful. When I was overseas, you were my angel. And you still are. Audrey, you don't have to ask me to stay, because I've already decided to stay. Because I met this girl. And there's no way I can leave without giving it a chance. Life is full of little surprises. And I have a couple more. I gotta go. You're leaving? I will see you at the party. Wait! Can I at least get a hint? Nope. This is so exciting! Why are we here? Mysterious meetings in the middle of the night. - What's this all about? - I don't know. - But why is it a secret? - Is it some kind of town emergency? Why did you call this meeting? Well, I didn't call this meeting. - Who did? - My new friend, Matt. Thanks, Luke. I wanted to ask all of you for your help. Okay. Hey, come here. - How you doing? - Good. What would you like for Christmas? I would like a half pony and half unicorn. Okay. - Let's take a picture on that. - Say cheese. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Hey, buddy. So gorgeous. So did you all try the tamales? Thank you. Merry Christmas. It looks great in here, right? But seriously, I mean, you're not gonna believe me, but December is the month to buy. Congratulations, partner. - We know how to throw a party. - We really do. I just wish they could all be here to see it. We'll send them lots of pictures. Okay. - I am finally ready to enjoy myself. - This I have to see! - You look great. - You look great. So does the barn. - What are you up to? - What do you mean? Matt Evans. Would you let me embarrass you for a minute? What? Can I get everybody's attention please? Welcome, everyone. This is my first year being a part of the Holiday for Heroes Party. While we will still have a lot of your favorite moments, we decided to flip the script a little bit this year. Now, we all know Audrey Brown. Who works so hard every year on this party. You know, usually she's up here, giving a beautiful tribute to those whore are serving in the armed forces. Today I stand here as one of those soldiers to give a tribute to her. Audrey, you have such a giving heart. You go above and beyond to make things special for others. We all know it, and we all wanted to say it. These are cards thanking you for everything that you do for us at christmastime and throughout the year. But that's not all. We also have something else we want to give you. In case you hadn't heard, Audrey and Jade put their dream on hold so we could be together tonight. They used their savings to cover the extra costs of this party. You have both taken care of all of us over the years in different ways. And so now it's our turn to take care of you. We present to you the newly expanded A&J's coffee shop. The town pitched in to cover the renovation and the first year of the extra lease. I can't thank you all enough. You have no idea how much this means to us. We love you, Branford! Now let's get back to some of our favorite holiday traditions. Ladies and gentlemen, march of the toy soldiers! Devin! Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome home the entire 192nd Infantry Battalion of the Connecticut National Guard. Why didn't you tell me? I was going to, but since you love surprises, Matt and I decided it would be a lot more fun this way. Well done. Great homecoming top. Thanks for putting it together. I can't believe it! You've made this the best Christmas I could ever possible imagine. - I can't believe you did all this. - You deserve it. - I do have one more tiny surprise. - Okay, now you're just spoiling me. I just took a job teaching at the high school. In Branford? I'm staying here. But you can write me a love letter anytime. RIP-FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM
