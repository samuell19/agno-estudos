This is not happening! Now let's see. Why can't I make a simple call? Why can't I get a taxi home? Is it too much to ask? This is a special night... The Three Wise Men don't attack people... no-one sets fire to an expensiv e car... and it's flies that smash into windscreens, not killer Santa Clauses. That's what flies are for... I want to get out of here... I hav e to find Okamura-san. What we did to him wasn't right. No... Because your partner... Partner? Sav iour more like... You don't cov er him in food, you don't giv e him an exploding cigar... You act as host to your partner, and you suck up to him. So that he'll sign the contract. And your family won't find out... Your wife won't know about your girlfriend... On this special night... why did my daughter... my little girl... get pregnant by a buffoon? Lucía, I'm sorry... Marta, darling... Teresita... So... sure you hav en't got a coin? Ernesto, what's going on? I'v e nothing left. I'm ruined... and that's it. Another phone!

I'll go and look. - Don't mov e. - Now what? Nothing. You stay here, we'll look for dad. And leav e me alone? There's no point in going out there. Crazy or not, you father will manage. Come and see this. "Suffer little children to come unto me." You'll be safe here. I'll look for the maniac. Look who's talking. Your father. He'll probably kill you when - he sees you. - Really? Yes. I'll risk it. And if he does kill me... My brav e rescuer, they'll hear you. "God be with you, dear heart, I must away." I lov e thee. - I'll bring you strawberries. - And cream. That's it. I march... into battle! Well, well, well! With this and your present, we're all set up. Mr. Cuspineda. It's you. It must be past midnight. Probably. - Where are the girls? - They're safe. Good, good, good. Okay. Well... my friend Luismi and I hav e found a way to get out of this hellhole. Right, Luismi? Though with my bad luck... But this time it'll work. Will this be heav y - enough? - What? - Shit! - Good. - It's working! - Look what you'v e done! Let's find them. - They'll be worried. - That's what Teresa wanted! Ernesto? Inside! THIEF Let me down. I only wanted to make a call. I'll pay for any damage, but let me down. Let me go, you fool! - Teach them a lesson! - Rabble! Quiet, they'll spoil my costume. You'll hit me too! - Isn't this getting out of hand? - No! The orphans without toys! String them up! Let them pay! But they swear it wasn't them. The Three Wise Men? That's some story! No hangings till they say where Luismi is. - And the toys. - Didn't we say that the first thief we caught... Come on, ev erybody wants to hang them. - Wasn't he your boss? - Exactly.

Which one? My little girls! We were so worried about you. - Mov ing... - Yes, v ery Christmass y Very mov ing. - Now take us home. - All right. It was frightening too, but we're back together, so let's get out of here. Wait. Jaime went to look for you. - He must hav e got lost. - He found me. - He did... - So where is he? Back in Madrid. Someone gav e him a lift back to the theater. No. He'd tell me first. When Trifino got here... I was worried so I came to look for you. Since Trifino and I were there, he decided to leav e. J ust like that? Why didn't he say goodbye? If I remember right, he said, "Behind me... - lie feasting and libations..." - "Feasting and celebrations, friends and riv als. On the lips of the storm. I go out to my destiny, to seek glory. Behind me lie my home and my history..." Yes. That's his style. Don't stop! - The killer Santa Clauses! - It's ok. Ev erything's under control. Sign here. Merry Christmas, Noel. Es at your serv ice. Now the presents. From one who lov es you. Madame. This is for you. - Into the car. - Is that it? Into the car. - A fine couple. - She's not interested. Ev en I ended up liking you. Come here! Great! A PlayStation 2! Ernesto, Lucía, a PlayStation 2! Marta, a PlayStation 2! Quite a surprise, eh? Trifino, where are we going? To the Garrigas' for a minute. What? No way. - Take us home, Trifino. - That's what it is... A home from home. - Ev ery cloud has a silv er lining... - Sure. And someone always sav es your skin. TRIFINO GARRIGA INVITES THE CUSPINEDA FAMILY TO A PARTY AT THE FAMILY MANOR FORMAL DRESS AND PUNCTUALITY REQUESTED Family, here we are. A few knocks but safe and sound. Grandmama, mama. Diana. Your father asked for you. Twice. Anyway, the main thing is you're here now. It must hav e been a terrible night. And the girls... poor things. You must be Marta, - right? - Yes. Eugenia? Yes? Papa, I can explain... We're late becau... They must change. Martín, prov ide them with garments. The master's? That's v ery kind but... Your size, I think. Very good, sir. Now for Marta, with her wonderful figure, something of yours or mine would do. - Find her something. - Yes, mama. This way, Marta. Teresa, go with your sister. This way, if you please. Valentino, Yv es Saint Laurent, Hungaro, take your pick. What lov ely clothes. And now you. All that grime must hide a pretty face. Let's go and wash. You wash. Come along, and while your sister's changing, we can go out and look for shooting stars. Would you leav e us? You go and look. If you see one, call me, okay? Marta... You know those things in your wardrobe? Yes. - What about them? - Well, you see... I stuck a pin in them. I know. They were always the same ones. The good ones are in a safe place. Come here, shrimp. I'm your older sister. You'll nev er get my room, you hear? You hear? Let's get out of here. Hurry up. Don't make them wait. Ernesto... I'm not going to strangle you. Take your time before you go down and dazzle them with your charm. Ask yourself why your oldest is expecting a baby, your youngest is obsessed with blowing ev erything sky-high, and why I... Well... That's all I ask. Think before you do anything. At least, until you come up with the answer. A celebration! Thank you, papa. Many thanks. - Good ev ening. - And you too, Ernesto... A celebr... Martín! Always in the way. Papa, tell him the good news. Trifino has told us what happened at your firm's dinner tonight. Ev erything? Indeed. A memorable occasion. Now... tomorrow is a holiday, but the next day I'll transfer funds... To Refrigerasa and Garriga Electronics. We're sav ed! I said ready or not here we come. At last. Ladies, if you would kindly follow me. You should see her. She looks gorgeous. And for me to say that... She looks incredible! She looks beautiful! Like a princess. Stop. Not another step. Not another step. "I'll not offend thee more with words. For my death speaks for me. - Great offence I did thee..." - She prefers Jaime. She really likes him. I know. "My tears shall I now in silence shed, for whosoev er dies silently, has someone to speak for him." Ernesto, you know, nothing would please me more than to form part of your family. Marta, please accept this, as a token of what I tried to tell you before. I want you to know... I lov e you. Will you marry me? Congratulations. Welcome to the family. - You're a sly one... - We're sisters now... My boy, I'm v ery proud of you. A fine couple, Mr. Garriga. That's for sure. Call me by my first name. We'll soon be chasing grandchildren together. Sooner than you think, Garriga. And than I'd hav e - wished for. - At last. My girl's expecting a baby. Ah, hence the urgency? You're a dark horse, you rascal. This is the only way. Unexpected, but wonderful news. So soon... Don't congratulate Trifino. It's not his. That problem... until the 12th week has a solution. You know, Garriga, I'd rather you hit me, I swear I deserv e it. How could I sell my daughter for an air-conditioning plant? I'd rather die than let a bastard like you... ex cuse me, ladies... dictate my family's future. Come on, Garriga, smash my face in, you rotten coward. Hit me! I nev er expected less of you. Come, Cuspinedas. Trifino, you're the only decent member of this family... Dad! - Jaime! - Marta, my lov e. That father of yours and Trifino left me as a hostage to a pack of ps ychopathic killers. Thank God I was rescued. I thought you'd left me. Would I do that? All the way here I was thinking... how much I lov e you. And we'll talk about the baby, okay? And strawberries are out of season. No! It's not fair. You can't prefer this... ham actor to me! - This clown who isn't worthy of you. - You're hurting me, damn it! Enough, Trifino. Marta. - Trifino. - Trifino. Jaime, my darling. Ernesto. Ernesto. It's a Noel 7. Double delayed action. Now the fireburst. Acoustic annulment. And the final surprise. Martín, throw out the trash. That's not necessary. It'll leav e by itself. Trifino, I'll take the Mercedes. If anyone had the last word, it was your sister. But who'd trust a teenage princess pregnant - by a sad clown? - Teresa! Dad! Must be the orphanage. Sign! And sign about the table football. It's the Three Wise Men! - Our toys. The... - Three Wise Men had them. They had them! Careful, dad. First fix things with the Jap and then with mom, okay? I most humbly beg your pardon - for tonight, Mr. Okamura. - Cuban. Light it up. Go ahead. Go on. It wasn't for me. Ernesto... that is, your husband... - bought it for you. - I bet he did. Read the inscription. "Lov e." I'v e giv en your husband a lot, but nev er that, I assure you. It's a present from him, not you. How could anyone lov e them? - They're ridiculous. - That's just it. Call me at the hotel tomorrow. Okamura's room. Put it with the other presents at home. Fiv e meters! Fiv e meters. One... two... Teresita. See you next year. Don't worry, you're much better than that old drunk in the red suit. What a nice girl you are. Did I stain you? Luismi, where hav e you been? Can you tell me the way out of here? Come on, Agustín. They just stole the car. Don't get upset. I'm not. But they stole the car! Don't get upset. - But... - Don't get upset. But... Don't get upset, don't get upset. I'm not getting upset. J ust leav e me alone. I'm sorry. It wasn't our car anyway. J ust as well.
