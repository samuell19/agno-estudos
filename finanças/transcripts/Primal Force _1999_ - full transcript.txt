Mister Brodie? Alright alright Mister Brodie? Is he there? Frank Brodie? What are the charges? Name is Scott Davis, there's a plane that's gone down on San Miguel Island. Locals tell me you're the man I need, I understand that you used to lead expeditions on Mister Brodie? I'm told you know that island better than anyone. If we left right now, we could have those people out by nightfall. We've got a boat now. Now you're trespassing. Drop the gun. Mister Brodie, this is a crisis situation, and we need your help. you know that I used to lead expeditions there, right? Mister Brodie Why did you have a pilot fly over an island and restricted airspace? Is that why you can't go to the Federales? That's not relevant to this mission. You don't want to go to that island. You got no idea what you're getting yourself into. Look, I have important people on that island, and every minute we waste talking... They are dead. Not until I say so. If you change your mind, you know where to find us. Nice place you got here. Thanks. Told you he would come, they say he's crazy. That's what they call the guy around here, we'll take our chances. Of course, out of range. My father is going to kill me, I wanted to announce this by noon. Mister Deutsch, you really should stay still. You're probably in shock, you probably hurt worse than you know. Good, if that's the case shoot me now. Look, I'm going to go try and find us some water. We should be okay if we stay hydrated. Excuse me, hello? I think we've got a slightly bigger problem than whose thirsty. Help is on the way, Miss Cunningham, there's no need to worry, I called in the Mayday we have a rescue beacon working. They'll be here in a couple of hours. I'll give you one and a half. What? This sucks, man. You don't know my father, he's going to think I made this whole thing up, just to avoid work. Let's turn the gain around on the feed if we can. Okay, that's good. Let's see what we've got. Bingo, this hasn't been surveyed recently, no maps available. Interesting. How the hell are we going to get in there without a guide? This place has no maps, going in blind. Mister Davis? Hi Tara. I'm ready. Here's the medical kit you asked for. Just throw it up front for now. Buena Suerte, this is Rescue Center, we are still showing a code red alert. Time from impact is now 2 hours, probability of survival has decreased 20%. What are we waiting for? Remember that it's for 8 hours, then it's going to be double, If we do it now. Then shove off. Okay. Forgot to mention what this gig pays. You're late. Dug me. Brodie this isn't an arms shipment. Who do you work for? I handle special assignments for the man who's buying the island, his daughter was on that plane. He didn't know what's on it. He's turning it into a resort, that's all he told me. What do you got for weapons? Weapons? This is a rescue mission. I got a SATCOM link, MREs, GPS, thermal recon, We are set. That island was abandoned and put off limits for a reason. They didn't tell you any of this? Animal testing. Man, you must have really pissed somebody off. Because they just sent you on a suicide mission. Buena Suerte this is Rescue we're now approaching a restricted area outside San Miguel Island. Start your sweep over target sector, continue heading 2 3 0. Mister Davis, how's this? Got it down to the bare minimum. That's going to slow us down. I assure you, I can handle my own under any circumstance. Tara has worked with the village doctor, she'll come in handy. That's fine. We need a medic Brodie. signor Davis, this is as far as I can go, see? I wait here, I'm sorry, Brodie. Brodie come on. Maybe we should go look for him. He'll be back like he said, we'll be out of this before we know it. Look while we're waiting, why don't we just finish this up? All you got to do is sign this inspection agreement, and the island is yours. I want to talk to my father first Your father... I know your father trusts you Kelsey, and this deal was almost finished anyway. At a time like this and you're trying to close the deal? What the hell is that? Run I thought you said they were no animals on this island. I thought you said they were no animals. You can't just leave me here. John Hey Lg secured, recon back here at 9:37 Code word and frequency the same? Everything goes tight, back in 2 hours I'll buy. I heard that. Everything's packed, all ready when you are. Kovacs will stay behind, he's got the SATCOM, we'll replay by walking. He has a gun? There is a speargun in the truck. Kovacs? You know how to use one of these? For what? You could kill a rhino with this thing. No actually you couldn't make sure it's loaded. Try to hit what you aim at. Thanks, I guess. Do you know what that is? Nothing storage shed. All right, stay close and follow me, you're not separate from the group for any reason, is that clear? Brodie in this mission, you're an advisor okay? Never leave anyone on point without gun. Mister Davis I think this was a gazelle or something. Yeah but, this wasn't. Brodie, what are you doing? Thought I saw something. We're going to have to cut through the jungle. You said the river was shorter. The other way is faster. The other way being the road that I wanted to take. Send your family to San Miguel Island, It'll be the time of their lives, they'll never want to come back. In fact, you'll never hear from them again, I can see the brochure now. Listen I'll drop the price, and I'll hire somebody to go through the place. Like who? I don't know, like the marines or something, Right? An American oil company is going to pay the government to exterminate an island in Mexico. Yeah, it wouldn't be the first time. Anybody there? Hello? Just the wind. There is no wind. Let's go back. How far? I figure about a kilometre. Kilometre, give or take, We won't make it before dark, I guess we will, we're making good time. Eddie, do you copy? We're going to need the infrared, Looks like we might not make it before dark, Eddie? Right here, sir. Radio works What was that? Look at the size of that thing. Do you see anything? No. Let's go. Mister Davis, just in case. Thanks, Eddie. Don't thank me, thank god that wasn't us. Base to point, Davis do you copy? What? You are going the wrong way guys. Say again. We have a new fix on the transmitter, behind you, not in front of you. We must turn around, you're moving off course guys. That's impossible, we had our position locked in. Kovacs what's the new course heading? Change course to that's impossible. What is it? It's moving. It's not moving. It's moving, sir. All right I want you to do a thermal recon scan, set your coordinates to the initial point of contact. Do you copy? Over. Copy that, standing by for thermal recon launch, airborne in 30 seconds. Okay, we have contact, I read two subjects at ground zero, about half a mile east of your position. Check that. There should be three, well now I read five. Five? That's not possible. Well it looks like, there is at least 30 of them. It's getting dark. Do we have a survival plan? If we do, it's in a plane. You think it's safe? Something moved, there Maybe we should be able to fire. All right, I've got the survival kit. god, wish I had my nine millimetre Yeah, carry a gun? Yeah, I carry a gun, I didn't think I needed it here. What, is that noise? I don't know, I'm going to find out. Okay, we got a first aid kit What are you doing? Leave us alone you bastards. Contact 10 o'clock 30 degrees north. This is it, they're alive. Why don't you follow me now? Anywhere What the hell is that? Let's get in the plane. Heads up people, I see the wreckage. It's two survivors. Hey Brodie, what the... Have you lost your mind? You ever did that to me again, I swear I'll kill you. You guys okay? Are you alright? Where is the third? where is the pilot? I think he's dead. He's over there. Davis, what was that? I don't know, ask Brodie. I bet she won't see that in National Geographic. That's it Kovacs, two survivors. Copy that. Pilot missing presumed dead cause unknown. We need to get going now. Hey, I am not dragging these guys to this jungle in hike. We can't give them any more time, they'll get organized. What are you talking about? You want to tell me what the hell you think is going on? They're trying to kill us, that's what they're bred to do. You don't get your people out of here now, it might be the only chance you get. You're telling me that we're going to die if we don't leave tonight? Come on, Brodie. You're not going to get very far even if you do, these people are in no condition to go anywhere. All right, two things. One, we are not going anywhere. We are staying here, we leave at first light. And two, all that matters to me is getting my people off this island. Unless it's related to my mission, I don't want to hear about it. Ok that's it, cynocephalus, the dog headed monkeys. This is a Savanna baboon, and the largest is a Chacma. The average male grows up to two or three feet in height, weighing around 40 to 50 pounds. But these baboons are 5ft tall, I mean, they must weigh 100 pounds at least. Some of them went up to 250. Smart enough to hunt you down and kill you. Nice campfire story Brodie, no animal hunts man. I don't know Davis, Grizzlies have been known to stalk men for days, weeks even, till they drop their guard. But these, nothing hunts like these. They'll try to divert us, split us up. And they'll gang up on the stragglers. Probably go for the legs, You fall and you can't get up because your nerves have been severed, and they go for the kill shot to the head. These are fearless warriors. Kalahari bushman admired them for their strength, the Egyptians worshipped them for their intelligence. And the Greeks? Greeks just called them evil. This is a whole other animal. Once they find you, they won't stop because they can't. There were 70 different species of animals when I left here. You think the baboons killed them all? I don't see them, do you? Sure. One day job in and out, no problem. never working with this guy again. Brodie, god you almost gave me a heart attack. What are you doing here? I couldn't sleep, I thought I'd go for a walk. No I mean, what are you doing here? What do you mean? You always answer a question with a question? The village doctor doesn't have an assistant not for the last ten years. What do you know about this place? I want to know what happened here. Why? Nobody else does. You care, I mean if it's so terrible, why did you come back here? There you go, asking the questions again. Look, nothing personal but is none of your business, okay? Okay. It's just that next time you take a stroll alone, will probably be your last. We leave everything here. That is like $1,000 suitcase. Not any more. Is there anything else you want to tell me about this place Brodie? Don't fall behind. I'm just the advisor here, remember? A resort, can't wait to meet the idiot came up with that idea. That would be my father. You know why they are try to unload this place? Of course, she does, this place is going to be the next Cancún. Like five star... I'd love to see you Brodie present Lady, your old man is getting the deal of the century. This was going to be the ultimate game reserve, we bought everything off the black market. Big orange sheep, tigers, everything. and we thought, what would someone with way too much money give for a real hunt? You know, like man hunted 300,000 years ago. So we found this scientist who was able to genetically enhance the animals to make them harder to hunt bigger, faster, more vicious. First month, three hunters were killed. Six months later, the death toll had reached 20. But then the animals were the hunter and we were the hunted. Did you know this? No, Technically there are no laws here governing this kind of activities, but... I don't get it. What was the sport hunting a baboon? Not exactly a big game. They were just lab animals for the initial tests, but they became insane with a desire to kill. They escaped. We thought the other species would dominate them. So in other words, this island is like Chernobyl, and we're like waist deep in radiation. Yes if you get to play the bonus round. Base camp to point, come in point. Come in. Go ahead Base. The boat's gone, sir. What do you mean the boat's gone? There is no radar and I can't raise them on the radio, is gone. The boat is gone, sir. All right, keep trying. We're heading straight back, so we'll be there in a couple of hours. Copy that. Better tell him Kovacs, keep an eye out for Baboons. Baboons? We encountered one last night so just in case, keep your gun ready. You're kidding me. Look, they might be dangerous, okay? So just shoot if you have to, you hear me? okay, we'll be there as soon as we can, sit tight. Base camp to Buena Suerte, do you copy? Over. Please respond, over. Sorry, dude you gotta chill. What is it? We're too vulnerable here. I've never even seen this guy before, right? Everybody okay? Yeah. Eddie? Yes Watch your backs. Like monkeys did that? Let's keep moving. Brodie, listen to me, I want to make you a deal, okay? You tell these guys that you make us whole thing up, I mean you can tell them anything else. If you just do me a favour and you keep quiet about all this Planet of the Apes garbage, then when this deal is closed, and I mean it's going to be huge, I swear to you, then I guarantee you a percentage of the profit I mean, we're talking six figures here, right? So you've got my word on this. What do you think? Stay to the left is more open. So anyway, I'm talking to this guy, right? It's all about real estate at that point, he doesn't even have any knowledge on how zoning works. I said what I care about is he tried to build anywhere like within 5 miles of where I'm going to build. You got how many million? Like 8 million? 10 million dollars? Hello? Hello? Where is everybody? This way god, don't do that to me, I hate that you gotta a chill, dude. Where were you guys, I was looking for you. They split us up see what happened? We got to go back, before he is history. What do you mean, is he dead? Davis, is he dead? Where's Tara? Was she on radio? Tara Tara, do you copy? Tara, do you hear me? Do you copy? Over. It's her. Wait Brodie, Brodie. Tara, please respond. Tara do you hear me? Over. This is San Miguel island to Buena Suerte, do you copy? For anyone in the media, please respond, over. It's broken. They took her Are you sure? What are they going to do to her? Brodie, is she alive? You want to get home? Now's the time to get the hell out of here. We're not going anywhere until we find her. You can bet your life you're going to do it without me. Yeah and you've been such a big help too, I'll take my chances. Give me 30 seconds, and I can pinpoint any air breeding target on this island. for what tell all the toys of yours. Is that what happened last time? Did you leave your people? Turn your back when they needed you? Huh? Davis are you okay? I guess you did. With or without you I'm going. You are a fool. Hell, you should have known that the minute I let you on this mission. Base camp, base camp do you copy? Over. Roger, minor spacing go ahead Request a thermal recon on these coordinates, Copy points tell me what coordinates. I know where she is. Check that Base, be advised we are proceeding to unknown location. Roger point, can you state purpose. To locate and retrieve missing member of landing party. Stay with Eddie Okay, easy boy I just want my gun back. No problem. So that's it? That's it. Is best I go in alone. I don't make it shoot anything that comes out of there. How many do you figure are in there? One, two? Less than a million. Well then like everything else on this island, I'll just figure for the worst and double it. Now you're getting it. Here, I want you to take this. Stay on channel two, the reception is going to be like crap in there. I can't talk to you, but I can hear you, in other words, it won't be any different from the way we've been communicating. Hold on my calls. Brodie Are you okay? Yeah. What are you doing? These tunnels are all dead ends, they got to come through here if they want to get out. You're going to blow it up? You got a better idea? Do you know what this can mean? They are developing at an incredible rate, they're nearly Neanderthal. So get out of here before they get cable. This is not funny, If you knew they were going to bring me here, who knows what else they're capable of. After I pull this we got 10 seconds, get out of here. You know I used to love going to the Zoo, but after this forget it man, I am like never going back. What happened? Are you guys all right? We heard this... We got 6 hours of daylight, we can make it to the beach if we hurry. Back through the jungle? You know a better way? And then we go home, right? Set up a perimeter, we wait for rescue. And then we'll go home, right? Well I guess Kelsey, that's right, this nightmare is about to end. Base camp, base camp do you copy? Over. Kovacs, come in. Kovacs? Nothing, maybe we are too far, maybe the batteries are low. Kovacs? When I find this baboon I'm going to waste his ass. Great, now what are we going to do? I want to go home. Relax. We still got a chance Kelsey. We're out of chances. There has got to be a way off this island. Not without the boat. No, they're here. The boat is here, they'll be here. Just calm down. We're going to get us killed, all of us, you're in over your head, we all are. My father will pay you. He'll make you rich, whatever you want, just please get me out of this place. Mister Davis, we still have the life-raft Which of us gets to go home? It's only good for two people. Someone can swim alongside. Oh, yeah the Sharks would love that. Then I'll go, I'll get help someone will find me. My father will not leave me here to die. How will he know? The pilot called for Mayday. They're going to make it look like an accident to protect their stock. They're going to sweep it under the rug. Like they did 10 years ago. What about the lab? What about the Lab? It's just up over the hill, right? The storage shed. What's up there Brodie? Even if we got it working would be history before anybody got to us. Got what working? There used to be a transmitter. Brodie let's recon ahead, check things out, you two stay here with Eddie. Shortest way is through the grass, right? Jungle on either side, given the odds, I prefer the grass. Doesn't make any difference. It's level, no trees overhead, no rivers to cross, We can make it. Haven't you figured it out yet? We're not getting off this island, we got no food, no water, no communication. We're running out of ammunition, and there's more of them than there are of us, it's not a question of making it. This is how it ends. All I need is some time, you find me some cover, I will figure a way out. You don't fool me Brodie, you didn't come back here to die, you came back to end the nightmares. Okay Eddie, bring him up. Okay, we're moving out. All I need is one shot at those monkeys. Eddie, what's that? Come out you son of a... Say it again, Eddie? Eddie, what's your point Eddie? Davis, I think I'm going to need a little help guys. Eddie? Eddie? Eddie? Eddie Davis? Something is coming Something is coming Stay close Go, go, go, go Eddie I can't move my legs. You're going to be alright. I got him. Eddie Lift him up, get him out of here. How far Brodie? Top of the Hill. Oh, god. Still behind us. There is a generator in that shed, I might be able to get it going, still plenty of fuel. Transmitter looks intact, if we can get juice up there, I can get us picked up, if I can get a call-out. Yeah, but how long do we have? There was like a ton of them back there. They won't attack us while we're in the open. They'll go back to the others and wait till night. We got to get Eddie somewhere, he's lost a lot of blood. We're not safe down here that's for sure. Hang on, you're going to be all right. We got to sit him down. This place looks more like a bunker than a lookout town. Asme? It's a blow torch. Looks like whoever was here last left in a awfully big hurry, ten years ago. Coming back to this island is probably the stupidest thing I ever did. I doubt that. All right. It's dead My peers in the profession informed me that it would not be possible to breed animals to become more aggressive predators. They ostracized me and called me irresponsible, too radical banished me from their lofty halls of learning with a sign around my neck which read extremist, and to them, I have but one thing to say. Being an extremist is the only way to discover where the boundaries of what is possible truly lie. Clearly, my tests show that there are no limits to what we could do here. Somebody will recognize what I'm doing here is Nobel Prize calibre work, and if they don't, radical, they don't know what radical is, I'll show them radical. Radical is their way of drawing a line between themselves, and what they cannot comprehend. They have no concept of the courage it takes to tap into the primal fear of another living creature. Turn it into a force of fury, with one pure purpose to survive at all costs. No bother with the social order of the group. No bother with the thousands of needless minutia that clutter up our lives. Wives, children, family, friends, imagine the pureness in that. By increasing the DNA strength in these animals, I have accelerated the breeding cycles to a level of nature itself would never have achieved. I have stared into the face of god, and guess what? He blinked. Run for days if the bills all that. Good, I'm just trying to find the antenna cable. Do you think we should put a lock on that? Lock isn't going to keep him out. You wanted to know why I came here, the man you worked with, the man who leaves me this legacy, it was my father. I came to the village four months ago, nobody would take me here. They said it was cursed, I almost gave up. The plane crashed, and I had my chance. Just wanted to know, I wanted to know if it was true, what my mother told me it was true, alright. He had plans to experiment on human next. He's going to give the local village kids vaccine shots, that were really a DNA boost. How far is he going to go with all this? I mean, he lost his mind? Crazy is a bad bug. I didn't know, just like you. The son of a bitch wouldn't come with me though. Left me to live, that's not what I wanted to say. We used to sit around at night having a cigar and a snort he liked to say, it ain't broke, let's fix it anyway. What the hell? Son of a bitch, left me to live. I can still hear the screaming, Maybe he was a lucky one, he died. I don't know, I was just thinking, this is, this is like a second chance, I mean I know we can never wipe them out, but I couldn't save the father. And maybe he learnt or the screaming. Both all those people I left behind. Okay, we're in business, people. Mayday, Mayday, do you copy? Over. Mayday, Mayday, this is an emergency. Does anyone read me? Over. This is a distress signal, we are five survivors in need of rescue, does anyone copy? Over. Yeah, you got SS Blue Horizon here. we can read you, can you state your location? Over. We are in the southwest corner of... Did we lose power? What happened? It's not the power. Maybe it's the frequency. They're here. Now, don't shoot unless it's a kill shop, Otherwise it's not going to last very long, it's all the ammo we got. Hey Davis, put the girls in the back with Eddie. I was thinking the same thing. Just give him this, Eddie, just in case. I just want to say we're going to make it. Thank you I'm not very good with these things. Think of something you hate and blow it away. Guys who show up late, bogus family functions. Watching your father try to impress his lame friends. Figure for the worst and double it. More than two, less than a million. Eddie, breathe. Eddie, breathe Stay down Freaks All right. Eddie? The antenna is useless, we can't fix it because they chew through the wires, No more ammunition left. We can't fight off another attack. Now what do we do? It's over. What's so funny? We let them What do you think? We let them. We have plenty of fuel. That's it. Now what? We wait. My peers in the profession informed me that it would not be possible, to breed animals to become more aggressive. They ostracized me and called me irresponsible, too mad, they banished me from their lofty halls of learning, with a sign around my neck. They have no idea what radical is, radical is their way of drawing a line between themselves and what they cannot comprehend. They have no concept of the courage it takes to tap into the primal fear of another living creature and turn it into turn it into They're going up. one single purpose to survive at all costs. No bother social order. No bothered thousands of needless minutia that surround our lives no wives, children, family, friends worrying about what bills to pay, what cologne to wear, what automobile to be seen in. Imagine the pureness of that living with one true purpose. One sole reason to be Imagine living with no fear, out here I must admit there is a temptation to play part. We are making the animals harder to hunt all right, but who am I kidding? They're going to think I've lost it. They're going to think I'm the lunatic out to vindicate himself Hey, I remember me? I sure as hell remember you, you son of a bitch. Finish it. Run Davis, what are you doing? He's giving us a chance. Come on. There it is. It's Davis Are you crazy? We got to go. No. Davis! Oh god, Davis. Come on We made it, thank god. See you in a minute Doc.
