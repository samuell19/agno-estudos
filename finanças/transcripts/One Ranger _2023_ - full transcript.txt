Hound got your scent back at the ranch. Shit, I smelled you from miles away. Who am I supposed to have pissed off anyhow? Hey, you done violated the conditions of your parole. (Tom] Like hell I did. Assault, brandishing a firearm in a public place. You stole a horse, rifle, whiskey from your employer. You want me to go on? That's my rifle. What business do you have with a 10,000-dollar plains rifle, Tom? Oh, saddle up son. You're done. Try to run, I'll kill ya. Hunting to feed my family, Ranger. Too bad it ain't hunting season.

What can I do for you, Elmer? 10-65, old Mutual Bank over here in Mount Verde got themselves held up about a half hour ago. Four heavily armed gunmen driving one of them off-road type rigs came in raising all manners of hell. Got a 10-99 code on it. Killed three officers. Even put old Ben Copper's boy in the ER, so figured they'd be heading your direction there, Alex. Watch your six, buddy.

Let's go! 10-24, we lost 'em. They're heading southbound on Terlingua. Shit. (engine rumbling] (dispatch] 10-22 has broken pursuit. Suspects were last seen headed southbound on Terlingua Street. One suspect has left the vehicle. We are going to engage. "And there before me was a white horse. Its rider was named Death - and Hell... - (gun cocks] - So close behind Devil." - Shit! Gun! Get out now! (dispatch] 10-22, this is 10-24. Come in. Are you engaging the suspects? Shane, if you're there, answer me. (engine revving] (Alex] They'll make the border before the state police have a chopper off the ground. Yeah, wish I was with them. Creaky bastard like you creeping up on a full-blood Tonkawa. - Spot me. - (radio static] (Daniels] Mexican police ain't got a unit close enough to intercede. These boys should be considered extremely dangerous there, partner. Proceed with caution now, Tyree. (radio static] Hah. You gonna shoot out their tires? It's half a mile away, Ranger. You're a good shot, but that's impossible. (bullet cracking] That's six feet high. Jesus, Alex. (bullet cracking] (Tom] Goddamn! That's some shooting there, Ranger. - (tire hissing] - What happened? What the fuck happened? (driver speaking Spanish] (driver speaking Spanish] Shattered the block and killed the engine.

Radio call said there were four men, Ranger. You gonna go after the other guy? Yeah, that other one won't get far on his own. Now you'll be letting me go, huh, Ranger? You going to jail, Tom. ("I Don't Feel At Home" by Mat Hagar playing] (dogs barking distantly] - (groans] - (can clinks] (door handle clicks] - (grunts] - (thuds] I did suggest he knock first. He was concerned since you weren't answering your phone. That man is Special Agent Derby of the FBI. British Intelligence. I take it you're Ranger Alex Tyree? Major Edwards said we could find you here. We'd like to come in for a chat, if that's okay. You all right? Give me two minutes. British Intelligence? We're here with the approval of your State Department. Special agent Derby was tasked with making sure I didn't get into trouble. Well, he's lucky I didn't shoot him through the door. You have a lot of enemies, Ranger? (sighs] I put people in jail. They tend to take offense to that. I realize you have a different way of handling things here, Ranger. And it can be quite difficult to grasp from a desk in London, but... we're very aware of the elite investigative skills of the Texas Rangers, and we know what you do works. We're not some cowboy operation, Agent Smith. We go by the book, just like they do in London. I'm here because Major Edwards said you're the best ranger he's ever seen, so I've been sent to ask you to go into Mexico and collect a prisoner. Federales won't allow an official British or US extraction, but unofficially, they've asked for you. You'll be there as a private citizen. If anything goes wrong, our association will be basically deniable in every conceivable way. It's been nice meeting you, Agent Smith. Excuse me? You got the wrong moron, lady. Crossed the border myself. Federales laughed in my face when I told them I was there to extradite a prisoner. (laughs] I'm late for work. Carmen here will see you out. The prisoner in question is the bank robber who killed the three deputies in Esperanza County. What is he to you? His name is Declan McBride. Ex-provisional IRA wanted for a string of terrorist activities on and off the British mainland. He's extremely vicious and very resourceful. And if we don't move quick, he will find a way to negotiate himself out prison. And what's an Irishman doing robbing banks in Texas? Well, he's gone rogue, charging a small fee to rob banks and passing the proceeds to the worst criminal causes imaginable. Through his old partner, we found out he's planning a job on the British mainland. I'm asking you to do this on behalf of my country. (tense music playing] The English agents insulted my intelligence by attempting to threaten me, Alex. I was tempted not to give him an extradition at all, but then I thought of you. I remembered you helped me with a situation that was very delicate. That small act had large consequences. It made me indebted to you. Today I pay you back. The simple extradition will be now a deportation, and the paperwork is already filled out. Right. (speaking Spanish] (McBride] Thanks for the hospitality. Mexico's a lovely place. - You're welcome. - (car door slams] (indistinct radio chatter] (McBride] I can make it worth your while if you drop me off here. Save your breath, partner. (McBride] I'm sorry about the police officers. Genuinely am, but I acted in the cause of a greater good. How much more of this is off-road? Less than ten miles, we'll be at the border cross. Twenty minutes from there we'll be in Nuevo Laredo. You know who led the first successful revolution against colonial empire? Huh? George fucking Washington. See, justice is just your perspective, Ranger. Elements working here are far bigger than the two of us. You talk more than my ex-wife. (McBride] Shame of it is, Ranger, I think I'd have liked going up against you. (engine revving] (henchmen speaking Spanish] (Daniels groans] (gunfire continues] (henchman grunting] (both grunting] (both grunting] (gunfire continues] (groans] Good to see you again, boss. No injuries? Only my pride, brother. I told you, the bank robbery was a bad idea. (McBride] Next time I'll listen. Go get that cop. - (siren wailing] - That's our cue, Oleg. He's seen your face. Choose your battles. (engine revving] (siren wailing] (indistinct chatter] (tense music playing] Two faces that warm the heart with memories of conflict past. We have walked through the dark as friends. Which is better than to walk through the light alone. Yuri. Declan. You will stay. I have food and Ukrainian vodka. My men are peasants but they raid well. Come. (speaking Russian] We will toast to comrades lost. It is unwise to refuse the generosity of Cossack, lest they change their minds. Appreciate the invitation. We're on the job (indistinct], brother. So it is business. - Mm-hmm. - (speaking Russian] (Yuri] So, gentlemen, Cold War 155-millimeter-long gun. It will fire 100-pound projectile 14 miles on good day. And on a bad day? On bad day, it will be the nightmare that ends your life before you hear the sound. Have your men deliver to this address. I'll take it from there. (sighs] You know, I worry that you will upset many people with this toy. I like you, Declan. You are like brother. But when this job is over, then so are we. (indistinct chattering] I expected you to look worse. You got a lot of nerve, lady. You've every right to be indignant. You were ambushed, likely set up, but you did your job, and thank God you're still alive. Thank God I'm alive. Ranger Daniels was a good man. He was a husband, father, and a damn fine lawman. He was also my friend. I'm sorry. Sorry? That ain't gonna cut it. But work with me, Tyree. Help me bring in McBride. You've seen him close-up, talked to him. You know him better than anyone else we have. I doubt that. You knew they were gonna try to spring him, didn't you? Need to get yourself another errand boy, lady. If I go after McBride, it's gonna be under my terms, with my men, and my rules. Just sit down, please. Ranger Tyree, please. You got one good reason why I should help you? You want a reason, I'll give you multiple reasons. The 1993 killings of US servicemen in Somalia. The '98 bombings of US embassies. The kidnapping of 16 Western tourists in Yemen - that same year. - Yemen? All executed and planned by a man named Aden Kashmiri. Now, we believe Kashmiri has retained McBride's services for a substantial fee to cause or instigate a terrorist event in London. McBride working for Kashmiri makes him the world's most dangerous terrorist for hire. Keep talking. Help me track him down. Do what you do. Uh, the department would have to sign off on it, and nothing really gels around here that efficiently, so... You've already talked to the major, haven't ya? Right. (plane humming] You remind me of my dad. He was a police detective in London. We're in the East End. It used to be a rough area. He was killed on the job when I was 17. (sighs] Mm. Sorry to hear that. It was then and there I decided to go into law enforcement. Ah. Switched college courses to criminal science, was recruited straight out of college by MI6. You did all right. He'd approve. Don't underestimate McBride, Ranger. Declan is a sociopathic murderer with a genius IQ. Misjudged him once. (sighs] Won't happen again. I believe that. I should ask. Do you plan on even remotely trying to blend in? (sighs] I guess I could lose the hat in London. Section Control Geddes. Call me Chief Control or just Geddes. We're informal here. - Who's "we"? - The agency. We who ensure the security of the entire island nation of Great Britain and it's Commonwealth. Glad you can join us. Alex Tyree. Nice hat, very subtle. I'll order you one. If you had to give a threat assessment number out of ten, in your opinion, where would Declan McBride sit? I don't rate 'em. Just catch 'em and brand 'em. Mm. You actually talk like that. This asshole got away from me once. I'll drop the boom on him next time. You've been closer to him than any living operative, you've spoken to him and survived. That makes you a temporary asset, Ranger. McBride is in London, and it's our responsibility to see to it that he doesn't leave. Is that clear? Yeah, I get your drift, chief. If you do something, anything that reflects poorly on the agency, asset status terminated. You're on your own, son. Am I crystal fucking clear? I'm not your son. And I'm not your fucking daddy. Just answer the question, cowboy. We understand, Control. Thank you for accommodating us. And we will do everything in our power to respect the agency's wishes and the discreet nature of our position. There'll be a detective in the lobby, 7:30 a.m. He's your liaison. You are not permitted to move around the city without him. That five-peso star affords you no more rights than any other guest to this city. Agent Smith, you're in the UK now. Protocol is everything. Yes, Control. Okay. Seven and three-eighths. My hat size. (moaning] (McBride panting] (Angel] Yeah? Who said you could stop? You owe me more than that, you lazy cunt. Always a sweet talker. (both panting] You shouldn't have left me. You got what shouldn't be gotten. I need your help, Angel. I know. Knew it when I saw you. Knew it when you made love. Know it's the only reason you're here now. (breathes heavily] Angel... - (lighter flicks] - Angel... Kid outside worships me. I give him kale and he'll slice you into dozen pieces and throw you in the Thames. Shouldn't have done what you did to me. Swore if I ever saw you again, I'd fuck you back. So this is it? You turned on too many old friends, me included. Now you can leave. (receptionist] Alex Tyree, you're in room 207. Elevator's to the left. - Thank you. - Wanna walk off the cab ride? As opposed to a massage? Luke will take any luggage for you. (sighs, grunts] Thank you, Luke. With pleasure, sir. Throw it on the bed. You call this April? Should've listened to Carmen and wore a warmer jacket. So you staying at the hotel? Well, I lived in Langley for three years. I don't keep a place in the UK anymore. Stranger in your own town, huh? Geddes wants us to work with his babysitter but they won't be here till morning. This ain't a walk for our health, is it? It's a long shot. There's a potential intelligence source. - Taxi. - Ah. (Smith] Her name's Angel, ex-IRA, and she's got a real axe to grind when it comes to McBride. (Alex] Let's hope she feels like talking.

Or is looking at your reflection caused you to, you know, empty the bar already? You brought your girlfriend here. Part of the States you're from, yeah? Texas, ma'am. Great state of Texas. Well, you may want to invest in some local wardrobe. You stand out like a baller in sweatpants. I know what yous want, Smith. Hmm. Bad news travels fast. Get outta here. Give us some privacy, you fucking apes. I'm trying to have a private conversation. (door closes] (lighter clicks] Don't screw me around, Angel. You know me better than that. Sit down. Sit down. He's here in town, for sure. You're not gonna find him without my help. Why should I believe anything you have to say about him? You're hardly a disinterested party. I know what you're implying, but anything between McBride and me died when he took my fucking eye. Hmm. 'Cause I heard he saved your life after the attack where you lost your eye. You heard fucking wrong. You expect me to believe that any animosity you have for McBride is motivation enough to sully your reputation? - I want money. - Ah. Cash money. Man's fucking dangerous. So in addition, I'll be wanting three men released. Not parole, but released. These lads need a clean record to get their year citizenship. So much harder since 9/11. You can appreciate that, don't you, Ranger? You don't have anything. (Alex] I can negotiate a visa entry. And arrange for leniency, customs and immigrations in extenuating circumstances, you see. You have my word on it. (Angel] You'll find McBride when you find Oleg. Checked in two days ago. Room 27. (Alex] Right. Jesus. (cars honking] You sure take me to the nicest places, Smith. Just make sure you stay behind me. Ahh. McBride finds out I'm in town, he'll go Casper on us, which gives us hours not days. And time is of the essence. (lock clinking] What is that? They told me to leave my .45 at home. You are just an observer here, Tyree. Study shows it's a lot more dangerous when law enforcement are armed. Weren't dangerous, wouldn't need one.

Tragic that you let him slip away. If Jakovenko is in London, then McBride's nearby. Give me access to the data, let me find him, Control. An arresting officer has already gone on record saying that someone in a cowboy hat fired shots at a fleeing suspect in a crowded area. Even allowing for certain quaint West Texas customs, uh, wouldn't you agree that that was quite reckless? (sighs] Last time I saw him, he murdered my friend and partner, chief. You don't forget a man does that to you. Give me something that I can take to the agency executive. Parliamentary council is breathing down their necks. Nobody enjoys parrying questions from Etonians with no concept of field intelligence. They're actually already talking about a possible scapegoat. Any reason I shouldn't give them one? Ranger Tyree is the only asset that's seen Declan McBride in person. We're British Intelligence. We have considerable assets, don't we? Use them. Convince me that you are the right team for this assignment. I need concrete evidence that McBride is operating on British soil. Ad colligenda bona. Thanks, boss. And I will also need a written report, Ranger Tyree, about yesterday's action. I wasn't sure what I thought of you, chief. I'm just a simple operative like you. Perhaps.

The Easter Monday uprising against the British, April 24th, 1916. Ancient clock. Big Ben near Houses of Parliament. He's gonna launch a dirty bomb. Not bad. But you got there 'cause of my comment about Michael Collins, didn't you? Really? (McBride] In 1954, French forces suffered a defeat so definitive that they withdrew all colonial forces and quit the conflict in Indochina. To surprise the French, Viet men had attacked from mountains overlooking the French positions, dismantling their artillery and carried on bicycles on women's backs up into the mountain. In front of me, Mr. Kashmiri, is a 152-millimeter Howitzer smuggled into the country piece by piece. Reassembled and aimed directly at the House of Parliament. You have performed your task remarkably, Brother McBride. Now I must ask you to step away. Step away? This is the single greatest terrorist plot since 9/11 and you're asking me to stand down before the command performance? The threat is greater than the act. Until it is proved that we can do what we promise, we can negotiate our demands. Demands? You're just another fucking politician. I am Aden Kashmiri! Your spiritual leader! You will do as I command and stand down, McBride. Stand down! The blood of the prophet runs in me. Don't do it! (exhales heavily] (growling] I thought you'd quit. Killed Protestants in the name of the Catholic faith. Buddhists in the name of China. Hindus in the name of Buddha. I killed Christians in the name of Islam, and now they ask me to stop. Bloody religions. To hell, them all. I'll drink to that. The ranger will be coming. Time to finish old business. Let's go. Chopper unit with FLIR discovered an off-the-charts radium deposit. Requires at least 50 pounds of isotope to give off a reading that intense. Thanks, sir. I served in Kyrgyzstan and Syria, Ranger. You don't see it. You don't smell it. You don't hear it. It kills absolutely and without warning. I am not sending my men in there. - But I need to go in. - Well, you can do as you wish, but you're gonna have to wait until the area's evacuated. Evacuated? I ordered a two-mile radius evacuated, and when it is, I'm hitting that building with a JDAM explosive missile. I need time. We need this guy alive. He's our only link to Aden Kashmiri. A JDAM missile will take out the entire block. Give me two rocket launchers on the building across the street, and wait for my order. (lieutenant over radio] I can give you 30 minutes, Smith, and then we're hitting the building whether you're out or not. Am I clear? (Smith] We need to be careful. We don't want McBride triggering this thing. (Alex] We'll catch him like a rabbit. Cage will be on him before he knows what hit him. I'll take care of this guy. I'll go upstairs, I'll wait for you. (grunting] Security building's been breached. By a tall piece of piss wearing a ten-gallon hat. Oleg will take care of it. Move out. (Oleg] Ranger. We're getting old, and the men we break in are just getting younger. I drink vodka in the morning to ease the pain of a long life. (lieutenant] Is that machine gun fire I'm hearing, Smith? I need more time, lieutenant, you gotta give me something. You have 25 minutes left. (grunts, thuds] Modern ammunition wait for no man, Ranger. We never finished our dance. This is ridiculous. Look at us. Maybe. But you took my eye. Each time we meet, you get the worst of it. (Oleg laughs] Beginner's luck. Ha. Three times? Throw in the towel, son. Maybe I got hit in the head too many times, Ranger. But to get to him, you must go through me. (both grunting] (grunting continues] ♪ (Oleg groaning] ♪ (grunting continues] Stay down, Oleg. Not possible. It don't need to be like this. - (grunting] - (blood splatters] (panting] (Smith] Fuck. What the fuck? You look like you've been hit by a truck. - I'm just an observer, Smith. - Only that was like - the fourth fucking time. - (breathing heavily] Just need to catch my breath. Okay, I mean, take a minute, - but we kind of need to go. - (exhales] I'm good to go. You sure? - Good to go. - Okay, take this gun. - (exhales] - We've got 20 minutes. McBride is dug in on the seventh floor. (exhales] Right. The raw isotope has now impregnated the explosive. RDD is ready for the final mission, sir. (McBride sighs] I don't expect allegiance from any of you when the job's done. I'll understand if you and your men want to cut out. We've spoken about it, and we stand by you. No one else fucking has. Not women, family, even friends. Yous the only ones that have. Well, then, Let's get to it, shall we? (tense music playing] (indistinct radio chatter] All 11 targets painted, ma'am. Ready to engage at your command. You're a hundred percent sure you can neutralize the threat? They have not armed the uranium device. We can hit them now, but the window closes if they arm it. We are on the sixth floor, so just keep that fire localized. You may wanna brace for this, Ranger. Smith, you need to move. Move now. We have two 84-millimeter rocket launchers ready to fire. Fuck! Engage the enemy, gentlemen. (officer] Fire! (rockets blasting] (men yelling] (sirens wailing] (grunts] Hit it. Hold your fucking fire. I'm coming out. I'm coming out. - I'm throwing my gun. - (gun thudding] - We've got him. - (radio static] Declan McBride, you're not an easy man to find. Why don't you show me them hands, son? Here's two I prepared earlier. Shoot me. We'll salute St. Michael together. Get on your fucking knees now. Careful, Ranger. Put the gun down. You may be suicidal. Her? Not so sure. No matter how far I have to track you, whatever it takes, I guarantee I will not quit until you're behind bars or six feet under. - Well, then... - (clinks] Good luck to you, Ranger. (grenades thud] I repeat, he's on the run. ♪ (lieutenant] Lost sight of McBride, Smith. Repeat. We do not have eyes on the target. McBride is Charlie Foxtrot. (Geddes] Orwell said that people sleep peaceably in their beds at night because rough men, and in our case, rough women, stand ready to do violence on their behalf. The world owes you both a great debt of appreciation, and I want to thank you on behalf of the agency. Agent Smith, you'll return to your unit. Ranger Tyree, I assume you'll be leaving us at your earliest convenience. Well, I am, and I will. Happy trails. I'll be checking my mail. Seven and three-eighths cattleman. You want boots to go with it? Just the hat, Ranger. You're not going home, are you, Ranger? Ah, things... ain't that simple. We're done. Good guys won. Got your payback. When Ranger Daniels graduated from the academy, married his high school sweetheart. At their wedding, I promised her I'd look out for him. That promise ended in the dirt, side of the road in Laredo County, so... I've got to make good on that. You're going after him? Don't reckon I have a choice. ♪ (Smith] The DEA drone over Sinaloa, Mexico spotted what they think is a smuggling outfit led by McBride. They have me deep in another project, or I would be there with you. I'll send you all the information we have. Good luck, Alex. ♪ (grunts] Ranger Tyree. You come all the way down here for me? It's the law of the jungle out here. You ready to commit to that, Ranger? Get your boots on. (groans] (gangsters speaking Spanish] You gonna kill all of us? Well, I'd prefer not to. - You're all on your lonesome. - (sighs] I asked you to get your boots on. Don't make me repeat myself. (sighs] Fine. (speaking Spanish] That was foolish.

There's two types in this game, McBride. Those on the run, and those doing the hunting. Dead or alive. Your choice. I thought so. Tie something around that leg. Use it as a tourniquet. It's a long walk. You got this covered, Ranger? (Alex] Chief. You're gonna find a mess of deceased smugglers back yonder. Once again, I'm indebted to you. Many people will not think it so. I believe a man should always celebrate a job well done. Ciggaro? I like your line of reasoning, chief. - All right. (sighs] - (lighter clicks] It might be a better arrangement to have the Irishman buried with his mules. You know, I'm right here, chief. Might just come to that, Ignacio. I might suggest to stay clear out of Mexico for a... a decade or so. (laughs] (grunting] (chief] Adios, Ranger! (McBride] And that's all it took to take me down? One riot, and one fucking ranger.
