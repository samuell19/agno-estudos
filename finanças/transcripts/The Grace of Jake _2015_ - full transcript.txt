I begged her. Hell I even drove out to LA lookin' for her. For both of you. She made it clear she was done with me. Once you made it clear you were done with her. I was 19 Jake. Not usin' that as an excuse, just a point of reference. What were you doin' when you were 19? Heroin, a lot of it. She's a strong headed woman. She gets her heart set on somethin' and she won't let go. She's dead. I was in the joint when she died. They let me go to her funeral. Had to wear cuffs though. She was alone? Pretty much. How could you do that to her? How could you? How long were you in prison? Which time? Why don't you just go ahead and shoot me? I still might.

Then Jesus answered, 'I tell you not seven times but seventy seven times.'" Well, Lawd. The Gospel according to Luke Chapter 17 Verse 3. "If your brother sins, rebuke him. If he repents forgive him. If he sins against you, seven times in a day, and seven times he comes back to you and he repents, forgive him." Amen! Yes. Lord. It ain't easy to let things go ain't it? Amen.

It was just an innocent little kiss Booster, really. - Umm, Umm I'm sorry. - I don't mean to pry, But would you mind not doing this here, this is a respectable place of business. Okay, just, make it quick. She knew who she wanted to be with just as soon as it happened. Just a kiss? That's all it was. Well two really, you kissed me back. On the cheek! Don't yell at her. It didn't mean anything. Alright, kiss him. Do what? Kiss him, if it ain't all that. I don't see the relevance. It's just a damn kiss. What in the hell? What you done back there, I seen that. Just ain't right. Goes against everything in the bible. When did you ever read the bible, Alvah? Church camp, when I was eleven.
