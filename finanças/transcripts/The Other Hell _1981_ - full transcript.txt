Sister Assunta. Sister. Where are you? Oh, Mother I'm lost in this labyrinth. Sister Assunta! Sister Assunta! Who is it? Who's there? Moving this nobody's there, answer me. Who is it? Sister Assunta! Is that you Sister Assunta? Who is it? Sister where are you? Sister Assunta? Are you in here? Are you in here, Sister? What do you want? Go on answer. I lost my way in the corridors... and I had the feeling I was being followed by somebody. May I know why Sister Assunta is not here? You gave orders for her to remain in her cell. The first thing to do in embalming. A sinful nun is to... cleanse her of evil starting here! That's the place. The evil starts there between her legs. The evil which grows and consumes everything even the spirit... the devil enters a woman there and devours her. The genitals are the door to evil, the vagina, the uterus... the womb, the labyrinth that leads to hell. The devil's tools. Hell is within us. Mother of God, protect. Can you guess why this poor nun... is lying here cold and dead? No. Her weakness was her down fall, it made her a prey to... temptation I warned her and she didn't listen... she kept on sinning until in the end... she was his, the devil incarnate. The stomach swelled inside her, she kept a monster... it had black body hair and satanic eyes. An evil creature born dead on the sabbath. An abortion? Yes, an abortion, the evils being is destroyed. Cut from the womb, removed from this Holy place. But, the threat lives on here in the convent... the demon lives and feeds on good... suckling at the breasts of nuns like this one here. Sister Florence! Our Mother superior... embalmed and destined to stay a sinner through eternity. The spirit acquired prisoner... of this convent because she killed herself they tell you. You can hear her calling... calling out some nights. She's put a curse on us, she calls... and the name she calls is the nun who killed her! Sister, Sister Assunta, what is it? What's wrong? I can't do anything. What's watching you Sister? Sister! What happened? An accident, an accident Mother, an awful accident. One day Christ will come down from the cross... and then the profaners of the temple will be punished... and you will be among them Sister Assunta. It was merely an unfortunate accident... that caused the deaths of Sister Assunta... and Sister Christina and the arrival... of Padre lnardo is purely a formality. Reply to any questions he may ask. Ancl in no time at all life will return to normal. Now before we begin dinner let's pray... for the spirits of our dear departed Sisters. Welcome Padre. You must let me talk. No, you must let me talk, let me talk. Sister Rosaria please not here. Let her talk if she wants to. Now what is it? If you have anything to say speak up, why don't you? Go on speak. Padre you've come here to this convent to banish... the demons that beset us and save our souls from evil. The devil is with us, he is here... he's all around us, you must leave for your own good... it's too late he possesses us all. Stop it! You must control yourself... put her away she's out of her head. Take her to her cellar at once. Let me go, let me go, listen to me Father... the devil is no longer in hell he lives in heaven... and we have to worship him, he's in heaven! The parable. Of the man possessed. I can't. I can't. Help me, help. Please. Sister what is it, what is it Sister, come on inside. Come on inside and lie down. Come inside. Protect her soul. Protect her spirit safe from damnation. She has sinned so protect and forgive her. In the name of the most Holy trinity. I exorcize you, vile satanic thing of ugliness and fire. In the name of our Lord who's eternal love will protect us all... from the powers of darkness and destruction. All malevolent forces surrender this Holy place into... the hands of those who love and worship the one true God. Let the holiness of our Lord Jesus Christ... shed light on the shadows that darken this place... once dedicated to the purity of the spirit. The spirits of evil I order you... in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost to leave this place and allow it to regain peace... and tranquility once enjoyed by... these humble God loving Sisters. May your love and forgiveness grace once more. No, not in there. Why not? There's nothing up there... just the attic the convent goes no further. I want to finish the blessing of the whole building... even the attic has to be reconsecrated. No! That sounded like Sister Rosaria! Where is Mother Vincenza? Who has the key? Hurry, somebody fetch the key! What can have happened here? She's dead Padre. She's no longer with us. Father would you mind, come with me. Please Father. Now don't misunderstand me Father... I have the highest regard for the way you work more than... once your methods have proved exceedingly successful. In this case was particularly difficult... But two deaths in the same convent... followed by the extraordinary demise of Sister Rosaria... is too much of a coincidence. I cannot believe this is what you say it is. Father, this is the 20th century... and the church must renew it's methods of exorcism. Anyone who does not believe in the devil... cannot believe in God. You're right. Where there's good there's evil. The devil exists alright but he exists in the hearts... and minds of human beings not underground... or in the heavens, only here, in the dark recesses... of the subconscious. Father Valerio will be taking over your work Father... at the convent. It may seem unorthodox but I believe that the intricate... labyrinths of the human psyche needs an explorer... who can put his mind to work on the psychology of mysticism... investigate the religious mind, it's inspirations... and motivations which often stem from early experiences. What we used to call Satan is no more than the negative... thought that accompanies the positive. In this century science has progressed enormously... if the church is to retain its following it must remain... a breast of that progress. Father Valerio is a special investigator... a man after my own heart... a kind of ecclesiastical detective. I'm quite certain he's capable of finding out the cause of the disturbances at the convent and putting them to rights. You are very young Father Valerio... and obviously an enthusiastic lad. However consider this... there are moments in our work when science, technology... psychology, logic if you like, are not enough... in those moments we find ourselves face to face... with the evil one, his unbelievable strength that crushes... everything with its fury and there is only one weapon... with which to combat it, one weapon, the only one... you can ever win with. True faith. Ludwig! Down! He might kill you, these dogs are dangerous you know. Thank you. Are you hungry around this time of clay? I should have been more careful. I was trying to find the way into the convent... didn't have much luck. The main gates over there... quarter of a mile down the road. Thanks for calling the dog off. I guess you're Boris. You look after the garden at the convent. I was expecting you. A priest was coming here they said... that looked more like a cop. They told me you'd be asking a lot of questions... and poking into everyone's business. I don't like that, snooping and spying on us. I really prefer to live here with the animals... I don't trust human beings, they cause trouble. Animals don't talk. I give them their food and they make sure I'm not hungry. I've fed this little hen for months... so you see now it's her turn! The evil is getting burned... and the force disappears with it. Fingerprints tend to disappear in the ashes too. The one thing I insist on Sister is to be allowed... to work without interference. I must feel that I can come to my own conclusions... without outside influence. Now I looked at this report by Padre lnardo... and there are many unexplained things. Sister Rosaria, Sister Assunta... they appear to have committed suicide... but it's odd that the Mother Superior... did the same thing years ago. And the manner in which they died has a great similarity. Do you intend to investigate this? Yes I do and if necessary question the nuns individually. I won't allow you to upset the convent life... the nuns are still extremely shocked. Mother, I was sent here specially to try to find out... how these women died, it was a job I was given... and I don't mean to leave this convent... until I've solved the mystery. Well there's no mystery in this convent... I assure you! It's all quite clear. The power of evil has been unleashed in this convent... and it's making off with our weaker souls one by one. Those who's belief is thin. You won't help my nuns by digging into their private lives Padre. The best way to fight the devil is with the weapons... given us by our Lord and you ought to know what they are. The greatest weapon our Lord gave us was a brain... and that's just what I'm gonna use to win this battle. Don't you see? Those nuns were murdered. This is the work of human beings not Satan. Goodnight Reverend Mother. Stop it! Quieten down do ya hear? Get down at once. Who's that wandering round out there? Quiet, come this way. I've got a welcome ready for you. Come on then. Oh eternal God, Lord of earthly and unearthly things... you have created all things of the love of man... whom you made in your image. Look down on me in your infinite mercy... and guide this humble servant of your will. The thing that unites them all is silence... and my presence here is suspicious to them. They change direction when they see me coming... and barely answer me when I wish them good morning. This hostility stems from their guiding light... the Mother Superior, Sister Vincenza. Her enigmatic face seems to be everywhere, watching me. Sister Vincenza wields enormous power over the nuns... in this convent, she dominates them with a kind of... supernatural force. Who's there? The devil. Father, Father. I'm waiting for you. Come down to the chapel, I want to confess. Amen. I'll hear your confession now. You've nothing to fear from me... all your secrets however intimate or hidden from the world... will be kept forever. I know I can trust you... but I don't know how to tell you. I love you but I'm afraid. Afraid? Yes. I'm afraid you might refuse me... and I could not bear such a fate. Leave this confessional at once I want to see you. No please Padre, please not yet. What do you mean not yet? She'll hate you, she's out there... she's the one who hates you be careful. I don't understand. Who's out there? Padre, I want to confess. And I want an explanation. Be careful Padre, she wants to kill you. Padre, I'm about to commit the worst sin of all... help me Padre come closer, closer. Unfortunately this is not the first time our humble chapel... has been the scene of unjust and horrifying incidents. There have been many pitiful cases... of which this is perhaps the saddest of all. Father come in, see for yourself. She's been like this ever since she got lost in the... catacomb under the convent. We've done everything to try to bring her... to her senses without success. She never speaks and appears to hear nothing. She simply vegetates. More like a plant than a human being. Look, the tabernacle. Look. Oh God why must this ghastly sacrilege continue unchecked? Is there no way of ending it? There must be a reason for all this horror. If we could only find a motive for killing all these poor nuns... but I cannot see why anyone... would want to do such a thing. What if Father lnardo was right? It looks as if we're face to face... with a supernatural phenomenon. What other explanation is there for these awful murders... other than devil's work? It's the work of a sick mind. You can call it diabolical but it's not. Someone must want to hide a secret... someone who'd stoop to murder to avoid revealing it. Grant me a few more days Your Eminence... and I'll try to break this case open. I hope sincerely you succeed... otherwise I'm afraid I shall be forced to close the convent... and call in the police, something I'd prefer not to do. I shall have to change my tactics... with the Sisters at the convent. I've avoided treating them harshly til now. Help, help, help, help me Sisters... he's gone crazy! Holy Virgin Father Valerio's possessed of the devil... have mercy on our souls! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost... help, help, help. You're crazy, crazy! I'll tell them, I'll tell everything. You'll tell them nothing. You won't say a word. You're a beast, the only thing you can do... is impregnate women like all men... that's the only thing you can do. You're a poison creature. I'm going to free your soul from your revolting body. No! Then you'll never behave like... Reverend Mother, Reverend Mother! What is it? Father Valerio is turning our cells upside down, please hurry! I'll come at once. Come on sister, out of here if you don't mind. But I was praying. Well do it later. Padre Valeri0's gone crazy! He burst into my cell like an enraged bull I was praying... and he threw me out the door "do it later" he says. Oh Mother. You! How dare you have the nerve to come in here! I shall complain to the Bishop and have you sent away today! I'm only trying to find some kind of clue... and I'm prepared to turn this convent upside down... until I find what I'm looking for do you hear? I will not permit you too. Yes you will Reverend Mother. Save your dictatorial methods for your unfortunate nuns... I'm outside your jurisdiction. This is necessary, I'm sorry to intrude. Here eat that. Come 'ere, come on. Here's your meat. Don't you want your supper? Go on eat. You. Get her, go on, sic him! Right, get back now. Good, you've been very good. Done a good job and you deserve something special... a surprise, here this is for you. An extremely childish drawing, naive really... but I think I'm right. It might be the key that will open everything. I believe the answer lies here in this picture. An event that occurred here many years ago in this convent. I won't let you take her from me. My daughter belongs to me. I want her. That creatures the child of Satan... the fruit of sin and obscenity... and you dare to say you want to keep the monstrous thing. I'm sorry Reverend Mother I'll do anything you ask... only let me take her and forgive me for loving her... she's my child, I made her, she's a part of me. A nun must not admit to a thing like that. You're profaning the temple. You should destroy it... and if you don't I will! No! No my child! No! No! My child! On my child! Padre. I beg you not to take it. I won't allow anybody to have her. They tell me she's a monster... and it's just because she's been ill treated. She's a baby, my sweet baby. Little Elisa, my little Elisa. I never thought she was a monster. She's gifted with extrasensory perception and power. She can translate her thoughts into. The devil and I made her... he and I together, we made a pact. I'd have her, my own daughter... and I'd renounce the vows of a nun... taking up the life of the devil's woman. Allowing him to penetrate me and give me his child. He would creep into my bed after dark... and I reveled in his lust. I felt the joy inside like this! Joy and pain do you feel it? The pain of penetration and birth. All you can produce are empty screams... but I produced a child, a wonderful child. She can even preform miracles... and make things move on their own... and bring back the dead, the dead! She could kill if she wanted too... but she won't, she loves a man see? Only she's mine all mine! No man will take her from me. I love you, oh I love you... but you must never see my face. I never want you to look at me. I want to see you Elisa. Why do you hide? No. I don't hate anyone, they made me do things. She's cruel, she hates everyone. She won't let me love you. Because I'm the daughter of Satan. No! You'll never have her! She's my child, I'm gonna keep her! My child! No! Mother. I don't believe it! No! She's in there, Satan's daughter. She's trying to destroy us. You must stop her, she wants to destroy us all. Mama. No! No! Don't get any closer go away! Mama. No! Mama. Where are you? Mama. Mama come back. Don't leave me. Mama. Mama I'm clying and I'll leave you soon now. You gave me life and you gave me death. I didn't mean to. Not really. But you hurt me, you killed me. I didn't mean to. That man did, it was his fault. No! No! No! No! No! No! My daughter please have mercy on your poor mother Elisa. Did you have mercy on me? Try to understand, you came from my body, I'm your mother... don't hate me, you're mine. Elisa... You belong to me! For treaties and black magic. The entire technique of dissection carefully laid down... in preparation for the embalming process. In almost cauldrons and coffins. Ex morte vita. That is beyond death life continues. And all this went on here in the bowels of the earth. The perfect laboratory of a devilish alchemist. A coven of witches. This is the devil's door. No, Reverend Mother no... I wouldn't call this the devil's door it merely... the pitifully obvious invention of a very unfortunate soul. A demented mind that was created entirely out of guilt... for having feelings a nun must deny. Her remorse at giving birth. What happened to, I believe his name was Padre Valerio? I've heard that he isn't... Yes, he went completely crazy... and that's the part I find so hard to understand... I knew the man well, like my own brother... we studied theology together and I find it impossible... to believe he can no longer communicate except through telekinesis... rambling on about the risen dead and demons. I think the truth of the matter is that he suffered a cerebral trauma... when he was stabbed by poor Sister Vincenza. Who knows if he'll ever... When is the convent due to be blessed by the Bishop? Today, I think. And same as in ancient times the Holy water will cleanse... the place of evil. Oh, Padre is it an earthquake? What's going on? I am afraid. Don't worry I can explain it. I'm sure it's just a minor tremor that's all. There's a logical explanation for everything.
