- North Seattle High… …it's pep rally time. -So let's get loud, Bulldogs! HARVARD UNIVERSITY MY APPLICATION Mandy Yang Pending The prom committee's also going to announce this year's prom theme. Oh, yeah! BULLDOGS Prom PACT It's about to get crunk! Now, give it up for the pride of North Seattle High, your championship team, Bulldogs! We are the Bulldogs, and we're here to fight! - Bulldogs unite! - I love it! Go, fight, win! There's Graham. There he goes! DONATIONS FOR THE UNHOUSED LOST & FOUND Bulldogs! Come on, everybody! Bulldogs! Bulldogs! Mandy Yang, what are you doing? We've been over this. You cannot skip pep rallies to steal from the lost and found. Ms. Chen, I'm not stealing. I'm donating. - All right. All right, fine. - For the win! Give it up! I hope you're happy. I'm a high school guidance counselor. I'm never happy. You're not gonna actually make me sit through that thing? I am. Oh, look at that. I guess I am happy sometimes. Fine. - Have fun! Go, Bulldogs. Go, go, go. Go, Bulldogs. Go, Bulldogs, go! Go, Bulldogs. Go, go, go. Go, Bulldogs. Go, Bulldogs, go. Go, Bulldogs. Go, go, go. BOOO! THE CANARIES Go, Bulldogs. Go, Bulldogs, go! Whoo! Go, Bulldogs. - Really, Ben? - What? -How we doing, Bulldogs? I said, how we doing, Bulldogs? There ya go. Now, let's keep it going for your team captain, number ten, Graham Lansing! How we doing, Bulldogs? I said, how we... Just kidding, I'm not gonna do that. That's corny as hell. No offense, Principal Mossler. Ah, you got me! I do that. He got me. - Great guy. - Okay… Why do people insist on treating Graham Lansing like he's some sort of golden god? Well, because he kind of is. Please. He's just an entitled dumbass who uses his nice smile and male privilege to fail upwards and become king of the Everests. Whoa, Mandy, let's chill with the Everests, okay? And now, for the moment we've all been waiting for, the reveal of this year's prom theme. So please join me in welcoming… - It's probably old-fashioned nepotism. - Hmm. …class president, LaToya Reynolds. People let Graham Lansing get away with murder because his dad is a senator. Are you guys ready? We should be holding him more accountable... Can we just... Shut up, shut up. LaToya is about to announce the prom theme. What's the prom theme? Did you just tell me to shut up so you could hear the prom theme? Other people wanna hear it, okay? I'm just being polite. Drumroll, please! The prom theme is… -the '80s! What is happening? Oh, my God! It's a promposal. This is not a drill, people! ♪ Promposal ♪ ♪ Promposal ♪ PROM? ♪ Promposal ♪ Graham Lansing, are you asking me to prom? What? N-N-No, no, no, Jodi. Me, Owen, your-your boyfriend, is asking you to prom. - Epic fail. Oh. Yeah, sure. That's fine. Dude! She said yes. Let's hear a round of applause for the first promposal of the year! Okay, everyone. Ah, that was great. Little awkward. All right, we got about five minutes to get back to class. Now, everybody out! I'm gonna hit the faculty lounge for a cranberry juice! Let's go. - Ms. Chen. - What are you doing here? Is this my punishment because I forced you to go to the pep rally? Look, I'm still pending at Harvard, and so, I was just wondering if maybe you'd heard anything? -Mandy, it doesn't work... Oh, it's Harvard. Hello? Oh, hi. Yes. Mandy's right here. You wanna give her a full ride? And an honorary doctorate? Oh, wow. Thanks, Mr. Harvard. Thanks for calling. I'll let her know right away. I'll explain later, honey. - That wasn't Harvard. That was your wife. - No, it wasn't. It was totally Mr. Harvard. - It's not funny. - It is. You just can't see it because you're so tightly wound. "Tightly wound." Huh. Do you want to know why I'm so tightly wound? Oh, no. This is a speech again, isn't it? Because Harvard is the best school in the world. And Harvard is where my hero, development economist, Dr. Ingrid Downs went. And Harvard is where she is a tenured professor. And Harvard is where Dr. Downs, a woman who has literally won two Nobel Prizes for her work reducing global poverty, mentors young women like me who wanna change the world for the better! So, please, forgive me if I seem a little tightly wound when it comes to Harvard. I'm sorry. I didn't catch the name of the school. Is it "Hergerds"? That's funny. Mandy, there are other colleges where you can get an amazing education. Like where? Dartmouth? Get out! What? How am I supposed to become Dr. Downs' favorite student that she takes to the UN's Woman Economic Empowerment... - Out. - Fine. Bethany's staging a coup, Charles. She's trying to overthrow me as drum major. I can't hear this again. Can we talk about anything else? - Not Harvard. - Hmm. People seemed to like the whole Ghostbusters thing. Promposals are just another example of the patriarchy affirming its dominance over women. Okay, but you have to admit the '80s theme makes it kind of fun. The '80s theme makes them even worse. Can you name one popular '80s movie that isn't totally sexist? Are you being for real? Of course I can. - Dollar bet. Who you got? - Mandy, duh. - I don't know. I think Ben's got this one. - Okay. Breakfast Club. The theme is be yourself unless you want a cute boy to like you, - then get a makeover from Molly Ringwald. - Fine. Fine. Weird Science. The perfect woman is scantily clad and here to please. Revenge of the Nerds? The hero nerd tricks a girl into believing he's her boyfriend so she'll have sex with him. That's not a comedy. That's an episode of SVU. Come on, Ben. Even I knew that one. Pay up, Chuck. -Calm down. I'll Venmo you. I don't have Venmo. Finished early at soup kitchen. Pick me up at my house instead? Who you texting, huh? Your girlfriend? Just a friend. I don't have a girlfriend. Obviously. Man, I was joking. You know what, Kyle? I don't need this from you, okay? You're a freshman. I'm a senior. Treat me with some respect. Come on. You're barely a senior. You don't even drive a car. I do! I gave you a ride home. Right. Your janky Ford Fiesta! It's basically a go-kart. - You've never been to a party. - I've been to a party. With drinking? I mean, I'm sure one of the adults had a glass of wine in the other room. I bet you've never even hooked up with a girl. I've kissed a girl before. Kissed? Ugh. What are you, nine? I'm talking about your P in a V. I don't have to prove anything to you. You just did. See that guy? His P has been in some V. He's a senior. He's coming. Don't embarrass me. You're a bag boy, Kyle. That ship has sailed. - 'Sup. - How you guys doing? - Uh, Graham? - Yeah, bud? Have you, uh, decided where you're going to college yet? Not you too. Sorry. At a certain point you never want to hear that question again. You guys will understand when you're seniors. He's a senior. My bad. What school you at? Your school. - Right, right. You're, uh... - Ben Plunkett. No Nuts Plunkett. Of course! No Nuts Plunkett? Someone gave this kid a Snickers in the sixth grade field trip. Blew up like a puffer fish, like... It was crazy. You okay from that? - Yeah, I'm... I-I recovered, so… - Cool. Well, sorry I didn't recognize you, No Nuts. It's just... You look different when you're not all swollen. But, uh, see you at school. And, hey! Go, Bulldogs. Hey, girl. It's Friday night. You got a hot date? Well, I didn't wanna tell you, but yes. I'm going out with the most popular boy in school. You're going out with Graham Lansing? The Graham Lansing? Ugh, stop. Why do you guys know who that is? I actually don't know who he is. I just felt the vibe and wanted to "Yes, and." And now I can feel the vibe has shifted. I'm gonna go. So, no date with Graham? Mom, he would never date a girl like me. What? Don't look sad. Let me remind you my worth is not determined by some boy, okay? I'm my own woman, and I decide my worth. And I love that, but let me remind you that you're only young once. I mean, it's great that you give all those speeches and you were named "Best Student Economist in America." Okay, in North America. Yeah, but I think you need to have some fun, -make some memories. Put Flamin' Hot Cheetos in the principal's car! Here Oh, it was hilarious when I did it. Look, Mom. I have a very memorable… OMW! …Friday night planned with Ben. Bookstore, movies, waffles. It's the same thing you do every Friday night. See? It's memorable for you too. Hey. How was work? Work was, uh... I don't wanna talk about it. Was it that little skid mark, Kyle? What'd he say? It wasn't just him, I... Look, I said I didn't want to talk about it, okay? So, can you just stop talking about it, please? -Okay. What're you doing? Imagine Dragons Believer Imagine Dragons, really? They were my favorite band freshman year. I haven't listened to them in forever. Why are you even doing this right now? It's not like it's gonna magically make me... Whoo! NEXT WEEK 80S ACTION MOVIE MARATHON Deacon's Corner All Day Breakfast! - Seattle's Best - Thank you. - Thanks. - Julie, it's your promposal! - Yes! So, you thinking chocolate chips or no chocolate chips in the table waffle? That's amazing. You're so sweet. Hey, do you ever feel like we have wasted our youth sitting on the sidelines judging people? -So, no chocolate chips? Look at us. We... We've spent every Friday night sitting at a diner debating whether or not we wanna put chocolate on a waffle. What do you want us to be doing? - Keg stands with the Everests? - No. Maybe. I don't know. Um, you know, it's like, even Charles and Zenobia do stuff, you know? Like, they go to games, and they go to parties and dances. Who cares about that stuff? You and I know the truth. None of that matters. Okay, real life starts once we get out of here and go to college, where we get to make a real difference. Not all of us are going to Harvard. Okay? Some of us are going to an in-state college, like, 20 minutes down the road with half the Everests for the next four years, where we're gonna have to listen to them wax nostalgic about their high school glory days. Because high school is all they have. Their lives have peaked. That's why we call them Everests. But don't you wanna, just for once, feel like… like… Like what? What if this is my peak? I don't have any glory days to look back on. Okay, that's a little dramatic. That's easy for you to say. You're not No Nuts Plunkett. Forget it. I will order us a waffle. Thanks. Julie, will you go to prom with me? Yes! - Oh, my God! - Yay! Congratulations! Good job! PROM? Prom? Ha, ha. Very funny. It's not a joke. Why is this not a joke? You want trite, I give you trite. But only because you're my best friend. Okay? But no limos. I'm not paying for hair and makeup, okay? This is it. And no slow dancing. The only thing I hate more than slow dancing is the gender wage gap. Wow, you really know how to make a boy feel special. So, Benjamin Walter Plunkett, do you accept the terms and conditions of my promposal and agree to this prom pact? Mandy Elizabeth Yang, -it would be my honor. Ugh. Thank you. Yes. There's no chocolate chips in that. Yeah, well, I was mad at you when I put in the order, so… Sorry. It's a celebratory waffle. We're going to prom. ELECT - SENATOR JAMES LANSING A MAN FOR THE PEOPLE NORTH SEATTLE HIGH GO BULLDOGS! Coming up, a sit-down with Senator Lansing. We'll talk revitalizing and reelection, today on NPR. When you sleep better, you live better. Which is why sleeping on the wrong mattress is more than just a pain in the neck. Take our sleep-better quiz to find out which mattress will… Turn that off. You always say it's important to support the businesses that support NPR. I know. It's Harvard. It's updated. What does it say? Waitlisted Just leave me here. Uh, I'll see you in seven hours. - Mandy. - Don't. It's over. Harvard, Dr. Downs, saving the world, my life. It's all over. Stop. You've been wait-listed, okay? You haven't been rejected. It's the same thing. Harvard was supposed to be the place. My place. And they don't want me either. What am I looking at? Who is this sad, little person? This is not the Mandy I know. The Mandy I know would get up, march into school in her "Future is Female" T-shirt, and she would figure out a way to get into Harvard! Be that Mandy. Thank you. I need to talk to you. - I am with a student right now! - Oh, that's okay. I'll wait. Okay, the only reason I'm gonna let that fly is because I don't like that kid. - So... - I got wait-listed at Harvard. Oh. I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Just help me figure out how to get in. Mandy, let's take a beat. Maybe it's finally time to start to discuss backup schools. You know, with your grades, community service, extracurriculars... They've been applied to and forgotten. Next. Fine. You need a killer letter of rec. Okay, I can't believe I'm about to say this, but what about Graham Lansing's dad? The Harvard-alum senator? That's a great idea. Ask him. Uh, I don't know him, but I was hoping maybe you knew him. Oh, me? Yeah, we're super close. Let's just call him right now. - Ms. Chen? - No, be quiet. I'm trying to psychically connect with him. Okay, stop! You made your point. I know that a letter from a senator would seem big and flashy, but unless you have a magic in with him, get a rec from a teacher who can speak to your passion, your character, your Mandy-ness. That is your best bet. Yeah, yeah. Totally. Okay, okay. Uh, I hear you, loud and clear. She don't hear me. So, Ms. Chen told you to become BFFs with Graham Lansing so you can ask his senator father for a letter of recommendation? Uh, not in so many words. But what's with the pushback? I thought you wanted a banal, party-filled high school experience. Hanging out with Graham Lansing can give you that. Yeah, I also said I want arm muscles, but have you seen me sign up for a gym? Besides, this is... this is manipulation, okay? It's unethical. Are you really willing to compromise your values for some letter of rec? Okay, this is not some letter of rec! This is my life's ambition. Besides, there is a long history of men taking advantage of women for things far less important than Harvard. I don't know, Mandy. Put me down! He's crazy. Okay, but we would, like, hang out with all the Everests? -Probably. I'm in. Let's do it. Let's live out this little '80s movie of yours. Okay, this is not an '80s movie. In an '80s movie, Molly Ringwald falls in love with the cute boy with dimples, going to great lengths to be with him, future be damned. In my movie, Molly Ringwald falls in love with Harvard, going to great lengths to get there, dimples be damned. What are you even saying? - What are you saying? - What is the plan? Let's start with what we know and then fill in the gaps. So, aside from being a popular womanizer with a senator father, what do we know about Graham Lansing? - Uh, basketball. - Right. Um… Basketball team. Okay. Um, so a lot of gaps. Yes, lots of gaps. It just means we check his socials. Do some under-the-radar recon. Recon? Okay, well, who are we gonna ask? The only other people we talk to. Mandy, Ben told us. We are so sorry. We've ordered you an Edible Arrangement. Thanks, guys. Uh, but let's... let's talk about something normal, yeah? - Normal? - You know, like, uh… Uh, Graham. Lansing. What... What does he do? You know, besides basketball. Very under the radar. Okay. He's probably going to Kayla Jacobson's party tonight. The entire senior class is going. - I mean, besides you two. - Ouch. Noted. Zenobia, what about you? We have AP Psych together. Last week, I heard Graham talking to the teacher about needing extra credit. Zenob, baby, we gotta go. Bethany's making money moves. She's eating with the color guard girls in the band room. She will not stop until she has my head on a platter. Let's go. Okay, wait. I got it. Okay, we go to the party tonight… - Whoa, okay. - …talk to Graham. I'll offer to tutor him in psych for free. Then once I earn his trust, I will ask him to ask his dad for the letter of rec. Okay. Okay, so the plan is, uh, we... we stage a run-in with the most popular guy in school, whom we have never spoken to before, at a party that we were not invited to, and then charm him by super casually bringing up his failing grades. And then ask him for a gigantic favor. Yeah, see? Easy peasy. This is a party. Cody! Yo, what's going on, man? You okay, Ben? Yeah. Yeah, why wouldn't I be? 'Cause I've spent the last four years wishing I could be like these people but never putting myself out there for fear of being rejected? I'm totally fine. Let's just... Let's just do it. Okay. Who invited the party virgins? -I regret everything. It's okay! We can do this. We just need to find Graham Lansing, okay? I'll take here and upstairs, you take the basement and the backyard. Text if you see him. Okay? Okay. Noticeable pit stains yet? - You're good. - Okay. - Owen's coming. I'm forcing him. - I don't know! Elijah already told me he's not coming tomorrow. Like... I'm screwed! Look, I'm leading the community garden build for the basketball players and cheerleaders tomorrow morning. No one is gonna get up that early. Look at everyone. They're trashed. Yeah. They need to bring a hammer, not show up hammered, right? Lurk much? Sorry, I, um... I just, um... Would you like me to take your empties? - I'm good. - Okay. So, tell anyone who isn't completely faded to come tomorrow. 8:00 a.m. - You got it. - Copy that. Try my best. Thanks, ladies. Wanna kick it with me at prom? You're not Erica. No, I'm looking for Graham Lansing. He's not here. Close the door quickly before... Erica! Wanna kick it with me at prom? Erica, wait! Hey, have you, by any chance, seen Graham Lansing? Hi, is Graham Lansing in here? - I wish. - Hey! Okay, um, I'm so sorry to interrupt. I'm an ally, so please continue. Thanks, No Nuts. I hate my life. I shouldn't have to tell you when I want a drink. You should just know that. - Have you seen Graham Lansing? - No. Who? Graham Lansing! I know you know who he is. You people worship the ground he walks on, which is absurd because he's a Neanderthal whose only forms of communication are grunts and… - … "Go, Bulldogs!" -What? Go, Bulldogs! Ben? We gotta get outta here. Oh, thank God. I just called Graham Lansing an idiot in front of everyone, and he definitely heard. I can officially kiss Harvard goodbye. Well, maybe not officially. - I'm listening. - LaToya Reynolds said that the basketball team has a community garden build tomorrow, and as captain, I'm sure he has to go. That's not terrible. Wait. You talked to LaToya Reynolds? Kind of. I mean, I... I made a joke, and she laughed. It was funny. I'm funny, so… Oh, my God. Look at your face. You love her. What? No, no. I j... That... I'm doing... You asked me for help, so just say thank you. …and thanks in advance for all your hard work. Now, let's do this! What is wrong with this thing? Here. Let me help. No... I don't need a man's help... I mean, that would be great. Not bad for a Neanderthal, huh? Uh, look, I... I actually need to apologize for that. I mean, you're clearly not a Neanderthal. You seem very... It's... It's cool. It's cool. Uh, you are in AP Psych with my friend Zenobia, right? I don't think so. You don't have Ms. Allen third period? No, I do. Is that when your friend has her? Yeah. Guess we do have class together, then. Yeah, maybe. I took that class last year. Are you liking it? I do not like it, and it does not like me. Well, um, if you ever need help, I'd be happy to tutor you. You know, as an apology for last night. I'm all set. Are you sure? Because, you know, I got a five on the AP exam. And I'm a great tutor. I have references. And it's free! I mean, what's better than free? What's the catch? -There's no catch. We haven't spoken in ever. And now you're crashing parties and team service projects and offering to tutor me just 'cause? Come on. There's gotta be a catch. So, what is it, hmm? Do you want us to take a selfie or something? I do not want a selfie, okay? I'm just a nice person trying to do a nice thing, and if you can't see that, then that's your problem and not mine. Hey. Yo. How'd it go? Well, Graham Lansing is the narcissistic tool we thought he was. But I'm officially his tutor. Yes! What about you? You have fun with your new girlfriend? LaToya Reynolds is not my girlfriend, okay? Besides, she barely even looked at me anyway, so… So, you noticed her not looking? No, I... Just... Well... Shut up. SAVE THE BEES! SAVE HUMANITY! You're five minutes late. That's it? That's not bad. So, you're big into bees, huh? SAVE THE BEES I'm into saving them. And you should be too, if you enjoy fruits, vegetables, life. But we're here to talk psychology. -So… [sighs] …according to your syllabus… …today was about Ebbinghaus, who was fam... What was that? It's some game the freshman girls play where they take pictures of me. Keep going. Okay. Uh, so, Ebbinghaus... - Whoo! - Let's go, let's go! That's it. One, two, three, go! - No way. Mei, would you come to prom with me? Oh, my God, yes, Edward. Yes! Would you like to go talk to your friends? Oh, no. I don't know them. That's just quality content. - People eat that stuff up. - Get out! You know, I... I actually had a few questions about that. Does Jodi even like the Ghostbusters? No clue. Why? Well, I just think it would be nice if any of these promposals took into account the girl's interests or life. Instead of just being an excuse for the guy to look cool in front of his friends. But that is just me. Uh. Let's try this again. Attention, students. Don't be wack. Get your prom tickets… BACK TO THE 80S …on sale in the cafeteria now. - Hello. - Hey. One ticket for prom, please. Okay. One ticket for… - Ben Plunkett. - …Ben Plunkett. I know your name, Ben. Oh, uh, sorry. I... I... I just... did... did not think that you did. We've had classes together since middle school. We did a group project for AP Bio last year. No, I know. Wait. Do you not know my name? I do. Obviously. I mean, you're... you're like... You're you. - You don't know my name! - No, of course I do. Of course I do. LaToya Reynolds. I just mean that, you know, you're like... LaToya Reynolds, I mean, does that make any sense? Not entirely. - Try to hang on to that. - Right. But if you lose it, we have your name at the door, Ben Plunkett. Thank you, LaToya Reynolds. - There are people in line behind you. - Right, behind... Okay, I'll... So sorry. Um... Ebbinghaus was famous for his forgetting curve, which shows that you forget about 75% of the information you learn in a day without relearning or repetition. Which is kind of what makes tutoring such an effective tool. Can you stop with the tapping? Sorry, but if you're just gonna sit here and talk at me like Ms. Allen does, I'm gonna get antsy. Like it's my fault you have the attention span of a golden retriever. Well, this was fun. Thank you. I'll let you know how I do on the next test. Wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Can we start over? - I don't think this is gonna work. You're right. Follow me. You serious? You said it yourself. You get antsy. So, let's redirect that nervous energy into something else so you can focus. It'll be like a fidget spinner for jocks. We prefer the term athletes. I'm sure you do. So, Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve says you forget 75% of the information you learn in one day without relearning. - He shoots. - What did I just say? He scores. You said Ebbinghaus's forgetting curve says we forget up to 75% of the things we learn in a day without relearning them. -You might be onto something. The stereotype threat is where someone does worse academically because they're told they're not good enough. Oof. That one hits deep. Thanks a lot, Dad. Mandy, heads up. No. So, me being able to remember the last thing you said is an example of the recency effect. That actually makes sense. You can store that explicit memory… in your hippocampus. - Am I right? - You actually are. Huh. Look at me learning. -Mandy, I got an 88 on my quiz. Did Graham Lansing just hug you? Girl, that was not just a hug. He slid into your DMs with his eyes. It is on. It is not like that. Girl, it should be, 'cause he is hot. Oh, my God. Yes, I'll go to prom with you! Oh, my God! - Claire, will you go to prom with me? - Yes, I'll go to prom with you! I bet his girlfriend doesn't even like John Cusack. -It's called priming. Now, get up. New plan. You have spent all this time tutoring me. Now let me tutor you. No, I don't play basketball. What? You have to. You said that when we store memories, we store the emotion we felt at the time. And, well, you don't want me associating psychology with being sad now, do you? Okay, okay. I'll do it. Just stop making that face. Okay. So the acronym we use to teach shooting is BEEF. Now, I'm sorry if that offends you as a vegetarian. How did you know I was a vegetarian? Just assumed. Okay. BEEF. Feet shoulder width apart. Up and on the hoop. Under the ball. And, finally, follow-through. Keep moving your hand after you release the ball to finish your shot. Well, that was pathetic. Hey. What? If I said that was good, you would lose all respect for me as a coach. Okay, let's try again. Balance. Eyes. Elbow. Follow-through. Whoa! Did LeBron just get here? Okay, get ready. Let me just make one more tweak. Do I have permission to touch your arm? Yes. You flare out just a little bit here. Okay. You're good. Eyes on the basket. You sink this, it means I'm acing my psych test. No pressure. I did it! Everyone here saw it. I leave here a champion! "Oh, Graham, thank you so much for all your help. I-I couldn't have done it without you." Oh, thank you. You are a good coach. Well, I'd hope so. I coach at the rec center. - Really? - Yeah. I am the proud head coach of the nine-year-old West Division Co-Champ Lil Bulldogs. Really? I've been with them since they were wee six-year-old pups. - Really? - Could you stop sounding so surprised? Just 'cause I don't advertise it on my T-shirt, doesn't mean I'm not a good person. But if you need to see it to believe it, come with me. - Oh! -What? - Traveling! - No! - Yes! Yes! Oh! -Nice job. Okay, you guys were amazing today. So amazing, I'll make you a deal. If I make this shot… I'll bring doughnuts to the next practice. -Yeah. There will be doughnuts for everyone. - You got hops. - Really? No. But Coach always tells us sportsmanship is important. Well, he makes a good point. But, be honest, I'm not the worst girl he's brought here, right? You're the only girl he's ever brought here. Hey. Guess what? I am tutoring Graham at his house on Friday night. Where he lives with Senator Lansing. Wait. Friday night as in Mandy and Ben's bookstore-movie-waffle night? Yeah, I know. It sucks. We're gonna have to skip the bookstore and push back the movie. Are you mad? No. I mean, as long as we can make it to the movie, it's fine. It's better than fine. It's good. The Harvard Gods have given you a sign. You can't ignore them, or they might smite you and make you go to Brown. Oh, don't even joke about that. What am I doing? - Hi. - You must be Mandy. - Yeah. - Come on in. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. It's so nice to finally meet the miracle worker who helped my son get a B-plus on his test. - Oh. - He's so proud. He even put it on the fridge. -Oh. Graham? Hey. Oh, for God's sake, Graham, put a shirt on. Your tutor is here. I'll be right down. Oh. I'm so sorry. Raising four boys has taught me one thing. It's they think this whole house is a fancy locker room. - Oh. - We're lucky he's wearing pants. -So lucky. - Oh. Make yourself at home, sweetie. Okay? - Thanks. Hello. Oh, yes. I've been meaning to call you. HARVARD UNIVERSITY TEDDY LANSING National Academic Decathlon 3RD PLACE - TEDDY LANSING 2015 You found the Lansing wall of fame. It's very impressive. Your brother went to nationals in Academic Decathlon? Teddy? Yeah, he got third place. Cried afterwards. Where are you? Aw. But where's the real stuff? You know, being crowned homecoming king and winning basketball player of the year or whatever. It's called MVP. And none of that counts for the wall. According to my father, the wall is reserved for actual achievements, not silly games or popularity contests. He's a senator. His job is literally winning a popularity contest. That's what I said. And now I'm stuck on the wall with my fifth-grade graduation picture. Let's go get me on this wall for real, huh? The Babinski reflex and the Moro reflex. Correct. And that's it for today. It looks like we got time to work on that jumper. So, what's the deal with your folks? You guys get along? Person with the ball has to answer the questions. It's kind of the rule of our tutoring sessions. Fine. Uh… Yeah, we do for the most part, just normal annoying parent stuff. - You? - I don't have the ball. I don't have to answer your question. Hmm. Do you get along with your parents? Uh, yeah, with my mom it's easy. Hmm, she's a talker, but my dad… No matter how hard I try, I just... I just can't live up to his standards. You know, the only reason I took this AP class is so maybe he'd think of me as not a complete idiot for once. - Sorry. - For what? People don't wanna listen to Graham Lansing's daddy issues. I'll listen. Who's your best friend? Ben Plunkett. No Nuts Plunkett is your best friend? Yes. And don't call him that. Who's your best friend? Owen Kirksey. Favorite movie? 9 to 5. Favorite book? Unbroken. First kiss? Peter Garcia. Seventh grade. Last kiss? Sophie Homan. Kayla's party. Did you think I was just a dumb jock before this? Yes. - Did you know who I was before this? - No. Why'd you offer to tutor me? Dinner in 15 when your dad gets home. Get cleaned up. Dad's joining us for dinner? To what do we owe the pleasure? Get it all out now before he gets here. Hey, do you wanna stay for dinner? With your parents? - Right. That's weird. You don't have to... - No, I want to. Unless you wanna take it back, in which case, I don't have to. I want you to. It's why I asked. - Okay. Then I'm in. - Good. - I'm gonna go wash up. - Okay. Have I read this?? nvm. got tix. hellooooo… hv u left Graham's? So sorry gotta bail. Eating at Graham's! Ur bailing to hang with GRAHAM?! It's for my future!! His dad's gonna be here. Can you return the ticket? ill try - LaToya Reynolds! - Oh! Ben Plunkett, you scared me. Oh, I'm so sorry. So sorry. I'm just... I'm surprised to see you here. Because I'm not going to Corey Eckhart's party? Yeah, yes, 'cause I... I am definitely aware of that party. So, why aren't you going? Every once in a while, I just need a break from that scene. Yeah, I mean... [scoffs] Same. I thought you could relate. Uh... What are you here to see? Infinite Doom. Scary movies are not my thing, but where Michael B. Jordan goes, I follow. Well, I'm here to see that too. Do you wanna go together? Not together, of course. Obviously not together. I just meant, like, would you... Would you wanna go as friends? Or you know what? Now that I say it out loud, friends may be presumptuous. I can totally hear that now. What I mean to say is that I have this extra ticket, and you can totally have it if you want it. And it would just be, like, one classmate helping out a fellow classmate. Nothing more than that. You know what? We don't even need to sit next to each other if you don't want to, so… I'd be happy to help out a fellow classmate. And we can sit next to each other. Great. 'Cause the seats are assigned. So your dad won't be joining us. He got pulled into last-minute drinks with a donor. Can't be missed. Reelection's right around the corner. Well, I, for one, am shocked. Stop it. He works hard. So, Mandy, where are you off to next year? The way Graham talks about you, I imagine you must have your pick of schools. Well... You know, my first choice is Harvard. I wanna study under Dr. Downs. She's this amazing... I know who she is. I love her. - I went to her book signing last year... - Uh, me too. - What? - Yeah. Where have you been hiding? The last girl Graham brought home asked why we didn't live in the White House. Mandy's my tutor, Mom. - Okay? She's not like Tess. - No. - Or Jenna or Hannah or Taylor. - Stop. Kidding. Mandy, so please, go on. You're going to Harvard. Oh, hopefully. I got wait-listed. Oh, that's a shame. Did you know my husband went to Harvard? Uh, no. I had no idea. Wow. That is so impressive. You know, I would love the opportunity to pick his brain. See if he has any tips. Only if he has the time. Oh, well, clearly his schedule is unpredictable. But, you know, next weekend there's a fundraiser where he's being honored. The whole family is going. You should come. You could talk to him then. - You don't have to. - I would love to. Excellent. I will have Graham get you the details. - What did you think of the movie? - I'm just gonna say it. - Michael B should be in every movie. - Okay. Even the old ones. Titanic, Godfather, Citizen Kane. Go back. Remake 'em all with him in it. Okay. So, you liked it? It... It was hard to tell. You spent the whole movie like this. I did not. I'm pretty sure I have a bruise on my arm from how hard you were leaning into me. Shut up! - Oh, I'm sorry. Did that hurt? - A little. Well, this is me. I had fun. I'm glad Mandy canceled. You said you two usually grab waffles after a movie? Yep. - Do you wanna... - I will see you at school. See you at school. See you at school? What are you doing, Ben? Why am I running? This is only making it worse. Why am I making it worse? You made quite the impression on my mom tonight. I guess I have Britney, Tiffany, Rachel and Jessica to thank. -You're just making up those names. But how many of them are girls you've dated? Uh, two-ish. Oh, I feel bad for that ish-girl. No, she was very happy. Gross. Good night, Graham. Wait, wait. I'm glad you're coming to the fundraiser. My dad's gonna freak when I show up with a Harvard girl. The hopeful Harvard girl. Look, either way, he'll be very impressed. He wouldn't even let me apply there, and I'm a legacy basketball recruit… …but my dad didn't think I would be able to hack it, so… "Let's just minimize potential embarrassment." That's rough. But you should've done it anyway. You don't have to live your life for his approval. You my tutor or my therapist? Sorry. You didn't ask for my opinion. No, no. I… I like hearing it. All right. I could stay here all night, but Coach will kill me if I don't get sleep before the tournament. - Right. Good luck. - Don't miss me too much. Oh, finally. Okay. Is this jacket '80s enough? 'Cause I asked Ruth, and she said the women's jackets would fit my shoulders better. But I don't have lady shoulders, do I? Uh, no, your shoulders are totally normal. Whoa. I just insinuated having lady shoulders was a bad thing, and you didn't even notice. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Sorry, I'm fine. I... It's just that Graham Lansing is not who I thought he was. It's like when you find out your parents aren't just your parents and had a whole life before you. It feels kinda weird, you know? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. This one's kinda good though, right? Your shoulders are too narrow for that jacket! Thank you, Ruth! - She's got a point. - Are you serious right now? - I'm kidding. Sort of. - Okay. I think you can do better. Ooh. Wear it like a cape. Great Scott, will you go to prom with me? Oh, my God! Yes! - Oh, my God. I love this. - Oh, thank you. You have to… Because I know how much you love promposals. Attention, this is a reminder. The library is for reading… bc i know how much you love my selfies …not for scrolling your social medias. Deleting this ASAP Wouldn't want the girls to be jealo Mandy! Who you texting? Uh, my mom. - What's up? - Where are we going Saturday night? I'm thinking we class it up and go to the Olive Garden. - What are you talking about? - My birthday dinner. Crap. The fundraiser with Graham's dad is Saturday night. Seriously? Graham again? Not Graham. The letter. Oh, let's do Friday night instead. I told you we're going to my grandma's retirement community on Friday. Ben, I'm so sorry. But you can still go with Charles and Zenobia on Saturday. No, I can't, because they have band competition. Mandy, this sucks. What am I supposed to do now? I can't go to the Olive Garden by myself on my birthday. That's humiliating. I know. I know. I'm sorry. -But Saturday night is it. Okay? Once I talk to the senator, it'll be back to us. You kill me in Scattergories while I rant about billionaires not paying taxes. Normal times. Promise. What about LaToya Reynolds? You said you had a good time at the movies. I can't ask LaToya Reynolds to the Olive Garden on my birthday. That's worse than shaking her hand. Trust me, nothing is worse than shaking her hand. - LaToya Reynolds! - Hey. Ben has a question for you. Hi. Yeah. I do have a question for you that I wanted to ask. And I... I guess I'll... Well, first of all, cool puffy shirt. I just wanted to say that. And I also just wanted to say that I am... My birthday is coming up. I'm having a birthday, um, dinner on Saturday. If you would like to come to that birthday dinner, you can totally come to it. - What time? - Anytime. -I'm in, Ben Plunkett. - We're going to the Olive Garden! - And she said yes. - Okay. Get to class. - Okay. BUYFRESHMARKET - Have a good day, sir. - Thank you. -Happy birthday! - You did not have to get me all this. - Whoa, selfish. I am buying this for myself, thank you. You're getting soda with single-use plastic? -Okay, it's all for you. I'm sorry that I'm missing your birthday dinner tonight. Is there anything else you want me to get? Just a Harvard letter so I can get my best friend back. Sorry. Cheap shot. Nah, it's okay. I deserve it. But it's for the best that I'm not going tonight. I wouldn't want to get in the way of you spitting that game. - I have no game. - Having no game is your game. Thank you? Look, I'm just saying, I know dinner with the LaToya Reynolds is a big deal. But you are Ben Plunkett, okay? You're smart and funny and charming, even though you don't know it. - She's lucky to be going out with you. - Attention, shoppers. - Remember that. - Especially you, Jenny. Nobody puts Baby in the corner. - Turn around. - No. It's happening. - Jenny, will you go to prom with me? - Yes! - Oh, dear God. - Just go. All right. Have fun tonight. You too. Screw it. Phones are too addictive anyway. She was so excited. She couldn't wait to see One Direction. Then the concert started, and she sobbed from the second they walked on stage until the final bow. Dad. Dad, uh, what are you doing? Uh, just showing Graham some pictures. I didn't know you were such a One Direction fan. I was 11, so… Were you 11 when you were singing, "You Don't Know You're Beautiful" in the shower last week? ♪ Oh, oh You don't know you're beautiful ♪ ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Okay, it's "What Makes You Beautiful," and, uh, we should go. But first, I need to ask about this. Her Halloween costume. She was Tom Cruise from Risky Business. And for the next month, she would come home from school every day, put on one of Tom's shirts and slide around the house in her socks. Hmm. Letting a third-grade girl dress up as a kid who runs a brothel. That's very forward-thinking, Mom. Yeah, it was. Because now I have this adorable picture to blackmail you with. Uh, Mandy's right. We should head out. Mr. and Mrs. Yang, it was nice meeting you. Have her back by 2:00. - 2:00? - Oh, 3:00. He will have me back by midnight. Yes. Have fun. Come on. 2:00 a.m., Tom? Really? She's never gone on a date before. How am I supposed to know? Well, that happened. Those photos are the bane of my existence. No. I liked it. Please. It's not exactly the wall of fame in there. What are you talking about? Your whole house is a wall of fame. They love everything you do. No achievements necessary. So, have you decided where you wanna go to college? Uh, no, not yet. Coach wants me to play ball at State. Owen's pushing for ASU so we can room together. And then there's my dad's choice, UT. "A respectable yet attainable Public Ivy." Hmm. But where do you wanna go? I don't know. Right now, I'm just happy to be here. Thank you. -LaToya Reynolds! Ben, you have got to start saying my name at a normal volume. Sorry. I... You're... You're here. Well, yeah, you invited me. I know, but then you came, so… Should we go get a table? Yeah, we should. That's what happens next. I promise I've been to a restaurant before, so… SENATOR LANSING WELCOMES YOU TO OUR ANNUAL FUNDRAISING EVENT Wow. Come on. So, the key is to keep your head down and keep moving. Don't make eye contact with anyone. Because if you do, you'll get stuck in some boring conversation with some boring donors who just wanna butter you up to good ol' Senator Lansing. All right. You're exaggerating. No, I'm not. My brothers are all trapped right now. There's Teddy. And Nate. Oh. Logan just got free. Logan. -Made eye contact. Rookie mistake. You guys are quite the hot commodity at these things. Yep. My dad loves it. So when you meet him tonight, mention Harvard right away before anyone with money swoops in. Hey, Graham. Ah, we've been spotted. We gotta move. -Oh, no. I'm not slow-dancing. Oh, come on. Just pretend it's 1D. Oh, you're a natural. Just like on the court. So, when you look back on high school, what do you think your biggest regret will be? The 94 in PE that cost me valedictorian. You? I always thought it would be missing the free throw in the City Finals. But now? That I took so long to get a tutor. Hmm. Do lines like that work for you? I don't know. I never needed a line. People just come to me with their expectations of who I am or who I should be… but I don't know. With you, it's… Everything's different. Good different or bad different? Definitely good different. Still thinking about that 94 in PE? A little bit. You should probably kiss me one more time. So, why did you come to Kayla Jacobson's party? I mean, besides to collect people's trash. Right, um, uh, well, I... I guess I just felt like I was letting the authentic high school experience pass me by. Like, um, you know, what you all do. Like, uh, with the fun and the games and, um, uh, going to parties. I wanted to see what that was like. And? Not for me. I'm beginning to think it's not for me either. Cheers. Graham Lansing? Oh, I thought we lost him. Go. Save yourself. I'll meet you back at the table. What happened this season? I don't know. - I'm so sorry. - Senator Lansing. Uh... - Yeah. Uh... Well, that is the beauty of drinking in dark suits. Hides all the spills. Um, did I see you here with my son? Yes, uh, Mandy Yang. It's very nice to meet you. - You're tutoring him, right? - Yeah. Yeah, well, as the man who used to quiz him on his times tables, I know that is not an enviable task. Oh, he's actually doing very well. Barely even needs me. Oh, you're very sweet to say so. Now, my wife tells me that you are applying to Harvard? Yes, sir, I am. Well, that's my alma mater. If there is anything I can do to say thank you for the help, I'm happy to. Although, I'm not so sure even Harvard is enough payment for what you're putting yourself through with Graham. That boy. That boy is incredible. And you should be proud of him. He's funny and kind. And he makes every person he talks to feel like the most important person in the room. Especially me. And so, I... I appreciate the offer… I don't need anything as a thank-you. I'm good. - Senator Lansing. - Bill. Very nice to meet you, Mandy. You too, sir. Did you see Graham making out with that girl on the dance floor? - Don't move. Sorry. - Gotta hand it to him. - The kid commits to a bit. - What's that supposed to mean? Come on. Graham never brings a girl to these, and the first time he does, it's some brainiac Harvard wannabe? Come on. It's obvious. He's trying to show Dad he's not the dumb kid because some smart girl likes him. - Wait. - He's parading her around tonight, but he spent all afternoon holed up in the basement with that girl he was hooking up with last summer. The blonde lifeguard from the pool? No, the other one. The dancer. Hey, guys. Graham, what's the name of that girl who was over today? Liv. [sighs] Shut up. Mandy might hear you. Oh... Your girlfriend? Come on. You've got three of them. - It's not funny. - Just the one? - Come on, man. What? Come on. Hi. Mandy, you made it. -Hey, are you okay? Yeah, I just... I don't feel well. So I need to go. I need to leave. Uh. Slow down. What... Yes, I like Robert Downey Jr. too. But Captain America is clearly the heartbeat of the MCU. That's why they pass on the shield, not the Iron Man suit. I give up. I give up. I never would have taken you for a true believer. I wasn't. But I told you, where Michael B. goes, I follow. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ -♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Spam call. ♪ Happy birthday Dear valued customer ♪ ♪ Happy birthday… ♪ Unknown ♪ …to you ♪ Hello? Ben! Ben, I don't have my phone, and you're the only number I know. Could you pick me up? -Mandy? I'm so stupid. So, so stupid. This was all a mistake. - What's going on? - I... - Is everything okay? - Oh, God. I... I shouldn't have called. Uh... I'm so sorry. I... Have fun. I'll figure it out, okay? Um. I... I have to go. - Why? What happened? - I... I don't know exactly, but, um… D-Do you need something? Uh, we can't leave until you blow out the candle. -All right! - Yeah! - Okay. I'm so sorry, but this is an emergency, and I will call you later, okay? - I promise. - Ben, wait. Are you serious? Take your time. Tip's not included. Wait. Do you take Apple Pay? Ladies and gentlemen, I stand here with great honor for the opportunity to introduce a man who has relentlessly worked for the American people. There's nobody better fit for reelection… ELECT SENATOR LANSING A MAN FOR THE PEOPLE …than my good friend, the honorable Senator Lansing. - You didn't have to... - Get in. I'm such an idiot. You know, I thought Graham Lansing liked me. Like... Like, like-liked me. I mean, how stupid am I? - You are not stupid. - No, I am. I am. Because Graham's dad offered me the letter and I said no. I chose Graham, and he chose Liv from the dance studio. You know, I was a pawn in his game. I got outplayed by an Everest. And you wanna know the worst part? I've been a terrible friend. I mean, I've missed lunches and Friday nights. And your freaking birthday. But I am gonna make it up to you. Okay? At prom. Limos and fancy dinners. Okay? Whatever you want. If you'll still go with me. Of course I will. You are my best friend. Besides, we made a pact. Gotta honor it. I'm so sorry I ruined your date with LaToya Reynolds. It's okay. She totally understood. - Gotta go. - And bye! - Bye. - Peace. Hey, did you get my texts? You okay? Whoa. Mandy, what's going on? Can we talk? Sure. Yeah, let's talk. Did you have fun with Liv on Saturday? How did... Y-You weren't supposed to know about that. Wait! It's not what you think! Mandy. Take the hint, dude. LaToya... Take the hint, No Nuts. BIOLOGY Mmm. Thank you. Mandy, go to the front office. They have something for you. - Now? - No, you can go when the bell rings. -Boom! Pencils down, everybody. Hand 'em in. - LaToya Reynolds! - That has stopped being cute, Ben. I'm sorry about that. And about Saturday night. Mostly about Saturday night. Uh... How much do I owe you for dinner? I don't want your money. I don't want anything from you, 'cause I'm not here to be your second choice to Mandy Yang or anyone else. No, no, you're not! Can you just please, please hear me out? You have until I get to my car. Talk fast. Okay... Uh, okay. …and she's my best friend, so I was there. But I can honestly say, until that phone call came in, that was the best birthday I ever had. Because of you. Hi, uh... I'm Mandy Yang. I got a note saying there was something here for me. If I had a time machine, the very first thing I would do is... Okay, I would probably stop some wars and some genocides. But then after that, I would go right to Saturday night... Okay, I get it. I get it. - You're sorry. - Yeah. Nope. Nothing. - Okay. - But these are all just words, Ben. I know. I know I-I... I screwed up, and "I'm sorry" is not enough. Uh… You never deserve to feel less than. So, can I please, please make it up to you? Let me take you somewhere nicer than the Olive Garden. How does the Macaroni Grill sound? Good. Okay. But maybe instead of Macaroni Grill, we go to prom together. What? Ben Plunkett, will you go to prom with me? Uh… Get ready. What the hell? Okay. Get ready to record. She has no idea. Hmm? A promposal? No! No. ♪ Mandy, you light up my world Like nobody else ♪ ♪ The way that you tutor me Gets me overwhelmed ♪ ♪ Your fight for human rights Makes you hot as hell ♪ ♪ Mandy Oh, oh, oh ♪ ♪ Will you go to prom with me? ♪ So? Say yes! Say yes! Say yes! Ben. Graham just asked me to prom. LaToya just asked me to prom. -That's great! Why isn't that great? Well, when I told her that I was going with you, she was pissed. But, uh, what did Graham say when you told him? - Uh… - You didn't tell him? You said yes? Two nights ago, you were crying in my car telling me that Graham Lansing was using you and that he had a girl on the side. I know. I know. But I was wrong about all of it. -She was helping him plan the promposal. My promposal. So just tell LaToya what happened. What? You want me to tell LaToya that you got a date, so now I'm free? Yeah, that'll go over real well. What the hell, Mandy? Okay. Calm down. No! Don't tell me to calm down! You asked me to prom! We had a pact! We freaking double-tapped it! I-I know. I know, and I'm... I'm sorry. Oh. Oh, you're sorry? You're sorry. I... I did not realize you were sorry. Well, then it's totally cool. Forget about it. Mandy, I am supposed to be your best friend. I am not some doormat for you to wipe your feet on when your life falls to crap. Do you even like Graham Lansing? Do you? Or is this all part of your con to get a letter for Harvard from his father? You know what? I... I don't even care. I don't, just... Have fun being an Everest, Mandy. Hey, Mandy. Come here. I wanna show you this video. Do you even like Graham Lansing? Or is this all part of your con to get a letter for Harvard from his dad? You know what? I... I don't even care. Have fun being an Everest, Mandy. - No, I can explain. - You don't need to. Made my dad write it before he left. - Graham... - I gotta hand it to you, Mandy. You played me perfectly. You even had me convinced there wasn't a catch. I really am a Neanderthal. Best of luck Mandy We do not wanna take sides - in this whole thing. - No. You're both our friends, and we know this was a complicated situation. But we did invite Ben to eat with us in the band room. He shouldn't be alone 'cause he didn't do anything wrong, you know? But, again, we are not taking sides. - How are you holding up? - Barely. Um, you know when I said that you needed an in with the Senator, you know I didn't mean in his son's pants, right? So, what happened, Mandy? Well, I used tutoring to get close to him so I could get the letter. Hey, Mandy! I know it's short notice 'cause it's this weekend, but my dad works at the senior center, and I was wondering, if he writes you a letter of recommendation, will you go to the prom with me? But things changed. Feelings changed. But that's ruined. As is my friendship with Ben. NUT-FREE ZONE As is whatever he had with LaToya. And now I am officially the Hester Prynne of our school. And then… …there's this. Are you gonna send it in? I have to. It's Harvard. There's nothing that beats Harvard. Is there? A few months ago, I would have said that Harvard is the most important thing in Mandy Yang's life. - But now? - If you haven't mailed it in, maybe there are other things that are more important to you now. What do I do? I can't tell you that, but I support any decision you make. Thank you. Just not publicly. You're kind of poison right now. Hey, you should really leave. Will you give him this? For me? Tell him I'm sorry. For everything. Okay. Graham. - "Eruption." Van Halen. - Yes! -How did you know? -Because I know my man. And whenever you go… …I know it's "Eruption." Can I take the car? Uh, keys are on the hook. - Uh, where are you going? - Prom. - With who? - Maybe no one. Bye. - She's going to the prom! - The prom! -Yes! Go home, Mandy. Wait! Wait, wait, wait. Hear me out. Please. Yeah, I screwed up. Majorly. I took you for granted, and I made you feel like you weren't a priority in my life, and I'm sorry. But wherever our futures take us, I need to know that you're my best friend. And, more importantly, I need you to know that I'm your best friend.

Green Books Deacon's Corner Wow. -I know. This place is fancy. But don't worry about the price. I'm paying, so get whatever you want. Just no bacon, because it's terrible for the environment. I missed you, Mandy. I missed you too, Ben. I'm so sorry. Enough. You know, we... we both could have handled things a lot differently. I could have not screamed at you in a parking lot full of people, you know? And I could have done pretty much the opposite of everything I did, so… Are we okay? We're okay.

Everyone just kind of ignores that day of because, you know, pictures exist. And you'd know that if you ever went to a dance before. - Or just had Instagram. - Thank you. You wanna dance? Let's go. I feel like we should just go. Probably. - But we are not going to. - Oh, okay. - Sorry. - Excuse me. Any noticeable pit stains yet? Oh, very much so. Yeah. -Worth it. Yeah. Okay.

And now I'm gonna go home and look at dorms for backup schools. Oh, God. I totally forgot to ask, so… Harvard is a no? I actually haven't checked, but I'm starting to realize there's more to life than just Harvard, you know? What? No! No! I do not know! We did not go through hell for you to give up on Harvard. Please check your phone. - Check your phone right now. - No, I... As King and Queen of this prom, we demand you to get out your damn phone. Okay. Hey. Whatever happens… we can deal with it. Waitlisted MY APPLICATION Accepted I got in. I got in! - Really? Harvard? - Yes! - Dr. Downs? It's really happening? - Yes! Oh, my God. Okay. You two are a lot. But I'm here for it. Let's celebrate. Ms. Chen! Ms. Chen! I got into Harvard! - Congratulations, Mandy. - I don't even know how it happened. I mean, I didn't send in the letter of rec. I swear. Well, someone else must have done it. Like who? It was me, dummy! It was just a boring, unsexy teacher rec. And who would know it? It actually worked. I don't even know what to say. That's all the thanks I need. Now get out there. No, really. I can't believe it... Oh, would you listen to me for once in your life? Go! Leave me alone! Okay. Hi, I'm Mandy Yang, your salutatorian because I got a 94 in PE. And today… Well, today, um, I was going to give a speech filled with words of wisdom from my heroes like Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Ingrid Downs. But instead, I'd like to share some advice I got from someone very important to me. And that advice is: BEEF. Balance. Eyes. Elbow. Follow-through. - What is she doing? - I don't know, but I am gonna film it. Now, for those of you who are not sports aficionados like myself, BEEF is how you teach someone to shoot a… layup? - No. - A free throw? Free throw. A free throw. Um, sorry. Uh, it's how you teach someone to shoot a free throw. Uh, but it also applies to life. Balance. It's something I didn't have enough of. You know, it's... it's important to have goals, but don't let pursuing those goals become your entire life. Work hard but also have fun. Laugh, dance, fill up a car with Flamin' Hot Cheetos. -Yes! Eyes. Keep them open. You never know who you might meet. Elbow. Keep them safe. They're important. And finally, follow-through. When you take a shot, make sure to finish it. So to that end… Graham Lansing. Thank you for making my last semester of high school different. Good different. And to my fellow seniors… CONGRATULATIONS GRADUATES …oh, I hope whatever life brings you next is good different too. Oh, and one more thing. Go, Bulldogs! We love you! I can't believe you're going to Boston right now. I know, but I couldn't say no to Dr. Downs's offer to sit in on her... - Summer lectures on Global Poverty. - Poverty. I know, I know. I just... I am gonna miss you. -I'm gonna miss you. But I will be back before Labor Day, so you'll have to pencil me in in between dates with your new girlfriend. - Can you believe I have a girlfriend? - Can you believe it's LaToya Reynolds? At what point will you two stop referring to me by my full name? Probably never. Oh. I should go. Bye, Ben. Bye, Mandy. Oh. Hey. Congratulations, graduate. Double congrats to you. That was... That was some speech. I'll always remember to protect my elbows because of you. Good. That is what I was hoping you took from that. So, Harvard, huh? Yeah. What about you? You decide where you're going? UT. Your dad's choice. - I mean, it's a... It's a great school. - Yeah, I know what you mean. But, hey, good luck. I'll call you if I need a tutor. And I will call you if I join the girls' basketball team. Bye, Graham. Bye, Mandy. You ready? Yeah, I am. Let's go. CAMBRIDGE, Ma EPA ACT NOW Bee aware I'm gonna get a refill. You guys want anything? - Sure thing. - Yes, please. Thanks. Hey, could I get a refill? Sure. Graham, order up! Mandy. Graham. Is that a Save the Bees shirt? Is that really what you wanna talk about? No, no. But what are you doing here? Well, I was all set to go to UT because that's what was gonna make my dad happy, but someone once told me not to live my life for his approval. So I'm here, taking a gap year, just trying to figure out what I wanna do, you know? Oh. And... And what you want is here in... in Boston? Yeah. Yeah, it is. Working non-profit, coaching inner-city kids. It's really a great program. Yeah. That sounds like a... Like a perfect fit. I'm really happy for you. Thanks. You know, um, there is one other reason I... The end…
