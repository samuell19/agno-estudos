End of Winter Now I'll take pictures. Sir, please put up a little bit. One, two, three. One more. One, two, three. Family! Come forward. Congratulations. Could you all move a little toward the center. Just a little more, more. Sir, could you turn the bouquet? Yes, there. Thank you. Students, move out of the way. Ready? One, two, three. One more. One, two, three. Okay. We're done. Could you take one more with this? Yes. One more. One, two, three. We're done. Thank you. Let me carry that for you. Let's go. How have you been lately? Well, there are over 40 teachers under me. It's reshuffling season. There are so many farewell parties to attend. That must be so hard. When you come to Seoul next time, visit my nail shop. How long did it take to get here? I think it was 3 hours. The traffic was bad with the snow. What about you? Roughly 2 hours on the expressway. How is your company? People are going on about pharmaceutical companies and rebate penalty... That's no news. Even the company doesn't care. How was the retirement ceremony? It was the first time I have ever been to one. It was nice. Nice... What was nice about that? I was touched when they played the song 'Teacher's Grace' in the end. No, a retirement ceremony should be full of teachers and students. So few students came. I have never seen such an ungraceful event in my life. Did nobody like you in school? Is Su-hyeon still far from here? He is almost here. Sir. Sir. Yes. How long... Very soon. How soon is very soon... Quite soon. Yes. Are you the eldest son of Mr. Kim? Yes. It's nice to meet you. It is nice to see the whole family come together for his retirement ceremony. Sorry, but could you take this? Yes. Yes. Let me pour that for you. No, it's all right. What is taking so long? Why don't you go and check again? He said soon. You're always like that. You're a salesperson. Why can't you make things happen? I will go and check. Here you are. Sorry. Why are you so late? Snow is falling like mad. Traffic was bad. - Is it snowing that much? - I'm sorry. - Is it really snowing that much? - Yes, like mad. Oh no, then we should hurry up. Brother! How is work these days? Congratulations, dad. Is this yours? It's okay. Good. Mom, what are we having? You will have whatever we are having. Go and tell them to hurry up. It's all right. We have time. Sorry it took so long. You must be hungry. No, it's okay. To be honest, it took too long. I'm so sorry. The chef couldn't come today. We will order the second course now. Yes, what would you like? Spicy soup noodle is our specialty. We will just all have the noodle with bean sauce. No, I want spicy soup noodle. Just have a bean sauce noodle. Spicy soup noodle. Bean sauce noodle. Okay. Try some of this. No, I'm fine. You guys go ahead. Try some. No, it's fine. Would you like some? Let's not do that. It's inconvenient. Yes. Yummy. It's not that good. All that waiting was for nothing. The food doesn't suit you? What do you think? It was just what I would expect from a place like this. I like it. Congratulations. You have worked so hard. Since we are all here, give us a speech. What speech. Who keeps texting you? Give it back. Why are we here if you are going to drink by yourself? It's very nice to be here together like this. It's none of your business. Yes, it's a woman. When someone is talking to you... Hey, be quiet. I am talking to you. Why won't you answer? After all these years, I still can't get used to that. Come on, today is a day of celebration. Dad, when are you moving your stuff? Can't you hear him? Why don't you say a word? See. I was right. It is a woman. Give it. Don't. Give it to me. Let me check. Hey! I'm getting divorced. What did you just say? Divorce? Yes, divorce. Let's get divorced. With who? Me? Have you gone mad on a few drinks? Was this what you had in mind? A divorce? Everyone, go back home. Travelling will be harder if it keeps snowing. Ayu mother, mother... Oh dear, where are you going? This is too much for me. Why on earth am I wearing this? Please calm down, dear. Let's go back in and talk it over. I don't want to talk now. Not in this mood. Your clothes are all wet. You can't go anywhere like this. At least, you should get changed. What do you think there is to say? After hearing that nonsense... What is there to say? Mother... It's all wet. What shall we do... Did you know anything about this? Mom was all right at home. How would I have known? Did something happen at the retirement ceremony? Nothing happened. What's going on? You really don't know? I said I don't know. Let go! You're all the same! Mom, calm down. Warm yourself up. It is cold outside, isn't it? Are you leaving already? I was making dessert. It's fine. The children have to go back. Where are you going to? We will stop by the bus terminal, then I'm going home. If you're going back to the school residence, I can give you a lift. No, it's okay. I can get a taxi. Sir, let me give you a lift. It will be hard to get a taxi in this weather. Here you are. Come on. Let's go. Come out. Let's go. Come. I feel bad for those military boys back there. They can't go home because of snow. You must be happy. You can go traveling with your wife from now on. Can you let me get off? Mom. I can't breathe. It's choking in here. You can pull over around here somewhere. Thank you for the ride. No, since I'm here, I should take you to your door. No, it will be hard to turn the car. You should go. Mr. Kim, will you be all right? Don't worry. Wow, father knows how to keep the house tidy. I'm cold. Honey. - Yes. - Water. Yes. Father is awesome. He's probably better than most housewives. What are you looking at me for? Are you going somewhere? Yes, I should shovel the snow. Su-hyeon, get up! I'm leaving! Mom, I need to warm up. Then stay where you are. Call me a taxi. Where are you going? Why can't you calm down! You're taking turns picking on me? Can't you imagine how hard it is for me? You guys stay here. I'm going to a motel. If you leave, I'll be the only woman here. It will be comfortable. Don't worry, my mom won't go anywhere without me. There are no buses or taxis. Let me go. You can't go to a motel. You can't go with your clothes all wet. Let me change my clothes. My clothes! Yes. I think we can use that room to change. What are you doing? Yes. How about next week? Tuesday? Tuesday is good. Yes, Tuesday seven o' clock? Yes, I'll see you then. Mr. Park, please help us out until next week. No, no. Thank you. Yes, just come and don't worry about anything. I'll take you out for a big night. Yes. Thank you. Yes, yes. What is this scruff... Why is he keeping this waste... Hye-jeong. Yes. I can't breathe in here. Let's go out. Okay. Bring my coat and bag. Yes. Brother. Dong-wook. What? Ask dad. Ask what? You know what. Why he wants to divorce. I don't care. Go and ask him discretely. Maybe there is a woman. What are you saying? You know... People are like that. Not our father. I don't want two separate family engagement meetings. Hey. And dad, is that still there? Hello. Ji-yeong, hold on. We will see. I don't think they are going to court right away. Don't worry. I will take care of it. And don't tell anyone, okay? It's a surprise What are you doing? It's nothing. I will call you back. Stop that babbling. What? Watch your mouth. Eat some. It's okay. The potatoes are good this year. Try some. How is the wedding preparation going? When will this end that parents are subtropical or time? I think they will have time next month. Father. Is there something? No, there is nothing. Eat slowly. Is it good? Huh? Does that still go down your throat easily? What? Stop acting like a child. Why are you trying to pick a fight all day? I won't eat it if that's what you want. Hey! Hey! Mother. What? Are you okay? Let's make spicy potato soup for dinner. Dong-wook likes it. No, he doesn't. What? He doesn't really eat potatoes. What are you talking about? He likes potatoes as much as I do. No, he doesn't eat much potato. He likes dried cabbage leaves. Dried cabbage leaves? That was probably one time. No, he really likes them. What is this? Don't you know these sleeping pyjamas? Would you like a pair? No, I have a pair. By the way, are you going to spend the night here? Dong-wook told me that it will be difficult to go back today. Why don't you stay too? I'll see. Do we have everything we need? - Yes. - Let's go. Wait a minute. I can't cook with these clothes on. This doesn't mean I'm staying for the night. No. Just a minute. - This too. - Yes. Hold on. Pass me that. We will pay separately for these. Okay, I will delete that from here. No, verbal contract is a still contract. We should do it. No, I can't be there this week. I will sign the contract on 25th and make the payment on the moving day. Yes, please put in a good word for me with the landlord. What? Is there something you want to say? No. Mother. Did you drain the blood from the meat? I immersed it in cold water. If you don't drain it properly, the food will smell like a pig. By the way, I should have gotten dried cabbage leaves. Dong-wook can eat a lot of them. I like them too. How old fashioned you are for a young person. People ate them when times were tough. Who eats them nowadays? Perilla leaves go much better with spicy potato soup. People eat them these days as healthy diet food. Why don't you take a rest now? I will finish it. It's distracting! Okay. Hye-jeong. Yes. This is really good. Really? How did you make this? I can do better if I use artificial sauce like she did. I'm losing all my appetite. What's wrong? I'm enjoying it. I wonder why it's snowing so heavily. I wonder if we can go back tomorrow. Leave it. I'll do it. No, it's all right. Thank you. It was very good. I was so embarrassed at dinner. You should have backed me up. Is mother going through her menopause? Sorry. Did you talk? What? Talk to your Father. The realtor called earlier. There is a competitor. He said we should hurry up if we want it. That's what realtors always say. And I can't bring that up now. You're a family. You're very different from when you're at work. I have to be different at work. You should handle this like work. You can tell him we will pay back with interest. It's easier between family. I can't talk about money in this situation. You said you would talk to him after the retirement ceremony. You said so. You. It's tough enough for me handling your mother. All right. I'll talk to him when the right moment comes. What right moment? Talk to him. Okay. Oh dear, your shoulder is stiff. Okay. Leave it. Your hands are so dry. Do you have a dry skin type? I don't know about skin types. It has always been like this. Your hands are this dry, Your skin type is 'very dry'. Are you doing outdoor work these days? No, I don't do any work. I just stay in. You shouldn't leave it like that. Do you have any body oil? I think we can use this. Let me do it for you. Give me your hand. Come on. It's all right. It's okay. This will make your skin really soft. You should use hand cream. It's the same. It was always like walking on thin ice. I don't know. I can talk to mom. I will take care of the house. Don't worry. Tomorrow? I should go back tomorrow if the weather is clear. Okay. All right. Sleep tight. It's been a long time since the three of us slept together like this. Isn't it the first time ever since you went to college? We used to sleep together when we were kids, remember? Are you asleep? Sleep. I'm tired. Is dad asleep? I can't sleep. What's wrong? Can't you sleep? I can't sleep. It's hot and stuffy in here. You're hot? You're not coming down with something? No, it has been like this for some time. I can't sleep at night. I feel hot and stuffy. Get some sleep, you must be tired. Your mother. Would you like some water? Is there any beer? No, but there is soju. Soju... I'll have that. By the way, did you talk to father? No, what is there to say... This is strong, I can't drink this. Would you like some snack? No, it's okay. Give me one of those. What? Come on. Have one if you like. No, I'm okay. It's fine. Go ahead. We're not drinking. You don't have to turn like that. You don't have to. Okay. I've been notified of my own divorce today. Smoking to my face is not a big deal. It is beautiful. It's beautiful. It's very cold. Let's walk a little more. Yes. Isn't it beautiful? Look at that. You don't see that in Seoul. We need to talk. Don't make me go crazy! Talk to me. Is there another woman? Is that it? I guess you don't have the balls. Talk to me! Did I ever say we should split up? Don't stand in the cold and go back inside. You should freeze to death! You! Aren't you going to talk? Stop. Talk. Talk! Are you going to throw that? Throw it! Go ahead! Is that it? Did you throw that at me? What did you throw just now? How dare you! Did you call the bus terminal? Yes, I called earlier. They said there are no buses today. That is absurd. Two days? Do you think that makes sense? Call again and don't talk to the staff. Talk to the manager. Talk directly to the manager, so it's clear. Okay? Yes, I will. Mom, they said there is no bus. Have breakfast first. Yes, Mom. Call after you had breakfast. Yes, come in. - Hello. - Hello. Everyone is here. Yes, no transport is available due to yesterday's snowfall. Really? The house feels like a real home with all of you. Kim Su-hyeon! Long time no see. Hello. I was late because of the snow. Are you well? As always. Let me see... You have one more year at school? Yes. Pass the teacher certification exam. That will make your parents happy. Yes, I should. Good morning. I couldn't say hello yesterday. Thank you for taking care of us. We are not strangers. I owe you that much. Join us if you didn't have breakfast yet. I had breakfast. Everyone eat. Don't let me interrupt. About the house moving... Can you change the date? The new teacher couple seems to be in a hurry to move in. Kim, if you can't, don't worry. No, it's okay. I'm sorry. I was the one to engage them for the job. They asked me and I couldn't say no. But don't hurry too much. All right. Thank you. Bring your family to the gathering later. Gathering? I told you about the appreciation banquet, Kim. Isn't everyone busy? My family has to go back this evening. That's not right. You should celebrate since everyone is here. I should get going now. Sit down and have your breakfast. Kim, I will see you later. Goodbye. Take care. Since when is he a vice principal? Who does he think he is to call you 'Kim', 'Kim'? Father, what are you doing? I am tidying up some things. Do you need help? No, it's okay. I can manage. What? He is moving some things by himself. Hurry. What is he doing? Go and help him. It's cold. Take this. Where are you going? Let me put on my shoes. Good luck. What are you doing? I'm just sorting things. Do you want to move that? - No, leave it. I can do it. - Let me do it. It's okay. I will carry it. It's heavy. Are you going to throw this out? No, I'm taking it. Where? Just move it outside. Leave that. I'll carry it. No, leave it. Let me do it. Where are we? We are in Yong-hwa dong. No, I mean... Give it to me. - It's fine. - Let me do it, give it to me. Let's go, if we are finished. Let me catch some breath. Warm yourself up. It looks like you are really going to get divorced. The road used to be rough. It took an hour and a half to get here. But with the new road, it's much easier. And as for the house, the rafters are solid. If I repair the roof and ceiling, it will be fine. It will look like a new house if I paint the outside walls. Can't you just keep on living like you have? I'm going to have a little vegetable garden on the front yard. I will grow everything with my own hands. Why now after all these years? I'm sorry. Anyway, you're getting a house for me, right? I'm going to tell Ji-young that. Why are you going on about a house lately? And didn't you say her parents will provide the house? Now, they're telling us to get it? No, that's not it. Do you want your son to be discouraged? Come on. Huh? I will give you a shoulder massage. Hey, it's creepy. Mom. Pass the exam first and then get married. Why are you in such a hurry? I will take care of it so stop talking. - I have a headache. - Mom... No, that's not right. You should take care of it yourself. Sorry? You can't ask for money as if it's your right. Am I wrong? Why are you saying that? That's how me and your brother started, by ourselves. No, I mean... We started on our own... Stop, stop! I'll take care of it. Why... I told you I will take care of it. Stop pestering me. Okay. Then, help us too. What? There is a good spot in our neighborhood. So I'm planning to open a nail shop. Do you have to ask me for money now? I'm sorry but it's urgent. We need to make a fast decision. Am I a bank? Does money pop up on a magic word? Family shouldn't borrow or lend money among each other. It causes nothing but trouble. Su-hyeon's case is different. You will know when you are older. You have never liked me. I know you told Dong-wook to date a teacher when we started going out. But I tried my best to please you. We were going to pay back with interest. We were going to sign the contract under Dong-wook's name. But... Hye-jeong. Is there more you want to say? The kettle is running! I'll try to push. Let me try. Step on it on the count of three. One, two, three. Where have you been? Where did you go? Where is Hye-jeong? I don't know. She went out. Where have you been? Some place. What place? Why didn't you take me? I'll let you know later. Why can't you say? Is it something I shouldn't know? Let's talk later. Did something happen? Why didn't you answer the phone? There was a reason. Why is your family treating me like that? What now? What now? Do you think I'm making things up? Let's go inside. Did you talk to Sung-keun? What does he say? I don't know. Let's talk later. You don't know? What did he say? Later. Talk later. - Are you okay? - Did you just push me? Did you push me? This is exactly why your family is treating me like I'm nothing. See you later. Do you have enough vitamins at home? Let me know if you need any. We have a new brand. I will send some. What are you doing? Is there anything you need? Aren't you hungry? I'm okay. Would you like some fruits? Shall we go out? Okay. What kind of appreciation banquet is this? There are hardly any people. Yeah... Maybe it's better like this... Anyway, don't drink too much. Okay. Hello. Attention, please! Unfortunately, due to the weather, not many of the alumni could be here. This is an appreciation banquet for our teacher Mr. Kim. I, Park Chang-seok, as the president of the alumni association, would like to proceed and present a plate of appreciation. Come on. Give us a round of applause. Pass me that. Yes. Here. Mr. Kim, please stand up. Come on. Stand up. Let's go the center. Yes. I will now proceed with the presentation ceremony. Mr. Kim Sung-keun. You have faithfully served your duty and educated many students with a strong sense of duty and spirit of sacrifice. Thereby, we present you this plaque of gratitude. 13th February, 2014, Cheorwon Technical High School, President of the Alumni Association, Park Chang-seok. Applause. We should take a commemorative photo. We should. Yes, yes. Did you bring the camera? Here. What's that? Where is the DSLR? We had some issue at the base. Sorry, let's use this. Take me and Mr. Kim together. Mr. Kim, ready? One, two, three. Hey, is it good? Yes, it's good. Look. Mr. Kim! Wait. You should take one more with the vice principal. Mr. Kim. Let's do that. Let's finish this. Mr. Kim, one more. Yes. Ready, Mr. Kim, smile. Smile, one, two, three. Since we are all up, let's all take a picture together. Mr. Kim's sons, stand up. I said, let's end it. No, let's take one more. Let's take a picture. Let's just take one more. Photos last. Yes. Yes, Kim. Come on. Take a picture. Okay. Here. On the count of three. One, two, three. Thank you. Enjoy your meal. Oh, my! Does that make the soup taste better? It's just a habit. It seems to take the bad smell away. Everyone has a different taste. Pass me the salt. Here. It's too hot! Too hot! Drink some water. I got burned in my mouth. Why is this so salty? She should have told me it already had salt in it. I guess I'm to blame for expecting anything at all from this country town. Hey! Can't you hear me? I'm talking to you. Mother, calm down. Calm down? Am I being absurd? Why not tell me before? Yes... Why stab me in the back... What did I do wrong? What did I do to deserve this? What did I do? I know. It's wrong. I'm doing my best... All of you ignore what I say, do whatever you want... What am I to do? What am I...? Would you like some water? Of course. Kim would have made a great principal. Speaking of which, you were too indifferent to worldly success. All you cared about was students. Isn't that why you are where you are now? The past is the past. Mr. Kim, come and work for the Regional Development Council. I will arrange an advisor position at the council. Mr. Kim. Do you know how much comfort I get from just knowing you are in Cheorwon? Park Chang-seok, the dimwit has become the president of the alumni association, and now the head of Regional Development Council! I will oust those birds that come and go every four years, and I will be county commissioner. Mr. Kim, you can help me. That's not going to happen. What? My dad, he is not going to stay here. He is going to Chuncheon with us. Su-hyeon, you... You shouldn't. Think of it as following the path of your parents... Try harder... Huh? Like your mother... You have to... Try hard. What? You the eldest son? What do you do? I work for a pharmaceutical company. Pharmaceutical company? Ah, pharmaceutical... researcher? I'm in sales. Sales? Sales person! If you're a salesperson, you must know how to entertain Tonight's the time to entertain yourself. Here. No Drink. When an older person gives, you must always take. No. I drank too much. We should go now. He says he doesn't want it. Give me some. You're not going anywhere. This is just the beginning of the evening. - Mr. Kim! - Su-hyeon, let's go. Let me pour you one more, Mr. Kim. You can drink one more. Right, Mr. Kim? Please stop, Let me go. Let me go! Did you push me? Huh? - You pushed me? - Let go. What do you think you're doing? What did I do? Do you know who I am? Aren't you pushing it too far? What? We are leaving. What a fantastic duo. I've treated with you respect... This is supposed to be a banquet for my dad! So what? Hey, be quiet. You think you're better off? Why don't you show some respect? We're leaving. Where did you learn your manners! Hey. Let's get out and talk. What did I do? What are you doing in front of Mr. Kim? What? Mr. Kim, you're up. Mr. Kim. Get your head on straight, you! Father, stand up. Try to stand up, father. Su-hyeon, help him. Su-hyeon, help us out. Come on. Father. Mother, aren't those our guys? Just leave them. Ah... I left the appreciation plate! Leave it. Let's go. Let's call someone. Your father is a mechanics major. He might be able to fix it. But how do we wash? We will boil some water. Mom, get up. Mom, this is really good. Huh? No? Father, what did you put in this? Nothing. I used to make this to chase hangovers. It's been a while since I made it. I'm not sure if you like it. It is very good. Really. Why don't you have some? Mom, there. Mom, was this taken inside the hall? Yes. You look good. No, you don't mean that... I have so many wrinkles. I should be in the picture, too. Shall we take a picture? Let's take a picture. Hye-jeong. Let's take one, father. I'm okay. Come on. I haven't even washed my face. Come over to this side. I'll get going. Take care. Bye, dad. Travel safely. Mother, take care. What is it? Potatoes. Your father gave.
