The supernatural. It's our word for shit we don't understand. I was like you once... A skeptic... But now my eyes are open. But like so many answers... It just leads to more questions. Are the good rewarded in the next life? Are the wicked punished? Is there anything after this? Fucked if I know. Guess I'm about to find out. Body of a third girl has been found in Snowdonia National Park... The police are still no closer to discovering the identity... Six a.m. when hikers came across the remains of 23 year old Grace May... Detectives are working around the clock in the Snowdonia area... Here in this part of Snowdonia, police have discovered another body of a young woman. So far there's no official comment from the police, but it's thought that this could be another victim of the Wedlock Killer. Known for his savage and brutal attacks, each victim has their wedding finger cut off with bolt cutters. This mysterious killer has claimed five lives in as many months. With me today is Officer Freeman from the North Wales Police. Officer Freeman, could this be the work of the Wedlock Killer? I'm afraid I'm not able to confirm or deny that it is the Wedlock Killer at this time. I'm not at liberty to comment on the specific circumstances of the victim's death, until we've had a chance to complete.. Hello? Dad? Oh, my God... Jesus. It's you. He'll be back any second. You can't... Please don't hurt me! Hi, this is Duncan Slater, calling for Laurie Wolf about the presenter job at Cruise Radio. We got your demo tape. We didn't realize you were actually gonna send it on tape. Nice touch, very retro. There's some good stuff on there... Listen, if it was up to me you'd be heading up our new breakfast show, but it hasn't worked out this time. Maybe if.. Message deleted. Hi there, Maggie from Prestige here. I really like your showreel, it's so funny. Sorry though, a bit edgy for our listeners. Have you tried Cruise? They'll love you over.. Message deleted. Hiya, its Ben. Obviously... So, the final show. End of an era and all that. Please try and be on time tonight. Some of us would actually like.. Message deleted. What a perfect setting for a spine-tingling ghost story. Marek! Turn down the TV. Actually this is a ghost story... But one with a difference... One you must pay strict attention to. Every Halloween, Eleanor the Ghost rises from her grave to meet her friends. Marek, it's too loud, sweetie. Together, they will go about their ghostly business... Medicine time. Here you go. But this year, something was different. This year... It's Saturday, Miss Komisarczyk. Just one more day. That's all I need. You've already used up all the bank's good will. Just another 24 hours. What difference does a day make? Okay... The TV for starters. You silly ghost, you've missed it by a day.. Hiya. Hi. It's not the best time right now. Oh. Everything all right? Yeah, just... Never mind. Well, you look lovely. I suppose you are going out with him again, are you? What can I say? He's a real person, not just a face on a screen. I'm real. I've only got your word for that. It was you who said it would be a bad idea to meet up. I'm full of bad ideas. Anyway, it's the last show tonight. Remember you'll need an old analogue radio. Okay, I will try, But I'm not promising anything. You'll miss my technical expertise. Is that bitch still presenting? That bitch is the best in the North Wales area. Not exactly a claim to fame. I just wouldn't know what to say to her if I ever met her. Well, I wouldn't hold your breath there. Anyway, look, just promise me you'll text me.. Hi. Who's that? No one. Looked like a handsome no one to me. Just an online friend. You should to be careful who you make friends with online. Bunch of bloody freaks out there. Well, I guess that's goodbye then. Where's your TV? He watches too much anyway. Not everyone has something to fall back on. I built that PR company up from nothing. It's not my fault I'm a success. Sorry... I'm just... In a corner. Hey... Hey. Tonight's gonna change all that. I need to tell you something. I'm not sure I can do that. Okay. Okay. I get it. Maybe your situation's not that bad. No, no, it's not that. I just... I don't know if I'm capable. When the shit hits the fan... You'd be amazed of what human beings are capable of. Incredible stuff. Not me. We'll see. You think I'm incredible? I think you're okay. Well, um... I'll see you later, yeah? And... Don't forget the stuff on that list. Yeah. Sorry. Come in. How is our little prince this evening? Living room. Cartoons again? Hope he's off before my soaps start. Um... Yeah, about that... Um... Oh. I always did prefer the radio. Ooh! You going away For a week? No, it's just some stuff I need to take. I thought you were gonna watch your friend record a radio show. Where's the Jag? It's in the garage. Had to get the bus here. Let's just get started, yeah? We are really going to do this? You make it sound so ominous. Such a good girl, aren't you? I just don't understand why you can't ask him for the money, or take him to court. You've met loads of footballers. You know what they're like. I have never done anything like this before. Shit, you're gonna to sit on your arse for 10 minutes. You're turning it into Ocean's Eleven. But what happens when this guy realizes that you're try.. Kate, Kate. You know how much money he earns a week. 40 grand's like Monopoly money to him. Besides, it's not like we're stealing. He owes me this. What am I looking for? The middle of nowhere. And yet you felt like you needed a look-out? Okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. There's this one old farmer might show up, right? The fields around the house are owned by this farmer. Right? He's a busy bastard. He's harmless but he owns the private road. So if he shows up, Just get rid of him... Pronto. Think of something. Earn your money. T-tell him his sheep have escaped, or... There's a fox, That's just stupid. Think of something better. Where's the torch? What the fuck are they? Survival glow sticks. Army issue. No batteries needed. Just snap them and go. That's fucking genius. Yeah. Except how do I turn them off... In case I don't wanna be seen? I don't remember putting shit-old radio on the list. That's just in case I get bored. What's wrong with that one? It's broken. Stop worryin'. Okay, okay, stop here. Where? Just here. Just here. Stop. Now what? Now we wait. Oh, come on, come on... It's time to get that Friday feeling on JAB and howl at the moon with Laurie Wolf. Welcome, Cub Pack. It's me, Laurie Wolf. As regular listeners of the show will know, this is our last night on air. It's all been centralized, folks. No longer do you have to be bored by your local news, community and issues, you can find out what's going on in the real world, like London or Cardiff. I have... A list of songs approved by the station... But I'm sure you've heard them all before. After six years of playing shit other people want me to play, I'm going to spend just one night playing music I want to listen to, because you know... I am a DJ. Stick with me if you dare. Yeah, lovely. Can we maybe... Tone the language down? Maybe? Please? Please?! We're on delay! Just cut it out, genius. We are taping this, aren't we? Haven't used tape for 20 years, but... Yeah. Okay. Game time. Can you hold those? What they have a big dog, or something? Didn't you say Marek needs an operation, or something? Yeah. So just sit there, do nothing, listen to your piece of shit radio, and count to 20,000 in your head. I'll be back before you can blink, and have a bag full of something better than fucking glow sticks. Hi, it's Janet. Hi. Put him on. Okay. It's your mum. Hi, sweetie. Bed time now. I want you to go to sleep, and I want you to think about nice things. Because... Because tomorrow, when you wake up... Things are going to be different for us. We just need to be strong. We'll get through this. Just one more night, and... We can start all over again. Okay? Oh, don't worry. He's in good hands. I know. Thanks, Janet. Yep, we're on air, actually, so... Shall I call back later? Nope, you've got 'til the end of the track. You listening? Yeah! Great show so far. We've only been on 60 seconds. But thanks. Is this on the CD you made me? Yes. Yes, it is. Did you like it? Yeah. Got some good stuff on it. Bollocks. It's got some great stuff on it. Track Two is amazeballs. Anyway, what's up? Why do you say that? Because you called me. Something's definitely up. Um... Here's an idea. Why don't you come here? I'm busy. Whatever it is, Just walk away. Come on, we can have our own little mini party here. We're gonna have a psychic on. Should be fun. She's really good. Maybe. Oh, gotta go. Song's ending. Busy, busy. Bye. It's just after nine p.m. On the 16th of September, And I can already tell you that tomorrow is going to suck... Hard. So why not stay up all night and forget about tomorrow altogether? God, I'm such a mess. What's got you so excited? Uh... She's here. Careful. Don't wanna give her the wrong idea. Hi! Uh... Ciao. Ciao. Can you help me with my stuff? Of course. Thank you. I have to say I'm a massive fan. I've got all your books. Yeah? I'll sign both of them If you like. Oh, watch your step up here. This place can be a bit of a death trap. Building's a bit rickety. Used to be a World War Two communications outpost. I hope that doesn't put you off, you being Italian and all. Ah, no, don't worry. My father was partigiano. Partigiano? Yes, partigiano against Mussolini. Oh, thank God for that. This way. Okay. So, you actually talk to the dead and stuff? Amongst other talents. So have you ever spoken to anyone famous, like, um... Marilyn Monroe or Genghis Kahn or someone like that? No. The afterlife... It's not like chat show. Oh... Well, that's a pity, isn't it? Watch your step right there. So, this is where the magic happens. Have you fixed the antenna? We don't want it crapping up in the middle of our triumphant last show. Yep. Did it before you arrived. Oh, you're on the ball. I know. Stay tuned, because later we have "Carla the Psychic". She's going to be telling us what our futures have in store for us. Spoiler alert: I don't have one. Shit. Great. Shit. What are you doing stuck out here in the middle of the night, huh? You must be freezing. My boyfriend, he will be back in a minute. You here for Sarah? Sarah? My daughter, 'cause she's not here. 'Course all I get it a Post-it Note on the fridge saying she'll be away for a week. Gone to see Becky.. I don't know here. Sorry. Ah. Anyway, you shouldn't be out here on your own in the middle of the night. You don't watch the news, no? He's gone for petrol. He won't be long. When'll he be back? Sorry, have we done something wrong? Well, you're parked on my property. We were lost... Well... I'll tell you what. Why don't you get in my truck and we'll go look for him? He can't have gone far. He won't be long. You must be busy. I've got plenty of petrol back at the farm. You're not trying to get rid of me, are you? No, of course not. Good. I'll just stay here and... Keep you company. Okay. Until he gets back. How's it going? Peachy. Ready to break out the joss sticks and start chanting. All right, one: You know how I feel about fur. Can we remove the stoat from the work area please? And two: Can you try and keep an open mind, for me, today, please? Hey, I'm the rational one. This was your idea. Excuse me if I can't ignore the last 200 years of science and philosophy. You know she's a giant in her field, don't you? Too bad her field is filled with horse shit. Try and have a bit of respect, will you? Respect? Respect is for doctors, teachers and charity workers, not for charlatans preying on the emotionally unstable. I'm not emotionally unstable. That's a matter of opinion. Let's just say I represent the sensible, sane, rational listeners, and you represent... The rest of the freaks. Thanks. Hey! You can have them back at the end of the show. Cold night to be out. I'm okay. He's not coming back, you know. There isn't a petrol station or village... For miles 'round here. Looks like you're stuck with me. He... Said he would be right back. I think we both know that's a lie. I think it'll be best if you came to mine. Get in the car. Really, I think I should be here when he gets back. Well, phone him. No signal. Huh. Not your lucky day, is it? Come on. I-I can't, I... I'm sorry. I-I didn't realize. It's fine. I can go to the farm and get some petrol. Really. It's not a problem. Ah, this is him now. I thought you couldn't get a signal. I guess it's in and out. Hi darling. Have you found the petrol station? What are you talking about? You have? Fantastic! Are you on your way back? Is someone there? Uh-huh, yeah, I have been befriended by some kind man. It's okay. Shit. Get rid of him. Yep. I will. I haven't got the money yet. Get fucking rid of him now. He says thanks for looking after me. Guess I better be on my way. Thank you so much. You've come out of your way for me. Oh, not really. I just live there. Only house 'round here For miles. There? Well, I hope it all works out okay. But.. W-wait. Kate. Kate! Nick has something to say. My boyfriend says that there's a fence down, uh... Three miles from here. Sheep everywhere. Where? Just a few miles over that hill. That's Bryn William's land. Kate. He said it's quite bad. Um, a car ran over a few and killed them. I suppose I can go and have a look. I'm here anyway. He'd do the same for me. Thanks for your help. Okay, mind explaining what the fuck is going on? What are you talking about? Whose house is it that you're in? Sweetheart, I told you. Stop lying to me! I'm not. Stop overreacting. I'm nearly done. I'll see you soon, okay? Can I pop these on your ears? No, thanks. Okay. You're listening to JAB Radio, sound of Snowdonia. I'm very excited to introduce the... Exotic Carla, who's travelled over five miles from Bangor to join us tonight. She's going to predict our futures. I'm guessing you are not a believer. No! Fascinated. I really think... You're the most exciting guest we've got on tonight. Lots of people have a problem with what I do. I'm often accused of exploiting the vulnerable. But it's not about money, but consciousness. The ability to tune into your environment. So, tune into here. Us, now. For you, Ben... I see much responsibility. And Laurie, for you it's... It's harder to see. It's misty. (Whispers) I can sense a dark presence. A voice crying in the darkness. In the darkness. I'm not sure where... But the voice is reaching out to us. Something terrible has happened. So... Just to re-cap... Something terrible is happening somewhere in the world right now. Can't be sure where. Sorry we can't be more specific. Hello? Is anyone there? Oh, fuck. Hi, you've got the voicemail of Nick Keller. I can't take your call right now, but if you leave me a message I'll call you back. Shit. You're fucking kidding me! Come on. Hi, you've got the voicemail of Nick Keller. I can't take your call right now, but if you leave.. Come on. It's the Midnight Hour Show. JAB Radio. That was for those of you still with us at this hour. We're half way through the night. So keep drinking that extra strength coffee and follow us until dawn. It's our final ever show, so it's your last chance to hear some decent music on these airwaves. Speaking of which, now it's time for a blast from the past. ♪ I held you close ♪ I let you know ♪ All my secrets I'm very excited to introduce the exotic Carla... She is always like this? Oh no. Normally we have to be a little more... Safe. I guess she thinks she's got nothing to lose. What are you doing? There is a light delay on the show. Gives me the opportunity to fade out quick if... Madam in there swears... Or a quest explodes. Crying in the darkness. (Ghostly voice) Wait a moment. Go back. Okay. A voice crying in the darkness. (Ghostly voice) There? Again. A voice crying in the darkness. (Ghostly voice) There. Interference or something. Ancora. Again. A voice crying in the darkness. (Ghostly voice) What does that sound like to you? Tell you what. Let me clean that up a bit. So, what's her problem? Oh, she's not that bad really. I didn't like to say on air when I was reading her but, I saw... A lot of pain in her past. Oh, the singer on this track now. Yeah? That's her. ♪ I won't cry She's got a great voice. Mm-hm. What happened? Some crazy ex. Years ago now. She gave up her career for him, was having his kid, he was less than thrilled by the news. He wanted her to get an abortion? No, no, he, um... Stuck an ice pick in her neck and threw her down a flight of stairs. She was lucky. Well, no, not really, but, um... She survived. She lost her baby? Mm-hm. Took her a whole year to relearn how to speak... But she'll never sing again. But she's okay. He's doing a life stretch in Dartmoor. Yeah... (Ghostly voice) What is that? ♪ I won't cry ♪ I won't ask why ♪ Then you'd still be mine Hi, you've got the voicemail of Nick Keller. I can't take your call right now, but if you leave me a mess.. Hello? Nick, stop messing around and get in the car. Nick. Let's get out of here. Nick. Nick! What the fuck? Laurie, we need you in here now. Right, listen. This is gonna sound crazy. Thrill me. Right. You know that piece you just did with Carla? Yeah. Right. There was something weird. Okay? Carla spotted it. So I run it through the computer, put it into Sound Factory, filtered out the distortion. So I'm filtering, and filtering, and filtering.. Yeah, I get the idea. Anyway, blah, blah, blah, technical shit, and we get... This. Voice crying in the darkness... Oh, God. Jesus... It's you. He'll be back any minute. Please... Don't hurt me. Please... Don't hurt me. You're just picking up a radio play from another channel, or kids playing with an old CB. No, I eliminated all that. This stuff was broadcast... If you can call it that... From here. How is that possible? It's not. So, what do you want me to do about it? We think we can make contact. Make contact? With the Beyond. We've got this idea. Right? It's called EVP. Electronic Voice Phenomena. You create, like, a static hole, and the voice of an entity fills that hole.. I've lost you haven't I? Yeah. You lost me at having your hole filled with entities. It's possible, but not for much longer. In three hours time, the station turns over to digital, and EVP only works with analogue static. It's our only chance. This is how you want me to go out? With you two wailing and moaning like a pair of specters over the air waves. Personally... I'd rather play a Steps album. It's never been done live. Plus it would really piss off the channel heads. Okay, you've got ten minutes after the news break at two a.m., but the first time someone starts rattling the table, I'm pulling the plug. Whey! Are you going to tell me what the fuck is going on? Kate, is that you? Baby, what's wrong? You're scaring me. Here. He's here now. What? What's wrong? Are you okay? Please, Kate. I need you. Nick! Nick, are you okay? Nick! Nick! Oh, my God. Jesus, it's you. He'll be back any second. Please don't hurt me. Get away! It's the midnight hour show with Laurie Wolf on JAB. Welcome back, Cub Pack. Hope you enjoyed the last ever local news broadcast from this station. Well, from a last time here to a first time... Well... Anywhere... Visiting psychic Carla Zazza has managed to convince me that we have a ghost in the machine here at JAB Radio, and she's the one to bust it... Right? That's not really what I do. So tell us, what exactly is it that you do? I can contact spirits of the departed. Sometimes they have messages or... Words of comfort for those left behind. For a fee, I'm guessing... A ghost... A ghost is like an echo. What you're hearing or seeing... Is being bounced back at you from the past. Very often a ghost is caused by... A violent and unnatural death. Spirits nearly always have some... Unfinished business. Something that keep their energy from moving on. And time, time is meaningless in the spirit realm. Sometimes a spirit can even give us some information about the future. So tell us what you have in store for us tonight. We believe... That an entity has made contact with the radio station. It's pretty common that freakish entities to make contact with us here every night. Only we call it... A "Phone in". So what now? Hold hands and sing? Maybe if you shut up and listen instead of talking over everything I say we can start. If that's the way you wanna play it... Baby, are you here? Nick? Great radio, genius. Can the spirit who tried to contact us... Hear me? Can the spirit who tried to contact us... Hear me? Does the spirit who tried to contact us... Have a message? Come to us. Tell us. Come to us. Can the spirit who tried to contact us... Hear me? Does the spirit who tried to contact us... Have a message? Can the spirit who tried to contact us... Hear me? ominous music ♪] It's here. It's here. It's here. What have you done?! Do you have a message? A message? (Distorted voice) I'm getting something. Where am I? (Italian) Are you lost? Who are you? Are you lost? Come to us. Come. What's your name? Your name? Sarah. Sarah. Is this your name? Sarah? Sarah... We want to help you. What has happened to you? What's happened to you? Can-can we help? Come to us. Come to us. Um, we'd like to apologize to all our listeners everywhere For that slight technical hitch. Just send me the laundry bill for your underwear. You sound like you are in great pain, Sarah. Can-can we help? Can we help you, Sarah? Please... Please... What are you doing? I am a good man. I always do what I think is right. Please... I don't know what's happening. But hear this... If you talk... If you so much as whisper... I'll answer the voice in my heart. The one that tell me to cut your tongue out. You have taken everything from me. Everything! I wanted... To ask you... Why... Did you do it? Why did you kill her? I don't know what you think I've done! Liar! You see? See what you made me do? Please... I'm sorry... I'm so sorry. Was it... At least quick? When you killed her? When you killed my daughter? I won't be quick. I'll make you suffer. Where are you from? The Nant Pass. Below the White Hills. Where's that? There's nothing there. Just the odd farm. Listen, Sarah... Are you from a farm? A farm in that area? Who... Did this to you? Him. Him? My finger... He took... My finger. Why... Would he do this? Wedlock Killer. (Italian) Ask her if she knows who killed her. Listen. Focus on me. Focus on my voice. An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye. Hm? An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye. An eye for an eye. She's here... That girl is here. It's a trick... She's fooling with you. Please. Please just listen to me! I don't know what's happening! You have to believe me. Please! Please... Please... I can't do this. You lucky bastard. I can't do this. Gonna call the police. Tell 'em I found the killer. Huh? They can sort you out. No! No! Sarah... Sarah, focus on me... On my voice. He's dead! He... He's dead! Marek? Oh, my! Are you okay? Tell them... Who killed me. Do you know? Know? Know what? I don't know anything! I didn't think it would be you. Look at me. Do you know me? How? How could it be you? No. Come on, come on. Hello? Kate? Kate? I can't hear you this end. Are you okay? Look... It's Marek. He-he's, uh... He's had a... Well, I don't know... He's not himself. I'm bringing him to you. I'll be at the radio station in about 15 minutes, okay? Ring me if you get the chance. Don't touch him. Please. Leave my so alone. I want you to see... I want you to see what I'll do to him. You're sick! Yes. Well, you better kill me now, Because if I get out of this I'm going to fucking kill you. You stay here. I will bring you your son... And you will watch him die. You leave me here... And I'm going to fucking hunt for you, You fucking freak! You stay here. No! No! No! No! No! No, no, no! No! No, please! Please, please! Stop. Please. Help me, please. She's gone. We've lost her. Wait. It's not over yet here. Wait. One person knows. Who? Who knows? At my house. Tied up. Someone is tied up At your house? She's in danger. Who is this person? Who? Who knows? No. Wait! We are not finished! Power's on, but I got nothing. She's gone. Nick? Nick! Who did this to you? Don't know. I don't know. He was wearin' a mask. He was in a mask. Whose house is this? And don't say a fucking footballer. Who lives here? I did... I did. It's my... Family home. Then why the fuck are we trying to rob it? There's no jag. There's no-no company. There's no money. Dad has all the money. Dad has all the money. He's giving it to her. To Sarah? My sister... She's my sister. Why didn't you say so? I didn't want you to know I was... Stealing from my family. Just... Just... Want you to like me. I want you... To like me. Take the money... Take the money. I need to get you to a hospital. Take the money... Take Marek... And go somewhere new. Take... Just take... No! No! No! It's okay, cariad. We're nearly there. Great. Fucking genius! Whoa. That was... Amazing. It's a shame we got cut off. You two... Are sick. You nearly had me. We did it. We actually made contact. This is over. This stupid fucking experiment of yours ends now. What we did was incredible! Then maybe you can write another book about it, that's if you have enough crayons. I'm gonna crack on. (Italian) What is wrong? You! This whole thing! Do you have any idea what it's like to have someone taken away from you? A life? Of course. You can't... Otherwise why would you spend your time trying to convince people that there is anything beyond this, other than an infinite test signal? For precisely that reason. So what would my child say to me, then? Hm? My unborn child? Would he have a message? Because he never learned to talk. So how exactly does this work? I'm really sorry for your loss. I don't need your sympathy! I need reality. Existence just is a sliver of light between two chasms of darkness. I don't believe that. We have just proved it. No, all you have proved was how good you are at manipulating people. And the Wedlock Killer? That's just in poor fucking taste. Real people are dealing with that, right now. He's not Jack the Ripper or killer of the week on Columbo. He's out there now doing God knows what. And you're trading on his infamy. We'll have to agree to disagree. Yeah. I'm going to have a cigarette. You can smoke in here. I need a break from her shit. Yeah, you and Aleister Crowley in there have pretty much killed my final show! Maybe that's what we should be trying to contact from beyond the grave: My career! Are you there, career? Come on! Fuck! Balls! Antenna's gone tits up again! It's nearly the end. Don't you want THX quality sound for the end of the show? Not particularly. Five minutes. You've got three. I'm gonna go in first, okay? You wait here. Okay, okay. We'll go together. Marek? Marek? Marek? Oh, my God! Marek! It's the Midnight Hour Show with Laurie Wolf on JAB. Just 20 minutes until sunrise. That's nearly it for our last night, folks. But it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it? We brought you laughs... Tears... And voices from beyond the grave. Lets see if they can do that on the London networks without stopping the un-dead to advertise life insurance every five minutes. Nearly time to sign off forever... But still room for a few more tunes. Yes folks, if you've made it through the night then... Sleep tight. If you're an early riser then you're waking up to what experts are already calling Saturday the 17th of September. Sometimes a spirit can even give us some information about the future. It's called a delay. Oh, my God. Ben, thank God! Oh! We use it to check content. Make sure there is no swearing or anything like that. Of course, to the audience... It sounds live, but in reality... It was last night. Great really, I mean... Pop out for a pint. Be in two places at once. What have you done to Marek? Where is my son? Well, first thing's first. You should listen to the end of the show. It's really good. I think... This is my favorite bit. Well... So long... Auf Wiedersehen... Sayonara... Ciao, bella. It's goodbye from me, Laurie Wolf... And my partners in crime, Ben the technician... And psychic, Carla Zazza. Saying goodbye for the final time. See you crazy kids on the other side... Well... That, all things considered, was a load of old shit. I wanted to go out on top. Right... Priorities. Fucking crisps. Earth to Ben! Jackpot. Sweets. If anyone's listening, I'm at the JAB Radio Station. Call the police and send them here! Why have you gotta go poking about? Oh, Jesus fuck, Ben! You shouldn't have seen them. Oh, my God! It's you! It's been me for years, Laurie. Right at your side. You know, first, I wanted to kill you. Nearly did... But when you recovered... I couldn't resist. This wasn't you... It was.. Your idiot boyfriend? No, he just took the fall. I mean... All this time... I was there... With you. And you never once suspected. That as more exciting than killing you. But now... Oh, go on, you fucking prick! I get to do that too. Oh, my God. I'm sad you had to look in that cupboard. Who knows how long we could have kept this dance going? Fuck... You. Maybe if you had. Jesus Christ, you killed her! Oh, I killed everyone. Including Carla the psychic. I mean... She was shit. She should've seen that coming, really. But the voices... The voices from beyond that grave that could... Predict the future... That, I couldn't explain. One person knows. We are not finished! She's gone. And I had to know. I had to know who it would be at Sarah's house. I never thought it would be you. And Sarah? Please don't hurt me. Oh, we met on the internet. Met them all on the internet. Hiya. Amazing, really. I mean... You can be anybody. Anybody you want. Please... I mean, that's how we met, isn't it? What have you done to my son? Where is he? If you've hurt him.. Of course I haven't hurt him. Don't be silly. Promised you, didn't I? I'd kill him in front of you. Fuck! Marek? Marek? Behind the door... He's behind the door! Oh, my God. Oh, you're okay. You're okay. Everything will be okay. We-we have to get you out of here. What? What is this? Oh, no. No, no! No! No, no! He's coming... I need to get something from the car to cut this, but I will be back. I promise I'll come back. Look at me. I promise I'll come back. You just have to be quiet for Mommy, okay? You just have to be very quiet. Mommy loves you. Let's not forget the finger. Aah! Fuck! Get away! Fucker! Get away, you fucker! No! No! No! Now you fucking burn. I wanna smell your insides cook. I told you I was going to fucking kill you. The supernatural. It's our word for shit we don't understand. See? Mommy came back. I promised you I'm gonna come back for you. I was like you once... A skeptic... But now my eyes are open. But like so many answers... It just leads to more questions. Are the good rewarded in the next life? Are the wicked punished? Is there anything after this? Fucked if I know. Guess I'm about to find out.
