How old do you think Greta is? Twenty seven... perhaps twenty eight. Well, well... You're both cold sober! How can you have fun? After this drink I must go home. Sorry I forgot about your sister's death. How thoughtless of me. Not at all. Let's say goodnight to Uta. This court is now in session. Judge Dahlberg presiding. Bring in the prisoner. You're accused of being a virgin. How do you plead? Guilty... of course! Is there any reason why sentence should be suspended? All: No... no! Plaintiff Gunnar Kraal will carry out the sentence. The execution will be public... right here... Prepare the prisoner for the execution. Fresh... I baked them this afternoon. I'm sorry. Astrid was so lovely. Who will care for her daughter Inga? She'll live here with us. It'll be nice to have a young girl in the house. It's not that simple. She's only seventeen. Besides, we're running out of money. I've only a few thousand left. A girl of seventeen needs money, too. Not as much as older girls... Older girls with young... ...lovers. Face up to it, Greta. You can't afford him. But he needs someone. He needs someone he can... lean on. While he's waiting to be published. But does he need a new sports car while he's waiting? Hey. I bribed the doorman. He let me slip in. I know you don't approve of bribery. I forgot you're an intellectual. A writer. Not a very successful writer. Shall we make love? I'm very good at it - they say. I certainly believe that. Is it Greta? Are you sure? Okay... I'll get you yet. In a weak moment. You're paying his rent... you're giving him an allowance. I'm also paying your salary. And I'm a servant with a big mouth. I have invested in Karl. It's an investment that will pay off in dividends, when he is published. Sure... when and if... How much longer can you keep up pretending? Pretending? Yes, about your money... your age. I'm thirty two years old. You'll be thirty four on your next birthday. He is barely twenty one. He's very mature for his age. He thinks you're in your twenties. Is that all you're going to eat now? I'll have coffee later. I don't know why I bother to bake. Einar Nilsson! Frida! You old goat! Old? I'm not older than you! Someone might hear you! The whole world will know that we're two old goats! Is Mrs. Johansson home? She must've gone for a swim, she was wearing her bathing suit. Where can I get a cup of coffee? Where? Right in my kitchen, of course. Even as a kid you were a girl chaser. You were a young lecher... and now you're an old lecher! You were the first girl I ever saw. Yes, I remember. You and Nils Johansson invited me to your treehouse. He climbed up first. Then you went up. And you were last, and you looked up my skirt all the way. I need a woman. An attractive well-bred woman whom I could properly take to my sister's dinner parties... ...and also afterwards... well... ...to your bedroom. Exactly. Who in hell has those qualifications? Greta. The only trouble is that I'd have very little to offer to a woman like Greta. I can't marry. I'm tied to a sick woman. The only thing I can share with someone is my wealth. But Greta does not need money. Nils left her well provided. Greta isn't as well off as you think. Really? Well, prices have gone up... And, in my opinion, she has made some bad investments. Einar! How long were you spying on me? Long enough to thoroughly enjoy it. You never answered my phone calls. I was very busy, Einar. Forgive me. Too busy to have dinner with me tonight? Sorry... I have an engagement. What about tomorrow? I'll pick you up in the afternoon. We'll go sailing or play tennis. And in the evening we'll have dinner with Sigrid and her friends. How is Sigrid? Sigrid never changes. And Hilda, your wife? Hilda is in a sanatorium. This time it is forever. That's what the psychiatrist told me. Oh, Einar, I'm so sorry! Well, what do you say? I won't take no for an answer. I'll pick you up at two o'clock. - Greta. - Hmm? I saw a nice boat today and I priced it. That 20 footer we talked about... I can get a used one for 1200 dollars. There's no problem, is there? I mean, no money problem. It'll only be a loan. You'll get it all back as soon as I sell my first story. You're not having money trouble, are you? No, Karl... No money problems whatsoever. Poor baby, all alone in the world with her mother dying so suddenly. Thank God for your Aunt Greta. I'll be all right, Berta. Aunt Greta was always so nice. And she doesn't seem to mind taking me in. Aunt Greta will open a whole new world for you. Whose house is this? It is Sigrid's... and mine. This place holds fond memories. For many years, my mother and Nils' mother would bring Nils, Sigrid and me here... ...for a month each summer. You were my husband's best friend. We didn't sleep much at night. We talked all night, every night. About what? About our future. Nils wanted to be a soldier of fortune. He became an engineer. And a damn good one too. What did you want to be? You mean in my dreams? I was going to be an explorer. I would discover exotic uncharted islands... ...and subdue barbaric warrior tribes with my iron will. And having conquered, I would surround myself... ...with lithe native maidens with long slender legs... ...and bare blossoming breasts. You see... Even when I was a child, my mind was on women. I suppose you want to go. You lived there... ...ten years. And speaking of Africa, Einar and I... ...visited Algeria five years ago. We took some great snapshots. I'd love to see them. Sigrid, not the ones with me on a bearskin. This is the album. Greta, your presence here tonight is a ray of hope for me. I do hope you're interested in Einar. I don't know what you mean by "interested." I'm very fond of him. Greta... You could save me... a great deal of anquish... ...and Einar too. Anguish? Anguish and an embarrassing situation. You see... Einar... has a propensity for young women... very young women. I'm not that young. You're in your early thirties and you don't even look that. But what is most important... Einar is interested in you. Why me? I'll be frank with you. For the past two years, Einar has been involved with... ...giggling, loudmouthed, embarrassing adolescent strumpets. They all had a talent for making Einar look like an ass. First there was that Hani Renfors. She ran away with a guitar player. Thank God. Then came Lena Helm. The last was the worst of all... a teenage lush... Dagmar Borg. Dagmar Borg? I know her. What a tart! Last time she was here... She got so drunk, she vomited on Count Klagborg. She passed out at last, but... ...not until she had informed my other guests that Einar was... ...a dirty old man who always wanted to take her to bed. Greta... Einar is not a playboy. He is a businessman. He needs a woman at his side. A woman he can be proud of... ...a woman he can introduce to his friends and business associates. A well-bred person. I know you don't need money. But I'll arrange that you get it anyway. Just be Einar's companion... his friend. Sigrid... I'm not in love with him. Being in love isn't that important. You're no doubt aware that my thinking is not strictly middle-class. Have a drink? You think this is "the weak moment" you talked about. Uti says that you had a fight with Greta. That's not true. Marvelous. But we can be friends anyway. What're you doing here? Who is that? Einar Nilsson. The publisher? He was my husband's closest friend. I spent the day with him and his sister. I have some important investments with him. I resent your seeing other men. Einar Nilsson isn't "another" man. He's a business associate. We need money, dear. I must watch my investments. Can I see you tomorrow? Pick me up at noon? I must pick up my niece at the station at two. I'll see you at noon. - Nite. -Nite. Coffee's served! Stop primping! Karl will be here any minute! Have a good time last night? I was bored stiff. You can't properly decide after one night. You must give it a try. I did... I spent the whole day with Einar. Did you go to bed? Was he good? I like him fine. As a kid, I always wondered what he'd be like. The rest of it, though, I couldn't take. You don't like Sigrid? Sigrid's all right. But I can't stand their stuffy, pompous friends and all that talk. Besides, they like opera! That's not too high a price for a regular income. Frida... ...you wouldn't understand. I was eighteen when I married Nils. At twenty I was completely fed up with discussions and concerts. No, thanks. I couldn't take any more of that. Besides... There's Karl... See you at four. - Inga Fridlund? - Yes. I'm your aunt Greta. You're as pretty as your mother. This is Karl Nistad... a very dear friend. You have taste in literature. I like the classics. I'll take them. Frida... Is Karl Greta's boyfriend? Well... sort of... What're you thinking about? Your niece... Inga. She's not very attractive. Or is she? She's not bad. I was hoping she wouldn't come between us. I mean... she would take all your time. I'll probably have to give her a little time... But you needn't worry about that. She never takes her nose out of her books. One thing, though... she has a splendid figure. I wish you'd call Einar. He phoned four times last night. We're going to need his money. See him then. I'm afraid I'll lose Karl, if I do. But I'll lose him anyway, if I don't. I need the money for the boat he wants. Inga? What's your favorite pastime? Reading. The classics... What's your favorite music? Symphonies... concerts. How about chamber music? I love it! What're your favorite subjects? Literature... and history. Take your shower; Frida will give you a massage. I think I found a solution to all our problems. Both social and economic problems... I'm sure she's still a virgin. Look at that paint, all chipped. You got to do everything yourself! Mr. Halstrom, this is my friend, Greta Johansson. We want that boat. It's 1200 dollars. Will you take a check? Yes... if it is good. It is good. Well, let's go int the office. Hello? Einar! I'm sorry, I can't. Not tonight; I'm tied up with Inga. I couldn't possibly leave her. Bring her along? Could you make it for... Thursday? Tennis? Fine. We'll both be there then. I'm sure you'll like her. Thank you, Einar. It's hard to believe my mother... ...was only two years older than you. Do you always wear miniskirts? No... not always. Don't you like miniskirts? No, they are not for me. But you have the figure for them. Hey. And how's Inga today? Fine. Strindberg's plays. Pretty heavy stuff for a sixteen year old. I'm seventeen. Too serious anyway. Well, we... we have a lot to do today. "Pretty heavy stuff for a sixteen year old." He makes me sick. I don't know how Aunt Greta can put up with him. There, there. No reason to cry. A beauty, isn't it? Only 1200 dollars! You can afford it. Don't worry, darling. You know I'll repay it all. Of course, darling. Karl? I've shopping to do for that poor child. Will you drive us... - ...to Stockholm tomorrow? - Yes, naturally. We'll have to start out early. I'll need a full day in town. Any time you like. Half past six. Middle of the night? Yeah, okay. Look at me! Can you imagine me in this? Karl... ...thank you for driving us. Look at him! Like he'd never been kissed by a girl before! Stop blowing that horn! Greta isn't here! I'll wait a while. What's the matter? I don't know. Let's go away for a while on the boat. Darling, I can't right now. There's something I must attend to. But as soon as I'm through, we'll get away for as long as you want. - Inga? - Yes, Greta? I see you're reading the books I suggested. They're very interesting. Good. You'll soon mee the authors. Frida mentions the Nilssons a lot, especially Einar. I'm sure you'll like him when you get to know him. And he'll like you. The Nilssons are for me more than friends. They... they contribute to my income. Why? They were close friends of my husband. And they like me. I'm like one of the family. And I'd like you also to become that close. They're nice. Why should they like me too? Because you're Astrid's daughter, and my niece. Did they know Mother? Greta... Were you and Mother very close? Yes. When we were young. But your father's business was mostly in Europe, so we seldom saw each other. After they divorced, I seldom saw her. Father remarried in America. Mother would sometimes show up at school on visiting days. But ususlly she was busy with other things. Greta... Do you really want me here? Of course I want you. Why do you ask? Well, you have your own troubles. We both have troubles of our own. And we'll help each other. - Have some Cognac? - Alright. I hope Sigrid opens Einar's Napoleon brandy. Shall we let Inga have a Cognac? Of course, she's a young lady. Greta... Einar and I are spending a week at the bungalow. Could you and Inga join us? Unfortunately, I can't make it. Thank you anyway. But I'm sure Inga would love it. What a beautiful ring. I just wanted to say goodnight. Goodnight. I hear you like opera. I love opera. We have tickets to the Magic Flute next Wednesday if you want to go. - You mean it? - Of course I do. Goodnight. Goodnight. I wonder what Aunt Greta's doing tonight. Aren't you coming to bed? I'm not tired. Hell! I should hope not! Come on! Stop kidding around! Get undressed! I saw you drooling at all the girls. I did not. Oh yes, you did. And yet, I'm better than any of them. Hello! Anybody home? Darling, did you have fun? It was wonderful! Thank you, Einar. Do you like bike riding? Oh yes, if I have someone to ride with. I've arranged for Uta Dahlberg and Ingrid Holmberg--they live up the road-- - ...to ride with you. - How nice of you. Thank you, Einar. And don't forget you're taking me to the opera. What energy! Was she any trouble? No, not at all. I'm sure she'll love the opera next week. I must go now. Bye, Einar. And thanks for having Inga. Goodbye. This is Uta and Ingrid. Hi! Like to ride along the shore? I'd love to. Hello? Greta darling, it is important that I speak to you as soon as possible. Certainly. When? Einar won't be in, so we'll be able to talk undisturbed. I'll come. I'll come right to the point. Einar is quite smitten with Inga. Only the blind wouldn't see it. You don't mind? That's up to Inga. Oh, come now. You control Inga, and we both know it. I need your help. I'd like, um, Inga to be... ...Einar's girl. Einar's mistress? "Constant companion" is a better phrase. Einar can make her very happy. She likes the kind of things he can give her. High quality, expensive things. We talked once before about... An arrangement? Greta, the cards are on the table. I'll put you on the company books... ...for... eight hundred a month. A thousand? A thousand. But only for so long as Inga is Einar's "constant companion." Does that mean Inga can't go out with anyone else? Einar will monopolize her time. It only means that you must prevent her from... ...getting involved with another man. Then everything is satisfactory? Sigrid... Has Einar slept with her? Let him be patient with her. She is a virgin. I'm freezing. Let's go to the barn. Good idea. Come on! Come! No, I can't. What happened? Aunt Greta... There was this boy... I almost... I wanted... Inga... It's natural for a girl to want sex. Uta... Your mother... Me... You... Go to him. But I'm going to the opera tonight. Go to him now. He's gentle. He's understanding. Let him love you. Thank you, Aunt Greta. Thank you. Einar... I know you've tickets for the opera. I thought she was with you all afternoon. Einar? Einar? I can't go to look for her. Karl's coming to pick me up. He has the car. We'll both go to look for her. We'll go away. We'll take the boat and go away. Good morning, Mrs. Johansson. Have you seen Mr. Nistad? He took the boat. He said he was going up north. He left with a lovely young chick. She was wearing just... ...shorts, and one of his sweaters. He gave me this note for you. Here. And the keys for the car over there.
