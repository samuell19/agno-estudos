Is my mother not working today? She stopped. I forgot. You must put it that way. That's enough now. Come down from there. Leave me be. Thanks. D'you think the school will take him? I don't know. He "don't vont" speak French. He can, but he "don't vont". He doesn't want. - She's not come back? - No. Luna! Can you come out? I'm not hungry! Don't you shout at me. Come on! There. They're going to score. Block him! Luna, you're not transparent! It's hopeless, forget it. Yeah, duck your head. Hopeless. l don't know if there's any water left. Keep your legs tight together. lt's cold? l've done it loads of times. You're not gonna die. You go. Stop. - lt looks higher. - See. - You okay? - Yes. Here. Got history class tomorrow? Sami? Want to go home together? Right. As you see, the stage is empty. We're going to give a classical-music concert. The 6th Symphony by Gustav Mahler. You can go and take photos, walk around the stage. And just below us, there's a huge rehearsal hall. Will we see the conductor? Rovinski? No. Some don't mind us attending rehearsals, but not him. Would you like to see him? No. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye. Hi. Mum. - You okay? - Yes. "Thousands of birds in the trees." Thousands of birds in the "treece". - ln the trees. - ln the "treece". Stop. "Thousands of flowers in the garden." What? Thousands of flowers in the garden. - Thousands of flowers in the garden. - I didn't understand a thing. Me neither. In French. "Me neither." Repeat. Do some dribbles for me? No. Come on. No. Again. Thousands of flowers... Why don't you want to? Because it's serious. Football is serious? Repeat. "Thousands of flowers in the garden." Thousands of flowers in the garden. I can't believe you don't care. We could go to the concert. He says he doesn't want me. He said it was too late to hear about it. - That's true. - What? Who waited 1 0 years to tell him. Now that he's here, you're waiting for him to go abroad? Stop bouncing that ball. When's the doctor's? At 3 o'clock. Come here. - What'll we do? - Play an ordinary match. They'll be there to watch you. Take your positions and play your game. - They'll watch? They'll decide? - They'll be looking at 400 kids. You either hang on, or there'll be nothing. We've got 2 weeks to get ready. No TV, no kebabs, no Mc Donald's. Go. Hey, Omar? Can l take the tests? Does your father agree? Well, then. The man who saw you at the match called me. He wanted to be sure you'd come. Get ready, boys. - We'll do some cardio. - When would l leave? Now. l mean when the school term starts. Will you tell your mother? I don't know. Kick off. Go. lt's still going strong. l don't know how to dismantle this. My boyfriend set it up. There's a fridge, gas hob, oven. lt's not new but it all works. We've got so many things. lf you want to keep something, just say. This is Victor, my son. - D'you remember him? - Okay? Yes. You can dismantle both. This one, you need to saw the plank and it's yours. I won't need it. Had a look at the annexe? The shed over there? No. Go on, then. l worked with him. Why are they here? There's too many things to repair. I can't pay. - Repair what? - Everything. Where will we go? - To my parents'. - ln Chalon? - We never see them. - lt's time we did. Is it this that stinks? What did the doctor say? It's okay. He's stopping the treatment to see. Stopping everything? You'll be happy. You'll have a room with a big bed, a quilt. Take the bin out, please. - How much do we need? - What for? For the repairs. I don't know. 1 ,000, 2,000 euros? Hi, Bruno. How are you? Room No.9 Where's the toilet? Come. lt'd be good if we kept the same movement, but light, like you asked us to. Very light. How about... in the same movement. Let's do that. Hey! What are you still doing here? - What do you want? - To see my father. - Who is he? - Samuel Rovinski. Sorry to disturb you, but the kid over there... What's your name? Victor. - How old are you? - 1 3. 1 4, soon. My mother is Nadia. l don't have any children. I was with the journalist. He wants to bring in a photographer. He won't write a 3-page article without photos. l don't have time. He can just take some shots. Samuel... - What do we do? - Whatever you want. I don't know if it's still here. Miguel? What the hell are you doing? I'm showing him your room. In my closet? He needs a camera. Get out of here. l asked him for it. What will you give me in its place? I can do your homework for you. All of it? French. English and maths too. So? Okay. English, maths, biology and physics. Sports. Get out! What's that? Old stuff. That's mine. It's too small. Just because Mahler called it "tragic", you don't have to whine. Tragic can be terrifying. What's that kid doing there? He's doing it for school. A presentation. A presentation on what? On me. It's a misunderstanding. No photos will be taken during rehearsals. Figure 88. 88. Softer. Softer. 88. Too dry. Too hard, too dry. What exactly does he want? We're following you, maestro. Ladies and gentlemen, 20 minutes' break. Are you after money? How much? 1 ,000 euros. Is that okay? Why did you come back? Because I was asked to. That's all? What do you want? - Hello. - Hello. - Gendarmerie. Are you his mother? - Yes. We found him thumbing a lift. He had no papers. I don't know where my lD card is. Do you both live here? Alright. The next time, watch him more closely. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Why didn't Omar bring you back? He couldn't. Why didn't you call me? l'm out of credit. lt wasn't clever to bring them back here. Keep the family-record book with you. - On me? - No, put it away. - What for? - Because it's important. There are lD photos in here if you need them. As we're about it, your health book. Actually, all the health records. Don't need that. What else? - What's this? - For the repairs. You saw him? What did he say? - We don't have to leave... - What did he say? Nothing. He saw you and said nothing? No. You asked him for money and he gave you this? - Give it back to him. - Why? - Stop it. - Enough. You're too thin. Good evening. See you tomorrow. - Seen my trainers? - No. Rubbish. You used mine till last year. Give them back. - No. - Why not? They're comfortable. What do l wear? Here. "What do l wear?" Victor? 6 out of 20. What happened? You alright? Yes. And your mum? - lf you want to talk... - Talk about what? l left you 1 0 messages. What the hell...? Why didn't you come to training? - My ankle hurts. - lt's fine. You know how many they choose per year? What does your mum say? She agrees. I doubt it. l'm going to talk to her. - Stop. - Stop what? You're scared. Scared the others will be better than you? Yes, that's it. You'd better come. You forgot to put Charlemagne. Who's that? I won't answer you if you speak in Spanish. Who's that? A French king. I'm not staying here all night. And so what? l don't care about Charlemagne. Charlemagne. Write it. - No. - Why no? l don't write the kings who aren't Spanish. You think l'm going to hang around for hours with you? Now, let's do it again. Your mother's going to die. If I do 50 dribbles, will you learn the kings? 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1 0. An early birthday gift. - How much did it cost? - Michel gave it. Go on. Here. You'll be glad of it there. Where? At Nan and Grandpa's. What's wrong? - l'm talking to you. - Get lost. What do we do now? Any news, or what? Silence, please. Silence. Okay, that's enough. The rehearsal is cancelled. You can leave. They play like shit. - l've got better things to do. - Leave them alone. We don't want it. Can I stay with you? You know anything about music? Nothing. lt's still here? - Who did you sell it to? - To the conservatoire. lt was hard, but now, they count on it. Shall l call them back? ls that the rehearsal music? Who was that? Your mother? No. She's my harmony teacher. I thought she was your mother. I have dreams. l'm dribbling and the defenders rush me. l shoulder charged one and right-kicked the other. Then l enter the area, facing the goalkeeper. I knock the guy out, I hit hard, but before the ball reaches the goal, it disappears. I can't see the ball anymore. - What sport do you play? - Football. The trainer chose me as captain this year. You don't need to know about music to feel things. During the rehearsals, for example... No? How many pictures crossed your mind? What does it make you think of? I don't know. You must relax. Close your eyes and you'll start to see... I don't know, maybe water, a forest. It makes you sad, happy. It makes you feel like you can move mountains. Did you feel anything? No. No emotion at all? I'll give you 2 CDs. 2 versions of the "6th". Listen to them and note down whatever crosses your mind. Why did you come back? To see me? Yes? "Terrible", why? How could l have known? You didn't say you were leaving? You didn't tell your mother anything? She's searching all over for you. She called the theatre. How long have you been living here? 3 years. Where's your home? There. Where it's open? Listen. Why did you call him? What did you tell him? I didn't get him. I spoke to a lady. You're jealous. You called because you want to see him. No. l don't care about him. - You used me. - Do what you want with him. But don't bring him here. l don't want him to see where we live. He's going to take me with him. We've got all that we need. Okay. No problem. You think I'll fly away? Fly away? Well... What do you mean? That's the plan. You were afraid yesterday? Yes, a little bit. Why did you do that? Get out. Get out! - l listened to it. - And? It's long. First movement. Figure 1 7. lt must just be played forte. The winds alone. 3 then 1 7. More stress on the start of the triple. Once more. Good. The winds and violins only. Play all the notes as tenuto as possible. Good. Come here. Come on. I hope you don't mind. Take that off. 6th out of 24. The bells. Do you even know what story you're telling? It's there. What do l write? "My son, Victor, could not attend class this week, "owing to a flu." They won't check. It's a lie. - I don't want to say the truth. - Why not? They won't understand. What does that say? "Excuse." The oboe, can you please play alone? Yes. The oboe alone. No, that's not right. Try again. Fuller, maybe, and bring the phrase in third. Mum? Are you okay? At the opera. Did Omar tell you that? l don't stand a chance. He's fantasizing. Why do you say that? Come on. Have a good match. Go on, take it. Fast. Hold, hold. That's good. Go on, Brice. Leave it. Come on. - Hey guys, not here. - Come off. Victor, Romain. Come on. Baptiste. Go on, take his place. Blue, take your marks. Go, go, go. Baptiste. Make an effort. Control. Counter-attack. To Jules. It's coming. Come on, white. Get on it. Victor. Victor! Victor. Come on, get back on. Shake hands, and now it's game time. Okay? Max? Maxime, change! Referee. Brice, Brice! Brice, come on. Victor? Come on, move it! Mum? Are you okay? Why didn't you say about the training centre? What do you mean? You know what it means if you're taken on? - You want me to call the doctor? - No. - Happy birthday. - Happy... - Sing. - No way. Come on, Miguel. Happy birthday to you May your wishes come true Wait! Not you, carry on. Happy birthday to you May your wishes come true l don't know the rest. Bravo. Here. Be careful, it's mine. Thanks. l must have some hooks somewhere around. There. lt's not brand new, but it caught quite a lot of fish. Will you be able to eat? Very funny! That's for unlocking, like that, and turn. Show Nadia. Unscrew this. There. And screw it back. Easy. She has a hole. Show me. - For you. - Thank you. I like it. l don't. Miguel. That's the name of a boyfriend. It's stupid, because when you don't love him anymore, you can't remove it. At least when Luna's fed up, she can remove it. Miguel. ls that your real hair? Miguel. No. - You want me to take it off? - Mum... - Can l? - Yes. You want it? It doesn't matter. My mother's with the doctor. She'll be okay. "Thousands of stars in the sky. "Thousands of birds in the trees. "Thousands of flowers in the garden." Goodnight. Victor. - What? - Are you going to leave? Go to sleep. Stop looking at me. - What's that? - What? That. A hammer blow. You know why? No. ln the symphony, there are 3, for 3 strokes of fate. One year after Mahler wrote the music, he had heart disease, he lost his job and his daughter, as if he'd foreseen what would happen. When he conducted his symphony, he removed the last stroke, to "advert" the spell. Avert the spell. The conductors can chose 2 or 3. This is the best bit. - Are there any batteries? - Look in the draw. We'll go wherever you want, but don't stop the treatment. You can't give up. - Do l look ridiculous? - Not at all. It's nice. They've accepted you. They've accepted you at the training centre. I'll watch you on TV. Right. Here. l can never do it. You must pass the button through. Ever been on a plane? No. You look like your mum. THE LAST HAMMER BLOW
