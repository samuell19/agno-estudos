let's go let's go let's go let's go! come on! Yes! Come on! No! Dammit! Took you long enough. I had play practice late. When are you going to get a job and stop screwing around with this community theater stuff? I asked a question boy. I’m sixteen dad, it’s not easy finding a job at my age. Are you working on homework? How’s the job search going? None of your business. Actually... I'm working on a project for government. Let me see. What the heck is this? I’m taking a break. I asked you a question. What the heck is this? It’s a modeling website. People take pictures with photographers and they build their portfolios. You want to be a model now? I’ve thought about it. Well stop thinking about it. You’re never going to be a model. Yea but mom always said that I- Don’t bring your mother into this. She filled your head full of nonsense. These sites are the fastest way into pornography. Come on dad it's not like- Stop fighting me on this. Your break is over. I don’t ever want to see you on this site again. Do you understand? Yes, dad. Good Morning. Morning. That’s what I was waiting for. It’s almost as good as your coffee. Maybe better. There's a fresh pot. Ooh Thanks! How is it out there? It’s looking like a hot summer. It's going to be beautiful. I’m off to the studio. I’ll see you tonight? Yea... Are you still working on that piece? Yea... yea. That's great how's it going? Fine. We'll see. That's good. What’s for dinner? Rice and beans, your favorite. Oh, that sounds good. I'll see you later, Alright? Yup. Bye. ...a few months now. Are you going to a lot of go-sees? A couple, but my portfolio is a bit thin. We're trying to fix that today. What are we looking for? Well, it's a residential neighborhood so we're looking for something interesting like bricks... wrought iron fence. Something that adds texture to the image without taking away from the focus. I'm trying to quit. yea, looks like you started that one earlier. Do you want one? No. No, I'm trying to take care of myself. I screwed off enough in my twenties. How do they look? They look good it's a good set. Time to take off? Not yet. Are the pictures edgy enough? Rich wanted "edgy." It's a good start. Come on let's go. My boys are back! How'd the shoot go? It was good, it was good. He's really showing a lot of promise. I'd like to shoot him again. Good, I’m thinking of using him as my next cover model. Aren’t I? Huh? Dense as bricks, every single one of them. Come over here, I forgot to compensate you for last night. Don’t worry about it. Now there’s someone with a good attitude. He’s a good boy isn’t he? Are you ready for your gig tonight? Uh huh. See you next week. Now bounce along. Okay. He’s got this thing he likes to do when I forget to pay him... Oh! Here's you're take on the shoot. Ah, my pleasure. So... I was thinking. I’ve been shooting for you for a long time... You have. The relationship has been mutually beneficial. Indeed. What do you want? I was thinking... maybe we could do another headshot day each month. Done. Really? That easy? Yea. You're bringing in enough talent for it? I just signed five guys this week. Wow, that’s great. You know I get, uh- grab a seat. I get emails everyday from photographers begging to shoot my models for free, but none of them has your business sense. Thanks So... How is the design coming for next month? The future is selfies. Everyone wants fame. I throw a teaser of a naked guy on the cover- twelve of his selfies on page six. He goes down and brags to his friends in atlanta at club Ding Dong. I sell a thousand copies. Really? mmhmm I could throw you some of the harder stuff too. I know you’re straight and all. Doesn’t bother me much. Didn’t think it would. I mean it's just Herb Ritz style images? They're all artistic? Exactly, all artistic. All the time. You'll here from me when I next require your talents. Thanks. The one thing a selfie can’t do? You give my boys class. Goodbye, Rich. It’s really too bad your webcam isn’t working. "...I need to get a new 1." How close are your images to what you look like in person? "Clos... I think" I think you’ve got a great look. "Really?" To be honest though I really can’t say definitively until I meet you in person. "Maybe after school gets out lol I want to come into the city soo bad." Hey, take your time. Unfortunately you don’t get a do over on high school, or anything else in life for that matter. "I guess lols" Listen, I gotta jump. Here’s my number if you ever want to talk on the phone. "Thanks!!! And ty for talking to me :-)" Anytime. Smiley face right back at ya kid. [door slams] Hey dad where'd you go? Dad? So you want to be a model? Dad, seriously? Answer me boy. You know I was fine having a faggot for a son. I was fine with that. I could give two flying fucks. But a fairy? A little princess? Dad. Stop. Please Stop! Thank you. Yea. This looks Good. How was your day? Average, almost done working on the new piece that I'm working on. Oh, that's great! What did you do? I had a development shoot with a new model. I saw Marco at the studio. Really? We’re good friends now. How would you know that? He’s been out of town for the last year. We’ve stayed in touch online. Really? We’re mature adults. What do you talk about? You know, stuff. Things about our relationship? Sometimes. I need a guy’s opinion. What do I say that’s so confusing? You go running all the time. I like running. It's my thing. I could go running with you. I run so that I can think. It's me time. Why don't we have a couple over, isn't that what people do? I don’t know any other couples, do you? No... I guess not. Why not someone from dance? There's gotta be someone you take class with. Marco is a friend from dance and I’d really like to have him over for dinner. Jenny! She’s married, she has a husband, we can invite them over. He’s a suit. So? You’re not going to get along with him. I get along just fine with a lot of people. Yea, okay- just keep telling yourself that. Hey. I’m hurt. Finish your rice. Yes, Pumpkin. Are you leaving? Yea, I've got to go take some pictures. Oh, I was hoping we could watch a movie together. It’s going to be a mad house out there I've got to finish this art project. I promise after I'm done with this- I'll watch whatever you want to watch for a month. You promise? I promise... even if its got Richard Gere in it. Okay. I love you baby. Hey. Rich. It’s really you? Do I look like my pictures? Even better. Come in. Drink? Sure. Will one of these be okay. Yea, sure. I love the new profile picture. Really? Cheers! I can’t believe it’s taken so long for us to finally meet in person. My dad wouldn’t let me come into the city. Oh? Has that changed? I really don’t want to talk about it. Oh... you don’t need to worry about him now. Come on, keep your head up buddy, it's going to be alright Why don't you sit down? You know... I don't know about this. Oh, come on, relax. I want to hear about everything. You’re cute but you’re not a model. I could totally be a model. Look, I’ve got a great set of abs. Yes, they are great. You’re a development case though. What does that mean? You’re trying to get started in the hardest industry in the world. You need pictures to book jobs. Oh. Hey relax. We have plenty of time. Yea? And there's other types of modeling you can do in the meantime. I run this glamour magazine called Rock Hard. Well can I model for it? I think we could manage that. Can you take direction? I’ve been in a few school plays. I'll tell you what, I'll take some shots tomorrow. If you look good, I’ll turn you over to my development photographer. You want another beer? Uh...Yea, Sure. Thanks. Have you ever been with another man? No, I haven’t. There aren’t a lot of options where I come from. What’s your favorite feature in a guy? I like their shoulders. You smell good, clean... fresh. I took a shower. I'm just clowning with you. Come on, don’t be so serious. Sorry. I’m trying. Is there anything I could do to make you feel more comfortable? The talking is actually helping a lot. Tell me what else you like in guys. Their chests... their arms- What about their tight asses? No... I’ve never seen any. Not even in the locker room at school? No, that wouldn't be a good idea. No. You, Don’t want to get caught staring at asses in the locker room do you? No. Well, it has been great finally meeting you. I have work tomorrow. Oh right. You've got some friends you could stay with? Right? I’d like to see you at my office tomorrow. Actually no. Oh? Well, that’s a shame. Well, you could stay a couple days here if you like. No you've already been way to good- Hey, listen, my guest room recently became available. No, you’ve already been- I insist. Please, be my guest. Okay. You are so beautiful Thanks. I didn’t hear you come in. Do you mind if I take a few pictures? No, not at all. That’s why I’m here right? You look amazing in this light. We need to get your portfolio started. Go ahead and look outside. Good! Good! I knew you’d be a natural. Here's some cash. I've got to head into work. What for? Well you're going to need it if you plan on staying in New York. I hadn’t really thought about that. I’d hate to see you depart. I haven’t decided yet. Crash here if you want for a few weeks, or months. Are you sure? Sure. Are we friends? Yea. Stick around. I’ll pay you back. When you’re on your feet. So... what do I do today? It's a gorgeous day out, go to the beach. I didn’t pack a swimsuit though. You can borrow mine. Have fun in the sun. I'll see you at my office later on. That felt great, didn’t it? Yea, I need to get into better shape. You’ve got to get into better shape? Yea, I’m trying to work on my six pack back. We could do another lap. I don’t need it that badly. Let's take a breather first alright? Do you want to come over? I can't. I’ve got lunch with my fiancée. You been shooting much recently? Yea, springs around the corner, it’s going to be a beautiful summer and business has started picking up already. Even added an extra headshot session each month. Isn’t that where you take all the actors and models and line them up like cattle? Yea... something like that. I remember those. They’re like assembly lines. Everyone wears the same clothes, does the same poses, and it all ends up looking the same. And they pay. More hot boys? A couple. Oh? Is that by design? I’m not into guys. Just leave it alone okay? What were we Tim? A couple drunken nights in college. And about three months worth of nights when you moved to New York. Thanks for letting me crash on your couch. I don’t know why. You hardly ever used the couch. I was cold. It was winter, That's funny, the radiators, they get so hot. I usually have to open the windows in January to keep the apartment livable. I’m happy, Please let me be happy. Are you really? How could I not be? I live in the best city in the world. I have a beautiful fiancée. You got the package. My parents leave me alone now. I’m making money on photography for once. It works. It just- It just works. You’re further gone than I thought. You know what? Yea. Let's take that extra lap. Come on let's go. Are you coming to bed soon? Yea, I'll be in in a minute. I'm just finishing something up. Don't forget we have that appointment with the jeweler tomorrow afternoon. Okay. I’ll be there soon as I finish with my meeting with Rich. Okay? See you in a minute. There was one I really liked. Luke, my newest project. I’d like to do a private session with him. I don’t think he’s ready for you yet. I shoot all of your new talent. He’s greener than most. I don’t know if he could handle your intensity yet. Could you at least run it by him first? When he comes by later this afternoon, I’ll ask him then. Thanks. Don’t mention it. I assume the actors I've sent your way have been worthwhile.. Oh, right! Sorry. Worth it. Pleasure doing business. Hey, just wanted to let you know I’m running a bit late at the agency. Rich asked me to stick around for a bit longer. I know that this appointment is important. I'll try to make it, but it doesn't look like I'll be able to get out of here on time. [muffled] Why is my head pounding? Looks like the culprit. I can't look at another liquor bottle. What the fuck are you doing here? I had a good time though... How'd you get in here. I’m tired, can't I just sleep for another hour? No, you get the fuck out now. I'm sick of sleeping outside. What do I have to do for- What do I have to do for you? There’s a solo scene shooting in midtown. They're looking for used talent. I’d say you look pretty used. Solo? Nothing more than you’d be doing in your own in a shower. It’s just being video taped. Porn. Hey, if you want to get in my- If you want to get back in my good graces you’ve got to pull your weight around here. I'm trying to be an actor. I can’t have my face out there like that. Wear a hat. Well- You’re kidding. No. Well, I don't want to. Sometimes in life we do things we don’t want to do. Shit. You want to get out of here you ungrateful little user? I have nowhere to go. I don’t even have my pants on. I can't leave. Good place to start. Are these your pants? Yes. Yes, Sir. Yes, Sir. I bought these pants. Your shirt and your panties too. Come on, please, stop. What? Stop what you ungrateful little- I have gone way out on a limb for you. Well uh- Well- I- Let me stay. No. Please? You are such an ungratedul little- Get out of my apartment. Yea.

It's okay, everything is going to be okay. Alright? I hate that you make me do that to you. It's imperrative- you've been a really bad boy. Have you been a bad boy? Yes. Yes you have. Are you going to be a good boy now and do what you're told? uh huh. Yes you are. Luke this is Michael. The two of you should really get to know each other. That'll do. You have somewhere else you need to go. Make me proud Michael. I’ll text you the address. You can start by taking the 6 train to 33rd street. Are you finished? With him? Yes. Are you ready for your shoot today? Yea. Excellent. Do you need some money? No, I’m fine. Here, take some cab fare for later. A boy like you should never take the subway. I’ll catch you later, pumpkin, alright? Don’t look so nervous alright? You have a good shoot. Hey. Hi, Tim right? Yea. You ready to shoot Yea, sure. Sorry, do you want to come in? No, that's alright. I'd rather just get out and take some shots. What do you want me to wear? I think what you've got on is just fine. Okay. Let's go. uh, I don't know about these. No, the first couple are always burners. Oh. Go a couple more. There! Oh! See, you start started to warm up to the camera. Yea. Yea! Oh, yea, I see it! You're really starting to warm up to the camera. You're starting to get more comfortable. I really think we could shoot the cover next month. Really? Yea, Really. I can’t. But I want to. But I can’t. Just leave it at that okay? You’re so beautiful you know that? Your eyes, your skin, your lips. How'd the shoot go? Good. You should go now Tim. I should go. Hands off the merchandise. Do you read me? Loud and clear. He’s mine. Okay. How'd it go? good. You look a little wound up. He didn’t try anything unprofessional did he? No, not really. He tried to kiss me actually. I’m sure a lot of people want to kiss you. Let’s go shopping. You look like you could use some new pants. The car is waiting downstairs. I’ll follow in a moment. Hey, what's going on Tim? can I get a beer? You got it. Thanks Here you go man. Thanks. You're in here early. Yea. Rough day? Why did we stop? There's someone very important I want you to meet. Okay. He’s a client of mine. The reservation will be under your name. He’s very discreet. You're not coming with me? No. I do a lot of things for you, Luke, don’t I? You do. I need you to do this one thing for me. Make sure he has a good evening. I’ll see you tomorrow and I'll have your clothes at home. I’m not so sure about this. You don’t need to be sure about it. You just need to do it. He’s a really big fashion photographer, and it'd be great for your career. He is? Yes. He shoots for most of the top magazines. I don’t know about this. You’re a smart kid. Sometimes in life we do things that we don't want to. Those new pants really look great on you don’t they? They do. Alright, go on he’s waiting. It's been a long time since I had a drink with you here. I know. I started coming back a couple weeks ago. What’s going on with you? I don’t know. Why can’t life just be simple? What would the fun be in a simple life? I was supposed to host a dinner party with Sarah tonight. That sounds like fun. It’s like I’m just going through the motions. Did the party get canceled? No. So, finish your drink and go. I don’t want to. That’s not going to make your life simpler. I know. I had a shoot today. Great. How did it go? Oh... it was so good. He is so beautiful. I’m sure that helps. It does. It reminds me of the way we were. Young, innocent, and oblivious to the way the world works. Simple. Simple. Did you fuck him? I wanted to. Is there something wrong with me for that? As if putting myself inside of him could steal just a little bit of that innocence for a minute. You’re infatuated with what he represents. The idea of it. Good evening my friend. Rich told me about how well you've been doing. There's some business partners I'd like you to meet. Take your shirt off. I have to take some polaroids. I don't know if I'm comfortable with this. You're level of comfort is not important. There are many who take pleasure in fear. Where are these gonna go? Online, to my clients I know people that would pay On your website. You can say that. Take your pants off, please. No. Take them off. No... I think I'm gonna go. Relax, I'm just checking out the merchandise. I'm not here to be sold. My friend, people have been selling you since you moved to New York. Now this is the last time I'm going to ask you to take off your pants. You are totally the take home to mom type. Am not. You are too. Come home with me tonight, Tim. I can’t. I know you want to. We can curl up into each other like we used to. I can do all those things to you that your girlfriend can’t. Fiancée... screw me. I am such a dick. Forget about her. Just us. I need to call her. No you don’t. She’s going to have my head on a platter. She’s doesn’t know you. It doesn’t matter. She will go on and find another guy. If you’re going down that rabbit hole tonight- I’m gone leaving. I can explain everything. You can’t explain anything. You’re drunk. I am not. I’m gonna leave. Are you coming? No. Goodbye, Tim. What’s going on. You were supposed to do something tonight that was very important to me. He was a freak. You didn’t do it. I’m not a prostitute. And what are you Luke? I’m a model. Yes you are, New York's finest. Have I ever asked anything of you, Luke? Well uh- Have you enjoyed our time together? How much have I done for you? A lot. I asked this one little thing of you and you couldn’t do it. Could you? This is not how things work. What are you doing? This is not going to be pleasant. [grunts] Hi honey. You're drunk. No. I had a quick drink before coming home. I needed to loosen myself up before- It’s practically midnight they're gone now. I can’t believe you, Tim. You have absolutely no respect for me whatsoever. I love you. No you don’t. I’m coming home so we can talk. I’d really rather if you didn’t. I don’t want to see you right now. I don’t want to hear your excuses. Alright I’ll sleep on the couch. No. You won’t. I already called downstairs and they won’t let you up. What? You can’t do that. I’m on the lease too. I live there too. No, you don’t. You really don’t own a lot of things Tim. What are you saying. Jenny and Brad were all too happy to help me pack up your clothes and leave them in a duffel bag with the doorman. You’re kicking me out? We’re done. I will not be treated like this. I don’t deserve your lies and manipulation. What are you talking about? I packed up your computer. What’s with all the boys? It’s an art project. Yea, sure, you keep telling yourself that. Goodbye Tim. Wait- Who the fuck? What are you doing here? Get out. What the hell have you done? Nothing and you’re too drunk to remember anyways. Get the fuck out now. [fight sounds]
