Subtitle by lucile_7 Where the fire burns the heart ... Where my secret is hidden ... There, where the shadows find the people ... That's where... My story begins. In that country the people knew no joy. Their eyes were always full of tears. Their hearts were full of fear and horror. Where the sky used to be, there was only death and ruin. And they gave the sky what was most precious to them their most precious jewels. Previously there was no time, no earth and no dust. Everything was forgotten. What used to be wrong suddenly turned into truth. The river froze in the void. Time is a fast flowing river. He spares nobody. The bride is expecting her groom, while awaiting her fate. She is dressed in white, as if wrapped in a shroud. Eternal peace awaits you. The wedding bell rings. Take her away! Take her away! Come! Come and get her. Fly! The young maiden is yours for all eternity. But the love of a brave knight was stronger than his fear. That knight swore, to find and rescue his beloved. He traveled for a very long time the land, crossed forests and seas. But when he finally reached the cave It was already too late. His beloved was gone. Then the knight attacked the beast. His pain and rage merged into a single blow. So the knight freed his people of fear and terror, and from that day they are called Dragon Slayers. Years passed and the suffering from that time was forgotten. What once was a cruel ritual became a wedding ceremony. But then came the day when Igor, the grandson of the dragon slayer, and the daughter of the duke Miraslava would marry. Igor! Igor! Do you hear that, Mira? Your groom has arrived. Bring her things while she plays. I'm not playing. I am thinking. Too bad that there are no more dragons. Stop it. Do you want to curse your wedding day? Should a dragon kidnap you, for Igor to fight? A dragon slayer would be tempted. Don't you have any other worries? My paper dragon is not flying. You with your daydreaming! Your toy, your groom, their all the same. You have no feelings. Hey, that hurts! - Then sit still. You are jealous, because you are not married. Igor has the best horse. - Then marry his horse. You are hurting me! - Get this toy away! Marriage is not a game, it's your life! Leave me alone, Yara! You are not my mother! You can't love, because you have no heart! Shut up, you old maid! - What? So what's is going on here? What's wrong again? But father, she ... ... - Enough! Everyone is waiting, and you're still here with your sister! If you knew, what she said to me, father. All right then. What did she say to you? Nothing. Your toy is nothing. Your dragons, princesses and fairy tales. You refuse to grow up, you are no longer a child, do you hear? Mira, you are soon to be a duchess. You have to see that and behave accordingly. I know what's best for you. Igor is the right one for you. You'll learn to love him. And he will learn to love you. Trust your father's heart. If there's love, everything else will follow. We have never forgotten the dark times, when we gave our daughters sacrificed to the dragon. We remember and will always remember. The one who once defeated the beast! Today is the day we give our beautiful and precious daughters to the most venerable men handed over to our country! Don't do it! It just makes him aggressive. Put the stone down. Put it down. Don't look him in the eyes. Lay down. Show your neck. Hey! Hey! Who's there? Did Igor send you to save me? No. I don't know who Igor is. Help me get out of here. I am the daughter of the Duke. My father will reward you. - I can't help you. Are you a prisoner? Nobody can escape the dragon. This creature ... It is kind of a watchdog? Yes. Where is the dragon now? He's sleeping. It is too dangerous for us to talk to each other. What is he planning to do with me? What will happen to me? I already told you too much. Now you are on your own. No, no, please! Talk to me! No! Please! Why do your people have sung the Song of the Dragon? We thought the dragon was gone. You called him in. Igor demanded so. Who is Igor? - My groom. I don't know anything about that. I was going to marry! Today I give my youngest daughter Miraslava to the noble grandson of the hero, who freed us from the beast. and no one is happier than me, because today I trust my daughter the most worthy knight of our country! Igor! Look! Here comes the grandson of the dragon slayer! Time is a fast flowing river. He spares nobody. The bride is expecting her groom, while awaiting her fate. She is dressed in white, as if wrapped in a shroud. Eternal peace awaits her ... Why are they singing the Dragon Song? To honor the dragon slayer, to remember that are no more dragons. Take her away! Take her away! Come on! Come and get her. Fly! The young maiden is yours for all... Look, Mom! Mom! What's hapenning? Dragon! Run! No! No! No! My daughter! Mira! Here. That's for your wounds. They will heal faster. You don't look like a prisoner. Do you think so? - I thought you were very dirty and full of cobwebs. But you seem ... different. Thanks! It smell nice. What is it? There are special leaves above the cave. If you make an ointment, it will heal your wounds. You know what i noticed? - What? We still don't know each other's names. My name is Mira. And you? I don't remember my name. How so? How is it possible to forget your name? It's possible, if you already... ...if you don't need it. You... are so beautiful. - You are watching me! Yes. - Don't look! Why? - How why? ... Don't you understand? No, I watch birds, fish. Why can't I look? Have you tried to escape? - You can't escape from here. We are on an island. Can't we sail away? The sea will kill you. I need a big stone. - What do you need it for? I have a plan: When the evil creature returns, you distract, and I'll kill it. We flee when the dragon sleeps. You can't get out of the cave! Only the dragon slayer knows how to defeat the dragon. Wait and he will get you out of here. That's enough! I need to escape. Can you help me? -You can't get out, Mira! He hears everything, sees everything! You can not even imagine what he is capable of. Do you know what you are? A coward. Quite an ordinary coward! I was a fool, thinking about a name for you! And don't dare to look at me any more! Sleep, dear child. Fly away ... Mira. Mira, what are you doing? Mind your own business. - Mira, I'm not a coward. I also hate the dragon. But I can't beat him. Only a coward says that. Mira... What name have you choosen for me? Armand. Armand, beautiful name. Why Armand? Well ... It sounds exotic. It fits you very well. It is mysterious. What does it mean? Dream. Forgive me, Mira. Give me your hand. - My hand? Now that you have a name, we can make ourselves known. When people are introduced, they shake hands. It's nice to meet you, Armand. I am Mira. It's nice to meet you too, Mira. I am Armand. No! - The Dragon! Beware, Mira! Whatever happens don't leave the cave! Armand! Armand, where are you? Where are you, Armand? Armand! Where are you? Don't leave me alone! Armand? Where are you, Armand? Armand, where are you? Armand? Attention! That's is very high. - Your alive! Why did you leave the cave? You shouldn't! That's what he's waiting for! Why does that creature obey you? Mira ... - Who are you? Mira, wait ... - Stay away from me! That's hard to explain. Watch where you go! I trusted you! But you lied! Mira, the dragon... - The dragon gets nothing! Mira, don't do it! - Nothing! Wait! Wait! Mira, no! Let me go! Trust me! It is not time yet! Now! Is someone there? Is there anyone? Help! I'm here! Help! I don't like this, Igor. Is much too quiet here. The island should be right here. But there is only this strange fog here. And I haven't seen such a fog in my life. But you have already heard about it. Surely your grandfather has described this fog in the secret route. Did you forget it? No I have not! Where is the secret route? Secret here, secret there, I hear that all my life, but a dragon is still alive. Don't worry. I know what we are doing. I'm worried about the girl. We have to save her before it's too late. I'm here! Is anyone there? Stay away from me! That's all right! So be it. That's better. Yes! It was not my fault. It was the sea. Even the sea can be deadly. I really don't know why I'm doing this. What should I do with it? This is better? I don't want to drag this reptile! So he saved me? Now I have saved him. He kidnapped me and throwed me against the rocks, and now i help him? And who helps me? He probably won't. How far should I drag him? When you are strong again, will you carry me home? I knew you would like my ideia. Good, you kidnapped me, but I am not angry with you. It is more important to me that you are nice. Even if you weigh too much. And you live too high up. For no good reason. After all, I now know why. I don't know where is your bed, so you sleep here first. Before it is too late... Kill the dragon. He comes closer and closer. He comes closer and closer. The fire of the dragon must go out. Armand? Kill him. Kill the dragon. Not yet, I need you. Alive, healthy and flying! Can someone hear me? I'm here! Help! Igor! Now I have a name. I am Armand. Mira ... Just don't burn. Here... That's better. And now sleep well, do you hear? Nice and easy... Calm! Sleep, dear child. Fly away, wind... I'll wait for you until the morning comes. Sleep, dear child. You're sailing to distant lands hear my voice, in the big clouds. Sleep, dear child. Don't be afraid. In the land of your dreams someone thinks of you. My dear! My Mira! I knew you would save me. Good morning, Armand! Why did you brought me food and a blanket, if you don't even talk to me? Armand you apologized then you push me away. You threw me in a cave and then you save my life. Armand, answer me! Either we talk, or i won't leave you alone. I can be really exhausting. Now i know why my ancestors didn?t talk much i never heard women speaking. Armand, you are right don?t talk to me. What good will I do then? Just take me home. It's not that easy. Explain it to me maybe I?ll understand and we can think of something. Long ago lived on this island, a bright boy. He lived here with his father. And his father was a dragon. The boy loved his father and dreamed of becoming like him. But one day the sea brought ashore a wooden box. There was something strange in it. I still don?t know what it's called. It came from a foreign and unknown, but still familiar world. Something in the boy changed. And when the time came, that he would become a dragon, He no longer wanted it. His father didn?t do anything about it. Nobody can become a dragon against their will. One day a ship appeared in the distance. A man came ashore, and killed the boy's father. The boy was overcome with great anger, and wanted revenge. He jumped off the cliff and turned into a dragon. Suddenly, flow through him the memories of his ancestors. And he could see everything what the dragons had seen. And the boy felt everything they felt. For centuries they performed on the Brides of men their bloody ritual. People sent their daughters away, accompanied by a song. But he didn?t want that. He was plagued by visions and saw dead brides whose death he was guilty of. The boy realized that his Father was a monster. and that now he had awakened the monster in himself. He vowed to make sure that there would never be a dragon again. He wanted to be a man again but he didn?t know how. Everything he could do was to fight the dragon. Down in the cave there?s a narrow passage. A human gets in there, but a dragon can not come out. I stayed there when I had to fight the dragon Over the years, I almost did it. but then I heard the song of the dragon. When I came to, I saw a girl in the claws. I could barely manage his grip to loosen the girl. You fell into a narrow cave and the dragon couldn't reach you. The cave was not your prison, but a refuge fom me. The dragon can smell you, Mira. I follow the smell to the cave. He awoke in the moment we touched. That's why I can?t carry you back home. I am unable to control the dragon. You have to wait for the dragon slayer. If he comes to fetch you, I will not stop him. But your people are not allowed to sing the dragon song anymore. What does it mean "if"? Is he not coming? It only depends on you. How so? I do not understand. Follow me. How does it depend on me if Igor gets here or not? Look carefully. The entire island is a dragon. My ancestor, so to speak. The cliffs, the rocks, these are all his bones. He guards this place. From here you can see the clear, blue sky while all the people on the ships see nothing outside but fog. You are damned to wander around in it until you die. Sometimes wrecks and others things wash ashore. but the passenger can only reach the island if the loving heart of a girl waits for him here. The heart? Yes. Yes. It will show him the way like a beacon. That probably means that the dragon slayer only found this island because the girl loved him, right? As I said, it only depends on you. If you love him, he will come. What are you doing? When someone receives flowers, that person knows that is loved. This is a special bond between two people. And besides: If you throw flowers into the sea then your beloved knows that you think of him wherever he may be. So, Igor will come rescue you? Right? Yes for sure. I think he will. Then he should hurry. You will wait for him in the cave. - In the cave? Armand, can we just sail? - No. I've already explained, and we are almost... Armand, did you hurt yourself? - Don?t touch me! Go to the cave! Do not you understand? Armand, no. I can?t leave you here. Go away! I'll manage. I want to be alone. If that?s true, why did i woke up this morning under a warm blanket? Mira, the dragon can break out at any moment. And why has not that already happened? I don?t know. Maybe i?m still too weak. Maybe the man has become stronger. Do you really believe that? I can see it. You saved me, gave me food, healed my wounds. You took care of me. You will defeat him. As you always wanted. And I'll help you. And while i wait for Igor, I?ll help you to live like a human. You? Forgive me. For yesterday. That's a good start. Incredible. You can live here if you want. Here you are safe from the dragon. Armand! - Yes. It is so bare here. Would you like to help me, make it comfortable? - Is it necessary? Well, we have decided to live like people... To live like people is a tough job. We need this, and that... - Is not that enough? Come, I will show how to play. How do I look? Unfortunately, my hair is so short. - I like it. You know what? I like it too! What are you doing? - I envy you dragons! Why?! - Well ... You do what you want to do. You fly wherever you want to go. But it is also scary. I have never traveled anywhere. Neither did I. But why? I have been on this island all my life. I didn't want the dragon ... So i suppose that flight was the first one, for both of us? That's the way it is, I think. This one? No. And this? - No. ...maybe, yes! Wait! Wipe your feet. What are you doing? Your place is here now. And for him... Armand! How far can dragons fly? - Very far. The winds help us. Carry us gently. It?s unique. When you see the wind. You can see the wind? Of course, I can. Don?t you? People don?t see the wind, Armand. How can?t yout see the wind? - And how can you see it? If you want, I'll show it to you. As the flame burns your eyes heart confuses his beats. To love is scary but I'm not afraid - I will sleep and will not wake up. I'm not there already - was ash and smoke. Burned even my tears. You're not my people, but i?m not a foreign; Friend or foe - choose it yourself. I think it will start now. What? I believe in you and reveal all the secrets a relentless beast - I know you're not my enemy. Spread your wings and let your dreams become true take me boldly - like last time. Get away from my bag! These are my things. What did you think, I am a traitor and i want to flee? But how should I know if he can really defeat the dragon? No worries. Maybe I dont?t have to go. I have my bag packed only for emergencies. I wanted to catch fish. A seagull came and grabbed my fish! It has never been so nice here. Until you came. Well, a few things were new for both of us. By the way, I have a surprise for you. I think I?ve heard it before. What is it? - A lullaby. Mothers sing it to their children when they are born. Today we celebrate your birthday. Nobody remembers this day, but everyone likes to celebrate it. I remember how I was born. I want to forget it. But today is different. A new man was born. And that makes me very happy. Happy birthday, Armand! May you play other songs with it. I'm a new man... Thanks! I want to give you something too. So you can always remember this day. Close your eyes. Now look! I call them "heavenly flowers". It?s so beautiful! I am sure they can even be seen from the other end of the world. Armand! Armand, are you there? Armand? Armand! Armand, where are you? Wake up. Be calm, it?s okay. I heard you scream, so I ran here. What happened? I had a bad dream. What does that mean? I never had dreams. What do they usually do? Sometimes, is what you are afraid of; And sometimes - is what you want. I'm very scared of the dragon, Armand. I was prepared for it all the time: the dragon... The dragon will never hurt you Mira. Never! I promise! Today a new man was born. Thanks to you. And he needs you... Good night, Armand! What? That means "goodbye" for the night. Good night, Armand. Goodnight Mira. When someone receives flowers, that person knows that is loved. This is a special bond between two people. Armand! There you are, Armand. Look! I did this. He looks like a dragon, but he can?t fly. Will you teach me to see the wind? You are strange, Mira. Why? - You are afraid of dragons, but you play with that. Why doesn?t Igor come for you? If he won?t come, you know what it means. - Did you marry him? We didn?t have time for that. The dragon came before. He probably won't come. I?ll teach you to see the wind. Close your eyes. Now look far into the distance. Closed eyes see the essentials. Feel the wind with your fingertips and hear him whisper. Feel how it flatters your skin. Then you will discover something in yourself that you never expected. He flew away. Armand! Armand, where are you? Did you try to escape? - There is no escape here. Can?t you sail? I call them "heavenly flowers." I am sure they can even be seen from the other end of the world. I'm very scared of the dragon Armand. and all the time I collected ... can even be seen from the other end of the world. I have a plan. I need to escape. Can you help me? I'm very scared of the dragon Armand... I need to escape. Can you help me? Can you hear me? Where are you? Armand! Go to the altar. Closer! Did you never wonder how is this an island where so many young women lost their lives. Not a single skeleton, not a single bone? You call us "dragons", but we call ourselves "born of the ashes". This is how...dragons are made. with the brides of the men. They don?t just kill her. They were burned alive. They filled them with fire and hold them while the brides scream in agony and the fire eats them up from the inside. Only smoldering ashes are left from them and a new dragon. That's how I was born. In this way, dragons continue their race. And that will happen to you too, Mira. Why are you telling me this? - I'm a monster. I will never live as humans do. That's not true.. - I know about the boat. But Armand, I ... - I understand now - You didn?t want to be in the cave. You wanted to escape. You had a plan: - "I'll I teach you to live like a human" You pulled the crates to find maps, supplies. you learned how to signals the ships. Something was missing... "Will you teach me to see the wind, Armand? " To overcome the spell of the island, which prevents you to sail. Armand, I didn?t think ... - I don?t blame you. That is better. You should be afraid of me. You said, I could defeat the dragon. I tried, but it has no sense, because you don?t believe i can. Armand! - Enough! At sunrise take your boat and set sail. The east wind will take you to the open sea. Where ships go. Don't go! What about the new man? Did you forget him? He needs me! Enough! I don't need you! I am just a dragon! Go away! Hey, ye, pigeons, hey ye, sivichki, sivokrilichki! Where have ye been, and away you? As you've seen? - What were Nee of razdyalushka, of proshtavanka - there in December soul with a body - white parted; Parted is He forgave, bitterly weeping; Parted, forgiveness, She wept bitterly: "How your body" in the land of smoldering, in the land of smoldering? And I - soul far to go ... Please! Please don't run after me! You are everything he has. Go back to him. Heavy sins and pretezhki - eternal torment are ... Igor, we have been sailing for days now through the fog, we will die. Let's row. Maybe we will find the island then. We have to make a decision. Alright, my decision is: The rocks! Calm down, we've pass them. To hell with the rocks and the fog! I have enough! Turn the ship. We turn back. Wait! Listen! I gave my word to your father before his death and i will not let the honor of the family ... Go and try to sleep. We carry out the search with out you. Yaroslava was right: you are nothing alike your grandfather. You don't even know his secret. Miraslavas big sister was right. She was right, you say? Do you want to marry her? You think, I don't know the secret? Shut up! Mira have to send a sign, you understand? Then we would know where to go. But if there is no sign, do you know what that means? It means that she's no longer alive! Did you understand that? So turn the ship now! We're going home. The Dragon! That's not the dragon. There is the sign. Mira! When the dragon took me, we're caught in a storm. He crashed into the cliffs and I was alone on the island. There were shipwrecks everywhere, and I had lucky enough to find this boat there. Thank you for saving me! Couldn't do it in any other way. Do you love me? Duchess, we are happy that you are safe, but we have to get to the island. That's not easy, but we have to make sure that the dragon is dead. No, the dragon doen't exist anymore. Please take me home, Igor. I don't want to go back. Of course but... Don't you forget whoom you speak with. Do as the Duchess says. The ships return to the harbor. Young women are married. Every story has an end. The boy couldn't become human and didn't want to be a dragon. What should he do? What should I do, Mira? You'll soon forget this nightmare, sister and start a new life. You gave me hope to make peace with myself. If only for a fleeting moment. But that was enough. There you are, my dear dragon slayer. Here, do you remember that? I grieved, because it reminded me the most important thing yet not said. Sometimes what happened seems like a dream. I only knew it from books so far, but i never really understood. Be with the one you love. Listen to your feelings and always with your heart. And the rest ... Fear not, Mira! The dragon will not hurt you. Never! He never flew before. You were right, Yaroslava. - Right? Why? I now understand what it means not being with the one you love. You were against our marriage, I remember that. That was foolish talk, sister. I thought you didn't love Igor and he just wanted to become Duke. But now I know it. You love each other. He found you. You told me, only true love led him to the island. Be happy, my sister! Then I will be too. Be happy, Mira! Goodbye! I can't go on like this. What are you doing, Mira? I don't love you. - What? I don't love you. Mira, I saved you. Please don't be foolish! I love the dragon! Be quiet! Help me draw! Come on! What is she doing, Igor? There was no time before no earth and no dust. She summons him! Mira, stop! Mira, he'll come to you! He will kill you! He'll kill us all! Time is a fast flowing river. He spares nobody. The bride is expecting her groom, while awaiting her fate. She is dressed in white, as if wrapped in a shroud. Eternal peace awaits you. The wedding bell rings Take her away! Take her away! Come! Come and get her! Fly! The young maiden is yours for all eternity Take her away. So that's, what your heart decided! Igor, don't you dare! Wait! You are used to being feared. But you do not know what it's like to be loved. Man or Dragon. I love you for what you are. Let it be as you wish. But please don't leave. Because I can't live without you. Stay with me for a while. So I get used to you. And so ends the story of the girl. She saved the dragon and gave to him, the most precious gift ever. Father. Father! What kind of gift? And where do dragon babies come from? Father! Where did I come from? Tell me! Alright. There was once ... Armand, what are you telling her? Sorry. I have told her this story so often, but she wants to know what happens next. What happens next? Then? Then the sky gave the dragon their children. But Mom, you can't fly. If you love someone with all your heart, do you know what you get then? What? - Then you get wings. And you can fly. Real wings? Real wings. Let's go. And you stay here and take care of her. I had stars to sanctify your time; I could ever to see your dreams! Sleep, dear child. Fly away, wind. I'll wait for you until the morning comes. I could sky black let me show you; I had waves you chandelier. I had the silence of the cradle where as ships swim dreams! Sleep, dear child. You're sailing to distant lands. I'll wait for you until the morning comes. Based on the novel "The Rite" Marina and Sergey Dyachenko.
