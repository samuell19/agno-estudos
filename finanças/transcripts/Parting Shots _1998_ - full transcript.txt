- It's cancer, Harry. What can I say? - I'm feeling fine most of the time. I walked three miles this morning. - Right, you have your good days. But the bad days will increase. Here's the specialist's report. - When do we start the treatment? - I have to tell you the truth. The cancer's so far vast, it wouldn't be much help. I'll give you a stronger painkillers. - So that's it is it? I just die? - Well, we all die, Harry. I'm sorry. (Harry exhales sharply) - So, how long have I got? - About six weeks. - Six weeks? - Maybe three or four more. Your father died of cancer, Harry. - He was 89. - You're unlucky, Harry. (Harry exhales sharply) - What do you think caused it? - It could be genetic, possibly stress. - Lisa. - You took that badly. - She made it bad. - Charlotte, what do you make out Mr. Sterndale's bill. Wouldn't have a check, would you? - I'll send it. - Thank you. I appreciate that. Call me anytime, Harry. Anytime. (birds chirping) What you're gonna do, Harry? - Well, I've got a wedding in half an hour. Life goes on, for a few weeks anyway. - You should put your affairs in order. Tie up those loose ends. - Thank you.

It's not the end of the world, mate! (indistinct chatter) - Thank you. Thank you. - He doesn't like weddings. Not since his wife left him. - My friend Bev lives two doors away says he lost all his money too. - Really? - And so I salute my friend, Mike a man with all the assets for a great wedding night. You won't have to pretend with him, Vanessa. I promise you that. - Stop him George. - How can I? - And I'd also like to include in my toast, the gloomiest, most miserable wedding photographer I've ever met, Harry. Harry Whatever! That's him. Yes! (people clapping) - It's not a funeral mate. - To the bride and groom, may true love prevail forever. - [Guests] To the bride and groom. (Soft music) - [Groomsman] You haven't got much luck tonight, mate. - [Groom] Yeah, we're gonna get this kit off first. - 11 pounds a print? Here I've ordered two on 11. Can I have a discount, Mr. Raphy? You've done enough business. - Why did you make me look so fat and old? - There's a shadow on my nose. I certain won't find any of these photographs. I look dreadful in all of them. (soft music) (paper shuffling) (soft music continues) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Harry. - It's quarter to one, Lisa. - We've been out. I'm not disturbing you, am I? (Harry sighs) - What do you want? - About tomorrow, we've got to make it earlier. Rick and I are going to The Polo. He's on a Vogue assignment. - How early, Lisa? - How about eight o'clock? - It's Sunday, it's nearly one o'clock, now. - Look Harry, we're doing you a favor. We're paying full price. - All right, Lisa. - Thank you, darling. (phone bangs) Come on Patsy. Bathy time. I'm going to make you buff on this photo, come on yours. (camera shutters) Patsy over here, look at mommy darling! Isn't she beautiful? (camera shutters) - Can we do some without the bow? - All naturale you mean? Nah, I think it's better to keep her dressed. Now take some of Patsy and me together. - Why couldn't Rick do this? - Oh, he's so creative. Such a production, it's all art to him. - Photographing Polo's art? - It is the way Rick does it. - So when do we get to see it then? Rick and the Polo set. - Ah, they've got a four month lead time. - Too late for me then, unless they send the photos in advance. - Quick, she's smiling. (Lisa laughing) What do you mean too late for you? Are you emigrating? - I'm dying, Lisa. - Ah, that's what you said when we split up, - I was in pain. - Stomachache. - It was more than that. - Get this. (Lisa laughing) She's kissing me. - How many more of these do you need? - You're right. We'll do some without the bow. Take care of this. Don't drop it. You're not really ill, are you? (toy squeaking) - It's cancer. They're give me six weeks to live. - My God. Get this. Get this. - I have to change the film. - Boop. Oh, Patsy's tired. Rick will be here in a minute. Do you think we've got enough? - 20 Rolls Lisa that's 240 shots. - Even with you, there's bound to be something we can use. - Thanks. - See our new car. He's making so much money. I'm surprised he's got any left after I redecorated the house. You're a love, Harry. - And you're a bitch, Lisa. - He took 250 Shots in one hour! You'd have taken three days. - Good on you, Harry. - You're not really serious about the cancer, were you Harry? - I was. - Just trying to get me back again, aren't you? You'll try anything. I love you, Harry, I really do. But it's all over. I'm happy with Rick now. (car horn honking) Coming! Come on Patsy. You were so lovely. (soft music) - Have you came into money? Did somebody die and leave you a fortune? - Somebody did die actually. - Who? - I don't wanna depress you John but I got cancer. I got six weeks left to live. - Tell me you're joking. - I wish I was. - Oh God. Oh God Harry I... (soft music continues) What are you gonna do. - I suppose I could go around the world? - When you're 40? - I'm still paying off that Layton disaster. - You can always use her credit cards. - It's a good idea. I wouldn't be around to pay the bills. - As your lawyer, I withdraw that suggestion. Oh, this is so unfair. I've known you since school. You are without a doubt, the most decent, honest, nicest chap I ever met - Ah, too nice. - What's wrong with being nice and keeping your word? - You lose. (dog barking) (soft music) - Get up! Stand up! - [School boys] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! - Get up! Look at Poopsie Poops! He'll never be anything! - [School boys] Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! - Stupid! (boys laughing) - I was right droopley. You are stupid. (Maurice laughing) - [Maurice] We should go into advertising, you and me, Harry. - [Harry Voiceover] You think so, Maurice? - [Maurice] Certainly you can draw, I'm good with the chat. It's perfect combination. (soft music) - What do you think of that Maurice? - It's very incomplete, Harry, it really is. - [Harry] What do you think of that Maurice? - It's on it's way, Harry. It needs a bit of a you know... - Should I suggest it? - Leave it with me overnight and I'll think about it. - I think I can help you. - You bastard! - This is terrific. It's quite amazing. - You know, sir, it's my idea but Harry Sterndale drew it up. He even added a bit here and there. - Oh, we're gonna have to redraw it anyway Maurice. It's the idea that comes across, not the artwork. - Thank you, sir. - It was my idea. I did it all. - Oh Harry, there's nothing less attractive than a young man trying to take credit for a colleague's work. - But-- - No buts, Harry. I don't like it. It's not the way we do things at WJS. I think you should consider your position. - What do you mean? - You're fired Harry. - [Maurice] I think you handled it wrong, Harry. - [Harry Voiceover] Didn't matter much, really. I did well, I became a photographer. (soft music) - These are fabulous, Harry. That's really super. Terrific. Shadow on the nose here. Nobody's made me look this good. - You do look good. You look fabulous. Can I take you out to dinner? - I asked her out to dinner. - [Harry Voiceover] That was some lousy wedding. Did it start to go wrong when she became a blonde? Or when she said I needed a financial advisor? - [Lisa] You need help Harry. Face it, you're not practical. - [Layton] Lisa, Harry, come and visit. What harm can it do? - 27%. - I'm telling you, Harry, you'll make at least 27% a year on your money. - But the banks are only giving 6%. - Do you think those idiots who run the banks know what I know? - Have they got a Bentley? A house in Marbella? A flat in the South of France? A mansion here in Hampstead? Harry, people with me grow rich. - Oh, I'd love a place in the South of France. - Well, I got 30,000 pounds in the bank. - You want my advice? Borrow another 20, make it 50. I'll double it in two years. - Look, his other clients are doing well, why shouldn't we? - You can't go wrong. - [Harry Voiceover] I lost everything. - [Lisa Voiceover] Oh God, Harry, everything? - [Harry Voiceover] Layton went free. And now I have to find more modest accommodation. - It's smaller than it looks in the photograph. Isn't there's something larger in the area. - It's all we can afford. - I can't believe you gave Layton our money. Good morning, I'm Mrs. Sterndale. It's very boring having a husband with a perpetual stomachache, Harry. It really is. I've told you to exercise. I've told you to diet! (Harry sighs) - I'll go see the doctor tomorrow. - I've been in this place three years and it's still revolting! (soft music) Our marriage was a disaster, Harry, face it. I'm going to shopping. If you can call it shopping, with the money you give me. Be back later. (soft music) (Patsy whining) (Lisa giggling) - Who was that? - Where? - In that red sports car? - What red sports car? - I've just seen you in a red sport car. - I've been shopping, darling. Took the bus. - Some bus. - We're leaving you Harry. - After nine years, why? - You're just not enough for me. - Is there somebody else? - Of course not! - I love you. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you. Please darling. Things will get better. - Let me go! (Patsy whining) (dramatic music) (door bangs) (doorbell ringing) - Who is it? - It's me, John. - John, it's 11:30. Is something wrong? - I couldn't stop thinking about you. Been looking back on things? - All my life's in those. - Yeah, I looked pretty good when I was young. - All the people I liked. All the people I loved. A lot of the people I ended up hating. - Don't give up. I had a friend, they said he was a goner. 10 years later, he's still alive. - Why should people be allowed to get away with it? - With what? - How many mothers, I mean, if your kid mugs, you know already, he gets sent down, right? - Maybe. - There are other ways of damaging people. It happens all the time. - Yeah. - [Harry] But it's just not right. - What are you getting at? - In there are all the people who mugged me. Screwed me over. - It happens to us all. - I think I should kill them. (John chuckles) - Absolutely Harry, you kill them. Kill them all. I'll go get the bag. - I'm a dying man, John. Tomorrow, I start to put all my affairs in order. - If I can help, let me know. - Affairs, in order. (imitates blasting gun) (guns blasting) - [Harry] Morning. - Depends on your perception of bad to call it good. But that's just me. - Can I get you something to drink? - Half a bitter please. Keep the change. (beer trickling) Saw this pub on TV last year. Very interesting program. - Work of art, not fact. - Said you could come in here, buy a gun. Just like that. The barmaid looked a lot like you. - Amazing what they can do is make up these days. - It's good to serve the needs of the community. - Who are you? - I'm dying of cancer. (paper shuffling) I need a quick way out. - Is this is for real ? - I'm afraid so. - Stress it's a killer. I bet stress caused it. We all need to bring a little more calm into our lives. Our value is all upside down. - Tell me about it. - We should all be a little nicer to each other. Be responsible for our actions. That's some karma entering. How about alternative Indian therapy. I know a guru in Sri Lanka. - It's too late for that. - Death is merely the end of a particular journey. Your spirit will move on. Be reborn. - Look, I need some help. - Best I can do is a Beretta nine millimeter with an extra clip, first timer hair trigger. - I'll need lots of ammunition. 40 rounds. - 40 rounds to commit suicide? - I might miss. (oriental music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hey, darling it's me. - Do you know what time it is? - Same time as you phoned me last Sunday. - That was an emergency. It's Harry. - Ugh, I don't believe it. - Are you drunk? - I'm happy, the photos look wonderful. - Rick has to go to Paris, first thing in the morning. You've woken him up. - [Harry] I'll bring the photos around at 11:00. - Okay. You sound very odd. - What do you mean. - Different. Happy. - I am happy. I love the pictures. I'll see you tomorrow. (upbeat music) (car engine starting) (doorbell ringing) (upbeat music continues) - You're late. - Eight minutes. - Time is time. 11 is 11. (upbeat music continues) What's so wonderful about these? - That's a good one. - No, sorry. So, what's this? - Read it. (paper shuffling) (Lisa gasps) - My God. It's true. You do have cancer. (Lisa gasps) Harry, I'm so sorry. Oh, look at that shadow. It makes my nose look enormous. I'm sorry it didn't work out, Harry, you and me. I hope you don't blame me. - You did go off with Rick when you found out I was ill. - We thought it was digestive troubles. Things weren't going well. - I thought they were. - So many problems. - You never told me. - Then you lost our money. You're not even with us now we're trying to get it back. Oh my God, six weeks. (Harry sighs) - At most. I told you at the studio. Didn't you tell Rick? - Oh, I didn't wanna bother him. He was so busy. - You always said you'd push me around in a wheelchair when I got old. - I meant it! - Well, I won't be old. - You know, I always loved you. I never stopped. - And why did you go off with Rick? - Oh, we'd always argue. The photos are wonderful. You pick the best. I'll give you this. All this. Oof all that. These. - He was richer, wasn't he? - I bored you for Christ sake, showed on your face. You could wait to talk to your friends. - That's not true. - Bloody well is. Our meals you couldn't wait to talk to the waiter. - I could have changed, if only you told me. - How many mistakes can you make, Harry? The business was going. No one wanted your photographs. You didn't grow as a human being. Then you lost our money. I mean, look at you now, what are you? A bloody wedding photographer. (dramatic music) What's that? - It's a gun. I bought it. - Don't shoot yourself. Not here please. - I'm not gonna shoot myself, Lisa. - Oh, I understand the pain, the desire to end it all sooner rather than later. - I'm gonna shoot you Lisa. - What? - I'm gonna shoot you because you walked out on me for no reason. You walked out on me without giving me one chance. For weeks after if I'd have had this gun I'd have shot myself. Things are different now. (Patsy whining) - Oofie Patsy. (Harry sighs) - Never trust people who love dogs. They never have anything left for anyone else. (dramatic music) Bye-bye Lisa. - I love you Harry. I'll come back. You'll get better you'll see. You and me, the old team, we can do it. Oh you have a shot. - One bang. Calm as firing. Why should I care? I've got nothing to lose. - It's just a joke, isn't it? - It's not a joke, Lisa. But you wouldn't understand. - I wouldn't understand? What about you? You pathetic moron. What sort of a man are you barging in and threatening a defenseless woman? I could have had a heart attack! I bet it's not even a real gun. (dramatic music continues) I'll tell you something Harry, there's a reason people like you get cancer. They deserve to die! (gun blasting) (soft music) (Patsy whining) (soft music continues) (upbeat music) - Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. (soft music) (cheerful music) (paper shuffling) (spoon clinking) (indistinct public address announcement) (door banging) (doorbell ringing) (door knocker banging) - I'm sure it's for a good cause. - Mr. Sterndale. - Yeah. - We've got bad news for you. It's your wife, sir, she's dead. (cheerful music) - Would you like a glass of champagne? - No thanks. - She was murdered, sir. - Really works this, you know? Putting the spoon in the top, it keeps the bubbles. - Would you mind turning the music down a bit, sir? You don't seem very upset. - She was a very aggravated woman. I suppose Rick did it. - Why should he? - He lived with her. - Is that a motive? - Don't you wanna kill your wife sometimes? - I'm divorced. - Were you at Mrs. Sterndale's house this morning, sir? - I took the photos of her and the dog around. - Oh yes. We saw them. There was an odd shadow on her nose. - Ray. - Suppose I'll never get paid now. - You're taking this very casually, sir. - That's because you didn't know Lisa. - When did you leave? - About 11:15. - Did she have any enemies? - Not that I know of. She was always very nice in public. - So I heard feelings between you and your wife were hostile. - If there were, would I be taking photographs of her on a Sunday? Delivering them to her on a Monday? Since we parted we've got on rather well. - Can you think of anything that might assist us in our inquiry, sir? - No. - Where did you go after you left your wife? - I came back here, went for a walk. Am I a suspect? I find that quite exciting. - So you can't think of anything else? - There is one thing. - Yes. What's that? - Will, you gave me back my five pounds? (cheerful music continues) Thank you. (door banging) - Well, what do you think? - He's a nutcase. I can see why she left him. But I don't think he's a murderer. (indistinct chatter) - Harry, tell me it wasn't you. - It wasn't me. (John sighs) - Thank God for that. - I was lying. - What? - I did it. I murdered Lisa. - You're joking. - I'm joking. (John sighs) - Thank God for that. - I wasn't joking really, it's true. I shot her. - Oh, come on, you haven't got a gun. - I have now. - where'd you get it? - Pub. - Paid with a packet of peanuts, was it? (both laughing) Thanks. - John I've been coming here 20 years, I've always had a bottle of Chateau, Margaux 61, a thousand pounds a bottle. Today we celebrate. - What do we celebrate? - I becoming a murderer. It's a joke. Just killing. I mean, kidding, John. To Lisa (glasses clinking) who led the way. (indistinct chatter) (glass smashing) - Harry, if you did it, I don't wanna know, but if you did it and I know how Lisa totured you, if you did it, Harry, don't do that again. (John laughing) - John, you're a lawyer. You shouldn't be laughing at a time like this here. - You're right. (both laughing) Do you know what I'd like? (both laughing) - You know what John? You're the only real friend I ever had. - I'd like to get laid. - If you want to real beauty, you shall have one. (soft music) What do you think then, John? (upbeat music) - [John] Oh, look at that. - Which one do you want? (doorbell ringing) - Let's get this money thing out of the way. - Let's do it. - That'll do nicely. - This your wife? - Harry's ex. - Hmm she's got a shadow on her nose. - Good luck. - Enjoy. - He will. - Just a minute. Can you play it backgammon? - You're not very good at this, are you? - That was... Thank you. - You're nice. - You wouldn't believe, I've ever had that before. We played backgammon all night. - Well I... - Wouldn't believe it. We played backgammon all night. - I don't believe you. - We did. I lost 206 pounds. (door bangs) Does Gerry Layton deserve to live? - Of course he does. - He conned you. He robbed me. He was responsible for the breakup of my marriage. - He was convicted. Paid the penalty. - 18 months, community service for stealing 75 million pounds? - The man's ruined Harry, please. (soft music) - He's got a 2 million pound house. He has holidays in the South of France. His kids go to all the best schools. And he's supposed to be bankrupt. - A bullet is not the answer. (soft music continues) - Not bullet. - What do you mean you're canceling my membership? You were pleased enough to see me when I was paying in thousands in the good times! (phone bangs) (doorbell ringing) Jill! Darling! The door! If it's the press, I'm in Cyprus! (footsteps approaching) (door opening) - Yes. - Good morning. I've-- - [Layton] Who is it! - I've come to-- - It's a man to mend my computer! Follow me. (footsteps approaching) (door banging) - You're spotty, you're fat and you're still eating junk. - Leave her alone, Gerry! We're going out! - Shopping I suppose. That's all you ever do. Shop! Shop! Shop! - I have trouble fixing the light bulb let alone a computer. - I know, Harry. - How is it? - Harry Sterndale. 50,000 pounds lost. Wife left. Business collapsed. - I'll be in the pool. Take messages. And he's supposed to be working! - I'm going out for half an hour. I'll need the computer when I get back. (cheerful music) (water splashing) (cheerful music continues) - Is this is how you make computers? Get off my land! - Of your wife's land. - Get out of my house! - Your wife's house. (water splashing) - Who are you? What do you want? Have I seen you before? - I'm number 639. - You're crazy. - That was my client account number with you. - My business was a victim of recession, like so many others. If you lost, I'm truly sorry. - Yeah, you look it. - If you need money, maybe my wife could lend you some. - Would she bail out the other 700 people that you ruined? - Well, we could work something out. - I'm sure we can. (water splashing) (cheerful music) All right can I pay you for half of this pool? It's only fair that we should share it and you can have the bottom half. (cheerful music) (dramatic music) Go on. I've only got six weeks to live. - I know. (water splashing) - Can I get out. - Sure. (water splashing) I only brought this in case he fought back. In case he didn't sink. - Who are you? - Jill Saunders. I am, I was Mr. Layton's PA. In 20 minutes, I'll find him dead. It won't be unexpected. He had heart trouble. ♪ It's in the smile ♪ It's in the face ♪ It's in the way she looks ♪ At you ♪ You wonder why (siren blaring) ♪ You wonder how ♪ This crazy feeling ♪ Should happen to you now ♪ And as you go ♪ It's all you know ♪ It's in the smile Heart attack, he had a lot of problems. - Ah, haven't we all? Do you want a lift? (car door opens and shuts) (soft music) (car door shuts) - You can come in. Milk and sugar? - Both. - I served with Layton for 12 years. Not a nice man. - Took you 12 years to find out? - He was fine at first. I even got my parents to give him their savings. They lost everything. My father committed suicide. - I'm sorry. Why did you stay on? - The police found him. I helped. They were shattered when the lawyers did a deal and Layton got off. - And you still stayed on? - Some of the people he cheated want another go they're planning a private prosecution. I copy documents. That's how I met your wife. - Lisa. She said she was gonna do something. - Rick was helping finance the attack. I was at her house just after you. I heard the shot. - So you knew. - She was a cunt. She was cheating on Rick. She left you. She even stole some of the money collected to prosecute Layton. Anyway, she told me, you only had six weeks to live. What's the point of turning you in? If evil people get what they deserve, why should I care? - That's not politically correct. (Jill laughs) - So what? (soft music) - [Harry] I've been looking for somebody like that all my life. Now my life's over. - Did you make love? (Harry laughs) - She was having dinner with her mother. Have I got life insurance? - You know you have. - She really suffered. Her and her family. I wanna leave her everything. - After one cup of coffee? - Two. - Strong coffee, - She gets 50,000 pounds if you die. - Is that all? - If you died violently it's 300,000. - I don't get it. - That's the sort of pitch to get you in. But come on, they offer a large amount for something that's highly unlikely to happen. - What does that mean? If you die violently. - Well, it's also here. Murder, killed during robbery, riot, earthquake, plane crash, that sort of thing. - So if I get murdered, Jill gets rich. - It looks like it. Thanks. Oh my God. (paper shuffling) - Heart attack. He drowned. It's nice to have some good news at last. (door opening) Our fist date. - You bought this? - For the night. - If I'd known I'd have dressed up. - I thought you had. (car door shuts) (cheerful music) - I think you'll find the oysters a wise choice. I hope you enjoy your evening with us. - Thank you. - How lovely to see you. Lord Selwyn and Ladyship, please follow me. You two, wait. (indistinct chatter) - We have a reservation. Harold Sterndale. - How do you spell that? - S-T-E-R-- - I'm afraid it's not here, sir. - Let's go somewhere else. - Car is not back for two hours. I phoned myself yesterday. - I'm afraid, sir we don't have your booking. We're completely full. The table is at a request. (soft music) Follow me, sir. (cheerful music) - Have you got anywhere a little bit more-- - You were lucky to get in at all. - I love it. More convenient if I need to pee. (cheerful music continues) - At least the food should be terrific. (Harry sighs) (cheerful music continues) Waiter! Waiter! Waiter! This is the first day right about all the time. Chef's supposed to be crazy. - You went mad waiting to be served. - Please sir, don't do that. - Are you serving food? - I'll bring the menu. Would you like a drink? - Let's see the wine list. - Certainly madame. (indistinct chatter) - May I? - Of course. Anything you like? - We'll have the Meso 1982 and the Chateau Lafite 61. They're very expensive. - Good. - What is madame eating? - How would I know? We can't even get a menu. - It's usual to choose the wine as an enhancement to the food. (indistinct chatter) - Thank you sir. - What is (speaks in foreign language) - It's one of Renzo's specialties. - But what is it? - It's confit chicken lightly braised in dill and fennel. Baked in the low heat for 15 minutes. Brushed with olive oil and garlic. Roasted for another 17 minutes. Stuffed with the mint oils, olives and truffles and decorated with a sabayon sauce and orange peel grated with white sugar and honey. - I suppose a filet of steak is out of the question. - Can I have mine well done? - Renzo does not serve any meat well done. You can have it, senor. - I'll tell you what. You order. We'll live with it. - A sensible solution, sir. - Was that wise? - We'll see. That'll be fine. - Not very friendly, are they? (indistinct chatter) (waiter slurping) (cheerful music) (wine trickling) (cheerful music continues) - Yes. (cheerful music continues) - Renzo created this in 1986, during his (speaks in foreign language) (cutlery clattering) (cheerful music continues) - This is awful. - Waiter. Waiter! This is ridiculous. What little there is of it. Do you do smoked salmon? - I'll speak to Renzo. - This isn't going very well, is it? - There's a terrific place near my apartment. You can even recognize what you're eating. (indistinct chatter) - You! You! Out! - We only asked for smoked salmon. - We create excellence here. We don't slice fish. - This was supposed to be a very special evening for us. You and your people-- (utensils clattering) (Renzo screaming) - You know nothing about food, about life, about creation, about art, about color, about dignity. You're total illiterate. Get out both of you! You and disgusting dressed bimbo! Out. - We're leaving. We get the drift. - How dare you complain about the food, sir! You didn't even have a reservation. (bones cracking) - Enjoy. - A new start. - To an unforgettable night. (soft music) - I have to go. - Just as I've decided to devote myself entirely to you? - I know it's not very sporting. There's something I've got to do. - Are you sure? - You'll understand. - I will? - This day here to deny-- I don't care all night. That's where you belong in dustbin. You come to fight with me? Stupid. - I wouldn't fight with you. You're taller than me and you're stronger than me. (Renzo laughs) (dramatic music) You know nothing about kindness. You know nothing about decency. You know nothing about respect, manners, civility, courtesy. - I can learn. - Too late. (gunshot blasting) (dramatic music continues) (dog barking) - Where did you go? - I had something I had to say to the chef. - What was it? - Goodbye. - You're so naughty Harry. (door bangs) (soft music) - Everyone loved him. We were like brothers. But don't believe what you heard about him. - Did he have many enemies? - Hundreds. - Anything out of the ordinary happened tonight? - No. - No Rouse? No one thrown out? - That was a minor incident. - Go on. - Renzo attacked a customer with a knife. He's done it before. Only three of them got damaged. - Tonight's lucky winner, that was his name? - Sterndale, that was the name. I wrote Sterndale. (soft music) - I love you. - Sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Can you get a move on you've only got five weeks left. - I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. I can't believe it. Oh definitely and you Ray? - Thanks Ron. I've just be talking to Ronnie Wallace who's on the Renzo murder. Guess who Renzo attacked last night? - Who? - Harry Sterndale. Renzo was shot with the same gun that killed Sterndale's wife, Lisa. - Would I believe it? (bird chirping) - Are you still here? Didn't miss, did you? - You're going to find something else I need? - Oh, well, we're all looking for something else. That all elusive, something. There's something that prevents happiness. - You never give up, do you? - The something I'm looking for is a little bit more practical. (siren blaring) - Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! - You two follow me! (dog barking) watch the back Keith! (dog barking) (door knocker banging) (doorbell ringing) - Break it down! Go! Go! Go! Go! (cheerful music) - You really think he leaves a gun here. (objects clattering) (police radio chatter) - Who's the mark? Beg your pardon. - Who exactly do you wish me to kill dear boy? - Me. (police radio chatter) (dog whining) - Look at his doctor's letter. - Only six weeks to live. - Yeah, and that was a week ago. - How many more do you think he'll take with him? - I want it to be quick. I don't wanna know anything about it. - Tell me, why don't you kill yourself? - I'm dying of cancer. My insurance policy caries, violent deaths clause. If I become a victim of crime, I get a lot money. - Why should you care? I mean, when you're dead, you're dead, aren't you? - I've fallen in love. I wanna make sure she's all right. - His address book, sir. - Take it. - Yeah, look at this. - So, he owes money with Layton. - Who isn't? - Shut up. - Shut up. - Here. - Layton was found dead in his swimming pool two days ago. - We all know that. (beer trickling) - Just phone Freda here when you're ready. Let her know your address. Tell her your movements. Make it easier. - How much? - 5,000. Cash of course. - I'll get the money here later today. - It's a deal then. - Good guy, Jamie. Very reliable. - I hope so. - So what're you gonna do afterwards? - What do you mean afterwards? - Well, when Jamie's done his gig? - I'll be dead. - Yeah, but have you got a spiritual guide? Someone to meet you in the afterlife, take you through the border into the other world. - Don't tell me. You know a good one. - Well, for 300 quid I can make a few calls. (Harry laughing) - He's coming out the corner now, sir. - Right. (car engine revving) (dog barking) - Are you all mad? - The same gun that killed your wife, killed Renzo Locateli last night. The autopsy report on Layton showed bruising to his head. We think he was held down in the pool. - So? - A van similar to yours was seen near Layton's house the day he died. - Do you have any fingerprints? Have you found anything here? Do you have the gun? Got any witnesses? You come in here, wreck my house. I'm a dying man, for Christ sake. With no honor, no respect, but certainly no evidence! Get out! - We're going to have to bring him in for 72 hours. After that, if we don't charge him he's out. We do need more evidence. - We'll put a 24-hour watch on him. - Yeah. (dramatic music) Keep observation you're at the front and you're at the back. We'll send some men to join you. - Not much point in that, sir. - I'm in charge do it. - I will if you insist, sir, but he's just walked down the back alley. - Well, get after him! (train roaring) (bus engine revving) (dramatic music continues) (train doors shutting) (dramatic music continues) (train roaring) - 11000 pounds, sir. - Can I have another 3000 on this please? (soft music) - Allow me sir. (soft music) - How will you be paying, sir? - Cash. - I'm afraid I need a deposit. (door creaking) - I wonder how many serial killers stay at The Majestic? - Is that what I am? - I wouldn't let it get you down. So was Wilde, Robin Hood, every war hero. They handout medals for what you're doing. - That's very philosophical. (soft music) For you. - How did you pay for this? - If cancer doesn't get me American Express will. - I believe in miracles. I think you'll live. - Out of the question. I couldn't afford it. (Jill laughing) - 38 men at the suspect's house and he walks through. - Very circumstantial evidence, Commissioner. We put a tap on his lawyer's phone. Checked his credit cards. He's bought a sports car. - I think he killed the wife. She was fiddling the Layton victim's legal fund. Layton, one of the biggest crooks we ever didn't get. Renzo, we have a good loony chef. Though I'll say one thing for Sterndale. - Yes. - A few more like him and we'll be out of a job. - The Aldbury Hotel, three miles down here, first right you can't miss it. - Thank you officer. - Have I seen you before, sir, on television? - I was on Blind Date ones, but I lost. (cheerful music) (car engine revving) - We've taken the top page of Harry Sterndale's notepad. And that what he's written on the page above. - The Hornet's Nest Hackney. - Well, that's a gun pub, isn't it? (cheerful music) - Glad you gave me the car. Think I'll ever get to drive it? (Jill laughing) - Just helped a couple. I'm sure I recognized the man. He said he wasn't on a telly. You know these celebrities like to be anonymous. - How did you know this place? - A friend of mine lives here. I stayed with him once. - Are we going to meet him? - He was the school bully. Evil bastard! Made my life hell for years. - Nice sport. (Freda sighs) - There's a sad and desperate man. Look at that face. I mean, look at that face. That is an angry face, officer. That face needs help. - Yes. Yes. But has he been here? - I can't say. So many faces, so much anger, so much frustration. Don't you feel? Don't you feel so hopeless? Sometimes like a small drip in a sea of sadness. - Freda Armstrong. - That's me. - Sign here. - Excuse me. (paper shuffling) Good old Harry. Pay's up. Did you say Harry Sterndale? - Yes. - Yes. - Never heard of him. - Here's to it then. (glasses clinking) (soft music) (men laughing) - Barman! We might be a while! Drinks all round! Drinks for my friends! - Yes, I'll have a pint of brandy, please my good friend! And a cigar! - [Patrons] Barman! Barman! Barman! Barman! (dramatic music) - You know, I think I've just seen someone I was in school with! - I was at school with you. - No! Not you. I mean, someone else! Come on I'll show you! (men laughing) Harry Sterndale! I used to know him! We used to call him Poopsie! I don't believe it Poopsie lives! Hello Poopsie! Hello Poopsie! - Poopsie! - Hey Poopsie! - Come on Poopsie! - Come on let's go. - Hey Poopsie! - He's insane! - Go Poopsie! - Don't want my seat to get wet. (dramatic music) - What a surprise! Poopsie! Oh, little Poopsie! I never thought I'd see you again! - And Poopsie's friend! What's a nice girl like you were doing with a dickhead like that! - Leave it all. - Care for another drink! - Come along darling, let's have a drink! - You won't have drink with an old school chum? - Hey! That's insulting! - Pretty little swot! - Pretty and pissy! - Oh look, he's wetting your car! That's not very nice, is it? - Oh, lets enjoy ourselves for heaven's sake. - But you don't mind, do you? - I don't mind Graham. (cheerful music) (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) - That's your kids', isn't it? - Sorry about last night. Things got a bit out of hand. - All cleaned. - Only a bit of fun. Nothing to lose any sleep over. - I was coming to see you anyway. - Oh yes, what for? - This and that. - Forgive me, I've got to... - I was hoping we could have a chat. (horses neighing) - Did you come for money? I hear you lost everything to that Layton crook. - Not money. (wind howling) - Look, why don't you and your girl come for lunch aye, no hard feelings. - In school, you made my life a misery for years. - Oh, come on. Nobody cares! - I do. - The fact is Harry you're inadequate. Always were, always will be. Don't blame me. Look at the mirror. - That's not very nice. - No, the truth seldom is. - You know why I came here today? - I don't care. - I came here to kill you. - Ha! Well, you'll have to catch me first. - No I won't. (dramatic music) (gunshot blasting) (dramatic music continues) (birds chirping) - That's it. (dramatic music) (door knocker banging) - Come in.

That's his wife. - Oh, you silly woman you ruined the picture! - Do you have a package for me please? - Sir. - Thank you. It's getting near the end. - The beginning, the end, life is just a few steps in between. - Will you ever have a normal conversation? - Well, it depends what you mean by a normality. Normal to some is a flight through the clouds to others. It's like fish for example. The under sea world is normal. Life through water. Incredible. - Give that to Jamie. - Is this the shooter? Dangerous to bring it back. The police were here. - Tell him, use it on my job. - That'll be extra 500 quid. - I thought as much. - Look on it as a spiritual investment. - I'll try. (water trickling) You know, when I left Cambridge, my only major ambition was to succeed in advertising. - Then you got a brain. - I was passionate about it. I joined Dusky, Lynette Crowder, then. - Heard of them. - Managing director, thanks to me Mr. Maurice Walpole. - What did he do to you? - You see this ad, all my idea. - Did you get royalties? - I got fired. - Why? - Maurice Walpole. - You turned in the gun. What's he gonna die of? Food poisoning? (cheerful music) (car engine revving) - There you go. - Thank you. - Yes. - Harry Sterndale for Mr. Walpole. - What company are you from? - I'm not from a company. I'm just passing by. - He doesn't see people without an appointment. - Why not ask him? (exhales sharply) - Alright, take a seat. Vanessa, there's a Harry Sterndale here says he wants to see Maurice. Oh, of course. Mr. Sterndale, please go up. It's on the sixth floor. - Harry, darling. Oh, how are you? - I'm fine Nessy. You're still looking as good as ever. - 17 years, Harry. What have you been doing? - I'm still a photographer. - Sounds exciting. Guess who it is, Maurice? Harry Sterndale. - [Maurice] Send him in, Nessy. - Go through. (door opening) - Harry! This is terrific! Look, I got a big meeting in five minutes, but come on in. Great to see you! A blast from the past! Hey, do you want to drink? - No thanks. - Oh, sit down, sit down. - This is all very elegant. - Well, if you'd stayed with us, this could have been you. - If you hadn't nicked my idea, this could have been me. - Harry, we all remember things differently. Don't think I haven't worked for this. You know, I'm up six o'clock every morning, weekends, bank holidays. - Must be hell. - Hell it is Harry believe me! Absolute hell! - I have been lucky photographing weddings and dogs. - Well, we're always looking for photographers. We'll try and to use you. - You'd use me? - Well, we'll try, you know, I mean really hard. - Don't over exert yourself, Maurice. - Look Harry if you've come around here to resurrect some grudge, I mean look, if it's money, you can rely on me, okay? - Have you no conscience? - This is advertising. (Maurice laughing) Now, jolly up Harry! Come on, jolly up! - I'm dying of cancer. (Maurice laughing) - Sorry. Sorry. I mean, that was inappropriate. Yes. Well, hard to jolly up then, really. You know the Runnymede Cancer Fund Campaign? - No. - We got to go so that I can get a couple of guns at D&AD. Terror in New York, fantastic campaign, that was. So, I mean, you're looking well. I mean, you've lost weight, haven't you? - How long have you been running my campaign? - Oh, well, nearly 30 years I suppose. - That could have changed my life. I'm gonna kill you Maurice. - Ha! Harry baby! You said that when you were fired. (watch ringing) Whoops. Well, Betty and I would love to see you sometime. We got a great house down by the river, you know. - I've seen it. - What? You have? - It was in a magazine. I was down there so I checked it out. - Really? Well, Betty still talks about you, you know. - I haven't seen Betty since you pinched her off me. - Really? Is that right? Well, well, well. - Does she know you're still knocking off Nessy? (Maurice laughing) - Well, great to see you. Now, just great to see you. Just been great seeing you! - You kill me, Maurice. - No. You kill me, remember? (Maurice laughing) (door bangs) Jesus Christ! Oh! (dramatic music) - You wait up there. (dramatic music continues) - No, I don't wanna get murdered. You're killing me. (Maurice snoring) (fuel trickling) (dramatic music continues) - [Reporter] This is the BBC News at 6:00 am. The President of Petrusca arrived to day with... (alarm clock ringing) (dramatic music continues) - [Reporter] For a state visit that remains extremely contentious. Human rights groups have been demonstrating outside the Petruscan embassy throughout the week. Further demonstrations against Donatelli Zlomov are expected at his hotel. (dramatic music continues) - What are you dong here, miss? - Admiring the view. - What view? - I love hedge rows. (dramatic music continues) (tires screeching) - What was that for? - Remember that fax about a girl? Car seven to base. (dramatic music continues) (siren blaring) (tires screeching) Ms. Saunders. (dramatic music continues) (car door bangs) (dramatic music continues) (fire crackling) (car blasting) We have Ms. Saunders. - Stay with her! (car blasting) (dramatic music) (car blasting) (fire crackling) (glass shattering) (siren blaring) - Run, Harry run! (officer screaming) (dramatic music continues) - Where is Harry Sterndale? - Who? - Ms. Saunders, you were just at the Aldbury Hotel with him. I suggest you let him into your employer's house shortly before Mr. Layton was drowned. You were also recognized at Renzo's Restaurant two hours before the chef was killed. - You've got me. I know him. - Where is he? - I've been in a police car for the last three hours. - This is not a frivolous matter, Ms. Saunders. Five people have been murdered. Your friend is wanted for murder. You're an accomplice. - Then charge me. - You help us, we help you. - What is there to help? Harry will be dead in a couple of weeks. You fight against evil, but your hands are tied. How many people who deserve punishment ever get it? If Harry killed anyone, it's because they killed a little bit of him. I call that justice. (phone ringing) (car engine revving) (car door shuts) (doorbell ringing) - Can I come in? - We've got a dinner party. - I'm dying, Phil. (indistinct chatter) (soft music) Who has dinner in flavor and dressed these days? - We do. - Every night? - You have pain, Harry. - It's getting worse. - I'll get you to the hospital. - Ah, just get us some stronger pills. - I'm sorry, Harry. The police came round. You've done anything wrong? - I'm just putting my affairs in order. - Ah. - Can I make a local call, Phil? - Of course. - Forgive me, my guests... (soft music) - John, it's me. Listen, they've arrested Jill. Find her where she is. And no matter how much it costs, get her out. (siren blaring) (door opening) - I liked what you said. - About rough justice? - Personally I'd shoot a lot of them. The rapists, the murderers. - Thugs who knock old women about with iron bars. - Child abusers. - Drug dealers. - Drunk drivers. - Parking offenders, people who drop litter. - Well, not everyone. - I love him, you know, Inspector, I really do. - I'll get you a cup of tea. (phone ringing) - I believe you're holding Jill Saunders. I'm her solicitor. - You want to see her? - What's your charge then? - She's here for questioning. - You've got 72 hours from arresting her to charging her. Otherwise you'll have to release her. - Two days to go. - Think you can make it? - Take Mr. Fraser to cell six. - Follow me, sir. (phone ringing) - She's more useful to us out anyway. - Do you think she'll lead us to Sterndale? - Of course she will. As long as we don't lose her. (phone ringing) - Hello, is Freda there? - I'll just get her. - Hello. - It's Harry Sterndale. Tell our friend it's time. He can find me at the Majestic Hotel or somewhere around there. - Absolutely. See you in the next life. - In the next life? - Yeah, The Next Life. You know, new pub in the Bulls Pond Road. - Oh. - President Zlomov's controversial lunch with the Queen tomorrow has not been canceled... - I wonder why they let me go. Hey, we look good together. - While it lasts. - What's that shadow on my nose? - She's gone into suite 318 at The Majestic. (car engine revving) (dramatic music) (Harry screaming) - I've only had a tablet. - I'll get help. This is suite 318. Get an ambulance. - Man in suite 318, what's his name? (siren blaring) (dramatic music continues) - I've come to see Harold Sterndale. - Your name? - Roger Harold Brown. - 318. - This is your fault, I hope you're satisfied now! - You shot him? - I'm a police officer! Who are you? - I'm a tourist. (dramatic music) - The man's dying, he doesn't need you! - Too bad. (siren blaring) - I should have charged more. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) - Ray. Ray! He's waking up. (dramatic music) (dramatic music continues) - What happened? - They operated. - I don't wanna fight it. - Harry, you haven't got cancer. - What? - The lab mixed up your x-rays with someone else's. You have a terrific claim for damages for distress. Insurers will pay out like a shot. Get rich. - There's nothing wrong with you. - So why did they operate on me? - You had an ulcer. The symptoms are the same. (dramatic music) - Morning. - I'm sure I've seen him somewhere before. - I don't believe it. I've seen everything. - I think not. - Wonderful news, isn't it? - We've got a lot of questions to ask both of you. - Who's that? - No! - It's not about my first wife again, is it? - You know what it's about, Harry. - You'll be in separate holding cells. So say goodbye, miss. - No, no, no, no,, no. - What? - It's gone far enough. I'll tell you everything. (Ray screaming) (dramatic music) - Come on Harry, let's go. (dramatic music continues) I'm a doctor! You're cured! - [Patient] No! You're taking my chair! (dramatic music continues) - Bit of coincidence, it's a nine millimeter. (dramatic music) - Taxi! (dramatic music) (car engine revving) Majestic Hotel Manchester Square. - [Harry] Will you write a postman. - Amazing what they pay postal workers today. - They've just gone back to the suite at The Majestic. - Very odd. - He's dressed as a postman. - I don't care if he's dressed as a gorilla. Make sure he doesn't leave the hotel. - Look at this. This is the bullet taken from your arm an hour ago. Same markings as this, which came from Cleverley. This from the chef Renzo and this from Lisa, Sterndale. All from the same gun. - Doesn't help our case much, does it? - It certainly won't when we have to reveal this information to his defense. - To you. (glasses clinking) You're rich and you're free. - I love you. I can't tell you how much. We've got nowhere to go. - Why? - I killed five people. - They can't prove it. - I didn't even try to be discreet. What am I gonna do? Go to South America? Move from one sleazy bar to the next? - I'll go with you. - Something's gonna happen soon. I'll go out like a shot and you'll be rich. - You mean the bullet in the hospital? - Next time he won't miss. - You're crazy. - I'll be crazy if you spend 30 years in jail. What kind of life would that be for you? Stop it, Harry. - It's to do with my insurance. If I go this way, you get taken care of. - I don't care about money. Call him, Harry, just call him. - Okay, darling. - I can't believe you did this. (soft music) - Is that you, Fred? Tell Jamie to forget it. I don't have cancer. He can keep the money. Just don't do the job. Get him on his mobile before it's too late. - Harry, where are you? What was all that about? Harry? - Well, everything's all right now. - You idiot. I love you. - [Demonstrators] Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! - I still can't believe you'd have yourself killed just for me. - I'd do more. - How? - Get married. - Us? - Let's get the ring. (Jill laughing) - [Demonstrators] Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! - I hope you're not planning to leave the hotel. - Just down the road. - He wants to buy an engagement ring. - Oh my days. (car engine revving) - [Demonstrators] Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! (dramatic music) - Could you wait a second, sir. The President of Petrusca is just leaving. - Surely I can go out and buy my fiance a ring. (dramatic music) - [Demonstrators] Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! (demonstrators shouting) (cameras shuttering) - President Zlomov has just appeared. He will be leaving shortly for his controversial lunch with the Queen. In a move that will no doubt be marred by the thousands of protesters that have gathered here-- - What about the human rights violations in Petrusca? - It will be an honor to meet your Queen. And then I must go shopping. - And could you tell us about the millions of dollars supposedly missing from your children's hospital campaign? - I need some new shoes. Three new ball gowns. Some new handbags. Some money. - [Demonstrators] Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! Down with Zlomov! (gun blasting) (First lady screaming) (gun blasting) - In the Press! - [Reporter] The President has been shot. It's chaos here in Central London as aides rush to the side of... - I'm very sorry, Charles. Obviously the message didn't get through. - Go on, go and buy the girl a ring. - [Reporter] Hunt for the perpetrator has been pitched. He's lying assumedly dead-- - He did it! I saw him! - [Demonstrators] Zlomov must go! Zlomov must go! Zlomov must go! Zlomov must go! Zlomov must go! Zlomov must go! (dramatic music) - Not again. I don't believe it. Me and the president. - This gun gets around. It won't help staying silent. You shot the president. It was on television. It's the most damning evidence I've ever seen. - Your gun was used on other murders, Jamie. You shot Mrs. Lisa Sterndale. You shot the chef, Renzo Locateli. And you shot the stockbroker, Graham Cleverley. - You're dead. - As your solicitor, I'd advise you to say nothing. - Who would have thought it? The little wimp. - Do you mean Harry Sterndale? - Who is he? - Come on, we know Harry Sterndale committed those murders. You help us, we'll help you. - You just told me you had TV pictures of me killing a visiting head of state. - Mr. Campbell-Stewart, please. - Even you can't help me, Richard. I'm going away for a long time. All right. I admit it. I killed those people. - Which people? - The ones who just spoke about. - You don't even remember their names. - I'm a professional hitman. I want seven to six other murders to be taken into account and I don't remember their names either. Would you remind me of them? And I'll make a public confession. You two will be heroes. - In a bizarre twist to the ongoing story about serial killer Jamie Campbell-Stewart. Who's also known as Roger Harold Brown The Dredge Colder. Mr. Stewart was today named a Duke... - [Reporter] Demonstrated a will to instruct to prison today The release of serial killer Jamie Campbell-Stewart. There are now 17 registered family lines for the man who captured the heart of Britain's young sect. - [Demonstrators] We love Jamie! We love Jamie! We love Jamie! (cheerful music) (door opens) (door bangs) - We owe it all to you. - It's not my usual service, but there you go. - She's expecting. - What? - We're naming him after you. - What if it's a girl? - We'll think of something similar. - Listen, I don't know what to say. - I don't know how to thank you. - If there's ever anything we can do. - There is. - What? - The name's on this. He's an absolute bastard. I wanted him dead for years. It's just that well, I never got around it.
