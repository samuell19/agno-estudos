See you tomorrow, huh? Grazie, grazie. That vincenzo, he comes in here every day. He never says a word. Just smiles and shakes his head like a puppy. He's happy, ma. Some people are just happy, you know? Guess so. - No. - What? What? Say it ain't true, lina. - Say it ain't true. - What's the matter? - Say you ain't closing. Closing forever. What are you talking about? Who told you that? Where'd you hear that? Everybody says so. First parducci's meat mart. Then catalano the grocer. Now you. You make the best bread. Nobody makes bread like poloni's. - Don't listen to nobody. We ain't closing. Get her some water. - You see, mama? I told you. Come and sit down. Don't worry, mrs. g. We're not going nowhere. Just rumors. Hi, marco. Hey, ang. You ladies want to try my petits fours? - Mm. - Fresh today. - Que bella. What are they? - little cakes. Try one. You'll feel better in no time. Well, maybe just one. Amazing. Would you get me a loaf of bread, please? Yeah. - You like it. That's good. There you go. He's quite the catch, that boy. He's so handsome. He's so talented. - That son of mine. I tell you. He should have so many girls, but his head is in the oven. What can I say? Thank you. Grazie. - Thank you. - Thank you. Come on, angelina. What's the matter? Why do you break her heart? - Who? - Angela. Who? Angela. I mean, you could take her out. Yeah, she's nice, but I got work to do, ma. Marco. Marco, you don't know how I worry at night. You don't know. I mean, I think a mother deserves to see her only son happy. A mother deserves a daughter-in-law. A mother deserves a grandchild. That is correct. You're in that kitchen day and night. Just like your father. You can't marry a bread mixer, and you can't have a baby with a cannoli. What is it with you? What is it with you? What is wrong with everybody here today? Okay. What's going on? This is a very bad day. I'm gonna sell the bakery. Sell? What are you talking sell? You can't sell. You know, when your father and I, we come to this country, we work and we work and we work, and what do I have? No family, no children, no wife and no money, and now I can't work. Just give me a chance. I'll turn it around, okay? - I met a man. He make a nice deal. Who? Doughnuts. America loves doughnuts. Walk into any crazy crunch shop, doughnut machine. 150 dozen an hour. Right before your eyes. Crazy crunch is unstoppable. We've mopped up the west coast. Now we're heading east. Here's what I can offer you. A place in the crazy crunch family, as the first crazy crunch franchise in the bronx with you, marco, as manager. Beautiful. Just beautiful. What's this? That's chef carpenter's olivier cake. A special, flourless chocolate cake. It's my personal favorite. Try this. Barozzi. - Almost. Something's missing. Look, mr. King, the polonis have been in our family for 50 years. We have our hearts in that place. You understand? We need more time. - I can give you a month. But only one. You are not the only bakery on arthur avenue, you know? Can you wrap this up for me to go, please? - Very good. - Thank you. â™ª Excuse me, I'm looking for grace carpenter, the pastry chef? I am not a machine, olivier. A birthday cake for 12 takes time. Well, lunch is in three hours. When were you planning on telling me? One more time, I'm gonna use the betty crocker mix. Okay, everybody, drop everything. We're gonna do a spice layer with a walnut meringue. Charlie, you do the batter. Anna, you start the icing. No. No questions, please. Just do it, okay? Oh, you're here. You're late. I've been waiting for you, and you're not a woman. I told the academy I'd take an intern if they sent a woman. - No, I'm not a woman, but... - Well, obviously not. - And what's your name? - Marco, but, uh... okay, marco, look, here. Do you temper chocolate? - Yeah, I know... - Good. Follow me. Linden, can I have my chocolate, please? Okay, now I'm gonna show you the way I like to do it, and that's the way you're gonna do it, okay? Because we don't have much time here. And that's what we have to do. Thank you very much, linden. Good job. All right, now do you understand what this is for? Yeah. Do you know why we temper chocolate? Yeah, I do, but, uh... - okay. Put this out here. And it's to get the correct sheen. Now, "s" shapes. All right? Now you. Thank you. Okay, someone's been paying attention in class. You got to groove with it. Groove with it? Excuse me. You know, sometimes I think the chocolate works me, you know? Grace carpenter. Yes? No, that's fine. Okay. That was my intern, and she is running late. So you would be? I've been trying to tell you. Name's marco. I'm a baker. I ate here last night, and tasted your olivier cake. And? It's your attempt at torta barozzi, right? You know about barozzi? Flourless chocolate cake. Made by only one bakery in italy. It's been a secret recipe for a century. Well, I hope you don't think you can come into my kitchen and get my recipe, because professional chefs do not share secrets. Well, that's a shame, 'cause where I come from, we do. - Oh, really? And where's that? The bronx. So I'll tell you my secret, anyway. It needs more sugar. A tablespoon, I'd say. That's your problem. No my problem is I have spent way too long talking to an obnoxious chef from the bronx when I have a cake to bake. Goodbye. No, you know, one more tablespoon of sugar would make it way too sweet. Well, don't worry. Anything you make will never be too sweet. Ciababy. Huh. Coming. Jim. Hey, grace. This is for you. - Oh, thank you. It's beautiful. Oh, it smells great in here. You been baking? Yes. This baker came by the restaurant today and told me that my olivier cake wasn't sweet enough. Oh. So I decided to do a little experimenting, you know? Try and prove him wrong. Who was he? Some guy from the bronx, if you can imagine. Anyway, it really bothered me. No, you know what? He really bothered me. He was so arrogant and cocky. And I just couldn't get it out of my head, so when I got home I made another cake, added a little more sugar, and I couldn't believe it. Two years I had been struggling with this recipe, and he just waltzes in and solves it? I mean, it makes me think maybe I'm not a good baker. Maybe I'm not a good pastry chef. Grace, you're getting yourself all upset about a spoonful of sugar. Well, it's important that I think that I'm good at what I do. Grace carpenter, you need a night off from desserts. Maybe you're right. It's just... he was so arrogant. All right, come on. I mean, he had these lips, like... telling me about my cake. He makes pizza. You should see the kitchen. Everything new. Assistants all over the place. And she runs it like some kind of dessert queen, you know? Maybe she got a job for you. I wouldn't work for her. She's a snob. She's all closed up. Like, uh, like dough that won't rise, you know? Bellabeauty. I can hear it in your voice. You're beginning to sound a lot like ma, you know that? You're watching the cooking channel. Tasty television 24 hours a day. - Hold on a second. I got to hear this. I'm your host, boz roswell, interviewing pastry chefs from across the country as they prepare to compete with the most ambitious, the most challenging dessert of them all, the showpiece. These showpieces are spectacular creations. Some as tall as five feet. They're made from spun sugar and chocolate, and every single bit of this arc de triomphe is edible. The chefs must also create a display of petits fours and a plated dessert. So you might think of this golden whisk competition as the olympics of desserts. It's a competition that stresses style and stamina. Here at the cooking channel, we asked top chef favorite jacques dujacques about his hopes for winning. Jacques, the grand prize is $1/4 million, the largest purse ever for a competition of this kind. Yes. What are your chances? Well, boz, we will win, of course, but it's not about the prize money. No, no, no. Shut up, you phony. It's about the love... - the love... - Love. ...of dessert. - Ugh. I'm gonna throw up. Well said, and good luck to you both. If you're a professional pastry chef, you can still participate; However, you will need a partner to team up with. And you'd better hurry, because the deadline for applications is just a week away. Hey. Remember me? Did you try it? Try what? More sugar in the barozzi. - Now why would I do that? Because you said to? No, because it's the right thing to do. What do you want? Food men always want something from me. - Not me. I got something for you. A business proposition. Thanks, but I'm happy where I am. Really? Are you really happy where you are? I think you should leave. Okay, look, I know you don't know me and I know you don't like me, and that's fine, because I don't like you either. Ugh. But I'm running out of time, and I think you might really want to hear what I have to say. You don't want to work here forever, do you? - Okay, barozzi boy. You got five minutes. I am very flattered that you ask, but I don't cook with just anyone. The best pastry chefs in the entire country enter the golden whisk. You need training and you need experience. - I have training. Culinary academy. - And? What restaurants? - None. I have this bakery. My parents run it. It's on arthur avenue in the bronx. Poloni brothers. You know it? Um, I don't get to the bronx much. You mean never. Okay, it's just... It's just not gonna work, and it's not a good time for me. I'm even thinking of quitting the business. - Get out of here. You're too good. I've just been cooking in somebody's restaurant since I was 22 years old, and I am burnt toast. Then open up your own place. Well, I was ready to do that three years ago, but nobody would finance me. Why? Because I'm a woman. So you just gave up? I'm sorry, but the answer is no. - Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. The prize money is 250,000 to split. That could kick-start your new place. - Oh, really? My place? Maybe it's to save your little bakery. A woman has never won the golden whisk. Imagine the publicity. For you. "Unknown bronx baker takes the dessert crown." You could be making a big mistake. You need this just as much as I do. Oh, really? And how do you know what I need? Excuse me. â™ª - Okay. Okay, okay. Back to work. Back to work. Bethany's had some beautiful mozzarella. I had to get some. Still warm. Excuse him. What's the matter? - You got a call. Some woman. Who? Never mind. Ma, who called? A grace carpenter. Who is she? I never heard of her. - She's a friend of mine. What'd she say? Where'd you meet this person? Ma, what did she say? She said to tell you... she'll do it with you. She'll do it? Yes. Yes. What kind of a girl leaves a message like that? Not a nice italian girl. I'll tell you that. Angela would never leave a message like that. - She said she'd do it. - Not with my son. Grace. I'll do it on one condition. That it's just desserts. Just desserts. Our personal lives are off limits. Whatever little drama you have going on at home, you keep it to yourself, and I'll do the same. Mm-hmm. So you're not gonna tell me that you grew up on park avenue, that your father teaches at columbia, your mother sells real estate, you're an only child, you love cats, you hate dogs, and you once had a meal that was so good of southern provence that it made you cry. You've done some research. I don't cook with just anyone. I'm serious. I have been burned too many times by too many chefs. I'm here to win, and that's it. Good. Now we have to name a captain. - Okay. I should be captain because it was my idea. But I have more professional experience. And you're famous, and I'm not. And I know several of the judges personally. And you're famous, and I'm not. And I convinced olivier to let us practice here in exchange for publicity, so I'm the captain. Problem with that? Aye aye, generalissimo. Architecture on the plate is over. What's hot now is several little tastes in different textures. I want to make a barozzi. Barozzi? But that's not... fancy? No. But if you've got the original recipe... well, no one has that. I do. My father brought it back from italy. Let me see. Not so fast. You got to promise me you won't show this to nobody. Cross my heart. - That's it? That's the secret? That's amazing. I never would have thought of that. That's why it's a secret. - Okay. We'll make a barozzi, but with a mocha glaze. Never. No, I tried it once. I watched these people eating it. They were fighting all night. The waiter said they were even talking divorce, so I sent out two plates. ...for five hours. Whatever. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Honey, I'm really, really sorry. By the time they had finished, it was like they had just fallen in love. Get out of here. Your dessert saved their marriage? True story. No. I won't make a barozzi with a glaze. No way. We'll save it for the final round, and we'll do it the traditional way. Okay, calm down. I know that you very much care about this. Tell me something do you really think that dessert can bring two people together? - I don't know. It never worked for me. Barozzi brought us together. Right. To cook. Yeah, that's what I meant. Well, we better start cooking. Yeah. Ugh, the air conditioning's out. No kidding. It's too hot to practice. We're a week and a half away. Every hour counts. I'm practicing. Polo. You want to win this? I want to win this. Yeah. â™ª - okay, I'm ready. Go ahead. Good. - What's going on? It's midnight. Two dozen loaves you were short yesterday. I almost lost the whole business from del monaco's. Tell him. Tell him. Listen, marco, maybe I should talk to the doughnut man. I'll get us some help. What are you talking about? Ma, do me a favor. Go upstairs and get some rest. I'll take care of this, okay? Come on. Come on. You gonna win? I got to win. Is it the money? It's not just about the money. Since school and whatever happened, I've been all here. I mean, now it's like I'm back in the game, you know? I'm working with one of the best chefs in new york, and she's incredible. Ah. True love has true flavor. What are you talking about? Me and grace? I never had true flavor. And now I'm too old. But you, it's not too late. Ugh, that base is beautiful. It's gonna be amazing. Yeah, but is it... is it new? Will they get it? - Oh, come on. It's gonna knock them out. I'm so excited. Oh. Hello. Hey. What are you doing here? I'm here to take you away from all this. Well, that's... that's great. I'll... i'll be right with you. Um, do you want to have a drink at the bar? Sure. Aren't you gonna introduce me to your friend? Um, jim, please meet my colleague, marco polo. Marco polo? Uh, I changed it from christopher columbus. Ah, funny. Oh, well, don't mind him. He inhales sugar all day. So I just flew in on my plane. So I thought of you. - That's so nice. I'd really like that. Um, can I have a minute? Sure. Sure. Okay. So grace told me about the contest. Sounds challenging. You make this? Uh, yeah. Ah, it's very impressive. - What is it? - Cake. Do you really have a plane? A couple. Yeah, one for business, one for pleasure. You like dessert, jim? Sure. Who doesn't? It's usually low fat for me, though. Got to watch the calories. So you're a dessert conservative? Well, I never really thought of it. As opposed to a dessert liberal. Someone who eats dessert after every meal. Well, I suppose. I never really thought of it like that. What are you guys talking about? Just desserts. Jim, nice to meet you. You too. Uh, why don't you all go on ahead and I'll clean up? - Really? - Yeah. Thank you. That's nice. Generalissimo. No, ma, they're too dry. I should just throw them away. She made them herself. Wow. You like to bake? Does she like to bake? She's in my kitchen all day and night. Mama, stop. She should have her own bakery. So this is it. This is the work area. And you got to meet my uncle. You know my uncle? I've only seen him a few times. Eh, he doesn't work... Hey, uncle fab, this is angela. She's gonna be helping us out for a while. Ah, angela. Hi, mr. Poloni. Call me fabrizio. Fabrizio. I like that. It sounds like music. We like to call him fab. - Hey. What's all this? - Hi, lina. - Hi. Angela's starting work for us today part-time. Yeah. All right, let's get her started. By the way, I can't practice on friday night. - Okay. What's his name? Just desserts. You're not the only one with a personal life. It'd take me all night to tell you mine. Oh, yes, I'm sure that you have a little black book that's filled with about 100 names of some bronx bombshells. What's your problem, huh? Every time somebody like you hears "the bronx," your nose scrapes the ceiling. You know who else comes from the bronx? Colin powell, calvin klein, Jennifer lopez. Yes, they're from the bronx. They're not still there. So why are you? You're good enough to cook anywhere. Why? 'Cause I'm trying to keep something from dying. Something worth saving. My neighborhood's losing families that have been around for generations. If they go, all the traditions they brought over from the old country are gone too. My father spent his life trying to preserve them. And now what do I do? Just walk away and forget about 'em? No. That's why I want to win this thing. I want my kids to taste what I've tasted. That's nice. Yeah? Let's practice. Yeah. Yeah. Angela, what are you doing? It's too fast. It's too much air. We're gonna have to throw it out. I'm sorry, marco. Uncle fab, can you please help out angela? I got to get out of here. No problem. You do it like this. Voila. Thank you. You make this? Uh, yeah. â™ª Mm. You really like them? You bake from your heart. Yeah, I do. I really wish you'd let me fly you there. We could take my pleasure plane. It's really very comfortable. Thank you, but marco and I have a few last-minute things to discuss on the flight, and... oh. Why do I think you're always running away from me? - Oh, I'm not, jim. It's just business. I mean, you know about business. Sure. But, uh, I don't really want to pressure you. It's just lately you seem, well, distracted. Well, I am distracted. I've got the competition, the restaurant, and then there's marco and there's you, and I'm starting to feel like some very thin icing being spread around here. I understand. Look, let me just get through this competition, and then we'll have some more time together. Promise. - Okay. Just remember, when those chefs start to make you crazy out there, you just give me a call. I'll be nice and normal. Okay, mr. Normal. Okay. Let's go. - I got it. - Oh, thank you. Sure. Who am I kidding? We don't got a prayer winning this thing. We're not ready. Showpiece is a mess, and grace, she's, uh... she's making me crazy. When we're working together, it's like we've got this secret language between us or something, you know? I've never felt that before with nobody. She can feel it too. I know it. - This is for you. For good luck. What is it? If you get stuck, you use it. But not too much. It's very strong. - It doesn't have a smell. What is it? It's a special flavor from my grandfather. Fab, what's it for? Hey, if you get stuck, you use it. Maybe it works, maybe not. I need all the help I can get. You're okay. You're good. Just watch your head, huh? Mwah. Okay, the cocktail party begins at 7:00. From 9:00 to 11:00 we prep the kitchen, and we got to check out the pastillage in case it was bumped around on the flight. Will you relax? - What do you mean? I am relaxed. Yeah, like a volcano. Okay, so I'm nervous. I mean, this is like being in the world series when all you've ever done is play stickball on the block, you know? - Don't worry. You're ready. You think? Okay. Everyone is here. Absolutely everyone. It's fabulous. Oh, there's roland and francois. They won last year. Aren't they cute? That is barry felt. He's the executive director. Barry, grace carpenter. Grace. So glad you could join us this year. - Oh, thank you. This is my partner, marco polo. Very nice to meet you. How are you? This is a team to watch. Everyone's been talking about their entry submission, especially the torta barozzi. Everyone's been buzzing about it. Word has it they're using an original recipe. Is it true? Oh, now, barry, you know baker's secrets. - Fair enough. I wish you both good luck. - Thank you. Thank you. Nice to meet you. It's very cool. Hi. Isn't it? I wonder if the head judge is here yet. What are you talking about? You know the head judge too? - Know him? He was my mentor. One of the few men in this business with a heart. - Great. What's his name? Emile fragonard. Oh, there he is. Emile. Come on. I'll introduce you. That's all right. Hello. - Cheri. My manhattan sunshine. But how are you? Too many years go by. Yes, yes. Emile fragonard, I'd like to introduce my team partner, marco polo. Hey, emile. Emile? What...? What happened? Does he know you? Uh-huh. He taught me at the academy. - Oh. Did he fail you? - Well, not quite. He, uh... - it's jacques! There he is! Oh, jacques dujacques. - Ah, hello. Hello, how are you? Barry! Ah! Hello, monsieur! Oh, my gosh. That's his girlfriend. Or... should I say watchdog? You think ice is cold? Oof. Thank you so much. Ah, I must say hello. Grace, how are you? Nice to see you again, jacques. You remember my colleague, candice fallon? - Of course. - Hello. And, marco, how are you? Doing good, jack. Oh, no, no, it's jacques now. I apologize, jack. Did you know he changed his name from jack jackson to jacques dujacques? Very clever. I mean, jacques is a real chef's name after all, right? What are you doing? As I said, I'm doing good, and I'm working hard. Well, good. Working hard to destroy you. You... - oh, marco, come. The past is the past, huh? Let's be friends. What? I'll take it neat. Uh, nice to see you both again. Nice to see you. What are you doing? First emile, then jacques? I don't want to talk about it. Do you want a partner for this contest? Then you're talking about it. Now. Okay. Spill everything. I met jack... jacques... at my first day at the culinary academy. He didn't have pastry in his blood, not like me, but he was there to learn, so I showed him everything I knew. We started making waves, we won prizes, we... everybody was talking about us. We were the dynamic duo of desserts. We began to make plans. We had this great idea that we would open up this string of pastry shops, go national, you know? But then one day I found out that he signed a deal, a big deal, without me. And when I confronted him, he said, "we never decided anything definite." I'm sorry. But welcome to the world. - Yeah. But there's more. When I get angry, I do stupid things. Today, class, we are going to study special recipes for springtime. And, actually, that will be a great opportunity... you. I'm gonna murder you. Come on, you punk. You bum! So you got kicked out? Emile told the whole pastry world that I was a psycho with a sifter. Nobody would hire me. I went back to the bronx. Never trust a food man. Now I'm starting to think that I should include you in that. Why didn't you tell me all of this? Grace, grace, you know what? Look, I'm sorry, okay? But when I saw him, it all came back. But I'm hoping that you'll understand, 'cause I'm the best pastry chef you've ever met, and together we're gonna win this thing. Okay. Grace, surprise. Ji... what are you doing here? I came to watch you win. I can't believe it. Marco. Hello again. Shall we? Yeah. So I decided I couldn't miss this, knowing how much it means to you. That's just wonderful. I... I hope you don't get bored, though, considering how busy I'm gonna be. - Don't worry about me. I'm here to support you. And, look, I got the zinfandel suite - right next door to yours. - Oh. It only took an enormous bribe to the desk clerk. Oh, that's great. I just hope you don't mind... can I go to bed right away? I'm just wiped out. You do that. Listen, if you need anything, you just give me a call. I am your sous chef for the weekend. I'll see you in the morning. - Good night. - Night. Buon giorno. Angelina. Hi, fab. Wow, don't you look handsome today. Grazie. And your hair is bella. Thank you. That's okay. He's coming on now. What are you doing? Fabrizio. Who? Who? Who? Marco. Fabrizio, how could you forget? Hurry up. Get over here. Turn on the tv. Sit down. Pay attention. Hurry up. Good morning, and welcome to the cooking channel's exclusive live coverage of the golden whisk competition here at the rolling hills inn in beautiful napa valley, californ-i-a. I am your humble host, boz roswell. And, folks, this place is simmering with excitement. Behind me, you can see the competition area, where our eight teams are readying themselves for the elimination round. Okay. First, our judges will inspect each and every kitchen for any violations of the rules. How was that? Is that right? Yeah, good to see you. Guten morgen. Inspection. Ha. What's that? Rule seven. Pre-molded chocolate is verboten. Deduct ten points. Those aren't ours. They were in your refrigerator. Did you put these in there? No, did you? Of course not. Our refrigerator was tampered with. Yeah. I insist I speak with barry. Barry! These were put in overnight. Impossible. This area was secure. Well, if we were gonna cheat, do you think we'd leave 'em somewhere you'd find 'em? Well, I'm sorry, but I can't do for you what I can't do for everyone else. I leave it to the chief judge, monsieur fragonard. Emile. May I have a word with you? Millie, you know that... that I'm not the cheating type. Do you remember that caramelized banana tart with the macadamia nuts that I made you for your birthday? Oh, yes. You said it was impeccable. That's me. Yes. That's you, my darling. But not him. A good pastry chef not only maintains order, he reveres it. Ten point deduction. A minor setback. I'm sure you'll both compete beautifully today. Good luck. Well, I'm glad to see that your past won't interfere. He did this. Who? Jacques! - Marco. Mon cheri, cheri? You really thought you could do it, huh? You really thought you could get us kicked out? Well, I want everybody to hear. This means war! Excuse me? And when I strike, you'll know it. Oh, what is the matter with him, huh? He must be crazy. And we're back. Come on. Their inspections now complete, the judges return to the tasting area, as our eight teams ready themselves to begin this arduous competition. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I'm barry felt, executive director of the golden whisk competition. And I can't think of any place I'd rather be... it's okay. Than right here, right now. Yes. We start this morning with our elimination round. Each of our eight teams will make a display consisting of bonbon and petit four. After our distinguished international panel of judges tastes them, we will be left with just four teams. Is everyone ready? Okay, here we go.

You were great. You were incredible. No, you were. It's like you knew what I needed right when I needed it. Maybe we do make a good team after all, huh? Wolfgang, this is the team I was telling you about. I'd like you to meet grace carpenter. Oh, yes, grace carpenter of restaurant olivier, - if I remember correctly. - Yes, yes. Wolfgang puck, the man that has more restaurants than the yankees have pennants. Marco polo. Shortened from poloni. As in the famous poloni bakery? Well, good luck to you both, and nice to meet you. Yeah. - Nice to meet you too. - You too. This way. You look starstruck. No, I don't. We are about to announce the two finalist teams, and here to present it is a culinary master who needs no introduction. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you my close, personal friend, wolfgang puck. And now, wolfgang will announce the four chefs who have climbed the everest of our profession. Our finalists are team dujacques... And team carpenter. Grace carpenter, marco polo, jacques dujacques and candice fallon. The final battle will be held tomorrow at 11:00 a.m. we'll see you all back here then. Congratulations, all. Congratulations. And thank you, wolfgang. Hey, you two were terrific. Makes what I do seem so dull. - Thank you. It's just desserts. Oh, yeah, but it's physical. It makes me want to get my hands right in the dough. I thought you already had your hands in a lot of dough. - Ah, that's good. Very good. Well, I know marco does not want to speak with me, but I must say, grace, I thought your work was... Thank you. Grace, jacques, gourmetmagazine wants to interview you, our captains. Would you come with me? I'll catch up with you guys. - Hey, ma. - Marco. Hey, did you watch? - Yeah, I saw. Now come home. Ma, we're in the final round. They're disgusting. - Who? - The two of them. Listen. You have to listen. Oh, it's terrible. - Fab, stop. - Bella. Can you hear? In the flour room, they are. The two of them. Your uncle ought to be ashamed of himself and that woman. Ooh, I should have known better. Ha. I don't even know how I'm gonna look her mother in the eye again. You mean uncle fab and angela? You better come home, because I'm telling you, I don't know what I'm gonna do. I don't know what I'm gonna do. Ma, I can't come home. Marco, could I talk to you in private? - Yeah, yeah. Sure. So does grace ever mention me? - No. - Oh. That's 'cause we don't talk about our personal lives. It interferes with the work. So here's how it is. Um, I've been chasing grace a while now, and she's been, well, reluctant. How long? Three years, off and on. But lately I'm been getting some very positive signals, and so... tonight's the night. Wow. Maybe tonight's not the right night, jim. Because, uh, she's gonna be wiped out, you know? Well, I know, but, uh, well, I'm off to russia on business, and I don't want to lose my momentum. So I have a favor to ask. I want to make this really special, so I thought, "put the ring in a chocolate." A hollow chocolate. So she goes to take a bite, and... is that possible? Yeah, anything's possible with chocolate, jim. Now I know this isn't the right time for you, but, uh, could you help me? Yeah. Yeah, sure. I'd do anything for grace. You know that. - Well, great. Uh, not a word to grace, now. Absolutely not. And try not to mix it up with the almonds, huh? I spent 25,000. 25. Don't you worry. I'll bring it to you when it's ready. You're the best. Grace is gonna love this. I know she will. Hi. Would you like to take a walk with me? You know, I watched you working today, and I said to myself, "there is a real dessert man." - Well, I watched you too. Doing all the work. Is that how it is? Well, you know, he's on tv. He's got a cookbook. The white house called last week. Jacques is a meteor. Is that what you want? Well, I did, but now I see how he treats people. He squeezes them dry like juice from an orange. And I'm about to get squeezed. I thought you were his watchdog. Oh, I helped create the monster. And now I don't know how to stop it. Did he plant the chocolates in our refrigerator? Ah, he wants to see you down too. - I knew it. I knew it. I, uh, I think it's best if we go back in separately. Okay. Dark chocolate. And hazelnuts. Her favorite, she said. What else? Ah. True love has true flavor. â™ª Now we'll see who she really loves. Hi. Hi. Where you off to? Uh, just taking a walk. I was gonna go for a walk myself. Maybe we can, uh... oh, well, um... if you must know, I'm meeting somebody for a drink. Oh, jim. - Uh, no. Jim has some business to do. I, um... okay, you're gonna find out anyway. I'm meeting jacques. What? Why? It's a professional meeting. He liked what I had to say about flavors, and he wants to talk some more. And you're gonna get up close and personal with the guy that wrecked my life? Look, maybe I just want to have a meeting with him to hear his side of the story. You two have to settle this. You're like two little boys in a sandbox. I'll take care of it myself, all right? Oh, you've done a great job so far. Grace, stay away from him. He's gonna charm you, he's gonna snake you. Just like he did me, just like he did candy. What did he do to candy? - Nothing. It's just what he's gonna do. Have you been talking to candy? You stay away from her, polo. Grace, I just don't want anything to happen to you, all right? I'll be fine. I'm gonna say one thing and no more. The girl's too young for you. Maybe she's too young for you, but not for me. All my life I been looking for a girl like that, and then I give up. I think maybe I get too old. Then boom. Like a sack of flour. She makes me want to start all over again, huh? I'm a happy man. Oh, good for you. What about me, huh? My husband's dead, my son's going off to california with some woman. You want to sell this business, and now this. Do me one big favor, okay? Don't you talk about happy to me, okay? You know, in all the years I've known you, I've never seen you look like this. Now I suppose I have to find somebody new for marco. Talent. Talent excites me. Anyone can learn technique. Technique is easy, but true talent is rare, and you, grace, have true talent. Thank you. But I must say, I think you're limiting yourself, no? How do you mean? Someone like you should be creating her own world, not spitting out desserts at the restaurant of another. Oh, I've tried, but new york is tough, and even tougher if you're a woman. You know I was thinking about quitting? Mm. But this contest brought me back. Being around everybody. I feel more energized than I have in a long time. Yes, well, voila. This make me so happy, because now is the time. Something entirely new. A national chain of dessert shops, under my name, but each location run by a top chef making only the best desserts, and I want you to be the first. Well, I'm very flattered. What about candy? Candy has taught me so much, but she is bored, huh? She's slipping. This competition will be our last together. What can you do? You move on. So what do you say? - Well, uh, it's true. It's what I always wanted. I, um, I just have to ask one question. Is this the same thing that you and marco thought of in school, to open this chain together? - Yes, yes. Poor marco. Such a shame what has happened to him. Sometimes I think he also burned his... huh? Some of us are winners. Some of us are losers. Marco... is a loser. It's tempting, jacques. Very tempting. But I'm afraid you underestimate me. How? Marco polo is the hardest working, most genuine man that I have ever met, and despite everything that you have stolen from him, he is 5,000 times the chef that you will ever be. So if I were you, I'd start saying your prayers, because tomorrow we are gonna whip you so bad that there will be nothing left except a lot of steam coming out of your lying mouth. Bye. Ooh. You save your prayers for your souffles. So I saw jacques. Yeah? He said you were a loser, so I threw my wine at him. You defended me? Mm-hmm. Does that mean...? Oh, no. No food men. I promised myself. Food men always let me down. I'm different. Yes. You are different. Well, that was, uh... oh, don't say it. Don't say it. That was sweet. Yes, it was. I haven't had a kiss like that since... jim. Oh, no. What are we gonna do about jim? Listen to me. What you want is the heat of the oven, the smell of melted chocolate. You want that feel of the warm dough in your hands. You're a food girl, and you better face it. It's a food man for you or nobody. Grace. Hi. Jim. Hello. Marco. - How are you? - Hi. So what's cookin'? We're just talking. - Just desserts. Always desserts. You two never stop, do you? I should leave you two love birds alone. And, uh, remember what my uncle used to say. What does that mean? True love has true flavor. Ciao. Marco. I'll see you in the morning. Okay. May I join you? How do you feel? Um, I'm... a bit overwhelmed. Well, it's a big day. You know, I was thinking I probably shouldn't have come here. To the contest, I mean. Maybe it's a little too much for you. Oh, uh, no. I'm glad you came. You're always so calm and considerate. Do I calm you? - Yes. Yes, you do. I think. No, I'm just starting to think that I don't even know how to be with a man like you. Am I that difficult? No, that's it. With somebody who's gonna treat you well? Yes, but I'm just... I'm starting to think that I'm not happy unless I'm miserable. Does that make any sense to you? Well, I have something for you. Go ahead. Now you're being difficult. - Yeah. Here. Chocolate? Take a bite. â™ª Mm. This is unbelievable. Where did you get it? Well, I have a friend in the business. I asked him for his best. No, I mean the chocolate. It's exquisite. It's breathtaking. Marco made it. Marco made this? Grace, will you marry me? - Oh. Oh, I'm starting to feel... lightheaded. Almost... almost dizzy. So now she's probably gonna marry him. Mr. excitement. Oh, what a shame. Yeah. You know what else she said? She said she's never met anyone who cooks like me. That's what she said. Well, you know a lot about desserts. More than jacques. You got that right. I taught him everything he knows. I gave him all my secrets. What kind of secrets? Family secrets. Ingredients. Secret ingredients. I heard that the torta barozzi has a secret ingredient. That's right. But I can't tell you that. Oh, no, of course not. I, uh, I understand completely. To secrets. To secrets. Oh. You feeling better? Yes. Yes, um... I'm fine now. Can I get you anything? Water? Oh, jim. It was such a sweet proposal. Would you like to wear it? Oh, the way I'm feeling, I might lose it in the cake batter tomorrow. Okay. I'll check in on you a little later, okay? Oh. Ooh. Oh, oh. Are you okay? - Hey, I'm great. I'm great. How are you? I'm fine. Hey, remember when we were talking about the barozzi earlier? Mm. Well, I heard that the secret ingredient is no big deal, that it doesn't even make a difference. What are you talking about? Of course it makes a difference. Well, I heard that it's just all made up. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. - Oh, yeah? You want to see it? Oh, no. - Mm-hmm. Come on. - No, i... - come on. - No, i... - come on. It doesn't make a difference? What do they know? Let me show you something. Here it is. The secret recipe. Wow. But you can't tell nobody about that. Especially jacques. It is a secret, after all. I would never tell him. He's hurt you enough already. You know, you're really nice to me. Really nice to me. I'm gonna lay down for a while. Hi, it's me. Yeah, he gave it up easy. Okay, get a pen and write this down. What? What? Candy? Just a minute. Just a minute. I'm coming. Candy? Grace. What was she doing here? - Who? - Candy. I just saw her leaving. Look, I had a couple of drinks. I had a lot of drinks. She walked me up here, and I... we were just talking. What'd she get from you? She didn't get nothing from me. Well, let me think. Wait a minute. Let me think. I... I... oh, no. I showed her the recipe for barozzi. But she wouldn't... she wouldn't, huh? Oh, gosh. Grace, no. Jacques was right. You are a loser. Because you didn't realize what you've already won. When I tasted the chocolate that the ring was in... it did something to me, and I knew... I knew we were supposed to be together. But I was wrong. - Please don't go. Grace. Grace, please don't... Grace. Grace, come on, open up. Grace. Grace. Look, I'm... i'm sorry. I let it all go too far. I love you. And I don't care about nothing else. We can quit the competition. I mean it. Grace. But I don't care what happens today. I know if I've lost you, I've lost everything. I know I've lost everything if I've lost you. Come on, grace. You all right? Yeah. I, um, I've spent the last hour putting on my uniform, taking it off. Should I stay? Should I go? And I really want to explain. You have two planes. One for business, one for pleasure. And I finally realized that I really want both in one guy at the same time... Business and pleasure. And the only guy I know who's like that is a chef, and he's inside waiting for me right now. I'm sorry, jim. It's okay. It's kind of hard to compete with a guy who makes his own chocolate. What was in that stuff, anyway? I wish I knew. Well, is it okay if I stay for the final round? You better. Come on, grace. Hey, jacques, I got something I want to say to you. I still don't know why you did what you did to me, and I'm done trying to figure it out. All I know is, you got to live with it every day, but I don't. I'm moving on. Candy, I suggest you do the same. You came. Only to cook. Okay. What was that about? I wished them luck. Where's jim? He's in the audience. But he's gonna fly away after this is all over. You okay? Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, chefs and judges. We're ready to begin. Competitors, you have two hours to prepare one perfect dessert. Is everybody ready? Yes! Let's say it all together. On your mark, get set... Go! The cooking channel has obtained copies of the ingredient requests submitted by each team, and as impossible as it may seem, both teams appear to be creating exactly the same dessert. Sources close to the competition tell us it is a torta barozzi, an italian flourless chocolate cake, deemed the holy grail by dessert chefs. Let's watch. Can we make something else? It's too late. Well, what do we do now? We make the best barozzi we can. â™ª Okay, confess. What did you put in the chocolate on the ring? Nothing special. Dark chocolate, hazelnuts. Come on, marco. I am an authority on chocolate, and I've never tasted anything like that before. Tell me what it was. Well, uncle fab gave me this. I don't know what's in it. Doesn't have an odor. I know. I don't know what it is. Well, whatever it is, it certainly worked for me. So far, these four masters of the mixer seem evenly matched. But wait a moment. There seems to be something unusual happening over at team carpenter. Let's take a look. Team carpenter appears to be adding some sort of flavoring to the batter. Hey, what's he putting in there? - Don't worry. He knows what he do. What do you mean? This is quite unexpected. - Oh, look. It's perfect. 30 minutes. 30 minutes. We've got to make it different. It's got to be different. Make the glaze. The glaze? You said no glaze. You said it's not traditional. It's not barozzi. It'll be our barozzi. â™ª Are you sure about this? No. You? No. Then let's do it. Time is up. Your desserts must now be complete. In front of me, you can see the judges performing the crucial, difficult task of choosing between these two brilliant presentations. Ladies and gentlemen, the moment of truth has arrived. Judges, when I call your country, will you please raise your scorecards. Your votes first please for team dujacques. France. 9.9. Britain. 9.9. Germany. 9.9. Japan. 9.8. The votes please from the united states of america. The usa. 9.9. Thank you very much indeed. And now, judges, your votes please for team carpenter. France. 9.8. This puts team dujacques in the lead. Britain. 9.9. Germany. 9.9. Japan. 9.9. Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a tie. Everything depends on the final vote. The united states of america. 10.0! - What? What? That's crazy? The winner of this year's golden whisk competition 15 minutes. You leave a barozzi in the oven for 15 minutes. Not 16 minutes. You're a phony. You're not a chef. And you're not french. Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. - Terribly sorry. That was my fault. - No, it was... mine. Entirely. Hey, you were terrific up there. - Oh. Thank you. - I'm jim. - Candice. Hey, are you headed home? I have a plane. I could give you a lift. One for business, one for pleasure. Yeah. Ma, where is everything? Well, we're renovating. Are you gonna stand there, or are you gonna help us? You must be grace. It's nice to meet you. Hi. I saw you on tv. About that phone call, I already forgave you, so don't worry. I'm gonna make you a cup of coffee. Yeah, I guess so. You know what? The truth is, we, uh, couldn't have done it without you. Yes, what was the flavor in those drops? - Water? - Water? It had to be more than that. True love... has true flavor. â™ª â™ª
