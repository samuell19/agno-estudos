Now let me show you where tonight's magic is gonna happen. It's a little area of the set I like to call the "Love Nest." Ah, yes. This is to my liking. Designed by clinically insane Swedish architects to encourage optimal lovemaking. Slipper satin couch which comfortably seats up to four participants. ♪ Snuggle ♪ A well-stoked fire, the lights of which will illuminate the sweat upon our writhing bodies. ♪ Oh, sweaty, sweaty me ♪ A carcass of a dead animal, as a sober reminder of the fact we're still alive. ♪ Hell yeah ♪ Let's take it somewhere a touch more private, if you don't mind. Ah, the boudoir. I love art, especially the naked stuff. It makes me think of... sex. I did that one myself at age nine. It still turns me on. I hope you'll feel comfortable here. Nothing's off limits in the Love Nest. Except that room. That's the man cave. That's for me and the boys to bro out. It's got a mini-fridge and a kick-ass poster of a Lamborghini. It's really cool. But like I said, off limits! We'll be keeping track of how many babies are conceived tonight on our board. We need your help to meet our goal of 75,000 new babies by the end of the show, or Christmas will be ruined. Our operators are standing by to take your calls. Tell them about your lovemaking experiences or just ask them for tips. If you want to have a guaranteed baby, tell the guy you're on the pill. I'm glad to hear you just made love. You did it! Congratulations! Yes! Meanwhile, all night, our special guests will be bringing down the house with performances guaranteed to get you in the mood. Oh, you're a polygamist? Oh... We can count on you for three? Ha ha! We've got three! And now, to kick things off, a lovely song from a happy couple... legendary duo Misty & Blair. Thank you, Michael. You know, Misty and I are so happy to be here to celebrate love and to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary. How do we do it?

Hey! Stop it! You started out so sweet, and now you're downright perverse. Excuse me? I beg to differ. No, we were perverse from the very beginning. Yeah, that "red or blue" thing was actually a debate about the color of our privates by the end of the night. And the "little fight before going out for a bite," that was about whether to buy a bigger butt plug. And I still think we need it. Oh, you would just love that, wouldn't you? - All right, get out of here! - My asshole is lonely. Now let's check in with our board. You're having trouble conceiving? Oh, I see. You're having trouble conceiving the premise of this telethon. I hope you're having a sexy time snuggled up with your special someone. Go ahead, give them a little kiss right now. I'll wait. That's nice. Now what you want to do is take your fingers and just put... What is that sound? It couldn't be. Bolton. Kenny G. Surprised to see me? Not as surprised as I am to see you still haven't cut your hair. And I, in turn, am surprised that you have. For in our locks lies the strength of Samson. You were once a brave warrior in the tribe of Long Locksmen, which is a thing! That was a long time ago. I have forsaken that life. I'm a Short-hair now. You and so many others. Meat Loaf. Billy Ray Cyrus. All four dudes in Metallica. Yanni hanging on by a fucking thread! I'm doing a toot for each one of the dudes. Yeah, I got that. You betrayed your true nature, and for that, I shall destroy you. Fine. Let's do this. Whoa! Chill! I meant with music, man. What is with you and the guns? What gun? I'm sorry. Can we stop? You just killed a cat. I don't think so. No, you threw your gun, then we heard a bang, - and then a cat screamed. - No, you're mistaken. I can see cat blood all over the wall! That was there before. The wall covered in cat blood was there before? Can I help you with something, Kenny? Prepare yourself for the Duel of Kings. May all mortals rejoice as we regale them with the music of the gods. Not bad for a horn man. Well, isn't that funny? What started as a duel ended in a chill jam sesh. They always do. I'll take my leave of you. But remember always the word of the Locksmen Prophecy: "Only in your darkest hour shall your locks spring forth." Cool. Well, see you later, Kenny. Okay! Assholes. If you're looking for the perfect gift for your true love, look no further than Custom Chocolatiers. I paid a visit to their workshop in Solvang for a sneak-peek. Custom Chocolatiers is a special place. People like things personalized, tailored to their own specific tastes. We can do that. We do do that. Why don't you tell me a little bit about your girlfriend, and I'll use that information to design the perfect assortment? Well, let's see. She's a bold woman. She's very strong, very passionate. She's refined. She sort of enjoys the finer things in life. Oh. But she's not afraid to have a little fun. She's worldly. Worldly? Does your lady like nougat? Hmm. I'm not sure. All right. We've got these candies. You've seen these before. You can inscribe whatever you want. We custom-make these. "Hey, sweetie, I love your style," "Ooh, mama, you're really turning me on over here," "Yo, hit me up online, I'll shoot you an email sometime, honey." Every example I've given is too big to fit on a little candy like this, so maybe just use what we have already. I think sometimes she puts on a tough exterior, but I know that inside she's got a soft center. - Does she like toffee? - I don't think so. She's sweet, but she's kind of got a dark sense of humor, dry. You've got to give me something to work with. I'm looking at my kit. I've got walnut, coconut cream. I've got some cherry cordials. Well, she's very cordial. You know, why don't we do this? Let's just do 12 plains. Oh, okay. When you present this to her, there's different ways you can do it. Okay? You could do sort of 1920s, like, sort of little boy, like... You know, just make it seem bigger than you. Here you go. You could a tough-guy version. Eat that! There's chocolate in there! There's also magic, which is, like... It's floating like this, and in CGI, you can just take... this can all come out. First, get this as a still, and then it floats. So, you're just kind of, like, "Hey, sweetie. Happy Valentine's Day." - Okay. - Another service we have here is, if you got a box of chocolates from someplace else and it's all jumbled up, you don't know what's inside, we have an ultrasound machine. So, bring it in, and I will be able to identify it for you. And this one is... plain. All right, that's everything. I'd like to offer you a complimentary chocolate water. - Oh. - And we're all set here. So, that is 12 plains. - Oh, it's all melted. - Oh. Many people don't realize that this customization makes it a lot harder on the manufacturer. So, even though it's Custom Chocolatiers, we strongly suggest that you choose one of our standard options. It makes it much better for the both of us. And that's the story of Custom Chocolatiers. Why did I go all the way to Solvang? They didn't even cut to me once during the entire video. Isn't tonight fantastic? Looks like a lot of you are making babies out there, which is great. But don't stop now. - You know, I was just thinking how... - Hey, Bolton! This show fucking blows, man! Hmm. It seems as though a group of punks have infiltrated our studio. - So, you don't like my show, huh? - Yeah. It sucks ass! - I guess you think it's kind of hokey. - No duh! - Perhaps even a little uncool? - Shit yeah! Well, I think I have something a bit more up your alley. Hit it! ♪ Just take those old records Off the shelf ♪ ♪ I'll sit and listen to them By myself ♪ ♪ Today's music ain't got The same soul ♪ ♪ I like that old time rock and roll ♪ ♪ Don't try and take me to a disco ♪ ♪ You'll never even get me out On the floor ♪ ♪ In ten minutes I'll be late for the door ♪ ♪ I like that old time rock and roll ♪ ♪ Still like that old time Rock and roll ♪ ♪ That kind of music Just soothes the soul ♪ He's not even gonna drink it! ♪ I reminisce about the days of old ♪ ♪ With that old time rock and roll ♪ - No, you've got to hit that spin, Michael. - I'm trying. You're not trying hard enough. Do it again from the top. Five, six, seven, eight... You've got to hit that! Don't fucking mess with me! You get this spin like your life depends on it! Five, six, seven, eight... No. You lean in, then you point. - Point, then lean in? - No! Lean, then point. Think of those fucking punks out there and make them scared of real rock and roll! Don't touch the piano! What are you, fucking crazy?! You tease it. You tease it. You don't press the keys. Make those punks fear you! Give it to me! Give it to me! And when they come for you... and believe me, they will come for you... this performance will be the only thing to prove that Michael Bolton is cool! How do you actually know the punks will show up? Oh, they'll show up. They always show up. Pick up the milkshake, take two steps, put down the milkshake. Do not drink it. Stop! You've only got four weeks, people! And then we step across and we see there's a second guitar photo. - Why? - To fuck with their heads. After much consideration, I have decided that the dancing musical note will be played by... Alan. Oh! It just seems like there's such a small chance of punks barging in. There's still a chance! You have one more time, one more go at this. Five, six, seven, eight... ♪ Still like that old time Rock and roll ♪ ♪ That kind of music Just soothes my soul ♪ ♪ I reminisce about the days of old ♪ ♪ With that old time rock and roll ♪ So, what do you punks have to say now? That... was... badass! That's what I thought. Oh, Romeo, my man, I like your style. And now, here to tell us about the future of romance, virtual reality expert Dr. Vince Harbert. Thank you, Michael. Yes, my team and I design virtual erotic simulations, and I brought one for you to try right now. - Jack me in, Doc. - All right. Let's get this on you. All right. Wow. This is incredible. And it only gets better. Watch. Oh, mama. What have we here? - Hello. - I've been waiting for you. ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ - Wait, what? - Don't forget your pill. - My pill? - She means your Cialis. I have to take Cialis in virtual reality? Yes. We found it was beneficial to add some real-world obstacles into the VR. It makes the simulation more immersive and, well, sexy. Okay. Hmm. Where are they? Maybe I'll try these drawers. Let's find those pills. Hurry, baby. I want you so badly. I am hurrying. Come on. Oh, got 'em. All right, there they are. - What? Empty? - You need to get a refill at the pharmacy. - I have to refill the prescription? - Yep. And... - Here we are. - Okay, it looks pretty normal. Oh, wow. Why, hello, Mr. Bolton. - Well, this is an interesting turn. - It certainly is. I'll get your prescription. Okay. Thank you very much. - What? - $22.50. All right, now you have to pay. Get out your wallet and swipe your debit card. Are you kidding me? Declined? Give me a break. - Well, maybe try a different card. - I only have the one. Okay, why don't you just pay cash? Great! You've got your Cialis. Let's head out into the parking lot. Get in your car. Start the engine. Back out slowly. - Oops! You spilled coffee on you! - Oh, God! Pull out of the parking lot, and we're gonna get on the expressway. And now you're home. Finally. Let's get this party started. I missed you. Come here and give it to me, big boy. Your wish is my command. Hey! Hands off my wife, you son of a bitch! What the... ow! Ow! What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, Michael, but that's my wife that I put into the simulation, and I'm not just gonna sit here and let myself get cucked by the likes of you! Get him! Ow! Oh! Yes! Ow! Oh, baby, it is so hot watching you beat up Michael Bolton. All right. Yeah. I'm just gonna leave you to it. Yeah, baby. Yeah, baby! Have you tried saying things to each other that are not trite and mundane? You know, perhaps thinking outside the bun. No, I made that payment last week. No, I gave... how'd you find me?

I have a brand-new line of Chef Roy's Bakery Delights available at your local grocer, including this limited-edition Valentine's Day pink champagne cake. Well, we've got a few lucky volunteers to help us give this thing a taste. Come on out, guys. Dianne, Ben, Susan, Darryl. Let's dig in, gang. - Get in there. - All right.

Uh, yeah, I don't mind if I do." I've been nailed. Oh! Look at Dianne. She's all, like, "I guess today's my cheat day." Good one. Oh, look at Darryl. He's going, "Cake?

She's going, "Well, I guess I'm off my diet today." I guess so. Look at Darryl. He's going, "And I pretty much just shot in my pants. Not joking." No, I'm not like that. Ben! Ben's all, "Me Tarzan. You cake." Look at Darryl. He's going, "Cake's good and all, but I'd rather be jacking it!" Darryl, please, that's not appropriate. - I didn't say that. - You were thinking it. Susan's going, "Okay, that just got weird!" Michael's going, "Hey, I didn't sign on for this!" I really didn't. And look at Darryl. He's going, "Cake's good and all, but I'd rather eat Dianne's butt!" - Darryl! - What the hell, man? Everybody, please, please. I'm sorry we only have cake, Darryl, and you can't just eat my butt. Darryl, what do you have to say for yourself? I'll tell you what I have to say... It's all true, okay? Yeah, I thought it all!

"Nessun dorma," Puccini's most powerful, beautiful aria about love. But it's too dangerous. Every time someone performs it on TV or in the movies, someone's assassinated. You know, - Impossible, Rogue Nation, - The Sum of all Fears. - Those are just movies! This is real life. So, do it!

I'm your son?! What the fuck is going on?! Michael, we have to do something! We're flatlining! Oh, Michael, we lost one. Only in your darkest hour shall your locks spring forth.

But what are you doing here? I thought you'd left me. No! Why would I leave the father of our new baby boy? That's what your text meant? There's a new man in your life and he's inside you? Yes!

And, Michael, you've done it. You've saved Christmas. I'm so happy this happened. Rock on, Bolton. All hail Lord Boltron, the king of Valentine's Day. You're free to go. Oh, hello.
