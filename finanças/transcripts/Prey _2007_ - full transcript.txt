That’s why I’m here, brother. You’re going to put me out of a job, you know that? We’ll see. I'd like to welcome all of the new guests to our prison. This is your family now. I'd like to ask the old members Move. Here we have rules and regulations to follow. I hope our new members will obey them. Move! If these members are not comfortable in their new home, and cannot cooperate, we regret to inform you that you shall be reformed and re-educated in accordance with our rules. Please remember: Your happiness is our highest priority. There. Change your clothes. Move! Take it off. Last time he checked in was twelve hours ago. Location? Well? Inspector Wong. He checked in here, at the subject’s office, where we recorded the gunshots. Then he traveled 200 kilometers East. By 5 PM local time, the GPS signal went dead. It’s close to the border. Where is that? This area’s an un-designated international neutral zone. It’s nowhere. It looks like we're going on a holiday. You sleep there. Rent is paid in advance. I’m sorry. I don’t understand. Mony, come here. Yes? I heard you gamble with the Chinese. You tell him: Chinese pay double. You got to pay up, buddy. They already made me pay admission at the door. Tell him I’m squatting. All right. Maybe you can work something else out. Brother... ... he doesn’t think you deserve his money. Don't move! On your knees! Step back! If you want to make it easy for yourself, you have to learn how things work here, buddy. Room service. So... You're the one who’s been causing trouble, huh? There are rules to follow in my prison, and you are required to obey them. I’ve seen tough guys like you before. And it’s my job here to make them docile. To tame them. To reform them. And if there is one thing every man has in common, it's pain. That unbearable feeling. The breaking point. You have spirit! I like that. I should warn you, however, that I’ve made a hobby of this. I’m obsessed with those moments when man becomes animal. So let's see, if we can get there. You see? That’s better. Getting there. Come in. Mat! Warden! A pleasure to see you. Well... Who are the guests? This is Payak, an associate of mine. We share similar interests. It's an honor to be here. Mat told me all about it. I couldn't say no. Let’s hope it’s everything you wished for. And you must be Mr...? My nephew. T. Just call me T. ... Mr. T. A pleasure to meet you. All right, shall we? There. Excellent. With that out of the way... Please, take a seat. Over there. Gentlemen, you see this scotch? It's older than all of us. Mr. T, your contribution appears to be lacking. Actually everything is here. Thank you. Gentlemen. It’s a tradition of mine, to share a dram with honored guests. Gets the blood going. Instills the fight in a man. You will be dropped right here. Nothing but wilderness for 30 kilometers in any direction. You’ll have until sunset to enjoy the best damn afternoon money can buy. You’ll love it. I guarantee that. I swear. You can stab me in the chest if I’m lying. We want to help make this a fun, positive, and safe experience. T. Should I regret bringing you here? Okay, I guess I’ll just go then. Easy. Just relax, okay? Mat. Your nephew, huh? Who is this guy? I run a tight ship here, for discerning customers. You know? I know, but I had a hard time finding customers. He might look crazy, and well, okay... ... he is. But he has lots of money. He’s inherited my brother’s fortune. So don't worry. Gentlemen, just a moment. We're about to begin. Stir up the mice. Yes, sir. Warden. That one. On the tree. The one on the tree. Tattoos. In the corner. With tattoos. East wing. Mr. Payak... One left. If I may, I will choose your wild card? In the corner. Two o’clock. Okay. Good choice. Ok ladies. Playtime is over. Move away from the bars. Move away! On your knees. On the wall. Don't move! Don't move! Let's go! What's going on? I need a coffee. We’re almost there. In a row! Move! Let's go! Get down! Hurry up! Keep moving! Face forward. Do not look back! If you look back, you will be shot. When you hear a gun shot, Face forward! If you have a will to live, you will run to the jungle. You just might make it. But you have to be really fast. This one doesn’t count. Help me. Help! Please help me! Hurry. Shall we? 3-3-1. Hold on. 3-2-1. You said this one doesn’t count. No problem. Three left out there. Gentlemen. Your radios. Happy hunting. Come in. Ministry of State Security. How may I help you? I believe you have one of my men. He was in the group we sent to the jungle. Then say nothing. He’s been working undercover to bust a Mafia phone scam targeting Chinese citizens. I’m afraid there’s no one here by that name. He’s not here. Would it be possible to take a look at the inmate register? I’m sorry to waste your time but your man is not here. We don’t have him. Are you sure? Every man is accounted for. Besides, I never forget a face. Old school. We’re not going to run like this forever. Here. Come on. Let’s go! Just spotted the guy with the long gun up ahead. Keep an eye on him. Oh, shit! What the fuck! I’m sorry, sir. My son and I were just trying to catch some animals. No problem. Can you help me get out? Of course. One second. Thank you. Okay I’m Chay. This is my son, Sombath. You know... Let’s go. ... I think I’m going to buy a Ferrari with my prize money. Wait. You live around here? I’ve tracked this area my whole life. You know, I could really use... a man like yourself. I'm looking for some friends of mine, that got lost in the jungle. I’m really worried about them. Can you help me find them? I’m sorry, sir. I don't know how I can help you. I can make it worth your while. That's a start. I'll pay you more later. Good. I hope you know where we’re going. We’re heading in the opposite direction from where we came. That helps. Do you want to go back and face them all? Get down. Hurry. We can’t run. Listen carefully. You see that tree over there? Get to it. Fast. But he’ll see me. Exactly. You distract him. He’ll go after you, and when he’s close, I'll get him. Got it? Shit, man. Come on. There's no choice! Go! Now I am the tiger, and you are the prey. Go! Hurry. Let's go. He must be injured. He’s close. You see him? Yes, I see him. He's one of them. T, was that the space ray I just heard? Here we go. You two, let’s go. My legs! Who the fuck are you? What have I ever done to you? My legs! Don’t! Don’t! I didn’t want to lie to you. These aren’t my friends. They’re horrible, horrible people. But with your help, we’re going to take them down. Together. Let's go. Let’s make sure that the operation hasn’t been interrupted. And if necessary, we cover our tracks like before. Got it? Yes. What’s a prison warden need a money counting machine for? Maybe to count out the wages for his staff? He’s up to no good. Look... ... we’ll return as soon as possible, with the SWAT team, and tear that place apart. The signal is back. Let me see. It’s behind us. There. The signal’s right there. I can’t see him. But I can see the Warden. What’s going on here? What do you mean? This mess here. Nothing to concern you. A minor prison break. All under control. But it does concern us. How so? We have a GPS tracking device hidden in Detective Xin’s watch. Sir, they’ve been tracking him. Modern technology. Hey, you! Take a look at this. You may learn a thing or two. The tracking device leads us right here. The watch is on him. Let me have a look. You really should have stayed out of this. Oh, shit. Everything is gone. We have a man down. Copy? I repeat, man down. Mat, where are you? I’m 300 meters north-east from the starting point. The place with the cave. You copy? Copy. You understand what they’re saying? Yeah. They found the body. T, where are you? We’ve got a problem. Payak’s dead. These prisoners are armed. Watch out. Probably a smuggling tunnel. They were cooking heroin here, and not much else. Look around. All right, Mr. T. I think... ... I think we need to go now. My son and I... ... have to go back to the village. A storm is on its way. But we're almost done. We're right there. Here is the river. If we keep going north, we'll reach it. They can't track us over that. But... ... I thought we had a deal? I just don't get it. I thought we were friends. What do you have to say? Answer me, Chay. Good luck to you, Mr. T. Stop. Don't you take another step. I want you to check the shack over there. Finish what you started. Then we're done. Check the shack. Step back. They're here. All right! Double time! Hurry up! Go! She stays. Make camp close by. Okay. Mr. T... ... please my son... What happened, T? Who's in there? They’re mine. They killed my friend. You stay out of this. Listen, T. Payak is dead. This is not a game anymore. Get in position. What are you waiting for? Stay down! I can’t breathe, man! I can’t breathe. Don’t panic. Stay calm. Let's go. Let’s see what we’ve got. Nothing is here. Send the dog in. Get the bikes. Go to the other side. Quickly! Let’s clean up the mess. Take the body back to the camp. Keep an eye on the kid. Ryu, Key, follow them. T, where’re you going? Come on Mat! Let’s go. What’s that? I fucking hate dogs. Don’t look back. Hey! Where are you? Up here. Look at me. Come on, here! Pull. I see them. They're at the exit. Stand up. Hurry. Copy. I'm on my way. Watch out. Stand up. Hurry! Pon... Where are you? You copy? Pon, what’s happening? Are you receiving? Die! Die! Die! Relax! Relax! It's me. Relax. Calm down. It's me. It's me. Did you beat them? Listen. Let’s stop this. I'll handle it myself and send you back home. What about the money we paid? How about we double the entrance fee. And we keep the game going. What do you say, Warden? You’re fucking around with money you didn’t earn. Look who's talking. The kind of guy who walks away after getting his men killed. Runs back home... ... scared like a child. You're afraid, huh? Am I right? You’re just like my father. And you and me both know what happened to him. You’re right. We were the same. Both of us felt you should have been shot in the cradle. I’m in! Excellent. Warden. My car keys. Take it as a deposit. Who are you? I know lots of criminals. You’re not one of them. No average guy would’ve survived all this. But you did. Yeah. Thanks to you. This isn’t what I’m used to. I’m a thief. Not a killer. How do you say 'water?' They’re not going catch these guys. We are. Understand? Now get the girl. How do you say 'friend?' Go ahead. Xin? Xin, are you there? Are you there? I’m listening. We know who you are. Your friends told us. Friends? The Inspector and the lady. This is about me. Great. So let’s end it now. Surrender. We’ll hand you back to your people. Let me speak to them. Xin. Wong’s dead. They’ll kill me either way. Don’t listen... She’s being uncooperative. Remember that breaking point, Warden? I’m past it. Beyond pain. Beyond fear. Beyond all joy except for the satisfaction of watching you face justice. Trust me, Warden, if you even touch her, I will break you. What did he say? We probably have some more negotiating to do. You can follow the river tomorrow. I can take care of this. No. I’m coming with you. You stay here. Cover my back. I'll wait here. Be careful. I thought you were asleep. Be careful out here. Friend. Motherfucker! Commander... commander... you copy? Go ahead, sir. We are under attack. The prisoners ambushed our camp. What’s your location? About 500 meters from the village. You still there? Hang in there a little longer. What are you looking at? You sick bastard! T! Don't shoot! You still there? Wake up. What happened? Father is dead. Come on, wake up. Wake up! Who are they? They're my friends. Please wake up. What do we do? What do we do now? They're coming for us. They'll hurt us. Or maybe not. This time will be different, like Dad said? Where's Dad now? What did he do for us? We made Dad angry. He put us away. We embarrassed him. We weren’t like him. Stay here. Hide. They’re getting closer. They'll take us back to the big building in the woods. They’ll clean us up. We'll have a new outfit. A new room. And this will all be over. I am not going back! Get away! Away! Fire! More are coming. Let's go! Keep moving. Sir, we found him. Drop the gun! Drop the gun! I'm not going back! Not going back! You won't take me back. Then you can stay here. Crazy bastard. Let's go find the others. Move! Yes. The village is under attack. Yes. Some of our people are missing. We've got to rescue them. This time we fight back. When we’ve got everyone here, get them into the woods. Okay? Come on. Let's go. Get out! Move! I beg you. Where are they? Where? I don't know anything. Please. I'm sorry. Where are they? Speak! Friends. Friends. I could have shipped you all off. Turned this place into a plantation. But here you are. So stupid... ... and ungrateful. So. Not so tough anymore huh? I locked them up. I brought in the worst of them. All I did... ... was give society the privilege of paying the fuckers back. You thought hell was just a fairy tale? I’ve made it real. Xin... ... see what you’ve become. Just like an animal. I’ve broken you. I’ve...
