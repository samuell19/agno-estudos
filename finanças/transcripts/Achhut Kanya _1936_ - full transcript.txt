The gate can't open. 12.50 train is arriving. It isn't 12 yet. What's my fault in it, sir? I just can't open the gate before 1 O'clock. Between 12 and 1.. Ghosts come here. Ghosts. All right. Here you go. Lord Rama. How did it come to you? It fell from your pocket. "Krishna lives in the entire universe." "Krishna lives in the entire universe." "In water, in land, in sky and in air." "In water, in land, in sky and in air." "In tall and short houses." "In tall and short houses." "Radha stays in his flowers." Go back. Is your dear Narendra sitting here for which you've come? "Radha stays in his flowers." "Krishna lives in the entire universe." "Krishna lives in the entire universe." He sacrificed his life. To save the lives of others. Yes. He sacrificed his life. To save the lives of others. She was Goddess. Yes, Goddess. Untouchable by birth. But Goddess by her actions. Her life story is a pious story. Hearing and narrating it gives peace the soul. Peace. Narrate it to me as well. All right. I pull curtain from the past world. So that you see for yourself, listen and experience. She loved him more than her own life. Because he wasn't like other boys. What will you feel if someone puts you in a cage? I'll feel very bad. - Isn't it, Kasturi? - Yes. If you show a red flag, the train stops. If you show a green flag, the train goes. My father is richer than your father. He can stop all trains. And my father won't give flour. The whole village will die of hunger. Tell me. The boy belonged to the Brahmin caste. And girl, untouchable. Still their fathers were best friends with each other. Because. - What happened? - What happened? It's a snake bite. We've called for a physician. Nothing to worry. I sucked all the poison. Please forgive me, priest. I touched you. What do I do? Your life was a risk. Childhood passed as time passed. Kasturi. Pratap. Where are you going? I am going to the nearby village to bring cereals. - Come on, you also come. - All right. Brother, Mohanlal. Now you stop visiting our house. You belong to a high caste, we low. Entire village has become your enemy because of this. Brother. Your and my relationship is not about high and low. Can I ever forget.. That you risked your life to save mine? What you did for me.. A brother doesn't do it for another brother. Whole village knows this. Actually, this physician, Babulal. He instigates people against you and me. Why's Babulal jealous of you? I don't like that. I sell quinine to the villagers.. No one takes medicines from the poor guy. This is it. Hey? How's your daughter? You took the medicine that day. Why didn't you come again? Physician, your medicine didn't have any effect. She quickly recovered with Mohanlal's medicine. What? Last 15 generations, my forefathers have been practicing medicine. And you say that your medicine didn't have any effect. Wait and watch. If I don't take revenge of this insult from you and your Mohanlal. Then, don't call me physician Babulal. "Raddish from the field and mango from the orchard." "I am a boy, you are the price." "Raddish from the field and mango from the orchard." "I am a boy, you are the price." "The clouds of rain." "Don't be careless about me." "Eye kohl at evening." "In the night it looks like kohl in the eyes." "A mould of jaggery." "Stays together like Bela and jasmine." "A mould of jaggery." "Stays together like Bela and jasmine." "Raddish from the field and mango from the orchard." "I am a boy, you are the price." The train's coming. Go, close the gate. Yes, go. I too will go to the shop. Pratap's mother. Hey, Pratap's mother. Who? Rambi's daughter-in-law? Yes. I touch your feet. May your husband live long. May you bear a son. What brings you here? Nanu's mother has called you. Guests are coming to their house tomorrow. There's a lot of work to be done today. Even I have lots of work to do. I haven't wrapped up the morning work yet. Anyways, you go. I'll wrap up and come. Have they called someone else? Yes, yes. They've called everyone. There's a lot of work. Grinding flour. Grains are to be cleaned. Rice is to be beaten. Kasturi. Hey, Kasturi. Hey, where are you? Coming, father. I'll be back. Where were you all this while? You won't say. Dumb girl. Here you go. Bring some flour and pulses from uncle Mohan's shop. Should I tell you where I was? I was roaming in the car with Pratap. Hey? God has given me such a naughty daughter. I need to find a groom for her soon. I've found one. Is it? Child. You're not so lucky. Why? You'll get married to a guy of my choice. Don't you like Pratap? Do it, father. Chose him. You need a witch like mother-in-law to control you. Pratap's mother is very simple. "River, flow slowly. Flow slowly, I am entering." "River, flow slowly. Flow slowly, I am entering." "Why your boat and why your sail?" "Why your boat and why your sail?" "Which sailor of yours will take me to the other side?" "Which sailor of yours will take me to the other side?" "River, flow slowly. Flow slowly, I am entering," "River, flow slowly. Flow slowly, I am entering," "My boat sails, the sail flutters." "My boat sails, the sail flutters." "True my boat, my sailor, I want to cross over." "True my boat, my sailor, I want to cross over." "River, flow slowly. Flow slowly, I am entering," "River, flow slowly. Flow slowly, I am entering," How's your son today? The fever is not there, but there's a lot of weakness. Brother, it's Malaria. It takes a toll. Are you giving him quinine everyday? His mother went to the physician. He stopped quinine. And started other medicine. Now suffer. I gave you quinine for free. But you're not satisfied without filling Babulal's pockets. She went. The physician said that sickness is not cured without spending money. Don't fall for his words. There's no better medicine than quinine for Malaria. Take. Take one more dose. Go and give him. Give me massage oil. Just this much? How much more? Should I pour the whole tin? Okay, give me at least little more. Do you want little more? Give me a drop for my head. Here you go. But don't use it on this marble terrace. Massage it on the body. It will show result. Am I a monkey.. To massage oil on the body and grow hair? Wow! You're just like that. Does oil massage give hair or strength? Go and get an oil massage. Sleep on tamarind leaves. Enough, Mohanlal. Mind your tongue. Physician Babulal was right, that you're a fraud. You like to take others money. And bothering to give stuff. Dishonest. Where's Pratap? He doesn't help me in anything. He' still young. Must be playing somewhere. Stop. Go, go to the shop. I'll unload the stock. No, no. We'll go together. Come, let's quickly take down the stock. Come on. You won't unload. This is men's task. Is it? Let me see. Enough. I told you, but who'll understand. Come on, you pick up the sack. This is women's task. You are too lenient with Pratap. He must be sitting and chatting with that Kasturi. Did you forget those days.. When like Pratap and Kasturi, in childhood.. Jumped around the well all day? It was different with us. You and me belonged to the same caste. Kasturi and Pratap? God forbid! Hey. 25 paise have come. What will you do with money? Take groceries. I don't want groceries. I want money. Good. Here you go. Give me 25 paise. Don't worry. You must have forgotten it somewhere. Yes, left it somewhere. Let it be, if it's left. Give it later. Brother, no matter what physician Babulal says. No person in the entire village is as kind as you. Let him talk. Do you know.. What the ancient wise people have written? Hey, for me a black alphabet resembles a buffalo. You tell. They've written. He who has intelligence also has the capability to understand. It's right. You have both intelligence and the capability to understand. Where were you, Pratap? He was with me. All right. All right. Fine. But, Pratap. Now you've grown up. You should support your old parents. Kasturi, what will you have, child? Groceries for today's meal. Flour, pulses. Clarified butter, rice, salt. Oh! You have just 1 paise in the knot. But the queen shows such attitude. As if she'll buy the whole shop. What will you buy in 1 paise? How would I know? It's your shop. Give me whatever you can. I just know to cook food. Look at her. What all can you cook? If you don't believe, ask father. Yes. He'll praise you. All right, ask Pratap. He too has eaten the food cooked by me. Pratap? Pratap? Did you eat food cooked by Kasturi? She cooks good food, mother. Answer what I ask. Did you eat food cooked by her or no? I did eat, mother. Have you lost it? Being the son of a Brahmin, you eat food cooked by her? Mother, don't get angry. I won't give him food in the future. Child, go and cook food. Father must be hungry. Pratap. Mother, I swear. I won't let him eat ever. Pratap, go. Deliver this stuff to Kasturi's house. Come back soon for the meal. He's still a kid. Let him play for some more days. Will they remain kids all their life? Now they've become of marriageable age. Yes. They'll make a good pair. What? Yes, I said. If Kasturi belonged to our caste. She would have been so good for Pratap. If she was. But she's the daughter of an untouchable. I don't like them meeting each other. You're right. They are too attached to each other. Anyways, there's still time. We'll find a girl for Pratap. And tell Dukhiya.. To find a groom for Kasturi as well. I'll keep this and be right back. "I'll become a sparrow of the forest and sing in the forest." "I'll become a bird of the forest and dance with you." "I'll become a sparrow of the forest and sing in the forest." "I'll become a bird of the forest and dance with you." "I'll fly from one branch to another." "I won't come in your hands." "I'll fly from one branch to another." "I won't come in your hands." "You on branches, I on leaves." "I'll definitely catch you." "I'll dance with you." "You on branches, I on leaves." "I'll definitely catch you." "I'll dance with you." "I'll sing in the forest." "I'll become a sparrow of the forest and sing in the forest." "I'll become a bird of the forest and dance with you." "I'll become a sparrow of the forest and sing in the forest." "I'll dance with you." Babulal, did you hear this? Mohanlal said that you don't know medicine. Ashes in his mouth. My forefathers have been practicing medicine for the last 15 generations. And, I don't understand medicine? Mohan has become a doctor by storing a 2 1/2 pill of quinine. Anyways, kid. If I don't make you forget medicine, my name is not physician Babulal. You have fever. Hey, no. I don't have fever. No fever. If you don't have fever why are you wailing? I say, you have fever. Hey, haven't. How do I believe? You'll not believe like this. Are you the physician or me? If I've said that you have fever, the fever has to be there. My forefathers have been practicing medicine for the last 15 generations. One feels cold before getting fever. But I am not feeling cold at all. Tell me. How do I make these illiterate understand? That's why Mohan has the courage.. To consider these people as fools. Hey, but I haven't gone to Mohanlal. Good, you're saved. Or else he would've said that you don't have fever. But, physician Babulal doesn't know how to agree with the patients. Yes, so. For how many days have you been getting fever? Physician, I am telling you. I don't have fever. I don't feel cold. When did I say that you're feeling cold? Does one feel cold or hot in fever? Hey, but I don't feel hot either. Huh? You are in a scary state. You neither feel hot nor cold. Then, what do you feel? Let me see. Show me your stomach. Stomach. Physician, how did you come to know.. That there is pain in my stomach? Stomach? I can even tell the condition of your heart. My name is physician Babulal. My forefathers have been practicing medicine for the last 15 generations. I found out as soon as I saw your face.. That you have a stomach fever. You're right, brother. The girl has grown up. I should get her married now. Yes. We are getting Pratap also married. His mother has gone to meet a girl. With God's grace, Pratap will get many proposals. But, who'll marry Kasturi without any dowry? You don't worry about that. Whatever dowry Pratap gets.. We'll give it in Kasturi's marriage. Hey, brother. How's this possible? I can't forget your past favors. Forget that. But, remember. The way Kasturi is your daughter, she is mine as well. I'll get her married. Did you hear? The other day. I was telling Pratap's mother. Kasturi and Pratap make a good couple. Dukhiya, it would have been better if both of us belonged to the same caste. Yes, brother. Both of them can die for each other. I know. Since Pratap's mother told him not to meet.. Both of them are restless. Kasturi comes to see Pratap on some or the other pretext everyday. But the poor girl returns scaring his mother. Mother says that it's not good for us to play together. She says that we're not kids anymore. There was nothing wrong with the childhood. What's wrong if we play together now? Does one have to find new friends on growing up? When I'll grow up, I won't have to follow mother's orders. And then we can continue playing together. No, no. Even after growing up, you'll have to follow your mother's orders. Why? Father didn't listen to granny either. She used to stop him a lot. But father never stopped giving groceries to the people on credit. She didn't even like your father and my father meeting. - And. - We're untouchables. Everyone thinks that we are bad. Not everyone, Kasturi. Father mingles with father all the time. Yes, but now we won't be able to mingle anymore. Everyone says the girl is good. Good and bad is known after testing. Now you need to check how she looks. Yes, if the daughter-in-law is pretty, Pratap will forget Kasturi. Come, child. Will you come to our house? I don't have a daughter. She's very shy. My Pratap is also very shy. They'll make a good couple. All right. Now let's discuss the dowry. I don't want anything. I am getting my son married. I am not trading him for anything. You can give whatever you want, to your daughter. Meera? Are you getting married? With God's grace, your husband shouldn't be like mine. He doesn't even come near me. I'll go and live in their house. But, your parents want your husband to be a son-in-law who stays with them. Child. Things change with time. What you did childhood, can't be done now. What you do now, you may not do in the future. Father. One can't lose childhood friends. You are the one who said. Either you don't make friends with anyone. Or, if you do, then stay true to it till the end. Playing together was not wrong in childhood. How did it become now? Who'll argue with you? I don't argue, father. I want to know. Don't you hear, father? I do, child. Then, tell me. Answer me. God has given you birth in the house of an untouchable. And, Pratap in a Brahmin's house. Then, why should we lost our friendship because of this? Child. This is a society. Here you get both joys and sorrows. A person should not give up. Time takes away all the sorrows. Now we have lot of evidence. Let's call a village court and throw that Mohanlal out of our caste. He was being so smart. But physician. The village court will ask for proof. Yes. I've heard it with my ears. Mohan's son ate food at Dukhiya's house. Yes, you heard but did you see? Yes. I saw. Mohan has fixed his son's marriage to Kasturi in front of me. This is a proper evidence. Let the marriage take place first. Then you say. Yes. Mohan has taken you on his side by giving you free quinine, hasn't he? I am not on any side. I am friends with him as well as you. I don't have enmity with anyone. But, I do. - That day Mohan called me a monkey. - What? I'll teach him a lesson. And that day, when I gave him 25 paise and asked for change.. He started calling me an owl and a donkey. If I don't take a revenge for this, my name is not Ghasita. And my name is also not physician Babulal if I don't kill his ego. My last 15 generations of forefathers. You hear it from this ear or that. I won't agree without taking any dowry in Pratap's marriage. You'll take when you get it. I've refused those people. No matter how much you refuse. I'll take dowry. Why? To give these poor villagers? Not to give to these poor villagers. In fact, for Dukhiya's daughter. Then say that.. You're more worried for Dukhiya's daughter than your own son. Poor Dukhiya. He's my only companion in joys and sorrows. All right. I am saying. You won't get dowry in Pratap's marriage. And, I also tell you. I will and surely will. Or else the marriage will not take place. Am I his mother or you? Am I his father or you? I've refused them. And I've promised Dukhiya. Great. Whatever jewellery I have, I'll give it in Kasturi's marriage. "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" "The boat sinks." "The boat sinks." "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Had I known this." "Love gives this pain." "But I'm saying to everyone." "No one would have fallen in love." "He has left me in troubled times." "He has left me in troubled times." "He has left me in troubled times." "The boat sinks." "The boat sinks." "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" "My friends have separated from me." "The boatman, my life partner." "My friends have separated from me." "The boatman, my life partner." "The boatman, my life partner." "Who'll take it to the coast?" "Who'll take it to the coast?" "Who'll take it to the coast?" "The boat sinks." "The boat sinks." "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" "Where have you gone, sailer?" Kasturi. - Did you get scared? - No. Have you come with the wedding invitation? Whether you invite me or not. I'll definitely come. Mother and father have taken up the task of inviting. All right. - Will you go to your in-laws place tomorrow? - Yes. I feel like accompanying you to see the daughter-in-law. How's she? I haven't seen her yet. Mother must have told you. Kasturi, wouldn't it be better.. If you also got married with me? I will. May God give you a good groom. May Lord Rama give you a good wife. Kasturi. 7 Down, train is coming. I can't stand. You go and wave the flag. Where's your father? Won't he see the daughter-in-law? He's lying sick. He can't even sit. I would like to see him. She's so pretty. How will poor Kasturi look after you? You come to my house. Will you make me your friend? Yes, why not? Child, I am taking Dukhiya to my house. He needs proper care. You'll mange the work here, will you? Yes. But how'll I stay alone without father? Don't be scared, child. Your father will get well and come back soon. And when you feel scared, come there. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up. Child. Look. Closing the gate.. And giving the signal.. It shouldn't go wrong. We are responsible for hundreds of lives. That's why I am bringing Dukhiya here. All right. Poor guy is sick. Untouchables are also humans. Then, we don't have to eat with him. Kalyani, you're indeed Kalyani. Wow! The dice has fallen so well. Now Mohan is trapped. Why? What happened? Has Mohan got his son married? Yes, and Dukhiya also brought an untouchable to his house. Hey, what are you saying? Has Mohan made him stay in his house openly? Yes. I've seen with my eyes. Now the pot of his evils is filled. Let's go. Let's throw the dirt out of the village. He calls himself a Brahmin. Rascal. He pretends to be a doctor. Doctor. We won't tolerate. Come on. Throw him out. Is it true that Dukhiya is staying in your house? Yes, what have you got to do with it? What have you got to do with it? Throw him out. Throw him out. Mohan has made polluted his religion. We won't let him stay in this village. And, you've kept a dirty man in the house. Do Brahmins do this? - No, no. - Throw him out. - This is not possible. - Hello. Am I not a Brahmin? Don't I help the poor? Yes. Don't I treat the untouchables? - Yes. - I do. But, I don't make them sit in my house. Yes, true. Do you know, why? Because I am a true Brahmin. Yes, true. I believe in my religion. I have faith and trust. - Yes, true. - He's right. And there's he, who calls himself a Brahmin. And makes an untouchable stay in his house. - Kill him. - Kill him. Throw him out of the house, society, religion and the village. Listen, listen. If you want to throw me out.. Go ahead. But tell me. Aren't untouchables humans? Don't they have life like us and the feeling of joys and sorrows? What Brahmin? What scavenger? Everyone is the child of the same father. Where.. Sun, water. Air, land. Is open for everyone. If God's don't discriminate.. What right do we humans have to indulge in caste discrimination? You tell me. You're a physician. Is the fever of Brahmins different in medicine? And different for the untouchables? Do Brahmins have a different cholera.. And scavengers different? It's the duty of the man to serve. Dukhiya is sick. He needs my care. Yes. You're absolutely right. Entire village needs your care. Yes. Whether they need or not, Dukhiya does. He is my companion. Unless he doesn't become all right, he'll stay here. This is my personal matter, you don't. Come on, throw him out. Listen. This is his personal matter. We should not interfere in this. Our religion is becoming polluted. Our name is being maligned. And he says we shouldn't interfere in this. Damn you. Yes. Landlords. You're being unjust to Mohanlal. There isn't any other kind and true Brahmin like him in the village. Hey, I am at fault. You are unnecessarily getting angry on him. I am going right away. No. No. Dukhiya, you stay here. I don't care for their threats. Till the time me and my house are there.. No one can throw you out of this. Go! Go! Go and do whatever you want to. - What did you say? - Go! Do whatever you want to. I don't care. Go! What are you watching? Throw him out of the house. Come on. Come on! Yes. My dear. My dear. The rascals killed him. No, still there's life. There's no doctor or a physician close by. - I'll go to the city. - No, you wait here. No new problem should erupt again. Somehow I'll call the railway doctor from the junction. Hey, let's go. Mohan called me a monkey when I asked him for a drop of honey. I'll teach him a lesson now. You wait. I'll see. Give. Give me the flag. The post can needs to be stopped. Stupid. Let your brother go to hell. With whose orders did you stop the vehicle? Wait, I'll report about you. Chief, you do whatever you want to, to me. By please feel pity on my brother Mohan's condition. He's dying. There's no doctor here. I'll bring the doctor from the junction. Please take me. Get aside, you mad. Start the van. Oh God! Father! Father! Now the priest will enjoy for calling me a monkey. Father! Father! Hey, what kind of an evil person are you? A Brahmin's house is on fire and you're just watching the scene. Come on. Bring water. Kasturi. I couldn't do anything for brother Mohan. Now I have faith only in God. No, no. Let's go. Let's go and see brother Mohan. Hey, police! Father. Is it your duty on this crossing? Yes, sir. Where's Dukhiya? He's gone to fetch a doctor from the junction for you. Hey, why did you send him? Poor guy himself is dying. Is junction close by? Poor guy must have fallen on the road. I'll go and see. Hey priest, you don't get up. I'll go. Yes. I've got a message from the guard of the postal van.. That there were riots in this village. - Do you know anything? - Yes, sir. I saw it myself. That physician Babulal is the root of this problem. He destroyed us. You're the root of this problem. - You've used us. - You're used us. - You! You are the root of the trouble. I put Mohan's shop on fire because of your instigation. - And also put his house on fire. - Yes, this is it. - Hey, the police is here. - Police! - Yes. I just saw the inspector go towards Dukhiya's house. Oh God! All will be doomed. Why're you dying? If Mohan's son has called the police.. Then, mind you. He won't be spared. All of us will deny everything. But only if the inspector believes us. Hey, my name is physician Babulal. I have a medicine for the power of police as well. - Why are you scared? - Police! I'll go to the village for investigations. If the need arises, I'll call for you. Salute inspector. Salute. If the sir permits me, I'll narrate everything. All this is that doing of that physician Babulal. He has instigated the villagers.. Got them to beat up Mohan and put his house on fire. What? He even burnt his house? God! What injustice is this? Have uncle Mohan, Pratap, aunt and Meera. Are everyone saved, or? Don't be scared. Everyone is saved. I congratulate Pratap. He saved Mohan from the burning fire. I'll go and investigate. If Mohanlal is in able.. Quickly reach there along with him. Very good, sir. You be here. You'll be called if the need arises. Brother, Mohan. I tried to make you understand a number of times. To stay away from us untouchables. But you didn't listen. Darn! You landed into this problem because of us. God! God! I'll go, father. I'll go and see what state those poor guys are in. Hari? They are coming. Dukhiya, you've been sacked. Vacate the cabin right now and give the keys to him. Why are you staring at my face? Go and vacate the cabin. Yes, sir. All right, sir. All right, now we'll go. Work attentively. Yes. I'll go and bring our belongings from the cabin. But where will we go, father? Why do you feel bad? Let the house burn if it has burnt. He who has given us head, will also give us shelter. You don't worry, brother. These trees are standing. We'll spend the day peacefully under their shade. What's in it to fear? Pratap is there. I am there. We'll soon build a new house. Till then you stay in my house. Pratap, you go ahead with mother and daughter-in-law. By then brother Mohan and I will handle the investigations. Hey, may your enemies live under the trees. You stay in this cabin till you don't get work. Brother, you're very kind. Since how many days have you been working? Where are you from? What's your name and caste? Hey, my name is Mannu. My father used to often talk about you. I am Dhannu's son. Dhannu's son? You were so small when I last saw you. Now you've become a youth. Dhannu and I left the village together to work for the company. Kasturi, he's not a stranger. He's from our village. I was friends with his father Dhannu.. Just the way I am with Mohan. Yes. And you both.. Had also got engaged in the childhood. So sir, I won't let you go anywhere now. No, brother. We should not break the law. Sir has told me to vacate the cabin. - So. - You have vacated it. What problem does anyone have if I bring my family in this cabin? Come on. Come on, come one. Tell me the truth without any fear. Who started this fight? Who all were a part of this? Who put Mohanlal's shop on fire? Who. Tell me. Was it anyone from these? Tell me. Salute, inspector. Salute. Salute, inspector. Salute. Hey, who is this for? For sir. What did you say? For sir? No, sir. It was a mistake. He wants to bribe you. Lord Rama. Lord Rama. Sir, taking and giving bribe is unlawful. Bhawani. Bhawani. Say Bhawani later. First tell me your name. Name? Sir, my name's physician Babulal. So, you are physician Babulal. Has sir heard my name? Why not? For the last 15 generations, my forefathers. Who's asking about your forefathers? We are bothered about you. And this fight. Which fight, sir? Oh! As if the poor guy doesn't know anything. Sir, the fight.. In which you happily broke Mohanlal's head.. And put his shop on fire. No, sir. To trap us poor.. He broke his head himself. And also put his shop on fire. All right. So, Mohanlal is mad. Absolutely, sir. Absolutely mad. Ask all of them. They know everything. If Mohan was not mad, he would have sold clove oil in his craze. By fooling us who belonged to the superior caste.. - Would he make friends with an untouchable? - Stop it. Don't talk rubbish. I know all you miscreants very well. Sir, you become a deputy and decide about us. Yes, you are our deputy, master. We accept sir, that we fought with Mohanlal. But we were fed up of him, sir. All right, inspector. These people must have surely been fed up of my headstrong nature. All right. So, are you Mohanlal? Still I'll have to file complaint them. Therefore, you file a proper report. And investigate them. Sir, neither do I have any complaints about anyone.. Nor can I investigate anyone. But. The crime is serious. Therefore, these people.. Will have to a face a trial from the government. Arrest them and take them to the police station. No. No, master. We'll die, master. "The bird flies in the air singing this song." "Come my dear, we'll play the game of love." "The bird flies in the air singing this song." "Come my dear, we'll play the game of love." "Flies along with the bird." "The colorful river of the heart." "Flies along with the bird." "The colorful river of the heart." "Me sorrowful, I am separated." "Whom should I play with?" "Me sorrowful, I am separated." "Whom should I play with?" "The bird flies in the air singing this song." "Come my dear, we'll play the game of love." Tell me, sister. Hope you're fine. It's been so many days. You didn't even think of us. What can I say, sister? It was a bad time. As soon as I stepped in my marital home.. A mountain of sorrow collapsed. The house got burnt. Father-in-law's head broke. I know, sister. It's not your fault in this. We people are at fault. New daughter-in-law brings happiness and prosperity to her in-laws. But since I came.. I don't know why, we are facing calamities one after the other. And what's sorrowful is.. That, he too thinks the same. No, sister. Why do you say so? Why does he remain upset? I regret the fact.. That I couldn't make him happy. Does he stay away from you? He doesn't stay away from anyone. His nature is so good. What hurts me is.. That, he talks and mingles with everyone. But his mind is somewhere else. Sister. You haven't read his nature yet. He definitely loves you. Don't worry. What can I do, sister? My mind doesn't agree. I know.. That he respects me a lot. He talks and laughs with me. But, his mind is somewhere else. No, no. You're his wife. Where else can his mind be if not with you? What? Do all husbands love their wives? You don't know about Kajri. She stays close to our house. And belongs to your caste. It's been years since she got married. And her husband doesn't even come near her. Kajri's parents have sent me to see.. Whether you're actually re marrying. What do I do if I don't? They don't send Kajri. They are ready to give you their house and their property. - But you don't agree. - I may be poor. But living on in-law's food, is not acceptable to me. Brother. Mannu looks a decent man. If he didn't have another wife.. I would definitely get Kasturi married to him. Hey, what's in it to think? I too had two mothers. But they never fought. If you advise, then I'll get Kasturi married. Mannu has done big favor on us. Is your alliance with Dukhiya's daughter is fixed? Father had got the both of us engaged when we were kids. Now destiny has brought us together again. It's a matter of co-incidence. Sure. What problem do they have if I am getting married? Go tell them, I don't care. - Who's he, sir? - Who? She, who's laughing looking at you? She? She stays in this village. One is the wife of my acquaintance. - And the other. - Yes, I am asking about the other. She's Dukhiya's daughter, isn't she? How do you know? When I was searching for you.. She was standing outside Dukhiya's hut. That's why you're re marrying, master. Why? You're very innocent. Kajri is not even equal to the dust beneath her feet. Why, brother? Kasturi will be happy with Mannu. There's no doubt about it. No. What's in it to doubt? Our Kasturi is a very innocent and content girl. No matter how you keep her, she'll be happy. She'll quietly suffer even if she's in sorrow. What say, daughter? Your father found a groom for you before me. Is it? Oh! Very innocent. As if she doesn't know anything? Who the groom is? How would I know? How would I know? Hey, listen. Sweetmeats are jumping in your mind. And on top of it. Stop it, uncle. A daughter is born to be given away. Yes, but with whom? With the one of her caste. Who else? Did you see the cheat? She fooled me. "Whom would the mad love? Who's yours?" "Whom would the mad love? Who's yours?" "Who's yours? Who's yours? Who's yours?" "Who's yours? Who's yours? Who's yours?" "Whom would the mad love? Who's yours?" "The relationships of the world are fake." "The customs of the world are fake." "The worldly meetings are fake. The customs of the world are fake." "You don't have any friend, dear. Who's yours." "Whom would the mad love? Who's yours?" "You don't have any destination." "What was mine belongs to someone else." "This life is a burden. Who's yours?" "Whom would the mad love? Who's yours?" "Who's yours? Who's yours? Who's yours?" "Whom would the mad love? Who's yours?" Where had you been? To Dukhiya. Listen to one spicy news. What? Kasturi's marriage is fixed. And luckily we found a nice groom. Mannu, who's come in place of Dukhiya. But how do we arrange the money? I had a wish. The way we got Pratap married. Similarly, we should get Kasturi married. Yes. Mannu, you blame your parents. Neither had they stopped you from going to her house.. Nor would he remarry. Has he got married? I don't know properly. All right. I'll go and find out. I just know.. That I love you. Kasturi. Listen to me. Come, let's elope. Won't you come, Kasturi? Pratap. No, Pratap. I can't do this. Our match is not destined. You are a Brahmin. I, and untouchable. Pratap. I can't get away from this marriage. God! Why didn't you make me an untouchable as well? - Didn't you hear? Kajri won't go. - Yes. Uncle, if Mannu is her husband.. Let her go if she wants to go to him. What did you say? Let her go. Yes, I'll go. And definitely go. Did you hear? She'll go. Keep quiet, Kajri. Small mouth and big talks. Why? I am not a kid to keep quiet. So what if he's remarried. I too am wedded to him. How can he leave me? Hey, if he cared for you, he would have come. We gave him the house, the property. But he kicked everything. He called me so many times. But did you send me? I'll go and definitely go. These are modern times. Modern times. A feet long girl and mile long tongue. Had I said something like this, my parents would have skinned me. Try touching me. Yes! Try touching me. This is the only cure for women. The ghosts who understand beatings, don't agree with words. You may break my bones, I'll not agree without going. Whom will you go to? He won't even spit on your face. His wife is more beautiful than you. When did I say that she is prettier than Kajri? Let her be if she is. Let me see, which fairyland's fairy she is. Yes. You're also jealous of that fairlyland's fairy. Yes, jealous. Who's she to take away my right? Here she's talking about rights. Try going. Look. Kasturi. Are you happy after getting married to me? My joys lie in your joys. My happiness lies in your happiness. I always experience a void in my life. You've filled it. My heart, was lonely. You've prospered it. As days pass.. Your love makes a place for itself in my heart. You're very kind. You've done a lot of favors on father and me. "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Where have you gone, boatman?" "The boat sinks. The boat sinks." "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Had I known that love is painful." "In the whole city, no one would fall in love with anyone." "You've left me in trouble." "You've left me in trouble." "You've left me in trouble." "The boat sinks." "The boat sinks." "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Where have you gone, boatman?" Kasturi, these tears? Why? What's your grief? Nothing. Nothing. Just like that. This mind doesn't agree. Save me. Protect me, Lord. "My companions have been separated from me." "The boatman, life partner." "My companions have been separated from me." "The boatman, life partner." "The boatman, life partner." "Who'll take me to the shore?" "Who'll take me to the shore?" "Who'll take me to the shore?" "The boat sinks." "The boat sinks." "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Where have you gone, boatman?" "Where have you gone, boatman?" So what? I too am wedded to him. Your daughter might get married to him. She can't snatch my right. No matter how many times a person marries. But, which justice is this? That he keeps one in the house and not even see the other's face? Do you love someone else? Tell me. How do I tell you? God! Why are you giving me one grief after the other? I've hurt you further by asking. Please forgive me. No, Meera. You forgive me. I destroyed your life. I was yours because of the promise. But, I couldn't be yours from my mind. My heart knows how much I tried. But, all in vain. Till now, no one knew about this secret. Today, I'll tell you. Come, sister. I am your younger sister. Snatching an elder sister's right will be a sin. Come. I'll serve the both of you. Come, sister. Come. So you love Kasturi? No, no. I have no right to do that. You are my wife, Meera. I should love you. I'll love you. Meera. I want to be yours. If I can make you happy even after giving my life.. Then, I'll consider that my life was worth it. God! Show me the way. Meera. I belong to Kasturi. And I'll belong to her forever. I love her, and therefore I have married her. So what? You're my master. I am your wedded wife. How can I live my right? Where were you all this while? Now you've come to destroy my happily married life. You have married with other girl. Till now I had hope.. That someday you'll definitely come to me. - But. - I won't come to you ever. That's why I've come to you. Throw me out if you can. No, I can't throw you out. But I can go. Go wherever you want to. I too will come along. Ruthless. Merciless. Evil. Hey, I would've sent her back. But Kasturi didn't agree. Kasturi has a different nature. Yes. She has neither worry nor fear. On top of it, she handed over her husband to the other woman. After all, what will be the conclusion? She's your first wife. How can I take away her right? But, I love you, Kasturi. I love you. I am not worthy of this. The way your first wife can love you.. I can't. Kasturi, are you testing my love? Or, are you saying this on behalf of Kajri to change my mind? Tell me. Tell me, Kasturi. You love me, do you? Who? Kajri? Hey! Meera! What brings you here? To my husband. Husband? Who? Mannu. Why are you so sad, Kasturi? Won't you tell me either? Don't ask. Don't ask. I don't know anything. I just know.. That, it's my duty to serve you. Destiny made us meet co-incidentally. And, no one can escape destiny. Kasturi, do you want to escape? From me? You are my God. It's evil even if I think like this. Kasturi doesn't love Mannu. That's why she was so hospitable towards me. Will any woman hand over her husband to the other woman like this? She can. I can. Then you may not be loving your husband? God knows, how much I love. But he doesn't love me. He loves Kasturi. No. Both have played together since childhood. Spent time together. He can't forget her. Kasturi! I think, she too loves him. Then say it this way. Kasturi is the cause of all problem. She has destroyed our and our husband's lives. Why? What brings you here? Just like that. How like that? Is anything wrong in coming to our husband? With great difficulty I've got the chance to talk to you in private. What talk? It's been so long since I came. But, you didn't even look at me. What can I do? Your destiny. But your and my destiny is one. And, even Kasturi's. Tell me, Pratap. Where are you headed? Brother, I've taken a shop in the Nishanpur fair. You know, since the time we've had the fight with Babulal.. People have stopped buying groceries from our shop. So, we decided, let's earn something in the fair. Yes, it's good. You also come along. I would've come. But I have to report to the station today. Alright, go. With God's grace, you should have good sales. - Good bye. - Good bye. Hey, listen. "Why are you talking about pain?" "No one understands your pain." "Why are you talking about pain?" "No one understands your pain." "No one understands what your heart is going through." "No one understands your pain." "The wounded understands the condition of the wounded, and no one else." "The wounded understands the condition of the wounded, and no one else." "Why are you talking about pain?" "No one understands your pain." "Why are you talking about pain?" "No one understands your pain." Kajri. What? What are you thinking? Same old story. Kasturi, I am going to bring the salary. You do the task of showing the flag. All right. But be careful. Yes, I know this job very well. But who taught you? I love him from my heart. And he runs from my shadow. He can give his life for Kasturi. Kajri, this is a matter of destiny. I worship my husband like God. I don't want my happiness. Day and night, I am worried.. As to somehow he should be happy. But, he is not happy. His happiness. Do you want only his happiness? - There's one solution. - What? Look, Pratap is in the fair. My husband is going to the station to bring salary. Come, let's somehow take Kasturi to the fair. All right, then? Then we'll come here and announce.. That Kasturi has refused to come. And said.. That she belongs to Pratap. And I'll stay with him. - I don't care about Mannu. - How'll this help? My husband will throw her out of the house. Pratap won't bear to see her in grief. And he will call her to him. And, malign his name. How's this possible? Do you want his happiness or malign? Happiness, but not by maligning his name. Tell me. Is name better or life? Meera, the world's there if there's life. Or else, there's nothing. You can see for yourself. That he's sulking in Kasturi's memories. And if this continues for some more days.. - Then, God forbid. - What? The Girdhari in our village.. Did you forget his son's condition? Who gave his life for Champa. Entire village went searching for him.. But he was not found. What was found.. - Was his corpse hanging from the tree. - Enough Kajri, enough. I am ready to do as you say. Somehow his life should be saved. Go then. Quickly go and get ready. And, listen. Don't be so scared. If you get scared, people will doubt you. Go. Wear nice clothes happily and come to my house. And, look. Kasturi and me, tell both of us to come to the fair. - Go. Run. - All right. If Pratap sells something in the fair.. Then you'll be fine. Then it will be difficult. If we don't get good food.. Then, what will the other's girl say? Who other's girl? There she' s coming. Mother, shall I go to the fair? Kajri and Kasturi are also going. Let them go. She'll also help Pratap. With God's grace, if the sale is good.. Then it will be difficult for him to handle work. Yes, your mother has sent me to ask about your well being. Tell her, I am fine. And I am adamant. All right, I'll leave. Your parents are really worried for you. Hey, you should have offered some refreshments to brother. He has always had good food. He'll drink jaggery juice over here.. And the whole village will taunt us. Come. Aren't you coming to the fair? Fair? Let's go. Kasturi, you also come. He is not at home. How can I go without asking him? - Then Kajri, you come. - Wow! Younger sister will stay at home and the elder goes to the fair. - How can this happen? - You're so dramatic. If you don't come.. Then, I will not go either. - You go, sister. - I would've gone. But who'll wave flags at the trains? I will. You go if you want to. Won't he say anything. Hey, fair doesn't happen everyday. Go. I'll talk to him. So brother, how're you? Why are you asking? You're sale is so good. If this continues, everything will be sold out before the fair is over. Is it? "I've brought priceless bangles." "Take the bangles. Take them." "I've brought priceless bangles." "Take the bangles. Take them." "The bangles are like silk threads." "They may not talk sweetly." "Come, bargain." "Take the bangles. Take them." "Come, bargain." "Take the bangles. Take them." - "My stuff is priceless." - "It has no match." "Tell me if you want to buy it." "Someone buy bangles." "My stuff is priceless." "It has no match." "Tell me if you want to buy it." "Someone buy bangles." "The married women wear them to entertain their husbands." "Unmarried sisters get married." "Other language of love." "My stuff is priceless." "Other language of love." "My stuff is priceless." "Take the bangles. Take them." "Black bangles in fair hands." "These black bangles are in fair hands." "These black bangles are in fair hands." "This strand of hair is dancing on someone's cheeks." "This strand of hair is dancing on someone's cheeks." "Black bangles in fair hands." "Your youth allure mind." I say, sit at the back. Have you lost something? The hand shows. Hey, Kasturi! Pratap! You too are here? Have you seen Meera and Kajri? No. I didn't. I didn't even know that you people have come to the fair. Meera didn't tell me. Let's go. Hurry up. Hey! Mannu, you're back? Hey, you are working at the gate? I had told Kasturi. Meera has take her and Kajri to the fair. - All right. - Then I'll meet brother Mohan. Good. We've searched the whole fair. They are not here. It seems they returned for the village searching for you. But Meera knew that I've set up shop here. Why didn't they come to me? Hope they didn't walk past your shop searching for me. Even I was passing by. Just that you called. Yes, this must have happened. People at home must be worried. Come, let's go back to the village. Kasturi. Do you remember those days.. When we had no worries? And we spent all the time playing. I become a sparrow of the forest and sing in the forest. Do you remember, Kasturi? Yes, I do. "I'll become a sparrow in the forest and sing in the forest." "I'll become a bird in the forest and dance along." "I'll become a sparrow in the forest and sing in the forest." "I'll become a bird in the forest and dance along." "I'll fly from branch to branch." "I won't get caught." "I'll fly from branch to branch." "I won't get caught." "You fly from branch to branch." "I'll fly on every leaf and won't let you slip away." ♪ "Will dance along." "You fly from branch to branch." "I'll fly on every leaf and won't let you slip away." ♪ "Will dance along." "I'll sing in the forest." "I become a sparrow of the forest and sing in the forest." "I'll become a bird in the forest and dance along." "I become a sparrow of the forest and sing in the forest." "Will dance along." Those were the days. Pratap, don't remind me of those days. That's not true. Not true. Kasturi will never do this. You're lying. Is it? Ask Meera. She won't lie. Yes. Kajri is right. Kasturi didn't come. You've lost your senses in your love for her. If she was true and she loved you.. Then, would she let me come near you? She is cheating you. The witch has maligned our name. All right, I'll go to the fair. And, I'll clean this stain with her blood. Darn! What have we done? If Mannu kills her? Or if Pratap? Oh God! What will happen now? Kajri, what do we do now? Meera, run. Go and call uncle Mohan and father-in-law. Darn! Yes. It's better if we forget those days. All right, brother. No one gives joys or sorrows to anyone. A person reaps what he sows. Deeds of a person don't leave him for births. Let's go. Hurry up. Mannu wants to kill. Kasturi and his life is in danger. Come on. Run, save them. What? What are you doing? God save them. Leave. Leave. Leave. Leave me. The post is here. The post is here. Didn't you hear? Move the bullock cart. The post is here. - Don't you hear? - Don't you hear? I don't know how many lives will go. I'll stop the van. Leave, what are you doing? What do I do now? I'll stop the van. Listen, Kasturi. Kasturi! She sacrificed her life to save others lives. From her life and death, she showed.. That great souls can reside in everyone. And, their sacrificed gave me more strength. Now I can die in peace. So, did you know? - That? - You want to kill me. - Yes. - Still you came? Darn! How could I doubt such a true woman? It seems.. This great soul is still saving people's lives. Yes. She saved our lives as well. "Krishna lives in the entire universe." "Krishna lives in the entire universe."
