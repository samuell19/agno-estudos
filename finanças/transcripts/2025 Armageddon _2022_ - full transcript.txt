[dramatic music playing] - [girl] Grandma. - [woman laughs] Hey, what are you hiding behind your back? Aren't you the smart one? Grandma brought you girls a present. Snakes on a Train? I thought they were on a plane. Well, it's the funny snake movie you girls wanted to see when you came to visit, with that actor who, um... eh, is in everything. - We love it. Thank you. - Aww. Oh, so welcome, my sweethearts. Ohh. So Grandma is gonna go take a nap, so enjoy. - We will. Bye. You think she forgot the reason Dad wouldn't let us see the other one is 'cause it's R-rated? [dramatic music playing] [squelching] - [screaming on video] - [growl] So what's this one rated? [growl] - [door opens] - [video stops] Is that the first-place prize winner you girls are building there? - I hope so. - Better be, because we play to win, right, Quinn? Uh-huh. That-a-girl, Maddie. Now I want the both of you to watch your fingers playing with those magnets, okay? Oh, don't worry. We're not gonna get our fingers pinched. Yeah, we're being super careful. We don't want to end up in the emergency room. - [chuckles] - Right. Okay, but your grandma's upstairs sleeping, so please keep it down in here. Don't wake her up. Okay? I'm gonna go bring her luggage upstairs. Quick. Turn it back on. [static buzzes] - [crunch] - Eww. - He's cutting into his arm. - Eww, that's so gross. Shh. Don't want to wake Grandma. - [glass breaks] - You're too young to see this. - [chain saw revving] - Quit it! I want to see what happens! [scream on video] [birds chirping] [peaceful music playing] So how does your experiment work? Okay, so see how the penny won't stick? But then... But when we turn the hanger into a conductor by magnetizing it... [apparatus hums] Ah. You built a ferromagnetic apparatus. Aren't you girls only in the fifth grade? Brilliant. Nice. First-place winners of this year's Jefferson School Science Fair, Madolyn and Quinn Ramsey. [applause] Congratulations. - Whoo! - Whoo! [laughter] [machinery grinds] [woman] Station, this is Houston. We did not copy your last. Station, I repeat, confirm thrusters. This is an actual. Station, Control computers are online. Confirming satellite relay status. Maybe it's just another software glitch. ISS installed an OPNAV assembly for Moon imagery collection. That onboard camera system should be live. Patch in. We may be able to see if the station has started shifting course. Got it. Space Track at emergency threat level. Object on course to station, critical radius. 230 kilometers and closing. Station, this is Houston. Near-Earth object on approach. I repeat, confirm thruster engageme-- [static crackling] Station, we did not copy your last. N.E.O. on approach! I have OPNAV camera system on three-second delay. It was too early to move Ramsey off the TOPO console to FDO. There's no change in the OPNAV POV. They aren't moving. CapCom, why can't they hear us? [man] We have incoming. [alarms blaring] [woman] Critical systems failure! My God. We've lost ISS. [alarms continue] [ominous music playing] OTC, This is the U.S.S. Colossus in position alpha. Awaiting COMEX. Copy that. Initiating COMEX. General quarters. General quarters. This is a drill. All hands, man your battle stations. COMEX order initiated. COMEX order initiated. Commence enemy-hunting exercises. We play to win. This can't be right. Target submarine no longer maintaining safe depth, and it's on approach. What do you mean, "on approach"? Colombian Navy understands the rules of our warfare exercises. [man, in Spanish] Mayday! We're under attack! It's a creature! Did he just say, "creature"? Scanners showing a very large... unidentified object... [scanner beeping] coming at us at 50 knots. Whatever it is, Captain, it is-- it is no Colombian Naval sub. Get a target lock, and ready missiles. All hands, this is Lieutenant Commander Webb. This is not a drill. This is not a drill. General quarters. General quarters. All hands, man your battle stations. Condition red. Inbound unidentified submerged hostile. Up and forward, starboard side. Down and aft on the port side. Approaching outer marker range. Target up, Captain. Sink it... immediately. Confirm detonation battery. [scanner beeping] Bogy incoming, starboard. All stations, open fire! Open fire! [alarm blaring] Sit report. Commander, the hull's been breached. We're going down. All hands... this is Lieutenant Commander Webb. Abandon ship without delay. Abandon ship. I want everyone accounted for. [alarms blaring] Abandon ship. I repeat, abandon ship. What is that thing? Jesus Christ, look at the size of it! Looks like a goddamn piranha fish. Get to the boats, port side. Go! Starboard is FUBAR. Move it. Captain, it's eating the goddamn ship. I said, "Move it." That's an order. [machine gun firing] Get off my ship! [ominous music playing] Yes, Mr. President. That is my understanding at this time. But NEOWISE, Mauna Kea, and CNEOS all missed this thing before it was too late. And I certainly do share your concern about the loss of further... sensitive near-space assets. I have the ISS Flight Director in my office at this moment for debrief. Yes, sir. Quinn, what the hell happened up there? How can every department that NASA tasked to find these things miss this one? Space Track was able to locate the N.E.O. with enough time to warn ISS to maneuver out of its trajectory. So why didn't it? Communication between Houston and the ISS was interrupted, but that happens on occasion. - We lost a relay satellite-- - Look... I understand it's not uncommon to lose contact with the space station, but to do so moments before the impact of a near-Earth object? Quinn, that's not a coincidence. We don't yet know what it is. NASA, ESA, CSA, they've all launched separate investigations. Does anyone have any idea where this thing originated from? I have been answering questions about this for nine hours straight at NASA HQ. If I knew anything else, I would tell you. What we do know is CNEOS confirmed... that it just... came out of nowhere. Tell me how something this large appears out of thin air. I get daily briefings from the DIA on new and emerging counter space capabilities of foreign nations, and each and every one of them pose a serious threat to the United States and its allies' interests. Space is quickly becoming the next theater of combat operations. We may have a national security matter on our hands, and I expect complete cooperation from you and everyone in your department. What, you don't think I want to know what happened up there? After all of the criticism I got for being the youngest Flight Director in history to lead Mission Control? [sighs] Sure made history, all right. Quinn, no one's blaming you for anything. [telephone rings] Ramsey. Yes, sir. What--Is everything okay? I need to clear the room, please. I'll arrange your travel back to Houston as quickly as possible. Thanks, Dad. I can get myself home. Yes, sir. Sorry. We've got to stop scheduling tastings with wedding caterers on our lunch break. My meeting with the Office of Investigation is in five minutes, and I still haven't printed out the spreadsheets. Well, at least we didn't spend an hour and a half bickering over where to eat. - Ha! That was funny. - Was good, right? I just thought of that off the top-- Not to mention accurate. Did you drop off the rent check this morning before you left? Yes. Check dropped off. Hey, I got time. I can help you prep for your IO meeting. [sighs] Fine. Knew there was a reason I decided to marry you. What's that reason again? Just so--Just so--For me. Yeah. Good. Cool. Thank you. [stapler clicks] All right. Let's look here. - [typing] - That... Hey, hon... are these the viewership data metrics for, um, Q2 on the Dbop streaming service platform? - Yeah. OI plans to review the data related to this indie film company called The Asylum. They're infamous for crappy monster movies. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. What-- What are you talking about, "crappy"? Honey, they made Sharknado. The Sharkna movies. It's money. [chuckles] I'm talking about potential statistics manipulation. - Huh. - Or does it reflect organic consumer behavior? They had 81 films on the Top 100 list on the Dbop platform this last quarter. - Really? - Mm-hmm. It's all coming from their streaming network, The Asylum Movie Channel. Oh, my gosh. I've seen all these. Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus. Great. Planet of the Sharks, classic. San Andreas Mega Quake. I cried twice. Triassic World. Sharknado movies, of course. Elvis Lives! I mean, these are great. When are you watching this stuff? Uh, usually when you-- after you go to bed, so... Maybe you're the reason for the, uh, trend. Started in the first quarter with 61 titles on the top 100 list. What? By what metric? Two minutes viewed? Ten minutes viewed? No, all the Asylum movies saw the biggest increase in millions of minutes viewed, more than any other film or TV content in the whole six-month period. No, no, this has gotta be like a-- like a marketing gimmick, right? Like a publicity stunt. I mean, you know what kind of films they make. Um, they made a sequel to Titanic. No, they made two sequels to Titanic. It's a--It's a publicity stunt. I wouldn't put it past them. Oh, I thought the same thing, but that would explain a spike in one or two films. This is different. If they're profiting off of this, then it's some get-rich-quick scam, but they are no strangers to, uh, lawsuits. Hmm. Okay, it says here an average 74% increase in repeat viewings, 60% increase in combined hours watched for Q2. I mean, either this content's more popular than ever, or it's fraudulent statistics. - Hmm. - Oh. I gotta go. They're waiting. - Okay. Bye. - Thank you. Love you. - Yeah. - Yeah. Who the heck's been watching MegaBoa and 6-Headed Shark that many times in a row? Break a leg. Why did-- I get if it's Bachelor Night. That movie was... Actually that movie was a work of art, actually. [footsteps crunching] Hey. How'd it go? Ah, about as well as you can expect. A marathon of closed-door sessions with NASA leadership to go. But I have news. - Yeah? - Yeah. JPL and the Planetary Defense Coordination Office reviewed footage from all of their ground and space-based telescopes. Now, PDCO found something we missed. There was a second object in orbit, small enough that nobody would tell, but on the same trajectory, and dropped out of sight just seconds after the asteroid was picked up by Space Track. Does that-- How big are we talking here? PDCO believes it's about 1.6 meters across, but no one would see it, because it approached on the daylight side of the Earth from the direction of the sun. So what else do they know about it? Well, PDCO says it's definitely an artificial object. Now, it was dwarfed in size by the asteroid, but it wasn't some piece of space junk or a defunct satellite that fell out of trajectory. Look, we wouldn't have even seen the thing if it hadn't come so damn close to the Earth. JPL and the PDCO are both positive that the smaller object preceded the second one, impacting com satellites in our constellation. Wait. Wait a minute. PDCO believes that the second object made impact with our satellites? Yes. Okay, that might fit the timeline for Mission Control losing contact and the asteroid making impact with ISS. Yeah. [scoffs] [steady humming] [crowd yelling] What is that? What is that? [steady humming] What is... Oh. Honey, d-did you see it? No. I just got out of my meeting. There's--There's a drone hovering over Manhattan. It's making this-- this weird noise. [steady warbling] There it is. I see it. Oh, wow. It's putting on some kind of light show. [drone humming] It's coming back. It's coming back this way! [wincing] [rumbling] [growling] Is that a... I... [growling] Aaron, honey, we gotta get out of here. - Come on. - Yeah. Okay, okay. [growling] Come on. We gotta go. I understand. We're evacuating the building right now. Sir, we need to get you to a secure location immediately. That was the director of the Secret Service. He just informed me-- The Capitol is down. Article One, Section Two designates you as the acting president. I got Marine One waiting. I need to get you to Mount Weather. Sir, we need to leave now. - Dad. - Quinn. They're moving me to a secure location. Dad. This is Jerry Ford, CapCom for my team at Mission Control. Sir. Tom, we have to go. - We have to go. - Okay. [crowd screaming] [engine thrumming] Okay. We're clear. Take off. The director of the Secret Service said that there's been sightings of UAVs on the National Mall. I saw it. W-We both did. I-It flew over Virginia Highlands Park and into Washington, D.C. I-It was cylindrical in shape, about five feet across, made an awful humming sound. And then there was some red light or beam that came out of it, projected on everyone, and then it just disappeared. We thought it was gonna kill us, and who knows? It might. I mean, Lord knows what level of radiation that thing had. How does that correlate with the intel we've gathered so far? The same. There have been similar sightings over Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Houston, London, Paris. But what the heck are they doing here? Jesus. I mean, look at that son of a bitch. [dramatic music playing] [growling] Something like those creatures down there... attacked the U.S.S. Colossus off the coast of Colombia. That's privileged information. Ship was destroyed, sunk. She's listed as missing, presumed... No. [laughs] No, no, no. She's too much of a control freak. She's not gonna die without dictating exactly how and when it happens, down-- Quinn, that's enough! I won't have you mocking her like this. I stood by hoping that the two of you would reconcile, because it wasn't my place to be involved, but if you have unresolved issues, that doesn't give you an excuse to act like this. Sir... it's time to take the oath of office. They can witness. Wait. He could do that here? Without the Chief Justice? Yeah. LBJ did it on Air Force One when JFK was assassinated. The Constitution, Article Two, does not stipulate who administers it. [sighs] I, Thomas Ramsey, do solemnly swear to faithfully execute the office of the President of the United States of America, to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States of America, so help me, God. All right. That's it. Th-That's the drone, like the one before. [dramatic music playing] Oh, my God. It took out both choppers. [rumbling] - [alarm blaring] - We've been hit! Oh, crap. That sound means we're going down. - Brace for impact. - How do you know?! Look, I've flown enough of these things to know when we're going down. Brace for impact, sir. [alarm continues] [explosion booms] ADMIRAL: Jerry didn't make it. [crashing] TOM: Quinn, don't move. Quinn, don't move. Don't move. You always did suck at hide-and-go-seek, Quinn. Madolyn? Is that you, Madolyn? That fight must have damaged both the robots. It's not responding to any more of my commands. Stupid thing just crapped out on me. [sighs] Dad, are you okay? - I'm-- - Is anything broken? I'm fine. What happened? The Navy said you were missing. I-I saw the footage! Yeah, I... - Uh... - Hey. Hey. Sorry. [clears throat] Glad you're still alive. Thanks. - Yeah. - Same. Lieutenant Commander Webb. You were 48 hours away from being declared officially dead. And I was prepared to go down with my ship, sir. I don't remember what happened. I just got thrown overboard and was picked up by a fishing trawler some nine miles out from where we sank. Ended up in Cali, Colombia, and took a short flight over to Bogota, which was soon under attack by that thing. That robot? [chuckles] Yeah. The Colombian military took it down, and, uh... I snuck in and took it. I had heard reports that D.C. was under attack, and I had seen firsthand what one of those creatures could do to my ship, so I decided I needed an upgrade. You know, those things can fly. Nearly killed myself trying. That looks like our ride. [helicopter blades thrumming] Mr. President, welcome to High Point Special Facility. I'm Special Agent Lucy Taggart of the Secret Service. I've been assigned lead of your protective detail. Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff, Nick Forster, Lieutenant Commander Madolyn Webb, and Dr. Quinn Ramsey of NASA. Mr. President. Greg Stern, Federal Protective Services. On behalf of my entire team and department, welcome. Thank you. How many citizens can we accommodate in this facility? Several thousand, sir. Very good. I want to open this site to displaced citizens from the surrounding counties. Sir, this facility-- It's a high-end military and civilian relocation center, and it's a FEMA command center, but, Nick, it doesn't mean a good goddamn if we can't provide shelter and aid to those who need it most. Now, we've got plenty of room here, right, Greg? - Yes, sir. - All right. I'm gonna turn this over to the Federal Protection Services to work out the details. Yes, sir. I'll work with Agent Taggart. We'll get it done for you, sir. Very good. I apologize, Dr. Ramsey. I can't let you in. The president's on the phone with the German chancellor. Where's the Joint Chief? [Nick sighs heavily] This has been a day of unprecedented challenges that we don't even understand fully, concerning the terrestrial and marine organisms. Now, as of an hour ago, some have been destroyed, but several are still causing catastrophic damage and, so far, thousands of casualties. We just found out 10 minutes ago, a giant snake tried to eat half a subway train in Tokyo, Japan. Sir, excuse me. A snake attacked a train? Exactly. Shut down the whole metro system. Thousands are trapped in trains and--and stations in Tokyo. [static crackling] Aaron, we can't just sit here and eavesdrop on-- on radio chatter. Honey, what do you think I'm trying to do? All right, look, we can't blindly drive around looking for a safe place. There's just-- There is no safe place. There's no safe place in New York. I mean... not while there's a giant monster out there. I-- Ohh. I mean, everything we own is in a backpack. - We need a plan, Aaron. - Okay. No, honey, don't panic. Hey, don't panic. We're gonna get through this, okay? We're gonna get through this together. You're acting like this is just another Friday night. There--There is a giant crocodile, a-and a massive shark just attacked New York, L.A., Washington. I mean, a giant snake in Japan? I can't believe these words are coming out of my mouth. Honey, don't panic. We will get through this together. We just need a plan. We're gonna figure... We're gonna... Aaron, what is it? Honey, do you have the spreadsheets on you? Yeah. How--How does that have any bearing with our situation right now? Just, uh--Just--Just-- No, this--No, no, no. This can't be right. Um... Crocosaurus, Mega Shark, MegaBoa. Oh, my God. This-- This can't possibly be real. What--What is happening? Um... Okay, um, honey, uh, just promise me you won't freak out, okay? [laughs] You're-- You're scaring me. - Okay, okay, just-- - What is happ-- All of the monsters that we're seeing are from the movies on this list. I know, I know, but they're all appearing right here, even in this order so far. And this is happening right now. [laughs] Eh, no. Y-Yes. Yes. Okay-- - No, that-- - I know you're freaking out. - You sound insane, honey. - I'm freaking out. Th-That's crazy. We have to tell somebody, okay? We have to go now. We have to tell somebody what's happening, - because this is on the list. - [laughs] Okay, okay. I know. I know it sounds nuts. - Ugh. - I know it sounds crazy, but I think this is the play, so just can--can I drive? No. No, absolutely not. Where--Where do you think we're going? Can I... No. I'm driving. All right. While our understanding of these creatures is limited, Lieutenant Commander Webb here has engaged them on two separate occasions. Lieutenant Commander. Thank you, Admiral. First thing to know is that they are vulnerable. They can be defeated. They also seem to come in two different forms, organic, which appear to be gigantic mutations and-- crocodile, an octopus, a snake, like what attacked D.C., Tokyo, and my ship in the Colombian sea. The other is synthetic, which so far, appear to be in the form of giant robots, one of which I was able to commandeer. Hold up. You piloted a giant robot? Like, for real? Yeah. When I fought the other one, yeah. So who was piloting the other one? Nobody. Seemed to be running on some sort of advanced AI system. [scoffs] Let me get this straight. We're under attack by mutant fish, wildlife, and Skynet? At the same time? Yeah. Why not just pick one? It took just one of those creatures to sink a U.S. Navy warship and kill 99 of my men and women. The organics have shown incredible aggression and strength unlike anything the military has ever faced before. The synthetics, on the other hand, I believe that they can be reprogrammed. This is Dr. Ramsey from NASA. Excuse us. I collected blood samples from the mega piranha off of Madolyn's uniform. It appears to be extraterrestrial. These things are aliens? The drone. Um, every time one of those creatures attacked, a drone was seen flying nearby. So are we to assume that those drones are extraterrestrial as well? Well, there's only one way to find out. A-A Navy chopper shot one of the drones down. I-I need to go there, and hopefully it's still intact. Quinn, I will send an extraction team instead. No, no, no. I-I need to go there. I need--I need to look at it. I need to see how it works. I need to figure it out. A-An extraction team isn't gonna know what to look for. You don't know what you're looking for. You run Mission Control. What do you know about alien tech? The extraction team will bring back whatever there is to bring back, but I've got a call in 10 minutes with the Japanese Prime Minister to reassure him that our alliances and cooperation on global security extend naturally to the possible invasion from another world. - Excuse me. - Under--Understood, sir. How would you know anything about me, Madolyn? You don't know the first thing about me or what I'm capable of. Which is just how you wanted it. Wrong. It's how you wanted it. Oh, I got the message - loud and clear. - Mm. You didn't have time for me anymore. Okay, why is that, exactly? I mean, is it because I stopped letting you dictate when we were gonna hang out, how, where? Okay. Yeah, sorry. I was just trying to have a relationship - with my only sister. - [scoffs] And one of us had to make the effort. [laughs] How? By--By making fun of everything I've ever cared about? That is really, really making an effort, Madolyn. Ah, the Fourth of July weekend. That--That's what you're talking about, right? Oh, you love to bring that up when you want to make a point. Okay, Quinn, yes, I was lashing out. I was upset. Everything with you has to be a competition. I mean, it happened even when we were younger. Who got the best grades, who was better at sports. And you know what? You never grew out of it. I'm your sister. We were supposed to be a team. You are the person I shared all my secrets with, and we would watch-- we would watch scary movies together that we were too young for. I-- Right. Best friend? Yeah, sure. You know what? I'm done. I'm done with this. It's--It's obvious that you and I have grown apart, a-and this is what it is. [ominous music playing] Wait, what did you say? I said we've grown apart. Yeah, I got that. I'm talking about when we were kids, the movies that we used to watch. That's where I remember it from. What? Remember what? The snake attack, the one in Tokyo. What are you talking about? A gigantic snake tried to eat a subway train in Tokyo. Okay, when did this happen? It was called Snakes on a Train. I know, Quinn. Thank you. The Asylum Movie Channel? Yeah, why don't you click on it? Okay. Can you--Slow down. You're going too fast. Oh, these are some interesting titles-- Aquarium of the Dead, Android Cop, Airplanes vs. Volcano. Oof. I wonder what that one's about. Guessing a plane fights a volcano. My money's on the volcano. Smart. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. That one. Uh, it's... Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus. That--That looks exactly like what attacked the National Mall. - Does it? - Yeah. Hmm. Quinn... that's what attacked my ship. Simultaneous targets progressing as expected. Humans. They are as naive as they are arrogant. And resilient. The human impulse for aggression cannot be ignored. But lacking intelligence. The Chamber of Xeli verified these chronicles depict human culture and their mythology, stories of the Earth's fantastic myths and behemoths rooted in human historical fact. - Hmm. - Look. Earth was once dominated by an empire of prehistoric beasts, which then gave the uprise to an empire of sharks, according to these human chronicles. Target next weapons package to highly populated coordinates. Targets are ready and assigned. [sighs] Maybe it's best to temper your zeal for this simple act of annihilation, or else you may be called out of stratagem by the Superior. There is nothing simple in what I'm about to inflict upon them. [earpiece warbles] [static crackles] The Superior has summoned you. [console beeping] My review of the vessel's operations records show that you have not yet commenced Ontogenesis conversions. The approved stratagem must not be diverted from. We can ill afford deviations of the stratagem at a time when victory is most critical to the preservation of our race. My Superior, the humans possess defense capabilities. They have yet to engage against us. You were not my first choice. Your reputation as a headstrong commander with a tendency towards the sadistic has made you a poor candidate for this campaign, despite your qualified war record. But the Chamber of Xeli has shown favor in you, so I shall remind you only once. The humans must be spared at all possible opportunities, or we shall not survive. Is that understood? Understood, My Superior. Commence the Ontogenesis phase on stratagem, or I shall reassign the command structure of this vessel. [crowd yelling] Well, there's no one around. It's looking shady. Maybe he's sleeping. Maybe. All right, who are you, and how'd you find your way up to my room? Uh, Field Agent Wilson. Uh, this is Farmer. We'd like to speak with you. Um, those creatures, they're similar to the ones that-- You starred in the movies. Uh, we're just hoping you can shed some light on the subject. Yeah, sure. Come on in. I know stuff. - Come on. Come on in. - O-Okay. - Okay. - Yeah. [sirens blaring outside] The things that have been attacking us, they--they're creatures from a series of movies from a film studio called The Asylum. You want to run that by me again? [sighs] All right. See this? This is what happened to the U.S.S. Colossus, all right? Get a good look. This is actual size. But now these things are here. How is that possible? We think it has something to do with the unidentified drones that have appeared at each of the incidents. So then where are the drones coming from? Who's sending them? A-A shark this big has attacked several vessels and Navy bases on the Eastern Seaboard. Navy intelligence seems to think that, uh, it's part of just being territorial, right? Everything's been focused around Virginia Beach and Norfolk. It's like it's protecting a boundary. That's only about three hours from here. I mean, maybe that's where the drones are coming from. How do we kill that? [festive music playing] [dramatic music playing] [ominous music playing] So where we're going is an honest-to-God top-secret federal facility. I kid you not. In fact, they probably won't even let us in the place. They're probably gonna tell us that there's nobody there. But you know what? Do not believe them. I was up for the part of a double agent in a Chris Nolan film. You know Chris Nolan? Good director, man. [scoffs] Good friend, too. Anyway, so you know how I like to-- I like to get into the part, you know, so, uh, I tried to break into this place. Uh, what happened? Oh, they caught me. [chuckles] But that's cool, because I used it in the audition. You know, you gotta set the stakes really high. As long as we're not driving for five hours for no reason. Not a waste of time, kids. I'm telling you. But this is the real deal. Yeah, yeah. It is a real place. They even shoot a lot of episodes of TV here. They shot the second season of Z Natio here, which is a great show by the way. Um... Yeah. You see? Boyfriend here gets it. - Um... - May I help you? We're from the FCC, and I know this is gonna sound odd, but we have information that we think might be of use, at least we hope. What kind of information? Uh, information about the Dbop streaming app for The Asylum's movie channel. You said you're from the FCC? You have any credentials to back that up? Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. Just one second. Field Agent, huh? - Yeah, New York office. - Mm-hmm. Okay, um... so this is the list of all The Asylum titles. I mean, there's been, like, a 74% increase in-- in repeat viewings and 60% increase in the combined hours viewed. - Okay, okay, hold on. Relax, okay? Sir, it's like she said. We may be able to be of some service to you in this time of national emergency. We didn't drive five hours to waste your time or ours. - Okay. - [footsteps approach] Officer Stern. - Everything okay? - Yeah. These, uh, individuals say they have some information for us. They did actually mention the movie studio by name, though. That one, Secret Service. President must be here. How do you know? Look at her right hand. See that scar? That's from a rubber bullet. They have to train with them. They get shot with them in Secret Service training. They try to shoot at the limbs, you know, so as not to cause any damage. Yeah, I got one. Same scar, yeah. Yeah, we were up for the same role, me and Clint, In the Line of Fire. [chuckles] I started training early. Yeah. They-- They went with older. That's how it is in Hollywood sometimes. TAGGART: You're that actor. Yeah, I thought I recognized you. Can I help you? I think we may be able to help you. These FCC agents have put together a-a line of clues that I think may give you an idea of what's causing all these problems that you're having. STERN: Okay. They do have active FCC I.D.s. Run it through cross-check. Corporal, run this for me. We're being attacked by monsters from movies on this list. The creatures that attacked us have been following the order on this list. There's a list? What order? Yeah, look at this list, The Asylum titles from the top down. MADOLYN: We know about their movies, but do you know about their order? These creatures and events have happened already. Okay. Asteroid-a-geddon. Remember that one? It's a--It's a big asteroid collides with the International Space Station. Okay. Uh, all right. Mega Shark Versus Crocosaurus. It's self-explanatory. Uh, two attacks, both attacks, one in New York and L.A. Washington, D.C. That's-- Megaboa. Yeah. On the news, it said one showed up in Japan. Asteroid-a-geddon. An asteroid collides with the International Space Station and its satellites. So why didn't it just hit us? I mean, you only need one asteroid to wipe out humanity. Is there any way to determine... who watches these? That might give us a clue in who's behind all this. And by the way, we still have a gigantic prehistoric shark on the loose. The way to kill a mega shark is with a mecha shark. I ought to know. I was in the movie. That's how we did it. A mecha shark? Yeah. Yeah, a mecha shark. It's a giant submarine, all equipped with special weapons, special tactics. That's how we did it. Oh, hey, guys... this next title on the list... we got a new problem. Six of them, actually. Continue on your present course headed northeast, three miles. When those creatures cross paths, they're gonna turn on each other. Yeah, and if this doesn't work, then what? That poor pig is gonna be lunch. Humans successfully lured the weapons to clash with one another. - [bangs console] - How is this possible?! The humans were too well prepared for our next weapon and our attack stratagem. They anticipated it, and they lured it and used it against us! But that is contrary to reason. It would suggest advanced knowledge of the stratagem on their part. I find that explanation unfathomable. We must engage as if the humans have gathered sufficient intelligence in our next stratagem. Come on, Quinn. Think about it. A massive asteroid strikes the ISS and sat-coms. Why go through all the trouble to attack Earth when that space rock could have just hit us, wiped us all out? Okay, but none of the NASA trajectory models had Earth anywhere near its path. I mean, that's pre- or post-ISS. What does that mean? It means that the asteroid was always aimed at ISS and the satellites. There was no other path. Yeah, but why not? Okay, PDOC said that there was a second object that was going along the same path as the asteroid. Okay, but the asteroid doesn't hit Earth, which is then under attack. Okay, why not? If the drones are connected to the attacks, I ask you again, Quinn, why didn't it just hit us? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know, Madolyn. I mean, maybe--maybe it was never meant to kill us. Uh, yeah, those creatures have already killed thousands of us. Okay, yeah, I know. And look at the rest of us. We're all in hiding. Easier to kill. Maybe we don't know the true face of our attacker yet. I mean, without that, we won't be able to establish motive or intent for these attacks. Maybe... Maybe there's a reason we're not all dead yet. I bet you five bucks you're wrong. [chuckles] [mocking] "Bet you five bucks..." No, I am not gonna bet you five bucks. God, what--Spare me. Spare me the stupid saying you used to say all the time. What was it? "Play to win." Is that--something like that. It's not stupid. That's... It's not stupid. Oh, no, it totally wasn't. You know, I used to get so mortified when you would just say it in gym class. You thought you were so cool. You were so not. Whatever, Quinn. [chuckles] Uh, did you-- did you bring that? Of course not. I haven't seen that thing in years. Thought it got thrown away when Dad moved to Washington. I would never throw that away. Give me that. This stays on my desk. When we had to evacuate, this is one of the few personal items I took with me. You know, this was--this is one of the proudest days of my life, watching you two girls develop and construct that project. You thought out all the precious details, and you worked together... not just like sisters, but more like, I don't know, best friends that loved each other. I remember that that was the ferromagnetic apparatus. Yeah, with the penny and the coat hanger. Everybody was so impressed at the complexity of the project that two little girls would choose. You know, I think it was my idea to build it first. [laughs] - Quinn. - I doubt that. Yeah, but who can really remember at this point? [knock at the door] [ominous music playing] What's going on? - Sir. - Sir... we should take you and your family to an underground bunker beyond Main Support Command. There's been a sighting of an unidentified aircraft operating at a low altitude. I suggest we take precautionary action until the UAS is confirmed and controlled. Let's go. - Sounds like a good idea to me. - Hup! Was that another one of those drones? No, that's something bigger, much bigger. Well, did the extraction team pick up the drone we shot down yet? Not as of yet. All armed personnel on the facility - are on high alert. - Hmm. Sir, with all due respect, we're gonna need something a whole lot stronger and more effective. Quinn, I want you to draft a full report of the blood analysis you conducted. We have to get that info to the intel agencies as soon as-- Quinn and Madolyn? What happened? Please, sir, remain inside the bunker. Officer Stern and I will locate them. We'll find them, sir. QUINN: We have a problem. Both of the robots were destroyed in the fight. Yeah, but we only need one to get back online. Okay. I guess-- I guess the one that wasn't bashed in the head by Marine One might be our best bet. Yeah, well, the one I was piloting just shut down on me, though, after the fight without warning, just kaput. So these really aren't built for close-quarter combat. Well, yeah, we smashed each other pretty good, but I didn't think it was enough to, like, shut down the whole rig. Huh. I wonder if the artificial synthesis that--that we found in the blood on your jacket, I wonder if the robots share the same molecular structure. What do you mean? The artificial synthesis creates a vulnerability of some sort? Yeah, I-I mean, it could trigger a breakdown at the cellular or molecular level. O-Okay, wait. What's breaking them down? Okay, guys, guys, look. I think, I mean, at this point... it's aliens. Am I right? I'm sure we all noticed those weird drones hovering above the city, right? I mean, guys, come on. Giant monsters straight out of the movies, huh, with extraterrestrial blood and unstable DNA? I mean... If I'm following you guys correctly, which I think I am, I think it's just--it's aliens. I mean, you said it yourself. Anytime these drones appear, right, one or two or more of these creatures attack, and I--Honestly, I think it would be safe to assume that, um, it's these drones that are creating these creatures. Creating them how? That's a good question. Um, I think--Think of it like a 3-D printer. Okay, same idea, but you need the correct data file, right? And without it, anything that you're printing will essentially-- will have weaknesses and, um, will fall apart. Aaron, you don't actually think aliens are watching these movies? I mean, that's the only thing that explained the insane jump in viewership, A-And it really does support your idea of, you know, artificial synthesis, right? Okay, so, uh... when someone or something, right, streams a movie, so the Dbop app sends a signal to determine... what kind of device you're watching the movie on, right? So, for instance, let's say, I don't know, you're watching something in 4K or standard def, right? The signal will stream your movie in the proper resolution. [scoffs] But if these are aliens, then they'd have, like, 16K technology by now, the highest resolution in the universe. [laughs] Yes, and you're right, honey. And let's assume that they do have that. But the Dbop app cannot broadcast in 16K, and most importantly, it won't recognize this new alien technology. So that means if the signal doesn't recognize the device, it automatically defaults to load on the poorest connection quality. We're talking about a streaming at poor-quality resolution. Let me get this straight. You're saying that the--the aliens are 3-D printing these creatures in low-resolution data from the Dbop app? Yes, the lowest resolution quality that's visible on the streaming service. And that's what's causing them to break apart? Mm-hmm. That might explain the accelerated decomposition. So... the robots are in pieces? Okay, so if-- if the decomposition happens at the same rate of speed as the blood... But I won't know for sure until I can see how those drones operate. Well, there's gotta be some way to at least get one of them back online. But it's gonna be pointless to do that unless we can figure out a way to keep the robots from--from collapsing once we get them back online. BOTH: Electromagnets. Strong enough to attract a few thousand pounds of weight and keep the robot from collapsing in on itself when it tries to stand or walk. And when it tries to fight, we'll have to account for the weight bearing, impact absorption, stress-pressure rates, punch-speed acceleration. Otherwise, it's gonna be useless in battle. - Yes, ma'am. - [chuckles] You know, I think this is the first time we've agreed on anything in 10 years. Oh, I think it's been longer than that, like 15, maybe. No, no, no, no. I think it's probably not that long. Ah, of course you would think that. Well, agree to disagree. Apparently that's what we do best. All right! Let's get to work. We shot the drone down on our way here. I'm not sure how much of it is still gonna be intact, but we need to get all the pieces we can. - Yes, ma'am. - Mm. [sighs] Dr. Ramsey. I've come to take you to the president's bunker. No, absolutely not. We're--We're on our way to find some very important tech. It's not safe out there, Doctor. Then come with us i-if that's gonna make you or my father feel better. Look, I have them. We could always use more. There's safety in numbers, right? [sighs] Fine. You know what? Tell my father you couldn't find me or--or that I refused and I left the facility. It's up to you. Lieutenant Commander Webb's already departed. Her team is en route. Last chance, Officer. Do you want to ensure my safety? We're moving. All right. Let me gear up. Madolyn... we're on our way to recover the drone. Copy that, Quinn. We're about half a mile out from the site. Be careful out there. QUINN: You do the same. You got a 20 on Quinn and Madolyn? I've been informed they both left the facility. The Lieutenant Commander's assembled a team to prepare one of the robots. Dr. Ramsey went to get the drone. I thought we were sending the extraction team for that. We called it off to fortify the defenses of this facility, but Dr. Ramsey thought differently. Operation MechaShark is in the final stages of preparation. Now, the Navy is almost done retrofitting active duty and declassified submarines. Megalodon is dead. No, my mission failed. Conventional weapons are not adequate against these things, and we have to assume there's going to be another attack. No signs of any wreckage yet. You sure we're in the right area? Yeah. I got some metal over here. I'm not sure, but it looks like it's from the chopper. No, that's-- that's from the wreckage. We're definitely in the right area. Hey, hey, get down. Get down. Get down. That's a ship. They have the drone. And they look... human. Damn it. Drone's airborne. [sighs] We're too late. All right, let's get back to the facility. On me. Quinn, I'm gonna need... Where is she? Damn it. Put a leash on that girl... Come on. [gasps] [groaning] [groaning] [tense music playing] [consoles beeping] Well, this definitely isn't one of ours. MADOLYN: That looks good, Gretchen. - You got it? - Yeah, I got it. Now, we've got to keep these electromagnets strong, keep the voltage up, drive high amounts of current through it at all times, okay? Okay. - Hey, honey. - I need this. Yeah. Hey, hey. Hey. One of-- One of those drones is back. The--The beam's a different color. All right, come on. We can't let it see us. Let's go. Oh, man. That's one of the ones Quinn was trying to retrieve. We gotta get this electromagnetic rig on this hunk of junk, or we're gonna be in big trouble. Quinn, are you there? I need you to respond. Quinn, respond. Over. - [growling] - [yelps] - [screams] - Agh! - [grunts] - [growling] [yelps] Wait, wait. Go this way! - We better get out of here. - This way! Follow me! Let's go! Get away! Come on! Come on! Go! Keep going! [groaning] They usually don't do that. This way. Go. Come on. [panting] Okay. [distant groaning] This place looks deserted. Okay. Listen. We--We have to watch out for mass coronal ejections, okay? Because I doubt the locals wanted to hit the zoo with those giant creatures wreaking havoc for 24 hours, right? [animal roar echoes] What the hell was that? - Let's keep moving. - Okay. - Damn it! They're in! - [zombies growling] Let's keep moving. Keep moving. - [yelps] - Jeez! [gasping] The animals are on the loose! Something's wrong with it. Wait. [screaming] - [screams] - Get it off, babe! - Help me. - Oh, my God! Aaron! No! No! No! No! - Oh, my God. - No! [sobbing] - He's dead. - I-- - I'm not leaving him. - We've gotta go. - We gotta go! - No! [groaning] If we don't go, we're all dead. [boots clomping] [pressurized gas hisses] [conversing in alien language] [console beeping] [tense music playing] Officer Stern, Corporal McKee. Where are the others? Private, where's Dr. Ramsey? My mistake. Uh, Dr. Ramsey's already returned. There's still no word from Madolyn or Quinn. Nothing yet, Tom. But I know Special Agent Taggart is in contact with Officer Stern and his team. [ominous music playing] [rumbling] Madolyn, do you copy? Okay, now that we've got all the batteries secured to the frame, we're gonna have to manually rewire all the components of the robot that fell apart. Okay? Madolyn, do you copy? [tense music playing] [radio beeps] QUINN: I'm on a transport ship about three miles offshore. [radio squelch] Madolyn, come in. Split up. Find the evacuees. Proceed with the Ontogenesis phase. Find their president. The humans trust him. They'll follow him. I'll alert the mother ship of the stowaway in transport. What is it, Agent? It's time to go from here. [gun fires] [panting] They're aliens, sir. We're under attack by some sort of extraterrestrial race. We encountered them when we were looking for the drone. Now they've injected something into Stern and Taggart here. It'll rip their circulatory systems from their bodies and turn them into... that. What--Wait, what do you mean? You're saying that they turned their blood into an alien creature? Why did they look like Taggart and Stern? These things can shape-shift, sir. Son, give me that gun. Oh, no. I'm not one of them. I've been bluffing the whole time. I've got them to trust me. Good, good. You did--You did good. Now give me the gun. Do it now! Yes, sir. President's the key to all this. If they can transform you into an alien, they're gonna turn everyone in the human race into one mega alien race. That's not gonna happen. Dr. Ramsey's on their transport. They've got Quinn hostage? She's trying to radio Lieutenant Colonel Webb, but no response. Quinn, can you hear me? Quinn? Dad, listen to me. We are underwater. The mother ship is in the Atlantic Ocean. [tense music playing] [speaking alien language] Quinn, can you hear me?! We need to mobilize our attack immediately, sir. I can't until I know where she is. Mr. President, if we don't act, it's gonna be too late. And your daughter is inviting us. If she's on that alien ship I can't! I can't do it, Nick! Tom, the lives of millions of people hang in the balance here. If Quinn understood that, she understood the sacrifice. Now, Naval intelligence has detected an active volcano under the surface of the ocean in that area. Let's load those mecha sharks with GOTA explosives, and we can trigger the volcano. And what good will that do? It's a failsafe. Sir, I'm waiting for your decision. Deploy. Yes, sir. We gotta get the president out of here. There's no telling how many people turned into those things. The evacuees we brought in, there's hundreds of them. They infiltrated the FPS facility. This whole place is gonna go under. Mount Weather's compromised. It's no longer safe for the POTUS to be here. - We have to get him out. - No. We can still save the evacuees. The FPS may still be stopped. Come on. [electricity crackles] [controls humming] All right, let's do this. Robot's online. So far, so good. Here goes. The Ontogenesis phase has begun. We started transforming humans into more of our own kind. They have returned from the shelter facility, where hundreds more await, including their president. You two have done well. Humans have cowered in fear from the might of our campaign. Now we begin to repopulate and return our dying species to the proud and noble race it once was. Witness Xelitian power regain our dominance in the galaxy. Quinn, I got this sucker up and running. [chuckles] It's working. What's your 20? Madolyn, is that you? Where are you now? I got the robot back online. Dad, are you okay? Where's Quinn? Sir, wait. Don't. She could be one of them by now. Don't be absurd, Private. She's my daughter. She'd die first. Sir, he's right. We can't risk it. I don't know where she is. [screams echoing] That screaming, the evacuees. We're too late. The FPS has reached the safety area. We have to try and help 'em. Sir, the transformation is hideous and quick. If we go down there, we'll suffer the same fate. We have to get you out of Mount Weather immediately. There's hundreds of evacuees. And hundreds of aliens. If they breach the perimeter, if they get out of here... they're out. Thousands, millions will be turned. There won't even be a human race anymore. We have to destroy Mount Weather. Maddie, bring that robot to Mount Weather on the double. - [screaming continues] - MAN: Help! One of the weapons is back online. What? Moving towards Mount Weather facility and all the new spawn growing within. [tense music playing] [speaking alien language] [drone humming] There's another one of those drones flying over us. I'd rather take my chances out there - than what's in here with us. - No! We can't let what's in here with us get out there, not by any means. [growling] All right, you ugly son of a bitch. Let's go. [speaking alien language] - Tom-- - I am not deserting my post. If they get me, then Madolyn can wipe them all out with her robot. [screams echoing] [controls whining] It's failing. [grunts] Whoa. Sh-- - Madolyn. Ma-- - [screams echoing] Here they come. There's no way we're gonna get home. We'll get as many as are in this clip. [gunfire] [groans] [alarms beeping] Dad! Dad, do you copy? [distant explosions booming] Dad, the robot's all messed up. Dad, do you copy? Are you there? [growling] [speaking alien language] Oh, h-hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. - I'm unarmed. - [hisses] Hey, look. Look, look, look. I'm from NASA. I'm from NASA. I'm from NASA. Hey, whoa. Hey, look. Look. Look, look. - Ho oh oh. - [breathing heavily] No, look! It's a radio. See? It's harmless. It's harmless. [winces] - See? - [teeth chattering] It's a trophy. I-I won this. I-I put it in my bag by accident, a-and I wanted to keep it safe, so... - [clicking tongue] - Yeah. - [clicking tongue] - [gasps] [clang] [wailing] [groaning] [moaning] [console beeping] [roars] No! No! No! - [clang] - [all moaning] Yes. [grunts] [alarms blaring] [console beeping] Okay. QUINN: Okay. [growling] [shrieks] Easy. Easy. There's no time. There's no time. Take cover! Take cover! Dad, take cover! That's--That's not my dad. Oh, man. They're all getting out! [tense music playing] Alien spaceship fights a tornado. I'll let you know who wins, Maddie. I love you. [energy crackling] Quinn! - Quinn. - [grunts] - Quinn, are you okay? You okay? - [coughing] [gasps] [laughs] [sighs] You, um... You owe me five bucks. - [scoffs] - [laughs] The--The asteroid, it was never meant to hit Earth. They needed us, humans, to repopulate their species. Yeah, those things, they, um... they got into the facility, and they turned everyone into... whatever. Dad? Mm-mmm. But he kept them from turning any more of us into one of them. He was a hero, and he saved our lives. [chuckles] We can't let that be in vain. He would have-- He would have already started helping rebuild the world. Do you think that we could do that as friends, instead of rivals? I know that was my idea. [chuckles] Peace. [laughs] Honestly, Quinn, I don't even know anymore. [chuckles] Okay. Fine. [together] Agree to disagree. - [laughs] - Oh, my God. [sighs] Let's get up. What are you doing fighting aliens? [sighs] - [winces] - Just-- - You okay? - Yeah. All right. [groans]
