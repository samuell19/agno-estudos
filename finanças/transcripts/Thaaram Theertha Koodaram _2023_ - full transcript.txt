(Random conversational murmur inside a police station) - Is Sir in? - Yes, he is. (Random conversational murmur inside a police station) Sir... That woman is not gone yet? No, sir. I tried my best to convince her. She has not stopped weeping. What's the use of weeping now? What about the FIR? It's being typed, Sir! Call her! Sir! (Random conversational murmur inside a police station) How many times do we have to tell you? No use standing here. If you want to see him, you can when he comes out after 14 days. Wouldn't that do? Sir, he has not done anything wrong... it was all for me... he took the money for my admission. He returned that money too. Sir, then why... I don't have anyone else. He is a good guy... it was for me... - for me... - No use crying... he will be taken from here in an hour or so. Don't come pleading for such frauds. Hey, you... Send her off... Hmm, come...

I forgot to give you Please make do with this. I hope there will not be any problem. Where did you go? I went to give him money. Money? We have to give some money when they come for such enquiries.

Okay, forget it. - Bro, how much is that? - It's twenty. That too please. Anything more? That will do. The cat did that...

Just wait there, I am on my way. Come here Come Why are you sitting there? How many times have I told you not to wander here and there? Walk quickly and don't fidget! Chikku! You wait here! Get in... My bag is not with me My bag... my bag... This is your usual way! Huh? Last week, you made a din saying your phone was missing... you got it later from your cupboard. Cupboard? Let me check again... I will call you on your phone Okay Check your room thoroughly It's ringing.. No bro, we have not ordered anything... What...? Why did you come to my room? Which room? Give me my phone, please... Which phone... The phone which you took from my room... forgot? I need to get that to go to work... Bro, there's no phone here. One thing... Ok, don't give, I will get hold of it. So you use kids for this... I will lock you. You won't give me peace of mind even to take a bath? I need to tell Prasad bro this. I know you came into the room. I will show you what I can do. You had said you would settle my payment by 11 today. So, it's not 11 yet for you, my child? You lie here on the bed and send me voice messages at intervals. Am I your guy that I will listen to it and enjoy? Settle my money at the soonest. Do you understand? Suretta, it has not been credited yet. What credit and debit? Look here, did I lend your Dad money looking at your credit and debit? I will now show you how you will want to chase me after this! If I have lent money, I know how to get that money back. Babu, come. Bye. See? Didn't I tell you, you would call me? Suretta, that phone is not mine, it belongs to the occupant next door. He's making a din. Says he will complain to the police. If the police intervenes things will move to another level... Don't get into mischief. Bro, I will settle the money tomorrow for sure. Please give the phone. He needs to go to work. Gimme my money and take the phone. Got it? Will transfer a 20k by 11 a.m. tomorrow. Will settle the rest in one week. - Chikku, go and sit there. - Yes. All set. You will get your phone by 11 tomorrow. No way. I need to work tonight. Bro, can't you take leave for just this night? Do I go to work at your convenience? I cannot work without my phone. Bro, I am not saying just like that. Listen to this. Look, I am sorry. I will do something. Will transfer a 20k by 11 a.m. tomorrow. Will settle the rest in one week. You heard it, right? Tomorrow, as soon as I get this, I will repay Surettan's amount and get your phone. Why should I bother because you borrowed money from someone? Should I suffer for what you did? Bro, you need a phone, right? Is this enough for work? No way. My number is linked with the app. Getting a new number and setting it will be troublesome. Bro please, don't create trouble. It's just a matter of a phone number. We can find a way. We can set that. Yes, we can do that. Okay, so I will see you after work. No, no, please. I am expecting a few personal calls. It's going to be trouble if I don't attend. I can take the calls for you. I will come with you bro. That will be troublesome. No, it's alright. We are okay. "Oh, night!

About what you asked, I could not arrange it. You know how hard it is for me to ask him about this. I will give the phone to Chikku. Hallo, Amma Chikku? Darling? - Have you eaten? - Yes. We went out on a jolly ride yesterday. Really? Where did you go? We went by road, far. Fast. We'll all go out together when you come? We will. Amma will take you. There's a big beach here. We'll go to Fort Kochi. To Marine Drive. There are big ships. We'll sail on those. When will you take me? First, give me a kiss. Who is that on phone? No one. Company call. Don't waste that kiss, give me. Chikku, come Come You have not given your permanent residence address, this shows the address of a lodge. I stay there temporarily. Why is that? Do you stay at this address now? No, Anjali Gardens. Where at that location? What's the house number? 56. There are only 38 houses in all. I live there. I suggest you don't let this opportunity go. They are also providing transportation here. Why think more when they give a salary of 8000? Ma'am is it possible to adjust the timing? There's no one to look after the child. They can't run a textile shop at your timings. Most of those who work there are more or less in these circumstances. There's 1500 due. You take this now. This is only 500. If you pay in such small installments, when will this get settled? - I will give. I need to restock. - Give it Take it Hold this. - Hey, sweetheart! - What happened to your phone? I cannot get through. Is it on silent? What is it...not going to school today? This came home by post. It has ATM card etc. When did you manage this? It's not that hard to get. Come in. No, bro, I have something to do. Then you leave, we will go for an outing. I will get her home. No, she has some plans. What plan? Some outing... come, let's go. Here. It's cash for your work. There's five here. You keep it, you will have your needs. Then you take this to buy chocolate. Keep it We just bought some. Never mind, you take this. Yeah, you take it from Uncle. So, bro, what's happening to your Visa? Huh.. Your visa. Are you following it up? The passport is all set. Just need money and Visa will be ready. What are you saying? Won't I give the money? I will give you that. Don't do anything else for that. Okay? Say goodbye to Uncle. Give me a kiss. Bye. Should I carry you? Just realized why she would not let me clean the place. She won't even smile. Yes What's it, son? Where are they? I cleared them out. Don't ask me. They are a headache to deal with. Some of her guys came and made a ruckus. It's some money matter. I had to chuck them all out. Sir, who is that little girl to her? She says sister, but who knows! It looks her own kid, wonder how she got it. Anyway, she had enough stuff for a full house here. Wonder when she got all that in here. Hey, there is no water. Huh? There's no water in the room. I am coming. Won't ever call the plumber! Doesn't even have a spanner here. Look, there's a letter. Is there someone called Idaya Maran staying here? Yes, he does stay here. There is a registered letter. He is not accessible on phone. I will give. He was here till now, he just went out. No range here. One should stay in locations with no range. Do one thing... Hey don't forget to hand over that, it's a job matter. I'll give it to him. Sign here. Do you have a pen? You, sign like Idaya Maran. Idayamaran? Hold that... hold... its right. Okay... I agree, what you say is right. But I have my own stand. Oh my God. Hey, have food before you go! I will eat, Mom. Oh, it's you! Chikku. Look, if it's like before, it's a no go. No one has forgotten the old issues here. I cannot manage again. Nothing like that! I have paid up all dues. My mom will not be the least interested. You try elsewhere. That will be the best. Hallo? Hallo. Who is speaking? Please connect Amma. Chikku says she wants to speak. Chikku? Hey, you are still speaking to her. Don't you have any conscience? You don't like us being happy? Your father changed her mind and took her with him, used her well and when she became ill, left her on the streets. He will not live in peace. None of you need come this way till we die. If any of you disturb us again, I will not remain a human being. You disconnect! Phone please Chikku, what happened? Sister, has Amma's phone been switched on? Phone! Amma had called yesterday night. You had already slept. You must definitely give me the phone when she calls again. I heard what's happened. I feel guilty when I think of your condition. After all, we are classmates. I have told you to call me in case you need help! Let's do one thing. Let's go for a trip for 2 days, and come back after you chill out and you are okay. Don't stay away thinking of the money you owe me. I promise you your financial issues will disappear by the time we come back. Don't think too much. Just say where you are, I will come over. Did you forget this? No, it had a complaint. It can be repaired. Do you have a different size of this? Yes, I will get it. Isn't this cute. It will be good for her. No, please. It's got music... She won't wear this. Says who? I have cried a lot for this in my childhood. Kids love this. Why spend money unnecessarily? Don't let my Mom hear this. We don't have qualms about spending for needs. I said that thinking of nothing in particular. I have caused enough problems for you. What problem? Idaya, do you know? I am going abroad in a short while. Life is settled after that. We can have this. Bro, we'll take this. Sir, this is a show piece, I will get you one from the godown. Then why are you here with your shop open? I will be quick, Sir. Where's the other guy? He's been gone awhile. I will count to ten. I need the stuff within that. Sir, one second... please wait... one minute... (Count down) Here you are, Sir! Very nice! Ten more... Huh? Need ten more. Okay. Is it her kid? No her younger sister. They are in trouble. We should help such people. Isn't that what Dad told us? Right, Mom? Yes. We should help. I told you. I didn't think that lodge manager was such a bad guy. To think he grabbed women! True. But girls living in lodges is also not a fine idea. Yeah. That's what I said. If it's a house, it won't be trouble. We can keep an eye on them. Do you have money to pay the advance? Don't belittle him. He is now an earning guy. Yeah, I forgot that. He is earning, handling a job migration to the Gulf all by himself, he is even looking after waifs. He's blessed. You wait and see, he will make success here too. Do one thing. Don't wait till it's dark. Find a good hotel and take a room. We'll think of a house in some time. You have money, don't you? Don't you? Huh? Yeah, I have money. Then make a move. Look, tell him the other thing too. Yeah. Sanju! Don't forget the registration! Huh! Where are you off to? Are you crying? Why do you cry? Look, you stop for a while and cry. You can't walk! I don't have one rupee with me! My God! Okay now? Look, things are like this here. We will have time only to cry if we start doing so. I will give back the phone in two weeks. Please do one thing. Leave us at the District Hospital and go. I will find another way. Shopping done? Yes... buying things one by one. I have only a few days to go. The passport is ready, almost. Do you need my help? No, please eat. Get up, come out. Sit here, I will be back soon. Don't go anywhere, be here. Come. Do you need water? Look, please sleep. 'INTERVAL' Chikku Chikku Chikku Get up, it's time for school. What's the time? It's 5.30. Even the sun's not up. Yeah, there's time, it's only 5.30. Get up, it's late. Stay here, I will come now. Hallo madam. Power doesn't fail usually. Okay, okay. I understand. I will attend this. Wait, wait... Let's eat. Did you brush your teeth? Sorry. You have all conveniences. These were all at home. We had fridge and washing machine too. We can still buy all that. There is space here for everything. We can keep the fridge there. And the washing machine... in that corner. When in Bombay, it was like this in the chawl. Ten fifteen people in a smaller room than this. Why were you in Bombay? I am from there. Papa adopted and brought me here. Kids in school used to tease me much. For what? Because I could not speak proper Malayalam. Now I am set! Have you eaten Pav Bhaji? No. It's great. We'll make it here one day. Let me work for two days, we'll get everything going. Can you find me a part time job? Why a part-time job? You have been offered a job. Only the written test has been cleared. There is still the physical test and the training period. Army? No, the Police. I don't think that will happen now. Why? I am not fit enough. I won't clear it if I walk in casually. I need good stamina. When is this test? This 18th. Two weeks' time left. We can make it work. You eat! How can I... sitting inside here... We'll find a way, you eat now. No, Uncle. I understand the fact.... I have sent Latha there. She should be there by now. Sir I will reach there as soon as I am free...Sure. (Random TV audio) I will be there on the previous day. It's the wedding. Uncle just tell them. Look, bro, not there, here. She doesn't live here now. I chucked her out the day you came here looking for her. Look at this register if you have a doubt. Look. What register? Take it away. - Don't you touch me? - What will you do? You take your hand away. Do you wanna see me touch you? Try touching me. - You will get it back. - You go man! I will see you when you step out of here. You.. get the hell out of here This is good to create stamina. Eat.

I will call you... - Righto.. - Okay, Bro. Where are you, you idiot? Where have you kept your phone? Are you cheating us? Wait, wait, this is not she. It's her friend. She is in some problem. She is not in town. I will ask her to call you back when she returns. You don't chatter, just hand the phone over to her. Her problem. I will solve her problem for her. Send her over here. She has good looks. I will tell her how to make money. Bro, the issue will be resolved when she pays you. Do you need to talk to her like this? I am talking about making good the money owed. I will pay you some for that. Hey, the cat got your tongue? Bro, don't trigger me this way. I am already in a frenzy nicely sweating it out. Yeah, I meant exactly that... to make you sweat it out in a frenzy. Got that? Send her over! 'But it's now on my head.' 'Do something.' 'Talk to Surettan about this.' Look, is Babu in? Bro, didn't you see all that footwear outside? If only the guy who owes money returns it can one give to the next guy... Neither is happening. That's because they were hospitalized. Not intentional, Suretta. Will pay definitely on the 12th. Okay, go, go, go... - Aha, who's this! - Suretta. Sudhi! Where have you been? Was in Bangalore for a few days. Bangalore! You went on tour to Bangalore after taking money from here? Nothing like that...Suretta, I was running round for some wedding needs... Say again! When's the wedding. The date not fixed yet, it's in discussion. - Will we need to come? - No, Suretta Don't make us come home. Pay your dues. Sure...sure... What a smile... He gets us dazzled by that, huh? Babu? Babu... What I meant by frenzy is this... Do you see? Do you see? Hey, hold him off. Hit him and chuck him out. Chuck him out. Are you okay? Dad was a carrier. He was completely depressed after Mom died. One day, he brought Chikku's mom home. Chikku was born after that. He got caught in a big case after that. The bail was expensive. We sold the house. It was not enough. We had to borrow from some people. Dad did not come to us after getting out of jail. Dad left town in fear of someone. Chikku's Mom was not able to handle the issues. She took Chikku and went back to her husband. He did not want Chikku. Doubtful today. Let me do this tomorrow? No way. Finish the work today. The occupants are complaining. Look, you won't have any power supply issues after today. I have brought the electrician. What happened? The bike skidded. Where? On the way. Saw the doc? Going for that. Tell me if you need something. Here not there. Idaya, it's the first time in my life someone asks me if I am okay. May I ride? Do you know how to? Dad has taught me a bit. "Infinite joy in the heart..." "Joy and infinite enthusiasm" I have not been able to do anything for them. After making money abroad, I want to build a house and live under one roof with them. A house here... That was Dad's dream. Things will work out. Sanju... Sanju... Okay. 'How is this? Shall I post this?' 'You are a gone case, my girl, once I post this...' 'think hard!' 'Or you give me my money.' 'Whatsapp pic shows: Online Fraud. Beware of her!' 'So think and let me hear a good decision.' 'Now this is private.' 'You just need to let me know if I should make it public.' 'It will lead to a case and ruckus. It will affect your job.' You think it. 'You are my friend, right?' [Indistinct chatters] So this is your job now? Come, sit in the car, don't get wet in the rain. Come on in. What do I do with this? I need the full amount, right now. How will you repay the amount entirely, like this? You can keep this. Give me ten days. I don't want any excuse. I will create real trouble for you. I know your FB dealings. I will alert all of them. You will get shamed like hell. Please, you know my circumstances for the last one year. How do I cope! I lent you money knowing all that. I also made you a grand offer, but you don't seem to want that. The offer still stands. You.... What's your dream? A job. House. Then, to help helpless people like me. Can you do this? I can try. Then you help them. I will protect you. If you come after Idaya hereafter.... "Tears, go far..." "From now on" "No more weight on your mind" "Come, everything will be alright" "From now on." "Life will become blessed for sure." "There's infinite joy in the heart." "Joy.... And infinite enthusiasm" (Random radio commentary) Bro, here! Where is Mom? Ajay! Mom! What happened to your face? Mom, someone has destroyed Dad's grave. You all didn't see? Oh, that happened when Ajay brought in a JCB to level the plot. Don't we need to build a house? But why should we disturb Dad for that? Shouldn't one be careful? We need to build it up, let me see if I can get someone. No need, Ajay will do it. I was going to call you. Your passport has come. You get things moving for the migration. I will give you the money for the visa after the registration, day after. Things will move faster now. The loan was delayed because the land is not in my name. If you have any purchasing to do, take money from her. You look depressed. Why? He came by the property. The grave? Someone will make it alright by the evening. Don't be depressed about that. It's Ajay's Dad's, he will take care of that. Sanjay, have you consulted anyone before? Sir, I go to Chottanikkara at times. I find some relief there. Who from there? Amma, the Goddess. Child, even if medicines are prescribed, the best treatment would be slow. After observing the patient's ups and downs. It's bipolar disorder. I suggest starting treatment right away. Sir, don't worry, I will be alright in two days. I have been scared and shut myself at home till now. You are talking about shutting me up again. She has an exam in two days. And I have things to do before that. Sanjay, you are unwell. You must understand that. Sir, just two days. I will definitely come back. '(Opening statement of sale deed of property between Sanjay and Ajay being read out)' Give me original Aadhar Card (biometric identification card issued by Govt of India) Bro, give your id proof. Give your Aadhar Card. - Did you forget it? - Yes, I did. Didn't you bring your Aadhar? Then go and get it fast. What's this? Didn't I tell you particularly to bring your Aadhar Card at the registration? I had gone to our plot today morning. It's still in shambles. Aren't you taking care of that? Dad is disturbed. What? Look, this is a busy day at the registration, don't play round. I have kept the money for your migration ready. Don't hang round here and go abroad. I am not going anywhere till that gravestone is repaired. I am not going. Why are you making me tense? Look at him! I suppose it's your day for acting strange! I am not acting strange, I have an illness. It's a fact. I saw a doctor. Now, don't lay all that story out here. Come here. Let me settle this property. Ajay, don't push me, don't push me, my arm is hurting. Get inside! What happened, Ajay? Seems he forgot his Aadhar card. I didn't forget. I tore it up. How can I, when that grave is in shambles? Excellent! You heard this? What sort of a guy is this? He is a typical fraud! Try giving him his exact share! His Aadhar will come out by itself! Now tell me, was there anything wrong in what I did to him then? If I sit here another minute, I will... Bro, Ajay... Don't you say anything at all... So you won't allow us to sell this plot... you won't allow? Don't hurt me It's our father's land... Our father? It's my father... my father's land. Why don't you accept what we give and go away? What is your problem? It's the land written in your name during adoption. Don't dare to show yourself again before my family, ever! Get out, Go... go... Go man. What about the registration? Everything is okay? Yeah... Your tablets are here. Don't forget to take them. I am leaving. OK - Bro, Haritha Nagar... - What? How do you go to Haritha Nagar? Go straight. Turn Left. It's the road on the side of the MILMA booth. You... Look... look.. I cannot do this... I cannot. Never mind...let it go. You have done nothing wrong. Nothing will happen to you. It was an accident. Don't you have me? Shouldn't we attend the test tomorrow? I cannot do this... I cannot. Someone... because of me... Look, we need to bring up Chikku well, don't we? She has only you. No one knows it's you who did it. Dress is mine. Bike is mine... You are me totally... What else can I do? As the doctor said, I have a lot of issues. I am helpless. My mind is sick. I am a total useless. Let me be useful to you at least. Please don't speak so... It's for Chikku... think of her at least...please... Please.. I cannot... I cannot... Never mind... let it go... 1093 Final try 1... 2... 'After two months' Sign here. Sign here. Sir. Okay Sir. We'll go? Bye.
