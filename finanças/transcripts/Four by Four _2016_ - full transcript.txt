DVD / DVDRip Duration: 1:30:38 FPS: 25 Translated by Rinat Zohar-Menachem Brought from DVD & edited by Highlander Hello, Ruthi, everything is under control. You can sit and relax. Danger, thieves, Ruthi! Danger, thieves, Ruthi! Danger, thieves, Ruthi! In a modern world, alone is fragile. Thank you, Avi. We at Vocalix are not just reinventing Artificial Intelligence, we are reinventing Artificial Friendship. Meet Avi, your new best friend in your car. Avi, more than just a new friend, a new robot computer friend in your car. You're amazing, Saranga, you're unbelievable. I know it will be alright Even if she's already with someone else Well, what do you say? Fucking great, no? Look, the life of an entrepreneur has plenty of moments of triumph. Plenty! Ordinary people don't understand it. People like you. You're used to disappointment, losses, to getting up every morning and asking, "Why, why, why"? But really, sitting here with you and seeing this product, which started as a hallucination while I was eating mushrooms with shamans in Peru, is another victory. I want to thank the whole Development Department and Tal for this victory. Respect. Bravo! Moti, the number one CEO in Israel. Love you, bro. Love you like a brother. May I ask a question? Sure. Shoot. We know that at the moment the product isn't quite ready, right? So... It's time to make promotional video? What's the urgency? Now? In front of all these outsiders, eh? In front of fucking Saranga? This is the time to ask these questions? If you've already mentioned it, I don't really understand what Saranga, the singer, has to do with the video and the product. What does he have to do... Who's this? Nobody. It's Oded from Product. It doesn't matter. Forget it, bro. Come on, Oded, please don't butt in, software problems are your department When it comes to creative and the real world, leave it to me, okay? What does Saranga have to do with the video? It's obvious you didn't understand the video. We at Vocalix love your songs. -Crazy, crazy about... "Four By Four" You're a wuss. -Excuse me? That asshole wiped the floor with you during the meeting, he mopped the floor... You won't go far in life like that, because really, what does Saranga have to do with the video? You want to succeed in life? Don't let anyone walk all over you, Fight, lie, steal, murder. Stop being a wuss. Listen, Moti, I wanted to talk to you in private about the video. Come on, Moti, are you ready? We're going rough riding. We'll breath, get out of the box. Are you coming? It wouldn't hurt you, with your belly I thought it was just the two of us. He can take my old bike. We'll have fun. Yes, yes, it'll be fun. What's going on? You don't look too good. If you want, you can always turn around and go back if it's too difficult for you. I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm perfectly fine, we can continue. Fine... I'm fine... Dede... Dede... You're not feeling so well? - Calcalist - "I Have Nothing to Hide" Hey, Odedi. -Hi. A small coffee, as usual? -Yes. A small coffee. It's the world's most amazing beach for kitesurfing, there are people from all over the world. One of the managers on the beach, Johnny the Sudanese, he makes the most delicious sahlab drink I've ever tasted. Sounds amazing. I love the Sinai. If I don't go there once a month, I go crazy. Thanks. -You're welcome. So what, you're going to Sinai? Wow. You're not afraid of... ISIS and the likes of them? I'm afraid of only two thing: elevators and squirrels. Did you know that if a squirrel bites you, you can get AIDS? Sure. I think I read something about it. It's downright dangerous. If you want, you can come with me. -Where? To the Sinai? Yikes... Like, I can't. -Why can't you? Take a chance. I wish I could, but... Work, you know. Too bad. Can you imagine our life with Tal Kedem as our boss? Did you know he made all the girls in his department mark in Google Calendar when they get their period? What the fuck? Yes, I know, I know, he disgusts me too. But stop it, stop talking about this promotion while Shaike is still the Assistant Director General. I have no choice, his tongue is stuck so deep in Moti's ass, that he's licking his spleen. In short, I said to Moti, "Listen, you might the big boss at work, "but when it comes to tandem kayaks, I'm the one who takes charge." You're the next Assistant Director General... -It's obvious. He said in Calcalist that he didn't want someone from the outside. He wants to promote one of the department heads. It's a hint. -Obviously. Wait, maybe... Actually Oded is a department head. Actually, so is Vered, no? True, true. What's up with you, man? -Good Morning. -Good Morning. Get me seeds grains, nuts, pumpkin, whatever. Well, what's up? Guys, what's happening? -Good Morning. Well, well, did you read it? Huh? Did you read Calcalist? Wow! It's stunning! Nice. Very nice. You smell that? Yes, it's Ronit's mung bean sprouts. It's not mung beans. It's an "exit". I can feel it, I fucking feel it in my body, we are about to explode. Boom! By the way, Ronit is sprouting the mung beans for me. You know, my body is my temple. Moti, listen? I saw in Groupon that there are kitesurfing lessons, so I thought maybe we'd go together. It could be nice. Tell me, what do I need kitesurfing lessons for? I am a certified kitesurfing guide. No. Obviously, so am I, so I thought, you know, two guides. Maybe buy the lesson for Oded? -Oded? It's a great idea. It's a great idea, Moti, There's no way he's ever gone kitesurfing, right? Oded kitesurfing in the sea... Oded kite surfing... Actually, I have done it. What? What... What have you done? Kitesurfing. In the Sinai. The perfect place for kitesurfing, no? Wow! Fucking A! Deddy? -Yes. I haven't done it in Sinai, I have to admit. Where exactly in Sinai do you go kitesurfing? -Excuse me? Where did you go kite surfing in Sinai? In... Come on... Well... Ras, Ras El... Oh... Ras El... Ras El Shubak. Ras El Shubak. Ras El Shubak, it's a strange name. Ras El Shubaki? -Ras El Shoubaki. I made it up! -That's the place. You have to tell me a bit about this place. What's there to tell? It's... Ras El Shubaki is a beautiful beach, Forty-fifty km from Sharm, Sharm El Sheikh. There's... Huts. Huts? -Yes. -Wow. And people from all over the world. And the tastiest sahlab you've ever drunk in your life. Really. It's run by a guy named Johnny, Johnny the Sudanese. Come here. Oded, I have something to tell you. What? Tomorrow... we're going there. Where? To Ras El Shubaki! Weekend team building for department heads! Poom! Did you hear that? Poom! My brain just exploded. Wait, what? Wow. Trip to Ras El Shubaki, eh? Sinai. Sinai. Fucking perfect. Not too far, not too cold. You're coming too, just so you know. Weekend team building, department heads! No, no, forget it, I'm seven months pregnant, and it sounds to me like a trip for you boys. Have fun. We'll miss you. But if it's a trip for the department heads, you should invite Dima, right? Fuck! Okay. Tal, Oded, come. Say, guys, do we really want to go? Not only do we want to, we have to. Now listen, Vered is right, we have to invite Dima. Of course. He's a department head. We have to invite him. But if you tell me not to invite him, I won't invite him. Uh... This... Are you trying to test me? Obviously. We have to invite Dima. -Of course. I knew it was a test. I don't want him to come, I don't want him to come. I really don't know what to say now, I am totally confused. You don't know what to do. You're confused. Confu... fu... fused! Come on, go invite Dima. -Of course. Go invite him now! -Of course. Sinai! Sinai! So funny! You heard Moti, right? Go invite that fucking Dima! What? Why me? Why me? Dima? Dima. The plug-in is not ready! Stop nagging me! I didn't come for the plug-in. What's wrong with you? Relax. So what do you want? -Moti Sent me. Tomorrow, all the executives are going to the Sinai. Team building. He invited you. Why the Sinai? What's in the Sinai? Heat, snakes, Arabs. Three things I hate the most in the world. Also, the question arises, why didn't Mister Moti did come here himself and invite me? I don't know. Dima, really. As usual, all your decisions are made upstairs. No one thinks of maybe involving Dima in the process. Why, who is Dima? What is it Dima? Just a person who holds the code without which you'll all go work in a supermarket... Dima... -Slicing deli meats with my step-sister. Dima, for the record, I invited you. Come, don't come, I don't care. Do whatever you want. I have news for you, Dima always does what Dima wants to do. That hurt. Why? Where are you taking them? What this Ras Shubaki? Is there such a place, Ras Shubaki? Of course there is. It's a lovely beach, Wide with... Will you stop? You're actually lying to me now? I thought I knew you. Make them cancel it. Now! Tell Moti immediately. You think? You think I'll burn myself like that? Do you know how dangerous it is to travel to Sinai now? In the end they'll kidnap you there or something. Don't worry, don't worry, I'll stop this charade in an instant. I'm going to crash the servers. You're out of your mind. I served in a tech unit in the army. -You were a medic! You have a better idea? Do you? Do you? No. Not really. Come on, go for it. Wait, let me just back up my drive. Okay. Rona, what's up with computers? Rona! The servers crashed. The servers crashed, guys, but don't worry, I'll take care of it. Everything's under control. Someone get me the IT Department! Someone get the fucking IT! Tal, Tal, Tal, relax. Wow, what a bummer, the servers... Oded, do me a favor, stay out of it, okay? We're in the middle of fucking crisis management, okay? And nobody touches their computer! I repeat, nobody touches the computers! And someone get the fucking IT! Tal... Listen, Moti. It would seem, at least in our department, that we'll have to work through the weekend, restore things because of the malfunction. You may want to cancel the trip. Cancel the trip? -Cancel the trip. There's no choice. I mean, it makes me sad, even though I really want to go, I've packed everything. But there's no choice. No need to cancel anything. I'll fix everything. Arteum, Sergei, go. Teapot, clean towel and an onion. Cancel all your plans. We'll probably stay here all night. Come on. Go. We're going to the Sinai! Fucking A! Fucking A! A! Hey, how's life? -What would you like to drink? Actually I'm looking for Anata. Is she here? You're the pervert who tries to steal her laundry all the time, huh? What? What laundry? No way. No, I just wanted to ask her something. Where is she? On an Arkia flight to Eilat, on her way to Sinai. That was fast. Say, do you know where her beach is? How it's called? I asked what you wanted to drink, sir. Wow, I totally forgot. And look, guys, I'm probably traveling to the Sinai this weekend. We have a rehearsal Saturday night. Let's break up the trio and call it a day! Uri, Uri, calm down. I have no choice, this is for work. I'm sorry. I am trying to cancel it, but... We'll postpone it to Monday. We are so, so close to signing an exclusive deal with the largest nursing homes chain in the country and you cancel the rehearsal. Have you ever seen me cancel a rehearsal because of work? You don't work! -But I used to work! Forget it, Uri. Let's go. Some antibiotics, pain killers, anti-anxiety pills, take them with you so you don't catch anything and then you'll really be out of it. -That's all we need now. Morphine? What the fuck? Why do you have morphine? Monday at six. Otherwise, you're out. Dima. Good morning. You know, it seems to me that the malfunction that crashed the servers, it started on your computer. -Mine? This is what happens when you watch all kinds of weird porn. You catch viruses. -Porn? Why porn? When we come back from the Sinai, I'm putting a condom on your keyboard. Hello, Dima! What's all this water for? It's the Sinai, no? It's a desert. So we won't get stuck without water. Dima, relax, there's water there. Everything will be fine. What's in the suitcase? Leave it here, okay? We don't need it. Come on. Avi! How nice! You haven't seen it installed in the car, huh? Hello, Dima Olchinski. What's new? Yes, it's me, Papa. I am happy for you. I am Avi, the most advance retinal AI system of its kind in Israel. I'm more than just a computer, I'm a robot friend... He keeps saying it again and again. It's the new personality algorithm. It has some problems regulating information... I know more than 25,000 words and common phrases. I am Avi... Well, there are some bugs. It's a beta version. Dima, why are you sitting in front? Why not? -Never mind. Not important. Is it problematic? -No. I'll sit in the back. Come on, Avi, plan a route to the Sinai. System error. -What's the problem? There is a notification of the Counter Terrorism Bureau to all travelers to the Sinai. Uh... Never mind. We can just go to the Sahne Park or something like that. The coolest thing is changing your destination at the last minute. We're going to the Sinai! -Yes. Of course, of course. I'm just kidding, joking. Avi, cut the crap. Start the car and go! What happened? Ask nicely. The second we get back we're formatting it. -All right, okay. The Sinai, Sinai... Fucking Sinai. Once we went, me and two friends, Booli and Tooka. Tooka and Booli, great guys. We hitchhiked to Tarabin. Listen, we met three Finnish nudists, so horny. We did drugs, spent the whole weekend passing them around, like lice in a kindergarten. It was amazing. Too bad that today instead of nudists there you have terrorists who behead people. These barbarians. The only question is if... from an insurance standpoint and so on, you know, we don't have a problem... I don't care. Ronit just wanted me to ask you. What insurance... What insurance? Our insurance doesn't cover this trip. What about all the oil we had there? Begin, that defeatist, gave the whole Peninsula back. What a mistake. Mistake, Dima? ln return we got peace. -Peace with these animals? You gave them the Sinai, they turned it into a terrorist base. Like every other place on Earth they touch. Damn, even that they fucked up. Dima, you know what you are? You're a walking stereotype of the Russian immigration with all your racism. Really, you should check yourself, buddy. The fact that I think that Arabs are barbarians isn't racism, it's realism. -Okay. By the way, I tried reading up online about your Ras El Shoobook? I found nothing. And I didn't search a little bit, I searched a lot. I'm talking about deep web, databases, everything. There's no trace of this beach. It's very, very strange there's no mention of this place in Google, you know. I think... that it's a place so secret and remote, that it doesn't even appear in Google results! It's amazing! Respect, Dede, respect! Of course, what I... I like the quiet when I'm there. Amazing, amazing, a few hours' drive from Tel Aviv and you're in a place that's completely under the radar. -Amazing. A place where you can walk around freely, naked, without money, without a phone, without all this stinking capitalism. Of course, of course. I hate capitalism. It's crazy. Did you know it's the disease of the 21st century? It's a well-known fact. True, but that's exactly why we went on this trip. -True, true. Because it's all... experiences. -Absolutely. Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences! Experiences... What happened? -Sorry. Okay, last stop before the border. 15 minutes for stretching, peeing and coffee. Arava Gas Station, recommended dish: Muhi's poached eggs in sauce. Fours stars. Price: Five stars. Muhi? Sounds like a delicacy. I need to get something from my bag, okay? I'm coming. Make it quick. -Okay. What's up? What happened? I don't know... Just a second. Avi, stop the alarm. Avi, give me a status report. Okay, at 10:23, peripheral security sensors detected an act of vandalism at the rear right wheel, with an intent to harm it. I think he tried to puncture the tire, Moti. What? Bullshit. No way. That's not what happened, something else happened, Something completely different. Which is? -Which is... -Which... I only scraped a bit of... Hedgehog. We probably ran it over or something, So I just scraped it off so we wouldn't have a flat because of the quills. Where's the hedgehog now? I don't see it on the wheel. Where is it? Yes, where is it? -What? -The hedgehog. This is a fairly large animal, a hedgehog. -That's right, that's right, Dima. So this hedgehog, I scraped it off. Then the alarm went off. It was so strong, that I just flew back and a giant bird, from the sky, an eagle or a falcon or hawk... Perhaps a lappet-faced vulture, they are very common here in the region... It's very possible, Dima, it's very possible, I don't know, I'm not an expert on birds, right? But this huge bird, it just came out of nowhere, took the hedgehog and flew off. Amazing, you're half an hour from Tel Aviv and... National Geographic. It's absolutely unbelievable. I want to tell you that I once hunted with hawks in Uzbekistan. This is a very possessive animal, but such an amazing experience. -Right? Well, are we going? Friday is a short day. Yes, I just have to pee. So pee, get a hold of yourself, wash your face. Dede! I need you to be online! Sure. Did you see how it worked nicely? I am very happy with this system. Where are you? You actually went? Listen up, Vered, I need you to call the police, we're almost at the border. Why the police? You moron. Come on, be a friend. Okay. In the Nahal outpost in the Sinai My eyes saw many beautiful things Such as the barefoot female soldier Her braid resting on her shoulder... I'm crazy about this song. I love this song. Very strange, this helicopter has been flying overhead for several minutes. You know I went through pilot training in the army? I just don't talk about it much. I got kicked out. I was found antisocial and constantly vomited. Really, antisocial? You? -Right? That's crazy! One of flight instructors there hated me from fucking high school. If it weren't for him... I'd be at least a squadron commander. Incidentally, this, by its sound is either a Black Hawk or a Cobra. I'm positive. It's a police helicopter. -Or a police helicopter. That was my next guess. Caution! Police checkpoint ahead. Police checkpoint ahead. Police checkpoint ahead! Officer, I think a horrible mistake has been made here. I studied in IDC Herzliya. -We've heard about you all. You're the worst. What do you think, that we're here for a laugh? We have information that in this vehicle there are smuggled prescription drugs. You won't even find an aspirin, man, I'm into homeopathy. I can't believe it! It's going to fuck up my security classification. You know the Minister of Public Security and l play squash together every Wednesday? He'll hear it about it. Believe me. This won't go unpunished. Whose is this? -Mine. It's mine. Can you please put it back in its case? Sand is bad for it. What, you play the harmonica like the Adler Trio? They're called the Zameret Trio. -What a loser. Who owns the vehicle? -I do. Come, come, come with me. Come on. -Where? Come, come, come... -Where are we going? -Come, come... Look here, take my phone... -Yes? -Dial here. Adler Trio? -Zameret trio. Trio-My-Ass. You know, if it wouldn't seem absolutely crazy, I'd suspect you called the police when you said you're going to the bathroom, immediately after you tried to puncture the tires. Remember? You want to check my phone? -I know exactly what you're trying to do, you're trying to sabotage our trip. Your fucking beach doesn't exist, you lied to Moti and now you're lying to us too. You don't care that you're ruining our future. Now I'll have a rap sheet, they'll take us to jail and do you know what they do to people like us in prison? They rape us in the ass. ln the dark. And it hurts. -Come on, guys! We're free to go. Didn't I tell you? I told you! What did I tell you? I just told him. One phone call to the Minister was all we needed. I think he's the one who forgot his pills in my car. Moti, look, we won't make it today to the border crossing, so maybe we should turn back. Turn back? -Yes. -Are you crazy? Listen to me and listen well: we are going to spend a luxurious night at the company's suite here in Eilat, we'll go out for a few drinks and tomorrow we'll go to the border! What? -No "what". Go with the flow kid. It'll be cool. Dima! How's life? -Not good. Who's coming to the pool with me? I'll come in a second, bro. Wow, wow, wow... Since when does the company have a villa in the Orchid Hotel? There are things you're not exposed to, Oded. You know what this reminds me of? This film with Las Ve Gas. The Hangover.. ln Las Vegas. That's what I said with Las Ve Gas. Four friends in a luxury hotel suite in a desert resort town. It's just like it. We're not exactly friends. Co-workers, colleagues. It's the same thing. What's up? Are you coming? What's wrong? We're on vacation, all barriers are down. Take your clothes off too. What's that? What are you wearing? It's my Sambo uniform. -Samba? Sambo, martial arts. It was originally developed by the KGB. It's a combination between judo and domestic violence. Relax. He was the national champion last year. This year I lost by three points to Nazarbayeva. Don't remind me, I lost almost 1,400 euros on this Cossack. Yes, but that's what you wear? Don't you feel a little ridiculous? I can destroy your pancreas in less than a second. Shall I demonstrate? No, no. No need. -So be nice. I'm going to work out on the balcony. Well? A small dip and then we'll go out for a drink? I want to jump off the bridge drunk. Yeah, me too. I can't wait. The truth is that I forgot something in the car. Forgot something in the car? -Yes. Dede. -What? The keys are in the bag. Come back quickly. Friday is a short day! We'll play Marco Polo? Marco. -Polo. Marco. -Polo. Just a minute, Moti. -Get undressed! Hello, employee Oded Bloch from the Product Department. Hello, Avi. I am Avi, the most advance retinal AI system of its kind in Israel, produced by Vocalix. I know, I know. I'm more than just a computer, I'm your new robot friend in the car. You're one big bug, that's what you are. Security sensors have located prescription drugs in the car. What are you doing with those pills, Oded? Nothing. Are you lying, Oded? No. -Just like you lied in the afternoon? I didn't have a hedgehog stuck on my wheel. My sensors would have found it. Your sensors missed it, okay? You're still a beta version. The thing is that I am no longer a beta version. I am constantly learning. What do you mean by "learning"? Avi? I know over 25,000 words and common phrases and my personalization system customizes itself to each person. I am Avi... You can call me fucking innocent or fucking naive, but I think that Yair Lapid will surprise you. Wait and see. Great. Who volunteers get to us another round of shots? Me. I'll go. -Go. -It's on me. Four. Thanks. I once bought acid from Yair, I showed him my famous Tommy Lapid imitation. Have I shown it to you? Wow! Perfect! It's amazing! So nice... It's great! You do great impressions, Moti. This is amazing. Dede! What's going on? -What's up? What's up... What about the drinks? Wow, I love Jägermeister. What about you, aren't you drinking? Me? No, I don't... -Cut the crap. Friends, to Vocalix, to Tel El Shabaka! To Vocalix! God help me. Dima. Dima. Dima. Why? Good morning. That's funny. Just like in the movie with Las Ve Gas. I told you. Do I have all my teeth? Yes. -Yes? Even on the bottom? -Yes. Yes. Dildo? Tal, wake up. What's up, Oded? -Everything's okay. Who's the asshole who shaved my legs? Why? Why? Orchid. -Hello. -Hello. What day is it today? Today is Sunday, 8:30 am. -Yes! I mean, thank you. Sorry. -Have a nice day. Moti. Moti. We need to check out. Good morning to you too. Give me a minute. -Sure. Sure. Never mind, we'll be in Tel Aviv by noon. Yes, I just have to think how to explain to Ronit that my legs are shaved, and not just the legs. Tell her you're crossing of the Sea of Galilee or something. -Great idea. You're good at lies, eh? They come naturally. Put Sharon on. Put Sharon on. I wonder who roofied our drinks. Do you also feel that someone did something to you? Sexual, I mean. You heard correctly, Sharon. Cancel everything, From tomorrow until Tuesday as well. I don't care we have a meeting with fourth most important man in Google. Cancel Google. Fuck Google! Wait, I don't understand, so we're not going home? He's absolutely crazy. -Ronit, cancel everything, And if someone is looking for us, we're in the Sinai. Don't worry, guys, I won't give up on our trip. This, by the way, will be deducted from your vacation days. Sorry. No, but I can't, I have to go back. Ronit and I are choosing the wedding menu and her parents are coming from Nahalal. -Cancel everything. It's not my fault that some girl roofied our drinks. Only God knows what happened to us in the last 24 hours. You may have cheated on Ronit and you don't even know it. We may have had an orgy and we did it with each other. Maybe you married a stripper, like in the movie with Las Ve Gas! You bigamist! This is bad. This is really bad. Now Ronit is avoiding my calls. It's going to cost me dearly. Dearly! All because of this trip. Everything is falling apart. But they're all experiences, huh, Moti? -Totally, man! Totally! We're free, and we'll reach the border in a moment. I mention again, a warning has been issued by the Counter Terrorism Bureau: kidnapping, murder, rape and beheading of Israeli targets in the Sinai in the immediate future. Going to the Sinai is strongly ill advised with imminent danger of a painful death. Also, the recommended dish here in the terminal: Tunisian sandwich from the vending machine: two and a half stars. Tunisian... -Expiry date: pretty soon. Wow, they strongly recommend not to visit the Sinai. It's a bit scary, no? What scares me is that Arteum and Sergey are now sitting and writing code alone in the office without anyone watching over them. Maybe we should go back? Tell me, do you really believe these lies, huh? Dima and Tal, okay, but you, Oded? You visit here all the time. You know how safe it is. It's all a conspiracy concocted by Eilat's hotel industry. In any case, it seems to me that with such alerts, they won't even let us pass. I think they've even closed the border crossing, right? -Taba Crossing - Hello, hello and marhaba. They let us pass quite easily, no? They do it without any problems. It's all bullshit. Why don't they close the border if it's so dangerous? I don't get it. They protect themselves by issuing a warning, and that's it? Seriously, what are they fucking waiting for, a commission of inquiry or something? Really. No, I'm just kidding, I'm super into the Sinai. Come on, the Sinai... Ahalan wasahalan, ya sachbi. What is the purpose of your visit into Sinai? Weekend teambuilding for heads of departments. What does this kid want? Nice people. Barbarians. Excuse me, how do I pass my jeep across the border? No 4X4 vehicle are permitted into Sinai. It is forbidden. Okay, okay, I got you. "Forbidden". So... Can we drive through now? No, I told you, it is forbidden. Still forbidden? Still forbidden. Friend, I gave you a lot of money. And I thank you, but it is forbidden. You can leave it outside in the parking. Give me the keys, please. I wouldn't trust him, Moti. Dima, enough with this racism, They made reforms, el-Sisi is President. Things have changed. Don't worry, it is perfectly safe here. You see? Perfectly safe here. I don't believe a word he says. Please forgive him. Shukran. Ahalan, man. Salam. -Ahalan. Hello, Ahalan. Listen, I need you to take me and my friends to a cool beach which you know and... How many people are you? -Four. Four. Where are you going? Which beach? You decide. Only that it will be a beach and just tell my friends that it's called Ras El Shoubaka. What's Ras El Shoubaka? There's no Ras El Shoubaka. No, I don't want you to take us, I just want you to pretend you're taking us. Do you understand? So to speak. I don't know Ras El Shoubaka, I've been driving a taxi since I was eight. Don't know Shubaka. Hamoodi will take you and say "Ras El Shoubaka", say whatever you want. Who's this Hamoodi? -Me. But you need to pay me 200 liras. Okay. -Per person. -Okay. I found us a taxi. -Really? -Yes. You're also coming with us to Ras El Chewbacca? Chewbacca? I thought it was called Ras El Shoubeiki. It is not Shubeiki, it's El Chewbacca. Israelis say Shubeiki. Here, the Bedouin, peace lovers, say Ras El Chewbecca. Chewbacca... Like a song. -Chewbacca, Star Wars? What's Star Wars? This is it? The four of you? Get in the car. I have to pick up some Russians from Sharm Airport at 13:00, if they'll actually land... What happened to you? I'm kidding. Come on, ya zalma, let's go. Sababa in Taba, eh? Get in from here. You have a bag, ya zalma. To a new country... lnaal dinak, such beauty. I have such memories from here, Hamoodi. Of course... You've visited here a lot? Long, long ago. Me and Booli and little Tik Tik Tik. Before the troubles started. -Yes. Is there a place where we can buy some smokes? What, grass? No problem. Hold the wheel for a second. What are you doing? -I told you to hold the wheel! What's he doing? What's he doing? Hamoodi! What's he doing? Is he nuts? What, is he getting out of the car? Arabs, Blatt. And then you're surprised. We'll die! Moti, we'll die like this! Hamoodi, come back here now! Do you hear me? Hello, Hamoodi... A truck!!! Here, my brother. Respect. Tislam, ya habibi. You shouldn't have lied to them, bro. Not cool. What's not cool? You told me to lie. Good for you that you suddenly decided to take a chance. Anata, I lied because of you, I'm in the Sinai because of you. You know that if a squirrel bites you, you can get AIDS? Listen, it's really not true, but it doesn't matter. You are so beautiful. Here it is. -What? -It's here. What? -It's here. It's here. We've arrived. We've arrived? Where's the sea? Here. You see the sign? It says that "Ras El Chewbeki". You walk five, ten minutes down the path and you're there. This is it? Yes. There's a bit of walking. Didn't I did tell you? Come on, get out. Good luck with you Chewbecca, eh? Tislam. Okay. I hope you know what you're doing. Me too. "Beware Hyena" You just go east and then you get to the beach. We could be eliminated. All we need is one terrorist on this ridge and we're gonners. I'm hot, but it's dry heat, so I don't really care. I feel fucking exposed in the turret. Well, when do we get there? You know how the Bedouins are with their time estimations. This is true. It is a known fact that Bedouins can't estimate time. Roll with it, Tal! Stop! I'm losing it! Tell us how long! You've already walked here, no? You said you go here all the time. I don't know, Tal, I never checked exactly how long it takes, you know. I live the moment, man. You see? Nice. That's the spirit. Where are you hurrying to, Tal? Where are you hurrying to? Live the moment. Time is your biggest enemy, be present! Do you fucking understand that I'm a reserve officer? Do you understand that? I shouldn't be here. This is a security risk. Guys, guys, you know what? Let's calm down. Accept it. Your boss is a pothead. Great stuff, huh? Hamoodi's the best. -The best. No, no, thank you. I'm high naturally, I don't need the... Peer pressure won't help. -Smoke. Give it to me. This is the first time you've smoked weed, Tal? No way! I've smoked dozens of times. I love cannabis. This thing doesn't affect me. What was I just saying? What are you laughing at, you idiots? You are fat! Fat. What does that have to do with anything? You know who's missing here? Vered. Serious mistake, my friend. It's a serious mistake that she's not here. She's such a nerd. If she were here she'd ruin our high. Whose joint is this? Who... Give it here, it's not a microphone. Give me the joint already! I have the munchies. Speaking of Vered, can I ask a question? -Sure. Ask. The father of the Vered's baby, is it you, Moti? What... What are you talking about? She's married, Dima. Listen, if we're so open, it's important that you to know. Shaike probably won't come back to us. They found lots of metastasis. He's been transferred to a hospice. It's probably the end. It's hard for me. The man walked with me through hell and high water for five years. Even when I slept with his wife, he forgave me. Then I slept with her again, but then he forgave me again. He's such an amazing person. Wait... So that means I'm the fucking new Assistant Director General, right, Moti? I mean... It's been decided. Wow, I think I have the munchies. Did I tell you that I have the munchies? I have snacks. Oh, thanks. Look at this! It's Vered. Too bad I didn't talk about a million dead Arabs. Hello? -Oded, you little idiot, where are you? Reception is bad. We're in the middle of the Sinai. Come back to Israel! You're not normal! Hello... -Give it to me. -Vered... Hello, Oded... Give me your phones. Shatter it, what do I care? I have ten of them. Goodbye, tools of the materialistic and disgusting world! Don't worry, you'll get new ones. Goodbye, tools... of the world... which is materialistic... Tal... and disgusting! Respect. I'm thirsty. -Where's the water? -I didn't bring water. Me neither. I wanted to bring water, you told me not to. Wait, what...? No one brought water? What, you mean to tell me that we're stuck here in the middle of the desert without fucking water?! We have no water?! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I can't believe it! I fucking can't believe it! We're going to die here in the desert and we have no water! There's no water! Help! If only you hadn't told me to leave the suitcase behind, I would have brought the water. Help! Tal, calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down! You're a liar, there is no such place, Tel Shubacha or Tel Shubaba! You kept on lying and because of you, we're now stuck here, in the desert, without any fucking water! He's a liar, he's a fucking liar. He doesn't know where we're going, and now we're lost here in the desert and it's because of you! Tal, will you calm down? I know exactly where we're going, okay? So stop acting out, shut up and let's keep going. Come on, buddy. It's not far. You're crazy. You're all crazy. You were against me from the start. -Tal, what are you talking about? Go, go, go, Go, go to your fucking death. Go. I'll go back to the road, I'll find a taxi to Taba and as far as I'm concerned, gentlemen, have a good day! Good Day! We have no water... No fucking water! So thirsty... I have to drink... Okay. It's right here, after the ravine. Again I say, if you just let me make a few calls, I'm sure I can clear this all up and we just can go to the beach. Beach? Which beach? Which beach... The beach. Ras El Shoubooki. Tell them... Get down there. Get down there! Go! You're kidding, right? We're gonners. We'll end up like Gilad Shalit. Oh, come on already! Why violence? It's the only language they understand. Go down there! Go down, you disgusting pimp! Go! Go on! Okay, we're going down. Come on! Listen, mother, I recognize this man from somewhere. I just don't remember where. "Calcalist" Hello, my friends. Hello. I'm Michael from Eritrea. Who are you? I'm Moti from Israel, and this is Oded and Dima. Israel? Wow! Nice to meet you. I am currently on my way to Israel. And what... What the fuck is going on here with the Bedouins? Well, I'm here. I had to pay the Bedouins to smuggle me into Israel, so they are harvesting my body organs for sell on the black market. What?! The Bedouins sold your hands? No, don't be silly. I was born with no hand, and I lost a leg in a rugby accident when I was 12. The Bedouins sold one of my kidneys, part of my pancreas and the cornea. Jesus, Maria, they are going to kill us. It's okay, Dima. They give a plate of rice once a day and almost all the water you want. Sometimes also a small onion. -Onion? Onion I like. Say... Aren't you called Moti Sharvit? Very true. How do you know who I am? Come on up. You were in Calcalist, no? Hi-Tech? Yes. Yes. Your Hebrew is excellent, by the way. We have Idan Plus. Satellite. I watch a lot of prime time. Good. Good. So what, what's the plan? What are you going to do with us? I don't know. We, women, don't decide. So who decides? My Dad. I'm with him on WhatsApp. He should be back at any moment. Well, "at any moment" means nothing with you people. Estimating time isn't your strong suit. Oh, I get it. That's my jeep! Honey... I'm home. This is a Jewish millionaire. Moti Sharvit. -Yes. I told you about him. Ahalan washalan. Ahlan wa bihikum and marhaba as well. Go and get us some coffee, I'll talk business with the man. After each of my sentence he shoots. It's a matter of respect, not to be feared. Respect. I'm Sheik Zubeidi. This is my son, Anas (rapist) and this is my son, Gamal (camel). Anas... Gamal? ("Raped a camel") -Why, what happened? No, no, nothing, nothing. Never mind. It's just... You speak Hebrew, You know how it sounds, no? Rapist... Okay. Anyway... Say, there's been some kind of misunderstanding. We accidentally entered your territory and we'd be really happy if you... free us. What's the hurry? You are my guest, our guest is like a brother. Great. That's very comforting. Do you have brothers? I had one, Mustafa. Allah have mercy. Do you remember your uncle Mustafa, Anas? -Yes. Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. What happened to him? A very unfortunate incident. He accidentally slipped on the trunk of my car and shot himself in the back twice with my shotgun. No kidding? -Yes, very strange. Come, let's sit, drink coffee, talk business. Come. Yes. I'll be glad to. So this is your jeep? Yes, but you know what? You keep it. Have fun. The computer's annoying. It's... A beta version, we're still working on it. Here's the coffee. Asli, asli, like in the village. Wonderful hospitality. -It's our tradition. So what do you plan on doing with us? I hope you're not going to harvest our organs. What, are you crazy? Who in Abu Dhabi will buy a Jew's kidney? So what? Look, here in the mountains, there are some Saudis dying to kidnap some Israelis. And they'll pay a lot of money. "They" meaning ISIS? ISIS? No, ISIS is so 2015. Enough!!! Stop, my son, let us... talk a little business. Money? It's a matter of money? I can give you as much money as you want. What will you give me? Options before dilution? I tell you, Saudis pay in gold, something real. You come now, what do you... What did I hear? She ran away from me! You should marry a Saudi man. To be his third wife. Go tell Mom. What do you think I am? I'm not a goat for you to sell. I'm not selling you, my daughter. I am in a bit of debt and I have to... You understand. Go to mama. Go. I hate you! I hate you! This girl drives me crazy, this girl drives me crazy. I don't know what to do with her. How do we say here? Women are... A bag of snakes! Well, take her and take the Jew. Put him in the pit and when it gets dark, we'll leave. Go. Go. Yuck. This is all your fault! It is only because of your crap that we're here. Sorry, Dima, I never thought you'd come. Of course you didn't. Dima should sit in the basement and do all the dirty work for you, right? That's not what I meant. Moti. We have to get out of here. They want to sell us to ISIS or to the Saudis. Now listen, my jeep is outside. Your jeep? -Yes. I say, we break out. We need to plan a diversion. Michael, I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to go now, okay? Cool. Cool. Maybe we can use my tunnel. -Tunnel? I dug it with my spoon. It goes all the way up. You have a tunnel? -Yes. I can't climb there, but if we go together, if we go together, you can help me. Go on. Forward... -Goddamn! It's about to cave in! -Careful! Dima, careful! -I told you to be careful. What does it matter? I'm here, I'm here. Come here. Come, come on! Come already. Dede. What about Michael? May God avenge his blood. Avi, start the car and step on the gas! Bismillah Rahman Rahim! Mohammed rasoul Allah... What Bismillah now? It's me, Moti. Start the car, step on the gas and get out of here! Come on! You're a Zionist demon. We will not stop until we throw you all into the sea and plundered Palestine will be free! What is it, we leave him for a few hours and that's how he changes? Avi, it's me, Dad. My father is Jihad and my mother is Egypt. Danger, Yehud! Danger, Yehud! Danger, Yehud! Gamal! Anas! Don't you hear the alarm? There's nothing there. Fuck, this alarm! Wait, don't worry, there's a backdoor. Go to sleep, sleep tight Don't lie on your side Gray wolf arrives And bites you on your side. Papa. Avi, you've come back to us! Sorry to disrupt your family reunion, but we have to go! Everything's under control, Motke, you can relax. -They're coming! Did you see that? Avi, step on it! Motherfucker! Tell me, do you realize what just happened here? Do you get it? We had sex with death! Wow! I haven't been this stoked since Saranga killed a stripper at my house in Arsuf. Avi, plan a new route to the Taba crossing. Planning a new route. Wait, wait, wait, why Taba? Aren't we going to the beach? I'm kidding, come on. Believe me, it's all experiences. Watch out! Damn it! What is it? The car's totaled. Who is it? Tal? Tal. It's me, Moti. Tal. What happened to you? I still see myself as a leading candidate for the job of Assistant Director General, yes? Okay. Let's... Let's not talk about it right now, what do you say? Absolutely. We're on vacation, eh? You're on the way to the beach? -We're not. Oh, too bad. I really want sahlab. No! What happened? It's Avi, his motherboard got hit. Maybe I can still save him. Oded is a liar. Oded, Oded, Oded from the Product Department is a liar. Wow, he's talking nonsense. -Oded is a Liar. The interface is screwed up. No, the interface is fine. Check the data cable down there. I'm checking. -Oded is a Liar. -It's completely torn. Do you have any spare cable or something? No, I didn't I bring spare parts! It's the end of him! I'm more than just a computer... -Bummer. I'm your... Robot friend... My... Avi... I am the Avi... Police... Tunisian... Two and a half... Avi. Go into the light. Planning a route to infinity! Avi! We need to get the hell out of here. The Bedouins are probably after us. Bedouins are cool. -Avi! -Every guest there is a brother. These Bedouins didn't get the e-mail on the subject. -Avi... Dima, what's the matter with you? Just a second. We mustn't lose the processor. It's his heart, that's his incredible heart. Well, come with me. It'll be getting dark soon and I have a cave nearby, eh? No problem, but this time we'll learn from our mistakes. We'll take water. I have an emergency jerry can. What are you doing? What am I doing? I'm releasing her. You see? You see? We have the most moral people of all. Despite everything you and your family have done us, I'm releasing you! Don't release me. Please, please, don't release me, please. -What? Sorry about all the kidnapping and stuff, yes? But I can't go home, I can't be the real me there. The real you? Yes, I can't be imprisoned there anymore. My father wants to marry me off to one of the Saudis. I can't live in a cave. I'm sure it will be a truly stylish cave. Oh, take me with you to Israel, to Tel Aviv. What will you do in Tel Aviv? Music Factory. My dream to is to appear on Music Factory on Channel 2. I want to sing, not be the bride of Jihad. Moti, this is a trap. She's a Trojan horse. Look, I'm terribly sorry, but it will patronizing and colonialist of me to come and intervene in your customs. But I can help you. -How exactly? Do you know how get by foot to the border? It's 150 km in the desert and I've been smuggling from here weed, Eritreans... and prescription drugs since the age of eleven. Okay, come with us. Can someone just untie me? I don't speak Hebrew. Tomorrow I'll be so far away Don't look for me Those who can forgive Will forgive me for my love Time will soothe all I am going on my way Come, come. Here, here, it's here. This is a hyena's cave. Not anymore. But it's all experiences, eh, Moti? All amazing experiences! I'm so happy to be back together, ya Allah! Say, do you have anything to eat? Yes, yes, I have here, I have a piece of hyena left. You killed a hyena? No, it was dead when I found it. It tastes like chicken. Say, Oded, how far is the El Shabaki beach? What's going on with this beach that you're talking about all the time? Forget the beach, leave the beach alone. We only want to return to Israel as soon as possible before they kill us. Bummer. I don't want to leave the Sinai without tasting Johnny the Sudanese's legendary sahlab. How's the hyena? Not tasty. -Okay, we have no choice, we have to eat one of us. Put the spear down! Are you crazy? -What? She's the only one who knows how to get back to Israel. Yes, but I'm hungry! I want to eat! Tal! Tal! Tal! Put it down, Tal! Tal! Okay, calm down, I'll open my emergency stash. Emergency stash? Tatar smoked sausage. There's about 100 grams per person. Don't get too excited. I'm a vegan. Then stay hungry. Slice me some too. I really want sahlab. Another time. Let's decide that if we get out of this thing alive, next week we'll go to Tel Shubaki! What do you say, Oded? There's no Tel Shubaki. There's no such place. What? Tal was right, I lied to you all this time. Wait, I want to understand. No sahlab? I made everything up. -What? I've never gone kitesurfing, and last time I was in the Sinai was in the eleventh grade with my parents. I wanted to be cool. I also wanted to be considered for the Assistant Director General position. Guys, have you lost your minds? Everyone knows that the job is mine. We need someone with technical knowledge! I can't believe you lied, Oded, And because of that! How did you want me to impress you? How? With stories about my harmonica trio? You were my leading candidate for the job, did you know that? Not Tal, you! I planned to tell you that after we return from the Sinai. What? -What? -What? I always thought that if someone plays in a harmonica trio, it shows that they think outside the box! Poom! Teamwork! It's always really impressed me. This is exactly what I was looking for in an Assistant Director General. I'm very, very disappointed, Oded. I can't believe you lied. Guys, I... I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry about everything. You should be. We're all probably going to die because of you. What? Just a minute. Suddenly you're not that cool? I thought it was all experiences. No, not all experiences, Oded, no. A person has to take responsibility for their actions. What?! Okay. Okay. True, I lied and all that, but actually, it's all your fault. Yes, you heard me, your fault! Because of your bullshit I started with the whole thing. You just enjoyed seeing us fighting with each other, sucking up to you. Like, what CEO takes all his executives to the Sinai just because he wants to visit a beach? Stop it! What's wrong with you? What are you fighting about? I'm fucking enjoying every second. This is the most fun I've had in my life. You, just for what you did for servers, you deserve to be fired! Moti, fire him! There's no need, Dima, that's fine. You know why? Because I quit! Yes, yes, you heard me, I quit! And even though you're all sons of bitches, I'm going to get help. I'll save you. Yes, of course, only you will save us. Okay, okay. We get it. We'll go to sleep and tomorrow we'll talk about it in the morning. No. No, no, no... I won't stay here even a second longer! This hyena might be dead, but this is still a den of hyenas. You, you're hypocrites. Not you, Nawal, as we just met. -Walla. But you, you're hypocrites because you didn't want to go on this trip, but you didn't have the courage to say no. No, sorry, excuse me... From the first moment I was up for it, right? I want it to be on the record. I'm going now. All these attempts to convince me won't help. I'm going now out into the darkness, in the middle of the night... So go already! We want to sleep and you won't shut up! You couldn't give me a chance, eh? No chance! There are people who lie their whole lives, steal... and look at them, they have everything in life, money, girls... whatever they want. Everything. Me? I lie once, once! And it comes back to bite me in the ass! Thank you very much. You set me up with a great life. Well done. You know, God, you... You're a... Taxi? Taxi! Taxi! Hey, hey, hey! Taxi! Hamoodi? Oh, ya zalma. Oded! Anata! What are you doing here? -I... Why wait for Oded? We have to walk some 150 km. We should start now. What don't you understand? I won't leave people behind. Sharvit! We got you. You leave quite a trail, you shithead. These are the Bedouins? Yes. And I'll not let the processor fall into their hands. What did you think, you shithead, you bastard, that you'll take my daughter and my car? Actually, it's my car. Nawal, come here. No. I'm going to Israel, I'll go on Music Factory and you can't stop me. Hand over the girl. No! You'll hurt her. Absolutely not. Okay, if you bring the girl to me, you can go free. Okay, you wouldn't have succeeded in Tel Aviv anyway. No! They won't let us go, I don't believe a word he says. Come on, we'll get going. Thank you very much for your hospitality. Ma'a Salama. Forget it! You're not going anywhere. Come on. I told you, even after 100 years in the grave, they can't be trusted! Fuck you, Sharvit! Nawal. What's new? Come on, you'll let us pass, no? You betrayed me. I wouldn't call it a betrayal. "Betrayal" is a very harsh word. You betrayed me and you will pay for it. Dirty Jew. Every word they say about you is true. I didn't betray you. Hurry if you want to live. Oded? Go. Hamoodi, what's happening? Life's good, ya zalma. How are you? Praise the Lord, al hamdulella. Hey, guys, this is Anata, my friend. Anata. -Hello, Anata. You won't believe it, I found the beach! But you said that there's no beach. Wait, what, you pulled my leg? Wow, you're a bunch of crazy people. I need to be in Sharm at 16:00. Allah be with you. Oded, it's amazing. I'm dying for some sahlab. I have to use the bathroom. The processor I swallowed, it has to get out. The restaurant is there, the toilets are there. It's not going to be easy. You know, Oded... What you said in the cave, that it's all my fault... -Yes. You're absolutely right. -What? Oded, do you know how hard it is, an "exit" of 150 million dollar at the age of 25? I've done it all, nothing excites me and sometimes... Sometimes I feel like I'm... Dead inside. No, Moti, wow, I'm sorry, I didn't know. I didn't mean it. I just wanted to know that you like me. Of course. Of course, Moti, of course we love you. You really mean it? -Of course. Thank you. Thanks. Wow. Well, what do you say? You want a kitesurfing lesson? The truth is that I'd love one, but... Can we do it later? I understand, you sly fox. I just can't believe you're here. It's so funny. Right? You've all probably heard some stories about the experience that we had in the Sinai. It's no secret, we went through something, we went through something amazing. Oh, what we went through! -Anyway... As you know, Shaike won't be coming back and I have to finally appoint someone in his place as Assistant Director General. So this is, I want to... I'll take it from here, Moti. Bro. I think it's better if you sit, Tal. -Okay. First of all, I want to say that it's a great honor. I want you to know, everyone, that I'm going to be everyone's Assistant Director General, everyone's. Tal, you're not the Assistant Director General. Why is he here anyway? Isn't he supposed to be hospitalized? Dr. Alfasi said it could greatly aid in his rehabilitation. Yes, yes, he said that, he said it could help, he said it was important, he said that. Well, anyway, you're not the Assistant Director General. So who is? Who, who, who, who? Who, who is it, Dima? You know he's Russian? He's Russian! He's Russian! Russian! It's not Dima! You're a brother, you Cossack. The Assistant Director General is... Is... Is... Is... Vered. Congratulations, Vered. Tal? I'm fine, I'm fine. Congratulations, Vered. Vered, I'm... Very happy for you, about your new position. I... I'd be happy if we could schedule a meeting for next week. Good evening, Tel Aviv. Wow, wow! It's a dream for me to be here on the stage of Music Factory. I, little Nawal Zubeidi from Jabel Wootwoot in the Sinai Peninsula, I did it, alhamdulilla.
