As forests werewolves do not have silver bullets? Look, now is not a good time. I'll call you back. Come on, Sinclair. I need your help. It's an emergency. You know this is not my field, you know that. Are ghosts, goblins ... You have to improvise it. Improvise? If werewolves had to take down your door what would you do? No silver can not ... The UV rays can make them slower. The daylight. They need daylight. They have to improvise. - What did he say? - Anything. - We need daylight. - Daylight? But lacking hours to days! I know. Think, think, think ... Think? That's even worse. Both need daylight. This is not daylight. - What the hell? - It is called solar bed. I do not know if this affects you as human.

Go around back, entering through a window and smashes them to pieces! Would you arrebentem tomatoes again? It's what you want? We know where they are. Are all strippers. As you know? High heels. How many strippers use them? It is part of their uniform. This is going well. What's it? They are strippers. Believe me. I know because I had a club in Baserville. A guy who works there had the Vixens. Let's go there. I do not believe. And if not we catch those two let's get girlfriends them. Now, now, now ... Harry. It brings back memories, not back? Well if you're here Jeannette should be here too, because I saw them for the last time in 1984 ... - Remember? - Remember Betsy?

She had a beautiful legs. - They found another? - Yes it is here. You can join to my pack. It could be ... What? A Beta and Alpha you? Is that what you want, Jack? Or you want to move away and let me run the show? Since it is an Alfa there is no turning back. You're going to see. Industrial you think. Well, kings fall, my friend ... empires crumble. Your time will come. What does that say about werewolf blood fall on you? Nothing. A werewolf has to bite you to you through the curse ... or you can bite it to him. He says in the book ... The only way to kill a werewolf is going through your heart with silver. And an accident? Or a tool? Or blow them up at once. We could get explosives ... Not! You will not blow up my club. Jeanette know she's alive? No. She's dead. It burned in my club. No, not dead. She's still alive. She's here! In London. This club is mine! And they can kill me if you think I'm going to leave a furry take it to me! I used to work at the Silver Dollar in Basilton. - Never heard of him. - Of course. It no longer exists. The place was infested with werewolves. So I, Harry and explodimo it fine. But the wolf Alfa should have survived. Because they have this thing back to form and regroup. It is what it says in the book. And if we cling pieces and we put in jars different not to re-join? No. We will continue with the plan we put her silver piercings. Or we can run. To run away! It's the best idea I've heard today. They will follow you. Franklin found and will meet thee. They can not live like life. They fear the night. You can not give up. Not now that we found. You know what? This time we will face them! Kill the last. This time we will give them the silver deaths! And undertakes to see ... While we massacre your friends and your family. And if she close her eyes cut her eyelids ... and forces her to see your world to rid ... Brick by brick. This time we will ensure that they are fleeing from us ... with their tails between their hairy legs! When she begs you to kill when her soul give ... and she did not endure more ... arrancas your black heart and compel her to eat it. Total destruction, Jackie ... Let's free the revenge Wolves! Girls, then? We face the dogs and give them what they deserve? My friend, one more thing ... Send get a guard. I feel a little hungry .... Not yet. It's still not the right time.

I'll call you later. Listen, I'm not you avoid. I miss you and I want to talk to you ... But I think we have to ... Do I have to call you back, okay? Sinclair, if explode a werewolf if you put the pieces in jars prevent it from forming again? Yes, this would work. Raven, this would work! Sinclair, you're sure you know what I'm talking about? You told me you caught a ghost with a mirror and then all these people were killed and had to deal with the calls with the process of the court and everything. Forgets. It's too late now. And also... I'm talking about the real thing as you imaginary monsters searches ... so I do not believe anything you're doing ... Call me when you have time. I did not even impressed her. I'm not going to bite? Honey, I'll call you. I just have to ... One minute. A little help? Someone? This does not look good. Scott... You know, when you bit the other day ... I think I passed you something. You think transmitiste me something? As a canine disease? Sim... I can be a sick bitch. But do not worry. I'm a dancer. And a stripper. - What club? - I was gonna tell you but ... In that club? No Vixens. Good... The pen that you lost ... It was silver, was not it? Sim. That's what I was trying to tell you. There was a kind ... O Mackay. His name was Mackay! It's never too late for a real estate. Or you can bite it to him. Silver bullet. We seem to have here a Mexican tie. Not really. I have a gun and you have a knife. Nothing Mexican. I'll kill you if you you move, killer motherfucker! You will not shoot me, Lucy. Get out... It's ok. We see you sooner. In memory of our brother Mackay ... we'll show you what happens when you mess with the werewolves. Tonight... we kill, we destroy ... and eat everything you wear braces and high heels! - Yes! - Yes! Very well... Let's kill some strippers! Sim! Sorry love. - You work here? - Yes. But I am no longer a dancer. I'm magic. So ... Show us a trick. - What's your name, love? - Carrie. I have their own magic trick. I can make your pretty head suddenly disappear. Good evening, gentlemen. This is my club. And be governed by my rules. The minimum is three drinks. Any dancer is paid in cash, in advance. Touch the girls ... It will not be tolerated. We all know why they are here. Let's try to be civilized. You want to see some hair? Shoulders down, elbows in ... punches with the waist! For who do you think was this, toothy? Barker! As columns! Do you remember the small club of hairy guys. Jack? It's my club now, Jeanette. You're head of hairy guys now? Rather wolf Alpha. Bad dog. Honey, you're dead ... You're so dead! I'm curious.

I bet you do. You were no silver bullets, Jeanette? This is very bad. You're dying, Jeanette. It is because to work in a smoking environment. - This sometimes happens. - I could kill you, you know? Just ... A little nibble. - It was enough. - You'd do that? Certainly not. There is no silver bullets! I think you and your friends over, Jeanette. It is better to give up now. - I'm not afraid of you, Jack. - But you should have. Lucy, dear ... If I have to die ... Die the way I lived ... on my own terms. Then these are your friends. Well, they are left only four. Dressed so are all good to eat. I thought you were special ... my prince charming who bought me the ring I always dreamed Do not. I love you. It need not be so. I'm a good guy. So you do not have nothing to worry about, do you? - Lucy? - Call me Justice! A blood diamond. So was it white gold. Look, girls. Jeanette is still with us. We picked up the dogs. A step further and are fried dogs. Force. As it happens with the diamond. Just regroup me again. Dear... Unless someone prevent the small pieces to assemble. And those rays would do this? Why not say something cool? It's time to say something cool. It should say: "It's show time." It's time for show! I think I can do this. Maybe I should come back later. Light... My God! It was the most incredible thing I've ever seen! My God ... Anyone else ... You should have seen it! It has just been revoked! No one prepared me for this. ...I need to prepare. Shit, shit ... I hope this works. You have my heart and now I have yours. Welcome back. I missed you. Where's Brandi? Why is not regrouped Brandi? She must have been without blood before exploding bomb. No blood, no curse. Lament. Maybe she's the best. What will we do now? I say what they will do. There are worse things in the world of the werewolves. The Dagenham vampire for example. Girls, you know that almost invincible now? The world needs someone like you. If you agree, I think I have a plan. And this may be the beginning of something wonderful. You are so mischievous, you know that? The films do not have to be pornographic to be fun. What? No. Trash, Trash good. You're starting to annoy me now. Who the hell are you? Werewolves with a mission to destroy evil. Are the werewolves that protect the innocent. These are Heroinas werewolves. Shit...
