- Hey sailor, look what I found in the galley. - Oh wow. - Thanks. - So, what do you think, you like her? - She's beautiful, a little cramped below. - Well, they're all a little cozy but I'm kinda looking forward to that. - I hope you're still saying that after a year at sea. - To you. - To us. - This salt air is making me hungry, how about you captain? - Starved. - Well where shall we go to dinner? - Well, it's your birthday, you choose. - How about De Brosa, it's still early. - I don't know I'm not sure I'm dressed for it. You really wanna go downtown? - All right, let's just go over to the Yacht Club. - That's a good idea. - I can't believe it. - What? - You almost let me pick the restaurant. - I always do. - No you don't, you pretend you do but you don't. - When, when did I ever do that? - When did you not? - Sunny, you're right, can't fool you. - It's about time you figured that out. - Surprise! - Can't fool you? - Oh I'll get you for this. - I surely hope so. - What a nice surprise. We weren't suppose to have a party. Listen, listen, listen, I'm not 50, I'm 49.95. Ann, that's hysterical. - Well good 'cause I got one just like it but mine says I'm not 50. I'm just kidding. - Oh I am appalled. - Oh, no actually how do you look so great? - Genetics, my side of the family. - Oh you're so modest. - Thanks Dad. - A toast, to the world's most incredible mother, happy birthday. Ah. - And my offering, a raspberry truffle surprise. - Brody, I shouldn't even smell it. - Oh come on honey. - Did you make it? - Yes I did. - Just take a look. - Mick put me up to it. - Africa, safari. - Can't fool you. - Oh it's what I always wanted. Oh thank you. - Happy birthday honey. - We've been dying to tell you for months, it'll be the longest double date we've ever had. - You're going too? - We've already packed our bags. - Hey can you guys watch your grandson for a couple of hours tomorrow? - Oh we're taking a boat in the morning, afternoon? - Sure. - Great thanks. - See you later. - Okay. - Happy birthday. - Thank you honey. - Drive carefully. - Hey Mick, I almost forgot, the master list for the college reunion, which you are organizing, remember? - No. - You agreed last time. - That was ages ago. - Ah, don't worry about it, you've got almost a year to get it done. - Your timing stinks Brody. - Yeah, I know that's how you wound up with the girl. - Needless. - Goodnight Brody. - Turkey. So, did you have a happy birthday? - Oh. - I wouldn't change a thing about our life. - And it's only the beginning. You know what they say life begins at 49.95. Really and what do you think is in store for us. - Well, after Africa, we sell the house, we sell the business and we go on the most exclusive cruise in the world, just the two of us. Down the coast, through the Panama Canal, up the eastern seaboard and then the tricky part, navigating the Atlantic. All the stuff we talked about since we were kids. - "National Geographic". - Yep, under the covers with the flashlight. - You sure it wasn't "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea?" God I hope not. - You know what maybe we should just lease the house, so we'd have a place to come back to, just in case. - In case of what? - I don't know, just in case we don't like it. - What's not to like. Hey wanna see what else I can do under the cover? - You need a flashlight? - Not this time. - Oh. - The hull's cord, made to withstand 20 foot seas, halyards and winches are all good. I got two of everything on board and all the system manuals. And if you decide to buy her, I'm gonna pull a her out again and scrape the keel. Wanna take her? - Honey, want to? - I hear you're going around the world. - Yeah, that's the plan next year. - Yeah, it's our dream. We've been sailing off and on for about 20 years, mostly day trips, couple of times to Victoria. - Well, she'll get you to wherever you wanna go. - Mick. - Sunny? Honey, are you okay, come on. - Oh that was embarrassing, I never get sea sick. - You all right now? - Yeah. - What do you think? - It's getting more real. - So? - Maybe we could lease it. - Lease it? - With an option to buy. That way we can find out if we really wanna, if this is really the boat for us. - Sunny, we're not leasing the boat and we're not leasing the house. Now are you with me on this or what? - Of course I'm with you. - Let's get you home. - Faster, Grandpa, faster. - Faster, whew, I think this horsey's ready to be put out to pasture you rotten kid. You're getting to be too big. - I'm only six. - Don't you let him call you a rotten kid. - Grandma said to not call me a rotten kid. - Wanna see a movie tonight? - Can I go? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, two, two. - No dysfunctional families, I can get that at home. - I love dysfunctional families. - Who says you're going? - Can I? - You have school tomorrow. - I can skip it. - Ben! Hey look what I got. - What do you feed that kid, coffee beans? - Was he okay? - He was great. I'm a little disappointed, I thought you'd be gone longer. - Oh well we split things up, I did the shopping while Dan went to the office. - The office, on Sunday? - Yeah, I got something to show you, you got some time tomorrow? - Sure, catch me first thing in the morning. No, no, I'm gonna be out of the office, after lunch, no, that won't work either. Look, just talk to Vicki and get it on the calendar. - Come on Dad, try and get it. - Come on we gotta go get the groceries in. We'll play later. - Thanks again Mom. - We'll see you. - Bye Grandma maybe next time we can go to the movies, okay? - Okay. - So when you get back I'll take a number. - You're that busy? - Oh don't start. - Did you see his face? He just wants to show you something. - Are we going to the movies or what? - You didn't tell him about selling the company, did you? - I'm waiting for the right moment. - Waiting or avoiding? - I'll handle it, I don't wanna scare the kid, now come on, let's go to the movies. - Sunny, you have got to call Dr. Simmons today. - It's just a bug, everybody's got it. - Well, this damn bug has gone on for too long. Now promise me you'll call him okay? - I will if you will. - Will what? - Talk to Dan. - Okay. - What are you gonna say? - Just that we've thought this through, it's part of our long range plans and not to worry whoever buys, I'll make sure he always has a job there, you happy now? - Yeah. - Feel better okay? - I already do. - And by the way I'll be late for dinner, I'm playing tennis with Bill. - How long can you guys be at sea without pulling into a port. - As long as we want, within reason. - Sounds like heaven. - Just between you and me, sometimes I wander what we'll do all day. I mean, after we have our coffee and raise the sails, we won't even have a newspaper. - Books, you love to read, take up knitting. - I could do that. Look I have to run over to the doctor at lunchtime, can you stay in? - Sure, everything okay? - I think so. - You never get sick. - I'm not sick, I think it's a little virus. I promised Mick I'd have it checked out. Don't worry I'll be back by the time you've finished 30 more of these. Thanks. - Danny, oh there you are, I was looking for you. I've got a few minutes thought maybe we could get a cup of... What's that? It's a new thruster design, it's what I wanted to show you. She got 25% more horizontal force, uses a third less power. - You come up with that? - Yeah. - It's interesting but I thought you were working on the Navy rig. - I'm handling it. - Geez, Dan, we've 50 joint seals to test and fit before the design review. - Well I'll make the deadline Dad. - Look Danny, I'm trusting you with our biggest account. You can't be spending your time on something we don't even know would work for us. - Mick, they told me out front you'd be out here. - Oh glad you could make it. - I'm Dan Anderson. - Russ Stanton. - What do you say I show you around. - Great. - I want you to go over and see Dr. Carlisle, let her have a look. - My gynecologist. - Yeah. - In fact I'm gonna call her see if she could see you right away. - I've had my pap test, I'm up to date on everything. - Humor me Sunny. - You don't think it's anything serious? - No. - I used to ditch grad school to go diving. I got fascinated with rebreathers and personal submersibles. Now this is our tooling and retrofit operation here. Eventually my advisor told me I was gonna be booted out of the engineering program if I didn't stop fooling around and turn in my thesis. Electrical is in there, this section over here is where we do RND. Hi Wendy. - Hi. - Wendy's coming out of accounting. So anyone now I had one month left and I haven't even started. So, really desperation led me to this guy. - Your first submersible prototype. - Yep which led me to this and finally to these. Now these big boys can go to down to 2500 feet. - Very impressive, if you don't mind me asking, why do you wanna sell? Oh it's time, believe me I've earned it, my wife too, I'm surprised she didn't sue this place for alienation of affection years ago. - The guy I met outside, Dan, he's your son? - Yeah, he works in the design section, smart kid. I always hoped that he'd take over the business one day but he's still young, working on his priorities, if you know what I mean. By the way, I want it written into any agreement that Danny has a job here as long as he wants it. - Sure. - So, what's the next step? - We do a discreet search, we narrow it down, we numbers crunch. Then you meet qualified prospects face to face. - All right. - So Fred's right, it's not the flu. - No it's not the flu. - Sunny, you're seven weeks pregnant. - I beg your pardon. - Well, it's not impossible is it? - Helen, I just turned 50. - I know that, it's unusual but it does happen. - I'm not pregnant, I just started menopause, that's why I missed my period. What am I gonna do? How old is the little one? - Just turned a year. - Close together. - Oh you're not kidding. - Aren't you coming? - No thank you. - Anybody home? - In the kitchen. How'd you do? - Oh I was great I was serving deuce ad deuce ad. So Bill tried his little dink shot, I charged the net and drilled him. Game, set, match. So they will be taking us out for drinks on Sunday night. Even better Russ Stanton called and he thinks he can make a really great deal for the business. Now it's gonna take maybe a year to find the right buyer which to me sounds perfect. No comment? - Not really. You haven't changed your mind? - No. - About the boat, what? - Mick I went to Dr. Simmons today the way you wanted. - Oh hell. - No, no, no, don't get all frightened, there's nothing wrong. - Well what's wrong then? - I'm pregnant. - You're kidding. - Seven weeks. - How the hell did that happen? - What do you mean how the hell did that happen? - Weren't you using something? - Mick, I'm 50-years-old, I didn't think I could get pregnant. Now many years did we try after Dan? 10 years, that's how long, 10 years of shots and treatments and checking the calendar and taking my temperature and us being devastated when we realized I wasn't pregnant. And now I am. - We'll take care of this together. How long do we have? - I'm not sure. - Well if it's seven weeks. - No, I meant I'm not sure I want to take care of it. - That's not funny. - I'm not trying to be funny. - Look, you're 50-years-old, I'm older, we're getting ready to retire, there is nothing to think about here. You're upset, so am I, it's a shock, that's why the faster we deal with this... - Mick, what if I wanna have this baby? - And what if I don't. - I definitely want an amio. - There's another test we can get done sooner. CVS, chorionic villus sampling, we could get that done in the ninth week. - Why are we even having this discussion? 50-year-old women aren't supposed to be having babies. - Of course, it's riskier carrying a child to term when you're older. I'm not gonna pretend it's not. Sonya's got a vertical scar from her C-section and we're gonna have to watch that too. You are not in your 20's this time, let's just say you won't have the same spring in your step you had before. You'll tire more easily, you'll feel every ache, every pound. In my experience most older moms do okay. - What about down syndrome? - The risks there are higher, no question. But the tests will determine whether or not we have to worry about that. - You don't even wanna think about a baby do you? - Honestly, no, I don't. - I don't understand you we've always wanted a second child. - Not now, that was years ago. - This is a tremendously difficult decision. It can't be resolved in a day. I just want the two of you to have a clear idea of what's involved. - Oh I think it's clear what's involved, I'm just a sperm donor, no one wants to hear from me. - Don't you ever do that again. - I'm sorry. - Sperm donor. - Well that's how I feel. Do you realize how old I'd be when the kid turns 18? In my 70's, what happens if there's a problem, we're not gonna live forever. - We don't have to live forever, Mick. We're both healthy people. We're strong, we could be terrific parents, look how much more we know now than when we had Dan. - Oh I see what's going on here, you think about PTA meetings, little league, skinned knees and ear infections and you get all fuzzy. Well I think about PTA meetings, little league and I'm terrified. I've done that, Sunny, old business, I'm not there anymore. - I'm not sure you ever were. I'm sorry that wasn't fair. - It was fair. Look how it turned out with Danny and me. I was a crumby father. - You're not a crumby father. - What about us, what about everything we planned? - Nothing has to change. - Do you hear yourself, nothing will change, everything will change, Sunny everything? What is it with you, some ego thing that you can have a baby when your friends can't? - Now that's a nice thing to say. - Sunny, all I'm asking is that you calm down and rationally think this through. - I am calm. This is my last time. In my 20's and 30's I used to think, oh it could still happen but it didn't, it happened now. This is the last time our bodies will ever make new life. I'm not saying that I absolutely positively have to have this baby. I'm just saying that right now I can't not have this baby. - Hi. Sunny what is it? - I'm fine. Are we supposed to deliver the Woman's Day's Club order or are they picking it up? - Sunny we've known each other forever, don't pretend with me. - I'm pregnant. - Oh my god, so what... - Don't even ask the next question. I don't know what I'm gonna do. - Well I don't have to state the obvious do I? I mean, you and Mick are home free. People talk about making their dreams come true but I mean, you're actually in a position of making it happen. - That's what makes it so much harder. Especially for him. - You're the one who's pregnant Sunny. - Oh I know, I'm scared, how do you make a choice like this? - Hey Grandma! - Hi sweetheart. - We're surprising Mommy for Valentine's Day, can we Grandma, can you make a bouquet? - I certainly can. - Hey Ann, you show Ben what you got? Oh yeah, you bet ya. You like roses? - Yep. - Okay. - We have star lilies too. - It's fine whatever. - So, what's up? - I came up with a new thruster design. - That sounds good. - It is good but my timing was all screwed up. Mom, I feel like every time I try to show Dad that I can handle things he takes it the wrong way. - Did you tell him that? - You don't tell him, you listen. He didn't have any time anyway, Russ Stanton showed up. I know who he is Mom. He was just profiled in the Wall Street Journal. - Look, I know he wants to talk this over. - Yeah, right. - I'm so sorry honey. You'll still have a job there. - Mom. - Look Daddy, she's gonna be really surprised. - Good going, come here buddy. Good going. We'll talk later. - Bye Dan. - Let's go. - I was gonna tell him and then he throws this new prototype at me. And how the hell could I figure that he'd know who Russ Stanton was? - He's a bright boy. - Yeah. - Sometimes you under estimate him. How is the prototype? - It was great except he did it while he was supposed to be working on something else. So how can I stand there and say oh wow Dan, that's terrific, I can't. - He told me he screwed up. - He did, well that's something. - Happy Valentine's Day. - Happy Valentine's Day to you. - Oh, thank you. Can I go first. - Please. - I'm not too greedy. Oh honey, that is beautiful. - I bought it before this came up. - I better wear it quick, huh? - Not funny. - Let's not lose our sense of humor. Open yours. - Ah, I wander what this is, maybe a book. - It's about a family that lives on a boat, a whole family. - Sunny. - I'm still considering what you said. - On who's terms? - I just wanna have the test, that's all just to see. - And then what? If I agree to that it would just be for you, it wouldn't mean I was on board about a baby. You're just buying some time Sunny. The longer you put this off, the harder it's gonna be. - I know you don't mean to sound so cold. - I don't wanna get roped into anything, Sunny. I don't wanna wake up one day and you're six months pregnant and it's too late. But thank you for the book, I know you mean it. - Recording sound waves as they bounce off the fetus. - Mick, look. - Normal nine week development. This is still new to us. We thought we were out of the baby making business, right honey? - Okay you can get dressed now. I'll call you when I get the test result. - You should see your face. - What? - You want this baby. - Oh Mick I do. I want you to want the same thing. - Not gonna happen. - It will, I believe it will. - Is that how you're justifying this, this unilateral decision? - Maybe I am. This is a child we made together, out of our love and how we feel about each other after all this time. Has to be a reason, I have to believe there's a reason. How could we not have this baby? - One of us is gonna have to give on this Sunny. You should see your face. Have your baby Sunny but I just can't make any promises. - I'll be right back. This is the last batch. We got 40 joint seals that still need to be anodized, urethaned. Skip and Roger are doing the prelims. - How do they look? - Oh they're fine. - Let me see the specs. - They're fine. - Mick. - What are you doing here? - Dr. Carlyle called. - Yeah. - It's a girl. - No kidding. - Everything's fine. - Great. - You mean it, you weren't hoping for bad news? - Come on Sunny give me a little credit. - You have my word on it, we'll still have the boat. I'll do whatever it takes to make it happen. You wanna tell Dan with me, please? - Sure. Oh my god. Guys congratulate me I'm gonna have a baby sister! - Hi Dad. - Hi hon. - Brought you some banana bread. - Oh thanks, sweetheart, an old favorite. - Oh the garden looks so beautiful. - Oh it's terrific this year. - Dad, did you and Mom ever want more kids? Like you, not on your life. Are you trying to tell me something? - Yes. - Oh brother, so how far along is she? Man that house of theirs is awful small. - Who we talking about? - Jenna and Dan, we're talking about Jenna, right? - No, Dad, we're talking about me. I just started my third month. - What? - It's not impossible. - No, no, it's just that you guys didn't have one of those artificial... - No Dad. - Sorry. - Amazing. - It's not that amazing. - God I wish your mother was here for this. - Me too. It's gonna be a girl. - Little girl. How's Mick doing? - So far Mick's just doing it for me. - He'll come around, what choice does he have? A million things can go wrong with kids, the miracle is just having one at all. - Mick, I heard, big news. - Yeah. - What's the matter you don't wanna be the oldest daddy in your play group. - Spare me will you, just between us guys it's not exactly how I planned to spend the rest of my life. - Sunny know how you feel? - Yeah, I'm the only fly in her ointment. - I'm sorry. - I'll get over it or at least, I'm hoping I will. - Hey look on the bright side, it'll keep you young. - Why does everybody keep telling me that? - Hey Mick, congratulations. - Thanks. - Didn't think you had it in you. - Hey Tony Rambles just had another one. - He did not. - Just what I heard and look at Michael Douglass. - I'd like to believe me. - Better you than me pal. - Hey Mick why don't you just give me the new boat, since you're not gonna be using it. - Who says, we're going on our usual Memorial Day trip. - We are? - Sunny, it'll be about five and a half months long. - This baby is gonna fold into our world, not the other way around. - What's she been drinking? - Virgin Marys. - Well, here's to dear friends and their active retirement. Cheers. - Fantastic ladies, let's try the other side. Roll yourself slowly over, great, keep your knees bent and let's take that leg up and down. Let's go a little quicker, let's take it up and down, up and down, that looks great. - Hi. - Hi. I'm Sunny Andrews, I called. - Oh hi I'm Debbie, nice to meet you. Let's have four more of those ladies. Looks good, three and two. - Should I just take a mat? - Yeah, sure hang on just a sec. Hold it up and pulse, pulse, pulse, little pulse, two, three, and hold. This is from our lawyers, anyone over 45. Looks good and pulse, pulse and slowly lower it down, looks great. Thanks, you can stick that green mat right there. All right, lower the leg down, we're gonna do the dip now. Take your leg up, dip the knee down, bring the knee back to center and lower down, do it again. Up, turn, turn and down. Up, turn, turn. - You okay? - Yeah. - I need a hand to come about. Wanna take the wheel? - No I can handle this! - Okay, ready to jive? - Yes. - Honey, honey. Sweetheart. - I'm not about to lecture you Sunny but what were you thinking? - I've been out on the water a million times. Is she all right? - It's premature labor, strong contractions but no bleeding, so far there's no fetal distress. Your cervix isn't dilated but we need to keep her inside. I'm giving you a tocolytic to relax the uterus and stop the contractions. You'll need to stay here for a few days in complete bed rest. - Bed rest. - To and from the bathroom, up for meals and not much else. - The whole pregnancy? - You can't middle this Sunny. You know the old saying you can't be a little pregnant. Mick outside? - No, now don't be angry at him, it was my fault. - Why do I get the feeling this is not the whole story? You wanna talk about it? - No. - Well if you do, you know where to find me. - I've forgotten how pretty you are when you're pregnant. I hope she looks just like you. Isn't it gonna be something Mick? Little girls are so crazy about their dads. - Yeah, enough to do? - Oh I'm sending out flyers to your classmates for updates, I'm making a little reunion booklet. And there's that is latest in baby information and of course I am gonna organize 30 years of family photos. And that's just today. - What do you think? - Keep the one you got. - Oh great. And before I forget, Ann called, I told her you'd phone later, why didn't you tell me that you'd hired a part-time manager? - It's temporary, Ann needs the help right now. And I'm not exactly pulling my own weight. - Don't overdo it. - Pulling my own weight. - Anybody here? - In the living room. - Hey, I'm off to going, you look good. - Well, first thing after she's born, I'm gonna get my hair colored. Look at you. - I just popped in to give you a hug and say goodbye. Don't you dare give birth before we get back. Today's the day, Africa. - Oh my god, I can't believe I forgot. - I'm sorry I know how much you guys wanted to go. I actually thought about canceling it. - If you waited for us it could be another 18 years. - Yeah, Bill and I need this. - Yeah maybe you guys can be reminded of all the reasons you got married in the first place. - That's what I'm hoping. Okay I gotta go. Don't you think about the store once, okay, 'cause Claire's really working out, she's got plenty of backup, all right. - Have a wonderful trip. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Really? - You lie on your back for four months, gives you too much time to think and feel sorry for yourself. Would you have done this if you were me? - Not if I wanted to hold onto Bill but Mick's different. Okay I'm off, you be good, I love you. - I love you, bye. - Bye-bye. - Don't worry about me, I'll be all right. - Bring me back a monkey. - Bye. - Did you forget something? - Hello. It's like Grand Central Station, I just ran into Ann. How you doing, you okay? - I think so, I was just revving up for a good cry. - Well, don't let me stop you. - Mick is so busy. And I used to be gone all the time too. Now I just lie here like a whining whale. Okay I'm done. This is some lucky baby. - That is for you. - Oh. "Out of Africa." - Want me to read it to you? I had a farm in Africa at the foot of the Negomios. The equator runs across these highlands 100 miles to the north and the farm lay at an altitude of over 6,000 feet. - Oh Ann, it's adorable, look, look. - Isn't that great, I couldn't resist. - Oh, Samantha and I thank you. - Oh okay, I go away for two weeks and look what happens, you've chosen a name. Why did you pick Samantha? - In honor of Mick's father, Sam. - Oh so nice. - Look at those shoes. Who'd a thought we'd be doing this at our age? - Yeah, really we should be gathering up at the dermatologist for collagen treatments. - No, no, no, no, no, he'd be taking away those little spider veins. - I can live with those. I woke up one morning I had my grandmother's arms. - What about the stretch marks. - Shh. - All right let's tackle the mysterious one. Oh look it's a trick box. Oh look, oh sweetheart it's perfect. - It's a car seat. - I wasn't born yesterday. - Yeah that's the problem. - Oh, oh, oh. - What? It's Braxton hicks, it's fine. - It's false labor, it's been going on for a couple of weeks now. Everything's fine, now what else did you bring me? - Sunny, Sunny, Sunny, oh god. - It's tearing, it feels like something's tearing. - I'm calling 911. - Vitals are good, sponges. - I was gonna come in here and skate right through this. - Scissors. - You're doing great honey. - You're on a pass Sunny, if we had known your uterus had ruptured from the old scar you wouldn't have got a spinal, you'd be out cold right now. - I'm very grateful. - You should be, suction. Give me clamps. - You okay? - I'm fine. - Last time you were stuck in the father's waiting room. This is progress, huh? - I'm not so sure. - I can see your baby. - Is she all right? More suction. Would you like to do the final cutting of your daughter's cord? - I think I'll pass. - She's something else. - Oh hello Samantha, it's okay. - Hey. - Hey - Sorry I'm late. - Daddy's here, he says he's sorry he's late. Oh look at that, little ear. Oh, oh, the busy hand. Oh she's such a girl. Wanna hold her. - Oh no. - She doesn't mind. Meet Sammy. She's been asking for you. - I made it. - Sit. - Easy for you to say. - It is like riding a bike, you just have to slide back on. How was your day? - Among other things, I signed the final papers on the boat. - You did? - Well you wanted me didn't you, that was the plan? I know I made it sound impossible going off on the boat with a baby. But you're right, it's not, nothing has to change, at least not till she's ready for school. - Hey, oh look who's here, Ben. - Oh look. - Hey little lady. - I got her, I got her. - Careful. - She squeaks. - She's almost as dainty as her big brother. Ben, say hello to your aunt Samantha. Ooh that's silly, how could she be your aunt? That's Aunt Samantha. What do you think? - Sunny, Sunny look at the camera. - I'm looking Dad, I'm looking. Hi Dad. - Now don't move too fast now. - She's coming this way. - Keep it here. - Oh it's Grandpa. - Say hello to Grandpa. Say hi Grandpa. Hi Grandpa. - Oh it's such a oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, see Grandpa you make her cry too. - Come on, okay here's Grandpa again, say hi Grandpa. - Hi, hello world, hello. - Okay. - All right Dad, that's enough, Dad, Dad, turn it off. I got it. - Did my dad go. - Yeah, what would you like me to bring for dinner? - You have to leave so soon? - Yeah, Russ Stanton's coming in. Listen honey, did Danny say anything to you about looking for work? - No, what makes you think that? - I don't know, it's just a gut thing. - Why don't you ask him. Look you don't have to bring anything back, I'll have soup if I'm hungry. - Oh thanks. So long Sammy. - Change your pants. Oh my you got me more. - We're up. - Yes, ma'am, yes ma'am oh look at the smile. Oh goodness, okay, okay, that's the girl, yes. - Hi. - Daddy's here. - How's she doing? - Fine. It's almost 11. - Oh I know. Bill called just as I was leaving, he wanted to see the boat so we swung by on the way home. I wanted to call but I was afraid I'd wake you. - I was just about to change her. Why don't you do it. Oh well. Oh here, here, here, here. It's been a long time since I've done this little girl. Don't expect too, oh come on. Sunny. - It's okay. - Brand new one how old? - Three weeks. - Oh. - We haven't been out since she was born. I was starting to get a little crazy. - You're welcome, first time? - Here or her? - Both. - I have a grown son and a grandson, he's six-years-old. - Courageous aren't you? - I knew it would be different at my age but I didn't really get it. - No regrets I hope. - No regrets. And no energy. - I know that feeling. I'm Leigh. - Sunny. - That's my daughter. - Oh, she's darling. - This is Samantha. - Oh in vitro? - No the old fashioned way, surprise, surprise. We're still trying to adjust, my husband especially. What about you? - Oh adopted from Ecuador and the only adjustments I have to make are for me and for her. I'm a single mom. - Now that's courageous. - I haven't found a him yet but I wasn't gonna wait any longer and my brother's real involved so that helps. And sometimes I look at my friends and their marriages and I think. - You're just fine the way you are. - Hey baby and more importantly she is. - Hi. - Hi. - Well, we only came out for a few minutes, my husband's favorite dinner is burning in the oven. Come back okay. - If I can remember how to get here, I'm so sleep deprived, I'm like a POW. What happened to calling if you're gonna be late? This is the second time this week. - I'm sorry the time completely got away from me. - I told you I was making a nice dinner. - I know, the meetings ran late. The first buyer wants to bring in his own people and the second group, this mom and pop operation wants to relocate to San Clemente. And then I ran into Brody and... - Mick stop. - I'm sorry, I knew I should have called. - Is this it, is this what I can expect? - I apologize for gosh sakes. Look, I've been under a lot of pressure lately. - You've been under a lot of pressure, I just had a baby! - Okay, fine, in the pressure department you win, hands down. - What is it with you? - You know I'm not the only one with a business, you got a business too so why is it I am the only one who's selling? - What's the hurry, we're not setting sail tomorrow? - Oh I can see that, I'm getting the picture Sunny. First, you wanna lease the boat, not buy. Then you wanna lease the house, not sell and now today in the middle of a god awful meeting with people I hated, I realized you haven't made any plans to sell your shop, so I was just wondering Sunny, are you just lying about the boat? - Just because you had a bad day doesn't mean... - No, this isn't about my bad day Sunny. We were going to retire, we had plans. - We planned to have three kids and a vineyard in Napa by the time you were 30. Things change, you're not the only one who sacrificed. I think she's worth it. Are you so excited to be a sailor? Almost there. - Look here Sammy. I think you're gonna like this. Mick, it's great. - And when she outgrows this one I've got an idea for an activity center that'll go right over there. Or maybe we'll just get a bigger boat. - It's terrific. - Oh, oh, oh. - Give her a minute, let her get used to it. - She wants out, Mick. - She does the same thing when you put her in the crib at home. - Oh Sammy, oh it's okay baby. Would you get a rattle or the bunny. - Maybe she's starting to teeth? - It's too soon. Look what Daddy found for you. Oh what is it, come on, come on. Let's go outside. - I'm trying to make this work, Sunny. I'm thinking that we can be ready to go by next summer. We'll take it slow, we'll just go down the coast and pull in the coves. - By next summer she'll be crawling, she'll be so fast. - We'll put her in a harness. That's what the family did in the book you gave me and we'll be with her all the time. - And pulling four hour shifts on the boat, sounds great. - Is that sarcastic? - You have to admit it's not gonna be a piece of cake. - This is how you wanted it. - I know what I said but we have to be reasonable. By next summer, she'll be pulling herself up. - By next summer, she'll be an old hand. - How can she pull herself up when the boat is tilting? What if she slips, what if something hits her? - That could all happen just as easily at home. - At home we are 10 minutes from a hospital. - You don't wanna do this. - I didn't say that. - Everything but. - I thought we could do this. - No you didn't, you're a smart woman, you knew better. You were working me Sunny, damn you, all this time, you've been working me. I shouldn't have left like that. - We managed. - I don't wanna lose us. - Me either. I'm so sorry I slept right through the alarm and Mick had to go in early. - Al Bowman's coming at nine. - Al Bowman? - The wholesaler. You did bring the order list? - Oh shoot I left it at home. I'll be back in 10 minutes. - No there's no time, Sunny, you knew I had this appointment. - I'm really sorry. Look we can go by last year's order. I'll handle it. - Okay, and I know it's not the best time but I need a couple days off. - Is everything okay? - No not really. - What's the matter. - I just need the time, Friday and Monday. - Okay. - Okay thanks. - She doesn't sleep. Oh sure in the day time but at 3 o'clock in the morning, she's ready to boogie. - How are you dealing with the shop on top of all this? - A customer came in the other day and dropped off a brochure on narcolepsy. My best friend hates me because we're in business together and I'm not pulling my weight. And yesterday I realized I will never go to the bathroom alone again. - And Mick? - I keep hoping things will get better. - Have you thought about a nanny? - It just doesn't feel right. - Well are you supposed to do everything yourself? - That's my job isn't it? - Don't be ridiculous, you're lucky you can afford it and you're not 23 you said so yourself. Why don't you cut yourself a little slack. Call her, she's got really qualified people. It's gonna be okay. - Yeah, just keep reminding me how noble we vintage mothers are. - Mom, do you want me to take them to the printer? - Dad will take care of it. - I don't know why you're doing this, it's his reunion, he volunteered. - Well, Jenna does things for you, it's part of being married. - Yeah but I appreciate them. - Lighten up on your father, you know how busy he is. - I do. So what do you think the chances will be of him selling the business to me? - You want the business. - Mom, Jenna and I have talked about it and yeah, I've done some exploratory research. Of course, I can't pay cash or anything. - Pay cash for what, don't tell me you're thinking about buying another new car. - No actually I was talking about Andrews Undersea Labs. - What? - Well, I'm the logical buyer aren't I? I mean, Dad when I was in school I switched from art to business so I could learn, that's what you wanted. - Well sure. - Well, I always figured this was why. - Yeah, but I didn't know I was gonna be ready to retire. - I can come up with a fourth now and with deferred compensation, I'll be able to service the debt, I've done my homework. - I can see that. - It'll save you a big commission. Of course, I'd expect to split it. - Well, I'm kind of at a loss for words here. - Well, it's good to see I can still surprise you old man. I gotta go, take your time, think it over. Sure. - Thanks again for all your help. - No problem. - Did you know about this. - No, well you got here just in time, I have to be at the shop in 20 minutes. - What? - Mick why are you here. - I just came home to change my shirt, I'm meeting some guys at the club. - We talked about this, you agreed. Ann is off today and Claire has to leave at four. I have to go in. - No, no, wait a minute. - Samantha's been asleep for awhile. There's a fresh bottle in the refrigerator. Oh, she'll be wet and probably poopy. - Maybe you can take her with you. - Can't Mick, sorry. - Oh. - Now be sure you don't over water it. Enjoy your day, thanks bye-bye. Hey, I thought you were taking the day off. - Bill's gone. - What? - This woman he works with. - Oh Ann, I can't believe it. - Me either, not until last week, then I started to think that something was wrong, that's why I wanted the time. Well he's been lying about everything. - I wish I knew what to say. - And they've using your boat. - What? - Mick let them use the boat. - Are you here? - Oh Brody what are you doing here, where's Mick? - He called, he's in a jam so he asked me to babysit. I changed her and I put her pacifier in the freezer, she's been a little fussy and I know it's early but I think she's cutting a tooth. Yeah. - We can always count on Uncle Brody can't we? Don't. - What are you doing? - Waiting for you. - Oh it's late, I'm tired. - It's always late, you're always tired. You're never here. You couldn't even spare time to take care of your own daughter. - Let's don't make a big deal out of this. I promised Frank... - You promised me. - You wanna talk about broken promises, don't do it, Sunny. If we both kept ours we wouldn't be fighting like this, we wouldn't have anything to fight about. - I think you should go stay on your boat. You breeze in here for 30 seconds every once in awhile, take a shower, change your clothes and then you're gone again. It's not working for me. I don't wanna live like that. - Sunny, you're being ridiculous. - I don't think so. I think you should move out until you know what you want. - Oh I know what I want, I've been very clear about that all along. - You're right, you have. And you didn't get it, you can still have your boat and sail around the world and live out your fantasies just not with me. - Oh come on, stop it. I'm here. - You're not. The only ones here are Sammy and me. Please don't come back until you're sure this is what you want. No. - Have it your way, I'll pack a bag. - Mick, how could you let Bill use the boat? He's been part of my life since junior high. Tomorrow, I keep thinking, he'll come home tomorrow. - Is that what you want? - Yeah but I want it to be the way it was. - Before Samantha? - Yeah. - Can you be honest with yourself for a minute? - Yeah. - What's different? - Besides the baby? - Yes. - We want different things, we always wanted the same things. - Or you went along. - Whatever, it worked. Right, this is the first time it's been my decision. The first time I've wanted something. - In how long? - A lifetime. - This is a list of the numbers you'll need, the doctor, my number at work, my daughter-in-law's number and my pager number. - Okay. - Your hours may change a little. - I'm flexible. - Since our interview my husband has moved out. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Well, if you were needed before, you're a godsend now. - I can't replace her father, Mrs. Andrews. - I know. But another voice, someone to read to her, to be there when she wakes up. - "Goodnight Moon." - I beg your pardon. - Does she like "Goodnight Moon?" - Oh, she loves it. - Well then I think we're on the right track. - Goodnight nobody, goodnight mush. And goodnight to the old lady whispering hush. Goodnight stars and goodnight air, goodnight noises everywhere. - Mom, hey is Dad around? I think I can come up with some more float money. Mom what's wrong? A little late for post-baby blues, wanna share? - Your dad hasn't talked to you? - No, what's the matter. - He's on the boat. He's staying on the boat. - What? - He moved out. - He left you and the baby? - I told him to go. - Well why did you do that? Never mind I know why, I'm sorry. I gotta go. - Dan, you calm down before you talk to him. - He needs to hear this. - Danny? - You selfish bastard, what were you thinking? - Come on this isn't the time or the place. - Take a break. - Now just a minute here. - Go on take a break. - It's okay guys go ahead. We'll catch up tomorrow. Who the hell do you think you are? - You are a real sorry bastard. Look at you with your big fancy boat. - I've earned this boat, I've worked hard my whole life. - Oh I know I've heard you plenty. Who cares how hard you worked Dad. It didn't turn out like you wanted so who cares. - You don't know squat about hard work, I made it too easy for you. And you were always taking, you always had your hand out. - Because that's all you had to offer. How long you been here? How long have you been living on the boat, simple question Dad? - About a week. - A week. You've been going to work, doing business, having meetings, sending memos. - This is private, between your Mom and me. - No, no don't put this off on Mom. She might have told you to leave but she had a damn good reason. Do you think that Jenna and I and everyone else haven't noticed how disappointed you look? You think you're hiding how much you blame her? You might have spoiled me but look at you. Look at you the minute you don't get everything you want, the minute you're not calling all the shots, you're out of there. My Dad, my hero, have fun on your boat captain. Captain of nothing, that's what you earned. - Hi. - I rang the bell and nobody answered. So I saw your car, I figured you'd be out here. I heard, sorry. - Thanks. - I'm gonna miss you tomorrow at the reunion. - Yeah, well it's not my class anyway, you people are old. Don't remind me. - I'll miss it too thanks. - You seeing him? - Not really, he's coming by today to pick up the baby. - I am really not good with words. I never told you how I felt about you. Not really. - Don't Brody. - No I want to, I kept my big mouth shut before, it's the worst mistake I ever made in my life. - I'm not so sure of that. - I am. I always thought that you were gonna be there and then one day you weren't. I was always my best self with you. - Brody I'm still married. - I know that. I'm just saying that, if anything changes, and you're not. - Hi. - Hi. - Hey little girl. Ooh you're getting heavy. - Don't forget her bag. - You look good. - Thanks. - Did you get the check. - Oh yeah, thanks. - How's the nanny working out? - She's fine. - Good. - I hate to see you burning all your bridges at once. - What are you talking about? - Dan, he has done everything he can to earn your respect. He quit art school, he learned your business and he learned it well for you. And you still treat him like an ungrateful kid. Don't let him down this time Mick, you'll lose him too. I don't have to give you instructions on her do I? - No. I'll have her back by five, say bye-bye. - Bye-bye baby. - You guys have done a wonderful job. - Sunny did every bit of this, don't give me any credit. - Trust me we won't. - Ah, Danny how'd it go? - Adequate, but there's still some work to be done on the seams. How's your weekend? - Fine I had the baby for most of Friday. - Yeah, first time alone? - Yeah, I suck at it, I always did. - Well, you said it I didn't. - I need you to take over here for a couple of days. - What's wrong? - Nothing, I'm gonna take the boat out. - Why didn't I guess. - You know you don't know everything about me. - I know enough. - All I know is work. After my dad died we found out he let his life insurance lapse, he didn't have a dime. God I resented him, I had to work just to put food on the table. I lied about it at school, I wasn't ready to be the head of the family, I just wanted to be a kid. And I never let anybody know how bad it was, not even your mom. But I told myself that I would never do that to my child, that I would never give him that kind of responsibility, that kind of fear. I just wanted you to feel safe, to feel secure. - I just wanted a dad. - I know and I look at you now with Ben and I see the man, the father that I wish I could have been for you, Danny and I'm sorry. That's what I came to say I'm sorry. - Okay, I appreciate it. - And I can't change what's over but I was hoping we could give it another try. - What do you mean? - We could work something out. I looked over your offer, you did a good job, it's a good plan, but I figure maybe I'm just not ready to let go all the way yet. Maybe we could partner up for awhile? - Well I don't know sometimes we can barely be in the same room together. - Not with me running the show, I swear but us together, spending time together. Like I said I can't go back but I'd sure like a shot at getting to know the man you are now. - I don't know. - Well, that's okay, this time you think about it. - Dad. - Yeah? - Take your time on the boat, I can handle things here. - I know you can. I do know you can. - Night, night, love you. Rosemary? - I wanna come home. - Not the way it was. - Not the way it was. I just don't know where to start. - Why don't you start with the truth. - The truth. The truth is you asked me to leave. - And the truth is you wanted to go. You were relieved, you were off the hook. - I never let myself off the hook but you're right. I was relieved. - Then why are you here? You want your boat, your trip around the world. - I thought I did, but it wasn't really the boat I wanted, it was being with you. My life doesn't mean anything without you Sunny. I'm so scared of screwing up the way I screwed up with Dan. - Is that what you think you did? - Oh that's what I know I did. Everything he is and he's a great kid is because of you. - No everything he is is because of him and us. I couldn't have done it without you. - I love you Sunny and I wanna come home. With no more holding back and no more skipping out on the hard parts. - She doesn't sleep, not the way she's supposed to anyway. - Let me try. Maybe they're right, maybe Samantha's gonna keep us young. I'm glad you feel that way. You can take the 4 a.m. feeding.
