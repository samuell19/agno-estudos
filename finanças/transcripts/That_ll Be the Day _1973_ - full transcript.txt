Hey, um... - Have a look out the front, Dad. - Yes. - We don't want him to surprise us! - No, no. Woken up in time to meet your daddy, have you, Jimmy? He'll be here soon. I'll bet he can't wait to see you. You're the one he always asks about. Mary! Mary, he's here! Come on, love. Where's your flag? Here. Let's go and meet him, shall we, eh? Go on now, you run and meet your daddy. Eh? Run! And here's me thinking you'd still be a baby. There wasn't much to do, what with rationing. We had some nice days out. Went to the zoo once. And half an ounce of Battle Axe. Settling in nicely, are you then, Mr MacLaine? Never liked the shop. Oh, yeah, you remember Joe? Our Lucy's boy. Well, he never come back. Bored him. He sent a letter saying he was on his way. But he never come. It was all too small for him. I bet you never thought you'd have such a lovely boy waiting for you. Eh? Jim... you know I tried to settle down again. I was looking forward so much to coming home. But you've no idea. I want you to be a good boy for your mum and your grandad. You'll be all right, Mary. You... You have the shop and your dad and Jimmy. Look after your mother for me, will you, son? 1914, with the outbreak of the First World War, we come to the end of our survey of the syllabus for this year's exam. Now, you all know the routine for Monday. I hope you've got all the facts firmly established in your minds. Because at this stage, there's nothing much I can do to help you. You've got the weekend free... for last-minute revision. Oh, and I would like to remind you that that old favourite, "Outline the events leading up to the French Revolution", hasn't been set for two years and so you never know. MacLaine. What did Britain gain from the Treaty of Utrecht? The Hudson's Bay territory, Gibraltar, Menorca and Louis XIV agreed to recognise the Hanoverian claim to the English throne. Sir. Oh. Well, pay attention and fasten that tie, will you? I've nothing more to say to you. It's up to you. And so, as it's nearly four o'clock... Coming to the coffee bar, Terry? Well... Did you hear what George Sherman said he did with his sister? No. - What? - Come on, I'll tell you. ♪ Why was I born too late? ♪ Born too late ♪ For you to care... ♪ Two Cokes, please. - You're early. - Nicked off from cricket. - How's the band? - Great! Dave's got a new Gibson for his birthday. Yeah, his old one went up in a bloody great flash at the dance last Saturday! Fused the whole place. Nearly blew us all up. Two coffees, please, love. Oi. Got any money for the jukebox? Yes. What do you want on? You choose. See what your taste's like. What you gonna do next year? I dunno. Have to wait and see. What about you? I'm going as a receptionist to County Motors. Is that what you call it? Are you coming? No, I think I'll wait a bit longer. I'll see you on Monday. Another Coke? Two Cokes, please. And a shilling for two sixpences. Thank you. We're going to the Floral Hall tomorrow night. Are you coming? - What do you think, Shirl? - Can we trust 'em? We weren't interrupting anything, were we? Well... I'll be seeing you. - Two pounds of sugar, was it, love? - That's right, Mrs MacLaine. Well, as I was saying, we discussed it and I think he realises now that he's university material. Oh, it's all right for a hobby, of course. But you can't get anywhere without proper qualifications. None of them seem to realise that nowadays. Oh, they're all pie-in-the-sky ideas... Queuing all parts now, queuing all parts. Hey, there's Jim. Hey! Hello. Hello. - Did you bring Terry? - No, he's swotting. - Shouldn't you be? - No. Don't have to. I'm more clever. More big-headed too. Here, Jeanette! Tell Terry he should've stayed with me last night. That Shirley, sex mad. And her friend's a raving nympho! Disgusting! How do you feel? Okay. - You're not nervous? - No. Well, this is the first big hurdle. Oh, I wish I'd had your opportunities. Just think... by October you'll be at university. That'll be nice, won't it, Dad? Mm. They'll make him get his hair cut when he gets there, all right! Look, Mum, I've been thinking. Three years at university. That's a long time. Oh, I don't mind making a few sacrifices. No, I didn't mean that. I meant... You should know you can't argue with your mother. King Edward's, Mr Armitage? Thank you. Bye. Look, Mum, what I meant was, if I'm fed up now, what am I going to feel like in three years? It'll soon pass. Hey, come on! Look at the time. It's turned half past eight. All the best then, love. You go and show 'em. Jeanette said she saw you at the pictures on Saturday. Yeah. I've been working non-stop since Friday night. Water's getting lower. Bugger me, it's gonna be a scorcher! That's right. It's too bloody hot to be taking exams. Sod the Congress of Vienna! And bloody Napoleon! And the War of Jenkins' bloody Ear! What are you doing, you daft bugger? Sod it! You've gone mad. - Come on, I've got an extra pen. - I've had enough of sodding school. - Go on, you go on. - Jim! Tell 'em... Tell 'em I've got Jenkins' Ear ache! Madame de Pompadour was, I think, a silly old whore. She made a pie from Jenkins' Ear and washed it down with a bottle of beer! You might at least let your mother know where you'll be. I don't think that's too much to ask. I shall have weeks of, "Like father, like son!" And for once, she'll be right. Brought your bucket and spade, have you, Tash? "Please, sir, may I leave the womb?" I might have said, but no one would have heard. So I gave up, ran away. And hitched a roller-coaster ride in search of fish and chips and freedom! Please, miss... have you got a room? Now, the rent is two pounds ten a week. You'll be able to manage that, will you? Well, in any case, it's in advance every week. Now, there's a lavatory two floors down and there's a bathroom on the first floor. If you're taking a bath, it's two shillings. Now, you have a lock on your door, so if you lose anything, it's no use coming moaning to me. And we have a very nice house here, so if you don't mind, you'll not be having any young ladies up here to entertain. It's really a very nice little room you have here. Like I say, it'll be two pounds ten in advance. Come on, concentrate on the job. Never mind the girls! There's three more deckchairs over there. - We're not very fond of the ladies, are we? - Oh, my God, she's at it again! - Come on! - Ta! That's right, love, later. Here... is there anything to do here in the evenings? ♪ Well, it's a darn good life and it's kinda funny ♪ How the Lord made the bee and the bee made the honey ♪ And the honey bee lookin' for a home ♪ And they called it a honeycomb ♪ Then they combed the world and they gathered all ♪ Of the honeycomb into one sweet ball ♪ And the honeycomb from a million trips ♪ Made my baby's lips ♪ Oh, honeycomb, won't you be my baby? ♪ Well, honeycomb, be my own ♪ Got a hank o' hair and a piece o' bone ♪ Made a walkin', talkin' honeycomb ♪ Well, honeycomb, won't you be my baby? ♪ Well, honeycomb, be my own ♪ What a darn good life when you got a wife ♪ Like honeycomb ♪ ♪ Come along and be my party doll ♪ And I'll make love to you, to you ♪ I'll make love to you ♪ Hey!

I see, dishonest now, are you? How much is it? I won't be here long. I've got work to do. I can't afford to idle my life away at the seaside. I got your postcard. I don't know what you think you're up to. - Why didn't you... - I don't know! You've lost weight. - That room you've got... - It's all right. Jim. Look. - If you came back home now... - No. Anything else you want? From home, I mean. There's my records and record player. Yeah, I might've known. You might need this. ♪ I never felt more like singing the blues ♪ Cos I never thought that I'd ever lose ♪ Your love, dear ♪ Why d'you leave me this way? ♪ The moon and stars no longer shine ♪ The dream is gone I thought was mine ♪ There's nothing left... ♪ Caught anything yet?

We can walk together. Oi! I broke in here, you know. That lock on that gate's never been too smart. Shall we go? Had a good night, have you? It's my birthday. That's nice. Must be lonely, your job. It can be. Me mum gave me some money to buy something with. I'm a madman when I'm drunk, you know. She wanted me to go to university, but I didn't... Hey! Mustn't it be great... I mean, to be famous. Not like that. Like Elvis! It must be great. Terry! Get out of it! You do that again, I'll... Well, about time. Well, bugger me. This all you could afford? I bet you're crawling with fleas. I've been waiting weeks to here this. Oh, I got three distinctions. Very good. Why did you do it? Do what? You know. Oh. I did it to see the books float down the river. - What did they say at school? - Oh, they thought you'd gone mad. You know when you didn't come in in the afternoon, they head went round to see your mum. She blamed me. You must have been daft, you know. You can't sell deckchairs the rest of your life. Don't worry about me. Something'll turn up. It just takes time. I might finish up being the first British rock 'n' roll deckchair-selling millionaire tycoon. I am the lone and looney man... who lives upon the sand. When I left home, I thought I'd be... the leader of the band. Bloody hell! Hello again, campers! This is Radio Sunshine. Just reminding all you super, suntanned, sunny people that the first sitting for dinner is now being served in the yellow canteen. One of the lads from the kitchens got caught climbing over the fence from camp B last night. Oh, tarting with the trifles. You should see 'em. These two chicks from Bristol or somewhere. Right slags and they didn't even get a sniff. - Do you know 'em? - Yeah. Like I said, useless. I wouldn't even touch 'em with yours. That is, if you've got one. I mean, we haven't seen much evidence of it, have we? Well, you know... I mean, don't worry about it. Just that some people are a bit more choosy where they put it. All I'm saying is, with all these birds round here lusting after it, and you're acting like a queer in a brothel. Come on, we'll be late for work.

Tonight's their night, lucky cows! They didn't look like much to me. We'll have to split 'em up. I'm not having you watching me on the job. Oh. What about if they don't fancy us? That one with the big tits, her name's Sandra. She looks a bit like Sandra Dee, doesn't she? All right, smart-arse! It's not that funny. Ha! I mean... Ah, it was when I was at sea, wasn't it? Got pissed. Well, I wasn't actually at sea. I used to work on the ferries between New Brighton and Liverpool. One night I was out of me skull and me mates talked me into it. Bastards! Come on! It's not that funny. Reminding you that the midnight movie, "Carry On Sergeant", is at 11:30 this evening in the camp cinema. I've been coming here for five seasons, you know. - Yeah? - Like a holiday to me. Well, after ten months on the bloody road with the fair, you need a break. What do you do on the fair? Dodgems. Good place for pulling the birds. Quick tickle, see if they go, and then round the back, get me end away. That reminds me. Let's go and order our slicers for tonight. Oh! Ah, missed it. - It's good practice this, you know. - Good practice for what? Getting things into holes. Oh. Hey, Sandra! Do you want any coaching with your grip?

You know. Not bad. I've had better. Here, do you want a hand? Oh, good on yer, mate. Thanks. Mustn't sap me strength, you know. - Yeah. Uh, and this? - Yeah, that's fine. You don't play the drums, do you? No, mouth organ. I mean, harmonica. Why? Well, I was just wondering. I, uh... I think what Mr Tempest is trying to say is that, uh... he'd like to get rid of me. But you can't, can you, Stormy? Ever thought... Ever thought of writing your own songs? What? I mean, instead of always doing crumby Cliff Richard songs. You ever thought about writing your own? No, not really. I can't write. Anyway, you've got to be American to write rock 'n' roll songs nowadays. Well, it's the words, innit? Well... All right, Honky-Tonk? Thanks for the hand, son. When first I got my end away, I wasn't much good, I'm ashamed to say. But night after night, I worked at my art, as often as not with a different... tart. Practice may not make perfect, but it's practically perfect fun. What are you writing then? A love letter. Oh, I bet. You make a lovely scoreboard. They should have told me when I came here they were putting me in with a sex maniac. You haven't been able to keep it still for a minute. I thought I was a bastard, but you... This fair you go to. Yeah. I'm off next week. I'm just pissed off at being locked up in here. Do you reckon there's a job there for me? Stud farm's the best place for you. Mmm. Any more for the merry-go-round? When you two little lads are finished playing whoops-a-daisy... Just testing the cars, Jack. Don't want any nasty accidents, do we? Well, take your pal and go and help Doreen on the coconuts. Okay. Come 'ead. You've gotta watch him, Jim. He can be a right twat. I once saw him knife a big spade cos he wouldn't get off the children's hobby horses. Three down. A quick nibble round the back of the tent, eh, Doreen? - Oh, go and nibble yourself. - Oh, Christ, common as muck. But a heart of gold, ask any of the lads. - Thought you might need some help. - Look, piss off, both of you. Jesus Christ! All right, Gary? It's not much admittedly, but it's home and it's free. You're right, it's not much. Christ, what d'you expect? Listen, all we're here for is to work and sweat, and work and fiddle. Right, fiddle. It's the game. Everyone knows it. So don't you go and cock it up for the rest of us by being honest. It's a shilling for them and a shilling for you. And wear your pants with the biggest pockets. They know it goes on, but as long as you're not bloody obvious, it's all right. They turn a blind eye. That way, they pay us sod all and we have to work all the hours God sends. The easiest way is to work it so that you've never got the right change. The cars are always started before you've taken the money, anyway. So that when you get round to giving the change, you have to jump on the back of the car and stuff it into their hands while they're busy looking where they're going. And for Chrissake, don't pick on anyone in a gang or you've had it. Don't forget, it's one for you and one for them. One for you and one for them. If you get challenged, you've got to weigh it up. Whether you think you can get away with it or not. If it's half a sheet, you usually can. A pound only can get tricky, but it depends on the customer. If he's left it too late, you can always say you've never seen him before. I'll back you up. Then it looks as though he's trying to do you. It's all a matter of style. Good money though, isn't it? You'll like Bath. Better class of fuck there. I'll have to go now. My mum will go mad. No! You won't tell anyone, will you? Been doing some gardening again, have you? What, that little schoolgirl? Christ! She was insatiable. Well, you're no bloody Jesus! All I'm saying is, pick on someone you're own size. Just piss me off sometimes you do. Tough. Sodding cue. Didn't they teach you anything in that orphanage? Yeah, they taught me how to look after meself. It was great. Well, the first one was. There was this matron, organised a birthday party for me when I was eight. She made a cake with icing and candles, you know. She was called Miss Wakefield. She used to smell of hospitals, but she was okay. She used to call me Mickey Rooney, cos I was so little. And then she got moved somewhere else. Makes you tough though, independent. When I was 14, me mother came to see me. - And I told her to piss off. - Here, hold on. You told me your mum was killed in the war. Did I? Well... I lie a lot. - You what? - I gave you ten bob. - I don't think so, chief. - I did, didn't I? - Bloody right! - Oh, come on, the pair of you, piss off! I'll tell my friend! You've had it! This one's mine, Jimmy boy, keep your hands off. For you, anything! Whoo! Hello, darlings! Here we are! Oh, money as well! Hey. Where's Tweedledum? He's working. Should I give you some help? You're always too late. Six broken ribs, a collarbone done for and 24 stitches in his side. I can't understand why he wasn't missed, being gone so long. What about you then? How do you fancy working on the whip? I was going to move Mike but, uh... I don't expect we'll see him for a while. Think you can handle it? Cos... it can be a bit dangerous. But the money's better. Yeah. No sweat. Okay. Thanks! Hello? Hello, could I speak to Terry Sutcliffe? Hello? Terry? It's Jim. Remember? "Monica's Mouth Organ" by James MacLaine. The mouth organ tremored, jumped a scale or two, and quavered at the sight of her crotchet. With trembling vibrato, he undid her discord and percussion in softly, ran a quick cantata saying, "I'll do you no harm, Monica." Well! Where's the revolution, Fidel? See those girls there? - It's the same every night. - Yeah? Amazing. Whoo! You wouldn't believe it. Yeah, it's pretty much the same at college. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I mean, there's never any reason to go short. No. Well, what's the social life like? Oh, the dances aren't bad. Here, I tell you what, as you're off, do you want to give it a try? Why not? A couple of trips on the whip, then we'll go over to your place. See that. Perks of the job. So don't leave your change inside your pants' pockets, otherwise you're gonna lose it. Are you gonna be all right? See you in a minute. That silly bugger will kill himself one of these days. But he's a good operator. Yeah. Only, the best ones are dead ones. All right? Come and meet a couple of ladies I've fixed us up with. All right, so you didn't fancy yours. I didn't fancy mine much, but she didn't make me throw up. Everyone here likes trad. Oh, come on, admit it. Rock was just a craze. Bollocks! They'll be playing rock years after all of that... crap has been bombed and banned. You're still playing your mouth organ then? Meet two ladies I've fixed us up with. Jim. Suzanne and Charlotte. We all take economic history together. Oh, Jim and I used to be friends at school. What are you doing now? He works on a fair. What exactly do you do on the fair? Well, I'm the chief show-off. I mean, I pretend to be superman on the whip and do a death-defying routine. I'm the bloke that everybody wishes would fall into the machinery and get his kidney twisted round his ear. No, seriously, I'm just there to write a novel. It's nearly finished. It's all about life in the fairground. It's called "Vanity Fair". Or, "Jim The Whipper Had A Big Dipper". Shall we, uh...? Look... I must go. I've just seen some people. Goodnight, guv. Well, you coming? Got a room? I've got a bike. It's at the top. - Is that your baby? - Mm. And you leave it alone? The woman downstairs listens out for him. Come on. I didn't think you'd be slow. Fucking hell! Well? You must be very proud of yourself. How you've got the nerve to come back here after two years, I don't know. Turning up like that in the middle of the night. Hymn number 376. Selfish, that's you. Never a thought for how I might be getting on. The odd postcard when you found time to remember you had a mother. It's not been easy, you know, what with the shop and your grandad the way he is. How long has he been like that? Six months. You've no idea what it's been like. And you not knowing he's alive or dead. What happened to him? He's a lot of work, you know. And I never had a husband or a son to help me. And I managed without your father and I'll manage without you! Terry's done well, you know. I saw him. He's at the university now. A credit to his parents. You were always cleverer than him and you know it. But, oh no! Not you. If you did come back, what would you do? And how can I be sure you wouldn't be off again just as soon as the fancy took you. It wouldn't be so bad if you got your hair cut. You could always go to night school. Still not too late. You know, Mum, we could really do things with this little shop. I've been doing things with it for over 20 years. Modernisation, that's what it's all about. Maybe if I traded the bike in for a little van, you know, part-exchange. Perhaps you should've gone to art school. When this goes up, we'll have 'em queuing down the road. Perhaps you should sit down somewhere else for a minute. I thought it was you the other day, outside the salon. That's right. We didn't know you were coming home. Yeah, well, I wasn't. I came with Jean. She's Terry's girlfriend. - You remember her? - Maybe. I'm not sure. Jean's had to go, but I thought I might stay and put in some more practice. I'll give you a lesson. I mean, if you like. Right then, turn round. That's it. Now, left foot first. Right. Left. Right.

Never thought of you as a shopkeeper. Never thought of you as a footballer. That's it. With that, Mum, we move into the big time. Well. I suppose... it'll be very nice for taking your grandad out for drives in. The girls at the fair, what were they like? You can if you want to. Well... bugger me! Didn't your mum like it then?

No. Stag night. Won't be late. It's all right. You don't have to, you know. Jeanette would go mad if she could see me here with you. Oh, I think she'd understand. Why an earth are you getting married? I don't know. I mean... why does anyone? Why doesn't someone believe me? I am not pregnant! He's never laid a finger on me. No, she's not. Anyway, let's not talk about tomorrow. Makes me nervous. But you don't know what he's like. He's girl mad. He's not! He's settled down. Always fancied you, you know. Strange. To think that tonight's my last night of freedom. I don't mind. It's that, it's a funny feeling. You don't know him like I do. It's no good telling me he's changed. He'll never change. It's more comfortable in the back. None of you will give him a chance! He's settled down! Is this what you do with Jeanette? Now, now. Come on, Jean, it is my last night of freedom. But Jeanette's my best friend. He's just no good. Well, he's your best friend! And I know him! He's a randy sod. Am I better than Jeanette? Oh, shut up! Oh! As best man, I'd just like to say... that knowing Jim as I have done for nearly 20 years now, I... I can only say that Jeanette is marrying a... a good, honest, reliable bloke and a best friend a man could ever wish for. To the bride and groom. And now... now, I'd like all of you to join me and drink a toast... to the lovely bridesmaids. Bridesmaids. It's not right, you know. Cos he's just not good enough for her. It should never have happened. She was always a good girl. I wish she'd never set eyes on him. ..Their own just yet. They'll be living with me for a little while. Until they get on their feet. But with her working at the hairdresser's, they should be able to afford something very nice quite soon. Where were you last night when I came round? Told her it was safe, I did. Though I didn't know for sure. Nor stop to consider now that it was legal... and we two were one. Funny to think, we'll soon be three. Or maybe four! £10 for the... You'll go for the £10? Splendid. You'll go for the £10. And question two. Windermere, Coniston, Ullswater are? Uh, Windermere, Coniston... Windermere and Coni...? Oh... - Lakes? - Lakes! Did you go after the job at Elliot's? £10, Terry! £10, Terry. Now, this makes you eligible, Terry, for our catch mystery question. We could do with a little less thinking and a bit more doing from you, young man. Will you take the mystery question, Terry? - Is that too tight, love? - No, that's fine. - Uh, £16, uh, £20! - I'll take the mystery question. - I'll be off to night school now. - Uh, £25, ten shillings. - I'll take the question. - £25, twelve and six. - I'll take the question. - You'll take the question! Excellent! Well, the mystery catch question and take care because this is a very difficult one.

Must be quite a handful for you, having a new baby in the house. Oh, no, he's as good as gold. Just like Jim was at that age. We don't know we're born with them, do we, Jeanette? Now, you're going to be a good boy for your Granny Sutcliffe, aren't you? Were you as good as gold, then? I hope you're not letting everybody run around after you all the time, Jeanette. You know, I never had a daughter of my own, but your Jeanette is just what I would have wanted. - Look at those eyes! - How's the van going? - Jeanette, can't you see Grandma Sutcliffe's? - It's not. Oh, that's a shame. I told Albert we should have bought a business, didn't I, Albert? It's not doing as well as it should. I always impressed on Terry the importance of qualifications. Terry wants to get engaged after his finals. So it looks as though we're going to be relations. Well, bugger me. Looks as though we're going to see quite a lot of each other. Shall I have him now? That will be nice, won't it? I'll keep him a bit longer. - You know... - He's not too heavy? - No. - Terry and you... you'll make a lovely couple. He's probably a bit of a hand. What was Jean on about this afternoon? What? Jean! This afternoon! Oh, nothing. Before we were married, did you ever... you know, take her out? Jean? Oh, come on! Did you, Jim? What, Jean? No. Never.

What the hell, boys? How's the group? Fantastic. Most of the boys you know left. Well, there's only me and Stuart that you'd know now. We're semi-pros. Yeah, we'll be professional as soon as we get a decent amplifier. We've got a recording session next week. Yeah, London Palladium the week after. It's good money then? Not bad. Twenty quid a week we got at Butlin's. Christ! You used to play the harmonica, didn't you? I saw a group last week. One of their blokes played an harmonica. He weren't bad.
