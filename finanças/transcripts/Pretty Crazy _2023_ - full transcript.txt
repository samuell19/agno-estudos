Really quick. Before dinner is served, I wanna take this time to just say thank you all for meeting with me. I know this business meeting has been a long time in the making, but I am confident that we are gonna have a bright future together. So on behalf of our company, it has been a pleasure working with you. No, really, the pleasure is all ours, Blake. During the negotiations, your team showed us what type of company we would be in business with. What I'm really trying to say here is that we are just glad to be in good hands. [laughing] Good hands. Better than Allstate. Okay? Okay, can we toast to that? Toast to--[chuckles] In good hands. Okay. Mmm. Mmm! Can't find one that's not crazy, man. [smacks lips] Shit stupid. Hi, Ma. Hey, baby, is that you? Ma, it's too early. Are you okay? Baby, it's only 10:03 in the morning. I was just calling to say hi and remind you that your best friend's wedding is coming up. You know, he called me early this morning and told me I didn't have to worry about coming to the wedding because he would send the car for me. Ain't that nice of him? God sure has his hands on that boy. And his girl? Oh, she is so cute. Speaking of, whatever happened to Kay-- Yeah. Kayleigh. And that's over with. Oh, what'd you say, baby? Over, Ma. She's out of her mind. Hmm. Well, I'm praying for you. By the way, when you're gonna start a family? It would be very nice to have a young lady. Don't you wanna? I wanna meet my special someone. But I can't just choose anybody. I got to take my time. I got to make sure they can handle my mama. Don't be using me. It'd be nice to have a daughter-in-law since you done stop braiding hair. Okay, so from now on, my first question is gonna be, "Can you braid hair?" Baby, you'd do that for me? That's why I love you, Ma. [phone ringing] Hold on, Ma. I gotta take this call. I'm gonna call you back. - All right, I love you. - I love you, too. - What up, fool? - Bro. You still don't have your tux yet? And you need to RSVP your plus-one.

Who does he think he is? He can't tell me what to do. I mean, you know what I'm tryin' to say, right? Jake. Blake. Anyway, he's always trying to control somebody. - It's like, "I'm on a date." - You are. Look, I'm not gonna be chasing your ass all over this city. Why you keep putting people in my business? Ain't nobody putting nobody in your business.

Did you see the girl-- You didn't see her. WOMAN: Blake? Thank you. Can I help you with something? Can you? WOMAN: Mel? [sighs] I'm used to fine women making the first move or doing the first line, so that's why-- I mean, it's okay. It's not gonna happen again. If it happens again. I just let the most beautiful girl walk out of my life. I can't be your best man. CLAYTON: What the hell are you talking about anyway? - I can't. - Look, Im'a help you out. There's a young lady that rents a space from me. Be perfect. No. Will ass had me on some blind dates with some terrible-ass women. So now you comparing me to Will hood ass. Look, she's a good one as far as I can tell. Let me give you her number. Okay. Okay. I'll be over there, but... this crazy shit is getting on my nerves, bruh. If she ain't like you say she is, I'm quitting your wedding and I'ma tell Tracy it was all your fault. Bye. - [smooth R&B playing] - Damn, cuz. You add some lyrics, I'm telling you, we be on. Some of the best shit I've made. Yeah, that's hot, cuz. "Yeah, that's hot, cuz." What? That's all you gonna say? I just told you this is some of the best shit I've ever made. [sighs] Damn. What-- Which one of these uppity chicken heads got you in your feelings now, cuz? Hey, but look, I can still call Jendra. Should I say Jenny? "If I fucks with you." Whatever this shit is, it's worse than... Okay, cuz, talk to me. [sighs] I bumped into this girl this morning. Beautiful. Just beautiful. Tried flirting with her. Nothing. She gave me this fake-ass smile and then left. [laughs] Why are you laughing? That's 'cause you lame, cuz. Okay. And you got soft. I've been telling you this. No, that's not it. She was different. She's...smoothed and she's genuine. A natural beauty. - Natural beauty? - Yes. Natural beauty, my ass, cuz. Once she take off them fake-ass lashes, that fake-ass hair and that casket-ready-ass makeup, you're gonna wake up to some natural boo! All right. I don't even know-- I don't know why I try with you. I really don't. But that's on me. I'm about to go into Clay's office. He has some girl he want me to meet. I don't know, but... By the way, your beats were dope. That's what I'm talking about. Good. I'll catch up with you. And look, tell bro good looking out letting me get these out the way. I got you. Yo, yo, yo. What up? What up? - What's going on? - How you feeling, bro? I'm feeling good. How about you? I'm straight. I didn't even think you were gonna show up. I thought you were gonna fake me out. Man, you got lucky with Tracy. I'm just here to see if you got some good taste. I did get lucky. I can't even argue with you on that one. - You did. - I got lucky. So let's hope that that luck rubs off on me. - So let's see. - We'll see. Let's go see. Come on. We'll see. Great job. BLAKE: Damn. It happened again. Excuse me. Um, I've been thinking about it for a while, and I know what you can help me with now. And what would that be? Allow me to take you out to lunch to make up for making a fool out of myself earlier. - Hmm. - Melanie, right? I heard them say your name at the coffee shop. Okay. So, after bumping into me "on accident" at the coffee shop, you decided to come to my job and stalk me? I wonder what would happen if I let you take me to lunch. Well, if I play my cards right, I won't have to stalk you. I'm Blake. I'm here to meet my buddy Clayton. Well, Blake, you have a nice smile. But I'm sure with a smile like that, you can take a lot of ladies to lunch. Smooth. Real smooth, bro. I see why you ain't got a date to my wedding. It's not high school. You got to put some work in for the real ones, bro. [chuckles] You sad, man. You sad. [sighs] Clayton is right. High school was such a breeze. Like, being a star football player, it had its benefits. I would just walk into a room and women flocked to me. And seeing that I was playing football and the student body president in college, I didn't have no problem there either. But in college, the women were, um-- They were pretty crazy. It was--It was weird. Um, but this one, she, uh-- she got my attention. [students chanting] So, big-time account executive. I guess you don't need protection anymore for yourself. I guess the biggest thing is bowing at the copier machine. As long as I know number seven, I'm gonna be all right. Looks like these guys don't need number seven. And I see you still keeping tabs on your old students, huh? I always keep in touch with all my students, especially ones that date crazy women. Um, for a lack of a better word. Yeah. Quasinum, I've done some insurance since I've been gone, and believe it or not, I think I'm done with crazy. I just can't seem to stop attracting them. Son, I've been doing this a long time. Martial arts is like life. And that's what I teach-- life skills. And in order for you to move forward and to get away from crazy, you have to sometimes look at the reflection in the mirror. You may not like what you see. Quasinum, you always got some deep knowledge to share. It's probably why I made it through college. - That's why you owe me. - Of course. Next round. - I got you. - For real this time. I got you. I got you. All right. That's what they all say. Well, I mean that, though. It's not gonna happen tomorrow. [phone chimes] CLAYTON: Yo, I told you Mel was nice, bro. She ain't crazy like the other ones. You think you can handle that? I've been thinking about it, and, yes, she is nice. I--I'm so ready to leave crazy behind, man. Yeah, and you got to be tired making sure ain't nobody left no panties behind. You are right about that. I should probably double-check when I get home. Check all the drawers. Check under the bed, too. They sneaky like that. Yeah, you got to get right so I can find Mrs. Right. Keep saying corny shit like that, only thing you're gonna get is Ms. Wrong. Okay, Now that you got her attention, what you gonna do? I can't keep holding your hand, bro. Okay, Mr. Lucky, take it easy. I just gotta... think outside the box. [chuckles] All right.

You're stalking me, or is it somebody else? - Excuse me? - Yeah. I got that letter that you left on my car. It's very cute, but it was addressed to a "Maloney." My stalking skills are a little lame, but I didn't think hiding behind a bush and speaking through it was, like, your speed, so... - Okay. - But my spelling is on point. - That letter was for you. - Hmm. It must have got wet or something. Just on the "A." Yeah, it'd be raining and one spot out here is crazy. Okay. It's a little too late for lunch, so how about I take you to get a smoothie? It's a joint a couple of blocks down. - What happened to lunch? - You blew that. Actually, you gotta work your way back to that. Oh, that's crazy, because I was gonna say the same for you. - And that is? - You haven't really worked your way up to a smoothie. - Oh. Is that right? - Mm-hmm. - You didn't clean it? - Mm-hmm. I can't tell, 'cause it's, like, everywhere. You wanna fix that. That's not really smoothie worthy either, you know. Hello, everyone. Ms. Melanie. Can I borrow the gym really quickly? Sure. You guys, we can finish this up later. Go ahead and follow our guest over here, see what he has to say. Okay, now, my name is Mr. Adams, and I am friends with Ms. Melanie. Who here knows how to tie one of these? Okay, everybody. That's cool. So, I know most times we wear casual clothes, but a time is gonna come where you have a job interview and you got to wear a shirt and tie. So that's what this is for. Now, first thing, you got to make a selection. I chose this 'cause I like the design. My favorite color is blue. So I'm gonna tie it first just to show you. And then after that, we'll all go through it step by step. How about that smoothie now? Ms. Mel, I think your friend likes you. What are you talking about? I see him smiling at you and you smiling, too. That was a slick move you pulled-- using my kids like that against me. Yeah, it was. But I think helping out the young men is important. You know, teaching them how to tie a tie or carry themselves as a gentleman. So it wasn't an act. No, it was, but... I see what is important to you, and I want to be a part of that. So, Blake, what does this big account executive do in his free time when he's not stalking innocent girls like me? And why don't you have anybody else to stalk? I don't know what a big-time account executive does, but I like to keep things simple. I hang out with my cousin and my buddy Clayton whom you know. I love my mom, but not the annoying mama's boy kind of love. And as far as girls go, I've had my share of dating. Seems like I can't choose the right one. They're all... unique, pretty crazy. But yeah, I like to be simple, like a walk and a smoothie. What about you? I'm sure you got somebody, what did you say, stalking you? Hmm. Well, right now it's just me and the kids. But, I mean, it's not like they ain't trying because-- [Blake laughs] You know. No, but seriously, um, I just--I like to keep it simple, too. You know, I just-- I guess I'm waiting to meet the right person. Is that right? Hold on for one second. - Thank you so much. - Not a problem. Oh! So, you think just because you bought me this strawberry banana smoothie and just 'cause you helped her all gentlemanly like that you could just hold my hand? As much money as I paid her to show up on time at that exact moment, yes. Are you always like this? Um, maybe. We could talk about it after my next strawberry banana smoothie. Ooh. A Mexican what? You've never had Mexican corn before? I've had corn. Is that a trick question? Dude, what? You've never tried this? Okay, hold on. You have to try it. It's gonna change your life, I promise. What's in it that makes a girl like you get all giddy inside? I don't know. Some corn, some mayonnaise, some cheesy stuff, and red stuff. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Nice. Nice. I like what I see. That must be the wine talking. Mm. Yeah, it was the wine talking. Never mind. Okay. Was that the wine talking? What do we have here? Okay, so, this could be the wine talking, but hear me out. This is us on vacation on the Virgin Islands, if you act right. Now, over here, we're laying down on the beach under an umbrella. Over here, we got a boat going past with people waving at us. Butt-ass naked. - Is that right? - That's right. - I see a sky. - Okay, well, obviously. A sun. Random person tanning. - That's actually a towel. - Another tanning bed. That's another towel. - Sun. - Okay, we're critiquing. You took one sip. What are we doing over here? It's a heart. With some glasses, because I enjoy glasses. - That doesn't make sense. - Okay. That looks better. Okay. - Actually-- - Ten times better. No, it doesn't. Okay. And now that's not a beach anymore. It's a wart. [chattering] See, 'cause if I would've let you step in that, you'd have been looking stupid. Had gum all on your shoe. Ms. Mell, Mr. Adams has been coming here a lot lately. And when he's here, you sure do smile a lot. Is he your boyfriend? Young lady, what do you know about having a boyfriend? I know if he's always making you smile and helping you out, he's your boyfriend. And every time he's around, you smile. That's not all there is to having a boyfriend. But smiling does help a lot. Plus, don't be worrying about that. You need to be worrying about this. [phone chimes] Okay. Just so you know, my mom says some off-the-wall stuff sometimes, so just a heads-up. Ooh, I'm so scared. Don't worry. I think I can handle myself. Okay, Ms. Badass. Hey, baby. Hello, Ma. Mmm. - How you doing? - Good. Who this little ugly girl you done bought to my house? Wow, Ma. Um, this is Melanie. Mel, this is my mama. Hi, Mrs. Adams. It's really nice to meet you. Blake has told me so much about you, but he didn't say how beautiful you were. Okay, you can tell me. Well, Mrs. Adams, you are very beautiful, and I love what you've done with your hair. Hmm. I like her. Mel, would you like something to drink? You got to try my mom's homemade lemonade. It's the reason I keep coming over here. Mama, I'm gonna go upstairs and grab some shirts and ties I used to wear to church. I'm gonna be helping Mel out with her kids. Did I hear that right? You have children? None of my own, ma'am. No, no, no, no, no. I work at the gym with the kids, and Blake's been helping out a lot. They really like him. You know, he's very patient. He listens. He engages with the kids. And most of all, when he's working with them one on one, he makes it feel like it's just you. I'm really lucky to have him in my--the kids' life. Hmm. You sure you're just talking about the kids? I haven't seen you in a minute, bro. I know somebody got your nose wide open. Yeah, I got to give you credit on this one, Clay. Your girl Mel has your boy working hard just to get to first base. I tried to tell you, bro. I know a good one when I see it. She way different from, uh... [smacks lips] What's her name? The first one. Oh, Keisha, man. First one. Yes. Now that I think about it, she's probably the reason I am the way I am. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What was it she had you do again? Cover her ass in whipped cream and then spank it with a yellow fly swatter. It's not funny actually. But whatever. That's probably why I miss the crazy-ass woman now. First time out, and that's the shit I get. And it seems like every time the next one wants to be crazier than the last one. And I don't get that. But I can't lie. Sometimes it is somewhat interesting. I mean, bruh, that shit still make me laugh. It couldn't be a green fly swatter, blue one. I mean, it had to be yellow? Man, yes. Yellow fly swatter. I mean, it was kind of weird, but I was like, what the hell? But hold on, bruh, 'cause you acting like I'm the only one that's had his share of crazy. I know you ain't talking about the twins, man. Exactly what I'm talking about. [blowing lips] My first bout and I get hit with a double dose. Two for one. That's right. Damn. [doorbell rings] Hey, Tammy, are you ready? Um... - Where's your boy? - I didn't... I told you I'm a twin, right? Yeah, I believe you saying something like that. So why would you think I would go somewhere with you without my twin? Uh, I... I told you, Sis. They all think I'm ugly. Look at me. Am I beautiful? Yes, you are. And you look like me, right? Yes, I do. So that would make you beautiful. Yes, it would. - You know what? - What? - Why don't you go out? - You sure about that? Yes, Sis. You know I love you. Okay. So... Where's your boy? I told you I was a twin, right? You didn't think I was gonna go on a date with you without my twin, did you? Told you. They think I'm ugly. You are not ugly. Look at me. What do you see? I left my wallet at my mom's house. Your wallet at your mama house. So, you didn't think about your wallet before you went into the forest? That lumberjack-ass jacket. Bro. The twins? They was--They was cool. I just couldn't do it. Yeah, but to be honest with you, Clay, I think I was into that type of crazy woman because there was no commitment. Like, when they got crazy, I would just leave, and that'd be that. And there was no feelings attached. And if it was feelings, I'd just move on to the next one. Right. But with Mel, we don't do crazy shit. We do fun shit. Like, she's the first girl I've--I would say good night to, and then the next time I wake up, I cannot wait to see her, bro. Like... I think it's time to leave crazy alone, man. Yes, I know. Yeah, she got your nose wide open. Oh, my God. What's up with, um... with your girl Kayleigh? Oh, that's done with. I'm done with her crazy ass. She cool with that? I know she could be, you know, jealous. Yeah, I guess, dog. I mean, she called me a few times, but I left it on voicemail. Like, just over with. [blowing lips] Speaking of crazy, the bachelor party. Oh. Don't even worry about it. Got it all settled. I don't need your-soon-to-be wife being mad at me. Got a bachelor party. No strippers. Boo. Just this party celebrating my bro. Okay, If it's like that, we ain't hanging out no more. Okay, I got... I don't know what I'm gonna do with you, girl. You done got you a new man. I can't get a call, a text, or something. Ain't seen you in a couple of weeks. This must be the one. I can't lie, Tiff. It's been real chill. We've been doing some normal shit, girl. - And I even met his mom. - Hold up. Met his mom? Like, met his mom or like that last loser? Okay, you ain't have to bring that up. And it seems like I did meet her, seeing as how he had to call her before and after we had sex. Girl, you done had some fine men, but damn, they were all crazy. This one seems like one of the sane ones. So you're telling me Ryan, who was fine, but had both of his German shepherds stuffed and set up at the foot of his bed is above mama's boy? Girl, when I saw that, I was like, "I got to go. I got some socks to fold." Wait. What about the brother that kept forgetting his wallet every time you guys went out? Oh, my God. He wasn't crazy. He was just cheap. True. It's about time, girl. You deserve this. Thank you. And it feels so good. Cheers. We're getting down to the day, babe. Are all the groomsmen fitted and ready to go? Especially the best man? Does he even know who he's bringing? Everybody is good, baby. Blake is, too. He said he done with crazy. You know my friend Melanie from the gym? Mm-hmm. I think he got his eyes on her. I think she just might be the one to slow him down. All right, now. Look, I don't want no problems. I do not need his behind running up behind my bridesmaids or Aunt Bunny. Come on now. We both know your Aunt Bunny will be the one hitting on him. You know she a cougar. Plus, I told you, he done with crazy. So you're trying to call Aunt Bunny crazy? I'm just saying. So, what about you? Are you done with crazy? Because, you know, I heard they run in packs. I can hold on to this crazy for a little while. So, I see that you guys agree with the plans. Ah! What are you doing here? I've been calling you, but I guess your phone is off. So I remember you work out at this time. It's not off. You're blocked. Anyway, I was calling to tell you that you left your watch at my house, and I know you left it on purpose so that you could come and see me. So I... engraved something special on the back for you. Why would... You can keep it. When are you gonna come get it? Bye, Kayleigh. [Kayleigh smacks lips] Okay, baby, see you later! This is what I'm talking about. Out having a good time. Drinking. Eye candy. No thanks to your best man. See, I took the liberty of inviting some of my own friends, 'cause my cousin is a lame. I ain't wanted to take the chance on him bringing some of them uppity chicks, you know. Shut up, man. Clayton is not trying to take part in your shenanigans. What the fuck does that even mean? See what I'm talking about, Clay? Lame as hell. You know what? If you gentlemen would excuse me, I'm about to make sure that people get their party on. Do that because that's, like, why you're here, so... Please stop me. - Damn. Look at short-- - Yeah. Shorty right there. Oh, my God. Yeah. That's why I had this party in advance. You can take it in and have time to recover. [sighs] Let's stroll. You enjoy yourself. In order to keep my sanity, I'm gonna call my soon-to-be, man. - Okay. - Have fun. Excuse me. You Blake, right? I--Uh, yeah. Jendra. Yes. Jenny. [together] If I fucks with you. - Right. Right. - Fucks with you. I remember. Yes. I bet you thought you were never gonna see me again. - I was hoping. - Wow. Really? Me, too. Um, about last time, something had happened and, um... Mama got sick. But if you ever wanna go out for scrimps again, we should go. They was fire. We should. Yeah. It was so good. I'm gonna put it in my calendar right now. I got to take this phone call, but I'll be right back. - Okay. - Be right back. I'll be right here, boo. Okay. Tell me you had nothing to do with that. Man, she said she's looking for Blake and wanna thank him for some scrimps here, boy. I said to myself, "Self, this is gonna be good. That's him right there." When she said scrimps, you should have known better. - That's why I did it. - I can't stand your ass, man. What's going on? I thought you had shows. What you doing in town? Man, you know I had to come show Clay some love. Give him his last laugh before he jumps the broom. Once they get the hooks in you, ain't nothing funny no more. Yeah, I see you're still on your "live, laugh, love" shit. Yeah, it works for me. You got something better? I think Clay got it right this time. And if everything goes right, I'm gonna be right behind him. But listen, I ain't gonna stand in your way, but the next time you need to laugh, let me know. I'll get some tickets for my show. I appreciate that. You spoke to Clay already? Yeah. I saw him outside. - How long you in town? - I'm here to the morning. But if you're not gonna be messing with strip girls, I think I'm gonna do a little night fishing. - Enjoy yourself. - All right, bro. Nasty ass. How's it going? I appreciate you, man, letting me deejay at the wedding. Sure. You know you good with me, Will. It wasn't even a question, bro. So, man. Hey, but look, though. This here's a party. They fucking with me. Moms won't let me test one of these joints I've been working on. - Go ahead. - Appreciate you, man. Don't have me looking bad out there, bro. You are a hater. Trust me. You can live all by yourself. What did you say? What did he say? Okay. Nobody hear me. Okay. That's what's up. [R&B beat playing] These sounds so good. Who made these beats? It's all me, baby.

Okay, Blake, who is this? - The job that I had-- - Oh, so he didn't tell-- - This is my boo. - Mel, I ain't her shit. Okay? I left that her house when I broke up with her, and she did that after we split up. And as you can see, this is exactly why we're not together. Kayleigh, this is not happening. Please leave. I'll leave, 'cause obviously you two have some things to work out. Mel. Mel. Just wait. Come on, boo-boo, before they give our tab-- Mel. I know. It's not what it looks like. Looks like something I don't wanna be a part of. Baby, baby, I would not do this to you. What are you doing? Don't call-- Mel, listen, listen. Don't call a Uber. Why would I invest all of my time into you, wasting your time, if I had somebody else in my life? It's not what you think. Baby-- You don't know what I think, and I don't know what to think. Baby. Mel. Mel! Damn, Kayleigh! Valet! Fuck. What are you doing? Baby, I'll make up to you when we get home. I'll make this one extra special for you. Come upstairs. You know I can't stay mad at you. I forgive you, baby. I'll make you forget all about her. She doesn't make you feel the way I do. You're absolutely right. She doesn't make me feel the way that you do, the way Melanie does. Kayleigh, this is all my fault. I shouldn't have let this relationship go on for as long as it has. I knew I wasn't gonna commit to you when I met you, and that's wrong. You deserve somebody that's gonna be there for you through the good and through the bad. And I'm not that guy. I'm sorry. You don't mean that. Just come upstair-- It's over, Kayleigh. [door closes] Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice messaging system. Hey, it's Mel. Leave a message, but keep it short. Mel, this has been the best three weeks of my life. I would really hate to lose you over a misunderstanding like that. That was one of the dates I was telling you about where I can't just have a smoothie and a walk. Thank you. Your message has been sent. [soft R&B playing] ♪♪♪ Mel. Baby, I wish you would let me explain. That girl means nothing to me. I'm glad she showed up. Because it lets me know that I would have made a terrible decision by letting a woman like that ruin my life. Before you, Mel, all my days are a blur. I--I don't even try to remember them. With you, I can't sleep knowing how much fun we have and what more we have to come. Just walking down the street and holding hands with you makes me smile. When I look at Clayton, I didn't think-- I didn't think I would find someone like that to love. But you changed that. Mel. I love you. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ I just did that. I snuck into her building, stood at her door, and poured out my heart. Am I ashamed of it? Sort of. But... I mean, I'm also proud at the same time. Whoever said love hurts? Man. You look pretty bad, bro. Have you had any sleep these past couple of days? No, man, I can't. I tried calling Mel, but she's not answering her phone. I tried sneaking in her building to catch her, but nothing. You was crying at the door? Don't answer that. My bad, bro. I hate to see you like that. I'll just tell Tracy to push the wedding back. You not gonna tell her shit like that. I don't need her coming in my head. I'ma be okay for the wedding, bruh. Thank God. And if she came for you, ain't no telling what she was gonna do to me. All I got to say is, crazy ain't never had me feeling like this. It ain't crazy, bro. It's just love. Yeah. Let me see. Man, Mr. B., I can't get the hang of tying this thing. You got it. You got it. Just a little more practice, that's all. You wanna be ready for your job interview, don't you? Yeah. I need to get paid. What's up with you and Ms. Melanie? Both of y'all walking around looking all frowned up? Have you seen Ms. Melanie? Nah, we ain't seen her. Okay. Why did you say we haven't seen her? That's what she told me to say if he asked. Well, she needs to see him. She hasn't been smiling since he hasn't been coming around. Here, baby. Thank you for the pie, Ma. You always know how to brighten my day. The way you looking, it's gonna take more than my pie to brighten your day. Melanie, right? Ma, she was so special. Hmm. Baby, you thought love was gonna be easy? If it was easy, everybody be doing it. When your dad and I was dating, he did something so simple, and I made a big deal out of it. All right, babe, I'm gonna run to the house real quick, grab some clothes for tomorrow. I'll be right back. When I do, we can work on that movie we was talking about. But, um, I got to stop by old girl house. The one I can't really say a name in here. I'm just dropping off some treats and some toys. Why you got to do all that? Why she can't by him some new stuff? Look, I already told you, when we broke up, she kept the dog. And I'm just trying to drop off some of his favorite toys. He can get some new stuff, and he gonna be just fine. Look, I told you, it's not a big deal. And when--Don't be like that. When I get back, we can work on that movie. All right? Don't trip. I didn't answer his calls for two weeks. You know, he kept calling and I kept ignoring. I know it wasn't right at the time, but I just want to make sure that I was the one for him. And you know what? After two weeks, he was still calling, so I knew I was the one. Why would you do that if you knew you wanted to be with him? Because love make you do crazy things. I never asked, but, um, what happened? Well, unfortunately, your dad, he never got over me leaving him those two weeks. We never talked about it. We never discussed it. And he just became really insecure. You know, every time I left the house, he would question where I was going. It got to the point where I was like, "Are you gonna ever get over this?" And he told me he didn't know. And then he got up, kissed me on my cheek, went upstairs and packed a bag, came down and left the house. Two months later, divorce papers came. I remember that. You sat in the middle of the floor with the papers in front of you, crying your eyes out. I could almost hear your heart break. I never knew what happened, but as I sat on the floor next to you, wiping your eyes, all I thought about was never wanting to feel like what you were going through. You know, after your dad got sick and I would go visit him, he told me that he was sorry. He knew I wasn't seeing anyone, and his pride just wouldn't let him come back. And I told him I was sorry, too, but my pride wouldn't let me call him. I just don't wanna end up sitting in the middle of the floor, crying. That's the thing about love, Son. You're gonna end up crying somewhere. But if you're in it together, you'll be able to wipe away each other's tears. Commitment and pride. Those are two of the things that mess up a relationship. You don't wanna end up like me and your dad, Son. I think I'm way past pride, Ma. I think it's a story behind that one. - [R&B playing] - Crazy. [phone buzzing] Yo, what up? You outside? All right. I'm coming now. All right. [clears throat] What's up? Oh, man. What's up, man? [music stops] You still ain't over shorty yet, are you? You still ain't over shorty, huh? You're crazy. Bro. Yo, Will, let me hit one of your blunts. Nigga, have you lost your mind? You don't even smoke weed. I get it. You think you about to waste my shit 'cause you in your feelings? Hell, no. No. No. Not today. Don't even know why you asked that. You trippin'. You right, though, cuz. Like, I'm not myself. - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Like, as soon as I think I get rid of it, crazy finds a way back into my life. Mm. Mm. Okay. Look, I hate to break this down to you, cuz. See, it's different levels with crazy. You always fucking with that high-level crazy. But see, you don't even know about the low-level crazy. See-- See, with the high-level crazy, you can't really do shit about. But the low-level crazy, there's always something behind it. It's up to you to find it. But when you do, it's a higher chance you can fix it. Uh... - It's like the weed talking. - I know it was. I understand that. I don't even know why you looking at it like that, 'cause I'm not finna let you hit this shit. Why you mad? Look, I'll tell you what, though. Get at me after the wedding, I might hook you up. 'Cause you know I always got it. Hmm? She just came out of nowhere talking about some, "I'll take it from here. This is my boo." Who even calls a grown man boo anymore? Then she's gonna take out this watch with a heart and "forever" engraved on the back of it, talking about some, he left it at her apartment. So, what did Blake say? You did ask him, didn't you? He said that he broke up with her and that he left that watch in her apartment and her crazy ass had it engraved. He tried to explain, but I just left. Mel, from everything you had said about him, why didn't you hear him out? Because it was just like standing there was giving me déjà vu. - Do you remember Paul? - How could I forget? Dude tried to make you check in every two hours and try to turn you into a vegetarian. You know you like you some bacon. Yeah, and leaving his ass was nothing nice either. That's why the man calling my cousin Mimi and have a talk with him. - That finally worked. - That's the thing though, Tiff. I wanna be done with crazy. Um, it seems like Blake does too. Look, girl, you got to stop letting your past boyfriends control your life. Not all men are gonna be like them. If you never let them remain in the past, you'll never have a future. And you'll never be able to let someone treat you the way you should be treated. Treat you the way you should be treated. And it's about time. Let yourself be treated nice for once. I guess you're right. Thanks for always having my back, Tiff. You know I got your back, girl. - Hey, girl. - Hey, Ms. Lena. You had yourself a visitor. Were you peeking again? I wasn't peeping. I was listening. It sounded like that young fella you've been spending your time with. Girl, he was begging, crying, and pleading. If some music was playing, I swear it was Keith Sweat. Girl, he must have thought you was home 'cause he was going hard. He might still have left some tears on your door. I can't tell you what all he said, but I can tell you this-- that man really loves you. Now, if you not sure why this man is sneaking in your building and crying where everybody can hear him and not care, I will go in there and give him a call and do that texting thing y'all do and let him know you're still around. Girl, don't you let that beggin'-ass man get away. And, oh, he left you something at your door. I ain't want it to go missing. You know how people are. - Thank you. Ms. Lena. - Mm-hmm. - May I help you? - Yeah. Uh... Yeah. Let me get the, uh, number seven. - Do you want a drink with that? - Is that extra? Yes. Nah. Let me just--I'm gonna go with the number seven. That will be, uh, $10.89. $10.89? You might as well just say $11.00. Do you want it or not? Yeah. Yeah. How much you say that was? $10.89, sir. [buzzing] How much you short, bro? I'm like, uh... It's cool. Um, here you go. Appreciate you, bro. Appreciate you, bro. That's love, bro. Black on black love. - Yeah. - Appreciate you. Get yourself a juice, too. And keep the change. - Can I get a drink, too? - What flavor? Purple. Purple ain't no damn flavor. It's grape. Let me get a chocolate donut, too. MAN: Next. BLAKE: Oh. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't see you standing right there. That's okay. It's just a little hot coffee. You know, uh, just imagine if that was a hot wax. Uh... Oh, no. Um... I have a question. This...

I wish you would have, but you couldn't 'cause she got into your car. She did. I took her home. But it wasn't until you drove off that I realized it wasn't Kayleigh's fault. I would just leave when she would do the jealous thing. I wouldn't say anything. I'd just go. But I wanted to say something this time. When I let her out in front of her apartment, I told her that I wanna be with you. I didn't want there to be any misunderstandings. I wasn't unhappy, Blake. I was scared. That thing that happened, that was a flashback of a relationship that I've already been in. I know what it's like to be with someone who's super possessive. I don't wanna invest my feelings into this, and you still have to deal with that. But, baby, that's on me. I should have said and did more when you walked away. But to be honest, I was scared too. For the first time, when I'm with you, I don't wanna just leave anymore. I could be doing absolutely nothing with you and feel the love surrounding me. And the only thing I'm left to deal with and the only thing that I wanna deal with is that I'm in love with you. I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
