EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH There you are, Jean-Philippe. This is your new home. EcoCleanPro. How can I help you? You ordered rags and you received... floor cloths? Ah, you mean, mops! The thing you attach to the handle. I just got here. I have to go. It looks like it hasn't changed much. Not sure they've got Wi-Fi. All right, I'll have a load of 70 delivered to you. Yes. - Hello. - You too. Bye. Oh, Mélody! I'll be your internship supervisor. I'm an accounting intern. Aren't you a paralegal? - I'm multifunctional here. - All right. - My mother says hi. - So sweet of her. We miss her. Which reminds me, I have to order toilet paper. Your timing is perfect: the representative for cleaning products BtoB sales in Benelux is coming in today. Anna Nilsson. You're going to love her. Didn't she get all the cleaning ladies fired to "save" money? She did. Indeed. - Good morning. - Hello. - Jean-Paul, Jean-Pierre. - Inès. - This is Mélody, our new intern. - Right, Mariam's daughter. We miss her. Jean-Pierre is our control manager and Jean-Paul, our logistics manager. I worked a bit late last night but I managed to finish it. Actually, it turns out I won't need it. Oh? - Really? - Sorry. Well... I'll just... At least I'm up to date about ISO 9000 standards. See you later, alligator! It used to be my office. Patrick preferred to keep me close by. You're lucky you landed an internship at EcoClean. I went through this with Chloé and it's hard to find. No, it's all there, yes. Okay, let's do that. I'll see you this afternoon. - Hello. - Hello! Is your neck okay? - Ouch! - Oops. I'm Mélody, the intern. Right! Mariam's daughter. - Could you sign my contract? - Of course. That's a good school. Claude De Groot is a teacher there, isn't he? A very nice guy. But he can't play golf for shit. He sucks! He sucks. Thanks. Welcome to EcoCleanPro, the cleaning pros! Would you mind making me another coffee? Great. Your first mission is to shred all of these. It's urgent. No, no. Don't bother reading them. It's too complex. You wouldn't understand anyway. These look like regular VAT reports. You shred them. As for the rest, you check with Inès. You know each other, don't you? - For so long! - Not much. Thank you. Nilsson's almost here. General meeting! Annual review! Hello! I'm so glad to meet with you all again this year. I'm also glad because once again, this year... Exxogroup is committed to a project of trust and innovation, with all of their partners, to serve the creation of value. So-- Sorry. So what is it all about? Well... It means that each and every one of you can be their own manager in a collaborative but also offensive and disruptive way, thanks to concrete actions, by optimizing efficient leadership that allows each and every one of you to represent your employer's brand. Surely, this is quite obvious. - Now... - Is there any coffee left? Let's get on with this because I know what you're thinking. What about the brand? What about it? Well... All of this makes perfect sense. With renewed efforts, we'll manage to reach our financial goals and preserve the stability of our shareholders. How? Through strategic budget sobriety and a vision of expertise and pricing excellence. It will be much clearer to you when you see this. So now, it doesn't mean we can't keep an overview of corporate culture on environmental issues. Patrick! - Are you skeptical? - Climate-skeptical. Good, very good. Humor is a good thing. Then, let's move on to income according to human capital. So here, we're talking about gender equality. An issue which is the core of Exxogroup's communication mission. As this graph shows, you are the worst Exxogroup branch in that regard. You are. There. Any questions? None. Back to work. - Patrick, can we have a word? - Of course, in my office. Inès, are you okay? Are you having a stroke? See the pink line there? It's me. - I was wondering... - Yeah? - Between us women... - Yeah? My daughter often says I should stand up for myself, but, you know, it's not easy. - So what's the plan? - For? For equal pay. It's Patrick you should talk to. You get along well, don't you? I'm off. - Inès... - Hello, Tom. We're out of TP. The cleaning ladies are gone, so it's up to us. Tom, wait! Did you fix the storeroom door? A chick giving orders... Is she for real? And a lovely day to you too. Inès? Inès! Inès! - Inès? - Yeah? We're out of paper. Out of toilet paper. EcoCleanPro. How can I help you? Shit! I think I'll ask for a SUV this year. On top of your raise? It worked for Nico last year, right? You're right. I'll ask, too. Time for personal reviews! I'll blow his mind so bad, he'll get a headache. Come in, my boy. WHY I SHOULD GET A RAISE "With a total of two half-days of sick leave over 52 quarters... I consider that I deserve a raise." Listen, I didn't want to embarrass you in front of Nilsson, but your coffee tasted like shit again. If you don't like it, you can... Do it... I don't care. I don't like coffee anyway. Besides my work here as a paralegal, I'm in charge of customer service, secretarial duties, quality control and human resources. "...customer service, secretarial duties, quality control, and human resources. And I only took two half-days off over the 17 years I've been working here." You don't have to convince me of your many skills, Inès. If you didn't exist, we ought to create you! - Everyone else is getting a raise. - If it were up to me, you'd be designated employee of the month every month. But there's a recession. - Anna Nilsson said that equal pay... - For sure. We'll do everything in our power to make it happen. Starting next year. And, between you and me, that's what they say, indeed. But they don't send any extra budget for it. Nothing, zero, squat! - Nothing. - Yep. What about the seniority bonus? Shouldn't I get it? Listen, Inès. You know I'd do anything to help you. I wasn't elected manager of the year for no reason. In 1992. But right now, there's nothing I can do. Sorry. With time and patience, mulberry leaves turn into silk robes. Sorry, it's important. We're done here, aren't we? Yes, honey, I'm listening. The plumber? No, pay him off the books. Of course, not. Do I look like someone who pays VAT? Sorry. Ouch. Mélody, can I have one of your sedatives? - They're strong. - You know, at this point... Thanks. Everything will be fine. Time to move up a gear, don't you think? You're shredding three sheets a minute. At this pace, for 180 sheets, it will take you... 180 times 3,000 an hour... It will take you 16 hours. We sell cleaning products, so everything here has to be perfect. For your desk, you can use the grapefruit multi-surface cleaner. Not the anti-static microfibers. They're for computer screens. You represent EcoClean here, so you need to be cheerful and dynamic. It's important if you want to have a career. Have a career? At EcoClean? Have a career! Okay, I get it. You were pretty hot back then. What happened? - Didn't you like the little apron, boss? - Yes, definitely. Well... see you later. With Mélody here, maybe I can eat out with you this year. Oh, no. No, I'd rather have you stay here. We need someone we can trust to hold the fort. I've never had sushi. You're not missing out on anything. Japanese food can be "sushit". See you, girls. I'll get you a coconut ball. Jean-Philippe? I don't feel so good. EcoCleanClo. How can I help you? I'm calling about my cloths. - Please give me the purchase... - Order number? or... order number. - 4818. - Ah? - Really? - I still haven't received them. That's too bad. - What do you mean, "too bad"? - Yep. - Have a good night, then. Well, no... - Are you kidding me? - Have a nice day. - Sure. This place is a nightmare. They're all morons. I won't survive a whole month. I don't care if I don't graduate. Come on, Mélody. You know you were lucky Patrick took you in. - Mom, come on. - I know what I'm talking about. - Thank you for waiting. - I have to go, bye. To stay on the line, press 3. Do you want some coffee? No, it makes your teeth yellow. I need something stronger. An energizer. None of our associates are currently available. We'll answer your call as soon as possible. - What is it? - Viagra. Want one? No, thanks. I don't drink alcohol. All righty. Hello? Hello? Dirk Penningen, speaking. Hello? Hey, this is Inès Thingy, paralegal here at EcoCleanPro. I've read the contract about those vacuum cleaners and you should be ashamed! - But you said-- - Put your supervisor on the phone. - Mr. Deslechte is not available. - I don't want to hear it! Okay, please hold. - It was delicious. - Those coconut balls... - Food coma on its way. - Let's grab another coffee. - Patrick? - Yes? - Can we talk? - No, we can't! I've got work to do. Patrick. I, too, deserve a raise. Now is not the time. You've been saying that for 17 years. Oh, here. I got you a coconut ball. There you go. They all get a raise every year and I don't. It's not right. Come on, Inès. Have a seat, now. Come on... Would you please relax? There. Okay? Inès. Let's get things straight. When I hired you after your divorce, you didn't have a degree. No degree whatsoever, no work experience. Zero. Nothing. You had a kid! - Yes, but-- - I just wanted to help you out. I didn't graduate because Chloé was born too soon, but I'm still a paralegal. Paid as a secretary, treated as a-- Many people would dream of having your position. Mélody, for example. Would she want to work five jobs for half the pay? Come on now. You and me, we're like yin and yang. We complete each other. Let's not get upset over money issues, okay? - It is so unfair. - Hush now. Fair, unfair... Ah, there it is. You're much prettier when you smile. It's true, we haven't spent time together for a while. - Not since the Christmas party. - Right. You're right: you deserve much more than a coconut ball. What were you thinking? - You needed help! - Well, thank you very much. If you want to help me, call an ambulance. An ambulance? It's a bit late now. Look at him! Don't worry, he's okay. He's always clumsy when he's drunk. - He's often like that after eating out. - Dead? What's the emergency number? - They'll call the police. - So what? Without a witness and a good lawyer, we'll never make it. - We didn't do anything. He just fell. - Who will believe that? - We'll plead self-defense. - "We"? - I have nothing to do with this. - You pushed him. I got here this morning. I don't know the guy! Whereas you've got 17 years of motives. I've never run a red light in my life, let alone killed anyone. - Help me. - It's going to be okay, Patrick. Come on. He stopped breathing. It's a crime. I'm a criminal. EcoCleanPro. How can I help you? The police? Already? He's not here. Really. - What the hell? - It's Financial Crimes. You have a good day, too, madam detective. Good bye. Don't worry, Inès will fix this. Let's fix this. - Will you give me a hand? - You won't call the police? Of course not. Come on. - Where do we put him? - Under the desk. - He won't fit. - Yes, he will. One, two, three. Go get some rags and the MagiClean. Do you want me to call the cops? I can't find it! The pink box! The pink one over there. Thanks. I've known him 20 years. And I killed him. And now I'm disposing of him. Quick, quick, quick. Hey, girls! Did you undress for me, Inès? It's hot in here. You getting hot flashes? That's it. Menopause has started. - Don't be embarrassed. - I'm working, Nico. I know how long he takes. We've got six minutes. Come on! Lime and bergamot. I'll never get tired of it. - Tea? Now? Are you serious? - It's for cleaning! Blood comes off with cold water. Otherwise you'll bake the stain. Tonight, I'll put the body in the trunk of my car and I'll drop him in the canal, all right? It's not perfect but, you know... I guess I can forget about that raise. I assure you, it's good stuff. The best ever. My advice is, go with the ExtraPlus line. It's a bit more expensive but the difference is totally worth it. All right, it's a deal. Let's go with Extra. Okay, bye. I feel terrible. Shall we call the police? I'm onto something big with a retirement home. Congratulations. They'll charge us with murder and we'll go to jail. They're all incontinent over there. This jackpot will make my year. You're right. We'll handle it ourselves. I don't want to end up in jail. What are you chatting about? - Me? - You wouldn't be interested. - Shopping? - Exactly. Ah, women! So mysterious, yet so predictable. They don't change. Detective Van Duyne, Financial Crimes. I called earlier. Patrick Steiner? I'll take care of it. He's not here. In his absence, I'm in charge here. I'm Nicolas Wouters. Nice to meet you. No! No, no! His office hasn't been cleaned. How about the meeting room? Don't be neurotic, Inès. Stop it or she'll think we've got things to hide. After you, madam detective. I'm right behind you. Let's do this. Why didn't you do something? And what did you do? Nice asthma attack. If accounting doesn't work out for you, you could try acting. I need to see all the books for the past 24 months. - Where's the bathroom? - Over there. Listen, it's really gross in there. Couldn't you take out the trash? - It's not her job. - It's not mine either. It's okay, I'll do it. Tonight. So... when can I meet with Patrick Steiner? Let me check his schedule. - Next Monday, 9 am? - Okay, I'll be here. If I haven't given birth by then. - I'll walk you out. - It's not like I have cancer. Stop it or I'll charge you with attempted bribery. - Bye! - What a bitch. Look. Less than five years. It looks like fraud. VAT fraud! Damn it, where's Patrick? - He went home. - Upset stomach. No kidding. He ate a whole Royal Pagoda. On the very day the cops are on our ass. Well, I'm off, ladies. I've got an appointment. Bye, girls. He forgot his phone. I'm on it. Patrick is such a scatterbrain! - Open up! - It's stuck. What's the matter with you? Oh my God, the bitches! You bitches! Sorry, Nico, it's for your own good. - Are you okay? - Yes. Drag him in there. I'm on it. I've got a package for Patrick Steiner. Is it you? - He's not here. - I hear you, but they don't pay me for multiple trips. I'm sorry. If you have his ID, we can make it work. Fine, I'll get it. Don't move an inch, okay? I can't say no to you. - How is he? - He's unconscious. Right. Here you are! I just need you to sign here. There we go. Did you find my services... satisfying? Very satisfying? Or very, very satisfying? It was perfect. Perfect. Have a nice day... - Miss. - Good bye, young man. What was that weird flirting about? - Weird flirting? What do you mean? - Do you think I'm blind? My ex-husband taught me to hunt. Really? You're awesome. Isn't she, Nico? - What do we do? - I don't know. We can't kill him. We can't let him go either. We'll find a solution. Don't worry. Of course, there's no need to worry at all! We're only facing life in prison! This is what happens when you don't tidy up. Oh my God, is he... Jesus... Listen. Sometimes, life offers us the solution we need. And this time, the solution life offered is death. Okay, where are the garbage bags? What a waste. The Hugh Grant of the office. - Who's Hugh Grant? - Never mind. Inès? - What should I do about the Wite-Out? - We'll tell her later. All good. We'll throw their phones and the body in the canal tonight. Well, the bodies. Inès... There's no time off in this place! EcoCleanPro. How can I help you? - Hang up! - Hold on, I don't understand. What do you call "rags"? Ah, kitchen towels! Sorry, we don't sell them. Try Everything Cotton. You're very welcome. Have a good day! I know the situation is a bit extreme, but do not interrupt me when I'm with a client. What the hell? We have two bodies to deal with and you just-- Even in times of crisis, always remember the customer is king. - At least one thing you'll learn here. - No, but really... What's with the gun? Was Patrick in the mafia? After the burglary, he had an alarm set up and he bought this, just to be sure. Patrick... He's always had that cowboy side. He didn't respect the law. But norms are only getting stricter. Asbestos removal is not cheap! So yes, we have some asbestos in the ceiling, chemicals, and a tank filled with acid in the warehouse! The tank's over there, in the back. Tom uses it for his mixtures. Are you listening? I didn't care much for EcoClean this morning, but now... - You could show some respect! - Come on... Tom's here. When are you getting to it? The storeroom door and now the toilet flush! Patrick hasn't asked me anything. Can't you ask her to fix the crapper? I'm doing an internship in accounting! Or is she as lazy as her mom? Okay, okay, I'm kidding. Just kidding. What an asshole! What did she say? - Come on, we'll scare him! - Hey! Get off my forklift! Get off my forklift! Yes, run! - You're nuts! - You were an asshole to my mom! - Asshole! - Perv! - You piece of shit! - I'll tell Patrick everything. - You won't show off as much! - It's like a joystick! - What century were you born? - It's like a video game. - You're a big piece of shit! - Where is he? There he is! Oopsie. Did you step on the wrong pedal? Tom? Tom? It was just an accident. No, it wasn't. No, you're right. Cover up. Acid is dangerous. The most dangerous thing here is you. Come on, pull him. Shall we get Nico? Okay. You got him? Let's go. For fuck's sake. A pain all the way! He's hard to drag. He's always been a drag. I've got an idea. What-- He's napping. He drank too much at lunch. - Alcohol... - A terrible evil. I'm not cleaning up, I-- I'm learning about the products. Have you heard from Patrick? - No. - Who's going to sign the new slips? That, I wonder... Always putting things off. It didn't work, did it? Not everything is black or white. Sorry, I didn't mean your... Let's see, hydriodic acid... Triflic acid. Acetylsalicylic acid. Beautiful! Okay. All good! We'll do Nico later. Come on! Would you like some tea? Green tea? - Where's Patrick? - He's not here. I can see that. You're a quick thinker, aren't you? So, Patrick isn't here. No news from Nico. He must have choked on his headset. He left for a short while. I'll just wait, then. Coffee? Is it possible? I don't have the whole day. Of course, they didn't leave an envelope for me. You can't trust people. It's disgusting! It's really awful! It's awful. What else can I say? Have you tried it? - I don't drink coffee. - It's disgusting. My coffee is very good. - Yes. - Say it. Your coffee is good. Very good. Vacuum cleaners. There are 200,000 euros! There are 200,000 euros we can split in two, or in three! Don't be foolish! Come on, don't be foolish! Just this once. Oh fuck! Oh fuck, this feels so good! - What's with you? - I don't know. Are you on a roll? I could never hurt you, Mélody! How about some Xanax? No. Why? - Here we go again! - Yes, here we go again. Quick! - Everything all right, girls? - We heard something. Indeed. This just broke! Our little domestic angels are always at it. Is it possible to get some coffee? No. It's getting late, you know. Maybe some tea? Chamomile? Well, okay. Inès, are you rebelling? I am. If even Inès turns feminist, we're in trouble. Let's go. We'll eat our waffles in the office. Yes, too bad for her. Inès is weird today, isn't she? Will you help me? We have to clean everything up. It's no use. Your colleagues-- the remaining ones-- don't get anything. And if the police show up, and they will eventually, they have cutting-edge tools to spot blood stains-- No, Mélody. Of course, we do it for the police and the colleagues, but we do it for ourselves. Mens sana in corpore sano. A healthy mind... in a clean room. - A healthy mind... - What are you suggesting? Should we just leave blood all over? Why not get a "serial killer" tattoo on our foreheads? Come on! Okay... you do what you want, but I'll go look for the money. Where's the dough? Wow, Mélody! Take it easy! Jean-Pierre and Jean-Paul are nearly off. We'll turn everything upside down. Hang on. Right. To our new sinful life. - Sorry, Lord. - Amen. Tom's all done and Nico is brewing. - Why is it always hot chicks? - What? She doesn't look like the cleaning ladies I know. This is for sales representatives. They're mostly men, so it makes sense. Men... We're off! - Could you order some Wite-Out? - Two bottles. Some... Wite-Out? - You're drunk. - No. Something has changed, right? - No. - Yes. What's that? My period. Well done, really. See you later, alligator! With the money, we could go far away! - Where are you from in Africa? - Neder-Over-Heembeek, Brussels. Oh. I don't know where I'd like to go. I've never even dreamed of it. Even in my dreams, I'm saving my money. It's cute. Where did you get it from? It was a gift from Patrick. Well... Forget about the money. As soon as Rémi is back with the van, we'll put the last bodies in the acid and then... Will we see each other again? We might end up in the same cell. You know what? At this point, I might as well kill my ex. Arnaud always treated me like furniture. I could get into his villa through the terrace and kill him with one of his big Japanese knives. No. It's too big of a risk for not much. What do you think of the death penalty? I'm not really into politics. I'm not in favor of it. But there's someone I really want to kill. Mr. De Groot, Patrick's friend. He was my favorite teacher. I loved him. I met with him in his office after class and... and he-- - He assaulted me. - Assaulted... "Assaulted"? Don't say anything to my mom! She'd die if she knew! Is that him? Yes. He doesn't look that big. Didn't you fight back? Was he armed? I was completely paralyzed. I didn't understand anything. So, he... I don't want to go through that again. If you want to help me, call him and tell him Patrick wants to see him immediately. He would recognize my voice. So you... You can kill some woman who doesn't like your coffee and I can't take revenge on someone who's ruined my whole life? You're young and you've got your whole life ahead of you. He's not worth it. Just forget about him. So you won't help me? Haven't I supported you today? Haven't I become your accomplice? Having him come here to kill him is just too much. Give it to me. Doesn't the Bible say, "Thou shalt not kill"? There is also Exodus, chapter 21, verses 23 to 25: "Thou shalt give eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand." Don't take everything literally. Some are metaphors. Okay, calm down. Call him from Patrick's landline and make him come here. Careful now. Hello, Claude De Groot? I'm calling from Mr. Steiner's office. I've got a message for you. Grab a pen. Sorry. Sorry. I can't let you make such a mistake. Patrick? Hello? Thank you for your help, Mélody, but this is going too far. Mélody? Mélody? Mélody? You're not going, are you? Good luck. Don't leave me alone, Mélody! What am I going to do without you? I'm going to mess up! She's going to call the police. I'm only coming back for the bodies, okay? No! - What's wrong? - You know the door handle is broken! Oh, shit! Oh Lord... We're stuck here with bodies all over the place. I can't believe it: I wanted to help and it's my fault again? - Couldn't you pay attention? - I've had enough of you! We're in this because you'd rather kill people than ask for a raise! What the hell? You're fucking up big time! So now, the police is calling Tom, who won't answer, of course, and the cops will be here in 10 minutes. Are you happy? You've just sent us to jail. You're going to prison! I'm innocent! You're pushing it. You pushed Patrick, you hid Nico-- Do you hear that? It's Rémi. It's Rémi! - Rémi! - Rémi! - Inès? -Help! - Inès? - Rémi! - Are you okay? - We're locked in! I'll go grab my tools. What was that? Rémi. - I hope he's not... - Come on, no! He probably got scared and just ran off. - No, he wouldn't do that. - How do you know? - I know him. - Wow! You always have to be right, really! - Why are you saying that? - You never believe me. - Of course, I do. - No, you don't. - I know you didn't believe me earlier. - About your teacher? - You didn't really explain. - Can't you just believe me? - Do you really need the details? - Well, kind of. It's hard to believe he could force himself on a strong girl like you. I didn't want it! It was rape! If it's rape every time we don't want it, then everybody-- then we all got... Anybody here? Financial Crimes. I've got a warrant. Wow. The door was open. I let myself in. - Van Duyne to dispatch. - Dispatch listening. - Double homicide. Backup needed. Over. - Okay, I'm sending you a patrol. Don't make any moves. Now is not the time to have a baby. Don't worry, I saw my ob-gyn yesterday. I'm still good cervix-wise. Over. You'll tell me all about it. Be careful. Roger. Don't worry. - Mama is handling things. -In here! In here! Help! Please, help! We're trapped. Open up! - We're trapped! - Who are you? - Who are you? - I asked first. Oh no. Open up! Police! - We've already met. - Detective Van Duyne? Indeed. Come. This way. Faster. Patrick Steiner, deceased. Three homicides, two suspects. Over. Fuck. What a night. I'm sending you the chief. Over. Roger that. - So, what happened? - I don't know. How is that possible? They must have drugged us. I was working, as usual, and I... I don't remember how I ended up locked in that room. Rémi! Rémi! Rémi! - You're alive! - Send an ambulance. - Over. -At your service. Over. - How are you, sir? - I'm fine, I... One fatality less, one injured. Over. - Rémi, you're alive! - Yes, I'm alive. The head of Benelux. So... I suppose you don't remember anything either? No, nothing. Okay. Okay. Why do I always arrive when the party's over? Wow... The news crew should be here soon. Okay. I'll take it from here. This is outside your competence. I know the financial situation of the company very well. - Ma'am. - Good evening. Miss. Come on, free these poor ladies! Wouldn't you be better off at home, knitting baby clothes? We'll find you an on-duty psychologist. You must have had a rough day. Yes. You, too. Coffee? I'd love some. Milk and sugar for me. - Can I serve it to you? - Of course! Of course, you're free. - Delicious coffee! - Really? Americano. I love it. Tell me everything. All I can say is that the door-- the door is-- was closed. - And they were locked in. - Yes. Okay, take him. We should proceed to the psychological profiling of this man, - of these women-- - Not so fast, Van Duyne. - I'm sniffing. - What? I'm sniffing! I'm smelling, I'm feeling. That's how I've cracked my biggest cases. By sniffing. - Who are you? - Claude De Groot. I got a call from Patrick Steiner. He disgusts me. It's coming back to me! Him! He dropped by this afternoon. - I didn't. - I thought you didn't remember anything. That was before the blackout. The scheming was his idea. - What? - Scheming? - That's why I have a warrant. - VAT fraud, fake invoices. - Not at all! - You can analyze this. Fake invoices between the various branches of EcoCleanPro. - Not at all! - He told them how to do it. This is good. Are you writing this down? It's one of the leads. He locked us in, and for the rest, we don't know. She's delusional. I'm a teacher! He turned everything upside down to find the money. - I'll have to clean up his mess! - They're crazy! I have nothing to do with this. Ask Steiner! It won't be easy. Come on. This is a mistake. I was at the university. You can check! I'll talk to the prosecutor. I don't think the suspects should take part-- Witnesses. They're witnesses. Look at them. We don't have any proof. My hypothesis makes perfect sense. What more do you need? An autopsy, interviews, forensics... Excuse me. I really need to go to the bathroom. We were locked in for a very long time. I understand. - I'll go with you. - Thank you. - Thank you, chief. - You're welcome. You know, all this will be settled quickly The paperwork will be a drag, but it'll be fine. Do you remember 1985? The Brabant killers? Yes. - Big case. - Indeed. The number-one investigation in Belgium. And it's still not over. Yet, back then... I can tell you that I had a huge lead. I was starting my career, but I already had that intuition. And... I was close to finding the perpetrators. Patrick Haemers had nothing to do with it. Nothing. Of course... the big leaders... silenced me. Yes. - They muzzled me. - No?! Muzzled, that's the word. Like a... an animal. I could feel there was a will to destabilize my beloved Belgium. I could feel all that. - I hope I didn't make you wait too long. - No. No, no. Ladies, as a sworn representative of the law, - I'd like to say-- - Chief! Chief! If you interrupt me one more time, I'll have you transferred to Arlon! - Got it? - But... - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! - Fire! Evacuate the premises. - Jean-Philippe! - This way! Come on, faster! Mélody, tell them I didn't do anything. That I'm innocent. Come on. The news crew's coming. - How's my hair? - Very nice. - Have a good evening. - You too. - Get some rest. - You too. I believe you're both involved in this case, but you'll get away with it and I won't make myself sick over it. Of course, not. Have a good evening. - Have a good evening. - Good bye. And congratulations to the daddy! What? Don't stay here. Move along. Mélody, I'm sorry I put you through all this, but I have some compensation for you. - Look! - No way! Your little mixture seems to work. I'm so hungry! How about sushi? - Sorry, Jean-Philippe. - Royal Pagoda? I feel like I haven't eaten since the '90s! Come on!
