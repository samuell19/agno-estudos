Yeah, you're about as busy over there selling overpriced sheets of white paper as I am over here practicing my Oscar speech. Daddy has given us his jet and villa, we take off tomorrow for an insta trip you won't forget. What? No shit. That sounds amazing. Which one of your daddy's houses are we going to? Phuket... Thailand! Are you sure it's safe there? Decap Ezra, of course it's safe. Now go pack your shit. Wheels up first thing in the morning. See y'all on a G tomorrow. Diamond out. (computer pinging) (upbeat music) Welcome, ladies. Now where the fuck is Ryder? (engine gunning) Oh, of course. (upbeat pulsing music) Nice luggage, Ryder. Fuck off, Daisy. Oh you would love to fuck Daisy. How do you know I haven't? Wow, welcome, ladies. I'm Jasper McDaniel. I'll be your pilot. We have good weather, so we should be arriving in Phuket on time. Sit back, relax, enjoy the flight, and if you guys need anything, I'll be up front. Oh my, I can think of a few things that our captain can do to me. Diamond, just let him focus on his job, which is literally making sure we don't crash and die. Fuck off. Oh this is fucking awesome! Enough of the chitchat, I want a shot. God, Daisy, the sun's barely up. Well I'm sure the sun is up in Thailand by now. And I'm just pro-actively curing future jet lag. To sex. To drugs. To rock and roll. (women cheering) (upbeat pulsing music) I think we should all go around in a circle and collectively set an intention for our vacay together. Oh my God, Ezra, stop being so fucking introspective. Like, just relax. Here, take a pull. I wanna get into some of that full moon powder and turn this beach trip into a ski trip. Ryder, what about you? I wanna connect with my friends, and have the experience of a lifetime. That sounds pretty fucking lame. I want to eat great food, sleep long nights and fuck anyone I want. (bubbling) Daddy issues. (Daisy laughing) My daddy has issues with you on his plane. There is the fucking door, Ezra. Oh my God, chill out (laughs). Well, I intend to fuck on blow and have an experience that we'll never forget. To motherfucking Thailand, yeah! (upbeat pulsing music) (indistinct singing) (singer vocalizing) (indistinct singing) (upbeat pulsing music) (engine roaring) [Daisy] I gotta piss. Oh enjoy. I'm gonna go up front to see if there's anything I can do for our captain. Hey, please don't fuck with him too much. I wanna get there in one piece. (soft music) Ryder, what the fuck? I thought we could use some alone time. Now is not the time. If not now, then when? Look, it's not easy, Ryder. I mean, life is complicated for some of us. For some of us. What's that supposed to mean? Look, I am not you. I'm not all confident wrapped up in this badassness. Daisy, you have more badass in you than you know. Just go. (Ryder sighing) (upbeat pulsing music) This is a club I thought I'd never join. The Bang Your Best Friend Club. The Mile-High, you asshole (laughs). (upbeat pulsing music) (indistinct singing) (singer vocalizing) Get some air in here, Dang. [Diamond] Knock, knock. Hello, Diamond. Everything okay? Everything's great. Just thought you could use some company. Uh, Dang, I'm stretching my legs. Controls are off to you. (soft piano music) Wow, you girls really know how to trash a plane. Uh, yeah, I've had plenty of years of experience. I believe it. Mm-hm. So you know my dad? Not personally, but I am a fan of his movies. Oh, I'm sensing a little bit of mystery to you, Captain. Mystery? Me? My life's pretty boring. I wish I had something to hide. Married? Kids? Oh no, no, no, no, no. I'm perpetually single. Mm. Well, we might have to do something to change that. What about you? Me? Oh well, that's gonna take at least a second date. (thunder rumbling) (plane jolting) Do me a favor. Grab a seat, okay? (alarm dinging) (plane jolting) Are we there? (intercom dinging) [Jasper] Okay, ladies, we hit some inclement weather. It's gonna get a little bumpy, so if you could please buckle your seat belts. We're gonna crash. We're all gonna die! Hey, hey, hey, guys, we're not gonna die. It's just a storm. Yeah, a storm we're right in the fucking middle of. We're gonna die! Ryder, I used your toothbrush, and I never told you. And, Daisy, I'm sorry I puked in the back of your car. Diamond, I'm so sorry, but I slept with your dad. (storm raging) You motherfucker! Technically, she's a fatherfucker. What is the matter with it! I just want you guys to know how much I love you. [Jasper] Ladies, quick little update. We've hit some bad whether, and the Phuket Airport has been shut down, so we're gonna land on a private airstrip outside of town. There'll be a car waiting for you, and your bags will follow and be delivered later today.

Ha ha, sucker. [Ezra] I mean seriously? Fuck you. You're sleeping in the maid's quarters. Well they always hide the good booze there anyway. (upbeat music) Cool. Oh my God.

Be careful. That's all I'm saying. You're the ultimate buzzkill, okay. Do you understand that? I'm good, I'm fine. Just be careful. Oh. Oh! Shots! [Group] Shots!

Well, I was wondering if you could help me with a little something. Anything you need on the island, we're your girls. I need some blow. We never touch that shit anymore. Oh fuck off. (upbeat music) (crowd chattering) Okay, Ezra, that's our cue to leave. Hey, fatherfucker, we're leaving! You fucked your dad! No, don't be silly. I fucked her dad. Oh my God. Oh. Do you know where Daisy is? Yeah, she went in this direction. Daisy. Daisy. Daisy? Daisy? Daisy. Daisy. (door slamming) She's gone. She's not here. Where the fuck is she? Maybe she went back to the villa. She has no idea where the villa is. She must be here. She's searching from coke. Ezra, shut up. Guys, let's just find her and get outta here. I'm like done. Daisy? Hey, have you seen my friend? Pink shirt, dreads. We just saw her walk out with two big Thai motherfuckers. You ever heard of having a girl's back? (upbeat music) So basically I'm just looking for coke. Yeah, not the cheap stuff. Okay, I need the expensive stuff for me and my friends. We're not cheap bitches. Daisy? Daisy. Hey, we've been looking for you. I'm just making a purchase from these fine gentlemen right here. That description seems to be a slight embellishment. You girls want some party? Want some company, uh? No, we don't wanna fucking party, and we don't want your company. Okay, come on, let's get a move on. Let's get the fuck outta here. But it's still going on inside? Daisy, okay, time to go. Why you be so rude? We just try to help you out. Oh, fuck you, assholes. You're coke dealers, not missionaries. Let's go. Well. Well, we aren't coke dealers neither. Now you rich bitches are gonna give us all your fucking money. Look, sirs, you can, you can have our money. Okay, but then just please don't hurt us. Please don't hurt us. (glass smashes) You guys wanna play? Let's fucking play. [Jasper] What's going on here? [Ezra] Jasper? Get the fuck out of here! This ain't your problem. Oh, I think it is. Hey, (speaks foreign language). We don't want anyone to get hurt. Okay. Remember, you asked for this. Pressing your nose where it doesn't belong. (kick striking) Please, don't shoot, okay. (punch striking) How did you do that? I guess I watched too many of your father's movies. Well, you know, we had this covered. Thank you. Thank you so much. Look, girls, I know you can take care of yourselves but this island can get dangerous, especially if you girls are looking for trouble. You got something I can write on? Here. Okay. (soft music) If you need anything, that's where I'll be. Pen and paper? This guy is so old school fucking cool. Let's go. Okay, thank you. [Daisy] Oh my God. Who are you, Jasper? I'm just a lonely pilot trying to enjoy his layover. Yeah, well you know, I watched too many of my dad's films as well, and I tend to have a pretty good read on people. A simple thank you will do. Jasper, I don't believe you. But thank you. (soft mysterious music) [Ezra] The bags arrived. Finally, I can get out of these clothes. Why, did you like shit your pants when your coke deal went south? Diamond, lay off her. I am so tired. Anyone else wanna swim? Good idea. Bring the bags to the room, put on our suits and meet you back in five. Uh uh, uh uh uh, I wasn't fucking kidding. You're over there. [Ezra] Fuck someone's dad once, it's like you're a fucking pariah. (leaves rustling) (suspenseful music) [Ryder] Everybody get out here! What the fuck? Don't even freak out if you forgot a swimsuit. I have like 20, okay? No bikini, no clothes, no nothing. Holy shit. Is that real? I know one way to find out. Hey. This bag looks just like mine. This is nuts, right? We have to call Jasper. No, uh-uh. I'm not quite sure that's our best move right now. Our best move? He just saved our lives. There is something off about him. For all we know, he's got something to do with this. You're being paranoid, Diamond. Oh, really? New pilot, first flight, we know absolutely nothing about him. Shows up out of nowhere at the club when we're in trouble. I mean, he may have been following us, guys. I'm just saying. You know what? I say we do one. We'll have a night. Call the cops in the morning to pick it up, and we just sort this shit out then. Just one? [Daisy] Yeah. Just one. No, guys, that is not a good idea. Just one. (Ryder exhaling) (crickets chirping) Okay, just one. Fuck it. Okay, start it up. I'm gonna put this somewhere safe so Miss Vacuum over there doesn't get any ideas. (bag zipping) Let's turn this shit up.

Well, your dad could have fallen in love with her, married her and made her your evil stepmommy. And then this would be my house. Oh my God, you wish. Anyway, where's our little (sniffs) bloodhound? Did she ever get to bed? I don't know. I crashed first. Mm. Should we go wake her up? What is the rush, okay? Just let her sleep. God. We have a big day planned. [Ezra] No. Daisy, we're coming for ya! Yes! Come on. Oh my, you bitch! (group chattering) (suspenseful music) Holy fuck! Oh my God. Oh my God, what are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? What is happening? What is happening? I told you we shouldn't have touched the bag. Fuck! Fuck! We have to do something. Diamond, Diamond, we have to call the cops. We have to call the cops, Diamond. Jasper, we need to call Jasper. We need to call your father. Your father would know what to do. Your dad would definitely know what to do. Shh. If we call the cops, she's dead. If we call my father, she's dead. If we call anyone, she's dead. We need to handle this. Diamond. We need to handle this. [Ryder] Diamond. How are we gonna handle this? I can't even handle it. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (men chattering) (door opening) (suspenseful music) (keys jingling) (suspenseful music) (water trickling) Diamond, this isn't one of your dad's fucking movies. This is real life. Get serious. I am serious. If what I say isn't exactly what happens, then go ahead, call the cops. What are you talking about? We're going to get a call any minute. Ezra, you're gonna answer the phone. Read exactly what I wrote. And then just, just hang up. This is not a fucking film. (phone ringing) Answer it. Answer it. (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (phone beeping) We have what you want. But, we also have a very particular set of skills. Skills that we've acquired over the years of our careers. Skills that make us a nightmare for people like you. If you let our friend go now, that'll be the end of it. We will not pursue you. But if you don't, we will look for you. We will find you. And we will kill you. (dramatic music) (phone beeping) That was fucking awesome (laughs)! You guys believe me now? Diamond, what have we gotten ourselves into? I know, but fuck this. We're gonna go save Daisy. (soft upbeat music) Okay. (Ryder laughing) Okay, let's just break down what happened. When the plane landed, somehow Ryder's bag got mixed up with some kind of drug shipment. (marker squeaking) Whew. Now, who could have done this? There were only two other people than us on the plane. (marker squeaking) But Jasper saved us. No, for all we know, he was following us to find the missing bag. We can't trust him. We can't trust anyone. (mysterious music) Okay, they come in last night looking for their product. They couldn't find it, so they take collateral, Daisy. (marker squeaking) This is seriously nuts. We have what they want. Well, they have what we want. Who is they? It's a golden triangle. What is a golden triangle? It's the area where the borders of Laos, Myanmar and Thailand meet. One of the world's busiest drug trafficking regions, and, guys, we've just fucked with the balance of the Thai's drug cartel. Oh shit! Oh fuck. Oh my God. (lighter clicking) So what's our next move? They will contact us and deliver instructions for the drop and trade for Daisy. Likely somewhere in town with lots of people around. Diamond, this is all just like a little bit too much, but I don't think that growing up on your dad's movie sets makes you exactly qualified or me exactly qualified to, you know, do a hostage rescue situation. Yeah, I'm with her. You have to believe me. I know we all love Daisy and we need her back safe, but at this point, the only ones that are going to be able to do this are the three of us. I do have one question, though. Yeah, so do I. Where's the blow? Where's the cocaine? Follow me. (mysterious music) (device beeping) [Ryder] What is this? Panic room. Okay, so you tell us now that you have a panic room? Because this is like a totally normal thing that one has in the house, right? (mysterious music) What up? This is fucking awesome. [Ezra] That's a lot of guns. What is that? Oh, that's a Replicator. It's a 3-D printer. This is fucking badass! Okay, why does Daddy... What does your daddy have one of these? Uh, because he's rich and famous and his life has value. He builds these panic rooms for us everywhere. Like, gives him peace of mind. And here it is. No one knows about this room. There is no way of finding it, tracking it. It's basically invisible. Diamond, what are we gonna do? We're going to town and act as if nothing has happened. We don't alert anyone. They will find us and deliver instructions for the drop and trade for Daisy. Okay, and then what next? Then the shit, all gets real. Who fucking has one of these? I bail. (beeping) (soft mysterious music) [Ezra] There's so many people. Are you sure this was a good idea? Three beers please. Okay, I'm with Ezra. How are we gonna do this on our own? By staying calm. I'm so stressed out. Look, if it was just one of us, we would be in deep shit. If it was just two of us, we would be totally fucked. But the three of us together, we make up one pretty fucking lethal weapon. How do you figure? We have the brains, the body and the bimbo. Go on, yeah. I have lived every one of my dad's films. I know these guys, what they think, how they plan. I know their moves before they do. I'm the brains. Ryder, you are the body. Your years of avoiding anything in life that is actually fun and focusing all your energy on those extreme sporty things gives you a leg up on these cocksuckers. When we need some physical action, it's you. Oh, so that makes me the bimbo. And what exactly do you mean by that? It means, you're an actor. You're our voice. The words we say need to come convincingly from you. Yeah, I can do that but I'm really fucking stressed out. I'm literally panicking. Chill. (engines revving) (boy speaking Thai) What did he say? Fuck do I know? (boy speaking Thai) The boy is saying the daisies are in full bloom. No they're not. They're like wilted. Buy the flowers. Buy them now, buy them. Oh shit. Uh. Thank you. Thank you. (mysterious music) What do we do? Open it. Carefully. Me? I don't want to. Could be a bomb. Shut up. Just do it. (people chattering) [Diamond] What is it? Oh, shit. Come over. (mysterious music) Turn it on. No, no. No. Turn it on carefully. (mysterious music) (device beeping) This here is a banana spider. It is the most venomous spider in the world. There is no antivenom. So I suggest that you don't move. (Daisy whimpering) Shh, shh, shh, shh. (clicks tongue) Come on, baby. There we go. (Daisy whimpering) Okay. Listen to me carefully. Go to the Fountain Circle at Old Geptown. There you will see a big banyan tree. Be on the bench next to it tomorrow at noon. Bring the product, and I'll bring your friend. (Spyder chuckles) (Daisy crying) Oh my God. Oh my God. This is so fucked up. If anything happens to Daisy, if anything happens-- She will be fine. Okay. She is really strong. Okay, we're just gonna follow their instructions and... by this time tomorrow Daisy will be back with us and we can get the fuck out of here. She's right. Let's just get back to the villa and plan for tomorrow. Oh my God, Ezra. I am sorry. You need to be clear of mind. Come on. (mysterious music) We need to get ready for tomorrow. Always be prepared for the worst. (waves crashing) Yeah, and what's that? These guys don't give a shit about us. As soon as they get their stuff back, we no longer have any value to them. We can't trust anything they say. They will try to cheat us. [Ezra] And then what? Plan B. What's Plan B? That is a very good question I don't have the answer to right now. Anyway, tomorrow, Ryder, you will do the drop. Ezra and I will find vantage points where we can see everything that's going on. We'll be your eyes and ears. Eyes and ears. (waves crashing) So what next? Target practice. Are you fucking kidding me? Okay, ladies, now, the most important thing when you're firing a gun is your breath. Control your breathing to keep yourself steady. (gun firing) Take aim through here and slowly pull the trigger. (gun firing) (gun firing) You need to be gentle. Slow. It's the foreplay before the fuck. (gun firing) (glass smashing) Why doesn't that surprise me? Years of working on that bullshit cop show, and still nothing to show for it. Okay, let me make this easy for you. Hold the rifle steadily. Put the butt firmly into the pocket of your shoulder. Relax your body. Aim that little dot where you want the bullet to go. And fire. Okay. Are you positive that we should be handling these things? Like what, what makes you such an expert on this, Diamond, like playing with your dad's toys? Dad's toys? (gun firing and glass smashing) Yeah, I suppose so. Get some sleep, ladies. (upbeat music) (music stops) [Ezra] Do you think it's gonna be hot on the roof? It's showtime. Yeah, but can we please, like, be careful? Yeah, sure. Whatever, Mom. What's in the bag? More toys. You ready? Let's go. She's fucking crazy. (suspenseful music) (bag unzipping) (bag unzipping) (gun clicking) (suspenseful music) Come to Thailand, it'll be sick. It'll be a blast. Oh Ryder, you're doing just fine. Just take a seat on the bench. You look great, by the way. (suspenseful music) (phone ringing) Shit, there's a phone here. What do I do? Answer it. Don't speak, just listen. (phone ringing) (phone beeping) There's a black van that's pulling into the square right now. Look to your left. (suspenseful music) Also, there's a trash bin beyond the tree. Drop the duffel bag into the bin, and we'll let your friend go. (suspenseful music) Something does not feel right. Ryder, just put the drugs in the trash bin and let's get Daisy home. (phone beeping) (suspenseful music) Fuck, fuck, fuck. (heart pounding) (gun firing) It's not her! Shit, run! (guns firing) Okay, let's go. (engines revving) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (Ryder grunting) (guns firing) (engines revving) (gun firing) (engines revving) (Ryder panting) Stop, stop, stop! (engines revving) (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (Ryder crashing) (man shouting in Thai) (dramatic music) (Ryder groaning) (dramatic music) (brakes squealing) Ah! Fuckers! We are in way over our heads, and we need to call the cops now! No cops, Ezra. Diamond's right. These assholes fucked with the wrong girls. Payback's gonna be a bitch. Okay, tough guy, one problem. We have no leverage. They have Daisy and now they also have the cocaine. Fuck, she's right. (birds singing) We're fucking screwed. Holy shit. Holy shit. Yeah, they were never going to just hand Daisy back to us. This was always the first step in getting her back. That's how I knew it wasn't Daisy today. Bold move D-dog, you gonna tell us or? I needed you guys to be convincing. Okay, I just, I need a break. I am so stressed out right now. (TV beeping on) Wait, if the coke was here, then-- What was in the bag I gave them? Oh, it was just filled with Ezra's panties, bras and all. (Ryder laughing) Okay, so are we even now? Not even. But we're getting there. All right, what's next? Plan B. (newscaster speaking Thai) What are you thinking? Of the Thai drug cartel, an avid supporter of Muay Thai Koon has been rumored to be training his prizefighter known as Goliath in a completely unconventional way. Pause it. Pause it, pause it, pause it. What are you thinking? Tomorrow at the fight club, we're gonna kidnap the head of Thai's drug cartel. and trade him for Daisy. What the fuck? What the fuck? You've lost your mind. You've lost your mind. No, I'm down. I'll do whatever it takes to get Daisy back. Good to know. We've gotta start stretching. Fine, what's the plan? Ezra, are you still shooting up that teen tox? (Ezra laughing) What? Now and then. Oh. Go grab your syringes. Then go to Daisy's room and take all of her sleeping pills. Ryder, you know how to work that 3-D printer? Fuck yeah. Okay, it's time to kiss my Balmain latex one-piece goodbye. [Ezra] Why? Trust me. Okay, let's go. Okay. (upbeat electronic music) (gun clicking) (pestle clacking) (upbeat electronic music) (can spraying) (upbeat electronic music) (TV beeping on) In our path, he will be the next undis-- (TV beeping off) (upbeat electronic music) (music stops) (water lapping) I really hope you don't expect us to go out with you tonight. No. I don't want us to go out. Great, great. I'm going out. What? I'm seeing Jasper. Oh. You really think tonight is the time for you to dip your butt back to the dating pool? Well, you know, there's something off about him. Something he's not telling us. And you're gonna use your vagina to get it outta him? No, babe. But for all we know, he's got something to do with this. So, you know what they say, keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer. Yeah, you know what they also say? Don't fuck the enemy. Focus on tomorrow. Make sure you understand exactly what needs to be done. We mess up, we're all dead. Don't wait up. (water lapping) (soft suspenseful music) (patrons chattering) [Jasper] Wow. You clean up nice. And you barely cleaned up at all. Vodka martini, shaken, not stirred. (soft music) So, are you surprised I called? No. I'm not. I'm more surprised you called and you're not in some kind of trouble. Funny. How's the trip going so far? Mm, could be better. Could be worse. Right. What about Daisy? Daisy seemed a little shaken up the other night. Daisy, you know, she's Daisy. Always seems to get in trouble, but always finds her way out. Cheers. Right. What's your deal, Diamond? I feel like there's a lot going on inside of you that you don't allow people to see. There's always more. Okay, go on. Look, everyone thinks growing up in Hollywood, jumping around the world, they think this life is a dream come true. And in so many ways it is. But, my mom left when I was a kid. One night she just packed up and was gone. No goodbyes, nothing. My dad took it really hard. He struggled for years. He put all his energy into his work, and nothing else mattered. Not even me. I guess work became his drug and then it was success, and now it's the girls. Trying to make him feel young again. And, in the midst of all this, I had to grow up on my own. Figure out who I really am and what I really want and I think I'm still trying. I think you're doing a pretty good job. (patrons chattering) You wanna take a walk? Mm-hm. So, what's your deal, Jasper? Me? Yeah, the man with many questions and never a single answer. Um. (stone splashing) There's not really much glitz and glamor in my life. I mean... my parents split up when I was young and, careful, my dad was a New York cop. Mm? My mom took a cushy job in LA and kinda, just like you, was fending for my own. Right? We had enough to make ends meet, but pretty much raised myself, you know. Don't know if I did a good job, but yeah, flying is the only thing that made me feel free. Flying up there, high above my troubles. (waves lapping) I guess we have more in common with each other than we thought. Yeah. ♪ Watch ♪ ♪ Your next step ♪ ♪ Because you're playing ♪ ♪ With madness ♪ ♪ You'll get burned ♪ ♪ Hearts on fire ♪ ♪ If you're taking ♪ ♪ Your chances, you better have luck tonight ♪ ♪ You better bring a knife to the fight ♪ ♪ I'm gonna taste your tears ♪ (wind blowing) (fan whirring) (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) (bag unzipping) Shit, it's Ryder's bag. Fucker. (soft suspenseful music) (birds chirping) (water lapping) (Ezra whistling) Wow, well that was a long drink. Fuck you. I see what you mean about keeping the enemies close. Did you find anything out at least? Yeah, I found out we can't trust Jasper. Oh, shit. (exhales) You have all the supplies? Yeah. [Diamond] You got everything? Mm-hm. Everything. You understand exactly what we're doing? Diamond, we're fine. Follow the plan, we get Daisy back. Follow the plan, we get Daisy back. Follow the plan, we get Daisy back. (fist thudding) (kick striking) (Goliath screaming) (crowd cheering) Another victim falls to our Goliath. There is no obstacle in our path. He will be the next undisputed champion. He is unstoppable. Another day, and he's destroyed everyone in sight. (crowd cheering) Got time for one more? A woman? Here's our buy-in. Ryder, go get ready. (Ryder spitting) You just bought a ticket for your friend's funeral. Do you have a name? Diamond. Just Diamond? Just Diamond. And what brings you to my country, Just Diamond? I'm here on vacation. And how has that been so far? Pretty uneventful. We'll certainly have to change that, won't we? (lighter clicking) I'm counting on that. (crowd jeering) (dramatic music) I'll be gracious and keep all your money. Tell your friend to go home. She has nothing to prove. Perhaps we can get to know each other a little better. How about I make you that same offer? (upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (upbeat music) I've been saving this for a special occasion. You found it. (glasses clinking) (upbeat music) (kicks striking) (punches striking) (crowd cheering) (kick striking) (body thudding) (crowd cheering) (blows striking) (both grunting) (body thudding) (Goliath screaming) The end is near for your friend. Shall we double the wager? Diamond, you shine bright, but clearly flawed. (crowd cheering) (Ryder spitting) (kicks striking) (punches striking) (blows striking) (both groaning) (bones crackling) (body thudding) (soft dramatic music) (kick striking) (crowd jeering) I've never lost in anything. (soft music) Let's fuck. (soft music) (crowd booing) What kind of girl do you think I am? Ryder, grab your shit and let's get out of here. (dramatic music) Did you really think you would leave without me? [Diamond] Get in. I thought you'd never ask. (upbeat music) [Diamond] Let's go. Holy fuck, we did it. My heart's about to explode. Guys, this is still so far from over. How many sleeping pills did you shoot him up with? Enough.

You're tied up pretty good. Where am I? Where you are doesn't matter. Where our friend Daisy is does. What is Daisy? Daisy is our friend that your cartel kidnapped. And I know nothing of this. You see, that I believe. But all we wanted was to come to Phuket, have a little vacay, maybe dance a bit, drink a bit, fuck a bit. But that just isn't happening now. She's right. We get back to our villa on our first night and my shit-for-crap duffel bag is full of bricks of cocaine. Somehow your product got mixed up with our luggage. And we wake up the next morning and our friend Daisy is gone. (alarm blaring) (soft suspenseful music) Silly bitches, did you not think that they would come looking for me? Oh sweetheart, of course we did. (women screaming) (screaming stops) (women screaming) (screaming stops) (women screaming) We're over here! Come up here! Come and get us! We've kidnapped the head of the Thai drug cartel, and he's being held hostage by three... [Women] Silly, silly bitches! Oh, you're basically dab smack in the middle of nowhere. No one can hear you, and no one is ever going to find you. See, we needed something more valuable than coke to get her back. We needed you. (soft mysterious music) (music stops) Oh, your boyfriend's here. You have a boyfriend? Sorry, man. I'm gonna go see what he wants. Jasper? What are you doing here? (soft suspenseful music) Well you left rather quickly in the morning, so I thought I'd just check up on you. I'm fine. I'm a big girl. I don't need anyone checking in on me. Diamond, there's something you should know, okay? Don't move an inch more. I will light you up, Jasper, or whoever the fuck you are. Diamond, put the gun down, okay? Come on. I know you're involved in all this. I found Ryder's bag in your room. All right, you're right. You're absolutely right. I've been watching you girls, but I know all about the drugs, okay. Raise your hands. I'm with the fucking DEA. The badge is in my back pocket. Show me. Slowly. (soft suspenseful music) (badge clattering) (birds singing) What the fuck? (soft suspenseful music) They're using your father's jet as a mule. They've been chartering cocaine in and out of the golden triangle for years. We've got the pilot in custody. He's been working with the cartel. Is my dad involved in this? No, he's not. He doesn't know anything about it. What happened? We hit some bad air. Got there a little bit ahead of schedule. The plan was to make another run to the US. Look, I don't know. Honestly, I don't know how the bags got mixed up. But you knew about Daisy and her being kidnapped. I do. I assumed they would come back to the villa for the bags. I didn't think they were gonna snatch up Daisy. These are bad fucking dudes. I'm in too deep with them. I can't blow my cover. I do have a contact at the DEA. He's gonna call the embassy. Hopefully set up a rescue team for Daisy. No, no fucking way. What? We've got this covered. What do you got covered? This is the Thai drug cartel. Well now that you've been honest with me, I should probably come clean with you. (TV beeping on) What the fuck is this? That's the head of Thai cartel. Calm down. Calm down. D, this isn't a fucking movie. You're not Wonder Woman. Fuck you. Because I'm a girl, I'm Wonder Woman? No, I just don't want you to get hurt. You actually care, don't you? Of course I care. Let's do it like this. Just give me 24 hours. If we can't get Daisy back on our own, do what you need to do. But, you know, best-case scenario, we rescue Daisy, you get to keep your cover and we all go back to our lives before all this mess. (Jasper exhaling) I can't believe I'm gonna say this. You've got 24 hours, okay? Oh wait. There's one thing I'm gonna need from you. Yeah, what's that? Meet me here tomorrow morning. I'll explain then. So cute. Anyway. (mysterious music) (soft upbeat music) (shears snipping) Are you trying to scare me? Are you kidding me? Do you not think I've been tortured before? Oh, ye of little faith. (shears snipping) Muzzle this fucker. (Koon groaning) Oh Ryder, what the fuck? You're not the only one with toys. (muffled speaking) And it's pink. Okay. (Koon groaning) (computer beeping) You think there's a game? You must not value your friend's life. Well, I guess we don't. So fucking kill her. Don't push me, little girls. How do you know she's not already dead? Oh, because I have what you want, and the only way you're gonna get it back is by giving me what I want. And you think you have leverage? You don't. I don't give a fuck about the coke! But, Spyder, it's not the coke that is our leverage. It's the delivery boy. (Koon groaning) Jesus Fucking Christ. Meet me tomorrow at the Big Buddha Temple, same time. You wanna see him alive, you do exactly as I say. (computer beeping) Unmuzzle him. (soft music) Do you think you're gonna leave that place alive? Oh, who's the fool now? We have no intention to ever meet there or anywhere tomorrow. Now, you're gonna tell us where the fuck your goons are keeping our friend. Or what? You gonna cut off my finger?

You better think carefully about your next word. (soft suspenseful music) There's a factory. Your friend is being held there. What else? We need location, security and any surprises along the way. Remember, if we don't find Daisy, no one is ever going to find you. Snip, snip. Well, finally my bag's here. At least I can get outta these nip clips and minis. No offense, guys. (bag unzipping) (Ryder sighing) Okay, I never, like, literally never thought I would ever utter these words, but, Ryder, you're gonna need to lend Ezra and me something to wear. No. With pleasure. All right, what about Koon, what are we doing with him? Well for now, he stays locked away. No one will find him until we decide the time is right. We could still chop his dick off.

(suspenseful music) (Koon groaning) (soft suspenseful music) Jesus Christ. Diamond, what have you done? (Koon breathing hard) Multiple countries have tried to bring you and your family down for years. Millions of dollars in resources spent, and it's gonna be these three girls who single-handedly dismantle the Thai cartel mafia. How do you feel about that? (Koon breathing hard) (birds calling) (soft suspenseful music) Okay, you both understand the plan? I extract, you distract. Daisy, we're coming for ya. All right, let's move. (birds calling) (suspenseful music) (leaves crunching) (soft suspenseful music) (men shouting in Thai) (engine revving) Okay, Ryder's in. Take your position. Make sure to be ready for us. We're gonna have to fucking hightail it out of there. Diamond, I just want you to know that I'm sorry. Ezra, let's just cross this first bridge for Daisy, okay? Okay.

Fuck you. Spare the impertinence, my darling. Now, where's Tok Koon? He's safe. Safe? You think you're so beautiful, so smart. You think you're a bunch of American cowgirls, you're gonna ride in here and save the day? I don't think so. You know why? Because you're nothing. You're fucking nothing. I would think twice about that. (men shouting in Thai) I got the cocksucker. (guns firing) (men screaming) Daisy! Ryder! (attacker groaning) Ryder! (dramatic music) (kick striking) (fist thudding) (man shouting) (kick striking) (attacker groaning) (blows striking) (both groaning) (dramatic music) (blow striking) (body thudding) (Daisy screaming) Ryder! Ryder. Are you okay? I'm fine, I'm fine. Are you okay? I'm fine. And what did I tell you? I am a fucking badass. Yes, you are. Daisy, Daisy, I love you. I fucking love you, Ryder. (soft music) Now let's get outta here. Come on. (soft music) We're taking our friend, and once we do, Koon will be let out of our custody. Why should I believe you? You will have double-crossed the head of the cartel, and you're gonna have a lot more to be worried about than just three cowgirls. You may walk outta here today, thinking you've won. You haven't. 'Cause it's not about the ones who are chasing behind you. It's about the ones who are already there ahead of you. We're gonna find you, catch you, and we're gonna kill all of you. Revenge is gonna be sweet juice that I lick off your dead bodies. Drink this. (gun firing) You asshole. No! [Ezra] Oh my God. Thank God, you're okay. I'm fine. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.

(truck engine revving) (engine starting) (engine revving) (truck banging) I was fucking shot. Oh, fuck! Hey, you're gonna be fine. Just keep pressure on your wound. Diamond, I'm really sorry, I'm so sorry. Screw it. After this, you can fuck anyone you want in my family. (engine revving) (lighter clicking) Hasta la vista, bitches. (flames roaring) (engine roaring) (explosion) Did they get Ryder? No, they didn't get Ryder. That was motherfucking Ryder! (engine roaring) (men shouting in Thai) Okay, we're almost there. Almost where? God, we've got company. (men shouting in Thai) (engines roaring) Daisy, it's time for a little payback. Just release the clip, aim and fire. You got this, D. (dramatic music) (rocket firing) (truck exploding) (truck exploding) Fuck yeah! (guns firing) Oh, fuck it hurts! You're gonna be fine. I promise you're gonna be fine. Just take it easy, okay. I'm not gonna let anything happen to you. It's jammed! Hold tight, ladies. (dramatic music) (engine roaring) (dramatic music) (tires squealing) Ah. You almost fucking got away with it. You almost rode off into the sunset. And what makes you think we haven't? Look around you, Cowgirl. Remember? I warned you. You sure did. (dramatic music) Yeehaw, motherfucker. (dramatic music) All right, everybody, get on the fucking ground! (officers shouting) [Officer] Get down! Move! Get down! [Officer] Stay down, motherfucker! (officers shouting) (dramatic music) Ladies, welcome aboard. I'll be your pilot, Jasper McDaniel. Hm-hm. (upbeat pulsing music) (engine roaring) Was this like the best girls trip ever or what? Actually, yes. By the way, when did the two of you start munching on each other? (both laughing) Diamond, shut up. They're cute. I mean, they might be in love. You're not wrong. Seriously, for better or worse, this is the trip I'll never forget. I mean, Ezra just took a fucking bullet, repaired her broken relationship with Diamond, and Diamond for once in her life has actually found someone she likes more than herself. And I, for once, can be the real me. (lips smacking) [Jasper] Allow me, just a little toast. Yes. There we go. Ladies, to an inspiring group of heroes. Heroes? Fuck that, we are Sheroes.
