The Key That Can't Be Shared I think I have met everyone by now... Apart from one form - 10B. That's Marina Maksimovna's form. She's a unique teacher. You'll meet her soon enough. - We need to replace this. - Nobody's been in charge for a while. Serafima Osipovna started to lose her sight two years ago, and many took advantage of this. - Kids? - Not just kids... Kiril Alekseyevich, let me introduce you to 10B... It's fine, thank you. I will meet them myself. As you wish. What would you say to the entire human race if you could? What do you think? I wasn't sure about it. - You were right to be unsure. - Why? - You can't speak to everyone. - Technically, it's possible... - I would refuse. - He's not old enough yet. - Who's old enough, you? - That's not important. Words must be short and simple. Like a motto or a slogan. A wise man once said that a seed won't grow on a stone, It must be placed in the ground. I don't think we have enough ground for this seed to grow just yet. Everyone is so different, so only a few people might agree with you. How can you find a different approach for every person if you need to say everything all at once? This opportunity to speak to everyone would be very short, it's unrealistic. One way of speaking to the entire human race, which is possibly the most effective way, and probably a much more interesting and deeper way, is through art, and through music. People might be hungry, so you need to feed them... if you wish to speak to them about something. I think that you can influence people... and awaken their conscience, by... giving them what they need the most at this moment in time. We are all dicussing the question 'What would you say to the entire human race if you could?' We can do this already - through books! If we really want to speak to everyone, we should speak through the language of thought, so that everyone can understand. We need to reach inside everyone's head, since everything depends on the mind. Have you ever told someone you loved them? No and I hope that I never have to. - Did you read that in a book? - No, that's my opinion. Of course... That's just temporary. Temporary! - No, it's not. - One day, you will! Impossible. You definitely will. Why not? Because he's above it! He will tell her through the language of thought! Is everyone truly happy in this world? You've spoken already. Let me speak. Well, I'm against war. I think that war is... Every life is... unique. If I could, I would say to everyone... 'Let's be kind to each other.' We often talk about it, but we don't always do it. How can we make this work? If everyone is good, then they will look for evil in good. And if we only had evil, we would find the good in evil. And the worst characteristics could be considered to be the best. So, what I would say to the entire human race, even though it's very difficult to put it into words, is that you should always be yourself. If you're evil, then be evil, so that everyone can see it. You need to believe in people. I think that beauty is very important. It touches people. It encourages the best in people. Take for example, Pavlova and her dancing... Every person - good and bad - enjoys her performances... No need to explain anything. You need to speak to someone's soul, because that's where you can find the good in people. Words are useless here. Marina Maksimovna, you place too much importance on words. Truth can only exist if it is spoken. What does Sasha Maydanov think? That's my business. Which question will you choose? Neither. None of this matters. - They won't ask me any of this. - Stop it, Maydanov. Stop what? Telling the truth? Marina Maksimovna, just kick him out! Kick him out! I will go myself! Why do you need to reach into people's souls? Smorodin, where are you going? Maydanov, I'm asking you, - Go back and apologize. - I'm sorry for your glasses. Bye! Maydanov! That's all. Who would like to offer a new question instead? Anna Karenina and the modern marriage. - How did you spend your summer? - With my grandmother! Alright, guys, that's enough. The second question is: 'The necessity of excess'. - Not like cars, fur coats and dachas? - That's also necessary. - Why aren't you in a lesson? - They let me go. - Which form? - 10B! And where are you going? - Hello. - Hello... - Why aren't you in a lesson? - I broke my glasses. - How's your hearing? - Bad eyesight and broken glasses... - make me inadequate. - Which form are you in? 10B. Kiril Alekseyevich! Do you have anything to tell me? Anything? - About your lesson? - Yes. - You know, Emma Petrovna... - Emma Pavlovna. Sorry, Emma Pavlovna, I'm still bad with names... What can I say... - Sometimes, a lesson goes well, or... - I understand, it went badly. - Badly, yes. - Let's not stand around, then. I have a free period. Were you bored when Myakishova was giving an answer? Poor girl couldn't stop babbling... She herself doesn't know why. But it was a good effort. To be honest, I was so confused, I forgot what problem I gave her... You'll have to excuse me, Emma Pavlovna... It's all your fault! - Mine? - Yes. A strange man sitting in on the lesson... A very interesting man... Put yourself in my shoes! Must be difficult... I was surprised that you gave her a B... B minus. It was a solid C, but I felt sorry for her. She was so pale... and used up so much chalk for nothing! You think they need inorganic chemistry? No... They only need it in the shops, or around the house... in their wardrobes, as night dresses, lingerie, tops... They all want to be a bride. They wear gold watches and rings... Myakishova would be a bride by now if this was India... So this B minus is part of her dowry? So that she can be just like an Indian bride? Go Myakisheva! Do they get better grades in India as well? Kiril Alekseyevich, you are a wonderful addition to our staff. I don't know about that... You are a man of many qualities, and so cheerful and witty! I'm sorry, what time is it right now? I need to visit 10B during their literature class. I don't envy you right now... Yes, I don't envy myself right now... - No, thank you. I don't smoke. I... - Chew them? I hope you will visit me again soon, Kiril Aleskeyevich. Goodbye. If we didn't talk, we wouldn't know about each other... We would just be objects to each other... like wardrobes. Don't be foolish. Hello. - Sit down. - Sit down, guys. Can I sit in on your lesson, Marina Maksimovna? Of course. Come in. Prakhov, move up. Ira, continue, you were doing very well... No, I finished. Andrey wanted to say something... Ok, Andrey... That's the answer. We shouldn't be wardrobes to each other. Ok, let's talk about the first question now. 'Why was 'Macbeth' a failure?' - We've talked enough now. - Ok, good. Now you know the questions for the essay. They are due in on Wednesday. Don't forget! Now, let's return to today's topic. Alexey Tolstoy's Peter the First. Excuse me, Marina Maksimovna. I only really came in here to meet everyone. I'll get out of your way as soon as possible. My name is Kiril Alekseyevich. I am your new headmaster. I will also be teaching Social Science to year 10 pupils. And I will be in charge of the Car Club. I'm sorry, did you let those two boys leave the lesson? - Yes, I did. - Ok. Please, continue with your lesson. Thank you. Verochka, I'm taking Herzen. Is that ok? Verochka has gone home! Er... Marina Maksimovna? Maksimovna, right? Yes. Verochka has... given me a list of books on teaching methods. Could you help me? Which ones should I read? Which ones should I read first? There's so much here... so I got a bit confused. Yes, a lot is written about our job. May be you should start with this one? And the rest can wait... This is just fancy writing... I need something more specific. I don't know... Why don't you take it home? No, I can't. I have a sofa at home... and a wife... and a daughter. Marina Maksimovna, was 'Macbeth' really a failure? Yes, we went to see it ourselves. I haven't seen anything about this in the press... Why are you still at school? Don't you have children waiting for you at home? No, my son is at kindergarten until 7pm. - How old is he? - Four. Where does your husband work? I'm sorry, my pupils are waiting for me. You run a Literature Club? No, we just had an argument. They argue with you? Why? Is it not allowed? No... You can have arguments... They're probably hungry. Let them go home and have their dinner. They are young. It breaks their daily routine and affects other subjects. I'm not forcing them to stay. They're old enough to know what they want. Of course, they're not children anymore... Do you often set them questions like that? I try to set them quite often. Today was an exception. I had two free periods, and I have the right to set them, don't I? - Can I go? - Yes. Thank you for your advice. Hello, trouble! Your parents are home! - Parents! - Come here! - On the cheek! - Thank you! - What are you wearing? - Wow, what a casette player! - Do you like it? - Everyone will be so jealous! Where have you been? Are you tired? - Oh yes. - Is that fish? - Yes. Where are my slippers? - I'll bring them now. A live fish! It's still in the water! It probably died on our way here. - Where did you get it from? - We caught it! We went to every single shop... Get changed! Walking around with a bare belly! - It's ok. - Not even on your own birthday?! - Sit down, you must be tired. - Yes, I am. - Are we celebrating today? - Of course. Great! Can I invite my friends? Of course, you can. We invited ours already. - Who? - Akimov, Sevok, Titovs. Put that in the freezer! - What about butter? - Huh? - Who needs Titov here? - You need him. - I don't need him. - Don't need him... One minute.... Yes? I'll call her over! Birthday girl - phone! Congratulations! The bag fell over... Is that Marina? - Yes? - Don't put the phone down. I don't have enough change! - What if I do? - I'll have to borrow some again. Listen, Maryulya, Happy Birthday! I wish you all the best! Stay healthy! - Thanks. - I was a fool in class... Hm, this is progress! I change for English. I shall be at the canal at known place in an hour. What? Say that again! I will start tweeting like a bird soon! Give me some privacy! Yes, why are we standing here? - She's all grown up! - I'm not blind. I can see that. Listen, I will be on Griboyedov Street in an hour. You know the entrance. You can come, if you want. But you'll need to apologize first... Are you not bored of this? No, would you believe it. That's bad. Let's go to Toksovo, like the last time! My aunt is away. It's nice there. There are squirrels... I'm not going anywhere! You acted like a jerk with Marina. I hated you and I won't forget it anytime soon. Say hello to the squirrels! Ok, I got it. - Was that Marina Maksimovna? - No. Where are you going? For a walk. - What walk? - Don't be long! What do you mean? Who's going to help me? - I can help... - Wait a minute. I changed my mind about celebrating my birthday. You invited your friends, so you can celebrate with them! And you can stop trying to set me up with people! - I'm sick of it. - What? Why do you need me here? You can talk to the Titovs, watch some TV... I'd smack you right now! Be back in an hour. I'll think about it. Say hello to the Titovs. I don't understand it. I understand everything. I'm an elephant! Oh no, don't pull my nose! Let me go! You deserve it! Now I'm a dolphin. But oh no, there's a shark! Save yourselves! Now I'm a tiger... You're not a tiger, you're a dolphin! - I will be a tiger. - No, you won't! Look, I can growl! Take that! You'll know not to come around here! Take that, on your hat! I got your bum again! Wait, Anton. Do that again? Try it... Just like your mum! - How many candles? - Seventeen. - Seventeen already? - Yes. Give me the cake, I'll do it. Yeah, ever since I became seventeen... What happened? - I feel like an old man. - Isn't that a bit early? Still, I feel very old. Do people give up their seat for you on the tram? So, what, you think that I'm an old woman? Wait, Seryozha... so, you know everything about life now? You solved all the problems, you understand everything, right? - Not quite. - How so? The thing is... a person only really lives until he's thirty... and afterwards, he is completely inert. No joys in life, no surprises... - What about accidents? - That's not exactly joyful... It's impossible to talk to you right now. So, I'll talk to you in 15 years time, ok? Yul'ka is coming! - What is she holding? - A cassette player! - I remember, it's her present! - How did you see that from here? - Alla, grab the guitar! - Yes, Marina Maksimovna! - It's here already! - Will you get off that chair? Here she comes. She has no idea about our surprise! What do you expect, Andrey? She's seventeen! Yes, our girls are getting old! Alright, open the door! You are so wet from the snow! Wait for me! Thank you! Pasha, grab my coat! Yulya, this is for you! Thank you, guys! My parents gave me a cassette player! Maydanov was the first to wish me a Happy Birthday... - And your parents? - They don't count. Are you celebrating with them today? No, we've already celebrated. Why did Maydanov not come with you? He went to his dacha, in Toksovo. There are squirrels... and snow. Squirrels and snow... sounds wonderful. Did he invite you? Where are we going? - Where are we going? - Over there, to those slopes. San', are they coming for you by any chance? We're almost here! Looks like it's for me... I don't believe it! What are they doing? Over the flowing water Chasing its shadow - the dragonfly. This is going to be a long one, I can feel it... - See you later! - Bye! All hail the Birthday girl! Let's get her! Hurrah! Come on, a little more! Come on, let's get up! - Maydanov, what are you doing? - Really, what is he doing? We're finally free! Get up! Come on! Help us out, guys! Maydanov, come here! Where are the squirrels? Where are they? And why don't you come to see us? Why not? I'm busy. - You're lying. - No. Yes. We're alway together. Do you believe me? Yes, I believe. But he doesn't believe me. He is jealous that you're spending time with me. No, Marina Maksimovna... - I can't walk anymore. - Let's sit down here. He's jealous. Jealous? He's always jealous. This doesn't make sense. Why doesn't he just come to mine? I don't understand. Just like everyone else? Marina Maksimovna, I could bring him, if you like... - Would that be better? - No, you can't force him. Why did you guys come here? Be honest. - Don't mess with my mind. - If only it was there to mess with. I'll find out anyway. Is it down to Marina Maksimovna? - Yes, Marina. - Yeah? - I knew it! - So? Nothing. What does she want? Your Highness is unhappy with his visitors? Would you prefer some peace and solitude in the countryside? Yes, you interrupted my plans. She should relax. It's the weekend. Why are you being rude? You think I'm joking, lanky? Yeah? I don't believe any of you. I'm sick of you pretending to care. Are you trying to make a softie out of me? It's not going to happen! Take that! - I don't believe you. - What's it got to do with me? I don't care. Take that! I believe the Deputy Head more! - I never knew you were such a fool. - Be quiet. What's she done to you? Nothing. I just don't believe her. I believe the Deputy Head. She's single and bored. So she spends time with you lot. Young. Beautiful. She left her husband. And she's sincere. Her kid is sincere. She's his mum. But to us... You can talk to her about anything! You can talk. I will listen. - You'll hear, today... - Yeah, yeah. I will listen. See if it's as good as you make out. - Deal? - Ok. Let's go. Hey, guys! Look, Anton is dancing! They're laughing! Maydanov, let's dance! Don't you want to? Anton, how about you? Let's go! Stop! I'll explain everything. Just let us dance for a bit! We're having an intellectual break. Quiet! Interview time! A message for your grandchildren! Did everyone understand? Tanya, lights! - Lyosha, you're taking photos. - I'm ready. - Alla, are you feeling confident? - Yes, for now. - Seryozha, how are things at home? - It's complicated. - Why? - Is it easy for you? Antosha, who do you want to be when you grow up? A tank soldier. - Tanya, who do you want to be? - You know. She wants to be the new Tatyana Doronina. Lyosha... What do you want to do? To earn lots of money... So that my mum can stop worrying. And to live my life with no regrets. That's it. - Nika, do you like yourself? - No. You must have moments when you're happy with everything? Sometimes, but not really. - Ok. How about you? - I'm not complaining. - Good. - Yul'ka, do you want to get married? Married? No, I don't! - And children? - Yes, five! Interesting! How is she going to have kids without a husband? - What a strange question! - Marina Maksimovna, - Do you like our school? - Until now, yes. Yeah, it was better under Serafima. Is Emma Pavlovna a good teacher? I don't understand... Andrey knows chemistry better than her... I don't even want to compare. She's not good at solving problems. She's afraid of Andrey, so she always kicks him out. It's his own fault. She isn't that mean. Mrs Calvary can be alright. - What did you call her? - Calvary. She says that coming to our class is like going to the Calvary. Strange sense of humour... What have you done to her? You know, I really need to know chemistry... - but I have to teach myself. - Andrey. I'm not saying that every teacher should be like you, - but they should be a professional. - Stop it, Andrey. - Don't. - Why? It's the truth. - I know, it's uncomfortable. - So why are you talking about it? Who else can I talk to? - You're a fool, Andrey. - You're a fool, Andrey! I told you all teachers are the same! Ok, Maydanov. I will stand up at the next teachers' meeting and say, 'This is my and my pupils' opinion on the chemistry teacher'. Right? - Mum, I want to sit with you! - Come here, then. Marina Maksimovna, do you like our new headmaster? Nobody warned me there'd be an exam! I'm not prepared! Do you like him as a person? What do you mean, 'like or dislike'? He's not a candidate for the post he is the current headmaster. May be I wouldn't have chosen him myself... But you can't just talk about people like that! Yesterday, in the staff room there were so many questions... 'Who is his wife? How many children?' Actually, it's dark now. Your parents must be waiting. Let's go back! No, Marina Maksimovna. We're not kids anymore. - Yulya, you're wasting batteries. - Are we still recording? Let it record. We'll have something to remember. Let's sing our usual song! Let us exclaim, Let us admire each other, We shouldn't be afraid to use the words of grandeur, Let's give each other compliments, For these are the happy moments of love. Let us be free to cry, Sometimes together, Sometimes alone, And sometimes taking turns. Let's not take evil words to heart, For sadness is love's closest neighbour. Let's try to understand each other with little need for words, So that we don't make the same mistake twice. Let's always help each other, especially since life, is so very, very short. Careful... Yes? Good evening! Congratulations! What is it? He was busy - we've only just returned from the countryside. No, nobody kidnapped her. That sounds like it's my parents... Claudia Petrovna, I didn't know... I'm really sorry that this happened. But we did have a good day! I promise that she will be home in 20 minutes. What is she saying? Ok... I understand you must be angry right now. Ok, we will talk about this another time. Goodbye. - Yulya! - What? Why didn't you say you have guests at home? I didn't want to.... Your son got changed. She invited them, so she can celebrate with them. Andrey, can you take her home? - What am I going to do there? - Stop being rude, Yul'ka. Your mum got you your cassette player, your fur coat... Yeah, thanks, Mum. Don't touch me! Marina Maksimovna, I would have died from boredom! They are your parents. Do I need to say more? - Go home. - Can I put Anton to bed? - I'll do it myself! - Marina Maksimovna... Yulya, go home! I have nothing more to say to you. You know, family matters are private. You should deal with your parents yourself. Instead of giving them a heart attack! You're still here? Andrey, I asked you before! Thank you, that's enough. It's been a long day already. Especially thanks to me? Yulya, nobody is interested in your hysterics. You're grown up - you are seventeen! You're old enough to deal with your parents yourself! - Close the door. - Goodbye! - Goodbye. - Marina Maksimovna, - Yes? - Are you going to worry now? No, Alyosha, I will start worrying tomorrow. Marina Maksimovna, please, don't worry. Ok. Goodbye! - Goodbye. - Shut the door on your way out. Well, big guys? - In the corridor again? - My ears are hurting. He's lying. I hit him on the head, so the teacher kicked us out. You hit him? You shouldn't do that, especially on the head. And you spending time in the corridor, is making the school look really bad. - May I come in, Kiril Alekseyevich? - Yes, go ahead. - Hello. - Hello... Could you cancel your lesson for me? Why? What happened? I really want to take the guys to Moyka. Today is the anniversary of Pushkin's death. And my pupils haven't been there before. We teach Pushkin in 8th grade... I'm taking year 8 pupils and I want mine to come along, too. - May I? - Yes. You're letting them have too much cake. No, it's bread. Bread is good for you. Hello? Is this the institute? - Surname? - Maydanov. In our driving and military preparation lessons, Maydanov will be the prefect. Give the command to line up. Everyone line up! Smorodin! Faster! I realised that music takes people to new heights... it's a long journey, but you'll get there eventually like Tolstoy... Let's begin our driving lesson. - What are these new heights? - I think that driving is... an important part of... the general preparation... for future defenders of the motherland. - Lyosha, he's a sherriff. - As if! It thus follows... well, you can tell me this. What follows? I have bad eyesight. - Ah, the 'inadequate person'. - Yes, I think that's me. - Are you free from military service? - No. But I would be dangerous behind the wheel... Aleksey will get all As and will go to university. We can't be certain about that just yet. What about Article 132 of the USSR Constitution? The Article says nothing about my dreams... and if required, I will carry out my duty no worse than others. May be even better. Good, that's what I wanted to hear. And everything has a cure. In the journal 'Life and Science', from 19... 1968. Issue number 4. There's an article. An ancient Indian exercise to strengthen the eyes. Would you like me to show it to you? If it's not too difficult for you... Did you get it? Repeat! Just like that. Great! Then you will be an adequate person. My eyesight was almost as bad, but now I can see everything! Line up! Straight! - Maydanov, come here! - Yes! Tell your comrades which rules... you broke when you decided to sit behind the wheel. Ok, I decided to sit in the driver's seat without an instructor... Sasha Maydanov, I would like it if you came as well. I think you'll find it interesting. Let's go! What about you? Are you coming? Aleksander Sergeyevich is well, He is feeling splendid! The wheel is turning in the windmill, His pain has long now ended. A woman waits for him at home, The skylarks's song is in the air, And just a ten-minute ride away, Is where you'll find the nearest fair. He has a first-class skill, Well-spoken like the devil, His mind's as sharp as his own quill, and everything is simple. He lived in Odessa, he's been to the Crimea, He took a carriage all the way, And he was loved enough to be lent money Right up until his dying day. Gendarmes-the quiet and polite, despite fatigue playing its part, had nonetheless to their delight learned all his poems off by heart. The Tsar himself invited him, and as some of you may know it, he wished to talk about this and that... with such a distinguished poet. He was in love with beautiful women, A love that holds no ransom, And he was even killed, By a gentleman so handsome. He knew how to put things on paper, beside the candle's shimmer, He truly had something to die for, That day, by the Black River. A.S.Pushkin's Apartment - Museum But his dreams are as light as air, As if he were a child - All babbling and nonsense His rhymes are innocent and simple, He feels no shame for any of these thoughts. What joy is found in every union of consonants and vowels, This is not profit-seeking! And who invented poetry?! Such joy - to chew the end of your own quill! To agree with oneself, if only for a short while, To be surprised by one's own mind! To whom should I read it? To Anisiya or Anastasia? Oh Pushkin, it doesn't matter! Keep writing 'til after midnight, and stay asleep 'til after midday, Be happy, and keep talking in your sleep, Thank God - you're free, in Boldino, in quarantine! In this pandemonium And everchanging life, A kind genius may live Only for a short while, Sharing his gift with everyone. This waste of talent Can't be stopped. He has the whole world in his palm, Making a path through the dense forest of experience. Our guests were offended. Nobody could understand it. She came back at 11pm. She was completely wet. She had nephritis before... But that's not what I came here to talk about. I understand that she has a young child - that's wonderful, but my daughter is not his nanny. She's in 10th grade and yet she manages to do everything she wants. But if I or her father ask her to do something, she says that she has too much homework. - She does nothing? - Absolutely nothing. What do they talk about on Saturdays? Ok, so may be I'm out of touch with the school, but you are the new headmaster. You must be informed. - What problems are they solving? - I understand... You think that Marina Maksimovna is a bad role model... I don't 'think', I know. She returns from these gatherings... as a completely different person. They can't be doing anything bad there, Claudia Petrovna. May be it helps her development... But myself and my husband are against it. - At least this kind of development. - They must really love her... I haven't been here long, but I do think that she is loved. And, forgive me, I think that you are slightly jealous of this. - Don't make me laugh! - I mean it. I understand you completely. I am a parent myself. I have a daughter. It's hard to deal with her sometimes. Honest. You are absolutely right to feel this way. We understand you. Yes, yes - we understand. It's just stress. Everyone is stressed right now. But you shouldn't get upset like this. This isn't just a feeling, or an emotion. If you think that this is just emotion, you need some facts. There you go... Daylight, Twilight... 'Where is the romace?', Asks the reader. There is no hero, There is no love. Apart from that, we have everything. October blows through the neighbourhood, This means that... He who loves the sadness and the sparkle of Autumn, Is coming back towards the candlelight in my window. The leaves keep falling in the prehistoric garden, My heart is numb from this bleeding love, The fallen leaves are burnt, A sister's brother, farewell forever! Under the moonlight, Another lover... Avoids the darkness, taking light footsteps on the ice, And approaches my house. To him and only him I'll say 'I love you', Wake up, curious reader! And shout: 'Is his love for you as bright as the moonlight?' Not at all. Wish I could lie but I cannot. It hurts to say that he's in love with the brother's sister. I am in love And she is loved, Here is the dark twist in this plot. Ah, it is no coincedence that she reminded me of Anna Kern! During our sad evenings together, I tell him, You have been killed by an evil man! You were recreated from my life, and from my love! If this is who you really are, I'll send you back! He's silent, thinking: 'Could she be writing poetry right now?' And so, for many centuries now, We fall in love in the wrong order. Two hearts are travelling without their match, two lonely boats. Keeping the poem's metre going by the great sadness that is love. The anniversary of Pushkin's death... is celebrated like that of no other Russian writer... every year. Today, for the 139th time, people have gathered outside this house. And just as in 1837, those who have gathered here today have the same feelings of sadness and loss. - And children? - Yes, five! This is just awful. Five? - Tanya, who do you want to be? - You know. She wants to be the new Tatyana Doronina. Really funny... Lyosha, what do you want? - To earn lots of money... - Earn lots of money! Is this your daughter's cassette player? Yes, we gave it to her for her birthday. Kiril Alekseyevich, there's a delivery of equipment outside. Claudia Petrovna, please excuse us for a minute... Could you sign for it? Excuse me for a moment, Claudia Petrovna... Kiril Alekseyevich, I'm worried. I had no idea things were this bad! You saw her mother. She's capable of anything. She'll take that tape and go all the way to the authorities... Can you imagine the consequences? For the school, for Marina... We can't listen to the tape without Marina Maksimovna. That wouldn't be good. Kiril Alekseyevich, I've been working here for almost 32 years. I don't want to be an old witch complaining against youth. - What can I do? - We must hear all of it. I can't. It's impossible. It's the same as peeping through a keyhole. These people had no idea that we would hear their words. We can't! We must know what we are dealing with! That's all. We already know that. Let's go. Claudia Petrovna, please excuse us. As you can see, we are so busy! You know, this is a difficult question to deal with straight away... Could you... let us keep this cassette player for a short while? With the tape? Of course. I trust we have the same aim? Thank you. How do you turn it on? - Like this. - So this is off, and this is on? - Thank you for your warning. - This isn't a warning. Thank you for trusting us. - Will any of this affect Yu... - No! - No. - I would ask that it wouldn't. Don't worry. The headmaster is nervous. Yes... - May I stay until the break finishes? - Yes, of course. Olga Denisovna, the headmaster isn't... involved with Marina, by any chance? Claudia Petrovna, I didn't expect that from you. No, you misunderstood... Hello. Thank you, Kiril Alekseyevich. Everyone really enjoyed it! Guys, I think that player belongs to our mutual friend... How did it get there? Who's not here? Anvarov, Sharov, Sisoyev... - Smorodin. - Sharov isn't here? Thank god, we can take a break from his genius. So, why is my desk so messy? I ruined my new dress! - Can we come in? - Guess it was too early to celebrate. Sharov, I marked you down as absent. So... you can either leave or sit quietly for the rest of the lesson. It's easier for you to raise my grade, than it is for me to grow.. - Gills and start making caviar... - It's started again... sit down. Susoyev, come to the front. Can I do it instead, Emma Pavlovna? - Bayushkina, to the front! - I did it during the last lesson! Susoyev is going to solve a problem. Bayushkina is going to tell us more about benzene. Everyone pay attention! Bezene is a liquid. Insoluble. Colourless. With a very specific odour. What can they say? We spoke the truth and it was in our right. You see, the answers were too honest... - Smorodin! - Go away! You should have asked those questions at the right time and place. It wasn't meant for the recording... Yul'ka... Very smart. And that is benzene. Its chemical structure was first described by Kekule in 1865. His formula wasn't entirely accurate... He said that there are alternating single and double bonds. This is wrong. H6! Don't tell him - he knows it all himself! - And so, benzene... - Alright, that will do. Susoyev - B, Bayushkina - C. Put your diaries on my desk. - I left my diary at home! - You always do. - Emma Pavlovna! - You're not in today! That's subjective idealism. I can't be absent, if I'm here. Emma Pavlovna, why did you give them a B and a C? - Everything was correct! - When will this end? It makes no sense... He solved the problem. Leave the room! - Why? - You always kick him out! I said, leave the room! I want to ask you now, why do you have to make it so difficult?! What have I done? I only... I wish only the best for all of you. I can leave this job and work as a pharmacist at any time! Yeah, yeah... You go and do that... Sit down. I'll sit in on your lesson. If that's alright with you, Emma Pavlovna. Yes, of course. You came here just in time. Except... there won't be a lesson, Kiril Alekseyevich... until Sharov leaves the room. I told you already - he is an intellectual hooligan. It's either me or him. Sharov, go and take a walk. Goodbye, Emma Pavlovna. Take a seat, Kiril Alekseyevich. There's a space over there as Anvarov is absent today. So, today's topic is... The Mechanism of a Substitution Reaction taking saturated hydrocarbons as an example. What is it? - May I leave? - No. This is an important topic, especially for you, Maydanov. - Sit down. - So, it's like this? I'm leaving anyway. You see? No worries. Please, continue, Emma Pavlovna. - Could you please repeat that? - I repeat... The Mechanism of a Substitution Reaction, taking hydrated... taking saturated hydrocarbons as an example. Write it down! It's unprofessional... What are you doing here? Get out! She can't do that. You know quite a bit, don't you? - Without this. - Yeah... You wanted to test Marina, see what happened now? Right, you distract Alina, and I'm going to the headmaster's office. Wait, I need to think about this. We don't need to think, we need to act! We do need to act... but it feels like stealing. Stop being a baby. Whose player is it? Yul'ka's. So we'll give it back to her. Ok, then. Listen, you distract Alina... - How? - Easily. Make something up. Say that you need to tell her something. What if she doesn't come with me? She will. Like the thread follows the needle. She's had a thing for you for a while now. - What? - Didn't you know? You're young. And handsome as a god. So, let's go? Andey, are we leaving or not? - Yul'! - What do you want? Have you lost something recently? - No. What is it? - Is this yours? Yes, it's mine. Where did you get it from? Well, it's no longer where I found it... - You look like a swindler... - Why are you so nasty? Can you explain to me, where you got this from? - Your mother brought this. - My mum gave this to you? What? Are you insane? Yes, if only we talked to her after her first year here, this scandal would never have happened. And the curriculum wouldn't have suffered. What do you mean? Spending less time on one writer, and more on another. The one that inspires Marina the most. Are you sure that... Serafima Osipovna would have hushed this up? Without a doubt. Oh dear, the things we have to deal with! Ok, so if we discuss this in our next teachers' meeting. What then? Excuse me, Kiril Alekseyevich, we are waiting for you! In the cantene! The cantene? I don't want to eat. Kiril Alekseyevich, don't turn down their offer. Let's go. Is this going to take long? That's completely up to you! Ok, I will need to call home and tell them that I'll be late. I don't understand anything. I mean, Maydanov, I understand... But you... This is just stealing! - I didn't expect that... - Lyosha, stop fussing about. Me? No, it's you who's making all the fuss. I was just covering for him. Covering? We're afraid! Can you see? We're all afraid. You're right. We're all afraid of something. The normal procedure for getting to know our boss. - We wanted to celebrate! - That's why we're all here! - Thank you. - Who organised this? We'll never tell you! By the way, Oleg Grigoriyevich, if I may, I want to... - be the first to say something. - I won't allow it. I want to say something myself. And forgive me... - Kiril... Alekseyevich? - Alekseyevich. Forgive me, but this toast is not about you. I want to make a toast to Serafima Osipovna, she was the Head for a very long time here. I became a teacher after the war. You all know the circumstances. I thought that it was temporary, and I looked for other jobs. But she kept on throwing away my requests for resignation. She asked me to tutor some of the weaker kids, so I did. She asked me to organise an academic competition, then I rebelled again. They broke my ammeter. 'They will make you a new one', she said. 'If you are friends.' 'And if not - then the ammeter is not the biggest thing you lost'. She was a teacher to everyone. Let's all drink to her health, because nobody deserves it more. I wish her only the best. I'm used to you being cold and unattainable, Oleg Grigoriyevich, thank you on behalf of Grandma Sima. Yes, comrades - let's drink to Grandma Sima! Everything's going to be alright! Now, Oleg Grigoriyevich, I'd like to say a few words about our new boss. To be honest, I was afraid that we'd get some frumpy person... That's what I thought. And I think that we are very lucky to have someone like Kiril Alekseyevich. You were only recently demobilized, right? - Why 'demobilized'? - Well, I don't know what it's called! You recently left the army. So I... I'd like to say that some people think that... to be a headmaster, you must be an experienced teacher. The army must have really toughened Kiril Alekseyevich! - So he's ready for anything! - Not only that, Liliya Olimpiovna. I'm just saying... When this man walked in... I knew straight away... who he was. - Here is an extempore poem... - Oh no, let's not... Oleg Grigoriyevich, you understand what I'm trying to say... Thank you, I understand. No, I understand that sometimes... people betray each other. But your own mother? Tell me, how could she do it? I dont know. 'Don't know, don't know.' You don't know. I don't know either. - You were mean to her. - How? You ran way from your birthday party... - Does she work? - No. That's crazy. She must be sat on her own, and bored... Well... I'll show her what it means to be bored. You know... I wish I had a place somewhere... and at least 50 roubles a month. You're being foolish. 50 roubles! - Yul', you can stay at mine. - No, Sanya. - I can't. - My mum won't say anything. Are you going to stay with Marina? Yul'... I can't live without you. Kiril Alekseyevich should give a speech now! Let him eat his food! You know, Kiril Alekseyevich, I make great pies. Those pies are the work of a genius! But my effort is pointless, because when we meet, all we talk about is the school!! Not everyone can forget their work once their leave their desk... Marina, you need some time for your private life! - Everyone is different. - Work is more important than family? Well, it's understandable. Oleg Grigoriyevich - more tea? Your private life and work outside the classroom coincide... You have the key to 10B, Marina. How do you do it?! You overexaggerate. They will give you the key themselves, if you try. And of course, this key can't be shared with others. - Should I bring in some music? - Yes, Kostya! - Let's liven it up a little. - Ok, I won't be long! The key is a nice metaphor, Marina. Still, tell us something about your work outside the classroom... Olga Denisovna, it's not work. It's... interaction. - Does it help? - Yes, very much. - You really think so? - Who visits you? - Alyosha Smorodin? - Yes. Polinskiy? Sharov? You see... Sharov! Please, don't say that surname in front of me. I kicked him out in front of Kiril Alekseyevich today. - Really? - Yes. - I like him. - That's why you don't notice it! Kicking a pupil out is equivalent to surrender. There are clear instructions about his. - Do continue, Marina Maksimovna. - I don't know what to say! We're studying, reading, thinking... They wrote a song, although I don't like everything about it... Good Sir, when you are homeless and feeling sad, Unbridle your horses, The arts will welcome you and keep you warm inside this tavern. - Is there more? - Wait a minute.. You must replace the word 'tavern'. It means a pub, or a joint... Someone might think you're running a pub for pupils! - Who would think that? - Anyone! - Do you mean me? - You must believe in yourself. You must believe in yourself and your pupils. We've always been afraid. You're right, Marina Maksimovna. But you shouldn't react in this way. This is an old argument, Oleg Grigoriyevich. They always say 'I hope this won't lead to anything bad'. 'I hope this won't lead to anything bad...' May be Chekhov was right to make his character a teacher? - He must've had his reasons. - These reasons still exist. Pupils drink tea at their teacher's home - 'How awful!'; They're learning to defend their opinions - 'Why not at school?' So... 'The Man in a Case'... it's about me? Thank you, Marina. - You're welcome. - That's not what we're talking about. Who's not 'in a case' here? It's just a part of our job. If I ever agree with that statement, I will leave the school. Marina, you can be an editor and teach us in your publications... I said if I ever agree. And that will never happen because I love my job. Except, it would be ridiculous if I stayed here now... - Eating pies... - Come on, Marina! - Come back, you'll regret it! - I won't. You all saw... I was trying to be friendly. - What's happened? - Nothing... I'll take full responsibility for the cassette player. No, I can't. Excuse me, Konstantin Ivanovich. Yulya, give me your player. What's it go to do with you? I'll tell you later, Konstantin Ivanovich. Ok, he will explain later. I will explain now. Right now, your teachers need some music. Bayushkina, I will take full responsibility for the equipment. Konstantin Ivanovich, this is the wrong music... Sorry. Goodbye. Why are you so quiet, Kiril Alekseyevich? In that case, I will say it. You should all know that... it's not just poems and songs that take place in this 'tavern'. - They talk about us all the time! - Olga Denisovna, please keep calm. I can't keep calm when someone is insulting me! At my age! She doesn't hide anything from them! May be she sets them against me like with Emma Pavlovna? - What? They talked about me? - I just used you as an example. - Olga Denisovna, you can whisper. - I'm not going to whisper! Don't shout at me! It's alright to eat the pies but... - Why are you shouting at me? - I didn't. I said it like it is. Everyone is so stressed. Pupils discussing their teachers! Is this really news? It's always happened, and always will! I suspect that when Socrates' pupils went home, they said something like... 'I think the old man lost his marbles today', 'or may be it's just Xanthippe driving him mad agan'. Yes. And if this didn't happen... then Socrates wouldn't have left a school and pupils, but a few pedants who couldn't go further than him in science. That's the Law of the Dialectics. Oleg Grigoriyevich, it's easy for you to say. You are respected. In that case, I'm not capable of understanding the dialectics. Should I retire because of this? Olga Denisovna... That's not what I meant, Olga Denisovna. I meant that... you... you take everything to heart. Relax, everything is going well. - Do you already have some tea? - Yes. It was a pleasure to meet you, Oleg... - Grigoriyevich. - Grigoriyevich. This is all the music I could find. Liliya Olimpiyevna, you're probably more of an expert at this than me. Oleg Grigoriyevich, something's happened in 10B... - What happened? - Something's not right. Bayushkina was crying, I asked to borrow her cassette player, but it seems like everyone wanted it. Something's wrong. - Should I sit here or over there? - Sit here. They'll sort it out by themselves. - Take my seat. - No, no - please sit down. Liliya Olimpiyevna, play something like... you know! Well, just sit here then, you idiot. Well, Marina - are you stuck? Andryush - it's not opening! This door is bad. - Could you call someone? - I know a secret. - Well? - Rouble... - What? - The secret costs 1 rouble. Get out of here! I'll tell your mother. So what? My mother got stuck before. Then after she sat there for an hour, she paid me 3 roubles! Alright, then. I'm off. It's not even 3 roubles. What do you all want from her? - Alright, stop. - Get your hands off! - Give me the player! - Do you want me to punch you? - I don't even know. - Sanya, give him the player. - Be quiet! - Stop following me! You don't understand! Why are you still at school? Bad weather, Kiril Alekseyevich. It's really windy outside. Bad weather, huh? That's it. Nothing else you have to tell me? In that case, I will talk. - You don't need to. - I don't? Why not? We think... we know what you have to say. Yulya, can you do without your player for now? Ok? Kiril Alekseyevich needs it... - Why? - Well... I think... he wants to try and understand us. We shouldn't stop him. Except... it's a strange way to try to understand us... Kiril Alekseyevich, we could tell you the same thing in your office. - And we could sing. - We'll sing. Sanya, give him the player. Maydanov... Come here. Everyone else can go home. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. You better run back home. Goodbye. There are dolphins! But a whale is even bigger. - What? - It's smaller... What are you talking about? Than a whale! - Well? - I didn't find anything! - I didn't find it! - You can't find it... - It's here, see? - I'm not playing anymore! I'm sad now. - Calm down, Anton. - Ask me nicely. I don't ask you nicely? Don't shout at me! Anton, don't dive without me there! - You? - May I come in? Please, do. - How? - The door just shuts, like this. Excuse me, my son's in the bath. I won't be long! Don't take your shoes off! Just come through. - Hello. - Hello. Who are you? I'm Kiril Alekseyevich. - And who are you? - I'm Anton. Antoshka... Is that song about you? No, that's not about me. Well? Stand up now, dolphin. Let's wash that foam off. Get rid of the foam. Come on, dolphin. Alright, I caught you now! Dolphins don't like it when you touch their fins. Who does? Nobody likes that. I don't. Say good night to Kiril Alekseyevich. Good night! Even if we wait until he leaves, how are you going to ask her to let you stay? Sort your hat out. And stop smoking. Well, are you cold? - Do I look bad? - No, you're still ok. - I told you, come to mine. My mum... - You mum is really nice. She won't ask or say anything... - I'll stay in the kitchen. - I know, Sasha, but I can't. You know, Marina Maksimovna... that because of you, I'm in a very difficult position, and so I need to ask you a few questions. Tell me, can you offend a person if you know that you are smarter, more talented, - and more up-to-date? - You can. Do you understand that you offended some people? Offended? I'm trying to deal with this situation right now. Deal with it, as you wish. - Would you like to listen? - No. In that case, I will erase everything on this tape. I don't know, Marina Maksimovna... But officers are not allowed to discuss other officers in the presence of soldiers. Even indirectly. That's professional ethics. - I hope you agree? - I agree with this. Yes, well I mean it when I say that this is a private talk. It's as if I was never here. I just came to talk. But I don't know, honestly, I don't know... Well, I didn't know how to talk to you about this. On my way here, I thought of the ways I could persuade you... I didn't like what you said... at the dinner. Even if I wasn't the headmaster, just as an ordinary person, I still wouldn't like it. Please, don't interrupt me. Just let me finish and then may be you'll understand me. I think that a person who is talented by nature, should be kind and generous. And I think that you are talented. I thought, 'How should I talk to her? I'll tell her everything...' About how I was on my own as a child during the war, how people rescued me, how my daughter doesn't understand those who rescued me, You know it already, you'll think 'Oh he's starting that again...' - So, you still want to be a teacher? - Yes, why? What a tough job. Did you decide this yourself? - Uhuh. - That's crazy. It's really... cold. And not everyone, is lucky enough to do what they love and still make money. No, not everyone. So, you agree with this as well? Kiril Alekseyevich, they asked me questions and I gave honest answers. And you'd prefer me to lie, and to lose my pupils' trust. But you can't earn trust at the cost of others... - Right? - Kiril Alekseyevich, may be it's not very modest... but still... I don't feel guilty, I feel that I'm right. Should I resign? You can think about it. I wouldn't if I were you. I wouldn't recommend it. - Let's go. - Wait... I don't know why we're just standing here. We should just go in and say everything. You're right. It's pointless standing here. What's the rush? The boss is here. Stay calm, everyone. We haven't seen him. - Let's not panic. - Yes, but he can see us. Bayushkina, come over here! Give this back to your mum, and tell her that we didn't need it. Thank you. 113 Griboyedov Street - Stop, stop. - You shouldn't go there. - Why not? - You've done your part. What have I done that's so bad? Yul'ka, it's your parents. I don't think that your parents need to go there. You know, Yul'ka, you should deal with your problems yourself. You don't need to get your parents involved. Bye! - Mum! Mum! - Yulya! - Where have you been? - Home! Now! Yulya... Let us exclaim, Let us admire each other, We shouldn't be afraid to use the words of grandeur Let's give each other compliments, For these are the happy moments of love. Hey, guys! Can you give me a push? Let us be free to cry, Sometimes alone, Sometimes together, And sometimes taking turns. Let's not take evil words to heart For sadness is love's closest neighbour. Let's try to understand each other With little need for words, So that we don't make the same mistake twice. Let's always help each other, Especially since life is so very, very short.
