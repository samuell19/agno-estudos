Land In the evolution of human civilization... ...land has played an important part As civilizations developed... ...humans wanted to produce their own food They converted forests to agricultural lands... ...making it an essential part of human consciousness Lands they toiled in became their God... ...their religious rite and a caste ritual Land became power! From our myths and epics to the present... in order to expand borders... ...and to assert power many wars are being fought The defeated side is being enslaved! Even in Independent India... land ownership land deprivation... and the social status associated with it... ...are all unwritten laws. Even after many centuries... ...this situation hasn't changed much in our villages and our cities A considerable amount of land in the cities... ...is retained by the slum dwellers through their labour and numbers. We call them the ‘Urban Poor'. They face severe oppression in this country. Corporate companies and land mafia feel that... the land of these under represented people... ...is ruining the beauty of the city That they are unclean... ...and are criminal hubs Together they conspire to evict the poor. People are removed brutally from their own land They are either thrown outside the city... ...or into match box sized housing projects They live and die with no land to call their own This happens in all our cities with all of us as the eyewitness India’s financial capital... ...Mumbai is no exception to this. 'Ready! Are we on air?' I am reporting from the open laundry in Dharavi’s 90 feet road The State assembly elections are round the corner Ruling Party Chief Haridev Abhyankar... ...announced 'Pure Mumbai’ scheme in the last term A plan to demolish tenements and construct buildings Keys to newly built houses are handed over in many places 'Puja' for the first building in Dharavi is going on now ‘Arise’, a people’s movement here is opposing this project Come along, you will see... The ‘Bhumi Puja’ is happening on one side... ...and protests by 'Arise' movement right behind This first opposition to the scheme has created an uproar among the residents Hey, what are you doing? Move Turn it off! Stop filming! Sir, CAMERA! (slogans) We wash clothes every day. We wash clothes every day! We work hard every day. We work hard every day! Our houses are ours to keep. Our houses are ours to keep! 'Our houses are ours to keep!' 'Say it loud' Start! 'Our houses are ours to keep!' 'Our rights are ours to keep.' Damn! Hey, Move! - Our rights are ours to keep! - Hey, stop - We will never give it away. - Stop I said We are the owners and we don’t have a problem What is your problem?

Dharavi is going to be filled with buildings Saving the dhobi ghat! Hey! This ‘Akka’ has been here for 20 years What would she do if there is no place to work?

Hey... No...No… I love you my dear I love you my darling I feel like crying But I won’t! Why should I? No…No…You shouldn’t cry my darling. I love you So... ...were you really in love with Perumal? It’s raining. Wow! Good rains, right? Machaan The same message is being forwarded for the 9th year now Idiots. I am receiving for the 6th time ‘Are you serious?’ We are going to do what no one else could in Dharavi? How you made fun always! Watch what we do now - Is it? - 'On my way, Madam' My dear Nephew! Is Dharavi getting a golden roof? 'Come to the Temple tomorrow' ‘Arise’ movement will lead from now on!' 'We have won the tender' Ya, ya! 'Bring the leader of your Asura clan too' - 'OK?' Ya! ‘Dharavi: Now Let’s see how this will change' 'First. Houses' '225 to 350 square feet houses' 'Not for everyone For those the Govt. qualifies...' '...in batches' 'Then, Golf Course...' '...Hospitals, Pubs, Schools' 'Your children will get free education in these schools' 'Rich kids will have a separate school' 'Hospital will be the same' 'You can avail free treatment ONLY during weekends' - Noticed the golf ground? - Superb 'Where do we get money for this?' 'Let’s sell the buildings along the main road' 'What do you think?' - That's not our sector - 'We don't want freebies' - This side - 'You think!' 'Isn't it a silent revolution for equality!' - Thank you so much - Thank you! So kind of you! - Thank you so much, Sir - Thank you so much Superb! It’s so overwhelming! Saw how our new Dharavi will look? Huh? Our Architect sir... ...and our Builder deserve a round of applause Dharavi WILL have a new name! Dharavi will be truly liberated now Yay! My friends will visit me now. Superb! Sir, why do we need a golf course? Cricket, football and kabadi are our games, right Hey! Quit blabbering Lenin! What’s wrong in what he says? 'Why do we need a golf course?' Hey! It’s ok. It’s ok Everything has to become high-class 'Otherwise, how will your friends respect you?' 'Exactly!' Your happiness... ...is our priority Zareena Ma’am is here to do exactly this This is a victory for all of us! Ey! Applaud for Hari Daada’s victory! What are you looking at? Idiots! Go on! Carry on! Louder! You will never… What are you all looking at? Vishnu can’t do anything directly So you have come in the name of change You praise him and he appreciates you! What is all this drama? Uncle, you have started your nonsense, is it? Hey! Why are you threatening him? Isn’t that the truth? Don’t you know who is Manu Builder? Selvam, don’t start off on this tangent Isn’t it enough if our job gets done? You want these people to live in this muck? Who came to us when we were in muck? 'Now...' '...we have made this place liveable' 'They come drooling' We have Bandra-Kurla complex on one side 5 railway stations around 'Commuting from Dharavi to anywhere in Mumbai is easy' That's the reason MLA sir, wait! Don’t misinterpret this This is not our motive 'Who is this halfwit?' Stadiums and golf course, it seems It takes 74 acres to build a golf course Let's say you build it in 50 acres Why should we give all that land and end up in 225 sq.ft houses? Are we idiots to exchange a goldmine for chaff? 'Ey! Stormy' Attached toilets in a house is enough, is it? Ya! You will raise buildings here Won’t Kaala’s reputation be dented? - Hey! - Ey! How will he survive then? He needs a share, Madam Give him that He will be quiet Come let’s go Non sense Stop it Stop it, I said So many Govts. So many builders But nothing has changed 'Here comes the NGO Madam!' Nothing has changed since the time I left You have concerns, you have problems? Then give it to me in writing KARIKAALAN You create a ruckus and leave without a word?! Listen, let me come straight to the issue This is our land A land that our ancestors created Ask the Government to help us We will build our houses the way we want to And keep it clean I guarantee you that We all do What do you all say? - (people agree) Govt. will do everything, is it? What will the Govt. do then? Don’t say that the Govt. is in debt ... Govt. officials and politicians live comfortably with scammed money Where did that money come from? Huh? 'On the point!' You sell this land now, right now Just the land will fetch you 400 billion! You want us to give it all up and live like losers? Hey, Rebel leader! Shut this market and come home Infuriating…! Stupid people! Give me the spanner 'Why are you breaking it? Ma, don't interfere' 'What?' Grandpa..Lenin Uncle is breaking something Let's just do our job, alright? Ey! Where are you going? Listen to me - Let me go I will slap you now Where are you going? Dei...

Don’t cry my darling Let’s change that name We will call you Vengaiyan... Not that name Take my Dad's name 'Muniyan' Ma! You think it's funny? Ganging up! Hey, are we running a show here? Get lost, I warn you It’s ok dear What? We gathered a group to do some good things He ruined it all Some nonsense or the other Ya... We are the pawns for your revolution? Why not? Are you the decision maker here? Lenin, watch your tongue! Things will go out of hand! What will you do? You will get no respect 'Don't be rude to your brother!' -What? How dare you talk back? I will slap you tight - 'Going on and on' - Wait! Relax! This is between us Hey Your lover, Stormy... Have you ever gone to her building? 15 people live in those houses. Suffocated. If we have to live the chawl life Why do we need buildings? So? Show me a place without problems! He has come to construct buildings... ...not bungalows. They come with money in mind not people's welfare How will they build good houses? Hari Daada that too… When were the rich concerned about the poor? Show me one unselfish person. Let me see? This is why.... ...you shouldn't do anything We shouldn’t do anything, is it? And you? Rowdyism is all you know YES! I am a rowdy People you support are good? With money and power rowdies become patrons! No understanding of the land and its people You read 2 books and go around muttering change and revolution Understand the basics first! Yes, sir our heads are filled with clay Selvam Anna You started it all! Poor Zareena Madam So much blood! Let them rot here! All for them and... Oh! Wow!

Listen to me, my darlings You have to be compassionate, always Let all this end with me That... That's why I lost my Selvi... ...my Captain Selvam Damn that drink! If I wasn't drunk that day... ...I wouldn't have lost them both If you keep mourning the dead who will think of the living? Aims and ambitions! Selvam didn't know any of that "I will die for my father" he would say 'That is all he wanted' It is painful, yes! But we should lose nothing anymore NOTHING! We will stand by you That's right.
