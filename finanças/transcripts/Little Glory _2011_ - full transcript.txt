[car horn honking] [male driver] Get out of the way! [man, English accent] Romance is out, bro. [second man] I just want to find the right one, man. Yeah, like Jenny found what's-her-face. Now she's good. That blonde chick from the pool hall? Seriously. With her, all you got to do is ask, mate. All you got to do is ask. You must be the last guy in this whole town who hasn't nailed her. Wait, wait, wait, Laurie Stone. She's hot. Oh, forget it. Laurie Stone? Those kinds of girls, they only go for the hummers. Well, you know there's nothing like driving a good ol' stick shift. Same all over, bro. Same all-fucking over. Now literally, those girls, they just go for the money. Like my dad and me, we just move from one shithole to the next. Yeah, but you'd still be sucking on fish and chips in your daddy's garage if it wasn't for me. Gov, if it weren't for me, you'd still be skipping school and snoozing on your Playstation. Look where that got us. Things could be worse, eh? 'Cause we're the kings of the herd now. More like kings of the car heap, bro. [clapping] Yeah! God bless America! God bless America! What the fuck are you doing, man? I'm applauding them, bro. My 1967 Ford Mustang. Shit, man, I shouldn't have quit that fucking job. Listen, bro, look at me. Dead-end job, ass-crack of the universe. You wanna look like that? Well, they look like my old man. [chuckling] Actually, I gotta fucking make some scratch, man, before he sticks his fucking Makita up my ass. See, that's the problem with the recession here. You haven't got the dole. You should move to England, bro. Yeah, like I have money for that. Listen, bro, you'll make it big easy.

It's a mistake there. It's me, by the way. [people talking, shouting in distance] Richard, come here. How's it going, man? [motorcycle passes in distance] [TV playing] [woman on TV] I actually think that maybe the White House is kind of blowing an opportunity. I, quite frankly, don't think the White House is doing a very good job of communicating-- God damn. [changes channels] I went to the DHS today. They wouldn't give me a dime. Can you loan me some money? [man on TV] Harris still on his feet at the 45. God, you call that throwing a pass? Yeah, well, I don't play in the NFL. So I'm gonna need some money. What? Dad! What is it, Shawn? What do you want? I said I went to the DHS today. They wouldn't give me any money. I need money. What the hell did you go to the DHS for? That's just for losers. It was stupid to lose that last job you had. Why don't you just go out and get yourself another? I never begged for anything in my life. Hey. Don't touch the soda. My money, my soda. Get it, dumb shit? You say "shit" a lot, Dad. Go to your room, Julie. Ow. Aah! Look at you. You wanna fight me, boy, huh? You want me to teach you a lesson in front of her? You're nothing. You're scum. What? Your mother's not here to defend you? Put the cap on the soda. You can pack up your shit and get out. And don't go anywhere near my truck!

I can't get to the phone right now, so please leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Have a nice day. [beep] I, um... I just wanted to-- I just wanted to say good night. Good night. [yelps] [barks] Richard! [urinating] [barking] [kicking] [yelps] Hey, jerk-off. You shouldn't hit dogs, jerk-off. What?You shouldn't hit 'em. They're the weaker species, asshole. Hey. Fuck off. Say that again? Are you knitting? No. Shit. My bad. I can see you're writing fancy words. Are you a poet or something? What's your name, poem girl? Jessica. Oh, like Jessica Alba? No, like Jessica, jerk-off. Where do you live? I'll walk you home. Here, take my jacket. It's gonna rain. What rain? Never mind, just take it. You know, you wouldn't want to ruin your poem. What's your number? Hell no. How am I gonna get my jacket back? I'll get it back to you. But you don't even know where I live. Fuck. Hey, Bill, you sure you're all right? Fuck off. [man] Ah, there he is. I was wondering what was up with the disappearing act. Must be that time of the month, huh? Speaking of, my old lady, she likes to nag. Now what's that about? Nag about this, bitch about that. Just like the football game last week. Then I'm coming home from Fatty's last night. She tries to tear me a new asshole. What am I supposed to do? You know what, I got a mind to-- Bill? Bill! Bill! A man down! A man down! [man] Call an ambulance! [Richard barking] [chatting, indistinct] Lay it off, Larry. This ain't on you. I'm sick of you guys. I won. I won the race. [telephone ringing] Oh, yeah! Look at that. [ringing] [ringing][chatting] Yo, shut up.[ringing] Hello? Yeah. All right. Bye. [chatting, indistinct] Oh, bitch slap, bitch slap. So, what's up? What was that? Uh, my dad, he, uh... he had an accident at work. He's dead. You're shitting me, man. What do you want to do, man? You want to go there? Let's just play another race. Man, what the fuck? Your dad's dead. You're just scared of losing again. [Julie] What's going on? Dad died. Like Mom? Yeah. Like Mom. [voice on video game] Impact! [voices on game, indistinct] [door closes] Come and get me, you bowling ball. [TV playing] Go to your bed. [man on TV] If you stay with us, we've got action director Martin Campbell coming on. Yeah! We've got Angelina Jolie, the beautiful Angelina Jolie. And for your entertainment purposes, we have the Kings of Leon! That's right. Fantastic. Well, stick with us. We'll be back with you right after the break! How come we're sitting here? What's wrong with here? Aren't we going to be late? This ain't the kind of thing that starts without us. Why isn't Richard coming? So he doesn't take a dump in the coffin. You ever seen a dog at a funeral? I've never seen a funeral. What about Mom? Yeah, that was a funeral. You look like the president in that shirt. Thanks. Let's go. What about me? Am I pretty? Last night I found my old man's will and life insurance policy. Says it's worth 100 grand. What's the catch? Well, it's in my sister's name. Figures. No kidding. He just gave me his truck. Fucking bastard. [laughing] What the fuck happened there? That pisses me off, bro. Bit of a cock-up, so I get angry. Fuck up my pretty hands. That's fucked up, Matt. You good? Yeah, yeah. I could use a fucking drink, though, that's for sure. [chatting, indistinct] [man] I had no idea Bill was in such dire shape. [woman] Anna's death didn't help. As far as I can remember, he was always a total wreck. [man] Yeah, it's pretty awful for the kids. I mean, what's going to happen to Julie? [woman] I'm going to take her. I'd help if I could. I filed a petition for the guardianship at the probate court. That poor little thing can't stay here. Did you hear what we were saying? Your aunt asked you a question. I'm sorry, Shawn, but you know it's true. So that's why you're doing all this, right? Helping out with the funeral? You're just thinking about the money, right? A hundred grand? What are you talking about? I'm going to take care of my sister. What, are you fucking nuts? I'll take care of Julie. I'm not giving her away to nobody. I can file papers, too. Right, Jul? Can you do a handstand? How will you manage, Shawn? She goes back to school tomorrow. Will you get up and drive her to school? When was the last time you woke up before 10:00? I'm leaving. [airplane flying overhead] [woman] Hello. Thank you for calling. I can't get to the phone right now, so please leave me a message and I'll get back to you. Have a nice day. [beep] Hey, jerk-off. How's it going? I tore it. I was kidding. Don't you ever laugh, jerk-off? My, uh... My dad's, uh-- I know. My cat's gone. Shitty day. I think you should go. ♪♪ Shit! Julie! Get up! Yo! Julie! They're dirty! We don't have time. You can wear 'em again. I don't want to. You've got 30 seconds. [Julie] Can't go to school without eating. It's not fair. I won't feel good. [Shawn] Don't piss me off. It's not important to eat. Go. [both laughing] Oh, fuck. What? It's my boss. Dalcos. So what? What'd you do, you steal his favorite dildo? I don't know, man. I just don't like seeing him, that's all. Bro, can you ever find your balls when you reach for them? What are you doing in here now? You really are-- Oh, my God. I'd like to buy some jewelry, for a girl. What's the occasion? She wore earrings the first time. Oh. You know, well, these are beautiful. They're white gold. They're $399. All right. I'll take 'em. Great. [kisses] Hey. [whistles] I'm sorry, your card's been refused. It's blocked. Do you have another one? Yeah. Just a second. Okay. My dad's card's blocked. What? My dad's card, it's blocked. It's not 'cause you got his ATM card that there's cash in the account, right? Oh, no way. No, no. No way. Come on, man. No way. I don't want her to think I'm a nothing. My sister's about to hit the jackpot with the old man's life insurance and... I'll get you your money back. Come on, man. Please? You just want to get laid? All right. Sort yourself out with that. Give me the rest back and the rest even quicker, all right? Give it back quick. You get me? That's why you wanted me to come over? Put them on. That's very sweet, but, um... I never wear any. I'm oversensitive. I bleed easily. Well, you can exchange them, right? It's not like your finger's oversensitive. I don't want any gifts. [Julie] Shawn! Shawn! Don't worry about it. [Julie] Shawn! She's crying. [sighs] What is it, Julie? I had a bad dream. Mom and Dad were coming to get me. They wanted me to go with them up there. It was a bad dream.I need my gun. [Julie] Shawn! [sighs] Shawn! Aah! Shawn! Shawn! What? What-- What is it now? Why'd you shut the door? So the monsters wouldn't come in. It wasn't monsters, it was Mom and Dad. Can you stay with me? I gotta go. Don't shut the door, Shawn! Only if you stop screaming, okay? Please, lower your gun. Spare my life. All right. Can I go now? I didn't need it. "Cujo?" C-U... [chuckles] Jerk-off. [sighs] Fuck. [dramatic music playing on TV] For heaven's sakes, get that guilty look off your face. I lost your umbrella. I gave you the flu. [woman on TV] Don't be silly. It was raining. I got wet, so I got the flu. [phone beeping] [beeping] Yo. [clears throat] Shawny. So, did you score? Yeah, all the way, man. Good investment then, bro. Hey, what's that there? Are you watching porn? No, it's just some... it's just some, uh, action flick. Ha ha. You know "Rambo 7" or something like that. Yeah, I guess building up the courage for tomorrow, right? Well, peace out, bro. One thing I learned these last weeks: I love you. [groaning] [yawning] [door creaking open] [toilet flushing] This hearing concerns the guardianship of Julie Bennett. I assume that is you, young lady. Is that correct? Okay. Yeah, and I'm her brother. I understand. Please take off your hat. The petition was filed by the maternal aunt, Miss Monica Wabski. And then a second petition was filed by Shawn Bennett, the child's brother. Mr. Bennett, do you feel you can raise your sister on your own? Let's see, you are 19. Okay. How will that work? I'm sure it will work fine. I mean, we get along real well. She knows who's boss now. Everything's dandy. Anything else? Well, I mean, as soon as we get the money from my dad's life insurance, we'll be fine. Well, things don't work out thanks to money alone, young man. What is your occupation? Cabinet-making jobs are hard to come by. So, uh, I don't have a... full-time job right now. And you, ma'am, what is your take on the situation? Well, he never took care of himself, so I don't see how he's going to take care of Julie. And you are employed as a CPA? And unmarried?That's right. But this would make me more available for Julie. She's not even American. I was naturalized 15 years ago. Do you have anything else to say, Mr. Bennett? Does my sister stay with me or not? I am going to appoint a guardian ad litem from the child advocacy team. Now this lawyer will visit your homes. He or she will then make a recommendation to me as to what they feel is in Julie's best interests. And I will make my decision in one month's time. Until then, the child shall remain in her home. But, Your Honor-- Madam, I understand your concern, but I don't feel that there's any eminent danger. This may be the last few weeks she spends there. It's a needed transition. Yeah, but- I don't--Young man, I advise you to save your energy to convince me that you can take care of this little girl. I will see you in a month. [pounds gavel] Come on, let's go. [TV playing] [Shawn sighing] Go to bed, Julie Bean. What are you doing? I'm popping zits. What's zit? All right. Well, see those? Yeah. Those are red ones. You can't pop 'em, but they hurt if you scratch 'em. And that... See all those? Those are blackheads. They're like an army. Snakes come out of 'em. Snakes? Not big ones. Little yellow ones. What are they for? Um, to make girls think we're ugly. I think you're handsome. You're going out? I'm afraid when I'm alone in the house. Don't worry, all right, Julie? I'm here, Richard's here, all right? It's time to go to bed now.

It's not important to eat. Hello? [woman] Hello. I'm with the Child Advocacy Service. I'm calling in regards to Julie's guardianship. [hammering, pounding] [men chatting] You want to talk to me? So, uh, how's it coming along? It's coming. What do you want? Uh, it's, uh... It's about the accident. Hmm. Money. Yeah. I know there's a compensation for accidents on the job. That's true. So how much are we going to get? Nothing. Wait, I thought you said it was an accident. Yeah, well, I was being nice. Your father was shitfaced. His comp fell off the ladder right along with him. What'd you think, he was drinking lemonade all day, kid? ♪♪ For you and Julie. No need. I just want to help. So nowyou want to help. Well, when would I? Before? When our mom died? We could have used your special little meals. We could have used you. Look, she likes this. It's my special stew. Tell her. I canhelp you. Monica. [phone vibrating] [Shawn] Mom? [Julie] Shawn? Is that you? Shawn. Shawn. [closes phone] What are we eating tomorrow? Chicken again? I thought you liked chicken. We'll eat something else tomorrow. Really?Yeah, I'll eat whatever you can cook. Why did Dad die? I don't know. Why did they both die? It seems so, well, weird. [TV playing] [character on TV] Okay, get ready for the return trip to the past. [TV continues] Turn that off and go to bed. Julie, go to bed. I'll go to bed when I want to. Okay, now that was funny. Now, let's go! God damn it, let's go! Fine! Do whatever you want! I don't give a shit! You wanna know why Dad died? Because you kept giving him all that beer, and he drank so much that he died! Shit. Julie, I'm sorry. I just-- I don't want to live here anymore. I want to live with Aunt Monica. Wait, what? I want to live with Aunt Monica! Put down that phone! Now! I hate you! I want to live with Aunt Monica. The only place you're going is your room! I hate you! You got that? Turn off the TV and go to your room. I said enough with the TV! God damn it! Fuck! [crashing] Julie, can you please go to your room? Otherwise you'll be too tired for school tomorrow. Aren't you going to say good night? Hey. Julie, it wasn't your fault, okay? That's not why Dad died. You were just being sweet, that's all. It's not your fault, okay, Jul? [sighs] Oh, fuck. Julie! Julie, come here, now! [doorbell rings] Jessica, I need you to make something to eat. Anything. [Jessica] Are you kidding? The bitch from Child Services is here. Isn't it dinnertime? While she's here, grab the containers out of the garbage can. [knock on door] What? Hi. Hi. I'm Cynthia Rabiner from the Child Advocacy team. I called last week? Come on in. This is my sister, Julie, and Jessica. She's making dinner. I'm just going to take a quick look around. Go ahead, ma'am. I'm just going to help my sister with her homework. So, did you solve that triangle problem yet? It's grammar. Well, it's still a problem, isn't it? Is he dangerous? Richard? No, no, he's not. Hey. Come here. Come here. Who does the cleaning around here? Uh, well, my mom used to, but I guess you know she died. What about you? Are you afraid of the dog? Yeah, I am. When they lock me up in the closet with Richard, and he hasn't eaten for months and years, then I'm scared, lady. [chuckles nervously] Kids say the funniest things. Don't they? Where's Julie's bedroom? Last door. At the end of the hall. They're pretty old, aren't they? Julie likes playing with those. How lovely. I haven't seen one of these in years. Yeah, she loves trees and plants and shi-- uh, and stuff. She goes to sleep with a stuffed animal. She doesn't sleep with me. Mr. Fish and Chips over here. Do they even have that kind of stuff in the UK? No, we don't, but these are my favorite. [laughing] Fuck, man. It's tasty, though. It's good shit though, right, Julie? Yeah. It's cool she doesn't talk much. My sister, when she was her age, she never stopped yapping. So why aren't you eating? My mom's making lasagna tonight. You didn't invite me, you dick. Speaking of yapping, you ever fuck one that never shut up? You did? Did once. What, couldn't get it up? Exactly, bro. [laughing] She just went on and on and on. So we get fucking, then, and she goes on and on and on. So I fucking flip her over, stick her panties in her mouth, fucking-- [laughing] [laughing] [laughing] What the fuck was that?

But, well, Julie loves nature, you know? She's been talking about this trip a lot this year. You didn't tell me about a school trip. I don't need to go. Anyway, it's all muddy there. But, Julie-- It's all muddy there! You're gonna go, all right? Okay with me, but only if you do me first. I mean, I got to. Wow, thanks. That shows you really like me. Then also it hurts less if you do that first. For how long? Five minutes. What? I can't hold my breath that long. If you're nice, I'll let you up for air, like, once. Thanks. You better keep your cell phone turned off. You don't want to film us so you can show your girls you got me sprung? I don't kiss and tell. That woman's staring at us like we stole her car. Oh, shit.

I-I can take care of here, you know? Do you really think I'd leave her at home alone? [engines revving on video game] [door closes] How's first base going, Princess? So how'd it go with Julie? Eh. Is she sleeping? [knock on door] Come in. Hey, why aren't you asleep? Your friend. Yeah, what about him? I don't want to tell you. Well, don't tell me, then. He slapped me. He hit me. Wait, what? Why would he do that? I didn't want to watch what he was watching. So? Doesn't mean he can hit me. Well, you had to have done something. A slap isn't such a big thing. So? Not everybody can hit me. Dad could. Maybe you could, if you wanna. But not everybody can hit me. Dad never hit you. Yo, why'd you hit Julie? She was trying to switch channels. Well, I want you to go and apologize to her. Fuck that. I'm on this game right now. Matt! Shut the fuck up. Fuck you! [Richard barking] Never touch my sister, ever! [barking] Better watch your back, motherfucker! You are not safe! Back the fuck off! You are not safe. [Richard barking] [Matt barking] I'm thirsty. [sighs] Okay. I lost your earrings. I dropped them. They went down the drain. I didn't mean to. I'm not mad, okay? Just go back to bed, please. I need a hug. [sighs] [sighs] Sure. Well... [Julie] Hey, Richard. I had a half-day today. [door opens] I'm home! I've got half-days every Wednesday. All year. Aren't you going to make lunch? No, not really. I'm hungry. Right. Let's make spaghetti. You know how to make spaghetti? You don't know how to make spaghetti? Sure I do. Wait, you stay there. Don't come in. Don't look. At least let me help. No, I'm fine! You can look now. Oh, wow. Great sauce, huh? Yeah, you didn't do too bad. So, how'd you even learn how to cook? I used to watch Mom. Be right back, okay? Stay here. What the hell are you doing here? Hey, isn't your dad supposed to take care of that? Yeah, well, fuck him. I nick it, I sell it. No hard feelings, then? Yo, so when's the next run? No way. We're not going back there. Not with all those dodgy geezers around, mate. It's too risky. Besides, it don't pay. But on the other hand, I went back there-- Wait-- No, no, no, no, no. Not to get the stupid car parts. I've been down there to see the dogs. The dogs? Dog fights. We could make us a good chunk of gold, mate. With that kind of money, you could send your sister on all the dumb-ass school trips she wants. How much we talking? [snaps fingers] Are you fucking crazy, man? Richard's never attacked anyone. He'd get eaten by a fucking poodle. Listen, I want my money, and I want it quick, all right? Three days. You get it or else you're dead, you get that? That's my rules. That's the way I get paid back, friends or no friends. No hard feelings then, huh? Fuck. Is that new? It's from Monica. She said she wasn't playing with it anymore. Just chill here, okay? And stay away from the machines. What the hell you want? I need you to sign this. So you want me to help you keep your sister. What have you done for me lately besides walk out on your job? Look, my mother died. I was in shock. I mean, that was it. That's too easy. I think you're just a quitter. Yo, all I need you to do is sign this stupid letter of recommendation. I'll figure it out. Just forget about it. You can't even hack an entry-level job, and you want to raise a kid? Why don't you just come back to work? People do work and take care of kids. That's what grown-ups do. Remember how you couldn't be bothered with this? Yeah. I want you to cut this for me. If you can do it, I'll sign your damn paper. [chuckles] This pattern is almost impossible. I mean, you'd have to do it in one go. Yeah. In one go. One single go.

Like, not going to be able to meet you tonight. Wait a second, put him on the phone now. All right. Good-bye. That's it, bro. Play on. Right, I'm busy tonight. Exactly. Dude. Has she been giving you a blow job? How you doing, ladies? All right? You enjoying the show? You know, you've got to pay to watch us play, though. Right, Tony?That's right. And it just so happens that you two have got the two best seats in the whole fucking house. Oh, yeah? Uh-huh. So what's it gonna cost? Well, that would be depending on the payment. Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Oh, she wants it, too? All right, all right, all right. Calm down. Calm down. There a problem here? Yeah? Well, maybe there is. [imitates gun cocking] What the hell's that?[imitates gun firing] Lie down, fool. What? You're dead. Think I'd be miming if I wasn't strapped? You know what? Let's just walk out. Fhooo. [laughing] [imitates gun firing] Ha. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Shawn, she's asleep. I don't believe you. You're the one who wanted an evening to yourself. She--she's my sister and all. Go. Sleep it off. She needs it to sleep with. I just... I just came to give it to her. I'm calling the police. Julie! She's got school tomorrow! Do you want her to see you like this? If the police come, you'll never get the guardianship. Who cares about the fucking guardianship? Go ahead. Call the fucking cops. I don't give a fuck about the guardianship! Shit, the cops? Are you threatening me? I just did it to fucking get the 100 grand, man. Cash in on that cocksucker's life insurance! Don't you get that, you old hag? I don't give a fuck about the guardianship! About her! Go, Shawn. Fuck you. Shawny. This is Phil. He's into canine games. Oi. You got a better idea? Want to start dealing meth like the other East End bell-ends? I tell you, this is better than that is. I'm not putting my dog in this. That's exactly why nothing is going to happen to him, yeah? It's just going to be one fight. Plus, it'll be fixed. We make the other dog drowsy. Yeah, we give him itsy, teeny-weeny little fucking shot right before the match. Just enough so that Richard comes out on top. It's like stealing candy from a fucking baby, bro. We walk in, pocket the green, fuck off. Yeah, but what fool would fucking drug their own dog? He would. 'Cause he's in on it, Sherlock. He'll take his cut, don't worry. Listen, you get enough to pay me back with interest, plus you get enough scratch to take care of your sister for a while. Well, boys, I gotta get out of here. School's out. Duty calls. You do that, Super Mum. Peace. My aunt picked Julie up? Yes, she did. You didn't know? Oh, fucking-- Look, I'm really sorry, but the deadline is up for the school trip. Tomorrow. You'll have the money tomorrow. I made this promise to Julie. You'll have the money tomorrow. Bullshit. I'll call the cops if you don't let me take her. Listen, I know you're stealing from a scrapyard with your friend. And you want to take care of Julie? She doesn't need a brother in prison. You spying on me, Monica? No. I just want you to be careful, for your own sake and for Julie. I won't tell, don't worry. But don't be stupid. Whatever. The judge will decide. That's right. One more week. Hey, Julie. What's up? Hey. Julie, aren't you gonna say hi? [door creaking open] He's my old teddy bear. He's a real old-timer. He's a good guy. [door creaking] I thought you were dead, jerk-off. I fucked up.

We had a deal. Promises were made. We had a fucking deal! A fucking deal! [coughing] [truck doors opening and closing] [Richard barks] [Matt] Come here! [TV playing] Matt! [tires screeching in distance] [TV playing in background] It's Richard. What happened? Matt fucked me over. Richard. Is he dead? No. I'll do it. [whispering] Come on, Richard. You're home now. You can do this. We're gonna save you. We're not gonna let you die. You're doing good, Jul. He's smiling. I'm gonna go, okay? Are you gonna come back? Don't worry. I'm around. [low growl] Stop it! You can see you're hurting him! We have to fix his wounds or he'll die. Julie, please. Stop it! We have to take care of him! You don't take care of anybody. You even said so yourself. I heard you at Aunt Monica's. You don't care about me. [crying] I'm sorry, Julie. I was drunk. But I wasn't the one who gave you the beer, was I? No. You weren't. I love you, Julie Bean. I don't like blood. It's gross. ♪♪ [panting] Thanks for waiting. You're welcome. [sawing] Are you set? You're set too, huh, Shawn? He was drunk, yelling. He finally left when I took the toy. He said she needed it. That this little girl needed a weapon to sleep with. Hmm. Mr. Bennett, do you have something to say about this? Is that your version? Okay. Well, according to this report, there are issues of cleanliness, food hygiene seems to be problematic. Mr. Bennett, you took food from a garbage can to feed your sister? Young man, it's time for you to speak up. Now please tell this court why I should award you guardianship of your little sister. Those papers don't say everything. That's precisely why I'd like you to tell me what's not in these papers. Is there any positive element that would help your case? There's no positive element. All I am is the only adult in the house who hasn't croaked. Don't give her to me, Judge. I don't want the kid. [Judge] Okay. It seems you're brighter than I thought. You figured out that being a custodial parent was too much for you to handle. Is that correct? Huh? No. She's easy to handle being with. She's magic or whatever. She'll be a woman before I'm a man. She'll be more beautiful than my mother, and she was a fox. I don't wanna fuck you up. I mean, I didn't do too good with Richard, did I? They didn't want to run away from us. They just died. That's it. It's not our fault. You know, maybe it's God's fault. I'm not gonna croak. God can't do anything about that. If you need me, I'll be there for you. [Judge] All right. Uh, well, I've reached my decision. This court hereby awards guardianship of Julie Bennett to her maternal aunt, Monica Wabski.
