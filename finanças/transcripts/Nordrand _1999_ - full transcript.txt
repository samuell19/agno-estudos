When I'm grown up I wanna be a trapeze artist. When I'm grown up I wanna have lots of children. Jasmin. When I'm grown up... I wanna be a nurse. Tamara. When I'm grown up I wanna be an astronaut and explore planets. Land of hammers, with a rich future, You are the home of great sons, a nation blessed by its sense of beauty, highly praised Austria. Can you show me how to do Rubik's cube? Please Tamara. NORTHERN SKIRTS It's just the blood pressure... If you really want war, go and have war. She doesn't need her baby now. Are you completely...? You have to think, darling, think. Or we won't get along. And when the doctor comes, have the infusion ready. Do you get me? Or else all hell will break loose on the ward. I'm going home Saturday and you, you can go to war. The withdrawal of Serb troops from Bosnia-Herzegovina... started yesterday under the supervision of UN peace forces IFOR. Only sporadic gunfire was reported from the front lines, where two soldiers of the Muslim - Bosnian army were killed today. Vienna. On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the 2nd Republic... Ren?, where are you, hurry up! Over there, the soldiers are coming soon. Come here. Draken will be here, too. You know, planes, very fast and loud, up there, look, any minute. Our army, we need you! Wolfi! Hi! How's it going? Stop that! So, are you coming? We' re going for a drink. I wanna see the tanks! I must leave you here. You continue, but not together. It's not far. There, that's Austria. Over there. Documents! Where's your visa? Unfortunately it expired two days ago. Shit. Any luck? - Oh, hello! What's the time? Another five hours. I can't make it! My head is killing me. You don't look so good. Thanks a lot! Hold on tight. You' re careful, right? Yeah, sure. Not bad. But watch this. Exactly right - two times, 32 seconds, great. How are you? Good, thank you dear. I brought you cigarettes. Do you want something to eat? Take something from the blue bowl. You have to heat it up. I wanna drive too. - OK, come here. Don't, stop it. Ren?, stop it, hear me? No, leave me alone, I don't want any more. What's it? I like you. See? Where have you been? Where have you been all night? None of your fucking business. Don't talk to me like that! Don't talk to me like that! What you look like! Look at you! Where have you been? Give it to me! Look at me! Why is your backpack so dirty? Your new backpack? Where did you put it? - Will you shut up! I'd like to sleep in just once. Where have you been? It won't happen again. But I was... - Shut up! Jasmin, Nicole won't leave me alone. She keeps taking my school bag. Leave Thomas alone. - None of your fucking business! Asshole! How's business, ladies? Everything's fine. New haircut? Like it, ladies? Any special plans for tonight? Well, have a nice day, ladies! Mom, it's me, Tamara. Alexander, come here. How are you? How's Alexander? Hey sis, how are you? Did you get my parcel? No, but don't worry. And you're alright? Everything's fine. How's Alexander? It's cold here. Soon there will be snow. Dad recovered from the flu. Branko has finally returned. Hey, how are you? Is Mom still there? I need to talk to you. I've had a test done today... Shit. Stop! - What's wrong? Can I have one? I'm pregnant. It's for sure. Shit. Can't you take the pill like everyone else? Is that all you can say? - Like what? Shit. Don't! I don't have any clean ones left. Just for now. Come on. I'm on night duty. Why didn't you call that you couldn't come? What are you talking about? - Last weekend. I waited for you. I didn't go out. I can't always arrange my time around you. Now I don't have time. What do you mean: you didn't go out? Are you seeing Marina and the others again? So what? Why not? Have fun then. Come here. You come if you want something. Do you know what it's like out there and what I feel like? You never ask. You don't give a damn. Fucking shit! Anything wrong? You don't give a shit. I could be lying dead on the ground, and you wouldn't care. Can't wait to see you all week and then this. Do you think this is easy for me? I'm off. You know, I just can't imagine this now. I don't have my diploma yet. And maybe I won't have a job. You don't have any money either... and anyway. I didn't want this to happen. I love you. You' re so beautiful. I can't stand it. Hey, you? We' ll stick together, right? It's a wedding gown! Can someone get some milk? Not me. Jasmin? No. Go and ask Ren?. We should ride back. They will be worried in the castle. Look! Look! That's her! Let's go! Hey, don't eat so much. Nobody will look at you any more. More than at you. You just wait... until one of your great guys gets you pregnant. You' ll look different then. What made you say that? I want the best for you. You think I'd let them get me pregnant? I'm not like you. Sure? Are you sure? We only did it once. Don't get me wrong, but... Are you sure it's mine? Yes. It can't be. You even said that there's no need to be cautious, that nothing could happen. But it has happened. How much do you need? 5.900,- We should go out for dinner, and talk it all out. So, maybe tonight. We could meet... There? You know what? I' ll just bring the money tomorrow. Dad is going crazy again. You know, I thought... I could stay with you for a while. You know, G.R. really likes you. Come on! Seriously, he's hot for you. Hi. What about me staying here? I'd like to discuss this with you now. There's plenty of time to talk later. It's much nicer at your place, high up. Not like at home on the ground floor. I'd love to live in a tower. And you? You can't stay here. How often have I told you? But it's big enough. I'd do the shopping. Listen, you can't stay here. I don't want you to. Don't you get that? You walk in and want to move in. What are you thinking? I thought you liked me. Yeah, so what? Please, I have to get out of there. Stop it, will you? - Please. No! You think I need you? Screw you! Screw yourself! I've thought about keeping it. What? Dream on. You can't be serious. Why? Andrea from No 7, she was only seventeen or sixteen. Yeah, and? Look what became of her. It'd be different with me. Come on, be realistic for once. It won't work. You and a kid? Imagine! That's real responsibility. Not just for eight months. Nine months. Whatever - but for 18 years. Do you know what that means? Have you ever thought of that? At some point I' ll want one anyway, so why not now? Yeah, but without me. I don't need you anyway. Many women raise their kids alone. Then you' ll come bawling to me, wanting to move in. Don't shit your pants - it's not yours anyway. What? You've got a lot of nerve! I never want to see you again! Got that? Don't need your bullshit. I'm not your old man. Bye. You must decide fast. I won't be here much longer. I'm off to America. You? America? Will you send me a postcard? Alright. I' ll take the tires. I also need something for my daughter. A doll or something. - Hang on. Maybe I have something for her. Beautiful. Sonja? Are there any sweets left? No. Maybe in the fridge. Pudding or something. Never mind. So? Feeling anything yet? - Stop it. Don't be so hysterical. I' ll be back in a week, to take care of the three of us. I don't want it. What? What do you mean? I've thought about it. Great. You ever think about me? You can't do that. Don't be like that. This isn't funny. You'd have it if it was Milan's, right? What does that mean? We've been through this. Yeah, but now it's happened. Once it's here, things will be different. I don't understand. I thought what we have is special. Not like with Milan. Or maybe it's not mine? Are you nuts? What do you think of me? I don't know. Honestly, I don't know. Do you have to do that? I think I' ll go now. Please, feel free. Bye. Where have you been? I've missed you. You' re looking good. - You too. It's Mario. He was the DJ here last week. Hip-Hop and stuff. What's new at the hospital? Nothing. Is the crazy little... Gitti... - Yeah, her. She's still there. Is Milan here? Haven't seen him. He's with Dragana now. Let's dance. Great song. A little later. This place free? Jasmin, right? I'm Tamara. - I know. Want some coffee? - No, thanks. You should drink something to pick you up. OK. So what do you do now? I work in a hospital. I'm a nurse. Really? Must be interesting. But difficult, no? Old and sick people. Must be tough. At times. Good bye. What about you? I work at a pastry place, out where we live. You should drop in some time for a coffee? Strange, doesn't hurt at all. It will - later. Or not at all. Anyone picking you up? You? I don't know. Wanna come along? No. ...the Bosnian Serbs kept shouting on their way to Grbavica, the Serb center of the hotly contested city. The demonstrations as a sign of rejection... of the Dayton peace plans... - Damn Serbs. I'm a Serb. You still live in that house in the Grenzweg? With your parents? No. I live on my own. Not bad. You don't mind if I smoke, do you? I need it after all that. I' ll open the window. I will come and visit you, often! I am thinking of you! ...even after NATO bombings and despite... current peace talks in Dayton, fighting continues... The Serb population in Sarajevo is not ready to give up... the district of Grbavica. Mines shall prevent the return of thousands of Muslims. Valentin, that you? I can't hear you. Have you heard anything? How long will the visa take? It takes time. I'm hoping to go by Christmas. I do what I can. - When? When, Rocco, when? Calm down. By Christmas, you're gone. Dear Jola, it's very nice here. People are nice too! And I found work already. When are you coming? Love Marta. You know where that is? America? Australia. That's where I'm going. You? Much better jobs there than in Austria. A friend of mine is a model there. America is better. Give me the key! Give it to me. It's not funny any more. Come and get it. Stop it, I wanna watch TV. Go and fight somewhere else! Thomas, make it louder. How did you know I had the key? You lie to me. You go through my things. Who do you think you are? We have to lock you out! I' ll show you! You won't lock yourself up! I can lock you up! But not you yourself! No, don't, Jasmin! Piss off. Stop bawling. She' ll be back. It's me, Jasmin. Open up! Wolfgang isn't in. Are you alone? Long John is here. You know him. Mind if I wait inside for Wolfi? I don't, but he probably will. Dad kicked me out, the asshole. And he beat me up. Here, see? And here too. Can I have a smoke? I don't think Wolfi will come today. Whatever. I'm in no hurry for him anyway. And we' re here. Get lost. What's it, no demand? Haven't you heard I've got a big one? Wanna taste it? Aren't you hot for it? I'm not into babies. What's up? Scared? Certainly not. For all the others you spread your legs. Everyone knows it. After Andi had her, the lift smelled for 3 days. I need some air. Hey, you can't just let me go on my own. Who is this Dragana anyway? Just a silly, stupid... Forget her! Roman, what are you doing here? - And you? I need to talk to you. - What do you want? Come on! - Marina is waiting. Who's more important? Me or Marina? Why do you still come to this dump? I looked for you everywhere. It wasn't easy to get time off. But you seem to have fun without me anyway. You said you wouldn't come here anymore. So what? - What do you mean? Remember what you said about Milan? How down you were? You came here for him, didn't you? Shut up down there, this isn't Yugoslavia. I thought you'd be in bed. - I'm not sick. It didn't hurt? - No. People tell such horror stories, but it's no big deal. It might hurt later. - You'd like that, huh? Was Milan there? - None of your business. We almost had a baby together. What's that supposed to mean? Give me a break. You wanted it too, didn't you? - No. I couldn't care less. It's over. Got it? You think you can stalk me, just because I was pregnant from you once? It's me, Michi! - Long John is here too! Now we' re going to sandwich you! Come on, Jasmin, have another swig. We' re going back to the flat. ...back to the flat... Doesn't matter how we do it: Oral, rectal, vaginal! What's wrong? Not me, OK? You smell nice. Come off it, will you? Just one kiss. - What for? Are you coming with me to America? - Me? Why not? I'm going to Australia. You and your modeling - won't work anyway. I' ll send you a postcard, OK? Raid! What did the cops ask? Did you tell them who was with you? No. You were lucky they didn't have to amputate. The doctor said it was very close. Does it hurt? Please scratch me there. Tell me more before the others get back. What did they say at home? Nothing. Mom's worried. Thomas and Nicole don't know yet. Ren?, stop it. And Dad? I don't want to go back. What do you mean? Do you have to touch everything? Look what you've done. Hey, Ren?! That's enough! What was his name? Zagler. Everyone had a crush on him. You too? For all four years. Remember how we used to jump over the fence during the breaks? And stealing things at the Co-op? They had this cinnamon chewing gum. I was so jealous of you. You were so pretty. Everyone followed you and did what you said. You always said I had lice, but I never really had any. I did. Really? In second and fourth grade. From Daddy. What? To Jasmin. Stay with us. You won't find anywhere better. We need you. Especially the children. Think about it again. You'll see how difficult it is alone. Your father. Where are you? There, in the back. Hidden away. Poor you. Look at Christian. Hey, is this you? My mother. Looks exactly like you. Come on, not at all. Is this the father of your... Wolfi? No. He's just a friend. I mean, I don't think so. And yours? Well, Roman. Look. This is what he looked like when I met him. He was in hospital with pneumonia. He was cute then too. At least he shaved off his beard. Hang on, I' ll show you a pic of my brother. You've got a brother? Yes, Alexander. Sarajevo is a divided city... At the front line in Grbavica, shots were fired today. This was the first incident in 10 days, and another evidence... that the Muslims were not to be trusted. This is what most Serbs think here. Where is it? I can't find it! Sorry. I have found. Hey, where? This can't be. Even the money is still there. But where? In Danube. Thank you. I thought I'd never see it again. Can I buy you a coffee or some pastry? Some cake? A cream puff? Hey, my friend, too. Well, from Yugoslavia - she was. Damn bus. What? Hi, Dad! How are you? Since when can you make phone calls? What. Who? Who? Look what I bought. It was only 65 shillings. It's a bit ugly on one side, but I' ll put it against the wall. Want something to eat? Where were you last night? At a friend's place. Well, he's not a real friend, I couldn't live with him. Understand? No. Please don't kick me out. Why should I tell you who I'm going out with? None of your business, anyway. But if you want, I' ll move out. I' ll find something else. What is it? What's happened? - Leave me alone! What's wrong? Alexander is dead. What? Dad called. Alex is dead. It can't be. I'm sure it's only... a misunderstanding or something. And that in the middle of peace. ...has brought light into my life. The Communist Party... ...the Party, Ceausescu, Romania... What's this? How did you arrange these? That's not what we call order. Move aside. Sweetie, I think we' ll have to do it again. Doesn't look good. What's this? There's one you did right! Unbelievable. Once again, once again, once again. No problem. Just do that shit yourself! This! And that! Bitchy old cow! Want to be on their own at Christmas. Well, if they say so. You know what I would really love to have? A real traditional Gugelhupf. Mother did that all the time. What are you doing here? Just wanted to bring you something. I was going to drop by after work. I'd rather you didn't. But... I don't want to see you fight again. You fight anyway. Even without me. I'd like to see Ren? and Nicole... and Sonja. She could come by, too. Haven't seen her myself for a while. Jasmin, a customer is waiting! You've got to go. At home I'd have had presents. Merry Christmas. But me, I'll stay army-free. What's the salute of the forces? - Hi there, gorgeous! Millions of recruits waiting to take off their boots. One or two will stay until they're blue, but me, I'll stay army-free. You can speak Serbo-Croatian to one another. Or Bosnian. Or not at all. Don't you have any banana liquor and orange juice. Let's have a drink! What's wrong? Come on, do it for me. I've wanted this Christmas Eve party so much. Let's sing a Christmas song. I don't know any. Whatever: 'Oh come little children'. Not very fitting. Where's Jolanta? She's not here today. Rocco, the fucking asshole, damn it! What's up old man? - What? Shut the hell up. D'you have a problem, brother? - What's it? Are you mad? Stop it right now! Why? Why does this always happen to me? What have I done? Where should I go now? Granny? Oh my God, what happened? What happened? What happened to you? Nothing. My grandmother fell. She's in one of those rooms. And you, what... I mean... Night shift. Will you smoke one with me? I'm on duty. A fast one? Well, your fault. OK, OK, but that's no reason to torture me like this. What's your name? When does your shift end? Do you want to go for a drink? Maybe on New Year's Eve. It's very easy. One, two, three... Where are the others? I don't know. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! Are you coming to Sarajevo with me? No. OK. I'm going. In spring. Guess who's here? Damn! Should have thought about that earlier. Where is he? - In your bed. Did he sleep here? - Yes. Where have you been? You don't know him. Don't you think that you're quite an asshole? I'm sorry. No need to apologize to me. You jump into bed with anybody. Just as long as he's hot for you. Every guy knows he can dip his thing into you if he wants to. Sorry. You don't understand. Wait. Here's the test. Thanks. Running into you here today! You know, I'm leaving tomorrow. - What? Where to? America. Wow, really? All the best then! To you, too. I'd love to stay like this forever. Will you forget me? I don't think so. Will you? No, I won't either. Why didn't we do this before? It's actually not bad. Do you believe in telepathy? I don't know. But we can try. Do you mind? But I just had to come. Is it Senad's? Are you sure? - Stop it! Sorry. I've always thought I'd be a good mother. You might be. You think so? - Sure. Why not? Don't know. I've always wanted five children. Just like in my family. Will you come with me? I can't go on my own. You went on your own last time. Exactly. Maybe, the way you talk about kids, maybe I could help you. You think so? Why not? Don't know. You are a true friend. Honestly. And you are no asshole. Neither are you.
