I've come to tell you... ...today I have been sworn in as a lawyer. I'm sure you regret this, but I've succeeded... ...and this is my very last visit to you. Farewell for ever. You no longer exist for me. Congratulations. You congratulate me? I cannot take the hand... ...of someone who's worked against me my entire life. Or worked for you... ...worked FOR you. CHARACTER The victim congratulates you... He says "congratulations", offers his hand... ...you take it and then leave. Must have been a warm handshake! - On the way down... ...you stumbled on the stairs. Ever seen this before? Don't recognise it? It's a lovely knife. But not as lovely as this one... Pick it up... Go on! Pick it up. Remember the feeling? Do you? Call a doctor. You'd like something to drink? To eat perhaps? For me too, please. Mr Jacob Willem Katadreuffe... Do I pronounce that right? You are suspected of murder or manslaughter... ...of court bailiff Arend Barend Dreverhaven. That name sounds like imminent thunder, right? You admit you visited him this afternoon... ...but deny anything unusual happened. Perhaps you could first describe your relationship to him. Mr Kznadreufie'? Dreverhaven... The name was a legend long before I first heard it. It won't be long, sir, maybe tonight... God bless you, sir, you're a good... Bastard! Dirty bastard! Dreverhaven, court bailiff... The law without compassion... ...the curse of the poor. I'm well aware of his reputation... ...but what exactly was your relationship to him? You did business with him? You worked for him? He worked for you? When did you first meet him? At home... At home he had a housekeeper. Jacoba, Joba for short. A surly woman who hardly ever spoke, but he didn't mind. He never said much either. She'd been in his service for a year, when one evening... ...it was a once-only affair. Nothing changed between them... ...but six weeks later she broke the silence. I'm expecting. Well? I'm leaving. The father must support the child. You'll make him pay, won't you? - No. Have you written to him? - No. But you will write?! No! No! Dreverhaven is your father. I'm named after my mother. You mean... He wouldn't take his responsibility? No... It wasn't that. We moved to the other side of town, to be far away from him. She's moved to East. She's rented a room at 142 Zeilstraat... ...for 7 guilders a week. She keeps house for three families... ...and a doctor on East Quay. And the child? It has a name? - Jacob. Jacob Willem. Dreverhavews message consisted of four words. WHEN IS OUR WEDDING? The proposal was accompanied by a postal order for a suitable sum. "Return to sender"! Dreverhaven took the money back... ...only to send it again one month later. Whereupon she returned it again. And he just sent it again the next month. "Return to sender"! The duel lasted more than a year. Perhaps you'd like to come in? Now that the money had gone back and forth 13 times... ...she decided to consider his proposal once more... WILL ALWAYS BE REFUSED BASTARD Your mother is a whore! It wasn't the first time my father's "absence" was mentioned. Whenever I asked who or where he was, she always answered:- We need nothing of him. Then she was silent, as always. I live across the street. Am I intruding? My wife's died. She's deceased. So I thought, just seeing you... ...that you may want to know that I'm available. You don't have to decide right now. I shall consider your proposal. My mother was doubtful, but to me it seemed a good idea. Unfortunately we'd soon be forced to leave the neighbourhood. Your mother's a whore. Jacob, Jacob... Go home! Whore! Go away! That same day, mother packed our things... ...and looked for new lodgings. She had said nothing all evening... ...but I knew I had hurt her... ...because I had gone completely mad during the fight. I took a sacred vow, never ever to lose control again. That's a fine intention. But did you stick to it today? Yes. I don't think Dreverhaven benefited much. Those are your words. However, you did meet Dreverhaven this afternoon... I assume not for the first time. We'd come to live closer to him. By the harbour. Mother bought a sewing machine to earn the rent. For me the house contained a secret that was to play a crucial part. The books were in a foreign language. Since the previous tenants had moved abroad, I could keep them. From now on it became easier to endure her silence. For days I studied the magnificent pictures... ...and soon the strange words proved less alien than I thought. Elephant? At first my mothefs eternal silence had made me think... ...she could not bear my company. Only later did I realise that our characters clashed. Our contacts were awkward and would always remain awkward... ...because we were opposites. Jacob! Joba! Come on... Jacob! There's a boy at the door. - He's looking for his father. Name? - Smith... Smith... Smi... Name? - De Beer. Maas... Verkerk... Dreverhaven. Dreverhaven, 11 South Quay. I'm sorry, I've never seen this boy before. We need nothing of him. Wait. From then on I decided to leave Dreverhaven alone. I can understand that. Do you smoke? Thank you. So what did you do next? You're a lawyer. You decided to study law. After school, mother wouldn't let me learn a trade. There was no money. I had to make my own way. I went from job to job. Van Zwavel, Huizing... ...Kerk... ...Katadreuffe! I'm sorry. Try again next month. Off you go. Work was usually temporary... ...with weeks unemployed in between. I filled the time reading my encyclopedia. It only went up to but I didn't care. I used a dictionary to decipher it... ...and absorb the knowledge page by page. Meanwhile we increasingly got on each other's nerves. I wanted to leave and earn my own living. She made it clear she wanted exactly the same. It's small, but dry and warm. My son. He's moving to the back room. How much? - Seven guilders, full board. I'd rather you didn't smoke in the room. I'm Jan Maan. Jan Maan was a Communist. A factory worker... ...who moved in after a fight with his parents... ...about his fiancée. Trudy... I met her in a lunchroom. My mother said: Lunchroom? She lives off tips. Four weeks later the engagement was off. But Jan Maan was here to stay. I looked outside this morning. Summer is late this year, madam. No sign of it yet... No... Could be quite a while... Don't worry about it, she never speaks. Something the matter between you? - She wants me to leave. Look for work. - Be my own man. Climb my way up in society. Society doesn't want you to climb. - And you will change that? The Party is growing steadily. -Thanks to unemployment. By the end of the century everyone will be a Communist. So you still have time to come along with me. Good afternoon, we came about the advert You're selling a store? - You're standing in it, Mr...? Katadreuffe. -I'm Lucas Meijer. And what will it cost, Mr Meijer? Nine hundred. 200 for the stock and 700 for the goodwill. I don't know... 700 for the goodwill? I don't think he has any customers. I can see a future here. - You see any customers? It's still early and about to rain. And who's going to pay the money? How much? - Nine hundred. I assume you have sufficient collateral. You have collateral? You have no collateral. I don't think we can do business. We're very sorry. MONEY FAST PEOPLE'S CREDIT SOCIETY Good afternoon. I wondered if I could... - Yes. How much? I borrowed 900 from the People's Credit Society... ...to take over a cigar shop. I'm moving out. You could say something. Do as you please. Do as you please! Boy, she's in for a surprise. Again it's very quiet here. -It's still early. And it's about to rain? - You could be right there. Look, if you need me, you can always find me. All the best and thank you. Well... The best of luck. Tell mother not to worry. I've come for Mr Meijer, it's urgent! Mr Lucas Meijer? - Yes, what do you want? Back with mother I realised I'd never wanted my own business. Certainly not a cigar shop. I was only trying to escape from her... ...but there would be serious consequences. Dear Sir, hereby we inform you... ...that your bankruptcy has been requested... ...requested by the People's Credit Society. That bank? All your possessions have been inventoried today. My books! Please report to my office tomorrow... ...with a summary of the bookkeeping, bank debts and rent arrears... ...plus a list of other creditors. Sincerely, Dr De Gankelaar, receiver. Good afternoon, you have an appointment? Yes, I came to see Dr De Gankelaar. Mr Katadreuffe for Dr De Gankelaar? Sir, come this way. Jacob? Well? "Come back tomorrow." I explained everything, and have to come back tomorrow. You'll be all right. Listen, those two run the warehouse. I said you had experience. Don't worry, you just have look smart Yes, but listen... I already have a job... I will have a job... at that office. - What office? That law firm. - You asked for work there? I'm going to ask, tomorrow. - At a law firm? But lawyers work there... I'm going home, I need to think. Your possessions are worth 15 guilders. That is the value of your books and that's all you have? Fifteen guilders is not enough for a bankruptcy. It wouldn't cover the costs, so... I shall advise the court to suspend your bankruptcy for lack of funds. I assume you don't object? You mean...? I mean I shall ask the court to suspend your bankruptcy, agreed? Good. Sir, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to ask you... So what will you do next? Any plans for the future? I'm looking for work. - Work, horrifying. Office work. - Even worse, wouldn't recommend it. I thought of an office like this. Don't. It's boring. I myself could use an assistant, but... You mean that? It's been nice meeting you. Don't let me keep you. You wish to know my qualifications. - Excuse me? I don't want to sound arrogant, but I know more than you would think. You mean your books? Your encyclopedia? It may be outdated and incomplete... It only goes up to T... - To "T"? That means... ...you can't Type, but can do Bookkeeping and Shorthand. There are things I shall have to learn... You're very eager, but what exactly are your skills? Could you come down? A client of Dr Stroomkoning. Mr F. from E. - I'm coming. You've managed to fascinate me... ...but not to convince me. Please excuse me, you know the way out. There must be an explanation, Miss Sibculo... Yes, Dr De Gankelaar? Dr Stroomkoning mistakenly went to the station an hour late. We're trying to reach him now. Dr Stroomkoning called and he's coming to the office! Young man, who are you and what on earth are you doing here? He is applying to be my personal clerk. Sir? To be honest... ...I think we could use him. That has to be now? Sir, may I be allowed to comment? - I think he will be an asset. Sixty guilders a month and no more. Sir? Sir... Congratulations. My mother said nothing about my leaving. Not a word. Not even "do as you please". You'll come and see us, right? - Or else you know where to find me. I decided to ignore her silence. I had rented a room on the top floor of the office. I was free. We both were free of each other at last. Thank you. - If you need anything, just ask. Jacob Willem, here are two new shirts. Wear them with care. In five days my work was to start. At night I taught myself to type at the office... ...and during the day I practiced shorthand in my room. Mr Katadreuffe: Miss Sibculo, Dr Carlton, Dr Rustenburger... "Miss Van den Born, Dr Sprengers, then the Burgeijks... And of course Mr Rentenstein, meet our new colleague. No introduction necessary. I saw his show last week. I hope we shall be spared more of such performances. ...and invite you to consider a mutually acceptable solution. Yours truly, etcetera... What are you doing? Counting the syllables per minute. It could be a lot faster, yes? I think so, sir. - You think so... But do you realise the consequences? If you work faster, then one day I must work faster too. I don't mean to rush you, sir. Miss Te George, just in time. I can't keep up with my new clerk. Please take over. You have met? Mr Katadreuffe, Miss Te George is Dr Stoomkoning's secretary. Don't worry, she will only take down some French. You don't speak French too, do you? That's a big relief. I suggest you find a machine downstairs... ...to type this morning's dictation. Don't hurry. What a splendid specimen. I knew I had found my destiny. In this place... ...the whole world would open up to me. And no one could stop me. Mr Katadreuffe, that was very mean of Mr Rentenstein. Just don't let it get to you. No one... ...not even Mr Rentenstein. Miss Sibculo... The man who's with Mr Rentenstein, what's he doing here? Bailiff Dreverhaven, you don't know him? Does he work here? - No... ...that bloodhound only comes for Rentenstein... ...or when we need a bailiff. What did you say? - When we need a bailiff. "Bankruptcy J.W. Katadreuffe, books, most in bad condition... A.B. DREVERHAVEN COURT BAILIFF He came to our house. Good afternoon, I'm De Gankelaar, receiver.. I have come for Mr J.W. Katadreuffe. Where is it? He isn't here. I fear the People's Credit Society wants his bankruptcy. He borrowed 900 guilders in April 1923. You know that his cigar shop was not particularly successful. He hasn't paid the rent or the repayments. He has two debts... ...and so Dreverhaven has to value... ...your son's PFOPEITY- Mind if I take a look myself? I see that Mr Dreverhaven is already done... Mr Katadreuffe, come with me. Dear sir, we inform you that the bank has again requested your bankruptcy. Please appear in court next Wednesday. Yours sincerely, Dr Schuwagt. They couldn't get money when you were broke. But now I have an income. They'll take your wages, unless we can make a deal... ...but Dreverhaven will never agree. Why Dreverhaven? You borrowed the money from him, didn't you? Didn't you know it was his bank? My boy, everybody knows that. You're in serious trouble. I'll be right back. It's his bank! It's his bank! I borrowed the money from him! He pronounced me bankrupt! Well? - A debt is a debt. Why didn't you tell me he was here? Why don't you ever say anything? I'm going out. See you later? I'll go with him. Why don't you go and see him. - Go to him? I did once. Not a good idea. So you'll do nothing? - I do: I'll go bankrupt... ...lose my job and get drunk now. This afternoon shots were fired and the situation is escalating... Do we watch helplessly as our comrades are beaten... ...into jail? Or... ...do we march to their help tonight? And show the enemy we're not afraid. Look him straight in the eye... And fight for our cause! Go on, run! Jacob Willem. You came to pay your debt? She sent you? No, not her style. - Why are you doing this? To me, to her. Why? You're not here for business. - No, I came to... I came to say I'm not afraid of you. Fine, then I'll see you tomorrow in court I want to know why you're doing this! All right... ...we'll make a deal. I suggest payment in 36 instalments on the same conditions as the loan. This is a once-only offer. That's not what I want! If you don't like it... I guess not... Take him home, so he can think about my proposal. I need nothing of you. I'd rather go bankrupt! Bailiff Dreverhaven with an eviction order. Bailiff Dreverhaven with an eviction order. Tonight? He's kidding. That's suicide. Come back in a week. Dirty fascists! Fascists! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Dreverhaven chose not to attend my bankruptcy case. His interests were represented by Dr Schuwagt. A mister De Wever was appointed receiver. ...13...14...15 guilders from your wages. Are you sure you can spare it every month? The sooner the debt will be payed off. You have no other possessions? - No. Mr De Wever, could I have a word with you... ...those books. I was hoping... ...we could somehow avoid them being seized. Their value is 15 guilders. What do you suggest? So now the boy is in your debt. Based on my present wages... ...my bankruptcy would last at least 18 months. It was a miserable time. Except for... Good evening. Good evening, miss. You shouldn't work too hard. You don't look that well. It's alright to study, but in moderation. How do you know I'm studying? - We all know. You read books. Yes, I do. But I don't find much time now. - What are you working on? A court paper, and you? I'm translating a contract for Dr Stroomkoning. In French. - Yes. ls your room satisfactory? Yes. I'm quite happy with it. May I see it? Not now. Later, when we've finished. The curtain was already there. Does this open? To be honest... ...I never tried. Your own roof garden. Not bad. And where do you live? At home, with my parents. South side. You know the 'green belt'? I used to live with my mother too. But now I wanted to have my own place. You have any other family? I'm named after my mother. I'm her only child, but... ...she has a lodger now. He's almost like a son to her. He's a Communist. We have heated debates about it. You and him or you and your mother? He and I. My mother never says much. It's nice when people can be quiet together. Aren't you afraid of heights? It's getting late. On 1 February 1924, my debt was paid off. I took mother and Jan Maan out to celebrate. I was free of Dreverhaven... ...but I didn't feel satisfied at all. The whole sum... ...including interest, paid punctually in twelve instalments. Exceptional. Exceptional... I'll drink to that. To you, Jacob Willem. Because you are exceptional. Tomorrow morning... ...at exactly 8 o'clock... ...you will be evicted... ...in the name of the law. You don't have the right! You don't have the right! Filthy bastard! I want another loan from you. I need money. How much? Two thousand guilders. Tomorrow at 9 a.m. at the bank. You wanted another loan? You were free of him at last. Never had to deal with him again. But you went back and started all over. I wanted to challenge him... ...and win. Sir, there's a lawyer for you, and the coroner wants a word. Mr Katadreuffe, you've inherited that fighting spirit from your mother. I remember, she put up quite a struggle at your birth. She suffered strange contractions. As if she wanted to hold you back. You went back to Dreverhaven because you wanted to win. I can understand that, but why... ...did he accept your challenge? Dreverhaven didn't need to. He had already won... mseveral times. So what was in it for Dreverhaven? At first, I thought it was strictly business. The next morning he lent me the entire sum. The interest was only 8 percent. But there was one explicit condition. You realise Mr Dreverhaven can reclaim his loan at any moment? You mean that... That at any moment, we can reclaim the money, whether it suits you or not. Ag reed. - Are you sure? The contract. The signature? Despite Dreverhaven's contract terms, I felt sure of myself. I used his money to dedicate myself to private lessons... ...for two years. It is not truth that counts... Truth doesn't count in law... - Only proof. Only that which can be proven. You'll soon pass your exams, young man. The sooner the better, madame. The sooner THE better. Miss Te George... I see you're leaving, but I wondered... ...if you would show me Dr Stroomkoning's library. Go on in. It's lovely. That's where you work? - You can go in, if you want. My holiday starts tomorrow... ...until the end of July. You must be looking forward. I'm not so sure. The prospect of sitting at home all day... I like working here. I like being here. So do I. You know... I want to tell you something. But I'm not sure I should. You may think I'm silly. But when I first came here... ...and walked up to the office... ...the sun reflected in my eyes... I saw my own name on the front. Between Dr Carlton and Dr Rustenburger. ...Isn't that strange? Miss Te George... still at work? Mr Katadreuffe wanted to see the library. That's excellent of course, but I want to lock up. Don't let us stop you, we've finished. Good evening, Mr Katadreuffe, Mr Rentenstein... Mr Rentenstein... Mr Kznadreufie... You've been with us for some time now. And your ambition has not weakened. I even hear from Dr De Gankelaar... ...that your study is progressing extremely well. Dr De Gankelaar overestimates me. I don't think you can be overestimated. But although this firm offers certain opportunities... ...for people of your class... ...they are not unlimited. Understand? I understand. I'm grateful for your reminder, Mr Rentenstein. My pleasure. I take it you speak from experience? My encounter with Miss Te George... ...her reaction to my vision... ...kept me awake for several nights. And she was still on my mind... ...when Jan Maan introduced his new fiancee three weeks later. Jacob? Tell him to give me a doggie for my birthday. You don't have room at home. - That's not true! You'd forget to feed him. She forgets everything. Listen to him! Scoundrel! What a temperament. Coby. Works in a department store. My parents don't approve. "All sons pass by there. She can't be any good," mother said. Coby. Two weeks later she'd run off with another. Mr Kznadreufie'.! I know what you're thinking. This is an incredible coincidence, but there's no such thing. Who says there's no such thing? I do. But I'm sure there are learned theories. I'm over there. Have you swum yet? I only just arrived. And you? - This morning, briefly. If you like, we could swim together. Unless you object. Not at all, it's just... You can swim? - I don't have a costume... ...just books. - You came here to... Just to study, yes. I should have known. But we could go for a walk. - A walk? Can you spare the time? - Yes. Lorna? Hello. - Changed already? Who's this then? He's from the office. - Van Rijn is the name. Right. Cigarette? - No thank you. Lorna? - No thanks. Lovely here, isn't it? Lorna. I'd never heard her first name before. This man called her Lorna. Jacob, Jacob! - Friends of yours? We're back, yoohoo. Cheerful lot. - Yes, I'd better see what's up. Nice to meet you, Mr... - Van Rijn. Strange fellow... Who are they? From the office? - I'm going home. But we just got here. - Sorry, I have a splitting headache. Jacob? Van Rijn. She'd never mentioned him before. Never! She was never brought or picked up by a Mr Van Rijn. Mr Kznadreufie'? I'm sorry to bother you, but Dr Stroomkoning... ...wants to see you urgently. He expects you in half an hour. This is an outrage! You haven't seen the last of me. Mr Katadreuffe, you may have heard... ...that we've had some cash deficits recently. As a result I have just fired Mr Rentenstein. I assume you're not sorry. I certainly am not. Sure you don't want to eat? - No thank you. Then I'll get right to business and make you an offer. I was appointed office manager... ...but we'd not seen the last of Rentenstein. Mr Kznadreufie... Congratulations on your well-earned promotion. Secondly... Dreverhaven wants his money back at once. The whole sum within three days. Now?! Just before my exams! He's already applied for your bankruptcy. But that's impossible. Last time I had two debts. To the bank and the landlord. Now I only have one debt. You can't go bankrupt on one debt. Correct, but Dreverhaven knows that too. He's bluffing. I have one debt. To him and no one else. If you go bankrupt, the office can't keep you. You'll lose everything. Dreverhaven doesn't have a case. I'll be your lawyer. - That won't be necessary. The PCS Bank versus J.W. Katadreuffe. I see Dr De Gankelaar represents you? - Yes, your honour. Fine. The case concerns a debt... The case concerns a debt to... ...to the People's Credit Society. Is this debt acknowledged? Yes it is, your honour. Does the petitioned have any other debts? No, your honour, just the one. Sorry, your honour. My client has no other debts. Is that correct, Dr Schuwagt? - That is incorrect. You are misinformed, sir. Your honour, the petitioned has been bankrupt before. That case ended with complete repayment but... ...the petitioned has since incurred new debts. That is not true. Dr De Gankelaar, I shall be forced to remove your client... Not necessary, your honour. I have my information from the best source. The list of your previous bankruptcy includes an entry:- "Private sale of books, fifteen guilders." It appears that Dr De Gankelaar paid the fifteen guilders... ...to prevent seizure of the books. Your honour... But the petitioned still has the books, so that means... Your honour... He's in debt to Dr De Gankelaar for the sum of fifteen guilders. I request a brief adjournment, your honour. I'm sorry. He's right. I bought your books to prevent seizure. But I'll just say the fifteen guilders are a gift. You don't understand. It's a gift and then the case is closed. I can't possibly accept it. - Excuse me? Dreverhaven has won, I should never have taken him on. Are you crazy? I give you the money and it's all over. That's very nice, but I can't accept. A debt is a debt. Who taught you that? Who taught you that senseless self-chastisement? I give you the money and you take it! People who can't accept a gift, have nothing to give themselves. Nothing! And you have so much to give, boy! I won't let them take that away from you. De Gankelaar decided the case in our favour. The court rules the second debt to be irrelevant. Case dismissed. The losing party had two options left:- They can either force the office to deduct from your salary, or appeal. But Dreverhaven didn't do anything. And he never really wanted me bankrupt either. He just wanted to show me who's boss. Three months later I took my exams. When I returned, there was no one to congratulate me. On the way home I thought of visiting the enemy. But I would have nothing to say to him. .. Just as I realised that ' it was too late. Jacob Willem... What do you want? What do you want? I've come to say you couldn't defeat me in court And from now on you'd better leave me alone. Or else? Why don't you do something to me? Do something to me! Do something! DO SOMETHING! Mr Kznadreufie. Could you come in. Miss Te George? Surprisel! What? You didn't fail, did you? Bravo! ! This is the latest edition. And complete, all 24 pads. Knowledge from A to Z. It's Dr Stroomkoning's gift mostly... ...but everyone contributed. It's from all of us. Congratulations! Thank you. I fear I just scared you. You looked very startled. It's a strange evening. - I had my doubts. You mean... About tonight. Whether I should do it. I really appreciate it. That afternoon, by the sea... I think I owe you an explanation. I think you should know... - Please don't... I'm the one who should explain. I didn't know what I really wanted. But tonight I know for sure. Mr Katadreuffe, allow me... Friends... ...first I thank you for a most wonderful evening. But I have something else to say. Some of you may already have suspected, but... In September I intend to enter law school. Everybody has certain talents. Each of us has to discover them... ...and then develop them... ...so as to make progress. And I'm sure each of us will make that progress... ...no matter where he's from. As long as he focuses on one single goal... ...and is willing to sacrifice everything else. He'll overcome all setbacks and resistance. As long as that one goal prevails... ...and he won't be distracted... ...and will put everything else aside. That is my true conviction. I just wanted to say... ...that I hope we'll continue to work together in harmony. I'm afraid it sounded more like a sermon. Thank you. Well spoken, sir. Are you tipsy? Mr Kznadreufie'? And so to bed... Sleep well... I had not seen it coming. I had failed to read the signals. I was so full of myself, of my future... Miss Te George? Miss? "Shouldn't I show you out? Won't you come back in? the party's not over yet. Miss Te George did not return to the office any more. The next day she wrote a letter, offering her resignation... ...and she was never heard from again. Mr Katadreuffe, you are not well. You're extremely nervous and physically exhausted. You have no resistance left. But do you think I... - No. I don't think you can work. You're a mental and physical wreck. That's all? - No, one other thing. Your mother is not well. You know she has weak lungs. It got worse recently. There is no cause for alarm. She could remain stable for years... But I wanted you to know. She never mentions it. One day I may have to leave her... ...but it won't be to get married. I'm not the marrying kind and neither are you, Jacob. A quiet period ensued: the calm before the storm. I was still in debt... ...but for two years I heard nothing from Dreverhaven. I heard his business was ailing. Rumours about drinking and fights... But one thing is certain. One rainy afternoon in March, he took a decision. When is the wedding, Joba? When will we marry, Joba? Why don't you leave our boy in peace? That boy... ...I'll strangle him for nine tenths and the last tenth will make him strong. I shall never marry you. But I can tell you, there has never been another. Maybe I'll strangle him for the last tenth too. Your rent is cancelled. You have three days to move out. Rent is cancelled! You have three days! You have three days to get out! The eviction tomorrow... I'll call the police. Tomorrow at 8 a.m... ...you'll be evicted... ...in the name of the law. Come on. Let's go home. Yes, be sensible folks... ...and go on home now. Be sensible. Dreverhaven had his floors removed for a lift he would never install. He had cooled his anger on his tenants. Not on me. But the longer he left me alone... ...the more he haunted my thoughts. But that first seizure was quite something. The ship had to be chained up that afternoon. So we went looking for a bailiff. When we finally found Dreverhaven, the ship had already sailed. We chased it in a dinghy... ...and saw it heading down the river. It had not picked up much speed... ...so Dreverhaven ordered our dinghy to the bow. Guess what he did? - He jumped. He jumped in the water. Well yes but... How did you know? Oh I must have told the story a hundred times. Indeed, he jumped in... ...and everyone shouted: "man overboard!" We steered our dinghy to the other side of the bow... ...so they were forced to hoist Dreverhaven aboard. When he showed his bailiffs badge... ...it was all over. That man was brave. Dreverhaven? Brave? Or tired of life? Yes, I suppose you could call it that. He was afraid of nothing. A man like that may know no fear, but isn't brave. He's indifferent. And that makes him dangerous. Dangerous? Come, come... If Dreverhaven hadn't stopped that ship, we wouldn't be here. Jacob? I'm leaving the office. I have applied for a position abroad. When? - In four weeks time. I'm about to graduate. You'll be all right. I wish I could come too. No, you still have some unfinished business. Will you take care? A month later, De Gankelaar left for New Guinea. He had been my mentor and I his protégé. I would miss him. Now that he had left the office I decided to celebrate my graduation... ...with mother and Jan Maan. You should thank God for giving you such a good brain. God? Since when is God mentioned here? To the next round. - Jacob? I'd like to go outside. A let's changed here. These trees... weren't here. Planted after the war. Mother? When he first asked you... ...why didn't you marry him? Once you could see East Quay from here. An ugly view. This is much better. Mr Kznadreufie'.! Mrs Van Rijn? Mrs Ten Have. But Miss Te George to you. Do you still live where you...? - No, but not far from here. I persuaded my husband to move here. He's a bookkeeper. But how are you? Fine. I start my doctoral studies tomorrow. And of course you'll pass. You always succeed. And then you'll be a lawyer. To begin with, yes... Being a lawyer is only the start Then I must specialise... Then things really start And then I'm still not there... - You haven't changed. I shall never marry anyone else. I've never forgotten you. You see that woman? That's my mother. She's a special woman. She must be... ...if she's your mother. Will I see you again? By chance... I will wait for that chance. An old acquaintance. She used to be Stroomkoning's secretary. Was she already engaged at the time? - No. Well, Jacob Willem, then you've been a big ass. 18 months later, my mother died in her sleep. I hadn't seen Dreverhaven for six years. All this time, he had left me in peace. I wondered if he had been waiting for this moment. Without her between us, he could strike at any time. But Dreverhaven did nothing. And when I was sworn in as a lawyer four months later... ...I began to understand Why . You sit at the head, Mr Katadreuffe. Yes. If you'll excuse me... - As you wish. Come on, sit down everybody... Now, I had achieved all lever wanted... ...but at the same time I had nothing at all. And Dreverhaven knew this. He had known it all along. Dreverhaven knew I would I'd come to see him today. Mr Katadreuffe, may I congratulate... Today I have been sworn in as lawyer. I'm sure you regret this, but I've succeeded. And this is my last visit to you. Farewell for ever. You no longer exist for me. Congratulations. You congratulate me? I can't take the hand... ...of someone who has always worked against me. Or worked for you... ...or worked FOR you! Help me. Jacob... Dreverhaven begged you to stab him, but you didn't. You walked away. You left Dreverhaven alive. Yes. Rubbish. It's the truth. Follow me. Dreverhaven was found by his lawyer just before midnight. Not in the attic, but on the ground floor... ...with the knife in his stomach and a broken neck... Several witnesses saw Mr Katadreuffe leave at 5 p.m. The report shows that the fatal wounds... ...were not inflicted before 11 p.m. I think he is telling the truth. Mr Kznadreufie'? What do you think happened in the meantime? You think it was an "accident". Jan! Christ, you look awful. I've been sitting here all night. Almost thought you'd done something stupid. Oh, I still have this for you. Delivered for you personally by Dreverhaven's lawyer. To Jacob Willem... It's a list... ...of his houses, the bank... his entire property. That's all. - That's all!? You'll be a damned capitalist! - You expected more? Not from him. - I wish you all the best. Jesus Christ... Estimated total value: 320,000 guilders... Please contact my lawyer at your earliest convenience... Signed A.B. Dreverhaven, bailiff. No. That's not what it says. Please contact my representative, Mr Schuwagt... Yours sincerely...
