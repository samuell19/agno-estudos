Thank goodness I lived to see the day Scarface massacred your family. Who do they think they are? Your ancestors were nobodies. So even after 10 more generations, you will still be a nobody! Scarface! It's all your fault. As long as you continue to kill, all the people around you will die. BAD BLOOD 20 YEARS LATER LABOR CAFE - Hai. - What? - You're so pretty! - Thanks! Have a boyfriend? Leave me alone. Nosy bastard. - Hai. - What? - Are you hiring? - Yup. How about me? Thanks, but I need a man. You're so mean. Bro, what help do you need? Can you fix cars? Of course, I know everything! Huh? What the heck? How can that skinny guy do anything? Why not me? - Wanna know why? - Why? Because you are too handsome! - Really? - Nope. I said today we will need another person to go with us. - If not, we can't do it. - Brother! - How many do you need? - One. - Me ok? - Okay. - Oh, wait. - Yeah? You. Hey, get in our van. Drive. Wearing this must be very hot, huh? Poor thing. Have a grand opening! ORPHAN MOVING SERVICE That is enough. Let's go! Okay. - Floor it! - Okay. There is still stuff inside. Why go now? Wait for me! PROFESSIONAL MOVER Here you are. I forgot. Thank you, brother. If you need something, just come by my shop. You're really crazy. - Hey, who is that? - Who knows? Maybe my grandfather. Haha, that's nonsense! Hi, Lam. Watch out, kids! Hi, Hanh. Aunty Mai. - Did you just get home? - Yeah. - My God. - Hi, Aunty. Lam, were you cooking again? Yes. - He's punishing me with his food. - My God. Here. I brought some lemongrass chicken. - God, it looks so yummy! - Of course. Aunty, stay and eat with us. No, I have to go home and serve my husband. Haunting them this early? Sitting here like this is called being an honored guest. Peeking into people's houses is what's called haunting. You have such a wicked mouth, woman. - Hey, Lam. - Yes? Are you done cooking for your wife yet? Do you need a bodyguard? I see you're being pushed around. Oh, God. Try making these nonsense jokes to a mean guy, and he will beat the crap out of you. You're lucky Lam is so nice. - What? He's nice? - Yup. No way. He's just being nice for his wife. If a nobody like you tries touching him, you'll see. Hey, Lam. Come over, I need your help. Hanh, let me borrow your husband. My house's door is broken. - Come to my house. - Let me eat first... Fix the door, then go home and eat, okay? Go. Let him go soon, Aunty. Yeah, I know. There are tons of "good" people like him! That's why you can only rely on Lam's help. Can I have some incense? I'll pray to my ancestors to take her away. As soon as possible. - Uncle. - Huh? Come and eat. No, I have to go home, all right? Next time. - Hien! - Yes? Wash your hands and come eat. Then help me do the dishes and laundry. So many chores! I never see you at all. I have an interview this afternoon. Huh? What kind of interview? Why didn't you say anything before? How can I say anything to you? What is that supposed to mean? Isn't that right? You work all day. And overtime. So? But I am home every evening and all weekends. I never heard you say anything. Yes, but when I needed you, you were busy. And I have my own life too. What? How old are you? Earning any money yet? Money for food, school? You still get pocket money from me. And you want to have your own life? Your stepfather wouldn't talk to me like that. Did Aunty Mai pay you? She offered me iced tea. That's not right. - She is always like that. - Tea is fine. See? I'm trying to talk to you. Mom, please respect me. Please focus on our conversation. Okay, tell me then. How did you get the interview? What kind of job? Where is it? Is it a good job? Last weekend I went to a cafe. Then I met a guy. He was nice. He told me about this job which sounded good. He's picking me up for the interview. What's his name? What does he do? Where is his home? His name is Tien. Tien? And his family... Why so many questions? What does it have to do with us? Why not? You just met someone at a cafe and decided to trust them? You and stepfather did the same. But... But you don't even know what they do or where they live. I don't care, and I don't think it matters. Why not? Talk nicely to your stepfather. Don't disrespect him. Wait until you've been through as much as I have. Don't run before you can walk. If you go out, I need to know what you do, who you go with, whether they are good or bad. Just say "Tien" and I let you go? I've had enough. Just don't go at all! The only thing I care about now is getting out of this ghetto! After that you can live with Lam any way you like. I don't care. But, Mom, please think of me. What have I done to make you say I don't think about you? Tell me. Maybe I can take you. I will drop her off and pick her up. Stepfather. Who would hire me if I can't even get there by myself? Why wouldn't they? Is it because they intend to exploit you? Mom. Look at me. I am from a ghetto. Not some hot chick that anyone would want to exploit. We're dirt poor! Hien. What's your problem? You both should be grateful that I'm getting help. Stop trying to make my life end up like yours. You always control me and not let me do anything. That's not love! That's being selfish! How is that selfish? I am worried about your safety. Is it safe here, Mom? Just look around. Out there, the world moves on. And we are stuck here. That is your safety, not mine! Nice speech! You're a big girl now, you can say whatever you want? Say something! You can go. Just call your mom when you get there. Okay? Why don't you just shut up? I don't need it! Some daughter, talking back at me every chance she gets! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to talk like that. It's all right, sweetheart. Are you eating or not? Or shall I dump it all to make you happy? Have you been waiting for long? It's okay. I can wait for you my whole life. Your mother is kind of mean. But your dad seems gentle. He is as soft as a dough ball. I wish he was meaner. Let's go. I'm at the interview place already. But I've been waiting for a while and no one has come to interview me yet. I just wanted to call and let you know that I'm okay, nothing is wrong. He allowed you to go, you should text him! Why are you calling me? You're always on her side. She doesn't listen to me anymore. Why did you still let her go? You want her to be independent, right? I know. But we can't agree with everything she wants. What if she gets spoiled? Don't you know it's dangerous out there? I do know. And you still let her go. She keeps getting her way. - Sh... - What are you shushing for? Am I wrong? But I'm still worried. How come you're home so early today? No one hired you? Or someone stole your job? Tomorrow, I will go with you, to protect you. It's decided. You bad boy! I hate you. You're always the same! You were a waiter before? You've danced a lot? Really well, right? Lots of girls fell for you? So... Is that where you got those scars, too? If the neighbors see us like this, they would call us crazy. But we are crazy for real. No we're not! Excuse me. Excuse me, will someone be here soon? Someone will come soon. Just wait here. Is Tien coming? Who? The friend that brought me here. I don't remember him. I'll just leave as you are leaving. Stay here, love. Now, let me take you to the interview place. Mother! Mother, I'm home! Hi, sweetie, daddy's home! Sweetie! Mother... Scar... face. You had a nightmare again? She hasn't come back yet. This girl will not let me sleep! Where could she be at this hour? She didn't even call to let me know. If she's smart, she shouldn't come back. If she does, I'll break her legs! Shall we try to call her friends? I've called them all. If she does not return by tomorrow morning, let's report to the police. Something has happened to her. - I'm afraid she... - Don't worry. I'll write the full report now and file it to my superior. We will keep you updated. When? I want to know when you'll inform us. In most cases, they just disappear for one day and then come back home. There are over 10 million people in this city. She could be anywhere... What do you mean anywhere? What are you talking about? My daughter has never been out all night before. She always calls and asks for permission. She's never disobeyed. - Yes. I get you... - No, you don't. How can you get it? My daughter is missing. What if something happened? Who will save her? All you do is sit here and talk. I need you guys to go and find her for me. She is my life. If something happens to her, I will not be able to live. Save her please. Stubborn child. She wants to make me die of anger. Thank you, ma'am. Black bean popsicle, please. - Here you are. - Yes! - How much? - 2,000 dong. You two are home already? I just made dinner. Come inside and eat. Turn around! Turn around! Open your mouth! Did you ask him to buy a popsicle? And you still allowed her. What about dinner? I've told you guys so many times. My God! I am so tired! I told you not to eat any junk food near meal time. Unbelievable! What about the motorbike? Hi, Lam. Have you found Hien yet? This morning everyone was talking about her. Have you seen Hien? - No. I haven't. - Me neither. - Did Hien... - No idea! Lam! Looking for the young guy who drove Hien away yesterday? There were two twin girls here asking me to fix their pants then. He arrived on his motorbike. He parked right here. We took photos too. But not with that guy. He wasn't their type. The girls were just posing for fun. They begged me to take photos with them. Here. Wow! Dear God, such a handsome chap. He's handsome, right? Way too handsome! Why are you so tense? Is something wrong? Are you looking for him? Calm down. Let me help. Lu. The scoundrel who hired you yesterday? He has a whole crew to solve all troubles around here. Even when they don't ask him to. The thing is, he knows all the thugs in town. Go see him. He can help you. Thanks. And tell him to pay what he owes me. He always tries to get away with it! ORPHAN FURNITURE Are you lost, old man? All your men are orphans? No! You might be wondering why the store's name is "Orphan Furniture"? So the customers don't bargain. ORPHAN DELIVERY - Is there a problem? - A guy named Tien took my daughter to a job interview. She hasn't returned. - I want to find him. - I see. So today you've come here for my help? Yes, it's true you helped me steal those goods. But I think you won't go and tell the police. Are you sure? If you find him, what will you do? I'm just going to have a talk. Damn. You're gonna mess him up. What did you say? No. I didn't say anything. - Lai. - Yes. Get the boys to find the guy in this photo. Bring your tools to fix him. Yes! Don't fix him. Just find him. Put your tools back. Are you okay? Thanks. Brothers! Spread out and find this guy. A little bit strong, right? It's civet-poop coffee. Next time I'll let you try the charred roast, constipated civet-poop coffee. When they are constipated, the beans stay in there longer and develop more flavors. They're so hard to collect though, hence very expensive. The flavors and strength of that thing are just phenomenal. Okay. As long as the beans were washed. Maybe, maybe not. The guy you need to find is here. - Do you need my boys to come? - No. I'm just going to have a talk. Why did you help him? He's my grandfather. I have to help. Your parking ticket. Thanks. Can I help you? We don't serve local clients. I'm not local. Please, no fighting. I'm just going to have a talk. Hey. That room is private. No entry! Your deaf? Where did you take Hien yesterday? Who's Hien? Old man, you are crazy! I took her to a cafe. I don't know where she went after that. I swear. I swear I don't know. I swear. I only met her. I took her to see an art appraiser. I don't know what happened later. Who? Thanh "Fawn Eyes" at the Banyan Market. Thanh "Fawn Eyes"? He's... cross-eyed. Only sometimes. Go to Banyan Market, they all know him. I'm telling the truth. I swear. Was there a fight? I heard screams. They were not used to a hot stone massage. Ride safely, bro. Thanh "Fawn Eyes". I heard everyone knows him. Hey! Aunty, uncle, please move! Out of the way! Eat vegetables now! This is for you! Here's sautéed spinach! Here's dragon fruit! Eat them all! Robbery! Help! Robbery! Bastard! Are you crazy? Hey. Why did you take my charcoal? Get out of the way! Forget him. Follow me. My rule is... when I drink, I drink. Same as arresting someone. I didn't bring you here to have a drink or to be arrested. Thank you. So why did you want to see me? Are you a dangerous person? I'm just a regular laborer. I know who you are. You're quite smart to lay low like that. Tall grass gets cut first. Why were you chasing Thanh? My daughter was taken. It was Thanh who took her. He pointed me to Thanh. I just want to find my daughter. Do you have any proof that Thanh had something to do with it? No. Not yet. Yet you're still chasing it yourself. I advise you to stop. Thanh is very important to our investigation. We won't let you or anyone else jeopardize it. But I must find my daughter. However, if you interfere with our investigation in any way, you will face severe punishment. What is it? What? Hey! Who are you? Hey! You... you guys. Who are you? Where is the old geezer, Lam? Where is Lam? Tell me! If I scream, the police will come and arrest all of you! Someone help me! Police? He is not here. Brother Tien. Listen to me. You can be uneducated but don't be evil. That is spirituality. Oh, my God! Asshole! How dare you? Brother Tien! What if she can't take it and she dies? Calm down. Get motherfucking lost! You... He calls you Tien... You are the one that took Hien away. Where is my daughter? Where is my daughter? If anything happens to her, I will kill you. Call the police to take all those thugs away. - Mai. - What? Call the police. You go and do it yourself. Smartass. Let's go inside. They're terrifying. Listen, you old people! Today I came to teach Lam's family a lesson. Anyone trying to object or call the police will be dealt with. Hanh! Go! Go to hell. Beat that fucking bastard to death! Police! Police are coming! Police are coming! Police! Police! Find her. Don't leave her... Don't... Are you missing your child, sir? Do I look like your child? Why don't you go home to see your daughter? Why do you laugh while crying? Time will heal. Mom always tells me that. All things come to pass. Hien. Let's go home. Goodbye, sir. They are coming. Do you know where they are taking us? I have no idea. I heard them mumbling about something called "Thien An". Sister. Please help me escape from this place. I will go and get some help. Get out! Get in the van! Hello, Grandma. Hello, kids! What are you eating? Pho with beef balls. Yummy. Want some? Let me order. Grandma, make me a bowl of Special Pho. Full toppings! I thought Grandma was deaf. No idea. But don't worry. She always brings the same thing. So why bother ordering? If you don't order, she won't bring you any. What gift do you have for me? This guy. He was fighting then ran into grandma's. Such bad luck. You covered my mouth and nose? How can I breathe? Answer! Answer me! Please, sir, let me go. This guy, he is not normal. He stuck something up my butt. When did you learn how to torture? When your old man was constipated? Take it out now, or it's going to be digested. This son of a bitch! My son. We don't curse here. Who is your son? Oh, God, really. You're crazier than this son of a bitch! Now talk to daddy. Why did you and your friends make a mess at old Lam's house? You caught me before I could do it. Go and ask him. Why did he have to go around talking trash? Messed up our operation. What a stupid question! My son. Trust me. That drama king, he is a wolf. Not a sheep. Now be wise and answer your daddy. Or after daddy finishes this bowl of Pho, I'll let you stay here with Grandma, and my little brother will look after you. What do you say? I want to meet Mr. Linh. Working hours are over. Do you have an appointment with the Inspector General? No. FINE ART APPRAISERS ASSOCIATION Yes. Thank you, sir. It looks so artistic. If you want to learn more, then come here. I will share with you all my experience. Long time no see. Working in this field, you would know everyone. I'm looking for... an art appraiser named Thanh. When chasing ghosts, watch out for devils. Are you here to kill me? No. I came to give you a present. A painting from Indochina. An heirloom. I can't take it. Art is only valuable to others. But not to me. Thanh was kicked out of my association last year. Now he's joined Tung's side. Tung is a wealthy emerging businessman. Little is known about him. But according to my sources, he has been seducing young girls from poor families who want easy, high-paying jobs abroad. I gave you a chance to make money. To feed your family back home. And yet you failed. Let me ask you. Should I forgive you? This business made Tung rich. So he built the trendy The Factory recently. For displaying contemporary art works. Also for meeting the elite and money laundering. Most importantly, for him to lure and kidnap young girls. If I don't return in an hour, please call my friend for me. But I want to warn you, people like you won't be welcomed. It's easy to get in. But there is no way out. What about the old guy? He will come here, sooner or later. I've already prepared a party for him. Sir, where are you going? Sir! What you're looking for is not here. You're a nobody. You shouldn't be here. Where is my daughter? Where is my daughter? Trust me, old man. Forget about her. Be careful, he might have spoken to the police. Something's wrong. Let's go. - Motherfucker! - Are you crazy? People have seen him come in. You want to fix him, go somewhere else. You're cross-eyed, don't be stupid for me. Do you understand, little brother? - Good. - Yes, sir. Do it. I'm sorry, Big Brother. I'm sorry, Big Brother. Wait. Before coming here, I visited your wife at the hospital. Lam. You don't dare. I don't dare? Don't dare to take this? Go. Lam. Lam. Lam. Lam. It's me, Lu. Get up, brother. You are always like this. Said you just went there to talk and made a huge mess. What are you doing? As long as you continue to kill, everyone around you will die. Brother Lam! Brother! Wake up! You remember me now? You used to be a lot chubbier before. I'd sinned so much in the past. So I became a monk for a while. Eating just vegetables and fruits. Lost more than 20 pounds. At that time, I prayed everyday. If I could get away, I'll find a temple and become vegetarian. - So since then... - No. I'm still the same. Lu. Where do I go to find Hien now? Sorry, boss. I forgot to count them. It's okay, brother. That's normal. Sir! Please wake up and help me. - Sir! - Shut up... Mom, please pick up. This number is unavailable. Help me, stepfather. The number you have called is not in service. Thien An, help. Send Message To Number I'm sorry, Mom. The girls are now staying in safe houses in the Mekong area. Thanks to you, Tung now thinks his business is exposed. I think he'll move the girls soon. They will go on a ship called Destiny. It's a private ship, so it can dock anywhere. It's hard to find. We don't have enough time to find out. Thien An? Thien An port. Hey. I don't think you should go. Lu, they killed my wife. Kidnapped my daughter. I'm tired of being treated like a nobody! Because you're acting like a nobody! Listen to me. It is time for closure. - Let me come with you. - No, Lu. This is not your fight. You have done so much for me. No need to be involved further. Hanh died because of me. I don't want you to be involved. THIEN AN PORT DESTINY I'm done. Where do you keep the girls? Crazy bastard! You won't be able to escape! Hien! Hien! Hien! Hien! Hien! Are you here? Hien. You are surrounded. Surrender now! I repeat, put down your weapons! Stepfather! Stepfather! Stepfather! Hang on. Don't die. Hang on, Dad! I will listen to you from now on. Dad. Why are you laughing while crying? I'm sorry, Dad. All suspects were apprehended on this ship. They will face judgement in court. Thanks to you, we were able to catch Tung before he could escape. But don't forget, you still owe us one appointment after you recover. Your mom always said you were her tough daughter. No matter what happens. I will find a way to survive. I have to go. She will always be with you. Dad. Come back soon, Dad. We all have to pay for our sins. In this life or the next. I have to face my past. Babe! Babe! Babe! Babe! Did you get tired and fall asleep? Why are you here? Everything is done. Go home!
