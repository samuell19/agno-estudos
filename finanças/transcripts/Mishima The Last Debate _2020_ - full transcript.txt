This documentary is based on archival footage from 1969. Opinions expressed have not been altered in any way. A time of activism Radical student movement The World Revolution Confrontation at Yasuda Auditorium, the University of Tokyo May 13, 1969 At the University of Tokyo in Komaba over 1,000 students waited in Lecture Hall 900 for a man. They belonged to a radical leftist league called Zenkyoto. Here to face his archenemies was Yukio Mishima. The iconic right-wing novelist idolized the Emperor. I saw resolve in his eyes. He wanted to persuade those 1,000 students. He was a genius. Very sharp. A superstar. He was at his most brilliant. Communism is my enemy. For Mishima, the Emperor is... We struggle with the same difficulty. You can't transcend being Japanese. That's OK. It was a debate of polar opposite political ideologies. This is where the legendary debate between intellectuals begins. This 50-year-old footage is in TBS Television archives. With accounts from 13 witnesses and experts we attempt to reconstruct the legend. Mishima: The Last Debate In the 1960s, war was an imminent threat to the Japanese. As the Vietnam War raged on students protested against it and university bureaucracy. Activism spread rapidly. Students who rejected the existing New Left groups formed Zenkyoto groups at universities, with more autonomy. It became a nationwide political movement. Demanding affordable tuition and autonomy they became radical and confronted the school authorities. The students protested against the war on and off campus. The combatting students and riot police made Tokyo a war zone. January 1968 Protest against the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise October 21, 1968 Riot on Anti-War Day 1968 was dubbed the "Political Season." While some feared a revolution in Japan others wanted one. One man who observed the riots became concerned about society. He was Yukio Mishima, the novelist. Mishima was born in 1925. While at Gakushuin High School the prodigy wrote a novel, The Forest in Full Bloom. He studied law at the University of Tokyo during WWII. He continued to write and survived the devastation of war. When Japan lost the war, the Emperor renounced his divinity. Mishima quit his Finance Ministry job to focus on writing. He explored inner turmoil in Confessions of a Mask and youth in The Temple of the Golden Pavilion among other masterpieces. He wrote prolifically for 25 years. There are 42 volumes in the complete Mishima collection. World-famous, his books were translated into various languages. For the sake of my art. Mishima, the "writer in action" did not only write. He took up bodybuilding to get a body of steel. He was proud of his physique and modeled for magazines. He wrote and directed plays and kabuki. Be more cunning like you have a hidden motive. He starred in a yakuza movie. He did boxing and karate. Also skilled in kendo, he had 4th dan ranking. He wielded both pen and sword. He trained with the Self-Defense Forces and flew in a jet fighter at supersonic speeds. During the 1960s Mishima became openly political. His writings reflected his political beliefs. In October 1968, Mishima founded a private organization named "Tatenokai" or the Shield Society. He recruited students who believed in right-wing nationalism. Whereas the leftist students wanted a communist revolution their motto was "anti-revolution". Mishima and his militia trained with the Self-Defense Forces as they anticipated conflict. We need young men who are trained in firearms for an emergency. He was also writing his magnum opus The Sea of Fertility tetralogy and was up against Kawabata for Japan's first Nobel Prize in Literature. In the spring of 1969, Mishima got a phone call. It was the Zenkyoto branch from the University of Tokyo. The Zenkyoto branch at the University of Tokyo was formed in 1968 to reform the school with activism. On January 18, 1969 riot police dispersed students occupying Yasuda Auditorium. Students fought back with gasoline bombs but were contained by tear gas and water cannons. Zenkyoto was defeated. Zenkyoto embraced violence to fight the Establishment. They invited Mishima, a reactionary, to a debate. Their motives were unclear. Right vs. left. Conservatism vs. Radicalism. A public debate discussing two extreme political views was a dangerous yet thrilling proposition. It was to be held in Lecture Hall 900 in Komaba campus not in Hongo campus where students occupied Yasuda Auditorium. A poster at the door called Mishima an "Anachronistic Gorilla" asking for a 100 yen "to feed the beast". "We'll shut him up with logic and make him" "commit harakiri on stage." That's what students said, apparently. Mishima, the Zenkyoto members and the audience members waited tensely for the debate to start. And it started at 2:05 PM. Chapter 1 Mishima's resolve: Seven enemies Mishima's opening speech went for over 10 minutes. 1,000 hostile students were occupying the hall. His conviction was surprising and provocative. You saw the act of having me on the podium as reactionary... I guess that I am qualified to be here as I am reactionary. As the saying goes, "When a man leaves his house he has 7 enemies." There are more than 7 of you so I needed resolve to come. On the morning of April 28, I met a man who's part of the "establishment." He's brilliant but not a top guy. There was a nationwide anti-war demonstration on April 28, 1969. Activists protested in Tokyo and cities across Japan. As a result, nearly 1,000 students were arrested. The "establishment" guy said that the protesters were deranged and that they were idiotic to protest like that. I'm not saying this to grovel but his remark bothered me. He can send you to a nuthouse if that's what he wants. But it's undignified for a government to panic over a bunch of nuts! I think nutcases should be looked after. Medicate them. Psychiatric medication has improved. Lock them up and look after them. Don't go hurting and killing them. That's inhumane and unacceptable. I don't think any of you are nutcases. I came here with the intention of seeing if words are still an effective method of communication. That's what I came here to verify. Keiichiro Hirano (44) Novelist Mishima said that he wanted to see how effective words could be between people with opposite beliefs. Which was an essential issue for Mishima. The impact of his words was a pressing concern for him. Would they affect reality? Would his words affect people with opposing beliefs? That idea intrigued him. Looking at that man from the establishment on that morning of April 28, I saw no fear in his eyes. Fearful eyes That impressed me. It made me wonder what it's like on your side. If I imagine that, I think of the novel, Therese Desqueyroux. In the novel, Therese attempts to poison her husband. What was her reason? It's not clear. Maybe she didn't love him. Maybe she hated him. It's unclear but she felt compelled to poison him. The author, Francois Mauriac, explores her psyche. In the end Therese says, "I wanted to see fear in his eyes." I guess you want to see fear in the eyes of Japan's establishment. I do too, from a different angle. I don't like assured people. In fact, I don't like this false sense of comfort I have now. I heard that you all chipped in 100 yen or more for this event. I don't like how I'm unwittingly helping your fundraising. It's too political for me. I'd rather take my share for my Shield Society. A Liberal Democratic Party politician asked me the other day to sign a petition against the violence. I've never protested violence so I told him I couldn't comply. Left-wing or right, I'm not against violence. Because of the ironic way violence affects our society nowadays. I think that unconditional denial of violence would only play into the hands of the Communist Party. I don't like that. Observing the LDP and the Communist Party join hands I knew something dreadful was happening. Observing the University of Tokyo student riots I never said that I feared violence or that we should deny it. You won't read that in any of my writings. The worst part for me was that after the assembly at Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium, your university tried to resume entrance exams. On January 10, 1969 Acting Chancellor Ichiro Kato negotiated with communist and non-political students in an effort to stop the students' strikes at the University of Tokyo 7-faculty assembly. The Communist Party and the LDP fell into line. Not every student is combative and politicians saw it as an opportunity to end it. They know that most Japanese don't care about ideology. They value order over logic and integrity. Order is more important and the police maintain it. As long as the police maintain superficial order left and right-wingers can unify. A poster on the door calls me an "Anachronistic Gorilla". I admit I am primitive. The politicians' lack of integrity upsets me. I want the LDP to be reactive and the Communist Party to be violent. But they hesitate. That's what frustrates me the most. I don't know which one of your sects I'll have to fight. I don't know who my enemy is. I write about my ideology everywhere and when the time comes, one must rise. I don't really agree with the concept of lawful killings. Illegal violence I'm not opposed to the death penalty outright but I don't want to be the one who kills lawfully. You see me as part of the establishment but only the Self-Defense Forces can open fire to disperse a riot. I'm not one of them but they've been good to me. I am a civilian. If I were to act, it would have to be illegal as it is for you. If I took someone's life in a duel, it'd be murder. In that case I'd kill myself before I was arrested. But I don't know when that chance will come so I work out in preparation to become the best Anachronistic Gorilla I can be. That's my resolve. Mishima at the time said illegal violence was acceptable. At a debate with Hitotsubashi University students a year earlier he said, "Political assassination is acceptable" "in accordance with duel ethics." This became controversial. Before I came here today one of you said that we had something in common. The Mishima and Zenkyoto connection Let me explain what it is. It's about perceptions of violence. You League members theorize physicality through ideology then find a logical connection with violence. That's what you said and I agree with you. We might be able to have a constructive discussion on that point. That's why I'm here. In terms of political orientation you and I are supposed to be polar opposites. We are but let me tell you this. Japanese intellectuals believe in ideologies. Anti-intellectualism They believe in the superiority of the intellect. I don't like their belief that they're above humanity, like rulers. There are many accomplished professors and I always hated seeing their faces. It might be because I lack intellect and ideology. I could always smell that snobbery all over the University of Tokyo. I don't approve of all of your activism but you undermine those snobs who act intellectually superior. I absolutely recognize that. I'd like to understand what anti-intellectualism means. Are you so intelligent you're against intellect? Are you anti-intellect because you're unintelligent? I don't know which it is. If Professor Masao Maruyama advocated anti-intellectualism everyone would be convinced. But he wouldn't so you guys punched him in the face! Maruyama was a leading political theorist whose views on democracy were influential in the post-war years. The University of Tokyo professor was seen as authoritarian by Zenkyoto. Where in our mind does anti-intellectualism derive? Who is entitled to practice anti-intellectualism? I've always wondered about that. Tatsuru Uchida (68) Professor emeritus at Kobe College joined the University of Tokyo in 1970 Mishima talked about anti-intellectualism which reflects his beliefs. He praises the students for deconstructing early 20th century intellectualism. Then the mic was handed over to a Zenkyoto member. Unfortunately "violence" is not only defined on its primitive and visceral origins. The problem of post-war intellectuals as Mr. Mishima pointed out We're not supposed to be deferential... But hear my excuse. Mr. Mishima deserves our respect more than our professors. I hope you can accept my excuse. I think his critique is spot on. But he hasn't proven yet Osamu Kimura was an organizer and the master of ceremony. He was a 2nd-year student at the University of Tokyo. I couldn't help being deferential. He was so mild-mannered. Osamu Kimura (72) Former Zenkyoto member Mr. Mishima was not at all brash when he talked to us. He was different from how I expected. After the monumental defeat at Yasuda Auditorium Zenkyoto's existence was at stake. Kimura and the organizers were based at Komaba campus. As a part of the "bonfire festival" they planned a public debate. And they chose Mishima as their guest of honor. After the occupation of Yasuda Auditorium Osamu Kimura Zenkyoto was weakening. But we wanted to continue as an organization and we didn't want our activism to be nullified. So we discussed our strategies and came up with the idea of the bonfire festival, which Kosaka named. Shuhei Kosaka A University of Tokyo student Daisaburo Hashizume (70) Sociologist/Former Zenkyoto member It was their attempt to have a cultural win after their political defeat. Our bonfire festival had religious symbolism too. We were in the mood to burn stale intellectualism. Mr. Mishima was invited to join us with that intention. I called at midday but his wife said that he slept during the day. He'd wake up to write at night so I was told to call back in the evening. I called again at around 1 AM... I thought it'd be late enough. And he answered. I read his Culture Defense Theory so I proposed that we had a public discussion about Japan. Culture Defense Theory (1968) Mishima outlines the Emperor's role in restoring Japan's traditions. Initially I'm sure he thought of us as a bunch of hooligans so like he said in his speech he felt like a man who'd accepted a duel. I'd like to know what the Other means to Mishima. He called himself an Anachronistic Gorilla. I think we're all scared of big, hairy gorillas. No offence intended. Violent acts cause anxiety. By merely directing oneself to be violent would it be effective politically and socially? What are "Others" in relation to our effectiveness, Mr. Mishima? On others Killing someone is easy but you may be killed by someone else. If you say your identity is ultimately maintained by violence what are "others" to you? I hate Jean-Paul Sartre but in Being and Nothingness he asked what is obscene? He wrote that a woman tied-up defines obscenity. In Being and Nothingness Sartre analyses the relation between oneself and the Other. We only find eroticism in the Other. And violence is deeply connected to eroticism. Attraction to the Other is core to eroticism but the Other is subjective and has a mind. That gets in the way of eroticism. So, loving a being with a will makes equality between genders contradictory. Because the relationship of achieved love isn't erotic. When one of them is not free to act or think it's the most obscene and erotic situation. I think this is essential to interpersonal relationships. Let's say the Prime Minister was bound up and sitting here. It's not erotic. Former Prime Minister Eisaku Sato In office 1964-1972 But to treat him violently isn't something you'd do willingly. You acknowledge hostility from the Sato administration. You acknowledge that they have their own mind. By acknowledging it, you put yourself in a relationship with others on a nonerotic basis. Which in my opinion is not an essential conflict between the self and others that defines human relationships. Because technically we want others to be like a kind of malleable object. That's how we believe others should be. We all want others to fit in with us. So if others don't the relationship between you and others sours. It's nonerotic. But a nonerotic relationship shouldn't result in violence. It's not violence but the beautiful word you use, "conflict." A confrontation that involves the self and others. It's based on the mentality of a duel. That's why violence committed by students is not really violence. Let's try to imagine how the police view you. As I said if you were a bunch of nuts who have no sense of self the police shouldn't be violent. But they are, because they acknowledge that you're a subject. To create such a situation in which the self and others are forced to relate and form a relationship without objectifying each other. This is the only way for the self and others to enter a relationship. What I mean is that eroticism is not a relationship. What it is, is obscenity or lust as Sartre puts it. You lust for "an object." But when the self and others form a relationship there's inevitably conflict. You asked about my view of the Other. It's something I've come to crave. As a novelist I aspired to relate to the world erotically. I did that with my earlier novels. That's why they're like Kenzaburo Oe's novels. Then I became tired of it so I needed a relationship. A relationship yields conflict so I had to have a hypothetical Other. So I decided that communism is my enemy. And it must remain that way. Communism is my enemy. Communism is my subjective Other. The audience was unaware that the core members of the Shield Society sneaked in the hall to protect him from assault. Akihiro Hara (71) Former Shield Society member He was in the front row. Mr. Mishima would be amongst hostile activists on their turf. We thought that something terrible could happen to him. We thought it'd be extraterritorial in a way. The Shield Society opposed communists and their revolution. They felt hostile towards leftist movements. The communists wanted a communal society... That's what the left-wing activists Yutaka Shinohara (71) Former Shield Society member Waseda University graduate The student leagues wanted to achieve that. So for us they were mortal enemies. The left-wingers had a big presence and there were those who didn't like that. Yukitomo Miyazawa (72) Former Shield Society member Waseda University graduate Like us. Akihiro Hara Former Shield Society member The University of Tokyo campus was barricaded off that day. Tokyo University of Foreign Studies graduate Zenkyoto had a security check at the gate, checking everyone's identification. Once inside it was their turf. Their signs were everywhere. Did a communism revolution seem imminent? Yes. All university students thought it might happen any time. It felt that way when you entered the school gate. There was danger of a civil war. I know it sounds like a joke but there really was. They were called "toy soldiers" but Mishima planned to deploy them when the police failed to contain the New Left radicals. Their Self-Defense Force training was genuine. It was real military training. What we did... We did things that Self-Defense recruits wouldn't do. I'm telling you because enough time has passed. We used live ammunition. I don't think we were allowed to use live ammo. If the left-wing activists came at us with batons we thought we could overcome them with our samurai swords. Zenkyoto also thought that they'd be attacked. Osamu Kimura Former Zenkyoto member We had to be prepared for possible violence so we had around the stage guys we could trust. We were afraid of the communists and the Democratic Youths. It was quite possible that they'd storm in with batons. The Democratic Youth League was organized by the Communist Party. They opposed Zenkyoto in ideology and sided with the university. The Democratic Youth League ran Komaba campus. It was like we were under martial law. But there weren't enough of them to cover the campus so we had a little freedom around Lecture Hall 900. Lecture Hall 900 was miraculously a neutral territory. Chapter 2 A duel One of the Zenkyoto members made a proposition. ...let me present this question. Man's relationship with nature Let's discuss the idea of man vs. nature. Based on what he's said so far, Mr. Mishima's idea of nature is restricted to the human body and the will to put one's body to use. To me, nature isn't tied to humans. It exists before our eyes. Maybe we can't see it in the city but I believe that it's there. The kind of nature that rejects humans. What matters for us is how humans make the most of nature which can't be controlled. Excuse me. In your rhetoric, nature has many definitions. One is nature, found in rural Nagano. Another is found in Tokyo's high-rise buildings. Or do the riot police batons embody nature? Or an environment where production occurs...? So if we are to access production via an object we may also access production through a riot police baton. If the riot police officer beating you is a farmer's son, you might find nature in his spirit through the object he beats you with. Don't understand nature at all. Who doesn't? What do you mean? You dropped the subjective noun. That's correct Japanese, but who do you mean? You don't? - Or me? - I know what you mean but you can't clarify anything with that rhetoric. It's elusive. I see your point. The man on stage with his daughter is Masahiko Akuta, the University of Tokyo-Zenkyoto's best debater. Take this desk for example. An ordinary, dirty desk. It's here at the University of Tokyo to be used in lectures. But it can be repurposed to build a barricade. Which the desk never dreamed it would be. Its new purpose is detached from what it was originally. It has become combative. When an object is detached from the purpose it was produced for you awaken to its true modern meaning. Because you are detached from the chain of production. And that's how you return to nature, the basis of labor and production. Is that the impetus for your violence? Violence... can't be clearly defined unless it's Relationality and objects detached from other meanings. Relationality and objects Sorry? A desk is a desk in the space defined as university so no university, no desk. - An object. - Indeed. In relational theory, an object could be a weapon or what we determine it to be. When relations are inverted it's revolutionary. A space emerges in those relations. When you write about a desk, your words weigh the same as the desk - or it becomes recit or roman. - You're right. recit = story roman = novel That's where you were defeated. Not yet! That's how it seems to me. For Mishima he saw perception as the antithesis of action. He reached adulthood when Japan lost WWII and his impression of the survivors was that they put their perceptions before action. Keiichiro Hirano Novelist He believed that action should come first. He thought that by prioritizing perceptions you'd never touch "actuality." And as a survivor, he compensated for that tendency. So Akuta told him he was defeated. And that highlighted Mishima's dilemma. Akuta told Mishima that his perceptions weren't real to him. He was provoking Mishima. A writer writes. His writings are the objects he produces. That's the reality of a writer. Like you say, it has nothing to do with production. Right. Writing is detached from the act of production, so existentially it doesn't relate to us. Right. You spoke of "space"... It's mere Form. - So I - OK, go on. That's where I think you lost the game. The Form you use to express yourself has as little impact on us as violence. Our action is Form and content at the same time. It's just an expression, not a revolution but history's potential is in the space our action embodied. That's what we do. Anything you say as a writer is embarrassing. You want to turn your game into demagogy. You don't exist without Japan. - That's me. - Yes. But my ancestors can not be found in Japan or anywhere else. Right. But I'm not a "Stranger." Everyone else became "Strangers." Right. So we are ready to advance to the 21st century. Why kill in order to protect culture? Masahiko Akuta (73) Former Zenkyoto member Does the Emperor symbolize culture? Without addressing those questions Mishima is just a demagogue. Akuta led an experimental theater group. He wrote, directed and acted in productions. He co-published Underground Theatre with Shuji Terayama and was a pioneer in experimental theater. I'm an actor. Changing theater means changing what it means to be human. It's also about changing the arts. That's avant-garde. If the arts can't change, nothing can. Revolution is the purest form of poetry. How can you turn the transcendental into a theory? With theater. Osamu Kimura Former Zenkyoto member What Akuta does... How can I put it? He deconstructs all established concepts. He was cutting-edge avant-garde. Daisaburo Hashizume was with Akuta's theater company He was also a talented painter. A true artist. Akuta Hashizume Everyone knew that. Thoughts are a liberated zone. Intellectuals cultivate beautiful liberated zones so we felt a responsibility to cultivate it. We invited Mishima to foster that environment. To make a liberated zone we need both new and old ideas. Let's talk about simpler things. Something easier to grasp, like a "liberated zone." Liberated zones Let's discuss that. In the moment that an object collides with another object does a liberated zone emerge in that space? - Yes. - OK. A "liberated zone" is a place under the revolutionists' control such as the Yasuda Auditorium during the University of Tokyo riots. The space, whether it's created or distorted will temporarily persist There's no time or relation in space. - No relation? - Or distortion. It's the original state. "Returning to nature" as Rousseau put it. Nature. So whether the space persists or not is not important? There's no time so it can't persist. Then whether it lasted for 3 minutes or if it lasted as long as 10 days there is essentially no difference? It's wrong to even compare them. Dimensionally? Is your work comparable to thousands of years of time? I think not. But it's a part of that continuum of time. I intend to express time, if not space. If liberated zones express space I'd like to know how that intersects with time. So in terms of the tactics of revolution it'd be good if the liberated zone lasted a week. So if it lasted for 3 or 4 hours, does that mean it didn't last or didn't it have to? Shouldn't revolution be persistent? I'm not a leader but if I may... Those who created the zone were failed by it. Not by the riot police? No. Did the zone fail because of objects or time? It's the reification of objects and/or space. Don't reified objects or space negate the existing condition? It never fails to negate I disagree because it's relational. Like civilization... History is an existential way for us to deal with reification. - History is persistent. - No It's a space of potential, it's freedom. However when freedom is given we often fail, it's a habit reinforced by civilization. But what we do with barricades is a form of perceiving history. But we don't perceive like a sniper. We do it with a shotgun. That's post-Sartre. So your action is a new perception. And there is no room for persistence in that perception? No intention to make it last? Let's say a cigarette pack is made and if it disappeared the same moment, you couldn't smoke one! Time has passed since it was manufactured and sold to me. Now I can smoke one and pretend to look relaxed. Due to the time passed since production You smoke to force time to persist. I don't have to force it to persist. But it doesn't persist. And you feel lost because you're other-directed. Daisaburo Hashizume Former Zenkyoto member Let me elaborate on what Akuta means. For him art is above everything. He has a primal drive to create liberated zones. Because Akuta believes humanity has become corrupt and tainted. It's warped and damaged and can't be left like that. That's not the human truth. To restore what makes humanity distinct. And restore our primal condition. We need a zone where we're liberated and that's what art is. We may fail but that doesn't make our attempt meaningless. Akuta wanted to say to Mishima that he lacked faith in his art so how could he call himself an artist? Keiichiro Hirano Novelist That was a very remarkable scene. Mishima gave a lot of thought to the issue of "persistence." His novels are characterized with moments of ecstasy. His characters might dream of a momentary achievement. They rarely spent decades achieving their goal. Your action falls short. Everything concludes within relationality, without actuality. Indeed. Inherently words can not affect actual material. So I take actions in the attempt to But as long as you can write you don't have to try demagogy with other activities. Your writing is autonomous so But I'm saying that I'm not content with an autonomous space. I think you're just bluffing! Ogawa, a TBS reporter, was covering the debate from the front row. Kunio Ogawa (75) Former TBS Reporter There's this man who came in with a baby. Everyone in the hall responded strongly to it. I still remember how it lightened the tense atmosphere. Mishima spoke with a lot of humor. My overall impression of the debate was that it progressed in an unexpected direction. I was so engaged in the whole thing. Armed with unique arguments, Akuta didn't hesitate to criticize Mishima. Why do all writers write like critics today? The answer relates to where you are and what you see. And you, Mishima. We're at a university but if we deny relationality of all objects we can't answer the question. We won't even be able to call this a desk. There'd be no Lecture Hall 900... So we pretend that everything is unavoidably related so that we can invert that relationality. That's why we make barricades, to deny relationality. Then we'd have to define everything in relation to a new viewpoint. Next time we stage a blockade, there'll be many Blanquists. It'll be the era of agitators and demagogues. A revolution on a national scale might fail but those who are both Blanquists and Trotskyists will succeed. Then we'd deal with time's actual persistence, as you mentioned. Then it'll be a form of fiction that would dominate in the end. That's why I do theater. It's one or the other. Your book, Sun and Steel is what I call "The testicle's spirit." Sun and Steel (1968) A semi-autobiographical essay It's about distribution of values. Excess produce allows a hippy like me to make a baby, with no job. Distribution is unequal to objects and people. Sun and Steel points to that in an infantile way. Proper distribution of values can't be realized with our consciousness. We exist. Objects exist. Sartre's understanding of image is obsolete. What we have to do is transcend image with objects. We tend to see things as images because it's easier. We try to deal with things with our eyes closed. Light helps us see beyond an object. The first step is to realize anything around you is a weapon. A glass, at a glance, can be a weapon. It's easier. Some people prefer that. Is your body a weapon? You have to pursue that potential. What lies between objects and us? I can't see anything. There's supposed to be a nation and people in power but I can't see them. So that's where I want to start. That was very interesting. I have 2 questions. One is when nothing has a name. Names are a form of continuation so without them could we be relationally defined? And also we exist, objects exist and we use them. But can we disregard the teleological point of view? When we see a spoon we see its purpose which is to eat food with. "Can we use things without purpose?" is the question. Answering the 1st question. Should things be relational? Not necessarily. It depends. I mean, why do unnamed objects end up relational only to be transcended again? Because we rely on the walker called civilization. That's exactly how Trotsky failed. Keiichiro Hirano Novelist Let's say Akuta managed to create a liberated zone... if he really wanted to change society, he'd have to rely on words to systematically change it. Without words we have no assessment and ability to procure food. If each object or phenomenon had no name the system couldn't persist with no logical organization. That's why Mishima asked about persistency. If you want your creation to persist you need words. In that sense, what Mishima did with words has actuality. Masahiko Akuta Former Zenkyoto member In a liberated zone, you'd also be liberated from time. It's dangerous to think that time is absolute. You mean, history? History and also power. A man in power sees things his way. Right? Only Mishima would be happy to be trapped in an unliberated time. An audience member yelled, "It's all philosophical nonsense!" "I'm here to see Mishima get beaten up!" Go on then. Don't just say that from back there... Come up here if you want to beat him! Come on! - Come on! - Right here. Go ahead! Beat him. Don't back off. Who do you want? Me? - Not you. - I'm game. - Generally - Use the mic! By abstracting relationality with no boundaries you're just toying with ideas. When there is Man We inevitably have the Other. How you formulate an argument is Relationality is obscenity, moron! Turning relations upside down is revolutionary! No. Existential relations in actual society come first. You have to build your argument on them, expanding your consciousness. - But you do it by rejecting - Boring! the spatial coexistence of the Other. You give Zenkyoto a bad name! Don't call yourself a member. Let me rephrase the point of the argument. We acknowledge actual relations. On that condition, when we focus on objects... When we focus on relationality and we behave... as active subjects we can't ignore actual relations. Masahiko Akuta Former Zenkyoto member I had 2 Short Peace cigarettes. Mishima had 4. I finished mine so I took one of his. We smoked 3 each. I meant to return it but... Media and World Revolution In 1968 many political movements were underway May '68 in Paris all across the world. The Prague Spring The televised accounts spread The American civil rights movement across the world which roused the activists. Protesting against the US Army Oji Field Hospital Eiji Oguma (56) Sociologist Author of 1968 In my opinion, if television didn't exist in 1968 the University of Tokyo student riots wouldn't have gained national attention. Because the riots were at the University of Tokyo it attracted the attention of the news media. If it had been elsewhere, it wouldn't have been newsworthy. The news media was present in Lecture Hall 900. Osamu Kimura Former Zenkyoto member I had been interviewed by TBS. That's why I asked them to come. The University of Tokyo graduates have their futures mapped out. But I reject that because it's unfair to taxpayers. They brought in a powerful light for their camera. It was blinding. Kunio Ogawa Former TBS Reporter Student activism attracted national attention so we created a team to cover it. The crew would ask the students about their intentions. Mishima called Shinchosha Publishing. They sent a photographer named Hiroshi Shimizu. Hiroshi Shimizu (84) Photographer I entered from the right and crossed the stage behind Mishima. Then I closed in on him from the left. I got him to look at my camera. He was very conscious of the camera, as if to say "Go on, shoot more." So I instinctively snapped more photos. So the monumental occasion was recorded. Mishima had a lot of media exposure so he knew the power of media. He knew how to dazzle people with his looks. Mishima's strength was his use of photos and the printed word. Eiji Oguma Sociologist They enhanced his image as a great literary figure. He was a world renowned author who also worked out. He was also anti-intellectual so young people thought he was cool. "Mishima: Japan's dandiest man. Toshiro Mifune: 2nd place" Shiine was Mishima's editor so they knew each other very well. Yamato Shiine (77) Mishima's editor at Heibon Punch magazine He recounts his first meeting with Mishima. I'd arrived at the Imperial Hotel first so I waited for him. When he entered the ballroom, 100 guests turned to look at him. All eyes were on Mishima. There was total silence. The clink of cutlery on plates suddenly stopped and everyone focused on Mishima. That's how he was. He was a star. Jakucho Setouchi (97) Novelist/Buddhist monk Mishima's friend Before she became a novelist she wrote Mishima fan letters through which they became friends. He wrote me back and explained why. He said it was because he found my letters interesting. So I tried to make each letter more interesting. He had a great sense of humor. I could tell he was a genius. I have never seen such lively eyes as his! He was very lean and slight but he had this power. I'd never seen eyes like his. When I looked at him I saw the eyes of a genius. Chapter 3 Mishima and the Emperor Kosaka, a Zenkyoto member made a bold move by directing the debate towards Mishima's views on the Emperor. What is the Emperor to Mishima and the nation to us? I think we'll get somewhere on that topic. For example, quite seriously On Emperor For example, quite seriously when you guys barricaded off Yasuda Auditorium if you'd mentioned "Emperor" just once I'd have joined your cause. Gladly. I'm not kidding. I always say this. The direct democracy of the 1920s and the 30s...that's not right. The principles of imperial sovereignty and direct democracy are almost identical. It's a fantastical concept but there is one thing both systems have in common. I'll tell you what it is. The people without going through any system of authority, dreamed of being one with the nation. There were coups before WWII to achieve this but they failed. Before WWII, the word, "Emperor" prefaced intentions. You don't have it today. You think it'd serve no purpose. Have you thought about how the word "Emperor" affects Japan's lower class? If you think about it, the word, "Emperor" is unambiguous. It might make the impossible possible. I guess it's clear that when I mention the "Emperor" it isn't His Majesty who I have in mind as that entity. - I want to change that. - He's the establishment! Good point! - To do it - Bandits should die in prison! That's true. However I, the Emperor, have plenty to eat. Only communists would say such a vulgar thing. Yes, the people you don't like. The Emperor is not as bourgeois as you'd assume. If he was bourgeois, your revolution would've been easier. That's why it's difficult. Both you and I struggle with the same difficulty. It involves all social classes. Is the solution's name, Emperor? I don't know, but I call it that. None of us will succeed unless we understand this. To him, the Emperor represented power. He saw it as a way of bringing salvation to Japan. As an embodiment of Japanese culture. Culminating with the Emperor. A source of energy that compels us unconsciously. A symbol that would be the focus of energy. A political symbol, I suppose. Mishima called it "the Emperor." You think what I do is embarrassing. Wearing military gear and training with SDF soldiers. But to me, you're just as embarrassing, dressed like cleaners. I believe that your action is just as invalid as mine. Killing one another might bring validity. If this is the time, we'll do that. That'd be the only way for us to reach a conclusion. Survivor's guilt Those born in the 1930s all shared similar issues. They were teenagers when Japan lost the war. Boys were resigned to dying in the war. They grew up accepting that's how their life would be. In their childhood, the fate of the nation was tied to their own. But that ended on August 15, 1945. Suddenly you and the nation were separate entities. Japan lost its sovereignty and was subordinate to America. Tatsuru Uchida Professor emeritus at Kobe College They want it how it was before. Their own fate was synchronized with that of the nation. It gave them a sense of elation. They missed that euphoria and wanted to experience it again. Keiichiro Hirano Novelist Mishima spent his teenage years towards the end of WWII. Many of Mishima's contemporaries sacrificed their lives for the Emperor. He wondered about his role as a survivor, which became his theme. In his 30s Mishima made a tremendous effort to adapt to the transforming post-war society. Then in his 40s he started to think about the Emperor again. He reconsidered the Emperor's role and had a paradigm shift. He used to think that the Emperor presented an obstruction to reality. But then he saw that inherent conflict with reality could be used as a basis to criticize reality. Japanese culture as symbolized by the Emperor could be used to criticize post-war corruption in Japan. That was Mishima's new viewpoint in his 40s. That's why he told the students to consider what the Emperor stands for, before criticizing reality. Eiji Oguma Sociologist The student activists could only laugh in reaction. Why was that? It was so abrupt that they didn't even feel disturbed. Laughing released their tension as they didn't know how to respond. I think that's how it was. The mortal Emperor is just a political symbol in his role now. Your point is...? So I want Emperors to restore the divine roots of the past. I want to restore how it was back then. And you want to be at one with that ethos? Yes. That's onanistic, of image and the self. You'd be defenseless against objects. Let me tell you about Japanese culture You can't transcend being Japanese. - That's OK. - Is it? I am Japanese. I was born that way and I'll die that way. I don't want to go beyond that. I don't. - You might pity me for that - I do. - As a Japanese - It's fantasy. I don't want to be anything besides Japanese. So where is this object known as Japanese? Go abroad and you'll find it. If you're fluent in English, you forget that you're Japanese. You see a reflection of a man in a shop window with a long torso and a flat nose. There's a Japanese...it's me! Every time I go abroad But that's impossible unless you're an object. To escape your nationality? You don't have nationality. In that case, you are free which I admire. But I can't escape my nationality as Japanese. I think it's my fate. You can't escape what you're related to. Nor history. - No, I'd rather - Stay in history? I find it delightful. - In a fantasy? - Yes. You take action only after you kill someone. - But maybe you won't. - I agree. I've come to have that mentality. I'm leaving. I'm bored. Sorry. See you. Let's discuss perception further. Mr. Mishima said beauty goes beyond time and space Tatsuru Uchida Professor emeritus at Kobe College He was very earnest about persuading those 1,000 students. Mishima remained very fair to the students. He never tried to corner them or trick them with rhetoric or point out their contradictions. That can't be underrated. Mishima and young people Mishima sought out young people's company around this time. He attended debates at universities. And he trained, interacted and ate with the Shield Society. Yutaka Shinohara Former Shield Society member He threw himself into whatever he did. We were around 20 whereas he was in his 40s. We had more stamina than him but he trained as hard as us no matter how intense it was. Often he did better than any of us young members. Hara Mishima Shinohara Miyazawa He never went easy on himself. We were drawn to his integrity. Yukitomo Miyazawa Former Shield Society member Let me explain my impression of Mr. Mishima. I'd heard that he disliked young people. But then I learned that wasn't true at all. It was impressionable young people that he didn't like. Those who were susceptible to trends. Followers. He didn't like young people without personal awareness. Shiine, Mishima's editor for Heibon Punch mocked Mishima's swordsmanship in an article. Mishima's response surprised him. Yamato Shiine I wrote that he was only as good as the 1st dan. That his 4th dan ranking was just honorary. The moment the magazine was out he phoned me. With no mention of my article, he invited me to kendo practice. I said OK and he offered to be my kendo mentor. So we practiced at Himonya dojo for 150 minutes every Sunday for 2 years. Akihiro Hara Former Shield Society member We'd go to the dojo at Itabashi Police Department. To practice. After every practice we went to a sushi restaurant in front of the police station. I was a university student so it was a luxury that I couldn't normally afford. Big fatty tuna... on rice. A lot of it! I'd never had anything so delicious. He treated us after every practice. Yukitomo Miyazawa Former Shield Society member He said that we were inexperienced with women so we met him at a designated place. We wondered what it was... Then we arrived to find that he'd invited many stewardesses to join us! We had no uniforms then... He stayed with us all night. Sometimes he showed a strict side. Yutaka Shinohara Former Shield Society member There was a guy who wrapped his torso with a cloth and died after stabbing himself in the heart. He was my schoolmate's friend. So I told the story to Mr. Mishima. He asked me why he killed himself. I told him maybe because he had a nervous breakdown. That enraged him. "That's what everyone says when they commit suicide!" "It's never that easy!" he shouted. He was red with anger. Jakucho Setouchi was Mishima's friend I think he was very fond of young people. He was gentle. The way he looked at them... He listened to them carefully and responded earnestly. He was a gentle soul. Mishima talked about something unexpected. At the risk of being mocked by you please hear me out. When I was young the war started. His memory of the Emperor I saw the Emperor sit perfectly still for 3 hours on a stage. It was at my graduation. He was like a statue. And he gave me a silver watch. When Mishima graduated from Gakushuin as a valedictorian he received a silver watch from the Emperor. So I feel a connection. I didn't want to tell you this but that's my personal history. I can't deny its impact. The Emperor was so regal. Mishima was emotionally ambivalent about the Showa Emperor. In the debate and in The Voices of the Heroic Dead he had critical things to say about the Emperor. The Voices of the Heroic Dead (1966) Soldier spirits put a curse on the Emperor Keiichiro Hirano Novelist On the other hand he repeatedly talked about how the Emperor was absolutely still at Mishima's school and how impressive it was. His ambivalence makes it hard to relate to his story. But when Mishima was a boy, the Emperor did have an impact on him. That impression stayed with him all those years. Then Kosaka struck back. He said that if everyone shared the concept of "Emperor" then the concept wouldn't need a name. Emperor as a concept My logic is consistent so I demand an answer. I recognize that you're being logical but I follow persistence, not logic. I've come this far so... I won't budge. You didn't defeat me with logic. I kept saying "Emperor" and if you'd said "Emperor" I'd have joined you. But you didn't, so I have to keep saying "fight to death." Tatsuru Uchida Professor emeritus at Kobe College Mishima knew that their political differences weren't the issue. The Zenkyoto movement was less left-wing than the Communist and Socialist Parties. So it wasn't really about "right" or "left." Their activism in 1968 and 1969 was an extension of protests against Japan's Security Treaty with US. It was anti-US patriotism. Mishima was an insightful man so he knew that the student activists were nationalists. They had that in common. Masahiko Akuta Former Zenkyoto member I guess it was never about who was left or right-wing. Mishima was upset because the right-wingers turned to America. He considered joining Zenkyoto because we both wanted independence. But on the ridiculous condition that we accept his Emperor. If it wasn't about being right or left who was your mutual enemy? It was... the ambiguous and obscene Japan. They thought they were mortal enemies but they were fighting a mutual enemy. Final Chapter Passion After discussing various topics the debate was coming to an end. Let's conclude the debate. We'll ask Mr. Mishima his thoughts and wrap up today's debate. And then I'd like to ask a personal favor, Mr. Mishima. I want you to join our cause. Remember what you told us. If we'd responded to you and said "Emperor" you'd join us. He continued. He said that he'd mentioned "Emperor" in the debate so if Mishima was to keep his word he should join Zenkyoto and fight together. What you've said has impressed me deeply. In terms of deconstructing established concepts I've been a part of it for a long time with my literature. And now you treat me as an embodiment of established concepts. That makes me feel... Happy? No, but whatever it is I feel it. In regard to you mentioning the word "Emperor" it shows the spiritual effect of words. For you, saying the word "Emperor" aloud was despicable but during the 2-hour long debate many of you repeated "Emperor," whatever the intention. My word flew in the hall with wings and invited your words. I don't know how the spirit of my word resonated with you but I leave now with the resonance of the word. It's a question unanswered. I believe in your passion, if nothing else. I believe in it and I want you to understand that. Will you join our cause? Will you? That question is mere sophistry. I'm very tempted but I refuse to join you. That concludes it. Mishima leaving Lecture Hall 900 "Meeting Zenkyoto members" "was pleasurable," Mishima wrote in an article. He directly took on the 1,000 student activists. Daisaburo Hashizume Former Zenkyoto member This big name in the literary world called Yukio Mishima came to visit us. He came to our turf to have a debate with us. To see who'd win the argument or be persuaded. And he did it very seriously. We had different opinions but he was very respectful. I'm sure everyone felt that it was a big present. Yukitomo Miyazawa Former Shield Society member He said that it was exciting. He kept saying that. He sounded very satisfied. Tatsuru Uchida Professor emeritus at Kobe College He said he believed in their passion. He had a big expectation of the students. He wanted them to come closer to his point of view. He invited them in, in his provocative way. Like he confessed his love to them. Keiichiro Hirano Novelist Ultimately we need words to change society. Only words can modify the system of a society. The debaters explored the meaning of words... That was the most significant aspect of the debate. It's remarkable that they didn't stick to one side of the argument or antagonize their opponent. They acknowledged when their opponent had a point. They admitted when they didn't quite get it. With objectivity we can help each other present our thoughts and ideas. Masahiko Akuta Former Zenkyoto member I was an artist more than a student. And I was proud to be an artist. And him... He earned his place in this world, no matter how vulgar it is. With a pencil. And yet... He empathized with our ideals despite our differences. A conversation requires respect. You can't engage with someone you hate. Words were more powerful in connecting people in those days. - Like media? - Yes. Kimura, the MC, called Mishima a while after the debate. And he received an unexpected proposition. He asked me to join the Shield Society. And I didn't answer in a straightforward manner. I was making excuses about our different political views. But I didn't just say "No." I remember I couldn't be honest. I was evasive. And Mr. Mishima was sharp! He asked me, "Where are you?" He guessed that I was with someone. I was with the woman I would marry. So I told him that I was calling from my girlfriend's place. He told me to hand her the phone and they spoke for 5 minutes. My wife didn't tell me what they talked about. Only recently, after nearly 50 years of marriage she remembered what Mishima told her. He asked her if she loved me. And she answered that she did. She never told me that! I had to wait 50 years. November 25, 1970 One and a half years after the debate Listen to me! Mishima took the commanding general hostage at Ichigaya Camp to persuade the 1,000 SDF soldiers to join his cause in a coup and revise the Constitution. The soldiers ignored his appeal. Mishima hailed the Emperor and committed ritual suicide. A Shield member who'd guarded him at the debate also killed himself. Morita was his name. Masakatsu Morita Shield Society member The two of them committed suicide. - Where? - In the Commandant's office. They both killed themselves. How? Did they slash their stomachs? Yutaka Shinohara Former Shield Society member No one... No one thought that would happen at that time. Akihiro Hara Former Shield Society member I was listening to the radio when they went to Ichigaya Camp to carry it out. I was like, "What?" I was so shocked I returned to Tokyo immediately. Osamu Kimura Former Zenkyoto member He often said that he'd die when the time came. So... I was told by someone that I was pale... like I'd seen a ghost. Jakucho Setouchi Novelist/Buddhist monk I was shocked and I thought what a waste of talent... I cried. Yamato Shiine Mishima's editor What can I say... I wasn't disappointed or sad. All I felt was... Emptiness. That everything had gone... Masahiko Akuta Former Zenkyoto member Mishima had a headband on. I thought he was up to his silly stuff. Then he died. I thought, "Good." Good? His wish had come true! That was his finale and he'd done it right. At Lecture Hall 900 on that day Mishima actually prophesied his future. If I were to act, it would have to be illegal as it is for you. If I took someone's life in a duel, it'd be murder. In that case I'd kill myself before I was arrested. He killed himself in the apolitical mood of 1970 in the wake of Osaka Expo's success. The New Left groups feuded among themselves resulting in the Asama mountain lodge siege. After that, radical activism lost its momentum and the Zenkyoto movement was defeated. How did the members reflect on their activism? Kunio Ogawa Former TBS Reporter I wonder that, too. I'd love to ask your interview subjects. Kunio Ogawa Former TBS Reporter What did those revolutionaries think about the whole thing? I'm fascinated to know. I'd like to ask them. Tatsuru Uchida Professor emeritus at Kobe College In taverns in the mid 70s, young drunk office workers would grumble that they used to be revolutionaries. Probably 90% of those eager activists grew out of it and got ahead with a slight sense of guilt. I don't know what they were thinking. What moral code they followed and what they made of their youth is a mystery to me. Some describe it as a "defeat." Osamu Kimura Former Zenkyoto member I don't think so, in general it was just that it dispersed. It took me years. For a while... I kept asking myself, "What am I doing with my life?" Osamu Kimura Former Zenkyoto member Any movement eventually ends in success or failure. It ends but those who participated in it will go on. Society goes on. The results of a social movement might disappoint its participants. It might make them feel defeated or ruin their lives. They might look back and play down its significance. Some might find other things to pursue in their lives. There's not one way to deal with its results but they should remember what happened. How can you remember it if you're dead? It didn't end with Zenkyoto members killing themselves. If a battle ends in inevitable loss we have to ponder what we'll do after that. I'm dealing with it in my own way. Masahiko Akuta Former Zenkyoto member It was generally regarded as a defeat Who cares how you regard it in your country! Not in my country. I'm living proof. I exist in my country. I don't exist in your country. You're proof because I'm here, breathing. I'm speaking here, I'm not imitating anyone. You see? Lecture Hall 900 is still standing. On that day the hall was filled with Mishima's, the Zenkyoto debaters' and the 1,000 audience members' passion, respect and words. How will you confront the world and choose to live? They explored meaning by exchanging words. 50 years have passed. What would Mishima say to us if he was here today? I believe in your passion, if nothing else. I believe in it and I want you to understand that. Times change but what remains is a passion to improve. All we need is passion, respect and words. That's the truth we found in Lecture Hall 900, 50 years later. Osamu Kimura became a civil servant for a Tokyo ward. Now retired, he mulls over the mystery of Mishima's death. Shuhei Kosaka became a cram school lecturer and wrote philosophy books. He died at 60 in 2007 from acute heart failure. Masahiko Akuta is a director for Homofictus theatre troupe. Multi-talented Akuta still writes, directs, performs and dances. Yukio Mishima died in 1970 at 45. The members of the Shield Society hold a memorial for Mishima and Masakatsu Morita every year on November 25.
