They're gone, I don't know where they are. You don't know? Go! Talk, where are they? - I don't know! - You don't know? Oh, really? No... Brother, are you all right? Hit him, hit him till he's dead! I'm begging you, stop hitting him! - Stop hitting him! - What a fool. You should've just handed it over! You forced me to do this. Give it back, that belongs to my late mother! I could care less about this fragrance pouch! I just wanted all of you to remember. Whatever I, Wu Dai-hoi, want, I always get! Let's go! Brother! I swear that Wu Dai-hoi is gonna pay one day! Don't be silly, the Wu Family is rich. We're no match for them, that's fate. But it's not my fate! I will learn kung-fu at Shaolin. You just wait. By the time we meet again, no one will dare bully you two! The martial arts studies of Shaolin Temple has had a long history, from Master Dharma to the splitting of South Shaolin from the North. In few hundred years, many famous masters came from Shaolin. Shaolin Kung-fu is a mixture of martial arts and Buddhism, the Shaolin Temple spreads the spirit and established its important role in history of Martial arts. The importance and effects of Shaolin Kung-fu will follow the Yellow River which shall never ends. "Sakyamuni Buddha" "Golden Bell" "Shaolin Temple" Amazing! You're amazing, brother! - You're great, brother! - Awesome! Brother, your Hung Fist stance is of the highest caliber! You'd have to teach me someday. Do you know Leung's specialty? - What's that? - It's the Iron Arm stance! When he stretches his two arms, they'll be like two iron rods! Even a real iron rod can't hurt him! Are you serious? Please show us, Leung! Oh, no. No way, it's nothing like that! It's nothing special. Nothing to show off, really. But I've already said it, Leung, you've got to show us to save my face! Show us, please! - Just show us a few moves! - Please show us! Keep going! Come on, guys! Come! Come on! Keep going! Brothers, are you all right? Leung Kwun! You learned Shaolin kung fu to protect, not to show off at will. I can strike fear in enemy's heart by showing my kung fu, and perhaps a fight can be avoided. If we can avoid a fight, then why must I hide my kung-fu and wait for my enemy to attack me? Isn't that a bit redundant? Nonsense! How dare you talk back? All those years of studying buddhism means nothing for lyou? Go and face the wall as punishment! Why? I was just telling the truth! You! You're asking for it! You're bad at both learning and talking. With these moves of yours, who do you think you can protect? Stop! Leung Kwun. Come with me. Master, I know I was wrong. Wrong about what? I shouldn't have showed off my kung-fu, and I shouldn't have disrespected Uncle Wai Ian by fighting him. You will leave the temple tomorrow. What did you say, Master? Since the very first day you arrived here, I knew this day would come sooner or later. That's why I insisted on you being a scholar monk, and refuse to shave your head. Now go. But always remember, good and evil are only a thought's away. Amitabha. You may not be an official Shaolin disciple, but you must always have benevolence in mind, and never try to take one's life. I hope you shall alway bear in mind. "Shaolin Temple" Brother! Hand over the Ultimate Venom manual and you will die a quick death! This manual belongs to our Venom Valley, why should we hand it over to you? I am not negotiating with you. If you won't hand it over, I'll look for it over your dead bodies then. Kill them both! - Are you all right? - I'm fine. Get me the Worm-Repellent Powder! What's that? The Worm-Repellent Powder? That's impossible! Do you really think that there is no one using black magic but the Miao Family alone? Let's see what other tricks are up your sleeves! Go! Another one asking for death? Don't you know who I am? I don't care who you are! Where did you idiots all come from? What a bunch of bullies, you should be ashamed! Ashamed? Kill him! Retreat! Go! Thank you for your assistance! You're too kind, just lending a hand. Why were they coming after you? They're going after my master's... We were on our way to Canton. They tried to rob us so they started coming after us. Thanks again for your help! I see. I'm Leung Kwun. You said that you're heading for Canton? That's where my home is. If the two of you won't mind, at least you'll have a companion. Great! Leung, with you coming along, they wouldn't dare come after us. Leung, my sister is young and naive. The fact is that by rescuing us just now, you have offended Man Kwai Clan. So we don't dare to have you join us, let's just bid farewell and go our own ways. Farewell... "Comforting gentle breeze" - Enjoy yourself. - Thanks... - What a nice place. - Yeah, this is the best around. "Yuet Lai Teahouse" - Miss, a fragrance bag? - No need. Fragrance bag? Fragrance bag for sale, come check them out, ladies! See if anything interests you, Miss. Miss Bai, not only are you pretty, whatever fancies you is attractive to others too. How much for the hairpin? I'll buy it. You are a man of good taste, Young Master Wu. This hairpin was made from the finest jade stone and sculpted by a famous sculptor. If it's someone else, then it would be 5 taels. But since it's you, Young Master Wu, 3 taels will be fine. What do you think? How much? It's my gift to Young Master Wu. Why, you shouldn't. Here, let me put it on you. Get away from me. How dare you! Let's go! You're asking for trouble! Don't be afraid, Miss Bai. We're only acting on Young Master Wu's orders to invite you to his place for a drink. I'm not interested. Excuse me. Miss Bai, I'm warning you. If you don't want to go on your own, then forgive us for being offensive. Let me go! What are you looking at? You're asking for trouble, kid! Don't you know who I am? And you want to hit me too? Come on! Try touch me if you dare! Master! Like I said, I vow not to let anyone bully you when we meet again. I will learn kung-fu at Shaolin. You just wait. By the time we meet again, no one will dare bully you two! You are Leung? It's really you! You've finally come back! It's me. I'm back. How dare you! I work for the Wu family, how dare you hit me? You must be tired of living! Wu Dai Hoi is your master? Of course, are you scared? Perfect, go tell him. He better be good from now on. Don't think that just being rich, he can act like a rascal. Otherwise, my fists will be waiting for him! Who do you think you are? Hey, I am not your messenger! Hit him! Go! Looks like you want some more of this? I'll go back and let my master know. Scram! I'll take you to see my brother. He'll be very happy to see that you're back. - Great! - Come on. You two go follow them, and find out where they live. - Go! - Yes! Brother! What is it? You scared me! Look who's back? Bai. It's me, Leung Kwun. I am back. Leung Kwun? It is you! That's great! Brother. Now that we're reunited, isn't it about time for you to take out your treasured Osmanthus wine to celebrate with us? Right! We'll drink until we're drunk! - Come on! - Good, let's go! It's so good that you're back. Watch out and be quiet. - Come on, quiet. - Let's go... Quiet. - You sure this is the place? - I'm sure. There... Here! Here too! It's on fire! Leung, Lin! What to do? It's on fire! Let's escape! - Let's go! - They're out! Careful! Bai, take care of her. Leung Kwun, be careful! Now this is the good life. Am I right, old friend? Hurry! Run! Move! Who's there? Someone is always here to ruin my mood whenever I want to drink in peace. Run! Why did you come to disturb me? Master, I'm being chased, that's why I came to bother you. Master, please help and save my life! Hey, Mister. If you can forgive someone, please feel free to do it. Forbearance will bring you calm, and stepping back will bring you peace. What a powerful arm! Then you should back off! I, Leung Kwun, do not fight the innocent. But I like to mind others' business! If someone asks me for help, it's hard for me to refuse! He's the bad guy! And I don't think you're a good guy either! I haven't met such an opponent in a while! Interesting! Leung, Master So! Why are you two fighting? - You knew him? - You knew each other? On our way here, we were attacked by Man Kwai Clan. Thanks to Leung's help, we were able to escape. Leung, was this some kind of misunderstanding? Why were you two fighting? That man came to burn my house down who wanted to kill us all. I chased him to here and this guy got in my way! Master So? It is the wine, wine always causes problems. That's fine, I'll take care of him. You despicable... He ran away. Don't worry, he won't go far. Every time I see all these insects, I get itches all over myself! Yan Fung, Did your master actually tell you how to break these black magic? Yes. It seems that you have important things to discuss, then I better take my leave now. Leung! Young man. Your kung fu is pretty good and you've saved the two of them, so you're on our side. Will you be interested in hearing our big plan? You can go ahead. Our master has received Master So's message that Man Kwai Clan plans to use black magic to control all martial artists. But about their Soul Departing Spell, we don't know anything. However, most voodoo works the same way. Besides, our Ultimate Secret Poison Manual is known as the origin of all black magic, which should be sufficient to fight his spell. Master ordered us to give this manual to Master So and to assist him in crushing Man Kwai Clan's plan and to help those controlled by that spell. Good. Now that you knew our plan, will you be interested in helping us to eliminate Man Kwai Clan for the martial arts world? Sorry, I learned kung fu to protect the ones around me. As if for the martial arts world, I'm not interested. Goodbye. - Leung! - Forget it. One day, he'll find out that he can't run away from this. "Hu's Mansion" Who did this to you? It was that Leung Kwun! Leung Kwun? That one who's always hanging around with Bai Xiao? He's back? You're so embarrassing, how could you let that nobody mess you up like this? Looks like we'll need to teach Leung a lesson. How dare he beating the men of Hu! He should've known who the master is before beating up the dog! Young master, Leung Kwun also has a message for you. He said you better watch yourself and stop acting like a hound. How dare you, Leung Kwun! I think you're tired of living! Men! Young Master. Inform everyone here at the mansion. Gear up tomorrow morning, we're going to beat a dog! I was hoping to have you try my treasured osmanthus wine, who could have thought that... What a pity! There'll be plenty of chances for the three of us! Leung, are you sure that it was Wu Wai who set the fire? That's right, only the Wu Family could have done something so despicable. Yes, and they'll come back for revenge! I was responsible for all this, I'm the one you want. Leave the two of them alone! If Bai Xiao is willing to come with us today, then I will think about letting you live. Young Master Wu! Leung Kwun has just got back here, he doesn't know the rules. I'll make sure he learns his lesson. I am asking you for mercy that great man forgets others' pettiness. And who do you think you are? Asking me for mercy? Fine, on your knees! - I am begging you! - Brother! As long as you cand let them go, I'll do anything! - I'm begging you! - Bai, get up! Brother! Young Master Wu! - Get up! - Come on up! There is gold underneath every man's knees, he doesn't deserve this kneel from you! Leung Kwun. Long time no see, it seems like you've grown an attitude! Have you forgotten how I used to press you on ground and beat you? I haven't, that's why I'll return the favour today. Gutsy, how about this? If you can take ten moves from me, then I'll forget about you beating up my counsellor. Otherwise, you'll have to kneel down and lick my shoes. Deal? Forget it, come on! Why are you all still standing there? Get him! This is not over, you just watch! - Leung, how're your hands? - They're fine. Who could've thought that your kung-fu is so powerful now? I've told you. By the time we meet again, no one will dare bully you two! A promise is a promise. You're all garbage! So many of you and you couldn't even handle a penniless kid! What is it now? Father! You're just going to allowed your son being bullied? I'll count my blessings if you stop bullying first! Master, it was our fault today that Young Master was being beat up. He deserves it! This will let him know that there are better fighters out there! Father, your son was assaulted and you have lost face! Get the constables and put Leung into jail now! Nonsense! Look how impatient you are, how can I feel confident enough to pass my family business onto you? For the next few days, stay home and think about what you've done. Master. Watch over him for me! Yes, Master. I, Wu Dai-hoi, swear to kill Leung Kwun! I think a plan is needed to get rid of him. Look at you, you've got a plan? Lady. Sir, how much for this? This hairpin? Lady, I think this hairpin is perfect for you. I'll give you a deal, 3 taels. No thanks. I'll give you a better deal if you buy it. No need, let's go. Lady, the price is negotiable! Why didn't you buy it? Don't you like it? I do, but it's too expensive. Perhaps things like that aren't meant for poor people like us. Come on, let's go get some carrots. I'll make you some delicious dishes tonight! Great! - Go! - Run! What's with them? The Wu family is giving free food again. Come, let's check it out. - Yeah, that's real... - Come on, everyone can have a share! - Queue up, everyone can have it! - Thank you so much! What are they doing? You're not gonna believe this. Wu Dai-hoi may be a bully, but his father Wu Ching-wan is a big philanthropist. He gives out free food all the time and even help fixes houses, the common folks respect him highly. Hard to believe a philanthropist would have such a prodigal son! I recognise you two, you're Wu Dai-hoi's servants! Yes... Relax. I won't give you guys a hard time, you're only following orders. Thank you so much for the free food, Master Hu. - Thank you... - Next. Brother, I want some porridge! Here you go, little girl. - Thank you! - You're welcome. Looks like you can be a potential philanthropist too. I just feel that she needs it more than me. We can't leave our philanthropist with an empty stomach, right? Let's go, I'll take you to eat our best lotus seed buns. Great! - Leung? - Yes? I've meant to ask you. Are you staying this time? Will you go back to Shaolin? I studied kung-fu there to protect those who mean the most to me. Well, they're right here now, so why would I go back? You mean... you'll be staying with me and my brother? Yes. Like I said, I have to protect you two. I won't let the two of you be harassed anymore. Never ever. Let's have some buns! - Straight ahead! - Great! Sir, here are your buns. - Enjoy. - Okay. - Good? - Delicious! I told you, see? Have some more! Buns for you, sir? Master So! Someone is down. The Soul Departing Spell again, this is the fifth case for this month already. Looks like Man Kwai Clan is getting more and more reckless! Master So. Take a look! What exactly is Man Kwai Clan up to? If we don't get rid of him, blood will be shed sooner or later in the martial arts world. By then, even if you want no part of it, I'm afraid that it'll be out of your control. Why not reconsider my proposal to you last time? No. Fine. But you will change your mind one day. I'll wait for you. Bravo! Bravo, Master Leung! Master Leung, you're great... Why are you here? Didn't you have enough last time? Master Leung, last time was a misunderstanding! The thing is that after fighting with you last time, my master was very impressed with your martial arts skills! Therefore, he has arranged a banquet on his boat and asked me to take you there. One, so that he can apologise. And two, so he can befriend a hero like you! So, what do you think? Leung, Wu Dai-hoi is cunning. This could be a trap, you shouldn't go, no matter what. Even if it is a trap, I have to find out what tricks he has up his sleeves. Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'll be right back, you go home first. - Lead the way. - How heroic, please follow me! Think about it, Leung. We've known each other since childhood. If there were any misunderstandings, I hope this cup of wine will resolve them. Leung, this lake is the pride of this city. I've specifically asked the helmsman to take the boat to its centre, so that we can enjoy the view over this fine wine. Isn't that wonderful? To be honest, my past actions haven't been the nicest to you and to the Bai siblings. I was young and ignorant. Couldn't tell right from wrong. I just did whatever I felt like it, and you guys suffered as a result. Now, I really am remorseful. Thanks to my defeat to you, I realised there're people out there who are better than me. I thought my kung-fu was good, but compared to yours, it's nothing. But, Leung. Your kung-fu may be great and you're the envy of others, but you do have one fatal flaw. What's that? You trust people too easily. Human nature is hard to change! The world is more sinister than you think. Leung, we'll never meet again. Help, I can't swim! Young Master, help me! Young Master! Young Master! - Young Master! - Out of my way! - What happened? - Be careful. - Let's go! - What's wrong? Leung! I am really sorry, it's all my fault that I trusted that Wu Wai too easily. Otherwise, with our friendship, I wouldn't have hurt you no matter what. I'm begging you, please forgive me! Think about how long we've known each other, plessae let me go, I'm begging you! This will be the last time I give you a chance. Master Leung, please stop! Father! Father, save me! Save you? You shameless idiot! You've made Wu family lose face! I'll send you to confess your sins in front of your ancestors today! - Father! - Don't call me that! I don't have a son like you! Old Master, please reconsider! Young master may have been bad, but he doesn't deserve to die! He's the only heir of Wu Family, do you really want to take his life? - That's right, Master Hu! - Please forgive him! - Forgive him now! - Give him one more chance! - Don't do that, Master Hu. - Please think it over! Master Leung, I know my son has done things that are unforgivable. But, as I am in my twilight years, and that my son is my only heir, I hope you will be so kind as to spare his life. On behalf of my son, I am truly sorry. Master Wu. I am well aware of your philanthropy, I, Leung Kwun, am deeply impressed. Now that you've mentioned it, how can I refuse? Besides, I don't really hold a grudge with your son. I just hope that you can teach him not to go after the others and bully them at will. Thank you for your kindness, Master Leung. Give Master Leung your thanks now, hurry yp! Thank you, Master Leung. He should still be punished. Go home and think hard about what you've done! Let's go, Young Master. Master Leung, I take my leave now. Then, I'll come and give thanks to you some other day. Here, Leung! A toast to you! Cheers! Brother! Let me. You guys may not know about this. Because of this leg of mine, I've been looked down upon and humiliated. But now, thanks to having such a hero like Leung by my side? I think no one will despise me from now on. Bai Lin, I wanna ask for a favor and I hope you can do that for me. My dear brother, Leung. You're being too kind, just tell me what's on your mind. Can you teach me how to weave bamboo baskets? Hey, Leung! With that kung-fu skills of yours, you can apply to become a constable! Surely that's much better than a bamboo basket weaver! - Come on! - No that. All those fighting and killing are not my cup of tea, I just want to live a peace and stable life and spend my days with you and Xiao. Sure, I can teach you about weaving bamboo baskets. Thanks, Bai Lin! But this thing about living with me? I'll have to say no. After all, once you marry Bai Xiao, being a nuisance and hang around with you two all the time would not be appropriate, right? Brother, you're drunk again, stop saying that! Go get the things! Doctor, how's my son's injury? Luckily, thanks to the cut arm, the venom didn't travel further. But... But what? His injury is too severe, I'm afraid he's crippled for life. Thank you, doctor. Please collect your fee at the front hall. Leung Kwun, you've gone too far! I, Wu Ching-wan, will avenge for my son! Men! What is your command, master? Go find Izo Nakamura and Mian Zhen. Ask them to name a price to kill Leung Kwun, - I don't care how much! - Yes! - Boss? - Master Leung. I weaved this bamboo basket, please take alook! Oh, you're too kind, Master Leung! I have complete confidence in both you and your crafts! - Thanks, boss. - See you. Master So, what happened? - Help me, Leung! - Tell me. We finally found where Man Kwai Clan is hiding. We're planning to destroy it, but we fell into his trap! My brothers were either dead or seriously hurt. Leung, please go save them! Quick, tell me where they are now. - Take me there! - That way... Hurry, follow me! What do you want? Stay away from me, or I'm going to scream! Are you finally scared now? Let me go! I've told you. I, Wu Dai-hoi, always get whatever I want! If you had come with me earlier, I wouldn't end up like this today. You will learn today that I am a man of my words! Wu Dai-hoi, let me go! Put me down! Wu Dai-hoi, you idiot! Let me go! Hurry, we're almost there! Master So. The delicate jade wine bottle gourd that you hang by your waist, what happened to it? Probably lost it when I fought with Man Kwai Clan. Forget it, my men means more that that. - Let's keep going! - Wait! Why are you impersonating So Chan? Why brought me here? What are you plotting? What do you mean, Leung? I am So Chan, I'm not a fake! So Chan may love to drink, but he has never owned a jade wine bottle gourd. Who are you?? Androgyne with a thousand faces, the assassin with the golden needles. Meng Xian. I hold no grudges with you, who paid you to come after me? You know the rules, no assassin would ever reveal the employer. So you're still not leaving, right? Then don't blame me for having no mercy! Why aren't you attacking? You want to keep the reward to your own self? Xiao! Who are you? Aren't you Bai Lin? I heard you're elated about my broken arm and how Leung Kwun is protecting everyone, is that right? The wage of unjust is death. My only regret is that Leung Kwun should've chopped off your other arm too! You have no backbone! Kneel! Think hanging out with Leung Kwun hardens you? Let me go! Let him go. I want to see one who's used to kneeling can really get back up or not. Brother! - Xiao! - Let me go, Wu Dai-hoi! Leung won't forgive you for what you've done! Thanks for the reminder, I almost forgot! That Leung of yours is probably a skeleton at some unmarked grave by now! No, you're lying! I suggest that you accept reality. You belong to me now, surely that's better than hanging out with that penniless Leung! - You don't even begin to compare! - Hold her! - Get up! - Xiao! Let me go! Xiao! Either you come with me or I burn your brother to death, do you read me? Xiao! Xiao! All of you, let her go! Xiao. Xiao. Get off! Brother! Take him away! Brother! No! We Japanese Samurai do not kill those who're weaponless. Pull your sword! We are Chinese fighters won't use your Japanese weapons! You will regret your arrogance. We'll see about that! You have already defeated me, you can't take away my wish to kill my own self! Defeat is not shameful here, but motivates the loser to work even harder. One day, I will fight you again. Good, I'll wait for you. Before I kill you and redeem my honor, do not let yourself be killed. Goodbye. Bai Xiao, I'm back! Why not having the light on? It is so dark here. Bai Lin, are you asleep? Bai Lin! Bai Xiao! Bai Xiao! Bai Xiao! Bai Xiao! "Here lies Bai Xiao" "Here lies Bai Lin" "Hu's Mansion" Wu Dai-hoi! You come out here now! How dare you trespass here! Wu Dai-hoi, come out! Master Leung, Young master Wu really isn't here. Please go find him somewhere else. Where did he go? He hasn't been back in days, I really don't know where he is... Wu Dai-hoi! Father, how can you be so calm? That Leung Kwun has gone crazy and looking for me all over, who even swears that he'll turn me into ash! I'm afraid that Leung will be here sooner or later. You're afraid? This was all of your own doing. I hired killers to go after Leung Kwun, but you insisted on doing all these things on the side! How would I know that Leung guy would be so strong? Surrounded by two top assassins, yet he was still be able to survive! Father, what are we going to do now? I'm your only son, you won't want me to be our last family heir, right? Since Leung Kwun is looking for you, why don't we just simply tell him where you are? Father, are you crazy? "Ching-wan Clan" "Wu Dai-hoi is in Ching-wan Clan" Bring Wu Dai-hoi out now! Wu Dai-hoi? No such person here! Why are you trespassing here at Ching-wan Clan? I'll say again, bring me Wu now! I say what's wrong with you? Looking for someone for no reasons! Like my master told you, he's not here. Now scram! Stirring trouble here at Ching-wan Clan? You'll have to fight me! Master! Chief, are you all right? "Wu Dai-hoi is in Tin Kim Clan" "Wu Dai-hoi is in Hoi Sha Clan" Chief! Bad news, Chief. That public enemy Leung Kwun is here! Where is Wu Dai-hoi? Leung Kwun, just based on one letter, you believe that Wu Dai-hoi is here at Hoi Sa Clan? So our clan's reputation in the martial arts world is less worthy than some mysterious letter you got? I'll find out by searching here! Leung Kwun, how dare you insult our clan? You're too arrogant! Let our fists do the talking then! You! You want to stop me from revenge too? This is not revenge, this is making enemies! Such an obvious borrowed-murder plot and you couldn't see it? Say no more, you either fight me or step aside! I am telling you, don't just blindly fight everyone in front of you, Or you will never get your revenge and your reputation will be ruined! I don't want to hear you preach! Do you want to know where Wu Dai-hoi is? Come with me. "All goodness gathers here" "Man Kwai Clan" No rush, let's listen to what they say first. Father, we must succeed this time. You're good. With no one getting hurt, you're able to make Leung rebel against everyone easily. The older the ginger, the spicier. Compared to what we're about to do, this was nothing special. Soon, not only Leung Kwun, every martial artist will listen to us then. You should be giving out spells to those passing out food, Why're you back so soon? It's you? We meet again. This here must be Master So from the Beggar Clan, right? Long time no see, Wu the... Philanthropist? Please forgive me. Long time no see, we're supposed to share a drink and remember old times. However, you knew too much, so you won't live long. Leung. Their kung-fu is quite something, be careful. The king must be captured first. You handle Wu and I'll take care of them. Not bad! Why not join us and we'll rule together? How about turning him into ashes? You ask for it! Get the antidote, hurry! Is he all right? The needles have blocked the venom, but they won't last long. We have to get the antidote. Not again! Does your antidote work or not? After all, he's still acting crazy! This antidote is made according to what's written on the manual. At least he's conscious now, we have to be patient. It takes time for the antidote to work. Patience? He hits me every time I feed him, we gonna get killed before he's cured! Not much we can do, Master So! You must not stop the antidote, or our efforts would be wasted. Wasted? Fine, your turn. Hey, that's not right, Master So! Look at us, you can take his beatings better! And why does that means I should get beat up? Healers are like parents, you should try. You're perfect for him! You should do it! - No thanks! - Just go ahead! What are you two doing? What is this? Nothing... Sister. Can you do me a favor? Please feeding Leung the antidote. Why don't you do it? I was practicing kung-fu with Master So, and we hurt ourselves. Look at me, here... - It hurts! - Fine... You're both adults and still so careless! Leung. Take the medicine. Bai Xiao! Bai Xiao... Don't leave me! I'm not leaving. Take this medicine, Leung. Here. I think we better leave this task to Ngan Yuet from now on. No way, Master So! Not when they have to cuddle every time, what about my sister's image? No way! We have to think of something else! No, listen... When I was getting the medicine, I saw Wu's men putting up notices about rewarding handsomely for Leung's whereabouts. Why don't we do this? Master So, we... You're cunning! - We'll go with your plan! - Alright. We've been walking forever, are we there yet? Almost there. Will you renege on paying the reward stated on the notice? You deserve the reward, not a single silver coin less. Go! There he is. In the end, you still lose to me. Don't you worry, you'll be seeing your two friends soon. Young Master Wu, we've been waiting for you. Men! Hey... what are you doing? Don't worry, we won't hurt you. We just need to borrow you in exchange for the antidote. Don't come near, or I'll kill him! Stop, or he'll be dead! Stop hitting him! You poked me! Leung! He seems to be sensitive to music. Master So, keep playing and get his attention. I'll try to put needles on his pressure points. That's not music, let me! Master Leung, listen to me... I recognize you. Thank you for the antidote, I feel much better now. Much better? Sister, which tune were you playing? The Purity. Along with the manual, Master gave us a score and I learned from it. I understand now! The reason the antidote was working so slowly was because it needed the music of this Purity. There're worms that are sensitive to melodies? Yes, the Fantasia worm. That's right. Man Kwai Clan was using this worm, so the melody can control it as well as killing it. Looks like the days of Man Kwai Clan are numbered. Go check on him. Still thinking about Wu Ching-wan? Who would've thought that a famous philanthropist is actually the mastermind behind this? Using intrigue to gain fame and fortune, His selfishness led to recklessness for lives. So this is the martial arts world? Alright, Leung. Don't be sad. In our Miao tribe, there's nothing that can't be resolved with dance. Let me dance for you. Your tribe, do you always wear so many bracelets like this? You mean this? These are Arm Rings. Since there are many poisonous worms where we live, these rings can protect us. They're also our tribe's symbol of good luck. I have an idea! I'm sorry. I once promised that when we meet again, I'll make sure you'll never be bullied. But I broke my promise. I thought I can staying with you by leaving the martial arts world, then live a peaceful and uneventful life. But I was wrong. This martial arts world is everywhere there is mankind. It's not a world you can hide away from, I don't want this traged happen to someone else again. Think about it. Man Kwai Clan is now at his most powerful, snd he's surrounded by fighters that he control. If you go now, you may never come back. There are things that someone has to get it done. According to the Beggar Clan, the Man Kwai Clan will execute two plans. To the downtown, they'll use the spell to control those soldiers at the capital. And by attacking the commander of martial art of Canton and Guangxi, they can control all clans. Therefore, the altar of them are at their weakest point right now. Ngan Fung, Ngan Yuet. You two go inform the commander and the clans about this, tell them to be on alert and watch out for sneak attacks. Me and the Beggar Clan will hide in the capital, and attack Man Kwai Clan head-on. As for the altar... Leave that to me. Some things need to end where they began. "Man Kwai Clan" Leung Kwun. I haven't start looking for you yet, and you came right to me. Good. Today, I'll kill you as revenge for my son! Fellow masters. I know this is beyond your control, but Wu Ching-wan must die today. Try stop me if you can! "Unification of the Martial Art World" "Unification of the Martial Arts World" The martial arts world, it is nothing but a place full of hatred and resentment. How can someone really rule a world like this? Thanks to you, Man Kwai Clan is eliminated. All is calm and peaceful again now. This is only temporary. As long as there are people like Wu Ching-wan around, there will never be peace. Who would've thought you'd understand this better than me? Where will you be going next? I'll return to the countryside to stay with Bai Xiao and Bai Lin and live my days peacefully. But if troubles rear their heads again one day, what will you do? You know where I am, come look for me then. I'll go and fight till the last breath with you. Great, fight till the last breath! Let take our oath here with my wine gourd as the witness. Here. - We won't break our oath! - Good! I hope you won't regret this! If you lose to me, then your heroic image will suffer! Master So, you should worry about explaining to your clan if you lose! "The death won't disappoint time"
