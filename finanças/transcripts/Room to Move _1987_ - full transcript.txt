[ominous music] [music] [birds chirping] [peaceful music] [dog barking] [whistle blowing] [door slams] - You awake? - No. - Six o'clock. Come on, up. [waves crashing] - I will not stay thy questions or if thy follow me do not believe, but I shall do thee mischief in the wood. [laughing and wooing] - Next. - I, in the temple, in the town, the field. You do me mischief. Thy Dimettries. - Demetrius. - Demetrius. Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sins. [laughter and wooing] - Settle down. Yes? - Angie Spry. - Oh yes, we were expecting you this morning. Have you seen Mr. Wheeler? - Yeah. - All right. This is Angela Spry who's joining class. That's your desk there. [whispering] - Skinny. [laughing] - Stephanie, can you share with Angela for a moment? Continue. - We cannot fight for love as men may do. We should be wooed and we're not made to woo. - What's woo? - Sounds a bit [mumbling], doesn't it? [laughing] - Chris Pratt's gonna be in that cake commercial. - [mumbling] - Yeah, they're still looking for more kids. He reckons you have to turn up at Merlie's on Friday after school. - Right. - Yeah. - Oh, I've got training. - I wish they'd pick someone fat for a change. - Aww. [laughing] - Hey, there's that weird new kid. Someone cut her hair with a lawn mower. - You reckon you're punky, Miss Spry? - 17, down. 18, down. 19, down. 20, down. Okay, on your feet. Pull up, 50 meters jogging, 50 meters sprinting. Off you go, jog. Sprint! [birds chirping] - You waiting for the bus? - No. - I'm being picked up going down to the swimming pool if you need a lift. - I go down main parade. - Oh, I can drop you. It's not out of the way. - Oh, I just got a job there four nights a week at the hamburger joint. - At the Armpit? - Is that what it's called? - Ah, that's what it used to be called. I haven't been there for years. Probably make fantastic hamburgers for all I know. - Oh, they do use a lot of grease. I saw this guy poke his fork into a hot dog and it all spit out in his eye. - [laughing] Yuck. [horn honking] Well, here she is, sure you don't want a lift? - No, thanks. - See ya. - Bye. - Guess what, Carol? - What? - I got the magic mile video. - Even no tennis. - Dad? It's got the breaking on the four minute mile barrier. Bannister, Chataway, Elliot, Peterson the New Zealand guy right up the [mumbling]. - Oh, Andrea can watch her tennis. I've got to do this history. - Hi kid, how's things? - Frustrated by stupid nerves. - You need any help? - If I can't do it you wouldn't be able to. - Well, when you're finished come in. We'll run it. There's some very interesting tactical datas. - Are you in any of them? - There's no state championships. - When are we seeing you? - We'll have to borrow Grandads projector. - When though? - Shush. - I just wanna see dad. I don't wanna see all the other races, they're boring. - Shut up, I've got to do this history. - I'm bored though. - I'm gonna ring your neck in a minute. - I don't wanna watch boring athletics. I wanna watch tennis. - There's been a number of complaints about students loitering on the intersection of Franklin and Burke Streets and crossing when the lights are red. Now this is a dangerous and stupid practice and I don't expect to have to mention it again. [coughing] [laughter] Back on the farm, Stephanie. Tomorrow afternoon in the athletics I understand there'll be no under 16 1500 meters for girls, but we'll have at least one year 10 student running in the open event. [applause and cheering] And finally, I would like to remind everyone that artificial hair coloring is not permitted in this school. [chatter and laughter] [background chatter] - Good solid form on your head, Spry. - I grow any. - Aw, yuck. - Someone slagged Spry's hair. - Don't [mumbling]. - I think I dropped on in Spry's hair. [laughter] - Aarons is the person who's gonna make some effort now. Aarons is lying back in forth position and already has been dropped off by these first three. - Don't you even wanna watch the finish? It's one of the great climaxes. [announcer talking] - Look at him burst away at the straight. Big performance by Mike Hill to win the men's 1500 meters. - So tomorrow I wanna see you keep up with the leaders at all times. I don't wanna see you lumping along at your own pace and letting them get away from you. If you do it's always possible one of them will sprint away and get a winning break. - I have to finish that essay now. - At least you can have a bit of a lie in. Don't forget the morning run. - Gee, you're generous. Do you have to bring your camera tomorrow? - Why not? You gotta have a complete pictorial history of your career. - Well, it's embarrassing, dad. - In a couple of years time you'll love looking back on all your old races. - We're not going to sit through them, are we? I'll have to get married. [peaceful music] [clock ticking] - I won't have any voice left by the end of the race, so you better win. Night. [peaceful music] [cheering] - Remember, there's a time when I would start to hurt. That's the real test. People didn't fight it yet. The opposition hasn't been that strong but it'll come and that's when you've gotta decide how much winning means to you because if you can win you've got a big fat pain. When it comes down to it winnings what it's all about. The Olympics, people don't remember who came in second or third. You won the gold. That's all they remember. Now, you go out there and win. [banging] [cheering] - 319. [cheering] [peaceful music] [screaming and cheering] [background chatter] - Tricks time to the 1500 meters is four minutes, 27.3, a new school record. [cheering] [whistling] - Wanna come down to the arcade? All of us are meeting down at the arcade. - Oh, I've got swimming. - Don't bust a gut. - See ya. - You will star [mumbling]. - Bye. - Bye. [upbeat music] [upbeat music] - That was fantastic. I just heard the music so I came in. It was great. - How long were you watching? - Not long. I didn't mean to be spying or anything. - I didn't think anybody'd be around. - I'd love to be able to dance like that. - You should see the woman who takes our class. She's fantastic. - How long have you been doing it? - Four years. That's the trouble. You should start when you're about four. I just don't have good time. - Dancings great. - You could come along. You'd be good. Cause you'd be so fit from running and everything. You've got long legs. - How many nights a week? - Four. - Oh, I've got training, that's the trouble. You know, gym, swimming. One night off a week I get. - I saw your race. You're good. - Yeah well, I better go. Gotta swim laps. - I think your hair looks great. My folks would go out of their heads if I turned up with something like that. - Yeah, well they want me to get rid of it now anyway. They could just get nicked. When's your next dance class? - Tomorrow. - Do you reckon I could come and watch? - Course. - I suppose I could miss training one night. See ya. - You only won because the other less went out too hard. What you did was very risky. You'll never get right away. - She still won, dad. - Of course you did. But if the other girl had had any sort of kick she would never have caught her. You must have been 15 meters back coming up to the bell. By the way, I'm gonna be late to the pool tomorrow so Baralise will be picking you up. - I've got an essay to do though. - Well, do it when you get home. - No, I need all these books from the library so I'm gonna work there til six and then I'm going over to Stephanie's for a couple of hours. - What about the combined sports? It's not gonna be easy like today. Any session you miss could make a difference. You have to keep your rhythm. Keep to your system. - One night won't matter, dad. - What subject is it for? I'll have a word with them. - No, I don't want any special treatment. - A night off will do her good, darling. - You make excuses for yourself once and you'll do it again and you'll keep doing it. It becomes a habit. It's the attitude that's important. - Is that what you did? Started missing out on training sessions? - Never missed. I just wasn't good enough. And that's the difference. She's got the talent. She is good enough. When you've got the talent it's a crime to squander it. - Gee, you're talented. [upbeat music] - Okay girls, have a rest for a moment. [background chatter] - It's not all that romantic. - She works you incredibly hard. But it's great. [background chatter] [upbeat music] - See you at rehearsal on Tuesday? - Yeah. - Great. - Do you wanna get something to eat? - No, I should go home. - Okay. - Oh, all right, let's. - Great. - At the Armpit? - Yeah, we can have one of those sausages that squirts in your eye. [upbeat music] - Hey, [mumbling]. - I'm not working tonight, Ollie. - Oh, you should take over this place. I wouldn't know what people say to these lines. - Don't show me [mumbling]. - Mario, I have four with the lot, now I've six. It must be your cooking. - What time do you finish when you work here? - 12. - 12? Do your folks mind you getting home so late? - No, I just talk to the old man. He wouldn't know half the time anyway. - Oh, mine would freak. They have to know where I am every minute of the day. They think I'm at Stephanie Johair's place now. - So you're not? - Yeah, it's good. It gets really boring though. - When do you do your homework? - I don't except on weekends. - Oh, you can have a look at mine whenever you want for what it's worth. - Thanks. - Oh, I love chips. I'm gonna have to work them off. Gonna have to do 10 more push ups tomorrow to get rid of this extra fat. - Yeah. You wanna watch yourself. You'll start looking like Ollie. - Oh, get fast. [laughing] [tv announcer talking] - There you go, Angie. - Where's dad? - Gone mate, gone for some more ammunition. Off sides, off sides, of course he was. Good save. [door slams] [background yelling] - Shut up. - Great, Johnson. - What's wrong with her? - I don't know. [peaceful music] - High pressure system in the great Australian belt following a cold front moving through New South Wales. Who can give me the weekend forecast for Sydney? [laughter] The weekend forecast for Sydney, Angie? [laughing] [slams] Had a nice sleep? - Certainly is a nightmare waking up to you. [laughter] - Seeing you spend so much of your class time sleeping you'd better stay in after school. [birds chirping] - Carol. Carol? I'd like you to meet Sandy Wilcox. Sandy's from the Institute of Sports Cambrooke. - Hello. - Hi, it's not a good moment to be introduced, is it? That was terrific time? - Oh, down a bit on yesterday. - I hear you'll be running in the open 1500. - I hope so. - How do you think you'll go against the older girls? - Oh, don't know. Just hope I run a reasonable time. - Well, good luck. Nice to meet you. - Thanks. - The other girl I'd like you to meet is our high jumper. - Hi. - Hello. - How come you're here? - You saw me dance, I'm checking you out. - Oh, it's really interesting, isn't it? Just running around in circles. - Carol, do you think I could work at your place tonight? - Sure. So far I've got heaps to do. - Well, you can have a look at my history essay. It's just about done. - Thanks. - Carol? - You wait for me? [coach talking] [crickets and frogs chirping] - Coffee? - Yes, please. Tea thinks skinny. - I always have tea. Coffee's bad for you. It's because of the caffeine, keeps you awake. - My grandpa used to work in a land true company and he reckons he drinks about 12 cups of tea a day. Two when he gets up in the morning. Two at 11 o'clock, two after lunch, two for afternoon tea, two when he gets home from work, two before he goes to bed. He reckons he never has any trouble going to sleep. - She's the new girl, is she? - Yeah, just started a couple of weeks ago. - I'm surprised they let her hair go to school. - It's good though, isn't it? - She looks like one of those people in that current affairs program. - They were skin heads mom. - That's what she looks like to me. - Skin heads don't have any hair. - Why kids feel the need to change the natural color of their hair I'll never know. - What about Annie Jan? - Annie Jan is 45. - So? - When you're 45 you're old enough to know your own mind. - Finished, are ya? - Yeah, just about. - That's a good night's work. I'll give you a lift home, Angie. Where do you live? - Oh no, it's okay Mr. Trick. - Of course I will, it's 10:30. - Okay, thanks. - Goodnight, Angie. - Night, thanks for having me. - Got everything? - Yeah, all right. - Bye. [engine roars] [cans rattling] - He was wounded once. [background tv chatter] - But haven't you made any friends of your own since that time? - Well, this is something that we all have to come to terms with eventually. Sometimes very hard, but probably you'll find strength from other sources. Do you pray at all? - Oh yes. [upbeat music] - How's training? - Boring as usual. - Did you run time? - I'm getting worse. - Probably a lot of things, gorgeous, no onions. - Ah, seeing your girlfriend tomorrow? - That's right and a lucky girl she is too. Makes the best hamburgers in Sydney this girls does. - She's a good dancer too. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well then dance with me, darling. - Depends on whether you like charcoal or the burger. - I'll take the burger. I prefer food to dancing. My only fault. - Did you find out about that dance company? - Yeah, 50 bucks a student. - Oh, you're kidding. - No, I won't give for nothing you know? - Yeah. [upbeat music] - Go on. He's break dancing again. [cheering and applause] - What did you tell your dad? - I said I was working at your place. He's getting so freaked out about my missing gym. I kept telling him my marks are gonna be better this term. Little does he know. - They don't like me, do they, your parents? - Yes, they do. Why do you say that? - Don't know. - You heard from your mom? - No, not since she went off with that guy. Dad said he went right off the dollars today. Because [mumbling] to go for the past month. He said don't worry, I'll be keeping you company there at the end of the year. - Gee, some people like minding their own business. - What do we do if someone sees us? - We'll say we're dancers. We could pretend we don't speak English. - Then we'll be Russian. Lots of dancers are Russian. - Think they have classes in Russian? - Yeah, definitely. - That's it. - Look I know a little bit of French. - Yeah, well you look French with your hair like that. - You're right. - Yeah. [background chatter] [violin playing] - 15 minutes everyone. 15 minutes. - Stage can't be that far away Do you even know where we're going? - Well, sort of. - Hello. - Now what we have to do is find a way to get above the stage where the lights are. - Can I help you? - We're looking for Michelle Guest. - All right, you go back the way you came turn left at the end of the corridor, take the first turn on your right and it's on your immediate left. - Great, thanks. - Excuse me. - Quick, she's coming. Where's Michelle Guest. - I saw her name on one of the posts [mumbling]. [screaming] - We went in the wrong door. - Yes, right. - We're busted. - Ladies, it's just around the corner. I'll wait for you. It's a bit of a rabbit war in this place. You might get lost. - Oh that's all right, we'll find it. It's no problem. - Is Michelle expecting you? - Well, we're her sisters. - Oh really? [knocking] - Miss Guest your sisters are here to see you. - I beg your pardon. - Your sisters? - Hello girls, is mother here too? - I think they wanna see the show. - I see. [laughing] [intense music] - Spread out. It's the incredible shrinking woman. Ta-da! - She looks like she's taking out her armpits. [laughing] - No, it's a deodorant commercial. - No matter what the weather I never like to be left without my mum. - Hold on, do it again. Roll camera. - My boyfriend said I had an odor problem so I told him to rap off. [screaming] - Let's go! [screaming and laughing] - I'm wet. [laughing] - And what do you think you're doing? - Taking a shower. - Well, do your parents know where you are? - Yes, thank you. - Where do you live? - [mumbling]. - Have you been drinking? - Only water. - Look here, don't be jerky. - Oh, we won't be driving, sir. - And what's your name? - Angie Spry. - And yours? - Oh, we're sisters. [laughing] [knocking on door] - These two belong to you? - No. - Well, do you think it's a good idea letting two 15 year olds run around the park in the middle of the night? - They were supposed to be home at eight o'clock. As a matter of fact I was just thinking of going out and look for them. Anyway, you blokes picking 'em up will give them a good fright. - I see. All right, well I don't wanna see you two in trouble again. All right? All right? - Yeah. - Yes. - See ya. - Thanks Mr. Spry. - Well yous two better have [mumbling], huh? - Yep. - Why are you dressed up? - I went for a job interview. - Yeah? - Yeah, shouldn't have bothered. - Hi. - Do you know what time it is? - 11:00? - It's almost 12:00. - Well, sorry, we had stacks to do. - You didn't even leave us Angie's phone number, you know? - Oh, didn't I? [background tv chatter] - You should let us know if you're gonna be this late. Your mother was very worried. - I will next time dad. - You better give the morning run on this to give you a descent sleep. Your coach dropped around this evening too, by the way. - Yeah? - Yeah, we had a chat. She was wondering if there was anything on your mind, you know? Any sort of problems like school work. - Well, I suppose I've been dropping behind a bit. - You know what she thinks, don't you? - I know, should go to the Institute of Sport, right? - They're obviously interested. - They're going round all the schools, dad? - Is there anything the matter? - Ugh. - Training's a hard grind, I know. I know from my own experience. - I'm still doing everything just about. - You've missed several sessions. - It's just that I'm not sure that I want to sacrifice everything else. Like I don't have the time for anything else at all hardly. - Well, that's what we need to talk about. - I don't wanna talk about it dad. I'm not ready to talk about it. I just wanna think about it myself, okay? - Okay, sure. Just keep me posted, all right? - Now over the centuries have been eroded by action of the weather, by ice, snow, wind and rain. Carol? Now the nature of the ranges themselves reflects the age difference. The younger mountains are higher, more jagged and much more spectacular. Ah, Angela has decided to honor us with her presence. And to what do we owe this honor? - Sorry I'm late. - Well, do we get an explanation? Sleeping in again. I'd have thought you get enough sleep in class. [snoring sounds] [laughter] Well? - Well, I think she's gone Miss McCready. [laughing] - Thank you, Stephanie. Where are you going, Carol? - I'm going to see Angie. - There's no need for that. [door slams] Well. Would anyone else like to go? - Hi. - I can't come dad, I've gotta go and see Angie. - Why? - Because somethings wrong. - Well, see her after. - I'm going now. - Look, do you think I give up my afternoons for fun? - I've gotta go and see her, dad. Sorry. [horn honking] [dog barking] [knocking on door] [whistle blowing] - Um, is Angie home please? - No, she's not home from school yet. - Yes, I am. - Sorry. - Thanks. - They're creeps at that school. Every since I got there. - Yeah. I know. I looked for you after you walked out. Couldn't find you though. - Thanks. Mom came in last night. Dad come back early. There was this great fight for hours then dad went around, turned the music right up loud. Couldn't sleep or anything, so I went and hung at the park. - Well, you can sleep at my place if something happens like that again. - They wouldn't want me there. - Of course they would. Especially if I'm going to start doing dance classes with you. [thunder crashing] That's what I've decided to do. [singing] ♪ I never thought we would part ♪ As she sat upon my knee - 51 I'd give him. - [mumbling] I give it about minus 51. - I like to give them encouragement though. - And you tried. [laughing] - I'm taking up dance classes. - When? - Three nights a week. I'll have to give up swimming and a couple of training sessions. - You mean you'll have to give up running. - No, I won't. - You know what I mean. You wanna be good you have to be dedicated to the one thing, or I say you don't wanna be good. - I do wanna be good. I just don't wanna be good at one thing and dumb at everything else. - Don't be stupid. You do your classes. It doesn't interfere with anything. - Is this Angie's idea? - It's me, mom. I wanna dance, I've always wanted to. - More than you wanna run. - She's got the right body for a dancer. They're all skinny with long legs. - Look, I'm not pushing you. It's just very sudden, that's all. - I'm not giving up running. I'll still be doing it. - You used to love athletics. - I still do, sometimes. - Combined sports are in three weeks. That coach from the Institute will be there. You'll be the youngest girl in the 1500. You've come this far. Why don't you keep to your schedule til then? See how you go, make a decision after? - It won't make any difference, dad. I've already thought about it. - Well. I suppose I've just been wasting all my time too. - I'll still be a good runner. Maybe I just don't have to be the best. [clock ticking] - You awake, skinny? - No. - Don't worry, he's calming down now. I heard them arguing in the bedroom. - Thanks. - He'll get over it. I told him he was being childish. You're still gonna run, aren't you? I made this bet that you'll make the Olympics and if you don't I'll be ruined. You okay? - Yeah. - Don't let them get you down. Night. - Night. [chattering] - Good morning. - [together] Morning, Miss McCready. - What's this, a united front? - Yep. - Well, do I get an apology for the two of you walking out the other day? - Sorry, Miss McCready. - I hope your sporting successes aren't going to your head young lady. In this class you are no different to anyone else, you know? - No, Miss McCready. - Are you trying to annoy me by any chance, Carol Trick? - No. - I'll see you after school. - Yes, Miss McCready. [snickering] [peaceful music] [announcer talking] - Behind the line. [upbeat music] - On your mark. [gun shot] [cheering] [breathing slowly] [peaceful music] [cheering and applause] - Is she all right? - You all right, darling? - She's okay. - Yeah, I'm okay. - Gosh, she's good [mumbling]. [cheering and clapping] - Well, Lisa that was a very good run and in fact I think the institute might be more than interested in you. - Well, you know why you were beaten? - She woulda won anyway. - Maybe, but you would've finished closer. You had nothing left at the end. You were running on guts and I'm proud of you. You've been down for the last few weeks. - 80% isn't good enough. Not against top line competition. - Yeah, I know. Well, maybe I'll get back to 90%? But it was all getting too much. I wasn't having a good time with it anymore. - Yeah. Well. You need to make that decision. The institute is still interested in you. - I feel good about the past few weeks. I've been enjoying it when I've been running because I've been doing other things as well. And I feel fine about the race. I did as well as I could and it was good. - Yeah. See ya Monday after school. - Okay. Thanks, Jen. Carol in there? - Yeah. - You look half dead. - I was, I'm okay now though. - It's my fault wasn't it? Well, you would have won otherwise. Knocked off your training and everything. - You didn't. I kept down because I wanted to. It just took something to come along and shine me that's all. I was working too hard at it. It was just training, there was nothing else. Come on, don't look like that. You're the one friend I've got who can understand. - Yeah, I understand. Just about bit off half my thumbnail and you didn't even win. [clock ticking] - Brace yourself. - What do you think? - You look pretty. - I reckon you look skinny. - Thanks a lot, Parch. - I suppose you want a lift? - No, I can get the bus. - It's all right, it's on the way. Some people still go to the gym, you know? - I'll be working out just as hard as you. - Oh, yeah. - Bet I will. [laughing] [upbeat music] - Woo. [chattering]
