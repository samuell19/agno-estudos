Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Snacks. Stop that bloody song! Go away! You guys are torturing me. -I can't do this anymore. I told you I want the man responsible for our downfall dead. But you're hiding from him like a shameless man. -Hey! Right now, he's like a tiger looking for prey. We can't go anywhere near him. Are you saying we can't hurt him? -We can! I've hired a hit-man to kill him. Who is he? Bihar ka Badshah! Mafia King! Godfather of Gangsters! Bachchan Thakur! Bachchan Thakur! Welcome, Thakur! -Hmm. Thank god! Our enemy will be a dead man now! Come on! This man is nothing close to terrifying. Are you saying he'll kill him? These bullets in my gun don't show gender bias. The bullet will pierce your belly and come out from your brain. Shall I shoot? Thakur Saab, she was frustrated. Don't mind her. Make her understand. Shut up, will you? -Hmm. Hmm. What would you like to have? You can't get me what I want. Come to the point. Who's the target? He's someone who made this King of the Jungle a tamed kitten in circus. Someone who dethroned my MLA position. Someone who killed her brother Basi Reddy... Shut up! What's wrong with you, man? I can't understand shit if you narrate in bit and pieces. Listen, Narsi... If you want me to kill him, show me a detailed history of how he screwed you over. Any problem in doing that? No, Thakur Saab. I'll show you the entire storyboard. Go ahead. -All eyes this way. What's going on? -That's how filmy he is. Whatever. Wow! Fantastic! Title looks amazeballs. This story kicked my ass, Thakur Saab. Is it? -Yeah. How come? -Look. Show me. 'Only 2 gangsters ruled Devaralanka up until a year ago.' 'Me and Siddhappa.' '25 years ago, we both grew as gangsters in Mumbai.' 'We committed multiple crimes.' 'We moved here with the help of Devaralanka MLA Siva Reddy.' 'While doing illegal businesses and settlements with him,' 'we killed anyone and everyone who came in our way.' 'But, MLA Siva Reddy's death ignited competition between us.' 'In other words, political power.' 'Soon, that hunger for power turned us into enemies.' 'That's when a new gang came into the picture.' Guys, strike! We missed it. Athreya, you're so dead if it escapes. -No way, bro. Run, guys! Faster! Run, guys! -It's faster than a horse. It's a cross-breed. Of course, it's fast. Nab it! Damn! It got away! Don't be pissed, bro. -Then do something. Catch it! Idiot! You're good for nothing. Gotcha! Bro, time for a selfie. -Crazy! Hunting completed! -Click. "I've cooked wild steak for you, Lakshmi" "Taste it and let me know what you think" "My darling Lakshmi..." "Wild steak on the menu tonight" Dad, nobody cooks steak better than you in Devaralanka. I know that! Nagaraju is amazing! My mouth's watering already. Let's dig in. -Sure. Let's go. Mahalakshmi, my son worked hard and brought wild steak for me. I made a special curry. Tell me how it tastes. Dad, hurry up! -Coming. Coming. Mr. Nagaraju... Mr. Nagaraju... Sounds like Crossing Apparao. Why is this jealous man here? Mr. Nagaraju... Come on out! What's up, Crossing Apparao? What brings you here on a business day? To hell with my business. Your son and his friends have stolen my cattle. Stole it? -I swear, sir. Hey! Come here, you! -I'm dead. Is he telling the truth? He's lying, dad. What's the proof? What's the proof? You want proof, huh? It's right here in his hand and on my phone. I guess this picture clears your doubts. [singing randomly] Bro, is the steak ready? He's the one who posted it with #gangarajuandgang #huntingsuccess. #feelingthrilled apparently. These guys have ruined my business. How can I breed new cattle if they steal all of it? What are you there for? -Shut your mouth! See, Mr. Nagarjuna. They're mocking me while they're eating my meat. How did you give birth to such a rogue? How dare you call my son a rogue, bloody! I'll kill you like he killed that goat. Get out of here! This is unfair, sir. He killed the goat This one posted it online. You cooked it with extra spices. I seek justice and you threaten to kill me? Forget it, dad. We don't want him crying on our porch. Give him some money. You come on in! I don't need your bloody advice. Sir... -You're still here?! Collect your money in the evening. Will you really pay me? -Do I have a choice? I promise. Now leave! Taste the curry. -I'll empty it, bro. Delicious! This piece is just out of the world. I didn't know you could cherish a stolen meal so well. For a second, I really believed that you worked hard to make me happy. I'm retiring as gangman in 10 days. When will you get your life on track? Bloody! You've totally gone after your devious uncle Buchi Raju. Dad, I won't tolerate it if you insult mother's side of the family. Yeah, right. You seem to be obsessed with them. Listen... -What? It's a crime to talk with such beautiful steak in front of you. Come on. Dig in. As if he's going to leave anything for me. I've saved a few pieces for you, uncle. All I see is the gravy. Oh, lord! Father! Basheer Bhai... Biryani is scrumptious. And the ladies who made it... They seem more scrumptious. I asked you to give away your land in Town Bazar. But apparently, you don't fear Basi Reddy or his brother-in-law. So I came to introduce you to fear... and Basi Reddy himself. Basi Reddy! There's always a line that you shouldn't cross. You've crossed it long back. I swear by Allah... No God will forgive you! You'll die a pitiful death! Father! Father! Father! Guys, put them in my jeep. -Okay, bro. Feed them to our wild dogs. -Done, bro. Father! Father! Siddhappa and Narsa Reddy compete for the MLA position in Devaralanka. Tea. Uncle, who do you think will win? Siddhappa or Narsa Reddy? It's like choosing between a knife and poison. Devaralanka is better off without them. -You're right. I wonder when we'll be rid of them. What say, Ganga Raju? Everything has a flow, uncle. It's not in our hands. True that. Did your flow get you here, bro? She's a spitting image of Payal Rajput. I know, right. -Yeah. Let's go. Bro! What's wrong? -You can't go dressed like this. She'll run in the opposite direction. You've got a point. Let's go! Is she still that notorious? -Now more than ever. Sister, I see you got guests. -My sister from Bhuvanagiri has visited. Oh, that makes her my sister too. What's your name, sister? I'm Roja. And this is my daughter. Beautiful. -What? Your name's beautiful. -Oh! Sister, Gangaraju lives in the opposite house. He's a really good guy, auntie. -She's right. My sweetie! So he'll help us out if needed. -Sure. Looks like he'll come running anyways. -Hold on, dear. She didn't mean it. Don't feel bad, brother. She takes time to connect with new people. So she'll connect with time. -What? Uh-huh. Nothing, sister. Just a sigh and we'll be here whenever you need us. Dear, our luggage... -Oh, the bags! Guys, take them inside. What are you looking at? -You're fooling us to maintain flow. This is just a sample. We have a long way to go. Any problem, dear? -Nothing, sister. Bro! -Lazy bums! They can't get a grip of themselves. Guys, hurry! Be careful. Sister, all I see is bags. Where's the rest of the stuff? Is there another truck? -No. We need to buy everything again. Mom! -That's strange. But, whatever. There's a friend's store. What all do you need? Does he offer discount? -How much do you want? At least 50%... -50%...?! Nobody in this town does that. -Shut up! Family is an exception. You'll get a discount. Write down a list. The list is ready. They came prepared. -Yeah? Give it to him. Thanks. -All the best! Let's go, sister. He'll handle it. -Bye. Bro, open it! -Oh! It's like a freaking water stream. This is something to click a selfie about. KD Brothers Home. Is the information correct? -Of course, bro. New house and new stuff. The whole family went on vacation, except for their blind grandma. The house is near the outskirts. Even if she yells, nobody will notice. Hmm. Let's go in. Grandma inside. Beware! That's a weird board. KD Brothers are weird. This was supposed to be a board for dogs. Bro, I can handle the grandma. You chill. No, man. -Bro, hold this. Sit outside and listen to romantic music. When you tell your love story to your kids, our characters should stand out. You think so? -We know so. Alright, guys. Make it quick. Come on, guys. Athreya is going to shock the grandma today. Don't use much. We'll be in trouble if she dies. Where's the grandma? I don't see her anywhere. Power cut?! Seriously?! You think this is some store that you can come and take whatever you want? This is Tigress Bhanumathi's den! Oh, yeah? Let's see. How did you figure out that we're here to rob the place? People who can see only recognize what's in front. But a blind person is highly aware of all his senses. 5 men got down from an empty truck. 4 of you came inside. One of them is outside listening to the 'Chitti' song. Hey, old woman! If you cooperate with us, we'll finish our job and leave. Otherwise... -Huh? Otherwise what? We'll kill you and take everything from here. Oh, really? Why don't you try? We'll see if you take the stuff out or if people come and take your dead bodies. You'll see Athreya's potential. Did she just hit me? Hey, 420! Drop these silly ideas and try something for real. Idea! Let's play the cat game with her. Start! Bro! Bro, help! Is she crazy? Why is she spilling the chips on the floor? Guys, she's not crazy. In fact, she's making us looking mad. She pulled out a gun. Run! Grandma, are you really going to kill us? Is Athreya killing the grandma? You guys are so dead! You shouldn't have messed with me. She might kill them! Grandma! Please let us go! That just missed me. Thanks, bro. You came in the right time. Otherwise, she would've killed us by now. Do they have all the items on the list? -Except for the grinder, yes. I have one at home. You guys pack everything here. Bro, she's like a sleeping tigress. Let's take a selfie with her. Go ahead. -Wow! Selfie with grandma! Roja sister! Mom is in the washroom. She's in this room? I'm coming. Roja sister! -Hey! Sorry. -What? Don't you have manners? It's not about manners. You didn't say it clearly. I had a pin in my mouth. Mom is in the washroom. Hmm. Now I understand. -Good. Now please go out. Go! -But... I said go! What does he think? [lizard] What? -Fall on her. [lizard] No, I won't. -Please. Just for once. [lizard] How many movies are you going to use me in? I'll get bugs for you. Please fall once. [lizard] Alright, done. -Hey! What are you still doing here? I mean... What? -Ah, lizard! I heard screams! It's nothing, mom. I just saw a lizard. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sister... -Why do you look high? Nothing like that, sister. By the way, what are you doing here? -Yeah, what am I doing here? Umm... I brought your stuff. Really?! Let's go look. Come on! Come look, auntie. We brought a sofa set, TV, fridge and so many other things. Oh, my god! Gangaraju, I'm really impressed. Next, I want you to take care of clothes and jewellery for my daughter's wedding. Do we steal those too? -Shut up! Okay, sister. -Mom... Why aren't any of the items packed? We couldn't steal the packaging, sister. -Idiot! He said we could either get packaging or the discount. So we ditched the covers and got the discount. Absolutely right! Gangaraju, tell them to arrange everything. Got it. Let's go, guys. Be careful. You move out of the way. Stand with me. -But there are no covers. Take them in. Sister, the 9 days of Ganesh festival begins today. You should totally bring her and pray for her. Pray for her? Yeah, for her marriage. He's the most powerful God. Ganesh Maharaj ki... -Jai! [indistinct chatter] It's beautiful, mom. -I know, right. Gangaraju got everything done. -Really?! Is that her? You got great taste, bro. She's cute. Welcome, sister. Let me hold it for you. Uncle, this is my sister Roja. Namaste. -Namaste. This is my daughter. -Namaste, uncle. Your son is an extraordinary man. -Why? He filled our house with stuff as soon as we asked for it. Really?! -Dad, shall we start the puja? Yeah. Come on, guys. Dad, it's good luck to make the new girl do the puja. Good luck for who? -Everybody, dad. Oh. Please go, dear. -Come! Please come. -Go, dear. Priest, the new girl is here. Let me help. Pray sincerely. Everything will be fine. Ganesh Maharaj ki... -[all] Jai! Ganesh Maharaj ki... -[all] Jai! [romantic song] We caught the fish, bro! You ruined a sweet dream for some fish! I want Uma Devi to like me. All I need is one opportunity. I found it! What is it? -Look! Hey, stop! If you go thrash those idiots now, Bujji will go and speaks highly of you. Uma Devi will come running for you. Let's go! -Come on. Grab the auto from the rod. This will do? -It's more than enough. I didn't even touch him yet. You rascals! How dare you eve tease! I'll rip your skin off! She's a cop?! -What's happening, dude? We're flabbergasted! We're out of here! If you ever tease girls again, I'm going to break your balls. Get the hell out of here! Thanks, sister. Come, I'll drop you home. Just a minute, sister. I'll be right back. Gangaraju, did Uma Devi's ferocious side shock you? So, are you going to back off? -Yeah. Bujji, you're speaking to Gangaraju. I've just decided strongly. If the wife's a cop, husband has full security. Whoa! No way I'm letting her go. All the best! [romantic song] Uma Devi's calling. -Really? Answer. Hello... -Gangaraju... Tell me, darling. -We need to talk in private. Come see me? She wants to talk privately. -Wow! Is it? Where should I come, darling? -Police station. Police station. Got it. I'm coming! She's mine! -All the best! Guys, if she wants to talk in private, she should've called him to a park. Police station is kind of fishy. [singing randomly] Uma Devi! -Don't worry. I'll handle it. I'm here for you. Your job will be done. Darling! -Trust me. I'm here! -Beautiful. Welcome. You said you want to talk in private. Tell me. Tell me. -Hmm. I'm getting there. First look here. -Namaste. KD Brothers! -Hmm. I'll be back. -Where do you think you're going? Get in! She locked me up! I thought you were impressed but I guess not. Uma Devi! -Your stuff has arrived. Wow! Thank you, ma'am. Why did you have all the stuff moved? Did you get transferred already? No, mom. All that stuff belongs to them. [all] Hmm! But Gangaraju worked so hard for it. Haha! Worked hard? He stole all that stuff. -What?! Yes, ma'am. We're the owners of all that used stuff. Gangaraju! I'm screwed. I have to manage somehow. -Gangaraju! Are you a thief? -Sister! I can't believe you're also calling me a thief. Bad times. You have to know the truth. -What is it? Isn't Krishna your favorite ? -I mean... I know it's Krishna. Yeah. So what? Why did he steal? -For the welfare of the world. I did it for your daughter's wedding. Gangaraju! Yes, sister. If kind mothers like yourself have such daughters, I know how tough it is to afford a wedding. -Very tough. So... I did whatever I could. Doesn't mean you call me a thief. No. You're not a thief. -I'm not! You did a great thing. -Then please get me out. You're such a kind soul, sister. -Mom! Ma'am! Ma'am! -Calm down! Whoa! What are you doing, mom? I'm correcting your mistake. What are you guys still doing here? Take your stuff and leave. Get going! But, mom... -Thank you, ma'am. See you all. Oi, KD! Put the grinder back in my auto. -Why? It's my dad's. -Oh! Great! I'll see you. Gangaraju! I had to do it, sister! Look. He stole from his own house for your wedding. How could you arrest such a great man! Karma will get back to you. Gangaraju, you come with me. See you. Gangaraju! Hey! I'll kill you if you scream. Feed her well. She's really weak. Mother! I feel like dying, mother. Basi Reddy... It's time to burn down the castle of Siddhappa. He's attending a yaga tomorrow. Make sure that he doesn't get back home. I'm sure you will. Whether or not I become the MLA is in your hands. See you. My brother will handle it. You're the next MLA. MLA Narsa Reddy... -Hail! Dad... You got off duty, right? Why didn't you come home yet? I can't even eat anything without you. Let's go home. I don't feel like coming home, son. I'll be retiring tonight. I've gotten used to these tracks since 35 years. I can't get myself to leave the platform. From tomorrow onwards, this uniform won't exist in my life. Neither will these tracks. So, I wanted to spend my last day of work here. Got it. You stay here. I'll be right back. Hey! Gangaraju! Dad, I brought food. We have everything right here. We can sit for as long as you'd like. Alright? Okay. But how could you steal from your own house to impress a girl? Who would marry you if they found out about this? I don't care. All I need is you. Moreover, what we become is in our destiny. Who knows how our flow is? Let's see. But first, let's eat. Listen. Be more responsible, please. -Yeah. Yeah. I will. First eat. I wonder when you ate last. Congratulations, Nagaraju! Congratulations, Nagaraju! No work is small or big. Ever since Nagaraju joined as a gangman in the railways, He has been a sincere employee who always delivered. Though we're sad that he's retiring today, we're glad that we got to honor him. I request Nagaraju to speak a few words. Railways have given me a living to survive. Now, as this journey comes to an end... it has given me something to live by. Look how happy your dad is. That's how you live life. Please try to understand and settle down in life. Dude, if I impress Uma Devi, that's considered settling down, right? Say something! Uncle, we've planned a procession for dad from the market to our house. We'll take care of those arrangements. Bring dad there on time. Go ahead! Bhadrappa... I'm attending the yaga. Narsa Reddy should be dead when I return. Siddhappa should be the MLA of Devaralanka. Do you get it? What's wrong? -Some procession. Honk at them. Where's Gangaraju? -He went to get the garland. Sister, give me one garland. Move out of the way! I'll kill you all! What are you guys doing? Is this the place for a procession? You don't deserve that shawl. Dad! Drive. Dad! Gangaraju, Siddhappa hit your dad and took his shawl. Look at what he's done. Gangaraju! Gangaraju, stop! Hey! Move your auto. Siddhappa... You think I'd keep quiet if you hit my dad? You made a mistake! Fall on his feet and apologize in public. I'll spare you. You want me to apologize? If you're man enough, come get the shawl. Why did you stop? -You seemed to be lost in thought. I was imagining how Gangaraju beat Siddhappa for humiliating his dad. The fight was amazing! Yes, it was amazing. But... -But what? Want to get shot? Come on, continue. What is this, son? You're not some gangster to go around killing people. Dad... -Don't say a word. I'm really proud to have a son without any future or responsibility. Really proud! Sorry, uncle. Your son is under arrest for killing Siddhappa. Move it! Uma! Uma, listen to me! Mr. Srinivas... -Yes, ma'am. File a charge sheet on Gangaraju. -Okay, ma'am. Uncle... Seems like your ma'am really misses me. She's arresting me at every opportunity she gets. Shut up! You do your job. -Hold on, ma'am! Mom, why are you here? -To free Gangaraju. It's not some petty robbery case, mom. It's a murder. You call it murder. But the public believes that he has assassinated evil. What?! -Let me show you. SI... -Down! Down! Gangaraju should be... -Freed! SI, Siddhappa wasn't a great man. In fact, he was a monster. Gangaraju did this town a favor by killing him. [public hailing Gangaraju] We won't leave unless you bail Gangaraju out. [public hailing Gangaraju] -Uncle... Just because the public is supporting him, he's not in the right. Siddhappa's son Bhadrappa is coming to file a case on Gangaraju. SI... Gangaraju didn't kill my father. He died in an accident on the way to a yaga. Let him go. You heard him. There's no case here. Let him go. Mr. Srinivas... -Yes, ma'am. Gangaraju, I didn't save you so that you could live. I saved you to kill you with my own hands! The same public will perform your last rites within a year. [public hailing Gangaraju] As someone who inspired them to lift their heads up, you shouldn't hang yours down. You killed that gangster and gave them courage. You've brought light to their lives. From today, you're not just gangman Nagaraju's son. You're our Gangster Gangaraju! [public hailing Gangaraju] Now roll your moustache. Come on! [public hailing Gangaraju] [upbeat song] You did a great thing by killing Siddhappa. You're the reason we're living in peace. God bless you! You wanted him to do good, right? Now he's doing good for the whole town. What more could you ask for as a father? [upbeat song continues] You should've kept the cast a little longer. Don't lift any weights with this hand for 2 weeks. See you, sir. What are you looking at, Father? Wondering when I'll kill your killer? Bro, just say yes and I'll place Gangaraju's head at boss's feet. What? Have you suddenly become a man now? He has to die in my hands only! Until my knife tastes hi blood, he shouldn't even get a scratch. Do you get it? Mom, I can't marry him just because he's a good man. Gangaraju is a gangster and I'm a cop. This combination won't work. Then quit your job. What?! You'll regret not marrying him. Think about it. Mom, I'd rather stay single than quit my job. I'm late for work. Bye. Welcome, MLA Nakka Narsa Reddy! Mr. Srinivas... -Yes, ma'am. What's your opinion about Narsa Reddy? He's a monster, ma'am. His brother-in-law Basi Reddy is worse. I wish Gangaraju got rid of them too. Good-riddance! Mind your words. -Okay, ma'am. Come, dear. Watch your step. -Dad! Mr. Srinivas... -Yes, ma'am. Get a stretcher. -Okay, ma'am. Uncle, what happened? She's having labor pains. Stop right there! You can't take her in until and unless the MLA inaugurates the ward. Doctor, she's in a critical condition. Sorry, ma'am. We can't risk it. I can. Uncle, I got this. Guys, grab the stretcher. Pooja, you'll be fine. Your brother's here for you. Come on, guys! Gangaraju, you're making a mistake! -Hey, move! Thanks, Gangaraju. If you don't mind... -I know what you're going to ask. The guy she loved betrayed her. He got her pregnant before marriage and left her. Congrats! It's a baby girl. Mother and the baby are safe. -Thanks, doctor. Alright, uncle. Three of you should visit us once she's discharged. We'll discuss the rest there. [public hailing MLA Narsa Reddy] Stop! What's wrong? -Umm... Everything! Gangaraju opened the ward before you got here. He made us look like fools in front of the Media and public. Gangaraju! Here you go, brother. Name the baby girl and make your mark, brother. Why do you look shocked? A man like you shouldn't stop at the MLA seat. You belong on the top. That is why I had to do this. Name her, brother. -Umm... Ra... -Ah! Not that name! Did you just mock me? No. I just don't like that name. I don't know any other names. Public will take your case if you give her that name. Think of a better name. Better name? Gangaraju, I've got an idea. Hold her. Why don't you name her? I'll take the credit. Uncle... -Yes? Doesn't she look just like my mom? -Yes. I'll name her after my mom. Mahalakshmi. [public hailing Gangaraju] Why are they calling you gangster? Hail the MLA, guys! -[public hailing the MLA] 'What's your name, sister?' -'Roja.' 'This is my daughter.' -'Nice.' 'Isn't Krishna your favorite lord?' -'Yeah. So what?' 'Why did he steal?' -'For the welfare of the world.' 'I did it for your daughter's wedding.' Hey, didn't you freshen up yet? Forget about me. Where are you going all dressed up? I'm going to Gangaraju's for dinner. -Oh! What's special? Brain curry, mutton fry, fish broth, prawns curry... And many more items! -Mom! I meant what's the occasion. -Oh, is it? It's his mother's birthday today. Nagaraju brother invited us personally. You won't come anyways. Have pickle rice and go to sleep. I'll go enjoy the meal. Mom, you're going to have a feast. Why should I eat pickle rice? I'll pack some for you. No need. They'll feel bad if I don't turn up. I'll freshen up and come. We'll go together. So you're coming, too? Isn't that what I just said? -Oh! Let's eat. Please sit down. Come on. What is this, dad? We finally have guests over and you burned all the food. Idiot! Take those goggles off. You'll see how the food really looks like. Brother, didn't you invite anyone else for dinner? No. If your daughter agrees to marry my son, we'll make that a grand celebration. Sister, you shared everything with me. Why didn't you tell me she's a cop? She didn't let me. Do you know how she became a cop? -I'm all ears. Mom, no! -It's okay. A gang of boys teased her in 10th grade. She decided to beat them up. She became a cop in order to do that. Did you beat them up later on? Oh, no! They moved overseas by the time she became a cop. Since then, if she sees somebody eve teasing, she goes all violent on them. That's how women of today should be. This is the saree his mom bought for her future daughter-in-law. Take it, dear. Mom... -Take it. Thanks, uncle. We'll get going. -Okay, dear. Ganga, drop her at her place. Dad, don't you think it's a bit much? She stays in the opposite house. It's okay, son. You guys can talk on the way. In that case, okay. Is Uma Devi okay with it? -Uma's ready! Give me that and go! I didn't expect you to come. Thanks a lot. It's cool. Tell me. Do you love your mom so much? Yes, ma'am. I'm equally angry with her as well. Angry? Why? Apparently, when I was a kid, I wouldn't leave my mom's side. But she left me alone. So I'm pissed. Enough about my mom. What about you? -What about me? You took my mom's saree. Does that mean you like me? Why is she walking back? Was that too early? Hello... Hello, madam! Sister told me all about it. If me being a gangster is the problem, just say the word. I became a gangster for the public. I can leave everything behind for Uma Devi. You won't find another like me. Think about it. In that case, I'll think about it and let you know tomorrow. Meet me at the church at 9 AM. I'll go wait there. -Gangaraju! Cut the drama. Just be there by 9 AM. My stole... -Yeah, I was returning it. It's okay. Keep it. Don't squeeze it too much, okay? Bye. I'll be waiting for you. She's mine! Mom, how does this saree look on me? It's beautiful. You're shining. Gangaraju must be waiting for me. I'll see you. -Go. Go. Please, mom. At least tell dad about it. What’s the point? You think he’ll come running? Work comes first for him. Has he ever cared about us? Moreover, I told you girls shouldn’t get into sports. Look what happened. What’s wrong, auntie? Nothing. Just a small hiccup at school. -Sister! What is it, Bujji? -Tell her I can't drop out of school. Auntie, if it's a small issue, why are you making her drop out? Bujji, what happened? Sir... What's up, Principal? -We've got a small problem, sir. What is it? -Watch this video and you'll know. Look, Teacher... If every woman that I sleep with has a kid, this school will be filled with my kids. So, quit all this marriage crap and get a transfer. And then, get an abortion. I never want to see your face again. Otherwise, I swear I'll kill you! Do you understand? Girls, good news. Both the teams made it to the District Football Championship. Who shot this? Who shot it? Shruti, you're the captain of your team. All the best! -Thank you, sir. PT, you don't have to say all the best to someone who won't play. What?! -Replace her with someone else. Sir, please. Why are you kicking me off the team? Because you shot that video and took it to the Principal. Sir, I've worked really hard for this match. Please don't kick me off the team. This is my dream. Dream, huh! I have a dream too. Meet me at the depot in the evening. We shall discuss our dreams, okay? Auntie, this isn't a small issue like you think. It's about Bujji's future. We can't spare monsters like him, who toy with girls' lives. I won't spare him! Brother, the new SI, along with that school kid, are filing a case on you. Sign here. Mr. Srinivas, are you done? -Yes, ma'am. This is enough to arrest him, Bujji. He can't get away this time. Are you seriously filing a case on Basi Reddy? Don't you want to live? In Devaralanka, no cop or man has come in my way until now. This town and your police station are under my control. Want to see? What's her name? -Uma Devi, sir. Uma Devi! SP! -Yes, Mr. Basi Reddy. Your new SI has filed a case on me. What should I do? Put her on the line. I'll talk to her. Sir! Who the hell do you think you're messing with? But sir, what he has done... If you don't want to get fired, apologize to him and send him home. But sir... -Do as you're told. Come on. Apologize to me. Hey! I didn't put on this inform to apologize to brutes like you. Is your arrogance coming from the uniform? Want me to calm you down? -Hey! To hell with you! If you ever mess with me again, I'll strip you naked in front of the whole town. Hey, Basi Reddy! I could encounter you right here, right now. But your death should be celebrated like a carnival. Do you know who you messed with? Gangster Gangaraju's fiance. He killed Siddhappa for laying a hand on his father. Will he keep calm if you touch his girl? He won't spare you! You said you'd strip me naked in front of the whole town. He'll definitely kill you in front of the same crowd. What is she talking about? Basi Reddy, Gangaraju, death, carnival... Whoa, whoa, whoa! This story sounds really interesting. -Yeah, brother. Alright, let's go with it. The whole town shall watch who'll die in whose hands. I'm in! Call your man. Gangster Gangaraju! I'll see you, Uma Devi. I see it. I see this is where your downfall began. Gangaraju killed Basi Reddy for humiliating his girl. Am I right? Shoot me! Just shoot me! -Hey! What's wrong? What I'm narrating and what you're seeing is different. Gangaraju didn't kill Siddhappa. Who was it then? Basi Reddy! Bro... Bro... So while Basi Reddy was killing Siddhappa, Gangaraju witnessed the whole thing. Yes, Thakur Saab. People assumed it was Gangaraju and made him a gangster. Uma Devi believed he's a really a gangster and challenged Basi Reddy. Yes, Thakur Saab. This is so trippy. I feel sorry for Gangaraju. Uma Devi... Hello. I love you. Dude, you're amazing. This is so sexy. What the hell! -Please be calm. What's up, Narsi! Are you feeling bad? -No, Thakur Saab. Well, what are you waiting for? Let the movie begin! Why did you stop? Keep pressing. You narrate. It's 09:30. Where is she? Hi, uncle. Congrats, man! Your love is victorious! What are you saying? -Uma Devi ma'am loves you. How do you know? -Idiot! She made the whole town know. Really? Hold on a minute. I always knew Uma Devi loves me. "Yay! Uma Devi is mine!" By the way, what did she do? Hey, Basi Reddy! Do you know who you messed with? Gangster Gangaraju's fiance. I could encounter you right here, right now. But your death should be celebrated like a carnival. You said you'd strip me naked in front of the whole town. He'll definitely kill you in front of the same crowd. Gangaraju! Are you there? -Beh! Beh! Like ma'am said, Basi Reddy's death should be celebrated like a carnival. Celebrated? -Yes! Like a carnival? -Yeah, I know you'll do it. Yeah, sure. Where is she right now? She's headed to meet you. Thanks for the information. -All the best! Yeah, something like that. Bye. -See you. What have you done, Uma Devi! This girl is crazy. I thought she'll come and say she loves me. But she challenged Basi Reddy. Instead of dying in the hands of that monster, I'd rather tell her the truth that I'm not a gangster. Yeah, that's better. Gangaraju! I love you! Gangaraju, I wanted to tell you this first. But Basi Reddy made me so furious that I said it in front of everyone. It's okay. Srinivas uncle told me everything. It was a hasty decision. Let's think about our future first? Hmm. I've thought about it. You said you'd do anything for me. Make Basi Reddy know that my fiance is the real deal! Will you do it? I'll do it. Do I have a choice? I have to do it! Oh, god! Thank you, Gangaraju! Let's start! [Gangaraju's hype song] Look! Gangster Gangaraju has arrived! Is he being serious? [Gangaraju's hype song] Hey, Athreya! What's happening here? -We're elevating your chivalry. Yeah! We're singing about how you're going to kill Basi Reddy. Super, Athreya! -Thank you, sister. No, it's not super. You can sing when I've killed him. To hell with your singing! What's that sound? -Look over there. Sharpen it well. It should slit right through. Heads shall be chopped one by one. Why are you sharpening it, dad? Are you going out for a hunt? I'm sharpening it to chop Basi Reddy's head. Hey, give me your hand. Is it sharp enough? -More than enough! You deserved that. Mark of victory! -Put the garland on him. Yay! That's great! That rogue has laid his hand on my daughter-in-law. Let's chop him off into pieces. -Yes! Come on, people! Dad! Dad! Calm down and hear me out. What is it? -We need a solid plan to kill him. A solid plan? -Yeah. He's now powerful than before. He's MLA Narsa Reddy's brother-in-law. So what? We shouldn't attack a powerful man with fury. We should hit him with intellect. So, aren't you going to kill him, Gangaraju? You short man! You were the one who gathered them, right? I just said I'll come up with a solid plan to kill him. Get back to work. But we've postponed everything to watch you kill Basi Reddy. Make the plan really solid. -Yeah, whatever. Go. Let's get going, guys. Ganga! You can go over budget. But make sure the plan is solid. No backing down! Bro, I uploaded a post about your solid plan. It is flooding with likes and comments. What did you post, Konda? #gangstergangarajuandgang -Wow! #basireddymurderplan -Double wow! #feelingexcited -Triplewow! Bro, expectations are just soaring. You shouldn't keep your fans waiting. Please tell us what your sketch is. You guys are really thrilled. -Hmm. Let me show you a short film. Let's not watch these short films, bro. Let's show Basi Reddy a terrific horror film. Konda, come here. Athreya, can't you shut your mouth for once in your life? You know it, bro. This is a film all of you guys should watch. Then show it, bro. Watch today! Gangster Gangaraju presents... Terrific, don't you think? Absolutely terrific! I feel so sober suddenly. By the way, where's our clown? -Yeah, where did he go? Brother! What are you doing over there? I'm going to die, brother. This will be my last selfie. You post it. I'm going to die for real. Stop right there! Hey, you! What's wrong, man? I thought you were really a gangster and... -And? messed really badly with Basi Reddy's gang. What did you do, man? Now you look at my short film. Bro, one tea. We should tell Basi Reddy brother about this idiot. Yeah, man. He's driving me nuts. Have you gone blind? What the hell is this? Oh! I'm sorry. To hell with your sorry. -Take your hand off. Who do you think I am? I'm Gangster Gangaraju's friend Athreya. You saw how he killed Siddhappa. Are you running away? -Be thankful that brother called us back. What would you do otherwise, huh? You've messed with Basi Reddy's men. You're so dead! Basi Reddy is also going to be dead soon. Go away! Or I'll rip your skin off. Just die, man. -Bro! I said die! -But bro... We've grown up together. Have you ever seen me hit someone? No, bro. How could you guys believe that I killed Siddhappa? You were in a rage that day. So we thought you must've killed him. I wouldn't kill someone in a rage. You've been showing me off ever since, bloody! You called me People's Savior, Strength and what not. For God's sake, please stop hyping me so much. Sorry, bro. To hell with your sorry! My life's already screwed. Basi Reddy is giving us the chills. -Yeah, please do something about it. We can't hurt Basi Reddy in any way. But we can kill the angst in Uma Devi that wants to kill Basi Reddy. But how? Till now, the story was leading us. Now we're going to lead the story. Sure, bro! -Idiots! Let's go. What are you saying? Yes, dad. We have a sketch that will trap anyone. Basi Reddy won't stand a chance but... before he dies, he should see Bujji succeed. Bujji should play and he should be there to witness it. What say? -Whatever you say, bro. My daughter-in-law should agree. Not him. -Tell him. You're thinking in the right track. But he should let Bujji play, right? Yes. He's the School Chairman. He'll use his power to stop her. Sister, what am I here for? I'll make Bujji play on the field and Basi Reddy off the field. See you. Let's go, bro. What are you planning to do, bro? You see how furious everyone is? We can't tell them to calm down. -True. So we should make Bujji play and win somehow. They won't be so furious anymore. They'll give up on the idea of killing Basi Reddy. Simple! Bro, that's so smart. What's our next move? Uchith Shah! [public hailing MLA Narsa Reddy] Being in power is so hot! Everyone's singing praises of me. [public hailing Minister Narsa Reddy] I'm just an MLA, right? We love you, bro. We want a picture with you. Please smile, bro. I'm an MLA. Why are you calling me Minister? Come on! You still want to be an MLA? Didn't you get the news? -No. You'll be the 1st Minister of Devaralanka. -Yes, brother. How can you be so sure? It's confirmed. You know Uchith Shah, right? Delhi! -Oh, yeah. Shah Ji. Shah's PA is close friends with my uncle. -So what? He called my uncle and said that Shah is recommending you for Ministry. Really?! -Yes, brother. Stop it, will you? Dear, they seem suspicious to me. Why? -You know SI challenged my brother. She didn't know I'm on your side. Let it go. You'll be the 1st Minister of this town. I swear on you! [public hailing Minister Narsa Reddy] You might get a call from Shah any minute now. Look. There it is. It's him. -Answer it and turn on the speaker. Hello. Hello, Narsa Reddy. I'm Mr. Shah's PA. Sir wants to talk to you. I told you so. Turn on the speaker. Hello, Narsa Reddy. This is Uchith Shah. -Shah Ji, namaste. Is Gangaraju there? -Yeah, right in front of me. So, listen. You have a shot at Ministry. But you must do something for it. What should I do, Shah Ji? -You must elevate your image. Elevate till where? He means till Delhi. -Oh, got it. How do I do that? Gangaraju will brief you on what to do. Follow him for a golden chance. -I will. I will. Don't miss it. -No chance, Shah Ji. Good luck on the Ministry. -Thank you. What do you say now? Gangaraju, my Ministry is in your hands. Consider it done, brother. But... -But what? What?! You shouldn't forget us once the job is done. -Yes, brother. How can I forget? I just got to know about your vast network. I don't think madam understands yet. I'll make her understand. First tell me how to become a Minister. I will. But please let go of my hand. Let's cover every sector. -Done. Pray that your job should be done and break the coconut. Govinda... -Govinda! [public hailing Minister Narsa Reddy] Bro, do it with passion. What's next? Isn't the Women's Welfare Sector is a bit much? You and I know that. But that idiot doesn't. What's next, Raju? Ganga... -Yes? Help me out here. -Sorry. You're going to be the Minister. Not me. I'll become the Minister, right? -Consider it done. Go on. What's next? Long Live, Bapu Ji. -Swatch Bharat Zindabad! What's next? We'll send these videos to Uchith Shah and wait for his response. There he goes. Let me answer it. Hello, Shah Ji. -Hello, Narsa Reddy. Publicity is really good. Keep going. You've covered every sector except for one. Which one? Sports Ministry. Do that as well. You'll definitely be a Minister. All the best. -Okay, Shah Ji. Bro, congrats. Ministry is confirmed. -Thank you. Let's cover the sports department as well. Hey! Do we have any sports players? -Come on, bro! Who's a better athlete than you! Everybody knows what a big player you are! Shall I put on a cheer-leading outfit, dear? I don't think I can handle the hotness. Bro! Bro...! -Yes, Raju. We'll use this item when you try for CM. First, encourage one of the girls at school. -Sure. And who is that? What does he think he's doing? You know my dispute with that girl, right? If she plays in my presence, I'll be humiliated. Don't get furious. His Ministry is in our best interest. Until then, please be patient. Who the hell told you that he'd be a Minister? Uchith Shah from the Center Govt. called. Uchith Shah? -Yes. Go, girl! You were fabulous, Bujji. Come here. That goal was so cool. Listen up, everyone! I'm announcing her as the Captain of the school team. You should win the trophy and thrust me all the way till Delhi. That's tough, sir. He's saying you should achieve great things. I'll try, sir. -Good. [public hailing Minister Narsa Reddy] Bujji! Thank you, Gangaraju. I have another surprise for you. -What? Really?! Dad! Go. Congratulations! I'm proud of you. Thank you, Gangaraju. It's okay. Now I know what I've missed all these days. Whatever happens from now on... family is my priority. Promise? -Promise! Sister, I want to tell you this as my brother. Husband and wife could have a million differences. But in our society, there are many monsters like Basi Reddy. In order to save our women from them... a father's support is highly essential. Why did you bring me here? What have I done wrong? Shh!!! You were so cute in there. I couldn't help but pull you aside. So... So... You've helped Bujji play and get her family back together. I know. Now kill Basi Reddy as soon as possible. We'll plan our wedding right after. Why do you bring him up at this time? Come, let us both plan our future. You'll have to wait until the wedding. You're a grown woman. You should understand my pain. [romantic song] Where are they? Bro... Bro... Bro... Bro... Who is it? -It's me, bro. Hey! To hell with you! Get out of here! It's urgent. Come on out once. Bro! Bro, are you listening? Come on out! -Calm down! I'm coming! Idiot! What's so urgent? Couldn't you wait? I could. But your father doesn't seem to. What are you saying? -Basi Reddy and him... Come with me. Hey, Basi Reddy! By 10 AM tomorrow at the Ammoru temple... you're going to be dead, mark my words. Stop mouthing off. It takes more than muscle to kill Basi Reddy. Guts! It takes guts! If your son is gutsy enough, I'm ready! He isn't just gutsy... -Dad! Dad! Calm down! He'll chop you into pieces for touching my daughter-in-law. What do you say, dear? -Yes, uncle. Let me go! Come on, guys! Let's announce his death. We'd like to announce to the public of Devaralanka that... by 10 AM tomorrow at the Ammoru temple... My son Gangaraju is going to kill Basi Reddy. Basi Reddy won't spare us. He'll kill us! This is going to be our last supper. Last supper? What does that mean? Last feast, my friend. Why did you stop, bro? Holy shucks! What the hell! Looks like we can't have a last feast either. Before we become his feast, please do something, bro. They've planned it big. What are we going to do now? Hey! He can't get away! Go look for him! Hey, where's Athreya? There he is! Hurry up, man! Athreya! -What's up, bro! What are you doing? -I want to have one last peg before I die. They're coming for us! Come on! Run! Bhadrappa, listen to me. Come on, guys! You're so dead! -Bhadrappa, listen to me. Bhadrappa, I know you're not going to listen to me. We didn't light the smoke to kill you. We did it to escape. I hope you understand the value of life. Get lost! How come you're so confident, bro! Basi Reddy will be here in 10 minutes. We're literally shitting our pants. -Yeah, bro. He won't show up. -What are you saying? Do you know what happened after Bhadrappa's attack yesterday? What happened? Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! I love your hanger. You killed it with this one. I'm impressed. Can I sit down? Never mind. I'll sit down. Can I have a drink? Never mind. I'll have a peg. What brings you here, gangster? I'll tell you, bro. Can I have some pickle first? Don't you have pickle? It's okay. Bro, the thing is, I know who you are. You know me really well. But Uma Devi is silly. She doesn't know you. Let it go. Let it go? -Yeah. No way! Then I won't let it go either. -What do you mean? Are you going to kill me? Me kill you? No, bro. The thing is... Uma Devi is going to be my wife. It'll look bad if I lose in front of her. So... listen to me... and don't show up at the center. Here. Have this. Nice! She challenges me. Your father announces it to the whole town. You plead me not to show up tomorrow. Are you guys messing with me? Hey, Gangaraju! I'll strip her naked in front of your eyes tomorrow. I'll kill you and make her rot in hell for life! Sorry, bro. That was a reflex. So you've decided? Alright. What else can I do now? Let's see what the one above has decided for us. See you. You drink. You eat. Bye. What is it, bro? Are you going to kill me? We have until tomorrow, right? Move it! Over! It's all over! -What are you talking about? Uchith Shah knows about the fight between Basi Reddy and Uma Devi. How do you know that? His uncle must've gotten a call. Why do you care? Go inside! Go on. Uchith Shah is upset. Hence, he refused to offer Ministry. Upset? -Yes. If Basi Reddy and I fight in the center now... What? Everyone will know that you killed Siddhappa. Oh, my god! Your MLA seat will go down the drain. -Down the drain. You'll definitely end up on the streets. -Definitely! Don't worry, brother. I'm your man. That is why I requested Basi Reddy not to show up. But he isn't listening, which calls for your expertise. He doesn't listen to anyone. In that case, I'm done with you and your Ministry. I'm going. Don't leave me hanging, please. -I can't do it, bro. Okay, let go. There's only one way to stop him. -What's that? We should injure Rangamma. -For the Ministry? But how? This is how. -What's that? I'll tell you. Oh! Oil! Madam... -Rangamma! Brother is missing you badly. Here I come, dear. -Can't wait. Oh, my god! It hurts so bad! -Look. She's badly injured. She broke her leg. -You look absolutely fine. You made it sound like you were dying. Aren't you going to visit until I die? As kids... -Enough of your nonsense! I'll kill Gangaraju and be back. Brother-in-law... One last thing. -What? Give me that. Come aside for a minute. It's personal. Shut the door! -What the hell are you guys doing? Bro, you're unbelievable! -That was one solid plan! Now watch my performance! Hello. Really?! Alright, I'll tell him. Basi Reddy isn't coming! He's hiding from Gangaraju out of fear. It doesn't make sense to compete with someone like him. Let's go. Call that bugger. Which bugger? -Basi Reddy. No. I won't talk to that coward. I'll talk to him. You call him, dear. Brother, be aggressive. -Of course. I'm not scared of him. Turn on the speaker. -Okay. Hello. -Hey, Basi Reddy! Dad! -Are you hiding from my son? What the hell are you saying? I stayed back because my sister's unwell. I'll be there tomorrow. I'll show everyone what Basi Reddy is made of. I've had enough of your exaggerations on the phone. If you're a man, come here. If you're afraid, fall on my wife's feet and apologize. I'll spare you. Think about it. Death or Forgiveness! Choice is yours! What's with all the aggression, bro? I cut the call as soon as I grabbed the phone. Shah Ji is calling, which means he has calmed down. Turn on the speaker. Shah Ji, namaste. -Namaste. Gangaraju told me everything. Our committee members have decided to give you a chance. Shah Ji, thank you! But you must do something for us. -What is it? Make Basi Reddy fall on the SI's feet and apologize. Make him do what? Make your brother-in-law Basi Reddy fall on the SI's feet and apologize. Why are you quiet, Narsi? Don't you want the Ministry? -I do, I do. Then get this done. All the best! Basi Reddy... Come here. Uchith Shah just called. He said that the Ministry is confirmed. But you have to do me a small favor. -What? You know that SI Uma Devi, right? I want you to fall on her feet and... -What?! Just a small apology. That's all. How dare you ask me that! It was me who killed Siddhappa and made you the MLA. Brother, no! -Now I'm going to kill you for that seat. Are you going to kill him or what? What's going on? He should become the Minister. It's in our best interest. Best interest, my foot! He's lucky to be the MLA. If you think he'll be Minister, you're delusional. Why is he talking like this? Something is going on. Breaking news! Uchith Shah, who's been to the US 15 days back, is returning home. This evening... Uchith Shah called you from America? -Yes. Give me your phone. -What for? Give it to me! Why does he yell, man? Why is he cutting my call? Do you know who spoke to you just now? -Shah Ji. It wasn't Shah Ji, you idiot! It was Gangaraju. Him and his friends are playing with you. You'll be the first Minister of this town. I promise. Let's manage every sector. Uchith Shah is upset. Who's more athletic than you here? Dear... What's wrong? [public hailing Minister Narsa Reddy] That's enough, guys. Now I understand what a dimwit you are. He made such fools out of you guys And how did you believe that you were going to be Minister? Don't you have the slightest idea about politics? No. -What did you study? Finger print batch, huh? No matter how illiterate you are, didn't you get suspicious when he made you braid women's hair? On top of that, she assisted you. I was under the delusion that I'd become a Minister. Say what you want. But if he fooled a powerful man like you, I'm sure he's extraordinary. He's a tiger! What next? Basi Reddy! Why do you hide from my son and then show off when he's not around? Save your heroism for my son Gangster Gangaraju. Gangster! Gangster! Gangster! Hey, old man. First figure out how your son became a gangster. Enlighten him. Gangaraju didn't kill Siddhappa. Basi Reddy did. You heard him! I kept it a secret, as I was afraid for my brother-in-law's Ministry. He took advantage of that! Your son shivered and stared as I killed Siddhappa in cold blood. But you guys hailed him as a gangster. You announced my death like a procession. I could kill you all right now if I wanted to. But you must watch him die. Tell him that. Tell your son that! He's only going to live for a couple of hours. He'll be dead by sunrise. Bhadrappa, we didn't light the smoke to kill you. We did it to escape. I hope you understand the value of life. Brother, Gangaraju didn't kill your father. Basi Reddy did. Nagaraju, your gangster's here. We thought he'll make our lives better. But he messed with Basi Reddy and put us at risk. This father-son have made fools out of us. What the hell are you saying? Don't yell at us. Looks like Basi Reddy is going to avenge the whole town because of you. We're worried about our lives. This is our karma, people. Let's go. Dad! Uma... I know why you did all this. But you made a huge mistake by hiding the truth till now. You think this is my revenge? No. It's this town's revenge. It's your revenge. You may not be a gangster. But I believe you're a man. That is why I want to tell you a truth about your cousin sister Pooja. Have you ever seen the mother and daughter again? Do you at least know what happened? What happened to them? -Find out for yourself. Come with me. What happened, uncle? Happy birthday to you! Happy long life to Mahalakshmi! -My baby! Happy long life to you! My baby! Baby... Mahalakshmi! Mahalakshmi! You killed her! You killed my baby! My brother Gangaraju won't spare your life! We didn't tell you because you'd be heart broken. You named your sister's daughter after your mother. But that monster... he killed a baby without any mercy. Your mother has died again, Gangaraju. That is why we wanted to see him dead. We didn't expect your sister's wailing to go unnoticed. He killed a baby without any mercy. My brother Gangaraju won't spare your life! Your mother has died again, Gangaraju. That is why we wanted to see him dead. You think this is my revenge? No. It's this town's revenge. Your revenge. Dad! Dad? If you remembered that I'm your dad, we wouldn't be in this situation. No matter how notorious you were since childhood, I defended you because you're a motherless child. I hoped you'd change someday. I celebrated the fact that you'll change this town's fate. But you made me stand in public like a loser. I wish Siddhappa rather killed me than live to see this. I'd proudly claim that my son's a gutsy man. Shame on you! Mom, I didn't intend on cheating anyone like everyone believes. I tried to tell the truth at every opportunity possible. But when I saw people live a life of courage and joy, I silenced myself. I intended something. And the almighty did something else. Even dad... he said he wishes I'm dead. I don't find any other choice, mom. I wish you were here. I want to lie down on your lap and sleep. It's 10 AM. Where is Gangster Gangaraju? Did he run away? Where is he? We looked everywhere. We couldn't find him. You heard him! Gangster Gangaraju is nowhere to be found. He ran away! Brother-in-law, you're her husband from now on. Put her in the car. Hold on. If he fled the town, how did he screw your lives? Do I seem like a fool to you? We assumed that he fled town, Thakur Saab. But he didn't. He returned. And this time, more powerful than ever. He was a whole new person. Brother, I wouldn't go near him if I was you. He's ready to kill or die. Don't mess with him! Nab him, guys! We shall decide who the bigger man is. Grandpa... -What is it? Gangaraju is fighting Basi Reddy. You trusted him and challenged me for a duel. Is he your mighty gangster? Gangaraju, you deal with him. I'll handle these silly kids. Let's fight! Gangaraju, I accept my defeat. Let me go. I'll fall at her feet. Please let me go. Spare me. Gangaraju, no matter what he does, he shouldn't be alive. Many lives have been destroyed due to their atrocities. All of them want to see him dead. Kill him! Kill him right now! Narsa Reddy signing off! [public hailing Gangster Gangaraju] Gangaraju... We may not share a blood relation. But we shared vengeance. Hereafter, you'll always have Bhadrappa's support. [public hailing Gangster Gangaraju] Thus, he killed Basi Reddy and became a real gangster. We got lucky and escaped from him. But I ended up on the streets, with no power or prestige. If I want my power back, he should be dead. Thakur Saab, please kill that gangster. Please! I beg you! Don't touch it! I get it. Chotu, summon Gangaraju here. Call him! -Yes, call him! That's him, Thakur Saab. Namaste, Thakur Saab. Stop kidding, my dear nephew! Hey, dimwit! Don't you get it yet? Bachchan Thakur is my uncle Buchi Raju. As ferocious as a tiger! But you've got to admit. Listening to a hero's story in the villain's words is out of the world. So I was your pastime till now? This was the finishing touch! Bhadrappa! Let's go home, uncle. Dad made wild steak for you. This gun doesn't suit your personality. Take this and shoot him! RIP, Narsi! Gangster Gangaraju! Stop calling him Gangster Gangaraju. Don't you see the transformation? Change the goddamn title. MLA Gangaraju!
