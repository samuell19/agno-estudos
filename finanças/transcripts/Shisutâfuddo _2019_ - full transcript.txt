SISTERHOOD That's why I'm not going to shut up. And I'll say it again: I want to denounce sexism in my own words. Yuto IKEDA - Film Director. - Morning. - Good morning. May I have a copy? What happened to your chin? Oh, yeah… - Maybe take that off for the photo. - That's the plan. - Just tuck in your chin. - Right. - Thanks for sending the preview. - Thanks for watching. - So you're taking on a new subject. - Yes, that's right. I'd like to ask what made you want to explore it. I felt that as a man, you sympathize greatly with the situation. I've been feeling uneasy about living in Japan these days. There's a status quo of male supremacy and pay inequality… A married couple can't have different surnames… Sexual exploitation… How it's considered virtuous for women to stay at home and serve men… Those kinds of… I'm uneasy with ideas of “manliness” or “womanliness.” And other than that… same-sex marriage is illegal here. Which means this country is way behind in human rights. I'm a man, but it's important for me that all people are treated equally. Which I guess makes me a feminist. A feminist? I mean, I don't care too much about labels. But for people who aren't able to speak up… Like, minorities… I'd like to try and be a voice for them. So I'm looking at how I can do that through filmmaking. I hope that doesn't make me sound arrogant... Oh, not at all. But I do have this vision for… Excuse me, is it okay if I smoke...? Sorry, there's no smoking indoors. Right… My Voice. In terms of the women speaking frankly about their experiences on-camera… I could relate to that. But honestly speaking… and I apologize if this sounds rude… It wasn't clear to me what you were trying to say. For example, I'm a woman. You're a man. And between us, there's a ll gulf that can't be bridged. Why is a male director taking on this subject? I can definitely relate to it, and the idea of making a film about it. But how shall I put this… As a film… I'm sorry. It was boring. - It felt very tedious. - Oh, I see... What were you ultimately trying to say with this film? In one line, what would your message be? It would be… “Protecting the dignity of the individual.” I guess. Dignity…? You don't feel it? Like, someone has their hands around your throat? A bad feeling like you're being oppressed? Well… I'm pretty stolid. Okay, I'll be taking a few photos… ready? Oh, your bandage... - It's better to not see it, right? - Yes, I'll take it off. It's okay, we don't see it. Are you sure? Can you tuck in your chin? One point for your razor, huh? I'm going to keep shooting. Try putting your left hand on a corner of the poster. Good, I'll take a few like this. BOMI - Singer. Can you put this over there please? That's not it, 'cause really, it's just that I only wanted to see you again… Hey, that star over there just winked at us. Don't let go of my hand in your hand... Because I'm just so lonely… You can't understand that, can you? Oh, someday it'll all disappear… A snowman... Love's charming spell... That's not it, 'cause really, it's just that I only wanted a chance to cry… The moon glimmers in the candle light. Don't roll your eyes and walk away… Because I just can't stand the pain... Will you stay by my side until I fall asleep? Oh, sugar heart, melt away already… Like sweet, sweet ice cream… Let's do telepathy; Read each other's minds… All day long! Imitation… Illumination… Let's go see the lights together! That's not it, 'cause really, it's just that I only wanted to hear you again… I don't need this from anyone else… Hey, Teddy Boy, I'll give it to you… A chocolate-coated straight-jab! Dal Segno, I wanna spacewalk… if it's with you… I don't mind if it's just a picture… Let's stay together… Hey, let's stay together! Hey, let's stay together! Thank you! Just saw your message. It's up here. I got here pretty early. - There's lots of people here... - Oh wow. She's here… It's been so long! Do you remember me? Ms. Kimura…? Yes! So happy you hadn't forgotten… You look great! Want a drink? We've got booze… Oh my gosh, I'm so nervous! So many people… Every single day. Dinner's ready when I get home. I can literally see the shape of happiness. It's so nice you have a sweet husband. Really. I thank God. But that's not it… It's so old-fashioned to think one partner should stay home. I get it too. I make dinner on my days off. Now that's a meal I'd like to taste! Essentially, for men and women... lesbian or gay... What society demands... like customs and standards? It's all shit. People should just live any way they want. 'Cause basically, it's about human relationships, right? Absolutely. I mean, if not, what's the point? You've got one chance! Yup. Like, daily life versus expectations? Exactly! Good morning. Hello. Goodbye. Is that “enjoying life?” Come see my movie with your husband. Are you listening? - Huh? See what? - My movie. - That's not what I'm talking about. - It's not? You know what? The thing with people… is that we're all gonna die someday. My dad was having stomach problems… But he's still healthy. What about your family, Yuka? Well… How about you, Ikeda? Both my parents passed away. Oh, sorry, man. Back when I was in middle school! And we will too, someday. Well, yeah. If only this would never end… Cheers. Kimura... She was over the top. She seems so happy. Her husband has it rough. He doesn't even drink! You've met him? Yeah, he's an actor. Theatre and stuff. She made the first move. Can you believe it? She ambushed him outside a theatre to exchange business cards. And hers says “Attorney at Law” on it. Guess that was pretty attractive to a wanna-be actor. So I went to see one of his shows. He wasn't exactly good. Did you notice Kimura's watch? It looked super-expensive! I guess lawyers rake in a ton of cash… That's not very nice. People need her services. It's only natural. I hate it when you say “wanna-be” or “raking in cash.” What time do you work tomorrow? Is it a photo shoot? Hey, so… I think I might go abroad. That's nice, where to? Canada when? For like, a week? I probably won't come back. I think I want to live there. What do you mean? I plan on living there for a while. I already told my agency. My mom doesn't have much longer... Everything look okay? If you can sign it and include your personal seal... - So, I wanted to ask about the fee. - Sure. What's your policy for secondary use? Like, for online. Right, online... Well, we don't really do that. So that means… - Additional payments, I'm afraid, aren't included. That's always been our policy. It's just the modelling fee. And I think that's pretty standard, when it comes to stuff like online. I wonder about that. Well, you can mail it in later if you want. But then the deposit will be the month after next. Anyway, please think about it. Manami Usamaru - Nude Model. What's the big deal, you guys? - Uh oh! - Cutie! But I'm not nude! Nice. Doesn't look like Lake Yamanaka at all. So, I'm doing another fashion show. I saw it. For Mikio Sakabe Show. I have that same one… Is it empty? Thanks. - Did you cut your hair? - A bit, yeah. It's cute. Like a mushroom. Hey. Tiger. Where did you get the dinosaur? I've had it since I was a kid. I think we used the tiger before. Let's get a drink soon. Salaryman. Is that the bar where the guy bought us a drink? Yeah, and he didn't even introduce himself. Pretty badass... Like, “Courtesy of the guest who just left…”. I mean, damn! It was like, a regular old dude. Nothing special. Let's do another angle. - How is it? - It's good. Thanks for the other day. So you're joining the parade today? Yeah, I thought I'd check it out. Miho Eda - University Student. Good evening everyone, I'm BOMI! Are you having fun? Awesome. Please stick around to the very end. What day is it again? Thursday. Middle of the week. Just past. Thank you so much, again, for coming. I don't think you came here just to see me tonight. But I think it's meaningful that we're all here together. It's not a long show, but I hope you enjoy it. Thanks again! Why did you decide to become a nude model? Was it body confidence? I'm not confident… It's hard. I'm so not confident… I wonder why I do nudes… - My mom hasn't reached out. - Why not? Since when? I think from the time her Alzheimer's started getting worse. That's recent. But you know, I think it was kind of my fault. So that's what you think... Well, because… My dad said: “Mom is crying every day.” He said, “It's only going to get worse. So stop it.” And that scares me, right? But then a few days later, my mom contacts me as if nothing happened. Like, for day-to-day things. She's perfectly normal. And when I asked my dad or my family about it... they say she's getting really forgetful. Then suddenly I'll get an email from her that says: “Come to your senses and quit that job!” And then there's no response when I ask what she means by that… No answer. So I asked my sister about it. “Mom forgot she even sent that. So I erased the email for you before she remembers it.” But there's nothing we can do about it because it's Alzheimer's. I guess I'll get dementia too... I want to hurry up and lose my memory. But there's all kinds of love. Like, the love you have for friends… For partners, for family. There's all kinds. But when you hear the word “love... it seems so cut and dried. Any time someone's said it to me or I've said it myself... I wonder if it's really true. Sometimes I lose sleep over it. But… There's something there... It's hard to verbalize. Like you have to take responsibility for it because you're a woman. That's it. Yeah, I'm not sure how to define the feeling… Hey, did you get a haircut? How far back was it? 3 years? Longer. Right… It's all so vague. A crappy memory. Why? It wasn't any fun at all. Wasn't it? Well, it was your fault! You always worry about what people think. It's so exhausting. You have no idea. - You don't know anything, do you? - Of course I do. - What do you know? - Everything. Whatever. I get it. I didn't cut my hair, by the way. Come on. You just weren't paying attention. Let's break up. I feel like you're holding me back. I'm suffocating. - Is that what you came to tell me? - Nope. But I've been thinking it all along. Haven't you? Let's go sit down. I'm hungry.-Me too. I don't have the courage to go over there. Good night! You look so happy. - Say hi to your husband for me. - I will. Catch you later. Sorry, I need to head out. Thank you so much. I'll email you. That watch is super-cute! It was a birthday gift from my husband. Oh wow. It's good for blind people too. If you feel it, you can tell the time by touch. - Whoa… - I want to try… Looks expensive. This one's for minutes... and this one's for hours. That's so cool! So my husband's an actor. Once, he played a blind character, and discovered it while doing research. It's pretty chic, isn't it? - I'm jealous. I want one too! - Any present. Really cute. Ширээт галерей. Remember the couple that was here earlier? Yeah. The guy is coming to our university next week. Okay? Who? A director, I think. Never saw him before. I wonder if he left. Our professor was here too. - For which course? - Journalism. What? You're taking journalism? Of course! I love politics! You should come with me one day. But I'm really not interested... - There's a good restaurant nearby... - What kind? - Pancakes. - What, pancakes? - I thought you'd like that! - No way! - Oh shit… - Is she okay? Why don't we take a few shots here. Lean in a bit closer please… ready? Can you step forward a bit? Ready? Amazing. - Good thing it was cooler out today. - Perfect weather. - But there are so many mosquitoes… - Did you get bitten? Yeah, I saw them swarming you… So itchy... You two are super photogenic. Makes my job so easy. - Yay! - No bad angles. - I think I'm a bit taller… - Yeah, a little bit. - It's well-balanced. - Cool. It all looks great. So, in journalism... information is collected over time and facts are checked. Quotes are selected impartially to create balance. The foundations of journalism are objectivity and neutrality. Now, I'll read out a description of what documentary is: About this incomprehensible world. It is a subjective sketch of a baffling world situation by an individual filmmaker. There's that word “sketch.” Fragments of reality captured on film are... reconstructed to create a “personal” fiction. This relates to what I've been talking about, but… I had the opportunity to attend a special screening given by director Sato... When are you leaving, Yuka? - In a week. - That's so soon. Yeah, it hasn't hit me yet. So I guess you're taking time off work? Well, yeah. Makes sense… Are your parents still healthy? Yeah, you're still young. Are yours ill? Cancer. You never know… My mom was pretty active. Are you enjoying it? The work? I just started, so I'm not really sure yet. But I really like being in front of the camera. I can become another “me.” I'm not my own biggest fan... What do you mean? I feel fuzzy. Like I don't stand out. But you're still in high school. That's normal. But when you're popular, you're really popular. There's no point comparing. I think it's more about you living your own best life. Yuka, you really do have teacher qualities. That doesn't feel like a compliment... Well, it's not a term I came up with... - But my ex told me I have it… - Really, what? Self-respect. Yeah, I got that word from him, if nothing else. I'm really happy you joined the agency. I had no friends at all. Me neither. People are so intimidating. Even at school, I eat lunch alone. That's so sad! So you want to be an actress? I'm really interested in acting. Yeah, movies and TV series are great. I wanted to work a lot too. Mr. Ikeda, thank you so much. What you shared was really important. I'm glad we invited you. Actually, if any of you have time... Mr. Ikeda would like to interview some of you… right? Yes, thank you so much for having me. So, my next project is about… young people living in Tokyo under various circumstances. It will be an omnibus film that covers different lifestyles. And if you're interested, I'd love to interview you on-camera. I would be asking you a series of questions. Topics will include student loans, work-study balance, things like that. If you'd like to participate, please let me know. I can assure you that I won't simply take your interview footage and use it. I'll ask for your permission first, so you won't have to worry about that. And I apologize for the small amount... but I'm offering a $30 fee for your trouble. Thank you so much. Thank you! We look forward to your future work. Thanks again for coming. Thank you so much! It was really very interesting. I hope I didn't overload them… Hey… let's do it. I don't want to go alone. And we can get some money. And say what? I don't have anything to say. And it's a measly $30. I know, it's like, nothing. - Let's spend it on lunch. - Right, on pancakes! - Thanks for coming. - Here goes nothing. - You can relax, it's okay. - Thank you. So, I'll jump right in… Have you felt any hardship as a woman? Yes, I feel confronted by lots of things. People have many sides… I feel I'm quickly put in a category, after just a short conversation. I often get asked, because I'm single right now... if I'm seeing anyone. And when I say no, they tell me I should be. From there, they ask if I have any intention of getting married. And then they say I should have kids as early as possible. They think it's right to just... impose on me. That may not be their intention, but... Being on the receiving end, it feels like a burden. Well, I think… it's been going on since way before I was born. But in society, over the last 30-odd years. I don't think women's opinions have really been respected. Men are the standard, so if a woman makes an important statement... she'll get asked why she said that. Because she's just a woman. The phrase “just a woman” makes me uncomfortable. So, yes… I'd like to learn more so I can speak up more. I've taken out a student loan. It's $10,000 a year for 4 years. And with interest, I'll come to $60,000. When I think about repaying all that money... I honestly wonder how I'll be able to afford it. In Japan, there aren't really any scholarships available. So in that sense, I think it's better abroad. Yeah, I really hate the fact that they don't exist here. I'm not actually a student at this university. But I go by the name Manami Usamaru, and I'm a nude model. Thank you. So, you're a nude model, for photos? Yes, mostly for photography. Great. So, first... I'd like to ask if you ever feel hardship as a woman. Hardship as a woman… I wonder… From having chosen nude modelling as a career… as a woman, I don't feel much hardship. If anything, before I started this job… I felt like I was living “as a woman” rather than as a person. So right now, I don't feel any hardship. But back when I was in my teens... I didn't really… well, no… I used to go through life comparing myself to others. I'm the youngest of 6 siblings. And most of us are women. So I'd compare myself to my sisters. As women. And I could never measure up to them. On the surface, I was just a girl like any of them. But… I couldn't seem to live as well as they could. And when I realized this… I used my femininity to try and make a living. So... I slept with a lot of people. So yes, I think I relied on my “feminine wiles” to survive. But that was… very painful for me. Nowadays... I really don't want to do that anymore. Basically... I thought I wanted to die before I turned 20. And to prepare for my death... I wanted a nude “portrait of the deceased.” Looking back on it now, it sounds pretty crazy... But at the time, I was really at wit's end. I wanted to see my natural body, in a beautiful… Well, not beautiful... but in a pristine state. In a photograph. I wanted to make it so that the old me didn't exist. But really, thanks to having had that picture taken… I kind of gave up. There I was, with nothing at all. I didn't think I was anything special. Until now... the idea of comparing myself to others became absurd. Like, I am me. I might have nothing, but I realized there's only one me. And now, I'm glad I became a nude model. That's about it. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. His nickname is Rin-Rin! This was my first time up here on stage. And I had a lot of fun. Thank you so much! Are you serious? I haven't done a solo show in a while... And the huge gap I had between shows… means there's so much more out there drawing our attention.. That it'd be normal for you to just forget about me. But so many of you remembered me and came out tonight. You thought about coming back to see me. And for that, I'm really grateful. Thank you all so much. Hello, The World! I've spent many years... getting to be your age. Hello, The World! Growing hidden feelings... Growing into adulthood. And now, in my heart... I've given birth to this melody... A song I want to play for you... I heard it, my mother's voice... I heard her laugh... Thank you. Yes, thank you so much! So, I don't think male supremacy… will ever go away. Equality? I don't think it'll happen. Being cut down when you raise your voice... I think that's pretty Japanese. We should not try to clarify things. Women who state their opinions aren't accepted. Ambiguity is… valued in our culture. Basically, the system is broken. Like, when it comes to child rearing... the system makes it impossible to go back to work. If there were a little more support... I think women could live more meaningful lives. I read the other day about British actor Benedict Cumberbatch. He said he'd refuse all contracts where his female costars earned less than him. I thought that was really progressive. When men like him... have more power and influence… Rather, the moment he announced it... it became so obvious that this world is still male-dominated. Same thing with the Weinstein situation. We need more brave men to stand up for us. If women raise their voices, they'll just get beaten down. They'll accuse you of being a feminist... As if that were some outrageous notion. It gives me hope when courageous men like him come forward. We don't really see that in Japan. I want to keep expressing myself in this life. Any way I can. Maybe someday it'll be poetry... Or it could be acting or music. Or in the form of an essay. The medium doesn't really matter. The ideas I had, the things I witnessed, the way I've felt… I want to leave… a record of it. Starting with day-to-day things... I want to strengthen my ability to be happy. Basically, I think happiness is a choice. It comes down to sensitivity. I think one's ability to feel happiness makes for a happy life. Everything will be Okay “Chara” doesn't really work as a nickname, does it… Getting used to autographing? Yup, I've been practicing at my part-time job. Who cares about the work! Thank you very much. Would you mind taking a selfie with my phone? Wait, just me by myself? Yes.-Really? I'm nervous. You don't have to… I'll delete it if it doesn't work out. This phone is huge! - Do you want to use an app? - No, it's okay. - Wait... You're watching? - I wanted a shot of this too! It's shaky! Is this okay? It's cute! Thank you! I wanted to come and learn more. So thanks for having me. It's a kind of pressure that kills your self-confidence… As if your freedom were being taken away… It's a field I'm really interested in... I want to explore the history of feminism in Japan. We are not flowers… we are fireworks. A letter from the past. Words for the future. Tokyo, in the last summer of the Heisei era. The 21st century. Me. You. Us. I felt like I could become a different me. But that didn't happen. I was searching for the distance between us. You weren't looking at me at all. We were in a dream that became reality. But the dream must come to an end. Like, sticking out in a negative way, being criticized… As if there could never be a Japanese Madonna. Like, Madonna's so cool… And Lady Gaga, she's awesome. So, I don't think male supremacy… will ever go away. And equality? I wanted a nude “portrait of the deceased.” Looking back on it now, it sounds pretty crazy... A status update? Sure, I have one. My status has been updated. That sounds weird... I had my major debut back in 2012. But back then, and the following year, and the year after that... I couldn't perform in the festival. But this year, it's been decided: I'm in! I want to keep expressing myself in this life. Any way I can. Maybe someday it'll be poetry... Or it could be acting or music. The ideas I had, the things I witnessed, the way I've felt… I want to leave… a record of it. Starting with day-to-day things. I want to strengthen my ability to be happy. Basically, I think happiness is a choice. It comes down to sensitivity. I think one's ability to feel happiness makes for a happy life. Yuka… You didn't have to come all this way. Well, I didn't get to see you the other day. I'm so tired. What time's your flight? Ten… I should go soon. I feel lonely already. Please keep in touch, okay? We have to stay true to ourselves no matter what. Self-Respect. That's my line! It's my line now. Can I update you on my projects? Of course, I'll be looking forward to it! Thank you so much. May I take your picture? Everything will be okay. Pass me the camera. I want to take a photo too. Ready? The customer you have dialed is not available. Please leave a message after the tone. Director Takashi Nishihara.
