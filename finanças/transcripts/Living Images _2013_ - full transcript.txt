Coming, coming... Who's talking? - Uncle Jull, it's me. Hello, Paul. Coming home? - Listen, would you try to clean up the cinema room a little bit? But why? An agent wants to see the house. Well, I can clean alright. That's all I can do. Uncle Julius? Julius! - Yeah! I'm here! Oh, I have never been here. What are you doing? Your brother told me to clean all this up. I don't know where to start. Why? - I take it that he's selling the house. You haven't heard? Wait. See what I found. Ok. I don't know if I'm even allowed to touch it. Show it, please. There are no good times, nor bad. There's only this moment we have. Look, Old Mamma How old is she there? Quite young, I can't remember. Did you make this movie? - No, I didn't. Old Mamma loved to sit in a cafe, and so she got into a movie. I edited her out of there and made a new reel. Why? - What is life then, but a movie? Somewhere you are edited... - Where? Some bits are ok, some are garbage. And in the end... - What's in the end? In the end, nobody remembers a thing. Have you known Old Mamma that long? Since my birth. There was a cinema here even before I was born The Baron renovated it from a carriage shed. And my father showed the "living images", as they were called. The machines were driven by crank. Living Images Ruptured century - Broken hearts. During the revolution in 1905, the Baron's manor was looted. And then he finally moved to the city with his family. Well, it wasn't a real family anymore. His wife, a Russian Baroness had fled abroad. You do know that Old Mamma's mother was the Baron's maid. Barbarians, you're killing people with my globe! Wilhelmine, what is it! Parasite! Out of my house! I was born, when the First WW had started and my dad was taken to war too. I'm going to a real cinema now. To the cinema? Alone? Does Old Mamma let you? I'm not going alone but with friends and yes, she lets me. What are you going to see? - "Mummy". Mummy? - Like ?A mummy?! Listen... He said that Roberto is not my brother. Hey, Helmi, see what I brought you. What's that? - Don't you remember? Rosen's booze. Where did you find this? - Downstairs. Paul wants to sell the house. - Did you know? Sell? He can't! - He just called that he will. An agent is coming to see it. And I have to clean the place up. To whom? - How should I know? But I was born in this house. - Me too. No. I won't let him. I have an agreement with the city. It will become a children's music house. I know. You told me. Oh, if Erik were alive, he wouldn't let it happen. You do remember Erik, don't you? You were but a baby then. You don't remember a thing. But I do. The First World War was on, when I already played in the cinema. But Erik was a brave boy. Yeah, who could praise him enough! Gentlemen, it's already as bad as in St. Petersburg. The Red Navy has taken the city! Where's the vodka? Hold on, Wilhelm! He has a gun! They'll come looking for him! There are sailors below! Take him to the alley! Sidoroff came here! I really haven't seen anyone. Gentlemen, my new summer manor! Germany's victory is nigh! Cheers, gentlemen! We will nominate you, von Rosen as Minister of Economy and we'll flood Germany with vodka! The capital of the dukedom will be Riga. Estonians have proclaimed a republic! Manifest to the people of Estonia Papa, I'm going to fight for Independence! The whole school is going! You're not going anywhere Erich. This is not the Estonia to die for. That's the boy's mother, who fled to Italy! My dad is going to war again, but I'm not going to cry. Julius, you have to fight to earn your freedom! Your dad perished in battle and now you want to show ?living images? here. Erik, I'm going to tell Papa that you're smuggling booze! Enough of this lewdness! But we're going to marry, won't we, Erik? Erich, I found the right school for you. You will become a captain! JUri, find yourself a new buddy to end up in a Finnish jail with! But you tell me, where is my real father? I'm going with Erik. Well, the Germans are flying to the North Pole again. This is for Helmi. - I'll deliver it. From Germany, again. - Yes. Give it to me. Will you let me watch a film then? In secret? Or are you too proud? ?Mister Cinema?. - Give me the letter! Why don't you write her yourself, if you want to so much? The mail delivery? - Ah, yes. Nothing for me? Julius? Where are you going? - To propose! Dear God. To whom? The postgirl? The Baron can't have a single bad word to say about me! Maybe you'll wait another couple of years? It's so sad. Why do I have to suffer? Why do I have to live, when there's no you? You went with someone else, and won't come any more. I will not see you again or hear your voice. It's so sad. Why do I have to suffer? Why should I live, when there's no you? Wilhelmine, listen! It says that a treaty with England allows Germany to build up a navy again. This is a great victory! He writes that he will have to stay in Germany. Who? Erik! Who else have we been talking about all these years? Well, that's good news. The German navy is growing. What a fantastic career opportunity! You tricked him into this career! So that he wouldn't come home! You will become a great singer. Tell me! Am I right? You have connections everywhere! Yes, I'm grateful for the food and shelter, but if Erik's not coming here, I'll go there! - Wait! You don't know everything. Absurd! You made this up! You, my father? - Yes. And who's Erik then? - Your brother. Erik? My brother? - Yes. Half brother. Impossible. You're lying! - My dear! Haven't you realized it yourself? We should be happy now that you know, at least that's how I imagined it. You imagined! I'm 25 years old! - A perfect age! You knew this all the time and you're telling me only now? Wilhelmine! Did you think I should kiss your feet now? Don't talk to me this way! I'll talk how I please! Get out! Dear daughter! - Burn in hell! Juula! Julius! - Erik is out of the game! Dead? - Erich is out! Out! The grand seventy-five! Hirsch? Where is our present? - Oh, yeah! I wonder where the daughter is. The latest Zeiss optics. Ordered from Riga. Can you see the future with that? Of course! You have to know the right people, if you want to achieve anything. Who is that Hirsch? And that simple peasant boy who talks about flying? The Jew is the new bookkeeper of the Rosen distillery The other's the captain of their organization. The captain? An Estonian? - Yes. But why didn't Erich come home on that day to greet his father? Come in, come in, don't be shy. I'm the lawful mistress here. Wilhelmine! And the name of the mistress is not Wilhelmine von Strandmann anymore. It's simply Helmi Rannamaa. Youth will take over... I do apologise. Willi... All the best! We have to go, too. Taavi, what's our hurry? The party is just beginning. Indeed. Any news from Erik? - Not interested. Well, well... Does Miss... Helmi has someone else? But when will you find yourself a girlfriend? I've just set my eyes on you. Peasants will remain peasants. What's that supposed to mean? Don't you know? It's a national policy now. Taking Estonian names. Yes, but this is voluntary. Why Wilhelmine? What are you doing here? It's very late, you're supposed to be at work! Have a cookie and go! Now! Let's dance. Raims, play something joyful! How joyful? - Improvise. Where are you going? - Helmi, you know I don't know how. Yes, you can. Look. Helmi, please stop. Helmi, don't stop... Then JUri may become a dancer... Helmi, would you teach me so I could become a dancer here and now, As the rhythm of jazz has got into me, and this charming music plays. Helmi, would you show me a step or two of foxtrot right away, Just a few steps should be enough for me so I could just dance with thee. Shall we have a cup of coffee before the rehearsal? I think I'll skip the rehearsal! Do you like it? Hello. Is the Baron here? Mom went to the pharmacy. - Julius! Julius was a tiny tip-tip-tee, darling huggie bunny-ho. Are you still a bachelor, or maybe a confirmed one? And life has gone by like a dream... And a bullet may find him anywhere. It's so beautiful outside. You know, Helmi... Julius, wait! Will you stay as you are, so good. Helmi... Would you... Would you know where my puppet is? It's my guardian angel. Hello. Then, at last, the giant army is followed by a united nation, the people that have been so shattered. Oh, Papa! Sorry. I didn't want to disturb you. What is it? - It's time to go now. Go where? - The Fuhrer is calling. The historical homeland has always been there. What's the hurry now? It's in no hurry at all. But I think this self-established state here... They say that Estonia has been given away to Stalin. I'm not coming. My home is here! I think I should go. Perhaps you'll change your mind? Dresden's Semperoper, and... Farewell then... Helmi... Rannamaa. Father! Baggage inspection for immigrants to Germany With the last ship, in October, 800 more Estonian Germans leave. With this, the number of re-settlers in 1939 has risen to 12000. And as the Fuhrer has said, most of them will live in Poznan in Poland, newly divided between the Soviet Union and Germany. Helen? Back already? What would I know of these documents? Your passport, for example. You are his grandmother, right? It's very simple. A notary will come, you sign a power of attorney and that's it. Well, Julius, did you hear? The boy is selling the house. What's the hurry with this sale? If the price is right, then what's the problem? Where'd you get the key? Wait. You're the cinema-guy, right? I'd like to see the cinema, too. Damn. It's pitch black. We may end up having to bargain here. When was the last time a movie was shown here? 12. May '93. Terminator 2: Judgement Day. You can see that. But ok. You better make a Judgement Day for yourself, too. The buyer will be here soon. And the notary. It was a pleasure. But where will you put me? That's up to Paul. It's a time of change. Excuse me? - It's a time of change. Mankind is bidding farewell to its past. Well, the people have been rounded up there. Excuse me? Who rounded them up? - Sorry. It's all voluntary. Why does it smell of ?bourgeois? here? Listening to too much foreign radio? Little nationalist piece of shit. Put these on as soon as I finish. USSR and Estonia are becoming closer to each other. The Mutual Assistance Treaty of 1939 is inevitable. Clearly, the nationalist government cannot ensure Estonia's neutrality and peaceful development. The Baltic nations were eager to use the opportunity to show their free will and end the capitalist yoke forever by joining the friendly Soviet family. The Germans knew the Russians were coming. They say that dead bodies are being removed from this very police building. And the survivors are being sent directly to Siberia. Children, too. Everyone. What have they done wrong? Only under the fruitful conditions of Soviet rule, will the Estonian working class be heading towards a bright future. Applause to the working people of Soviet Estonia! What are you looking for? I want to know what the German radio is saying. You think you will hear something about Erik? Roosi, do you think that... What are you doing here? She's chasing her Erik! Obviously. Radios have been banned! Why? If they find one, you're finished. You know... What's that? This can only mean war. Helmi? - JUri! How sure are you about the people downstairs? They are our own people. - Own or not, when you're shitting your guts, you will sing. And you? - I thought they came for me. But I won't surrender. - Right. Who's chasing you? - Who? The NKVD, of course. And the bastards in our destruction battalions. How far is the front? Just behind Tartu. The Germans went towards Leningrad and we were surrounded. Here. This is Erik's old one. Do you know anything about Erik? Father promised to find him. You mean Old Willem? Your father? - Yes. JUri! What are you talking about? What is it with my father? What do I know? - JUri! Tell me what you know! Are you expecting someone? At night? Mother sent... - JUri! Step in. Well, the festive part is over. A red star on your forehead and a rifle in your hands? I didn't volunteer... - Yes. We'll be shooting at each other soon enough. I hid in the basement and all... Today they told my mother that if I don't show up by morning, they will shoot... Mother. Damn Hitlers! Liberated Latvia in two days but are letting us be wiped out. In the open, under a bush, an Estonian soldier is lying. On his face so beautiful a tear of death is glittering. Quiet! Julius, you too! In fact... You are... - I know, Julius. I don't want to go! Be brave. Here. You left the pot. See you after the war. I think I should hit the sack. No, you are not. You're going to tell me what you know about Erik. The bloody year of red terror is finally over. The blue-black-white tricolour flies all over Estonia again. People have come to the streets to greet their liberators the 61 st infantry and battle group Friedrich, Also including their own Estonian boys. The victims of the Bolshevist executioners are being honoured, people are looking for their lost relatives. Every dusk is followed by a new dawn and the people are eager to re-establish their normal lives. Helmi Rannamaa, an operetta singer of the Estonia theater, is not wasting any time. Long years separate her from Erich von Strandmann and now she has decided to travel to her loved one. But destiny is larger than life. There is no longer any point in looking for an address, as Erich has himself arrived home. Oh, what joy! Nothing can restrain this passion any more. But what's this? This is Erik's brand new leg. Don't take me as a complete cripple. When did this happen? But I wrote to you about that. I haven't heard about you in a very long time. Father wrote occasionally, but... Forgive me. But it was because of dad that I didn't write you. He lied that you are my brother. But I'm not! I know. JUri told me. Did he also tell you who my real father is? A stable boy of the manor. That's why Mamma went abroad in the first place. But once you knew, why didn't you come? I thought... I thought you wouldn't want me any more. Because of that new leg... - Silly you! You could be new all over, as long as your heart is the same! Battles don't cease during the holidays. But for the wounded frontline men, a Christmas mood is created using all means. For the Christmas season, the Estonia theater has staged a production of the beloved opera The Count of Luxembourg. How was the performance? It was more like a concert. Milvi Laid shone as always? - Yes. But I had a friend there as well... Is there any news from the front? They say that the Estonian boys have all been slaughtered near Velikije Luki. Roosi, these are just rumours. The boys will return and your Julius will be home by Christmas. Helmi... An old friend of yours came to see you. I let him in. Can't recall the name. Kirss, or something... and we're completely out of meat and vodka coupons. Roosi, everything's well. - Yes. Hello, Helmi. - Taavi! You here, like that. Almost from Lappland! Let me guess. Erich von Strandmann. Herr Hirsch, I presume. Father has told me about you. Dear children, Santa was only able to come to you because nazis fieldpatrol does not check Santa's papers. Well, will you sing or just recite a poem? The remainders of Mr Rosen's stock. Santa should go to other homes now, but... Tell us where you have been. I managed to escape from the camp in Jagala. Two months ago. No one can believe it. What camp? Here? In Estonia? 2000 people were slaughtered right away. Do you know about Doris and August? - Yes, I heard. So horrible! - What? August was our leading baritone. He sang mainly in Berlin and Vienna. What an irony. - What irony? He committed suicide together with his wife. Why?- Because Doris was Jewish. Why are you looking at me? Yes, I'm an officer of the German Navy. I have nothing to do with their damned Nazi party. Is that clear? I'll bring you something more comfortable to wear. Estonia: Territory and residents. Taavi... Does anyone else know you are here? Besides Roosi. I know what you are risking, Erik. They have complete lists. - You see, I'm on the list of those who went to Russia. Yes, but you didn't. I was a banker for von Rosen. It didn't suit me so well. Europe has done you good, Erik. You radiate modern values. I think that as soon as the war is over, I'll cross the ocean. I have relatives there. The movie business is big in America. Cinema has an amazing future. The Leningrad-Novgorod front is being firmly held by the Army Group Nord. Retreating is not an option. The front is just being reorganised to fortify the Narva river The Third Division of Estonian volunteers is being formed. They will hold the Narva river. Berlin has promised independence for Estonia. And Narva is the border of Europe and Russia, as was stated by... Can't you sleep? I took a vacation. Going away with Helmi? No, she doesn't know. If I were you, I'd go while you can. I will try, too. To the West, to the Allies. If, of course... A soldier's place is at the front. It's not your war. Yes. But it is my country. It is my home. Erik! Helmi! This evening of 9. March 1944 will forever remain in history as an example of the barbarism of the Bolshevist Stalinist regime. In two air raids, the heart of the capital of Estonia was destroyed. The symbol of Estonian culture, the Estonia theater is also in ruins. But Erik will be back! Then what? He will be glad you managed to flee with the child. What shall I do in Sweden? We're not going to stay there! We'll come back after the war. Trust me, the Allies won't sell us out to the Russians again. Everyone knows what they have done here. Going already? Are the Reds so close? They just entered the city. The German bastards have fled. Which flag shall I fly now? This? Or that? Fly all three, so all the bastards will be happy. Let's go. He's the spitting image of his father. Is he? - Like a living picture. Take him. Helmi, where are you going? We have one more family to pick up. The boat's not waiting. What shall I say to Erik? He won't come. The vehicle's papers are in order. Shit! They left. And JUri... It's the only picture of us together. Paul, what are we going to do about the cinema guy? Look, isn't this our crow? - Fuck you! Sorry, I wasn't talking to you. Our guest is arriving! Turn off the beat! It's not Russia, dork! Three very tough years... The yoke of the German conquerors has finally been broken. Tallinn, the capital of Estonian SSR is free at last. Once again, the red flag flies in the tower of Tall Hermann. Happy people are crowding on the streets in thousands, to greet the liberators with flower bouquets and dancing. Our own lads of the Estonian Rifle Corps. Arriving with the troops of the Leningrad front, Corporal Julius Naagu has come home. He immediately sets his steps towards someone dearly missed... Julius... You are alive! It doesn't feel like you're just back from the war. As they said at the front, only cannon flesh is Russian. Do you know what's going to happen now? Nothing. I fought on the right side. No one would dare touch us. Us. You mean...? We'll make ourselves comfortable here and... Most importantly, the worst is behind us. We'll put the boy to school. It is a boy? - Yes. Mihkel. Mihkel-boy... We'll hold a little party, too. I'll put on something fancier. Mother, I guess. She went to the market. What's the problem, comrades? Everything's alright here. I'm... Don't interrupt. We're working. You are Rannamaa, Helmi, daughter of Wilhelm? At the present, you are married to an officer of the army of the German Fascist conquerors, Erich von... Excuse me... It must be a mistake. Who are you? I'm a frontline man. 8th Estonian Rifle Corps, Corporal. Wounded at Velikiye Luki. You're shit, not a frontline man. Wilhelmina von Strandmann... Damn, that's hard to pronounce. By order of the government of the Soviet Union, you will be deported from the territory of the Estonian SSR to the far regions of the country. Any questions? No questions. Guys, would you relax for a minute. Let's get going, Pal- You, my little fascist-nazi. A beauty. Good... Hold Still! I'm sure they'll let us live here. The working class rules now, and we're so happy. Quit drinking. Don't waste the floor paint. Hello, Yulich. - Hello. How's it going? What are you showing today? What film? - About Siberia. About Siberia? That's good. Right, we'll see. Would you like some tea? Such a big apartment. Do you live here alone? - Well... It will soon become a military commissariat of the Lenin district. Quiet! Today, the 29th August 1949, at the Semipalatinsk Test Site, the first Soviet nuclear bomb was successfully tested. Guys, we have a nuclear bomb! To Comrade Stalin! Perish, international imperialism! Hooray, comrades! Aah, that's good! Get the ball rolling! A bomb for America! Look... How precise. - A hit on Moscow! Listen, we're on duty tomorrow. What are you talking about... Boys... It's 7.30 in Moscow. Good morning, comrades! Yes. Sidoroff, Nikolay Nikitich. Yes, a rifle, too. No, he is dead. I already checked. A seaman from Kronstadt. Everything's clear. He's a hero of the revolution. Yes. Right, I'll be waiting. They were interested. Here. Let's have one. You sure you don't know who killed him? I don't. Never seen him before. I swear! Who used to live here? A woman. - Where is she now? I don't know. To: Siberia, Tomsk, Helmi Rannamaa... What do you want? Ah, you... See, I'm back as promised. You wouldn't think - she's issue of 1908! We're going downstairs. What if she doesn't give us the passport? Power of attorney alone is useless. The hag has to come with us to the notary. The hag can't walk, you idiot. So what? - The notary must come here! Memorial Museum of Revolutionary Seaman S. I. Sidoroff, He was killed in an uneven fight with the bourgeois in this very building. There are bullet holes in that globe. Boys! Yes, please ask. But why was he killed? He was killed while defending the ideas of Lenin and Stalin of happiness for the working class of the world. They came on a few ships from Kronstadt. In the capital of the Czarist state, St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, workers, peasants and seamen had already seized power. What year is it now? 1954. - Very good. A Bolshevik was killed 37 years ago, but his memory lives on eternally. I'll do it. Go! Well, children. You can write, right? Of course they can! - And this is all thanks to heroes like this Sidoroff... Dear God. A feast. Just a moment... - You've changed. And... You haven't. - Yes. But the boy... What about him? Or...? - He was taken to an orphanage. Or so I was told. I looked for him, but his name had already changed. Oh... And you? You haven't married? No. Hasn't happened. Shall we have some tea? Or do you drink coffee here? Julius, sit down. Well, how's life? - Well... Surviving, somehow. Where's Roosi? She took to the drink. Couldn't quit till she was six feet under. So nice that you've kept this. Julius... It's as if I've always had you my whole life. You understand... I don't. All the way from Sverdlovsk to Tallinn I thought that if you are still here, then I'd marry you. Why didn't you write? I didn't write what? Not a single line. That wasn't forbidden, was it? God, did you... Even a few words. That you are alive. And I was... - You were what? Nothing. Julius, would you have answered me? Yes, I understand. An enemy of the people, after all. No. It's not that. I'll go then. - Where to? You know that people like me aren't allowed to live in their home region. Hello. You're Mr... Comrade Hirss? - Goodbye. Helmi... - Helmi? You are her friend, right? Hirss. And you are the... Comrade... Cinema man. Do you know where Helmi is now? In a collective farm. How is it going, dear guests? All's well, comrade farm chairman. Yulich... Yulich! Give me a glass. Oh, Yulich... - Has something happened? Our museum is screwed. In what sense? - Screwed. Incorporated in the Museum of Revolution. The hell With it... Wait! What's going to be here? Housing for the working class! How? - What? You're worried? You are safe! You're like in God's back chamber here! Who are you? A cinema man! What did Lenin say? Cinema is the most important of all arts! I have to rewind this. - Rewind! Light in Koordi. What's it about? There's this frontline man. Georg Ots. He's made chairman of a collective farm. That's how it should be! Good film. What? A colour film? Way to go! Look what's written here! - What? Americans want to be the first to fly to the moon! Earlier than us. - Seriously? See. The first man on the moon will be an American. Well, we're going to fly to Mars first! Mars is a bit far. We'll run out of gas. Be quiet there! OK, I'll wait there. What are you doing there? What? Fascists! Go away! Hockey? Why'd you turn that off? Who's playing? - Krylja vs Dinamo! Gulya, let's get married. - Get lost! Get lost! I see you every day... Good evening. Is Helmi Rannamaa living here? Wilhelm's daughter. Our people's enemy? Here. Yes, but she went to the attic, to hang laundry. Some time ago. Have you seen her? Ask Gulya. They're, like, friends. Captain 2nd rank, Yagodin, Matvey Sergeyevich. Collective farm... It's a particularly curious fact here in America that Hollywood is filming The Bridge at Remagen in Prague. When Soviet troops saw American tanks, they thought that NATO had captured the city. Helmi! The KGB is looking for you. Helmi Wilhelmovna Rannamaa? Mother? Why're you hanging around here? Do you need help? Quiet. He's in a bad way. Of course. He's been drinking for three days. Rookie. He has to get himself together or he'll die. What? He's just drinking! Don't shout! - Stupid... I don't understand what happened. He found out that seaman Sidoroff, the hero, raped his mother. Tried to rape her. - She told him herself. But why should that drive him to drink? She showed him a photograph. Of Sidoroff? - Of her own wedding picture. And? - He found out who his father is. Vodka! I'm sorry for Mikhail. Working in the system, yet his father was a German officer. He may even lose his job! His name is Mihkel. Americans made it to the moon before us, too. Gulya... Agnes! - Take this hound from hell! Our heirloom is freedom! Excuse me. Is Frau Wilhelmine von Strandmann... Rannamaa living here? Yes. - Would Frau be at home? No. Everyone is at the parade. Is Wilhelmine still singing opera? - No. She works at the opera's front desk now. Tell Frau Wilhelmine that von Stahl Jr was here. From West Germany. Come, Peter, we're going to see the old town and your birth house. One moment, darling. Damn, how beautiful. - Tchaikovsky. A great Russian composer. Yet you don't love the great Russian nation. Give this letter to Frau Wilhelmine. What a beautiful city! Take care. Why aren't you at the parade? What do you know about parades? But I have shed blood for peace. So let's drink to that, my dove. You are the woman who lived here a long time ago. During the bourgeois rule. Yulich has mentioned something... Let's drink! Why don't you love me? Fascist beauty. What do you want here? Nothing. I thought... You can only dream... Let's drink to the broad. With character. I like that! Let's drink! To the lady. - Don't touch me! I like that! What are you doing, bastard? It's my flower. Uncle Matvey has been killed! But you are going to prison now. What are you doing there? You hear me, thug? Don't start. Paul gave me permission. I'm going to call the police now. Stop hassling. Better help me look for it. Fuck it! Julius, what happened? Are you ok? It's not his house! It's our house, yours and mine. Let me show you something. - What? Before the mobsters kill me. North Tallinn Ambulance There are balconies. Civilisation! Or, as our wise Party says: life has to get better. I'll wave to you from there. Let's sit for a moment before going our own ways. Don't be sad. Your turn will come, eventually. Well... Farewell. Your ironing board... I forgot. Leena! What? - It doesn't fit in. The suitcase doesn't fit in. See? It'll fit! It doesn't. See for yourself! Bye! Yeah, well... I'm going, too. Thank you anyway for saving this place. Quite honestly... It'll all be torn down. There'll be an important breakthrough. Prospect of Communism. From the airport to the port. When will this be? Torn down? In the future. Next quinquennium maybe. Maybe six. We are going to the pharmacy as well. Do you want something? - No. Do you know that you are devilishly like your father. Even your son's position in the KGB won't help you here. Mihkel has left the KGB. Noone leaves the KGB by himself. He's working at a horse track now. In the stables. Like his grandfather. Erik's father. Well... Do you know anything about Erik? Well then, live as long as they let you. Hello. Mihkel! Uncle Jull! So how's life here? - Thank God, not bad. How's your mother... Helmi. Go up and see for yourself. Mihkel, come! - Right away! What? Go inside. I'll put the kettle on. It's so beautiful here. The communal life is gone. You've kept my room tidy. I didn't even recognise it at first. The biggest thanks to you for writing to me all these years. Where did you get this? Every other inmate is a supplier of something. Well, I'll... Julius, the most important thing had to remain unwritten anyway. Stop it. You saved my life. But what about you? Are you still alone? You know, at times I see Erik in my dreams. He has gotten so old. I think, if he's aging in my dreams, then he is not dead. What do you think? I saw Mihkel at the door. With some hairy chaps. He's preaching God's word in his spare time. In some church of... Methoditians or I don't know. Getting Gulya and the boy also to receive God's blessing. Sings his gospel every evening. But you haven't seen little Paul. He is also the spitting image of Erik. Oh, I'm just talking about myself all the time. Tell me about your life. Was it hard? - No. In jail, I became a cinema man, too. I wanted to give it to you earlier, but... But I couldn't. Gravely wounded Erich von Strandmann sank with the hospital-ship Moero, after being torpedoed by Russian vessels near Danzig. You are not angry with me for not giving it earlier? Oh, Julius... Well, you're just going to start showing cinema again. Yeah. There's no escape. It's my profession. Let's go to the cinema. What's on today? Some Estonian film. A Time to Live, a Time to Love. This summer of 1988 in Estonia is like one big singing revolution. One day we will win anyway! The leaders of the Estonian National Front have said that there will be big changes in the Soviet Union. A hero of the revolution, Nikolay Sergeyevich Sidoroff. Hello. We've come from the school named after him to visit the historical place. Look. But this museum has moved long ago. We know that. But we wanted to see the house where he fought and was killed. And we also wanted to bring some soil from his hometown. Here you go. - Look! That same globe! Yes! - Let's put the soil in the globe then. We also have a little act. Hello, perestroika, hi, democracy the dictatorship has fallen, everyone is glad. Hello, perestroika, hello many flags we are not afraid of this dirty old red flag. Is there any problem? - It's ok. Have you talked to your granny about the notary? - Sort of. You didn't dare? - She's your grandma. So? I can't force her, can I? Did they leave for good? Don't be silly! Berta from my theater found a treatment for Mihkel there. Maybe they can help fix him. And Gulya went with him only because Mihkel doesn't get around alone anymore. It must be quite expensive. - What? The treatment in Sweden. - Berta said that if one was forced to go to Chernobyl, then it's free. That a Swedish state institution will carry out the tests and treatment. Bleedin' Chernobyl. Listen, shall we have a little drink? What are we drinking to today? The future, of course. And for Mihkel getting well. And for Estonia to stay free. And not to get sold out again. You, old bachelor, are helping me to my bed? I have seen thousands of love movies. So I know how. Good night, old lady. - Good night. What's in there? A friend of Papa or his son found this box among his father's things. With a note that in this box, there is ash from the city of Dresden. Papa wished that his ashes would be returned to his homeland. And as he burnt up with Dresden in 1945, these ashes are pretty much... The old Baron's ashes? Alright then. I know where it belongs. Help me! The Estonia ferry crew is trying to contact Silja Europe. Is this soil? I'll throw it away. Papa's globe. Leave it there. I guess it's supposed to be there. There was a strong wind last night. I wonder if they got any sleep on that ship? "Shipwreck" Helmi... Take him to his hotel. Grandma, do you have your passport somewhere? You want to take it to a notary? No, the notary will come to you. I need you to give me your power of attorney. I heard you are planning to sell the house. Yeah... Wait. But look, we can buy this instead. Or something from there. Or... What do you think? I think you should let us die here. Then do what you please. You can't do anything here anymore. And they've paid an advance. You think I can't? But see, I can! And I can stop my home from being sold off just like that! This house is my life, Papa's life, Julius' life! You understand? Do you understand anything at all, boy? How much are they paying you? Can you at all imagine what has taken place in this house? How much suffering, worries, tears, hope and love there has been here? You think that if you just show me this glamorous picture I should gladly agree? Let's sell it to these thugs. No, Paul, this house will be turned into a children's music house. But on the other hand... Can I fight against the future? Of course I may not like your plans, dear Paul. But everyone has to make their own mistakes in life. That's the way life is. Thank you. Dear Helmi, as soon as I get your address, I will come to you. If they won't let you return to Estonia I'll come there. I don't know how to be without you. Damn! Now what? A mass suicide? A bloodclot in her lungs. If we had arrived earlier, it wouldn't have helped. At her age... She had an Agreement with the city. And now what? I don't know. I'll have to check. What do we do with the black guy? Mr. Lemmik, it just happened that... We'll find our own way out. My condolences. There is an ambulance outside. Helen, you see... Grandmother has left us... Old Mamma! Old Mamma is at home after all! You see, auntie Helmi, your little act almost had much graver consequences. Dear Helmi, where are you? I know you are alive there, somewhere. I have been searching for you, but Siberia is vast. All the letters are being sent back. Why don't you write me? That's not forbidden, is it?
