MY FATHER IS AN ENGINEER I'll tell you how it happened. It was December 24. Suddenly a fierce mistral began blowing, fierce enough to dehorn the Camargue bulls, uproot the olive trees of Crau or the pines of Alpilles. The mistral, God's good friend, had chased the clouds thousands of kilometres to clear the sky and make it bright with stars. The sky was sparkling clean. Fine work, but the temperature also dropped as a result. So the people of Bethlehem went to bed early. Joseph walked in front, his beard waving in the wind like a banner, trying to shield Mary from the wind with his broad carpenter's shoulders. From time to time he looked back and said... Are you all right, my love? I'm exhausted. One last effort, Mary, please. One last effort to that hangar over there. Nobody wants us. The rich don't want us. The rich chase us away. Only the poor live here. They'll make room for us. Hold me, it hurts. What misery! No money, no home, and my wife about to deliver! I'm sorry I cause so much trouble. No, Mary, I apologise for what I just said. I'm a miserable wretch. I don't deserve to be a father. Make your racket somewhere else! Beat it! Are you deaf, or what? Help us! Please! What the fuck do you want? I'm sorry. Please excuse us for waking you. - Why's she braying like a cow? - Like an ass. - Cow. - Ass... She's in labour. Come, quick. Lucky we put fresh straw down this morning. If we'd known you were coming, we'd have saved a few carrots. What now? Make her stand so the baby drops. - Come on, ox, lift her. - Shut up, you dumb ass! She's cold. "Indeed, that's exactly how it happened. "The ox and the ass got on their knees and warmed Mary. "They rubbed her limbs "and warmed her with their breath until midnight. "The baby was born at exactly midnight "without making a sound. "He smiled and his mother smiled. "Joseph, the ox and the ass shed tears the size of olives. "Then everyone smiled. "Miracles occurred, small and big..." Miracles, my arse! Miracles... There were no miracles and no Son of God! Must you read her this pious crap? It was her favourite story when she was little. - Think she can hear us? - I'm sure she can. Eat, my little dove. I hope she can hear us. But we can't know for sure. Not at all. Perhaps you're right. After all, if she smiles because she imagines an ass and an ox blowing on a baby, if she smiles, I'll believe in miracles. I'll believe anything you want. What's happening? It's past midnight. He won't come out. What do you mean he won't come out? Are you sure? So, old girl, things aren't too good? You no longer talk? You don't talk because you don't want to. I know you. Nothing and no one could ever shut you up. Only you can decide that. Does she eat? Only purees. Everything goes through the blender. Please, eat. Last time I saw you, you were less formal. Last time I saw you was on TV with the Health Minister. We're very proud of you. We didn't dare call you. You're an important person now. Would you like some more? No, thanks. Have you seen Professor Schidlowski? He was my teacher at uni. Did he mention psychological trauma? Yes... some kind of stupefaction. He explained that after a shock... What shock? There was no shock. When I found her she looked perfectly normal. They said the same at the hospital. - That's the thing, she looks fine. - I know... But her condition is similar to victims of terrorist attacks or other violent acts. They lose their will... Their will to live is completely gone. There's no more... meaning. In every sense of the word. - Can we do anything? - Wait. I'll stay a few days to study her file. Then I'll call a few specialists in Paris. Thanks, Jeremie. - So you've moved? - Yes. - We were robbed. - Several times. I even had my bag snatched. After that, I was constantly scared. I'd have liked to stay there. How do you fight fear? - Natasha took over our flat. - I'm not surprised. She set it up as her medical practice. We had more room there. Here we have one bedroom, there we had two. The conference ends on Thursday. So I'll be back Thursday evening or Friday morning. Anyway, I'll fetch her Friday evening for the weekend. My phone must have been switched off. I hate taking calls during a conference. I'll talk to the principal. Why shouldn't I talk to her? We have to sort out this situation. If she wants to quit school at 14... If school bores her, there must be a problem. No need to see a shrink. It didn't help last time. No, I don't agree. We'll discuss it when I'm back. Okay? Talk to you later. Take these... I should have thought about it but I didn't. Natasha's key. I'd rather stay in a hotel. And pay a fortune? Better stay at her place. Wearing blue helmets and carrying truncheons they are Basra's new police force. Accompanied by British troops, these policemen are now on the frontline. "Salam malekoum. Police! We want to speak to you." The tension is palpable. Then the door opens and the talking starts. "Is it true you entered this house without authorisation?" Another translator takes over. "A family arrived here two days ago "with a permit from the British. "You took advantage of this and moved in with them." A police officer moves forward. He directs the operation and wants it to be swift. He answers the old man's pleas with an abrupt order... Come in. "I give you five minutes..." Good evening, sir. May I turn down your bed? Policemen and soldiers enter the house and search it for weapons and loot. The head of the family still tries to plead their cause. To no avail. He and his children must leave, carrying their meagre possessions. In the garden, a woman is jubilant. She's the owner of the house. It's she who warned the British. They may be homeless, but it's her house. They couldn't stay there. I went up in the sky as high and as fast as I could to announce the good news. I blew my trumpet so hard I almost burst my cheeks! The mistral stopped. But it's not my trumpet that woke people up. Rather, it was the silence that followed. - She's not there. - I know. - Her office is closed. - I'm not here for that. - She's at her parents'. - You know her? We're neighbours. And you? I haven't seen you before. We fell in love in Russian language class in 1974. We were 14. You couldn't pronounce "My father is an engineer." Can you do it now? Impressive. How were we then? Do you remember? When I look at old photos, despite the images, I see us as we are today. Wouldn't you like to be on that cargo ship? No, I'm fine here. - How about travelling with me? - Where to? Alexandria, Valparaiso... I don't know. To be with you, yes. If a fairy appeared and asked you to make one single wish, what would it be? A house with a little garden, here, facing the sea. Is that all? And children... heaps of them. With me? I don't want to force the issue, but if you want... How many would you like? A house, kids... Such middle-class dreams. I am what I am, pal. And you don't care if beyond your little garden and house people starve and work themselves to death? I'll ask the fairy to give them houses with green shutters, to make sure they don't go hungry and aren't cold, and I'll ban work that kills. There is no fairy. We're the fairies, the workers of the world. Your fairy won't make the world free, without class or borders. Yes, but I wish for a house under the pine trees, on the hill where we made love for the first time. That's your right, just as it's my right to say yours is a petit bourgeois dream. - You're pulling my leg. - A little. So you found her on Tuesday? Yes, I usually visit her on Tuesdays. It's on my way. Every Tuesday I go to the gym. So on that particular Tuesday I came and I pushed the door, which she leaves open, knowing I'm coming. Natasha? It's me. Everything seemed perfectly normal. She was at her desk. What are you doing there? I can't smell coffee. Have you forgotten? Are you busy? Shall I make it? Natasha? What's wrong? Natasha! Do you hear me? Natasha! My girl... You used to pinch my lavender. There... You'll be beautiful. "The dinner was at its end. "Jesus stood up, tense and solemn, "and performed a new and surprising ritual. "He took bread, blessed and broke it, "and gave it to his apostles. "'Take, eat, this is my body. Drink from this all of you, "'for this is my blood of the new covenant, "'which is shed for many for the remission of sins.'" Do I ask or do you? Last year? You. Then ask. Do we go on, or stop? We go on. Do we stop or go on? We go on. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Yes, Brigitte, I'm listening. I don't know about that. Yes, I spoke to Jacques. True, I did tell him that. Since he told you everything, no point repeating it. I'm fine, but I don't feel like talking to anyone. - Is she here? - No. - My wife said get the doctor. - She's not here. She said get the kid doctor. - What's wrong? - Sick. - Who is? - In my home. - I'm a doctor. - Good! Let's go. - Natasha not here? - No. - I thought she was back. - Not yet. Will you see her? She'll be very pleased. Bye. Are you good at French? "Chanter" is in the first group. But "aller" isn't. But it ends with "er". Yes, but that's how it is. You say je chante bien, but je vais mal. Or je chante mal, but je vais bien. Usually there's a baby. Yes... usually these two have a baby. On the dot of midnight. But my dad doesn't believe it. Like Santa? Yes. But my mum really believes in it. So every year, we put up a crib to please her. And to please my dad, we omit baby Jesus. It was a secular crib. I'm like my dad. But I do love the story. That everyone gets together once a year, on that day, everybody together, all the people, the villagers, the mayor, the knife-grinder, the gendarme, the thief, Roustido the rich man, Vincent the poor, the fisherman... All agreeing! Agreeing to what? Simply to living together. Care for some coffee, or does it keep you awake? A drink? My kids have left home. They're twins. A boy and a girl of 22. They've gone abroad to work. London, Barcelona... Foreigners flock here, the French leave... I don't get it. They have guts. But I miss them. I was there when her father found her. I heard the ambulance. I saw her lying on a stretcher. We used to have so much fun, Natasha and I. She was fun, wasn't she? She was quite a girl. She was only worried about the girl. What girl? She lives here. It started when she was 13. She visited Natasha since she was little. - It started when she was 13... - What started? - The problems. The girl... - What's her name? Didn't I tell you? Mylene. Like the singer. Her parents weren't too thrilled about her seeing that boy. And the boy's parents weren't happy either. But they seemed to really love each other. I called them Romeo and Juliet. - Why tell me all this? - I don't know. Natasha couldn't get it off her mind. But Vadino, Mylene's dad, is a decent guy. Natasha is right. We can't just do nothing. We must listen to no one. We must say no, no, no! That's fine, but what do we do? We explain to everyone that it doesn't have to happen. We'll split into blocks, entrances and floors. We won't forget anyone. We'll knock at every door. It's important to explain it to people with poor French. We'll take as long as we need. If we believe in ourselves, they'll believe us. They'll see we're all in the same boat. We must resist every eviction, whoever they may target! We must take the time to convince people. We're all different, with different religions, but we must bury our differences. Today, the choice is simple. We stick by each other or we're finished. This applies to housing, but it also applies to all other issues. We'll win. - I'm a communist, I'm love from toe to head. "Love: see, think, understand. "Love: a child is born, light advances. "Love: to hang a swing on the stars. "Love: quench steel with infinite pain. "I'm a communist, I'm love from toe to head. "I translated the poem into Russian "for Anoushka and Maroussia. "Ismail lights his cigarette from mine. "He says it's a nice poem and gets up to open the window, "letting the sun in. "'Life is beautiful, my friend' he says." LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL, MY FRIEND Nazim Hikmet I'm sure your presence makes her feel better. Thank you. All these years you were happy. I know, your neighbour told me. She tells me everything. I don't even know her name. Me, I was unhappy. All the time. Death... Death, death, death... The places I visited during those years were full of death. Corpses, like those you watch on TV. I mean, those you watch without seeing. And the smell. The smell... It forces you to see them. I was thinking about you. Your smile. Your laughter, your body. But also your hands. Your hands had become an obsession. Your hands that hold babies. I imagined them white. Whiter than in reality. As white as the babies' skin. Remember what Rene Char wrote? "Man is capable of doing what he's incapable of imagining." Well, that's what I saw. What man is capable of doing. It's rather nice that you don't talk. I can finally get a word in. And you not answering removes all inhibitions. You've always impressed me. Always on top of everything. That's quite something. I shouldn't have accepted that we stop. I didn't want to. I love you. You're my only love. And I will only ever love you. But you must speak, Natasha. You must speak. Hi, Annelise. You're ready? Yes. You're in good hands. Yes, but the professor is asking for money... to make sure it's he who operates. Wait, did I get that right? He asked you for money to perform the operation? 10,000 francs. That's all right, Natasha. Come in. I have a fascinating case for you. I'm afraid we're fascinated by different things. Is this spine fascinating you? What about the man? Know why his spine is like that? Do you know why it's wrecked? Because since he was ten he's been maintaining the ships that took your father and his cronies on exotic cruises. Don't! Alexandria, Valparaiso, your dreams of travel, will you finance them with workers' pensions? Natasha! Coffee keeps me awake. Stay with me. No. But you're drunk. No. Come on, stay. No. You prefer Natasha's bed. It's bigger than mine, right? Her TV is bigger too. And the wine's better too. Is that it? Get up, go to bed. If I get up I'll move and I'll vomit. I'm staying put, I'm not moving. Come on, stay. It's Tuesday. I bet you haven't had lunch. I never told her, but her coffee was vile. Those electric contraptions are rubbish. The coffee tastes like shit, even the colour's wrong. You haven't eaten anything. I'm fine. Want to come to Mejean with me? Did you know she had a shack there? No. No one's been there since she... We should go and check. Did you have other plans? No. Let's go, then. Why did you call her Natasha? Because it's Russian. And I liked the Russians at that time. I mean, the Soviet Union. But don't you know what it means? What? It means something? It means Natale, nativity day. Really? And Jeremy, in Hebrew, means grown, elevated towards God. Are you Jewish? No more than Natasha is Russian. My parents were true communists like you. Resistance and all... Do you know the date of St Jeremy's Day? - No idea. - It's May Day. Do we stop or do we go on? We stop. I don't want to leave this place... my town, my neighbourhood. You... You do what you must. Do it well. But I... If I aim too big, I'm afraid of missing the target. In this town, in this neighbourhood, I have my reference points. You know I don't like the open sea. And this way, there are less risks of getting lost. So I'll open my medical practice and treat people I've known since I was born. It's not very ambitious, but I won't be the first to suffer from lack of ambition. Besides, when I think about what I want to do, I actually think that it's rather grand. It takes as much courage to leave as it does to stay. That's true. May I have some champagne? We've won a great victory! What did we achieve? Well, we've won, of course. No one will be evicted! But... we've done better than that. Much better. We've put aside our petty grudges. We've put them aside to focus on what matters, the fact that there are no reasons why we shouldn't get on, and if there are, they're bad ones. I hope this makes sense, because I've had too much to drink. But... if we try to put intellect and love ahead of everything else, there's no reason why the world shouldn't improve! There were too many miracles that night to count them all. God may like to please, but he doesn't like it advertised. As for the good news and lovely music, one person in Bethlehem was unmoved. That was mean Roustido. The scriptures spare him by not mentioning it, but he expelled St Joseph and the Virgin, shouting... Beggars! Bums! Go away! Yet his daughter Mireille was the prettiest, kindest, daintiest and most amiable of girls. She was modest and patient but she was in love with Vincent. When she mentioned him to Roustido he almost choked to death. It's not even locked. What did I say? She left everything as it was. The butter's still good. Coffee... Still hot! What are you doing in my daughter's place? Out! Wait... Out! - Mylene? - Yes. You know her? She's fine. She's eating, putting on weight, sleeping, crying... - So I came for nothing? - Isn't it better that way? What do I owe you? We'll see next time. Let me do the paperwork. Natasha... Hi, Rachid. Wait your turn. She's not going to school. He's locked her in. They don't want me to see her. Excuse me. School is compulsory. You can't stop her attending. You can't imprison her forever. Let's solve this. I'm happy to help. Help? We don't need help! Why stick your nose everywhere? You're just a doctor. Leave us alone. If you separate them, one won't survive, maybe both. Do you want that? I knew her as a baby. She's like a daughter to me. She's not your daughter. You have no children. Let me raise mine as I wish. I know what to do. I'll walk you home. - Nice day, isn't it? - Yes. I'll tell you this... At 14, I was in love. In fact, I still love him. I never stopped loving him. I don't know where he is. With his family, wife, daughter... probably. Or on a mission somewhere, far away. Yes... Far away. And if your girl loves that boy the way I loved him, nothing can separate them. She may not marry him, she may not live with him, but he'll always be with her, she'll always miss him. So, whether she marries him or not, she'll always blame you for trying to separate them. And you'll have lost your child. Nonsense. I was in love at 14, but I don't miss him. I don't even remember his name. No one asked you to come. I know what to do. Go home. May I? - What do you want? - To come in. Are you alone? - Why? You want to talk? - Just let me in. You don't want to. Will you keep her locked up for long? We'll move her to another school. To stop them seeing each other? I don't want her to ruin her life. She's not studying. I want her to have a real job, a real life. A clean and noble profession like yours. People respect you. You can afford nice things, you're well-spoken. School's no big deal. She can repeat a year. She likes you, she's known you since she was born. Please, tell her she can marry at 20. I mean, no one marries these days. Anyway, she needs my signature and she won't get it. You'll make them suffer for nothing? She's not marrying an Arab. What? You heard me. They're in love! They grew up together. I looked after them. We fought for the same things. We all live here, including Rachid's family. - Are you racist? - No, you're not like me. You chose to live here. I didn't. I was forced to. I never chose anything. But for her, I will choose. You can go. My father was an immigrant, a shitty dago. But he respected the country that gave him work. That's why he became French, out of respect. And thanks to him, I'm French too. Even if I have to do shitty work. I may do shitty work till I die, but I'll always have one thing, the fact that I'm French. That's all I have. And that's all I can give my kids. I don't want to give that away. "'Never! Do you hear me? "'I will never give my daughter to a poor man!' "Mireille tried day after day to change her father's mind, "but the old man was as stubborn as a Corsican ass. "So one night..." - Shall we elope? - Yes. - It's a sin. - God will forgive us. "I love you, I'll die for you! "Don't say that! "I want what you want. "I'll fetch the horse and we'll ride to Vaccares. Natasha! We said one hour. - We lost track of time. - Of course. Quick, hop in or your parents will notice you've been out. They didn't have a clue. It went on for two months. We met almost every week. Thanks to Natasha. I'll tell you what happened after. It was the day of my baby brother's baptism. You could have come to help. Already dressed? What's wrong? What happened? Tell me. Where's Rachid? I don't know. I'm pregnant. What did you say? I'm pregnant. I'll take you home. I don't want to go home. He'll hit me again. - Who hit you? - My father. With a baby, they can't stop us marrying. So you're having a baby to force your parents? Mine too. They want me to marry a Kabyl. - How far along? - Two and a half months. Was that when Natasha put you up here? First we went to the hospital to check on the baby. Everyone knew her there. They checked me. The baby was fine. The next day she went to get Rachid. - We've been here ever since. - A fisherman brings us fish. Know what happened to Natasha? No, we don't know anything. She doesn't talk. I came, but she wouldn't talk. She has to be fed, dressed, washed. She looks so sad. She's retreated into herself. Will she recover? Yes... She certainly will. It's a condition one recovers from. But we can't tell when. I'm calling from a church. Did I tell you I was going to Armenia? I'm in Erevan, in a place just like our housing estates, dilapidated for no doubt similar reasons. And there, with buildings built all around it, probably to hide it because they daren't destroy it, is a church. You'd love it. It's tiny, only a few metres in diameter, so tiny you could probably fit it in one of your cribs. Shit, you're gone. I'd have loved to talk to you. I'm tired. I thought if people were naked, without uniforms, if they forgot their history and that of their parents and grandparents, perhaps they'd stop fighting. Perhaps the Azeri wouldn't have killed Armenians in Sumgait. The Karabakh war wouldn't have happened. I know you're not there, but I speak to you anyway. I love you. I miss you, my little girl. Hi, Jacques. I won't go. No, I'm not sick. Yes, I'm in Marseille but I won't go to the congress. Because it's pointless. Year after year, thousands of talks, meetings, conferences, publications... AIDS in Africa, the International Conference in Brussels in 1995, Arusha in 88, Lusaka in 99, Ouagadougou in 2001... For what? To tell them they won't get generic drugs and they'll all die, while the CEOs of the three pharmaceutical giants meet in secret to decide how the world should be treated. Yes, I know you know all this. In fact, everyone does. Anyway, what can we do about the fucking CEOs? Issue fines, warnings, reprimands, that's all we can do. I've had enough of empty gestures. I can't hear. You're dropping out... I tried something new. It's a bit like an old form of torture, but sometimes it works. No one can really say why. - And did it work? - No. No, no result. She's still in her own world. Let's have another one, as you say. Hi, Natasha! A drink? - What are you doing here? - It's the kid's baptism! Ah, the great Christian community. - Love thy neighbour... - What do you want? God isn't a free gift, you must deserve Him. It's like being a father. You must deserve that right. A father loves his children above all else, protects his children. She almost lost the baby, but it's fine. You should have hit harder. You stuffed up. She won't press charges, because kids love their parents. But I will. I'm sick of people who drag the world backwards to preserve their pathetic little lives, their peace and quiet. They have nothing, but no one should dare disturb the nothing, the void, the hole in which they live their petty, selfish lives. The world stops at their door, and once it's closed no one moves, no disturbances, no rocking the boat, no taking sides. Why don't you say something? Give me one argument. Speak up, you're a mother. So you've become nothing. Beneath contempt, inhuman. You disgust me. You can't sleep? Is it because of Mylene? Why don't you go to the police? - I'm watching that guy. - What guy? - Near my car. - Is he a thief? No, I think it's the guy who moved into her place. I cooked you lamb with white beans. I had a hard time finding fresh ones. You'll love it! You're not in top form. Can we help? No. It's this story... Romeo and Juliet. - Vadino's daughter? - Yes. I'm sick of dealing with all that crap. All that nastiness and hatred. I can't take it any more. I don't know, it's... I can feel it in my body, it's physical. I'm worn out, I feel like something will explode. It's 2003. We're in France. This shouldn't exist. What shouldn't exist, love? He beat his daughter. She's pregnant and he hit her. - How old is she? - 14. A bit young for babies, but that's no reason to hit her. - I don't know what to do. - Don't do anything. I'm proud of you. What should I do? You can't save them all. Think about yourself a bit. Have you read How Green Was My Valley? No. It's a novel. The author tells the story of his family, his story. They're miners, from father to son. At the end, he can't open the shutters of his window. He was born there. When he was little, he could see the fields from his window. But now, even if the mines are closing down, even if there are no jobs, the coal waste heap is so huge that it threatens the house. Those warehouses opposite, they reminded me of it. Good evening. Nice of you to drop by. Will you come in? I can't offer much, but we can have a drink. I'll see what I can find. Would it help to know exactly what happened? Would it help her to know what happened? It could. I caused it. I've only got Curacao. Is that okay? Did you hear what I said? Yes. So? Curacao? She's my daughter. Where is she? I've hidden her. Where? First I'll ask you something. Is being of the Left only a declaration of intent or something you practise in your everyday life, with your wife, children, neighbours? Okay, never mind. Think I came here to talk? No, we're not going to talk. All you do is talk. We don't want to hear you! What will you do? Hit me? Like your daughter? Hit me where? On the mouth? The belly? Everywhere? No, we're not going to talk. When did it happen? A month ago. The day after my baby's baptism. On Sunday. What are you going to do? I don't know. And you? Good evening. I just woke up. It's 6 a.m. here. Where are you now? Pakistan? Afghanistan? Vietnam? I'd like to have a phone number so I could call you. I hate leaving messages that you'll play who knows when. I dreamed about you. You were inside me. We weren't making love, we were one body. It was lovely, warm, peaceful, serene... There, my Jeremy. I wanted to tell you this before I forgot. I love you. See you soon. I'm not in a hotel. I'm at Natasha's. She can call me any time she wants. It's not the same... Because she's my daughter. In a hotel or at Natasha's, she can call me on my mobile. Is she there? Tell her to call me tomorrow. Okay? I love you too. Is she better? Natasha, is she better? No. Will you stay at her place? What's that great love story of hers? She always spoke about the guy she fell in love with at school. She still loves you. Do you know that? Yes. And you? Still seeking adventure? What's your thing? Doctors Without Borders? No. Anyway, it's all the same. You came back because you love her, right? I don't know. Did you know that... Mylene’s father and her... Go on. They were lovers. Why are you telling me this? He wasn't the only one. I could tell you a few stories. So? Nothing. She lectured everyone. But it didn't stop her screwing married guys like Vadino. You didn't know that, did you? Hello. Is your husband here? Yes. She interrupted the baptism in front of friends and family. I couldn't sleep that night. My wife was crying silently. I'm not saying we were right... Do what you want, say what you want. To your children, to your wife, to the cops. Kiss, fight... Natasha can no longer do anything for you. And I don't want to do anything for you. It's your responsibility. Entirely yours. Hello? On a road, I'm walking, it's a nice day... No, I'm not back yet. I don't know. Not straight away. I said I'm walking on a road, it's a nice day, I can see the sea. I'll tell you what's happening. I'm giving up. I'm giving up politics. Because politics is now divorced from reality and ideals. Because whenever we act... Of course, I speak for those who act, not for those who do nothing, they're even worse. But those of us who believe they're acting, who think they're fighting, face an insurmountable wall called realism. Not reality but realism. You must respect opinions feelings, sensitivities, priorities... No one takes positions on principle, there are no idealistic, radical positions. Are you going to Marseille? Can you take me? Yes, I'm hitch-hiking. When I'm settled she can visit me on weekends. I'll see her just as often because I won't be travelling. Kiss her for me. I love you. Thanks. I've made a decision. Your folks won't see me on TV any more. I'm quitting my position at the Health Ministry. I'm resigning. I've mailed the letter. I knew you were right not wanting to leave. It wasn't people I wanted to save, it was humanity. Saving people wasn't enough. I wanted greater powers. Let those born to power stick with it. It's their thing, they're comfortable with it. The rest of us are made to be in opposition. Always. Viscerally. We belong to that "ordinary" France. Only you can understand what I'm saying. We're the same, you and I. "I'll tell you how it happened. "It was December 24. Suddenly a fierce mistral began blowing, "fierce enough to dehorn the Camargue bulls, "uproot the olive trees of Crau or the pines of Alpilles. "The mistral, God's good friend, "had chased the clouds thousands of kilometres "to clear the sky and make it bright with stars. "The sky was sparkling clean." I'm a murderer. I'm a murderer. I showed them the door, calling them beggars and bums. I threw them out into the street. I'll never forgive myself. I'm a criminal. I'll order a comfortable covered carriage. It'll take you to the house. You'll have the best, warmest room, my room. You can stay as long as you want. Till your last days, if you wish. You won't have to worry about anything. - You're very kind. - Don't go to so much trouble. What am I to do with all this kindness in my heart, alone in this empty house? Come... I don't want to see him. He'll never marry my daughter. Why not? He's young and handsome. Stay out of my family business. What happened to your kindness? I can't do this. I can't give my daughter... to a fife player. Where's your baby? It's not born yet. But I'm fine! You're right, Joseph. Take her home. Come on... All of you come and receive the good news! Come, everyone! Come and welcome the good news! Come on, everyone, let's welcome the good news! Come and wait! Is she cured? Get in. Thanks, but we'll take the stairs. What do we do? Do we stop? Do we carry on? Don't worry, we'll carry on. We'll carry on. We carry on. Subtitles: Burmanx for KG
