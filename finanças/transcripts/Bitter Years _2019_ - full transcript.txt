Illegible handwriting. Coletti! How was the essay topic? "The story of my life", teacher. Precisely. Story of my life. Which is a way to get to know better each other. Considering your young age... I couldn't expect very long essays. But one of them, In particular... Impressed me, also for its brevity. Next time leave more space for corrections. Can you be so kind to read your essay aloud for the class? I was born in Milan. May 21, 1952, My zodiacal sign is between Taurus and Gemini while my ascendant is Sagittarius. My father Walter is an industrialist who trades silk. His Jewish roots bring us back to the Nile, and the ancient Alexandria of Egypt. My mother Liderica is the daughter of musicians. I am the penultimate of seven brothers, the oldest brother is Giulio, who works in family business. And the youngest is Paola, the closest to me by age. Instead I... My name is Mario. Or if you prefer: Maria. Thank you! Well, I'll see you on Tuesday. Please put the essays here on the desk. Thank you. Have a good day. See you. See you... Thank you. Thank you. See you. See you. I'm not convinced... They still seem so young. You have a third grade, but me... It's delicate to talk about the massacre... Of course! Students asked me to talk. Really? Good morning! A glass of water, please. Hi, Aldo. A coffee. With a little warm milk separately. Hi, girls! You too in skirt... Yeah, pants are so uncomfortable, and are so fashionable... With a nice skirt, however, if you need urgently you lift your skirt, you bow and it's done! Do you agree? The usual. Thanks. But you are so dark... A color note is missing. Maybe here. Or here... Maybe here! Always joking, you! I wasn't joking! July 1970. The implacable joy of every everlasting sunset and the lashing ecstasy of the statues that surround me, harder more serious than ever to continue to die. Impudent of the circumnavigating matter cooled of being. And powerless. Even to get rid of the last dust that human organization would raise with a breath... ...all this concerns me when I think that men, after the path of thirty years, renounce the triduum of love for the boredom of another hundred. I am Stephen Dedalus! That's why I insist so much on Joyce. We all, all are Stephen Dedalus! It is the paradigm of the young rebel poet. It's what we are In this society. Of so old and rotten rules. You Marxists don't understand shit! Poetry is nothing but the voice of our solitude. It's an urgency. A different point of view on things. It is the thirst for truth mentioned by Nietzsche. The very fact of writing verses is a rebellion against a normality that is expressed in prose. Don't you think so, Carlo? The true rebellion is another: it is my body that becomes poetry. It is not necessary to write poetry to be rebellious. Just be. Just be divine! I believe in the movement and in joy. Vivre la joie! Three! Have you ever tasted the Wunderbar Cocktail? Come on, try it! Oh, this sends you into orbit like Apollo 13! LSD. It's a cocktail with LSD. Yes. But... It doesn't make me feel any effect! No! Nothing really! Vive la liberté! I want to be free! Friends, companions... free! I am everything and everyone. Do you understand, my friend? What are you saying? Ave Maria... Yeah. Amen. So? Let's eat? Good morning. Good morning, Dr. Mieli! Wait! Here is today's mail. Ah. Bills, en? Maybe yes. Thank you. Hi, Dino. How's your gout? God, what ugly dark circles! It would take a concealer. You always want to joke... Sorry, we are late. You did well net to wait. You upset Miss Fumagalli this morning, eh? Everything under control, dad. I solved it in time. She was annoyed... But she didn't say anything. I don't contradict my son in the company. She was wrong and I pointed it out to her. Come on: she was about to send the orders of the silkworms to the designer, and confirmation of the commission to the Turks. Imagine the designer looking for silkworms to send us. "The Silk worm spins a bad cocoon". It's Jules Renard! Nothing... Eh, I'm growing old... The company is in your hands, by now. But I trust with my eyes closed. You have taught me everything. Yes, don't worry, dad. The Como silk tradition. is in good hands. Excuse me. Oh, finally, Asmara! I'm hungry. I have to go. I must meet Monica. We're going to study in the library and then I will stay a while at her place. Don't be late. Bye auntie! Bye Nefertiti, have fun! You should not wear jewelry. They are a gift from auntie. Well, at least not here with us. All right, forget the aunt's jewels. What are you going to do after high school, Mario? Philosophy. Well, I think it fits my spirit. The meaning of "anima", spirit in Latin, is wind. Did you know, dad? Well, you deal with yarns... I deal with philosophers. After all, it takes all kinds. It was the favorite proverb of Wittgenstein, great philosopher, you know? Well, do as you wish. But if you go on with those harlequinades... You will have us on your conscience. Class consciousness. Okay, did you decide where you are going on vacation? Will you come with us? To Lora or Montecarlo? You really like staying with aunts. I would like to go to London. I just. Italian but born in Egypt. Are you Egyptian? Yup. Me too! Only my origins. I'm from Milan. My father was born in Alexandria, Egypt. I'm Mario. Sorry. Piero. In short, you're a painter. I studied architecture in Cairo, then I came here. Everything is experimental, here. I learn new techniques with tempera. You know, London is a great inspiration for me. Almost as much as the Italian Renaissance. But it's not only this. There are the movement meetings the radical Left, the rallies... Yes, I see. They leave the mark too. The point Is: here you can breathe an air of great changes that are about to explode. And It's about everybody: workers, students, women, blacks, Indians, homosexuals... Here as in America, as in France. That's why I came to London. It seems like being on another planet. So... welcome, Major Tom! Don't tell me you don't know "Space Oddity". David Bowie? Got it. Got it... I'll have to let you know a few things. You will go crazy fer David Bowie! I already know. Ok, great! See you in Sanremo. Finally! But is it possible that you are always on the phone? So, I just heard that in Italy there is a guy, Angelo who is organizing the first rally of homosexuals. Are you coming? I can't. I have too much to do here. Come on, it's in Sanremo! There is the sun, the sea, the flowers... Moreover, It's near France. I would but... And you, Shadi? Do you want to come with me to Italy? Italy? Let's go to Italy! Wonderful! I go and come back. I come back. For you we are only deviants! You want to torture us, lobotomize us... Fix us like machines. Or heal us with a prostitute. Hello doctor! You want me to do the electroshock? Mario? Angelo! Finally we know each other in person. What a pleasure! Ruggero... Nice to meet you. Alfredo... Nice to meet you. Françoise d'Eaubonne... Enchanté! He is Mario Mieli. Ah, she is Shadi, my English friend. "The awakening of homosexuals has begun". "It happened to many others before us, Jews. Blacks!” Beautiful words for our first time in public. Did you memorize them? Sure. I'm not black, but I'm a homosexual and a Jew. Antisemitism and hatred for homosexuals have much in common. I know that you study a lot. I'm just a bookseller. Look, now that you're back in Italy you must be with us. You must be part of the F.U.O.R.I. which means Italian Revolutionary Homosexual Unitary Front. Brave, I see you've studied.. Did you see? Françoise, bien arrivée. Merci Angelo. Vous êtes ardents. Bien, alors, on y va. But... is she the singer? No, dummy! She is not Françoise Hardy. She is Françoise d'Eaubonne, the feminist. She founded the French revolutionary movement, for lesbian and homosexual rights. Did you understand? It's an historic day! April 5, 1972, revolutionary fags in Sanremo defeat bourgeois doctors, sexologists and psychonazists who want them all in an asylum. Or chaste, which is worse! [speaking in French] We protest against your sexophobia. And you won't stop us, because your values have no scientific basis. I want to tell you something. I'm a homosexual and I'm proud of it. You are hiding behind the role of doctors and scientists. To impose a norm, your norm. Homosexuality is a disease for you, and we are the sick. But we no longer want to be victims. Homosexuality, heterosexuality are just labels. And you, with your repression, are accomplices to the worst neuroses. We are what you have under your eyes. And that you refuse to see. We are not sick. We are happy! You better call the police. You never know with these people. Some stink for you! Get out! Get out! Rotten eggs and sulfur, the stench of the devil! Few weeks ago, In April, in Sanremo, an international congress of sexology was held, the first one in Italy to discuss on a scientific level. What the congress agenda. Defined the deviant behavior of sexuality. But just to challenge the term "deviant" also dozens of adherents to various leagues of homosexuals came from all over Italy and the world to Sanremo. The slogan of those leagues in English is Come out. Listen, it seems clear to me. That they don't want to let us come out from the ghetto of public toilets. They are killing us with their raids. They humiliate us, they file us down. We have to say it, shout it, if it is necessary. Yes sure. But explain me why one who has a wife and children and at night goes cruising in Parco Sempione gardens why he should shout to everybody that he is a fag. He only has to lose. You are right. There is a long way to go. But here there is also something else. The right of women, for example. Their struggle is ours too. There is a whole system that needs to be overturned, put in crisis. Guys, let's look at America. The example is that. They started small and now they are getting stronger. The feminist movement, the blacks one: there is no other way. I mean, let's just think about the pride they showed in New York after yet another eruption of the police in that bar... what's the name? Stonewall. Yes. It seems obvious to me that everything starts from our Marxist conscience, right?? Of course, this is not just about homosexuals. The Personal is Political, Angelo. We have already discussed this. Fernanda is right, sexual liberation is a political act. And the women's movement is symmetric to ours. Marc, what do you think? I think you're right. Women are beginning to look for themselves. To oppose models of behavior imposed by society, by the family. And they can do it only with a message of breakdown, combined with that of the homosexual movement, of course. It's time to free us! Everybody, men and women. Is it an utopia, a dream? I don't believe so. Well then... Can I take you home? I have my car here. Wherever you live, I gladly take you. So let me know... Not only are you an architect, a teacher, an artist, but also a taxi driver. And very gallant. "Your wings..." "Your wings have a thrill of a butterfly in the sun". "The beautiful head, in the shade" "is all bathed in burning tears". "Hands just touch the great holy shoulders". Do you know this poem? De Pisis. Painter, poet, writer. Just stop teaching. Tell me about you. What's a husband and a father doing in a homosexual meeting? And I also have two sons, yes. The family is a bourgeois institution, the most false. Don't you think? Actually, I'm leaving everything behind. It's not easy. So let's get the bird out of the cage. And if he dies? The sky is big, my friend. I believe I will take the risk. Faggot! Do you want to deny the people's voice? What is faggot? What is a straight? The world will live in peace and harmony only when we will stop with these distinctions! Dear Corrado, here it is just as we thought, there is an air of revolution. Gay Liberation Front is fighting alongside feminists. After centuries of silence, all our talk. About capitalist society and sexual repression are coming to life. Here too the comrades dress up, you should see them. Well, if women wear trousers. Why should we give up a pretty little skirt? I found some beautiful ones here. Ah, the day when heterosexuals will recognize their "feminine side" we will celebrate the end of the roles. I believe it. If he believes... We are male and female. Not male "or" female. Freedom in a conjunction. Nobody who gives us a lecture, or timetables, rules, money. I can even study for exams, It is the enthusiasm, maybe... Do you remember the poems of Sappho. We read together? Love is the key to everything. We are freeing Eros from taboos. Hooray! Yours, Maria. Piero, here I feel at home. Amidst the sarcophagi? My ancestors come from Egypt. I know I know. You've already told me at least twenty times. For that matter, I was born in Egypt. But in my veins flows Pharaoh's blood. So it was destiny that we would meet. I'm happy. It's nice to kiss in front of the mummy. Maybe he too, as a youth, was a gay communist. Of course, sir. We were already fed up. I should have reacted, give him a punch. Listen to me, dear. Above all, two things are important in life. The "savoir faire" and the pearls. You must give me happiness. You must give it to everybody. Always books, books even as a child. They are the best medicine, right? Aren't you tired? Is it not better If you sleep a little? I'm making up an exam. That's okay. So a coffee? How did it go? As usual. 30 cum laude. I really do not know how you can find the time to study. Uh, that's the easiest part. It's the rest that... Honey, you're here too! Hi dear, how are you? Do you know each other? Yes, last year, in Sanremo, at the rally. And we, where we met? I have amnesia. What amnesia! Time runs too fast for you. Life is short, mon ami. And then a meeting is worth only its intensity. Do you stop making philosophy, the two of you? Didn't you say you had a commitment? Damn, yes! What time is it? It's late, I have to go. I was glad to see you again. Moi aussi. It means "Me too", honey. Ah, okay. Who understands you! We'll see you later, right? See you later. Cute. But the French... Are you with him now? I jump from one bed to another, you know. Seriously, I found him cruising In Stazione Cadorna. Oh! What is called sexual freedom. Your coming and going with London really inspired you, uh? I read what you wrote on the F.U.O.R.I. mag. By the way, your parents know that the editorial staff of the magazine has their home address? I wanted to put that of my beloved Marc and Laura. But who knows how they would have reacted to all those wild faggots. I spared them. Instead, dad and mama can't wait to receive them. And so they will all come to me, to tell me about their "vies homosexuelles". I will offer my advice better than a father confessor. What is this filth going around at home? Huh? I already had to accept having a son like this. But there is a limit. A limit that must be respected! And you... you went too far. Walter! Sit down, come on. Thank you. You always defend him! It's not just about pranks! Do you know what he is? He's a... A homosexual? Revolutionary...? You've always been good with words. But the point doesn't change. Walter! Mario is just more sensitive than others. So let's shout from the rooftops how sensitive he is! Daddy, the movement for sexual liberation... Liberation? But what do you want to liberate? You should liberate yourself from the stuff you wear! Look at the mess you wear! They are mummy's clothes. Mario, I'm old. And my health is not at the best. But I'm not stupid. No. I went through two wars. I experienced on my skin the racial laws. And fascists were keen on me. But they didn't break me. Do you want to try it? What are you trying to prove? Who do you want to challenge? You spend your life spinning silk careful that there Is not the slightest imperfection on the texture. And then you see that you got "tzaraath" at home. The stain that ruins your clothes. Mario, you have an intelligence. Out of the ordinary. I have always supported you. What are you doing? Do you return me this way? You can be whatever you want communist, flower child, also... I never understood, and I give up. But I do not want to see that stuff here anymore. How should I do with you, Mario? Do you see, my son is... he's a... Homosexual? Excuse me, is the F.U.O.R.I. here? Do you know, F.U.O.R.I.? You know, they told me that... Either you're out or you're inside. Forgive me. Here it is written... I'll handle that. Good morning. Your name, sir? Call me Ivan. My name is Ivan. And I'm a singer. Do you know Mario Mieli? Do you know if it's here or where can I find him? Welcome dear! What a pleasure to meet you. Come in, do you want something to drink? A coffee? A drink? No, no, thank you, it doesn't matter. What a luxury, congratulations! Yes, this is the Milanese headquarters. Of revolutionary homosexuals. Damn, where I come from we don't have these things. Where are you from? Bergamo. Province. Believe me, I can not take it anymore. I love big cities, metropolis. I love London. Also for the music they make there. That is revolutionary too. Ah, yeah, you're a singer, right? My mother too is a daughter of musicians. We Mieli have music in our blood. Excuse me, madam. I didn't understand that... No no. Please, let's go down, let's go down. How many things you'll have to tell me. Please. Do you know you're really cute? Come on, come on. The road to Amsterdam is long. What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go. Welcome back. Have you stopped doing the carrier pigeons? Mario never stops. It's not easy to keep up with him. He is tireless. I read your travel reports on the F.U.O.R.I. mag. Beautiful, very beautiful, right? Well, thank you very much. We travelled here and there. And Morocco? Marrakech was a real disappointment. No paradise for sure. Only marketing and lies. Luckily, Piero was with me. He followed me everywhere. He is a great travel companion. And he is an extraordinary painter. My Michelangelo. Or Raphael? And then where did you travel? The usual: Paris, Amsterdam, Berlin. Did you return to the Berlin wall?? Did you try to climb the wall again? No, it was enough having tried It three years ago. You would have done it if you didn't have your skirt. What about F.U.O.R.I.? No rethinking? Look, since I left F.U.O.R.I. I have clearer ideas. Like everybody. Too bad Angelo did not take it well. Uh, he's just a reformist. The gay revolution passes from our collectives. And what does he do? He threw it into politics, he sided with the Radicals. He turns sexual freedom into a political party program. If he's happy... I'm going to get a drink. I have to update you on a lot of things, you know? Uh, I already know everything, what do you think? You and Laura left the girls of "Cherubini Street". And Lia is giving birth to the feminist movement right here. She wants to open a women's bookshop. Fine, fine, fine. We must end phallocentric power. It is our common goal, dear, Homosexuals and feminists always go hand in hand. And whoever forgets it is lost. Listen. The comrades of "Re Nudo" (Naked King) Invite us to the festival of the Youth Proletariat at Parco Lambro. Are we all proletarians, right? Just in case, Naked Kings. Not really! We are Queens. Franco, you're not convinced? I'm joking. "Re Nudo" is the voice of the counterculture. They are on our side. Franco is right. They also defended us. When the Students Movement attacked us. Yes, when they shouted: "Out of Milan! No fags here!". Yes, I would have to say about the sexuality of some students! Hypocrites! So it's decided, we go there with our stand. We already know that they can not guarantee us a large space. As If we were not used to It. Should we trust them? Young proletarians but children of patriarchal power. I think It would be useful to go there. It is an opportunity to let them know us. Yes, darling, you're right. It is an opportunity to make our voices heard. And to sell copies of our magazine. They will be a success among the proletarian festival proletarians! Fantastic, it's decided. We will break into the Italian Woodstock. You must perform there. I mean, you're in the program, right? Yes, after Bennato and before P.F.M. Only at the thought I feel bad. Mario, I would be honored if you wrote the words of my song. Ivan, darling, you must be raving. I've never written lyrics for songs. Only poems, like my Marc. Yes, but it's the same. I mean, you put your poetic "style". And I add the music. Yes, you must write it, Mario. It's a divine idea! You are our lyricist, Mary! Our David Gilmour or Roger Waters. Oh, stop it. You know I don't like being flattered. But yes, I accept. I adore challenges. Well, let's do it now, right away. Then I will adjust the metric. Here it is. Shut up. Mario is composing. Oh, what a struggle. I got dehydrated. Thank you. Anyway, here it Is. Done! Done in the sense that you're done? Well, done and finished. The title is "Darling". "Darling". I already like It. Listen, everyone! Darling! What do you want me to tell you? Darling! What do you want me to give you? Darling! What do you want me to do with you? Darling! As far as I know, I just want to fuck you! Fucking revolutionary faggots! Revolutionaries don't take it in the ass! You are just bourgeois! Get out of here! What do you want to do, Mario? Certainly not respond with a fist. Well, well, I wanted to say this. We didn't come here, in this mess, to discuss, but to cruise, which means having fun, feeling good together. We came here to share together the great space of our desire, and not to have a space in a corner. Now they took off also this space. They threw down our stand, and they did not even explain why. And once again we find ourselves out. Unfortunately, the youth proletariat does not even guarantee a miserable ghetto to homosexuals. It means that we will leave. From now on we will not only cruise: we will fight! Come, come. Hard fight against nature! El pueblo unido is better disguised! And now, and now, make-up to all workers! Don't leave! A minute... Love, which permits no loved one not to love, and I am a great sissy! Hello, mom? No no, I can't come to Montecarlo. No, I will not come to see you in Lora. Actually I'm in London. It's only for a few days. It is not true that I interrupted the treatm... Mom, I do not miss a session. Yes, yes, it's all right. Okay, bye. Your son suffers from an obvious bipolar disorder. Are you telling us that he is schizophrenic? We don't leave it here for long, do we? Walter! I did not come here to ruin my life. Neither your son nor that scoundrel. Can make me mess up. This is clear to you, right? But the psychiatrist... So? He spoke about paranoid schizophrenia syndrome. Words. Yes, words. You must take an apartment for him, Walter. Mario needs some autonomy. Did he ask you? How do you feel? Better, doctor. Well. Very well. Tell me, what is your thesis about? Are you really interested? Well, I tried to merge. Marxism and psychoanalysis. I developed Freud's theories. About pansexualism. You know?? Pan, the complete, polymorphic human being. Before the advent of what I call "educastration". Edudcastration... Freud... you certainly know him asserts that Eros makes no distinction, doctor. There is no monosexuality. The real magic is to discover man and woman in ourself. You know, I don't simply claim the hermaphrodite nature of desire. And what do you claim? The end of all persecutions. Including yours. Why do you disguise yourself? Because cross-dressing is revolutionary. You think I'm an extravagant guy, an anti-conformist one. One who does not know how to stay within the rules of society. And it's all true. But you know, I aspire to a new Golden Age. Can I? Is she your wife? You are lucky, she is a beautiful woman. What does she do? Housewife? Why? I'm not accusing you, doctor. Also in the working class you see machismo and women are victims exactly like us... But, you know, in the long run it's frustrating. Almost as much as explaining to a psycho-Nazi that I'm not crazy, but just a little out of the norm. I know your thesis is going to be published. And by an important publisher. Are you satisfied? What do you expect? What do I expect? That it would become a kind of Bible for young homosexuals? Yes, maybe that. But to be honest, I don't know. I will be the Messiah of extraterrestrial intelligences. Do you like that as a definition, doctor? TV: The meeting of the week is with the writer and actor Mario Mieli. "Elements of homosexual criticism" is a recent essay of Mario Mieli published by Einaudi. Mario Mieli is fairly well-known. And he is a prominent exponent of the homosexual movement in Italy. He is here in the editorial office. What is cross-dressing, and why cross-dressing? Why do you disguise me? Because I like it. I often feel well dressed as a woman. So the answer is very simple. And then, too, with a bit of a polemical spirit because I intend to oppose that normality which I consider demented, under which women can dress up as men, but men can't dress up as women. Do you have a cigarette? TV: What are your personal relations, and in general the homosexual movement... Pretty, eh? TV: with the feminist movement? Stop that! TV: in my opinion they are improving. Because once an attempt was made. To find meeting points. This attempt seemed a bit ideological, a bit forced. Instead, now It turns out that there are indeed meeting points. I have also partly improved my relation with my mother, and with my sisters. And this is a positive fact. I can say that in general my friends identify in the feminist movement. Even if they do not necessarily belong to one group or another. "Panorama" mag presents you as a prophet of the future sex. This article. Because it tries to present me as a porn starlet when I'm not. I propose not only a liberation of homosexual desire... In all human beings, because in my opinion the liberation of homosexuality doesn't only mean feeling good. It means discovering the homosexual. Tendency in every human being. I don't know If I can make It. You can, you can. I have to know how long to stay in Bologna. If I can stay an extra night in Piacenza. Sure, you can. Now... look, tomorrow when you are travelling... I'll tell Fumagalli to make an appointment for you. Good night. Dear... What a day... It never ended. TV: You are basically also an actor. Do you think theatre is a right medium for that issue. Because the doubt may arise that instead the theatre is a further form of exhibitionism, of provocation in itself. And yet you think it can work? Absolutely. I think that in the Italian tradition... Commedia dell'arte is very important. And I'd really like that the Movement... It seems to me that it Is also becoming aware of some positive aspects in the last year, like the "Metropolis Indians" and so on. A return of the possibility of expressing oneself for the people through playing is important. Politicians always play. Bravo! Bravo! TV: So let's take back in our hands the opportunity to play. And let's use this means to spread proactive ideas. Bravo! Beautiful, beautiful. So... cheers to Mother Rai! Wait wait. Hooray! Congratulations. Let's have a toast. Me too. To you. Hurray. Would you like a coffee? No thanks. I have to go. You have been great. Bye. See you, bye. You're happy? Very much. Is there a place for me too? Of course. Thank you. You did well to go out of the collective. You can not belong to a movement. Your speech goes further, Mario, you know well. Indeed, you have become a celebrity. I think that if people like Bollati, Cases, Einaudi himself appreciate your work, your originality, You should be proud of it. It is a prestigious collection, no doubt about it. And then this book is not limited to bringing. Our voice out of the ghetto. Thanks, friends. That's why I dedicated it to you. You read, right? To Marc and Laura. The theatrical collective "Our Lady of the Flowers" presents. "The Traviata Norma (corrupted norm) or: fuck you..." RADIO: There was... the fact that this boy died. In Mascarella street. In Mascarella street? There were cars everywhere that blocked the road. He was the last of a line of comrades. When they saw that the police was entering. Mascarella street, they began to run away. An undercover policeman with a helmet on his head pulled out his gun, took aim fired four shots, took his back... Do you remember that guy sitting in the front row, the other night? Well, to make it short, he has a huge cock. Did you fuck him? I thought he was straight. Oh yeah, they all come to see us at the theatre, the "straight" like him. And then we bring them home. I know you... By the way... what about your move to the new apartment? It is not finished yet. Not even the Palace of Versailles! "Love, hold me tightly in your hands". "With your eyes closed you gently trust me". "And I understand you're beautiful inside". "Deep in your soul you do not have secrets". Spin the norm, spin your role, be under the illusion you are "normal". Doing so you only play the game decided by the Capital. Tonight there will be a mess here at the theatre. Come on, let's go and see these queens on the loose! Your mysterious queerness. You are hiding in speaking. Now that you're in here, male, stop playing a bit. Count your days, male boss, because we will make a revolution. Out of the ghetto, homosexual! Refine your nails against the patriarchal. It's already been half an hour, and it's still dark here. I am tired of waiting for the variety to start. But the vain Norm can not be seen. It seems that even in the theatre there's no more obscenity. Spin the norm, spin your role, be under the illusion you are "normal". Doing so you only play the game decided by the Capital. Here maybe some lights allow you to see something. The Traviata Norma is various and numerous. What are queers doing? Come on, here with us! To be just an extra artist is not suitable for gays like you. Count your days, male boss, because we will make a revolution. All the deviants took to the streets. To kill the crazy Norm! All the deviants took to the streets, and killed the crazy Norm! Now let's have some music. SO we can dance together. We'll think later at the debate. Don't worry, I only weigh like a feather. God, how beautiful you are! Thank you. Did you enjoy the show? Funny, but maybe I prefer La Traviata sung by Callas. What's your name? Mon dieu, mon homonyme! We have the same name. And with Callas we are three Mary's. We must absolutely meet again. Can I leave you my number? Does anyone have a pen? Thank you. Speaking of roles... You propose a figure of a woman-object that does not convince me at all. You should stop looking like that, talk in a feminine way. Wanda, Giusy... I, for example am homosexual. But this is not for that I should prefer sequins and glitter. What a macho! I'm happy you came. Will you come at me tonight? I still don't believe you're here. You are so beautiful. But I'm here since three days. You have taken me hostage. And three nights. My beautiful hostage. And to make me forgive, for having taken you hostage for three nights we go out tonight. I'll take you dancing. What do you say? I hate dancing. I want you divine, tonight. Divine. Here it Is. Let's see. Mario, what's that? This is female stuff. Precisely! No no, Mario. I've never dressed as a woman. Never? Never. Never, never, never? We must absolutely remedy, my love. You have to understand what it feels like. Como on! No, Mario. Here, let's see. These are perfect. Come on! Come on! Standing! No no, Mario... Look at yourself. A real miss. Here! And one... two... three... Look at these two shitty fags here. Now we have fun. Gentlemen, what brings you! Are you ghosts or werewolves? Actually, tonight, your jaws shine more than the moon. What the fuck is he saying? Suck my cock, faggot. Gladly, dear. We faggots are insurmountable in the fellatio. But I guess you already know it. Dear, I am an innocent child devoted to pleasure. And I find irresistible your vehemence. Pleasure is pain, do you know? Do you know Oscar Wilde? You don't look like Puritans. With these manly weapons of perversion that Marquis de Sade would certainly have appreciated. After all, we are all perverse, at least in power. There is nothing predictable in sexuality. And thank goodness. Otherwise life would be such a bore. Don't you believe? Surely you have heard about the famous homosexual inclinations of the Greeks? And about Freud, have you heard anything? Never read? I can give you a summary, if you want. But the substance doesn't change. What the fuck is he saying! Which substance? Darling... My house is nearby. It's right there. In case you would like a blowjob. Made in a perfect way you only have to ring the bell. That is the substance. Gentlemen, it was a real pleasure. It is not here that we have to demonstrate, but in Piazza Maggiore where they are now celebrate their Eucharistic Congress with the bishop who says Mass to save Bologna from the blasphemous. Well, fighting for peace Is. Like fighting for chastity! We are only sheep if we are still here to listen to what Dario Fo is telling us. Stupid! Stupid! Sheep! Sheep! You are only sheep! But what did you mean with "fighting for chastity"? Damn! I wanted to say: "Fighting for peace is like fucking for chastity". I said in a wrong way. What a poor figure! Forget them! They are just sheep. What they can understand? Baaaa... baaaa... Well, at least they look good. It's the taste that matters, honey. If we bring them as gifts to the editors of Lambda mag, will they like? Did you put LSD inside? LSD hurts. Shit no. What's this? Oh, it's a letter from a mason. A mason? Yes, he seems to be interested in alchemy, he wants to know me. Are you going to meet him? Well, why not? Since he is in Rome I asked my homonymous... Maria, do you remember? I asked her to organize a meeting at her house. Well, what have you got against freemasonry? Do you remember Count Cagliostro? We have already talked about him. He founded the Egyptian rite in Naples in the eighteenth century... Referring to Giordano Bruno. Yes, and then it influenced the masonry all over Europe. Good. Delicious. I wanted to meet you, Dr. Mieli. Thank you for allowing this meeting. Your book is very interesting. You have Egyptian origins, I read. It's not my merit I come from the pharaohs. Don't you see? My hair is my crown. And my throne is the toilet bowl. Engineer Siniscalchi... No formalities, call me Francesco. Francesco, as I told you, belongs to... Freemasonry. Freemasonry is not a bad word. We are for brotherhood. We are interested in the good of humanity, in philosophy and symbols. The passage from darkness to light, from lying to truth. I know you understand me, yes. You are a fighter. We have many things in common, more than you think. Do you say? Maria, my dear namesake, told me that you denounced the schemes of Licio Gelll. And of the P2 lodge. But I wanted to meet you mostly for our common interest in alchemy. For our common interest in alchemy. The philosopher's stone, the Rebis, the flaming androgynous. It's what you're looking for, I guess. The alchemical key of transsexuality. But maybe you miss the right century. Five or six centuries ago you would be a great alchemist. You are wrong. I believe I was born. In the right century. Anyway... ...we always work for posterity, right? You see, I'm looking for the key to... To the Paracelsus formula? "Melt gold, and you'll get oleum Mercurii". “Coagulate it as if you had soil and seed, male and female". Male and female". As I told you, I'm still looking. Good. Keep me informed about your research from now on. Also through our common and beautiful friend. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. TV: The body of a man was found in a car in Caetani Street. Caetani St. Is in the heart of Rome. So I give you the latest news. They say: police officers have... Here! Confirmation has arrived. The dead man is Moro. It was located in a red R4 car. Near Botteghe Oscure Street. You'll see, Moro's death will be the end of the Italian communist party. But if they are approving a lot of reforms? It has never seemed stronger than now. The truth is that you always want to contradict me. Say it again. Because I see that you don't miss an opportunity, even with others. Here is the real problem. We are the problem. It's you, the problem, Umberto! Fuck the politics! Fuck the world! You want to leave, eh? TV: ...to the news arrived only now. That is the identification of the corpse. They say the body was noticed by some passers-by... in a car parked in Caetani Street. The body of the dead again this news of 2.10 lies on the back seats of the car, wrapped in some blankets. You are here? You are here? I was afraid of not seeing you again. Very afraid. Can you forgive me? Am I so horrible? What are you saying? Look here. Look at my face. My forehead doesn't end anymore. A big nose... vampire teeth. I'm also losing my hair. And you are so beautiful. So beautiful. Before, you exaggerated. The fact that I am younger doesn't give you the right to... Do you have someone else? What are you saying? If you met someone, there is room for everyone here. Sometimes you are... impossible. I know. I know. You need to be patient. Hello. Hello. Hello, who's calling? Mum... Uh, it's you, what happened? What's up? Do you realize what time it is? Do you want to wake up everyone? Your father? Mario, if you're making one of your usual scenes... Mum... What did you do? You drank? Are you under the effect of some drugs? Sure. Mario, you need help. I go back to bed. I'm tired. Tomorrow we'll go to Montecarlo. We Myst wake up early. Have you ever tasted the taste of sperm, mum? Tell me, did you like it? Or did you retch? Did you rush to the bathroom and brush your teeth, mum? Or did you say a prayer? "Father, forgive me because I have sinned". Have you ever felt that taste deep down it in your throat? How does it proceed? In freedom. Can't the mind go crazy. Because of so much freedom? If I die, I'll give you permission to mummify me. You must find a way to put me in my family's cellar. With my Egyptian ancestors. In silk lingerie, maybe? I'm not kidding. Holy shit, Mario, death, death, death... I'm tired of this refrain, it's becoming an obsession. Mario, it's okay in poetry, it's okay in books, in monologues. Tell the truth! Which truth? The truth. That you are fed up with me. I'm going for a walk. If you, Father Lover don't want me to be happy bride soon... I will die, full of hatred. Then, in the afterlife, I will refuse you my graces, also if you would rape me and make me rape by all the angels and demons at your service. I will commit suicide. And in your arms I will despise you. Forever and ever and ever. A magnificent monologue for the poetry festival. Applause! Do you know what is the role of a clown on the scene is? To tell everyone that they are playing a tragedy. Mieli, have you finished? We have to go. Yes, do not make Mother Rai impatient! Mother Rai will be happy. You've never seen a... Fag. You can say fag, darling. ...Interviewing workers about that. TV: We are from broadcast TV. Who wants to disappear, disappear! Who does not want to be caught, runaway:. We are the television. Go on Mario. We came here today to have a conversation. TV: Who wants it? Go on whom is answering. I would be interested to know If you... Good, good, this is really great. TV: ...think that in your factory there is an attitude of disrespect, tolerance or understanding towards homosexuality. TV: There is more tolerance. When it is not mockery, right? Yup. Actually I would say that as someone said before, almost in every department there is someone, and he is in the closet. Someone is known and he lives I would say quite dramatically the fact. Precisely because... No, no, thank you, ...among workers the main element is virility. Do you consider yourself a virile man? TV: I would say that it is badly set If you put it this way. I mean, I told you because you said that in factory the value is virility, right? You are a person who is appreciated by the others at the factory, I guess. They love you, you have friendly relations with others. I think that the good opinion in factory. Depends on relationships. Here is the friendship that comes from having a personal relationship. There is good opinion and respect for what you do politically or in the union... so... It has many facets, I think the problem today is that since times have changed... I think that homosexuality is now accepted. It begins to be accepted. Because I see that once they were more mistreated, more... What is your deficiency? Do you know what is our deficiency? Our deficiency is that we are fed up with being despised, tolerated. We want human relationships. This is the only deficiency we have. For the rest we are fine! Got it? TV: Are there any of you who is willing to say that he never had in his whole life, a homosexual desire? Maybe, there can be such opportunity, no, surely there is opportunity, but you can't take advantage of it. But why not take advantage of it? It's pleasant! It's pleasant! Good morning. May I bring you something? Let's see... A Cynar. Two. Uh yes a bitter! So cute. I'm very happy to meet you. Indeed I did not expect you would be so beautiful. You are very kind, thanks for the compliment. Anyway, Umberto, I'm happy to meet you too. And I'm happy that my son... Don't worry, mom. It's just dry shit. It's just stronger than you, huh? Good. Bitter like pee. And you, Umberto, what are you doing? Do you study? Work? I study philosophy. “La plus grande partie de la philosophie c'est qu'un amas des incertitudes”. Did I tell you I'm writing a new book, mom? An autobiographical novel. I arrived at the scene where I put LSD in daddy's glass, and he ends up at the hospital. Do you remember? Oh, I talk about so many things. In this novel. Gay saunas. The psychiatric clinic. Your mister husband. His silkworms. Why don't you tell Umberto... Why don't you tell Umberto. About when I used to play with dolls as a child? I wrote everything in this novel. Everything. It will be a success. No, leave. It's on me, really. I'm just sorry that... It doesn't matter. I'm used to it. But I have to go. They're waiting for me. Goodbye, Umberto. I hope there will be another chance. I hope so too. Well, where are you going? Umberto! Dear Mario, I can no longer pursue and fight UFOs with you. Do not reproach me, you'll always stay inside, Umberto. No, no, no. Who is it? Madam, excuse me, my phone doesn't work. Can I use yours, right? Madam, it's a matter of life and death. I'm looking for Umberto. Is he there? What, he's not there? But I know he's there. Fuck, don't lie. Get him en the phone. I know, I know, please. Get him. Sure, I'm calm... I told you to get him! Want to see my princess dress? How is your friend Umberto? It seems like a sweet boy. I don't know. I haven't seen him for a while. What a shame. I'm sorry. You can't do it, Mario. I'm sorry but there are things that can't be done. And I understand that you too are now becoming aware of it. If what you told me is true, it is better that that book won't be published. It's Impossible, mom. I have already signed a contract. You can break the contract. We will pay the publisher what we should. You know, dad loves you. I dedicated all of myself to that book, mummy. And now I don't even know anymore what I want. What are you doing, Mario? Please, close. Why? You want to keep them closed so nobody hears? So everything stays in the family? I have no secrets. Why are you doing this? You have to hide your faggot son, eh? Is that what you want? To whom does the book give more trouble? To you? Dad? Giulio. But why do you keep feeling like a Christ on the cross? You can do what you want. Doe you ever think about my guilt, mom? I'm cold. Hi. Where to? Turin. Turin road, number...? No no. Turin, the capital of Piedmont, thanks. Okay. I'm sorry, Dr. Mieli. Cases can't meet you now, but you can talk to me. Why didn't you send me the drafts of my novel? As you can see, the drafts are here, ready to be printed. Dear, you do not understand, the last interventions you intend to do, don't convince me at all. I know you have been asked to change only a few words. You don't understand, I have to work on it again. I can't. But Dr. Mieli, by now... You do not understand. Excuse me, we're just trying to accommodate, believe me. Something else is not good. The agreement. But it was defined point by point, with your approval. You do not understand. You do not understand. Tear up that contract and call me a taxi, please... I have to get out of this place. Call me a taxi! In Christ, with Christ, for Christ. I will come up at your left. I will bother you for eternity. Dr. Berti, as you know, we have something to close. With publisher Einaudi. Because of my brother's book. I ask you to go to Turin as a delegate of the family. Sure. The publisher must take into account that Mario has torn the contract a few days ago. They must suspend publication. Return the leads. And each draft they hold. You know... My son... My son Mario... Just a few days ago he... It was he who didn't want. My brother was indisputably. And unfortunately sick. We are read to compensate the publisher of the costs, of course. Of course. You have the last draft. I want to read it. I'll read it tonight. I'll bring it to you tomorrow. You will be the last person to read it. Umberto wasn't the last person to read it. "The Awakening of the Pharaohs" was illegally printed ten years later and immediately withdrawn. It still awaits a real publication.
