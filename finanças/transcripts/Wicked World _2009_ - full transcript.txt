Come on let me out! ♪ She's running ♪ - Our world is such a frightening place. It frightens me, our world. The hatred, the violence, the murder. It all frightens me beyond comprehension. Today my mind has been working on the greatest book of all time. In my story there is a killer. And through the killer's eyes, we discover the reality of the world around us. Now supposing the killer's motives were purely for money, what might the killer experience within the experience? People will do anything for money these days. Now it's all coming together. Get away car better be ready man, there's gonna be a lot of trouble. You better be here. No I'm not leavin' the bitch, there's no time for that. After this hit we're headin' to Toronto. You better be there. You don't know who you're messin' with. Give me all the money in the till or I swear to God I'll put this through her neck. - Oh God please. - Give me all the money or everybody's gonna be dead. - I have no money! - You don't know who you're messin' with. - I have no money. - I want the money now! - Please spare me. Please don't hurt her! - Give me all the money or everybody dies. - I have a wife and kid. A wife and kid. - If I don't get the money. You don't know who you're messin' with. The chain's gettin' tighter and tighter. This chain will be full of blood when I'm through. - I wanna live! - I swear to God! My going back there. Lock the goddamn doors or ya's both dead and I don't know what's gonna happen. Lock the doors I said, lock the doors right now I mean it. Chain's gettin' tighter and tighter. Chain will be full of blood when I'm through and I don't know what's gonna happen. Die, please I don't wanna die. I don't wanna- - I swill haven't got the money, where's the money? I want it now. Where's the money? - Please let me live I won't- - Where's the fuckin' money? I'll get the door. It's all right, I'll get the door. Somebody's at the door. Get up and tell them we're closed. I'm not foolin' around, I'm not playin' games, I mean it. And you'll know it. The chain's gettin' tighter and tighter. Now tell them you're closed. Tell them you're closed or I'll choke her to death. I mean it. Listen man this ain't what I looks like. Hey man I'm not tryin' to cause any trouble with you. Hey listen man, wait a minute. I know what you're thinkin' okay, just take it easy for a second. It's not what you. Money, money, money. The root of all bloodshed. Now supposing the killer in this story was called names as a child by other children and now he wanted those children who are now parents to pay a high price for the name calling. Hm now what if the name calling parents and all their children were friends. Let's see what might happen. ♪ You were talkin' about the fly ♪ ♪ It's enough to make you cry ♪ ♪ All this talk about the fly ♪ ♪ It's enough to make you cry ♪ ♪ I wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ All helpless ♪ ♪ I wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ Can't feel it ♪ ♪ Wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ All around this ♪ ♪ I wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ You can say it ♪ ♪ I wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ Can you handle it ♪ ♪ I wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ I wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ Don't bother ♪ ♪ I wanna hear you cry ♪ ♪ Cry on the wild ♪ - All right, looks like a nice day out today. Good we're gonna have some fun today. I wonder if Marie and Don are down there yet. - Did you stop to think about the world we live in? Did you ever question why we exist? I ask myself those questions everyday, every living moment and the only conclusion I have is that we all live and then we die. That's it, it's all over. No more tomorrow's, once we die. - You know Marie has a point, when I was young all I knew was love. Then when I was seven, my mother and father divorced and I watched my mother hang herself from the telephone chord after my father shot himself. And ever since that time I realized that at any moment, we can die. At any moment, anything can and will happen in the world. - You know when I was young I waved at the birds in the sky and all I knew was great things and great thoughts. But now, now I know there's hatred and violence and love is just sex and lust and we live in a violent, violent perverted world. Which I think is true. It's a nice nothing. It's only the politically correct people in our world who close our eyes to the truth. They ignore the fact that we live in a crazy world. The laws we create. Ooh watch your step Fernanda. You walk much? Clinically correct people only create laws for the perfect world, they are not living in reality. - I agree, everybody's out to make money, or to create books for power and fame. And there's even a famous book. I forgot the name of the book, but all that's in it is violence, hatred and it preaches love. Why do so many people die in that book? Hi, how you guys doing? ' HOW you doin'? What's going down? How you doing? What's good? Hey how you guys doin? What's goin' down? When did you get down here? - Hey how you guys doin'? All right. No, no he's okay. Yeah, you look good! You lose weight? Yeah. - Take it all off, let's see what you got. I know. I know. - Okay, okay. - I know, I know. - Look at them cheeks man, oh my God. Take it all off, let's see what you got. - Hey I got a good joke for you, you wanna hear it? What's the definition of a gentleman? A guy that gets out of the shower to take a piss. I know. Oh nice snap there. Oh my God that's too high! That tickles, it's cold! That's cold! Excuse me for a little bit girls. Hey why don't we go in the woods and get some privacy? Come on let's leave for a while and be alone. Oh I can't wait to get you alone in the woods, get that bathing suit off ya. Oh my God, things I'm gonna do to ya, I'm just gonna make you feel like a woman. I just wanna rip it off ya and just jump all over you and just make you feel like a woman. Where's the Frisbee? No! Ah no! Ah no! Donna where are you? I just can't help myself. Oh my God, oh you're so hot! Oh Fernanda, oh. Donna where are you? Donna! Donna! No, no! No! You'll make me lose my load. Oh Fernanda, that feels so good. Oh my God, keep that up. Oh Fernanda you're gonna make me lose my lose. Oh my God, just go a little quicker now. I don't wanna die! I don't wanna die. I wanna live! I wanna live. I'm too young to die, I'm too young to die. I'm too young to die! I don't wanna die. I wanna live! I wanna live! This story is getting interesting but we need a cop because with a killer, there must be a cop. Let me think, the killer is on edge because three of his daughters committed suicide the week before last. How about the cop meets the killer? Now, all I have to do is- - Ring around the rosy! - Concentrate. - Ring around the rosy. Are you daddy's little girl? Ring around the rosy! You're such a beautiful little girl, are you daddy's girl? Are you daddy's little girl? - Roger Hoopscreams, 318. - Look at that. Who's that? Who's that? How you doin'? I'm your new next door neighbor, I thought id introduce myself. Hey would you like a hotdog? Sure I'll have a hotdog. - Come on. - 318, on 3rd street. Don't mind my husband Harold, his three daughters from his first marriage committed suicide this week. And he hates everything now more than ever. And he especially hates how we send money to other country's when people on our own streets are starving to death. Mm I must say. - Well we'll see ya on Saturday then. You make quite the hotdog sweet heart. Okay thanks for the hotdog. - Harold, I know your daughters committed suicide but you have to lighten up. I told you never to talk to another man. - We are leaving you you jealous bastard. - 27 hour battery, suspect at 318. If your callers want different people yet. I've had enough of you. With the suspect or with the victim. - The other report about several. - Grayson you're not readable. 318, Roger. Suspect is not there. Roger. - Harold, how does it feel to be a vegetable? What stories are you making up today? I suppose after the lobotomy you can't answer that question, can you Harold? If you only knew nurse Latino, the brain operation may have cut off my ability to rape another nurse, or stop me from terrorizing other patients, but nothing stops my mind from telling stories. I ask why is there so much violence in our world. Where is all the love we were all born into? Where is the love to rescue people like me. Why are we here? I hate this wheelchair. I hate myself. I hate nurses. I hate the blue skies and the green grass. - Be patient Harold, just be patient. If I could reach out and destroy this nurse, I would. All I want to do is tell stories. Oh that looks like a good movie. It's amazing, John Barry saw it before. - Man I don't know what's taking Trent so long. Hi and welcome to TV Nine News. I'm Amber Lynn, following top news stories of the day. Speak of the devil. What's happenin' dudes? Andrew this is Michelle. Michelle this is Andrew.

I'm going to delete this nightmare from the story and put a scene in the story between the killer and his psychiatrist. It will make a better story. Then we can see how the killer and his shrink interact. A nightmare would not tell it all. So now I will delete the nightmare from the story and let's a scene instead. - Harold they gave you a brain operation and I'm just as insane as you but in other ways. In fact, we live in a world full of insane people. Everyone is insane in their own way Harold. You're not the only one. I love those kind of movies, the give you the most incredible ideas. What kind of ideas? All sorts of ideas. Ideas about violence, ideas about killing. - What kind of deranged individual are you? For six months you've been coming here and telling me all these sick stories about killing other people. You can't go on living like that. - You accuse me of being so evil doctor Westbury. What about you? Are you so pure and innocent? Haven't you ever done anything you really regret? No I would never hurt anyone, not unless they deserved it. Deserved it? What do you mean deserved it? Nothing. Tell me Dr. Westbury, do you have other patients like me, or am I the only one with such wicked thoughts? - No, the world is filled with people like you. Sick people like you don't deserve to live on this planet. Dr. Westbury, how many other patients like me do you have? - None, you're the only sick demented patient I have left. Your day has come Harold. I'm sorry it had to be like this. - I could blow your brains out just like you want to blow my brains out. But that would be easy, much too easy. You make me sick.

Anyway I'm on the line, I've had it with this crime. Grant gave me his gun. Now You give me you gun McCreedy. - All I've ever wanted to be was a cop. That's all I live for. Just put down the gun McCreedy. - I'm going to put a bullet in your forehead. I was a bad cop, I was a real bad cop. When I was fired by the police force, I went out that night and. I went out that night and I had sex with three different women. I came home and she was murdered. I shot the killer one bullet after the other. Somehow he survived. He's in a mental hospital right now. - They say I have split personalities, who are they? Who the hell are they? They have degrees in universities but what makes them better than me? Anyway that's the whole story. Just don't worry about it. I can never forget. How about I gut it? The killer is getting out of the asylum today and the cop wants revenge and he goes after the killer with a vengeance. - The killer who brutally murdered your ex girlfriend is getting out today? I've been thinking about it all morning. I'm gonna kill that bastard, for once and for all. You can't do that, not in today's society. I can't? Why can't you just forget about her, and the killer and everything? I can never forget. - If I wasn't dreaming up these stories, I would be a politician and I'd be a great politician because I hate and despise politically correct thinking. In fact, I would make sure that anyone who was a politically correct thinker would be either tortured to death, or shot on the stop. These politically correct minority pressure groups, are nobody's with nothing to say. They are dirt, they are deification, they deserve to die like cockroaches. Someone should come up with a politically correct thinking hotel. I mean there's a cockroach motel, so why shouldn't there be a hotel for these politically correct thinking scumbags? They shove their worthless views down everyone's throat. These politically correct thinking zeros are creating an unbalanced society. The family used to be the nucleus of North American society. Whatever happened to the good life? Anyway, somehow I'm getting away from the story. Okay see you. - He's mine okay? - He's mine. - No he's not. - He is mine! He is so, what do you think? - He's mine! - He's mine! - No I found him! - No, I think not! - I found him! - He's my guy, no! Okay. You think you're smart just because. I'm sure he likes me better than you. No, no, no, no. You sent him here. - He likes me. - No, no. - Who do you think you are? He's my guy. Who do you think you are? No! Get away! Give it up girl! - No. - No. - And he's mine! He's mine! - Just say- - Mine! He's my guy okay? Stupid slut. - No wait, before the killer dies, he must die as a hero. His reasons for killing others have had to be justified. His reasons for going berserk had to be because of his daughters. His daughters are so beautiful and innocent, they'll never know why they did what they did. The killer's daughters were so young and beautiful, they had so much to live for. All people have so much to live for. Why does anyone ever commit suicide? I will never understand. It is one of the tragedies of our world. I despise the violence, the hatred, the sickness, the starvation, the unbelievable evil in our world. Will it ever end? Why do we have to die? Why do we all suffer in one way or another in our lifetimes? Why do we exist? Why are we here? I hate my world. Until our world has love all around, I will despise our world. Okay Celia, give me the gun. I will go first and you two will go next. Why do guns and bullets exist? Suicide is such a despicable act, it is wrong. Why do we live in such a wicked world? Why is our world such a mean place? It is time now for the grand finale. Once and for all there is no holding back. The grand finale time has come, I repeat again, once and for all. - Give me all the money in your pocket you bastard. You bastard. I've got a lot of friends you know and they don't mess around, they mean business. - Make a martyr out of him like Christ. Make a martyr out of him like Christ. We need another martyr, yes we do. I'm gonna tear your eyes, I'm gonna tear your eyes, I'm gonna rip you apart. We don't need anymore martyrs. - Make a martyr out of him like Christ. - Make a martyr out of him like Christ. - Make a martyr out of him like Christ. We don't need anymore martyrs. Yes we do! - Make a martyr out of him like Christ. Oh come on kick his ass! Kick his ass, come on now! Give him another one, give him another one, rip his heart out! Come on kick his ass! - Make a martyr out of him like Christ. Pull it tighter, choke him, he doesn't deserve to live, kill him! We all have to die someday, we all have to die someday. - I saw you'd gone down there this alleyway and on you, you were in trouble. And I always help out my fans. Give me the gun stranger.
