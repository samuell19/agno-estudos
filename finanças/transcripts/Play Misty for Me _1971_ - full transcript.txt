Hey, hey, hey. You're digging the master jock for solid rock. Sweet Al Monte blasting, babies. Being bold and pouring coal on station KRML in quaint little Carmel-by-the-Sea. And we're right next door to magnificent Monterey, home of the annual jazz festival. And don't forget, even though it's four months away, you got to get your tickets, Jim, because they're going fast and they can't last. All right, now. The time is 7:54 and there's a breeze of 50 degrees around your ever-loving hips, and the weatherman says we have a taste of fog. I say we got a bowl of soul, and if you think your heart can take it, whoo. Come fly higher with The Heavy. Now we're gonna wrap it up for the week, folks. A brand new release from the funk capital of the world, Squeeze Me. Oh. Here he comes, the big "D" himself, Dave Garver. Dave, people, is gonna bring you five hours of mellow groove. So, in the meantime, this is Sweet Al Monte saying hang in there, babies, because everything is going to be everything. Bye. Hey, what's that letter you got there? Is that that Frisco gig? Yeah. All right, so what's happening? They want the usual thing. A biography, pictures. Oh, really? Is that that Madge Brenner chick? Yeah, she's the one putting it together. Well, in that case, David, you're in. How do you figure that? Now, David, come on, man. Are you kidding? Hey, she's a grandmother. Well, so when did that ever stop you? Hey, man. You better get a move on. I already played your theme. Yeah, I heard it. You're a real human being. And you're on the air, baby. All right. "Men have destroyed the roads of wonder "And their cities squat like black toads "In the orchards of life nothing is clean or real "Or as a girl, naked to love or be a man with" This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by. KRML, Dave Garver speaking. Hello? Hi, what'll it be? Play Misty for me. Misty, huh? We have that right on the play rack. Thanks for calling. I see you got your little Misty chick calling you again. All righty. - Swing low. - You take it easy now, huh? See you in the a.m. KRML, Dave Garver. Hi, Murphy. Oh. Hi, Dave. No messages for you. No? Heard your show tonight. Yeah? Well, it sure beats hell out of working for a living. Thanks for the plug. What are friends for? Bartender. Coke? Coming right up. She's waiting for someone. You sure? That's what she says. Guys have been striking out all night. One game? Cry Bastion? What else? Okay, coach. You asked for it. Don't take all night. Move. Okay. Move. Palfrey's Gambit. Dirty rat. Are we playing Copenhagen rules? Make it easy on yourself, Murph. Cry Bastion. Sorry, no Bastion. Damn, I didn't see that. It's too bad, Murphy. Too bad. Careful now. That ought to do it. Be really careful now. Careful. Hi. He doesn't see it. Oh, yeah? Cry Bastion. Fool's ploy, my man. Fool's ploy. Care to play the winner? I'll just watch. My name is Dave Garver. Evelyn Draper. Sit down, Evelyn Draper? - Care for a drink? - Okay. - What'll it be? - Surprise me. Screwdriver. Nice game. Congratulations. Thank you. What happened? I won. How? When? When you said, "Okay." I ought to be mad. But you're not. Not really. Well, it certainly was nice of you to bring me home, Mr Garver? That's right. I don't think I've been stood up on a date since the ninth grade back in Albany. Is something wrong? No. I keep getting the feeling I know you from some place. You do? Here. Why don't you let me do that? Oh, no, no. That's all right. I've got it. Why don't you see if you can get the fire started? There are some matches right next to it. All right. It's getting late. You're sure I'm not keeping you up? No. I rarely get to bed before 3:00 a.m. I didn't have a date tonight. I went there because you talk about it on your program sometimes. And I wanted to meet you. I listen to you all the time. I knew somebody was out there. You're making fun of me. No, I'm not. Say something else, huh? Such as? "Play Misty for me"? Very good. You sure I'm not keeping you up? Don't you like me? You're a very nice girl. But who needs nice girls? No, I like them. I'm kind of hung up on one. And you don't want to complicate your life. That's exactly right. Well, neither do I. But that's no reason we shouldn't sleep together tonight, if we feel like it. Solid silicone. Hi, ho, David, my man. How you been, baby? See you got the joint cleaned up for once. The Heavy digs it. Care for a beer? No, not really. I could go for something more uplifting, but not a brew, David. Not a brew, my man. Beer is all we've got. Hey, Al, you're gonna have to ease on out. I got a heck of a lot of work to do today. Yeah, but you don't understand, man. I've been sent over here to get you. By whom? That old chick I go with. What's her name? - Carol? - Yeah, that's the one. Girl thinks you've been working too hard, man. She said we should get together and go out tonight. Blast the town open a little taste. Who's this "we"? Me, you, her and one of them hens that you can dig up. Man, there is a fantastic new Mexican place in Carmel called Susinos. And the albondigas soup is not to be believed. It is a mind-bender... I know the joint, but I don't have a date, and I got a lot to do, really. Big deal, man. Get one. Look. If you have any problems getting one, I'll get one for you, as nice as I look. It's too late, and besides, I've got a lot of work to do. Hey, man, but you gotta eat, David. Yes, well, I'm gonna whip up something right here in my own kitchen. You know, David, I'm really worried about your social life. You know something, you're gonna make somebody a tremendous mother. Too narrow in the pelvis. I sure appreciate you dropping by, Al. Come by again sometime, anytime. Never let it be said that Sweet Al Monte can't take a hint. - Who's hinting? - Hi. Why, hi there, yourself. Dave Garver live here? Well, that depends on your point of view. Oh, hi. This stuff weighs a ton. Where's the kitchen? Right inside. Just come on in and help yourself. Swing right around the bend there. Thank you. I know, David, she's from Chicken Delight. Look, don't work too hard, my man. Don't strain yourself. How come you don't have any beer? And what is this? A shrunken head? Who was that guy? Does he live here? - Hey, look. I wanted... - I hope you like steak. I thought you look like a steak-and-potatoes type. Hang on. I said to myself, a nice green salad with Roquefort and tomatoes, and baked potato with... What's going on here? Don't send me away. No, I want to ask you a question. I just wanted to surprise you. Surprise? What happens if he and I had been talking business? Or maybe I have female company or something, and you come traipsing in with an armload of groceries? That would be some surprise. I'm sorry. Why don't you keep that stuff? I think I've lost my appetite. Hang on a minute. I'm just trying to tell you something, that's all. I don't understand. Should I go or should I stay? What do you want? I'm trying to tell you that there's a telephone, and I pick it up and I dial it. You answer and I say, "Hey, what are you doing?" And I say, "I'll be right over." Fine. Next time, why don't we do it that way? Okay. Any way you like. Next time. How do you like your steak? Extremely rare. That's just how I like mine. Extremely rare. I'll get some wine. Here. A little vino. Vino. All this and heaven, too. Wow. Terrific. This is gonna be some dinner. Hey, what happened to that discussion we had last time? You know, the deal about no strings and all that? There are no strings, but I never said anything about not coming back for seconds, did I? That's right. You didn't. When will I see you? I'll give you a call. Dave, you're funny. How's that? If you want to keep playing these games, okay, but they're really not necessary any more, not for me. Hey. People trying to sleep here. People are trying to talk here. How'd you like to tell it to the law? How'd you like to go screw yourself? Hey. Take it easy. Guy's just trying to sleep, that's all. You're right. It's a terrific morning. Why be selfish with it? Bye-bye. Hey, wait a minute. Yeah? Oh. Excuse me, I saw the sweater, and I thought you were somebody else. Oh, you must be David. Where have you been? Oh, around. I was trying to join the revolt against the representational. Didn't quite make that, though. So now I'm just trying to play it cool. Not quite making that, either. Got time for a break? - Yeah. - Let's go. When did you get in town? Yesterday. You weren't gonna call me? Of course I was. I had to get settled first. Well, you shouldn't lend your sweaters to blabbermouths. You've gotten thinner. Oh, no. Well, so much for Sausalito. - Sausalito? - That's where I was staying. - Jay Jay's place. - Jay Jay's place? Oh, it's nothing much, really. It's just a little pied-Ã -Terre, but it's handy to the fleet. You told me you didn't know where she was. So I lied. Picket me. Thanks a lot. Listen, stud, it wasn't my idea. You should have caught her act. The whole Bette Davis, through-finished-kaput scene. And at 3:00 a.m. Come on, Jay Jay. He's exaggerating. Well, I'll check with Malcolm. Maybe I can get you the afternoon off. What happened, pussycat? He ran into Anjelica. She told him I was back. That bitch should be hung by the thumbs or something equally appropriate. It's all set up. Let's go. Oh, well, it's nothing personal, really. It's just that I happen to think she could be a first-rate artist if her damned hormones didn't keep getting in the way. There's not much he can do about that. He could kill himself. Jay Jay, why don't you go cruise some sailors, huh? Oh, please, don't mention seafood. Come on. I really missed this place. I missed you. You'd do me a big favour if you didn't say things like that. Why is that? I don't know. Somehow it brings out the worst in me. It makes me want to say things like, "How's that redhead?" What? The redhead, the one who worked in the Bookshop. She went back to Berkeley or whatever. Oh, that's too bad. You always have that blonde from Santa Barbara to fall back on. If that's the phrase I'm looking for, and I think it probably is. What are we gonna do? Go through a whole list? Is that it? Who's got that kind of time? I just don't know if I'm up to it any more. Up to what? Those nights sitting and waiting for you to finish your program and come by. Nights when it would start to get late and I'd start to think, "I wonder if he's run himself off a cliff. Or maybe he's run into a blonde." There was a time when I started rooting for the accident, you know. I mean, if it was a choice between that and a blonde. You know how secure you make me feel. Oh, I didn't wish you anything too serious. Just a couple of months in traction. You're all heart. You know, the thing I hate the most in the whole world is a jealous female, and that's what I was getting to be. That's why I had to split. I was starting to be one of my most unfavourite people. I hated it. I know you did, too. That still works, anyway. Too well, sometimes. What does that mean? I mean, there's a little spot in the middle of each day, just about your size. Well, there's lots of girls my size, if you're really looking. I'm not. That's what I'm trying to tell you. You mean you've given up girls? I haven't exactly been the monk of the month or anything like that, but I have been making an effort. Boy, there must be a real consternation among those gropies. That's "groupies," isn't it? I don't know. Groupies, gropies. You know, you've got to be fair. It hasn't just been my fault. Listen, I know. They kept overpowering you. You get a little bit of the blame, too, you know. You and that parade of room-mates that keep moving in and out of your place. I didn't realise they were such a trial to you. What trial? I enjoyed it. You and I sitting in front of the fireplace, and then some chick sitting there with a bathrobe on, eating Fig Newtons. What about the one with the St. Bernard? She was a real winner. She took up enough space. And then that other one, the one that took the flute lessons. Yeah, well maybe it was a little rough on you. I can think of a thousand reasons why we should try again. I've got about seven million things to do. What do you think? You want to try for a new start, right from the letter "A"? What am I gonna do with you? A lot. Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hi. You've met Anjelica, my... Room-mate. Yes. I think I'll drive into Carmel and see if I can't find some cleaning solvent. There's plenty under the sink. Okay. This house ought to have a revolving door. You know when my father left me this house, he left me payments. I can't handle that expense by myself, and most girls find the isolation is too much for them. It's a long way from town. I know. I better get back to work. Thanks. That's it, "Thanks"? Four months in Sausalito is a long time. I am not gonna get back on that same old merry-go-round again. What do I have to do, give you a notarised statement? I need a couple of more days to try and figure out where I'm at. Okay. You get your bearings, and then you'll give me a call, all right? Hi, Murph. Oh, hi, Dave. Sardine Factory. Dave Garver? You said this is Evelyn? No. Sorry, you've just missed him. What do you mean? He's gone. He's not here. I think you'd better look again. Believe me, you just missed him. Now, if you're interested in someone a little more suave and sophisticated, I'll be happy to... That's what I get for being a dirty old man. There's a message for you, a Madge somebody from San Francisco. - Brenner? - Yeah, that's it. Al Monte gave her this number. "Received pictures and biography. "Please send a two-hour tape of your show as soon as possible." Hey, thanks, Murph. Don't mention it. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be your social secretary. You will put that on my tab? Surprise. What are you doing here? It was funny. I was calling you from that phone booth over there, and he was telling me you'd left, and I was staring right at your car. Isn't that funny? Yeah, kind of funny. Why didn't you take my call? Where does it say that I gotta drop what I'm doing and answer the phone every time it rings? Do you know your nostrils flare out into little wings when you're mad? It's kind of cute. Come on, Evelyn. I gotta go. I'd love a Coke. Not tonight. I gotta get to the station. No, you don't. Hey, you're talking to your number one fan. You don't work tonight. I've got this show that I'm trying to set, and it happens to be a very important show to me. That means I gotta pick the music, I got to write the lead-ins and I gotta find some poetry. Now come on, will you? Poetry? Let me help you. I'm terrific with poetry. - I know all kinds by heart. - Not tonight. Does he want his keys? Come on, Evelyn. Speak. Come on. God. Good boy. Let's hear it. Come on. Come on. Give me my keys. - Come on. Give me the keys. - Come on. Give me the keys, God damn it. Having some trouble, lady? Get lost. Yeah, get lost, assholes. Yeah, let's split. He's got enough trouble already. Yeah. Excuse me. Bye. See you later. Hi. Get all your work done? What do you want, Evelyn? One Coke? I'll tell you, tonight I'm really whipped. What time is it? Time for me to go home. Go back to sleep. Hey, I've got an idea. What's that? Some night this week, after the show, corned beef and potato salad, dill pickles, the whole bit. My place. Deal? I'll call you. Thursday's good for me. Oh, shit. And now from KRML, the big-band sounds of Dee Barton. Here's a fresh reel of tape for your air check. You want me to thread it up? No, leave it here. Thanks. All right. I think I will go out and hit the streets, but before doing that, I will blow me a little number. Would you care to partake, my man? Take it in the other room, will you? I get zonked just breathing the air around here. All right, be that way. Al? Yeah? Do you ever find yourself being completely smothered by somebody? Anybody I know? Yeah, you met her at my house the other day. Ooh. Chicken Delight. Well, that's what I call a pretty good smothering, cousin. You start a relationship thinking you're gonna be completely honest, and all of a sudden the whole thing gets out of hand. Yeah, well, what's the problem? The problem is I've been trying to un-complicate my life, and now I can't even answer the doorbell. Besides, Tobie's back. Oh, really? Tobie? When? I ran into her Sunday. That was a goody. Hey, I'll tell you the truth, David. I've always thought that Tobie was one of the foxiest chicks on the peninsula. And why you gotta have so much action, I just don't understand it, anyway. You know what I mean? It's just a hang-up I have, or had. But now that I seem to have that all straightened away, I can't seem to solve this other problem. Well, you know what they always say, my man. No. What? "He who lives by the sword shall die by the sword." Don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out. Later. We'll have more smooth sounds in just one minute. But first, at 10 minutes to the hour, we're broadcasting from KRML in the Carmel Rancho Shopping Centre, home of the Buccaneer, the man's boutique. KRML, Dave Garver speaking. The whole point in having an answering service is to call them once in a while and see if you've got any messages. Hi, Evelyn. What's happening? What could be happening, darling? You're not here yet. "Yet"? I hope you like pastrami, because they didn't have any corned beef. Now, wait a minute. Just hold on. Are you trying to tell me you forgot that we have a date tonight? I thought I was supposed to call you on that. It's just that I feel kind of silly sitting here in my brand-new lounging pyjamas. I just assumed... Apparently, I assumed wrong. That's right. You assumed wrong. You don't have to come over, Dave, if you've got something better to do. No, that's all right, I'll be over in a little while. You and I are gonna have to have a talk. Whatever you say. In the meantime, haven't you forgotten something else? What's that? Weren't you gonna play Misty for me? Yeah. I have that one right here. Thank you, darling. And now we have a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night. It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty. And this one is especially for Evelyn. Just a second. Come in. Hi. Hi. - Cold night, huh? - Yeah. But you got here anyway. Stout fella. Look, Evelyn, there's something we're gonna have to get straight. It's amazing what a man will go through for a hot pastrami sandwich. Now look... Wait a minute. You haven't told me how nice I look. You look fine. The lady at the store guaranteed you'd flip. Now, listen. Can we talk? Wait. First... Surprise. Don't you like them? Yeah, they're great, but... Don't spoil my fun, darling. I love to give you things. It's Madame Butterfly time. First, friendly neighbourhood geisha remove honourable shoes. Stop it, Evelyn. Now, we've gotta talk. Have I done something wrong? I'm just trying to be straight with you, that's all. Be nice to me instead. Jesus Christ. I don't understand. Are you trying to say you don't love me any more? I never told you that I loved you. Not in words, maybe, but, Dave, there are lots of ways of saying things that have nothing to do with words. I'm sorry you read it that way. It's that other bitch, isn't it? What are you talking about? The picture in the silver frame in your dresser. Look, that picture has got nothing to do with you. What does have to do with me? I never lied to you. Big deal. He never lied to me. What do you want for that? The Congressional Medal of Honour? So long. What am I supposed to do? Sit here all dressed up in my little whore suit, waiting for my lord and master to call? Nobody asked you to wait for anything. You're not dumping me, buster blue eyes. Get off my back, Evelyn. Get off your back? That's where you've been keeping me, isn't it? You're nothing. You're not even good in bed. I just felt sorry for you, that's all. Bastard. You poor, pathetic bastard. - Hello? - I'm sorry. I didn't mean those things I said. Will I see you tomorrow? You don't listen, do you? Oh, let me come over. If I could just see you, just talk to you. No, Evelyn. But I love you, David. I love you. David, if I could just... What's the matter? Nothing. Why? No, come on. You haven't heard one word I've been saying to you. Yes, I have. I've heard everything you said. You did, huh? All right, tell me. You don't believe me, huh? Go ahead. Okay, wise chick. We're supposed to go to a party at Big Sur tomorrow night, and I'm supposed to meet you there at 9:00. And the address is... I didn't tell you that. See how you are? I don't know myself yet. I'll call you tomorrow about it, okay? Okay. You call me tomorrow. Honey, we better go. We're just getting to the best part. Yeah, but I've got to pick Anjelica up at 6:00. God. How the pain is setting in. Come on. She's a very nice girl. Anyway, she's moving out tonight. Now, that's about the best news that I've heard in years. And Madalyn's moving in. Madalyn? Shit. What's going on? Don't tell me it was asleep. What else at this hour of the morning? Oh, I'm surprised his conscience was that clear. What do you want, Evelyn? "What do you want, Evelyn?" What do you want? Do I have to want something? Can't I just come over? Or is it inconvenient? - Now, wait just a... - Could it be I make a boo-boo? Could it be that someone has been sleeping in Papa Bear's bed? Wait a minute, God damn it. Come out, come out, wherever you are. I thought... Oh, God, don't look at me that way, Dave. I just don't know what to say to you. I'm sorry I mistrusted you. I should have known you'd never do anything spoil it. To spoil what? What we have between us. We don't have a goddamn thing between us. Now, how many ways am I gonna have to say this to you? I don't care how many ways you say it. It's not true. What do I have to do to convince you? It's not true. It's not. What are you doing? I'm gonna get dressed and drive you home, that's what. Why are you playing these games? Why are you pretending you don't love me? I don't even believe I'm hearing this. But I love you. You haven't got the vaguest idea what love is. We don't even know each other. Wait a minute. You don't have to do that. I'm okay. I can drive home. Are you sure? Positive. I'm fine. Let me just wash my face, huh? You ready? You okay? Evelyn? Evelyn? Oh, no. How's she gonna be? Well, I sutured the wounds. It wasn't quite as bad as it looked. It couldn't have been. You know, Dave, I'm supposed to turn a report in on this. But you won't. You see, Tobie's back. I'd rather be the one to tell her, and not have her read it in the paper somewhere. I didn't know that. I'll tell Marie. We'll do the spaghetti number. Somebody gonna be around here today? Me. I'll be here. I bombed her out pretty good. Better let her sleep it off before you take her home. And how long will that be? It's hard to say. Why? I'd like to take Tobie out tonight. No problem. She'll wake up sometime this afternoon, 5:00 or so. Is she gonna be all right? Well, the cuts were really pretty superficial. I mean, do you think she'll try it again? Chances are against it. But I'd watch her. I wouldn't leave her alone if she seems unusually depressed or insecure. Better get some sleep yourself. You look like hell. Call me if you need me. Hey, thanks, Frank. I really appreciate it. How are you feeling? Okay. Fine. Here. Thank you. Brought you a little soup. It looks good. I don't know what to say. It frightens me thinking about it. Well, don't think about it. Oh, I don't mean me. I mean you. "Girl commits suicide in disc jockey's home." It's not very good publicity for a man in your position. Get some rest. As soon as you feel better, I'll take you home. Thank you, David. I got your clothes hung up in the closet there. Maybe you better answer the phone. Yeah. I'll get it in the other room. Hello. Hi. Hey I just wanted to check. We still on for tonight? Yeah, I'm all dressed and ready to go. What time is the party? Well, Madalyn's already left, and she won't be back for a long time, and I was just thinking... Would you be terribly disappointed if we didn't go to the party and just stayed here instead? Well, I think I can bear up under it. Don't be too long. That's me at the door. David, the way I look at it, the hell with Sausalito. Bye-bye. No. Evelyn? What's the matter? Take it easy. I had a dream. I was drowning in the ocean and I called to you, but you just stood there watching. Watching. It was just a dream. Oh, God, I'm so alone. Hold me. Hold me, Dave. Please. Please. Yeah. Yeah. Tighter. Tighter. Don't let me go. Don't let me go. David. I woke up and you were gone. If you have something planned for tonight, you could just take me home. Maybe that'd be best. No, no, there's nothing. Good. Isn't this nice? Just us here, together. Here we go again. Stone-cold dead in the market. Must have been quite a party. Go away, Birdie. Any other bodies, any other juice-heads around here? Come back tomorrow, will you? Or next year sometime. I better check the workbench. All right, break it up in here. Looks like old times around this place. Evelyn? Evelyn? Lose something, tiger? Look, Birdie, you couldn't find it within your heart to come back at a later time, could you? This is a later time, pussycat. I'm paying you back for the day I blew last week. Evelyn? Evelyn? Very funny, Birdie. Very funny. What I can't figure out is, with all this kind of action going on in here, what are you doing out there couching it? What is this, some kind of Kinsey Report? Do I come over to your house and ask a lot of dumb questions? Well, you just ought to, pussycat. Might open up a whole new way of life to you. Hold it. Let's try to show a little class, shall we? Mr Garver's residence. Oh, I'll see. Do you want to talk to a Madge Brenner? Yeah. I want to talk to her. Thanks. Hello. Hello, Mr Garver? Madge Brenner. We like the tape on your show. Like it very much. There are one or two others still in the running, but frankly... Why can't we have lunch today? Windjammer still good? Yeah, still very good. Reserve a table in your name. See you then, Mr Garver. Great. Bye-bye. Looks like we found Evelyn. "Good morning, darling. Gone shopping. "Back in a flash with the hash." Ooh. A little humour in there. "Love and kisses, Evelyn." And then it says, "if you can't find your keys, don't worry. "I borrowed your car." Here's your key, and here's your copy. That'll be 40 cents, please. Thank you. Have a nice day. David? I stopped by my... Hi. Don't you look all gusseted up? Well, good. I was gonna cook brunch, but this calls for something more festive. How about the Marquis? My treat. After all I put you through, it's the least... No, no. I have a lunch date. Business. Business? Yeah. Can I have my car keys? Sure. I think you ought to take it easy, anyway. Get some rest. Yeah, I do feel a little tired. Very funny, Dave. Now, let's talk show. Tell me, what do you think of the concept? The unstructured, the loosey-goosey, Monterey pop, Woodstock kind of thing? I like it. I like it very much, and I think I can handle it. So do I. I'll keep this to promote your new career with. You'll be working with kids, bright and marvellous. But they take handling. You know, if this show goes the way I think it's going to, there's no reason in the world why... Well, isn't this cosy? So this is your business lunch? How's business? - Friend of yours? - Just another trick, honey. That's enough. Is that your idea of a dish? My God, she's a little old for you, isn't she? What is this, "Be Kind to Senior Citizens Week"? Get out of here. It's not that I mind you being a bastard, but do you have to be such a tasteless bastard? Stop it, you son of a bitch. She couldn't get laid in a lumber camp. Stop it, you son of a bitch. You're hurting me. Stop it, you dirty bastard. Oh, no. Stop it. Dave. Oh, no. No. No. No. No. Don't leave me. Don't leave me. She's nothing. Nothing. Nothing. I love you. Get her out of here, man. Where to? I did it because I love you. Don't you understand that? I love you. - Where to, mister? - Move. It's because I love you. Dave, please. This is a private beach. I want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to you. Are you drunk? No, but that's not a bad idea. Why, David? Why what? Drunk? No. Why last night? That's what I came to explain to you. Okay, good. But I think we should understand each other. I'm not very happy with you. Well, that's fair enough, Tobie. Whatever it was, you could have called me. No, I couldn't. Why not? I couldn't tell you the truth last night. I'm not gonna lie to you any more. Now, why do you have to say that? I just didn't want to take a chance she'd try it again. What if she does? Well, I swear to you, if she ever tries it, I'd just let her go right on ahead. Oh, God. Oh, my God. What in the... Oh, God, help me. Please, somebody, help me. Help me, somebody. Oh, God, help me. Stay back, buddy. I live here, man. Is she your housecleaning lady, Garver? Okay, boys, let's take her out. Watch your step. Birdie. It's gonna cost you double to clean up this mess. Watch your step. Dave Garver? Yeah. I'm Sergeant McCallum. Any ideas? About what? About your girlfriend in there. Hey, that's not my girlfriend. Let me get that straight right in front. More or less a casual acquaintance, you'd say? That's right. She just dropped by to hack up your wardrobe and your cleaning lady? Is that what you're trying to tell me? I'm not trying to tell you anything, Sergeant. Well then, maybe you ought to. The lady almost got herself killed. And I'm stumbling around in my stupid way trying to find out why. What'll you have? This Evelyn Draper, where does she come from? - I don't know. - What about her family? I don't know that either. She just listens to my radio show, and we met one night. That's all. Practically a stranger. That's right. Then how does she happen to have a key to your front door? I don't know that either. It boils down to, you don't know a hell of a lot, do you? What it boils down to is I'm getting sick of your questions. And so am I. But they get upset with me down at the store if I don't ask them. Just take her through. I'll be right along. Right. Take her through what? Booking. What she really needs is psychiatric help. Really? Now, look, those cuts on her wrists... Don't know anything about those. There's one other thing. I know. "Don't leave town." I was gonna say, "Why don't you play some Mantovani sometime?" Didn't know you liked the show, Sergeant. I don't. I like Mantovani. Go ahead, play. Whoo. Those of you who may have played brass instruments in high school, you know that was triple-tonguing, baby. Let's give his tongue a nice hand. He might just be the fastest tongue in the West. Come on. All right, I'm coming. What do you say... How about something to eat? I've got to pick up my room-mate, Annabel. Madalyn's your room-mate. I found my man, and I'm moving out. And Annabel's moving in. Right. Ciao. Later. Thank you. Thank you very kindly. That was the Cannonball Adderley Group. And they're making it happen out at the Monterey Jazz Festival, along with Duke Ellington, Woody Herman, Joe Williams and many others. Still got tickets for Sunday night. So get on out there because that's where it's happening. Now we're gonna hear from the Gator Creek Organisation and Feeling Fine. KRML. Dave Garver. Hello? Play Misty for me. David? I didn't mean to shake you up. I'm sorry. Pretty stupid of me. I've been released. Therapy. It was a bad dream, but it's over. Where are you? The airport. San Francisco. I've only got a minute or two between planes. Got a job in Hawaii. You're all right, then? Fine, David. Fine. I just want to say how sorry I am about everything. Forget it. I have. I hope so. "Because this maiden she lived with no other thought" "Than to love and be loved by you" Are you near a radio? No. But play it for me anyway. - Hello. - Garver? - Yeah. - Sergeant McCallum. Sorry to wake you, but something's come up. Yeah, I know. She just paid me a visit with a butcher knife. Why? Because she was released on parole pending further legal action. When? A week ago. Well, I sure like the way you broke your ass to let me know about it. I just found out about it myself. Who's in charge down there, anyway? Now, look. Do you want to help find her or would you rather just sit there and bellyache? All right. Good. Now, exactly what did she say to you? I told you. She said that she was well and that she was going to Hawaii. What else? I already told you. Tell me again. You know, Sergeant, you really make lousy conversation. You make lousy coffee. Come on, what else did she say? Nothing, except... Except what? It was nothing. It was a line from a poem. What poem? If I knew that, I'd know the line. Wouldn't I? Try to remember. You know, McCallum, it's getting late. You're sounding very monotonous. Well, now, you're not exactly my idea of a swinging date either. Good night, McCallum. Hey, what happened to the Mantovani? The what? Well, I heard the show, but I never did hear you play Mantovani. You really did listen to the show. Friend, if we had a TV down at the station, I'd break my arm before I turned your show on. Thanks a lot. Just hope we're lucky enough to grab her the next time she tries it. Tries what? To kill you. Yeah. And if you're not lucky enough... That'd be hell. The guys down at the station would have to chip in and buy a TV. You're a great comfort, Sergeant. You will change the locks? Hi. Nothing like a nice brisk walk in the woods to put roses on a girl's cheeks. How are you? Not so good, honey. She's back. Who? Evelyn Draper, the girl who tried to kill Birdie. How can... How can she be back? I thought they'd put her in a state sanatorium. They did, but they let her out. Does that mean she's all right? Theoretically. What happens now? I think you and I ought to stay away from each other for a couple of days, just in case she's tagging after me. She's already following you, isn't she? I don't want you to worry about it. I can handle myself. Yeah. So could Birdie. All right then, you stand by. Well, they're all set to trace the call. Now, when she phones you, just mention her by name right away, Evelyn, and they start to trace her. All you gotta do after that is just keep her talking. Fifteen minutes before the hour here at KRML and here's It's Not Unusual. I guess it hasn't come to you yet, huh? What? What she said. Over the phone last night? Part of a poem or something. You told me were gonna try to remember. I thought I had that, but I've forgotten. Is it that important? Until we pick her up, everything's important. What's wrong? I'm worried about my girlfriend with all this going on. They're so damn isolated down there. I'm thinking the best thing to do is just call Al Monte and have him sub for me. Now, look. The only chance we've got is when she phones in here tonight. You've got to be here, right on that mike. If she phones. She will. Believe me. But only if you're here. I'll tell you what I'll do. If it'll make you feel any better, I'll go over and check your girlfriend's house myself, okay? I'd sure appreciate that. She lives on the Highlands on Spindrift Road. I think it's the fourth or fifth house down. "Williams" is on the mailbox. Why don't you phone her? Okay. Tell her to be expecting me. McCallum. Thanks, huh? Public servant. Hello? Hi. I'm just checking in. You all right? Marvellous. I'm just getting ready to do my nails and I got your program on. And Annabel's in the kitchen making a couple of coffee grogs. What more could a girl ask for? No, honey, really everything's fine. There's a Sergeant McCallum that's gonna drop by for a second, just to see if you've buttoned up all right. Let him in, but nobody else. Okay? Okay. Hey, David, you want to play something soft and dreamy for us? You got it. Bye-bye. Bye, hon. Hey, Annabel, how's that stuff coming? Now here's something soft and sentimental for Tobie and Annabel. Hope you like cinnamon in yours. Whatever's right. Annabel. Good, huh? Too much. So is this. Thank you. Just one thing. Do you mind? No, be my guest. The eyes are wrong. David's are more... How shall I say? Colder. I didn't know you knew David. I didn't realise you and David were... Were friends. Friends? Oh. No, not friends. Not friends. God, you're dumb. "Because this maiden she lived with no other thought "Than to love and be loved by you" Tobie? We're waiting for you, David. This is Dave Garver with a little verse, a little talk and five hours of music to be very, very nice to each other by. Careful. Careful. I might put your eye out. I'll bet David loves your eyes. And your hair. Does he run his fingers through your hair? Have to get you all nice for David. For David. I hope he likes what he sees when he walks in here, because that's what he's taking to hell with him. Miss Williams? McCallum? And now here's a pretty one for lonely lovers on a cool, cool night. It's the great Erroll Garner classic, Misty. And this one is especially for Evelyn.
