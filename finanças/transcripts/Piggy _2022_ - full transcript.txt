ON OFFER PIGGY I told you I'm not going straight out to the festivities. Maca, come on. Pretty please. We'll swing by the house to get dressed. - Roci! - Quit it. Shall we go to the waterfall, Clau? You guys decide. Okay, then. Let's see what my mom says. - YOLO, girl. YOLO. - All fucking set then. Let's get some beer and food and go. Go ahead. I have to go to the butcher's. - Wait, you shop there? - They're expensive. Go to the supermarket. My mom placed an order. We'll meet at the waterfall. - I'll come with you. - Nah, it's all right. Come on, it'll be a laugh. Come on! Hey, blondie. Your order's almost ready. Thanks. Where have you been this summer? We've barely seen you. Hi. Hi. Want some rabbit? It's on offer. Sara shot them. No, thanks. So, tonight you're heading to the Madrigal festivities, right? What about you, child? - Are you tagging along with Clau? - I have to study. Study? Kids have to have fun! - Right? Ask Mom. - Ask me what? She wants to go out and party. If she's finished studying... Fancy homemade blood sausage? - No, thanks. - Thank you, sweetheart. Bye. Bye. Come on, tidy this up. I'll make lunch. Get moving, child. Didn't you hear Mom? Come on, move it. #THETHREELITTLEPIGS MACA: FUCKING FATSO - You animal! - You're a goner if Mom sees you. Watch it! The things I put up with. Excuse me, do I know you? All right then. What are you looking at, clown? In yesterday's running of the bulls in Madrigal de la Vera, a young bull escaped the bullring, causing chaos and charging a resident. The young bull's escape caused great commotion among the attendees, who watched as it jumped over the protective fences and ran out. The Guardia Civil... Put your phone down while we eat. Enough already. Same thing every year. It's no joke. Remember when one got into Luciana's house. Remember? Sara, your hair, please. What's wrong? Not hungry? Bull runner since 14. I've been waiting a year for this town's run and it's exciting. As they say, you have to experience this and learn it since you're a kid. You could go hunting with dad tomorrow. Child, I'm talking to you. Facing a bull feels incredible. What do you say, Dad? - Dad! - What? - Hunting, tomorrow. With her. - If she wants to. It's not about if she wants to, she needs to go out and get some fresh air. But you have to get up early, Sara. Otherwise, it's a waste of time. Whatever. She doesn't even want to go hunting now. What next? - Don't say you don't go out. - Well, it's up to her. - Why can't I come? - Not you, rugrat. Switch it to the soap opera! It's started. Do you need something or are you just pestering us? EVERYTHING FOR THE MOTHERLAND Are you going to hook up with Pedro? - Maybe. - You're so cheeky. Look, Clau, your friend. Aren't you going to say hi? I'll say hi. Come on, Maca, let's get dressed. Piggy! Have you missed me? What are you doing here all alone, Piggy? She's not alone. Can't you see she's got a boyfriend? No! No, Piggy, no. You got a boyfriend and didn't tell me? I thought we were friends, Piggy. Nobody wants to be with you. Did you give him ham for him to love you? Or was it pork belly? How do you talk? Oink, oink, oink? Like this? Check out her bikini. Her body just swallows it. Totally. Quiet, quiet. Why don't you say something? Huh? Oh, that's great. Eat your hair. Eat it! Tasty hair! Yes, it tastes like bacon, like fat, like pork belly. Full of fat. It's what you like. How tasty! You're so lucky that you can eat your hair's fat. Why are you smiling? Are you laughing at me? She's so disgusting. Look at her. Leave some water for us. You pig! Piggy! Look, he's leaving. You'll lose your boar. Your boyfriend's leaving. Oh, darling, you're all alone now. You've scored at last, Piggy. - Girl, come here. - Come on! What's your deal? Let's catch the pig-whale. - Maca, Maca, you're going too far. - Seriously? Maca, come on, quit it. I'm just kidding. - Help! - You're playing along, right? You have quite the rubber ring there, you're not going to sink! Stay still, Piggy. You're going to break it. We're just playing, right? Just play with me then! What a stupid girl. Help! Claudia! Help? Claudia, she's asking for help. Help your friend. Help her. Yeah? - Are you a pig like your friend? - Claudia. Piggy, smile! You look amazing. You'll break it, Piggy. - Isn't her backpack cute? - Yes. Let's go. No! Claudia! No! Let's go, Clau. - Hurry up. - Grab her towel. No! No! Miss Bacon! Come on, Miss Bacon! Come on! Oh, fatty! - Bacon! - Come on, dude. Run her over! She's going to sink the bridge! Run over her! Come on, bacon! No! No! No! No! Relax, Miss Bacon. - Go for it, dude. - No! No! - Gross! Fatso! - Bye, Miss Bacon! Such a cute little piggy! Sara, please! Sara! Sara, help me! Sara! Sara, help me, please. Sara! Sara, help me! Sara! Sara, help me, please! Sara! Sara! Sara... Sara, please... Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara! Sara! No, no, no! No! Sara! Sara! Sara! No! EVERYTHING FOR THE MOTHERLAND Chill out! You okay, kid? Sara! Are you deaf, huh? Look at you. You're burned to a crisp, you're going to peel red raw! Put some aftersun on! Honestly, you're so foolish. You've been at the pool, right? Of course... instead of studying. What's wrong with you? Get out and head to the shop! Stop wasting time. Come on! Come on! This child, honestly... Aftersun lotion! THREE LITTLE PIGS Fuck them. BACKPACK May I leave? Now, child? You've not lifted a finger yet. If Mom finds out... The light's burnt out. Go on. Go to the shop. I'll note it down. - I have to study. - Not that story... - What if someone comes in? - Who? Nobody's been in all afternoon. Here. Grab me a cold cola, and get yourself something. Go on. Come on, Sara. You're letting the cold air out! You can buy these, but on your head be it. Okay, I'll leave it. Girl, what happened? - At the pool, something happened. - What are you talking about? What's wrong with you? Why don't you pick up? - Dad sent me to get a light bulb. - Right. Something happened at the pool. Do you know anything? No. - Let's head over there. - Where? Where else? To the pool. But Dad asked me to... When have you ever been in a rush? Dad can wait. - Come on. - No. Don't you want to find out what happened? But... I'm not wearing my swimsuit. Why do you need one? Oh, come on, child... Oh, look at you with that beautiful mouth. What? Nothing. It will be worse if I find out later. Who was at the pool? No one. The lifeguard was there, right? No. And the waitress? Child, honestly, I have to pry things out of you. - Mom, what's wrong? - We'll find out now. Can you get out, child? Come on! Keep this under control. I don't want the northerners butting in. Can't someone else do this? It's the first time something's happened. Do what you're told. We should take photos. Murderers usually come back. Photos? Of the old ladies? Are you kidding me? - What's going on... - You can't pass, Asun. - What happened? - I can't say. - They found Rober dead in the water. - Luciana! And Rosa, the waitress, is missing. Oh, my God. No, no... - Move over. - Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. How long has the corpse been there? Asun, let us do our job. Tell her to leave, I just got here. Hey, I'm not interfering! Bravo, girl! There goes the crime scene! See? I knew it. My daughter bathed with the corpse. - I never saw her near the pool. - She came after lunch. - After lunch? - Yes. Corporal, please come. She's got stomach cramps. - You have to wait two hours. - At least. - Mom, let's go. - What's the fuss? - Why are they still here? - I want to know how long the corpse has been there. She bathed there. She might have caught something. She was here this afternoon, I saw her coming back. The dog went wild. Every day. As soon as it smells her. Is that true? Were you here in the afternoon? She comes here every day. She thinks I don't know. Did you see or hear anything strange? Are you okay, child? What's wrong? I never... Louder, girl. I never went to the pool. What do you mean? You got sunburnt like a fool. I went to the river. As it's shallow, I got sunburnt. To the river? You always go to the pool. They call me "Piggy." That's why I don't go. And you do nothing. What? - Sara, don't lie. - It's true. Asun, take her home, will you? - Don't waste our time. - Enough, shut up. - Clear this up at once. - Dad... Sorry, Corporal, she... Don't make me repeat myself. Yes, Sir! Come on, move it. Move it or I'll start dishing out fines. - She's actually quite fat. - Come on, Luciana! So, you were never at the pool? And that I do nothing? You'll see now. Wait and see. Oh, take this. It'll settle your stomach. No, we never knew! The last thing we expected there was a dead guy. The Civil Guard is looking for the missing girl's boyfriend. Help from the public is requested to find him. To that end, several... Why don't they use "Find My Phone"? What's that, child? An app. If they have her laptop, they'll find it. With the town's network coverage, they'll never find him. What is it now? I'm hungry. Don't they call you fat? Eat less then. That's all. Who calls you fat? - Maca, Clau... - Shut up! Clau, the blonde girl? - So two-faced. - Does it matter who? The town is full of spite. The fact is she's fat and has to lose weight. You're also fat. They don't call me pig. From now on, salad and greens. I don't want to hear a peep out of you. That's it. - What did I do? - Earned it. A crime of passion at the hands of the missing girl's partner. Close sources indicate that the woman may have been in a relationship... with the dead lifeguard. This has been absolutely horrible. Nothing serious has ever happened here. At most, a fire. Not much else. Help! And this towel? From the market. Hello? The door's open with a murderer in town? Want us to die from heat? Besides, it was Rosa's boyfriend. Who is it? - Damn. - May I come in? What are you doing here, Elena? Sorry for my intrusion. - Bon app√©tit. - Thank you. I've been calling Sara and she isn't picking up. Where's your phone, child? Upstairs. - Is that Sparky? - Yes. Oh, I didn't know. My condolences. What do you want with my daughter, Elena? You'll think I'm crazy, but Claudia went out this afternoon with Rocio, Maca, and Pedro, and she's not picking up. And after the incident... What does that have to do with her, huh? I don't know who else to ask. And since they were friends and we live close by... - Do you know anything? - They'll be at the festivities. So, you come to my home to question my daughter? Asun, I'm worried. - Don't you understand... - All I know is you have no shame. - Excuse me? - Your daughter, Maca, and that slut Roci, call my daughter a pig. Pig. They bully her. And you have the balls to come here and enquire? My daughter doesn't bully anyone. Tom√°s, do you get me? I really wouldn't know. Sara, have you heard anything? Talked to them? Say something. I won't get mad if she's with a boy. - Kick her out. - I'm eating. - Please, tell me. - Elena, please leave my house. - Please. - Get out of my house! - Come on, get the fuck out! - I'm leaving. Shameless! You, grow a pair. She's one of the few who still buys from us. She's your daughter! Besides, they don't buy much. Stop hiccupping, you look like a fool. Boo! You're driving me crazy. You're all driving me crazy! - I need the laptop. - I'm using it. Hand it over or I'll tell Mom you watch porn. - I don't care, you do the same. - Lies. I've seen your browser history. I need to find a phone with that app you mentioned. Go away, you can't find Claudia from our laptop. You can only do that from hers. Or from her tablet. Could I find my phone? You lost your phone? Mom's going to kill you. I didn't lose it, idiot... never mind. You're the idiot. So you made all this selling pills and hash? Don't say that I traffic the Romanians' stuff again. Moron. Kid, will you stop fucking around with the ball? Come on, let's leave. See you later, Ricky! Don't touch me! What are you doing? Scaring Dad. There's a murderer on the loose and you go around scaring people? Unbelievable... - This girl's a moron. - Watch your mouth! Do something useful, child. Grab me a cold beer. Oh, look, it's your dad. What do you know about the two cops who are missing? - Missing? - Dad... You can't leave those bastards alone... That's my boy! Hey, where's Luciana? Asleep in front of the TV. You know what she's like. Good evening. I don't get why we have to look for the young bull. Do you know the mess we're in? Are you that thick? Because we know the bloody area. Who else would look for it? The mayor? Besides, the bull should be close by. Corporal, Asun's daughter is lying. We should interrogate her. Are you going to shut that mutt up or should I? SARA DAUGHTER Are you sure? I don't know. It said it was this way. There's no signal now. - Do you even know how to use that? - Yes. - Fuck, this is in the middle of nowhere. - I'm surprised it works. This town's network coverage... Do you girls come here often? I don't know. Perhaps they lost their phones. All three of them? We're blowing this out of proportion. My daughter doesn't go missing out of the blue. - What do you mean? - They're being kids. You convinced me not to go to the Civil Guard - so as not to get them into trouble. - They're probably partying. That says my daughter is in the middle of this forest. I'm not backing out. I'll go alone if I have to. Let's go then. Maca's going to be grounded until the day she dies. It just moved! - They are here! - Thank goodness. Wait until we get them... Which way? That way, but it's disappeared again. Come on, let's go. Claudia! Roci! Maca! - Claudia! - Maca! Sara. Claudia! Where are you? Roci! Maca! Claudia, please, say something! Claudia! Girls, it's Amaya, where are you? Maca, where are you? Please, it's your mom! Roci! It's Dad! Claudia! Maca, can you hear me? Roci! Claudia! Claudia! Where are you, Maca? Roci! Roci! Hello? Claudia? Maca! Maca? What? Is it moving? No. What if it's not them? She's dead! Dead! That's no young bull. What have they done to her? Call the Civil Guard. Fuck, call! My Claudia. Claudia! Claudia. Claudia! Help! - Please, help! - Claudia! - Where are you? - Let's go! Come on. Claudia! - Claudia! - Come on! Claudia, come back! - Claudia! - Come on, Tarao! Claudia! Come back! Anyone there? Stop! - Stop! - Come back, Tarao! - Tarao, come back! - Stop! Easy, easy. Elena, are you okay? - Yes... - What happened? - My daughter... - But are you okay? I don't know where she is. Relax, we'll look for her now. Relax. Yes. I'll get it. It's on the floor. You're losing your mind. I swear I looked everywhere! Yet I'm the one who came downstairs... What were you thinking? What did you eat? A yoghurt. Sara... Biscuits and... chocolate. You're starting your diet tomorrow. Stop messing around. Go on, get upstairs. CRIME IN EXTREMADURA LIFEGUARD FOUND DEAD Sara... I can't... my parents. Okay, I'm coming down. - Hey. - Hi. Let's go. Chill out, I don't bite. Why did you lie? Huh? Claudia sent a video to our group chat. You were at the pool. They're not answering their texts. We were meant to go together, but they were no-shows. It doesn't add up. What happened? - Nothing. - Bullshit, I saw the video. They picked on me. They took my bag and I had to walk back home in my swimsuit. That's all? So... you were all at the pool, right? Rober is dead. Rosa, the waitress, is missing. Something went on. - I didn't see anything. - Stop bullshitting. They nearly drowned me. Why did you lie then? The police, my mom... were there. What do I even say? That they nearly drowned me? That they nearly killed me? They pick on you, right? So do you. No fucking way. Not like that. - They sent you the video. - I deleted it. - Deleted the evidence. - Not true. I deleted it out of pity. Pity? I'm so sorry. First-timer, yeah? I can tell. What's up, Pedro? Let's go. My mom. Chill, chill. Everything's fine. Come on. Seriously now... you have to say you saw them. What if something happened to them? It would be of no use. Of course it would. They'll think it was me. It's always the same shit in this fucking town. You won't believe the scene Claudia's mom made at home. As if I'd done something. I can't get into any more trouble. My dad will kill me. You don't know what he's like. I can't. - If they find out what I did... - What did you do? You did nothing. You just lied. I can end up in jail, you know? If something happens... I mean, if you're accused... I'll tell them about the pool, okay? Okay. Thanks. Anyway, they're probably just partying, going wild. Right? Relax, it's okay. What's this? C.S.? What the fuck? - Okay? - You! Where's Claudia? What did you do to her? Nothing. - Don't lie. - Really... The waitress was found dead. Claudia's phone was nearby. Please, what happened? What happened? I don't know. I know nothing. What do you know? Elena, let the girl be. She knows something. What's she doing with him? Leave her alone, Elena! Your daughter knows something! Tell her to talk. She knows! Leave her alone. They're up to something. They've been up and down all night. - Let's leave. - No, she knows something. - Let go of her, Elena! - Mom! - It was Sara. - What? What are you on about? Sara was last to see them at the pool. - My daughter wasn't at the pool. - She was, fuck! Maca and Claudia tried to drown her. It's filmed. That's not true. Let's go. What did you do to her? Tell me! - Let go of her, I'm warning you! - Enough! Mom, Mom! Hey, quit it! Easy! Listen, madam, as soon as we have any news, - you'll be the first to know. - If something happens to my daughter, it'll be on your conscience. Come on, Elena... Relax. Let them do their job. - It's my little girl, Mar√≠a. - I know, I know. Come on, let's go. Come on. Let them do their job. They know what they're doing. Come on, relax. - She's my little girl. - I know. - It's my little girl. - I know, I know. Come on, darling, we're leaving. We're not accusing you of anything, dear. We just want you to tell us what you know. You understand, right? Caffeine for the girl... at 3:00 a.m.? It's what we have. Come on, Asun. Let her be. You're keeping us here when there's a murderer out there. Wasn't the scene you caused outside enough? You'll be lucky if she doesn't press charges. You want me to do nothing while they mistreat my child? Let's get down to business. We just want to know what happened at the pool. - In your own words. - And why did you lie? My daughter never lied. It was Pedro. Corporal, kick Asun out. Can't you see the girl's scared? She's a minor. Her mother has to be present. You heard. Juan Carlos, carry on. What Pedro said is true, right? You never went to the river... right? You were at the pool. - Yes. - For heaven's sake. What happened? Roci... Maca... Clau... they picked on me. - They nearly drowned me. - Cunts. Asun! Carry on. Relax. They... took my clothes... my bag... my towel... and... I had to walk back home... near-naked. And what did you do? Nothing. Did you see Rober? Rosa or her boyfriend? You saw nothing? I know about "the three little pigs". I saw the hashtag. Is that why you lied? You didn't want to snitch? I get it. You know? But this is serious. Your friend's phone was near Rosa. And Rosa's dead. She's dead. Tell me the truth, Sara. Help us. - I... - Enough! - We're leaving! - Asun! - Is she accused of anything? - We're just talking. - Is she? - No, Asun. She's not. Then she has nothing else to say! Let's go! Sara, this is really important. Anything you say may be key. They might be in danger. Let's go! - No, no! Corporal! - Asun, you're making a mistake. I might be dumb, but I know my daughter doesn't have to say anything - unless in the presence of a lawyer. - Fucking films! - Shut up! - Come on, move it. - Wait! - What is it now? Blood. Thanks. Not your finest moment. Relax. This isn't over, partner. Get in. We'll give you a ride. Forget it, she's on her period. She'll leave your car in a mess. All right then. As you like. And sorry if this brute caused you any trouble. Not a word, yeah? Not a word! Not a word until we get home. Understood? What the hell? The door's wide open... This man's an idiot. Get downstairs at once! Turn the fan on if you're hot! Sara! Get downstairs! Sara... run... Please, take that off... I'm not a little girl! - We have to soak it, it will stain. - I'm not a little girl! Stop treating me like one! You embarrass me all the time. Take that off at once! Listen to me! If you're such a grown-up, fair enough, you'll wash your own clothes from now on. Your clothes... and you'll also wash this. What's this, Sara? What's this blood, Sara? This is Claudia's towel. It's Claudia's. Why did you lie to me? Tell me what happened, Sara. Tell me what happened. What did you do? What the fuck did you do? Tell me! What happened? I just want to help you. Tell me! - You don't get me! - I do! You're just like everyone else. Just like them! Shut up! Shut up! Leave me alone! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I hate you! I hate all of you! I hate you! - I wish you were all dead! - Enough! I wish you were all dead! Run! Fuck! Run! There's no toilet paper. There's no toilet paper! Mom? Sara? Sara! No. No, no, no... Help... Look, it's Miss Bacon! Bro, just who we needed tonight! I can't believe it. Come over here, Miss Bacon! The party is here! Bro, lardass has scored. He's going to indulge in some pork chops! Come with me, Piggy, my sausage is better! Come, you'll have a better time! - He's going to eat her, bro. - Look at that! He is going to eat her, bro. What a perfect night. Where are you going? Let them go. What are you doing? Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! My fucking arm! Are you okay? Yes, yes. You're alive! Sara! Where are the police? Sara! Sara, he's gonna come back! Sara! Sara, where are they? Sara! Sara, what's going on? Sara! Sara, he's going to come back! Sara, where are they? Sara, what's going on? You didn't tell anyone. Why? Why? Sara, why? Why, Sara? Why? I'm scared. I was scared! I do everything wrong! I do everything wrong! He's going to kill us! Sara, he's going to kill us. Because of you. Sara, untie me! Hurry. Sara, untie me! Hurry up! Untie me! Sara, untie me! No! Fast! Hurry up! Sara! Ow! You idiot! You idiot! Enough! Sara... help me. Run! Sara, run! Get help, hurry! No! Sara! Fuck... Sara! Run, Sara! Shut up! Run! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! - Where is she? - She went for help. No! - She's gone! - Where is she? Sara! Sara! Come back! Come back, Sara! Sara, help me. Shut up! Shut up! I don't want to die. I don't want to die. No, no. You're not going to die. No... We have to leave. Come. We'll do it together. Help! Help! Help me! Help! Help! - Fuck them. - Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Come on! No... No, no, no! No, no, no! No! No, no, no! No, no, no! No! What have you done, Piggy? Sara, I'm sorry. Sara, please! Sara, I won't say a thing. No! No! Sara... Sara? What happened? Are you okay? Help. Of course. Get on. We'll head to town. Relax. It's all over. Hold on tight. PIGGY Translation: M. Mitha Subtitles: Bbo Subtitulado
