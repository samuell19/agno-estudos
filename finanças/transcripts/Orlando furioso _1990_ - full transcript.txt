In the depths of this dark world... ...my heart rushes forth to meet its inexorable destiny With true courage, the strongest love will conquer The tossing of this stormy sea... ...is like the tempest in my loving heart The sea sends forth its waves... ...and my tender yearnings send forth my pangs of anguish Now the sandy sea bed is revealed Now the furious sea swells towards the sky Help! Help! Poor fellow! What is this I see? A tiny boat, tossed by the sea, on the point of shipwreck Have courage, stranger, beat back the sea's onslaught Here he is now, safe from Neptune's raging fury I have returned to behold you, my beloved idol Can this be true? Ah, my precious My prayers have snatched you from death's clutches... ...just to see you again and to hold you in my arms Blood? Oh, unhappy me! I feel faint Lie back, my love I can see the wings of death hovering over me I can feel a cold sweat as my soul escapes from my pierced side But death is sweet indeed... ...if fate decreed that I meet it in your arms Merciful gods, who will help me? Alcina will Is this how you revive my precious love? Look, the lily of love is wilting for lack of dew... But, O God, from what heaven will dew fall? My tears and blood will be enough to revive him, Alcina My power has already revived him Who calls me back to life? His eyes are open Is this true, or am I imagining these heavenly rays You see in them only a crude working of my power I am bound to you in eternal gratitude You breathe again, my soul My heart is full of joy and happiness... ...now I hold you close, heart of my heart You will not enjoy your new found happiness for long, audacious rival! - Orlando! - I am lost! You may thank heaven that you are unarmed Else, with your blood I would... - What would you do? - Don't be afraid Only my charms can serve me now O fleeting happiness You grow pale, you cruel tigress, you deceitful sphinx You do not know, Orlando, the name of this boy who stirs your jealousy He is fair Angelica's brother O heavens, I can breathe again Ungrateful wretch, is this how you insult me... ...and shrink from my love and trust I am confused! My poor feelings! Is this how you repay my love, ungrateful wretch? For this lovely hand, which I humbly clasp You weep for him, my love? I am only pretending If he has offended you, he has offended me Make sure that he repents and asks your forgiveness Forgive me, fair lady! Are you afraid to trust me? Don't you know that my heart is yours... ...that you are my idol? Ah, most beautiful hand It is a token of my pure faith Your beautiful eyes shine with love Their beauty is for you only - Are you still jealous? - No Then be quiet You belong to these eyes, you belong to this breast Truly, you are the object of my love I don't want you to be jealous, You must believe I love you I am yours, my adored one, idol of my heart O, you cruel jealousy, how you do torment me! The archer-god knows no mercy... ...when he poisons a loving heart with jealousy's icy venom But I find true consolation in the knowledge... ...that my fears have stirred compassion in my beloved's heart Innocent boy, you still do not know... ...how many darts love will find to wound a heart The day is still to come when it will colour your thoughts If I had but a single lover, I would b as ordinary as any mortal woman But what does fate bring here? I see an armed knight dismounting from a flying steed He comes this way Thank heavens! At last, Ruggiero, your feet touch the ground... ...if this lovely landscape, this bles Elysium, is indeed the ground Greetings, handsome stranger The heavens have delivered you to me where you honour my kingdom Tell me, kind sir, who are you? I am Ruggiero, but I believe this is heaven before me... ...for all is transformed by celestial beauty Here, where I am queen, my brave Ruggiero, you are lord You honour me too highly Alcina owes a great deal to your name... ...and to his handsome looks Only my Bradamante can equal her gracious beauty He stares at me and talks to himself He will be a new victim to my eyes But my Bradamante is still more beautiful Come into the shade and refresh yourself by these tranquil waters How clear this spring is! Let's taste its pure water I'm leading him to the bait I've never tasted anything more refreshing If the fire of love burned in his heart... ..this water will have extinguished all its ardor How pure is this water... Has it quenched the fire of your thirst, my dear? I am drawing him into my net, little by little It has, Alcina, it has indeed My heart feels free to breathe and to rejoice But this is even more exquisite He's falling into my trap Is this ambrosia, or Jove's nectar? The water awakens a burning desire for me in his heart... ..and erases the image of any other beauty beloved by him How kind you are, sweet lady My eyes have never seen beauty such as yours Only you, my sweet love, can bring peace and comfort to my heart Your lovely eyes are stars by which love guides me into port I search for Ruggiero... ...and find him caught in the snares of this enchantress Unhappy me! Here unobserved I listen and grow jealous Behold, fair lady, the power of your eyes They compel my heart to adore you I am not to blame, my dear, if I dare to adore you I will say that I loved you first and I swear to love you forever - Faithless woman! - What true beauty! Traitor! Is this the fidelity you swore to me? Is this the love you pledged? - And who is she? - I do not know her How wrong I was! I am Olympia - - (I'll lie about my name) - - and that is faithless Bireno He plucked the fairest flower from my breast... ...with a promise of marriage Then he abandoned me Fair lady, cease your suffering - I am Ruggiero (Does he not know me, or is he pretending) - What wicked lies! I know my Ruggiero - he is loving and faithful In her fury she confuses Bireno and Ruggiero Leave her to her madness... Let us go, dear heart I am yours, my life Traitor! Roses and violets love the sun's rays And yet its fierce beams sometimes make them wilt Although my beloved may feel new fire in his heart... ...forever and unchanging he will love my constancy Here comes my Ruggiero Be strong, my heart Star of love, which heralds the break of dawn... ...and guides the dreaded night home to the heavens... Tell me, have you ever seen... ...such faith and beauty in human form as that personified in my beloved? I have never seen a more faithless heart Here is delirious Olympia. Fair lady, cease your lamentations There was a time when I seemed beautiful and charming... ...to the wicked heart in your breast I tell you again, I am not Bireno Look for a moment at these eyes. Do you recognize them, villain? In their fire you see the angry heart of Bradamante Look closely. Look at them, you traitor! I don't recall you! This is the gold ring you gave me as a token of your faith Look at it! O heavens! A veil is torn from my eyes! Bradamante, my bride! Beloved pupils, scornful eyes... Angry stars of love, strike with lightning! Take this ring, Ruggiero, and return to judge afresh Alcina's beauty If you then fall in love with her again... ...I pardon you And I shall go away, seeking no revenge What dark cave, what sunless land can hide my deep remorse? I have betrayed you, Bradamante, my life O tears, wash away the stain of wrongdoing from my heart Console yourself, Ruggiero Just as you see a bright star shine more clearly after a storm... ...so you will see your soul quickly soothed after your wrath An angry squall blows up And the deadly storm with restless waves disturbs both sea and sky But the fearsome, hostile cloud soon vanishes... ...and a tranquil sky appears in the heavens It is by varying its objects that Love renders its joys even sweeter... ...in the fortunate ardour of new attachment What you say may be true, Alcina But it pains my poor heart to see another's delight The light of the sun is everlasting... ...and beauty's rays bring everlasting delight If one man enjoys it, he should not steal from others... ...the sweet pleasure of its enjoyment A faithless woman is a great torment I no longer have the heart to endure your way of spreading your love Poor Astolfo! You can't take it any longer? Then leave! How could I leave you? My chains are too strong Stay then, but be quiet What harsh condition is this you impose upon me? Am I to witness your infidelity and not even be allowed to complain? This is the way, Astolfo, to win my affections Only suffering can one day bring you happiness My future looks very black indeed! I love you, fair lady I love you with the most tender, constant love... ...that ever blazed for another soul And you, you cruel lady... From now on scatter your complaints on the wind Would you like my love? You shall have it But never, never nurture the hope... ...that the fire of your bright eyes alone will inflame my heart You deceive yourself if you believe it you are blind if you cannot see it I will never be satisfied with only one love How much I owe to your love... How much I owe to your devotion, my lovely lady Go, go to Alcina! I am not she Take pity on my heart, so tormented by true repentance I want revenge! Here is an arrow, here is my breast Love has already pierced me with your eyes... ...now let death pierce me with your hand How sweet to die at your dear hands And so you will, cruel man... Die then - in my embrace What bliss to die in your embrace, my sweet, beloved joy of my soul Tell the world of my joy... ...all you trees, shrubs, plants and flowers... ...all you caves, breezes, winds In truth, my heart has won! My faithful Ruggiero has returned to me When a stream swells with flood waters and breaks its banks... ...it pours its waters upon the field and knows no restraint So great is the joy I feel... ...that my heart does likewise and cannot contain such intense pleasure From these rocks? Yes, from these rocks must shine the fire... ...with which Hymen will light a torch... ...to make of our souls one soul But Orlando, O heavens! Have no fear that Orlando will see its flame Put your trust in me... ...and leave me here alone to settle our love's future All the joy of obeying your commands has vanished... ...now that you bid me to leave you The few auspicious moments you'll be away from me... ...will bring eternal happiness to your heart and mine, my love Ah, to part from you makes my heart anxious and sad Far from your beauty I suffer, caught between hope and fear Like an innocent flower that blooms in the meadow... ...so hope blooms in my heart then wilts and dies I know such happiness in loving you... ...but the spirit of love, its faith and constancy... ...seems to languish when I am far from your charms Shining like a bright star, the innocent purity of your trust... ...promises a reward for my love But the cruel thought of our parting makes me fear... ...that this light which shines in my heart will not always burn so bright Here is a true love... There is a gracious heart... Who has ever seen a more blessed love? Where, where did you go, my dearest? Come back, come back, my love... ...and show me your longing or you will see me die at your feet Cruel, clever man, at last you have conquered Above that cliff you see a silver vessel It contains the liquid by which Medea restored youth to feeble Jason I want it Does such a trivial wish merit these sighs? The vessel is guarded constantly A horrible monster makes the spot impregnable I will conquer it Then what fortune will be ours Forever in the flower of youth... ...our tender love will truly last for eternity Ah, sweet hope, how you entice me O God! I love you but I fear for you I love you, and your love inspires such strength in my heart, dearest... ...that I defy any danger I will scale this cliff and slay the fierce monster This precipice, surely death to others, only doubles my strength Monster, where are you? I defy you, come out! Are you afraid to face me? I will spare your life I will not demand your hideous skull or rough skin to adorn my triumph Give me the liquid... ...or I will destroy your frightful la this hideous den... ...and take it by force You are a prisoner of Alcina Prisoner! Who speaks? I have a sword at my side and your words hold no fears for Orlando I can see no way out O proud rocks! Now I understand the silent language of your horrors I am betrayed I see it and know it But I will not yield to this fate Yield, stubborn stones! In vain do you resist the shaking of this mighty arm I have dislodged the marble barrier! Now a faint light enters this gloomy den Most ungrateful Angelica My heart is charged by anger and perspires in righteous fury I will escape, faithless woman... ...and trample your new love with all my scorn and wrath Another rock yields to my great strength The passage is open Orlando escapes the prison of your infamous realm, Alcina... ...to wreak his merciless and unforgettable revenge Let the hills echo with the sound of bold horns And let love delight the soul, to the sound of chaste kisses Here, where soft Zephyr blows... ...and with loving whispers sighs for his beloved breeze With wreathed cups, in tender feeling, we will drink to happiness Great mother Venus! Great god Thespius, great father Liberus, hear their vows O lovely Cytherea... O tender Amor... O loving Liberus... I invoke you as I drink this nuptial cup Sweet is this drink and may it remain so forever... ...for Medoro and me in our eternal embrace Goddess of Hesperus, youthful Idalius... ...divine Semeleus, hear their vows If only those same gods might hear my vows to Ruggiero But now, happy souls, I must leave you Please excuse my anxiety to return to my own love But even as I leave you... ...my unhappy heart wishes you well May their love last forever... ...Angelica and Medoro: True lovers and spouses If only my beloved and I could also know the peace that eludes my heart But I am ruled by a treacherous star... ...and the god of love brings me nothing but anguish I pity her Let us leave her to the pain of her suffering... ...and on these verdant trees let us record our joy, my love Yes, let the tender bark grow around the symbol of our love And may our spirit glow in every kind heart which serves love I shall carve this laurel And I this myrtle Grow, fine trees and flourish... ...and preserve in your bark the sweetness and joy of our love Ah, you lying, faithless, ungrateful woman! Ah, you treacherous, traitorous heart! I shall extinguish the flame of your ill-gotten love Oh heavens, what's this I read? Woe is me! "May their love last forever, Angelica and Medoro "True lovers and spouses" Angelica and Medoro? Lovers and spouses? Alas, this axe strikes a fatal blow to my hope Does my treasure belong to Medoro? Oh, my tears pour forth in springs and streams... No, not enough! In torrents, rivers, seas! Orlando is on fire! Who is Orlando? Orlando is dead! His ungrateful lady has killed him! I am his spirit, which she has severed from him I have only his shadow... ...a poor image of he who placed his faith in love "Here Angelica wed Medoro" Who carved this laurel? My tyrannous lady carved it with her own hand With her own hand she spells out my torment! Lovers and spouses? O gods! Wed to Medoro! Revenge, revenge against love! I have found a way to banish it from my breast... ...drag it from my heart Off with helmet, down with my shield! Off with my armour and my mail! "Here Medoro wed Angelica"? You boastful myrtle! I'd like to strip you of your leaves.. ....crush you to the last branch and tear your roots from the ground! I have a hundred wings upon my back I have two hundred eyes The fury in my heart could enrage a thousand hearts or more! On these wings I'll rise and fly from the plain to the mountain With these eyes I'll watch! With all these hearts I'll sigh Eyes, wings, fury, hearts! Ah, what torment! Lovers and spouses... Angelica... And Medoro! Do you think Orlando is dead? He wishes only an honourable funeral pyre for his corpse... ...and an urn to hold his illustrious ashes Use my winged steed to penetrate the defences of this precipice... ...and the profound depths of this cavern But meanwhile, Ruggiero, we must prepare our vendetta against Alcina Melissa can open that wall of steel so we may enter With you beside me, and our Amazon united with us... ...I do not fear the might... ...of the Stygian gods Where valour fights, hell's fury has no force - Yes, my love, a vendetta - You attempt it in vain What is fixed in the stars cannot fail Even you thirst for blood and have hung a sword by your side Because I alone want the honour of the attack And I alone shall have it! Inside stands the fateful urn... ...which grants that wicked woman eternal power Let us wait until Alcina comes to the temple Then you will see me slaughter the cruel woman I would like to break your bow and extinguish your torch You barbarous tyrant, you god of love! But I threaten Love in vain... ...for it laughs with scorn at my foolish fury If I cannot terrify you, I will terrif the gods of Flegetonte Dreadful gods of Avernus! Go show your frightful plumes in the very depths of hell at my command Fly, why do you delay at my orders? Wicked, evil ones! Tell me of Ruggiero Or I will come to plunder the realms of Acheron - Boastful woman! - But all in vain Alas! Hell is deaf, heaven is deaf What must I do? The spirit of the great sage, Merlin, may tell me Open, wall, and give access to your queen - What wonders! - How stupendous Heavenly spirit, if ever you have heard Alcina's prayers... If her tears have ever moved you to pity, in heaven, where you live... ...then hear her prayers Witness her tears... ...and take pity on her sad heart May love assist you Most beautiful queen... Your Ruggiero has escaped on his winged steed your love and my anger He will be pursued! Ah, what a handsome face Tell me, gracious warrior, what is your name? I am Aldarico Faithless Ruggiero seduced the trustin heart of one of my dear sisters Then the ungrateful wretch abandoned her To erase this shame I pursued Ruggiero to take revenge... I found him, but in vain, for he spread his wings to the breeze... ...while threatening me with death... ...and you with ruin What madness! Alcina's great power is eternal How arrogant! Does he dare to think that he can cause me the slightest despair? A star never lacks the warm rays of the sun... ...and a beautiful lady never lacks an obliging lover I understand her He is blind... ...to the light of your lovely features! Rejoice, my heart You have found another lover However they may be, Aldarico, my features are for you Gracious Iphigenia! Furious Orestes has come to you... He has been exiled from Greece - How wretched! - Has Orlando gone mad? Ah, what is this? This sword is stolen - it belongs to Mars There he is now, at the centre of the moon... ...turning the cards against the ladie He is mad, indeed Trouble lies ahead for you If you don't find a solution... ...everything will fall headlong into ruin Listen, listen... ...and pity me My tale is sad but true This poor love of mine invited a beauty to dance... But then Madame Cruelty and Monsieur Severity- - the sworn enemies of love - - they caused this fine desire - - alas cruel fate! - ...they toyed with this fine desire and it has turned to ashes That is the way of wicked fate! He is completely insane In response to my love's kind invitation... ...Madame Cruelty, with a sullen glance... ...and with a threatening look, replied: "Petit fripon, je ne veux pas!" And Monsieur Severity took my beauty by the hand... ...and with solemn steps... ...and a sinister face... ...left my poor love... ...with a dry mouth This woman may satisfy my love by dancing with me Let us dance, madame, the folly of Orlando! Play! Your wish is my command How has this proud hero lost his senses? Fly, fly, fly! What is flying? It is love that flies! You see Apollo rising after him in fury... ...because of the great outrage... ...inflicted on the honour of his pure Daphne... ...by placing the chaste laurel in abor-del-Io... ...when Angelica wed Medoro The crimson flower dies languishing severed by the passing of the plough - Whose voice is that? - Hush! A loving heart so languishes, too... ...when it lives so far from its beloved It is the cruel lady That faithless woman, my former love... ...who claims to be descended from Amphion Sing a song for her amusement Sing, please, I beg you He is mad. Make him happy, fair lady, by granting his wish Thus may your desire be satisfied Will you sing? I will sing Heaven be praised! What state is even sweeter and more joyous here below... ...than that of a loving heart? Which of life's happy blessings rivals being in the company of love? But a loving heart in exile from its beloved knows no deeper sadness Now I shall have her! Faith, I have caught you Vous voudrez bien un coup me pardonner, Madame la Cruauté Heavens, what is happening? We have her prisoner Now let your stern judgement return to my poor love the stolen beauty What strange madness! Comment, vous donc riez? Ventrebleu la railleuse I will start a mutiny: Ladies, knights, arms and lovers all against your foolish loves - Love, what have you done to him? - Poor soul A pitiless heart My stern judgement will return the stolen beauty Medoro, alas... You have been too ruthless I always felt pity for his torment You lie! You heard the echo This poor scorned love of mine, from which all hope is gone... My poor love tells you, echoing my sorrow: You lie, cruel woman! I do not believe you You are innocent, my poor feelings Wrong and sinful is only the threat... .. which mars your candour and your innocence O weeping springs... O weeping springs, weep until this heart dissolves in tears My loving heart, you are made of diamond... ...if today you are not shattered by my grief No, no, I tell you no! Perhaps you hope to frighten me, you black and dreary shadow? No, no, she is not dead Nero believed that cruelty was dead... ...and having risen from Acheron... ...the beggar wanted me to sing for her But I know very well that she's not dead Whoever rends my heart, flee from me Descend into the Tartarus and seek revenge... ...against a cruel and beauteous Fury A cruel and beauteous Fury? Indeed, all ugly women are Furies But Angelica is a Fury, and still beautiful Angelica? Yes, Angelica She who once swore true love to me But what do I see? It is she! My heart is enraged Angelica, my beloved! Before my very eyes! Villain, you dare to hold her prisoner? I will destroy these bars And what will you do? Fight? You are right, defend yourself He has a hide like Hydra O, love of my heart... I hear her crying! Cruel man, you are no match for my enraged heart I have disarmed him Go, do you still threaten? Your madness, villain, no longer merits my pity When blood flows, rage subsides He has fallen to the ground, dead With his weapons I shatter you, bars of iron My longed-for beauty! How hard she is She must be frozen with fear! Do not fear, my heart Orlando embraces you! What noise! What is it? The walls shake to their foundations! Roofs fly through the air! The ground reels! Perhaps the world is collapsing! I am so tired, so weary! Now that I have rescued my beloved from the iron trap... ...I want to close my eyes in sleep... To sleep as Boreas slept in Orithyia's embrace Woe is me, where can I flee? Where can I hide? I am defeated and despised Unjust heaven! You made me immortal... ...and this gift of yours makes my immortality so harsh... ...for my pain, too, will be eternal My fierce enemy in the arms of sleep! Heaven, in truth you have mercifully opened the way for my revenge My fall is great But my ruin crushes you with me Stop, wicked Alcina! Ruggiero! What do I see? In me you no longer see Ruggiero, but your fiercest persecutor Aldarico, my love... In me behold Bradamante, your greatest enemy! - Let us escape! - But where, my dear? Stand still! - What is happening? - Heavens! Arrest Angelica, and may Alcina perish - Astolfo! - Alas! Where were you, sir? I wept for you, unfortunate victim of her fury She can do nothing against me, for the power of the gods is with me - But Orlando? - He is insane Oh, my torment! Orlando is in the arms of Angelica O God, a light! On the naked earth, naked Orlando Unhappy me, where am I? Who am I? What am I seeking? O gods! Alas, when I look at myself I do not know myself I see only my shame O unjust gods, O fates, O contrary stars! My grief and my disgrace are too harsh I have lost you, wicked Ruggiero In Aldarico I can see my rival It all spells my doom Orlando recovers his senses and I lose the last of my power O unjust gods, O fates, O hostile stars! I shall summon the Furies from the depths of the abyss There I shall ask revenge for my betrayed heart You see, your triumph brings that evil woman's destruction After Alcina is destroyed... ...heaven will preserve my fortunes in love... ...by removing love from my heart Ah, my shame! Enjoy your husband, fair woman And you, youth, enjoy your wife in peace Heaven has joined you with the sweet bonds of love May they be eternal and never slacken... ...and may envious, bitter fate never untie them A wise man is one who learns from his mistakes Fly, cupids, with myrtle and flowers to crown constancy and faith
