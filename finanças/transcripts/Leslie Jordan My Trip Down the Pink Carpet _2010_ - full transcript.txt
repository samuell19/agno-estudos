(upbeat music) (crowd cheering) (applause) - So there I stood, (crowd laughs) backstage at the 2006 Emmy's in a blind panic. The week before, at the Creative Art's Emmys I had been awarded best guest actor in a comedy for my sterling portrayal of Mr. Beverly Leslie (crowd applause) on the hit series Will and Grace where I delivered such zingers as well, well, well Karen Walker, I thought I smelled gin and regret. (audience laughter) Now because of that win I had been asked to become a presenter at the Emmy's. I was to present Best Comedy Writing, Best Comedy Direction with my copresenter Mrs. Cloris Leachman. But the question at hand was where in the world was Cloris? I had been told by the stage manager she had suffered a wardrobe malfunction. Good God, wasn't that the term used for that unfortunate incident involving Janet Jackson? (crowd laughter) Had Mrs. Leachman breasts popped out? The woman was 80 years old. (crowd laughs) No, no, no, no, I was told someone had stepped on the train of her dress and ripped it all the way up the side. Now why anyone in their right mind would wear a dress with a train to this cattle stampede was beyond me but the dress with the train seemed to be the look for the 2006 Emmys. I had yelled hello to Deborah Messing as we were being herded into the Shrine Auditorium. She too was bent over thrashing through waves and waves of netting trying to sort out her train that had been stepped on by some unsuspecting Emmy attendee. Is Mrs. Leachman going to make it in time? I nervously inquired of the stage manager. He looked over my shoulder, he said oh, thank God! Here she comes. I turned around and I spotted Mrs. Leachman parading toward us regally like the Queen of Sheba with a whole passel of wardrobe assistants stapling and sewing. (crowd laughs) The stage manager says "And in 5, 4, 3." I said Mrs. Leachman, Mrs. Leachman I have never used a teleprompter. 30 years in the business, I've never used a teleprompter. I have no idea how it works. Y'all it's like smoke in mirrors, the words just float. (crowd laughs) They just float. I said Mrs. Leachman, I've never used a teleprompter (mumbles) Just do as I do dear, I've won eight of these. (crowd laughs) If I don't have it down pat by now, we're fucked. (crowd laughs) With that she grabbed up the mended part of her dress, she took my hand in hers, and we swept on stage to thunderous, thunderous applause. (crowd cheers) The applause was in honor of Mrs. Leachman's eighth Emmy win. She was now the most decorated actress in Emmy history. She had surpassed Mary Tyler Moore by one. As I stood there and I looked out over the enormous Shrine Auditorium filled with the biggest and the brightest Hollywood had to offer, I thought, oh my gosh my introduction to the magic of Hollywood occurred in a darkened motion picture theater in 1958. My mother took me to see Darby O'Gill and the Little People. (crowd laughs) It starred a very young handsome Sean Connery, he was probably my first crush. My mom said that I stared at the screen wide eyed, I didn't move a muscle, I didn't make a peep for an hour and a half. I was barely four years old. Now on the ride home, this was in the days before little people were strapped into seats, we were just tossed in the back. (crowd laughs) And you hoped for the best. Hold on to them groceries kids, momm's bout to hit a curve. (audience laughs) My mother was surprised when I stood up in the back seat, and I boldly began to belt out the theme song to the movie to the top of my little lungs. ♫ She's my dear, my dear, my darling one ♫ Her eyes are sparkling as the sun ♫ I knew most of the words and what I didn't know I made up. (crowd laughs) Now in 1982, I stepped off a bus... These boxes are a little too big. (crowd laughs) In 1982 I stepped off a bus, it was a real big bus. (laughs along with crowd) I stepped off of a real big bus at the corner of Vine Street and De Longpre downtown Hollywood, California. I had twelve hundred dollars sewn into my underpants, (crowd laughs) I had a tiny suitcase, and I had dreams. I had dreams that were as big as the California sky. See back east in Tennessee where I grew up there's lot of hills, there's lots of foliage, but when I stepped off that bus in Hollywood all I saw was sky. I remember thinking this, this is how big my dreams are. Bless my sweet simple little heart. (crowd laughs) I had no idea what I was up against. Let's bear in mind that 1982 is years before the Ellen Degenere's show (crowd laughs). It's years before Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, Queer as Folk, years and years before Will and Grace. Foremost in my mind, when I stepped off that bus in 1982 was it might not be a good idea to let anybody know that I am homosexual. (crowd laughs) Was that funny? (audience laughter) I'll tell you why it's funny. Because I am, without a doubt, the gayest man I know. (crowd laughs) (crowd cheers) Honey I fell out of the womb and I landed smack dab in my momma's high heels. (crowd laughs) With all due disrespect to the Christian right, ain't none of that choice shit here. (laughter) But you know, in 1982 I was so riddled with internal homophobia, I was so consumed with shame and fear and self doubt. I really felt the need to try and pull it off. My devout Southern Baptist upbringing had left me with beliefs that were impenetrable. At that time in my life Cloris pulled me from my revery. She said "You know dear, I've won eight of these, "but one never forgets the first." I said oh Mrs. Leachman, I take mine everywhere. (laughter) I even sleep with it. The only woman I've ever slept with. Huge laughter. On the first row was Warren Beatty and Annette Bening, there was Seal and Heidi Clum, Stockard Channing, Blythe Danner, Julia Louis Dreyfus, and William Shatner, and on and on, not even to mention the big guns from England Jeremy Irons and Helen Mirren. (crowd laughs) So how did this young man who stepped off the bus in 1982 riddled with internal homophobia become this silver haired, confident, openly gay man who tossed out the line well it's the only woman I've ever slept with without any hesitation. Without one iota of self doubt and certainly without any shame. Well this is my trip down the pink carpet. (applause) These are my stories, and these are my songs. (dance music) Woo! Gay bar music. This is a gay anthem. (crowd cheers) This was a long, long time ago. I believed I was the best little queen in town back then. And she was something mist. We gotta roll up this pink carpet, cause as long as it's out I'm gonna dance. We have important issues to discuss. You're gonna have to cut the music off. I can't help it. Woo! We gotta get started, we could do this silliness forever. Okay stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop! Stop! Where to begin. Early in my career, I was hired to do a two episode arc of a situation comedy called American Dreamer. Now American Dreamer starred Robert Urich and the delightful Carol Cane. I can't for the life of me remember what American Dreamer was about. It was terribly high concept, with Robert Urich delivering long monologues in the dark in a black turtleneck. But I'll tell you what I do remember about American Dreamer. It was the crush I had on Robert Urich. Oh, it was a sophomoric crush going all the way back to the days where he was the hot young tennis pro on Soap. Oh! He was such a dreamboat! (crowd laughs) Okay I know. I know that the term dreamboat is a bit unseemly for a man my age but I'm just gonna admit it right here and now. I am a high school cheerleader stuck in a 53 year old man's body. (crowd laughs) If you were to cut me open, Hannah Montana would jump out. (crowd laughter and applause) Do you know that I still write in my diary nightly? Dear diary, today I met a boy. You would not believe how I gush and simper and carry on. Like most gay men my age I have no earthly idea how to love in a healthy and blessed manner. All I know how to do is obsess. I will stalk your ass. (crowd laughs) And I am so codependent. If you want to know how I am doing at any particular moment in time you gonna have to stick a thermometer up the ass of my current obsession. That will tell you how I'm doing. (crowd laughs) And let me say this, I ain't alone here. (crowd laughs) But who can blame us? When all of those heterosexual guys, red blooded, were in junior high learning the fundamentals of dating, and flirting, and breaking up, and finding healthy ways to deal with all that teenage love shit. Where were we? Where were the queers? (crowd laughs) Well, we were locked within the confines of our big secret. We were hiding out within the recesses of our minds. Sitting on the back row in homeroom creating fantasies in our heads. Oh the crushes I had in the 1960's at Delwood Junior High. All angst ridden, all unrequited. (sighs) One week it'd be the quarterback of our football team. I would sit and stare at the back of his head for hours. I memorized the look of his perfect ears, and how his hair just barely brushed the collar of his button-down oxford cloth shirt. And then I had to endure the torment of watching this chirpy cheerleader. Ready-o, let's go! Two bits, four bits ay, six bits dah! Look out for Dalwood, stand up and holler! (crowd laughs) Had to endure the torment of watching this chirpy cheerleader flirt outrageously with my quarterback. Who did little miss perky breasts think she was? I'd go home, I'd lock myself in my bedroom, and I'd put on Tammy Wynette. (crowd laughs) Because she's the queen of co-dependent anthems. (crowd laughs) ♫ Stand by your man ♫ Give him two arms to cling to ♫ Dear diary, does handsome quarterback plus chirpy cheerleader equal love? (fake sobs) Then I decided I'd show that quarterback a thing or two. I decided I was gonna drop him like a hot potato. I'll turn the tables on him. I decided I'd move onto the cutest boy in the whole school. Oh that cute boy and I had some real good times. It was a a very tumultuous relationship, as I recall correctly, I got pregnant. (crowd laughs) I spent the entire summer locked in my bedroom carrying the bastard lovechild of the cutest boy in the whole school. Dear diary, momma and daddy want to send me away to have the baby. (crowd laughs) (sobs) I won't go! I won't go! It was all made up. (laughter) It was angst ridden, it was unrequited, it was completely made up. Y'all got me off track. (crowd laughs) Oh American dreamer! So on American Dreamer I was hired to play Ralph Short. He was the shortest member of the F.B.I in the history of the F.B.I. He was the kind of man who makes up for his lack of physical stature by strutting around like a bantam rooster. He was a real man's man. Oh honey I was more than a little worried about pulling this one off. (crowd laughter) And to make matters worse, the first day of the shoot the director came up to me, Mr. Jordan, may I have a word Mr. Jordan? Mr. Jordan I want to be very upfront with you. You were not my first choice for this part. I think you're a wonderful actor Mr. Jordan, but you carry... It's a certain kind of baggage (crowd laughter) that I don't think is right for this character. I carry a certain kind of baggage? Well no shit! (crowd laughter) Why tiptoe around the truth? Why don't we just come out and say it? I'm a big fag. I'm a silly simpering nilly Nancy fairy! I'm a little too light in the loafers (crowd laughter), let's just lay the cards on the table, shall we? You dearie, are just a little too gay. Okay so I have issues. Then he laid the porker on me. He said, "But Mr. Jordan, Mr. Jordan not to worry "I'm gonna work with you." Work with me? How? Teach me in five easy lessons how to walk and talk like a man? If this wasn't a recipe for disaster I don't know what was. I have spent a lifetime trying to learn to walk and to talk like a man. When I was in fourth grade my mother bought me a tape recorder. I had to memorize a poem for school, and it was my first tape recorder. Now this is what I recorded. Gather round children, and you shall hear of the midnight ride of Paul Revere. This is what came out, gather round children. (audience laughter) Oh my god I sound just like a girl! Oh I was mortified. I sound like Mrs. Prissy from Gone With the Wind. Mrs. Scarlet! Mrs. Scarlet! Oh yes I have the accent. And I ain't talking bout my Southern accent, it's that gay accent. I open my mouth and 50 yards of purple chiffon just bahh. (audience laughter) I had a friend who was up on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles the other day at a book signing. Mrs. Rue McClanahan was signing her book. (claps) Oh we love Rue! (audience applause) From the Golden Girls. Well Mrs. Rue McClanahan was signing her book, my friend stood in line for hours in that heat. He got up there, he handed Rue his cell phone, he said Mrs. McClanahan, my boyfriends your biggest fan, he couldn't be here today cause he had to work but it's his birthday. Do you mind wishing him a happy birthday? She said why no, I don't mind at all! Hi! (laughs) You know who this is? My friend's boyfriend said Leslie Jordan! (audience laughter) Oh great! So I sound like Prissy from Gone With the Wind with just a little bit of Blanche Devereaux tossed in. When I was in ninth grade there was a telephone number of a pervert being passed around my school. Oh my ears perked right up! (audience laughter) My fascination with perverts began at a very early age. Some girls having a slumber party had stumbled upon this degenerate when they were making prank phone calls. I memorized that number and I ran home with my ears ringing and I dialed him up. Hey. He thought I was a girl! (audience laughter) So I threw caution to the wind and went with it. He would masturbate over the telephone. (wet sound with cheek) (audience laughter) Oh yeah! And ask me very inappropriate questions. What color panties you got on? I told him, I says I don't wear any. (audience laughter) Not even to cheerleader practice. Woah that really got him going! Oh yeah (noise with cheek) Yeah oh yeah! (audience laughter) Does the hair on your head match the hair down there on your little pussy? (gasps) Shocking! (audience laughter) But I rolled with the flow. They're both bright red! (audience laughter) And real bushy! Oh yeah! (noise with cheek) Uhuh yeah, talk to me. Yeah, talk to me. He said, I bet you got some real purdy little titties! Staggering! (audience laughter) The doctor tells me I'm overdeveloped for my age. Oh! Yeah! Talk to me. I stayed on the phone with that pervert for months. (audience laughter) I turned into a dirty little slut. It all came to a head when I dared him to meet me at the soda fountain across from my junior high school. What was going through my head? Had I lost my marbles? I think I just had to put a face to that obscene gravely voice. Well I waited and he never showed up. Of course it's better, I'd had probably ended up in a ditch. (laughs) There's no telling what sort of mischief I'd have gotten into had he showed up. Cause I told him, I said in no uncertain terms, you cannot approach me or speak to me but when nobody's looking I'll lift my skirt and give you a little peak at my bushy red beaver. (audience laughter) And let's don't even get started on my walk. I had a friend one time tell me he said, Leslie you walk like Bette Midler in concert. (audience laughter) With a little bit of Ruth Gordon from Harold and Maude strutting into the funeral parlor tossed in. I was walking down the street one time in Los Angeles, and this homeless guy approached me. I am a freak magnet. There can be 100 people walking down the street, I'm the one Hey buddy, hey hey buddy, hey buddy, hey listen buddy, hey hey, I can tell from your gait that you a one of them (laughs) and you know them kinds always been so good to me. Can you give me a dollar? He could tell from my gait? Now the homeless are weighing in with opinions of my manhood. (audience laughter) Y'all got me so far off track. Oh American Dreamer... (laughs) The set joke on American Dreamer became how in the world are we gonna butch Mr. Jordan up? How are we gonna deal with Mr. Jordan's overt sissy nature? Everybody began to pitch in. Nothing was sacred. I'd be standing like this talking to Carol Kane an electrician would lean over my shoulder say, you know buddy, I believe I'd take a wider stance if I were... (audience laughter) Or I'd be on the telephone bitching to my agent, no I'm not gonna do a five line and under. I'm certainly not going to do it for scale plus 10. Someone would lean in, hey buddy, lower register. (laughs) Or I'd be sitting like this, y'all I have set like this since kindergarten, (audience laughter) when I figured out it's just a lot more comfortable. Somebody from clear across the sound stage, Mr. Jordan, I don't believe I'd sit like that if I was you. Somewhere... (audience laughter) Somewhere along the line during the two week shoot it got ugly. Now I don't know, maybe this director was getting notes from the powers that be, or maybe he just didn't feel like I was giving it my all but I don't think he had any idea what he was up against. He took my arm one day, he said, Mr. Jordan, this is not the road tour of true, you will work with me or not. I had no earthly idea what he was talking about. The road tour of true? (sighs) True, it was a play that was very popular at the time about Truman Capote. Now long before I realized my true nature or what I was, I would see it and I would watch Truman Capote as he lisped to Johnny Carson. And I was fascinated, but deeply repulsed. (audience laughter) Listen, I would have to get up and leave the room, the feelings were so strong. I was afraid I was gonna spit up. And you know it was the same way with Paul Lynde when he was on the Center Square. Let's go to Paul in the center for the block! Paul, what did the Lone Ranger call his sidekick? And Paul Lynde would go, beloved? (audience laughter) Fascinated, but deeply repulsed. You know back then it just seemed so shameful. Now the night that we shot American Dreamer, was in front of a live audience. The audience was on the same level as the actors but now the director is up in a booth calling the camera shots, so when he wants to speak to the actors on the floor he does so through a microphone. Which to me sounded like the voice of God.(audience laughter) Now I had the first line. I was supposed to deliver my line offstage off camera through a bullhorn. The director said action! Open up! It's Ralph Short with the F.B.I. (audience laughter) Open up, or I'm comin in! (audience laughter) Y'all that was huge laughter. That line wasn't supposed to be funny. (audience laughter) Mr. Jordan. Cut! Mr. Jordan, (audience laughter) who is out there? So Carol Kane said to me, Butch it up honey, butch it up. I said alright. (audience laughter) Ralph Short with the F.B.I! He says, who? (audience laughter) Carol Kane said, just butch it up. (growls) Ralph Short! Who? Ralph Short! Could have sworn it was Charles Nelson Reilly. (audience laughter) (jazzy dance music) Gay anthem! Gay anthem! We gotta roll out the pink carpet to celebrate our gayness. We're not prepared. Oh I love this one! Yes ma'am. I remember this one. Here, we got to lay out the carpet. Okay here we go, here we go. Woo! It was the 1970's and disco was king. I was young, I was hung, (audience laughter) and I was adorable! And the more I drank, and the more drugs I did, the more adorable I became. When I was loaded honey I was flat out precious. Back then there were two kinds of gay men, there were queens, and then there were butch queens. Everybody was a queen. Now this is the way you told the difference, on the dance floor this is how the butch queens dance. (audience laughter) Oh please, then they'd walk off the dance floor and light a cigarette. Oh Mary, I'm schvitzing. But this is how the queens danced. Now listen, ya'll pay very close attention to the facial expressions because it's very important. (audience laughter and applause) Oh I was featured at all the gay meccas. Miami, San Francisco, New York city, Cartersville Georgia. I fell in love with a hippie who had a really big dick. He wanted to get back to the land man. What a big mistake! Back to Miami! (audience laughter) I was the one up on the speaker with my tambourine. Yes ma'am, causing talk and suspicion. Hey girl listen I got a Quaalude, here let's split it. Okay no no, chew it up. Because you'll get off faster, chew it up! Wait, wait, wait girl. Here I got some poppers. Phew! Oh look girl! There's a pill I found on the floor! (audience laughter) (audience applause) ♫ I was born in the wagon of a traveling show ♫ Momma had to dance for the money you know ♫ Dear diary, I just worked with an unknown actor named George Clooney, I think he has a real future in this business. Yes ma'am I did 16 episodes of a television series called Bodies of Evidence with Mr. George Clooney. And this was years before he became famous. Oh the crush I had on George Clooney. He knew it too, he had me running myself ragged to do his bidding. (audience laughter) I'm rolling this up so we'll quit all this dancing. We got serious issues to discuss. (audience laughter) I get so tickled when I see George portrayed as the suave, sophisticated lady's man. Oh that's not the George I knew! Yes, George always gets the girl. George gets the girl because he is the class clown. George Clooney has an enormous capacity for happiness and it is infectious. He's so much fun to work with and he's quite the jokester. Now back then when I worked with George I was 23 pounds heavier than I am now. It was before I got sober, so I was bloated from the alcohol. (audience laughter) I looked like a beach ball with arms. Well I went on this low fat diet, and I must have talked about it incessantly as I'm want to do. And it got on George's nerves. He went to the wardrobe department. He said, you know those pants that he wears on the show? Take them out about two inches every day. (audience laughter) So I couldn't figure it out. I'd show up for work... Oh anybody that would listen, I'd say hey hey, I'm on a diet but I'm not losing pounds cause I weigh myself. Well you must inches cause look. (audience laughter) Listen, ya'll by the third day I was cinching my pants with this big ol belt. Oh ya'll, everybody look! Look, look, look! Dear diary, George Clooney played a mean trick on me. (audience laughter) When I accused him of being the culprit he said it wasn't him who did it, it was Mark Harmon. Well my goodness gracious, Mark Harmon works on the sound stage next door, here's what I think. I think George knows I have an even bigger crush on Mark, he is insanely jealous. (audience laughter) I am an aging homosexual who has been blessed with a deep appreciation for beauty. I think that's why queers were put on this earth, to make things pretty. (audience laughter and applause) I love being around beautiful things, and that is why I love to be around Mark Harmon. Y'all he's a walking work of art, and aging beautifully I might add. Now I did a series with Mark Harmon in the early 1990's called Reasonable Doubt. It starred Mark Harmon and the delightful deaf actress Mrs. Marlee Matlin, who showed up one day in a brand new white Mercedes. And the alarm was going woo! Woo! Woo!(audience laughter) Woo! Woo! Marlee! Woo! Woo! What? I said Marlee, your alarm is going woo woo. She goes oh no wonder everybody look at me! (audience laughter) Now to the back of her car she had a brand new license plate, it said DRJB. I said Marlee, Marlee what does DRJB mean? Deaf, rich, Jewish, bitch. (audience laughter) Now the first scene that I shot with Mark Harmon, when I went to work with him I thought I was gonna faint. I mean seldom are we mortals allowed to be in the presence of such a godlike creature. Now our first scene, Mark's character and my character were on a stakeout. Now my character talked incessantly to the point that Mark's character grabs me, throws me to the ground, straddles me, and puts tape over my mouth. So the director said action! Mark grabbed me, oh! (audience laughter) He straddled me. Now before he puts the tape over my mouth I was supposed to have a line. But ya'll I looked up, (audience laughter) and I'm telling you right now his physical beauty rendered me mute. (audience laughter) Nothing would come out. The director said Leslie! Leslie! You have a line! I said I know I do, I'm really sorry. Um, could we go again? (audience laughter) So the director goes action! Mark grabs me, oh! Oh! Oh! So he threw me down. And ya'll I looked up about ready to say my line. But listen, I want ya'll to pay attention on that TV show he does. CNSI, N double A CP, something, (audience laughter) whatever it is. If you'll look below Mark Harmon, I think it's his right eye, there is a tiny little scar, a flaw. Just a little flaw on that flawless face. It was so endearing. I fell desperately in love. The director said Leslie, do you need to talk to the script supervisor? I said no I'm sorry, I know the line. Can we go again? (audience laughter) The director says action! Oh! Oh! So it happened again! The director said Leslie, do we have to do this scene over and over again til you get it right? Well at that moment Mark was straddling me right here. He leaned in and whispered in my ear. He said, I think I know what you're up to. (audience laughter) I was so embarrassed! He knew that I loved being manhandled. (audience laughter) ♫ I might have been born just plain white trash ♫ but Fancy is my name ♫ Dear diary, today I worked with an unknown Australian actor named Paul Hogan. He makes me nervous! (audience laughter) I did a series of Foster's Beer commercials with Paul Hogan way before he got famous for Crocodile Dundee. Did you know he barely spoke to me? (bottle clinking) And when he did... Honey did you drop your bottle? (audience laughter) Or was that your earring? (audience laughter) Ya'll Paul Hogan barely spoke to me. And when he did I could not understand a word he said. Now when he's on camera he enunciates his words, but when he's off camera, you know mate (mumbles) Shrimp on the barbie! I couldn't understand a word he said. See really masculine straight men intimidate me. And Paul Hogan strutted around like he was still out in the Australian bush. I thought any minute he was gonna challenge me to a pissing contest or... (audience laughter) Or make me box a kangaroo. (audience laughter) It was just terrifying. And see, I thought the reason that he is not being very nice to me is cause he's on to me. He knows I'm a queer, that's why he's not being nice to me. Course back then, anybody wasn't nice to me cause they knew I was a queer. There was something else that prayed upon my mind about Paul Hogan. Now listen ya'll, this can not leave this room, okay? (audience laughter) No, I mean it! Before I went to work with Paul Hogan a friend of mine from Sydney Australia said well do you know the rumor about Paul Hogan? Honey he's got a 12 inch weiner. (audience laughter) Well that's huge! I went home and I got out my ruler from elementary school. That is hu... See if my mother was here she'd wash my mouth out with soap. I've been out here maybe 30 minutes I've already made (wet noise with cheek) masturbation noises and said pussy and titty, and now I'm talking about somebody's tallywacker. (audience laughter) I'm gonna just tell ya'll right now my biggest character defect is I like to talk dirty and shock people. I don't know where it comes from. I think it's cause, I don't know maybe cause I'm short. I'm a big showoff. I don't know, maybe I want to leave ya'll with something to remember me by. I been in therapy about it for years. (audience laughter) Do you know when I was in first grade there was this nasty little girl, and she taught me a poem and I just loved it. So every day on recess I would quote this poem for anybody that wanted to listen. Abraham Lincoln, sitting a fence beating his meat with a monkey wrench. (audience laughter) The wrench slipped and it hit him in the balls, he pissed all over his overalls. (laughs) (audience laughter) First grade. Then that nasty little girl, she taught me this other poem. I added this to my repertoire. There once was a lady named Alice, who tried to use dynamite as a phallus. They found her vagina in North Carolina (audience laughter) and her ass was somewhere near Dallas. (audience laughter and applause) First grade! See I didn't know what a phallus was. I didn't know what a vagina was. Still don't. (audience laughter) (audience applause) I just liked the way the words rhymed. And I loved the way it all rolled off my tongue. And it just made a whole lot more sense than what my momma was teaching me. Now I lay my down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take. To die before I wake? What kinda shit is that? (audience laughter) What kinda shit is that to lay on a child? I tell you it's a wonder we're sane. Where are we? I'm so far off track. Oh we hadn't finished with Paul Hogan! Here, when we were shooting that Foster's Beer commercial, Paul Hogan and I had to sit side by side at a bar and we had to drink our Foster's beer. But I couldn't get... Off my mind! (audience laughter) It just prayed upon my mind! It made me terribly tense and out of sorts. And years later when Crocodile Dundee came out I thought I had the inside track. I knew what made that character so cocky! (audience laughter) ♫ And me, I spend a lot of time picking flowers ♫ up on Chocktaw Ridge ♫ And throwing them into the muddy waters ♫ Off of Tallahatchie Bridge ♫ Dear diary, today I booked a series of sake commercials with Boy George. Oh I bet he'll be lots of fun! (audience laughter) Love and tolerance is my coat. (chuckles) I was hired to play a monkey (audience laughter) in a series of Japanese sake commercials with Boy George. I was fully dressed up like a monkey. I was supposed to lead Boy George across the desert on a white horse, he was in full geisha drag sipping sake. Now they took me, Boy George, his entourage, a Japanese film crew of 40 that did not speak a word of English out to the Mojave desert. They hired Rick Baker who is the number one makeup artist in the world. He's won trillions of Oscars for his movie magic. He laid me out, for five hours, stuck straws up my nose so I could breathe, put 40 separate prosthetic pieces on my face make this big (monkey noises) monkey mask. I had big fake uncomfortable monkey teeth, and I had gold spec contact lenses that didn't fit right, (monkey noises) and then I had this great big ol Patti Labelle pump monkey wig. (audience laughter) I was a pump monkey, and then I had on this skin tight little outfit with six foot flags coming out of the back. And all we had to eat was sushi that had been sitting out in the desert sun, I kid you not. Those Japanese, they must have stomachs of iron. I, however, do not. I called my agent in tears to get me out of this unChristian situation! (audience laughter) Then came the ordeal of trying to get Boy George out of his trailer. (monkey noises) (audience laughter) (snorting sound) Now Boy George is very clever, he's very very smart. He's quick but he can be a tad mean spirited. (audience laughter) And he's huge! I was expecting a tiny little dainty ladylike, he's like a football player with a dress on! Trust me, you do not want to mess with her. (audience laughter) When he did finally come barreling out of his dressing room with his kimono on, he was in full geisha drag, he said this kimono is like a cheap hotel! There's no ball room! (audience laughter) Then came the ordeal of trying to get Boy George onto the horse. I'm not getting on a horse! That was not in my contract. No, I'm frightened of horses, I'll go back to London immediately. Well one of his entourage hollered, oh for God's sakes George, be a good fairy and get on the horse! George says I am a good fairy, poof you're a pile of shit! (audience laughter) Now I'm not getting on that horse! But it all came to a thundering conclusion when we were supposed to stand majestically astride a sand-dune with the wind whipping through our hair. Boy George was on the horse, the film crew was a mile away yelling at us through this bull horn, and I was at the end of my tether! (audience laughter) Sand was getting behind the prosthetic pieces. When I moved my face it shredded my skin. Sand was in those monkey teeths, (spits) sand was behind the contact lenses. It was excruciating. (audience laughter) I gotta entertain myself. (mumbles) (audience laughter) It was excruciating, I finally went to Boy George, I tearfully ask him, I said, I don't know what to do. Well, from astride the horse Boy George says, well you know dear I know a little Japanese. I'll teach you a phrase and it will alert the director to your plight. I was more than a little suspicious. (audience laughter) I said well what will I be yelling? He said, well you know dear I'll teach you how to say one more take. That will alert the director to your plight. So he teaches me this Japanese phrase, and yell it over ping ping da da! Well these poor little Japanese, they bow. They turned bright red, and they ran! Well Boy George could not believe the response he was getting, so he egged me on. Yell it to this one, he's friends with the director. Yell it loud, he'll alert the director to your plight. (monkey noises) Ping ping... Do you know what I was yelling? Do you have a big dick? Hey hey, do you have a big dick? (dance music starts) This is a big one. We are not prepared. Big gay anthem, we must celebrate our gayness. (audience laughter) We must roll out the carpet and celebrate. I don't know the words, but neither do the drag queens. (audience laughter) You know this song brings back a memory, shh shh! This song brings back a memory. When I was 17 years old, I decided for my own sanity I had to meet some queers. Now I had heard that somewhere in downtown Chattanooga was a gay bar! And I knew the name of it, the Cross Keys Lounge. So I called information, my heart was beating out of my chest. Oh yes ma'am, I'm here. I'd like the address please and the telephone number (whispers) Cross Keys Lounge. Cross Keys Lounge! I found out it was down on Broad Street in a very unseemly part of town. It was near the old Cadillac club. Now listen honey, there was not a night complete at the Cadillac Club without somebody getting shot, their ear cut off. I borrowed my mother's red Monte Carlo, and I told her that I was going to the public library downtown to do a research paper. Well I drove, I parked across the street from the dubious establishment. I watched a couple of people go in and out. I lost my nerve and went right home. Week later, there I sit, right across the street from Cross Keys Lounge. This time I gathered enough nerve to get out of the car. Oh how I longed to meet some queers. I got scared, got right back in that car, and went home. (audience laughter) Third week, sitting across from the Cross Keys Lounge in my mother's red Monte Carlo. This time I got enough nerve, I got out of the car, I boldly stroll within a block of the front door. (audience laughter) I was hoping against hope that nobody from my church or my school would drive by. My goodness gracious, I was treasurer of the Spanish club! (audience laughter) Plus I was an active member in church at the Young Royal Ambassadors for Christ. It would have spread like wildfire throughout the school. It'd been whispered in every pew, it would have been scandalous. So as I stood there, just gathering up enough nerve to walk into the Cross Keys Lounge I saw this site that will remain in my memory until the day I die. It was two big drunk drag queens staggering down the street. I mean I didn't know what a drag queen was but I knew these were men in dresses and big high hairdos. I was fascinated. Deeply repulsed. (audience laughter) But fascinated, and you know was the mirage sailed closer and closer it began to look like the prowl of an old pirate ship. (audience laughter) All the sudden one of the creatures from the hairspray lagoon she spotted me, she cocked her hand on her hip, she eyed me up and down under about three layers of false eyelashes, she said well I wish you'd look at misfit (mumbles). Ain't it precious? Why it's no bigger than a worn out bar of soap! (audience laughter) What are you doing out on these mean streets, little mister? I thought I was gonna start projectile vomiting. I wanted to run but my legs were so weak and shakey. I couldn't even get my legs to do what I told them to. All the sudden the other one popped in, she said oh sister Sue, I think I know what this ones up to. (audience laughter) I know the look on this ones face, you trying to gather up enough courage to go in that big ol bad gay bar, aren't ya? I said no I'm not. She said, yes you are. I said no I'm not! She said yes you are, I'd know that look anywhere honey. You know why? Baby, we've all been there. Now come on, Mrs. (mumbles) we gotta be good Samaritans, (audience laughter) we gotta get this scared helpless little creature off these big bad streets and into his first gay bar. And with that they got on either side of me, they walked me down the street, and they paraded me right up to the entrance of the Cross Keys Lounge. You know in everybody's life I think that there is a defining moment. It's the moment when you realize that nothing will ever be the same again. For some it's walking down the aisle with a beloved to say I do. For some it's receiving a diploma from some prestigious university. Or maybe perhaps just watching the miraculous birth of a child. Well for me, for young Leslie Jordan, it was the moment I stepped across the threshold of the Cross Keys Lounge my junior year in high school. I think I exhaled for the first time in my life. (audience applause) I thought I was gonna burst into tears. You know why? Because it was at that moment I knew that I was no longer alone. (dance music) (audience applause) (claps) Dear diary, today I booked a situation comedy with a legend! I am gonna be working with Mrs. Faye Dunaway. What a deep of crush I had on Mrs. Faye Dunaway. It was a crush going all the way back to when I was a teenager. I was sitting in a darkened motion picture theater, I was in the throws of all that teenage angst. I was watching Bonnie and Clyde. Mrs. Dunaway's cheekbones, and I was lusting after Warren Beatty. Oh, Warren Beatty in his prime, he was something. But this is about Mrs. Dunaway. (audience laughter) Now Faye Dunaway and I did a situation comedy called It Had to be You. It stared Faye Dunaway and Robert Urich who later tragically died of cancer. But Mrs. Dunaway and I were sitting in the greenroom and we were about to take our places on stage, and all of a sudden she leaned in to me and she said, you know, you remind me a little bit of a very dear friend of mine, Tennessee Williams. (gasps) (audience laughter) I said Mrs. Dunaway, I think I can die now. (audience laughter) You have to understand, when you're a young gay man and you're trying to make your way in the hills of Tennessee and you're drowning in the lies of the Baptist Church, Mrs. Dunaway it was the words of Tennessee Williams that saved my life. See when I discovered Cat on a Hot Tin Roof I saw through the veiled inferences, see I knew what Skipper and Brick had been up to. I knew about Big Daddy and those two aging sisters who owned the best 480 acres west of the Nile River, and see I knew why Brick and Maggie weren't sleeping together. Mrs. Dunaway I knew, and it saved my life. She said well you know Tennessee was the only person that I allowed to call me by my given name, I'm Dorothy Faye. I'm Dorothy Faye Dunaway from the panhandle of Florida. I grew up at the end of a dirt road, Tennessee knew that and he understood. And then she stretched, like langwood cat and she found her light. (audience laughter) (audience applause) She is such an old pro she instinctively found her best lighting, even in an off camera situation. (audience laughter) I knew that magic was afoot. I knew something was about to happen. She said I remember once Tennessee and I (audience laughter) were in the back of a long black stretch limousine and we were gliding through the empty streets of Rome during the noonday siesta, and all the windows of the surrounding villas were shuttered. All of the sudden Tennessee leaned into me, and before my very eyes she became Tennessee Williams sitting in the back of a long black stretch limousine, smoking a cigar. She said Tennessee leaned into me and he said, Oh Faye, behind every one of those shuttered windows is a dead body. (audience laughter) She held my gaze for what seemed like an eternity. She just stared and stared, finally I said and his point was? (audience laughter) She raised that eyebrow just like she did in Mommy Dearest as if to say I think you know. She gracefully lifted herself to her feet and she sauntered off without looking back. (laughs) Well what in the hell was that all about? (audience laughter) I have pondered on those words for years. Was she trying to regale me with something, or was she just telling me a story? I tell you what I settled on, maybe just maybe, we were in the green room see, we were ready to take our act out on the stage. So maybe just maybe those words of Tennessee Williams, she was trying to impart some wisdom to me, the mother superior to the young supplicant. So maybe those words, Faye behind every one of those windows is a dead body meant that behind every shuttered window is a skeleton, there's a story to be told. Everyone has a story. And maybe she was trying to tell that as thespians it was up to us to use our God-given instruments to the best of our ability to tell the story. Then again maybe she's just nuts! (audience laughter and applause) Dear diary, Today I was sent on a mission from God to buy underpants for Mrs. Beverly D'Angelo. Y'all it's true. All my life I have been a Pasty Cline freak. I thought Mrs. Beverly D'Angelo's portrayal of Patsy Cline in Coal Miner's Daughter was breathtaking. I've seen that movie 100 times. Now my friend, we love Beverly D'Angelo, my friend Dal Shores, who wrote Sorted Lives, had written this movie called Daddy's Dyin Whose Got the Will? He called me up, he said, you're never gonna believe who we have cast in one of the lead roles. I says who, he said Beverly D'Angelo. I screamed and locked myself in the bathroom. (screams) (audience laughter) I do that a lot. But you know how we are. You know gay men my age we have what I call the Marilyn Monroe syndrome. We love to fall apart. We love to scream and lock ourselves in the bathroom. We love to cry and take pills. (screams) Carry on, just fall apart. (audience laughter) Anyway, this movie was being shot in a little town called Drop Texas, D R O P. There's Dallas and then as you leave Dallas there's Denton, then there's Ponder, home of the famous Ponder Steakhouse, and then there's Krum, little town, K R U M, and then there's Drop. It's about seven miles from where Kraust lost his shoes. (audience laughter) So I... Ya'll like that one? That's up there with my grandmother. I would pout when I was a little boy and she'd say ya'll look at that Leslie. Son I could write the lord's prayer on your lip with a mop. (audience laughter) Where were we? Oh Beverly D'Angelo. So I finagled my way out to the set and I was standing there watching them rehearse in this old ranch house and I was thinking of every way I could just to get in with Beverly D'Angelo. So finally they took a break from their rehearsing, and I said hey everybody! I'm gonna drive into the galleria in Dallas, if anybody needs anything. Beverly D'Angelo came running over in front of everybody she said honey you mind picking me up some panties? I packed so quick I forgot my underwear. I almost shit and fell back in it. (audience laughter) I said Mrs. D'Angelo, I do not mind buying you underpants but I have to tell you I know nothing about women's underwear. She said oh honey I'm easy to please, it's a size four. And listen, they got to be cotton crotch. (audience laughter) So she took my hand, she said come in here I'll give you some money. So she took me in her dressing room, she's rifling through her bag. She says now listen, it's really a size six. (audience laughter) But now don't forget, cotton crotch. So I'm on my way to Dallas with a crumpled 100 dollar bill in this hand and I'm repeating my instructions over and over cause I'm so afraid I was gonna forget them. It was like I was on a mission from God. Size six, cotton crotch. (audience laughter) Size six, cotton crotch. Well, I got to the galleria and there was Victoria's Secret. And you must understand this was almost probably 20, 25 years ago. Now back then, when Victoria's Secret first came out it was high end lingerie. Now you know it's all those butt floss panties and bras, nipples cut off, just trash. (audience laughter) But back then, high end lingerie. So I thought this is where you'd buy panties for a movie star. Well I walked in and there was this real thin impossibly sheek older woman folding underpants and she's peering at me over her half-moon reading glasses like a whooping crane. (audience laughter) You know the kind of woman. When she farts only dogs can hear it. (audience laughter) (squeaking noise) And she talks like all those actresses from the 1940's that were given elocution lessons by the studios. She said, may I help you? I was so nervous, my voice cracked. I said yes ma'am, I'd like to buy some panties. (audience laughter) She goes like this. Ya'll she way she was looking at me I think she thought I was buying those panties for myself. I said they're for my wife. (audience laughter) Yes, well what size panties does your wife wear? Size six, cotton crotch. (audience laughter) She says to me, well all our panties are cotton crotch. Please follow me, I'll show you our vast selection. So I follow Mrs. Sand in her vagina. (audience laughter) She steers me to some panties in bright trashy colors. Now listen, I grew up in a house where the four things were always white. Bed sheets, bath towels, toilet tissue, and paper towels for the kitchen, white! So I just naturally assumed that panties should be white. So I bought four pair of bikini cut panties for Mrs. Beverly D'Angelo, mission complete. Well I got back and Beverly I bonded over the panties. I told her all about Mrs. Sand in her vagina, and oh well we laughed and laughed. Well about a week later, Beverly has this lovely assistant named Mela who does her hair and travels everywhere with her. And so Mela and I would do our laundry down the street from the hotel because we didn't want to pay those exorbitant prices. And I saw Mela loading those panties that I bought for Beverly into the washing machine. I said do you do her laundry? She said what? And I said those panties. She said oh those? No, Beverly gave me those. Somebody bought them for her but they bought the wrong size, they were way too small. Uh uh. (audience laughter) Uh uh. Size six, cotton crotch. So that afternoon I went up to Beverly and I said hey Beverly listen, if I ever get famous enough to get on Johnny Carson, I got a real funny story I'm gonna tell. It's gonna be about the time I was sent to buy underpants for Beverly D'Angelo. In front of everybody she told me a four, then she pulled me in her dressing room and told me it's really a six. And I bought a size six and those were too small for her fat ass! (audience laughter) She said honey I'm proud of my fat ass. I never wanted to be a little bony celebritant. But that afternoon it was so funny. At first she said to me, you better not tell that story, I'll never speak to you. Well then that afternoon she said come here I need to speak to you. (audience laughter) She said sit down. She said I've been thinking a little bit about this panty story. (audience laughter) She said I think you're pretty funny, you might end up Carson, so I'm gonna give you permission to use the panty story but listen, I want you to begin at a size two. (audience laughter) I pull you into the dressing room and I tell you a four, you buy a size four, and they were a little too snug. (audience laughter) You got it? That is the story that goes on Carson. (audience applause) (piano music) Not a word is needed, not a word is needed. We must celebrate our gayness, we must roll out the carpet. Boom! Oh it's upside down! It was supposed to work right on the cue. Ya'll I am flat worn out. (laughs) (audience applause) I hope ya'll appreciate... Listen I'm gonna have to rest just for a minute. Ya'll just talk amongst yourselves (audience laughter) cause I... I'm like Pavlov's dog, I heard that disco thump I gotta go with it. What are you trying to do, kill me? (audience laughter) (audience applause) Every time I hear this song it reminds me, I got sober in 1997, and if you had asked me... (crowd applauds) Well thank you! Maybe we'll all go have a drink after the show! (cheers) But in 1997 if you had asked me, are you openly gay Leslie? Are you a proud gay man? I'd say honey I've ridden down the middle of Santa Monica Boulevard half naked on a gay pride float strung out on crystal. (cheers) We're here, we're queer, out of the closets and into the streets. Hey Miss Thing, (cheers) hey girl! Proud to be gay! Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay! Well, in 1997 at the age of 42 my medicine was taken away. Yay. (crowd laughter) (whispers) Gay pride. The weirdest thing happened, I found myself when my medicine was taken away completely riddled with internal homophobia. It was almost as if all that shame, all that fear, all that guilt, had been suppressed over the years with all of this drugs and alcohol. See when I was 14 years old, that's when I started realize I was gay. That's when I first started drinking. I figured out real quick, honey it's just a lot easier to be gay when you're drunk (crowd laughter) or loaded. So I stayed drunk and loaded for about 33 years. I mean what was the problem? (crowd laughter) Well, they sent me to rehab and I did not have a chance to say no no no. (crowd laughter) (laughs) They said oh yes, yes, yes. So I end up rehab and my counselor was this big ol nilly Mexican queen, you know the type. (crowd laughter) She said, you know girl, jou, jou are a fag hating fag. That's what you are girl. (crowd laughter) I said no, no wait a minute. I'm not a fag hating fag. I don't like nilly fags. But she says hello. (crowd laughter) See, when we see something in somebody else that we don't like and the finger pointing starts they teach us in recovery there's three fingers pointing back at you. See if there's something that you don't like about somebody else, you might want to take a little look at yourself. I hated being a sissy. I have been a sissy my entire life. I cannot tell you the shame attached to that issue. When I was in my early 20's and really drinking and doing a lot of drugs I lived in this apartment where there were no mirrors. Could not stand to look at myself. I even busted the mirror out in the bathroom in a drunken rage because I caught myself shaving with my pinkie out. (audience laughter) You're such a fag you can't even shave like a man! Well my counselor in rehab made a very astute judgement. He said, Leslie it seems from hearing your story that your greatest fear in life is groups of heterosexual men. I said well, no shit. Wasn't exactly a picnic during dodgeball. (audience laughs) You may not remember that ball that was the color of dried blood, but I do. You may not remember that big redneck who would holler smear the queer! And then you didn't have to go (screams) tapdance or get creamed. (audience laughs) I have this fantasy. I'm going home in July for my 35th high school reunion. I'm gonna find (audience applause) I'm gonna find that guy. You know there was always that one that just tormented us, remember girls? (audience laughter) I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna say hey remember me? Smear the queer! I'm gonna say listen, you know because of you I learned to be funny. Because I did. I learned at a very early age that if I could make the bullies laugh I could keep them at bay. So I'm gonna tell him I learned to be funny because of you. And I've had a very lucrative career being funny, so I want to thank you. But I would also like to tell you to kiss my rich sober gay ass. (crowd applause) Mother fucker! (crowd cheering) So this counselor of mine in rehab, he highly suggested, and if any of you are in recovery you know you better fucking do it when they ask... (audience laughter) He wanted me to join an all male stag recovery group. I thought were my bowels were sure to let go. I mean the thought of walking into a room with groups of masculine heterosexual men, especially a room where you're supposed to share your innermost secrets, my stomach just began doing backflips. But thank goodness I just did as I was told. I joined an all male stag recovery group. Now the first night I walked into the meeting and I'm telling you, you could cut the testosterone with a knife. It was that slap on the back, crotch grabbing, spitting on the floor, kind of masculinity that has always alluded me. It terrifies me. I'm real attracted to it but... (audience laughter) We're not gonna go down that road cause we would never find our way back. But you know when I walked into that room my first thought was oh my God I should have left my murse in the car. (audience laughter) For those of you not in the know, a murse is a male purse. Now a lot of straight guys, they carry bags but I think it's something in the way that it is carried that makes it a murse. So as if that I left my murse in the car (laughs) they would have had no idea. (audience laughter) I woulda fit right in. So I walked in with my murse and I found a seat. And early in sobriety I shook, oh I shook. I don't know my blood sugar level, I don't know but I shook. It was very embarrassing and I was shaking like a little chihuahua. (audience laughter) I remember I held on to the side of the chair just to keep me from shaking and we went around the room introducing ourselves and I did this trick that I'm sure none of you have ever tried. I lowered my voice. (audience laughter) Hello my name is Leslie and uh I'm a... Oh honey, they were on to me. (laughs) So near the end of the meeting the leader called upon me to share. Now to share you had to walk to the podium up some steps. All I could remember was I had heard this really funny story in my gay recovery group that week. This big queen, and honey I do mean queen, she made me look like a Hell's Angel. (audience laughter) She's a big ol piano playing queen, you know the type. (audience laughter) She told this funny story. She said, he said that when he was early in sobriety he had to share at an all straight meeting and so he called his sponsor, that's his spiritual advisor, and he said listen I've gotta share at an all straight meeting, do you think I should just tell them right off the bat that I'm gay? His sponsor said honey, you gotta walk to the podium (audience laughter) they're gonna know! (laughs) Oh ya'll, see I told you these boxes were too big. Do you know that this is supposed to be my podium? (audience laughter) I'm just a little sober floating head. (audience laughter) I think those five steps that I took from my seat to that podium were the longest five steps of my life. But as I stood there looking out over the enemy, this sea of masculine heterosexual men, something really really cathartic happened. It was almost like I instinctively knew that this was the jumping off point. It was like when I was a kid and I'd go to the swimming pool in the summertime and I would stare at that high board. Oh I wanted to jump off that high board! I finally got up there and I looked down, I thought I can't do it, but what was the alternative? You had to make all the kid back down the ladder. (audience laughter) And that just couldn't happen so it was sink or swim, it was do or die. Hello, my name is Leslie and I'm an alcoholic. I'm also a recovering drug addict. But more importantly to me and my sobriety, I think I need to say this out loud. I am a homosexual. I was waiting for that one smart aleck in the back. You know, no shit! (audience laughter) But the room was deathly quiet so I forged on. I said I am scared to death of you guys. I'm scared that you'll be disgusted by me, I'm scared that you'll make fun of me behind my back and I am really really afraid that you're gonna shun me. But I was given instructions to join this group and I'm too scared right now to not take instructions. So I guess this is what you call a surrender. For the first time in my life, I told the truth. After that meeting the unconditional love in that room was overwhelming. That night I became a part of something really really important. It's not like we went out and bird dogged chicks together. (audience laughter) I sort of became the meeting mascot. You know the little meeting queer. (audience laughter) Listen, I became an integral part of that group. I never missed a meeting for four years. Before I joined that group I was under the mistaken impression that heterosexual men had no fear and no shame. See I thought that gay men had the corner on that one. Ladies, the emotional landscape of the heterosexual male is a minefield (audience laughter) of fear and shame. Gay people do not have the corner on that one. I would sit in that meeting and I would watch these big masculine heterosexual men stand at the podium sometimes with tears streaming down their faces talking about their fear and their shame and it was beautiful. It was so beautiful that sometimes I'd forget to breathe. And one time I hyperventilated and I thought I was gonna faint and I thought oh great, well there he goes, meeting queer. (audience laughter) Hey you boys help him up, you over there get his murse. (audience laughter) But you know, most importantly those men taught me what it means to be a man. My dad was killed in a plane crash when I was 11 years old. He was a career army man. He was a man's man. And I was haunted for years and years and years with the feeling that I had been somewhat of a disappointment to him. And it was almost like I had been in this weird holding pattern waiting for somebody to take up the slack. And at 42 years of age, those men took up the slack. One of them came up to me one time and was so sweet. He had this card that he had had laminated, and on the card it said what you think of me, is none of my business. He said Leslie I think you should carry this in your wallet. See those men taught me that it matters little that I never learned to walk and to talk like a man. See they taught me that a man has to have a code in which to live their life by. They gave me this code, it's a code that's based upon love and tolerance. And they taught me that it matters little that I can't lift weight, or I haven't bedded 100's of women, or that I can't throw that football. As long as I remain true to my code those men taught me I am a man. (audience applause) I read this magazine article recently that talked about that there are two kinds of gay people in America today. There are the fabulous, and there are the fearful. See those of us who have found our place on the pink carpet, we found our tribe. We're comfortable in our skin with who we are and what we are. We are the fabulous ones. But we forget that there are still gay people who are deathly afraid of someone finding out, they're afraid of what might happen especially our gay youth. Do you know that gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender kids are three times more likely to commit suicide than their straight counterparts. I've been very involved for the last ten years with an organization called The Trevor Project. It's a suicidal hotline for gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and questioning youth. When the Trevor Project plugged in ten years ago within the first five months they were overwhelmed with almost 15,000 calls. Beautiful young gay men, beautiful young gay women who were thinking about suicide. And do you know where the majority of those calls came from? The bible belt. It breaks my heart. I try really hard to live a life of attraction and not promotion but I think a lot about that young gay man, that young gay woman, perhaps out in our hinterland, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling awash with feelings of shame and fear and self loathing and wondering what so many of us wondered, if there's a God who loves queers. I want that young gay man, that young gay woman, to know my journey to this pink carpet tonight has taught me that there is a God who loves me unconditionally. I want that young gay man, that young gay woman, to know that I have a God who looks down with fatherly pride upon his handiwork and he rejoices that I am who I am and what I am. I want that young gay man, that young gay woman to know our history. I want them to know about our struggle. I want them to know how many we buried. I want them to know how hard we worked to earn the right just to walk down the street and hold hands with someone that we love. I want that young gay man, that young gay woman to know my convoluted tale for what it's worth. My trip down the pink carpet, because these are our stories, and these are our songs. (dance music) (audience applause) Oh thank you. Thank you! Love me some Atlanta! What's this? Oh! Oh look! What is this? Oh look! It's my book! Oh what's this? Oh dear wait wait wait, what is this? Oh! (crowd laughter) Ya'll we'll be signing books. I got some signed books out there. Thank you so much, I love ya'll so much. (applause)
