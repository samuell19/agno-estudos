Announcer: ...comes back with a biting right hook. Spinner's hurt. He staggers back. Horn's on him again. ( speaking alien language ) Announcer: He got him! Horn Horn Horn! ( speaking alien language ) Announcer: ...better opponent than this. Horn, the six-time undefeated champion is giving Spinner the beating of his life. It's hard to believe the once unbeatable Spinner could look so terrible. ( crowd cheering ) UPPER CUT, SPINNER. COME ON. MOVE MOVE. KEEP MOVING. ( grunting ) Announcer: Spinner, the once impressive contender, is simply no match for the six-time champion Horn. Spinner is just a pathetic shadow of his former self. And the crowd doesn't like it. Horn is relentless. He won't let up. He's already broken a record... - THREE, FIVE AND A SEVEN. - LET'S HAVE A THREE, FIVE AND A SEVEN. HUSTLE, ROOKIE! COMING UP, COMING UP. HOLD YOUR THRUSTERS. ( crowd booing ) Man: YOU BETTER GET BACK TO THE SCRAP HEAP, PAL! - LET'S HAVE A THREE, FIVE AND A SEVEN. - NO PROBLEM! BE RIGHT WITH YOU. YES, WHERE'S THAT FIVE? HIT HIM IN THE RIBCAGE. COME ON, RIBCAGE, SPINNER. ( buzzer sounds ) - Woman: Score point to Horn. - Horn: HORN! Scoring now stands: Horn two, Spinner zero. HORN! Announcer: Should he be allowed to go another round? And what about Horn? A champion, yes. A crowd pleaser, absolutely. But is he a sportsman? To that I say no. Woman: In order to balance strength between species, the Arena uses the Seiko 3000 handicapping system. The handicappers decrease a fighter's strength keeping the match competitive with the fighters evenly classed. Horn is fighting at a disadvantage rating of .25 krell ( beeps ) - HOW'S IT GOING, SPINNER? - NEXT ROUND IS MINE. WHAT DO YOU THINK? CAN YOU GO ANOTHER POINT? HE'S LOST A LOT OF HYDROLENE FLUID. - I MEAN, I CAN REPLACE-- - IF IT'S THE ONLY WAY, JUST DO IT. OKAY, BOSS. ( beeps ) WEEZIL? ( wheezing alien language ) ( cackling ) WEEZIL, WHERE ARE YOU? - Weezil? - RIGHT HERE, MR. ROGOR. Listen to me. Do it. RIGHT AWAY, SIR. HERE YOU ARE. RIGHT, MAY I HELP YOU? HEY, WHERE'S MY SEVEN? I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN. HEY, ROOKIE, WHERE'S THAT SEVEN? - WHAT ARE YOU DOING? - OH, SLUDGE! ( whispering ) RIGHT ARM. DON'T LET THEM SEE. Woman: Five seconds... I'LL KILL THAT SON OF A JUNKYARD BITCH. COMING UP, COMING UP, COMING UP. - HERE, HERE YOU GO. - HEY, SPEED IT UP, SLAG. I'VE ONLY GOT FOUR HANDS! ( screams ) ( buzzer sounds ) Woman: Point and match to Horn. - ( audience screaming ) - OUT OF MY WAY! I'LL KILL YOU! GET HIM OFF HIM! WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? Woman: Please remain seated. There is no cause for alarm. Crowd control unit 105, please report to grandstand section 42 immediately. QUINN, CALL SECURITY. QUICK! - I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. WHERE'S THE COMMISSIONER? - QUINN, I'M TRYING-- Commissioner Dent to the red com line please. ( screaming ) QUINN! NOW LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING: WE DID NOT LOSE. WE WERE VICTIMIZED. Horn is an animal who should not be allowed in the ring. Reporter: Do you plan to file a formal complaint for the commission? Quinn: Commission? What commission? Where is Commissioner Dent anyway? When is he gonna start outlawing this kind of brutality? Alien: COME ON, COME ON. LISTEN, NEBULITE, WE'RE NOT WAITING FOREVER. HEY, YOU WANNA EAT THIS FOOD OR WEAR IT? YOU CAN'T TALK TO US THAT WAY. DAD! WE MISSED THAT K.O. BECAUSE OF THIS FREAK. FREAK? LISTEN TO ME, YOU LITTLE TADPOLE. YOU ARE A VERY RUDE YOUNG MAN. HEY! HEY, NO NO NO! - HEY, I DIDN'T MEAN IT! - LEAVE HIM ALONE! YOU KNOW, WHERE I COME FROM, WE TEACH OUR KIDS MANNERS. LAST TIME I SAW A FACE LIKE THAT, IT HAD A HOOK IN IT. - ( laughs ) - EARTHLING, HUH? ( woman screams ) Woman: IS HE OKAY? YEAH, WHAT A FIGHT. Woman on P.A.: Attention snack bar 21 personnel. You are in violation of your service contracts. Employment is terminated. HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - I FOUND OUT ONE THING, SHORTY. - WHAT'S THAT? I'M NOT CUT OUT TO BE A SHORT-ORDER COOK. WHO WAS? YOU ALL RIGHT? CAN YOU HEAR US? DID YOU SEE THE WAY HE HIT VANG? ( dings ) SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED BACK THERE. YOU DIDN'T PUNCH ANYBODY. FORGET IT. YEAH, BUT IF I HADN'T SHOT MY BIG MOUTH OFF-- TALKING IS NO CRIME. FORGET ABOUT IT. - I CAN'T FORGET ABOUT IT. I'M A NEBULITE. - SO? WHAT, WERE YOU CLONED YESTERDAY? A NEBULITE NEVER FORGETS. HONOR DEMANDS I REPAY THE FAVOR. NO, JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, WILL YOU? WAIT A MINUTE. YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND. YOU MAY NEED MY HELP. WITHOUT A JOB ON THE STAR STATION, YOU COULD BE DEPORTED FOR VAGRANCY. - HEY, SHUT UP! - ( grunts ) SHORTY, THAT WOULD SUIT ME JUST FINE. I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THIS STAR STATION. I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO EARTH. THEN I'LL PAY YOU BACK BY HELPING YOU GET THERE. Woman: Invalid entry. Please check with a crib-tender. - WHAT NOW? - WHAT'S WRONG? - I said invalid entry. - I DON'T KNOW. EXCUSE ME. MY KEY-- IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE WORKING. YOUR CRIB HAS BEEN FOLDED. FOR WHAT? FOLDED FOR WHAT? YOU LOST YOUR JOB AND WE NEVER GOT THE REST OF YOUR DEPOSIT. - NO, WAIT A MINUTE. - SORRY. ( laughs ) WHERE IN THE HELL AM I SUPPOSED TO SLEEP NOW? I GOT A PLACE. COME ON. TRY BYPASSING THE E.D. SYSTEM COMPLETELY. ALL RIGHT, HAND ME THE SPOT WELD. TRY IT NOW. NO, IT AIN'T GONNA WORK. WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK? CAN'T YOU FIX ME? Wayne: THE L-3 ARM IS TOTALLY SHOT. THE INTEROCITOR UNIT AND THE MAGNA THRUSTER'S COMPLETELY BURNED OUT. SORRY, KID, BUT I'M AFRAID YOUR FIGHTING DAYS ARE OVER. - NO! - HEY, COME ON. ALL HE NEEDS IS A MICRO-RELAY. YEAH, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH THAT COSTS? DON'T RETIRE ME. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, SPINNER. WE'RE NOT GONNA GIVE UP ON YOU YET, OKAY? RIGHT? OKAY. MAYBE WHEN VANG TAKES THE QUARTER-FINALS, WE'LL HAVE THE MONEY. QUINN. VANG, WHAT HAPPENED? AN EARTHLING, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED. ( sighs ) LOOK, WHY SHOULD YOU SLEEP ON THE FLOOR WHEN I'VE GOT A PERFECTLY GOOD PLACE? DON'T BE CRAZY. Woman: ...will be departing from outer platform space lock B due to repairs on space lock A. All freighters will depart from outer platform space lock M until further notice. OKAY, HERE WE ARE. - IN THERE? - UH-HUH. I WOULDN'T WANNA PUT YOU OUT, SHORTY. HEY, AFTER WHAT YOU DID FOR ME...

I OWE YOU, REMEMBER? LET'S CONSIDER THIS YOUR WAY OF REPAYING ME IN FULL. NO NO, I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU GET AWAY WITH LETTING ME OFF THAT EASY. ( sighs ) THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF. LET'S GO, ROOKIE.

THAT WAS, WHAT, 50 YEARS AGO? ALL THOSE GUYS WERE CONTENDERS. THAT WAS WHEN THE GAME MEANT SOMETHING. NOW IT MEANS NOTHING. - OH. - I WISH I COULD HAVE BEEN A PART OF IT. - WHAT MAKES YOU SUCH AN EXPERT, ROOK? - ARE YOU KIDDING? I'VE SEEN EVERY SINGLE ONE OF MARCUS'S FIGHTS ON RETRANSMISSION. IT WAS STILL A SPORT WHEN HE FOUGHT. THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LOOKING AND FIGHTING, ROOKIE. NO, WAIT A SECOND. THERE'S SOMETHING YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME. - I AM A FIGHTER. - UH-HUH. I FOUGHT ON THE HUMAN CIRCUIT. I WAS RANKED. - I WON A LOT OF FIGHTS. - HMM. I HAD THIS DREAM THAT ONE DAY, I COULD COME UP HERE AND FIGHT IN THE ARENA. THERE'S JUST NO ROOM FOR REAL FIGHTERS UP HERE ANYMORE. AT LEAST, NOT FOR HUMANS, THAT'S FOR SURE. THIS WAY. I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT, SHORTY. YOU'VE GOT A JOB. WHY DO YOU LIVE DOWN HERE? ( chuckles ) I HAD A JOB, AND I SEND ALL MY MONEY HOME TO MY FAMILY ON NEBULAR. SO YOU'RE A FAMILY MAN FROM NEBULAR. - EXACTLY. - HOW MANY KIDS YOU GOT? - 27. - 27? ( laughs ) HOLD IT. I LOCKED THIS.

BUT I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE-- I MEAN, AN EARTHLING WHO CAN FIGHT. YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THE ARENAS, STEVE? AW, COME ON, BOSS. IT AIN'T GONNA WORK.

For the first time in 50 years, not since Marcus was the king, will a human do battle in the arena. ( growling ) MR. ROGOR, LOOK. IT'S THE EARTH GUY. Woman: Arena fans, coming up next on the card will be a two-point match. THAT'S HOW HE GOT ALL THAT KRUGER. THE LAD'S A FIGHTER.

( laughing ) OKAY, CLEAR YOUR HEAD, KID. LOOK, YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE? - WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME A HINT? - NOT FUNNY, OKAY? IF YOU LOSE THIS ONE, THERE WON'T BE ANOTHER HUMAN CHAMPION FOR 50 YEARS. WELL, THAT'S REAL ENCOURAGING, QUINN. LOOK, JUST GO OUT THERE AND TAKE CONTROL, OKAY? WHATEVER YOU DID TO VANG, GO DO IT TO SLOTH, OKAY? RIGHT, WHEN YOU GOT INSIDE ON HIM, HE GOT REAL DEFENSIVE.

COME ON, BEST SHOT. - COME ON! - THE OLD SENSOR NERVE, YES! TAKE THAT AND THAT! ANNIHILATE HIM. HEY, WE GOTTA STOP IT. HE'S BREAKING HIS NECK. ARE YOU CRAZY? THIS IS AN ARENA MATCH. HE'S STILL GOT A CHANCE. - I'M GONNA CALL THE FIGHT. - YEAH. YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT. ( groaning ) YEAH YEAH! GET HIM, KID! GET HIM, KID! - FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT! - HIT HIM! WHERE DID HE GO? - ( buzzer sounds ) - Shorty: YEAH, BOY! Ladies and gentlemen, never in my long and brilliant career have I seen such an astonishing debut, such a display of guts, poise and talent, not only a rookie, but an Earthman. Now could this be the contender that the Humanoid races have awaited all these years? - HOW DO I LOOK? - YOU OUGHT TO SEE THE OTHER GUY. YOU LOOKED GOOD OUT THERE TONIGHT, KID. I FELT FANTASTIC, SHORTY. IT WAS A LITTLE BIT AWKWARD AT FIRST, BUT AFTER THE FIRST COUPLE OF BLOWS THE ADRENALINE TAKES OVER. IT'S THE EXCITEMENT OF THE ARENA. IT'S LIKE NOTHING I EVER FELT BEFORE. WELL, NOW YOU WANNA GIVE IT ALL UP AND GO BACK TO EARTH, RIGHT? SHORTY, I DID THAT TO GET YOU OUT OF THE JAM WITH THE TICKET MONEY. YEAH, I KNOW, BUT YOU HAD HIM-- - YOU, OUT. - HE STAYS. SO, ARMSTRONG... YOU'RE FULL OF SURPRISES, AREN'T YOU? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, ROGOR? YOU DIDN'T TELL ME YOU WERE A FIGHTER. I DIDN'T KNOW I HAD TO TELL YOU I WAS A FIGHTER. IT'S A GOOD IDEA. RIGHT, MR. ROGOR? LEFT SHOULDER, SHORTY. IT'S A LITTLE STIFF. YOU WERE VERY IMPRESSIVE OUT THERE TONIGHT. YOU COULD GO RIGHT TO THE TOP WITH THE RIGHT MANAGEMENT. - I SIGNED WITH QUINN. - ( chuckles ) I SAID WITH THE RIGHT MANAGEMENT. ASK AROUND. NOBODY GETS TO THE CHAMPIONSHIP CIRCUIT WITHOUT ROGOR. THEN I GUESS I WON'T BE CHAMPION. ( sighs ) ARMSTRONG... WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, YOU'RE GOING TO WORK FOR ME. NOBODY TELLS ME WHAT TO DO. HOLD IT, WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. MAYBE YOU GUYS BETTER LEAVE - BEFORE THE SHADOW POLICE COME, OKAY? - ASK AROUND. COME ON, ROOK. SIT DOWN, I'LL GIVE YOU A RUB. COME ON, SIT DOWN. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THOSE CHEAP HUSTLERS. SO HOW COME YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM YOU WERE GOING BACK TO EARTH? - MAYBE I'M NOT. - WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T KNOW. I FELT SOMETHING IN THERE TONIGHT, SHORTY. - YEAH. - I MEAN, I CAN ACTUALLY FIGHT IN THE ARENA. - I CAN WIN. - RIGHT. JIM ROGOR MIGHT FIX THINGS AROUND HERE, - BUT HE DOES NOT CONTROL ME. - RIGHT. THEY'VE BEEN SAYING FOR YEARS THAT NO HUMAN HAS GOT THE GUTS TO FIGHT IN THE ARENA. I'M TELLING YOU, SHORTY, I CAN DO IT. - RIGHT. - I CAN GO ALL THE WAY. RIGHT. YOU WITH ME? YEAH. MMM. SO THE THRAKIAN SAYS TO THE ALGAE HARVESTER, "IF THAT'S YOUR DAUGHTER, WHERE'S THE COROLLIAN NASTULATOR?" ( crowd laughing ) THANK YOU. AND THAT HORN, THAT HORN IS SO DUMB, HE USED A NORVAX FOR A TUTOR! ( crowd laughing ) I LOVE THIS GUY. HE KILLS ME. - I DIDN'T GET IT. - YOU DON'T WANT TO. I COULD STAY ALL NIGHT, FOLKS, BUT I GOTTA GO. A HAND FOR THE BOYS IN THE BAND. AND REMEMBER, I HATE YOUR GUTS! ( playing techno music ) I'M GONNA GO TALK TO THAT SPORTSWRITER OVER THERE. A LITTLE PUBLICITY NEVER HURTS. WATCH THE CHAMP FOR ME. YOU GOT A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THAT. HOW DO YOU MEAN THAT? I JUST MEAN THAT I WANT YOU TO GO ALONG SLOWLY. I MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR SHOT, BUT I WANT YOU TO DO IT MY WAY. UNDERSTAND? QUINN, HOW CAN SOMEONE WHO LOOKS AS GOOD AS YOU DO BE SO TOUGH? HOW DID YOU GET STARTED IN THE FIGHT GAME ANYWAY? MY DAD USED TO RUN A STABLEFUL OF FIGHTERS. OH, REALLY? WHEN? A LONG TIME AGO. HE HANDLED QUITE A FEW HUMAN CONTENDERS. AS A MATTER OF FACT, MARCUS WAS HIS LAST CHAMP. HE LOVED THE ARENA. AND THEN ROGOR CAME ALONG AND TURNED THE SPORT INTO A BUSINESS. ( sighs ) A DIRTY ONE AT THAT. IT BROKE MY DAD'S HEART. MY DAD DIED AND LEFT ME SPINNER AND A COUPLE OF SPARE PARTS, AND THAT'S ABOUT IT. I'M JUST TRYING TO KEEP MY DAD'S DREAM ALIVE. STEVE ARMSTRONG! YOU'RE THE NEW HUMAN FIGHTER. WE SAW YOU BEAT SLOTH IN THE ARENA. YOU WERE GREAT. WASN'T HE, GAR? WELL, WASN'T HE? - COME ON, PEOPLE, COME ON. - ( laughing ) CELEBRITY HOUNDS. - ALL RIGHT! - LOOK WHO'S HERE. ( laughs ) Horn: HEY, HOW ARE YOU? YEAH YEAH, I'M THE CHAMP. RIGHT, HEY, HOW ARE YOU DOING? YOU SEE MY FIGHT? NOT A BAD FIGHT. THIS LAD SHOWS PROMISE. PROMISE? HE KNOCKED HIM OUT OF THE RING. Quinn: YOU KNOW, ROGOR, IF I WERE YOU, I'D BE CAREFUL. YOU MIGHT JUST BE LOOKING AT THE NEW CHAMP. ( laughs ) EXCUSE ME. I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO JADE. JADE, THIS IS STEVE ARMSTRONG. I BELIEVE I'VE MENTIONED HIS NAME. WE'VE MET. YEAH, MY LUCKY CHARM. IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU ALL, BUT IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M ABOUT TO GO ON. LUCKY CHARM? SO YOU'RE QUINN'S NEW BOY, THE HUMAN CONTENDER. WELL, SLOTH WAS ALL WASHED UP. DON'T THINK FOR A MINUTE YOU CAN GET INTO THE ARENA WITH ME. I AM HORN. I AM CHAMPION! SOON TO BE EX-CHAMPION. IF YOU WANNA GO WITH SOMEBODY, - YOU CAN GO WITH ME RIGHT NOW. - HORN! SAVE IT FOR THE FANS. NO POINT IN GIVING AWAY WHAT THE PUBLIC WILL PAY FOR.

BUT I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS. I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO DESERVE IT. ONE FIGHT? YOU FOUGHT 50 FIGHTS FOR THIS. YOU WERE THE GREATEST. YOU GAVE US HOPE AGAIN, BOY. AND YOU GOT A LOT OF FIGHTS COMING UP, SO KNOCK 'EM DEAD. - ARMSTRONG! - Crowd: ARMSTRONG! ( chanting ) ARMSTRONG, ARMSTRONG... LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE HAVING FUN FOR NOW. I APPRECIATE THE JOB WORKING FOR MR. ROGOR. YOU'RE GOING TO BE MY INSURANCE POLICY. Announcer: The crowd's so excited they're chanting. They're angry. They want something-- a kick to the mouth, a right hook. He's toe to toe with Valcan. Oh, he's got him in a flying astrospin. ( alien announcer speaking ) ( buzzer sounds ) Armstrong's done it again. Hey, this kid's definitely for real. ( alien announcer speaking ) Announcer: Five fights, five victories. A right cross. A bollo shot. What a combination. He's down. He's flatter than a galactic pancake. What a giant knockout for the kid. After this win, Horn has got to give the human contender a title match. What a contest that will be. - YES, COMMISSIONER. - I trust you agree? They've got a lot of pressure on me. - YES, I UNDERSTAND. - That there's a lot of kruger at stake. - ( laughs ) - Give the people what they want. - You do understand? - YES, COMMISSIONER. So you'll set the date then? IF YOU THINK HE'S READY, SIR. Frankly, we don't have a choice. And it'll be a good match. YES, IT'S GOING TO BE A GREAT FIGHT. All right then. THE COMMISSIONER IS FORCING ME TO GIVE ARMSTRONG A TITLE SHOT. WELL, WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING, RIGHT? I MEAN, IF ARMSTRONG BEATS HORN, YOU'LL LOSE CONTROL OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTS. HE WON'T BEAT HORN. BUT WHAT IF HE DOES? LOOK, MR. ROGOR, I'VE GOT THIS PLAN I'VE BEEN WORKING ON WITH SKULL HERE. AND YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT. YOU'RE REALLY GONNA LOVE IT. YOU MIGHT EVEN GIVE ME CONTROL OF THE EAST HUB BETTING SLATS WHEN YOU HEAR THIS. WHAT PLAN? WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - SKULL. - I FIGURED OUT A PHASE THREE ENTRY INTO THE SEIKO 3000 WITH A 50,000 RAM OVERLOAD VIA POINT ENTRY THE NUMBER 12 FREEZER CABLE-- THAT'S ENOUGH, SKULL. THAT'S ENOUGH. LOOK, MR. ROGOR, WHAT SKULL IS SAYING IS-- IS THAT WE CAN FOOL WITH THE HANDICAPPER. AND NO ONE'S EVER FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO THAT BEFORE. ( laughs ) ( laughs ) YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE IT CAN'T BE DONE. NO ONE HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO GET INTO THAT INFERNAL COMPUTER. MR. ROGOR, IF YOU LOSE CONTROL OF THE CHAMPIONSHIP FIGHTS, YOU'LL LOSE CONTROL OF EVERYTHING. I HAVE A PLAN OF MY OWN. NOW YOU AND YOUR SKELETAL SIDEKICK LEAVE ME ALONE. - MR. ROGOR. - GET OUT! YEAH, YEAH YEAH, YEAH, YEAH. ( chattering ) GET IN THERE! WORK HIM INSIDE. COME ON, STEVE.

LOOKS LIKE LOVE TO ME. JADE. HEY. WHY DON'T WE GET TOGETHER LATER? AND TAKE MY MIND OFF THINGS? WE CAN, YOU KNOW, RELAX. IF I'M NOT RELAXED, I CAN'T THROW MY BEST PUNCHES.

HELP YOURSELF. HOW ARE YOU FEELING ABOUT THE FIGHT, STEVE? IT'S LIKE YOU SAID: BY THIS TIME TOMORROW NIGHT, I SHOULD BE CHAMPION. CAN YOU HELP ME WITH THIS? SURE. HERE, LET ME STAND UP. IT'S EASIER THIS WAY. IF YOU SAY SO. WHAT ABOUT THE FIGHT? LET ME WORRY ABOUT THE FIGHT. WHAT IS THIS? A TOAST TO THE NEXT CHAMPION. YOU KNOW I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO DRINK. STEVE, IT'S FOR LUCK. WHAT HAPPENED? ( chuckles ) HORN WON'T HAVE TO WORK UP MUCH OF A SWEAT TONIGHT. ( moans ) YOU'RE NOT FALLING FOR HIM, ARE YOU? ARMSTRONG? NO. JADE? JADE! ( crowd cheering ) HORN HORN! HORN! HORN! HORN! HORN! HORN! HORN! HORN! YEAH, COME ON! I AM THE CHAMPION! GET OUT OF HERE. It's just incredible. And Horn has broken with the tradition that the champion enters the ring last. HORN HORN! HORN! HORN! HORN! HORN! ( booing ) Horn: OH, SHUT UP! I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. IF HE DOESN'T SHOW UP SOON, THEY'RE GONNA CALL THE FIGHT. - ROGOR'S GOT SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS. - NO, HE DOESN'T. - GET HIM ON THE TABLE. - OKAY, ALL RIGHT. WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN? IT DOESN'T MATTER. JUST HELP ME GET READY. GIVE ME THE LIGHT. HIS PULSE IS SLOW. THIS BOY IS NOT FEELING ANY PAIN. I'M ALL RIGHT. I'M ALL RIGHT. BE STILL. HE'S BEEN DRUGGED. - I'LL GET A DOCTOR. - OH, KID. ( sighs ) HE CAN'T FIGHT LIKE THIS. - CAN I FIGHT LIKE THIS? - AH, COME ON, KID. THIS IS THE CHAMPIONSHIP, STEVE.

( chanting ) ARMSTRONG, ARMSTRONG... WE WANT ARMSTRONG! WE WANT ARMSTRONG! This crowd is growing restless. Now where is the challenger? HOW IS HE DOING? WE'LL KNOW BETTER WHEN THE TEST RESULTS COME IN. - WHAT'S THE PROBLEM? - BLOOD INFECTION, COMMISSIONER. HORN'S BEEN OUT THERE FOR 10 MINUTES. THAT CROWD IS READY TO TEAR THE ARENA APART. ( chanting ) WE WANT ARMSTRONG! WE WANT ARMSTRONG! The first human fighter in half a century, Steve Armstrong represents the hopes, the dreams, the desires of every Earthling. ( chanting ) STEVE, STEVE, STEVE... TRIMETAZINE 25. HE'S LOADED WITH IT. 50cc OF CRYSTALPLEX IMMEDIATELY. Computer: Vital signs critical. Approaching terminal. HOW SERIOUS IS IT? ANOTHER TWO HOURS, HE WOULD'VE BEEN DEAD. SOMEONE TRIED TO POISON HIM. - WILL HE BE ALL RIGHT? - WE'VE GIVEN HIM A POWERFUL ANTI-INFECTOR. HE SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF IT IN, OVER, 15 MINUTES. Commissioner: WILL HE BE ABLE TO FIGHT? HE WON'T BE 100%, BUT YES, HE CAN FIGHT. BUT I WON'T TAKE RESPONSIBILITY. WELL, IT'S UP TO YOU, QUINN. DO YOU WANT TO WITHDRAW? SO WHAT'S THE MATTER? ARE WE GONNA FIGHT OR WHAT? ( growls ) MOVE IT OUT. I WONDER HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO WAIT. ( crowd chanting ) STEVE, STEVE, STEVE... WHAT'S THE MATTER?
