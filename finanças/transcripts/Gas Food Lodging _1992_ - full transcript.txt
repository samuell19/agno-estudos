(Shade) 'If it weren't for Elvia Rivero, 'this story wouldn't even be worth telling. 'Whenever Elvia came to this dead old town, 'well, it's like she woke the place up. 'My hometown, Laramie, New Mexico, it came alive. 'Elvia Rivero was the one who made me laugh when I needed to laugh. 'She made me cry when no one was looking. 'But most of all, Elvia could put into words everything I was thinking.' (Elvia speaks in Spanish) (Shade sniffs) (Shade) 'It was Elvia who first gave me the idea. 'It was decided then and there. 'I knew what was missing from my life. 'A man.' - Gracias, señora. - Buenas tardes, Shade. Buenas tardes. Oh, shit! (Shade) 'Oh, no! Don't get me wrong. 'Not a man for me, for my mom. 'Then we could do all the dumb normal stuff regular families do.' (Truck brakes squeal) Shade! (Chuckles) Hi, Darius. Oh! Oh! (Laughing) Come in. Oh, I can't. I have to go meet my stupid sister. Bye. Maybe I want to sit at the counter. Don't worry about it. As soon as I'm out of here, you can do what the fuck you want. Ooh! Promises, promises. Hello, girls. Oh, hi. - Trudi. - Thanks. I'll send your favorite waitress over as soon as she finishes the big party in back. You want something to drink? Uh, yeah, a slice, in a big huge glass with some ice, please. - Duh, she's waiting. - What? Diet Pepsi. Diet Pepsi. OK. So, where is our favorite waitress, anyway? I got the most amazing idea today, Trudi. (Clattering) Oh, man! Lo siento, señorita. Hey, it's no problem. It was an accident. Accidente. Oh God, don't just stand there, wetback, get a towel! Clean it up! Trudi! Glad he didn't spill it on me. I have a date later. Oh, really? With who? Nobody you'd know. By the way, the name's Javier, not wetback. My family's been in this town for five generations. Where is the bitch? I don't have all night. (Nora) The old bitch is coming. (Laughing) She heard you. If I was you I'd just keep my mouth shut on your date tonight. - You may risk blowing it. - He's an idiot. He isn't interested in my fucking vocabulary. I didn't say "old." Oh, goody. Come on, girls, make it quick, I'm snowed. Why are you working two stations? (Sighs) Unlike some people, I notice. (Nora) Yeah, some people notice. What are you gonna have? Um, a dinner salad with blue cheese dressing. No. No dressing, just a lemon wedge. That's it? No way. You're having some protein, Trudi. Come on, I had protein once already today. Like what? You're having the fish. Fish? Make me sick. Fine. Bring it. I won't eat anything then. What are you gonna have? BLT with onion rings. Oh, yeah. And could I get another slice in a big glass with ice? (Nora) Where is Javier? He walked. - He walked? - Mmm-hmm. He just walked out? (Nora) Oh, that's just great. I am not going out with a beautiful boy smelling like grease and fish. Fuck that. - (Shade) Where are you going? - I'm not eating. Forget it. That's just great, Trudi. Eighty six the red snapper. (Speaking Spanish) (Birds chirping) (Speaking Spanish) (Shade) 'The question was, 'what sort of man would my mom go for? 'My dad walked off before I could remember things. 'And I haven't seen her with any other guy in almost two years, 'since the one who held the gun on us. 'Before him there was this really, really rich guy, 'who took me and my sister to Kmart one day, 'and let us buy anything we wanted. Anything. 'And we said, "Marry him, Mom. Marry him." 'But she said no because if she did, it would be for the wrong reasons. 'So that was the end of that. 'Well, and then there was this young guy. 'He was more of a pal. 'He used to turn out all the lights in the trailer 'and go, "Bring me the knife! Bring me the knife!" 'And me and Trudi would hide in the dark and scream. 'And my mom would get all mad at him and say, "'Stop it! You're getting them all wound up before bedtime." '(Chuckles) And we'd all laugh so she had to laugh, too. 'I wonder whatever happened to him. 'There are so many kinds of guys. 'There's so many kinds. 'But there was only one guy missing.' El Paso. Uh, last name, Evans. First name, John. - (Female Operator) 'I have a J. Evans.' - OK. Thank you. I'll take it. - 'Hold for the number.' - Thank you. (Shade) 'The only man missing was John Isaiah Perion Evans. My Dad. (Man) 'Hello' "And be sure to turn out the lights." "We will." "I did. She was the last one in there." Where is your sister? Shade, wake up and tell me where Trudi is! God, Mom, I don't know. I was having a good dream. Go back to sleep. (Clock ticking) (Sighs) Oh, Trudi. This was amazing, Trudi. You're really amazing. - I'll call you tomorrow, all right? - OK, yeah. Now, get some sleep. OK. Bye. Bye. What? I had a date, so? It's 2:30, Trudi. You haven't been to school in two weeks. - I have, too. - Not according to this. This is bullshit. You're going to school or you're gettin' your ass a job. Fine, I'll get a job. Doing what? I don't know. God, something. - Now would you lay off? I'm tired. - No, I'm not finished with you! You don't come in at no 2:30am as long as you're living in my house. - Got it? - I got it! And I don't know how the hell you piss the hours away, but I got a pretty good idea. - It's none of your business. - Oh, no? Whose business is it if you get knocked up? Or if you bring home a nice dose of the clap or AIDS, huh? Answer me that. Whose business is it then? Not yours! I wouldn't tell you shit if I were dying! Listen to me, young lady, you got three choices. You go to school, you get a job, or you get out! Fine, then, I'm out of here. (Trudi) I can't stand it here with you! And you don't close the door in my face! Come on, I have to go to school tomorrow! - (Nora) You're gonna shape up around here! - (Trudi) Get out of my fucking life! Sweetheart, I can make you very sorry you said that. Go to bed, Mom! Just go to bed! (Sighing) (Nora) I will go to bed when I want to, you understand me? (Door closing) (Man) Hey, will the new girl come get her order? (Man) Trudi, Trudi, pick up. OK. Here you go. - Will that be all? - This'll do. Thanks. Uh, one moment. I ordered the Western burger. Oh, oh, just a sec. Shit! Um, that's his burger. You... you ordered the French burger, that's the Western... Oh! (Sighs) Too late? It's OK. I'm sorry. It's my first day. It's all right. I'm from England. We're used to bad service. Is that supposed to make me feel good or something? (Speaking Spanish) (Sobbing) (Man speaking Spanish) (Sobbing) (Chair creaking) Hello? Anyone aqui? No! Stop! Are you crazy, man? You could lose a finger like that. Sorry. Oh, it's you. Done any Mex-bashing lately? - What? - Oh, I'm sorry. You probably don't remember me. I know all us "wetbacks" look alike. Guera. Hey, I didn't say anything. Wait a minute. I do. I do remember you. You're the busboy who walked out. You left my mom stranded at dinner rush. God, who could forget. You don't seem to be much better at this job. In case you don't know, most projectors have a knob for focus! (Chuckles) Bye, chula. (Chuckles) I think we've been over this about 100 times too many. Look, Nora. Hey, Nora, Nora, wait! Wait, wait! Come on, open up. Let me... Let me talk to you. What, Raymond? - What's to say? - (Sighs) Well, I... Maybe we could have a drink or a cup of coffee? Spend a little time together? Julie, in all those years, never knew a thing. We never hurt nobody. I can't get it through your head that you're not the only one with a family to protect. My girls are grown up now. I... I can't be messin' with a married man. I got to set some kind of example. Well, it seems to me that if I make you feel good, that's the type of example that would mean something to your girls. Better than the role model of being a lonely woman. Well, yeah, I get lonely. I do. So, big deal. Women are lonely in the 90s. It's our new phase. We'll live. I've been lonelier. Well, you take care. Take care of those girls of yours. I still want to meet 'em one day. It's nice to see you. Yeah. (Sighs, moans) (Lips smacking) (Moans) Nora, Nora, Nora. You are so beautiful. Oh, I gotta go. (Sighs) (Car engine starts) (Hits the car top) Shit! (Darius) She's so beautiful. I mean, the words. "Have to believe we are magic." It's tripped out. She's proposing some very weird, cool, and scary shit. Like what? Like that feminine shit. Going further than love. Further than sex. Like death. Like, don't fear the reaper. The way I see it, chicks are the ones who want to go to outer space. That's why they push it so hard. Well, it's like Adam and Eve. Like, he was fine grooving in paradise, but... ...Eve wanted something scary. She wanted the fuckin' edge. She wanted to jump off cliffs just so she could see what it was like to fall. Risk. That's what this song's all about, Shade. That's what Eve wanted. That's what Olivia wants. And that's what I want. - Has anybody seen Brett tonight? - Who? Brett? - Uh, yeah, I think I have seen Brett. - Really? Is he here? Yeah, I think his fiancée is giving him head. (All laughing) Oh. I'm... I'm sorry, that's your job, isn't it? He says you swallow, Trudi. Is that true? - Fuck you! - Hey! Stick around. You want Brett, there he is, right there. "I'll call you tomorrow, Trudi." "Oh, Trudi, yeah, baby, yeah. "No one's ever made me cum that way before." That was really cute. - What are you trying to do to me? - What are you trying to do to me? Nothin'. I'd kick you in the balls, if you had any. (Laughing) What's her problem? She's pissed because I won't go out with her. (Beeping) (Beeping) Could you fill this for me, please? Cream and lots of sugar. Sure. (Trudi sobbing) (Sobbing) (Waitress) Okey-doke. Here you go. (Sighs) (Coins clattering) Ta. Thanks. (Grunting) (Engine starting) Your thermos! Hey, your thermos! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! I know the coffee sucks here, but that's a nice thermos. My mind just walks away sometimes. Yeah. That's what men do, they walk away. Hey, wait. Can I give you a lift?

I guess I'm one of those girls with a rep. I never wanted to do it, but I do. I even make all the first moves. But I've been thinking about it a lot lately and thinking about... ...why I can't say no, and why I always have to do it? And I think it's because of my first time. These guys just did what they wanted. What are you saying? They pulled a train on me. They gang-banged me. I didn't report it. Are you crazy? Let the whole town know about it? I never told anyone. Not even my mom. I knew their names. Two of them were brothers... Sonny and Dan Richardson, and Ralph Ellison. A guy they called Tex. I never saw 'em again. Don't. After that, I never said no again. Why bother? They just do it anyway. This was the first time... ...I really wanted to do it. It was the first time I... ...I've felt anything. (Sighs) (Jeep approaching) I have to go away for a few days. There's a mineshaft near Carlsbad that has some rare species of rocks and... ...I want to check it out. - Oh. - What? It's not that far. I'll be back by Wednesday. (Sighs) Yeah, sure. Whatever. Hey! Don't be like that. Come here. Kiss me. (Sighs) I'll dream about you. Dream for me, Trudi. You have one month to find another place to live. One month. Fine. Fine? It's fine, is it? Yes, it's fine. It's dandy. Now leave me alone. Leave you alone? You bet I'll leave you alone. Pay your rent alone. See how "dandy" that is. I won't be alone! Not like you! I found someone and he wants to be with me! Yeah, sure he does. One month, Trudi. I will not put up with this anymore!

We went to the desert, Dank and me, and he showed me it's alive out there. It's not just nothing. Colors and sounds and flowers and... Trudi. I need your advice. (Sighs) See... There's a boy. (Sighs) And... ...he does all this stuff. Like he touches my face and he holds my hand, and he acts like we're buddies. You have to make the first move. What's his dream girl like?

I'm sorry, I can't invite the whole town. Hey, no need to explain. A rato. Shade, you shouldn't even be talking to that boy. He is a cholo. Pure gangster. You know, he's probably supporting a baby or two by robbing pizza delivery men and stealing car radios. You don't even know him, Tanya. (Sighs) He's not all that bad. Cholos are all the same, Shade. They deal dope. They kill each other for fun. They gang-rape girls and that's how the girls are initiated into the gang. (Sighs) Now, let's find me the perfect dress, OK?

Dear, sweet, pretty Nora. How is your mama? John... John, do we have the same last name? I'm him. I ain't shit, but I'm your old man, darlin'. (Humming) How was the party, honey? I met my dad. He's moved back? That's the first I heard about it. When? (Sighs) Look, I don't know. I was shocked, all right? I didn't ask him that. (Gasps) Well, there are a few things I'd like to ask him. It's impossible. I would have heard about it. I mean, this is a small town. He doesn't live in town. He lives out near Rockhound Park. Oh, great. And he doesn't even bother to call us? He just stalks us like the coward he always was. I knew I shouldn't have told you anything. (Gasps) I mean, this whole time I have been trying to help you find him! Ow! Here, let me put some aloe vera on it. (Sobs) No! Just leave me alone! Don't you see? It's all your fault! - Oh, that you burned yourself? - No! Don't you understand? That we don't have a family! You just hate men! That's what I think. You just hate them! (Sobbing) (Sighs) That's just great. I can see him being sincere. "Oh, my darlin', my darlin', where have you been?" Well, we've been here. (Speaking Spanish) (Crickets chirping) (Kim) Yeah? I'm looking for a Mr. John Evans. What for? What's he done this time? Nothing. I... I just... You one of his kids? - Yeah. - Huh! Oh, well, for heaven's sake, come on in. (Chuckles) John? - John! - (John) What? Trudi's here. Oh, I'm Shade. Not Trudi, Shade. (Woman on TV) 'Can you believe it? Look at that fire. 'Look at that diamond!' Well, Shady Lynne, how are you? Sit down. Uh, Kim, uh, get her some pop, honey. - Do you want something to eat? - No, thanks. I'm fine. I'll fix you a BLT. (John) That'll be good. - Did you meet Kim? - Hi, I'm Kim. Nice to meet you. What a surprise. Never know, do you? John, I... I need to ask a favor of you. My sister Trudi, she's away. And, uh, it's nothing for you to worry about or anything, but, uh, there's this really special nightgown I want to buy her, and I can pay you back. I'll work. I'll pay you a little bit back, each week. I can't let you pay back. How much you need? A lot. About 50 bucks. No problem. You wait right here. (Kim) I think we better talk. - (John) How much you got in your purse? - (Kim) You know how much I got. (John) I got 22 bucks. What about the mattress? (Kim) Uh-uh, you are not getting it out. How are we gonna live, John? We got our own problems. (John) That little girl out is my daughter. (Kim) What about my kids? (John) I'll be damned if I'm not gonna give it. - (Kim) Do you give a damn about my kids? - (John) That's not my problem. (Kim) Is that how it's gonna be? Not your problem? (John) Don't talk to me like that. (Kim) If you get a goddamn job and keep it, we wouldn't live like dogs. You are not getting in there. John, that is my money, too! Goddamn it, John! Stop it! John, goddamn it! Go on, take it. You take it. Are you sure it's all right? I got the money, didn't I? Thank you. Oh, your ma's done a great job. I meant to come and see you all, you girls, but, uh... The more I waited, the harder it got to face. Sure thought about you, though. Not a day's gone by. Well, anyway... Sure glad I could help. (Hens clucking) (Cat meowing) Is Javier here? (Cat meows) Is Javier here? Javier? Ah. (Bells jingling) (Clock ticking) Oh, hey. What's up? Oh, I'm sorry. I woke you up, huh? It's all right. Mom, this is, uh... ...Shade. This is my mom, Rocio. So... What's up? How was the party? Terrible. My friend, Tanya, she's a really good person, but she judges people she doesn't know. She thinks you're dangerous. - Yeah? - (Chuckles) Yeah, like what does she say? (Kettle whistling) She says you're a cholo. A cholo? A cholo? - Ooh. - (Laughing) She says you rob and even kill people. (Giggling) So, why are you laughing? (Guffawing) - You stupid! - Shit, I had you going! Oh, thank you. Oh, oh. Watch your ears. (Cassette player clicks) (♪ THE MITCH GREEN EXPERIENCE: "Maria") She can't hear the music but she can feel the vibrations that loud music makes on the floor. No. No, I can't dance. Really, I can't.

(♪ Man singing in Spanish) (Bells jingling) (Javier speaking Spanish) (Shade) 'It was the same for both of us. 'It was like we'd finally met our twin. 'Can you grasp that? '(Chuckles) Here we were, from two different worlds, 'and yet, when we were alone, 'together we made up the same person. 'In his arms, I knew who I was.' 'Shade. Just Shade. '(Chuckles) And that was more than enough. (Wind blowing) (Dog barks) Uh, where did you get this guy? He owns his own satellite dish company. (Laughing) That guy? (Cheering) You are good. (Whooping) - Oh, brother. - (Laughing) - Hi. - Hi. You come bowlin' much, Shade? - No, uh-uh. - No? I'll bet you're one of those matinee junkies. I've seen you leaving that Spanish theater. Yeah. How do you understand those movies, anyway? You know... (Mimics gun) (Mouthing out of sync) "I told you once, put down the girl. Hand me the gold." Or Elvia Rivero. "Te quiero." "Te quiero." - (Chuckles) - You know of Elvia Rivero? Oh, si, si. Es muy bonita. Es verdad? - Si. - (Both chuckle) Your mama looks just like her. (Projector whirring) (Inaudible) (Nora) 'OK, honey, that's it, that's it.' (Panting) - (Dank) 'I'll dream about you.' - (Nora) Breathe. - (Dank) 'Dream for me, Trudi.' - (Shade) Push, come on, Trudi, push! (Grunting) (Groaning) (Panting) - Push! Push! - (Groaning) - (Shade) Push, Trudi! - (Groaning) - (Panting) - (Shade) Trudi! It's coming! Push! - (Shade) Breathe. - (Panting) - (Groaning) - Push! It's coming! - Push! - (Groans) - (Baby crying) - (Nora) Oh, honey, that's it. - (Chuckles) - I'm so proud of you. (Laughing) (Shade) 'The baby had lips just like Trudi. 'Maybe she would have her same smile. 'Or maybe she would have Dank's eyes. 'Or maybe she would raise her eyebrows just like my mom. 'Maybe when she's started to talk, 'her voice would sound like mine. 'She'll grow up with her new mom in Dallas. 'And she will never see where any of her features came from. 'She will never know Laramie, 'or the desert where she was conceived. 'She will never know us.' - (Trudi) Hey. - Hey. This is my sister, Shade. This is Ivy. We're gonna be roommates as soon as I get out. Nice to meet you. Yeah. Wow, you guys don't look a thing alike. Well, I got to dash. Hang in there. I'm sure you're gonna feel much better when those stitches heal. You'll be able to wear cool clothes again, and lingerie. (Sighs) Are you really gonna stay here in Dallas, Trudi? You bet I am. Ivy's a model. She's great lookin', huh? Her agent's all excited about me. She thinks I've got it. What about me and Mom? We really miss you, you know. Laramie's a shit hole. There's nothing there. - There is something there. - (Sighs) Yeah. A lot of bad memories. The desert, Trudi. It's just like you said. It's alive. It's magic. That's not nothing. It was all bullshit. This is a rock. A fucking ugly, pointless rock! Get it through your head. I'm not going back, Shade. (Sobbing) Just tell me you're coming home. No, I'm not! Just... Just go!

Your name's Dank, right? No. Cecil. But where did you get these rocks? Well, they were sort of given to us by this British rock hunter. We just spent two days at Carlsbad, waitin' for the bats to return to the caves from Mexico. The bats migrate back in February. (Cecil) 'Drivin' back, we spotted this Jeep 'parked at this abandoned mine. 'My lady, Persi, said, "'Hey, Cecil, it's the Jeep of that fella who came in lookin' for Day-Glo rocks." 'We went lookin' for him, but it was empty out there. 'He'd been there for a week, 'when they dragged him out of the mineshaft. 'They sent his body and everything but these back to England. (Bats screeching) Well, his girlfriend just had a little baby girl. Aww. Here, take this. This one's got four colors. (Shade) 'He didn't leave her. 'And now, after all that has happened, 'it was the single gesture, 'the one true heart which has already changed the paths 'of daughters not yet heard from, those not yet born. 'He was hers till the end. 'And I'll tell her in time.'
