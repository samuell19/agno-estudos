[beeping] [man panting] [tense music playing] [dramatic music playing] What the hell? [siren wailing in distance] [dog barking] [Orlando] Hey, did you hear that? Sounded like a bomb went off. No, but I heard police sirens and thought maybe they were coming for you. [chuckles] [exhales] Where are you going? I got called in. Boss doesn't trust Enzo to run the shop. Shocker. It's Zoey's birthday, Orlando. [sighs] Who else am I doing this for, Kim? I can't lose this job. They're laying people off left and right. Checks aren't what they used to be. Listen... I think we're gonna go to my mom's for Christmas this year. I thought you were just thinking about it. Well, I thought about it, and I decided. - [scoffs] - I really, really didn't want to do this today. But today was the one day for you to choose us over work and not make it about yourself. Zoey's day. How long are you gonna keep punishing me for? We have tried everything. And I just can't. So, I'll have Zoey call you at noon, and you and I can play nice. If you can make the time for her. [door closes] ["We Wish You a Merry Christmas" playing] Hmm. Play the board, not me. Patience, Old Yeller. Hmm... Is that your action, Action Jackson? [chuckles] And Chief wanted me to remind you to stop leaving your Cialis out. Apparently, Jake thought they were Advil, - and had to cancel his PTA meeting. - [both chuckle] I know you're forgetting things as your age, but, you know... I'll always remember the ass-whooping you're about to get. Oh, big talk, big talk. Hmm... Before you take your hand off, you sure you want to do that? Okay, be a hero. What the hell does your broke down ass know about being a hero? Ah, more than you'd like to know. We've known each other for, what? How long now? Six months? Really? Are you going to do this again? It's been four months since my transfer. Seems like so much longer. And you're still making those damn rookie mistakes. Checkmate. Let's go again. Nah, best of three. - No, I already won twice. - All right, best of five. - Hey, guys. - Yep. We got a 10-80. Explosion at Neil Park. [tense music playing] Zoey bear. You up? [sighs] [elevator dings] First one in again. Good morning, ladies. Time to wake up. Rise and shine, Cindy Lou. Top of the morning to ya. All right. [phone ringing] We Save You IT. How can I help? [woman on phone, groans] My-my internet has passed away. [chuckles] All right, let's see if we can't bring that back to life. - Are you near your router? - Router? Yeah, you know, the box with the blinking light. [stammers] Isn't-isn't that the computer? No, miss, the other box with the blinking light. [stammers] Yes. - All right... - [elevator dings] ...let's try and restart that router. Flip it back on and give a sec. [beeping] [cat meowing over phone] - Off, kitty! - [cat snarling] Ooh, she sounds cute. - Nothing. - Well, if you trust me, I could save you a lot of time on a shortcut. Mm, shortcut? You know, sometimes, when I'm driving, I like to take the scenic route. Other times, faster is better. What do you say? - Let's try the shortcut. - [Orlando chuckles] All right, here we go. [tense music playing] [Orlando] All right. Naughty, naughty. [chuckles] [rapid beeping] How'd you do it? Well, some people call it magic, I just call it customer service, miss. Others call it illegal. Oh, calling me miss. You know how to make an old gal feel young. Well, there's survey after this call, if you enjoyed my service. And by the way, "password" isn't a good password. - Ah... - Thank you, ma'am. Have a nice day. Whoa! He shoots... Oh, he scores, and the crowd goes wild! Man, like, how do you do it, for real? It's called charm, bro. - Something you know nothing about. - Oh, I know nothing? I used to do magic at kids' parties, my friend. - That is charm intensive. - Get out of town. Really? - My daughter loves magic. - Yeah, of course she does. Everyone's a sucker for a little... sleight of hand. [whistles] Whoa, dude, that was good, man. Eh, right. It's a sick spot to meet MILFs, too. I'm serious, though. Mary's going to be pissed if she finds out you came in late again. Really? More than if she found out you just hacked a client's system? I took nothing. Left a customer happy. Ah, fuck it. Oh, speaking of happy... Looks like the boss left us a couple gifts. - No shit, really? - Yeah. Really? I guess she's good for something. Ooh, nice. What the hell? You know, my buddy at Google just got a laptop. Yeah, and we got black balls. Shit, man, what's the difference? Machines are gonna render us obsolete any second now. Maybe cleaning windows will be our next gig. Hell no. I mean, you afraid of heights, bro? - Hell yeah! - Yeah, I probably should have been, too. How do you think I got this? - Well, I thought it was too rude to ask. - [chuckles] No, come on. It was a construction gig fall when I was 17. You know, you'd think the worst part would be the impact, but no. It is the shame of being on top, and then fall on your ass in the dirt. Pops never quite got over that one. His army brat gimp not being able to follow in his footsteps. Oh, just a parent's love. [chuckles] [Orlando] Hey. Reports of a bomb going off in Neil Park. So far, there is only one fatality. We'll keep you updated as more information becomes available. I think I heard that on my run today. Oh, that blows. That dude looks familiar. Eh... not anymore, my friend. [elevator dings] Ah, finally. - Here you go. - Where's the usual guy? Uh, not my day to keep track, bud. Yeah, well, as long as the pastrami's bomb. Pastrami for breakfast? [exclaims] Don't knock it till you try it, my friend. Whatever, dude. Eh, that's good enough. Here, keep the change. Hey, merry Christmas ya filthy animal. [beeps] [elevator door opens] [siren wailing] Bad day to go to the park, I guess. Yeah. Ten pounds of semtex. Most likely remotely wired to a medium range detonator. Whoever did this wanted to watch. I don't think this was a chance victim. Gotta be real pissed to blow a guy up like this. Yeah, there's that. You think this was just a simple vendetta? - Don't you? - I don't know. Wanna look beyond the obvious, you know, check the whole board. Okay, Bobby Fischer. Let's go fishing. What do you think? Well, it's a military-grade trigger. That's a custom job. A lot of man hours on this. I mean, this is a career man. I think he gets a thrill out of his own handiwork. I don't think this is the endgame. [tense music playing] What the...? [beeping] Ah! Hey, the inmates running the asylum? Replacement cake just arrived. We had an incident. Hey, guys, keep it down. Um, Zoey wanted to open your present early, so I let her. Oh. Did you get my text? Yeah, um, I did. And, uh... Hey, Zoey, your dad's on the phone. Hey, Zoey bear! Happy birthday, honey. Why aren't you here, Dad? Well, honey, I wish I could be there. I had to work. I couldn't get out of it. That's what you always say. It's my birthday. Mom says that's basically a holiday, and she's here. Well, you know, computer gremlins never sleep, Zoey. You get my present? Yeah. You like it? No, I love magic. I practice, but I'm not sure if I've got it yet. I think you got to start that trick with your right hand, Zoey. Oh. [chuckles] Sorry. That's it, right there! You got it. Yeah, I'll keep practice... [mysterious music playing] ...more magic tricks tonight? I'm sure my friends would like it. You know what? I just happen to have Houdini handcuffs. We could try this trick tonight. [laughs] Hey, who's that idiot in the back? [chuckles] That's Enzo. Say hi to Zoey. We work together. - This is my buddy. - Well, hey there, Zoey. Hey, I hear you like magic, too. You know, maybe I'm gonna make your dad disappear if he keeps running late to work all the time. I mean, this guy is so unprofessional. Yeah. Well, I gotta go. Bye, honey. I love you. Happy birthday. I got to go, party time. Um, thanks for making the time. Yeah. Hey, you watch out for those boys. Huh? I love you. [beeping] [Enzo] Oh, hell no, bro! Come on, how do you fuck up a pastrami sandwich? You know what? No. - Lando, I-I gotta take ten. Cool? - Huh? No, no, come on, it's slow, bro. And the new delivery guy's not getting away with this shit. Plus, you know, I got a little business a couple floors down, so... - Yeah? New job prospect? - Oh, man, this one's an angel. - Yeah? The hot blonde? - No. No, no, keep up. That's Ava. That's the 7th floor chick. She's... [shudders] She's crazy. She's like legit crazy. Ah, crazy in the head, crazy in bed, right? Yeah, but this is like boiling bunny's crazy. It's a different... Anyway, just do me favor. If she shows up here, just tell her I'm not here. Okay? Hey, you do know Mary checks the security feeds, right? You don't think I thought of that, bro? My desk is in the blind spot of this office. Mm. Not as dumb as I look. - I don't know about that, bro. - Shut up. [elevator beeps] This fucking guy, man. What the hell? [phone ringing] [beeping] [captor, distorted] No matter what happens... stay seated. - [feedback] - Orlando, this is one problem there is no running from. Who the hell is this? Top drawer on your left, there's a mirror. Take it out. What the fuck? Enzo, I swear to God, I'm going to kick your ass. Guess again, bitch. Orlando, you will die today unless you do exactly as you're told. So take the mirror, place it under your chair, and look. Hotter. - Hotter. - Oh, Jesus Christ. - Yes. - What the hell is this? Put your hand on it. Put your hand on it! - [zapping] - [gasps] [voice laughing] What the hell is that? There's enough semtex on that chair for the biggest New Year's show in history. It's pressure-sensitive, so no more sudden jolts. Oh, and I don't know if you noticed that new area rug around the chair? That is an electric fence. So if you try and roll out, like you're used to running from most of your problems, this one won't let you get far. Do I have your attention now, Orlando? Or should I call you Red Knight? That was your hacker handle, wasn't it? [chuckle] You got a slap on the wrist for what you did, but I guess that comes with being a rat. Hey, look, if you're some kind of a hacking enthusiast, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but I've been out of the game a long time now. Oh, I think you'll pick it back up just fine. [chuckles] If you think that seat is hot now, it's about to get a whole lot hotter. Smile for me. What do you want from me? [captor] Two floors up: Bankers, hedge fund crooks, jack-holes, whatever you want to call them. I want you to rob them. If I get caught, I'm facing 20. I'll never see my family again. Well, that's a funny way of looking at things, because you'll really never see them again when you're blown to kingdom come. Don't you want a chance to fix that shit marriage of yours? Failure to complete your mission, you die. Your friends interfere, you die. Call the police, you die. And after you die, your wife and pretty little daughter will die, too. I... I can't do this. Oh, don't be modest. This is your nature. And you don't have a choice. If I do this, I go home? Never hurts to try. I have researched their system. [scoffs] Of course you did. They got blockade security. If I break in, there's 90 seconds till it shuts down, locks the accounts. That's why I chose you. Okay, one thing. I need my music. Okay? As long as it's not country. It's not country. [typing] All right. [knuckles cracking] Okay. ["Nocturne" by Chopin playing] [typing] [computer beeping] We're in. [captor] I never doubted you. That's not the part I was worried about. [phone ringing] [man on phone] Hey, have you seen this? There's been a breach. [captor] Ninety seconds starts now. Looks like you got caught. - You break into banks, people notice. - [elevator dings] [Ava] Where's Enzo? [Orlando] Hey, hey, hey. [shushing] Where is that asshole, Enzo? He's been ducking me for a week. [whispering] Quiet, quiet. Stay there. Stay there. What, is everyone on this floor a total jerk? [captor] Yes, stay. There's a bomb under his seat, and if either of you leave, you're both fucking dead! Uh... A what? Look under my chair. Shit! I suggest you let him work before there's too many pieces of you to clean up. [whimpers softly] [beeping] Yeah, yeah, I'm handling it. [Orlando] Damn it. No, no! - [captor] Figure it out. - My gear is in the locker. I need you to shut this down so I can get my kit. [voice laughing] - I-I have to go. - You can't go anywhere. If you leave, we're both dead. Please. I need your help. - What's your name? - Ava. [stammers] What's happening? Ava, I need you to get my locker, okay? My kit's in there. If you don't do that, we're dead. Go. Go, go! - Okay. - Better hurry. Fourth over, blue locker. Yeah, right there, right there. - Come on. - All right, what's the code? It's 9-12... - Nine-12... I need the lock... - What's the third number? Thirty-three. That's the wrong code. Thirty-six, 9-12-36. Hundred percent. What's the code? - That's it, go! Come on, come on! - Got it! Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock... Thirty seconds. Where is it? All this for that? This is what's gonna get us out of here alive. It's a backdoor program I made that allows me to break through most firewalls. All right. This better work. No. No. Come on. [grunts] [grunts] He locked me out of my system. [exhales] Good work, Orlando. Some people call it magic, I call it being good at my job. [beeping] Code red, all hands on deck! - [exhales] - [captor laughing] Very good, you two. It's amazing what humans can do with their asses up against the flame. Tell me what the hell is going on. You like movies, Orlando? I don't give a shit about movies right now. I really like Apocalypse Now. You know, I'm kinda like Willard, floating down the river to complete my mission. And you, well, I... I guess you're stuck on the boat with me. [laughing] What is this? [captor] Outsiders must be eliminated with extreme prejudice. - I just came to see Enzo. - No, no, no, don't go. Oh, then I guess you better be extra good, so I change my mind and don't kill you. That's a good girl. Now go take a seat and enjoy the show. - That's right. - It's gonna be okay. Now, Orlando, the numbers on your screen. I want you to transfer $2 million from the funds you just hacked into that account. It's gonna take time. Don't bullshit a bullshitter. You have five minutes. Be clear... When I tell you to bark, your only question should be, "How loud?" I'm gonna prep our next mission. See you down the river. [tense music playing] [whispers] Hey. Hey, Ava. Hey, is there anyone at work that might notice you're missing? - No one? - No. My-my boss isn't in today. The only person that knows I'm here is... [elevator dings] [Enzo] No, no, sir, sir. No, no. I-I clearly said pastrami, not salami. - I-I mean, I understand... - Enzo, Enzo. That's not my... Jesus! What the fuck? Okay, uh, Ava, I'm really sorry, but you cannot show up to my work like this. - This is... - There's a bomb under his seat. What? - What's she talking about? - Park bomber on the news. I think this is him. Oh, shit. [stammers] I'm gonna be sick. Orlando, don't let him leave. - What the fuck?! - [Orlando] Hey, Enzo, if you leave, we're all dead. - Jesus, dude! - Enzo, please, listen. Listen? Listen to the fucking voice in the walls? What the fuck are you even doing here today? Your-your office is closed! Wait-wait, whoa, whoa, whoa... Are you... Bitch, are you part of this? - Am I what?! - Why are you here?! Looking for you, you asshole! - [Orlando] Hey, hey, hey. - [elevator beeps] I'm the one who's got the skills to help you. - Not them. Let 'em go. - [whimpering] Hey, Enzo, don't go in there. I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry. I can't... I can't do it. I'll call the cops for you. Okay? If you go in there, we're all dead. Be smart. Enzo, no! I'm sorry. Sorry. [beeping] Okay. Ava, down! Enzo, no! [rumbling] [tense music playing] I knew it! It's military. Just not modern military. Vietnam era. Pressure sensitive. Viet Cong used to use them. Put so much as a feather weight on the trigger, try and take it off, kaboom. Damn! That's like Biblical old. That's like I was at Methuselah's bar mitzvah old. Those are four syllables, Methuselah, ooh. Yeah, I got him laid. I was the first guy to get him laid. I bet. - My big brother came back from 'Nam. - Yeah? He kinda taught me all this explosive stuff, made it kind of a hobby for us. - That explains a lot. - Oh, yeah. We were pyromaniacs. You blow enough shit up, your wires will be crossed, too. [sighs] Okay. Um, so what? We head to every veteran's support group and ask who's got a chip on their shoulder, or what? Sure, we can host a bake sale while we're at it. Actually, I think you might enjoy patting those vets down. Give a cavity search, whatever. Oh, yeah, love it. Why don't we just wait for a fingerprint from forensics? [dispatch on radio] All units, proceed to Hudson Tower. There's been an explosion. Repeat, all units. We got a piece of cheese. There's gotta be a pizza. - [sirens wailing] - [alarm blaring] What's going on? This one goes out to that late buddy of yours. Bye-bye, Enzo. Enzo! Enzo! ["Taps" playing] - [beeping] - Easy, now. Ava! Ava, can you hear me? Are you okay? Why? Would you be after part of the ceiling hit you in the head? It's a pity. But it wouldn't be the first time others have fallen for your sins. You killed him, you son of a bitch! He didn't do anything! Oh, please. Did you even know him? Or was he just another nameless, faceless program to you? You may have never murdered anyone, Orlando, but you have taken more lives than I could ever dream of. You're gonna pay for this, you son of a bitch. - You're gonna pay for this. - Am I? You're the one with enough C4 strapped to your ass to be the first man on Mars. - [screaming on computer] - [captor laughing] Sorry, I just couldn't resist. All right, come on, let's cut the shit. LCPD response time to something of our nature post-9/11 is seven minutes. With Christmas traffic, we've got 15 max. [Orlando] How do you know? [captor] That bomb in the park this morning? You gotta test these things out, or they might go... Bang! [chuckles] Just be glad it was your old pal Victor and not you. - Victor? - Or should I say V-Havoc? You two were quite the black hat team back in the day. Neither one of you got the sentence you deserved, did you? Thought he was absolved from sin. Back to the daily routine. Six AM jog, 6:45 coffee, 7:15 news in the park. We are creatures of habit, a blessing and a curse, I suppose. So what is this, a vendetta? As far as you're concerned, this is a job. A job I've spent a very long time studying your habits for. You really should spend more time at home. I'm guessing you wish you could fix that marriage of yours if you just had one more shot. Two million dollars. You can go retire on an island somewhere. You can't retire on two million in this economy. Besides, that money wasn't for me, that was for you. Oh, shit. What have you done? You earned it. The police would agree, but I want more. [laughing] Templar Bonds? I don't understand. You-you just had access to a bank. Why would you want bonds? I don't give a shit about bonds, you idiot. I want to own the owners. I want all the little pigs to live in fear for a change. I want my boots on their fucking neck. I want their money, I want their information, locked away in their little security deposit boxes. You want their servers. And the only way to those with access codes on individually encrypted drives in those boxes. Perfectly untraceable. All within an arm's reach of a six-point security grid, a grid that you will infiltrate and diffuse for me before it locks in 60 minutes. - You're crazy. - I'm an optimist. I need more prep. - I need more gear. - The more time you waste, the sooner SWAT bursts in, guns blazing. You think they'll ask questions first? [siren wailing] Well? All right, I'll do it. Good boy. What the fuck are you doing? I don't know what you're talking about. You spelled "hostage" wrong. You hit send, I kill Zoey. Look, I just wanna let 'em know I'm okay. You think I'm an idiot, you Ivy League prick? Take this as a fact. I am smarter than you. If you deviate again, I'm going to blow your ass up. And after they've collected as much of you as they can, your beautiful little Zoey, oh, she'll cry her little brown eyes out at Daddy's funeral. [crying] Daddy, Daddy... Only your casket's gonna be wired with C4. And then I'll drive to your parents' house, Ruth and Ben, on 801 Center Street and kill them, too. Do I need to keep going? I own you. Say it. "I own you." You own me. That's right. Good. Now that we're on the same page, after you penetrate the first five levels, I will deactivate the bomb for you to complete the mission. Do you have any idea how many people will be guarding these servers? Hey, Orlando? Use that big brain of yours and tell me, what company runs IT for Templar Bonds? We do. Ah! Okay. We could do a payload drop to cut lurkers. But even if we get through the first five parts of the security grid, there's no way to get through the last without clearance codes from a human. But the forums say Red Knight is a legend. Look, I don't care what the forums say. It is what it is. You do your part, I will do mine. [tense music playing] What is that? Something to help me move a little faster. Okay. [captor] Clock's ticking. Come out, come out, wherever you are. [Jackson] They say you're afraid of heights. Well, they're not my favorite. That doesn't look too big. Hey, pro tip, skydiving will take care of that. Yeah, I'm not jumping out of a plane unless it's on fire. Yo! Desk jockeys, you don't have clearance, 30-plus yards back. I'd say 60, at least 60 yards. That's... That's the debris zone. Where you're standing right now, we call that the vapor zone. How you doin', Tobias? My bomb squad might not carry the weight of twat. Not the guys you want to piss off, you know, 'cause you guys be like, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick... [imitates explosion] Oh, if you're the bomb squad guys, then blow me. Get the fuck in there. We got briefing. I hope it's brief. [typing] Ow... What...? Ava. Ava, you okay? What happened? I need you to stay calm, okay? I gotta finish what I'm doing over here. - What's going on? - It's the girl. She's alive. Who gives a shit? Focus on the task at hand. [typing] I got ya. [coughing] Uh-oh. Hey, uh... Hey, we got a situation over here. Hey, asshole, wake up. Well, that's no way to talk to me. I need to get out of this chair to get that fire extinguisher. No chance. If these sprinklers go off, it's gonna crash everything. Too bad. Your computer dies, you die. - Hey, Ava. - [groans softly] I need you to put out that fire. Can you do that for me? [tense music playing] Let's hope her legs aren't broken. Come on, come on. [chuckles] Don't let those sprinklers go off. There you go. Good girl. [fire extinguisher spraying] Goddamn, I love watching humans face pressure. Do they adapt, or do they shrivel up and wilt, like that little pussy in the elevator? You crazy asshole! Let us out! Orlando, grab the handcuffs behind you. Do it! Girl, go cuff yourself to one of the office racks on that wall. I'm sorry. [line trilling] [whispers] Can I trust you? It's time to fight back. [line trilling] [line trilling] I'm gonna open this one. - [phone vibrating] - Here you go. Thank you. Oh, look. Look how cute this is. [continues indistinct] [captor] Hey, Orlando. - You're famous. - Oh, my God. [phone beeps] My God. This just in, we're currently learning more information about the Hudson Tower explosion. Currently being treated as an active terrorist... ♪ Happy birthday... [newscaster] The man rumored to be behind the explosion is Orlando Friar. He faced considerable prison charges - due to his involvement... - Mom. ...with the World Tech hacking scandal before he turned state's evidence. We're currently searching for any ties to terror organizations. Why is Dad on TV? [newscaster continues indistinct] [captor] In the military, they call this a false flag. Get your eyes off the real killer. You should be thanking me. Now they're worried about a wild card Ted Kaczynski up here. They won't send in the cavalry as fast. You're welcome. [Tobias] All right, guys, no bullshit zone here. These are the facts. Our perp is Orlando Friar. Active on the tenth floor. This fuck has a bone to pick with the city. Let's discuss asset elimination. - Quite a way to put it. - Yeah, knee slapper. Look, I got two fire teams ready to bust his ass before he knows what's up. I can get in position anytime. - Just say the words. - Does he got a family? [Tobias] Yeah, wife and kid en route. Wouldn't be the first psycho with kids. Just want to weigh our options before we orphan his baby. Oh, yeah, what do you suggest? Well, I don't know. Full tech sweep. Get a visual. You know, see what we're up against. I can get up and let you know what I see through my sights. Damn, bomb squad cheese dicks always wanting the glory, huh? Typical. How about this? We strike, kill the fucker before he stings again, like a real man. Hey, no glory shit. I mean, just the x-factor of, I don't know, maybe a building wired to blow up. Bullshit. [Connelly] Cut the shit, Sergeant. Lance, get our eye in the sky up. Copy that, Chief. I'll let you know when I get there. All right, I want a confirmation of contact and demands before trigger pull. Wallace, you got first swing. Secure ground level and report back. Oh, thanks, Chief. Tobias, I want contact with the building manager, all right? - Now! Go. - You got it, ma'am. [sighs] Thanks, buddy. Hey, why ask that shit about his family? - Why do you care? - I don't. Other than a hacker, he ain't a bomber. [tense music playing] [trilling] [captor] Hostiles headed toward the lobby. - Better hurry. - Shit. [typing] And guess who else just got here. [Orlando] Oh, my God. - [captor chuckles] - [phone vibrating] [Kim] Hello? Orlando... [phone powers down] [wry laugh] On her birthday, too. It's my daughter's birthday today. [whimpers] And... what if you're there for the next one, right? - Yeah. - The one after that? You get your ass up off that chair. Figuratively. Get us the hell out of here. [whispers] All right. We've yet to receive any more information on Orlando Friar, the man holed up inside. However, we are being told that authorities are bringing down his family in hopes to establish communication. [captor] Lots of windows up here, huh? Take a look. Might as well wave. [chuckles] By now, tactical protocols will have at least three trained shooters right on you. Do you feel it? [tense music playing] I'm in position, locked and loaded. Target is in sight. Seems to just be sitting at his computer. Heh. You are lucky we're in such a sensitive age. They don't want to blow your brains out on live TV. [chuckles] Well, it seems that we've reached the next phase of our game, because now they're finally taking us seriously. Time for the confession. Record a video reading that exact message and stream it to the world. I want to talk to my family first. - Not a chance. - You want me to read this? I talk to my family first. - Or what? - Or I'm done. [captor laughing] You know, you are a real piece of shit, but you do care about your daughter. I respect that. Oh, what? We're buddies now? Let me guess, you got some kind of a daddy issue? [captor chuckles] My relationship with my father is... complicated. When he wasn't busy drinking and kicking my ass, we did have a bit of a green thumb growing up. You see, planter soil, it's a great place to hide a bomb. And the best part about 24/7 news is that the bad guys get to watch it all the same. So the first thing they do in our situation is sweep the area, but a fertilizer bomb, that doesn't show up when it's under a few feet of soil. So you read that confession now, or I press my little red button and turn your family into soup. All right, enough, enough. You want me to read this? Yes, that would be great. Oh, and Orlando, let's take it light on the improv. I'm a real stickler for my words. I'm being told that we're getting a call from within Hudson Tower. It could possibly be that there is someone trapped inside the building. Caller, what is your name? [Orlando] This is the man on the tenth floor. I want you to go live with this feed I'm about to send you. Hey, Zoey. My partner, Officer Jackson here, he wants to ask you a few questions. It's kind of stuffy in here. Why don't you go out and get some fresh air, maybe a snack? What do you think? - What do you feel like? - It's okay. You can go. Yeah? - No job too small, hero. - Not even babysitting. Ma'am... Chief wants to talk to you. Ms. Friar, I need to know everything about your husband, and if he's capable of doing something like this. No, this isn't Orlando. Well, he has record. Yeah, I'm aware of his record, okay? And yes, he has some red marks, but he's tried to change, and he's worked really hard to turn things around. He's trying. So he was going to be prosecuted before he turned witness? Um, yeah. It was, um... I was planning, um... on giving him a... But this isn't Orlando. - I know. - How do you know? Because Orlando has made some really stupid mistakes, but the one thing he wouldn't risk losing is Zoey. See, that works for me. Doesn't fit the profile of a gig like this. We're going off present intel. I called and he tried to call me. Um, I missed it. [news theme music playing] Chief, you gotta look at this here. Heads up. My name is Orlando Friar. I am the person responsible for the bombing in the park and Hudson Towers. There are more bombs in the building and hidden throughout the city. Any more intrusions from unwanted guests will result in hundreds of deaths. I hope I am clear. I have lied to all of you, to my wife, Kim, to my daughter, Zoey. I helped orchestrate one of the worst financial deceptions in public trust in our history. First, I want to set some ground rules. I am prepared to die. I am hooked to a dead man's switch. If you kill me, it will trigger all bombs... and it will be a bloody Christmas. Kim, Zoey... I love you! - [mouths] I'm sorry... - [static buzzes] This is not Orlando. He is terrified. - Get every single bomb tech ready to breach. - On it. All right, SWAT, prep for assault. - Wait... - Let's go. Please, just listen to me. [captor] What the hell were you thinking? Do you want your family to die? I told you to read exactly what was on that page! A man ready to blow himself up doesn't waver. And what are you gonna do about it? Oh, you think there's a way out of this, motherfucker?! You think I won't hunt you and your shitty little family down again? Clock's ticking. What were you talking about? Two years ago, uh, Orlando, he signed on with a... with a big bucks New York start up. Okay? And they paid all of our bills, and it was better than Orlando's former life in hacking. Investment bankers, old retirees. Anyone with portfolios was welcome. Old money, New York money. It was all supposed to be regulated, by the books. But we soon realized why they wanted Orlando so badly. They used me to crack into phones, to break into servers. Anything to gain an edge. I thought it was just data mining for them. But it turns out they were hacking into people's savings... their 401ks. And you didn't know? I, uh... I was willfully naive. I mean, these were powerful people. You know, Wall Street, politicians. Once the Feds got involved, I couldn't outright let them rob anyone anymore. And what about... The people who bought in? Broke, and eaten by the system they trusted. And it wasn't just rich investors, it was regular people. Their futures, their pensions, just gone. I worked for crooks who spent it as fast as they stole it. There was nothing to give back. No way to give these people their lives back. We put the bosses away. And me and my partner took a deal. I took a deal. You did what you had to for your family. When he found out what they were doing, he turned them in. He didn't think about himself or the family he was about to lose. And we left the city and we moved here. He lied to me, but, um, he did the right thing in the end. He's a good man. - He is. - [door opens] [Tobias] Locked and loaded, Chief. Green light. Green light? What is happening? All right, you need to go outside, please. - Please don't hurt my husband. - Listen, it's not up to us. It's up to him. He can either end this now or we'll end it for him. Can somebody get her outside? - Mom. - Zoey. Did you tell them about the message that Dad left us? Yeah... yes, he-he-he called and he left a message, and, um, it sounds like there's someone in the background. Just listen. Hey, hey, everyone, keep it down, will you? [captor] Hey, Orlando, you're famous. - [Orlando] Oh, my God. - I hear him. I hear there's somebody there talking to him. All right, we'll take it into consideration. - Will you help my dad? - Yeah, we'll do our best. Here. I tried to reach the building manager, Edmond Harris. No one knows where he is. Even his family. Could be the bomber. Chief, we gotta take this fucker before anybody else dies today. He says he's got a dead man's switch ready to blow. If we kill him, who knows how many more could die? That voice we just heard on the phone, he could be calling the shots. You want to take that chance? Now do you think maybe Orlando's the patsy? Chief, you read the sitrep. It's a fucking bluff! We're not gonna sit here and listen to these old, washed up bomb squad guys that haven't recovered from their fucked up past. Hey, that's not fair. Jackson's not old and washed up. Okay, shut the fuck up. Christmas '96, first call, domestic disturbance. Guy said that if we made a move, he'd blow the house, kids at all. Do you know how many times I would have said that idiot was bluffing? How many times I was wrong? It's not your call. And it's not yours. [sighs] It's mine. The queen's the most valuable player on the board. Just check the facts. What's the next move, Chief? Okay, I'm through the fourth wall. - Shit! - Shit? It's high-level encryption. How high? Well, if the Pentagon is a ten, it's a 12.5. Can-can you crack it? I ain't got no choice. Holding. [on radio] By your command. Red light, red light, stand down. Roger that. [exhales] Don't get too comfortable, Wallace, you're up to bat. Good. No, no, don't wait up. Working late, big shindig, you'll see. Make sure the milkman's gone before I get back. I wish you a Merry Christmas. I wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. [chuckles] Later, baby. You sing Christmas songs to your wife? Oh, yeah, she's kinky that way. You know what they say, calling before a job is bad luck. Who says? The movies. Yeah, guy calls his old lady, next thing you know, it's curtains for that guy. As a bomb guy, you savor every moment. - You got anyone you need to call? - Nah. What the hell was that? [captor] Protocol. They cut power before they burst in firing. Finish the job. [computer trills] Oh, no... [grunts] I lost progress on lock five. - Fix it! - Come on, Orlando. Come on, you got this. Come on. Shh. Let me think, let me think. There's nothing in this room strong enough to break it. Just figure it out, okay? Just figure it out. There-there has to be some hacker shit that you know that you can use... Come on! Mission victory is in sight! - Life or death! You choose! - Hey! You're as screwed as I am! If you could break in here yourself, you would. Just figure it out! Okay. Stop, stop, stop, stop... - Figure it out already! - Shut up! Hold on! We got to flood it. It'll look like a standard DDoS attack. We backdoor the defense response. We flood the servers. Templar Bonds guard protocols won't stand a chance. Everything out there is running on a network. All sending signals to that network. If I could redirect the signals, we could send them all here. I could use the traffic to overload their servers and jam them up. This disables lock five. The only problem is, traffic's gonna hit us, too. I need a shield. [tense music playing] [sighs] Tenth floor. I swear, if we take this guy alive, I'm gonna kick his ass. Come on, Old Yeller. It ain't time for pasture yet. - You okay? - Yeah. Yeah, your mom wore me out earlier. My mom don't like older men. Plus, she's racist. We're approaching the door. Hey, wait, wait, wait. There's somebody else in there. - [Jackson] A hostage? - Yeah, maybe. It's fiber time. Whoa. Nice rig. You're telling me a white collar hacker on parole made that? Pretty high tech. Wallace, stop, pan back. Pan back. We got a hostage. [captor] What the fuck are you doing? Red Knight has to shield the Queen. If I unleash this attack, we're right in the strike zone. All right, well, come on, hurry up. It shouldn't be taking this long. [trilling] [Tobias] Chief. - What is it, Sergeant? - We got something. Our assault team is at base camp. We know Orlando works on the tenth floor. Well, we're picking up another heat signature. Where is that? It's inside one of those server rooms. They're probably hiding in there. You know, hoping they would blend in with the heat of the servers. This jackass could be an accomplice, or someone controlling him. You gotta get this fucker. [Connelly over radio] Wallace, stop. We got a possible second suspect in the building. It could be our missing person, Edmond Harris. You're shitting me. - A second voice. - Yeah. We're fairly certain that's where the other bombs could be located. Don't tell me. Fourth floor, right? Server room. Why? Well, that's the weakest part in the building structure. It could bring the whole thing down from there. All right, SWAT's en route. We need one of you to meet them. All right, I'm on it. - [grunts] - No, you stay here. Disarm that bomb. I'll take care of it. Not a chance. Come on, movies, man. Guys split up now, it's curtains for one of them. Listen, Old Yeller, you're never gonna make it. Take care of this, I'll handle that. It's like chess, man. It's not emotional. I got this. All right. Well, listen, Action Jackson, you even get a whiff of anything rotten, you bail. - You hear me? - Roger. Me and you got unfinished business. - Click clack. - Good luck. - I was born for this shit. - Yeah. [captor] Orlando, get the cameras online. [tense music playing] He's trapped in there? Wallace, we got him. Hey, slow down, kid, slow down. See the next move. [captor] What are you doing? Flood the servers, finish the job. Hey, asshole, guess what? SWAT's about to knock on your door. What? [beep] Go, go, go, go, go, go! [suspenseful music playing] Hey, hey, hey, give me an update. What's the status? Come on. Talk to me. [Tobias] Don't you move, asshole! I'm gonna visit you in prison. I hope you like being someone's prison bitch, 'cause you're in the hot seat now. What the hell is that? [recording] I am not a crook. Death to the capitalist pig! It's Edmund Harris, our missing person. I tried to reach the building manager, Edmund Harris, no one knows where he is. Even his family. Is that...? [Jackson] He's dead, Wallace. [captor laughing] [Jackson] His eye is missing. [recording] I am not a crook. [distorted] Death to the capitalist pig. [beeping] What the hell is that? It's a bomb! Everybody get out! [gasps] Give me eyes in there. Can anyone read me? - Fuck. - [Connelly] Damn it! Fuck. Jackson, you all right? Jackson, Jack... Oh, fuck. Fuck me. [Exhales] Can anyone read me? Anyone? Damn it! Shit. [crowd clamoring] [Kim] Can you tell me what happened? Hey! Is he alive? Don't ignore me! Is he alive? [door closes] [tense music playing] Ava, you good? [stammers] What the hell was that? [sighs] I think they found him. I think they found him. [captor] Oh, they found something, all right. It won't be much of a problem from here on out. [laughing] How many must die for a simple job? How many lives are you going to destroy, Red Knight? Fuck you, you cocksucker! - [captor laughing] - It's not my fault, you son of a bitch! Oh, take responsibility for once in your worthless life, you pathetic little man. Really colorful language back there, though. You know, I-I particularly liked "prison bitch." [laughing] Well, who's the bitch now? Oh, that wasn't a rhetorical question. Hey! Who's the bitch now? I'm the bitch. No more games. You can't win. Launch the fucking strike. [typing] Do you want me to take the shot? You want me to launch this attack, it's ready. No, that is not him. He's talking to somebody. But I want promises. I want promises this time. You deactivate the bomb, and you set me free. [captor] I promise. Hail Mary time. [captor] Officer Reed. I wouldn't recommend doing that. Leave now before I turn you into cat food, like your friends on the fourth floor. You stay out. [mouthing] Help me. Finish the job, soldier! Yellow light. Waiting next cue. Green light. Roger that. Green light. All units, all units, stand down. Orlando is not the bomber. I repeat, Orlando is not the bomber. Red light, red light! Stand down! - [gunshot] - Oh, God! [whispers] Oh, God. That's a miss. Thank God. [exhales] [timer beeping] He must have a live feed here and into the rigged room. He's close by. We aren't making any more heat signatures out. He's here. He saw me as I came in. Read my name right off the tag. Plus, signals are jammed all throughout around the city after that DDoS attack. Only way to see in here, right now, is to be here. [captor] You see, soldier? I'm not the enemy. Everyone else is trying to kill you. [typing] [tense music playing] It's finished. I broke it. [captor] I never doubted you for a second. The last lock is manually operated. Disarm all the bombs and let me go. Man, you are a beast hacker, but you're gullible as shit. There's no fertilizer bomb out there. There's not enough soil. Where would I put it? Nah, there's only one bomb left, Orlando, and it's under you. I did my job. Let me go. I don't think so. I'll handle the last lock myself. Oh, no? [static buzzes] Hey... Ava. That shield wasn't just for him. It was for us, too. He can't see us or hear us. Not unless I want him to. [captor] Stay seated, Orlando. I'll let you know when it's safe to get up. [whimpering] Please help! He cut the cameras! That psycho can't see. Okeydoke, miss. Get you out of here in a jiffy. Hang in there, Red Knight. It's almost done. Son of a... Okay, get the hell out of here, go. - I-I... - Run. - Ava, go! - Ava, you're out. - Go! - Help him. - Wallace. - Orlando. - Yeah. - Can you get me out of this thing? - Why? You in some kind of hurry? - A little bit. - How much do you weigh? - How much do I weigh? - Yeah. - Uh, 175. One-seventy-five solid or 177? 'Cause it matters. Last time I checked, I was 175. What is it, keto diet? Get me outta this thing, I'll take you for ice cream. Yeah. Full-fat, okay? [beeping] [suspenseful music playing] Ah, damn it. Damn! - What? What, what? - Shit! I can't stop it. It's only rigged to explode. It's a pressure switch. Let's see what I can do. Ah, there's no way out. No way out. [beeping] Hey, you hear me, you son of a bitch? We made a deal. I help you, you let me go. I lied. [suspenseful music playing] [blaring] You motherfucking... You shouldn't have done that, asshole. - Tell my family I love them, okay? - Yeah. - I know what we're gonna do. - What are you thinkin'? Get out of here safe. Go. Run! Go! - [grunts] - [beeping] [people clamoring] Status! Give me a fucking status! [Orlando panting] You son of a bitch! Yeah! He's alive! You clever motherfucker. [siren blaring] - Dad's okay? - Yes, Dad is fine. Look, I'll answer questions later, all right? I just wanna see my family. Is this the man in the elevator? Yeah, that's my co-worker. And my friend. He was a good man. And I got him killed. - We can see Dad now, right? - Yes, sweetie. - He's not in trouble, is he? - No, I don't think so. - [man] Mrs. Friar. - Yes. Come with me, please, I'm gonna take you to see your husband. "Charlie don't surf." Charlie... Where is that from again? Apocalypse Now. Trippy movie. [Connelly] The guy in the picture was wearing an Apocalypse Now shirt. Apocalypse Now. [captor] You like movies, Orlando? I don't give a shit about movies right now. I really like Apocalypse Now. Is this the man in the elevator? It was a construction gig fall when I was 17. Pops never quite got over that one. His army brat gimp not being able to follow in his footsteps. Oh, a parent's love. [Connelly] "Charlie don't surf." My desk is in the blind spot in this office. It's him. [tense music playing] What the hell? [grunts] Ava. Where did you work in this building? Is it Templar Bonds? No, I-I work in the management office. Why? - So you have security access? - Yeah. Yeah, the hot blonde? No, no, no. Keep up, that's Ava. That's the seventh floor. [beeping] What's going on? Is that standard in elevators? I don't know. Hey, I think I know you. Yeah, I remember you. What are you talking about, baby? Oh, just that one idiot from Dad's office. You're Dad's friend, right? Yes. Your dad and I are... We're very close. [Kim] I thought that you... What's wrong, Mom? Nothing, just... something I knew. You know what? I was gonna save this for later, but... why not? It's your birthday, right? [bag unzipping] - Got a present for you. - Oh. [suspenseful music playing] Hey, somebody! Please, help me find my family. I need to find my daughter. Anyone? Hey, your daughter, was she wearing a pink jacket? - Yeah, where'd you see her? - An officer took her and another person up there. - That elevator. - Oh, my God. - They're going to the roof. - Let's look. [Enzo] Let's go! Walk! Walk! To your left. Good. Okay, stop. [whispers indistinct] [gasps] No, please! Shut up! Get over there. Over there. Now, you just think of this as a little fireworks jacket. Okay? The whole city's gonna celebrate your birthday! Let's go. [tense music playing] [groans] [screaming] [laughing] More collateral damage! How many gotta die for you, Orlando?! Whoo! [exhales] So we finally reach the end of the river. Willard came all this way to eliminate Colonel Kurtz with extreme prejudice, only to find out... when they met... [laughs] ...they were the same man. Come on out, Orlando! Face your commanding officer! Okay. Okay. I'm coming out. Here comes Daddy. Stop! Orlando, please fix this. Please! You fucked up. I had a well-planned, well-executed operation, soldier. Tracking, surveillance, listening to your droning bullshit every fucking day. God... is he that boring at home? I was so close. Do you have any idea what I put into this?! How long it took to build that chair rig?! Yeah, where'd you learn that? On Staten Island? Well... you learn a thing or two when your old man was... Delta in 'Nam. Your whole life is a lie. [Enzo] You good, honey? [Kim whimpers] You may not have put the bullet in my dad's head, but you fucking took him out of commission! He and my mom... Look at me! Okay, okay. They sunk every penny they had into that sham company of yours. You lied. You might as well have pulled the trigger yourself. Orlando... I need you to know... You deserve this. So this is all about your dad? I mean, yes and no. I did need your skills. Killing you, you know, that was just a... [clicks tongue] ...little perk. This is my sin, not theirs. The sins of the father... - Hey, let 'em go. - Dad, I'm scared! Take me. I can help you. I can help you vanish. Nah, I think this just became a suicide mission. Dad, I wanna go home. - We will, honey. - Quit lying to her. Quit lying to your daughter! That's what got you here! Your deceit, your lies! You fucking snake! Stop lying! You know what, Enzo? You're right. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the rush. I was good at it. I am good at it. And I would do it again. Especially to a sucker like your old man. Shut the fuck up! [grunts] [Enzo yells] [coughing] Honey, you okay? - [Kim muttering] - You all right? Okay, okay. Okay, let's get this thing off of you. - All right? - Orlando, get it off. [gasping] - [beeping] - Dad... Hang on, relax. - It's counting down. - Oh, no. Help! Help! [Enzo] What are you gonna do? [gasping] What are you gonna do, Orlando? Blame yourself again? Run. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying here. Go, Kim. Go! - No. - Go! - No. - Run... [chuckles] Checkmate. [gasps] Thank you! Thank you, thank you, thank you. [exhales] - [indistinct chatter] - [siren wailing] Yeah, I'm on my way. See you at the hospital. - [indistinct chatter on phone] - Yeah, a vacation sounds nice. Retirement sounds better. Yep. Thanks for helping out. Yeah, I'm just a guy trying to fix his family. That guy over there, he's the hero. He saved us all. Tell that to the papers, okay? We're gonna need you downtown for questioning. Can I just have a minute with my family? Yeah. You guys still mad at me for missing the party? I'm here to make it up to you, okay? [gentle music playing] [rock music playing] [rock music ends] [instrumental music playing]
