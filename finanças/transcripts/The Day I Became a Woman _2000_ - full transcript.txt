Hava, come on down. You're a woman now. You can't go on the roof. You can't play with boys any longer. Listen to your gran. Come down. Hava, get permission to come out. It's too windy to be up there. You'll fall. How come she was allowed to play yesterday? Mum, gran says I'm a woman now. Am I? Hasan, you can go in and play with Hava. Mum, gran doesn't let me play. You mustn't play with Hasan or any boy. You're all grown up now. You have to cover up your hair from now on. Look, gran. I bought a veil for Hava. Let me see. May I go and play? It's very pretty.

Now, let's see... anyway, no-one goes out at noon. Maybe we should let her go out for the last time. I remember when she was born. She was born at noon. I asked if it was a boy or a girl. They said, ''A girl!'' I already know all this. I gave birth to her, after all. You were distracted then. But, gran, if I were born at noon, I'm not a woman yet! But it is noon. No. it's still morning. Let me play with Hasan until noon. Please, gran. Will you let me? Go and check the time first. Make sure it isn't noon yet. - I'll go check. - OK. She never stays still. Look, gran. It's only... it's only eleven. It's not noon yet. I still have an hour. if I don't go, Hasan will think I'm sulking. Will you promise to be back by noon? - I promise. - God won't forgive you if you lie. - Don't be late. - I promise. How will you know it's noon? I'll take the clock with me. Can I go now? - You promise? - Gran, a minute just went by. - I'm losing time here. -You've to be back by noon? How will you know the time? I'll take it with me. Look, time is flying by. I'll show you how to measure time. Come over here. Sit down. When the stick casts a shadow when the stick casts a shadow.!.. it means it's morning. When there's no shadow you'll know it's noon. Put this scarf on. God be with you. When the stick casts a shadow it's morning. When there's no shadow you'll know it's noon. You have to be back at noon. OK, dear? Hey, kids... Khaled... Khaled, have you seen Hasan? - Which Hasan? - Hasan, the orphan. His sister took him. - Hello. - Hello to you, too. - Can you call Hasan? - He has homework. Please call him. How come your gran always throws him out? He can't come. Hasan, don't come out until you've finished your homework. Hasan, open up. It's me. I'm over here, Hava. - There you are. - Hi.

Ahoo... get down. Stop riding now. I'm talking to you. Why are you cycling? Don't you have husbands? if you don't get off, I'll sort you out right here and now. - Won't you get down? - No. Ahoo, you'll regret this. Ahoo, I brought Mullah Osman. Ahoo, why have you become rebellious? Have you had too much sun? Get off that! What you're riding is not a bicycle. It's devil's work! Get off that bike, dear. You really shouldn't be riding it. Have you told her the whole story? Remember when your hand was asked for... ...with a handful of gifts? Why do you want to ruin your life? Come back to your life. Neither God nor I approve of this. You're at the edge of an abyss. Get down off that bike, dear. Your husband needs you. if she won't listen, end the marriage. Do you agree to a divorce, dear? Yes or no? Yes... I concede. Make it official. Shall I recite the verse? Shall I recite the verse? Our marriage is annulled. Her husband chased her on a horse... Do you have any water? Ahoo, stop! Get down! Return to your life. Ahoo, don't run away. Hello. Ahoo, your husband is a good man. He still loves you. Your old granddad is here to help. Get off... get off that bike! Ahoo... I'll give you a count of 1. Ahoo... one! Two! Three! The devil's got into you! Four! Get off right now! Five! Six! Last chance. Seven! Ahoo, dearest. We'll drag you off that thing if we have to. Your brothers are on their way. You've insulted our honour. Your husband has divorced you. What are we to do? For God's sake, daughter. Return. Shame on you. I curse you. You didn't listen to your granddad At least heed your father. Fear your brothers. Ahoo, return home now. Third tale: Hoora Where to, madam? To the market. I want to buy some things for the house. Tell me exactly what you need, madam. Then I'll take you to the right place. Household goods, you know. Household goods. Top priority is a fridge which I've never had. All my life I wanted cold water. Now which one was it? Ah, this one was the fridge. Let's buy that first. What's next on your shopping list? ironing board... bath tub... samavar... Bedroom lamp shade... Who are you buying all this for? For myself. I want to buy everything I've never had. Don't forget I also need a gas oven. I tied a knot for the oven... Ah, that's the one. Which one was the washing machine? For that we need the other market. I've inherited some money. Loads of money! - How do you plan to carry all this? - I'll manage. Lord, why can't I remember this last one? Do you know somewhere I can lay out my things... ...to see what's missing? My memory is not what it used to be. I even forgot to feed the rooster before leaving home. I hope it doesn't die. I have a feeling I'll never remember this one. Bring the new pot here for a cup of tea. it'll be just what we need. Right away. I can hardly walk any more. Madam, a refreshing cup of tea coming up. Well done, son. I'll find a match for the oven. Tell the kids to gather everything in one place. I've seen the large salt cellar... ...but not the little one. Tell them to be careful with my make-up kit. It's important. How come this tea-pot is so... naked? it has no shame! it has no shame. It's not my fault. After searching the entire market, you came up with a naked pot? It's completely transparent. They didn't have any other type. I would be ashamed to use it. Let's take it back. Put it back in its box. OK, let's go return them. Hey, guys. The old woman's gone. She's gone. I told you they wouldn't accept it. To hell with them. My own pot is better. It's full of memories. if that lousy bastard had married me I would have a son like you. You remind me of him. Since I have everything now, will you become my son? Thanks, but I have a mother. That's a pity. Two things are bothering me. First, the rooster I left at home without food. And the second thing is this... We bought the rice-cooker and the cutlery... ...but I can't find the small flowerpots. The old lady is here. Put everything back. Because the tide is low ships won't come any closer. Some of the lads have small boats. We'll carry your stuff to the ship. I'm out of breath and my legs are killing me. Put the kettle on, dear. - And sort out my shopping, please. - Leave everything to me. We'll go fetch the boats and the floats... Lads, let's fetch the boats and take her things to the ship. Let's go. One of you should stay behind. - He should stay. - Me? Me? The one wearing an Afghan outfit. The white one. You stay behind and make a cup of tea. What did I buy all this for? I wish I had a son like you. You're very sweet. White and beautiful. Will you let me adopt you? I already have a mum and dad. But I have so many things now. Won't you reconsider? Can't you choose one of the black kids? But you're prettier. You have blond hair and white skin. You're the one I want. - Come back with me. - Like I said, I have parents. - Hello, madam. - Hello. What's the story with all these things? Are they yours? Yes, mine. We were amazed to see all this stuff on the beach. The kids are fetching boats to carry the stuff out there... ...to the ship. At your age, what do need all this for? if it was all ours, we could get married and start a new life. I have never owned any of these goods before. Every single item has sentimental value for me. When I was poor, no-one cared to help me out. Take tea with me. Lad. Put the kettle on, please. - What are you doing here? -We were cycling. We were left behind. Then you have time for tea. The floats are here. Load the stuff while we have tea. As long as we leave before the tide gets any lower. OK. What do you do again? We were in a cycling race. There was a girl there whose husband tried to stop her from cycling. She disobeyed him. A horseback preacher divorced her on the spot. Her brothers, uncles and father all pleaded with her to stop. Finally, her brothers carried the bicycle home on horseback. Did you win the race? No, but she borrowed a bike and continued the race. - No, she was left behind. - No, she finished the race. - Left behind. - She finished the race. I came over to buy household goods. I had tied a knot on every finger for various items. I bought everything save this last one. I can't remember this one... ...no matter how hard I try. Make sure you tie them tightly! Can you think of anything I might have left out? Let's have a look. It's getting late. Let's go. I have to leave now. But you promised us tea. it was not destined. Don't leave anything behind. The last item was it a sewing machine? No! May be a rice-cooker? Mirror and candelabra? By the way, madam. What was your name? Hoora.
