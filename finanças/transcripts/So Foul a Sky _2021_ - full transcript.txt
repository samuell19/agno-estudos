[Guaidó] As the President of Venezuela's National Assembly... Citing Article 187 from our Constitution... [Maduro] Now they pretend to enforce a parallel government. A government of clowns. Such a clownish stunt from the Right wing... I swear as President of Venezuela... ...and formally take on the task... ...miserable on how they murder our youth and our people..." Go rot in hell! To the Venezuelan people... ...nobody gives orders! [Maduro] Donald Trump says... ...that he is thinking on imposing a quarantine against Venezuela. No ship comes in or out. A blockade! A criminal and illegal threat by Trump... ...of a maritime blockade against Venezuela. Venezuela as a whole rejects Donald Trump's statements! I say to Donald Trump... ...you won't topple us! Our seas will be free, sovereign and independent! And I will navigate through them... Attention to all personnel, this is a maneuver. Battle stations. Personnel, call to action all stations.

I can't hear anything! What do you want me to tell you! What do you do over there? Do they call you? Not everyone leaves happy... There is no money, man! This thing is tough! Anyways, they will give us a hard time. Asking how many days are we staying... ...because there is always a Brazilian guy who falls in love. ...you got an inflation rate of nearly one million percent... [Maduro] Now, I am not denying that thousands of Venezuelans have left. I believe 600,000 or 900,000 in a migration over the last years... What do you want? A permit. Where are you traveling? Boa Vista, Brazil. What are you gonna do? Work. To look for a job? You can't. Excuse me? - You can't. You got to regularize your status in the country. You can't work otherwise. Can't I work? Is this your first time coming to Brazil? Yes. You can stay for 60 days. Two months. Before those two months expire... ...you got to stamp your exit from Brazil... ...so you don't get fined. Understood? The fine for each overdue day is 100R$. Per day. OK? OK... Talk to me, mother. And by calling you so... ...I say... ...that no woman has ever been what you are to me. Talk to me.

We are not asking you to fire your weapons... We are asking not to shoot us. Defend with us the right our people has to be listened and free. [Maduro] They arrogantly believe they own our country... We would never surrender! What couldn't be done through votes, we will achieve with our weapons! We'll liberate our homeland! Alert! An exiled Venezuelan Military cell... ...denounces the seizure of the Presidency by Nicolás Maduro... ...and recognize Juan Guaidó as their legitimate Commander in Chief. Nicolás Maduro assured that if Venezuela... ...sinks into political violence, it will have to be liberated with weapons. [Maduro] They are ordering high ranking Army officers... ...to join their coup! And of deep respect for our oath to defend our people. And to comply with and enforce the laws of the Republic. Good morning Venezuela! ...in order to pressure Maduro's exit. This is an invasion against our land. ...and when you step foot here, we are coming for you. [Maduro] How far this madness, lies, and manipulations will go? Chancelor, I truly believe... ...there has never been such a crazy government in the USA. So much hatred inside them! Mr. President you are not answering my question Is Colombia willing to receive US troops in its territory? ...yes or no... I'm talking to you as a child from a homeland... ...just like any other. A father like any other. Voracious Saturn. A State. All of them. [Maduro] Mr. Trump was erupting with lies... This week we will have to buy more barrels. It is getting hairy over there! I don’t' think we will be able to fill them up. We should even fill our pockets. Even the teacups and all at home has to be filled up! Your Uncle Maduro says... ...there are gasoline reserves for only twenty days. Now he is gonna collect signatures... ...and take them to Washington. Those are signatures from people gifted CLAP Food Boxes. [Maduro] Even with the Devil himself I am ready to talk. Quito! Ask if they sell cigarettes over there! Hurry up! They don't have any? What? Buy... around five! Or a pack! Bring a pack! It is worth 2,000 COP 2,000COP or 3,000COP? One pack, Quito! I had loose change over here, what did I do with it? Ask for a small pack. How much is it? 300COP? Buy a 2,000COP one. Three, six, nine, twelve... Three, six, nine, twelve, fifteen, eighteen, Three, three... six. I am calling Alex to check on today's gasoline price. It's time to negotiate it. What's up!? Tell me today's rates, man! Fuck... always with that cheap rate of yours. Shit, and us here struggling with our President Maduro... ...just to we give away our gasoline. Ready? All right! We are on our way now. Call you back once I am closer. Filiponga! You know he is my spotter. Done. Pass me one of those things, man! Wanna spit some smoke, for fucks sake. They didn't even have beer! They are not Lucky Strike, but even if they are fakes it's all good. Venezuela's oil reserves are immense, however they are not being exploited... PDVSA is refining less than 1 millions barrels per day... hence, Socialism... I speak from the frontiers of a desert which was once a savanna. A vulture disguised as an eagle. A severed tree. Desolate land. Dry roots. Without history... ...bronze heroes... ...or colorful flags. Orphaned from dissonant anthems... ...immortal symbols. Offspring of the dust and the dew. Of what is nameless. Son of a bitch, you are owing me. You haven't paid me today! It is broken. It has to be thrown away. There is a lot of barrels. How many are left? Move the barrels over there, c'mon! Stack them on this side. And afterward put them over here. That load over there. So there is no barrel mix up. They shot around like crazy, right? Tell me! Yes. What's up over there? Let me find out. There are some soldiers, man. Soldiers over there, right over there! Tell Jose to stay alert! There are soldiers around. Stay awake on the wheel! What if they pass by and break in? I am getting there. You look like a fool. Look! The snake is over there! Throw it over there! Saturday, Sunday... ...and today, Monday. You are leaving this afternoon. Yes, we can't leave too early because of the tracks. What happens to the tracks in Sinamaica at night? It is at night! After 11 a.m the tracks... So, at the same time we are leaving. Do we go home and drive back to Paraguaipoa? We die in Paraguaipoa! Did the gasoline price go down? Did it drop? It went down a tiny bit, right? From 15 to 14,000 COP. Yes! This guy said the same yesterday. But well... ...the important thing is to sell it, imagine otherwise... If we can't sell it... But we have emptied the truck which arrived loaded. Cousin, with those barrels... Our first one today! Do you know how much gasoline I lost yesterday? One and a half barrels worth of gasoline. But is it because of the useless excess? Yes! The useless excess is too much! Cousin, I tell them not to sell. Because I only get 20L worth of gasoline per every 160L barrel we sell. The thing is that you are a dwarf! No, that thing is way too low! Are you gonna have another shot of whiskey? No, I already drank them all. Couldn't you sell it? That gasoline is worth nothing in Maracaibo... Don't they pay anything at all? They fill it out from the gas station. I think they only pay for the load from the station. And over there gasoline is free. Yesterday I sent nine barrels and they couldn't sell them. Our turtle stew is ready! Go for it! Grab it! This sobers you up all at once. Must be eaten with all its grease... Good thing those fools haven't come by. But do they come to fuck around, or what? To bother us. To hassle! One has energy for the rest of the day after this meal. You can last for the whole day. Sober! It really sobers me up all day long. Matter of fact, I haven't slept in the last two days. What are you talking about!? You don't eat turtle in Venezuela, right? No, it's rare. In Sinamaica you see it, though. In Sinamaica, but in the sea. How much is a portion like that? Over there, if you fished it, you eat it. But don't they sell it? You rarely see it for sale. But, don't you also cook it this way? It is only at sea when they fish it, they might sell it. Do you eat it like this, though? No. They stew it... I had it fried. Fried is tasty! Fried is the same as this, stewed! This turtle is such a banquet, right!? And the turtle crackling? Doesn't it lower your blood pressure? The turtle stew was delicious. Got me all horny! Ready to fuck any female passing by! I speak to you as the child of a homeland. As an orphan. I talk from the depths of a lake with black water... ...dark bottom... ...muddy sand. Freed from masks... ...identities... ...and duties. A pirate furrowing through the air. Steel giant. A horse galloping over the waters.
