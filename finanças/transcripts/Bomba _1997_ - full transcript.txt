NIKOLA-FILM Igor KALYONOV presents a Dmitry MESKHIYEV film Starring: Ivan NEISTOVY (Viktor BYCHKOV) Aleksandr POLOVTSEV Yuri KUZN ETSOV Sonya NEVZG LYAD (Olga TOLSTETSKAYA) Vasilina STRELNIKOVA Vera GOLODNAYA (Olga TARASENKO) Written by Sergey RADLOV Director of Photography Sergey MACHILSKY Production Designer Natalya KOCHERGINA Music by Yevgeny PUSSER Produced by Igor KALYONOV Directed by Dmitry MESKHIYEV THE BOMB It's the 13-th year now. It means I've been working on this machine for 15 years. I need to make it clear to those undergoing the test. God damn this shyness of mine. Okay. I'll put it like this. The machine is designed to accumulate sexual energy. This energy flows to certain spheres, which turn into powerful bombs. Radiation kills individuals' psyches... ...urging them to join in revolutionary struggle. I'll talk about the way it works, its detectors and wires at the dacha. And should by no means forget about orgasm! All right. Comrade Lyuba. Comrade Varvara. Comrade Olga. May I start? Sure. Hi. Comrades, for millions of years mankind has been trying to create a device for accumulating life energy. And finally such a device has been invented by our contemporary. I'll leave out the details of its specifications, you'll have a chance not just to see it but to try it on yourselves. Right, and... And you'll realize it's a real breakthrough, 'cause each of you will create your own sphere, containing your sexual energy. And this sphere is a kind of bomb. However, don't have any fear - this bomb is a bomb of creation rather than of annihilation. We'll make real revolutionaries out of common, slack folks. Look, those who accumulate energy within themselves instantly turn into dirty pigs. Comrades, I need to warn you. There's one word, which totally disagrees with my guts - this is the word "orgasm". As for you, comrade Lyuba, I'll give you an individual warning. Only you demanded to be paid for participating in this experiment. What wrong did I do? So shy, so modest. Are you okay, comrade Olga? Then, comrades, time to get it going and head to the station. Move it. Wait. Let's have a rest. Where are these gals? Fallen behind. We're going too fast. Fallen behind... And we're to carry all these supplies for them, God damn it. They took so many fancy clothes with them. Like they're on vacation. Cool it, Yakov. We're gonna need them for important business. For business, huh? You better be right. - A dacha rented with the party money? - Yes. - We paid the whore, didn't we? - Right. If it doesn't work, you'll be held responsible for it. Remember, you're taking the fall. What do you mean "if it doesn't work"? I've sweated over it for 15 years! If it's a flop, I'll have nothing more to live for. Help yourselves, ladies-revolutionaries. May I have one? I offered it myself, didn't I? Why ask for permission? Let's go on a first-name basis. We'll be together for this ordeal for a week. Why "ordeal"? I trust comrade Boris. He is... I could say what I think of him. But I'll spare you. So no harsh words. It is fair? To turn the girl on and not let her get a kick out of it? Wants to have just our energy, bastard! - Lyuba, you don't get it. - Yes, I get it. We're gonna sacrifice all our life juices for the cause of liberation. Hold, there's some beast over there. Quiet. - Let's go check it. - Too scary. Someone is being devoured there. Wrong, not devoured but fu... Oh! I almost said it. Actually, we should've charged them more. To stay here a week. All stressed-out. And not a word of complaint. Let's go! Wait! Girls, this is a man! If there are such species around we're not gonna die out. And the experiment? To hell with the experiment. Let's go! Okay. Hi. Girls, why hide? This is bad manners to peep. You say bad manners? Varvara, come out of there. Make a curtsey. Hi. Who's there? Who do I see there? Comrade Olya, let me have your boobs. My boobs? Comrade researcher, maybe mine will do for you? Okay. Comrade Yakov. Yes? Come up to comrade Lyuba and grab her boobs very gently. Start caressing them clock-wise. How are you feeling? Fine, thanks. You'll have to kiss her boob right on the nipple. Will you do it? I'm a revolutionary fighter, right? Girls, I don't know what to say! But I dig it! Last year I had a relationship with a manager from Yeliseyev's store... Cut your dirty stories, comrade Lyuba. Quiet! Yasha, and now the other boob. Stop! Good job, Lyuba. There's my girl! We got 1.5 buts of energy. Congratulations, comrades! Comrade Boris, and what is this little thing? To have everything under control, sweet Varya. A human being is so imperfect, do you understand it? And I need to give you all a word of warning, comrades. If you're going to enjoy yourselves instead of working hard... What do you mean? I can't get any pleasure out of it? Right. No way! Why are we all here? Look, inventor, let's check your device for safety's sake. What will you say, Moustache? Boris is the boss here. No need to check it. No malfunction within the range of the dacha. This is your room. The bed. The detector is under the pillow. Always at hand. You just lie down and feel good. - Are you okay? - Feels so good. Okay, I'll leave you alone. Don't worry about the machine, it's always at hand, so you may just lie down and relax. The device is constantly under your head. And that's it. Lyuba. Lyuba, sweetie. "Oh, my entrance hall in the cabin, "My new entrance hall, "My new quaint entrance hall, built of maple tree..." "But he never loved, "No, he never loved, "No, he never loved me..." "Oh, my entrance hall in the cabin, "My new entrance hall..." - Are you okay? - Somethings wrong with her. - With Olga? - Right, with Olga. What the hell are you doing?! Get out of here. Quick. You'll get it from me! - Yasha, darling! - Let go of me, whore! Yakov, wake up! It's me, Boris. Olga yielded two buts. Can you imagine this? - Good for her! - Boris, it worked. Look. This is Varya's output. Why are you here, comrade Boris? So you're comrade Boris' brother? - Her breathing is not smooth. - Is it good? It is great, Yakov. You won't hurt me, will you? Now our major task is not to let her discharge herself. No way. I'll take care of this, okay? No, wait, Too early. Come here! This is not right, comrade Yakov. You'll cause damage to their psyches, acting like this. Varya, dear, don't you cry, calm down. Everything's fine. Come on, two more buts of your energy, please! Of my energy? Right. Of your energy. Understand? Yes, I do. I don't understand. Comrade Boris, I got tons of this energy, help me give it away. No problem. But how? Say "kuoki". I don't get you. Kuoki. Kuoki? Come on, kiss me, caress me. Do it! - Do you hear me? - Yes. I hear you, Varya. Get undressed. No way, Varya. There's a line, which we can't cross. But unless we cross it, we'll never know where it lies. And if we know where it lies, we'll never be scared of it. Varya, I feel kind of weird. Why, Varya?! Why?! Varya, Stop it! Why are you doing this?! What's wrong, Yasha? You know, what's wrong, Boris! Do you hear all this noise? That was close... Let's get out of here. Comrade Lyuba, lean forward and don't bend your knees. Don't bend them, okay? There you go. One, two. - So he just walked out on you, right? - Right. And I thought: What's this firing about? And his cock? Did it get hard or something? It got hard all right, Lyuba. Look, what are they doing, bastards? What are they doing?! Cut it! And now inhale deeply. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale. Exhale. Enough for the work-out. I got a question. - May I ask it? - Shoot. Comrade Yakov, are you supposed to turn us, poor darlings, on looking like this? What is supposed to turn us on? This pine-tree? You can pick anything to turn you on. We don't limit your fantasy. Each of you may have her own path. Let's take comrade Varvara. She's excelling at dreams. - Dreams... - I'll tell you about dreams. If you start firing at nights, we'll be having nightmares, not dreams. We need to get a better outfit for comrade Yakov. What's this? So old-fashioned. Olya! Yes, yes. And you, too, comrade Boris. Your clothes look so worn out. I need to see a romantic hero and not a guy in rags to get my emotions aroused. - Watch your tongue. - Hold it, Yakov. - How dare she to talk like this? - Wait. We should come up with something. We've come up with something, right? After breakfast we'll take care of your wardrobe. This is how things are. Yesterday we could hardly tear you away from this Varvara. Look, me too... I'm actually worried. Are we gonna endure it? I guess we are. We knew what we were doing, right? Comrades revolutionaries, now we'll dress you up. In what? Yasha, honey, try this on. Borya. Come on, Yakov. I can't. Your damned riding-breeches. - Don't you touch my breeches! - What? Look, comrade Boris. I undressed all my clients myself. Now you'll see how much noise your gadget will produce. Better remove your high boots. Girls, why are you standing there? Take care of the inventor... Can I help you? Pull your belly button in. Comrade Lyuba. I order you to stop. Borya. I can't take it any more. BOrya! Look at yourself, comrade Borya! Is it how a revolutionary fighter should look? I'm talking to you, damned pervert. I guess, comrade Yakov, you're not familiar with literature. What? You know, comrade Yakov, love can have so many different disguises. And if... those involved in the experiment want to see a stern Roman in you, and the priest of vice - in me, we need to be up to par and get over this petty pride of ours. Merci. I think, they're laughing at us. Come on, Yakov, everything's fine. We got 10 buts of energy already. And how many do we need? Wait. Do you hear this echo? What? I can't believe it. Have they escaped? You go left and I'll go right. Meeting right here in 30 minutes. Lyuba, honey! Varya, sweetie! Olya, sunshine! Girls! Who is it? Hi, young lady- Lost your girlfriends, right? Where do you see a young lady here? And you got guts. What? Come to me. Arrived here from town? And now living at the remote dacha? What do you want, mister? Take a seat. Come on, sit down. Look, mister. Why are you so edgy, huh? You're so skinny. Neither boobs nor buns. Never mind. I'll fatten you up. You'll be telling stories about Kharytonych then. Believe me. Here, have some milk. Look, I'm a man. You're so funny. I love it. Comrade Yakov! Comrade Yakov. Come on. You think I'm worse than this Yakov of yours? No, you are not... Don't talk too much. You better drink milk. You'll need your strength. You were sick, huh? Okay. Enough. Enough. Oh, look at you! So beautiful! Come on, don't be scared of me. Hey, just look at her! So those bastards lost us, right? Oh, Varya. I better go for a stroll now, okay? Not to be in your way. Sure. But you can stay. It's more fun, when we are three. No, I'm not ready yet. Hey, stop playing hide-and-seek! Get out of there! Now! Comrade Yakov! Freeze. - Freeze. Or I'll fire. - Comrade Yakov! Freeze! Did you hear me? Freeze! And you got a good appetite, huh? Okay, don't be in a rush. We have enough time. Listen, I'm a man, my name's Boris. Back in Kubelovka we had one gal. Her name was Moira. She was sweet like a cherry. Moira means "destiny". And there's no getting away from destiny, sweetie. Let me show you something. You, town girls, have such loose morals. First, chew it up, and then I'll kiss you. I bet We'll hit it Off. Gotcha, girlie. And where's your head garland, comrade Yakov? I lost it. Look at you, comrade Olya. You lost it? Too bad. I made it especially for you. Really? What a shame we're so far from the machine, comrade Olga. I guess you're exploding with energy now. Maybe it's no big deal, huh? Meaning? That we are far from the machine. Comrade Olga. Somethings wrong with me. Help! What's going on there? Help! The evil spirits! Can't give us a break, bastards. God save me. Hey you, with boobs, who are you? I'm Olya. Why in this shapeless garment? Are you a human or the devil? There is no devil. No way. These are just priests' tales. There is the devil. I bet. A girl with this thing is over there! How did you call me? Comrade? He also called me so. Get away from me, Satan! Get away from me! Get away from me, Satan! Comrade Boris. - Comrade Boris. - I'm here. What's wrong? I was raped. You're a real mess, Olya. What does it mean? Better look at yourself. I'll have to tighten the regime, lady comrades. We are not for a vacation here. Your today's flings and bad organization resulted in... sad CONSEQUENCES. Really sad consequences. Comrade Varvara... - What? - May I have you for a minute? Well done, Varya. Dancing, right? What? You mean we can't dance either? Our efforts don't go down the drain. Your machine is making so much noise. She's right. Check the meter. Have a drink, comrade Boris. I don't drink, comrade Lyuba. Come on, just one shot. I'm confused, comrades. Don't know what to do. I gotta go now. And undress comrade Olga. Oh, poor me! Right, undress her and show her that you're a real man! What crap have you pulled with this machine of yours? You'll see it yourself, comrade Lyuba. You'll realize all your sufferings were not in vain. Yakov. I'm going to comrade Olga now. And you go to the machine. Do you hear, comrade Olga? Yeah. I hear it, comrade Boris. Do you like me, comrade Boris? Just a little bit? Come on, answer me. You're a great friend, comrade Olga. I'll slip beads of pearl on a string, I'll surround you with halva, We'll submerge into this eternal deceit Existing between a man and a woman. You'll rush to me and wrap your hands around me. But you won't hang on me like a sack. I'll hold you tight and make you feel warm. And set you on my cock. We'll be crying and laughing, It'll be both painful and funny for us, And Mom will be teasing me, Wagging her finger at me. I'll meet you today in the night And walk you through the maze of dream. But this sheep-like dream Conceals the chaos of soul. "Oh, my entrance-hall in the cabin, "My new entrance-hall, "My new entrance hall, built of maple-tree!“ Comrade Boris, could you do me a favor? Yes, Olga, sunshine? Fuck me, I can't take it anymore. If you turn me down, I'll totally run out of energy. Honestly. - No kidding? - No kidding. I swear. What shall I do? What about our comrades? Our comrades? We'll keep them in the dark. This is for the benefit of our common cause, comrade Boris. Olya. Lyuba, sweetie. Varya, Olya, Lyuba... Come here. 35 buts, Boris! 35. A little more effort, and we are set for the first test. "Oh, my entrance-hall... "My entrance-hall... "My new entrance-hall... "My new quaint entrance-hall, made of maple-tree.“ Stop it, staff-captain, please. Don't do it. What is it? Staff-captain! "Lyuba" means "love" and she's mine! You're a jackass, lieutenant! Love can't belong to anyone. You are going to answer for it! I'll check what color your blood is. - Bring guns here! - Quick! Your honor. Let me take the lady away. Women shouldn't be witnesses to this. Thank you, Mitrych. Good-bye, my Love. We'll probably never meet again. They'll kill each other. So what? That's what military men are for. Their destiny is to shoot each other. Ours - to love each other. Like this? Like this. What's wrong, honey? Nothing. Here, check it out, not to get bored. This is a rubber toy. Called a condom. Not an ordinary one, but brought from overseas. For pleasure and safety. - Want this? With bumps and ribs? - Sure. I want it! Again? Mitrych, you abused my trust in you. It'll never happen again, your honor. Have mercy on me. Please. Stand up, when a higher in rank officer is talking to you! Don't you see, staff-captain, I just can't stand up? Then you'll die together. No! No! No! No! No! No! Yakov! Yakov! Olya, sweetheart, throw it to me. Throw something heavy at his head. - Lyuba, join us. - Lay off. Today you can do and say whatever you like. 8 buts in just one night! We couldn't believe our eyes. Another night like this and... I'll strangle you both. Lyuba, how can we restore your strength? Forget it. It's absolutely no way. Okay. Then throw a picnic party. "Oh, my entrance-hall in the cabin, "My new entrance hall, "My new quaint entrance-hall, built of maple-tree.“ Comrade Yakov, give me a smile, please. I've never seen you smile. - Why the hell should I smile? - Don't be a fun-killer. We're just relaxing, aren't we? Who knows? Maybe your smile will set free some new, so far unknown energy, hidden deep inside me. Yes, Boris? Yakov, it's worth giving it a shot. There's still much for us to explore. Come on, give me a smile, comrade Yakov. Did you hear that explosion? Produced at least 3 buts. Well done, Yasha! Come on. Good for you, girls. And one more time? Yasha, try it again. Something is going on there. I'll go check it. Comrade Varvara, follow me. Sure. Wait a minute. Move it. What a game they created, huh? Want to get a closer look at this machine. Oh, my! I don't think we can do it right here. Come on. That's okay. That's okay. Who are you, huh? Everyone knows me around here. Now I'll know you, too. Go, and don't pull any tricks on me. My gun is loaded. Move it. And you? Waiting for a special invitation? Go. Move it, move it. - Comrade Boris? - Yes? Want to see something? - Okay. - Give me some champagne first. Excuse me, Lyuba. The glass... - Look. - Yes. Meaning? - What's wrong, comrade Boris? - What do you say, comrade Boris? My head is swimming. Don't! - Want one more time. - Alright. - Bastard! - Why, Olya! Olya, sweetie, we're just fooling around. That's it. Sweetie? Don't you call me "sweetie"! You are a bitch! Cut it! Olya! Lyuba! Girls! Stop it. Who are you? Answer me. Secret Police? Psycho... Real psycho. I'm the master of the woods. I'm the master! Let us go. We don't care what games you're playing here. You say you don't care? Right? We got our own games to play. And don't care for yours. Then why are you walking around the house in circles? You're not answering me. Why did you remove pants from my friend? What did you want to find there? Girls! Olya, sweetie! Stop it! Varvara, I leave you in charge here. Here. These two are not to run away. And I'm going back to the wood. Hey, gal. Let us go, okay? We'll never get close to your house again. Promise. Stand up. Stay where you are. We're done. Look, at least let my gal go. - Sorry, Marfutka. - What are you doing? - Have to do it right in front of you. - What are you talking about? Got nothing to do, Marfutka. They got their weapons, we got - ours. Oh my, I'm gonna fire. I'm gonna... To shoot at such rare beauty? Marfutka, get out of here. I'll try to hold here for a while. You're no way gonna fire! That's it! You'll be running about the woods, seeking Khariton! - Gees, I'm firing! - There you go! There you go! Oh, I'm dying! - Are you gonna run about the forest? - Alright! Alright! Bitch! You're a fucking bitch! It was a joke! Cut it! Lay off me! You've been so mean to me! I'll never do it aga... Olga, come on, stop it! I was just teasing you. Why are you crying? I'm a bad girl. Don't cry. Having fun? I see. I felt it, Boris, that deep inside you're rotten like all intelligentsia. Stop yelling. What?! Why do you keep yelling all the time? Look, I'm gonna get... And who's saying this? Huh? You have no right to yell at a girl. It's really very tactless. You're fucking intelligentsia, not a fighter. Who is not a fighter? Comrade Boris is not a fighter? Oh my! I'm gonna fire! To fire is a big sin. Don't you dare do this. I won't let you fire! No way! Okay, we'll deal with this. Let's go help Varvara. Stop firing, comrade Varvara! Where's the arrested guy? He walked out on me. "He begged me to be his, "So I'll be living...“ Comrade Varvara, what have you been doing with the arrested guy? Pour some water over her, please. Have you been doing it, Varya? You've reached orgasm! Yes, I have. I've reached orgasm. How could you be so careless when every but counts?! When almost everything is set for the experiment! That's it! Enough of these admonitions! All of you will stay home under house arrest. Borya, honey... This damned wild hog screwed up everything. Tomorrow I was planning to hold the first test in Petersburg. I think, Yakov, you'll actually manage to do it. What? Check Olga's detector. Let's keep our fingers crossed that no one scares her off. Colleague, I know a more effective medication for hypochondria than these pills. I think I know what you're talking about. But it's way too risky, her husband is so jealous. He got all experts in hypochondria castrated. We are the only ones left intact. I heard this saying from one of my Russian patients. I don't remember its ending. But the beginning is just fantastic: No pain... I'm sorry, I... Don't be a coward... I may need your assistance. Better hand me brush #1. Rip off the left No, better the patients right nipple. - Maybe, both? - Don't ask me stupid questions. I'm sorry, colleague. Check her pulse. - Her pulse has quickened. - Great. Brush # 2, please. Oh, and now you... Don't hesitate, dear... Quiet, for God's sake. Quiet. More, doctor. Please. More. I'm worried about one question, colleague. Will I as usual stay just a witness to the process of treatment or you'll permit me to be part of it, too? I'm desperate to have a bit of pleasure. She's so gorgeous! You'll get your pleasure! Unforgettable pleasure! No, no, no! Look, Borya, look! I see, Yasha, I see! It worked. Borya, I'm setting off right away. Acting in accordance with the plan. Be expecting news by tomorrow evening. Read it. - Again? - Read it, I say! Well... A state of emergency has been introduced in Petersburg. As victims report, crowds of hooligans are terrorizing women, committing acts of sexual harassment. And what do they want? What do they want? That's the question. This is a question only for you. It's written there in black and white. Women are strongly recommended against going outside for fear of being raped there. Calm down, Borya. The article says that the surge of riots is gradually subsiding. The authorities hope to get control over the situation very shortly. Why haven't they put forward any political or social demands?! Why on earth should they have done this? What kind of energy did you get from us? Political? I got nothing political down there! I bet girls got nothing political there, either! You're totally ignorant! Energy of life is universal! Why talk to you anyways! That's it. We're leaving! If I'd known it would end up like this, I would've never got involved! Quit this experiment or you'll wind up in Siberia. Girls, let's go pack our things. Yakov? Boris... Borya, I was going through the forest... They confiscated the sphere. No big deal, Yakov. We got another problem. The result is really bad. The result is really fantastic. You're a genius! The town was practically paralyzed. One sphere lasted out the whole day. We are to proceed with the experiment. But my ultimate goal was totally different. The more so as the girls are leaving. No one is leaving anywhere. Comrade Boris, put a spare sphere in the machine. Comrade Yakov, what's wrong with you? With me? Nothing's wrong. Lyuba, sunshine, play the gramophone. Let's dance. Okay, but your gun... The entrance-hall. "Oh, my entrance-hall in the cabin, "My new entrance hall, "My new quaint entrance-hall made of maple-tree...“ Yakov, did you get away from the sphere at once when you opened it? I was near it, for the back-up. Didn't I warn you that its close radiation is hazardous for psyche. No way. It's not hazardous. Quite the contrary. It's very nice. Gives you a boost. Get undressed. Quick! This is really bad, girls. He's gone nuts. Get undressed. Girls. Come on, dance for me, huh? I put my ass on the line. We're dancing. Don't shoot! I put my ass on the line. "Oh, my entrance-hall in the cabin, "My new entrance-hall, My new quaint entrance-hall, built of maple...“ Oh, we got company! Come on in. Are you nuts? Comrade Yakov, we're naked. So what? Now we're all gonna be naked. Again with a gun? Can't relax without a gun, right? We're not relaxing. Very important revolutionary mission's underway here. Okay, all newcomers get undressed! Yakov, and what about secrecy? To hell with secrecy. Now all are involved ...in this experiment. Girls, remove your clothes, please? Or he'll shoot me right away. Girls! It's so very exciting in here. And what is this? Comrade Yakov, I'm busting you. You violated secrecy provisions. You're a mental case, you made an orgy out of this idea! Fuck you, Boris. This sounds good. Put down this gun. Or I'll hit you. And I got very big fists, you know. Don't hurt him, please. Stay away from me, or else... What? We've won. While I'm alive, I'll never let you even touch this machine. Girls, go find a rope. We need to tie up this madman. Why are you being so stupid? Can't you understand it's the biggest achievement of the revolution! It's bullshit. First I thought it's fun. But you launched this disgusting orgy in town. And treated these gorgeous girls so badly! We need to switch them off or we can't tie him up. Comrade Olga, I trusted you. I really trusted you. Girlies, pull at them and they'll drop off. You are bitches! You're real bitches! Lay off me! Thank you, sweetie. Girls, tie up this nutcase. Stop it! What are you doing? Someone is thinking of me now. You screwed it up, Varvara. So typical of you. Do you like it, Kharytonych? Good for you. I've already told you this. But the reason was kind of different. Never hurt a living being. Don't pull so hard. Do it tenderly and gently. - Got it? - Right. I got it, Kharytonych. Good. Stupid. Woke up? Are you going to take a swim? And with Olga? Olga will stay with you. But make sure you do nothing foolish. And the rest of the gals will be staying here with me. They'll attend to household chores. The house is so big. Enough room for everyone. Why you got petrified, buddy? Or you can't enjoy life without your damned machine? Comrade Boris! No "comrades" here. Remember it! Varya, dear, and you? I'll stay with Kharytonych. Lyuba, sunshine, and you? Kharytonych has enough strength for everyone, right? Right. Kharytonych, I'm asking for your special attention to me, as I'm the biggest victim of their experiment. You wanna say I'm not a victim? Stop shouting! It's not a commune here! And what's gonna be here, Kharytonych? Earthly paradise!
