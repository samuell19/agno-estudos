Do you remember? How's that? Better for you? My feet won't move. That's normal for now. You were in a coma for a long time, and your muscles are extremely weak. But there are people here who are gonna take care of you, and they'll help you get better. I'm also here to help you. I remember you. That's good. That's good. And do you remember what happened last night, by any chance? You had another panic attack. So what's scaring you? The monster. Thomas, there is no monster. It's just your memories returning. Your memory is being restored. Do you understand? You do remember why you're here, right? No. I've already told you. Do you want me to repeat it? Hmm. Very well. You experienced something terrible within your home. It's been three years. Your parents, Betty and Marc, they were murdered, shot to death. Your cousin Dylan was also there. He was shot and then strangled. You, Thomas, were discovered on the brink of death with a knife in your stomach. You were 16 when it happened. The year is 2001. You are 19. Can you hear me? Thomas? Thomas, look at me. Thomas. Thomas, stay with me. Take my hand. And squeeze as hard as you can. Thomas? Squeeze my hand, please. Go on. Squeeze my hand, please. Laura. - What? - Laura. Where's my sister? You should discuss that with your shrink, okay? Right now, it's time to work. Squeeze my hand. Go on, Thomas. Do what I'm doing. Good. Yes. Harder. Squeeze a bit more? Okay, good. Let go. Let go now. Loosen your grip. Thomas, let go. Okay. Good. So, Thomas was just asking about his sister Laura. I, uh, think he remembered something. I thought it was important for you to know. Yeah, thank you. Don't hurt my sister. Why would I hurt your sister? Is she here? No. - Laura's not here. - Where is she? You told your physical therapist that your sister was with you on the night of the murders. Is that right? She's innocent. I'm not the police, Thomas. They will come question you. But we have some time before, you and I, to understand whatever happened. Where's my sister? Where is she? Let me see her. Thomas, listen to me. Laura's disappeared. What? Your sister went missing. I can help you remember. We need to know what happened. There was a terrible storm the night it happened. The neighbors told us that the thunder was shaking the house. They found you at dawn, laying on the floor of the living room, with the knife in your stomach. Your house is located at 7 Crow Street. The house where you live. With your family. It's a nice house. With a little yard. There are large bay windows, two floors. And… stone walls. Are any images coming back to you? Yes. Tell me what it is you see. The house. Is someone there with you? Yes. Laura. What's she like? She's beautiful. No, don't go. Laura, no! I'm here with you. Go on. Do you want me to get caught? Stop calling my home. I gave you the store's number, so use it. Tomorrow. I don't know. That's strange, an empty room in a house. Is there something in the room that you don't want to see? No, no, she's fine with it. I can leave the store early, you know. There's no business these days. - Everything's gone to hell. - Mm-hmm. It's apocalyptic. Exactly. Just look outside. Do you see? Oh, so you're hungry? Yeah. All right. Well, take a seat then. You want some meat? Yeah, thank you. Bread? Thanks. Can you hold your plate? The pasta may have been cooked too long. I hope you enjoy. Thank you. What's so funny? Nothing's funny. I'll be right back. Don't say anything. Okay. Everything good? Mmm, just fine. From you? What for? You'll see. Look. You like? Something wrong? No. Well? Leave it. It'll stop. It's too much. Stay at the table. I said stay at the table! Does anyone want, uh, some more pot roast? We… We need to finish the roast. It's fine. We'll finish it tomorrow. That dog just never stops, does he? Can't stand that mutt. What does Laura mean to you? Everything. We'll pick this back up another day. Memories will likely continue to resurface outside of our sessions. Accept them, hmm? I don't want you to fight these. But I will ask one thing. Unless I'm here, don't try to force your recall. You're not fully recovered. It could cause you to… to mix up past and present. To mistake your memories for reality. Understand? It's important. Yeah. Thank you. - Good night. - See ya. I'll remove this. You don't need it anymore. Your first time in the chair might be a bit painful. All right? Hello. Hey there. - How are you? - How are you? Hey! - Hey, where are you taking him? - Physical therapy. But that's in his room. Uh, he has an appointment. Are you sure? I’m sure, yeah. - Is his doctor here? - What's with all the questions? It's nothing. Forget about it. Point your toes to the ceiling. Here we go. Easy. There. Don't force it, Thomas. Don't force it. Okay, that's good. Relax. Try not to lift your feet. Just point the toes, okay? Go ahead. One more time. Okay, that's good. Relax. Take a breather. That's really good, really. Bastien! You have to try. Look at everyone else. See? They're trying. You have to push yourself. Otherwise, I can't help you. Thomas. Let's move to the mat. Okay. Does that feel good? One more. There. Now on to the knee. - There we go, bend. - Come on. - And extend. There. - That's great. Come on, bend one last time. And extend your leg. Great. Thomas? I'm gonna prop you up a little. Come on. Hold your head up as best you can. Thomas? Thomas, what's wrong? Thomas, where does it hurt? Thomas? - Hey, a little help here, please. - What's going on? - Relax. I don't know. - Prop him up. I'm… I'm trying. Thomas. Relax. Let your head drop, Thomas. - It'll be okay. - Thomas? Thomas? Thomas? You're safe here. I promise. No one is coming to hurt you. He was here. I saw him. And yet, you are the only one who saw him. - It's a mirage produced by your brain. - No. - It's not reality. - He's coming for me. - It’s a hallucination. - Why don't you believe me? - It's not that. - Why won't you believe me? He took Laura, and now he's coming for me. What do you mean he took Laura? Do you remember something? He was waiting outside. Shut up, dog! It's him. What are you doing? You're coming to my home now? My mother said she didn't want to see you anymore! Go away! Go away! Don't ever call again! Let's go back inside. What happened? - Betty, is that you? - Shh. What's the matter? Hey, what's wrong? Answer me. Nothing. Not nothing. You're covered in blood. I got hit by a car. Is that good enough for you? Go get cleaned up before your mother sees. Where did the cuts come from? I don't know. What? It stings? No. It's numb. Marc, it's me. What's the matter? You afraid of me too? Maybe. What is it that frightens you about Laura? Does she sometimes lose her temper and become violent? No. You sure? She didn't do anything. Explain how you can be so certain when you've forgotten what happened? - It's him. - Him? Your mother's lover? Yes. He would hurt her. Did this man hurt Laura? Thomas? I don't know. Then who? There. Very good. I'm right here, okay? I got ya. See? You're walking. Whoa, there! Hang on, hang on, hang on, I'm here. There. - Let's go. - No, I want to keep going. - No, Thomas. - I want to keep going. No, we're stopping. You did a great job. Here we go. - Let go. - No, Thomas. Stop. Let me go. Let me go. - Come see. - What? Two planes. They just crashed in New York. - Wait, what? - They crashed into those towers. It's insane. Hundreds dead. It's all over the TV. It's just awful. Come see. It's on TV. - Come on. - Okay, one sec. We'll leave you guys for two minutes, okay? Uh, if you need any of us, we're just behind that door, all right? - Did they say the twin towers? - Oh my gosh. - My sister lives in New York. - Is it just in the United States? What's your story? Is it bad? Someone tried to kill me. They stabbed me. But I don't know who. I forgot. And you? Your family? They're dead? My parents are dead too. And my sister's missing. We're kind of the same. What's going on? Did you move by yourself? Thomas, you can't move when I'm not here. Is that clear? Yeah. Is it bad, the news? Yeah. Really bad. What's wrong with your leg? Just an accident. Car accident? Now why would you think it was a car accident? Could you please shut the door? Why was he staring? She's not looking at you. It's me. How come you're not with Laura? She's elsewhere. No, I think you were with her then. You followed her, didn't you? Where were you really? You're laughing at me? No. Hey, everything's fine. I like being with you. Oh yeah? I really do. You're different than the others. You're special. Stop! You're hurting me! Fuck. What the hell was that? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. Don't touch me! Leave me alone. Leave me alone! I need you to stay with her. Stay with her. That's good, Thomas. You're making progress. Will I walk soon? At this rate, I'd say pretty soon, yeah. And Bastien? Don't worry about Bastien. Worry about you, okay? All right, see you. Bastien? Bastien! Thomas! - What are you doing? Thomas? - No, no, wait. Look. Now toss it back. That's good, Bastien. That's very good. That's good, Thomas. That's really good, guys. Okay. Nice, Thomas. Nice. That's really good. Okay, I'm gonna take the ball. But why? Because I said so. You know what? I'll take you back, Bastien. Great. Thank you. Laura! Honey, where are you? Laura! Okay, Laura, this isn't funny anymore. Laura! Laura? Laura. Oh God. Laura, run! Laura? Laura! - Wait! - Don't move! Come back! Wait! Laura? Laura! Stay still! Laura! Laura! Open the door! Laura! Open up, Laura! Open it! It's you. It's you! - Where's Laura? - Stay still! Stop! What'd you do to her? - Where is she? - Shut the fuck up! Mom! Can't you see this is all your fault? Thomas. I asked around and can assure you there were only female nurses on last night's shift. That's impossible. I'm sorry, Thomas, but I think you're mistaken. - But look at my arm. - Well, you had a panic attack, and so a nurse had to administer a sedative. - Look. - No. It's written right here. Jessica, three in the morning. Listen, I know what I saw. I wasn't dreaming. - You're forcing your recall. - He knows where Laura is. - You're getting everything mixed up. - He's the one! We're getting nowhere with this. What? Well… You won't focus. Do you know what happened? Do I know what happened? You know what happened. You know where Laura is. What I know is a lot of parts are still murky. I don't get it. There's the gun, for example. And also, Dylan. He came to your house for a few days before the tragedy. Do you think your cousin has anything to do with all this? Don't just stand there. Need a hand? No, it's fine. You don't want the ball? Why? You play? No. There you go. It's not hard. Are you ready, sweetie? Get everything? What's the matter? I don't get it. Tell me why you're shipping me off. Oh, because they're family. But I want to stay with you. Please, don't do this. But why? I can… I told you. I can get a room near the hospital. I'll sleep there. I'll come see you. I don't mind. - Please, just listen to me. - Dylan, no. Three weeks. What's three weeks? You know… You coming with us is how you can help your mother. Is that okay? You said this is our family? We never see them. We don't even know them! That's true. He's not wrong. But now we're here. - We're here. - All right. It's about time you go. You've got a long drive. You're right. Take care of yourself. - Take care of my son. - I will. - I'll call you the minute we get there. - Mm-hmm. Dylan. Give me a kiss. Mama. Give me a kiss. I love you. - I love you too. - I love you. I love you, Mom. Ready to leave? Hey, wait, sis. This is for you. Thank you. What is it? Come and look. Dylan, come on. Is that Dad? Mm-hmm. Oh, my princess. - Love it. - So cute. Wow. And Dylan! Come see! Look! You said we're not a real family, but look. See, we were all together. You're adorable! Oh. Is that me in your stomach? Mmm. Hold on! What's after that? - Where's me? - Thomas, we should go. Am I not in here? Mom, where am I? - Mom, where am I? - Hey, that's enough! Time to go. It's crazy how much snow you get. Right? Like Christmas. It just doesn't melt. Can I put on some music? Do you mind? - If we put on some music? - No. Ray's new dog grooming salon. Open six... Those who call their teacher "mom" … Oh, wait. Yeah. Yes. Can we turn it up a little? Oh my God. You okay? You okay? Dumb bitch! You're fucking lucky! Hey, don't cry, Mom, okay? Please stop. - Hey, don't cry. - Just stop. - Leave me alone. - Don't cry. Don't cry, Mom. What do you feel? Nothing. Nothing. You can hold my hand if you want. Anna. Anna! You okay? Did you spend the night? What's going on? They're here. They want to see you. I'll be back. It's clearly repressed memory. It's just a matter of how long it takes to put the pieces together. Maybe it's the opposite of solipsism. He's so concerned about the other he forgets himself. What are you doing? - Nothing. - Go. Excuse me? I'm not kidding. Get out. I'll finish and come down. - You don't get it. You need to get out. - Hey, whoa, easy. Take it easy. You think I'm crazy? You think I'm crazy, don't you? What's wrong with that dog? Just rabies. Get out of here. Well, it's the truth. Then put him to sleep. Hmm? Why can't we be in here? We're not allowed, that's why. That's stupid. This would make a great bedroom. It'd be better than the basement. What's going on? What happened? Did they find Laura? - We don't have much time left. - It's over? They found her? We need to make progress now. Tell me what you need. Anna. I know where the gun came from. Well, you sure were hungry! - Mm-hmm. - Want some more? - No, thanks. - Look at all that's left. Come on! Just a little, then. It's my pleasure. Yeah. Thank you, Betty. Do you feel at home downstairs? It's fine. Well, if there's anything we can do… Don't worry, it's fine. That's great, then. But what about upstairs? What about it? Really? I thought it'd be a great bedroom. - That it was "dumb" to leave it like that. - I didn't say that. It's fine, Dylan. Don't worry. - Oh, don't you believe me? - Don't start. What about you, Dad? I said don't start! Say you're sorry. - Say you're... - Fuck! Stop it! He did say that. Okay, then. - We'll talk about it later. - What are we gonna talk about? Perfect timing. Would you like me to answer it? You and I need to talk. Thomas, stop that. Why do you care? Is it that one guy? Is she still with him? I said stop. Oh yeah? He's family, right? He has a right to know. I said stop! Dylan? It's your mom on the phone. It'll be all right. You need to believe in her. I know her. I know she'll fight. She'll fight, and she'll win. We're almost there. And I'm really sorry about tonight. It wasn't exactly cheerful. It's all right. You good? Yeah. My mother's weird, huh? I don't think so. It's not like how it is at your place. I know. What do you mean you know? Well, what happened, and why they're like that. Oh. So, that means you know what my parents are hiding in their bedroom? No? What? A gun? A gun in a box. Hidden deep inside a closet. My father brought it here. I saw him. Years ago. It hasn't moved. It's still right there. You're so weird. No, really, it's the truth. Maybe he wanted to blow his brains out. Or kill Mom and him. Or kill all of us? It's not funny. Oh, come on, don't cry. You're safe. I have the bullets, and they'll never find them. You're safe. My mom is dying. She's not going to die. Does that fucking dog ever stop? Never. It's so annoying. Damn. I know. Laura? Laura? You there? You found me. What's with you today? Where's Bastien? Who? He's in a different group. - Why? - He just is. - Now, let's get to work. - No. "No"? Take me back to my room. Hello, Thomas. No, I don't want to see her. I want her gone. - Stop it! Let me go! Let me go! - Leave him. It's fine, thank you. Would you close the door behind you, please? Thank you. What's going on, Thomas? Talk to me. You were in the parking lot. - What? - You were there with the nurse. - What do you mean? - Tell me the truth. - Tell you what truth? - Tell me! - Can you walk, Thomas? - Tell me. - Are you saying you can... - Come on! Well… Uh, well, I spoke with the nurse. I needed to explain to him the important work we're doing together. You're lying. You think I'm stupid. No. Far from it. How am I supposed to trust you? Careful, Thomas. Don't project your anger onto me. It won't get you anywhere. Why are you putting these things in my head? I'm not putting anything in your head. I'm helping you remember. Look at me, please. - Let me tell you a story. - No. - An experiment, that is. - Get out. It was a long time ago. Emperor Frederick II… I want you to leave! Emperor Frederick II took six newborns. And he ordered the nurses to feed them, change them… But he instructed the nurses to never communicate with them, not even a cuddle. Basically, to never forge any bonds. - Can you guess what happened? - I don't give a fuck. Not one child lived. None. We can only survive by forging bonds. Don't break the one you have with me. I'm the only one you have. You're wrong. There's Laura. You have Laura? - Is she at your side right now? - That's enough. I know what it's like to grow up alone. We're done here. No. We'll continue. And I will tell you the truth. Laura is sick. - Laura suffers from behavioral issues… - Enough. - Stop it now! - …since she was a child. As she got older, these symptoms… - Stop it. I swear to God… - …only got worse. Is it fun for you to manipulate me? You are the one manipulating your memories. Why do you want to make me think my sister's the problem? You know what I see here? It's sad, really. I see a child whose traumatized parents didn't see him, who grew up alone and who transformed his suffering into violence. - Leave the room now. - Why was your father so defeated? - Stop it. - Why was your mother cold and distant? Why are you the only survivor? I am losing my patience. - And that empty room, whose is it? - Stop. Where's Laura? Where is she? I wish I knew. On the contrary, I think you're going to tell me now. Where's Laura? Where has she been since the start? Tell me. She's behind the wall. What's going on? It's the neighbor's dog. It's dead. All right, don't stay there. You shouldn't watch. Come on. Dylan, come on. I didn't do it. I didn't! Thomas, do you ever stop? I can't take this. Okay, Marc, hold him. Do something. Thomas, settle down. Ugh, he's giving me a headache. You're giving me a headache, Thomas. You know what I see? I see a child whose traumatized parents neglected him, who grew up alone… and who transformed his suffering into violence. - Stay with me, Mom! - Thomas, stop! Hey, Thomas! You stop that! Calm down. - Stop it! - Please, Mom! I told you to stay put! Stop! You're hurting me! What are you doing here? My mother said she didn't want to see you anymore! Go away! What did you do now? I got hit by a car. Is that good enough? - Go. - Excuse me? - I'm not kidding. Get out. - Fine. I'll finish here and come down. - Come on, you need to get out. - Hey, get off me! You need to believe in her. That's not funny. Leave me alone. ROOMS 301 to 306 ROOMS 307 to 312 Bastien! Bastien! Hey, wake up! Please wake up. Bastien, we have to leave here. We need to go. Now. What are you doing? Stop it. Stop. Bastien! Bastien, stop! Stop it! Bastien, stop it! Stop! Bastien, stop! I'm not gonna hurt you! Stop! - We have to leave this place! - Stop! - Come on, Bastien! - Shit! Stop it! Fuck! Are you okay? You all right? It's all right. It's over. I'm here. Just breathe. Just breathe. It's over. Dylan? What are you doing there? I told you it's off-limits. Mom? What are you doing? What's going on? Dylan is moving in. What? He doesn't want to be downstairs with you. But why? You always told me no one was allowed in that room. You killed the dog! - That wasn't me. - How could you do such a thing? No, I didn't kill it, Mom. That wasn't me. - I didn't kill it. - It's horrifying. You're horrifying. We'll make you better. We'll get you treatment. Mom. Mom! What did you tell them? - Marc. - Why did you say that? - Why did you say that? - I had to. - Why did you say that? - I had to tell them. - Calm down. - Dad, I didn't do anything, I swear. - Come on. - I swear, I didn't do anything. - I didn't kill it. It wasn't me. - Shh... Come on. I didn't kill it, Dad, I swear! - It's not true! - Stop! It wasn't me. I swear it's not true, Dad. I didn't kill it. You're scaring us, Thomas. Just leave us alone, please. You deadbeat. You're all pathetic! Just shoot me, then. Marc? Marc, was that you? Marc, what's going on? Fuck, Marc, answer me! Betty? Betty, what was that? Don't move. What are you doing? Thomas! Thomas, wait. - Don't move. - Wait, wait. - Thomas, Thomas! - Don't move. Wait, wait! - Open up. - Stop. - Stop, stop! - Open up. Open up! I'm so sorry. I'm begging you. I'm… I'm begging you. Don't do this. Help me! Did you know he could walk? Anna? I'm talking to you. Did you know he could walk? Okay, you knew. Do you realize he nearly killed him? No. No, I don't think he wanted to harm him. You're completely oblivious. From the beginning, you've gone about him all wrong. Let's discuss this outside. You left him with his delusions by making him think his sister's alive. Not here. No, enough of your silly games. Just tell him. Your sister is dead. Hit by a car just before you were born. - There. - Are you done? Are you happy? Are you? What did your experiment lead to? Finding out if he was responsible for his actions. Excuse me? I listened to him over several sessions to access his memories… - You're so full of shit. - I told you. When he woke up, he brought his sister back to life so he wouldn't have to face reality. Do you realize what you're saying? And what should I have done? Just reveal everything, watch him regress, and risk losing him again? He's a monster. He has a right to treatment. To be seen. To be heard. That is my job. Absolve him while you're at it. Get out. Please leave. Thomas, I am so sorry. I truly am sorry.
