Nine Days in Winter - Intensive care? - On your left. Aurélien! Why are you here? - Leave! - How are they? Dad was driving at 140 km/h. - You've seen someone? - More scandal? - You humiliated them enough! - Let go! Your book killed them. Bastard! Have you finished? Aren't you ashamed? Your brother had serious injuries. He died, as did his wife. I am deeply sorry. Based on Arnaud Cathrine's Je ne retrouve personne. Evening, Jean. - How are you? - Good. - Hi, Pascal. - Hi. So? - Tartare salad? - Perfect. Great. Six months later Good evening. I tried calling. - I know. - You never call back? What do you want? There's a leak at Saint-Lunaire. Is that why you came? The agent says it's urgent. The agent? I'm selling the house. You've not been in years. And me... Marion's always preferred Corsica. So... It had to end this way. It's on at 800,000. - 400 each. - No. Don't start. OK? The leak. We can't show the house as it is. - A plumber's coming tomorrow. - So? I'm busy. I'm operating. No change. I'm only here when... It pisses me off asking you. Well... I can't. I have a work meeting. - You can't change it? - No. How are you? OK. You? Not great. Thomas! - What? - We have to talk. Come to the office at 1. I can't. I've got a train in an hour. - What is it? - My novel... - What? - It's shit. Sorry? I re-read it. It's shit. Stop. Everyone's crazy about it. I have good feedback. It's like The Provincial Man. That's not easy. Your book is great. Listen up, Aurélien. You've done autobiographical fiction. You paid dearly for it. You had to change. A real event is good. - It's sordid. - A success. Thomas, this book isn't me. I'm not in it. I want to stop it. Let's not discuss this here. You're here tomorrow? My office at 4. OK? Day 1 For Sale I advise you not to buy. The cliff is collapsing. Don't you recognise me, Mado? Oh, it's you? You look bad, kid. Get in. Eat with me. - Is pasta with morels alright? - Great. Here. Open that for me. The corkscrew's in the 2nd drawer on the left. - You fired Sandrine? - No. She does the cleaning, I cook. It was disgusting. What are you doing? Getting glasses. Not there. The next one. Hey! Get moving! - Do you live here now? - Yes. I fly back to Paris sometimes. I'm still doing my stuff, roaming about. Beirut this year. Not worth it now. It's 2nd rate with the Wagner girls. What should I see? A sticker installation at the FIAC? No. It's all become so destitute, vulgar. So I stay here and re-read my classics. At least they are faithful. And I read you, of course. How's it going? You've done nothing for 2 years. I know. Time to be forgiven. Is that it? Shouldn't I have written it? Quite the opposite. To be honest, I found it delightful. Did you earn money? I get by. I don't need much. That's best. I saw your brother. He doesn't realise. Nor does the estate agent. We're this close to a landslide. I'm not sure you'll sell it. - Still, by the sea... - Exactly. It's all under threat. Hello. Hervé? Why are you here? I'm looking after the sale. Well... How long's it been? 15 years? Didn't you leave the area? Not really. I was in Rennes, then... well... Back to my roots. If I'd known... I expected your brother. - He packed the boxes? - Yes. Finish it. With the leak, it's average. I turned off the water. - Where is it from? - Below the attic. I'll show you. This place is such a pain! It's a bit out of the way, but I didn't think twice. - It's nice. - It's ideal for the kids. You still in Paris? Yes. What do you do? Well... I write. Really? Still? Good. What are you writing? Novels. You were in the paper. I should read your stuff. But with the kids, work, there's not much time. - How many do you have? - Two. Girls. - Your wife? - She works at the town hall. And you... Married? No. I'll get some matches. Where's the plumber? It's 3.20 pm. Call him. Henri Bonnot. - What's your code? - 0709. Listen, I've got a train at 5pm. Yes, but you should've called me. Come on... Yes. But 8 on the dot. I'm counting on you. Yes. See you tomorrow. Fucking plumber... There. You're selling? Looks like it, yes. Hello? Yes. You could let me know. How did it go? Great. He didn't come. Shit. What did you do? I'm on the train. I'm busy. What will we do? I don't know... - You're pissing me off. - Pissing you off? Anything sets you off. Don't panic, I'm still here. He's coming tomorrow. OK? Are you there? Yes. I'm still there. I heard. Do you want a medal? It's not easy being here, to tell the truth. What are you on about? Our parents or... your big low-tide break-up? Pack some boxes. There are papers I don't want left out. - OK. Bye. - Bye. "Big low-tide break-up?" The bastard! Nicole, Jean-Pierre, we had a drink for you. I hope the storms weren't too harsh. Aurélien sends his love. Emma. Hello? Emma? It's me. Aurélien? What is it? Nothing. I'd like to catch up. It's been ages. - Where are you? - Saint-Lunaire. Cyril decided to sell the house. What are you doing? Thinking of you, of us. Aurélien, I was going to tell you... I'm getting married in June. Great. Congratulations. Will you come? Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I? I've been wondering how to tell you all week. You've just done it. How long are you there for? I'm leaving tomorrow. I have to go. Sorry. Day 2 Mr Bonnot, I don't get it. It's 9 am. I can't wait any longer. The keys are at the agent's. I'm counting on you. Hello. The station. - I got oysters. - Good. Oh, the bastard... I didn't know he had all this. Wait. You're joking. We can't drink that. - Montrachet 1996. - Sure? It's ours. Oh, yes. Help me. When I think... All those dinners were merry. Yes, when you came. You created havoc. Otherwise, I can tell you... Still on that? Writing's not enough? 3 books telling all about your family. Enough! Let them rest in peace. Still, your books are good. - Do you know why? - No. Because they're cruel. - You taught me. - I'm proud of it. I never told you, but I'm flattered to be in your books. It's a pity you changed the names. Not everyone recognised me. Incredible. What? All the same, I can understand your mother. She'd have preferred you to miss me out. You were merciless then. I hope you're not becoming apathetic. Why did you come back? No, we'll go to the fort. Like when you were little. Even if we'll always agree... I was wrong, I came back To this long-lost town Where I spent my childhood I was wrong, I wanted again to see the hill where shadows shine at night. Hello. This is Emma Brunet. Leave a message. Thank you. Bye. I wanted to hear your voice. I'm still in Saint-Lunaire. It's hard. I don't want you to marry. I want to see you. Day 3 - What a look. - Come in. It's cold. It's been a while. What is it? I wanted to go for a coffee. Well, with pleasure. Wait 2 minutes. I'm coming. - No news from the plumber? - No. Are you staying a bit? - Aurélien! - How are you? - What a surprise! - Good to see you. You too. I'm so proud when I see you in the papers! See, she follows me. I could have been your wife. - Stop it, we were 16. - So? - We'd have divorced. - Maintenance. But you'd pay. Not like the other bastard. Liqueur coffees? No, I'm working. Plain coffee. So, you're selling. Yeah. We hadn't seen you much. You got smashed with Mado? Can't hide anything. She's incredible. I don't know how she does it. Excuse me. - I'll be back. - OK. Emma? Are you OK? Yes. You called me. I called? What did I say? Wait, another call. Alright. Something's come up. Let's say 7pm? - OK. See you later. - Yes. - I have to go. - Anything bad? I have a meeting in New York. My sister can't take Michelle. I'll let you go. - Wait. - What? I'll take her. Seriously? The sea isn't bad for a 4-year old. 5. Michelle's 5. Already? Can you be alone with her? - Well... - No, bad idea. Why? Afraid of his reaction? It's not the time. You're not her father. Come and stay 24 hours, so she gets used to it. Maybe. I'll pick you up from the train. One leaves Montparnasse at 8.44am. I'll call you tonight. I'm at your service, Mr Curiol. It depends on you. From tomorrow... Wait, one of the owners is here. Mr Delamare. 3pm tomorrow? No, no, I can't. No! Mr Curiol, I'll call tomorrow. Times are a problem. Yes, we'll arrange a visit. Don't worry. Alright. Good evening. Same to you. Good bye. What? He has money, he's in a hurry. A great chance. Yeah, tomorrow doesn't suit me. You're complicated. There. Not bad. We'll get a swimming pool in next year. - Fréderique. - A pleasure. Aurélien. How are you? Thank you. It's not like my parents'. I don't remember it. You never wanted to come. Not true. It's not a reproach. Oh! My little angels. Say hello, girls. Hello. This is Manon, and Lola. - Hello. - This is Aurélien. Now off to bed. Our story? Go on up, I'll come and read. - They're good. - They're cute, yes. Their father's sweetness. And! Careful. Help yourself. Go on. Here. Thanks. Well... To selling. To your family. A little story and I'm back. You should leave him alone. Sorry? No, thanks. Your wine is wonderful. It was my father's. His legacy. Will you two buy something nearby? - Who? - You and your brother. I wouldn't share anything with him. That's sad. I don't think so. Anyway, family... Well? It's stifling. You mean couples? No. How I grew up, my parents' conformity, good small-town pharmacists. Does your kind look down on their family? What for? To feel like you're above others? What kind? No one asked you to marry your parents. A couple is created. You need imagination. - Been married long? - 1 year after Lola. - He was like you. - Meaning...? Yeah, how was I? You know. Scared of commitment. Finding someone is easy. Knowing what you want... No? Am I wrong? I'm just saying. You're the writer. You know best. Had enough? I'll get the next course. No. Stay with your friend. Sorry. I don't know what's up. - She's usually quiet. - She loves me. - I need to answer. - Go on. Someone's coming tomorrow. Oh, alright. That's why no visit. You just have to say. Who is it? Emma. A girl I loved. We were together... She's engaged. And...? Well... It's complicated. Always is with you. Day 4 The same Emma? The one you came here with? Yes. Re-igniting the fire? That never works. Nice, Mado. Encouraging. Careful, the brakes are gone. I'm sorry. Problem with the car. I need to wash my hands. - Hello, Michelle. - Hello. I reserved a table. We ate on the train. I leave at 2pm. I thought you'd stay a day. I can't. - Here. - Thanks. - Thank you. - Goodbye. - I could have paid. - It's fine. Would you like sole? I still can't cook. You're joking! It's simple. Two soles. Some flour, each side... Are you sulking? Yes, I think I am. I'm flying tonight. You could have stayed an evening. - If only for her. - Stop. How much? What is it? When's the wedding? Not that. Sole recipes, yes, the wedding, no. How long have you been together? Are you sure? Good, you've moved on. Yes, I have. I thought I'd have a chance. What do you mean? It's been 6 years. Remind me why I left you. I never thought I was exemplary. Give me a second chance... Monday, we'll get a flat, Tuesday, a baby? Is that it? Stop it. That's horrible. Because I love you? I don't like how you love me. It's over. I can't be angry. I'm sorry for you. I find someone who's what you're not, and love returns. Aurélien? You're in a story. Just write. You do that best. Should I leave with Michelle? Give me your hand. Théo. Horses on the beach. Be good, boys. - Hello. Isa? - Hello. I'm here, sweetie! They've talked about the cliff for 50 years. We know about false alarms around here. Mr Guedj, just a moment. I went to the meeting. The geological report says there's no risk. - Can I trust you? - Yes. Shall we see the cellar first? - No, the structure. - OK. Follow me. Come in, Michelle. Can you wait on the 2nd floor? I'm coming. - What's this? - I didn't expect you. I can see that. I'll introduce you. No, it's OK. Make an effort. Hervé... Er... This is Mr Delamare. The owner. - Hello. - Hello. Excuse us. - Excuse me, about the noise... - The noise? Doesn't the sea get annoying? I think she needs the toilet. - Do you need the toilet? - No. Come on, I'll show you it. So you know. I left them a moment. Are you OK? - Where's Emma? - She's not here. - Be nice. - What do you mean? You know what I mean. Answer their questions. It's not a good day. Yes, yes. Wait a second. Do you like the circus? I don't like it. It's too scary. Listen, I'll call you back. Thank you. - Do you want a nap? - Yes. OK. I never liked the circus either. Only I didn't dare say. What about ponies? - No noise, she's napping. - Emma? No, her daughter. Don't wake her. Isn't she cute? Coffee? You let her leave without a fight? What could I do? Lock her up? Does her father agree? There's no father. She got inseminated in Copenhagen. You're kidding? She's quite good for... - For what? - You know what I mean. Not being conceived... - Normally? - Yes. There must be surprises. You're getting involved... You're your father's son. You fought it, but you're very like him! Wrong target. The father's son is Cyril. That's what you always said. Cyril's done something with his life. What are you doing? Look at me. I know. You're like your father. I've nothing to learn about that. Oh, yes you have! Let me... Mado? Are you OK? Stop looking at me. Get me a glass of water. What you wrote about me and your father... Your mother's silences, respecting decorum, fearing scandal... What's that called? You don't get it? Cowardice. What else did you do with Emma? Your father couldn't jump into things. Exactly like you. You know, Aurélien, people can't spend their lives waiting for you. The Delamares have no balls. It doesn't look good. I'm sorry. It didn't really work. It doesn't matter. You're cute, Michelle. - Shall I help you? - No. Oh, I forgot the rice. Yes, hello? Yes, I'll get him. Michelle... Hello? Bad timing? We're eating. At 7 pm? Who's the girl? What do you want? What's it to be? I won't change my mind. You think something's decided? I won't let you publish the book. Got it? Aurélien, you know this is serious? No, I don't think so. What's up? I don't know you. You're pissing me off, that's what's up! You know me now? Fucking hell! Sorry, Michelle, I shouldn't have yelled. The man annoyed me. I want to see Mum. Your mum's on the plane. We can't call just now. I want to go on the plane too. What are you doing? - I don't want to sleep there. - Oh? - Where do you want to sleep? - There. That's difficult, Michelle. That's my parents' room. Where are your parents? They're not here. They're dead? Day 5 - Hello! - Hello. Your daughter? Goddaughter. Michelle. - Hello, pumpkin. - Hello. This is Virginie. - What'll it be? - Hot chocolate. And for you? A double espresso, please. You have things for her to do? She's not excited by ponies. Why not the holiday club? It's by the school. They do lots: drawing, music, dance... Do you want to? - Yes. - Yes. Well, then. Come on. Hi, Michelle. How are you? See you later. When I met you, I hated you. I did more. I know we pissed you off. "Rich kid". I got that so much! You were up there. Your little coat, perfect trousers... I know. I was a caricature. No, not just that. You were handsome. Wait... Excuse me. Hervé? Hervé, wait. Hey! We'll just talk about the sale. I have an offer. The Curiols. 100% cash. We can sign tomorrow. OK. The others? The best offer is the old guys. I don't like them. Hello, sweetie, are you OK? Yes. - Having fun? - Yes. - Is Aurélien nice? - Yes. What did you do today? I made a mask. A mask? What of? A witch. What colour is your mask? Green, blue and yellow. Wow! Can you Aurélien on? Yes. Bye. Bye. Hello? - Is everything OK? - Yeah, yeah. - Is she good? - Adorable. Everyone says she looks a lot like me. Aurélien, please... - Not laughing? - No. I think it's funny. Well, this must be costing you. Bye. Yes, what is it? Come for a drink? Where? No choice, I have the girl. OK. Why invite me? I want to understand. About time. Meaning what? You never think of others. Could I write if I didn't? You write about you. What do you know? You've read them? Of course I have. I believed you. The last one too? The Provincial Man? Yes. I wondered how you'd talk about us. So, you set us up to be friends? - What are you saying? - Yes. You bought lower-class boys so as not to be bothered. - I was your bodyguard. - Stop it, Hervé. I was naive. I thought you liked me. Shit, that wasn't all. Yeah, no. Sorry. I forgot all you wrote about your family. And mine too. My father drunk, my brothers beating me up... There's something I don't get. Why not say everything? Huh? That I was crazy for you, that it almost did me in? Why's that not in your book? Huh? The poofter prole crazy for a rich boy! I thought you were daring, not a care for convention, but... you're scared. I didn't know. You're joking? Shit! I really didn't know! Maybe I knew deep down. I'm going to piss. I'm drunk. No noise. Michelle's sleeping. Help me. Fucking help me. I'm sorry. You're my friend. Day 6 - What's the seaweed? - It's my broomstick. Really? What's it for? - Flying. - Flying? Don't fly off alone. No. Tell me, OK? Or I'll worry. Yes. I'll run your bath. I don't believe it! Mr Bonnot, will it take much longer? A while yet. Mado, it's us. Can I give her a bath? We've got no water. Mado? Are you dead? Michelle, where are you? Michelle? Mado? Come here. Go outside. Wait there. Mado, what happened? Mado, can you hear me? Mado? Stop jabbering and help me. Their bloody treatment... You can't... imagine the side-effects. So I stopped it. It will be quicker, but at least I'll know myself. - Are you sure? - Yes. I know what I'm doing. I can't bear them and their protocol. They always have something new to suggest. But I'm not theirs. All that's over. - Aurélien? - Yes? I'm hungry. That's a spider crab. That's a crab, and I don't know what that one is. That's a lobster. Don't move, I'll order. - Hello. - Hello. 2 dozen oysters. I'll get that now. Do you have shallot sauce? Yes, in the deli section. A pot of shallot vinaigrette. Thank you. Have you seen a girl? She was here. - No. Sorry. - Michelle! Have you seen a girl, 5? No, I've not seen her. Michelle! Have you seen a 5-year old girl? Michelle! I wanted to avoid it. Don't you see? You're crazy! I almost ran you over! Where's your mum? Where were you? Don't go off like that! You scared me. It's fine. It's fine. Calm down. Thank you. Thank you. - You scared me, Michelle. - It's fine now. What's your name? Irène. Thank you, Irène. - Thank you. - You're welcome. That's Easter Island. The most isolated island in the world. It's thousands of kilometres off the Chilean coast, and thousands of kilometres from Tahiti. I was your age when my parents said we were going to the island to see the statues. I didn't want to go. They're like huge dolls. See? Look. How big are they? Well, much bigger than this house. I only saw them from afar. - They scared me. - They don't scare me. Really? They still do me a bit. But in 10 days I'll finally see them close up. Day 7 Aurèle... Come on, get up. What are you doing? Did you break the cellar door? What time is it? We're signing with the Curiols. - No, not them. - Stop it. They have money. - Quiet. A child's sleeping. - What child? Emma's daughter, Michelle. Emma's here? You're together? No. - Why's she here? - You don't need to know. I'm taking a shower. Well done. You woke her. Hello, miss. Who are you? I'm his brother. - You have a brother? - Seems so. What's your name? Cyril. And you? Michelle. Another signature. The buyers renounce suspensive clauses since they... - Excuse me. It's OK. I'll go. We're going, Michelle. - Bye. - Come on. What is it? - It's too fast. - You're a pain. Give me time. For what? You can't make a decision anyway. Come on, Michelle. Signatures are always a difficult time. There is a lot to do, so... It's OK. They'll wait a few days. The guy immediately classed you a "chronic indecisive". You can treat it. When do you leave? Must you be so unpleasant? I just got here. And it's still my home too. Can you get water for the moats? When's the book out? You're interested in my books now? Oh, sorry. I forgot I'm not qualified enough to talk literature. It won't be out. Shit. Not "shit". I stopped it. Don't look at me like that. Get water. Are you coming? Do you have a child? Yes, I have a boy called Gabriel. - He's 10. - Where is he? With his mum. Where's his mum? Let's race! Come on! So, because the pencil loves the eraser, he writes love letters. The eraser loves the pencil. The only problem is she erases all she sees. So she forgets what the pencil said. The eraser's silly. No, she's not. She has no choice. She's made to erase. Until a pen comes along. When he comes, he sees the eraser, and falls in love. The eraser likes him a lot. She doesn't forget what he wrote. She can't erase ink. I don't like the pen. Me neither. Good night. - Finished? - Almost. I'm not sure. "Fish, fish..." Are there any photos of you smiling? I remember the day it was taken. Yeah? You remember that? You're joking? It was a betrayal. You abandoned me, I was alone. - With our parents. - Exactly. Uni was in Rouen. What could I do? - It's your fault. - Sorry? You were on their side. I had no chance. You weren't interested in me. You sent me packing. You can't take criticism. - You're harsh. - I defend myself. I didn't love them any less. Just not the same. - I disappoint you. - Stop. You're proud of your life, and I'm lost. What do you know about my life? Other than the ideas you have. What am I to you? A little bourgeois, stuck in normality? Arrogant, authoritarian? Look at yourself. Have you seen yourself? Who are you to judge me? You didn't dare make Michelle. How can you say that? I shouldn't have come. Don't sneak off! Not now! - It's horrible what you said! - Let go! - Let go. - You first. OK. On three. One, two... three. Marion left. What? She left me. That can't be true. What happened? I don't know. I didn't see it. Have you spoken? - It wasn't love. - It was. No. No. That's true. I was stupid. She'll be back. No, it's over. What are you doing? Are you crying? No. Day 8 One, two, three! Oh, shit. We'll do it. There's no wind. Come on, let's go. Concentrate. We'll do it. Take the handles because Cyril can't. - Careful. - Pull the strings. Ready? Ready for take-off? One... - Two... - Michelle! Mum! - I missed you! - Me too. Hello. Both brothers, what luxury. We're not great at kite-flying, but... I should have called, it's last-moment. We're going to Simon's mother's. You got back when? Last night. Did it go OK? I think so. You should ask her. - Will you come see me? - Yes. You're not selling? I meant in general. Let's get your stuff. I'll say hi. Château Canet-Rodier Saint-Julien Day 9 Miracles don't happen. I won't argue, but you're making a mistake. I can get you an appointment. - I don't want that. - You don't? I'm not offering gym membership. Well... Otherwise, how are you? Bad. - The hospital? - Marion. She left? 2 months ago, with Gabriel. It was coming. At your wedding, you were beautiful, intelligent, ambitious. The perfect couple. You were terrifying. Shared desires, goals to reach. Everything in common. But was there love? Love didn't interest you. Perhaps. But it does now. It's not bad that it lasted 15 years. Food's ready! What are you doing? We're coming. We have to sign. I know. We'll talk, but we have to sign. Take care. Last Sorrow Family Meals The Provincial Man For Mum and Dad Obviously subjective fragments of my hostility - Mado? - Come here now. Come here! How are you? I think it's the end. - I'll call for help. - No! I want you to stay. Thank you. Aurélien. Sold Sweet Home - Hello. - How are you? - Can you set another place? - Alright. Subtitles: Eclair Media
