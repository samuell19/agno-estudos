Agreed, you can put it in it's place now Gentlemen, if you please Santo vs Dr. Death How is it possible? What could have happened? You saw the perfect condition the painting was in before it was shipped here - Naturally - of course, it must have happened while it was being shipped Inspector, what do you think? I can only assure you That between now and the moment the painting was handed over in Mexico no one has had access to it We followed the shipping van the whole way, we didn't lose sight of it, even for a second This isn't a random accident, it has to have been caused by a madman Gentlemen, I think we shouldn't waste any time Of course Inspector, you have total liberty to proceed in any manner you find most convenient I'd appreciate it if all of you can keep quiet about this We should speak with the director of the Mexican National Art Gallery - as soon as possible - Very well What do you want? If you're with the press then wait out there, we'll let you know when we're ready - And if I'm not? - Same thing applies, Santo's busy Tell Santo I bring news from a friend Rudy, let that man in and watch the door from the outside so we aren't bothered Interpol, you've been assigned to a mission I have contracts to fulfil, I'm going to Spain for a world title match in Madrid That's one of the reasons you were chosen, because you'll be working there That way your presence in that country would have a good excuse What's this about? The Velasquez painting that came from Prague and was displayed in our country has suffered great damage Here? That's one of the things you have to find out, we don't know anything else I have to be in Madrid in a few days, it'd be good to start investigating here first There are many people working on the case in Mexico You must travel to Spain as soon as possible, it's urgent I'm sorry friend Yes, Santo the Man in the Silver Mask Let him leave Mexico, we'll take care of him here Follow him and watch everything he does Understood It's the work of a madman Do you think it can be restored? Yes, fortunately the acid or product they used didn't penetrate deeply into the canvas To be exact it's acid, formic acid along with something else that we haven't been able to identify Here's a copy of the report from the chemical science faculty Do they say that it won't keep spreading? Yes, in that very paper, it reflects the chemist's opinions Keep us informed of anything that happens Of course, being the custodian of that painting is a great responsibility and honour If you consider police surveillance necessary... This castle is well guarded - Goodbye - Goodbye I'm convinced that in your hands the painting will be saved Thank you Have a good trip gentlemen We're alone Peter I congratulate you Peter, your work has been admirable Thank you Doctor Be sure to prepare everything for tonight, I'm going to make a copy of the painting But first it has to be cleaned No, I'll make a copy of the painting in it's current state with which I'll pretend to work That jewel mustn?t be damaged - I don't understand - Like in Paris It's been a long while I get it You must make sure nothing goes wrong Peter Hello? Excuse me? Come upstairs, the Doctor is waiting for you Come on Felix, we have a party Nancy, you'll be next but you'll have to wait a few months Let's go She's dead Scalpel You can come in Come on, hurry That's good That's what I think gentlemen I don't see anything that makes me think it's a fake What is it that makes you say this is a copy? The quality of Velasquez's painting in general is absolute, however, in that section it's missing a master's touch Yes, possibly, but I'd chalk it up to the accident the painting has suffered Supposing that it were a copy, it would have been made in Velasquez's time And in his own studio We'll run an analysis on the canvas An analysis would only tell us the age of the cloth and on that point we all agree Once it's been restored we should put the piece under an x-ray machine That would be the definitive test - Excuse me Doctor - Sarah, what's going on? An urgent call from London Gentlemen, please excuse me a few seconds Of course Doctor, it's Max. I'm in London Santo has been investigating in the National Gallery He's reserved a ticket for Paris, - I suppose he'll go to the Louvre - To the Louvre? Max, it's necessary that that man never arrives in Paris - He won't - I hope so It's of vital importance to me You know I pay well for services rendered, and I consider this one extraordinary, so good luck and contact me tomorrow after the job Very well, I will In the archives I read about an incident that happened a few years ago We had a very similar case a few years ago. Damage appeared on a painting inexplicably Fortunately it turned out to be a copy, I say fortunately in hopes that one day the original will turn up Do you have photographs of the damage the painting suffered? Of course Who discovered it was a forgery? The restorer. A few hours after getting the painting he called to tell us his suspicions Who was the restorer? Professor Schwartz, a German who had prodigious talent for this work Had? Yes, he died a few days after returning the painting The press reported that an airplane he travelled in with a friend crashed Very interesting, these will be very useful to me - I'll accompany you - Thank you Idiot, letting himself be surprised by that masked man We don't know what happened Doctor We know that Max allowed Santo to visit the Louvre It's been 13 years Robert, you shouldn't worry before there's need I've made the error of mentioning the painting being a fake, in Paris they'll tell him that the same thing has happened before Doctor, no one can connect Professor Schwartz with you, this will all seem like a coincidence Yes, but a very odd one We have to eliminate Santo Agreed. I'll be in Madrid tomorrow to greet him No You can't leave the castle until everything settles down They could have given Santo a picture of Schwartz, he might recognize you If in 13 years of faking my death we still haven't allayed suspicions... In a normal situation yes, but this isn't And besides, remember that you replaced Professor Schwartz due to your likeness The most sensible thing is that no one should see you I think the Doctor is right, it's not necessary We have people in Madrid who will make sure Santo will not be a problem Yes Get in contact with Morris, there you have all the information on his arrival Yes yes, just a moment Gentlemen, I beg you, just a moment please, I have to make a call I have news from a friend that lives a few kilometres away Agreed, when and where? At nine in Sumos Aguas, room three Please tell us Santo, how long do you plan to stay in Spain? That depends how the three matches we have scheduled go And who will you be fighting? Has he ever let anyone remove his mask? - No, never! - Want to try? So long Come in, the door is open Come in, sit Would you like something to drink? Yes, a whiskey please Surprised, aren't you? Yes, a bit. I expected someone different I'm sorry to have disappointed you No, it's not that, I just expected a man with more experience for this job And what makes you think I don't have it? To be frank, your age It's natural, but in jail the minutes are hours, and I've spent years locked up which means thousands of hours of experience But we'll get to know each other soon My name is Paul I'm delighted to work with you Paul A toast to everything turning out well Have you been told what this is about? I've been told everything, I'm just waiting for your orders Tomorrow we'll go to the Museum of Prague- Looks like you were right Paul, we're getting to know each other How did you transport it from the airport to here? In a well guarded armoured car and they didn't stop from Barajas until getting to the museum Then we should discard the possibility that someone entered the car on the way Exactly Specialized workers opened the box in our presence and the painting was damaged Identical security measures were taken in Mexico The box in which the painting was shipped has been examined thoroughly and we haven't found a single clue Who is the restorer? The most prestigious one at the moment, Doctor Mann Doctor? Of what? Well... art, and I don't know what other branch of science You've been very helpful, thank you You're welcome. You know I'm at your service Is Dr. Mann Spanish? No, he's naturalized. He originally came from central Europe and is especially meticulous A few days ago he told me he suspects that the painting isn't an original And what are the experts' opinions? The suspicions have yet to be confirmed, in the end it'll have to be examined via x-ray What do you think? I think it's necessary to go back to the Louvre as soon as possible Why? There was a similar case there and I want all the details It was packed carefully and sent to Moscow but on being sent back here and unpacked we noticed it was seriously damaged Was it due to acid and another unknown substance, do you remember? Exactly. After much investigating we learned the damage occurred on the trip, they used an injecting mechanism to go through the box it was packed in Was the perpetrator caught? Well, one of the guards was suspected, but nothing could be proved against him A bit later he committed suicide, or at least just turned up dead Did the Professor restore the painting in the museum? No, in his studio Professor Schwartz rented out an old studio for that purpose in Montmartre What did he look like? Rather athletic, young, though his hair was white, and about 190 cm tall A cigarette? And about the painting being a forgery, could you give us some other detail? I think you know most of it, all I know is that it was a forgery, as the x-rays demonstrated but it's such an exact copy that even so there were doubts The only difference from the original Rembrandt is that the paint is very faint, as if the brush strokes were more tenuous, less consistent It's was made at the same time as the original, however Very interesting. is there any way to get a picture of that professor? Of course there is World Championship! Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask vs Braulio Veliz Attention! A Middleweight World Championship match! Two out of three falls with no time limit The challenger, Braulio Veliz of Spain, weight in at 87 kg The world champion, Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask, of Mexico, weighing in at 85 kg Take it away Mr. Referee! Champion of the world, Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask! Congratulations champ, you're not bad at all Hurry up, we have to go celebrate this victory I'm sorry to contradict you, but tonight we're going to sleep You're in charge, but I'd like to know why Early tomorrow we'll be paying Dr. Mann a visit What do you expect him to say? Enough to learn if the hand that damaged the Rembrandt is the same one that damaged Velasquez's painting The Drunks Even if it was, what would that prove? That we're not dealing with a madman, rather with someone very clever I have to admit I don't understand Paul, don't you find it strange that a madman who destroys a work of art waits 13 whole years before striking again? Well, you're right, but there's no difference between finding a clever man and a crazy one Though it may seem the same to you, it isn't And that's all the information Remember that it has to look like a simple accident, over Agreed, it will be as you say. Out So if our dear Dr. Mann turns out to be Professor Schwartz we'll have reached the end Aren't you going to go back? I think it was just an accident I don't think so You think they were trying to kill us? - At very least, they tried - They didn't Paul Well then it must have been an Asian driving So you're Interpol agents Take a seat gentlemen, I'll be with you shortly This way Sit, please - Can I offer you anything? - No thanks Thank you Sarah Alright, I'm at your service It's always a pleasure to collaborate with the police - Did you know Professor Schwartz? - Yes, although rivals, we were colleagues and excellent friends He disappeared 12 years ago without a trace No I read in the newspapers that he'd been in an airplane accident - Oh, I'm sorry, I haven't offered you- - No thanks - Is this him? - Yes, but I don't see what the point of this is, I thought you were here to ask about The Drunks You see Doctor, the reason for our visit- Excuse me. Doctor, I was told you wanted me to pose Yes, before these men came, they're agents from Interpol Esther is one of my models - Enchanted - It's a pleasure Esther, show the men around the castle because I suppose that's another reason for their visit, - am I wrong? - No, not at all. We want to make sure the painting is in no danger I've already told the director of the museum that this castle is nearly impenetrable Being nearly impenetrable leaves some chance Perhaps Paul, go see if you can find one Excuse me When you're ready You'll have to wait a minute while I change With pleasure If you don't laugh at me - I'll tell you something - I promise I'm afraid, the people here are great but I'm afraid of finishing my work and having to leave Why? It might be a coincidence, but whenever a model has finished her work and left we never hear from her again Miriam left two months ago, she swore she would write but I never received a letter - Did you know her from before? - No It could be that on leaving here she forgot her good intentions What worries me is the thing with Maggie Maggie and I are close friends, she has a good luck charm, a little stuffed bear, and she would never get rid of it When she came to say goodbye to me she forgot it in my room and she hasn't come back for it, she hasn't even written for it Perhaps she found another good luck charm Another time she had forgot it she came back for it, losing an important contract to do it And haven't you tried to get in touch with her? Yes, I've written. I never got an answer Are you forbidden to make phone calls? No Honestly, I see nothing strange in what you're telling me. They could just be coincidences In any case, when you're about to leave, call me at this number - Is that Peter? - Who? I thought it was Peter, the Doctor's nephew, but it's not him Does that nephew live here? Yes. He's been blind for many years, or perhaps from birth, I don't know We see very little of him, and not every day Blind, what bad luck Talking to you has put my mind at ease, especially now that Margaret to picking me up soon I wouldn't want to involve her in a mess When is she arriving? She'll get to Madrid the day after tomorrow She's taking a flight from London And this is the last thing on our tour, the pool Sabin, Vicky, come here Vicky, this is Paul - Enchanted - Enchanted I see Dr. Mann makes sure his models enjoy themselves to the fullest Yes, it's really a lovely place and he's a delightful man Another companion. Sabin, Paul - It's a pleasure - Delighted You're not telling me Paul is staying here, are you? No, though not because I don't want to He's working, he's an Interpol agent That's a shame I can only assure you that for being the supposed perpetrator of the damage to the painting in the Louvre and The Drunk he's used very different methods Thank you Doctor... Doctor of what? Art and chemical science Two opposing arts My father wanted me to be a chemist, but painting was always my calling And what's Margaret's last name? Smith, Margaret Smith, why? No reason, just curiosity You've been a very useful tour guide And remember, if you need anything from me just call I will, now I feel much calmer - What do you think? - About what? Of our visit That we'll have to start all over Yes, you're right They've just left The Doctor doesn't want them to notice anything, simply let us know when they go by on their way to Madrid Repeat the change I repeat, we will only give word when the car goes by on the way to Madrid Over and out It's time, my dear Sarah, to look upon my collection, the world's most incredible collection in the world Some of them have cost so much sweat and blood And how much ingenuity While they exhibit copies in the best museums of the world, I possess the originals Now I only need the Beautiful Gardener I'm excited at the thought that these very canvases have felt the touch of the glorious masters Rembrandt da Vinci Goya Velasquez and El Greco What did you want? The policemen passed the checkpoint on the road - but if you allow me- - I know what you're going to say Have you ever seen me make a decision without considering it? Never If you want to know my reasoning I'll tell you I didn't want them to have a second accident on the same road because it might make them suspicious I'm confident that Santo will die in the ring. Let's wait for that match in Madrid But we don't know what Esther talked about to the policeman on the grounds In the conversation you recorded when they returned it was clear it wasn't important He said "If your fears continue, call me" But what are her fears? What could she have told him? We didn't hear that Nothing important, if it was they would have said goodbye differently In any case, once Margaret arrives I'll say goodbye to Esther and then you'll be the ones in charge of her - Ms. Margaret Smith? - Yes? Interpol My papers are in order and I'm not carrying contraband No, I'm not here for that, I was just hoping you could work with us I'm sorry, I have something else I need to do That's exactly what this is about. If you'll be kind enough to come with me I'll explain Alright You cooperation would consist of letting an Interpol agent take your place and pretend to be Margaret Smith around Dr. Mann You'll receive your usual pay and the cost of your hotel I'd be crazy not to accept You mustn't get in contact with Esther as that would endanger your life and the agent's You can count on my cooperation There's something you haven't told me Who gave you my name? No one, Paul and I picked you after meeting Margaret using Interpol's archives That's why I asked. I'll have to talk to the Chief, I have a job to complete We already talked to him, you've been relieved of it Perfect. So you think Dr. Mann has something to do with this? I don't think that man is suspicious at all Neither do I Esther's fears seem to me to be the fruit of an overactive imagination Then why put me there? I'm convinced that what happened wasn't the work of a madman, so while we still don't have any solid leads we have to be as close as possible to the painting without arousing suspicion and you are the perfect person When should I leave? After speaking with Margaret, she'll fill you in on her relationship with Esther I think that's a good idea. Paul, accompany her, I'm expecting a call from Mexico Please Ms. Esther, don't move Forgive me Doctor, I'm very tired I know, but Sabin and Vicky must be too and they're not moving Excuse me Be patient I think in two or three days I'll be done with this Doctor, the new model has just arrived Tell her to come in Please Good evening Hello Esther! Paul sent me in Margaret's place That's a cold greeting for your friend Margaret The Doctor doesn't like us to move when we're working - No no, you can rest - Dr. Mann - It's a pleasure Doctor - Enchanted Your companions will fill you in on my habits and will tell you what you have to do Sarah, take her to her room I'll see you later Esther Sabin, Vicky, delighted Ladies, let's keep working. Pose please This is your bedroom It's precious Lunch is at two and dinner is at nine What time does the Doctor work? He has no set hour, just when the inspiration strikes, sometimes even early in the morning - And my obligations? - Punctuality, both to meals and when asked to go pose I'll be punctual - Esther? - Yes Come in We haven't seen each other in four months but you haven't changed a bit Perhaps a little heavier, we get to eat well and don't work much I want to thank you for recommending me for this job, you live like queens here. What's the old man like? A good guy, he doesn't call much but he's sort of grouchy Today he told me that I'll have to leave in three days What he hates most is when you move while posing I want you to show me this castle, I'll be dressed in a moment To be honest, I didn't understand at first, I don't know if they noticed Good thing you were supposed to be posing at the time Tell me more about Mann and the rest The truth is I haven't noticed anything strange, I wouldn't be surprised if the secretary was involved with with the Doctor but it really doesn?t' show, and we only see the old man at meals, and not always Alright, do you know the castle well? Yes, well, I think I do Are there any forbidden areas? No, just the Doctor's room, if that's what you mean You've disappointed me, it all seems so normal In any case, don't forget the microphones If you have anything to say to me, write it - I love Spain - You like the sun? I dislike rain Me too, and in spite of the climate I've always liked England Thank you. And you Peter? I haven't been back since my accident I thought you were blind from birth No, I lost my sight in a car accident 13 years ago By the way Margaret, what train brought you from Madrid? I didn't take a train, I drove my car Stupendous, that way when the Doctor doesn't need us we can go to town And what? Look at the hicks? No, to go to the discoth?que If the Doctor permits it we can Of course, of course you can Do you play bris? Badly, but I play Excellent, one evening we'll invite Dr. Hidalgo and along with Sarah we'll play a hand You've just won the Doctor's friendship Yes, I like bris Alright, goodnight ladies Want me to help you? I'm no cripple, I can fend for myself Forgive me - That Peter isn't too friendly - He has his moments And now what can we do? Is there a television? The Doctor doesn't like it, he says he hates seeing commercials for detergents The best thing to do is lie down and read, I'm becoming quite a scholar If you want I can lend you some magazines, I have many No, I think I'll sleep What are you doing here Miss? Forgive me, I couldn't sleep and came looking for a book All of those are scientific texts Are you a chemist? Yes, are you interested in chemistry? No, not at all I'm sorry Thank you very much Doctor. Excuse me Rest well - Come in Peter - Thank you - Goodnight - Goodnight What was she doing? She was looking for a book, at least that's what she said Why weren't the alarm systems on? It was a mistake on my part - Don't let it happen again - Yes - Is there news from Madrid? - No, not yet It'll be soon Attention! Sensational combat of two falls with no time limit Mask against mask! The Northern Puma! Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask! Attention, winner by three count, Santo, the Man in the Silver Mask! X1 calling FL, over FL here, go on, over X1 one reporting, was received well, I searched the castle well I found nothing strange except for a laboratory and there are microphones in the rooms. We can go wherever we please There are no forbidden areas, over What chemicals are there in the laboratory, over I don't know, over Did you see the nephew? Does he look like the man in Schwartz's picture, over There's a strong resemblance but he's blind, over Make sure he's not pretending, over I'll make sure. I'll call at this hour tomorrow, over If there's an emergency call at any time. One of us will be here at all times Will you forgive my ill humour last night? It bothers me when people consider me a cripple On one condition What is it? Tell me about your accident It was very simple. I drove a car, I drove well and liked to go fast Now I've lost the pleasure of velocity On taking a sharp turn I crashed into a car straight on Because of the impact I lost my sight Miss, get me away from the branches, remember that I can't see I beg you to forgive me, I was distracted, are you hurt? No, don't worry Sit down please Now I have to ask forgiveness for not knowing how to deal with someone who's blind I know it's difficult, sometimes it makes people uncomfortable What do you miss most? Not being able to move freely Right now I'd like to walk looking at the sky, to see the colours, After not seeing them for so long you start forgetting If you don't mind I'd rather walk I like walking I think she's making sure I'm blind - In what way? - Very ably Walking through the park there was a branch level to my face, she didn't warn me I pretended not to see and ran into it She also didn't tell me Esther was there when we bumped into her But later I had to make a superhuman effort not to react when she reflected sunlight into my eyes with a little mirror Intentionally? She pretended to fix her makeup We'll have to make sure Send them to me to pose While they do so, search among her personal effects Alright I'm dying of curiosity, can you tell me why you made me perfume myself near Peter? To make sure if he's blind or not And he is? No If he was the smell of your perfume would have alerted him to your presence Blind people develop a strong sense of smell The only bad thing is that he might have realized it Nothing Just like in Esther's room. Couldn't it just be your imagination Peter? I'm sure she was trying to find out if I'm really blind We haven't checked the car A portable transmitter Let the doctor know Excuse me, Peter wants to talk to you, it's urgent You can rest ladies - Let's go! - What's going on? I don't like this, it's possible they've discovered the transmitter And what happens if they have? Let's go, it's best that they not find us How are we going to leave like this? It's better than losing our lives here. Follow me Where? Hurry There's an exit here? There's one here that they might not know I know about - Follow me - I'm scared Please I imagine that now there's no doubt No.. Take care of them - Look! - It's gas! Yes? Alright, we'll be right up You Now you'll tell me who you are and what you're looking for That's silly, you already know I know what you've told us, but not the truth which is what you're going to tell us now Leave me alone! Look at these. They're of the most poisonous sort If you refuse to talk you'll find out for yourself What do you want to know, I've told you the truth! I'm Margaret Smith, I came to pose for the doctor! Yes, I know that, but what were you and your friend doing in the castle's halls? Last night I went down for a book I discovered a door in the library We were curious to see what was behind it, that's all No, by god, I swear, I'm telling the truth! And the transmitter in your car? Can you explain that? It's a transmitter radio, I always travel with it I've been an enthusiast for years I've told you the truth! All of his victims are the ones that have no family or people that'll miss them I don't understand why they're doing this He has a formula with which he makes perfect copies of the paintings they bring him to restore and as you can see, he needs women For what? They inject us every day with something that causes tumours which is evidently what he needs for his formula That's horrible So... - all of you..? - Yes We're sick and just waiting for our time to come After 5 months we're no longer useful That man is a monster! What have they done to Susan? If they've realized that she's a member of Interpol they'll kill her No, they'd just be wasting a woman that way She was in contact with agents in Madrid and if she's silent they may come to investigate They won't find us here Esther, come here Believing the scorpions were venomous, I'm sure she told the truth - I have good news - Yes? What is it? A woman in town died of cancer, she was 35 She was treated with oestrogen and buried this afternoon Excellent, that way we don't have to wait for one of ours I've already spoken to the other models and the serving staff about Margaret's sudden departure due to family matters You're a magnificent partner, thank you Peter, take care of everything Something's wrong, it's been 40 hours of silence The transmitter has been tested twice Sadly I don't think the silence is due to some accident I agree. What will you do, notify the brigade? No, tonight we'll pay a visit to Dr. Mann Go get the car and prepare things for the trip, I'll watch this Agreed Pincers - Sarah - Yes? Let them know You can come in It's closed Go see who it is Peter Yes? It's the Interpol agents that were here the other day I was expecting them, I would've been disappointed if they hadn't come They're headed to the basement Take care of them, I won't stand for failure Take care of that one They're releasing gas! Hold it Freeze Turn around Where do you shut off the gas? Through this door Hold it Let's go ...and with large doses of oestrogen I cause them to grow fibrotic tumours, that way my models become excellent breeding ground for prime material for my formula - You're crazy - It's possible But my madness is sublime What's the life of one of those poor wretches worth against an original masterpiece? Sublime? You're a common murderer You're insults are boring me young man Sarah? Turn around Untie me! - Take care of things here - Yes 9004 calling for a helicopter Get close and lower the ladder The End Translation: Turdis July 2009
