I wish I could escape from this gilded cage. Free to fly away like you, my little friend. Back to the real world I've all but forgotten. Fleia? Fleia? Are you in the studio? Get ready, they're gonna move out. Let's kick ass. Terrorists, man! I always say you gotta be prepared. Don't move! You're all under arrest. Oh, shit! Christ, here we go again. Another glorious day in the city. At least it beats being a damn traffic cop. I don't know how I'd manage without people shooting at me every day. Team A ready to go. B Team ready to go. C Team ready. This is the police. We can guarantee your safety to the airport. As a gesture of goodwill we want you to let the children go. If we don't get what we want then you can whistle Dixie! You get us our fucking truck or the kids are gonna eat lead! Go! Now listen! This'll be your final briefing. Down here they've got heavy armour so avoid that route. Here they've only got troopers so this is the way to go. - Where you goin'? - The bathroom. Stupid asshole, thinks he fucking knows the lot! Hold your breath, it's CS gas! Oh, my God, they'll be comin' in! Don't move! Eat it! You're lucky you got caught, if you were up there you'd be toast. - Mommy! - Oh, Tamomi! Stay in here. Buliaros! Evans? Evans! Grenade! Hit the deck! Booby trap! Attention! One hostile has escaped. He's armed and dangerous. Two officers are down at the rear entrance. This guy's special. I think he knew we were coming. He got away from the others because he knew they'd had it. His best chance of escape was while we were busy. I guess he's part cyborg the way he broke those cuffs. He's all bastard! Freeze! That's not a very friendly gesture. - I've told you not to come here. - Things didn't go too well today. Everyone except me is dead. I need more people. You need landmates. If I could get that kind of hardware I could put it to good use. Go and see this man. And what's this guy do? - He's an arms dealer. - An arms dealer? They still exist? I'm a cop, you're a terrorist, it's just supply and demand. Good old-fashioned commerce, that's all. It always was and always will be the way of the world. OK, Bully, I got it. The image in the data bank is an exact match for the guy you and Deunan caught coming out of the john yesterday. Yeah, yeah, OK, so who is the mystery man? He goes by the name of AJ Sebastian. He's a career terrorist, a hard case with a string of convictions. He got caught in an attempt to bust into Gaia. That's how he lost his eye and ear. He's one determined asshole. That's all the info I've got here, you want anything else you'll have to go to the SSSP. - Hey, Deunan. - Buliaros, how's it going with you? OK. I've been checking our suspect's file. His name's AJ Sebastian. The SSSP has taken over the case. I knew that guy was big trouble. Central Admin wanna get involved. So why are the SSSP interested in this man? He was once caught trying to sneak into Gaia. I reckon this guy's not a terrorist because he wants money. He's out to change the world, that's why the SSSP are after him. And that's why I'm applying for a secondment. And leave SWAT? I don't believe it! You'll miss all the excitement. Anyway, so where you gonna transfer to? I'm going to Investigation. Huh? You can't be serious! What for? I wanna find that son of a bitch and kill him. She hasn't brought anyone back with her this time. Thank God. Every human she brings has to be rehabilitated. The cost to social services and the police is getting extortionate. The General Management Control Office are aiming for total integration to Olympus. Excuse me a moment. Well-meaning idiots! The outside world doesn't breed human beings - it's full of lunatics. Experimenting with them will only destabilize Olympian society. They'll never integrate. How can they after living in that hell? Poor devils. What happened to the last pair Hitomi brought back? - They were put in a SWAT team. - They're excellent police officers but as people they're pretty damn weird. Excuse me. Inspector-General, it was AJ Sebastian. Again? Goddam him. This man has to be stopped at all costs. Nikkei, what were that couple's names? Nat Deunan and Buliaros Hecatombcales, both in SWAT. - Are they good enough for the job? - You mean AJ Sebastian? If everyone's glass is full I would like to propose a toast to the girl responsible for saving us from the ruins of the world outside and indeed to all of us. Cheers! Cheers! Everyone in this room has been rescued from the ruins. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to Hitomi. When I think how Buliaros had been crippled and blinded by the war and how they could rebuild him, give him a life again, it's marvellous! And when she comes back from her expeditions she finds the time to do casework for the people she saved and helps them settle into Olympus. But for her we'd all still be lost out there in that wasteland. Hello! I think you're very handsome. Hey! You haven't had a drink! I'd like to but I'm going on duty at nine o'clock tonight. What? No! No! You can't! It's not fair! Hey, Hitomi, what are you doing? You're embarrassing this poor guy. Piss off! Handsome! Come on back to my place later on! Now, then. Take this. Come on, wake up, you can't go to sleep here. Is she all right? What's going on? Look at the sky! It must have been one hell of an explosion. Look at it! - What is that? - Oh, no, that must be Tartarus! What am I going to do? - There goes Karen. - Just our luck to be off duty now! Come on, move it, you guys! It's no good, he's had it. That son of a bitch can't be far away. It's OK, he's one of us. OK, the coast's clear. You OK? Yeah, it's just the suit got fucked in the firefight. One of them got away onto the upper level. - Leave him to us. - See ya. Hello, Olympus Television newsroom. It's that terrorist! I'm sorry, go ahead. Today the Human Liberation Union attacked the Tartarus block, HQ of the biodroids. This action is a warning to them. We remind them that they were created to serve mankind, not to govern it. They have risen to power out of the chaos caused by the last war, they have no moral or legal claim to government and we refuse to recognise them as such. We will continue to oppose them. We have also come by certain information which tells us that the biodroids are going to deploy robot police in areas they consider to be volatile. This is not the act of a benign servant, it is the act of an oppressor. It is clear to us the biodroids intend to maintain power by any means. But it is not too late. We call on the human population of earth to rise up and shake off the shackles of tyranny. Freedom to humanity! Anything else? That's the usual crazy bullshit we've come to expect from these lunatics. If only they were crazy. That Sebastian is up to something. What was he doing in the Tartarus block? Was anything taken during the raid on Tartarus? Quite a lot. Information retrieval mainly. Files on two biodroids are missing but we don't know who they relate to. - The SSSP are investigating. - When do you expect their report? Three days. On the plus side, the incubation units were undamaged and all current foetuses remain valid. The programme's continuing at full capacity. Holy shit, that thing really kicks ass! Look, Buliaros, about that attack on the Tartarus block. Yeah, I know - Sebastian was there. If only we'd been on duty. Yeah. I applied for a transfer to Investigation as well. Brilliant! If we can't get a transfer we'll take leave and look for the bastard. This prototype version of the Multipede Cannon has to be operated by a technician on board but thanks to scientists, that will become a thing of the past. In future they'll be controlled by Gaia, Olympus's central computer. So no matter where a Multipede Cannon is located it will be able to react as a coordinated response to terrorism wherever it occurs. That response is selective depending on the threat, ranging from heavy artillery down to .50mm laser-guided water-cooled machine guns. Kieran. I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of that lot! That's all we have time for. Next week... The prototype Multipede is going to be moved at seven tomorrow. So phase one is tonight. Deunan, Buliaros, this report stinks. You got? What the fuck do they call this? The Marie-friggin'-Celeste? Absent! This report wants them in Central Admin. My fucking life. Now what? Yeah, this is Lieutenant Bronx of the Olympus SWAT. Everyone's out. Buliaros? Yeah, this is his phone but he's out. The best I can suggest is that you leave a message. Yesterday I can't get rid of 'em, today I can't find 'em. - See you guys later. - Yeah, take it easy. It's three days since we put in for transfers and we've heard nothing. And nothing from the terrorists. As far as the transfers are concerned, God knows, but the terrorists must move before the Multipede Cannons are deployed. They can't let their deployment go unchecked. - Yeah. Hey... - What's up? Karen! Oh, hi there. I heard you got injured. Right. Just one of those things. Yeah, it was bad luck. For Evans' grave? No, they're for my wife. She's also in this cemetery. Thank you for coming. She was always pleased to get visitors. My wife's death was the greatest tragedy to have happened in my life. - Did your wife die in an accident? - No, she couldn't adapt to life here so she became neurotic and finally killed herself. I sometimes think she had no real choice. The organised environment suffocated her. In a way it was murder. How can you say that? This city is the most perfect place! I thought that too when I first came here. There's no unemployment, there's proper health care, housing. You name it, we've got it, but we no longer live, we just exist. Living means fighting, struggling for advancement. It's a fundamental part of being human - you deny it, you deny life itself. Like poor Fleia, she had everything but in reality she had nothing. There was nothing for her to live for, strive for, so she decided she couldn't stand it and threw herself from our window. Face it, we're living in a human zoo, the administration is the keeper. That's not true, most people are happy here. That's because 80% of them are biodroids, designed for life here. They're programmed to operate here so it's no surprise they're happy. Come along now, children. - Oh, yeah! - Come on, let's go, hurry up! 80% of them are biodroids, designed for life here. They're programmed to operate here. He's round the back. - Hiya. - Hi. Is it ready yet? Yeah, sure it's ready. Just as you requested. There. As you said, I've made the armour half-thickness all round. Excellent. It's not my business but you won't get much protection from it now. - I know. - It's your funeral. It will be if anybody uses armour-piercing bullets. Let me worry about getting blown away by some asshole. If I can get top speed out of this suit I'll be too fast for anyone to shoot me. Well, if your chief finds out you'll be in trouble. This is against all regulations. You forget about the regulations, I paid you cash in hand for that job so just think about how you'll spend it. And anyway it's like you said, if I die, it's my funeral. What's that? That one? That's Deunan's, she trashed her landmate. She's pretty hard on landmates so I persuaded her to buy this one, it's more expensive but a lot better made. But I bet she wrecks it within a week. - I see. She'll be a strong opponent. - Don't you mean rival? Sure. Deunan, where you goin'? - So what kept you? - I was having a shower, all right? - Why? You're not seeing a guy. - Exactly. Come on, let's move it. - Please do come in. - Yes, ma'am! Stand easy, go take a seat and listen up. Now, I'll come straight to the point. You will find this terrorist, Sebastian, and kill him. Understand, this man is not to be arrested. But ma'am, that contravenes section 38 of the freedom charter. True, but Sebastian is a special case and we must employ special measures to stop him. I have chosen you because you've taken an interest in the case. All the state files on Sebastian will be made available for you to inspect. Give this case the highest priority. All leave is cancelled until Sebastian is dead. Good afternoon. And one more thing... the best of luck to you both. - It was a hologram! - Sure was. Pretty crap one, too. It gets on my tits that she wouldn't see us face to face. Yeah. Too good to come into close contact with us humans. - So we follow orders like she said. - Sure. No turning back now. You fuckers! Give me my fucking phone call! Hey, look, Deunan and Buliaros are here. I thought you guys had gone on leave. What brings you back here? They've been on their goddam honeymoon! Hey, Deunan, if it doesn't work out I'll be your new boyfriend. Bang! Bang-bang-bang-bang bang! Buliaros, you've got some messages. Most of them from women! Thanks. You're sure you'll be all right on your own? Fine. Besides, there was no time to arrange help. It'll be much easier to break in and make the snatch on my own. Excellent. I'll have the Multipede Cannon and you'll have the girl. - You know where to take her? - Yes. Good. It's unfortunate these two cops live in the same block as Hitomi. Don't worry, I won't let Buliaros and Deunan get in the way. I'll take them out of the picture first. - Well, good luck. - And the same to you, my friend. Thanks. Olympus Police Department. How can I help you? Sorry to keep you waiting. - OK, let's go. - I have to do something first. I need to speak to Buliaros and Deunan - and quick! What do you mean they're on vacation? I've got important information! Hello? Hello? That stupid old man was double-dealing with the cops, which is a pity when you consider all the effort we put in. Yeah. I think you can relax, he's not gonna tell anyone anything any more. Running this bar and the huge profits obviously wasn't enough for him. I guess he needed the extra thrill of being a spy. This is it, then, time we split up. I don't even know your name. After today it won't matter, but for the record I'm Sebastian. I'm Karen. Karen Mausolos. Hello, Buliaros, how you been? - Sorry there's no picture but... - Neleus? ...the wrong hands. I've got some really hot information - but it'll cost you! - What the hell does he want? - Who is it? - It's my old tip-off master. He's been out of crime too long to hear anything now. You'll find it's worth hearing. I'll wait for you at my place. Just in case you can't remember, it's downtown near the river, one block from the hospital. See you soon! Look, there's another one coming up. I still haven't heard from you. It's most unlike you to let an opportunity like this slip away. You think I'm bullshitting you? I tell you, this case involves a policeman! And furthermore I know who, so if you want to find out who the traitor is you'd better get down here now! The longer you leave it the higher the price will rise. See you soon. Hello! It's me, Hitomi! Sorry to bother you but I've been having trouble with my front door. Could one of you look at it before I go to bed? Haven't you sifted through that data yet? It's taking forever, but when I finish you fancy a few beers? OK, I'll see you later. Oh, deep shit! Deep shit! This is Athena. What? The biodroid data relating to Hitomi was removed before the raid on Tartarus? OK, thank you. Get me the SSSP now! That's far enough! Do what I say and this won't go off. Now drop the gun. Don't even think about it! Move and I'll blow your fucking head clean off! Hey, Buliaros! Bull's-eye! That's enough! Hit the deck! - Get out of my fucking way! - Shut it, bitch! All right, hotshot, drop the girl or I'll fill you so full of holes you'll be the next Mr Swiss Cheese! You're pissing me off - drop the fucking girl! What the fuck? Bastard! Get off! Don't shoot, you might get Hitomi! Let's move! Hitomi! The Engineer calling the Driver. The Engineer calling the Driver. This is the Driver. I got the tag. I repeat, I got the tag. Engineer out. And before you go, make sure all the weapons systems are on-line. You're wasting your time, Gaia will abort your command. Thank you, and speaking of abortions! As you know, Gaia, the central computer, controls power, water, weapons - everything. What you don't know is there is an override key built into Hitomi's DNA. That key is now in the hands of the terrorists. They now have the power to shut down the entire city. You can see what the consequences might be. We've got to get her back! We understand this is serious but why were we arrested? You were arrested on suspicion of being spies. No way! We have for some time been aware of a security leak in the police but we haven't been able to identify the guilty party. We suspect you both - Sebastian escaped from your custody without any apparent problem during the tower block siege. Now, either he is very clever or else he didn't so much escape from you as walk free, which means you are terrorist sympathizers and as you weren't born in Olympus... You... you know that's not true! We've always served this city! True. It would be the perfect cover for your subterfuge. And when Hitomi was kidnapped you were there and the terrorist escaped. That's because you had us arrested! They were obeying orders and you prevented them firing. But Hitomi could have been killed in their fire! We can replicate Hitomi - it would be better she died than they have her. - That's worse than murder! - Don't be ridiculous! She's a biodroid built to fulfil specific needs so don't give me any shit about the sanctity of human life. Hitomi still counts as our friend. It's just as well the girl's your friend and not mine because dead or alive we need her. Pardon me, ma'am. We've received some information from an old informant of mine. If you'll let us follow it up you'll see your trust is justified. Dead men can't talk. True, but he's already told us the important thing - they're being assisted by the police. - What are they going to do? - I ain't got a clue. But I'll bet good odds it's gonna be big and there'll be a lot of shooting. We oughtta buy some new guns. OK, everyone pay attention. We will be arriving at Olympus City in approximately 12 hours. We are going to defend the city against unspecified terrorist attack. The emphasis is on defence so don't blow the shit out of the place in a fit of over-enthusiasm. Over and out. Computer access one is destroyed. Computer access two destroyed. Access three destroyed. Ma'am, three of the four computer access terminals have been destroyed. Good. Excellent! Now there's only one place they could gain access to Gaia and we have it surrounded. So come on, you fuckers, let's see you try it. Time to get going. Karen Mausolos? We're from the Olympian Mental Institute. We'd like to ask you questions about your late wife. Your wife made frequent trips to the Institute before her death. Undoubtedly her sanity had been disturbed - tell us what caused that disturbance. Anything might help us. Whatever you can remember. We must help you, then. What? Get off me! You have no right! - Quiet, Mr Mausolos. - Where are you taking me? Answer me, damn you! You can't just take me from my home! What do you want of me? You have to tell me! What are you looking at? - Karen! Hello, Karen! - Fleia! Oh, no, it can't be! It's my memories. You have no right to access that information! You can't treat me like this, you bastards! This is like being a laboratory rat - I'm a human being! It's time for us to get going. No way will I ever help terrorists to destroy the city of Olympus! Stay away - remember, I'm a biodroid and we can't do anything that could harm our beautiful environment. I'm not asking you as a biodroid, I'm asking you as a human being. Time to change! Hold it! Hold it there, buddy! Look, there's Karen! Hi, I've got an extra landmate to deliver. Here are the papers. Hi, Karen! Deunan! Yeah, that's all in order. What's wrong? This case involves a policeman. Shit! Come on! What? All right, get movin'! You - contact headquarters! - What's goin' on? - I heard Hitomi in that truck. - What? - We're looking for a crooked cop! What? You can't mean Karen! I don't believe it! We know he thinks Olympus murdered his wife! So we've got you now. Or is it possible you've got us? Fire! Make sure that the driver is well and truly dead! Bastard! Give up, Karen, you're finished! Catch! Karen! - You have to get out of my way. - We can't do that. You have to. If the remote-control Multipede Cannons come on-line they can only be operated by Gaia. The planet will be under its control. Humans will no longer control their destiny! - Where are the gunships? - We'll be there as soon as we can. What can we expect if he takes Gaia out of service? Everything would go off-line. - Shit! - What? When Gaia goes off-line the only thing still operational is the prototype Multipede Cannon. If that fell into the wrong hands we'd be defenceless against it. Surrender now, Karen! Never! I won't tell you two again, you'll have to kill me to stop me! I can't let Olympus survive - it treats us like laboratory rats! Hitomi, get out of the way! No, you don't, you fuckers! Don't go in there, Hitomi! Please... You must go in. Go in now... What? It's all mine now. Attention all units! Proceed to the Multipede Cannon bays immediately! Attention! Attention! This is a red alert! This is a red alert! All citizens should make their way to the city's communal bunker complex as soon as possible! Too fuckin' late! Call out the air team! Right, do what you can. We'll get Gaia's functions back. - Gaia, ma'am? - Fast! - Right. - It's our only hope. Our only hope is to get Gaia switched back on. I just hope we make it in time! Gaia has defensive systems to prevent unauthorised access - it'll kill you! We have to disconnect the DNA lock first! Come back here! The only thing that can stop that Multipede Cannon is Gaia. Somehow we have to find a way of getting it back on. - What are you doing? - We've come to reconnect Gaia. I love it! This is my kind of machine! Nothing and no one is gonna stop me now. You boys are in deep shit for trying! Get us some backup! We're getting trashed! - Is this it? - No, these are Gaia's databanks. We need to get to the ROM drive at the centre of this lot. It uses all the information stored here. Be careful, it's defended by remote security systems. Let's move it! Our best chance is to keep moving. It makes us a harder target for the security systems. It's a piece of piss so far. - Have you been hurt? - Buliaros! D-Flight, this is Control. We need you here and we need you now! This is D-Flight, we're still 20 minutes away. There's about 200 metres of passage to go. And how many more booby traps? You two will have to run it alone. I'll cover you from back here. Now get moving! Buliaros! Don't argue, just get on with it. My leg's completely fucked, there's no way I'd make it. When this is over you can take me shopping for a new leg. Don't stop, just keep going straight and don't even look, OK? Go! Hey, tough guy, good shooting! This way. What a fuckin' day. It's hopeless, we'll never find out which is the DNA circuit lock. Useless! Sorry. If those reinforcements don't get here we're fucked! - It's here! - Yes? Brilliant! Hurry! So what's it look like I'm doing? It's useless - we can't even slow it down! Olympus, you're finished. There it is. That circuit is responsible for the DNA lock. We just have to break it. - And that's your job. - But my right hand's hurt. Use your left - you're a trained shot, you've a better chance than me. One o'clock, come down left. Now you're too far left. Just keep calm. Right a bit. Down a bit. You've got two rounds left. Remember, concentration is the key. Shit. Squeeze the trigger, don't yank at it. What the fuckin' hell? Oh, Christ... Fuckin' cocksucker. This is Mission Control to all units. The Multipede Cannon has been neutralized. Return to base immediately. The threat to Olympus is now over. The doctors say I'll be up and about in a week. It takes more than bullets to put you down. I'm the one you should blame. I'm sorry. That's nonsense. You mean that? If someone as handsome as Karen asked me to do something I would. - You're just jealous! - No, no, no, not at all. In a cage you're protected from the real world outside. That's not living - sooner or later you have to escape.
