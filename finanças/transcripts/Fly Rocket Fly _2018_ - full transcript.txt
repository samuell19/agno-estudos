In the midst of moon-landing euphoria among Russians and US-Americans came the news: "There's a small company developing its own rockets." That was incredible. OTRAG was the first private aerospace company. Orbital Transport and Rockets, Inc. I heard they wanted to launch a rocket, and that the launch would be somewhere in Africa. In Zaire, as it turned out. We had to look at a map: Where is Zaire? I got the feeling that for them... coming to the jungle was like opening a door to a fairy-tale. They looked around like children as they got off the plane. If you want to invest in a risky operation, what do you do? You meet a venture capitalist, find an angel investor and go to Silicon Valley. But if your angel investor is called Mobutu, things start getting a bit fishy. It's a crazy story. We called him either "Kaiser" or "Boss." I never saw him again. All I heard for a long time was he was living in California. He's bound to be somewhere in Indonesia. WITH MACHETES TO THE STARS It all began when I read the works of Wernher von Braun. I wrote a letter to Wernher von Braun as a student, asking him for advice: Should I become an astronaut or a rocket scientist? He said, "You're way too tall and heavy for an astronaut. We need light people.” So I took the easy road. It's very unlikely you'll get to be an astronaut, anyway. I spend approximately three hours a day in the water. Underwater, you're practically weightless. Astronauts train in and underwater, too. If you're moving that slowly, it's like being in space. BIKENDRIK ISLAND, PACIFIC OCEAN We're here in the middle of the West Pacific, the Marshall Islands, on a small island called BIKENDRIK, which means little beach. I live here alone with my wife, and the island is three acres in size. Two years ago, the Saudis came and wanted to invest one billion dollars. They asked me to build a launch site in Saudi Arabia. But I wouldn't have survived it. ROCKET SCIENTIST, FOUNDER OF OTRAG Too many peoples would've been against it. And I wasn't interested, anyway, because they obviously wanted to use rockets for military purposes, too. That's the ambivalent thing about rockets: They can be used for both military and civil purposes. CAUTION! RISK OF EXPLOSION GERMAN ROCKET PIONEERS MADE FIRST FLIGHT ATTEMPTS IN BERLIN. READY FOR BLAST-OFF! A world first! The first successful long-range rocket flight after twelve years of research and development. THE NAZIS AND WERNHER VON BRAUN LAUNCHED THE FIRST ROCKET INTO SPACE, THE V-2. THE ALLIES DIVIDED GERMAN ROCKET SCIENTISTS AMONG THEMSELVES AS SPOILS OF WAR. THE RUSSIAN SATELLITE "SPUTNIK" TRANSMITTED THE FIRST SIGNALS FROM OUTER SPACE. THE SPACE RACE HAD BEGUN. WITH WERNHER VON BRAUN'S HELP, THE AMERICANS LANDED ON THE MOON. The Earth rising. IN GERMANY, LITTLE OF THE FORMER ROCKET KNOWLEDGE HAD REMAINED. I was born in Stuttgart, and was six at the end of World War Ill. A hobby for us boys was collecting old munitions. We'd break them open, lay the gun powder in little lines and... set it on fire. A very risky venture that we naturally didn't mention to our parents. But after the War, all we had was bomb splinters and ammunition. Those were the toys we had, we didn't have any others. My fathers was a chairman of Südzucker AG, the largest sugar producer in Europe. As a child, I got insight into a whole range of professions from joiners, smiths, turners... And that got me very interested in engineering. As a student, I founded a rocket club, which led to my studies in aerospace engineering. It was an exciting time. We still lived under the Occupation Statute of Germany, which made generating supersonic flow illegal. In 1965, I began to study at the University of Stuttgart, and there I met Lutz Kayser. GRADUATE ENGINEER FOR AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY He'd founded the AGRR, the Association of Rocket Engineering and Space Technology at the University of Stuttgart. We had an old bunker that we students had equipped with an infrastructure featuring stairs, fuel tanks, wiring and measuring instruments. In a test stand, we tried out little rocket engines. We did our tests in a suburb of Stuttgart. Nowadays it'd be unthinkable! A residential area! We spent our days and nights there. We were the first in Germany to succeed in creating a supersonic flow. The American occupying power gave me special permission to do so. Mr. Kayser, are you and your colleagues the Wernher von Brauns of tomorrow? 1965 TV REPORT: "AERONAUTICS STUDENTS HELP THEMSELVES" We're trying to learn from the problems inherent in developing space technologies. NASA-ASTRONAUT AND PROFESSOR OF SPACE TECHNOLOGY The Germans had no space technology projects. They invested in what was called ELDO: The Europeans teamed up to build rockets of their own. It didn't work out. They exploded or whatever. There was no space technology in Germany. ELDO ROCKET WOOMERA, AUSTRALIA, 1970 The German Economic Minister back then, having spent 2.5 billion DM, posed the question... ...of whether there wasn't a cheaper way of getting to outer space. We applied for this research project. And, although we were still a group of students, we received 3.5 billion DM in funding to further our research. We hired some Americans for the software development, who had previously been on the Apollo program. NASA ENGINEER NASA ENGINEER At Stuttgart's university, we had Germany's largest computer, a UNIVAC 1108. It filled a whole building. Then we came up with a totally radical concept, namely... to bundle a bunch of small rockets, which are cheap to batch-produce. PRESENTATION FILM OF THE RESEARCH GROUP, 1972 The propulsion of every module consists of 36 liquid-fueled rocket engines. Selectively turning off certain engines makes the thrust vector controllable, obviating the need for expensive, vectored thrust engines. The handling of the fuel is easy and hazard-free. Our modus operand; was to employ available, batch-produced parts. Which is how, for example, we constructed an injection head that was driven by the motor of a Volkswagen windshield wiper. We became known for flying rockets with windshield wiper motors, but it was a good device for opening and closing the valve. Opening, thrust power, closing. This is precisely what the motor of a windshield wiper is good at. And this was our philosophy: not high-tech, but low-cost. I was hired in 1973. We were a small group of people in a workshop in Stuttgart who tried to permanently improve every part of the rocket to the point of micro mechanics. Over two years, we drove back and forth between Stuttgart and Lampoldshausen... MECHANICAL ENGINEER ...with an engine in the car trunk that we'd try out at the workshop test stand. INSTITUTE OF SPACE PROPULSION LAMPOLDSHAUSEN, BADEN-WÜRTTEMBERG In Lampoldshausen, we did around 2,000 combustion experiments with these low-cost engines. It took us two years to figure out that we could use another fuel: Nitric acid. It has a higher density SO you can carry more of it. A rocket is basically a Coke can plus content. The more you can fit into it, the more power you get out of it. DANGER! NO ENTRY We were already working in conjunction with France, and they became curious about what we were doing there. TEST BENCH MANAGER IN LAMPOLDSHAUSEN They were concerned it might be too competitive a rival to the ARIANE project. There's still far to go, but soon it will come true. In the 1980s, 20 to 30 of these communication satellites will navigate through space, broadcasting TV programs to living rooms all around the world. EVENING TV NEWS In 1972/73, the countries of Europe were in the process of founding the European Space Agency. At that time, we were told, "Great research, but we can no longer finance it, and we don't want to, either." So we weren't able to carry on. That meant one of two things: Either we had to shelve all our work and say, "It's over." But we didn't want to do that. Particularly not Lutz Kayser. He said, "If we don't get any research grants, we'll turn it into a commercial enterprise.” And eventually, we founded a private joint-stock company: OTRAG. Stuttgart: Technical office of OTRAG, Orbital Transport and Rockets Inc. Standing for progress. The particular thing about space programs is that they cost a lot of money. And I don't mean a few million, but hundreds of millions. At the least. The original plan was for Wernher von Braun to be chairman. But he had renal disease, so he recommended Dr. Debus as chairman. BERLIN, JUNE 8, 1942 ACCEPTANCE OF SS-APPLICANT KURT DEBUS HEAD OF THE SS MAIN OFFICE He was a figurehead... POLITICAL SCIENTIST He was useful for advertising, which wasn't bad. Mr. Debus is wearing a tie, while Mr. Kayser is holding a model of the OTRAG rocket. GRADUATE ENGINEER Mr. Debus has lots of experience from the moon-landing program, while Mr. Kayser: he's presenting something. I thought, "God is this guy sexy!" At that point, all rocket developments had been carried out by the military or government scientists. Together with a consortium of companies. Our challenge was to achieve as much with only one company. He had a touch of arrogance. And this gaze that saw beyond everything. WIFE OF LUTZ KAYSER Most people were smaller. He mostly didn't mean it that way, but he was absent. His thoughts were elsewhere. Explaining how a rocket is constructed and gets launched isn't very easy, so we decided to build a model. We bought all the aluminum tubes and broomsticks we could find in Stuttgart... MECHANICAL ENGINEER ...in order to build what was really quite a nice model. One time, Debus said... He'd been drinking some wine and he said: "I know this thing will fly someday! CIVIL ENGINEER And I know that Kayser is capable. But you'll have to keep him down to earth." I still remember that. OTRAG also served tax purposes. He had a model that offered tax deductions. It was completely legal. I don't know how it worked exactly, but it was an investment opportunity for the wealthy, dentists or whatever, who wanted to save taxes. If you invested a million dollars, you could deduct a loss of 2.6 million dollars. The deal of a lifetime in this courtyard: As a company for write-offs, OTRAG has received nearly 100 million DM, mostly from wealthy doctors. So with this single element, we can build rockets of any kind and of any size to match all requirements. It was a typical start-up, using crowdfinancing, if you will, with 1,500 shareholders. I found that pleasant: having many small shareholders giving on average 100,000 DM, rather than having one big one, who could then tell you what to do. We all believed in this project so deeply... LAWYER ...that we also invested in it by purchasing shares with our wages. TV REPORT: "THE SKY IS THERE FOR EVERYONE" Doubts are arising, however, as to whether Kayser's estimation is accurate. This might be due to the fact that in Germany, scientists who want to make big bucks or be entrepreneurs aren't taken very seriously. Although this rocket hasn't yet gone into production and a prototype doesn't yet exist, experts nonetheless believe the rocket is viable. At this point, we had fully developed the technology. And the next stage were test flights. For safety reasons, they couldn't be conducted in Germany because of the high population density. In 1974, there was a historic boxing match called "The Rumble in the Jungle," which was held between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. One of the men who brought this fight from New York to Zaire was Frederic Weymar, an international business man. We met him on a flight, by chance. We started talking and he told us that he arranged boxing fights and so on. We told him we were building rockets, but had no launching site. And so he asked, "How about Zaire?" Frederic Weymar arranged a meeting with then-president Mobutu Sese Seko. I liked him, but of course it's like... at some point he just started floating 20 cm above the ground like an opera singer. He behaved like a living God. He said that's what people needed. And if there were any profits, the boss usually got 10%. "We don't call that corruption, it's my due.” In a way, he was right about that. When you're corrupt in the western world, you take 100% or 80%. So in terms of morals, ethics, it's better in Africa than in Europe or America. He said, "Take a plane and search for what you need. Then simply choose a territory. And I want the first observation satellites, so I can protect my borders." SPACE HISTORIAN Mobutu was an extraordinarily corrupt man. At the time, he was supported by the French, the Americans, and the Europeans in general. Because, on the other hand, was neighboring Angola, which was heavily influenced by Warsaw Pact countries. Zaire, or rather Congo, is one of the world's richest countries in terms of raw materials. TO REALIZE THE PRESIDENT'S SLOGAN: ONE UNIFIED CURRENCY FOR A GREAT ZAIRE When OTRAG initiated its project there in 1977, this country, which was as large as Europe, was anything but safe and stable. The Cold War was raging. Just a few weeks later, we signed a contract between OTRAG and the country of Zaire. BUSINESSMAN REPUBLIC OF ZAIRE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE The contract included the unrestricted use of 100,000 square kilometers of territory. That's as a big as East Germany was, which encompassed 104,000 square kilometers. An enormous territory that our 30 to 50 employees could barely maintain. The contract was signed in 1975, and was irrevocable until 2025. We found a high plateau right in the middle of this territory. At the bottom, near the Luvua River, was the wild jungle. At the top, there's a climate like in the Swiss highlands. On three sides are steep cliffs, making it completely inaccessible. Mess Muhila was a stopover. There we stored our transportation rovers, components, the tents and military-style equipment. Everything we needed at the start. From Mess Muhila, it was a 22-minute helicopter flight to the plateau. MUNICH, NAIROBI, KINSHASA We than rappelled a group of people with chainsaws from the helicopter. They quickly cleared a spot of 20 to 30 meters for the helicopter to land. And slowly the plateau was made viable. I'm still homesick for Central Africa. Somehow one feels at home there. Maybe it's because we emigrated from there a couple of million years ago. The chimpanzees on the plateau liked us right away. They started smoking cigarettes, and ate everything we ate. They wanted to become humans. It's amazing how close to animals we still are. You can observe that in Africa better than anywhere else. "Kapani Tono" means "split butt” in the local language. They observed it from the bottom and it looked like buttocks. And the name stuck. During the first months, when we still had no homes... CARPENTER ...we slept in large safari tents. There were no roads on the territory. We had to build them first. Mr. Loebermann, head of the Stewering Company, brought up the drilling machines. At first, I thought they were crazy. They were seven or eight people. In the beginning, they went there with rubber gloves and frozen steaks and so on... to avoid disease. It was so surreal. They wanted to go to the end of the world, where no man has ever been. I had a look at them, and they were no bush people. I was just thinking to myself: What are these guys doing in the bush? After I visited the plateau, I was hooked, too. When would you ever again get the chance to set something up in no man's land? Kapani Tono is perfect in terms of weather. It even cools down at night. If you went down to the swamps, though, that's where it started. We came with construction machines and Range Rovers. Those old things. We drove about 370 kilometers, taking over three weeks. It was a back-breaker. If you fly over the bush or see it on TV, it looks very beautiful and innocent, like paradise. But not when you're in it! Sometimes we had to cross through swamps, which was complicated with our trucks. It takes time to build dams. If you have bulldozers, it's OK. He really managed to build a four-kilometer long landing strip up on this plateau in the jungle. The airfield was listed as Luvua Airport on international maps. So it could've served as an emergency landing field, though we only had a very limited supply of fire extinguishers. We couldn't have extinguished a Boeing 747. Apart from the Stewering Company and the construction sites, we also founded an airline, ORAS, standing for Otrak Range Air Service. They were four-engined planes. We moved everything we needed with these heavy-duty... transport planes. I bought old military planes from the English Air Force. We painted them red so we could find them. I flew on them twice. For 18 hours, if memory serves. BUTCHER AND COOK That was the flying time. Plus two fuel-stops. Quite interesting. Nobody could get there without our help. We had to fly people in. Zaire is a Francophile country. People speak French there. The indigenous people had hardly encountered whites before. They were regularly employed and received salaries. We had a big open tent where the employees assembled rockets. It was basically a blue and white beer tent. We called the tent the "Bavarian Embassy." MECHANICAL ENGINEER We at times worked with machines out in the open. We built a frame to erect the rocket using local wood. The actual launch tower wasn't delivered on time, so they asked if I could do it. I said, "We'll see!” With two twelve-meter long bars in a triangle, it was a terrific frame. I handed over the tower and prayed to God it would work. Well, we had an architect who was very competent, but he was an idealist. LAUNCH AREA Our architect envisioned us building everything with local materials. We had a carpenter's workshop, power saws that we had to teach the locals to use. We built the furniture, doors and windows. I guess we built about twelve houses. And the so-called restaurant with its kitchen. It had a broad facade with windows and quite a view, plus a terrace. Inside, there was room for 60 to 70 people. We grew vegetables and salad. We also grew peanuts that we roasted ourselves. We did a lot of interesting stuff. We tried to be self-sufficient, but we still needed to have good German wine and beer flown in by plane. We had the naturally grown marijuana. We sometimes smoked it at night because it's better than any sleeping pill. One-and-a-half years after arrival, we conducted our first launch. Even back then, we were in negotiations with various countries. We could've earned a few hundred million dollars. There was an incredible spirit of optimism. We definitely thought it'd be successful. It was May 17, 1977. A very exciting day for all of us. And then at A minus 10, as usual, Lutz and I planted our feet firmly on the ground because then it starts shaking. And the thing blasts off. You can't sense anything else around you, you just count to ten. And if it's still flying at ten, then it was a success. I was kind of the filmmaker and photographer, with a Hasselblad camera like the astronauts on the moon had. The employees had all taken shelter, of course. And then came the countdown. To zero. From ten to zero. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, Ignition! It blasted into the blue sky above Zaire. It had a payload of one ton, so it flew ten kilometers high without a problem. We had a party then, and everyone involved had to smoke fat Havanas that Kayser handed out. That was a reward. THANKS FOR YOUR VALUED PARTICIPATION IN THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL OTRAG ROCKET LAUNCH. The rockets didn't have names. We hadn't come up with one. I'd suggested we call them WOTAN (Odin), an acronym standing for what translates as Economic Orbital Carrier of All Payloads. But then people said, "No, that's Wotan (Odin), you can't do that." Too Nordic! In America, they used to name their rockets after Greek and Roman Gods. From Hercules to Saturn, Jupiter... So it would've been fitting. I finished my studies at the ENA in 1977, and got my first job at the Department of State. At the time, they oversaw delicate technologies. My first task was to figure out the whole OTRAG story. Of course, suspicions arose that perhaps "dark forces" in the German Government were trying to circumvent the prohibitions and bans created by the Paris Peace Treaties after the War, concerning the acquisition and possession of weapons of mass destruction and missiles. We were far from the beaten track. We didn't realize a thing. Our world up on the plateau was still fine. I prepared homemade sausage, meatloaf, white bratwurst or weisswurst, barbecue sausage... We also made a fine salami and everything, Krakauer... weisswurst... And they loved it. Homemade wurst, like blood sausage and liverwurst. I wanted to make everything for the squad that was in my repertoire. We also built a smoker oven where I smoked meat. If we needed more meat, we jumped in the helicopter and shot a gnu or an antelope. I tried to make "wild salami” with antelope and wild hog. There were lots of wild hogs. For me, it was a real adventure. A real adventure. STUTTGART ROCKET TEAM Then our aluminum construction-site scaffolding arrived. In keeping with our philosophy, we didn't use complicated launch towers. Not 120 meters high like the one for Saturn V, but an ordinary scaffold used for buildings. We had yellow overalls because Lutz Kayser's second wife once visited us... GRADUATE ENGINEER FOR AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGY ...saw the employees wearing swimming trunks, shorts and t-shirts, and said, "They can't be photographed like that. Frank, I'm getting you overalls and then you'll take nice pictures.” I loved the overalls. They looked really nice. The photos they sent me... WIFE OF AN OTRAG EMPLOYEE ...of the rocket and all the men looking up at it, was impressive alright. We didn't wear them often, actually. It was way too hot. MECHANICAL ENGINEER But for pictures, we'd have to dig them out. They looked great, but shorts were way better. Team spirit was really important to Mr. Kayser. Mr. Kayser never gave you the feeling he wanted to put you down or anything. I really enjoyed working there. That was his accomplishment. Mr. Kayser was very tall and handsome. He was a swell guy. All the girls wanted him. He enjoyed spending money. Not for equipment. He was good at accumulating capital. He wasn't a total playboy, but a pleasant born vivanrit. He wasn't unpleasant. He'd stay for a few days, then leave again. He'd be traveling for a week, then return. It was difficult to figure out. That's when the constant Learjet flights began. The plane would be full of champagne, which cost 150 to 200 DM per bottle. Lutz worked very hard from the age of 16 or 17. THIRD WIFE OF LUTZ KAYSER This was the first time he started to "relax," to experience something new and not just his rockets and technicians, etc. And of course it's all very tempting for a while. Lutz Kayser, 43 years old, a colorful figure in the international aerospace industry. TV REPORT: "THE SKY IS THERE FOR EVERYONE" Among other things, he's a partner and chairman of OTRAG. This company's aim is to put into orbit satellites at a price without asking what the satellites are being launched for. WARNING! OTRAG! THE MYSTERIOUS KAYSER EMPIRE FRENCH NEWS Is this man dangerous? That is the question. A charlatan to some, a genius to others, Kayser is the most controversial man in spaceflight. A GERMAN CAPE KENNEDY IN AFRICA? NUCLEAR ROCKETS IN AFRICA IS GERMANY BUILDING A BOMB? It wouldn't have got so bad if Moscow, East Berlin and Paris hadn't intervened, but we obviously underestimated the political significance. MOSCOW: WEST GERMANY BUILDING WORLD'S LARGEST ROCKET BASIS IN ZAIRE THE OTRAG COLONIAL EMPIRE Mr. Kayser, how serious do international rocket experts take you? GERMAN TV REPORT Sometimes, I wish we'd be taken less seriously, especially politically. What do your opponents fear? They accuse us of developing weapons because they don't want a private company to supply Third World countries with telecommunication and reconnaissance satellites. There's great demand for such satellites in the Third World. So far, the world powers have refused to give the Third World such satellites. OTRAG wanted to cooperate with the United Nations' Committee on the Uses of Outer Space. What else were we to do? That's the highest authority! It was all blocked. They feared we were building the second German V-2! A former chief editor of the New York Times, Tad Szulc, published an article in the girls magazine, Penthouse. It said the Germans were testing secret "cruise missiles” in Zaire by order of the German army. There's a very nice iron cross on this missile. This was a completely imaginary world. Extraordinary! But the scientists were as real as the giraffes. We really feared... getting murdered. In the south of Katanga, the Battle of Kolwezi took place. To refresh your memory, 800 Europeans were held hostage by armed forces supported by the Cuban government and coming from Angola. Kolwezi is still in the hands of the rebels. France sent the Foreign Legion, who saved most of the hostages' lives. But many soldiers lost their lives on that incredibly perilous operation. At the same time, you see the mad scientists tinkering away at their rocket. FRENCH NEWS Around Kolwezi, we see an isolated group of rebels keeping the political climate precarious. It was a brutal guerrilla war. Suddenly they claimed, "The Germans are building rockets for Mobutu." They felt threatened, and over the radio they gave us three months to leave. Otherwise, they'd storm the plateau and kill us. Our earlier serenity was gone. They wanted to arm the people on the plateau. I said, "That's crazy!" We're not professionals, so this would be more dangerous for us than for our enemies. We needed security guys. Look here's the second R.E.P. A cross and a skull. It's death. Everything is interrelated. It was all done by hand and a simple needle, no machines! We introduced security measures. We had security officers. So if you want to pierce here, it's like concrete. You pretty much need a hammer to push the needle into the skin. It hurts like hell, and if it reaches your heart, you'll die. There were three former Foreign Legionnaires. FOREIGN LEGIONNAIRE I have a machete which is always sharpened And chopping someone up with it is just great. I have a Corsican vendetta knife about this long. We're made for weapons with blades. Killing somebody with a gun is no fun. We commandos are blade people. They weren't the kind of people I'd expect to kill somebody with a knife, but if they were ordered to do so, maybe they could. I never asked any further questions. They were mannerly people. One of them was a sniper. He could hit anything that moved. My first impression on arriving on the plateau was not being able to take it seriously. Four former Legionnaires to guard a rocket base? That's not serious. With those few weapons, we couldn't have done more but limit the damage. We had two Kalashnikovs, four hunting rifles and one pistol, nothing more. There was no way in hell! Our first duty was to put together a black guard by training the locals, which my friend Raphael Ciani did. We were about 30 people, including the locals. They had been hired as guards and I taught them self-defense. There were uniforms that I bought from Germany. It was used army-wear which made them look like soldiers. But they weren't soldiers. FOREIGN LEGIONNAIRE It was all a pretense to seem assured. At night, they'd be guarding the bungalows. We lit fires in the evening, so everybody could sleep in peace. It was as simple as that. They didn't have weapons. I did. But they didn't, because we didn't trust them. It did make us feel a bit more secure. It was positive. The Legionnaires did their jobs, and we didn't want to sleep with machine guns under our pillows. The Legionnaires were soldiers of fortune who could adapt to almost any situation. Foreign Legionnaires aren't so much trained with weapons as with equipment. They have to master everything. We announced a launch, and somehow the governor of Lubumbashi heard about it. He told Mobutu that we were planning a launch on this particular date. Suddenly, he was standing on our airfield with his Hercules. It was interesting, he was nice. And we gave him sauerkraut and sausage. Mobutu also brought his extended family, and his entire administration, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of the Interior and a great number of journalists from all round the world. First we need to go 800 yards that way. Your wife and the kids can go to the restaurant. Can they see the rocket from the restaurant? Yes. Even if they stay here they'll see the launch. The rocket will go up behind this tree, so everybody will see it. As you can see, we're on this plateau. They cultivated it. Before it was uninhabited. It'll be scientifically valuable for Zaire. You have 200 workers here, all Zaireans. And 40 German scientists. The presence of OTRAG doesn't disturb me. On the contrary! It benefits my country! And in the middle, like a pencil, the rocket is positioned on a little stool. The rocket is now being refueled. It's sitting perfectly on its stool... It's sitting perfectly on its stool, yes. Fifteen, fourteen, thirteen... twelve, eleven, ten... nine, eight, seven... six, five, four... three, two, one... Zero. You see the hole? A good result all the same. There was a valve that didn't open. It went up too much like this. It has to be more like this. It's something with the guiding. - It needs to go on up. The propulsion system worked well, it was the guiding. Well, let's go have lunch... When the test in Mobutu's presence failed, it reinforced the position of the French, the Soviets, the Americans, maybe even the Germans. They finally convinced Mobutu to stop the project as it could only damage him. So in Mobutu's eyes the OTRAG mission became a source of problems, rather than a source of solutions for him. I was at a conference in Brussels, and suddenly the journalists wanted to film me, saying there's big news: Mobutu canceled your contract. ALL OVER FOR OTRAG TESTS CANCELED The Battle of Kolwezi had demonstrated that Mobutu was completely dependent on the military support of the West. This military support had been largely French. So when the French said "No" in 1979, OTRAG had to pack and go. What were we to do? There's no proper international court of arbitration for this. After a few years of trials, we would've won the legal battle, but our financing would've been lost. Mobutu "allegedly" did receive weapons and money for that. This was the end of OTRAG in Zaire. In the summer of 1979. He told us we could take our time disassembling everything, but no more rocket launches! The idea was that we would do one last joint activity for a day or two. A trip to the bush with motorcycles or something. They had the idea to fly a boat to a lake 80 or 90 kilometers away and go down the river. This was three weeks before we left. It looked nice from above, so we thought it'd be great paddling down the river. Just float down the river and relax. The boat had room for about eight. Some wanted to come along, others did not. I was young so I went along. We were all in a good spirits. The river was pretty wild. There were fairly large waves that we hadn't seen from above in the plane. We laughed as the waves hit us, and the boat took on a lot of water. We all enjoyed it. Some people were upset because we were running out of water and had to drink from the river. We all knew that we'd get diarrhea from it. But it's better than not drinking at all. Two of us had ridden their motorbikes upriver to meet us, as had been arranged. One of them didn't want to ride his bike back, so I agreed to go ashore and ride it for him. In the evening, the blacks came to tell us that a boat had washed up. "Is it yours?" We had the OTRAG helicopters and one from the Zaire Army. We checked everywhere, flying low over the river. There weren't many trees. Visibility was good and we had binoculars. But the river had so many branches. That's what complicated things. So we didn't find them all. There was only Raphael Ciani and me to recover the bodies. No one helped us. It was up to us alone. There were black bodies there in the water. The memory is so ghastly! We were a close team, good friends. It wasn't just colleagues who died, it was real friends. They died and I was the only one who survived. That's... I still don't understand that. I understand what happened, but not why. You need a bit of luck. It was impossible to understand how something like this could've happened. The greatest danger in the river are the hippos. They hide at the waterfalls, surface suddenly and can capsize a boat. It must've happened that way. There was a dead hippo lying in the water. Maybe they shot it. No one knows. My husband was the only one who was never found. We never learned anymore about it. He was simply missing. The Stuttgart public prosecutor tried to investigate, but soon gave up. The suspicion that a secret service had been involved still remained. But they could neither refute nor prove it. The death of seven technicians kind of broke OTRAG's back, the way they all died together. IN MEMORY OF OUR COLLEAGUES AND FRIENDS We put up a boulder on the plateau. It was hard work, because all the machines were already gone. And to my knowledge, it's still standing to this day. This is the first successful simulation on a computer of how a star can fall spiraling into a black hole and get swallowed over the event horizon by the black hole.
