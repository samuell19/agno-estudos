(turntable whirring) (debris crunching) (fire crackling) (rock clattering) (speaking in a foreign language) (door bangs) (Rachel sighs) (Rachel banging) Wake up sleepyhead. (door bangs) (exhales) Oh no. [Kallie Voice over] My name is Kallie Watts and I do not like Christmas. Now before you think I'm going full Scrooge for nothing, you should know that Christmas didn't like me first. See, every Christmas season something bad happens to my family. This year Christmas decided to give us an early preview: Our apartment burned down. The guy upstairs tried deep-frying a turkey for Thanksgiving. No one got hurt, but we lost everything. Thankfully some nice people donated a little money to help us move. The curse started long ago with dad's cancer diagnosis. He died a year later on Christmas Eve. Next we lost our home due to dad's medical bills. Then mom's car accident. So, we said goodbye car and hello bus pass. (both grunting) Grandpa died last Christmas. I still miss him a lot. So, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing merry about Christmas. It's official, worlds heaviest dresser. (Rachel sighs) I hope you're happy with how tall you are, because I'm pretty sure we just stunted your growth. You okay, kiddo? I was okay, until you decided to move us to the human version of Whoville. We moved here because someone was kind enough to lower the rent so we could afford it. Human Whoville is just a pleasant bonus. Look, I know how you feel about Christmas, but I love it. It's my favorite time of year actually. Even though it wants to destroy us? (laughs) Christmas does not want to destroy us. It wants to draw us closer, remind us how grateful we should be for all we have. Christmas burned up all we have. Technically that was Thanksgiving. (Kallie sneers) (plates clattering) (faucet clinking) (sighs) Sink's broke. No water. I'll look at it later. Our first visitor. - Mm. How do we decide who gets to answer it? Draw straws? Rock-paper-scissors? Gun duel in the street? Oo, gun duel, might turn our new neighbors against us though. You get this, I'll get our first phone call if we ever get a phone. Dealio. (Kallie gasps) - Welcome to the neighborhood. How precious are you! You must be Kallie Watts. Which would make you Rachel Watts. Yeah, how'd you now? I know everything there is to know of my neighborhood. I'm Nelly Green. I live in that really nice, big house across the street. (gasps) Oh. (door creaks) I guess your movers haven't come with your furniture yet? Actually, this is it, for now. Oh, that's right. You lost everything in the fire and your husband two years ago. Oh! So sad. Did you Google us? Don't worry Rachel, lots of eligible men out here. Rachel doesn't need help dating. Mm. Really? (gasps) You are a little bit younger than my darling Lisa, but I'll make her be your friend. No thanks necessary. Lisa is the most popular girl in school, and she is absolutely stunning. Takes after me thank goodness. (laughs) I am kind of the town leader. I don't know if you noticed the decorations coming into town? All me. (titters) But, it's not even December yet. Oh Honey, I had them put that up clear back in October. All in preparation for. "I'm dreaming of a green Christmas?" Oh, (titters) Green, like your last name. It's a Christmas party? It's not a Christmas party, it is the Christmas party. I hire the most wonderful Santa and I buy a ton of gifts for the local poor kids. When that Santa and his Elf walk in with that big sack of toys, those impoverished children just light up with joy. It's fabulous. - Wow! That's really generous of you. It is, isn't it? Oh, but I don't do it for the glory, no, of course not. No, I do it for those filthy, poor kids who would have absolutely nothing were it not for me. Oh, and I have tons of extra Christmas decorations if you need them. (titters) Thanks, but we're good. Suit yourself. But you really don't wanna be the only people in the town without decorations. I mean, even Otto has them. (gasps) Speaking of your neighbor, Otto, rumor has it, he is a former World War |I Nazi soldier in hiding. Mm-hmm. That's why he rents that house over there, so he can just run off at a moments notice. I'd steer clear. Why hasn't someone done something? (scoffs) I've been trying to get Otto kicked out of this neighborhood for years, but the police won't listen to me anymore and the town council just turns a blind eye. There is something going on over there. Every now and then, late at night a van comes in. Men go in and they come back out with different packages. Packages of what? That, my girl, is the mystery. But, don't worry. I've got a new angle, one that's gonna get Otto kicked out of this neighborhood once and for all. (titters) (rocks clattering) [Rachel] You alive? Barely. I miss having a TV. All in good time. So, how are you feeling about starting school tomorrow? Neuronal, irresolute. Flatulent. See, aren't you glad someone donated a thesaurus and not a TV? I am disinclined to concur. I got it last time, it's all yours. (door bangs) - Chicken. If it's Nelly again, I'm telling her to adopt you. Mm, she has a big TV and a streaming service, I'll consider it. Hi. Hey. I'm Chris. Oh, sorry. Here you go. A volunteer handyman? Yep, mostly for new people in the neighborhood. That sounds really nice. It sounds like a scam to me. (chuckles) No scam. I just like to help people. Exactly what a scammer would say. I have references on the card. Anyone can print a little card. How do we know this is really you? Hey Chris. Hey Bob. That was awfully convenient. Is Bob a part of the scam? (chuckles) Do you need help moving stuff in? Nope. Lost everything in a fire. Makes moving real easy. Okay. Well I've got a hot dog waiting for me in the truck. If you do need help in the future, call anytime. Why didn't you eat your hot dog before? I'll be cold now. I like cold hot dogs. That's weird. What was that? I've never seen you be so mean to someone. I'm just being cautious, stranger-danger and all that, like you taught me by the way. For all we know, Chris here could be another Nazi like our neighbor, Autobahn. I think his name is Otto. Chris is pretty cute though, right? Pretty repulsive if you ask me. Oh, so I definitely shouldn't date him if he asks me out? I'm just looking out for you. You're a sucker for a pretty face. Ah-ha, so you admit it, he's cute. I'm going for a walk. Gonna look for wanted posters with Chris's face on them. If you find any, bring me one back. I'll hang it in my room. (Kallie groans) (Kallie groans) (Santa statue thunks) (Kallie sighs) Do you need some help? Oh. That would be wonderful. Thank you. (Otto sighs) (Otto exhales) Here you go. Oh, thank you. I saw the boys that did this. Jake and Peter. This is not the first year they do this. Did you call their parents? Long ago. Did not help then, will not help now. So, (chuckles) they make a mess, I clean it up and so it goes. But... that's not fair My name is Otto. And you are? I'm Kallie. Just moved in next door. Oh, well Kallie... you have heard the saying, "Life is not fair?" I definitely know that one. But you may not have heard is this: "To err is human; "to forgive, divine." Forgiveness frees us from anger, hatred and pain. At my age, I wish to spend my life in as little pain as possible. (both chuckle) So, when the boys err... I forgive. Time to get up sweetheart. Our new lives await! (Kallie groans sleepily) Just five more minutes. Good morning, sunshine. What if I let you pick breakfast? Anything you want, you name it. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Strawberry waffles, hash-browns covered in melted cheese, buttermilk biscuits drowning in butter. That sounds perfect. (cereal clattering) Sorry. Had to get you up somehow. Our buses will be here soon. How you feeling, excited? Mm, more like anxious, restive, high-strung, tense, apprehensive, excitable, fearful, perturbed. I'm hiding that thesaurus. (titters) And what about you? Excited for multiple bus rides to your new job, then more buses after work to the library for four glorious hours of online hacker school? Computer coding school. And I don't have your fancy thesaurus so I am hesitant, doubtful, scared. Sorry, that was too truthful. You're the smartest and bravest person I know. You'll do great. Thank you sweetie, but I'm supposed to be telling you that. You do. Where do you think I got it? [Office Secretary] This is a wonderful school. I really think you're going to enjoy it here, Kallie. The kids are great, they're so welcoming. And you're here at the perfect time of year too. We have so many Christmas programs planned this month. Ah. Kallie, this is Lisa Green. Welcome to Kenville Middle School. Lisa will show you around. She'll take you to your first class. Okay, bye bye. You met my mom Nelly, yesterday. Mom sensed you could use a little extra help so she asked me to take you under my wing, show you around, be your friend, you know, 'cause you're the new kid and like super poor. Mom's really into charity as you already know. So she figured I could help you fit in since I'm kinda like the queen of the school. Right girls? Oh, that's Johanna and Kassiah. - Oh hey... - Come on now. I'll show you around. (gasps) Oh. So there's the cafeteria. I bring macrobiotic lunches from home, so I have no idea if the food here is any good. Oh, but the school does have a free lunch program, so you should make sure your mom signs you up for that. - Oh, I don't really... - And down the hall is ceramics, woodworking and AV classes. I call it Loser Land, kinda self explanatory. Oh, and there's the teacher's lounge, but I'm allowed to use it since my mom's like super in charge of the town and head of the PTA so everyone's kind of scared of her. So if you ever want to like watch TV or take a nap during class, just let me know. Okay. Those are my besties. I'm cheer captain of course. Good morning Binocular Boy. (tree crashes) Can you believe those glasses? You'd think he could see satellites in space with those things, but instead he's constantly running into things. It's hilarious. (Kallie sighs) That's Second-hand Sue. She gets all her clothes donated from charity. Just be glad you're not as poor as her. Oh, there's Mini Mindy. Watch this. (garbage can thuds) (Lisa chuckles) I love this school. That's Diana. She was the new kid before you showed up here. She's just like you, poor and super unlucky. Someone stole her electric wheelchair during the move here. I mean like what's with all the poor people coming here? It's like an invasion. Super weird. (gasps) Speaking of weirdos, did my mom tell you about your neighbor, Otto? He's like an old German man version of Sue. No family, no friends, total loser. Have you ever met Otto? You kidding? I see him taking care of his yard all the time, but I've never actually talked to him. Does anyone talk to him? Why would they? (bus idling) (bus idling) "Dear Kallie: "Seasons greetings, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukkah to you. "You've received the Santa Box, "now here is what to do. "A Christmas Wish I'll grant, just write it on the back. "Please keep it within reason, "a car won't fit in Santa's sack. "Place the note back in the box, "and wait until it's night. "Then put it back where you found it, "and be sure to turn off the light. "Then last but not least, "go directly back to bed. "Do not peek, do not spy, on the jolly man in red. "The Santa Box is special, and must be kept a secret. "Tell your parents if you'd like, "just be sure that they won't leak it. "If you follow these instructions, "your wish will soon come true. "Peace and joy this Christmas season, "from the Santa Box to you." Boy, did you pick the wrong person! (lid thuds) (box clatters) Ed! Ed, he's at it again. (Ed sighs) What's going on? (Ed sighs) How are you not bored with this? Don't you ever wonder what he's doing over there at two in the morning? It's been like 10 years. I think I stopped caring nine and a half of them ago. Why don't you just go over and ask him yourself and end the mystery? Like he'd tell me. Besides you should care if you wanna get your hands on that property he's renting. Donald's already rich and he actually likes Otto. So he's never gonna kick him out so that he can sell us the place, no matter what you offer him. Besides, my investor's moved on like a long time ago. And so should you Nell. Can we please just like go to sleep? Forget investors. I had Ted update the plans. He was able to fit another home on the property layout. That's four. With the current market value, imagine the money that we would be making off this one deal? So this house that we live in has two mortgages on it. So no bank is gonna give us a loan. Do you understand? I've have some dirt on Mindy. She'll make sure the loan goes through. I'm pretty sure that's called extorsion. Honey, we need this deal to go through in order to get out of debt. Do you understand that we're in debt because you spend money like we have a printing machine in our over-mortgaged basement? Imagine. No mortgages. All bills paid for. A college fund for Lisa. You'd rather kick an old man out of his home, than start spending and saving responsibly? Kallie? Hi, it's Sue, right? Yeah. Mr. Anderson assigned me as your lab partner since I didn't have one. Is that okay? Of course. I look forward to blowing up the school with you. Just a joke. Science class? Mixing chemicals and stuff? Sorry, I'm not used to hearing jokes unless they're about me. I'm sorry Sue but, if you're my lab partner, you're gonna hear a lot of terribly unfunny jokes because I get them all from my mom. Our big science project is coming up. We should get together... - There you are. Oh, it's Sue. I thought Kallie was talking to a pile of old laundry someone left in the hallway. We can talk later. Look, it's only been a couple of days so I'll forgive you, but if you're going to be my friend, you can not be caught talking to losers like Sue. Mom, you're exhausted. I told you, I'll make dinner until you're done with online school. I appreciate the thought sweetie, and as much as I love mac and cheese I don't think we can live off it. Hey, I make a mean PB and J too. How did I beat you home? Where have you been? I met my lab partner after school, worked on a science project and then, promise you won't get mad? In the history of anyone asking that question, has anyone ever kept that promise? I was helping our neighbor, Otto. The Nazi neighbor? He's not a Nazi, mom, he's a sweet old man and everyone hates him. There must be a reason. Mom, he has no friends or family. - Kall... - You've always told me to make my own decisions based on actual facts, not gossip. (exhales) Okay fine. But I wanna meet this Otto guy. You think he likes lasagne? (Kallie knocking) Oh. Hello there. You must be Rachel. It's nice to finally meet you. Kallie has told me all about you, but she didn't know if you liked lasagne. Oh, it is one of my very favorites. Sorry, we just moved in, so I don't have a casserole dish yet. Oh no, no, not to worry. Do you need this returned? How pathetic would I sound if I said yes? Not in the least. "Conservation is the heart and soul of economy." Otto has all sorts of cool sayings like that. Oh, your daughter flatters me. I steal them from movies, books and such. Oh, but I, I apologize. I should be bringing you welcome gifts, but I do not drive anymore, so shopping can be... No, don't worry about it. And if you ever need anything, I'm happy to go to the store for you. You are too kind. Oh, are you Jewish? Oh. Why yes, yes I am. Did Nelly make you put up all these Christmas decorations? No, no, not at all. I may not celebrate Christmas like you do, but I love its festive nature, and the good spirit it brings each year. I am sorry, I would invite you in but... I have an aversion to people coming inside my home. It's an old habit from the war, I'm afraid. Oh, no problem, I completely understand. It's close to bedtime anyway, so. It was so nice meeting you, Otto. Lovely meeting you too. And goodnight. - Goodnight. Goodnight now. Oh, and thank you. Ah, of course. There you go. So? What do you think of Otto? (exhales) Okay. He is a charming, sweet old man. He really doesn't have anyone? Nope. And since he can't drive, he's stuck at home, forced to do yard work. Some people love yard work. I heard it was a punishment for murder in some countries. (Rachel laughs) So, can I help him with his yard work after school every once in a while? Why, you murder someone? Mom, I saw kids throwing rocks at his decorations last week. I mean, I hate Christmas but even I wouldn't do that. And the neighbors just stood and watched the kids do it. You can help Otto as long as your homework is done. But if his rule of no people in his house just happens to change for you... Okay, I know. When I'm helping Otto, I feel like I'm helping grandpa, and then I don't miss him as much. I mean, I know I'm extremely pretty, but the real question is, am I too pretty? Like is that even a thing? I don't think so. (engine roaring) Rachel, right? Yeah. You want a ride? (doors banging) I can get those. Doesn't mean you have to. (Rachel sighs) Hey, how's it going, Kallie? I don't mind taking these in. Are they heavy? (exhales) Yeah, extremely. Probably have a hernia. Mm, are hernias fatal? (Chris chuckles) (Chris clearing throat) What is he doing here? Eye candy. You're so gross. If you wanna meet me at the bus stop on grocery day and help haul our food to the house, be my guest. Oh, you know I would. Sweetie, I know! But I'd much rather watch him do it. (Kallie groans) Right here good? Do you need help putting anything away? Or I could fix something? I've got some extra time. - Nope, we're good. Thank you for the ride. If you have some extra time, I'm about to turn some of this stuff into dinner, if you're hungry. Yeah. Um, actually I just remembered I have somewhere to be. Raincheck though? - Yeah. All right. Dinner mom? Really? What? You're making new friends at school, can't I make a new friend? It's been a long time. I thought you'd finally given up on getting Otto kicked out. Because otherwise you've driven a long way to hear me repeat myself. I'm not going to evict Otto. You and that entire town should be ashamed of the way you've treated him. He's a Nazi, Donald. Give it up. You've never even spoken to the man. I know Otto. Aside from him being the kindest and gentlest person I've ever met, he pays his rent on time. He's turned that place into a Garden of Eden. He's probably tripled my property value. Why on earth would I ever want him to leave? Because you really wanna build that condo development. How did you hear about the condo? I'm gonna make this real simple, Donald. If you want the city to sign off on your plans, you'll evict Otto, and you'll sell that property to me at a drastically reduced price. I don't know who you're working with from my organization, but by the time my lawyer is done with both of you... By the time you're done, one of your competitors would've already broken ground. It's simple. You either lose a friend... or a fortune. Choice is yours. No. You've gotta be kidding me. Is it the guilt? Tell you what. Let the town council decide if Otto stays. They say yes, I'll drop it. And you'll leave Otto alone for good? And your condo deal goes through. If you're willing to sign a contract stating as much, you have a deal. You may have turned that whole town against Otto, but I can't possibly imagine they would kick an old man out of his home. Especially during Christmas. Probably right. ♪ O Tannenbaum ♪ ♪ O Tannenbaum ♪ ♪ Wie treu sind deine Blatter ♪ - Hey Otto. - Mm. If you don't drive then where did these all new flowers come from? Come, I show you. (garage door rolling) Could I get arrested as an accomplice for seeing this? (laughs) Nothing nefarious in here, just flowers and vegetables. You have a garage garden? I grow them from seedlings in here, to keep them away from vermin and the elements. Then, when they are strong, I transfer them into the yard. Wow. What's this one? Ah, that is radish. And onions. And this, this is broccoli. You like broccoli? You very quickly learn to love many things when you are young and starving. Even broccoli. Was that from World War II? Yes. But... I do not wish to speak of sad things. I will show you happy things. Oh. This is my favorite. The Purple Snapdragon. Wow. It's beautiful. Yes. She is. Must be a lot of work, though. Oh it is. But, I do it "To please the eye and brighten the way, "of strangers who may pass by someday." Movie quote? Fortune cookie. (both giggle) But everyone around here is so mean to you. Why try brightening their day? I am like a man who fishes. I throw a line of joy out into the world, sometimes I get a bite, sometimes I get bit. But, I keep fishing. One never knows. Small moments created, can bring big changes. Small moments? Imagine you are having a most terrible day. You feel lonely, no-good, unwanted. And then you pass by a yard filled with God's exquisite creations. The beauty, color, and majesty, is just enough to chase the darkness away;, granting a moment's peace, just long enough for you to hear that whispering voice inside that says, you are not alone. You are of worth. You are loved... because... you are mine. Come. I will show you the rest of the garden. Did you order a computer? Mm. Yes, I put it on our gold card. I also decided to buy us a vacation home in Hawaii. Ah, great. But seriously. Someone made a huge mistake. What did the shipping label say? That's the weird part. It had my name, our address, but no packing slip, or return address. It's a $3,000 computer. Our last car cost half that. I'll just call the post office tomorrow at work and have them pick it up. Or, you could just use it so you don't have to spend extra hours on buses and at the library? Otto's a movie streaming fanatic, I'm sure he'd let you use his WiFi. Someone could lose their job over this. No way I'm keeping. But it's yours. Like it was addressed to you and everything. Nobody's gonna get in trouble. Do you know anything about this? I can't believe you sacrificed your Christmas wish for me. Aw, well believe me, if I knew they'd actually go through with it, I would've asked for a TV the size of a truck. Face it kiddo, you are an amazing person. Consider this your gift as well. Well having you home more is my gift. Did you know that I'm the same height as movie stars? So it means I'm technically like kind of the perfect height because everyone wants to be the same height as movie stars are. And like I wouldn't wanna be shorter. No offense, I wouldn't really wanna be your height because then I wouldn't be tall enough... Can I join you? Not if it's going to bring Lisa over here. Don't worry, she went to go lecture the cheer squad. Apparently they weren't peppy enough during the last assembly. (sighs) I'm sorry for not saying anything when Lisa's mean to you. It wouldn't have mattered. She'd still do it, but then you'd be an outcast like me. I promise, I'm not like her. Then why did you wait for Lisa to go, before you came to talk to me? You're totally right. I just don't know what's wrong with me lately. It's fine, I don't blame you for being embarrassed to hang out in public. But it's not fine. I've been so horrible to you. I am so sorry, Sue. Can we still be mad scientists? Can you work on the project after school today? Yeah, but Mr. Anderson wants us to work on it at home. My place is about as nice as my clothes, so we should go to your house. (scoffs) Do you have a couch, chairs, a kitchen table? Well, yeah. Trust me, your place is better. Do you happen to have a TV? (paper scrunching) "In all my years of life "I thought I'd never see the day "when someone with so little "would give their wish away. "So again, I give the Santa Box, "you already know what to do. "But this time think of yourself, "and make a Christmas wish for you." Someone really wants you to have a Christmas wish. Why are they doing this? This whole thing just reminds me of all the bad stuff that happened during Christmas. Those things have nothing to do with Christmas, sweetie. You're missing the whole point. We can't control when bad things happen, but we can control when good things do. You know, most people take a computer for granted, but for me it's an enormous blessing. That's the gift Christmas gives everyone. The chance to change the world for someone that needs a little help. You helped me. Let someone help you. - Come on in. - Thank you. I hope I'm not interrupting anything. Oh, not at all, I'm just making dinner, waiting for Kallie to get home. Perfect. Follow me. Come on. So I passed a yard-sale, and I thought of your starving house and its poor empty tummy. My house is not starving. I fed it a dresser, two mattresses and my daughter. (Chris giggles) You didn't have to do this, but thank you, I'll pay you back. Sorry, that's against the Christmas rules, and you'll invoke the wrath of Santa if you try. The wrath of Santa? I don't know, maybe it was the wreath of Santa? Fine, but you should stay at least for dinner and try them out with us. Kallie's made it pretty clear how she feels about me. Kallie's a doll once you get to know her. The last doll I saw was in a horror movie, and it was killing everyone. Don't worry, you can sit far, far away from her. Table looked a lot bigger in the back of my truck. Isn't this great? We don't have to sit on the floor anymore? So, Kallie, how's that science project going with Sue? Oh, science project, huh? That sounds interesting. What are you building? It's a contraption that can make people disappear. Forever. Oh. That's handy. What is it really? It's a catapult that can fling up to 200 pounds over 100 miles away. How much do you weigh again, Chris? (fork clangs) I'm sorry your daughter loves me more than you. (laughs) She really is the sweetest girl. You just need to come around more so she can get to know you. I'd like that. Thanks again for the early Christmas gift. You didn't happen to buy me a computer, did you? No. But I can keep an eye out for one. Although yard-sale computers are usually glorified doorstops. No, I meant... Never mind. Sorry, forget I said anything. Actually, if you see a couch in the $50 range, just go ahead and buy it, I'll pay you back. At this point as long as it's not infested with something creepy, I'm good. Yeah, I'll keep my eyes peeled. And I'm paying you for it, so don't give me any guff over it. Fine. I'll keep my guff and share none with you. - I'm kidding. - Oh, mom! The toilet's clogged. I need help! (both sigh) - I'm just gonna go. - Yeah. (Rachel giggles) Finally figure out what to ask for? Yep. Will it injure Chris in any way? Darn, I should have thought of that. (Rachel sighs) (Rachel sighs) Hi. Mom. Guess what? - What? Hold that thought. My Santa Box wish came. That was fast, what did you wish for? (locker clangs) (book thuds) [Kallie Voice over] "A season like this, "is for someone like you. "Smart and kind and a friend that is true. "Use this gift card to buy something that's cool. "Like gallons of ice cream, "now I'm starting to drool. "Merry Christmas from 'The Santa Box Elf.'" Christmas curse? These things, they are not curses. My dad, home, car, grandpa, burned apartment? Well, I mean, technically that was Thanksgiving, but it's still Christmas's fault for being a bad influence. (harrumphs) Question. How was your life between all these so called curses? What do you mean? Were you homeless, starving? Begging for scraps of food in the street? Well, no. We've always been happy. I have been through many bad things in my life, but when they were happening I never bothered to stop and check the calendar. Purple Snapdragon, right? Very good. (chuckles) Ah, it was Aglaia's favorite. This is the very flower I gave to her on the day we were married. (giggles) In Greek, Aglaia means beauty or splendor, but she was so much more. I have been grafting the original with new Snapdragon to keep it alive all these years. Aside from my memories, this is my most cherished possession. Aglaia and I had a very good life, but we also had many trials. But the bad times helped us appreciate the good. When I see this flower, those happy memories return, and I feel she is with me. Did you ever get angry? You know, because of all the bad stuff that happened? At who would I direct this anger? You know... God? Oh. How could I be angry at the One who brought Aglaia into my life? You have been through much my young friend, perhaps more than most children your age. But our trials are not only what makes us strong, they also help to guide us. How? The events of my life, good and bad, led me to Aglaia. Your good and bad has led you here, at this very moment in time. Yet, you believe Christmas will not bring you joy, but tragedy? Fine. You are lucky. How could that possibly be lucky? Because you know it is coming. You have time to prepare. Decide right now how you will respond. Will you allow it to make you bitter and angry as you have been in the past? Or will you face the challenge and be brave? Will you allow yourself to grow strong by asking yourself one simple question: What am I meant to learn from all of this? Okay. Everything looks good. I think this will be the biggest and best party I've ever thrown. (people applauding) That is if you can remember to do your job correctly. Now, there is one last thing I would like to discuss before we leave, and that is concerning Otto Nemz. (people groaning) I'm sorry, does anyone have anything that they'd like to say? Well, it's just that you've tried everything to remove Otto, but legally there's nothing we can do. You know, I've been financing this Christmas party for the last 10 years. Maybe I should just let all of you buy all of the gifts for all those poor kids. And pay for catering, decorations, building rentals, insurance, security... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not saying give up. I think I speak for everyone here when I say, if you can find a legal way of getting Otto kicked out, we'll back you. I'm so glad to hear you say that. Shall we put it to a vote? (bell ringing) I feel like sometimes you ought to bring jean jackets, a lot of people have been wearing jean jackets. I mean, like I'm not saying you're copying me. Technically, like you kinda are, you know. Hi Sue, you look amazing! Thanks, early Christmas presents. It's great wearing pants that don't fall down when I sneeze. - You look like a... - It's nice actually knowing the size of clothes I wear. Well done. Doesn't she look great, Lisa? I mean we're still working on the science project after school? Yeah, I'll see you at your place. - I bet those clothes... - Great, see you then. I bet you smell good. As opposed to before. She's gone, the moment's over. Let's go put some lip gloss on you so you can feel better. You should have seen it, Sue looked amazing and Lisa almost blew a gasket! I wish I had a video of her face. (giggles) Are you not afraid that Sue will turn out like Lisa? Nah. Lisa's a brat because of her mom. But Sue only has a dad, and he's a really good guy. They don't have much but they're happy. They sound quite wealthy to me. Oh, are you still coming to our New Home celebration dinner tonight? (chuckles) But of course. Can I bring anything? No. My mom's really excited to be cooking for someone than just me, so there will be lots and lots of food. Plus her new friend Chris will be there. And is this Chris not your friend also? He's nice I guess. I mean, mom's dated before but I've never seen her look at a guy the way she looks at him. That is bad? It's just weird, mom liking someone other than my dad. And he keeps bringing us stuff for Christmas. He just brought a couch and a chair. And... It's like he's trying to replace what we've lost. He can't replace what I've lost. Is he trying to replace? It is Christmas after all and you just told me of a very kind gift that brought joy to your friend Sue. Perhaps this Chris is just trying to bring joy to you and your mother. "It's time to give up, "I know when I'm beat. "With a spirit like yours, "I cannot compete. "And since I can't win, "I'll offer you a deal. "Find those who need wishes, "and I'll make them real. "Help anyone you like, but the same rules apply. "Keep the Santa Box secret, "so you'll have to be sly. "If your mother approves, "and I think that she will, "we'll make lots of folks happy, "Christmas joy they will feel. "The Santa Box." So, can I? Hey time is up, everyone. Relax until class is over, and feel free to bother each other, just leave me alone. Are you okay, Ben? Yeah, it's just allergies. It's not just allergies. Little Benny is sad because his only friend just died. That's horrible, Ben. I'm so sorry. Don't be, it was just an ugly dog. Wait, you have a cat, right? What if your cat killed your dog because he was jealous? (bell rings) (Ben sobbing) Hold on. Why are you home so early? Is it the Christmas curse? Did you get fired? Do we have to move again? No, a water pipe broke and it flooded the office so they sent us home early. Hurry, there's something for you inside. What, okay. It wasn't here when I got home, then I went to check the mail and boom, it was sitting on the porch. Why are you acting so weird? There was a note that told me to look inside. So I looked. Now you, go, go, go. - Okay! (lid clangs) Are those real? I've never seen that many all together before, but yeah. Real. That looks like a lot! It is a lot. Read the note. - Careful. - Okay. It's says for you to read it. "Dear Kallie. "This money is yours to do as you wish. "Your gift of sacrifice has given me hope "for the youth of this time, "and I pray your example "will spread farther and wider in this world "than the darkness that's currently fighting to engulf it. "You have wisely discovered "that it's not about the gift, "but what need that gift fulfills. "But don't forget that sometimes money "or a material object is perfect, "but other times what people need most "is just to know that someone out there cares. "This will be the last time you receive the Santa Box. "Please set it outside tonight "so I can continue my favorite tradition. "Thank you for making my Christmas extra special this year. "Merry Christmas, Kallie. "The Santa Box." What should I do with the money? That's up to you, sweetie. Mom? I need a bus pass. There's something I need to buy. (Ben gasps) Hi. That was amazing. Did you see Ben's little face light up when he saw that puppy? (giggles) Yup, look, still crying. I can see why you love this. Who's next on the list? I don't know. Well, if you need a helpful elf again, you know where to find me. (Kallie exhales) Wait, I got it! Lisa is the answer. If Lisa's the answer, I'm afraid to hear the question. Ugh! Lisa loves making fun of kids for different things. I'm going to use those things to help them. - That's brilliant. - Mm-hmm. Lisa doesn't know it yet, but she's about to help me fill my Santa Box Wish list. (bright music) Hi Binocular Boy. (boy screams) (students cheering) (students applauding) Ugh! I ate way too much. (chuckles) You outdid yourself Rachel. Best meal I have had in many years. Thanks for the complement, you are now invited to Christmas dinner. Oh, well, I would be honored. Thank you. I agree. Dinner was great. Fantastic. Amazing. Delicious. Mesmerizing. Mesmerizing, really? Fine, you're also invited. And thank you for helping with dinner tonight. Mom, he brought cold hot dogs. [Chris And Rachel] They had cheese inside. (Otto chuckles) Where do you normally eat? On Christmas? Phew. Porter's Pizza. That's so sad, I feel like hugging you. I say go with your instincts. (Otto clears throat) (Kallie clears throat) So Otto, when did you start celebrating Christmas? My wife, Aglaia and I, we adopted Christmas many years ago. And while, as Jews, we do not worship Jesus, we recognized that he was an extraordinary man. A good rabbi, a teacher who taught others to be kind, to love one another, and to forgive those who have wronged us. I witnessed the very worst that man can become. He was an example of what man should strive to be. One cannot help but honor, respect and cherish such an amazing person. (students speaking indistinctly) (locker bangs) - Oh. Something is going on. Horrid Tooth Hailee got braces. Apparently she got sick of her crooked smile. Her parents probably had to mortgage their trailer home to get them. Binocular Boy Josh got contacts. Now he can actually see. There goes my entertainment. And you will never believe what Mini Mindy did. Why are you wearing pajamas to school? You look ridiculous. Let me help you out. (Mindy screams) (bin thuds) Yeah, yes. I don't get it. Everyone's so... - Happy? - Yes. It's disgusting. Hey Sue. Today's the day, you're excited? Heck yeah. History is about to be made in science class. (giggles) What are you losers talking about? Mr. Anderson's judging the science projects today. What lame thing did you make? Only the most epic volcano ever. Oh, a volcano. How original. This is no ordinary volcano. It's got smoke, lights and even sound effects. So, we're basically guaranteed victory. It's a huge part of our grade, so we worked super hard on it. I'm going to class, you coming? I'll see you in 8th period after the assembly. We're going to dominate! - Come through. - Hello! (scissors snips) (chuckles) Let's see how epic it is now. (Lisa screams) (students laughing) (students laughing raucously) Girls? We need to talk. You just get along with everybody, don't you? Is this a part of your volunteering charity stuff? Snowmen for widows? Not normally, but everyone else has decorations to show their Christmas spirit, so. Did you not see the smiling Santa hanging on the wall inside? Yes, but that's inside. Out here it's like a corpse factory. No spirit. Now, your neighbor Otto had an orphaned Frosty, so he thought you guys could give him a good home. Frosty doesn't seem to like you much. Yeah, but once he gets to know me, he'll realize I'm a good guy, and that I really care about him. You wanna help with Frosty's mid section? You can't have a snowman without six-pack abs to hold him up. [Kallie] Are you sure you want to make a showman with better abs than yours? [Chris] Hey. That can't possibly be my daughter setting up a Christmas decoration! Hey, I gave into peer pressure. Hey Kallie, when we're done why don't you go and invite Otto for dinner to say thank you for Frosty. You think he'll like my stew? Everyone likes your stew. Do you like stew, Chris? (Kallie knocking) Otto? Hello, there. Is this real? I did not mean for you to see that. They... They can't just kick you out. The owner has decided to sell. Isn't there something we can do? This is Nelly. She's been trying to get you kicked out. It will be all right. If this is what is required, I will comply. You can't just give up. I fear, the law is on their side. That doesn't mean it's hopeless. I came to invite you to dinner. Chris will be there too. Between the four of us, we can definitely figure something out. So, do you think it'll work? It's worth a shot. I have read more rental agreements than I care to remember. A landlord has to give you longer than a week to move out. At the very least, an attorney will get you more time to figure things out. And Otto, if you need money or help with the attorney, I know someone who can help with that. You are all so kind. Between this wonderful meal and your friendship, I feel much better. (chuckles) By the way, you are all going to the big Christmas Party, yes? No way. It's Nelly's party. (sighs) But this party, it is so much more than Nelly. Many people work hard on this party. Many children receive gifts from Santa. For some, I'm afraid that is all they will receive. Do not let one person spoil the Christmas spirit you have allowed back into your heart. It's up to you, but I'm going. You'd really leave me and go alone? (Chris clears throat) Technically she wouldn't be going alone. And I was just starting to like you. Please, Kallie. Promise me you will go. It would mean so very much to me. Fine. I promise. But if Nelly talks to me, I might do something that might get me in even more trouble than I am at school. (Kallie gulps) I'll walk Otto home, then we should probably talk. Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. Uh-uh. Come on Otto. Goodnight, and thank you again. - Goodnight Otto. - Goodnight Otto. So, this revenge you and Sue play on Lisa, it made you feel better, yes? When I saw the humiliated look on Lisa's face, I felt like crying. I don't get it! Lisa's rich, popular, beautiful. (sighs) Why did Sue and I feel so bad for her? But when Lisa was mean to the other kids, you do nothing at first, yes? I mean, it was nice having popular friends. I didn't wanna give that up. But, then you give up popularity to play this joke on Lisa as a way to come to Sue's defense, yes? Uh-uh. So... Who came to Lisa's defense when she was standing there, humiliated? No one. Everyone just laughed. Interesting. For such a popular girl, is that not strange? I never though about it like that. But yeah. I have lived across from Lisa most of her life. I have seen much. You and Sue felt bad because... for one brief moment, you saw the real Lisa. A girl who feels lonely. Worthless. Unloved. Sometimes, our enemies are only our enemies until we truly get to know them. What's that from? My life. (metal clangs) Can you save it? I'm so, so sorry, Otto! Okay. How is he? Well, the procedure went well. The stent restored the blood flow to his heart but, unfortunately, Otto hasn't regained consciousness yet. We're not exactly sure why. There is a chance that a blood clot may have formed and traveled to his brain. If that is the case... The chances of Otto of waking up are pretty slim. But the odds of him waking up without debilitating brain damage... You all right, sweetie? No, mom, I'm not all right. I finally allowed myself to believe that the Christmas curse was gone, that it was done, but I was wrong, and it's all my fault. You know that's not true. Yes it is. I saw the Santa Box in Otto's living room. It was him the whole time. He's lived here for 10 years, perfectly happy. Then he gives me the Santa Box. And now he's getting evicted, his garden is ruined, his wife's flower is destroyed, and now he's in the hospital, dying. This is why I hate Christmas. Nothing ever happens to me, it's the people I love that suffer. Dad, you, grandpa... and now Otto. You better think twice before coming back here for Christmas next year. Does that mean you care about me? (Santa picture ripping) (Santa picture thunks) Morning sweetie. What's wrong? Is Otto okay? (exhales) I just called, but no changes unfortunately. How are you? I don't know. Maybe the Christmas party will cheer you up? Even if I didn't hate Christmas more than ever, how could I go to the Christmas party with Otto dying in the hospital? I have something to tell you. I help Otto with the Santa Box. You? My mom died when I was 10. My dad was a drunk. Life was hard. And then the Santa Box showed up. What did you wish for? A family. I got my wish too. Child services showed up one day and eventually I was adopted by an amazing family. I don't know where I'd be without this little box. Years later I found out it was Otto, and we've been friends ever since. He gives me the money and the Santa Box list, and I buy all the stuff and deliver it. He calls me his Elf. Geez, he got you a family. I just got everybody gift cards and stuff. Hey. Don't do that. Don't diminish what you did for those kids. You gave exactly what they needed, when they needed it. Take it from somebody who's been on the other side of it; you have no idea what that meant to them. You should be proud. I am. And I know your mom is. And Otto is amazed by you. Why didn't he just tell me? He's got his reasons. And he swore me to secrecy, but under the current circumstances I think it's time for all of Otto's secrets to come out. All? He has more? Yeah. And one I didn't even know about until today. Otto's pretty much sold everything he owns in order to keep funding the Santa Box. I'm sorry, I still can't go. Would you like to know why Christmas means So much to Otto? It's because this little box saved his life. How did it save his life? Well, I guess you're gonna have to come to the Christmas party to find out. I'll tell you on the way. (people speaking indistinctly) The gifts have still not arrived! Parents and dozens of excited kids are asking me where Santa is. I just talked to Santa, he's running a little late. Everything is fine. Okay, I'm sorry, it's just the little kids... The kids, kids, kids. The party just started, tell everyone to chill. Then tell their parents that the snot-nosed kids are getting free toys, so maybe they shouldn't complain about having to wait. Great party as always. Thank your mother for us. Merry Christmas Lisa. Tell your mom the party is amazing. Have you seen Johanna and Kassiah? They're an hour late. ♪ Silent night ♪ ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm ♪ ♪ All is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ ♪ Mother and child ♪ - Lisa? Don't bother begging to be my friend again. I only hung out with you because my mom made me. You're a loser, just like the others. I came to apologize. Instead of playing a joke on you, I should have just been honest and talked to you. Talked about what? Why you act the way you do. Me, there's nothing wrong with me, you're the loser who... - Just stop it, Lisa. (exhales) You tease certain kids. You call them cruel names, isolate them. You make them feel bad because that's how you feel all the time. You just barely moved here, don't act like you know me. You're right, I don't know you. Not the real you anyway. But that's the Lisa I want to be friends with. And I don't care if you're rich or popular or pretty. But I do care if you're sad, or if you're lonely, or just need somebody to talk to. I care because I'm a good friend. And I hope to be yours someday. ♪ Christ the Savior is born ♪ (audience applauding) What do you think you're doing? You didn't tell me you were gonna sing. I didn't even know you could sing. You were supposed to meet me an hour ago. I've been walking around here by myself like a loser. Well? (scoffs) Oh. You mean we actually get to talk for once? - Well, you didn't... - Not that you would notice, or would even care, but we started taking singing lessons. Someone anonymously encouraged us to develop our talents, so we gave it a try and we're actually good. Good enough that we were asked to sing tonight, although we assume it wasn't your mom who requested us. But we will need to practice more, So we're no longer your tag-a-longs. Singing's more important than money. Money, what are you talking about? Your mom, she pays kids to be your friend. Why else would everyone put up with you? That's not true. (guffaws) Aw! You actually think people like you? (Nelly exhales) So, is Santa coming or what? I can't get a hold of the guy. Well, who is he? Why don't we just go to him and pick up the gifts? I don't know who he is. How do you not know who he is? You like literally use him every single year. Hi, sorry to interrupt the party, but I have some bad news. Santa's not coming because he's in the hospital. Don't worry kids, not the real Santa. Just one of his helpers who's been playing Santa at these parties for the past nine years. His name is Otto Nemz. You all know Otto, he's the 80-year-old man your town council recently evicted, just so Nelly Green could buy the property. I'm putting a stop to this. Nell. Let her finish. Please. You never bothered to get to know Otto, so let me tell you about my friend. (speaking in a foreign language) (rifle thunks) (box clattering) (tins clatter) The boy was Otto. For six months Klaus brought food, water and did his best to bring whatever Otto wrote on the papers. A blanket, medicine, and even a toy for Christmas. This is the box that Klaus used to save Otto's life all those years ago. When I first moved here with my mom, I hated Christmas. Otto used this to teach me what Christmas is really about. It's a time to forget ourselves and think of others. He and his wife used their fortune to fund the Santa Box. But when the money ran out, Otto started secretly selling his antiques and everything he owned, online, all so he could continue his favorite tradition, and more. (audience applauding) (audience cheering) He's also been buying your Christmas gifts for all these years. To be fair, Nelly had no idea, since Otto wanted to remain anonymous. Otto looked forward to this party every single year, and while he may not be with us here in person, the spirit of Christmas that he loves so much, is... (audience applauding) Merry Christmas. If you'd like to say goodbye, it's time. Thank you for opening her heart. You never got to thank Klaus. But I got to thank you every day. Goodbye, my friend. We'll be in the hall, okay sweetie. I kept my promise. I went to the Christmas party. It was fun. Though... I kinda told everyone your secret, but blame Chris, 'cause he's the one who told me. I remembered what you told me. And... I'm choosing to stay strong. And I asked myself the question: what am I supposed to learn from all this? And I think I finally know. I learned that friendship is more important than popularity. That forgiveness is more powerful than revenge. And that Christmas is the best time to spend with the ones you love, even if bad things are happening at the time. But I still want to make memories with you. I'm sorry for being so angry for so long. But I'm not anymore. Otto helped me to understand. He had a right to be angry, but he never was. But, if it's okay will you please, please tell him that he has a family here on Earth too? I couldn't find a Purple Snapdragon, so I picked the one I thought you'd like most. But I don't know it's name. But you'll tell me... when you wake up. You'll tell me. Goodbye, Otto. Tolumnia bahamensis. My second favorite flower. Otto! Thank you. - So, you are happy now? - Mm. No more of this Christmas curse nonsense, yes? Totally done, I promise. Good. (chuckles) Very good. Maybe I spoke too soon. I'm so glad you're all right, Otto. Good to see you my friend. Well, that's the problem. I haven't been a very good friend. I made a mistake that almost cost you your home. Almost? Does that mean that Otto's not evicted? This is Nelly's purchase agreement. It seems she had a sudden change of heart. Everyone's real sorry, Otto. Well, that is all in the past. (chuckles) Besides, it's Christmas Eve, who could have bad feelings at such a time as this? (Otto gasps) Hey, Otto. The town council wanted to wish you a Merry Christmas. You are so kind. (Otto gasps) This is wonderful. What are the speed limits in town these days? (everybody laughs) We've got another surprise for you, Otto. Wow, the snow looks real. Show? What snow? It hasn't snowed here in decades Huh, better late than never. And now that your home is no longer empty, maybe people can come inside and visit you once in a while. Oh, yes. Yes, as the saying goes, "No time like the present." Please, come in my friends. Come. Everyone decided to throw you a Santa Box party. Half the town have stories that they wanna share with you about how the Santa Box helped them in their time of need. Oh, I was not alone in this work. Without the help of my Elf, Chris, I could never have continued. I think you should promote your Elf to Santa, then you can enjoy the party for once. That is a wonderful idea. What say you, Chris? As long as I don't have to wear green tights anymore, I'm in. (both laugh) Green tights? I'm sorry I missed that. Oh, trust me, you are hot. (all laugh) Here, you do the honors. (all laugh) [Kallie Voice over] Dozens of families shared their Santa Box stories with Otto. And he was so happy when they told him they had plans to make Santa Boxes of their own. Hi. I'm Lisa. Kallie. Nice to meet you, Lisa. [Kallie Voice over] And while I didn't get a TV for Christmas, I got something even better. A new home. New friends. And maybe... Even a new family. Oh, would you look at that. We just happened to stop under the mistletoe. It's like fate wants us to kiss. Have I ever told you that fate is my middle name? [Otto] Thank you for coming, my friends. Merry Christmas. Come back again soon. [Kallie Voice over] My name is Kallie Watts, and I love Christmas. In fact... it's my favorite time of year.
