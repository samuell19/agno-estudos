Upon my word, you're The strangest pair of creatures! You jade! What are your after? For me, nothing. For whom, then? For you. For us? For you: Are you women or not? What do you mean? So you should behave like women. And how is that? Treat love lightly. Never neglect an opportunity; Change at the right moment, Sometimes be constant, Flirt with charm, foresee the misfortune so common to those who trust in men, Have your cake and eat it too. And then? And then? Bless us, get on with it. What do we do? Whatever you like. Are you flesh and blood, Or what? At fifteen a woman Should know the ways of the world, Where the devil keeps his tail, What's right and what is wrong. She should know the wiles That ensnare lovers, How to feign laughter or tears And to make up good excuses. At one and the same moment She must listen to a hundred But speak with her eyes to a thousand, Hold out hope to all, Be they handsome or plain, Know how to hide things Without getting flustered, Know how to tell lies Without ever blushing. And, like a queen On her lofty throne, Get her own way With ?I can? and ?I will? It seems they're taking To this doctrine; Hooray for Despina, She knows how to do it. At one and the same moment She must listen to a hundred But speak with her eyes to a thousand, Hold out hope to all, Be they handsome or plain, Know how to hide things Without getting flustered, Know how to tell lies Without ever blushing. And, like a queen On her lofty throne, Get her own way With ?I can? and ?I will? It seems they're taking To this doctrine; Hooray for Despina, She knows how to do it. Sister, what do you say? I'm dumbfounded At the fiendish ideas of that girl. Believe me, she's crazy. Do you think we could possibly Follow her counsel? Of course, if you stood everything Upside down. On the contrary, I'm standing things The right way up: Don't you think it wrong for two young women who are betrothed to do such things? She's not saying We should do any harm. It's bad enough getting ourselves talked about! But if it's said they've come to see Despina! Your conscience is too elastic! What will our menfolk say? Nothing; Either they'll not know about it And it's over and done with, Or they'll hear something, And then we'll say they came to see her. But our hearts? Will stay as they are; To amuse ourselves a little and not to die of boredom Is not to be false, my dear sister. That's true. So? So you go ahead: But I don't want to be involved If there should be a scandal. How can there be a scandal When we're taking such precautions? However, listen, let's come to an agreement: Which of these two Narcissi do you fancy for yourself? You choose, sister. I've already chosen. I'll take the dark one, Who seems to me more fun. And meantime I'll laugh And joke a bit with the fair one. Playfully I'll answer his sweet words. Sighing, I'll imitate The other's sighs He'll say to me: "My love, I'm dying!" He'll say to me: "My dearest treasure!" And meanwhile what sport and pleasure I shall have! I'll take the dark one, And meantime I'll laugh Who seems to me more fun. And joke a bit with the fair one. Playfully I'll answer His sweet words. Sighing, I'll imitate The other's sighs. He'll say to me: "My love, I'm dying!" He'll say to me: "My dearest treasure!" And meanwhile What sport and pleasure I shall have! Come, make haste to the garden, Dear young ladies! What fun! What music! Such singing! What a brilliant sight! What magic! Come along, quickly! Whatever's going on? You'll soon see. Ye friendly breezes, Help, o help my desires And carry my sighs To the goddess of my heart. You, who thousand times Have heard the tenor of my griefs, Repeat all that you have heard to my beloved. Ye friendly breezes, Help the longings of their dear hearts. What is this masquerade? Come now, courage! Have you lost your tongues? I tremble and quake From head to foot. Love binds the limbs of a true lover. Give them a word of encouragement. Speak then. Say frankly what it is you want. My lady! Rather, my ladies! You do the talking. No, no, you do it. The devil take it! Do stop this absurd Old fashioned nonsense. Despina, let's get this over; You act for one side while I act for the other. Give me your hand, And come this way a little. If you won't speak, I'll speak up for you. A trembling slave Implores your pardon; He offended you, he sees, Though only for a moment; Now he repents in silence... in silence... Now he leaves you in peace in peace He can't do what he wants to, He would do what he can. He can't do what he wants to, He would do what he can. Now come, give them an answer; You just look on and laugh? I'll give them an answer for you. What's done is done. Least said, soonest mended. So let the knot, the sign of servitude, be broken. Give me your arm, And sigh no more. Let's go, for mercy's sake; We'll watch what they will do. I'll rank them higher than the devil If they don't give way now. Oh, what a lovely day! Perhaps a trifle hot. What pretty bushes! Yes, yes, very pretty; They've more leaves than fruit. How charming these paths are! Shall we take a stroll? Your slightest wish Is my command. You are too kind! This is the big moment! What did you say? Er... I told him To keep her entertained. Let us go for a stroll too. Just as you please. Oh dear! What's the matter? I feel so bad, my dearest one, That I think I'm going to die. Oh, don't do that. I'm dying, cruel one, and you mock me? I mock you? "Then give me, light of my life, Some token of your pity." Then give me, light of my life, Some token of your pity. Two, if you like. Tell me what you'd have, and we'll see. Is she joking or in earnest? Deign to accept This humble offering. A heart? A heart. Yes, a heart; the symbol of that one Which burns, pines and longs for you. What a precious gift! Will you accept it? Cruel man, Do not seek to tempt a faithful heart. The mountain is weakening. I don't like this, but I've pledged My honour as a soldier. I adore you! I beg of you! I am all yours! O Heavens! Give in, my dear one! You'll drive me to my death! We'll die together then, My hope and love. Will you accept it? I accept. Poor Ferrando! Oh what joy! This heart I give you, My adored one; But I want yours in return; Come, give it to me. You've given it and I take it, But mine I cannot give; In vain you ask it of me, It is no longer mine. If you no longer own it, Why does it beat here? If you gave me it, What is still beating there? It is my own dear heart That is no longer mine; It's come to lodge with you, And that's what's beating so. Let me put it here. It can't go there. I understand, you little rogue What are you doing? You're not to look. I feel I have A volcano in my bosom! Poor Ferrando, it doesn't seem possible! It feels like I have Vesuvius in my breast! Poor Ferrando, it doesn't seem possible! Now turn your pretty eyes on me. What do you want? See, doesn't that look better? Oh, happy exchange of hearts and affections! What new delights! What sweet pain! Oh, happy exchange of hearts and affections! What new delights! What sweet pain! Unkind one! Why do you fly me? I've seen an asp, A hydra, a basilisk! Ah, cruel one, I understand you! The asp, the hydra, the basilisk And all that's fiercest in the Libyan desert You see in me alone. Ah yes, it's true! You would rob me of my peace. Only to make you happy. Molest me no further. I don't ask you.. Leave me! How can I, until you turn on me An eye less haughty? O Heaven! But you condemn me to death.. He is going... Listen! Oh no, let him go! Let my sight be free of the unlucky object Of my weakness. To what a pass this cruel man has brought me! This is a just reward for my sins! Was this the time For me to heed the sighs of a new lover, to make sport Of another's sighs? Ah, rightly you condemn this heart, o just love! I burn, and my ardour is no longer The outcome of a virtuous love: It is madness, anguish, remorse, repentance Fickleness, deceit and betrayal! In pity's name, my dearest, forgive The misdeed of a loving soul; Oh God, it shall evermore be hidden Among these shady bushes. My courage, my constancy Will drive away this dishonourable desir And banish the memory Which fills me with shame and horror. Have mercy, my love, and forgive the error of this loving soul.. In these shadows, amongst these flowers.. it shall remain forever hidden, o heavens! And who is it whom This unworthy heart has betrayed? Dear heart, your trust deserved A better reward! In pity's name, my dearest, forgive The misdeed of a loving soul; Oh God, it shall evermore be hidden Among these shady bushes. My courage, my constancy Will drive away this dishonourable desire And banish the memory Which fills me with shame and horror. And who is it whom This unworthy heart has betrayed? Dear heart, your trust deserved A better reward! We've won, my boy! Two of a kind? A straight flush! Fiordiligi is modesty incarnate. Good for you, good for me, Good for my Penelope! Let me embrace you for your happy tidings, my faithful Mercury! And my Dorabella, How did she behave? Oh, I haven't a doubt of her. I know so well her sensitive soul. Well, just between ourselves, If you had a doubt It might not be such a bad thing. What? Did she perhaps fall for your flatteries? But no, you're making sport of me; She loves me, adores me alone. Certainly! And so in proof of her love and devotion She gave me this little picture My portrait! The traitress! Where are you going? To tear her heart from her wicked bosom And avenge the betrayal of my love. Stop. Let me go! Are you mad? Would you ruin yourself for a worthless woman? I wouldn't want him to commit some folly! Ye gods! All those promises, And tears, and sighs, and vows How could the inhuman creature Forget them so soon? I'm sure I don't know. What should I do now? To what course, What plan apply myself? Take pity on me, give me your counsel. My friend, I don't know how to advise you. Cruel and heartless woman! In one day! In a few hours! It's certainly something to wonder at. Ladies, you treat so many thus That, if I must speak the truth, I begin to sympathise When your lovers complain. I adore the women, you know, Everyone knows it; Each day I show it And always take your part. But such treatment of so many Discourages me, in truth. A thousand times I've drawn my sword To defend your honour. A thousand times I've championed you With my tongue and, still more, with my heart. But such treatment of so many Is pernicious and a bore. You're attractive, you are charming, Heaven has given you treasures galore And graces envelop you From head to foot. From head to foot. But thus you treat so many, That it's difficult to believe, I adore the women, I show it to you A thousand times I took your part. And graces envelop you from head to foot. But.. But thus you treat so many, That it's difficult to believe, And if your lovers complain They have good reason indeed In what fierce strife, In what confusion Of thoughts and affections I find myself! So unusual and novel is my situation That neither others nor I myself Suffice to give me counsel... oh, Alfonso, How you must be laughing at my stupidity! But I'll have my revenge. I'll banish The traitress from my mind... Banish her? O Heaven, too loudly my heart intercedes for her Betrayed and scorned By her faithless heart, I still know that my soul adores her, I still hear the voice of love for her. Betrayed and scorned, By her faithless heart, I still know that my soul adores her, I still hear the voice of love for her. Bravo! Bravo, that's true fidelity. Get away, you tormentor. It's through you I'm suffering. Come, if you're sensible Your old calm will return. Listen: Fiordiligi has remained Faithful to Guglielmo, But Dorabella's unfaithful to you. To my shame! Dear friend, one must make distinctions in everything. Do you imagine a woman could fail a Guglielmo? Speaking in all modesty,make a small comparison between us... You see, my friend, There's a little extra something... That's just what I think. So meantime you can pay me Those fifty sequins. Willingly. But before I do so, I'd like us To try another experiment. What's that? Have patience; until tomorrow You are both at my command; You gave me your words as soldiers To do what I said. Come, I hope to show you how foolish it is To count your chickens before they're hatched Now I can see You're a woman of sense. In vain, Despina, I tried to resist: That little devil has such tricks, Such eloquence, such a way with him, That he'd melt the heart of a stone. Saints above! That's really something! But here's your sister. What a face she's pulling! You wretches! See what a state I'm in, and all through you! What's the matter, My poor madame? Is something wrong, sister? The devil's in me; let him take me, You two, Don Alfonso, the strangers And all the other fools in the world. Have you lost your senses? Worse, much worse. Recail from me: I'm in love, And my love isn't just for Guglielmo. That's better, much better! Well, I'd like to know how one can Change one's affections in a single day. What a silly question! We are women, And how have you behaved? I can control myself. You don't know anything! You can't, I bet.I'll show you. Believe me, sister, you'd best give in. Love is a little thief, A little serpent is he. According to his whim The heart finds peace or no. Scarcely does he open a path Between your eyes and your bosom Than he chains your soul And takes away your liberty Love's a little thief, a little serpent is he. According to his whim The heart finds peace or no. He'll bring sweetness and content, If you give him his way, But will make your lot heavy If you try to deny him. Love's a little thief, a little serpent is Love. He brings peace to our hearts or takes it away,on a whim. If he visits your breast And plucks at you there, Do all that he asks, As I'll do myself. As I'll do myself. Despina! Despina! What is it? Take this key, and without any questions Or any back answers, Go to the wardrobe and bring me here Two swords, two helmets and two tunics of our lovers. What do you want with them? Go on, and no back answers. Milady's on her high horse! To the battlefield! No other way is left For us to preserve our honour. Go on, don't be afraid. Here I am! Send a servant at once To order six post horses; Tell Dorabella that I wish to speak to her. It shall be done. I think she's out of her mind. How it transforms my whole appearance! I can hardly recognise myself! Very soon now I'll be enfolded In the embraces of my true love; Unrecognised in these garments I will come before him. Oh, what joy will fill his heart When he sees me again! And meanwhile I, left wretched, Shall die of grief. What do I see? I am betrayed! Leave me! Ah no, dear heart! With this sword in your hand Strike me to the heart, And if you lack the strength, By Heaven, I'll guide your hand myself. Get up, I beg! It cannot be. In pity's name, what do you ask of me? Your heart or my death. My strength is giving out! Yield, my dearest! Heaven, direct me! Turn a merciful eye on me. In me alone you'll find Husband, lover and more, if you wish. Delay no longer, my adored one. Merciful heaven! Cruel man, you've won! Do with me what you will. Embrace me, oh, my dearest. And may the consolation for our sorrows Be to spend our time in sweet affection, And sigh for joy! Alas, poor me, what have I seen! What have I heard! Keep quiet, for heaven's sake! I'll pluck out my beard, I'll tear my flesh, And charge the stars with my horns! So that was Fiordiligi, my Penelope,The chaste Diana of the age! Strumpet, Assassin, cheat, swindler, bitch! Let him get it off his chest. Well? Where is she? Who? Your Fiordiligi? - My Fior..(flower) The devil's flower. My Fior... Strangle first her and then me! You see now; There are distinctions in everything; "There's a little extra something " Stop it! Stop taunting me, And instead let's find a way Of punishing them soundly. I know what to do: marry them. I'd rather marry Charon's boat! Vulcan's smithy. The gates of hell. Then you'll stay bachelors for ever. Are there no women Fit for men like us? There's not so many. But what would they do, if these act like this? At bottom, you still love these plucked birds. Unfortunately! Then take them as they are. In the meantime, listen to this eight-line stanza. You'd do well to learn in by heart. Everyone blames women, but I forgive them If they change their love A thousand times a day; Some call it a sin, others a habit, But I say it's a necessity of their heart. The lover who finds that he's been deceived Should blame not others But his own mistake; ..Whether they're young or old, fair or plain ? Repeat with me: all women behave like this! "Cosi fan tutte" all women behave like this! Be quick about it, friends, Light the candles And prepare the table In style for the nobility. The marriage of our mistresses Is already arranged, And you must take your places As soon as the bridegrooms appear. Be quick, dear friends, light the candles And prepare the table In style for the nobility. Well done! Splendid! What abundance! What elegance! You'll all be given a suitable reward. Now the two couples are arriving; Applaud them as they enter: Let cheerful song and merry music Fill the air with gaiety. A prettier piece of comedy There never was, nor ever will be! Blessed be the two bridegrooms And their lovely brides! And their lovely brides! And their loving brides! May a kindly heaven smile on them, And, in the way that birds are, May they be prolific Of progeny to equal them in beauty. Everything now, my dearest, Accords with my desires. Joy grows and spreads Throughout my veins. You are so beautiful! You are so handsome! What lovely eyes! What an attractive mouth! Clink glasses and drink! Drink!Clink! In your glass and mine May every care be drowned, And let no memory of the past remain in our hearts. Would that they were drinking poison, The dishonourable jades! Everything is ready, friends; The notary is coming up the stairs With the marriage contract And ipso facto he'll be here. Splendid! Let him in at once! I'll go and call him. Here he is. Wishing you every happiness, The notary Beccavivi Comes to you with his usual Notarial dignity. And first coughing, Then sitting down, In a clear voice he will read The stipulated contract with the normal provisions In judicial form. Excellent, in truth! By this contract drawn up by me, The following are joined in matrimony; Fiordiligi with Sempronio, And with Tizio Dorabella, Her legitimate sister; The ladies, natives of Ferrara, The gentlemen, Albanian nobles. And in dowry and settlement... We know all that! We believe you! We trust you! Give it here, and we'll sign. Well done! A soldier's life for me! Every day a change of scene; Plenty today and little tomorrow, Now on land and now on sea. What's that noise? What's that singing? Keep quiet: I'll go and see. Mercy on us! God in heaven! Disaster is upon us! I tremble! My blood runs cold! Your former lovers... My former lover... are now disembarking on the shore! What do I hear? Ye cruel stars! What's to be done At this dire moment? Suppose they see us (them)? Conceal yourselves, For pity's sake! Gods, help us! What can we do? Keep calm. Who will save us From this peril? A thousand cruel thoughts Are tormenting my heart; If they discover the deception, whatever will become of us? Safe and sound, exulting with joy, We return to the loving embrace Of our faithful sweethearts To crown them for their constancy! Great heaven! Guglielmo! Ferrando! What joy! You here? How and when? Recalled by royal countermand, Our hearts full of contentment and joy, We've returned to our adorable sweethearts we return to your friendship. But why this pallor, this silence? Why is my love so sad? Their tongues are tied With confusion and overwhelming joy. My tongue has forsaken me; If I don't die it will be a miracle Allow me to have This trunk brought into that room. Heavens, what do I see! A man hidden here! A notary! What's he doing here? No, sit, it's not a notary: It's Despina in fancy dress Who's just back from a ball And come in here to change. Despina? Despina? I don't begin to understand. Could so clever a rogue ever be found? Could they ever find anyone as smart as me? What are these papers? A marriage contract? A marriage contract! Merciful heaven! You've signed here, Don't try to deny it! Treachery! Let us find the villains And their blood shall flow In torrents, rivers, oceans! Ah, my love, my sin is mortal And death alone I seek now; Too late I see my error; With your sword pierce this bosom That deserves no pity! What happened? Let them speak for us, That pander and that procuress! Too true is what she says, And the proof is shut in there! I freeze, I shiver with fright; Why did he give them away? Lovely lady, A noble of Albania bows before you! The miniature exchanged for the little heart I return herewith, Madame! And to the magnetic doctor I give the honour Which he merited! Heavens! What do I see? They're stupefied! I cannot bear this torment! They're half crazy! There's the cruel man who deceived us! I deceived you, but my deception Undeceived your lovers, Who henceforth will be wiser And will do as I wish. Give me your hands, now you're united. Embrace each other and say no more. All four of you can laugh now As I have laughed and shall do again. My love, if this is true, with fidelity and with love I will make good what I have done And adore you evermore. I believe you, my fair one, But I won't put it to the test. I don't know if I'm awake or dreaming, I'm confused, I feel ashamed; Happy is the man who looks At everything on the right side I believe it, my sweet joy, but I don't want to put it to the test! Happy is the man who looks At everything on the right side And through trials and tribulations Makes reason his guide. What always makes another weep Will be for him a cause of mirth And amid the tempests of this world He will find sweet peace.
