MAYBE IT WAS MEAN ROTTEN, BUT IT WASN'T ACCIDENTAL. FORTUNATELY, I'M GETTING OUT OF THE ARMY SOON. I'M GOING TO BE A CIVILIAN, SO NEVER AGAIN CAN THEY ORDER ME TO ASSOCIATE WITH YOU. WHAT'S MORE, I'M GOING BACK TO HEIDELBERG BY TRAIN. YOU CAN GET SOME OTHER CHUMP TO TORTURE IN THAT LUNATIC SIDECAR OF YOURS. AW, HENRI, I KNOW WHY YOU'RE MAD, AND I DON'T BLAME YOU. I WOULD BE TOO. I KNEW IT WAS YOUR LAST JOB IN THE ARMY, AND I JUST DIDN'T THINK. I SPOILED IT FOR YOU. I'D GIVE ANYTHING IF I HADN'T. I'D CUT OFF MY ARM, ALMOST. MM-HMM. OH, I LIKE YOU, HENRI. I CAN'T HELP IT.

I'VE NEVER BEEN KISSED BY A FRENCHMAN. WELL, THERE'S NOT-- WHAT'S SO STRANGE ABOUT THAT? OH, YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY. OH, THAT'S NONSENSE. WELL, YOU JUST HEAR PEOPLE TALK. WE'RE NO DIFFERENT THAN ANYBODY ELSE. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. I'VE JUST HEARD TALK. THAT'S SILLY. WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT JUST ONCE, AND LET ME SEE? OH, CATHERINE! THAT'S THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT, ISN'T IT? BUT I TELL YOU, IT'S SO SILLY. WELL, THERE'S NO HARM IN TRYING, IS THERE? NO. I SUPPOSE NOT. WELL, ALL RIGHT. GO AHEAD. HMM. WELL, ARE YOU READY? SURE. THERE. YOU SEE? THAT WAS NO GOOD.

YOU SEE, HENRI WAS ON THE MOTORCYCLE, AND I-- CATHERINE, I DON'T THINK THE MAJOR WOULD BE INTERESTED IN ALL THE DETAILS. AND YOU TWO DIDN'T WANT TO GO AWAY TOGETHER. IT WOULD SEEM YOUR MISSION WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. THANK YOU, MAJOR. MY CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE THE VERY FIRST TO KNOW. I GUESSED AS MUCH. NOW, AS TO GETTING MARRIED, THERE'S ONE HITCH. ITCH? IT'S PROBABLY THE HAYSTACK. HENRI AND I-- I DON'T-- I DON'T-- I SAID "HITCH." ALL MARRIAGES BETWEEN AMERICAN MILITARY PERSONNEL AND ALIENS-- AND YOU COME UNDER THAT HEADING, CAPTAIN-- AH. MUST BE APPROVED BY THE COMMANDING GENERAL. NOW, THERE'S A SET PROCEDURE FOR THAT KIND OF THING. YES, BUT-- IT'S ONLY RED TAPE, HENRI. WELL, DO YOU ITCH, CATHERINE? THE MAJOR SAID "HITCH," HENRI. SHE MEANS WE'VE GOT TO GET A LOT OF THINGS APPROVED. OH. HERE ARE THE FORMS REQUESTING PERMISSION TO MARRY. FILL THEM OUT IN QUADRUPLICATE, AND WHEN YOU'VE COMPLETED THEM, SEND THEM TO COLONEL BLIVEN'S OFFICE. YES, MAJOR. AND GOOD LUCK. GOOD-BYE, CAPTAIN. YES. IS SHE ALWAYS SO CONFUSING? NO. BUT THIS IS GOING TO BE. WHAT'S THE MATTER? LOOK AT ALL THIS STUFF WE'VE GOT TO FILL OUT. SHE SAID THERE WAS FOUR OF THEM. YOU WEREN'T HEARING SO GOOD. SHE SAID FOUR OF EACH. LET'S GO AND GET TO WORK. FINE. WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT. WAIT. SOUVENIR. YOU'LL END UP WITH A POCKETFUL. WELL, THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. DON'T GIVE UP NOW. WE'RE HALFWAY THROUGH.

WE'LL NEVER GET THIS DONE. AND LOOK AT THIS SILLY THING. "NAME YOUR FATHER'S GENDER." NO. YEAH. IT SAYS SO. LOOK. NO. "FATHER'S BIRTHPLACE." GENDER BELONGS TO THIS QUESTION OVER HERE. I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG. WHAT AN IDIOT. WERE YOU EVER CAPTURED BY PERUVIAN INDIANS? NO. WHY? I UNDERSTAND THEY DO A VERY GOOD JOB OF SHRINKING HEADS. MMM. COME ON. COME ON. LET'S TAKE TIME OUT. OH, THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS I'D RATHER DO THAN ANSWER QUESTIONS. THIS, FOR INSTANCE? MM-HMM. MAYBE I'D BETTER GO BACK AND SEE ANOTHER DOUBLE FEATURE. [ Catherine ] OH, NO.

WE GOTTA GET BUSY. OH. WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS? IT'S THE ARMY'S WAY OF FINDING OUT IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET MARRIED. WELL, I KNOW A MUCH BETTER WAY. HENRI. [ Ringing ] MAJOR PRENDERGAST. YES. AT EASE, GATES. THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT. WELL, GATES? I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, MAJOR, BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD ABOUT OUR APPLICATION. IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK. YOUR PAPERS MUST'VE BOGGED DOWN SOMEWHERE. ISN'T THERE SOMETHING YOU CAN DO TO HURRY THEM UP? HE'S GETTING AWFULLY NERVOUS, AND SO AM I. I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO. I'LL LET YOU KNOW. THANK YOU, MAJOR. OH, GATES. YES, MAJOR? HE IWORTH WAITING FOR, ISN'T HE? WELL, HE IS NOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE'LL BE LIKE BY THE TIME I GET HIM. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND AN AMERICAN MARRYING A FOREIGNER SHE HARDLY KNOWS. IT'S RIDICULOUS AND DISGRACEFUL. I JUST CAN'T SEE WHY SHE WANTS TO. YOU ALL BETTER GET GLASSES. WHY ARE YOU WOMEN SUCH PUSHOVERS FOR THIS PARLEZ VOUS HAND KISSING STUFF? HAND KISSING? WHY, HE DOES MORE THAN THAT. WHY, CATHERINE TOLD ME HE WAS PLUMB CRAZY. ALWAYS CHASING HER AND TRYING TO BEAT HER UP. WHY, HE LEFT MARKS ALL OVER HER. I SAW 'EM. LEAVE MARKS ON ME ANY TIME. I'LL BRING THE STICK. OH, IT WASN'T A STICK. HE KICKED HER RIGHT IN THE-- WHAT? WELL, HE DID. HI, CATHERINE. WE WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT YOU, HONEY. I'LL BET YOU WERE. OH. WELL, SAY SOMETHING. DID YOU SEE HER? DON'T LOSE YOUR TEMPER. THE PAPERS ARE STUCK SOMEWHERE. STUCK, HOW? WELL, BOGGED DOWN IN CHANNELS, LYING ON SOMEONE'S DESK. WHAT FOR? HENRI, PLEASE. I DON'T KNOW. WELL, THEY LET OTHER PEOPLE GET MARRIED. WHAT HAVE THEY GOT AGAINST YOU? AGAINST ME? IT'S PROBABLY YOU THEY'RE INVESTIGATING. NONSENSE. WHY SHOULD THEY? HENRI, PLEASE. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE ROOM. WHY SHOULD THEY INVESTIGATE ME? BECAUSE THE AMERICAN ARMY IS VERY CAREFUL. THAT'S WHY. AMERICAN ARMY HAD BETTER BE CAREFUL, OR THEY'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY AMERICAN CHILDREN SOON. WILL YOU KINDLY LOWER YOUR VOICE? I'LL DO BETTER THAN THAT. I'LL TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE IF IT ANNOYS YOU. DO THAT, AND WHILE YOU'RE ABOUT IT, GO BAG YOUR OARS. "BAG YOUR OARS"? WHAT'S THAT, MORE ARMY TALK? NAVY. OH, NAVAL TALK. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT. CHARMING. YOU MAKE ME SICK. GOOD. HENRI. EXCUSE ME.

I KNEW IT WAS A CINCH YOU'D CHANGE YOUR MIND. YOU HID THE PAPERS? THAT'S RIGHT. I KNEW I WAS DOING YOU A FAVOR. YOU HID THE PAPERS. I PUT THEM IN THE ADVANCE FILE. DON'T MIND GOING OUT ON A LIMB FOR A FRIEND. IT WAS TAKING A CHANCE, SURE-- NOW AS TO YOUR MARRIAGE, YOU, CATHERINE, WANT ME TO MARRY YOU IN MY CHURCH. THAT'S RIGHT. AND YOU, HENRI, ALWAYS PROMISED... THE PASTOR OF YOUR PARISH THAT HE'D DO THE JOB. YES. I THINK YOU'D BETTER HAVE BOTH MARRIAGES. I THINK HE'S RIGHT. OH, YES, YES. JUST A MOMENT. THERE'S MORE TO IT THAN THAT. UNDER THE GERMAN LAW, WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY THE OCCUPYING ARMY, YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH A CIVIL CEREMONY BEFORE THE CHURCH CEREMONY. OH? SO YOU HAVE TO BE MARRIED FIRST... BY THE BÜRGERMEISTER HERE IN HEIDELBERG, AH. AND THEN COME TO ME, AND THEN GO TO HENRI'S PASTOR. THAT MAKES THREE TIMES. THREE? CHAPLAIN, DID YOU KNOW THAT IN CHINA, THE BRIDE AND GROOM JUST DRINK TEA... OUT OF THE SAME BOWL, AND THAT'S IT? ARE YOU CHINESE, HENRI? OF COURSE I'M NOT CHINESE. I DIDN'T THINK YOU WERE. I'M NOT. WHAT BROUGHT THAT UP? YOU JUST SAID SOMETHING ABOUT DRINKING TEA. I WAS TELLING THE CHAPLAIN-- I'LL DRINK TEA WITH YOU IF YOU WANT ME TO. YOU DO? STOP IT. STOP IT. CHAPLAIN, PERHAPS I SHOULDN'T GO THROUGH WITH THIS. YOU CAN STILL SAY NO, HENRI. WE'LL GO TO THE BÜRGERMEISTER, AND THEN COME BACK TO YOU. I'LL BE READY FOR YOU ANY TIME. THANK YOU. DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HER, CHAPLAIN. ALL RIGHT. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. [ Speaking German ] YOU HAVE DECIDED NOW TO LIVE YOUR FUTURE LIFE TOGETHER. [ Speaking German ] AND FORSAKING ALL OTHER, KEEP THEE ONLY UNTO HIM SO LONG AS YE BOTH SHALL LIVE? I WILL. WILL YOU PLEASE JOIN RIGHT HANDS? HENRI, WILL YOU REPEAT AFTER ME? I, HENRI... I, HENRI... TAKE THEE, CATHERINE... TAKE THEE, CATHERINE-- TO BE MY WEDDED WIFE. [ Speaking French ] [ Speaking French ] HE WANTS THE RING. I HAVEN'T GOT IT. OH, HERE. I-- [ Speaking French ] WELL, YOU LIKE IT? I LIKE IT. IT'S BEEN QUITE A DAY, HASN'T IT? WE'RE A LOT MARRIED, HENRI, THREE TIMES. IT WAS WORTH IT. I DON'T SEE HOW WE COULD EVER GET A DIVORCE. IT WOULD BE SOMETHING LIKE UNWINDING THE INSIDE OF A GOLF BALL. WANT SOME MORE COFFEE? I JUST HAD FOUR CUPS. BESIDES, IT KEEPS ME AWAKE. OH. WHAT'S THE MATTER? I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT A FRIEND OF MINE ON HIS WEDDING NIGHT. OH? WHAT HAPPENED? WELL, YOU SEE, HE WAS A-- [ Doorbell Buzzes ] [ Speaking French ] NO, NO. NOT TONIGHT. NO, NO. NO, NO.

WELL, I CERTAINLY DIDN'T WANNA COME HERE. THEN GO AWAY. I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU FIRST, AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE IT. WHAT IS IT? I'VE JUST BEEN ON THE PHONE. THE COLONEL GAVE ORDERS YOU'RE TO LEAVE FOR HEIDELBERG IN 20 MINUTES. YOU'RE KIDDING. THE WHOLE OUTFIT'S BEEN ALERTED TO GO BACK TO AMERICA. TO AMERICA? WELL, THEY'RE NOT GOING RIGHT AWAY. WELL, I DON'T KNOW. THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO LEAVE TONIGHT. MAYBE YOU DON'T, BUT CATHERINE DOES. THOSE ARE ORDERS. WHEN DO I HAVE TO REPORT? NOT UNTIL MORNING. THEN WE STAY HERE TONIGHT, AND FLY BACK AND REPORT IN THE MORNING. ORDERS. YOU COULD TELL THE COLONEL YOU COULDN'T FIND US. HE BEAT YOU TO IT. HE SAID IF I TRIED TO PULL THAT ONE, WE'D BOTH BE SORRY. OH! CATHY, I'M IN A SPOT. SO ARE YOU. YOU'VE GOT TO GET WORKING ON HENRI'S PASSPORT, OR HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAIL WITH YOU. HENRI, WE'RE DEAD. WELL, THIS IS A FINE WEDDING NIGHT! YOU CAN FIND A PLACE TO STAY IN HEIDELBERG. IT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NOTHING? YOU BETTER START PACKING. YOU'VE ONLY GOT 20 MINUTES. HOW DO WE GET BACK FROM HERE? PLANE TO FRANKFURT. THERE'LL BE A JEEP THERE. SEE YOU LATER. ORDERS ARE I'M TO STICK WITH YOU UNTIL YOU GET TO HEIDELBERG. ORDERS. ORDERS? UH-- ORDERS. THEY WOULDN'T DO THIS IN THE FRENCH ARMY. POOR HENRI. UH-OH. WANT ME TO WAIT FOR YOU? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, WAIT? WHAT, ALL NIGHT? I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THAT LONG. UH-- WHAT KIND OF TROUBLE ARE YOU DREAMING UP NOW? I JUST NOTICED WHERE YOU'RE GOING. IT SAYS "B.O.Q." OH, NO. THAT MEANS BACHELOR OFFICERS' QUARTERS, HENRI. I DON'T CARE WHAT IT MEANS. THAT IS WHERE I LIVE, AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO TAKE MY WIFE. BUT IT'S AGAINST REGULATIONS. WHO CARES ANYTHING ABOUT REGULATIONS AT A TIME LIKE THIS? BESIDES, I KNOW THE SERGEANT ON THE DESK, AND HE ALWAYS LOOKS THE-- HE'S A VERY NICE FELLOW. COMES FROM TULSA, OKLAHOMA. DRIVER, PLEASE TAKE LIEUTENANT LAWRENCE HOME. GOOD NIGHT, KITTY. GOOD NIGHT, HENRI. COME ALONG, CATHERINE. BUT, HENRI, I-- NOW, PLEASE. GOOD NIGHT, KITTY. GOOD NIGHT, CATHERINE. HOPE IT WORKS. LEAVE IT TO ME. [ Car Drives Off ] [ Doorbell Buzzes ] IT'S JUST US, KITTY. SHH! B.O.Q. MEANS BACHELOR OFFICERS' QUARTERS. I TOLD YOU IT DID-- AND AFTER THAT, WE WENT TO SIX HOTELS. THEY'RE ALL AGAINST-- NO MILITARY PERSONNEL-- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? BILLINGS IS ON THE COUCH, AND THOMPSON AND KAY ARE IN THE BEDROOM. WHAT ARE THEY DOING HERE? SLEEPING. OH, NO. COME ON, CATHERINE. WHERE, HENRI? I DON'T KNOW, BUT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD, MAN HAS ALWAYS FOUND A PLACE FOR HIS MATE, EVEN IF IT WAS A CAVE. WELL, TONIGHT MANKIND'S A FLOP. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CAVE. YOU HAVEN'T EVEN GOT A BED. IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING, AND IT'S MY WEDDING NIGHT, AND MY FEET HURT, AND I COULDN'T WALK ANOTHER STEP. YES, DARLING, YES. WELL, DO YOU WANT TO SLEEP HERE? NO. I MEAN, YES, BUT I WANT YOU TO SLEEP HERE TOO. WELL, YOU CAN BUNK UP WITH ME, AND HE CAN SLEEP IN THE BATHROOM. SITTING UP? IT'S NOT SO BAD.

I'LL BE QUITE COMFORTABLE. I'LL JUST TURN ON THE COLD WATER. [ Sniffles ] [ Banging ] [ Grunts ] [ Moans ] [ Sighs ] HMM. OH, COME ON, HENRI. HURRY UP. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS TO DO. I AM HURRYING, JUST AS FAST AS I CAN GO. WELL, STRAIGHTEN UP. YOU LOOK LIKE A QUESTION MARK. OH! THANK YOU. THERE. THAT'S BETTER. [ Sighs ] WHAT A PLACE TO PUT A FAUCET. WHERE? IN THE MIDDLE OF MY BACK. IT IS UNUSUAL. WELL, CHEER UP, DEAR. AT LEAST TONIGHT YOU'LL HAVE A BED TO SLEEP ON. WELL, THAT'S JUST IT. CATHERINE, I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND CRANKY, BUT THIS SITUATION IS SO UNNATURAL. I'LL BE AT B.O.Q. AND YOU'LL BE SLEEPING MILES AWAY, ALL BECAUSE THE UNITED STATES ARMY-- WE HAVEN'T GOT TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER PLACE TODAY. WE'VE GOT TO SEE THE AMERICAN CONSUL. COME ON, SILLY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE GUTTER? WHERE ELSE WOULD I BE? NOW, I KNOW IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND YOU'RE IN A HURRY, BUT IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY. TAKE THE MATTER OF SUPPORT. CAPTAIN, HAVE YOU ANY MONEY IN THE UNITED STATES? NO. AND THE LAWS OF YOUR COUNTRY... FORBID YOU TAKING ANYTHING BUT A NOMINAL AMOUNT WITH YOU. YES, I'M AFRAID THAT'S RIGHT. THEN A VISITOR'S VISA WOULD DO YOU NO GOOD. YOU COULDN'T TAKE A JOB. AND UNLESS YOUR WIFE CAN PROVE... THAT SHE'S ABLE TO SUPPORT YOU, YOU COULDN'T GET A PERMANENT VISA. CATHERINE ISN'T GOING TO SUPPORT ME, SO IS THERE ANY OTHER KIND OF VISA? WHAT ABOUT THE FRENCH QUOTA? THE FRENCH QUOTA'S COMPLETELY FILLED UP FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT. WELL, WHAT'LL WE DO? I WAS WONDERING... IF PUBLIC LAW 271 WOULD APPLY. THAT'S THE ONE REGULATING THE IMMIGRATION OF WAR BRIDES. CATHERINE DOESN'T HAVE TO IMMIGRATE. SHE'S AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. I WAS THINKING OF YOU AS THE BRIDE. [ Chuckles ] THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD IMAGINATION YOU HAVE THERE. IT SAYS SPOUSES. DOESN'T MENTION SEX. I'M CONVINCED THE AMERICAN ARMY DOESN'T BELIEVE IN IT. THIS IS GONNA WORK. YES, I THINK THIS IS GONNA WORK. WELL, SURE, IT WILL. SAY, THIS IS WONDERFUL. WHAT'S SO WONDERFUL? IT SAYS SPOUSES MEANS MATES. DOESN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT MALE OR FEMALE. WE'RE MATES, AREN'T WE? [ Chuckles ] I REALLY WOULDN'T KNOW. YOU'RE A SPOUSE OF A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN EXPEDITION FORCES. THEREFORE, YOU'RE ELIGIBLE TO TRAVEL... UNDER SECTION 271 AS HER BRIDE. AS HER BRIDE? NO, HENRI, PLEASE. AS YOUR BRIDE? OH, HENRI, IT'LL BE FUN. BUT ISN'T IT RIDIC-- OF COURSE IT IS, DARLING, BUT IT'LL WORK. YOU'LL SEE. IT'S THE ONLY WAY. HERE'S THE APPLICATION RIGHT HERE. I AM NOT GOING TO TRAVEL AS HER BRIDE. AND BESIDES, HER NAME'S ROCHARD. EXCUSE ME, CAPTAIN ROCHARD, BUT OFFICIALLY, IT'S STILL GATES. NOT AT ALL. OFFICIALLY, IT IS ROCHARD. I HAVE THREE WEDDING CERTIFICATES TO PROVE IT. HENRI. I DON'T CARE. ROCHARD. ROCHARD. PAY NO ATTENTION TO HIM, MR. JONES. WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO? HERE YOU FILL OUT YOUR NAME, RANK, ORGANIZATION, YOUR WIFE'S MAIDEN NAME. SHE HASN'T GOT A WIFE. JUST FOR THE TIME BEING. HAVE YOU GOT A WIFE? NO, DEAR. BUT IT'S ONLY A PIECE OF PAPER. WELL, THEN YOU-- WELL, OBVIOUSLY THESE APPLICATIONS... ARE INTENDED FOR THE HUSBAND TO FILL IN. OH, WELL, I CAN WRITE. I CAN WRITE. YES, WE KNOW, DEAR. YOU CAN WRITE. NO, THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO YOU. YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE THE PROPER ADJUSTMENTS. WHAT? ON THESE PAPERS. YOU WANT TO GO, DON'T YOU? WHAT? I TELL YOU, HENRI, IT'S THE ONLY WAY. JUST HAND THOSE OVER TO THE IMMIGRATION OFFICER WHEN YOU'VE FILLED THEM OUT. THANK YOU, MR. JONES. BUT, CATHERINE-- IT'LL BE SIMPLE. YOU'LL SEE. ON THE CONTRARY, THE PROCESS OF TURNING A MAN INTO A WOMAN... IS ENORMOUSLCOMPLICATED. BUT I'LL DO MY BEST. THANK YOU. GOOD DAY. GOOD DAY. GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE. JUST A MOMENT. BRIDES FIRST, PLEASE. OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. HELLO, HENRI. WELL, NOTHING HAPPENED. HASN'T IT COME YET? I WONDER IF THE APPLICATION EVEN ARRIVED. I HANDED IT TO THE IMMIGRATION OFFICER MYSELF FIRST THING THIS MORNING. HENRI, BRACE YOURSELF. I'M LEAVING. OUR WHOLE OUTFIT LEAVES TONIGHT. TONIGHT? OH, WELL, THAT DOES IT. WE'RE COOKED. THE APPLICATION WILL COME THIS AFTERNOON. IT'S GOT TO. IT WON'T. OH, YOU'LL SEE. YOU'LL GO, AND I'LL SIT HERE WONDERING WHICH SEX I AM. WHAT A MARRIAGE. SOLITARY CONFINEMENT. SEPARATE ROOMS. I'VE NEVER BEEN SO LONELY IN MY LIFE. IF I HAVE TO LEAVE YOU, I'LL SHOOT MYSELF. SHOOT ME TOO. I'M-- I THINK THIS IS IT. IT CAME TO THE OFFICE. THANK YOU, KITTY. [ Muttering ] AT LAST. "DEAR MADAME"? OH, YES, THAT'S ME. "FOLLOWING APPLICATION OF YOUR HUSBAND--" THAT'S YOU-- "YOU ARE INFORMED THAT PERMISSION TO ENTER THE UNITED STATES... AS A WAR BRIDE HAS BEEN GRANTED." I GOTTA GET BACK.
