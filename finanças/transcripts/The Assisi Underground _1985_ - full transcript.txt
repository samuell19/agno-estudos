[knocking on door] -Padre Rufino! -What is it? -The bishop wants to see you. It's very urgent. -Now? -Yes, right now! [orchestral music] [bell chimes] -Padre Rufino. -What I am going to say must remain... [speaking in Italian] In strict secrecy. -Of course, Monsignor. -Some refugees must be taken to Genova. I want you to deliver. -But what about Don Brunacci? -He is in charge of refugees in the South. These are not ordinary refugees;they are Jews. There is a rabbi among them. They arrived in Assisi only an hour ago. The Germans occupied Rome yesterday. -So we are now under German rule? -The area in the North, yes. Hitler has been rushing troops to the South to stop the Allied advance. Cardinal De La Costa, archbishopof Florence, has instructed me to have his group delivered to Genova. In this letter, which is for you, I have vouched that these peopleare Christian pilgrims returning to their homes from Assisi. You don't have to stay. We'll be at your side. Good night, Don Arthur. -Good night, Padre. [Padre Rufino] When do you want me to leave, Monsignor ? -At once. -I will leave you a few bottlesof my family's Santa Giustina. -Monsignor, why me? -Because you and I are peasants. Your family grinds the wheat. Mine, in Trento, squeezes the grape. We understand each other. And also, because you are the only one in town who won't lose his head when questioned by the SS or the Fascist police. -I hope not. -You are my man of trust, my uomo di fiducia. Irma, pack some food for the journey. Rabbi, this is Padre Rufino, your guide. [speaking in foreign language] -There is one favor I want to ask, Monsignor. -Yes? -This is a Jewish Torah scroll. Saved from a Roman synagogue. It is sacred to us. It contains the first five booksof the Old Testament. -This is also sacred to us, being part of our scriptures. You want me to safeguard it for you? -Yes, please. -I will keep it under my own bed. I will wait for your return. -If something happens on the way, if I fail to return, please send the Torah to a Jewish community after the war. -And why should you fail to return? -You must have heard the rumorsabout Auschwitz and Dachau, and what happens to Jews there. -But this is Italy! The Italians would not stand for that. It could not happen here. Not in the land of Dante, Manzoni, Petrarca! -That is what the German Jews kept saying. It could not happen here. Not in the land of Goethe, and Schiller, and Heine. -Thank you, Irma. -Thank you, Monsignor. Thank you very much. -Be with God, my son. [praying] -Amen. [bell chimes] [suspenseful music] [whistle] [whistle] [whistle] -Tickets please! Tickets! Good. Here. -Thank you. [reading in Latin] [train braking] -Take my man and check the documents of the passengers. -Proceed! [orchestral music] -Your identity card. [speaking in German] [explosion] -Get out! At once! Go! Get out of the station! [guns firing] [explosion] [missiles dropping] -Oh, thank God! -And the English! [tense music] -Please sit down. I need your help. Field Marshal Kesselring, Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces,asked me to find a Professor... Mario Rieti. He is a foremost authority in nuclear research. And, he could help us win the war, quickly! -How can I be of service, General? -He disappeared from his home yesterday, in a hurry. You see, his wife is Jewish... -And so the Wehrmachtneeds the assistance of the SS. I understand. I would be happy to be of service to you, General. And to Field Marshall Kesselring. -Thank you. -I should find him. -Good. -Hail Hitler! -Thank you. [traditional music] [car honk] -Look at him! An old, fat fascist policecommander, falling all over her. -Bertolucci is a fool. -Padre Rufino, Monsignor. -Ah! I'm entrusting you with a new assignment. We now have to hide a group of Jews here in Assisi at least for the time being. -But if we do that, we endangereveryone in the town. -What better place than a holy city? -How many Jews are there? -Fifteen. -Fifteen? -They have escaped from Trieste. But also... Irma, will you bring our guests in? Professor and Mrs. Rieti. -You are the man the Germans are looking for! -Yes. I'm afraid I'm the one. Sorry for causing you all the trouble. -Thank you. We are very grateful. -It is essential for the Professor to escape. His discoveries could be ofvalue to the Allies and no lessto the Germans! We must hide them, and the others, until we can supply them with suitable papers. -What papers? -False identity cards. What else? [truck engine] -Attenzione! Attenzione! All citizens remain indoors! We are searching for illegalresidents, subversive elements, and all the deserters! Anyone hiding them... will be shot. -Where is your identity card? [knocking on door] -Giorgio Kropf. -Padre Rufino. Did you have any trouble getting here? No, the taxi took the old road. -When you are all settled, may Ihave your identity cards? -Sister, no identity cards. -But this is the law. We must fill in the names in theguest book for the police. -No names, sister, please. -I think I better talk to Mother. -Sister! Let me talk to Mother. -Come with me. -You wanted to see me, Padre. -Yes, Mother. You remember when God commandedSaint Francis to kiss the leper? -Of course. -Well, Saint Francis obeyed andembraced the most despised. Those were terrible times, Mother. War raged between nations just as it does now. -What is it that you want, Padre? -We also have our outcast, Mother. Not just despised, but persecuted and threatened with death. And we must embrace themin the spirit of Saint Francis. These are not ordinary refugees who seek shelter here. They are Jews, Mother. -Oh, I understand. -Then you also understand that it is impossible for the names to be found in the guest book! -How can I keep this from my sisters? -We are the successors ofSaint Teresa and Saint Francis. We must offer them our protection. Those are the Lord Bishop's orders. -I will swear my sisters the secrecy. They may stay. -Thank you. -Everything is alright, you may stay. -Thank you. I'm Edward Gelb, this is mywife, Matilde. -Thank you. -Padre Rufino. -My daughters are next door. -Hello. -Come on, start unpacking! -Can we stay? -Yes, yes. -Thank you. -It's alright, you don't have to register your names. -Wonderful! Thank you very much. -We saved the bottle for the occasion. You will share a glass with us,won't you Padre? -I never refuse a glass of wine. A housewarming party? -No. Today is our new year. Rosh Hashanah. 5704. -New year? In September? I know nothing about you Jews, but if we celebrate, we do it properly! [tense music] -Cigarette. -Would you be so kind as to tell me where Professor Rieti is staying? -We know nothing. He and his wife only stayed for one night. [guns firing] -You would spare us all a greatdeal of pain if you tell me that Professor Rieti is fine. Perugia Prison. -Chana Tova. Happy New Year. L'chaim! [all] L'chaim! -Here, Padre. Our present to you. The History of the Italian Jews. We are as Italian as... as Garibaldi! -Thank you, Carlo. Thank you, thank you! [Padre Rufino] L'chaim! [people toasting] Kosher wine. [banging on door] -Leave me alone! Where are you bringing me? -What do you want from us? -Alberto! -Maria, stay close to me! [singing in Yiddish] [guns firing] -The Germans. -Where is Mother? -She's at the choir with the sisters, praying. -Praying at such a time? I must speak with her! Quickly! Keep calm. Mother, quickly! Take on the Jews into the cloister. -Men. Men in a female cloister? That's impossible, Father. We've all made the vow of seclusion. -Then break it! -Never. Never in 700 years, since our order of enclosure was established, has thecanonical enclosure been broken. Only the Pope can command me to break the vow! -The Pope is far away! -But Saint Clare is near, she will protect us all. -Mother, this is a matter of life or death! -What is death, if not a step to real life? -All you do is shave your head and pray all day! [speaking in German] -A sister, a nun is dying. She wants a bishop to administerthe last sacrament. [speaking in German] -Thank you Saint Clare! -Weren't you stopped on the way here? -Yes I was, but I said that a nun was dying and wanted you to administer the last sacrament. -Didn't I say that you were the only one in this town who would not lose his head when questioned? -You see? They are searching the monasteries. [knocking on door] -Mother Giuseppina! Break the enclosure, Mother. Let all the Jews come in here! -I need the Pope's order. I am the Pope's representative in the diocese. I am carrying out his orders. -I did not know Monsignor. -Mother, please move quickly. They have already entered the Benedictine Monastery. -They have entered the Monastery? -Yes, they have! So please hurry! -I am glad the Pope's order arrived in time. -The Pontiff, I'm sure, would have given such an order if he had been here in my place. [banging on door] -Search the place! The guest book! Did a certain Professor Rieti and his wife try to get lodgings here? -No one has inquired recently about lodgings. -How dare you? How dare you enter the monastery armed and question us? Aren't you ashamed? -I'm sorry Mother, but I... Please, forgive us. -They're gone! Thank God! -Padre, we must get out. -But this is the safest place for you. -We don't mean out of the cloister... Italy. -But what else doyou expect me to do? -Can't you get us forged identity cards? Christian ones? -For your safety, as well as ours. -Alright, I will see what I can do. But please stay inside. [traditional music] -Waiter. -No. Today, I treat you. -No. Well, I have to go back to work. -Luigi. Let us take a walk together. I have some business to discuss with you. Some printing work for the monastery? -You could say that, yes. -Free? -Come! Via Eugenio Brizi. And there is his statue, up there. Any relation, Luigi? -You know damn well who he was! The city's mayor, a colleague of Garibaldi. And my great uncle. -Did you know that Garibaldi hadhundreds of Jews in his army? And that without Jewish financial support he could never have succeeded in uniting Italy. -What the hell are you driving at? -That your great uncle would be ashamed of you for doing nothing for Italy, nothing for democracy... And nothing for the Jews hiding in this town. -Oh Christ!And you are the one hiding them? -That's why I need your help. To print false identity cards for them. -Oh! for God's sake? How? -Don Brunacci gave me samples of identity cards from cities now under Allied control. If we can pass the Jews off as Catholic refugees from those cities, there will be no way for the SSto check the validity. Hm? -The title page was the problem. Too much ink. Now this is fine. -Luigi, this is excellent! -I know. Look at those! Those are town seals from the South. -You made these? -What do you think a printer does? I mean, a good printer. Just wedding invitations and visiting guides? [engine roaring] [dogs barking] [speaking in German] -They are determined to catch this Professor Rieti. As if anyone was idiot enough to hide him in Assisi. Oh my God! -Come on. [traditional music] -Jacomo Baruti. Your identity card. Amedeo Bianci. -From Padre Rufino. -Thank you. -Is someone sick? -Yes, a nun. -Professor Rieti. This is for you. -Thank you. We got insulin. Enough for a while. -Thank God. -A Roman temple? -Yes, now it's a church. Dedicated to Santa Rita. -Very beautiful. Shall we have a drink somewhere? -Yes, let's go to there. -Well, why don't we take one here? -As you wish. -Thank you. I'd like to try the local wine. Wine. Three glasses, please. Who's that Franciscan over there? -That's Father Rufino. The padre guardian of San Damiano. -San Damiano? -With him is Mister Brizzi, printer. -I would like to meet that Padre. -But of course. -Padre Rufino. I'm Valentin Muüller. The new town commander. -Welcome. -I'm glad to make your acquaintance. I must pay you a visit. I always wanted to see the place where San Francis has built a church for God. Do you mind if I drop by sometime? No, of course not. -Thank you. - Signore Brizzi. -Ah, SignoreBrizzi. You're a painter? -A printer. -Oh, sorry. Please, I don't want to interrupt your game. Ah, the wine. -Thank you. -I raise my drink to Assisi. -To Assisi. -Gino Bartali, the great champion! You are Cardinal De La Cruz' courier? -In person. Any time I pass a checkpoint, the soldiers wish me well. They are convinced that Gino Bartali is in training, trying to regain the Italian championship. And you know something? I will. Mark my word. Three hours, 48 minutes. From Florence to Assisi. Isn't that great? -It's marvellous. You have the photographs? -Yes, of course. Here. -The documents will be ready in the morning. -Good. -Go inside. [tense music] -Father. -Good morning, Colonel Muüller. -So it was here. -Yes. This is the church that Saint Francis built with his own hands. For God. -Will you show me around? -Yes, of course. Saint Clare, when she was here... She was brought here... to listen to the mess. -So it was really here that Saint Francis wrote his Canticle of the Creatures. Yes. In Saint Clare's little garden. There it is, commemorated in stone. You seem to know a lot about our order, Colonel Muüller. -I come from a very religious family. Here... My wife. My two children. We live in Aschheim, near Munich. I have not seen them for over a year. -Colonel, I can't help feelingthat your appointment to Assisi was made not only by German high command. But also by God. -Anything I can do to help the Church, I will do. And in case I don't see you before Christmas, Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas, Colonel. Good afternoon! [all] Good afternoon! -I like kosher cooking! -You want to fight him? -Yes, I do. You think you are strong, uh? -Of course I am. -Ready? Go! -You like it? -Yes I do! But it looks like me, it shouldlook like Saint Francis! Perhaps I could sell this for you to make some money. [bell chimes] -Padre Rufino. The cardinal wants you to make another expedition. This time to the South. -The South. -Pescocostanzo, here on the Sangro River. We have persuaded the smugglersnot only to bring food from the Allied side of the River, but to take our refugees to the Allied side. It's where they make money for themselves Come look. -Good. I will take the San Quirico group. -No, I must explain something to you. Cardinal has selected the first group himself. They arrived here last night, they have perfect documents. -You mean they are not even our Jews? -Padre Rufino, there are 40,000 Italian Jews and they are all our Jews. We are responsible for them. Professor Rieti, however, must be included in the group. -By the trains running to Pescocostanzo? -No, it's too near the frontline. You must go by road. -But how? On the way there, the Germans will stop us a dozen times! -That's exactly why the Cardinal chose you! You are so good at confronting Germans. Apparently you are not only my uomo di fiducia, but also the cardinal's. -It's my wife. I can't leave her, Padre. -She will never survive the trip. Please, take these papers to the Allies. They are important. -I'm sorry! I planned that you would be the first to leave. But hopefully, if this trip is successful, we will get you all out in the same way. -I'm going with you. -Can't you wait for the next group and take your family along with you? -Yes, but first I want to see the escape route. -Please Giorgio, don't! -I agree. One of us ought to go. -You don't trust me? -I'm going. -Ah, Padre. It's you! -Good morning. -Good to see you. Please sit down. -I hope I'm not disturbing you. -No, no, no, no, no. I'm just trying to get a letterto the familyof Corporal Schultz. How do you tell parents that their son is dead? How could you express that in a letter? I never find the right words. -I know, I have written such letters myself. The few hours of sleep every night, I think I'm coming down with flu. Some wine? Good medicine. Warms you up. -I don't have the flu, but I will join you. -Preventive medicine. For you. Believe me, I'm a doctor. More doctor than officer. Very important to know it. Tchin tchin. -An excellent wine. I will give you a few bottles before you leave. -Thank you. -I suppose that this is not a social visit. -No. -What can I do for you? Look, nothing to stress. -Well, a group of pilgrimsfrom Pescocostanzo are strandedhere in Assisi. There are no trains running. I wondered... If you could help us with some transport. -Transport... -The Lord Bishop joins me in this request. I would be going too. Together with an art historian,well... a restorer. To see a precious fresco that has suffered bomb damage. -A fresco, from whom? -Luini. -Luini. The pupil of Leonardo. I rather like his work. Why do you want to go to Pesco...? -Pescocostanzo. -Pescocostanzo. Isn't that near the front? -Yes, that is why I'm asking for your help. -When would you like to leave? -As soon as possible. Their families must be worried by now. -And when would you be back? -I could be back tomorrow. -I think I could get you a truck. For one day. -But I will provide you with a known escort. One never knows. There might be partisans, or an Ally ambush. Yes, it would be better to have an escort. Thank you. Armed? Thank you very much, Colonel. I will arrange it for you. For you. -Come, please! This is your guide, Padre Rufino. The truck is ready! German truck, escorted by Germansoldiers. -Who's soldiers? Most of us saw our families for the last time, being taken in exactly the same way. -It's the safest way I could think of. [tense music] -Good morning, Colonel. -I came to make sure that everything has been arranged to your satisfaction. -Perfectly. Yes, absolutely. [tense music] -A letter from the Bishop. [speaking in German] -Padre Rufino, welcome! Just in time for breakfast. [speaking in German] -He will pick us up at 8 o'clockin the morning. [speaking in Yiddish] [praying in Latin] -Danke Padre. -It's all arranged. This is Pietro. -You have the money? -Yes, of course. -Pay. [religious music] -Here. Then we can go. [people chatting] -I think I will go with them. -Why? -This is the way my family and our friends are going to escape. I want to see it personally. -Then I go too. -Alright. -Come, I have eight children to feed! -And I have six, let's go. -We're going down too. We want to see how you do it. [explosions] I will deliver it to the Americans, myself. -God bless you, Rabbi. -Hurry, it's overloaded. Push us off! -Giorgio! Giorgio! -Padre? -He's drowning, he's drowning! -We must help him. -Padre Rufino! Padre? -He will get him out. We cannot stop. [explosions] -Come on! -It will take some timefor them to get their supplies. You lie down and rest. They will come soon, the Allies. The Germans have already mined all the public buildings in Pescocostanzo. -And then your business will come to an end. -So it will. And so will the killing. [birds chirping] -They are back! -We were held back, until it wassafe to cross. -They gave these things to the truck, some of it is for you. -Oh no! -Your share. For raising the money, taking the risk, and helping us. [speaking in German] [guns firing] -Here, take this.And get out of the forest, fast! I must help them. -Halt! [speaking in German] [explosion] -Let's go, hurry. Hurry! -Goodbye! Thank you again. -How was your trip to Pescocostanzo, Father? -Very good, thank God. -Halt! Those provisions did not comefrom the Allied side, by chance? -From the Allied side, how? -By smuggling. Anyway, all the approachesto the River San Guliano closed. -But shouldn't we confiscate the food? -What do you mean? The priest of Pescocostanza was generous enough to share their supplies with our monasteries. -Of course. [speaking in German] -Father, you have made a trip toPescocostanza for the last time. German trucks are for transporting troops and war materials not for pilgrims! -That's my responsibility, Captain. -With all due respect, Colonel... Last night, three smugglers were killed, and this truck was in the same area. I find it... suspicious. -Why? -Instinct. -But we need facts, Captain. With all due respect. -Forgive give Colonel, but German soldiers... -I don't want to discuss this here. -I shall investigate the matterand give you facts. -Please do. -Corporal, get into my car. -I want your report! -I'm afraid he's right, I did exceed my powers. However, the reason I came hereis to tell you I've written to Field Marshal Kesselring. Asking him to agree to make Assisi an open city. -Ah, good! I understand the Vaticanhas already requested the same. -The Vatican has? -Yes. -What have you learned, from Rieti's friends? -Nothing of interest. -Nothing? -Well, only that his wife is a diabetic. -A diabetic? Good. You, check every hospital and doctor in the area. Understood? -Yes sir. -I want to know about everyone who has been buying insulin. -Yes sir! -Some garlic. -And some sugar. I'm sorry, I could not get any oil. -You have done enough for us. -How can you be so calmafter what Giorgio has told us? -What if the SS comes for us here? -Did you arrange the warning signal? -Yes. If they come, the bells of Santa Maria degli Angeli will ring three times. Then, three times again. -Good! -What do we do then? -Then we really upon the Ancient Romans. Behind this wardrobe is a subterranean passage which runs through the city walls and out! -Padre! -Excuse me. -My wife! -We have run out of insulin. -I can't get any more! [speaking in Yiddish] -After the war, the cross willbe changed to the star of David. [praying in Latin] -She managed to escape them. We have not. -The lord giveth and the lord taketh away. Signora Bianci, throughout her entire life in Foggiawas a wonderful Christian woman. Much loved by her family, and she will be deeply missed by all who knew her. [speaking in Latin] [bell chimes] -This is the last of them, right? -In Assisi, yes. There are a dozen monasteries filled with people who are nowsafe because of your documents. -So? -We have just discovered there are a number of Jews hiding in a church in Perugia. -And now they are all coming to Assisi? -No, no. But they all need your identity cards. -Don't they have a printer therewho could do the job as well as I? -No, no. Luigi, you are unique! -Ah, unique. -How many? -Seventy. Oh, I forgot. The Bishop has asked me to convey his blessings to you and your family. -Tell the Bishop thatI'm not doing it for the Church. I'm doing it for Italy. -At last out of Assisi, even if for a while. -You're right. -I'm so glad that we have the documents, now we can sleep quietly. -Hey, let's go in to have a glass of wine! -Yes, alright! [jazz music] -Excuse me, I have to go to thebathroom. -Wine, please. -White, a litre. -Red wine. -You know, I really like Perugia! -Oh, it's nice here. So many pretty girls. Tchin tchin! -Tchin tchin. -It's not bad wine. Half wine, half water, still not bad. Georgio, more wine. [indistinct chatting] -Excuse me, what time is it? -11:30. -Your documents, please. Macri Paolo, born in Cosenza. That's in Calabria? But you have a Slav accent. You are under arrest, all of you! -But... -Assisi Food Ration Card... Ah. Assisi. [singing in Latin] -Where's Giorgio? -They have been arrested. [overlapping chatter] -Giorgio, Paolo and Lieutenant Poddu. -They might come here! -Keep calm! Everyone in the monastery is safe here. -It can't be... [tense music] [bell chimes] [bell chimes] -Come! Everybody! Quickly, quickly! -What are you... You can't comein here! -Check all the rooms in the convent! Halt! Where does the door lead to? -To the cloister. Only nuns are allowed! -Then open it! -Never! Madre Giuseppina! Madre Giuseppina! -How dare you? This is a convent. We are daughters of God! This is a cloister! A secluded cloister. Will you please leave, at once? Or I will call the Bishop. -Call the Pope if you like. Who uses this dormitory? -The novices, they are expectedto arrive... soon. -It's all arranged. We will stayhere until has passed and my friends will take you all to private homes. -But what about the Jews in theother monasteries? -When they hear the bells,they will run to Monte Subasio,there are partisans there. Professor Rieti, you will come with me. Nothing. The names Macri, Cernora and Poddu are not listed in the register. -Would you tell me why they arenot listed? -There must have been an oversight. Oversight? Have Professor Rieti and hiswife stayed in your guest house? -Who? -Professor Rieti. We know he has been hiding. -No one has been hiding here. -I will find him. Like I found the others. [praying] [praying in Latin] [praying in Latin] -Please, continue Padre. Well, if you're finished, I would like you to come with me to my office. It won't take long. Do you know this man? -Yes, I think so. This is the man you're looking for, Professor Rieti. You think he is in Assisi? -He is. Unless... Unless he was among the pilgrims. You transported them to Pescocostanzo. Was he among them? -No. Definitely not. -Ah. Lieutenant Poddu, an airforce officer. A deserter. Do you know him? -Yes I do. He stayedat the San Quirico guest house. -How do you know that, Padre? His name was not listed in the register. -Wasn't it? -No, it wasn't. Another name, Padre. Paolo Macri. An Italian with a Slav accent. Also stayed at San Quirico, also not registered. Since you know everyone there, you must have met him too. -I didn't say I knew everyone there, I'm the Father Guardian of San Damiano, not Mother Superior of San Quirico. -Very funny. You're a clever man, Padre. Perhaps too clever. For a peasant, from Deruta. Sorry. -He is a Slav, you say. Then he must be a memberof the Eastern Orthodox Church. So he would have no need to seek my spiritual help. -Among the papers found on him... was this one. With your name scribbled on it. Together with the telephone number of San Damiano. Could you tell me how this namecame into your possession? -I also have some names and telephone numbers. Colonel Muüller, telephone number 210. -Are you trying to make a fool out of me, Padre? I'm not as gullible as Colonel Muüller, you know? Because, you see, Padre, I'm not a Catholic. Alright, let's stop playing games. We know all about your movements. We have our informers. You think we don't know that many of the so-called refugees staying at various convent guest houses vanished? Just before we got to them. Which means, of course, that youhave your informers too! Well, Padre. Let's see which of us has better ones. I'm going to smash your agenda. And I won't rest until I do. We have shot 3,000 priests in Europe so far. Do you think we will hesitate to shoot one more? You give me no choice. Guard! -Caponeto Angelo! Guerrara Isaco! Niverrodi Giorgio! [bell chimes] -I want a crucifix! [speaking in German] [fly buzzing] Pasteli Cuccano. Fetti Attini. Santoro, Giuseppe! Niccacci, Rufino! [speaking in German] -I brought the second group. -We are ready. -Begin! -Murderers! -Fire! Second group. -Are you ready to confess? -I have nothing to confess. -You are not afraid of death, Padre? -I am only afraid of God. [praying in Latin] -Fire! -You have 24 hours. If you talk, you will be released immediately. I give you my word, as an officer. Otherwise, you will be shot. [speaking in Latin] -I have been informed that Padre Rufino Niccacci is in prison in Perugia awaiting execution. Let us now pray for his safe deliverance. [organ music] [praying in Latin] [all] Amen. -Get me General Bremer, it's urgent. -Yes sir. -General Bremer, it's urgent. General Bremer is on the phone. -General, this is Valentin Muüller. It's about Padre Rufino. No, no. I just found out now. Oh no, no, no. This is ridiculous. I can vouch for it. He's just a simple monk. Yes, please do. I'm sure there is no evidence. I would have phoned you immediately, but I just came back from Rome. I had a meeting. I would appreciate that. Thank you. -May I ask why, General? -Because I ordered it. -Since when does SS take ordersfrom the Wehrmacht in security matters? -It is not the Wehrmacht who has given the orders, it is I, in my capacity as Chief Justice of Perugia. -General, please. Just a few more hours. He will confess! -Captain von Velden... You have had six months to find Professor Rieti and you have failed. You have arrested and interrogated an unimportant priestwithout any conclusive evidence. -But I will get it! He's about to break down! -You have failed, Captain von Velden. Release Padre Rufino immediately. [speaking in German] -Hail Hitler! [bell chimes] [speaking in Latin] -Get back to Bertolucci. Well, what do you know, Padre Bianci? Padre Bianci? I see that you've becomea prior after your wife's death. Please, Padre. Come with me. Please. -Von Velden... Giorgio! I was released, Padre. And so were Paolo and Poddu. General Bremer reached the conclusion that our papers were in perfect order and there was no reason to keep us in jail. -But what does the car and this mean? -It means that I'm employed by the Wehrmacht. -No! You know, the Wehrmacht was short of interpreters and we both speak in perfect German. We are of great valueto the army of the Third Reich. That could be good to all of us, especially now. Monte Cassino is falling, and the German is in full retreat. And Padre, plans have been completed to evacuate Assisi! -Thank God! Thank God! -Professor Rieti is not in the cloister. We don't know where he is. -Take me to the cemetery. -Perseverance pays. -Captain von Velden will be very pleased. Alright, get him in the car. [car brakes] -Send him away. What, you are afraid of me? Send him away! -Alright, you can go. Go on. -Have you heard the news? -What news? -Monte Cassino has fallen. The Allies are rushing towards Rome. And the Germans have completed their plan to evacuate Assisi. -Evacuate Assisi? -I'm not talking to you as a priest, threatening you with God's vengeance. I'm talking to you as a man,about your future here on earth. In Assisi. -There is a big reward for him,you know? -And where will you spend it? In Germany? I give you my word, I will be the first to stand by you, if you release this man and stay silent. -Alright, get in. I will drive you both back to San Damiano. No. You will drive Professor Rieti to San Damiano. -They were ready to start two minutes ago. You have to act immediately. -I know where the documents are. You distract the guards. -Leave it to me. -See you then at the hospital. -Good luck. -Oh, sorry. Sorry. [suspenseful music] -What are you doing? Stop this! This is a holy city! [woman] Padre Rufino!

No. To a Jewish refugee and employee of the Wehrmacht. -What do you mean? Pablo, for God's sake, what do you mean? -I mean that General Bremer had in his office official blank papers, signed and stamped by the Field Marshal, in case of emergency. All I had to dowas to fill in the blank spaces. -You think he hasn't learned a thing or two from Luigi Brizzi. -You think he hasn't learned a thing or two from Luigi Brizzi. -Colonel. -Your excellency.

Muüller] I have a gift for you. For Assisi. -Yes? -I would be very grateful if you could accept it. -What is it? -I have issued orders not to empty our warehouses. Apart from the food, there are large quantities of medical supplies, surgical instruments, physiotherapy equipment and enough medicine to last for a long time. And, of course, nothing was moved from our hospitals. -It must be worth a fortune! I don't know how to begin to thank you. I will never forget it. You have saved Assisi from destruction. And now, this magnificent gift. I'm overwhelmed. Thank you, Colonel. -To Assisi. -To Assisi. -And... This moment. -I've been informed that you ordered my men out of the city. -That is right. -But there are still German soldiers in town. -Wounded German soldiers. Under my care. Their evacuation is in progress. I'm responsible for their safety. I'm responsible for security in Assisi. -And I'm responsible for Assisi. The company of regular troops will remain until your recreation is completed. But I want all SS troops to leave at once, and then I'm going to see to itpersonally that you and your men are out of here within an hour. -I will not follow your orders. -They're not my orders. Here. [birds chirping] -I know you have asked for this. You wanted to save this town. Colonel. Are you a German? Or a Catholic? -Both. And you, what are you? -I believe... I believe in our ultimate victory. They have always fought back. [Capt. von Velden] We shall fight back again! -The war is lost, von Velden. -You shall regret that remark. You're a traitor! [traditional music] -To think that von Veldenwas sure that you were in charge of the Assisi underground operation. The town is at its loveliest at this hour. I think I'll take a walk to bid it farewell. [people cheering] [fanfare music] -Sir. -As Assisi's Chief of Police, I have the honor of welcoming you on behalf of all the inhabitants whom all these years have been patiently waiting for your arrival. I want to express the gratitudeof all of us. For the liberation from the German Fascists. -Thank you! Do you know where Professor Mario Rieti is? -He must be in this square or somewhere. Ah, professore! Professor Rieti! Professor Rieti. -Pleased to meet you. I have orders to send you to the Ally command in Rome immediately, Professor. Lieutenant will accompany you. -Thank you very much. [car honk] [fanfare music] -Next year I will come and visit you. For Rosh Hashanah... 5705. -You are most welcome! -Thank you. Goodbye. -Join us! -Luigi, the town is once again ours! [narrator] All together, 80% of the Italian Jews were saved from Nazi execution. The very opposite of what happened in the rest of Europe, where 80% of the Jews perished. This film is a tribute to the compassion and the daring generosity of those individualsthat made this rescue possible. [classical music]
