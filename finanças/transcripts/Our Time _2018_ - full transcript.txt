How about your parents? My mom works in... English literature. Works in what? Do her feet, so It's like reflexology. - Okay. - She studied it. - What's this part? - I'm not sure, maybe the intestines. What? That means if I massage your toe, it affects your intestines So if it hurts you may have a problem there. - What's your favorite subject? - Spanish. Spanish? Mine are gender and sex ed, and English. Mine is Math. - I was really cold. - Me too! - Up and down it goes. - It's weird. There's clouds. and then... My foot's stuck... The older girls are so snotty. Especially Luciana and Jimena. And Paola too. Lea too. Let's get some for the weapons club. Ursi, here's the show... We'll use this one to hit Lea. Okay. Ursi, there's a knot in my necklace. Sure. Oh, Ursi! Take it easy! It's only mud. At least it's only mud, not knives! Imagine if it were knives! Yeah... Do you want some mud on you? What? No! It's good for your skin. - That's right. - Okay, then. My aunt uses mud masks... ...and her skin is really smooth. Mud masks? Yeah, but it's a special mud. I think this is also a great skin treatment. Let's kill the girls! Why so shy? - Are you always like that? - No! So what's the deal? I'm usually not shy. Lechera, are you there? What is it, boss? Where are you, Lechera? I'm at the stables. Go to the tack room, get Juan's lance and bring it to the paddock, please. Okay, I'm on it. I'll let you know. Any idea where the kids are? They're down at the pond, with Blanca. Thanks, Lechera. Please don't be long. You heard her, go. Relax! I sent Nati a voice message about it. There were two hands and a rose on the screen, and then it was just prayers. Remember when my dad used to fl ll beer bottles -with piss? - That's disgusting! - ...and he put them on the bar. Once someone did drink It. He got there cause he's a lunatic. He's crazy. He took so many drugs that he's still tripping. Everyone at the Visions Council despised him. They hated him. Sorry, Universe. Even the Universe hates him! "We kindly ask everyone in the community to attend holy mass this Sunday at 3 pm." - They start at 5 am... - Our Father who art in heaven... Mayeva, the aid that didn't come... - So you told Leo: "Attack!" - And Leo started... just asking to be caressed. And he came back like... - I need another beer. - Bring me one. Juan, pass one of those. You're filthy. Thanks. - Damn mud. - Want some? No way. Why "No way"? - I don't like that shit. - Don't be a dick. Juanito, are you a real man or not? Really. Juan? Hey! You guys! Hey, take it easy! - Did they get dirt on you? - Yeah! Alright, that's enough! - That's it. - What? You screwed up my hair! What are you gonna do? - You'd better wash it! - Sure, I'll wash it. Right here. - Okay, let's go. - You're on. - Go on, then! - Let's go. - It's cold! - It feels great. - You're all muddy. - Yup. - Do you want your hair washed? - Go on. What do you think you're doing? I knew it. You want to attack the kids? Your little cousins? No way. - Let's go for a swim. - Okay. It's too bad we're wearing sunscreen. Stop bouncing! You want me to bounce? - Did you wash my sister, slave? - Sure, man. Relax. Do you like the beach? Not really. Really? I love it! This guy understands me. And the salt! That guy's crazy. - The guy is... - Where is he from? He just showed up at the Visions Council. - The fat, bald guy? - He wasn't fat. It was the guy who looked like a caveman. - He had the face of a Neanderthal. - Manolo. He drank a shitload of pulque. How come he poured mezcal on the plants? Not mezcal... - What am you staring at? - Nothing. Can I have some? So his fucking ceremony screwed up all the plants. Water! Fucking dark magic. No, leave us alone. Get lost! Go play somewhere else. You wanna get drunk or high? - Go away! - Please give us some water. Get lost! Hey, Blanca! Can you lend me a hand, phase? Can we borrow a towel? Have you got a towel? Kano, Darshan, enough! Enough Santiago, go away! Diego, go away! You too, Milos. Blanquita! Could you pass it? Thanks. - You pull on this side. - Okay. Come on, Santi. I love you, Latena. Yes. Santi. ...come on! I want you inside me! Marlo, the gate! Come on! Quick! Cut him off, Ale! Keep your distance, Ale. Good job, Ester! Take him to the horse, Ale! There! Take him to the horse! Come on, come on. Let him come from a distance! Well done, picador! Hold steady. You get better every year, boss! Did you see it fight that horse, Ale? Brave steer. Is It a keeper? What do you say? You're my foreman. It's a good steer. - Who do I get next? - Number 106. - The son of Salinera and Carambolo. - That's the one. Take care of that cold, Ale, it's windy. Thanks, bow. It's an ill wind... You're always looking at horses' balls. But also at mares' legs! A horse is a horse... Horses understand language! My Napoleon speaks English since he was a colt. He knows verbs, nouns... How do you say nouns? That's cause horses aren't stoners like all you damn Gringos! Go get some mezcal for yourself! This is the good stuff. Then ask your horse, what a noun is! Cheers! Sustantivo. Noun is Sustantivo in Spanish. Okay. Thank you honey. You see, Mr. Vet? You gotta study! Or do I have to teach you Spanish, too? You're gonna teach me, Gringo? More water? Good bull, good rider! Those are the bulls bred in this ranch, gentlemen! Well led to that horse. Ale. What do we do, Ester? Steel gray? Dapple gray... long tail. - 122. - Your turn now! Your turn, rancher. Go on. Pass my vest. - Hey, Ale! - Are you riding that one? Yes, pass me the lance. Come on, you're getting old! - Will you guard me? - Sure. Let's go then. All yours, rancher! Ready Mario? That's my man! Gate! Faster, Rebozo, faster! Cut him off, Ester! - Who took him down, Tomas? - Ester. - Did Juan blow it? - Yeah. Good job, Morito. - Thanks, can you take him? - Sure. I'm going to clean up. Sure. This couple rides like angels! Bravo! You got fucked. Stupidity ls contagious, man! This is the best place on Earth, Juan. Man I love what you've fucking done with this place. It's beautiful. What you and Ester have done. - Thanks so much. - Have you been drinking? Yeah a little bit. Is that cool? Yeah, sure thing. I'd like to ask you a favor, gather... A great day, rancher! - Congratulations. - Just a sec. Get all the boys and gather all the novillos and put them back in the paddock by age. Can you do that? - No casualties? All vaccinated? - All of them. Hallelujah! Get a drink, I'll be right with you, Manolo. So you want them all in the paddock by age then? Yes. Please do that. Wanna stay overnight for some weekend mezcal? The girls are staying, the family ls staying. Oh man, that so nice from you. I'd love to, but I'm gonna catch a ride to Mexico City with Ester. Is Ester going to Mexico City? Yeah, I think so. You're right. She told me that, she told me. Let's go for a drink. But next time I come back I'd love to get some beers and have a good chat with you about things. - The horse let you down, boss. - It let me down, Freddy. What do you think? Are we gonna get some rain soon? We need it you know. It's been about a month and a half that is hasn't come - I don't know whats happening. - Hopefully. - Rancher. - Girls Rum and coke? Thanks, Lupita. Nice one, Ester. Girls, how are you? Come join us, Phil. - Mezcal? - Sure. Can we have a word? I'm coming. Can you take care of the snacks? Blanquita, are you there? I just wanted to have a word about... What is it, Ester? Give me a second. Blanquita, are you there? I'm here, Ester. I'd like you to make dinner for the kids. And then get them to bed, can you? Sure, I can make them pizzas... ...with pita bread, cheese, and tomato. Warm up the lentils, the rice, and some carrots. The chorizo red pepper too. And get the little ones to bed early. The chorizo red pepper too. And get the little ones to bed early. We are heading there now. I'll put them to bed. There's also some curry... That's for the adults. Heat up the chorizo, make some sauce... Do you remember which one? Sure, the ingredients included... peppermint, potatoes... Who's that kid crying? Its Teyari's cousin, who's bothering the girls. He keeps spitting at them. So how do you want the sauce? First put an onion in the blender, add two teaspoons of turmeric, two of curry, add garlic and let it simmer half an hour. Then add two spoons of that yoghurt called kefir. Black Elk thought - no, he saw. because it was a vision - that his people. the Oglala Sioux, were in serious trouble. He saw this in a vision when he was nine years old. And in it, the powers arrived. The four elements, four colors. And each one bestowed on him a power, In the form of a wand. He had to use that wand... ...to move... the vision. And in doing so, to move his people. That same vision is what will make you... ...one, and related. We are one big family. Mitakuye oyasin. After I wrap up with the web page guy, I'm going to bed. I'll see Phil tomorrow, so he can teach me about the feed, and I'll be back as soon as possible. Let's leave It for tomorrow, honey. Anyone could walk In. You seem very excited about going to the city, What are you planning? Do you want a fantasy to jerk off? - Is it heavy? - Yes. What did you pack? - A dead body? - Surprise. Thank you. Phil. Oh, my back! There were some pills, with a train or an airplane on them. - What were they for? - So you wouldn't get carsick and throw up! Here goes! Hurry up, I have a meeting! - Come on, Lechera, need some help? - Sure. So, you're leaving with them? - Are you going too? - Yes, sir. How are you? Wow, your breath! Well, you know how it is! See you, Manolo. Lechera! Quit your sulking! Who are you, the president? See you! That's good, it'll hold. What do you say? Is it finally going to rain? - Didn't you hear the chachalacas? - You're always on about those birds. Do you wanna bet on it? Okay, Lechera, see you next time. Take care of this animal! I will, Phil. - I'll get the bridle. - Great. So my friend, what? Three weeks... Gonzalez? Yep, in three weeks... - ...with Gonzalez. - How many horses are you gonna do? I think 8. He doesn't have more than 10. - Okay. - Yeah. He's kind of an asshole, though... Gonzalez? You will find out, but... Yes, he Is a puckered... ...asshole, but made of gold. - Gold. right! - So. work your ass off... do a good job. Okay? Okay, my friend. Juan, I just want to tell you thank you so much for getting me all this work, it really means a lot to me. And I love being here. Thank you so much. We're coming! - Sorry friend. - That's all right Take care. - Have a safe trip back. - Yeah, I will. - Goodbye. I'll see you guys. She has to go to Mexico City. Work is work, Juan! - Can you open the gate for them? - Sure. Good play. Now you'll have it. Hi, honey. Hi, Ester. How was it? The websites looking very good, love. He's really good, and the bulls will look great. What about the drive with Phil and the vet? The vet was kind enough to throw up in the ear and pass out. Phil is really funny for a Gringo. For a Gringo? Or he's really funny, period? I don't know. We laughed all the way... ...I'm going to his place now so we can get a head start with the work, so I won't have to do it tomorrow. At midnight? It's 11:15. He says he's not an early riser. Alright. gorgeous, but don't stay up too late. It was actually his idea! That way I'll get home earlier tomorrow, don't you think? Why's that one so riled up? Number 180? Isn't that the one that fought the black bull? Son of a bitch. Get it with your slingshot! Here you go. It'll just piss it off. Who cares! Go on. - Should I? - Yeah, go on. It'll be okay. They're heading this way! Get on the cart, Buddha! Steady. Don't move. It's coming! Hold on tight. Buddha! Get up, it's coming! Throw something at it! Throw a bale at it! Throw something at it! Throw something! Buddha! The hammer, Buddha! Buddha, come back! Buddha! Hello, Gaspar! Hello! - Hi sweetie, can you get the gate? - Yes, Mom! - Thanks. - Sure, Mom. Ester! ...not just one or two, every time you're in there, with the bulls. I agree, you can't be too careful. - Accidents can happen. But I agree. - You can't be too careful! Agreed. And you guys have to be more responsible! Coming to work drunk or hung over, when you have to feed the bulls... ...you can't come to work. So if these guys come in... without their wits about them, drunk or hung over... A wild bull is unpredictable on the range, so you can't come to work drunk, wasted, or hung over... Listen to him, son. Yes, yes. Alone at last, honey. Yes. Shoo, bunny! I'll throw the cat on you. So, did Sara tell you about this morning? She mentioned something. And? She said everything's okay... Is that what Sara said? Everything's okay? I must have misunderstood. It's not okay, Ester! A bull killed a mule and we're lucky it didn't kill a cowboy, too. That's so dangerous! What were they up to? "Dangerous"? Damn right, "dangerous"! "What were they up to"? Feeding the bulls. Ester! The same as every damn day! It was just a question. A question implying there's someone to blame. - Hi Mom. - Hi Juanito. What's up? Are you in a bad mood, love? What a question! What do you think? That mule was a hard worker! Now I'll have to buy a new one, train it... Should I be opening a bottle of champagne? Or drinking whiskey. or what? Walt, Juan. I want a word with you. Juan! It was "The Ant," Ester. You used to ride her so often when we got here. What's up with you? - I'm sorry. - Come here, sweetie. You're right. Poor "Ant." I'm so sorry. Let's spend the day together. I missed you guys. I gave the mule to the cowboys, but they couldn't even find meat in the head to make a taco. What a shame. Come on. Come on, pal. Let's go home. "So" what? I'm going to miss you. You're leaving in a week? Yup. ...winter's over... - ...rugby, over. - Right. I told everyone you made the first team, Juanito. Who gives a shit, Mom? Hey, temper! ...I'll be here. Let's have a word. I'll be right back. Walt up, Juanita. What? - Are you glad Mom's back? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. What is it? You smell bad, dad. What do you mean, I "smell bad, dad"? Where do you get that from? So what do I smell like? Where do you get that from? So what do I smell like? Like poop. Hey! What do you mean "like poop"? Who's taller? Measure it. - What's up with him? - It must be the end of the holidays, he doesn't want to leave. He's in love. With whom? With a girl who'd prefer him to the dunce she's with now. Lorena. How about a jump? And then home. - Okay. - Okay? We'll be there in a bit, sweetie. So? So? Was it a good fuck last night? What are you on about? Don't get started, Juan. Kisses? At least... Well... ...a couple. A couple. Is that two? Or one of your "couples"? Enough, Juan. Just tell me. A couple. Your face looks sore, you know? Phil? What did he say or what? That he loved my body, and he asked if he could touch me. It's like a telenovela, you're nervous. - I'm not. It was just a game. - Do you like him? Come on! We drank and got wasted. That's all. I'm starving. Let's go have breakfast. Are you in a hurry? Let's hope next time you'll tell stories more spontaneously, right? Come on, enough. I'm... I forgot something, you go to breakfast. I won't be long. - Don't be long. - I'm going to the bull ring. I'm not going to the concert. Go with Michelle. I mean Thursday. Let's talk it over. - Hurry up. - I won't be long. Finally, let me point out that... ...there are very few timpani concertos in the history of music. And today I will be conducting the National Symphony Orchestra in the presence of the composer, which is also unusual, for obvious reasons! But we are especially fortunate because in addition to the gifted Gabriela Ortiz, two other talented women are with us this evening: my dear Ester Zavala. Who is sitting in the audience, and on stage, Gaby Jimenez, whom you are about to see perform. Ester is the wife of a lifelong friend. He could not be with us today. This morning he had to travel to Canada. Today, the Griffin Poetry Prize was awarded to Juan Diaz! Juan will not go anywhere to pick up a prize, will he? You know him well, Michelle. I know our husbands, you can't get them off their damn ranches. I'm so glad to be here, Est. Me too. Thank you. Why not today? I'm dead. How about tomorrow on your way to the ranch? It's always better in daylight. Yes, Phil. I'm still floating. I'm swimming. I hope I get some sleep. I know you will. See you tomorrow, Phil. See you tomorrow. Come on, Carlota. You won't find it in your phone, Juan. Focus on your own shit, Lechera. Come on. Here are some tracks of the bastard. Take a good look, man. How old are they? They're fresh! I wouldn't mention it otherwise. - Is it alone? - Yes. You go up and look for it, I have to make a call. - I'll see you down there. - Okay. Ester? Ester, can you hear me? Ester? Hello, handsome. It's just been a day and I already miss you. Me too. How was the concert? Details when I get back, but it was amazing. Before it started, Carlos raved about you to the audience. I heard. My mother sent me the reviews. Good old mother-in-law doesn't miss a beat! Honey, one more thing: You know, I'll be late because I need to see Santiago again. He wouldn't stop crying and asked me to stay. You're right, that baldie's a real crybaby. Weren't you with him all morning? He'll find another girlfriend, tell him to chill out. No, no. But I'm definitely not going to Canada. See you in the afternoon, then. Say hello to Santiago. I love you too. Goodbye. Come here, baby. Come here. Rebozo come. Come here. Calm down, Rebozo. It's okay, easy! Rebozo! What's wrong with the horse, Juan? Steady, Rebozo. I don't know, he's acting strange. Sure it isn't you? What? The one who's nervous. Where's the stud? At the hilltop with two cows and won't come down. Really, no way? No! What do you mean, "no way"? No, no. Tie him to your dick but bring him down tomorrow! We'll bring some cows so it comes down. Sounds good. Come on, man! Are we leaving, Juan? No, man. We can set up a tent if you want! Damn it! Here's your damn water, Lechera! I told you it would rain! You say that every day, It had to come true. Right? Why do you think I brought the slickers? So you can cover my dick? Look! Your scourge ls back. Hey, honey! You'll get drenched! That's the whole point! I don't remember much. Don't you? Were the older girls there? Wong. the fat one. I think so. How was your day, honey? I managed to do some writing. Dad, can you pass the chocolate? Thanks. I'm glad, love. Did Santiago feel better? Yes, he'll be fine. It really helped that I stayed with him all day. - I'm going to go read. - Give me a kiss. Goodbye, Juanita. - Sleep well. - You too. Kiss the kids goodnight. Good night. Good night. You too, kids. Time for bed. - I'll read you a story. - Okay. Can I? Do you want to? - Yes. - Do you want Dad to read to you? Sure. - Let's go, guys. - I don't care which of you reads to us. Give me a kiss, Gaspar. - Sleep well, sweetie. - See you tomorrow. Let's go, my dear. We'll now read a story, and then to sleep, right? Let's read a good one. Last night's was awful. Put your pajamas on. I'll be right back. - I won't be long. - Sure. When you left I had breakfast and stopped crying... Life can be hard sometimes. right? But overall, it's wonderful. Wouldn't you say? Overall... Lights off? Lights off. Sometimes one can do terrible things. Thanks for driving me to the airport, Dad. I hate getting up so early, but I want to spend every last minute with you. Me too. I miss you at school. Would you rather not go? I really like it. When things don't go your way, let it flow. It will all get back on track and you'll regain control. Have you really done something terrible, Dad? I'll tell you when It's over. Why do you want to do this behind my back? What, Juan? I know you weren't with Santiago all afternoon. Just tell me why, and we can drop it. So where was I? Stop it, Ester. You have 17 calls from Mr. P. On my way back I drove to the ranch where Phil's working. We went to a hotel. Then I drove home as quickly as I could. Why didn't you tell me? I was waiting for things to settle down. How would things settle down if we don't talk? Give me a hug. You've never spied on me before. You'd never lied to me before. Cut off the calves! Here's the stud. Stay with the cows, Ernesto, stay with them! Wait for me with the bulls, Juan! I'll wait for you here! Come on, kids! Why don't you wave to your dad? I won't cause he makes me go to school. Come on, Gaspar! Say hello, kids! Paz. How are you? - Honey. - How are you? We're talking about the parties we used to go to. If you go out, you have to make it count. - Otherwise, what's the point? - Sure. They went to a great event in Chapultepec castle. That's wonderful. Yes. - Blanquita, pass me my beer, please. - Sure. Thank you. And tacos, please. I'm not having any fruit. How are you doing? Not bad, Paz. How's the construction going? It's going... ...more or less. Okay. I'll leave you two. - Will you pick me up? - Sure. See you soon, I'll be waiting. - We'll go together, neighbor. - Fine. Honey, I'll see you in a while. Okay. So, tell me... Well, things are always a bit unreliable around here. The man who was meant to deliver materials said to me, "I didn't mean to let you down... I just had to." One thing or another, the job never gets done. Was that Porfirio? I love you. Me too. And how's it all going? What do you mean? Ester, I don't want a police report, but you agreed to let me know... if you'd been in touch, if you think about him, If it's over... You're pathetic, Juan! Why do you talk like that. Ester? Where's all this coming from if nothing's happened? - Well, that's what I'm asking. - Well, now you know! Ester, you're texting all day long. - Don't treat me like an idiot. - What do you want me to say? That he wrote 3 times, asking if his wallet was in the car, and how was I doing, and when I could return the wallet. So I told him that it was in the car, and that I had a bad night. It's all so stupid, isn't it? Can't you understand something so elementary? I do understand. But you could've said all that In a friendly manner. Why would you lie and hide things? Who's lying, and what is being hidden? Who? You. What? Your feelings. You could have just said, "we've been in touch," "it's all up in the air, I'll let you know." Why should I say things In your words? Not in my words. It's an example of civilized conversation Okay, that's all right. All right. You're such a pain! Who is being a pain. Ester? Who's a pain? Could this have been handled better, yes or no? With better communication? Could be. Could be... ...that a dog has 3 assholes, could be. Juan! Juan! I'm coming! - Juan. - How are you? I came to ask if you want me to move the steers. I asked you hours ago! It's too late now. Do it with Buddha tomorrow morning. Okay. Tomorrow it is. Do you have a cold? Why would you ask me that? 'Cause you look bloated. Bloated are my balls, man! That's my wife's gift for the day. And how do you and Lourdes get along? Lourdes is easygoing, but she's told me about that stuff. - About what stuff? - About the ladies, man! ...'cause in the dining room It's so noisy. Everyone's talking like: But you can only hear one voice at a time. That's true. That's absolutely true. You're going to grow ears like this and a nose like... Well, I know everything. What is it? I don't want to exercise today. Stay home and rest, love. I have to take the kids to school, so I'll go anyway. Let Lechera take them. Enjoy life. Live a little. ...they injected him a drug and now every time he sings... He's as crazy as me. Why get pissed off, just 'cause I mention there's someone to help? I'm not feeling good. I didn't sleep well and I have a headache. You can count on me for whatever you need. Thanks. What is it, then? Can you answer me, Ester? I just told you, I don't feel well! - But why are you angry? - I'm not angry! But now I see everything you said about love, about not believing in possessiveness, about me fucking anyone but never leaving, and you not being afraid... It's all a fallacy! The issue is you started it all with a lie, Ester! I told you everything, Juan! No you didn't. because I caught you first! We are not in Esterland, damn It! I was waiting for things to settle down, I told you! You just said you told me everything! And what's the deal with your phone? You don't even let go of it to take a shit! I work at a ranch, in case you hadn't noticed! I get 20 emails and 100 messages per day! You won't shut up! Leave me alone! Enough! Leave me alone. How am I not leaving you alone? Phil hasn't called or written! It all went down the drain before it began. And I'm sick of depressed people who don't let others sleep! I do let you sleep. I'm not depressed, it's just not celebration time, is it? Ester! I ask you a question and you answer with an attack. Why do you leave in the middle of a conversation, Ester? Ester! Juan, someone's looking for you. Who is it, Blanca? Remember I told you about my cousin, Lalo? I'm coming. Well... ...maybe you won't agree to this favor I'm about to ask. Don't ask me, then. Well it's... I do want to ask, but... what if you say no, and... Out with it, Lalo. Look, I came here to ask... ...if you'd sponsor me with a car, since you go to Mexico City. I thought you could sponsor me with an old car from there. What do you mean, sponsor you? Well, could you buy me a car? What do you mean, buy you a car? You see, I race old cars in Huamantla. I need another car 'cause I flipped mine over, so I thought... What exactly do you want from me? Well, I want you to sponsor me with a car so I can install my other engine. - So you want me to buy it? - Yes. That's what I said about a sponsorship and that's why I knew you wouldn't want to. How much are we talking about? I don't know, maybe 50,000 pesos. At last, on that windy and sunny day, Juan Diaz opened his eyes. As Ester's words kept beating under those spoken by Blanca's cousin, Juan understood the obvious: his wife's desperation had nothing to do with her marriage. The only thing that hurts her is her lover's absence. After saying goodbye to Lalo, Juan remembered his own a dozen years earlier: the woman whom he then loved so deeply tried in vain to sleep by his side. While he already knew that his desire for another woman had become overpowering, and would end up destroying everything of beauty that he had built in his life. Juan remembered how, amid that insufferable agony, he couldn't help smiling by the simple act of uttering Ester's name in his mind. And he remembered how, while that other woman suffered nights of insomnia, he slept as soundly as if he were on a lunar stone: instantly and all through the night. He, dirty traitor, swine, son of a bitch. We're coming. Yes. - Lenora? - What? Are you afraid of your dad? Yes, you are. Ester's pain will become hatred. It's preferable to take the risk: Juan has decided to call the horse breaker and warned him to treat his wife well for some time. You opened the door Phil, now you'll have to come in. I did want to go. Me too. So why didn't you invite me? She gets real jealous, the bitch. I know, but I had spare time. Alright, come in. That's it. My little buck. That's it. I'm going to climb on now, okay? So steady. Dear Phil, You're not playing any games by not saying anything to Ester, you are only fulfilling an obligation to me motivated by your disloyalty. If you had the balls to fuck her behind my back you'll have them to keep quiet and continue what you've started. In response to your letter, I'd like to point out two things: Your aforementioned disloyalty and my love for my wife. Even if she told you not to worry about our relationship, you should've still been loyal to me. Someone more manly would've said: "It would be a pleasure to have sex with you," "but I won't do it because you're Juan's wife" "and I have much to thank him for." "Either way I will first consult with him." Regarding my love for Ester, if we would agree to define love as a perpetual collaboration for the freedom and fulfillment of the loved ones becoming. Then, what is it that unites us as equal adults? Is there a factual possibility for love till death do us part? Are possession and absolute boundaries compulsory? In the case of my marriage, if I allow or even lay the table for Ester to have a passionate relationship with you. Do I place our love at risk? Not only of losing her to you. Which I believe still to be a remote possibility. But as a result of this new sexual condition, could this ultimately lead to the annihilation of our love? Cuckolded couples are meant to have an obligation to put an end to such a scenario. But, what is achieved by this? A failure in such an attempt and a continuation in secrecy? Or successful arrestment of the affair that may lead to frustration and a life long accumulation of resentment? As I do not have clear answers, I prefers to force things forward. My regards, Juan. Good one. Good one. Good one! How's it going? All good? - See you later. - Yes. So. Santiago To cut a long story short, I went to South Africa for 3 months, to take photos, and when I got back, she was dating someone else. She said she'd got lonely. What did Ester say? We talked. She helped me. It was helpful to talk to her. Do you think if your friend... was in the same situation... she would also leave me? No, Juan, you two are In another world. What world is that? Your bulls, your house, your kids, It's another world. If that's what keeps us together I'd rather be separated, brother. Half distance please. And then further. Okay. Good one. Well done, Sergio. Have you ever thought about... ...how butterflies come along in summer, lay their eggs, and then leave? That's what's happening to you guys. But this is a great lesson for you. Right? Where do you find all that wisdom? What self-help book is it? - It's all me. - What lesson do I need to learn? Do you want the truth? As your friend, or as an outsider who's speaking the real truth? - As an outsider, right? - An outsider, go on. I'll tell you. You always want to be on top of everyone: in ranching, "I'm Juan. the ace, the fucking best." "I control everything." But guess what? My dear, that's not how things work. You don't control anyone. Can you tell me, who have I ever been on top of? Do you remember Orsa? Sure I do, that goof... I'm drunk, but I'm not an idiot. I remember him. What about Orsa? What about him? You behaved like Stalin with him. You were a real asshole, you berated him in public, It's your arrogance! That guy's the king of spectacle bullfighting. I have my own ideas about a bull's appearance and behavior, and I speak my mind. If that makes him look like an idiot, so be it. I never mistreated him. Was I unfair? He's a hard-working guy with years of experience, you mistreated him... - "Years of experience"? - ...It's your arrogance, brother. Being hard on people is a character flaw... This one's hard! Don't be a snob. But I've never... ...been unfair to anyone. Fucking Stalin? Have you been watching the History Channel lately? Gentlemen. - You don't even know who Stalin is! - Of course I do! - Who? - A mean motherfucker like you! I'm going to the restroom. You're a jerk. She's aged like fine wine, truly. What a beauty! I can't deny it. It makes up for everything that's going on. Yes, it does. I think so. I hear you. Does the fucking Gringo... ...give her tempered steel? What a moron. You ask her. No that's your problem. You ask her. You're the one who's asking. So, when was the last time? Four... five years ago. But... ...it would be my pleasure! Have you two calmed down? Well. I was just telling Juan... ...that I couldn't blame a lover like you. Yes, I'm drunk. but... ...it's understandable. - So what's your friend's name? - Pepito. Did you hear that? Pepito! Well... ...I understand that he can't resist such a queen. - Cheers. - Cheers. Juanita, go get yourself an ice cream, or something. We're all friends here, right? - I'm going to get a gin and tonic. - Please! You guys are crazy. - A gin and tonic? Okay! - I'll see you later? Seriously. I'll see you later. I hope so. I'll just take a walk. Okay. Good luck, my friend. Have fun. So, what do you say? He wants to get close to me even if it's through a stand-in. Then we'd better make him a video. I just stayed to have a glass of wine. You only do Gringos now or what is it? What do you say? Well, it's part of the show. Exactly. - Or you've forgotten? - Kind of. Come here. You're just as beautiful as ever. - May I? - Yes. Wow. As beautiful as ever. Alright then. Let's do justice to the night! What do you think? It won't close but... no one's watching. It's only natural for a young writer to use words in a straightforward manner, like everybody else, to convey his thoughts. Feelings, desires, memories, and pain. But it's not until he discovers that words can be used inversely than the usual way that a new language is born: Using words to see. Thus, poetry becomes a tool of knowledge because language takes on a different form, as a beacon of words. In the words of the late American poet Mark Strand: I have a key so I open the door and walk in. It is dark and I walk in. It is darker and I walk in. Forgive me for stopping. But I'd like Juan to read the next part, because it's so lucid, and your words will sound better in your own voice. Thank you, Isabel. Hello, honey. How's everything? The congress went better than I expected. How are you feeling, love? Can you hear me? ...been throwing up, as If I were pregnant. And your mood? Yesterday I hated going out You used to love that, right? Yes. It will come back. Have you been to see the homeopath? Yes. I want this morning. He gave me pills and some herbs. I'm sure you'll feel better soon. I wish I could see you. Sybille, the German woman, was very good. The Ukrainian intellectual was boring and superficial. Then I ate with the moderator and came back to the hotel. Then I ate with the moderator and came back to the hotel. You look beautiful. That shirt suits you. Can you show them to me? You're a bit off-center, gorgeous. Shift to the center. A bit to your left, to your left. That's it. Have you been horny? Fuck, Juan! I just told you I feel sick, I can't stand the bulls, I'm tired of being with the kids, and you're asking if I'm horny? What is wrong with you? Whenever I'm away I ask you that, and it's always been a bridge... I'm not always feeling this sick, though! I get it, you feel sick, I just don't think it's only physical. The other issue clearly has an effect, Ester! The other issue has nothing to do with the nausea of menstruation. Isn't it easier, Ester to admit that you're in love? I am not in love! For fuck's sake, Juan! I'm going through something personal! Leave other people in peace! Is this how you like them, Juan? Do they turn you on like this? Are they centered enough? Answer Mel Do they turn you on like this? My love, As I told you by e-mail, today is the first day in weeks I've felt some clarity. The nausea is almost gone now. It came from a huge buildup of tension, which I was unable to process logically. It got stuck in the pit of my stomach. Today I finally ate something after a three-day fast, and it gave me strength. I spent the day with the cowboys and the kids, nowhere near the computer. I didn't want to deal with any paperwork. I did some gardening with Lechera and arranged tableware with Blanca, focusing entirely on physical work. I reconnected with the beauty of our house, our home, the poplar-dotted plains you love so dearly, the transient clouds that offer glimpses of the sun, clear or veiled, and our bulls, which are like vases of silver and lava, as you say. I felt blessed and gave thanks for the life I live. Phil called late last night and we spoke about the situation. Hes working out his relationship with his girlfriend. He has been working with some difficult horses and he hinted that someone had told him what to do with me. He was vague, and I didn't say much. We didn't talk long because he was exhausted of breaking. Please tell me if you discussed this with him. I got that distinct impression. I realized that we've attached too much importance to this. You're suggesting that my problem is that I've fallen in love. I think that this episode with Phil, which could have been with any other man, unleashed something that I have felt for a long time. I will write straight from the heart. I'm still processing and none of this is clear yet. During these 15 years I've been driven by that initial burst. The force that let me to you was so powerful, that I could see eternity with you, my destiny fulfilled with you. There was nothing else. Nothing but giving you my love, so that you would also see me. I know that you were were fighting your own battle. We each waged our own fight to be together This has all been a continuous flow for me, In which I had to prove myself so you wouldn't leave me. Or even worse, so you wouldn't think that leaving Paula had been a mistake. That was my all-encompassing purpose. Then, the birth of our children made everything even more intense. They transformed me, for better and for worse. At than point, I stopped recognizing myself. I no longer knew who I was. I kept on going, driven solely by my love for you. Then, we moved to the ranch and I found it so hard to achieve a sustained sense of fulfillment We began to quarrel, and although I finally felt that you were with me, I had lost my strength. I wasn't strong enough for the life I was leading, because I hadn't processed any of it. Simultaneously, what we experienced was so beautiful with such depth and love in our relationship, that our love became stronger and finally welded. But as is turned out, there was a fracture underneath. The quarreling consumed us to the point that for the first time I saw our love outside myself, as an independent being. I realized then that after losing the force that had driven me for years, I was empty. I had unknowingly built something in those years I had become a different woman. I felt the need to broaden my horizons, also for the first time. but I'd forgotten how. This event with Phil, triggered a need to experience things on my own terms. Not out of love for you or our children. And when this event led to a collision between us I caved in again. The effects on our marriage are much more powerful than the event itself. The event is trivial. It lasts barely a couple of weeks and turns into a memory, just another experience. Yet, its effects on us have been profound. I am convinced that it is largely positive. For the first time in our lives together all your words to me have been deeply kind and loving. And for the first time since I set eyes on you, I have started to think of myself. Both developments will enable us to grow. You are the love of my life, and I've never doubted that for a second. Perhaps things are still unclear and my words sound superficial, Gradually I will understand more fully, and I will do so by your side. How fortunate I feel to listen to you every day. Ester. I understand you're coming to break Jimenez's colts, and that you'll stay at the ranch, Phil. I know that Ester has made plans with you. Don't worry about me. I rented a house nearby for a few days. I don't want to stay at the ranch and I don't want a thing to do with Ester. I think what is most important Is that she comes out of this one unhurt. It's a shame she wants to live this experience without you instead with the three of us. As I've tried to talk her into many times. I think Ester needs the last word on this event. I don't know why she's lying and wants to keep me out at all costs. Best case scenario, she needs to assert herself. In an intermediate case, she wants revenge on me. In the worst of cases, her desire is so strong that she truly loves you. This time I must let her be. Love is resilient, and above all... Imperfect. I've learned a lot from you along this route, Juan. I'll be with Ester for a few more weeks and then it's goodbye. Now let's enjoy the mezcal we promised ourselves so long ago. They're here. I have money... you have no money... Bon appetit. Join us, Juanito! Come here. Where are you going? What's up? Nothing much. So, what's up? What about? Won't you kiss me? - Let's go... - Where to? - Stop it, Juan. - Stop what? See you, Juan! We are leaving. We are leaving, Juan. See you. Carlos. Have a good one. Bernie. Don't go. Stay here. Can I take my dog? Totally... ...your dog, my dad, your brother... Is it any good? - It's amazing. - Juanito. - We'll be right back. - Okay. Why don't you go with Phil to the cabin? No, no way. Go on. Just for a while. C'mon. Juan! You're nuts. You know you want to. Thirty minutes. Where do you get these ideas? Go on! You're so insistent, Juan! Do you want to, or not? Go on. Okay, half an hour. Go on. But you fuck Michelle, okay? We'll see. Are you okay? - I'm great. - Really? Great? Excellent! Your turn. Too much coke for a cock. It will, it will come. Juan! Hey, man. Hey, man. Hey, man. Hey, man. Hey, man. Years ago, I saw that same expression on you, Ester. The way you used to look at me, the way you felt. When I saw you just now, it all came back to me. It came like it was yesterday. Although now it was for someone else. Right now, I'd give everything I am, to see that look again, even if only... ...minutes. I guess that many men who catch their wives in the act with someone else. See and hear something that's never been given to them. Then they realize that they were never loved. But what I saw, is a lot more complex. I know every millimeter of that look, of that expression. It simply... ...left me. Are you whispering to your horse? No, man. Come on, Juan. Man, don't be such a fucking idiot. You don't realize what it is that you guys have here together. The way you communicate, it's beautiful. Yeah, are you gonna cry? Just listen how she talks non-stop. Enough! What a temper! Ready to talk now? Orale, man. You've made it. Finally. Man, you are seriously the greatest couple I've ever seen in my life. Where's Ester? She's gone, brother. It's all muddy. Yeah. Don't worry. Don't ride too close to the edge. She's right. His shoes are all wet now. Yes. I can see them from here. When you get too comfortable you lose your inspiration, right? Could be. Who said that? Our English teacher told us about this guy... ...Joseph Conrad. He had the same problem as you: when he got too comfortable he couldn't find inspiration, but when things were bad, everything was just fine. "This guy, Joseph Conrad..." Come here. Sit down. I wouldn't want your tidy clothes In a mess, now. I can't tell you how happy it makes me to see you growing up. Will you give me a hug? I love you, and Mom too... so much. Leave the house for a few months... Do what you want Hi. Hi, love. How are things? Fine. Are you going to The Valley to see Pablo tomorrow? Yes. I'm afraid he's on his way out. I miss you. I miss you too. Wait for me in bed. Come here. We'll tell the children you went on a trip... Show me your body. Sure. But let's not fuck tonight. Please, Juan. Whenever you're ready, love. Thank you. At my mother's funeral, my arm started hurting, a month ago so I saw a doctor, 'cause it was hurting bad. Who told me it was nothing, just psychosomatic. Three days later I went back, 'cause I couldn't move my arm and the doctor said the same thing. But then another doctor saw me, and decided on the spot to run some tests. That's when they found the tumors. Eight in my body and three in my head. They said there were no options, chemo or whatever. So we decided to quit all that shit. And here we are, eating mud and live insects, and we're getting married next week. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - We don't want any gifts. - I won't give you any. Let's be silent for a while, please. At this moment, Juan felt overwhelmed by a sense of envy, an immeasurable envy. Not malicious or mean-spirited. He simply wished he were Pablo Fendol, a condemned man, full of love. Juan felt a sense of discomfort, awe, perhaps dread. Pablo instead, smoked drugs, believed in the Buddha and the Prana, in good vibes and the power of love, surrounded by his friends and his devoted fiancee. Juan was overcome with loneliness, when he realized that he would not feel the same if he were in Pablo's place. He sensed his indifference for all gods, miracles and magicians. he felt the terror of not knowing who would keep him company and make him feel a peace, like Pablo had. He thought or his wife and children: She was deep in a cave, and who knew if she would ever emerge from it. And Juan sensed that even if she did, she would never give herself as fully as his friend's wife. His children would be scarred by such an early death. He sensed that his parents and siblings could annoy him, rather than soothe him. As for his friends, he hoped they would be there for him... ...but then he realized that they may all be too busy. Juan wondered if he'd last until the end or take his own life, but he know that his attachment to life was too great and he would die suffering. All this went through Juan's mind after traveling 100 km to The Valley to see his friend Pablo Fendol, on his death bed. - Good afternoon. - Afternoon. We been thinking that this doesn't make sense anymore, I am convinced that we have to separate. Ester, I thought the same thing yesterday, I wrote you a loving letter last night... Yes! ...saying... - Exactly! - ...Ester! I cannot be with you. You want to be worshipped and I can't do that. I just can't. - Ester, please... - No more games. Juan! Do you want a divorce? We're doing it tomorrow! - But I need to be with the kids, so let's... - Can we discuss this later? I can't give you what you need! What do you mean 'what I need', Ester? I can't take your pressure anymore, Juan! Thais enough, let's talk at home. Okay, okay. Goodbye. Excuse me? Excuse me? What is It? I have a big question. What's that? I have a big question. Go ahead. Weren't you on television last Sunday? - Yeah, sometimes I do that crap. - I watched you! - You watched me? - Yes. - You keep a fine garden. - Thanks. - Is it all your work? - Yes, all of it. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Juan. - Jose Manuel. It's a pleasure. - I'll join the others now, see you. - Yes. Hi, Juan. Juan, this is Miguel. Miguel, Juan. Are you alright? Juanito, always so emotional... Carry on, carry on. It's not because of you, Pablo. It's not you. In a month this guy will be back on a football field. You'd never been in a crash since I've known you. No, wait for the insurance guy. I'm heading home, I'll be with the kids and wait for you there. Yes. When you get home I'll read the letter, and I promise to have a civilized conversation then. Goodbye, love. My dear Ester, There are two boats before you, but one has already sailed. You are freed because Phil has left, which makes it easier for you to return to the old ship berthed at the dock. I'd prefer if Phil were here and you still chose to come back to me. If you do come back, it must be your choice. - Do you want a knife and fork? - No thanks. But since Phil is gone, you must be certain that whatever happens is your own decision rather than a twist of fate. How will you be sure? Would you like to leave home for some time? My life without you is sad and gray, but I refuse to live half a life. Come here, love. Thank you. So? At the beginning I spent years struggling in silence. Now you're unable to deal with my process. Forgive me. I'm almost there. I don't remember. So how do you know they bothered you? Because I remember they did. And what should you do if someone bullies you? What do you say, Gaspar? - What do you think? - Well... ...we shouldn't hit them. Why not? Because that's bad. But what does your dad always say? That we should hit them. True or false. Lenora? Tell the truth! False! Have I said that, Juan? Well... What did I use to say? - ...you said... - False! No, it's true. No, it's not! - Did it work? - I've never been in a fight, so... Not true. not true! Let your brother speak! What was that? I've never been In a fight. so... - ...I've never had to. - Me neither! My dad always says "Hit them! You hit them!" What do I say, Lenora? Be honest. It's true, 'cause you always say to Gaspar: "If someone keeps bullying you, hit them and hit them again." But how many chances should they have? Three. But when she really bullies me, you say "Hit him real hard this time. Really hard." Dad, you know how when someone...? Are you crying, Mom? I just got a drop of lemon in my eye, sweetie. - See you later. - Bye, Juanito. Time for school, kids. Say bye to mom. - Can I take one? - Yes. Have a good day at school. Who's taking us, Dad? - Don't forget the tangerines. - I won't. - It's just Juan and me for breakfast. - Okay. - Have a good day. - Thanks dear. What did you want? Should we go riding today? Sure. Great. Ester, can you give me a second? I dreamt that you and Phil insulted me. I've been left out of this all along. You pulled all the strings. Fucking bastards. - Where's my coffee, Blanca? - On the counter. - Thanks for saving it. - No problem. Where should I leave the keys? Which keys? The ones to the truck. - Let's see... Why do you have them? The Gringo brought them. Can you turn that off? - When was he here? - This morning. Did Ester greet him? No. I went to the door. But I told her that he'd been here. I see, Blanca. Thanks. Oh, he left a message: He said he'd call later, he wanted to thank you. - Great, Blanca. - Sure. Our Time.
