Sorry, you're busy. - Only half a day. - Sorry. I can't. Hey, move, you idiot! What the hell do you think you're doing? Out of the way! Can you hear me? Get out! Why did you do that? What's your reason? My family is dead and you're responsible for their deaths. It was an order. It's easier said than done. General, urgent call. - Take her away! - Lord. Yes? General, everything went well. Harrison he's in Bangkok now. So what's next? Take him to the base. Remember, treat him well. Yes, sir, I know what to do. < i>this information comes from very reliable sources. I want you to get Harrison. These people must be stopped. Gentlemen, did you hear, what are the instructions from above. It is clear that this we need to do this as quickly as possible. We can't let them attack., and remember, in this operation, the timing is very important. Be that as it may, we have to get Harrison. safe out, so we need to strike fast. Johnson will provide you with all necessary help, inspector. Do you have any questions? Mr. Johnson, I'd like you to he presented his plan in detail for this rescue mission. Our target is inside Burma's borders. The men you choose must be reliable, because we don't want to warn the Burmese government. No international incident. This drug lord kunsar is an old fox. You have to tread carefully. Our man will contact you, when you arrive. I've gathered all the information, so you can go through them. Oh, thanks. I think they'll help you. This rescue mission must be quiet. We informed the Thai authorities. They will assure us that they will provide you with support. With. Gentlemen, let's get this started. I'm afraid time is not on our side. - Good luck. - Thank you. Leave it! You don't have to take this. - You won't have time. - But, mom, I want it. I'll take … - Oh, don't be mad ... - ... Billy would love to see Disneyland, too. Dad? Can I take Billy with me? Of course, you can take whatever you want, okay? Thanks, dad. Hurry up. - I don't want to be late for the airport. - Hey, what's the rush? We still have an hour. Or are you afraid, that they could call from the precinct? You don't have to tell me, that it always happens. I can't believe we're on vacation., until we get on the plane. Hey, not this time. I promise you. I don't care what happens, let's go. All right. Just remember that. After all, this is the first time, after we really leave together. Don't worry, dear. It will be a great holiday, Disneyland and everything else. Let me tell you something, you can shop in Bloomingdale, then we can go. for a cruise on the Mississippi River. Or we can make love on the boat, if you like it? So what? Okay? Great, huh? Dad, what does it mean to love? ... Love them ... it is ... Oh, I'll take it! - Just let it ring! - No, that can't be it, okay? - Right? - Don't worry! Okay? Dad? Just be nice and I'll tell you, what does that mean later, okay? Be good. Hello? < i > this is lung. Oh, boss, not anymore! What is it this time? < i > bad news, I'm canceling your vacation. Um, what are you saying? Are you kidding me? I'm packed for the trip! Find someone else. I can't. It's a very important mission. < I > it's a top-down order. They want you to take care of it. Cancel your vacation and come back. OK. Okay, boss. Well, it happened again. Damnation. According to Interpol reports, Harrison is held in a small, remote village fifty kilometers from the Burmese border. And all the roads to and from the village they were blocked by kunsar. So we need a good plan. How about using helicopters? We can attack them from the air. That would alert the Burmese government. Except him, maybe they wouldn't cooperate. We have strict orders., that it must be done without problems. We have already informed the Thai government. They are willing to cooperate, assuming that minimal fuss. I contacted in Bangkok a man named Tun. They call him"Fixer." Give you all the support, which you will need. You will go to the Thai-Burmese border, a place called "Jungle 29". Ah ... we. That's kunsar's base. - How much time do we have? - Three days. And the men? You can choose men special forces. Hey, boss, why do you always pick me? Honestly, it's gonna be a jungle fight, right? The special unit is not trained for this. I need people who have experience. They are few and far between. But they do exist, don't they? All right, then. Find the files on the man she wants, okay? You're responsible. Lord. - Thanks, Chan. - You're welcome! Good luck, Peter. I'm sure you can do it. Thanks a lot. Hey, Peter, do I have a part in this case? You fool. It's all your fault. If you hadn't lost Harrison, it would never have happened. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay? Look, lady., it's not a simple case. - Besides, you're a woman, you know ... - What's wrong with me being a woman? I'm as good as you! Chauvinist pig! And I'm just as capable as you! Look, this mission is very dangerous., I just don't want to put you at risk. Look, I'm responsible for all of this. that's why I want to help. I want to do something, to redeem myself, okay? I ... - I feel it's my responsibility. - Okay ... Hey, inspector Chan! Don't you think, that I deserve a chance? Think about it. - Hey, Peter, please give me a chance. - Partake. Thanks, Peter. How about this one? - Not bad, huh? - No. Other. Okay, next. Wait. Can I look at this file? - Mei, give me a copy. - OK. Officer, copy, please. Wait. This one looks good. Hey, I think we can use it. He hasn't been seen in a while. Mei, find out where this man is. - All right, you got it. - And please do it quickly. The guy's a bit of a rebel. He doesn't take orders very well. Are you sure about him? He's gonna be tough. I'll take it. - Where is it? - It should be that house. That one? Stay here, I'll go check on him. Are you okay? Come on! Over there! This way! This guy wants to play hard, be careful. There he is! Hey! Let's go this way! Hey, we should go back. No. He could have other traps in there. Let's go! Hey!

What's a man like you doing in a place like this? I'm a cop, and I need your help, sir. Do something you're good at. If you help us, you will certainly be satisfied with the money. What if I say no? I'm not here to arrest you., someone else will. Then you get ten years. You'd better arrest me. Idiot, you'd rather die, before you cooperate with us? Stop! I take care of my men. So what do you say? You know everything about me. I know enough. - Who is she? - My assistant. Tell her to never tell me she wasn't pointing a gun in the face. Eat. What happened? Are you still mad at me? It's annoying.

You're lucky to have so a wonderful woman like Helen. He has his quirks. - Can't you tell the truth? - I can't stand your father ... Aunt, mommy always mentions Tom Cruise, who is he? Tom Cruise is a very famous movie it's a great way to get to know your friends and family. insensitive, like your father. Auntie, what is love? What does it mean to make love? Yayo, eat your food and I'll tell you later, okay? I don't believe you. You say that every time! Come on, try it. Yaya, come on, you have to trust your father. But he's not honest. Every time he says, that I'll see Disneyland, and America, we're never going there! You can't blame him. Your father is a very responsible man. And your father really loves you, Yaya! Listen, I promise you something. When your father and I finish our mission in Thailand, we can go to the zoo, okay? All right. What is a mission?
