That's the last of it. Do I get a hello? Hmm. Oh, wow! You hung those, huh? You wouldn't let me hang them. Kev help you get all this packed up for me? No, I'm perfectly capable of... Never mind. Uh, hi. - Hmm, you doing okay? - Yes. No. Maybe. You? Fine. Yeah. Well, I certainly didn't expect a pandemic and then a divorce, and the timing sure isn't good for me. For you? Really, Bill? This can't come as a big surprise. You haven't been in this marriage for a very long time. Yeah, no. No, it hasn't. It took both of us to get here, but you know what? I'm going to start over. Okay. Okay. I get it. Look, uh, where's Kev? Grocery store. Well, like it or not, we have a child together. I'm going to see him. Of course. This is between you and me. You can see Kev whenever you want, whenever he wants. He's almost 17, he'll come to you. Hmm. Listen, my friend Wanda is on her way over. Okay. Well, you know, I just wanted this to end on an okay note, but, uh... You take care. I just need you to be here for Kev. This isn't easy for him. Yeah, I know. I know. Look, you know, in spite of what's happened... I'm here for you and Kev, always. Can't pretend 20 years was nothing. All right. Close this. Hi. Hey. Hubby? Soon to be ex-hubby. For you. I'm really not in a very good place right now, Wanda. I know my friend. Just open it. I love it. I do. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Well, sit. Come and sit for a minute. You got somewhere to be? A hot date or something? You know that's not true. Okay, you know, the timing might be really off... or maybe it's perfect. I... I've been planning a road trip up north. Why don't you come with me? Oh, my goodness! I'm not up for a vacation. I've got Kevin to think about and it's a pandemic. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not thinking vacation. I'm thinking journey, in my RV, sort of a quest, like, Monty Python in the Holy Grail, kinda. You're serious. Yes, absolutely. And I have all these amazing places I want to show you. I bet your mom would stay with Kevin. Again, it's a pandemic. Yeah, but they'd be totally safe here. You wouldn't have to worry about them at all and his dad's close by. Don't remind me, though my mother thought he was a great catch. A great catch? Like a prize trout? Oh, sorry, it's... not a good time for jokes. It just sounded so archaic. Not archaic. I grew up in a small Midwestern town. It came with expectations for your daughter manual. That included grandchildren of course. Best part of all of this is Kevin. I envy you. Me? I know you, Mary Beth, but I don't really know you. I know what I see on the outside. You're calm... poised... supermom. I envy you. You're so self-assured and gutsy. I've forgotten how to be a... badass woman. Come on, I am. I bet there's still a badass inside there. I know there is and she's just itching to get out and go on a road trip. Oh, hey, you told me that you used to be a professional fashion photographer, right? Well, I pulled this off the wall from the Laundromat and I think... you ought to do it. A photography contest? Me, taking professional photos again? You are out of your mind. Oh, come on. Don't give me that I can't do it stuff. Of course you can and you should on our journey. What, are we we're heading to the set of a Vogue shoot? Oh, be open, Mary Beth. Have I ever stood you wrong? Okay, the 5k was something I thought you could handle. You did come in 25th. There were 26 runners. To be fair, I really don't like to run. It is all in the journey, Mary Beth. You got to trust me. You know, we may not find the Holy Grail, baby, but we'll have a hell of a good time looking for it. Come on, go pack a bag and call your mom. Okay. Uh, I'll do it! Yes! I'll... I'll do it! Yes! I'll pack my camera and see what happens. How did I let you into my life? Well, as your loyal and trusty delivery person, I did deliver about a package a day to you for over two months. Did you ever use all that toilet paper by the way? You said RV, I'll supply the toilet paper. It's the least I can do. I'm going to go get the RV ready. This is going to be so much fun. Wanda. - Yeah. - Thanks. For what? Just... thanks. I'll put this in your room for you. I still have no idea why you want to do this. Thanks, Kev. I'm thinking of this as me being brave, new beginning and all. Before Wanda burst into my life, it was like, I was swimming in mud, slowly, backwards, actually with very little oxygen, But then, she delivered this teapot from a long ago lover named Barbara and it was like I woke up. I felt alive again... and it made me realize that I had to get out of the mud. Wanda. You ready to rock 'n' roll? Hey, don't back out on me now. You know, I need this as much as you do. I'm getting there. I'm not really sure if I'm packing the right stuff. You know, you do realize we met because of all the various things that you purchased online when this pandemic started and that I delivered to you. I know. I did kind of get crazy. - I'll finish packing. You ready? - I'm always ready. I'll see you soon. - Wanda. - Yeah. I'm glad you were literally delivered into my life. Funny. At your service, ma'am, and right back at you. I'll see you soon. This is going to be so much fun. This could be a terrible mistake. Yee-haw! Barbara, look at where you started all those years ago. When you sent that teapot a few months ago, every memory came flooding back. London and then those weeks at Big Sur. What could have been? You and me. Hi, mom. Have you completely lost your mind? Oh, good morning to you too. Ugh, you do realize that this pandemic isn't over. Yes, of course I do. Why do you have a mask on? Because they say, a mask protects you. You're sitting outside on your patio, it's... it's going out among other humans that you put a mask on. I'm making a point. So why the hell would you go on a... Well, a vacation? It's not a vacation. Thanks for coming to stay with Kevin. Bill's going to be around, but says he'll be doing his own traveling. Oh, what does he think about your little adventure? I haven't told him, yet. I'm going to tell him tonight. Well, if he says okay then I'll come. Ma, you do know, I don't need his permission. I'm... Our divorce is final in a few weeks. I'm... I'm telling him. I'm not asking him. My mother is a combination of unbridled adoration of me. Her only child and undisguised judgment of me, her only child, but if you asked her, she doesn't have a judgmental bone in her body. I just have to say, I think this is a terrible idea. Mom, I would expect you to say nothing less. Well, I've got to get going. Lots to do. - See you tomorrow. - But... Bill, I'm just letting you know, so that you can check in on Kevin once in a while. Mom will be here. Kevin will be fine. Uh... A couple weeks. No plan. They'll survive. I know. This is so not me. Thank goodness. Mom! I left early. Thought I had better see you one last time in case you end up in the hospital or have some enlightening epiphany that changes you forever. Leave it to you to leap to the worst possible scenario. I'll be back. I... I just hope you find what you're looking for. You know, it's... it's not really a good idea to travel alone, especially for a woman. I'll do both and I'm not traveling alone. Oh, with who? Oh, it's a long story, but with Wanda, that delivery person that convinced me to do this. Oh, so you are traveling with a virtual stranger. Oh, my God, Mary Beth! What do you even know about her? Everything that I need to know. I am completely baffled by all of this. People get divorced all the time, but it doesn't mean that you should put your health at risk or start acting foolish. Foolish was putting my life on hold for 20 years. That was foolish. You know what? I'm not even going to talk to you about this. Have you been tested? Has this Wanda? Yes, and we're both negative, so stop worrying. I'm going to worry, it's my job. Speaking of jobs, Kevin... A food truck! - RV. - Uh-huh. Surprise! Hey, I'm Wanda, former delivery person, but you can call me, the navigator... or Wanda. Wanda... Wanda works. So, you must be her mother. Good job, mom! Uh! So what do you think? I love to take off on the weekend, so I just turned this into a food truck. Actually a soup truck and it pays the expenses. You know, I washed the whole thing before I came over here and then bugs on the freeway decided to die on my windshield. This Wanda, not exactly as I pictured her. Not like your usual friends. I know. Maybe that's why I like her. Kev, You and I, there? Yeah. Oh, I've slept here so many times. It's really comfy. I don't snore. Oh, and I, you know, I can sleep on the edge. I usually sleep like just on the edge. Actually here, sometimes, on his edge, I just sleep like this. You can have... Or you know what? Sometimes I can sleep in the driver's seat too because I'm really flexible. Just... I just do that like... You know, like this and just get into a really small ball, and then just like, you know... Right. Mom, take care and I'll call you soon. Don't let Kevin get away with anything. Oh, you... He would be hard-pressed to try to pull one over on me. Okay. Time to roll. I didn't think a lot of this through. Chalk it up to expect the unexpected and go with it. - So not me. - Hmm. Okay, isn't that the point, to try out a new you? Wear this. - Good vibes. - Yep. I don't know. I don't know Wanda. Is it supposed to sink through the cotton or something? Just put it on. Holiday Inn. How long do you think it'll take before she calls? About an hour. That's what I'm thinking. There you go! Ever pee in the forest? First time for everything. You know, when I was a kid... my mom used to put this pot in the back of the car for us kids to pee in when we were traveling. I prefer the woods. Did you know that boys still miss even when the hole is a foot wide and 12 inches away. I have a boy, remember? That's right. What? What's so funny? I love the added flair to your wardrobe. Oh jeez! It's part of my comedy routine. Beautiful, isn't it? Just freaking beautiful. Sure is. So tell me about this garden. You know, I sort of happened upon it one weekend a long time ago. I was traveling and got lost, pulled over at this cabin. Person who lived on the property took me for a walk through the garden. And it was this beautiful... peaceful, calming place. I thought it would be a great, new beginning for our journey. You know, something to get our heads in a different place. I've never asked you, but have you ever been married? Oh, no, no. I've had a few relationships with women, nothing super long term. Nobody broke my heart or anything... although, one or two came close. Women? Hmm. Come on, Mary Beth, you haven't figured that out by now? It didn't cross my mind. Wow! Just wow. Hey, I don't care or anything if that's what you're thinking... but you didn't think maybe I was... You? No. We're just two badass women on a mission, on an adventure, a journey. You and me? No. Well, that never crossed my mind. Wanda, this is absolutely gorgeous. I wasn't expecting this. Yeah, so this is the main house where the spiritual leader and his students I guess you call them, live. And then back there through, uh, that gate back there is, uh, gorgeous gardens like you have never seen, an orchard and everything. Oh, an orchard. I hope they have an orange tree. I think they do. You know what? I'm going to get us a pot of soup made, something, uh, to awaken our spirits. Uh, ginger, curry, turmeric, good for new beginnings. - Why don't you go take a walk? - I'd love to. - Yeah. - I'm so excited. - I'll see you in a bit. - Okay. Oh, there's somebody here. Hello. Hi. How are you? Hi... Oh, I'm sorry. Um, habit. I mean with this thing out there I find breaking old habits really, really hard. - You? - Yes. Yes, I... I do. I'm Mary Beth. Such beautiful gardens you have here. Laura, me. Yes. Well, thank you. They aren't my gardens actually. They just they belong to my teacher, Daiku. I just have a room in the big house. I've been here a few months so... You know, I'll introduce you. - He's right over here. - Great! - Yeah, come meet Daiku. - Thanks. Daiku, let me introduce you to Mary Beth. Uh, Mary Beth, um... Higgins. - Hello. - Welcome, and no need to bow. I'm not royalty. What brings you here? Where did you come from? Sort of south west of here, a few hours away. I'm with my friend Wanda, she's back at the RV making soup. It's doubles as a food truck. Her business. Weird, huh? - It's yummy. - Not weird at all. Enjoy our gardens, the beauty and tranquility, the peace. And please, have your friend come join us here. All are welcome. We don't get many visitors here, so it is a treat to have new faces and new conversations. Hey, there you are. - Hi. - Oh, it's just as I remember. Isn't it wonderful? Hi. Hi, uh, I'm Laura and this is Daiku. Oh, hi. Hi, listen, we had rapid tests today and we're negative. How about you guys? Oh, we, we test every day at the retreat, so... Yeah? Should we take off our masks? - Shall we? - Let's keep our distance. - Welcome. - Oh! Thanks. God! So, you've been here before? Yeah, yeah, about five years ago. I didn't stay on the property, but I walked through with a friend and it was so peaceful, this beautiful, calming, place. I just knew why my friend would love it here. She's finding something that's missing, you know, or something lost. I'm looking for, uh... Well, uh... I don't know. Peace, calm, direction, purpose. All can be easily lost, but they're hard to find again. You're seeking. You nailed it. I am seeking. It's how to find it, or, gosh, maybe I never had it. Wow, I'm talking to a complete stranger. Oh, hey, hey, a stranger is just a friend you haven't met yet. Oh, hi! Just the two of you here? Uh, hey, Kris, join us. Oh, thank you, but I need to go back to my cabin. As you can see, there are a few others. There are tent cabins down that hill. I prefer a few people who come truly dedicated to making changes in their lives. Oh, and please enjoy the pool, it's spectacular. Would you guys like to see the house? I have a room there and Daiku lives there too. Please, go enjoy. It's getting late. Nice to meet you, Wanda, Mary Beth. Shall we? This way. This is amazing! Warm and cozy with the art. This is a great house. I mean, I mean great. I know, I love it. How Daiku's decorated it. You know, most come from his travels or gifts from his students. This is beautiful. Does it have a special meaning? Ah. Yeah. She is the green goddess Tara. She symbolizes compassion and liberation. Revered as a woman who brings healing and serenity. Hey, can I use your bathroom? Of course, it's just down there. Well, hey, why don't we provide dinner tonight? I have a big pot of soup I made out in the van. Are you a vegetarian? - Mm-hmm. - Daiku? Yes, but he won't be joining us. He eats alone. His thing. All right, just checking. Wanda's famous butternut squash soup. A little ginger. Oh, it's so good. Caring is sharing as they say or sharing is caring, or I don't know, something like that. Oh, you know, I'm going to go change. Um, have a look around. And I... I like your friend. Just be. Okay, can I get you something to drink? You want, um, orange juice, carrot juice, celery juice? No thanks. A glass of wine? The wine, I'll take. You get wine here? Well... No, we don't get wine here. Our secret. Okay, so... tell me all about Mary Beth Higgins. Who are you? The big question. Just say the first thing that comes to mind. Wash them, squeaky clean. I'll go get the soup. Give me a few. So... When I left the house this morning, I was a mom... a daughter... a wife, though soon to be ex-wife. I meditate too like you, a meditator. That's all. Well, that's actually just a list of titles. Jobs. Seriously, who are you? Or is it too soon to pry? I'm sorry. I just... I'm just always so curious as to why people are seekers. Like, what makes them wake up in the morning and decide to do something, like... Well, like show up here. Be open. Be brave Mary Beth. In a few weeks... my divorce will be final. Twenty years and voila... a marriage over. Hmm, it's tough. Your choice? My choice. And did he find someone else or did you? You know, it's nothing like that. I received a gift from an old friend, a teapot and... and a cup. A memory from a very close relationship 20 years ago. It was a wake-up call. My life has been very predictable, uh, rote, not bad... very lucky in a sense, just... not... Fulfilling? Worth rolling out of bed in the morning. A teapot... and photos of my life before, it all just became... decades of going through the motions. The memories came flooding back. I took a very good look at my marriage. So did Bill. It's over. I'm still processing that. And this memory, was he a lover? She. Yes. Oh, I'm not gay or anything just to be very clear. It was a short thing, a fling. Hmm. Not a fling exactly. I was married very soon after it and it was the right thing to do. - For who? - For me. My parents, society. I can't believe, I'm saying this to a complete stranger, that I slept with a woman. And now that she's going to think that I'm gay or... or that I'm in a relationship with Wanda. Oh, come on, Mary Beth, not everyone is so judgmental. You know, in just a few sentences you told me who you are. A woman. A woman who is changing her life. Being single yet bound to a child. A woman who questions her desires... and for whom. A woman who makes a decision once... and decides to never look back. I'm back. Oh, this pot's hot. I'm just going to go put it down. You know, I flushed most of this down my leg and into my shoe. I got a lot on the driveway too. Whoo, I just wanted to put that down. There's a hose out there. I can go wash it off. Mice or ants or something will come to eat that. No, no, no, stop. Even ants and mice need a gourmet meal. - Really? - Yeah, it smells wonderful. Oh, thank you. Mm-hmm. - You know, my RV doubles as a food truck. - Hmm? Yeah, I just pull into a parking lot somewhere, slap the sign on the side of the van and then I sell soup. One soup, whatever soup I've made that day. Pays for the gas, pays for the food. A true, genuine, free spirit. That's me, me and my sidekick. Oh, well, you certainly don't like energy, do you? Is that a gong? What a great dinner bell. Go for it. Hit it. - Do you feel that? - Yes. Boy, that's addictive. Did it get cold? Are you kidding me? - It's delicious. - You made this today in the van? It's so good! - To girl time. - To girl time! Stop it. Stop it. I'm just going to run this pot out to the van. You know what? I'm actually really tired. I think I'm just going to go to bed. You can come out when you're ready. - I'm ready. - Fine. I'm going to take out the sleeping bag and sleep on the floor. You can take the bed. I just toss and turn when I'm knackered. You know what? Just stay here. I mean, Wanda, you get a good night's sleep in a real bed and Mary Beth just sleep here. Both of you can get a good night's sleep. Oh, um, okay. Well, if you... If you're sure about it. Actually, I think it's a great idea. You've done all the driving and cooking. Get a good sleep. Okay, yeah. You want your bag? I'll sleep in my T-shirt. Right. Okay. Well, I'll see in the morning, out in the gardens. - Sleep well. - I will. Wanda, love the soup. Yes, loved it. Thank you so much. Good night. Knackered, I'm knackered. Let's get some sleep. All right. - Extra pillow? - Thanks. And it's pretty comfy and help yourself to anything. So... - Appreciate it. - Hmm. You know, it's still early. You want to get in the hot tub? I go every night before I go to sleep. No swimsuit. Well, if you're shy just go in your underwear. Personally, nude works for me. Uh... I don't know. Come on, you'll sleep like a baby... and I can go underwear too, you know. Come on. What did I get myself into? Ooh, it's nice. So, I have a question for you. Why did you come here? Well, um... my mom died a couple months ago. Not COVID-19, but... died in a hospital. She went into the hospital and... the last time I was near her was as they lowered her casket into the ground. No people at her funeral. No closure. So... I'm still working through my grief and... being okay with being alone. I'm getting there. I'm getting there. I am and Daiku helps. He helps me cope. Thank you for sharing that. I love the water. It heals me... and when I'm in it, I feel... a peace, cleansing... my heart slows down and... my breathing quiets. Here... give me your hand. Feel. Can I photograph you? Why? I used to be a photographer and... I'd like to enter this contest. Well, actually Wanda would like me to enter this contest and... and I would like for you to be my first subject. Well then, sure. Yeah. Wonderful. Hmm. This was a good idea. Oh, hi ladies. Good morning. Did you have a nice evening? - It was very good. - Yeah. Hey, he's a very cool guy. Just told me to quiet my mind. Please, sit. Oh. Hey, um, you know, I... I've never meditated before, do we say the Om thing and, um, and... And how do we... How do we sit? I think... Is it palms down? No, no, no. Sorry, I saw a photo with palms up, right? Palms up? And... and how do I sit? Is... is it the... the legs are... Is it right over left or is it the left over the right because well, you know, I could do both. Just relax. There are no rigid rules here. In fact, rigid isn't part of this at all. Just try to relax your mind. Relax, okay. Relax my mind. Om. Om. No Om, just quiet. Quiet. I'll give it a whirl. Okay, sorry. My students come here with many questions, but at the core is one basic question. Who am I? Then come the others. Am I truly living my best life? Will I find love and peace? Let go of the phrase I am. I'd love to photograph Laura, she's stunning. My first photo shoot. - Come to this day... - A new beginning. ...that you must define yourselves, but you cannot. You're ever changing... ever floating... ever learning. Just be. Just be. I hope your journey brings you everything you're looking for. This is just the beginning for you, you know. Be open to peace, love now-ness. Love? Not right now. Someday. Love will come. I think it'll be with a... sharing of life kind of person. Not a certain gender or age or expectation. Hmm. Hey, hey. I got your camera. Oh, you got your first photo shoot today, huh? You go, girl. I'll see you guys later. I'm going to go take a walk and got to get some soup on. - Bye. - See you later. Have a good time. Thank you for letting me do this. - Of course. - I'm having a wonderful time. You're so easy to photograph. You're a natural. Gorgeous! I'm just going to make some few adjustments here and then eyes to me. Now I'd love for you to extend your arm, so I can see the length of your body. Yeah, beautiful. Now, if you... if you don't mind I'd like to go over here to the stool, so I can get the sunlight on your face coming in through the windows. - Okay. - Okay. Great! So, follow me. Beautiful! I like that. I love that expression. Yes! That's lovely, Laura. Really nice. Beautiful... Oh! Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I can't find my lucky ladle. I think I probably left it in here somewhere. this drawer. I'm not interrupting, am I? We were just finishing. Oh. You know, I probably already packed it up in the RV and just forgot. You know how that goes. Nice robe. The photos will be gorgeous. I'll send you copies. I'm sorry. Thank you for letting me photograph you. What was that all about? You spying on me? No. No, of course not. I was just curious. I've never seen a fashion shoot before. Oh, this isn't Paris. I was just getting some pics for the photo contest, you convinced me to enter. Oh, yeah. Laura, what a beauty, huh? I bet those shots are damn good. Did you get any of the naked ones? Are you a 12-year-old boy? No, I didn't get any naked pics. Oh, come on, I'm tired. And I'll bet you do snore. Why would you say that? Hi. I, uh... I hope your few days with us opened up your heart and mind to possibilities. Definitely. It definitely did. Yeah. Come back again and stay a while. Oh, hey! Sorry about that whole meditation thing. No Om for me. I'm not making fun of it. I, you know, I just... How do you sit still like that? I like it. It helps me. You helped me, Daiku too. Well... I couldn't. - It should be with you. - Really. Mm-mm. No, it should be with you. Just be. Remember, just... just be. Hey, while you're just being, how about a parting gift? This is Wanda's new famous Clementine spice soup. I know it sounds weird but trust. Wow! Bye. Hey, did you just love it? How about that Laura, huh? Yes, and yes. And how about Daiku? What a cool guy that is, right? He's like the Dalai Lama, but with cooler clothes. Way cool guy. You know what? I didn't mean for any of this to make you sad. Oh! I'm not sad at all, Wanda. For the first time in... a very long time... I feel like me. Not me as someone living in someone else's life. Just me. So sad... ...absolutely not. How about I fix you a cup of tea? I have the water on already. You know, I got your little teapot back here. This is your lucky pot, huh? I mean, who travels with a teapot. It's hot. Yeah, it's a long story. It's a long story but I'll share it with you sometime. Let's just say that the teapot is from one journey and we have started a new one. - Cheers, my friend! - Cheers! To you, to you, Wanda. Thank you. I think we need to go camp. Camp out under the stars, find the quiet. Although, the woods are never really that quiet, - you know, mountain lions and bears and such. - Sleep outside? Yeah, that's the beauty of it. Surrounded by nature. We'll head up north for a few days and sleep in this baby. I got a great camping spot up there. I was thinking maybe we could rent a cabin in the woods with running water and a bathroom, and then sit on the porch, and take in all that nature. Be brave, girl scout. Wanda will protect you from all the scary creatures in the forest. Well, I haven't been camping since I was a kid and I didn't like it. Well, you'll like it now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yes, yes, absolutely. Yes, yes! Whoo. Yes! Wait, did you say mountain lions? I did. I also said bears. Wanda, Wanda, what are you getting... Mountain lions and bears... Oh, yes, I'm on the journey. Finally. Can you hear me? Yes, yes. Mom, you and Kevin hanging in? Where are you? Wanda and I are camping? Wanda does know that roughing it for you is the Holiday Inn, doesn't she? You couldn't even stand summer camp with creepy crawlies and owls in the night. I'm excited about this, mom. Sleeping under the stars, skinny dipping in the lake, telling ghost stories. - Oh, my God! - What, what, what's the matter? You've become 12 again. Is Kevin around? He's in his gym. If you can call tonight he'll be around. Any good news about the virus? It is far from blowing away. You know, people just don't take precautions and all of us suffer. Why on earth you'd want to be out in the world ripe with disease, I'll never know. I'm in the middle of the woods. No one else is around. I'm probably in one of the safest places in America. Hey, mom, I've got to go before Wanda hurts herself putting this tent up. Have fun. Stay safe. Bye. How can I help? Oh! Hey, you can blow this up. Okay, on it. By the way, love this place. I'm okay. You keep outdoing yourself here. I don't feel like I'm making any progress. Want to use this? You have a pump? Yeah, I'm going to die. I'm so dizzy. Here, I'll do it. - Go sit. - All right. Go sit down. I wonder who lives there. That's another little surprise I have for you. Surprise? I'll introduce you once I get all this stuff set up. To whom? You'll see. Oh, you're here. Did you get everything set up? We did. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I brought you my newest creation, Clementine spice soup. Oh... Davina, this is my friend Mary Beth Higgins. - Mary Beth, this is Davina. - I know you. You're Davina Moonbeam. I was at one of your events in San Diego a few years back. Well, I know. I really don't. Everyone expects a psychic to know everything and I don't. Come on in, make yourself to home, we hug here. Oh, so good to meet you. Oh! Oh! - Hi. - This is Karl. Ah, he lives mainly in the trailer, you probably saw when you drove up. He helps me around the ranch. I do. It's a pleasure to meet you ladies. Oh, this is my longtime-friend Wanda and her friend Mary Beth. You, uh... You camping? Oh, yeah. We sure are. Really? Well, I got to go fix some loose boards out on the bridge and feed my horse Blaze, but, uh, if you need anything, you know where to find me. You guys have a good day. Bye, Karl. - Bye. - Toodles. You are something else. Well, homemade apple cider. I don't drink, Alcohol that is. So... Fortune cookies. You will soon be delivered a tall, dark, handsome, charming someone. I think I must have got your cookie. Ooh, let me help you. So, let's use this to officially welcome you... and offer a wish for a successful awakening on this part of your journey. Wanda filled me in a bit. I can't believe you already know who Davina is, and here I was thinking I had this great surprise for you. It's a surprise all right. Are you retired? From events, yes. Well, the mind never sleeps, but until I die. - Oh. - Hmm. Who knows? Maybe even beyond. I'll still see things, know things. It's the gift that keeps on giving. And it's the gift that I want to give to you. What? I came here purposely because I know that Davina can help you figure out where you're going, you know, what's next. Oh, I... I don't know. Who really wants to know the future? Everyone! So, come on, Mary Beth. You've got nothing to lose. Just be open. I'm going to wait outside. Leave you two alone. You are at the crossroads in your life, more like a big X. So many choices. Which... path to take is constantly on your mind. Something happened to awaken your desire to figure out your life. No kidding. Plus, I'm sure Wanda told you all about our journey. I was told nothing personal about you. Everything I see or hear is new to me. Your son... You have a son. Oh, young, smart... he will keep well. You worry about him now more than ever. I... I see him leaving with... a relative to go stay with them while you're on your quest. A quest! Yes. That's what this is... but you don't know what you want yet. Oh. I see a... a separation. Oh, a permanent separation. It will be... it will be easier for both you and your partner... No... your husband. He wants this as well. I... I see a book. A book on a table. Inside are your words and your photos from this time in your life. Oh, you have much talent, creative talent. Your time to show the world has arrived. A book? My photos? Oh! I see a new love in your life. Someone you know or have known a long time. You will know who... when you are ready to let this someone... in. She does know I'm still married... at least another week or two. I can't imagine having someone new in my life right now. I see no. Time is... something made up by man. It's... My minutes could be your hours, my days your months. I am here in the now as you are. You need to open up. Take risks. When you open up... people, possibilities, changes, they all come. Watch for the signs. They are all around. Just know this. What I see in your future is not easy. Leaving one life to start another, but in the end you will find you. Right now, just be in it. Present. Daiku said to just be. Laura said I'd find me. Davina, Wanda... Be honest with people. Don't hold back... and those that love you will still be there. And those that walk away... you don't need. Hey, I just came to walk you back to the tent. Thank you, Davina. You're welcome, honey. Good to meet you. I love you. Well? I mean, was she amazing or... Ever question who you are? Yeah, sure, like daily. That's an elusive answer. Can I just have a few minutes? Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure. Of course. Hey, how about hot dogs for dinner? Wanda? Was Davina's reading upsetting? I know that things in my life are coming to an end... and... she said new things are coming. How she knew about Bill and Kevin, I have... I can't figure it out. - Did you... - Tell? No. No. Not at all, Zero. I swear. What'd she say? It wasn't what Davina said, it's... She made me realize that change is coming. It's going to be hard... but eventually it'll be good, in the end. Well, that's good, right? That's the right attitude. Just once... just once. This is all I ask the universe. Just once, I'd like to feel like... like I'm first or equal. I want to feel that passion they talk about. Passion for career... passion for another person. You know, I... I don't know what to say about all that. I do know that Davina knows her stuff. And, you know, I'm here for you. I'm always here for you to... to talk or whatever. Did you want to go home? Absolutely not. I need this time with you. I have a lot to think about. Are you hungry? We got to eat. Why don't I get you a glass of wine? Wine. I'll take the wine. I thought you might. Shit! Ah, fuck! Ah! Oh! Here's some of your favorite. Oh! Oh my! Oh! Oh, that's cold. Okay, let me help you. I got... I got it. No, okay. Now don't look, don't look. - Oh... - Come here. Come here. Oh, it's so cold. Thank you. I love you. I know. Hey, good morning. Yes, it is. You want some coffee? Cream or sugar? Oh, relax, black is fine. This looks wonderful. I'm starving. Me too. After wrestling with that tent and blowing up the air mattress, burned a lot of calories. I was up really early this morning... and I went, um, scouting out the place. Some really, really beautiful things to see. You want to go exploring today? - Do you... do you hike? - I do. You're a really good snuggler. I was, uh... protecting you from the mountain lions. That's all. Yeah. Well, I can report that I was not attacked. So, good job. So a hike would be great and a shower afterwards, I guess? Is there a shower? No. I usually just take a couple of buckets of water and pour it over myself. It works. I'll get my shoes... and about the shower, might have to help me with that. So pretty. Okay. - You draw? - Yeah. I've been sketching a little bit since I was a teenager. Like an escape, you know. You're full of surprises. - Morning. - Hi. He's beautiful. Is he gentle? What, Blaze? He's an overgrown puppy. What, do you want to hop on him? I'd love to. I haven't ridden in years. Get in here. - Just bare back, huh? - Why not? Okay. - You're going to give me a push? - Yeah. There you go! You're a natural. - Natural. - Yeah. Oh. Hold on. If you're going to be around a while, I could saddle him up, take him for a ride. I don't know how long we'll be here. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Thanks, Blaze. - Thank you. - Have a good day! You too. - Was that fun or what? - Oh. Oh, I haven't been on a horse in years. That makes me feel so alive. Just doing these things that haven't done in so long. I'm starting to feel the joy, I haven't felt in a very long time now. Thank you. I've been with a woman. Just one, long time ago. I've been with a few women. I'm not a womanizing type of person or anything like that. I don't even go to bars. I'm not a cheater, never cheated. I'm not either. I was faithful to Bill from the day we were married. Now, our only connection is Kevin, of course. Free to choose whatever and whoever I want... and I'm scared of both. Make sense? So tell me about this one and only woman experience that you had. Was it one of those college things? Right after. I was... It my first professional photoshoot. What a coup! I was all of 20 or so and... and I got to go to London, and shoot this beautiful model in London. Had tea on the River Thames, very romantic, hence, the teapot. Oh, see, I knew there had to be some special meaning there. I mean who brings a ceramic teapot on a road trip? We met on that photoshoot, the model. The model? - I fell in love. - Hmm. That lose your breath kind of love. Oh. She was beautiful... sexy, funny. I was absolutely lost in her... for a month. Just a month? Then? Bill... my parents... my fears. I've felt that way... in a small way. But, you know, like you, I wanted more. Having my life be my life for the first time in forever... feels good. You okay hanging out with me? I love hanging out with you. You're... You're funny and curious and a little crazy. We're good. We're very good. You've never had s'mores? I'm sheltered. Okay. So - it's time for you to have your first s'more. - Ooh. Now, I'll build a fire and we're going to get everything all hot and gooey, but first I want to introduce you to the ingredients. You got your trio of ingredients here. You've got your chocolate. Then you got your graham crackers and then marshmallows. I usually have cookies on a skewer and get them really burnt, and gooey, but the... That's my favorite ingredient. Whoa! - Was that a good sign or what? - Incredible! You know, I ordered that up just for you. Knowing you, I believe it. Ah, that was amazing! Here, can I have some of that? I'll trade you... - Yeah, give me that. - ...the chocolate - for the marshmallow. - You know what? You know what? I don't even need to melt it anymore. You're good. Good subject. Shit! I... I shouldn't have done that. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I should not have done that. What's that? My God! That sounds really big. It sounds like something's coming. Oh, my God, Davina! You're gonna kill me. I thought you might like to come up to the house for some homemade apple pie and a cup of cocoa before you... Oh, were you sleeping? Did I wake you up? I'm sorry. No, no. We're just relaxing, listening to wild animal sounds. - What time is it? - Nine o'clock. I would love apple pie and hot cocoa. - We'll be there. - Let's go. Oh, good! You got here before Gus got you. - Gus? - The mountain lion. Oh, my God! You named him. Cougar, whatever you want to call him. He's been here for years. I don't bother him, he doesn't bother me. Oh, you girls remembered to zip up your tent and lock up your food, right? Thanks for the heads up, Davina. Not exactly. Oops! Sorry, ladies. It's my mom. I have to take it. Oh, please. Is everything okay? Did something happen? No, no, nothing happened. I just wanted to let you know I'm going to head home tomorrow. Kevin's going to come with me. He can do his remote school stuff from my house and I get to go home. Well, I'll be home in a week. Are you sure? I need my own space. I can get my pooch out of the kennel. I hope she talks to me again and Kevin could use a vacation after all these months. I have a pool. Okay, I understand. Just make sure you lock up the house before you leave. I thought I'd leave the front door wide open and put up a welcome thief sign. Mom. Anyway, thanks for taking care of my boy. I'll come pick him up as soon as I get home. I'm actually loving having him to myself, you know, I get lonely too. As a matter of fact, one of the things that I'm learning from all this is that we need to be around the people we love so much more. Let's make you and us a priority from now on. Sounds like this trip and your friend have been good for you. Yes, both. Well, you two have fun and, uh, I'll call you soon. And... Hey, ma, if I haven't told you lately that I love you, uh... I do. Everything okay? Oh, yeah, mom and Kevin are heading to her house. She's anxious to get back and it's fine. Really, it's... it's okay. Oh, well, how about a warm up, huh? Oh, no. No, thank you. Oh, boy! This doesn't happen to me very often. What? What is it? Well, I'm having a déjà vu again. I'll share it with you if you want to hear it. Yes. I had a dream last night... and Mary Beth you were in it. Really? Yeah, it wasn't anything terrible, but it came with a word of caution and I wanted to share it with you, but I feel like, I might be jumping into something that I shouldn't. But you know what? I'm going to do it anyway. Now you got me really curious. I know that you two have gotten... close. I knew something was coming... but now I see something else coming. What? History. I don't understand. I saw you running away, Mary Beth. You've done that before. The time to stop... running away... is now. Now is the time to run to people, places, things with your eyes open... and your heart open. What... I have... I have to go back to the tent now. I better go. Hey, hey. Love is there. Love is there. What happened? She knows. She knows that I... I ran away from Barbara. That's what I do when I'm scared. I run. I don't want to. I don't plan to. I don't want to hurt anyone. Deep thoughts? Hey, it's Wanda. - How deep can they be? - Don't, don't, don't. Remember, it's me. Yeah. It's just that I have been thinking. You know, thinking a lot. Maybe too much... about her. About... - Her... - Her. Oh... You went on this trip, this journey, to open up her world. My dear friend... she has opened yours. When we were in the meditation gardens... I just saw this light come over her. There's this woman there, Laura who gave her a statue of the green Tara, do you know it? Oh, I do. A powerful force. The Great Protectress, compassionate force, who fuels all life, addresses all your fears. I'm afraid, Davina. I'm afraid. I am afraid. I've already let her in. And then we'll go home and this trip will end, and I'll just... Oh, I've misread all the queues and I'll just be alone again. You've only known her a few months and how long have you been on this trip? What? A week? I'm not putting my psychic hat on. I'm putting my friend hat on. Just be. Just sit in the now-ness. Oh... You're ready to let someone into your life, fully. - It scares you. - Oh, it does. She is on the cusp. She is still getting used to her own aloneness, her own fears. She runs deeper. Let it unfold. Just let it unfold. You should have waited so I could help you. Oh, it's no problem. Did you have a nice walk? Wanda, I have to say something and I... I need you to listen to understand. Oh. Okay. When Barbara sent me that teapot, it was like... someone turned the lights on. It was a much needed light in the middle of everyone having to stay in their homes and Bill and I splitting up, time to think. Way, way, too much time to think. I think I know what you're trying to say. You need to get home now. You need a little space from me. - You need time for yourself. - Listen, stop. I'm saying that this quest with you has been like, the door slowly opening up to reveal the light again. There's just a lot of pieces in the air and... I need to see how those pieces land. It takes time. You know, one of the only things I have is time. If you're in my life and you're here to stay now that's all that matters. We are friends. It's not going to change. Let's go home. Heading home has a nice ring to it. Hey, you know, you didn't say a word all the way home. Thinking. Listen, I'm going to take my bags in the bedroom. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you need to be home now. See your kid. Sleep in your own bed. Sing real loud in the shower. I've, uh, never been inside your house before. It's warm. Spotless. That's a relief. You know what? I'll go get the surplus of toilet paper you left in my van. Oh, Wanda, you don't need to do that. No, I'm going to go get it because if I don't, you'll just order more online, and I'll have to deliver it later anyway. - Fair enough. - Get settled. Settled. Will I ever be settled again? Actually, I hope I never settle again for anything? The only thing I want to go back to is Kevin and now... I'm back with your TP. I will trade you this TP for a glass of wine. Oh! I'll take that trade. Your house is really great. - A musician too? - Oh, like, no. Thank you. To the journey. Yeah. Thanks. You know, you just drove eight hours. I'm tired. You have to be exhausted. Why don't you stay? Stay here? Yeah, get some sleep. Like a capping it off with a slumber party? Okay. Yes. You know, if someone would have told me a month ago that we were going to go on this grand adventure and... and I was going to experience that gorgeous meditation center and camp with mountain lions, and have a psychic reading, and watch a shooting star, I would have thought it was the makings of a... an epic novel. But, Mary Beth, you are back home again, and, uh... I need to talk to Kevin, assure him that he'll be okay and... and I'll be okay. Why me? What do you mean? Well, you thought about me and... planned this this journey, and cared for me. Why? Hmm. I know what it's like to feel lost. You know, years ago... I met someone who taught me that life... is actually pretty simple. It can be quite joyous if we just let joy be. She taught me to stay present, be kind, do no harm... and to never look back. Above all... not to look back. Plus, I just love being with you. I love being with you too. And on that note, I am going to top us off with some wine. It was Davina, wasn't it? It was. Were you lovers? No, she took me in when I needed taking in. Hey, why don't we get into our jammies and get the slumber party started? Oh, Wanda, only you. - Jammies? - Yeah. Okay. I'm going to get mine from the RV. And I'm going to get my jammies on. - Get your jammies on. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Bend your knees. - What? - Just... Yeah.
