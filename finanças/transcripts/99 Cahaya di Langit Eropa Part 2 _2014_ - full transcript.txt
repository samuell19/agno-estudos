200 years after Prophet Muhammad PBUH passed away, the spread of Islam has reached Europe. Cordoba, a Muslim civilization city in Europe. Where sermons could unite with technology and harmony between religious communities. But everything ended when greed in the name of belief, suspicion, and betrayal between mankind was started. God is great. Khan! Where are you going? You haven't finished studying. I want to play with my friends. I know what they play out there. Don't lie, Khan. Jihad is not stupid thing, Dad. Jihad is noble act. Right, but not with what they play. You're different from them. Why do I have to be different? Don't you want to take a revenge to those who harmed our family? An eye for an eye. - Rajesh has... - Khan! What they did will not solve this country's problems. I don't want to be a coward. Jihad to God is not with swords, but with your minds. With this. This thing. Jihad is with pen and knowledge, not with cowardly acts. You're my only hope. You will shine for your family. Khan, Khan, Khan! - No, Dad. - Khan! Khan! I sent them away, Dad. I promise to do jihad with this. Why do they have to force their will to pray there? You have to know the history of the building first, Stephan. This used to be a mosque. That's why... That's why Stephan, you have to know the building's functions in the past. This was called Mezquita, where Islam developed in Europe. - Yeah, in the past. - Yes. Before Spain took over the building. The point is this, you pray to God. You use religion as a guide in life to be a better human being. Why does it have to be this kind of violence? All three of them came here to pray, correct? - Correct. - And they were stopped with violence. Violence is stupidity. 99 LIGHTS IN THE SKY OF EUROPE Today is almost two years that I've been in Vienna, Fatma. Alex, my neighbor who used to hate me, has changed and became my friend. He's very interested in my travel pictures. I continued your friendship with Lative and Ezra. They're very good in English now. We are passionate to do the gift of sharing by teaching English to kids in Vienna's mosque. The job vacancy to be a reporter that you gave to me meant so much. I'm so happy to get to know the Muslims here. They are so amazing. How is Ayse doing? You haven't replied to any of my emails, Fatma. Is Ayse getting better? Fatma, I just wanted to say thank you for all of the things that you have done for me. - She hasn't replied? - Not yet. Rangga! I've been looking for you everywhere, here you are. I need your help, Rangga. - Let me pray, first. - Just one minute. Because Professor Reinhardt has given me a deadline to submit the proposal of my thesis. - But now... - Let Rangga pray as a Muslim first. - Hold on. - Okay. Let's go. - Ablution, sorry. - Yes. I thought he's going to pray, why go back? He needs to clean before facing God. Okay. Oh, Rangga, before I forgot. Professor Reinhardt invited both of us to the annual gala dinner. So could you accompany me there? Let's talk about it after I pray. Okay. - Okay. - Sorry, hold on. Okay. Let's go. I have never done this much ablution because of one woman. How could a simple touch be such an issue? - You don't understand. - No. I don't understand this either. It doesn't square with my logic. That makes no sense at all. It makes no sense at all. Right. Are my hands filthy or what's this about? Maybe you are just a filthy girl. Wait. Where are you going? You haven't paid. Oh, no, not again. Did I bring money? - Cheers. - Cheers. - Last week, it was toing and froing. - Yes. - Yes. - You can't know that. Cheers. - How are you? What are you up to? - Can I have your number? Wait. Hello! - Walking away already? - I am Michael. - You have to be careful. - What do you mean? You're not serious about going to the ballroom party with Maarja? - I can't dance. - That's not what I mean. - So what do you mean? - She's not your muhrim. I know she's not my muhrim, but I don't get this conversation. Yeah, well, here's the thing, Maarja is beautiful, - she's smart. - Yes. She has a broad knowledge. A man with a weak faith will be tempted. - So you mean my faith is weak? - No. I'm just trying to remind you as a friend. - Thank you for reminding me. - Sure. - Are we still going to my apartment? - Yes. - Because we have to practice dancing... - Oh yeah, right. for that Waltz party, Rangga. It's unfortunate that my wife is in Pakistan. If she's here, she would cook for you. - Try it. - What's this? Specialty tea from Pakistan. This tea has a little bit of cinnamon, pistachio, a little bit of almond, nuts and some baking soda. There's a lot of "a little bit". Is this your father? Yes. He's a teacher in Pakistan. Remember my missing pen? He gave me the pen. This must be you and your brother when you were little. Yes, that's Rajesh. He died in a bombing. Innalillahi... Okay, Rangga, these were the video recordings we made during college. Which video are you looking for? I'm looking for the video when I was sick, you recorded me. - Do you still have it? - When you were sick? Oh, you weren't sick then. You were homesick and missed your wife. Yes, I missed her, not really sick. Sick was just an excuse. Which one was that? What's this for anyway? - Oh, here. - To strengthen my faith. We really have to find the right one. Don't get the wrong one, very dangerous. - I know. You probably put it here. - I think it's that one. Khan! Yes, Maarja? Did you not deliver my message to Rangga on purpose? I waited for an hour. - That's for your own good, Maarja. - What do you mean? I know how you feel about Rangga. - But that's none of your business. - Yes, it's none of my business. But the problem here is, do you want to be the second woman? I think, Rangga, your religion is not fair - especially towards women. - I bet this is about Maarja? That's not my religion, that's me personally who's uptight about touching manner. It's not just about that. Why are every women from your religion are told to cover themselves? Veil, the purpose is to protect them. From what? People aren't going to judge their appearance. More about their mindset and personality. Why do men from your religion are allowed to do polygamy? To my knowledge, polygamy is allowed. If the person is able. I'm not. Because not every man can do polygamy. Don't tell me because of love. Because I'm sure every man who has a lot of wives can love all of his wives. No, that's not true. That's different. Love is a responsibility. It's like you're going to two colleges. You have to finish both studies. Just one gives me a headache. Just one gives you a headache. That's a different case. Because you don't want to be responsible. Hey! Leon? Ayse, you're going to fall. Watch it, Ayse! Hey, Leon? Leon? Hey, Leon? - Rangga? - Yes? Rangga, come here. Yeah. What is it? - Do you want to travel again? - Where to? - Paris? - No. There's a cheap ticket, promotion to Cordoba. Do you want to go? Let's talk about it tomorrow, I need to work on my paper. - Alright, just forget about it. - Are you angry? I'm thirsty. What is this? My dissertation proposal that I'm submitting to Professor Reinhardt. It's good. Some of it were based on your suggestion. Hey, Rangga. Don't eat it yet, Rangga. Here, written in the love book. If a woman gives an apple to a man, that could be a sign that she's giving her heart to you. Or giving temptation just like Eve to Adam. As if you believe in the love manual book. Here, look. Rangga. Yeah. Leon? Hi. What are you doing? Hi, aunt. I'm waiting for my Mum. Aunt, which school does Ayse now go to? - Ayse? - You still meet with her, don't you? Not anymore, Leon. Was she still angry with me? No, Leon. Why did you think so? My teacher said that Ayse was ill. Is that true? It's because of me, isn't it? Leon! Ayse is ill. But she... - Here let me put it on for you. - Is this from Fatma? - Yes. - Thank you, Fatma. But why isn't Aunty Hanum wearing a veil like me and you, Mom? I still have a headache, if I don't have a headache anymore, I will wear a veil just like you and your mother. - Do you promise? - I promise. - Come on. - What are you doing? Practice dancing for the ball dance specially for overseas students. I can't do it. I can't do it. Professor Reinhardt has invited us to represent this faculty. - Come on. - I said I can't. - I bet you can do it, it's easy. - Just practice. So you don't embarrass our faculty at the ball later. See? Listen. So go back, to the right and to the front. - It's easy, right? - Yeah. Hey, Khan! Hey, Curry Man. It's time for Ashar, right? Oh, I have to pray Ashar first. - Let's go. - Let's go. God is great. God is great. Honey, in Vienna every year there is 450 dance ball party. - The answer is no. - Why not? Just no, I can't do it. I'm embarrassed. Please accompany me. No, not me. Then who am I supposed to go with? - With whom? That Maarja girl? - Of course not. Am I allowed? - Don't you dare. - I won't. It's nice, right? Halum, have you got a present from your husband yet? What is that? No. He hasn't even wished me a happy birthday. Well... Maybe he forgot. He is a man, after all. Normally, - all he thinks about is his work. - Right. Let's go for a walk. Come on, let's practice again. I can't. But Professor Reinhardt has said that we all have to come. I already have plans with my wife. Just find another partner. Hey, Curry Man! Don't ever put your curry in this microwave ever again. - Why? - It stinks! And one more thing, every time you put in your curry in this microwave, you have to clean it! - You have never done that. - Done what? You warm up your pork meat here, right? Have you ever cleaned it? Never! If my curry stinks, your food is even more annoying. It's even haram for me. This is about cleanliness. - Ethics has nothing to do with religion. - Of course it has! You can't respect other people's belief. You're too radical with your religion's teachings. Rangga can be more tolerant. Why can't you? - You threw away my food! - So what? - That's radical! - What are you going to do? - Hey. - Hi. Hi, where is Rangga? - He went to the library. - Do you need anything? Today is my birthday. - Your birthday? Happy birthday! - Thank you. - Happy birthday. - Yes. Thank you. Okay, I'm going to head to the library. Yes, okay. Don't ever put your curry in the microwave again. What? Let me see how far you've reached. I just came back from Professor Reinhardt's office. And we talked about... - If it's the dance, I can't. - No, it's not about the dance. - My proposal has been accepted. - That's good. That's really good. Thank goodness. I'm sorry. Hanum. Sexy... You can use the "sexy" for the woman earlier. Must be nice to be kissed by a white woman, and she's pretty. I know you went to campus, let me explain. Explain what? There's no need. I just didn't expect that during my birthday I'll get such a bitter present. - Let me explain to you. - What do you need to explain? - You want to deny it? - I'm not. - Maarja is always... - Oh, so she's always like that? - She always kiss your cheek? - It's her culture. With Professor Reinhardt, Stephan, maybe even the security. It's not funny. I'm not being funny. I know when a woman likes a man. Even the way she stares into your eyes is different. She likes you, why can't you realize that? - You don't even try to reject her. - I did. Do you even remember my birthday? I'm asking you, do you remember? Did you say happy birthday? Not even a present. I didn't ask anything from you. You don't have time for me, it's fine. Even if you're busy, it's fine. But just that one thing, please respect my feeling. - Don't mess around. - I never did with her. How would I know that? - Let me talk. - You might just came back and you're with her. - Let me talk. - Talk about what? - It is too much. - What else do you want to say? I don't want to deal with you anymore. Okay. If I knew it would be like this, I would've returned to Indonesia. I've never forgotten your birthday. Hi, Honey, praise to God, three years have passed and this is our last year in Europe. Did you know this whole year I have prepared a special birthday surprise for you. I had to do it in between doing my dissertation. This video recorded our journey. And our meeting with unforgettable people such as our friends, Ayse and Fatma. For me, the days before you came to Vienna were the hardest. Hey, what are you doing? Let me see it. This is my wife. - Yes. - You have to show it. - Did you see it? Enough? Satisfied? - Is this Hanum? - Yes, are you satisfied? - Yes, very much. - I'm proud of my wife, she's beautiful. - Yes, very much. - No, not this one. - Why not? It's a letter for my wife, don't. - It's for my wife, don't. - Is that so? - You sure this is for your wife? - Yes. Really? If it's for her, then let me hear it. We have to hear it. - After I read it, stop it, okay? - Okay, sure. - Done after I read it. - Yes, done. Okay, I'll read it now. Honey, how are you in Indonesia? Please be patient, Honey. After I saved up enough money, we can spend time together, I miss you very much. Please forgive me, Honey. Only this special little love video that I can give to you. I hope you still remember our wedding vows. That we will go through the bitter and sweet, the happiness and sorrow of life together. How did you know I was here? A good place to eat, cheap and still open, where else could it be? It's already closed. Do you want to look for another place? I don't want to, if you're still upset. I have a stomachache. Please forgive me. I already saw the present. - Do you like it? - I like it. I won't ever forget your birthday. I love you. You don't have to cry. Let's find something to eat. Let's find something to eat, let's go. Why are you making it as a joke? - What is it? - Your face whenever I'm angry. You can only stay quiet and stare. - I'm sorry. - Yes. - I didn't mean it to be that way. - Yes. - I didn't mean to be jealous. - Then what was that? Of course I was a little jealous. But I saw Khan and Stephan arguing in campus. What now? - Do they often argue? - Everyday. - Don't you try to stop them? - I did. Almost everyday. Is that so? I'll try to talk to them again. Give this to Ayse. Khan. Hey, Rangga. - Stephan, what's the problem now? - It's not a problem. You have to stop your little quarrel. No use, if you want to talk about this, talk to him. - He's our friend. - He has a grudge towards me. - It's no use. - What do you mean a grudge? Do you know how he sees me? He sees me as a terrorist who brings a bomb everywhere to threaten his life. You have to be more wise towards Stephan. Do you know what country I come from? I'm from Pakistan, a country filled with land mines that it's "land of the mines". Land mines can blow up anywhere, anytime, - and the victim can be anyone. - Yes. - Do you know that? - I get that. You do understand, but does Stephan? No! I went to college here so that I could study and return to my country so that I could change my country to be safe like this country. Like Stephan's country! Rangga, I appreciate you because you're not judgmental. You don't look down on me even if I don't have a religion. But Khan, the Curry Man, I'm like the most sinful person to him. What you both need to do is get to know one another. Try it. The whole campus call me Curry Man, Papa Curry... And maybe you don't know this yet. That's the only thing that I can buy in this country that's cheap and halal. Aside from pork. Same thing with salted fish. - Assalamualaikum. - Waalaikumsalam. No wonder Professor Reinhardt wanted his best student to come to the Waltz dance. Because that party is the pride of Vienna. - I'm not going. - Why not? I already said I want to go with you. - It would be weird if I went with... - Maarja? - Yes. - You still think I'm jealous? Does my face still show that I'm mad? I already prepared your tuxedo, and shined your shoes so it sparkles. - Are you sure you won't be angry? - I'll be mad if you don't go. Why? I don't mind. - I'll go. - That's it. Thank you. My pleasure, Honey. Don't hold it like this, you might ruin the suit. Go and change your clothes. Hey, hold on. - There's one condition. - What is it? Absolutely. Are we going? Why did you suddenly came? Didn't you say yesterday... I respect Professor Reinhardt's invitation. I've been looking for you everywhere and here you are. I need fresh air. - Want to go back inside? - No need. Why not? The event hasn't finished. But you're not here. What do you mean that I'm not here? Your heart and your mind is not present. Good evening, Miss. Good evening, Sir. - Is the party over? - It's over. Why are you by yourself? You didn't bring your partner? I don't need to. I'm trying to meet my real partner, Hanum Salsabila. Rangga Almahendra. You are a very faithful man. - Ready? - Do I go first or you do? - I move back and you move forward. - Okay. You do need to know, Mr. Rangga, that I don't have a formal education in dance. I'm also not a professional, Miss. But just trust me. Okay. I'm moving forward, now go to the right. Okay. Where are you going? I thought you said a professional dancer. You only eat salted fish and shrimp paste chili, don't ask too much. You're the one who eats it. I only cook it. Are you happy? - There's one more thing. - What? I know this. - Since it's on discount. - Cordoba! Finally we've arrived. - Cordoba. - Mezquita. Mezquita, Cordoba, Rangga. The Grand Mosque of Cordoba. Glory be to Allah. This mosque is so beautiful. Islam's very amazing civilization. Why does history have to end this way? Disappear without a trace. Why couldn't we pray there? I was just being grateful. The rule is clear. Yes, but it's a mosque, it should be alright. It's not a mosque anymore. There's no need to talk about it now. - The food is not here yet. - Honey... We have to appreciate history. - Thank you. - Enjoy your meal. Honey... do you want to be a good Muslim agent? I understand. Could I get the bill? It was already paid by the couple who sat by the photo. - Thank you very much. - No problem. Hey! Thank you. - Is this Averroes? - Yes. The philosopher who introduced Plato, Socrates, Pythagoras to Europe. The true Father Renaissance of Europe. Yes and Cordoba... This symbolizes religious harmony. Sorry I forgot to book a hotel. It's alright. I didn't expect that at this hour the city would still be alive. It's a pity to sleep through the real city of light. There's still a lot of lights that we need to enjoy. Fatma, I don't know how many times I've sent you an email to tell you about our postponed journey. Fatma, I just want to tell Ayse. That she should be proud to be a Muslim. Cordoba is the proof. There's not one thing that can make her embarrassed to be a Muslim. - Rangga! - Yes? - It's so cold. You left this. - Thank you. Hold on. Now I'm warm. - I don't drink alcohol. - Why? Is it a sin? Here's the thing, Rangga. In many big cities of Europe, - water is more expensive than beer! - Yes. So all the cold homeless people, they buy beer so that they don't get frozen to death. That's a matter of choice. Instead of dying, it's better to commit a sin, here. Instead of dying while committing many sins, I'd rather not drink. So everyone who drinks alcohol, would go to hell? That's not for me to decide. The devil entered hell because he had a problem with God? - Yes. - The devil was made from fire, right? - Yes. - Hell is also fire? Yes. So that means the devil enters hell that is full of fire, he must be happy dancing while drinking wine, right? - Can I borrow your hand? - Sure. Does it hurt? - Ouch! - Sorry. - Does it hurt? - Rangga! - Why? - This is skin and this is too. - It hurts, right? - But it hurts. Yes, it's just a simple analogy. Oh okay, now I get it. So I bet the devil in hell would really suffer then. Yeah, maybe you can wait in hell and ask the devil yourself. I'm going home first, see you tomorrow. Hey, Rangga! See you tomorrow. Thank you, Stephan! So cold, man. Ami, assalamualaikum. - Rangga. - Yes? After everything is finished, I will come back. - I believe you. - Your solidarity is too much. Rangga, has he intimidated you? How could he go first? Hey, your dissertation is about haram and halal in the success of business in Europe, that's not going to work. You don't have to say that. Do you want to go first? Do you want to go first? Stephan, do you want to go first? You can replace me, but he still goes first. What poison has he put in you? Definitely not the pig poison that you eat everyday. Hey! Some problem you don't know. The problem here is your religion is so annoying. Don't try to talk about us when you don't know anything. There's no need for violence, let him go, stop it. - You see that? - Give him time. Okay. I don't know what else I can do to make them at peace. Let them be. They are adults. Yes, Khan? What is it? So what happened to his father? I don't know, it's not clear. Stephan? - Rangga? - Praise to God, you're awake. - Hanum? - Yes. - Would you like to drink? Hold on. - Just rest. Don't get up, it's broken. Don't get up. - What do we do? - Let me do it. It's okay. Don't force yourself to get up. - You were unconscious for three days. - This is all Khan's fault. You should be thankful to him. He took you to the hospital. - I tried to avoid him. - What for? - He saw what happened. - Khan? He brought you to the hospital. He kept coming for a few days to take care of you. Ami, assalamualaikum. Assalamualaikum, Khan. - Waalaikumsalam, Ami? - Yesterday, your father, Khan. Yesterday your father got hit by a bomb. There was a bomb in Karachi, Khan's father became a victim. He has to go home unsure when he'll be back. Oh my goodness. Mom, when did this happen? Is dad okay? You have to come back, Khan. You have to come back. No. - Khan. - Dad, how are you? Listen to me, Khan. Don't worry about me. - I'll be there as soon as possible. - No! Don't forget your promise to your dad. Don't come here before you finish your studies. - Dad, no. - Listen to me, son. Go back to Pakistan with your college degree. And use that degree for the betterment of Pakistan. Promise me, Khan. Promise me. - Dad... - Promise me. Promise me, Khan! I promise you, Dad. There is no God but Allah. Dad? This is so hard, Dad. I can't understand English. I get it. It's not easy, but I know you can. It's determination in your heart that counts. Determination helps you mastering it. But, Dad... English is your way to see a much bigger world. Reach for knowledge you can use for this nation. Understand? Come on, I support you. Come on. That's why he has to present his dissertation first. - Hello. - Hello. - Assalamualaikum. - Waalaikumsalam. It's broken here. It's broken there. Fracture and internal bleeding. Only those? How about your brain? Is it still normal? I can already smell your curry since you came in this hospital. Do you think I'm still normal or not? Normal, I guess. I can help you. You took it from me the other day, right? Admit it. Then we're even now. I don't have to pay you for hospital fees. Here, just take it. It's for you. You have to return my money. Your father is a great man. Because just with this pen, he could raise an amazing son. Rangga told me everything. My condolences. Yeah, maybe that's the best for him. Rangga and I have gone through so many incidents. Incidents that made our hearts more confident to continue being a good Muslim agent. Today Rangga will graduate. This mark the end of our time in Europe. It feels like it was just yesterday that Rangga started his studies here. And I met you. Three years in Europe. Just like you once said, diversity is a blessing. And you taught us that. Praise to God. Thank you Rangga for your help. I've learned a lot from your dissertation. Hopefully next year you can also graduate. I hope so. Thank you. Thank you. Rangga! Praise to God. I'll pursue all of the tests that were left because of Friday prayers. I'm sure you can do it. I'm sure you can. - Hey, Curry Man. - Yes, Piggy Man? - You have to stay longer here. - Why? You can't leave. You're the only friend I have left here. If I go back to Pakistan, and you know what? - He wants to come along. - That's good. We don't want to disturb your time together. No. Our time together? You guys are trying to start over. Can't believe we're leaving Europe. - Will you miss Europe? - Very much. I've already told you. The purpose to go to Europe is to return to build our own nation. Am I handsome? Of course you're handsome, I'm proud of you. When did you quit your job? Yesterday, I took care of it. We've never said thank you to the person who gave you a job. What's wrong? You got an email? What's wrong? No need, just do that. It should be around here. Should I just call? - Assalamualaikum. - Waalaikumsalam. Waalaikumsalam, Fatma? Are you well? - I'm well, praise to God. - Praise to God. Praise to God. - Hanum. - Yes? Be careful, there's Ayse's sibling in here. Are you? Are you pregnant? Praise to God. No wonder you got prettier. A lot of things that I haven't heard from you. I bought three tickets for us to go to Hagia Sophia. - Let's go. - Let's go. Hagia Sophia was built around eight centuries ago as a cathedral. But when Sultan Ahmed II reign power in Turkey, Hagia Sophia became a mosque. By building minaret towers that soars high towards the sky. Now Hagia Sophia has been turned into a museum by the Turkish government. A very special museum. Because it's the only museum in the world that became a witness that different religious symbols could coexists harmoniously in a place of worship. I'm trying to imagine in the past when Hagia Sophia was taken over to be a mosque like this. The Ottoman commander must've asked all Catholic symbols to be taken down. But apparently they didn't. See? Those are still around. The Sultan must've been a wise man, that's why it was allowed. It was meant for us to learn. That Islam also teaches love, compassion and knowledge. Yes, this is the opposite of Mezquita. So before it was a cathedral, mosque and now it's a museum. I always tell Ayse. That our Turkish ancestors were great people. They could coexist love and compassion without hurting anyone. This is the proof. This is our mosque of pride. This is called the Blue Mosque because the design inside is dominated by blue ceramics. In the past, the mosque was not only used for worship. But also for school and care for those in need. Where is Ayse? I miss her so much. I have a lot of things for her. I bought refrigerator magnets from Cordoba especially for her because she collects them. And Marion wants me to give this for Ayse. Leon also sends his regards for her. How's Ayse's condition, Doctor? Medical science has its limits to heal her. Only God has the knowledge and power without limits. We can only pray and be patient until she is well. Mom... Mom... If Ayse is in heaven later, who will I meet first? If you cry, my baby sibling in your belly will also cry. Mom, just relax. I will meet all of the angels. My grandfather, my grandmother, just like you always told me, and other nice people. Right? Mom, put on my veil for me. You don't have to put on the veil anymore, Honey. No, Mom, I have to. I'm ashamed if I meet the angel I'm bald. Okay, Ayse. Mom, please read the emails of Aunty Hanum's journey again. Okay. "Dear Ayse... Hi, Ayse, how are you? I've bought a lot of refrigerator magnets just like your collection. From Cordoba and Granada, I bet you would like it. If you get well, Uncle Rangga and I will take you to Cordoba. A city with a thousand lights in Europe. You can take pictures of all the beautiful buildings here. Aunty, catch me if you can! Gosh... Someday I can meet you again. Ayse, thank you for being my friend with your mother in Vienna. Our farewell became a new beginning for Uncle Rangga and my life in Vienna. Farewell teaches me to love our loved ones while we can. This year, Uncle Rangga and I will go home to Indonesia for good. I hope one day that I could meet your mother and one of my inspiration, that is you. With love, Aunty Hanum." Ayse... I bear witness - there's no God but Allah. - There's no God but Allah. There's no God but Allah. I bear witness that there is no God but Allah. And I bear witness that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God. I bear witness that Prophet Muhammad is the messenger of God. Please forgive me for not replying your emails these three years, it was my most difficult time. Ayse passed away five months ago. I didn't want her to be treated in Vienna. Let her go back to her homeland and hold her country's pride. Ever since Leon mocked her in school, she always asked about Turkey. Leon sent his regards for Ayse. He's very sorry. He wanted Ayse to go back to school. If Ayse can let go, Fatma can let go, then you have to learn to let go. Ayse... I want to fulfill my promise in the past. That I want to wear veil like you. Now it's the time, Sweetie. I wanted you to put on my veil for the first time. But I was too late. Please forgive me, Dear. Thank you, Sweetie. God has given me His amazing blessings through you. Thank you. There is no God but Allah. Allah is great. God. God. God. God. God. God. Allah the Most Perfect have allowed us with millions other mankind to worship Him. Below this Kaaba monument, millions of us humans pour our hearts and souls to God. I spent three years to find out what makes mankind spark and be alive. As time goes by, going through the highs and lows in this Jabal Nour I hiked to the place where the light first shone. It truly wasn't an easy journey to begin with. As the journey of mankind. When our beloved Prophet Muhammad was told to listen what mankind was obligated to do on this earth. Read, in the name of God, read. Read. Yes, the order to read in the language of universe in the name of God that created it. Europe has taught us that knowledge is bitter. But it will be sweeter than honey in the end. A light that will keep shining throughout the ages. Forever. A light that will stay through civilization and the transformation of the universe. He will keep shining forever.
