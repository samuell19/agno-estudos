Ten years. So what is that? Silk? No, no. Silk is 12. Ah, and lace is 13. It's tin. Ew. You're kidding. It's supposed to symbolize durability. I'm almost afraid to ask what he gave you. He got me a beautiful, vintage tin jewelry box. And inside... -Oh. -Hmm. That's actually very sweet. I know, isn't it? I was impressed. Okay. So what'd you get him? I got him a vintage engraved watch So that our love would always be timeless. At least that's what the salesperson said. -[laughter] -well, I'm sold. That's adorable. You know, abby just got a gorgeous Crystal set for her 15th. No way. They have not been married for 15 years. I feel like they just got married. That's what I said. I, of course, had to ask them What was their secret to a happy marriage. And? What did she say? You really want to know? -Yes. -Yes, please. Spill. Okay. But you didn't hear this from me. -Promise? -Our lips are sealed. Hmm. She gave him... A hall pass. -Nuh-uh. -What-- no. What? What do you mean? Like a-- like a hall pass, hall pass? Oh, you know what I mean. Permission. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So she-- She lets nick sleep with other women? One other woman, one time. -No. -She said It does wonders for her marriage. Oh, come on. [laughs] What? Is it so hard to believe? Look, if you're in a committed relationship And you trust them... I don't know. It doesn't sound like a very committed relationship. Hmm. Oh. My. God. You got one. Beth, you didn't. No. -Ah-- -what? How am I just now hearing about this? I didn't think it was that big of a deal. It is a huge deal. What?

You're out of wine. That's too bad. You're going to miss dessert. I made my famous tres leches cake. -No, you didn't. -I thought you love that cake. I do. But I'm still on this sugar cleanse. What? Wine doesn't count. We've discussed this. More for us, then. I'll be right back. A sugar cleanse, really? Could you be less fun, carrie? Give my compliments to justin on the tres leches. Oh, I will.

[groovy music plays] Beth: What are we drinking to? -Lexi: Freedom. -[laughter] Fair enough. How about you? I'm just happy to be out of that dreadful room. I needed toothpicks to keep my eyes open. I thought that guy would never stop talking. -Another round? -Yes. And I'm buying. I-- I'll just take a soda water. Soda water? Need I remind you that you are away from home, Out with your two very best friends In the whole entire world? Yes. May I remind you that our day starts At 6:30 a.M. Tomorrow. Yeah, but, like, no one goes To those morning sessions. Actually, make that two. -Okay. -Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This is the last time I go out with you two grandmas. -Oh. -I said what I said.

Okay, you guys, I don't want you to freak out. Look over there. [low chatting] Hey, isn't that that guy from the band, icarus? -No way. -Lexi: Oh, yeah. What's his name? Dante. Dante jones. -[gasping] -what? Both: Dante. Dante jones. I had all of their albums when I was in high school. You know, icarus was actually my very first concert. I snuck out with bobby silver and we went To see them play at the pier. Oh. Bobby silver. So scandalous. He should be your hall pass. Oh, not this again. Oh, hell yes, he absolutely should be. What are you doing? Got to take a picture or else it didn't happen. Oh, come on. "I got my hall pass and I am ready To mingle." "mingle?" I hope you're kidding. [lexi chuckling] Lexi. -You better not post that. -Too late. Lexi, take it down now. -It's kind of a cute photo. -I'm not kidding. What if justin sees that? Okay, fine. Fine. Carrie: Stop making jokes about a hall pass, lexi. Times are tough. No one's filling arenas on their own these days. Double, triple headers. That's where the money is. I'm paying you good money to manage me. Maybe if we had the whole band. -Not happening. -Just think about it. This brooding acoustic vibe is-- It's kind of a downer. Yeah, I'm not inspired by that, man. You're not supposed to be inspired. You're supposed to be a-- a misbehaving, Unhinged rock star. Speaking of, could you at least have ordered a beer? You might as well be drinking mineral water. Fine. Where are you going? To get something other than mineral water. Justin and I would never have an arrangement like that. Well, maybe you should. Could be the inspiration you need. I don't even want to be with someone else. It's not about being with someone else. It's the idea of it all. Maybe even help you out of that slump. And this hall pass really helped you? As a matter of fact, it did. You know, you still never told us who you picked. -Lexi: Never. -And I'm never going to. [all laughing] Are people still doing that? -Doing what? -Like hall passes. That's still a thing? Um, apparently. Actually, my friend, here, Was just going to tell us Which celebrities she might be interested in. Ooh, a celebrity, huh? No. No, no, no. Absolutely not. -I'm dante, by the way. -Oh, she knows. You should, uh, join us. Sure. As-- As long as it's all right with-- Carrie. -Carrie's good. -Yeah. Sure. So... Which celebrity we goin' with? It's funny you should mention that. -Lexi-- -dante: Well, I mean... Beautiful woman like yourself, You could choose anyone you want. [beth laughing] oh, right. You know what, on second thought, I think I will have that drink. Lexi: Oh, great. Let's go. -Where are you guys going? -Um... To grab a drink. We might go walk around. No, no, no. Please don't leave me. Beth: If you need a rescue, just call or text me. We'll be close by, okay? All right, you guys. -Dante: All right. -Lexi: Have fun. So, what are you drinking? Oh, uh, just some soda water. I have an early morning. -Uh. Waitress. -Waitress: Uh-huh? Can we get a couple of dirty martinis, please? -Waitress: Right away. -Thank you. Okay. Twist my arm. What? You're just not what I would have expected. Ah, what were you expecting? I don't know. Um... I've listened to all your music And I guess you're just... Completely different than how I always imagined. So you've always imagined me? -[both chuckling] -in what way? I guess I thought you'd be more like Some bad boy rock star. Just really unapproachable. But, uh, you actually seem really easy to talk to. Waitress: Here you go. Thank you. Well... To getting to know each other. Our real selves. [bright instrumental plays] ? Oh, I should probably switch back to soda water. These martinis have gone straight to my head. Yeah, my boy, barry, makes 'em strong. Actually... This been really great But I should probably go up to bed. No. No, no, no. You can't leave now. -[carrie laughing] -come on. Our night's just getting started. You want to, um-- You want to head back there? It looks comfortable. -Sure. -Yeah? After you. Barry, can we get two more? Thanks, man. [bar din] [sighs] Doesn't it get tiring? What? Pretending to be something you're not. [sighs] "I celebrate myself... And sing myself. And whatever I assume... You shall assume." "for every atom belonging to me As good belongs to you." You know walt whitman? What? The father of free verse? He wrote with... No restrictions, Exploring the importance of the everyman. He found beauty in the ordinary world. I don't know, it seems like most people today's idea Of poetry begins and ends with tiktok. [laughter] [bright instrumental plays] This-- this has all been really great. But really, I should have been in bed, Like, two hours ago. You can't leave me now. No, you need to regale me With more stories about the benefits Of electronic insurance claims. [laughing] Fascinating. Come see my suite. I'll call in some champagne. Just one drink. You know, most women... They see the celebrity and... They see the money. But you... It's been a long time since I've connected With someone like you. Dante... I'm flattered, but-- But you can trust me. What if I said I didn't know if I could trust me? I do. One drink? I promise. ? Uh... As much as I would love to, I can't. -Ah, come on. -Thank you... Dante, for... A wonderful evening. My 15 year old self Would never have believed any of this. Good night.

So, you really want to go back To your sad life and your house In the middle of nowhere and your boring job. -Excuse me? -And being that you Even considered a hall pass, I'm going to guess your boring husband. I'm right, aren't I? Oh. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said any of that. That's not me. I promise. -Please forgive me. -Dante. Goodbye. ?

Beth: Are you sure nothing happened with duncan? -Carrie: Nothing happened. -Well, in that case, I'm very proud of you. A lot of women wouldn't have had your self-control. -Right. -Although... You can't tell me you didn't think about it. Hmm. You want some advice? If I said "no," would that really make a difference? No. Take all those thoughts And everything that didn't happen...

Do you really think that little of yourself? That's not what I meant. What you need is someone Who actually appreciates you. You can't tell me that we didn't share a connection, carrie. What are you so afraid of? -I'm not afraid. -You know, I'd never do Anything to jeopardize you or your marriage. Nothing is going to happen between us, okay? I need you to understand that.

Please. ?? I'm sorry to have bothered you. ?? [screams in anger] [engine revs] ?? Quinn: You got to let it go, man. I've been to enough of your shows to know There are women lining up for you by the dozen. You don't need this one. She chose me. Are you sure that's what this is about? -What do you mean? -I mean, Are you sure you're not just Substituting her for someone else you can't have? Is this about brenda again? Forget her. She-- she used me. She was married. And this new one isn't? No, you know, you-- You weren't there, quinn, okay? You didn't-- you didn't see the way that we connected. Quinn: Uh-huh. She could be my soul mate. -Just like last time. -No, this is different. You wanna know what your problem is? Yeah. I'm a romantic? You always go for the women you can't have. It's like a self-destructive pattern with you. You know you're not hearing me, quinn. This-- this girl gets me. She's not even available. It doesn't matter. She said I was her hall pass. Oh, my god. Her hall pass? You're delusional is what you are. And I really hate seeing you do this to yourself. I promise... That this time will be different. This-- this woman is different. She's special. Just-- just come back here, will you? -When I'm done. -Quinn: Dante. -I gotta go. -Quinn: Dante. Goddammit. Um, hi, yeah, I just wanted to make sure that he will, In fact, be attending your show. Yes, that's correct. This Saturday. You know, he attends every year. Big fan, huh? Oh, um, yeah. My friend would be super disappointed If-- if she missed it. Okay, well, I can't make any promises, But I do have him down as a confirmed guest. Okay, so he will be in seattle this weekend. That is good to hear. Thank you.

They were from dante. He was here? It's almost like he's stalking me. Stalking you? Why am I getting the feeling -You don't believe me? -I mean, but come on, Stalking you, that's a bit much, don't you think? Why else would he be here? Well, you said you spent time with him at the bar, right? -Yeah. -And then you saw him -Again backstage? -Yes. What's your point here? Well, it's probably just part of his act, Is what he does. I mean, come on. He's a famous and rich rock star. He's smooth. His only job is to make his fans think That they're important. So what are you saying? I'm not good enough for him? No, come on, you know I didn't mean it like that. Because why would he send me this? Omg! -Let me see that. -No. Is there something you're not telling me? Of course not.

[footsteps thumping] Dante: We had a date. I-- I couldn't get away. Dante: You could have called. You're right. I guess, time got away from me. Dante: Right. Aren't you supposed to be having an appearance somewhere? Dante: You're right, so come with me. -What are you doing? -Dante: I'm trying To figure out what I have to do -To get you to listen to me. -I am listening. Dante: No, you're hiding, brenda. -Brenda? -Dante: Carrie. You're hiding in your backyard While your husband thinks you belong to him. [ominous instrumental playing] -I will go to the police. -Dante: No, you won't. -And why is that? -Dante: Because you're married And you don't want people asking questions, Questions that'll get you in a lot of trouble, carrie. And you wouldn't want me to do anything drastic, would you? What-- what do you mean? [phone chimes] Carrie: Lexi! [gasping] What are you doing? Dante: It's only 8:30, and she's already home. The date must not have gone very well. Oh, have I got your attention now? [panting] Justin: Babe, you missed the best part. -[door slams] -everything okay? Yeah. That was lexi. Apparently, her date was a total disaster. I mean, are you surprised? No. [laughs nervously] But I'm gonna go over there, and just check on her. Yeah, don't wait up. Okay. -[banging loudly on door] -lexi: Okay! Carrie, what are you doing here? It's kind of a long story, you're alone? Unfortunately, yes. The date was a total bust. Did you come to check up on me? [sighs] no-- yes, kind of. Okay, 'cause you never do that. [sighs] I know. I-- I just, I had a feeling. All right, carrie, I have to tell you About this date. This guy was so boring! All he wanted to do was talk about his ex, And yada, yada, yada, and-- What are you looking for? Nothing. I'm just making sure. I promise there's no one in here. Okay, seriously, carrie, You're really starting to scare me. What's going on? Carrie, what's going on? I'm sorry, I just-- I just had a bad feeling, And I-- I never would have forgiven myself If something happened, and I ignored it. Okay. We're okay! We're both okay, right? -Mm-hmm. -It's fine. You want some wine? -Yes. -Let's go inside. [ominous instrumental playing] -[sirens wailing] -[tires screeching] You say you met him while you on a work trip? -Carrie: Yes. -Were you traveling alone? I was with my girlfriends. We all work together. I got very fortunate in the colleagues department. And you told my officers, while you were on the trip That you had an interaction with him in the hotel? -Yes. -When you say interaction... I told him I was a fan, that I loved his music. Did anything sexual happen between the two of you? No. [pen scratching paper] Okay, we-- we kissed and fooled around a bit, But that was it, nothing more than that. He repeatedly asked me To come back to his suite and I refused. And how did he react when you told him -You weren't interested? -Angrily. -Violent? -More verbal. Things got heated very quickly. So after that night, you had no further contact With mr. Murphy? Thomas murphy, dante's real name. Oh, I know what you meant, but no. And then, a month later, You attended one of his shows. Yes, my husband surprised me With concert tickets for my birthday. He knew I was a fan. At some point, during the evening, Did you actively tell him no? Yes. Yes, I absolutely did. [knocking on door] Thank you. Excuse me. [ominous instrumental playing] [siren wailing] We've been able to obtain some footage From the hotel's security cameras As well as your social media profiles. Oh, okay. Did you meet up for a drink in the bar? Well, I wasn't exactly meeting him, I was there having a drink with my two friends. As I mentioned, we were traveling together. Did you know he was gonna be there? No, of course not! "whenever I perform in santa barbara, I always like to stop in at jeff & barry's, My favorite wine bar," it's on his socials. How would I know that? You've tagged "like" on several of his posts. Yeah, I was a fan, but that doesn't mean That I read every article on his page. What about your hall pass? -My what? -Officer: Oh, come on, carrie! You know exactly what I'm talking about. "I got my hall pass, I'm ready to mingle"? Okay, look, I can explain that. That was just a dumb joke. My friend was goofing off. You should know, this department takes False allegations very seriously. False allegations? [ominous instrumental] You-- you brought him in? Actually, mr. Murphy came in on his own. -I don't understand. -I need you to wait for me -In the other room. -Why would he come in On his own? If you would just wait for me-- mrs. Palmer. Sure. [ominous instrumental playing] [tapping on table] Do you mind telling me what's going on? I have a tro. What is a tro? A temporary restraining order? I'll need you to sign at the bottom. [sighs] thank you. I was starting to worry you didn't believe me. Mrs. Palmer, this is A temporary restraining order against you. I'm sorry, what? By signing you're agreeing Not to go within 100 yards of mr. Murphy. I agree not to-- What-- what about my protection? The agreement is valid for 14 days After which time mr. Murphy may file a petition With the court for an extension. He's filing a restraining order against me? But he's been stalking me! We now have an open investigation To gather more information. And in the meantime, if you have an attorney, It might be a good idea to have a chat with them. [sighs] [ominous instrumental playing] Brenda! [upbeat instrumental music playing] ? I used to dream about it every day ? ? hope you're not afraid to look, yeah ? ? I still think about it to this day ? Get you anything? -Just soda water. -Coming right up. You're brenda, right? -Yeah. -Hi. I'm-- I'm carrie palmer. I'm here to talk about dante. [chuckles] you people Just don't know when to give up, do you? What is it this time? A magazine? Podcast? I just need a minute of your time. I need this job, okay? And every time one of you shows up, My boss gets pissed. I'm not a journalist or a crazy fan. I promise. I'll get your soda water. [sighs] You have one minute. I just need to know. Is he dangerous? [brenda sighs] We met at a bar in santa barbara, One thing led to another, I broke it off, and now he's-- Obsessed? [sighs] We met at a party a couple of years ago. He's nothing like his image. He's sweet, sensitive, cultured. Very convincing. Sounds about right. But he's-- he's also possessive. Very possessive. And if-- if you're not careful, He has a temper. Did he ever try and hurt you? I-- I just need to know how scared I should be. Steer clear of him at all costs. Would you believe That he put out a restraining order against me? He-- he told the cops that I was stalking him. He did the same thing to me. Good luck getting anyone to believe you. Dante is a master manipulator Who-- who can charm the police. And-- and they fall for it every time. [johnny clears throat] I need to get back to work. Be careful. Please. [ominous instrumental playing] [sighs] Dante: What did you tell her? [frightening instrumental playing] What did you tell her? You mean, did I tell her how you broke into my house? How you chased me across the country? [screaming] How you broke my arm in a rage. [screams] Johnny: It's closing time, bud. My man, it's time to go. We're closed. [chuckles] Wasn't that that guy from that band? [doorbell jiggles] ?? [tires screeching] [phone chimes] [chuckles] pizza sounds great. -[keyboard clatters] -[phone chimes] [phone chimes] [ominous instrumental playing] Hello. Somebody here? -[grunts] -[footsteps thumping] [car beeps] -[engine starts] -[alarm beeping] -[car door slams closed] -[sighs] [justin grunts, struggles] [doorbell rings] Pizza time. Detective? [sighs] [sirens wailing] Justin: I-- I didn't get a good look. What about his voice? Did he say anything? No. Just the text. [footsteps approaching] I'll be right back. [machine beeping] We have people checking his phone And the cloud backups, But so far, we haven't been able to find anything. -I'm telling you, it's him. -Don't worry. We've already sent someone to talk to him. So you believe me? I go where the evidence takes me, that's all. [sighs] thank you. I'll be back tomorrow morning to see how he's doing. But in the meantime, I think there's some things You and your husband need to discuss. [sentimental instrumental music playing] [sighs] What-- what was that? [sighs] There's something that I need to tell you. Something that I should have told you a month ago. -You're scaring me. -Shh. Just listen. So, when I went on that work trip... Something happened. That night was the one-- [justin sighs] [machine beeping] [sentimental instrumental playing] [car screeches distantly] [justin struggles, grunts] [thuds] [car beeps] Beth: You know, you could have told me the truth. I tried. I know. I'm sorry. Did you not think I would understand? I mean, sure, things got a little out of hand. Out of hand? Look, the most important thing is you didn't do anything. Don't forget that. Yeah. How's justin doing? He's a little better. He was discharged this morning. You talk to him? Not since last night. He won't speak to me. Can't say I blame him. You told him? [sighs] How did he take it? Let's just say I don't think he'll be rushing home any time soon. Just give him some time. Yeah. In the meantime, what about you? [scoffs] -Just processing it all. -You staying at the house? -Yeah. -Is it safe? Well, I'm not allowed Within 100 yards of him, so... He could be anywhere. Look, if you need anything, anything, You let me know. Okay. Thank you. Of course. [sighs] Marilyn? Who-- who left this here? I didn't see anyone. [suspenseful instrumental playing] [sighs] [banging] Hello? Hello? [ominous instrumental playing] [breathing heavily] [birds chirping] [music intensifying] [music stops] -[bird chirping] -[wings flapping] [clattering] [sighs] [frightening instrumental playing] [lock clicks] [outgoing call tone] Hey, it's me. Actually, there is something you can help me with. [harmonious instrumental playing] [camera shutter clicking] [car door clicks open] I hope you're right about this. Don't worry. No, no. I have plans of my own. -Oh! -Oh, yeah. First you're gonna go upstairs, Take a nice, long bath, I have candles lit And a glass of champagne waiting. Wow! Really? You are gonna love my famous salmon.
