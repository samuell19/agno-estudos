MARK: They thought it was a fight. Put him right on that anyway. Doesn't sounds as if you were in a state to know what the fuck went on. [sighs] Well, he couldn't fight anyone. He was legless. Except when he was dancing. You've been dreaming, mate. I don't know who he is. Nothing on him. He's still unconscious, see? Head injuries. Yeah, well you can't do nothing. Just keep out of it. TOUR GUIDE [ON PA]: It firesthe the ESTECH missiles. It carries a helicopter. It's a very fast ship, which is powered by Olympus Rolls Royce engines,which are gas turbines. It gives this ship or this class of ship a speed of around 34 knots. This trip's for your benefit, not mine. I weren't asked. I can think of betterthings to do on my last day ashore than look at bloody ships. I'm cold. Christ. It's the age. Is it? My sister was like that, her age, when she were older than me. Nearly drove me fucking mad. She get better, did she? Don't know. Don't see her no more. TOUR GUIDE [ON PA]: --Cleopatra. This ship was built here, at Plymouth. It carries a helicopter.

I still don't quite believethis is all happening. Ah, well, we can't be lucky every time. You try doing an exchange when you want to be away for a few months. It's a doddle. There's blokes queuing up to stop you for your shore posting. But it's harder this way 'round, love. Oh, it'll be all right. You're never going to wear them are you? Of course I am. The sun shines all the time on the West Coast. Beach Boys, all that stuff. You look like a bloody puff. Laid back. That's what these are, my son. Laid back. [laughs] Drink up young Malcolm White. Your round next. Oh, I'm taking it easy. Fucking skinned from last night. Not matching vodkas with that mom of yours? You naughty fellow. [music playing] Who's winning? It's a bit hard to say, at the moment. You going past to Plymouth? Penzance. MALCOLM: That's nice. You sisters? No. MALCOLM: I like Cornwall. It's nice there. When were you in Cornwall then? Holidays. Yeah. yeah, went there every summer as a kid. It's really good. Whereabouts did you stay? Uh-- it's um-- it's a littleplace near the St. Ives. Nice, uh, cottage was it, eh? Wake in the morning to the cry of the gulls? [laughs] In college? Yes, that's right. MALCOLM: I bet you're older than me. I've been in the navy since I was at school. I'd say they were younger. It's your round. You all right, Steve, our son? Yeah, of course. You're doing well. I was having a drink withSean McKay last night. Oh yeah? Mm. Of course he'd been upset. Well, he's very upset aboutyou and that bird of his. Sue, is it? Look, I'd leave it out if I was you. Well, last night ashore and all. Look, it's all finished between her and McKay. She told me. Well, if you sees you downUnion Street with her tonight, he'll have you. He's a fucking nutter. He can be a bit of a nasty. OK, it's just you're going on the ship with him come tomorrow,whether you like it or not. So what? He can't do nothing there, can he? Come on. Right. Let's get on with it. Yeah. [gulls squawking] MARIE: If you're waiting for the Spanish Armada, you've missed it. Look, we come into town for a nighter. He spent five minutes in my club. Why am I a fucking villain? It was him who threw up all over you, wasn't it? Yes, Stan. Wasn't it? That doesn't mean hedeserves to end up in hospital. I'm sorry about the boy. Really, I am. That's not good enough, Stan. I mean, they're allstill there, aren't they? Frank and his like, your employees? They're all still there,getting ready for another night. And I suppose the hospital's getting ready for another night too. Marie, love, both sides get hurt in a war. MARIE: Oh, yes, right. The wards fill up withinjured bouncers, do they? Oh, for Christ's sake. MARIE: Oh, you know that's not true. You're just trying to makeout it's a fair fight. Well, it's bloody well not a fair fight. Most of them are too drunkeven to defend themselves. They start it every fucking time. I know what they're like. One of them happens to be my son. It's no answer, Stan. It's no answer at all. I mean, suppose it was Vincent,lying out there with his face all smashed in. What would I say? That boy of yours hasn'tbeen in my club for two years. That's how much he hates me. Remember? Just be thankful for small mercies. TOUR GUIDE [ON PA]: This complex was only completed, handed over to the Royal Navy, around two years ago. It was opened by Prince Phillip. Thank you, my dear. I hope Rolls' scrap willpay for the deaths in there. Surface ships are a waste of time. A glamour they are, icing on the cake. Eh, Jill? I went around this sub last year, navy days. Stink, didn't they? They don't. Anyway, I reckon I'd go around the bend if I was stuck in one of them for months on end. Crews do go around the bend. You can recognize deep straight off. That and the round shoulders. [laughs] Do you go in subs? Wouldn't mind. Don't get to see the light ofday much on the frigate, do I? Besides, don't always get the choice. How do you mean? Well, you can't get the numbers, see? They draft you from the surface to the subs. As long as you fit your end, there ain't no two ways about it. I'm going for fresh air. Found our little sea legs, have we? I got to go up the hospital this afternoon, see about that bloke. They want me to talk to him. Creepy, isn't it? Frank ditched his wallet. There's no identity on him. What's the police attitude? Usual. Don't want to know. He is serious, is he? Cold, man. Shit. Police might change theirattitude you know, if he dies. I'm not an idiot, Al. The MP's are asking questions. Yeah? It's the identity thing. The hospital are making the run. They'd leave it aloneotherwise, wouldn't they? Frank's such a bloody fool. He panicked. Helped himself to some cash, more like. Stupid boy. Stupid little idiot. He should never have been there. OK, Al, thanks. Keep in touch, all right? OK, Stan. [chatter] I'm sorry I got to go. Go? Go where? The hospital. Well, I got a mate had an accident at work. I said I'd visit. This is our last daytogether for six months, Mark. I'm sorry. I promised I would. Well, how long are you going to be? I'm buggered if we-- Well it won't be long, dad. I'm buggered if we're going to just stay here while you go off visiting. Well you can go to the Barbican, can't you? MARK'S MOTHER: Perhaps we should go home. I like the Barbican. There's that tea shop we went to once. I know the one. MARK'S MOTHER: Oh, I don't care for that. Oh, go on, mum. Half past 3:00, all right? OK. That's settled then. NAVAL OFFICER: Maybe he isn't navy. But he's certainly military personnel. Well, put calls out to theother services then, can't you? I want his parents here. Do you understand? I want somebody who knows him really well. Well, he could be crucial. [machines beeping] You were as drunk as he was. Is that the problem? He's not my mate or anything. He didn't talk much. Who else were you with? Just a couple of birds. Do you remember then? Yeah. Talk to him about them. Mark, please try. Do you remember the two birds I was with? You bought them a drink or two. One was-- well, she was awful, wasn't she? The other weren't so bad. They were waiting forsomeone, they keep saying. Do you remember? No one ever come. Ask him questions. You kept saying you were a good dancer. Do you remember how you keptsaying you were a good dancer? And I kept saying-- I kept saying, you ought to go and dance then? Didn't I? You went and danced. I fell asleep. I do that when I'm pissed. But you kept on about something. Something you wanted to do,something you wanted to be. I wanted to be a farmer. It was like that. Something you wanted to be. You know, when you're a kidand you want to be something. Like a fireman or spaceman, or something. You know?

Plymouth does well out of the Navy. Lived here for years. Worked in the dockyards. I've seen it grow. Yes, Plymouth does well out of the navy. Did well out of the war too. Bombed flat, wasn't it? Bombs don't destroy money. Good life, in the Navy. I had a lad in the navy. Good life. Sailed all over the world. Got in a few scraps, mind. Goodness me. Had a wife in every port, I don't doubt.

[LAUGHING] Well, thatexplains your bad temper. Look, he knows when I'm here. He knows when I'm ashore. MARIE [ON PHONE]: Vinny, what's the matter, love? He'd know if I didn't ever write to him again. He'd look it up in the paper,see where my ship docked, find out which ship I were--he'd phone the fucking Admiral of the fleet. Vinny, please. Hello? I'm sailing tomorrow morning. MARIE [ON PHONE]: If onlyyou'd contacted me a week ago. Why the hell haven't you contacted me? Mum? MARIE [ON PHONE]: What? Come into town. We could have a meal or something. It's a problem.

Doreen at the Two Trees said I'd find you here. Oh yes. I'm trying to find out about this bloke who got beaten up last night. Doreen is Mr. Andrew's daughter, yes. This-- this bloke down atThe Antelope, he said that she knows what goes on like. Mr. Andrews is a good man. He has charge of the sailor's rest home. Aggie's, Aggie Weston's. I've been there. Mr. Andrews is a man of God. Well, Doreen said you'd help me. She said-- Have you given in to God almighty? Have you, my child? Look, please-- JOE: Look, you've no right, you see. There've been many goodChristian men here in Plymouth. They have broken bread together for centuries. Did you know that now? Men of steel. In Plymouth we've beenblessed in having such men. Many, many have worshiped, my child. But many have been just so much cordage. And when the devil hassent his storms, his gales of hard times, his-- his reign of grief, many have frayed, worn, and rotted away. But the ship holds. It does not break from its moorings. It does not drift to destruction. Because the men of steel hold the ship of God. Here in Plymouth, in the midst of so much evil, drunkenness, and all manner of sin, there are men of steel, you see? This bloke, he's in a coma. The hospital, when I went up there, they said that he had nothing on him. And they don't know who he is. They don't know who he is. What has this little tragedy to do with me? MARK: You've got his wallet. Well Doreen says you have! It was in the dustbin. Heh? [MUSIC - THE ROLLING STONES, "LITTLE T&A"] [chatter] Evening, John.

Wants to talk to you outside. Oh, right. Sorry, John. I expect I'll be back. [music playing] What you want? Your mum rung me. Look, for fuck's sake! VINCENT'S FATHER: Now, listen. There's trouble down the disco. And you heard about that, didn't you? Vaguely, yeah. There's retaliation being planned. I want you to keep out the way. You're a bit too close in. You understand? Look, I don't think my mumbeing shagged by the gaffer puts me very close in at all. Do you? Good old dad! Dad, can I borrow your car? Tonight? It's important, really important. You'll be careful now? [keys jingle] Ta. [music - the police, "roxanne"] [SINGING] You don't have to put on the red light. you don't have to put on the red light. Hello? Is that Exeter's 34427? Yeah.

STEVE: What's wrong with that? You know the rules. What rules? Don't get funny with me, son. [radio chatter] We've got to find some bloke. Tonight? You've got to be joking. Priority. We've got to find him andbreak some bad news and all. STEVE: Right. May as well be in a fucking cage. All right. [laughs] [chatter] Go on, Steve. You said we could. I didn't. You did. You said we could at the restaurant. OK. Hey, Mal, see you later, yeah? [radio chatter] [doorbell rings] [chatter] Have you got an invitation? Yes. After you. Hi, Nick. - Hello.

[chatter] In sailor. I didn't mean to be rude. I thought you were looking rather superior. I am. TEACHER: That's a bit arrogant, isn't it? What do you want? I don't want anything. Are you sure? TEACHER: You don't give a damnabout any of us here, do you? You've come waltzing in here inthe tow of some girl or other, thinking you'll drink ourdrink and eat our food, and then you'll trot off backto the strip clubs or wherever, and have a good laugh about itall with your little toughie sailor friends. I haven't had quite asmuch to drink as you have. And what do you do for a living? I'm a teacher. Well, I'm in the Navy, see? And that's where-- TEACHER: I know that. Shut up. I said, that's work of national importance. That's why we can't go on strike. That's why we have tosign on for fucking years. With the you money earn, Ican't imagine you'd want to. I don't want to, as a matter of fact. I'm proud of what I do. Very commendable. Just listen, you. You don't have any idea, do you? Oh, piss off. Listen. Tomorrow I have to spend I don'tknow how many fucking weeks floating around in some steel box, all in the cause ofdefending frustrated old bags like you from the communist menace. I know what you are. None of that, thank you. You're one of those C&D wankers, aren't you? I want you out of here! She's getting in my nose! You ought to be grateful, you bitch!

And that's where he stayed last night, in Exeter, a friend or something. He went from Birmingham to Exeter yesterday. And he had his walletstolen in a service area, he reckons on the M5. So that receipt can't be his. Continental Hotel, see, yesterday's date. His wallet, but not his receipt. I see. You know about the bloke I'm looking for? He stole the wallet, did he? I don't know. MP: Well, it seems probable, doesn't it? MARK: He got done over in theback of Doll's last night. He's in the Royal, in a coma. Nobody claimed him, I gather? Well, that's why I brought the wallet. It all helps, doesn't it? I don't know. I'm not sure I care. Bloody navy, bloody UnionStreet, pain in the ass, the lot of it. What's that? Circus ticket.

Well, if you're so suresomething's going to happen, why don't you just shut up shop for the night? For God's sake, woman, what doyou think you're talking about? One night like this there's up to 1,000 of them in Union Street. Bloody hell, I lose money nightafter night in that place. All right, all right, forget I said anything. I mean, we both make a livingoff of my business, don't we? We both benefit. Oh Jesus, I've had it up to here from you today. MARIE: All right. STAN: The street's dying bit by bit anyway. There's people I could name in this city, just biding their time, waitingto knock the old lot flat, put up car showrooms,do-it-yourself supermarkets. Why don't you just shut up? Mind you, come to think of it, cars are rather dangerous aren't they? Perhaps I shouldn't sell them. Shut up. And what about do-it-yourselfelectrical saw attachments? They're real killers. It's all blood money, Marie. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up! [glass shatters] Ah! [car driving away] [music playing] I'm gonna miss you, Stevie. I told you before, don't call me Stevie. Steve.

Ferry's going to dock in a minute. You OK? Maybe it was cause I sort of recognized him. I didn't really know Malcolm White. He was just leaving Raleighwhen I started there. But he was at that RemembranceDay service we had to go to. It was his brother who wasin the Army Display team. I must've recognized him in some weird way. That's why I started talking to him and that, you know, down at Dol's. Found out he'd gone AWOL from his camp is Dorset, hitched all the way to Plymouth. Well, he was scared to go home. So he came down here to find his brother. That's why he was hangingaround on his own. He didn't know anyone. He was too scared to say who he was. That's the brother, is it? Yeah, Malcolm. Yeah. You know, I do know him. I mean, vaguely. NAVAL OFFICER: Come on, lads, ferry's leaving. Can you see this gets to White? He's the one up at the hospital. He's still there, isn't he? His brother died during the night. NAVAL OFFICER: Right, I'll see to it. You mean he's dead? Christ. Why'd he go AWOL? Don't know. Leave canceled or something. After Belfast, probably. Perhaps it was just to say cheerio. That's important sometimes. [music playing]
