Naoki-san, you will wed this woman, and according to God's decree, will become a married couple. You will, in sickness and in health, love her and honor her, comfort her and cherish her, and protect her, until death do you part, whilst forsaking all others, do you solemnly pledge? I do. Rika-san, you will wed this man, and according to God's decree, will become a married couple. You will, in sickness and in health, love him and honor him, comfort him and cherish him, and protect him, until death do you part, whilst forsaking all others, do you solemnly pledge? I do. You may kiss the bride. Get a pose! Here goes! Rika actually married... You're surprised? Of course. Leaves her six-year boyfriend, marries in three months?! How about you and Keita? Those going to the next party, it's that way! It's that way! Let's go to it. I'll go home. Why? You're going! Don't touch me. Miki, come on, let's go! How about the party? Let's take a walk. Rika looked lovely. That dress suited her. Actually... I have to talk to you. I still remember them. All the days since we first met. Over and over, valued as if they're a treasure. I thought that my future was connected to yours. THE SIGNS OF LOVE I've had enough of this! Enough! Impossible! How long will we wait?! Groom has appendicitis! He can't come! Well, director? Director, what now? It's OK! It's alright. I'll find somebody. I hadn't planned to be in a film. Sorry, I got you involved. It's not your fault. Keita... Mino? What's with that outfit? Nothing. Got some free time? No, I have to... You are free! I see you've got lots of time. Come this way. What for? Be happy! It's time for your wedding ceremony. Mino! Groom, Keita Fukushima. Bride, Sayaka Miyamoto. Time for a take! Hello. Hello. Excuse me! Bride and groom, please hold hands! And... action! Please... Thank you. OK, start! See you. See you. Excuse me. A revolving door. Oh, thanks... It's not a compliment. I see... Thanks for the other day. My pleasure. My first time to marry. And my first time in a wedding dress. What will you use that for? A church. A church?! Amazing! Hey, did you make everything? Not everything. This the church? That's the church. Hey, what? When the morning sun hits it, the floor becomes a starry sky. No stars are in the noon sky, but if the sunlight is skillfully used, maybe that can be expressed... Your mouth is gaping. Sorry, bad habit. It opens when I'm serious. That's weird. But stars aren't usually visible from Tokyo. If you go to a high place outside the city, there are lots. Really? I'd love to go. Let's go together? Huh? Can we talk now? Can we talk right now? Hello... Do it. Hello, sorry to interrupt you! Oh, I guess phone calls always interrupt... Fukushima? Of course I remember. Really? I'd love to go. Hold on tight! It's dangerous. Amazing! So many stars! Your mouth's gaping. But, mine was too, when I first came here. Now I understand! Coming here inspired that church model. That's not it? That was inspired by Gaudi's work. Gaudi? Don't know him? His Sagrada Familia Church? It's kind of shaped like this... He's my favorite architect. He was an amazing person, and even 100 years later his works seem innovative, his themes are so universal... What is it? Do you want to know? About what? It's a secret. Come on, tell me! I'm not telling. Keita, this seat's empty! Sayaka, who's he? Keita Fukushima. Architecture, 2nd year. He seems nice. Sayaka, thanks for the other day. I haven't met you before. I'm Keita's friend, Minoru Hirao. Nice to meet you. I'm Miki Muramoto. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you! So, Sayaka, what do you like about Keita? You went on a date, right? Did you, Sayaka? You fool, what's this about?! You went to look at the starry sky, right?! It's night, there are stars... (##) I won't do as my parents say, I just can't live without you. (##) Summer, the two of us on a bike Tossed about by city winds "Five taps on the helmet" "Always means" "You Are My True Love" "Instead of words" "My heart sometimes reveals a dream" "Of what the future holds" "Squeezing your hand in mine" "I am there" "Merry Christmas" "Probably I'll still upset you" "With my usual selfish ways" "But just like this, forever" "I want to always stay beside you..." You are my true love. What? I couldn't hear. You... are... my... true... love. "Hold me... So tight." Let's see, agencies... I found publishers! That's what you wanted. Better take notes. What? After I found it for you. I was thinking maybe I'd not enter publishing. What do you mean? Maybe I'll do general office work. Don't give up just because a few places rejected you. What should I do? You surprised me! I'm the surprised one. Sagrada Familia? It's always so beautiful. I want to see it for real. I want to become Gaudi. I don't think you can become Gaudi, but let's go... and see it for real. After job hunting's done, as our graduation trip. What?! You're too loud. We're really here. Right! Let's cross. Let's go! There! Sagrada Familia. He's good. Really. Strawberries! Strawberries? Look good. - So cheap! - Yeah, for a kilo! Tomatoes... Not for me! Rock, Paper, Scissors! I lost. - Too heavy? - Too... light. You almost said? James Bond. Not Harrison Ford? James Bond! He's stopped. He moved! He stopped. Amazing! He's not moving. The Spanish sky is pretty, isn't it? Yeah I'm so glad we came. Keita, tell me about Gaudi. So, do you think I'm selfish? Yeah But you love me anyway? Yeah You'll love me forever, right? Yeah It's been fun. Hey, that's a Gaudi building, right? Yeah We'll leave Gaudi tomorrow. So, let's go see Sagrada Familia once more tomorrow. It's said that Sagrada Familia will take over 100 years to complete. Gaudi oversaw the construction for 40 years while still designing it, but only part was built during his lifetime. He entrusted the remaining part to those coming after him. It's him! Yoshiro Nakajima. Who's that? The only Japanese stone carver at Sagrada Familia. Excuse me, Nakajima-san? I'm studying architecture, I'll join a design office next spring. I read your book. This is my favorite building in the world. Actually... I'd like to ask a favor. Amazing. An angel? When will this be completed? In about 10 years. That long?! When carving, it's as if the stone guides me. I forget what day it is, and all sense of time is gone. I hear nothing around me, and feel as if I have no body. I feel as if I'm inside the stone. So 10 years is not so long. The plans Gaudi drew have almost all been destroyed, but strangely, contemporary experts... can sense the kind of church that Gaudi intended. Even more than paper plans, something great exists. That was his dream of what the future held. Dream of the future... I want to see Nakajima's completed angel soon. Let's come to see it together, 10 years from now. That's not good enough. In 10 years, let's come to see it hand in hand. There's no difference! It's completely different, you fool! On the way home from Spain, we looked together out of the plane's little window. Keita said, "I'll make a building like that cloud." It?ll soon be the third spring since graduation. As always, Keita's smiling face is radiant beside me. The turtle he gave me is also three years old. Actually, the turtle is more like me than Keita. Hosoki Printing, Operations Division. Thank you for calling. Section head Sakurai, call on line 5, Aida warehouse. Say I'm not here. But they call every day, and seem to be in trouble. - Just tell them I'm away on business! - But... And check this file to make sure there are no misprints. Thanks. Sorry to keep you waiting. Sakurai is away on business. Please accept my apologies. Goodbye. Thanks. Don't worry about callers. It's easier if you think they're not real people. Hosoki Printing, Operations Division. This should feel more open. Yes, I see. Yamashita-san... How about including this rib structure in this facade? Oh, a curtain wall. Some ribs do seem good. Right. Thank you. You need to do more than respond. Next time, bring me your own work, I'll critique it. Yes! Sorry to be late! Too late! I'm sorry. I'm starving, let's go. Ok. This is good! It is! Come back to Fukuoka for your dad's death memorial. Come back. OK, OK. By the way, how's your job? Average. Hear her? 'Average.' I'll talk that way, 'average.' Don't tease her. So, how's your boyfriend? I can't imitate that... Asuka, I hope you meet someone nice soon. True love is the most important thing in life. Mother, you're more girlish than either one of us! Of course I am. If you have true love, even a tough job will be OK. You're probably right. Not 'probably,' definitely. Excuse me. Almond tofu, please. Sayaka... You arriving late will make me fat. Sorry. You've left the skin again. Excuse me, Oolong tea. I see. My boss stopped me as I was leaving. I see. My boss is involved in designing a theater now. It's amazing, much better than anything I could do. Seeing the plans is exciting. Keita, what are you designing? I'm still just an assistant. I prepare applications and visit sites and bureaus. I want to see a building designed by you soon. So do I. Sayaka, how's your job lately? Well, average. What's 'average'? It's average! Don't worry about me. Sorry, excuse me. Hello, Fukushima here. Yeah Sayaka... It seems you're not enjoying your job. Sayaka, when you began job hunting, didn't you look for editorial work? Don't you still want to do editing? Good night. Good night. See you. Thank you. In your university days, what did you hope to become? I wanted to do editorial work. To convey my interests or new ideas... to a lot of different people. But people are interested in different things. What are some things that interest you? People, for example. Taking a close-up look at people's personalities... provides a chance to experience their lives. I see, their lives... What is a good life for Sayaka Miyamoto? I want to support those in pursuit of their dreams. Miyamoto-san, what is your dream? As I mentioned, to work in publishing. So if you get hired, your dream's fulfilled. Then what? Won't life become boring? A dream doesn't end when it is fulfilled. What? Fulfillment continues. You're interesting! But dreams are not so easily fulfilled. Reality is not as kind as you think. But don't people... But don't people keep trying to fulfill their dreams, even while knowing how hard it will be? No one should laugh at someone else's dream. There are various dreams and various people, that makes life interesting. Let's go downtown! Goodnight. Thanks. Take care. Asuka, bring in the plants. OK. Hello, Miyamoto speaking. It's Sayaka. Did you close already? Just now. Is something wrong? Not really. That can't be. Whenever you call me, it's because there's a problem. Mother, you really know me. Your hunt for a new job isn't going well? I quit my job on impulse, but maybe it was a mistake. Publishers aren't hiring people like me. My future looks pretty bleak. What are you talking about?! You watched as your father changed jobs. Everyone was against him quitting his job to start this little place. It was a tough time, but your father saw what the future held. That's why I believed in him. What can you do if you don't have faith in yourself? Well, it's late. Go to sleep. Good night. Hello, Miyamoto speaking. Yes, that's me... Is it true?! Thank you so much! Yes. Congratulations. Let's celebrate. It's pretty. You know... Yes? I've been thinking lately... Yes? If your resolve is strong enough, dreams are fulfilled. Let's fulfill our dream of what the future holds. I'll join "Tickle" editing from today. My name is Sayaka Miyamoto. Please welcome me. I'm Yoshida. You'll work with me. I'll do my best. I look forward to seeing your work. Yes! You need 30? Of course. Also, please mail this. Yes! You haven't been off lately. Take next Sunday off. Yes! I'm going. See you later. Begin shooting with that shirt. Yes. Let's get started. What's a key point? Please feature the collar opening. Yes! Here's your order. Where?! Near the end. Near the end? Page 27. "By Sayaka Miyamoto" Congratulations. We sure took a lot of pictures! It's over a period of five years. Let's take even more from now on. Spain? You said that you like Gaudi's work. I thought you'd be pleased. Yeah... 'Yeah' is a poor response! Get ready. You may stay a while. Maybe this should be less arched... Miyamoto! Find material for an article. Yes. Mino came too? Hi Sayaka, it's been a while. You're even more pretty. Beer OK? Excuse me, beer. I expected just you. Sorry, but Mino insisted on coming. It's OK. Rika's wedding is soon. I wanted to discuss what present we should give together. Mino, you're so considerate. Kind of. Maybe a film montage of pictures from our university days? Forget that idea! It was just a suggestion... I'd be glad to get just a simple photo album. So would I. You two get along well. When you get married, I'll make an album for you. Thanks. But it may have to wait, since Keita's going to Spain. What?! Mino! Oh... washroom... I was going to tell you. It seems that someone over there liked my design. They've invited me to go to Spain. Keita, that's good news. I was always sure that you're really good. I don't know how long I'll stay. At least three years. What'll I do? Welcome. Looking for something? Naoki-san, you will wed this woman, and according to God's decree, will become a married couple. You will, in sickness and in health, love her and honor her... Here goes! Rika looked lovely. That dress suited her. Actually... I have to talk to you. Yes? After much thought, I've decided not to go to Spain. But why? You ask why? You should go. Keita, it's been your dream. It's Spain! It's Gaudi! You will fulfill your dream. But... I won't be able to see you. We will meet, it's not like we'll die. If I get a vacation, I'll see you. Same for you. I can't get a vacation. Sayaka, you can't either. We can't be connected just by thinking of each other. I'll worry about you. And most of all, I want you to be close to me. Even if I stay in Japan, I can study. So I'll stay here, and be with you. Sayaka? It doesn't matter if you're in Japan or overseas, I don't want to be with you forever. You're fine as a boyfriend, but I'll marry someone with a better income, who's more reliable. You wanted to marry me? If you'd intended to get married, we shouldn't be together... After that, Keita called me several times, but I never answered. I deleted his name from my phone, and the tears began to flow. I hadn't imagined a future without Keita. I hated my waiting for his calls, so had my number changed. But still I spent my days as if somehow waiting. Before I knew it, five years had passed. Good morning. Good morning. Hirata, is the sweets page OK? Yes Miyamoto... Yes Can you help with that? Yes. Sayaka, thanks. How's your fireworks project? Haven't gathered material yet? I'm sorry. Is Inoue-san here today? Inoue-san is in the drying shed. Thank you. Inoue-san... You've come again? Please, I want to hear your... I said I can't help you. But I... Please, Inoue-san. Please... How did it go? So, find a new project. But I want him to be my topic. The Internet says his fireworks make love come true. A master... But he turned you down. Just find something else. We can't publish blank pages. Upset? No... Maybe you're too optimistic. Good evening. It's healthy to commute by bike. When is your day off? Enough. You can catch a taxi on that main road. Thank you. Actually, to be honest, I don't believe your fireworks make love come true. But it's what people say about your fireworks, Inoue-san, that makes you interesting to me. I'm sure that what I'm saying will make you more hostile... The way you are, nobody will help. Right... Daddy! You're still awake? Come on. Is he your son? Yeah. How unusual, you're still awake, that's strange... Kohei! Kohei, come inside. I'll be in soon. Kohei. Come inside. Who is she? She wants to write about me. I said no. You should let her write. Write about "Fireworks Master Abandons Family." How are you? Miyamoto, did you finish the cosmetics page article? I'm sorry, I'll finish it today. 'Today' ends in one hour. I'm sorry. Miyamoto, your project hasn't been approved. Always going to the fireworks place is a problem. OK? I'm sorry. Which models will you feature? For the page 3-$ full spread, it's Yoko and Rina. Yoko and Rina? They're popular lately. That's right. They're hard to get. Thanks to me. Good. Thanks. I'll keep working on page 2. That sounds fine. Right. Sometimes seeing you makes my heart ache. You're the type that hates to give up. How can you tell? Isn't there some lost love that you can't forget? It's obvious looking at you. If you can't see yourself, you won't be able to see others. Well, there could be love without forgetting about someone else. But you'd have to choose your lover carefully. Come to think of it, I'd be the perfect choice. Don't say such a boring joke. Excuse me. What?! I have a meeting with Tanaka at 4:00 PM. I'm sorry. Tanaka is out of the office. OK, then may I have his phone number? I'm sorry, I can't give it to you. Mino, what work do you do now? I work in film distribution with someone I know. Movies? My magazine can do something. Instead of that, there's something I've wanted to say to you. About Keita. You know, Keita... hasn't even visited Japan. He works hard in Spain. Really... good. It's not good. You don't know how he felt before going to Spain. You just thought of yourself, Keita's the one that suffered! Why did he fall for someone like you? You don't understand how great he is! No one understands Keita better than I do! Good morning! Good morning! Keita Sorry, were you waiting? No, are things behind schedule? This part's difficult. We need workers. I understand. I'll try to get a budget increase. It's to build it right for you. Sorry... It's a compliment. Oh, you're here. Sorry to keep bothering you. Your face makes me think I'm the nuisance. You never get tired of it. I don't get tired of it. I've known this since I first came to Spain. Knowing that it will become part of this church is thrilling. Let's go eat? Well... I want to look at it a bit more. As you like. Let's go to lunch You're Inoue's... Kohei Inoue! Kohei, good afternoon. Good afternoon. Are you going alone to the studio? There's still a long way to go. Tomorrow is kindergarten sports day. I want Daddy to come no matter what. So I'm going to go tell him. Well, I can tell him for you. Really?! OK, promise. Good! Kohei, by himself?! Yes, I have a message from him. He wants you to come to sports day tomorrow. Why wasn't I told about it? You wouldn't come anyway. That's not so... Like the cherry blossoms, the school play... It was because of work. That's why I didn't tell you, so you can focus on your work. Anyway, back to work. Hello. I finally got through! Stop calling from public phones! I didn't know who was calling. Alright? I'm busy with proofreading. What did you call about? I just wondered if you're OK. That's all you wanted? Well, there is more, but... Actually, there's something I want you to get. There were shoes in your magazine that I can't get here. You want me to bring them to you? I can't go there. I'm too busy. I've got to go. I'll call you when I have time. Sorry Kohei, I forgot to tell your father. It'll be OK. Huh?! Inoue-san, why are you here? I can't get there in time. You can still make it, let's get going! I still have work to do. Kohei wanted you to attend so much that he was going to walk here alone! He trusts you, and he's waiting. Let's go right now! Ready! Go! Keep at it, Kohei! Daddy! Thank you! Get back to it. OK! I'll have time for you soon. You mean... Thanks for today. Hello. Asuka? Let's... This is Mother's operation day! What?! Mother phoned you, didn't she? But... she didn't mention her health. How long? Huh? How long will you stay here? I have to return to Tokyo by noon tomorrow. I'm sorry. You think only of yourself. The doctor said she'll recover, but... You've become thin... Is your mother OK? Yes, thanks for your concern. How about you? What? Are you alright? I'm alright. Sounding tough, as always. "Sayaka Miyamoto" "Yoko Miyamoto" It's been years since I wrote you a letter. I'm sorry that I didn't tell you about my illness. It was a shock at first, so I didn't know what to say. But while lying in the hospital bed, I realized I must express something more important than illness to you. Chances to express such things are so few, aren't they? The 30 years since I married and gave birth to you... have been so happy that I feel blessed by God. Sayaka, thank you for allowing us... to have been your parents. One more thing, Sayaka, I want you to... live your life without regret. For that reason, if you encounter something important to you, by using words or letters or your facial expression, I want you to really express it. If you express it in this way, Sayaka, you will become surrounded by a lot of things important to you. Internet blogs say that seeing your fireworks makes love come true. Why do you think that rumor started in the first place? In my case, the very first fireworks I made... were created for a person that I truly loved. Then, I proposed to her beneath those fireworks. Was that person your wife? I believed that fireworks have great power, so kept on making them and thought of nothing else. I finally realized that I'd neglected my family. You have to be committed to make good fireworks. I think of nothing else when making fireworks. I thought they'd understand that. I thought that... a married couple share the same ideas... Sorry, this talk won't make an article. You need fireworks talk. I just had a good idea. Why not make fireworks for... that important person once more? So simple... There are so few chances to express things that are important. You must say things when you have the chance. That's what my mother told me. Thanks so much for today. My pleasure. Actually, rather than large-scale fireworks, I prefer sparklers. A long time ago, I held them with someone I liked. I've never seen prettier fireworks than that. I'll make sparklers for you. Will you really?! Miyamoto speaking. Mother? Please leave a message or reservation after the beep. It's Sayaka. Let's see... I'm sorry I couldn't really visit you in hospital. And thanks... for the letter. Mother... I'll... really deal with my feelings... I'll try my best. "From a High School Girl's Blog: 'Love Come True Fireworks'" Here. It's interesting. Thank you! It's done. Finally done! Good work. Also, I'm sorry it's so sudden, but may I take one week off? You won't get another paid holiday until a year from now. Thank you! Departing from Narita Airport on June 23rd, bound for Frankfurt. After arriving, you'll take a connecting flight to Barcelona... Are you? Japanese? Only authorized people can enter. I'm sorry. I really wanted to see this angel. I came before, on a graduation trip. Sorry to intrude. I guess... within two more years. What's wrong, Keita? Nothing. She reminded me of someone. Well, what a surprise! I come back, Mother. Mother, how's your health? I feel fine. Why are you here? This place is so relaxing. Maybe I'll come back here and work for you. What's that?! I didn't advertise for staff. Oh, isn't that? Right. I divided it. They've grown well. Why not take one? Is it OK? Of course, you're the one that gave it to me. How many years ago? Fifteen years? I guess I was still in junior high school. But the original root has withered. Well, these are its 'babies.' Plants are wonderful. They seek out the sunlight for their own benefit. They really know what they need. It's so enjoyable to look after these 'babies.' Thanks again. You say that now? Because I want to say it now. Mother... I... Sayaka, here. Eat before it gets cold. Tasty... Of course! Mother... Teach me to make chicken stew. Ok! We'll begin with the carrots. I do the cutting part?! Of course! Next, maybe you'll do tomorrow's preparations. Impossible! Mother? Let's all go for a trip together. There are so many places I want to go to. Don't take off the chicken skin! But I don't like skin. Don't be so picky! Yes. Hey, Keita. I came to bother you. Bother me anytime. After two more years. That reminds me, a woman dropped in here before and said that. Something about seeing it on a graduation trip. Hello. Mino. Keita, it's been a while. Good morning! How are you? Sorry it's so sudden, but I need to know something. What is it? Do you know how Sayaka's doing? Oh... I saw her recently. Really?! She's in the "Tickle" editing section. Seems pretty busy. I see... Keita, I'm sorry. Huh? I told her you got married... What for? Kind of revenge for what she said, I got carried away. That's getting too carried away! I'm really sorry. Found it! Sorry, I'll call back later. "Dream of What the Future Held" The master of Soen Fireworks Studio, Takumi Inoue, makes fireworks that are getting a lot of attention. It began with a high school girl's blog that said, "Love comes true under his fireworks." Research revealed something strange. Many couples have fallen in love on the night... they watched his fireworks. The very first fireworks that Inoue made... were created for the one he loved. He proposed beneath them, and she became his wife. Fireworks expressed his love to that most precious one. For those happy lovers under the night sky, it depicted a dream of what the future held. Tickets for Inoue's fireworks. One for me. Thank you. Three for you. Thanks. Please come. Editor in chief. Please come to it. Keita! Mino?! Here. You made them for me? I'll treasure them. Don't do that, use them. Also... Will your wife and Kohei be coming? I'm sorry... Please help, I really must meet Sayaka Miyamoto. Miyamoto works under me. I really must meet her. Thank you for coming. Please go to the special seats on the upper level. Thank you. See you later. It's good the weather's nice. Yes. You're here too? Kohei, good afternoon. I read the magazine article. Forgive my intrusion. No need to apologize. It was a great article. Thank you. Get going. Mino, thanks. Kohei. Daddy! I'm sorry! Reserved seats? Sixth floor. Thank you. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you all for waiting. Fireworks are by Soen Fireworks Studio, under Takumi Inoue. "Hiss! Hiss! Fantasy" will now begin! But why? I came to see the fireworks. To watch them with... the one I love the most. One more time, let's go see the Sagrada Familia together. That's not good enough. Right... Together, hand in hand. There's no difference! END
