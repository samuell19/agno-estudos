Besides, forty two thousand dollars is not enough to start a jewelry store. And it seems too soon to be starting a business. Too soon? How're you supposed to make a living? Huh? You think your life savings is gonna last you forever in this city? Don't worry about the money. I'll get the money. - I don't know. - You've been a jeweler for over twenty three years.

And I know that's the dream you have too. I can see it in your eyes. I had to do a lot of things when I first got here. That others didn't wanna do. I took risks. I worked jobs. They weren't taking me nowhere, but I knew what I wanted. Right? So let me ask you, Andre. What do you want from America? I want money. Hm. I wanna live like a king. A king... Yeah... You know how I can afford all my stuff? Shiny rocks. You have a jewelry store? No. No. I'm more of a... I'm more of a middle man. You see, what we do is we take jewelry from the wholesalers and specialty warehouses and we send them to some guys who work for me. They take the diamonds and they redesign them into these beautiful pieces. One of a kind, Andre. Works of art. And we sell the same merchandise back to whoever we took from for a better price. They report the loss to their insurance company. The insurance company covers the losses. And everybody wins. Well, everyone except for the insurance companies, but fuck them, right? We're like uh... We're like Robin Hood. You know Robin Hood. So we steal the jewels? Not exactly. We simply borrow the merchandise and sell it back to the owner for a even better price. You understand? My father's a jeweler. That right? I didn't know that. I bet you know a lot about diamonds. I could use someone like you. I want you to start working here. You'd be cleaning up tables. Bus boy.

Yes, of course. Okay. Good. Here. Buy yourself some new clothes, huh? You work for me now. You gotta look sharp. George will let you know when you start. Okay? Okay. Thank you. I'll work hard.

But I haven't received anything ever since I moved here. How did you get a job here? Cyrus gave me the job. What? Listen, I know you just got here but you can't work for him. Alex says if I work hard, I can make a lot of money. You need to stay away from Alex. He's not who you think he is. He's been helping me ever since I got here. You don't understand. My brother, Grish, he used to work for Cyrus. Grish told him he didn't want to work for him anymore but Cyrus convinced him to do one more job. Then he can walk away. They shot him in the car. Right after the job. Cyrus even paid for the funeral so no one would suspect anything, but I know he had him killed. That's what they do, Andre. Is that what you want? I didn't know. He invites me to his parties and I show up once in a while so he thinks he has me fooled. I wanted to go to the cops, but I'm too scared at what he'll do to me or my mother. Are you hungry?

If you go through with this, not only do you jeopardize your life but everyone who loves you... You're serious about this, aren't you? How selfish can you be? Sophia, I know what I'm doing. No, you don't! You're just a little boy. [sighs] I made a big mistake. I don't wanna be with you anymore. I tried to help you, but you didn't want to listen to me. I can't be around all this. - It's too dangerous. - Hey, hey. This is my last job, I promise you. You know who told me that? My brother. Look where he ended up. I am not your brother. I can handle Cyrus. I love you. I want to marry you, Sophia. I don't wanna marry you. Don't call me. Forgive your father. He's the only one you have now. Sophia! Sophia! [engine revving] [Andre] When I was a kid, they found a Russian bomb beneath the playground of our school. [shot] It had been there since World War II. For years, I had played on top of something that could blow me to bits, and escaped. The clerk from the wholesaler we hit wasn't so fortunate. Can I come in? Yes, sir. Seems we have some jewelry thieves who aren't content with simply stealing. I understand they like to murder, too. Not good. So I'm running again for Police Commissioner. What's the plan here? Well, uh, it's been tough, sir. We don't even know who they are. They leave no trace. No one's been able to ID them. I understand there's gonna be a jewelry convention coming up at the Galleria Center down at the Mission District. You think these guys are gonna try and score? Well, uh, it's been hard to say. I mean, I don't think they make a move unless they know it's a sure thing. Goddamn it, Stark. Jesus. I need a hell of a lot more confidence in your tone. Yes, sir. I want these guys put behind bars, period. Put every cop you got. Secure the Mission District. - Yes, sir. - Every cop. I want these sons of bitches behind bars... Be safe out there. Yes, sir. Cyrus, it's set. No cops will be there for twenty minutes. They are otherwise engaged. The wedding will be clear for you. [Cyrus] I knew there was a good reason to keep you around. Don't forget to transfer the money into my account by tonight. And tell your scumbags not to shoot anyone. I don't wanna waste my time reading bullshit reports all day. The white gold is doing well. I like to order the pearls, too. Yeah, their pearls are really popular. How much? Hm, that's pretty expensive. [sighs] No, no, send them. I'll have the money. Yes. You want some lunch? Okay... [sighs] You cannot be angry at me forever. As much as you want to be away from me, I won't let you go. You are your mother's pride jewel, son. I know what I did hurt you and your mother. But I cannot change the past. All I can do now is be a father to you. But you have to let me. You're my life, son. You hear me? Okay... Okay... If you need me, you know where to find me. [door closes] [chiming] [door closes] [chiming] [chuckles] You serve this to your customers? It stinks. I thought you were dead. I was resurrected. I've come here to collect what's owed to me. I don't owe you anything. No? No, no, no, you definitely owe me. How Miriam tolerated your side of the family, I'll never understand. Get out. You have no business here. You fucking donkey. Do you have any idea how lucky you are to be alive, huh? Have a little respect when you fucking talk to me. Now, I hear you owe your suppliers money. You don't know what you're talking about. - Oh no? - No. Hm, do you think every immigrant jeweler who comes here, fresh off the boat, no credit, finds a perfect place to set up shop, and a vendor to supply him? Got it? Come on, you're not that stupid. But today's your lucky day, Joseph. I paid your debt. This morning. What, no thank you? Can you believe that? [chuckles] George back there, he's gonna come by at the end of every month. To collect. My cut is sixty percent. Sixty. Get out of my store, you leech! Sixty percent. Or maybe your little boy doesn't have the money to drive a nice car, or buy nice clothes. Huh? Or maybe... maybe he'll go and see his mother. Stay away from him. You understand? Stay away from him, please. He's just a boy. He deserves a life. Your problem has been with me all your life. Not him, please. I'll walk away. You can have the store. Just stay away from him. Please... Miriam had a choice not to marry me. You know why she chose me? Because after you left her, like a coward, she finally realized that she gave her precious heart to a man without honor. I've made mistakes in my life. And I pay the price now. But you... You're a lost soul. Twenty years you have been in this country. And what do you do? The same thing. You think you're a big shot, a tough guy 'cause you have a gun and money, nice clothes. But you know what you are? You're a low-life nobody! [heavy breathing] She never loved you! Never! Take that to your grave! [tense music playing] [speaking in Russian] When I get back, the money better be ready. Understand? [sighs] Joseph? - What did you get me into? - What's going on, man? Cyrus showed up at my door today! Cyrus? Cyrus is dead. - You liar! - What are you talking about? - All this was a setup? - Setup? What are you talking about? The jewelry store! Suppliers! All lies! I spent my whole life savings! I'm left with nothing! What are you talking about, man? - Come on! - Enough! Don't lie! Why? How much he pay you?! I was trying to help you and Andre. Help? What help? What a fool I was to believe you. I came here for a new start. This is what you do to me. You're my brother. We have the same mother. I was trying to help you and Andre. Believe me. I was trying to help you and Andre. Get away from me. We are no longer family. If you come near us again ever, I will kill you. Alex! I'm the shit. Where are you? There he is. [chuckles] God, you know how much I love you. Who's the big dog? How you doing, Alex? Fucking great, man! It is my favorite time of the day. Hm, you want some? - No thanks. - Alright, suit yourself. I need to ask you for a favor. Sure. What is it? I need forty five hundred dollars. Yeah, okay. Sure. You know I promise I'll pay you back, right? I know. So, you ready for next week? I guess. I'm worried something can go wrong. Really? Like what? I don't know. It's too big of a job. Too many people. You worry too much, man. Just stick to the plan and you'll have so much money you won't even know what to do with it. Who shakes down a wedding? Cyrus, that's who! What if we tell him we don't wanna do it, you know. Tell him it's too dangerous. Wait, what? Whatever you're smoking has to be much better than what I'm taking. - I'm serious! - I'm serious, too! You see how I live my life! It's fucking shit! This man, he took me in. I'm a fucking junkie, Andre! He took me in, he taught me everything that I know! And you want me to turn my back on him just because you're scared to do a job? Wow. Fucking wow. You had no problem giving Sophia a stolen necklace, and now you're having second thoughts about doing a shakedown at a goddamn wedding? Fucking fabulous! Just change your mind! Let me tell you something, and you listen to me fucking loud and clear, you got this? You're a part of us now, and you don't bite the hand that feeds you. You got that? Hey! You understand? You're gonna do this job and you're gonna do it with a fucking smile on your face. ♪♪ [tense music playing] [people talking indistinctly] [over radio] We need more sparkling water in the tent, okay? Erin, can you get on that? Then I need someone to retap the beer and... Hey, guy, can you hear me? Loud and clear, buddy. We're in position. ♪♪ [door squeaking] Cash box is in the office. Wait for my signal. [doorbell ringing] [upbeat music playing] [cheering] [Andre] When I saw the bride, all I could think about was Sophia. That she should be the one wearing the wedding dress and I should be dancing beside her. I had made the wrong choice. But Cyrus was an island unto himself and I was stranded. I had to do this and hope the money was enough to get far, far away. One security guard in the office. One in the tent. Meet me at the service entrance and take the cash box first. I repeat, take the cash box first. Okay, it's time. [tense music playing] Andre, the cash box is here, but the guard isn't. Where the fuck is the second guard, Andre? Care to say a few words about the happy couple? Come on, don't be shy. Come on! Get that thing outta my face! Hey man, don't touch the camera. Jerk! Just put them in the fucking bag... Idiot. What are you doing? I'm hungry. Jesus, we're on a job. Relax, it's just Snickers. I'm gonna go freshen up. Looks like the bride is going inside with the bridesmaid. They went upstairs. You can get the necklace now if you move. Remember, no one gets shot. I need to use the lady's room. - I'll be right back. - Okay. [gasp] Don't scream. All the jewelry in the bag now. You have ten seconds. Go. I will not spare your life. Now you have seven seconds. Hurry. You forgot something. Come on. Listen, you have your whole life ahead of you. If love is real, he'll buy you another. Let it go... On the ground. Don't move for ten minutes. You look very lovely. Have a wonderful life. [bride screaming] Oh shit! Get down!

[heavy breathing] [sirens wailing] Come on, come on! [sirens wailing] - Drive! Drive, goddamn it! - Where's George? Hey, you're a reporter, right? Yeah, why? - Look at this. - What do you got? [reporter] A high risk jewelry heist took place at the posh Bedrossian wedding, just behind me earlier today. The family has set aside a reward worth two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, to whoever can identify one of the fugitives or identify the mastermind behind this sophisticated heist. So far, we know that this man is believed to be involved. If you have any information, you're encouraged to contact the Napa County Sheriff's Office at seven zero seven, two five... [sighing] [doorbell ringing] [sighing] Brother... Hear me out. I have an idea to help Andre. Did you get it? Yeah, everything's inside the bag. Where is everybody? I don't know. Alex and Andre were supposed to be here. Where's George? George got shot in the leg. He couldn't move. And? I killed him. You killed him? You did the right thing. Fuck! - Hello? - Alex! - Where the fuck are you? - I'm on the way. No! Shut the fuck up, you junkie! What did I tell you? - Are you high right now? - What? You said you were gonna take care of Andre. His face is all over the fucking news! - I'm not high. - No... You know what? Forget about it. Forget it. 'Cause I'm talking to a corpse. I want you to give that junkie a rush he's never had. And I want you to take care of Andre. Right? Take care of Andre. You got it, boss. No more screw-ups. [knocking] What are you doing here, son? It's okay. Come on. Follow us home. I can't go home. They'll find me there. [Andre] Uncle Davit started this and maybe he could end it. He told my father and Sophia something big. It was like handing me a gun with one bullet against an army. But all I could do was take aim and pull the trigger. Yeah, hello. Hello? Hello! Hello! Listen, you little shit, if you're playing games with me I'm gonna rip your fucking throat out when I find out who this is. You get me? [Andre] Is this Mr. Bedrossian? Who the fuck is this? I have information on Cyrus Khazarian. I know where the jewels are. Do you represent the family? Yeah, I represent them. Can we meet in person, please? Meet me at the shipyard. 4PM tomorrow. You be there. Well, give me some good news. I can't find him. You find him! You understand? You know what? Fuck it. Forget it. I'll find him myself. Sophia. Cyrus. You scared me. Why would I scare you? What are you doing here? I'm looking for Andre. Do you know where he is? I don't know. My mother doesn't allow me to see him anymore. Oh, your mother. Yeah. Your mother's very smart. He's no good, Sophia. No good. If you know where he is, I really need to talk to him. I don't know. You know, when I was younger, I knew a girl like you. She was much better than me. I never truly respected her power. For decades, I kept trying to find her, or find someone just like her. The one power I had over her was I could always tell when she was lying to me. If you know where he is, and you're trying to protect him, it's not a good idea. Sophia, I want to help him. I like Andre. So if you know where he is, please let me know. I would. You know I would. But I really don't. You watch over your mother, alright? You're lucky to have her. Oh, that's beautiful. I'll be away for a while. But I'll always know where you are... Sophia. Always. [phone ringing] I know you. Your face is all over the news. You got the money? You think I walk around with two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in my pocket. First you're gonna tell me what I wanna know. [coughing] Come on, Davit. This can all stop. Just tell me where Andre is. How do I know if I tell you what you want to know, you won't arrest me? Well, you don't. And if you lie to me, I'll be up your ass so fast you wouldn't know what to do. And there's a catch. What's the catch? Well, I arrange the money. I get ninety percent off the top. No way. I'm taking all the risks! I don't even know if you'll let me go! Come on. You know. Look at me. You know. Just tell me where he is. I'll stop all this right now. The way I see it, you only got one option. I could shoot you dead right here right now. Nobody would give a rat's ass. But you know something? Maybe you're right. You take your chances. I'm sure you'll be fine. Wait! I'll tell you, but I walk away from this whole thing, right? [groaning] [coughing] Ahh, I guess you're not as weak as I thought you were. But now you're being fucking stupid. Look at me. You're being stupid, Davit. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where is he?! Are you gonna talk or what? Cyrus sends the jewels to a couple guys at the Glenoaks Apartments in Helendale. Helendale? San Bernardino? Look, I said I don't know. Okay, Davit. [Alexander] You'll pick up the cash at a small park down at the Marina. There'll be a surfboard have no business on top of a green statue. Underneath the surfboard, you'll find a grocery bag with your money in it. Just make sure you keep your nose clean in this town. 'Cause if you don't, I'll put you away in a heartbeat. Where's Andre?! Fuck you! Elmer! Come on, Viola! Follow me. Come here. Come here. One for you. Wow! Nice of you to join us. - Ahh, my pleasure. - Let's do this. Let me do the honors. This fucking guy, huh? Oh, it's good. It's good. Yeah... Don't fuckin' move! Let me see your hands, asshole! Stand up. Behind your back. Turn around. Put 'em behind your back slowly. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you can't afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Do you understand your rights? Fuck your rights. Let me talk to him... alone. You two wait outside... This is what happens when you threaten my family. You're nothing but a fucking low-life. You better hope I don't get out. That won't be a problem. Stark! Sanchez! Sir, there's a reporter outside. Already. Hm, I'll talk to 'em. [Alexander] I'm happy to say today that our dedicated detectives arrested Cyrus Khazaryan, mastermind behind a 1.6 million dollar jewelry heist that took place at Emma Bedrossian's wedding. This arrest wouldn't have been possible without Mr Bedrossian's assistance and generosity. There are still three fugitives at large but rest assured we have got credible leads and we're following these leads aggressively. I do have a message for the fugitives. If you think you're getting away, you're making a big mistake. We are coming for you. We will find you. And we will arrest you. So make it easy on yourselves. Where you going? Hey, I was just coming to your place. Really? Why? To see if you were doing okay. Why wouldn't I be doing okay? And why are you lying to me? I'm not lying to you! So where have you been? I've been laying low. See? You lied to me again. And I fucking hate liars. - After all we did! - Oh wait, wait. [gasping] [Andre] So once upon a time, a man travels across the sea with his father in search of a better life, and spins the wheel of fortune. He meets some bad people and does some bad things. Until one day, he meets a woman and falls in love. She takes his hand and leads him away, and they have a child. He works twelve hours a day. And for the first time he feels rich. I don't live like a king and I still don't make much money, but I finally understand that word: fortune. [Eddy] Hey stranger! Forgot your wallet. Don't lose your ID. People can find out where you live... You have a beautiful wife. Who was that? Nobody. Come on, your father's waiting for us... ah, did you get my mom's pills? I did. Don't worry.
