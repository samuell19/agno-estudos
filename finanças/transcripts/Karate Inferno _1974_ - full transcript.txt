TETSURO TAMBA RYO IKEBE DIRECTOR: TERUO ISHII We have an emergency. Gather the three of them. Uncle, do you think they'll cooperate? That's your job to make them, Emi. This is where they are currently. "Ryuichi Koga, 24th generation heir to the Koga Ninja School. "Since destroying Mario Mizuhara, "the Japanese made man of the New York Mafia, "he has joined the Rangers Unit of the Self Defence Forces." Hey, the Commander is calling! RANGER BATTALION COMMANDER MOTOHASHI - Koga. - Yes. Recite the rules of paratrooper training. Yes. One: During training, even to family and relatives, subject, location, date and time are absolutely confidential. - Two… - Wait! You have already violated Rule One. Commander, I don't recall. Don't lie to me! If you'd followed the rules, a visitor wouldn't know you were here! I have a visitor? It must be a big job. If this paltry amount of money gets you excited, your reputation as a Koga man will suffer. I'll turn down the job, but take the money. You owe me ten times more. Thanks for your efforts in carrying that wastepaper. Wastepaper? If they weren't so cut up, you could take them to the bank. - You're playing dirty. - That's life. If you turn us down, we'll reveal details about your past. Damn you… That old man raccoon! Takeshi Hayabusa. Former police Narcotics Squad section chief. Since destroying the mafioso Mario Mizuhara, he once again returns to the underworld as a lone wolf assassin. Commissioner, Emi delivered this to me. - However, I must return it. - Oh? You don't need the money? You're not being straight with me, Commissioner. - I thought we were above money. - Don't get angry. Please accept it as a gesture of good faith. But it's short by a third. I can't use it. No. But you'll be able to use it soon. Koga should be showing up soon. I have to work with him again? The last time, he was clinging to the ceiling and overheard everything. Yes, a man possessing prodigious physical development. More like a form of retardation. I like that kind of guy. Handsome with a good disposition. In other words, not good enough! No, that's not true. He acts like a crook, but he's honourable and disciplined. I don't know what you want, but I can do the job without that tough guy. This job is too big for that. It's in the hundreds of millions. The Commissioner says split the money as you see fit. A million should be more than enough for that punk. He'll be so happy, he'll lose his mind. Surprise! Come on! Hey, long time no see! Handsome as usual. Very cool! Right, Uncle? You skunk! You call me a volunteer? What are you getting all excited about? You've got it all wrong. I was talking bad about Koga. Koga? That's me. You're Koga… I'd mistaken that conceited fool for Koga! Cheer up. So, what's the job? Huh? I'll tell you when everyone is present. We need one more person. - But Sakura won't come. - What? That idiot won't come even for hundreds of millions? It's a high-risk job? Sakura won't come because of a woman. He's very popular. - He's popular with women? - That's right. He's so smug, he said it was better than money. He has an attraction that men don't understand. To think, he used to hit on me. I resent it. - I hear his face is in vogue. - With very current sensibilities. Knock it off, you half-wit! That moron is two, three, four degrees below me. I can convince women in the wink of an eye. Then, will you do that? Sure, leave it to me. HANAKO NAKAJO, ICHIRO SAKURA Ichiro Sakura, Japanese Aikido Dojo Instructor. Since destroying Mario Mizuhara and his cohorts, he was imprisoned for rape and safe-cracking but escaped. Hey! It's me! What's with all the noise? No one's home! Stop kidding around. I saw his face. Hey, you! Are you threatening me? - I said he's not here. - How the hell would you know? - Tell his wife! - I am his wife. You're the wife? Oh… I got it. Yeah, he's in vogue with this monster. I see. You're the one he's been talking about. "I'm in prison for rape, but she fell in love with me, so I'm appealing my term. "After doing my time, I'll hook up with her." You're the one he was talking about. Damn him… It's that other woman! Look at this. You dropped me from heaven to hell! I'm going to settle this. - I thought you'd thank me. - What? I freed you from that gold-toothed monster. - Bastard! I can't stand you! - Wait. You got it good. Kicked out without a word. No! You left her. It was out of friendship, and now he hates me. Yeah, I'm in the same position. Killing two birds with one stone. Fancy words, brother! "Killing two birds with one stone." Mighty fancy words. Worth a Nobel Prize! You're bursting with cultural refinement! Well, you know, I've looked into a little literature. For example, Nifu Nagai, Fujimura Shimazaki… I've breezed through all that stuff. Hey, brother, you dropped some money. - Is that your 10,000 yen note? - 10,000 yen? - It's only 500 yen. - 500 yen? - That's mine. Thanks. - You dirty… The snacks are ready. The snacks are ready! - That guy's dirty. - Basically, he's conceited. She calls these snacks? They're old. Brother, grab the salt. Right. - Let's make a toast! - Let's toast. Cheers! Let's all get along! Sounds like fun. Uncle's on his way, but he wants you to see this video first. Finally, the subject in question! The Honorary Chairman of the International Philanthropic Organisation, Mrs. Sabine Kaufman is visiting Japan with her daughter Julie. Having lost her husband in a car accident as well as herself being paraplegic, on behalf of the handicapped people of Japan, Mrs. Sabine Kaufman will exhibit the Kaufman family jewellery and donate all the proceeds to charity. - Around her neck she is wearing… - So cool! - …the world famous Star of the Pharaoh. - That's one hot chick. It's the jewellery I'm talking about. Neither has anything to do with us. But it has a lot to do with you. Commissioner… I heard it's about hundreds of millions. What's this got to do with us? Oh? Can't you tell? You've been so busy with your women, maybe you can't think straight. So, we're after this jewellery? You guys can do it. I don't want to rip off a philanthropic organisation. You sound so righteous. Have the Armed Forces shaped you up? - Are you picking a fight? - Whoa, hang on. Commissioner… let's hear about the job. The objective is to obtain the Star of the Pharaoh, worth one billion yen. The exhibition should have opened, but it's already delayed by three days. The reason for that is… Commissioner, excuse me. Chairman, it's time for your medication. Mr. Arajiyama… Lady Sabine has informed me that The Star of the Pharaoh has been stolen. And what do the police say? We haven't told the police yet. Why is that? You should, as soon as possible. But when I think of my position as chairman of an insurance company, one billion in damages is going to hurt. But when I think of Lady Sabine… I received a threatening phone call. They have kidnapped Julie along with the jewellery. - Kidnapped the daughter? - A five-year-old girl. They threatened to kill the child if she contacts the police. The Japanese police are excellent. They'll get your daughter and jewellery back without fail. Julie! If the police fail, the child will be killed. Will you take responsibility? You, according to the contract, have the responsibility to pay one billion yen. That's the story. It's no big deal. Going by the contract, the insurance company simply has to pay one billion. How do you say we profit from this? The Chairman is worried about the life of the child. He promised Lady Sabine that the police will not be notified. Letting go of one billion yen will hurt his company. He's relying on our past relationship, and has asked me to get back the child and the jewellery. - He begged me. - Okay, I'm in! What do we do? Lady Sabine's secretary, a man called Bruno Imamura, will deliver the cash to the criminals. The cash will be handed over in exchange for the child and jewellery. After that happens, you will do your thing. Right, I understand. - When's the handover? - Sunday. In front of the Parliament Building. 1:30pm. In front of the Parliament Building? You're Bruno? I was asked to hand this to you. ROOFTOP OF GINZA NEW-HARK. 2:00PM SHARP. COME ON FOOT. Paging Mr. Imamura. Paging Mr. Imamura. Your child is waiting. Please come to the rooftop corner. Well, now, well, now. Oh, Julie! - Well, now. - Oh, Julie. Oh, Julie. Julie! Oh, Julie! Oh, Julie! Move. What do you mean, move? You're very rude. - What's the problem? - This man has it in for me. Shall I call the police? What's going on? I see. You're all in on it. NEW YEAR BARGAINS What? - What? What are you doing? - You got really big tits. You pervert! Koga! - Huh? Huh? - What's that idiot doing? Let go of your hand! Good, that's it. Go for it. No way! Start! Oh, no! - Watch out! - Move! Move! Move! Move! Koga! Koga! Hang in there, Koga! Don't fall in the water, you idiot! Get it back. Pretty lousy job done by you guys. What did you say? We got the kid back safe, didn't we? Not a scratch on her. Not exactly "got back", more like fortunately left behind. What are you saying? We risked our lives. What's this girl sitting here for, anyway? Now, now. Don't get so excited. Allow me to introduce her. This is my secretary, Miko Kurenai. What she just said is actually a comment from Lady Sabine. You couldn't get the jewellery because you used buffoons and made the crooks angry. If the jewellery isn't returned, we require the one billion in insurance. I see. She's a real businesswoman. Unforgivable on an emotional level, but she does have a point. If you three hadn't shown up, they may have kept their promise and returned both the child and the jewellery. Hey, you're talking as if we were in with them. The Chairman is only speaking on behalf of Lady Sabine. What do you mean, "on behalf"? Go home, take a crap, and go to sleep, you lousy chick. So, what's the conclusion? We worked for free? Chairman? - That's life. - It's a tough world out there. You guys make me sick! Chairman, you're not going to listen to Sabine, and just pay out that one billion, right? I want to only pay half. But there's been pressure on the Foreign Ministry from their embassy. An insurance company can't take on the Foreign Ministry. What's the conclusion? One billion yen has been paid by the Chairman. So, the Chairman's company lost a total of two billion. If we can get back the Star of the Pharaoh and return it to the Chairman… …Lady Sabine will return one billion to your company? In fact, an hour ago, Lady Sabine made a deal with the thieves. What's that about? She exchanged one billion yen for the jewellery. Why didn't you hurry up and say so? Making a fool of me… Let's be rational about this. Will we get paid? - Not a hope. - We gave over the cash. The deal was made late, so there's no place to put the jewellery. As for Lady Sabine… …she's hired security but apparently it's chaotic. A man has to accept the situation. It's like we just had a bad dream. I'll never see you people again. Well, then… Damn it. Working for free… Don't soil those valuable clothes that Uncle has lent you. - Hey, offer him some tissue. - Okay. Excuse me. The woman I love… I don't know where she is. You had a dream. Just a bad dream. Time for your feed. What a lech! That's a pretty fancy manoeuvre. What? After you come off so sober and honest! - Risky. - Idiot! I gave her sleeping pills. Moron, you should've said so sooner. My balls shrivelled up. - The sleeping pills better be working. - Hey… Your security guard disguise is a pretty good idea. - Incidentally, regarding the goods… - Don't be so impatient. We'll split it fifty-fifty. So, the Commissioner has gone to a hot spring resort… How long are you going to sleep, you idiot? Wake up. Wake up! - Get up, already! - Don't ever touch me like that. Have you got ringworm? If you warm it up, it'll get incredibly itchy. Shh! Go away. Why are you looking at my private parts? Idiot! Who would look at such a filthy thing? He says this jewellery worth one billion is filthy. What a fool! Mr. Hayabusa's waiting. Tell him not to worry, I won't take off alone. - Is that how you speak to a lady? - Oh, yeah, "lady"? Worship this treasure. You'll get down and dirty. Disgusting! Let's forget about him and eat. - Emi, what happened? - Nothing. If something's bothering you, you can talk to me. You're such a gentleman. Koga's the worst, in comparison. Emi, you really understand the nuances. You've really grown up. Oh, it's burning! Let me take care of it. It's fine. You don't want to dirty your pretty hands. Flirting first thing in the morning? - You're really good. - Not at all. - Oh, no! I blew it. - I told you I'd do it for you. Sorry, brother. I didn't do it on purpose. Sorry… Bastard… Hey, morning, all. What kind of get-up is that? It's rude to the lady. Who do you think you are? Ouch, ouch, ouch. Hey, are you alright? You're tired from last night. Sit down. Emi, don't worry, I'll take care of it. Here's an interesting article. VALUED AT ONE BILLION YEN, THE ETERNAL SPARKLE No way they can do it. But I just saw a big splash on the TV news. - There were 50,000 spectators. - What's that supposed to mean? - Last night's jewellery was an imitation. - Imitation? You don't know what "illumination" means? You're pretty stupid. It means it's fake. Overseas, they normally use copies just in case. It's just common sense. Without knowing it was an "illumination", there was this stupid guy who risked his life climbing the side of a building. It's a good gag, isn't it, Emi? That tickles. Your bad side has reawakened, hasn't it? I'll have to cut off your wandering hands. But it's hard to believe you can use that glue on a glass surface. But this brother often talks nonsense. Not just glass, it'll stick to anything. Try it. It's real sticky, isn't it? Something's wrong. It won't come off. - Won't come off? - Won't come off. That's not possible. Let's see. Whoa! Sorry, sorry, sorry. - It won't come off! - It works on human skin, too? It says, "Caution: dangerous. Keep away from skin." - What? - Poor guy. You can't rub a pretty girl's bottom if you're stuck here! - You've got to be kidding me. - I just realised something. It's strange that Lady Sabine reported a theft when it was an imitation. I was wondering when you'd catch on! This is no joke! What are you going to do? Shut up! This is an important conversation! - Damn you! - Let me shut that mouth for you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Enough already. - Stop… Let's check out the scene and figure it out. - The scene? - Follow me and you'll see. Right. Hey, hey. Wait for me. I want to go to the toilet. This is for crapping. And you can pee in that. Do something. There's nothing I can do. It sure is effective. It's a big one. Please, make yourself scarce. How do I do this? According to the TV news, the Star of the Pharaoh is kept at Rogers Bank. This is the building. I've never heard of this bank. It's one of the top ten overseas banks. They have a custom vault, famous for storing jewellery. It's not strange that Lady Sabine would deposit her jewellery there. But when I delved a bit deeper, I found that Rico the General Manager of Rogers Bank is suspect. Wherever he goes, a crime like this seems to occur. And the insurance money always goes into Rogers Bank. I see. I get the picture now. The Commissioner suspects that the Chicago mafia is infiltrating Japan. Is Lady Sabine in on this? I went in to steal the imitation to test that theory. Idiot. You should've told me that right away. I'm having cold sweats over this. If she'd kicked up a fuss, then innocent. Otherwise, guilty. So, Lady Sabine is part of the Chicago Mafia. That's life. Rico's a good-looking guy. I'll introduce you to him. - Introduce us? - Remember his face. He goes out for lunch at 12:00 sharp. Here he comes. That's him. If you're right, they insured the jewellery for one billion, then lied that it was stolen. And one billion on top of that for the kid. A total of two billion in profit. Real bad guys. And so, I plan to steal the cash and jewellery from their vault. - You want in? - Do you even have to ask? This is how we'll split the work. This building is twenty storeys. The vault is on the nineteenth floor. The eighteenth floor has 24-hour top-notch security. If the lower floor's no good, I'll come in from above. Sounds good. How would you do it? Well, let's see. A Cessna and parachute. That fits perfectly with my plan. We fly a Cessna at night. Descend onto the rooftop by parachute. Will the parachute land on the rooftop so smoothly? Only Ryuichi Koga of the Ranger Battalion can do that! I can jump from 200 metres with 0.5-metre accuracy. Right… Let's say you land in one piece on the rooftop. To get to the 19th floor vault, you go through the 20th floor conference room. Rather than that, why don't you use the glue and enter through the windows? But, you see… …the 19th floor, where the vault is, doesn't have any windows. That's right. Just remember that. I didn't realise that. Emi… The problem is, the security cameras are installed here. If we don't deal with them, everything will show up to the security in the 19th-floor monitor room. When I go through the conference room, a power outage would be convenient. Leave that to me. - Are you alright with that, Emi? - Hey, very intricate! Uncle put a lot of work into this model. It should take ten seconds for a man to get through the conference room. Don't talk rubbish! Five seconds for me. Hey, moron, can you do it? Why are you praying? We need an electrician for the five-second power outage. I've got that covered. Okay, I got it. We run through the halls. Then what? The hallway that leads to the 19th floor vault… …is half covered by an infrared security system. Step in it and the 18th floor security detail comes rushing in? When the alarm is tripped, they'll anticipate further intrusion, so there's a 2000-volt electrical barrier. - And you're toast! - It'll look like this. If you turn into toast, then you'll be… - Just what are you saying? - Shut up! There'll be no fighting during this mission. We were talking about the infrared security and high-voltage barrier, right? You've got that figured. Just move along the ceiling. With that glue of yours. And, now, we come to the vault. Once the low-intelligence, physical labour gets out of the way, Master Ichiro Sakura enters the picture. Unlike typical vaults, it can't be opened by instinct. I've opened first-class West German safes with no problem. But the vault at Rogers Bank is custom-made. Custom-made? Even the best safe-crackers haven't cracked a custom-made vault. - What are you going to do? - Is there no hope? If I had just one hint… I could open it. Right, leave that to me. Brother, it's on you. The only two who can open this safe are the general manager, Rico, and Morris, the accountant. Let's assume the safe is opened. Let's move on. Okay. The safe opens. We take the jewellery and as much cash as we can carry. We head back up to the rooftop. We attach an umbrella to the package and drop it to the road below. I will be in a car below… …and take it from here. Wait. I want to verify something first. I understand the part from the rooftop, but how do I get up to the rooftop? You idiot! Not get up, but come down. - Emi, do that thing again. - Okay. That's strange. Where did it go? It's not here. What happened to it? Ouch! Ouch! Are you alright, you idiot? Don't move. That's awful. Damn you… Oh… here it is. Hey, understand this, you idiot, you will cling on to me and drop down from the sky. This cool guy is me, this ugly guy is you. We descend all the way like this… - Sorry, but I'm off this job. Goodbye. - Why? Two on a parachute? I don't care how many lives I have! Idiot! You're thinking like an amateur. There's turbulence between buildings. It's worse for one person parachuting. Listen, in other words… Oh, I do apologise. In other words, with a combined weight, we'll be on target and won't drift… - Watch out! - What are you up to? You think you can treat me like some toy? Hey, you're only seeing the negative side. If you're off this job, you can't eat with a hand like this. And, brother, even that monster of a wife will refuse to deal with you. Mr. Sakura, when this job is over, you can live like a king in Miami Beach, and I can be your queen. We can live a luxurious life. Emi as queen. Me as king. Perfect. We hid a mic in his clothing. This bloody thing… It's comical, watching an idiot trying to look smart. Sakura, what's happening? I got 99 percent of it. Really? That's wonderful. Are you kidding? A moron like you can't understand my genius. Genius? A hair's breadth from a crackpot. - You deserve the Nobel Prize. - Wow. You're a genius. - Well… - I'd like to see your mother's face. - Your mother must be really clever. - Was she at Seishin Women's College? Oh, don't make me weep! Hey, Tatsuzo! Long time no see. You're looking well. You really helped me out, sir. Thanks to you, I haven't had to eat prison food. I burn incense and pray for you every day, sir. Hey, that's bad luck. I'm still full of life! Sorry, sorry. If you think you owe me, I need a favour. Sir, please wait a moment. The Chief Investigator's likely skint. He probably came to hit me up. I don't have any money, though. Oh, man, I went and did it! He brings bad luck from the get-go! Sir, you seem to be on hard times. This is all I have. Please accept it in good faith. You don't have to worry about the favour I want. Just twice, that's all, I need a power outage. There won't be any problems for you. How about it? Anything for you, sir! I haven't forgotten your generosity. - I'll give you the details later. - Yes, sir! - Half up front. Keep it. - Yes, sir! I'll be waiting! Lucky from the get-go. It really is "half" up front. - Is anybody here? - Yes! Yes! Oh, my glasses! Yes, sir, I've been expecting you. Here. I have bad eyes. Excuse my near-sightedness. I thought you were over here, sir. The Commander has arrived for a surprise inspection. Your effort is appreciated, sir! This way, sir. On these shelves are the parachutes. All prepared and ready. What is it? It's filthy! Shape up! I apologise, sir. I will strive to supply a military that everyone will be proud of, sir! We want to see the latest infrared viewer. What? Oh, this way, please. Please, please, please. This is it, sir. You can see couples having sex at night. They're highly effective! - Imbecile! - Excuse me, I got excited. We also want to see where the gas masks are kept. Did you say gas masks, sir? - Yes. - Yes, sir. Let's go straight to the masks. Your efforts are greatly appreciated, sir. Officers approaching. Are you alright, sir? You feel alright? I haven't been sleeping much recently. You should rest awhile over there. Be careful, sir. I'm sorry about the bad weather, sir! Big brother? What do you mean, "big brother"? Don't mix personal business with work. I'm embarrassed in front of you. - Idiot! - Idiot? You don't have to call me an idiot, brother. Just because we have different fathers. Aren't we brothers that came out of the same woman? Little brother, little brother… Big brother! Hey, never mind that. Who were those three just now? Them? They were inspectors, in advance of you. Imbecile! I'm the only inspector. They're imposters! Emergency dragnet! - Hurry up. - We're in trouble. Oh, no. Over here. - Get in here. Hurry. - Hurry it up! - Knock it off. Knock it off, I said! - Just bear with it! I can't. I won't. Okay. Search everywhere! - Hey! Cover gate three! - Yes, sir! - Listen, jump this way. - Right. Okay. - This is bad! - Are you alright? That idiot, how long is he gonna stay in that crappy sewer? - Everything is going according to plan. - Preparations are all in place. Let's celebrate. Let's have a toast. Wait a second. In such a first-class establishment, we have to mind our manners. Manners? You stink! What's that? This is why I can't bring you to a fancy place. It's normal. It's normal. Okay. Cheers! - What are they doing? - Looks like they're from the Vatican! There's a lot of them about these days. - Look what that guy's doing. - He's drinking it. Idiot! I said, mind your manners. What should I do? By the way, is the aeroplane ready? Yeah. Excuse me. - Your napkin, sir. - Napkin? - Yes. - Oh. You want to eat napkins? - Yeah. - And you? - Yeah. - We'll have four. Yes. I'm a little confused, sir… Excuse me, sir. They're for your lap. Yeah, right. "Napkins," he says. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me! It's alright. Never mind. Don't screw it up. - He's late. - Where the hell is he? The engine cries That's the sound Hayabusa flies Well beyond the clouds Cool! What a weird voice. What? You guys are slacking! What's that get-up? You can't talk! You're dressed rather behind the times. - Where's the pilot? - Stop complaining. - I was planning to pilot the Cessna. - What? You? Why are you pulling a face like that? They don't call me "Hawk" Hayabusa for nothing! This sword was known as the Blossom of War, and it belonged to the famous Kato-Hayabusa Fighter Squadron! - I have a bad feeling about this. - What did you say? I hope your skills aren't as rusty as this. Here. The Hayabusa Fighter Squadron is impressive. Oh, yes, yes. It's only human to err. Right. This is good. - What's the matter? Malfunction? - Don't rush me! Once we're flying, it's only two minutes to the site. Hang on… "The Army-Air Force Elementary Flying Manual". You were a rookie? Yeah. It's been thirty years. Hey, hey, hey… - Where do you think you're going? - I have to pee. I'm going, too. We'll go together. - Oh, no! - It's moving. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no! Get off of me! Oh, no! Increase the altitude. We're gonna crash! - That's what I was just thinking. - Hurry! It's not that easy! Where are you heading? - Where are you heading? - Shut up! I'm looking it up. There's no time to read an elementary manual! Koga… don't just sit there. Do something! How much flying time did you log? I flew two or three times, and then the war ended. - Two or three times? - I don't want to die! Let me out! Hey! Where are you going? It's a tunnel! - Good. It's all coming back to me! - We're counting on it. It's time to get ready, you idiot! I'm sorry, I want out! What are you talking about? Even if you wanted to get out, I got the lowest grades in landing. Stop sticking your arse out! Get your head up! You guys, I've done nothing wrong! - This is no joke! - Right, we're right on target. We're jumping to the target. Here we go! Hanako! Oh, no! 2:00 — CONFERENCE ROOM POWER OUTAGE FIVE SECONDS. Okay, take it up. There's no way I can land this. This is unbearable! Ten chips for now. - I'm scared. - What are you trembling about? Right, it's time. Let's go. Three seconds, two seconds, one second. Hey! What is it? It was a power outage. My call. 2:10 — INFRARED SECURITY AREA PENETRATION. Okay. Let's go. No time to waste. Hey, get a move on! What are you groaning about? Are you constipated? You're on top of me… Forward, you idiot! Here. Turn. Turn around. Turn right! Be careful now. Custom-made vault… Man, this is a dirty job. This is killing me! Stop complaining. Just do it! You're like an old man, grumbling and mumbling stuff I can't understand! - Be clear with your instructions! - You fool. Is this clear enough for you? That's your answer? - Smell the gas and wake up! - You think I'm some kind of balloon? You're making a fool of me! Hey! From here onwards, it's the laser beam section. Screw up here and your arse will be fried! Understand? I understand. - You got an idea of the height? - Yeah, I got it. Sakura! Sakura, hurry, hurry! 2:21 — INITIATE VAULT PENETRATION Hey, no time to catch your breath! Hurry. Hurry! We've not much time! 2:30 — COMPLETE VAULT PENETRATION - Whoa! Help me! - Idiot! Hurry, if you value your life. It's hot! Hot! Hot! Hot! It's hot! It's really hot. Brother… Ouch! It's hot. Help me! Brother! Help me! - It's hot. - Persevere, you idiot! Come on. We have a lot of money. If things go well, you'll be King of Miami! Keep your arse up. Two more, one more… Good!
