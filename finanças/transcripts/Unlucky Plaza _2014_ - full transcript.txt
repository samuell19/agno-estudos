My name is Onassis Hernandez. I am a Singapore Permanent Resident. I am I am… I am in this house, 97 Stevens Road, which is not my house. This is the house of my landlady, Michelle Chan, and her husband Terence Chia. I will try to explain why I’m here and why I’m doing this. But first, I have a message for the police. These people, they are the real bad guys. They forced me to do this. I just… I am not doing this for the money. I’m not asking for money. I just want to leave this country safely with my son. So this is all I ask. I’ve been living in Singapore for twelve years now. The first two, three years… it was like... It was to escape. Escape Manila. To get fresh air in a brand new place. But then I married… I married a local here. Look, my whole belief system, after I said goodbye to television, just changed. My whole attitude towards life just changed completely. How so? Well… First of all, I came to the conclusion that this whole idea of being an ‘artiste’ was essentially rubbish. After a whole decade of doing all these mediocre TV shows, I guess I saw the light. But somewhere along the way things seemed to have gone horribly wrong for you. The food poisoning scandal. Everyone knows that the-- The food poisoning scandal in your restaurant. Everyone knows that the food poisoning was not due to negligence on my part. I was sabotaged. It was… Of course there’s a part of me that wishes… that just wishes it was all a bad dream. But that’s just stupid. You cannot wish things away. All those awful things did happen. Good evening. In tonight’s programme, we speak to three survivors of a bizarre hostage situation that took place in Singapore over a year ago. How did one man’s financial woes spiral into a harrowing crisis that captivated the world? I’m Anita Kapoor and this is The Late Interview. Onassis. Open the door. Onassis, I know you’re inside. Don’t think you can hide forever! You don’t reply to my SMS. You don’t answer my calls. How long do you think you can avoid me? I was not avoiding you. What other excuses do you have now? No excuses. Have you considered my-- Your what? Consider your what? I was asking for three more months. I already gave you three months. But business is really bad. Business is bad, business is bad. Your business has been bad for how many months already? How many times must I tell you the current market rate is already twenty per cent higher-- I know what the current market rate is, okay! Sorry. Mrs Heng… How long have I been your tenant? - No… - Ten years? Please… Mrs Heng, can you make an exception… I’ve already done that for three months. - Two months? - No. - One? - No. You cannot just-- I cannot what? I cannot just what, Mr Onassis! You should be happy I haven’t kicked you out! What other excuses do you have now? You think I don't have bills to pay! You think my diabetes medicine is free! Isn’t that… subsidized? Suck my father’s cock, all right! Can you stop licking like a dog and be a man! Suck your mother’s pubes, okay! If you can’t pay the new rate in one week I will kick you out! Stop! Please… Stop! We’ll talk later. Thanks. Are we going to be homeless? Of course not. She’s just being melodramatic. You know how she is. What is ‘cheebye moh’? Something you will never have. Anyway, I was just bluffing to see if we can get our old rate back for a few more months. What’s the new rate? Don't even think about it. Maybe we should call my mother. Why did you say that, huh? Why did you suddenly say that? Maybe she can help us get money. How? Her rich boyfriend. Who said he’s rich. You did! You’re always calling him a rich douchebag lawyer. Did you see her? Did she come to school looking for you? No. It’s okay, you can tell me. No, but we can still call her, right? No. Why? No. Why? No! We’re not desperate. Yeah, right. Oi! I’m not stupid, Tatay. We don’t have Fruit Loops for breakfast anymore and I hate kaya bread! How can you hate kaya bread? Who hates kaya bread? Tatay! Anak! Popoy, I’m sorry. But we are not that desperate. I know you’re not stupid so let’s talk man to man. Listen to me. We are going to be fine. Liar. May I reach into my pocket? Don't shoot. Fruit Loops. You didn’t wash your hands. You’re not eating the box! Hi. - Pastor Tong. - Michelle. I’m so sorry… I shouldn’t have bothered you. No, really it’s fine. You must be so busy. I’m never busy. I’m the worst property agent in the world. I’m so sorry. I… Please, sit down. Really, it’s fine. Actually, can I just have a black coffee. Sure. Thank you. So… talk to me. You sounded very upset on the phone. Oh, no… I’m okay... I’m sorry, it’s just that… It’s just that I had…like a... You know when everything suddenly… Hey, hey... No, really, please… it’s okay. I’m glad you called. I’m always glad when my flock calls. It means you’re not bottling things up. That’s good. I know you’ve been through a lot. Just take a breath and talk to me. I know it’s been hard. Why? You always say ‘my flock’. But you are my flock. I’m pastor, you’re… you’re my flock. It’s nice seeing you in work clothes... Very trendy. You want to tell me what’s wrong? I mean... it’s the same thing you’ve heard it all before. I’m… I’m frustrated… I’m trapped… I feel like such a broken record. But… what happened before you called me? You said you were at the library. Well, I was at the library forcing myself to mark a few papers. An old student came up to me. Well, he said he was an old student. Noel Ong. But I… I couldn’t recognize him at all. I had no idea who he was. So I did the thing, you know… “How are you?” “What are you doing?” Blah blah blah… He said he writes music. He’s a guitarist in a rock band and they play every night at some bar. So I said, “Wow, Noel, bold career choice!” And then you know what? When I said that, he just looked…stunned. And then he said, “What do you mean, Miss Chan? You were the one who said we must have the guts to pursue our dreams. It was because of you that I became a musician.” Can you imagine that? I used to inspire my students. Now I can’t even remember the good ones. Hey... it’s okay. I mean, who the fuck is Noel Ong! Hey, hey... I hate myself. Listen... Listen... You’ve been under a lot of pressure at home. It’s been, what, five months since you lost the baby? You’ve had a lot to deal with, way too much. Lord knows anyone in your shoes is entitled to a meltdown. Just take a breath. Would you like to pray? It’s okay if you don't want to. We can talk about… Thank you. Now, You’ve all probably heard by now and if you haven’t then you’re too slow and you don't belong in this business. Sentosa Cove, sold for thirty million dollars. That’s right. Thirty big ones. Sold to a couple from Indonesia. How did I do it? How did I… reel them in? That’s what you want to know, right? That’s what you all want to know, right? Well, I could tell you. Yeah, I could tell you but then I might have to kill you. Well then before I kill you, let’s just have a little chat. So, first things first. What is the First Law of the Wealth Paradigm? Come on, I know you all know it. What is the First Law? The Money Blueprint is everything. That’s right. The Money Blueprint is everything. The Money Blueprint is everything. And what is the Money Blueprint? Software. That’s right, software. Software that is already embedded in your subconscious mind. And it’s this software, ladies and gentlemen, beyond anything and everything else combined that will ultimately decide whether you succeed or you fail. Whether you win or you lose. Because, let me tell you. You can know everything about marketing, everything about choosing the best leads, about closing. You can own a big fuck off company. You can have the best stock in the whole world. But… without your Money Blueprint preset for the highest level of success you will never, I repeat, you will never make a fuckload of money. Let’s face it. That’s what we’re all here to do, right? Am I right? And you know what? If by some pure dumb luck you manage to cheat the gods and make a killing but you don’t have your Money Blueprint sorted I’m sorry I have some bad news for you: You’re going to lose it all. That’s right. But… There is some good news. Yes, I have some good news for you. And I’m going to share it with you because that’s the kind of guy I am. That’s the kind of guy I am! And what is the good news? The good news is there is a solution. There is a solution. And the solution is The Wealth Paradigm. That’s right. So if you are willing to listen, if you are willing to learn, I can help you reset your Money Blueprint and help you create natural automatic and permanent success. Smell it? Can you smell it already? Can you smell it? That’s right. We, together, can change our Money Blueprint. Right here. Right now. Today. It’s guaranteed! - Are we going to do it! - Yes! Yes, yes, yes… Sky! Sky! Sky… Michelle… I’m gonna come… No, wait… You cannot come inside me. Then, how? Wait, wait, wait! Oi, Ping! Very free, is it? There are no customers. No customers, no customers. But there is nobody. I know there is nobody. But if there is no customers, you have to invite people in so there will be customers. Why don't you give out flyers, huh, with a smile on your face? They say Chinese people are hardworking. Maybe you should open your eyes wider to see that there is work to be done. My eyes are open. Why do you always treat me like shit? Bloody hell… Because you are shit. You look like shit, you smell like shit. Your kind, you even eat shit. If you don’t like Chinese people, why don't you hire Filipinos? If Filipino people don’t eat shit, why don’t you hire Filipinos? Maybe I will. If you continue being like this, maybe I will hire Filipinos. Then you can go fuck off back to your Ching Chong Chai province wherever the fuck that is. I quit. Quit! Go! Quit! Come on over! Tasty Filipino food… Porko’s… What? But Mr Lim, I applied one year ago… Hernandez. Onassis Hernandez. No… not PR. I’m already a PR. Pink IC. I understand there is no fixed timeline. But just generally tell me how long… Six months? Eighteen months? Hello? Hello? Tito Porko. I will not go down. Haz… Where’s Lee? He quit, boss. You didn’t pay him. Fucking hell. But it’s true, boss. Move, move. What’s that? Boss? This is Ah Tiong. You know, when Tito Porko first move to Singapore and opened his foodcart, he bought this cleaver from a shop in… Chinatown. He called it ‘his first local assistant’, Ah Tiong. Ten years later, he upgraded to a hawker stall and still he was using Ah Tiong. Twelve years later, he opened this restaurant, and guess what? He sold his hawker stall? Still using Ah Tiong, stupid! And still as sharp as ever. Corn. Later, when Uncle Porko decided to retire, he handed his business to his son J.T. And he said, ‘If Porko is retiring, Ah Tiong is retiring.’ Chicken. Then why is it here with you? Well… J.T was not really interested in the business. When Uncle Porko died, he sold his share, took off and gave me this knife. You know, Ah Tiong is a survivor. No… Ah Tiong is a winner. Say it, Haz. Ah Tiong… Ah Tiong… With more life. With more life, with more gusto. C’mon, Ah Tiong… Ah Tiong… - is a winner. - is a winner. Ah Tiong will bring the crowds back. Bring them all back. Bring them all-- Enough, enough. Pork. Hey, we have good adobo. Delicious Filipino food… Hi, thanks so much for coming. It was electrifying, wasn’t it? What’s your name? Chee Keong… There you go, thank you very much. Thank you, take care. Hi, what’s your name? Rockson. Oh, it’s you. Rockson… there you go. Thank you very much. Take care of yourself. Hello, what’s your name? Xiao Xiong. How do you spell that? B-A-B-Y B-E-A-R. Baby Bear? Right, okay. You are so inspiring. Thank you very much. There you go. Can you also write it in Chinese? Write your name in Chinese? Yes, please. Baby Bear? Xiao Xiong. Okay. You don’t know how to write ‘xiong’ (bear)? Sorry, no. I can help you. Yes, please. So sorry… You cannot write Chinese? Nah…SJI boy… You know, St. Joseph’s? Not personally. You’re not even joking. Okay. But I know Mr Chow. Sorry, are you a friend of Mr Chow? My boss is a friend of Mr Chow. Mr Chow says haibai. Wait… Mr Chow says ‘haibai’? Hi... Bye... My boss has taken his business. I mean… taken over his business. Take over. Anyway, here’s my card. It’s not the same. Me writing my name and you writing my name… It’s not the same. Thank you. Bye bye. Shit! No… my baby… Fuck… Thanks for the ride. Sure. You okay? Yeah. So…see you tomorrow? Tomorrow I have to take my mum and sister to temple. To temple? Yes, they go to Tai Yong Gong in Kallang. You never told me that your mum and sis were Taoists. Buddhists. I don’t foist my beliefs on them. That’s really… ecumenical of you. Yup. Okay, how about Wednesday? Are you okay? Wen, what’s wrong? Michelle… I think this is a mistake. I’m sorry… This is a mistake and I don’t think we should see each other anymore. I think we both know that we succumbed to the… Look, it was good while it lasted but… I’ll see you in church, okay, just… I’m sorry... Thank you. So… all this was… I’m sorry. Then why did you… So this is it? Michelle, I am a pastor. I am your pastor. This is an abuse of my... I’m not just letting myself down, okay. I’m letting the whole church down. Letting the church down. People depend on me. Yes, and I depend on you! What are you talking about? You’re a married woman! Your husband is less than fifty metres down the road… - He’s just waiting for you at home… - Wait… Don’t… Don’t use my husband, okay… - because this isn’t about my husband. - Okay… I’m sorry… You’re right. But this… this is still wrong. And you tell me now? It’s not too late. You tell me now! The Lord will forgive us if we just… if… if we repent. Not after we fucked for the first time… - I’m sorry. - Nor the second, nor the third, nor the fourth… Look, I said I’m sorry… but this is a sin! We’re just… we’re living in sin! Well, you didn’t think it was a sin when you had your cock in my mouth! For goodness sake, Michelle… Can you not talk like that, please. Oh, I’m sorry… I’m so sorry, Pastor. Am I being too vulgar? - Am I? - You don’t do that… - Am I offending your sweet, delicate… - There’s no reason for you to take this turn… - your sensitive… - Can you not… - your good Christian heart - I don't have to sit here and listen to you - with my potty mouth - talk to me like this… - with my… vulgarity - Shut the… - with my fucking sinner’s mouth… - Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Marie, what are you doing? Sir asked me to clean, Ma’am. It’s late, go to sleep, okay. Okay… Yes, Ma’am. Ruby, do that tomorrow. It’s okay, Ma’am. Listen, woman… Stop crying and answer me. Do you even listen at my workshops? No… No excuses, okay. I don't give a shit if you are pregnant. It’s not my problem. Listen, Irene, it’s very simple. If your numbers don’t go up by your second trimester I am kicking your fat ass off the team. Where have you been all day? You look…nice. Just church. Anyway, we need to talk about the flat, okay. Well… good evening, honey. I’m sorry… Anyway, we really need to talk about the flat, okay. I’m sorry, but we do! What’s there to talk about? The Lings are renewing. Really? Since when? Since yesterday. At the new rate? Old rate. For six months. Are you crazy? What? I promised them months ago! They just had twins! Anyway, if you’re thinking what I think you’re thinking… The answer is no. Okay, Terence. You are not selling the flat. It’s my parents’ flat. Michelle, listen… Michelle… this is no time to get sentimental over some stupid Housing Board flat in Tiong Bahru. Please! Does that flat really mean so little to you, Terence? Listen… you don’t understand. They came for me today. They vandalized my Porsche in the middle of Central carpark. I had to tow the bloody thing away… God, I hope nobody posts the bloody pictures online. You know what? I hope it was worth it. I hope you had a real adrenaline rush at the poker table-- God, how many times do we have to go through this? You know it was a one-off! Well, it was one hell of a one-off! How many times you want to hear this? You want me to say it, okay. You want me to apologize again, I will. Alright, Michelle. I’m sorry. Now I’m begging you to help me solve this problem. Why don’t you sell the Porsche? It’s not going to cover it. What do you mean ‘it’s not going to cover’? Terence, how much exactly do you owe this guy? There’s another guy. There’s a new guy. He’s from China. And China has taken over the local so… now I owe China. How much? And please… Terence, This has got to be the last time I’m asking you, okay? Three hundred and fifty grand. I swear. I don’t know how to help you... seriously, Terence. We have no more savings. I have no more savings. Okay, you know what, we’ll sell the house. Oh, c’mon. There’s no time… - We can’t sell this house. - We let go of the maids. We sell your paintings. We sell… the furniture. We sell the fucking furniture! Listen, Michelle. I’m sorry. Alright… I’m really sorry. I fucked up. But we’re going to be okay. We’re going to be more than okay. You know how I know? Because I’m sitting on these stocks… Please… just listen. I’m sitting on these stocks, which I know on very sound intelligence, are going to triple in value in less than one year. So all we need to do is just… sit tight and ka-ching. I promise. In the meantime, I just have to get this fucking Shanghai Shylock off my back. So… here’s the plan. I have at least two buyers and I know someone in the Housing Board who can help us expedite the paperwork. But… What I need you to do is to go and talk to the Lings - Terence. - very nicely… Terence. You are not selling my parents’ flat. For fuck’s sake, Michelle! Hello? Cindy? It’s Ona. Sorry to… I know you’re busy so I’m gonna cut to the chase. I’m in a bit of trouble and I need your help. The restaurant. Salmonella, right? You know about the restaurant? How? Yeah… I saw it in the news. You… you saw me in the news. Yeah. You didn’t think, maybe, call and ask-- Are you going to start with the emotional blackmail again? So? You’re in some kind of trouble. You need money? Actually… But it’s not my money. It’s Ryan’s, you know. You don’t have to be so… Are… are you… Are you doing yoga? Yah. Why? What are you wearing? Ona, it’s none of your business! Look, C… I wouldn’t be asking if it wasn’t for Popoy. He was the one who put the idea in my head. He’s getting to that age. You know, he’s starting to ask questions about you… About us… But… I never say anything bad about you, okay. I always tell him it was my fault, I… upset you. I upset you and you had every right to be mad at me for-- How much do you need? Don’t you even want to know how he is? C, I know it’s hard… Let’s just keep this short and simple okay, Ona? How much do you need? Eighty thousand. Eighty thousand! Ninety. Five. Ona, are you mad? I know it sounds-- A hundred thousand! You know I’ll pay you back. I can lend you ten, maybe twenty thousand but… a hundred thousand? Ona… if the restaurant is not working out, why don't you just shut it down! Cut your losses! You don’t understand. It’s not just about the money. Then what is it about? Your uncle’s ‘legacy’? Your heritage? You’re gonna give me that story again? It’s a coffeeshop in a shopping mall! You know what? Forget it. Just forget it. Sorry I called. But thanks for reminding me it’s a good thing you left. You’re a monster… you’re a monster… You’re a monster! Not now! Shall I come back later? Oh! Shit! I mean… No… Here you go. Only so little? Well, if you want quick cash then yes. I mean… Listen… At such short notice, the guy knew something was up. If you’d given me one more week, I’m sure I could have gotten more money for you. - Your boss would’ve gotten more… - The balance is… Two hundred and eighty thousand. Alright. Listen, Baby. Mister Baby. Bear. I have money. But it’s just locked up in certain assets right now. So, if you give me three months, just three months, I’m sure I can get you every last cent-- Is that a bullet? Is that a real bullet? This is Singapore. Why have you got a bullet? - Where did you get that bullet? - Mister Sky. I have some… paintings at home. I’m sure they’re worth… at least… one hundred thousand. So… you give me one hundred thousand in… One week. What? One week. One week? I was going to give you two weeks. But one week is good. My boss will be happy. And the rest? My wife has a flat in Tiong Bahru. I’m sure I can convince her to sell it. There is a small problem. The tenants, the Lings, they’ve just renewed the lease. So… You know… Somehow, if you can… you know. I mean… I’m open to suggestions. I’ll help you. Nobody gets hurt, okay! Over the past few weeks, we’ve touched on what it means to be an authentic disciple by not only listening to but applying biblical truths. This week, we’ll like to touch on the subject of what it means to be within an accountable relationship. We here at the Church feel that this is best exemplified by your relationship with a cell group or with your pastor. The Church is often referred to as the Body of Christ. That is why we feel the… You can’t be serious. I am serious. Michelle-- It wouldn’t be a sin then, right? Michelle-- If I divorce him, I leave him… Don’t you think… I mean… Look, it’s only been… what… So what, Wen? So what? So, you’re being very impulsive. Just come with me. Michelle, this is… This is crazy. Crazy? Hey, you’re the one who shares the same bedroom with your mother and you’re calling me crazy. I’m so sorry… I’m sorry, Wen. I’m so sorry… I know I shouldn’t have said… I know she’s not well. I know that was a low blow. I’m sorry… But please, please… Just come with me. Why do we have to leave the country? Because I’m doing something! I’m doing it! Look… All you have to do is come with me. We’ll fly off to some island, okay? We’ll fly off to Gili Meno. Okay? We’ll do nothing but make love for weeks. And after that… we can plan for our future together. Or not. We can do anything we want. I don’t even know where Gili Meno is. Just come with me. What if I say I can’t? Then you stay and I’ll go anyway. And I’ll never come back. Michelle. Bartender, double vodka guava juice please. Pink. Bad day? Me too. I just came from a party next door. What. A crap. Party. These boutique launches, they always attract the biggest posers. You know the type? You know the type… where the girls all dress like Christians. And the guys… Oh my god, the guys… with their ties and their ear studs… What does that mean? Sorry? “Dressed like Christians.” What the hell does that mean? I mean I’m Catholic… but even I think it’s offensive. And why would you go to a party you know is going to be crappy and full of posers. What does that make you? Shit… Sorry… you were just being sociable. No… you’re right. I sound like a… Forget it. Can we start over? Okay. Bartender, double vodka guava juice please. Pink. You want one? No. - C’mon let me buy you a drink. - No, I’m okay. It’s just a drink. Scotch. So, what do I do with all these lawsuits? I’m the victim here but instead of arresting the real culprit, I get sued out of my pants. It’s fucked up right? So, I talked to my lawyer, no… I begged my lawyer, to see if there’s any way we can argue that my cook was clinically insane. I mean, this psycho from China, he willfully collected his own shit and stirred it into my adobo. He pooed in my adobo. Who the hell does that? Only someone who’s really cuckoo. So, did your guy go for it? The insanity argument. No. He says the judge won’t buy it. “Your cook clinically insane. How can your cook be clinically insane? I mean, these fuckers put melamine into milk for their own babies and they won’t even blink their eyes for half a second. You think putting shit in your food is insane? In their culture, it’s probably just… seasoning.” Hey! It’s his words, not mine. I’m screwed. No, you’re not screwed. I’m finished. Everything is going to be fine. You’ll see. With all due respect to a beautiful lady, you don’t know shit. You don’t know me. Well, tell me something about you that I don’t know. Well… I’m the sort of person who... I’m stingy. No, not really stingy. I’m thrifty, but in a weird sort of way. You see… Once in a while, I’ll go out there and I’ll buy something really extravagant. What, like a car? No. Like a dress. Like a thousand-dollar dress. So, clearly I’m not stingy. But when I’m at home, I’m totally obsessed about the way we spend the little things. Like toilet paper, like electricity… And I hate wasting food. I hate it. I’m always eating my boyfriend’s leftovers. Isn’t that weird? No. Listen… I think I can help you. Not with your business, okay. But with your rent. What, you have a spare apartment lying around? As it happens, I do. It’s a four-room walk-up in Tiong Bahru. Tiong Bahru. I don’t think so. $1,700 a month. $1,700! That’s like… half the market rate. You’re not bullshitting me, right? This is all happy drunky talk? No… You know what? You can sublet one of the rooms if you don’t need it. I’ll close one eye. You can call my agent. Here. Why are you helping me? We just met. Spare me that. I said I could help you. I mean it. But I’d like some assurance on your part. So if you can… you can… pay me six months’ deposit? Six months? Yes, as a mark of trust. How do I know if you’re a good tenant? It’s a two-way street. Okay. I’ll take a look. To strangers? There I was, thinking… it was going to be the luckiest day of my life. Quite sad, really. Sad? It’s sad, right? You’re lonely. You meet a woman in a bar. You seem to connect. But what does she offer you? Love? Or even just sex. No! She offers you… a discount on the rent. Was I surprised that she was capable of swindling another person? Well, yes. I was. Very surprised. I had to leave before Terence destroyed me. I’d given him all my savings and Tong Wen was going to give what little he had to his mother. And anyway, it was my decision to leave so I had to pay for my own escape. Once she gets it into her head to do something and she persuades herself that it’s true, then… But… I was the one who drove her to it, so… I think at that time, the fact that Onassis had a son, I… I just blocked it out. I just… blocked it out. Oi! Your grandfather’s road, is it? Fuck you! Yah, your grandfather’s road, is it? Fuck you! Oi, what did I tell you about the ‘F’ word? It’s NC16. M18. How old are you? Sorry, Tatay. And why do you have to bring that thing everywhere you go? Kids in the U.S. always bring guns to school. Only the psycho ones. Besides, this is not the U.S, this is Singapore. Here, exams kill people, not guns. C’mon, Anak. Just leave it. Did you do your Chinese essay? Why don’t we go and live in Manila? Are you serious? I just got us a new flat. I’m getting the keys today and now you’re telling me you want to go and live in Manila? Why? You’re not happy? Believe me. This flat is beautiful. You will love it. We’ve got four rooms. Four rooms, Anak! You can have your own room now, if you want. And the living room… it’s big enough for a ping pong table, okay. Sure, or not? Two ping pong tables! And the last tenant left his hundred-inch television behind. Can you imagine what the soccer matches will be like? Our luck is changing, Popoy. Who knows… Maybe tomorrow, ICA will call to say they are giving me my pink IC. What’s so good about a Pink IC? What is this? Social Studies? Look… it’s not that I don’t want to be a Filipino. But… I want to be a Singaporean, like you. Who wouldn’t? Why? What’s wrong with this place? It’s okay. It’s… It’s okay?? Everything here is clean. Everything works. I don’t have to worry about you taking the bus. The roads are smooth. Traffic is great. Oi! Are you driving a car or a turtle! You know what… I grew up in a pretty good part of Manila and even that was shitty. Phone cables everywhere… they’re like giant spider webs. And the roads are full of potholes. It’s like driving on the moon. Everywhere is dirty. Polluted. Chaotic. And the corruption. Oh my golly, the corruption. Do you even know what corruption is? Can I have two dollars. And… eighty cents for a mini Mars bar? That’s exactly it. Sorry, I was… This looks like loansharks. No shit, Alfred Einstein. You got the keys? Yes. It’s Albert. What? Albert Einstein, not Alfred Einstein. Okay professor, just… Just give it to me. You want a girl? Can we talk in my car? What the fuck was that? What the fuck was that! I don’t know. Did you see… what they did to my place? My place. Who are those girls? I don’t know! You don’t know? I don’t know. I’m as stunned as you! She’s not picking up. All right… Who are you? Are you a real property agent? Yes! Yes, I am! See, here’s my license… Who’s Michelle? She’s my client. Is that really her flat? Yes! I gave this woman $10,000 in cash. It’s all I had. I did it because she said it was a good deal and she looked pretty honest. Now, you tell me. Is this a good deal… or am I being screwed. No. No, you’re not. The flat is hers-- Then who the fuck are those women upstairs! I really don’t know! You call her right now. You call her from your phone and put it on speaker. Okay. Okay? Hello. Taxi? Cancel booking. Don’t need to come anymore, okay? Thank you. Now you tell me what’s going on, right now. I don’t know. Hey… - Are you in this together? - I… - She told you not to come. - I don’t… - Where? - I don’t know. - Not to come where? - Just let go of me! - You better show me… - Let go… You better take me to her… Hey! Why are you trying to run away! I wasn’t! You were grabbing me! No! Why the fuck are you running away? I wasn’t… trying to run… away! - You were grabbing me! - Drive! - What is that! What is that! - Drive! Is that a gun! Is that a gun! Why do you have a gun in Singapore! Oh my geez! - You have a gun… - Drive! Okay… Just take me to her, fuckface! Okay! Wait! I’m starting… Alright! I’m… going! Now, you better tell me the fucking truth. The paperwork you drew up for me… It’s fake? It’s bullshit? Yes. Sorry, we didn’t mean to hurt anyone… Motherfucker! You fucking pussy coward! You still say you’re a real property agent! I am! You see my license… Look… Okay, when she told me about you, I realized you were the guy from the papers a few months ago. The guy being sued for the salmonella epidemic. Epidemic? It’s not an epidemic… - Alright… Any… - Six cases is not… Anyway, I told her that we have to pick someone else. I said… this guy, he’s going to be desperate for cash himself and we have to pick someone else. What did she say? You said, pick someone else. What did she say? She didn’t say anything. She didn’t… She’s desperate too. Bitch. That fucking bitch. That motherfucking bitch! You don’t call her that! Because… Her situation is not great either. You have to believe me. You will not believe-- You think I give a fuck about her situation right now?? No. You guys… You’re not human. You don't even have a heart. There are a thousand rich guys out there for you to cheat… but do you cheat them? No. You choose the fucking foreigner. It’s not because-- The fucking guy who has been kicked to the… to the curb… to the fucking curb. That bitch thinks I’m so stupid, that I’m so horny that she can just walk into a bar, show up in a sexy dress and think I’m gonna just grab any deal she offers? You did. Well, you still chose the fucking wrong guy! I just want that money… I just need that money… You’re gonna give it back to me. ‘Cos if you don’t… I’m gonna make sure… you fucking regret it. Shit… Hey. Hey… What are you doing back? Forgot my file and I spilled my bloody coffee in the taxi. I tell you, these fucking cabbies, they’re useless. The guy brakes like a fucking epileptic And all the time he’s just whining about the government. Government this, government that… Please… just shut the fuck up, Uncle, and drive. I’m already late. You’re gonna kill us both. His taxi smells like a Housing Board void deck. I swear something was rotting in the trunk. And at the traffic light, he even had the cheek to ask me to please take a photograph with him. And then he continues to bitch about the government. I don’t understand these people, you know. They can bitch about the government, then they vote for the government and then they bitch about the government again. I don't understand! I tell you… the bloody Transport Minister, whatever his name is, better do something about it. First, please make sure that every taxi driver knows how to drive. And second, please make sure every taxi driver knows how to speak bloody English… How come you’re not in school? Not feeling well, so… Are you okay? What’s wrong? I’m okay. Just a migraine. So I took medical leave. Listen, you just rest. Okay, I… I gotta go. See you. Fuck! What is this? Just some clothes I was gonna give to the Salvation Army. Oh really. The Salvation Army. And… were you also going to give away cash to the Salvation Army? - Terence. - Listen… We’re already damn near dry of cash and you were gonna give away… how much is this? Michelle, what’s going on? Were you gonna just up and leave without telling me? - As if I don’t have enough shit to deal with already! - I need some time away! Terence… I just need some time away, okay? Time away? Where are you gonna go? Just a short trip. Don’t bullshit me, okay. Just tell me the truth, please. Am I interrupting? No… Mister Baby Bear. The gate open. The door open. Very open house. You’re going somewhere? No, but she is… No, no, that money… You can deduct that from my account, right? You’re in trouble. No, she’s in trouble. No. You’re in trouble. You still have so many paintings in your house. Yah. Listen, I… It’s not very easy to find buyers… You said $100,000 in one week. You said. Yes, I know I said-- But it’s now three weeks! Are you toying with me?? Listen… I sold my Porsche, right? Look… - Whatever you’re thinking of doing, - Keep talking, keep talking… - please don’t do it, okay… - Go on… Still talking! Oh my god, is that a real gun! Listen… Mister Baby Bear, there is… no need for this, okay. I… I promise. You’ll… get your $100,000 - in two days. - No. Now, it’s $120,000. $120,000. I… I already have two potential buyers… Hello. Taxi? Cancel booking. Don’t need to come anymore, okay? Thank you. Who is it? Taxi. I… Why did you sound so strange? Yeah, why did you sound so strange? Why? Because you have a gun pointed at my husband. - Was that really taxi? - Woah… - Yes! Yes! - Mister Baby Bear… - Who is it? - No, no, no… - It was a friend. - Please, please… It was a church friend. It really was a church friend! Why did you pretend he was a taxi driver? Why? I see. Now I understand. Understand… understand what? You shut up! You and your wife’s problems, not my business. My business is money. You pay me in two days. Then sell her flat and pay me the rest. Wait, wait… What flat? Tiong Bahru. Sky told me the tenant is no good. So… I made them… Now, you can sell the flat. How much does he owe you? No, wait. How much did he borrow in the first place? $400,000. With 20% interest per month plus two months’ late payment, the total is… $432,000. And you… My tenants have not… They’re in China visiting relatives. Then tell them to leave! No police. This is it. She lives here? What the fuck… Get out. Out! Oh, you have friends… Everybody! Stay calm! He has a gun. Nobody panic. Michelle, just give him back the money and he’ll go. He has a gun? He has a gun? You have a gun? He has a gun? This is Singapore! Why do you have a gun? Mister… is it true? Who are you? He’s a…friend. Who are you? I recognize you from somewhere. You’re the guy on TV… that actor, Terence Cao. Chia! Terence Chia! Just call me Sky, okay? Are you the syndicate leader? Wait, wait… This is my house. What syndicate? What are you talking about? How do you know this woman? Is her name really Michelle? Yah, she’s my wife. You’re her husband? She said she had a boyfriend. She did? Could be this guy. Your wife and this bullshit property agent cheated me… Wait… Property agent? I thought you said he’s your pastor? He is. Which company? Apex. Fucking Apex! You’re a pastor? I am… I’m her pastor. I’m also a property agent, just not her property agent. They rented me a flat. She claims it’s her flat. It is my flat, Onassis. When I show up the front door has paint splashed all over - and there are a bunch of prostitutes - Wait, wait. squatting in the living room! Prostitutes? That’s what happens when you go with fucking Apex. You know what? I don't really care… what criminal business you are all into. I don’t give a fuck about that. I just need my ten grand back. And I’m not leaving this house - without my… - Sir. Your money… is here. Why do you have my money? Are you the syndicate leader? Are you PRC syndicate? Onassis, look. There is no syndicate… Mister. Maybe all this business is none of my business. But this man said you have a gun. Only criminals and police have guns. Are you a criminal? Or… Are you police? I’m not police. Mister Baby Bear… He’s an ordinary guy. - He owns a restaurant… - With gun? Yah, with gun? What kind of ordinary guy has a gun! - This is Singapore… - Enough! Fuck! He has a gun! Enough talking! Put the money on the table! Just give him the money! Yah, there’s no need for this. Just give him the money. What’s $10,000 to you? Think of the bigger picture. You read my book… On the fucking table! Okay. Put it down. Why does he have a gun! Why does everybody have a gun! This is Singapore! Nobody’s suppose to have a gun! Look, Mister Baby Bear, this man is innocent. I don’t like other people taking my boss’ money. Look, Mister. I’m not a gangster. Clearly you are. But I don’t judge. I see what’s happening here. These two, they owe you money and they scammed me to pay you. But I’m in a serious financial difficulty at the moment so I need this $10,000. Let me just take this money and go and I promise I will say nothing about what’s happened here. Just… I have a son. My gun… It’s my son’s toy pistol. You can check. Can I just… take the money and go? I promise. I won’t say a word. He says he won’t say anything. Okay, you can go. But… the money is mine. Please… I… I need this money. I cannot leave this… - house without the money. - You are already so lucky… I’m letting you go. So go. Onassis, I have some money. It’s not much but I can transfer it to you… No. You will not. If you call the police, think about your son. Onassis… I’m so sorry. Can you just go? She says you are her pastor? Yes. I’m also her friend. She asked me to help… she needed some help… And you are so helpful because… I told you, I’m her friend. You were going to leave with her. Is that true? I just helped her to get the money from Onassis. I just helped her as a friend. No. He was going to leave with me. I’m sorry, Terence. Sorry. Forgive me. Sorry. You’re sorry. You cut off his fucking hand! We need something. We need something… We need to tie up his arm… We need something to tie up his arm… Towels in the suitcase… Is he dead? Still breathing. Who else lives here? Parents? We live alone. Maid? We… had to let them go. Them? What do you mean ‘them’? We had two. You had two maids. You had two maids, you live in this house and you still had the guts to… Move. Move! My name is Onassis Hernandez. Watching this, reliving this memory, what’s going through your mind right now? Onassis. I wish… I wish there was a way I could erase it. Well it’s… It’s like watching… It’s like watching somebody else’s life. Michelle? These people are the real  criminals, not me! They are property scammers and they cheated me of $10,000. My… life savings. So, for the police, I will repeat myself. I only have one demand. Bring me my son and send me a helicopter with a pilot. The helicopter must arrive within four hours, before 8.07pm. Only the pilot will know my destination. If you don't meet this demand, if you don't give me the only thing I ask for, I will start hurting these people. I will cut off a hand from these people every half an hour until you provide a safe departure for me and my son. Finally… this part of the message is for my son, Popoy. Anak, if you are watching this… Don’t be scared, okay. I’m sorry I had to do this. But Tatay didn’t have a choice. Okay so just… stay home, be cool, okay? Someone will bring you to me. That video was posted on Facebook by restaurant owner Onassis Hernandez, who is at the centre of a hostage situation - Oh, child… - taking place at 97 Stevens Road, - I’m so sorry… - the home of former actor Terence Chia. Onassis Hernandez! Look I just want to talk! Onassis, I’m Inspector Azman… Look… Onassis, I’m Inspector Azman, okay. I’m in charge here. Now, I promise I’m gonna try my best to get you out of here safely, okay? But first, first things first, I need to see if everybody in there is okay. Please. Okay, I’m coming in, alright? Slow down… Lock the door. Okay, okay. That's enough… Move… Onassis. The guy needs medical attention. I know. But he’s not going to get any until you give me what I ask for. Listen, Onassis… Can I call you Onassis? Look, we’ve checked the flat at Tiong Bahru, okay. Found the girls. Even the officer-in-charge there, my colleague, he’s informed me that those girls are illegals. Now those girls have also identified their employer as that guy in there. Do you know who that guy is? He’s the No. 3 guy in a PRC syndicate that we’ve been tracking for months. Now, you’ve actually helped us identify and arrest a major criminal here. So… you can help me? You can bring me my son? And you can get me that helicopter? Your son is fine. He’s on the way, okay. I’m trying with the helicopter. I’m trying. I don’t care how you make it happen, just make it happen. Okay, but I need more than three hours. Listen, I know why you’re doing this. I know you acted out of desperation and you didn’t mean any harm but I need you to work with me here. Out of goodwill, why don’t you just give me one hostage? You bring me my son. You let him talk to me. And then maybe I’ll give you one hostage. Okay. But I’m going to need more time. Just cooperate… and do as I say… and you’ll be fine… Everything’s going to be fine. Why the hell did you have to do that? Spill everything to the world like that. Even if we get out of here, how the hell are we gonna live? How are we gonna show our faces in public? We’re fucked. No. You’re fucked. Do you really think that guy’s gonna get you a helicopter? So you can fly out of here? Get real, okay! This is Singapore, alright. This isn’t the bloody Philippines. We don’t do negotiation here. We don’t turn a hostage situation into a fucking soap opera. You know what he’s gonna do? He’s gonna send the commandos in here. And they’re gonna spray a dozen bullets in your chest. And maybe us too while they’re at it. Maybe. But whose fault is that? Why don't you ask your wife and her lover. Whose fault is that? Fuck you... Fuck all of you! - Shut up! - Terence… Hey, Michelle. Your boyfriend over there… Is he a good fuck? Does he have a big cock? How big is it? Three inches? Four inches? Do you suck his balls? - I bet you like that right? - Terence! - I bet you let him sit on your face, right? - Shut up! You like that? Hey, you know why my wife is so good at conning people? You know why she’s so good with her mouth? She’s got a secret. Come here, I’ll tell you what it is. Come… You’ll love it. Fucking let us go! Motherfucker! Don’t make it harder than it already is. How do you work this? The red button. …it's a disturbing video and, assuming it isn’t a hoax, the anti-immigration lobby is gonna have a field day with it. But the question is… why would you put up a video like that when there’s no message, there’s no indication whether the person behind the camera is an accomplice or a victim… I mean, was the person who posted the… Onassis. Onassis! - Ruby, listen to me. - Where is the other maid? - She’s the only one here. - There’s no other maid, okay. - Ruby, I’m so sorry. - Onassis. Onassis! - Please don’t hurt her. - Ruby, you do exactly as he says. Onassis… Hello, C. Ona, please tell me this is some kind of joke. Hang on. This is no joke. Why? Why are you doing this? It’s a long story. Ona… You’re… just having a bad day. A bad day. A bad month! A bad year! I don't know! But this is crazy, Ona! Okay, listen. Just give me… fifteen minutes. Okay? I’ll come down… Don’t come here, just stay away. What are you going to do? What I said. No! Ona, no! You can’t do that! It’s too late, C. Listen… I know… I know I wasn’t a good wife to you but I can help you. Just turn yourself in. No. Ryan knows a lot of good lawyers. No. Ona, this isn’t going to work! It has to work! This has to work… or I’ll lose Popoy. I asked for your help once… …and you made me feel like a piece of shit. I know, I’m sorry… So you cannot tell me what to do. You just can’t. You know how you can help me? If I don’t manage… to get out of this… Can you let Popoy stay with you? Yes...yes, I’ll take care of Popoy. If you get out of this, Ona… you’re going to be famous. Right… Everybody will want to come to your restaurant now. And if not… I just want you to know. I love you. Beslan, Nairobi, and now incredibly, Singapore. A Filipino immigrant… … the hijacking of Singapore Airlines SQ117 in 1991, there has been no incidents involving hostages. …or face prosecution for gathering illegally. So far no one has moved and it remains to be seen if the police will take physical action or exercise calm and restraint. …we’re now hearing reports of attacks against foreign businesses… Where were you going to go, Michelle? To Gili Meno. We always talked about going there. Have you got your tickets? Yes. Which airline? SQ? Jetstar. How could you, Michelle. I know I can… be a real asshole, okay. But I could never be unfaithful to you. I know. Then why? Terence, do you really not know why? It was you, okay?? Listen, about the flat… I don't know what I was thinking. I know how much it means to you. It’s all yours now. What’s mine? The flat. I transferred my half over and told the lawyer to call you after I’d… after I had gone. After this is over… will you still leave? With him? She won’t. Don’t look at me like that. Water. Hey… You…owe me a hand. I want to go to the toilet. Or I’ll just shit here. Fuck… Fuck… I’m gonna trust you not to screw me more than you already have. What are you doing? Get the gun. Take him to the toilet. What? Get the gun. Point it at him. And take him to the toilet. Why don’t you do it? I’m not gonna touch that gun. You’re Mister Tough Guy, right? You’re the one who wants to beat up people. Here’s your chance. Get the gun. Point it at him. And take him to the toilet. Okay, just… Please don’t hurt her, okay. Fuck’s sake… Fuck… Okay… just… so you know…I’m really hopeless at this kind of thing, okay. I was… you know I fucking hated National Service… What the fuck was that?? Hold your positions! Fuck… Fuck…fuck! I’ll get the… I’ll get the first aid kit. I want to go to the toilet! Shut the fuck up! Stupid… I’m sorry, it was an accident, I swear. You almost shot your own wife. Onassis. Hey, Onassis! You come with me. Onassis, you there! Onassis! Hey! What the fuck man?? Is anybody hurt? Nobody’s hurt! Fuck, Onassis! You got a gun in there?? It’s not mine! It’s the Chinaman’s! Let me in! We’ll talk this way! Look, listen…Onassis… You're gonna come down here… …and give me the gun. Come down here! C'mon! Let's give him the gun… No… No, Terrence. Come one, we gotta give… No! You’re not gonna get anything until you meet my demands! Onassis… This is an escalation! You understand! Fuck you! Where is my son! Give me the gun! You think I’m an idiot?? Hey, relax! Relax, man! Relax! Relax! Don't do anything stupid! Where is my son. Okay, we’ll call your mobile! Sorry, man. Ruby… Are you okay? Yes, Ma’am. Come, Popoy. Tatay. Hey… Tatay, are you okay? I’m okay. Is that Mrs Heng with you? Old rate! Onassis! We’ll go back to the old rate! Tell her it’s okay. Tatay… what are you doing? What? Why must you do this? I didn’t have a choice. All my friends say you’re a terrorist. I’m not…I’m not a terrorist! Listen to me, okay? Please. In a while, they’re flying in a helicopter. Remember you wanted to ride in one? Here’s your chance. Where are we going, Tatay? I don’t know yet. Manila? Maybe… Only the pilot-- I don’t want to go to Manila, Tatay. I want to stay here. This morning you told me you wanted to-- I still have school, Tatay. I haven’t finished my science project. Tatay, please come out! Anak... I can’t. I just… Listen to me. We have no choice and we have to do this. So you have to be brave. You sit tight until the helicopter comes. Okay? You trust me? Yes. I love you. Okay, Onassis. Look… so now you’ve spoken to Popoy, right? Come on. Let me have a hostage, Onassis. Give me a hostage. We could do with some goodwill here. Onassis… Turn over the gangster. Let me have the gangster. Take the maid. The who?? Who the fuck else do you have up there? Okay, we got a maid coming out. The maid. Now, I gave you a hostage. You have exactly… forty seven minutes to get that chopper here. No. What do you mean, ‘no’? If you don’t get me the chopper, - I will start hacking… - Onassis. Onassis… you’re not gonna get any helicopter. I ask for one thing. Just one thing. Onassis. Look. You know what the government is like. I’ve tried my best. I told them… you don’t want any money. You’re not asking for money. Just give this guy his helicopter. But they said no. But here’s what they have to offer. Who exactly is ‘they’? The Home Affairs Ministry. The Home Affairs Minister himself. That’s right. From the top. What’s the offer? You surrender. Hey… listen to me now. Hang on. Listen to me first. You surrender. But we will release you to the Philippine Embassy after that. From there, they will take you and your boy to Manila. We’ll let your government decide your fate. My government? They are more sympathetic. Your whole country is more sympathetic. Bullshit! The moment I step out there, they’re gonna take me out. Onassis, I am not bullshitting, okay. Allah is my witness. If you don’t accept the deal, you throw an arm out at 8:07p.m. Otherwise, I will personally escort you and your son to the Ambassador’s office, okay? What do you think? I think you should accept the offer. It’s a trap. Wait… maybe not. Michelle’s right. I think you should accept the offer. Yes, you should accept. Who the fuck asked you, Baby Shit! ...protests continue in several major cities, calling for the Singapore government to release Mr Hernandez to the Philippine Embassy. So far the Ministry of Home Affairs in Singapore has not replied to queries from the BBC. Who are these people? I don’t know these people. And the people outside. Who cares about the people outside, Onassis. Look at this. Just turn yourself over to the Embassy. They’ll bring you back to Manila and probably won’t even press charges. And even if they do, you can just pay off the judge or something, right? I don’t want to go back. This is back. This… I’m not going to prison. I am not gonna lose my son. I’m not going to prison, I’m… I’m not. Onassis, So what’s your decision. Where is my helicopter? Hey… stop fucking around. I’m not bullshitting-- Shut up. Shut up, Azman! I don’t care what your Minister promises. I don’t believe you. I want that helicopter. Onassis… No. Do you really want the whole world to see an arm tossed out of the front door? In front of all the cameras? Huh? Shit hits the fan for the world’s safest city. Your investors… Your reputation, huh? Just like that. Your whole fucking economy! You fucking stop talking. You listen to me right now, okay. I’ve done everything I can. You understand? I need you to make a decision right now! Either you let me take you to the Philippine Embassy or we’ll come in and take you-- Fucking liar! Fucking liar! God help me. Wait, wait… listen, listen… I… I need my hands. Okay? And Michelle too. She’s a drama teacher. Take his. You already have one of my hands. If you take the other one, I won’t be able to take a piss! Who the fuck cares whether you can or cannot take a piss! Fuck you! Fuck you back! - Take mine! - Fuck! No. Take mine. No. Take it! No! Take it. Tell them I’m up here. Don’t want the church to see me on TV. Don’t. Onassis! Please… step forward. Mr and Mrs Chia, please step away from Onassis. Just come over and get us, okay? Guys, guys, holster your weapons. Holster your weapons. It’s cool. It’s cool. It’s cool. Holster your weapons. It’s okay. Onassis. Onassis. Now… step forward. Onassis. Please. Sir! Put the knife down. Please, put down your weapon. Put the knife down. Guys, guys, it’s okay. Holster, holster your weapons! Holster your weapons. Sir. I need you to put the weapon down. Sir. I need you… I need you, to put down the knife. Put down the knife now. M2 Shoot to Kill. I repeat. M2 Shoot to Kill. Tatay. Anak. - Anak… - Tatay… Your mum’s gonna take care of you. Be brave… Tatay… Onassis, you never made it to the Philippine Embassy. No. In fact, you did time. Well, you all did time for your crimes. Terence and Michelle, how did you actually cope with prison life? Prison was a very… very humbling experience. At first it was really depressing. After a while, I don’t know… I read a lot of books… And… I had time to… think about my life and reflect on my actions. I decided that when I got out, things were gonna change. I won’t pretend that… it wasn’t hard. I mean you can drive yourself crazy with your own thoughts. I kept thinking, I’ll be out in a few months but Tong Wen’s gonna be stuck in there for years. I’ll always feel guilty about that. What do you want me to say? What the f*** do you want me to say? And whilst you were serving out your sentence, your son, Popoy, was placed in the care of your ex-wife, Cindy. That was the silver lining. It made things a lot easier knowing that, Popoy was okay. So what are your plans now? Well, you’ve heard about the movie. Yes, a remarkable story. A telemovie is being made about your experiences and the director has asked you to play yourselves in it. Why do it? Well, for me, it’s a bit like going back to my roots as an actor. Which is not as weird as you think because… It’s not like I’m playing myself. I’m playing this character called ‘Sky’. I do think it’s a bit weird. And I wasn’t going to do it if Onassis had any objections. But he said… He said it was okay. Onassis? The money is good. But definitely it’s gonna be a one-off gig for me. The restaurant is still my core business. How are things at the restaurant? We received a lot of donations. I mean, me and my partner. It was hard at first but… it’s pretty much back on track now. Onassis, do you in any way feel… betrayed by the Singapore government? No. They could have given me a longer sentence. And it could’ve been worse. They could’ve deported me. But they didn’t. What of your citizenship application? What’s happening there? I haven’t heard anything from them…so I guess it’s still pending. Still hoping?
