I believe that an open road is a metaphor to life. Some days you can see for miles, everything's clear. Other times, what's just beyond the headlights is dark and unknown. But if you keep control, if you believe in yourself, you can make it through any twists and turns, no matter how it might otherwise seem. - I hate thunder. - It was just the wind. Come on, time for bed. Come on, buddy, double time, come on. Breaker went off again. Come on, keep going. Okay. - You know, I used to be afraid of storms too until your grandma told me exactly what thunder was. - It's a refraction of atmospheric pressure when lightening moves faster than the speed of sound. - Mm, no, thunder is God letting out a very, very big burp. - You're weird. - Yeah, well, guess what, it's hereditary. Goodnight, kiddo. Love you. - I love you too. Sweet dreams. - To the brightest, the shrewdest, the wisest, and by far the brashest investment broker in all of Kansas City, Karen Reese. Thank you. - Hey, hey you! - Hey. Congratulations! Thank you. - So when are you gonna make her partner? - Ah yeah, right, you need the jaws of life to pry anything out of this guy. - That is not true. I'm not cheap. - Lenny, hey, how are you? This is my brother-in-law, Lenny. This is Alex. - Hey. - Donna, of course, you know, my bossy older sister. - Oh yeah, great, okay, thank you. That would be me. - And this is ah. - Oh, Denis Teague, one of our new consultants. Just moved here from New York. You two met briefly last week at Brubaker's. - Yeah, I remember. - It's nice to see you again. - Nice to see you. - Karen, that's the song from the thing. - That's the song from the thing. - Gotta dance. - We gotta dance. - See ya later. - You, come.

I move their money to the right places, exciting, huh? - Are you good? - I'm the best. - Oh, my God, I can't breath. Woo, I hate this humidity. I hate it. I swear to God I am moving to Arizona. So, where's this Randy guy? I thought I'd get to meet him. - Ah, Randy Stroud is over. - Oh. - He was a bit overbearing. - Ooh, do tell. Ah, well, he sent me three emails a day, absolutely convinced that we're meant for each other, and on our third date he pulls out the calculator and divides the bill. - We call her The Terminator. - No, but listen to this. Then he asks me to cover the tip. - Oh. - Nobody gets past the third date. - Mm, I love this song. - Oh, no, no, no. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. - Ah no, I don't dance. - Come on, yes you do.

Hi. - What a surprise. Yeah, what a coincidence. - Yeah. - Nice to see you. - You too. - Good to see you again, Denis. - You too, Donna. - I think I'm gonna go get the boys some water. - Hey, I had a lot of fun the other night. - So did I. - Um, would you like to have dinner with me sometime? I know this is really awkward. I would've asked you the other night, but I'm kind of out of practice with this. - I would love to have dinner with you. - Yeah? Mm hmm. - Okay, I'll call ya. - You don't have my number. - I'll get it from Lenny. No, no, we ended up hiking through Thailand, and Myanmar, Vietnam for about three weeks. It was incredible. - Wow, that's amazing. I was just talking to my sister last week about Thailand. It's my dream vacation. - Why don't you go? - Ah, you know, I'm a single mother. Justin's way too young. - Well, couldn't his dad take care of him why you were away? Oh, sorry, that's a prying question. No, it's okay. I'm an open book. Um, John and I were only married for a couple of years. He was very controlling which doesn't suit me at all. - Oh. - And now he has obligations to Justin, which he rarely fulfills, which upsets Justin, and is John's little way of getting back at me. - Sorry, that's too bad. - What about you? Have you ever been married? - Once, it ended very badly, which is why I'm so out of practice, but I hope I'm doing better than ah, what's his name, Randy Stroud. - Oh, please don't mention that name. - Sorry. - I think you're doing great. This is wonderful. Wine list, sir. - Thank you. I'm a Merlot drinker. - So am I. That's all I have. - Oh, oh, great. Um, Bremer Estates. - Ooh, a connoisseur. - It's the only one I knew how to pronounce. - So what's your dream vacation. - Oh, I don't think it's where you go so much as who you go with that makes it a dream vacation. - Hmm, I like that answer. - What, he can't afford roses? - I don't like roses. Freesias are my favorite. - Wagner needs an amended deal memo by the end of the week. I'm on it. - I figured. I know freesias are your favorite. - Okay, besides the fact that you're my boss, I am five years older than you, which means you're way too old for me, sweetie. - You think I'm teasing. - You are. Hey, Dad. - Hey, sport. - Okay, goodnight, sweetie. No junk food. - I know, have fun. - So who is this guy? - None of your business, John. - It is if it involves Justin. Have fun. - Wow, these butterflies are beautiful. - Caught them myself actually. - Would you do, hunt them down with a little bow and arrow? - No, chloroform in a jar. I know that sounds really awful, but it's actually quite painless. It was a hobby of mine when I was a kid. I, I, I didn't have the greatest childhood. I guess butterflies made me think that my life could turn into something beautiful too, you know? Try this.

Randy was so obsessive when we went out, and a black rose? What does he think, he's being subtle? - Did you talk to him? - Left a message. Told him in no uncertain terms to leave me alone. Just creeps me out that he would show up here. - Well, it should. This is your home. You've got a son. - I'm gonna hold onto this, just in case he decides to make another appearance, and I have to get a restraining order. - Good idea. - You've got battery backup if you lose power. Call the 800 number. Mm hmm. - They'll log you in and get you online. Great. Should be all set. - Here, I'll show you out. Thank you. Thank you. - Why, what did I do? - Ah, it's just nice having you here while this is going on. - You're welcome. - What're you up to this weekend? - Nothing. - Want to come to my parents house? They have a beautiful place. It's on a river, cool breeze, best sweet tea you'll ever have. - I'd love to. - Hey, this is Denis. This is my guy, Justin, and his main man, Anthony. - Hey there, sport. - Come on. - I think I'll take that as my cue to, to go. Call you tomorrow. - Okay. Oh, um, can you do me a favor? Would you mind mailing these? They're invites for Justin's birthday party. There's a mailbox at the end of Pine Street. They still pick up tonight. - Yeah, sure, sure. Anything else you want me to do, like wash you car, clean your gutters, mow your lawn? - I know, using up all my privileges, aren't I? You're great. So, do I have your approval? - Dad calls me sport. - I know, but he doesn't know that. He didn't mean anything by it. You know nothing and no one could ever come between us. Hey. Love you, kiddo. That's what I'm talking about. - I love you, Mom. Come on, Karen, you've been on your own for six years, ah. - Well, I like being on my own. Is there a limit to how long a woman could be single? I like my life. I don't need a man. We just want good things for you, sweetie. It seems like such a great match. I mean you both have the same tastes. It's like you guys have known each other your whole lives. I know, I know. So what's the problem? Ah, there isn't one. I think that's the problem. Hmm. I know. Like things are actually going my way for once. Hi, sport, everything all right? Well, I don't know how to use it. Oh, your father never taught you how to fish, huh? No, well, bobber fishing when I was little. I didn't like hooking the worms. Ah, yeah, me neither. There's a much better way to fish, here. I'll show you how to cast. Okay. - Stand up, over here. The secret to a good cast, you're gonna hold on tight to the rod. Uh huh. - Push your thumb down on that button and keep it down. - Okay. You try, you right-handed or left-handed? Ah, left. Okay, so you stand like this. Finger there. Right. Thumb on the button. Take the rod, thumb on button, hold it down. Bring it back and swing it up. - See, I am always right about these things. - Yeah, well, we'll see. I already have a trail of broken men in my wake. Why destroy another perfectly good one? - Hmm, don't be such a pessimist. - I'm not being a pessimist. - I think he's very sweet, and taking time with Justin like that, it's lovely. Mm hmm. - Takes a lot of practice and don't be discouraged, okay? It's a right of passage. - Did, did your dad ever teach you how to fish? - No. Come on, try again. You're doing great. Okay. - Is that the first time that Justin's fished like that? - Yeah. There you go. - Here are the Wagner redlines, and Royals tonight, first base, punch it. - Oh, yeah, I can't. I'm going on a date with Denis. I'm already late. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, so they're in last place, but come on, this is baseball. Karen, you love baseball. - I know I love baseball. Next weekend, I promise, I gotta run. - Whoa, whoa, first, first base. Are you sure no one could see us? - We're in the middle of nowhere. Ah, cheers. - Cheers. - How would you like to come with me to the Caribbean next week? I've got some business in the Grand Cayman's. The Grand Cayman's? Mm hmm. - Wow, you're serious? - Mm hmm, we'll get a private little bungalow. We'll have our own beach. Sounds amazing, but I, I can't. I can't leave Justin and I really can't leave until this Wagner deal is closed and you're mad. - No, no, of course not. I just wanna spend more time with you. - Well, I'd like that too. It's just not a good time for me to do that right now. - I think I'm falling in love with you. I don't wanna response to that. I just, I just wanted to say it. - I'm glad you did. So, any ideas for your birthday tomorrow? - Well, you already know. I want that new MTB mountain bike. I told you I don't think you're gonna get it. It's kind of expensive. Plus you just got a new bike last year. - Yeah, but that bike's so tight, Mom, and nobody else has one yet. - Better start saving your allowance then. - Mom? Mm hmm? - Can Denis come to my party? - You kinda like him, huh? - He's cool. You gonna have to let him spend the night sooner or later, you know? I don't care. - Do I even want to know how you know about these things? - Come on, I'm in fourth grade. - Oh, right. Hello? Hmm. Hello? - Who was it? - I don't know. Squirrels. - So, you ever been married? - Justin. - No, that's, that's okay. Um, yes, I have. - Kids? - No. - Do you wanna have kids? - Well, that would depend. - On what? - On who I decided to get married to. - You gonna marry my mom? - Okay, that's enough. You clear your plate and go upstairs, get ready for bed. Okay. - See ya later, sport. Yeah, see ya, Denis. - Rules were meant to be broken. I'll behave myself. - No, you won't. Mm hmm. - Mom. Oh. - I heard those noises again. - We have an attic above the garage and sometimes critters tend to get caught in the crawlspaces. - Oh. - I heard it last night too on the other side of my wall. - It scares him. He thinks there's monsters in the attic. - You want me to have a look, sport? - You don't mind? - Oh no, I get them in my house too. How do I get up there? - I'll show you. Why don't you go and start your bath. I'll be right up, okay? Yeah, okay. - Excuse the junk. Maybe I'll get you to put all these up there one day. - I would be happy to. - Thanks. The ah, the light hasn't worked up here for forever. Uh huh. - So you'll have to use the flashlight. Okay. - Wish me luck. Good luck. - Ah. Here squirrel. Where are ya? Ah, hey, get outta here, get! Watch out, get out! Shoo! - He's out! Get outta here! - You okay? - Yeah, well, mission accomplished. - What's wrong? - The A.C.'s off. Gonna go check the breaker. Justin? - Yeah, yeah, good catch, good catch. Great, okay, bring it over here. All right, now, here's the tricky part, okay. What you wanna do is you wanna get it by the wings. - Okay. - And then you wanna take these two fingers, and you wanna pinch it right there but never very hard. There, that's all there is to it. When this was a caterpillar, it was just a bug, but now look, all those beautiful colors all blending in together like that. It's pretty amazing, huh? - Mom. - Hey, there you are. - Look what I got. - Wow, that's pretty cool. I hope it was already dead. - Mom, it's just a butterfly. - Why don't you go get cleaned up. People are gonna be here pretty soon. Okay. - Hey. Hi. Did you get my note? - I did, yeah. You know, next time I'd prefer it if you'd talk to me before you go. - Sorry, you're right. I should've asked, but I didn't wanna wake you, and he was up and. - No, it's cool. I'm glad you guys like each other so much. Did you do this? - Oh yeah, after last night, I thought I'd take a look at the A.C., but don't worry, I can put this back together in like five minutes. - You don't have to do that, you know? - It's no big deal. - What happened to the A.C.? - Ah, I don't know. The breaker keeps popping. I've had somebody check it out three times. I don't know what's going on. - Well, have Denis look at it. - Mom, Dad here yet? - Not yet. Can I open my presents? - After cake and ice cream. - Okay, you know what? We'll ride our bikes later, okay? - So did you swing a new bike? - He doesn't need a new bike. You're doing it. - Doing what? - The Terminator. It's true, every time you get any form of stability in your life, you find an excuse to sabotage it. - No, I don't. What'd he do? - Nothing. - You have a problem with intimacy. He treats you like a queen. - I know, I'm trying. There's just something. - Mm, yeah, I know it's rough. He fixes everything, except the kitchen sink. The rest of us should be so lucky. - He's reasonably good looking. You know, seems nice enough. He's got a kind of funny haircut though, and he's old, definitely old. - You're forgetting charming, attentive, and very romantic. - Well, I'm happy for you. - You're jealous. - No, I'm not jealous. Yes, you are. - I am actually happy for you, I'm serious. What's the name of your date, hmm, Bambi? - Brandy, actually. - She's not your type. - Now look who's jealous. - I'm not jealous. - You're jealous. - That was my watermelon. - You're jealous. - I'm not jealous. You're so jealous. - Cool, Coldplay. Thanks, Aunt Donna. - You're welcome, honey. - Now, I know this isn't what you asked for, kiddo. - Your Mom's pulling your leg, sport. You wait right there. Awesome! - Oh! Thank you so much! - Oh, don't thank me. It's from your mom. - You're the coolest mom ever. This is so cool. Thank you so much. Can I ride it? - Yeah, just be careful. Okay. - Have fun. - What're you doing? - Well, I, I, heard him mention it a couple of times, so I just thought that... - I can't buy the kid everything he sees on TV. I'm trying to instill some values here. - Okay, you're right, you're right. I'll ah, I'll take the bike back. - You're not gonna take the bike back now. Come on, he loves it. - I know I overstepped my boundaries here, okay, guilty. Hey, punish me. I deserve it. Don't be mad at me. Huh, come on. Come on, I hate it when you're mad at me. - When have I ever been mad at you? - This is the first time and I hate it. That's better. You did send him the invitation, right? - Mm hmm, I mailed it to him, and I left him two messages on his voicemail. Has nothing to do with you, kiddo. Tell you what, why don't you go ride your new bike around the neighborhood for awhile? I'll keep an eye out for him. Okay? Okay. - John, I don't know what's going on with you. Maybe you're uncomfortable because I have a date. I don't know, but to not show up to your own son's birthday party. You broke his heart. Hello? Look, whoever this is lose my number. - Well, you called me, it's John. What're you talking about Justin's birthday party being today? His birthday isn't till Wednesday. - Don't you play games with me, John. I sent you the invite two weeks ago. I left you two messages. It was his party today. - Well, my machine's been deleting my messages, and I didn't get an invite. Look, I don't appreciate these games, Karen. You could've called my office. - Yeah, well, you don't have the best track record, John. It's not like you haven't done this before. I didn't know about the party, Karen. - Are you lying to me? No, will you just put Justin on the phone for me? - He's um, he's riding his bike. I'll have him call you when he gets home. Great, well, that's very generous of you, bye. - You know John probably threw it out with the junk mail, or he's lying. He does that. That way he can say that you never sent it, and it's your fault. - No, I don't think he was lying. - Well, obviously it's John who's making the phone calls. You know how jealous he gets when you're dating someone else. - Yeah, no, I don't, I don't know. All the, all the calls are coming from a private number. Randy is the only one I know who's got blocked I.D. Getting three calls a day. He used to send me three emails a day, and he left three dozen roses on my doorstep. - Have you called the police? - Yeah, they say there's nothing they can do, because I can't prove it. - Well, maybe Denis can help. - Why could Denis help? - I don't know, because he's good at everything, isn't he? - Oh, careful. - You scared me. What're you doing up there? - You wanted those boxes up here. I rang the doorbell, but you must've been in the shower. - Yeah, I was. Um, don't worry about it. I'll deal with it later. - Oh, there's just a few more. - Denis. - Okay. I think you've got another squirrel up here. - It's fine, just leave it. - Sure. You've barely touched your food. What? - Denis, I think we need to slow things down a little. - What're you talking about? - I think you're great, and I've completely gotten caught up in this, but it just feels like things are moving a little too quickly. - Is this about the bike? - No, it's not about the bike. It's not really any one thing. It's just a feeling. I wanna be honest. - Ooh. - Denis, I'm not breaking up with you. I'm just saying that I wanna-- - A slowdown, I heard you. - I'm feeling a little crowded, Denis. - Well, you um, do everything you have to do to get to know a person, their likes, their dislikes, what makes them happy, and ah, you still end up looking like a fool. - Denis, come on. Come on, you're taking this the wrong way. - Oh, okay. Well, um, I understand. So ah, you take all the time you need. Would you care to see the dessert menu? - No, I think we're done here. - Hey, kiddo, Casey said you guys had a good time. - She's a cool babysitter. So, how was dinner? - It was okay. - Is Denis here? - No, I think that we're just gonna be friends for a little while. - He was gonna take me and Anthony butterfly hunting. - I know, I'll take you and Anthony butterfly hunting. - Yeah, I guess. - Goodnight, sweetie. - Goodnight, Mom. - Okay, squirrel, wherever you are, this is not a hotel. Time for you to come out. - Mom. Mom. Mom. - Oh, what time is it? - Are you okay? - I must've caught a bug or something. Are you ready for school? - Yeah. - Well, you look terrible. - Thank you. - Why don't you go home? - No, Wagner's office needs his paperwork by Friday. - So do it tomorrow. I'm serious, I'll give you a ride home. - Oh, I broke up with Denis. He's very upset. So is my son. Why can't I just have a normal relationship? - Hey, I liked him. - You know I really don't feel very well. - Come on, I'll give you a ride. We'll get Lauren to follow in your car. - Thanks. - There. I gotta drive out to Columbia, meet with Dick Speeder. You gonna be okay? - Yeah, I think so. - Okay. - Hmm, why are you so good to me? - You don't know, do you? Don't tease. - You see a smirk? Get some sleep, okay? - Hey there, sport! Hey, Denis, I thought you and my mom broke up? - Well, that's up to your mother. But hey, maybe if you sweet talk her a little bit, she'll let us look for butterflies this weekend. - Sounds good. - Let's go. - Hi, kiddo, how was school? - Good. - Hey. - Denis. What're you doing here? - I called your work. They said you were home sick, so I thought I'd bring you some comfort food. - Justin, why don't you go up and change your clothes. - Okay, see you, Denis. - Later, sport. So, what do you say you let me fix you guys some dinner? - I don't think that's a good idea. - I didn't mean to come over unannounced. I just thought that at the very least we could still be friends, right? - That's really sweet. - But? Okay, um, my gift to you. I hope you feel better, really. Whoa! - Hi. - You look better. - Yeah, actually, I'm feeling a lot better. - Cool. - You need the amended contracts. - Yeah, good, thanks. - Oh, would you like a drink or something? You wanna come in? - No, I can't, I got, I gotta go. - Okay, be right back. - All right, thanks. - Am I completely losing my mind? Did I leave the amended contracts at work? - I thought you said you worked on them yesterday from home? - I did. But they're not here. I can't find them. No one would've touched them. They're not here. Ah. - Mom, what's going on? - Go back to bed, Justin. - I can't sleep. It's too hot. - Well, there's nothing I can do about it. I'm not in the mood. Go back to bed. I know I look terrible. I just can't seem to shake this flu. I also can't find the contracts. What? What? - Mr. Wagner got that last night. They're pulling out of the deal. Somebody made some accusations against you. - What? - Sour deals with past clients. - But this is a lie. They're all lies. You know that, don't you? - Yeah, of course I know that, but you know, Wagner has a reputation for being skittish. He's been burned before. - Well, just explain it to him. - I have, Karen. He's walking, okay? - No, well, he can't. I'll call him. I'll explain it to him. Alex, this is the only thing I have right now. - Karen, I just spent the last two hours on the phone with him, okay, he's done. What the hell's going on here, Karen? Was this your ex-husband or? - I don't think so. I don't think John would do this. - Then who? Hello. Randy? Randy's not here. - Well, I need to speak to him. He's out of the country. I'm subletting his place. - Out of the country where? He's working for a contractor in the Middle East. Been there since May. Want me to leave a message? He checks in once a week. - Um, no. - Hey, so glad you called. You must be feeling better, hmm? - Did you do this? - I don't know what this is. - I spent months on this client, Denis. I am a single mother. I need that money. - No, Karen, I had, I had nothing to do with this. - You left the flowers. This note is in your handwriting. Randy's out of town. Are you surprised to hear that? Has been for months. You never mailed the invite to John. You probably figured out some way to erase his messages too. So this is your thing? This is what you do? Scare women, make them feel vulnerable, so that in some sick, twisted way all this would make me need you? - Karen, I don't know what you're talking about. That's just crazy. - If you ever step foot near my house again, I will ruin your life. Jail will be the safest place you could be. Hi, Karen. - Hi. Feeling any better? - Ah, no, not really. I, I've been having these headaches, so is it a tumor? - It's not a tumor. Good. - You do have a slight bladder infection, which is what caused some of the discomfort. - Bladder infection? Well, I've been feeling groggy and low energy. I'm never sick. - Well, it may be stress. A bladder infection can mask some of the other symptoms. - What'd you do, hunt them down with a little bow and arrow? - Chloroform in a jar. And the first time you woke up with these headaches? - Almost two weeks ago. I'd just broken off my relationship with him. And did you have this feeling of discomfort before then? - No. - And you think he's been in your bedroom on more than one occasion? - I know he has. At first I thought it was a dream, but it, he was here. - Your security system showed no unauthorized entry? - Well, I'm sure he knows his way around that. - Karen, what's going on here? - I think Denis has been breaking into the house, and I think he's been drugging me. What? Denis Teague? Yes? - I'm Detective Donnelly. I need to ask you some questions. - Regarding what? Drugged her? Oh, she completely lost it. Karen, Karen, Karen. - I need to know where you were between 10 o'clock last night and seven this morning. - I was on a business trip. I just got back this morning. - You were not in Kansas City? - No, Omaha, I've got my hotel receipts if you wanna see them, and I got gas receipts, and food receipts, and. Look, I haven't seen Karen since, since she invited me for a coffee about a week ago. - She invited you? - Karen has a history of well, paranoia when it comes to her ex-boyfriends. - Do you know any reason why she would accuse you of this? - Money. - What do you mean? - She's broke, she just lost a big client. She said it was my fault the deal fell through, because ugh, because she was spending too much time with me, you know? Made her lose her focus, whatever. - Are you in possession of chloroform, Mr. Teague? Oh, she's gonna use that against me? Okay, um, I use to collect butterflies. I haven't done it since I was a kid, and I can't remember the last time that I bought chloroform. No, I don't have any chloroform. - Would it be all right if we searched your home? - Absolutely, you can look anywhere you want. We can go there right now if you'd like. Listen, um, I know this isn't exactly, well, it's not legal, but ah, because of her past, I was concerned for myself when she invited me out for coffee. I recorded the conversation. Do you wanna hear it? Mm hmm. - Here it is. - I need that money. I will ruin your life. Jail will be the safest place you could be. He's edited what I said. That's taken out of context. - That may be, Miss Reese, and I am not dismissing your allegations, but the rest of his story checks out. He was out of town. - No, he wasn't. He's covering all his tracks. He's very clever, Detective. Somehow he's been breaking into this house. - Who is Randy Stroud? - He's a man I dated. That's who I thought sent the flowers, and who I thought was stalking me, but it was Denis. - And you can prove it was Mr. Teague who left the flowers? - Well, he wrote the note. It was his handwriting. - You don't think Randy is the one who left the flowers? - Randy is out of the country and has been for months. You figure it out. - Do you still have the note? Mm hmm. - Look, what about the chloroform? Denis collected butterflies, used chloroform. - It's one possible cause for her symptoms. We will have the tests done. Chloroform disappears from the symptoms very quickly. - I was not hallucinating! That man was in my house! - What now? - I'm gonna look into this Randy Stroud fellow. I need to question your ex-husband. - What about Denis? - We will have the handwriting sample checked, but we've searched his house. We've checked his alibis. Right now his hands are clean, I'm sorry. - Well, then I want you to check this house, all of it. - I don't see anything! There's no other access to the attic from inside the house? - No, just here. Have you changed your alarm code? - Yeah. - Well, there's really nothing more I can do here. - This is one hell of a system. - I want it replaced. - Your money, Fort Knox should be so lucky. - I want every lock changed, two bolts on every door. I'm changing all my numbers too. I know it sounds crazy. I swear to God I wanna kill him. - Well, do us a favor and don't. I don't want my kids looking at Aunt Karen through prison bars, much less, Justin. - You did have a fever the other night. Maybe, just maybe, you were hallucinating. - Lenny. - I'm just saying let's hope that's what it was. - Have you talked to him? - No, not yet. - Have you talked to John? - Ah, yeah, I talked to him. He's out of town. He's being really sweet actually. I'm just not sure he believes me. - Well, we do, both of us. - This is our new phone number, kiddo. I need you to keep it in a safe place, and don't give it out to anybody. - Mom, you already gave this to me. - No, I didn't. - You gave this to me this morning. Sorry, I've just been under a little bit of stress in case you haven't noticed. - Well, then don't make things up. - What did you say? - Nothing. - Come here. I am not making this up. Now, I know you like Denis, and I'm sorry, but he is not a good man, and I need you to understand that, okay? - Okay. - I need you to be on my side for this one, kiddo. I need an ally. - Sorry. - Still friends. Hello? Hello, Karen. - Denis, how did you get this number? I won't be made a fool of. - I own a gun. Denis, I am warning you. Stay away from me and stay away from my son. - You were right about your ex-boyfriend, Randy Stroud. He's been out of the country for three months, checks out. - Which leaves Denis. - Do you own a gun, Ms. Reese? - No. Yes, I do, but it's not mine. It's my ex-husband's. I don't actually use it. - Did you threaten Mr. Teague? - I told him to stay away from my house. I think I have that right. - You don't have the right to threaten him. - But he threatened me. He violated me. - Your tests were all negative. Your blood work showed no chloroform in your system. - But you yourself said it wouldn't stay in my system for long. Well, what about the handwriting? - Inconclusive, he's threatening a restraining order. You don't want that on your record. - Listen, I know that it is my word against his. I also know that cases like this don't usually get resolved until someone gets hurt. Denis is a dangerous man, Detective! I just hope by the time you figure that out it's not too late. Justin, put your bike in the garage and your skateboard. It's gonna rain soon. - So they won't do anything? - No, they think my anxiety over Denis induced the whole thing. I don't know what to think anymore. After I got done talking to them his story does make more sense than mine. - But fingerprints has gotta be, hair samples are in your house or something. - No, he spent way too much time here for any of that stuff to be held up in court. I swear to God, I don't know what I'll do if he shows up here again. Just tell me you believe me even if you don't. - Hey, yeah, I believe you. - Where have you been? - Gross. - Oh, shut up, bike in the garage now! - I am gonna go home very quickly and get some things, and I will be right back. - We'll be fine. - Okay. Okay. - Hey, you didn't smirk. - You should go inside. It's gonna pour. I'll be back in less than an hour. - I hate thunder. - It's just the wind. Come on, time for bed. The breaker went off again. Come on, keep going. Okay. - You know, I used to be afraid of storms too until your grandma told me exactly what thunder was. When lightning moves faster than the speed of sound. Goodnight, kiddo. Love you. - Sweet dreams. Justin, what're you doing? - I'm scared. Mom! - Justin! Justin! Justin, we have to... - You make a noise and you die. Nod if you understand. Good girl, downstairs now, go. Drive. - Where is Justin? - Close the garage door. - Where are we going? - Just drive. 9-1-1, what is your emergency? - Mom, my mom, she, she's in terrible trouble. - I showed you nothing but kindness, Karen. Gave you everything I had. I would've given you everything you ever wanted. I love you. - I love you too. Don't patronize me. You don't love me. You tried to ruin me. Tried to ruin me because you think I'm a fool. Well, I'm not a fool. - Karen! Alex. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay, I gotcha, buddy. All right, check. - Denis, where's Justin? You know he looks up to you like a father. Don't you hurt him. Don't you hurt my baby. - Justin will be fine, Karen. Like you say, he looks up to me like a father. Just like a father, hmm. Slow down, Karen. Karen, slow down. - Put the gun down, ma'am! Put it down now! Are you Karen Reese? Ma'am, your son called 9-1-1! He told the operator what happened! Ma'am, please, put the gun down now or we will shoot! I believe that an open road is a metaphor to life. Some days you can see for miles, everything is clear. Other times what's just beyond the headlights is dark and unknown. But if you keep control, if you believe in yourself, you can make it through any twists and turns no matter how it might otherwise seem. - It's all slated for the police auction. Everything he told you was a lie. We found the phone he was using to tap your line. Some blankets, a water bottle, and food we're hidden in one of the boxes. He made himself comfortable up there. These journal entries begin the 17th of June. When did you first start seeing him? - A few days after the Wagner deal, around the 22nd. So are you saying he was in my attic before then? - The entries are pretty benign, your likes, dislikes. He wanted to make sure you liked him I guess. And then it looks as if he was gathering information to try and get you back. He wrote here the first chloroform he gave you was only intended to make you sick. - So that I would need him. What about the others? - His twisted way of regaining control I guess, but then once he became a threat, he intended to kill you. We found a grave. - Oh, my God. - Would you like a copy of this? - No. - I should've listened. I talked you into him. We all did. - I don't know what to say, Karen. He had everybody fooled, sorry. - Bad people don't come with warning labels. Thank you guys for all your support. I couldn't have gone through this without both of you. I just hope he goes to jail for a long, long time. That would be poetic justice to know that his every move was being watched by somebody else for the rest of his life. - I hope he chokes on his own medicine. - Wow, it's so easy to make you guys laugh. ♪ I wanna soak you up just like you did before ♪ ♪ You're the one that opened up every door ♪ ♪ I'm on the inside line and I'm here alone now, uh ♪ ♪ Give a dog a bone ♪ ♪ I wanna hold you ♪ ♪ Just talk to me ♪ ♪ Just need me ♪ ♪ We'll be all alone now, baby ♪ ♪ You're my one desire ♪ ♪ You're my baby ♪ ♪ You're my burning fire ♪ ♪ Do you know how long I've waited for you, baby ♪ ♪ You're my baby, yeah ♪ ♪ I can't see myself with no one else, baby ♪ ♪ I can't see myself with nobody else but you ♪ ♪ I can't see myself with no one else but you ♪ ♪ I can't see myself with nobody else ♪ ♪ I wanna see you ♪
