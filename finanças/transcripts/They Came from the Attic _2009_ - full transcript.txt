I'm so sorry. Cheese! Hey, Sleepyhead. Why don't you get your mug in the picture too? You guys are lame. Yeah, come on! We haven't had a family picture for a while. Set the timer. Come on, come on! Come on, Jen. Ready? Just take the picture. Okay, come on. Here we go, ready? Say cheese! Cheese! Are we almost there? It won't be long, Sweetie. It's just at the end of this road. How long does this road go on? We've been driving forever. It's not like we're not going to be moving again. Don't start, Jen. You know what I think? I think you're going to love this place, trust me. Right. Jen, can you help me? Yeah, Mom, I got it, okay. I got it. Is he okay? Yeah. So do you think we found the right doctors this time? I hope so. Things are going to be fine, I promise. It's a little creepy, Dad. Creepy? It just needs a little work, that's all. Jen's right, it's a little creepy. Come on, you guys, see Ben? He likes it. And our stuff will be here in a couple days. Can somebody help me, please? I got it, Jen, that's the heavy one. You help your mom with the light stuff. Jen, can you just try to help out without complaining? Mom, we have had to move four times in the last two years. Coming here isn't going to help Ben. It's only moving me farther away from my boyfriend. Your boyfriend's 23 years old, and you're 17. You should be dating someone your own age. You know what, I've heard all this before, okay? Well, too bad. A little work? Hiya, Neighbor. Whoa! Geez, you almost gave me a heart attack. Hi. Sorry, didn't mean to startle you. That's okay, don't worry about it. Richard Hooper. Larry Dubie. This is my wife, Doreen. Your wife? How do you do? Lovely to meet you. And you as well. My son, Jack. He doesn't say much. My daughter, Lily. She leaves for the city next week. It's a shame, you know. Someone moves in just as I move out. We could've been good friends. This is my daughter, Jen. Jennifer, and that is my wife, Susan, and somewhere around here is my son, Ben. He's a little shy. I'm sure we'll see him around. We just wanted to welcome you to your new home. Well thank you. Listen, do you know if there's any pizza delivery places around here? We definitely won't be cooking tonight. Yeah, there is, actually. Doreen, do you have that number? Yeah. We order from there all the time. The food's really good. Are there actually stores around here? Yeah, about four or five miles down the road. Thank you very much. It's weird, finally having a new family move in, after what happened. Honey, it's none of our business. Well, we better be getting going. Good to meet you all. Nice meeting you too. See you around. Okay. Let's go, Kids. Good luck. Rick, what was that all about? I have no idea. Dubie? Nice, Dad. Can we get some pizza or something? I'm starving. Yeah, vegetarian. Let's get some pepperoni on it. Yeah, if that's what you like. I'm just hungry. Sure, do you have that number? I'll give them a call. Where are the showers in this dump? Sorry, Ladies, no water. It hasn't been hooked up yet. What? How are we supposed to clean ourselves? We can't for a couple of days. You can't be serious. Well, we already said this place needs work. Look, it's going to work out fine, Jen. Why is there still so much junk in this house? I don't know, I guess the people that lived here didn't finish taking their stuff, I guess. I know, why don't you see the rest of the house, see what else they've left behind? No, no point. We won't be here long enough. Ben, you want to play some cards? Honey, I can't remember which box I put it in. Well you can look in there, but I don't think you're going to find it. Rick, what are we going to do about Jen? What are you talking about? She's already miserable here. Don't worry about it, Hon. She'll settle in soon enough. Just give her some time and space, and everything will come together, all right? You're right. It'll all work out. What about Ben? Do you think he'll like it here? Hey, Benny's a tough little kid, you know that. He'll be fine. Would you stop worrying? Well, you married a worrywart, so... Too bad. I did, I did. Okay, let's go through those two other boxes. I need to find my razor. Come help. How are you guys doing? Yeah, how are you guys doing? Okay, let's get some of these boxes unpacked here. Okay, here we go. Here is box number one. Maybe it's in here. Okay, let's see. No, it's not here. Oh my God, I'm starving. Why didn't you just pick it up? Oh, geez! That's why, the food's here. It's only an hour late. An hour's a long time when you're waiting. Oh, yeah. Hi, come on in. Took you long enough. Sorry, no one else wanted to come to this place. Why? Wow, this place is nice. You must have got a good deal, eh? Never actually seen the inside, just heard a lot about it. Excuse me, why did you say that? Sorry, never mind, just stories. 22.50. What? The pizza, 22.50. Oh, yeah, of course. There you go, thanks. Wow, nice tip, thanks. Cheap-ass. You folks stay safe. Shit. What the fuck? I'm really good at fixing things. Do you always creep up on people like that? I'm sorry, I saw you there and I thought you might need some help. I'm good, thanks. You really shouldn't be here, it's not safe. What a fucking freak. What was she talking about? Oh, it's probably nothing. You know how all these old houses can be. They all have their little secrets. Secrets, like what? Someone died in here and we don't know about it? It's a fixer-upper, it just needs a little bit of work, that's all. You barely have time for us, let alone this house. I told you, things are going to change, you'll see. Yeah right, Dad. So is there anything I really need to know about this house? No, not that I'm aware of. Should we bring a priest? A priest? Yeah. Look, if it will make you feel any better, I'll give Larry a call in the morning to talk about the house, okay? It just needs a little bit of work, so would you please stop worrying about it? Just don't say anything to Jen. You know how she gets. Hey, I found a flashlight and a picture of some family. The light actually works. Oh, cool, can I see the picture? Hey, that must be the family Doreen was talking about. You're kidding me. Don't worry, I'll get it. You know what, I'm just going to go look for some candles. Jen, can I have that light? It's just a power cut, Daddy will fix it. Okay, everybody, looks like the power's going to be out for a while. Find any of those candles, Jen? No, I'll go look. Nice choice of house, by the way. Jen. Don't worry, Sue, let her be. Rick, don't waste them all. What, there's only a couple shots left and I just want to finish off the roll, okay? Well when you're done, just put the camera in my bag and I'll develop them later. There, finished. There was someone watching me from outside. What? I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think it was that creepy guy next door. Dad, can you go check? Jen, we're in the middle of the woods. It's probably just some animal or something. Rick, go check. Fine, I'll go and look. Flashlight? I found some scented candles and a lighter. Seems like the power goes out a lot around here. Well, I hope not. I'll go set up the sleeping bags. I haven't even seen my room yet. I know. So did you see anyone? No, but I did find this. I told you it was that freak. Okay, let's not jump to any conclusions, okay? I'll sort this out in the morning. For now let's just see if we can get a good night's sleep, okay? Okay. I'm home! Morning. Morning? It's 12:30. Get up, Sleepyhead. Five more minutes. The pictures are on the counter. Okay. Where's Dad? Work. I have to pick him up soon. Got called in. Thought things were going to change. It's only a meeting, Jen. Just trust him. When did the power come back on? I don't know. It was on when we woke up. Weird. Jen, do you know why Ben was sleeping in the bathroom last night? It's just that he won't tell me. Maybe you can get it out of him. He doesn't talk to anyone, including me. I know, and it hurts your father and I that he hasn't spoken since your brother died. I miss Todd so much. Come here. I'll talk to him for you. Everything's going to be fine, okay? I promise. Thank you. We love you so much. I know. Why else would you bring me here? Get up. I'm up. Oh hi, Jen. Do you want to come over and give me help? Thanks. What's wrong? You seem upset. I'm fine, I'm just sick of moving all the time. Well, moving isn't such a bad thing. It's not just that. My brother has this problem where he... He doesn't speak a lot and it stresses my mom out. Was he born with that problem? It was my fault. Why do you say that? I was supposed to be watching them. Watching who? Never mind. I have to go. Maybe I can help. Come sit. Fine. You want to know? My brother's dead because of me. You had another brother? Yeah, Todd. He was Ben's twin but... He ran out to the road and I couldn't stop him. You shouldn't be blaming yourself for things like that. You know, I was married before I met Larry. I was driving with my ex-husband. I skidded off the road and hit the pole. Were you okay? I was fine, but my husband was killed, and I was pregnant at the time. Did the... I lost it, three days after. I thought my life was over. I'm really sorry to hear that. Don't be. I blamed myself for so long. My baby would've been 16 now. But remember, just because they're not here doesn't mean that they're not here. Thank you. If you ever need to talk, just come over. I will. You saw them, didn't you? You need to warn your family. Ben! Ben! Benny, what are you do.. Oh, what the hell did that? Here, don't touch it. Ben, wait. Hey Ben, wait! Hey. Mom said you were sleeping in the bathroom last night. Can you tell me why? You heard who? Ben, who did you hear? Please tell me. Okay, you know what, it's fine. You don't have to. It's okay, I'm sorry. Just relax. Hey, let's go inside, okay? Okay? Come on. Let's go. Hey Guys, we're home. So did you get a chance to check out the rest of the house? Not yet. But outside we found a dead cat. That was nice. Whereabouts? Out by the big tree in the backyard. Okay, well, let me just get a chance to change my clothes and I'll go clean it up. That must have been gross. Well, guess what? What? He talked to me today. He did? What did he say? Well, he didn't actually speak, but he... He didn't speak. Jen, this is what ticks your father off. Lying. He didn't speak, but he wrote "I heard them" in the sand. "I heard them?" Heard who? I don't know, probably the Dubie Family. Was he okay? He's fine, look at him. He's fine. When's his doctor's appointment? Next week. Jen, there's something I have to talk to you about. Your father has a work function tonight and I think I'm going to have to attend. I'm sorry I forgot. I think it's probably all night, but we don't know what to do with Ben. No, don't worry about it. I'll look after him. Really? Yeah. Thanks, Sweetie. Thanks. Got to get ready. Hey. Oh, Jesus. You know, you have a real habit of startling me. Sorry Neighbor, I didn't mean to. No, don't worry about it, don't worry, it's okay. I wanted to talk to you anyway, about yesterday. Yeah, sorry about Doreen. She's never really liked this house. Really, why? Rick, get ready! Oh hi, Larry. Hi, Susan. I'll be in in a minute, Hon. Okay. Bye, Larry. Bye. You're going out tonight? Yeah, we have a work function. Anyway, you were saying? About the house? Oh yeah. Well, years ago, the family that lived here disappeared. You mean this family? Yeah, that's them. Where'd you get that? Jen found it in the house somewhere. What do you think happened to them? Nobody knows. House was searched high and low. Nothing. That was a long time ago. We're talking 10 years. Well, must get home. Take care. 10 years. Oh hey, Larry. Yeah? There was something I wanted to ask you about. Your son, Jack. I think we found him peeping in the window last night. It freaked Jen out a bit. What makes you say it was Jack? We found his inhaler. Oh, sorry. He's a little slow. I'll make sure it doesn't happen again. See you around. See you. Hey. Hey. How's the house? Shitty. Guess what? What? My parents are gone all night. I'm babysitting. Oh, really? Well, you're just going to have to wait and see. I only just got to see my room today. Yeah, had to sleep on the couch last night. Ben. Ben, I'll see them later, okay? Go play. Sorry. Do you know which one it is? Yeah, yeah, big creepy place, middle of nowhere, like an hour away, right? Yeah. All right, cool. So, what's up with her? Dudes, I'm so on for tonight. Yeah right, that's what you said about the last one. You guys are so sad. I mean really, Matt. They're not sad. They're legends. What the fuck are you doing here? You know, just chilling out, hanging around, drinking a beer. Your mommy let you out? Shut up Man. Get the fuck out of here. Hey, don't be such an asshole. Hey, Matt. I bet you get nothing. I second that. Oh yeah? All right. Let's make a little bet then. 50 bucks says I go all the way tonight. Yo, I'm getting in on this bet. Fuck. Get the fuck out of here. Hey, don't be such a dick. Seriously. 50? I was thinking 200. Whoa, Jimmy, I don't have that kind of money. Relax. It's easy money. 200. All right, you're on, Man. And hey, is your girl up in the house in Wood Creek? Big, creepy.. Shit-hole? Yeah, pretty much. I heard some family there vanished. Can we come check it out? Fuck no, Man. What did you say about this family? We got nothing else better to do. We can check it out? No, fuck off, Man, not tonight. I'm serious. How are we going to know if he did it or not? Don't worry. We're going. Hi, you see them in there. I can help, I see them too. I will save her, don't worry. They only come out at night. (Babbling) Who's there? Dad, you scared me. Don't get up. Why, is everything okay? I heard you were looking in somebody's window last night. I was.. Jack, just nothing. What have I told you about peeping? No. No, no, no, no, Dad, please, I'm sorry. I'm going to have to teach you a lesson. No, no, no. Stop... Fucking... Around... With... The... Hoopers! Why can't you be more like your sister? Get in the house. Hi Ben. What is it, Honey? Honey, I've got to get dressed. Ben, stop it. Ben. Rick? Ben, stop it. Rick? Rick! What is it, Hon? Ben was pulling me. Really? Well, maybe he wants to show you something. Do you want to show me something, Honey? It's just the attic, Ben. Did you hear something? Honey, go check it out. It was probably just a bird or something. Daddy will show you there's nothing in the attic. Won't you, Daddy? Yes, I'll check it out. Okay, back up for me, Ben. Okay, Honey, Daddy will see. So do you see anything? Nope, there's nothing up here. Like I said, it was probably just a bird or something. See, there's nothing up in the attic there, Ben. Okay? See, it's all clear. It's just a big house with lots of noises, that's all. There is nothing to worry about. The coast is clear, you can go play. I don't think we should leave him. He'll be fine, Jen's here. I know, it's just that it hurts, you know? Honey, relax. Come on, everything's going to be okay. Come and help me pick out a tie. Ben, what are you doing? Okay. Hey, Jen. Like your room? Yeah, it's all right. Where'd you find that? It was here when I got here. It's very pretty. You know, I had something like this when I was younger. I appreciate this, Honey. We'll be fine, don't worry. Well we're going to go. I love you so much. Love you too. Come on, Susan, let's go. I'm coming. Do you have the keys? Yeah, right here. Thanks. Okay, bye Jen. Bye. Bye, Honey. Just go. Thanks again. Bye, Sweetie. Bye, Honey. Rick. What? Maybe I should just stay with Ben. Ben will be fine. Now would you get your gorgeous body in the car? Let's go. Would you hold that for me, Honey? Oh yeah, no problem, Sweetie. Hello? Jen? Jen? What the hell are you doing? I'm sorry, did I scare you? No, it was just a little unexpected, that's all. So what have you got planned for tonight? Come upstairs and I'll show you. Where's your bro? Asleep. Sweet. Wait right here, I'll be right back. Where are you going? Oh, shit. What? Not again. What, this happened before? Last night. You're not afraid of the dark, are you? Who, me? Kidding me? Yeah right. Well this could always be a sign. A sign of what? Well, you know... What, sex? It's always about sex with you. No, it's never about sex with me, Jen. That's the whole point. I just want to take it slow, okay, Matt? Slow. Great, so I drove all the way out here for nothing. Thanks a lot, Jen. Nothing? You are such a dick. All right, look. I'm sorry, Babe, we don't have to have sex. But can we at least just tell people we did? Oh my God, why? What was that? Don't change the subject, Matt. Why? Well you see, me and a couple of the guys have a little bit of a bet that me and you would... You know. You are such a loser. Come on, I'll give you half. Just get out. Fine. Matt! Matt! What? I was just having a little bit of fun, Jen. I didn't think you'd mind. My parents were right. I'm just a game to you. You're so hot when you're mad. Just get out. Don't call me. Fine, nice knowing you, Jen. You're an asshole. Hello? Who the fuck's there? Trey, if that's you, I'm going to kick your ass, you little shit-rat. Come on, Guys, where the fuck are you? Aw, fuck! What the fuck is that? Get away from me! What the fuck is that? Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck. What the hell was that? What? Jen, there's something out here. I told you not to call me. Jen, just shut up and listen to me. There's something out here. Just grab Ben and meet me at the front door now. It's just probably just that freak from next door. Just do it, okay? Fuck. Come on. Where the fuck is she? Come on, Jen. Hurry the fuck up, Jen. What the fuck is that? Ben. Let's just go, Guys. Matty Boy! Shut up. Why'd you make us walk so far? So Matt didn't see your car, Dumbass. Let's just go, Guys. God. Drive out here for nothing? Such an asshole. This house is very cool. Oh, it's too dark. I want to see them fuck, Man. I can't see them. They're.. Shit. Did you see that thing? What the fuck was that? Get the fuck out of here! Hey! Hey, stop! Slow down! Oh my God, shit! Can you hear me? Who's there? I need some help here! Jimmy! Jimmy! Come with me, I'll protect you. Get the fuck away from me! Ben, close your eyes. Oh God. I'm so sorry. No, no. Oh no. Shit! Oh shit! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Come on, Doreen. Hold up. Doreen, call the police. Jen, what the hell is going on here? Who's car is that? And what's with all these beer bottles around here? Did you guys have a party or something? You know what, that's Matt's car, isn't it? I am so disappointed in you right now. You've got some explaining to do, Young Lady. Richard, she probably has a good explanation. Honey, what happened? There's something in that house. You know what, Jen, I'm really sorry that we have to keep moving around like this right now, but this is our life. You're just going to have to deal with it. You're grounded. Get into that house. And where's that pathetic boyfriend of yours? Because I'm going to kick his ass. Richard. I'm not going back in that house, Mom. You have to get us out of here. Okay, Honey. Okay. Let me just talk to your father. Richard... What? You're not going to believe that story, are you? Look at this mess. You know, we've got more problems than an empty house. Our daughter needs help, Dear. She needs to go to the doctor. She's not looking well. It's probably her messed-up boyfriend. Matt is dead. What? What do you mean he's dead? I told you there's something in the house, Mom. Give it a rest, Jen. Matt, get in here. Hello? Mom, why is Dad going in the house? Mom, you can't let Dad go in there. Mom, you got to believe me. Matt? Matt. Matt? You in here? You can't let Dad go in the house, okay? I'm not lying. I don't want to hear it. Jen's telling the truth, Mommy. Oh my God! Don't, please stop! Oh my God! Richard!
