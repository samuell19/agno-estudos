Some men are simply what I call assailants. Not that they are violent against the girl and the clinic yeast ... ... but they are drawn to professions like that is more towards the fairy tale thing. It's not just Tjostolv and me. It is simply a type of man. Norway has become so "soft" that it No place for people like us anymore. I think war is healthy. To war is a natural part of human identity. Having contradictions. And you understand that there are types other than oneself, - - and accept that this kind of man is, - then you are halfway in understanding. WELCOME TO ENTEBBE AIRPORT I exist. Tjostolv existed. And the others exist. And I believe in it as in English is called "big boys' rules". You may be willing to kill ... And then you can be at the same time ... all right. Two Norwegians questioned in Congo as their driver is found killed. Congo experiences the world's worst humanitarian crisis, says the UN. ... deadly conflict. The two from Norway are imprisoned Congo under miserable conditions. Tjostolv Moland and Joshua French ... CNDP warriors right across the border to Uganda waiting to attack - - hoping to get back Nkunda as their leader. - Thanks. - Thank you. There he was. It was a long trip. - The friend I was talking about, John. - Hi. - Did you sleep on the plane? - Not a shit. I slept enough at home. Not so much at home? It's swine flu, so we must avoid close contact. swine flu We are not so afraid of here. Yes, we are at Backpackers. It's Saturday, so much batik, dreadlocks and didgeridoo. A great Australian block whistle for people who smoke hashish. We have coverage of and on the next the days because we are going on that trip. We know what we do. Tjostolv knows what he does. He's an African anarchist. I'm just kidding. You know I come home until May 17, Then we celebrate together. - You can just forget about the children's train. - It is Tjostolv greeting. No, it's ... Yes. Why not your girlfriend me? You know that. Because you're an asshole. He controls all the battles all alone. - He's a legend down here. - Is he there? - Luc! How are you? - Okay. - Mike. - It's John. John. - Something new about Nkunda? - He's safe. Our brothers in Rwanda takes care of him. So now it's finally peace in East Congo? You know what they say. Only the dead have seen the end of the war in Congo. Then we're all here. What is the next step? You will be reconnaissance in Congo and track down funds. When Nkunda was taken we lost access to money. We have tried to get resources to continue the fight against the regime. But everything has been taken. Congo's army has stolen everything, And now we want it back. We think the funds are in Kisangani. We must confirm that. And what is it? Is it gold? Diamonds? You get the address of one in Congo. His name is Eddie. He knows where it is. Against payment. If you find the funds, we go to the next phase of the mission. Then we attack the target to take what is ours. - Are you still hiring people for that matter? - We're working on it. So settled. Nice. Excuse me. This looks good. (Whistles) Here's the payment to Eddie. $ 10,000. And this is their budget. And Eddie's address. If you are arrested and mention my name - - and the CNDP rebels, don't survive. We understand that. It is now that happens, you know. It is now happening. You are aware that this is the big, what? - You are not home in three weeks. - But I'm going home to my girlfriend. - But you are not home in three weeks. - I'll celebrate May 17th. May 17, as well. Get her number. Now we'll see. Yes, hey. It's Tjostolv Moland, Joshua French's superior. He will stay here in Africa for a while, quite a while, actually. We need it his services here. This is not it as many others as can. No other can do it like him. Our life is here. It is not in Norway. Look at the loop I have on it is so valid as red white and blue I'm just waiting mother soon get me then we should go together Drive forward. The motorcycle here. - Where are the passports? - Pass? Oh well. The sunglasses. Take them off. Remove the sunglasses. Okay. Here. Look here. It's for you. - Is this here? - It may look like that. - A motorbike. - Don't touch it! Do you know where Eddie lives? - Yeah, upstairs. - Up there? - You fit on the motorcycle. Okay? - Okay. Get away from the motorcycle. Go away. Is he in there? Eddie? - You're coming too soon. - We should come today. It doesn't work well today. - It's going terrific today. - Eddie had to leave. Where is he? How fuck is Eddie? - Do you have the money for Eddie? - We have everything we agreed on. What is wrong? Just wait here. (loud voice) What is wrong? You get Eddie's number. Do you have the money? - We have everything we agreed on. - Time to go? - Yes, a very stressful type. - Let's just go. Oh well. Thanks. At least we are going to dig down the money before we get to Kisangani. Problems with the motorcycle? You strive, I see. - Where are you from? - Is it a place we can fix it? We can fix it. - We can talk tomorrow. - Nice. I'm waiting for you. - See you tomorrow! - Yes, tomorrow. (Bell) Hello. Do you have a room? - How many? - One two. Meat cap 1 and 2. - Two persons? - Yeah. I am in full swing. It feels like the balls has become a big dick in the middle. We were to meet in Kisangani. So we'll meet you tomorrow ... Listen, Eddie. No, it wasn't the deal. We'll meet you in Kisangani tomorrow. That was the deal. He refuses to meet in the city. He's scared the intelligence. Why? Okay. Listen. We will meet you at road sign 110. Yes, on the way to Bafwasende. Waymark 110. Yes, tomorrow. Good bye. - What is the scheme now? - We meet him ... Is the intelligence behind us? The intelligence is it strongest institution in Congo, - - So maybe, but then it's better to meet him at the road mark. It's an Africa thing. We just have to do a little about the deal. It happens all the time. - Do you see anything? - No. The intelligence must sleep, too. It's not too late to turn around! - Can you fix it? - He says no. - Why not? - He's missing that part. Order a new part. - It'll take two weeks. - Two weeks? - We order right away, one week. - One week? - Then it'll take a week? - It is okay. We drop it. We need a car. - Okay? - Someone asked for you. - Who? Who asked for us? - The Immigration Office, I think. - What did they want? - They said they came back. - Okay. We need a driver. - We're going to Bafwasende. - Hey, boss. Is it okay? - Yeah. - Are you going to go? - To Bafwasende. Get a pick-up ... I can get the best car in Kisangani. No thanks. Can you call me? The best driver in Kisangani. My friend can come in a minute. I think the driver is here. If it's him, we drive in a quarter of an hour. Okay? - A moment. - Did the hotel call you? - Yeah. - $ 100 for everything, huh? - Where are you going? - Didn't the hotel say that? - Who are they? - They're going the same way. - To Bafwasende? - A little longer. They are sitting on the back. - Wait, wait. - Take care of it. I'm still here. We meet at road sign 110. We drive in a quarter of an hour. Thanks. Good bye. What? He requires $ 100 extra for the motorcycle. Of course. Soon it clicks for me. - The deal was $ 100 in total. - The motorcycle takes place. - Are you taking the motorcycle? - We agreed on $ 100. - 50. - 20. What is your name? Abedi Kasongo. - Why do we stop? - He had to call his wife. (Mobile ringtone) - Who was it? - My wife. Why do not you answer? - I'm a busy man. - A busy man? Now we are on ... ... 106. It's not that far away. Okay, stop. Stop the car. Hoi! (shot) Run, Josh. Drive! Drive! Run, fuck! Drive! Shit! (car door slings) You killed your friend, right? There were only you two in the cell. You deserve your punishment. It is important that we get clarity of questions or misunderstandings - - in conjunction with mr. Moland's death. Tell me what happened. You got drunk, one led to it others, and then you began to fight. Was that what happened? Tjostolv was accused of murder, You're just accused of complicity. Was that what you were fighting for? Was that the reason for the conflict? - No. - But Joshua ... You've lied about so much. How can I believe you? Imagine - - that your family must go to the world end to visit you in prison. Come on, my friend. Joshua, you're about to lie. It's like you have an illness. Do you have or do not have killed Moland? Joshua? Halvard Mo from Kripos. Sorry to be abrupt. - What did you say? - Halvard, I'm called. Halvard Mo. We're here to assist Congolese police. This is Ane Strøm Olsen, Specialist from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I've seen theirs forensic examination. We have formed a quite clear picture of the course of events. He had put on his shirt. The shoes. We join in on reconstruction and forensic examinations - - and make sure things are working book. We'll see you later, okay? - Ane Strøm Olsen. - Joshua. Yes ... I'll make sure you're taken care of, and helps the UD in certain matters. Why did they send you? Because I've been working with similar things before. - In Congo? - No. Not in Congo, but Middle East, North Africa, Ivory Coast. How are you? I don't really know what happened here. You could imagine to say something about it? - You've been sitting here for four years? - The time you've been trying to get me out. This has led me to accuse me for killing my best friend. That's what I'm here for to dissolve in. It's just maybe a little late? A little? As long as you are not accused of murder at Tjostolv, we believe in pardon. But the Congolese want something to show the world, and say: "Look. That's what we said. Now the latter can go. " What is it? What are they to show off? You must agree - - that Tjostolv Moland shot and killed the driver Abedi Kasongo. Stop the car! - What? - Stop the car! - What? - Stop the car! Stops. Fuck ... Luc doesn't answer. Mike ... Yes, he was shot. He was shot and killed, I do not know. - Yeah. - We have to get out of the country. We can do that. I am sending you the coordinates when we are there. What is he saying? What did he say? We go to the Epulu Park. Someone picks us up tomorrow morning. We just have to lie there and wait that someone is coming to us? There are 15 barriers before Uganda. Rumor has spread. We are two whites in a vegetable car. It doesn't look so good, is it? - Fuck. - It goes well. We are military attorneys from Norway. We are in a hurry and have no time to stand here. Open the boom. We are in a hurry. Defense Ministry. Norway! Thank you, Lieutenant. Damn. - Let's find a place to camp. - You're not quite A4. Joshua. Come on, damn it! Hello. Water? Joshua. (Bursts) No! I'm getting up. No weapons. Norwegian military. I have no weapons. Norwegian military. Stop, stop. I have no weapons. No weapons! Say they should stop shooting. I'm from the Norwegian military. Defense Ministry. Kingdom of Norway. (shot) Show me your credentials. - They say you shot their driver. - No, we haven't shot anyone. No, we haven't shot anyone. Listen. No danger. I will help you. I'm a Norwegian soldier. I work for the state. Please ... Shoot that shit! This is your host, General Kazumba. Come. Take a seat. Do you like fish, mr. French? Yes ... I like fish. Abrupt. It is important that we cooperate. Mr. Kapu and Mr. Aradjabo have been helpful - - And told us what happened to mr. Kasongo. Yes, it was the driver. The man who drove you and your friend from Kisangani. There are lots of fish in Norway, huh? Fish and oil. A very rich country. A toast. For Norway. You know what happened with my friend? We buried your friend in the bush. Why did you come here? You know it is a very dangerous place. We came for the sake of excitement. Did you find it? It is Bibiche Olendjeke. She was married to Abedi Kasongo. The man you killed. My condolences. It's a very sad day for you. And for Congo. White men have come here for several centuries. Just for the sake of pleasure. We are never allowed to to be part of the fun. Congo is actually too a very rich country. But we are looted every day, as we have always been. By USA, France, Belgium. Portugal. And now Norway? Rwanda and Norway have money for compensation. To Olendjeke. To Kepo. To Aradjabo. To me. And the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Eat. You get to enjoy the excitement, mr. French. (Groan) (Banking) Come out. Come out! - Have you been to Kisangani before? - Never. - But you've been to Congo? - No. - In Congo, spies are valuable. - I'm not a spy. Moland. You and Moland. - Moland. You and Moland. - I'm not a spy. - You're a soldier. - I'm not in the military anymore. Do you see these ID cards? They are real. For you are soldiers and works for the Norwegian military. Defense Ministry. Rank and name. Joshua French. Expiration date:January 8, 2016. - 2016! - Sit down. - We shut up completely. - English! - Do you know that man? - Yeah. Joseph Kabila Kabange. He is the country's leader. Rwanda's government killed his father. He wants you to work for those who killed him? - Norway gets us home ... - Hi! What do you say to him? I'm just saying that Norway gets us home. They use the ID cards as evidence that we are spies. Water. Sango. Hello. Sorry for yesterday. I didn't sleep so much. I'm more on today. In Congo, they are quite sensitive when they see one not showing them respect. Then they are offended. It is very Congolese to be. It is an imposed feeling. Then you have to do everything to off-offend them. - Yes, they want money. - They will always. And it does not give the UD in such cases. It was clear. Norway is different to such cases than other countries. - They have reacted completely abnormally. - How? Statistically speaking, foreigners sit sentenced in Congo for a maximum of two years. Had I been a Belgian, I would have been out after 12 hours. I know that. Because they know they can't always follow the book in Africa. Belgium is not exactly right the best story in Congo. It is an important principle for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to respect the rule of law. - Although two from Norway zones here. - Why do you think I'm sitting here? Because Tjostolv Moland and you are convicted of murder - - and participation in murder at Abedi Kasongo. And I'm here because he was found dead on the cell with you. Norway can't pay you out. - Do you think I'm guilty? - So Congo needs something else. Tjostolv did not kill Abedi Kasongo. I don't want to lie to ... We will not have to - offend Congo because you do not show respect. I ... You can be sentenced for two murders. Then there is little we can do. You might think that this has been Rambo 1 and 2, - - where we went bananas a kind of killing stick through Africa. I'm interested in Africa. Tjostolv loved Africa. I'm interested in history. We were interested in security. We were professional soldiers. We are unable to settle down in Norway with a habit There must be room for us too. Somewhere. I've run motocross and that, but it is Africa that draws. Can't we even go adventure? Is the adventures of the end of the end? It must be allowed to take chances and cross eastern Congo, because it's cool. For us it was cool. Although it's really clown-like. But that's me, and he was like that. - Were you just two tourists on tour? - I never used the word tourist. I'm done with Joshua. Moland invites you to Africa. He recruits you. He writes to rebel leader Nkunda, who are charged with war crimes. He contacts groups that will overturn the government of the country you are traveling in. And he'll get you mission in Congo. I respect you not manages to get into the cases ... Where would you be now if you had not met Tjostolv? Do you think you were sitting here? Today, Joshua, we become legends. Peace in the room! Guard, give attention! Rest. Revered right. The defendants are asked to get up. I will make the following statement. Unfortunately, I consider this trial as a political farce. And I just want to participate physically in this trial from now on. Mr. Moland considers the trial as a political farce. (anxiety in the hall) Silent! Out with you. Out! Out! (shot) For the murder of Abedi Kasongo - - Tjostolv Moland is judged to five times the death penalty. Joshua French is sentenced to death for murder, - - to have formed a criminal organization - - and for possession of a military weapon. (angry call) Peace in the room! Moland and French feel guilty in espionage for the Norwegian state - - and the king of Norway. The Norwegian state sentenced to pay - - $ 500 billion in compensation to the Republic of Congo. (people clapping) Hr.? - Where are the guards? - There are no guards here, my friend. They are on the outside. No keys here, no rules. There are former soldiers from the army. The Congolese military. Over there are the former rebels. CNDP, MRC, RK ... anything. Some of them don't even know who they fought for. But you ... you are the spies. There is only one rule in here: no policy. Never mention names. Never swear some fidelity. Stay neutral. (dunk - door opens) - Hi! - Neglect! We get to sleep in shifts. You take the first guard. Okay. - Get a cigarette. - No. Give me one. If I give you a cigarette, You give me two back. Okay. How old are you? 15. - Are you a soldier? - Maybe. I am also. In the forest they train us. They say, "You must kill that guy." Then you have to do it. Cut off your heads ... and your hands. Have you killed anyone? What happened to your hand? Get to see. You must keep the wound clean. (Gasping) Keep it quiet. Mike. Tjostolv. I have to show you something. - Where do you want to go when we get out? - As far from Congo as possible. I will not return to Norway. Maybe I'm going straight to Jamila. But Uganda will hardly accept me, so we have to meet in Kenya or something. I can't go home to Norway. Be celebrity and go celebrity parties. Be kind Rune Rudberg on a bad day. I don't want to. I can go back for Wildlife Conservation. Take care of wild animals, - - hunting snipers and get closer to the legends. Yes, maybe that's my call. I stay there, And there I can be the rest of my life. Stop! Hi! Get away with you! What do you want? Go to hell. Stop! What happened? Ask how long he has had it. - Why hasn't he cleaned it? - He's stupid. Do you get the ointment, Tjostolv? Mike? There are many at home who are happy in such African ... ... chorus, but they are happy who has never been to Africa. - Just put it down. Done. - Thanks. Hello. Do you hurt anywhere? You don't have pain? Do you have hurt? Yes or no? Do you hurt? Okay, so go ahead. He's not sick. Stitching. Next in line. - Hi - Hi. - Joshua. - Furuholmen. - I'm appointed to their lawyer. - Yes I saw that. Tjostolv? Visit. - Hi. - Hi. I'm a little dirty. Furuholmen, lawyer. That applies to the appeal case. Great. We work hard on all fronts. The UD does what we can, - - But this letter does matter harder for us politically. It was found on Tjostolvs PC. Have you written the letter? Which is it? A tribute to the warlord Nkunda, where you offer him their service. - I haven't written that letter. - It has Tjostolv, on their behalf. "Give me an order, and I will be your faithful servant. " It's a fake. They do that. It's just about money. - This is extremely complicated. - It's very simple. Just pay. So it's called "bid" and "bot", and it is called "ubuntu". And in Africa it's like that when you have paid ubuntu, then it is over. Then I can go to church with the widow and play with the kids and such. And that's okay, for this is Africa, not Norway. Things are completely different here. You don't understand that at home, but ... it's okay. It's pretty far from okay right now. The forensic report about mr. Moland's death is over now. Both Norwegian and Congolese the authorities have approved it. We totally agree on the conclusion. There is no reason to believe - - that there was some criminal action behind mr. Moland's death. It's very good news. You understand it, right? I know you've been through this many times - - And thought you were going home. But this is different. We have never been as close as now. You have And you must take it. See you tomorrow. You know what we call these little fuckers here? Dark soldiers. They fuck the dead and make small devil boys. They want to take power in the world. - Why are you here? - Same as you. Because it was committed a crime. And here can't be a crime be a crime - - without a criminal. Some decided the stability of the regime - - was more important than to find the truth. That's the same thing I did. The system decided that I did. - For the dark soldiers. Toast. - Merry Christmas. Mike! Tjostolv? (mumbling in sleep) You know in the Bible ... Paul became blind, so he could see. Right? We should have had two. We should have had two what? Two motorcycles. - What are you giving him? - Chloroquine. - What disease? - I think he has malaria. Cerebral Malaria. - Why not quinine? - Quinine is not good for him. Okay, relax. - I have to give a double dose. - No ... - Why do you have to ...? - No more. No! What is a remedy? That's not what you say. - It's chlorokine. - It is not. What is it? Relax, brother. There you go. - Are you treated okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. But Tjostolv has got it they call medical treatment, - - So it is a slightly different story. I've been to Bogstadveien. You didn't behave so well during the first trial. But it was not a trial. No, but it's important to act neatly. Important to be respectful in the courtroom, right? Are we agreed not to behave as bajases in court this time? - Yes it's okay. - Do we agree? Yes ... We're gonna try to get you out, huh? See you tomorrow. Get some sleep. I don't want to to say so much today. You don't have to say anything. Don't talk to the boys, thank you. Silent! Revered right. We were on our way to Bafwasende. There we found Mr. Abedi ... My jacket. Can you get him to to give me my jacket? - Sit down. - I need my jacket. - Where's my jacket? - Respect the court! Can you give me my jacket? Yes. Give me my jacket. - Sit down. - I'll wear my jacket. Am I wrong? Am I wrong? Is it me who fails anyone now? Calm down. I'm never wrong! Should he be killed, so I'm always wrong, - And then there is none who dare look at me in this hell! Come on! If you do not calm down, I'm throwing you out. I'm finished. Furuholmen, you are always right. My client is unstable at the moment. - So the experts and the doctors can investigate Moland. Mr. Moland is obviously an excellent actor. In addition to being an experienced criminal. I need no explanation. Everything is ready here. It's probably clear to you too. "We want to offer you ours service and our support, general. We can train, lead and motivate the soldiers - - to carry out operations at a high military level. Give me an order, and I will be your faithful servant. " (anxiety in the hall) Honorable judge. Tribunal. Mr. Moland is in a state where he is not sane. - This is an assault on him. - I didn't kill Abedi Kasongo. But I regretted the family that he came in that situation. The Congolese army attacked us in an ambush. In that ambush became a civilian, Abedi Kasongo, killed. And since the Congo army is too cowardly to take responsibility for his death, - I take responsibility, for I'm dead everything! I didn't say I'm working for him. I support his case ideologically. And I mean he's the right man to lead this country. Are you trying to get us killed? Is that what you want? Would you like to kill me? So kill me! Come on! Do you think we're pardoned now? When you can't shut up ?! You're sick! Come on! Run! Welcome to Ndolo. Come on! Stay lying. Mike! Mike! Lie down! So you are Laurent Nkunda's servants. This is Congo. Am I wrong? - Are you going away and greeting? - No. Hello. Hello. I want to greet lots from Hannah and everyone in Norway. - It is nice. - People think of you. I was here yesterday, but they refused to let me in, - So the cake I bought is from yesterday. I do not know ...? Maybe we just got it down in the bag for so long. Yes. - How are you? - We're fine. We are relatively good, I want to say. I need to take a look at you. It's been so long ago. Tjostolv really should come out and say hello, - But he feels Not quite on top. - He looks so bad. - Yes, he doesn't sleep so well. - Are you sleeping? - A little worse sleeping in Congo. We must pray for Tjostolv as well. Do you do that? If I directly pray for him? No ... not directly. - But it's never too late. - We ask, Mother ... We'll ask. I met the British Consul. - How did you feel ...? - I had a good feeling. So things happen. I've planned some down here - - and kept in touch with Norway. So there's a lot to do. But that's what keeps me in turn. It is important. We can sit in the visitor area, I thought. - I go in with things. - Yes, put them in the fridge. Where's the cake I got from Mom? Mike? Where's the cake I got from mother? Can you follow? Where's the cake I got from Mom? Then listen! Hi! Relax! End, then! What is this here for something? I do not know what is happening to me. I do not get it. Sango. - What are you doing? - It's just a little food. - Do you have an ok relationship with your mother? - Yeah. You moved from her when you was small and came in foster home? It is completely unnatural. - How? - I was a little restless as a child. So Mother arranged it so I got to stay with another family. On a farm. Oh yes. How long did you stay there? From I was nine until I was about 20. Okay. So you haven't lived Something special about your mother. You can try to make a kind of psychoanalysis - - why I've been who I am. That something ... something from the outside would affect me to - - to be something other than what I am personal. I do not believe that. Here is a letter that says it that you acknowledge the judgment. I thought I'd get it a signature by you today. You don't understand who I am. And you know nothing about Tjostolv and me. Mike? - Mike, end, then. - No one dares to look at me. No one dares to look at me. No one dares to look at me. No one dares to look at me. - Calm down. - No. We need something calming against the malaria. Medicine that makes him sleep. It is important that he gets to sleep otherwise I will not sleep. Are you sure our doctors have the same high standard as Norwegian? - Will they give you the right medicine? - I'm sure. We take him with a place that takes take good care of him as you asked. - He just needs some medicine. - He certainly needs some good care. He doesn't have to go anywhere. We just need something calming. - So he'll sleep. - Tinto! But I want to be here. If you come outside, and get a chance ... Then you should take that chance. Okay, Mike? Are you with Mike? Mike? There is a chance, maybe the only one you get, - So why be ready. Mr. Moland? I'm trying to help you. You get it fine there. They take good care of you. Okay. Let's go. Thanks. There were completely different smells out there. And the light was completely different. It was ... It was very strange. Suddenly I saw that the car door was not locked. Then I understand that I sit in a car - - where the door is unlocked, and there is a bus 30 meters away. I don't have handcuffs at one time. The road is completely clear. I ... I'm kind of in that bus. And it just goes down to the pier. I can go on a boat and just drive over to Brazzaville. Then I had been free. But you are not. No. - Meat hood 2. - Meat hood 1. Have you ever thought of ...? If you were alone? What? Hadn't it been for me, then you would have been home in Norway. You would be together with dama di, and ... After a month had you forgotten the whole of Congo, - the whole prison and the whole cell. You're just convicted of complicity, right? You say that you were assaulted in the jungle. - Of whom then? - By the military. Two tourists, attacked by the military at a deserted place in Congo? Because ...? - What happened? - I told you. When you can't say why you were in Congo - - You can't say the truth about the murder. The UD hears the stories you give journalists, family, friends. The story you have landed on, Joshua, don't go up. All right. The car stops on the right side of road. Tjostolv goes here. You go here. Suddenly a shot comes from the forest, intended for you. You go behind the car and you shoot. Tjostolv with shotgun, you with gun. - There was no gun there. - You had a 9 mm in Uganda. And don't tell me that you don't bring that gun - - when you know you're going to the Congo. Then you both jump up on the plane. But then you discover that car not running, so you run back. - Against that shot comes from. - Because nothing happens. - I notice that in a second. - That there is no more shot? - Everything happens in seconds. - And therefore it does not go up. Even my daughter knows you don't run where someone shoots. They fire a shot at you. It bounces on you, going through window and Abedi Kasongo's head. Out the passenger side and disappear into the jungle. - And you think one shot ... - They shot scarecrows in the air. - But one shot is aimed at you. - Maybe they shot more at me. If it was like that that Tjostolv shot the driver - ... unclear, maybe deadly ... I can understand that you can act on impulse. Me too can tell several versions. Let's say we were overpowered, for we were. Tjostolv says "run!" to the driver, but he does not move. So Tjostolv shoots him. I'm tearing get him out of the car and then we drive. But Tjostolv didn't shoot the driver, And neither did I. If it is cluttered and unsafe out there? To get out of there in such a situation? I could shoot in that situation. You could shoot in that situation. - So now I shot the driver? - No. But I don't have a hard time to understand that you could have done so. What happens, Joshua ... When you don't say the truth, We must make our truth. It happens when people lie. The most plausible version - - You're convicted. I beg you acknowledge. It can get you home. I can not. Had we done that, I hadn't told you that. But the driver was there on the trip up there. And he was really in the intelligence. He probably knew what would happen. So he got killed. It was an indirect way not to say anything. An indirect way not to say anything? You have to remember I'm an assailant. Yes, I am. I have had sharp assignments as a mercenary in Africa, more. I'm a real assailant and that I'm proud to have been down here. Tjostolv was a prosecutor who did not is negative. Soldiers are rapists. Me and Tjostolv were mercenaries. We're not shooting an innocent civilian. But you say that Kasongo was in the intelligence. It was he, most likely. (singing) Mike? Tjostolv? Tjostolv! Shit. Mike! Tjostolv! Mike! Mike! Okay. Help me help you. Give me something, anything. Soon it's too late. The Tribunal has decided to prosecute Joshua for murder on mr. Moland. Don't you agree with us that there were no signs of violence? You haven't given us Anything, nothing. Now the court must decide. Mr. French. As you can see he seems calm and relaxed. But in reality He is a very dangerous man. If you met him in a civilian environment, on the beach ... ... he would have been ready to open fire. For him it is pure child food to kill. In this country, too, we have promises. This is not Norway. It's Congo. It is my firm belief - - that you should spend the rest of life in captivity. You should get a lesson for life. It must be taken into account to mitigating circumstances? The majority of the votes say yes. Is the defendant guilty of murder? The majority of the votes by secret ballot shows - - the answer is yes. Consequently, the court judges Joshua French - - for life imprisonment for the murder of Tjostolv Moland. You ask me to change it I believe in moral. While your self of moral Reasons don't do what it takes. UD knows they could buy us out a long time ago. I've been afraid to change me here. I have it. There are few who are pure in heart, who has an innocent mind. There is almost no one there. I can seem clinical, hard and square, slightly intellectual ... But actually I want to be more Like you, a little like Chesterfield. I tell you about the building blocks for my personality. I'm really a boy from the country. With a lot of talent, clever, ordinary handsome, with good confidence, - - who is dutiful, enthusiastic ... and grain farmer. Who is ready for the military and knows what he should do, and "yes, boss". And know how to dig a ditch. That boy I am. Then I see that the world is more advanced. There are adult men, and men are strong, and cynical men and ... But I'm really innocent, completely clean. And I've been scared that it should change in me here. Am I wrong? Tjostolv did it. You shouldn't have run off. I don't miss everyone the challenges we had, - All the psychic and practical and social. Here in prison, not in life. But I miss our friendship. I miss your knowledge, all the experiences and plans. What is, Tjostolv, is that you were out. In life, as a human being. And that's not fair that it was your heritage. Or that you were made thus. I know that have bothered you ... much. But you weren't like that, Tjostolv. You weren't like that. And you weren't a killer. You were a "killer". You were not a killer. There are two different things. We didn't know enough about Africa. We were not amateurs. We just didn't know enough. Come now. Not. Stop fucking. Then someone comes. So, see you now. Like that. - Where did you get that water from? - I've been drinking it, you saw. Subtitles:Google Translate from Tron Furu Scandinavian Text Service 2018
