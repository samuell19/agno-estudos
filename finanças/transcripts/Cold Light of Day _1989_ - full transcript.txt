Mr. March, this is Detective Chief Inspector Jay. Open the door, please. Mr. Jorden March of 23 Langley Gardens? Yes. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do say can and will... I've been cautioned. There's no need to continue. ...can and will be taken down and used in evidence. I know my rights. Please. Alright. You say you've been cautioned. Do you need any representation? No. Sign this, please. No, thank you. - Do you want any tea? - Yes, thank you. Two cups of tea, please, Jones. Sugar? That's two without, then. What are you waiting for, Jones? You can get the tea, can't you? - Yes, but I can't leave... - Tea, Jones, now. Yes, sir. - You're a civil servant? - That's right, yes. - What department? - Unemployment. I worked in a Jobcenter. Would you say your job brought you into contact with a lot of young people? - What are you implying? - I'm not implying anything. Merely asking a direct question. Well, yes, seeing as how 90% of the unemployed these days are between the ages of 16 and 21, you could say that my job brought me into contact with a lot of young people, yes. Shall we begin? Yes. Yes, please? Can I have half a lager, please? Sure. - How much is that? - Fifty pence, please. Cost me a grand, anyway. He saw you coming. Yeah, I know. Well, it's more than I've ever paid. Yeah. It doesn't bother me. It's still quite a lot of money to repair an old banger. And I could've got you the part. Want a light? Yeah, cool. Thanks. Sorry, do you want a cigarette? That's alright, it's your last one. No, no, go on. It's alright. Alright. You from around here? Not originally. I'm sort of a... I am now, though. Listen, I... I'm Joe, by the way. Pleased to meet you, Joe. Jorden. Jorden March. - Which way is it? - Shh! Fucking hell. It's okay, it's okay. - Yo! - Shh! Otherwise I'll have Miss Busybody marching up here. Any minute now, she's gonna burst through that door, all 16 stones of her in her flimsy see-through nightie. Hey, who's this Miss Busybody? Is she your landlady or something? No, just another tenant. Nurse, I think. Lives downstairs. Hey, can I use your bog? - It's through there. - Ta. Can I use the flush? Or will that bring the fat nurse charging up the stairs? Be my guest. But I'm a coward. I shall blame you entirely. Can you handle 16 stones... - ...of wobbly nurse? Reckless creature. That's me. What do you do? I'm one of life's no-hopers. No, actually, I was an art student. - Was? - Yeah, was. I didn't fit in. Trouble is, I don't fit in anywhere. So you're a rebel as well as reckless, eh? You sound... totally... without redemption, dear boy. Oh, very funny. What are you, a headmaster or something? Ha-ha-ha-ha! Well, come on. Don't keep us in suspense. What do you do? Now, there's a question: what do you do? Have you ever thought how profound that question really is? What do you do? Christ! All I asked you was what you did. Besides, you started it. So, you know, just cut the crap. I'm a civil servant. I fill in lots... of monotonous gray forms. Stamp them with a little date stamp. Then I fill out more monotonous forms. Gray? No, I fill out green ones too. All that shit, just for a civil servant. I thought that, at the very least, you might be a bullfighter or something. No. I'm tired. Yeah, let's get some sleep. It's late. By that I mean... ...too late for you to... get back home, isn't it? Yeah. Mr. Green? Are you alright? I had a little accident. Old soldier. It's nothing. Come on, get you out of those. Chin in, head back. Thumbs on the singing pajamas. And we'll sort you out. Where do you keep your clean pajamas? - In the bedroom. - Right. Who does your washing these days? - Blimey. - I do. Well, we'll sort that out as well. Right, and your vest. That can soak as well. That's it. Here you are. That's better now, eh? I didn't mean to. It was an accident. It's nothing, okay? It's nothing. We'll get you a cup of tea. - There you are. - Thank you. I feel so ashamed to see myself like a stupid little baby. I didn't think I would get to that. I'm sorry. Think nothing of it, okay? Think nothing of it, please. - Is this yours? - Yes. - That's not you, is it? Blimey. Thank you. Sorry to bother you. It's about Mr. Green. I'll come back some other time, if you like, when it's more convenient. I can see you've been working late. No. No, that's okay. It's self-induced. What about Mr. Green? Well, he's just not coping very well. I wonder if you can organize some meals and cleaning and stuff. Yeah, look, leave it to me. I'll sort something out. Okay, thanks. Oh! Damn it. Good morning! Oh, what's good about it? Just a bit worse for wear? I anticipated that. Drink this. Think of everything, don't you? I aim to please. Joe, I don't mean to speak out of turn, but, um... have you anywhere to stay? What I mean is, you can stay here just as long as you need to, really. Do you mean that? You sure? Okay, then, yeah. Just until I get myself a job, you know, get on my feet. Alright, then, that's settled. You want some food? No, thanks. Oh... I'm gonna have a bath. - Surely. Help yourself. - Oh. Get us a box of matches. I need a light. Box of matches, please. There you go, love. Why are you looking at him? - Who? - You know who I mean. Do I? Oh, fuck it. I can't be bothered with you. Well, you're living in my flat. Oh, we're back to that one, are we? I can leave if you want me to. Is that what you want? Is it? No. Light it, then. I don't know why the hell you come down here. I like it. You mean it's cheap? What are you doing today? I don't know yet. I'll think of something. Well, we can meet up after... after work. I don't know what I'm doing yet. Maybe, yeah. Well... I have to be going. I can't be late. See you later then. Are you waiting for something? I thought you had to get to work. Well, one of us has got to. Have fun at the office. Kiss me. Sir! Oh, good evening, Miss Stay. You dirty old bugger. You'll give yourself a heart attack. Go on, I'll get your dinner for you. Alright? Give us a drag of that. You know that Julie Stay? I'm sure she's the nosiest person I've ever met. She's down there again in her doorway, waiting for you. I reckon she fancies you. Yeah, you've got a vivid imagination. No, I haven't. I just think she sees you as definite husband material. Well, you're just right, aren't you? You're respectable. I'm too young, of course. Ha. Poor old Albert. One look at them heaving tits and he's away. You shouldn't make fun of her. She's probably lonely. I don't care. Anyway, have you told her about us? No, I have not. I've told her you're my nephew. Well, Uncle Jorden, we're going out to celebrate tonight. I've got myself a job. You never told me about any interview. Well, aren't you going to congratulate me? Congratulations. Oh, listen, I told Albert I'd take his dinner down. No, I'll do it. You might as well get ready. Okay. - And feel free to wear my top! - Yeah, okay. Oh, Mr. March, I'm glad I've caught you. I want to ask you a little favor. I've got to go away for a couple of weeks. Nowhere special. To my mother. She's had a stroke, bless her. - Oh, dear. - Nothing major. But she's coming out of hospital on Friday and I wondered, would you look after my cat? She's no trouble. Would you? Just for a couple of weeks? - Alright. Friday, is it? - Thank you. Just bring her up before you're ready to go. You're ever so kind. Okay, I've just got to take this to Albert. Oops. Wondered where you'd got to. Listen, I've changed my mind. I'd rather we didn't go out tonight. I'm just not up to it. Oh, come on, you old man. I don't feel like it. I thought you'd be pleased for me. I am pleased for you. Yeah, well, you don't sound it, do you? Yeah, well, I don't see your hand going in your pocket! How the fuck can I? I just got a fucking job today, didn't I? Oh, Christ. Is this what it all boils down to? Money? You like me being dependent on you, do you? Helps you get a hard-on, does it? - You ungrateful bitch. - "You ungrateful bitch"! God, you sound so fucking camp, you do. I'm sorry. I just don't want you to go. Oh, it doesn't change anything. - Where are you going? - Out! Listen, I want to know where you've been all day. Oh, fucking hell! What is it with you? I'm going out because I'm bored. Don't think I don't know what's going on. Coming in smelling like a tart. Who was it this time, or don't you care? No, I don't give a fuck. In fact, the more the merrier. You make me sick. Really? Really! And don't expect to find me here when you get back! I suspect that you went out with the intention of seducing those boys to entice them back to your flat, whereupon you went about systematically and brutally murdering them. - No! - You didn't murder them? I didn't mean to. You didn't mean to? You bastard! Are you telling me it was an accident? Well, I didn't go out to murder them. It just happened. It just happened? How can it just happen? Did it give you a thrill? Why are you doing this to me? I'm telling you everything. I'm telling you the truth. I'm doing this because I want you to hurt. Do you understand? I want you to know what it feels like to have the shit squeezed out of you! Did they do that? Did they? Did they urinate? Did they mess themselves? Hm? Pervert! Did they? Yes. Yes. And you seem such a clean lad. What did you do with them? Did you eat them, covered in their own shit? No, I bed-washed them. Did you play with them? When you washed their bodies, did you screw them? Hm? Did you fuck their bodies? No. They were too beautiful for mere crude sex. Do you have a problem with sex? - Leave me alone, will you? - No. I want to know why! I don't know! I don't know! I don't know! - Who's that? - It's me, Julie! I've brought the cat. Where've you been, you little runt? I want my granddad. 'Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.' See, there's your grandfather. Sleeping. You see that? See that line through it, you see? Well, that is formed from an animal. You can see another one there, look. Look for another. See how far you can throw them. 'Kyrie eleison. 'Christe eleison. 'Kyrie eleison.' Might as well be warm. Why don't you take off your coat, then? Come on. There now. Just to get you started, lover. Oh! There now. Just to get you started, lover. Oh! Do you want any company? No, thanks. Couldn't spare us the price of a cup of coffee, could you? It's coffee these days, is it? Used to be a cup of tea. Gone upmarket, have we? Here, take it out of that and keep the change. Ta. Coffee, please. Haven't you got anywhere to go? No. Christ! Here. You got any smokes? I just gave you ten quid. Bloody hell. Got a light? Listen, mate, I ain't got anywhere to stay. You haven't got any more money, have you? What do you think I am, the Bank of England? That's it. I can't stay at your place, can I? I've got nowhere else to go. I've got no room. I don't mind. I'll stay on the floor. The flat's upstairs. Thanks for letting us stay. Most blokes want something for it. Know what I mean? Make yourself at home! Did you know what you were doing? Yes. 'Could you have stopped yourself?' Yes. Why didn't you? It was easy. I'd gone too far. Did you at any point try and stop yourself? No. How do you feel about that? Want some more tea? No, I'd like a glass of water, please. Alright, then. No, sit down. I'll go. Is Jay in yet? Okay, give me a ring when he arrives. I'll be in room six. Could you send someone in to relieve Jones for a while? And get them to bring in a drink of water for Mr. March. 'Kyrie eleison. 'Christe eleison. Kyrie eleison.' There's your grandfather. Sleeping. Might as well be warm. Just to get you started, lover. Wait! You bastard! Oh! Fuck off. Fucking thing. It's gonna be alright, you know? It's gonna be alright. Yeah. It's gonna be alright. Joe! Joe! Oh! It's gonna be alright. Hello, Colin? Colin? Jorden here. I can't get in today. Yeah. No, nothing serious. Touch of the flu. Okay, speak to you later. Thanks. Bye. Oh, hello. Looking for me? Yeah, I got back late last night. Thought I'd catch you before you went to work. - How's your mother? - She's okay. Bit confused. But she's alright. My sister's staying up there. Oh, good. Shall I bring your cat down for you? No, that's alright. I'll come and fetch her now. Walk up the stairs'll do me good. Shed a few pounds. Hope you don't mind waiting outside for a minute. Place is such a mess. Feel so ashamed. You should see mine. I can give you a hand clearing up. I mean, it's the least I can do. No, it's alright really. Thanks. I'll be okay. I've never known anyone refuse help with their housework before. You're not the type, are you, that cleans up before the cleaning lady comes? Guilty, I'm afraid. Won't be a moment. Thanks for looking after Floss. She hasn't been any trouble, has she? No, no, no trouble at all, really. Won't be a moment. Fucking animal. Did you enter the body at any time? No. Liar! No. How many more times? I didn't! I didn't! Oh! Sorry to bother you again. I forgot to tell you. I've arranged for some help for Albert. So, you won't have to worry. Well, that's good. I'll let you get on. Thanks. That's alright. I've no feeling at all. It was just a job that had to be done. A practical thing. Didn't you feel anything? For killing, yes. That's unforgettable. But for what I had to do afterwards, well, they were dead. It was messy and uncomfortable but didn't mean a thing. They're gone, you see. What about the rights of the families? Didn't they count? Well, yeah, it's sad, but they were homeless. What kind of fine life is that? And you think that justifies what you did, you disgusting man? What gives you the right to go round killing people and using their bodies for your own needs? Tell me. When did their bodies become unusable? When they began to smell? That's disgusting. You're disgusting! Well, I didn't enjoy it anyway. No? I suggest you did. Otherwise why would you continue killing? Am I right? Did they make you feel horny? Are you getting wet now, thinking about it? Well, are you? Stop it! Just let me tell. I need to know why. You alright? You alright? Hey, listen... there's a caff round the corner. Do you think you can make it there? Yeah? Come on. Can you make it? What's your name? I'll do that. There. You alright now? It's Stephen. My name's Stephen. Stephen, listen, I want to help you. Have you any friends or family I can contact? Are you alone? Stephen! What's yours? Sorry? Your name. What's your name? Doesn't matter about that. Have you got any family or friends? I'm alright now. The shakes don't stay long. Yeah, but you can't walk around like that. Have you got any money? Listen, I can help you. You can come with me. I need to see someone first. A friend. He's waiting for me. No, I think we can... we can leave now, can't we? You come with me. Yeah? Cheers. Did you enjoy killing? Well, yes. You could probably say I did. You won't be happy until you've got a reason, will you? Well? Enjoying it? That's reason enough. That's what you all want me to say, isn't it? No. Are you gonna tell me the truth? The truth? Would you recognize the truth? How the hell do I know what made me kill? I don't know. How many more words? How many statements do you need? I'm telling you, the more I talk about this, the less I know. It's driving me crazy. So you're pleading insanity, are you, March? You're the sanest man I've ever met. Am I? Well, I'm past caring now. Stephen? You alright? Are you alright, Stephen? Oh, blimey. You alright? Can you manage some food? I'll cook you an omelet. Would you like that? - Yeah, yeah, an omelet. - Right. You awake? Oh, no. Oh... A-ha. Oh. Oh, Stephen. Not again. Oh, shit! That's all I need! Bloody toilet blocked again. Hello. I wonder if you can help me. Um... something seems to be blocking the drains. It's causing flooding. Right, this afternoon. That's fine. Er right, 23... Langley... Gardens. Yeah, that's right. Great. Thanks very much. Bye. Sorry to wake you. There seems to be a problem with the drain. A blockage or something. Anyway, someone's coming to look at it this afternoon, so would you mind not using the flush till then? I know it's an inconvenience. Oh, that's OK. No... no problem. Thanks. See you later, then. Shit! If you're chucking that chicken out, Jorden, I'll have it for my cat. No, um... it's off. Fridge has broken down. Threw most of last week's shopping away. I'm going to try and do something about that drain. Fix it myself. OK. I'm off to work. I'll see you when I get back. I don't think it's me you want, love. I think it's the police. What do you mean? There's something smells like it died down there. Oh...! You can stay here as long as you need to. Doesn't change anything. And don't expect to find me here when you come back! It's gonna be alright. See, there's your grandfather. Sleeping. 'Kyrie eleison. 'Christe eleison. 'Requiem aeternam dona eis, 'Domine.' I may not have been in the business long, but I know what shit smells like. Mr March? This is Detective Chief Inspector Jay. Open the door, please. I did it for me. Purely selfishly. I worshiped the act of death. Over and over. It was like killing myself. It's as simple as that. I hated the decay and dissection. There's no pleasure in that. But I did enjoy the act. But to kill myself... I'd experience it just once. By killing others, it allowed me to feel it again... ...and again. Are you sorry for what you did? Yes. Deeply.
