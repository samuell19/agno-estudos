None of you took pains to find out She is a woman Where is she? How is she? Is she alive? Whom is she with? If we telecast her story, it will create a lot of interest amidst our viewers Truth will be uncovered Even though I'm a senior reporter I'd like to know if this is a good story You have to decide But if you think it's just my personal wish, we can drop it, no problem No...no, we all agree I too thought of the same idea, sir But I didn't voice it not knowing if it'd be accepted Okay, okay Sit down, Rajesh Ms Rita, you can go ahead But handle it carefully Okay, take care Thank you, sir "Ring-a-ring 'o roses" "Pocket full of roses..." Hey! Sweety, come here Who are you? Whom do you want to see? - Are there any elders inside? - Oh, yes they are inside We need to talk about Anjali Will you call someone? Granny, someone's asking for Anjali 'Let me join with you' - Can we know who you are? - I want to talk about Anjali Shall we go inside? Come Sit down Who are you? I am Rita Chief reporter from SG T.V Your daughter is a famous actress No one is aware of her whereabouts for the past three years Our channel is trying to find out where she is and what she's doing now We need some details Even we don't care about that run-away girl, why should you? She was least bothered about her mom or her siblings! That sinful wretch! I am her mom and she left 'me' high and dry! Sis, why are you getting tensed? Your blood pressure will shoot up - Who are they? - T.V reporter They want to know about Anjali Why don't you just say you know nothing? Did you give birth to a girl? More likely, Lord Yama (God of death)! Madam, can she run away abandoning this family? Even now it's not too late All she has to do is make a single call At least 10 producers are waiting to book her Rs 10 million for each film Ever since she left we've been so worried You are adding fuel to the fire! 'They don't look the least bit worried!!' On top of it she willed half her earnings to temples and orphanages Did you complain to the cops? We did But if we apply pressure she'll be targeted by the press Only our family reputation will be at stake! We have another daughter ready to get married Who'll marry her? You tell me Thanks, we'll take leave Yes, madam I'm from SG T.V I know you very well As soon as you said you wanted to meet me I knew it must be something of importance There are many actresses in the reel world who come... ...conquer and quickly disappear But Anjali who's missing from her own home, was introduced by you! We are doing a program on Anjali So we are trying to gather information If you could share all that you know it would be very helpful to us Such an amazing girl I've introduced many girls in my cinema career She stands apart amidst that group As soon as she started earning a lot because of her mother's attitude... ...her family circumstances changed But she never changed She was the same from day one till the very end As soon as I heard she was missing with my friends' help I tried to find her This is cinema I could try only within a limit Her own parents are not bothered So people would attribute unnecessary motives to my quest That's my fear She'll definitely be somewhere around Sorry, I made you wait for a long time - It's okay - Tell me We'd like to know a few facts about the missing Anjali There's gossip linking you both right from the 1st film you directed I read articles about that Rumors say she even went to the extent of trying to kill herself Madam, this is cinema I am a director and she's a heroine I might have spoken and spent time with her during the shoot It could have been easily misconstrued I was co-director in Anjali's debut film That's why we became good friends It might have irked a lot of people But my conscience is clear Her family is the only reason for her to be missing, I'm sure She has confided many times about them and felt sad Isn't Sama who acted as her friend your wife? Yes, madam People claim after Sama's entry as an actress that you and Anjali drifted apart There's no compulsion she has to act Sama comes from an affluent family It's just her passion Same time, I've come up the hard way in this industry I know cinema only too well No one can confuse anyone I must go now for my shoot Thank you so much for your valuable time One thing is clear Anjali is missing because of all their selfish nature It must have affected her to that extent Only if we find Anjali we can get to the bottom of this I ask for a heroine's photo You bring me her mother's photo!! This one is much better than the one you chose! Why don't you just give what the director wants! Come, madam Did you want to interview me? - I wanted to meet Arogyasami - Here he is... I am that abandoned orphan! Do you have call-sheet problem? Shall I manage your dates? I need to talk something very important with you - Have you brought any pictures with you? - I am SG TV owner Tell me, ma'am Where is Anjali? Everyone tells me that you know where she is That's what all these fellow spin a yarn Even last week, the cops took me asking me her whereabouts... ...hit me and sent me back in a freezer! Not even my wife respects me My life was so bright when that madam was around If you find her, please tell me At least then my life will improve 'If everyone denies any knowledge who knows the truth?' There's someone here asking for you Here is she Thanks Aren't you Anjali's personal hair dresser? Yes,madam I need to talk to you alone I need to know a fact from you Everyone claims Anjali is wonderful I don't expect the same answer from you! You've been with her right from the start It takes a girl to understand another girl You've been with her from her 1st film to till she disappears You'll know where she is for sure Hmmm...you are right, madam But how will she confide everything in me? I don't know much Everyone has plenty of personal problems How will they reveal all that? 'I was suspicious of her I began to watch her' Hello, I am Mariyamma speaking How is Anjali madam? A TV reporter has been asking about her I said I don't know But I'm not too sure that she believes me Take care She might land up there Only God and you are her support I'll hang up now You know where Anjali is Don't hide anything from us She won't be hurt or harmed by me But if you don't tell me I'll complain about you to the police Sometimes only some people you can regard as divine, in cinema She is one such divine being When my own children treated me callously... ...she regarded me like her own mother! But people around her treated her like a money making machine Anjali went in search of a quiet place forsaking fortune and fame I showed her a religious sanctuary where she is now staying happily - Should you spoil her peace of mind? - I'll not make her unhappy Trust me Where is she? Do you know a girl named Anjali? I don't know ma'am Ask Guruji who's upstairs Priest What? Is there anyone by the name of Anjali? There's no one called Anjali Anjali whom you are looking for is here Anjali I didn't want anyone to find me Who are you? I am Rita SG TV chief reporter I'm leading a peaceful life here Why are you bothering me? I haven't come here to pester you Whatever I heard about you stunned me No one can live as a good Samaritan in everyone's eyes! But you have done the impossible I disguised myself only when I acted But the people around me acted so hypocritically...that's real disguise! I don't want to rob you of your privacy and make you a commercial proposition I want to be your friend and sister and get to know you better I knew to make everyone happy But God deprived me of that state One moment This diary contains all information about me I don't wish to talk about my life and accumulate more sin! 'I come from a beautiful small village in Nellore, Andhra Pradesh' 'My father was Devaraj, a drama artiste' 'We could hardly make ends meet with the meager sum he earned by acting' 'My mother Girija, worked in the fields and raised us with great difficulty' 'I spent happy days of my childhood with my younger brother and sister' Anjali, take care of your younger siblings - May thorn bites them - Ok, mom Anjali, you go in 2 months ago you gave us Rs 1000 We don't even have provisions to cook I made porridge for the kids with the rice I borrowed from our neighbor Alamu I have no idea what I'll do tomorrow Girija, am I not aware of our plight? It's not as if you need to enlighten me! 'I came of age one day' 'My mother performed all rituals that's customarily followed, for me too' 'One day, my mother and I consulted an astrologer on the roadside' She has the grace of God Her father's job is art related She has a good future Her life takes a turn from the 12th of this month 'Dakshinamurthy, my mother's brother My sister's husband and my uncle' Bearded uncle...where's my wife? I mean, your eldest daughter Yeah...you get drunk daily and then hit your wife When you become sober you come in search of her frantically! Uncle, life has day and night Joy and sorrow side by side I'd like to know if any wife runs to her parents' house when she's happy? How is it if she receives just 4 slaps when I'm not in my sense she comes crying here? How just is this?! Do you know why I hit your daughter? I know you too well, you good for nothing oaf! Let's go home, wifey! - She isn't at home - Where has she gone? How would I know?! 'One day, all the villagers came to my house' 'That was the day of 'the 1st turning point in my life' May I know why you have all come to this poor artiste's humble abode? What kind of question is this? Do you know the good news we want to share with you? Good news? You listened to some jobless woman and stopped... ...my annual play in the temple Now I'm struggling to make ends meet and chopping firewood to sell What good news? Remember the play 'Velu nachiyar' that you used to enact long ago? Will you showcase that play again? The girls who acted in that play are married and well settled How will I find artistes? Devaraj! Why do you hunt for ghee when you are holding butter in your hands? What does that mean? Don't you understand? Your daughter Anjali can act My wife and children have got an aversion to drama! Let this act end with me! Devaraj, you couldn't taste success Why think the same of your daughter? She'll definitely succeed Make her act, friend Let me consult her and then I'll let you know We'll take leave But let us know soon Father, what are you saying? You want me to act? Yes, my dear But when I was young you said I should never act! Why have you changed your mind all of a sudden? I have gone to everywhere aspiring to be an actor and asking for a chance This chance comes to you on our door step! Accept it, dear Why is Anjali walking away without replying? Not only in drama, even in films she'll be very famous That lady-astrologer said so! We'll be heaped with money in bundles! Don't build castles in the air 1st find out is he wants to act Why ask her? She won't disobey us Anjali, I'm happy you are acting in our village play You refused to act and now my words are coming true! She hasn't agreed even now Her father had a tough time convincing her Anjali will be very famous one day Just see how true my words will be! May your words come true I'll ask Anjali to take care of your entire wedding expenses - Is your mother at home? - She's gone to the temple When she comes will you ask her for a loan of Rs 500? I'll repay her next week Okay, aunty 'My parents decided for me that I should act' 'I became an actress' 'I got ready for my 1st play' - Stop your play - Why? As if you don't know why! I don't have to as far as I know Don't test my patience Why should I stop the play just 'cos your daughter is not acting? Did I ask you for a chance for her to act? You wanted my daughter to act You came pleading at my door step You humiliated her in front of all these people Uncle, why are you getting disgraced in front of all these people? I'll tell you what would have transpired Last night he'd have visited Guntur Kokila's house That's why her daughter was substituted after their private night-play! Is she more beautiful than my daughter? Your daughter is beautiful Who is denying that? So? Will she do whatever this girl is willing to comply? How dare you malign my daughter? Mother! Don't!! Don't do Don't!! How dare you talk ill of my daughter! How dare you? Stop it! You were all entertained by my husband Now you are humiliating our family Did we ask to act in this play? You came and requested us Enough of being humiliated I'll make my daughter stand with respect and dignity... ...in this same village that she was disgraced Not just this village but the whole world will applaud and acclaim her acting talent I promise you this I'm there for you I'll take you to Chennai and make you # 1 actress 'I experienced disgrace and humiliation for the 1st time' 'This day was the 1st day that sowed the seeds to my celluloid journey' '1st of many moments of expectation anticipation...confusion...imagination' 'My mother and I carried all of this to Chennai' You both are traveling to Chennai for the 1st time It won't be insular like our village You must be on your guard Do you realize that?

Are you doing good? - How are you mother? I miss you both - Come back soon, mother - We'll be back soon, dear I'll give the phone to father now You went away to the city with Anjali whether a good decision or not It's a little uncomfortable listening to people gossip But I have faith in your will and resolve You don't worry about us We'll deal with this as best we can Otherwise we'll leave this world together Okay Girija, I'm out of money, bye now What is it, Girija? You said you wanted to talk but now you are just sitting there like that My daughter will become an actress, won't she? If she doesn't get the chance, I don't know who will But I don't know when it will come I can't bear this wait, sister My husband has to deal with the kids all alone back at home And the money it takes to live here does not help matters The only solution that will help is if Anjali becomes a star Let me tell you something, Girija Before your daughter decides to sacrifice herself for your family... ...give yourself up to make her grow For her to become a star and for your family problems to end You need to be the candle It is not wrong to do so I think you understand what I'm saying Think carefully I won't betray you Say the word and I will get a man whom I know from Karaikudi Listen to me and you'll be fine Your family problems will end as well 'Me and my mother went back home' My lord! How about you Girija? Last week you asked me over the phone to give your husband Rs 5000 and you said you'd send it immediately but you still haven't I'll go home and send it to you Mom! Just for me to succeed, both my siblings are working... ...and we are struggling in Madras - I feel frustrated, mother - You don't confuse yourself, Anjali Don't tell your father anything I'll take care of everything Father? Father! How are you? Anjali! Come my dear Girija! How are you? - Good, where are the kids? - You 2 have shown up out of the blue If they knew you were coming they wouldn't have gone to work Have you got a chance in the movies as yet? Yes, we got an advance and we've come straight home Really? That's wonderful! Devaraj's daughter will never fail Here is the money There's 5000 rupees here You repay our debt Okay, Girija - Sister? - I knew it, here take it and go! 500! I can drink two full bottles For how much longer are you going to lie to dad? Where did you get the money from? Did Rukmani 'sister' give it to you? Yes 'We came back to Chennai and started our celluloid-hunt!' 'Arogyasami was a film co-ordinator It's through him that I got my 1st break' - Oh Director, when are you going to start? - If he knew, wouldn't he tell you? That's it We haven't found a girl Girl? You sound like you are looking for a bride! - Good day, sir! - Did you find a girl? I brought 50 from Bombay, 50 from Kerela...20 from Andhra Now we know the reason behind the missing chain cases You be quiet! Come outside and I will take care of you Forget me, tell him about the girl Shut up If you want a girl beyond all this... ...I'll either have to give birth to 1 or make one I brought 1, go see He's saying it over and over? Go see, sir! Come, sir I have to listen to all this crap to make a movie! Get lost You came from the village to take a movie with all your money Why didn't you consult a man like me? Why did you pick a director with flops? - He's given 10 hits and only 2 flops - They exile people with even 1 flop And you are sitting and talking to a man who has 2 to his credit! If there's a problem in the lab, I won't come to your rescue Get lost! I know how to handle this Mind your business When the director comes, you stand up and wish him He's taken 10 movies Anjali, this is an important opportunity Pray to God that it works Will this work at least? - Greetings, sir! - Sit down! 'Oh rock a by-baby your tresses on your body' Yo! Let him look at the girl first She is the girl I told you, sir What's your name? Anjali There's already an actor called Anjali Then you change the name for her yourself why don't you? So shall we pick a name that starts with R? Sure No no...director Bharathiraja has his copyright on that! - Pick a name that starts with U - You be quiet! Cinema is a different kind of ball-game altogether Are you okay with all of that? There will be good and bad in everything, isn't it, sir? In other jobs it all happens with consent In this one, you might not even be okay with it That's why we came to a decent, experienced director like you, sir She's talking without knowing she's been caught Just agree Your age and your decency reassures us you'd be a father and brother to us I am sure you have no other motive It's a good dialogue Write it down, you won't think of better Your daughter is okay for my script I'll talk to the producer and let you know You go now I'll talk business and then come meet you Say thanks to him Thank you, sir Why does she bow so much? Sir, is there even a story? He said it was okay for his story Didn't you hear that? Oh I understood Maintain this same story! They started off by calling me a father and a brother - Do you think this will work? - You start the shooting, sir Everything else will be agreed to Oh Goddess, everything has worked just like I asked For this to sail smoothly and for her to be a famous heroine,... ...you must be our guide Bless us 'My happiness didn't last even for a day' - Hello? It's me Arogyasami speaking - What is it? When will you give us the advance money? I've already booked a girl by advancing on her!! They trust you so much I said I'd okay everything What belief does she have in me? She wants to be a heroine and covers herself from head to toe... ...and gives 'bonding' dialogs! They won't comply to my terms put the phone down - Please, sir - Oi! I told you to hang up 'Whatever happens let it happen' Hello, yes... How did you know its me Anjali's mother speaking - I know your area #s! - What did the director say? Let's go to a different company Why? - The director rejected Anjali - Why? I'll get you a better offer Trust me - Did he give a reason? - Will they ever give a reason? What are you say? They'll nod their head in the affirmative... ...in the day and change their mind at nightfall! This is all quite common in cinema Hang up I am trusting you like God I'll talk to you later Now disconnect your call Why does it happen like this only to me? He was glorifying you big time Don't know what happened in between He rejected you I don't know what to do What kind of rut are we in? What are mother and daughter duo lamenting about? What else to do? They okayed her yesterday and now fixed another girl, it seems That's why we are so troubled Leave it, they would have found a better girl, its quite common in cinema So be it Why hurt us? Why disappoint my girl? That's cinema's fate! What else to say? My anger and frustration will definitely affect that director! Don't get stressed out I can't bear it if it ruins your health Enough of this stupid reel-world Why expect and yearn and not earn Might as well go back to our village Why are you in a hurry? You've gone through a lot of trouble How can you decide that 1 lost chance will seal all other chances forever? I think we are better off going back I don't want this cinema You don't know about this world Only when you relinquish it it will come in search of you! Think twice before you decide I'll go and talk to that co-ordinator for you Hello, all in all? 'Rukku my dear What can I do for you?' You are a master at glib-talk! You couldn't make a heroine out of a beautiful girl I gave you 'Was your call to rub salt on to my wound?!' 'You won't call without a motive Come to the point' What happened to 'Anjali matter'? 'Is it about that?' 'I briefed her mother about everything Director expects extra benefits' 'She is dishing out sibling sentiments' How will it work out? 'So what is your solution?' 'There's a new party from Bombay They are planning to start a film' 'Ask Anjali's mother to talk to the director That will work out' Oh! That simple, is it? 'Ask her to talk explicitly' Okay, fine You cut the call - You spoke to Arogyasami? - I did - What did he say? - He spoke the truth What truth? I have to spell it out blatantly to you In this real world you can get something only if you lose something in life But in this reel world only if you lose everything... ...your dreams will come true We may even regret and be ashamed of what we lost But if we succeed, today's error will prove to be the right decision tomorrow You are saying something so out of context to what I asked Isn't Anjali equipped with beauty or acting prowess? Director 'wants her'! Her beautiful body!!' He hasn't rejected her as yet If your daughter gives in to his wishes and pleases him... ...the way that Bombay girl is ready to comply, Anjali will be his heroine I gave up being with my husband and children I even gave myself up! Now... I too find it tough to make a lady hear words no mother should! It happens only here This director will get 1000 girls if it is not your daughter But you have to traumatize yourself walking up and down many companies If all of them expect you to compromise, what will you do then? This director has given 8 hits and only 2 flops Won't he have a strong desire to make this film a box office hit? By God's grace all the 10 heroines he has introduced are stars now Goddess of fortune is knocking at your door It is your call whether you want to open or shut the door in Her face! This is the director's mobile number You take the right decision 'Your daughter is beautiful Who is denying that? So?' 'Will she do whatever this girl is willing to comply?' 'Not just this village but the whole world will applaud and acclaim her acting talent' 'We'll deal with this as best we can Otherwise we'll leave this world together' Mother! What happened? Tell me, mom Anjali Tell me what's troubling you Right or wrong we are here Like your father said we should win Or else we should perish with our whole family But why should we die? You are endowed with beauty and intelligence I have faith in your acting skill Our family's future is in your hands No one can be prepared to face failure in life Mother, I don't understand a word of what you are saying! You don't have to understand Shall I just make 1 request? Will you consent whatever it is? Tell me Whatever I say? Tell me, mother What should I do? We should hold our heads high with dignity to the village that disgraced us We are now struggling for money That same wealth should be heaped on us The hunger that traumatized us should not be... ...experienced by 7 generations of our family! Tell me, mother What should I do? You should sacrifice yourself Mother? This is the decision your mother has taken The answer lies in your hands Mother! You've never made any wrong decision for our family I've also never disregarded your words You know that very well Whatever you decide will always be for my benefit Tell me what I should do Just tell me that You get ready I'll be back Hello Why did you reject my daughter after selecting her as your heroine? You desire to earn and be a heiress in our world You have to struggle and climb a few steps You are not willing to come down? Please make her a sought-after heroine, sir After meeting your daughter we sent a mail to Bombay... ...and that girl agreed to all our wants She has come and accomplished everything She has become a heroine If my daughter agrees to do whatever you asked that Bombay girl to do... Then, won't my girl be the heroine? For sure! Okay, sir My daughter will do as you please Really! So your daughter confirmed heroine in this film I'll come this evening Send your daughter with me in my car to my cottage I'll take her sky-high! Forgive me! Come...come - When did you all come? - We came long ago Greetings Go and take his blessing May you be happy This is my girl It is her 1st film Make sure you teach her the right steps for her to dance Okay sir 'My 1st film was launched' 'We vacated and went to live in a flat' 'I took my family members to my 1st day of shoot' 'Since I knew him well I was very casual and informal' Look here! Do you know what natural acting is? To take a dialog right into your soul and reproduce it spontaneously It's not just your life Mine too is at stake Cry baby! You aspire to be a big star! That alone is not enough Idiot! Act properly Come here and coach her properly What kind of slipshod work are you doing? All half baked idiots - Director, sir - Shut up This is what happens if I choose an amateur cast 'The only solace came from co-director Manoj' 'But I didn't know then that he'd shape my future' "Look who is going...hello!" "Look at this angel glow With her golden halo" "Cotton mattress soft and fluffy Caresses my heart; walks past happily" "Look at her style: her grace" "Look at the charm she displays" "Hot and svelte she sways" "Sun at dawn as her avatar" "Like banana stem her legs slender" "Temple tower reaches the sky Heartbeat swings an all-time high" "Like an Arabian horse elegant this fresh waterfall flows eloquent" "Swinging walk, curved delight Hips hypnotize the mind infinite" "Are you the beauty sublime created by Brahma divine?" "Koel that sings aloud? Tresses like onyx cloud?" "Full moon's clone? 5' bunny as a boon?" "Mere glances Or baited advances" "Figure of a damsel? Or a pillar in a temple?" "When she bends and straightens mind breaks into turbulence" "A face radiant always Cloud reflecting the moon's rays" "Who is she...this girl so lovely? Who is this lady so lively?" "Is she a flower tantalizing males? A flame submerging waves?" "A rose from Kashmir exotic? Anchor in a TV show angelic?" "A body glittering beautifully A walking marvel is she?" "World sleepless thanks to her beauty Her lips are a wine shop, beguiling booty?" "Waist slim and enchanting Nectar sweet body, enriching" "Eyes that relish, koel to cherish Lips waiting to be ravished" "Beautiful bud blushing maroon Footprint on earth of the moon?"

"Radio relaying glances like songs sexy?" "Hearts miss many a beat when eyebrows arch so sweet" "A face radiant always Cloud reflecting the moon's rays" "Who is she...this girl so lovely? Who is this lady so lively?" 'I acted in every successful director's film in Tamil cinema' 'We got all the fame and fortune my mother ever aspired for' 'As my life was moving on my debut film's director...' '...came home asking for my dates' Look at the producer queue waiting for her call sheet At one time weren't you climbing their office steps... ...up and down, up and down Don't go and ask for a miserly 30-40 lakhs from them Ask for a single payment 75 lakhs - If in instalments then 1 crore! - Will they agree? Of course they will, sister I will make sure they do, trust me - You know that Arogyasami... - Who? That self proclaimed co-ordinator He has gone and created a ruckus in Anjali's make up room yesterday I sent 4 of my men to take him apart They did a neat job He won't step this way anymore - I am her manager from now on - Let's go Entire Reel world is here - That's true - Hey! I meant you introduced her How can you go wrong?! Don't do anything hanky panky You won't get what is top-priority! Just see the respect mother and daughter duo will shower on me Let that be Is there any cash in this box? I have a cheque in there So long as it passes, fine! - Here, madam - Thanks Director who introduced my sister is here Good...good So please take leave Somehow we got her dates We can proceed further Anjali, how are you? So many producers at your door step Play your cards right! What's up? New film Heroine oriented subject Sir is directing He wants Anjali to act We wanted to know about your dates Go inside Anjali, are you happy? Anjali... Can I sit here and discuss terms? It's okay, when have you ever given respect to the production manager? We've come only to enquire about the date NO date! It is common to say no to dates for a heroine in the peak of her career ...and for a known director to be given the dates despite her busy schedule! If you give 10 days a month, we'll finish it off in 4 months What you are saying is fine We'll do it for 1 crore salary 1 crore?! Do you know how many zeroes in 1 crore? My brother can figure that out You'll get dates after 2 years If she gets dates after 2 years, she'll be stuck acting as mother! Do you remember the fact that our director is the man who introduced her? - I remember that very well - And still you talk like this? You talk as if you did me a favour when we came begging for a chance There was a mistake that day All this happens in the world of cinema It happens? You send a girl into a room with some random man ...under the pretence of giving her a role! Do you know what it feels like to be a mother to that girl? Your dialogs are a little too exaggerated, mother What is your final decision? Even if you give us crores and crores my daughter will not act in this man's film If such a situation arises, she will no longer act Why is this woman talking like this? Let it be, have you forgotten the past? Girija, cinema revolves around looking down on people who brought you up You have put me in that list as well, haven't you? No man has been destroyed by humility and none has survived an ego-trip! In gratitude to his guru... ...this is the land that boasts of Ekalayva who sacrificed his thumb! I'm going to see how both of you 'crash and burn' for this ungratefulness Come, let's go Just because you have 4 cars outside, doesn't give you the right to talk this way We are the ones who brought your daughter to fame If I don't get another girl who comes and throws her over... ...I will not call myself production manager - This is a challenge, let's see - He is talking like a noble person 'Is this my mother? How much she's changed' 'I'm shocked' 'Testimony will continue...' Anjali, remember how at one point of time... ...people in our village spoke so badly of us? But those same people now seeing your fame and fortune ...are dying to get married to you Why should I rush into marriage now? You don't have to, right now But you know the actor Vinu whom you are acting with now... ...seems like such a nice boy He's an only son and he's very rich He came and asked me instead of asking you He's a good boy I've told you what I had to say The rest is up to you What you are saying is right, mother After we get married what if he asks me to stop acting in movies So what? We came here, acted in 10 movies We'll go back marrying a rich man He said he'd come here depending on what you say You think about it and then tell me, dear Hello, auntie! Oh here he is Jeeva! Go bring a chair - Yes ma'am - Please sit down Mariamma, go! I told her everything you told me She's also okay with it Are you happy? Auntie, is that true? Ask her yourself I need to go meet the producer I'll be back You keep talking till then Did your mother tell you everything I told her? You are okay with it, aren't you? I'm very lucky 2 minutes! Director called me I need to go see what he wants Sister, this is ECR property He's asking for 6 crores - 6 crores? - I'm sleepy, let's go mother If you're sleepy, go sleep Can't you see we are discussing important things? Okay we'll finalize it for a single payment What do you say? Oh sister, look who's here! Come come, hero! Come come great star that gave 7 hits Oh big hero, how are you doing? Yes I'm fine What are the other movies you have committed to? 10 producers and 5 directors have approached me today All the companies have asked for our combination I agreed to 3 of them They'll probably bring the advance over tomorrow I won't agree I'm sick of acting in the same combination Why are you talking like this? Don't you see how much concern he has for us ...that he's coming here so late? Am I not part of your family? The movie that we acted in together is running successfully for 50 days Nowadays 4 weeks-run is rare! It's broken records beyond that The only reason behind that is our combination And for that, here's a small gift This is for you, aunty What is all this for, son? Whether or not my daughter has become a good actress ...my wife certainly has! Anjali, the next gift is for you Vinod! Who asked you to do all this? Anjali! The poor boy means well How can you refuse him? - Son, put it around her neck yourself - Thanks, auntie Please, sit down When we were in the village, my family was good So was my wife Anjali! You don't worry, I'll go talk to her Keep this here, I'll come back Don't worry Don't worry You don't feel bad about this son She's like her father I won't worry I'm taking it the right way I know about Anjali I'm leaving now I have an early morning shoot It's okay You spoilt any gift he intended to give me too! This boy has acted in 12 films as hero and they were all hits He's going to act in 10 more and make tens of hundreds of crores Hey! Cutting you up in pieces would feed 10 families!! You are roaming around with no pride or shame ...drunk on the fame of your sister's daughter If this man becomes our groom then your life, my life and this idiot's life will all be amazing! Think about it! 'I fell into his love trap one fine day' - Do you feel a little strange? - Yes It must feel like a flight has taken off 'For the 1st time, I lost myself to a man because of love' Anjali! What happened? Tell me! Are you pregnant? Why did you do this? I only asked you to be friendly with him, not... Okay, you come in Vanaja! Sit down Yes, madam? - Does he know about this? - Yes He said you'd only get married after 2 years But he acted in haste! There are still 4 movies you have to finish And you got an advance for a new one yesterday What do we do now? What, Girija? Is everything happening like you wanted? Keep at it! Let's see how long this goes on - Shut up and get back to your work - I will! You think there won't be an end to this? Here you go, ma'am Drink this What happened? Why did you ask me to come here so early? A new movie? An advance? I called for something else By then, so many things have happened here Why are you signaling to me like that? Oh wow! This is brilliant, sister! Shall we threaten him and make some cash? Get lost! Anjali? What exactly happened? - He'd give his life for me - That's all okay Now he's created a life within you! He looked pretty harmless in the beginning But then he showed no respect to me I thought he might do something! I expected a sixer! But he's hit a century Okay, what do we do now, sister? Even now, he hasn't said anything wrong He has said that he'll marry Anjali in 2 years Oh he's got a 2 year bail, is it? But the kid will be out in 7 months What will you do then? Then news will come in the paper People will ask for their advance back He's done well by getting us a bungalow It doesn't matter that she's at the peak of her career The only problem is that my food will get some mud in it, metaphorically speaking That's just my fear - Shut up! - That's all you have to say to me! Even now you talk about money than being worried about me Wait Give me your phone - Is this Vinod? - Yes, auntie - Are you at shooting? - Yes, auntie I need to talk to you about something important Tell me, auntie Anjali, eat something You haven't eaten anything since you got back from the hospital You need to take your medication as well Please eat something - Eat, dear - Please eat, sister I'm telling you I don't want to Don't irritate me, please go away - What's happening? - We asked her to eat so she got angry - Why Anjali? You don't want to eat? - You have time to notice all that, mother? - Why are you talking like this, Anjali? - Because I feel like it Why are you talking to your mother like this? Forget the past, dear What are you asking me to forget, mother? Do you want me to forget all the mistakes I made... ...in order to make it big in this industry? Because of your greed for money and dad's desire to act and be famous... do you want me to forget that my life has become a mess? Do you want me to forget the love I felt for that man... ...and the pain I feel for letting go of that child? You keep praying to all Gods for a baby for my elder sister Could you save the baby that was in my womb? Everybody in this house wants my money Everybody outside who sees me wants my body What kind of life is this? Why so rush? - Mother, Mother - What is it, Mariamma? You listened to your mother and now you'll be ruined! Tell me what are you talking about! That Vinod who said he would marry you? He's getting married to someone else! What did I ever do to you? You heard about my marriage? I'm a rich guy! I will marry!! I can get a 100 heroines like you! Where did your brains go? Why did you listen to me? After all, you are just an actress I'm supposed to start a family with someone like you? You think actresses are that cheap, huh? We are people too! Your cheap brain will get many women So why are you bugging us like this? We also have feelings and emotions like other people Disgusting! Why demean that? You used words like love and marriage ...just so that you could be with me for a day This might be a big joke to you ...but what it did to me will not leave your bloodline alone The God I pray to didn't let me down At least it stopped me from marrying a lowlife like you You are no man! I'm warning you! Your very breath should not walk past my doorstep ever again Hey look at this! It says Anjali and Vinod broke up - Show me - Look here 'The production manager found a new heroine to take his revenge on me' My dear...sit You are life... ...you are the beginning and you are the end I've seen many girls, but I've never seen a girl of your size and your beauty - Take your hand away! - It's only my hand Don't I know where you keep your hand? I came to this place all fresh and young but now... I gave a swimming pool, a car and a bungalow You gave everything ...but I didn't get to act in Kodambakkam's cinema You claimed you know producer Super good Chowdhry, A.M.Rathnam Kalpathi Agoram, Nemichand Jhabak and even Aascar films Ravi! But you haven't shown me even one person If you had, my life would be shining - I never saw you as a heroine - Then what? As a comedian? No! As my wife, my love and my life My heart is for you We're made for each other Love and love only If you talk like this I will kill you My whole life is gone thanks to your smooth talk - Sister? - Yes? Did I trespass into some family discussion? Why did you come here? I didn't come here of my own accord Sister called me I came Till now everything was good, I wonder what's going to happen Till now, nothing happened, everything good will happen now That's my sister, how is she? Please stand up Oh! Tamil Nadu would be lucky to have a girl like her If I had seen her earlier I'd have made her a heroine Why are you hitting me? This is my job! Look at the rice bag that you have given birth to - You gave birth too! - Oh I forgot Sister! All sorts of famous directors are looking at for heroines immediately We need to get rid of Anjali who is currently #1 in the industry - Our protegee will be # 1 - They didn't tell us They'll only do that when half the movie is over If you make my sister a heroine, then you will be the manager Not now! Stand up! If she becomes a heroine, you can sit even on my lap Till then, Seth-ji, sell all your wealth and take a film like Avatar with me Start itself seems not too hopeful! - What have you come for? - Geetha's marriage - Who's Geetha? - She's my daughter, can't you see? Why do you need to bring the bride all this way? A simple invitation will suffice Coming straight to one's house is respectful Why would people who are struggling for food worry about respect? Were we struggling for food? You were the one who was struggling back in the village We came all the way here to invite only because Anjali's my close friend Tell Anjali when she comes home I will, go! Come mother, let's go Look at how these illiterate people talk - Bring me some tea - Coming madam Mother! - What is it? What happened? - What is this? Oh that? Geetha's getting married back in the village She came with her mother to invite us - Why didn't you tell me they came? - It's not such a big deal You know that Geetha's my dear friend She was such a source of strength when I was struggling to make it big It was her love that wiped away my tears when we were struggling over here in the city Am I a mere money making machine? Is it my job to buy you a house and get my siblings married? Don't I have a dream of my own? Even I was not aware they had come, dear What have you cared to know, father? What use is it whatever I know?! Everyone comes to me with their own hidden agenda But my friend Geetha's friendship is unconditional affection Her wedding has got over I wanted to do so much for her wholeheartedly What has happened according to my wish? If something happens to me, tomorrow you'll cry that you've lost access to my wealth I know that But she is one who'll cry truly for me Money shouldn't blur your vision Then you'll become totally blind! 'As we made more and more money, my mother's greed for it grew as well' 'My uncle was equally responsible for it' - Where's your brother? Tell me! - 1st tell me who you are - Answer my question, you! - Mother, what is all this? She'll tell...patience! Who are you all? Making a scene in my own house! You are hitting my own son under my roof I'll show you who I am I'm Anjali's mother speaking Is the minister there? It's me on the line Yes, Girija Some rowdies have come and are making a scene here, sir Who are they? Give them the phone Here, talk Is this Minister Arunachalam? They needed rowdies for their work They needed me to pacify those rowdies Anjali? My sweetheart! She agreed to it somehow 'My mother was a woman herself, wasn't she?' 'But why didn't she think of me as a woman?' - Anjali, Anjali? - What is it? You are late for your shoot Wake up and get ready - Tell them to cancel it - Oh! You want to cancel it? - Is she crazy! - You shut up Anjali, everybody has already reached the shooting spot... ...including the hero, it won't be nice if we cancel it Let it not be nice! Either cancel the shooting today or tell them to remove me from the film What she's doing isn't right, sister Tell her to get ready now Uncle, you go mind your own business Mother, will you never understand me? I have a heart too! Aren't you going to ever think about that? I'm not a robot, I'm also a woman Ask them to postpone the shoot for 4 days, please I'll do that, I'll ask them to cancel it Not only will we be humiliated, you'll have to meet the council - It's all my fate! - We can cancel it if you want, Anjali But that producer's a cut-throat man when it comes to business Don't come to me if there's a problem I have a hectic schedule! 'What the hell happened to her?' I believe what you say is right Anjali is a well known actress But you are a new face How will you get dates? Trust me, Seth-ji, she's ready to give me dates whenever I ask her If she says okay, we'll immediately launch the film, you are its director 'I decided never to act again But I changed my mind for Manoj' - Good day, sir! - Back like a bad penny! - Good day, madam - Hmm - We came to talk about something important - Tell me He has a new project lined up If you are okay with it, we'd like to get dates Madam, if Anjali madam agrees to be my heroine I'll definitely have a chance of being a director In her present mindset, I haven't been able to get her to give dates ...for movies she's already accepted She says she won't go to the shooting spot at all If you tell your story now, you think she'll agree? If you are okay with it, we could try talking to her about all of this 'She's already sympathetic about these 2' 'Maybe they can persuade her!' Yes, go and try Stairs are that way - Madam - Good day - Come, sit down - Thank you - What's news? - Good news! Manoj has a project lined up Oh Congratulations! That's very good to hear - This happiness lies in your hands - What are you saying? It's hard for assistant directors to get a chance like this And they've given him a big banner name and actor But that actor says he will act only if you are paired with him You know very well that I haven't been able to commit to my current movies... ...because I'm stressed and I don't have future plans in this industry I understand your pain, it's wrong of us to bug you now But this is my life, the hero who listened to 15 stories ...accepted only mine, the 16th It's a big banner, madam If you say okay, they said they'll start tomorrow If you say okay, then his mother's dream of this boy being a director will be fulfilled That's not the only thing, this 1 man's victory will give all of us some hope and life! Please give me some time to think about it We don't have time to think about giving time, madam What did you just say? Give me one week In 1 week, that producer will run away Then where will this boy run to? She laughed, means she has consented! 'Manoj also became a director' Action! 'No hero is giving me dates to direct a film!' Must somehow convince this oldie to produce! I am plagued my emails asking you to act again! Lord Muruga! Not the Lord People are mailing me! What does it matter who sends Come to the point! Respect foremost! Director is right! Poongudi is a picturesque village You are a big time land lord there You respect the soil so much you walk bare feet in that village Villagers respect and salute you - But in your own house... - In my home? Your wife hits you with a ladle and stick She is a demoness Don't malign my wife She's like God to me I'm describing the character in my story Go on... Into that village enters a teenager Just 18 years old I link her and you together Right connection!! Mustn't link in this age! - I meant, in my story - Go ahead To tease you she asks you to carry a huge stone found in the village I can't lift - Not even this stone? - No, I can't Hero is too weak I'll make a twist in the story for your sake You don't have to lift anything Heroine will lift you Let her lift by all means Why are you telling me all this? Why? Because heroes nowadays produce their own films and release them I thought you'd also follow their footsteps I haven't even taken a snap with my own money! Then what about all those pictures hanging there? Someone takes and someone puts them up 'I fell in love with Manoj who became a director because of me' Why are you hiding stuff from me? You think I don't know the pains you go through daily? Director seems a good man Sister, I lost everything My future and my life You are the reason You'll never make me a heroine She has started off on her tirade God knows how far she'll go - All your left over syndrome! - Is it important now? - I am telling the fact - What you are doing is not right You came to Chennai with hopes of acting You ended up with a glorified title as companion to this rich financier! You asked me to be manager to your younger sister as an actress Neither did she act Nor did I become a manager - Let me go buy some vegetables - Look at my wife Instead of becoming a famous celebrity she is buying vegetables in the market! - Why are you lamenting like this? - I am telling the fact All the producers in the city are financed by our Seth-ji All he needs to do is make 1 call, your sis will be a heroine Both you and I can live with respect and prosper What can I do? I've tried telling that insensitive oaf zillion times Can he be so thick skinned as rain falling on a buffalo? You should be more convincing! If she gets any older she won't even do justice to a mother's role! Give him your ultimatum today - What do I do? - Ask me for idea! Manoj writes, acts and directs - Why do directors double as heroes? - That's fate They go to a heroine with a good story But the story doesn't get heard Doors get shut on their faces So they end up with this disastrous decision If our girl acts in Manoj's story she'll be right on top! Our man Seth-ji is the financier for it He loved the story so much and has offered to produce it himself That boy will agree to everything your financier says! So just call and make him nod his head Like this Not push it to one side! Careful Super, pencil! You sent for me urgently Yeah, no water in the rest room Fill up a few buckets! Mad fellow! She came as competition to top stars Ambika and Radha Moment you entered her life she lost her dreams and her life! If you don't grant my wish now I'll come to your door step and push a few home-truths down your wife's throat Give that to me Do you see this? - Is it a rattle? - It's sleeping pills, beware! I'll swallow it and leave behind a note blaming you for my death! Don't be impulsive, dear I'll solve your problem When have you solved her problems? I don't know what you'll do Just make my sister a heroine! Is she rice or dhal that can be cooked easily! You migrate here from Rajasthan! On top of it all you mock at us! You better watch out Your family will know your true colors You better end Anjali's chapter And promote my sister instead Half the film has been already shot We know you can change everything including the end credits, don't we know! If you don't do your end is in our hands! Brother? Next step! I thought I'll make Roshni act in a big budget film But you need to get back all that you've invested Your twisted mouth and yawns!!! Enough wasting time Make up your mind Dignity or money? And make up your mind right now - Where is it? - Where is what? Sleeping tablet It is here Take a look Be careful Oh God! Lord Rama What will I do now?! 'At this time a tragic incident happened in my life' Is Anjali's mother such a big shot? I want her here and now She's refusing to comply, boss - Did you mention my name? - She said no after hearing your name! I'll show her who I am! Greetings Prostitution prevention section - I am Arunachalam speaking - Tell me, sir Actress Anjali's case Handle it as you usually do Ok, sir - Greetings, madam - Please take a seat When did you want dates? Who is the director? Director is not yet fixed Producer 1st wants your daughter's dates... ...before he decides about the rest of the team We prefer a heroine oriented script Today is an auspicious day 1st accept our advance money - Where did you get this? - 1st tell me who you are? Prevention of prostitution Special squad We've got information that you got this money through prostitution 1st know who I am! Yes, sir Tell me, sir 1 minute, sir Girija, now do you know what my powers are! If you had complied to my call you wouldn't be in this fix, right? What's your convenience now? Do you both want to count bars or come to my guest house? Do you want to live losing your respect, dignity and marketability as heroine... ...or come to my guest house? We'll come to your guest house 'Me becoming a heroine brought us so many vile threats and unhappiness' 'Is such a life worth all this suffering?' - Shall we roll camera? - Ravi call her - I need to talk to you - Come, I'm at the shoot Are you mad? I want to talk to you alone You can talk to me alone here Come from your caravan Sir, you fix the camera Ok, sir Heroine will walk towards the camera slowly Tilt up as she comes close Keep it ready Give me the pad Shall we check the dialogs, madam?! What's the problem, Anjali? - I am troubled - Why? What's up? As per your mother's wishes you are a famous director now This will definitely be a box office hit You'll continue to give consecutive hits You'll be well settled I trust you completely I too wish that for you Come to the point As days go by I wonder if I have the right to be your wife! I even think why I am alive Even now my happiest moments are time spent with you I know how your mother is treating you in her avariciousness for money I know about all the cruelty you are going through Wait for some more time Don't stress too much I've never fretted for myself I am just worried about our love When people take everything for granted in this world, I feel proud of the way you love me But I am scared time will take our love away from us Desire within me to enjoy all liberties with you is mounting day by day You have all rights as my wife Not just this birth but for all times Your mother is watching us You go 'My life is an unholy mess I wished a better life for my siblings' 'But...' - Is this your house? - Mother!!! Who is this glam-doll? Take a good look at him He is your son-in-law! I mean my husband What did you say? You are drunk and blabbering! Dakshinamurthy! Come here Who is this fellow? How dare you bring a scoundrel and introduce him as my son-in-law! What guts! I'll kill you Did you hear what she said? You know only the climax? I know the beginning of this film! Why didn't you tell me if you knew? Even after I got all this money I stick to my usual brand of alcohol But you went overboard You taught her driving, bought her a car... ...and sent her to discos Sons of millinaires are bound to hang around there Is he from a very affluent family? I have researched his family tree branch by branch! His dad sells prawn in Koyambedu Both his older sisters are inauspiciously sitting at home In short they are equivalent to a tattered tramp family Why did you hide this all from me? You bully me and shut my mouth all the time so effectively What do you want me to do? A car only when it is moving will have a flat tyre Only then we will see the wheel and realize the bolt is rusted Then you'll call out for me, 'Dakshinamurthy' repeatedly! - What do you suggest now? - Ask me now! Hey, come here! Listen what will we do now? Bought dry fish from your dad's shop let's go have a couple of drinks... Why hit me like this? You could have just ticked me off He'll again never follow our girl - Give him the money - Take it and run Shiva...don't go You damn girl! I feel sorry for you Your eldest daughter is unable to conceive The youngest is drunk all the time The one upstairs...all she does is keeps earning by acting! We have to spend for her mistakes! Is this what you call as family? - Good philosophizing! - Look how our family dignity is in tatters I thought my fame and fortune would make my family happy But the same fame and fortune has made you all into beasts! Even God can't reform or rescue you! - Come, father, let's go - Anjali...wait 'Everybody wanted my body for physical comfort' 'But the man I loved wanted my body for his life' 'This is what I call fate!' Manoj, what's the problem? Nothing, Anjali Tell me, whatever it is There is a long queue of producers and directors waiting to get your dates Despite all that when Velu and I asked you for your dates, you complied But we wasted that golden opportunity stuck with the wrong kind of producer Why do post mortem, Manoj? Tell me what happened, now? You are asking me to tell you what I'm trying to forget Please don't! What shouldn't I ask you? You are an upcoming director In the 10 days I've worked with you I liked your visuals and treatment I've worked in many films I loved your film This film should not stop for any reason Now I know the pain a director will feel if his film stops midway Maybe I should have worked as co-director instead All problems can be solved Tell me what you want Does the producer have any financial problems? - Nothing of that sort - I can produce a film with top stars He has the capacity to make 10 films at the same time! I'll finance the film Anjali is acting in But...1 condition - He has a different problem - Tell me what that is I don't have the heart to tell you What about your mother's dearest wish to see you as a famous director and... ...the team that's depending on you Can I forsake my conscience for that? Is the producer asking you to change your story? I'd have gladly obliged! No problem for money Story isn't the criteria What does he want? If you could set Anjali up with me for just one day...? - Tell me, Manoj - He wants YOU! How...tell me How I can ask you this? I thought I was reaping the benefits of 15 years of my hard work... I hold you in a higher position than my mother and all my closest friends No, Anjali If I should make you the sacrificial goat I don't want such a life, Anjali I might or might not get a producer But I don't want to lose a girl who loves me the way you do! If you get a call from your producer will you commence your shooting? You'll get a call from your producer by this evening Fix your shooting date All the best Our plan's succeeded She'll call you by this evening 'I thought I found a new meaning to my life' 'But even he back stabbed me' - Come, my dear director - Sit down Shooting is moving smoothly in top gear All because of sir's blessing! He is being generous You are spending lavishly Sit down, madam - Is he hero and director? - That's what he says now We'll know his worth when the film releases Looks like you are having a dig at someone - No, I am giving it straight! - Enough - She is madam of all madams! - Greeting madam - This is her sister - Sister? - Hello - Hello Nice to meet you His gaze is everywhere else but face! Drink it She looks like a heroine He's himself said it Made our work easier! Your words should come true right now Bring Anjali's role a few notches and upgrade my sister's role What are you looking like that for? You've had your fun, haven't you? Only is her wish is fulfilled your dream will come true Otherwise you'll remain a half-way director - My story will go for a toss then, sir - Only if there 'is' a story!' We can think again if a story gets muddled If a whole life gets messed up will mere thoughts set it right? We can inscribe all her dialogs and pray to her wise words! Forget it! If you do as I say and the film doesn't run I'll myself give you the next film to direct I am the investor and I am not worried Your job is to feel for feelings why are you feeling so bad? My sister is as lucky as 5 Simrans 6 Jothikas and 8 Anushkas! - 10 Kovai Saralas - You'll get slippered! Even if you pray to all your favorite Gods you can't get so many heroines to act ...or their mothers! Whatever it is, this film is half completed That's why I am thinking What new thought will you bring? In Ramayana, nothing spectacular about 14 years of being in exile After Valmiki's portrayal of Ravana Sita's imprisonment... ...and the war against Lanka brought out the human interest Similarly get her down as Anjali's rival in all areas! - Where did you get this allegory? - All comes in a flow You are thinking for a scene She has finished the entire script Only if you cast her as rival to the casting couch... ...will he download the money! Stop thinking Start doing!!! I have no choice I'll think of an idea "Won't fluffy clouds share secrets with the full moon when the sun sets?" "To dewdrops in bamboo forests won't the playful breeze gently caress?" "He captivates the heart sensuously Season cold, but body sweats profusely" "Lessons ache to satisfy a need Lustful thirst beckons with greed" "By just shooing away desire will it vanish into thin air?" "Won't fluffy clouds share secrets with the full moon when the sun sets?" "When the dew drops in bamboo forests won't the playful breeze gently caress?" "Without diving, pearl can't be picked Without fanning, a spark can't be kindled" "Without a teasing touch no treat in life as such" "What does a man need in a woman? What does a woman seeks in a man?" "When he and she merge together why would horoscope be a factor?" "No consulting date or time No deleting desire's need sublime" "If you and I become 'we' it is sheer bliss of infinity" "Fluffy clouds will share secrets with the full moon when the sun sets" "When the dew drops in bamboo forests the playful breeze will gently caress" "To get without asking is being lucky To gain of its own accord is lottery" "I was an immovable pillar Your moves made me surrender" "It's a sin to kill passion Lust wins over body's reaction" "Who is a good man night and day? What do your gray cells say?" "When the sun searches for the moon And moon looks for the sun to swoon" "A lifetime may end Will passion be spent?" "When Cauvery and Ganges meet isn't there a joyous union complete?" "When you and I unite won't everything feel right?" Manoj, please It's an emotional scene Look at mother and daughter seated under TWO huge umbrella Listen to me Are they the only ones who can have an umbrella? She is sitting with such arrogance! Even I have legs to cross and show off! Look at our man drooling Hey! You better come over here and sit quiet! I'll gouge your eyes if you look at her He doesn't realize your value We don't know what he's taking and why he's giving her importance Keep quiet, mother! Look at that! Look at her easy familiarity with him! Call that director over here Sister? Get down, don't sit on the chair Is this important? She has called for the director Why? To lessen your sister's role We shouldn't allow that What shall we do? Director is heading over there - Come here - Wait, I'll come back Why is your route changing? - Madam called for me - Then who is this? - No...hmmm... - Don't make excuses to me I propped up a movie that was in the doldrums Tell him, not me If it hadn't been for my daughter... ...there wouldn't have been an expectation meter for your film Very true Whose side are you on? There's truth in what she says also Are we lying all along then? You'd better ask him to uplift my sister's character with interest Otherwise I'll turn into a spirit and haunt you You need talent to be accepted as an actress If she is not well equipped then this is what she'll get That's not true You were briefed on all our conditions You nodded your head in agreement then Now you'd better defend us You too 'Yes' what? - You too were there - Yes, 'sister' Then why is he saying something else? - Why are you changing your line? - I didn't say anything Why...oh why? Don't magnify something very small Tell that pest of a female what you should really tell! I'll rip you apart I am not a female sitting tamed within 6 yards of my saree! I can take Goddess Kali's avatar Whoever opposes me I'll reduce them to ashes Mother, be quiet I'll make minced meat out of you Watch your tongue! I only look decent If I get into the arena I am adept at this as much as you are We can see that! You think I am a lifeless scarecrow! Or am a remnants of a beer cup? We are good at making and breaking people's future! We can lift up a head high and snip the tail completely Do you want your film to be released or not? - Definitely, madam - Then better listen to me I don't care how much money is spent I'll release in all areas and theaters Only my sister's name should come first Tell him that Pack up He's walking off calling it a day Are you a director or is he? And to think I trusted you! I blame myself Did you eat something that your body couldn't accept? - Is that why you are vomiting? - I'm vomiting 'cos it accepted! Who brought you to this condition? - Manoj - He's already running behind Anjali Did you do this of your own will or because he desired to do so? She ate something she couldn't digest That's why she's feeling so dizzy I could hear her vomit till the front door step! So don't try to hide the truth from me If he's close to her heart we should consult a doctor If he fights your conscience we should seek a lawyer We don't sue people and make a living out of it Yeah, they told me in Mount road You were sent as a chaperone What were you doing in the caravan? - Who did the misdeed? - Director Manoj Oh God! He came half way and did this damage also! He started the ball rolling She is bearing the brunt of it It is in your hands whether she should be... ...traditional worshipping lamp or a street lamp! You decide Do you know our lineage and ancestry You've spoilt my sister's life! - Only know too well! - Keep quiet, pencil! Forget what happened Figure out what to do now What did you to our girl? Why discuss that shameful affair all over again? Ask when he'll fix the wedding date - For you? - I'll kill you, ask him! - When can you marry her? - Movie is only half over, madam What's going on between you and Anjali? Nothing of that sort, sir I know her life like the back of my hand! That's why you made a deep impact! No, I was her friend and guide I was never her lover Not even once have I had such thoughts about her It came flooding in when you saw my sister I guess! If he was a good man shouldn't he have asked you... ...before his love-act! Finish the job first Appearances are deceptive Don't under-estimate my street-smartness! He'll disappear into thin air if I set my mind on it I have emerged from platform to bungalow You just now boasted of your royal family tree Don't bring to the floor words that rush out in a flow! - You mustn't go anywhere near Anjali - I won't, madam Only her mother... Why do you keep harping on her mother? I come from a family that pushed barrels into the sea and rowed them! I'll take care of the mother You take care of my sister Pencil, fix a good date consulting our priest His date has only made your sister pregnant! That was just one night You go fix an auspicious date Okay, sister - You got all that I said - I did I'm happy, madam Hello - Anjali? - Yes, you? - I am your fan - Feel happy to hear What is the matter? Whatever you wish for never happens What to do, it's your fate Who the heck are you? I'm having your best interests at heart And you are making me angry with your disrespect! What are you saying now? Your lover Manoj whom you claimed you carry in your heart Go and see who he is carrying in his heart! 'Today is the last day of shoot Last day of my hypocritical life' "The rainbow and rain in gladness shower and shine in blessedness" "If favor sought while hailed as 'mother' the earth will give an umbrella forever" "Clouds that paint the sky's canvas will jump in joy, close in to caress" "Sun will linger, not go to bed if I wink at him just before sunset" "Even flowers blooming for a day blossom only for me as a bouquet" "If I look for water to shower even Niagara will yearn to offer" Tomorrow shoot is at VGP The set is not ready here Tomorrow we'll meet at VGP Let's go 'Won't I get the death I wished for?' 'Today death won over me But tomorrow I'll get my way' "Enough if flowers worn on tresses strewn in the roads as a business" "Men in the streets will hurry promptly to quench their desires immediately" "Pillars in the temple with ornate sculpture Crave for my caress in total rapture" "Wealth in all forms I'll burn into ashes I'll sing unruffled whatever perishes" "In awe of me, both sun and moon appreciating my beauty duly swoon" "The rainbow and rain in gladness shower and shine in devotedness" "Whenever necessary, I'll be Vedanthangal bird sanctuary" "Changing my disguise cleverly I'll dance like the birds carefree" "I'll pour rain into a cup of tea I'll make daily calendar turn into money" "Summer changes to cold winter With a magic wand I am the creator" "I'll ask God Almighty to will me the Himalayas mighty" "The rainbow and rain in gladness shower and shine in devotedness" Anjali Take her in soon Anjali What happened to sister? Sister, look at me What happened to my sister? Madam Listen to me Wait Tell us without hiding the truth What's happened to Anjali? Did whole of Tamilnadu ask you to find out why? Why do you talk like this? She is fine Someone said she's linked to a politician? What have you not written about my daughter? People think it is love failure? Is that true? No film of her has a scene like this Anjali drank poison is the story that's going around Why are you hiding that? You are talking as if you made her drink poison... ...and you admitted her in hospital? Food poisoning due to late night dinner is the real reason She's being treated for it There's news that she was head over heels in love with Vinod earlier Is her link with the new director whose film she acted in, a fact? Do you have any more well fabricated questions? What's your final answer? My answer is all the same always You aren't going to write anything new Write whatever takes your fancy I am myself worried sick of my daughter's ill health You are trying to commercialize this Madam...madam...madam Are you done with your act? Mine? How can I act? I am a puppet in your hands In the puppet show of our lives I am a mere puppet controlled by you The thread is always in your hands Maybe you forgot to hold it tight I'd have been happy if I had died But you saved me, are you happy? Save all your dialogs that take a dig at me, in front of the camera! Don't act smart with me You tore my life into pieces How will you understand my pain? When you were dying for the next morsel of food... ...you had the will to live When you have everything now why should you die unnecessarily? That time teen age was my only problem Now everything is a problem for me That day you saw me as a daughter My siblings looked at me as their sister My father saw me as his child They genuinely loved me Today no one even looks at me as a human! I am just a money making machine to all of you It is years since you saw me as the child you gave birth to! Generally girls crave for love After I started acting not one day did I get that motherly love from you Your fault for keeping your heart so fragile as to seek solace! Only women who cannot live will seek care and concern An actress should have pride in her heart Ego and self worth should always be present You should be able to keep the man who loves you at the right distance Not become a puppet in his hands! Men should come flocking to you captivated for your beauty You shouldn't go and fall on them with your sob stories ...self pitying your past life or regretting your blunders Just say yes and I'll find the right groom for you Not all actresses will be blessed with fame, fortune, car, bungalow and comforts ...in such a short span But you, even though you are blessed by your ignorance you'll spoil your life ...and your peace of mind Not knowing an elephant's strength I won't make it beg for pittance I have the ability to make you the royal elephant You have the right qualification To you it is a treasure trove To me it is a grave Dead at heart and soul I am a zombie, mother Why are you such a she demon? Yes I am a she demon What I say goes as far as you are concerned! Why should I beg you? Take a few days rest I'm planning to sign 4 films for you You may be angel to all But I am your God Keep this in mind and take rest Don't philosophize to me 'Even strangers look at me with sympathy' 'Where as you as my own mother lack that empathy' 'Even death seems to reject me' 'For the 1st time I decided for myself satisfaction' 'Yes, I am a she demon' 'What I say goes as far as you are concerned!' I don't want to behave like a reporter in your life I want to behave like a woman I have appreciated and admired you as an actress But your diary made me respect you as a woman Let your life be a learning lesson to many actresses I won't hinder your new life God will always be with you Take care Subtitled by sraiyanti
