It's 3 o' clock in the morning I wish they get together. This is getting on my nerves. Henry, dear. But the convention isn't over yet. Yes, I am still at the convention. Can't you hear Mr. Clark speaking? Oh, Henry. I'll give you the money, but don't let it get near my wife. Ah, use your own judgment. I wish I'd never gotten mixed up in politics. No, honey. No, no. I tell you I haven't had one drink. But the convention isn't over yet. Oh, my. I know, Liza, but I can't come home till we nominate somebody. Well, you got to be home before Wednesday. The cow's going to have a calf. And you know she can't have that calf without you here. Ladies and gentlemen. The convention is still deadlocked. Suffering cats! These things are killing me. Haven't had 'em off in four days. Feels like I was born in 'em. - Why don't you take 'em off? - I can't get 'em off. I've tried every darned way under the sun. Why don't you cut 'em off? Do you ever think of that? Oh, I never thought of that. I've got an idea. It's worked before and it may again. Let's nominate a dark horse, one of White's dark supporters. Some hometown pride. If he only carries his own county he will split the White vote wide open and we'll win hands down. Great idea. Who will it be? Give me a list of those apple knockers from Menifee County. They're all White supporters. Here's the man, I don't know him but he's got a great name. Zachary Hicks of Menifee County. Pass the word out to all our delegates. Mr. Chairman. - Mr. uh.. - Jones of Clark County. Oh, yes. Mr. Jones of Clark County. Ladies and gentlemen, I see no hope of nominating either of the regular candidates so I wish to present a new name. A man whose slate is clean. A man who can pay the party standard to victory. A simple man who represents the great common people. The honorable Mr. Zachary Hicks of Menifee County. - Who is Hicks? - I've never even heard of him. - He's a new one on me. - Must be a dark horse. - How do you figure this? - Some kind of a dodge. The Wilson crowd are trying to steal our votes. They all know the Menifee County delegates are pledged to us. But they can't get away with it. We'll burn them with our own fire. Rather let them nominate Wilson we will nominate Hicks ourselves as long as White hasn't got a chance. No, I'd rather see a stranger get it than Wilson. - Quick, spread the word. - Yes, come on, get 'em. They'll never get away with it. - Who is he? - I've never heard of him. What? - Who is he? - I don't know. Ladies and gentlemen, the convention has nominated the Honorable Zachary Hicks of Menifee County. Can you imagine that? Those liars double-crossed us. - Who is this man Hicks? - I don't know. Hey! Wake up! Wake up! You've been nominated! You've been nominated! Nominated? Nominated for what? - For governor. - Who, me? - Yes, you. - You don't say. Try to look happy. Pretend we wanted him all along. Three cheers for Hicks. Well, I hope he didn't get lost. - Good morning. - Oh, there you are. Mr. Hicks, we want to prepare an immediate statement, uh, for the press giving your views and, uh, your biography. Well, I have views on all the important subjects of the day. But I don't think I have any biography. Telegram, Mr. Clark. Uh, take some notes on this will you please, Miss Russell? Uh, are you, uh, married, Mr. Hicks? No, never been married. No wife, no family. A-and no children either. But I belong to all the lodges. Uh, what political experience have you had, uh, Mr. Hicks? Well, the first office I ever held was County Corner. But I resigned from there. They were always getting me up in the middle of the night and I don't like to have my rest broken. Oh, yes, yes. I-I was chief of the fire department too. Here. I think I have a picture of myself here as chief. There. There. And, uh, now, Mr. Hicks uh, what are your views on the state issues? Well, I-I believe in government of the people.. ...for the people and, uh, by the people. Yes, that's a good doctrine and a new phrase too. Thank you. Will you pardon us just a moment, Mr. Hicks? Uh, go right ahead and relax. Uh, uh, we'll be right back. Uh, gentleman, if you please. You too, Miss Russell. Thank you. Did you ever see anybody so utterly stupid? That was a great idea of yours, to nominate a dark horse. He's dark enough, alright. Will you please not bring that up again? It has ceased to be humorous. Now there's no use to quarrel, gentlemen. 'It isn't the first time a fool was nominated to a political orders. Pardon me, gentlemen but I believe I can solve all your very obvious troubles. What? I know a campaign manager who can elect Hick's governor, believe it or not. Yeah, we're very busy now, Miss Russell. And you're also in a hole. You're sunk. Unless you do something drastic. Unless you get somebody who's a genius to come to your aid. And you know it as well as I do. Gentlemen, gentlemen. I-I just thought of an outstanding idea. Yes, Mr. Hicks. What is it? I would like to come forth on a platform against capital punishment. Mr. Hicks, capital punishment was abolished in this state six months ago. Oh, well, I'm glad to hear it. I always did think it should be done away with. Uh, well, I-I think I'll go back and relax some more. My, my feet still hurt me. Now perhaps you'll listen to me. If you were famishing on the desert and I brought you a drink of water wouldn't you take it? Why do you suppose I took this job here? Certainly not for the $35 a week. I'm capable of earning more than that in a day if I do say so myself. No, I wanted to get into your confidence so you'd believe me when I told you I could bring you the greatest campaign manager in the world. Well, who is he? Hal S. Blake. The S stands for Samson. That's just what he is. The best in the business. He knew you were were going to need him. That's why he sent me here weeks in advance. But he didn't know you were going to need him as badly as you do. Yes, well, the man must be a prophet. - Where is this wonder worker? - He's right here in this city. Well, get him up and let's have a look at him. He's terribly tied up just now. Yes, well, if he's that busy I don't see how he can do much for us. He could get out of his engagement if.. ...if you put up some money in advance. Uh, a sort of retainer. Yes, well, I never get bored of a pig in a poke. - Could we go to see him? - I think maybe we'll get in. Say, what is he, president of the United States? Miss Russell, let's stop all this mystery. Where is this man you speak of? Now, now take it easy, gentlemen. - He's in jail. - In jail, what? - In jail? - It's nothing serious though. - What's he in for? - Just alimony. - Are you his wife? - No, I'm not. If I were, he wouldn't be wasting his time in jail. Miss Russell, please be more specific. Just what has this Hal Blake done along publicity lines? He managed three campaigns for governor out west and had his man elected in every case. He's the greatest manipulator of public opinion this country has ever produced. He'll take that sleeping beauty in there and convince the voters he's the livest wire in public life. Just wait till you see him. You won't have anymore doubts. He can do more with words than Webster could. He's a human dynamo. I'll tell him we're coming. Hello, Joe, send a message to Hal right away. Tell him I'm bringing the campaign committee down to see him. Yes, right down to the jail. Oh, boy. Looks like eggs in the coffee again. His fingers have never been soiled by graft or intrigue. He's a man who can understand the plight of the underdog. A man who's made a study on the horrible condition of the jails in this state and who has pledged himself to reform those conditions. Gentlemen, gentlemen, my only regret is that I cannot go out and fight with all my strength to make sure that Zachary Hicks is the next governor of our glorious state. But even behind the bars of this cell I'll sing his praises through the roof. He's my friend. He's your friend. Our friend. The champion of the people. And that, gentlemen, is Hal S. Blake in flesh. The fastest worker in the world. Yeah, well, I don't take much stock in jailbird. - You don't, eh? - No. Do you ever hear of John Bunyan? He wrote "Pilgrim's Progress" in jail. And did you ever hear of Oscar Wilde? He wrote "The Ballad Of Reading Jail" in a worse hoosegow than this. The tune is "East Side West Side." Alright, now, boys. Sing it and give it a merry.. Upstate downstate cities and the sticks The voters yell for a change and even babies cry for Hicks Boys and girls together Toms and Harrys and Dicks Climb the big bandwagon While they cast their vote for Hicks Get this junk out of here. All of it, make this place look like something. Right, chief. Have an information desk put here. And a general sitting room out there. Get hold of the telephone company. Have them put a switchboard in here. I want a private line in my office. Right. And this sign, put that up on a wall. That's a good spot for it. - Say, fella, do you work here? - Oh, yes. I do in a way. - Then help put this sign up. - But I'm-- 'But? We don't want any slackers around here.' Everybody's got to work. This is a tough fight and we've got to win. Yes. Yes, of course. Get a good hold there. That's it, up on the chair. Up on the chair. Move fast, will you? Hurry up. Now, you balance it till I get up there. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. That's alight, sweet. It just shows how faithful you are. You're a no-good so-and-so. And now, Miss Russell, as a token of my affection and esteem, I've brought you a little coming out present. Oh, Hal, you shouldn't have. You know, you can't afford it. What do you mean I can't afford it? All my alimony paid up, a salary of 200 a week and a bonus of $50,000 when Hicks is elected. - You mean if Hicks is elected? - Same thing. There. Doesn't that look neat? Hal, you are as irresponsible as a baby. Don't you ever think of the future? Don't I? I've got it all planned out. We're going to be married right away. Now let's not start on that subject again, Hal. I've told you a thousand times I won't marry you. And I'm sorry, but I don't hear well. Why, sweet? You don't know what a lucky girl you are. To have Hal Blake in love with you and just panting to marry you. Think it's perfectly swell with Hal Blake in love with me but I don't think you'd be so kosher to be married with. Oh, listen, sweet, you're not selling Hal Blake short, are ya? As a sweetheart, no. But as a husband, I don't think you'll ever get on the big board. Won't you ever change your mind about me? Nope, because you never change. You're a born campaigner, darling. You run a great race. But when you win it, you lose all interest. If you ever caught up with me, I wouldn't be worth having. A successful husband has to stay put. I'll stay put, darling. I will hang on like a porous plaster. I know you too well, darling. Oh, I just got to keep chasing you, eh? I hope so. I love it. What's the matter with you? - Hold still. - My foot slipped. You ain't got sense enough to pour water on a hoot. That's no way to talk to me. Oh, I suppose you're the kind of fellow that can dish it out, but can't take it. "Vote for Hicks." They tell me this Hicks is a champion sea cow on this planet. Well, now I wouldn't say that. - 'You know him?' - Yes, I do. - 'What do you think of him?' - He's a very fine gentleman. You're wanted in the committee room, Mr. Hicks. Oh. Now, gentlemen, the big issue in this campaign is a wet and dry question. We've got to have both sides for us. Whenever we give out a dry statement we've got to let the wets know we're only playing politics and vice-versa. - Yes, but how? - Never mind, Mr. Green. Leave that to me. That's my business. Public opinion. Well, did you get that sign up? No, I didn't like the way that young fella talked to me. Oh, you didn't, eh? Well, what kind of a delicate sweet-smelling flower are you? But-but, Mr. Blake, uh, this is Mr. Hicks our-our candidate for governor. This is Mr. Blake, our campaign manager. Why, Mr. Hicks, I'm certainly glad to know you. I'm not going to apologize, my belief is that no job is too small to be done right. And I saw it at once that you are a man I could trust. A man of the people. Just like anyone of the hundred thousands that will vote for you next November. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Blake. - Yes, sir, governor. I can see that you have no false pride. - You're a true democrat. - Oh, thanks. You have simple, innate dignity. Ah, that's what I like. Say, we didn't get that sign up yet. I better go back there and help that young fella. Will you, gentlemen, excuse me? We don't want any slackers around here. So that's our candidate. He's a son of the people. - The son of the what? - A son of the people. When you say that, smile, brother. Well, what are gonna do, walk out on us, I suppose? Not a chance. Send him in here. Let me talk to him alone. - Oh, Mr. Hicks. - Yes? We got that sign up, Mr. Blake. Is there anything else I can do to help? That's the spirit, governor. Sit down. I wanna ask you a few personal questions and I want truthful answers. Of course. Did you ever kill anybody? Why, Mr. Blake, of course not. Don't get... Were you ever arrested? Oh, you know I never was. Well, I just wanted to be sure. Where you ever involved with a woman? Never in any wrong way. But I'm very fond of the fair sex, Mr. Blake. Uh, suppress it till after this campaign is over. Well, I'll try my best. - Did you ever steal any money? - I won't stand for this. I'll have you know I'm an honest man. That's great. An honest man. I believe you, governor. That's all I wanted to know. - Now then just one more thing. - Yes? If anybody asks you a question about anything no matter what it is, hesitate a minute. Make-believe you're thinking. Then say, uh, yes. And again, no. Yes. And again, no. Yes. - And again, no. - That's perfect. And till further notice, those are the only words you know. Now then, go home and memorize this. You mean, I should learn it all by-heart? Yeah. "I'm unknown to most of you. '"I was born and have ever remained 'in the most humble walks of life."' Well, what do you think of him? He's the dumbest human being I ever saw. Every time he opens his mouth he subtracts from the sum total of human knowledge. - Well, what are we gonna do? - That's simple. We're going to capitalize his dumbness. You mean, you're going to openly admit it? Admit it? We're going to shout it from the housetops. We're going to make him even dumber than he is. We're going to convince the voters that at last they're getting one of their own kind to represent them. Honest and dumb. That's the bill of goods we're gonna sell and it's a bill that can't fail. Sure, he's dumb, but he's honest. A square shooter, on the level. A man like your next-door neighbor. We'll admit he hasn't got a voice like Bryan or an education like Woodrow Wilson but he's honest and he'll give the people a square deal. And believe me, that's what the public wants in these days of corruption and depression. Well, that's common sense. Gentlemen, we're as good as elected. And now I've got a lot of things to do. - Oh, Mr. Jones. - Yes, sir. Will you engage the legal firm of Cadwallader, Fleet and Gladstone? I want to bring suit against our opponent the Conservative candidate. A lawsuit that will humiliate and ruin him in the eyes of the public. Lawsuit? What for? Uh, well, I haven't decided yet. Progressive Headquarters. Mr. Blake is very busy now. Will you leave your number? Thank you. Progressive Headquarters. The governor's tied up in conference. Thank you. Sorry, you can't see Mr. Blake now. - I've got to see him. - Back in an hour. That's right, come back in an hour, fine. Sorry, gentlemen, Mr. Blake can't be disturbed now. You suppose we could get in later? Well, he has a pretty full schedule. Now as soon as he finishes in here he has an appointment with the drys. Then at 4:00, he's conferring with the wets. At 4:30, the vivisectionists. At 5:00, anti-vivisectionists. 5:30, he has a meeting with the reform element and at 6:00, with the slot machine group. Then he's having dinner at the Republican Club and after that, he's going for a smoke with the Democrats. Who has he got in there now? It's confidential. Very, very important. No, no, no. Now let's try it again, governor. I'm getting awfully tired, Mr. Blake. But you don't know the speech yet. Now, now, once more. "I am unknown to most of you. "I was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life." Now just the way I did it. "I am unknown to most of you. "I was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life." That's the idea. "I have no wealthy or popular relations or friends to recommend me--" No, no, no, no. That's not exactly the facts, Mr. Blake. Now what's wrong with it? Well, I have an aunt who owns a big farm upstate. Aunt Fanny. Oh, don't worry about Aunt Fanny. We'll keep her in the background. Well, I just wanted you to know. Yeah, alright, and now, and now, let's get on with it. "My case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the country." Now change that to state. "My case is thrown exclusively "upon the independent voters of the country. - Change that to state." - No, no, governor. Just say the independent voters of the state instead of the country. Oh, oh, oh, I understand. Yes. Now here we are. "And if elected, they will have conferred a favor upon me which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate." "And if elected, they will have conferred a favor upon me for which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate." "But if the people in their wisdom shall see fit "to keep me in the background "I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined." Now, when you come to that passage walk over to the edge of the platform. Look out into the audience, and raise your hand like this. "But if the good people in their wisdom shall see fit.." Not nervous, are you, governor? - No. - Smile, look pleasant. Ladies and gentlemen we are to have a joint debate on the issues of this campaign between the honorable William A. Underwood the Conservative candidate for governor. And on the other side the honorable Zachary Hicks, the Progressive candidate. "I am unknown to many of you. "I was born and have ever remained "in the most humble walks of life. "I have no wealthy or popular relations "or friends to recommend me. "My case is thrown exclusively "on the independent voters of the state. "And if elected, they will have conferred a favor on me "for which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate." Hey, Mr. Chairman. I rise to a point of order. Mr. Underwood has the floor. I demand to be heard. Ladies and gentlemen, lend me your ears. In the name of reason, let me speak! I only ask a minute. Just one minute, I promise you. That was a great speech Mr. Underwood was making. It'll always be a great speech. It was a great speech when Abraham Lincoln first made it. I am a great admirer of Abraham Lincoln myself and I'm never without a copy of his words of wisdom. This book contains some of Honest Abe's speeches. Look, ladies and gentlemen, "Speeches Of Abraham Lincoln." Mr. Chairman, gentlemen. Let me read one of them to you. "I am unknown to many of you. '"I was born and have ever remained' '"in the most humble walks of life.' '"I have no popular or wealthy relations' or friends to recommend me." Did you ever hear that before? "My case is thrown exclusively upon the independent voters of the country." Change that to state. Silence, please. "And if elected "they will have conferred a favor upon me which I shall be unremitting in my labors to compensate." Does that sound familiar? I dislike to accuse Mr. Underwood of plagiarism and yet I think it hardly likely that Abraham Lincoln stole that speech from Mr. Underwood. Ladies and gentlemen, let's look at the situation. On the one hand, we have a candidate committing the vilest of crimes. Filching thoughts from a dead man's grave. But on the hand, we have a true son of the people. A fighter from the headwaters of Battle Creek. Brave as a lion, true as steel honest as the day as long and bright as the lark at the first blush of day. But don't look at the candidate, look at what he stands for. Boys, let's give three rousing cheers for the next governor. We can hardly have a debate with only one side represented. Mr. Underwood had to keep an engagement at the public library with Abraham Lincoln. Well, I propose that we end this meeting by singing our campaign song. Come on, Joe. Let's have it. Upstate downstate cities and the sticks The voters yell for a change and even babies cry for Hicks Boys and girls together Toms and Harrys and Dicks Climb the big bandwagon While they cast their vote for Hicks Where are those sweet, young ladies' voices? 'Come on, let's have it.' Upstate downstate cities and the sticks The voters yell for a change and even babies cry for Hicks Boys and girls together Toms and Harrys and Dicks Climb the big bandwagon While they cast their vote for Hicks Boo, boo. Oh, what a lovely bull. - Well.. - Will you tie it on, governor? Why, certainly. Ah, get this boys. Will you please stand still, governor? Look this way and smile, governor. Smile, that's it. That's fine, boys, but after this please photograph the governor from the left side. His profile is better on the left. Mr. Hicks, my paper would like to get your views of the Japanese question. Do you think we should intervene in the far East? Well, uh, yes, and again, no. I don't quite understand, governor. Well, just, uh, yes, and then again, no. Come along, governor. We've got another town to make. - Okay, okay. - Okay, chief. Now get this boys. Aloka. I hereby proclaim you honorary chief of this tribe. - 'That's fine, boys.' - Thanks, chief. I hope to be able to do as much for you someday. Well, Mr. Hicks, what about Prohibition? Are you a definite dry or a wavering wet? Yes, and again, no. What's that? Yes, and again, no. Yeah, thanks. Now wait a minute, boys, wait a minute. We got all the afternoon. Here, governor. Now hold her up. Oh, come on. Strike a pose. That's the boy. Alright, boys. Camera. That's fine, boys. That's fine. Something? I'd like to speak to Mr. Blake. The lady will take care of you. - It's Maybelle. - Maybelle? Well, what's the matter with her now? She just got her alimony. No, but I let it slide again for a couple of weeks. And she bought the house down for $2. Why did you ever give drunk and let that dame marry you in the first place? Oh, stop asking foolish questions. Go out there and stall her off. No, no. No, no, no, no. Sorry, Mr. Blake doesn't answer. I'll wait. Why, Maybelle, well, of all people I'm certainly glad to see you, darling. How have you been? Lay it in there, honey. - I've just gotta have it. - Where is he? Oh, you mean Hal? Oh, haven't you heard? Heard what? Come on, you know his aunt Julia. - Yes, what about her? - Poor soul, she died. - Really? - Just yesterday. Left the whole farm to Hal, you know, that farm. - Yes, I've been up there. - Oh, Hal's up there now. He's having it surveyed. Gonna have it cut up into town lots. Oh, he'll make a million dollars out of it. Oh, it's a cinch. Then maybe he'll be able to pay his alimony on time for once in his life. Alimony? Listen. He'll make a cash settlement with it that'll curl your hair. Now, listen, Maybelle. You know, that I've always been a good friend to the both of you and I want you both to have all the good luck in the world. Would you take a little friendly tip from me? - If it doesn't cost anything. - You're smart. Now why don't you just soft pedal for a little while? Be nice. You know yourself without me telling you. You can catch more flies with molasses than you can with cyanide. - What are you selling? - Nothing. But if you don't bother him about the alimony he'll give you three times what's coming to you. Oh, I'll bet my life on that against the rotten egg. That makes the odds even. Attagirl, that's how I like to hear you talk just like your old self. - When will he be back? - Well, a week at the latest. Alright, I'll take a chance. You ought to be right once in your life. Oh, just take my word for it. Everything's gonna be alright. And I'll tell Hal how nice you were when he gets back. So long. I'll be back next week and he better be here. - Goodbye, darling. - Toodle-oo. Oh. Can I be of any service to you, madam? Why, governor? I didn't recognize you at first. You're so much better-looking than your photograph. - All the ladies tell me that. - I'm sure they do. Did they take good care of you in there? Oh, I just wanted to see Mr. Blake and he isn't in. Not in? Who told you that? 'I just had a conference with the man a moment ago.' Oh, governor. Some stupid person told me he wasn't here. Ridiculous. I'll take you right into him. Oh, that's very sweet of you, governor. It'll be a great pleasure. Come right along with me, little lady. - Would you like an apple? - No, thank you. Oh, he must be busy uh, but I'll take you around through my private door. Hal, if I live to be ten millions years old I'll never understand how you got hitched to a wagon like that. There he is. Didn't I tell you? How do you do? Well, this is a pleasure. If it hadn't been for me, you wouldn't have seen her at all. Th-they told her you weren't here. They told me you'd gone up to the farm. How stupid! Thank you, governor. So nice of you. - No trouble at all. - Yes, uh. Mighty nice of you, even I'll do as much for you sometimes. Oh. Forget it. I'm heartbroken to hear about Aunt Julia. - Oh, now, Maybelle-- - Don't Maybelle me. - I want my money. - Oh, Maybelle, please. If you'll only be patient, if you'll just wait till next-- I won't wait till you draw your breath. The only way I ever get any money from you is throw you in jail and that's what I'm going to do now. - Back you go. - Shh. You'll be there inside of an hour and this time I hope you rot in there. You can't floss me around like this. I won't stand for it. Maybelle, please you'll ruin me around here-- Then give me my money! I'll pay you, I'll pay you, I'll pay you. Well, that's more like it. Well, come on, cough up. Well, what I meant was it, uh, I'm going to get a bonus when I win this election and I'll make a big cash settlement on you then. You expect me to believe that. If you think you can bull me again, you're crazy. Why don't you pay what you owe? Alright, alright. Here it is, I.. Hmm, well, that's something like. Say, you're 400 short. I know, but, uh, that's shows my heart's in the right place, darling. I hate paying on the installment plan-- You're not paying on the installment plan you're going to pay it now, every cent of it. I demand my money now, now, now! Shh. I'll get it. I'll get it. 'I'll give you just 60 seconds.' Shh, I'll get it. What's the matter? You look pale. Do I? That's funny. I must have shaved too close. Well, what a busy little bee you are. Sent out 5000 letters this morning. Went to every plumber in the state. Well, that's fast work. Oh, I, uh, I hate to do this, honey but, uh, I've got to ask a little favor of you. What is it, dear? I've gotta have just $400 for the next few days. Now what did you promise mama? I know, sweet, but I just haven't got everything cleared off yet. What's this for? Oh, just a little bill I overlooked. They're threatening to make trouble if I don't pay it right away. Well, I'll let you have this, Hal but I do wish you'll get everything straightened out so you wouldn't have to be worrying all the time. Oh, sure. I've reformed, honey. I'm half scotch now. What's the other half? White rock or ginger ale? Oh, thanks, sweet. I'll pay you back on Saturday. Will you give me a $400, please? Here you are, my dear, let me tell you how much I appreciate the charming way you handled the whole affair. And let me tell you that if you get behind again you'll go right back to that can without any fuss or feathers. Thanks so much. I never like to go to the can with fuss or feathers. So it was you. Nobody else. And I got it. - Oh, girls. - Give me that money. Oh, Joe. Hey, Joe. Oh, Maybelle. Hey, Maybelle, Maybelle. Come away, please. Remember, you're a lady. What's the matter-- - Take your hands off me. - Wait a minute, lady. Wait a minute, Maybelle, wait a minute. Remember, you're a lady. Let go of me, you weasel! Now you will go to jail. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, honey. I wouldn't have had this happen for anything. No, no, no, don't. Why don't you be reasonable? No, no, no. No, Maybelle. I want to speak to Judge Burroughs, Room 62. This is Mrs. Blake. - Joe, have you got any money? - Oh. There, that's $20. Wait, now wait a minute. Wait. There, there's five more. Well, wait, wait, wait. Here, here, here. There's two and a half more. What, is, is that all you got, Joe? Oh, here, wait a minute. Here's, uh, here's 75 cents. Hello, judge. How are you? This is Mrs. Blake. Oh, please. Give me till tomorrow, Maybelle. I can raise the money. I'm afraid you'll have to serve that arrest order, judge dear. Yes, he's in his office now. Now maybe you'll start digging. - No, no, no, Maybelle, look. - You can't have him arrested. - What good's a fellow in jail? - He can't give you a dime. You better start digging, boys. - I'll get you your cut. - We're gonna get $50,000. Come on, darling. What's good a guy in jail? - Better star digging, boys. - There's love and affection. What good is Hal in jail, Maybelle? Can't you see him-- - Better start digging. - Cold, bleak, damp place. This package just came, Miss Russell. Thanks. If you just give me an hour, I'll sell my car I'll pawn watch.. - Thanks, my dear. - Oh, honey, you saved my life. Call that lawyer quick. Tell him to cancel that arrest order. Sure. Now, Maybelle, uh, you can give me back my money. - 27.50. - That'll apply on next week. Hello. This is Mrs. Blake again. You can tell Judge Burroughs to never mind about that arrest order. I've got the money. Goodbye. I'll be seeing you next week, Hal dear. Bye-bye. Okay. May I see you a moment, please? What a lovely young lady that was, Mr. Blake. Get away from me, you lunkhead, before I brain you. Why, Mr. Blake? Kay. - For Miss Russell. - Yeah. This is the right place. Well, what is it now? Mr. Blake sent you some more flowers, Miss Kay. I told you not to accept any flowers from Mr. Blake. Well, there ain't no need to let them go to waste, Miss Kay. Now, understand, Miss Lavini, if anymore flowers or presents come from Mr. Blake you're not to let them in the house. Yessum, but he's a mighty nice man. I'll make my own decision on the desirability of suitors. - What's that you say? - Never mind. But ain't you never gonna let him come here no more? Nope, and stop asking questions. Yes, ma'am. One of the nicest white man I ever did see. Hello. Yeah, sir. Oh, I'll tell her. Your father's comin' up. What? I didn't know father was in town. - Have we extra chop? - Yes, ma'am. Go fix a nice dinner for him then. - You bet.. - I'm so glad he's come. - Father. - Daughter. I thought I told you not to come here anymore. I know, darling, but I couldn't stand seeing you unhappy. You.. Oh, that tickles. I tell you, gentlemen, it looks bad. Look at these. Hicks, Hicks, Hicks. That's all you read in the papers. Hicks' Judges Beauty Contest. Hicks Endorses Fresh Air And Sunlight. Hicks Descended From Paul Revere. What are you gonna do, Mr. Black? I've got an ace in the hole. You better play it soon. Election is only a week off. Just hold your horses. They've got both the wets and the drys for him. That fellow Blake has organized all the bootleggers and that girl of his has organized all the temperance people. They've even got the street cleaners behind him by promising to pass a law prohibiting circus parades. Pardon me, gentlemen. How do you do, Mrs. Blake? - I'm Mr. Black. - How do you do, Mr. Black? I suppose you're curious as why I asked you to call. Naturally. There's something I'd like to discuss with you. - It's rather important. - Important to who? You or me? - I hope to both of us. - Oh, I'm listening. We happened to know, Mrs. Blake that you are a very good friend of Mr. Zachary Hicks the Progressive candidate for governor. Well. On last Friday afternoon, Mr. Hicks had shall we say, tea with you. On last Saturday, Mr. Hicks had shall we say, dinner at your apartment. And on last Sunday night, Mr. Hicks played shall we say, bridge with you till 2:30 in the morning. Say, where do you come off having me followed? Now don't get excited, Mrs. Blake. - We don't mean you any harm. - What's this all about, anyway? You may not know it, Mrs. Blake but good fortune is knocking at your door and you have an opportunity to be of great public service. And incidentally, do a little favor for yourself. Won't you sit down? Can we talk? You got a cigarette? Why, of course. Here's to you, honey child and to the Honorable Zachary Hicks the next governor of the state the finest flower of the Old South. And here's to you, Hal. Well, by this time tomorrow night, we'll know. It's in the bag, we can't miss. It'll be a landslide. And do you realize that by this time tomorrow we'll have $50,000 right in our hands? It'll be marvelous. I hope you'll take care of it this time, Hal. I'll arrange a cash settlement on that charming ex-wife of mine. What a relief it'll be to get rid of her for the rest of my life. What are you going to do with the balance of it? I've got a brilliant idea about that. I'm going to turn it over to you to keep from me. - Oh, I couldn't do that. - Why not? Who'd have a better right to it than Mrs. Hal Blake? Who said I was going to be Mrs. Hal Blake? Oh, no, darling, you don't mean to say you're still going to hold out? I tell you, I'll make you the best husband in captivity. I won't be a husband at all, I'll be a sweetheart. But I want you to be Mrs. Hal Blake. I'm proud of you and I want everybody to know you belong to me. Kay, if you'll marry me, I'll settle down and be a responsible citizen. I love you that much. Say you will. - You almost persuade me. - Say you will. Never mind the phone. Say you will. Well, I'll, I'll think about it seriously. Hello? Hello, Joe. Yes. Yes, Hal's here? It's Joe and he sounds terribly upset. Hello, Joe. What's up? Listen, Hal, you've got to come right away. Something terrible has happened. Yes, what is it? Well, I can't talk over the phone. I'm in a public booth. But you've got to come right away. It's serious. Oh, alright, I'll come. Where are you? Okay. - What's the matter? - I don't know. Some kind of a jam. But tell me before I go that you'll marry me. You'd better hurry up. Joe sounded terribly upset. I'm not going till you say yes. - Hal, it's important. - This is more important. I'm not going to budge from this spot till you say you'll marry me. You big baby. And you will? You better go, dear. I'll only be gone a few minutes. And don't you move till I get back. I'll be here. It, it was lovely of your aunt Caroline to invite us up here over the weekend. I wouldn't think of going if we didn't have a proper chaperone like her. She's a dear. I thought I'd never get away from that fellow Joe. He follows me around like a keeper. How stupid. As if you couldn't take care of yourself. - You know how I ditched him? - Oh, tell me, sugar. I crawled out of the lavatory window. You old fox. You.. Oh, well, what happened? They framed Hicks with a woman. You lamebrain, I told you to stay with him. Well, I've done everything but sleep with him. Well, you should have done that too. Where is he now? He has a cabin at Silver Lake Lodge with this woman. How do you know? I got all the dope from the telephone operator. Well, we've got to stop him. Come on. I hate to leave you alone, sugar. Oh, forget it. Uh, Dunkirk, 3600. Black, I've got the old warthog with me. He fell for that Aunt Caroline's story like I thought he would. We'll be at the lodge in an hour. Goodbye. Just wait till you see the morning papers. Hicks Caught In A Love Nest. That'll end the Progressive Party, alright. Come on, boys. Come on, step on it. Plane for Silver Lake Lodge. Lots of planes here, but the pilots are all off-duty now. Well, how do we get one? Well, I'll, I'll try to find one that's home. Silver Lake Lodge. Charming place. You're going up there to catch yourself some fish? Yeah. A big sucker. Well, I don't know about the suckers but I caught a lot of trout up there-- Get us a plane, the devil or the fish. I don't think there's been a sucker caught up there in years. Can you hurry that thing a little bit? - Mr. Jones? - Uh, yeah, yes. Uh, your cabin is just down the road, sir. Oh, fine. - Will that be all, Mr. Jones? - 'Huh? Oh, yes.' - Yes, that's all. - Any, uh, any ice water? No. Oh. - Thank you, Mr. Jones. - Oh, forget it. It was clever of you to register under a false name. Can't be too careful, a man in your position. Aunt Caroline has the adjoining bungalow but we won't have to bother her until morning. Well, as long as she's practically under the same roof as us and we've got separate rooms there's nothing to worry about, I guess. Of course not. You know, boys, she'll give us a signal with the window shade after she hears our auto horn. That's your cue to break in. Be sure and get a good picture of me when I make the arrest. It'll be great for our local paper. Okay, sheriff, but stand close to the next governor. There. Now the place looks more home-like. Yes. It seems like we're in a world all our own. - Just us two. - Wanna play some cards? Well, I'm not much of a hand at cards. Besides, I think I'll turn in. I'm sleepy from the long ride. Oh, but you do play poker. Yeah. Well, I don't like it much. Oh, then you never played strip poker. 'There's a game.' Strip poker? - How do you play that? - Uh, just regular poker. Only instead of the bets the loser has to take off some garment. 'It's lots of fun.' Oh, I see. Now there's some sense to that. Make it as fast as you can. - Pair of tens. - You win again. I haven't got a pair. Lucky at love, unlucky at cards. I can't understand all the bad luck I'm having tonight. Well, it can't last forever. I better get a hand pretty soon. Your deal. Which way is the lodge? Right up there, about a quarter of a mile. Okay. Any cards? Yes. You better give me three. I want three too. Pair of deuces. Pair of sevens. I certainly am lucky tonight. I've been having the same kind of luck pitching those shoes. I get 'em up that close, but somebody else always gets a little closer. - Now don't give up hope. - Well, deal 'em again. Uh, which cabin is Mr. Hicks in? Sorry, no Hicks on the register. Listen, Joe, you look in that cabin and I'll look in this one. Is he in there? No, but come on, take a peak anyway. Come on. - Awfully hot in here. - Yes, it is warm. Wonder what's the matter with this shade? - There they are. - Let's hustle. Come on, boys. Hold it up. No, don't please. You know what to do, boys. Here they come. Uh, let me go. Let me go, I've got to get my clothes on. You.. I-I.. Get out! Get him out of here from the back door. Come on, Zachary. Come on. Let him go, Maybelle, let him go. Come on, Zachary, get out here. Let him go. Maybelle, take your hands off him. Let him go. Come on, governor. - Hurry up, governor. - Wait, wait. You can't stop or rest now. I gotta put on my shoes. I'll catch cold. - Here, put this one on. Quick. - Where's my hat? Here's your hat. Well, hurry. Hurry up. Come on, governor. Hurry up. Hurry up. Come on, Hicks, open up! It's the law. 'Hicks! Hicks! Open that door!' 'It's the law.' What do you ruffians mean by breaking in like this? 'Is there no privacy in America?' Has the time passed when a man's home is his castle? When you smash in my door the laws of America crashed around our heads. This is outrageous! Is there nothing safe? Nothing sacred? Our forefathers fought and died for their sanctity of the home and the chastity of their women. Civilization was cradled around the fireside. The ancient tribes gather there in safety and seclusion. And now after all those sweat and blood and tears that have lead mankind up till the 20th century to have it all toppled over by a nest-building baboon like you. Now don't be so fresh, young fella. - I've got a warrant. - A warrant, for whom? For John Doe, for anybody breaking the law. How dare you mention the law when your very appearance is a misdemeanor. A smart cracker, eh? Well, we'll see how smart you'll crack in jail. "For violation of the Mann Act? For taking a woman across the state line?" Say, is this place across the state line? Yes, by a 100 yards, wise guy. So our glorious country has come to this. A man must go to jail for being with his own wife. Huh? Wife? Yes, wife. Mrs. Halpin S. Blake. Legally married. Look up the records. Now, listen, mister, I know who you are looking for. Know all about it. You're trying to jump somebody. You cheap, political cutthroat. Well, you didn't. You're trying to defeat an honest, upstanding man that nothing can stop. Now get out and stay out if you know what's good for you. Come on, governor. Almost there. Head over the fence. I'm caught, help me. Don't let a little thing like a four ply string worry you. Wait a minute. Wait a minute, will you? - Be quiet, be quiet. - I got this. Someone will hear ya! Oh, man, I got this thing caught in one of my legs! Oh, come on, governor, please be quiet, will you? We don't wanna hear.. So you thought you could double me, did you? You got an awful goal trying to double anybody. I'd like to be in your shoes when you try to collect for tonight's work. But don't think you are through with me. I'm through with you? A thousand ways, I'm through. Uh, let me tell you another thing. Don't think you're ever going to marry that little worm of a secretary. - You leave her out of it. - Ah. So that strikes home, does it? Now I know where to hit you. I wanna make you wish you were dead. You've done that for a long time. I married you when I was cockeyed just after I put over a big deal. From the very start, you chiseled on me. Now I'm on the bandwagon again and because you are not in with me, you're trying to ruin me. But you didn't succeed. This time tomorrow, they'll be counting the votes. And the first thing the new governor will sign will be a deportation order for you! Well, hello, Black. Well, fancy seeing you here. What a coincidence? How've you been? - Just a minute, mister. - Oh, what's up, now? - You're under arrest. - Oh, stop clowning. You're not married to that woman. Oh, I've been married to her. Makes no difference. You are not now. It's still a violation of the Mann Act. Come on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I will.. That's alright. We've been reconciled. We're going to be remarried. Aren't we, darling? - Why, of course. - See? Now, you fellows, clear out and stop annoying me. He hates her worse than poison. He'd go to jail to avoid marrying her. If you're sure you're so reconciled we'll send for a justice of the peace and have the ceremony performed here and now. But, uh, but we wanted to be married at the little church around the corner for sentimental reasons, you know. We, uh, we were married there the first time. Oh, I think it'll be nice to be married right here. This is such a lovely place. Oh, but, darling, I wouldn't feel that we've been married if we, if we weren't married at the little church around the corner. Oh, I don't know, sweetheart. I think I'd like to change. No, but, sweetheart, wouldn't it be nicer to, uh to wait until after the election tomorrow? Oh, no, dear, let's get married tonight and then we can celebrate both victories. But, uh, dear, you know I wanted to have a big wedding with all my friends there. Say, how much of this have I gotta listen to? Come on, mister, it's either marriage or jail. Now make up your mind. Think fast, bright boy. Ow! Get out, get out this way. That's it. Ow, wait a minute. Uh, l-lift up little bit. Take it easy. Oh, take it easy. There you are. Oh, I'll never forget this night as long as I live. Look at me. I'm cut to ribbons. Thank goodness, I brought this suitcase with me. - Oh, Governor Hicks. - Oh, take me home. - Take me home. - Put this nightgown. - Be careful. - We gotta get out of here. Be careful. I'm being as careful as I can. This is a nightgown, you know. Well, governor, now you're a sure thing for the Ku Klux Klan vote. Come on, let's get going. Do you take this woman for your lawful wedded wife? Yeah. Yeah, I do. You take this man for your lawful wedded husband? I should say I do. Then I pronounce you man and wife. May I be the first to congratulate the bride? Mr. Blake, congratulations. I wish you much happiness. Yes, doctor. Well, I tried that several times but it's so unhandy. Yes. I will. Bye-bye. Oh, uh, good morning, Kay. What happened to Hal last night? I never heard another word from him. Oh, Hal's fine. Fine. He had some confidential work to do. - What? - Well, uh, you see, uh.. Hicks got in a jam with a woman. - Hal had to get him out. - Who is the woman? I don't know. Some dame they hired to frame Hicks. Now, listen, Kay, don't run out and don't get excited till I explain. Make it snappy and very convincing. I had to do it. They got me in between. There, uh, there was nothing else I could do. - Just what did you do? - Well, you see, I-- We got married. Is that true, Hal? - Well, in a way. - What way? With a license and all the trimmings. After last night I knew something like this would happen. Oh, well, now, Kay, listen to me. Listen to me. You know, I don't love that dame. I had to marry her to keep him going to the penitentiary. You know you're the only woman in my life. I will get rid of her if I had to strangle her. There's only one thing in my life that means anything to me and that's you. Please listen to me. Please-- Please don't follow me anymore. Look, Hal. Look at this. Read it. This campaign makes you a national figure. Oh, come on, Hal. Snap out of it. Listen, Joe. Let's try once more. You call Kay up and see if she'll talk to you. Sure. Is Miss Kay Russell there? She's leaving town? What station? Oh, you don't know. Well, how long ago? Thanks. She left the apartment a half an hour ago, baggage and all. Let me speak to the chief of police right away. This is Hal Blake speaking. Hurry, it's important. Hello, Coleman Company? Let me speak to the manager. - Hal Blake talking. - Hal Blake talking. Don't argue with me, put him on. Don't argue with me, put him on. Hi, sweetheart. You've come back to me. What is all this razzle-dazzle? Having me arrested. Why, lady, we've been telling you all the way up here. He says you abandoned a child. Abandoned a child? What child? Why, me, darling. You always said I was just a baby? You and your tricks. Abandoned a baby. Well, you're gonna be abandoned from now on. Oh, no, that's no way to talk, honey. We've got to stick together. Through think and thin, through fire and water. You'll get everything I've got. Me, my love and $50,000. You forget you're married. Oh, but, darling, we can't let a little thing like marriage come between us. Good work, boys. Good work. Mr. Blake will take care of you. Sure, sure. With a new administration, why not? Here it is, honey? Well, what of it? Why don't you understand, sweet? Nevada. Reno's in Nevada. We'll go out there and in six weeks, I can get a real divorce. And there won't be any alimony this time. I've got enough on Maybelle to hang her. And this time, I won't be so easy. If she squawks, I will hang her. Please say you'll go with me, honey. Please say it. Another chance to give me the runaround, hm? No, there aren't going to be anymore runarounds. From now on, everything is going to be happy days in Dixie. We'll be married out West and maybe buy a ranch out there and get out of this kind of business. And you know, I, I couldn't run a ranch without you. You great, big, overwhelmed baby.
