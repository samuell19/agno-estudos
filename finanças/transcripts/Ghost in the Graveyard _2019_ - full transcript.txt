Satan. Satan. I look back now and it all seems like a dream. A nightmare, really, that I have never quite woken up from. To this day, she still haunts me and I think she always will. But back then we were just kids playing a kids' game and somehow it all went wrong. - Sally! - Sally! Come on, Sally. We wanna go home, come on! It's getting cold. It's not funny anymore, I wanna go home! She's up here. I wanna go home. Sally! Sally! Sally! Come on, come out! Sally, where are you? Where is she? It's not a game anymore! Sally! Sally. This is not a game! We're done playing. Is she up there? This isn't funny anymore! Come out! Is she up there? Let's go find out. Sally's it! Run! Here she comes! Go! Run! Ghost! Martha! Only because I fell. Yeah right. Where's Martha? Martha? Martha? Marth... Martha? Martha? Billy! Billy, come on! Someone help! Martha, come on! Please! Hey, Mr. Sullivan! Thanks, Tommy. Is she home yet? - No, not yet. - Hey. She's gonna be okay. Is she gonna stay this time? Why don't you ask me yourself? Look who it is. Wow. It's good to have you home. Welcome back. Thank you. Give me that. Take her box upstairs. You want some tea? - I just boiled some water. - Yeah. All right. Oh. You know, I always liked that kid, Reed. Oh yeah? Yeah, you should call him. Why would I call him? Why would anybody call anyone who cares that way about someone else? Okay, stop, you're crazy. I'm just saying that, you know, he stuck by you through a lot of this stuff and it ain't because you guys are friends. We're close friends but we've just always been friends. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Sure, whatever you say but I'd, I'd suggest you stop staring at his picture then. - I just found it in a box. - All right. - Just checking it out. - I believe you. I believe you. Good luck with that. Can you go away now? Okay, goodbye. Let's take the shortcut. What're you, crazy? I would never go through here. Yeah, that little dead girl supposedly haunts it. My dad says there's no ghost. Oh, well, then if there's no ghost why don't you ride through it? Don't do it, man. Come on, Tommy, don't make me dare you, please? I'm not afraid. Hey, sweetie. Did you happen to get the newspaper? No, I didn't, but I did make the coffee. Wow, it's nice having you home. Oh, I got it. - Hey. - Hi, Sally. Can I come in? Yeah, of course, come on in. Good to see ya. Well hello there, Mr. Hugglesworth. Oh, hey, Mr. Sullivan. How're you doing, Reed? Good, good, you? Good, good, how is everything? Parents are doing fine. You probably know better than I do. Senior year, Sally's back, I mean, what's not to like about it? Uh, So I was thinking I would take Sally to school today. If that's all right with you. That's very sweet of you, Reed. Isn't that nice, huh, Sally? Yeah, she appreciates it. Guys, I'll be right back. Hey, hey, hey, hey. We got this. I'm on it. You go out there and be a kid, okay? This is your last bit of it, all right? All right. Bring it in. Thank you. All right, well, you ready? Ready. It was great seeing you again. - You too, Reed. - Bye, Dad. See ya. Bye, Billy! See you guys. Freak show is back. And she's all over Reed. I thought she was "Mrs. Innocent." More like nine months vacation innocent. What's a girl to do? These revelations from the last chapter of the Bible were given to and recorded by the apostle, John, to warn of the occurrences that could take place in the final days. The so-called "end times." He will come like a thief in the night. No one knows the day and time. Anyone who claims to know the day and time but in here we have a blue print, a map, a key that could unlock and warn us of the coming apocalypse. Sally? You're new to us here. Why don't you pick up where Edger left off? "And in those days shall men seek death "and shall not find it and shall desire to die "and death shall flee from them "and the shapes of the locusts were like "horses prepared for battle "and on their heads crown of gold and their faces like men." "And they had the hair as the hair of woman" "and their teeth were the teeth of lions" "and they had breast plats of iron" "and the sound of their wings were as the sound" "of chariots and horses running to battle." "And they had tails like scorpions" "and they had the power to hurt men over five months." "And the king over them was the angel of the bottomless pit" "whose name in Hebrew tongue is..." "Beezle." It's pronounced "Beelzebub." "Beelzebub." "And in the Greek tongue his name is Abaddon," "Lucifer." Hi, Sally. Zoe. You look great. Oh, thanks. Is everything okay? We wanted to welcome you back. Are you better? What do you mean? You know what I mean, Sally. You've been away. Everyone knows where. I'm not sure what you're talking about actually. Listen, I'm trying to be sincere here, I'm trying to be friendly. Yeah, I'm just saying, Zoe, that everything that everyone's saying isn't true. Okay, I wasn't in a psych ward or rehab or juvie or whatever. It's not true. Okay, we weren't saying that you were. But can I ask, where were you? I'd sort of rather not talk about it. Look, a couple of us are going up to the woods after school. Me, Karen, a few others, Reed. You know, me and Reed are kind of a thing now. No, I didn't know that. Well, I guess there's a lot you don't know about Reed. Some things a pen pal just can't do. Anything else, Zoe? You and I have a lot in common. There's no reason we shouldn't be best friends. Just come, it'll be fun. I don't know. I kinda of have a lot of stuff I need to do at home. So come after. We'll get high, we'll tell some ghost stories, we'll get high. You do get high, don't you? Just think about it, okay? We'd really love to see you there. Yeah, I'll think about it. Well, we'll see you later. The bike stopped initially right at Martha Shaw's grave. There was a chase ending near the north entryway where he was bludgeoned by a blunt, circular object. Probably his own damn baseball. I want that damn baseball, T, you hear me? And there was a single set of bare feet that dragged the body into the mausoleum where the body was desecrated. Fuck. A sick individual, sir. What do you think, like witches or? Some kind of ritual, satanic in nature, I don't know. Just get all that photographed, okay? Yes, sir. Trickers. Our favorite. Want me to keep an eye on her? Yeah. Starting to think that's a really good idea. Why are you even friends with her? She thinks she sees ghosts! She's crazy! Leave her alone, Zoe. And what're you gonna do about it? Get your big brother to beat me up? I don't need my big brother. Oh, so you want some too, Sally? I'm not afraid of you. Well maybe you should be. You're freaking weird. Oh, look, she tripped on a ghost. Ghost in the graveyard, one, two, three. Ghost in the graveyard, can't catch me. Nova Scotia? Sally, you ready? Yeah, just one sec. Ready? Come on. Poor little Tommy. He was my paper boy. I heard the police are investigating her. Really? Why? Think about it. She shows up again and this little kid is killed at Martha's fucking grave. I didn't think of that. Did you see her with Reed? I can't stand that bitch. Aren't we supposed to feel bad for her or something? She thinks who she is, that's for sure. Yeah, that's what I want to know. Who is she and what is her fucking deal? Think about it, she gets back and this kid is murdered. I mean, part of him left on the freaking grave, man. I know you guys are friends but you got to admit this is some pretty freaky shit. No, no, I know Sally. At her core I know she's good. I mean, I know that. Whatever. No freaking way, man. Speaking of which, thought she was coming tonight. Yeah, so did I. You okay? Yeah. You want a beer? So hanging out with Zoe tonight, huh? Didn't she used to make fun of you? Just saying, I don't know why you're hanging out with these girls. Okay, Billy, I just wanna be apart of the group. I just want to fit in with everybody. You know? Not trying to be this freak who keeps seeing a dead girl. Okay. Gets sent away to wanna be protected. Like. Everybody thinks I was in like a psych ward or whatever, so. I mean, it doesn't even matter like. We were all kids, so, it's whatever. I just... I just wanna be normal. But you're not. You're special. Oh my God, Billy, stop! Fuck! Oh my God! Oh my God, did you not see her standing there? What?! No, I didn't see anything. My fucking life flashed before my eyes. I'm sorry, she was standing literally - in the middle of the road. - You almost killed us! God, okay, I'm... Sorry. It's all right. "And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal" "and there was great earthquake and the sun" "became black as sackcloth of hair" "and the moon became as blood" "and the stars of heaven fell onto the earth." "Untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind." "And the heaven departed as a scroll" "when it is rolled together" "and every mountain and island" "were moved out of their places." Ghostly Whisper: Sally. "And the kings of the earth and the great men" "and the rich men and the chief captains" "and the mighty men and every bound man" "and every free man" "hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks" "of the mountains." Sally. "And said to the mountains and rocks," "fall on us and hide us from the face of Him." Sally. Sally? Sally?! Yes? The face of who? I'm sorry, what? Who's face are they hiding from? Satan? Incorrect, Sally. Anyone know who man hides his face from in this passage? Yes, Zoe. Is it God? Yes, Zoe. It is God. Hey. Thanks for picking me up again. Yeah, of course. Do you always visit her? Always. I like that. But there is something I'd like to talk to you about. Is it Zoe? Yeah, how'd you know? Premonition. Let me deal with her. I just, I think it's best if she heard about us from me. We've hung out a bit over the past. Mm-hmm, yeah, okay. She hasn't always been the nicest to me. But I do think everyone deserves a second chance. Even Zoe. You both deserve it. You look... There's something different. Like a good different? Yeah, like a great different. Why, thank you. I guess. Is there anything else? Well, yeah, I mean, you're a great friend. You're nice to everyone and I don't know how you do it. What else? Penmanship. Penmanship? Yeah. You know, all those letters you wrote. All those promises you made. Really great penmanship. Hi. Miss Erlock. Hey, Sally, what brings you here? Well, actually, my dad asked me to do a little research for him. Like family tree stuff, war records, police records. Hopefully not a lot of those. But yeah, just marriage certificates, birth certificates. I'm sorry, honey, but I'm not allowed to give out that information to minors. You're gonna need your father's permission. Oh, really? I mean, I can call him right now. He knows about all this stuff so. Well, I suppose I can do something. You're just gonna need to give me a few days to get everything together. Oh my gosh, thank you so much. You have no idea how much this means to me and my dad. Okay, great, I'll see you in a week? Sure, Sally. Thank you so much. Yes. It's me. Erlock. Charlie, I'm glad they're okay. This whole Tommy Farkus mutilation, the ritualistic element. She's starting to ask questions. I know. I think it's time to consider all the possibilities. Even the worst. You're right. Look, bud, I got to go. Thanks for the coffee. All right. Thanks for stopping by. Yeah. Look, I'm gonna set a patrolman outside. Okay. He's one of us. If you need anything, don't hesitate. Great, thank you. I can always count on you. Zo! Only my friends call me Zo. What's up, Jade? I found what you were looking for. Really? Yep, I know where Sally Sullivan was that whole time and believe me, it's good. Okay. There's something else. Sally and Reed were kind of writing to each other while she was away. You can go now, Jade. Sally. What's up, T? Sally, you're back in town. I am, yeah. Back in good old Mt. Mariah. Heaven on Earth. Back a couple days and already bored of home sweet home, huh? Sounds about right. Well, it's called teen angst, I guess. Sort of a right. I mean, you would know, you graduated like 15 minutes ago, right? Wow. Apple doesn't fall too far from the tree, does it? Yeah, I think she kinda got you there, bud. That wouldn't be the first time either. Well, I think I've worn out my welcome. Charlie, I'll look into that item for you. Sally, welcome back. Thanks. All right, thanks bud. See you later. So what was that all about? Oh, I'm thinking about putting some security in, you know, and he's got this little side business. What're you doing? Just dropping by. Came to say hey real quick. All right. Well, make yourself cozy. Actually, I wanted I ask you. Yeah? Where was I born? What makes you ask that? Well, I always thought I was born here in Mt. Mariah, right? Oh. No, actually you were born in Canada of all places. We were on vacation and you decided to come into this world a littler earlier than expected. You're our little Canadian goose. I thought your mother would've told you that. No, I don't think she did. I don't really remember Mom, so... Do you think she's still alive? Yeah, I know she's still alive. I feel it in here. Excuse me, do you have any rat poison? Yeah, just this way, follow me here. Sally? Yeah, Dad, actually I got to run real quick but I'll see you later. Oh, okay. All right, I'll see you around dinner. What do we got there? That's a nice shovel, good choice, I like that. That's a prime digger. Hi, Sally. Hi. Can we talk? About Martha. Dad, I'll be back. What do you mean you've seen her too? Sally, everyone knows you've seen her, don't you? Zoe. I mean, the difference this time is I believe you. I've seen her too. The truth is, I've seen her before. At first I tried to deny her existence. I would shut my eyes and wish her away. I was afraid they would send me away like they did to you or I would be labeled crazy like you were. But now something has changed in her. She's become more menacing. She wants something from me I think. Something from us. - She said... - Wait. She spoke to you? She said, "Beelzebub is here." Oh my God. I've heard that name in my dreams. Sally, that wasn't a dream. That's how the dead speak to us. She wants something from me, I think. Or something from us. Sheriff's office. Hey, Charlie. Oh, she does? Yeah, the black circle's been called. Okay. Of course, Charlie. Very good. All right, goodbye. What's up, everything okay? I think it's time. Sally? Hi, is Zoe home? Why not come in and we'll see? I could just call her real quick on my cell, it's okay. Sally, please come in and I'll make you some tea. Okay. Don't move, I'll be right with you. Did Zoe know you were coming? I thought so. She did? And she didn't tell me. What is that you're readying, Sally Ann? You feel drawn to it, no? It calls to you, yes? I was just looking at it. We are so misunderstood, Sally Ann. Sally Ann? Isn't that what they call you? Are you gonna get the kettle? You have such beautiful hair, Sally Ann, like your mother did. May I touch it? Mother? Sally? What's going on? We were just getting to know one another. Why? Do not mettle with things you don't understand. What's going on? You should go. Zoe! Hey, you coming in? I can't, I got to run. But come here a second. Okay. Hey! Missed you. Okay. See you. Lily? Lily? Lily? Oh my God, Zoe, you scared the shit out of me. What're you doing here? I'm sorry, it's just that the door was open and she was crying, so... Did you not see me on the street? I didn't. What were you doing in the street? You're right, though, I shouldn't have. - No, it's... - Here. It's fine. She seems to like you. Yeah, she does, doesn't she? Martha was like the closest thing I ever had to a sibling. Are you close? You and Billy? Yeah, we're close. My whole family is. With everything that we've been through, I'm sure, I wouldn't have gotten through it all without them. You're so lucky. Martha's family was basically raising me until she died. My mom is, well, she's always been a little less than ideal. I know people talk about her. Talk about us and it's mostly true. And I hate her for it. But don't think I don't know what people are saying. What about your dad? Just like your mom. Gone. You know, Zoe, I think that together, somehow, you and I can really help Martha. Thank you, Sally. I should probably put this little one to bed now. She's so perfect. Say goodnight, Lily. Come with me. Goodnight, angel. Okay, Lily, time for your nap. Goodnight. There we go. I love you. So. So... You've been hanging out with Reed. Have you guys done it? Zoe, what? Have you done it? Look, you're in on this plan to free Martha, right? I've actually been doing some research of my own. Okay, remember that name I kept hearing in my dreams a bunch? "Beelzebub." Isn't that such a creepy word? "Beelzebub?" You shouldn't say it so much. It gives it power. Okay. So, this name that shall not be said, is one of the six fallen angels sent to Earth to disrupt His, God's, balance to turn the world against his 11 tribes to end his earthly family. Are you okay? That's good, Sally, that's really good. What does Beelzebub want? What I think that it wants is you, Sally. Me? I think there's something really special about you and somehow this demon is working its way through Martha to get to you. Through Martha? This is like insane! I'm not special, Zoe. I'm no one. To free a pure spirit like Martha a pure spirit must be sacrificed. A blood sacrifice. A sacrifice like what? A sinless creature. Like a rabbit? I don't think that'll do it. Think bigger. A six foot tall rabbit? What are you, Sally-fucking-Darko? Okay, I don't know, what're you talking about? Think fucking bigger. Well, if you and Reed haven't done it yet... So you didn't fuck him. You are a virgin. Are you saying you want to sacrifice me? Yeah, but not like kill you or anything. We just need a spill, well, we need to spill your virgin blood on her grave, say some chants and then she's free, I think, and you will be too. It seems simple enough. Zoe, are you... I'm sorry, are you insane? Spill my blood? Not a lot. It's you it's after. Not me, not Martha, not Tommy Farkus. Whatever you are, it wants you. Zoe. You don't have to tell me your secrets but you will help Martha! Ow! Ow, Zoe, you're hurting me! - Hey. - Ow. Sally? I just feel the myth rumbling, like there's this disjointed energy. Charlie, look, I think it's time we tell her. She needs to know, and Billy. That's the end of everything I know, Dale. I mean, my family... ends just like that? Look, we knew this day was coming. Okay? You've done your job, you've done a fine job, Charlie. She's my daughter. I know and everybody's proud. No one could have nurtured her better than you have. Okay? It's time. Yeah. Thanks. And we've got another round. - Cheers, man. - Thank you. Let me know if I can get you guys anything else, yeah. Dad, what is it? There's more to Sally than meets the eye. Dad, what're you saying? She's, she's, she's not entirely your sister. Excuse me, what?! I've been fearing this day for years but it's here and the time has come for me to tell you about your family. To tell you who you are, where you're from. Who I am, who Sally is. Dad, you're freaking me out, okay? You're Charlie Sullivan. - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yes. - Yeah? You work at the hardware store. Yeah. What do you mean, "who we really are?" Since the beginning of time, there's been a battle being waged on this earth between good and evil. Well, your family is smack dab in the middle of it. I don't fucking believe this. Sally? Yeah. And Mom? Yes. So you've been lying to me this whole time. Are you even my dad? Is this even a real family? Yes! And Sally's my daughter and the time has come for you to help protect her. The time has come to put on the armor, son, because we're going into battle. Let's do it. The shit's about to hit the fan. I need you, son. You got me? I got you. This is gonna be a long one. All right. What do we got here? "Hellraiser," that's easy. Got that. "Boomstick." Lily, you're supposed to be sleeping. Let's go to bed, okay? Goodnight. Trickers? Oh my God! Oh my God, no! Oh my God, oh my God! Oh my God! Oh no, oh my God! Martha! Look, look, slow down, hold on. Okay, look, Onus is dead and Sally was seen fleeing the scene into the woods. Well did you check the house? What about Lily? No. What the fuck? Dad, help me with this! Oh, sweetheart. Oh, come here, sweetie. Yeah, she's okay. She's okay, she's okay. You take her. Charlie! Charlie! Charlie! You said it yourself, desperate times. Nobody gets my baby. Let's do this. Charlie! She's coming for you. Zoe, hey. Can I come in? Um... I mean, I got soked, so... Yeah. You wanna get high? For old times' sake. Seems like you and Sally have been spending a lot of time together. Looks like her and I have a lot more in common than I even imagined. She sees ghosts. So do I. It's okay. You don't have to say anything. Do you know what it means when I do that? I think so. It means that I want you to... I'm so glad you found her. It's no problem at all, Charlie. I can't thank you enough. It's my job, just doing my job. My daughter means everything to me. Okay, thanks. So thanks for keeping a lookout. I'm gonna let you go in. I appreciate it, yeah. All right. Dad? Hey, sweetie. Dad, what's going on? Sweetie. Dad, I need to know... There's something that you need to tell me. Something else that you've been keeping from me. Oh God, this is harder than I expected. Dad, I found my birth certificate. Oh, sweetie. Am I adopted? Why do I not have a last name on my birth certificate? It's complicated. What happened to Mom? They got her. Who? Sally, you know that I love you more than anything in the world. I held you the day that you were born and I have loved you ever since more than any father could. But yeah, yeah, you're right. You were given to us, to raise and to protect and to love. Who am I, Dad? You're Sally Sullivan, the daughter of Charlie Sullivan but you were born for something much bigger. Sweetie, you come from a long, long sacred bloodline. You're one the descendants of Mary. Yeah, that Mary. Sweetie, that's why we've had to hide you and that's why they're after you. Who is? The bad guys. But all of them have one thing in common, and that is they have the hand of Satan on their shoulder and his words turn in their ears. Does Billy know about this? Only just now. You have to know... That all the good that has ever been done on this earth rests upon the safety of your family and they're after us. And the closer they get to us, the closer we get to the end of days. Like in Revelations? Yeah. "And in those days shall men seek death and not find it" "and desire to die." "And death will flee from them." The night that Martha died, that was supposed to be you but they didn't wanna just kill you, they wanted to sacrifice you. And baby, if that had happened, I don't know what I'd do. It'd be the end of the world. Sweetie, you're my daughter and you will always be my little girl. Now I have something for you. This actually came with you. This is yours. This was blessed by Mary in France after she fled Jerusalem from the very hands that are chasing after you. This is your family heritage. What're you gonna do? I'm gonna go kill some witches. Sweetheart, whatever you do, do not leave this hospital. You understand that? I do, yeah. - You promise? - I promise. Okay. Okay, I love you. I love you. Are you okay? - Sally! - No! Sally, you need to come with me! No! No! Sally! You're not gonna believe this. Now what? Sally Sullivan just escaped from the emergency center. Yeah, no shit, Sherlock. Plan on doing some work today? Shit's about to go down and I think I know where. Get your weapon. Reed! Reed! Reed, oh God. Oh God, help us. Reed, Reed. Reed, buddy. Dear God, no, no. Reed, Reed. I'm gonna get you out of here. Come on. What is that? What is this? You believe in the devil? What? Look, I don't know if you're a religious man or not but if I were you, I'd let the good sister, here, bless you before you go in there. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Bless you, my son. In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, Amen. Joe, you head for the mausoleum, I'm gonna head down for the crosses. And radio me if you need help. You got it? All right. God is with you. God is with you both. Is anybody there?! Hello? Hello, is anybody in there? Kill her. Game's over, bitch! Oh my God, Zoe?! Shit. Oh no, oh my God, I killed her. Oh my God. Dad, no! Sally. Oh my God! And you shall know me, for I shall cast out demons in His name. And I shall speak in tongues of angels. Sally! I rebuke and bind thee, Satan. Just die, Sally. Zoe! Sally, get away, that's not Zoe. And you shall know me, Satan, the Lord, thy God, and you shall reside at the foot of the cross for all days until you are summoned and you shall be cast into the bottomless pit. Amen. This belongs to you now, Sally. All right, take it. Everything's gonna be all right, okay? I promise. Everything's gonna be all right. You did good, kiddo. Thank you, Dad. You did so good. Oh, I'm so proud of you. I love you. I love you. Keep this always. This is yours now. - I'll be right back. - I'll see you later. Reed. Wait! Reed. Thank you for always believing in me. Hey. You okay? You wanna go home? Told ya you were special. Take us home. Zoe liked to say the dead talked to us in our sleep. I hope she was right because Martha often came to me, talked with me, but from then on, only in the night when I was dreaming. Never would I see her face again running amongst the heather and vine of Mt. Mariah Cemetery. Others claim to see her and the truth and the fiction of what began here in our little town became blurred with the passing years. Most made her out as some demon. And that was sad. But I knew she was an angel sent by God to protect me. At the time, I thought this was an end for me and the events surrounding her death. But the reality was this was just my initiation into a lifetime battle the forces of evil as I sought to discover God's plan for me and my place in His kingdom. The reality was... it was just the beginning.
