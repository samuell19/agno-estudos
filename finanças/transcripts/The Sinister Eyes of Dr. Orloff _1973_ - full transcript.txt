How did you know I was awake? I heard you scream. It's always the same story. A scream, a jump, you wake up, Then you calm down once you realize the wolf is not going to eat you. and then you end up missing breakfast. I can't do anything to avoid that nightmare, I'm sorry. The doctor comes today, Uncle Henry called him. He will give you a small treatment to calm your nerves and within a couple of days your nightmares will disappear. What doctor is going to come? He seems to be a good doctor. Not too long ago, he established himself in the region. His name is Dr. Orloff. Dr. Orloff is a psychiatrist. I don't know, I guess. Martha, do you think I'm going crazy? Don't talk nonsense What I think, what Uncle Henry and Flora, and even Matthews, the butler, think, It is that you are only 20 years old and you have spent half of your lifetime stuck in that bed without seeing anyone but your family. And you can't do that Melissa. You can't always remain in this state of lethargy. Without knowing one guy you like, without any fun at all. Without having a boyfriend, to flirt or something. Your nerves will suffer, that's all. It is true, but what can I do? For now, drink that coffee. Before it gets cold. Were you listening, Matthews? I'm sick of you spying. One of these days I'll have my uncle put you on the street. No, ma'am, you will not do that. Are you sure? Yes, Miss. Martha. Otherwise, I will be forced to tell Sir. Henry some things about you. Your nightime escapades and your ties with Lady Comfort. to deceive and steal from my Lord. Get out of my sight. I have something more to say, I will continue spying, as you say I do especially to ensure the safety of Miss. Melissa. What do you mean? It is clear, Miss. Martha. If someone tries to harm her, Poor Mathews, you have forgotten your position. and self control as a butler and kill the person that harms her. You have you fallen in love with my sister? First, I know very well that you are alone the sister of Miss. Melissa, whose mother died at her birth. You are the daughter of a former showgirl and the late Lord Comfort. A passing fling of my Lord, fortunately. Secondly, if I am looking out for the safety of Miss. Melissa, It is because her father was a gentleman and an example. What's wrong? Nothing serious, that stupid Matthews who makes things up everyday.. It's not worth you getting upset over that. How's your sister Melissa? I have already called the doctor's office, And what was her reaction? She's afraid she's going crazy. Well, she would be doing us a favor. Are you feeling better? The doctor will be here in few minutes. He's a good doctor and an old friend. He's an international specialist in nervous diseases. Matthews has brought your chair. I want you to take a walk in the garden and get out of this room. You can both talk out there in private Is the weather nice Mathews? A wonderful day, Miss. Melissa. Would you bring me a dress please? As you say. If I could, I would take care of the garden I would too Miss Melissa But my double duties as a butler and driver does not leave me much free time. Matthews, isn't it right, if father had lived he would have been a good gardener? Of course, Miss, a great gardener. In addition, your father helped him many afternoons. Matthews, nobody has told me how my father died? He died suddenly Miss. Melissa. That's what they have always told me, but no one has explained to me how. If no one has done, it's not for me to betray the secret. Why is it a secret? What happened to my father? - Tell me! Melissa. Melissa, I would like to introduce Dr. Orloff to you. Good morning, it is a pleasure to meet you, Miss. Let's leave Matthews. Dr. Orloff should speak privately. with our dear Melissa. Your family has told me that you're crazy. Is that true? My family has told you? That I am crazy Forgive my brusque manner of speaking, but I was interested to see your first reaction. I never realized they thought I was crazy. According to your relatives, you suffer persecution mania, hysterical crises and frustration, imaginary illnesses. You have terrifying visions that makes you scream in the middle of the night. obsessive dreams and a few other things. Do not cry anymore, please. Come on, calm down. Tell me about your nightmares. Yes doctor. I'm home alone, I am ten years old. That is, the age when my father died. I hear terrible cries. and then I look out, I tell myself I will go down the stairs, when I hear footsteps approaching, and I see a man. Your father? Sometimes I think it's him, but I'm not too sure. That man is dying, His blood falls on my legs. I'm terrified, but I can't move. I'm paralyzed. I'm very glad I came to see you. You are very lovely, miss, and it would be a shame to lock you up. I knew your father very well. He was a perfect gentleman. More charming than your uncle Henry, although he's a charming man. Do you know how he died? Nobody wanted to tell me. Do you know? I certified his death. We were in love with the same woman, your mother. She was called. Melissa. He married her. They were in love. I later married and had a daughter. Also named Melissa. I never stopped loving your mother. When your father died, I left very far from here.. I returned just a month ago. And your daughter? Died. It was an accident. You look a lot like her. That's why I will not hide anything from you. I'll help you. I'll do everything I can to help you. Your family has played a stupid game hiding everthing from you. I'm sorry to tell you, Melissa, but your father was murdered.. 10 years ago someone cut his throat as he slept. It can not be, you're lying to me. You want to get another reaction out of me. I wish that was true, But I assure you t that what I'm telling you is the truth. who murdered him? The murderer was never found.. Impossible, it was an impossible crime. He was home alone with you. Doors and windows were tightly closed, no one could enter. And it would have been absurd to think that it was you who did it. You were born paralyzed, Melissa, your paralysis is congenital. But, "But I... know I have walked before. I know, I remember. In that little head of yours, dreams and reality blend. I hope to put everything in place, do not panic, relax. At the moment I will prescribe a new medication, and I will return in a few days. Well, at least I've given you something to think about. Good morning. Melissa, what are you doing here at this hour? Melissa, you can walk. Yes, I can walk. You have always deceived me. You always made me believe I was paralysed and it is not true. But what are you saying? I have nothing against you. You're the daughter of my brother. I love you like a daughter. Melissa, what's wrong? Why you looking at me like that? What's that you have there? Melissa, is that the clock's pendulum you are holding? What are you doing with that? Why are you holding it? It must be very late. What time is it Matthews? It's almost seven o'clock, Miss. It was a wonderful party. The Duke of Windsor has always had exquisite taste with receptions. but this time they have exceeded. Again that stupid girl. I'll take breakfast to her. Leave her. Matthews will take it. No, I want to see how she is. Hello Beautiful. As an alarm clock no one equals you. Martha, its terrible. I had another terrible bloody dream. Do not bother telling me, I know your nightmares by memory This time was different, and more horrible than ever. It seems that the new medication suits you. Besides, I'm sleepy We returned about seven o'clock. Is it true that last night you were at a party? It was hilarious. I had at least ten admires. The poorest, more than a million pounds in weight. And the younger, more than a million years old. And don't think, Aunt Flora didn't flirt also. And Uncle Henry? Uncle Henry did not come to the party. He doesn't like that kind of reception. He was at home, didn't you see him? I don't know I think I may have but I'm not sure. But perhaps it was in my dreams. Where is Uncle Henry? He left before we got home. He was going hunting with a group of friends. Are you sure Uncle Henry went hunting? Sure, why not? I don't know, but for a moment I had the feeling, that Uncle Henry had died. Tell me, Matthews, Do you see Sir Henry when you came back with the ladies? No, Miss. Sir Henry went hunting around five in the morning. How are you so sure if you did not see him? First, because he told me. Second, because when I went to park the car, I didn't see his sports car. It is the car that he always uses when he goes hunting. But why this insistence, Miss. Melissa? I have this strange premonition. As if Sir Henry had died. Does this mean that something may have happened? I don't know, but I'd like you to do me a favor. I am at your service, Miss. Melissa. When Sir Henry goes hunting he takes his weapons, I suppose. That's right, he is a maniac for weapons. Miss knows very well, he has more than ten shotguns. He uses each one depending on what he will hunt. Please, will you check to see which weapons are missing? and accessories, as if he had really gone hunting? Yes, Miss immediately. You won't move from here, right? Of course not. Davey, honey, come to the pool? Later, o.k. Come on, Davey, what are you waiting for? Hey, come on. Guys, look at the fruit growing on the trees over here.. Who is that? Hey, girl! Come take a swim with us! If you don't come, we will go to hunt you Come on, we're not going to eat you. But hey, why are you hiding? I bet you don't know my name.? My name is Robert Prokop Davey Eugene Hutchinson. But my friends call me Davey so we can talk about other things. Well, now you're coming. Jump the hedge and come with us,. Should I help you? Oh, forgive me, I did not know you were using that. After all, it is not so bad. I ride my bike a lot, it's almost the same.. I like you very much you know? You're very pretty I can teach you to swim. Would you like that? Go away. Davey, Davey! Forgive me? - Go away! Davey! Get out of here Haven't you heard the lady? Get out! And if you interfere again, in this private property, I swear you'll never forget! Sorry, excuse me, excuse me. I'm the next door neighbor, I just wanted to invite Miss. I checked on the weapons. There's just one shotgun missing. and it's not Sir Henry who took it. What do you mean? How do you know? The Western is a big game shotgun. It could kill a bear with a single shot. Lord Comfort would not have taken that. to hunt wild ducks. That means... Someone who does not understand hunting, Has taken the shotgun and a few cartridges, to make us believe that Sir Henry is hunting. But that's horrible. You have to call the police. If Sir Henry has not returned at midnight, I myself will call Inspector Crosby. Did you say something to my aunt or my sister? They left a while ago, they said they were going to the city. It's horrible, Matthews. What can we do? I think all we can do is go in and wait.. A bad cough you have, So you're Paul, Paul Nothing. Since I was baptized, Commissioner. No, just call me Inspector nothing else. Look, I do not understand much about titles but I have a rule: When in doubt it's better to aim higher than lower Well, well, what about this Paul Nothing, what does it mean? Just that, nothing. I don't have a surname because I have no name. I'm what they call abandoned. Orphan? It is that, I always forget that word.. So you've found the body. Yes, I found it, Commissioner. I saw the abandoned car off the road, and I went out of curiosity. And suddenly, I discovered the body, it was full of blood. At first I thought it was a woman because of the shirt. Yes, the man wore a silk shirt and high-heeled shoes. He had his throat cut on his neck across his jugular. That's it, right? Eh, I do not know. I think I know that guy, he is a Lord or something. Hey look, he was out there dressed as a woman. Those people are all the same, so then... Uh, yeah, that's enough. You can leave, but do not leave the city. Do you know my address here in town? You can give them to my assistant who is also a commissioner. Ah, public park, third bank. from the statue of Wellington. I don't think that will help us too much, I agree with you. Yes? I'm Nicolas, what is it? I'll tell the inspector, thank you. It all fits, according to Scotland Yard. Sir Henry Robert Comfort, Duke of Delmon, Lord of the Royal Crown, it was an inverted like the top of a pine. He was condemned for being a pedophile. May he rest in peace. Yes. It is curious how he looked so normal. This is complicated. Now we must assume that this is a crime of passion. Anyway we will check what the family was doing. Inspector, Crosby. Ah! Yes, yes, yes, Matthews, yes. Thanks but we have already found him. You have found him? Where? I will. Good night. The Lord has been murdered. He was in the car with a knife in his neck. Miss: Miss. Melissa, Miss! Miss. Melissa. Melissa. Inspector Crosby. I'm Mrs. Vinegard. My husband has gone. You have to find him and bring him home, do you hear me? Please, ma'am, give me the personal details about your husband? A meter 85, thin, dark, blue eyes, 32 years. Tell me, how old are you, ma'am? That's rude, why do you ask. Excuse me. Has it been a while since you last saw him? Yes, he didn't come last night to sleep. Which is strange because I don't allow him to get home late. Look, lady. What surprises me is that he left. Good evening 'Or is it morning now? Good evening, doctor. Yes, yes, okay. Yes, ma'am, I will look for him. Goodbye. I beg your pardon, doctor. I did not mean to bother you, but Dr. Warren County Coroner, Is on vacation in Spain, And the autopsy for Lord Comfort is very urgent. You do not have to apologize, I am at your service. Besides, it's some years, Since I performed an autopsy. It has been a pleasure. Here is the report. Except for one detail, which is standard. Sir Henry has been dead more than 24 hours. How? Was he not killed tonight? Or at least this afternoon? No, no sir. And today we can be precise about these things. with a minimum margin of error. No doubt that Sir Henry died between ten and eleven o'clock last night. Well, if you need something else, do not hesitate to contact me. I'm entirely at your disposition. Thank you Doctor. It is your own blood, which was my curse. Only your blood... Erase the shame Henry, rest in peace. I crudely usurped the woman I wanted to give to your brother. That disgusting reptile that called himself my friend. But he already paid with his life a long time ago. in the same way you will do now. And I still need to take care of the others. That group of monsters and degenerate accomplices, your descendants. I will fulfill the oath, the wrathful sword of justice will fall upon all of us.. Do you think that one day You will ever forget that woman? Dear Inge, the day my revenge is fulfilled, I will be at peace and I will begin my life again. Meanwhile, I have no feelings other than hatred. And I can not hold... .Another desire, than the day of death. No one could guess the capacity of violence in such a weak person. We all carry a germ of dementia in the brain. When something more powerful than reason itself releases the crazed monster, it is almost impossible to stop. I have seen three burly men fight for many minutes to prevent a young boy from committing a crazy murder Isn't it dangerous that having overcome her disability Melissa is free here? She could not attack us during the night? She hates us, doctor, she envies us. Melissa will only be infuenced by me She will only kill when I command her.. Anyway, if you feel easier locking her in her room, then do so Although it will not help because she will only act as I wish her to do. You do no more than what I command you, poor creature. Oh! Why are you injecting me? This injection will make you relax for a few hours. Now you're mine. You are a true reflection of my will. Wonderful hours of blood and death await. But first, you have to try to rest. Rest. Rest. Now you belong to me. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Doctor, can we move Melissa? She will sleep five or six hours. Take her before she wakes up. Where do you plan on locking her up? In the basement, next to the stairs. If she screams, no one can hear her from outside. I understand. You will soon have news. When? As soon as possible. And I advise you not to leave here tonight. We will do whatever you say, doctor. Hey, Davey, let's go. I have things to do Leave them! I can't! Besides, I don't feel like it. Felix Flanagan came to the park just to see you! Well, you look after everything, I am not going. Come on come on! Let's go. Come on guys! Bye. Let's take her now, the new neighbors just left. I want all of this to be over.. We'll go very far with the large fortune that we will inherit. The most luxurious hotels around the world, the most beautiful places to visit. I plan on having a thousand adventures with the most handsome men in the world. That is if I don't take them first. Miss. Miss, I have come to rescue you. They just want to hurt you. Use you to do horrible things. My car's out there. We must escape before it is too late. Miss. Melissa! But what are you doing? Yes it's correct. I understand. Thank you. Poor girl, what a pity. It was the doctor who treated her, Dr. Orloff.. He says she's an incurable schizophrenic. It is hopeless, poor thing. And it is dangerous. So they lock her in a room. It seems they brought her here without her knowledge. Poor girl. I know, Davey, it's terrible. You do not know how sorry I am. But we can't do anything. Tomorrow begins our tour. We will go to the mainland You'll see, Brown will give me permission, occasionally, to make you forget that girl. Well, okay, but let's get out of here as soon as possible. Our neighbors, are definitely leaving. Let's call Dr. Orloff. You can come and get her. - Yes. - Thank you. It was Fiske Manor. Now you can go pick up the child. They believe that the matter is over. You bring Melissa here & diagnose her with schizophrenia. They inherit a huge fortune, and you will have avenged all those who tried to harm you.. I'll finish with all degenerates. Now begins the bloody feast. - Good Morning. Come in, doctor. Here, doctor. They have found Matthews? I'll do an autopsy. I will report it was an accident.. You will have to testify, because that's the usual procedure. And wont' they question the coincidence of two deaths so close together? It should not matter if they find it strange. Life is full of things that are stranger than that. She is still sleeping? I have come to take her. Thus concludes our pact that's all. Within a few days she will be diagnosed as crazy & incurable, and you will be named as heirs to the fortune of Lord Comfort. Will we have to wait long? I don't want to be in this house any longer. We'll wait as long as is necessary. Hey, excuse me, I'll look for Melissa. Doctor, I feel bad. It's terrible, I think I'm going to die. I want you to come with me and stay for a while in my clinic. Your condition is critical and I want to give you intense treatment Do what you want, doctor. I no longer... I can not anymore. Not really... No You drink too much, dear, and you've barely touched your food.. I drink to forget. I do not like being here. even tonight Does it bother you to spend more hours in my company? It's not that. I'm nervous, very nervous. I won't be calm Until I check in a good modern hotel, in London. I will live near Hyde Park in the Western. You really do not want to come with me? I would, you know very well. But it's better I stay here until Dr. Orloff Diagnoses the mental incapacity of Melissa Then I can collect the inheritance and close the tax survey. Besides, I like this house. I definitely like it. Until now I've been borrowing the place like a poor intruder that the family accepts because Sir Henry in a drunken state married me But nobody forgets that the new Lady Comfort is a cabaret dancer. A woman with a murky past Melissa is locked up and lost forever. I think when we divide the inheritance I will keep the house. I'll have 5 or 6 servants and I will live here like an established lady of the house You sound like they do in television sitcoms In the end, do what you want. I'll finish my packing and then sleep. tomorrow we have to get up early. I hope you have not changed your mind and you will take me to the station? I never change my mind when I decide something. What do you want, why close the door? Did you really think I would split everything with you? With you. You made a mistake by telling Dr. Orloff and even the police about your departure. Nobody will be surprised not to see you here. What are you doing Flora Nothing... Good evening. I came because I saw the lights on and I dared to call. What do you want? I was in the bathroom. You do not know how sorry I am. I'm the next door neighbor. Well, rather, the ex neighbor. You see, I came to pick up some things and the people said You had new misfortunes. They also told me that... The young lady was taken to a madhouse. A madhouse! People talk and don't know what they say. Melissa is in a private clinic under observation. Why are you so interested? You are the aunt, right? Aunt-in-law. May I pass? It will be just a moment, I'd like to talk to you. Sorry, I'm alone and it is too late. Come back another day and we can talk. Listen! Please, the clinic where Melissa is, is that Dr. Orloff's clinic? Sorry, good night. Good morning, Inspector Crosby. Good morning, Michael. Your Hindu tea? Yes, as always. Anything else? No thanks. I must leave immediately. Good morning sir. Please, you're the inspector Crosby, right? Yes, indeed I am the inspector Crosby. And who are you? Donovan, Gilbert, Sulliver or any of those musicians Who go around playing the guitar? Please, I'm Davey, of Davey, Sweet and Brown Ah, Davey Sweet and Brown. I remember watching the television show. Did you like it? Honestly speaking, I prefer Lawrence Welk. I'm not surprised, that's understandable. I wanted to talk to you about a place called Fiske Manor Fiske Manor? How do you know that place? You see my colleagues and I rented a house to rehearse and prepare our new album. The house is next to Fiske Manor. There is a strange, sinister atmosphere. I do not know what to think. screams, cries and groans are heard. People die there and it is unclear why. How can you explain that now also they have found the butler murdered, and they have taken the girl for no apparent reason? We need to do something. I think they are there in the house, perhaps dead. Yes, dead. Yes Yes Yes. It's a pretty ugly affair. Last night I went to see them and I spoke to the sinister woman. She must be doing something wrong, because her hair was wet and her robe was also wet.. Don't you think it's strange? Yes, yes, very strange. Did it not occur to you that she was washing her hair? Oh. Look, inspector, this is not my business, of course. If I speak, it is because I fear that girl is in danger. All this is suspect. I assure you, inspector. It's late, I must leave now. You do not believe me, right? You boys are drug users correct? You tend to be fond of drugs. I assume it is marijuana? I assure you I'm in my right mind. This cigarette is nothing special. The problem is you don't believe me With your permission, good morning. Hey, hey, wait! Listen to me, please. Only I ask you to make an inquiry on your own about Fiske Manor. Look, young man. I can not start a survey against someone for the simple fact that she has wet hair and gown, because at their house screams, groans and wails are heard, and because you find this situation sinister. and nobody but you, finds it sinister. Yes, if you put it that way, you are quite right, Inspector. You have too much imagination. Believe me, you had to be there to see it. I am an artist, and I have a special sensitivity. I am sure that something terrible is happening in that house. I understand, young man. But, look, although I'm no artist, I know exactly what you mean. So what then? These past few days many things have happened to the people in that house. You also realize Of course, Lord Comfort killed his butler, but we can understand, he was apparently found dead in an accident. The girl is locked in a clinic because she is crazy. I do not know, but I also find this very strange also. Just as you already see But the fact is we have checked alibis of Lady Comfort and young Martha. They are perfect alibis. There is nothing we can do we can not confront them. And now they will inherit a huge fortune. Wait, there's more. What about that Dr. Orloff? Yes, Dr. Orloff. I understand that the girl is confined to his clinic. Yes, he is a great friend of the two women. I saw him there several times from my window. talk to them in secret before visiting Melissa. Well, if they are his good friends That's nothing unusual to talk to them about his patient It was the way he did it very sinister. Look here Leave me alone, you understand All this sinister talk, an atmosphere. I don't know what secret... wet hair. How do you expected me to act against anyone without any evidence, nor any proof? I hope I am wrong inspector! I am warning you, if you come back to speak about evil atmospheres again.. I will incarcerate you. These police inspectors understand nothing of crimes. This is Nicolas It's Mrs. Vinegard, about the missing husband.. Hey, wait a minute, I want you to spy all around Fiske Manor. What's the matter? I don't know, Nicolas, but there is something very strange It's this crazy story, about dead people and all that. And who do I watch? Everything, the atmosphere is very strange there, Strange things happen. Be aware. And if you see anything unusual, let me know right away. Tell Robert to keep an eye on Dr. Orloff's clinic. The atmosphere too? Yes, and tell Mrs. Vinegard to come in.. May I come in inspector Crosby? Are you Mrs. Vinegard? Yes, it's me. Have you heard anything about my husband? Well, yes, now I know something. If he doesn't return then he's a complete fool. Melissa. A beautiful name. You could have been my daughter. You should have been my daughter, but you were born in the Comfort home That's why I hate you. For this you are the center of my revenge. You have been my instrument. I know in your brain, dreams and reality blend in a strange way. But I will help you remember. You were born paralyzed because I traumatized your mother. With my magnetic force I manipulated her to wish you were deformed This desire influenced the formation of your body. It was as if I had participated in your procreation. And so it would have been if your mother had not rejected my love. Years later, I decided to kill your father. Do you remember your nightmare? It was a crime without explanation, doors and windows were all closed, and he was killed when he was only alone with his ten year old daughter. But in your nightmare an essential detail was left out. Because your subconscious rejects it. You killed your father. That night I made you move your legs for the first time, I made you grasp the clock's pendulum. You killed him in the same way as Uncle Henry. But in reality it wasn't you., But you acted under my will. But it was your hand, your infantile hand, that did it. Blood splattered on your legs. Until that night, your physical disability wasn't diagnosed as incurable. Since then, you will never be the same. Your mind is destroyed. Under my orders, under the invincible power of my magnetism, You can and do walk, but always at the command of my desire. You have committed two more ferocious crimes. Your recent nightmares were not nightmares. Believe it or not, You really committed those horrible crimes. You've lost your mind, Melissa. As I told you you are the instrument of my will. Morphine. No, no, no! Anyone there? Anyone there? Who's there? Inspector Crosby! Guess what's happened? What happen? Another sinister atmosphere? Please come with me, we should go. Calm down, calm down, you are very nervous, young man. You have to believe me, you must trust me. Look, young man, I'm not going to look for strange atmospheres. It's not about that. I've seen a dead woman being dragged across the grass. With a towel on her head. Lady Comfort was dragging her. Well, that sounds better. And now we have a reason to go pay them a visit. Do you have a car? Yes, but it's not at the house now.. You are not the one to tell me what to do. I know exactly where we need to go. to find what we are looking for. 'Well, I will come. Get down, they will see you.. Be quiet! No! Be quite! Will it take a while? She will be ready soon.. How about through there? You can't. Here you go! Thank you. Dear Melissa, wretched creature, this injection will be a farewell for all of us.. "No, no. Its effect will be fast, very fast and deadly. "Oh, no! You will lose your mind completely, lost forever.. - Forever. -No no no. And I will be named executor of your estate. Watch out. Come! Oh no! No no!
