A SELIN / MÃ„KELÃ„ FILM There's a gap between us Heaven, hell and earth Walls breaking around us Long days, what they're worth Eleven years and counting cursing and shouting This is not singing. Come one. Let the dude play. The world is changing. And music. a It wasn't easy for me either to start with. I wanted to sing Elvis. And Tom Jones. You know, I became 65 a while back. Congratulations. - You mean condolences. This is retirement age. My singing days are done. You must be joking. Humor, humor. My voice sounds better than ever. I have my own orchestra. My boys are playing in it. I could never stop singing. Except at home. If I start singing, Piitu tells me to shut up. She doesn't mean any harm. She's always believed in me. Even when I haven't. Strange. KING OF HEARTS Let the songs take the part Like the birds in the sky But alone in my lonely heart She's the only one, my my Oh if I only could Get to the wonderland You know then we would Always be hand-in-hand Still I'm chained to the ground But my thoughts will fly In my heart I'm homeward bound Across the endless sky How old are you? - Nineteen, sir. Don't you call me sir, damn it. I'm Tapsa. Always have been. From the Worker's Sports Federation. The first Olympic Champion of WSF. Local sports club. Inner lane. I'm Kari Jalkanen. I bet you'd like a sip. - No, thank you, sir. No? Well, just one, to get the taste. You're developing a great voice. Now you need some decent music. No trashy pop songs. Real songs have a story. A beginning and an end. Country. - That's my music, too. Mr. Rautavaara. - What did I just tell you? The band said this is the last song without the singer. -I see. An another thing. The consumption of alcoholic beverages is forbidden here. This is not a consumption. More like a duty. The stories in the songs? What should they be like? You'll figure it out. Tapio Rautavaara. The winner of the song contest and three single records - is Kari Tapani Jalkanen. The prize will be presented by the maestro himself. The kid did well. So well that I was wondering in the backroom - how can I be in two places simultaneously? Err. Pretty cold, ain't it? Or something. Not terribly warm. Tapsa, he's the boss, right? The boss? What sort of hillbilly talk is that? I'd rather be watching Elvis. This guy sings his songs. They even call him the local Elvis. I love to sing rock. And one day, I'll write my own songs. With a message. With a real story. Wham, bam and Amen! I see. You girls want to have a smoke around the corner? - I don't smoke. I wouldn't give you one anyway. But you can watch me smoking. I'll join you. Is she from Helsinki? The way she speaks. -From HyvinkÃ¤Ã¤. Her father is the new headmaster of trade school. Headmaster's daughter? Really? Did you come here by bike? We hitchhiked. - All right, okay. Let's do it like this. Here's a couple of singles for you. But you must fix the princess for me. Just her, when the dancing's done. Right. Stop. Stop. Shall we start from scratch? It's not terribly warm. Pretty cold, ain't it? This is the place where you call me a hillbilly. Drive, drive. Not much traffic this time of day. Looks like it might rain. Does the missus live far from here? None of your business. - No. But looks were going the same way. What's it to you? - Ride with me. Ride? With you? You're pretty anxious. I was only talking about the car. Stop. I take taxis quite often. You don't have your own car? - I guess you could put it like that. Senorita. We could've gone all the way. Although schools give me shivers. No need to. Thanks anyway. Wait. Take that single with you. Why? You can listen to it before our date tomorrow. What date? The one that starts at 7 PM on the beach. We'll see about that. That's right. We'll see. In your dreams. As well, of course. All right, okay. Senor, what's the damage? Six twenty. - I can see that. But the situation is that I only have a fiver. And we're six miles from where I live. And the wrong way. You know. Listen. I don't know. When we move in together - our first beds could be those modern sofa beds. With no legs so we don't have to vacuum under the beds. Wouldn't that be quite bossy? Bossy? Yep. I guess. I don't know if you're at all serious. With me. I'm serious with you. Always have been. Since yesterday. Since the first time I saw you. You speak like that to every girl. - No, I don't. Only to every second girl. Really, we just met. That's right, we just met. But I feel like I've always known you. I think you feel the same. Right? You don't make much sense. - I don't? One doesn't have to. Some plans you have. Right. I hereby inform that to the headmaster himself. No need to call me that. Just call me engineer ViheriÃ¤vaara. I know all about your secret engagement. And now about your request to marry her. Correction; I'm not requesting. I'm just informing you. Kari Jalkanen. A homeless, unemployed street singer. No, an ex-ski jumper - now a printer and soon a recording artist. How nice. And even nicer is that now you walk out. And leave my daughter alone. We don't need a man like you in our family. Where I come from, the daughters are married to the man's family. I believe in two things. Higher powers and Pia. And this equation you don't seem to understand. We'll invite you to the wedding. Not compulsory to show up. Thank you. So long. Kari Jalkanen. What a fucking name. Flags and banners, flying high Wedding day, no time to cry Father-in-law's shouting why Let the priest drink us dry From a wooden cup Al right, wife. Shall we get to it? You're awful. Shouldn't we undress first? I mean the present envelopes. I was a bossy idea from you to ask money as presents. Ain't no bama. It's my money, honey. We'll have time for that later. The pike business first. What are you doing here? It's only 0630 AM. Not a hell of a lot here. And now I lost the count. I'll do it again. Is that what you are doing after the wedding night? It's not changing anything. I thought it'll be enough for an exhaust pipe and shock absorbers. But I guess we'll have to do with just the pipe. What? What did you just say? You heard me. The Anglia's exhaust pipe is a piece of junk. Our wedding present money doesn't fix that piece of junk. We'll buy linen and china. - No God damned way. Yes, God damn it! - No way! Then I'm out. Then you'll spend the first day of your marriage with your exhaust pipe. Piitu! Hey! Honey! We'll buy the china. And maybe longjohns for both of us. You're an asshole. - But a lovely asshole. Hey. I'm starting to make money for us. Doing gigs, writing songs. Fans. Thinking only about you when I sing. Only you. And a bit about the car parts. Play some polka! What? - Play some polka! So we can dance. We've paid for this. The ticket price was a fiver. We deduct the previous band. That leaves us with 70 or so pennies. I'll make it an even one mark. Take it and get the hell out of here. Other folk music fans in the house? Or can I carry on with the band? That's what I thought. One, two... We don't need those jerks. We have the best band around these parts. -The best band with zero gigs. Listen up. It's only a question of time before be make a record. I've sent out some demo tapes. Ours? But we haven't made one. - No, it was my own. Who's playing on it? -A few other guys. A really great band. They even get some radio time. But, but. When the call comes, we all go along. If the call comes. - When it comes. There's always light at the end of the track. It'll be OK. Do I look all right? - You're the boss. Must be. Going all the way to the big city to meet the big guy. I've waited for this like a soldier. See, it's not the pelvis. But the local Elvis. I'll keep my thumbs up. - No need to. They wouldn't ask me all the way there - if they weren't serious. Rock and rolling, you see. You can't go Close the door I feel so low Can't take it any more You must try, try, try You can't go, oh no You can't go, oh no You can't go, you can't go. Right. Not my thing. The song is always the product of the composer, in this case me - and the lyricist - in this case a talented young man. Then the singer makes it - his own, with his interpretation. Which in this case didn't happen. You mean I can't sing? A hicktown Elvis is always a hicktown Elvis. I guess you'd learn to even sing tango. But first you have to learn how to sing. For a baritone, your middle range is quite OK. In the lower scale - your flaw is the typical male bass. The tunes you produce are shuffling, too low. The upper scale is not too bad. A bit struggling, a bit too tight. Your greatest shortcomings are your vibrato and your timing. You're nasal. The vibrato should be more uptempo - and resonate only in a small area. So my vibrato is too wide. Out of control. Resembling certain ethnic minority groups. The worst combination is with the lower keys. Where my shuffling voice meets the ear vibration. Where have you been all night? - In Helsinki. Have you been drinking? - I've had a few. I was robbed. - What? They took my wallet. But here I am. - Did you call the police? They put me to the drunk tank. Gave me a fine. And told me to shut up. I asked would it help if I'd sing? I won't be a snitch. But I could sing about life. But... Did you ever make it to the music company? I did. Let me put it this way; the man who sits here - will never ever sing - a song written or arranged by that man I met. This awol day, which obviously was a colorful one - happened in a bad moment. - Right. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. - No, it won't. Swing by the office and pick up your last paycheck. Don't be like that. Listen. I mean... I'm pregnant. We're having a baby. How wonderful. I was fired. He's a lost and lonely man Been here far too long He's a racing king and fan But he's done things so wrong He's a lost and lonely man No one knows who to blame Wheelchair bound if he only can Well that's a crying shame He knows he'll never race again He's a lost and lonely man Been here far too long There. Right there. It kicks like a horse. Almost breaking my ribs. I'll smoke in the kitchen. Not to make you feel ill. You OK, dear? Yep. I'll get some sleep. - Okay. I'll check the newspapers. If there's any ads. Kari! Kari! My waters broke! Kari! - I see. Kari! -OK, I'm coming. God damn it. You're drunk. The car keys. They must be somewhere. We're not riding with you. - We? Who's we? Asshole. Piitu! Hello. -Why are you banging on our door, lush? I'll call the police. - No, no, my wife's giving birth. We need to get to the hospital. - Call a cab. I'm not your driver. I have no money. This one time only. We must hurry. Okay then. I'll find my shoes. Good. We'll wait here. You're not coming. - What? I'm ashamed. You can't come to the hospital. It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing. It's my child. I'll be a father. I'll be a father... Look how small it is. - It's big. Which one is it? - It's a boy. Then it's Jiri. Your name is Jiri. Just like Jiri Raska. A ski jumper from Czechoslovakia. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was like that. You know. If I wanted an easy man - I wouldn't have come close to you. That's why I attacked like a hungry pike. Yuck. You could've brushed your teeth. I can't be bothered. They hurt all the time. I wonder why? Because you don't take care of them. Isn't this something? My son. - Right. Mommy and daddy. A family. - A family. You know what that means. - Right. What? - That we support each other. I've done some thinking. - So have 1. All the record companies are in Helsinki. You're moving there. -What? Get a job in a printing house. And get your foot in the door. I'm not pushing myself to the record companies. -Yes you are. Well, how about you and Jiri? - I'll move in with your parents. We'll join you after you're started. Right? Why not? 1970's There. Oopsie-daisy. Hi. - Hi. Hi. - Hi. What? - Hi. Look at that. - What's this? "The Junior". Written by Kari Jalkanen. It's a single. This is your single! That's only the B-side. But it's my song. Written for me. Why haven't you told me, shithead? - It was a surprise. How could you keep it as a secret? Shall we play it? - Let's. We were doing mighty fine Doing well all the time Never ever out of the line Jiri, listen how daddy can croon. - Croon? Jesus, what language. A city boy. - I'll be damned. 8 years of slaving away and now I'm a recording artist. We have a rented flat. And we're here, all three. Soon four. This will be a hit song. You mean this could...? - Sure. It's a great song. Really cool lyrics. - By a great writer. Piitu! Piitu! The phone. Sorry. Sorry. Jalkanen. I am. How do you do? Yes, I know the address. Opposite the printing house. OK. Bye. Well? Who was it? The boss of D-Productions. The Big D! Danny! I have a feeling I'm getting into the big league now. You know? Kari. This song really sucks. But you sound pretty good. I'll make you an offer. Snake, Rattle and Roll tour. Three and half months. The biggest, hottest show in country. Interested? As a singer? - Mainly as a roadie. But you get to sing four songs a night. Sounds like a lot of work. Well, what's the pay? 50 marks per night. Plus 14 marks as per diems. You take care of your own food and board. I have a steady job at the printing house. I have to get the same money, at least. It's your own choice. Maybe you stay in the job and work your butt off until you retire. And I'll hire someone else for the snake tour. Are you talking about record company guys? Or you can take your chances. And start your way to the stars. With this salary, I'll have to hitch-hike there. Who are the screaming ladies coming to see? You or Danny? I need to gel a bit more money. We're having our second child in July. We're having our first one in July. Congratulations. Well, I have a suggestion. Are you afraid of snakes? Snakes? No. OK. 70 per night plus per diems. You're a roadie and a singer. And you also look after Elvis and The Prez. OK. - Bloody good. A few more things. That moustache, that's history. No way. Well, at least keep that tattoo covered. -No way. At least you must change your name. - No way. Kari Jalkanen. Sounds like a hillbilly. It's not commercial. And your name is? You must come up with a sexy stage name. I have sometimes used "Jami". - Jami Jalkanen? No, just Jami. - Jami. Absolutely not. What's your second name? -Tapani. Kari Tapani? No. Tapani Kari? No way. Kari Tapio? -Take your time. You'll come up with a decent one. Now, if you excuse me, I have work to do. Before you go, who are Elvis and The Prez? See you. This is The Prez. The gentle one. - The gentle one? Yep. Elvis is more unpredictable. Doesn't like domestic ants. They go under his skin, make him itchy. You must be careful with him. Especially when you feed him. Well, what does he eat? Mice? Rabbits. Hey, this one, hey this started... Hey dude! Pussinen! That Danny, he's a cool dude. He's the boss. It's so cool to be a part of a world-class act. Listen. One day you'll be a bigger star than he is. Sure. Did you get the poster I sent you? Yeah, it's really nice. It still has my old name. The printing house got the stage name too late. Where were you yesterday when I tried to call you? Well, what do you think? -I don't want to think. I want you tell me. Surprisingly, I wasn't anywhere beyond the sand box. With who? Who do you fucking think? - Oh, I see. Of course. Sure. Hey, your mommy told me there's a story about you in the local paper. About the new single? - About being in Danny-show. Well, what did they think about the single? -They haven't heard it yet. It doesn't get much radio time. They don't advertise it much. Do you sleep in hotels? - We can't afford that. I wouldn't be bringing home any bacon. Only Danny stays in hotels. Where do the rest of you sleep then? - In the bus. In the truck. Awful. Are you getting any sleep? I sleep like a log. It's pretty tough being on the road. OK then. We miss you a lot. Jiri's asking after daddy all the time. Are you washing your teeth every night? -Yes, mommy. You must be an example to Jiri. And to the new one. How else will they learn to look after their teeth? Right, I must hang up now. These calls are so expensive. I'll call again tomorrow. OK? - You don't have to call me every day. But I have to. How come I gel this sudden feeling you don't want me calling you? There we go again. You're delirious. I hang up now. Bye. Pia! Hey! What happened with the single? - Which one? The latest one. "Keep the secret". Just like the title implies. It was a kept as a secret. It came and went. One more flop. I have no gigs. My records don't sell. No one even notices when they come out. No one markets them. You can't make people to buy records. I'll give you a solid piece of advise. Don't give up your day job. What day job? I quit a year ago, when I went on the road with Danny. I'm running on empty here. Trying to make ends meet, on the dole. Swallow your pride and go back to the bakery. -Printing house. It ain't that easy. They've fired half of their staff. This bloody business. This is the way it works. If I only could get one decent single. To get me on my feet. Productionwise, it's a bit... But let me write this down. Let's try to find a new song for you. Any timetable? - No. Any chance of an advance? To get me on my feet? I have another meeting. If the kid's thirsty, the soda pop is on the house. See you. I've been thinking about... About what? To get a new livelihood. What? -At least until the singing starts paying our bills. Yep. No way. What do you mean no way? - No way. I have faith in you. Your faith doesn't feed the kids. Come on, for real. Don't overreact. No one's starving here. You must try harder. No one can succeed part-time. What more could I do? -Shape up. If they don't give you songs - you find them yourself. And offer them to Discophon. I'm not sure. Eat your soup! Shape up! Quitting is not an option. You sure haven't changed. - Neither have you. Unfortunately. Jiri. Have you seen this? Yuck! What are you thinking about? - What will we live on? I have already thought about that. No point of you wasting your talent. I'll get a decent job. - What decent job? The new social legislation will revolutionize the whole healthcare. What legislation? -You don't know anything about anything. The new law obligates dental care - for everyone under 17. That will create a lot of new jobs. I'll be a dental nurse. A dental nurse? Not a major surprise. But I have to think about our future. Hey, do you remember why we came here? To this suburb? For this flat? No, stupid. Where's the man - who's like a hungry pike? Show me that pike. Where's that pike? Let me have a look at that pike. Grr. Pikes don't growl like that. This one does. Ding dong, amore What do you say? I found it by chance. From an Italian tv-series. The theme song. This is a surefire hit. Let's get the Finnish lyrics asap. God damn it! What's the celebration? - No special reason. Let's celebrate us. Or your upcoming hit song. What upcoming hit? The one I took to the record company six months ago and never heard back? Maybe they didn't even translate the lyrics. -They'll do it. When they have the time. - I guess you're right. Again. Boys! Come and drink some juice! A long and lonely night I know you're going away I never promised it to you. I only said it's a certain hit. GrÃ¶n is one of our A-list artists. But it was me who found the song. It's perfect for my voice. Sure. And nothing stops you performing it on your gigs. But I don't have any! That song could've brought me some gigs. You must understand we can't give a song like that to you. Not after all your flops. I've had enough. I'll change the company. God damn it! With your track record... I feel like my career is going nowhere. No hits. Stuck like glue. Year after year. -Not for long. Welcome to Scandia. Here you can make an album of hits. An album? - Yep. We'll fill your almanac. And the stomachs of your kids. And maybe even your bank account. Paul Anka has written a new song for Sinatra. "Let me try again". That would sit nice with the new record. No, you're too young. The elderly have their own singers. We're aiming at younger audiences. We have already chosen the songs for your LP. - I see. We want to play it safe with you. - OK. That hairdo is cool. Let it grow. Next time dye it blonde, the same way. Actually, it's my natural color. - Of course. Well, don't change it. We'll take the cover pictures. BTW, Chrisse will produce your record. Chrisse? She's good, she's really good. -She's the best. OK. That's the song list. - Good. What the hell? They're all Danny's old songs. Right. All old hits that everyone knows. Makes no sense to record Danny's old songs. Scandia wants to recycle the background tracks. It's your record. No one else's. Don't worry. I'll fade Danny's voice out. I don't want to be a bloody backup-Danny. I want to record new songs. That haven't been heard in this country. Chrisse, I'm serious. I can't sing old songs to old background tracks. This is the way it goes. Don't worry too much. Just sing better than Danny. People will rush to the record shops. And to your gigs. It's like shitting in one's own nest. I'm experienced enough - to know how this business works. - God damn it. You either sing these songs or don't work for us at all. Right. You have now published your first LP. Congratulations. - Thanks. It's been a long wait. We have a double celebration here. Pia graduated as a dental nurse. Thanks to the new social laws. - Don't start about that, stupid. Come on. It's as important as this. You see, I follow things outside music business. -Right. You said it's been a long wait. - Yes. It's been my dream for at least 13 years. That's why it feels a bit strange - that this anticipated first record has only Danny's hit songs. You even sing them the same way. Don't get insulted - but it feels you want to be Danny II. Absolutely not. The coffee's ready if you'd... Let's take the picture first. Pia, sit next to Kari. A nice family portrait. Even your hair is dyed Danny-style. And your clothes are the same way. Is the record some sort of revenge on Danny - because you never worked with him since the snake tour? Let me get the facts straight. The songs were chosen by the company. I choose my own clothes. My hair is dyed by the sun. Write that down, bloody hell. Let's take that picture now. "Now I realize it was a mistake to record Danny's repertoire. Talking about my hair, the sun does it to me every summer. I buy my own clothes from public stores. So I'm not imitating anyone. ...cleaning up his questionable reputation." Not quite the marketing article the company wanted. The whole record was a mistake. Well? What's the plan? So, you want to be a star? I don't want to be a star. I want to work in the music business and support my family. I guess we can fix that. Along with the stardom. Let me only say this: watch your mail. How secretive. - It is. Coming up; "Sing My Love Song" in Finnish. Only two more weeks and it's out. Widely waited, lovingly lusted, always anticipated. Sung by the guy with the praised voice. Only one thing has been missing. - The thing they call the hit song. But now it's Kari Tapio's turn. The Finnish name of the song is still a secret but we'll find it out soon. The single will be out in September. So, let the weeks roll past. "With informative regards, Scandia Music. Chrisse Johansson." How wonderful. Sing my love song Chrisse ordered the lyrics from a guy - who's also Fredi's producer. So the guy took the text first to Fredi and then to us. And Fredi cut a record. Which will be published a day after your version. God damn it. Fredi sells almost as much as Danny. Actually, a bit more. He's the most popular domestic artist of the decade. Fucking guys! It's over. - Nothing's over! Let's get the big guns out. Proper marketing. We'll put out a collection of hits. New hits. Upcoming hits. It's wartime! Sing my love song Sing my love song Sing my love song Bitter fight over hits. Will Kari Tapio stop Fredi's career? Sing my love song Try to remember to feel stronger The days will be longer Sing my love song Sing my love song Kari Tapio on charts. Where's Fredi? I'll put a nickel in the jukebox And play the Truck Drivin' Man The waitress just brought Me some coffee I thanked her but Called her again 1980's Drinking away, way too much Nothing really works for me Water's the only drink I can touch Too little's too much to be Cut it. Let's have a break. Promised too much, way too much, No way I can ever be true I feel I've lost my my touch Except my love, now I'm so blue That was it. - That was it. And your own version which tells us you have a way with words - you can sing on your own notorious private gigs. Pisses me off to sing these whining love songs. I'm a Finnish craftsman, not a Japanese haiku singer. I know. Your version is much better. OK, see you at nine. We'll do "Julia". That's a good song. But I guess it won't be the hit I'm longing after. You can never tell. We're one song short. And then the album's done. What could that song be? - Don't know. We'll figure out something. - We'll figure it out. Well, so long. Play the new song. What's this? -A new song we found from Midem in Cannes. We'll cut it a bit later. We don't have the lyrics yet. We don't yet know which way to go. It should be something strong. Something real. Finnish. Right, I could talk to the lyricist. That's a good direction. Hell of a melody. Smells like a hit. Who'd do this? -The company was thinking about Danny. Or Tapani Kansa. Give it to me. I'm not sure. Why? - It's perfect for my voice. It's perfect for him, too. I'm just thinking about the facts. - You mean you're the best singer? I have the biggest tab in the house. I owe the company a hell of a lot of money. Plus the royalty advances. Well, that's true. I'll talk to the brass. We could think about the lyrics. All right. - How could it go? Give me the background tracks on a compact cassette. -You got it. Au revoir. - He sure knows his Italian. This is good. Pretty good. Really? - This is a bossy song. What? - No one says that any more. Bossy? - I just said. After I cut this, the money will start rolling in. Maybe I could write songs to other singers as well. Get going now. Veikko! -Klabbi, damn it. In time, for a change. I couldn't get any sleep. About that song... - What's this? Lyrics to the song they've found. Who wrote this? You? Damn good you didn't. I have some great news for you. We already have hell of a text for it. We could rehearse right away. Cool, huh? Cool. -Cool. Do you want that song or not? -of course I do. With this song you can bury your haiku-fears. What's the title? All right. Okay. Good evening. My name is Kari Tapio. And I'm a Finnish man. Under the North Star Under the blue clear sky I sing about life and that is why I'm a Finnish man Oh if they'd only know out there What it's like to be in here, where With our tears running wild the oceans running dry All those lonely nights But always so much forbidden love The stories, the joy they're bringing All the poems and songs I'm singing "I'm a Finnish Man" takes Finland by storm Kari Tapio "I'm a Finnish Man" Under the North Star Under the blue clear sky I sing about life and that is why I'm a Finnish man I sing about love A man and and a woman I'm a child from above I'm a Finnish man Cut. That was it. Was that it? - Yep. Was it any good? - It was real good. Did the door sway too much? It felt pretty good to me. Drive carefully. - Always. Call me when you get there. - Yep. When you get where exactly? - Hicktown. Bigtown. Well, some place somewhere. And remember... - To wash my teeth. Yeah, yeah. See you in a week or so. In short, so long. OK doggie, you're in charge here. I know all the turns and corners Of the highway number four Starlets of the night and mourners Nights of weary bars and more All the jails, judges and byways Every hotel, barn and inn All the roads, trails and highways No matter where I've been With open eyes, hammer all down Makes me think every once in a while Been in every village, city and town If this is the very last time If there's a wide open road And a tank full of gas Just like going around in the same fucking circle. It's me. - Why do you call at this hour? Am I interrupting something? - My sleep. Good thing the boys didn't wake up. It's a school day tomorrow. Right. How's the little one? He's good. They all miss their dad. - Right. What? Has something happened? - No. I just can't sleep. I miss you. Al sorts of thoughts in my mind. - You always have. You're my true love My friend My love, my dear, my wife Without you my world ends For the rest of my life Thank you. All right. Okay. Good evening. Senor Big Pike. How are we doing here? Let's roll. All right. Okay. The wagons are rolling. Reiska. Listen. Listen. Two weeks in Spain. Yeah, yeah. we'll find the time. The wives are there for one week only. Then we stay for another one... Hillsides, hillsides Hillsides, hillsides Hillsides, hillsides Mr. Singer. I should clean up the room. The next guest is waiting. Fill the minibar. I have a four o'clock... Winter's been long and lonely Ice won't stop me, if I only knew Darkness won't scare me if only You are there to help me through I love you always, over seasons For a million different reasons What the hell? For fuck's sake. Where are the boys? Huh? At school? -They're at your mom's. Why not at school? Why are you not at work? -It's Christmas break. Christmas? Where are the decorations? No tree. No ham this time. And I wonder why? What do you think? I told your mom we'll show up. That you have gigs until the Christmas Eve. Like you bloody did. You've been gone for a week. People have been calling here, worried as hell. Reijo Taipale and Junnu Vainio. You were supposed to be in the studio last week. I'll take care of it. And I'll do my gigs. On my own expense. When will you fucking understand that there's not such a thing? It's all away from this family. You've taken money from the home loan account. How do we pay the mortgage? Your tax debts? We have unpaid bills for over ten grand. We'll buy a cheaper car. Car! What a jolly idea! Where is our car anyway? The Merc? You came home in a taxi. I'll find it. - Swell. Do you know what? The worst thing is not your endless boozing. Blowing away all our money. Piitu. Honey. - If this letter is true - that's the worst thing. Read it. Read it! No. I know what's there. So, it's true? Yep. But you must understand... I'm the one who has to understand? You are screwing another woman - and I'm taking care of the kids. And I'm the one who has to understand? You have to understand it was nothing. -Nothing? How awesome. How about if it would've been something? You are playing house with someone else. All right then. Let's split. God damn it. So you get the fuck away from me. No way. You're not getting away that easily. We're not divorcing. How dare you, asshole? Forgive me. I'm a terrible sack of shit. I'm sorry. I love you. I love you. Don't you fucking touch me. The boys don't need to know about this. They still worship you. They don't need to know what an asshole their dad is. But... -There's no buts. This is the way it goes. Are we clear? Will you forgive me? I don't know. And it doesn't make any difference. But you only have one family. Joona-Poona and Nakke. Merry Christmas, dudes. Damn. Tight collars. Tight collars. All right. That family is us. You're not breaking that family. Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Mommy's dear. Your mother... is so proud of you. Dad... I'm an alcoholic. I can't drink anything. - I know. I see. - Pia hasn't said a word. But I'm not blind. Fathers know their sons. Always. For me, it's over. For good. I want to give my sons a safe childhood. Happy New Year then. Don't shoot me. Cut it out. Wave to me. Run from there. Wave it around. Piitu, Happy New Year. From now on, Joona will come with you on the road. What? The road's no place for a kid. Why not? If you're serious with your promises. Of course I am. But... - Agreed then. End of story. Piitu, listen... Listen, no more talking. Now it's time for action. Right? Right? OK. Wave to me! We've bought banners from every town. -Wow. We can put them on the wall when you come home. We are up north. Daddy's singing pretty soon. Hey, let daddy say a few words. Daddy wants to talk. Right. Bye. Hello. - You've been OK? Really OK. I had to sing "The Finnish Man" three times last night. People don't seem to get enough of it. I guess that's better than howling slimy love songs night after night. What kind of band you have tonight? - Quite OK. The notes were not upside down. The guitar strings had no knots in them. Nice. How's the little man? - Everybody's spoiling him. Candy, soda pop, ice cream all the time. He's put on a few pounds. See that he also gets decent food. And...-We'll wash our teeth. You'll be home tomorrow? Yep. We'll head home straight after breakfast. Nice. See you them. Don't let Joona stay up too late. I'll tuck him in and head for the venue. Good night. - Good night. Where was it again? Here. See, daddy was born here. Have I told you? The sports club. The inner lane. I'm a Finnish man Thank you. Next an old classic - from the songbook of the old master. "Vagabond's Evening Star". D-minor, with the left foot. One, three... Now I lay me down to sleep - I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake - I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen. Daddy? Just get some sleep. I'll be right back. OK? Are you going to sing again? - No, just seeing some old friends. Go to sleep. Good night. - Good night. I'm leaving my heart behind It's time for me to go away So cold is the fall and twined So little chance for me to stay I'm leaving my heart ahead This is where it belongs Time for me to rest my weary head To the whisper of all these songs Summer nights, maybe the last drink Wind whispers gently to the shore If you trust more Than you think there's... Sorry, Pia. This was the last time. I swear. - Don't fucking swear. How much did you spend? Pretty much. Everything I had. - There we are. This was the last time. Now I've realized how to put things together. Don't say a word. - No, really. When I was on the wagon this spring - I realized how happy we were. How well this family was. The boys even got better grades. Bring in the Bible, I swear it's over now. Really. Never again. Never. I think it was fair to come out with my problem and not hide it anymore. It was. It is manly to speak about your drinking problem to the media. But businesswise, whining like that it's not so great. No one wants to book you any more. You're the national celebrity drunk a 2. God damn it, I haven't had a drop in three months. -Fucking great. Hey, if I do a hundred gigs well and then miss a few - I think I'm not treated fair here. Look, you must understand that the promotors fear - that their gig is the one you can't pull off. See, no one trusts an alcoholic. He lay face down in the desert sand Clutching his six-gun in his hand Shot from behind, I thought he's dead Under his heart was an ounce of lead But a spark still burned So I used my knife And late that night I saved the life of Ringo Kari. Kari, for real. I want to sleep. Can you stop now? The days went by, he mended fast Then from dawn till setting sun He practiced with that deadly gun No human being could match the draw of Ringo The inner lane! Strange you can't sing in your own house. Officers, attention! Let's sing! Under the North Star I'm the Finnish man Everyone else has a burn-out but I have a burn-in! Hey neighbor, how do you do? I'm doing great! Hey Piitu! Piitu! I'll never forget you! 1990's What, what city is this? - Lahti. Lahti? A White Russian... I don't think that's a good idea. - Thanks. Thanks. Bloody hell. This is not police business. -He hasn't paid his bill for two weeks. Just the minibar is over 4000. Pia. I think... I promise that... I'm leaving you. We're moving out. Pia. - I'll take my maiden name back. I don't want to have your name any more. You promised not to leave me. Not to break this family. There's no family to break any more. You've broken it already. I love you. I love you. I can't make it without you. I can't make it alone. I won't make it alone. After the very last night I've made up my mind I'm sticking to my call Crying won't help me at all Closing the doors and falling You must understand my calling Never, never No, give the phone to Pia. Give the phone to Pia. Give it to Pia. Open up, it's Reiska! Open up, it's Reiska! What? What? Open up, it's Reiska. Who the hell is Reiska? Reiska. Reiska Taipale. The local lumberjack. - What the hell? I don't know any Reiska. Are you coming? - Get the hell our of here. Not a nice thing to say to an old buddy.-Get the fuck out now. Open the damn door or I'll kick it in. Why is the man crying? - Everything. Everything's gone. The gigs are down the drain. Pia walked out on me. Do you remember what Junnu used to say? -What did he use to say? Have you killed someone? No. No, I haven't. Can you still get it up? Yeah, yeah, yeah. -Well, there we are. Nothing to worry about. Pia left me. Ask her back and she'll come back. - She won't. Pull yourself together and she'll come back. How? -You could start with cleaning up this pigsty. This was it. - Pull yourself together. Hi, lie. It's Kari. Err, my family walked out on me a while ago. I don't have a record company or an agent. And the taxman is on my heels. Any chance of co-operation? Sure. Haul your ass over here for a pow-wow. Tuesday at 10 OK with you? Of course it is. See you then. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Guess I was the last boy on the line The pressure sure was down on me I thought I was doin' mighty fine All or nothing, the way it used to be Time pulled the rug From under my feet You're like dental caries. Once you got it, you never get rid of it. What a nice thing to say. You haven't done anything in here. You haven't even vacuumed. Piitu. - What? Put that on the door. Where are the boys? Getting groceries. We knew there's nothing in here. Right. What about the song? The lyrics I sent you. I wrote them. Did you like them? Was that so hard on your manhood? What? - Putting that doorsign up. How come? - You're all sweaty and pale. A bit of a heartburn. Did you say something? God damn it. Damn it. Kari. Kari. Kari. Oh my God. Kari. Kari. Pia. I'm sorry. I promise there will be a change. For real. For good. Kari. - I'll do whatever you want me to do. I'll join the AA. Whatever you want. Don't leave me. - Kari. You haven't been drinking. You had a stroke. You almost died. Well, that was it then. What? - The music's over. No, it's not. You'll be OK. Time to turn out the lights. - No, you'll get over this. I'm so sleepy. I'm sleepy. The doctor said you'll be OK. But you have to change your ways. Change living into dying. - Shut up. We haven't come all this way to watch you giving up. Well, what could I do? - Start your own band. Who'd play in it? - Well, at least me. And Jani. Joona will be the manager. He'll sell our gigs. Right. Finally, you'll get your own band. -His orchestra. Who's? - His. His orchestra. Kari Tapio and his orchestra. That's the name of the band. Hallelujah! And you? What are you doing? I'm behind the wheel. So you don't have to drive any more. Are you planning to quit your day job? - I already have. We're a family business. Klabbi Ltd. Right. Let's roll. Out of the the shadows Into the light Can't make it without you Even if I tried There's no more darkness, No more night When you're walking there, Always by my side Out of the the shadows, Into the light With humble minds That's my Well, look at this. The gold where you can see it. Hi. I have an appointment with lie. He's still in the previous meeting. Have a seat, I'll bring you coffee. OK, thanks. Could you bring some water for the dog please? We'll sit here and wait. Hi. - Hi. Hi, Klabbi. Sorry to keep you waiting. Danny just bumped in. But not to worry, grab the cat and walk right in to my humble abode. Hey, how do you feel? Pretty good, thanks. Never been in better shape. - Good to hear. Things have changed. -What? Are you signing with someone else? No, careerwise it's the same. But for the first time I want my own band. And yes, the wife's back. She'll be my driver. That's great stuff. A cool raport. - So it is, thanks. Well, how about it? Would you be interested in a voice like this? Would I? Hell, yes. Listen, I already scribbled our agreement. Just check out if you're OK with all the percents and permilles. Don't need to, I trust you. Give me a pen and I'll sign. I'll just add one more clause. PS. See you in court. A company man! Welcome to the club! God damn it, what are these? Ostrich skin boots. For you. To seal our deal. God damn it. Pretty cool slippers. They are rougher than my face. You have a bad skin but a good heart. Just like your old man. Bloody hell. Well, why not? Look at these lyrics. If they're any good. -Give them to me and I'll have a look. After I'm gone. So I don't feel embarrassed. OK. - I must be going. So long. - So long. Oh, one more thing. Never keep me waiting because of Danny-Boy. After the storm, the rain is gone Now I see that I see the dawn We don't know our fate The time is getting late After the storm, the rain is gone The sun is back, high above One day I'll find the haven, faraway The end of the rainbow, I will stay See what happens when you start hiding my cognac. Going out dressed like that? -A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. My slippers have seen fancier places. They'll be OK for the corner pub. Kari. What if I'd open the cognac and you'd stay home? Piitu. What's the damage if I pop out to have a few? See some real life. In the old days I could drink for a week. Now one night is quite enough. A week was never enough for you. You should be honest about your drinking. Yeah, yeah. I always have come back. Like a boomerang. And will this time, too. So long. - So long. Piitu. I love you. Always. Remember, wherever I may roam, I'll never forget you. Like my tattoo says. Without you, I wouldn't be here. - Right. Without the boys. And without the fans. - Get going. No one listens to that. Au revoir. - Right. What if we'd open the cognac? Just the two of us. DECEMBER 5th, 2010 Let's go. -Listen. Listen. I never get enough of this. We'll be running out of songs. - Jonde-Ponde. Tonight we're not running out of songs. Let's roll. Way to go, dudes. Damn it! Piitu's calling. Hello. Hell of a gig. No, I'm already in a taxi. Heading home. See you soon. Yep. Yep. I'm so God damn tired. This is the best day in my life. Thank you. Thank you very much. There's always sun, even behind the darkest clouds. "After the storm".
