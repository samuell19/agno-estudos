Versailles, July 14th 1789 Sidonie. What time is it? It's Louison. Six fifteen. What do you want? Can I see the clock? - For the hundredth time? - Come on. Go away. Can I come in? Guess who I slept with. I don't care. You'll end up an old maid! Go away! FAREWELL, MY QUEEN The Queen wants me at the Trianon. - She slept there? - Her choice. Jasmine or violet? Violet. How is Madame de Bargue? She vomited all night. The more he cheats, the more she eats. Thanks, Alice. I feel much better. Forgetting something? Hurry up! 10 minutes late! Why did we lend you Mr. Janvier's clock? Sorry, Madame Campan. And you're filthy. - Did Her Majesty sleep well? - No, in fact. A terrible nightmare. Madame de Soubise found her in tears. - What will you read? - Marivaux. Forget it. I'd suggest... Bossuet's "Funeral Orations". - Marie-Th?r?se of Austria's? - Perfect. The Queen takes comfort in all things Austrian. Mademoiselle Laborde! And so early. How can I show my gratitude? For Her Majesty I'd take longer journeys, if she so desired. I know how fully devoted you are. Come closer. A cup of coffee. Try this treasure from the isles. Every mouth that tastes it, smiles. See that? I made a rhyme. Burn your tongue? Barely, Your Majesty. It is delicious. Take your time, mademoiselle. What do you wish to read to me? I was thinking... Bossuet's oration for Marie-Th?r?se. How dismal! Poor woman spent her life bored stiff. Know what she said on her deathbed? "Since I've been Queen, I've known only one day of happiness!" And no one ever knew which one. No, please. Find me something a little... ...a little frivolous. I also thought of "The Life of Marianne". Chapter two. When Valville bumps into her after Mass. I'm fine with Marivaux. But I prefer plays to novels. Go get... ..."F?licie" from my library. Right away, Your Majesty. So? It's all going wonderfully. I'm off to the library. "It certainly is a fine day. "We've been walking for a long while. "The pleasure of being with you... "... which is always great, has never been so intense. "I do believe you love me, Felicie. "Do you, Madame? "What? "You've only become aware of this now? "You, the source of all things worthy in my heart and soul? "You've always been the object of my..." Why are you scratching so much? Mosquito bites. Let me see. I'm sorry. Augustine! Fetch Madame Campan. Know where they come from? The swamp! To think it's with that stagnant water that we wash ourselves. I hear there are even rats. Disgusting! Your Majesty sent for me. Yes, Madame Campan. Be so kind... ...as to fetch some rosewood water for Mademoiselle Laborde. It's all so repulsive. If it keeps up, we'll soon live in a sewer. I truly am sorry. Would you like to return to "F?licie"? That's enough. Read from the fashion magazines. Wasn't it you who brought it? I'm listening. "Dresses are trimmed with silver and gold. "The preferred ornaments of the day... "... are made of tulle or mesh... "... with garlands of various flowers... "... attached by clasps shaped as lover's knots." Go on. "Chinese tassels are then added,... "... or horns of plenty, flowing with flowers..." Further on... the embroidery. "Embroidered linen camisoles in various colors... "... have been forsaken in favor of embroidered dresses..." I have an idea for my dresses! Have Madame d'Ossun bring my finery book. An embroidery... of a dahlia. See? Yes, Madame Campan? I forgot! Give it to me. Excellent promptness. Show me your arm. How scandalous! Pretty little arm, perfectly pudgy. Rosewood water... ...is very good at soothing itches. I no longer feel a thing. Madame d'Ossun! Come closer. Give me my notebook. I have a fabric here that would work fabulously... ...with this embroidery idea... Here. Ask what Madame Bertin thinks. Just heavenly. Scratching yourself before the Queen? We will discuss this! Are you really Italian? Can't you hear? A grand Venetian family. What's it about? It's best you never know. - Why not? - It's a love song. How unoriginal. The Duchess! Know Gabrielle de Polignac? The entire court knows her. I'm not of the court, but I hear things. The Queen is infatuated. And supposedly Gabrielle de Polignac... ...takes no heed of her husband. Very loose morals. No concern of mine. I should know. She loves our gondola rides. Can you row faster? You'll see. She'll dismiss her maid to see me. Last time she wanted to see "il mio cazzo". Know what that is? I don't want to. - Your name? - Shut up now. Can you please turn around? Shall I accompany you, Duchess? No need, Madame Tournon. Nothing to fear with Paolo. How is the Queen? Excellent spirits. It seems bread is getting scarcer and scarcer in Paris. That's how the wolves leave the forest. What nonsense are you talking now? What I hear all over. You're rambling. At my age, I look at the truth straight on. The truth is, we're safe at Versailles. Ever tell the Queen you sew? Of course not. To end up her permanent embroiderer? But Marie-Antoinette prefers finery to books. I won't see her again. The thought of it is unbearable. I hate this job,... ...and my mistress for dumping it on us. You're twice as fast! Don't stain the trees. We'll say they're giant poppies. And my back hurts. And I'm hungry. Enough of this unending tapestry! For me, it's like a journey to a faraway land. I know how the Queen can stare at her finery for hours. That's when she forgets she's Queen. I never forget who I am. Batty, you and her both! You know a boy named Paolo? Gondolier at Petite Venise? He's Ren?. He's been there two weeks. But he speaks Italian. He's a penniless actor, a natural-born liar. Watch out. True, he's pleasing to the eye. He milks it for all it's worth. "Cazzo". Know that word? Really want to know? Cock. I said to watch out. Enough whispering! I'd say it aloud, but your ears are too prudish. - Louison has a new lover. - I know. Until the next one. His name is Gustav. Grenadier in a Swiss regiment. They're taking up arms. I was told. Gustav only speaks German. We go about it no questions asked! The priests... Time to confess! Have you pretty girls ever drunk ratafia? Glasses for all! We just had dinner with Cardinal de Montmorency. 80 desserts minimum,... ...not counting the candied fruits, competes,... ...ice cream and nougatine. I love candied citron. I know your appetite... ...for the angelic lolly. How about a little cuddle? Just a kiss on the neck. Gaspard! Got your violin? Play a country dance. To King Louie's health! I know the names of the new government! Names! I love names! Want to hear some? Princess de Lamballe,... ...Superintendent of the Queen's Household. Countess d'Ossun, Mistress to the Queen's Clothes. I saw her today. Count d'Hassonville, Wolfcatcher Royal. Princess de Chimay, lady-in-waiting. The ladies who accompany Madame. The ladies of Mesdames... Versailles, July 15th 1789 Sidonie! Open up. It's Louison. They woke the King up! They say it's diarrhea. Is he ill? My cousin, his first valet, sleeps at the foot of his bed. What does he say? That the King ate bad cod-fish. Impossible. I know his chamber boy. Before bed, the King spoke of hunting. Have you heard the news? Someone woke the King at 2 o'clock. I brought you some water. - Madame de Bargue told you? - No, Honorine. - Does the Queen know? - Go ask her. I have to get back. Call that bread? Some people make it last a week. So? Do you know anything? I would, if I spoke English. An Englishman woke the King? When it's serious, M. and Mme. de la Tour de Pin use English. I heard the word "Bastille"... four times. Something bad happened there. An escape, or a fire... I'll ask Gustav. Monsieur Moreau will know and he speaks French! Tell us. If I'm allowed to. Mademoiselle Laborde! Madame Bertin needs you. I'll see to the Queen's return. It's a bit delicate. I'll explain. Marie-Louise, my embroiderer, is ill... ...and the Queen asked that we make a dahlia sampler. You know the Queen. When she wants something, she gets so impatient,... ...it makes me dizzy. Madame Campan thinks I get bored when not reading? Madame Campan thinks you're a good embroiderer. For her, it's the same thing. Not for me. I envy your loving books the way you love them. In due time, I'll tell the Queen you embroidered it. Out of the question. She doesn't know I sew. You'll do it? One condition. About Marie-Louise's pay? It's not about money. Last night's events. Madame Campan must know something. I swore. I won't repeat it. Sorry, but... ...I didn't hear. The people stormed the Bastille. The Queen was told this morning. She asked de Breuil to march on Paris with a foreign regiment. The Count d'Artois is backing her. The King's brother? The King is very angry with him. He is taking counsel now. It's very serious, Sidonie. And make sure you tell no one! Sweet Jesus. I'd lose the Queen's favor. Come. I'll give you her finery book. Mme d'Ossun won't know. How long do you need for the sampler? Just a small dahlia, to give Her Majesty an idea. Am I bothering you? You never bother me, Mademoiselle Laborde. You've come for news? Alas, I've heard the brunt of it. Monsieur de Barentin, who just left, gave me the details. Don't just stand there. Take my chair. Have a seat. Here's the story. Yesterday at dawn,... ...a munitions convoy heading to the Bastille... ...was attacked by rioters,... ...who, afterwards, pillaged the Invalides arsenal. Enough to arm the people,... ...who then headed en masse... ...to the Bastille. The French Guard put up a bitter fight,... ...but in vain. The prison commander, Monsieur de Launey, was beheaded. Many Swiss Guards... ...hanged or killed. And who was being detained in the royal jail? Four forgers, two lunatics... ...and a deviant confined at his family's request. I'm speechless. There's nothing left to say. The damage is done. Rebellions will burst out all over the kingdom. No fun being a King's soldier nowadays! So it's true. Someone did wake up the King. The Duke de La Rochefoucauld had the honor. And the misfortune. What will happen to us? You promise? Don't tell anyone I have her finery book. Cross my heart. Look. The dahlia I'm making. This way, Madame... - What are they saying? - It's in English. I heard "Polignac" twice. Gabrielle? You call her Gabrielle? Why? We call her "Duchess"? Duchess, my ass! She played her cards right. What cards? Don't you start too. From country bumpkin to the Queen's favorite? What do you call it? I say she's a whore. You sound like your mistress. Everyone says so. She brings the Queen joy. Quiet or I'll leave. You know what she does with Paolo. Shut up now! The King! What on earth? Come look! It's the King! He's leaving the chateau. On foot. He's running away? His brothers are following him. They don't look thrilled. Where are they going? He doesn't have his feathered hat. Look at his brother... He almost slipped! He'd bounce with that fat ass! I'm going closer. - Coming? - What if Madame rings? Say the Bastille was stormed! This is torture. No, my brother. It's a necessity. You do everything backwards. If my master saw me! - Monsieur de la Tour de Pin is a deputy. - And? I bet he'll negotiate with Bailly. - Negotiate what? - Enough of your questions! Let me through. Louison! Come meet my Gustav. Sidonie Laborde, the Queen's reader. - Assistant. - Too complex for him. What a mustache! Can he get us in? Now you act all nice! What's in it for me? I'll lend you the clock for a night. You'd do that? Go on. It is what my heart desires. My most fervent wish. The reward I expect for my good intentions... ...and my love for my people. Not coming to dinner? Already? What time is it? Where's the clock? I lent it to Louison. That's pretty. Who's it for? A very dear friend. Do I know her? Madame is constipated. She won't eat. How about "bouch?es ? la reine"? I'm not hungry. What will you do? Wait. Wait for what? For the Queen to send for me. On an empty stomach? I'm afraid, Alice. I'm afraid for her. Bouch?es ? la reine! How you spoil me! I was just going to have some lentils. Careful. Excuse me, but it's dark. Indeed... ...darker and darker. I even feel that night has fallen faster than usual. My God. It's been ages since I ate this. You work too much. Your eyes and health will suffer. The recent events make me suffer. It's all happening too fast. The King was cheered. The King was cheered because he spoke standing, without a hat. They didn't cheer a king,... ...but a citizen like any other. It's delicious. You know what hurts me most, Mr. Moreau? The malice concerning the Queen. I know your fervor for Marie-Antoinette. Not at all. I'm just her servant. What am I saying? The servant of the books of Her Majesty's library. No fervor in that. So young... ...and already blind. Your love for the Queen... ...makes you too indulgent as to her caprices. Gabrielle de Polignac is a folly... ...which cost her dearly. She's yet to finish paying for it. I don't want you meeting the wrong people. Moreau! Tell me. Where are our maids? I've been ringing for an hour and no one answers. No one comes. It's unbearable! Marquis, I imagine they're as lost as their masters. The Marquis has been living in a rat hole for 10 years. And I hear his chateau is breathtaking. Just to see the King in the Hall of Mirrors twice a week. And that's if he's lucky. Moreau... just in time. What of the rioters planning to attack Versailles? How long until they get here? Twelve hours? Fifteen? Has the King made arrangements? Make your own in the meantime, M. de Jolivet. The people are a fabric that is highly combustible. I have to organize our defense. Finally I'm going to stay here. Here? What an absurd idea. In my room I'll never sleep. In that case, I'll be going. Thank you for that impromptu dinner. It was marvelous. But the one thing I did regret,... ...a bottle of wine. I totally forgot. Shall I go ask? Don't go out of your way. I'll go myself. I need to stretch my legs. In the end... ...people think I'm wise, but I'm... ...no different from others. It's just a pamphlet... ...but you can see what's going on under our very noses. Mademoiselle Laborde... ...if ever you see the Queen,... ...inform her of this scandal. Can you read it? It's the list,... ...of the 286 heads... ...that must be cutoff... ...to bring about necessary reform. The first two names... ...are those of the Queen, ...and the Count d'Artois. Then... Then? The Duchess de Polignac. And the Princess... ...de Lamballe. I am... ...the twenty-first head... ...they want to cutoff. Monsieur Moreau! Sidonie. The world's not over yet but... You've drunk too much. The Queen is in danger. When the worm is in the apple... Move! They're looking everywhere for you. Who is'? The wolf. Who wants me? I'll leave you two. I'll go to the service quarters. Cooking wine is sour but... ...it will do. What do you want? You know. You want the same thing. Come with me. He saw his name on the list and fainted. Hurry. It would be easier in my shack. Let me do it. You prefer Gabrielle de Polignac? I've been thinking about you since yesterday. Sidonie Laborde. Stay here. Show yourself and I won't see you again. Alice! The Queen's page boy is looking for you! Good God! I kept the Queen waiting! You weren't in your room, mademoiselle. Gross misconduct with all this unrest. We'll discuss it later. The Queen is sorting through her papers. No need to read to her. Write down the names of some books,... ...a dozen at most,... ...she should take with her to the country. The Queen is going away? No questions, please. I'd be more comfortable doing so in the library. No one cares about your comfort. The library and the annex will be full of baggage. Go into her bath quarters. I'm busy with Mme de Rochereuil. The Queen doesn't need this. I'll get a good price. Not so loud. Enough of being scorned. We're human beings just like her. Even in a position of weakness, she acts so superior. Don't you agree, Henriette? Rereading her lovers' letters,... ...we'll be here until morning. She burnt a lot of them. The list of her expenses too,... ...especially money spent on the Polignacs. This white silk camisole. Not her style, don't you agree? We'll split it 50-50. I'll have no pan of that. You're wrong not to pick up crumbs. Believe me, you'll regret it soon enough. Ask your brother. He's telling everyone how kings disgust him. Keep quiet. Keep quiet. You think so? It's my job. I know her taste better than you. We'll find out right away. Why are you staring at me? Close the door. The Queen wants you. Mademoiselle Laborde is at your disposal. Leave us alone. You were here and I didn't know. They hide everything from me. It's unbearable. Come closer. I need your help. Helping you is my greatest desire, Majesty. I know how much I can count on you. Your discretion does you credit. What I'm asking shouldn't take you long. In the library you'll find books about geography... ...with detailed maps. Map out the best route... ...from Versailles to Metz. Abbe' Cornu de Baliv?re! Madame! This is being passed around the chateau. This is why I'm preparing to leave for Metz. Count Esterhazy will join us with his regiment. In Metz we'll gather troops and march on Paris. Pure treachery how this city gives orders to the King! And to France! Paris is not France. What does the King think? He thinks the same as me. Metz has a powerful citadel. It's a wise choice. As for that pamphlet, pay it no attention. It is as foul-smelling as manure,... ...as is everything from Paris. The King is asking his brothers for advice. Tonight. Tomorrow at the latest. Let the King do as he pleases. For now, at least. The Duke de Bourbon fled on horseback disguised as a groom. I will go disguised as the Queen of France! Leave me now. Good night, Madame. God, how I'm tired. I'm totally lacking in energy. The idea of travelling gives me a backache. Are you still here? Yes I am, Your Majesty. Close the door and come closer. Come here, so I can see you. Take that seat. You know what I find charming about you? Not so much the prettiness of your features... ...as the youth you radiate at all times. But Your Majesty, you're so young. I was. I have a question. I'll answer all Your Majesty's questions,... ...insofar as I am able. Have you ever been attracted by a woman,... ...to the point that you suffer in her absence? I can spend hours imagining her... ...with my eyes closed: her oval face... ...the softness of her skin... ...the merry sparkle of her eyes. I know to whom you are referring. I envy her being the object of such love. To the extent... ...that in such times, I think only of her absence. All you need to... Alas, no. Gabrielle de Polignac is not the type... ...to be handled like a pastry. It's what thrilled me when I first saw her. She seemed so at home. She came and went as if she'd always lived there. She was never consumed with the need to please me. That freedom of hers pleases me. You must wonder why she is not by my side when I desire her so much. Me, Queen of France. The answer terrifies me. I am forced to acknowledge that I am her prisoner. Two hours ago I asked Madame Campan to fetch her. Gabrielle let it be known that she was upset. What does she have to be upset about? What did I do to be unpleasant? May I try to attain what Madame Campan couldn't? I'm better placed to find the words necessary. I know these words, Majesty. From the books I read to you. Do try... and we shall see. Let me see the Duchess. On behalf of the Queen. The Duchess is fast asleep. Then I'll wake her. Madame Campan already tried in vain. Let me through. The Duchess took two opium seeds to fall asleep. You want to know what I think? I think the Queen is an evil woman. She made my mistress lose her head. It's the opposite, Madame Tournon. I don't need you. The Queen asked you to fetch her Gabrielle? Not your concern. Go dismantle the Queen's jewels. Her jewels? It's her latest whim. Remove the settings and keep the gems. She says it's easier to pack. So, Mademoiselle? Did you do what I asked? She's sound asleep. Like a baby. What are you talking about? I asked if you worked out the route to Metz. Get my hairdresser Leonard. Geography is not in your domain. L?onard has travelled. Augustine! Go fetch Monsieur L?onard. Come help remove these jewels from their settings. Don't forget my son's sailor suit. And my daughter's straw hat. The sun gives her headaches. I think a pearl fell. I'll look. I'll also need teapots, coffeepots and chocolati?res. And my needles and yarn... ...and a spinning wheel. Madame Campan, write all this down. What do I know of evenings in Metz? I'll be bored stiff. Augustine, help me take these off! She went to get Monsieur L?onard. Mademoiselle Laborde is coming. She's just behind you. I can't find it. Come here! One pearl won't save us! Be so kind as to remove these. Why are you whimpering? Don't be afraid. I'm not abandoning you. I'll be back soon. Is that you squealing? I fell asleep. I couldn't breathe. We're sleeping in a real bed. After his night watch,... ...I can't let his mustache droop. Come on, Gustav. Versailles, July 16th 1789 He was expecting me to shout: "His Excellency, the Duke de Niverney!" - And nothing. - How so? I didn't say or do a thing. Did you chase him away? He had a knife! And Monsieur de Bargue? Still in Madame de Montignac's bed! Poor Madame de Bargue. I really pity her. She was right. Beggars do bring the plague. The Guard deserted. Really? The French Guard deserted? Even the Swiss Guard flew the coop. - The Queen was right to go. - What did you say? She fled to Metz. But it's a secret. That's nonsense. Madame de la Tour de Pin just saw her. She's with the Conseil d'Etat. The King sent for her early. I saw her packing. You must have been dreaming. No more soup! I'm ashamed. I never drink wine. The Marquis de la Chesnaye found me near the King's chambers. Can you imagine the disaster? If the King had seen me... My God, I'm so ashamed. Mr. Moreau, have you news of the Queen? The Queen... Is she conferring with the King? The King... What do you know? At this very moment they're in the Cabinet. I saw Monsieur de Barentin. But who are all these peons? Indeed... ...everything is out of kilter. Butcher! You'll pay! It had to be expected. What did he do? Nothing, but his brother beheaded the commander of the Bastille. With a pocket knife. But he's a decent boy. Louison? It's me, Sidonie. Are you still asleep? The clock! Shit! Marquis, have you seen Monsieur Moreau? Good old Moreau! In the 25 years I've lived here,... ...I've never seen him like that. I knew I'd see you here. Do you have the embroidery? - I'm almost done. - Perfect. Remember to return the finery book. Madame d'Ossun mustn't get in trouble. If the Queen wants to leaf through it. You know her... and her whims. She has more important things on her mind. The King! We must flee, I say. What must I do to convince you, my brother? Stand up. We're being observed. Excuse me, Marquis. There's no use running anyway. According to them, the King is staying in Versailles. Here's the government. Duke de la Vauguyon, Minister of Foreign Affairs Monsieur de la Porte, Minister of the Marine. Monsieur de Barentin, Keeper of the Seals. There is not much to add to your archives. The King will now check the thermometer in the Throne Room. It's a total disaster. After much hesitation, the King has decided to stay. Breteuil's government is dismissed. Will Necker be back? I do not know. It is not entirely certain yet. Gentlemen, we must resign ourselves to a new dynasty. Louis XVI,... ...is no longer free to decide. He is hostage to the insurrection. What will you do? Stay with her, the time it takes. This prospect... ...seems to fulfill you. I can't imagine my disarray, had she left. - And you, Monsieur Moreau? - Me... ...until the day I die,... ...I'll take notes. Here's the situation. The Queen has withdrawn to her apartments. You must entertain her with a book. Which one? She's not with the Duchess? Gabrielle isn't all-powerful. Hurry. She loves "Famous Dogs". Too frivolous. "History of the Sky". Too vast. "The Princess of Cleves." Too sad. Rousseau's "Confessions"? You'll see with her. But remember... ...I'm the one asking you to stand by. In a corner. The antechamber? We're unpacking in there. With Mme de Rochereuil? She was fired. The Queen caught her stealing. Sad losing a close friend. I've never had friends in Versailles. We'll go in back. - I must tell you... - What? - The chiming clock. - Yes? Louison stole it. She left with her Swiss Guard. We'll deduct it from your pay. Are you serious? I'd need several lives. Who cares about the chiming clock? I so wanted to leave. I'd never wanted anything so badly. I've never been so mortified in my life. Had the King agreed, you and I would have been saved. My dear friend... ...I was so worried. I kept thinking you were ill. Such dark thought crossed my mind. But here you are. Glowing. You're so beautiful in this green dress. Sea green? Pale green? Fern green? Jade green? Baby crocodile green? No, my dear. It's as far from baby crocodile green... ...as it is from spinach green or acid green. Silk green? Or envy green? Envy is the most common thing in the world. All they do is covet the spot above their own. Then they bump into the ceiling. I wish I could have you always by my side. I feel so young every time I see you. Did you see those grief-stricken faces? Those musty-smelling ravens. And then I saw you,... ...sparkling in this dress. Light green is the color of hope. So you dressed up for me. Only for you, Madame. You know, dear friend... ...I barely exaggerate the hate that surrounds us. I dragged you into it. Because of me, the people want your head. You know what I learned at the Conseil this morning? Yesterday in Paris... ...a woman was stabbed in her carriage. The murderers mistook her for you. Burning our effigies is no longer enough. They want us... ...in flesh and blood. This is why, dear Gabrielle. I'm beseeching you... ...leave France. You and your family. You're surely right, Madame. I will leave because I must. Say no more. Go away. Wait! Let me inhale one last time the scent of your youth. Don't let me abandon you. You already have. It's done. You've abandoned me. Augustine! The smelling salts! I don't need anything! Or anyone! Leave me alone! Leave me alone. To what do I owe this honor? You never set foot here. If only I knew where to set foot. I'm as lost as you. There's a cobweb in your hair. I went for a walk. In the attic? It's too rainy for a walk on the roof. So here we are. Prisoners, you and I. I just spoke with Monsieur Bailly,... ...who was named mayor of Paris. He was welcomed at the Hotel de Ville very enthusiastically. What did he say? Something very distressing. The people want not only bread, but power. How can anyone want power? I've always considered power a curse one inherits unwillingly. A curse hidden under ermine cloak. What else did he say? I'm to reinstate Necker and announce it myself. At the Hotel de Ville? You know I hate violence. I can't stop half-way. Then we shall go together. It is the King and the King alone who must go to Paris. Don't go... please. A fanatic can assassinate you. It's my duty. What duty do you mean? To be killed? Taken hostage? To abandon your children? - When are you going? - Tomorrow. With soldiers? Bringing my Guard would not please the people. Mar?chal de Beauvau and Admiral d'Estaing will come. Sheer madness. No, the voice of reason. Are you done? Let me see. I haven't slept. - I need a nap. - Use my bed. I'm better off in my room. Like a nun in a cell? Why do you say that? You'll end up a nun. See Paolo again? Wake up! My mistress hanged herself. Where? From a beam in her bedroom. Sidonie, I'm scared! Is she still there? I asked Antonio to untie her. Antonio? Yes. We're getting married. Really? What can I do? I have to go back. But I can't go alone. Monsieur de Coigny? Are you there? I'm sorry to bother you. Don't be, Mademoiselle Laborde. In such circumstances... Has her husband been informed of her death? He left the chateau. He has behaved unspeakably. No use going back, Alice. Sleep here tonight. I can't leave Antonio alone. I'll go. Honorine, go get my boots. We'll wake up Father Heriss?. Now I understand. Understand what, Sidonie? Why the Queen was knocking at doors. You're dreaming... She never opened a door in her life. That man, without a cassock... ...carrying a marble statue... Is that Father Heriss? or am I blind? Your vision is excellent. He wasted no time jumping ship! Don't worry. I'll wake the bishop. What an appalling spectacle. The Marquis de Vaucouleurs! At his age... I'll come along after all. Doggie! I hadn't seen her for a long time. But being of equal rank, I owe her a prayer. In a nightdress? It's indecent... Before being cheated on, she had an unconventional streak. Alice... Let's go. Did you know of Alice's marriage? Of course. It's a good one too. Antonio's cousin is one of the King's valets. I'm told nothing. You tell us nothing. It's true. Where do you come from? You have parents? Are they dead or alive? Where were you born? After four years I know nothing about you. Just mystery. Always reading. There's more to life than books... And the Queen! May she rest in peace. Don't fall, Antonio! Versailles, July 17th 1789 God knows if they'll ever reunite. The finery book and the embroidery. Very good work, Mademoiselle Laborde. Thank you. How is the Queen? Wait for me here. What matters is to make it to Switzerland. How is my outfit, Polignac? Nowadays, coachmen keep their necks longer than noblemen. But I've never driven a carriage. That mobcap suits you. It's giving me some naughty ideas. Save them for inn servants. My wife dislikes masquerades. Why are we waiting? I'm in a hurry. This apron annoys me! You're worried about leaving. No, I'm dying to get out of here. Lovely for Her Majesty, your friend. Remember, we're following her orders. Can you explain? It's the Queen who will. Come. Refuse what she asks you. I cannot refuse her anything. It's not my concern anyway. Come see. Remember? Two days ago I asked to have a dahlia embroidered. What do you think? Madame Bertin's embroiderer is talented. She stitched that with love. What's her name again? Marie-Louise Berchaud. She'll be rewarded. On that table... ...over there... ...there is a speech I wrote by my own hand. Bring me the paper, please. If ever the King is in a worrisome position,... ...I'll give this speech to the Assembly. Start reading. Gentlemen, I give... No, out loud! As if you were Queen of France. "Gentlemen. "I give you the wife... "... and the family of your King. "Do not divide on earth... "... what was united in heaven." I haven't written the rest. Good start though? Very good. You think they'll let him return? With all my heart. What an idiot I am to ask you. You have no idea. No one does. I know he's doing his duty. Quiet! Let's change the subject. Let's discuss your future. It's with you, Madame. No, it's not. A carriage is leaving for Switzerland. You'll be in it. Don't look so glum. Two days ago you said you'd be willing to travel for me. I'm granting you the privilege. You'll escape with the Duke and Duchess de Polignac. Gabrielle is too famous and wrongly disparaged. Undisguised, she'll be killed. She'll go dressed as a servant, and you as her. If ever you're stopped, I want her spared. In a way, Your Majesty,... ...you're asking me to go as bait. An ugly word for a pretty mouth! Words are all I possess. I wield them well. No arrogance when I allow you to earn my love! Send for Madame Bertin. I confided in you yesterday my love for Gabrielle because you deserve it. Was ever a queen on such intimate terms with her reader? Almost nothing to touch up. Undress! Madame Bertin! Gold coins for your embroiderer. Congratulate her on my behalf. It's too much, Your Majesty. Sidonie. Tell Gabrielle... ...that I'll never forget her. Who do you think you are? Mind yourself. Sit back. There's no need to be seen. In Sens we'll see. See what? Your friend had a bad idea. Do you have another? This masquerade will fail. It's up to you to look like a lackey. Do something. Lie down on the seat. Do justice to the Queen's expectations. Where are you going? To Basel. I have family there. You have a safe-conduct? It's you? It's me. I'm with my servant and my valet. Have a safe trip. Let them through. My name is Sidonie Laborde. Both my mother and father are dead. I was the Queen's reader. I obey the Queen. Soon I will be far from Versailles. Soon I will be no one. FAREWELL, MY QUEEN In memory of Jacques Tronel
