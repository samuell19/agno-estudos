- Hey, come here. I got you. The same one? You wanna talk about it? - It just... It felt so vivid. Like I could feel it. I was drowning. And I think someone was trying to help me this time. - Really? Who was it? - I don't know. I couldn't see anything. There was blood everywhere. But I could feel him. - Him? - I don't know. - Babe, we're gonna get through this, all right? - What if we don't? - We don't have any choice. We gotta get through this. - You're such an optimist. - With a dash of love. Of course. Mm. Let's get your meds. - No, I made up my mind. I'm not going to... - Going to what? Take them? - Will you just hear me out? Okay? They... They make me lethargic. Like, sometimes I can't even function or do simple things. - And that's just because you're stressed out, all right? You're working a lot, between the shop, with Jada, with me. And you can't be every woman all the time, babe. - Bryce, I made up my mind. - And that's it? No discussion? No thought on how this ended last time with you going... - Don't. Don't. - No. - Don't go there. - No, we've already moved in now and unpacked our shit. The last tango around you sneaking and not taking your medication resulted in your agoraphobia making you believe you were trapped in your car. You punched out the window. That's how you got the scar on your hand. You ran for blocks on end, Faith, until you collapsed. Is that what you wanna relive, day in and day out? That's the experience we wanna give our daughter? Babe. I'm begging you, please. Take the medication so we can start our day in peace. I love you and you know this. This is what's best. Jada! It's time for school, monster! - Can I join you? Good morning my loves. Good morning, princess. Muah! - Morning, daddy. - Morning, darling. And I believe I already gave you a good morning. - Oh, is that so? - Mm-hm. - Good morning and welcome to New Day World News. Joining me this morning is presidential candidate and retired four-star general, Michelle Dupree. She is best known... - Babe. - Hm? - For leading a successful mission into Afghanistan and the take down of the OCI regime. A terrorist organization... - Babe, did you remember... - Just give me a second. - By overthrowing and killing then President Abdur-Raheem Zalmai. Welcome to New Day, General Dupree, and congratulations on your recent retirement and of course, your bid for the presidency. - Thank you for having me. That was quite an introduction. You know, Lydia, one of the things that I am most proud of was being able to assist the new democratically elected president of Afghanistan with taking power. It's a great addition to my life's work to see the Afghani people receive the liberation and leadership they so rightly deserve. - I was watching that. - Exactly. Meanwhile, your husband and our daughter have been trying to get your attention. Did you remember to make arrangements for Jada? You know she has a half day at school today. - Oh my god, Bryce, I forgot. Can you please call in? - No, we talked about this. I told you, I have patients all day today. Which is why you agreed this morning that you would figure it out. - I know, I meant to. And I just got distracted. You know that general on TV? She looks, like, really familiar to me. - That's because she's always on TV. And you're a news hound and that's that. - Right. So a half a day, huh, Jada? Look, mommy has to work late, okay? Because there's inventory coming into the store and I gotta close. Karena asked for the evening off. - Karena? - Mm-hm. - Who's that? - Yeah, she's my new employee. She's so good. - What happened to Melissa? - Ugh, she was terrible. Had no customer service experience. I mean, she just felt like she was too good to touch people's feet. So I was like, listen girl, go be a rocket scientist or something. Since you wanna act like you're just too good to do anything. - I thought we agreed to select new employees together. - We did. But I needed someone right away. Karena it is. It's not a big deal. Look, how about I text Miss Amy about picking you up for us? - Miss Amy to the rescue! And I'll get to play with her puppies. - Mm-hm. Done. - Jada gets what she wants. All the time. - Eat all your carrots today. Promise? Good. - That's my baby. - Whew. - Yeah, I need these. I'm coming back for you. Faith. Guess who has a date? Okay, I'm just gonna tell you. You're taking too long. My grandma. - What? - You heard me. Granny said she met a man online. She liked him and they went on a few dates. So she gonna live her best life. So, she can't babysit my son tomorrow. - Okay, so Mr. Steal-Your-Grandmother is in full effect? - Pretty much, yeah. - All right, well, that's okay because I have a sitter for Jada tonight and I did plan on closing. And I'll just figure some things out for tomorrow. - Okay, oof! I'm getting out of here. Thank you, Faith, girl. - Mm-hm! - Best boss ever. - Mm-hm! - Oh shit. Um, and can you clock me out? Okay. Oh, I'm so sorry. I did not even see you. - It's fine. I was actually just going to ask for directions. My phone died and this was my navigation. - Happens to me all the time. Look, all you do is exit the parking lot, make a left, and you'll see the signs, okay? - Thank you. - You're welcome, bye. - I'll just get right to it. Dupree can't be trusted. - You're just figuring that out? Listen, I know she was your father's right hand. He prided himself on maintaining these powerful connections and he worked hard to construct this impressive empire of Afghan heroin but that Dupree... - Yeah, but since his death, Dupree's changed. - Yeah. - She's quieter. Gained a lot more power in a short amount of time. - Mm. - It's part of the reason I relocated. You know, the main office from New York to LA. Dupree's here. And I've got a feeling she's setting something up to take us out, undercut us. You don't think she's running for president for the betterment of the people do you? - Oh! - Bravo, General, Bravo. - Mr. Secretary. - You told me every one of those soldiers in that unit was dead. Thomas Richardson, suicide, shot himself in the head. Carol Davinson, alcohol poisoning, drank herself to death. Marilyn Roman, electrocuted in a freak accident. And Imani Avant drowned. Allegedly. - This is impossible. Uh. - Now fix it. - I need a moment. - You got it, boss. - Dominique. I need to see you. Come here, baby. - You called for me? - Mm, oh, I did. - I'm here. - I missed you. - Missed you, too. - So I just got a call. - Okay. Ah. - And it contradicts every fucking thing you told me about Imani's death, bitch. Is she alive? - I promise. I swear she's dead. I swear. You asked me to protect the family and I did. At all costs. Imani betrayed all of us, remember? Remember? Remember that? She had to pay. This has to be a mistake. - For your sake, I hope it is, bitch. Now get the fuck off me! Get your shit and get out. - Hello. - Scarlet never lost her letter. - Really? - Absolutely. - So, no wet bird? - I have no fucking idea. But I need you to go look. - Where? - I'll text you the rest. - Don't move. - Wait, wait. Wait, you can have whatever you want. - Get down! - You can have whatever you want! I promise you, I don't, ah! - Stay down! I told you not to move. - Keep 'em up, keep 'em up. - Clear. - Is that crystal clear? - Near the front door. Near the front door. - Stay right there. - I should have both of your fucking heads right here, right now. - You look like you could use a meal. You want some? - Your father gave you one fucking job. One. To be a good son. But you couldn't even handle that. I mean my god, Raymond handed you everything. Money, his multi-million dollar liquor distribution business, his connections, Afghanistan. Me. But no matter how much he loved you and took care of you, and even though you were his junior, there's still one thing he couldn't teach you. Loyalty. Your sister was not only a better soldier than you, she was more of a man than you'll ever be. So maybe she should have been left alive. She is dead, right? Well, you know what they say. You want something done right, do it yourself. - Well, I guess she's dead then. - You can play this game. But you and I both know who loses in the end. You'll go down. And so will your family's entire legacy. - Hm. You know, my father always said, "Those on the proximity to power" "are sometimes deluded into thinking they wield it." "But in fact, it's the man standing behind you" "that decides if you take that next step or not." - Are those his final words? You were the last one to see your father alive, right? Strange how he died so suddenly like that. With only you there. - Ha, ha. Next time have some class and order the steak medium rare. And don't fuck up my fundraiser! - What the hell is this? Looks like a robbery gone wrong. - Gone wrong is right. This is professional. - A gang hit? - From the looks of this, more than that. All these bodies are armed. All I know is that whatever it is, it's ruining my weekend plans. Any witnesses? - Just one, sir. - Sir. I've been here for hours. An officer still has not come and taken my report. Now I know I don't have to wait this long to make a report for my wife missing. - Well, is she missing voluntarily or involuntarily? I mean, I see husbands everyday. And don't even get me started on the wives looking for their husbands. - My wife is missing! Okay, she could be in danger. She doesn't have her medication. Anything could have happened. She owns a shoe store, she shut down, did not come home. - Which shoe store, sir? - The Gleaming Slipper. On the strip mall right off the freeway. - Wait right here. Hey. Call Hoffman. I think this might have something to do with those murders. - Murders? - Mr. Dames. Mr. Avant is in a meeting right now. Please, have a seat. I said, he's in a meeting. You can't go in there, stop! Mr. Avant, I explained to Mr. Dames that you were in a meeting and he insisted. - It's fine, Nola. - Are you sure? Because I can call security. - I am security. Good day, Nola. - I promise you, Nola, it's fine. Good day, Mr. Dames. Take a seat. - What type of fucking mission are you sending me on? Are you playing with me or something? - What? I've been waiting on word from you since last night and nothing. So you tell me. What mission you been on? - Anytime you've given me a job, I do it. I've never given you any reason to check up on me, or clean up after me. And I never needed back up. - That's why I hired you. - Yeah, I go to carry out the job you hired me to do. And you send a god damn A-team to the scene before me? - What? What the fuck is he talking about? - Unless it was you? - Ha, ha! You're out of your mind. Supreme, get your boy, man. - See, maybe you nervous, scared, that I'm getting too close. Close enough to take your place and push you out the way. So you send me into an ambush. - Two things, boy. One, you could never take my fucking place. And I don't send mother fuckers to kill, they send me. So calm your ass down and leave me out of whatever bullshit you really got going on. - Fellas, this is real cute. I hate to break this up. But somebody better tell me what's going on now. Talk! Where's she at? - She got away. - Fuck. - And it definitely was her. - So what now? - What you mean, what now? I'll find her, I'll execute her, period. - Yeah, that's exactly what we'll do. But first we're gonna let her come to us. If there's one thing I know about Dorothy, that bitch will always find her way home. - It's only me and you, Imani. - Ah! Oh shit. - Mr. Newford. I'm detective Hoffman. We'd like to show you some footage. - Footage of what? - An incident that occurred last night. Maybe it'll shine some light on where your wife is. Is that your wife? - That's not the wife I know. - Can I help you? - Who are you and why are you in my house? - Excuse me? - Where's Bryce and Jada? - Ma'am, ma'am. You probably got the wrong address. - Are you fucking crazy? - Ma'am are you okay? - I live here, where the fuck is my family? - Ma'am, hey, hey, hey. Are you all right? - Honey, is everything okay? I heard yelling. - No, baby, it's all right. I'm gonna handle this. - And she's in my fucking robe. What the fuck is... - Hey! - Where the fuck is my family? - Ah! - I'm not gonna ask you again. - I'm on with the police. - Call them. This is my fucking house, they'll figure this shit out. - Hurry, please, she's attacking us now. - Bryce. - Daddy, daddy! Where's Mommy? - Hey, baby. Uh, Mommy's gonna be home soon, okay? I promise that. But guess what? - What? - So you know, you love the lake house. - Yes. - Amy's gonna take you to the lake house and Mommy and I will join you soon, all right? - Yay, the lake! - We're gonna have so much fun. Let's go pack, okay? - Okay! - What the fuck? - You should not be on this phone. - Senator. - I'm not pleased. Matter of fact, that's an understatement. I'm vexed. I'm quite vexed. I need to understand how a veteran CIA officer allows any of this to happen. Please, fill me in. Because the last come to Jesus moment that we had, you told me you were weening her off the medication and slowly bringing her around. - Yes, I was bringing her around but... - Shh. I was raised to believe that anything before that "but" is bullshit. So why don't you do us both a favor and skip to the part where somehow, once again, you led me into a mess that I have to clean up for you and your assigned bride. - If you'll let me explain, Senator. - You see, that's my issue, Alexander. You're always explaining. First, you explained that in order for Avant to feel that she was in a normal family, she needed a child. So we arranged for you to adopt one. Then you explained that she was bored being a housewife so we put things in place for her to open a fucking business. All under the guise that you would be bringing her around just in time for me to use the information that I need. And yet all I've gotten out of it is Dupree's poll numbers rising and her climbing directly up my ass in the presidential race. - My wife, I mean... - No, you're right. You were correct. Your wife. Because clearly, you've fallen in love. - With all due respect, Senator, let's be real here for a moment. You knew Avant and I had a thing going on before any of this. Which is why you and the head of your company elected that I'd be on top of this assignment. And the fact that she's been shot and has amnesia, that's real. We've just been prolonging it so that we can wait it out until the election year. And that was your call. - It was. Why? Because if she stepped into total recall she would confront Dupree and Dupree would try to kill her. Again. And probably get away with everything. - And that wouldn't have been good for you running for president. - Exactly. - But I've done everything so far that you've asked me to do. - Everything except keeping bandits from kidnapping your asset outside a store. Other than that, you're doing great. Now, this election's gonna be here before you know it. And you shoulda brought her around by now, Doctor. Especially if you expect me to nominate you as the head of the Central Intelligence Agency. Unless that's changed? - Nothing's changed, sir. At the same time, we both know the process of removing this medication can cause severe hallucinations and even be deadly. Which is why the weening takes time. - You know what takes time? You dragging this out takes time. You should have let her just have some seizures or whatever the fuck it is and get on with it. Yet here we are with soldier gone wild on the loose. Two dead hit men in the parking lot and god only knows who sent them. And police evidence that your wife killed them. Evidence that we now have to make disappear. - I've handled that. - Oh yeah. Yeah, let's not forget about the police report you filed. - Of course, I've gotta play the concerned husband. - Okay, let's cut the bullshit. You're not fooling any fucking body with that. You were concerned. About your wife. Now. You have 72 hours to get her ass back in place and resume your assignment. Or I'm gonna eliminate the whole operation. And I do mean the whole operation. - Going up. - If I don't leave, he's going to kill me. And you too. - What happened? - Listen, I have to tell you something. - Anything. - Supreme was apart of the original hit on Imani. He got the orders from the General but... - But what? - I did it. I was desperate for money, for my mother's medical expenses and... I just agreed. And I swear I thought Imani was dead. - Why did they want her dead? - Something about, she knew too much and that she was gonna be bringing everyone down with the information she had. Something went down in Afghanistan. And the General returned on operation wipe out. The entire troops were knocked off. - You? - Hell no! One body of blood on my hands was more than enough for me. - What's General Dupree's real ties to Supreme? - She was his father's overseas connect, then his. Now he and Jonathan are going a different direction with another connect. - Who? - I don't know. - I need you to find that out. - Why? We need to get out of here like we said. I have access to Supreme's accounts and I've transferred more than enough money into mine. He won't miss it. I've packed my bags and as soon as I leave here, I'm gone. And I want you to come with me. But if you decide that you wanna stay and remain loyal to him, I promise you, he's gonna take you down too. Especially since he sent you to bring her back and you haven't. - Shh, shh, shh. Shh. Let me worry about that. - Officer, I'm gonna need you to uncuff this patient. - I have orders to keep her restrained at all times. - Orders and this patient's health are not of the same importance. Okay, she needs a CT scan of her head. Anyhow, when I return I'd appreciate my patient being out of these cuffs. - Faith Newford's room. - Uh, 450. - Okay. All right, anyone in the room, get them out, immediately. Standby until I get there. I need to handle this. If she escapes, bring her back to me. Alive. - Don't do anything stupid, okay? - Oh, fuck! - What the fuck is going on here, Newford? You can't just run up in here and bark orders. Your wife is needed for questioning and you know why. - Ah, god. - Now call off your fucking dogs and get your ass out of my investigation. Or this won't end well. - Hey, Cap. I have a detective... Hoffman here. He doesn't seem to understand his position, Captain. Thank you, sir. He's clear for sure. - Shit head. Captain. Yeah, but... Okay. Fuck! - Ah! Oh. Hey! - Faith. Wait. - God damn it. - Bryce? - Target secure. Faith, baby. I know you're scared. But I need you to trust me. I need you to come with me. I can explain! - And then she gonna say, you must be taking diet baby aspirin. Because them blue pills you takin, ain't doing shit for you. I mean, she clean cussed me out. Said she's looking to settle down with a stallion. Ha! I told her, bitch, you are 72 years old. The only stallion you'll be settling down with is Jesus Christ. Yeah, sure did! Yeah, all right, Momma. I love you too. All right. - Alrighty, here we go! All right. Alrighty, Ralph. Are you ready for your last ride? All right, here we go. Vroom, vroom, vroom! Ah! Watch out, going through the door! Ah. Ah. Here we go. Look out. Here we go. Ah. - Hold it. - Oh, shit. They got me. Listen, listen. I can explain. Now, I've been meaning to file my taxes since '96. But after what I seen y'all do to Ron Isley... - Sir, please step away from the vehicle. - No, I, I can't do that, now. You see, I know exactly what this is about. - Sir, I need you to move away from the vehicle. Now. Thank you. - Shit. For 32 years I done bagged and zipped and bagged and zipped and bagged some more. And nobody ever come behind me to check my work. It's that new supervisor of mine. I know she sent you. I'm filing a grievance. Today. And poor Ralph. All he did was drop dead on Wednesday. And he can't even rest in peace without the po-po running up on him. Shoot. - Sorry about the inconvenience, sir. Have a good day. Sir, sorry. - What... you? It's a damn shame. God damn shame. God damn shit. I tell ya, Ralph. A black man can't catch a break. - Get out. - I knew that bag was a little too bulky for Ralph. Look, don't shoot now. Because you won't get no argument and no ID from me. - I don't wanna hurt you. - That makes two of us. - I'll be needing this hearse. - Lady, you can have this hearse. You can have the keys, Ralph's old stinkin' ass. All of it. You ain't getting no argument from me, lady. I ain't seen nothing. Ha. - Step away slow. - Okay. All right, take it easy. - Faith! Oh my god, are you okay? - I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I'm trying everything. I'm... I'm lost. My world is falling apart and I don't know who I am. I don't know what to do. - Is it Bryce? Is it Jada? Why are you in a hospital gown and a robe? - I don't know. I don't know how I got here. I don't... - It's okay, it's okay. Shh. It's okay. Let's get you changed and showered and something to eat, okay? Then we'll talk. Tell me what's going on. Were you in the hospital? And why do you have a gun? - Girl, I feel like I'm losing my mind. My entire life as I know it has been erased. I go home and there's random people in my home. And my baby is gone. And then I'm at the hospital and Bryce shows up and he's a completely different person. He pulled a gun on me. - What? What do you mean? - I've been kidnapped. - What? By who? - I've been shot at. - With bullets? - I've been called Imani Avant. - Who? Who is that? - I don't know. I don't know, but whoever she is, somebody wants the bitch dead. - Um... What floor of the hospital did you say you were on again? The locked one? - I'm not crazy. - I... I didn't say that. It's just... What did you say your husband did again? What kind of friends do y'all have? - He's a doctor. We don't have friends. We have a nanny. And there's you. Look. A couple of years ago I was in a really serious car accident. I got amnesia from it. Bryce has been really good about filling me in on the details of my life. - Girl. Look, I'm not a cop or nothing but I do watch "Investigation ID." And this sounds like one of those stories called A Whole Damn Problem. And on the last episode, this man stole his wife's identity and gave it to the mistress. - Karena. - Babe. - Karena. This is not that. - Then why would somebody call you by another name? - I don't know. - Well, let's Google that name and see. Imani Avant. War hero and heiress to the Avant Liquor Distribution Company dynasty. Dead after accidentally drowning. Faith. Is this you? - Will you click on that? - Captain Imani Avant has been laid to rest today. The war hero and daughter of well revered business man Raymond Avant Senior drown tragically after returning from a successful tour in Afghanistan. Captain Avant is survived by her brother Raymond Jr. As you can see, the well loved army soldier was so highly regarded that four-star general Michelle Dupree and Secretary of Defense, Arthur Bridges were in attendance at her service. - Okay, click on her. Zoom in. - Yeah. I'm so glad you came up here with me. I so needed a moment away from the city. And plus I've been wanting to get here for awhile. - Yeah. Honestly, this place is beautiful. You know my brother really loves you. I haven't seen him this happy since our mother died. - I love him too. And I would do anything for him. - Ha! Sorry. This wine is really strong. The wine is strong. Yeah, I thought the wine overseas was strong, ha! This... - Cheers. - Wait. - Um... Are you sure you're okay? - What's the date on that article? - Uh, the funeral was only a year ago. - Bryce said we've been married 10 years. That can't be me. Pull up that picture again. Fuck. - Yeah. And that guy, Raymond Jr. Better known as Supreme. The one that they're saying is your... I mean, her brother. He owns the Avant Suite downtown. It's one of those high end exclusive clubs for the rich and famous. Politicians, A-listers, that's who goes there. You know, I've heard a lot of things about that Avant family. Like, powerful. And dangerous things. - Dangerous like what? Karena, run! - Girl. - Girl, run! - Okay, all right. Ah! - God damn it! - Hey! - Ah! - Fuck! - Faith! Get in! Get in, girl. Come on. Girl, close the door, close the door, close the door. People are really coming after you, faith. Why? Has this got something to do with your family? - I don't know, Karena. - Some mafia type shit? - I don't know! But I need to find out. - Right, because you like some wingnut terminator type bitch. I mean, you fucked a handful of men up with one karate kick. How you do that? - Good question. I need to talk to Bryce. - Yeah, call him. Right now. - Hello? Hey, baby, is that you? Where are you? Come home, please. You need your medication. - Bryce. - Faith. - We need to talk. - What'd he say? - He knows something. Take me home. - I don't know, Faith. Are you sure? - Whatever is going on, I can't just leave Jada here. We'll figure some shit out. - Well, then I'm coming with you. - What I need you to do is just get your son and your grandmother and go somewhere safe. - I will. - Let me know if you can get anymore information. - What the fuck is going on? - Faith. - Why did you have a gun at the hospital? - A gun? I was there to bring you home. - Don't lie to me. - Faith, babe. Give me the gun. All of this is happening because you're off your medications. I told you this would happen. All right, the panic attacks. The violence. Feeling trapped. I love you, so much. Okay? And I promise we're gonna get past this but... You've gotta trust me. I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Come on, let's go to bed. Come on. Come on. Come on babe, let's go. - I'm disappointed in you, bitch. I'm so disappointed in you. Uh-huh. Stealing? Sending a woman to do a man's job, I can deal with that. That's my fault. But ain't no bitch gonna steal from me. - Okay. - I'm sorry. I've never been like this. - You only live once. - Same one? - No. This time someone shot me. - Really? You wanna talk about it? - No. I just want to get my day started. - Babe, listen. I know you don't like taking them pills, but... We'll get through this. - I know. - Now who's the optimist? - With a dash of love. Jada, monster! It's time to get up. May I join you? I'll take that as a yes. - Mm. She's back at home now. Everything's back to normal. I've got eyes on her everywhere this time. In a few days I'll lower the dosage on her medication. We should be able to find the documents then. - Well done. Now. Who sent those men? - General Dupree. But Dupree's men weren't the only ones to show up. The brother's men. - Hm. - Raymond Supreme Avant Jr. Daddy's little prince. Handed life on a palladium spoon. My sources tell me it was Dupree who ordered the brother to execute his sister. And that's how she got the bullet in the back of the head. - Wow. It appears as though it's time to return the favor. - Absolutely. - And yet somehow you're still sitting here with me. - Good morning, gentlemen. I appreciate you stopping in. I'm still a little bit upset about my sweet Dominique so forgive me if I'm not myself, all right? - Well, I still can't believe it. - Me either. I know you loved her, she was good to you. - Too good. - I don't want you to worry about it, okay? I've already put some men on it and we'll figure out who did this. - Yeah, well my money's on Dupree. That's okay. No worries. Karma is the master mother fucker, trust. Ha. Speaking of Dupree. Those men who snatched Imani before you got there, Khalil. - Yeah? - Those were the General's men. - Are you sure General Dupree did that? - Yeah, that bitch. She was actually the one who gave me the intel I gave you, but obviously she ain't trust me enough to take care of it. - She could have got me killed. - Right. That's all right, I got something for her ass. - And what is that? - A mark in the cemetery and a slow walk to hell. I just gotta get her there. - Well, she does have the fundraiser at the club coming up. - Indeed. - Oh shit. Faith? Well, isn't this a pleasant surprise. - Is it? Did you forget it's our anniversary? Mm. Now who's forgetting? - Does it matter now? - Slow down, baby. Let me do the rest. - Faith. - Shh. Don't say another fucking word. Xavier Alexander. I wanna know what's going on. Don't lie to me. Don't try to gaslight me. Because I love you. But I will fucking kill you. I want to know every single detail. - Okay. Listen. When you got home from Afghanistan, you went to the head of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. With the promise of returning with documents and proof. - Well, keep up the good work, Captain. - Thank you, sir. - Absolutely. - Suddenly soldiers in your unit were showing up dead. I was put on the case. Powell wanted proof of what went on in Afghanistan. I had been assigned to follow you. That night at the lake, you were there with your brother's girlfriend. I had to fall back a few places or blow my cover. And I lost you for a moment. When I found you, you were drowning. I pulled you out. I thought I had lost you forever. Everything that happened after that was to keep you alive. You actually had amnesia. But when you started to heal and your memories were flooding back, we were in a full operation. And I was scared you would go full metal jacket to bring down General Dupree too soon. So I had to create us a life. One you would believe. Suppress your memories with medication and keep you safe until the right time. - How do I look? - You look great. A lot better. I mean, what did you want me to do? I couldn't just let them kill you. - You killed me. Because what the fuck is a Faith Newford? I am Imani Avant. What the fuck is that besides murder? And then your dumb ass couldn't even be creative. You named me the same god damn thing. Did you not know that Faith and Imani mean the same thing? - Of course. It's symbolic. That's why I picked it. Imani. You are back now. And you know what that means. - You make the call? - Did exactly as you instructed. As soon as she hits her mark, it'll be in place. - Taking out a presidential candidate. You're a bold mother fucker. - I was raised that way. - Excuse me, fellas. - Got it. Everything's a go. - Catch her ass right there. - Everything okay, Khalil? - Mm-hm. - You all right, Jabril? - Yes sir, I think we're being followed. Coming up on the left. - Oh, I think we're okay. Think you're just being a little paranoid. - Yeah, I think we're clear. - You may be right. - Yeah, I'll tell you what, though. These poll numbers are going up. I like to see that. - Yes, sir. - Okay, now what the hell is this now? - Just construction, sir. We're just gonna take this detour. It's probably gonna make us late, though. - Ah, it's probably better, anyway. Let her get there first. I'm gonna steal some of her thunder when I get there. - Ha! - Yo, what the fuck? Jabril, what the fuck are you doing, man? - Yo, somebody's following us! - Well, go! Go, go, go! - Just hang on, I got this. Oh shit. - Who the fuck is this, Jabril, who is this? - I don't know! - Shit, he's getting close, man. Come on, come on. You gotta step on it! - Shit, here we go. - Right. Right, right, right, right! Go around. Who the fuck is this? Go in the tunnel. Go in the tunnel, go! Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel! - Ah. Just hang on, I got this. - This is fucking Dupree. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What the fuck? Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back! Ah! Yo. - Stay in the car, we got this. - Wait, wait, wait. - Yo, let's go. Stay here, we got this. - Don't move! - No, wait. No, no, wait, wait, wait! Hold it. - Stay in the car! - Come on, come on. Put the gun down. What are you gonna do, shoot a senator? Doubtful. Just take me to whoever fucking sent you. - We're honored to host you, Madam General. - It is an honor to be here, Jonathan. - General Dupree, General Dupree! - Thank you, thank you all for coming. Remember, spread the word. Vote. - Madam General. - Thank you, Jonathan. - You're welcome. - General Dupree! One more photo! - There he is. Ha, ha, ha! - Congratulations. - Thank you, it is so good to see you. How have you been? - I've been great. I've been great. - Yes, I hear you've been traveling. - Yes, but you know, I wouldn't miss this for the world. I have to come out and support anything and everything you do. - Thank you, thank you. It means the world to me, you know that. - Yes, yes. I believe you're gonna win. - I do too. - You're gonna take it all the way. - Thank you. Hello, everyone. - Congratulations. - Thank you, what a beautiful table. - Anything you need, we're here. - Thank you, that's so good to know. - No place like home, huh, sis? You look good. For somebody who's seen the light twice, how was it? - You tried to kill me. - No. I sent somebody else to do it. And because I thought you'd be dead and stay there, I didn't think you'd get mad about it. - How could you? Put a hit out on your own sister? - Please. Come on, now. We have never celebrated or been attached to that. That sibling thing. You know? We just arrived here at the same fucked up time by way of the same fucked up people. You know it and I know it. So spare me. - Mm. You really are the devil himself. Did you kill Daddy? He had cancer but it wasn't terminal. - You were off to the Army. Trying to save the world. You don't know that. - I know when I came back our dad's body was reduced to a bag of ashes. - That's because our father didn't want people looking down on him in a casket. So me, being the oldest, and the only one who was here with him, I followed instructions. - You didn't follow shit. You never followed anything. You expect me to believe that. You hated him. - Ah, don't deflect. I hated you. - Oh, because you were jealous of me? Right? Because I was more like Daddy than you would ever be? You know what Daddy and I had in common? Honor. Loyalty. Respect. You're just a narcissist who wanted everything. And no matter what Daddy did, it was never good enough for you. And you know why that is? Because you're just some little weak ass boy still. And we both know that. - Cute. He ain't never give me shit. It was you. You were his prized possession. - Is that why you put a bullet in his head? - Maybe. - Maybe. I might put a bullet in yours. - Ha. Go for it. - Fucking bitch! - Yeah, huh? Where your fucking daddy at now, mother fucker? You ain't got the fucking heart. - And I believe your father's in the military, yes? - Yes, yes. A two-star general. - Meh, I got a couple stars on him, but I won't hold that against him. - Get her out of here! Get her out of here! - Let's go, move, move. - Move. - Well, well, well. I must admit, it's good to see you. You always were a persistent little thing. Surely, you didn't come to kill me. Did you, soldier? Always was your biggest downfall. Trying to outshine the master. Didn't Raymond teach you anything? - This isn't about my father. This is about me and you. - Salam Alaikum. - Alaikum salam. - Balcony, do you see him? - I see him. - Hey Cap, we got a lot of movement up there. We need to move, now. - We're on the move. - I got a phone, 12 o'clock. I don't like this. - We need to get the President out now. - I think we should... - We gotta move! Move! - Cap, wait. Maybe you should... - I shouldn't what? I shouldn't say anything to the General about how she sent us on a fucking suicide mission, huh? Move, soldier. - Mission accomplished? - What mission, General Dupree? The real one or the fake one? That was a drone hit. Not suicide bombers, not rebels. - Be easy, soldier. - I lost three men out there. - Stand down, soldier, last warning. - That was a fucking ambush! - Everything went as planned. - Not the plan relayed to me. We were supposed to save President Zalmai, not kill him. And then blame it on some makeshift, OCI rebels who were armed with American weapons and ammunition and then conveniently named terrorists by you. - Now you're in violation. I said, stand the fuck down! - Oh yeah, well tell it to fucking Congress. Because I already alerted the head of Foreign Affairs Committee, Senator Powell, that this mission was faulty by design. - We have a problem. You know, you always were too self righteous for your own good. Nobody gives a fuck about those people. The world has painted them as terrorists and just maybe that's what they are. Do you think anyone cared that we were the ones who actually ordered the hit on their president? That would be a hell no. And you know why? Because the world has relegated them to being throw away people. Not even worthy of the land and the rich resources they sit upon. Every time somebody fills their gas tank or heats their house or buys oil, do you think they give a damn that we were the ones who ran over villages and started wars and created faux rescue missions to get it? Again, that would be a no. And that is because those people don't matter, Imani. And for the life of me, I can't understand why the fuck you think they do. - They're people. They deserve to live. And live well. Liberation and democracy. That was your mantra. Or... Does that not matter to you when it comes to black and brown babies? - Oh god, here we go. The race card. I don't make up the rules, princess, I just enforce them. And you. You've gotta be the biggest hypocrite of them all. I know you don't think the Avant's wealth just came from your daddy's good looks. How many women and children died? How many rebels were paid to guard your daddy's coca and poppy plantations, huh? How many villages pillaged so you could be amongst the 1%? Going to your fancy schools. Living in your mansions. - Don't try to blame this on my father because we both know you were his partner in all of this. - Yes! Yes, I was! And you wanna know why? Because we understood each other. We understood the assignment. But you, little miss ungrateful. So determined to destroy everything we built and take your own family down in the process. And for what? The good of man? Oh please, that is such a pile of bullshit. - You should rot in hell. - And you should watch your fucking back. Because your borrowed time is ticking. Now move, soldier. - Freeze! - Mother fucker. - I'm okay. I promise. - Commander. - Sergeant Myles Brailey. - Look at you. Okay, this is different. - You like it? - So is this your new uniform? - I guess so. Ha, good to see you. - Good to see you, too. Looks like it's time to get that tatted back on, hm? - Sergeant Brailey. Or should I say, Khalil Dames? My brother, thank you. We couldn't have got this done without you. And now that you're back, we need to figure out where these documents are. - Well, it looks like you don't have to search very far. The documents are in the pendant. - The whole time? - The whole time. - The documents are in the pendant. - It's in the pendant. - You know what we went through? - We could have died. - Dupree, Dupree, Dupree. I usually don't come to such events. But for you, I decided to make an exception. I had such high hopes for us. You were so smart. And you were definitely on your way to being president. But you allowed your own ambitions to get ahead of what I instructed you to do. And now, you know how this works. Don't worry, I made all the proper arrangements. And this will be easy and quiet. Cyanide gas. It'll be quick. Painful, but quick. You'll feel dizzy, the room will spin. You'll begin to seize. Your heart will race. Your blood pressure will spike. And then it'll all be over. Clean this up. - Officers Avant, Brailey, Alexander. Job well done. This is what happens when agencies work together. The CIA and Army spec ops, we're all brothers and sisters when we're out there. Congratulations. Let's not forget your field team. They worked fast and diligently when things started to go south. Thank you for your service. By now you've all heard that General Dupree has committed suicide. Not surprising, she took the coward's way out. And while she'll never face a court of law or jury of her peers, I've received classified intel that she orchestrated the killing of President Zalmai to extend the war in Afghanistan. - Why? - She was involved in a operation that was allowing tons of heroin into our country via our nation's ports. And she was colluding with the rebels of South and West Africa to build a drug empire. When our new president is elected, I'll work with that administration to have the op declassified. So Dupree will be disgraced and go down in history as a war criminal, a drug dealer, and a traitor to the United States. And all of you will be recognized for the heroes that you are. Carry on. - What was that look about? - How would Bridges know about the pipeline? - The pendant. - I haven't given it to anyone yet. - Confirming. Delta-three-nine-nine charlie-six. - Confirmed. - New assignment ready. - Go. - Well, this is interesting. I never thought we'd be here, you and me. - Neither did I. - Did you hear about Dupree? She didn't do so well. - That's typical. Doesn't surprise me, though. She got ahead of herself. - So tell me, how do you plan on getting out of this? - Let's just say, I have a little faith. - Well, she better hurry.
