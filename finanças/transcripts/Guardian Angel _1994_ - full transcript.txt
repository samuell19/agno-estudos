You know, when I first met Nick Taylor, I thought, now there's a man who is going to make some woman very, very happy. Well, you're right on that one. So, when is the wedding? December 19th. You know, I never thought I'd marry a cop. Okay, time to go to work. * music [sigh] And I thought it was only gonna be a couple of kids passing phony 20 dollar bills. We'll see. * music Jimmy, long time no see. * music Jimmy, long time no see. Where's Jake? Jake's taking care of business, and he sent me. [laughter] What, do you got him running the press.

Look, I don't have time for this bullshit. Pay me and it's yours. Yeah well, that's what I wanted to talk to Jake about. There's nothing to talk about. It's 25 cents on the dollar, take it or leave it. What the hell do you care? Have Jake run the printer an extra five minutes and we're all happy. No exceptions. Look. Mr. Batania has been doing business with your people for a long time, loyal business, and you've never given him one friendly discount! Two things!

Thank you. [car door closing] * music [car door opening] [car door closing] Good evening ladies. May I check your purses please? Is that necessary? House rules. What do we have here? Personal protection. It stays at the door. Do I need to ask to see your purse? [zipper opening] Why don't you hold on to this for me? Gladly. Now, have either one of you been to one of Mr. Batania's parties before? No. This is our first time. Okay.s our first time. Mind your p's and q's. Be very nice to the gentleman, and you'll do just fine, okay? Enjoy the party. * music New girls? Yes sir and they were [indistinct] Really? Intriguing. * music [people chatting] Good evening. My name is Charles. Charles Batania. Welcome to my humble abode. Hi. I'm Candy. How sweet. I haven't seen your face before. To my great misfortune. It's quite a party you have going on here. Oh, I throw a bash once a month for my closest business associates. What line of business are you in? This and that. As I was saying, my associates like to indulge in the finest of pleasures. Is that why we're here? I like to think of it as a cooperative effort. Ladies are invited to indulge themselves in the vice of their choices. In the process, they make my customers, my associates more comfortable. Well, your associates seemed quite satisfied. How about you Mr. Batania? Call me Charles. Will you come this way please? * music So, tell me -- Charles, where are your manners? I left them at the door. But you were such a gentleman before. You talk too much. Why don't you show me what else you can do. For measly 5,000 dollars? Measly? My, what a confident lady. Come here, here. [drawer opening] Indulge yourself. [papers crinkling] What are you looking at? You never seen a hundred dollar bill before? Who invited you anyway? A good friend of yours, Lenny G. You're under arrest. Stupid! Stupid woman. Go ahead. Shoot. The gun is empty. Go on shoot! [guns clicking] She is a cop! [fighting] [groans] Has anybody seen Melinda? Let's get out of here. [gun fire] Stop them! They're cops! [fighting] [fighting] [loud bang] [gunshot] You're finished, you piece of shit! You just killed a cop. I'm gonna smash that counterfeiting ring of yours. It's not my ring. I don't deal it. I just buy it. Who deals it? Answer me before I blow your fucking head off. His name is David. It's his operation. It's not my ring. Keep talking. It's 240 McCaan, the old warehouse district. But I can't promise you that anybody will still be alive when you get there! [police siren] * music [sigh] * music [sigh] Money, money, everywhere. Nina, what do say we scrape off a few bills off the top, catch us a flight to Rosarita Beach. Lose ourselves in a bottle of Cuervo Gold, and if you're good, I'll let you swallow the worm. In France, we have a term for men like you, Jack. Yeah, what do you call that? American. * music She is worse than my old lady. [laughter] Yeah, but I bet she's worth it. Right, Sims? * music David, your new plates * music David, your new plates have tripled our business in the last month. That's because they're perfect. They're art, purer. I expect a larger cut, much larger. Of course you do, you're my right hand, you're my partner. I'll take care of you. I don't need any one to take care of me. I want what's coming to me. Nina, without me you would still be whoring for a living. I was doing fine before I met you and I was never a whore. You bounce from millionaire to millionaire like a ping pong ball. That's a whore in my book. But it doesn't matter. That's the past and I took you away from it. So, don't tell me what I owe you! Understand? [cart pushing] Okay, let's get these out in the truck. [door crashing] [gun firing] [groans] [gun firing] [groans] [gun firing] [groans] [gun firing] [police siren] [rustle] Oh man, this is too much to carry. Hey man, some of it's only printed on one side, * music [car door closing] * music [car door closing] [car engine starting] What the! No, come on! [police siren] [tires screeching] Narrator: Attention all units, be advised, we have a stolen squad car heading east on [indistinct] Attention two [indistinct] that's the two assholes up in front of us. Oh, we're screwed man, we're dead. [car racing] [tires screeching] Alright, hold on. [car crashing] Thanks. [car crashing] [tires screeching] [police siren] They took a right. I'm heading them off of the path darling. [police siren] We lost them man! We lost them! Told you. [loud bang] Oh shit! [car crashing] [car door] Freeze! What the hell are we going to do now? Half our cash was left behind. Cops will trace the numbers and then everything we have will be worth shit. We have to dump it all ASAP. I sent Tommy to sell as much as possible. Did you at least save the plates? Yes, I have them. Where are they? They're safe. Where? I said, they're safe. You know what the penalty for having this much counterfeit dough is? This much? Yeah. I was hitchhiking, and he picked me up. In a stolen police car? 20 years in the state penitentiary asshole! Now, give me a name! The name is Tommy. Tommy who? Tommy Johnson. * music Hi, Wade. * music Hi, Wade. Oh shit! Long time no see. Look, I love to stay and chat and everything, alright, but you know I got to go. You look nervous Wade. Not back on crack again are you? Shit! No man. I just say no to that shit. Crack kills right? Why are you hacking at me like this, man? I'm not doing anything. I'm just standing here being cool, man. I don't know anything. I don't know anybody man. You seem a little paranoid, Wade. Paranoid? I'm not paranoid. Are you paranoid? Relax Wade. We're looking for your old partner, Tommy Johnson. He wasn't at home. We thought you might know where he is. It seems he's passing some fake bills. No man. I don't know where he is man! I don't get any counterfeit 20s or anything. Didn't say you did. Did I say that, McKay? No! He mentioned it himself! Sounds like probable cause to me. What do we have here Wade? They're cops! [surprised] They're cops! [groans] Is that money real, Wade? Get off of me man. [indistinct] I'm not the only one who has it, man. Tommy came in here, passed the shit up. Everybody in the bar has that stuff. Not just me man. That guy has some, that guy has some... Everybody man! [gun firing] [groans] [screams] Get out of the way! [gun firing] [screams] [glass crashing] [gun firing] [groans] [gun firing] [groans] I'm out of here. [groans] Wade, you don't look too good. Oh, I bet that's gonna hurt. You shot me man! [groans] This sucks! I think you'll live. [heavy breathing] So, where's Tommy? He's staying at his girlfriend's over in Orange in Wilshire. [groans] Thanks! Hey Wade! Congratulate me, I'm getting married. Freeze! Hands on your head! Oh man, what are you doing? We're doing nothing wrong. Oh yeah? What's that? It's a little cocaine. But other than that, we ain't doing nothing. Hey Nick. You keep forgetting, are these things legal? Oh, probably not anymore legal than this. Hey man, the money ain't even real. Oh shit! I didn't mean that.. Tommy, I think we need to talk. [phone rings] Hello. Hi Tommy. Who are these people? What do I look like, a rat? You're my very good friend. I'm telling you they're cool. They'd better be, I'm trusting you. I'll send Nina. Alright [phone hang up] That's it. Tommy, you're beautiful. Isn't he great? A model citizen. [slapping] You need to make a delivery. To who? Tommy. I don't trust that fat bastard. I told you, we got to get rid of this shit. Tommy has already sold what he has and now, he has got another buyer. But he needs the paper. Besides, you're not supposed to trust him. You're supposed to trust me. [sigh] I'll pick up the guys on the way. * music Ready boss? * music Ready boss? Almost. Now, I'm ready. Me too. * music Announcer: Ladies and gentleman! The museum will be closed in 10 minutes. Please start making your way towards the front entrance. * music [case opened] * music [case opened] [case closed] [rustle] We got a problem. No kidding. [fighting] [groans] I'm going after the girl. So what else is new? [groans] [fighting] [scream] [groans] [scream] [groans] Haven't had enough yet? [fighting] [groans] Now you have. Nick! She's gone. Not quite. Drop your gun or I'd kill him. Don't do it, Kris. Let him go. I swear to God I'll kill him. Drop it! Now! [clank] [police siren] [gun fire] [gun fire] Nick. [groans] Don't leave me. [car screeching] [car door opens] [car door closes] * music [door opens and closes] Nina, what are you doing here? You set me up. What? We had a partnership and you sold me out. Nina! [gun fire] [groans] [things crashed] [police siren] Get your hands up! [gun clanks] [indistinct] Just give me one reason, just give me one reason! [jail door closes] Ms. McKay, what a pleasant surprise. You look tired. I guess you'll be hitting the singles bars again, huh? I'm sorry I spoiled your wedding plans. Don't take it personally. I don't even know you. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Well, actually, he was. Why did you come here? Well, I guess, you're not much of a talker today. So, I will excuse myself. Good day. Why? I beg your pardon? Did you say something? Why did you do it? Why did you kill him? That is a fair question. [sigh] I did it because I wanted to. Any more questions? I think you killed him for the same reason you killed everybody else, because you couldn't kill that one man you really wanted to. Your father is already dead. I see you've done a little research on me Ms. McKay. God! You're so smart. Yes, my father beat me, he abused me, and I'm just basing my rage on every man that crosses me. You're father beat you because you killed your mother. It's a lie and you know it. She died giving birth to me. I did not kill my mother. Well, your father seemed to think so. Yes he did, and he died before I was old enough to realize he was wrong. You're a pathetic little woman, Nina. So, you came here to tell me I'm pathetic? No. I came here to tell you that you're damn lucky that these bars are between us, and you better pray it stays that way. Well, it might not stay that way. Have you ever been imprisoned Ms. McKay? I suppose not. It's very cold, very lonely, very dismal. An empty cell. A chair with no one to sit in it. Out of sheer desperation, you end up talking to yourself, holding entire conversation with no one. That's what it's like to be alone, Ms. McKay. Get used to it. Coming out of the elevator. Ms. Lindell! Ms. Lindell! How do you-- Why did you do it? [rustle] [shouting] [rolling in stairs] You bitch! I'm gonna kill you! Do you hear me? Newscaster: In the Los Angeles courthouse tonight where she was convicted for the murder of police sergeant, Nicolas Taylor, Nina Lindell was literally attacked right on the courthouse steps. Her attacker was none other than detective Kristine McKay, the fiancée of the murdered officer. McKay, I know what you're going through. But there is no goddamn excuse. I'm gonna do what I can to prevent an IA investigation-- Yeah, just what we need. Internal Affairs crawling up our assess. Knock it off! McKay, you may have to take a vacation until this blows over. [badge banging] I quit. McKay, come on. It doesn't have to come to this. Probably better this way, McKay. Maybe we won't lose any more cops. * music [car stopping] * music [car stopping] [car door closes] [paper crinkling] [dog barks] [knocking] [door opens] I'm looking for someone named McKay. Hand me my paper. Pardon? My paper. You're stepping on it. I didn't think I was gonna make it. The police were arresting some gang kids up the street. You hear about drive-by shootings in neighborhoods like this. So, is Mr. McKay here? No. No? We had an appointment. My secretary set it-- I'm McKay. You're this McKay? You have a partner? Do you want protection or not? Well, yeah. I need a bodyguard. But to be frank, you don't think anybody would want a bodyguard who is a girl. I mean, do you think you can handle it? [groans] [thud] I doubt it. [door slammed] My lawyer is gonna hear about this! * music [police siren] * music [police siren] [chatter] [indistinct] prisoner in cell four has escaped. [alarm rings] [laughter] [loud bang] [groans] [metal clank] [gun fires] [groans] [gun fires] [groans] [helicopter approaching] [gun fires] [groans] [thud] [groans] [knocking] Yeah, yeah, I'm coming, relax! [door closes] I thought you're in the slam. What are you doing here? What do you think? I want my money. Well, right, your money. I'll get it. Have you seen Jake? I'm looking for him. No, I haven't seen Jake. You know things are a little hairy after you got busted. Clients got real paranoid. What is this? It's your money. I had 17,000 dollars. I told you, the clients got paranoid. No one was taking the play dough. The shit was useless alright? This guy offered me 200 bucks for the whole lot. 200 dollars for 17,000? For 17,000 shit dollars. Hey, I did you a favor. And now, I'm going to do you a favor. [gun fires] Adieu. So you're gonna get off your ass and do something today? I mean, look at this place, it's a dump. Why don't you, like, take out the trash or sweep the floor. Get some order in this place. The place stinks Flash. You just sit there day after day after day. [dog whimpering] Don't you miss life? [dog whimpering] Oh, neither do I. Do you think people get second chances? [dog whimpering] Well, it doesn't matter anyway. 'Cause if you screw it up once, you're just gonna screw it up again. [phone rings] Yeah? Is this Kristine McKay of McKay's Protection Services? * music [engine running] * music [engine running] Yes, may I help you? It's Kristine McKay to see Lawton Hobbs. [gate opens] * music [car engine stops] * music [car engine stops] [car door closes] [birds chirping] Excuse me, can you tell me where Lawton Hobbs is? Oh, you must be the plumber. Yeah, he is around in the back, you can just go on in. * music Where is Lawton Hobbs? * music Where is Lawton Hobbs? He is right over there. Are you the plumber? The cabana toilet is totally clogged. No. I'm not the plumber. * music [people chattering] * music [people chattering] I love ladders. I need a partner. Hey who wants to play with me? Excuse me. Are you the plumber? No, I'm not the plumber. What? Some sort of a singing telegram? You wish. Kristine McKay. Oh! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Forgive me. I'm Lawton Hobbs and and I wanna thank you for coming. Do you play ping pong? 'Cause I need a partner. I don't play ping pong. Oh, nonsense. Everybody plays ping pong. Come on. Alright. Zero. Zero. [ping pong ball bouncing] So here's the deal. I'm an entrepreneur, an investor, and a connoisseur. [chuckles] Come on McKay. Help me out here. Zero, one. As I said, I'm a connoisseur, connoisseur of the opposite sex. [ping pong ball bouncing] I love women. Women of all kinds. I love the beautiful, plain, sweet-- Come on. Sexy, sleazy, sophisticated. I like women in leather. Is there a point to any of these? I'm sorry. I got carried away. Yes. Last year, I was dating this woman. We got very serious, and I almost married her. After series of events, I found out that she was certifiably insane, so naturally I broke it off. So, you want protection from a psycho ex-girlfriend? She murdered a man. I refused to pay for her lawyer. She got life. She swore revenge, which I did not worry about until last night. She broke out of prison. What's the name of this woman? That's why I want you. It's Nina Lindell. * music I didn't come here to play games. [racket clanking] Hey! McKay. How do you know she escaped? Don't you read the paper? Do you know what happened between Lindell and I? Of course I do. You know and yet you still have me playing ping pong? [car door opens] [car door closes] Look. I need a bodyguard and you're the best person for the job. Get someone else. [car engine starts] [car speeds away] Look! I thought you'd jump at this opportunity. It's about time you showed up. [car stopping] [phone rings] Mrs. Goddard. Why didn't you tell me Lindell escaped? First of all McKay, you're not a police officer anymore, it's none of your business. Second of all, I'm not your message service. I'll call you back later. [car running] Hey! Is the plumber here yet? Yes. I believe he's upstairs in the bathroom. * music Jesus! * music Jesus! I'm just here to fix the toilet! Get out! [mini truck sped away] [gate crashes] Hey partner! It's the toilet in the cabana. You got something against plungers? You got something against plungers? [birds chirping] Nina! What a pleasant surprise! You're still a cocky bastard. You haven't lost any of your charm, I see. Nina, we have so many good memories in this bedroom. Are you sure you want to spoil them like this? You know exactly what I want. [birds chirping] Where's Hobbs? Upstairs. [chatting] [fighting] De javu Ms. McKay. [gun firing] [glass shattering] [gun firing] [screams] [gun firing] [window glass breaking] [thud] Get him! [groans] [groans] [fighting] [rustle] [fighting] [water splashes] Look Isaac, you don't have to play dumb with me. I already know you're an arrogant son of a bitch! So just tell me where Nina is 'cause I know damn well you know. I'm losing my patience here. Definitely losing my patience. You don't want that to happen. Get him out of here. We're talking about an escaped cop killer, Mr. Hobbs. I don't need to tell you how dangerous this one is. No shit, Captain. I dated her for a year and a half. Look! I have detectives specially trained for this kind of thing. I want McKay. I can't authorize that. You don't have to. I'm hiring Ms. McKay as my personal bodyguard. Mr. Hobbs, this is Sergeant Ostendorf. He is one of my best men, sir. I don't know how many times I have to go into this, but I want McKay. That's why I'm hiring her. Let me get this straight. You want a woman protecting you? Yeah. Who would you rather be with 24 hours a day? He is a qualified professional. Yeah, but he is not as cute. Sorry sergeant. You're not funny. Look! I know you have to do whatever you can to bring Lindell in, but I don't want a bunch of rent-a-cops hanging around my house eating donuts. I want somebody who is dedicated. I want somebody who has a personal stake in this and I want somebody who can give me a massage once in a while. I can't believe I'm on your side. [footsteps] You're the cockiest person I've ever met. I didn't know you're impressed. It's not a compliment. Yes, it is. Hey McKay! Wait up! Listen, if you find something out, I wanna know. You're not an investigator anymore. You wanna change that? Come and talk to me. Try to take care of this one a little better than your last boyfriend. Shut up. What? * music Here, let me get that for you. It's no problem. I want to. She's kinda cute, isn't she? Yes sir. [footsteps] Here you are. Don't you have butlers for that? They're busy. Room okay? It's fine. Make the house yours. Use everything, pool, jacuzzi, game room. Everything a growing playboy needs. Not everything. Excuse me. So, how'd you meet up with Lindell? We have mutual business associates. What kind of business. Am I in trial here? Should you be? I have enough real money Ms. McKay. I don't need the fake stuff. You didn't answer my question. Plastics. Plastic forks, plastic spoons, knives, cups. Plastic [indistinct] Incorporated. My father founded it. You've been on a picnic McKay? You probably ate your peanut butter and jelly sandwich off one of my plates. Plastic. It fits. Having this around is not gonna help you. Suddenly you're a psychiatrist? You're just easy to read. Listen up Hobbs, I'm not here for you to read me, I'm not here to play ping pong. I'm here to keep you safe. So, if you wanna flirt, just go find one of your little playmates. I'm not interested. Natasha. You remember their names? Breakfast is tomorrow, 9:00. Bring your good cheer. Hey Hobbs, we have a problem. Who called the plumber? My staff takes care of that. I know my staff for years. Clayton all my life. Read somewhere else. Isaac Barry? He's in room 13. I want you to do me a favor. You keep an eye on McKay. That woman is a tight wire. If she snaps, God help whoever's around her. God help her if she's around me. What do you have against this lady? Off the record? Yes. There is a war going in the streets, Captain. Now, I don't mind a female sitting behind a desk pushing pencils, but I don't want one in the battlefield with me. Hey it's the '90s. Woman don't put up with that shit anymore. * music Well, well, well. * music Well, well, well. Look who's back in town. I've been looking for you. Been right here, darling. Let's talk. * music You know, ever since the shop was down, no one seems to know where the plates have disappeared. Stranger things have happened. I want the plates. I don't have the plates, maybe you ought to go talk to Hobbs. I'm working on that. Are you hiding something from me? Listen baby, if I had these plates, do you think I'd be sitting here in this dive? Sorry. I'm a little tense. You know when a man gets out of joints, he got a whole lot of pressure he wants to be releasing. [chuckles] I bet that's all you need. What do you say? I've got this burning fire in my pants right now. We'll maybe we should put it out. Yeah. [water poured] Shit! Shit! Did I extinguish the fire? No shit! Let me put it back. Oh Shit! Jesus! Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. [door opens and closes] [beeps] Excuse me, who watches the monitors? Clayton suppose to, but usually no one does. [door opens] [door closes] [birds chirping] Clayton, who called the plumber yesterday? I did, ma'am. Your alarm system is off. You have a security system but no one is watching the monitors. That's my responsibility ma'am. I apologize. I don't want an apology. I just want you to do your job. Yes ma'am. That's what I'd like to see. Starting the day off in a good note. You look nice this morning. That's what I call a compliment. Generally responded to with a thank you or perhaps just a smile. Now, a smile is a facial expression displaying certain pleasant emotions like happiness or affection. I bet you can do it if you try. Stop acting like a child. I'm gonna hold my breath until you smile. I'm gonna hold my breath until you smile. Why is it that people like you are the ones that have so much money. Remind me to compliment you more often. Mr. Hobb's mother died giving birth to him. Lawton's father died of a heart attack when he was 12. It's my speculation that his childhood was taken from him at far too young an age. Would you like some eggs? No. Thanks. [footsteps] [horses running] [chattering] Charles, this is a great investment. LA. This is the deal of the century. I'm up to my ears already. Do you think that Las Vegas really needs another casino? Ahh, but this casino will cater only to the upper escelones of society. Dick and James from Duluth, Michigan. This is a sweet deal. The kind a sugar daddy likes. Sign it. Excuse me. I was wondering how much of your own money you have invested in his Mr. Hohnbaum. Who's this? Your girlfriend? Or your financial adviser? She's my bodyguard. Bodyguard? Answer the lady's question clearly. How much of your own money you got in this? Well, let's say I have a a definite amount-- Get down. [gun firing] Oh my God! [rustle] Stay here. Stay down. Sign. * music [fighting] * music [fighting] [groans] [thud] [horse running] What? You wanna get killed, that's your business but before you die will you please sign this cont-- [sighing] [horse running] [groans] [horse running] [gun firing] [horse running] [gun firing] [startled scream] [gun firing] [groans] [gun firing] [groans] Are you alright? Are you okay? Uh-huh. [water flowing] [door opening] [door closing] [water pouring] [limping] [groans] I talked to the doctor. He cannot help you, but he did recommend a good blacksmith. See, there's a smile. I must be suffering delusions. You got a good smile, you should use it more. Why do you have to be such a flirt? It's a compliment. I'm not a flirt. Oh yeah, right, you're a connoisseur of women. That's a title bestowed upon me by multitudes of women. Yeah, multitudes, I'm sure. Uh-hum, who surround me because of my-- Let me guess, because of your incredible charm. Because of my money. It could be your charm. How does a woman as attractive as you get to be a cop? Now see? That's charming. A bit sexist. A little sexism keeps women on their toes. A typical male statement. A typical female reaction. Men and women are different. Why do you want them to be the same? Who said I want them to be the same? You know, I didn't want to be a cop forever. I thought someday I'd raise a family. Just didn't turn out like that. Get some sleep. * music [door opening] So, what do you think about her Clayton? She's decent. You think she is better than my last girlfriend, Shelly? Kelly. Kelly. Yes. How about Sandy? Absolutely. Katarina? Most definitely. I think so, too. Lawton, this young lady is very--- Uhh. Yeah. I'm gonna get myself some coffee. Would you like some? I'm fine. Clayton? Yes? Thank you. [footsteps] [China tea set clanking] Who's the tea for? Ms. McKay. Oh. [metal clanking] Oh, dear. [groans] * music [birds chirping] Can I get you anything else? No. That's fine. Thanks. Wait. Wait a second. [Tea cups clanking] Maria, could you try this for me. I'm sure it's fine sir. I just want to make sure that's hot enough. What's going on here? I didn't hire you, did I? Nina did when she lived here. [groans] [scream] I'll call the police. Clayton. I was wrong about you. I'm sorry. No apologies necessary ma'am. You're good for Lawton and whether you realize it or not, he may be good for you. * music [footsteps] I guess I owe you thanks. You don't owe me anything. We'll thanks anyway. I'm the bodyguard and you ended up saving my ass twice. Your ass is definitely worth it. Besides, you saved mine twice, too. We're even. But it's my job. Another job I can't handle. [indistinct] seems to think you made one hell of a police officer. [sigh] Do you ever feel your life is falling apart piece by piece? Mine fell apart. I lost my mother, my father, my brother is gone and I'm still here. So, you had a brother? My brother was an artist. He made this for me. I called it the guardian angel. She spreads her protective wings over all those who stand before it. I guess she should have kept it to protect himself. Have you ever heard of this place? I'm looking for Nina Lindell. Do you know her? No. You can check the guy at the phone though. Yeah. I'll be home soon. I'm taking care of business right now. Yeah. I love you, too. Bye. Come on chuckledick, you're up. Alright, alright. Hey, you know even handicapped, I can still whip all your assess. [laughter] What about me? You think you can whip mine? I can do a whole lot more than that darling. Oh, yeah! You can roast some marshmallows over his crotch. Shut up Jimmy Lee! Rack 'em, big boy. Huh, how 'bout if I rack you instead, darling? I'm looking for an old friend. Her name is Nina Lindell. Have you seen her? Hey Jake! Didn't you have a barbecue with her the other night? I said can it, Jimmy Lee! And who the hell are you? I told you, I'm an old friend. So, have you seen her recently? Listen bitch, why don't you just get the hell out of here. I like it when you talk nasty to me. [laughter] [groans] [fighting] [loud bang] * music [glass crashes] * music [glass crashes] [fighting] [groans] [glass breaking] [groans] When did you see Lindell? Go to hell. [groans] No! Where is she? I don't know. She was looking for the plates. What plates? The counterfeit plates. What do you think? I told her I didn't know where they were but Hobbs does. [groans] [whistling] [whining horse] [birds chirping] [car rushing] [car door closing] You lied to me Hobbs. She does not want you. She wants the plates. I met a good buddy of yours, Jake Burback. Come with me. I wanna show you something. I can't wait. * music His name is David. He had a counterfeit operation with Nina. She shot him and left him for dead. He has been here ever since. [footsteps] How do you know this guy? He's my brother. Hey David. I brought a friend today. This is Kristine. Hi. Lawton. Yeah. I'm back in business. Oh really. She cool? She's cool. [paper crinkling] What do you think we can get for these on the street? I don't know. I've seen better. [paper snapped] Shit. It's because they don't give me the proper materials, Christ. I can't do good work with crayons, but what can I do? I just can't just ask for ink. [laughter] They'll know what I'm doing in here. [laughter] These are really bad, huh? Yeah. David, can I ask you a question? I guess. Where did you put the plates? [Laughing] What! You brought a cop in here. How could you do this to me? [laughter] I'm busted big time. David. She is not a cop. So, where are the plates? Would you like to know? I hid them a long time ago. Way before they threw me in this [indistinct] [laughter] Everybody wanted them 'cause they were so good. You know Lindell is out of jail. [startled scream] David. Get the nurse. Level with me, Hobbs. Were you involved in this? Of course I wasn't involved. It's just David. He always wanted to make it on his own. [car door opening] You know, you're the only person who knows about him, who knows he is alive. [car door closes] [car starts] * music [car stops] * music [car stops] [police siren] [chatter] [stretcher rolling] What happened? Neighbors came by and found the door open. I'm sorry. Where is the neighbor? I don't want to hear another word. Nothin'. You're not a police officer. This is not your jurisdiction. Shut up! Damn it. Leave him alone. Calm down. Get the hell out of here everyone! Just get the hell out-- Calm down! You get out. Okay, you're fired. What? You're fired. Now, get the hell out. You're out of this picture McKay. Lawton. You wanna get killed? She is after everyone. She killed Clayton, my brother. I don't want that to happen to you. I'm your bodyguard. Not anymore. Listen up McKay, from now on Sergeant Ostendorf here will be assigned to protect Mr. Hobbs. So, stay out of it. * music Well, now that we got McKay * music Well, now that we got McKay out of the way, maybe we'll make some progress. What you'd say there Hobbs? I got to ask you something. Why would a man want a female bodyguard? Shit, boy, where's your pride? Let me ask you something. Are you a sexist asshole because you can't get laid or because you're secretly attracted to men? You're not funny. * music Well, here we are again, just the two of us. Tell me something Flash. Why am I so stupid? I can't believe I actually started to care for that... that... [dog whimpering]. Why'd you let me feel that way? You know he's so... He's just so egotistical. He's childish. He's pompous. He's spoiled and you know he just thinks he's so funny. [dog whimpering] So what if he is charming. [dog whimpering] Yeah, he's handsome, tall, sincere. Well, if you think he's so sexy, why don't you go out with him? Do you think people get a second chance? Well then get off your butt and do something. Come on, let's go. [dog whimpering] Hi David, how you doing? Do you remember me? You probably don't want to, right? You know your brother cares so much for you. I don't know if you can hear me, but I think there is something that you really ought to know. The same woman that shot you, well, she is trying to kill Lawton. The only thing that can save him is getting those counterfeit plates. That's what she wants. I'll level with you. I was a cop, but not anymore. I quit. She killed someone really close to me. I'm not gonna let that happen again. * music David. * music David. You need to help me. Do you understand? Do you understand what I'm telling you? Please. Help me. [helicopter] Look. She's hurt us both. David, your brother needs your help. David, your brother needs your help. [helicopter landing] Are you an angel? I'm Kristine McKay. I'm just trying to help. I already have a police officer helping me. Where are you going asshole? [phone rings] Goddard. I'm on my way. Hello again... Nina. Oh, it's good to see you. Let me make you a drink. [groans] [car rushing] Ostendorf, you want a drink too? [groans] Is that a no? [groans] For the last time, where are the plates? In the china cabinet. [punching] [car running] Why are you hiding them? You don't use them. You're hiding something. Someone else knows where they are. Am I right? You're reaching for shit now, Nina. You're the one person who'll know where the plates were. [groans] [gun clicks] Where are the plates? Drop your guns. [footsteps] What're you gonna do McKay? Kill another cop? You're damn right. [fight] [glass breaking] [fighting] You hit like a girl McKay. Thank you. [fighting] Now you're pissing me off. [fighting] [groans] [fighting] [groans] [running] [groans] Nobody likes a dirty cop. [punching] [running] [car approaching] [footsteps] [speedboat running] [water splashing] [fighting] [speedboat chase] Okay, asshole. Start it up. Let's go for a ride. [speedboat starting] [helicopter starting] [thud] [speedboat crashing] [explosion] McKay, I expect a full report on my desk tomorrow morning. I didn't know I was coming back. I did. [car leaves] * music So, I guess I'm out * music So, I guess I'm out a bodyguard. I guess so. What if I need protection? Don't you carry that in your wallet? [chuckles] Yeah. For special occasions. Oh. You wanna join me for a special occasion? I'll race you. * music
