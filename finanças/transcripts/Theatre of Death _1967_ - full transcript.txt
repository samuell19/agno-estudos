THEATER OF DEATH This building, located in an alley... away from the conventional tourist route... once housed a church. For the past 60 years... an exclusive theater company is installed in it. Whose specialty is horror... as well as murder, mystery and infamy. These are the main ingredients of the "Th��tre de la Mort". The Theater of Death... Miss Gireaux's dressing room, please? - At the top of the stairs. - Thanks. In between. - So it was you? - What I? Who else would have spent a fortune sending me telegrams? - Here's to accompany you. - You are very kind. - Sit down, Charlie. - Thanks. - Everyone was impressed with them. - I hope so! I had the complete tour of Paris sent from several different offices. - Really? - Yes. - Your own dressing room, huh? - Yeah, it's a new beginning. It saw? I told you everything would be fine. If you hadn't paid attention to me, I wouldn't have made it. - Oh. Come on! - No. - Did you see the show? - No. They laughed at me! A jump seat next Thursday: that's the best you had to offer me. But judging by the applause, you were a great success! - Do you really think so? - Absolutely. Do you have plans for tonight? I wouldn't argue with an actress... especially on opening night... but wouldn't that be male speech? But our new director, Darvas, is having a party. And I thought you might like to come. - They would see me as a stranger. - Nonsense! It's a costume party. Try it on if it's your size. Well, come on, Charles! - Can you read my future? - Of course dear! No need: success, wealth, and a successful marriage! I can see it clearly. The fortune teller is Colette, our costume designer. And that's Joseph, it's the doorman. It's very good. And she is Nicki Chapelle, my roommate. Here... Keycards are... The queen of hearts means a young and beautiful girl. The three of hearts: a happy marriage. The three of diamonds, a rich marriage. The tower struck by lightning, problems, sentimental setbacks. A shock. The Reaper: Death! You shouldn't worry, Nicki. That won't happen. - Don't tell me you believed it. - It won't stop me from sleeping. Nicki, I'd like to introduce Charles Marquis. Charles showed me his friendship when I needed it. Yes, Dani told me. You've been wonderful to her. She certainly exaggerates. Nice to meet you. I don't know anything about theater... but Darvas knows how to throw a good party. It's a very good director. Oh! Here is Madame Ang�lique, the owner of the theatre. Come on, I want you to meet her. Com licen�a... Sorry to bother you, but I'd like to introduce my friend. Madame Ang�lique, esse to Charles Marquis. How are you? So what did you think of the show? I didn't get the tickets... - ... but soon I will watch. - Good! Hope you like it. It was an honor to meet you, ma'am. - Can you excuse us? - Of course. Are you happy to be working again? Well, it's not ballet, it's theater. And you, doctor, when do you resume work? - You are very insistent. - You still haven't answered me. I'm being treated. I didn't fully recover my motor skills. If you want your job back at the hospital, would they give it to you? Oh! Yes, they think I'm wonderful. - What happened to the other driver? -He was sentenced to six months. Six months? Is that after what he did to you? Well, you'll have something to do in your spare time. What do you do on yours? Don't laugh, I'm writing a novel. - Really? - And why not? Doctors are good writers... because they know a lot about people. Philippe ...What a wonderful party! Ladies and gentlemen! Ladies and gentlemen, your attention for a moment! I want to thank everyone for their hard work... that made today's debut an extraordinary success. But I think the biggest credit goes to our director... Phillipe Darvas. Madame Ang�lique,... cast members, this night is of particular importance... and it is a great joy for me. 25 years ago today... my father put on his first play in our theater. His father hosted a party in the same room. But it doesn't seem like it anymore. It's very modernized. He said that the "Theater of Death" was his whole life. And I say: why not? Theaters are full of paradoxes. To keep this tradition... to tradition two Darvas... I also intend to dedicate my life. Philippe, since tonight is a big occasion... Can't you reveal your plans for the future? Oh! Sim. As you wish. Miss Chapel... Miss Gireaux... Please come forward, please. Put yourself here, Dani. Perfect. Ah! Stay there. The pedestal. And that chair over there. Dani... Nicole... Something wrong? Wouldn't you prefer someone more experienced to play? If I wanted to, I would say, no? Sit down. I want you to do exactly what I tell you, Nicole. Did you understand? Exactly what I say... Voc� v� escurid�o... Nothing in the dark. This room and all its occupants are gone. You don't hear anything... nothing but my voice. On all sides slippery. No sound... except my voice. No sound except your voice. Give me your handkerchief, please. Thanks. What are you about to see now... It's a scene from a play entitled "The Witches of Salem". It's the story of two sisters. After the eldest caused the death of the youngest's lover... the girl takes revenge by accusing her sister... who is judged as a witch. The role of Sarah, the older sister will be played by Dani Gireaux. The role of the younger sister, Prudence, will be played by Nicole Chapelle. Understood? Ano 1692, Salîm - Massachusetts... Spring night. The location: the darkest area of ​​the city,... moments before Sarah Fletcher is burned as a witch. In the background, the sound of residents approaching. Firewood was piled up to form a bonfire. From the front, approaches Prudence Fletcher. Sarah? - Sarah? - Prudence? For God's sake, help me. Untie me, they're coming. I don't love God. That's why I can't do anything. Do you think I would allow it to be burned? No, I know not. Hurry up, untie me. I hear their footsteps, they'll be here soon. Don't be afraid, my sister. Did you think that even for a moment... that I would like to let the black hair ignite? Or let your sweet young flesh burn... or turn your velvet skin into a handful of ashes? When I, only I have that right! Pare! It just is! I don't think we've met, sir! No, we haven't met. Lesson number one, my friends, always captivate your audience! Engagement is the number one priority of any good theater. I must call Dr. Bernard? Wait amanh� of manh�. Charles! - I waited for you for hours. - I'm sorry, I was at a party. - Got your message on the way. - Did you have fun? Yes, we celebrate the reopening of the Theater of Death. If they saw reality, it would calm them down. You know, George, they're pretty realistic. They sometimes manage to make me jump. Eyes rolled by tomato sauce! - You're an obsessed old man. - Like all cops. Okay. It's too late to discuss the matter. - What do you want? - I want you to take a look at this. Turn off the light. H� tr�s. Appendix A. Appendix B. The second victim. - Is it recent? - Last month. And here is the third. All hit in the neck... and each with... What is it? A triangular wound? Proof that the murder weapon was the same, or similar. They were likely killed by the same person. Of course, a simple police officer could not come to that conclusion. Turn on the light. There is an obvious connection between the victims... other than the fact that they are women? N�o. The first was a midwife returning from a birth. The second was a waitress in a cafe in Halles. The last one, a student who went to music classes. - No sexual assault? - No. - Ferdi! - Yes, Inspector? Will you give me the autopsy reports on the three victims? In one minute. How is your hand? I am still under physical therapy and electrical treatment. And did it get better? Voc� n�o v�? I can drive. I can even write to some extent. But the one thing I really want to do... Esque�a. You're not going to give up medicine just because you don't like a scalpel. You've been one of the top forensic surgeons for years. Don't start. This is a ridiculous waste, Charles! You must work. I will decide when the time comes. Wine or brandy? Cognac, please. Did you meet Darvas? - Yeah, he's a character. - Just like your father. He disappeared, did you know? The case was never resolved. George, have you ever seen someone get hypnotized? They did it in a sketch that night. I've seen hypnotized patients but never has anyone been as suggestible as this girl. - Who directed it, Darvas? - Yes. It was extraordinary. I thought she was going to kill the other girl. Theater is made for that. She will probably have a big role in the next production. No, it was more than that. - Maybe he's some kind of Svengali. - Perhaps. - Here you are, Inspector. - Thanks, Ferdi. If you want to go eat, I'll watch the tenants. Thank you, this rush has whet my appetite. A crime scene photograph. This one is from the waitress. Not much blood. No. It's strange, isn't it? - Are they all like that? - All hit in the neck... in the carotid artery or jugular vein. Not a drop of blood left on the body, or nearby. I understand... In precise medical terms, this is called hematophagus. Someone who has an uncontrollable craving for human blood. In your language, that's what you call a vampire. No? Good morning, Dani! Good morning! - How are you feeling today? - Wonderful. - Shouldn't I? - Did you sleep well? - It was a fabulous party. - Yes, fabulous. I have such a headache. I think I had a lot of fun. - Any criticism of the play? - Yes. - What they say? - It's amazing! Look. And look at this! Here we are! We can pay the rent. The rent, a new rug and curtains! What do you say? Fant�stico! I must have gotten a little dizzy. I can never stand champagne. Two glasses and... - I haven't seen you drink much. - Me neither. Maybe I closed my eyes. In any case, I don't remember anything... After Darvas asks us to read the scene. Didn't I look ridiculous? N�o. - Don't you remember the sketch? - Not even a word. Was Darvas satisfied? - I think he enjoyed it. - Are you serious? - After interpreting, you fainted. - I never fainted! But he passed out. You were so excited I thought you were going to kill me. - Kill you? I didn't know. - Not you, but Darvas does. He hypnotized you. You could have killed me without you realizing it. - You're exaggerating. - No way. Look, Nicki... - Promise me one thing. - What? Don't see Darvas too often. It's the boss. This is an opportunity to spend time with him. Very good. In the theater, it's one thing. But from the outside, it's very different. Dani, you wouldn't be jealous, would you? No, I'm just scared. Nicole Chapel... I wonder... how can such a young girl have so much sadness in her eyes? It was winter. We had nothing to eat... and my family decided to cross the Alps in Switzerland. They filled the caravan with everything they had and left. We were about a dozen families. There was an avalanche... that blocked this mountain pass. We couldn't go forward or backward. No, enough! Don't be upset, Nicole. You're doing great. - Really? - Yes. After all, it's a long process. You play a role... in the true sense of the term, in the sense that I give it... It is a function of the unconscious rather than the conscious. Do you understand? - I think so. - Do you think so? But do you know? I want you to see me... like a master builder restoring a cathedral. Before building with new ideas... you have to take down the old ones. This is what I do with you! I'm taking away your mannerisms, your inhibitions, your prejudices. All that you have learned, accumulated and received from others... and these ill-digested notions of good and evil. When your conscious mind is sleeping... That's where we have progress. When you move on stage, you can use the right intonation... and you follow a precise gesture... you may not know exactly where this comes from. - Oh, I knew before. - Exactly! But in the background. Remember this. Philippe, I can't go on without you. I hope that voc never needs. Nicole... I'll show you what it means... interpret. Not superficially, but with the soul. When you make that laugh... and that cry. Like this. N�o! N�o, n�o e n�o! It's about a creepy old lady waving a glass of cherry! Peter, you're about to kill a woman! To kill! His gestures are embarrassing and stupid rather than wild and scary. The public must tremble with fear! Do you remember what I told you? The involvement! You, Heidi, you look scared like a baby with a rattle. But what are you thinking? I am hungry. I'm out of lunch. Imagine that I could sink this into your delicate little stomach. - Did you imagine? - Stop, you're hurting me! You are not so hungry now. And I see a little astonishment. Poor Heidi... - She'll cry all week. - Serves this idiot right. - Telling Darvas I was hungry! - Oh! Let's go! - It wasn't a matter of life or death. - I'm trying to listen. Think of murder, sit him down. Remember, like Heidi. Why did you go to Darvas' house today? Nicki, you shouldn't get involved. Perhaps you would prefer if you were the one to be invited. Engagement is the secret to good roleplaying. A good rehearsal? Charles! Yes. But what are you doing here? The medical research institute is close by. - I'll work with them for a few days. - Very convenient! Dani, do actresses get hungry? Are you asking me out on a date? For dinner tonight, after the show. I warn you, this job makes me thirsty. Need to go. I'm on the next sketch. I'll look for a restaurant with a good wine cellar. Perfect! - What a beautiful object... Can I see it? - Clear. - A Toledo blade. - Impossible to find nowadays. - Used to get dozens. - Are there still many? In so many years, many have been broken or lost. My nephew's birthday is coming up. If I wanted to buy you one, would that be possible? Try your luck at Monte da Piedade. This is not a toy, you know. A man knowledgeable in his trade... I could sharpen it into a lethal weapon. Thanks. This is not the right place. It must be placed here! Listen to this: It's hollow! There is a trap. The tip of the spear goes through there and not through Heidi's body, is that clear? Let's repeat the scene from the beginning. - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? Do you have a moment? Madame Ang�lique wants to speak with you. Okay, replace me. Well, one more time! If you don't get it right, at least try. Did you want to see me? Sim! If I don't distract you from an important occupation. No, nothing that can't wait for my return to rehearsal. I read your new scripts. E...? They are remarkable, not even your own father could have done better. I'm flattered. At the risk of sounding more self-centered than my reputation implies... I must say you are absolutely right. Didn't you come to call me at rehearsal to repeat that? No, not really. I remember Philippe... that you had told me twelve sketches, and I have only eleven. Yes, that's correct. The latter deals with the corrupting influence of evil on an innocent. I still need a few days to finish my research. Now, the voodoo sketch. What about her? Too bold for you? Thanks. No, I'm sure it's fine. Too close to reality perhaps? No, I'm sure it's fictional enough. Sorry. It couldn't be truer. Every detail of this sketch is based on facts. You amaze me. I have personally witnessed the ceremonies. It's fascinating. And these rituals of cannibalism are probably still practiced. But won't there be production problems? What for exemple? The transformation of the chief's old wife into a fair maiden. This is not a problem. Light effects, a puff of smoke, and voila! - Don't tell me you thought that too? - In the immediate transformation, no. After all, it's good to take poetic license. - I have to get back to rehearsal. - One moment! Another thing. - It's just a small detail. - Which? -Nicole Chapelle! - Well, what about it? You said the piece needed more dynamism. I think that was pretty clear after last night. And you yourself suggest that a change would be advisable? - Exactly, and my notes prove it. - Look, I don't argue. But you suggested putting Nicole in the four sketches. Five, including Faust. Nicole is a beautiful girl and a promising young actress. As we saw at your party. I agree. But she plays professionally for a few months. Do you think it's wise to give these responsibilities to someone so inexperienced? If I didn't, ma'am, I wouldn't have given it! A vagrant, known in every clinic in Paris. - Same triangular lesion. - Same absence of blood. - And first male victim. - I don't think it has any meaning. Take the. Have you seen this morning's papers? Four unsolved crimes... Taxpayers want to know what their taxes are for. You're not suggesting that this vampire thing be publicized, are you? N�o. - Nicki, are you back? - One second, Dani. Why didn't you wait for me after the show? You told me you were going out to dinner. I completely forgot. I owe you an apology for the scene at rehearsal. It was despicable of me. I'm sorry. This is typical of the start of the season. Late departures, rehearsals, parties... Everyone is under pressure. So she forgets. What do you do with this dress? Sorry for not letting you know, but I'm moving. - Tonight? - Yes. - Are you moving in with Darvas? - That's what he wants. - And you, is that what you want? - Yes I think. Ou�a, Nicki... No, it's useless, don't scold me! It's stronger than me. You know how it is Darvas! He manipulates people...! Al�? Pigalle 3506. Hello, Dani? Here is Charles. - Oh! Hello, Charles. - I'm calling you from backstage. Didn't you forget anything? Like me, for example? I just remembered. I'm really sorry. No problem. I arrived 10 minutes late myself. The age of the supersonic plane doesn't make traversing Paris any easier. - You are completely excused. - I don't know what to say. Say, "How about another time, Charles?" - Glad to. I will call you. Thanks. Goodnight. Goodnight. A thousand sorry... Ah, my impressionable rehearsal friend! Mr. Darvas? Can I offer you a ride? Thanks, but I live nearby. I can walk. Glad to! As you wish. - When are you leaving? - As soon as I pack my suitcase. To Constantine, from his beloved Anna. How do you find inspiration for your pieces? I traveled a lot. I also use materials left by my father. So, are you interested in theater? In some of its aspects. Your final number, for example. - The execution? - Yes. - And the vampire implied. - Implicit? I hoped I had been more explicit. It's possible. I'm not an expert. Are you interested in the vampire theme? Sim. You'd be surprised to learn of four unsolved crimes... currently on police records? All committed following vampire traditions. And all last month. I don't read the newspapers. Some aspects of the case were not publicized, obviously. It is wiser. It's not curious... Do you do sketches with vampires when these crimes occur? Sim, n�o �? These murders... - Who were the victims? - Three women and one man. - All hit in the neck. - Naturally. The weapon was a strange triangular knife... like those that voc uses in theater. I get off at the next corner. Sr. Darvas? - Sr. Tars? - These? I knew about your other disabilities, but I didn't know about the stutter. - I just left Nicole for the moment. - How interesting. She said she came to live here. Yes, it's quite true. If you don't have any objections, of course. She's just a kid! This may seem unimportant to you... but there is a latent spark in this child. This is a very deeply buried spark that contains pure talent. And is it possible that I master this spark... to produce an actress. Not a mediocre dancer... but a Sarah Bernhardt, or even a Garbo. - But asking her to live here...? - What difference does it make to you? Unless it's more to you than just a roommate? Either she's a prude, or she's jealous! And I don't think you're a prude. I noticed their gazes loaded with intent. However, it is already here and dared to interfere. It's better then to tell him why he's so unattractive as a woman and as an actress. Come here. Look at you! Look at you! Look at that makeup, it's ridiculous! The eye shadow is grotesque! We are actors and actresses, not swans in agony. Obviously, with your past, you shouldn't expect change. What does it imply? I see the accident did not affect your hearing... like your diction and your mind! Don't look so surprised. A director must investigate his artists' past. Your strengths, weaknesses... And I know you spent two years in an insane asylum. This is not true! I was hospitalized, and then at the nursing home. It was just a breakdown. That's all. You are a misfit! You're only happy when faced with deformities, aren't you? That's why you came to our theater, isn't it? You are a failure! I never want to see your pathetic face again! Not in my house, not in the theater! - I wasn't serious! - But, I yes! I will speak with Mrs. Angle tomorrow. You are fired! - What I'll do? - Don't worry about it. If the outside world is too tough, there's always a madhouse for you. If not, the river! Farewell, mademoiselle! Ah! Seraphina... Good girl! You are a perfect lady, Serafina. What were you doing in there? Charles, not now! - Dani, what happened to you? - Leave me alone! - Dani, stay away from that man. - Leave me alone! Mr. Darvas has not been found yet... and there is no concrete evidence of his death. Technically, he's considered a missing person. However, his hat and cloak were found covered in blood. So it is quite possible that he was murdered. Any question? Will they let us know when there is certainty? Clear. Can't we leave Paris because of this? Monday I go fishing. There will be no impediment. I won't hold you back any longer. Thanks. If he's not dead, what happened to him? I agree, you don't disappear like that. - His father disappeared. - Nobody ever found him. Nicole? Nicole... Do you feel ready for tonight? If you prefer not to interpret, tell me and we'll replace you. Thanks. When I was your age, I knew a man... much older than me. I was crazy about him. We were very close. Finally, he died. For months I was inconsolable. My dear,... we all know your feelings for mr. Darvas. Do you think you can go on without him? I don't know, ma'am, but I'll try. Well said! You care about that, don't you? - Charles, are you coming? - In one minute! The inspector asked me to help with the investigation... unofficially, of course. Meanwhile, until we catch this lunatic... I'll come pick you up and drop you off at home every night, okay? Okay. Half the company believes Darvas was a genius... - ... and the other half a bastard. - Fair enough, I'd say. Why didn't you tell me you took it home? I didn't think it was relevant. Charles, voc knows that... You are probably the last person to see him alive. The penultimate... Don't forget the killer. - I'm glad you remembered. - Oh, come on! - Don't tell me I'm a suspect! - Why not? Haven't you forgotten anything else? Like coming in, having a drink...? I left it on the corner. Did you see anyone near the house? It saw? No, of course not. Do you know what I think? I do not believe in the death of Darvas. - Why do you think so? - Just a feeling. And if he's alive, he'll try to get in touch with Nicki Chapelle. - Do you want me to keep you going? - No. I'll do it for you. Perfect, let him. I saw your girlfriend Dani. How will you act? I will go to the places where Darvas used to go: Tuilera... her favorite coffee shops, other places she frequented,... The park where we found the cape. - I wouldn't be thrilled. - Why not? I think he's dead. No, I know I wouldn't. But hurry! I don't think you have anything to worry about, ma'am. I don't think she can go on. It's almost as if Darvas is still here. Who would allow anyone to set their black hair on fire? Or does your velvet skin turn to a handful of ashes? When I and only I, who holds this right! Careful! No! She didn't know what she was doing. Just like at the party! - There's nothing strange about that. - Oh, no? So who hypnotized her this time? She could do this herself. As? It's not that rare, you know. This was done a lot during the war. Terrified men, going into battle hypnotized... and often hypnotizing themselves. They worked on decorating and repeating training instructions, things like that. You know how the scene ends. Just before Nicole stuck the torch in my face... she stopped and looked me straight in the eye. Very dramatic! You don't understand. I know this won't seem rational to you. But at that moment, when Nicole's eyes were fixed on me... I could swear they're not Nicole's... but those of Darvas. When your conscience is asleep... to which we progressed. When you move on stage... using the proper intonation... and you follow a precise gesture... you may not know exactly where it comes from. But inside... you will have it present. - Isn't she there? - No. Where can she be? Maybe he went out to eat, which is unlikely. - Or... - Or what? What's going on? He probably gave her a sadistic amytal. This will calm her down. And make it easy for her to talk. Charles, is he a good doctor? Perhaps the best psychiatrist in Paris. Don't worry. E ent�o? I confirm the hypnosis. She was mesmerized. Perhaps voluntarily. Could this stem from when she was mesmerized at the party? It's possible, but I would say, in my opinion... that she was hypnotized again, perhaps several times. - Why do you say that? - Based on what she said. You can break this... whatever you call it, this trance, this spell...? Probably, but the process is slow. A matter of making her abandon influences... behavioral change model... and then restore your confidence... until it becomes self-sustaining. - Sounds too complicated. - Could it be. Much depends on it. Before this happened, was she of stable character? Or was it emotional, neurotic? Good... She was moody. And it needed very little to stir it up... ou deprimi-la I would like to know Darvas' quality as a hypnotist. Because most of them prefer... working with well-balanced, phlegmatic people. Neuristic or suspicious, they are avoided like the plague. - Why? - Because you only unexpectedly. You can go see her now. The effect of the injection has worn off. - Thank you, doctor. - You're welcome. Can she go back to work? I think so. I can see you tomorrow morning. I agree with your theory, Charles. But I have never seen a person so strongly affected. You told me that Darvas died, and I can't deny you. But I say that someone... keep checking it. He knows,... I hate to admit it, but I think your cop friend must be right. I think Darvas died. Really? I'm not so sure. Well, the murders have stopped since his disappearance. - Until last night. - What? A whore. But I didn't want to upset Nicole. The same method as before. It will be on the evening news. Why do you think it was Darvas? For small details, but one in particular. When I hinted to him about vampires... he was very anxious to get out of the car. It looked like I had felt the house was on fire. Where is Nicki? - Somewhere over there. - We have to go. Nicki, come on, let's go to the theater. Nicki, what happened? What it was? Look, down there. What is it, dear? What do you see? Philippe... gone at the sound of their voices. - This piece was from Darvas? - Yes. He certainly knew aspects of the bloodlust syndrome well. Karl, have you ever been near a blood phage? Yes, occasionally. rare, but it exists. I'm not talking about cartoons with fangs that we see in the movies. But I know patients who experience a constant need for human blood. - A physical need? - Or mental, what difference does it make? The important thing is not that the body needs blood... but rather that the mind is convinced of it. And how does disorder begin? No one knows. But I can tell you one thing. I'd like to spend an hour with the author of this sketch. Darvas left a notebook with future sketches. When he disappeared he was working on one of them. - And it wasn't over? - No. Madame Ang�lique said he had left it to do some research. Ou�a... Find me that manuscript and maybe we'll make some progress. What are you doing? I'm digging around a bit to find one of Darvas' sketches. I saw you with Dr. Schiller in the theater. Did you talk about Nicki and the reflection you saw in the water? - With or without milk? - No, please. Yes. Surprisingly, if Nicki expected to see Darvas... she didn't try to run away. - Sugar? - No thanks. She was very affected when she heard about this new murder. The police have increased their team to find Darvas, dead or alive. What they really want to know is if he died like the others. Is this really important? Clear. Because if that's the case, even if he has his faults, he's not the murderer. What if he was alive? So I guess sooner or later... there will be an appointment in the morning with the guillotine. Dani... Even though there's something keeping Nicole here, there's nothing holding you here. You don't want me to leave you alone, do you? Someone else could take care of her. No, she trusts me. She needs me. Does she have no family? She was a baby when her parents died. I don't know details but I do know that she lived in orphanages and foster homes. Finally, she left to live precariously. With small jobs, singing in bars. - And that's where Darvas found her? - Yes. It's impossible to believe he died or even that he will one day. Dani... If you're determined to be with her, quit the theater for a while. That man understood something very well. I can only work in a theater like this. Nonsense! You are not sick anymore! This is the typical historical trap that Nicki fell into. Let's talk about something else. Would you like a brandy? You know, there are two practical advantages to babysitting. A: The baby doesn't cause us many problems. E B... We can enjoy the hospitality of Darvas... without being disturbed. Do you think she'll be okay? For now... eu n�o... I don't care. She plays very well. And his wife remains the best cook in Paris. Oh, I'll tell her. - Is it French? - Not by birth. I certainly have the best wife in the world. - Isn't it true, Charles? - Certainly. She never served at the restaurant. Her domain is the kitchen. And yet she still knows everything that's going on here. - It could be embarrassing. - For sure! She said: who is this Romanian girl? How did she know that? She recognized the tune. So you came to Romania? At the end of the war. What an adventure! - André, I need you for a moment! - I am going! Com licen�a. Well, now we know where it came from. She looks like she's having fun, but... There's no sign of Darvas. I don't think he'll show up. Otherwise, she would know. Forgive me, but I think I'm going to bed. Are you tired, dear? Thanks for dinner, Charles. It was a lovely place. Thanks for entertaining us. Goodnight. Is it my imagination, or is Nicki better? Yes, I think so too. Yesterday at the restaurant it didn't work as far as Darvas is concerned... but she looks like she had fun. They are nice people. And André invited us back. Only if Nicki plays for them again. I asked him to leave the guitar at the place as a guarantee! Charles, what is Leon complex? It's a Freudian term. Refers to someone who seeks eternal youth. The Peter Pan complex, if you will. Schiller believes that Darvas suffered from this. Oh! Dani, couldn't we talk about something else? You know, I think Darvas father and son... - ... are one and the same person. - What? Sim, como Dorian Gray. Do you remember the end of the book... when your young face breaks down in front of everybody? Dani, for God's sake! Enough talk about Darvas! No oh nothing supernatural! Dead or alive, he is a man like no other! Forget it! It was just Darvas stopping by for a little drink. Nicki? Nicki? Nicki? Nicki? Sketch 12: "A CARAVANA" por Philippe Darvas. "We winter in the Italian Alps." "World War II comes to an end." "A lone gypsy caravan is blocked by an avalanche..." "...in a small pass, high in the mountains." - Andr�? - Sim? Look at this. - What have? - Are these names not familiar to you? Constantine, Anna... - No. - February 1946, crossing the Alps. Two caravans behind us. Now you remember. - Do you think... that she is their daughter? - It's possible. Constantine and Anna were in the same group. Life became very difficult so we decided to migrate to Switzerland. We were forty. - We left at the beginning of February. - In February in the Alps? Yes, that was reckless. But we were desperate. We couldn't do anything else! And an avalanche had blocked the way. We couldn't pass. Some men killed a horse to share the meat. But a baby can't eat that. There were four in Constantine's caravan. He, his wife, baby Nicole, and a young man. A cousin, or something like that. When we were finally able to release the caravans... we discovered that something terrible had happened. A m�e, Anna... desperate to see that Nicole was going to starve to death, killed the boy... and fed the baby with his blood. " Travelers discovered the caravan with the baby..." "...and their dead companions." So you were the killer? I needed. E Tars? I thought he loved me, but he only loved the theater. He used me as the basis for his latest work. Your last black and white photo! I couldn't allow it. Who would have guessed it was you? He wanted me to play Anna, my mother. They'll find out when the body turns up. It has already appeared. The radio announced. So now you know he wasn't the murderer. E... Killing me won't help you. I don't want to kill you, Dani. But now that you know everything, I must do this. Just like I had to kill Philippe. You are the only ones who found out. Why don't you confess everything to the police? Charles and I will support you. Too late. Nicki, you're sick. doctor Schiller will attest to that. - You don't have to live with... - It won't change anything! - You're just going to be hospitalized. - How did they do to you? This is your only chance! N�o, Dani! You are my chance. With Darvas dead, the police will be looking for someone else. Someone mentally disturbed. And they will find you. And you will have to confess! Tell them you had to do it, Dani. You had to kill them. All of them... You had to do this, Dani! You had to kill them. All of them, Dani... You had to kill them. All of them, Dani... You had to kill them. All of them... "I beg forgiveness for the horrible acts I have committed." "...And so I end this confession and my life." Well, sign it. Come on, Dani, write your name! Now, this, Dani, and it will all be over. Come on, get it. Get up, Dani. One small gesture and you're free, Dani. Now! Okay, Dani. I'll have to do this for you. Of nasa it would help if they found you alive. Dani? Did you see a young blonde pass by? Yes sir. He entered the opposite door. Good. Call Inspector Micheaud. Tell him that Nicole is the killer. And to come to the theater immediately. Look for there. Two men over here and two over there! I received your message. Had lucky? No, she could have gone out the front. She won't go far. I have men everywhere. Let's control the spectators and search the theater from top to bottom. Darvas himself would have praised his scream. - But I didn't scream! - Phat... One minute, what did you say? I said I didn't scream. I don't know who it was. Sketch 12 by Philippe Darvas. "A caravana". If he knew the story, he knew she was sick. That's why he moved her here, to put everything in writing. He must have been aware that sooner or later they would catch her. Maybe he believed he was somehow immune... and that she would not kill him. He certainly exercised powerful control over her... and he had the audacity to believe it was absolute. He wanted to turn tragedy into comedy... and comedy into tragedy.
