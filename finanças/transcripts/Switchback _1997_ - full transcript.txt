[lane chuckles] [car rattling] [train horn blowing] god...damn! your 7 a.m. wake-up call. you know, you could have just given me a shake. i wake easily. my god. hungry? mcginnis: hector saldez... 8 priors. 2 assaults with a knife, armed robbery, conviction of second-degree murder in oklahoma, and now caught in possession of a murder victim's wallet and car. all you've got on him is possession of a stolen vehicle. he didn't know about the wallet till i showed it to him. i bet he didn't even know there was a body in the car. says you. ballistics have already matched the gun he used on my men as the one used to cap that john doe in the car. any more theories? jack, i think all frank's trying to say here is we need to keep our options open. there's no "we" in this, buck. i have the suspect in custody, and as soon as i get the green light from the d.a., i'm going to announce that saldez is being charged with the murders of those 3 people. don't do that. he's setting you up. you make that announcement, he'll kill again just to embarrass you. embarrass me? i suppose you've had that happen to you before, mr. lacrosse? yes. oh, i get it. well, you would like me to delay that announcement till after the election, wouldn't you, buck? that was a nice try. who the hell is this guy anyway? i mean, how many times you seen an fbi agent work a case alone? we can find out. don't have much use for us state and local boys, do you, frank? it's a prejudice i have, sheriff. no one's proved me wrong yet. well, i have my problems with jack myself, but, you know, there for a brief moment, i found myself thinking he was making a lot more sense than you. i don't care what you think, sheriff. maybe not, but you need me, or you'd be long gone by now. why believe me and not him? first of all, i've seen a hell of a lot more murders than he has, and these just don't seem to fit that man he's got in lockup. secondly... maybe you haven't noticed, but chief mcginnis and i are engaged in an election battle for my office which he desperately wants, and which i--i'm sad to say-- am desperate to defend. him? well, i'll take that as a compliment. but the fact remains he has a suspect in custody and i don't. but i'm here to tell you, frank, i'm not going to be worth a damn to you in this investigation unless i know what you know about this killer. ok. [country music playing] when i turned around and saw that 30.30 staring down at me, i thought, wow, this is it. no joining the birds this time. joining the what? old railroaders used to say that if you were on a train that was about to crash and you had a chance to jump, you were joining the birds. you worked on the railroad. for a while. mined a while, cowboy'd a while. fact, i did a little bit of everything up here. man: hey, fae, is this ticket right? how we gonna get through with the storm? ain't gonna affect us much. it's going north. what about you, lane dixon? what kind of work you do? i'm between jobs right now. before that. before that, uh... i worked in a hospital. orderly? nurse? well, i did a little bit of everything. [chuckles] that's what's in utah, a job? no. i've just been, uh...traveling. it's my first time west. cook: come over from alamosa? man: yep. how is it up there? man: it's not bad. worst of it's going north. cook: well, we've been watching it come down here for the last hour or so. how'd you know? my father used to say, "weather don't make the rules. mountains do." and i know the mountains. waitress: how y'all doing? we're doing just fine here. how about you, darlin'? get you anything? i'm ok, thanks. your friend's cute, but shy. i'm gonna get a paper. now, did i scare him off? tell him i won't bite if he looks me in the eye. [chuckles] [man coughing] [coughing] you all right? he's chokin'. he ain't breathing. call an ambulance. god damn it, fae, call the ambulance! fae: is he gonna die? let me look at him. i'm a doctor. get back. let him look at him. he's got something really jammed in there. god, he's turning blue. get in the kitchen, fae. god damn it, go on! get him on the counter. i'm going to need a first-aid kit. i need some alcohol. and give me that right there. open up his shirt. ok, open the bottle. now pour. fae: oh, my god. god damn it, fae, get in-- god damn! dr. dixon. don't call me that. hey, i didn't make that up. you called yourself one. it clears a path. don't give me that bullshit. what you did in there wasn't something you picked up out of some book. you've had training. now, maybe you've been in medical school and dropped out, or maybe you been in the army, but you don't lie to me that you're no doctor because i was just in the operating room with you. i don't want to talk about it. dr. dixon. he kills for the sensation of power. he started with the unconnected victim. no one missed them when they were alive, and it was a long time before anyone realized that they were gone. he is credited with at least 18 known deaths. no way of knowing how many came before he began telling me about them. he tells you about them. what's he do, call you? he writes. he sends me these. buck: why you, frank? i headed a task force that tracked him for 15 months. after the task force formed, he changed. he got bolder. he started taking more risks. he began to see the murders as a kind of competition. he turned it into a damn game on you. yes. and he took his publicity very seriously. but it got harder for him. he started making mistakes. we got closer. then 3 months ago... he just stopped. why? i don't know. he's been quiet ever since. [watch beeps] i need to make a call. go ahead on in and use the phone in my office, frank. there ain't no doubt about it. he knows this killer. [nate sighs] what are you thinking, nate? i'm thinkin' it's 8 a.m., polls are open, and i hope to god we're hunting the right man. it's me. amarillo. since about 4:00 this morning. no, i was too late again. they did? when? what did you tell them? don't cry, honey. no, i don't think that they know i'm here yet. we'll deal with that when it comes. i love you. bob: you're a strange one, doc. you're smart, cool under pressure. yet something's bothering you. fine. you don't want to talk about it, that's your business. i quit. i was a first-year intern. i was good. hell, i was cocky i thought i was so good. when it started to get heavy, i used to watch other post-graduates wash out, and i'd think, "that'll never happen to me." well...here i am. what happened? you have a patient die on you or something? yeah. hell, that's gonna happen. but you go home, get some sleep, get up the next day and try again. yeah, i did. it just, uh... i couldn't shake it, you know? well, you seemed cured today. this time. but what about the next time? what do you want, guarantees? there ain't no guarantees. what a waste. yeah. i've heard that before. yeah, bet you have. and like anyone else in your life, i got nothing invested in you. my father used to say, "nerve succeeds." you've got the nerve, doc, and i've seen it up close. if you really were a quitter, you would have stood around like the rest of us. deputy: as of 7:30 this morning, we have 6 reported missing persons-- 3 of those are women-- and 5 homeless who didn't report to shelters last night. rule out the homeless. he needed transportation. secretary: sheriff? mr. saldez's attorney, mr. martinez, is here, and he is breathing fire about mr. lacrosse shooting his client. thank you, becky. we really do need for this guy to cooperate with us, frank. mmm. maybe nate and i ought to talk to him alone. no. i'll talk to him. ok. mr. lacrosse? the lab reports just came back about that hair they found in the bed. it is definitely not saldez's. a 36052. i beg your pardon? special agent frank lacrosse, am i glad to see you. mr. martinez, thank you for coming in. i wouldn't miss it. i wanted to thank you personally for making my job of defending hector saldez such an easy one. really? how's that? how's that? how's violating three of his constitutional rights for starters? torturing him? illegally questioning him? failure to advise him of his rights? oh, mr. lacrosse, you're a godsend. jorge... may i remind you that your client was holding a knife on an innocent man? you can remind me all you want to, sheriff. it ain't going to mean jack to the jury. so i take it you don't wish to cooperate with us? [chuckles] what, are you kidding? i came here to thank you personally on behalf of my client who i will also be representing in civil proceedings against you and the city. good day, gentlemen. sit down, mr. martinez. you didn't hear what i said? i'm not staying. oh, yes, you are. what are you going to do, special agent? are you going to put a bullet in me, too? [knock on door] uh, excuse me, sir. the lab report just got back. it was a 36052. thank you, bud. nate: bud, what the hell are you talking about? i'm sorry, mr. martinez. i've wasted your time. um, what do you mean by that 360-- oh, that's a lab term. it's about a hair we found in the motel. we'll see you in court. lab term? yeah. 'cause, look, you wanted to know about the car, right? oh, that's no longer necessary. 'cause i--i could tell you if we made a deal. buck: jorge... deal... what kind of deal are we talking about here? drop the murder charges, and i'll tell you where he found the explorer. forget it. you know you can't prove anything. we'll see. sometimes you win, sometimes you lose, amigo. he boosted the car at the airport. long-term parking, lot "c." bud: get that list of stolen cars. thank you, mr. martinez. what about the hair? oh, yeah. it belonged to a male in his early 20s. brown. son of a bitch. son of a bitch. go back to the waitresses at the restaurant. see if that hair color sparks anything. you got it, mr. lacrosse. they teach you that little 36052 maneuver back at the academy, did they, frank? no. my wife did. and what is she, a con woman? sort of. she's a lawyer. airport security does have videotape on all the license plates coming and going from long-term parking. we're going to pull the last 24 hours and cross-check that with stolen vehicles. well, frank, it looks like you may have just gotten your first big break. i think we ought to make an announcement, buck. announcement? we don't know anything yet. we know it's not saldez. we can blow mcginnis' case clear out of the water. no. you do that, you'd be letting the real killer know that we're onto him. i think we'd be making a big mistake, buck. most of the folks in town here are going to be voting on their lunch hour. we still got time. is that what's going on here, winning an election? winning that election is my goddamn livelihood. now, i know you don't give a tinker's damn about that, but i've been working hard in this office for 15 years, and if jack mcginnis wins, buck olmstead ain't the only one who's gonna lose out around here. the only reason mcginnis has not made that announcement is because he doesn't have enough to charge saldez. and until that time comes, we just stand pat. becky: sheriff, telephone. sheriff olmstead. how can i help you? sheriff, grant montgomery, fbi here in dallas. i understand frank lacrosse is in your custody. well, he's here. he's not in my custody. well, i'll be arriving in a couple of hours to take him off your hands. mr. montgomery, he's working on a case here. shouldn't be. should be in philadelphia on another assignment, which he left 24 hours ago without authorization. and this isn't the first time, sheriff. he's left duty posts 3 times in the last 2 months. he's currently on bureau probation. you want to tell me what he did wrong? not your problem, sheriff, but i'd appreciate it if you'd hold him till we get there. what about your ongoing investigation with this killer? is that what he told you? there is no ongoing fbi investigation, sheriff. the case has been closed for nearly 3 months. that's impossible. look, sheriff-- no. you look! now, i got 3 people dead in this town, and you tell me you're coming to pick up the only man that seems to know what the hell is going on? now, i want some answers. i don't give a shit what you want. right now, the only thing that you'd better deal with is keeping that man in your sight till i get there. now, if that's too much to ask i can have a u.s. marshal in your office in 5 minutes who can handle that kind of responsibility. are we clear, sheriff? [hangs up] buck, what's going on? i don't know. lane: what's wrong with it? it's not tuned for this elevation. did you fix it? naw. just patched it till we get to the next town. and where is that? not far. find everything ok, frank? yeah. thanks. is this your wife on the horse? yep. beautiful woman. thanks, frank. we had 33 wonderful years together. she passed on... 2 years ago. i'm sorry. [sizzling] how about you, frank? where'd you meet your wife at? in law school. so you're a lawyer, too. i never took the bar. i did an internship one summer with the bureau and never looked back. any children? one. and what does your wife think about you traipsing all over the countryside chasing banditos? oh, actually, she's very understanding. that's key. sit down and eat. plenty more where that came from. no, thank you. nonsense. i make the very best blts in this part of the country. the secret's in the tomato. built a greenhouse out back-- he took my son. [sighs] you asked me why he stopped killing. we were getting close. we had several breaks. outside of boston, we had roadblocks set up within 20 minutes of a murder there, and he slipped through them. everybody felt it was just a matter of time before we nailed that guy. and then he took my son. and by doing that, he-- he removed you from the case. the bureau gave the kidnapping the highest priority. 2 weeks later, they found this man at a motel in wisconsin. his prints matched those found on my door, and with his body, we found detailed notes about the victims. dates, places, things only the killer would know. obviously, you don't think the guy's dead. it was too easy. i tracked this man for 18 months. i know him. he used that guy to end the chase. among the notes... they found this. that's my little boy. "believe." believe in what? i don't know. 2-18? 18 victims, 18th of february... day after tomorrow. i assume your people have checked all this out? yeah. they found nothing. what about your son, frank? do you really think he's still alive? i don't have a choice. bud: texas plate, 234-4s3. "james ruskin." ruskin. james... that's a hit. james ruskin, missing out of midland 2 days ago. what's he driving?

[breathing heavily] [chuckles] what the hell you think you got, 9 lives or something? huh? [creaking] whew. get on up here! [chuckles] you think that's funny, huh? doc! bob! bob! i got you, doc. [grunting] don't even think about trying to pull some local strings here, sheriff. i consider what you did to be a serious obstruction of justice, and i'm gonna make sure you remember this stay. damn, grant, you've got me quakin' in my boots. mr. lacrosse? yes. captain heber, colorado state patrol. i'm supposed to hold you till your people get up here tomorrow. mind if i have a look around, captain? be my guest. victim's name was clyde "shorty" callahan. no murder weapon was found. never even tried to pull it. we figure it was a blitz attack. how else can you do that to a man with a loaded .38? maybe he trusted him. we've still got roadblocks up on routes 10, 160, and out on 350. if he wanted to get out of this valley, he'd have to pass through one of them. i guarantee no cadillac has. what about the roads through the mountains, have they been checked? no need to. i can tell you right now they're completely impassable. nothing going in or out. [sighs] you don't think he made it past the roadblocks. he's not in the mountains. where is he? i didn't say he didn't get through the roadblocks. i said no cadillac like that has. i got a report that says there's over 200 stranded vehicles on i-25 alone. and that's just between here and pueblo. if he were heading to alamosa, the weather's worse. and i think when we start digging all those vehicles out, we're gonna find us one white cadillac. kinda got ahead of himself, didn't he? not even the 17th. i asked ruth to hold a room for you over at the railroad maintenance dorm over by the tracks. it's the only place in town. i thought you were supposed to hold me. well, it's 20 miles to the nearest lockup, and i figure if the killer can't get out, you can't either. thanks, captain. don't thank me. thank buck olmstead. damn shame about that election. won't be the same without him. [knock on door] howdy. good evening. you mr. lacrosse? yes. sign in here, please. terrible thing, that murder. you know, i used to baby-sit for shorty when he was just a little fella. i can't believe it. [train horn blows] good night, ruth. see ya, bill. you be careful up there now. bill: you betcha. [door closes] shorty used to do that. what's that? clear the passes. his wife made him give it up on account it was too dangerous. that's irony, isn't it? he gave up clearing the passes 'cause it was too dangerous. then he gets hisself killed in his own garage. well, here's your key. the room is out the door to the right. here you go, bob. nice. yeah. where is everyone, al? i thought this place would be packed. well, you can't get in, and nobody's getting out, so it ain't packed. [running water] how'd you all get in to la veta, anyway? ah, we hoofed it. little car trouble up on the mountain. you guys are really lucky. yeah. don't look like he held up to well. he did better than you think. wonderful, robby. tell sally it was delicious. will do, sheriff. i brought that little something you asked for. oh, thank you. i'll get you a glass. make it 2, will ya, robby? well, i see you've adjusted well to your new situation. care to join the recently unemployed in a drink? don't be so down, nate. it's not your fault. i just can't help thinking that... maybe we should have made that announcement. maybe. or maybe if he'd killed in midland instead of amarillo... or... if saldez would have had his little shoot-'em-up in our jurisdiction instead of mcginnis'-- who knows? maybe we should have turned him in. maybe we should've done a lot of things differently. [clink] but turning frank in was never an option. why not? 'cause he told the truth. once you've heard the truth, everything else is just cheap whiskey. i might have settled for it. no, you wouldn't. you're a good policeman, nate. you're gonna do just fine with jack. now you go on home and hug those children. give that pretty wife of yours a kiss and know that what you've done was the right thing. what about you, buck? me? well, as you can see, this whole experience has just devastated me. good night, sheriff. bob, good to see ya. you, too, hank. hey, bob. hey, tate. what's news, cubby? cubby: someone got killed over in martinsberg. they think it might be the same guy from amarillo? if they do, they ain't saying? state patrol say they're looking for a young fella. you boys seem to be up on all the news. well, hell, we been stuck here since the day before yesterday. haven't done anything but watch tv. well, then... it's time we get that pass opened up and move on. well, they're gonna send a crew up tonight. you're more than welcome to go with them. be like old times. in my youth, friend. in my youth. thank you, hank. now, what's your rush? uh, you see, the lack of female clientele disturbs me. uh, by the way, tate, you hear anything about the 218? martinsberg? last i heard, it's going up. but it don't come here. you know that. just asking. [train horn blows] well, they got the pass open. don't worry. the 218's the only train till tomorrow. [bells ringing] [train horn blows] [breathing heavily] [bird calls] [men conversing] [water running] first man: pass is clear, boys. got the word the pass is clear. second man: all right. thank you. third man: you ready to go? fourth man: you're full of shit, joe, you know that, right? third man: i know what i'm talking about. a cadillac. i know what a cadillac is. fourth man: filled with pictures of naked women, right? third man: that's what i said. fourth man: uh-huh. [turns off water] third man: i heard it on the radio. what about that car? you heard it, too? tell this guy it's the truth, will ya? it's the car that the killer in amarillo was driving, wasn't it? see? he knows. hey, stranger. how about this for a day? they sent a plow to the pass last night and had some luck. we got about 30 minutes before the train leaves. you feeling all right, doc? yeah, i'm fine. i'm just, uh... just a little tired here. sleep ok? yeah. thought maybe you heard the police were looking for a car like mine. white cadillac. yeah, i did. well, that car that they're looking for had texas plates. mine had oklahoma tags, remember? uh, yeah. that's right. you do believe me, don't you? yeah. it's just, uh, it's crazy. it just took me by surprise. you? how about me? well, i'm going downstairs to catch the weather. throw on your clothes, and we'll grab a bite before we go. ok. female weathercaster: frigid temperatures continue to blow in from the northwest, and it looks like we won't even reach the 32-degree mark until sometime this weekend. man on television: at cherry creek dodge, we've been steering you right with great deals for 16 years. now we've put special anniversary sale prices on every car, truck, and van... hey, doc. ready? where did you get that car? look, doc, i can understand your concerns, but you ever stop to think about how many white caddies there probably are in the great state of texas? probably a lot. i'd say more than that. but not that many with pictures. where'd you get the car? well, i lied to you. i wasn't taking it to no one. it's my car. bought it in tulsa the day before i picked you up, but that doesn't mean i killed anyone. stop right there. i told you it was a friend's because i figured you'd feel too uncomfortable if you thought it was mine. and i was right, wasn't i? wasn't i? i was gonna throw all those pictures out when i got to salt lake. they were a hoot, though, weren't they? those pictures?
