Russ? Come in, Russ. Russ, you got to get back here now. What? I'm on break. That was an order. We need help. There's been a-- Where? God damn. Hey, guys, enclosure 10 looks fine. False alarm. I'm going back for my ciggie break. Are you sending backup? I'm out here alone. If you me to go in there, you better send backup. Send it now. I'll check it out. I'll check it out. Get over here quickly. Guys? Guys? Don't cut out on me now. Oh, come on. This is not a good time. Come on. Fuck my life. I don't even want to find what I'm looking for. What the? Play nice. What's wrong with you people? Bunch of savages. Next slide, please. These are the types of species Darrow Industries is interested in at the moment. For what exactly, Mr. Smith? Pay attention, John. As you know, these mammals are almost genetically identical to us, yet they retain vastly superior senses and physical prowess. If we can somehow access those specific genomes and harness them, well, we may be able to usher in a whole new era of human evolution. That sounds interesting. Our competitors have been using these types of animals for years, and it's time for Darrow to show what we can really do. And what exactly do you want from me? You'll be analyzing the data of course. I want you to head up the team on this one, John. You've been with us a while now, and I think we can trust you. Well, thank you, sir. I appreciate that. Will I be out in the field with the specimen themselves? No, that's done in a more remote facility. Far too dangerous for a research team. But whatever you discover, well, it could be invaluable to us in the next stage of development. Next stage? Afraid that's above your pay grade for now. Understood. Believing they can change the world. Pathetic, isn't it? Pathetic is right, sir. We have veered off the path. But this, this project is key to getting us back. Where are my manners? I've kept you long enough. Go on. Go and see that lovely girlfriend of yours. Take her out for a nice meal. And tomorrow, you're going to be one very busy man. Thank you, sir. Hey, get everyone ready. It's happening tonight. Take this road and follow it to this point here. That's as far as you can go by car. The rest of the way will have to be made on foot. Take only what you need because it's going to be dark and dangerous. OK? Follow this path down. It leads us to the back door of the facility. Then we find a way in and locate the captive animals. And this is where we set up the camera and film everything that we can. What kind of resistance are we facing? We are looking at a handful of heavily armed soldiers. A handful? Mhm. Any plans to get around said handful? If we follow the path I've got mapped out, we should be able to bypass them completely. But once we're inside, we have to be smart and quick and quiet, Andy. So are we were sure about this? Look, you've all known me for a while. I'm not going to lie to you. There's a large risk element. But I've been working for Darrow for five years. That is a long time to be Smith's lap dog. And from what I've heard and from what I've seen, there is some truly horrible stuff going on there-- and not just animal abuse. There is a possibility of something worse. Like what? All these people have gone missing in the last 12 months. There's flyers everywhere. You think there's a connection? I don't know. But they were all last seen in this area here. What? And you just want us to go walking right into this Bermuda Triangle? Maybe they got lost in the woods or maybe they saw something that they shouldn't have. But we need to find out what is going on here. We owe it to them. We go in. We get our footage. We get out. And then we show everyone what we found. You think this is really going to change anything? You're a ray of sunshine, you know that, Pete? What they're doing isn't just illegal. It's inhumane. So yeah, if we get footage, they're finished. And then maybe the next company that decides to torture helpless wildlife for corporate gain will think twice about it. OK, I'm in. Yeah, fuck it. Me too. Me three. OK, well, get your gear. Get some rest. We'll leave tomorrow at 7:00. Get ready to change the world. Who wants pizza? Me. Yes. And a beer. What was that for? I am so proud of you. You mean us? Well, yeah, but this has been an idea for so long. And it is finally happening because of you. And I couldn't done any of this without you. I don't even think I could get up in the morning if I didn't have you next to me to wake up to. That is not true. Yeah. Thank you. And thank you for coming on this super secret mission with me. Oh, I like the sound of that. Promise me something. Anything for you. Good answer. If anything happens, you have to promise me that you will finish what we started. Come here. Oh, ow. Oh, my God. I stubbed my toe. Just breathe. It'll heal. Oh, thank you, doctor. Are we here? Yeah. It's about a click up ahead. Was a click? Really, Pete? We're almost there. I have a bad feeling about this. Hey, it's going to be OK. What if something happens to us? I mean, nobody even knows that we're out here. Hey, remember why we're doing this. She is right. What we're doing is illegal and stupid and crazy. You're not helping things. Hold my hand. As long as you're holding my hand, nothing bad is going to happen, OK? OK. Thanks, Andy. Are all these bases in the middle of nowhere? That's why they're called a secret base, Pete. I'm starting to think I don't want to know what they're keeping a secret. OK, let's get the gear, huh? It's the border of the compound, guys. So from here on out, we're in Darrow territory, so we got to be as quiet as possible. As mice. Yeah, make sure you bring everything with you because once we leave, we are not coming back. That's reassuring. Phones in the trunk. Sorry, what? Darrow has new tech. They can track phones even when they're off, so phones in the trunk. That's ridiculous. We're not going to just walk in there without any way of calling for help if we need it. Come on. No, I'm being serious. This is dangerous. He's going to get us all killed. Look, Faith, this is the job, OK? I get it if you want to stay here, but I'm not driving you back. Fine. All right. After this jog, the facility better have central heat because I'm freezing. Andy, Andy, Andy, keep it down. Yeah. Is there anything out here? What the hell? What's wrong? What is it? Animal tracks. They don't belong to an animal I've ever seen before. And they're too big to be human. Kind of looks like-- What? What, you think it's like a bear or something? Bears don't have toes. We should follow them. You're just full of great ideas today, aren't you? If it's escaped, it might be hurt, so. But we're headed in the same direction as the tracks anyway. We should keep going. Well, the track ends here. Oh, well. This is it. This is the entrance. Kind of looks like a cave. How stupid. So how do you get through? I'm going to have to pick that lock. I've got a kit. This area looks clear. Should we check it out? Yeah. I can't see shit here. Has anyone got any water? I've got some. Hey, where are you going? Nature calls. Come on, dude. It already smells like a sewer in here. Not my problem. New, optics, night vision. Did anyone hear that? It's probably just Pete finishing. Pete? Pete? Pete, if you're messing around, cut it out. You getting anything? I can't see him. Wait. Something at the end of the hall. Is it him? What the hell is that? Oh my god! Go! Oh, god! Was that a fucking monkey? Run! Do you see anything? Slowly crouch down. Make yourself small. Elena! We're nearly there. You're not going to die. Is there anyone in there? Who cares? Get inside. What are we doing now? What the fuck are we going to do now? You can calm down for one. Don't you fucking tell me to calm down. That thing just killed Pete. Are you OK? I'll be fine. OK, just hold on, all right? Hello? I'm trying to yell at you here. What the hell are we doing, John? I'm just trying to find something to clean her wound, OK? It's fine. I don't think he followed us. I don't think. OK, El, it's going to burn a bit, OK? If that thing hears us, we're all going to be dead. She's in pain, OK, Faith? It's OK. Just keep some pressure on it, OK? I need you both to calm the fuck down, OK? I'm calm. I swear to God. That wound is bad. We need to get her to a hospital ASAP. OK. So what are we doing? Call the play. What about that? The radio? Does it even work? I don't know, but we've got to try. No, not good enough. It's her best shot. And what about us, John? I mean, you put a call out on that thing, and Darrow is going to come down on us like a nuclear bomb. I mean, we are in real fucking shit here-- like never-heard-from-again shit. You're right. But we can't just leave her in the middle of the woods, can we? Not with that thing still out there. That thing just killed our friend. And that was on you. This is all your fault. You led us here. You put him in that position. I don't think you get to call the shots anymore, OK? We are not making that call. Faith, just-- I am. Fine, you do that. And then you three, you can just sit around and wait for someone to come along and arrest you for trespassing. But I-- I am making a run for it. No. No, that is the worst thing that any of us could do right now. Worse than calling whoever the hell is on the end of that radio? OK, OK, we need to calm down and be smart about this. We don't know who's on the radio, so we don't know what they're going to do to us when they find out that we were trespassing, much less when they find out what we were actually trying to do. OK, what do you suggest? I'll make a run for it, try and get to the city. What? No. No, that's crazy. If I can make it to the city, I can come back with the cavalry. And it won't matter what they do when they arrest you. They can't do anything. They'll never believe you. I think they will when I show them this. So what do we do? Sit tight. Don't move from here. And when you get in contact, feed them a lie. Anything. Tell them that we were hiking and that we got lost-- anything but what we were actually trying to do. Yeah. OK. When they show up, we-- we all just do the same story-- dumb and innocent. Yeah. OK. This is insane. This has got to see the outside world. You know I shouldn't let you do this, right? That thing is still out there. Yeah. I mean, who else is going to go? Well, I'm not about to let her try and run this. And you need to stay here and play medic. OK. What about the monster? I mean, Andy, if you go out, there you're going to get killed. No, no, don't think like that. Just please, promise me you'll come back. I always do, don't I? Wait here. Stay safe. Fix the damn radio. Lock the door after I've left. Wish me luck. Good luck. What are you doing? I'm just going to get a quick message out. Hey, just rest, OK? Come in. Does anybody read me. Over. Does anybody copy? Over. This is Fort Marion. We read you. What's the situation? Over. Please, we-- we were hiking and got lost. And something attacked us in the woods. And one of us is hurt, and we-- we need medical assistance. Send someone. Over. Hiking? You realize you're currently in a restricted area, sir? What are you doing out here? Please, you've got to send someone soon. Over. Roger that. Stand by for pick up, and stay inside. Over at out. Can't see shit, and you're being stalked by a giant, killer silverback. I suppose there are worse places to be. Screw it. I got to go right now. Fuck! Shit. Who is it? John, who's there? Hey, it's OK. They're here to help. Doesn't sound like it. Yeah, we're coming. Down on the floor. Jesus Christ! Down on the floor! Now! Yes, OK. Do as they say. We called you. We need you. Are you the one who made the call? Yes. She needs medical assistance, OK? She needs to get to a hospital. Shut the fuck up. I don't like this. So glad you could join us. Where's my girlfriend? I believe I have some questions first. Where is it? Where's what? The ape-- my ape. I don't know what you're talking about. What do you think killed your friends out there? The thing in the woods? That's an ape? I guess ape is somewhat misleading. It's actually a gorilla. More specifically, it's a genetic creation of ours and one we intend on retrieving. Look, I-- I don't know what you're talking about, OK? We got lost. We were hiking. You thought you get attacked by a bear? Yeah. Yeah, that was later. You can't even keep your story straight, can you? Look, there's no point keeping up the pretense anymore. So I ask you again, where is it? I don't know. Stop asking me questions that I can't answer, OK? We were hiking. We got lost. We went to the cabin. You guys showed up. Now I'm here. If it was so important to you, why didn't you put a goddamn tracking device on it? Tell me this, John-- John Anderson, 34, born in San Diego, one of three boys. Parents both deceased. Graduated with honors. Criminal record for involvement in illegal protesting and several unpaid parking tickets. Researcher at Darrow Industries and co-founder of Antifa eco terrorist organization-- The Way. All that sound about right? We're not terrorists. We like to do a bit of background research on all our employees. But trust me, that is the least of your worries. What I really want to know is why do you think you're here? Where's my girlfriend? I can see you're not ready to talk. Maybe some time in isolation will soften you up a bit. We don't know anything, OK? So just-- so why don't you just let us go? You're not going anywhere, John. Don't you get it? You're not leaving this place. This is where it ends for you. Consider it purgatory on your way to hell. Hey, colonel, I'll see you there. Ah, hello, there. Miss, Elena, is it? Let me out of this thing. I'm afraid I can't do that. We have too much to do. What do you want? I just want to sit here and watch. You just want to sit here and watch me struggle? You fucking sicko. No. Watch you turn. Turn into what? You have no idea what you're part of, do you? We know what you've been doing here. We know that you've been kidnapping animals and testing on them and killing them. We came here to stop you. And how did that work out for you? All this effort to stop animal testing, and now you're the one being tested on. Who are you people? My name is Doctor Kafka, and I'm here to change the world. You know what? We're on a tight schedule here, and I don't feel like waiting around. Are you serious? Dead serious. What did you think was going to happen to you here, John? We're going to expose you-- everything you're doing and everything you've done. You don't even know what we're doing here. Do you think it's a coincidence you ended up tied to that chair? What? We know about your adventures in veganism after hours. Why would we keep you around? Slowly feeding you information about this place till you were stupid enough to actually drive up to it. It doesn't matter. We're still going to find the truth, and you're still going down. Oh, you poor boy. Let me show you how much shit you're in. Allow me to enlighten you, Miss Elena. Darrow Industries is ushering in a new age in our evolution. You see, this country-- hell, this world has grown weak. Does that hurt? The only way to move forward is to go back. We must return man to his base instinct and reclaim our rightful place as the most dominant species. And you are going to help me, Elena. No, don't go near me with that thing. You see this little scratch will soon transform you, elevate you to what you should be-- the ultimate predator. You and I, we are going to make humanity great again. No. Wait. Please stop. Just listen to me, please. We're not weak. No people-- just because just-- because we care about the planet and people does not make us weak. It took us thousands of years of evolution to get here. Did you-- did you ever think of that? That maybe this was Mother Nature's plan? I prefer my plan. What the fuck are we doing here? I really don't like this. I really don't fucking like this. They come to get in here. Fire! Did we get it? Open fire! What the hell is this? Move. Move it, Sergeant! Move it! Now! Colonel, Colonel, stand by for now. We're under attack. Deal with it. Oh, shit. Come in, Private. Do any of you read me? They're dead, Colonel. You did this. No. Your pet did. Who are you? Fuck. Cock sucker. No! What is happening to me? You are becoming more. Like the thing in the woods? It's Kira. She's our most promising subject so far. I don't-- I don't want this. Oh, don't say that. I don't want this. Reverse it! I can't do that. You're lying. Fix it! There's no going back. We are evolving whether you like it or not. She's come home. My beautiful creation. Come on. Get up! See? This is what your tree-hugging pussies get going around telling everyone what they can and can't do all the time. I'm guessing you take whole milk in your coffee. Shut up, boy. And take your beating like a man. Do what you want. I'm still going to ruin your day. El? Kira! Elena? You! What the hell are you doing? Where is she? Let me go! Tell me! Are you crazy? It's right behind me. There you are. John. We have to go. I'm sorry, baby girl. Fuck. Fuck. Where's, Faith? I don't know. I thought she'd be with you. Do you know where we're going? No. In here. Come on. Are you OK? Your arm? It looks worse than it feels. What's happening to you? I think that doctor injected me with something. I'm-- Hey, hey, hey, hey. El, El, El. Hey. Hey, what's going on? What's going on? Did you hear that? Hear what? You don't hear anything? No, I don't hear anything. I think that something's inside me. OK, OK, OK, OK. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, it's OK. It's OK. OK, I got you. I know. I know, but I'm going to fix it. I promise. What? I don't know. Are you OK? Yeah, no, no, no, I'm fine. That guy did a-- did a number on the ribs. That's all. I'll be fine. Well, just breathe. It'll heal. OK, yeah. Good advice, right? Thank you, Doctor. Where are we? I don't know. Elena, I'm sorry. For what? It's all my fault. No. Yeah, Faith was right. If I listened to everybody, everybody wouldn't ever be killed in my view. No, no, no, this was not you. This was Darrow. They are the ones that created the thing that killed those people. It is not on you. It is not your fault, OK? OK, but that's not it. Then what is? I think I walked us into a trap. You think they wanted us to come here? That's what he said, yeah. I mean, they had a whole file on me. They knew I was the leak. You've been working here for years. I know. That's what I don't get. How long have they been planning this? We'll figure it out. How? Forget answers. We find just one bit of evidence, then this will all have been worth it. I don't think we're getting out here. Yes, we are. We're going to make it. We have to make it, so we're going to make it. Say it. We're going to make it. Say it. We're going to make it. Yeah, we are. Think you can walk? For you, anything. Right answer. All right, any ideas, big man? 1111. No. 1112. Hey, my Master Card pin! Who is my smart boy? That would be-- OK, your arm is fucked. Yeah. I can't see a thing. My eyes are killing me. Faith? Faith. Hey, Faith. Faith, wake up. Hey. I'm so happy to see you guys. Thank God you're OK. Hey, did they-- did they anything to you? Yeah, they just kept asking me the same questions over and over and over and over. And when I couldn't answer any more, they injected something into me. What was it? I don't know. Everything gets kind of very after that. I just-- I remember waking up in this lab. And everyone was suddenly gone. Yeah, they-- they evacuated. The thing from last night, it's here. It's in the building? It's a gorilla. Yeah, we just saw it. We just run away from it. Are you guys OK? Yeah. We're fine. What was that? Oh, fuck. How did that happen? I don't know. It was that thing that scratched me the other night. Now I just feel different. We really need to find a way out. Yeah, we do. But we're not leaving here empty handed. We're in it now, OK? Now, that is the lab right there, OK? I'm sure there's something inside. Are you in? Yeah. OK. Come on. What were they even doing down here? I have one idea. Oh, my God. What? This is one of the people that went missing. John, look at this. That looks important. It's locked. It's small. Is it light? Smart agency. Mhm. Not that smart. OK. Department of Defense? Government contracts? Yeah. Bio weapons, battle armor, chem bombs. I mean, this is super-soldier stuff. And so evil company does evil stuff. What's weird about that? Because we thought they were doing animal testing. They're not. They're doing human testing. I mean, so where are all the animals? And where are all the people? Enough of this. I think we just need to figure some shit out, OK? Of course there's a password. Don't-- don't get us locked out. Yeah, all right. Hey, pass me those papers. The evolution? All right, OK, there is a lot of stuff on here. Try searching test subjects or Kira. Try searching Kira. There. They're all dead. What did they do with them? Let's see. This one reads Bruce, 48, a gambler from Soho, London. Keep going. Brian, 36, a drug addict. Diane, 28, an alcoholic. Freddy, 31, homeless, no background-- perfect candidate. What does that even mean? Here, look, Kira, a prostitute from Brighton. She was 23. She was just a fucking kid. So why them? I can't look at this anymore. No one was going to come looking for them. Police are hardly going to bend over backwards for a missing prostitute, are they? OK, so that thing, she used to be a person, yeah? They were brought in as subjects. But why us? This shit's different. It's got to be. It's got to be the way, right? I mean, he had a whole file on me. And we were protesting outside their building giving them all that bad press. They get rid of us, they get rid of the movement. Two birds, one stone. Fuck. Fuck, I'm so fucking stupid. No one could have seen this coming. This is what Smith was talking about, OK? Fusing primate and human DNA trying to make some kind of-- Monster. No. Super soldier, OK? And it's not going to happen to you. It's already happened. It's going to be OK, yeah? Hey. I don't feel so good. OK, talk to me. El? You're OK. You're all right. My head. OK. I've got you. El. El, stay with me. El. Hey, hey. Do something. I don't know what to do Hey. El. Hey, El, stay with me. El? Oh my god. Is she-- No. No, she's alive. She's just-- she's just passed out. OK. She's getting worse fast. We need to get her out of here. You stay with her. Why. Where are you going? I'm getting us out of this fucking bunker. Yeah. Yeah, OK. OK, just come back to me. Oh, fuck. What the fuck did you do that for? I'm sorry. I need to eat. Elena? I feel hungry, and it's all I can think about. El, we're friends. Listen, listen, you need to-- you need to fight this, yeah? Please. Just look at me. Look at me. You know who I am. You know me. I'm your friend. I need. Please, help me. Who are you? They called me Zero. I was the first. First what? Subject. The rest are all gone. OK, I'm sorry. I need to go. I'm sorry. Help me. I can't, OK? I need to find an exit. My friends-- I know a way out. You do? I watched the guards. I've learned the exits. OK, tell me. Take me with you, please. I'll show you the way. OK, how? There. OK, stay close. Can you walk, yeah? You better be right about this. Faith. Elena, what the fuck are you doing? El, El, El, El, wait. It's me. It's John. What did you do? John? What happened? Faith? I killed her. You ate her. Oh my god. What the fuck do I do now? We must go. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to do it. It wasn't me. OK. Hey, hey, guess what. Guess what. I found a way out. Yeah, we can go home. Do you want to go home? OK. But I-- I need you to stand up, OK? You can do that. OK. Hey, don't look. Don't look. OK. Come on. Keep going. I need help. I've got you. Zero. Come on. How much farther? What if it happens again? It's not going to happen again, OK? It's not. Please. Please! Oh, John. Keep going. You've got this, all right? It's through here? Follow Zero out. It's happening again. El? OK, OK. Hey, hey, hey, hey, stay with me, yeah? Just listen to my voice. Fight it. You've got this. Come on. Listen to my voice. Yeah, that's it. Thank you. Hey, what is it? It doesn't matter. We have to keep going. Stop. Kafka. Guys, we need to go. I said we were going to make humanity great again. You are not taking that away from me. Rot in hell. Kira. Does it hurt? No. I'll be fine. Anything I can do? How are you doing, Zero? Zero? Got to stay with me, huh? Just tired. Yeah, OK. What's your real name, Zero? I can't remember. You can't remember your own name? Can't remember much. What did they do to you? They took blood, bones. Put something else. At first, I felt fine. But it just got worse. Is that what's going to happen to me? No. How did you survive? They-- they wouldn't let me die. Darrow's going to pay for it, Zero-- the genetic testing, all of it. They're finished. El. No. What are you doing? I need to eat! You need to snap out of it! No, I can't. It's like an addiction. I need to. El, stop! Oh, fuck. Zero, are you OK? Zero? She's going to die out there, El. What about us? Kira. She's still coming. We have to go. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. El. OK, hey, hey, El. El, I can see the road. I can see the road. Yeah? John. Yeah, what is it? I can't. Yes, you can. Whatever I have inside me, it's taking me over. I can't go on anymore. We're almost there, yeah? El. OK. El. Hey. You have to go. What are you talking about? It's not going to stop. We are so close. We're so close. We can make it. No, John, you can make it. Don't do this. It's not going to stop coming after us. We can make it. It doesn't matter where we go. I can hear it inside my head. She's talking to me. I am drawing her to us. But I can't. I can't. I can't just leave you. You have to. You are not safe. And I'm not going to be myself for much longer. I can't go on without you. I wasn't expecting this. This is on you now. John, you have to tell them. You have to tell them everything that they did to us. You have to tell everyone for me. I love you. You've ruined my fucking life. Elena! Hey! Hey, over here. John, what are you doing here? You can't be here. You can't. Kira! Kira. You don't have to do this. Kira. If you're still in there, you don't have to do this. What they did was terrible. But they don't have to turn us on each other, Kira. El. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey, stay with me. Stay with me. Stay with me, El. Hey. I'm so sorry.
