Hello... Yes, mummy. Yes, I'm fine. What about you? Yes, studies are going good. You know it... going good. Well, I was saying that... Uh... I had purchased a mic. For my movies to have clear sound and avoid noise. But it was cheap, and the quality was similar to that of the phone's mic. So, I called you because... I searched for more mics on internet... Available to buy... At affordable as well as a bit high prices. Bro, what you think isn't true. I told I'm an exception, right? I just called her to say that I wanted a new mic. She changed the topic from there to nowhere. College... studies... career... She pronounced career as "carrier". Carrier... Are you sure there won't be a problem? Means I'll be allowed to write the exams, right? Next week when the college with re-open, my life will become all the same. This struggle of mine... might last for 3 years, I guess. Fine, leave it. Not meant for you. Whether they mark the attendance or not, I've kept a record with me... about which days I did and didn't attend. Yes. I've kept a diary recording the activities and the number of days I went to college. 30 days. Before holidays, 30 days. After it, more 30 days somehow. Mummy, don't get stressed. Well... Nothing will happen, seriously. Yes, nothing. Well, I'm hanging up. I've to study. Really? It's so good that for the first time, you've praised a film of mine. It's great if you liked it. Really... And my previous film selected for the film festival has completed one year today. It's good if you've seen that. Yes, yes. Of course. Why not? Yes, mummy. Fine. Show it to Papa as well. Only heart knows its matters, No one understands what it thinks... Only heart knows its matters, No one understands what it thinks... What really are those difficulties, due to which no one understands... I do remember your... all the promises that... you made to made to me... False consolations like this... false excuses like this... why did you give them to me? Why did you give them to me... O time... O time, What did you just do? O time... O time, What did you just do? Yes, exactly. That's why I ended the call. Again... Your same drama started again! Look, I don't care. You know that studies don't matter to me. I agree that studies are a good thing, but... it's far from my capacity. I can't do it! Why're you after me? Not every person is made for everything. Hang up. I don't want to study. What's wrong with that? Nothing's wrong. I don't want to go... I don't like going to college... I don't want to go. When did I say that studies... are useless? I did say that I don't like studies. But I never said it's a bad thing. Someone from your place has leaked it. Because to who else am I speaking about this? My photo, which only you have, is trending. Only you have it. I have got a new one. I always told you not to lie about me to anyone. Just stick to my words and don't fake them in front of others. But you say that... "It's our tendency to do this thing." Saw the tendency? Saw your tendency? People are abusing me... Questioning my character... Only because of you! ONLY BECAUSE OF YOU! IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU! YOU DID EVERYTHING! HANG UP! My filmmaking career... is ruined even before becoming successful. No, that's not the case. There's not too much difficulty. Bro, it's not that I'm really facing difficulties in making films, but... I want that... Filmmaking to be full time, studies to be part time. But my parents have made studies as full time and filmmaking as part time. That's not good. Now, I'm making an action film in which... the lead character... imagines killing, attacking and fighting people. He takes pleasure in being a hero in his imagination. That's why he visualizes and kills goons in his imagination. Yes... It's my original concept... I don't steal. Seriously, I can't tolerate this noise. Otherwise people can even ask "Why don't you know how to edit audio?" I don't have the software. How can I edit? The best solution is to mute the audio. Mute the audio, that's the best thing. Nothing else needed. So much noise here... It's not even like 5 or 6 vehicles, but... At least over a 100 vehicles pass from here in a minute. And the problem, but, is... It's been over a year crying. How long? I don't want to cry anymore. Tomorrow, I just have to wrap up my film's shoot... and just... take a decision that would change everything. Everything.
