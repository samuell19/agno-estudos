'KADHALIL SODHAPPUVADHU YEPPADI' "Love.." "Love.." "Love.." "Love.." Are you ready? Okay. Please move and sit together. Feel comfortable. Okay. Where did you first meet? What was your experience? Will you say it? - You should. You should. - You should. First day of college! I saw her for the first time, in the canteen. She was wearing a red salwar. She was cute and chubby. She came.. - I was not chubby. Not much, just a little. Only then, now you aren't. I wasn't chubby even then. Your chubbiness is your beauty. So.. - So am I not beautiful now? Will you say it? - No, you can. No, You should. - You should. You can. Whether it's love or hate - 'Five months later' boys can't show it, as much as girls do. Right now, I'm watching a girl's hatred reach it's peak. Parvathi! My girlfriend, until that day. In that second, a lot of things ran in my head. I thought of all the happy memories we had, in this very canteen. I thought of how my life was going to be miserable from today. I thought of why the canteen couldn't use paper cups! It was just a usual fight. It will be solved in few days. She will come back to me. 'Two days later' What does she think of herself? That, I cannot live without her or what? Let her go! I don't have to do this. 'Three days later' I can't take it. I want to see her immediately. It's been five minutes since I called her. Shall I try again? She will not come back. Just move on. How can I forget her? It was my first real love. It's difficult to forget immediately. I know. But you can start trying immediately. Don't waste your time thinking about her, try to divert your mind. Eventually, you will forget her. Sorry. I'm always annoying you, talking about this. That's fine. I can't share these with anyone else, except you. I understand. Everything was going good. Even if we fought, it never extended more than a day. We used to talk about it and solve it. Should I have been patient? Now she doesn't even pick up my calls. I don't know how she can just forget everything in one day. She is a very good girl. Sorry. I'm always annoying you, talking about this. I don't have anyone else with whom i can share all these. I'm not used to all these. I've always had things easy, right from my childhood. For my parents, I am their world. My father is a lawyer, dealing with domestic cases. Perfect husband, perfect father! Vasanthi. My mother is a housewife. I am my mother's pet. My mother controls the whole house, including my father. Right from my childhood, my parents have always been a part of everything i did. Out! - You don't even know how to bowl! Gosh, listen! Throw the ball onto the bat! Why haven't you polished the shoe? Wait, let me put it on, then I'll polish it. I've never had to face any challenge in my life. That's why I wanted a challenge at least in pursuing my dream girl. My dream girl.. Parvathi. Oh, God! I wished for a small challenge. But I didn't expect it to be so dangerous. I can't forget her. Every single one gave me different opinions. Have a drink. - Look for another girl. Talk to me. People will understand only if you speak out. Alcohol is the best. - We can write a story about this. Drink, dude. - Drink, dude. Have a good journey, with good friends and a good atmosphere and then, drink. Most of them asked me to drink. But I can't do that. Because my heart is already in a bad condition due to someone I don't want to damage my kidney and liver too. But that's fine. Some of them spoke to me as if someone was dead. I got to know about what happened. I always knew, this wouldn't work out. All girls are like this. - So, you just had a breakup? I thought it happened long ago. Hi, my name is Raja. I heard that, Parvathi and you are no more in a relation. I'm very sorry about it. Can I get her number please? Tau is equal to 'T' - 'U'. And divide the order of integration. Hence, we prove the relativity theory. Who wants to know about relativity theory now? The girl whom I loved so much, is not with me. I shouldn't have let her go. I should talk to her. She will understand me, for sure. She will come back to me. Arun, don't you understand? She is gone. She isn't going to come back. Never! Sir How can you say that? I know about Parvathi. She will come back. Oh! you are great. She won't come back, you idiot! I can't take it. That's the problem. I don't care what people talks about me. I will definitely meet her today, and i will talk to her. Here she is. Parvathi. Parvathi, stop! Parvathi, stop! Because of you, I have four stitches on my head now. At least for that, talk to me for a minute. Are you trying to act innocent? Why are you making a big deal out of it, Parvathi? When we are angry, we say things which we shouldn't speak out. The very next moment, i realized my mistake. I am fed up, Arun. How long will you keep apologizing? Do you think it will solve everything? I don't have the strength to bear this anymore. I am already facing enough problems at home. Why are you connecting everything together? It's not just that. You are not the same anymore. Why not? Because I've lost the trust that you'd always keep me happy. You know how much I loved you. I meant what i said, i am not blabbering? I can't force myself to love you, Arun. It's difficult to continue the relation, after a breaking point. I promised you, that I would be with you forever. You broke that promise a long time ago, Arun. You need to understand that this is over. Please leave me alone. I don't understand why men and women have to live together. It doesn't seem to be right, from any perspective. Why is he like this? - What's wrong with him? I've decided to live without being in the trouble of love. I am not in a mood to sing. Please.. Hey, what's wrong with him? - We should sing! What I was talking about? - Dude, talk to him! Yes.. - What do we do? I don't know what I learnt from this relationship. But I learnt very well, how to fail in love. I told you! Guys.. - "I fell in love before I could realise anything." "The world seems different, when in love." "Even if we sing a hymn, even if I almost die in love" "Why is everyone" "a beautiful failure in love?" "a beautiful failure in love.." "Hey! Mind your own business, make use of your studies." "Let me sing out my sorrows." "I have tried to call her a 1000 times." "My name, no more exists in her phone." "Those messages with all the apologies" "she dumped it like trash." "It's over, it's over, I don't have anything left" "and I stand alone in the crowd." "Parvathi.. You left me in the middle of this journey." "Parvathi.. You ended the story of these beautiful hearts." "Parvathi.. You concluded it with just a word." "Parvathi.. You saw my love burning into ashes." "I fell in love before I could realise anything." "The world seems different, when in love." "A beautiful failure in love." "Hey! Parvathi.." "Why did you go away.." "What was my sin, my dear God?" "Why would my life always sink in tragic stories?" "I am left all alone, i don't have anyone to be with me." "There's no one to embrace me, while riding on the bike" "No one to take me for a movie and change my mood" "Who will be my motivation, here after?" "It's over, it's over, I don't have anything left." "Parvathi.. Left me in middle of this crowd." "Parvathi.. You showed me the bitter side of this sweet kiss." "Parvathi.. You ended it like a beautiful conch song." "Parvathi.. I am the one suffering all alone." "I fell in love before I could realise anything." "The world seems different, when in love." "Even if we sing a hymn, even if I almost die in love" "Why is everyone" "a beautiful failure in love.." "a beautiful failure in love.." "a beautiful failure in love.." "a beautiful failure in love.." Don't make it obvious. Slowly, turn around. Keep looking. Yes, dude. - She is in first year, ECE. We both come in the same route. She keeps looking at me. In the library, canteen, college bus.. This is the first mistake. The most important thing about girls is, they are like paintings. Have you seen the eyes of any painting? Wherever we stand in the room those eyes seem to be looking at us. Girls are the same. The girl we like seems to be looking at us, always. Because that is what we want. So, we assume that is the reality. It's an illusion. Hey, she is coming. If 1000 violins played a symphony together how would it feel? I am in love. The next mistake. I guess you should talk to her. - No! No, are you kidding? I can't do it. Vignesh has a problem. He doesn't know how to talk to girls. Hello! Hi, Vignesh. Hey! This is because of an incident, that happened long ago. Sunflower boys and honey bee girls, please form a line. Each honey bee girl will be paired with a flower boy. You should remember your pairs. Okay? Usha, pair up with Ashok. Shiva, come here. Sofie, pair up with Vignesh. Sofie, go to Vignesh. - No, I don't want to! What happened? Go and stand with Vignesh. No.. - What happened? Sofie.. Wait! As he had to deal with a rejection at that age he is afraid of girls. Don't you worry. The girl who rejected you is the elephant boy's girlfriend, now. Hey! Shut up. He studied in IIT and is in a very good position and handsome now. Get lost. - You get lost! Go away. - Go away. He's useless, let's go. Don't bother about it, man. So, if Vignesh goes and talks to a girl all those negative thoughts start running in his mind. And ultimately, he ends up too scared to talk. Hey, you don't have to go and talk to her, you just have to grab her attention. - How do I do it? Show your attitude. Nowadays, girls don't like good boys they like bad roguish guys. They go in search of them. I suggest, you should rag a junior in front of her then she will get to know, who you are. Hey! Don't do it. He is not used to ragging people. Shut up. Don't worry, this will work. Generally, the main reason why boys mess up with girls is such advice from such stupid friends. He talks so much. But look at his condition. Shiva, he can never get along with girls. Idiot! - Rascal! Are you even a human? I'll hit you! If you keep sending my daughter letters, I'll hit you! If you send me any more letters, I'll hit you! He preaches so much but has he ever thought, why he doesn't have a girlfriend yet? I am blessed, to have a friend like you. Hey, now, among the juniors from this bus let's select the worst two. How about them? Hey, I am really afraid. I haven't ragged anyone before. Let's not do it. - Don't worry, I am here. They should get scared, just by your voice. Call them with full confidence, say 'Hey!'. Let's not. - Just call. No, I can't. - Call them. No.. - Call them! - Hey.. Hey, come here. Yes, we meant you two. Come here. Can you dance? - No, sir. What about march past? Yes, sir. Okay, imagine that there is a bicycle here. Pump air in it. Okay, sir. Pump air while doing march past. Okay. - The bulb above, got fused. Fix it. Why did you stop pumping air? Why did you leave the bulb? Don't make fun of him, he might cry. You said you couldn't dance, but you're doing it well. Hey, do the same. No, sir, I don't want to do it. - No? Hey, do it. - Hey he is scared. I told you to do it. No, sir.. - Buddy! I think you will have to make him do it with a slap. Just do it, you don't know about me. Let me go. - Hey! Give him a tight slap. Sir! What are you doing? Why did you hit my head? - Hey.. The task was simple, right? - Why would you beat me for that? Don't shout, sorry! - Enough of it. I don't want your apology. Hey, let's go. Hey! - How dare he! But why did you hit his head? Did he shout in front of everyone? Yes. Is that it? Is it over? No, it isn't. - But whatever it is you shouldn't have hit him on his head. I can't live without her. Even if I fail the first time, there is a second chance, right? Hey you are experienced, right? Please do tell. I still don't know whether to support him or not. Because my first attempt was bitter too. 'My love story. One year ago.' I'd bunked my class to write my record in the canteen. That's when she came. Hey! That's his order. Excuse me, I want a sweet lime juice. Sweet lime is over, please order something else. Okay, I don't want anything else. Leave it. You can have this. I think you need it more. Do you think I'm here for charity? What? - I don't know why guys love making use of girls' weaknesses. I understand, I think you're in a.. - Shut up. You know nothing about me. Okay.. If you want you can have it, or else leave it. I am sorry for disturbing you. Hey, cancel the cool drink! People say, that first impression is the best. But that day, even I felt awkward like Vignesh. I thought it was over. But after two days Sir, I need to recharge my prepaid phone. The phone is there, you can do it. I have something to calculate. - I need an 80 pages notebook too. Take it. Sir, please give me a notebook of 160 pages. Notebooks of 160 pages are over, he took the last one. I asked you for 80 pages, right? Shall I give the book to this girl? Do you think I'm here for charity? No, I asked for 160 pages. I will pay you tomorrow. Okay. - Bye, sir. Excuse me. Excuse me, one minute, please. Did you call me? For practicals, they have asked to get notebooks of 160 pages. Oh, I needed only 80 pages. I assumed you might scream at me, saying you don't need charity. That's why i walked off. I am sorry, I wasn't in a good mood, that day. It's okay, please take this. - Thank you. I am Parvathi, from second year, Computer Science. Arun, second year ECE. - Okay. Thank you. I will see you. - Okay. I didn't know whether she liked me or not. Even if she did, I'd never get to know. Because girls never show it. After that, we occasionally met in the store, unintentionally. Whenever we met, we did spend some time together. Then we started to plan our unintentional meetings. Even though we were friends by this time I didn't have the courage to ask for her phone number. And she too didn't give me her number. We had study holidays for 10 days. After that, semester exams would start. You will start your studies from tomorrow, right? That's always the initial plan. But I keep postponing and on the last day, it's all piled up. Exactly! And the day before the exam, I will sit and study the whole night. It's the same, in my case. Even if we have so many days we will understand what we study, only at the last minute. Exactly! But you know what? I have decided to start preparing for exams a bit early and write the exam peacefully. Is that so? - Yes. Okay, all the best. Okay, I need to leave. Okay, best of luck. Let's meet after the holidays. Yeah! Bye, then. - Bye. Hey, Parvathi! - Yeah? I-I wanted to ask you something. But forgot what it was. - About what? I don't know. I've blanked out, completely. Okay, sit and think at home, and tell me once you remember it. Even if I remember I can ask you, only after the holidays, right? Yes - So, we will meet then. Why are you laughing? Are you striving so hard, just for my number? 9633432211. Send me a message, I will save your number. Okay, bye. - If you remember, then tell me. What? - You wanted to ask something, right? Oh, that! I wanted to ask for your number. You are such an idiot! - Bye. "I don't know whether I fell or got lost." "A little emotion made my heart overflow." "I am plucking imaginary flowers." "I imagine giving them to you." "Time slows down" "When I start thinking of you." "The only truth I know" "is burning a hole inside of me." "I yearn to know whether you feel it too." "Call me.. Will you?" "For every moment of my life?" "I feel restless, waiting for that call of yours." "Call me.. Will you?" "I am restless" "I'm counting every second to sunrise." "I rehearsed what I want to say." "I imagined your responses too." "I tried so hard with this charade" "I even left pauses for your sweet smile." "If this goes on" "what shall I become?" "Before this fades away" "I really wish for your call." "Call me, will you?" "With all your might, will you call?" "I am going crazy. Just call me, will you?" "Call me, will you?" "I have lost all my sleep" "I count the days" "to see you. Will you call me?" "Like an unfinished meal" "like an unfinished song" "and like the magic that made me wish." "Listening to you makes my heart skip a beat" "I became a blossom" "that blooms and withers." "My heart is stuck somewhere else." "Call me, will you?" "Without fail, will you call?" "If you call without fail, that is enough. Will you call me?" "Call me, will you?" "Call me, will you?" "Even if our speech is brief" "A silence is enough. Will you call me?" Hey, Arun. Are you active on Facebook? I use it at times, Shiva is the one who forced me to create an account. I am not interested in it. I have sent you a friend request, accept it. Why do you want to use Facebook now? Whom will you flirt with, at this age? You will not understand anything. I can connect to clients with it. I knew you would say this. We won't be able to survive, if we don't update ourselves. Arun! Who is this girl? Which girl? The one in this photo. She is a friend of mine. A f-friend from college. Oh! Vasanthi. - What? Please come here, see Arun's 'friend'. What is it? Can't you see that I'm working? 'Friend'! She is a 'friend', it seems. - Oh! 'Friend'.. You never said that your 'friend' is so beautiful. That's what I told you, Mother, she is my 'friend'. That's what I'm saying, too. What's your 'friend's' name? Why don't you go and cook? I am leaving for a movie. Bye! Will your 'friend' come for the film? Wait! Hey, we have been waiting for you. Where are the tickets? Is everyone here? Yes, everyone is here, except Parvathi. I tried calling her, but she didn't pick up the call. Try once. Hello! - Hey, Paru. Are you not coming for the film? No, I don't think I can make it. What happened, is everything alright? You seem so low. No, I am not feeling well. No.. It's okay, no problem. I will pay the ticket price. No, you don't have to do all that. Please take rest. Okay, Arun. Have fun. Okay, bye. - Bye. Hey Arun, Arun! Come, it's time for the show. Paru? I wanted to ask you something. What is it? Why didn't you come for the film? Is there any problem? You don't have to answer me if you don't want to. I won't ask again. Nothing like that. My mother and father had a fight, and he left the house. What? When did this happen? Do you remember, I screamed at you in the canteen? A day before that. They're still separated. I am with my mother and my father lives in a separate house. They had a love marriage. My father doesn't have a regular income. He invested everything in business and we are sinking in loans, now. My mother is earning. Even if he earns somehow without my mother's knowledge he'll invest it in some business and waste it. That's where the fight started. After that, they started fighting for everything. And one day, their fight went out of control. Enough, I can't listen to you, every minute and work accordingly. I cannot tolerate this. Who is the man in this house? Someone who keeps his wife happy. Keep your mouth shut, or else, I might slap you. Okay, hit me. That's the only thing left to do now. I just had a small request, why are you behaving this way? Is this your small request? You will never understand how much I sacrificed for you. Investments don't have immediate returns. We need to be patient. I started going for work, on your word. If you think that isn't enough, i will have to go rob. If you'd go to work regularly, it'd be enough. How can I be regular, at a job I don't even like? My dreams and my peace of mind, I lost everything because of you. You don't have to do this for me. I will take Paru and leave this house. You can be happy. Are you trying to threaten me? You're saying all this, because I listen to you. Why should you leave? I will leave. Let me see how you'll manage the family without me. I am used to this situation. But sometimes, it's hard to manage. That's why I did not come for the film. I knew that it wasn't a normal incident that happened just now. I knew that she wouldn't share all this with anyone else. She was trusting me for some peculiar reason. She was comfortable, talking to me. I wanted to hug her and console her. I felt so important. But I didn't know what to tell her. I was not used to all this. I felt that she took our relationship to the next level. We became closer to each other. It was my turn to take the next step. But didn't know what it was. This was the best vacation in my college life. Hey, what is with all these books? Why can't you help me? Hey, be careful. Okay. Hey, I am bunking tomorrow. The college just re-opened, and you are bunking immediately! It's my cousin's child's naming ceremony at my grandfather's house. The whole family will be there. I'm meeting my cousins after a long time. So you will be very busy tomorrow, right? Will you reply to my messages? What is this? Hey, I am planning to do M.S, in America. I am trying for admission in Carnegie Mellon University. Are you going to U.S? I am preparing for GRE and TOEFL exams. The books are for that. Instead of doing it abroad, you can do it here also, right? But it won't be the same, right? It has more value. And also, it will be a new experience in a new place. Are you going to visit the place, or to study? You can do it anywhere. That's my dream. What's your problem, if I go there? I will miss you! Really? Because, talking to you has become a routine for me, now. Won't I miss you? Don't blabber. I know you won't miss me. I can't help it if you think that way. Okay, then let's see tomorrow. You are going for a family function. You will forget me, once you are with your cousins and relatives. You will not even message me once. No.. The function will go on but I will be texting you. Let's see how much you miss me. Arun, come fast. I'm coming. - Everybody is already there. We're late. Make it fast. - I'm coming. Won't you even comb your hair, even when going somewhere? Please come, Mom. - We are late. Mom, I forgot my phone. Dad, please turn the car. Hey, are you joking? We don't have time for all that. Dad, please.. - We are going for a function. Are you going to sit with your phone there? Just come. Dad, please.. - Hey, be quiet. Please come inside. Arun, how are you? All good? Yes, Grandmother, I am good. - Are you studying well? We'll leave after lunch, right? We are here, till evening. Arun! - Okay, we will leave now. Bye. Okay, Arun let's leave. - Come. Open the door, Mom. - Hey, why are you in a hurry? Why is he running like this? I was feeling giddy. My limbs were weak. My body was shivering. That's when I understood, that I am in love. Are you feeling giddy? - Yes. Are your limbs weak? - Yes. Is your body is shivering? - Yes. Definitely, this is viral fever. I will prescribe you tablets, and you will be alright. Cheer up! Cheer up! Why can't viral fever and love come together? This is definitely love! "Love, Love.." "Love, Love.." "Heart beats like drums, when in love" "Thermometers can't handle this love" "This love never leaves, this happy disease called Love" "Happy disease called Love" Love, Love.." "Love.." "Love, Love.." "Love.." "Love, Love.." What? Why are you leaving so early? - I've got work, Mom. What happened? I'm scared, Arun. Scared? Why? Do you know how much I missed you, yesterday? Do you know how much I missed you? I was restless, until I saw your message, last night. I was going mad. You won't understand, Arun. What? When my father left us, it was very hard without him. You won't get it. Even though he wasn't responsible he loved me so much. But he didn't even think about me for a moment, while leaving. Now, I lost that trust and love for him. That day, I decided that I shouldn't be attached or dependent on anyone. But when I realised how much I missed you yesterday I'm scared. Like my father if you also leave me I won't be able to come out of it. Hey! From now forever, whatever happens I will always be with you. Okay? Okay. What if you go to America? What will I do then? I'll not go to U.S. I won't go anywhere, without you. I love you. Why did it take so long to say that? I felt like I found a new meaning to life. When she looked at me I felt like the most important person in the world. I used to question myself, every day. How did I survive all these days, without her? She used to talk talk for hours. Whenever she spoke Ilayaraja's music played in my mind. When she was with me it felt right. I thought nothing could go wrong. But after one year.. I told you it was only fever, did you listen to me? "Love.. Love.." 'My love story' When my own story went haywire how could I encourage Vignesh? Maintain some distance from the girl, for a few days. Don't do anything for now. Wait for some days. Okay? He maintained distance. But not how I meant it. Yes.. - We should.. - After 7.. What are we doing here? The leopard hides first, while hunting and later, attack. You're the leopard, come. Okay, bye. Hey, she is going to the library. Really? Does our college have a library? You would have seen in the movies how the hero and heroine stand on opposite sides of a bookshelf and select the same book. Try something like that. Hey! Sir, I forgot to bring my card. Can I get the book without my card, just once? No, I can't give the book without the card. Just this once, sir. This is very urgent, sir. You can use your friend's card to get the book. If you want, you can use my card. Thanks. - It's okay. Is it okay with you? What if you need to take books? Why would I take books? What? I mean, I do. But I've already read all the books here. That's why.. - We need your signature in the register. Why, sir? You need to sign before you issue a book for the first time. He wants my autograph. - Yeah, sure. Something good happened. Why are you tensed? I just helped her. I don't know whether she's impressed or not. Let it be. The wave of love has started, between you two. Hey, here she comes! Hi, my card was on the desk in my class. So, I went and changed it. Anyway, thanks for helping me out. It's okay. - Bye. Hey I've decided to tell her. Awesome! How're you going to propose to her? People have a million ideas, on how to propose. I'll sing in front of everyone. I'll give her a letter and run away before she opens it. I'd do it in a silent restaurant, over a candlelit dinner. I need him to write a poem for me and propose. I'll propose through SMS. I hate boys who propose through SMS. I won't beat around the bush. I love you. Do you love me or not? That's all. But however hard we plan it almost never works according to plan. Okay, cool. Just do what you've practised. You can do it. - Brother! Brother! Do you still have your first year ECE books? What happened? I love you. Idiot! How can you propose to a girl who called you 'Brother'? Hey, why are you being negative? It will work out. How? She called him, 'brother'. Don't worry. She will think about your proposal and won't be able to sleep tonight. The only thing she can think of will be you, saying 'I love you'. Why are you being so stupid? - Shut up. This will work out. Love is taking over him. Only God can save him, now. Hey! You will go to her, today and tell her whatever you feel. Your speech should just.. - Hey! Brother! - Don't call me that! No, Brother. - No, I'm not your brother! No, Brother, please listen to me, I'm in love with someone else. Who's that? Final year student Jayasimha. Good morning, sir. Hold your ears. What are you doing here? What? Are you ragging her? - Oh, no! How can we rag our own sister, right? How'd you feel if your heart was wrenched out? If you think, only boys fail so miserably girls don't choose the right guys, either. If a girl loves a boy, there's no limit to her love. But some boys would want the love love, from more than one girl. But there's one thing. If boys make even the smallest mistake, girls will find out. Hello. Hey! I'll call you, later. Who's that? - A friend. Oh! Because girls have a special super power. Intuition, we just know. One day, all of a sudden, he got sick. Right then, I had a doubt. He doesn't usually fall sick. Later, he kept his phone on the canteen table and went to order. There was a call from an unknown number. I picked it up. There was hesitation, then, a girl said, 'Hi.' When I asked her who it was, she cut the call immediately. It's so obvious. Do I look dumb? Nobody can fool me. Unfortunately, most of their intuitions are always right. It's a sad thing, when girls cry, right? Actually, more than boys girls have many dreams, when they come to college. But they choose in a hurry. And shower all their love to that one guy. Imagine, how hurt she'd be, if he hurts her! Whether it is love or hate boys can't express it as much as girls do. This is applicable for all ages. Mr. Prabhu? - Yes. My name is Akilan. I had called in the morning. Yes, come. Please take your seat. Tell me. What can I do for you? - Sir It's been four months since I applied for divorce. Actually, my wife had applied for it. Mutual consent. They said it'd be finalised in a month. If you could help me out with the paperwork, that would be great. Actually, in this case, I don't have much work. But before coming here, did you meet any marriage counselor and try to sort this out? I don't think it will help, sir. It's been like this for so many years. It won't change now. Well, in that case, I can start the process. Okay, sir. - After all the paperwork is done there will be a final court hearing, that's it. Alright, sir. - Just one question. Are you sure that you want a divorce? Yes, sir. Please start the paperwork. Thank you, sir. We're going to celebrate father's 80th birthday. So, please accept our invitation. There's no need for formalities, I'll come. - No.. I'll meet you in the evening. - Okay. Sister, distribute all these invitations. I'll take care of food. Please take care of temple arrangements. Why are you doing all this? First, try to solve your problem. It's all over, Sister. Within a month, the divorce will be finalised. I can't let that come in the way of Father's happiness. If not our parents, whom else can we do all this for? I can't imagine how they lived together for so long. Don't stress yourself. I'll take care of all the arrangements. Okay, Sister. - Okay. Bye. Bye, Paru. - Bye. Paru, come here. Distribute these invitations. Mom, can we invite dad too? Why? - It's a family function, right? Why should we invite someone who is leaving his family? Whatever it is, he my dad. Don't have the hope that we will get back together. Don't get upset, expecting something that would never happen. Let him attend his last family function with us. Okay, as you wish. Who will invite him? - I'll invite him. Paru! Come, dear. Come in. Come, sit down. How are you, dear? How is your college life? It's fine, Dad. Take this. What's it, dear? - It's grandfather's 80th birthday. I came to invite you. Did mom ask you to give this? No, I had to force her. I guessed as much. Okay, Dad. I'll leave, it's getting late. I just wanted to drop by, on my way. Paru.. - Yes? Your mother and I have unresolved issues. It just happened. Nothing can be done. I guess we weren't made for each other. But this shouldn't affect your life, alright? Okay. - What, dear? How will it not affect me, Dad? I want to see you both together. Bye, Dad. "Happy birthday to you!" "Happy birthday to you!" "Happy birthday, dear Arun!" Happy birthday, my man! Oh! I'm sorry. - Hey! He's my cousin, Ramakrishna. Oh, hi. - Happy birthday. I'm sorry. My hands are dirty. Just a moment, where is Vignesh? - Vignesh.. Why are you still upset? Forget it. I used to be upset, too. Everything will be okay. - Hey! This is just the first. You're going to face so many more rejections! Leave it. I have an idea, to forget her. Let's go on a trip, this weekend. Where will we go? - Let's go to Pondicherry. Hey! I know why you want to go there. There's no need for it. What do you mean? You just want to drink and have fun, don't you? Hey, let me explain. My friend, John, from Pondicherry, recently got engaged. We couldn't attend his engagement so, he invited Rama and me over, this weekend. I just thought I'd take you along, too. Hey, there's no need for this. If we're going, how'd that be? - That's my boy! Ramakrishna owns a car, let's go with him. Shall we go? Okay, let them come. He's fine with it, what's your problem? No, it won't work out. Hey! We are going and you're also coming. No, man.. - Hey! We are going. - Hey! Pondicherry! Yeah! I still don't think this is a good idea. Hey, don't be negative. We are going to change, after this trip. That's exactly why I am scared. I wonder what'll happen! Hey! - Pondicherry! We've reached. - Pondi.. We've reached Pondi. You can go in, I'll park the car and join you. Hi! - Hi, what's up? How are you? - I'm fine. This is Vignesh. - Hi. And this is Arun. - Hi. Congrats, dude. - Thanks, man. You must be tired, come on in. How dare you! - Hey! - Let me go! Leave him. - Brother, leave him. Why are you hitting him? - Leave him! No, sir, listen to me. - Come, Brother. - I'll kill him! I said, let me go! - Pull him. Push him inside the room. Open the door, open the door! I'll kill him! - Hey! Why did you invite him? He said that you invited him. Why would I invite him? - Why? What happened? Open the door! What are you talking about? - Yes. How would I know that? - What's going on, here? Dude, we need to tell them. It's no big deal. One year ago John stole Ramakrishna's girlfriend. - Hey! It's not like that. My fiancee, Cathy, is Ramakrishna's ex-girlfriend. - That's what I said, too. Hey! Why did you bring him here? I didn't know about all this. Hey! Only after their breakup, we got together. Yes, that's what's important, right now! What should I do now? Hey, he's become silent, suddenly. I'm getting scared. I'll talk to him. - What will you say? I said I'll talk to him, right? Brother! I just came to know about everything. I can understand your feelings. But they're going to be married, in a few days. We can't change that, can we? Why are you digging up the past, Brother? Do you know how much I loved Cathy? That's why I can't bear this! - Forget it! If not her, you still have so many girls, who'd fall for you! I couldn't control myself, that's why I hit him. It's alright. I can understand. Where is John? Come on! It's okay, just come. Sorry, I couldn't control myself. Sorry, guys.. I spoiled your mood too. Sorry.. - Brother, that's alright. We're going to enjoy this Pondicherry trip, okay? Smile, Brother! Come on, shake your hands with him. Shake hands, Brother. Give him a hug. The problem is solved. Hey, it's going to be fun from now! You need to tell him. - Me? No, Arun will tell him. - Hey! You said you'd talk to him, right? Go on! Brother, here's your coffee. - Thanks. What is the plan, now? That's what I wanted to talk to you about. Cathy has come from Chennai. She has invited her friends for lunch. She wants to introduce John to them. That's nice. When we are going? No, we're going, but you.. You're saying I shouldn't come, right? Don't mistake me, Brother. John has no objections. But we thought the girl might get embarrassed. I was the one who brought you here. Now, you're asking me to stay away, are you? We don't need you to stay away! We'll anyway be together after lunch! I'll even get alcohol, on my way back! I know.. I knew this would happen. I'll just go, drink somewhere and then, head back to Chennai. Whether I go back home alive or not who cares about me? - Why would you say that, Brother? It's okay, you can come. No, I'll go back. I'm telling you, you can come. Her friends don't know you. There won't be any problem. Come. Come, it's getting late. Get ready soon. It's time to go. - Let's go. This won't end well. Bother, are you leaving? No, I was just getting comfortable. When will your friends come? They'll be here any time, now. She must be somewhere over there, I guess. - I can't see. I don't know. Hi.. - Hi! Hi.. - Congrats dear.. Thanks. This is John. - Hello. - Hi! These are John's friends. Hello. - Hi. - Hi. This is Shivani, Swetha and Tanvi. Hi, please sit. Wow, did you select this? - Yes. You guys are so made for each other, don't you think? Yeah. Thank you. How'd you manage to get her? She's not an easy catch. What happened? - Nothing.. Forget them, how can we get you? What? I mean, say something about you. - Don't try too much. We already have boyfriends. You're saying it as if you're talking about puppies! It's the same thing, really. She's the only one who's happily single. That's not important, right now. What's the big deal? You're happy, fully free. You can flirt with anyone. But we have to control ourselves. Why does he keep laughing? - Nothing.. He watched a comedy movie in the morning he's just getting the comedy now. That's what he's laughing about. Am I right? Don't you have girlfriends? - No. I've always failed in love. - He recently failed in love. He was going just fine, but failed just now. Why? We broke up. Whose mistake was it? That's if you don't mind me asking. I don't know who's fault it is. It just didn't work out. Oh! I'm sorry. - It's okay. One coke. - One sweet lime juice. Go along, I'll get it for you. - It's okay. I'm sorry we had to bring Rama. It's okay. I knew I'd have to face this situation some day. It's true. So.. How's the preparation for your marriage going? It's going good. Don't take too long. I have an important client meeting. Hi, you're Parvathi, right? Yes. - I'm Arun's father. Hello, Uncle. - Hello, I've seen your photo on Facebook. Did you come for shopping? Yes, shopping.. Obviously. You'd come to a shop for shopping. How's your college life? A-Actually, it's going good. Arun's gone out of station, you'd know, right? - Yes.. Oh, God! Come, Parvathi's shopping here, too! - Hello.. Will you please come here? - Wait, I'll just speak to her. We'll talk later, just come. - Wait! - Excuse me, dear.. Excuse me.You can also buy something. - Just come. I was talking to her, why'd you drag me away? Look where you were! - What? Just look! Hello! - Hi. I'd only seen your photographs. We're really happy that you're both such 'friends'. You should always be such good 'friends'! Okay, ma'am. - Correct. During our college times, my wife and I were 'friends', too. He's our only son. We've spoilt him a little. But however spoilt he is he's always been responsible. He's a good boy. You'd already know that. How are your parents? - They are fine. What do your parents do? Mom works in the railways, dad.. He runs a business. What is your father's name? - Akilan. Akilan? - Yes. Oh! Do you know him? - No.. I thought I did, but I don't. Okay, dear, we'll leave, now. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Bye. I'd told you about the divorce case I'm dealing with, right? It's Parvathi's parents. Really? How can you say that? See, all the details are here. Oh! Please don't ask him anything. He'll tell us, if he wants to. - Okay.. Paru, just a minute. Carnegie Mellon, USA. You got selected. - Oh! They've sent a call letter for a video conference. If you clear this, you could get a scholarship, right? Yes. I told you you'd get it! They've asked you to reply to the email ID in this mail. You will accept it, won't you? - Yes. You'll come for the catamaran ride, won't you? Hey, I'm not coming! I'm not used to it. Do you get sea sick? - Yes. The sea sickness is pretty bad. I'm not coming. Then I won't come, either. - Me neither. Hey, why are you scaring everyone? - Hey.. If you don't want to go, it's fine. I'll stay too. No.. You can go, I have two people for company. Are you sure? - Yeah.. Have fun. Be careful. - Okay, bye. How many times should I have to call you? Won't you pick up? She's on the phone, she won't stop anytime soon. Do you want to get something to drink? - Sure. Come on. - You can't just not call. Arun, I want to tell you something. What? - Okay, I'll be straightforward. One of my friends is really interested in you. Is it Shivani? It's that obvious, isn't it? - Yes. Okay, so.. So.. - What do you say? No, tell her I said no. I'm not ready for another relationship, right now. Come on. Don't think about the past. You have to move on, now. Breaking up with Rama was hard for me too. But if I hadn't gotten over it, I wouldn't have found John. If you don't mind can I know why you broke up with Rama? Rama is very possessive. Even if anybody comes and speaks to me casually he'd ask why he spoke to me. He'd behave like a psycho. After a point, I couldn't handle it. See, at least you have a reason for your breakup. But in my case I still don't know what the reason is. Although, from the relationship I learnt how to fail in love I still haven't found a solution to it. How can I fall in love again, at this stage? What really happened, that made you breakup? Why do you want to know now? - There's enough time, isn't there? Maybe I can be the third person to solve your problem. I'd rather have gone with them and drowned in the sea. Hey, just tell me. - Okay.. The first problem.. Yes! I'd promised to take her shopping, one weekend. But a frisbee tournament that was supposed to be a month later got rescheduled to the next week. So, my friends asked me to go for practice, that weekend. When I told her about it.. What? Are you kidding? I'd put away all my other plans, just to go shopping with you! What other plans did you put away? Whatever! I didn't plan anything else, did I? That day, I too, had bought tickets for the movie but you said you had to rewrite your record and cancelled the plan! Did I make a scene? Record writing and frisbee practice aren't the same thing! It's just a group of friends playing, right? What'll happen if you miss a day? You don't play for India, do you? Why are you fighting now? Don't interfere, sir. It is important to me. I want to practice and play well in the match, next week. Even though I'm not playing for India, it's important to me. Are you coming or not? I'm not. You can't control my life, Paru. You too can't control my life. You don't have a life! That's the problem. You don't have anything to do, that's why you're troubling me! Sorry, dear. That was a mistake. Maybe you're right. Really, I don't have a life. That's not true, Paru. Yes, I don't have any work, do I? Who said so? It's not like that. - You said so. I'm dumb. I blabber such stuff. Don't mind that. So, you're coming shopping with me, right? Yes! See.. She started the fight she made me say I made a mistake she made me call myself dumb and she even took me shopping. All she did, was one thing. If they can't be clear and solve an issue logically girls will use their secret weapon. Once the dam is broken, what can we do? So, I had no choice, I'd to go shopping. Is this good? Yes. This one? - I don't know, dear. Did I force you to come? We're here, now. It doesn't matter. I don't want to shop like this. - Hey.. Hi! How are you? - Hi, how are you! It's been long! You look different. What brings you here? This is Arun. This is Rupesh, my friend from school. Hi. - Hi, do you know Malayalam? No. - By the way, I heard you were going to do MS. What happened to that? - I thought I'd go abroad, but changed my mind. But why? Doing it abroad has more value. Yes, but I've lost interest. Now, I'll just work here for a while, and go later. Okay, do that. - What brings you to Chennai? Do you know Malayalam? Yes, I can manage to speak. Who is he? I told you, he is my friend from school. He calls, sometimes, texts often. Actually, he proposed to me in 12th standard. What? It was just an infatuation. I was very clear, I said no. Why didn't you tell me earlier? It never came up. I thought, then how many more characters in her life did I not know about? Hold this. I'll just be back. I need to use the restroom. I saw many males names in her contacts, whom I didn't know. Checking her phone in her absence.. I felt really bad. The fact that I doubted her, was in itself, very disturbing. Why didn't you just ask her? That was my problem. I was scared that I might hurt her by asking such questions. I'd think so much about how to ask her. Finally, did you ask her or not? I wanted to but before that.. Why are there so many girls in your Facebook friend list? Are there? - Yes, who's this girl? She's uploaded a childhood photo of yours. There are so many comments! 'So sweet.. So cute.' Who are these people that I don't know? That's my grandmother. - What? The childhood photo was uploaded by my grandmother. Is your grandmother on Facebook? My entire family is on Facebook. Don't lie. Is it your grandmother, who's profile picture is Tamanna's photo? Is it Tamanna? Last week, it was Trisha's photo. Why does your grandmother have Tamanna's photo? When college girls upload photos of actresses why can't my grandmother do the same? I'm on Facebook only because Shiva forced me to be. I don't even use it much. Don't worry unnecessarily, okay? Okay, bye. - Bye. This is what happened, always. When I'm thinking of confronting her with a problem She'd bring up the problem to me, the very next day. Yes girls never keep anything to themselves. Whatever it is, they'll immediately talk about it. Before the guy even finishes thinking about it the girl would've thought about it and even spoken about it. Okay. You're right. Is it my fault that I didn't want to hurt her by talking about it? Or is it her fault that she spoke about it openly? You're confused, right? This is the problem. This is the basic difference between boys and girls. That too, if two women discuss something together the level of confusion is much worse. What happened to you? - Nothing. Then why are you irritated? What was my fault? The problem is between you two, right? I met dad on my way. Oh! What did he say? He doesn't want to miss me, because of your issues. Even now, he doesn't feel like coming back. How big is this rift between you two? Can't you talk it out? If we'd talked it out earlier, it would've made sense. But this man just can't talk about anything, can he? He simply sits and reads the paper or watches TV. If I try to talk to him, he'll say there's nothing to talk about. Much later, you'd come to know that there's been an issue. By the time you figure it out the issue would be much bigger. And would lead to a fight. There's no point in not talking. Girls don't understand something. Boys can be idle for almost half an hour, without thinking or doing anything. Really? What are you thinking about? - Nothing. Nothing? - Nothing. How can you be, without thinking anything? Why girls don't understand this is because they're always thinking about something or the other. The interior of this cafe is quite nice. Is that couple happy or not? That girl has beautiful hair. I need to do something too. I don't know how much I'll have to spend in a hair spa. How can be, without thinking anything? Why would I lie to you? I'm honestly not thinking about anything. You don't share anything with me. Don't I share every thought with you? But I really don't have anything on my mind! Why would you not tell me? That's when boys make a mistake. They'll just blurt something out and get into trouble. Actually, there is something. I saw so many guys' numbers on your phone. Who are they? Why didn't you tell me about them? Did you check my phone? No, I didn't check anything. I was just casually looking through. - Do you suspect me? It's not like that. I'm giving you so much freedom, right? You're giving me freedom, are you? Paru! Paru! There's a question that girls ask, after they get into a relationship. Have you ever lied to me? Not big ones, just very small lies like lying about why I'm late. Can you promise me something? You must always be truthful to me. You shouldn't even say a small lie. Okay? Okay, I'll never lie to you, again. Hey! How does this top look? It's ugly. Girls ask boys, not to lie. But if they don't like the truth they get more pissed. It's not necessary to say the truth whenever a girl asks something. Just tell them whatever they expect to hear. How would you know what we expect to hear? That's exactly what we've been trying to guess, all our lives! If I knew that, why would I have suffered a breakup? Then, how did you solve this problem? Until then, we'd never discussed our issues with our friends. We'd talk it out between us. But for the first time we planned to speak to a mature third person, to sort it out. Who did you call? There are issues in your relationship because you keep misunderstanding each other. Now, I'm here. You can talk, only when I ask you to. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay, now what is the problem? He doubts me. - I don't doubt you.. I asked her. You can continue. How did you feel, when he suspected you? I know you'd have been angry. If you're angry, don't keep it to yourself. Vent it out. She didn't get angry at all. - Keep quiet. Don't interrupt. She's talking, isn't she? Yes, I felt very hurt. - I understand. When he, who knows me the most, suspected me I felt lost. What's your answer for these tears, Arun? - Hello! I didn't cry at all. I asked him. - Hey! I didn't suspect her at all. I just asked her why I didn't know about her male friends until then. Why didn't I know she was in touch with someone who'd proposed to her? Yes, why you didn't tell him? You'd added so many girls on Facebook! Why didn't you tell me that? - See! You're doubting me too! With your relationship status as single and 300 girls on your friend list anyone would think that you'd like to date with them. I don't even know how Facebook works. This idiot forced me have an account. - Hey! Don't tell me I shouldn't have done that! If I hadn't made him join Facebook would you have known that he's trying other girls? Hey! She just suspected me. But you're talking as if I really flirted with other girls! The issue is not me, doubting him, it's about him doubting me. Yes, don't change the topic. Just because I'm friendly with a boy who proposed to me How can he think that I have been going around with other boys? Good question! How did you find out she was going out with other guys? Excuse me! What do you mean? I didn't go out with anyone else! But he thinks so! - Hey! I never thought so! You did! - I didn't! - Shut up! No one speak, finger on the lips! - What? Okay, forget everything. Whatever happened, happened. Arun, promise me something. Even if she speaks to guys who proposed to her promise me that you won't check her phone or doubt her. Ok, I will not doubt her. Ok, Paru, promise me something. Even if he checks your phone or opens a page on Facebook without telling you or even if he doubts you promise me that you won't go out with other guys! Hey! Since that didn't work out, we talked it out by ourselves. After that, we were together, but not like before. Hey, why have you been so dull, lately? It's nothing. It's Arun. He's not how he used to be. Nowadays, we don't go out at all. We only go twice a week. She always wants to go out. At least twice a week, she needs to go somewhere. She doesn't understand how I miss frisbee practice for her. He thinks, missing frisbee practice is a big deal! Moreover, he doesn't listen to me when I talk. I don't even feel like listening to her talk, these days. What does he think, when I'm speaking? Whenever she talks I feel like there's some hard folk song playing in my head! Alas! I knew this problem would keep growing and end up as a disaster and it happened. Hey, Arun! Paru is calling. Keep it on silent, I'll talk to her later. Hello. - Do you know how long I've been trying to call you? Did you ignore my calls, intentionally? Hey! - What if something had happened to me? Would you have ignored even then? Hey, why are you shouting like a mad woman? Yes, I am mad, for having trusted you. Hey, Paru, you.. Hello.. What's that sound? Nothing, Mother! Paru! Paru, one minute! Don't talk to me, I don't need this! - One minute.. I get hurt, because I expect things from you. I won't expect anything, anymore. I told you I was going for practice. Do whatever you want, I don't care! Even I do not care anymore. All this drama is because I respect you and give you importance, right? No, Arun, if you'd respected me, there wouldn't have been a problem. You'll know my importance only if you miss me. You don't know how miserable you'd be, without me. I'd definitely be better off, than how I am, now! The dam had broken again. But, this time, it seemed to have broken permanently. Tell me, who's fault could this be? All we did was, I behaved like a guy and she behaved like a girl, it didn't end well. What? I'm thinking, why did she suddenly behave like that? She got angry because I didn't pick up her calls. Are you sure it's just that? What if there was something else? Who would know? - Did you never ask her? I didn't get a chance to. Ask now. Call now and ask. Are you kidding? Come on, don't you ever want to know the reason for your breakup? No way! Are you kidding? I can't! Please, just for me. She won't pick my calls up! You can try. 'Arun calling'! See, I told you she wouldn't pick up. Ok, try from my phone. You don't intend to just let me go, do you? Hello! Hello! Tell me, Arun. How is life? Am good, Grandfather's 80th birthday is coming up. We're preparing for the function. How are you? I'm good. I have come to Pondicherry, for a friend's engagement. A small get-together. Actually, I called you for a reason. When we fought and broke up, that day Why were you so angry with me? I mean, was there some problem I didn't know about? Did you call to ask that? What's the point of crying over spilt milk? I don't know if there's any point. I should at least know the reason. What do you want to know? Why did you call me, so many times, that day? Okay, When I came back from college that day my mother was talking to a lawyer. Okay, ma'am, I will send the documents. All right. - I'll take your leave. Bye. - Okay. Why did he come? - I have applied for divorce. People who'd loaned money to your father have been coming to me. They don't believe that we are separated. They think that we are cheating them. So, if we get divorced there won't be such issues. This would've happened, some day or the other. Why should we prolong something that has no.. Will both of you never let me know what you want to do? Please listen to me. - Or do you just not remember me? You are taking such a big decision, why can't you ask me? I am also a part of this family. Paru.. Hello. - Do you know how long I've been trying to call you? Did you ignore my calls, intentionally? What if something had happened to me? Would you have ignored.. Hey, why are you shouting like a mad woman? - Yes, I'm mad! For having trusted you! 'The number you are trying to reach' 'is currently switched off, please..' I'm so sorry! I thought you were angry only because I didn't pick up your call. I'm really sorry. I didn't have any idea. It's okay, Arun. No.. It would've been so hard for you. I can't even imagine. - It's okay. You realized your mistake at least now. That's enough. What? - What? My mistake? I just felt sorry for your suffering. What was my fault? - Did you not hear what I said? I did, but you never told me all this, that day! You didn't let me, Arun! I called you so many times! I told you that I was going for practice. After seeing so many calls why didn't you realize it was something important? What's the big deal in picking up a call during practice? Alright, but when I finally called you, why didn't you tell me? Why did you shout at me and cut the call? Oh, so are you saying that it was my fault? If you'd just told me the issue, the fight wouldn't have happened. Why didn't you call me back? I had done nothing wrong, and you shouted at me! Even I got angry! I'm also a human being. If I'm mad, why did you call me? I called you by mistake. The biggest mistake I've made. I'll never call again! Hello, I wasn't craving for you to call me, okay? Oh! Are you going to cry, now? Please don't! I'll cut the call. - Why should you cut the call? I'll cut the call. Hey, hello.. Hello.. Hey! That's my phone! Paru, shall we go? - Yes, I'm coming. I forgot why we even started fighting! I want to talk to her now. If I call, she'll shout at me now. Why is this happening? I told you not to call her, right? I was fine, without talking to her. I was away from her. Why did you start again? I'm so sorry. I just wanted to help you. What will you do? It's okay. I tried to forget her. That's the most difficult thing I've ever done. I'm still trying. Everything will be okay. Look. Cathy and Arun have become thick friends. Cathy has always been very friendly with everyone. You can ask John. Hey, why can't you join us? - No, I quit. Did you quit drinking? Why? Just like that. It's a good thing. Oh! I understood. Your lady would have asked you to quit. Yes, I told her I wouldn't drink. Okay, don't drink, starting tomorrow. Come on, now. Hey.. I don't want to. - Come, I won't tell ma'am! Hey, I can understand. You have told her.. That is why you are not drinking. I'm only asking you to have one glass. Just one glass. This is the last drink I'll have with you. No.. He said no, just leave it. Won't you even do this, for me? Cheers.. - Cheers.. Happy married life, John. - Thank you. Hey.. What does he have, that I lack? He's useless. Unworthy.. You're the best, Brother. Hey, little John.. After a breakup, Give some time for patch up. Don't just barge in, immediately! Am I not handsome? - You look like the actor, Ajith! - Hey! Why are you bringing him into the equation? Am I not better looking than him? Brother, you look handsome. Instead of choosing him, She could've chosen me. Sorry, Brother. I meant you. Intoxication brings out the truth. Okay, let's go to sleep. Hey, wait! I want to ask him something. Hey.. She left me and came with you. How can you be sure that she won't leave you for someone else? Hey! Tell him not to talk. Hey, don't talk. What? I speak the truth. Tomorrow, there might be someone, younger and better looking than you Someone, probably even Arun! I mean Arun and Cathy were having so much fun on the beach. What if, tomorrow, they fell in love? What will you do? I'm going to sleep. - Hey! Come here. Come, come here. Come and sit. Come.. Are you trying something? She's like a sister to me! 'Like a sister'.. So, she isn't exactly your sister. What were you talking about, on the beach? Something about love. Oh, God! It was about my old love. About my breakup. Are you creating sympathy? You were telling her your old, sad stories and she was consoling you, right? - Gosh, please let it go. I'm already in trouble. Hey.. Did she not flirt with you? - Hey! Don't talk ill about her! - Oh! He's getting angry when I speak about her! I have been cheated! Whatever you said is happening for real! Don't cry, my friend! All girls are like this! Yes! I've decided.. Breakup! Break up! Call her now! Call her, man. Oh no, don't call. Just do it! - No, don't! Do it! - Where's my phone? Please don't.. - Hey, shut up! Don't call her, please.. - Hey! Wait. Hello, Cathy. Tell me. What were you and Arun talking about, on the beach? What are you blabbering? Were you talking about love? Are you drunk? - What did you talk about? Are you drunk? - Did you flirt with Arun? Hello. Hello? Hello? She cut the call. What you said is true! - Oh, God! All girls are like this! Yes, don't cry.. We shouldn't let girls do this to us, anymore! Yes. I betrayed you! Leave it. It's ok.. This is all because of him. Yes, but don't hit him! Hey.. - Hey! She should've just come to me! Good evening, sir. - Good evening. Basic paperwork and formalities are over. What's left is the court hearing. Thank you very much, sir. Did you speak with her? No, sir. I tried a couple of times. I couldn't take it. Oh. My daughter invited me for my father-in-law's 80th birthday. That too, against her mother's wish. She invited me on her own. Your marriage was a love marriage, right? - Yes, sir. Do you still love her? Don't take any decision until you know an answer to this question. Don't let her decide, either. You faced your family and the world, back then. What is this, sir? These are just papers! I say this to all my clients, at this stage. I'm telling you the same. If you still want divorce, I will help you. The choice is yours. Come on, Dad. How are you, dear? - I'm fine, Dad. Come, please sit here. Paru, where is your mother? She must be somewhere here. Sit down, Dad, I will be back. Couples who live together forever are they really made for each other? Don't they ever face any problems? They say, big problems have small solutions. Maybe it applies for love too. "The cold wind blows, like a poem being sung.." "Sometimes my fingers twitch, and my body feels ticklish.." "This young girl is not a girl. She is a flower garden.." "Play the orchestra. Here is a love procession.." "The cold wind blows, like a poem being sung.." "Sometimes my fingers twitch, and my body feels ticklish.." How was your trip? It was good. - Where did you go? Dear.. Don't ask anything. Okay, prepare the breakfast. What's up? How was the beach? - Like a beach. That Parvathi.. Your 'friend', Parvathi. Have their parents applied for divorce? Why do you ask? Because I'm handling that case. You know it, then. Why are you asking me? But she is your friend, right? We're not that close. She's in another department. What? Did you fight? I told you. She is not a close friend of mine. I just came, you have already started questioning me. Hey, have one more dosa! No, I'm not hungry. Paru.. What are you doing here, Dad? I came to meet you. Ok, tell me. How are you? I'm fine. How is your studies coming along? I'm doing well. Mother.. How is she? Mother.. She is fine. That day.. That day, after the function did your mom ask you about me? She asked whether you had lunch or not. Dad, it's getting late.. - Paru! One minute. Give this letter to your mother. Don't forget to give it. Tell her I gave it. 'To my dear..' 'Yesterday, when I saw you in temple' 'I felt younger by 20 years.' 'I felt like I'd discovered' 'the love I'd lost, long ago.' 'I felt terrible that, with a princess of a woman for a wife' 'I couldn't keep her happy.' 'When I left home, that day' 'I was so blind that I didn't even think of our daughter.' 'But now, I have changed, Saro.' 'As a lover, As a father' 'as the head of a family.' 'I'm ready to accept all the responsibilities.' 'Until I breathe my last' 'I won't leave you alone.' 'I'll tell you the rest when we meet, Saro.' 'I want to meet you again.' 'Now, after so long' 'I'm going to give you something.' 'Don't be angry that it's through a letter..' What has he written, Mom? Nothing important. Just a general letter. Shall I get you something to eat? Everything's gone haywire. Since I spoke to her on phone, that day I've started talking to myself, like I used to. The happenings around me, make me ask just one question. Why is love so difficult? Take Vignesh.. He loved sincerely. He still does. When I told him she rejected him.. But she never said she didn't like me, right? - What can I say? Take Rashmi.. She must hate all men, by now. You all gain trust, and then deceive us! All guys are like this! Our senior! He is still changing girlfriends, every week. Who is it now? Shwetha? That was last week. This is Sruthi. My name is Deepa. Deepa. Okay, it won't last long. Our Shiva, he doesn't need description. He is still the same. Of all the people I know, I think only Cathy's John's love is solid. Buddy, there's a problem! What happened? - Cathy and John have broken up! What? - Yes. She dropped the marriage. John is on his way here, from Pondicherry. After he said all that, in his drunken state there was a big fight. We didn't speak properly, for a few days. Yesterday I called him and cancelled our marriage. He is coming to Chennai, now. What is this? You too? John isn't at fault. At first, he refused to drink. But this Shiva and Rama forced him to drink. Rama confused him, and made him drink. So, what, Arun? He had decided not to do that. But he did. What does that mean? Do you know how he spoke? It felt like I was back with Rama! After breaking up with Rama, I was just like you. I lost hope. I didn't want love, anymore! John came and changed everything. But now, when he did this like you said, I think living without love, is the right way. Gosh! I'm a big failure! Why'd you listen to me? Breaking up with John and Rama are not the same. It's very difficult to find someone who's suitable for us. It's sheer stupidity to throw such a person away. Even I did the same mistake. Only I know, how difficult it is, now. At least you have another chance. Please don't make the same mistake. Please.. All your rice, salt and oil intake is cut from tomorrow! Alas! If you stop all that, I'll starve! If you want to reduce your belly, you need to cut all that. You, becoming fat, is easier than that. Oh, no! Paru! Come, dear. When did you come, Dad? I came in the morning. Ok, get ready. Ok, I'll go and freshen up. Paru! I've prepared dinner for you. They gave me two tickets for an evening movie show, at office. Is it okay If we both go for it? Wow! Are you planning to leave me alone? Hey, they only gave me two tickets. If you do not approve, we won't go for it. Alright, go for it. By the way what happened to the divorce papers? I tore them. Really? - Yes. My dear! Sir, are you going on a date? Oh, no! How did you change her mind? I got a job at LIC as the zonal manager. Life is settled. There is no need to fear anything. What about your business plans? Everything has it's own time. Now is not the time for business. I've always done things in a hurry. My mind is clearing up, only now. Business can be started any time. It's always there. But She can't be gotten back, every time. Neither can you. Suddenly, you've become made for each other, have you? In this world, no one is made for each other. We must make ourselves made for each other with the person we love. I haven't told her about this job. Tonight, I'm going to surprise her. Then how did she accept? - She trusted me. She trusted and accepted me. I decided that I love her enough to change myself for her. And she decided to love me, for whatever I am. Now, she and I are made for each other.

I've almost got a seat in Carnegie Mellon University. Oh, congrats! Just like you wanted! A few days ago I met your parents in a mall. Did you? They came and spoke to me. What did they say? - They spoke very well. They were very sweet. They kept saying we should always be 'friends'. At first, I didn't get it. I realized it only later. That was the day you called me. Then.. I met your mom, yesterday. She was so worried. She said you're very disturbed. Are you still worried about our breakup? No, nothing like that. My mom is always like that. She'll always worry about something. When she asked me I felt very guilty. I'm also a reason for this. No.. You don't need to worry about this. Please.. - No, Arun. You.. Even though you accepted our breakup You would have missed me, right? That'd be so painful, right? No, I didn't feel anything like that. Didn't you feel anything? No, nothing, Paru. Worrying about something that's over won't let us advance in life. You have to go to the U.S I've to settle in a good job. There are many responsibilities in life, right? So, you don't feel anything about me or the breakup, do you? No, Paru. - What? You loved me for one year. Do you not feel anything? Paru.. - Are you a statue? Paru.. - I hate you, Arun! I hate you! Listen to me! Paru.. Why am I always making her angry? That second, I decided certain things. How many ever times I'm reborn I can never understand girls completely. We have to accept this. Only then, can we love a girl. More importantly I decided not to get hurt on my head, anymore. I hate you! Paru.. Hey! - Hey! What are you doing? - Shut up! Paru, open the door. Paru, open the door. Please listen to me. What is this? Go, open the door. No, I can't. - I'm going to open.. Don't open the door! Please listen to me.. Paru, I was kidding! Open the door Paru, please listen to me. Paru.. Open the door, Paru! - Paru please open the door.. Hey, shut up! Paru.. I won't lose you again. You left me once and it was cruel! What I told you in canteen, was a lie. I said so, because I didn't want to hurt you. I can't live without thinking of you. I couldn't deal with your absence. Paru.. I can forget you only if I decide to. But I don't feel like forgetting you! I have everything in life. But your absence makes me feel like I'm nothing, Paru. We have fought a lot. We have made so many mistakes. This love.. I just don't know why love is so difficult! Maybe.. Love is learnt by making errors, constantly. Sometimes, we become crazy. But it is all because you and I are mad about each other. Wow! What a line! Thanks, buddy. Paru.. I've promised you that I'll never leave you alone. I won't break that promise. From now whether you hit me or kick me or even chase me away I'll always be with you. I love you, Paru.. I love you, Paru.. Paru, I love you.. - Hey, be careful.. I love you, Paru. Why did it take so long for you to say this? There's no one who doesn't err in love. If you haven't erred, you're not in love, yet. Go, make mistakes. What are you doing? Do you know how long I've been waiting for you? A movie, my dear.. Is the movie more important than me? It's not that, dear.. Then what am I doing, here? - Don't shout.. What do you think? - Cut it! I've been watching you.. - No, dear.. Cut it!
