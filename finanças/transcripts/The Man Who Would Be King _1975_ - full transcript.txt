Subtitles by explosiveskull NARRATOR: A long time ago, Britain was ruled by King Uther Pendragon. But when Uther died without an heir, the land was torn apart by war. Many tried to claim the throne and fought bitterly and endlessly. People's hearts grew hopeless and hollow. The country became lost and leaderless. So the wizard Merlin conjured a magical sword in a stone called Excalibur and declared that only Uther's true heir could pull it free. Many tried, but only one succeeded. A boy named Arthur, who had no idea he was Uther's long-lost son. Arthur grew into a great king. He turned his enemies into allies and ruled at a round table, so that all were equal. He and his knights lived by a code of chivalry, their hearts pure and noble. But their greatest foe was Arthur's own half-sister, Morgana. Convinced she was the rightful heir, and desperate to possess Excalibur, she turned to dark sorcery. Arthur fought a fearsome battle against her, and bound her into the bowels of the earth. But not before she swore dark vengeance. When you are long gone, when hearts are hollow and the land is lost and leaderless again, I will return. NARRATOR: And so will the sword. MUM: Alex, you're gonna be late. ALEX: Okay, okay! I'm coming as fast as I can. MUM: Your homework's all over the kitchen table. (INDISTINCT CHATTER OVER RADIO) You know, every time you sleep in and skip breakfast, it's like... BOTH: ...starting the day on an empty battery. I know. MUM: Maybe if you hadn't left that till last thing the night before... ALEX: Damn. MUM: Here. It's not exactly the right color, but... (BLOWS) Maybe you can say it's a solar flare. Thanks, Mum. MAN: (ON RADIO) You're listening to the BBC. It's 7:30am, it's time for the news. (PANTING) WOMAN: (ON RADIO) BBC News at 7:30. Experts are warning that the world is becoming more unstable than it has been for centuries. With dictators and strongmen gaining power in more countries than ever before, global divisions are increasing at an alarming rate. (PHONE CHIMES) (KIDS SHOUTING) ALEX: Oh, no. Excuse me.

Alexander Elliot! PRINCIPAL: I'll give you one last chance, or I'll just have to give all three of you detention. Who started it? No one. Your behavior here directly affects the rest of your life. You know that, don't you? It's a tough world out there and it's getting tougher all the time. There's millions of kids in this country with a better start in life than you. And the world is not going to change. It's you that has to change. Alex, you saved my life, and now I owe you my undying loyalty. Like Frodo and Samwise or Chewbacca and Han or Donkey and Shrek. We'll make sure we're on the same bus every morning. And I'll wait for you at lunch break and after school, so if they ever dare try anything... We already do that, Bedders. Lance and Kaye rule the school. There's nothing you can do. There's nothing either of us can do. This isn't junior school anymore. We're nothings now. We're the most insignificant, powerless people in the school. Hey. Hey! I learnt a new trick. Hold out your hand. (SIGHS) Now squeeze as hard as you can. Abracadabra! Alakazam! Open your hand. Wait, that's not right. You're supposed to have both of them. It's a duplication illusion. It's really good when it works. (COINS CLINK) Don't worry about it, Bedders. I'm not in the mood for magic anymore. MUM: Alex, are you okay? It's not true, is it? What would make you jump on someone and start punching them? Alex. ALEX: They were bullying Bedders. I tried to stop them. No one said anything about that. Why didn't you say something? Why didn't you tell someone? (GASPS) Alex, look at you. Because it would just make everything worse. How could telling the truth make everything worse? You wouldn't understand. Dad would understand. MUM: Well... he's not here. But if he was, I know exactly what he'd say. He'd say that telling the truth and doing the right thing never makes anything worse. You always used to believe that, Alex. Yeah. Well, not anymore.

A social experiment. Maybe there were hidden cameras. Look. There's something written on the guard. Put it into Google Translate. "Gladius... Arturi... filius Tintageli." (PHONE KEYBOARD CLICKING) It's Latin. It means, "Sword of Arthur, son of Tinta-gel." Who's Tinta-gel? What are you doing? ALEX: My dad gave me a book once, years ago... about the Knights of the Round Table. I used to know it off by heart. It's not "Tinta-gel," it's Tintagel. And Tintagel's not a person, it's a place... an island off the coast of Cornwall. There's an old ruined castle there. Some people say it's where King Arthur was born. I went there once when I was five. It's where my dad lived. The last time I ever saw him. That's where I was when he gave me this book. He even signed it. Look. BEDDERS: "To Alex, my once and future king. Dad." Alex, what if this is a message? What if you're the only person who could have pulled that sword out? What if it's... - Go on. - But you'll laugh at me. I won't, I promise. What if it's the Sword in the Stone? (BOTH LAUGH) Behold, Excalibur. Kneel before your king. Yes, my lord. You're my closest and oldest and very best friend. I knight thee... Sir Beddersvere. MUM: Alex, is your light still on? - You better be in bed. - ALEX: Quick, go. - BEDDERS: Alex. - What? You don't really think that's the real Sword in the Stone, do you? Of course not. - (BUZZING) - (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) - (BELL RINGS) - MAN: Morning. Bloody hell. Oh. Forgive me.

In that case, I require your smock. (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) (HORNS BLARING) (SIREN WAILING) BOY: Surely, Officers, it's not against the law to take a morning constitutional. Or to wear loose-fitting garments that permit fresh air to circulate around one's crevices and furrows. Now, your carriage seems warm and dry. Take me east at once, posthaste. (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) (SIREN WAILING) (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) - (SNEEZES) - (POPPING) DISPATCHER: (ON RADIO) Romeo Charlie zero one, what is your location? What just happened? (BIRD TWITTERS) TEACHER: Pay attention, everybody. We have a new pupil joining the class today. Why don't you introduce yourself? Greetings, young academicians. My name is... Mertin. Yes, that's right. Mertin Ambrosius Caledonensis. And I am a perfectly normal contemporary British schoolboy. (STUDENTS LAUGH) TEACHER: Quiet down, please. No, Bedders. Absolutely not. We cannot talk to that boy. But he looks cool. At the very least I bet he's into magic, and role-playing games, and Game of Thrones. Listen to me. For the first time ever, there's someone in this school who's more bullyable than us. We have to stay away from him. As far away as possible. TEACHER: Some metals are common, like copper, and are called base metals. Others are rare and valuable, like gold, and are called precious metals. Now, a long time ago, people called "alchemists" believed that you could change base metals to precious metals. These sections of the Earth's crust contain a wealth of history. Ruins, dead bodies, evidence of past civilizations. TEACHER: And slowly move your moons across, between the two. You will start to see how these two planets, when their orbits intersect, will cause the upcoming total solar eclipse. "Upcoming"? What do you mean, "upcoming"? When exactly is this total solar eclipse due? - Four days' time. - Four days? God's socks. This is a catastrophe. A disaster. I thought it was four years. Get out of my way! I need air, space to think! (STUDENTS CHATTERING) (DOOR CLOSES) Alexander Elliot! It was you who drew the sword. In four moons there will be darkness in daylight, the dual realms will be bridged, and Morgana will return. Oh, no. You must saddle your steeds, gird up your armor, gather your allies! Go away. We don't know you, and we don't want to know you. Leave us alone! (STUDENTS GASPING) Good people, this realm faces mortal danger! And this boy among you drew Excalibur. Who will kneel at his feet and swear allegiance? (STUDENTS LAUGHING, SHOUTING) Stop it! Stop that! (SCREAMS) - (BIRD TWITTERS) - (STUDENTS SCREAM) - (WINGS FLAPPING) - (STUDENTS YELLING) But Rokas saw it with his own eyes. Danielle said they tried to catch it for two hours, but it escaped. He did not turn into an owl, Bedders. But he said we're in mortal danger. And he knew about the sword. How could he know about the sword? I don't know. It's a coincidence. It doesn't matter, I've made up my mind. I'm putting it back. Tomorrow night, after school. It's stolen property, and it's a weapon. And it's making everything go... weird. - But what if... - But what if what? Nothing. Good night, Bedders.

Hurry. - (MERTIN SNEEZES) - (TWITTERING) DEMONIC VOICE: He was a child, my Lady. ECHOING VOICES: A child, a child. DEMONIC VOICE: A boy. No more than 12 winters. There was another. Hardly older than the chosen king. He destroyed our sentinel with an elemental manipulation. MORGANA: Merlin. A child too. Have I waited so long? DEMONIC VOICES: So long. Have I grown so old... that he has grown so young? (CREAKING) (GRUNTS) Awake, my warriors, cease your slumber. Nightfall will be ours. Awake, my warriors, cease your slumber. Nightfall will be ours. Awake, my warriors, cease your slumber. Nightfall will be ours. Awake, my warriors, cease your slumber. Nightfall will be ours. DEMONIC VOICES: Nightfall will be ours. Nightfall will be ours. Nightfall will be ours. Come on, Alex. It's time to join the land of the living. That is not Excalibur. Tell me the truth. Where did you get that thing? I told you, on a building site. Then we're taking it back there. Right now. No. You can't take it away. And you can't keep it. Alex, it's a dangerous weapon, and it doesn't belong to you. Yes, it does. I pulled it out of a stone and something came and tried to take it back. Something old and evil that came out of the ground. And a boy from school came and he saved me. And then he turned into an owl. And I was wide awake the whole time, I promise. Did you get that out of the attic? Alex, I know you're having a tough time. And I know you miss your dad. But he gave you that book because he wanted you to grow up to be a good person. Not the kind of person who gets into fights, not the kind of person who believes in fairy tales, and not the kind of person who carries... giant, medieval weapons around. Then why did he write this? Because he loved you. Then why did he leave? MUM: Maybe I haven't told you as much as I should about him. He had his battles. His demons. But he loved you. And this has to stop. Now, we're taking that sword to the police station and then I'm taking you to school. - Alex! - (GASPS) Put that down. Now. No. It's mine. - I need it. - I'm not telling you again. I have to go, and I'm taking it with me. Alexander Elliot, don't you dare leave this house. (GASPS) Alex. Sorry, Mum. Alex! Alex! BEDDERS: I feel sick, Alex. I've never been outside school on a weekday in term time before. Not without adult supervision and a hi-vis vest. It's just, I'm used to reading about this kind of thing. I'm not used to it actually happening. ALEX: Just calm down, Bedders. Let me do the talking. ("THE LAND OF MAKE BELIEVE" BY BUCKS FIZZ PLAYS) (SIZZLING) Ah! Finally. Take these, follow me. Come! I've taken temporary lodging above. As I tried to explain last night, appearing in the mortal realm after dark drains my life force extremely fast, let alone contending with a Mortes Milles. It takes a very particular potion to restore my strength. Beetle blood, ground bone and beaver urine. I thought I'd have trouble finding the ingredients, but Lip Smackin' Chicken had it all. Really? The red in this cherryade derives from beetle blood. The vanilla in this ice cream, from beaver urine. And these nuggets are largely gristle and ground animal bone. Altogether... mm... utterly invigorating. (MUNCHING) Mm. (SLURPS) Your name isn't Mertin, is it? It's Merlin. An ingenious alias, don't you think? Came up with it on the spur of the moment in order to monitor you incognito. (SLURPS) I thought Merlin was supposed to be an old man. You look about 16. That's because I live backwards in time. The older I grow, the younger I become. Honestly, boy, do they teach you nothing in that so-called school? From now on, nighttime will be dangerous for you too, Alexander. At night the penumbra between light and dark weakens. The Mortes Milles will rise again. Mortes Milles? Is that what came to get me last night? Fallen warriors from battles of old. Their souls enslaved by evil. For now, they can only enter this realm after dark. But... when they rise, time freezes and every mortal soul disappears, save for the one who drew the sword and those who have been knighted. Their spell is only broken at sunrise. Or when every risen warrior... is destroyed. That's why my mum disappeared. That's why everything went back to normal after you left. There are three moons until the solar eclipse when Morgana will seize her opportunity to enter the realm of the living and retake what she lost long ago. Excalibur. Who's Morgana? She was King Arthur's half-sister. She is greed, entitlement, vengefulness. And she has awoken. But why? After all this time. Have you seen the world outside your window? This land is divided. Lost and leaderless. Men's hearts have grown hollow. That's why her strength returns. And that is why the sword has returned. And I'm supposed to stop her? That's ridiculous. I'm 12. I'm not even old enough to do a paper round. You'll have to find someone else. It's too dangerous, we'll die. - So, there's your sword back. - (CLATTERS) It's been great to meet you, and good luck with everything. (MERLIN INHALES, SNEEZES) Your quest has been decided. There is no turning back. (CRACKLING) (CRACKLING) (AIR WHOOSHING) (ECHOING) You must find the entrance to the Underworld. Defeat Morgana in her own realm before the moon masks the sun, or you, your people, and the land on which you live, are doomed. (MONSTER SHRIEKING) You have been chosen to save your kingdom from slavery! (GASPS) (GLASS SHATTERING) Christmas Day, that was exhausting. - (SLURPS) - (PANTING) If I have to transform into my adult self every time I need to drive a point home, I'll be dead before the day is done. (SNEEZES LOUDLY) (TWITTERING) (THUD) Oh! Are there no unglazed windows or unblocked chimneys left in this godforsaken country? Mertin... Merlin, wait. How do we find the entrance to the Underworld? - Where do we go? - You're a king, boy. The path you choose must be your own. - (SNEEZES) - (TWITTERING) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. This is the worst and best and most terrible and brilliant and frightening and excellent thing that's ever happened to me. We need to go somewhere no one can find us. Somewhere we can think. Come on, Bedders. It's this way. (BEDDERS GRUNTS) Look. The inscription. It's just like in the book. It's all just like in the book. You were right. He knew. It's exactly the same in every story we ever read. King Arthur, Luke Skywalker, Harry Potter. None of them know their fathers, and then something amazing happens. And they find out they're descended from powerful, magical families. That's me, Bedders. That's me! My mum said he had his battles and his demons. And now I know what she meant. My dad's a hero. He's the key to all of this. We have to go to Cornwall. To Tintagel. We have to find him. But Cornwall's hundreds of miles away. And you haven't seen him for years. He'll know where the entrance to the Underworld is. He'll know how to defeat Morgana. He's the only one who can help us. Look, Alex. It's already dark. Merlin said nighttime would be dangerous. He said the penumbra between light and dark weakens. He said... ALEX: The Mortes Milles will rise again. LANCE: Hello, boys. Nice sword. Looks real. KAYE: Yeah. Real valuable. LANCE: Playing little games, are we? Having fun with our imaginations? We like games. Can we join in? Give us a quick go with that. We'll give it back, I promise. Sure. Help yourself.

I'm the once and future king. I'll pull it out and you can hold it if you both kneel and let me knight you. Oh, my God, you're such a nerd. You're a king, are you? Really? Well, you're not royal. So what kind of a king are you? Maybe he's a Burger King. He's too small to be King Kong. He could be the Lion King. Come on, then, Simba. Let's see you pull it out. You swear, if I do, you'll let me knight you both? We swear. Excuse me. Now, kneel. No way. I don't kneel. Not for anybody. Do it. Then we get to play. (KAYE SIGHS) ALEX: I knight thee, Lady Kaye.

Until I remembered you tricked us into this in the first place. You're coming back to my house and you're not leaving until you explain exactly what just happened. Now, rewind. First. You want me not to smash your faces in? Yes, please. Then you want us to skip school tomorrow morning, go to Cornwall with this freak new boy, find your long-lost dad, kill some demon sorceress, - and save Britain from slavery? - Yes. LANCE: And out of all the people in the entire world, even though there's already a royal family, you're actually the real, true king? Trust me, I'm as shocked as you. Well, there's one thing I don't get. Why would people like us... help people like you? Yeah. Why would we, like, even be seen with you? Because you're the strongest people I know. In the heat of battle we had each other's backs. We just saved each other's lives without even thinking about it. And that's exactly what King Arthur did. He made his enemies his allies. He united the warring tribes of Britain and formed a band of loyal knights. And together, they defeated an enemy bigger than all of them. And think about it. King Arthur's most loyal knights were called Lancelot, Kay and Bedivere. So? So that's your names. Oh, my God. He's right. The legend says Arthur's knights gathered at a round table so that they were all equal. And look... Quick, Bedders. Lift up the flaps. See? None of this happened by accident. This is destiny. This was meant to be. MORGANA: So they think themselves knights? How deluded they are. MORTES MILLES: Deluded. MORGANA: The boy, Beddersvere, is meek. MORTES MILLES: Meek. MORGANA: Nothing without his friend. MORTES MILLES: Nothing. MORGANA: The boy, Lance, is greedy. MORTES MILLES: Greedy. MORGANA: He plans to take the sword for himself. MORTES MILLES: Take the sword. MORGANA: The girl, Kaye, is clever but callow. MORTES MILLES: Callow. MORGANA: Beholden to the boy. And the boy himself, he clings to myth. Trusts in lies. I will prey on their weaknesses. MORTES MILLES: Weaknesses. MORGANA: Their faith will crumble. MORTES MILLES: Crumble. MORGANA: Their hope will turn to hate. MORTES MILLES: Hate. MORGANA: Their quest will be their doom!

(SNAPPING, CLAPPING) MERLIN: Bravo, Alexander. You've survived the night unscathed, emerged with two new allies, and formulated an excellent plan. To journey to Tintagel, find your long-lost father, who will then help you find the entrance to the Underworld and destroy Morgana. You think it's an excellent plan? Really? MERLIN: Of course it is. Tintagel Island is King Arthur's birthplace. It is strong in magic. The Mortes Milles cannot touch you there. Sir Lance, Lady Kaye. A pleasure to make your acquaintance. Do us a favor, Mertin. Don't talk to us. We're only here for the fights. That's hardly the attitude of a knight, young man. Where's your respect for the Chivalric Code? Don't tell me you've never heard of the Chivalric Code. Driver! Stop this coach at once! (PASSENGERS CHATTERING) The Code is the cornerstone of a civilized society, the very credo upon which this nation was built. If you don't know the Code, then this entire enterprise is utterly hopeless! LANCE: What the hell is he on about? Excuse me, but why are we getting off the coach? Shortcut. Follow me. Quickly. No slacking. (SHEEP BLEATING) Halt! Now, pay close attention. The Chivalric Code is the set of rules by which all noble knights live. Obeying the Code from the moment the sword is drawn is what makes you pure of heart. And only a knight of pure heart can slay Morgana. You must commit the following to memory. Rule one. Honor those you love. Easy. Yeah, because you love yourself. Rule two. Refrain from wanton offense. What's "wanton"? - It's Chinese food, I think. - It is not Chinese food. "Wanton" means deliberate or unprovoked. It means don't be rude or swear or be nasty to people. All right. Don't look at me. MERLIN: Rule three. Speak the truth at all times. Easy, again. That's a lie. And finally, rule four. Persevere in any enterprise until the end. Break any of these rules from the moment the sword was drawn, and your quest is lost before it has even begun. I trust that is not a problem. (SIGHS) LANCE: Oi! Mini Merlin! What are you doing? We're not walking to Cornwall! MERLIN: Indeed, we are not.

The most worthwhile path, my young friends, is seldom the easiest. - ALEX: Come on, Bedders. - BEDDERS: I'm coming. - KAYE: Come on, Lance! - LANCE: I hate this already. KAYE: This is further than I've ever walked in my life. If I could get a signal, I'd be in an Uber, right now. Perfect. - Let us stop here awhile. - Oh, thank God! (ALL SIGH) Not to rest. - To train! - LANCE: What? Alexander, hand me the sword. To learn the basics of swordcraft, you will need a weapon, each. A simple duplication spell for metallic objects should suffice. What are you doing, boy? I do magic tricks for a hobby, but I'm no good at duplication illusions. So, I'm gonna video what you do and try and copy it. I'll be most impressed if you succeed. (SNAPPING) BEDDERS: Wow! Now, you have an army to fight, a demon to slay, a country to save. So, let us begin. Your weapons are heavy and cumbersome, but you are light and agile. Use this to your advantage. A grown warrior cannot block their whole body with their blade. Nor can they use its weight to hasten their speed. Use your wits. Be brave and resolute. And... good luck. Good luck with what? What's he doing? (TREES CREAKING) (LANCE GROANS) (CREAKING) MERLIN: I'll fetch some food. A reward for once you've vanquished your foes. LANCE: I'm not vanquishing anything. (SCOFFS) That's it for me. I'm off. Oi! Get off me! (GRUNTS) (PANTING) KAYE: Hey! BEDDERS: Block the branches. - They're teaching us. - I know. (YELLS) (GRUNTS) Come on then! You want it? Try some of this! Ah! Look what it's doing. Gotcha! (GRUNTS) MORGANA: Their quest will be their doom. The sword must be mine. MORTES MILLES: (ECHOING) Must be mine. (GRUNTING) Help! Something's got me. Bedders, watch out! MORGANA: Meek. (GRUNTING) Lance! Kaye! Help! ALEX: Help! Quickly! It's gonna get the sword. I'm suffocating! Help! - BEDDERS: Help! - LANCE: Hold them off. ALEX: Help! Help us! Lance, help. MORGANA AND MORTES MILLES: Take the sword and push. Help me. If you're the once and future king, you can help yourself. No. Lance! No! Lance! BEDDERS: Lance! What are you doing? Help! ALEX: They'll kill you. They'll kill us all. - Lance, help! Help! - No! Come on, then! Come and get it. Let's see what you've got, you stupid twigs. (RUMBLING, CRACKING) (LANCE SCREAMS) Help me! I can't breathe! Help! KAYE: It's pulling me under! - Help! I can't breathe! - Bedders! Lance! - LANCE: Help me! - Kaye! Help! (KAYE SCREAMS) Merlin! ALL: Merlin! Merlin! LANCE: Merlin! Help us! KAYE: I can't breathe! LANCE: Merlin! Merlin! Help us! ALL: Merlin! Help us! (YELLING) Merlin! KAYE: Help us! I can't breathe! BEDDERS: Merlin. Look. Quickly! ALEX: Merlin! Merlin. Are you okay? She's even stronger than I feared. We need beetle blood. Ground animal bone. Something to revive him. It's no use. I'm finished. Until sunrise, you are alone. (GASPS) - (SNEEZES) - (TWITTERING) - BEDDERS: Merlin. Don't go. - (TWITTERS) ALEX: Merlin. If you'd helped me, we could've fought them off. You nearly got us all killed. Give me the sword. No chance. Like I told you... I'm the king around here. (PANTING) ALEX: Kaye, please. BEDDERS: What are we gonna do, Alex? Merlin's not coming back till sunrise. The Mortes Milles will come for us at sunset. And we haven't even - got the sword. - Bedders. Please, I'm trying to think. Stop talking. No. You always tell me to stop talking, and what I'm saying is always right. And this time... This time I'm gonna do something about it. Bedders, wait! KAYE: The water's getting deeper. LANCE: I don't care. Give him back the sword. (SIGHS) It's not yours. Alex drew it. It chose him. It's his. Here we go again. (GRUNTS) That'll teach him. ALEX: Leave him alone! I said, leave him alone. Why should we? Because you always ruin everything. Because you're a liar and a cheat and a bully. You're a bad person. I wish I'd never asked you to join in. All you ever cared about is yourself. LANCE: Yeah? So what if I do? ALEX: I know why you're a bully and a cheat and a liar. I know why both of you are. It's because you're scared. You're scared you're a nothing. A nobody. You're scared you're not gonna get anywhere or be anyone. You think all that matters is how strong you are and how much money you've got. Why don't you shut up and fight? But it shouldn't be like that. That's why the sword came. That's what we're trying to change. Yeah? Well, who made you better than everyone else? Who made you king? (BOTH GRUNT) (GASPS) Lance, no! (CLANG ECHOES) (PANTING) You broke it. You broke Excalibur. You broke everything. That's right. Walk away. Look after yourself, just like you always do. Maybe you're right. Maybe he is a liar and a cheat and a bully. Maybe he is scared and selfish. Maybe we both are. But why wouldn't we be? That is how the world works. Nothing you or anyone does is ever gonna change that. I'm sorry we picked on you. I'm sorry he broke the sword. But we're not knights. We never were, and we never will be. You're better off without us. ALEX: No. You're wrong. We can't do this without you. You're Sir Lancelot and Lady Kaye. We need you! BEDDERS: It's too late. No, it's not. Give me my book. The book always knows what to do. The Lady of the Lake, Excalibur's guardian. She's in every body of water. So maybe she's in this one. If I'm the once and future king... if Lance and Kaye and Bedders are my loyal and brave and worthy knights, and if this is our destiny... then, Lady of the Lake... return Excalibur. (SIGHS) LANCE: I thought something magic was gonna happen. Oh, well. It was worth a try. Hey. - Hey! - KAYE: Alex! Bedders! BEDDERS: Wow. I think that's yours. And this is yours. (WIND WHISTLING) BEDDERS: We're dry. From now on, we stick together. As equals. No dishonor. No lying. No wanton offense. And no giving up. Swear it. I swear. I swear. I thought we weren't supposed to swear. ALEX: Lance. (ALL PANTING) WOMAN: Hey. Are you kids okay? Thank you. Thank you, God. WOMAN: You look like you've been through the wars. What was it, then? Activity day? School trip? Did you get separated or something? ALEX: Listen... this is gonna sound really weird, but if all four of us and these ponies disappear, don't worry. I promise we'll get them back to you. I beg your pardon? KAYE: Whoa. They just vanished. Alex, the sword. Guys, I think we're gonna have to learn how to ride. LANCE: These ponies are way too small. They're for little girls. Those dead things were double the size. KAYE: Do it like show jumpers on TV. Left rein to go left, right rein to go right, bounce up and down in the saddle. - They're coming. I can feel it. - (RUMBLING) MORTES MILLES: Meek. (WHIMPERS) They're here! (MORTES MILLES SHRIEKING) KAYE: They're right behind us. ALEX: Go, go, gallop! LANCE: I don't know what I'm doing. BEDDERS: I can't do this! I'm gonna fall off! MORTES MILLES: Greedy. Greedy. Callow. (KAYE YELLS) This way, into the forest! The trees will slow them down! LANCE: Come on, my little pony. Go faster! KAYE: They're catching up! (MORTES MILLES GROWLING) His quest will be his doom. I got one! BEDDERS: He got one! (YELLS, GRUNTS) Bedders has fallen off! Go get him. We'll distract them. They'll follow the sword. Bedders, I'm coming for you! - (MORTES MILLES GROWLS) - (GASPS) (GRUNTS) Meek. (MORTES MILLES SHRIEKING) LANCE: Faster, Alex! Faster. Nothing. (KAYE YELLS) (BEDDERS GRUNTS) Come on, Bedders. - (PONY GRUNTS) - BEDDERS: Go, go! (GASPING) (MORTES MILLES SNARLING) Bedders, you made it. (MORTES MILLES SHRIEKS) BEDDERS: Oh, no. ALEX: Jump! (WHIMPERING) (GRUNTS) (CHUCKLES) BEDDERS: I did it! I did it! ALEX: Ride! As fast as you can. (MORTES MILLES ROARING) (MORTES MILLES SNARLING) ALEX: I've got an idea. Get off. Follow me. - LANCE: What's he doing? - BEDDERS: Alex! (SNARLING, SHRIEKING) KAYE: Let's go! (KAYE SCREAMS) (MORTES MILLES GROWLING) (ALL PANTING) BEDDERS: There it is. Tintagel Island. You know... we really should huddle together for warmth. No way. I'm not huddling with anyone. I don't huddle. (SEAGULLS CRYING) BEDDERS: Good luck, Alex. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (KNOCKS ON DOOR) (DOG BARKING) Stay. Stay. ALEX: Hello. I wonder if you can help me. My name's Alexander Elliot. I'm looking for my father. WOMAN: You don't remember me, do you? I'm Sophie. I'm your aunt. I'm your dad's sister. Sorry if I'm staring, but you look just like him. I have to talk to him. It's important. More important than anything in the world. You came all the way here from London by yourself? Does your mum even know you're here? All right, then we have to call her. No, this is nothing to do with her. Please don't. This is something I have to do on my own. Well, what did your mum tell you about him? She said they were too young when they had me. He had other things going on in his life. She said he was battling demons. I didn't know what she meant... but I do now. You do? It's okay. You don't have to lie to me. I know who he really was. Then why would you want to find him? What do you mean? He drank. He was angry at everything and everyone. He wasn't a good man, Alex. He lived here for a while, years back. That's when your mum brought you to see him. She thought he might've changed, but he hadn't. I don't even know where he is anymore. Like you said, he had his demons. But I meant real demons. Magical demons, like King Arthur fought. Like in the book he gave me. You don't understand. I'm the once and future king, and he knew. He wrote me this message and he's waiting for me. SOPHIE: But, Alex... your mum bought you this book. This is her writing. - BOY: I want it! - GIRL: Mine! - BOY: I wanna be king. - GIRL: I wanna be queen. BOY 2: I wanna be a king. Alex, what happened? - Did you find him? - What did he say? My dad's not here. And he's not a hero. He didn't care about me. And he didn't want to know me. He didn't even give me the book. My mum lied to me. It's all a lie. I hate her! (GRUNTS) (SOBS) Hey, Alex. I have to show you something. Hold out your hand. Now squeeze as hard as you can. (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) (COINS CLINK) (COINS CLINK) And open your hand. I did it. I couldn't sleep, so I practiced and practiced, and now I can do it. I can do real magic. You can't give up, it's not allowed. We're Han and Chewie, Frodo and Samwise. We can't give up because... look how far we've come. He's right. You've survived three nights against the Mortes Milles. Hundreds of them. All leathery and on fire, with their faces half falling off and everything. You got us here. You turned us from enemies into allies, just like King Arthur did, just like in the legend. You drew Excalibur, Alex. Nothing else matters. ADULT MERLIN: This book you covet, Alexander... Not bad. Pretty illustrations, but... (CLEARS THROAT) ...not entirely accurate. Remember, legends are mere rumors whispered down the centuries. Written and rewritten, told and retold. Sometimes by the rich and powerful so they can hold on to power. The sword doesn't care who your parents are. It doesn't choose by birth or blood, Alexander, but by heart and mind. If your legends say different, then perhaps... you must write them anew. But we're right back where we started. We don't know where the entrance to the Underworld is and there's only one more night until the eclipse. You're a king, Alexander. A leader, not a follower. You need nothing but that which you already have. - (SNEEZES) - (POPPING) I've got it. I know. I know where it is. WOMAN: That's lovely. (CROWD CHATTERING) ALEX: Excuse me, please. Sorry, this is an emergency. KAYE: Sorry. LANCE: Stand back, please. We're on a mission. Clear some space, quick as you can. Thank you. It's the same place. Glastonbury Tor. BEDDERS: That's where Arthur fought Morgana. Lance, Kaye, go along the cliff, find the horses and tie them up at the top of the high street, then meet us at the amusement arcade. Bedders, you come with me. We're knights. We've got a quest to finish. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) (GAMES BEEPING) ALEX: All clear. Do it, Bedders. Go. (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) It's working. - Bedders, you're a genius. - (COINS CLINKING) (COINS CLINKING) - BEDDERS: Hello. - LANCE: Hello. KAYE: Hello. ALEX: We'd like to buy some armor, please. KAYE: Do you take 50p pieces? (GRUNTS) (SNORTS) (BIRD CALLING) The sun sets. And if you do not defeat her, then it sets for the last time. For tomorrow, the moon masks the sun and all is lost. MERLIN: This battle is yours, not mine. Journey with care... be brave, chivalrous... and remember the Code. (WIND WHISTLING) There's no doorway. There's nothing here. I don't understand. (HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING) Alex, look. Let me try something. - (GRUNTS) - (RUMBLING) (DISTANT CRASH) BEDDERS: (ECHOING) This is too creepy. KAYE: It's like no one's been down here for centuries. ALEX: Not since the Dark Ages, when Arthur trapped Morgana. We're the very first. BEDDERS: Four doorways. KAYE: Maybe we take one each. What if it's a trick? What if she's trying to separate us? Right. We should stick together, whatever happens. But... which door? Wait. The sword will tell us. (HIGH-PITCHED HUMMING) It's this way, behind the vines. (GRUNTING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (ROOTS CREAKING) Look at the walls. They're moving. LANCE: They're coming for us. BEDDERS: They're everywhere! (ALL GRUNTING) Stay close. Form a circle. KAYE: There's too many! - (BEDDERS SCREAMS) - Lance! (GRUNTS) (WHIMPERS) - (SCREAMS) - Kaye! BEDDERS: Alex! ALEX: They've got me! Alex, look! (PANTING) - (ROOTS CREAKING) - LANCE: You have to go. Now. I'll hold them off. Now! Go get her! (GRUNTING) (GRUNTS) (GASPS) (LAVA BUBBLING) (GRUNTING) (PANTING) Alex! Alex, we're up here! Alex! She's here! Be careful! (ECHOING) Let them go! (GASPS) (SIGHS, PANTS) (BREATHES HEAVILY) (GASPS) MORGANA: Welcome, boy. MORTES MILLES: (ECHOING) Boy. MORGANA: I've been watching you. MORTES MILLES: (ECHOING) You. MORGANA: You've traveled so far. MORTES MILLES: So far. MORGANA: Fought so bravely. MORTES MILLES: Bravely. I've seen your world. How you live. The myths you believe. Who you trust. It's all lies. Merlin lied to you. Your mother lied to you. You have no noble blood, you have no army. You can't win. (SWORD HUMS) (SNARLS) The world is rotten, Alexander. That's not true! Oh, but it is. (VOICE DISTORTING) You sought the truth, child, and you have found it. - You are nothing... - MORTES MILLES: Nothing. - ...but a lowborn serf. - MORTES MILLES: Serf. - MORGANA: Know your place. - MORTES MILLES: Place. MORGANA: I am the last living Pendragon. (ROARS) (GASPS) (GRUNTS) (PANTING) (SNARLS) (PANTING) - (ROARS) - (GASPS) (ALEX GASPS) The land is mine. The sword is mine. You are mine. (BREATHING SHAKILY) You're right. (GULPS) I'm nothing. Take it. (ALEX GRUNTS) (SHRIEKING) (RUMBLING) (ALEX YELLS, GRUNTS) (ALL YELLING) (GASPING) Lance, Bedders, Kaye, quickly! This way! Hurry! (ALL GRUNTING) (ALL GRUNTING) (ALL PANTING) I think we did it. That was amazing. All hail the once and future king. No, please don't. Really, it's embarrassing. If they catch us with Excalibur, they'll take it away. - We can't risk it. - LANCE: You're right. BEDDERS: Is the Lady of the Lake really in every body of water in the whole of Britain? KAYE: Like, even in a swimming pool? - LANCE: Or a bucket of water? - KAYE: Or a puddle? ALEX: Stand back. (GRUNTS) (SWORD HUMS) Guess that's a "yes," then. LANCE: See you, sword. ALEX: See you when we see you. BEDDERS: Where are you going, Alex? Aren't you going home? ALEX: I'm going over the walls. Then through the back window. BEDDERS: Why? I can't face her, Bedders. Not tonight. I'm too tired. BEDDERS: What are you going to tell her? ALEX: The same as you. The truth. BEDDERS: They won't believe us. No one will. ALEX: So what? It's over now. Good night, Sir Beddersvere. That was a great adventure. Yeah, it really was. Good night, Your Highness-ness. (BIRDS CHIRPING) - (BIRD TWITTERING) - (THUD) (TWITTERING) - (THUD) - (BIRD SQUAWKS) (TWITTERING) - (SQUAWKS) - (GRUNTING) It didn't work. She's not dead. No. You merely wounded her. Her fury and resolve are doubled and the eclipse is in six hours. But why? I did everything you told me to do. Think, boy. Think! The Code. It must be the Code. But... I refrained from wanton offense. I spoke the truth at all times. I persevered... "Honor those you love." Mum. Alex. (MUM SIGHS) How could you do this? The police have been looking for you. I've been worried sick. (SOBS) Oh, thank God you're back. Mum, I've got something to tell you. We went on a quest to Tintagel. I met my Aunt Sophie. I know. She called. I know you lied to me about the book. I know... he didn't even sign it. You did. I know Dad didn't care about neither of us. I'm so sorry, Alex. I'm sorry I lied, I just... I... I just... I wanted you to believe he was good. I thought that if you knew the truth, it would hurt you, change you. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was angry with you. Nothing's your fault. Nothing. You were just trying to protect me. But you don't need to anymore. (BREATHES SHAKILY) There's something I have to do. I have to go to school. And I have to take the sword. Alex... we have to have a serious talk about that sword and this whole King Arthur thing. We will. But I have to show you something first. Everything I said about the sword is true. I can prove it. But first, we have to promise never to lie to each other ever again. To always trust each other, whatever happens. Do you promise? I promise. I promise, too. Now, don't freak out, okay? Lady of the Lake... this is Alexander Elliot. If my quest is noble and true, please return Excalibur. (MUM GASPS) (EXHALES) ALEX: All the time I was telling you to obey the Code, I'd broken it myself. Morgana's not dead. - KAYE: Oh, no. - LANCE: You're kidding. She's coming back... into the real world. That's why we need defenses. A fortress, a castle. The Mortes Milles will rise from the land across the roadway. They'll attack head-on in a great and terrible multitude. ALEX: The eclipse gives us one advantage. It's not night or day. So this time, Merlin can fight beside us. But the five of us won't stand a chance on our own. We need to raise an army. (STUDENTS SHOUTING) PRINCIPAL: I'm relying on you three to set a good example. So when the entire school's out in the playground watching the eclipse, everyone behaves themselves. Is that clear? - BOYS: Yes, Miss. - GIRL: Okay, Miss. PRINCIPAL: Why are all these children walking towards us? And what on earth are you children doing, turning up to school in the middle of the morning dressed like that? Saving Britain from eternal slavery by an ancient, undead evil, Miss. (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) (STUDENTS CHATTERING) Break is over. Quickly and quietly fall in line. Get in line. Break is over. Everyone, gather round. Quickly now. This boy has a very important announcement. My name is Alexander Elliot. A few days ago, I found a sword in a stone. Then I found out it wasn't just any sword in a stone, it was the Sword in the Stone... Excalibur. (LAUGHTER) I know, I know, I know it sounds ridiculous, but it's true, and I can prove it. This boy, Mertin, is really the wizard, Merlin. - (STUDENTS MUTTERING) - And if you don't believe me, then just watch. (INHALES) - (SNEEZES) - (TWITTERING) (STUDENTS EXCLAIMING) (STUDENTS GASP) - How humiliating. - (STUDENTS CHATTERING) Quiet. Quiet. Listen. This country is in danger. A sorceress called Morgana has been sleeping under our soil for centuries, waiting for her moment to return and enslave us. And that moment has come. In two hours, there will be an eclipse. Morgana and her army of undead knights will attack the school. We need you to help us defeat her. All you have to do is kneel and let Alex knight you. Everyone who does gets a sword and armor. KAYE: This isn't a game. This is 100% for real. Flaming swords, fire-breathing horses. So, don't step up unless you're ready. Me and Bedders used to hate Lance and Kaye. And they hated us. We were sworn enemies. But now we know that's how evil tricks you. It turns people against each other to distract them from itself. Because it knows that if we fight together, it doesn't stand a chance. So, who will stand with us today? Who will stand up to save their friends, their future, their country? Who will join us? - (MURMURING) - STUDENT: Nah. (WHISPERING) Activa. And, by the way, this is instead of lessons today. (CHEERING) Excuse me, Pam, forgive us if we're speaking out of turn. I thought we were taking an hour out to watch the eclipse. No one said anything about any kind of historical reenactment. My Year 11's are meant to be off-timetable - for intensive revision. - (OVERLAPPING SHOUTING) I just had all of these made up. Ladies and gentlemen! If I could have your attention for a moment... (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) ALEX: What's your name? BOY: Hector. I knight thee, Sir Hector. Take a shield. Take a shield, move on to the next table. (SNAPPING, CLAPPING) Take a sword. Good. Take a sword. Set the barricades! Lay the ropes! Go, go, go! Tie two ropes on each vaulting horse. Quick as you can, then get ready to hoist! Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I don't suppose I could possibly borrow everyone's car keys, could I? (KEYS JANGLING) Come on. First car on the left. You guys, first on the right. Keep it moving. Well done. One set of keys each. Go. Good. - Go. Go. - (CAR LOCKS BEEP) ALEX: And one! BEDDERS: Left block. ALEX: And two! BEDDERS: Upper block. ALEX: And three! LANCE: Right block. ALEX: And four! BEDDERS: Legs wide. ALEX: And five! KAYE: Use the weight of the sword. MERLIN: You must lure her. Trap her. Give me time to open a portal. Create a vortex. Then you must destroy her so that she can never return. It won't be easy, Alex. We can do it, Merlin. We don't have any choice. We have to do it. (MORTES MILLES GROWLING) (SHRIEKS) (ROARING, SNARLING) All battalions, stand by. This is it. Good luck. - KAYE: Prepare for battle! - STUDENTS: Prepare for battle!

LANCE: Good work! Go! (MORTES MILLES SNARLING) BEDDERS: There's thousands of them. - KAYE: Where's Morgana? - (THUDDING) The barricade won't hold for long. Maybe she's not coming. Maybe it's over. (DISTANT SNARLING) Where's Merlin? MORGANA: Hello, Merlin. You've hardly aged a day. - (HISSES) - (CHOKING) An army of children. Did you think I might take pity on them? After all these years, this is your plan? (INHALES) (SNEEZES) There you are. You have no pity. These children have more goodness and nobility than you can ever comprehend. But, Merlin, I have seen them in their heated hovels, with their toys and trivialities, with their ignorance of nature, of magic. Do you think these little rats are worthy of this land? Of that sword? Of my inheritance? - ALEX: Merlin. - LANCE: Merlin! Yes, I do. You and I are history, Morgana. The future is theirs, not ours. (VOICE DISTORTING) They have no future. (ROARS) ALEX: Let's go! Ready your ropes! - (SNEEZES) - (BIRD TWITTERS) (ALL SCREAM) (STUDENTS YELLING IN DISTANCE) Alex, don't die. I'll do my best. (MORGANA SNARLS) (GRUNTS) Hey, come and get it!

You were so good. LANCE: Well done! Well done! ALEX: Congratulations, we did it. You did it. Well fought. We did it. Well done! - MERLIN: Bravo! Congratulations. - Yes! Heroes! Heroes all! - Yes, yes! Heroes! - Woo! Yes! Yes! Yes! ALEX: Well done! Well fought! Well fought! MERLIN: I've seen many great battles in my time. The siege of Guinnion Fort, the Saxons halted on Badon Hill. But believe me, none were fought as bravely as yours against Morgana and the Mortes Milles. You have truly surpassed my every expectation. Merlin, we won the battle, but Britain's still the same place it was before. Yeah, how can we ever change anything else? And, even with the sword, who's ever gonna listen to us? It's true. We're just kids. That may be so. Yet know this. There is a wise, old soul within every child. (SNEEZES) (GASPS) And a foolish child in every old soul. Perhaps you have more battles yet to fight. They may not be against demons or undead knights, or won with swords or armies. But even if you do not wield Excalibur, you will still know what it stands for... what you stand for. Sir Beddersvere, I gave you the power of metal duplication. I was going to take it away, but now, I believe you can be trusted with it. Really? Seriously? Thank you, Merlin! I promise I'll never use it for anything but good. Sir Lance, Lady Kaye, you are brave, loyal and noble. You have learned to fight for others, not just fight for yourselves. You are truly Knights of the Round Table. Thank you, Merlin. Thank you, Merlin. Alexander, I borrowed this book of yours, made a few alterations. (GASPS) (EXHALES) Thanks, Merlin. A land is only as good as its leaders. And you will make excellent leaders. (EXHALES) (GRUNTS) Subtitles by explosiveskull
