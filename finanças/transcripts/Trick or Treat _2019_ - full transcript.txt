Trick or treat! Well, I think you both deserve a treat. Night night. Get up. Now! Why? Come on, up. Look at our daughter, Greg. I know this isn't easy for you. Well, guess what, you men don't have a monopoly on finding this family life thing difficult. I used to be queen of the party scene, and what am I now? A bleeding dairy cow. Stuck at home all day with an infant. And that's you, by the way, not her. So get yourself another job and stop wallowing. I should be hunting mammoths. What? I should be hunting mammoths. Yeah, with your knee, fat chance. Look, the music industry is dead. Selling advertising isn't so bad. I wasn't put on this planet to do any job. I need to do something that counts. Oh, please, please, do not mention your premonitions. I am sorry, but becoming Mystic Greg on Blackpool Pier is not gonna keep us in beer and skittles. I do see things. The only thing you're gonna see is a psychiatrist, and failing that, a divorce lawyer. You're not a visionary or a prophet, Greg. You're just an ex-raver who nicked too many pills. I don't know why we came back here. 'Cause I didn't want her smoking crack at kindergarten. And our Portobello bedsit was a mansion that's why. There's nothing here for us. I feel strange. Enough! Don't push it, okay? If this don't stop, we'll stop. You don't mean that, do you? I don't know. I just... What I do know is that you need a wake-up call. I love you, I really do, but we can't go on like this. Oh, happy birthday, Greg. Well, almost. A bit fucking late, aren't you? Just the right time to collect your damned soul. Do me a favour... Oh, I'm afraid you've run out of favours. You're not a bit old for this? Death has no age. I've been here since the beginning. You understand me? You're really getting into the role, aren't you? So, what's it gonna be? Well, say it at least. Oh, fuck, trick or treat. Cross my palms with silver or face eternal damnation, come on. Sorry, mate, it's all I've got. You remember,. Your road to hell is paved with good intentions. Where you going? I said why, are we going out? She says, no, I'm going out and I'm turning the heating off. Me and the wife, we've been arguing about those holidays. I want to go to Tenerife. She wants to come with me. Six fellas beating up my mother-in-law. The neighbour says to me, "Aren't you gonna help?" I says, "No, six should be enough." Christ on a bike. What a silly example of a man. Yeah, you. Look at you. You thankless twat, you're pathetic. You're about as much use as a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. About as much use as an ejector seat on a helicopter or a handbrake on a canoe. Kid, kid! I need your help, kid. I need your help, kid. Dan. I've just killed someone. What? I've just fucking killed someone. Shh. What the fuck you talking about? I was driving along, driving along, right? Had a few beers. A little bit fucking wired. I'm driving a bit too fast, and this fucking bloke... He just run out of nowhere and I just smashed right into him. I seriously fucked up. Where did this happen? The little lake, you know, by the side of the Red Line. Did anyone see? - No. - Definitely? Definitely. You sure he's dead? Yeah. What, you just left him there? No. Where the fuck is he then? Outside in the boot. Why'd you put the body in the boot? Look clearly, man, I got out, I go over to him, and he's still breathing. So I pick him up and I put him in the back of the car. I'm on my way to the hospital, I'm driving and I'm halfway there to the hospital... And he just fucking dies there and then. He stops breathing there and fucking then. But you should have still taken him to the hospital 'cause they could have saved him. Listen. He stopped breathing. He died, and I'm well over the limit. Twice minimum. These days, you're looking at 10 fucking years inside. Do you understand me? 10 years inside! Fucking more with my shit. I don't see you for nine months and then you come here. This is a windup, ain't it? It's a fucking birthday windup. There's no windup, kid. Keys. Just what exactly do you expect me to do? Well, you got to help me. You and me, right? We're just gonna get rid of it. Now. In the sea, on the moors, anywhere. We'll burn the car. We'll just tell the police it were nicked. You've got to drive, kid, 'cause I'm well over the limit. No, no, no fucking way. No, no, no, no, no, no. After what you fucking did to me? Fuck, whoever that is, I'm not here. Right? Please, kid, okay? Okay? Hi, Clarence. A bit late for a social visit. It ain't a social, Greg. So London never worked out, then? Yeah. It was great. Just time to move on. Yeah? Maybe move back. Aw. You got a little one. Abby. A little girl, four months old. When's the last time you had a proper bit of kip? About four months ago. Poor cock. It's your birthday, is it? Yeah, born exactly 45 years, nine minutes ago. Hold on, you were born midnight Halloween? Doesn't that make you some sort of a witch? Yeah, something like that. Very nice. Punching above your weight a bit in here? Daisy never had a chance. How is Daisy? Like you give a shit about my sister. So what's going on? Well, we're looking for your brother. You haven't seen him, have you? Nah. Haven't seen him for months. We had a fallout when I first moved back. That's weird 'cause his car's outside. Okay. Okay, yeah, yeah, he popped 'round about an hour ago, just to say happy birthday, mate. He was hammered. Properly hammered and he was trying to drive to the Strand, and I said no, no way, you know, not in that state. So I took the keys off him. Well, they're just over there. That's weird, 'cause the fuck knows what's happened to them. He then got in a taxi. And that's it. So the rumours are true. You've turned into a boring cunt. Huh? Come with me. Jesus. I didn't know there was a market for the grunt mags anymore with Internet and all that. Maybe there's a certain... He saw one kick and was sort of nostalgic. You know, like hipsters getting back into vinyl. Fuck, lads, lads, I seriously. Shh. Let's just give your brother a ring, shall we? Cock Womble. Dear, oh dear. We're gonna have to search your gaff. I don't what Dan's been up to. There's the baby and my wife's upstairs, and seriously, you don't want to... I don't give a shit. Lesley, stay and watch him, will you? And don't you worry. I'll be as quiet as a dormouse. Clarence, please, I cannot let you go upstairs with that. Seriously. No, listen, you fucking, you fucking touch them... And you what? Please, leave the weapon. Let me go to her, please. You are coming with us. No! This ain't up for discussion, mate. Boss wants to see you. What, you mean Damo? Damo, what, you really are outta touch, ain't you? Jesus, no, that guy got shot years ago. Now our new boss, mate, she's something else. You may even like her. Welcome to my parlour, said the spider to the fly. It stands here. Here. Hmm. You're a pretty one, aren't you? But obviously a bit old for me. That's better. I don't like the surly ones. Oh, the surly ones, they bring out the worst in me. You're gonna have to tell me something, Gregory, and no fibbing, mind, 'cause I'll know, and then things will become less agreeable. You need to tell me where your brother Danny is. Listen... Don't fucking tell me to listen, you little fucking prick! I'm sorry. Sorry. He came over to the house a couple of hours ago just to wish me happy birthday and then he got in a cab to the Strand and that's all I know. Do you know, Gregory, there's only one thing I love more than Ronnie here, and that would be my son, Baxter. And the last I heard from Baxter, he was heading off to see your Dan to talk about something heavy. His words, man. And he hasn't been seen since. And he's not answering his calls, and now, nor is your brother. Listen. He left his phone at the house. I know where he left his fucking phone! What he said about Karen is true. Oh, Gregory, you were about three seconds away from getting a blind dog for Christmas. Look, Clarence here tells me that Dan's slut works over town. So maybe, just maybe, your story stacks up. I would suggest you start your inquiries with her. Now you listen. If my son or your brother are not standing where you are by 2:00 a.m., I'm gonna let you choose if your wife or your little girl dies first. And son, don't try and do a runner 'cause I'll split you from here to here. Understood? Trick or treat. What the fuck are you doing? Keep your eyes on the road. So Daisy tells me you were a bit naughty back in the day. Oh, really? Found out soon enough I wasn't built for that kind of caper. Yeah? - What happened? - Nothing. Nah, nah, nah, come on, tell me. Oi. Tell me. Well, one day about nine years ago, Damo asked me to come along with him to pick up some goodies. So we drive off, meet some bloke in the woods to do a deal, but Damo, he don't wanna do a deal. No, no, no, he's got something else on his mind. Before anyone said a word, he's just got this screwdriver out, it's like really working him. And I so wanted to stop Damo. But I didn't, and that poor bastard, he just slipped away right in front of me. I went to London two days after that. So how's fatherhood treating you? It's... It's great. I wouldn't change it for the world. Yeah? Right. Don't you miss it, the buzz, the girls, the fun? Oh, yeah, yeah. The sort of stuff I can handle. Yeah, you can't have your coke and snort it. You must be bored though, no? Bored, I'm fucking bored shitless. My life's a waking nightmare, it's just duties, obligations, chores. My old man, before he got himself killed, did fuck all for us kids. Didn't change a single nappie, nothing. Went out, brought home the bacon. Mom brought us up. Clear demarcation of roles, and now, I'm, I mean, it's confused. So, what do you actually do all day? I change nappies, I sterilise bottles, night feeds. It's relentless, it's fucking relentless. Man like you doing all that stuff, it ain't right. A man like you should be out hunting mammoths. What did you just say? Turn right here, park over up the right. Evening gentlemen, table for two? Yeah, is Karen here? Yeah, but she's a bit busy at the moment, so... Back room, right? How's it going, mate? Clarence, what are you doing here? Yeah, Clarence, lad, I thought you only liked your kippers warm. Ah, kippers. You still order kippers? Hold on a sec. You take the piss out of me I'll fuck you up, do you hear me? On you go. Boys, boys, boys, how's it going? What do you recommend? All of it, sir. Even the flowers? Maybe leave those for dessert. Listen. Karen, I'm not really here to eat. I'm supposed to be finding out where your boyfriend is. Who? Dan. Dan Kielty. Haven't seen him for weeks. Thought you guys were supposed to be... No. Not anymore. Anyways, I was only ever his bit on the side. Okay. Well, thanks. I hear he's still carrying on with his brother's wife. What did you just say? He's having an affair with his brother's wife. It's the worst kept secret in Blackpool. Everyone knows. Everyone knows? Yeah. And I doubt the brother's gonna be around for much longer either. Gonna be around? I hear they want him out of the picture. And soon. Apparently, he's a right moody bastard. Listen, there's four boys from Blackburn turning up to eat soon. When they're done, I'm free. Free all night. Sorry. Married. Don't mean you can't have your bit of fun. No, that's exactly what it means. She was a stripper, man. Used to light the light bulbs with... And he's not heard that mad thing. They've actually invented a food that stops women giving blow jobs. Are you serious? Seriously, it's called, no, what is it? That's it, wedding cake. Psst. There's another way out in the back. Thanks. You look like a man with a lot on his mind. You have no idea. Trust me, I've heard it all. Not this you haven't. Sounds serious. I just heard my brother is fucking my wife. Okay, well, that's serious. You know, my old man used to say to me, he said there's three sides to every tale, his, hers, and the truth. My advice, don't do anything stupid until you know the truth, the whole truth. Too many men in Strangeways doing life because they did something stupid when they didn't know the whole truth. - Ta. - Keep the change. Thanks. The fact that you're sitting here right now talking to me, and the countless million-to-one chance that it took to bring you into existence in this desolate, lifeless universe, I mean, the mathematical impossibility of it. You don't know it, pal, but just by being alive, you've already won the lottery. You're a winner. Life is a miracle. Don't throw it all away. Oh shit. Fuck, that was close, wasn't it? You all right? Kid? Kid? Do you remember when we were about 12 and you said you'd seen Dad on the pier and that he was alive and well and you chatted to him, and he'd said he'd missed us? Do you remember when I asked you to look me in the eye and tell me again, and you couldn't? You just ran away. You can't lie to me, kid. I can see right through you, every time. So, I'm gonna ask you two questions, and you're gonna look me right in the eye and you're gonna tell me the truth, okay? Look at me. Look at me. Okay, first question. Are you fucking my wife? You're joking, right? Answer the question. Greg, I'll look you in the eye all night long and I'll give you the same answer. Well, then tell me. Say it. I'm not fucking your wife. I swear on my life. Then why the fuck did that human dinner plate just tell me that you were? What? Karen. Karen. Karen is the biggest shit stirrer in Blackpool. Fuck that. In the county. I'm not exactly her favourite person right now. She'd have clocked you the minute you walked in, and there's no way that she's gonna miss an opportunity to use you to fuck with me. Karen, kid. Come on. Okay. Okay. Geez. Second question, is the poor cunt in the boot, Baxter. Yeah. Fuck! Why, Dan? Why? This goes no further. Not even to Gemma, right? Last year, I got nicked with four Ks, and you know I can't do that kind of time. And your Baxter, right, he's heard something and he comes 'round today, and he starts throwing accusations at me. So you killed him? I thought he was your mate. I didn't mean to. An accident, with a pipe. You're a fucking prick. You've killed us all. No, no, no, no, no, no, you listen. Listen, I thought of a way out, right. I've put the body back in the boot. We dump it near the Anderson's HQ. Ms. Ferguson assumes it was them that killed him. Nothing to do with us, we keep still, we'll be all right. I might be able to do that, but you, they'll come asking for you and you can't lie for fucking shit. I'm a better liar than you think. A lot better. Who's the other glass for? Well, it's for you, innit? I knew you'd be back at some point. So, what do you think? Well, I suppose if this plan of yours doesn't work, I know we'll have to leave the UK, right? Maybe, why, what are you getting at? Then maybe we're gonna head to Europe or something. You know, split up. Maybe you take Gemma and the baby, meet up later. Something like that. What were you looking at when I came in? Nothing. Honest. All right. I'm looking at bad porn. Embarrassing. With the little one upstairs. You still use your birthday every time, right? The nasty bastard's outside. We've got to get you and your car the fuck out of here right now. Listen to me, I'll take Gemma's car. He'll follow me, then you take your motor and wait for me at the north end of Pear Lane. I'll stop next to the south end, wait until he parks up, then run over to you, okay? - No fucking way. - Take it. It's not a game. We can do this. I know I can. It's you I'm worried about. I'm not finished with you yet. Get in! Get the fuck out of here, now, now, now! Better get off the road. Why, oh, why did you come 'round tonight? Just when I thought I'd reached rock bottom, then you turn up. Yeah, well, it's when you hit rock bottom that you make changes. Positive changes. What the fuck you talking about? You know I'm always there for you, kid. You know that, don't you? I thought you were, till that last little stunt you pulled. Oh, listen. I've apologised for that a thousand times, Greg. In a bad place back then. Yeah? Well, I'm in a pretty fucking bad place right now. This life. You know you're not cut out for it, don't you? Yeah, I know that, Greg, and that's why I want out. - Badly. - Then do it, because in this line of work, you've gotta be ruthless. No conscience, no remorse, no guilt, nothing. I'm sorry, Dan. You just don't fit the bill. You don't know how lucky you are, mate. Hm? What I wouldn't give to live your nice, cosy, simple life. What I wouldn't give to have what you've got. Well, you might not believe this, but while I'm scraping baby shit from me fingernails, it's you I think about. Oh geeze. My next 20 years are mapped out. I think about your life and the good old days. No responsibilities, no mortgage, no baby, no wife, no mundane routine. What you have is spontaneity, freedom, fun. What a joy that'd be. Really? There's not a day goes by I don't think about getting on a plane and heading off to Rio. Just me, my passport, and a wad of cash. Grass is always greener, right? Yeah, I guess it is. Thing is, mate, my life's not all swimming with dolphins and orgies on superyachts. I stay all drunk and seedy bunked up in budget hotel in Blackpool. Oh shit. What the fuck are we gonna do? Keep calm. The body's still in there, right? Yes. Okay. Remember how this goes. He'll come to your side first. Easy does it, wind the window down and calmly explain we're heading home after a party. Tell him you gave up booze three years ago, okay? Look him straight in the eye. Slow and stern, is there a problem, officer? Repeat. Is there a problem, officer? Again. Is there a problem, officer? Okay, here he comes. Is there a roblem, ossifer? Pardon? Is there a problem, officer? Well, that depends, sir. Have you consumed any alcohol tonight? No, sir. I haven't had a drink in three years. Really? Well, maybe that's just bullshit I can smell then. And may I ask what you two gentlemen are up to at this late hour? We're just brothers, just having a chat, officer. Licence, please. Keys, please. Stay there. Some fucking gangster you are. Roger that. So, Peregrine Morgan of Wellington, before I breathalyse you, I just have one further question. Is there anything in this car that shouldn't be there? Don't think so. You don't think so. Definitely not. Please get out and open the boot. You stay there. In your own time, sir. This side of Christmas would be nice. Was that fucking gangster enough for you, eh? I need to piss. No, we need to get the fuck out of here now. Today's society is blighted by an epidemic of depression, and it is often men, especially those who have been programmed not to speak about their feelings, they struggle to cope. This repressed mental anguish can become untenable as men approach middle age and they realise that their dreams will never be fulfilled. Subsequently, suicide is now the single biggest killer of males under the age of 45. At Wake Up Call, we provide a range of services designed to read into the client's mindset. For example, we stage-manage extreme scenarios incorporating acquaintances of the client designed to sabotage destructive patterns of behaviour. You all right? Yeah. Has Gemma told you I've not been feeling right recently? No, I haven't spoken to her since... I know she's worried about me. Thinks I'm having some sort of breakdown. Talking about couple's counselling, NLP, all that kind of bollocks. Of course, I'd never go down that road willingly. I don't get it. I think you do. No, Greg, I really don't. Just when I'm getting fucked off with this dull life of mine and harking back to the good old days, I'm suddenly shown in an oh so fucking clear way that the good old days really aren't that good after all. You've lost me, mate. Don't treat me like a fool. Clarence, he played it about right. Might not get an Oscar, maybe a BAFTA. And Ms. Ferguson, Jesus Christ. Any hammier, I'd have brought out the Dijon. You think it's a wind-up? Give me the keys, time to get back to Strand. It must be getting really stuffy in there. Are you mad? His head's a bloody mess. All right, if you want, I'll show you. Now this fellow's okay. He's no De Niro, six or seven out of 10, tops. Let's face it, he's got a fuck-all dialogue. I was just telling Dan here you probably shouldn't give up the day job. Tom Cruise isn't exactly quaking in his little boots. Oh, fucking hell! Lesley, you don't seriously think that I had something to do with Baxter's disappearance, do you? I don't get paid to think. Yeah, but that doesn't mean you can't think for yourself on your own time, sort of thing, does it? How can you possibly do that? That would be the intellectual equivalent of moonlighting, and as long as I'm on company time, I'll do what's required of me. That's a bit limiting, isn't it? Look, every gang needs its silent, nasty-looking bastard, and when I joined Ms. Ferguson's outfit, that was only vacancy available, so you make do, don't you? You basically saying we should all just accept our allocated role? Not for society as a whole. That would be akin to living in a quasi-feudal system. However, the corporate wheels run smoother if employees simply accept their lot. The stoics of ancient Greece such as Seneca and Marcus Aurelius... You mean that fellow in Gladiator? Those fellows argued very cogently that to break the natural order of things simply results in chaos, and that's the last thing Ms. Ferguson needs. Well, if she did engage that impressive brain of yours, you would realise that Dan here wouldn't dream of harming Baxter. Well, that just may be, but seeing how this conversation on gambit is a rather clumsy attempt to persuade me to let you go, your innocence or otherwise means nothing. Releasing you is illogical, so we'll cease discussing it. - Okay. - Fair enough. And you, dafty, no funny business. I have my finger on the trigger of a loaded revolver pointing at the base of your spine. I'd appreciate it if you'd keep stumm about our conversation when we reach our destination. I'm the silent nasty one, remember? Baxter ran away from home once, you know. Just 12 years old. I've never been so scared in all my life. Two days past, he still hadn't come back. I was in pieces. No more balls back then, man. I thought the little bugger had been kidnapped. Later, on the second day, he comes strolling into the house. Get this. He said he'd been to look at the sea. But not just here, mind, on the east coast. He wanted to see if it looked the same. He'd been to Grimsby and back, fucking Grimsby. 12 years old. There's something special of that boy. Always has been. You little prick! Running away was a real big fucking mistake. That's the spirit, Clarence. You'll get best supporting actor for this, right? Oh dear, you are really gonna get your fucking... Gently does it, Clarence. Plenty of time for that. Have you boys seen "Scarface?" It's gotta be one of me favourites. It's a classic. A fucking classic! You know the scene where Al Pacino was forced to watch his buddy getting chopped in half with a chainsaw? Oh, I love it. Well, bearing that in mind, I think we now all fully understand our roles, hm? So, let's begin. Look, this joke's gone on long enough. Frankly, I thought his poke in the eye was a little excessive. Don't get me wrong, I'm really impressed with your commitment to this project. But, enough's enough, okay? This one I like, he's got big cojones. Yeah, not for long he don't. Not for long he don't. Oh, oh! Now, Danny boy, this is a one-question quiz. Any hesitation, repetition, or deviation will result in your brother getting mutilated, understood? Where's my son? Ms. Ferguson, please, I swear I have no fucking idea. I haven't seen him since this morning. Really? And what was this heavy thing he had to chat to you about? Well, I'd rather not say it out loud. Come on, tell me. You can share it with the class. I can't really. Fucking say it! He came 'round to say he thought Clarence was a snitch. What the fuck? Don't listen to this little cocksucker. Silence, Clarence. I've got his number. So, you don't know where Baxter is? Honestly, I haven't got a clue. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. Rule number one, never say honestly when you're lying. It's a dead giveaway. But I'm gonna give you, or rather your brother here, one more chance. I have no fucking idea. The thing is, Daniel, why would I believe a treacherous little shit like you? I know all about you and his wife. Keep it in the family, eh, Dan? Eenie, meenie, miney, mo. Catch a liar by his toe. Listen. Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk. This is a con. I know what's going on. Does this look like a con, Gregory? Or maybe you'd like another cut, eh? What the fuck is going on? I've seen the website he was looking up, Wake Up Call. This is a scam. I know what's going on. Greg, no, that isn't for you. That's for me. I've been looking into every way there is to help me get out of this fucking hole that I... Shut the fuck up! Oh, poor me, tsk, tsk, tsk, poor me. Pour me a fucking drink, Reynaldo. Well, I'm afraid, Gregory, that things are gonna get a little bit more serious now. Once more, and this time with feeling, where the fuck is my Baxter? I promise you, Ms. Ferguson, I don't know. You sure about that, Dan? Of course, I am. What do you think, I'm just gonna let... You absolutely sure you don't know anything? I'm sure I don't know anything, Greg. Really? 'Cause I've got a feeling, a little feeling, that you might know something. You might be able to lie to her, but you can't lie to me. Ever since we were little, I can tell. All I got to do is look you in the eyes. I'm gonna give you one more chance to do the right thing. Come on. Look me in the eye and tell me the truth. Look at me, brother. What are you gonna do with that, Gregory, light a fag? Cut him free, now. Do you honestly think that's real? How about we find out? No, do it. Ms. Ferguson, it's real. I sold it to him. So what? Do you think this is the first time I've had a gun pointed at me? No, but it might just be your last. Cut him free. Nice one, kid. Go and get his piece off him. Over there, please. Move. And your car keys. On your feet, Reynaldo. Everyone over there now. Now! That's better. That's much better. Hurry up! Come on, in here. Wait! Give us your mobiles, come on. You as well, Ms. Ferguson. This isn't gonna end well. You do know that, don't you? You look like you've seen a ghost, kid. It's nothing, forget it. What the fuck are we gonna do now? I don't know, kid. Hang on a minute. She knew about you and Gemma. I thought it was just Karen's shit stirring. It is. Karen would have told Clarence at the restaurant and he would have reported back, that's all. They fucking know where I live. They don't seem the forgiving type. It's not gonna take them long before they find out about you-know-fucking-who either. Fuck me! This makes your fucking last stunt look like a freaking birthday present! Oh man, stop harping on about that, will you. Harping on about it? I nearly got my fucking head kicked in 'cause of you, you fucking prick! Always fucking trying to be the big man. Trying to be like Dad, trying to be me. Trying to be you? A depressed, pussy-whipped loser? Are you fucking joking? Your life is so fucking awful, the only surprise is that you haven't topped yourself already, hey! Fucking turn your back, you prick! Sorry. Shit, I'm really sorry, kid. Kid, fucking hell, sorry. It's fine. You know, we're gonna have to get out of this town. I'm talking America, Asia. Any fucking where but here. You're right. We're gonna have to split up. I'll go home, and I'll get me passport, and I'll meet you at Manchester Airport. It's the only way. Let's go. Were you gonna grass me out back there? Nah, kid, just stalling for time. You should have more faith, brother. You're not driving, not with your arm. And I'll take the car and drop you off. You get a cab to go to yours, okay? Okay. What are you gonna do with the body? Don't worry about that. I'll work something out. Sorry about all this. I ain't finished with you yet, Dan. I know. So I'll see you at Manchester Airport. Keep your mobile on. You still get them visions, kid? Then tell me this, brother, how's this all gonna end? I love you. Me too, kid. So, what's it gonna be? Trick or treat? All right, Gregory. Gregory. Oi, dickhead. I don't like the surly ones. They bring out the worst in me. Where the fuck do you think you're going? Get away, Clarence, you fucking know this is real. Well, so is mine. But it's a lot fucking bigger. Now, now, Clarence, no need for that. Get the fuck out of here and no one gets hurt. Stop, or I'll shoot. You're not gonna hurt me, are you, Gregory? I'm serious, fucking stop right there, now! Jesus, Greg, did you really think that someone like me would be interested in someone like you? 10, 15 years ago maybe, but you're old enough to be me dad. Oops, look who's here. Gemma, what you doing here? Trick or treat, kid. Dan. I got you. Maybe now you'll appreciate what we have. What you gave up wasn't fun. It was horrible. And because you never listened to me, you had to find out the hard way. Do you really believe you're the first bloke to feel like this? Or woman for that matter? Adjusting to this stage in life is tough. But it's time to grow up, babes. Oh, mate, I'm so, so, sorry if our methods seem extreme, but extreme times call for extreme measures, and your mental state is becoming untenable. You needed to see the past for what it was, reject it, and embrace the future. Love and routine are far more preferable to chaos and insecurity, are they not? This truly is the first day of the rest of your life. Fuck. Kid, what's happening? I fucking killed him. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck? - Who? - Baxter. He wasn't dead, he opened the boot. And now he's fucking dead. What'd you do, shoot him? I killed him. I fucking killed him. What, wait a minute, with the gun I gave you, right? It was an accident, it all happened so fast. What have you done with the body? I put him back in the boot. Listen, we stick to the plan. I've got my passport and I'm near your gaff. So I'm gonna collect Gemma and Abby and we're gonna meet you at Manchester Airport, okay? Okay. Okay. Fuck. I know all about you and his wife. Keep it in the family, eh, Dan? I'm not fucking your wife. I swear to my life. I'm a better liar than you think. A lot better. What I wouldn't give to live your nice, cosy, simple life. What I wouldn't give to have what you've got. Sorry sir, kitchen's closed. I'm not here for food. I need you to tell me what's going on. What's going on? Yeah, what the fuck is going on. Please tell me. Four pricks from Bellamy just ate raw fish off me naked body. Nothing unusual to report. I thought they were from Blackburn. Whatever. That thing you said about Dan, is it true? What thing? Is my brother having an affair with my wife? Oh my God. You're the moody brother? Shit, you really are, aren't you? Look, I don't want to be the bearer of bad news, but yes, that little wanker's been fucking your wife for months. Maybe years. You're just shit-stirring. I didn't know who the hell you were until 10 seconds ago. Really? Listen, Dan told me a story. Happened about nine months ago, just before me and him got together. I think that's what stopped you two talking. He said he promised his brother, I guess that's you, that he'd act as backup in some dispute you'd had with the builder, only Dan never turned up, and you got the crap kicked out of ya. Little prick. Right. The reason he didn't turn up is 'cause he was with your missus at the Imperial having a whale of a time, apparently. And you know, the way he told that story, it's like it were a joke. Like he were proud of that scumbag behaviour. I don't think you should go anywhere. There's nothing for you back home, and anyway, what you need now is some TLC. I bet you haven't had any in years. Years. Life is short. Why waste your time in a dull marriage when there's so much fun to be had. Don't tell me you're just another lost man, whaling around trying to work out what his role is. I love you. Gemma, I think Greg knows. We need to leave ASAP, be there in five. Love you. Guess what? Quick, come. Don't worry about that. Just get the basics, get a few nappies. Get a couple of Babygros. We're travelling light. Oi. Are you all right? It isn't easy, you know. Greg and I... There was a time when it was all ahead of us, when it was so much fun. There was a time I wouldn't have dreamed of doing anything like we're doing now. You're too strong for him. He doesn't give you what you need, you know. I didn't change, he did. I could almost see him shrinking in front of me. That dynamic, strong, confident man, the man I fell in love with, what happened to him? Life, that's what. Some people can take it and some can't. Look what you got instead. Why've you got cotton when you can have silk? Just look at her. She's got your eyes. I know. Greg's a dipshit. He's so fucking self-absorbed. We could have five more and he wouldn't work it out. Way too pretty to be his. So he's heading straight to Manchester Airport? Yeah, and obviously, we're going to Liverpool. Well, I do hope he makes it out. Me too. I love you, Gemma. I always have. I love you, too, Dan. I'd like to report some screams coming from 15 Felix Stowe Road. There's something very, very brutal going on in there, you should send someone over sharpish. Yeah, thank you. What the fuck is he doing? I don't know. I'm going down. No, no, no. For this to work, he needs to discover us himself. Greg thinks the gun Dan gave him was real, and he actually shot Baxter. It is now that he must actively come to rekindle his love for his baby and his wife, relishing in you the connection he momentarily doubted. Our analysis strongly suggests that the psychological gains of this entire scenario will be diluted... Fuck that. We'll be here all night. Where the fuck is he? What the fuck? What the fuck. They were blanks. This can't be right.
