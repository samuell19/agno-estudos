You know, you kinda have to go inside. Um, it's not just standing there with your hand in a car, you know. It's more of a spiritual experience for me. I think that's why I went. You know, I went... I think focus, drive, and some strength, obviously. There are not that many big dogs out there. I'm the biggest of them all. The wolf.

Breathe underwater, for sure. EDISON: I'd rather have $1,000. Then I could pay for my mom not to work for a whole month. And we could go to Disneyland, Chuck E. Cheese, and go to the movies. And then I can get a new skateboard. SAGE: If you could breathe underwater, you could hide and scare people at the beach, and see when sharks come in, and look at girls' butts. My brother, Chris, he always talks about ass. Ass this. Ass that. "Dat ass tight." And titties. He loves titties. - Titties are pretty cool. - [CHUCKLES] Would you rather be invisible or shoot fire out of your butt? Fire out your butt? Chris, he lights his farts on fire. Invisible. Everything would be easier to do. Wait. Will anybody see me? No. Invisible forever. Fire then. I could use it for self defense. [IMITATES FART SOUND] And he'd smell like a burnt fart, too. [SAGE CHUCKLES] I wish I had a brother to burn farts with. SAGE: Yeah, it's pretty cool. Me and Chris hang out a lot. Hey, maybe we can see downtown from up there. If only I just had some Internet, I could have checked on the map. Chris, he gets his Internet from Starbucks. He doesn't even buy anything, though. I thought you had Internet at your house? Yeah, we got all that. Cable, Netflix, video games... All that shit. What I meant to say was Chris just goes to Starbucks when he's not home. EDISON: Oh. My mom wouldn't even buy me a TV. You're lucky. Internet should be free everywhere. Like invisible Internet right here. And over here. And over here. Ah! SAGE: I'm really tired, dude. Come on, let's take the bus. EDISON: No, dude, I told you. We're not taking the bus. SAGE: Wow. Fine. I promise it's all right. I take the bus all the time. It's so fun on the bus. You know how there's all those bars in there? People hold on. I always swing around on 'em. Last time I went on the bus, I was swinging around the whole entire thing. It's just... Watch out for people. Don't like... If you swing, look out for people. Don't hit 'em. But yeah, they don't... They never really care. It's me and him. I thought you only had change? Does this bus go to downtown? - BUS DRIVER: Yeah. - Okay. SAGE: Hey, yo, Edison. Hey, Edison. Look. - Come on. - No. Dude, come over here. Come on. Come on. Don't be a wuss. Come back here. Fine.

Barely going anywhere. Ooh. We took that new metro line. Mm! Real nice train. Did you say train station? Yeah. Oh, about two blocks over there across the boulevard. Love me some Blake Griffin.
