We used to ride 70, 80 miles a day, and I think I'm a cowboy first, a conservationist second, and then a writer third. Nothing better in the world than the feel of a good horse, and a good saddle. As a child, I wanted to be a cowboy, I wanted to ride tough horses. My dream was to get good enough that I could go to a rodeo and come out of the shoots on Five Minutes Till Midnight, or some of those legendary old outlaws. I never have turned down an adventure, and there are a lot of stories in my life yet untold. The worse thing anybody ever called was an environmentalist. I never look back when I have an idea in my head, I go ahead and do it. Hanging the circumstances. I've always felt that man didn't have dominion over wildlife, as some religions claim. I think man rather has a responsibility to take care of all their other fellow travelers on this earth. 1988, I went down to Northern Nevada to buy some cattle, to stock my ranch in Oregon, when I passed a government wild horse holding facility, in Lovelock. The corrals were packed with unhappy Mustangs, standing in boredom, gaunt ribs, heads hanging in sleepy stupor, lips drooping, eyes half closed against swarms of flies. They were just miserable. I was angry that they'd come to that. I'd been going up with wild horses, and owed them for a lot of joy in my life, and I just had the feeling that I was the guy who had to do something about it. So I phoned my kids and told them to take over the ranch, I was going to go and find a place that I could set up as a wild horse sanctuary. People thought I was crazy to do that when I was 62. It's hard to believe that he had the energy to do that at that age, but Dayton's a man that has to have a quest. Once he got these horses as a quest, why, it's taken over everything else in his life. He's done so much just to get them here. He fought the government, he fought the neighbors, he's fought everybody. Now we're here just southwest, I guess, of Hot Springs, South Dakota, the southern edge of the Black Hills. What do you envision for this particular site? The potential for this land in the Black Hills here is just tremendous. Our idea is to put together some big fenced ranges for them where those horses can then be controlled. But can live a great lifestyle. In 1971, congress had passed a wild horse and burro protection act, so I had to get congressional approval to do a sanctuary. How long have you been working on this? It's taken me a year and a half, and I think I probably spent four months of that in Washington, D.C. Talks to every congressman and senator I could buttonhole. How often do you have someone come to you, that looks like he just climbed off a horse? That says, "I've got a solution to a problem "that you've had in Nevada for ten years." Horse lovers see them as national treasures, to be protected at any and all costs. Many ranchers, however, see them as dangerous competition for their cattle, and would like to see far fewer of them. There are about 37,000 free wild horses in the American West, more than half of them, right here in Nevada. But the Federal Government says that is simply too many. A wild horse is an animal which doesn't have any predators, so you do get a situation where their breeding excessively, and exceeding their range. They increase at the rate of about 15% a year, the problem is too many horses. These horses had to be run in out of vast areas, and most wild horses are captured by a helicopter and men on horseback. So even 40 years down the pike, wild horses still go crazy when they see a helicopter. It's cruel to take a horse off it's home, and put it in a corral someplace. And it is a great problem for the government, so what I was trying to do is come up with an easy solution. Everything we tried, prior to the man walking into my office, didn't work, didn't even work a little bit. With Dayton Hyde, we at least have hope. I just was stubborn. People were telling me it couldn't be done, and that's the wrong thing to say to a cowboy. I stuck to it, and when I came here, I spent the first summer building eight miles of new fence up over the rocks. Didn't want them getting away, out into the neighbor's fields, and these wild horses had no sense of barbed wire. So we had to build a training field, we had ribbons tied up, and we kept them in there for three weeks to teach them what barbed wire was. Since then, we've done an awful lot of fencing, probably 15 more miles of good fence. And all these years, we've never had problems. Today, we've got about 500 wild horses, and 12,000 acres or so. I'm probably more concerned with animals, and birds and nature than I am with the human species. The horses are my friends, so I have lots of company here in the Black Hills. I'm just another happy horse, I guess. I was born up in Marquette, Michigan, 1925, long time ago. When I come here, of course, there are the ghosts of my family. My dad came down with multiple sclerosis in 1929, the year of the Depression, lost his job, he was in his 30's, and he walked with a cane for awhile, and then he got progressively worse. We had a ramp built so he could roll down the ramp, onto the dock, and he'd sit there and watch the sun come up over the lake. But occasionally he would get going too fast down the hill, and go right off the end of the dock, and we had a pole with a hook on it, and we would fish his wheelchair up out of the depths, and he'd be ready to go again. I think he worried that I enjoyed being alone too much. I hadn't seen another kid my age all summer, and there were a bunch of high school boys standing on the corner, talking about transmissions, and brake drums, and things like that that I didn't know a thing about, but I was desperately lonely, and I walked up and said, "Hey, you guys, I found a Blackburnian "Warbler nest this summer, and it had four eggs in it." And they turned and glared at me, and I turned and ran back to our cabin. My mother went off picking blueberries, I was supposed to babysit my father, or sit with him, and make sure he didn't need anything, and my father said, "I've got a surprise for you, there's a Cedar Waxwing nest "right outside my porch." And he was all excited. I said, "Old birds, their not worth anything." And I just took off, running. Oh, man. I remember picking a yellow violet, and spinning it in my hand, and turning it into a blur of gold. Finally I remembered my father, and as I approached the cabin, I could see the screen door was smashed down, and there was blood on the pine needles, and it scared the life out of me, and there was my father, lying under the cedar tree, flat on his back. He said, "A big snake crawled up and tried to get "the nest, but I got him." What he did was, wheel his wheelchair to the screen door, and threw his body at it, and there was a big, flat snake underneath him. He'd fallen on the snake. But ever after that, I thought if a man like that could enjoy birds, well, it wasn't too bad if I enjoyed them, too. Just adding diesel to our tank for the pump, put water in the tank for the horses. This one on red, or. Junior's my oldest son, and lives in Oregon, and works in construction. Hey, Dad. He comes back two or three times a year just to check on me, and helps whenever he can. We're kind of kindred souls in many ways. A five gallon bucket would fill faster, and make me feel like they're getting something. I'm pleased with what he's done here. Certainly left his mark over the years. But I don't think I've got the same background as my dad does on horses. At home we'll ride the trails just for the heck of riding. But nobody rides when they come here. 500 horses, and not a single one of them broke. And, I've seen a stud kill a saddle horse, so, it's not going to happen here. Anytime you get this many women together, there's always a lot of fighting. South Dakota historically has ten years of drought and ten years of wet. So, even if they are free roaming, somebody's got to make sure that there's water. We have to be the managers and the caregivers. We say that the horses own the land, we're just here to help them so they can have enough food and enough water. I was 13 and my uncle had written a letter from Oregon saying that his cowboys had just run in 30 wild horses, and were in the process of breaking them. What kind of letter is that to write a kid, if you don't expect him to run away and join you. You've got to remember that the Depression had been on, and people were hungry, and I felt that I was a burden on my family. So, I went down to the rail road yard, and got on a freight train, headed west. So, wild horses drug me away. No matter now that I had neither spare clothes, nor money, and every bit more of 60 miles, from home. I'd yet to ride a horse, but at that moment, I was already a cowboy. I was a naive kid, I guess, but I think I was running away from myself. I got to my uncle's ranch, the Yamsi Ranch which is in Chiloquin, Oregon. He had about 90,000 acres of range that he leased from the Klamath Indians. I was named after my Uncle Dayton, and I think he felt a certain bond with me because I was named after him, and he loved my mother. We'd brand calves for three weeks straight. And haying season would come, and it was hard work. Somebody described that ranching operation as one big mismanaged emergency after another. But I loved it, and spent as much time with the cowboys as I could. And eventually, some of them showed me how to hold my reigns, and how to get on a horse so they wouldn't kick you in the shins. Little by little, I got to riding horses better, and breaking colts, and riding bucking horses. I spent all my time on horseback, and I always regretted having to get off a horse to go and eat. For a long time, I worried about the blizzards that sweep South Dakota occasionally, but the horses seem to love those blizzards. When there's a storm, they get right out in the middle of it, and stand in the open where lesser animals seem to go for shelter. You ready? We're going to release this stallion into the herd. And hopefully, we'll get some wonderful paint babies from him. There you go, baby. There you go, baby, take it easy. Take it easy. Take it easy, it's just a little step there. Hello. There you got it. We only put out as many studs as we need foals. The stallion has never had his own band before, so he's going to get kicked a few times, but he'll learn and eventually he'll stay in the herd. - I don't know. - Make sure he doesn't get kicked too bad. The reason we breed them at all is that there's some very valuable blood in these wild horse herds here in the sanctuary, and we want to keep that blood alive. Also, by breeding a few foals, we have something to sell to help support the sanctuary. And the mares are a lot happier, and more peaceful, just a few babies to fuss over. I've been looking for you, bays. That's more mares than most stallions can keep track of, if they have competition, but in this range, he's the only stallion, so he can handle them pretty well. And if one of these mares disappears someplace, and is left behind, well, he'll go hunting for her and put her back in the herd, he'll know she's gone. Boy, he's just pushing them where he wants them. Yeah. He's driving them now. Come on babies, run for it. Beautiful to see. Jesus, it's cold. Yeah, typical spring in South Dakota, is it? As a teen, I loved being on the ranch. But in the winter, my uncle didn't know quite what to do with me, so he sent me down to California to The Cate School in Carpenteria, south of Santa Barbara. I was a terrible student. I was good in English and that carried me through. But I was always desperately afraid to get kicked out of school, that was my recurring nightmare. And every time the Headmaster would send me note to come and see him in his office, I would just panic. One day he sent me a note, I thought, here it is. I'm headed back to Northern Michigan, a complete failure, a disgrace. But then, once I got there, there was an elderly couple. We had tea, and I sat like a little mouse, and listened to all this grownup conversation. All of a sudden, a bird called a Pallid Wren-tit sang from the chapparal, and the woman said, "What bird is that?" And I started in and a Pallid Wren-tit and how it's headed into the ecology, and I was really waxing poetic, and all of a sudden I realized everybody's listening to me in silence and maybe embarrassment and I turned and I felt a hand on my shoulder and the man, the old man there, put his hand on my shoulder, and when I turned, he said, "Go on, go on, "that's beautiful." And tears are streaming down his cheeks. Well, that was Alfred Noyes, the English poet. He would come to the school after that and get me out of class and I'd walk in the hills with him and he'd recite The Highwayman and come down to Kew in lilac time, lilac time and lilac time. Come down to Kew in lilac time, it isn't far from London. That was, I think, another turning point in my life, cause the fact that somebody who was that notable, had taken an interest in me and encouraged me, well, it just, it meant a lot. By then, I wanted to be a writer, but I knew that I would have to do a lot of adventuring, and a lot of learning before I'd ever be able to write a book. The old man who sold me this ranch said. "You'll starve to death, but there'll be lots to look at." To me the great tragedy in the West is the demand for housing. Our National Parks, and wilderness areas are overrun with people now. There is no place to be alone and be quiet and observe wildlife. This land was sacred to the Indians, cause the river that flows four different directions out there. Ten thousand years ago, there were Indian villages on top of that ridge. There are a lot of cliff writings here, and wonderful pterygoidea. More than ever, it has become a piece of land we're saving, and the horses, are my partners in saving this land forever. Come on, babies. Come on. We have it set up now so it can never be built on, so in a hundred years from now, when I come back as a horse, well, I'll have this place to gallop over. Places like this is probably going to be the only place you're going to see wild horses, in the next ten to 15 years. And it's just a national treasure that we cannot lose. I wish everybody I've ever met and known would come here and see this. You're going to see a homestead up here to your left, the feller was named Fergouson, that lived in it, he was here around in the 1870's, 80's, we hope to refurbish it, because once it falls away, it'll be gone forever. We have visitors from all over the world. They've heard about wild horses, they've heard about cowboys, they want to come to the West and see it all. Oh, look at that old mare over there. The horses just keep on doing what they're doing, so I think that's really cool. I didn't expect to be this close to the horses It's great. But they wanted to come right up to us. That was very neat. To be able to see the natural landscape, undamaged in any way, you feel like you're a part of the landscape or you have a chance of noticing the value of that. Hey, let's keep this, let's keep some of this in our country, let's not destroy everything with modernity. These horses here, about 80% of these is domesticated broodmares, and about 20 to 25 of them horses are wild mares. We kind of call them our naughty mares, because they kept a trying to find boys when they were with the other horses, so we've got them penned up here where they're easier to see and where we can keep them away from the stallions. How can you tell if a horse is a girl or a boy? Well, that's a good one. Well, a boy. That's a pretty good one. A girl uses. Just like you can a man and woman. Yeah, just like you can a man and woman, that's the best way of all. There were horses like doing horse stuff, and beating up other horses going, bam. We petted a horse, it just sort of walked up to us. You usually see horses, like kept up in pens, or in barns, it's just really a neat experience to see all these horses running wild in the prairie. I wish I could take every horse in the world that needs a home, but we have to be real about how much we can manage. My battle is to keep this place going. We're lucky to break even. We have a good tourist trade, but it's still tough. There've been times when we've lived on Grape Nut Flakes here, for weeks at a time, because there simply wasn't the money to buy food. Work seven days a week, no vacation, and there are no salaries. We'll get it done, one way or another. Because that's what we're about. That feels good, yeah. That makes my days, I get to talk to a horse. I graduated from The Cate School in 1943. The war was on, and I was drafted, and as I was heading to basic training, going from Reno east on a troop train, we passed a bunch of wild horses. The train whistled and started those horses a running. And for a magic 15 minutes, they ran right alongside of the troop train, cause they're over there all saying goodbye to me. I've never forgotten that sight of those horses running free, when I was a captive. I didn't go across an immediate invasion. But, you know, shortly after where the beach was still littered with bodies. It was in The Battle of the Bulge, in the Rear Pocket, and was in Patton's third army. What I remember now is not the artillery shells going off and planes going overhead, but I remember the cold. Whenever we got a chance, we'd do a little fire, and cook bacon and I've never tasted anything better in my life. I was a long time getting back to the ranch. Stationed at Camp Polk near Leesville, Louisiana. I paid the fine on a scrawny mare that the sheriff had impounded and hid her in the empty barracks next to mine. Every night I would slip out and lead the poor animal to graze on orderly room lawns, until finally, she put some meat on her bones and began to prosper. Oh, look. When at last, I was discharged. I bought an Army surplus truck, loaded my mare on the back end, and struck out for Oregon. And there she goes out the gate, right there. There you go... That's the way horses ought to be able to live. World War II changed the West. When the war came, a lot of cowboys took jobs in aircraft factories, so they didn't want to come back to the 30 dollar a month wage. And then Social Security came in, so all the old cowboys, instead of staying around the bunkhouse, and telling stories for the rest of their lives, they moved to town. So the oral tradition was gone on these ranches. But they had wonderful stories, and I got them down as best I could, before they were only a memory on my own part. I had to come and see and meet you. And tell you how much I enjoyed it. I read all about you in the paper today, that's what brought me here Did the same thing I said to my husband, Same for all of us I'm getting dressed and going over there. I'm so excited, thank you very much. Writing has given me a tool to change the way people think, and the way that people do things. The first book took off, and I've written I think 20 others since then. Just put to a fellow horse person. Well, all the money that this book gleans in, all goes to the horses. What a wonderful thing to be doing. Well, it keeps me off the streets. Every book I've ever written, I've lived those events. Even though some of the books have been fiction. Who's down there? What's going on here? Happy birthday! I've made it all these years. Looking good. How are you, cowboy? All right. Oh, my god. This is a major surprise. I didn't realize how many friends I really had. I'm not a very vindictive guy, but I had one great enemy in a rodeo. It started when I was an 18 year old beanpole, and this guy was whipping his horse, because he missed a jump on a steer. And I threw myself up to my six foot five inches, said, "You'd fight a horse, but you wouldn't fight a man." And he went right over his horses' ear and knocked me out. I came to, and the great cowboy, Slim Pickens was pouring cold water on me. Said, "I don't know who you are kid, but you're "not too bright." I was just overwhelmed by the turnout here. And I'm sure that my uncle is smiling that I'm still using his jacket after 50 years. Thank you very much for coming. It was a little hard to come back from the Army and go back into an institution. But I knew I had to write, and the next four years, I went to the University of California at Berkeley. When you go to a university as a cowboy, you miss the open spaces and the closest I could get would be go to rodeos. While I was doing that, I started taking photographs. Photographs gave me a lot of entree to a different world. And I'd go behind the shoots before a rodeo, and talk to those famous horses. Badger Mountain, Steamboat and Five Minutes Till Midnight, I wanted those horses' autographs. Here's a photograph I took for Life Magazine, which is a picture of the week. Here's a picture of my friend, Slim Pickens, that I took for Life Magazine many years ago, when Slim was truly slim, before he became a movie actor, he rode the bomb in Dr. Strange Love, and made a lot of movies. Here's a picture of Slim Pickens fighting a bull, with a cape. I'd lie down and take photographs of bucking horses, and Brahma bulls. The bulls didn't bother me at all, and I wasn't scared of them, so I decided that if I ever got a chance to be a bull fighter-clown, I would go that direction. A bull would be through bucking, so we'd go out with our cape and whirl around, and we'd distract a bull, and we saved the rider from being gored. When you save a guy's life, well, he kind of becomes your friend. I rode some, but I wasn't the greatest bronc rider in the world, but I was probably a fairly good bull fighter at the time. Photograph here of me, when I was 65 years old, and came out of retirement and exhibitioned a Brahma bull, fighting it with my sport coat jacket. Every now and then, I'm watching television, watching a rodeo, and I see a saddle bronc come out, and I think, "Well, I could ride that." And then I get to thinking, "Well, that's 60 years ago." It's hard to realize when you get old that you can't do all the things you did as a young man. Great run for her, 20.08, third in the average race, you can show that he wins. Dad, do you want to move the cows, or can I just open the gate and push them up the hill? No, I want. - You want? Okay. - Move them. We're going to do it at nine, then. Goodnight, Dayton. I'm glad you're here. I'll give that cow a few more hours. There's some acreage here that's not suitable to the wild horses. The cows are pretty good, because in case we had an economic difficulty, we could always load up cattle and take them to the sale. Is anything calving? Yeah, one's going to start pretty soon. - Thank you. - Okay. This is a really great deal to be able to have a few cows to fool with. "Now and again, a heavy cow, belly distended "with hay and cow, flicks her tail nervously, "as the birth process begins, "and wanders off, feigning nonchalance, "seeking the shelter of the pines, "where she finds a windfall screen from the wind, "and from prying eyes. "From beneath her tail, a sac forms, "and distends like some giant blue star sapphire, "and as she lies and strains, the sac breaks, "flooding the pine needles with pearly fluid. "Soon come the yellow and white front feet "of a tiny calf. "Then, as she strains and rests, and strains again, "the first pink of the nose, "then head, then strain on strain, shoulders, "gaunt ribs, flanks stained yellow with body waste, "then hips, then at last the calf comes "with a final rush, breaking the cord. "Falling low, she lurches unsteadily to her feet, "and turns and with great rough tongue, "licks the afterbirth away." So how many generations is the date of a ladder? Well, yeah. It's helpful when Dayton comes out, cause he gets a lot done that I'm too old and decrepit too get done. Andrew, will you throw me up the ladder of the knife? My son Andrew's actually come out here for several visits. - Let me see the rope. - He never had a chance to grow up around horses, but Andrew's been here, so that's an okay. It's probably as good as I can do as a parent. Go see the elephant, see what it looks like, see what it smells like, see what it tastes like, and then make your own, I'm not going to tell him. Okay, you or, where's my pocket knife? I dropped it up there, Dad. Okay. Is that enough? Don't look down. Just one more step, just one more step. One more step, Mr. Hands, and I'll shoot. It's even harder than it looks, isn't it? When I finally graduated from Berkeley, I went up to the ranch, and my uncle wasn't very pleased with the fact that I wanted to be a writer, and he said, "Do you want to ranch, "or do you want to write?" With him, there were no two ways. So for a time, I thought I could just be a rancher, and I met Gerda at Berkeley, and she'd had a lot of ranch experience, and was a great horse woman, and I told her I owned this wonderful ranch, and actually, I didn't own any land, it was all in my family, but she bit for the bait, got married, and moved up to Oregon. When she got up there, it was too late to turn back. "My frantically busy wife, who now cooked meals "for an average of 20, felt hellbent about her matriarchal "domain, gathers, moves, doctors and sprays the cattle, "taxis children, runs back and forth to town for parts, "referees other peoples' fights, wins her own, "handles everything on the ranch her slothful husband "forgot to do. "And it is a constant challenge to her inventiveness "to disguise for me that she can really do most "anything, far better than her husband. "Surely, the rural wife is a great, unsung American." We got married, that was in 1950. I was kind of homesick at the beginning, but I learned to love this country. Our oldest son is Dayton, Junior. And then we had Virginia, and Marcia, and then John and then Taylor. They're about two years apart. Morning. Hi, Dad. How are you? I cut up to Dad now, how many hips do we have between us, Dad? I don't know. Five, five hips. We're hippies. Yeah, five hips between us. Yeah. I remember you, Ginny, riding across this field here in four feet of snow, it was right up to the horse's chest. Yeah, it was deep, boy. Every time he gets this pneumonia thing, I just have a terrible time. Yeah, that's just from allergies, and it's not going to slow me down, and I'm not going to give up horses, even though some doctor said I was allergic to them. That's worth the allergies. Hmm. I live too far away from him, and I never get to see him. And he's so special to me. He's the best dad in the world. I can't get to South Dakota, I just can't manage it. Well, next time you see me, my knees will be working again, and I'll be able to ride horses with you. We'll go ride the meadows the way we used to do, and ride up in the forest. Oh, that'd be great. "Grasshoppers buzz busily "in the tall blue grass, "which is so thick and heavy, it is falling over in a mat. "Blackbirds scold from fence posts, I pass their nest "on Ditch Bank, Grass Clump, and Willow. "In the rickety old barn, a late nesting horned owl "raises it's brood. "March hawks sail plane lazily as they patrol "the ditch banks for mice, "while sparrow hawks and strikes watch "from the swaying hammock of the telephone lines." We had so many animals. Gosh. Toby, he was a porcupine. A coyote was digging a hole under him, so he would tip over, so they could get to the underside of him, and we couldn't drive the coyote away, so finally, we just brought him home, and he was here for 18 years. Over the years, we had everything except badgers. And I mean everything except badgers. But growing up, you were either feeding hay to the cows, or you're cutting it and baling it and putting it into the barn. I think that was the distinct seasons of the year. We were always driving cattle from here to the marsh, or here to the BK, Bk to here or whatever. I was on horseback more than I was off, I think in those days. Dad was in a great hurry to get me on a horse, and I think about four years old, I bounced off of a horse, into a tree, and I didn't really ride for, shoot, eight or nine years. That put me into the tractor, and the haying and all of the mechanical and the fencing and all of that. I think the ranch is a better father to the kids than I was. Cause it kept those kids busy, and it gave them a work ethic that never failed them. I was so busy writing my books, probably, I wasn't as close a father as a lot of fathers could have been, so. "Like the rumble of wagon wheels, "the sound of Whooping Crane and Sandhill alike, "is part and parcel of the history of our land, "and our Western heritage. "The battle cry of the Comanches gone, "and the thunder of vast herds of bison. "But the sound of the crane still rolls "faint and far across the prairies. "We cannot let it die, for once silent, "all the science in the world cannot bring it back." I was very concerned on the ranch and the marshes there because the Sandhill Cranes were disappearing. So I reasoned that it would be good to develop a way of raising them in captivity. And I notice Sandhill Cranes laid two eggs, hatched two eggs, but one of the young birds disappear. So, I reasoned that if I could take one of those eggs, and hatch it out in captivity, and develop a captive flock. Which is what happened. "I would spread my arms, flap them like wings, "and Sandy would croak with delight, and follow suit, "round and round the garden, over the back fence, "out of the hot summer fields. "And then one day, catching a sudden gust of wind, "Sandy became accidentally, and irretrievably airborn." So I was raising Sandhill Cranes, and putting them back into the wild. But to advocate nest robbing, made everybody mad. Scientists called me the most dangerous man in American conservation, because I was advocating that. But the Fish and Wildlife service got interested in my experiments and further the things that I'd found out. And eventually, I'd program Help Save the Whooping Crane, too. Now the Whooping Cranes have gone from 11 birds to almost 400. So, when I see a Whooping Crane go over, even many years later, I'm happy to have been part of that bird's history. That was a book called Sandy, and the book did very well. But my family didn't appreciate the fact that I'd included them in the book, and they were a little afraid that things hadn't happened exactly the way I put them in a book, but, no author can write the truth and sell the book. He has to learn to be a little bit of a liar, and make things more exciting than they really are. I wouldn't read his books for years. Wasn't till, I don't know. Till he wrote the book about a fly fisherman, that I read anything. Cause I didn't want to have to judge him based on what he wrote. And I think that's what everybody else, they assume that I know him because that's what he wrote, but it's just like, somebody taking a picture. It's just another element to his whole personality. Well, the lake's still there this morning. Morning, Dad. Looks out there. The Pelicans are out in front this morning. It's just kind of a nice spot to come home to. A lot of hard work went into that dam, it's still holding up after what? 50 years, or? - Well, let's see. - 40 years? 40 now, 30. Yeah. This is my lake that I built. But it's not on the maps. Change it to in a boat, Dad. I consider it my major accomplishment, when I built that lake. This is a big meadow, and in the springtime, the melted snow water would gush through it, and do a lot of damage. I got a permit to build that dam to stop the erosion. When I filled out the papers, I said I had a degree in ENG at the University of California, Berkeley, and the state engineer thought it meant engineering, and I knew it meant English. I had only four months in which to build the dam, so I bought some old equipment, and I had a 13 year old son driving a 35 ton tractor, a 15 year old driving a 24 cubic yard earth mover, and I drove a terribly dangerous earth mover that was all electric, and when the electricity failed, you had no brakes, no steering. There were times when we'd run out of diesel, and I'd go and sell something just to buy another barrel of diesel. My neighbors laughed at me, and called it 'Someday Lake' and 'Hyde's Folly'. But we got the dam built on time, and when the engineer brought down a crew and inspected, he finally said, "You know, "you built a better dam than any commercial person "would have built." The lake has three and a half miles of shoreline, and it's a stopover now for migratory birds. Hundreds and hundreds of geese and ducks, and swans, and all manner of wildlife use that lake now, because it's the only water in miles. There comes the Pelicans, flying in. Look at them, aren't they beautiful? And we have those in South Dakota to, so. Well, I woke up this morning, missing the horses and even as beautiful as this place is, in two days, I'm ready to go for the Black Hills. I've been gone from here for 24 years, so. A lot of people I don't know. Smile and wink, you're cute. A lot of relatives are here. Friends, family, people who used to work here, it's really exciting. The ranch was started in 1911 by Uncle Buck. Buck Williams. And, about '59, I think Mom and Dad bought the ranch. So it's been in the family a long time. I've been here working for about 30 years now. Got to love it to do it. Cause it doesn't pay very well. Okay, I'm going to, can you hear me? Yes. She's worked her tail off all her life up here. It means a lot to her. I don't know if I work hard, I just, we just keep trying to do a little, something a little better every year on the land. Are you fishing with your red liver, John? There's a lot of fish in there. The Yamsi's my Mom's project, and the wild horses, my Dad's project. It creates quite a bit of stress in the family. The other one of our generation is Hawk, Dayton O. Hyde, where are you, Hawk? Oh there you are. My Mom probably thinks that things could have turned out differently over the years, Let's try it again. One, two, three. My daughter, Marcia was a wonderful horsewoman, and she had a great sense of humor, and made people laugh, and filled them with joy. When Marcia was 22, she was killed by a horse. I was down at the lake, writing another book. Marcia and her mother had gone to gather the cattle at the far end of the ranch, Marcia got off to open a gate, and when she went to get back on, apparently the horse must've bucked, or done something, because my wife looked around, and Marcia was lying dead on the ground. Marcia was 22 when she died, and had just been married, and was about to get her first paycheck, and she was hoping to take her husband out and buy him dinner that night. It was a shocker, it just didn't seem fair. To take her at that time. It was, losing a child is never easy. And, I don't know, if it changed anything, really, but with a big family, you just have to keep going. We had other children that needed to keep going, also. Mom had tried to resuscitate her, and she was in the middle of nowhere with no help. And so she finally had to just let her go. And then she rode up to Deep Creek Ranch, which was about a mile and half or so, and get help. She just blamed herself, I think. I was up in Dayville at the time, and she got hold of me, and she said, "Marcia's dead." And then hung up. And I didn't have a chance to say what, how, when, where, and it didn't dawn on me till we were down here, and doing, you know, I couldn't believe it. It just, I still can't. We rode a lot together, and I wasn't a very good sister, I don't think. I was pretty jealous of Marcia, but she had a magic with horses, she had a touch for them. She could take one that was sort of like a mean horse, and make it just really nice. Yeah, it was hard. Yeah. It wasn't the horse's fault, and we kept that old horse to a grand old age. I think it helped me leave that land. Made me think that I was maybe vegetating there, that there are things yet undone that I've got to fulfill. Dad used to have a very wonderful way of leaving a party. The correct way was never say goodbye, never say see you later, or anything. The correct way to leave a party was, "Where's Dayton? "He was here a moment ago." And he just left. He didn't... you expected things to continue, you didn't have to make this big show of saying goodbye. You simply left. I thought he would always stay on the ranch but he decided to move on. He's a roamer, and I guess that's what he wanted to do. It was a little painful for everybody. But, I think when you get to be our age, if you want to go do something, you'd better go do it. It was tough. I don't know. I don't know that I want to really discuss it. I wish I could have them all out here with me, but they love the ranch in Oregon, and nobody wanted to come with me, and that's understandable. They had their own lives. He followed his dream, you know. I guess he needed that space, and found his own way over there, so yeah, it's hard to see him go, but nice that he calls. I want my kids, I guess, to know that I tried hard in everything that I did. I rode hard, and rode horses hard, and ranched hard. I'd do things differently, everybody would, but I don't think I'd change it a lot. I think I'd still leave the ranch in Oregon, I think I'd still be here. My solace is that Marcia would love what I'm doing now. These horses were on their way to the slaughter house. And Ford Motor Company intervened, then they paid 19,000 dollars to reimburse the broker, for the monies he would have gathered from the slaughter plant, for the sale of the horses. And then we stepped in and said we would give the horses a home. Well, I'm glad they're in. I guess the more that comes, so. Yeah. Some of them come in here and they don't even know how to eat hay, and they'll take a wisp of hay, and then, they'll get scared, and they run, they don't know to open their mouths and drop it, so they've got this big hanging string of hay there. Well, I better get this back on the road. I've got to go placate a few people, I hurt a lot of feelings telling them to get the hell out of here. Come on. Come babies. These horses are not going to suffer anymore. We'll see that they have a great life. They'll go out like blazing comets, over the grasslands, so they can live out the rest of their lives, and nobody'll ever frighten them, or be mean to them. We hope to give them peace here. This is a healing place. Like a beautiful painting in a museum, it does something to cleanse souls, and people can't come here, and see these horses and be the same people they were when they came. You know, there's an old saying that the outside of horse is good for the inside of a man and it's very true. I grew up at a farm in Iowa, where I always had horses. But when my dad died, the farm went, and the horses went and sorry. But this is great. Hi, Annie. I have an affinity with Annie, because we're both loners. Her mom died when Annie was about a month old. So Annie's been alone pretty much since then. There you go, Annie. I feel really privileged that I get to know at least some of the horses. Oh, yum. Spent my first two weeks building fence. There are days out here in the winter where you can be the only person on 20 square miles, pretty easily. Working with Mustangs is the nicest thing about this, and you get to see them turned loose again. The horses teach me patience, for sure. If you do have the patience, they do come up to you, and you build that trust and I think that's kind of unique. Oh, doesn't that feel good? This ranch is a working ranch, with real cowboys, and real horses, and real cattle. When you're here, you feel whole. Good morning! You're up early. Only with the chickens. If we don't do it, if we don't save this land, and save the horses, there's not anybody else to do it. So, we have to do it. Come on. There's no choice. That's a good boy. It's our destiny. It's my destiny to be here. Bring her over here, and let me see her. You did a good job, Gigi. This is a domestic horse, Gigi, that was born here, and she's just had her first baby today. You did such a nice job. Yes, that's a pretty baby. Wow. When I first came here, Dayton said, "Well, maybe if we had a domestic horse "business, we could raise some horses and sell them "and the income from those horses could help "take care of the wild horses." And, that's what we did. Put my fingers in her ears, so she won't be afraid, as she gets older. Susan's a good hand to these foals, they like her. What a pretty baby. - What's the matter? - Hi, handsome. Just fixing your shirt here. Oh, okay. You know, I'm from southern Alabama, I might not be in South Dakota today, but there was a turning point in my life, 1990, I saw Dayton Hyde on 20 20. Come on, and get your grain here. Hungry horses on a cold morning in the Black Hills of South Dakota. I was so impressed with what he was doing, and I remember seeing his face and thinking what a brave man he was to seek out his mission in life. Grain tastes good on a cold morning, doesn't it? And the same year, my daughter was killed in a car accident. I was totally devastated, I mean my world had just turned upside down. How could this possibly be? You know, she was 17, her life meant so much to me, and to so many people. And in 1995, my husband passed away. Suddenly, just, one minute he was there, the next minute he was gone, at age 46. I would wake up in the middle of the night thinking this is not reality. So, I started looking at my life, and I wanted to be different than I was. I wanted to know what it was that I was supposed to do. And I went on a trip to Africa, and in a hot air balloon over the Serengeti, I'm looking down on the zebras and the wildebeest in migration across the grasslands, and all of a sudden, this face popped into my memory bank. His cowboy face. Susan called me up from Alabama, and I couldn't, I had a bad phone connection, and I couldn't understand a bit of what she was saying, with her Alabama accent, and so I kept saying, "Yes." And about two days later, a volunteer in the office called and said, "There's a woman "here who said you invited her out." And I said, "Well, if she's cute, I'll take her on tour." And she stayed here, and thank goodness she did, because I couldn't run this place without that help. It was a Saturday morning, and I drove over the hill, the first time, and came down into the valley, and I thought, "This is it." Hello. I felt like my whole life was leading up to coming here to South Dakota. What are you doing, huh? What are you doing? You know, don't you emasculate me. You're too late. Dayton has been my friend, and my companion, and my teacher, and my inspiration. Okey doke. I fell in love with a cowboy that I saw on TV. You asked me what I wanted for my birthday, I wanted to watch it rain. Wow and a rainbow to boot. - Yeah. - It takes a lot of burden off me, having somebody else to share the worries. Been so long since I saw rain, I had to ask you what it was. It's just as though the good Lord designed somebody perfect to come and help me. It's raining down over the hay field harder than here, that's great, right where we need it. I'd never seen double rainbows till I came here. It's nice to have company, and someone there that can share your dreams. You go look for one pot, and I'll go look for the other. What we need on this ranch is a pot of gold. The horses, they're all enjoying it. Can I comb your hair for you? Sure you can. And a little makeup would go a long ways, too. You're combing my hair. Susan's been the person taking care of him the last how many years. This is what happens when you get to be 80. Susan's not the reason that Dad came to South Dakota. In fact, it was almost eight or ten years before she even came into the picture here. So, I think a lot of family members say that Dad came from Oregon just because of Susan. No. Find out somebody can put some joy in my Dad's life, that's not a problem for me at all. Hey Dottie, do you have a licker license, huh? Get them, oh yeah. I can't think of any of any of the old cowboy laws that aren't still applicable today. Like, never saddle anybody else's horse. With cowboys, you don't order them to do anything, you ask them. So point of honor with a cowboy to quit. Yeah. On his terms. I've seen that all across the years. Whiskey Jim quit 65 times at the Bar Y, then one day, we'd look, and there'd be Jim sitting at the table. There's a lot to be said about that code of honor. Yep. There they are. I've had friends retire, and drop dead of a heart attack within a week. You might not be able to ride a horse, but you can still write a book, or debate, may be a lesson for all of us. Big enough to be the boss of all these guys, huh? You big enough to be a boss? When I come here, I kind of realize that I haven't accomplished anything, so. I need to redirect what I'm doing and where I'm going, and how I'm going about it, so. Horses are creatures of the wind. When these horses run, I just feel as though I can go out and run with them, and gallop free on the prairie. It's overpowering. The beauty around you in all the things that you see, in hawks, or. You can see why people fought over this land. I'd fight to stay here myself. My name is Aduwakanatak-yate. In English, Tom Cook. My wife and I have Sun danced continuously for 37 years. Sun dance is the greatest ceremony of the Lakota people. All of the Oglala bands, seven of them, would gather together, about this time, and put up offerings to the sun. - This was our 14th, or 15th. - Yes. And we're still arguing about it. Yeah. There have been other places, to Sun dance, but with unbelievable restrictions. For instance, in Wind Cave National Park, you're welcome to Sun dance, but we've got this regulation, "No open fires." What do you mean, how can you, how can you talk to the sun without actually having a fire? We spent ten years at Devil's Tower, complaining about them climbing the rock in June, while we're praying. And finally, we came here. This land is full of Indian spirits. Once when I went into the cave there, with a Medicine Man, we sat down, there's immense wind that filled the place through with dust, and we couldn't see each other, sitting next to each other. And then that suddenly went, and you'd hear voices and singing, and the shadows of faces on the rocks. I don't know how to explain it, but there's something there that just isn't understood by present day people. Dayton is a Holy Man. A man of great vision, respect and appreciation for my Father's, he provided us the support to dance here. On the first day of Sun dance, we usually dance in the four directions, starting with the west, the north, the east and then to the south. So as we were dancing toward the north, about 12 horses came up. My niece told me, she said, "Auntie, look "our ancestors arrived by horseback." And they were all at attention. Really reverent, you could tell our ancestors arriving, you know, on horseback. That was how she put it. I saw it. And the horses came, 5:30 in the morning. Hi, Loretta. Hi, Dayton, how are you, Little Father? Oh, I'm great. Dayton is about three weeks younger than my dad, so he called Dayton Little Brother, so that's why I call him Little Father. He's very tall, taller than my Father, but to me, you know, he's Little Father. Did you get to come up during Sun dance? I came up, I've never seen a better organized - Sun dance than this it was. - I think so. Just beautiful. I would like to give him an Indian name this year. This coming year. And so, we have to pray about that, so that we can come and have a wonderful name for him, something that embodies who he is, and how he is to people and the horses. His feeling for this land is so reverent that we, the same thing that we feel, he feels. You know, you want to treat it the best you know how. We want this land to be better in a hundred years than it was in a hundred years past. We're fighting the uranium miners now, and it may be my last great battle that I'm fighting. In 2007, Power Tech Corporation out of Canada proposed a uranium mine upstream from the horse sanctuary. And Dayton heard about that, and he got involved. Please don't be apathetic about what's happening, because it's very serious. We don't want to become leukemia capitol of the world. It's going to affect an awful lot of people, not only here, but all through the Black Hills, and all across the plains. They can't avoid polluting the Cheyenne River, and a lot of us live along that Cheyenne, and we'd better be worried. Dayton is our lead petitioner before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission against Power Tech's application to mine uranium within view from here, in the same aquifer of water that Dayton and all his horses live on. And it's going to ruin the water, ruin the horses. What's left? So, since then, three, four years, we've been in this wide open fight against Power Tech. They were scouting for uranium, so they flew over in helicopters, and that'd panic the horses. Even those old horses are scared to death when a helicopter comes by, and they don't ask you, they just come and fly your land, low. It never occurred to me that somebody could come in and destroy the sanctuary. Never knew the mineral rights were for sale, or that they were owned by somebody else. It's called the Split Estate, and it's true across the Western United States. People who live here only own the top part of their land, unless they happen to have bought their mineral rights when they bought the land. Most people didn't. So the government owns what's underneath, or a company can own what's underneath your property, and they have the right to come and mine, mining takes precedence over whatever somebody's doing on the surface of the ground. It's pretty well messed up here in these Black Hills. All the money in the world, and the best of intentions, won't clean up a poisoned aquifer. And such pollution can travel far from the mining areas. Future generations will only see a death scape, instead of a place that has kept its' beauty, since the last ice age. I'm afraid they'll just mine that uranium, pollute the water, and then pull out. Historically, that's what they've done, unfortunately. Edgemont is basically a very small town, that's barely hanging on. There was a uranium mill there which spread radioactive mill tailings, which are basically sand over the whole town. So they're a classic example of a boom and bust mining town. I was the mayor of Edgemont for five and a half years, and this is, I guess, my opportunity to help the community as much as anything. I'm a chemical engineer, I'm an organic rancher, and a uranium miner. We've been in the permitting process for six years, I'm committed to getting the project up and going. This is a operating Incitia uranium mine, just south of here in Crawford, Nebraska. These little white spots are the wells. This is almost like athroscopic mining. I mean, you drill a hole, you go in, you get what you're after, and you leave with the minimum amount of impact to the environment. The mining company can say all they want about controlling everything they do. But they cannot suspend Murphy's Law that things aren't going to go wrong. Frightening, really, and why they're even considering permitting such use, I don't know. It's beyond me. I'm writing editorials, and I'm working very closely with the Sioux Tribe. We're fighting at State Legislature, anyway we can. I'm going to be right there, cowboys fighting with the Indians. I'm being honored by bands of the Sioux Indians, who, they were giving me an Indian name. And I'm tickled to death, it does mean a lot to me, because these are some of my best friends. I want all the relatives, all friends, I want to thank you very much for being here and show your support. I want to name Mr. Dayton Hyde. I'm going to give him an Indian name. Dayton Hyde, Protector of All Ceremonies. Thank you, John, I'm honored. Thank you for that nice reading. Our pleasere. Thank you, Mr. Hyde, welcome to. Glad you're a part of the family. That's turkey feathers. I want to thank everybody here for this great honor. It does mean a lot to me. And I hope that others will continue to support this very spiritual land here. It's up to every person here to keep those miners from digging holes in this land, and take care of this place. Cowboys have hours in the saddle, and there's lots of cowboys that become poets. This is one of my favorites. About a winter wren. Which is a very tiny bird, about as big as your thumb. "Oh hidden singer, in the woods, I long to know thy "name, I fancy such a glorious voice, the plumage "just the same, he jerks his tail up saucily, "no bigger than my thumb, his tiny talent, "king of song, whose music strikes me dumb "a half of century has past since I saw that winter wren, "it's time I went to Michigan to look him up again." I don't think I've ever ceased to be that lonely kid in Northern Michigan. Many a man has loved several women. I loved several places, the ranch in Oregon, the prairies of South Dakota, and the Black Hills. That's one of my regrets, that my Father was never around to know what all his kids became in life. He died early, and when our lives were still forming. There's that dog. I don't know what they are. Doctor just gives them to me, and I take them with a blind faith, if they'll add another few miles to my life. You keep going as long as you can, and make the most of everyday, seven days a week. In fact, when being a cowboy comes to this, when you have to climb a set of stairs to get on a horse. Yee. Oh, man, that feels good. You just don't stop, You just keep going on and looking, and trying to figure out what can make life important, the next step. One old cowboy can do quite a bit. Well, it's up to you to continue to dream. "Times have changed dramatically in the West. "Development's widespread, and the once lonely "vistas are now paved over with the yard to yard housing, "and shopping malls that will never grow an orange, "or an ear of corn. "Though we must never forget the beauty and importance "of our wild horses and their right "to run wild and free. "I can sense this freedom when I watch "bands of Mustangs thundering across the prairie, "haven, for no other reason than the pure joy, "coursing through their veins. "The music of drumming hooves echoes "from ancient rimrocks, then dies in the distance. "I whispered to myself a long remembered line "from John Keats, Ode to a Nightingale. "Fled is that music, do I wake, or sleep?"
