Al-ach ahm buchar! Come, Maldor. I must have strength to open the tomb My people are still scouring the land for the Eye of Braxus They will Find it for me. The legends speak of a new ruler, A young upstart named King Tal. They say he has a knowledge of The Eye, and they say he will share this knowledge with his brother, a nomad cursed to wander the deserts and the forests, A man with power over the animals... And scarred with the mark of the beast. I will command my warriors to bring the young king to me. That, in turn, will bring me his brother, The Beastmaster. When I have them both, I will regain my power and my kingdom. I must have The Eye of Braxus. We shouldn't have left the main road, Korum. You speak, wife, as if there were choices. The Crimson Warriors were after us. But this route will lead us to thieves. A thief would not survive this, hmm? - Father! - Whoa! - Korum! No! - Let her go! - Leave her alone! Father! No! So, hanging man, I survived you and your sword. Definitely not impressed. And I'm Mother! Mother! Bortho! Quit fooling around and search the cart! - I found this! - No! It's just painted wood! Is that all you've got? This worthless piece of junk? It was worth more than gold to my people. - There's nothing worth taking. - Get away from me! - Leave her alone! - You fool boy! Mother! Kill me quickly and be done with it! No. Ruh, enough. Whoa! Oh! Who-- who are you? My friends call me Dar, But you can call me The Beastmaster. You should kill me while you have the chance! We shall meet again, Master of the Beasts. - Come on! Hurry! - Okay. Oh, no. Braxus. - Thank you. - What is this? It is Braxus, an ancient god of our homeland. It was to be an offering to King Tal of Aruk. Korum, he has the Mark of the Beast. You need not fear me. But these woods are dangerous. You should leave. For us, the main road holds even greater danger... From the Crimson Warriors of Lord Agon. Lord Agon? A tyrant who conquered our homeland of Almbeth. - We escaped to seek King Tal. - We heard he was in Acrollam. At the eastern border of his realm, giving audience. King Tal is a just and wise leader. We hoped that he could help free Almbeth from the tyranny of Lord Agon's rule. Without an offering, we won't even be admitted to see him. I'll see that you get an audience. - You know King Tal? - Like a brother. - I'll meet you in Acrollam. - Please, ride with us. You and your, uh, friends would be most welcome. It's better if we travel separately. - They must gone to the Royal Encampment. - No matter. But Korum will seek King Tal's help against us. Let him. By nightfall, the reinforcements will be here. And then it will be too late for young King Tal. We ride! An offering, my king. Thank you... most kindly. Seth. - Your majesty. - All these gifts. I'm beginning to feel a little guilty. The people's tributes come from their hearts, your majesty. Your majesty must learn to accept gifts more graciously. The world is plagued by evil, and I'm stuck on this throne Your majesty does more good on his throne... than all the armies of the world. I should know better than to argue with you. Any more visitors today? King Tal, we have come far to see you. - Our tribute was lost, but--- - I'm sorry, but without a tribute, there cannot be an audience. Perhaps you would accept me as their tribute. Dar! Seth, this calls for a real celebration. - It shall be done, my king. - Yes. But first, you should hear what these people have to say. Thank you, Dar. Lord Agon is a powerful sorcerer. His Crimson Warriors shoot arrows of fire. - He took Almbeth in a day. - Yes, but why? - What do you mean, Seth? - Well, I've been to Almbeth. It has no riches, no natural resources, no strategic value whatsoever. So what did Lord Agon gain by conquering it? Perhaps he seeks something there of value only to a sorcerer. Lord Agon has been searching the stronghold of Braxus. What is this stronghold? The fortress of the ancient god of Braxus, who once ruled Almbeth. If Lord Agon seeks a god's magical object, he could bring evil upon the entire world. - Seth. - Your Majesty. Send runners. Alert our bravest warriors. We leave at dawn to liberate Almbeth. Very well, your majesty. Thank you. Thank you, King Tal. How about it? Will you join us? You have many brave warriors and Seth's wise counsel. I'd only be in the way. And you have amazing powers, Dar. And if you join us, we're sure to win. - My place is in the wilderness. - Why do you keep turning away? This mark sets me apart from other men. My destiny lies elsewhere. Come. I have something to share with you. Quiet, old friend. I'll feed you later. Before he died, our father gave this me. He made swear to protect it. I never discovered it's purpose, but I did discover this. Here. It'll be safer if we share the responsibility, and it'll remind you of the bond between us. I will guard it with my life. - Good-bye, brother. - Good-bye, brother. Who goes there? Reveal yourselves at once! Take cover! Get down! Let fly! Stop grumbling. They wouldn't have let you stay at the celebration anyway. You can be pretty frightening sometimes. You know that? And you two, I suppose you're disappointed I didn't let you steal the king's crown. Well, look. See that? He gave me that, and you can't have it. That's odd. We've been traveling half the night, and the light from the fires of King Tal's camp are still burning bright. Sherak, fly to King Tal's camp. Hurry. Hurry, Sherak. Tal! Where's my brother? What happened to the king? They came shooting arrows of fire. The guards didn't have a chance. - Who came? - It was Lord Agon's Crimson Warriors. I thought they'd come for us. They took the king instead. What would Lord Agon want with my brother? I don't know, but my husband nearly died trying to protect him. I should never have left him. I'm responsible for this. What have you done with the king? You are in no position to ask questions. You and your whole army aren't gonna stop me. - I'm gonna free the king. - I doubt it. Your king is with the main contingent, a full day's ride ahead of us, and you aren't going anywhere. Wait. Do not fire, brother. Keep moving, old man. I am a wandering worshipper of Demish, the god of peace. You'll meet your god if you do not clear away. When we show mercy, we are touched by Demish himself. - Kill him! - He's a holy man. Hear my words, and feel the god of Demish touch your brow. Seth! - Would you mind helping, Dar? - With pleasure! Ruh! Huh! Hyah! Move! Huh! Huh! Huh! Hyah! Huh! - It's been a long time, Seth. - Too long. This will keep them from finding us. When they took the king I was knocked unconscious. I've been following them ever since. - What are you doing here? - I'm gonna rescue Tal. Dar, what happened last night involves more than your brother's life. And you're involved now whether you like it or not. Must you always be in such a hurry? - What is it? - Don't touch it. Dar! Dar! Close it! Come on, or we'll lose 'em in this fog. I think that's what they had in mind. Hyah! Huh! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Welcome to Almbeth, King Tal. I'm Lord Agon. I trust you had a pleasant journey. - What do you want with me? - With you, your majesty? Nothing. It's what you have that I want. At last, it's mine. Lock him up! Come. How far do you think we've come? I don't know. What direction do you think we're headed in? I don't know. Toward Almbeth? Ya think toward Almbeth? I don't know. - Then we're lost. - That I know. There's only one way out of this fog, and that's above it. Oh, and do you fancy yourself some mighty storm god, that you can soar above the clouds? No, but I know someone who can. Sherak! Fly, Sherak. Show us the way. That way. I don't know. After all my searching, Maldor, the Tomb of Braxus... will at last be opened to me. What? By all the beasts in the pit, this is only part of The Eye! Oh, conserve your strength, my lord. Sorcery does drain you so. I... grow weaker by the hour. Behind that door lies the solution to my problem. I must open that door. Well, I'm only a worn-out warlock whose powers have deserted him, but it does occur to me that Lord Tal might not be telling us all he knows. I need more strength for the task ahead. Really? Uh, so soon? I need a younger one this time, young and full of life. But your lordship has already used up... the more, uh, lively citizens, and I'm afraid the supply of prisoners is growing very short. Then make more arrests. I'll sacrifice everyone in Almbeth if need be. And what if our young king does not know... the whreabouts of the Eye's missing part? What-- what then? Prepare another sacrifice. Go. Uh, but, uh-- Now... which way to Almbeth? - I don't know. - I thought you'd made this journey before. Yes, but never through a supernatural fog. This Lord Agon must be a powerful sorcerer indeed. Listen, we'll wait for nightfall, for the rising of the Great Star of Jeralla, so she may guide us straight and true through this land. or... we could just start moving. - But we don't know the way. - This is the only way. Unless you want to go through that fog again. Dar, we're lost! He never listens. Mercenaries. Ruh, away. But who's the woman? Could be their prisoner. - Let's find out. - No, wait. I thought Beastmaster... doesn't concern himself with affairs of men, or are affairs of women a different matter? For all we know, they might not be friendly. Greetings, friends. Where do you travel? That unfriendly enough for ya? Here we go again. Ruh! Away. - What are you doin'? - You all right? Oh, you idiot! What do you mean, scaring off my men? Dar, you rescued her. Now who's gonna rescue you? What are you laughing at, you overblown ox? - We were only trying to help. - Help? It took me weeks to recruit those four. If you'd chosen better warriors, they wouldn't have run away. - What do you need armed men for, anyway? - None of your business. Pardon us. We are strangers seeking a route to Almbeth. We were hoping you might be able to point us the way. Do you really think I'd help you after what you just did? - Are you in a position to refuse us? - Don't fool yourself. I am Shada, a Keshite warrior of the first rank. I could easily handle the two of you. Um, three of us. No one in his right mind wants to go to Almbeth. I should know. I'm from there. Well, I must go there. They've taken my brother prisoner. He doesn't have a chance in hell of getting out alive. Wait. This is no laughing matter. His brother is King Tal of Aruk. - He was kidnapped by Lord Agon - Lord Agon? I'm responsible for his capture. You are indeed brave to face such peril for a brother. There's something about you that I find very attractive. Come. Almbeth lies to the west. Dar, you-- you're not gonna trust her! She knocked you down. She knocked us both down. The last of the prisoners, Lord Agon. Hmph. Not much to choose from, I'm afraid. That one will do. Al-ach ahm buchar! Come, Maldor. King Tal must be lonely. It's time we paid him a visit. What are you doing? I grew cold. You were warm. The amulet is gone. Where is it? - You took it. - No! No! I swear! I-- I didn't! You little bandits. Nothing's ever safe from you two. Is it? Come on. Bring it here. Bring it to me. Ruh. Up. Here. You can wear it, but you can't keep it. There. That should keep it safe from prying paws... and hands. How do they know to obey your commands? Well, they're part of me. Ruh is my strength, and Sherak is my eyes... and these two, they're my cunning. You... are an extraordinary man. You're like these animals. Wild. Untamed. Free. Where's the other half of this amulet? I don't know. It was given to me by my father, King Zed. It was in one piece when he gave it to you. You must have removed the other half. - Who else would have done that? - That's how he gave it to me. You're lying. Your majesty must be so uncomfortable in those chains. The Shroud of Agony will rip the answer from your brain. The process is long and painful. Tell me now and spare yourself. - Never - Oh, you will, whether you like it or not. All we can do is wait. Shrouds of Agony take forever. Each time, the rejuvenation wears off more quickly. But I must hold on until the Eye of Braxus is complete. Hmm? She's gone. Well, that's what I get for trusting people. No, that's what you get for trusting her. Well, at least she didn't get the amulet. - Couldn't, more likely. - So, you're finally awake. - Where have you been? - Scouting. I found a direct route to Almbeth I'll lead you to it. Then we'll part ways. Are you glad to be rid of us so soon? No, but I have my own road to travel. You know, I can't believe that we're gonna trust her to lead us to Almbeth. I say we keep her with us until Almbeth is within sight. I could have run off anytime, but I stayed. The road will lead you to Almbeth in a half-a-day's march. Do you want me to lead you? Yes. Don't be an idiot, all right? I mean of all the people to trust--- Go on. Go on. You-- you never listen. There. The route to Almbeth. What? What, that jackal path? You can't be serious. Almbeth is beyond this jungle. My way lies to the north. Look out for yourself, wild one. Ahem. Not in a hurry to get to Almbeth, Seth? Of course. Then why do you walk so slowly? Because this is not the route to Almbeth. Listen. What is it? Drums. I hear it. There are Mountain People nearby. Savages Well, these tribesmen are as stealthful as the wind. They could be all around us. You worry too much. And you never listen! Ruh! - We could die fighting. - No! No! They've got Ruh. This is horrible. Shambali tribesmen. - Can you speak to them? - I only know a few words. Tell them we mean no harm. I'll try my best, my very best. Just let me do the talking. Uh... Ah. Seth! What'd ya say? Wait! Seth! Good work. You can keep the cat. All I want is what's around his neck. Farewell, Dar. I thought you said you could speak their language. - I told you I only knew a few words. - All insults, apparently. You were the one that trusted that woman. I told you I didn't think that was the right path. - It just keeps getting worse. - Soon we'll cross the dark waters... from which there is no return. We'll cross over to the great realm beyond. Our time has come. My time hasn't come. So we meet again, Master of the Beasts. You. Why? You spared my life. Now we're even. My thanks. Besides, I hate these mud-caked savages even worse than I hate you. They came after us last night, until a woman called them off. Was she a blonde, dressed as a warrior? Aye, that's the one. You know her? And if we do? Then you should choose your friends more wisely. - She works for Lord Agon - How do you know this? Agon's been hiring mercenaries for months. He's looking for an amulet--- Something called The Eye of Braxus Then that's why they've captured.... Ruh... Kodo, Podo, come. Our score's settled, Master of the Beasts. Next time, I may have to kill you. Next time, I'll lead. Hurry, Seth. Ruh's life is at stake. Hah! Ahh! They're not so brave once the cat is out of the bag. The amulet. It's gone. She couldn't have gone very far. Ruh, come! Sherak! Come, old friend. - Give me the amulet. - Ow! - Give me the amulet! - You're breaking my arm. I'll break it. - Why? - I had no choice. It was either that or become one of Lord Agon's sacrifices. Sacrifices? Agon's sorcery is powerful, but it has aged him. He requires the life essence of others. He sacrificed nearly half of Almbeth to maintain his youth. You needn't worry. I won't run away again. Not this time. You were right, Seth. This time, we keep her until Almbeth is within sight. That was my plan. Come on. See how the Shroud of Agony pulls the truth from his mind. I've seen this man before, mi'lord He followed us when we took King Tal. He had wild animals that obeyed his commands. - The Beastmaster! - I thought he was only a legend. Send forth your best men. Find him. Hurry! Time is running out. There. Almbeth. Is there another way in besides those gates? Not unless you're prepared to scale those cliffs. Release me now. I did my end of the bargain. Not yet. - We've gotta find a way over that wall. - No, we can't be fools. We can't go barging in there, not with that amulet. The amulet? Yes. Listen, Lord Braxus was the god of darkness. He had a third eye and all the powers of hell at his command. They called him Lord of the Pit. Whatever Lord Agon seeks in the stronghold of Braxus is bound to be evil. That amulet's got something to do with it. We'll have to make sure he doesn't get his hands on it. I don't even see how we can get into the city. I think I do. If they're heading for Almbeth, perhaps we could swing in with 'em. Shada-- Shada. Shada! Shada! - Don't move. - Can't you make it back off? No. She defends her nest. Easy, girl. Easy. We mean you no harm. No harm. Whoa. Easy. Easy. Easy! Easy. Sweet snake. Sweet snake. Go. - You okay? - You risked your life for me. - Did you expect me to leave you there? - You still have use for me then? - You're free. - You said before you needed me. No. I need someone I can trust. Dar, is that a giant? Welcome to Madam Mystico & Company, feats of magical and acrobatic skills. Madam Mystico handles the magic. I'm Bey. I do the acrobatics. How may I be of service to you? - We seek passage into Almbeth. - We are heading there to amuse Lord Agon. A real pig with no sense of humor. But that's just my opinion. - Perhaps we might join you. - You're most welcome. Unfortunately, it's not my show. You'll have to ask Madam Mystico. Please. Come. No, no. These gypsies are a touchy lot. It will take a supple tongue to convince them. What do you have in mind? Let me handle it. I'll have them eating out of our hands. Like the Shambalis? Careful, Seth. Presenting the greatest conjurer of the age, whose feats of magic have amazed all the crowned heads of the five realms. Madam Mystico. Well, well, well. This is a surprise. - What's the matter with you? - Uh, - we gotta get out of here right now - Why? - I know this woman. - Well, fine. No, you don't understand. We left under less-than-favorable circumstances. - So now's your chance to make it right. - No, Dar. Let me explain. - She's a witch. - She looks all right to me. You don't understand. She's a real... witch. - She casts spells. - Talk to her. Go on. Talk to her. Talk to her! So you still remember me after all these years, Seth. How could I forget? Oh, and you're still upset with me. Why shouldn't I be, after what you did? You left me! Don't you remember? Morgana, it was, uh--- It was over between us. I loved you as no other woman could have. I would have devoted my life to you. You turned me into a... rabbit. It was only for a little while, and it was to punish you... for breaking my heart. Ahem. Maybe we should let them talk. We're of two different worlds, Morgana. It never would've worked. Are you honestly saying... that this wouldn't work? It's good to see you. Take me to Almbeth. I have an audience with Lord Agon. You are The Beastmaster. The one who commands the creatures of the wild. Take me with you. - What? - I want to travel with you... and share in your adventures. - Adventures? - Yes! Everyone knows how you defeated Ma'ax. How you help the innocent victims of tyranny. - People sing songs about you. - Songs? I don't want to spend the rest of my life... jumping around to amuse these fat noblemen. I can help you. I have skills. I'm no hero. I live in the wilderness. I do what I have to to survive. If you're smart, you'll stay away from me. No, you won't get rid of me that easily. They should be through talking. Ahem. - Oh. - Uh, you, uh-- you are an enchantress. You haven't forgotten any of your tricks. Your friend has put me in an exceptionally good mood. - What is you request? - I must get into Almbeth with my animals. Oh, tricky, tricky, tricky. You're a hunted man. Lord Agon's Crimson Warriors are searching everywhere for you. But can you do it? Of course I can. Are you prepared? We are. Abracadabra Kalamazoo. It was a joke. O' Light of Transformation Make me a vessel for your power. Ruh. Morgana, will you please stop showing off? What are you doing? Gentlemen, he's all yours. You witch! You'll pay for this! Now you will let us in after nightfall, won't you? But you are to wait until you are summoned. Surely such a brave, good-looking warrior... such as you... wouldn't mind bending the rules a little. Of course not. Anything for you. The world would be such a dull place without men. Whoa. You she-devil. You realize what you've done? I've done exactly what he asked. The guards will take him to the city. The animals will travel with us. You just delivered Dar into the clutches of Lord Agon. The Crimson Warriors would have gotten him one way or another. At least now he has a chance. Bey. Break camp. - We enter the city tonight. - At once, mistress. Do you realize that Dar has the Eye of Braxus, the very thing Lord Agon is after? I'm aware of that. Do you think it was mere coincidence that I happened to be here? I'm going to destroy that thing. Why didn't you destroy it when had a chance? Because it has to be reunited in order to nullify it's power. Let us pray that we get to The Eye... before Lord Agon has a chance to use it. Come on. So this is the mighty Beastmaster. What a fine specimen. Pity we couldn't use him for your rejuvenation, Lord Agon. Yes, indeed it is. But then, I wouldn't want to be defiled by the Mark of the Beast. Careful, my impetuous friend. The more you struggle, the sooner you'll die. And I can assure you that the creatures down there... are quite immune to your powers. Sooner or later, that rope will break, and then you won't be around anymore to interfere with my plans. Damn your plans. What have you done with the king? Ah, King Tal has been in the Shroud of Agony since last night. He'll be dead within the hour. Careful. The rope. Farewell, Beastmaster. Sorcerer! You harm the king, and I promise you, you'll learn the real meaning of agony. From whom? You? You're a failure. You're a mistake. You're a pathetic freak of nature. I'm doing the world a favor by removing you from it. Come. Must must reunite The Eye. I guess I should have listened to Seth. Dar! What are you doin' here? I came to ask for your forgiveness. Done. You've paid me back. So this is the stronghold of Braxus, eh? What a pigsty! Dar. You're alive. My animals. - Where are they? - Doesn't anybody say "please anymore? I told you I'd get them safely into the citadel. - Did Lord Agon get the amulet? - He did. Then we have to stop him. Before it's too late. - First, we rescue King Tal. - No. No. Dar, this is much more important. His life is in danger. I'll get the king. You stay here. Where does Lord Agon keep his prisoners? - The dungeons. - Lead on. It's up to us then to get the amulet. First we have to get past the Crimson Warriors. Must you always be so gloomy? What are you gypsies doing here? No one summoned-- - You! - Uh-oh. - Friend of yours? - Attack! T-t-to your right! Your right! Now, it's just you and me. Wait, wait, wait. Can't we deal with this with a little more class? - Such as? - Such as this! Sleep peacefully, brothers. - What holds them together? - A spell perhaps. It seems there's always some spell attached to these mystical amulets. I would have heard about it. Well, if your lordship would allow me, perhaps-- I have had some experience with these things-- wielding talismans and casting spells... with the best of them. No, I'm not bitter about my-- my fate. Ah! There. The Eye of Braxus is complete. I grow weaker still. I must have strength to open the tomb. I must have another sacrifice. Oh, dear. I'm afraid there simply are no prisoners left. I mean, the old man died, and the woman was killed when she was trying to-- to escape. Find someone. I don't care who. I ust have more strength. He seems to think I can just snap my fingers and find young bodies. Ruh. Guard. Right there. Tal. Tal! Think these would help? - Better than your ferrets, huh? - Where'd you get those? From the guard. He's sleeping like a baby. You see? Even the Beastmaster needs a little help now and then. All right, you helped. Now leave, while there's still time. Are you crazy? You need me. We're a team. Let's go. It's all right, Tal. We're gonna take you home. - No! We must stop Agon. - Seth can stop Agon. - If you won't help, then leave me here. - What? With whatever strength I have left, I will fight Lord Agon. You're in no condition to fight. Come. Ruh. Ruh, come. - What's the matter with you? - They know what you must do. - Are you strong enough to carry him? - I'm strong enough to carry you. Take him to safety. Thank you, my friends. Thank you for showing me my destiny. Let's go pay Lord Agon a visit. I knew he was a hero. Knew it even before he knew it. Now. Bring him this way. Gently, you clods. Don't bruise the boy. Go ahead. Help the others. I'll be all right here. You sure? I'll be back. - Now you're going to die. - This'll slow you down. Oh! No! Oh, you fiendish brute! You don't happen to know any magic, do you? No. I'm sorry. Oh, well. Back to the old-fashioned way. Now, miserable whelp, you will give me the strength to complete my task. Al-ach ahm buchar! Agon! So, the freak still lives. - Look to youself, Agon. - When I open that door. Youth and infinite power will be mine. No. You defy nature, and it will destroy you. Sherak! Call off your beast. Ruh. No. Throw down your sword. Don't kill him. I'll have that pleasure myself, when all the powers of hell are mine. Whatever's behind that door cannot save you, sorcerer. Ignorant savage! It is written that he who opens the tomb... will receive the powers of Braxus himself. And that person... shall be me. For countless ages, I have waited for the one... who would return my Eye to me... and release me from this captivity. Behold... the spirit of Braxus. You seek reward for returning The Eye, and you shall have it! My powers shall be yours. - And your body shall be mine! - No! No! No! No! No! No! No-o-o-o-o-o! After untold centuries, I, Braxus, Lord of the Pit, have returned! No! No, I-I had nothing to do with Lord Agon. I-I-I was against the whole plan from the start! Die, pest! Wretched tools of your master's greed! Begone! I, Braxus, will rule again. You mere mortals have no power against me. No force will take me. My evil will prevail! At last I can free my people. They will never inhabit the darkness again. Together we shall rule. Children of the Pit, the time of your release is at hand! No earthly weapon will kill that monster. We're gonna have to use our wits to beat him. That just happens to be my specialty. No. - Stay here. - Come, my little friends, and we shall spread hellfire across the land once more. Not so fast, Braxus. - You have to deal with me first. - That should be an easy task. Your aim is poor for someboy with three eyes. Die, mortal! Come on, Braxus. Can't the god of darkness kill a mere human? You pathetic insect! I'll shred your flesh! My Eye! Where is my Eye? Where is it? Where? My powers are not complete without The Eye! Miserable beasts! Ruh, wait. I'll see you burn in eternity in the pit! Not without The Eye, Braxus. Give it to me! I can reward you, give you all the riches you wish. Riches? Promise? - I swear it. Yes. - Done. Roast in hell, Braxus! Burn, you old lizard! - We did it. - Yes. - I mean, you have to admit I helped. - Yes, you helped. - And we're a good team, huh? - We're not a team. - I thought you could use some help. - Where's Dar? - Gone to stop Lord Agon. - What finally convinced him? - His animals. - That is good. I only thought that by now, you-- All right, that's fine. I can have adventures without you. I don't need you. I can look out for myself. And this thing is disgusting. My Eye! Give it to me! The Eye! Dar, destroy it. Bey! Bey! Bey! Give me your hand! Let's... get King Tal... and go home. Yes. Oh, he's a strong boy. Bye-bye. Ruh. Come. Hey! We are not finished, Beastmaster. Our paths shall cross again. This potion... will get you well by the time you reach Aruk. Mmm. I feel better already. Uh, Dar. Lord Agon is only one of the evils you must face. I will fight the others too. You don't know how long I've waited to hear that. Seth! Your majesty? Your services are no longer required. But, your majesty-- You have been a wise and loyal counselor, but now Dar needs your guidance and experiences in the ways of men. Your majesty, he never listens. Be a good mentor to him and fight bravely at his side. Well, I suppose somebody should look after you. Uh, Dar, I understand some barbarian warlords... have recently invaded the mystical city of Jaharta. What say we travel there and make some trouble? That sounds like a fine plan. If he doesn't get us lost again. Dar, learn from Seth. - He needs advice. - I will... when he's right. Are you going with us? People of Almbeth have suffered much. They need a defender. I can do some good for them. I learned that from you. Then Almbeth will have a good protector. I will never forget you. Ride well, Shada. I will see the king safely to the border.
