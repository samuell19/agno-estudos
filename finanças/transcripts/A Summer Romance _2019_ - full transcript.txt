Good afternoon, ladiesand gentlemen of the board. If there's no questions, let's begin. We start... here... and end here, at one of the most lavishand spectacular resorts in all of North America... A retreatwhere the overstressed can relax, refresh, and recharge, and America's premier resortfrom The Belmont Corporation, and our new partners, Global Enterprises. And we have found a ranchjust outside Bighorn, Montana that we feel is ideally suitedto this latest venture... A beautiful, 2,500-acre spread, with some of the most spectacular views you'll ever see. Now, I fly to Montanain the morning to convince the ownersto sell to us, so let's hope that I don't leavemy powers of persuasion behind. Ashley? Todd? Anything to add? Uh, well, the good news is, the propertyis three months in arrears, so we think the ownerwill be ripe to make a deal. Once the deal is closed, we hope to break groundimmediately with a projected completiontime frame of 34 months. Now, this is the first, but hopefully not the last, Belmont/Global joint venture... So we're all determinedto do this right. Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your timeand your attention, but that's enough shop talk, let's go home. So what's the lateston the owner? Walker? Sam Walker. Everything's under control. I spoketo the foreman yesterday. They're expecting you tomorrow. Good. They're under pressureand we're the white knight. Hopefully, they'll justtake our money and leave us the keyto the ranch. That's the plan. Check out my poster! Oh, it's so pretty. Thank you. You're really good. How's it coming? My little artist. Wow.-Good job, Annie-girl! I thinkit's your best poster yet. And your last one for a while. You've got chores. Aw, Mom. Five more minutes? I'm sorry. Say so long. Okay. So long, guys. Good luck with your posters. Thanks very much. Thank you. So... I met with Hal at the bank. How'd it go? Hal and your fathergo way back. All the way back to grade school. So, trust me, he'll leave no stone unturnedwhen it comes to helping out. You don'thave to worry about that. We've got coloring to do. Yes, ma'am. This projectis the primary reason Global wants to merge with us, and we need everythingto move quickly, which is my job. Your job is to make sure that everythingflows smoothly here until I get back. Think you two can handle that? Yes, sir.-Yes, sir. Good. And Richard... Good luck. I don't believe in luck. I believe in negotiations. I've gotta go. I will be in touchwith you later. Ah-hah! Good evening, Mr. Belmont.-Good evening. What's the score? We're up two to onein the sixth, sir. All right. All right. Who's on the mound? Tanaka. Tanaka? He's pitchinga one-hitter tonight. Sounds good. Oh... that reminds me. For you and your daughter. I won't be needing themtomorrow night. Are you kidding me? Box seats! Thank you so much, sir. You're a real stand-up guy. You deserve it. Tell Sasha I said hello. I sure will. Have a good evening, sir.

Hi there, Willie. Howdy! Here, let metake your horse for you. Thank you. It's you. Sorry, I saw youon the road there, earlier. You're not from around here, are you? No. New York. Just arrived. Ahh. You're the guywho flew in right as soon as they wereclosing down the airport. You know about that? It's a small town. Word travels fast. Richard. Richard Belmont. Here to see the Walker Ranch and a Mr. Sam Walker. You know Sam Walker? Maybe you couldtell me about him. Oh, boy. Well, I know Sam, all right. I'll take it from here, Willie. We'll be right back.-Uh, but he's my ride. Go easy on him, Sam. Wait, wait, wait. You're Sam Walker? TheSam Walker? Technically, it's Samantha, but everyone calls me Sam. And what about you? Just Richard? There's no nickname? Ricardo? Richie? Rick? Just Richard. Not sure I can trust a manwithout a nickname. Anyway, you came to see the ranch, so why don't I give youa bird's-eye view? You're supposed to follow me, "Just Richard." Oh. Right. You're a developer, right? That's right. Bet you want to builda big resort. Maybe a championshipgolf course, a lake with sailboatsand canoes. Well, actually, I picturedtwo championship golf courses and a shopping mallin between 'em. Just so you know, I'm open to hearing your offer, but I have every intentionof keeping the ranch. Well, our development wouldbring commerce to the region, keep the shops openand thriving, pave the wayfor new small businesses. And our offer's very generous, with a bonus built in forearly departure of the property. Are you kidding me? We just met, and you're alreadyshowing me the door. I just... Allow me to present my offer. Shh. Shh, shh. Just listen. Close your eyes. What am I supposed to hear? The sound of silence. Oh, great. Now I've got a signal. Sorry. I've got to take this. Mm. Todd. Hey. I'm with Walker now. I'm looking at the ranch. It's beautiful. I'll call youwhen I get settled. Sam! Thanks, Willie. Not a problem. Think I got to throwthese shoes out. No. Just a little spitand an old rag, and they'll shine up fine. Right. Hey, can I call you later, when I get a place to stay? You don't havea place to stay? Well, no, according to my ride, everything's booked up. The, uh...-Festival. Right. Sounds likeyou're in a pickle. We have a guest cottageat the ranch. It's not the Ritz-Carlton, but you can stay if you like. You're offering to let mestay at the ranch? That's howwe do things here. If a person's stuck, they always havea place to stay. Besides... it's the least I can doafter ruining your shoes. Well, thank you. That's very kind. You do knowthat's not gonna stop me from trying to convince youto sell me your ranch, right? Oh, that's whyl want you there. So I can keep an eye on ya. Okay then. Let's go, JR. "JR"? That's short for "Just Richard." There. Now you got a nickname. Tch. Get in, JR. I love this ranch. She'll do what's best. If there's one thing thatl know about Sam Walker, it's her unparalleled driveto do what's right. Mm. Speak of the devil.-Oh! Well, hello there. Buck, Catherine. This is Richard Belmontfrom New York. Mm.-But you can call him JR. Okay.-Nice to meet you. Richard. Nice to meet you, Richard. Welcome to Walker Ranch. Our daughter'saround here somewhere. Annie! Coming! There she is.-There she is. Annie, this is JR.-Hi, Annie. You all live here? Yep. Home, sweet home. Buck and Catherinekeep the place running, and I would be lostwithout them. Anyway, let meshow you to your digs. I'll take that. Nice to meet you.-Likewise. Stays pretty quiet out hereat night, just some wolves and coyotes. Wolves and coyotes? Don't worry. Simba will scare them off. And who is Simba? Oh, our resident mountain lion. You havea resident mountain lion? Relax. He'll probably leave you alone. "Probably?" So this is you. Will there beturndown service? And chocolates on the pillows? Yeah, the housekeeper'son vacation, so you'll have to clean upafter yourself. Oh, I'm very clean. I'm sure you are. So the cottage is small, but cozy. You've got a fridge, microwave, no TV, no phone. Everything you need, and nothin' you don't. Oh, uh... Where do I get signal? Phone serviceis a bit spotty out here. Best placeis behind the barn. Okay, perfect. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Oh, uh, Sam? How is delivery around here? Delivery? Are you talking foals, calves, or babies? Food. I don't want to inconvenienceyour chef. Supper's served at 6:00. I'll alert the "chef" that you'll be joining us. Oh, Sam? Don't I need a key? Nobody locks their doorsaround here. Oh... Oh! Uh... Didn't realize we didn'tdress for dinner. Sorry. Wow. Carbs. Well, country life meansworking hard in the day and celebrating good foodin the evening. Thanks. So, Sam, since the airport'sgonna be closed for a few days, maybe you'd liketo take Richard shopping. That would be great, actually. I have to pick upa couple of personal items. I only packed for one night. Mm. That is delicious. I haven't had a home-cooked meallike this in... Actually, I don't think I've ever hada home-cooked meal like this. Catherine, you've outdone yourself. Oh! Well, there's plenty, as you can see, but Sam did the cooking tonight. Thank you. From the chef. Mm. Mm-hmm. JR? Mom says you do business? That's right. I'm planning to startmy own business someday. Oh, yeah? What kind? I don't know. As long as it's with horses. I love horses. Maybe you can help me. Well, yeah. I'd love to. Why don't we haveyour people get in touch with my people, and we'll set a meeting. Okay. Who are my people? We are, honey. So, Richard. Speaking of business... Sam tells us you'd liketo buy the ranch. Uh, well... my company does have plansto invest in Bighorn's future, and your ranch is a big pieceof that puzzle. I told JR I wouldlisten to his offer, but that we have every intentionof keeping our ranch. Mm. Sam's got this ideashe's kicking around. Hush. I'm keeping itunder my hat. Okay. I see. Well, we're delightedto have you, Richard, whatever the reason. Thank you. Of course, while you're here, you will have to followthe house rule. What house rule? Well, we don't toleratefreeloaders at Walker Ranch, so JR will have to pullhis own weight. That sounds fair. Great. You'll do the dishes tonight. Ha. Nice! Want some food? There you go. It tickles. You wanna try? Uh, no. I'm good here. Oh. He probably won't bite. Oh, good. "Probably." I think it tickles. Come on. Give me your hand. Uh... Just relax. All right, all right. Okay. Okay.-Now make it flat. There you go. Annie! Time for bed! Coming, Mom! 'Night, Sam.'Night, Dad. Okay, be there in a second to give you a kiss goodnight, okay, Junebug? Don't forget to show JRthe lightning bugs! I won't.Sweet dreams, Annie-girl. Goodnight, JR! 'Night, Annie. Well... I best be following. Lightning bugs, huh? It's about time. Lightning bugs? You've never heardof lightning bugs? Well, I-I've heard of them. I've just neverseen them in person. You do a good jobfeeding the horse, I'll show youthe lightning bugs. Deal. Hey, uh, hey... All right. You're not gonna eat me, right? That's not so bad. Hey! I got this. So how long's the ranchbeen in your family? Four generations. Dad should've sold it, but he's stubborn. And he loved this land. The ranch was his life. When he died, the remaining 2,500 acres, and the mountain of debtthat came with them, passed on to me. According to Dad, the land was important, but the code was paramount. The code? "The Cowboy Code." I didn't knowthere was such a thing. Oh, yes. There are four pillars. The first is to live each daywith courage. Courage. I like that. What's the second? I think one's enough for now. Ah. I see how it is. Sam. Are you giving me your number? Not quite. In the interest ofliving each day with courage... there's our offer. I think you'll find there'senough there to start over. I don't want to start over. I want to start fresh. Well? I don't see anything. Wait for it. Wow... There must be thousands of 'em. I've never seenanything like it. I'm surprisedyou've never seen them before. They're a lot more commonin your part of the country. Maybe they're afraidto come into the city. Too much traffic. They're rare here... which makes thisall the more special. Seems like there'sa lot of things around here that are rare and special. Welcome to Montana. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it. Sam? Hey, Larry! How's Megan and the kids? Oh, everybody's doing great. Believe it or not, Megan and I are coming upon our 10th anniversary. Really?-Yeah. Oh! That's hard to believe. I remember your first dance. At our wedding? Sadie Hawkins. Seventh grade. You've got an excellent memory. I'm gonna put thison your tab, right? Thanks, Larry. No trouble at all. I know you're good for it. And why don't you come upfor dinner? I know the whole gangwould love to see you. Thank you. I will. Yeah? All right. Take care now. You too. Sam. Hi, Buck. Looks like JR slept inthis morning. Sure does appear that way. I really like him. Don't you, Buck? Seems likea nice enough fella. He's trying to buy our homeand send us packing. Aside from that fact. Good morning. Good morning, Richard. Morning. So, uh, ranch lifetypically starts at sun-up. You know that, right? I do now. Well, how'd you sleep, JR? Best night of sleepl've had in a long time. Actually slept, which is unusual for me. Mm. Good morning, Annie. Good morning. This is for you. And-And what do I do with this? Oh, it's for pullingyour weight around here. Oh. You know, I was hopingto catch a ride into town later, maybe do some shopping. Well, the man could use a hat. I have a meeting at the bank. You can tag along, if you like. The bank? You know. Talk about the thing. Oh, right. The thing. Hey, Sam, maybe later you can show JR the ranchup close. Hmm? I'd like that. Do you ride? Once, at summer camp. I was nine. Oh! Great. You can ride Rocky. Don't worry, JR. Rocky's a real sweetheart. He probably won't throw you. Oh... great. I've known Buck my whole life. Catherine, almost as long. I introduced them, and I was actually in the roomwhen Annie was born. That sounds like family. Yeah, they are. We have a saying in Bighorn. There are no neighbors, only family. I like that. Well, hello, Samantha. Good to see ya. You too, Maryann. Who's your friend? He's just visiting. From New York. Oh! Right. The pilot who flew in just before the airport closed. Maryann Moore. Bighorn mayor. Richard Belmont. Stranded pilot. You go by "Richard"? No... No nickname? That's what I said. Well, okay. Huh. See youat Summer Fest, Sam? I'll be there. He's not too shabbyin the looks department. She's got my vote. Sorry. She's termed out. Ready to pull your weightagain, JR? Mind doing some shoppingwhile I'm at the bank? Not at all. Great. So, Hal, what do you thinkof my idea? I knowthere are still a few details that need to be ironed out, but I thinkit's got potential. Yeah, I thinkit's real interesting. Now, naturally, all the small-business loans need to go through the businessdevelopment department at the main office. My authority hereis pretty much limited to farm equipmentand insurance loans. But I'm always happy to help, which brings me to... Bighorn Bank and Trust'sbusiness planning packet. That'll teach youhow to write a business plan, and things like, uh, market analysis and financial projections, how to implementa management team, et cetera. Oh, and you'll also need to apply for the necessarylicenses and permits. You'll needto open a business account. And do you have an LLC yet? 'Cause that's also somethingyou ought to get on. You know, I can set upan appointment for you, if you like. No, no, that's okay, I think I'd like to look theseover first. Thank you so muchfor your time, Hal. Oh, uh, do you want meto walk you out? No, no. I'm all right.Thanks. Hey. Hey, Lonnie. What's wrong? What? The bank? The ranch? Hi, JR. Hey. This is everythingthat was on the list. Great. Thank you. Uh, JR, this is Lonnie Lawson, our sheriff. We grew up together. Richard Belmont. You do realize, whenyou crossed the street just now, that you were jaywalking, right? Jaywalking? Just kidding. I'm sure that jaywalking'san artform back in NYC. You're the stranded pilot. My reputation precedes me. Well, I needto head back to work. See you at the festival, Sam? Mm-hmm. Sure thing. You know, if we're goingon a trail ride, you got to at leastlook like a cowboy. Come on. Please don't make melook like a cowboy. Uh, Sam, the groceries?

Leaves here a greenhorn, and comes back a cowboy. All right, let's not get carried away. I think you look very handsome. Well, thank you, Catherine. He does.-Yes. Darn tootin'. All ready! Are you sure you've ridden? Uh, might needa little refresher. On which part? All of it. See, now, everyone, we ask 'em if they can ride, and they always saythey can ride... until they get in the saddleand start sliding out of it. You want to show himhow it's done, Annie-girl? All right. Now you stand beside your mount, like this. Put both reinsin your left hand, with a little tuft of mane. Keep the right rein tight, so he doesn't swing awaywhen you get on. Turn the stirrupso the fender lies flat, lift your left foot in and push up with your right leg. Lookin' good up there, cow girl. All right, let's get you down. See, JR? It's easy. Now it's your turn. Oh, yeah. Okay. All right. My turn. Oh, it's-it's...-Like this... ...The other side. Right. Good start. Okay, reins and... mane, or something like that, and left leg lift, then... and then we're up. Uh... yep. Okay. All right. We're up. Okay. Okay. Okay, all right... Ahh... Not bad!-Hey. This feels pretty goodup here, actually. You ready? Ready. Go easy on JR. He's new. And we like him. So none of that throwing stuff. Wait. Thro... "Throwing stuff"? Come on, city-slicker. Okay. [Sam We'll be backby supper, Annie-girl. Okay, Sam. Have fun, JR! Uh-huh. Bye, Annie. Oh, yeah. He's totally gonnaslide right out of that saddle. Wow, even the airis different out here. And quiet! No noise from the city. What was it like, growing up where you did? Well, it had its advantages. Even went campinga couple times, upstate. Probably pretty tameto you. You know, that horse suits you. Yeah? Maybe I was a cowboyin another life. Yeah, maybe. I think we should cool off. ♪ ...Just give me time ♪ ♪ Driving too faston those dotted lines ♪ ♪ Those memories... ♪ Why don't youtake your boots off, get in the stream? Well, I think I'm okay here. The water's warm. You sure about that? Move it, cowboy. All right. I guess I'm going in. While we're young. I'm working on it. Cut me some slack. Boots are new to me. Okay. Whoa! Yeah. I thought you saidit was gonna be warm! It's just a figure of speech. When was the last timeyou walked through a stream? The last time? Mm-hmm. I think your idea of warmand my idea of warm are very different things. See? It's freezing! I know. I know. The water's fine. Oh. I used to come hereall the time for picnics. It's one of my favorite spots. I can see why. What? I think this country thingis growing on you. What makes you say that? You didn't talk business oncethe whole ride. That's about to change. Me and my big mouth. Did you take a lookat my offer? I did. And? Still mulling it over. Any idea when the mullingmight be over? We had a big stormlast winter. Did some damage to the barn. The repairs weren't cheap, and I... fell a little behindon the payments. I'll make it up, but the bankis running out of patience. That's tough. Yeah. You wantsome free advice? Sure. Toss a coin. A coin? Mm-hmm. Heads, you take my deal. Tails, you don't. But here's the thing. You toss the coin, you catch it in mid-air, keep it in the palm of your hand and don't look at it. Why's that? Because you should gowith what you hoped it was while it was in the air. That's the only wayto use a coin toss to makean important decision. Well, what if I want itto land on tails? Then I go home. Never darkenyour doorstep again. That a promise? You won't even visit? You want me to visit? Well, you are a... pretty great dishwasher, and thosedon't just grow on trees. So, how'd you come upwith this coin toss theory? Harvard. Economics class. Of course.-Hey! At least I got somethingout of my Ivy League education. I know somethingyou don't know, Mr. Ivy Leaguer. What's that? It's your turnto cook supper tonight. You're joking, right? This part of thatpulling-your-weight thing? I don't knowif you want me cooking. Don't worry. You'll havean excellent sous chef. Oh... there it goes. Good job. All right. And thenyou pour it back in there. Okie-doke. What do you think? How'd I do? Good.-Yeah? How's it going in here? Almost ready. The sous chef'sputting me through my paces. I'm a shoe chef? Sure is a lot of spaghetti. Yeah. I think we maybe madea little too much. I think it's timefor a taste test. Well? Is it ready? Yep. I guess we dida good job, huh, JR? Good job? I think we rocked it. You think we rocked it? All right, put it there. Okay! So, what do I do next? You serve it. All right. JR's gonnashow me a card trick. Hey. It's bedtime, kitten. Okay. Okay, I've got the cards. Can you show me the trick now? Yeah. Pick a card. Place it anywhere in the deck. Don't show it to me. Put it back in the deck, anywhere you want. Ready. All right. Is this your card? Yes! That's amazing! Sam! Isn't JR cool? He's a pilotand really good at card tricks. That's great, Annie. You know, Annie. I've been thinking aboutthat company of yours. Yeah? I was thinking that since you like horsesand you like helping people... Maybe you could use themas therapy animals. Bring 'em to kidsin children's hospitals or old folksin nursing homes. Cheer 'em up when they'regoing through hard times. Everybody loveshorses, right? I like that idea. I know! We could call it "Healing Horses." There you have it. Annie-bananie, it is time for your bed. Aw, Mom. Five more minutes? No, ma'am, your five minuteswas up five minutes ago. That's my last trick anyways. All right. Goodnight. Goodnight. Sam, tuck me in? Sure. Outranked again! An automated milking machine. I'm gonna go help Samfeed the horses. Oh, okay. All right, honey. JR. JR. Hey, did you and Sam havea good trail ride today? I did. Even took a little walkthrough a stream. My feet are just nowthawing out. She took you to the grove? Hmm! Why "hmm"? Well, I just... I don't think she's takenanybody there since Luke. A-And who's Luke? Hmm? Uh, Sam's fiancé. Well, her ex-fiancé. Yeah. They were gonna be marriedtwo years ago and then he got a jobin Los Angeles, and Sam couldn't do that, so it ended. It's the ranch. Sam takes her obligationto this land so seriously. Anyway. Do you want some tea? May I join you? Sure. This is... incredible. Yeah. You know, I've never done this before. Look up at the stars? Not like this. Whenever I'm feelinglost or overwhelmed, I just go outsideand look up. Sort of puts thingsin perspective, I guess. Do you see Ursa Major? Uh, where? There. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I do. You see the bear? A bear? Uh, yes? You don't see it. So tell me moreabout this Cowboy Code. Cowboy Codepillar number two. Take pride in your work. My dad instilled that in mewhen I was a very little girl. Sam, I know you love this ranch. Who wouldn't? But it must also feela little constricting at times. What do you mean? You were born into this, you didn't choose it. And I'm offering you a chanceto start your life over. Re-invent yourself. On your own terms. And at the same time, I can't help but think that there are so many peopleout there, like me, who would love to experiencewhat you have here. At a resort? We take pride in our work, too. But why does the landhave to be uprooted and paved for that to happen? What if the peopleyou're talking about could experience all this without the cementand bright lights? Goodnight, Richard. Goodnight. It's "Richard," huh? Richard, what's the latest? The board's all over me, trying to figure outwhat's going on out there. The airport's still closed, and Sam... Uh, Walker is still not readyto accept our offer. Which part? The selling-us-the-ranch part. Well, that's not good. Maybe you shouldtry a deal sweetener. The deal's sweet enough. I just need you to keep the board at baya little longer. What? Longer? Richard, I... Hey, I gottacall you back, okay? I'll fill you in later. Richard, wait. I... Hello? All right, this is pretty cool. Isn't it amazing? Oh, I love this game. Well, if you're lucky, I'll let you win me a bear. Well, ain't that sweet of you. Mom?-Yes? I want to go on the slide. Well, sure, sweet pea. Will you be all righton your own? Go, have fun. All right. Let's go. Enjoy. You want to give it a go? You want to show mehow it's done? I'll teach you. Thank you. I've been coming hereevery year since I was a kid. Hey... Part of what makesBighorn so special. You know, our development wouldreally put Bighorn on the map. Bighorn is already on the map. You just needa magnifying glass to see it. Your turn. Thank you. Oh, ho! JR, you have quite the arm! Used to play ball in school. You just won. Aww. For me?-Mm-hmm. Thank you. Should I give him a name? Well, I hear you can't trust anybody that doesn't havea nickname. That's Larryfrom the feed store. His family's adorable. Oh, can we get cotton candy? Sure! Hi.-Hi. Thank you. Cheers.-Cheers. Samantha! Hi, Maryann. Hi, Hal. Sam. We have something for you. For me? We had a secret town hallmeeting last night, and it was unanimous. Everybody contributed. Contributed? I'm sure it's not near enoughcovering what you need, but we just wantedto let you know that we love Walker Ranch, and we love you, too. Thank you very much, but I can't accept. You're like family to us. We want you to have it. And I appreciate that, I really do, but I... I can't accept this. I-I hope you'll thankeveryone for me. I'll figure something out. I'll be fine. I should gofind the others. Airport's opening up. Guess you'll be heading back. Yup. Gotta be heading home. "Home." Always beenone of my favorite words. Most people think it refersto a particular place, but I thinkit's more than that. It's a feeling. And sometimes you getthat feeling in the most unexpected places. So Annie wants to goto the kids' party with her friends, and we're gonna go over there. You want to stay? All right. Okay. What do you think? Looks like fun. After you, cowboy. All right. Yay! Beginner's luck! Pick your prize. I pick... that one. I used to love Ferris wheelswhen I was a kid. Coney Island. Used to go over and overuntil they closed. You know, I noticed you stopped doingyour neck thing. I do a "neck thing"? What thing? This thing... I do that? You used to. Huh. Well, maybe it's becausel feel more relaxed now. Mm. And what does "more relaxed" feel like? Pretty good, actually! Especially with the sugar rush. Do you have any ideahow long it's been since I've had this much sugar? I'm like a little kid again. I think maybe it's timefor me to teach you about Cowboy Codepillar number three. All right. I'm ready. Hit me with it. "Talk less, say more." Oh. That aimed at me? Am I talking too much? Maybe just a little. Consider me cut off. Hmm. And you just squeeze downto push out the milk, like this. Okay. All right. Why don't you give it a try? Uh... all right. I got this. Eh... I think she's broken. Just a little more pressure. Don't worry. You're not gonna hurt her. You're sure? Okay. Hey! I got it! That's really warm, too. Well, we got warm milk. All we need is cookies. Hey, you don't happen to haveany chocolate cows, do you? I really like chocolate milk. Chocolate cows. JR's funny, huh, Sam? He sure thinks he is. Hey! What, are youleaving me here?

I'm doing the best I can. Well, board meetsin the morning. I have to give them an answer. Understood. Well, I just want to make surethat you're relaxing. I am, actually. You've heard of a dude ranch? It's kind of amazing. Trish, this is no time to relax. This is about closing a deal. Actually, I have to go. I will be in touchwith you later. Go close that deal, son. I know you can do it! I appreciate your confidence. Bye, Mom. Bye, Dad.-Bye-bye. What's a "dude ranch"? Wrench, please? JR? Oh. Uh... Other one. Thanks. You know, we do haveone thing in common. Hmm? We both went intothe family business. That's true. Although, they arevery different businesses. That's true. Can I ask you something? Yeah, sure. Are you enjoying this? You know, trail ridesand ranch work? Ah. Pure drudgery. You kidding me? This is the most funthat I have had in... I don't even know how long. It's not easy. But, uh... there's something about being outside and putting inan honest day's work that's not behind a desk. I do have one questionfor you. What's that? When do we get to dothe real cowboy stuff? Real cowboy stuff? Yeah! You know, like, roping and riding, like in the movies. This is real cowboy stuff. Thanks. Richard, I talked to your father. Things are gettingvery tense around here. Well, then it's a good thingl'm here. Well, the board is afraid that if you can't close soon, then Global's gonnacall off the merger. Look, Todd. I think I'm close here. I just needa little more time. Okay. I'll do my best, but, please... Move quickly. Don't worry. Oh, by the way, I, uh... I mucked a corral today. You should try it sometime. It's very... relaxing. Seriously? Hey, I got to go. I will check inwith you later. Richard... Get the president of the boardon the phone right away. Okay. Okay. I want to hear your most embarrassing moment. All right. If you go first. Fine. Uh... In high school, I was crownedthe "Alfalfa Queen." I have literally no ideawhat that means. All right, let me paint you a picture. Hideous green taffeta gown, hideous lavender tiara, in front of the whole school. Wow, the many facesof Sam Walker. Mm. Your turn. There are just so many. How do I choose just one? Come on. No copping out. Well, there was one time, I forgot to bring my wallet to a very importantclient lunch, and I had to makethe client pay. That's it? Well, yeah, that's really embarrassing. Wow. That is embarrassing. By the way, I don't think that gate looks right. You sure? Mm-hmm.-Looks fine to me. I think, uh, you had a broken gate, and a city-slicker fixed it. Deal with it.- At least it's open. It's kinda fixed.-Oh... Do you need a hand? No, I can just hold it. Like, see? You're on your own. It's fine. So, Richard, when was the last timeyou made s'mores? Well... I think I was 10. Firstandlast time. Aww! Well, it's a summer tradition. Yep. Every Friday night. Here, JR. I made this onespecially for you. Wow, thank you, Annie. Okay, you need your Graham cracker sandwichand a chunk of chocolate. Okay. Graham crackers... and... chocolate. And here we go. Right. Whoa. Go ahead. Take a bite.-Okay. Mm! Perfection. I think it'sa certain young lady's bedtime. Oh... Yep. Come on, Annie. It's time for bed. Say goodnight to Sam and JR. 'Night, Sam.'Night, JR. Goodnight.-Goodnight, Annie. Goodnight, guys.-Goodnight, you two. Goodnight. This was really fun. I agree. You... You have a little... You've gota little chocolate... Um... I'm gonnaturn in, too, JR. Yeah. Goodnight, JR. Goodnight, Sam. You okay? Yeah, just a little sore. Kinda different than the gym. That's for sure. Hey, think we could gofor another ride? You really are likingthis cowboy thing, aren't you? Maybe. ♪ Motherdon't you worry anymore ♪ ♪ Soon, I'll be knockingon your door ♪ ♪ I am coming back home ♪ ♪ 'Cause I've been outin the fields ♪ ♪ In the hills ♪ ♪ All the yearsl've been gone from you ♪ I want to burn that viewinto my memory. It's pretty late. I should probably get you back. Get me back? Well, I just meanl would usually just camp here, but I don't thinkyou're up for it. Up for what? Sleeping on the ground? I didn't mean itlike that. I am so upfor sleeping on the ground. All right, then.-Okay. Then it's settled.-Yeah. So... what do I do now? Uh, you could getsome kindling for the fire. Okay. I'll take your horse. Thank you. So I don't realizeshe's the wrong blind date until about halfway through, she looks at me, she says, "Why do youkeep calling me Cynthia? My name is Robin." See? You're just fullof embarrassing moments. I actually needto thank you for something. For what? You showed me that my ideato save the ranch is possible. How so? Watching youthese past couple of days... baling hay, mucking the stalls... riding horseback. You seem different. I feel different. Freer, more relaxed. Right. And if the ranch can do thatfor a city-slicker like you in just a couple of days, maybe it can do itfor other people. Businessmen and women. Ordinary peoplestuck in nine-to-five jobs who could usea dose of this life. Give 'em a chance to sleep outunder these stars and recharge their batteries. You're talking abouta dude ranch? All right, I peeked at your notes. The Cowboy Code would beparamount to my dude ranch. Live each day with courage, take pride in your work, talk less, say more, and... "Always finish what you start." I'm sorry, I-I couldn't wait, I had to ask Buck. Oh! So, what's stopping you? Well, there's stillthe little problem of my mortgageand past-due payments. Ah, almost forgot. Yeah, and there's also the fact that I don't know the first thing about creatinga proper business plan. I do. And you want to help me? Yeah. Why? Seems likethe right thing to do. Never knewthere were so many stars until I came out here. Kind of makes you wonder. Oh, yeah? About what? Everything. I could really see myselfout here. Really? What happenedto the city-slicker? Well, he's still here, camping out in the wildernesswith Sam Walker. May I ask you a question? Sure. Are you happy with your life? How do I know? I think you knowwhen you know. I'm happy now. In this moment. That sounded likea mountain lion. That's becauseit was a mountain lion. I think we shouldprobably turn in. Mountain lionsdon't eat people, do they?

Something like that. This is... This is nice. Better in person. Well, hello there. Uh, sorry. We're just a little weatheredfrom that long cab ride. Wow. Look at this place, huh? I can't wait to get... to get started. We are so excitedabout implementing our plan, but I'm sure Richard has beenover all the details with you. He's very thorough. Where are my manners? It is great to meet you, Mr. Walker. Can I call you Sam? You can call her Sam. Oh...-Oh... I'm Sam Walker. I own the ranch. Oh!-Oh! Okay. Uh, well, I'm Todd Batesfrom Belmont Corporation, and this is my associate, Ashley Carter. Hi there. We're lookingfor our boss, Richard. Tall guy. Todd? Ashley? Richard?-Richard? What are you doing here? I didn't authorize this trip. Oh... Uh... uh, I'm sorry, Richard. I... We have some newsthat's best delivered in person. Mm. Global is threateningto pull out of the merger unless you closethis deal right immediately. And? And the board has voted to purchasethe mortgage of this property from the local bank, which meanswe now own the note, and, unfortunately, we're goingto have to foreclose. We have to do it right awayor the project's dead. They can't do that. I'm the CEO. Well, of course, they can. It's in the bylaws. But, the good news is your dad lovesthe dude ranch concept. Loves! Loves it. We already have plansin the works to implement. What? Wasn't enough for youto steal my ranch, you stole my idea as well? Sam, this is a mistake, I can fix this. You know, you're really goodat what you do, Richard Belmont. I was starting to believeyou actually cared. Sam, just listen... Come on. Richard? Come on!-Let's go! Why don't we let the lawyershandle the rest of this deal? So we shouldtake the ranch by force? It's just business, it's not personal. It'salwayspersonal. There's nothing more personalthan home. Richard... our plan is a good one, and you'll never find a placeas perfect as this location. Our plan? It's not our plan, it's Sam's plan, and this is not right. Richard.-Um, if you could just... Richard?-I'm so sorry. For everything. Ah, we'll be all right. So will Sam. Guess I was wrong to think that Sam and I could... Just comefrom different worlds. Maybe... but you'd be surprisedhow much you can have in common with someone who, at first glance, is totally different from you. You're a good man, Richard. Don't let anybodytell you any different. Includingyou. Ah! Come here, buddy. Don't forget to look up at the stars every now and then. Okay? Annie around? Oh, she is, but it mightbe best if you just go. She's not great with goodbyes. Richard? We really should get going. Wait! JR, don't go! I gotta go, Annie. I gotta go home. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. Are you coming back? I don't think so. I understand. You have to go home. Home is the best placein the world. Do you love your homeas much as the ranch? No. No, I don't. Richard? We've really gotto get back to New York. So sorry. Bye. Great. Good. Cool. Thank you. Uh, so, Richard, we have so much... Yeah.-...To catch up on. Exciting plans.-Yeah, Rich? Richard? You're just gonnaput the horse away, then? I'm surethat's what he's doing. Richard? Uh... Todd, Ashley. I'm afraidl can't go back just yet. You can't go... back? You're kidding. This placewill never be a resort. It's a home. Hyah! Where's JR going? If I'm not mistaken, he's going after a girl. Oh, no. We are so fired. Sam. Stop right there. Go away, Richard. I don't want to see you. Sam, I just need five minutes. I don't want to hear it. You couldn't get meto sell the ranch, so you stole it instead. You stole everything! Sam, I had no idea that my company was gonna buyyour mortgage, and I never suggestedthat they use your idea. Then where did thatcome from, hmm? That's a conversationl have to have with my father. You'd better get that. I wouldn't wantyour precious deal to slip through the cracks. Sam... I know I came to Bighornto close a deal, but being here with you... changed me. I got to know Buckand I got to know Catherine and Annie, and this place... look at this place! You can see everything. You can feel everything. And for the first time, I saw me, and I felt me. I felt what it was liketo be alive. I'm not in Bighornto close a deal. I'm here to find outwho I really am... who I'm meant to be. Oh, yeah? And who's that? The guy who fell in lovewith this place, with this life, and with... I know you're not supposedto mix business and pleasure, but it's too late for that now. There's no going back. I really don't know what to say to that. You heard your colleagues. It's over. Not necessarily. You still have 72 hoursto make back the payments. Might as well be 700 hours. I don't have the money. What if you did? Let me makethe mortgage payments current. No. Thank you, but I don'tneed you to rescue me. I'm not rescuing you. I'm buying into your idea. The dude ranch. You want to investin my idea? Yeah. Why? Because I lived it, Sam. "Cowboy Code." I lived it, and I loved it, and I know that other peoplewill love it just as much as I did, and they'll pay for it, too. And mostlybecause I don't want to go. Let me get this straight. You want to bemy business partner? I do. What about your job? They'll probably fire me. That's okay. My heart's not really in it. I'm not sure it has been, for a long time. Are you sure about all this? Live with courage, right? The code. Then I guess we have a deal. Just like the ladiesto keep us waiting. I suppose so. Hello, Daddy. JR. Annie.
