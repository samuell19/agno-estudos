I don't know, boring, mostly. Young offenders? Young offender? That's like play school or something compared to prison. So where you staying? Ah, don't worry boy.

I said... I'm looking for Mary. Mary. Where the fuck were you? Come here. It's good to see you, Donny. You, too. So how've you been? All right, okay. Kenny's dying to see you. Saw him at the pub. He's been unbearable, like a kid the night before Christmas. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you. Yeah. I tell you what, I'll come by later tonight, when you finish, walk you home. About 10. Yeah, it's really good to see you, Mary. So that's the famous Donald McKinley. You finished those glasses yet? Unexpected, so we could actually see a really glorious end to the working week, make the most of it the weekend, though, not working to get us all. With all of these frontal systems queuing up. Finding out how much you pay for them, could be reaching an all time high. Cloths selling out fast, now towels hone in on ticket for the ashes. Unique little thing, and the little brother's word, whereas these guys. Hello, good evening, welcome to the program. Our top story tonight, victims groups have criticized a court ruling to allow an arson killer to be released after serving less than eight years of a life sentence. Donald McKinley was convicted of killing a local school teacher when he set fire to the family home in Leicester eight years ago. He was just 17 years old at the time. The ruling follows new European guidelines on the probation of first time offenders it considers to be both completely rehabilitated, the first convicted killer to be released using the rule, seven years and six months, former Kenny was a model prisoner, showed true remorse. The victim of the fire, Rebecca Soter, was a respected and popular teacher. A spokesman for the family, Rebecca Soter, was a wonderful daughter and we are deeply disappointed to hear of the release of Donald McKinley after such a short period of time. Sorry, I'm trying to give up. I'm sorry about earlier. No, that was my fault. Just showing up after... 10 years. 10 years, yeah. Just turning up. Well, you look good. You too. Really good. You haven't changed. Fuck off. So you like working there, now? Like it, no. It's shit. I thought you'd be off traveling the world. It's all you used to talk about. Bored the shit out of me and Kenny. Yeah, well, things don't always work out how you hope they will. Fuck's sake. What? You're like my oldest friend. Christ, it was the same with Kenny. Really awkward. Give it time. We all need to get used to you being back, especially you. You know I've been reading a lot actually about prison life and books about it and stuff. Really? Yeah, well, you wouldn't let anyone visit, would you, so I decided to read about it. There's this one bit. It's about this guy Jolice and how he felt after years being inside. He said something about this about how he just used to avoid people, 'cause that was the only way he could keep out of trouble. He wouldn't really talk to people and just be the same things over and over again, and then when he got out, it was like he had forgotten how to have a proper conversation. Yeah. There's more than that. There's the touching thing. The what? It's the first thing you learn. You don't touch anyone. Even bumping into someone can get you killed. Really? No, no, not killed, but you know what, just to have a barrier around everyone, even friends, you talk to them, you don't touch them. Jesus. I've hardly touched another human being in 10 years. I better get back to the fucking B N B. Place locks its doors at 11. Yeah, okay. Four days ago. The fire, Rebecca Soter. Disappointed to hear of the release of Donald McKinley after such a short. Cut off, can you go? You're gonna have to go. Anyway, back to Barney, while walking Rose Street, him with his pint in hand, with his, whatever that was. Milk. Milk? The fuck you drinking milk for? I was on the appeals court for that thing. - What thing? - That thing in his deck. Wasn't it? What's wrong with the fucking? Hey, will you shut the fuck up, eh? You're ruining the fucking story, eh? Anyway, right, so, him with his pint, right? Him with fucking milk and I've got a bottle neck, remember Donny? And we come to that garage where they wash all the buses, off Brinsley Street. One in Bonbarn. Aye, one in Bonbarn. Those fucking buses, like they're lining the road. He goes, "Buses, eh? "Fucking love buses." And he's fucking gone, jumps on a bus, right in a driver's seat, fucking starts it up. Bus is fucking shaking, he's revving it, a fucking racing car. I look over, there's a driver, over the yard, like, "Oi, that's my fucking bus." "That's my fucking bus." Like we don't know who's fucking bus it is. Me and Dan jump on, right, start pushing buttons, pulling knobs, and must have pressed something 'cause the doors shut and start moving just as the driver hits the door, and he's like fucking, bang, bang. He's pulling that door hard. He fucking hits the pedal, swings that massive steering wheel and we're off and the driver, he goes fucking flying. Breaks his foot on the curb, eh. And he pulls over the Prince Street like he owns this fucking thing, right, and then he sees this bus stop loaded with like late night shoppers, old farts, their kids, he pulls up, opens the door to let them on, and they're all looking at him like, "Huh? "Why is this fucking kid driving a bus, eh?" They don't care enough to ask. They start handing over their change, and he's going like, "Thank you, thank you." Pushing that ticket thing that spits out tickets. Me and Don, right, we are fucking cracking up in the front seat right. - With a hand? - No a fucking. Next thing, out of nowhere, force us off the road, did, and the fucking passengers, they're all like... Fucking screaming, falling over, short legs going flying, and he finally pulls up with the same fucking garage that he picked it up at, and that driver, he's still on the fucking ground, screaming. Me and Don give it legs, me one way, Don the next, fucking couple of pigs chasing me, eh, but didn't I make it up Chapel Hill. - And Donny? - Oh fucking hell. He gets a top by a bunch of the old pensioners. Smacking him with a tartan handbags and that, and before he can get off, popos grab him. What happened then? Well, there's nothing they could do. I was a kid. It's actually on his record, eh. Fucking HBH on a driver, theft of a bus, shutting up old folk wherever they could think of, eh? The more, yeah, 'cause you didn't fess up on me and Dem being with him, eh, not a fucking word, so he gets full force forever. And then your mom sent you way after. A month after. Wanted you away from bad influences. He's back now, either way. True, Donny. Are you staying or are you just passing through or what? Huh? Is he staying? Passing through, what do you mean passing through? Just asking if he's staying or else is he passing through? What are you talking about, you fucking idiot? Donny's fucking home, eh? This is where he belongs. Eh? To Donny. Fucking welcome home, son. Things are gonna be great. I can feel it. You and me together again, eh? Looks like I'm carrying you home. Fuck it. Listen, I gotta tell you some of these, eh? First, we're getting you some decent clothes. You look like you just got out of prison. Two, I'll go out and show you around. People you should know. Three, Donny look at me. Look at you sitting there. Drinks, hey. More fucking drinks, right, drinks. Sorry to break up this lovely moment boys. You not had enough yet, Eddie? Donny. Oh, sorry, you're right. He just winds me up, though, if I have to hear one more story about what you two used to get up to. I don't remember things the way he does. That bus, no one got on it. We just drove around. Who would go on it? Donny, I know this is difficult for you, and I don't wanna push it, but seriously, I am getting really, really tired of this. You know, you've been back for three days now, and no kiss? Maybe Kenny was right. You did turn gay in there. Hello there, sorry to keep you. Can I help you, love? Any vacancies? - Always. - Something quiet. It's 30 a night, includes breakfast if you want it, served in your room if you want it. Where are you from? Sorry, supposed to make friendly. That's what they tell me. Oh. Can't even smoke one bloody house anymore. Bloody do gooders. Who tells you? Supposed to make friendly? Oh, tourist board people. They come round with the leaflets, you know, and their free advice. Think they know better. 22 years, I've been running this place. What advice can they give me? No one wants to visit this dump anymore. It's not my fault Everton's fallen into rack and ruin. The town, not the house or me. Bugger that. Old habits. 'Cause, no visits, no jobs for them. You staying long? No. And your wife? Well, number four, top of the stairs on the left. There's no one else in, so if you don't like it, you can always switch, but that's the best room. Used to be my son's. It's next to mine. Son's? If you need anything, you know who to shout. It's Miss Tomlin, by the way, happily divorced, or Sally. I keep it friendly. That's what they tell me to do. Tourist board? See, you got it. Top of the stairs. Thanks. Where's your man, right? Trying to get at you know who. All right, just fucking keep going at it, then. Shut it, down. Oh, you just, keep going tomorrow. - Shall I? - Yeah, I could take it out. See a fucking rose? Go fucking bet your sister, shut the fuck up, right? Shut up. You're finished? Are you finished? Fucking show up, can I finish my fucking story, now, eh? Jesus fucking Christ. It's not like that. He's just reaching, all right. Greatness in prison, GTV, pool tables, Christmas dinner. There's that. Taking away someone's freedom, that's punishment enough, believe me. So how do you get through it? Just take it day to day, control what you do with your time. I read a lot and I played chess. Yeah? Okay. And this newspaper, fucking swats stone if they heard a fly. Swat, those fucking lie. Andy Joe's like, "What the fuck?" Up point, Donny jumps up, "Is that fucking right, is it?" Bang, bang, bang. Beats the pants out of Andy Joe with his own fucking iron bar, eh? Town looks smaller than I remember. Different. No, it's not changed. That's the problem. Maybe it's me that's changed. Your brother thinks so. Donny, I think you should keep away from him. Why? 'Cause he'll drag you down with him. Everything he does now is about his gangster pals in the city, trying to impress him. They use him to move drugs, run errands, they're laughing at him, but he doesn't see it. It's pathetic. He's just a nobody trying to mix with the big boys. He'll have hell if he finds out. They're not his friends, Donny. They think he's a joke. Look, he's got someone works over in one of the big hotels, sends tourists over looking for the real Scotland, he takes them for their cash in the pub, scams them at pool, locks them outside, whatever. He'll hurt someone sooner or later. Something, something's going to happen, and if you're close to him, you'll get hurt, too. Scares me. Donny just sits down, finishes his fucking pint like nothing's happened there. All of the members are around a bar table, there's blood all over it. That was Donny? That was Donny. That's why I enjoy him, don't I? Fucking humiliate. You know, he jumped off a bridge, tried to kill himself, so his battle tastes. Fuck him, should have picked a higher bridge, though, eh? Who the fuck are you, sunshine? Jonathan Soter. I don't really wanna know who you are, dickhead, but nice to meet you. Fuck it, sit down. I'll buy you a drink. I'm looking for someone. Oh, eh, who's that? Think you might know him, Donald McKinley. Never heard of him. Anyone else here heard of him? I think you know him. I don't give a ruddy shit what you think, pal. You there? Did you hear what I said? Right. Now get the fuck out of my bar, before I break your fucking head. Who the hell was that? Fucking space cadet. - Fucking Stepford something. - Jesus. You're on the wrong side of the bed, okay. Can I sleep now? - No. - Get off. I'll get off. Oh, no, come on. Stop it. Stop it, it might be important, stop it. - That's it. - Hello? Sis, it's me, is Donny with you? No, Kenny, why would he be? Why would he be? That's odd, I'll wait. What do you want Kenny? What do you want Kenny? Well, when you see him, if you do, someone's been down here asking after him. For Donny? Aye, dunno but he's tall and oldish. Looks edgy, Tommy. Tommy? Sutener. Oh, well, who was it? I don't know. I don't know who he fucking is, Mary. Just tell him. I'll tell him if I see him. Yeah, yeah, if you see him. What? Kenny said there was someone looking for you down at the pub, some old guy, English. The fuck do you want? Where's Donny? Get the fuck out of my bar, eh? You have somewhere to be? Fuck do you want? Fuck off, you old cunt. Where's fucking Donny? Fuck him or what, hey? Where the fuck is Donny? - Fuck, is it broken? - Oh, my God. - Where's Donny? - What happened? I don't know, fucking friend of yours, that's what happened. Old friend? I don't know fucking know who he was, right? He's here looking for you. He's handy with a pool cue. He said his name Soter. Aye, John Soter. You're saying John Soter was here? Aye, he's fucking dead, Donny. I'll take his life for this. He could hit that. It's my fucking nose. I'm only trying to help you. Fuck are you lot, anyway. Standing around with your fucking dicks in your hand. - Lost, were we? - Shut the fuck up. You shut up. It's open. It's fucking open. There's one in here, he's coming in. Maid's day off? - Jesus. - Aye. I was at fucking hospital all night. Mary with you? Aye. Just like socially. First thing we've done together for ages. What are you watching? So what happened last night? Yeah, he'd been around to me. Trashed it. Fucking hit. Get us my pills and a beer. They're in the fridge. Nice combo. So this is the bloke who's house you torched, is it? Yeah. We'll have to sort it. I know. And I will, Ken. Me. I'll sort it. This is my thing. People are laughing at me. I can't have that. I've a reputation. That's how it works. How what works? This, what I do. And what is it you do? Some old twat walks into my bar and gives me a kicking? Oh, I'm gonna pick a fight. All right, take your pill. Can you just do me a favor? Let me handle him. Why? Why? Fucking why? Because I'm asking you. All right. Do it quick. Make sure people know it happened. Tell 'em I asked you to do it. You still not fucking to say? Course. They fucking love me out there. You know what I want? His name's Derick. Don't call him that though, fucking hates it. Call him Deck. That's his deals. He'll sort you. Give him my sooners, where we? I just got from the last couple of morons you sent up here, 'course then. I heard about it. Aye? You heard? Yeah, I heard. What the fuck is wrong with you? What? It's a good deal. I'll see you later. Likewise, Donny. Two of us, back doing what we do, eh? It's a good thing. See you in the pub tonight. Tell Mary I'll see her down there. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello. I came up here earlier, but you were asleep. Take that away for you. Yeah, come in. Did you have a good night last night? Sorry? You got back late? Nothing worse for wear? Are you a journalist or something? That's mine. Sorry if I disturbed you last night. No, I'm a light sleeper anyway. Like I said, nothing much to do except look after my guests. You being the only one. I've seen it a lot over the years. Seen what? Loneliness. Traveling is a lonely business. Look, I'm married, so. You're never lonely then, that means. Sorry I bothered you. Hang on. Something, oh God. I didn't mean... In fact, I think you're the nicest person I've spoken to in ages. She's a lucky girl. You're right, though. It is lonely. Living without her. So tell me about her. It might make us both feel better. Rebecca. We met at school. Teachers. You don't look like a teacher. I don't feel like one anymore. I was never much good at it, but she was, Rebecca. She was a good teacher. She loved teaching. I really loved that about her. That's one of the things I remember most. What happened? Fire. At the house. I can't even remember why we were drinking, but we were. We used to drink together, that's what we did. It wasn't always like that, but towards the end, the last couple of years, Christ, we drank. It's what we were about. When the fire brigade found her, they said she was still in bed, and no one could understand why she hadn't tried to get out, but it was because she was drunk. Some kid had started the fire. Turned out he'd been at our school briefly. I couldn't remember him, but the police thought maybe she knew him and that something had happened, good teachers make enemies sometimes. I still drink. I don't know why. I did stop for a bit, but it was like something was missing of her, of us. Christ, I don't know why I'm telling you all this. I don't know whether it makes sense. Donny. Derick. It's Deck, call me that again, I'll kill you. First thing, Kenny gave you something. So you got the shit kicked in by some old boy, eh? Fucking schoolteacher ain't he? We all had a good laugh at that one. What you after? What you got? How much you spending? 80 quid, 31 P. 80 quid, what's that? This ain't January sale time, mate. Fucking Kenny, I don't know why I waste my time. Can you do me something or no? 80 quid. You can keep your 31. Here's a little treat for you 80. You know anything about guns? That's a 32 auto. Three inch nose, nine inch safety. Easy conceal, easy to handle under stress. You'll need to get up close and personal with that. It's no 38. You can handle that. My eight year old sister can handle that. You'll get one 32 clip for that money, push it up the grip, snap it in. It's got no safety on it, so watch you don't shoot your cock off. Release it here. Carry it around empty. Load it up when you need it. That's it, have fun. That was quick. Do you want a drink? No thanks. Give him a pint. So'd you get it? He don't give a fuck. Let's have a look. Nice. What's it cost? 85. All right, it's a good price. What is that, a 32? I don't know. Hey, Jim, fuck off for a bit. Found where he's at. Shitty BNB down in Fullhouse. - Fullhouse? - Aye. Off Fire Street by the chapel. Listen, though, don't do it there. The landlady's a nosy cow. Sally Tomlin, remember her son, Skinny Mack? Guess what, Kenny? I'm not stupid. I told you I'll handle this and I will. Just do it right, Donny, right? This is fucking embarrassing for me. Can I borrow your phone? All right. Just be careful with it though, aye. It's my new one. You can shoot and edit videos in it. Does it make phone calls? Aye. Well, then, really who gives a shit? What's wrong? Donny? I need your car. This is about that man, isn't it? The husband. No. No it's about me. I tried to kill myself in there. Donny, let me help you. I want to help you. My mom, she hated me. What I did, she couldn't forgive me for it. She blamed herself. I killed her. No. I need your car. Why? What are you gonna do? End it. - Donny... - Don't you see it. - What? - I don't deserve this. This, I don't deserve us. You're wrong. I killed someone, and no matter what, that's what I am, that's who I am. That is not what you are. Just give me your keys. No. Give me them. Whatever you're thinking of doing, Donny, please don't... Give me your keys. The table. This is Donald McKinley. Are you there? If you want to end it, meet me at the Beacon Memorial in an hour. It's just outside town. It's quiet up there. Do you know it? I'll find it. My mum used to bring us here for picnics. And up there, broke my arm. The picture in your room. She died when I was in prison. We never spoke again, after what happened. She was Catholic, couldn't forgive me. I have one picture of my wife, one picture. All the others burned, all of them, everything. That one grainy picture is all I have left to remember her by. What about her family? Her family blamed me for what happened, and they're right, it's true. I wasn't there when she needed me. I was out drinking when you burned my house down. I was laughing in the pub with my friends while you were killing my wife. Look at me. In prison, I thought a lot about how useless the word sorry is. How pathetic it is. Even think it may be an insult to say it. You're right, it would. Could tell you why it happened. Why I did it. It doesn't matter. My mom used to say... I don't care, McKinley. I don't care about you or your mother or why you did it or whether you're sorry or whether you're not sorry. I don't fucking care. I've got something. I took it from the house before the fire. Take it, take it, end it. Take it, anything, please. It's not what I want. Not anymore. Where the fuck's Donny? How the hell should I know? He called you. He said anything, what did he say? What's wrong with you? Why can't you just leave people alone. You've taken the first half of his life, what you want the second half as well? What are you on about? What is wrong with you? Oh, fuck off, Mary. Yelling at me. He's come back to restart his life, Kenny, since you ruined it in the first place for him, and now, he's back to right where he started, and again, why? Because of you. I'm telling you, Mary, you shut the fuck up. Go on, get the fuck out. First, I haven't done anything. And second... Listen to me, Kenny. Keep away. Keep away from Donny and keep away from me. Look at me, look at this. People are fucking laughing at me. Fuck off Kenny. Just get the fuck away. This is not about you. It's about him. Get the fuck off me, Mary. You're right about one thing, though. People are laughing at you. Always were, everybody's laughing at you. Shut up. Oh, yeah, Kenny thinks he's a big hard man, throwing his weight about. Look around you! There's nobody here. Only you and your pathetic mates, getting drunk down at the pub every night till you can't fucking stand. So what, what about you? What about me? You're still here, aren't you? Yeah, but they're not laughing at me, Kenny. They're laughing at you. No one is fucking laughing at no one. Oh, you think you're some big name down in the city, don't you? You're nothing. You're a joke. Is that why they give you all the shit? Running dope to the middle of nowhere? Rolling tourists for beer money? You're a pathetic little joke. You're pathetic, Kenny, pathetic, 'cause this is all you'll ever be. Yeah? Mary? I can't understand you. He what? He's here. We'll be over as soon as we can. What did you do? You know what, Donny boy, it's none of your business. What is your business is what happened with you and that bastard? Leave it, Kenny. You said you'd kill him. No, that's not what I said. That's what you fucking said, right? I've told people I was getting it sorted. My reputation, this is my work. Look, you know what, we're not 10 years old. What the fuck does that mean? It means grow up. You fucking... You are just like Mary. This is no joke. This is what I do, right? What is it you do? Someone steps up to me, I have to stand up to them, that's how it works. If I have to kill someone, I do it. Fucking hell, Kenny. Don't you fucking laugh at me, Donny, I mean it. You've never killed anyone in your life. You wouldn't know where to start. At least I do it face to face. Not like some coward burning down a fucking house. Don't. Give me the gun. I said, give me the fucking gun now. You've lost it, Kenny. Give me the gun. Give me the fucking gun. Kenny! Kenny! See, I told you you've changed. You were right, I have. Don't do it. So you're off then? I am, thanks for everything. You don't have to thank me, sweetheart. I didn't do anything, not for lack of trying. You ever make your way back here, you know where to come. Yeah. I'm supposed to say that. - Tourist board? - That's it. Well, thanks again. Safe journey. Where is he? What's happening? I shouldn't have come back here. You were right to send me away. Donny, listen to me, let's go. Let's leave here right now. I'm sorry, stay here. Donny, please. Stay here. Donny. What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? I know you're Kenny Tennant, local thug. Keep your mouth shut, right? You should really keep this up to date, eh? Where's the fucking Englishman? Who? Look, you just tell me which room because honestly... He left, paid and left. Your mother is ashamed of you, Kenny Tennant. God, I love this. I want to move out here, live here. Right on the beach. Well, we can, why not? Perhaps we should get married. I mean, if we're moving out here. If you want to. Go on, then. John. John, John. John Soter. John Soter. Soter. Soter. Kenny. Kenny. Don't you fuck with this, Donny. This is over. You keep out of this, all right? Come on, Kenny, you're better than this. We were friends, Donny. Mary used to say we were like brothers. She was wrong. Sorry. Let's go. Subtitles by explosiveskull
