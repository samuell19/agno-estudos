My mother is from the Tao Tribe. They say I'm not a citizen of this province. But I know I'm from the Tao Tribe of Lanyu. Lan yu. It is famous everywhere for the white Butterfly Orchid. It is a place where there are 4945 people of the Tao tribe who have grown up here generation after generation. Pongso no tao We say of this pongso no tao. It means There are people living on this island. So it's called the Island of People (PONGSO NO TAO) for short. Ose. Hello. Dulu, Long time no see I would like to introduce my master A-Fei. How are you, how are you. Which motor is yours. The front one. Oh, you did brush it off a little bit. Sure. Will you take my master with you? No problem. We will take this one. Mom I'm back. Hello Auntie. Hello. Meibana, you didn't call us all the time. We were so worried about you. For not calling us. We decided to return at the last moment just for the sound work. Mom, this is my master A-fei. Hi there, mom. Meibana, it is too crowded in your house I'll take A-Fei with me I'll meet you later. Ok, bye. Students. This is your homework for this week.

Can I go to the restroom, Madam. Ok, go I want to go too. Ok, hurry, there and back. Who else wants to go to the restroom hurry up. Mom no message from my father? You too, wandering around in Taiwan. And not coming back home making us worry about you. Whose paintings are here mom? How come they are spread all over the house. She is a school teacher who lives in the dorm I was worried that she would be afraid of being alone. So I told her to move in with me. Oh Ok. She can sleep here it's ok for me to sleep outside on the balcony. Well ok, it is all right to sleep on the balcony, quite cool. Watch out. Yes. I'm in Lanyu. Not so soon I'll stay for a while. Do you like to talk to her yourself. Ok. Just be like that. Mom my dad says that he'll stay in Mainland China for a while. If he's not coming back. Some needs him over there. Just say he isn't coming back. He didn't care about us anyway. Mom, I'm going to the balcony. A dozen or so years ago I finally found out that dad has a wife in China. I have brothers and sisters there. And Yina suddenly became the second wife. Is this fate playing with us? Or a tragedy of the times? Anyhow, our family has had no peace since that time. Where is Mom? Is everything all right? Of course. Hi there uncle, where are you going? Up to the mountain. There is something he needs to do. Your mom had a very difficult time after your dad went back to Mainland China. It is ok, it's Hui-Shins' painting teacher, Anan. She moved in a couple of days ago your mom is much happier now. That is her teacher? Yes, have you seen her? No, but she put all her paintings in my house. What did she paint? I don't know. Black. Seabird. Seabird? Is it? That is a seagull. The sea bird is called a seagull. Come and watch this. I'm using it I want to use it. You guys had better hurry up. You may go to play after finishing drawing. I finished it already. How is Shichie Anrou? I don't know, we haven't seen each other for a long time. We have out own things to do. Shichie Anrou says she's not coming back for the. Flying Fish Festival this year. She can't do that. Girlfriend? She's Ose's sister. A-Fei, what kind of sound are you looking for this time? I tried to find something pure and non-polluted sound in here. Very difficult. I don't think it is difficult sounds exist in nature. Look A-Guei. There are lots of fish. Did you see that? Uncle. He is my uncle. Go go go. Uncle. Uncle. What? What are you doing here? Are you going fishing. Fishing? No. Uncle, what are you doing with those stones? If the fish see that hairy fellow they'll be scared off! We're recording. Uncle. Let me introduce my master A-Fei. How are you doing? Uncle. Uncle. Uncle, where are you going? When will it grow, Uncle. Tomorrow, it will grow as large as this. When my brother-in-law comes back. It will have grown very very big. Uncle, mom asks you to go back to eat dinner. I need more stones. Hello, do you want a ride? No thanks. The place we are going is over there anyway. We can take you. Thanks. Ok, that's be it bye. She used to come back every year Why not this year? Ose, Ose. Hello Uncle. Hello Grandpa. What's wrong? Somebody step on your tail? Look at your sour face! Shichie Anrou is not coming back this year. And I told her she doesn't need to come back any more. Don't get mad at her. Very irritating Not listen to the advise. She did say to me. She feels that no matter how good her Hair Dancing is. It is not necessary for her to learn dance in Taiwan. Don't you think it is a pity. She's not learning out Lanyu Hair Dancing. What's wrong with your sister. Why won't she listen to her brother and father and grandpa? Well, I don't want to bother Shichie Anrou. That's too bad. She's not willing to learn to dance properly. Xi, Jianrao. The world think we are born to be a couple. I also thought she would be my bride in this life. She is a natural hair-dancer. So she went to learn dancing in Taiwan. Just one more piece, just one more. Come back. What are you doing here, uncle? Why are you here? The sheep are not coming back. They ran away, they are not coming back they grew up. Uncle, my mom is waiting for you at home come with me. Hey, get off me! I have a lot of pretty stones at home. I'll show you. Mom. Uncle's back Where is the stones? Where are the stones? Where did you put the stones? Where is the stone? There are no stones. Let me help you. Prepare for dinner. What is uncle singing? I don't know. Mom, what is uncle singing? It's a song of inauguration. But I don't know what he is singing. My mom says she doesn't know either. Let's go, let's listen to him. Uncle, you have a very beautiful voice. Give me the stuff that falls off. I'll exchange with you, ok? Eat this. No? Forget it. Uncle. Where are you going? Where are you going at dinner time. Uncle. Uncle. We met but didn't know each other. Isn't that strange? I think so too. I think out lives must move at a different pace. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Mom. Aren't you at school? We have an exam today so there's no class in the afternoon. Let me help. Ok, be careful. Can you do this? You can teach me. You can take my knife. Be careful. Don't stain your clothes. Be careful. Hey. What is the noise? Go on up. Go on up everybody. Don't talk so loudly. Up. What is the matter? I'm their teacher. You guys talk so loud that I can't record it. What does that have to do with us? What do you mean what does it have to do with you? You have driven out all the sounds. This is not your own private space. Why can't we come here? Are you their teacher? You should know how to behave. Do you know how to respect people? Forget it. Children, louder go on louder. Take off your clothes, go swim. Stay away from the deep places. What's wrong? She looks quite cute I didn't think she was that fierce... Who tole you to get in her face anyway? I get in her face? It's OK Let's go. Master. The sound we recorded today is not bad. Sounds natural? It is natural, but... The sound becomes a bit odd when the kids came. Did it cause interference? Yes I feel that all these sounds are natural. It depends on how you listen how you feel. The sound of children is pretty nice too. You understand? On the hillside. There comes a shepherd. He had 50 goats. The goats run. Run to the seaside. Two fools. Are looking for which way the wind blows... What are you doing here. Why don't you sleep it's midnight. Go to sleep now. What are you thinking teacher Anan. Look! Beautiful! On the hillside. There comes a shepherd. He had 50 goats. The goats run. Run to the seaside. Two fools. Are looking for which way the wind blows... Hey. Ok, Ok. Mom. On the hillside. There comes a shepherd. He had 50 goats. The goats run. Run to the seaside. Two fools. Are looking for which way the wind blows... It is you. How come it is you? Why did you record my voice without telling me? I didn't record your voice I'm recording the sound of insects this, and in the morning you were drawing me secretly too. I was here to record the sound of bugs and crickets. And recorded your voice by accident I didn't meant it. But don't you think this is very rude? I told you I'm here for bugs and crickets I didn't come to record your voice. It's midnight, why aren't you asleep? Go to sleep now. Be quiet. We woke my mom. You not only drew us and even took a picture. Well, I'm really sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about. I'm sorry I didn't know. It's ok. You did this too? Yes. Bye-bye. I'm not coming back for the Flying Fish Festival. Please tell my brother... Shichie Anrou. Come all the flying fish. May out Flying Fish Festival be a harvest. Please come close to the seashore. After cutting it open inside. You do two cuts inside and three more cuts outside. Can we do more cuts? No. That is allowed in other villages. But not here. We can't eat it if you do more cuts. Anan, watch out do not stain your clothes. Ok. Teacher Anan. You're getting more and more like the local people. Why don't you just stay here and don't go back to Taiwan. Let's dry the fish Ok. You guys wait here for me I'm going to prepare dinner. In a moment, everyone will eat in here. Mom, I'll go to help you Ok. Come for dinner you two. We'll be right here. Come on, eat. Come on, dinner is ready Meibana you sit in the middle. Ouch, I hit my head Careful, careful. You'd hit your head even if you were here everyday. Mom, this is for you. Thanks I'll go back to Taiwan in a couple of days. You have business in Taipei? What will I do if you go back to Taipei? You stay and settle down a bit more. Well, the master goes back to work. And the pupil stays. What's wrong with that? Eat your flying fish. It's not hard to go back or to have a good time if you stay. You're right. How about Shichie Anrou? Are you Ok about leaving Shichie Anrou in Taipei by herself? Oh, that's not what I meant. It's your responsibility to stay. What are you dreaming about? Nothing, what did you say just now? I want you to stay I know. Meibana I've been living in your room for a few days I'm so sorry. You don't have to be I like to sleep on the balcony anyway. I think I'd better move back to the dorm at school. Sleeping on the balcony is quite comfortable. Think about it. Well have you gotten used to this place? At first I had a very difficult time I wanted to go back to Taipei all the time. But now I have gradually gotten used to it. Would you want to go back now? Yes, after all, I am not a Lanyu person I have to go back some day. How about you. Me? I came back to collect audio samples. Maybe I'll stay here a while. Don't you miss your girlfriend in Taipei. You mean Shichie Anrou? We have been... considered a couple since we were very young. When I was younger I always thought that I would marry her some day. It's just that later on. I didn't feel the same. Did you fave a fight. Nope. Has she fallen in love with someone else? No. There's nothing happened between us. It is just different, that's all. Meibana. I would like to give you this painting as a souvenir. You keep it yourself. Just take it. Ok, I will put it here. So you will not take it with you later. Anan, you sure you're moving out? Well, only Huishin and I will stay here. Mom, I will visit you once in a while. Let's go watch out. Mom, off me go. Bye. I'll leave it here. Thank you. We are here, teacher. Mom. It is not ready let's eat outside. Meibana, let's go eat. Wow, you have prepared lots of food. My mom says. The environment here is much better than in our place. No wonder you like it here. That is not true. There is only me here during holidays it is terrifying. Or do you want to move back with me? Mom, I just moved out and you want me to move back What a nuisance! You said yourself it is terrifying to live here. Mom, she's complaining you are not good enough to her. That's why you want to move back. Of course not I told you, you are better than my mom. Don't talk like that. Ok, mom, let's eat. Otherwise ants will come. Come on eat. Anan, do you have a boyfriend. Mom, you had better ask him. What do you mean? My mom says it will be difficult for me to find a bride. If I am always wandering around I told her don't talk about this now. It will put us off our food. Haha. Ho Da. Uncle Can we do the record now Can we do it now. My relatives and friends from different villages. I'm nervous I forgot. Uncle, where are you going. To water something. A mouse. A mouse. Running straight ahead. Running straight ahead. One has no tail. One has no ear. A-Na. What's wrong with you. In a bad mood? No. Don't try to put one over on me. Why are you teaching here? As an escape, I guess. Escape? Yes, I'm here as an escape? Not like you you are here to pursue something. What are you escaping from? But my mood changed after I came here I become firm and steady here. So, Pongso no tao has made you beautiful. And it's gotten you painting. Maybe I found myself. Or maybe... I'm falling in love. Really? Tao? Yes I'm falling in love with pongso no tao. This beautiful island I used to be very complicated. But now I am quite simple. Coming from the far-away island Is flour, is rice. Our taro field are sunk our millet fields overgrown. The boats set sail and carry away our children. Leaving a lonely waste behind them. I am a useless old man. Unable to pass on our traditions. Let the camera catch my soul. The passage of time sends light and shade over the sea. When will the good ole days come back? Pongso-no-tao. Wow, you have made so many things. What is this? That bag? Do you want other colors? Everything's packed? Yes, yes. Don't come running back tomorrow. That would be all right as well. Of course. I hoped you could stay too. Right. Mom. This flying fish is for you. Thank you. Thanks uncle. Come visit us sometime. Sure. Let's go. Hey, this is for you. What is this? When did you record this? Make sure what you really want. This is important I know. Let's go. I'll take you there. Uncle. What are you doing here, uncle. Making goats. My goats say, you will find them and bring them back. That's lovely! This is for you. This is its mother. These are the kids. You made them really pretty! (Seediq) I give them to you, take care of them. You are talking about different things. Do you understand? Do you understand? It is difficult to understand you. Lunatic! Don't talk if you don't understand. You take this with you. I'm going to find my goats. Bye. Take good care of them don't let them run away. Enough, he doesn't understand you anyway. Anan. What are you doing drawing. Can I take a look. OK What is this? These are the grandma's feet over there. I found people in Lanyu do not like to wear shoes. That is why everybody has a pair of strong feet. These are the feet of grandpa Shiaban Madino. Oh yes? His feet is quite strong and wide. Just like his behavior. Let me show you something. Do you know whose feet are these. I have no idea. These are your mom's feet don't you recognize? I have never watched my mom's feet that close. Oh, where were you? No where I found a place let me show you. OK Let's go. We're leaving. Ok, riding carefully. Have you noticed that there are marks on every tree. It really is. These marks are left from the earlier generations. Other people can not cut those trees that is for them to build a house and a ship later. And to get a wife. Is there any mark of yours. Here? I don't think so. So how can you get a wife later on. It's Ok. I will go cut one or two. Well have you ever think about. What will happen. If I put my sound into your work. I don't get it I'm still thinking, that's OK ah. What a big spider. Oh come on that is a coco crab. It is not poisonous just don't touch it I'll be your guardian. Hit with a tree branch to prevent a bite from the snakes. Anan, my mom ask me to bring this to you. That much. Be sure to finish all of it I don't want to bring it back. Say thanks to your mom. She is really nice to me. You know. After you left. It really felt like missing something. What do you mean. I mean you moved all the paintings so as the sound. Don't get it. Isn't there lots of bugs sound around my house. They stopped since you moved out I just can't record. I dropped my white color did you take it? One bar of white color? I didn't take your white color! In that case why I took your sound. What is the connection with color and sound. I didn't take your white color. Look at them they are so happy. I was kike that when I was a kid. Dipped in the sea everyday. Diving or fishing when there's nothing to do. Do you want to go diving. Have you ever get into the sea in Lanyu. Not yet. This is it wanna go? OK Let's go. I take this. In fact. It is not a bad feeling of getting wet in the rain I have never been like this. Really so we can stand here getting more wet. No, we will catch a cold. Just for a while. Come on I'll go myself. Do you know what is to share pleasure and pain. Come on, let's get wet. See, it is comfortable. Here comes the bus. Hurry up, let's go. Come in. What happened? Leaking? Yes, it will leak inside when it rains outside. You'd better move back with us. Where do you live then. Me? I said it is cozy to sleep on the balcony. Thank you. No problem. It is OK. I think this is about the same. Didn't you say you're not coming this time how come you still come back. Well, I had a fight with my brother and he won I see. You had a serious suntan. Lanyu. Papa, brother, I'm back. Where is everybody uncle. Where are they uncle. Not here. Ose. You drink first. Strange, where's Ose and others go. Who knows? I don't care he didn't want to see me anyway. Hi, dad, I'm back. You're back my kid. Didn't you say you're not coming back? Why you come back? Where is my brother? He know you're coming back. So he went fishing he should be home soon. You're back. Went fishing? Have dinner in here. Sure. What are you doing here. Didn't you say you're not coming back? You insisted to ask me back I told you in Taiwan that I don't even want to do I don't want to dance anymore I just want to do something for myself can't I. Dad and grandpa worried about you all the time. That's why I'm back what do you expect. Don't fight with your sister. What's the point to fight with each other. Just leave if you're so easy to get angry I'll leave as you wish. Stop saying that where are you going. Don't get mad. Teacher goodbye. Where is uncle why didn't he come back. Forget it, he'd better stay in China. And never come back. Wait a minute. I'm back mom. Come here to sit. It's Ok. I'm going out right away. CheiAnRou I'll call you later. This is Hui-shin's teacher, Anan. Nice to meet you teacher Anan. Nice to see you. She grew up with Meibana. She's Ose's sister CheiAnRou. Want to come up. Mom, Ose's... Ose gave me some fish. You two are both here. I have something at school I'll leave first. Bye CheiAnRou. Bye. Have a seat. What are you doing? Sh... Where is CheiAnRou. She went home. But the sound comes back. What do you mean? That means CheiAnRou goes and you come. You brought back the sound. Sound is not important. People is more important. You should get a grip on her. Child, it is getting dark are you going to shoot the fish at this time. I will handle my own business. How come you couldn't understand the elders. Your uncles would be worried about you. I know. Hey, uncle I went fishing. My children will come back tomorrow I'm afraid that they don't have fresh seafood to eat. It's getting dark don't get into the water. It is dangerous at night. So dangerous. I know. Hui-shin. Go ask uncle for help. Isn't Meibana back? It's totally dark let's go find him. Uncle, have you seen Meibana. What are you worrying about? He just went to shoot fish. There's nothing to worry about. You go home first I'll go take a look I'll go there for Meibana. It's OK. Ana, he will be fine. You can go there and take a look if you want I'll go check there. Meibana. Meibana. Meibana. Meibana. Meibana. Meibana. Why are you here? What's wrong? Why are you here? What's to cry about? I just went fishing! What's wrong? You're all wet! Ok, don't cry you look ugly when you cry. Where's mom? Let's go. Where's mom? Chei Anrou. I'm worried about you I just came to take a look. So long as nothing's wrong with you. I told you not to go fishing at night. Why do you still go? You've frightened the old people half to death I just told you. He just went fishing. Not so many fish, right? Look, why do you come home at such a late hour! Let's go home. What brings you here? I just don't feel right. Wanted to see you. I'm fine. I can tell that Shichei Anrou is a good girl. And. You are... you grew up together. I just want some quiet time alone now. Are you going to leave like this? Don't you want to tell your brother? Chei Anrou. Chei Anrou. You can tell me if you have something on your mind. At least we are. What are we? Friends? Yes. I just feel. I don't belong here anymore. Meibana. You'd better get a grip on yourself. Just like me. You know? Chei Anrou. You're going back to Taiwan so soon. Don't go. Come back with me. What are you doing here at this late hour? You frightened me. It was you who drew me here and you're complaining that I frightened you? Who drew you here? Isn't it you who brings the sound back and forth. You take the sound away when you move out. And bring it back when you move in. Well. What's this? You take a look. Be careful, it will jump out. Oh, I see I still think you're really something. Moving the sound back when you come back. Taking the sound away when you're away. Actually I'm thinking someday I will put my sound into your paintings. Put you into my sounds. Uncle, what are you doing here. Go find Meibana and both of you come with me to my secret base. But I have a lot of things to do today. The house, OK. Really? I'd like to give it to Meibana and his bride. So the house is for Meibana. You are a generous uncle. You... you are the bride I'm not his bride, uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. What are you drawing? This is for you. And this goat too. This is beautiful. You take this this is pretty good look at this. This is a good painting. The whole island is only 45.75 square kilometers. Its circumference just 38.45 kilometers. The mountain is 548 meters high. My uncle never wants his goats to leave his sight. Maybe he is afraid the goats will vanish like the orchids in Lanyu. My uncle has started to collect rocks again. His plan this time is to build a tribe. With 6 tribes in Lanyu already he wants to build a seventh one. He says he'll give it to the world as a present. People in the tribe think he is crazy. I don't know: Is he wise or brave? Some come back, and some leave. Some leave as the host. Come back again they have become guests. Come back again after a few years and poof! They're tourists from Taiwan. Anan and I insist on staying in Lanyu. My reason is this is my home. My relatives and people live here. Anan's reason is that she like this place. I think her real reason is she loves me too much. I think she is an angel in my life. Really, I hope one day I can put my sound in her painting to hug this angle tight during my mortal life. Meibana and Anan are still in Lanyu. They live in the house that Uncle gave them. If you see a girl sitting on a stone and drawing. She is probably Anan. If you meet a guy wearing earphones in search of a "pure" sound. He is probably Meibana. And the goat-keeper on the hill is Uncle. Thanks to all the friends who helped with this film
