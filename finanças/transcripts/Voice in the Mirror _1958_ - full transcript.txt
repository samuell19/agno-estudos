- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes A special trick. Usually you twist it three times and give it a good quack and... ...you're lucky if you get, oh, six, seven drops of hot water. There, you see? Icebox is kind of small, but... how much can two people eat? Got plenty of storage room this thing. Washtub's over here. Surrounded. Well, you're finished with the 25c tour. Remember, don't bother with that light switch 'cause it don't work. Lady that lived here before forgot some of her friends. A lot of kids around here. Well, low rents, a lot of kids go together. - Why, kids bother you? - My husband. Oh, they don't bother him, really. He loves children. It's... Well, it's just that he's been ill and... reminds him of... Not a bad bed. Well, it's not too bad. But where are they renting palaces for $22 a month furnished? It'll do. For a while anyhow. I'll pay you. My purse. I must have left it out here. Shouldn't you take a quick inventory? Don't be an idiot. We'll rent the place. Okay? Now, in this room everything works. Well, the radiator ain't so good, but... ...in this weather, believe me, you don't need it. I'll give you my paycheck. I guess the telephone company'll have $27,50, hm? Where do you work, Mr... Burton? My husband's a commercial artist, but I told you he's been sick. Oh, yeah, I forgot. You got, um... $5.50 change coming. I'll send it up by my son Gene. Oh, and I'll give you a piece of ice for that icebox. Well, I hope you'll be happy here. It works. In this room everything works. So we're to live in Asiatic splendor. Still lugging this around. Of course, if Mr. Hornsby gets back from New York, you're gonna show him those, and he's gonna say... "My, what a genius". Ellen, these are five, six, ten years old. How many times do I have to tell you I'm not gonna see Hornsby? It was crazy answering the add? When he asks me what have you been doing these last few years, Jim boy, what do I say? Birdwatching? - But his letter was so... - Don't keep harping on it! All right. But I ask you, have you ever seen a more beautiful frankfurter? Stop it! Kill it, will you? Beat it! Why don't you lie down on the couch, darling, till I'm finished? All you need is a little rest. A little rest. Hey, lady, you want me to put this in the icebox for you? Oh, would you, please? And thank your mother for me. - Okey doke. - Oh, and put the change for my paycheck... ...on the sink, would you, please? Oh, I already gave it to your husband. My husband? He let me in and I just gave it to him. Maybe he went shopping. Rise and shine! Rise and shine. Come on, wake up, everybody! Wash-up time. Let's go! Come on! Wake up. Where am I? Where am I? - What have I done? - Hold it, hold it, hold it. 176R - Well, what do you know? - What have I done? A sweetpea like you getting mixed up in manslaughter. Man... manslaughter? Oh, relax, just a common drunk like the rest of us. Come on, wake up, on your feet. Let's get up, come on. I was with people I'd known for a long time. We grew up in the same neighborhood. They even take my shoes. Outside, go get washed. - I'm back. - Good morning, Charlie. For nothing. I'm here for nothing. Yeah, they got a yen for you, kid. Come on, let's go! - I'm not mad. - You never are, Charlie. - Yeah, but I didn't do nothing. - Okay, wake up come on! - Let's go! - For nothing. Come on, let's go. On your feet, come on, wake up. Oh, thanks. Come on, wake up, on your feet. Let's get up, come on. - Busiest place in town, huh? - Yeah. Kinda surprised me, though, waking up in a drunk tank. It was the first time for me. First time? You kidding? I was born in one of these. Been on the wagon for twenty months. Twenty months. How did you do it, with mirrors? A bit closer than you think. I'll buy you some coffee when we get out of here if you want to hear about it. No, thanks. Coffee's not what I need. Thought I had a couple of dimes left. Show me on your receipt where it says anything about money. They get a kick out without even having to see the judge, now we're supposed to supply money for their first drink too. They do it every time. Harvey Pastor! Dan Gilbert. Hey. I... I'm sorry I gave you the brush-off back there. Forget it. - I get these morning shakes going... - Yeah, sure. If there's some foolproof way for staying sober, I sure better find out. I don't know about foolproof. Well, twenty months in the wagon, that takes some doing. Oh, a fellow in New York's got a hunch, that's all. Like what, for instance? Like admitting you're licked. And trying to get some spiritual help. - Spiritual? - Funny, huh? Oh, um... My name's Harry Graham. I play trumpet with a little band. We're at this joint, the Blue Grotto all week. Drop around some time, you might be interested. Wait a minute. Why some time? What's wrong with now? There's a bar across the street, and we could gam. You could tell me... Wait! No kidding, I really do want to hear about this. Since when can one drunk fool another? But thanks. Thanks... ...for what. Jim. What did you come down here for? To collect the remains. Beau Brummel. I'm dropping you off at Dr. Karnes' office on my way to work. Well, I thought there might be some change left over from last night. Come on, there's a bus stop. Who don't you go to work by yourself? I know where Karnes' office is. - He told me to bring you. - I don't care what he told you. I can get there on my own. Alright, alright, I'll go with you, but you gotta give me a couple of minutes to straighten myself out. Jim. Take it easy, how long do you think a dollar will last? - Can't you hold out for just an hour? - If you don't like it, why don't you take the bus and leave? Well, I just might do that. What'll it be? Since you don't sell gardenias... ...I'll have to settle for a bourbon. Yes, sir. Roll up your sleeve. I hope this hurts like the devil. It does. Hold that. Why does Ellen keep bringing you around here? What does she expect a few cc's of vitamins to do? - Ellen is a girl that lives by faith. - And you? I miss your bedside manners, Leon. Well, make a payment on the bill and I'll see what I can do. I didn't mean that. Boy, what you do to me. You know, I'm a really a very nice fellow. You should hear me on the phone at 3 o'clock in the morning... ...soothing some poor old hypochondriac. Gentle, kindly, understanding. But you? A case history of the two Jim Burtons. Hey, do you know, you've been coming to CMA for over six years now? Your first visit was with Ellen. The two of you were wondering if she might be pregnant. And the rabbit was quite sure. After that, the usual things. A little sinus trouble, head colds, in-grown toe nail... Then a few years ago the first Jim Burton went away. And the other on... Brother! Hospitals, sanitariums, rest homes. All down the drain. Chronic alcoholism. Prognosis? There's an old Spanish proverb. The only cure for the drunkard is death. Those Spaniards have a way with words. The proverb is true. Alright, why even bother trying to figure you out, huh? Have you still got that other chart? Isn't there a page or two somewhere on someone called Laura Burton? Just a few modest entries. Born, lived, and died, all in three years. With a fancy Latin phrase explaining why. Ellen lost a child too, but she didn't become a drunk. She didn't have to. I gave her a new child to look after. A little boy. Me. If it hadn't been Laura's death, you'd have found another excuse. One day you would have broken a shoelace and that would have been your excuse. - You were drinking before the child died. - I earned my own living. And I didn't steal from my wife's purse... ...and I could have stopped drinking any time I wanted to. Mrs. Halper's on the phone. Mervin's running a fever, almost half a degree. Hello, Mrs. Halper, how are you? I understand Mervin's running a little fever. Just a minute. Jim, why the limp? - Oh, it's nothing. - Wait a minute. You weren't limping when you came in. - Comes and goes, old age. - Stay here! Mrs. Halper, I'll call you right back. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. Alright. Let me take a quick look. - It's nothing. - Come on, climb up on that table. Come on, come on. You haven't had a real physical in a long time. I'm okay. - Here? - Yeah. - Here? - Hey, take it easy. It's just a Saturday night palsy, all the boys get it. Stand up. Come on. Put your feet together. Close your eyes. Morning after the night before. Mrs. Burton wonders how much longer it'll be. - She's afraid she'll be late for work. - Well, tell her to wait. Now look at that diploma on the wall. Dr. Karnes, licensed veterinarian. Very funny. Tell me about last night's binge. All I can remember is I woke up wanting to drink. Do you remember nothing about the drinking itself? Zero. What's wrong with that? Ellen, would you come in for a minute, please? All finished? Yes. Anything wrong? - Maybe. - What is it this time? Is my liver getting hard or my brain getting soft? Shut up! He's starting to show nerve damages. Something's gone haywire with his coordination. I want a neurologist to give him some special tests. I'm sending you over to the MP Clinic at General Hospital for a few days. You think I'm just trying to scare you? Not you, Leon, old boy. I'm telling you if you don't quit drinking, you can end up in an insane asylum! Ellen! You must get those tests. Honey, you all right? I'm not going. - Why talk about it? - I mean it. You are going, 11:15, second floor, Dr. Bernhardt. You better get a couple of good strong boys to drag me. Well, that can be arranged. What does that witchdoctor know? He shines a light in my eye and mumbles some mumbo-jumbo. Why are you doing this to me? Why do you suppose? Ellen. I swear to you I've taken my last drink. - Yeah, your last drink. - I mean it! You always mean it. Honey, I can't kid myself about this, I'm not an idiot. Remember when you were pregnant with Laura? Honey, remember those first few months? You'd wake up in the middle of the night... ...thinking you were the only woman in the whole world who had ever been pregnant? And I had to get out that little folder from the doctor which proved that statistically, ...it was safer having a baby than having your tonsils out? And I had to keep repeating that statistic like it was a magic word? Ellen. Now it's the middle of the night for me. You can't put me in that hospital. Honey, it's just for tests. Leon isn't even sure. I know he isn't sure. And that's the magic I'm hanging onto. - Oh, honey... - Look, I'll tell you what. Remember Hornsby, the advertising guy? He ought to be back from New York by now. I'll dust off the portfolio and I'll see him the first thing in the morning. - Leon thinks... - Just one more chance, hm? A month, a week? Please? Please. Will of iron. That's me. I feel like a new man already. Let's have some coffee to celebrate. Coffee? At three o'clock in the morning? What would you suggest, madam? Champagne? Of course it's only temporary, but it's a start. - Yes, sir. - I was impressed with your portfolio. Impressed. That's not a word I use lightly. Thank you, Mr. Hornsby. Oh, um, what was it specifically? - Huh? - This illness. Oh, like I said, it was a breakdown. A physical breakdown. - I'm in good shape now. - You'll have to be. We all row the boat around here. Maybe we're not one of those high-powered agencies you worked for in New York, but we've got up-to-the-minute ideas. - Yes, sir. - Here we are. Well, this is out team. Joe Perkins, Jim Burton. - Don Martin. - Good thing we've got another man. Liz is getting to be more than we can handle. Well, thank you, love. Hi. Now, this is one of our department store accounts They want to start featuring their Easter items. This is last week's add. Dull, no style. Paper, pencils, charcoal. You do a preliminary layout, two o'clock bull session we'll spitball it around. Spitball it around. Last week he told me I should mother-hen my idea till it hatched. I think I should have been insulted. Take off your coat, love. In this sweatbox, nobody wears an ounce more than the law requires. Hello? Okay, sir. Our master's voice. - Coming up? - In a minute. Well, don't forget to stand up for your rights. Make old Abe Lincoln proud. Hornsby's a very impatient man. Say. My first day, I've got the shakes pretty bad. - Well, this bottle of yours... - Aged in the wood. - Want a shot? - Yeah. Just a short one. Just so I can get by this meeting. Get a glass. First-day jitters. Of course everybody has them, hm? Oh, sure. A long one? Yeah. Better give me a good jolt. Isn't this a peach? Isn't it a loulou? For home bars. A neat little battery set. That expression on your face. It fools them every time. This is what I'm working on. Bet they sell a million of them. Coming? In a minute. Hi. Hi, you draw just like the funny papers. Oh, no, ma'am, this is very serious. You know what this is? This is a little old bull session. - Huh? - And I'd like you to meet the team. - What's your name? - Carol Mae Nicholson. Carol Mae Nicholson. Say hello to Liz, and Phil and O'Donnell. And I think maybe you'd better curtsey to Mr. Horsnby, an old spitballer from way back. Mr. Hornsby might be sensitive. But he's got such a big stomach. Not big enough. If I don't stop laughing, I'll have to go to the bathroom. - Could you draw me? - Sure, why not? But don't make me look funny. I can't draw little girls. Sorry. - What I'm trying to say is... - Okay, okay, go home and sleep it off, huh? Yes, sir, a little later right away. Right after one last one... a nice little... Okay, look, Mac, it's 2 a.m. They got a closing law, okay? - All I'm trying to explain to you is... - Fight it out with City Hall. Who's fighting... Who's fighting? Was I fighting? If anyone's fighting, it isn't I! I wasn't fighting. Dead soldier. Dead old soldier. Rest in peace, do you hear? Ellen! Are you alright, Mr. Burton? I guess so. I must have had a nightmare. - Oh. - Where's my wife? Oh, she left about an hour ago. I'm babysitting. How would you like a nice hot cup of strong black coffee? Maybe some scrambled eggs, and some toast... - Just coffee. - Oh, nothing doing just coffee. That doctor said, you see he eats a good breakfast. He's a nice man. When I told him about this... - When was he here? - Don't you remember? Where's Ellen? She could have stayed home from work. Well, um... she didn't go to work. Her and the doctor, they... they went... Where did they go? Answer me! Well, the doctor said for me to call him if you got upset. - Where did they go? - I think it's going to be alright. You... just... General Hospital, neuropsychological clinic. Hello? - Can I help you? - I want Dr. Karnes. - Is he on our staff? - No. Where does someone go to see about getting treatment for another person? That would be at the admitting room. It's at the head of the stairs. There's an elevator around the corner. Ellen, what are you doing here? - It's the only way, Jim. - Who's talking to you? Answer me, what are you doing here? We've got to commit you, son, just for a while. Over my dead body you commit me. Face the facts, Jim, you were raving mad last night. They found you crawling on your hands and knees screaming about a train... - ...that was gonna kill you. - It was a dream, I had a nightmare. You didn't dream it, you had an hallucination. They found you in an abandoned railroad tunnel, a tunnel that hasn't seen a train for five years. I don't care! - Give us a chance to try to help you. I won't let you commit me! I'm afraid it's not up to you, my boy. Your wife has signed the committal papers. She'll just sign another paper. Listen to me. Don't let them put me in here, please! I'll cut my throat before I take another drink, I swear it! Son, alcoholism is an incurable disease. If a doctor can help just one person during his entire career, he's a big success. At least let's see if we can slow down this nerve damage. He's not dangerous to anyone but himself. But I wanted to help him. We'll wait till next time. Maybe then he'll want us to help. It's better that way. Come on, Ellen, I'll take you home. Wine. Can't you shut that window? Say, um... do you got a phone around here? Yeah, the payphone's back there. I'm flat busted, and it's very important that I make this call. Well, the private phone's in the minister's office. He's gone home, everything's locked up. - You couldn't lend me a dime? - No, siree. - Where would this be? - Blue Grotto. - A bar? - Yeah. You shouldn't be going to no bar. I've got to talk to somebody, it's where he works. How long will it take me to get there? Hm, bars close at two. You'll have to wait till morning. Tell me something. This man I'm looking for, he said... Well, he... He said I should get some spiritual help. How do you go about arranging that? Haven't you ever prayed, brother? Yeah. Once. It didn't help. Would you like me to pray with you? - No, I guess not. - Brother. It's not hard to pray. The simplest one is just plain: Our Father, which art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." - Look, Mr. Owens, about the band. - Yeah, that were here. Called themselves The Melody Boys. Four nights, that's all. Well, I'm trying to locate the trumpet player, his name's Harry Graham. Don't remember him. Do you know where the band went? It's very important. The piano player said to forward all his calls to the Top Hat Club. Top Hat Club. Look, I need some carfare money. Do you have any work here just for a couple of hours? Yeah, I got a couple of dollars' worth of dirty dishes in the kitchen. - Fine. - Right through the back there. - Tell the cook. - Thanks. It's out of business, mister. Oh, evening, Mrs. Burton. My husband. Have you seen him come in? - He's not home yet, Ellen. - Hi. I was just passing by. I had a house call in the neighborhood. Leon, I'm just about to go out of my mind. Why, is there something new, or is this the first time our wandering boy has dis... Please. The doctor talks too much, huh? Give me a buzz when he shows up, will you? Twenty minutes for blood transfusion, boys and girls, and then we'll be back up here beating it out the way you like it... ...until gangrene sets in. So stick around, do you hear? - You were just great. - Thank you. Excuse me. - I'm looking for Harry Graham. - Which makes two of us. What happened to him? Same thing that happened to the five-cent glass of beer. Went bye-bye. Look, it's very important that I find him. Do you have any idea where he might be? One day he was here, next day he wasn't. End of sad story. - But... - Twenty minutes is all I got, old friend. And I ain't done no eating in an awful long time. Wait a minute, please. Is it true what he told me? He said he found a way to stay off the booze, is that true? As far as I know, Harry is the no-drinkingest cat in town. - Probably that's his big trouble. - Then you have no idea where he is? None at all? How many times I gotta tell you? Frank, give me my dollar or I'll be the no drinkingest cat in town. Didn't you make me swear to hold this buck till closing time... ...so you'd have a place to sleep, Mr. Tobin? Well, give me half of it, I can get a room for fifty cents. I wouldn't like to think of you in that kind of a room. Well, I can't stay here all night and not drink. Why not? I like your company, Mr. Tobin. Frank. What's that supposed to be? It's an educational toy for children between the ages of eight and ten. I bought it sort of as a gift for one of the kids in the rooming house. Because I left so quickly, I didn't have a chance to give it to him. Um... will you? Thank you. I paid 89c for it at the drugstore. I'll sell it to you for half a dollar. Who do I need it for, my twenty-six-year-old daughter? Believe me, that's too complicated for her. Please, Frank. Anybody want to buy a toy wholesale? You got a kid, mister? No sale, Mr. Tobin. Then you'd better give me my dollar, Frank. You'd end up in a drunk tank. - Bartender. - You want the toy? I want a drink, Bourbon. Bourbon, yes, sir. When you get to that drunk tank, if you run into a trumpet player, tell him I was looking for him. What would the no-drinkingest man in town be doing in a drunk tank? I guess it was the first time in a log while. According to him, he had stayed sober twenty months. Sober twenty months? Just thinking about it gives me the willies. Who knows? Maybe I'll have a grandson some day. Thank you, Frank. Not being sober for a month... ...that might interest me. Are your hands dry? I got it just last Wednesday. Mrs. William Tobin, requests the honor of your presence... ...at the wedding of her daughter, Sarah Rose, to Mr. John Franklin. Saturday, May 5th, 3:30 in the afternoon, First Congregational Church. Newbury, Iowa. - Did I get it alright? - All except what's written at the bottom. Please try and make it, Bill. Yeah. I'm trying to place that boy, John Franklin. I wonder if he was a student of mine. I haven't seen my family for fourteen years. Time has a way of slipping through your hands. That trumpet player, how did he manage it? I wasn't interested enough to find out much. Too much booze, a guy gets licked. Oh, that's easy. - Believe in God? - I do. What else? Well, the only other thing he said was... I asked him kiddingly if it was done with mirrors and he said I was close. Which ones are having a drink or two before taking a bus for home? And which ones are drunks? Like us. Us. - Hm? - It's a nice sounding word. When you're on the bottle, you have a feeling you're all alone. Tobin against the world. But I do have all those other drunks, don't I? Nursing it along pretty good, huh? - Want it? - Don't you? Yeah. So you'd better grab it in a hurry. Much obliged. Well, here's looking at you. Here's looking at you. Where have you been? Ellen, I wasn't going to let them lock me up in that place. I was only trying to help. You know that. You know that! Oh, this is Mr. Tobin. My wife, Ellen. Mr. Tobin and I have been talking for hours. I told him he could sleep in our house tonight. You what? If I'm going to be any trouble, I'll be on my way. Oh, no! - Honey, I've got something to tell you. - I could just shoot you. You let me worry myself sick for two days then come staggering in... - Staggering? - Well, what's that then? Oh, that belongs to Tobin. He bought it at the liquor store after we left the bar. There's a little left for him when he wakes up in the morning. Right now he can use some coffee. I'm afraid it's too late for coffee. End up your life with a bag of rags. Elementary arithmetic. William Mark Tobin, room 312. Forteen years and still carrying it around. They were going to make him a principal. But it got him so scared he started drinking a little just to calm down. I guess he never had more than a couple of beers in his whole life. Found out that booze did something special for him. From then on it was little old world, goodbye. What happened tonight, Jim? How do I say it without sounding crazy? There was this Harry Graham. I met him in a drunk tank. And he said something to me I couldn't get out of my mind. He said to stay sober, you had to get some spiritual help. - Spiritual? - That's what the man said. I spent the last couple of days looking for Harry and I wound up with Tobin. We talked for hours, I don't know how long. And I don't know how it happened, but... Well, we were both in the same boat. We talked the same language. It wasn't some doctor or minister talking about drinking, it... It was a couple of drunks. And while we were talking, I got the craziest feeling that if this poor coot could stay sober for a while, maybe I could. And if I could, well... maybe he could. It... it didn't work too well for him, and... tomorrow it might not work for me. But tonight, I feel like somebody lifted a hundred-pound rock off of my neck. I feel like old times. Makes no sense at all, hm? Have you heard one word of what I've been saying? - Yes, Jim. - What do you think? Well, I don't know what to think. Well... I haven't seen this little number for quite some time. Your mind's been on other things. - Still looks pretty good. - Well, don't look too closely. You know, you bought this for me the month before we were married. Yeah, I always meant to ask you about that. Didn't your mother ever tell you that it wasn't ladylike... ... to accept black underwear from a casual acquaintance? I thought we'd become less casual as time went on. - That was a crazy year. - Yeah. I loved it. How about the last date we had before we were married? You didn't love that. Cause I was mad at you that day. I didn't want to let you go. But I didn't want to marry you either. - Well, thanks a lot. - So I spent the whole night picking on you. Your stockings weren't straight, your hair looked mousy. I remember. And I also remember telling you exactly where to go. Yeah. Two hours after I left you, I was on the phone again apologizing. How long was I on that phone? Until I said, for Pete's sake, shut up and come on over. You still don't believe me, do you? I mean, about running the twenty-seven blocks. Don't be ridiculous. Then why was a gasping like a dying elephant when I got there? Well, I assumed it was passion. It was from running twenty-seven blocks. What's the matter? Nothing. - No good? - Sorry. Well, I guess it's been a long time... since I've been anything but something they put to bed... ...and turn over on the side to keep from snoring. Call Leon! I don't know, Leon, what happened to me was so different I can't explain it. I've always been the first to laugh, but, well... Revelations from on high and that sort of thing. I swear it was almost like... well... Like the voice of God. Well, go on, Moses, don't stop now. Oh, forget it. The spiritual experience. Joan of Arc had them quite regularly. But despite all this miraculous hocus pocus, you still should be undergoing treatment in that neuropsychological clinic. That's out. Look, right at this moment there must be a thousand scientists... ...losing a good night's sleep because they can't find an answer for alcoholism. Because they're haunted by millions of incurables going down the drain. And dragging millions of others with them. And this character tells me there's actually nothing to it. Just recite the Lord's prayer, admit you're licked and tell it to other drunks. Just a minute. Okay, you're sober now, and you look pretty good. But how do you know this isn't some sort of... Well, temporary self-hypnosis? That you won't wind up in the gutter the day after tomorrow... ...seeing choo-choo trains that aren't there. Leon, I don't think you should... Just a minute, Ellen, this is a sick man, Medicine is based on facts, not revelations. Okay, you stay sober six months yourself... and show me one other alcoholic this will work on, and I personally, Leon Karnes, MD, will nominate you for the Nobel Prize in medicine. I got a lot of things to do, I'd better get some sleep. - See you around, doctor. - You can bet on it. When we get our bill paid up, I might punch you in the nose. Thanks for the coffee, Ellen. Do you think that's all it is with Jim? - Hm? - Just self-hypnosis? Maybe. But it gives him something to hold on to, so don't discourage him. Me? What were you doing? I never discourage him. I only make him mad. How do you suppose it's gonna feel to have a husband around the house? What do you mean? Nothing. Small talk in the vestibule. So long. Yes, sir. He'll be right out. Thank you. Look who's here. I, um... stopped by to return the radio and to apologize. Did you indeed. It's not easy, sir. No, I don't suppose it is. Well, come along. I've had trouble with drinking for a long time. - Ever since my child died. - So your wife said. But I think now I've got hopes of beating it, living a normal life. - I honestly do. - You mean hold a job, be dependable? Yes, sir, I really think so. Look who's back. Well, what are you waiting for? Put it back where you got it. I wouldn't advise using my name when you're looking for a job. I seldom recommend drunks or thieves. Jim, wait. Darling little stinker, our Mr. Hornsby, huh? I had it coming. Oh, now, let's wallow in self-pity! Upward and onward with the Arts. A job is the first order of the day, right? - Yeah. - Well then you just follow old Liz... ...down to the drugstore. And while I make a phone call, you go to the counter order a couple of cups of coffee. Women are just born suckers for men in trouble. Didn't you know that, love? That's right, cast the four... like that... Well, what's this? Oh, hello, Jim. Just helping James here pass an examination in fractions. And boy, is he dumb. He is not, he's doing fine. Let's close out till after supper. 2/5 times 3/8, that sure is hard. I wasn't sure you'd still be around here. Oh. Mrs. Devlin gave me a room down in the basement... ...and my meals in return for a little tutoring. Cause I do have to do a little... charity work. Well, then we've both got jobs. I'm a painter of murals. - Murals? - Yes, on department store windows. Well, congratulations. I called Ellen at work, she sounded happy. We're having a celebration when she comes home. Just a quick dinner some place in the neighborhood before I start work. And you're invited. Oh. Come on then, we'd better tend to this now. - Huh? - I got something for you to do. Will it take long? Ellen will be home soon. Not too long. - What's the mystery? - You'll see. Paul, this is Mr. Burton. Some idea this was. Look, I didn't drag you here, and I'm not going to force you to stay. Okay. So this is the miracle man, huh? Paul. We've been falling out of the same bars now and... Well, at my age it makes no difference, but... it's a shame a kid like Paul who comes from a good family... I thought maybe... What you do is wave a magic wand and I never drink again, huh? No, it's not that easy. Well, how easy is it, Mr. Miracle Man? Well, I didn't bring along my soap box. I've been preached to by experts. But never by another drunk. Are you really a lush? I've spilled more whiskey than you ever drank. So how does this miracle of yours work? Well, if you want to hear about it, it's pretty simple. You might laugh. All right. Make me laugh. Ellen. Forgot all about Ellen. You should have sent me up, I could have told her where you were. Yeah, I should have. Jim. Jim. Wasn't there some wine left in that bottle last night? - So? - Well, I could use it. Look, I'm not your guinea pig. He is. Look, I'm sorry if I got you in bad with your wife. Oh, it's not your fault. Look, get yourself a hot meal. I can't take your money. It belongs to my dad. It's a souvenir of the Great War. They won't give me a red cent, so I was gonna hock it for drinking money. So this way you hock it with me instead. You really don't think he's going to spend that on booze? All I'm asking is if you start wanting to drink, look me up when I'm working instead. Maybe we'll get drunk together, huh? Maybe. I'll try. Hi. Hi. Sorry about our date tonight. Well, I'm sorry I walked out. I don't know, I guess I just felt kind of abused or rejected. I didn't have a washing to do so I went to the neighborhood movie. You did, huh? - Your lips are cold. - Yours are just right. - How about some hot coffee? - Coffee? Oh, um... what do you think? Immortal. - Jim. - Hm? I'm sorry about something else. What? Well, I mean, last night when you came to me. You wanted me. Why did I act like that? Maybe I'm just not your type. Oh, be serious. I was terribly worried. I was almost afraid of you. Now, isn't that stupid. Uh-huh. Are my lips still cold? Hm, that coffee works wonders. There he is. There's my old benefactor. Come to the old store if you start going nuts for a drink. That's what my old benefactor told me. He gave me his hard-earned money. Cause he believed in me. All right, okay, get out of here. - Me and my buddies, we came here... - I said beat it! God, he's such a benefactor. He gave me his hard-earned money. That's what he did. Honey, why don't you wait in the truck. I'll clean up around here and be with you in a minute. You know, I never thought I'd be looking for a drunk to stay sober with. Neither did I. But, Ellen, I gotta know that this thing I'm hanging on to... ...isn't just self-hypnosis as Karnes says. I've got to be sure it will last. The next time I'll find my own guinea pig. There's nothing like an old-fashioned hymn to make you fell good. And now, before we eat, we have a special speaker... ...with an inspiring message of interest to many of us. I came here today to talk to you about drinking, since drinking has been my favorite indoors sport for some years now. The trouble is that I recently found out... ...I had to quit or go batty. And I think maybe I've found a way to do it. Now, I know you fellows have heard a lot of talk about alcoholism. Never from a 14-karat-one-hundred-proof drunk. Look, um... why don't you fellows go ahead and eat? - I'm not sure... - Say, could you talk kinda fast... ...before they run out of chili. Sure, sit down. Don't stop now, preacher man, it's just getting interesting! No to me it ain't! I want to see my lawyer! This bum is interfering with my Bill of Rights. Pipe down! Shut up, you guys! Shut up! Talking to you like this is a crazy idea. I asked the guards if I could buttonhole something here when you came downstairs. They said it was okay to do it now. Guess we should have waited. If any of you want to get together with this, we'll be in the coffee shop across the street. Make it a bar across the street and we'll come... Let's get out of here. - The miracle man in person. - What do you want? Fellows in the tank really gave you a working over. Were you in that drunk tank, Paul? I woke up and there I was. First time. Oh, you got a lot of firsts coming. First blackout, first convulsion, first DTs. - First time your stomach starts to... - Why are you riding me? Well, why did you come in here? Hell, I don't know. He was in there passing out invitations. I guess I fell for it again. Last time, your routine didn't keep me sober two hours. - So why should it work now, huh? - Cause now you're scared. - I told you to lay off! - Relax, junior, we're all scared. Sit down. - Are you Mr. Burton? - Yes, I am. They didn't tell you the patient was a lady. No, they didn't. Oh... I understand. Guess we've got ourselves a coed. Say, officer. We know this fellow, we can take care of him if it's all right with you. - It's all right, but keep him off my beat. - Yes, sir. Come on, dad. Come on, help me. Hello. Yeah, this is Burton. - What? - What is it, Jim? All right, take it easy with him. Yeah, slow down. Sure I'll come over, sure. Now, what's the address? Here we go again. Yeah... yeah... Let go... let go of me... You can't... Help! Help me! No, no, no... hey! Jim, open the door, hurry, will you? - I thought you'd be out shopping till ten. - Oh, I ran out of money, so... Folks, you haven't met my wife. This is Ellen. Hi there... pleased to meet you. There wasn't enough of us to rent a hall so we came here. We're almost ready to break up. Just waiting for the guest of honor. Paul's been sober four weeks, so we're making it sort of an event. That is, whenever he decides to show up. He still doesn't answer. He'll be here. Maybe you could put on a pot of coffee? All right. Steve, you were just starting to tell us how you almost managed to stay sober an entire day. That was years ago, but, boy, it was sure a close call. It was election day. All the bars were closed up tight, so the wife thinks, okay, this is it. Of course the missus knew I always had whiskey bottles hidden all over the house... so she just had me spend the whole day... ...out in the back weeding our little truck garden. Well, 6 o'clock finally came around... and she unlocked the door, and told me to come in eat my dinner... ...figuring, boy, she had really outsmarted me. Well, I climbed to my feet, and fell right on my face drunker than a dozen gypsies. How did you manage that? Well, all the time I was on my hands and knees on all those weeds, I was sipping a 100-proof through a long straw. You see, I had me a quart of bourbon stashed away in a gopher hole. Can I be of help? You shouldn't have done that. I know. I'm so sorry. What do you suppose is running through their minds now? Oh, I couldn't help it, it... It was just so unexpected coming in here and finding... oh, Jim! Do you know I've broken my back night after night, week after week... talking to hundreds to gather together six... ...hoping to find one that I can hold up to Karnes and say, see you bullheaded fool, I've proved it works? Honey, I'm so sorry. They're so unsure of themselves, so afraid! One little spark and... Jim. Is it Karnes you want to prove something to? Or yourself? He left. Why don't we go down to my room, it's more private. I guess I should be getting on home. I'm late and my wife gets worried. - Naturally. - Well, it is getting a little late. Yeah, no telling when that Paul will be showing up. We can't let every little thing throw us. Getting together like this is important. - Which one of you is Burton? - I am. Well, let me tell you something, Mr. Burton. I ought to have them put you in jail and throw away the key. Harriet, come on home, this is ridiculous. I'm Paul's mother. You've given me and my husband a night we'll never forget. - What do you mean? - Paul tried to kill himself tonight. Tried to kill himself? Where is he? In the Emergency Hospital! All because he couldn't live up to his rules. - How is he? - The doctor says the boy will be okay. - No thanks to you. - Harriet, come back home. Who do you think you are? My son, he felt such shame because he failed you... ...that he took a razor. A razor! I was only trying to help. That's a mother's job. Who gave you the right to play God? Paul told me about you. You're no better than he is! You're all crazy if you listen to him! What does he know? Just the kind of drunk that they take out of every gutter in town. You do your drinking inside behind closed doors or I'll call the police? - Harriet, stop this! - Now you listen to me! I'd rather have my son any way at all. Drunk! Sick! Crippled! Any way but dead! Steve. Steve. - Jim. - Yeah? I, um... I think I'll go over to the hospital and see Paul. Yeah, look, when you see the kid, tell him I'm so sorry. Jim, if I don't get a chance to, would you tell your wife goodbye? Goodbye. Well, maybe not exactly goodbye, I, um... I'll send you a card and tell you how the wedding came off. You're going home? Well, I guess so, I... I bought the bus ticket. What I thought happened. But I wouldn't let myself believe it. Come on, now... Looks more like I invented the printing press, I, um... I don't know how long it'll last. Ellen. I heard. All these wonderful deadly calories. Now, you just sit there. This is your party. No, I'll help you with the dishes. Well, I mean... ...he looks better than the last time I saw him, but how could he look any worse? He hasn't had one drink in five weeks. A man who wasn't sober a single day in fourteen years, so... So? So, you once told me if a doctor cured one alcoholic in his lifetime, he was a big success. Cured is a pretty big word, Jim. Our Jim is somewhat given to exaggeration, Mr. Tobin. You go five years without getting drunk yourself, bring me fifteen or twenty more people this has worked on and I may be mildly impressed. Forget punching me in the nose, there's still a good bit more due on the bill. When you arrive, let me know how things are going, do you hear? I may be back in a couple of weeks tooted to the gills. I don't believe it. You and I are the hope of drunken humanity. Hope of drunken humanity. Hey, that's a big responsibility, son. You'd better get back to your truck, you're gonna get a ticket for it. I'll say to the judge I'm saying goodbye to a drunken friend. No kidding. You're gonna be late. Besides, saying goodbye always gives me the willies. Okay. So long. Don't let those cops take you, Pop! Liar! Liar! Hope of drunken humanity. That's what I am! That's what I am! Why didn't you let me alone? Mr. Burton, I can't have things like this happening in a building I'm responsible for. I've got worries of my own, I... What happened to Tobin? I don't know. He said something about his bus being late. He was alone, I guess he got scared. There was a bar nearby. He came in here like a crazy man, trying to destroy the place. And then someone called the police. Poor old guy. How much more, Jim? No more, it's all over. Everybody can relax. Okay, Ellen? You can relax too. You were happier when I was a drunk, weren't you? You really were. You had a function, a reason for living. You had to take off my shoes, pour hot coffee down my throat. Clean the rug when I made a mess. You didn't have to be a wife, you could be a mother. You could make... What's your pleasure, sir? - A bourbon. Make it a double. - Sure. - Do it again. - Sure. I almost forgot how it felt to have that pile of rocks staring at me. Just make sure you don't let the water boil over. I spent my money on a gift for a lady. Well, the price is still 80c, sir. I have some money at home. - Where's home? - Over around 34th street. Never make it there and back by closing. - Can I pay you tomorrow? - Why not? When you come back here, you'll find it waiting for you. - I'm good for the money. - You've got an honest face. But I've never seen it before. Miss. You've just moved in here, haven't you? Last week. I'm Jim Burton. We live in this floor. - Hi. - Hey, listen. I'm in some of a spot. I got my paycheck today but I got home so late I wasn't able to cash it. And my wife has one of her migraines and... ...I have to get a prescription for her at some drugstore. I don't know where I'll find one at this time of night, but... Well, they won't know me from Adam and... So I need a couple of dollars in cash just till tomorrow morning. - I'm sorry, but... - Listen. You'll stay around here, you'll find out anyhow. Lady, I'm the neighborhood drunk... ...and I need a bottle of whiskey so bad I could crawl up these walls. My wife is still up or I'd go in and steal from her purse. I'll pay you back, you'll get it first thing... Hello, Jim. He came by about half an hour after you left. Where's your purse, I need a few bucks. - Look, Jim... - Save the sermon. The liquor store closes in a little while and I'm pretty busy. That makes two of us. I was telling Ellen that if you didn't come back soon, they'd better reserve a place for me in that same old drunk tank. Oh, boy, this is sure my jinx town. I got back day before yesterday and look at me. - How did you find me? - A couple of drunks told me about you. They laugh themselves sick at me. And keep smashing up their lives. I asked you where's your purse. - Jim, listen. - To what? That nice little game of talk, talk, talk, that doesn't work? - It worked for some of them. - Oh, sure. A month for this one, a week for that one. - Big deal. - Isn't that better than nothing at all? - What about you? - Who, me? I'm a great success. A tower of strength. I didn't come here looking for a tower of strength, all I want is somebody to help me get past the night. Well, leave me alone! You're letting him go. So we'll meet on the floor of the drunk tank. Full of regrets and begging for just one more chance. Well, that was your last chance going through that door. Chance, chance for what, to drag by from day to day? Jim, you just can't quit. - You didn't talk like this before. - Well, then I was blind before. Jim, listen to me. Harry and I talked for hours. Not just about you. The wife of an alcoholic gets mixed up too. Seeing her husband turn into... ...nothing but a pulp, it does something to her. Oh, honey, if you'd just be patient with me. If you'd... Jim! Don't go. I'm not like Paul's mother. I don't want you any way but dead. You can be a man. I want you to just help. - Oh, honey. - No. Someone needed you tonight. His life depended on it. At last I felt such a fierce pride and then you sent him away. - I couldn't help him. - Not even to get by the night? - The night. - Well, that's all he wanted. - That's not enough. - Why not? If you'd helped him tonight, maybe he'd have been the one to help you tomorrow. Maybe that's all you ever have to do, just get by the night. Jim. Harry. Harry. Don't expect any change. It'll take every cent we have to bail Tobin out and bring him home. Okay? I told myself it would be ridiculous to live here. Nobody can be that sentimental. I've just given that fawcet a couple of good whacks... to see if it still gave six or seven drops of hot water. Do you know what time it is? Well, after all these years, they can start the meeting without me. Maybe so, but that phone's been ringing for about an hour. Come on. What's this? Glad to see you. This is my wife. How do you do? Paul! I just got a letter from you from New York, just yesterday. Well, now, when did you become a member? Hey, does the roof have to fall in on you before you catch on? It's a special meeting, darling, for you. Ten years can pass pretty quick, eh, Jim? Speech! Speech! Speech! Speech! You've given me a day I won't forget for a long time. It's been a pretty good ten years. Oh, a few rough spots here and there. As for the applause, well, it's a great sound, but, um... Look, a few of us were lucky enough to stumble onto an idea. But nobody owns an idea. And nobody has a right to stand up and take a bow. And in a way, I guess that's part of our strength. That all of us, all the hundreds of thousands of us all over the world, are just nameless alcoholics getting by just because... ...we realize we're all in the same boat. None of us more that one drink away from the gutter... ...for the rest of our lives. So what do you say we get down to business? This meeting will come to order. My name is Jim Burton. I'm an alcoholic. Who, knock wood, has managed to get by today, and with the help of God and my fellow alcoholics, I hope to get by tomorrow. The first order of business tonight is... - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
