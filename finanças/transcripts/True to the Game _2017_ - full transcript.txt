A few moves? I don't know who you talkin' to. - No, no, no. - I'm talkin' to you. - Like I said, a few. - No, it's all respect. I don't understand what this conversation's about. We respect what you're doin' in the streets. We just wanted - to say what's up. - I'm sorry, I don't know... what it is you think I do, but, ay, it was a pleasure to meet you. As-Salaam-Alaikum. All right? Turn up. Easy. I'm so over it. You rushed me to come here, now you rushin' me to leave. - Chill, we not leavin'. - Then why are we outside? We waitin' on Rasun and Quadir to come out. But you could've seen them inside. Mm-mm, then Rich Green would've seen me. - Who is Rich Green? - Did you see the scary lookin' guy with the beard? Girl, every guy in Philly got a beard. True. Well, I used to fuck Rich Green and I don't want Rasun to know. Rasun and Quadir are friends. That's why you gave him my shit. Now, I told him your name. I can't help he texted Quadir. Come on, here they come. - Just let them take us. - I gotta go to church in the morning, why you... Hey, so they about to bring the car around. What y'all tryin' to get into? Ay, man, you know what they tryin' to get into. - I say we ride home with y'all. - I like that. Because it's too late to get on the train, right? It's too late, it's too late. You famous, motherfucker! Yeah. Teach yo' ass, nigga. Oh my God, this is so good. Yeah, nothing works up an appetite like being shot at. You know, Gena really loves lobster. - Is that right? - Mm-hm. Well, you should, uh, come down to... to the restaurant. My chef makes a... wonderful lobster. - You've got your own restaurant? - Who, my man Qua? He got the hottest restaurant in the city. Oh, we already in there. - Ain't that right, Gena? - Yeah, maybe. Mm. I gotta go to the ladies' room, like, now. - Gena? - I'm good. I gotta go, too. Okay. Why does it gotta to be so much killin' out there? Why you talking to me like I'm responsible? I'm just sayin'. Sorry. - It's crazy to me. - It is. What are you gonna do about it? - Me? - Yeah, you. I don't know, that's up to the politicians. - I'm still in school. - Oh, you in school? - What you majorin' in? - English literature. - You tryin' to be a writer? - I am a writer. - Let me read some of your work. - I'm sorry, I don't let strangers read my work. You do know that when you sit down and break bread with somebody, technically you're not a stranger anymore? Listen, Quadir, you seem like a really nice guy. I appreciate dinner. You taking us home is really nice, but I know what you do. - Oh, do you? - Yes, - and I've been there before. - Mm. And I know most girls would just take the money. So, you think... you think... you think that I care more about what's in between your legs than... Come on, we both know you're not interested in reading my work. All you wanna do is hit and that's good for you. But, that's not who I am. Okay? Thank you for keeping it 100. I appreciate that. I don't hide what I do. It was a conscious decision. I'm a young, black, successful criminal. Yeah, that's what I do. That's not who I am. I love reading. I love music
