[somber music playing] [overlapping chatter] [camera shutter clicks] [whistling] [camera shutter clicks] [siren blares] [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] [clanks] [camera shutter clicks] [overlapping chatter] [camera shutter clicks] [glass shatters] [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] [glass shatters] [camera shutter clicks] [somber music playing] [ominous music playing] Get Julius on the phone. The sponsor's got an issue with sharing the page. Eugene. Yeah, uh, I'm supposed to meet Julius. I'm Anne Kellan, the editor. You won't be meeting him. He said on the phone that, um... [Anne] We won't be publishing these. You have a child overdosing, an elderly woman being bashed and this, a girl either being sexually assaulted or prostituting herself. I spoke to Julius and... You're speaking with me. This is voyeurism and exploitation. You waited and you photographed people at their most vulnerable, clearly from a hidden vantage point. Where I come from, this stuff happens every day. I... I didn't cause it. No. You waited in your hiding spot like a stalker for it to happen. I want to speak to Julius. Don't ever come back here. Don't you ever send us anything again. [car rumbling] [William] Gene. Gene. G... Gene. Gene. Gene. I can't bloody breathe, mate. That tank is good for another week. It's not working. It's working properly. It's not bloody working. [sighs] Dad, if you just... If you just calm down, you'll have more than enough for tonight. We'll... I'll get you another one tomorrow. I can't bloody breathe, mate. Oh, I need your help. [breathing heavily] Let me check the tube. [breathes heavily] Get out! And don't touch that, for God's sake! It's keeping me alive, you bastard. Go away. I need to check the tube to see if it's pumping air. [whimpers] I need more oxygen. I wish you'd bloody understand. [crying] [breathing heavily] [crickets chirping] [thuds] [nurse 1] He needs to stop doing this. Eugene, you have to make him stop doing this. [footsteps scraping] [car rumbles] [crickets chirping] [indistinct chatter] [thuds] [ominous music playing] [muffled indistinct chatter] [thuds] [crickets chirping] [creaking] [thuds] [crickets chirping] - [Mikhail] Halt. - [Josephine] [Foreign language]. [muffled indistinct chatter] [Josephine grunts] [panting] - [Mikhail] Give me that arm. Arm. - [Josephine] [Foreign language]. [Josephine] [Foreign language]. - [camera shutter clicks] - [Mikhail] Oh, shit. [crickets chirping] [phone crackles] [phone dials] [phone ringing] [operator] What is your emergency? Police, fire, or ambulance? Police. - [operator] Where is your emergency? - 69 Rose Street. [operator] And what is your emergency? I... I think they're running a... An illegal brothel out of there. [operator] What makes you think that? There... There are these men, they... They took teenage girls and they... They looked like they were drugged. Look, just send a car around. [thuds] [phone dialing] [line ringing] [Caitlin] Welcome to Slipstream, Caitlin speaking. How may I help you? Hello. Um, my name is Eugene Millard. [stutters] I'd like to speak to Julius, please. [Caitlin] I'll see if he's available. What is the reason for your call? I've sent in some photographs. [mellow music playing on the line] [Caitlin] Sorry, he's in a meeting. Can I take a message? Uh, I did want to speak to Julius. He said that there was a good chance that you would publish my photos. [Caitlin] I can put you through to our editor. No! [mellow music playing on the line] [thuds] - [Polly] Hello. - Hello. Yes, my name is Eugene Millard. Uh, I wanted to speak to Julius, please. [Polly] He's busy. Perhaps I can help. Uh, yes, um, Julius did say that there was a... A good chance that my photos would be published. [Polly] What was your name again? Eugene... Millard. [mellow music playing on the line] Hello. Hello. [thuds] [Polly] Hello, Eugene. Hello. Yes. [Polly] I found your file. Uh, yes. Uh... Like I said, I... I did speak with Julius. [Polly] I'm reading Anne's notes. This is so rude, voyeurism. I mean, if you're going to be a street photographer, they're not gonna pose for you, are they? - Hello. - [Polly] Okay. They're good. They are? [Polly] They're confronting. That seems to be the consensus. Um, I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. [Polly] I'm sorry. Polly. Oh, Polly. Uh, yes, uh, Julius did say that he might publish them. [Polly] I'll be honest with you. Anne's basically a feminist on crack. Reading through her notes again and what she's written here, the bit about rubbing people's noses in it, well, from what I can see, I sort of agree. There's no way in for the viewer. If there's some hope to... To go with that, a contrast for the griminess. [somber music playing] Eugene? I think I might have something. [Polly] Really? You know, we can meet. Can you get to the graveyard? Funky little bar in St. Kilda. Meet me tomorrow at 5:00 p.m. [mellow music playing] Eugene? Polly. So, you are the man who took these? Yeah. Well, they're very good. Look, I spoke with Julius and he was keen but with reservations. And, unfortunately, for you, there's Anne, the gatekeeper of art. I'm not the first guy to take pictures like this. No. No, you're not. So, why take them? That's what it's like there. Well, what... Why stay there if it's so bad? I look after my dad. He's sick. Look, lady, sometimes in life, you just look around and wonder how the hell did I get here. You've heard of Caroline Doyle? That, uh, 24-hour news channel. We were friends from primary school to journalism school, now she's on TV five nights a week and I am an assistant to an art director who's five years younger than me, and that's being generous. Do you have the other image? Uh... Do you know her? No. Why her? I don't know. See, you have to work on your spiel. The Annes of the world are gonna attack you, call you a stalker, or I don't know, whatever. I didn't stalk anybody. Every shot I've ever taken would had happened whether I'd had taken it or not. Well, did you stalk her? No. She just seems like someone you'd want to save. See, that's good. And she is a way in for the viewer. Can you get more images? - Yeah. - [Polly] You don't sound very confident. No. No. I... I can get more. Okay, this is what we're gonna do. More images, innocence lost, black and white, doing the... Yeah. - And you and me need to meet with Julius. - [glasses clink] Cheers! [thuds] [chuckles] [chortles] [mellow music playing] [crickets chirping] So much for the bloody cops. [door opens] [thuds] [grunting] [panting] Now, listen, my little Cherie, I'm taking you to hospital so they can fix the face. Don't give me any more trouble. And next time, we beat you and then no one want to fuck you. Then you know what's happened, right? Get in the van. [gasps] [grunting] Now, get in. [car door slides close] [car door opens] [car door closes] [ominous music playing] [car rumbles] [footsteps thumping] [nurse 1] No. You better not be here for more oxygen. Did... Did somebody bring in a... A teenage girl with a bruised face? Excuse me? Um, I think she's being kept prisoner. I have no idea what you're talking about. You should leave. His... His van is parked out the front. Look, if we ask questions, we're going to lose our licenses, okay? There is a doctor here I've never seen before, no paperwork, no records, someone connected up, let it go. I need to see a doctor. No, you don't. I'm having a heart attack. [clears throat] I need to see a doctor right away. [coughs] [nurse 1] Sit. The doctor will be here shortly. Don't go snooping around. [doctor] [Foreign language]. [Foreign language]. [Foreign language]. I'll kill her myself. [ominous music playing] [door slides open] [camera shutter clicks] [crickets chirping] Hey. Hey. Come on. [Mikhail] Hey! - [body thumping] - [Josephine grunting] [muffled grunting] He'll kill you. He's going to kill her. [Josephine wailing] [alarm ringing] What's going on? We have to evacuate. Get her out of here. - [alarm ringing] - [Josephine crying] [Eugene] Come on. Come on. [Mikhail] Hey! [grunts] [alarm ringing] [panting] [alarm ringing continues] [thuds] [alarm ringing] [ominous music playing] [Josephine] Stop. Look, I live near here. We can hide there. Why you have photo? Uh, magazine, Slipstream. They are going to publish my photos. With... With me? Yeah. - Tomorrow, we can go to the police. - No, I'm illegal. But you're a victim of a crime. I escape before, go to police, they deport me to immigration, but I not deport. [Eugene] I don't understand. Daddy owns your police, immigration. He just take me back. Who... is this Daddy? I never meet. He's boss, the czar. - But if you just disappeared... - I'm illegal. No one gives shit. [sighs] Here. [door clicks] [door closes] I smoke? His breathing. This photo in paper... Shh! This photo in paper, magazine, you took that? Daddy can find me. It would be like clue. [William] Gene. Gene. Gene. Gene, mate. I've done it again, mate. [grunts] I made the bloody disgrace, I know. Give us a hand, man. Come on, I got to get to the bloody bathroom. Oh, Gene. Oh, come on. - Give us a hand. - Just get up. [William] Take one arm, mate. Oh, my God! Oh! Sorry, mate. [inaudible]. Oi, you alright? [Eugene] Oh, oh, Come On, Come on. Come on. [William] Take these pants off. Oh, mate. - You do the undies mate. - [Eugene] Oh, jeez! [inaudible]. [water running] Okay. You have a problem. I go. No, wait, wait, wait. [sighs] The magazine, it... I'm meeting with them tomorrow, come with me. It'd be safer than staying here. Do you make money off this? Yeah, hopefully, it gets sold at exhibitions. Then what? [water running] [inhales] Put him in a home. Get out of this shithole. Okay. What then? Well, what do you mean? Your dad die, maybe soon. Then you leave anyway. Why take photo of bad thing? [eerie music playing] [Josephine] Pretty. Clean country, eh? [sighs] What country are you from? [scoffs] Not one you want to photo. I heard they called you Cherie. Josephine. Jo. Jo is man's name. Josephine. Josephine. I give a shit. And if we can get this photo... to this magazine, someone else will give a shit. [train swooshing] [train chugging] Who taught you English? My mother, part French [inaudible]. Where is she? Don't ask. [breaks screech] [train hisses] Sorry. [train swooshing] [train chugging] Your father, what is his name? [Eugene] William. And your mother? She died. How? Giving birth. [inaudible]. And from X-Files. What? [Josephine] I learn. The show? You learned English from the show? It's a good show. [train screeching] [door opens] [Eugene] Uh, hi. This is Josephine. Jo, Polly. Don't call me Jo. Come in. I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't have... Ah, do you want to watch TV? I have Galaxy. We need to talk. - I smoke? - Uh, no. [sighs] I not smoke. [Polly] When I said bring more photos, I didn't mean bring your muse. They were holding her prisoner, selling her for sex. Oh, my God! This just gets better all the time. Eugene, Julius wants your photos. He wants to meet you. Wait, why did you bring her here? - Why didn't you go to the police? - She's already tried that. The pimp just got her back. He must have police and immigration officials on his payroll. And there's no way we're gonna get our photos published with a heat like that on them. How badly do you want this? - Badly enough. - Enough? Yeah, I want it obviously. Okay, then we're gonna keep this a secret for now. [traffic noises] [Julius] Ah, hello. - Hello. - Hey. Julius, Eugene, you meet at last. Um, Anne insisted on being here. - You said you would handle her. - I know. She just wants to ask a few follow-up questions. I mean, she's the editor, Polly. Alright, Eugene come on through. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Eugene, come on through, mate. Come on. Um, I believe you guys know each other. Alright. [sighs] Eugene, let me start off by saying that these images are as impressive as they are confronting. At most I believe they fit in with Slipstream's target audience, there are a few issues. See, I don't make all the decisions myself. Sponsors, artists, and, indeed, my co-workers all have a say in the final product. Now, having said that, if these images were published, what primarily would you want to get out of it? Just to leave. [Julius] To... To leave... Leave. What... You mean your neighborhood? - Yeah. - [Julius] Oh. Yeah, he looks after his father who is elderly and sick and he wants to put him in a home. You didn't ask him that, did you? [phone ringing] Eugene, I'm a mother. I'd like to know why you took these photographs at all. I saw it happening. I took 'em. People don't have to look at them if they don't want to. [somber music playing] [Anne] Who is this girl? [Eugene] I don't know. Is she underage? [Eugene] I think so. You think so? [Polly] Anne, they're street photos. Do you want him to ask for ID? Mm-Hm. Street, they're not on the street. Really, hmm? I can't see that, can you? Um... What was she doing when you photographed her? Uh, who cares what she was doing? [Anne] I am wondering why she isn't getting screwed or OD'ing like everyone else you shoot. Where I live, that's all there is. [Anne] Why her? [Eugene] I'm trying to help her. Excuse me? What he means is, he's exposing a reality that no one knows about. Wait, wait, wait, Polly. Is that what you mean, Eugene? Yes, Eugene, are you helping her by including her with your other smut? - Hey! - [Julius] Hey, Anne, enough. She's basically a child. - They were selling her for sex. - Oh, fuck! I had to help her. And how exactly are you doing these? She thinks that no one cares. And if she was in this magazine, that might change. Exactly! Do you have her consent? Well, legally, we don't need her consent. Can you see further than your own nose? People will ask, "Who is this girl? How does her family feel about it?" And we say, "Oh, she's a 15-year-old hooker on the street. It's all good." If you're hypocritical enough to bring morals into it, it's ourselves who are having our own moral positions challenged. Oh, that is good. Now, that's good. We can use that. Eugene, we would need to meet her and make sure she was on board if... Oh, she's totally fine with it. - Oh, okay. - You're not serious about this? Yeah, actually I am. Yeah. Oh, sorry, Anne, if you wanted your publicity served up on a silver platter. Stop, stop, timeout. This meeting's over, okay? Eugene, I'm gonna confer with my co-editors and then we'll have a decision pretty quick, okay? Thank you so much for coming in, very talented man. Polly. Anne, can you lock up, please? I said a few follow-up questions, not the whole bloody Spanish Inquisition. [sighs] Not one for sticking to the plan, are you? I hate to tell you, but people who are a lot less nicer will ask you the same questions. - Hey, Gene, are you listening? - Yeah. From now on, just stick to the plan, get more shots of her and when you do your darkroom magic, make her the centerpiece. Okay. Um, I need to go home. You tell Jo. Perhaps, you better go back inside and smooth things over. Oh, no shit, Tonto! [car door opens] - [car door closes] - Hey. Daddy want to see you, huh. [car door opens] [grunts] [thuds] [car door closes] [ominous music playing] What did Cherie tell you about me? Just that she's never met you and that she heard you're a big criminal. [moaning] Do they know you're filming them? Well, they probably suspect it by now. Still we're all in this together. Which brings me to the salient point, what do you want with my Cherie? Photographs. Photographs? I take photos and I, um... I took some of her and a magazine, an art magazine, they want to publish them. [moaning] [chuckles] Honestly, I wouldn't have believed any of this bullshit unless it was really happening. [Eugene] Where'd you get those? I prefer video myself. Where did you get those? [thuds] See, oxygen ran out. We called ambulance, but, uh, too late. It's mercy killing. [chuckling] [ominous music playing] [Daddy] That was four days without water. Do you think you can last for that long? If you kill her and me, everyone will know. People that have met with us, they'll wonder where we are. She won't be just another m-missing hooker. She will be just another m-missing hooker 'cause she's just a fucking hooker, mate. They go missing all the time. You've got other girls; you don't need her. You planning on making any money out of these things? Now, you see you can't be taking what I make money off and using it for yourself. It just isn't fair. How much is she worth to you? Five grand, ten? Twenty? Yeah, twenty sounds good. I don't have $20,000. Yeah, I think your photos will sell for that much. They gotta be published first and then... And then they go to exhibition. They get sold at exhibitions. [chuckles] Eugene, isn't it? I love you, mate. You're very special. I want 20 grand by the end of the week. I can't get that. Here's a tip. There's a little place I know, it's called the Willow Brook. It's a hotel. Room 23 is the one we use occasionally, isn't it, Mik? [Mikhail] Mm-Hm. Perfect place for you and her to make some money. Now, I'm gonna be sending the boys around same time next week to collect and you better have that money or you will both run out of water. [jarring indication] [tires screech] [Mikhail] See you next week, huh? [grunting] [screams] [car revs] [tires screech] [panting] [groaning] [panting] [somber music playing] [train approaching] [Polly] Yeah. No, I understand, Julius, but I still don't understand why she had to be at the meeting. It's between the three of us. Look, I... I get that. I know, but... Hang on. How'd it go? Great. [door opens] Um, sorry, that was... That was Eugene. [door closes] Daddy found us. - I must leave. - No. He will just find us again. I had to do a deal with him. Twenty thousand dollars in one week for you. You met Daddy? Are you gonna get money? [grunts] I wish I never met you. - I'm going. - No. No. He'll just catch you again and... Remember as I said before, controversy sells. - You're going to make a lot of money through Slipstream... - Get it from them. They'd wanna know why and if I tell them about Daddy, probably call the police and they definitely wouldn't publish. Photos. Photos. [sighs] If we could just pay this bastard off, then you'd go in the magazine, tell your story to the world. See how powerful he is when... When everyone knows who he is. Daddy is czar. You are a bummed-out man. They killed my dad. This prick even suggested that I... That I pimp you to get the money. Blonde, tell me about me today. She ask I agree for photos be in magazine. She worse than you. [scoffs] But still, I agree. But now we go get money for Daddy. You a man before, you want to win. Now, you're just a bum. You ask. [somber music playing] Will you do it? Will you? Okay, yeah. [car horn honks] Cash. [man 1] Room 23, please. Hurry up. [footsteps thump] You don't expect me to do this just by myself. You go first. Take a breadstick. [indistinct chatter] What are you doing? [muffled conversations] [man 2] What do you have? - [woman 1] Come on, come on. - [man 1] I got the cash, man, so... - How much... How much you got? - Yeah, you fucking give me everything you've got, man. - You fucking give... - [man 2] How much have you got? I got fucking 150. That's all because she's fucking taken it. She's been pissing me off so... This will help. I can't do this. I do it, you do it. Couldn't I just... Couldn't I just wait outside the room? No, I need protection. You must be in here. [rustling] Okay, sometimes get sicko. Now I yell, "Eugene, Eugene. Help, help." Only that, nothing else. You run in with bat, maybe hit on legs, but not on the head. Not on head, okay? [groans] I can't watch you do this. You already watch with camera. But that's different. So, watch with camera then. Must have money, okay? You're a man, good man, but still a man. - [Josephine] Like it hard? - [man 3] I prefer it hard. I prefer it pretty hard. You too? - [man 3] Yeah. - Yeah? Maybe I can do something. Sure. [chair thuds] [somber music playing] [man 4] Oh, yeah. [moaning] [moaning] [moaning continues] [man 5] You fucking whore. [moaning] [cackling] [moaning] [inaudible]. [camera shutter clicks] [moaning] [man 6] Getting fucked. Is that what you like? [moaning] [moaning] - Why didn't you let me stop it? - [Josephine] I'm not in trouble. Better me than normal people. Don't show these photos to Blonde, okay? Why? I would have stopped him, you know. [whimpers] Dodola. [Eugene] Goddess. Of rain, and protect young girls. From my mother. In town, most beautiful girl with flowers and leaves, all the other girls go with her from house to house singing to Dodola. [scoffs] You were that girl? [chuckles] No, I'm too ugly. I'm in chorus. Why me? Why photo me? You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. [somber music playing] [birds chirping] [girl 1] Dad, can I please have chocolate ice cream? Please, please. I will eat my dinner. I will. - I promise, I will. - I'll bring it back home. But it will melt if you bring it back home. Please. - Come on, Dad, please. - Come on. - [Eugene] They're not here. - What? The... The photos. They... They... They're not in the next edition. [thuds] We talk to Blonde later. We take money to Daddy now. No. No. [sighs] You wait here. I'll take the money. [somber music playing] - [tire screech] - [body thumps] [grunting] [jarring indication] [thumps] [scoffs] [Eugene] How did you get those? [Daddy] The same way I get everything. [clanking] [sighs] Those are interesting. [water pouring] - It's all there. - [Daddy] Certainly is. [glasses clink] [lip smacking] Of all the freak shows I've ever done, the weird shit to my girls, you're the first one that has ever wanted to show it to the world. Money. [scoffs] When you sold some slut for $20,000 and all of a sudden, you have it worked up, "Chronicler of the Oppressed." I'm not like you. You know what the difference between prostitution and marriage is, don't you? Hooker makes you pay before the sex. Some people think there's something vaguely wrong in all this. They can't quite put their finger on what it is because they're all in denial about the fact that we're just fucking animals. I think it's selling teenage girls for sex. Hmm. Do you know that one of the sponsors of Slipstream is owned by me? What did you do? Hmm. You want to hone my Cherie sunshine. Even for art, you're gonna have to pay for it. I don't have any more money. I'll take 50,000 every week in rent. I can't get that. I know. [tires screech] [suspenseful music playing] Mmm. [glass thuds] Oh. - [sighs] - [Josephine] What happened? Now, he wants 50,000 in a week. - We must escape. - [Eugene] No. You need to get on TV. What? Polly has a friend, who hosts a TV show. You need to go on and tell her about Daddy. How does this help? [Eugene] We stick to the plan. We expose Daddy by putting you out there in the public. You do this with me? [Eugene] Mm... No. You must do this with me. [scoffs] Do you think that if people see me, it's going to help? You must come with me and say I'm not whore. She'll carve me up. You'll be fine. You're the victim. You... You want your photos on TV, but not you. You gutless, standing in room with camera while I fuck. I'm going to take you with me. I promise, but this is the only way. Tell them about Daddy, the house, the police, the... The immigration, but... But nothing else. Whoa! Whoop. [giggles] Hey, kids. [glasses clink] Wow, this dinner was meant to be a celebration. Woo! [Polly sighs] I'm sorry about the photos. There was a problem with a sponsor and that was all that bitch Anne needed to talk Julius out of it. [sighs] Basically, he said they weren't worth the hassle. I know it sounds sick, but what we need is something that he can't afford to ignore. What about your friend in the media? If Caroline Doyle wanted to interview you, those photographs would have had to have created a shit storm. Wouldn't she do it as a favor for a friend? She's a TV star first. Anyway, there's no story. Christ! There's not even a magazine article. There is a story, big one. Go on. You do it. I have a choice now? [Eugene] Polly will tell you the same thing. [cheering in background] I can't be there. Will you go on TV and tell them about Daddy? [somber music playing] [Polly] Now, when you meet her, she's gonna do this whole caring and sharing routine, trust me, she is the most ambitious person you will ever meet. Remember, this is just an audition. I only told her that you and Eugene met through him photographing you, nothing else. Just stay on message, this is all about Daddy. If we get the network to get Caro to do a story on this, we can get exposures for the photos, get it in the gallery, make some money and you can get citizenship. [knock on door] Alright, let's do this. [footsteps thumping] Hey, hey, hey. [chuckles] It's so good to see you. Oh, um, this is her. Josephine, you are beautiful, even more so in color. You've found yourself in a strange world, haven't you? Not my idea. I'm sure it wasn't. Josephine, I'm sorry for the way the world has treated you, but here, you can be as open as you want. - Okay. - Okay. And I'm sure that Polly has explained that before we can even consider doing a proper interview, we need consent from a parent or guardian. Oh, we can save that for the interview. Okay, what do we think? Couch? Okay, Jo, can I get you to sit down so the guys can set up the place? Jo? Jo. Josephine. I'm sorry. Josephine. [clicks] [traffic noises] [door clicks open] [light clicks] - [door closes] - [footsteps approaching] [Eugene] Where's Polly? They go to TV studio. How did it go? Polly say maybe not use. What did you say? I try. I told them about Daddy. The hotel? [scoffs] I... I say other things too about you. I didn't mean to. I'm so sorry. [scoffs] - It's on me. - You had to make this work. [exhales] [sighs] What exactly did you say? [whimpers] This is not my fault. Ugh! [sniffles] [sobs] [somber music playing] [door opens] [door closes] [light clicks] [footsteps approaching] [loud thud] [Polly] Come on. [thumps] [sighs] [sighs] [scoffs] [sighs] [sighs] I suppose she told you that the interview didn't go as planned. Can you use it? I doubt Caroline will ever speak to me again. It's game over, man. [exhales] What did Jo say? Everything. We're fucked, completely fucked. We needed the money. I know, and there was only one way you could go through with it. I get it. It's not your fault, Gene, it's your muse. I'd like to see these photos. I promised her I wouldn't show anyone. She's revealed everything anyway. I mean, does it really matter? [keyboard clanks] [keyboard clanks] [keyboard clanks] [scoffs] This is it. This is exactly what we need. [Eugene] No. [Polly] Remember what I said about images that Julius can't ignore? Daddy will block them. Well, Slipstream, yes. But if we take these to an exhibition, the publicity will come to us. You showing? These are very good, Josephine. You promised. [Polly] You made some promises, too. [footsteps thump] [gasps] You cannot show. I'm not whore. You promised. These images are the last roll of the dice. You could show others, not this. - [Polly] Do you want to know what she said? - No, no. Please not. [clanking] They put me in house with other girls, Asian, African, all illegal like me. They give us drugs and men come for sex. I escape, go to police, immigration, Daddy get me back. And Daddy is still looking for you now? Yeah. Then why hasn't he recaptured you? I saved by a man. This... This is the photographer? [Josephine] It's right. [Caroline] You said that you were imprisoned. What were the circumstances of him photographing you? He want to pay for photograph. Personally, I have a lot of trouble with a man paying a girl in such vulnerable circumstances as yours for photographs. He... He's sicko. [Caroline] A sicko? And how did the man that you just described get you away from this seemingly all-powerful criminal? To get away from Daddy, Eugene buy me. [Caroline] Buy you? Did you know about this? [Polly] Hell, no. Daddy say, every week now, Gene pay money for photo be in magazine. How did he get the money to buy you? By whoring. I need protection. So, Eugene in next room with baseball bat. He was watching you having sex? To watch, he must photograph. - Polly? - [Josephine] He loves me. He's a sicko, he loves me. [static noise] That not happen. I not say that. [whimpers] I mean, I say it, but... [foreign language]. [Eugene screams] Show the images. Eugene, you... You promised to take me away. [breathes heavily] We need to get those photos out. Not these, if you love me, no. What, that I'm a sicko and you're a whore? I am not say that. Sure you did. We all know what this is. [inhales deeply] Eugene, you're a good man. You say I'm beautiful. [Polly] Gene. You don't know me. You don't know what I have been through. Blonde is not your friend. I am friend. I picked you because you looked into the lens, the whore who looked into the lens, my Josephine, just a whore who looked into my lens. I whore for you. You played me. You had nothing. These images are going out and I am going to get mine. Okay. [whimpers] I go. Maybe Daddy get me. [breathes heavily] [inhales deeply] [footsteps thumping] [thumps] I am your friend. I hope you get what you want. [somber music playing] [door opens, closes] Tonight is the beginning of you getting the credit you deserve. These photos take off, Julius has promised to make me editor. We can publish anything you want. I mean, there's no reason you can't photograph other things. You feel bad about it, don't you? You're not a bad man. I mean, you tried to help her. If anything, she manipulated you. [sighs] [Polly scoffs] [gulps] Can't do it. What? No, I can't do it. Um, keep driving. Yeah, around the back. Jules, yeah, we're making a detour. Um, yeah, meet us around the back. Yeah, left here. [car rumbling] Ah. Polly. - Hi. - Hey. - Come on. - You guys are late. Come, Eugene. How are you? [Polly] Come on. Take a seat. Take a seat. Alright, he stays here. I'm gonna mingle a little bit first. Is he okay? I mean, he doesn't look that great. - We're gonna have a Q&A but he's... - No, he's fine. Just remember, no one speaks to him but me. Well, it's okay. No one knows who he is, do they, Polly? [laughs] Eugene. Eugene. I just want to let you know, I will defend your right to show these images, okay? So, the thing is, when these images are published, the people that we are gonna be most confronted are the ones that are facing their own darkness, okay? Just remember that and you'll be... Yeah, alright. Just remember that you need to stay, okay? [door opens] [door closes] Okay, thanks. [door opens] [footstep thumping] As I said, I want nothing to do with those images out there. [clatters] You get one look at this tape, then I'm destroying the footage. If either of you ever say anything about this to anyone, I will sue you for defamation. And how did the man that you just described get you away from this seemingly all-powerful criminal? [Polly] Jo. [Caroline] Josephine, you have nothing to be ashamed of. I not say it. [Polly] What? [Caroline] How did he do it? [Polly] I don't know. Just tell her, we need to move on. I promise Eugene, I not say. [Caroline] What did he do? [Polly] Kid, just tell her. How bad could it be? [Caroline] You know what, Polly, I don't think we should continue. She's fine. Josephine, you need this. We need this. Just... just tell her. To get away from Daddy, Eugene buy me. Buy you? Did you know about this? [Polly] Hell, no! Sweetheart, you've just put me in a big time, you, ah, better explain. Daddy say every week now, Gene pay money for photo be in magazine. How did he get the money to buy you in the first place? [Polly] Well, this has nothing to do with me. I... I had no idea what these two were up to. I... I would have stopped it immediately. Now, you started this, explain. [Caroline] How did he get the money to buy you? [Polly] Tell her what you and freak show cooked up. By whoring. You happy? I need protection. So, Eugene in next room with baseball bat. [Caroline] He was watching you having sex? [Josephine] To watch, he must photograph. [Caroline] Polly! [Polly] No, don't look at me. She said it herself. He is a sicko. Don't say sicko. [Polly] Well, you warped little freak, what would you call it? He loves me. He is a sicko, he loves me. [clatters] [footstep thumping] [door opens] [Eugene] Why are you showing me this? Why not show to Julius? Because he doesn't care. [footstep thumping] [muffled disco music playing] [overlapping chatter] [music intensifies] [gasps] I've already had several people bid for pieces, thousands of dollars. Let's do this. She'll sell for more than 50 grand now. [indistinct chatter] Tonight is the first exhibition of the photographer, Eugene Millard. [applause] What are you doing? Step forward. The tape, you fixed it. How could you do that to her? For God sakes, did I take these? [chuckling] I am not your whore. Get out there now. [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [footsteps thumping] [Eugene] Where's Caroline Doyle? Uh, she was here a minute ago. I think she's left. She wants to speak to you about as much as I do. I know how to find Daddy. He might have Josephine and I need Doyle's help. Come with me. I also need 50 grand in a week for Josephine. Get back up there, now. I have waited my whole life for this. You are nothing, nothing without me. You're not human. You don't even exist. You're nothing, you hear me? [ominous music playing] [Eugene] Anne. Your photographs are selling. Congratulations. Doyle have found out who Daddy is? Yes, yes. She must be able to interview both of you and you've got to tell her everything. The network will do its own investigation. Okay. You better get out of here. He'll be here soon. [car passing by] You don't even know if he's got her or if he hasn't killed her already. Then buy time for her death. Everyone will take that seriously. [ominous music playing] Wait here for five minutes, okay? Don't move. And, Anne, make sure Jo gets all of my money. [ominous music playing] [tires screech] [Daddy] Well, he's certainly not a quitter. [Mikhail] Yeah, we need to end this. You found a new source of income. Where is she? How do you know she's not dead? We had a deal. Yeah, I reckon you've got all the photos worth getting. Are we still playing the game? Search him. He's clean. Again. Oh, piece of shit! [grunting] Like I said, he's clean. When is this going to stop, huh? Eh, good point. Game over. No wait, wait. I want... I want sex. I want sex with her. Stop it. Stop. [whimpers] Please, Daddy. Let me do her just once. It's my thing. I want to watch it. I can't help it. Well, let's get the bitch to Room 23 then. [Mikhail] What, are you coming too? Well, it's been ages since I starred in a live show, Mik. [suspenseful music playing] Hello. I get a tape, right? Yeah, of course. But you got to make it look real good. [Eugene] What do you mean? Well, I don't want statutory rape, I want real rape. You're gonna split that bitch in half. You're gonna make a tape you're never gonna want to show to anyone. Now, get your clothes off. Why? Do what you're told, asshole. [sighs] [unzips] Enjoy the ride. [ominous music playing] You're a man now? You are not man. [thumps] [panting] Get away! Get away! Get away! Ah! [panting] [body thuds] Stop it. Ah! No! [screams] [panting] [screams] [screams] [panting] [Foreign language]. [whimpers] [both grunting] [screams] Stop it. [crying] Get away! Get away! Stop it! [grunting] [groaning] Fucking asshole! You fucking asshole! [sighs] Help me, huh? [moaning] [Foreign language]. Fucking asshole. [crying] [grunting] Please stop. Stop it. [sobbing] [both screaming] Stop. - [crying] - [groaning] [grunting] [both panting] [crying] I promise I'm gonna get you out of this. [mellow music playing] [news anchor 1] The artist's source of inspiration may be more than we are ready for. [news anchor 2] He is worse than the men who paid her for sex because he did nothing. [news anchor 3] There's no artistic merit. [news anchor 4] This is the complete erosion of childhood. [news anchor 5] How a teenage girl selling herself for sex can be considered art? [news anchor 6] How could she live like this? [news anchor 7] It's going to be [inaudible]. [news anchor 8] The work has intrinsic value whether the creators themselves are deviant or whatever you want to call it or not. [news anchor 9] Absolutely revolting. - [news anchor 10] My gosh. - [news anchor 11] Where does it lead? [news anchor 12] He should be arrested for pimping her. It's not so much the sexual, but more the power, rubbing our noses in it. [camera shutter clicks] [news anchor 13] I've seen the photos on the net and I nearly puked. [news anchor 14] I don't need a church or a government or anyone else to tell me how I should think. [camera shutter clicks] [birds chirping] [shoes squeaking] [ball thuds] [somber music playing] [mellow music playing]
