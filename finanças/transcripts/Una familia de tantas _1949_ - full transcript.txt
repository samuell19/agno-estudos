The digitization of this film was made from... ...the acetate 35mm positive copy by... ...Laboratorio de Restauración Digital de la Cineteca Nacional. The material has an advanced state of deterioration: Film shrinkage, deep scratches, emulsion and image loss... ...mechanical damage and stains from the development stages. In spite of the digital process some damages persist. However, the historic relevance of "A Family Like Many"... ...and its director, Alejandro Galindo... ...make it a film worthy of broadcasting. A FAMILY LIKE MANY I heard you the first time... Estela... Estela! It's time and dad will be using the bathroom. I'm coming. Let me sleep a little longer. Ok, but don't say I didn't tell you. Lupita, come on...get up. Girls! Yes, mommy. Hurry up, your father is almost getting up. Yes, mommy, we're getting dressed. Well, hurry up or you'll be late. Yes, mommy. Mom. Dear, I'm not going out. Stay with your sister. Maru! Take your brother. I have to make breakfast for your father. Come on, Angel, you still haven't washed your face. Go down and ask Guadalupe to put more wood into the water heater. When are you coming out? Guadalupe! Coming! Coming! I'm not deaf! - Put more wood in the heater. - It's already hot. - Well, keep putting in wood. - OK, I'll feed it until it blows up. Are you planning on growing old in there? You're not on holiday, you know? Just a minute! I'm coming, man. Let me know when you're done, I'm going to sleep a little more. No way! If you fall asleep again... By the time he comes out... Come on in. You see? Finally! We were growing old. When will you learn to wash the tub? Just look! I just let the water out and you were in such a rush... Hey! Can't you see I'm combing my hair? Can't you step back? You look the same. Hey! Just look at the grime. By the time you wash the tub, I could have slept some more. Why don't you get up earlier? Step aside. You're so selfish. Stop primping, you would think you were going to a dance. OK, get out. I'm going to undress. You see? By the time you finish bathing, I could have slept... My shirt! Move! Have you gone crazy? Hector pushed me. - Look what you've done. - That's what you get! What's the meaning of this? What's all the racket? What are you doing in here with them? I'm about to leave, dad. That's no excuse. I've told you to stay out of the bathroom when your brother is in there. He was already dressed, daddy. That doesn't matter. Everyone out! Come on! What are you waiting for? Get out. You act like a kid when you should see that my orders are followed. They almost knocked the door down, I thought they could fill the tub... Then you leave the door open! Not shut yourselves in as if you were doing something wrong. Very well, dad. May I leave now, dad? Don't go. I want to talk to you. Close the door. What happened last night? Why did you get home so late? There was a difference and I couldn't leave until it matched. What entry showed a difference? Disbursements. Did you run your cash register receipts first? Yes, but it couldn't be that. The petty cash doesn't register amounts over $50 pesos. And the difference was 3,636.36. Was it more or less? More. It's obvious. The mistake was the machine's, right? That is so, dad. It's simple. 3,636.36... 3 thousand 6 hundred... ...a 3 then a 6, then 36 and 36 cents... ...the machine repeated the figure. - Yes, dad. - You see? Will they ever learn? Before checking receipts you have to study the characteristics of the difference. He pushed me and I fell and then... Stop it. You shouldn't be in the bathroom when your older brother is bathing. Mister Hector asked me to cook his eggs with green salsa. Go figure... Can't you be still? Salsa this early? I can't understand it. We'll never finish. That's what I say, because you know he was late. Yes, he had to work late. But who knows, Doña Gracia, young people at that age... Come on and have your oatmeal. Maru, can I borrow your blue dress? Mister Hector is old enough to be doing things. Come on, Guadalupe, put more wood in the heater. Whatever you say. Maru... Help me with the chair... - So, Maru? - What? Can I borrow your blue striped dress? It doesn't fit you any more. Wait. I only say this because I am fond of Mister Hector. Stop grumbling and hurry up, the master will be down soon. You don't want to see it, Doña Gracia, but young people now... ...are not the same as they used to be. Is that a "yes"? Pass me the sugar. Hurry up, Angel. Is that a "Yes"? Yes, OK. Watch it! Guadalupe, my breakfast. Can I get it now? Yes, but don't mess up my things. No, I won't. - Watch where you're going, child! - Yes, mommy. Where are you going? Sorry, daddy. You're always running, you'll fall down. No, daddy. Are you nuts? No one will beat you to the bathroom now... I'm getting the blue dress. Maru lent it to me. OK, but wash the tub. I had to wash it twice. Can you believe it? A letter of demands... ...asking for a 60% raise. "The division had not reached an agreement by closing time... ...the Secretary of Labor said that in the event of..." Morning, mommy. You'll be late again and that isn't right. Just because you work for your uncle... ...doesn't mean you can be late, on the contrary. My uncle comes in late and he told me I could be... ...10 or 20 minutes late, that I didn't need to... Talking of being late, I'm off. - Dad. - Goodbye, son. Here I am, Guadalupe. You shouldn't take him up on it even if he told you so... ...you should learn to be organized. Daddy, when I turn 15 can I work? I would say no, child. Your mother needs you here. Guadalupe, I think that is something I should decide. I just think that the girl is better off at home... ...than running after buses and locked in an office. I'm not a child anymore. I'm going to be 15... ...and I can have a boyfriend and work, right, Estela? Maru, your sister is not the one to judge that. Yes, mommy. When you turn 15, we'll talk. As for you, Estela... ...your boyfriend left at 9:10 yesterday... ...and both of you know he is allowed to visit from 7:30 to 9:00. Yes, dad. Maybe he didn't notice. Then we must change the clock's chimes so you both notice. Make sure these kids pay attention. Yes, Rodrigo. I'm leaving, the hour has chimed. - Hurry up. I don't want you to be late. - No, dad. - See you later, daddy. - Goodbye, child. - Aren't you going to school? - Yes, daddy. It's half past, you should be on your way. - I was just leaving, daddy. - Where are your books? And you haven't had breakfast yet. Go get your books. As punishment for lying, no breakfast. Get a note from the Headmistress stating the time you get there. - Gracia. - Yes, Rodrigo. - That child will go without breakfast. - Yes, Rodrigo. Go on, eat this quickly and then go. It wasn't my fault. I wouldn't be late if I hadn't gotten wet. Hector pulled me. OK, Lupe, eat your bread. No, I'm not taking that one. Here's your coffee, Lupita. You can't leave without something hot in your stomach. - It has sugar. - What about mom? Didn't say anything. She sweetened it herself. Yes, child, yes. See you later, mommy. God bless you and don't forget to bring me two needles... ...because I broke one and tell your uncle to call your father... ...and God protect you from a premature death. Amen. I'm going, mommy. I have to run to get the note. That's what you get for being so muddled... ...your father hates disorder and rushing... God protect you from a sudden and premature death. Amen. Aren't they pretty? Lovely. There were some prettier ones, but mom wouldn't let me get them because... What's wrong? What's the matter? I won't be able to call you my child anymore... ...you will be a young woman. Why not? I've always been a woman, now I will be a Miss. No, my child, you have always been a Miss and now you will be a woman. A woman? The things you say. I don't get you, Guadalupe. I can't explain it... ...it's not the shoes, or the 15th birthday... It's something you feel, another kind of feeling... ...something like... ...like wanting to be yourself... ...to live your own life, not you, child, but... Maru. - Yes, mommy. - Your siblings have left... What are these dishes doing here? - Take them down right away. - Yes, ma'am. ...your dad too. So I'm off to the market. I will be back at 11 sharp... ...don't forget to clean the sideboard. - But first I will do this room. - That's fine. - Ok, see you later, child. - Bye, mommy. I'm going to be a woman. Holly! It's half past and I am behind on my chores. Coming! Good morning, Miss. Good morning. Your mother, could I speak to her? My mother? You know, I brought her this. May I? I'm sorry, but my mom isn't home... But she won't be long, right? I'd be sorry not to complete my task. She's at the market, I beg you... Perfect! That gives me time to set up the machine and we'll surprise her. Excuse me, I don't understand. Did my mother order that? The company sent me to show this machine to your mother... ...but since you are cleaning... Put that down, Miss. When you see what this machine can do you won't want a broom again. We'll do the cleaning before your mother gets home Excuse me sir, but I think... Your mother won't recognize the place. I just want to point out its efficiency... ...besides the refinement of the cleaning. No one imagines all the dust and garbage we miss with the broom. Have you cleaned this room? Yes. Great, now you will see the efficiency of Bright O'Home. This bag collects all the garbage and dust... ...from furniture, curtains, rugs, corners. As you can see, it's completely clean and empty. Now watch everything the broom and dust rag left. It has an elbow tube for furniture, curtains, rugs... ...all kind of fine tapestry. I haven't touched that today... Besides, I can't reach it. I understand perfectly. You can't reach a lamp with a broom. We will clean it, better than with a brush. They won't recognize it. And in just two minutes... A sofa in just a moment. And you won't be fatigued at all... It's incomprehensible how some girls... ...still clean with brooms. Now, please come over here. We're going to open the bag so you can see for yourself... ...the amount of dust left behind by the brush. It's amazing. My goodness. All that dust came out? Look! The Holy Virgin! We've looked for her so. My sister Lupita lost it when she made her First Communion. And this note? Dr. Echenique's prescription. My goodness! For the pain my father gets. My mom was desperate. Two hairpins? Yes, but now we use bobby pins. - And this? - What is that? My Lord! Don't be afraid. It's dead. How filthy! Angel must've brought it home. He brings all sort of things. Yes, it is a lizard. I don't know what they're called, but Angel put it there... He puts everything in the sofa. Leave it. That was all we got from the sofa. Now let's groom it, we'll leave it as good as new. With this new attachment and a few drops of Shine O'Home, you'll see... Aren't you going to use this? No, not that. Would you like one? What are they? They're toffees. Milk and vanilla. Have one. They're delicious. This is like a shampoo for upholstery. Shine O'Home also works as a potent insecticide. Eliminating moths... ...or insects that could have been hiding in your furniture. It smells pretty nice. Done. We only need to wait a few moments. Meanwhile, let's clean the lamp. Would you turn it on, please? Press the little button. Oh no, my mother! Maru! What is the meaning of this? - What is this man doing here? - My name is Roberto del Hierro... ...representative of the Bright O'Home Machinery Corporation. - Yes, sir, but... - Mommy! Mommy! You don't seem to realize... I was just showing the lady our latest vacuum cleaner... Child, be quiet. And what is the matter with you girl? Talk. This sir was demonstrating his machine. We were just waiting for the sofa to dry. You can see the difference for yourself. Guess what? We found the virgin's medal and Dr. Echenique's prescription. You well know I don't make those decisions. Of course, ma'am, it must be your husband... But the housework is done by women, so the company suggests that we... ...show the equipment to you ladies... ...who can really tell the advantages of the vacuum... But... my husband is very particular. As is his right, ma'am. I respect that. If you like, I can leave the machine here... No, but... Excuse me. That implies no commitment on your part. You may use it today and tomorrow, as long as you like. And if you decide... But my husband must know about this today. Perfect! Then I shall come talk to him tonight. What time does he get home from work? At seven. I will be here at 9 sharp. I think that would be best, give him time to have dinner... Here is the instructions booklet. It explains the uses of the Bright O'Home. I won't distract you any longer. Test the machine and I'm sure you'll be the ones... ...to encourage the master of the house. Good day, see you at nine. He looks decent. Right, mom? Decent? Wait until your father finds out a man was here without his presence. With the new fiscal policy, we will have to change... ...our whole accounting system. That's what the government thinks. But as for us, I told the president: We should keep the books the same as always. We'll use the machines when the inspector's come. We haven't been a penny off in ...and we haven't had to change our system yet. Do they think machines can teach us to think? Or that they will find the differences? Rodrigo. I'm sorry to interrupt... ...but I have to tell you something... A young man came this morning, an agent. What did he bring? I don't know.... ...the thing is... I had gone to the market and Maru opened the door... This young man... What? I didn't know...first he asked for mom and I thought... Did he come in? When I went to open... I asked if he came inside. Yes, but he looked like a decent young man. Decent...How can you tell? Do you know him? Was he introduced or can you tell just by looking at people? No, dad, but he... Don't get upset, Rodrigo. I don't think he was disrespectful to Maru. How do you know if you were at the market? But he was still here when I got back. Really? And what were they doing? - He was cleaning the lamp. - Don't interrupt. I'm talking to your mother. You may continue. He was demonstrating a machine. A sweeping machine. Do you want to see it? You mean it is here? Where is it? In the living room. In the living room! Let's see what they have invented now to take women away from their homes. There it is, daddy, but look how clean the sofa is... He brought this booklet with the instructions. And why is it here? I imagine you didn't say you'd buy it. God forbid, Rodrigo. The young man insisted we use it and said he would come tonight to talk to you. Talk to me? What nerve! What time did he say? At nine. Nine, huh? The insolence! But this is Leopoldo's night. Well, tell him not to come. I must see this person. But I have nowhere to contact him. Then send him away early and tell him to come tomorrow. Let's go to the table. What is this? The instruction book that explains what the machine can do. Don't think you can go about naked like that cleaning! It's time for you to go to your rooms. This guy won't be long and I don't want anyone down here. I haven't finished my homework, Daddy. Finish it in your room. Go on. OK. I'll come say goodnight. Yes, dad. Estela, have you said goodbye to Leopoldo? Yes, Don Rodrigo, just now. You, go say goodnight to your daughters. Yes, Rodrigo. You have permission to visit tomorrow. Yes, Don Rodrigo, thank you. See you tomorrow. Yes, Don Rodrigo. See you tomorrow. Estela! Yes, dad. - Bye...see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Excuse me, father. Well, father, I will... You can stay. I'm going to say goodnight to your sisters. Yes, dad. I'll wait here. "Squash farming" Maru, how is "squash" spelled? Aren't you going to bed? Yes, daddy. I'm about to. I don't see you undressing. I always take off my shoes first. Estela takes off her dress first. All right, goodnight. Goodnight, daddy. I wrote it with a "q" and we'll see... I wonder how it'll go. He's such a decent boy. You shouldn't worry. What do you care? Go to bed. You don't need to wait up, it'll take me 10 minutes. Where are you going? Didn't you hear the bell? It must be him. Is Dad already downstairs? Good evening. Mr. Cataño? That would be my father. Come in. Thank you. I hope you have dined already. You're the machine guy, right? Yes, sir. From Bright O'Home. Sweepers, polishers... ...machines for the home. You may sit. My father is expecting you, he'll be right down. Perfect. I'm in no hurry. Do you smoke? Thank you. I don't smoke in front of my parents. There it is, eh? The M10. There are other larger models... ...but I think the M10 suits you. Nice book. It must be interesting. What is it about? "The Bookkeeping Master", by Morton. It must be my father. This is the guy from the machine, dad. Nice to meet you, I'm Roberto del Hierro... ...from the Bright O'Home Machinery Corporation. I was here this morning, as I believe your missus told you. Politeness is a virtue. And you brought the machine, right? Yes, sir, the M10. The best for a home like yours. I hope your wife shared her impressions. Young man, I want you to know that my daughter is a young lady... I'm sorry, sir. I fail to see the relevance. Bright O'Home is in the best homes and we have... I don't doubt it! But... You may haven't noticed my disapproval of the way you show its merits. Excuse me, Mr. Cataño, I am a novice, but my inexperience... ...as a salesman does not alter the advantages of the Bright O'Home... I'm not talking about that! I'm talking about how someone enters a home just like that... We're qualified to do that. Qualified? That's right, sir. To show how it works without deceit. Your wife and daughter must've... I forbid you to speak of my daughter! For the love of God! He'd better leave. Let's be clear, young man. Why did you enter this house without knowing a soul? I am sorry, Mr. Cataño... ...but the company hired me not to advertise myself but the machines... ...which is what should concern you. If the machine really is good... I don't care what you have to say! You have snuck into my house... Wait a minute. First of all, I didn't sneak into your home... ...your wife and your daughter received me... ...and tonight, he invited me in. Secondly, this is not the first house in Mexico I have entered thus... ...and in each one I have left a friend and a Bright O'Home. God only knows your intentions when the master of the house is absent. Jesus! What do you mean? Listen to me Mr. Cataño. If you wish to inquire about my honor ask my company. They know me well. I have worked for them for years. I am their best agent, you know? My mother was left a widow and I support her with my sales. I see no reason to offend me when I offer you something useful... ...and beneficial for your home. I don't doubt what you say. But it doesn't authorize you to violate our customs. Agreed. But custom isn't affected by taking care of the furniture. It would be a pity to ruin them. We drew almost a pound of dust from this sofa... ...and found Dr. Echenique's prescription which might have been needed. There are parts of the house the broom doesn't reach. Nor does the machine produce friction, hence it conserves the furniture. It seems he calmed him down. Now he should leave. Is he a fool? He won't even say goodbye. You don't know him at all. He's so decent. Paintings are cleaned with a special nozzle. What did he say? What are they talking about? Let me listen! You see? The color appears. Now it looks great. What is he saying? To whom is he talking? Shhh. He's showing it. - What? - I'll tell you later. Plus, with the Shine O'Home... ...the paintings will be free from moths and other pests. What is he talking about? Shine O'Home, a special shampoo for furniture. Shampoo for furniture...? That's the first I've heard... And there's more... Bright O'Home is useful for gentlemen too, it makes your clothing last longer. Brushes wear down more than they clean. Would you please take off your jacket? - What now? - My goodness. They're removing their jackets. It's not necessary. Glorify my soul. My spirit is filled with joy. You see? As good as new. The fabric wasn't disturbed at all... ... and the stains and dust were removed. Yes, I must admit it. The machine really does provide good service, indeed. A great service, Mr. Cataño. You may rely on that. Did you hear? The machine is off. Let him go now, for the love of God, before anything else happens. Here is the pen, Mr. Cataño. Down here, please. - What? - Let me hear. Perfect, Mr. Cataño. Thank you. Here is my card. If you need service for the machine... ...I can send a mechanic. - Your copy. - Thank you. Good night. What now? I think that was the best way to get rid of that upstart. It's better to buy the machine and avoid a scandal. He bought it. He sold it. Besides, your sister will be 15 soon... I would like to stay until nine. Let me through. I don't want to miss my dad dancing the waltz with Maru. Guadalupe! Child, for goodness' sake. My cake! My cake! What is it, child? To put the cake in the oven candles and all! My Lord! But with Estela here I don't know what side is up. I don't know how I could be in the way. I have to fix my hair. Mom, can I... Isn't this girl going to school? Dad gave me permission, and I want to stay for the party. - Mom - What? Say yes, mom! For the love of God be quiet! I can't hear myself think! - Mom. - Yes? - Can I invite Mr. del Hierro to my party? - Mr. del Hierro? - His machine improved the living room. - I don't know... - Shall I ask dad? - That'd be best. You'd better do it now, he's about to leave. - Please mom, just the waltz. - Enough! - Dad. - Yes. Daddy, I wanted to ask you... ...consult you about something. If you want... after all... Speak up, child, or I'll be late. I asked mom, and she said you should decide. What is it, child? - Um... It's about Mr. del Hierro. - Mr. del Hierro? Yes, may I invite him to my party? How could you think such nonsense? Have you gone crazy? - Alright, daddy, I'll tell mom. - Of course you will. I don't know how your mother thought you could ask me. She knows full well your cousin Ricardo arrives today... ...he came from his ranch solely for your party. - My cousin Ricardo? - Yes, you'll meet him... ...he's a young man of principle and impeccable family. - Uncle Ricardo's son? - Uncle Ricardo's son. Ricardo Cataño Leoniz, at your service. He's all grown up. I barely remember him. We were just kids. That's natural, cousin. But I do remember you. There's a picture at my house of us together. Well, you'll have time to talk later. Come in nephew. "And there she lay, in a pool of blood... ...forever silenced." - Young man! - "Forever sleeping." You with the poetry... Excuse me a moment. Introduce your cousin to your guests. Mr. Odorica - Nice to meet you, Ricardo Cataño. - Nice to meet you. - A neighbor. - Nice to meet you, Ricardo Cataño. - Mrs. Menchaca... my cousin. - Ricardo Cataño at your service. - The widow Rivero. - Nice to meet you, at your service. The Espinosa Ladies of the Congregation of the Holy Sheet and... ...the child saint of the Prague Temple. Ricardo Cataño Leoniz, at your service. Jovita Espinosa de los Rios at your service... ...at Corregidora 228 apt. 11, my house is yours. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Ricardo Cataño at your service. Maru looks very pretty, you must be proud, Rodrigo. Thank you, I confess that I am. Our children's achievements are the culmination of our efforts and sacrifices. - Don Rodrigo, is he your nephew or your wife's nephew? Mine, he is my brother's son. He doesn't live here. His father left him a cotton ranch, they became wealthy after the war... He only came for Maru's birthday. They've always loved each other. Tell me, Don Rodrigo... The time has come... Ladies and Gentlemen... Maru is going to dance her first waltz with her father, Don Rodrigo Cataño. Where's mom? - She has to see me dance with dad. - Of course, go get her. - Child, where have I put the salt? - Here it is. - Mommy, come! - What is it? What's the matter? Come, I'm going to dance with dad! Go ahead. What nerve. I think your place is in the kitchen. - Are you the owner of the house? - I wish I were, then you would see... I think so, don't you? Mommy. Oh, daughter, now you have become a woman. Yes, but a woman who adores the best mommy in the world! Alright... Now... I'm going to finish the croquettes. You should dance with your cousin first... ...after all, he only came for your party. Yes, daddy. She will dance with you later, boys. Do you want to dance? It will be the first one after dad. Of course, I'd be delighted. Hector, for the love of God! Have you gone crazy? They will see us. But in there I can't tell you what I want to say. What is it? Look... Let me go! Turn around. Let go of me! I don't like that! I'm going to get mad. Don't say that, please. Let me... Now it's ready. - Guadalupe, take the croquettes in. - Yes, ma'am. How nice! Please, Guadalupe, don't tell anyone. Why should I? She's not my daughter. Tell the guests to come to the table. But wipe your mouth first or they'll think a clown attacked you. Son, tell everyone to come to the table. Guadalupe, hurry up. Please come to the table, everything is ready. You sit there. You over there. Here so you can blow out your candles. Wherever you like. Make yourself at home. Pilar, where have you been? Everyone is seated. You had me worried sick. Scoundrel! I don't know whether to kill you or run away. I was afraid of that. Where were you? In the bathroom, silly. I went to freshen up. And don't talk to me. Ready. Maru, your father has something to say to you. - You, eat your cake and go right to bed. - Yes mommy. My dear daughter, I interrupt this humble gathering... ...of your family, friends and loved ones... ...to remind you that today on your ...unfortunately marks the end of your childhood... ...of those happy days of naivety and innocence. Days that are now behind us. From the moment you blow out those joyous candles... ...that shine so distant from my words... ...you will have become a woman. But first... It is my duty to tell you that your mother and I... are extremely proud... ...of the child who came to cheer this household 15 years ago. We have led you to the gateway of puberty... ...and we hope to continue to be proud of you... ...as a pure and good woman, modest and Christian... ...obedient and respectful to your parents... ...that by fulfilling the sacred duty... ...which consists in obeying our elders... This is the best reward for parents such as us... ...who have been patient, self denying... ...indulgent and understanding. It's just eggnog. So, my daughter, always keep that in mind... ...so you may enjoy the happiness your parents wish for you. I have spoken. Don't be silly, child. There's no need to cry. Go ahead and cut your cake. I'm going to have cake, too. Thank you. The lights! Please, don't keep me in this hell... Sunday at the picnic. You're coming, aren't you? Sunday and always. Bravo! Thanks a million. Goodbye, Maru. Thanks a million. Good night. It's my turn to say I hope you had a very happy day. Thank you, Ricardo, I appreciate your coming from so far. It's always a pleasure to see loved ones. You are so kind. Why don't you invite him to dinner before he leaves? Of course, stop by and we'll talk. With pleasure. I plan to stay a while in Mexico City. I'll come by. Make it soon, cousin. - Fine. See you soon. - See you soon. God bless, son. You know this is your house. Thanks. Good night. Good night. OK, it's time to turn in. Ricardo is a good boy, earnest, proper... What did you think of him? I'm dead! And these shoes are killing me! Maru! How dare you take off your shoes? Can't you see there are men present? But, they were killing me, the high heels... It doesn't matter! Virtue is the fruit of sacrifice. And what are you waiting for to go to bed, Estela? I was just waiting to say goodnight, Don Rodrigo. - Good night, Doña Gracia. - Good night. - Good night, Don Rodrigo. - Good night. - Good night, all. - Goodbye, Leopoldo. Excuse me, dad. - Good night, mommy. - Good night, son. - Good night, dad. - See you tomorrow. Maru, put those shoes on now! - Good night, daddy. - Good night. - See you tomorrow, dear. - Bye, child. - Good night, daddy. - See you tomorrow. And thank you, thank you for everything. You're welcome, daughter. What wouldn't parents do to please their children? Mommy, you're so sweet. Thank you, too. My darling child! My girl! It seems like yesterday and now you're a woman. All the better, mommy, now we can be friends. Friends? Where did you get such an idea? She is your mother. You owe parents love, loyalty, respect and obedience. After God, come your parents. - OK, off to rest. - Yes, daddy. Your daughter is a woman. She'll be a good mother. Were you happy? Yes, very. Weren't you glad to turn 15? Yes, but... - But what? - My party wasn't as nice as yours. My party? How funny... I'm happy to be 15... ...but about my party... ...I'm not sure. You say it was really nice. Very nice. - Can I have tea, mommy? - Children don't drink tea. - Why don't they? - I don't know, child. - Because it's bitter. - You should go to bed. Mom, mom... mommy. Children can eat cookies, right? Take one for you and one for your brother and go to bed at once. Yes, mom. Now we can have a cup of tea, Ricardo. Maru baked the cookies, she worked all afternoon. I hope you like them. Mom, please. Do you take milk or lemon? No milk. - Sugar? - Two, please. Thank you. Thank you. How do you want yours, son? - I'm talking to you. - Hector! What? What is it? Your mother is talking to you. Don't answer like that. I'm sorry, dad. I was distracted. Yes, mother? I asked you about your tea. Thank you, I won't have tea. Excuse me, I'm going out for a moment. I'll be right back. Where are you going? To make a phone call. Well, don't be long. We have company. No, I'm just going to the store. Will you excuse me? - Yes, man, of course. - Thank you, I won't be long. - Hector... - Yes, mom. Where are you going? You seem worried. It's nothing, mom. I'm just going to make a call. I won't be long. It's a matter of days. I'll be back in a couple of weeks. Child, tell your cousin we hope he comes back soon. But he just said he'll be back in two weeks, dad. And what about the thread factory situation? Do you think it will affect cotton growers? That depends. If we can export, I don't think we have a problem. But if the price goes down, we will be in trouble. My goodness! Do you think that might happen? Frankly, it's not so easy to say. It would take an in-depth study. Take Europe, for example, we can't count on them, that's obvious. They can get supplies from Northern Africa. The US is out of the question. They have their raw material problem... ...solved with synthetic fibers. So all we can do is wait and see. The doorbell. - Let Guadalupe go. - No, daddy, I'm already up. Hello, Maru. Thanks. Estela, your cousin Ricardo is here. I'll be right down, mommy. - With pleasure, uncle. - Just a sentence. It's always good to hear from family. Bring your cousin his hat. And let us know when you're coming so we can organize something. Don't bother, aunt, but I will. Thanks. Won't you wait for Estela? She shouldn't be long. I'm sorry, aunt, but I still have to go get my luggage. I only have 20 minutes. Goodbye, uncle. - Have a good trip. - A pleasure, aunt. - Maru, I'll be seeing you. - Goodbye, have a good trip. Thanks. I'll set the table. - Maria del Refugio! - Yes, daddy? I'm very displeased with you... After all my efforts to educate you properly! Why, daddy? What did I do? - Is that how you treat visitors? - What did I do? You didn't seem pleased that your cousin was here. The faces you made, the man must've thought he bored you. But, daddy, he only talked about things I don't understand. Doesn't matter. It is your duty to listen... ...and seem interested, that's just good manners. Yes, but it's good manners to talk about interesting things. Are you arguing with me? With who else, dad? I think that... Your duty is to obey, not to argue. And why were you so late? It's just that... You won't believe... There's no excuse. You know your duty... ...to come straight home from work. You have no other business. Yes, daddy. - Shall we go to the table? - Let's go. I imagine this will not happen again. - No, daddy. - OK, let's go to the table. - I'm going to wash my hands. - OK, don't be long. No, daddy. For our daily bread we thank you Lord. - Amen. - Amen. What's the matter with Hector? I don't know... I'm worried. I'm sure it's nothing. He probably has a deficit and the books didn't balance. No, it's not that. He wouldn't be so worried. So, you think balancing the books isn't important? Yes, Rodrigo, but not so as to make him so distracted. Then I see you have not understood the value... ...of accounting in business, in life itself. Yes, Rodrigo, but you didn't see how worried he looked. Of course, because he has been educated to be aware of his obligations. That's why he worries. Is that how we sit at the table? Amen. Can't you see? Accounting is the circulatory system of business... ...the heart which tells us its state. The government itself could not survive without accounting. In this house, do you know how much you spend? What you need? On a lesser scale, it's true... ...but accounting is always the same. It must be applied in absolutely everything... ...and there is always the debit and the asset... Are you going to have beans? - How are they prepared? - Same as usual. - Are they refried? - If you want, I can fry some. Please. - And you, Mister Hector? - What? How do you want your beans? No, I heard you but I don't want beans. Thanks Guadalupe. What's the matter, Hector? Your mother says you seem worried. Did the books not balance? What? The balance... yes, the balance. I have a difference, dad. But how big is the difference, son? - I've never seen you like this. - Wait... Tell me, Hector, is it in the books or in cash? In the books, dad, of course! OK, don't be alarmed. Look in expenses, it must be there. I'll do that first thing in the morning. And you, girls, to bed as soon as you are done. Yes, daddy. You'll see how fun it'll be. First we use this special tube for furniture... We take out the wires... ...we plug it in and we're ready to start. You won't recognize this place. This armchair will be like new... ...and after we shampoo it... ...there is no nook or cranny where Bright O'Home won't reach. Just look! Now we must clean the sofa and the other chair... ...and thus you can appreciate the... Angel! What did you do? Let me see... Wait! How did you get your finger in there? My God, Guadalupe... Hurry! - Guadalupe! - Coming! Coming! My Lord! What's the matter? Quick! What can we do? His finger is stuck. We coat it in soap. Shouldn't we call the machine man? He should know. His number is here... - Run and tell him to come at once! - I'm going, child! - The doorbell is ringing! Quick Guadalupe! - I'm coming! Good morning, I... Come in, come in, the Miss is in here... This way. He's here now. Finally! I'm so glad you came. I'm going crazy! His finger is stuck! I don't know who invented these devil's machines! Take your finger out. When it's on, it creates suction... It's nothing serious. He's happy now. Oh, my God! I'm such a fool. To think I bothered you... ...but this little brat! Wait a minute, it's not his fault. I think you'd better take this machine away, it's devilish! I always said so. There there, it's all over now. But dear Lord, I'm so embarrassed... Bothering you with all this nonsense. What will you think of me? Don't worry. It's natural that you were frightened. Yes, but sending for you and all... Well, aren't you going to take the machine away? Please, Guadalupe, don't mortify me anymore... Excuse me Miss, but the lady is right... These machines are very dangerous. Right? I always said so. The thing is... what is your name? Guadalupe Ramos surname Ortigas, at your service. Thank you, Miss. Roberto del Hierro, at yours. The thing is, Guadalupe... ...I bet you haven't had the machine blessed, right? No, you may be right. Angel, there you go again! Let him be. It's no problem. It's all a matter of being careful and the machines are very useful. In no time you will like them. The machine works fine and makes the furniture look great... ...maybe the problem is that we didn't take it to be blessed. Please take this child away, he's making me nervous. Angelito, let's go to the kitchen. I'll give you some chocolate... Excuse us, Mr. del Hierro. Go right ahead. Well, I guess I shall be leaving. I'm so embarrassed, Mr. del Hierro... I didn't even greet you... ...and now we have to say goodbye. But I was crazy... ...just thinking my mother would tell my father... ...It'd be the death of me. But why? You are not to blame. - If you explained... - Explain? I don't think he would say anything... You have no idea. My father is very energetic and severe... But your mother could tell him... My father is the boss. The father is always the boss everywhere, right? Of course, but there are other ways to reach an understanding... Your situation is different... But, doesn't your mother scold you? My mother? Of course not! She did when I was little, but now we are great friends. She tells me her things and I tell her mine. No. Well, she keeps some things to herself and so do I... Have a candy. Thank you. But she minds her own business and I do the same... ...she does as she likes and so do I. How is that? It's simple... If I don't do anything wrong, she's happy. And what can I say about her... How nice! You see how unhappy I am? You are the only friend I have... ...and I couldn't invite you to my birthday party. I wish you could come visit, and I don't dare tell my father. That's easy. One day I'll just show up... No. Don't even think about it. But I'm the one who'd come... Doesn't matter, my father would get furious and hit me. What? Hit you? Why not? It's his right, isn't it? He's my father. But... ...then what are you going to do? What's in store for you? - It's 12! Leave, quickly. - What's the matter? My mother! She'll be here any minute. Please. Calm down. What can she do? We're not doing anything wrong. I know, but I beg you... Please go. You have to work up your courage. Please. I beg you. Do it for me! For your mother! Alright, don't worry. But when can I see you? - Even if it's on the street? - Wherever. But when? - Whenever, but go now, please. - Tonight at eight. No, at seven. Outside the gate. I'll go out to buy bread. - And what can we do? Goodbye Ma'am. - Goodbye, Doña Gracia. - Mom, what did you bring me? - Careful, son. Mommy. Guadalupe, mom is home! I'm a mess. Did anyone come? No one, mommy. Let me help you. Can I help you, ma'am? Thank you, child. Thank you. Angel got his finger caught but it wasn't serious. I told him it was a dragon. That child! Come on, son... ...I'm going to lie down a bit because I'm exhausted. Come here, my love. God forgive me, Guadalupe. I had to tell a lie. Well, girl, if I am to be beaten for telling the truth... ...that's what white lies are for. - Just around the block. - No, I was scolded the other night. But, darling... - Estela... - No, please, no more. Tomorrow... - Mr. del Hierro. - How are you? Fine, thanks. Please come with me. What's the matter? Why are you so upset? Let's go, please. It's better. But don't be afraid. Calm down. I have to buy the bread. Just a moment. Wait a bit... Relax. You can't go through life like that. You see? Now let's go get the bread. Don't you ever get upset? Of course I do, when there's a reason. I'm always rushing and always in a tizzy... ...as if something were to happen. I don't understand that at your age. But... ...I am a woman already. Of course, but not old enough to be alarmed... ...as if you were pursued by a long history. I'm sorry, but you'll have to wait here. I'll be right back, OK? The lady at the store is such a gossip. Fine, I'll wait here. There... was I long? What's the matter? Why so pensive? I just don't know what to do about something. No, please. They're counted. I'm sorry. You understand, don't you? No problem. I just saw the bun and had a yearn for it. What were you telling me? Right, I've been offered a job... ...as head of sales for some new refrigerators... ...they're good, but I've been with Bright O'Home for six years... ...and they've been very kind to me. What do you think? Well, I really... The models are nice and easy to buy... ...they would sell like hotcakes. There are five models, but... I'm not sure what to do. What about your mother? What did she say? I talked to her, but that's the other thing... ...my mother is very sentimental; she's said... "You've been with Home a long time, they're so good to you..." But one has to think of oneself, don't you think? Besides... I could sell a refrigerator... ...to each of the homes where I sold a sweeper. That's for sure. Plus the 3% of my agents' sales... ...I could buy a house in two years. Right? What do you think? You haven't said anything. But, you know... Maybe I'm getting my hopes up and I want to get this straight... What's the matter? Let me go, I beg you. Alright, but what's the matter? - It's just that... - What? God knows I would like to tell you something... ...but I'm such a fool. No, but you... Let me go, I beg you. Please. May I see you tomorrow? - Good night. - Good night, daddy. Good night. Good night, daddy. Estela... - Are you asleep? - What? What did you want to tell me? Not tell you, ask you. What then? But you have to tell me the truth. So tell me, already. What do you talk about with Leopoldo? What? What do you talk about with Leopoldo? I mean... ...what does one talk about with a boyfriend? Why do you ask me that? - If I tell you, will you keep quiet? - Of course. - Swear you won't tell anyone. - I swear. I saw Roberto on the street today. Who? Roberto del Hierro. That decent boy with the machines. Oh yeah, so? I said I'd meet him tomorrow... ...that's why I asked about your conversations with Leopoldo. Just... ...stuff. Yes, but what stuff? Our stuff. Does he tell you about his work? His mother? Does he ask for your advice? What nonsense. Stop thinking so much and go to sleep. You like him, right? Well, let God's will be done. You can't go through life like that... - That's enough. - It's my duty. I also feel the urge to live in the countryside... ...it's the only part of the country... ...where good conduct is observed. - Thanks, Guadalupe. - You're welcome, ma'am. You're so right. Maybe because places are too small... ...for people to hide what they do. Although, there are some outsiders who come along with strange ideas. Let go of my bread! Why don't you ask? Lupe! Are those good table manners when we have company? - But twice now Angel has... - Stop it! Yes, dad. Have you found yourself a provincial woman yet? No, uncle. Don't you plan to marry? Frankly, I do, uncle. And I would like it to be soon. Days are long and boring at the ranch. Two make life more bearable. Don't you think so, Maru? Maria del Refugio! Yes, daddy? Your cousin is talking to you. I'm sorry, daddy. I was distracted. Forgive me, Ricardo. Did you want the salt? The salt... Your cousin was saying things that should interest you. Never mind, uncle. Maru was distracted. That's the problem. What's the excuse? Faithful observance of good manners makes for moral people. Yes, daddy. Your cousin and I were discussing the provinces. Yes, daddy. Maybe next year we can spend a few days there. - Are you finished? - Yes, you may take it. Make it soon, uncle. I will do all I can to make Maru happy. But young man, you haven't even tasted it. Yes, I did. Didn't you like it? It's not that, mommy, I don't know... I don't want soup. Take it away. I don't want my soup either! You have to finish it, dear, or you'll dream about the dragon. With a tail? Yes, son, a dragon with a tail. When Maru gets married can I carry the tail? Yes, son. You can carry her train. You heard your mother. But maybe Estela will marry first. But I'm going to carry Estela's train. Right, Estela? That was the deal. No rice, thank you. Aren't you going to have rice either? No, I'm not hungry. What's the matter? What is it? I don't know... I don't feel well. I haven't for several days. With your permission, dad. I'll go to my room. I'm not OK. Alright, son. You are excused. Get some rest. - Excuse me, mom. - Yes, son. - Excuse me. - Go ahead, Hector. Rodrigo, I'm worried about him... ...and I don't think it's a matter of numbers. I'll go talk to him. - I'll be right down. Excuse me. - Yes, uncle. I came to see what's wrong, because we are starting to worry. What is it? What's the matter? Well... there are some things, but nothing important. You can talk honestly to me, I'm your father. Is there a difference in the books? No, father. It's not about numbers, or cash... Just unpleasantness... Listen... ...you'd better tell me now before there are consequences. Do you need to see a doctor? No, father. It's not that. Don't worry, it's just personal things. I understand, son, and I don't see why you don't talk to me... If you like, you can come in later sometimes. At your age, parents should be more tolerant... ...don't you think? Yes, father. You see? Now it's all cleared up. I'll go reassure your mother. Darn, I only have 10 minutes to get to the office. Don't worry anymore. Thank you, father. - Mom... Mom... - Yes. When Maru goes to my uncle Ricardo's ranch... ...can I come too? Of course, child. I have four pigs I'm sending to the fair. You don't say. I think we should be leaving. Girls, walk your cousin to the door, I have to talk to your mother. Go get your cousin's hat. Well, aunt, see you later. Come back soon. And your lunch? It's time. But don't worry, I'll grab a bite later. I spoke with Hector. Nothing to worry about. - Nothing's wrong? - No. He explained it all and I told him what to do. Praise the Lord. - OK, see you later. - Goodbye, Rodrigo. - Maru, how are you? - Fine, thank you. Was I late? No, I just got here. - Let's walk. - OK. Have you decided about the refrigerators? Not yet. I'm waiting to see if they better the offer, see? What do you think? - Roberto, may I tell you something? - Of course. Do you promise not to laugh at me? Why should I laugh? Please don't laugh. But see... ...last night I couldn't sleep thinking of what to say about the refrigerators. You don't say. But now you confuse me by asking something else. You're so cute. You see? You're laughing at me. Don't be upset, I'm laughing with pleasure not at you. Pleasure? I'm so silly, I couldn't answer your question. It doesn't matter. And without meaning to, you've helped me. No... But how? Because by listening to me and not reaching a conclusion... ...you made me think. And I didn't sleep all night... - My mother is the same way. - And you? I slept fine. What nerve! Why? That's the thing. The man does the work. He has to be rested. The woman has to worry and think things over. What? Do you mean she is the one who has to think? After all, he has to bring the money home. So she should take an equal interest in things, right? Will you excuse me? I'll buy the bread. Then you can tell me more, OK? Go, I'll wait here. Another one... No, that's enough. - Another one, please. - I said no. See you tomorrow. - All done? - All done. But tell me, why did you say the woman should think? Well, not always, with something important that would affect... ...the home, I think both should wrack their brains. Go on. What else? That's what I think. Right... but why do you think it should be like that? Holly! Now you have me thinking. Well, from what I've seen and would like... Mostly because I'd like that. Let's say a couple, a man and a woman, for example... If he tells his things to her and she makes them her own... ...over time he will trust her more... ...feel united Yes, of course, but what about her? Who does she talk to? It's the same thing, she tells him her problems... ...and he should help her solve them... ...and he does like her: with affection. Because there's a kind of thankfulness between them. - Don't you think? - Of course. And in time, her living his problems... ...and him living hers... ...well she lives through him and him through her. How lovely! And another thing I've seen is... ...she takes pride in his things... ...she's right, they are like hers, with her taking part... And it's the same with him, because the greatest pride for a man... ...what really gives him strength... ...is to find his partner and be able to count on her. My goodness! I must go. Bye. But wait, Maru. Won't you say goodbye? I'm sorry... forgive me. Oh, if only you knew... Can I see you tomorrow? Yes? Whenever you want, Roberto. Always. All that sacrifice to see my son a slave to his instincts! We had been drinking, dad, I didn't know what I was doing... ...she herself said we should go to the cabin. And you kept quiet since the picnic? Do her parents know? They do. She's waiting outside and she will need attention soon. But, do you love her, son? Even if he didn't! He must be responsible for his actions... ...after all the sacrifices I've made to educate him! You bear my name and I don't want it said that my son doesn't mend his mistakes. Yes dad. I too am aware of my responsibility in this. As of tomorrow, there's one more mouth in this house. Go tell your siblings to wash their hands your father is almost here. Yes, mommy. Hector, mom says to wash your hands now, dad is almost here. - Did you buy the bread? - Yes, hours ago. Didn't you hear me? As soon as I finish the exercise! When mom orders something, you must obey. Go upstairs... Now! - Are you deaf? - Give it back! - I'll give it back later. - Give it to me! Instead of helping your wife, you just lie around. Give it to me! Here and come down soon. Estela? - What's the matter? - Where's that girl? She just went up to her room. Estela! Estela! Where are you? I'm sorry, father... Forgive me, father... I hope this teaches you a lesson... I won't speak to you or give you my blessing for a month. Leopoldo will not set foot in this house again. I caught them smooching on the street! Come serve me dinner. Go see your sister. Yes, mommy. Oh, sister... Wait a minute, I'll go get you something. There, there... You'll see, dad will repent. It's only a matter of days. Estela! - Mommy! - What is it, daughter? - Estela. - What is it? What is this racket? - Estela, dad. She's gone. - What do you mean gone? Where could she be? Estela! Where is Miss Estela? I don't know. I was cooking... Alright, she has left... ...and it's for the best, after what she did she is dead to this home. I hope this is an example to you... God knows what's in store for her for disobeying her parents... ...and seeing her boyfriend. And then there's your brother. A wretch and a failure. He can't even support his wife. If he had only followed the example of his parents... And listen to me... You ought to cultivate relations with your cousin Ricardo. He is a serious man who respects this house. Which ensures he will provide a similar one for you. Agreed? Young man, listen. Come here. How are you Guadalupe? - What can I do for you? - I brought you this from Miss Maru. But I can't read this here. When you get this, I want you to know I won't be able to see you anymore. Forgive me, but I don't think I can make you happy as I know you deserve... ...and I wish for you with all my heart. Goodbye and please don't try to see me, farewell, Maru. I don't know what she said, but I can imagine since she was crying... ...and she might as well, after everything that has happened... I don't understand. Mister Roberto, you should help her because it isn't fair... not fair. Tell me, Guadalupe, what happened? What is this all about? There isn't much to tell. Nothing. Don Rodrigo wants to marry Maru... ...to that puppet, her cousin Ricardo. Since he has money. Really? Poor thing, and he has her so scared. Do you want me to help the young lady? If I were in your place... ...I wouldn't let them take her away from me. So, will you help me? I'll do whatever you say... OK, come on... Yes, of course. Coming, child. What's with you? Why so anxious? You'd think you were expecting a letter. Only from Ricardo. Impossible! Ricardo is arriving today and coming to dinner with us. Give this to your sister. Mommy, I want lots of marrow. There's no marrow today, son. Lots of marrow. There is the refrigerator. What? Guadalupe! Guadalupe! Did you call me? What did you say? I said that there's the refrigerator or whatever you call it. What refrigerator? They brought it and I told them to put it there. What do you mean? - Or wherever you want. - Nowhere. Come on. How strange. I don't understand this. What kind of joke this is. That's all I need... ...a refrigerator. Guadalupe! - Yes, sir? - What's this doing here? - Didn't I tell you that they brought it? - But who sent it? The men said Mr. del Hierro, the one who sold you the sweeper. The nerve! - Look! - Leave that alone! And why did you let them leave it there? They said it was for you, here is the invoice. It clearly says Mr. Rodrigo Cataño. - I thought you ordered it. - Ordered it. Maybe they left it on trial. The men said Mr. del Hierro would come at 9 to talk to you. Talk to me? It seems a mockery. Alright, I'll talk to him at 9. Meanwhile, no one move or touch this machine. Let's all go to the table. Angel is becoming a brat and is showing his temper. More coffee? You were saying? Come, child, sit here because I can't see you or hear you. Yes, aunt. I don't know why they sent this machine. It's Guadalupe's fault for having it put here. - Would you like more coffee? - No, thanks, aunt. That must be the darned agent. Coming, coming. - Guadalupe will get it. - Please, aunt. Good evening. Mr. Cataño? He's expecting you and Ricardo is here also. Is he? Great. May I speak to him? Come in. He's in the living room. Thank you. Don Rodrigo, here is the refrigerator man. - Good evening, Mr. Cataño. - Evening. Good evening, ma'am. Miss, at your feet. Nice to meet you, sir. My goodness! How silly of them to leave it here. I hope it hasn't been a problem. Tomorrow, I'll... Young man, cut the preliminaries... ...on whose authority... ...did you take the liberty of sending this to my home? - Let me explain. - That is what I'm waiting for. And I trust you will be brief and remove it at once. Of course, Mr. Cataño. Now allow me to tell you that.. ...I sent it because you are on the company records... ...as a solvent man who fulfills his commitments. The company believes... ...our prestigious customers should be... ...the first to choose new merchandise that comes in. Of course, but I think you should consult me first. You are so right, Mr. Cataño. My excuse is that my zeal... ...led me to send it to you rather than have you go to the store. With this new import law, it will be almost impossible to get a refrigerator. As you well know sir. Yes, it has also been bad for us. The laws they're making these days... These machines are from a prior shipment... ...I had my agents set this one aside... ...to come to consult you personally as sales manager. But leaving it here! I understand your annoyance. Still I would like to show you the advantages of this refrigerator. Ma'am, would you? God! The trays are out of place! The children got into it. No problem, these machines are so solid and simple... ...they're easy to handle and long lasting. For you, too, sir. Are you married? No, single. If you are planning to marry, now's the time to decide. It would be hard to find a better gift for your missus... ...and since you are a friend of Mr. Cataño... A relative, my nephew. All the better, I can have one set aside and offer you... ...the same terms as Mr. Cataño. But you must decide now. Do you like it, Maru? What do you say, Miss? It's the most useful device for the home, it keeps food fresh... ...and makes wonderful jelly. What do you say, Maru? Maru, your cousin is asking if you'd like a refrigerator. I love it, dad. It is lovely, Ricardo. No need to explain. I'll buy one. Great. Thank you Miss. You have great taste. Besides, each one has a manual. Goodness, my nephew has put me in a bind... I see I'll have to keep this one. Wonderful, Mr. Cataño. I know you and your family will be satisfied. Excuse me, but you haven't said the price. $2,365.49, Mister Cataño. You set the terms. Your solvency is well known. It will pay for itself, you only shop once a week and that way... Yes, it will be much cheaper. It will pay for itself in no time. - Would you sign here? - With pleasure. - Here you are. - Thank you, Mr. Cataño. If you would be so kind. It'll really be restful to only go to market once. It is a great comfort, no doubt. Thank you very much, Mr. Cataño. Allow me to congratulate you and wish you happiness. Thank you. I'm so glad you brought the refrigerator. - Here you are, Mr. del Hierro. - Thank you, Mr. Cataño. - Good night, ma'am. - It was a pleasure. Good night, Miss. I hope you are very happy. Tomorrow I'll send the boys over to move it to the kitchen. - Excuse me. - I'll walk you to the door. Don't bother. Thank you. - Thank you, Mr. Cataño. - You're welcome, Mr. del Hierro. - Good night. - Good night. - Maru! - What now? What's the matter? I can't, father. I can't. What's the matter? What is it? I don't love him, father. I don't love him! And if you think I'm going to marry you for a refrigerator you're wrong! Maru! You have said enough. Go to your room and I shall not speak to you... ...until you reconsider. I beg you to be benevolent and understanding with my daughter. She's still a child. I understand that, uncle. May I leave now? Of course, I understand you would want to. Good night, aunt. Good night. Aren't you going to go for the bread, child? It's seven. Mister Roberto is waiting outside. Gracia. I'm coming. You finish, I'll see what your father wants. You know? The neighbor asked me about Mister Roberto. He said he would wait until a quarter past. That if you didn't come out, he would leave. You know how exact he is about time. Well, it's up to you. But don't be crying later... I don't want to talk to her. Ask her when she's going for the bread. She's helping me set the table. Remember, it's written: "The doors of heaven never open wide... ...just a little bit every now and then for those who know how to slip in." It's up to you. I did my part. I just want to say that only jackasses and corpses... ...don't change their mind. When are you going for the bread? Have Guadalupe go. Hello, Roberto. What a surprise. I was passing by and I said to myself: Maybe Maru will go for the bread, so... I wasn't going to come, but my father asked me to. What a lucky break. But don't brush me off. Everything works out for you. You sold two refrigerators instead of one. I had to take care of business. Of course, it's all business for you. What do you care about other people? Did I steal their money? I was offering something useful. Something useful! You're all for practicality, right? Nobody else matters. Aren't they happy with the refrigerators? - That's not the point. - Then what? Well... People's feelings, I mean, considerations... Though now I see that means nothing to you. Why do you say that? It's clear. You left a house that was considerate of you... ...to go with the refrigerators, and why? All because you could sell them easily and make money. Never mind. I'll go get the bread. OK, I'll wait here. As you wish. I don't care. All done? I guess after all things don't work out for me. Why is that? You see... I took the refrigerator job because I had no one to consult... I thought a girl wanted to help me... ...but she sent me packing... and why? Because she had a rich suitor. Don't say that. Why not? You didn't have to think with him. Roberto, you are unfair. Am I? He gave you everything just saying: "Do you like it, Maru?" You're odious, Roberto. You know why I did it. Guadalupe must have told you and you make fun of me. I'm not making fun. Maybe I'm disappointed. Disappointed in me? Yes, I thought you were brave... ...that you could be my partner to fight together and make of our lives one life. Say no more, Roberto... Perhaps you are right, I am afraid. But you know how my father is. He always has his way. It's funny. You decided against him out of spite, the decision of a moment... Life is a series of little decisions. Why not make the one that'll be lifelong? You're making me feel even more unhappy. I don't feel any better, but I see you are the same little girl... ...who once didn't dare to give me a sweet bun. Take the bun and all the bread you want. Silly girl, I don't want the bun. When can I talk to your father? Let's go. Yes, let's. Hector, someone is at the door. I'm coming, dad. Good evening. Daddy... Mr. del Hierro wants to talk to you. Come in, Mr. del Hierro. Good evening, how are you? Don't get up. - Please be seated. - Thank you. What can I do for you? - I came to talk to you about... - Wait. Maru, you may leave. Wait, Maru. What? What I came to talk to you about concerns Maru. What is it? Maru and I have had a relationship for some time now... What? Of course thinking of a proper marriage. And you come tell me so boldly! Forgive me, Mr. Cataño, We should... Some time ago... Behind my back! On the street, I imagine? Now I understand your attitude the other night. What mockery! Excuse me, I came to ask for Maru's hand. What is it, son? It turns out the refrigerator salesman is Maru's boyfriend. What? - It seems he came for her. - My Lord above! And he's going to take her. Yes, he is shameless. Look who's talking. I beg you to be reasonable, Mr. Cataño. If we... Reasonable! That's all I need... ...for you to come to my house and pass judgment. You're a cynic! Leave at once and don't ever come back. I understand, Mr. Cataño, but I want to warn you... First I sold you a sweeper and it was useful so you kept it. Then I sold you a refrigerator. This matter is much more important in my life. So I shall come for Maru even if I have to wait outside to take her to church. - Good night. - Get out! He is shameless! What nerve! My goodness, I don't know what's right anymore. What? Can't you see? That cynic has no respect! Not even for elders. He has shamelessly paraded you daughter on the streets. And this hussy, behind my back... ...doing God knows what indecencies! That isn't true, mom! He's always been decent and refined. Of course, what else could you say? What you hear... always... Don't talk back to me! You should be ashamed of yourself. Ashamed of what? God is my witness I've done nothing wrong. On the contrary, the measly time of our meetings... ...we used it to make plans for a life of understanding. - A life of understanding... - Yes! Of me taking part in his problems and triumphs and easing his sorrows... ...while he is my support and guide. Me living in him as he lives in me. That is what gives me courage to speak out now. I won't live in the same loneliness as my mother. Tell him, mom. You tell him. Tell him what you feel! Daughter, I am so unhappy! What did you say? Have I not given you a name and a respectable home...? Is it my fault your children have forgotten what is right? What is pure and what I have taught them? Is it my fault? Forgive me, Rodrigo. I don't know what I am saying. I don't know who put ideas into your head. But whoever judges his parents is blaspheming. I express my desires... My hopes to make a home where my husband will find warmth and haven... ...and the children we have... You've talked of that, too? A young lady... Yes, so the kids I give him... ...don't see in their parents a forbidding hand... ...but rather a communion of hearts, not slaves to prejudice. I have had enough...! Rodrigo! I don't know what stops me from crushing such ingratitude. Hit me! Hit me as much as you like, I won't be like Estela. I'll wait for him to come for me and he shall come... ...and I will leave here if I have to wait Make it soon, before I lose control... But you will leave here alone, none of your family is with you... Do you hear? No one. Maru. Can I cut this sprig? As a souvenir. Of course, go ahead. Mommy! Don't hug me, child. We would cry and you mustn't cry and spoil your face. You see? You must not cry, not until later, alone... You must appear strong... ...because the hopes of many girls are riding on you. Gracia. - Where are you? - In the bathroom. I'm coming. Go in peace. I know you will be happy. You have my blessing. Pilar. Yes? Did you take the sprig yet? - No. - Cut it. Guadalupe, am I ready? Daddy, I'm leaving. Maru... ...we're waiting for you. You're a lovely bride. Congratulate your groom for me. - Do you have a cigarette? - You've smoked a lot, Roberto. I'm more nervous than when I sold the first machine. Go on. They are waiting for you. Congratulations, daughter, you are very brave... ...just as Roberto described you. Shall we go? Let's go. - Well, where's my cigarette? - Later. Let's go! - Maru! - Angel! Can we carry your train? Come on, just to the gate. OK, that's far enough. Goodbye, Lupita. Don't cry, silly. Can't you see how happy I am? Go on smile... like that. Let's go, please. Maru. Goodbye, Maru, be very happy. - What are we waiting for? Let's go. - Wait, you can't go there. Why? The bride rides with me to the church. You ride with the godfather. Some godfather! You know what he gave us? An M10. - OK, let's go. - Go on, get into that car. They are all machine salesman. Go on, friend. No, you drive. I'm too nervous. When I get married I will wear white like Maru... ...you will carry my train. To the church? - To the church. - Lupe and Angel! Come home. Yes, daddy. Mommy, Maru has left, too. I believe these children were forbidden to go out. From now on, nothing will be forbidden to them. Don't cry, Lupita. Don't be sad. Maru will be very happy, I promise you. Your father wants you to go on playing. Gracia. This seems like encouraging indiscipline to me. No, Rodrigo, it is allowing them some pleasure... ...letting them be themselves. Why make them bend to your will all the time? I think we should rather give in to reason. - I believe they are my children. - Yes, Rodrigo. But their lives do not belong to you... they are theirs to live. Now I see it clearly... We have only been blind instruments to give them life. But we have no right to enslave it. I trust that God has enlightened me to guide my children by reason alone. Children don't understand reason. No, Rodrigo. We are the ones who don't understand the reasoning of children. The respect and obedience that you've always demanded... ...isn't something for them to give us, it's something we have to earn. Take Maru. What memories does she take of her home? Her happiness lies with the man who took her... ...not with what her parents could've given her. She owes us nothing. What shall you give to the ones left? Shall they have the same bitter memories as the others? Think about it, Rodrigo. Think about it. THE END Subtitles: Cineteca Nacional, Mexico
