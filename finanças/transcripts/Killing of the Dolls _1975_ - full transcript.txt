I'm sorry, Paul. Here's the park. I didn't know that. I'll take you further. Whatever you want. I already told you, I get very jealous... And you shouldn't look at people that way. Don't be stupid. Give me my glasses. Leave me alone. Hello son, how did the course go? They suspended me. Worthless. Be careful. See you tomorrow, John. Goodbye, John. - Goodbye, little devil. Marlo, don't be so cruel. Hey, youngster, where are you going? We're going for a little walk. I'm closing the park. I know how to get out. Give me the glasses, I can't see. What's wrong? You should've told me you were having your period. I'm sorry. "I'm sorry"... that's your excuse for everything. Now how will I clean myself? I'll do it. You'll do it? You don't have time, precious. Would you give me my glasses, please? Be careful. Don't step on them. Don't scream. I won't harm you. Don't move. You can remove the body. Go. Are you the grounds-keeper? Come here for a minute. Lift. Come on. What's happening? He feels faint... John, help me. Why did you bring him? You know he can't bear these things. Man! Leave him alone! Paul, son! - Leave him! I'm feel sad. I'm very sad. I'm tired of walking. My feet hurt. No, I don't like bike-rides. We could fall... No, don't squeeze me so hard. I found you. Now watch what I'm going to do. What happened? Who broke the window? Father, who was that child? It's Robert. A little devil. Walters grandson. And who's Walter? An old friend who spends his days in the park. You should watch the kid carefully... He's a potential killer. Bring some water. Do you want to burn down the park? Stop! Paul. Do you want me to get mad? Put these things away. Yes, mother. Whatever you say. Don't scream, mother. You look quite ugly... I must tell you something... The killer is on the loose. What are you saying? Nothing, just be careful. Maybe he's in here. And you don't know it. I have a special toy. Do you collect them? Yes, I collect things... Don't you collect things? Yes, I collect hearts. It's very entertaining. What kind of hearts? The kind that grown-ups carve on trees in the forest. That's extraordinary. I hadn't thought of that. A collection of hearts... My mother said it's stupid. She is stupid. Hey, what's your name? I'm Robert. Would you like to be my friend? If you're nice, of course. - I promise. Let me go. What are you doing? Are you mad? Do you want to kill him? What are you saying? Don't you see that we're playing? Isn't that right, Robert? Yes, we were playing. Leave, grandfather. What did you do with my matches? - I burned Margaret in the park. Leave! You know me? I'm Paul, the gardeners son. Oh... I thought your parents only had a girl. You're mistaken... I don't have a sister. And what do you do? Go to school? ...or work? School, I want to be a surgeon. That's interesting. I like ambitious boys... I need to talk to your parents. Is it urgent? They're involved in something disgusting... I don't know if they're finished yet, but I'll call for them. Father. The countess asks for you. Hello, Countess, What a surprising visit. How can I help you? It's not important. I just wanted to let you know... You can begin your vacation tomorrow. I already talked to the butler. He'll water the plants. It's not necessary. Paul will do it for us. We were just talking. I thought you had a little girl. Unfortunately no. We do have a little son, even though he's already twenty. He'll be a fine surgeon one day. That would've been nice. But he's been expelled. And he's not allowed to repeat the course. That's why he's not going on holiday with us. It's not as serious as it looks. There were worse students than me... But a teacher kept hounding me. And he wasn't happy until I was suspended. That's not true, Paul. It's not your teacher's fault that you have a fear of blood. Are you leaving tonight instead of tomorrow? And you? Still studying? No, I'm writing a novel. I'm using my imagination. Don't worry, father. I'll take care of the garden. I'll watch it... Listen to this: "The beaches are over..." "And the arms are burnt by the sun." "They came back from vacation ...the house smelled humid..." "They opened the windows... They didn't know each other..." "Even though they had 22 years of marriage..." "They went back to the grave... to get rid of the luggage..." "Those mysterious objects of travellers..." "How many secrets can a bag carry?..." "while taking off the clothes, Ophelia screamed in horror..." "between her dirty clothes she found a man's chopped hand." Don't be so gruesome. The characters from my story have nothing to do with you... It's not that bad, mother. I caught these. They're a little broken, but you can have them... What are you studying? Something difficult. You wouldn't understand. Why? Do you also think I'm still a child? No. I know you're a young man with a beautiful girlfriend. I had a girlfriend. I don't see her anymore. She was stupid... After all, she was just a doll. Do you have a girlfriend? No, no girlfriend. I'm completely free. You've never carved a heart on a tree? No, never. Why? You're already grown up. Other grown-ups like you kiss girls and carve hearts... I've seen it in the park. Now that my parents are gone, I'm getting a girlfriend. Good. They left you alone. You can do whatever you want. Anything. Why don't you tell me what you're studying? I want to be a cardiovascular surgeon. What is a cardiovascular surgeon? He saves the lives of patients suffering from a heart condition. You like so many smart things... You see? You tear off heads like I do. What's this? - A stethoscope. What's it for? - To check the heartbeat. How does it work? - Get up here. What do you hear? You're worthless, not good for anything. Why are you wearing a mask? You look so ugly. Why's your hand shaking? Instead of becoming a surgeon, you'll be a butcher. What are you doing? Are you the gardener? Yes, how can I help you? I want you to sell me a rose from the bushes if possible. Wait for me. Don't leave... Let's go. This one, please. No. I don't sell flowers. It's a gift to the lady. He's an odd fellow. What are you laughing at? Look at them. May I come in? - This is your house. You're strange. Do you need anything? I think so. Lonely people sometimes need something... Why don't you turn on the light? Do you mind? I thought you like the dark. Only for certain things... I'm going to my room. I've got to change... I'm not wearing anything. Paul, would you mind sleeping at my house tonight? I've never slept anywhere else but in this house, but I'd like to... It'd be a new experience. Listen, Paul. Why does it smell like burnt meat? I've tried to cook my own meal for the first time. Is there a girl with you? I don't know. Perhaps Katherine came back. And who's Katherine? Nobody, it was nothing. Try not to make too much noise. Even though my husband's no here, it's better if no one sees you. Come on. My room is downstairs. Be aware, don't lock your door. Don't worry, I won't. No, I won't sleep with her. Open up. What's going on, René? The fuse blew, we had a power cut. I thought the lady could use a candelabra. I didn't notice. When did it happen? Just a few minutes ago. How did you know I'm here? I didn't. I wanted to leave the candelabra in your room. Thank you, René. But my room is downstairs. Who is this, Mother? The gardener's son. Do you want anything? No, nothing. You can leave then... And cut me some flowers. He's coming. It's about time. You overslept? I'm not used to open the gates to the park. You want me to help you watering the plants, don't you? Is that alight? Yes, but stay close. Let's go right away. What is this axe for? To cut wood. Why do you do strange things? You devil. Why did you kill the doll in the park? Because I don't like dolls. I don't like them either. Go to your grandfather. I'll see you later. Did you sleep well? And why did you lock the door to your room? You told me not to do it, that's why I did it. No offence. What's wrong? Why don't you understand me? What do I not understand? Why do you think I wanted you to sleep at my house? Very well. Don't say it. Do you think I'm stupid? Can't I just like you? Do I have to sleep with you? Of course not. Then leave me alone. Why are you doing this to me? Why? Don't be childish. Why don't you like the countess? Leave me. You could kill her. Why are you waiting? I don't want to. No more blood. You might not want to... but I must use your hands again... Yes, Paul, I'm stronger than you. And I'm a part of you forever. If you kill me, we'll die together. That's the only way out! But you're a coward. Damn you. Haven't you ever been with a woman? Your silence means that you haven't. I've never kissed anybody. And I want a girl who hasn't either. You know the countess' daughter? Do you know her name? I fooled you. Grandfather, he wanted to kill me. - Look, this is a fake knife. I fooled him, look. I'm sorry for the child. Never mind. Mr. Bronson, do you know the countess' daughter? Yes, she's a very nice girl. I've never seen her here before. Who are you? I'm Audrey. My name is Robert. This is my friend Paul. Nice to meet you. Me too. Thank you for the beautiful flowers you gave to my mother. Then... this is true... What are you saying? This is boring. See you later, Paul. I didn't know you take care of the garden. I haven't seen you before. Of course not. It's the first time I do it. And I'm not very good at it. My parents left me alone. Do you mind if I join you? I need to talk to somebody. I get lonely in this house. Do you understand? There aren't many young people around here. Am I Right? Partially, but this is the first time I've been ever here. To see me? Or because you were bored? What do you think? I believe they're heading to paradise. Sit down here and I'll tell you about my collection. Or do you want something to drink? I'm sorry. I've never been in a situation like this. I don't know what to do. Whose dolls are these? Do you have a sister? Take that off, Paul. You made me get used to them. It's too late now. What do you mean? Maybe you haven't noticed. Of whom does this remind you? Remember me, Mother? I'm not Paul. I'm your daughter Katherine. Don't be so cruel. - Be careful. What's wrong? You should know better than anyone else. You made me believe I was your little Katherine. And you dressed my in her clothes... ...and you gave me her dolls. I don't remember that, Paul. You were very small. I remember everything, Mother. Sometimes father told you not to call me 'Katherine'. I'm so sorry, Paul. I didn't mean any harm... I just had trouble believing my little girl was dead. Don't delude yourself. You get what you wanted. I don't understand. You created a double personality inside of me. And now I've grown up... ...hating dolls and women. Your precious Katherine is a human beast. Whose dolls are these? Do you have a sister? I did. She died before I was born. But my parents, grieving their loss, made me play with the dolls. Why do you keep them? I don't know. Maybe I'm afraid to ask me that question. You've been messing around, huh? What are you doing here? How did you get in? Through the kitchen window. I thought you were experimenting. And I wanted to frighten you. You also like to experiment with things? No. Robert was talking about my surgeon studies... By the way, I'm going to the city to buy some equipment... Do you want to come with me? We can take my car. But you'll have to drive. Do you like mannequins? I love them... They look like you... It'd be wonderful to have a collection... Do you know where they make them? How much are they? - Prices vary. This one for example... £100 Thank you. I appreciate it. Let's go. I didn't know they were that expensive. Why don't you leave your studies? Isn't there anything else you like more? You, for example. You're strange. I'm walking home. Please take the car to the garage. See you tomorrow. - See you forever. "Good evening Mr. Doctor... have you seen Robert?..." "He left me alone. I'm very sad. I don't like to be lonely" What's wrong with you dolls? Are you jealous of Audrey, the doll from the park? Yes, you're jealous. I noticed it in the way you look. And I won't tolerate that. They're leaving. Well, let them. It's their loss. Kill. - Leave me alone. You must do it, Paul. A broken heart over the grey waves of the sky... She was staring at the black butterflies in the corner... She cried. The moon laughed at her tears. You wretched creature. You shouldn't have been born. Settle down. Stop it. - Silence. Can we see Inspector Boris? Juarez Park is well known by the children... Even though it closes early, there's an entrance in the back. We call it paradise. What happened in the garden? Everything was confusing... I remember there was a strange mask... But it could have been the effect of the drugs... When we woke up, the girls were missing... And the glass door of the garden was shattered. Very well. Leave, but don't leave the city. Show them to the door. - Let's go. What's wrong? They're afraid. It's the fourth killing in a month... The bodies were found not too far from Montpelier river. Someone threw them into the river and the flood took them away. They were cut open and the hearts ripped out. Tell me: How did you open the door? The door? It was open. Liar! I locked it before I left! What do you want in this house? I'm looking for the gardener. I want some more flowers. Tonight I'm having a party in the Golden Room... My husband returns tomorrow and... I'm celebrating the end my my summer. I'm sorry, Ma'am. If I were in your place, I'd take things a lot easier. You're too serious about everything. The party starts at ten. And you're invited. See? I don't hold grudges. And don't leave the door open next time. I detest misunderstandings. What are you doing in my room? I'm sorry. What are you looking for? Didn't you give me the keys so I could come anytime? But not in my room. I came in here so my mother wouldn't see me. If you heard what we talked about, then... ...you should know there's no problem... ...or reason to hide. I'm sick of her following and insulting me for not accepting her as my lover. You should talk to her about us. Audrey, be naked. Strip. Turn around. Thank you, Audrey, thank you. It's the first time someone cried for me. Did you notice? I got rid of the dolls. I'm not alone. I love you. Do you like it, Mother? - No, you're much prettier. But there's a strange resemblance. Take it to my room. Help me. Is she really a countess? Why don't you let her see you? I never thought you had such a grown-up daughter. You think I'm that young? Are you going to come? The guests are still arriving. But don't worry. I'll see you later tonight. I'm going to show you something you'll like very much. Something I am collecting and it affects both of us. Can you tell me what it is? No, you must come to see it. I also have a surprise. Can you tell me? No, surprise for a surprise. You know something? - What? I love you. No, I love you. Then we love each other. All right. Don't take long. I'll be waiting. The rest isn't important, but... Why would a beauty like you marry Geraldo? No comment, no? I'm going to get a drink. Who's there? Did I scare you? I ran out of patience. Marvellous. It's marvellous! What a party. No one's missing, but where's your daughter? She must have gone to her room, but I am here. My daughter. - Tony, darling... Do you want to dance? No, I'm tired. Is anything wrong, Paul? No, nothing. Remember my little friend Robert? He's still missing. Do you want to help me? - What? Do you want to see an open heart operation? - I don't know if I can stand it. Was that the surprise you had for me? No, it's not that. But after your gift, mine isn't important. To tell the truth, it's not finished yet. Prepare the instruments, everything is in the cabinet. I want to show you how unjustly they suspended me at college. What are you going to do? This mannequin is a woman who needs an operation. Help me undress her. Would you? I'm starting to like this game. Listen, why don't we leave? I'm going to cut you, but you know I love you. Instead of being a surgeon, you'll become a butcher. I don't permit comments. There's no anaesthesia, Paul. I'm sorry. We'll have to tie you. No, Paul. Don't do it. I thought it was a joke, but please don't ruin that mannequin. Put that doll on the table. No, Paul. Do not insist. What the hell are you doing? Look Audrey. This is the most important operation of my life. If you're afraid of blood now... ...what will happen when you must perform a real operation? Come close, Audrey, look. No, you're insane. I'm going to use the instrument we bought together. Paul, open. Audrey, it's your mother... I'll take her away from here. Wait. Don't leave. What do you want? The lady is satisfied with your services? No! I'm not. I was waiting for you. But you didn't come. Who are you afraid of? Your father or my husband? I'm afraid of the night. ...And you. Really. You offend me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I want you to be like this all the time. That's strange. Where was he hidden? She wants everything for herself. Don't make so much noise. So, how was the party? It doesn't matter... because our party starts now. René, serve champagne to him. And I'm going to change... I'll be back. You can leave. You can stay if you like. I prefer to leave, Ma'am. No kissing. - Don't be afraid. What are you doing? René, you're so handy. It's about time... after serving all these years. The master has arrived. Very well. Is everything prepared? Everything, Ma'am. Let's go. Where's the gardener? I'm sorry, Sir. He must be sleeping. Idiot. What are you doing here? How dare you enter my daughter's room? I don't remember anything. Is Audrey back? Back? From where? Only three roses for the master's bedroom. Who are you? - I'm Paul... ...the gardener's son. I want to meet him. Sir, you must know that he is your daughter's boyfriend and your wife's lover. That's bad news. It can't be possible. Paul, it's your best collection. But you needed Audrey's heart... Accept me for as long as you live. The lady still has her hysterical problems. Don't you think it's beautiful, Paul? Audrey is dead because of Katherine, mother... ...The beast that you've created.
