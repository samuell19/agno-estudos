Very good girls! It hurts a little, but the result is worth it! Let's! We move booty! Angel! Angel, pick up the phone! I am always thinking about you! I don't want to be with him anymore! Angel! Angel, pick up the phone! I am always thinking about you! I don't want to be with him anymore! JALISCO SCHOOL Good morning. Almost everyone is here. I don't see... Salles Ruby? David Carlos? He has a hangover. Yvette Placencia? She came to the first lesson. I saw her, she was talking on the phone. Renteria Gustavo didn't come? He's out there on the street. OK... Write down the task. Now for nothing! Then go to hell! - No no. - Fuck it! Where are you going? May I enter? What's happened? Continue writing down the task. So how? Everything will stay the same, right? Shut up! Okay, I'll shut up. Who did it? I ask who did it? Throw like you should. Well, how? Did I throw well? Come out. What? Come out! No! Teacher! Teacher! Calm down, teacher! Stop! See what you've done? Good afternoon, says the secretary of Professor Hugo Gomez Pruneda. Please contact the School Coordination Department at extension 16. Angel, this is Hugo. What were you thinking about? You didn’t leave a wet place from the guy! But I'm glad you hit that asshole Gustavo, that's great! Don't worry, we'll sort it out. There have already been complaints about this cretin. He bored us so much. I guarantee you won't be charged. Thanks to me, Gerardo wasn't charged after he fucked a student, so it's out of the question. But you have to tell me everything, I want details! Well, you probably had a face! Teacher, this is Guicho, head girl of the "C" group. I just wanted to say on behalf of the whole group... It's cool that you punched that asshole Gustavo! I was about to hit him myself. I would definitely hit it. Exactly! Honestly, teacher, you did a great job with him! We are all with you. If suddenly you are accused, we will support you. See you on Monday. It was cool! You have called 36135532, please leave a message after the beep. Angel? Yvette? How are you? How are you, teacher? More or less, and you? I don't know what to think. I've never seen you like this. I know I've never behaved like this. But when I saw the state you were in because of... because of Gustavo... And this is your message in the morning... What message? The one you left me on my answering machine this morning. I didn't call you. How come you didn't call? Okay, it doesn't matter now. I want you to tell me the truth: did you beat Gustavo because of me? Yes. Teacher, you're just a darling. I did not know you from this dark side, and I like that you showed it. Risked for me. Why did it happen? Just? You said you want to be with me. Yes, I want it right now! Take a taxi and come, I'll pay. No, today I want you to come to me. What about your neighbor? She won't be here until 6pm. But hurry... Because you turned me on today! I'm just dying to have sex. Crap! Taxi! Sorry handsome. No, no, dove! Bye, I'm late! No! Your mother! You moron, completely off the wheels! Where can I take you, señor? To Isla Mescala 432, please… Where? Parques de Colon area. Parkes Colon? Yes! Via Vista de la Campigna. Vista la Campigna? Damn, bro, do you know La Charla? Ah, yes, yes, yes, yes! No no no! Where are you driving? Directly? Straight? We go right there. Ah, yes, yes. Straight. It's here, here. We've arrived! Good good. Good luck man. Are you in pain? I'm sorry. It hurts a little. Sorry. Your boyfriend has a strong head. Poor fellow. Take it. Where were they? I was looking for them. You left them with me on Monday. Monday was good, wasn't it? Do you want to repeat? Yes please. Link me! Link me! What? I want you to tie me up. After what I saw today, I want you to treat me like a son of a bitch. Are you sure? Do it and see how confident I am. Would you like a drink? Water. I'll bring. Do you love me, Yvette? What you said? Do you love me? Why do you ask? We agreed that there would be nothing serious between us. Yes, but that's not what you said on the phone today. You're all about the message! Look, I don't know how many other coeds you're fucking. But I can say that this girl did me a favor. But Yvette... Hi handsome! It's your turn. I want you to be as cool as me. Bind me. Anything the teacher wants... What's happened? Yvette! ETERNAL MOAN Hello? Home of the Himmelman family. Hello! Carmen... If you had a dream about someone you haven't seen for a long time, what would you do? It depends on what and how, señora. In terms of? How he dreamed me. He slept or cried, was dressed in white or laughed... It happens anyway. How did you feel about him? Ordinary. I don't know... He was smiling! Didn't you dream of him by the river? Was there water? No. So he was smiling? I will answer. Hello? Home of the Himmelman family. Hello! Hello! If they call again... Who was that? Don't know. Mute, probably. Hasn't the number been determined? No, not determined. They're probably calling from a payphone. Some kind of crazy. Calling all morning. And some people like to annoy people! Department of Culture and Art. Hello. This is Margarita. How can I help? Hey Margo, can you connect with Laura? Señora Villalpando is out of the office right now, having breakfast at the Family Development Department. - Something urgent? - Yes! Then I'll try to put you on her cell phone, don't hang up, please. No, no, I'm waiting. In government, we work to make our lives better, so 45 percent of women got insurance for... Listen? Hey girlfriend, are you busy? No, I'm reading some reports here. What's happened? I want to ask for a favor. Well, speak up. Give me a phone number where I can find Angel! OK? Which Angel? The one? Yes, yes, him. My girl! Why do you need him? Just give it all. I'll tell you later. Tell me now or I'm not talking to you! Okay, I'll put it in two words: Today I dreamed about the life that we could have. The life that fate prepared for us. Just this? And how did you live? We were happy! As happy as they were in their youth when they met. I swear I saw clearly all our lives along which we walked together in sorrow and joy, as we always wanted. Faty, were you happier than now? Honestly? Yes. Come on, Fatima! A little more and we will hit forty! Don't act like a stupid girl! Leave it all. You have a settled life with Damian. Angel is still the same unsettled anarchist! So will you give me the phone or not? I don't have it, but if anyone keeps in touch with him, it's Caballo. I can give you his number, but he's in Monterrey right now. I can try to find it there, but it won't be easy. If it's so urgent, look it up in the phone book. Maybe he came to his senses and even got a house... You have called 36135532, please leave a message after the beep. Angel! Angel, pick up the phone! I am always thinking about you! I don't want to be with him anymore! What am I thinking about?! You can't leave him a message like that! Wake up! Think about what you will say to him. The number is busy or does not answer. Leave your message after the beep. Angel, I know it's been many years... You must be angry with me? Of course you're angry... But I really, really need to see you! And you were right: he is not the man of my life. And don't say you warned me. You are stupid, Fatima! No! This is complete nonsense! Your mother! You've reached Angel Flores' number. If you are the type who is afraid to leave a message, hang up immediately, and if not, you know what to do. Angel, it's me. Don't ask anything, just call right back when you hear it. Remember when you once said that interpreting dreams is for the stupid? Give me a call before I turn into one of them, okay? What are you doing, Fatima? Nothing... Nothing. Weren't you supposed to come the day after tomorrow? Yes, I should have, but I was able to buy the patent earlier than I planned. Why didn't you call, I would have met you at the airport? That's exactly what I did. I dialed for you, but it was always busy. It's just that some person was looking for you, and he talked and talked endlessly! Is it true? Did you answer calls? Yes, she answered. I knew that one day it would happen. And today I wanted to talk to you about it. Talk about what? Fatima, don't mock my intellect. You only drink when you're in a crisis. Besides... You dressed the way you dressed before our wedding. And what about the clothes? You said that if one day I cheat on you, you will put on the only clothes you took with you. Come on... Damian, what do you want to say? Are you walking away from me? Don't say that, it sounds vulgar! I tried to avoid it, but... What am I saying? Listen, Fatima, I don't want to insult you with these eternal speeches of bad husbands. In truth, it happened and changed my life forever. Son of a bitch! Please no drama! AMD? AMD? I'll arrange a Greek tragedy for you if I want, damn it! Calm down, Fatima, let's talk like a human being! What the hell do you want to talk about if you've already fucked everything up! About your future. I don't want to leave you on the street. I want to give you what you deserve. Go to hell, goat! I don't need a damn thing from you! Sorry if I'm being rude, but that's the kind of me you met! Son of a bitch! Well, you are a bastard! I'm coming! What's wrong with you, princess? What's happened? I still think it's too early for a drink. It's aperitif time in Barcelona. Well, you've had a great day! Who would have expected this from Damian? What a bastard he is! And who knows how long he sleeps with another? How convenient! He has two women, and I'm stupid. It's good that it was revealed. It would be worse to continue this farce. No, it would be worse if he was spotted. How pathetic and funny he is! I swear, if this hadn't happened to me, I would have died laughing. But it's not fair that you're left with nothing. Did you take your credit cards or any cash? No and I do not want. In this I came to his house, in the same I left. And the jeep? If he wants, let him take it! Idiot! Won't you answer? I don't want to talk to him! What if it's not him? What happened to you? Hello? Hello skinny. Angel? Angel! You have no idea how happy I am to hear from you after so many years! Not a day has passed in these seven years that I have not thought of you. Is it true? You know yes. You were always the only woman I couldn't lie to. Yes, no one was as honest as you. Are you not angry with me? Of course not, it's a thing of the past, you were just a girl! Do you want us to see you? Yes, I want us to start over! Will you follow me? Oh no, I can't, I have to take the petitions to Congress but we can meet at 4 pm at Ernesto's bar. Yes, like before. We'll meet there! But don't make me wait again in vain. I've been waiting for this with all my heart! Angel! Remember, you told me that you would wait for me as long as it takes? Certainly! I promised it from my heart and I keep my word. I kiss you. I have you twice. I will see him again! I will see him again! I will see him again! I heard, I heard! See? He's been waiting for me all these years, poor thing! Waited me! Okay, so what are you going to do? I will leave with him. This sounds great! Do you like it? Yeah. This is our new DJ. I'm flying to LA tonight to sign him. This guy is a genius! Have you already laid eyes on him? Do I know you! No, he is an absolute hetero. I'm not going to influence him and change his orientation. I am happy with Diego. - Stop the car, Milton! - What? For what? Stop the car! Damian is there. I need to talk to him! Please leave it as it is! I have a plan! Sorry, but you can't get through like this! If you want to call the police, I'll leave before they get here! Sorry! Change your face, okay? I am not guilty. You told me to call, but you didn't answer! I was on a plane! I'm sorry! Diego! Crap! What are you doing here? What are you doing here, cretin?! What happened, motherfucker? Hey, what's wrong with you? You are to blame for everything! I? Don't interfere with me. Why am I here? If you were a good wife to Damian, he wouldn't date Diego! Really? I can say the same about you if the kid was good with you, he wouldn't go to another, would he? Sorry baby! Why are they all like this? Because all men are bastards. Except you. And Angel. We better go, right? I don't want you to be late for your date. And we have to buy you clothes! It's here? Are you sure you don't want me to go with you? No. Thank you so much for everything, Milton! OK, bye! Bye! Would you like something to drink? Ernesto is here? Girlfriend, you're back! Wait! Che Ernesto! How are you Like me?! Fat, grey, old, high cholesterol! I can only fuck twice a day, because on the third my knees are already trembling! So it's the same as before! Well, yes! It's great to have you here! What's up? I arranged to meet Angel here. Damn with this guy! He just called me and said that he would not have time to come. And for you to come to his house. I don't know where he lives. Lives in hell, but I'll tell you for sure. Wait a minute! History always repeats itself, right? Exactly. From the time of Christ to the present day. Here. Don't be scared, it's simple. Two blocks from here you take the train and get off at the last station. Can you lend me a ticket? Gosha! Does the girl have change? Only large bills? Wow! No no! It's a lot! Take a hundred, suddenly you need it! Thank you! I think we'll see you here again. Let's! Good luck! Put the horns on this goat! Skinny? You always had an answer for everything. What should be said in such cases? What comes from the soul, skinny. I'm sorry for everything I've done to you, Angel! No. I know what to do to change your mind. Seriously. I want to correct my mistakes! What happened to your ideal husband? Time has shown that you were right. And now you know exactly what you want? Are you sure you want to quit everything? Yes! You are the man of my life and I won't let you go. I love you. What are your plans? What are you going to do? Don't know. Probably stay here. Do you want to go to the beach where we met? Yes. How wonderful! It's like starting over, right? Yes. Wait for me here! Can we go tomorrow? Today was a terrible day. It's not my suitcase, it's yours! Like this? Here are all the things you left behind that I couldn't throw away. All this reminded me of you. But I couldn't break them, despite the rage that consumed me. The princess escaped so easily. She sold herself like a whore to the first rich man who came across. And she didn't care that it would ruin my life. Why were all our plans needed? Where are your ideals? Where did you leave me? You ruined everything, Fatima, for fucking money, and now you think that you can go back, as if nothing had happened, and change the past? No, you're wrong, skinny, not right at all. Is that what you wanted to tell me? Why did you lie on the phone then? Do you know why? Really, you want to know? Because you have no idea what hell I went through while you were traveling! You left me without any remorse! But you know what? I've waited all these years for an opportunity to make you feel the same way. Finally he introduced himself to me! Angel, don't do this to me! I do not have anyone. I have nothing! I gave up everything for you! Skinny, welcome to the club! It's wonderful here! Is it true? Honey, you've got a call from San Cristobal, it's long distance. I'll be right there. Don't delay, okay? Are you in love with her just like you were with me? Such mistakes are not repeated. Do you want to start over? Then go ahead, little one! Roll you... DEAD GENERATIONS DITE - 40 KM No, listen... The thing is, it's very urgent. I know, but you have to help me. What? I will pay even more than the price. Okay, okay. Thank you very much. Well, what did they say? What they can't. That it's Friday and they can't fix it or come. They want me to leave her until Monday. What nonsense! What a goat this Chayo. He's probably already at the party. Do you have a phone number for another workshop? No. Crap... Do you want more beer? Can I leave my wreck here? What are you going to do? I will vote, someone will give me a lift. I have to find out who my sister is dating. How are you, buddy? Do you really need in Dita? I would sell my soul to the devil to get there. Then don't go anywhere. How are you, queen? What's up? How's your beast brother? Angry as usual, but especially today. And today I'm just very affectionate. Now, don't come near me. I don't want to provoke him. Do you want beer? When are you going to color this hair? They don't suit you. Soon. Rosa will arrive now, she will finish one hairstyle and come. What kind of boobs do you have! And who is the owner of this sloppy car that is standing outside? Gee, buddy. It will be hard to fix it. Why is this? Don't worry my king, we will help him. Indeed? Yes. He needs to go to Dita, but his car is not moving. Damn, okay, I'll take him. I'll be your taxi driver, buddy. World man. What, are you in a hurry? To be honest, yes. Just waiting for you. Then let's go, we'll get there in forty minutes. Calculate me please. Are you coming at night, handsome? Of course, I'll just go home to freshen up. Read later. Thanks for all. Could you keep an eye on my "sucks car", okay? See? He's a jerk. Let's go, boy. See you. Chofa is so kind, isn't she? What? Sophia, my sweetheart, kind soul, right? Yes, very kind, very kind. Yes, and good in bed! I love. But she has a nasty brother, a bore, gets her every day. He seemed to have sniffed out that we were dating. She says that I'm old for her, that I'm not serious. She denies everything. She said that she had a young boyfriend, and she would soon introduce him to him. Yes, it always happens when there is a difference in age. You are not the only one. So always, if a girl has too harmful and annoying relatives. True, right? To hell with cases. And then it gets worse and worse, you have to meet secretly. Exactly, they don’t let them live normally, enter the family... get and get, so you meet, just to have sex. You are our man, boy! Joel Villaseñor, at your service. Angel Flores Fuentes. What are you doing here? It says on your car that you take pictures and videos. Are you looking for a job? No, I came because of the girl. Have you traveled this far just because of a girl? My grandmother correctly said that girls weigh more than all the gold in the world. Your wise grandmother! But to be honest, I don't know what will happen. Everything is so strange. What are you! Why? I haven't seen her in a long time, a year or more. And suddenly she calls me and leaves such a message that I immediately got up. Angel! At first I thought it was someone else, but then I recognized her voice. Well well! And what did she say? That she was sick of being with that cretin she married that she repents, that she desperately needs and wants to see me. So is she married? Do you have a married woman from Dite? Well, you're an asshole, man! Good story. No, not at all. We don't meet anymore. We met before, but that was a long time ago. We had a great time. And then she met this rich old goat from the ranch and left me. What is her name? I know her for sure. The town is small. Eva Figueroa. Here's how? It's not true, man, don't lie. Honestly. Such a beautiful woman, you know? Still would! The coolest chick in Dita. Believe me, there was not a single man who would not roll up to her, but this bitch is very faithful to her husband. You've got eyes like an eagle, man. Do you know her husband? He's already very old, right? I saw him once in a photograph. Old donkey. He got us all. I thought a lot about myself. He has a bad head. I don't think he gets up anymore. Maybe that's why she's so mad and wants to send him to hell? No offense, but honestly, this is way too fancy ham for your scrambled eggs. Yes, Maybe, but for the sake of such a woman, you can go to hell, don't you agree? Imagine how much you want her now, asshole! Will you be all right? Certainly. As crazy as her husband is, he's an old wreck. He is not a hindrance to me. Thanks for all. Not at all, boy. You will pay me back if you fuck Eva well on behalf of the whole village. Let her scream! It is necessary! I'm your fan man! I am your fan! Thank you. Hello. It's you? What the hell are you doing here? What? What the hell are you doing here? I came because you called me. I? Why should I call you? You left a message on the answering machine. Angel, I don't even have a phone. This one was just installed today. What do you want? Are you really not happy to see me or are you pretending like you always do? Look, Angelito, it's not that I'm not happy, but I've got a lot to do, and the lights went out. Tell me how to help you and leave me alone. You called me and said you couldn't live without me. I can not live without you? Angel, you may not believe it, but as you can see, I live wonderfully without you. Who knows who called you, who left a message... he's probably already in a mental hospital. If I were you, I'd go back home and find out who was playing a joke on me. No, I'm not leaving here until you explain everything to me. So you explain everything? Okay, I'll explain. We had something with you, it was nice, but it's gone. Everything is over. You have no place in my life, Angel. Let's just say I don't need you. So go back to your house and say hello to the guys from the area. No, baby, wait, wait! Get down from there! I've wanted to talk to you for so long! Get out of there, I tell you. Get down, you son of a bitch. Get out before my husband comes. Everything you want to tell me, I already know, you said it to me through the roof, and I will answer you, as always: no, no and no! It's all over, okay? Get out! And then I'll set the dogs on you. Bitch, she's always like this with me. And I'm a tasty morsel! Goat, he's good enough for her father. Son of a bitch! Where are you, handsome? What? Where are you soaping? You know I don't want problems. Do not want? No, that's why I'd better leave. No, puppy. You said here that you came to my wife, and you will fuck her. So do it! What? You came to eat this apple and you have to eat it, nerd. Leave me alone! How could I know, I saw you with another. No, I'm not such a jerk as you to sleep with only one chick. Shut up and go to the house. You are crazy! Do as I say or I will shoot you and tell you that you are a thief. Don't be stupid, Joel, he'll shoot. He will shoot when I want him to. Go, moron! Fuck my wife. But why? Becauze I whant so. I will fulfill your wish. But look... If Eva finds out that I made you... You were sure that she would agree, right? So come on, cretin, go ahead! Go! Fuck what have I gotten myself into! What are you doing in my house? How did you get in? Wait! I need to explain something to you! I don't care, get out of my house! Wait, you don't understand. You don't understand, cretin, I'll put a bullet in you if you don't leave. Eva, I came to tell you that your husband is cheating on you! How do you know that, idiot? Your man is cheating on you. Angel, you don't even know my husband. By the way, his name is Joel Villaseñor. Anyone in the village could tell you that. Go away! Wait, he's got a red Jeep, he's blond, and he's fucking a girl from a highway bar. How do you like it? That dyed blonde? Yes, that's right, I think her name is... Sofia! But he calls her Chofa. Chofa... What a sweet son of a bitch. Yes, they told me about it. I saw him kiss her. You are sure? I swear! I even heard them arrange to meet tonight at the bar. You did not confuse him with anyone, Angel? No, no, I didn't tell you before because I didn't know he was your husband. And then you said you married a rich old man. Yes, it was his father. Angel, you have your cameras with you, right? Of course, I always carry them with me. And what? Will you help me. I need to go there and film this son of a bitch cheating on me. But the photos must be clear in order for the judge to accept them as evidence. How is it a judge? What judge? It's a long story. Angel, I'll tell you one thing. I know you won't believe me, but I'll tell you anyway. I married Joel's father because I fell madly in love with him. It can't be, Eva. For this you need to have a heart. I also thought I didn't have it. I do not trust you. You forbade yourself to love. I know, but life is a cruel bitch, Angelito. I acted like a pig with men until I met this old man. Handsome and very rich. I just wanted to get his money. But I fell in love like a girl, and he suddenly died. Here's the bastard! Happiness did not last long, life took revenge on me and took him away. Why did you marry his son? Joel has been following me like a dog since he saw me. I was alone and did not want to leave here. We decided to marry for the sake of inherited property, so as not to sue, because we are both heirs. And then he came up with this brilliant idea... Sign a contract and swear forever to be faithful to each other. If one of us cheats on the other, the victim will receive the entire inheritance, if he has photo or video evidence. We both had a dark past, and this paper would have protected us. I agreed because I knew that he would give up first. Of course, the marriage soon went to hell. We couldn't stand each other anymore. Further it was worse. He was offered a huge fortune for this estate. He was very happy. I said he would have to kill me before I left here. I didn't understand... If you both benefit from this deal, why not break the contract, get a divorce, and let everyone go with their money and sleep with whoever they want? Because I want to keep this house. Not for ambition. Only for love. For what love? This house is my husband's mausoleum. Hoel's father is buried right under this floor. He's been building this house all his life, and I won't let that son of a bitch sell it. I won't let him take the one place I was happy from. To do this, I need to prove that this cretin Hoel is cheating on me. And you, Angelito, will help me, won't you? Damn, she's crazy! Well? Well, when, goat? You're pulling too hard. It seems to me that you chickened out. No, no, just... Just what, goat? It's... It's your fault! Gosha! In what? She told me that around this time you come back and she is afraid that you will find us. Yes, it is true. And she wants me to death. Here's a bitch! She has always been so approachable. I did my job, now it's your turn. My turn? What do you mean, moron? Call and tell her you'll be late. So you will free me the field. Okay, okay. And you yourself can be perverted with your camera as you like, if you want to film us here. Do you care? No, I don't mind, I'll just ask you for a copy, okay? Listen, are you good at these things? Check the night shot button? I don't want you to come out illegible. Here. - All right, I'll call you now. - Yes. - Grab her now, she's in my room. - OK. I know where to hide in order to get a better picture of you. Yes Yes Yes. What are you staring at, moron? I'll be watching you, you asshole. Yes, yes, fine. Eva! You were right. That cynic bitch just called and told me not to wait that he's on a farm three hours away. He must have gone to this girl. See? I told you, but you didn't believe. But he'll pay for it, you'll see. We will track them down and catch them right at the moment of treason, and you will photograph them. Let's go! Where? How is it where? To work, to this whore's bar. No, not now! How is it not? Why? Because first I want to sleep with you. Angel, don't be stupid! No, no, no, I'll take pictures, I'll go to the judge, I don't need money... The only thing I need is to be with you one more time. This is my price. And is it needed right now? Yes. Why do you think I agree? Where are you going to get another photographer? They're not on this damn ranch. No, baby, if you want a house, you gotta earn it. Yes, that's right... Do you want to receive an advance? Can't you wait? Baby, I know you. I better be safe. I am your ticket to win this house, and that is my price. In addition, we have time: the bar closes at least at one in the morning. Until the girl is finished, your husband will have to wait for her. You are a self-serving, heartless fool. But you know what? As you wish! Today I will try as never before, I will fuck you until you turn blue, so the photos should be great, understand? The more affectionate and sweet you are, the better they will turn out. I'll act like I like you, okay? But not here, so let's go! Where? How where? To the motel, near this girl's bar. I don't want to miss them. Went! Ah, well, I don't care. Me too. Knowing you in bed, I don't think we'll be staying long. This is the bar! I don't see Hoel's jeep, do you? These guys closed the review. He must be in there. No, I think it's best to go back and make sure. Suddenly he's not there? No, no, if we go out and he sees you, everything is lost. Better go to the motel and be back soon. They won't leave anyway, the bar is full of people. I trust you. Got it, cretin? Yes. Good evening, are there rooms available? Jacuzzi room please. Sorry, everyone's busy. No! Like this? Weekend. Is there nothing left at all? If you are not too capricious, we have one small number left, but there the garage is littered with bricks. Sorry, we're under renovation. The room is clean, but you can't put the car in the garage. Can I park near the room? Certainly. We weren't going to rent out this number, but if you're so urgent... What time will the jacuzzi room be available? Angel, enough, let it be what it is. We agreed that you will spoil me so that I can fulfill your order well. I want us to take a bath together. So are you taking the number? If not, let the truck pass. Listen, handsome. Why don't we do it right here? We'll make a quick deal, you click the photo, we'll come back, choose a room for you, and we'll keep rolling as much as you want, all night, how do you like it? OK. But with one condition: first you go to the bar, check if Hoel is there. I won't rest until I know for sure. And I will wait for you in my heart. Okay, I'm fast. Park there further, señora, now they will take payment from you. Yes thank you. Where are you going? I need to go to the bar. Some guys are breaking my car. Your wreck is worth nothing. Where is Eva, the goat? Inside, waiting for me. Cretin. Why did you come here? Do you really want to know? Hey, hey, be careful man! She didn't want to desecrate the bed you slept on. She loves You. Goat! Honestly. Baby boy! This goat loves no one but himself. Did it hurt you? "Honestly, honestly"... Are you an idiot? What's the matter? Come on, nerd, you have five minutes to get into bed with Ava. Come on, let's go there. No, we can't go there, all the rooms are taken. And if she sees your jeep, all is lost. - Okay, when you find her, let me know. - Fine. Let's. Have you seen a girl with dark hair? Does she look like a rich woman? Yes, like that. Yes, she just asked for extra towels. OK, thank you. She's in the shower, I'll go in. Okay, leave the door open. Just don't make noise. OK. Eva! What the heck?! What are you doing at this motel? I was looking for you. Who did you come with? What? Don't play dumb, who did you come with, freak? Alone, I came alone. I'm not like you. No, you're even worse. Where is that girl you lied about? What girl? Chofa? So you are Chofa? Very nice, I'm the wife of that type. You bastard! Cretin! Hey, calm down, calm down! First tell me: what were you doing in this room? I was waiting for my boyfriend. I left him a note today. Really, dear? How nice! She calls him "dear". Why did you make an appointment with him? To say that I'm pregnant. Ava, I swear I don't even know her. Well, you and the goat! And bastard! Say goodbye to home, Joelito. You can't prove anything, bitch! Oh no? And her belly? Stomach? What belly? What the hell is your belly?! Don't pretend! What shall we say to my brother? Say that he will become an uncle. Eva! Eva! Eva dear! I swear to you, I don't know her brother! Idiot! Get out! Don't even think you got it, bitch! No? I'll tell you this, Joelito: I didn't just snatch it. This house is already mine. Not yet, goat. Oh no? What about the baby she's expecting? Get out! What the hell? What the hell! Eva, don't make a fool out of me! I do not care! Let them do a DNA test! Let them prove it's true! Don't care about DNA, there are witnesses: the waitress, Angel... Angel? Fucking moron! No, no, wait, no, no! Fucking moron! Eva, I swear to you! Stop, motherfucker! Stop! Eva, I swear to you! Eva! Eva! Excuse me, can you help me? It was he? No, it's not me... Chofa, explain to them what's the matter! Please! No! Chofa! Chofa, tell them it's not me... Chofa! Trash!
