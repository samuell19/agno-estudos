THE HONORABLE ANGELINA I already gave you 200 lire yesterday. But we had to eat yesterday too, right, Pasquà? - Yeah. What's today? - 14th. Still a long way to go! I can ask for another advance, but it won't be easy to get so soon. I still have 60 lire, besides the pasta vouchers. I can ask Cesira for a little oil. Let's hope Antonio pays me tomorrow for the pants I made. He should've paid 2 months ago. I'd like to know why we're made to eat everyday? And I'd like to know why we gotta pay to eat? You gotta earn your living. But it's not enough. - Wages are what they are. Pasquà, you gotta do something. Kids don't care about that. You don't blame me for living honestly? - This ain't living, Pasquà. This is dying honestly. We didn't need that to wake up. Now the party starts! There, there, darling. There. Adriana! Libero! Let's go! Get up, it's late! Mama, let me sleep! - Come on, you'll be late for work! Let me sleep a bit. - No! Hurry! Move it! We need to get the pasta and better to get there early! Hey! What do they want? What should they want? They're journalists! How many live in that one room? - 11. And your husband? - He's a street cleaner. My husband's unemployed for 3 months. We have 4 kids. Put that in your paper. Giacomozzi! Yes, you're quite right! There's only one latrine on the older side of the slum. It's indecent! If only we could strike. - And not even doors! Is it true they'll make us bathrooms? - How should a reporter know? They were to give us houses with all the facilities. See them? Are they housing projects? - Not for the likes of us! Mr. Callisto was to make a co-op, but was never heard since. Now he's building for the rich. And we gotta stay here. When it rains in winter we go around by boat, y'know? Why don't you write about that? Blow harder! Look! Someone who still keeps clean. Take a picture. Let's go inside. What manners! We only wanted a picture! She did right. We're not here to play! It's just a photo.. - And she doesn't know that? There's nothing to photograph here. We're not film divas! We're poor, get it? Instead of these contraptions, bring us some money! Then we can make ourselves nice and save you the trip! Am I right? - Let's go. You think those journalists just come here for the fun of it? They come to see, to check up, to take interest. They come to stick their noses in. To put a nice photo in the paper, underneath written: "Angelina's House". "Look how nice it is, how wretched!" "The children covered in lice, 7 in the family," "sleeping in 2 rooms, they don't have a penny," "and for snack: they eat their toenails!" "How happy they make you feel! So uplifting!" If only it helped anything! We're sentenced to poverty and there's nothing we can do. Come on, hurry up, please! Won't you give up that bad habit of eating? Give it to me. Let go of the bread! Come on, go get the pasta. Here are the vouchers. Put something on, it's cold. And hurry or you'll be late for school! She'll make me late! You only had to spot clean it! Please, hurry up. - Papa, who are you arresting today? I'll tell you tonight. Now get down and beat it. Hey! Well? Aren't you getting up? The garage opens at noon. - Get up anyway. It's 8. I've nothing to do! - Walk around, get some air! I don't want to see you in bed while I go to work. Let me sleep a little! There's no peace in this house! I've got the soccer game! Let me rest! - And the garage? I got that too, OK? Damn! You hear the rubbish he says? - Get up, Libero. Up! Mom, is it my fault the garage opens at noon and he has to go to work? Get him up or I'll kill him. - Get up. Who gives a crap if I sleep late? You speak to your mom like that? Forget it! First I make them then you wanna kill them? - Fine! Better I go or else it'll end badly! Papa, wait a minute. Me too. Bye hon. Come right back or the pasta will get overcooked. Now I can get some sleep. Thanks, Ma. What's up? - Next time, I'll slap you silly, if you don't get up at 8. Understand? Learn to respect your poor father. Remember that! Come here, mama's darling, come! Mama, mama! They won't give the pasta! What do you mean? - It's not there, it hasn't arrived! Be still. Why didn't it arrive? - How should I know? What's this talk? Mr. Benedetto said yesterday it would be here. But it wasn't and they gave me nothing. Nothing. I can't take it anymore! The paper said it was given out 3 days ago. Libero.. Libero, get up! Bring me my scarf and jacket! What can you do, Angelina? Benedetto does as he likes. Nice, Mr. Benedetto! - Give me the vouchers. Let's go see what happened. These kids gotta eat! I'll come too, Angelina. Uncle Joe's gotta come! Come on, sweetie, go on! Mr. Benedetto, what's this? Why aren't you giving pasta? Because there's none. - Why do other places have it? My cousin got hers yesterday. - And I'll give it tomorrow. Then you have it? - Yes, Ma'am, I do. If you have it, why won't you give it? It rained yesterday. It was left at the warehouse. I'll get it today and you'll get it tomorrow. But Mr. Benedetto, I have 5 kids. I can't tell them they can't eat when it rains. Angelina, if you have 5 kids, then tell it to your husband. Be nice, Mr. Benedè and get the pasta. We'll wait right here, OK? Sure! Leave my business to serve you! 700 lire, Ma'am. A full liter. But you've time for the black market, eh? Mrs. Angelî, in this store, I'm the boss. And I'll do what I want. Then tell me this.. With the 60 lire my husband gave me, what'll the black market give me? A 100g of pumpkin seeds. - Oh, yeah? And I have to give my 5 kids pumpkin seeds for lunch? That's your lookout. - No, it's your lookout. You have kids too, but my husband doesn't do the black market to get by! My husband gets by on his wages. Now go get us that pasta! - No, Angelì, I won't. Oh, yes, you will! - No, I won't give you a damn thing! That's it, let's go! Get out! Out! What'll I give my kids if you don't give me pasta? Magic tricks for lunch and dinner? - Yeah, give them that. What a wretch! - Angelì, this will end badly. Badly? For who? Badly for you! Everyday the same story, "Tomorrow"! While you get fat and we starve! - You've said too much! I'll kill him! This bastard! This is not over! - Thief! Thief! The more they bully, the fatter they get! I want that pasta! Even if I start another world war! What can we do? Nothing! - Nothing? I'll show you! Come on, girls! - What is this ruckus? We've come to get the pasta! - We know that it's here! Mr. Benedetto told us. Leave or I'll get the police! Like we care! Adriana! Come on, they're giving the pasta! Hurry or you'll lose your place! Hello? Hello? Hello, Mr. Benedè! What! - It's a nightmare! - Call the guards, you idiot! What is it, Mr. Benedetto? Watch the shop for me! I gotta get some pasta too! Stop or I'll have you arrested! - They should arrest you, you marketeer! The police! Beat it! They've ruined me! Go after them! They've taken everything! Everything! Marshal, you must put all of them in jail! I demand to be protected and everything returned that was taken! Who should I arrest? - Angelina for starters. She instigated the other women. You don't know the damage they caused! They broke my counter, smashed all the windows. They took 200 freakin' kilos of pasta! And 300 kilos of sugar! - 300? Of course! 200 kilos of "00" flour and 100 kilos of white bread. And how is it you had all this stuff? Well, "All this stuff".. Well, you know, Marshal, it's really all relative.. and.. it's intrinsic value was barely anything. Wouldn't you say so? - Yeah, actually.. OK, but it's better then to file an official report. Oh, never mind! Maybe those poor women were starving. And I've so much to do, I gotta go.. - Oh, no, no. It'd be better you stay here and make out a list.. of the goods you're missing. - Ah, I.. must? Yes, you. Your name? Benedetto Zampignoni, son of Oreste. WOMAN TEACHES BLACK MARKETEER A LESSON 150,000 LIRE FINE TO A HOARDER PROVOKED BY PIETRALATA WOMAN "DOWN WITH HOARDERS", SAYS ANGELINA Just look! You're as big as a soccer star! You'll be in movies next! - Oh, cut it out! Next time take care. - Why? - So you can wear a good dress! Angelina! Coming! Angelì! - What is it? This is you're doing. - You scared me! - I wanna thank you! Have a drop, go on! - Thanks! Cheers! The folks of the district want to put you at the head of a Committee. Will you stop pulling my leg! - Fine, so long. Hey, see ya! They've all gone nuts! They want to me to head a Committee! I'm not surprised, Angelì, you've the gift of the gab! It's a pleasure to hear you. - But I never raise my voice! It's you who can shout up a storm, eh, Carmela? You put feeling into it, you're better than a trumpet! - You gotta do it more often! Yeah, the papers talk a lot, but have never helped us. How many fights we could make! For the electricity, for water! Must we drink stinking water because a few jerks won't come and fix the pipes? Excuse me, the pasta might overcook. - And the toilets, what about them? It's filth now! And the bus stops 2 kilometers from here as if we had shoes to spare! We're poor and they take advantage! - How many fights we'd have to do! Angelì, what would you say if we made another little rumpus? I'm making no promises, eh? Not yet! - Smells so good! Give them here, come on. - Let's eat! Papa! Today, we're having pasta with sauce! Pasquà! Come sit down and have some pasta! - Might as well. Did he find out? So, he knows? What could I do? I have kids! Give me the plates! Give me your plate or it'll drip! That other one, go on! You really don't want any? - No! Who cares? We'll eat it ourselves! At Pietralata you must give us water! - Fill out the form. Form? We've had no water for 3 months! To hell with your forms! We did it, eh? Get off! Go away! Sit down over there! Hello! Hello, the Depot! BUS TERMINAL WELFARE OFFICE WELFARE DINING HALL Mama, will you buy me a boat? - Yes. And a diving suit? - Sure. What if you won't? - Cut it, Peppino, you're worse than the flood. Put them there, thanks. Sit there. Here. Watch out! Angelì, they'll get sick here. What are we going to do? And it's good for us? If this is the water cure, we're in trouble! Our kids can't stay like this! What do you say, Angelì? Something must be done. Every year it's the same. Wish our landlord lived here a while! Bastard! Instead of building a dyke, he builds palaces! Luckily, they're not done yet, else he'd see! That's what you say. The outside's not done yet, but the inside is almost ready. Angelì, I've an idea. You think you're the only one? Hold on to her. Wait here. Mama has something to do. What are you saying? Call from Pietralata, Marshal. Yes, hello? What? They're occupying what? I'll see to it immediately! Call the others! - Muster the 2nd squad! This one's taken, for heaven's sake! It's mine! Arrest her! She's the one responsible! She! - What do you want? I told you you'd finish badly! - But I'll.. Brigadier! Come and help me! Brigadier, are you leaving? Come here, wait! Wretch! - Stop it now. Bastard! - Angeli', stop it! Don't touch me! I didn't do anything! Got it? Go away! No need to push, I'll go myself! - I'll get in by myself! We have to sleep in the middle of the street with our kids? Check that out! He's arresting his wife! Angeli', I'll take care of your place! - Mama, are you bringing me? Uncle Joe's gotta come! Hello? Commendatore, what must I do? Yes, I'm at the station. No, don't move from there! How many times must I tell you? I'll come myself or send someone! I won't give a penny more until the building is finished! We're contracted to be done by 2 months. And there'll be a penalty for delays! Friend, this is force majeure. When the building's free, I'll do what I must! You won't get rid of them if you don't act now. In 11 months of lawsuits and promises they still haven't freed the other area! The truth is you want no complications. You're scared. Scared of what? - Don't play dumb! In '37, when the State gave to those who built public housing a contribution of 4,000 lire per room, he made two deals. He pocketed the contribution and used his land, that's worthless because every winter it floods, in order to build slums. Here's the consequence of the fine business you did then! And you'll pay for it, my friend. I've no part in this. In 2 months you must deliver the buildings, ready and empty. Do as you think best. - We can still agree.. - No, we can't! This is the contract. I won't add or remove a word. It's useless to continue an unpleasant discussion. I'm sorry, Callisto, but I too am unable to.. Excuse me, Dad, but it's easy: If you fix the houses in the flooded zone, making them habitable, why should it be hard, once the flood is over, to get the people to leave the buildings? So I should waste money on those unprofitable shacks? It seems you profited from them already. If only you'd fix them.. Those poor people must live too. - Ah, you're still young, my boy! With such ideas you'll never do business! But let's not waste time. Quick, get the car and go to the station with the accountant. Find out what can be done and call me. - OK, Dad. Commissioner, you must listen to me! Silence! Silence! Silence! Ma'am! Psst! You.. Who? Me? - Yes, you. What do you want? Identification. Did you go insane? First and last name. Just look at him! He likes to play Vice-Brigadier! Just look! Hey, you! Want to get a few years for outraging authority? What authority? That's her husband! - Yes, Marshal. My wife. Marshal Ricciardi. Pleased to meet you. Likewise. There he is! Isn't he nice? - Isn't he ashamed to be seen? Who's he? - Mr. Garrone, the landlord. Yeah? Wait here a moment. Look.. Please, be kind. Make them free Mama. Me? - Yes, you. Her name is Angelina. She's done nothing wrong. She must nurse the baby. - OK, but what have I to do with it? You are Mr. Garrone? - Yes. Then please let her out. If you say so, they'll let her go. But I don't understand. If they arrested her, they had a reason, right? Yes, there is a reason. See? Let me pass. The reason is you only think of your own affairs and don't give a damn about us! I should've have known! You're really a no-good Shylock, just like Mama said! She's to blame for what happened! - Right, she instigated the others! Shut up, you weren't there! - Marshal, you must intervene! Be quiet! Isn't it enough you leave us roofs with holes? We sleep with an umbrella! Isn't it enough you built those slums in an useless bog that's good for nothing? It's only since July 25th that the papers have spoken of the scandal! You want us to drown! - We've works in progress, delivery dates! Delivery? What delivery? They must do their business, Marshal! They only want to build new flats instead of repairing our homes! You must come to an agreement. - I'm sorry, I can't act. I'll go get instructions. - Good, go instruct yourself! You too, try to agree. - Agree to what, Marshal? Will you invite us to your house tonight? Or shall we let our kids get pneumonia? Yes, they arrested those responsible. What? You don't want to press charges? I really don't understand. No, no journalists around. Don't worry. Fine, as you wish. ANGELINA GETS THE BETTER AGAIN FLOOD VICTIMS OCCUPY APARTMENTS SCANDAL OVER THE HOUSES BUILT UNDER THE RIVERBANK? I can't go on anymore. - What a shame, Angelì. We had kept for you the nicest rooms, with blue tiles and a bath. Here we are. - What can you do? My husband didn't like them. Orders from high. - I'd give him myself orders from high! Give me strength! We're regimented worse than back then, at my house. We just need the goose-step and we're set. Thanks and goodnight. Let's go. All is ready, Angelì! Here you sleep like Popes! Tomorrow I'll fix you over there. There's a free spot. You can put all the furniture you got, as if it were your own house. Thank you for the trouble. - Make yourself at home. Mama, wasn't it nice with the blue tiles? - Yes, it sure was. But your dad didn't like it. - Now you're turning the kids against me? No, not me. It was the voice of innocence. Angelina, don't get upset! Have a good sleep! Angelì, won't you realize I can't live in a house got by violence? I'm not just anyone. I'm a police Vice-Brigadier! I know, you've been telling me for 15 years! When we married it seemed like you'd make General in a week! Not in front of the kids! - No, it's better they hear, so the girls know better than to make the same mistake I did! You hear her? How you can live with a woman like this? Why did I marry you? If only I'd drowned myself on my marriage day! You don't help a man, you kill him slowly! Hey, when can one sleep in this house? - You, shut up! Papa, will you buy me a boat? - Yeah, tomorrow, tomorrow. And a diving suit? Sure, but try to sleep now. So I kill you slowly, eh? You destroy, annihilate. Fine. What's wrong now? - Nothing. No, spit it out or there'll be no sleep. I know you. It's the carriage. We'll be better tomorrow. No, it's not that. This is the first time I'm in a carriage since I married. Back then you didn't wish to drown. I was to become a General. Well, it went badly for you. It went badly for you too. It's not true, because.. after all, we're still in love, but.. The trouble is we're always fighting. Of course. You always get on my nerves! I fear that if you do more of your tricks, I'll never become a brigadier. Not for me, y'know? For you all. Well, that's how I am, when I see something wrong, I blow my top, I can't help but scream. But you had to arrest me! I felt like dying. And I didn't? Don't think about it. Let's sleep. Yes, you're right. It's better to sleep. Angelì, tell me, have you never thought of politics? I'm no fool. What a shame! Within 2 months you'd be more famous than Gasperi! I told you: You must join the Party! Which Party? - Read this brochure. While at it, read this one too. - Which Party is this? Actually, I'm a historical Republican, but I'm also a centrist anarchist. So what? - I'm just saying! - What does that mean? - What it means? Anarchist means anarchist! And centrist? What's centrist? It's centrist! So clear! - Evening, Mrs. Angelina. Evening. - Evening. Angelina, could you sew my trousers? If you're not in a hurry, because I've a ton of work. See? See the luxury of capitalists, Angelì? You see? They'll come from New York to order trousers! - But I come first, Angelì. Don't let him fool you, he's a monarchist, liberal, apathetic Christian Democrat! A true reactionary! - Knock off the name calling. Look, since I'm here, I'd like to talk over something with you. - What did I say? The female section of our Party is organizing a charity distribution for disaster victims in the slums. How nice! First they make you poor now they want to give you scraps. That's part of your denigrating systems! - That's the holy truth! I don't speak to people who don't know what they say! - It's you who don't know! Our agenda is in 2 words: bread and work! And wine! - Ah, the laughter! You do your best to make people slog like beasts and then feed them only bread. How easy! Too easy! That's not an agenda! Unlike you, eh? - No, we want to give them pasta and roast chicken! Are you happy? We don't want.. Excuse me, Ma'am, We don't want them to become wretchedly poor, like you do! We want everybody to become capitalists! Bread, work, wine and.. prosciutto from the mountain! My hands are itching. - Of course. Did you hear that, Angelina? This is their agenda: arrogance and violence! Say it again and I'll break your face! - Hey, hey! What's that? Be good! You're always fighting! Angelina, here is the material. By sheer coincidence, I was reading an article that seemed your picture. Listen to this, Angelina. And then they have it in for us. "These stinking, money-grubbing petty politicians do nothing but vomit crap." "It is time for they all took a train and went abroad." "It's time to flush the toilet, they've broken our.." - Hey! There are children here! - So? It even makes me blush. - It makes everybody blush! It's a shame that these Parties which spring up like mushrooms without a solid, classic, age-old tradition! Moldy, outdated. Outdated? Say that again! In man, an idea is born from the moment, necessity, circumstances! Listen, please! Can't it be born outside? Cause I gotta work! Honestly! As you wish. We'll talk again when I'll come for the final test. No, I'm not interested. - You must be interested. You'll go far! If you want, you can get all the votes of the poor around the slums of Rome! And they're many, you know? - Well, so what? Look, I wouldn't be surprised if some day we should call you "Honorable Angelina"! Honorable Angelina, me? Don't make me laugh. Bye, guys! Take care of yourselves, eh? Night! - Bye. He's crazy. "Honorable Angelina"! What does Honorable mean? Peppì! Don't start 20 questions! Mama's in a bad mood. Go on now! Have you eaten? Are you kidding? But it's 2 o'clock! - So? We don't eat here anymore, didn't you know? - Why? 'Cause there are more important things. Listen.. If they can succeed there, so can we! We have to be prepared! We must study a program! Don't we already have one? - Of course we do, and how! Here we cook up an indigestion of babble! Actually, politics is important too. Can't say no. But meanwhile we don't eat anymore. Hey, Brigadier! Have you seen my wife? How should I know among all those? Probably inside. I could eat a horse. You're telling me? I haven't even had breakfast. She had to deliver pants to half of Rome. When I woke up, nobody was there. - OK. Hey, Cesì! Cesira! What's going on inside? Brigadier, say something to your wife! I'm tired! And how can I talk to her? I'll try by mail! Cesì, are you crazy? I didn't eat all day! Leave me alone. Can't you see I'm busy? I'll fetch my cousin at her place. See ya tonight. So no dinner either, eh? Adriana, is it ready? - What? What do you mean? The food! I gotta go back to work. Tell your mom to hurry. Mom can't now, she's founding a Party. Angelì, there's the landlord! What's he doing here? Has he come to take back the flats? Go bring it inside, sweetie, Mama needs to receive the gentleman. That's her? - Yes, is it. Yes, that's her alright. I'm the one who occupied your flats. - But Ma'am.. What "Ma'am"? Don't make me sick! You come here to object 'cause four wretches like us didn't have a hole to sleep. - But, you see.. - No, you've talked too much now, you can go. Excuse me, but, I was passing by and I felt the need to meet you personally, to come and see you. Hark at that! - Why? Oh, I'm perfectly aware of the necessities that have advised you to settle the flood victims in the buildings. And I've given proof! Just ask them. I care deeply about the problems of the township. We can talk it over, if you like. We must exchange ideas, know each other better. Misunderstandings happen when there's no direct communication. Am I bothering you? Yes. Do you need anything? No. Then what are you doing here? Nothing. Just looking. - This is no place for you. Why not? One finds a lot of interesting things. Really? It must make you happy to see how poor people like us get by. Well, I wouldn't say happy. Then leave me alone, I'm busy. Each time we meet, you're mean to me. Why? No reason. I'll tell you why. We ended up here, you see? We're 8 here, plus the carriage and horses. A stable, a house, a lab, all in one. Why don't you stay at the flats? - Ah, family reasons. We'll take care of it. Are there any rooms left? Not even a square meter, Sir. - Mr. Benedetto, you've a large house. You got 3 rooms extra, I think. - I don't have that many, really. Didn't you ask me permission to sublet? Better this lady than strangers, right? Yes, but the lady has 5 kids and my wife suffers from nerves.. No, it's that we don't get along. Right, Benedetto? What does that mean? - No, she's joking. That accident.. Oh, that was a trifle! You're a woman who knows her stuff, Mrs. Angelina. I'm pleased to have met you. - Pleased? - Yes. Fillippo! Let's meet again and soon. You stay here to make arrangements. - Very well. - Goodbye, Mrs. Angelina. Goodbye. Huh? Who'd ever have said we'd come to an agreement, eh, Mr. Benedè? ANGELINA STANDS AS INDEPENDENT "WE HAVE SCABS, SO WHAT?" says Angelina. "BETTER TO HAVE THEM ON THE HEAD THAN ON THE HEART LIKE SOME." "MEN CAUSE TOO MUCH HARM" declares the Pietralata mayoress "WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT OURSELVES" ANGELINA, YOU'RE ALL OF US! HURRAH FOR THE HONORABLE ANGELINA ANGELINA, TELL US WHERE YOU'RE GOING, WE'RE WITH YOU WE WANT ANGELINA IN THE PARLIAMENT 327 votes from suburb Prenestina, 708 votes from Tormarancio. Aunt Bruna's friends? - They're 321! 11, 18, 23, 31.. I write 1, carry over 3.. 9 votes.. I write 8, carry over 4! - 85,636 votes! I'll be damned! How many votes you need to become MP? - 30,000, or even less. We can make you MP 3 times over! - 3 times, Angelì! In spite of those lousy Parties! Yeah! What we got, we got it with our own hands, right? - No, with our lungs! They all promise bread and work! - Yeah, at the elections! So you vote for them and you're screwed! - So then better act alone, Angelì! Isn't our party as good as theirs? - Come on, Angelì, we wanna try? Say yes and we'll make you Honorable right away! Angelì, take heart! Make up your mind, Angelina! - Go on! Alright! What does an Honorable do? - What do you mean? What should she do? You think they wash clothes like you? - Don't get mad! An Honorable is an Honorable, that's it! - And makes a fuss! Exactly. Makes a fuss. A fuss for us, for us personally. If you gotta say something, you can't. So you tell her. She goes to the Chamber: "Hey, you, whats-your-name, whaddya think you're doing?" Got it? You, then, get the benefits. Ain't that so? - And how! Ah, Angelì, how I envy you! There's one there that I can't stand! But I think.. you gotta know how to speak, eh? Why, ain't you got a tongue? - No, it's not that. But our Party must know how to say things, it must have a program. We'll cook it up right now. What does it take? It must be something equitable.. something.. something fair. It mustn't have the same idiocies as the others. And then.. Yes, but.. Maybe I'm not cut out for it. Be quiet, do it for Daddy. Libero! Giuseppe! Adriana! May the devil..! Come on, be good! Now Dad'll hold you, OK? Come! Don't cry, sweetie. That's it, good. Mom says not to shout. Her nerves are shot. Where's my wife? Mom says that.. in 8 minutes it'll be her turn and wants no one in the kitchen. You know how much salt to put in the pasta? I do know, but Mom doesn't want us speaking to you. Who cares about you and your mother! You no longer say hello in this house? - Oh, you there? Hi, I hadn't seen you. Ain't your mother coming? - Not now, they're making her Honorable. Dad, what are you doing? I'm having fun, can't you see? Where's Annetta? My mom says not to break anything or she'll go to the police of the lodgings. Mommy! Mommy! Who taught him that? - Probably learned by himself. - By himself, huh? Where's Annetta? Even she's busy. The other medicines for the slums came. Go on now. Beat it. Can we meet today? - No, I can't every day. - Why? - I gotta work. I know, but when you get off. - I'm afraid Mom'll notice. She won't notice. And then, if she did, there's no harm, right? Maybe there's harm. You make fun of me behind my back. I'd like to know who put that in your head. Nobody. But usually it happens when a guy like you dates a girl like me. There's nothing usual about it this time, OK? Usually a guy like me goes for a ride in his father's car. I like to work instead. A guy like me should be afraid of your mom's type, instead I like her! Usually, a guy like me doesn't go with a girl like you for a stroll to tell her lots of things, and then winds up saying nothing. Hi! - What's he saying? Don't meddle! - Will you take me for a ride? - Bug off! I'll come back at 7 for the receipt. - Alright. Whose is it? - Spartaco lent it to me. Not true! He bought it! I saw him give him the money. You shut up! - Who gave you money? I didn't buy it, I gave a down payment! - Aw, come on! Hey, we must come to an understanding, OK? We tell everything or nothing. You too, shut up or no more bike rides, got it? Dad's been calling us for ages. - It's good for the voice. He's hung up on calling! I think the first point is that everybody should eat and well. - Right. Secondly, we should sleep like Christians. Third point, divorce! Fourth point.. You gotta sign for the medicines. And then Dad would like.. Yeah, I know what he wants. - Angelì, once in the Chamber, you need to make a law forbidding men from talking from 12 to 2. And from 2 to 12 next day, only we can talk. - Yep.. But I say instead of talking so much, it'd be time to mind our things, right? The first sensible thing to do is to free those buildings. - What? Are you joking? - No, I'm serious. Wanna let that scum win? - He's not scum, he's a good man. Did you see? Today too he sent us medicines, as the others weren't enough. We're there and there we'll stay! We shouldn't talk like that. Else, we'll start bullying just like all the others. We must do what's right. Mr. Callisto made me see yesterday. Angelì, you're not getting fooled, eh? Am I some wimp, eh? - No, just saying.. I mean, now that the flooding is over, we can't prevent the work, right? That poor guy'll go bankrupt going on like that, I tell ya. - Too bad for him. And if he's bankrupt, who'll give jobs to the workers? What if he don't and won't give 'em back? He'll give those flats back. He'll put in writing that he won't oppose us going in again. That'd be something! I'd have made a fuss for nothing? OK, but who'll make the men move out? - Oh, that's easy! - Easy to say! Well then, we'll go on strike. If we strike.. In what sense? - In all senses! Let 'em go without buttons, no food.. They won't last 2 days, I bet! If I strike for two days. my husband won't resist. But only if your responsible, Angelì, because I don't trust capitalists. I've a nose for people, I'm never wrong. Mr. Callisto is a good person. He's a worker like us. May I drop dead if I'm wrong. Look, I take full responsibility, all! Angelina! Angelì! Dinner is ready. Hurry up, I gotta get the house ready! Is it my fault? She even bullies, as if I was the one who wants to leave! Come on, let's go, it's late! - We were so fine there! I'm going crazy! I can't find my shoes! Where are my shoes? Can you button me up? - You gotta be kidding! Here's one! Where's the other? - Giuseppe played with it. - You did? Mom said that's not the way.. - Tell your mom to cut it out! We'll be gone tomorrow, so say bye to her! Come on, get up, walk with that kid! Always with the paper, eh? Can I go out with one shoe, hmmm? - I found it at last, Angelì! Thank God! - Angelì, we got some clothes. This is Mrs. Amalia's, want to try it on? What time is it? - Probably 9. It's time for them to eat. Peppì, go see what your dad is doing! Angelì, we brought you this hat! - It's Assunta's. She bought it without her husband knowing and never wore it. Try it on! Not the hat! - Go on, try it on! Look how cute I look! You'll knock 'em dead! - Aren't you eating at Mr. Callisto's? Eating? It's a reception. There'll be important people. There'll be coffee and conversation. It's elegant people.. they eat on the sly. Tonight you'll enter high society. You'll be important! - Isn't she already? You'll make a career of it! You just need to blabber on the radio! Angelì, I have something that my mama gave me. It's all gold. Wear it tonight and give it back to me tomorrow. Thank you, Mrs. Cesì. I thank you all.. for all this attention, but.. You see.. I prefer to go as I am, with my own clothes, without any elegance. Because when one's clean, one can go anywhere, don't you think? But this hat is so nice! No, no.. listen to me, no. Do as you please, but don't let them snow you. Make sure we get back in those flats! - Mrs. Carmè, in writing. Why the doubt? You think people with villas, salons, cars want to fool poor folk like us? No. I'm just saying, 'cause my husband is furious! - Tell him to cool it! - Not easy! Oh, at last! You made it, finally! Goodbye, goodbye. We've bothered you at dinner time. - Oh, it was just a minute. Goodbye. See you at the meeting tomorrow. - I'll warn you through Giuseppe. I'm forgetting one thing: glasses. You must at least accept these. Glasses? - We put up a collection. Just in case.. If you have to read anything there, with glasses you'll see better, right? For sure I'll accept these. You've all been so nice. Thank you. Thanks a lot. - What for? We wrote it on the walls: "Angelì, you're all of us!" Oh, my! - I'd say to look again at the pamphlet, there are some words.. - Cesì, trust me! Careful, Angelì! We're in your hands! - Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Mama Mia, what a day! And it's not yet over! Hurry, we're late. Just a little, for me. Yuck! What's this? Glue? You call this pasta? - Why, am I a chef? Don't be funny! Don't answer like a spiteful kid! You gotta be careful! That's enough! What now? - I've had enough! I don't wanna be careful! I'm a Vice-Brigadier! And I'm sick of this life! You'll end up having me fired! Big deal! What about mom becoming an Honorable? You, shut up. - No, let him talk, he's right. I needs worry about your problems when I have so much to worry about tonight? Oh, right: politics! You make me laugh with that farce! - So mine is a farce? While you did serious politics, right? - I never did politics! Damn, you have such a nerve! Hey, amnesiac, you don't remember? When you did the Demographic Program at my expense? When you were forced to get 9 kids? And if July 25th hadn't come, I'd still be churning out wretches like a dispenser! If you didn't have lots of kids, you couldn't get ahead! You couldn't get a pay advance or the birth bonus! No career at all! Knock it off, beat it! Cut it out, Angelina! - No way! You know what you are? A killjoy! Get that idea out of your head! - No, I won't! You should be happy your wife has a career! You'll see the Chamber with a broken head! - You gonna do what? You like to see me dressed like a beggar. Angelì, don't provoke me! - Don't touch me! I know him! Not only is he capable of arresting his wife, but he would send his kids to the electric chair! Well said, Angelì! Make yourself heard! - Men must stop with their bullying! We too have the vote now! Enough! You saw that? He wants to shame me in public! In public! Only for the pleasure of making me spend a bad evening! Where is it? Where's my gun belt? Papa! - Oh, God, Pasquà! What's he up to? Don't tell him! What're you going to do, Pasquà! - Calm down, Dad! Uncle Joe's gotta come! General, you gotta stop mistreating that poor thing! We all love her. - You gotta knock it off. Leave me alone.. - You gotta cut it out. Just a sec, we're coming! We're ready! - OK. Good evening, Luigi. - Hi, Pasquà. Anything new? New? Everything is new. Still? Good evening. Say hello. Adriana, change the baby, he pooed himself! Shall we go? Thank you. Go on, get in. Thank you. Angelina! Don't forget! Have some fun! - Goodbye! I realized I'm of no use. One of these days I'll leave home. - Come on, that's just talk! Who knows! You see, Luigi, once I had the comfort after working the whole day for pennies, after undergoing so many humiliations, once home, they'd be waiting for me with those eyes.. "Papa, what did you bring to eat?" I felt important, I admit. It gave me a sense of responsibility. Now.. no one is waiting for me. I don't get along with her anymore. Her head has turned. They turned her head. I don't count anymore in my home. My kids don't listen to me. I've lost them too. They only see their mother, and they're right. Course, she's got writings on walls! And pants, receptions, papers, Parties.. If you take from a poor guy his kids' respect, what's he left with? There's so few things in life.. One moment, OK? Allow me, Ma'am. Huh? - Your coat. No, no matter, I'll keep it. Give him yours. Say! Either I'm dumb or you didn't have those earrings at home? - Dina lent them. Who? Dina from the store. - Go on, take 'em off. You wouldn't dare at home but you do here? Crazy? Shall we go? - Sure. Take them off! Oh, here you are! Finally you've come! - Good evening! Excuse me for being late, but I had a family discussion. Same old politics? - Sort of: internal politics! Dear, this is the famous Angelina. - Ah, I've heard so much about you! This is Annetta, mom. - Cute! Congratulations, Angelina, you've a lovely girl! - Thank you! - For what? Oh, they're so beautiful. Giacomo! Shall we go into the salon? - We need to have a nice chitchat, you and I. Mind you, I won't join any Party! Mine is enough! Then, maybe, I might join yours. - That's it, that's a good idea! Excuse me, Ma'am, I'll see you later. - Of course, take your time. Good evening! - Hello! Thank you, darling, for being here! - Hi! So we're having a proletarian evening. Caviar? Vodka? We must keep up to date, if we want to stay in fashion! What is this Angelina like? - So-so. Trouble is, she has a daughter, and Filippo buzzes buzzes about. - No! Ah, what a world! Lucky you, who have no children! I'm happy to meet Angelina. You spoke to her yet? - Not yet, but I have good news. They left the flats today. - No! At 9, they were deserted. - Wow! How did you manage it? Trade secret. - You're not a man, you're a demon! Light a candle to the Madonna! - It's done, friend. Oh! Look who's here! Filippo! Good evening. - Good evening, ma'am. - Hi! - Hi! What a romantic air! - They say you've disappeared from circulation. I smell a rat, eh? - After I graduated dad made me work. Ah, these dads! Thank you, tovarisch. Let's go. - Excuse me. Excuse me a moment. - Please. How nice! So you're an Honorable? - Yes. Are you amazed? Not on your life. You too? - Certainly. - I'm one too. And you? - Not yet. - Soon, I bet. - Hopefully. Holy smoke! Everywhere you look we're all Honorables! Tell me, how do you feel being an Honorable? Truly, Ma'am I wouldn't know. - I'd like to know your agenda. It must be very interesting. - Mine? Well, look, when it's ready I'll send each of you a copy so you can learn it by heart! Having fun? - Yes. Then what's wrong? You don't like the party? It took this party to make me realize something is wrong. What's wrong? - Everything. My mother, me, among all these people, dressed like this.. I feel so ridiculous. - Annetta, I'm the one who's ashamed to have friends who judge people by how they dress and how much they earn. There's not one among them as good and nice as you. You think I don't see that? So then, be cheerful! I'm glad to see my dad so nice to you and your mom. I'm sure.. that he too has understood many things. So what do you think of these capitalistic pigs, eh? May I be frank? - Please do! They're.. they're kinda heavy. But you're very nice. To think I couldn't stand you, at first. I told you, we need to know each other, and the misunderstandings disappear. Come with me so we can be alone. I've something very important to tell. To me? - Yes. Come! You're not trying to seduce me, eh? - Well, who knows? In a sense.. You must've realized that I really like you. You're a practical, smart woman. You speak when you must and keep quiet when you have to. Have a seat, please. Am I wrong? - Eh, I won't say no. In a way, yes. Well then, since smart people need to help each other, I thought of making you a small present. For me? - No! Not for you. For your Party. To meet your needs in case you were in some difficulty. This is a million.. But that's only if the difficulty isn't serious.. Otherwise, I'm always ready to increase it. What am I supposed to do with this? - Anything you want, Angelina, anything. As you see, I put your name just for that reason. You never know, sometimes, how your friends might take it.. What should they take? It might cause some disappointment since they got accustomed to the new flats. But then you mean that those people.. will never go back to the flats! My dear madam, tomorrow I'll no longer be the owner, and my promises won't have any value. You lousy wretch! - Mrs. Angelina, what's wrong now? It was no use having been one like us? Obviously when you make money you think differently, eh? - Callisto! What happened? - What happened? I'm only sorry I can't express myself, 'cause I'd like to tell you, the disgust.. The disgust I feel now to be among such people! Mom, we're in their house! - Some house it is! They gave us charity! Charity with coffee! You see the favor they did us? They gave charity out of their courtesy! All of them! Here they are: look at them! Look at them! They're all experts in charity! But it won't work! Sorry, we can't accept! This time don't break out, because I'll reoccupy the flats, even if I should fight against all the police! Let's go! Crying? Why cry? It's me who should cry for being mixed up with these people! Get your coat! Filippo! Such people! How shameful! - You can't say she minces her words! Annetta! - Filippo, where are you going? Wasn't all that enough? But Mom! - Don't mom me! Come! Hello? Police? This is Commendatore Garrone speaking. Yes, I'm the owner of the flats being built in Pietralata. Yes, those are the ones. Commissioner, here we go again! The distinguished Mrs. Angelina, whom you well know, has just left here a minute ago threatening to incite the slum dwellers to reoccupy the flats! Well, because I wasn't in agreement with her on certain things. Well, not exactly that but something close to it. Thank you, Sir, you’re very kind. It's done! This time Angelina will calm down! What do you mean? - What I said, my son! She'll forget her revolutionary ideas, once and for all! Don't worry, the contract isn't at risk. The police will watch over the flats to avoid troubles. Mrs. Angelina will think twice! She'll break her bones against the police! You think you're doing right, Dad? - What's with you? What's happening? What's going on? Never mind, Angelì, now ain't the time. No more bull! - Why? What do you mean "why"? You think we're idiots? You come from his house and you don't know the cops guard the flats? And my husband hit me! The wretch had them occupied? - Stop the playacting! If you wanna marry your girl to the young lord, don't go slumming, OK? The young lord? - Angelì, you want us to believe that your eyes don't see? We all saw your daughter with Callisto's son! They went dancing where the sheriff's son works! Where a soda costs 500 lire! What's this all about? - Now you pay for the soda with your services! And you even hope he'll marry her, eh? Here comes the other one! Good one! Same breed! You here already? What's happening? - What's happening.. is that I give you no more credit! Meanwhile I'll take the bike back until you pay me the next installments! Get off! - Wait! Isn't this your friend's? A friend? Of course! You don't know where the medicine wound up! Ask your son! What's this story? Explain yourself! - Explain what? Explain what? The trouble is I only found out tonight, otherwise I'd never give him the bike! I don't play games! Not me! Let's go! Let me through! Now you know why the medicine was never enough, eh? Good night! You've taken care of your whole family with Callisto! - Well done, Angelina! Angelì! Cat got your tongue, eh? What can she say? She's all set with those kids! And then in that cuckold's house she got everything she needs. And we remain here in the sewer! Now you can do our pants for free! We've earned it! An Honorable, alright! To the Ministry of Ripping Off the Poor! - Mom.. I'll deal with you later. Come here, you. Come here. What have you done? - Mama! What have you done? What have you done? Whatcha doing? - Where ya goin', traitor? Your house is on the other side! - Where's she going? To play the big shot at the flats! - Cut it out, Angelina! You dare tell us you acted on our behalf? Angelina, you're worse than that bastard, Callisto! Watch out, they've machine guns! - They shoot for real! Forget it! Nobody's gonna follow you! Who knows what she's got in mind? - Forget it, let's see where she's going! Haven't you done enough? This fanatic fool! You took care of your business, eh? Stop, Mom! What are you doing? - Go back, Mama! Stop! Don't come any closer! Stop! Go back home! Don't force us to do anything foolish! Go back! - No! Angelina! Go back, Angelina! Think of the kids! Go back! - No! GO BACK! Are you crazy? - Let me go! You can't lead the people against the Police! Go home! I don't care! I don't care! I'll never stop! NEVER! POPULAR LADY MAYOR OF PIETRALATA ARRESTED IS ANGELINA A COMMON BLACKMAILER? THE END OF THE SUPPOSED BENEFACTRESS'S POPULARITY PIETRALATA WOMEN REJECT THEIR MAYORESS ANGELINA WANTED TO PROFIT FROM LANDLORD GARRONE'S FLATS PIETRALATA WOMEN REJECT THEIR MAYORESS That's a nice way to behave! You've a paper and you won't let your friends read it! Why should you care? It's the same one from 3 weeks ago. Can't you get any with pictures? Cinema magazines, comics? The other jail was the same: you could never get a decent newspaper. So you'd be the Mayoress of Pietralata? Some career you've made! Stop annoying people! Beat it! But, say.. You haven't heard anything? Who knows how long they'll keep me here. Believe me, they can't give you more than 3 years. I even asked Maria's lawyer. 3 years.. Don't feel bad. They'll pass quickly. I don't feel bad. I wish it were 10, or forever. This way I won't screw up anymore. I feel sorry only for the kids. - It's done.. Yeah, right. It's done. I should've thought of them before. One should always think of them before. I've also ruined my poor husband. Surely, family is a great thing. One should take great care of it. Are you married too? My dear lady, only in a certain sense. My husband.. I killed him. And if something happened to him? It's not possible that for such nonsense he'd leave the house. It's been 2 weeks. Nothing happened, don't worry, keep calm! You never tell me how things stand. As if I were an idiot. Am I right? The accountant is here. Shall he wait? - No, show him in. - Right away. This way, please. May I? Well, how did it go? - So-so. We spoke for an hour. Of course, he realizes he went too far. But he said not to worry about him. - But what's he doing? He's working as a draftsman for the architect Boggiani. He says he needs nothing. - Right! I'd like to see how he'll ski this winter! Have a seat. - Thanks. You see, Ma'am, I doubt he's interested in skiing. Excuse me, Commendatore, but that boy is certainly yours. And if he gets something in his head.. - Like what? I want to know. That little witch is behind it all. If he wants to marry that little worthless girl, let him have her! There'll be time enough to split up! - I confess I don't understand it.. First he says he doesn't want to hurt you because he loves you. Then he says he can't remain indifferent to some dirty tricks.. Pardon me, Sir.. like sending a mother of 5 children to jail, only guilty of wanting to prevent the success of a bad affair. He's says he'll write and visit you, but he wants to make his own living. Sorry, Sir, more than this I couldn't do. - Thank you, accountant. You know how much affection I feel for the boy.. and for you. I'll see you later at the office. - Alright, Sir. Goodbye, Ma'am. - Bye. Who's Angela Bianchi? Me. I have a visitor? No, it's not visiting day. My daughter, get your things and come with me. What's happening? - Probably transferring you for the trial. Let's go. Have courage and don't worry. Bye and good luck! Let's hope it's nothing. - Bye. Come in. Come here. Your release order has arrived. - What? Yes, you're free. Commendatore Garrone has taken back the allegation. Are you sure? Because.. it's the second time that he's had me released after sending me to jail. I'd like to know if he likes to see me go in and out. So I can adjust, next time. It seems it was an unfortunate misunderstanding. You are truly free, now. Thanks a lot. Bye. WOMEN'S PRISON Are you here to send me back in again? - No, to tell you you're still our Angelina. Oh, now? - Angelina, they're waiting for you at the flats. The flats? You don't know that when Callisto put you in jail, his son left home in protest. Come along, we got the truck. We've been jerks, Angelì! While you went to jail to give us the flats, we were treating you so badly. Come on, let's go. What's happening? Arianna! Get down here! Where must we go? To the new buildings! They're assigning the flats! Come down! Are you kidding? - You're booked, in a month you move in. Peppino, come down! Bring your dad! How much? - About same as here. What's going on? Come, Angelì, Roberto is waiting for you! He's in the shack! He wants to talk! What? - They're signing to assign the flats! You've done it! Good job! How happy I am! See the welcome they're giving you? You know, I left the flat with green tiles for you. The loveliest of all! It's on the first floor, Angelì! Pasquale.. Officer! Are you here to arrest her again? No. MPs enjoy parliamentary immunity. What are you saying? Because.. this time they'll make you an Honorable for real. Did you come to tell me that? - No. I came here by chance. You're a smart lady. - Pasquà, what's got into you now? Nothing. It's just that.. - Angelina, come here! I'll be there in a sec! Pasquà, we'll talk later, OK? Yes, later. Goodbye, Honorable. Come on, don't make fun, please. Wait here, don't move. - Angelì, come on! - Yes. - I'm coming. Sign here, Angelina. Right here. Where are you going? Angelina, what is it? You're in love again? Why? - You look at your husband like a girl. Pasquà! Aren't you going to hear your wife's speech? She's going to make a speech? - You bet! If not today, when? Let's go! No, no. I've got to get back to HQ. And I'll even stay there. - Really? I've decided. She's settled now anyway. For what I can do.. I'll ask for a transfer. I'll give my wages to the kids. You understand me, don't you, Luìgi? Yeah, I understand. Luigi, I don't feel like living life as before. Tell her, so that she understands. I can't sacrifice myself, or be brought down. Sure, don't worry, I'll tell her. Bye, Luì, you're truly a friend. - Goodbye. The flat is yours. Done. Angelì, get busy now! - You must compete in the elections. Make a speech! - Why? - Everybody's expecting a speech. I'm no good with speeches. Have you seen Pasquà? - That's why I came. - Where is he? Angelì, it's a long story. Honorable, don't let us down! - I told him not to move! Come on, just say something. Anything! I don't know how to make speeches! Go on, Mom, we're here too! - What Mom? Go on, Honorable! It's too hard.. I don't know what to say. I have only one thing to tell you: I think I'll never be an Honorable. We'll make you! - 86,000 votes! They're no good. I'm not up to it. You see, while I was in jail I thought a lot. The government should force people to do some jail. Like military service. That's right. Partly, because we all deserve it, at least a little, and partly because in there your mind clears up. So, in there, I realized I'm just one like you, one who tries to put together dinner with lunch, fights with broken windows, humidity, all the troubles you know better than me. And even if, as you say, thanks to me we have houses we'd never dreamed of having, I see that this isn't the way to become an Honorable. As far as I'm concerned, then, I realized that by doing politics, my family was falling apart. And I care a lot for my kids. I want to raise them as they ought to be. Besides, without being an Honorable, I've enough politics at home. Husband, troubles, kids.. Arguments such, that the Chamber can only dream of. I am sure.. that you won't regret if I leave the post to one better, more prepared than me. Someone who could really help you. Someone more calm and organized, who won't let himself be fooled. Therefore.. therefore I say goodbye. I salute you. But if you call me to make some noise, I'll always be ready, 'cause that's the one thing that comes natural to me. This way our Party won't break up, but it won't go to the Parliament either. It'll stay among us, we'll argue as a family, so we'll all be Honorables. Honorables for real, though. You must help me, Marshal. You must support my request. I told you everything. Where are you? What're you doing here? What are.. But.. What's this about? - Hasn't Luigi told you? Yeah, he told me. That's why I'm here. Don't be stupid, come on! Excuse me, Marshal. Be my guest. Well? Why are you crying now? You should be happy. Everybody loves you. Soon you'll be an Honorable. An Honorable, me? You don't understand anything. I made a nice speech and I resigned. You resigned? - Yes, I just want to be Angelina. Yeah, she acted like an idiot! How dare you talk that way to your mom? - Shut your trap! Hey, boy, you forgot to respect your father, right? We had all forgotten. Well, from now on, we'll remember! Right, Marshal? - If you say so, Ma'am. I'm right, and how! So, we understand one another? Remember, from today you're warned.. - Angelì! You'd better hush, I'll deal with it. Bye, Marshal. Excuse us, see you soon. Give him here! Damn, you always make him cry! Let's go. Bye, Marshal, thanks a lot. Hold this. Where are we going? Where can we go, now? Got money for the movies? - No. Let's go home then. Are you asleep? I wish! Why aren't you asleep? I want to do the accounts first. Do them tomorrow. If I don't do them I can't sleep. - Smart gal! So, when you've done 'em, you won't sleep for real. You? Why aren't you sleeping? I'm thinking. - About what? Everything was about to be ruined, and yet, we love each other. That's why you don't sleep? Pasquà, it's all over, right? You'll see that everything will be fine. Libero will be brought to order.. in a month we'll have blue tiles. This is serious: I just don't get it. Two people love each other, and yet.. - Pasquà, you're talking like a kid now? There are more serious things. Like money for the kids' milk tomorrow. Won't get it without the voucher. I can ask for another advance. But it'll still take a couple of days. How will you get by? - Don't worry about that. Leave the milkman to me. Tomorrow, I'll go to that jerk and give him a piece of my mind! English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
