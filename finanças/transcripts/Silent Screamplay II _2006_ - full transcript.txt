Brandon, what is it Honey? I just had the worst dream. It’s OK. Go back to Sleep. It was only Dream. Oh Crap! I’m sorry. Are you OK? I’m fine. I don’t think my eggs are though. I’m really sorry. I should have been watching where I was going. Let me help you with this. No. No. I wasn’t watching either. Um. I’m Lyle. I’m just moving into apartment four. Elizabeth’s Place… Already? I just thought for sure that would be empty for a while. Um. You know I was kind of in a rush I guess but I, I just got into town and really needed a place quick. So I got into the car. I started driving around. I got here and I fell in love with the place. Um... I asked the manager and he said it was ready to move into. Wait a minute. Who did you talk to? The manager. I think he said his name was Brian or Brendon. Brandon? Brandon. Yeah. Nice Guy. I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. I'm Heather. Hi Heather. Hi. It looks like we’re neighbors. Wait... You live with Brandon? Are you guys… Oh wow. How funny. I didn’t realize. I must look like such a Dork. Yeah I, I talked to the manager. I’II see ya later. Bye. Hi. Is this Mr. Kennedy’s Office? This is Mr. Quan’s office. Mr. Kennedy works for us now. Please have a seat. So that’s a ten thousand dollar retainer in my office end of business day. I’m looking forward to winning your case. Sweet Jesus I couldn’t get him off the phone. So how’s it going Brandon? I’m good. Just got married. And you are? Joe Alexander. Mr. Kennedy is no longer with us. Mrs. Webb. Lunch time. I’II be back in an hour. What do you mean he’s no longer with us? I’m mean he’s no longer with us. I’II get right to the point. We need that property Brandon. You were sent to Hawaii to take care of Heather, not to marry her. Don't threaten me Mr. Alexander. She's my wife now and I will protect her. I know where you’re coming from and I respect that. But we got a job to do. What I’m trying to tell you is that we’re going to do that job with you or without you. So if you’re smart, you’II do everything you can to convince her to sell the place. Mr. Quan made her a very generous offer. You just make sure she takes it. I’II keep that in mind. Hello. Hello, is the manager there? Yes. This is Heather. Uh.. I was looking for Brandon. No. Brandon is not here right now. Can I help you? Oh Brandon’s not there. Uh. This is Lyle in apartment four. Right. Hi Lyle. We met this afternoon. Yeah that’s right. How are you? Look, I’m fine. How can I... What can I do for you? Uh. OK. I guess I could ask you. Um there seems to be a problem with my window here in the bedroom. Um. I think it's painted shut or something Do you think you could fix it? Sure. Sure. I’II tell Brandon as soon as he gets home. We’II take care of it. We’II fix it. That’s great. I really appreciate it, Heather. Thank you for helping me out with this. It really means a lot. Ok. Lyle. Ok see ya. Brandon! Hi Honey. Something sure smells good over here. I made chicken and you’re going to love it. Am I? Yes. I’m going to pour some wine. OK. Mmmm. Brandon. Why did you rent Elizabeth’s apartment without telling me? What's the problem? Nothing. I just... I didn’t know anything about it. I met him today. Who? Lyle. The guy who took the apartment. Nice guy huh? I guess. Actually, he was kind of creepy. He reminds me of Michael. Really. I didn’t get that. Maybe it was just me. Oh. He called today. His window’s stuck. He wants you to fix it. I’II put that on your honey do list. I’II fix it tomorrow. Mmmm. This chicken is really good. Congratulations. Thank you. Let’s see here. Parris. Burns. From the Captain. Thank you Rodgers. Have fun fellows. What you too? Guess I got to cancel my Pilates class. Congratulations. Thank You. Red Wine? My favorite. Mine too. So how was Hawaii? Hawaii. It’s an amazing place to Honeymoon. You never should have married her Brandon. Her father’s murder investigation is still open. You’re in way over your head. I fell in love. Convenient. Three million dollars buys a lot of love, Brandon. Thanks for the wine, Marks. You’re welcome. If you’II excuse me. Hello. Hey, it’s me. Brandon, the power just went out here. Really! Did you try the other rooms? No. But the TV and the lamp won’t work. It happens all the time in the summer. Rolling black outs and all. The Ghost of Grey Davis lives on. It came back on. The power is back on. See. It’s no big deal. Thank you, Roger. Oh Crap. What? I have to work stake out tonight and break in a new Rookie. Awh. That’s too bad. I rented a movie and everything. I know. Look. Why don’t you take the night off for yourself. Take a long hot bath. Pamper yourself a little bit. OK. I’m not going to home till after midnight. So don’t wait up. We’II watch the movie tomorrow night. OK? Well, get home as soon as you can. OK? I will. OK. I love you. Bye. Hello, is anyone down there? Hello? Lyle are you here? Lyle? Jesus Lyle. Why didn’t you answer me? I’m sorry. I couldn’t hear you. I found this tape player and put it on to listen. I guess I had it cranked too loud. What are you doing down here anyway? Oh. I came down looking for a spare light bulb for my porch light. It’s out. Why don't you just ask us to fix it? I know. I didn’t want to bother you guys. It’s really no big deal. Whose place is this anyway? This is the old Gardener’s quarters. Really. I like what he did to it. Well, he hasn’t been here for a while. He used to stalk the tenants here. He used to spy on us. Take pictures. The Gardener huh. I guess after a while you run out of weeds to whack. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I... That’s OK. That’s OK. In the future, Lyle, if you have a problem with your light bulb, you either ask Brandon or myself to fix it. OK? Now let’s get out of here. This place gives me the creeps. What? Listen Right. Oil prices go up. Who makes the money. Who you think makes the money. Who. Bush man. Bush. Bush and all his cronies out there. You know where it goes? Right here. I can’t hear a thing, West. Let see. That’s impossible. Wait. Right there. Don’t touch anything. Volume is on the right. To the right. OK that makes sense. Rook Rook Rook don’t touch anything. You’re just here to learn right. Awh. Come on man. Burns! Mmmmm. Burns! Are you with us? This is bull! You got something on your mind, Rook? We’ve been sitting here five hours watching some white lady cook soggy noodles. Welcome to the squad. Tell you what, Myles. It's Nyles. Right. Come here. Something is telling me you got a problem working surveillance. Sir. I just… ..What can we do for you to make it a more comfortable environment here? How about another slice of pizza. I’m terribly sorry we forgot your seat cushion today. How about a freaking couch. Sir, I just want some action. Get the hell out of my sight, Rookie. Go get us some more coffee. A little cream and sugar in mine please. What kind of attitude is that? What is that? You know the Rookie is right. We’re sitting here babysitting this broad. I bet she makes more money than all three of us combined. I got some day old Danishes too. Apricot, Cheese and Prune. That’s for you, Parris. Parris. Guys. Come on. The dead have arisen. Burns, why don’t you grab some coffee and get out of here. We can take care of it from here. No thanks. I’m fine. You can’t even keep your eyes open. I’m fine. Bring me some coffee please. Oh shit. Not again. Awwh! Heather! Heather! Parris. Are you going to be OK? Who could have done this? Why don’t you take me through it again. What happened? Like I told you. I came home late last night from the Holyfield surveillance. Um Hmm. I went to the bathroom to wash up. I didn’t see the water on the floor. I slipped. I hit my head and passed out. Then when I woke up this morning, I found her like that. Just like Elizabeth. And the tongue? I never saw it. What about the note. The note? I didn’t see the note until you got here. What do you think it means? No new tale to tell? I don’t know. Maybe... …hold on for a second. We’re just about done here. Yeah. But I got to tell you. This looks a lot like the other one. Yeah. Pretty much. The posing of the body. Tongue gone. What about him? Well, he’s understandably upset. I'll bring him in later. You know we are going to have to interview him. I know. Just give me some time. OK? OK. You got it. Thanks! OK. Burns. Let’s go through it again. You come home from surveillance. You didn’t hear or see Heather at that point. Like I said. It was late. I was just going to wash up and join her in bed. But instead. You passed out in the bathroom. Look I don’t need this crap from you, Parris. I didn’t see the puddle. I didn’t see the puddle. Like you didn’t see the tongue on the counter. It was two o'clock in the morning. I was exhausted. You saw me. I couldn’t even see straight. There was a puddle of water on the floor. I slipped. I hit my head the sink. Period! He’s all yours, Marks. Listen Brandon. I know the tongue was in the medicine cabinet to begin with. I know it just didn't magically appear on the counter. Now since I was the first person in the bathroom, I was able to wipe the bag clean. So that no one will know that you touched it. No prints are on it. I want to help you, Brandon. But you need to be straight with me. What can you remember about this morning? OK. I came into the bathroom and I didn't see the blood in the tub at first. I went to the medicine cabinet. I was reaching for my toothbrush and that's when I saw the bag. I freaked out! And then I saw all the blood. I got scared. I thought something happened to Heather. So I ran to check on her and I slipped on the puddle. I hit my head. I passed out. Look all that I know is….. All I know... is that when I woke up, I had the worst headache. I don't know if I dreamt the whole thing... until... until I went to the bed. And I found her. It’s OK. Listen. Captain is giving you a week off. I want you to try and get some rest. Parris and I will do everything that we can. We're going to catch this guy, Brandon. I promise. Get Mr. Alexander out here NOW! Mr. ALEXANDER! Did you really think I'd let you get away this! What the hell are you talking about? Shut the FUCK UP! you know exactly what I'm talking about and so does Mr. Quan. I don't know what you're talking about. I swear... …BULLSHIT you know… ..Just hold on.. ..You KILLED HER.. Heather was killed?.. When? Last night. When I was working surveillance. And everybody thinks that I did it. Look Brandon. I'm telling you the truth. I swear I had nothing to do with it. I was still giving you a chance to fix things before I try anything. If you didn’t kill her, and I didn't kill her, then who the Fuck did? I don’t know. Who is it? Who is it? Can I help you? Hi. My name is Pamela Martin. My sister Samantha use to live upstairs in apartment number five. She was the one shot by the police. I remember her. Would you like to come in? Sure. Sorry about the mess. Can I offer you a drink? Some coffee something like that? No, thank you. I'm fine. Please have a seat. Thanks. So how can I help you? I was wondering if her apartment was available to rent. Who’s? Sammy's. I'd really like to take over the lease if possible. You want to take it over. It's $1800 a month. No problem. I would like to move in as soon as possible. If that's OK. That's OK. Sure. I'll get the key. It's going to be first months, last months. Half of that for Security. Your total is $4500. I’II take a check. Here’s the keys. Its number five upstairs. You can just let yourself in. Who do I make the check out to? Heather Burns Here you go. Thanks. Great. I caught em. Oh. Thanks. Don’t worry. I live here too. I’m Lyle. I live downstairs. Oh. I’m Pammy. I just moved in. Nice to meet you Pammy. Why don’t you let me carry these for you into your place? Awh. That’s Ok I can manage. Awh. Come on. I got nothing going on. Uh. Well… Thank you. Oh. You can just put those down here. Is something wrong? Oh. No. Nothing. It's just that um... Forgive me. This is the apartment where that woman... Yeah. She's my sister. Really? Gosh I'm sorry. Thanks. And now you're living here? Yeah. I thought it would help me. You know get over it. Adjust to her death. That’s heavy. Were you a philosophy major in college? No wait. Psych right? No. Actually I didn’t finish college. Right. Home Schooled. I totally dig that. Um. Thank you for helping me carry these up. I really appreciate it. It's Lyle right? Right. No problem at all. You know I would have to need a... drink or something but I really didn’t have time to go shopping yet. I'll take a raincheck. So. Anyway, about your sister, um... the cops know anything? I don't know. The only thing that I know is that they're accusing her of killing some woman in this complex. Yeah. Elizabeth. I live in her place now. So did your sister ever seem to have it in her? No. I mean. I don’t know what happened here, but that’s what I want to find out. Weird huh? And then this thing yesterday with the manager. What thing? You didn’t hear? Heather. Brandon’s wife down stairs. She was murdered yesterday. What? Oh my gosh. Are you serious? He just had me write a check out to her yesterday. Yeah. He was working late and someone came in and slit her throat. Oh my god. That's horrible. He didn't even mention anything to me about that. And there I was, making him sign over a new lease to me. How insensitive. Uh. Don't feel too bad. He's a cop you know. They tend to develop a pretty thick skin. That was his wife. I mean how devastating. Yeah, but they were only recently married and... I don’t know… It’s still tough I guess. Well... for what it's worth, welcome to the building. Thanks. You know I am really worn out from moving just everything. So... I think I'm gonna take a shower and relax. So if you don't mind. Oh sure. Um listen. Here's my number. Don't hesitate to call if you need anything and I mean anything. OK, Lyle. I'll keep that in mind. Thanks. Bye. Hello. Brandon. Hello. Hey! Hi! Uh I was just about to uh have a glass of wine and though maybe you’d like to join me. I’II get an opener. Come on in. Make yourself at home. OK. So when her father got murdered, she came out here to claim the building. My partner, Detective Marks, and I interviewed her and that's how we met. So did you ever find out who killed her father? Um mh. It's still under investigation. My personal hunch... it was the gardener. He used to um stalk the tenants. He had his own set of master keys. He even took pictures of Heather while she was sleeping. Oh my gosh. Tell me about it. We got him for the stalking, peeping tom, breaking and entering. But there wasn't enough physical evidence that ever tie him to the murders. He only got six months in a halfway house. How's that for justice. So he couldn't have been the one that killed Heather. Oh. I'm sorry. I know how painful this is. Believe me. I really miss my sister too That didn’t take long. [Hi Lyle. It's Pammy. Listen. To whom it may concern. I examined Samantha Martin. Excellent physical health. Recommended for travel. Doctors note. Where’s she going? Drop off Bran's badge on the way. Bran? Brandon. Sammy, you and Brandon Burns doing it. Wait a minute. No way. She didn't do it. He did. Holy crap! You scared the crap out of me! Literally. I think. I have a work order for Pam Martin. Oh. Yes. Right this way. 16 homicide. Yeah. Is this the officer that's investigating the murders at 9379 Olympia Heights? Yes. Hi. My name is Lyle Chagnon. I just moved into the complex. I live in Apartment four. Where that older woman was killed. They've already rented that place out? Yeah. Well I was in a rush looking for a place and I talked to the manager into letting me have it. Well, I guess if it doesn't bother you. No. I'm OK. Thanks for wondering. Most people just don't take the time to listen you know. Is there something I can do for you, Mr. Chagnon? Huh. Oh. Yeah. Well... I'm in Mrs. Martin's apartment and I found... ...You're where? In Mrs. Martin’s apartment. Apartment five. What are you doing in her apartment? Um. Letting in the Cable Guy. It's a neighbor thing. As you were saying. Yeah. So I'm her apartment and I found a note that the other Mrs. Martin wrote. You know. The one that was shot. Yes, I remember . I, you know. I really think I should come in and talk to you about this in person. Are you sure, sir? We've already gone all this way. No. Yep. Yep. I'll be in four o'clock tomorrow afternoon. OK sir. Come on in. Hi! Hey. Hey. Hi. We’re all set. If you have any questions, the number’s at the bottom of the page. OK. Great. Thank you. I’d best be going too. I’II see you later. OK. Hey. I want to talk to you about getting cable. Weasel! What's wrong? Well that little Jack Off that called me yesterday and wanted to set up an appointment to meet with me. Stood me up. Now I’m going to go over to the West Side and drop this off at Bruebakers. And on the way back, I might just have to stop in and see that little rat. It’s probably just some prank, Parris. Don’t sweat it. Well that little twerp really pisses me off. I’m going to make him wish that he never had called me. You get em, Parris. Parris? Brandon? What are you doing nosing around here? Well, your man, Lyle, called me up yesterday. We set up a meeting at the station. He was a no-show. So I came over to let him have it for standing me up. He's kind of a weird guy. Well, I gathered that much on the phone. He probably just reconsidered. Yeah I guess. Do me a favor. You got your master key? He didn't do anything. Yeah. But I got a hunch this guy's in there and just not opening the door. Alright. But if he complains, I had nothing to do with this, right? You don't worry about a thing I’II take full responsibility. Lyle! Hello! It’s Detective Parris. Remember me? We had a meeting today. You stood me up. I know you're in there. What was so important yesterday? Marks. You got to check this out. He’s a writer? He was a writer. He’s a struggling screenwriter and he was working on a horror script. Involving a bunch of homicides. So he moves in here because there have been a couple. He was doing research for a freakin movie. Where's Brandon? He’s in his place consoling Pammy. I just met him and now he’s gone. I just can’t believe it. How you guys holding up? We’re OK. She was just with him before it happened. Really! When did you last see him? I don’t know. Around five thirty. Six o’clock. And were you here? No. We were in my apartment. What were you two doing? He was letting the cable guy in. And did you guys argue about anything? No. Did he mention anything that would have suggested he was in trouble? No. Look. I thought this was just some kind of a random attack. Yeah. Except that there doesn't seem to be any evidence of forced entry. Usually the random types are looking for valuables or some sort of sexual gratification. There doesn't seem to be any evidence of that here. Well, what would make you think that I would know anything about this? Nothing. You just happen to be the last person to see him alive. I was just hoping that you could offer us some sort of clue. Well, I can't. OK. Now, we are going to need you to come down to the station tomorrow and give us a full statement. Oh and uh I’m going to need to take a look at your apartment if that’s OK. For what? Just checking the last known whereabouts. That's all. Don't worry. It won't take long. it's upstairs. It's apartment number five. Great. Thanks. Brandon. Don’t let it get to you. It’s just routine. Thank you for letting me come over here tonight. I don't I could spend the night alone after everything that's happened today. It's OK. I kind of could use some company myself. I mean, what is going on, Brandon? All these murders. I mean. They have to be related, right? Um. There's some crazy stuff that goes on in this town. You just never know. That does not make me feel any better. I'm sorry. It's probably just a coincidence. Look. Either way, we can take care of each other. I just feel like such a baby. Don’t. There’s nothing wrong with being a little scared. It’s OK. You've been so nice to me. I mean you're the one dealing with the loss here. Do you want to talk about anything? How are you doing? It's getting easier. I think it would have been a lot harder have we known each other for like ten years before she... I mean not that it's any easier like this. It's just... I don't know. I see people die all the time at work. Yeah. But that's a lot different when it happens to your own family. Yeah. I guess. You know. I used to have this cousin who used to work in E.R. He was a nurse. They used to have trauma cases coming in there all the time. He would see people die every day. I'd see him at Christmas and he'd tell me all about it and I'd think... How could you do this for a living? You know. But he was never too affected by it. He always had some wisecrack, funny remark about it. And then when his father died of a heart attack suddenly, I mean it devastated the family. It him like a ton of bricks. But it completely devastated Alex. I mean it took him a really long time to get passed my Uncle being gone. And then when I found out about Sammy I was I mean I was shocked. You know horribly saddened. Angry. All the things you’re supposed to be. I just couldn’t stop thinking about Alex and how hard he was taking it. And it... maybe it meant that I didn't care about Sammy or something. Of course that isn't true . Everybody deals with it differently I just really felt guilty about how I was handling it. That's awful. I mean it's hard enough to lose somebody. Then to beat yourself up over it. Come on. it just wasn't a good time. I mean. Not that now is a good time. I know what you mean. Thank you so much for this, Brandon. You're welcome. Well, I'm going to call it a night. You get some rest. Here's a blanket and a robe. I'll see you in the morning, OK? OK. Brandon. Brandon. Will you hold me? Here are the Chag. Chagnon reports you asked for. Thanks Sarge. Enjoy Hey West. You wouldn't believe what this guy did his research for his script. What do you mean? OK. In 1995, he volunteers at the coroner's office where he helped bagged, tagged and move bodies in and out of the morgue. In late 1997, he goes to work at the county clerk's office where he has access to all kinds of transcripts from homicide cases. Then in 1999, he's trailing FBI profilers as they track serial killers. You tell me. Hell. We could use a guy like that in the force huh. Instead of this rookie Niles. You know something, West? You're right. Either way you slice it, this guy was a real wacko. Good Morning. Good afternoon. I think. Is it? Yeah. I guess we didn't get much sleep last night. You're right about that. That was really... Ask Detective Parris tomorrow to go over ballistics report on apartment four to confirm my hunch. What hunch? Got to get access to apartment five. Something fascinating about the shooting up there. I wonder... ...There you are. Look. If you're trying to score some overtime, you can forget it, buster. Yeah. Like I need an angle to score some overtime. Captain's looking for you when you get a chance. I'll be right there. Hi, can I help you? Hello, I'm detective Parris. We spoke on the phone. So you said that you need to talk to me to confirm some information about my sister death. Yes ma'am. But this is pretty confidential police work. You know I shouldn't be in here too long. I'll probably be out of here before you know it. Well, is there anything that I can do to help? Actually no. You know this is pretty routine and also quite boring police work. So I think I can handle this on my own. Can I get you a cup of coffee then? That'd be great. Maybe a little bit of milk, cream, whatever you have. OK. Suspect drew weapon and fired, barely missing officer. Returned fire. Brought down suspect. How could she miss from here? She didn't shoot him. He lied. Is there something wrong, Detective? Nope. Not at all. Hi, how are you? Hi. What can I help you with? I was looking for a nice arrangement. OK. For a special occasion? Lady friend. Oh. Alright. Some roses or maybe some nice tulips. Why don't you surprise me. OK. I'll make you a beautiful bouquet and be back in a minute. Perfect. Hello. Hey. Hey how are you? Where are you? In your kitchen. Cooking you the best dinner that you've ever had. Is that right? Listen. Um. I was wondering. Do you have any Thyme? Oh I have the time all right. No the spice thyme. I have time for spice. No um. Thyme for cooking. I'm just kidding. It's to the right of the stove. Uh. I looked there. I couldn’t find any. Try the second shelf behind the beans. Ok. Great. Then I will see you in a little bit. Aright I will see you in a few. OK. Bye. Brandon! God help me! Hi Brandon. Oh you didn’t have to bring flowers. Marks, what the hell are you doing? Well, actually I'm glad you showed up. You can be here to witness the finale of my little project. What are you talking about? Come on Detective. Did you really have no idea what was going here? Lianne, I don't know what you're talking about but what I do know is you need to put that gun down. Don't patronize me officer. I've given that speech more often than you have. And don't even think about taking another step in this direction. Or I'm gonna take the both of you out. OK. OK. What do you want? What do you think? Why do you think I went through all this trouble, Brandon? Because it made me happy? Because it was fun? Because it made me laugh? Uh ugh. No. It didn’t make me laugh, Brandon. It made me cry. You made me cry. Lianne. Oh. No. Too late for talking sweetie Look no wait. I don't understand. You don't understand? What are you? An idiot? I killed them, Brandon. All of them. Heather, Parris, that writer. All of them. Just like I’m going to kill her. Don't you get it? I did it for you. For us. Lianne. It’s OK. Just. Don’t move, Brandon! Don’t move. Don’t you see what I’m trying to do here? I know you want me to prove my love for you. My worthiness. So I did. I showed you I could do it just like you. I took out that blabbing bitch wife of yours just like you took out that blabbing bitch neighbor. And just like you, I took out her tongue so she couldn't blab anymore. And that nosy writer he had to go to. He knew everything. And he was going to put the finger on you. I had to stop him. And Parris. He knew everything. He wanted so badly to see you go down, Brandon. I had to take him out. The last touch. The masterpiece. Was this one. Because after this, you would have no choice but to see that I was meant for you, Brandon. That I was the only one that could match you blow for blow. I was going to do it with a single bullet. Just like you did to her bitch sister. What? What did you just say? Oh yeah. Detective Burns here. Is the one who clubbed your little baby sister. No. Oh yeah. Brandon and Sammy were close for a time. Real close. You didn't think I knew about the two of you, did you? I followed you home after work one night. I knew you two were screwing regularly. Just like you couldn't resist screwing her. So anyway. He screwed your sister. And then when he needed an out, he shot her. Brandon? Don’t listen to her. She doesn’t know what the hell she’s talking about. Is it true? No. That's not the way it happened. How could you? And me? Sammy, I mean Pammy. I… ...You a sick bastard! Don't listen to her! You are unbelievable. I hope you rot in hell! No. Brandon. Oh god. Alright let's put this thing to bed. Mrs. Martin and Brandon get into a struggle. Right, and according to Marks, Mrs. Martin was um... finding out that Brandon was the one who shot her sister so she tries to kill him. OK. So Marks comes over checking up on Brandon. Hears the fighting going on. Rushes in and sees them wrestling for the gun. Right. She gets involved but she can’t stop her from popping him with a slug, so... He takes the hit. He falls back. Marks pistol whips the girl who drops right here. Let's wrap it up. This is too easy man. Man. How's she doing? I don’t know. Well she’s little shaken up. She lost her partner. So it’s got to be tough. Yeah. Let’s get out of here. She’s crashing. CPR Start. I’II radio for help. We have a crasher. I repeat we have a crasher. Where the hell is that ambulance? Get me some epinephrine right away. Forget it, we lost her. Cancel the ambulance. Cancel the ambulance. I repeat cancel the ambulance. The coroner’s already here. Shit! Burns is still alive. What? Brandon. Brandon what is it Honey? What? I just had the worst Dream. You OK? It was only Dream. It’s Ok. Go back to Sleep. Go back to Sleep.
