Base, this is Recon 1. We are tracking Tropical Storm Allison... heading toward Houston at 35 miles an hour. Heavy rains expected for the next 48 hours. Tests are continuing. Over. Roger, Recon 1. Stay with Allison. Some parts of Houston got more than 2 feet of rain... in less than 24 hours. The city was brought virtually to a standstill by the flooding. The deluge, brought on when Tropical Storm Allison... stalled after coming ashore... caught city officials, emergency workers.... Folks in Texas are dealing with a flood of trouble... thanks to what was Tropical Storm Allison. Allison is still dumping heavy rains on the Houston area... literally leaving drivers up to their necks in water. Remnants of Tropical Storm Allison... have dumped more than 2 feet of water... on the Houston area since moving ashore five days ago... flooding homes and freeways... stranding families on rooftops and in cars. ...tropical depression.... ...thousands of victims are still struggling with the deadly aftermath... -All right? -Yeah. ...bracing for weeks, perhaps months, of recovery ahead. Memorial, this is Life Flight 1 approaching your helipad. -Do you copy? -Roger that, Life Flight 1. We have a 42-year-old white female involved in a roliover MVA... with prolonged extrication. 10-70 setting down now. Medevac's here. Transport area, 15 minutes, ETA. -Radio for help. -Call backup now! Let's go! Yeah, you just want to keep pressure on that. Fine. Easy! All right, clear to go! It's going to be pretty loud. Don't worry, we're going to get you out of there. ETA, 10 minutes. We're on our way. Blood pressure's holding and steady. | got a composite.... -We're off! -Let's go! Well, you won't believe this, Jody, but the sun is out. Yeah, let's just hope it lasts. ...Huntington and Greens Bayou watersheds. | know. No. They're short-staffed... so I'll be doing charge for Shock Trauma and Emerg. Yup, and I'll see you in a few, Jody. Bye-bye. ...and muggy weather and continued clearing. Adios, Allison. Dr Samuelson, please report to the surgical waiting area. -Hey, Diana. -Hi, Jeanette. Whoa! -Hi, Jeanette. -Thank you. Respiratory therapy 0-5-0, please.... -Hey, Jody. -Hey, what you got? -l baked a cake for Lily. -Oh, how sweet. -So will you come up at first break? -Absolutely. | wouldn't miss that. -How you feeling? -Pretty good. He's been kicking like crazy ever since that storm passed. Now, just because he kicks doesn't mean he's a boy. But I'm talking crazy kicks. By the way, you said "he," too. You all save me some if I'm a few minutes late. Oh, we will. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the... most technologically advanced hospitals in the world... and the largest complex of hospitals certainly in our country. Excuse me. Your birthday today, Jeanette? No, but you are losing one of your finest, Mr MacKenna. You're letting her out for good behaviour. They come, they go, and so we march on. We do. So I'll see you at the staff meeting this afternoon? I'll be there. -Hey, Steve. -Afternoon. What's coming in tonight? Level 1 trauma, mother and daughter. They're Life Flighting the mum. She'll go right into O.R. The girl's being transported by ambulance. You'll see her in Emerg. Otherwise, things are finally calming down. Well, that's good news. Dr McMannis, to the cath lab. Great. Thank you. -Yes? -That is Lily's cake. -Lily who? -In Neo-natal. It's her last day of work. Radiology, check to MICU, stat. Oh, look at that! You had no right! | can surgically repair this if it's a big deal. -Wasn't she going to share? -At the appropriate time. Dr Foster to O.R. Didn't want it to go stale. Memorial, this is Life Flight 1, we're approaching your helipad. Do you copy? Roger that, Life Flight 1. Transport team is on the roof. She's on. Hold the bag. -How's the wind shear up there? -Okay. | turn around, the guy has cut a huge piece... -stuffing it into his face. -Right in front of you? -Foster's a piece of work. -He's a piece of something. One of these days, I'm gonna snap his damn pointy head off. Well, there are definitely some things about this place | am not gonna miss. -Well, it wouldn't be the babies. -No. I'll miss you all. You've been so much fun to work with. Well, definitely less stress, though. At an HMO? Not less, just different. There's got to be nice people who work for HMOs, right? -No. -Not as nice as us. When | call over there, | hope you're the one | get. Hey, make sure you leave us your extension number, traitor. You guys trying to make me feel bad about leaving here? Oh, nice. -This cake looks so good. -Not me. No, it's me. Gotta go. -I'll take that. I'm eating for two. -Oh, yeah. Aren't we all? Two vehicle MVA. Driver's coming by helicopter. This is the daughter, Ronnie Green, 14 years old. Her Glasgow Coma Scale: 15 out of 15 en route. BP's stable. Last one: 114 over 80. Hi, my name's Jeanette. Can you tell me where you think we are? -In a hospital? -That's right. Very good. Okay, now we are gonna be doing a little poking around here... for the next little while. And I'm sorry about that. But we need you to try and hold as still as possible. Okay? Where's my mum? -Doctor, the labs are back. -Okay, very good. Stats are down to 85. Second unit's in. -Pressure’s up to 100 systolic. -Nurse coming up? Right, people, there's 5 millimetres and reactive. Dr Foster's scrubbing up. Pressure's down to 60, 400 cc in the Thoraseal. -What you got, Ray? -Well, rainfall's at zero. Levels receding in the bayous and drainage channels overall. -How's it looking out there? -Not too bad. Ground's saturated but we should be all right if we don't get any more rain. Looks like we dodged a bullet. Warm and muggy with continued clearing. If there's any justice, we're gonna use those Astro tickets after all. Oh, yeah! They play, I'm there. Row 37, seat 19, my butt is there. The rest of you, too, | hope. She'll be in tomorrow. This is Baby Jeremy. He was born at 15:36 this afternoon... 28 weeks gestation. Mum went into preterm labour. He weighs 3 pounds, 8 ounces. First Apgar was 4. He wasn't making respiratory effort on his own, so he was intubated. We've already confirmed placement with x-ray. Umbilical lines are in. -I'm going to up it to 0.5. -I think that's a little much. -Let's ask Lily. -Okay. -And the doctor heard? -Oh, yeah, | said okay. -Get through a bolus feeding. -All right. -I'm tired. -Yeah, | bet. Christina, please call.... Hi, I'm Dr Estrada. I'll be the doctor for your son. Do you have any questions | can answer right now? Is he gonna be all right? Well, he's got a breathing tube which will help him out. You probably know his lungs weren't ready yet. His vital signs are stable. But the next 12 hours are critical. -When can | see him? -As soon as we get him stable. And when can | hold him? Well, he's just made a big move... but as soon as he's settled a bit, I think you can hold his hand. -l think you should rest now, Amelia. -l think that's a good idea. -Vitals? -Heart rate's 150. -BP's 80 over 40 and dropping. -Well, we've seen worse. You hung two units of O-neg till the cross-match is ready? Oh, yeah. -Scalpel. -Scalpel. So, | was playing roller hockey with my neighbour’s kids the other day... and this little squirt high-sticked me. -You hit him back? -No. He was too big for his age. Okay. We're going in. There we go. How's that helicopter ever gonna take off... -the way you pack in those doughnuts? -No worries. Anyway, we suspended the Life Flight... due to some mechanical problems we've had from all the rain. So the only action Emergency is gonna see tonight is drive-bys. -Well, that's always action aplenty. -You know it. Thanks. -You take care. -You, too, Tim. Bye-bye. Hey, that was so nice of you to make that cake today. Thank you. -Do you have to go right back up? -No. | got a couple more minutes. -How's Cody? -Oh, pure energy. We spent all day yesterday inside of the baby gym. -Did three sessions of Gymboree. -Oh, that sounds exhausting. This weather's been killing him. My poor folks. They can’t get Cody worn out enough to sleep at night. Oh, yeah. | can't wait to spend more time with him. He's so lucky to have you. And the teeniest babies in Houston won't be so lucky anymore. And the teeniest babies in Houston won't be so lucky anymore. -Oh, no. Don't you guilt-trip me, too. -No. | can't pass up on the money. And these hours will let me see Cody way more. | know. You're doing what you have to do. | don't blame you. We got a ruptured spleen. She has a lacerated liver. Man, she's got a lot of soft-tissue damage. Where'd that come from? -Clamp. -Clamp. Got it. Hang another litre of saline and have some dopamine standing by. She needed me Believed in me -Sponge. -Pressure’s down to 70 on 30. All right. ...found me out Remember when you first came on as a candy striper? Right away | knew you had it. -Oh, no. | didn't know a thing. -Well, that's true. But it was clear that you wanted to. And you turned into a great nurse. -That's pretty. Have | seen that before? -1 don't know. It was broken for awhile. It's a memory bracelet. Hal gave it to me after we lost Ellie. I'm gonna miss you, Jeanette. Mr Reade, you're still here? Well, she does better when I'm here. Well, you want to think about the long haul, though, right? You need to take care of yourself, too. The medication will help her sleep. Well, be careful. She snores real loud. And you'll call me if anything changes? Of course. I'll see you bright and early in the morning, okay? All right. Okay, ladies and gents, I'll leave the good people of Houston... -in your capable hands. -Chuck? What do you got, Ray? Looks like Allison's heading south and coming back at us. | guess your butt stays here. -Good night. -See you, Eddie. Damn. With the storm continuing to draw moisture from the Gulf... forecasters say many areas along the coast... are in for more heavy rain and possible flooding. -Hi, Charlie. -Hey. -How's our girl doing? -No contact number for the dad. The mother's still in the O.R. -Let me see. -Yeah. -Thanks, Charlie. -Okay. Hi, Ronnie. How you feeling? Remember me? Jeanette? Where's my mum? Can | see her? Not just yet, sweetie. She's in surgery. We have really good doctors and nurses... and they are taking care of her. | want you to look right at my nose. Good. You know, we're trying to get in touch with your dad. -Where does he live? -Austin. Do you know the phone number for him there? | really want to see my mum. Is she okay? You try and stay calm, okay? You're gonna need all your energy for getting better. Do you remember what happened? All | remember is my mum started screaming. That must've been scary. | know your mum would be really proud of you for being so brave. Does she know I'm okay? Well, | can go tell her, okay? And | will check on her and see how she's doing. You get some rest. I'll see you later. Somebody better call Maintenance. Let them know that we've got some problems down here. Good luck with that. The spleen is out, arteries are clamped. Where is all this blood coming from? BP is 60 by palp. Heart rate is dropping now. -Sponge. -Sponge. Hold this clamp. -Can you see anything? -No. It must be a retroperitoneal laceration. It's leaking badly. She's losing a lot of blood. Hang another litre of saline and get two units of blood up here, stat! Yes, Doctor. Pulse is weakening! Damn, she's still bleeding. -Clamp. -Clamp. We may need to angio-embolise this thing in her pelvis. | can't see. Hold the Richardson. Pull. Pull harder. The storm dumped up to 10 more inches of rain... causing flooding in and around Houston. The Red Cross has set up shelters.... What a day, huh? Can't sleep? -l feel | need to be with him. -He's going to be all right, hon. He couldn't be getting better care. Some people say that babies choose to come into this world. And they choose who their parents will be. And | don't want this baby to be undecided. | don't want him to change his mind. ...moved off the west coast of Africa as far back as the 21st of May. Strong pressure gradient.... ...sustained winds increasing.... Oh, boy! Blood lab. Jody, hi. It's Jeanette. | had a-- Oh, my God. The weirdest thing just happened. There's all this water on the floor. First | thought my water broke. -Are you all right? -Yeah. I slipped. There's a lot of water. Did you call Maintenance? Yeah, I called them. O _R.'s waiting on some blood, stat. So [ called a porter but nobody’s answering. Well, you know what? Hold tight. I'll come down. You're a doll. Thanks. Oh, | am glad I'm not out there. - What's up? - O_R. needs blood, stat. -Well, where are the ward aides? -That's a very good question. -You want me to get it? I'll go. -No. You're on break. And | want to check on Jody. Hey, what's up with Lily? Why is she leaving? Not enough money, long hours. Any of that sound familiar? Not enough money, long hours. Any of that sound familiar? Oh, yeah. Tell me about it. -Anyway, I'll catch up with you later. -Okay, bye, Charlie. Oh, come on. Dr McMannis to the cath lab. Jody? Hey, Jeanette. -What happened here? -A pipe burst. | don't know. -Well, who all else is down here? -Nobody. Immunology and the main lab aren't staffed after 6:00. Here you go. Two units, O-neg. We need to get all this blood out of here. | know. You're right. Look, you take this, and | will take care of this. -But you don't know the protocol. -Where is it? -It's in that policy manual on the top. -Okay, now | know, you go. -Are you sure you're gonna be all right? -I'm fine. Just go. Don't forget those black binders. They're the patient antibody files. -Okay. Be careful. -Okay! Oh, boy. Here we go again. Allison’s back with a vengeance. We're gonna get hit hard. There's gonna be nowhere for that water to go. How far are the bayous from the top of the bank? -Two feet and rising. -Elevate the alert level. Issue a flash flood warning for the entire county. Notify all agencies and get everyone in here. Here we go. What the devil she have to come back for? -Sponge. -Sponge. -Where's our blood? -l told them we needed it stat. Blood pressure’'s falling, Doctor. BP's 55 by palp. Heart rate is 45. Well, it took you long enough! There was a situation, Doctor. This is a situation, too. It's called surgery... where the odds of success are greatly enhanced... by the proper flow of blood. Is that understood? Yes, Doctor. -Sponge. -Sponge, Doctor. Hang the blood now. Triatrophene, 1 milligram. Hold that back. -Sponge. -Sponge. Oh, my God. Jeanette? -Jeanette! -Yeah, I'm in here! -Jody said you needed some help. -Grab those coolers. Maintenance needs to get those refrigerators out of here. -Finish loading the O-negative... -Yeah. ...and the plasma, and get it upstairs quick. Right. You take this one. I'll go back and get some more in the refrigerator. Buffalo downtown, White Oak, Sims in the southwest. Bayous are either rising or top of bank. Barriers should be up at all structures in the watersheds. Chuck, Harris County 911 has just flooded out. They want to know if they can set up here. If they can get in. Houston Power and Light is on line one. Dave, Chuck. Chuck, the flooding is reaching some of our underground facilities. If it continues, power could be affected in our service area. Where? Well, downtown at the Texas Medical Centres. They are both served by transformers... that are contained in building vaults below street level. -Any backup? -No, we've got pumps in there now. -How many more do you need? -Well, anything you can spare. We'll see what we can do. The Medical Centre's in the Brays Bayou watershed... what's their situation? Peak flow in the bayou is now at 15,000 cubic feet per second. -Give them a heads up. -You got it. Hello? Sorry to wake you, Mr MacKenna. Is there a problem, Eddie? Yeah, well, we've got a lot of water down here. The Office of Emergency Management called in an alert. They say we may lose city power. I secured the generators. They're all parallel and running correctly. Keep me posted, Eddie. Yes, sir. Jeanette, we got to go. Water's coming in everywhere. Take this. Okay. Let's get out of here. Go, go, go! Go! Go! Hold it! We can't go this way! Come on! That's good. | think it's behind here. Backup will kick in, in a second. We're on backup. Take her vitals, please. Blood's imperative. Light's important, too. Oh, my God! Grab hold of me, Kim. Kim! Grab hold of me! There's another staircase! Go, go, go! We made it. You know what? I never liked these shoes anyway. -You okay? -I'm just worried about you and Junior. -We're okay. -Good. What? Not again. That's not good. -Sir, the basement's flooded. -What? We’re on emergency backup. The switches are flooded. We've lost power to Jones Pavilion, Robertson, Cullen, and Hermann. The generators? Well, the water keeps gushing up through the drains. It's going up over the dams. We're gonna lose everything. Shut them down. Shut them down! -Light. -Sorry. No, down in there. -Oh, come on. -I'm losing her pulse. Come on. | see it. -Clamp. -Clamp. All right. -All right, sutures. -Sutures. Okay, can everybody see? You've got your Ambu bag at every Isolette. These babies are gonna be fine. The IVs have backup batteries. -So let's start bagging. -Okay. We got her pulse back. It's weak, but it's steady. She's a fighter. She wants to live. This is amazing. -The sutures. -Sutures, Doctor. This one's good. You know, it's always darkest before it's totally black. You want to take a break and go skinny-dipping downstairs, Jeanette? Shut up, Charlie. What? You afraid there might be crocodiles? Has anybody thought about leaving? How are we gonna do all of this without power? Ladies, ladies, it's not a problem. It's an opportunity. Really shut up, Charlie. Playtime's over. Wish you'd stayed home instead of coming to work today? Wouldn't have been a bad sick day, huh? The phones are down, too. You think it's the whole hospital? -Probably. -Oxygen supply's fine. It's on a separate pressurized system that doesn't need power. Some of the machines have battery backup, too... but not the ventilators. Those patients, we will have to bag by hand. I'm going to Shock Trauma. Okay, let me know what you hear. I'll keep every juicy titbit for you, Charlie. Six inches of rain in an hour. Look at this. Downtown Houston's definitely got a problem. Mum? What's happening? It's Jeanette. I'm here. It's okay, Ronnie. -What happened to the lights? -The storm knocked everything out. It's okay. I'm scared. Would you like a flashlight? | have an extra one. Just twist the back. Now, you get some rest. Nothing else bad is going to happen. Did you talk to my mum? Did you tell her I'm okay? -She's dead, isn't she? -No. She's dead. That's why you won't tell me anything! You have to let me go see her. You have to let me go. Is she dead? No, no, no. She was seriously hurt. But we are doing everything possible for her, and she's in the best of hands. The best thing for you is just to get some rest, okay? I'll check back with you. -l can't get a signal. -All the hospital lines are down, too. -Where have you been? Asleep? -Try O.R. in the dark. Sorry, Dr Foster. So how long's the grid down? Does anyone know? Well, they're working on it, | guess. Nurse! My television isn't working! -That's you, cable guy. -Thanks. We're going back to basics, everybody. Feel for pulse and temp, observe breathing and colour. Don't forget to breathe yourself. We've got to keep the babies stable, breathing, and fed. Now, | want you to reduce lipids to conserve power... on the IV battery packs. But make sure the remaining IV is providing their fluids. -Right. -All right. Hopefully that'll do till the power comes back on. All right. Get their temps. -Hey, Phoebe. -Hi. -How's Jeremy? Al -Hey, Doc. Who turned off the lights? -Wasn't me. | paid my bill. At first | thought | didn't make it off the table. Open your eyes. Your procedure was like a dream. All ear reattachments should be that much fun, huh? Yeah, it's your.... It's your chest we're worried about. Now, listen. You better stay out of trouble tonight if you want to hang on to that other ear. I'm serious. I'll take it. | got a necklace of them. -Rest. -1 will. -What's the problem? -Just checking the dosage. Well, why do you keep checking it? Did you give her the wrong medication? They teach in nursing school to check the bottle three times... before administering meds, Doctor. It's a normal safety check, standard procedure. How are you gonna keep this patient alive without power? We do BPs by cuff... monitor oxygenation with skin colour and warmth... and, as you can see, we can bag. How we used to. It was part of basic training... before we got too fancy. We even had electricity then. The storm that won't quit. The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison... has dumped more than 2 feet of water on the Houston area... flooding homes and freeways, stranding families. At least 3,000 homes and businesses have been damaged... 10,000 families displaced... and hundreds of rescues by helicopters and boats. The people of Texas are dealing with a flood.... -What's the latest, Eddie? -Nothing about us. But there's flooding everywhere. Mr MacKenna's calling around for pumps and generators. -How long is it gonna take? -No clue. That's why he told me to go up to Emergency and help out there. Any idea how to save a lot of blood without refrigeration? -Well, I'll work on it. -Okay, Eddie. -Thanks. -Yeah. The city was caught virtually at a standstill.... Oh, dear God. -Jeanette? -Over here. That's got to be 6 feet deep. The pumps aren't gonna cut it. Not with flooding like this. We're not getting our power back. MacKenna is trying right now to get generators. People are gonna start dying soon, Jeanette, unless we do something. -We've got to evacuate the hospital. -Evacuate in this? Where to? With what? We don't even know if we can get out of here. Well, what's the alternative? Right now, it's to hold on for dear life and do our job. Hopefully they'll get the power up soon. You know how vulnerable my post-ops are. You know, beside your post-ops, we've got transplants on the 9th floor... neonates, a burn unit on 7. How are we gonna get all these people out... without killing them in the process? Two by two, just like the Good Book says. | don't think your usual condescension is the answer right now. Look. It's not that | don't respect you, Jeanette... but | don't see what other choice we have. We move these people, we put them in jeopardy... and it could be for no reason. And it could be the only way to save their lives. I've already established that this could be the best way to save them. The only thing that's been established here is that we are in a lot of trouble! I'm not just gonna sit around and wait. Maybe if we fight like hell, but with a realistic strategy. Base, this is Recon 1. We're giving you an update on our analysis of Tropical Storm Allison. Extremely heavy rainfall has occurred over much of eastern Texas. Over 20 inches of rain fell within a 12-hour period. Allison has turned out to be the flood of record... for the Houston metropolitan area. We got flooding all over the city. Especially the metro downtown area. The underground garage at Tranquillity Park is flooded... Jones Hall and Jones Plaza, the Wortham Centre... the Alley Theatre in the Theatre District, the Bank of America Centre... -and all pedestrian tunnels. -That's most of downtown. We need a declaration of disaster. We already put in a request to FEMA. What we get and when, there's no telling. In the meantime... we're gonna need pumps and police department dive teams. They've already been dispatched. They've already been dispatched. How are we doing on fire and rescue personnel? With flooding like this, the truth is... we don't have effective emergency capability. Our vehicles just don't have enough clearance. -Buddy, Public Works hear that? -We sure did. Our fleet of garbage trucks and buses are standing by. They're all high-clearance... and have a better chance of navigating that water. Captain, you got your high-clearance wheels. -Damn it! -What's going on? -With no power, | can't get to the meds. -Of course, it's all computerized. Well, get what you can off the crash carts. Guess I'll have to. -And while you're at it, get a crowbar. -Oh, | will. We've got 79 babies, 22 on ventilators. They're Level 1s. We're okay with oxygen, but | don't know how long that'll last. Even by reducing IV power use, | figure we'll lose battery power... by 9:00, 10:00 a.m. at the latest. And then we've got no way to get fluids into the babies. Now, | want every baby examined... and a written rating of who is most critical... to be transported first. And, Lily, once we prioritise, | want each name entered here. This will be Control Centre. Then get every cell phone you can and start calling. We've got to find places in other hospitals. Nobody's coming up from downstairs to help. They're completely flooded. We've got to be ready to move. -Okay. -We will be. -Thank you, Doctor. -I'll help you. Doctor, | don't know how long Baby Jeremy is gonna last. I mean, he has to be priority, top priority. You are being so brave. Just keep still. How are you doing? Do you need to be spelled? Il don't know what I'd do if 1 lost any of them. What would I tell their parents? Oh, Phoebe. Just keep doing what you're doing. You're amazing, okay? Pressure's down to 60. Wish we could get inside and double check. Lily, how are the babies? Things are a little busy tonight here on 7. So you don't want to go down and get a coffee? How are you holding up? Well, my hair is frizzing. Some send-off, huh? | forgot all about it being my last night. No time to think, | guess. You know what? | am really glad you're still there. Likewise. Did you talk to Cody? No. | couldn’t get through. | have no idea how he's doing. He usually sleeps through the night. But what if he wakes up in the middle of the storm, and I'm not there for him? He's safe. He's in good hands. Yeah, but they're not mine. Lily, you are a great mother. Now, | know it's hard, but you're gonna see him soon. We're getting ready to move these babies out... in case the power doesn't come back on. Really? Well, you too, right? Well, that decision hasn't been made yet. Any news? Nada. It's like the world forgot about us. Lily, would you come over here, please? | gotta go. He seems distressed. His heart rate is dropping. I'll take over. Something's wrong. Something's happened. What is it? Jeremy. Honey, what are you doing? I'll be right with you, ma’am. -What happened to the lights? -We lost power. -And emergency power? -We've lost that, too. -Where are the stairs? -They're right there. But look, ma'am, I think you should just stay on this floor. | didn't ask you what you think | should do. Okay, okay. Hold on, Amelia. Wait here. I'll go up. No, | can't. Amelia, it's not a good idea. He's our baby and he needs us. This is the fifth floor. Jeremy's on the seventh. You grab my belt. I'll go first. Keep going. Tim. What's happening? Our copters are grounded, so I'm sending them to Fort Bend... to have them lifted in. We gotta make a move, Tim. | saw what MacKenna can't. He's waiting on an assessment. An assessment, okay. "Incompetence and Inaction Lead to High Casualty Rate... “at Memorial Hermann.” How'’s that for an assessment? Or would he prefer, "Massive Loss of Life Seen as Avoidable Tragedy"? We've gotta move now. Look, that's not your decision to make. I've been contacting every hospital... and carrier service to see what can be done... if we have to evacuate from here. Don't ask them "if." Tell them we need them now. Listen, Doc. I'm doing everything | can, all right? Just take it easy. Be right with you, ma'am. You doing all right, hon? I'll make it. We'll have a story to tell our birthing class now. You're doing great. Hang in there. I'm fine. Almost there. -Where's my son Jeremy? -He's right here. Oh, Jeremy. There he is. Can | hold him? I wanna hold him. | don't know if.... | can't think of anyone better. Why don't you pull up that chair over there, Mr Walker? Yeah. Okay. Angelito. What a big adventure you've had. If you want to put him right next to your skin, that'd be great. Would you like to bag him? Yeah, sure. | guess. How? Just press on this gently I'm gonna count two. One. Two. One. Two. One. Two. That's it. Daddy's here, too. His heart rate's improving already. ...get the power on as fast as we can. How is she doing? She might need an inotrope for her BP... but | think she'll pull through. Thank you, Helen. Hot in here, isn't it? Maybe this'll help. Did you tell my mum I'm fine? Well, you are some trouper, my dear, if you call this fine. But, yes, you are gonna be fine. And, no, | haven't spoken to her yet. How old are you? Thirteen? Fourteen. | was close. Same age as my girl would be now. Where is she? She passed away. What happened to her? It was a long time ago. She was two years old when she died. But maybe you can believe me when | tell you that mums... somehow know when their little girls are in trouble... and when they're gonna be fine. I'm sorry. -What was her name? -Eleanor Jane. Ellie. It's there. Is my mum still sleeping? Yes. Did you get ahold of my dad? No. But you know what? The roads are so crazy out there... from this storm, I'm not sure anybody could even get here. He doesn't even know I'm here. He's not gonna come. The rain has diminished this morning, but flooding is widespread... throughout downtown Houston. All available emergency equipment and manpower... are stretched to their limits. The Office of Emergency Management has requested help... in the form of vehicles and qualified personnel... from outgoing areas. Emergency crews are working 24-hour shifts. FEMA has declared Houston a disaster area... with at least 3,000 homes and businesses destroyed... and over 10,000 families displaced. They.... They found another one. | don't know if this is a day we want to see. -It's for you, sir, an emergency call. -Thank you. Whortle. -Mr Whortle? -Yes? I'm Dr Tom Foster. I'm the surgeon on call here... at Memorial Hermann Hospital. Yes, Doctor. What can | do for you? -We've got no power. -You have your own backup, don't you? No, we've lost everything. It's all gone. We need to evacuate. -You're calling for the hospital? -No. I'm calling for the patients. I need to hear from the hospital administration. There is not time to go through the proper channels here, okay? We're talking about life and death. Well, I appreciate that, Doctor. But you gotta understand, we flat out don’t have vehicles. No way we can get to you for three or four days. Three or four days? We don't have days. We've got hours. Look, | want to help. But I have no manpower right now to do anything more than we're doing. I'm sorry. | really am sorry. | don't care what he says. We're gonna need to evacuate this hospital. Can you put a patient list together? MacKenna's here. Can the generators be salvaged? If we pump out the water, can power be restored quickly? Go. The public is being told not to come to Memorial Hermann. The roads are dangerous and many are impassable. Emergencies are being redirected to other hospitals. Channel 5 News has learnt that if you come to Memorial Hermann... you will not get in as the hospital is closed. Memorial Hermann lost power this morning at 1:00 a.m... when its backup generators failed. Can | have your first name and ID? Why can't we get in? These are just staff and medical students who work here. So the best thing you can do right now is to just wait and we will let you know... how your friends and loved ones are doing. My father’s in there. We'd all like to see our families. -Hal. -Just a second, Dr Foster. We need to evacuate, Hal. Otherwise we're gonna lose patients. Doctor, | am aware of the patients. -They're our sole concern. -Then we're wasting time. Have you thought about what it means... to move critical and unstable patients, Doctor? Burn victims, the risk of infection.... It's because they're vulnerable they must be moved. QOur critical patients can't survive without power. There is no alternative. Jeanette? | know the risks are huge. But | think we have to be brave enough to give them a fighting chance. All I have to go on are my instincts and my experience. But both say that evacuating is the right thing to do. The logistics are damn near impossible. Absolutely impossible. Where the hell are we gonna find the manpower to bring 600 patients out? Not all the patients are critical. Some of them can go home. This hospital has been in continuous operation for 76 years. It's not the building that makes this hospital great, Hal. It's our commitment to the patients. We really don't know how we're going to get them out of here right now. All right. We'll do it. I've got calls out to every hospital administrator as far as Galveston... and every ambulance service | know. Okay. A nurse needs to attend every critical patient. If | know my staff, every off-duty nurse is on their way here now. | need to ask you a favour, Tom. Your critical patient, Cynthia Green, | have her daughter in Emerg. Your critical patient, Cynthia Green, | have her daughter in Emerg. The mother is all this girl has. They need to go to the same hospital. I'll do the best | can. | ask you one question, and you shut down the whole hospital. | pray to God we're doing the right thing. We all do. I'll make the announcement. Take it to the park. We're cleared to land on McGregor but we're platforming in the park. Roger that. How many do you need? All you've got, Don. I'm gonna need every ambulance your service can spare. Okay, Charlie. Woodlands Hospital can give us six beds... but we're gonna have to bring our own vents and monitors with us, all right? Six beds, furnished. Got it, right. Dispatch. I've found two of our ambulances. Keys are still in the ignition except they're locked... with the windows rolled up. What are you waiting for? It's hospital property. And we will let you know how your friends and loved ones are doing. Are you evacuating? Yes, we are evacuating the hospital. Now, obviously it's better not to move patients, so we're hopeful... that power can be restored as quickly as possible. Thank you. ...Houston.... ...really hit hard by Tropical Storm Allison. ...the entire downtown area completely flooded. Grim reality, it will take days, if not weeks, to regain any kind of power. Hospital officials declare the complete evacuation... of Memorial Hermann Hospital. -So, what's the plan? -We're making it up as we go along. Listen up. This is Command Centre. Everyone and everything that leaves this hospital must check in here. Notify your departments. Eddie, we will need all the cell phones you can find. And try and find some food and water to bring in. -Are we really doing it? -Yup. This is insane. Whose idea was it to evacuate? -Foster's. -Who does he think he is? And mine. Well, | guess it's the only thing to do. Jeanette, please have my post-op in Bed 4 ready to move right away. Okay. | believe we should begin with the Cardiovascular Unit, Doctor. No. We got patients in Medical who are just as sick. Hold on. We're never gonna get them out this way. Jeanette, we need to work from a prioritised list. Patients on vents and drips should go first. Let's go. Scouts! Fall in! Repeating our top story... administrators at Memorial Hermann Hospital... are preparing to evacuate over 500 patients. Memorial Hermann. That's just down the block here. Let's go. Maybe we can help! Chuck, the President's declared the county a disaster area. How long till we get help? Well, the Governor's authorising the Guard as we speak. | don't care about the Governor, the President. | didn't vote for neither of them. | just want to know how long it's gonna take to get the city operating again. Yeah. Volunteers showed up, and we need to get them organised. Dr Foster, what do you want to do with all the volunteers? Let's put them to work. Let's break them into groups and assign some leaders. All right. Excuse me, ma'am. We're a troop. Can we help? You bet. It's great to see you. Okay, everybody, my name's Jody. If you would just line up over here for instructions... we could get you all to work. Thank you for coming. This is a big help. If you could line up in three lines. One, two, three. We'll get you all to work as soon as we can. We've got to move fast. Our oxygen's going. -There's a problem in Shock Trauma. -That's my unit. I want him to go first. He's the sickest. Were you aware of our priority list, Doctor? | don't care. He's the sickest. He's in cardiac, renal, and pulmonary failure. He's a slow code. There are others who would benefit more. | think we're ready now. How are we doing here? Not as easy as it looks. Why don't you have a rest? We'll take over from here. -l don't even know your name. -Lily. Thank you, Lily. -As soon as we can. -Okay. | got a couple more that I've got on the second floor. Hey, there. We are gonna get you to a hospital with real air conditioning. We're clearing everybody out of here. My mum, too? That's the plan. Hey, Jeanette. The oxygen pressure's low. We're running out. I'll see what | can find out. Okay, ladies. Here's some more. Keep it going. Hey, keep those aisles clear, okay? Go! Next. Go. Next. So without computers, we have no way of keeping track of the patients... except for their patient ID stickers, as to who they are and where they're going. They're all colour-coded. Blue is for Ben Taub. Cullen 3, CVICU, Bed 1. We're ready. Excellent. Thank you. Okay. Cullen 3, CVICU, Bed 1. Let's go. Just up there. You know where the tower is. Thank you. Hurry up. Okay, let's lift this one off. Here we go. Going to Southwest. Right outside. The ambulances are coming around. Here we go. 7 Robertson, Burn Unit, Bed 3. Where's the big water? Is the big water coming? Some water over here. All those patients who can walk out on their own or are being picked up... by friends and family, please check in here, so we can keep track of you. He means with me, folks! Could you take somebody else? I'm still not ready. Well, sure. Here's more bread for you. Keep making them as fast as you can. We need all you can get. We gotta get the patients out of here. Thank you. It's a bit of a trip, but at least you'll get a good workout. Not a problem, ma'am. It's why we're here. Going to Ben Taub. The ambulance is outside. -Oh, good. Another Priority 1. -Okay, great. Thanks. And this one is assigned to Southwest and the ambulance is waiting outside. -Here you go, Jeanette. -Picked up? Gone to Woodlands. Watch the lines there. -Get his chart with him. -Yeah, got it. Hold the door. 1 got it. Not too fast. All right. -Can you get around there? -Yeah, thanks. Don't worry about it. You got it. It's so good to see you. | want transport nurses to prepare the babies. Make sure their examination summary and time of last feeding is showing. And just a reminder, even though | know you all know it: They must be kept as calm and as quiet as possible. -Okay, let's get ready. -All right, Lily. -All right, we'll take her. -All right. You got her? Thank you. -Yeah. -Go on, then. Thanks a lot. All right. That's it for the burn ward. Let's bring the next one in. Hold the door. One, two, three, lift. There you go. Door. Easy. Head up. Watch your lines. Okay, guys, level, level, level. Bring her up. That's it. Thataway. -Is she showing any signs of distress? -We're not sure. -Pulse is good, huh? -It's strong. That's it. Hey, watch the IV. All right, good job. Easy, easy. Time of feeding, 11:36. Now that each baby has been fed and bundled, make sure... they're labelled correctly and be ready to go on their word, all right? All right, we're fully loaded. Bring the next one up. -Let's go. -All right. Okay, next group, if | could get you inside, that would be great. This way. Excellent. Lily, we have a problem. We'll have to wait on Level 1s. But they're the most critical. There are no hospitals in the area that can handle babies of this acuity. They'll have to go to Galveston. We can move the less critical babies. All right. We're gonna take the Level 2s and Level 3s now. -We'll have to wait on the Level 1s. -Why? Let the others know. They said they'd be waiting right outside the door. Eddie, as we clear out the units, we want to make sure... nobody gets left behind. Jeanette, my post-op, Bed 4. Okay. Thank you, Doctor. All right. Next ambulance up here. Here's Ronnie. I'll take it from here. Thanks, Charlie. Okay. Jeanette, this patient isn't a priority, is she? She's not on the list. Sometimes there are other priorities. Okay. Keep her here till the ambulance gets here. Hey, how's it going? Mum, it's me, Ronnie. Mum, | missed you. | love you. Thank you. Here we go. You all will be talking to each other before you know it. Despite how bad she looks, she actually looks pretty good. I'll come visit, okay? Okay. Bye. Which one's first? -We're bringing them down. -We don't have choppers. We can't wait much longer. At least we'll be that much closer. If they get here at all. -This is Chuck. -Yeah, Mr Whortle? This is Tom Foster at Memorial Hermann Hospital again. We need to get 22 babies to Galveston. These are the tiniest, most fragile infants you can imagine. They already make a superhuman effort every moment, just to stay alive. And they are not gonna make it on our sidewalk. | would do anything in my power to help them if | could. | don't know what to tell you. Tell me you'll find a way. Twenty-two babies. It’s only a statistic, | know. But not to their families. Not if any of them dies because we didn't try and do enough. All right, | got it. Here we go. Okay, stay together. Keep moving. Keep the bagging steady. Here we go. So what's up? Baylor Med in Galveston can accommodate them... but we don't have the choppers to get them there. We need a status report on helicopters for Neo-natal. Things are getting scary up there. We got 22 babies who might not make it. We got babies, nurses and equipment. Life Flight just can't deal with it. All right, careful. This is the last of them. Can somebody get the door? Yeah. Okay. -Okay. -Come on. Stand clear. Babies first. Make way for the babies. You're gonna be fine. Okay. -Get it? -Yeah. Careful. Don't rush. Watch yourself. Give me some legroom. Look at you. Not yet. After everybody else. I think your family's been waiting for you. We've got Perez, Hernandez, and Walker's right behind. -Where do we put it? -Right through here, please. -Bring it over here. -Okay, | got you. Jeanette, our Life Flight helicopters can take a couple of Isolettes... when they get back. But after that, | don't know. Well, what are we supposed to do? Just sit here? | mean, time is not on our side with these babies, Tim. Doesn't sound like one of ours. -Stay here. -Just hang tight. That's the National Guard. Keep them coming in. Number 1's cleared for landing. Let's bring them out! How long have you been a nurse? Twenty-one years. I think I'm gonna try and beat that. All right, let's go, let's go. Bring them all down. Let's go. Come on, come on. We don't have a lot of time. This way. It's going to be fine. It's going to be okay. Thanks. You take care of him. Thank you so much. Jeremy won't remember this, but we will never forget what you did for us. Thank you, Lily. You be safe. -Thank you both. -Goodbye. | need to go, ladies. Bye. Clear! Good. All right, guys. There you go, Doc. -You Foster? -Yeah. | thought I'd come down and see who this young, pushy doctor is. -Chuck Whortle. -Nice to meet you, Chuck. So what's the deal? Well, we haven't lost anybody yet. -Nice going, Doc. -Yeah. Hey, Whortle. You came through. Let's hope we did enough. Now? Am | the last one? -You sure? -Yes, ma'am. All right, then. What are we waiting for? Ladies and gentlemen, the last patient out! ...makes this hospital great, Hal. It's our commitment to the patients. How many of these? People are going to start dying soon, Jeanette, unless we do something. It's time to go. Where are you parked? I am in the basement. In that case, would you like a ride? Sure. So which hospital should we begin rounds in first, Ms Makins? Oh, it's up to me? Did you really make that chocolate cake? You bet | did. This is me. Would you make one for me? We'll see.
