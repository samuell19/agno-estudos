When the shooting started, FBI agents were taken by surprise. Miss Jacqueline Kennedy, the president's wife, is now keeping vigil by the president's bedside. The world prays for him and his family tonight. For John F. Kennedy and for peace. (thunder booms) (rain patters) (car honks) (tires squeal) (dramatic atmosphere music) (uplifting orchestra music) (bicycle bell rings) - Watch out! Sergeant, am I late? - The Native Commissioner is never late. It is the others who are early. - Are they very early? - Very. - Damn. (speaking foreign language) - The court is in session. May it please Your Worship to proceed with the first case on the roll, Regina versus Tiki. (speaking in foreign language) - And what has Tiki done? - Drunk, while riding a bicycle on Niepoth Road, Your Worship. (scattered laughing) - Were there any witnesses? - He crashed on the Free Delphi Constable Tobias. - I see. Now what do you have to say for yourself? This is a most serious case indeed. The Niepoth Road is a road in law even if it is not one in fact. You might have ridden into one of those giant potholes and never been seen again. I find I must sentence you to the maximum allowed in law. Fined one penny. (gasps and murmurs) Next case. (singing in foreign language) - You should get yourself a wife here, my fellow. - An Assistant District Commissioner doesn't earn enough to support a wife. - A good wife is cheap, she will work for you. - But I already have someone to cook for me. - It's not a cook you need. (men laughing) (rhythmic drumming) Well brewed beer, try it. - Inkosi, as representative of Her Majesty the Queen, I have been instructed to inform you of your move from your villages. As you know, the new dam at Kariba is going to flood your whole valley. (laughing) - Floods come every year, and every year they go away. (laughing) - As far as we can see will become a lake. (men laughing) Ah, now here's the dam in construction. Now when it's finished, it's going to hold back the waters of the Zambezi and flood your whole valley. And you'll have to move out. But on the other hand, it's gonna produce electricity for mines, factories. Industries. Now this gives you an idea of what the Kariba Dam will look like. (muttering in foreign language) - What will happen when the wall is finished? - The waters will rise and you will have to leave. - This is the land of our ancestors. - This is a trick so that the white man can steal our land. - Who says this? - The men from the cities. The black men with suits. - It's no trick. When the rains come there will be nothing here but water. - This is sacred land. - The government trucks will come to take your people away, you must be ready for them. Now I'll be back here before the trucks arrive. (speaking in foreign language) (birds chirping) (door slams shut) (car revs) (men laughing) (upbeat dance music) - You got a light for me there Joe? The dam's going to change this place in a big way. And if we all play our cards right, all of us will come out of it very rich men. - Some maybe. I'm happy with the way things are. (cheers) (glass breaks) Max, what's going on in here tonight? - Some VIP is showing them very indifferent (mumbles). - Two glasses of red wine please. - Excuse me, do you mind holding that? Right, and that leaves both hands for you to take your name and number. (men laughing) - Leave the girl alone! - What do you think you're doing? - I'm terribly sorry, I just thought he was giving you a hard time. - I can take care of myself. - Would you like me to help you sponge down your dress? - In here? (dog barks) - I won't be gone more than a week, Sergeant. If you need me, just go on the radio. - Yes sir. - Got everything Samson? - Yeah, we're good! - All right, let's go. Look after the place, Sergeant. (speaking foreign language) (dog barks) (uplifting rhythmic drum music) - My people have a saying. If you want to catch an Impala, you don't try to outrun it. You people say more haste, less speed. (laughing) Inkosi, What is the importance of this great dam they are building? - Power's gonna supply electricity to the whole of Rhodesia. And to the countries all around. - [Samson] Yes, but what happens to the people who have to leave their villages? - [Joe] Samson, Her Majesty's government takes care of all of her people. They'll be far better off in the long run. - I know. Her Majesty's government does not make mistakes. But if it did, then you will never ever have the trust of these people again. Termites. To keep the mosquitoes away, inkosi. - Where's your home Samson? - When I'm not with you, inkosi, it's up on the hills. Away from the flood. - Do you have any family? - Yeah. I have three wives and six sons. - Three wives? (laughing) - Yeah. - Don't you miss them? - I do miss them, inkosi. But I send them money. I don't see them very often. - But why not? - Because then I'll have too many sons and a big family's hard to keep nowadays. (laughing) Goodnight, inkosi. - Sleep well. (birds chirping) - Hello. Have you come to rescue me again? - Well I won't offer to help you clean up this time. How long you been here? - About an hour. I think my axel's broken. - Let's have a look. Well, can't fix that. Where are you heading? - Well I have to get to my father's farm at Sitatunga. - Well I'm going to Chipappo. I'll arrange for someone to take you on from there and we'll get somebody to come back and rescue your car. - Thank you very much. - Samson, get this luggage out of here and put it in the Land Rover. - (mumbles). - Oh, my name's Joe. Mahoney. - Suzanna de Villiers. I'm sorry. - (laughs) Get in. (singing in foreign language) - What are they doing? - They are digging out their totems and telling the ancestors they are leaving. - What are the totems? - Totems. They are the soul of the family. They will take them wherever they are moved to. But their spirit will be drowned by the waters. (singing in foreign language) - Where will they go? - We cleared acres of lands for them up in (mumbles). - How can you watch what is happening? - Decisions are made in the other side of the world. All I can do is to see that they suffer as little as possible. - I believe wherever you move them, they'll end up in the townships. (singing in foreign language) (dramatic atmosphere music) - Well how are they? - As ready as they'll ever be. - We better move it then. Carry on men! Clears the huts! (argumentative chatter) (children screaming and crying) - Samson, can you help him? Gently with him. - Get on there, move, get moving. (villagers sobbing) - Leave those! - [Joe] No, wait! - [Max] What's the matter? - Max, let them take their totems. - There's no room. - [Joe] Then make room, dammit! - For God's sake, they're just a bunch of bloody planks man. (chanting in foreign language) (dramatic atmosphere music) (speaking in foreign language) I think you'd better have a word with him. - What is it, inkosi? - We will not move. - Max, we're gonna have to carry them. - [Max] All right fellas, pick him up. Put him on the truck. (argumentative chatter) - I'm sorry it had to be this way. - I hate this way; progress. All I see of our future is suffering. - But you still have friends. People who care for you. Go with them, Samson. See that they're settled. - [Max] All right, close 'em up, let's move! (trucks rev) - Is your precious dam really worth all this? (tense atmosphere music) - Come on. I'll take you to your home. (singing in foreign language) - My god, what a mess the place is in. Oh, if you'll just leave them down there. - [Joe] Right. - Thank you. Father. Koshi? Where's my father? - He's asleep. - Father? Father, wake up. - What are you doing here? - I got your letter papa, you asked me to come. - I told you to come! Your place is here in this house. Who's he? What's he doing here? - My car broke down, he drove me here. - What's he expect in return? Koshi! Lunch! - It's very good. - Cover your shoulders. You're English? - My parents were, I was born here. - You're English. And if trouble starts, you'll run back to England. - Trouble? - It's coming. Sooner than you think. It'll just be up against the keffas. The blacks. Your kind will take the coward's way out. - [Suzanne] Father please. - Suzie, come with me! - No father. - Suzie! Suzie! Come. - Yes father? - I don't want you to see this man again. - That's ridiculous. - I can see how he looks at you. You're not to see him again! When was the last time you went to church? - But that's between me and God. - No! It's between you and me. Is this the way you show respect? Hellfire! That's the reward for insolence and fornication! - You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. Please wait outside, I'll be with you in a minute. (dramatic atmosphere music) He's asleep. - You sure you want to stay? - That's correct. - I better be on my way. (truck revs) (thunder booms) - Are you writing a book, inkosi? - A letter. I don't know what to say. - A message to a loved one must come from the heart, inkosi. - I'm only writing to thank her for the picture, for god's sake. - Oh, well then it's easy. You just say thank you. - Has that kettle boiled yet? - Oh yes, it's coming just now. - [Max] Calling Native Commissioner Mahoney! Calling Native Commissioner Mahoney, over! - Mahoney here, over. - [Max] Joe, it's Max! How are you? Over. - Wet. How are you? Over. - [Max] Funny man. Listen Joe, we've got serious flooding all along the river. We can't spare anyone from our section and you're the nearest to (mumbles). Can you make it? Over. - I'm on my way, Max. Roger and out.

Here, take these chickens too. It'll be a while before you find something better to eat. - Mambo, how am I going to cook this? There's no place for fire here. - Here, wait a minute. Take this lighter. You do that. Well when it's dry it will work. - Thank you, mambo. (motor revs) (singing in foreign language) - Mambo. - What is that? - [Samson] Insango. - Insango? - Insango. - Insango. (coughs) (sings in foreign language) (speaks in foreign language) - What? - [Samson] Pass it over. - Oh. That's good. - Good. (laughing) It's good. It's good. - It's good. - It's good. - Yeah. (laughing) (birds chirping) (groans) (screams) Samson! - Joe! (tense atmosphere music) Mamba! (loud explosion) Mamba! Mamba! (screams) Mamba! (loud explosion) (ominous atmosphere music) (coughs) (vomits) (gunshots) Come on, Joe. Come, come. Get on board. Okay Joe, you're gonna be all right. (shouting in foreign language) (ominous atmosphere music) (chanting and singing in foreign language) - [Elder Voiceover] This is sacred land. - [Samson Voiceover] Their spirit will be drowned by the waters. - No! - [Elder Voiceover] I hate this way; progress. All I see of our future is suffering. - No, no! No! No! No, no, no! (screams) - [Joe Voiceover] But you still have friends. People who care for you. (screams) (ritual chanting) - No! No! (pained groaning) - Joe. Joe, it's me Suzie. - He can't hear you, kosessa. - My god. Get him outside. Into the light. (speaks in foreign language) - Where am I? - Samson's village. He brought you here. I'm so glad you're awake. - How long have I been here? - About a week. Do you remember anything? - No. - It's probably just as well. (loud clucking) (gasps) It's all right. It's all right. (speaks foreign language) - It's good, Joe. Tomorrow you should be able to walk. But you're gonna have to move, mambo. You're gonna have to try. Or your leg will wither. - You all right? - Yeah. - We should be planning to leave soon. - Yeah, I'm ready to leave. I'm going to live in England. I just don't think I'm able to stay in Africa. - But you're needed here. These feelings will pass. - No they won't. My leg will heal, yes, but... You see, all my life, I believed that if you do the right things, honestly, that everything will turn out for the best. Your father was right about me. - Can I come with you, inkosi? - I'm sorry Samson, I can't take you with me. I don't really have any plans for myself. - Will you be gone a long time? - I don't know. - [Samson] Are you going to have tea with the Queen? - (laughs) I don't know the Queen. (laughing) - But you spoke on her behalf for us. - Well maybe I will meet her then. (chuckles) - I have something for you. It came from the crocodile that almost killed you. I had the witch doctor make this charm. It will protect you. - Thank you. - Oh. He also made this ring for me. And now we are like brothers. (chuckles) Good luck, inkosi.

Went to bed with their socks on. - Shhh! (church organ music) - Hey man, you should check yourself into a hospital. Great beds, beautiful nurses. It sure beats walking the streets. - I'm fine, I'm just a little shaken up. Thank you for helping me. - It's not having no money that gets me down. It's the bloody weather. Ain't you got no people to go to? - People? I walked out on my people. I helped destroy a whole way of life. - Doesn't matter how much trouble you have. You should somehow get back to your roots.

Did he? (dog barking) (scattered yelling) You all right? - What the fuck is going on? - Half the farms around here have been torched. There are vigilante groups springing up everywhere. They don't take kindly to black sympathizers. - This used to be such a quiet place. - How long have you been away? - I've been overseas about four years. - (chuckles) Four years is a fucking lifetime in this country. - Which way are you heading? - North. - Good, so am I. You a farmer? - More a shepard. You got any water left in that water bottle of yours? - No. - Well my son, it's time to point Percy in the pot. (urinates) My name is Ballinger. - I'm Joe Mahoney. - I'm afraid I can't give you my hand, Joe. I'm finished. Well I hope you find her. Most of the farmers around here who sold up, they're gone. - I'm sorry about the car. Thanks for the ride. - Thanks for the company. (dramatic piano music) - Excuse me. Is Miss de Villiers at home? (speaks in foreign language) I had no idea that things had got so bad. - You've missed a lot. The country's in chaos. How is it in the old country? - Fine. If you don't mind taking orders from dull, gray people who go to work under a dull, gray sky. And think they're still running an empire. The sort of people who have taken the wealth and destroyed the culture of half the world and think they still have something to be proud of. - So you had a good time then? - I've missed you you know. I brought you the most precious thing I could find in England. It survived the journey. - Thank you. - You have to shake it. Dandruff in a bottle. (Suzanna laughs) - It's snow. - Is that Samson? Excuse me. Samson? - Mamba! (laughing) - [Joe] What are you doing here? - [Samson] I've been working here. Ever since her father died. (uplifting atmosphere music) - [Newscaster] This is the World Service of the BBC. Early today, the Prime Minister, the right honorable Herald Wilson, had further talks with the Rhodesian Prime Minister, Mr. Ian Smith. A spokesman at #10 Downing Street said Mr. Wilson has repeated his message to the people of Rhodesia that any attempt to form a breakaway government, or establish independence, would result in the most stringent sanctions being enforced across the board. In America, the black Civil Rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King has been speaking out in protest-- - [Suzanna] Hurry, it's getting away! (laughing) I thought you were a great hunter. - Dammit! - [Suzanna] Come on chicken, run for your life! - Come here you! (laughing) Don't let it get away! (laughing) (metal clangs, glass shatters) - Oh god. Oh no, don't hurt it. I'll make pumpkin pie instead tonight. (loud thunk) - Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for coming. We'd like to kick off this morning's auction with a blessing by the Reverend Ian Ballinger. - Today is a sad day. For all of us. Jack and Elsie Walters are selling up. And leaving our small community. I'm sure that we all wish them luck back in the old country, and pray that they may find happiness in their new home (mumbles) in Sussex. Dear God, look down upon your servants and bless them. Bless Jack and Elsie, who are selling their stock, and grant them a fair price for them. Bless the bidders so they may enjoy the fruits of your bounty. In God we trust. The rest of us thank cash. (laughing) - All right, ladies and gentlemen. Let's kick off this morning with the rules which you all should know. - You're full of surprises. - I go where the people are. You should know that. Besides, I find I get a bigger flock here at these auctions than I do at my own church. What about you? You thinking of taking up farming? - Something like that. - Well why not? I know it's a buyer's market at the moment. All the old fellas are selling up their stock and going aboard, I think it's crazy. - But why? The British government's not gonna let the situation get out of hand. - Haven't you heard? The government is declaring independence against Britain. - They wouldn't dare. - They'll tear the country apart rather than give the black man the vote. You see, they're so bloody frightened of the Russians that they're prepared to put the clock back some 50 years. - That's breaking the law. - They're breaking people's hearts. The irony is that it won't stop the Communists coming in through the open door. You know that? - This is my lot. - Hey. You found her then? - Yes. I did. - [Auctioneer] 150 anywhere? - 150. - 200 pound. - 200, thank you. Do I hear 250? - 225. - 250. (crowd mutters) - 300. - 350. - Four. - 450. - 500. - And 50. - 550 here. All right, 550. Do I hear anymore bids? Going once at 550! Going twice! Come on gentlemen, anymore bids? - 600 pounds. - Sold to Mr... - Mahoney. - Mahoney. Mahoney, 600 pounds. (applause) Right, our next lot. - Attaboy, Joe. I hope you know what you're doing. - I think so. - Yes, well if you're really set on farming, I'd like you to accept a gift. - A gift? - Yes, it's already arranged. - You leave that alone! You shouldn't even be in here. - This auction is open to everybody. - You walk in and buy up decent people's belongings. This auction's for whites only! - It is for anyone that can afford it. - Don't answer her back, you ignorance keffa. - Where do they get their money from? That's what I want to know. Who gives it to them? - They steal it. Don't you, keffa? - Go on back to your stinking keffa bars! And leave us alone. (tense atmosphere music) (loud arguing) - Why is there always trouble? Somebody's gonna get hurt here! Break it up, break it up will you? (woman screams) - [Farmer] Give him room! (chuckles) - God's work's... Now done. (dramatic atmosphere music) (cows mooing) - Where did you get him? He's beautiful. - He's a gift. From a friend. - What happened? - There was an accident and... No, it wasn't an accident. The same friend was killed trying to stop a stupid fight. - Are you hurt? - No no no, I wasn't involved. - Where's Samson? - Well I gave him a couple of days off until the whole thing blows over. (dramatic atmosphere music) (dramatic piano music) (ominous atmosphere music) - We've been looking for you, Samson Snhlova. Do you know where your people are Samson? - In their homes or at work. - Mmm-mmm. Your friends from the mines are all in jail. Some are waiting to be hanged. Because they dare raise their hands against white men. You volunteered to join the party didn't you? - Your people in the mines made me join. - The party helped you when you were in trouble. Now the party asks for your favor in return. You must decide whether you're with us. You must show us that you believe. You'll burn the house of the white woman that you work for. - Why? (speaking in foreign language) (groans) - Samson knows what he must do. (birds chirping) - Samson? Samson? - Yes, inkosi? - You all right? - Yeah, all good. - Suzie and I are going away for a couple of days. Look after the place. We'll see you on Friday. - [Samson] Okay, inkosi. - Is he all right? - Yeah. He's a bit hungover. - Sergeant! - Mr. Mahoney. (laughing) - I thought you retired. - They won't let me go, sir. Too much trouble. - So what's all the excitement about today? - We caught two terrorists in the area last night, sir. - Did you? Well done. Difficult times. Look, I'm staying at the de Villiers farm. We're off to Victoria Falls for a couple of days. Can you get someone to look in on the place while we're away? - I'll do it myself, sir. - Wonderful. It's good to see you. (car revs) (birds and crickets chirping) (ominous atmosphere music) - Hold it! And stand still! Get that fire out! Lie on the ground. - Is this Samson Snhlova's cell? - Yes, mamba. - Open it will you? - Thanks Reggie. Cigarette? - Am I going to die? - The judge is considering his verdict. - Bet he'll find me guilty. - On the evidence presented, he's got no choice. - But how could I have hurt you if you were not at home? - 'Cause that's the law! But you still have the right of appeal. Look at me Samson. Come on! Were you forced to throw that bomb? - What difference does it make? - Because if you were pressured into throwing that bomb and you really didn't mean to do any harm, then there's a chance that you won't be hanged. Do you understand? - [Soldier] Bring out the accused! - I understand. - Now tell him the truth, I told you. Tell him the truth and you may not die. - Come on, let's get a move on! - Samson Snhlova, you have been duly convicted of the crime of contravening Section 37, subsection one, subparagraph B, subsection one, of the Law and Order Maintenance Act, Chapter 39, as amended. - Do you wish to say anything before the sentence of death is passed upon you according to law? - Say it. - Yeah, inkosi. - What is it? - Only this. I threw the bomb of my own free will. (gasps and murmurs) (gavel bangs) - Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye! All persons are charged to stand and keep strict silence while the sentence of death is passed upon the prisoner at the bar. - The sentence of this court is that you be returned to custody, and that the sentence of death be executed upon you according to law. May God have mercy on your soul. (dramatic atmosphere music) - I could've told the judge that I was supposed to throw the bomb. But who is really to blame? You know, the boys here say that the British government are sending in soldiers to free us. I think we shall fight back. - And what'll you do? - Me? I'd rather be dead. - Look, is there anything you want us to do before you... - No. - [Joe] What about your wives and children? - My wives. My children. My younger brother will inherit them. There's only one thing I'd really like. That is to be buried at my village. - Yes, of course. (Samson chuckles) - I was just thinking about all the good times we've had together. - Yes, they were good. You taught me to see things differently. Oh Christ! - I have something for you, kosessa. I'd like you to keep it for me. You're my friends. My friends. There's nothing more to say. - Guard! (cell door locks) (dramatic atmosphere music) (shouting in foreign language) (screaming) - Oh my god! Stay in the car! (suspenseful atmosphere music) oh god, get down! Lie on the ground! Sergeant. - Hold my hand. I'm dying. (dramatic orchestra music) - Samson Snhlova. I have here a warrant for the execution upon you by the sentence of death. Go easy, gentle.
