(DOORBELL RINGS) (DOOR BUZZES, OPENS) How you doing, Petey? Fine. And you? I'm good. Nervous? Yeah? All right. How we doing? MAN: Hey, what's up? MOE: Take it easy. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (CAR HORNS HONKING) (DIALOGUE INAUDIBLE) Everything cool? Everything's fuckin' beautiful. (CHUCKLES) (EXHALES SHARPLY) You know what this fuckin' means for us. When he brings you in, we're taking it all over, Moe. He's got no choice. Nobody can handle the weight he's got coming through. You never know. (SIGHS) He can be resourceful. No. No way. Not with the bust, Nektalov gettin' popped, I'm his only option. You let him do the talkin'. You have something he wants, right? Yeah, you. Well, that means us. I told him I don't do nothin' without you. Moe, you're a fucking godsend. Hey, Unc. Hey, can you believe this view? You can't make it on those streets, you can't make it anywhere in the world. SKUNK: So you're really gonna buy this building? Ah. We do this right, it will be fully legitimate. Our money mixed with theirs. I'll be working for the city. Congressman Fried is a partner. There is no going back. SKUNK: Yeah, all right. PERICO: You get it done? Uh, here. Good. So what do you say about $2 million a day for the next two weeks, huh? That's $20 million, yeah? Not a problem. And you don't even think about it, like it's nothing, huh? No. No, it's something. Something big. I mean, you did say these last few times were just a test, right? Okay. So you start making drops today, huh? All right. Yeah. MOE: Twenty million in 10 days. There's gonna be too much traffic coming through my place. And what do you propose? Bobby? So they text us a location, we pick them up, we drop them off. They leave the money behind. So you not fuck this up and I put a little more in your lap, huh? Well, no disrespect, but I fuck this up, and I don't think it'll matter. Hey, just use this fucking head! All right. "Use your fuckin' head." Can you believe that shit? Twenty mil means you and I split $2 mil, all right? That's all that matters. (INDISTINCT ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PA) (LINE RINGING) MANNING: Hey, you need to put a pause on whatever you got going till I get back to you. MAN: All right. Later then. MOE: All right, where's the next pickup? Bushwick. Whoa. Hold up, hold up, hold up. Hello? PERICO: (ON PHONE) The girl you are seeing, I don't want you dating her anymore. Well, what about the suit that I borrowed for the date? You want me to bring it back? Well, I have flu, nasty virus. So stay away from me for now. Okay. Yeah, you got it. You got it. Hey, it's a beautiful day today out. Maybe you go to the zoo. MOE: What? He... (EXCLAIMS) He just canceled the rest of the pickups. What the fuck. Why? I don't know. He just wants us to hold the money and stay the fuck away from the garage until tomorrow. I mean, what if it's all lost, man? This was our chance to start something on our own. All right, all right. Calm down. This has to happen. All he did was delay things until tomorrow, right? I knew he would do this. He doesn't trust you. Why wouldn't he trust me? He doesn't trust me, so he can't fuckin' trust you! Fuck him! Hold on. How much you think we have in the trunk? (KEYS JINGLE, CLATTER) We have this money until tomorrow. What's the harm in putting it to good use? You wanna take money that belongs to God knows who, that your uncle is laundering through me, that I am risking everything on, and use it on a drug deal? It's not a drug deal, drug deal, man. It's pure fuckin' coke at half the price. It's a drug deal. And Fedex is putting up half the money, so he's got just as much on the line. I ain't doin' it, man. Partners, my ass. I knew it... Partners listen to one another, and you ain't listening. No, I'm listening. I get it. It's too risky for you. So you know what, go back to your diamond district where it's safe. My uncle called me. I'm the one holding his money. Anything goes wrong, you're off the hook. I'm not off the hook when you're dead. It's worth the risk. I have nothing, bro. I ain't you. Come on. Half the time I can't even find you. I know you been making moves on your own. That ain't true, man. Why you always disappearing and shit? I've known you for two years. Not once have I ever not answered your call. Every other night, I got no idea where the fuck you are. Listen, you got your other business. I get that. That's cool. So, yeah, I wanna make moves on my own for once. I'll call you after I sell this shit. Just stop. You're not stopping me, Moe. Yeah, I can see that, you stubborn fuck. Jesus. God damn it, man. Fuck. (SIGHS) We do this, we're not using Fedex's money. You won't be sorry. You'll see. You said you have a buyer? Waxman's son. Ritchie. All right, call him. We don't pull the trigger unless he has the cash. (SKUNK TALKING INDISTINCTLY) (LINE RINGING) Hey. WOMAN: Hey. You on your way? No. I'm not gonna make it. What do you mean? Everyone is expecting you. Yeah, I know. Just, I... Look, I'll make it up to you. I just can't leave right now. (SIGHS) Moe, when is this going to end? Soon. Look, don't let this get you down, okay? Just have a nice night with your friends, and I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) SKUNK: Look at this guy. He cracks me up. MOE: Hope he goes for this. Hey, Skunkie. What's up, man? (SKUNK CHUCKLES) SKUNK: What's up? Yeah man, how you doing? RITCHIE: Hey, man. You fuckin' ready? RITCHIE: So they said they'd call us with a location in an hour. Same Nigerian? Yeah, dude. Debo. SKUNK: Debo. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, quick question, though. Are you guys good taking it like this? I don't know how you guys usually, you know, pack your money and shit. I'm not gonna need your money. What's that supposed to mean? How long has your father owned this place? Twenty years. What has that got to do with anything, though? Well, everything. You've got more money in that box than your father has made in his entire life. You wanna risk it on a fuckin' drug deal? He's right, man. Skunkie, you gonna do this to me, man? I brought this shit to you, dude! You'll get 10% of what we clear. MOE: That's a sweet deal for you. You sit here all safe and cozy, risk-free, and you make, what, 60G? Sixty? You know you guys are buying this half-price, right? It is what it is. You think I'm holding out, you take the deal down yourself. Skunkie, come on, man. You know I don't have the money to do this on my own. Your call. (SIGHS) All right, man. Fuck. So what am I supposed to tell Debo when he calls, "I'm not coming"? Listen. Regardless of what happens, we meet tonight at the club at 2:00. (SIGHS) Fuck. Aw, don't look so sad. Your father would be proud. RITCHIE: Oh, yeah. Fuck, yeah. (DOOR CLOSES) Fuck! MOE: I don't like this, man. Who set the deal out here? SKUNK: You worry too much, man. Fedex and Debo are our boys. You Debo? Yeah, man. I'm Debo. All right, come on. Let's do this. (PUNCTURES PLASTIC) You're gonna dip? (SNIFFS) (SNIFFS) SKUNK: We're good. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Yo, we good? (MAN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) This is a one-time deal. I need to make sure everything is right. (TIRES SCREECHING) SKUNK: Fuck! (MAN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) SKUNK: Fucking cops! (MAN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) (MAN SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) MAN 1: (IN ENGLISH) Come on, let's go. Let's go! Grab a kilo, man. OFFICER: Hey, yo, Afrika Bambaataa. Get the fuck outta here! MAN 1: Yeah, be cool, man. We're goin', we're goin'. SKUNK: What is he fucking doing? OFFICER: Come on, let's go. Move it! SKUNK: Where the fuck are they going? (ENGINE STARTING) (MAN LAUGHS) Drop your fuckin' weapons and come out! Yo, you two go around... Come out and drop your fuckin' weapons! Be smart, and don't get yourselves in any more shit! They're gonna take my uncle's money. We're fuckin' dead, man! No, wait, wait. What the fuck are we gonna do? If this is a bust, where's your backup? How come we don't hear no sirens? All right, all right. Let's talk about this. Yeah, yeah. Fuckin' dirty fucks. Come on, bro. You got nowhere to go. Drop your weapons and let's talk this out. Fuck you! You think we're gonna trust dirty fuckin' pigs? You got not a chance in hell of leaving alive unless you motherfuckers come out now! - (GUN FIRES) - (MEN EXCLAIM) Shit. (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) MAN: Yo, these motherfuckers got a shooter! Leon, you good? SKUNK: Man, it's Suzuki. He's layin' cover. Let's go. (GUNFIRE CONTINUES) Fuck. MAN: Don't let these fucking guys go! (GRUNTS) MAN: Yo, yo, these motherfuckers are leaving. Let's go! Motherfuckers! Fuck! (ENGINE REVVING) Fuck. Shit! Yo, Fedex. It was a setup. Don't say shit! 2:00 a.m., same place. Don't you fuckin' say it. Go! Go! Gun it! Fuck! Fuck! Drive! Fuck! Yo, we lost the cops. We lost the cops. Whoa! Whoa! MOE: What the fuck? (SKUNK WHIMPERS) Where are we? (METAL CREAKS, THUDS) (STRAINS, GRUNTS) Moe. (PANTING) Moe! Go. We gotta go. Go, go, go, go! Come on. We gotta go. Come on. Fuck. Come on. No, no, no. We gotta go. We gotta go! Suzuki's here. MOE: I can't fucking see. I can't fuckin' see. It's all right. Come on. Come on. Go, go! Just breathe. We need to get this motherfucker to a hospital. Take the tunnel to Jersey, man! (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) We gotta talk. We got a big fuckin' problem. We lost a load. What? What about the money? We lost all of it. Listen to me. If you don't get every ounce of that product back to evidence, we're finished. How much time can you buy us? Monday. At the latest. Okay, I got it. It's a nice tie. Asshole. SKUNK: (ECHOING) We were in the same car. How is he? NURSE: He's okay. He sustained a bad concussion. His MRI was okay, but the doctor wants to check him anyway. And he needs to fill out a report before he's discharged. SKUNK: What kind of report? He had some unusual items on his person. Well, what do you mean? What... Like what? Like a gun. A gun? The police are on their way to take a report. Actually, it'd be good if you stayed till they arrive. (CLEARS THROAT) Thank you. Moe? Moe, can you hear me? (ECHOING) Moe! Moe, can you hear me? Come on, come on. Look, we can't stay here. (ECHOING) Where are your clothes? Come on, come on. (GROANS) Where am I? What's going on? Moe, come on. Up we go, up we go. Let's go. Don't fall over. Gotta get your IV. Come on. (SKUNK GRUNTING) Oh, God, it hurts. Where we... Where we goin'? We'll get you some help. Just hang on. (RETCHES) Oh, shit! (MOE COUGHS) (GROANING, BREATHING HEAVILY) You okay? All right, relax, just relax. I had to take you outta that hospital! Have some water. Moe... Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! (CAR HORN BLARING) (GROANS) (SIRENS BLARING) DR. JERRY: So, what is the last thing you remember? (SIGHS) I don't know. What's your name? Moe, I think. That's what he's been calling me. DR. JERRY: That's okay, that's all right. You're my doctor? Not unless you're pregnant. We're friends. What do you think? He needs to see a neurologist, man. So there's no danger in keeping him out of the hospital? He should be fine. I mean, I'm not an expert, but I would think everything but the events just right before the accident should come back. And for now, just reintroduce him to old familiar things, apartment, family, friends. What if I can't do that right now? Well, there's gotta be something you can show him. My boy Nick hooked us up with this here. All right, all right. This bring anything back? You gotta be fuckin' kidding me. How about... How about this? This jog your memory? We took this coke from dirty fuckin' cops, Moe. They were trying to kill us. And before we unload it and leave, my uncle might decide it's easier to kill us himself than clean up the fuckin' mess. I'm a fuckin' drug dealer? No, you're a jeweler and a money launderer. Well, how does jeweler lead to this? We're friends, and I needed your help. We unload this, we walk away with $3 million cash. We gotta go, man. We told Fedex 2:00 a.m. Come on, come on, come on. We gotta go. No, no, no, no. I wanna see where I live first. You don't think I'd take you there if it was safe? These cops could be there waiting for us. Yeah, well, I gotta see something other than money and drugs! You will. We're meeting Fedex somewhere you been a thousand times before. You know people there. You just gotta trust me. Who the fuck are you? Your friend! You fuckin' lie! Why would I make this shit up? Come on, man. Put the gun down. I'm your friend. (SCREAMS) (GUN FIRES) Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck, man? You don't think people just heard that and called the fucking cops? Fuck! (MOE BREATHING HEAVILY) How? I don't know how. I slid open the terrace door, and then the glass exploded. No, Jimmy... Jimmy, please. Fine. Send up a key for a new room. Taking care of you, right? You're like my brother, man. If you don't feel that in your gut, then I can't talk you into it. MOE: I feel like I'm runnin', hidin'. We are runnin' from this city, my uncle, dirty fuckin' cops. You're not going crazy. The feeling is real. How you doin'? Hello. How are you? This is your place? Yes. How can I help you? A man we're trying to identify may have been in here earlier. So me and my partner here wanna see your surveillance footage. Yeah, sure. My son can help you. He's in the cooler, stocking. (OWNER SPEAKING HINDI) Let me get a half-pint. Uh, Jack? No, no, the 12 here's good. Long day, huh? Yeah. Long fuckin' day. Yeah, tell me about it. So, your son, he's very lucky. He avoided a murder earlier today. Who? My son? Yeah. Murdered? Yeah, he was supposed to be at a drug deal. Had he shown up, he'd have been robbed and killed. The man you're looking for? Yeah. Yeah, I'm afraid so. This is why we need your help, so we can apprehend the bad people, make sure your son stays safe. Rajid, these police need the video from today. What's up, man? You must be Fedex. My name's Rajid. Mmm-mmm. You really wanna go down that road? You wouldn't happen to have one of those... One of those Internet surveillance systems, would you? It'd help us speed things up. No, no. We... It is too expensive. We only have the videotape. Really? That's good. FEDEX: No! (BODY THUDS) Sit the fuck down! You fucked up. Please, please, please! Hey! Come on, man. You should've showed up to the fuckin' deal like you were supposed to. No! I'll tell you where they are, man. You motherfucker. Hey, please, man, please. I know where they'll be! I know where they'll be! (GROANS) SKUNK: Liverpool, what's up, man? (DANCE MUSIC PLAYING) SKUNK: Suzuki? SUZUKI: Yo, what up? Moe. How you feeling, man? MOE: This the guy from the deal? Yeah, yeah. You see? It's all coming back. His memory got a little screwed up. "A little"? How little? SKUNK: Can't remember a thing. SUZUKI: Damn. Fucked up. We emptied your pockets before leaving you at the ER. You know this motherfucker had a revolver strapped on his ankle? SUZUKI: Did they find it? Yeah. We barely got out before the cops got there. Yo, you think Fedex gonna show? SKUNK: He better. He's got a lot of explaining to do. Fuckin' idiot. SUZUKI: Got these motherfuckers' coke and their money. What else you want? SKUNK: Could you imagine, had he shown up alone? Yo, what was that Nigerian from the deal? What was his name? Debo. Hey, what good is that gonna do us? You're gonna drive yourself crazy. We're pushing unloading the product until after I meet with my uncle. SUZUKI: All right, I got you. Fuck, my head is killing me. Here. This'll help. It'll help. (SIGHS) (SNIFFS) (ECHOING) How's that? Hey. Hey. So you're not gonna share with me tonight? Do you know me? Yeah. [moaning] (DANCE MUSIC CONTINUES PLAYING) Yo. What? You know that guy? Yo, we know everybody! Oh, you rolling along now. (BOTH GRUNTING) Fuck. I'm a cop! How the fuck do you know me? I don't, I swear! Huh? Why the fuck you following me? Just following orders. I swear. I'm sorry. I blew my cover. It's okay, man. We know who they are. It's only a matter of time. We'll find 'em. Everything under control over here, fellas? Yeah, we're good, we're good. Keep driving. Why we being so quiet on this? We think they may be involved with some dirty blues. What, in our department? Could be, but it stays with us, okay? Yeah. Good. We got something. What up? Yeah, bartender said the Asian they were hanging with, knows 'em. Kenjo Suzuki. Checked his name. Drives an X3 with a Chinatown address. That's him right there. That's our shooter. Fuckin' chinks. So you know this motherfucker? SKUNK: So, that's Petey, this is Alonzo, Cheech, and that's Nico. He's a liar, and he'll fuck anything that moves. So... (MAN LAUGHS) You know, watch yourself around him. Hey, Moe! You got that for me? Again with this 19-year-old, huh? MAN: She's 20. You promised to get him a ring for this girl. Tell him you're working on it. She's 20, guys, 20. I'm working on it. How you doing? I'll be right back. Don't leave. Oh, man, this fucking guy. Listen, look. I'm gonna be right back, okay? You guys, you fill him in on things? MAN: Yeah, we'll fill him in. Cool, man? I'm cool. You're fucking good. What happened? Hey, Genie. Is my uncle busy? Some poor guy is in there with his daughter. Says she was molested by one of the drivers at the charity carwash. You remember that girl running around topless with her boobs jumping up and down underneath the soapsuds? You should see her now. Who did you tell? Janet. She told my sister. But I told my dad it was one of the drivers. So he doesn't know about you. Are you mad at me? Hmm. (INTERCOM RINGING) Yeah? GENIE: Bobby's here. Have him wait. PETEY: So you don't remember? Not a thing? You don't remember anything about me? What, are you fuckin' stupid? I'm your father. Stupid? I'm fucking with you. All right, all right, chill. (LAUGHS) I'm fucking with you, bro. I'm fuckin' with you. You and me, we were lovers, dude. You don't remember this? Hey! Whoa! What the fuck is wrong with you, man? (ALL SHOUTING) SKUNK: Don't fight! Don't fight. What the fuck are you doing, man? Bobby, let's talk inside. Come on. Come on! All right. PERICO: So take my money and set up side deal where we make... A million. Even after I call and tell you everything is off. Dumb shit! How are you gonna do pickups with the cops after you? How's your friend gonna wash it when he can't remember how to wipe his own ass? Huh? (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Hello? MANNING: (ON PHONE) Can you talk? Yeah. I'm alone. Go ahead. There's nothing on your nephew. No warrants, no APBs, nothing. If the cops are after him, they don't want anyone knowing about it. But you may have a bigger problem. PERICO: Moe Diamond? No. I checked again. Diamond's clean. So what's the problem? It's you. Someone submitted an FBI background check. Who? Congressman Fried's office. That's not problem. The prick's just doing his job. You working with Fried? Hey... I'll call you back in ten. Answer. MANNING: All right. I have Congressman checking up on me. I have the biggest bank in New York financing my real estate deal. And you're out there risking it all on a two-bit drug deal! This is my mess, and I'll clean it up. None of it comes back to you. You are not cleaning up a thing. You bring back my money, and you leave New York forever. I'll let you keep the product. But that means I'm financing your lives. And I get a cut for life. That's fair. You're my sister's son, so I'll let this go. But if you don't leave like you're supposed to... We're leaving today. SKUNK: So, Unc, you know... You know, like, with the town car, I had to turn that in, so... You think I could borrow a car? No, you can't borrow a car. You can have one. Thank you. Whoo! I like this one. MOE: Yeah, this one's nice. Ugh! Man, I think you lost your taste along with your memory. What, you don't like it? Uh... (SIGHS) All right, man. I'll let you pick it. But, you know, it's hot in Miami. You better hope it has AC. I wanna go to my apartment first. That's not a good idea. We're not going there, man. I'll go alone. Get in the fuckin' car. You're not goin' alone, all right? Jesus Christ. This is not a good idea. All right, all right! Get off! Okay, okay, exit five. Yeah, yeah. Park up here. We'll walk around the block. It's the red building. Number 37. All right, you walk in first. I'll make sure no one follows. What's the matter? I was hoping I'd recognize it. (SHUSHING) (LOCK CLICKS) (METAL CLANGS IN DISTANCE) Did you hear that? (FLOORBOARDS CREAK) (SHUSHING) Don't you... Fuck! (GASPS) Oh, my God! Lola, what the fuck? Moe? You're pregnant? Moe, what the fuck is this? What happened to you? I can't believe you would hide this shit from me. What did you fuckin' get him into? He doesn't know you, Lola. He doesn't know anything. He got his head all busted up. No, don't tell me he's serious. You don't know who I am? SKUNK: Is that Moe's? No. I'm just in his apartment half-naked for fun! Get the fuck out! What? (SIGHS) Oh, I hate when you do that. Hey, man, why wouldn't you tell me about this? LOLA: Because he hates the way you live. We're leaving New York, Bobby. Is she for real? Will you two shut the fuck up? Yo, you gotta leave, man. This is so fucked. Hey, listen, you wanna bring her? Cool, but we can't stay here! I'm going to get Suzuki. Be ready when I'm back. Baby, he's gone. Are you in trouble? What's happening? What's going on? What? (EXHALES HEAVILY) I can't remember. What? What the fuck? Are you doing this to protect me? Can you please tell me? Can you just... Why wouldn't I tell Skunk about you? I knew Skunk before I met you. And when we started seeing each other, you didn't want him to know. Why? Because you thought they would hurt me to get to you. No, he saved my life. Why would he do that? No, not Skunk. His uncle. Perico? Yes. Yes, and you wouldn't tell me much. I tried to read between the lines, but you would just blow up and say things. Like what? Like, um... "I know he killed Jimmy." Like, he's gonna kill Skunk, that he'd be next. And I didn't understand it, why... You hated him so much, yet you did everything you could to get closer to him. MOE: I feel nothing. (VOICE BREAKING) I don't fuckin' feel it. (SIGHS) I thought coming here would help. And I don't feel anything. No. No, don't say that. You're so wrong. This is everything. God... You have everything you need in here. You knew that. No, I don't. I want you to feel this. Do you remember? That's my baby. (SOBS) (LINE RINGING) SUZUKI: Yo. Yo, man, let's meet at Moe's in an hour. We'll head out from there. (HORN HONKING) Hey, Moe! Let's hit the road! Hey, I'm gonna tell him to come up. We gotta figure this out. SKUNK: Fuck! DUFFY: Freeze, you motherfucker! (GUN FIRES) I have a gun. Fuck! The other one's inside! LOLA: Moe, what's going on? MOE: We gotta go. Fuck, come on. (LOLA GRUNTS) (GUN FIRING) You messed with the wrong motherfucker today! Moe! Run! Fuckin' resisting, you motherfucker! SKUNK: Fuck you! Moe! Moe! Get in the fuckin' car, I said! Fuck! Listen to me. Stop fucking with me, all right? Or I'll leave your motherfuckin' brains in the back of this fuckin' car. Ready? (HANDCUFFS CLICKING) (SKUNK WHIMPERS) Fuck! (LOLA GASPS) (ENGINE STARTING) (LOLA EXCLAIMS) (DOOR BANGS) (LOLA GASPS) Yo! Out of the kitchen! Out the fuckin' kitchen! Police! Get everybody out the restaurant. Out the fuckin' kitchen! Get outta here! Police! I know you motherfuckers are in here. Come the fuck out now. Come out now! You don't want your girl to get fuckin' shot! We already got your boy! Hey! Hands up! Let me see your fuckin' hands! (LOLA GASPS, WHIMPERS) Moe? MOE: We need a hospital! Someone help us! We need a doctor! NURSE: What have we got? She was shot. LOLA: Moe, where are you? MOE: I'm here, right here. I'm right here, baby, I'm right here. I'm here. You'll be okay, baby. You're okay. (GRUNTING) Martinez! (SUZUKI COUGHING, GROANING) (MONITOR BEEPING STEADILY) (BEEPING INTENSIFIES) (MONITOR FLATLINES) (INAUDIBLE) Sir, you can't be in here. (GROANING) (CHUCKLES) You think you're a real big shot messing with weights. (CHUCKLES) You know, you little fuck boy, there's a girl named Stacy from New Rochelle. She's got the most beautiful feet, and I've been trying to tap that ass since community college. And I think I was gonna hit it tonight, but I had to cancel. Because you got us out here running around playing basketball like some fuckin' monkeys. Now tell me where to find my product and where your friend is! Quit playing fuckin' games with me! Fuckin' guy. (MOANING, WHIMPERING) Moe! Chill out, man. Hey, cool off, man. Stay the fuck back, all right? You wanna fucking die? MAN: Petey! Where the fuck you going, man? This ain't between me and you, all right? I just wanna talk to Perico. Talk to me, motherfucker. I'm right here. (GRUNTS) Put the fuckin' gun down. You motherfucker. PERICO: I made this really simple. Bring back my money and you two leave town. Now where is that stupid fucking nephew of mine, huh? Cops from the deal, they took him. He couldn't get away. (MUTTERING INCOHERENTLY) Where is the product? I have it. You have it. Good. I understand you are Bobby's friend. But I'm afraid this no longer concerns you, okay? They took the only two people I know. That's all that fuckin' concerns me! Hey, look. They find out he's my nephew, they will come looking for deal. We give them back their product, and this thing works itself out. Understand? They killed my girl and my baby. How the fuck do you think that's gonna work itself out? What the fuck! Fuck you! Fuck! Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Fuck you! Where is the product and my money? Let's do it my way! All right, my way! Your way? Your way, your fucking way! You want to hold my money ransom? I don't want your fuckin' money, all right? I could have left with the money and the fuckin' coke. I need to find these cops. (EXCLAIMS) These cops can fuck you in your ass! You dumb fuck! You don't fight dirty cops! You buy them, idiot! I'm no fuckin' idiot. They dragged your nephew through the street like a dog. You wanna wait for them to come to you with a deal? What kind of man are you? Huh? Hey. (GRUNTS) MOE: (GRUNTS) Fuck. Well, okay. I'll help you find them. And you bring back my money and their coke, hmm? Skunk no longer works for you. So he can work for you? So he can do what he wants. Well, okay. Bring me these dirty pigs' heads, and you can have him, okay? That's who set us up with the deal. All right? I need an address. (MEN LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Excuse me for a moment, Councilman. Hey, Manning. GPS on the number puts this Debo there an hour ago. Fuckin' mess here. I checked with NYPD. Still nothing on Diamond or your nephew. Would it kill you to put things off until this blows over? Impossible. I have two weeks before this building deal closes. What happened to knowing when to walk? I ain't walking. You don't know the strings I had to pull for this. I saw the strings on the way in. Ah. (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) You all right, man? What is that? It's a Ho Ho, guy. You've never had a Ho Ho? No, the bottle. This? I got water in the fuel line. Feel good? You got the Saturday night special. It's a good gun, man, but you're not gonna get very far with six shots, brother. Here, I got you this. Take it. Good to go. Thanks. You ready? Let's roll, buddy. Highway to the danger zone. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Who you with? My boy, hoping to come see Debo about buying some shit.

We did not set you up. No? (GASPS, EXCLAIMS) How about now? Okay, sir. Tell him the truth! Tell him! I had no choice. Have no choice, man. Dirty swine comes here every month. Every month, they come here to take their money. They always bring a product to buy, but this time, I don't even... They wanted buyers, first-timers they could turn really quick. They set us all up. They set us up! They say when they leave, that's it, I'm not gonna see them anymore. They set us all up. All right, you're gonna call 'em. That's no... (YELLS) Shut the fuck up! You fucking fuck!

How do I fucking know? (LAUGHS) Feed him to the fucking dogs. Listen, listen to me. Just listen. Slow down, slow down, slow down. Right now, nobody knows that the evidence is missing. And the department ain't gonna give a fuck about a few dead drug dealers. Your uncle may take it to heart if we kill you. Son... The clock is ticking. And when it strikes, you're the liability. So be smart. The ball's in your court, champ. The De Soto. (PHONE VIBRATING) Room 1307. (SPITS) Hello? MAN: (ON PHONE) Hello. I'm looking to buy some of that product that you have. I have cash.

We might need him to get to his uncle. HINES: All right. (SOBS) Thank you. Hello! Housekeeping! Nice. Look at what we got. There's no fucking cash. There's no cash. MOE: All they want is the money, all right? You let them rip you off, you're done. It'll be okay. (SIGHS) Do you have the product? (INHALES SHARPLY) Where's my shit? (CAR APPROACHING) What's up, man? Why'd your boss change his mind? Because he knows a great deal when he sees one. Yeah, I bet. Where the fuck's the cash? Oh, fuck. (DUFFY CHUCKLES) Wow. Fuckin' guy brought the cash to the deal. Un-fucking-believable. (ENGINE STARTING) Fuck... Fuck. (ENGINE STARTING) DUFFY: We got your product. That's beautiful. Now we can't get it in till after the shift change. DUFFY: That's fine.

What about the cash? Man, fuck O'Donnel. We split it three ways. MARTINEZ: Fucking good with me, man. Ah, man, let's fuckin' do it. Go and clean it up. All right. You head back and wait for us at the station. HINES: All right, man. (BREATHING HEAVILY) Please tell me it was there. Yeah, yeah, it was half there. That's all right.

(GRUNTING) (SKUNK WHIMPERS) (MARTINEZ GROANING) (MACHETE CLANGS) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (COUGHS) SKUNK: It's over, it's over. They killed Lola. - Oh... - Fuck. Moe, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Listen, we can leave now. Let's just go. You know, we could go anywhere. I'm finishing with your uncle first. The fuckers. SKUNK: (ON RECORDING) It is what it is. You think I'm holding out, you take the deal down yourself. FEDEX: (ON RECORDING) Come on, man. You know I don't have the money to do this on my own. (TAPE RECORDER REWINDING) (TAPE RECORDER BEEPS) All right, man. Fuck. So what am I supposed to tell Debo when he calls, "I'm not coming"? Or what? SKUNK: No... We'll talk our way through it. Listen, regardless of what happens, we meet tonight at the club at 2:00. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (DOOR CLOSES) (CELLPHONE VIBRATING) Hello? Hey, your nephew's fucked. PERICO: Fucked how? I'm sending you a recording. Listen and delete it immediately. You got an hour tops to clean up. You understand? Give me a clean cell phone number. 212-555-0168. Yo, what the fuck happened to you, man? SKUNK: I'm all right. It's okay. Dude, what the... Here, I've got you, man. Look at this fuckin' guy, man. Dude, look at your fuckin' face. SKUNK: Yeah, I fuckin' know. (DOOR CLOSES) (BAG THUDS HEAVILY) Crazy motherfucker! I didn't mean this literally. I have to give it to you, a man of his worth is hard to come by these days. If only this wasn't all a twisted fucking fairy tale. It's done now, so we're leaving. (GRUNTS, GROANS) What are you doing? He brought back your money! We're leaving just like you said! Yeah. Let me talk to Bobby alone. Bobby! SKUNK: He fixed it! Bobby! It's over! Bobby! (RECORDING PLAYING ON PHONE) SKUNK: He just canceled the rest of the pickups. MOE: Why? SKUNK: I don't know. He just wants us to hold the money and stay the fuck away from the garage until tomorrow. I mean, what if it's all lost, man? This was our chance to start something on our own. All right, all right. Calm down. This has to happen! MOE: All he did was delay things until tomorrow, right? SKUNK: I knew he would do this. He doesn't trust you. MOE: Why wouldn't he trust me? Whoa... Whoa... Hey, he doesn't trust me, so he can't trust you either. What? What... What is that? Jersey City Police recovered voice recorder. Jersey City? The hospital you dropped him in. Bobby, the man sitting in that room is an undercover cop. A cop you introduced all over this city as your friend. A cop you've set a dozen laundering deals with. A cop who will lead to hundreds of arrests! His real name is Killerman... Frank Killerman. But... No, no! He hacked their heads off! I mean, how could a cop do that? He doesn't know he's a cop! He did it because they killed his baby and almost killed his girl. Lola's not dead? No, she's not dead. They shot her, but she's not dead. His rat of a baby is. Was it all a lie? Everything that he said? (PERICO SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) (IN ENGLISH) Your feelings are hurt? Are you kidding me? He'll put you in jail for the rest of your life! Just pray that girlfriend didn't know his real name! What kind of animal lives like that? You have to be snake, dirty, backstabbing snake! SKUNK: (SHAKILY) What are you... What are you... Bobby... Bobby, you're like a son to me. I would never lead you astray. But you brought him in. You opened us up to this... And you will finish it. He came for me. They woulda killed me if he didn't come. I understand. Empty it in his head. I'm the one. I want to be the one to tell him. Good. Good. Bring him in. (DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) You fucked me, man! You really fucked me on this! Skunk, what the fuck are you doing, man? Tell him. Tell him! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! You dirty fuck! (SCREAMS) Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! What the fuck just happened, man? Skunk, what the fuck, man? He wanted me to kill you. You killed the cops. You weren't with them. What was he talking about when he... Tell me what? That I choose him over you. He wasn't gonna let either one of us walk out of here alive. It's over. Just you and me now. Come on, we gotta go. (CAR ALARM CHIRPS) (CAR ENGINE STARTS)
