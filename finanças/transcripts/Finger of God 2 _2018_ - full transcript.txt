[MUSIC PLAYING] I'm giving myself for the one thing-- the one thing-- that's worth giving myself for in all of history in all world, one thing worth dying for. I'm here doing it right now. It just kept coming back again and again. There's nothing else worth it like this. There's no nation. There's no government. There's nothing-- nothing worth it the way this is worth it. This is the one thing for all of history all of time that worth giving everything for. To see that God is here on the move, actively in hot pursuit of a humanity that's even in denial of Him. This is, at this time, the most dangerous country in the world for Christians-- days before a bomb killing 90 people, injuring 200 people, shutting down the city streets, shutting down a major part of the city. The tension that that brought, that whole tension of death was moving into this place of Christians accusing other Christians if you keep going out and evangelizing, if you keep sharing your faith, if you keep inviting people to Jesus, you're going to get us killed. And then they got it. Oh, Holy Spirit, just go before us. Direct us. Father, we just thank you that Jesus is going to be so famous I had saw a guy walking down the street, and it was limping. And I knew he had a leg shorter than the other. DRIVER: [NON-ENGLISH] Can you come here? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] (VOICEOVER) At the height of the most dangerous time of the year...the tension was so strong. This one is shorter, yeah. Oh, man, look at that. That is significant. OK. In Jesus' name, I command his hips to line up. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Grow right now in Jesus' name. I declare peace in these hips in Jesus' name. And so I'm holding the guy's legs, and we're praying and commanding this leg to grow in Jesus' name. All of a sudden, we see the police approaching in the distance. [LAUGHING] Perfect alignment. Perfect alignment right now. WOMAN: Police is here. ROBBY DAWKINS: OK. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS (VOICEOVER): I sat there and I thought, man, there's no place to run. If this turns quick, we're completely uncovered. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] WOMAN: He's asking why you're filming. He wants to see it. ROBBY DAWKINS (VOICEOVER): When I saw them standing there and they grabbed the camera and they grabbed the phone, I was like, oh, no. All the evidence is on there. They have it all. They have-- all they have to do is look past a couple little scenes, and that's it. We're dead. WOMAN: [INAUDIBLE] Lord make blind-- seeing eyes blind. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Of them? No, no, no. WOMAN: [INAUDIBLE]. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS: Make seeing eyes blind. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] (VOICEOVER) It was the hardest thing getting in that car and taking off. But yet the Lord spoke to me. As soon as we started to pull away, He said, the seed is planted. You clearly demonstrated the gospel. The seed was planted. It's not done. There's more to come. If we react in fear and just hide, that's what he wants. But we react to that and by going out and healing the sick, telling them about Jesus. (VOICEOVER) Here we are in the moment. Everything was lining up. Everything made sense. This opposition actually is there to create a fire, to stir us to increase everything rather than pull back from everything. And so it was at that point, our last day together, we prayed, Holy Spirit, would you come? Would you fall on us with boldness? Would You send your fire here? And He came-- [LAUGHS] came with fire. And He came with boldness. And He came with the release. And He came with courage. They needed a power surge of the Holy Spirit. They needed to be impacted. They needed to be shook. They needed to be filled and empowered. And it only came by that power of the Holy Spirit, by the Holy Spirit coming and filling them with something that had to be beyond themselves, with the power and authority, a release, a boldness. A holy boldness was the only way that it could happen. [LAUGHTER] Hoo. (VOICEOVER) They were like, where/s more? We got to do more. We got to see more. Now all the gloves are off. Now everything's changed. Now we're going all in. During Ramadan, most of the Muslim people, they only come out at night because during the day they have to fast. There's no-- they can't even drink water. And so we're winding around through the streets-- desolate area. It's just sort of extreme place, out of the way. Did you guys see that guy walking back there on that side of that road? Is it possible? DRIVER: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS: Oh, he's missing an arm! Wow! DRIVER: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] WOMAN: He's asking what type [INAUDIBLE].. He said [INAUDIBLE] explosion [INAUDIBLE].. Do you want that we pray for you? ROBBY DAWKINS: What's wrong with his hands? WOMAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] WOMAN: She asked [INAUDIBLE]. DRIVER: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. WOMAN: His hands, also, he has some problem. ROBBY DAWKINS: He can't stretch them out? WOMAN: He cannot open [INAUDIBLE].. ROBBY DAWKINS: So touch his hand, huh? All right, Father, in the name of Jesus-- [DRIVER AND WOMAN INTERPRET] I command this hand-- [DRIVER AND WOMAN INTERPRET] --to be healed right now. [DRIVER AND WOMAN INTERPRET] I command-- [DRIVER AND WOMAN INTERPRET] --these fingers-- [DRIVER AND WOMAN INTERPRET] --to straighten right now. [DRIVER AND WOMAN INTERPRET] Be healed in Jesus' name. [DRIVER AND WOMAN INTERPRET] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] DRIVER: Oh, he's surprised. ROBBY DAWKINS: He's surprised at this? DRIVER: Yeah, now he's surprised now. ROBBY DAWKINS: You see Jesus loves you so much? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS: His finger is more straight. WOMAN: And the pain is lifting, he said. ROBBY DAWKINS: And his finger is straight. His finger was bent. WOMAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] He said it that he had a lot of pain in his finger before. ROBBY DAWKINS: You see it? DRIVER: Yeah. ROBBY DAWKINS: [LAUGHS] I saw his fingers straighten up. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS: Wow, look at that, man. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS: His finger's not bent. WOMAN: [INAUDIBLE]. ROBBY DAWKINS: No, I know. I saw his hand was like that before. Yeah. Jesus just healed your hand. It was like that. Now it's like all straight. Straighten it out all the way. Look at that, man. Yeah, there's no more pain. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS: I saw it. I know. I saw his finger was like that, and these fingers were like that. WOMAN: Yeah. ROBBY DAWKINS: Yeah. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] WOMAN: He feels such peace in his heart. ROBBY DAWKINS: Yeah. You know, that's Jesus telling you how much He loves you. WOMAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. ROBBY DAWKINS (VOICEOVER): It was the moment, the pinnacle, of what we knew God had sent us there for what to do and to see that and to catch that. He's really for us. He's contending for us. He's breaking through. He's doing it. This isn't us having to do it. This is us having to be just wise as serpents alone. He's there. He's got a sword drawn. He's fighting in this battle. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] WOMAN: He's feeling very good feeling now. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] WOMAN: Uh-huh, he said that he will be able to sacrifice himself for Jesus. MAN: Lead him to Christ. WOMAN: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] ROBBY DAWKINS: Let's pray with him right there, yeah. (VOICEOVER) You have to say the name of Jesus. There's power in that name. That will change things. That will disarm things. You have to say the name of Jesus. And so he says the name of Jesus, translates it. And then there is this peace. WOMAN: He said he's feeling so much peace that he never felt before since he was born. ROBBY DAWKINS: Hallejiah. Praise God. So good. (VOICEOVER) A day later, talking about as soon as you translated the name of Jesus, there was something that happened. You're my brother. I love you, my brother. I love you. I love you. I love you. I'm going to pray for you all the time. I love you. They just got in impartation of boldness. They got it. And it just-- I lost it after that because I was like, Lord, they can't see me go there and do this. They've got to see you're fighting for them. You're fighting for them. You're defending them because they're the ones doing this every day on the line. I'm just coming in. I'm just providing the spark. This is their opportunity to see God is on our side. And He is advancing this gospel. It's not just us and our efforts and us in our persuasion abilities or ability to speak. But it is a collision. It is the kingdom breaking into the natural and demonstrating the reality of the power of Jesus and Him showing I am Lord. And this is my nation. And I will be proclaimed in the streets of this city. [MUSIC PLAYING] WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): I am Will Hacker, and this is my movie. This is Darren Wilson, who you may recognize is the guy who made Finger of God and has been filming God around the world ever since. And it's because of my friendship with him that I'm being thrown into this adventure. Ready. INTERVIEWER: All right, you ready? Are they ready? Are you ready? When I started my journey, what, 10, 12 years ago, it was from a place of deep skepticism, with, like, that God's doing stuff. But for you, it was more, well, what's the point, right? Like what's the point of all? I've been a pastor my whole life. And I feel like is the point just salvation? Is the point miracles? Is the point, like-- if God's doing all this stuff, why, right? And what I saw in you was somebody who-- you were so desperate. You're desperate for Him. And it's like that's all you need. That's the great breakthrough. I think adventures in life come from a place of great desperation, like, God, I need to see You. If you're really going after the Father's heart, I mean, what are you going to find? You're going to find the most loving person in the universe. You're chasing after the heart of God. How can that not be worth it? Even if you find a tiny bit of Him, it's worth it. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): Now, you have to understand something about me and my past. Where Darren started his journey as a skeptic, wasn't sure what he believed, I had been a pastor for 15 years and was quite sure of what I believed. Now, I had heard about Bethel Church in Redding, California, where God was doing incredible things and has become a lightning rod for the miraculous around the world. I'd also heard many of my more conservative friends wondering if it was actually legit. So I was probably as curious as I was excited to come out here and see for myself what all the fuss was about. Needless to say, I did not leave disappointed. Broken people in Isaiah 61, the first four three verses are about the captives being set free, the prisoners being released, the broken heart being restored. Then it ends with this, verse 4, "and then they shall return." Who's the "they?" All the broken people who got a miracle. The light shines so that we can be a city on a hill that can't be hidden. Jesus didn't say you're the light of the church. He said you're the light of the world. So could the light get brighter and the world get darker because the light is positioned in the world? The power of God has to leave the four walls of the church. Yes, people should come in and get healed. But they're healed to a purpose of transformation. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): I've heard people talk about God all my life. But here they don't just wrestle with big theological issues, they also try to demonstrate what they believe in real, tangible ways. So this led me to head out with Chris Overstreet on a typical student kingdom adventure with Jonathan and Johnny from Germany. Chris and I had planned to go out to Chico University to give students an encounter with God. Now, I have heard God speaking to me for over 20 years. But I was quickly learning that filming it was as much about listening as it was stepping out in faith and believing. After an hour of driving, I had a sense that we were supposed to turn the car around and head back to Redding. But I didn't know why. Do I stick with the plan, or do I listen to what I think God is saying? So with much hesitancy, we got off the highway at 11 o'clock at night and turned back around. As we pulled into the drive-through in Redding, God finally decided to whisper His plan to us. You know what, Chris? I think we're going to meet a guy? He's just been waiting. I guess I'm saying he'd been crying out for God. And I feel God's going to put us in his path tonight. I feel that's one soul why God would want us to be in downtown. I said clearly that impression's always right. The Holy Spirit wants to touch him. WILL HACKER: What's his name? Paul. First thing that came to my mind, it's like Michael. WILL HACKER: You know what? I got the name Mike, too. Mike? WILL HACKER: Yeah. Wow. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): So that's all we had, the name Mike at midnight, when the whole city is essentially asleep. But if it really was God giving us this name, it meant God had a plan, and it was our job to simply trust Him. So we started driving around Redding looking for a guy named Mike. Hey, buddy, is your name Mike, Michael? PASSENGER: Do you know Michael? Do you know anybody named Michael? Are you Michael? No? You don't know? All right, awesome, man. Jesus loves you. A lot of times people think that when you're stepping out you're always right on with the right person. And it's so good and it's so liberating to realize sometimes you don't always get it right. But you never quit. You keep going. You keep loving people, and you keep being faithful with God's place in your heart. We drive a little bit further. We go downtown. And we go to Taco Bell. We see this guy, and we ask him. I said, hey, is your name Mike? And he says no. And then we walk across the street. We see a group of guys outside. And we walk across the street. And Jonathan shares. He says, hey, is there someone here named Michael? And man, the whole scene changed. Is anybody named Michael here? Michael just left. Michael M? JONATHAN CHANDRA: This is good. Listen, this is going to sound crazy because-- We were in the car and he actually had a word that Michael M, Michael was here. Hold on. Let me go grab him. [INAUDIBLE] So we came, and we knew God was saying I'm going to talk to Michael today. So I don't know anything. We don't know anything about him, right? But we came. We talked about this in the car. There's something-- somebody named Michael God wants to touch. I'm just warning you guys. You guys asked for Michael Murphy. You're about to get Michael Murphy. [LAUGHTER] Be careful what you wish for, all right? [LAUGHS] Hey, Murph. JONATHAN CHANDRA: Hey, Michael. I'm Michael M. [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah, I think-- I think I remember. Where'd you just, like, pick this up? Yeah, well, we were driving, and we were at McDonald's, and we were talking at McDonald's. And we said-- and Jonathan said, I felt that we're going to see a Michael. And I said, yeah, a Mike, I feel a Mike, too. And then Jonathan said something about you. I feel like he went through a loss or something. Tell him, Jonathan, what you-- I had this impression that there's something you lost, a beloved ones that you lost. Yeah, just like a few weeks ago. Wow. Not lost, not passed away, but yeah. Is it your dad? MICHAEL: Yeah. OK. And man, this is going to sound-- Starting to get really weird here. Yeah, I know, right? Because we were about-- we were about to go somewhere else. And I felt like maybe we should to go downtown. And the word-- we clearly heard the word Michael. And I saw a picture of somebody like you know being lost, family being lost. Do you have pain on your hip, right here? Do you have any pain, or does it hurt? Oh, my god! Didn't say-- didn't say a word! How'd you know that? How'd you know that? I just got a shot yesterday. I got ran over on my Harley. I've been walking with a cane for-- since I got here, since I got off all-- the narcotics that the doctors gave me. That's [BLEEP] weird, man. Yeah. And you pointed right to my hip, too. That's crazy, yeah. I'm feeling a bit-- the reason I'm asking, I'm feeling the pain. Yeah, I got ran over on my Harley, broke my back, tore my ear off, shoved my leg through my [BLEEP],, literally, split my femur. My whole hip shattered. I was in ICU for a long time. JONATHAN CHANDRA: Michael, here's the question, would you give God a chance to heal your body and, you know-- Absolutely. JONATHAN CHANDRA: Yeah. Can we do that? Yeah. We're going to pray for you, all right? I believe God's going to touch you, man. This is not coincidental. The power of God-- it's all about the love of Jesus, man. Absolutely. JONATHAN CHANDRA: Let's pray for your hip first. And anywhere else? You need prayer like right here? No, just my hip. I'm cool. OK, cool. Don't get freaked out. [INAUDIBLE] God is just getting things done in your life, in your [INAUDIBLE]. Let me pray for you. Thank you, God. God, you showed us Michael. More than us, God, you are interested in Michael's life. Lord, I just release your healing power right now. Holy Spirit, touch Michael right now. I command every pain, every trauma that this body went through because of the shot and all those things that happened, God, release healing right now. Jesus, you said you will [INAUDIBLE] anybody. But whoever comes to you will receive life. I pray for life over him right now in Jesus' mighty name. Right now, Lord, I pray for this hip to be healed right now-- right now. Hip, I speak to you, come alive, in Jesus' name right now. Father, fill him with your love. Can I pray, just put my hand-- Lord, fill him with your presence, God. Michael, Jesus is a good father. You feel like you've lost your father. But God is saying, you know what, Michael? We have never left you. He's your father. Even if your father and mother forsake you, the Lord will take care of you. He's so proud of you, man. He's so proud of you. It's so insane that He would send us at this hour to come and pray for you. We were supposed to go to Chico, but God said, no, I want to talk to Michael. So we just release healing, Lord. Right now, Father, fill him with your presence. Can you-- do you feel something? What are you feeling? Warm. Yeah. That's the love of God. That's the power of God, man. Lord, fill him, Lord. Where do you feel the warm? In my heart. Your heart? Thank you, Lord. Let us just pray all over his body, God. Fill him up, every sign of the enemy. See, the devil come to steal, to kill, and destroy our life. Right now, right now in Jesus' name, up. Can you check it out, how you feel? Your hip, does it-- That's really weird. This is, like, really tripping me out. JONATHAN CHANDRA: So do you think the pain is gone-- gone down? Yeah. Oh, yeah, it's gone down a lot. JONATHAN CHANDRA: Wow. Is there still any pain left? Yeah. Just like [INAUDIBLE],, residue-type pain, which will get better, and I'll get stronger. I'll give you a hug, man. Thank you. Thank the Father. Can you guys just hold your hands out like this? Can you guys all hold your hands out? How is your stomach feeling right now after prayer? It's better. OK, so it's went down. OK. We're just going to invite the Holy Spirit to touch you guys right now. I'm asking, Holy Spirit, will you come in might, come in power, reveal yourself to them right now. We pray for your presence. Lord, touch them, touch them, touch them, touch them. Thank you, that you're softening them. Let your presence be felt upon them, Lord, right now, in Jesus' name. Lord, we thank you, God, for power. Thank you, God, for your power. Let your power rest upon them-- power, power, power. Power of God rest upon them. Rest upon them, Lord Jesus. Thank you, God, for what you're doing. 100% healing, Lord Jesus. The Holy Spirit is a person. And the Holy Spirit loves to reveal Jesus to us. He's real. He's alive. He's here. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): It was only afterward we found out this place was a drug rehabilitation center. Everyone here had 40 days to get sober and turn their lives around or they would be sent to jail. We often look at people like this as broken. But really, they're no more broken than the rest of us. Their junk just looks different than our junk. But it was here for these people that God chose to come down and show He's actually the king of the broken. Do you have a daughter? [INAUDIBLE] Is she with you or-- WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): But of course, we are all at war with a very real enemy. Light battles darkness. And darkness doesn't always go quietly. We saw this clearly when our attention turned to the guy who had been standing in the corner all night. Just out of respect for the three of you, like, I've taken-- it probably wouldn't be a good a idea to touch me. Because, like, over the past several years I've taken a different route and done things to myself. [INAUDIBLE] pretty much of a negative, darker fashion. But, like, when you mentioned-- earlier, when you had us a do a little prayer thing, like with the Holy Spirit, you asked how we felt. I felt, yes, I could feel it. I could feel the weight upon my hands. But while everyone else was feeling better, I was actually feeling like a lance was being stabbed through me, like continuous pain. Like it was actually hurting me. It's a demon. You want it out? If you can call it by its name, I'm sure it will. Listen, God's going to deliver you right now. So I'm going to pray for you, bro. I just hope it doesn't backlash on you guys [INAUDIBLE]. No, it's not going to backlash on me, man. It's not going to backlash on me at all. He loves you, OK? Let me ask you a question. Do you want freedom? Yes. Are you sure? Yes, I'm sure. Do you want to break the chains? Yes, any chains that restrict me. OK. All right, then take this off. Take this off. Any other things you want to get taken off? OK. Holy Spirit, come. In Jesus' mighty name. Take authority over your body, your soul, and spirit. Right now, Holy Spirit touch him in Jesus' light and name. And I just cut the lines to the spiritual world. Everything that's not from God, I command it to come out right now in the name of Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. JONATHAN CHANDRA: Out, in Jesus' light and name. JOHN: Jesus, Jesus. JONATHAN CHANDRA: No more. This man belongs to Jesus. There was a moment where we felt prophetic was flowing, word of knowledge was flowing. There was such a peace. And then when we prayed for him, this kind of like irritating, unpleasant, and disturbed atmosphere shifted. I felt intensity. I felt the fear in the room. I felt the pressure of the enemy over his life. But I felt the peace of Jesus. I felt the peace of the Holy Spirit. The only thing that I was little worry about is I thought he was going to punch me because he was like, stop, stop, stop this. And Chris was just like, keep going. Chris was like-- I was like, well, I guess take a punch for the Gospel. CHRIS OVERSTREET: Say, the power of God lives inside of me. The power of God lives inside of me. CHRIS OVERSTREET: Say, devil-- Devil-- CHRIS OVERSTREET: --I'm destroying your works. --I'm destroying your works. CHRIS OVERSTREET: I'm breaking the contract that we had. I'm breaking the contract that we had. By power of the blood of Jesus-- By the power of the blood of Jesus-- --has made me clean. --has made me clean. In Jesus' name. In Jesus' name. I'm going to pray for you now. Lord, thank you-- Ouch. --for for this man. In the name of Jesus Christ, loose him. In the name of Jesus Christ-- in the name of Jesus-- look at me. Look at me. I'm looking at you right now. And I'm telling you, the more guys are touching me, the worse it's getting. It's hurting the [BLEEP] out of my chest. Almost all the stuff that went away is coming back. I'll tell you right now. CHRIS OVERSTREET: Lord, just say this, Jesus-- Jesus-- --you live in me. --you live in me. And you're more powerful. You're more powerful. Fill me with your peace. Fill me with your peace. CHRIS OVERSTREET: And that lying spirit-- And that lying spirit-- guys, get your hands off me, please. CHRIS OVERSTREET: --leave me. Get your hands off me, please. Just say that, your lying spirit, leave me. Your lying spirit, leave me. And I'm looking at you. But I'm saying the more you guys are doing that, the more my chest is starting to constrict. And everything that you guys made go away originally is coming back full force. Yeah. Yeah. God, we just pray for protection for this man. And it has to do with wording that I've made when I did it. It has nothing to do with I'm joining with you. It was pretty much I don't-- You made a covenant. I don't even want to say what I said on camera. Yeah, well, just looking at him right now and say, devil-- Devil-- CHRIS OVERSTREET: I want you say it with guts. Say, devil-- Devil-- CHRIS OVERSTREET: You're a liar. You're a liar. CHRIS OVERSTREET: And I'm not serving you. And I'm not serving you. CHRIS OVERSTREET: The blood of Jesus-- The blood of Jesus-- CHRIS OVERSTREET: --breaks the contract. --breaks the contract. CHRIS OVERSTREET: I'm breaking up with you. I'm breaking up with you. CHRIS OVERSTREET: And I'm serving Jesus Christ. And I'm serving Jesus Christ. We can't be intimidated by darkness. Jesus was born in the manger not in the palace. Many people are interested in palace Christianity. But that's not what Jesus is interested in. Jesus is interested in destroying the works of the devil, going to dark places, and shining bright. And if we believe that Jesus is a little light, then we will shine very little. But if we believe that he is the light of the world, we will look for opportunities to shine bright. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): When you step out in faith, God moves. These people were not allowed to leave the center. And the only way they were going to encounter God was for Him to bring us to them. Thankfully, we had ears to hear Him that night. And as He whispered the name Mike to us, we walked in simple, blind obedience, freaking out a bit, but still moving forward because God knows what He's doing. A father found his kids. Then he poured out his love and acceptance upon them. And Johnny, a 23-year-old student from Germany, led them in their first conversation with a father who pursued them by bringing perfect strangers to their doorstep at midnight. Now say, thank you, Jesus-- Thank you, Jesus-- JOHNNY: --that you are real. --that you are real. JOHNNY: That you love me. That you love me. JOHNNY: That you care for me. That you care for me. JOHNNY: And that he you died for me. CROWD: And that you died for me. JOHNNY: Today, I surrender my life to you. I surrender my life to you. JOHNNY: I believe that you that died for me. CROWD: I believe that you died for me. JOHNNY: And that you rose for me. CROWD: --that you rose for me. JOHNNY: That I can have eternal life. CROWD: That I can have eternal life. What starts today-- What starts today-- In Jesus' name. CROWD: --in Jesus' name. Fill me with the Holy Spirit-- Fill me with the Holy Spirit-- JONATHAN CHANDRA: --with your love-- CROWD: --with your love-- JONATHAN CHANDRA: --and your joy. CROWD: --and with your joy. JONATHAN CHANDRA: In Jesus' name, I pray. CROWD: In Jesus' name, I pray. Worship is everything. We worship the King because He has won the victory. That night was a victorious night. Jesus did it. He was so victorious. We had to give Jesus glory. We had to worship Him. And the whole atmosphere shifted. It was-- man, we went from this hell to heaven. We went from this valley right up, mountaintop experience. It felt like Jesus is here. Anything can happen. Everybody likes to call God a refuge, but nobody likes the battle. Everybody likes the shield of God, but nobody likes when arrows are flying at their faces. But you don't learn Him as a shield until you stare down the arrows and wait for Him, maybe at the last minute, to come up and protect you. For me, like, that is why David was a man after God's own heart because he could say, he could be real enough to say, like, this is how it feels. God is not looking for visitation. He's looking for habitation. Jesus went to prepare dwelling places for God and bring us back to that whole original plan of just abiding in His presence. And you learn that I can stare down the arrows, and He will be my shield. I can trust Him in those moments. And He's not going to leave me alone. And I can feel the pain, but He is still good. And we're going to trust in His goodness. If I don't interpret the scriptures through the lens of love, they'll never make sense to me. And this is the basis of healings and miracles. It's not about faith. Jesus said if you have faith of a mustard seed you can see a mountain move. We don't have faith problems. We have love problems. He prays in John 17:3 to the father for us that we would have deep friendship with Him. This is eternal life that they may know you. Jeremiah 9, John 17:3, He turns to his disciples in the upper room and says, all right, guys, I no longer call you servants. I call you friends. Jeremiah 9:23 and 24, "if any man boast, boast about this, that he knows me and he's close with me." I have never seen the Father disappoint anyone on this earth when your expectation is deep friendship with the Him-- ever. It says Jesus when He's baptized in water, the spirit of God rested upon Him in the form of a dove and remained. So there was this-- not just the presence within. There was the presence upon. He's in me for my sake, but He comes upon me for yours. And so I want both. I want that comfort and the peace that He gives me, the direction. But I also want that empowerment that makes me an instrument in His hands to alter the environment of any place I go. It's not a heaven or hell issue. It's just how much of His world will I see in this one. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): What do you do when the Holy Spirit burns across the country like wildfire and millions of people capture passion for Jesus where it's illegal to gather or even teach the word of God? For that matter, how do you equip church leaders in a country that forbids bibles from crossing its borders and imprisons those who are filled with the Holy Spirit? These are the questions that my friend Putty Putman has been trying to answer for thousands of leaders in the underground church in China through his school of Kingdom Ministry. I had heard the incredible things God was doing through the Holy Spirit in the underground church. But I longed to see it with my own eyes. I had just watched God move where He was free to do so. But what about where He wasn't? I think on one hand and China, you have a church that's absolutely exploding. It's hard to actually capture how much God is doing in China. I mean, here you have a movement that was as close to being extinguished as possible by the Cultural Revolution. And it's now exploding into one of the most dynamic churches in the world today. It's just incredible. I mean, there's more believers there than in America. And at the same time, because of that persecution, people don't become Christians lightheartedly. People don't check out Christianity there. If you commit, you're committing to a potential jail sentence. And so if you're in the church, you're all in. You're 100% in. When you get a church of all bought in, all 100% in people, it's dynamic. God can do incredible things there. What used to be tens, hundreds of thousands is now tens, hundreds of millions. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): I grew up and even pastored in churches where I simply had to decide if it was worth it to wake up and go to Sunday morning service. Here, Christians had to decide if it was worth it to go to church and risk losing their job, going to jail, or even be beaten as a result of their faith. The reality of being discovered was so intense, in fact, that we, like all who belong to this church, had to take 12 flights of stairs so that no one would see us. [PANTING] What floor are we? (VOICEOVER) I had heard so much about the famous underground church in China, and here it was, hiding from the government, but open and vulnerable with God-- no band, no projector screen, no dynamic personality speaking to them. They simply gathered to worship, to celebrate, and to join together to honor the true King, Jesus Christ. And what better way to honor Him than to quietly take communion together, just as Jesus did with His disciples 2,000 years ago. They hide their bodies from the government, but they open their hearts to God and each other. But then it got even more intense. One of the biggest secrets among the underground church are the missionary seminaries. These are unlike anything you've heard of before, and they're one of the most closely guarded secrets of the church in China. I was humbled beyond measure to be the first Westerner ever allowed to film inside one of these seminaries. But to do so, we were going to have to be smuggled in. Pastor said actually, his place has been spotted by the government so they come to check on him periodically. He said the government official already has been suspicious about what he's doing. So they check on him periodically. WILL HACKER: Are we putting him in danger? WOMAN: In this place, they haven't been-- like, there's never been foreigners like us coming to this place-- never. You are the first ones. Maybe last ones, too. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): So why are these such a big deal? A select few are chosen for these seminaries. They're sent to a top secret building which they never leave for two years, as they are trained and built up in God's spirit and truth. When their training is done, many will buy a one-way ticket to the Middle East, knowing they will never come home again and will most likely be tortured and die at the hands of Muslim extremists. It is the greatest sacrifice they can offer. But to them it's worth it to be able to take Jesus to the heart of the lion's den. Where very few are willing to carry Him. WOMAN: Stay away from windows. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): Who was I to be invited to this? None of these people will write a book or have a podcast or be on TV shows. None of them will fill stadiums or become household names. Even now for a movie, they must remain hidden and humble. Yet I was struck by the realization of Jesus' words when He told us that in His kingdom, the first shall be last, and the last shall be first. And I realized I was walking among some of the greatest heroes of our faith, and no one will ever know their names. [SINGING HYMNS IN CHINESE] The new covenant isn't it Jesus died so I could get to heaven alone. That's just a part of it. Jesus died so that the power of heaven could be made known in His people, His "ekklesia," the church. The strong man has now been bound. You have authority to plunder his house. So it's the plundering of the enemy's house. It's the pushing back of darkness. It's the taking away the kingdom that was lost. The whole point is not just get saved and be good and be moral so you can go to heaven. God no longer is just putting His spirit upon the priest and the kings and the prophets. God is now pouring out His spirit upon all of His people. And His ultimate desire is pour out His spirit upon all flesh, that the knowledge of the glory of the Lord will cover the Earth as the waters to the sea. He delights in my trust. And so I think that it's faith is one thing. But I think relationally trust almost goes beyond faith because I can stand in what I know, and I can decide not to waver. But my heart rests in the relational trust that I have in God and-- I like you said recently your heart is so trusting that you're joyful. And that's huge. I mean, when we're so trusting that it brings us joy because we have complete trust-- And hope, yeah. What our responsibility is, is to love God with all of our heart. Do not put out the Spirit's fire. It's not Satan putting out the Spirit's fire. Let me-- just because I got the Baptist in me coming out, [LAUGHING] first Thessalonians 5:19, "do not put out the Spirit's fire." That's it. That's the whole verse. Don't do it. 2 Timothy, chapter 1, "fan into flame the gift of God that's in you for the laying on of my hands. For God didn't give you a spirit of timidity but of power, of love, and of a sound mind, or self-discipline." Self discipline keeps you fanning it, moving it, keeps going after it, whether you feel it or not. You have the ability to earnestly seek and desire the spiritual gifts. You have to do it. And that's what Paul says. You have to do it. It's in your hands to steward this thing. And if that's a revival, steward it, right? That's gift's, steward it. If that's your children and being a mom, steward it. Fan that thing. The invitation's there for the entire body. It's just will there be people that will stand up and take the risk and go for it. We sometimes judge things from a Wall Street mentality. We run them through our filters, which aren't always kingdom filters. There are church filters, religious filters, humanistic filters, political filters. God's filter is kingdom. It's a family. "Our Father, for Thine is the kingdom." All kingdom issues are family issues. Once we leave the concept of family, we've left the subject to the kingdom. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): I'd seen people risking their lives for the Gospel, seen them trust a whisper, and even choose to set their own life aside for something eternally greater. Well, what about facing the demons of your own past? What does it look like to see the finger of God not just inspire you to come out of sin, but be so radically transformed that you head back into your past to bring freedom to others? To find out, I headed to Northern Ireland to meet up with Scott McNamara, a former drug addict who after encountering Jesus, has led over 3,000 people to Christ, one on one, right on the streets of his hometown in Coleraine. I'd gotten to know Brian Welch, the lead guitarist for the rock band Korn. He wrestled with his own past in Darren's film, The Holy Ghost. When he was praying for people for the first time at a Korn concert, something was unlocked inside him through that. And he now regularly prays for kids at his concerts. I felt God was telling me to team him up with Scott and take Jesus to the streets in Ireland. And wouldn't you know it, Brian was able to join us between tour stops. The plan was simple, take Scott and Brian to the very same bar he used to do lines of cocaine in. Most of the people here would never go to church to meet Jesus. So we figured we'd bring Jesus to them. But as soon as we arrived, it became clear this was no ordinary day in Northern Ireland. [MARCHING BAND MUSIC PLAYING] Where should we go? Let's move over. Let's go on the other side. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): A parade had just started and would last all day, passing right by the bar that God told us to go into. But this wasn't a fun parade with cute animals and dancing troops. It was essentially a celebration of the worst that religion has to offer, otherwise known as The Troubles. This violent, bloody conflict lasted almost 40 years and pitted Protestants and Catholics in a war over nationalism. And we were caught in the middle of this parade that celebrates one religious system's dominance over the other. Not only did the streets separate the Protestant and Catholic parts of the city, but now a parade celebrating this religious divide was to be our backdrop. We wanted Jews to show up in a bar. But to do so, He was going to have to deal with the one thing that frustrated Him me more than anything else during His time here, dogmatic, loveless religion. BRIAN WELCH: Jesus! SCOTT MACNAMARA: Bless them, Lord. Bless them, Lord. Bless them, Jesus. [MARCHING BAND MUSIC PLAYING] 10 years ago, I was in this particular bar. I was snorting lines of cocaine off the bar. That's the lifestyle I was living. I was far away from God. I knew the kind of people that frequented these bars. I knew the kind of things that went on in these places. It was not the kind of place that I wanted to go now. I was all nice and clean in my nice Christian lifestyle. I didn't really want to leave that lifestyle. I felt good. I felt safe. I didn't particularly want to go back to that past where the drugs and the violence and those sort things took place. The bar owner had said to me, he said, look, Scott, the church has never tried to cross the lines of the street. The street has never welcomed the church to cross the lines. It was a situation that was unheard of in our community. You don't go to the street. It's just everybody knows it. But the Holy Spirit was asking me to go as I liked. And I wrestled for a long time because it was uncomfortable. But I always promised God that I would give Him my obedience. And the parade was just starting. So that put other things on edge a little bit. And you could, like, just cut the tension with a knife, you know that type of thing, where it's like it's really thick because of what the parade stands for and everything. So we said, Lord, what are we doing? We give this to You. Amen. [MARCHING BAND MUSIC PLAYING] BRIAN WELCH: Lets do it. Awesome. Yeah, come on in. [CHATTER] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Breakin' rocks in the hot sun, I fought the law, and the law won. I fought the law, and the law won. I fought the law, and the law won. What we want to do is just share something quickly. Can yous all hear me, eh? Yeah! OK, so this is the way it works. From what Brian we saying, everybody has a unique path. [GLASS BREAKING] [CHEERING] That's what he thought of our song. Cheers. So if you pray-- how many people here pray? Be honest. OK. How many people would pray if your family member was dying? Who would pray for your-- OK. Be honest. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. So praying is like this. Praying is like talking through a door. You know He's there somewhere. But you don't know Him personally. And all He wants you to do is know Him on a personal level. But if you don't open that door, that's not going to happen. So what we're saying today is would you take it from knowing He's there to knowing Him personally? Would you be honest with yourself, and would you admit that you're drowning? Would you admit that just because you're leaning, that if you died tonight, if you died next week, you know you wouldn't go to heaven? But what Jesus wants to offer you is this, an eternal, everlasting lifeline. And that's what Brian accepted and I accepted and many others in our own way. So what I want to ask you is this, if you don't know Jesus and you want to know Him and you want to take a hold of His hand, then I'm going to ask you just to raise your hand in the air, and we're going to pray for some of you guys. So for anybody here, God bless you. If anybody here says, yeah, I want that, I'd say, just throw your hand in the air. God bless you guys. So I want to pray that you could feel God's presence in this place. Is that OK? Can we do that? Because we believe Jesus is here right now. So I see you in the back here. If that's you, if you guys-- can you make your way to the front here because we're want to pray for you. Just come on forward. And don't-- hey. Three's got to be a time in your life when you're like, I don't care what people think. And I remember when I did this, in my heart, I was like, I need this. God, if you're real, I'm going to die. And my daughter deserves one parent that could actually have it together. So if you give me a new life, I will give my life you. If you show me you're real and get me off these drugs, I will give my life to you, I promise. But I was real with God. I was like. If you're real, give me this. And it was like-- it was like I had an understanding that this life is not all there is. Heaven is not there for when you die and you go to heaven. It's there. That's good. But heaven is here now because Christ died. He's so pure that he made it available for heaven to come and come inside of you. And you can experience it to a degree now. Look, is Jesus real, or is He not? Is the Holy Spirit real? Is the Father God-- is He real? Are they going to come into the room when we say come into the room? And in a situation like that, where it was risky-- and it felt, just to be honest, it was like this bar, a bunch of crazy people everywhere. And I was, like, really nervous. But I was like kingdom, kingdom. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): This bar had always been a no-go zone for Christians. And now people were being filled with the Holy Spirit. The chaos we started with had become peace. A bar had become church. And it became clear that these people were not looking for religion. They wanted to meet Jesus. Are you getting touched? Are you getting touched? He's real. He wants to come inside and reside and never leave. He's never going to leave you. He doesn't condemn you. He never does. That's why He came here because we're all messed up. God wants to say to you that I want to set you free from the words that were spoken over you, from the bullying, from the things that were done. I see people just calling names and even hitting you and stuff. I see you went through some stuff like that. And God wants to say, look, I want to heal a yacht because you were told some things, that you're ugly, and you were told that you're no good and you're a mistake. But God says, I love you, and I formed you. Before I formed the creation, I formed you. Before I made the creation of the heavens and the earth, I formed you, Jessica. I thought about you. I knew you. I know how many hairs are on your head. I have so many thoughts for you, more than the grains of sand on the shore. He loved you so much. He knit you together in your mother's womb. And we break off every lie of the enemy, every lie over her life, every suicidal pattern and thought, every self harm thought, every suicidal thought. Right now we declare, no more. In Jesus' name, that that is not who she is. That is not who he she That she's separate. That she is a child of God. And we declare right now in Jesus' name no more, no more voices that tell her that she's no good, no more voices that tell her that she's all a mistake. He wants you to have confidence because He's going to be your protector, OK? So you come and see us on church on Sunday. Yeah. Yeah? Bless you. [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, love you, girl. Give me a big hug. Yeah. What's your name again? George. OK, let's pray for you. Did you hear what we were saying? [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah? I saw you there. Did it bear witness with you? Did you feel something? You're totally free from accusation and perfect in Christ. He put His blood all over you. He shed His blood to make you perfect. You're a warrior. I pray for a boldness, a boldness to shatter all the fear that would come upon him when he was when he was a kid, Lord. And I ask you, Lord, that you would heal the deepest places of the wounds, of the rejection, and the bullying, and all of that stuff, Lord. Lord, I pray that you would make him a strong warrior. You have greatness in you. And God's going to use you. He's going to do something with you. I'm telling you, it didn't happen for nothing. It was not in vain. Father, we break off every bit of darkness that was spoken, put into him. So Lord, I pray right now that from this moment on, that when he looks in the mirror, he look at himself and say, do you know what? I'm a man who's loved by God. And I love myself. I like who I am. I pray against that heaviness that you'll carry no more. We declare in Jesus' name that you are loved, man. You're a man of God. And you're going to go places that you never dreamed of, man, I'm telling you. I'm telling you, man, it's going to be crazy. Much love to you, brother. Tonight love happened. And I felt amazing. BRIAN WELCH: Did you expect to meet Jesus in a bar? No, I did not expect it. Now all you got to do is live for Him, huh? Going to do that? I'll be at the next meeting. God bless you, bro. I see the Holy Spirit rest upon people. And that's what I live for is that moment where Jesus says, knock, knock, I'm outside. You got the handle. Will you let me in? It was incredible. We had a crowd of people trying to come forward. And we just tried to do the best we could to shepherd them, and we tried to pray for them. It became a holy moment. And I don't know how it works. I don't know how it happens. But something tangibly changes in the atmosphere. You see the Holy Spirit resting on people. People begin to cry. I see people in the back crying. I see people over here crying. And it was just incredible to see. But it got that busy and that sweaty that we had to go outside. So we just spilled outside because we couldn't physically-- me and Brian couldn't physically get to the people. Just, the momentum kept building, those people coming from the back, from the front. It was just-- there was people on Facebook putting it out there, taxis pulling up, more people getting out. There's people from the bars a few doors down. They were coming to the bar to listen to what we were doing when we were praying for people. And they were just attaching themselves to this sort of little mob that we had together. And it just kept increasing. And we're sitting there praying outside. And they kept wanting prayer. Some people we were praying for like a couple times. And they were still getting touched. It was like God just kept moving. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): Yet the divisive parade hadn't stopped. It was like a turf war. It was exploding between religious hate and Jesus' love. Scott was facing his past. And breakthrough was happening not simply because we were bringing grace and love, but because we believed these people worth crossing the street that divided us. We are not marked by our past but the love Jesus has for us in the present. Everyone who calls upon the name of Jesus is a son or daughter of God. Our identity is not as a Catholic or Protestant, Evangelical, or Charismatic, but simply children of a father who's knocking on the door of our hearts, waiting for us to answer. You're a big man. Make a decision, son. You pray with us. Come on, man. Dear Lord Jesus-- Dear Lord Jesus-- --today I'm giving you the heart. --today I'm giving you the heart. I'm giving all of it and I want to follow you. I want to follow you. SCOTT MACNAMARA: God loves you so much, man. It's time just to start living. Time to start living, bro. The power's in the Gospel. And we've got to remember that. You know, we can dress up church, and we can dress up the situations. But the power is in the Gospel. I believe this, that we come to our conferences and we come to church and we make deals with God. We're like, God, if you give us more power, then we'll go. But you know what? God says this. He says, you go, and I'll give you more power. He wants us to make the step. That what's the great commission? It was you go. There are people who are perishing. And what we have to do is have confidence enough to say, do you want Jesus right now? He's here. If they say yeah, they what we do is we allow the Holy Spirit. He's our evangelism partner. We say, Holy Spirit, reveal Jesus. That's what He does. I step aside, metaphorically speaking, and I let the Holy Spirit reveal Jesus. And it's in that encounter, just like in the bar last night. I don't have flowery speeches. I don't have the qualifications, the theology. But what I have is a love for my Savior. So we release this Gospel, not fancy things or anything, just saying, this is the Gospel. He loves you. He wants to rescue you. He's reaching out His hand. No one's ever been rescued without reaching up their hand. Do you want Jesus? Jesus says, this is eternal life that they may know you. I'm as clean as Jesus in the Father's eyes. Well, if I don't believe that, I'm not going to have faith and have friendship with someone that I think is out to get me. Jesus came to reveal the Father. He wants His kids back. The law says stone the woman caught in the act of adultery. He says, I don't condemn you. She turns out to be one of His most faithful disciples. Romans 2:4, " the kindness of God leads man to repentance." Why did Jesus come here? What's the whole purpose of Him coming here? He came here to bridge us back to the Father. At some point I'm going to leave my body. I'm going to be standing in front of Him. What's really going to matter when that happens? I want to have such history with Him here that when I get on the other side we'll just continue our friendship. God delights in finding the people who will come into agreement with Him, knowing the faith that it takes to see miracles or healings take place, but the faith it takes to persevere when everything seems to be going against you and wrong, faith to believe in God's call when all you have is man's rejection. I think He likes it even to we get our eyes off of Him for a moment and begin to sink that He delights in reaching down, picking us up. When we step out of the boat, metaphorically speaking, and try to follow Him, go to Him, walking on water, I think he delighted more in Peter's getting wet than the other 11 staying dry. I think the big story is that He's pursuing us. It's time that we changed the way we think. He's perfectly good. He's the ultimate father. He's better than one you could imagine. Give Him the opportunity. Let everything be and surrender, everything you do. Fire always falls upon sacrifice. It makes every aspect of life sacred. But it's just another part of the offering, the offering in my heart. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): I was on a journey to see God's glory around the world. So I went to Tamale, Ghana, expecting to see one of the largest moves of God on the planet. But the Father had one more surprise for me. And He was about to teach me a lesson I wouldn't soon forget. I met up with evangelist Daniel Kolenda, whose mentor, Reinhard Bonnke has led more than 75 million people to Christ over the last 40 years while preaching to some of the largest gatherings the world has ever seen. As the founder of Christ For All Nations, Reinhard has passed the torch and his microphone to Daniel. And like Elijah to Elisha, there has been an increase of the Spirit's work. God not only isn't slowing down, but there has been nearly doubled the amount of salvations in each crusade since Reinhard was leading. Daniel's church is the dirt fields of the crusade. The walls are the country borders. And the pews have been removed to make room for the hundreds of thousands that gather in anticipation of an encounter with God. But before the city of Tamale can see a mighty move of God, Daniel's incredible team needs to take a raw, untamed field and turn it into an amphitheater that will hold over a quarter of a million people. These tireless, brilliant engineers, mechanics, administrators, and film crew are some of the best in the world at what they do, often put in near impossible situations. They also come alongside thousands of local churches to make it possible for hundreds of thousands to hear about Jesus. It was becoming clear to me this wasn't just a backyard tent revival. This was a Gospel crusade ready to shake an entire city. One of the many people I met behind the scenes was Winfried Wentland, a former Green Beret in the German Army, Winny, as they call him, has spent the last 30 years ensuring the Gospel Crusade goes off without a hitch. He has been captured by rebel soldiers, has been repeatedly shot, survived the plane crash, and has nearly died countless times all because, as he puts it, the Lord told him to just get in the truck and drive. Reinhard always said, and Daniel also said, that he can't do his work and his calling without us. And we have been through many countries which are very good, and we have been to some countries where we had experienced war, civil war, unrest, riots, government turn over. I remember a country when I entered one side of the border, the president was still in power. When I left the country on the other side, he was already removed from power. When I have rebel soldiers with rebels on the country, I saw that time is over. We saw already the heads on the floor lying from other people. So there was nothing you can be proud of. you see how difficult it is. But you can only trust Jesus. And then He made a way. That is where I thought over 200,000 people on the field. Many people gave their life to Jesus. The president came. The parliament came. Reinhard spoke in the parliament. What would be happening if we would have said, we're going back? We would not have seen it. I'm probably a little bit biased in this way as an evangelist, but I really believe that what moves the heart of God is souls. The true test of one's relationship with God is not how loud you sing. It's not how high you dance in the worship. It's how much your heart burns for the loss. Creation cost God nothing. When He spoke the world into existence, He didn't break a sweat. He didn't strain a muscle. He simply spoke and everything came into existence. Creation cost him nothing. But salvation, our salvation, cost Him everything. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): The crusade grounds were nearly ready. Months of planning had led up to this. And Daniel was just arriving, ready to go. But as soon as he got off the plane, Daniel was told that the King of Tamale wanted to meet him in person. This meeting with the king wasn't a friendly photo op. It carried massive ramifications. If the king doesn't like what is said, or if he, a Muslim, is offended by the name of Jesus, then the king would refuse to receive Daniel and the message he brings to the city. The king, with one word, could send everyone home. No crowds would gather. No demonstration of the power of God and no proclamation of the Gospel for the salvation of thousands who desperately needed it. After months of work, thousands of man hours and preparation, millions of dollars spent, it all came down to this meeting and this king. I was starting to understand why we had received a military escort and why armed soldiers led the barricade. We were not just headed into a palace, we were headed into a battlefield. DANIEL KOLENDA: Finally, we come out of these dark corridors into sort of an open courtyard. And there in front of us is a circular room that was-- I guess it was the throne room of the king. Through the small doors we could see, as our eyes adjusted to the light, a king sitting on his throne. There were a bunch of older men sitting in a semicircle at his feet. These are the tribal elders. They welcomed us to their village. They thanked us for coming. And then the king invites me to address him. In that situation, my number one goal is to see the people of that tribe come to the crusade, to hear the Gospel. And that includes the king himself. And so I will give him a personal invitation to come to the crusade. And I want to give an accurate representation of Jesus and of what we're there to do to the leaders. So I'm always praying in those situations that the Lord would give me an open door to be able to demonstrate the kingdom in a way that the people will be able to see and understand without becoming confrontational. And so that's exactly what happened in that hut. Well, your Royal Highness, I greet you in the wonderful name of Jesus. I thank you for your very warm welcome and for your hospitality. It is a great honor for us to be here in your palace, to be welcomed into your kingdom. The word of God, the Holy Bible, says that we should fear God and honor the king. And so that's why we're here, to honor you. And we have come here this week as preachers of the Gospel. And the Gospel means good news. Have you heard the good news? Well I'm here to tell you the good news. The good news, Your Highness, is that Jesus loves you. That He came from heaven to earth for you. That He died upon the cross for you. That He rose from the dead for you. And that because of that, you can have salvation. And as I was sitting there, I just had this scripture come into my heart from the book of 1 John Chapter 5. And it says in verse 11 that "this is the record, that God has given unto us eternal life. And that life is in His son, Jesus Christ. He that hath the son, hath life. And he that hath not the son, hath not life." And so it is my prayer that you and that all of your subjects and that this entire land would come to experience that eternal life through Jesus Christ. And I just want to say as the evangelist, I want to give you, Your Royal Highness, a personal invitation to come to the Gospel meetings this week. I believe this is going to be a life-changing week. In Jesus' name, thank you for your welcome. And God bless you. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): That was it. The name of Jesus hung in the air. And now all we could do was wait as the king talked to his herald. One of the chiefs whispered into my ear, and he said, the king is suffering with a sickness in his knees. He hasn't been able to walk in several days. Will you pray for him? And I said, well, will he let me pray for him? Isn't that a coincidence that just a couple of days ago he got sick like this and now I'm here, a perfect opportunity to be able to show the power of the name of Jesus and the power of the kingdom. Jesus Didn't heal the sick to prove that He could. He healed the sick to prove that we could. He did miracles to show us how we can live our lives. He healed the sick. He demonstrated the kingdom. And then he said, this is what the Kingdom of God is. He healed the sick. He opened the eyes of the blind. He raised the dead. And then He taught them the kingdom. On the one hand, He was explaining it to us. On the other hand, He was showing it to us. And all of it was an invitation to enter into it. He was saying, this is what I want you to do. This is how you can live. This is how you can be. So [INAUDIBLE]. Yeah. So we can pray for him now? OK. Right now? [INAUDIBLE] WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): But instead of a yes or no, the king made a shocking request. As the king explained how he no longer could stand because of his knee pain, Daniel could see what God was up to. Daniel, unshaken by the request, seeing immediately this was God's plan all along, turn to me with quiet confidence and said-- You'll want to get this. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): And then something wholly unexpected happen. The king, who only speaks to people through a herald, is always surrounded by guards, invited Daniel to come up and pray for him. A foreigner, after preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, still holding his Bible, was being summoned to come up to the throne of a Muslim king and physically lay hands on him. He has not been able to stand up. His knees, he has pains. If he's going to get up, strong people have to hold him to get up. DANIEL KOLENDA: Can we pray for him? [INAUDIBLE]. So he's asking for the prayer so that we pray for what-- Can we come? WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): This might be the King of Tamale, but shockingly, he was now asking help from the King of Kings. Lord, I thank you. In the name of Jesus, Lord, I thank you for healing in these knees. I speak to these knees. I command them to be healed right now in the name of Jesus. All pain, get out, in Jesus' name. All arthritis, go right now. In the name of Jesus. Be healed. Be healed. Can I move this? Yes. In the name of Jesus, would you stand? Stand. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): And because of this one miracle, they came. Lord, I thank you for complete healing in those knees. All pain, go, in Jesus' name. From the top of your head to the soles of your feet, total healing [INAUDIBLE] right now, in Jesus' name. How do you feel? Ask him if the pain is still there? [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Tell him to walk with me. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): Because their king received healing, because he was shown that he was loved and that Jesus died for him, they received Jesus as Savior. DANIEL KOLENDA: Take my hand. Take my hand. Walk in Jesus' name. In Jesus' name-- in Jesus' name, all that pain, go. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): A king takes a step and lives are changed forever. When I started this journey, I wanted to see God move for myself. But throughout it all, one constant phrase kept rising in my soul, He is worth it. He is worth facing arrest and persecution. He is worth acting in obedience to the whispers of your heart. He is worth forsaking your own life, even when no one will ever know your name. He is worth face from the demons of your past. He is worth facing down a king. Lord, thank you for total healing right now, in the name of Jesus. WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): You are worthy, oh, Lord, to receive glory and honor and power, for you have created all things. What are we that you would concern yourself with us Who are we that you would visit us in our brokenness? We are all broken. But you have proven over and over again that you are not just the King of Kings, but you are also the King of the Broken. Jesus Lord, Lord, thank you for total healing right now, in the name of Jesus. [INAUDIBLE] The astounding thing I learned years ago that I wish I would have learned earlier in life is that God lights the fire on the altar, but it is the priests that keep it burning. God ignites the fires of revival. How long it lasts depends on us. It'll last as long as it is an offering. But if you can't find an offering, jump on the altar because that fire will fall on you. And it won't stop. [CRYING] INTERVIEWER: That's all I got. Me, too. [CHUCKLES] WILL HACKER (VOICEOVER): We are all broken in one way or another. And God longs to meet us not always in the way we want, but truly in the way we need. As the lights were being turned off, when the field was empty, I talked with a woman named Sarah who I had seen throughout the crusade. I asked what she thought God had done here and if she was disappointed in Him at all? What did she think of God's glory now? She came in a wheelchair and was now going home still in a wheelchair. So I learned that faith works in love. That I have to-- I can't hate the same God I wanted to do something for me. And I had to trust Him. It's a test in our faith. I'm not ready to back down. And I guess when I get home tomorrow, they'll be like, oh, that's not what we expected. But I have been begging God to heal the people around me of their own belief so that they can see beyond the physical. But at the end of the day, I'm going with something much more. Yesterday I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. And I just feel complete, like that anger, that anxiety, and uncertainty, it's not there anymore. I'd rather just stay in His will the way He wants it than stay on my own and be miserable. The devil has been telling me, oh,ho, he didn't show up, you know? Don't even come today. Just go home. It's done. I told you so. But faith is a fight. so just saying that some people actually give their life to Christ. It was worth it, knowing that Christ in us, the hope of glory. I've always deserved the gift of the Spirit. And I got it so it's worth it. I still witness miracles. And our timing is not God's timing. But when it's His time, He makes all things beautiful. It was all worth it. It was all worth it. [MUSIC PLAYING]
