Go ahead Your apartment is pretty big For a person who lives alone It's my dad's apartment But he works in Mainland Doesn't come back often You have so many LEGO sets There must be 100 boxes No way near 100 I stopped buying legos after I bought a car I'm just working on legos I've previously bought You have so many cup noodles And a freezer full of microwaveable meals They're all different flavours Hello? What is it? This again? Are you done? Alright, whatever, are you done talking? Who was that? The office? No I've never seen you so angry before It's nothing, it's just my dad You always talk to your dad like that? Do you hate him? He treats you well enough Allowing you to live in such a big apartment Nice decor I pay him rent He renovated the place so he could get rid of my mom's stuff But your mom passed away a long time ago, right? Yeah Does that mean he can get rid of her stuff? He just wants to sell the house And renovated the place while I was traveling abroad So I chose to live here Then he won't be able to sell it He likes money So I pay rent that's above market price After, he's still your dad He never cared about this family Thinking he's the shit, just by earning some money in Mainland Whatever, I don't wanna talk about it What are you doing? I think you have lice here You have so many toys I've been bitten as soon as I got in here You're a girl Can you be more lady like? What? What did you see? My undies? You'll be happy, wouldn't you?

I thought her family was broke Guess they're doing well Finally, someone who doesn't live so far away Don't you guys agree? "Hau: I'm arriving Central, don't worry" Why are you here? I'm a journalist It's not unusual that I'd be in central Should I drive you back to Cha Kwo Ling? You can give it a try A try? Why doesn't it work? I came back from an interview from La mm a Island And saw your car parked here Doors locked But the lights still on Five minutes ago They turned off as well Shit Ran out of battery I already called Jude Calling me in such a hurry Did you miss me? Hau, do you need a girlfriend right now? Or this external car battery?

I didn't question why you parked your car here You could've asked You're a grown man No need to explain yourself Did Lisa tell you... Jude Law, can you keep a secret? What's going on? You ask him yourself So you dated Lisa before? I thought you said his sister was your first love? Are you kidding me? I thought we were brothers You've never told me before And I've never told your wife about it See how good I am to you? Alright then, I'll tell her Should Hau tell her, or do you wanna tell her yourself?

It's so nice to have a colleague Drive me after seeing a client Thank you You're welcome I'll see you tomorrow What are you doing? Let me walk you It's just a few steps to the pier I wanna send you back to Cheung Chau Why? Um... Um... you're stuttering You know that if you send me home It'll take you two hours to get back I know that Right, then Why? Can't I? Sure... Sure you can Let's go Do you guys recognize this pier? Does it feel familiar? But let me tell you guys Melanie doesn't live in Cheung Chau "See Ranch"? It's Sea Ranch Right, "Sea" I haven't heard of it either Sea Ranch is located on Lantau Island Luxury houses at dirt cheap prices Dead dogs found in the abandoned clubhouse This was an article from three years ago Ruins photography right there The clubhouse is in ruins But the residential area is still operational It's just like Tai O You're an impressive man The last two girls you've dated require a permit for you to drive there That's not true You can't reach Sea Ranch by car Right Jude, where's your sister, ie. my wife? It's beautiful here You can even see the ocean We used to play up here when we're kids Did Hau send you home? Yeah, he took me as far as Cheung Chau He made sure I got on the ferry to Sea Ranch And then he took the ferry back to Central That doesn't mean anything though What? That doesn't mean anything? Before they seal the deal All the boys would take me back to Cheung Chau Once we make it official They'll tell me to move out of Sea Ranch Some say it after a week Some after a month Some after a whole season They'd suggest I stay over at their respective places But that's not enough So we ended up breaking up Three bedrooms, with an ocean view Isolated from society I can't live without Wi-Fi They have Wi-Fi nowadays But not as cheap as $1 million like before Taking the ferry there And then driving back Would take you longer than flying to Kaohsiung Weren't you set on Taipei? There was originally a ferry directly from Central Sea Ranch was a big deal back then In the 80's All the foreign CEOs lived there It was a holiday home for the local wealthy people My friend lived there before That's Law's House We hear they might keep it after the redevelopment I hope so And over there That beautiful rooftop right there Is my husband Tung's home Why is it so run down now? Two groups of homeowners started a war Ended up in court They lost the clubhouse And the direct ferry from Central So people moved out And now it's become mostly abandoned They even have a bowling alley Hau, your new girlfriend lives there Therefore she's quite something She's not my girlfriend yet Hau's never bring a girl back to Cha Kwo Ling before We're not officially together yet Besides, I was the one who wanted to visit I think he's only been in two relationships The girl took initiative both times Her parents prefer the seclusion There's restricted access Brother B, you got it right Hau's girlfriend used to be a celebrity From riches to rags Do you know what happened to his family? I don't know the full story You know he lives in Hong Sing Garden, right? This I know And everyone from our class knows that His mom died at 5 years old His mom died when he was 5 years old Did you think this was a soap opera? He was born in Hong Sing Garden But his dad worked in Mainland a lot So he lived in Cha Kwo Ling, where his grandparents lived I didn't know that And when he was in university, his grandparents passed away His father remarried and had kids in Mainland You know what happened in the 2nd year of university? Tung was majoring in communications at Shue Yan So he would go take photos in Mong Kok And we'd bring Hau with us He was down in the dumps at that time We were afraid he couldn't graduate He never told me any of this Well, you guys aren't officially together just yet Right It takes time for him to warm up Give him some time And he'll eventually tell you everything I hope so They're here Let's go Aren't you gonna take me to see that rock? Do you want kids already? Nope, probably not Who'd wanna bring a child Into the world that we're living in? Unless we can move to another country Have you thought about it? How can I not think about it? Which means we can't play video games tonight Count me out I need to rest I've been pulling all-nighters this week Otherwise, my colleagues are covering for me And Gigi has a night shift at the hospital Exactly Hello Melanie Welcome to our diner Did you guys grow up in the same village? Yeah Yeah They turned out so different This diner is beautiful, like it's from the last century Thanks for your appreciation How long has this village been around? Don't ask me This village dates back 400 years So what? The Small House Policy doesn't apply Nga Tsin Wai Village still got torn down, despite being 600 years old This is Hong Kong This place might get torn down in a few years Re-calibration Successful Your location: Cheung Chau Those orange rooftops That's Sea Ranch Oh... When you send me home at night That's the little light in the dark Please take the free licensed ferry from the Cheung Chau public pier This ferry doesn't go to Sea Ranch What are you up to? Get on the boat first, Melanie Sometimes I would think that There are many possibilities in life I've always wanted to tell Melanie this story After my ex-colleague Rex met his girlfriend Sarah He quit his job and traveled the world They bought a boat and started doing local tours I wonder how Melanie would like to live her life "Wing: Fleur's found a man‚Äù Here's a pic as proof Be careful, it's hot and heavy Thank you I've always thought that I liked girls who were similar to me But when I'm together with Melanie I feel really comfortable Have I changed? You got a little something... Don't move Time to come clean Where are you taking me? I know The beach is that way Have a little patience In any case, I had a great time today You know you've already said that three times? Have I? I hope you didn't get the wrong idea I don't like celebrating birthdays Please don't expect a huge wedding banquet Besides, my parents won't enjoy socializing But dinner tonight on a boat Was much more special than a candlelit dinner Do you always have candlelit dinners? More often than you, What? What's A2? You don't know this term? A means "available" Which means you're single "2" is how many relationships you've been in Weren't you working on a dating app? So what now? That way Are you introducing me to new friends? Patience, Melanie Patience... I haven't worked out in so long I'm tired Is this it? Hand me your bag Melanie... Happy birthday What is this? If you ever miss your ferry You can stay the night here I've made up my mind I'm moving to Cheung Chau To be closer to you Will you be my girlfriend? What do you see me as? A booty call that you can just summon over? Do I seem that casual to you? What do you like about me? I'm so talkative, and you're so quiet Don't take it the wrong way That's not what I meant I... think we're very comfortable together You've made me more talkative Comfortable? That's what all guys say at first "We're so comfortable together‚Äù What were you saying just now? Patience! You'll get sick of me in no time Then it'll become uncomfortable And you'd think I'm annoying and noisy Sea Ranch is fucking far I've been in many more relationships than you have You'll tell me to move back to the city Don't live so far away What do I do? Do I abandon my parents? I've never asked you to send me home And I've never asked you to move in here What are you doing? Why did you move here? What about your car and Hong Sing Garden? Isn't that part of your childhood memory? Or you're used to Cha Kwo Ling village And you wanna live in a village house Then why don't you move to Tai O with your ex? Or go to Lai Chi Wo to meet that goddess of yours? That's right, you never told me any of that You were never willing to tell me You thought I was in the dark? I know everything You only like pretty girls What's the point in that? Pretty girls get old And their beauty will fade No one will like them anymore I'm sorry I send you home because I wanna spend more time with you My car... I rented a parking space in Sheung Wan My dad always wanted to sell Hong Sing Garden So now I'm letting him sell it It's time for me to establish my own home What year is it? Do boys have to send girls home? Why can't girls protect themselves? What if the assailant had a knife? You'd just be able to stand there and watch me get raped I'm sorry, Melanie I hadn't considered your feelings But I've thought it through I know exactly what I want Oh... I suck I wanted to keep pretending I was mad But I couldn't help but laugh No wonder I couldn't be an actor What? You wanna be my boyfriend? What? What's happening? I'm messing with you Will you still take me? Shit... Are you crazy? I was scared shit less Makes this more memorable Did you have to go that far? I wanna be clear You moved here because you didn't wanna long-D Although I was acting just now I really appreciate you sending me to Cheung Chau I'll keep doing it if you like it Although it's a bit far away from work I can change jobs But I can't change my girlfriend Is it that easy to change? If I can't find a job Then we can head to Central Pier together I'm talking about your girlfriend That's right Alright Let's head to the roof There must be something corny up there Hey hey... don't... There really is That's so corny Is it really that corny? But I like it What is this? It's a light that you can see from Sea Ranch That's impressive Yeah, I got you the exact same one We can communicate through morse code Morse code? Which era are you from? That's so corny, gosh But that's okay It's quite romantic We can give it a shot Is this fake? Yeah Fire hazard And this is getting floppy Have you thought of moving to another country? That was a sudden topic change Answer the question first Jude has a British National (Overseas) passport He wants to go study fashion Tung and Gigi are probably moving to Taiwan But I haven't really thought about it Why not? There's nowhere that's really worth moving to And the 'where' is not the most important Most important is 'who' you go with Let me be clear If you leave, you have to take your in-laws with you Sure, we stick together So, I've said yes to your question Why don't you kiss me? You've killed the whole vibe You're really not gonna kiss me? That's so not romantic Who's the one being unromantic?
