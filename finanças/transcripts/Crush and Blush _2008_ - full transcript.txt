That shouldn't matter. I thought a lot about why he isn't taking my calls. He must be suffering 'cuz he's so in love with me. Like in movies when a man is suffering over a woman, he falls to pieces and turns to prostitutes? Men sometimes want to crawl into their own little caves. Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus So I tried to do exactly that. Don't call him But I'm worried, doctor. I'm not calling him on purpose. But what if he thinks I'm not calling for no reason?

I don't even know what he looks like. At least mom died after giving birth to me. You're an orphan? By the way... How did your parents meet? Mom's 8 years older than dad. When mom was 29 she hit a cab riding drunk on a motorcycle. She was hospitalized for over a year. Dad was a college student volunteering at the hospital. That's when their eyes met. Then what? We're not lovers with secrets! Tell me! Well, it gets kind of x-rated. Tell me! I like dirtythings! Well... my mom got pregnant with me. In a patient room for 8! Really... Not only that... Her body was covered in bandages. What? Is it possible to do it like that? Of course it is! Then what about me! Mom knew she was pregnant and asked dad to marry her. How? She said just one thing. Take responsibility for getting her pregnant? Grow up, will ‘ya? You really got me. That's it? I can't do this anymore! Change of strategy! I can't wait any longer! Show me! Right now! You are my lighter. A lighter? You put my body on ﬁre! Hot chemistry! She's undoing another button. She's wearing a sexy bra! What the hell are they doing? Dad's here. Ms. Lee? You wanted to see me?

I am scared! Then I realized... pulling myself away was difficult. There is something much bigger and higher than this. Free will to make me stronger. My wife is much hotter. It's over. Jong-chul Suh As many days go by... Thank you for everything. We don't have to do the show, anymore. When I should feel lonely... Hail comes tapping at my window. Then I would kneel before the furnace... and think of a lone rock in a distant mountain And the dried leaves awaiting the snow. Soft crackles... and remember... I don't think age matters to be good friends. We know what each other's thinking without saying. She'll go on typing it, so that my fingers won't hurt. Then I'll keep typing it so that hers won't hurt. lfl keep typing 'bigger' fast... it turns into 'bugger' or 'booger'. I make typos all the time. But she always gets it right! - Have you ever tried it? - No. It's funny. You should try it. Don't tell her we're moving offices next week! Keep typing it fast... and you'll get 'bugger' and 'booger'. Try it! Can you move if your body's all bandaged up? Of course you can't! - Then how can you do it? - Do what? Get out of the way! What possible positions are there for a woman covered in bandages and a man? It's very important to me. Only serious answers, please. The hell would I know! Shit! Crazy idiot! They must be crazy! - Me-sook? - Yeah? Mr. Suh's acting strange. He breaks up with me, then writes me. He dumps me again and now he text messages me! What does it say? I didn't hear from you since that day so I thought it was over. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jong-chul Suh. 'Thought it was over'? Does that mean it's not over? No, he means from before. Before? When? When I went to get you instead of him at that pub. He didn't say it was over, then! No, but he told me flat out. His wife wanted a divorce. I knew that it's over between us then. But he didn't say it was over! Oh, Me-sook. You don't have to actually say 'it's over' to know. When you get the feeling it's over, then it is. Why don't you say it flat out if you're dating him or not! You're no celebrity! Why are you being sulky? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I thought you knew. I'm sorry, Me-sook. I'd better go. He's drinking alone. I need to talk things out with him. Don't go, Ms. Lee! Don't you have any pride! I've always been like this, Me-sook. They all come after me first. But when I tell them I like them too, they all dump me within 75 days! l regretted it a lot this time. I gave it a lot of thought. I even did some research. I told you, men do things for no reason! Just get over it! Mr. Suh and I really need to talk it out. Don't worry about me. And don't wait up. Yu-ri! No! It's dangerous out there! At least tell me where you're meeting so I won't worry. I'm going to that pub. Don't worry and sleep tight. Your dad and Yuri are about to meet! We must stop 'em! Your dad and Yu-ri are about to meet! I think you're still beautiful mom! Thank you very much. Bye. Jong-hee Suh My little girl Who are you? It's still me, Me-sook. No. Stop lying, Yu-ri. No, it's still me, Me-sook. Mr. Byun? Hello? Go on in. This is hilarious! You look so funny! Happy? Shouldn't this motel make its sign out of gold? Make the letters a lot bigger? The biggest out of all the motels? And make that out of gold. That one, too. This should be a five-star-motel. 'Cuz we're here. Did you... see Ms. Lee by chance? Mr. Byun. I'm destined to be lonely all my life. How do you feel towards me? Thankful and sorry. You lie... Why would I lie to you, Ms. Yang? Thankful and sorry? You sent me messages 'cuz you're just thankful and sorry? And attached special symbols on them? And on Wal-sun's last day of school... What was the hug for? I hugged who? Wal-sun Um! My student who moved away two years ago! - Look, Ms. Yang... - What! I don't remember that girl. And what special symbols? Please don't do this to me. Attacking is the best defense You've got a message. You've got a message. You've got a message. You're not talking about... the automatic symbols at the end of messages are you? Don't sleep during staff meetings. Automatic symbols? I cancelled that last month. After a free month, I cancelled it. They're for kids. I'm so sorry! I take early morning English classes. You ugly rat! But it was real for us in the beetle last, last, last, last year! Then I realized... Pulling myself away was difﬁcult. There is something much bigger and higher than this. Free will to make me stronger. As many days go by... Sadness and grief all melt away. I love you, hon. Won-sung Girls Middle and High School Festival D-3 Ms. Yang! Ms. Yang! My dad didn't come home last night! It's her! Me-sook! Good morning! No! Stop! Go to class! Now! Let me handle this. Hurry up! Go! Me-sook! I wasn't with Suh! I met a girl friend by chance!

Stop lying! What are you saying? You mean Ms. Yang's father is really dead? Of course he is! Why would she lie about that? She's human! Yu-ri Lee! lwish she's dead! That's a pretty big lie... But if it's not a lie... Then that means she was with her dead father. That's crazy. And she sure wasn't with me. That means she was with Mr. Suh. Oh no, Mrs. Suh. I really hope Me-sook's father is alive. Hello? Hello? Mrs. Suh? Excuse me. Beef cabbage rolls are served. It's a healthy Chinese dish... I'll serve it to you. Eun-kyo Sung speaking. Don't call up someone and hang up on her! Thought I'd be scared if you called me with voice modulation? Who is this? Me-sook Yang has got you fooled! Yu-ri Lee didn't sleep with Jong-chul Suh! He slept with Me-sook Yang! [knew there was something ﬁshy between them! Asking him to drive her home and what not. It must've been more exciting between a former teacher and student. Hello? She hung up on me again! Hello! Damn it! Eat before it gets cold, dear. - Excuse me? - Yes? Where's the dermatologist that used to be here? They moved out last week. Where did they go?

Language Lab Then that means... Ms. Yang's been backbiting me to Jong-hee, and backbiting Mr. Suh to me, then backbiting me to you all this time! And she's the one who called me using voice modulation! To tell me she slept with Mr. Suh! Why would she? To brag! Do all thatjust to brag? I'm the one who called! 'Cuz I thought dad was with Yu-ri Lee. I thought they slept together. Everyone put on your headphones. Can you hear me? It's okay. As long as you didn't get infected with anything. How was it? Horrible. Why'd you sleep with Ms. Yang when you liked Ms. Lee? When you brought up divorce I ended things with Ms. Lee that night! That's not true! You wanted an intimate relationship after that!

And she didn't pay for the utilities when she lived with me! When people do something strange, there's a reason to it. She's a human, too! Thank you. Now. Tell me. About what? Why'd you do it, Ms. Yang? First, lwanna set something straight! I stayed up all night with Jong-hee then went to my English class at dawn! After teaching, I went straight to belly dancing! Then I met Jong-hee at nights. I was hardly at Yu-ri's! I had no time to wash at home! So I washed my hair at school! How can anyone survive a schedule like that? You can't get any rest or eat like that! lcan! I took a nap in the nurse's room at lunch time. [had no time to eat 'cuz of my morning English classes. [had no time to sleep at night so I took naps at lunch. Since I didn't have time for lunch, [survived on snacks. [had no time for dinner 'cuz of the dancing classes. I met Jong-hee right after class so I had no time to eat dinner. Ichatted on line with Yu-ri all night and also practiced for the show! Ibarely survived on what Jong-hee brought over. You're a human being... how can you hurt Jong-hee by sleeping with her father? I didn't sleep with him, knowing I'm sorry. But that doesn't mean I wasn't sorry! It's just... I felt something in the elevator... I know you can't really trust such a subjective excuse. But why does everyone believe Ms. Lee? She goes around babbling on about feeling it and all. I know! Ms. Lee is good and I'm ugly! I know I'm ugly! If I were Yu-ri, you all wouldn't be doing this! But since I'm Me-sook, everyone ignores me! Let's talk about this at home, hon!

Just.... pretended he was asleep. That's it? Yup. Don't cry Jong-hee! Please. I'll go back in and tell them the truth. That your dad didn't come on to me. And that the feelings were mutual. That I liked it, too. I'm so sorry. What are you talking about? That's what you'll say in there? Like this? And this? And show it to my mom? But that's the truth. You hate me now, don't you? Okay. Me-sook Yang! Do exactly as I tell you. Well, uh.... Inside the beetle last, last, last, last year... You must remember Mr. Suh? How you licked up my ear? Who me? And stuck your tongue in and out. ldid? You sucked on my earlobe... and whispered romantically... Romantically? You're so delicious! I hate you dad! I swear I didn't do it, hon. Wait! Let me get this straight. You sexually harassed your co-worker! Will you smarten up, if you get sued? It wasn't sexual harassment! The hell it wasn't! Ms. Yang... Can't you tell the difference between molestation and expression of love? I felt it was an expression of love! Then you must really be in love. Spread the seeds of love Spread the seeds of love everywhere Mothers, fathers, everyone spread the seeds of love First, you should get over Jong-chul completely, Ms. Yang. I'm divorcing him as of today, too. Too bad. Guess you're going behind bars, dear. Why? He should pay for his crime! I'll pay for a good lawyer to sue him! - Mom! - Mrs. Suh! It was all a lie! If it was a lie... that means a teacher and student... schemed together to end a marriage. Who'd believe that? No one! People make mistakes! How can their feelings never change! It takes effort! Sometimes they need a break! Fine! I stopped for a sec and made a mistake! Like you never made one mistake in your life! Was I a mistake, too? Grow up will you, Ms. Lee! Meeting you in that hospital was my best mistake ever! Then Jong-hee was born and everything was great! So let's drop this, please? I know everything! I know I'm adopted! No! You're our daughter! Stop lying! How can you do it when mom was covered in bandages? I studied and researched it! That's impossible! It's possible! Everything's possible if you're in love. Please, forgive me, hon. I'll explain it all to you later. Mom... I'm so sorry about everything! You talk about making mistakes. So I guess my accident was a mistake and you volunteering, too? Jong-hee being born and everything's all a mistake? Poor Me-sook. Are you okay? I know how you must feel. I'm sorry, Me-sook. Me, too! Please! Include me in, Mrs. Suh! Please! Forgive me. Forgive you for what, Ms. Yang? So you're not going to sue my Jong-chul? No! And stop stalking him? Then... what is it you want? Not sure. What do you want from him? I never really thought about it. You chased a married man for 4 years and never thought about it? Well, I've been really busy. Let's set things straight once and for all. 10 minutes should be enough to decide, right? How can I even think about thinking. Starting now! Relax your body completely. Concentrate breathing with the lower abdomen. Inhale slowly and deeply. Exhale in soft, short breaths. With relaxed breathing, concentrate on your heart. A calm heart void of foolishness. One. Take Mr. Suh and be a home wrecker. Or two. Forget him and make a fresh start. What'll it be, Ms. Yang? Wait. l have one last question. Did you ever feel like calling me, Mr. Suh? For no reason? Not once. Actually, that's what I thought. But I wanted to call you everyday. For no reason. I chose number 2. A fresh start. Next up is 'Loser and Her Lover' team. Where is 'Loser and Her Lover' team? Let's not do this, Jong-hee! They'll think we gave up 'cuz of embarrassment! Where is 'Loser and Her Lover' team? Are you giving up? Last call for 'Loser and Lover'! No one cares about people like us! But I care! But I'm... I'm so embarrassed of myself. Stop it! I'm not embarrassed of you! Stop whining! Really? 'Loser and Lover' team has given up. Next up is... Loser! Loser! Loser! Loser! Becoming One World Festival! Loser! Loser! Loser! Loser! We practiced hard like everyone else! And thank you. Thank you. Not at all. Yes yes. No no. Hello? Yes yes. No no. ldon't seem to be able to depart. Such is life. Thank you. They even threw us toilet paper and stones! I wonder what part we did was so good! We were so cool all the way! So messed up! This is only one bag that l have. The following spring Now... What do I do with my life? Hey doc, are you married? Stop it! Are you married or not? Say it! No... You really got me. My face was ﬂushed red. Stick skinny with mad, curly hair. I was so shy. My red face... No one took notice. How much redder mustlbe to be noticed? How angry must I be to get red? I was so shy. Nineteen-years-old. [had one little wish. Though my face is red... Please, listen to me. Just once
