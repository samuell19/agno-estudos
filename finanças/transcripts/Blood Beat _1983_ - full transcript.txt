Come on. It's a nice one, too. Really nice deer. I was up at the pines this morning, it was just getting light and I came in the woods and I saw four or five of them right off the bat but I couldn't get close to them. About 20 minutes ago I was getting hungry and I was getting tired. What's the matter? Honey, you've seen all kinds of dead deer before. Honey. - I'm sorry. - Now calm down. Have you got a bad migraine? Calm down now, that's alright. That's alright. Let's go have some coffee, what'd you say? _ okay- - What time do the kids come? - [Cathy] In a couple of hours. - Don't move, be quiet, I've got great news. I'm going to tell them that I'm going to marry their mother! - [Cathy] Oh no. No no. I told you so many times I don't wanna get married again. No, I won't. - Cathy, but listen. - Listen. Don't talk to me about it anymore. Gary, wait a minute. Gary, listen. We can go on like this, can't we? We're okay, wherever we are. We're okay. (peaceful orchestral music) - Alright. Ted, how are ya? - How you doing? What's up? - Gary! - Dolly! You look good. You two look great! - Nice deer. Where'd you get him? - I got him up in the pines. Same place you got that buck two years ago, remember, the little one? - Oh yeah, that was a good one. - Alright, here's Sleeping Beauty. - This is a good friend of mine, Sarah. This is Gary. - Oh I'm sorry, my hands are still bloody. Don't be afraid. And call me Gary please. - It's food. - [Dolly] Where's mom? She painting? - No, she's in the house. - Not anymore. - Mom! - My baby! Ni I missed you. - [Ted] I'd like you to meet Sarah, mom. (eerie instrumental music) - Sarah. You're welcome here. - Sarah. Grab one of those cookies before Dolly. - [Dolly] Mom, can I go in the bedroom? - [Cathy] Sure, I didn't move anything. - [Dolly] Save me a cookie. Wow, look at the Christmas tree. Come here, look at the tree! - Hey, that's a nice one. Sarah, check out my gun. - [Sarah] Are these the paintings your mom does? - Yeah. She painted that one, that one, not that one. Pretty bizarre, she, she spends hours in that room almost hypnotized. It's pretty nice, they look good in here. Don't worry about that. These are just some old traditional decorations of my mom's. - Well tradition's very nice sometimes. How about some music? - [Sarah] Sure. - [Ted] When you're at school, you don't get a chance to do any hunting. - [Dolly] Look at this, this one's for me, this one's for me, this one's for me, and this one's for Sarah. - Sarah? - Yeah. - Gary, how'd you know that Sarah was coming? - [Gary] I didn't know. I knew it. - Mama, how'd you even know Sarah was coming? - A mother knows everything. Would you like some coffee Sarah? - [Sarah] Yes, please. (energetic orchestral music) - Here we are. This is your little nest. Like it? It's the old guest room. Nobody's stayed here in quite sometime. Still some old stuff from an old friend of mom's. (baby crying) Some psycho analyst or something like that. Meditation he called it. One day he just packed up and left. Just a few lines on a piece of paper and that was it. But that was the last we ever heard of him. I didn't know him that well, he was a little strange. - [Sarah] Where is she now? - Where is who? - Your mom. - Ma? - Yeah. You said she was cool. Come on, Ted. - She is cool. Wanna give me a little hand here? She is cool you know but, I mean Dolly's so doggone stupid. I mean she comes home, and tells ma she's quitting school as soon as we doggone arrive. I mean what kind of timing is that? Right before Christmas. - I don't know. I just felt really weird around your mom. Did you see the way she looked at me? I was real scared. - Don't let that bother you. She just likes to impress my friends. - I don't know. - Don't be scared of my mom. What's the matter with you? - I don't know, I just feel kinda weird. - What do you mean? - Well I feel like she knows everything that goes inside of my head. (mumbles) She reads everything in my mind, she scrutinizes me. - Scrutinizes you. (eerie whooshing) - I'm sorry. It's stupid, I must be tired. (eerie whooshing) It's like I feel she's in the room right now. In the room with us. - Come on Sarah, she's downstairs in her studio, paintin okay? - I just feel it, Ted. I don't know. (building orchestral music) (eerie whooshing) Stop it. Ted, stop it. - What's the matter? - Just no, I can't. I can't. Stop. Stop it. - What's the matter? What's the matter Sarah? - I don't know. I just feel some weird things. It's like she's in the room right now with us. - Come on Sarah, she's painting. What are you talking about? - Ted. - Come on, it's alright. She's downstairs. She's not up here. (gentle orchestral music) - [Radio] Breaker one four, breaker one four. - [Pete] Red Baron to Lone Painter. You got the red Baron here, Lone Painter, do you read me? - Gary, guess who's coming! Gary, Gary, guess who's coming! - What, who? - Red Baron's coming, he wants to go hunting. - The old mosquito killer, huh? - [Dolly] Yeah. - Yeah yeah, we might have time. I don't know. Hey, do you wanna help? - Alright. - Okay, run it in fast before he gets here, okay? - [Dolly] I'm anxious to go hunting. Think we can go hunting tonight? - Sure we can go hunting. You think you can hit anything? - [Dolly] Yeah, I'm on the archery team. Uncle Pete! - [Pete] Nobody ready? Where are all the deer hunters? (horses galloping) - Are you still mad at me? - Nah. Don't worry about it, doesn't matter. - [Sarah] Ted, I can't hunt. - Carry it. - I decided to go up to the cabin first. So I went across the bridge. I asked him, do you know what he said? - Sign the log. - [Pete] How'd you know that? - I've heard it before. - Yeah, me too. Last Christmas. - Oh yeah. - Okay now look, no more talking. No more big mouth. We hunt, and we hunt quiet. - You bet. - [Dolly] Quiet. - [Pete] Quiet. (soft instrumental music) - I don't like hunting. (heart beating) (soft intense music) (gun cocking) No!

(coughing) (sobbing) (screaming) * Ted! - [Gary] I'm jumping up to stretch, he was about 200 yards from us. I don't even know what the hell he was doing. - You never seen this guys before, have you Gary? - [Gary] Nope, never saw him before. - You sure he's not that poacher? - No no. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm positive, John, I told you. Look, we were 200 yards from him and we shot twice, that's all. Two rifle shots and in the opposite direction. I have no idea what happened. - [John] Didn't you hear a third shot? " [Gary] Nope. I didn't hear anything. - [John] Wait a minute. Are you sure you've never seen this face before? - [Gary] Never saw him before in my life, sheriff. - Doc, how's the, how's the girl? - [Doctor] She'll be fine. I gave her my special treatment. Three asprin and a shot of brandy. - Well, we're gonna list this as a hunting accident. We'll be going, won't bother anymore then, Gary. - Okay John. Thank you much for coming out. - You bet. - Alright, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Oh by the way, Gary, merry Christmas to all of you. (sirens blaring) (sobbing) - I'm so scared of it all. - [Ted] But it's finished, it's done with. Tomorrow's a new day. Just go to sleep tonight. Okay? _ okay- - Go to sleep. - Honey, I love you. - [Ted] I love you too. (soft instrumental music) (bells chiming) - Ted. The pictures, take them with you. - [Ted] Okay. Just go to sleep. (gentle instrumental music) (dramatic choral music) (door knocking) Hi mom. Can I come in? - Sure, Ted, come on in. - Hey that's looking real nice. You know, ma, I just got my car tuned up and I was wondering if-- - Have you seen Gary? - Gary? Oh yeah, he went over to Franks to bring him some medicine. But, I got my car-- - How was he when you saw him? - I don't know, I didn't see him. Pete was with him and he didn't seem to say anything about it. - Well was he angry? - I don't know. Pete didn't say he was, I'm sure Pete would've said something if he was real angry or something. What do you think of, I'd like to get my front fender fixed. - I don't know how to get along with Gary anymore. I don't think I can live with Gary anymore. I love Gary but I love my work. I really don't know what to do. (dramatic choral music) - [Ted] Your work, I don't know. - Ted. How long have you known Sarah? - How long have I known Sarah? Let me think. I don't know, I met her first semester, I've known her for about five months. Why? - I want you to be careful. - Oh mom, I will be careful. I'm not gonna have any kids. - [Cathy] Well, there's something, no, I don't mean that. There's something very strange about Sarah. - What do you mean? - [Cathy] Well, it's really weird, Ted. I fell I've seen her before and I don't know why. I don't understand it. - Well it's probably like dejavu or something. - [Cathy] No. - I experience that sometimes when I see somebody and I think I've seen them before. - You know me Ted, it's more than dejavu. I've seen her before. I know her. (gentle instrumental music) - You know, Dolly, what you said to ma about quitting school was pretty bad timing, you know? Right at Christmas time and everything. Could've been a little more tactful and at least waited till after the holiday. - Give me a break, Ted. What makes you so perfect? (gentle orchestral music) (energetic orchestral music) - [Gary] Cathy, can I come in? - [Cathy] No. No. - I'm going into town a while to pick up some booze. I'll be back in an hour. (gentle orchestral music) (building orchestral music) (soft slamming) - What was that? I'm going to go to the john real quick. - [Cathy] Where's Sarah? - I was just gonna go check on her. (energetic orchestral music) Sarah. Sarah. - Ted. - Are you alright? - I'm okay. - What happened? - I picked up the sword and cut myself. - Sword? What sword, Sarah? - The one in the trunk. - [Ted] Sarah, there's no trunk in this room. - I picked up a, well I opened it and there was a sword and a helmet and a mask. - [Ted] Ma, you don't know if there's any kind of trunk or sword in the house? - [Cathy] No. - It was there, I opened it up and there was a weird outfit, like a helmet and mask and sword, well I cut my finger. - Sarah, you're probably having a nightmare and you just fell out of bed. It's alright. - I guess so. It was so real, I heard you guys playing downstairs like it was happening right now. - Sometimes dreams can seem that real but they were just dreams, you had a nightmare. - I guess so. - Come on, let me get you up into bed. - No no. I'm alright. I don't wanna be alone. Let me stay with you. (energetic orchestral music) (intense orchestral music) - [Gary] Cathy, what's the matter? What's the matter? What the hell's going on around here? Tell me. What's going on? - [Cathy] I can't tell you. I can't. - Dammit, Cathy, will you wake up? What do you think I am anyway? Some kind of piece of plastic that you can just push around and then dispose of me when I'm all finished? Oh I know that you're very bright and your very talented and your very full of visions. But I am not Cathy. I'm just a simple man. I need some attention and I need some affection. Alright, so you don't wanna marry me, that's fine. That's fine! But don't you treat me like some kind of a damn dog waiting for a bone, okay? - Gary, don't talk like that. You don't understand. - Understand! What am I supposed to understand anyway? For the last four to five months I've done everything I can for you. Everything I can. But it's your paints and your brushes and your damn visions. Well I'm fed up. That's right, even the good ole boys get fed up. Have you got the message, sweetheart? Have a nice night, okay? We had a small argument. - [Dolly] Hi mom. - Park place. It'll cost you 1500 bucks, young lady. 1500. - [Dolly] 1500? What? Oh come on. - A hotel on it. - [Dolly] Oh get out of here. - [Ted] 1500. - Mom, where's Uncle Pete? - I don't know. I think he went into town. Must have been a couple hours ago. Don't worry about him, he's okay. I know him really well, he's alright. (energetic orchestral music) - Come on, Ted. Red Baron to Lone Painter. This is an emergency. Mayday, mayday, Red Baron to Lone Painter. This is an emergency. (intense orchestral music) (eerie whooshing) (building intense music) (dramatic eerie music) I'm going to bed. (bells chiming) (coughing) - How come you're not in bed yet? You should be taking that medicine. You're not planning to go hunting tomorrow. - I don't care. Looks like it's gonna be a crappy day tomorrow anyway. - Crappy day or not. I don't wanna be left running this farm alone when you're shot by one of those maniacs. - It was an accident. Gary told you so. That kind of thing happens all the time. Where's the dog? - The dog is out drinking his water. - Get me a cup of tea. - Anything else? - No, that'll be all. And call the dog. (mumbling) - Chookie, Chookie! Come in here. Chookie, come OH. - Chookie, come to me! (eerie whoshing) Atta boy. - Oh, shoot. What's that dog doing on the bed again? I'm so sick of seeing that. Take this tea and drink it and go to sleep. - You were talking to yourself again, I heard you in the kitchen. - [Christie] I don't talk to myself. - Where's my orange juice? You forgot my orange juice. - The fact that I didn't forget anything. - [Paul] Get my orange juice. (eerie whooshing) - [Christie] It's always something or other.
