- Hello, America. As you probably already know, a deadly virus was unleashed onto the United States last week, and it was successfully quarantined until tonight. Within the next 72 hours, every man, woman and child will either be dead or infected. Why, you ask? You pathetic little people live your mundane lives. You wake up in the morning and you drink your coffee and you go to work, but what you fail to realize is that you are nothing but ants in a farm, and ants don't matter, because all it takes is one little parasite for your entire colony to fall. It's time to wake up. Pay attention! We are the new threat! We're the ones that are responsible for the plague that the city deserves. We are The Reaper. - Hey, you good? - Yeah. - What happened? - Shit was crazy. - You turn into one just like that, look. - Tell 'em. - Hello, America. - I need to get out of here. - Where the hell are you going? Where the hell are you going? - This isn't what we planned. I thought we were raising it to. - Plans change, man, we woke up. - Are you fucking kidding me? - Are you kidding? Sit down! - Fuck this shit, let's just go, come on. - Ah ah, go. - Sit down, get on. - Get on with it, get on with it. What the fuck are you gonna cut me? - Yeah, I'm gonna cut you bitch. - Sit down! - Are you kidding me? - Sit down! - What are you gonna do? What are you gonna do? - I'm sick of you. - What the fuck? - Get outta here. - Get the fuck off him! Come on get off him! Get that fucking gun out of our face. - Down! - We did it baby. Baby. - Wait, what's going on, dude. You've got blood in your mouth, idiots! Stop, this ain't funny! - They have the goddamn virus! - Grab the goddamn gun, come on. - Okay, this thing on? Cool, alright. Hi, mom and dad. - Hey, Jan. - And we just wanted to thank you, finally did it. We got our new car. - We got it. - We just got home from the dealership. We finally did it and now, you can ride in it when you come out to visit us. Which we're very excited about, right? - Hell, yeah. - Right, right. - I'm really excited. Its gonna be good to see you guys. - No, its gonna be great. So I just want to share that with you and I hope you all are doing okay. - Yo, Lauren. Look at this fucking bitch. - What? Don't say that. - This is not a drill. I repeat. - What is she doing? - She fucking drunk or some shit? - Instructions are given. FDA has declared an outbreak. - She's fucking bare feet. - This is a national... - Bro, is this thing on? - Yeah, yeah. If you got the light right there. - Where? - Right there. - Oh so this means its on. - What the fuck else would it mean? I didn't do anything. - No he's right. Like its the first time I've ever used a camera. - You're good man, you're good. - Aright. Sorry, I'm just like. I'm just really nervous you guys. - Do you want me to hold it for you? - Yeah, if you don't mind. Do you mind? - Of course, man. - Alright. - Dude, you got this. - I got this, alright. Julia, alright. This is harder than it looks. Alright, guys. Julia, I've been wanting to make this video for you so we could always remember how special this night was. You're gonna be home soon and well when you walk through those doors, I'm gonna ask you to marry me. I love you so much, honey and I just want us both to be able to remember this night forever, cause this is the first night. I mean this is the night where, the start of our family together. The last three years with you have been well they've been perfect and I want to continue that perfection for the rest of our lives and to help us celebrate, I've invited our best friends, Eisley and Cameron. Say hi, guys. - Hey. - So we're here to make your night absolutely special and I want it to be magical and perfect cause you're perfect to me. Well we've been preparing a bunch of stuff for you. - Did she get off work already? - I don't know. We should of had at least 15 to 20 minutes to prepare. - Doesn't matter. Let me just turn off the stove cause I don't want to miss this. - Yeah, let's do this. - So excited. - You got the camera? - Dude, you got this. - Thank you so much, you guys, seriously, like I couldn't of done this without you. Thanks. - Alright. - Alright, let's do it. - This is it. Let's hope I don't mess it up or something. Hi, honey. You okay? Well, I'm just so glad you're here early cause there's something really important I want to ask you and. You know what, I'm just so nervous, I'm going for it. - Did you hear that? - What's going on outside? - I don't know. - It sounds like its coming from down the street. - What are you doing? - Oh fuck. Oh shit. - Oh, thank god. Hey, is everything okay? What's it like there? Are you okay? - What? Yeah, I'm okay. Wait, wait. Slow down, what the hell's going on? - I don't know. Nobody knows. The National Guard is rolling through the streets. Its fucking crazy. - Goddamn rioters. Do you know what part of town they're in? Are they near you? - Honey, its not rioting. Do you not know what's going on? - I'm in a jungle in the middle of Myanmar and my internet connection is out of my MiFi which is spotty at best. So you tell me. - Some sort of outbreak. They have us on 24 mandatory curfew. People are locked up in their houses, its martial law. - What? Wait, outbreak, what? - Yeah, its like. Some disease, I don't know. Its like rabies. People are acting crazy. The TV is just the emergency broadcast system telling everyone to stay inside. - What the fuck? Wait, are you okay? Did they say how long that you have to stay inside? - I am fine. I don't know how long. I've got plenty of food for a few days. I'll be fine. - A few days? That is crazy. Where is the CDC where is. - I don't, I don't know. I don't know. I'm getting all of my information from shit that people are uploading online. That's all... The networks come back. I... Send you links if you want and so we can figure this. Honey? Oh shit. Stephanie. - They just went downstairs. I don't have that much time. You're not, you're not answering your phone. I can't send this to you. I'm just gonna record this and hope that somebody gets it. We need to figure out what's going on. If we're gonna have any chance. I saw students, they infected within three minutes. Three minutes is all there is and I can't explain how that can happen but look, okay. So the problem is a bite, right? All of a sudden changes brain chemistry. I refuse to believe that these are dead, you know they fall down, but I don't think we're talking about reanimated corpses, that doesn't make any sense. What we're talking about it seems like a diseases, it changes behavior in really horrible ways. Quickly, within three minutes, three minutes. We don't have an answer for that but here has to be the mechanism for blood to change the brain. How does that work? We got the blood brain barrier, right? We also have the blood and cerebral spinal fluid barrier. Two different places. We have endothelioid cells that make it so the things don't penetrate the brain and here the chorolplexus, we have a variety of ways in which the fluids are separated. So what do we do with those elements? How do we talk about diseases that change, we're talking about blood and brain. We have to make sure that something can go through the bloodstream and end up in the... Did you hear that? I have to go faster. Something has to be able to cross this barrier. So we have, you know, non-communicable diseases but what matters are communicable diseases. The things that we know that do this a lot. Things like Parkinson, things like Alzheimer's, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis. Things that have various interactions in these things. It can't be that everybody has a secret form of multiple sclerosis, that's engaged in three minutes by a bite, that doesn't make any sense or any of those kind of things. So we're talking communicable diseases that can pass across these barriers and there's a variety. One is an abcess, right of course, if I get a tooth swelling and it, but that takes too long for an infection to spread, we're talking weeks. HIV based encyopyelitis is something else but that's something where, interesting, the HIV it puts these sort of mono phages up there and they activate at a certain time when the immune system is suppressed. So that's useful. So remember this. This idea. So when we're talking about the HIV, its not HIV but the mechanism is that it sort of hides almost like this Trojan horse, right that's the phrase in the brain activates later. That's the only explanation for how that could happen so quickly. Is something is in the brain already that becomes activated quickly from the time it takes from the blood to cross the barrier in there and activate and it changes something really quickly. So what else are we talking about? We're talking about meningitis. Meningitis, of course it takes too long. Its not something that rabies, which doesn't work, again, too long as well. So what do we... We have to find something that explains how this works. I usually thought of, trypanosomiasis, right? Sleeping sickness, which makes sense because it causes sort of sleep and behavior changes and all kinds of things. Explain some of this violence and things like that. Much better than something like rabies which doesn't work in terms of humans. - Right, look at today, okay? I have known people make thousands of pounds just doing this shit. - I can't do this. - What do you mean you can't do it now? You're committed, love. - I don't think I can do this, Mark. Isn't there any easier way to make money? - You told me that you wanted to make quick and easy money that would be in your bank account tonight and besides which, you said that you weren't doing this for yourself but you're doing it for your boy. - Yeah, of course. - Right. Then we're ready to go. When I cue, to feck. Just put on a show and make ourselves some fucking money! You type on there. You tip, I stream. right, listen up here. Mikey99 has just left a big big tip. Come on. Jay? Oh fuck me, fuck me, fuck me. He's dead. Fuck off, fuck. Jesus. Get out of the fucking way. - Help me! - Can't get to the fucking car keys. - You left me. - So? I need to get out of here, okay. Car keys, have you got em? Great. The fucking thing still on. Fuck. Fucking cunt! Oh fuck. - Enjoy the show, fuckers. - Don't fucking leave me. - I'm a woman, I'm not allowed to think. - No! - Oh hey guys. Chauncey Phillips here. I thought I would do a video checking in with you guys you know as you know, there are things have pretty much gone to shit out there. You know, I'm sure you're all dealing with it as well. I mean, as far as I know, its everywhere. Is a zombie outbreak going on. You know me, I've always been a horror fan and I even talked in the past, like I wonder what it would be like and where I would go if a zombie outbreak happened or things like that and well, I pretty much decided just to lock myself in the DVD room. You know it has a really pretty good strong door. You know most people don't even know its in here. Its hidden away. Its not like something that people are gonna go. People are gonna break into this house, they're not gonna think to come into this room. This is a pretty secret private place and I figured this is a good place to hide myself away. You know I've taken out some water, I've taken some crackers and things like that with me but I got some, I got enough stuff. You don't know how long I'm gonna be in here and I'm not really expecting, you know in Zombie outbreaks, people don't usually live too long and I mean I don't know if I'm gonna be in here for a long time. I don't know if anything, you know, another day someone's gonna bust down this door and come out here and eat me. I have no idea but you know, I don't even really know why I'm bothering to do these videos or why I'm even bothering to update you on this because I know you're all stuck in this situation, as far as I know. But I figured, this is what I do. I'm a video blogger, I do these kind videos, I do this kind of stuff. So why not be one of the few people out there, you know, who knows how many other people are doing this but be one of the people out here who's talking about it and you know, giving you guys updates. Every so often as I get time, I'm gonna give you updates on what's going on, although I'm pretty much just stuck in here and not really doing much but you know, like I said. You know, its zombie outbreak and I'm actually experiencing it and I'm in my DVD room. So at least if I do die, I'm around the things that I love, the things that I like so its not gonna be that terrible. I do wish there was somebody else in here with me, preferably a woman or something but you know, I mean I don't know. But I'll give ya updates. Let you guys know how I'm doing. Hope some of you guys out there are still alive and you know hopefully some of you guys are able to watch this. So I'll see you guys later. Bye. - My name is Mark Stevens. I'm... Gonna die. Some day, I guess. But I... I want to tell you the facts that I know. Fact number one. Laura's not okay. She got scratched three days ago and since then, she hasn't stopped moaning until this very moment. She's been quiet for about 30 minutes. Its the first time she's been quiet in three days. I'm sitting outside her room. I tied her to the bed. - Really, Jimmy with that cellphone? Come on, I'm feeling fat. - Oh you're not fat. You look beautiful. - I'm a balloon. - You are a beautiful balloon with my beautiful balloon baby. Yes you are. - Really? I complain to you that I'm feeling fat and you put the camera on my belly? Really? - Come on. Stop being so insecure. - What was that? - I don't um. I don't know. okay, lets um. Let's. Yeah, let's get out of here. - What was that? - Alright, so all hell broke loose.

Tommy Jam Boy. - Tommy Jam Boy, yes. It would of been better, Tommy, if I say it cause I'm on camera, just remember that. We are sitting in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. Its finally happened and no one is more prepared than us. Is that right, Tommy? - That's right. We got everything we need. - Most importantly, what's this? - A script. - That's right, we got a script. Second importantly, we got one of these. - Camera. - I'm kidding, we've got two of these. - Boom. - Production value. What else we got? We got the zombies. - Holy shit. This is dangerous. - That has been happening. - Okay, so. Yeah okay. - That has been happening for the past three days. You know what we're gonna have to do, right? - What are we gonna have to do? - We're gonna have to shoot a movie. We're gonna have to shoot a motherfucking masterpiece. God damn it, god damn it. Just get her. Now where's the clapper? Where's the clapper? - Bottom of this. Where'd you put the slammer? Is it up there? - I got it, I got it. Okay, I'm just gonna say my line. - Okay. - and jump out and shoot her in the face. - Where's the gun? Why didn't you bring, did you bring the gun? Is it up there? - No, its outside. Its in the kitchen. Its in the kitchen. Can you go get it? - Yes, I'll go get it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Tommy. Okay so I'm just gonna, I'll shoot her in the face. - Be careful with that. Its loaded. - I'm just gonna shoot her in the face. - No, no. You're gonna throw the bullet at her? You don't have to do that with your hand. - I shot a gun before. - You used a gun before? - Yeah I have. - Have you used a gun before? - You know what, don't be a dick. Alright, I'm gonna do this. - Okay, do this line right there. - Ready? - do the slammer. - One. - Wait, hold on. I got to get, okay good. - Okay, so Z-volution, take one. - That's a great name. Yeah, its good. - Ready? - Ready. - God, they're coming from the floorboards. - Okay, so that's shitty. Right? That's really shitty. - She was supposed to pop out. - She was like. Why didn't we get a zombie that, I don't know. Can fucking do something? - Do I look like someone who can tackle a body builder? You idiot. - They're zombies though. - Lets just do this one I'll shoot her in the face. - Okay. - Alright, Z-Cam is live. - Z cam, like zombie cam? - Yeah, like zombie cam. That's my thing. - That's a really good idea. I thank you, sir. But maybe we should shoot her in the face. So I'm not holding a goddamn zombie anymore. - Maybe now is the time for me to discuss like being on screen every once in awhile. - You want to hold this thing? Shoot the goddamn zombie. - Okay, I'll shoot her. God damn it! That was. That was pretty cool. - You could shoot the next one. You want to shoot the next one? You want the gun? I'll take the pole. I just shot a zombie in the fucking head. - TMZ! - I killed you. Yeah! Let's get that guy in the motherfucking onesies. Pull up real slow, I want to get a good shot at this one. - Alright, alright. - Three, two, one. Jam Boy. - Boom! Fuck that dude. - yeah! - Oh that shit was awesome. - What I'm talking about. - What was that? - Jesus Christ! - Fucking A. - Oh shit. - Damn it. - Let's go get her. Let's get in nice and tight. - Oh shit yeah. Look at that. Look that, that. Oh shit, he's still alive. Don't let him get it. Richie, you think this ones right for the attic scene? - I don't know, man. We kind of broke this one. - Oh wait, Richie. Check that out. Oh she's even better. Super suspenseful because its a really tense moment for me. Hey, Richie. This camera down here we got, I got it set up. Its gonna look great. Richie? Oh fuck. not funny. - Its kind of funny. - This bitch is fucking crazy. - Yeah. - Hot. This bitch is fucking crazy hot. - I mean if you're into that kind of stuff. - I guess I am. - She's our lead. So she's gonna come at you. - Yeah, what? What do you mean she's gonna come at me? - She's gonna come at you. I'm gonna save the day, okay? You got a mattress down there, just in case you fall. If anything happens, you got the gun. - Okay. _ Okay. You can trust me on that. If anything goes weird, I will kill her immediately. - okay, I trust you. I trust you, Richie. - If you want, I can kill her right now. We'll start over from scratch. Well get another one. - No, no. No, no we'll just. She's just kind of lively. Okay. Okay. - Now slate. - Okay. - You got this, bro. - This is gonna be epic, jam boy. - Action. Oh shit, shit shit. God damn it. Oh no! Fuck no. God damn it, no. Shit. Tommy! oh god damn it. Jesus Christ. Tommy, Tommy. Tommy, don't fucking turn, man. Don't you dare fucking turn. I can't believe this. I can't believe I fucking got the shot. That's fucking. That's fucking awesome. Fucking nailed that shit. - Well, been in here now a couple days. This is not really that exciting to be in here. You know, uh. You know, of course there's no cable. I mean, I've got lots of things to watch. I mean, okay, I have lots of things to watch. Luckily I'm in here. The power's working. You know, in a lot of these kind of things when its like a zombie outbreak and things like that happen, the powers go, all this kind of stuff. But I'm lucky. You know I mean, for some reason, things are working here and I figure, I'll just put up with this. But I've been hearing things outside. I've been hearing, you know I was able to originally go outside this door and get a few things and I would quickly come back but I've been hearing things out there. So now I'm pretty much stuck in this fucking room. I can't leave this room anymore and I only have so much food in here. I just have a little bit of water and some crack, I have nothing. I hardly have anything. So now I'm stuck in here. Can't leave this room cause I'm pretty goddamn sure there's a fucking zombie right outside this door. So I am stuck in here now and I don't know what I'm gonna do. You know, like I said. This was fun at first, in a weird way, in a weird sense of, you know you always have this idea. I said before about, if you were in a zombie movie, what would you do, where would you go, what would happen? But now that I'm in it and fucking experience it, its not really that fun and like I said, I'm in here all by my fucking self. I've been here by myself for fucking days and I'm so goddamn sick and tired of being in here. You know, I know I can watch the things I want, I know that I can do all the kind of things I want but its getting tiresome and I just need to get out of here and I need to be able to have something else to eat. You know I've been trying to lose weight and I've been losing weight in here but not in the sense that I want to because I'm losing weight for what? I'm gonna fucking die. So what does it even matter anymore? I could be as fat as a house now and it wouldn't make any difference because I'm not gonna, if I leave this room, the zombies don't fucking leave. They're gonna go out there and just fucking eat me. Well I'll give you guys another update in awhile or something. Hopefully some of you guys out there are alright and you know thanks for continuing to watch. Alright. - Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. I can't do this. I can't do this. - Okay, just relax and breathe. Just focus on your breathing. - Are you fucking kidding me with that cellphone? - Okay, alright look, I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it. Okay, okay. Its just, this is important to me, though, right? Like this is our baby and its our moment and if we survive it. - I can't do this without you or I might die. That important enough for you? - Its fucking freezing in here. Its fucking freezing. Its fucking freezing in here. Its fucking freezing. Its fucking freezing in here. Its fucking freezing. Its fucking freezing in here. It fucking stinks. It fucking stinks in here. - Okay, this is a record that we're making. You sure-- - Is it on? - Its on. You sure you want to do this? - Yeah, yeah no I'm sure. - You don't have to do-- - We have to do this. - Alright, alright, okay. Let's, let's at least do it right. What's your name? - My names Joanne Miller. - And do you know where you are? - I'm in my kitchen. - What city? - Los Angeles. - And what year is it? - 2015. - Who's the president? - Barack Obama. - Okay, good, good. You're in good shape. How are you feeling? - Just a little bit of pain where I was bitten. - Do you remember who bit you? You know what, you don't have to answer that if its too painful. - Jeffery. I didn't shoot him in time, I couldn't do it. I couldn't do it. And I knew it. - I understand. I understand. I understand. - Do you understand that you have to shoot me when the times come? Do you know you have to do it? - I don't know if I can do it-- - You have to fucking do it! - I don't know if I can. - You have to shoot me! You take that fucking shotgun and you shoot me when the time comes. You know you have to do it. - Alright, we don't have to worry about that now. I mean, how do you feel right now? - I feel, uh. I feel, I feel sick. I. - Joanne, Jesus. Joanne, how do you feel? - I feel, I feel, I feel a little strange. - Stay with me, stay with me. - I feel. I feel strange.

Joanne? - My mind is breaking. My mind, I can't make thinks like before. I mind is beginning break. Its not think. - Alright, alright, its not important. - I'm fading, I'm fading. - Okay, just hold on, just hold on. Stay with me, stay with me. - Yes, yes. - Yes. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Does that hurt? - Yeah, not so much. Its, it doesn't hurt as much. Shoot me. - I can't. I can't do it. - Shoot me! - I can't do it Joanne. - You have to do it. - You're still here with me. - Who, who are you? - I'm Donald, I'm your husband. I'm Jeffery's father. Joanne. Joanne, I can't do it. I can't do it. I love, I love you. - I love.... - Oh god. - Haven't slept in three days. My wife Laura hasn't eaten in five days. She hasn't had any water in five days, either. And while I know that I'm gonna die or get infected that doesn't mean that I can't have some fun because look look what I've got. I wish that that was tequila. Because I drank all the tequila three days ago and I know that I'm gonna die in this place. - Okay things are coming back. I can't do this quickly. Okay so its not sleeping sickness but what, what do we know about sleeping sickness is its protozoa, really super primitive form of life, protozoa. You can't even see. Protozoa. That's what causes, what are the protozoa, what diseases. We need to be able to find what's connecting these together cause it can explain how this work because because because. Something like toxoplasmosis from cats, that's a protozoa disease and you could have people who have this and don't display symptoms for awhile but its also connected with schizophrenia which is amazing, right, because we're talking about, again, now protozoa that is somehow, you know, in the brain and its sort of a slow sort of issue. Something that go a little faster. You know you got that amoebic disease where it eats away and moves through. So there are other different kinds of protozoa issues. But trypanosomiasis, no, no. Gosh what's the name of it? Its in my notes. I've never studied it before. trichomoniasis, which is different. This is a sexually transmitted disease that is, or obviously we know how that spreads but this is not what we're talking about, people biting each other. But but but, this disease, very specifically, can gestate and men, particularly, can have this for years without spreading it or sharing any symptoms. They have this protozoa disease lodged right there and it doesn't happen. So what we're talking about here is perhaps, perhaps some sort of protozoa, we don't know what it is, that is widely infected, who knows how it got there but people have it, everyone who gets bite, people already have it. The most universal exposure to this thing is protozoa living in the brain. Pass through the brain blood barrier years ago and its lodged in the brain and in these varying, the centers you know aggression and things like this. What would happen now, what would happen now, if you got bit, what would have to happen to your blood in order to activate the protozoa. Its not that you get infected, that's the thing is this bite is not an infectious bite. The bite, its gotta be a protein or a toxin or something else that's transmitted through the saliva that when it hits the blood stream, it activates those protozoa in ways that they weren't active before. You know maybe somehow somehow they're in the brain and they've linked up to sections to cells already and created this sort of complex. This happens in other sort of infections and that complex sits there, sits there and sits there and waits and when the toxin works, it changes. It changes quickly. It changes immediately and, and all of this happens. I wouldn't believe it either, but I saw it happen right there, three minutes. Look, I have to go. I can't do this anymore. Somebody's gonna have to get this and figure it out for me. They're coming back. I think I can get out of the building. I think I can get out but, I um. Sorry. - Jesus, where were you? Is that blood on your shirt? - I had to go on a food run. - You told me you already had food. - That was a couple weeks ago. - Babe, babe what is on your shirt? - I needed food, Stephanie. Why is it so dark there? What happened? - Oh the generator is unreliable so the lights are flaky but answer me, what is that on your shirt? - Blood. - Is it yours? Oh my god, did one of them bite you? Did you get bit? - Nothing bit me, I'm fine. - Alright, well babe. What the hell happened? - You know Rakeem the kid from next door? - Yeah? - He's always skateboarding and wearing a batman shirt. He was in a supermarket. - I'm so sorry you had to do that. I can't even imagine but you know what, he was already dead, okay? It wasn't Rakeem anymore. - He had this, this big knife with him. He must of got from the butcher. So hungry. I haven't eaten in days. - I know, I know. No one is gonna blame you. - I shot him. Over and over. - Wait. Wait, wait, wait. You said he was holding a knife. How could he have been holding a knife if he had already been turned into a? - I have to be here for you. Stephanie, I have to stay alive, Stephanie for when you come home. I need you to come home, Stephanie. I need you. - Babe, babe, no. - Hey, I'm your daddy and um, this is what I looked like the day you were born. Oh and this is your mommy and that's you. You don't even have a name yet. Its weird, right? the truth is its kind of a crazy time right now, when you were born. There's, well there's bad things out there and so your mommy and I are down here hiding and we are keeping you safe, okay? You're safe and that's okay. This right here, this is what I'm proudest of in the whole world, your mommy and you. I'm not always that great at things, been so many bad businesses, bad decisions. bad times. And if I had to do one thing right, one thing, I am so glad that it is you and your mom. - Who are you talking to? - The baby. Yeah. - Oh. - You want to say anything? Jim? - We gotta go, we gotta go. - I can't, I can't. I'm too tired. - No come, we gotta. - I'm so tired. - I know you are. I know how tired you are, please. Shit, they're through, they're through. - I can't. - come on, yes you can. You can do it. You gotta. Shit, come on. - okay. - Oh god. Come on, come on. Oh god. Come on, we gotta move. Come on, you can do this. Come on. Come on, they're so close. Please, come on. Let's get somewhere. They're right behind us. This way. In here, quick. Right this way. - So my boy went across the street to go see maybe, see what was going on. Maybe they had the news going. Try to figure out what's going on. Where we can go or anything like that. He's been gone over an hour and he hasn't come back yet and I just don't know what's, what's. Matt? Matt, is that you? Hey, you better not be fucking with me, bro. This is not a laughing matter, man. I mean, for real, we don't even know if this shit could be related or it could be unrelated. This isn't funny, man. You got your laugh, just call it. Matt! Matt? Oh shit! Oh shit, dude. Oh shit, shit! - I'm just breaking out of jail now. I don't know what these things are. I know they killed my wife. They killed my mom, they killed everybody I know but if I can make it out of this prison alive. I know one thing is true. I am gonna kill everyone last one of these motherfucking zombies. That's my word or I will die trying. - Hey guys. I'm doing what I think is really gonna be the final update. I know I said before, I don't see any hope for me. I have absolutely no water, no food, no nothing left. I can't leave this room. Yes, I know I could go out in the room and then I would be attacked and then I would end up turning into what's happened to everyone else and I don't want that. I don't want to. You know, I've always loved zombie movies and all that kind of stuff but I don't want that. I don't want that to be what happens to me. I would rather stay in this room and die in here then have to you know to have that happen to me. I can't face that reality of that happening and you know, I don't know if, if that happened if I would know, if I would remember myself before or what but I'm, rather stay in this room and totally starve to death than have to have that happen to me and I said, I'm in here I can't watch TV, I can't do anything I've been doing in here. The lights off, absolutely starving with absolutely nothing else to eat. So, this will be my last video. I hope I have enough battery left on this phone to get this uploaded. If not, hopefully somebody finds this phone in years to come. You know you see these videos and just hope everyone doesn't forget me. So thank you everyone who watched and subscribed to me all these years and I'll see you guys later. - Unexplained, as the violence. - Hey man, don't be recording this shit. - Don't trip man, no ones ever gonna see this. - You know this shits evidence, right? - No this dead fool is evidence. You expecting somebody? - Nope. - What are you doing, man? - I'm gonna see what this fool wants. - Fuck man. - Bro, what the hell do you think you're doing? - That fucking crack head bit me, man.

Please help me. - Stupid bitch. You stupid fucking bitch. So, it has been 29 days since this so called outbreak. I was gonna start this video diary yesterday but I thought someone may see me. There have been various reports of this so called infected that since the television stations went down. The ones around here. The ones around here are really fucked up. I mean, for one, they're super intelligent. Well super intelligent for raging lunatics. I mean they hunt in packs and they've got one or two scouts and they go round looking for victims and places to hunt. They set up camp on what was once a beautiful and quiet street. I was on a food run the other day and I saw a group of them. They got this guy that was hiding out in a shed. Stand out is that once they become infected, they have this bloody x starts spreading across their face. I used to watch horror films but man, this was something else. I think that's enough for today. This is Georgia Romero reporting for the World is Fucked News. No one knew I lived here. I was kept in the back room. His precious little secret. I can't help but think that when they took him away, he finally got what he deserved. All those nights of drunken abuse paid back tenfold. Now all I've got to do, keep myself secret and I may just survive this. What a shitty time of year to have the zombie Apocalypse. Fucking Christmas. I'm going to show you how to make the perfect omelet. So, there have been many arguments about choosing duck eggs but personally I prefer chicken. I think they just taste rich. Once the mixture hits the pan, it will have its underlying coat. Now is the prefect time to add a fine mature cheddar. Grated, of course, add this to the mixture and it will start to melt. And there you have it. The prefect omelet. Next week, we do shark fin soup. man. I'm so hungry. Really do need to do a food run. Fuck it. I went on a food run last night and one of the x marked lunatics saw me. I mean I run back as fast I could but they're not fucking slow. On the plus side, I did find his secret stash of alcohol. Not like I can drink it though. I can't. Just can't. I had, I, I really want a cheeseburger. ♪ Its the end of the world as we know it ♪ I knew it was a bad idea. One of the x marked psychos heard me last night and fucking broke in. Grabbed the empty vodka bottle I smashed his head with it until it was muck and he was fucking laughing. What the fuck does that mean? Is it spread by blood? Am I fucking infected? I fucking fought back and that's what kills me? Its not fucking fair. I just wanted to be free. I just wanted to be free. Wanted to be free. Fucking free. I'm fucking free. I'm fucking free. I'm fucking free. I'm fucking free. I'm fucking free. - What the... You see her? Can you. - I wouldn't open that door man. I'm not opening that fucking door. - No. Well that fuckers so slow, we'll just go out there and kill that motherfucker right now. - And his leg's broken. - That's even better. That's why I got a fucking baseball bat. You take out the other fucking leg. - We got to get that truck, man. - Alright. Alright. - Go help Joe. - Hey, where's Joe? - He's back that way somewhere. Oh he's over there. - You found the keys? - They may be in the office. - Alright. Oh a pole. Hey, you ladies want to dance while we're going? Waiting up here? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Alright, cool. - Hey for real. Any girl want to get on the pole? - I know, seriously. - If. - I mean, we're gonna have a whole lot of fun for 30 seconds. Yes, man. I'm putting this shit on YouTube. - Gonna mark the spot where he can park at with the flare. - Alright. - We found a whip. - You found a whip? - We found a whip. - Hell yeah. - Who knew we'd have some. - What you find over there? - Got some drinks. - Drinks, some soda and candy. - Oh candy. - And some popcorn. - Popcorn? Hell yeah. - Yeah not popcorn. - They moving yet? - Man, they still right there. Hopefully we can get that damn thing started. - Oh shit. - Ladies, ladies. Here he comes. - Alright, let's get the last of the supplies and let's go. - Park it, park it, park it. Perfect. Right there. - Come on. - Come on hurry up. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. - We're waiting. - Let's get the fuck in the truck! - Alright, alright come. Oh fuck. Who the fuck? - What the fuck is going on? - What's going on? - Get her, get her, get her. - What happened? - She got bit. - Fuck. - Everybody get in the truck! - Come on, come on. - One, two, three. - Go, go, go. Let's go, let's go. Come on everybody, in. In the truck. - Get in the truck. - Come on. - come on. Fuck. Fucking shit. Fuck. I'm gonna check this shit out. Oh shit. - What the hell man? Come on. Come on. - Fuck, fuck. Fuck. - Let's go, let's go. Something was wrong, let's go. - Come on. - Come on. - We're sealed, we're sealed. Let's go. - I don't want to die alone. Nicki, if you ever see this. I. I was gonna ask you to marry me. I'm sorry. It won't stop bleeding. It won't stop bleeding. I don't want to die here. I'm finding out how to stay awake. The battery's going. Its. Really hard to keep my eyes open. The battery's going on the camera. I didn't think it last this long. Now its just a matter of which one of us will die first. Me or the camera. - This week the world died. The world we know as is gone. Its been stolen from us in a flash. People said its, people say that there is no cure but I believe there will be one in the future. I don't know if the people infected will be back to normal. Who knows. Do I want to live in a world like this. - I'm making this video to clear myself of any legal consequences for what I'm about to do. I don't know what else to do. I can't just leave her here. I. I can't just leave. I have to do it. I have to kill my wife. I have to show you. I'll show you. I'll show you. Laura? I have... I have to do it. Laura, say something. Laura. - Its been about a month. Since this whole thing has started. I was with a group for awhile but they're gone now. I found a cafe. What's left of one, anyway. There's some canned food out the back and a couch to sleep on. If sleep is even possible right now. The food should last me a week, maybe two. After that, I don't know. I guess I'll just keep moving. I don't know what happened. I mean, one day everything was normal and then the next there are these people but they're not people. They're dead. And the ones that are still alive, I mean they want to kill you anyway cause they either want your stuff or they just don't want an extra mouth to feed. I guess its safe to say that humanity is dead. So I might as well be, too. I don't even know if my family is still alive and when I go outside I see these people that I went to school with but they're not people anymore. I hope someone finds this video. Cause if you do, then it means you made it and if you can make it through this, if you can make it through the virus of the dead you'll be okay. - Hi. - Hi. - You okay? - No. But I don't want to talk about it. How's it going there? - A few of the villagers decided to look for a wild pig and some other food in the jungle but they haven't come back yet and then a few more decided to take the into town and we needed fuel for the generator but its really quiet here. - Its been quiet here for days. There are fewer and fewer uploads on whatever's left of the internet. I heard some chatter about... - wait, babe what is that? What is that? Chris, Chris? (airplane flying overheard. - That, my love, is a motherfucking apache helicopter. Yeah, you know what that means? That means that somebody out there still has their shit together. - You think so? - Yes, yes we're gonna pull through this. We are gonna, and you're gonna come home. - I need to come home. I've been so scared. - Hey, babe, who's that behind you? - What's? Oh my god. - Stephanie, run. Run! Stephanie!
