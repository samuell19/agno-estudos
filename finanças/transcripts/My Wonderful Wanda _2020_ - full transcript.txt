MY WONDERFUL WANDA Four hours late. I'm sorry. I was happy to wait. Thank you. Take care. Bye. I was starting to think you wouldn't come. Hello. Hello. - And how was your journey? - It was good. Mephisto? Come in, come. - You aren't too tired, are you? - No. Welcome back! An angel is in my room. Good afternoon, Mr Wegmeister-Gloor. Good afternoon, Wanda. A little present! - Myśliwska! - Yes. Mh, thank you. - Everything alright? - Yes. The other one was a catastrophe. So loud and so rough. Ugh! Should I help? Or do you manage on your own? No. The last time! Good. And now up. Yes. Good. Careful, arm. Very good. And... up. One, two, three! The other one fed me like a baby. "Here comes helicopter, open your mouth, Mr Wegmeister-Gloor." - Really? - Yes. And her hands. Like those of a seventy year old. So that was a good match. Did you go shopping again? Yes. A barn owl. Beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful. But dead. On. Off. Please use it at night and when you have no time. No time? Well, we're in for quite a lot. Not least the guests, 25 people, so... So it would be good if you wouldn't only take care of my husband. Where's Manuela? She went back to Portugal. She won't return. She's going to marry. Nice! Yes, nice, but I've lost my cleaning lady. It's hard to find someone good in a hurry. That's why, um... Let's say an additional 200 for additional work in kitchen and house? 600. 200 for each month. I thought 200 overall. Overall. 9200 for three months. 9600 for three months. I'm just talking of a little housework. Tidying up, doing the dishes, - cleaning. - 500. 9500. For the entire time. - Here. - Thank you. Hair. Hand. Second hand. Tummy. Here. Very good. Legs. Blow out the candles! - Thank you very much, Mum. - What for? For the bike. Come to Grandpa. Wanda! Wanda! Wanda! Wanda. Good morning, my darling. What a beautiful day. She's still going for a swim? Luckily, no? You used to look like that too. You still remember! Congratulations... on your birthday! My dear. Here. Mephisto, you pig! Why aren't you putting this incontinent devil to sleep at last? We're not putting you to sleep either! Do we, Mephisto. My sweety. We're not putting him to sleep either. So many clothes. Why aren't you wearing them? You're a beautiful woman. We had our time. Friends disappear and with them the occasions. Choose one. No! But yes! I want to give it to you as a present. Maybe this one? - The dress I wore for my engagement. - Sorry! No! I'm sure it'll suit you. Thank you. Many thanks. I'll wear it for Mr Wegmeister-Gloor's birthday. It's too good for that. But it's his... - Wanda, some guests don't know that you're working for us. That's why you'd better stay in the kitchen this evening. Okay. Yes. Happy 70th birthday! May all your burdens melt away and may you have a wealth of happiness and health for many years to come. Who sent this? Max and Therese Sieber. - They're still alive? - Yes. This one's from the mayor. Dear Josef, the community...- Yes, go on. Shooting club St. Hubertus? Gymnastics club Olympia? Children's choir St. Martin? You are... a famous man. Nonsense. I'm not famous. Maybe popular, a little. Do you know why, Wanda? Here. You've got to keep people happy. There. Now you are handsome. Handsome and popular. Yes. I used to be a handsome chap. A BMW 5 series? Is that already my daughter? Come on, help me. Yes. They're taking a big box out of the car. Jesus! Yes. That's my coffin. Happy birthday, dearest Dad, Congratulations, Dad. Thank you. Fit above and tight below! Congratulations Josef! Dad, we have a wonderful surprise for you. Yes. Would you like to come with us? That's a drive of four or five hours! Twenty more, Dad, and you're done. But how shall I manage that? Hello? Leave him in peace. You still have plenty of time. Sophie's specially taken a week's holiday. Sophie, I'm terribly sorry, but I have to drive away at once. To Mr Wattenwyl. What? - That's a 3 ½ hours' drive! - What can I do? You know how important this is to me. If you leave now you don't need to come back. Another fifteen. Oh, don't make such a fuss! - Dad! - Wanda. I think he's having a dizzy spell. Rubbish! You're fine, aren't you? Are you tired? Let's get the girl, she should put him to bed. - He's got to be fit after all. - I'll do it myself. Wanda! Mr Wegmeister Gloor, what happened? We exercised a little and now he's a bit tired. He wants to go to his room and I'll take him there. Up! - Wait, I'll help. - We need the wheelchair. Careful. Gregor. - Careful. - Bring the wheelchair. Wanda! Where is she? - Careful! - Careful with the leg. Three, two, one and up! But... No! Careful! It's been proven that vitality is sustained if people who are handicapped... He isn't handicapped! He had a stroke. Don't leave me to those lunatics. It's important to maintain self-responsibility... They're not crazy. as long as possible. - They're family. - That's quite clear! It's a proof of love. In Poland maybe. Here too. It's the same. Everywhere. Why has Manfred already left? Because we quarrelled? That wouldn't upset him anymore. Here. He had to urgently meet a client. Yes, thank you. So urgently he's not likely to make it back today. For Josef's party? Now look at that! Gregi's taking off the washing? You don't say. I think your brother's fallen in love. With the carer? Well, she's pretty and young. And I'm happy she's back. Yes, okay, but... - How she's flinging herself at him! - Even your father likes her. Wanda! - Let me do this. - Wanda! There. - Where's Wanda? - She can't come right now. What do you mean, she can't come? Because she's occupied. - She should occupy herself with me. - Yes. But she's looking after your son right now. She should look after me! Not after Gregor. Yes. See, here's the delicious food. Yes. It's good, isn't it? Wanda's here for me. For me. - She's here for me. - Yes. Yes! For me! Wanda, Wanda, Wanda. - Hello! - Mum! How's it going? - Okay. - Mum! I've made the ninth mark on the wall today. When are you coming home, Mum? - Soon. - Tomorrow? Another 81 marks. Then you may wish for anything you like. Okay? Enough. Move off! I need the computer. But I have a right to work. Dad, why are you so strict? If you don't like it, come home to raise them. It okay for me this way. I just wanted... Computer was on. I wanted to see the children, large. I thought... I'm sorry. So am I. Josef had a dizzy spell. But he's sleeping now. How nice that he can lie in his own bed. How you are looking after him. Kudos to you! Thank you. And what did you study? I have a degree in medicine and also in economics. Ah, that's useful in your area of expertise. Yes, I can really use this. Yes, absolutely. I am happy that you are all here. Nice to see you. Josef's prepared a little speech. Now you'll hear it from me. Dear guests, dear children, dear Elsa, I'm happy you're here to celebrate with us. My birthday: That's the least important reason, so that's done. Thank you. Oh, that Josef. More important to me is to drink to the firm again. Our son Gregor, who successfully completed his engineering degree that is also a cause for celebration is from now on officially the new director of Gloor Building Materials AG. Bravo! I'm proud that what we've built is prospering and growing and as of today will continue to live through Gregor. Thank you. So let's raise our glasses not to the past but to the glorious future! The buffet will soon open. - Will you take care of it? - You can go on playing. What's happened? Gregor? Have you lost it? Letting mum down in front of everyone? After dad's already disgraced her. Dad had a dizzy spell. He didn't have any dizzy spell, never in his life! He just didn't feel like it. -Okay. -Neither do I. You're such a baby! Where's the béchamel sauce, didn't they bring it? -Yes. -Why isn't the cake in the fridge? I wanted to put candles... We don't need any. Nobody there to blow them out! If you want to stay dad's favourite you should take over the firm after all. You could have said no. I'll do this. You're not the victim of the family. You're the victim of your indolence. You're always exaggerating... Without our mum you'd starve in bed. They serve you everything on a silver platter. Failed his exams twice, our director! The third chance they bought for you. Success looks different. Like you? I've got such a super offer in fucking New York! You can only dream of that! Super, super, super Sophie! At least I'm doing something with my life! And you? You're like all your stiffened staring birds! You're such a frustrated biddy! No. I'm not frustrated. I live the way I want. What did it bring you? You exerted yourself. And in the end nobody noticed. Not even your husband who's just leaving you. Will you please leave Manfred out of this? Where is he today anyway? You're my brother and such an idiot! Don't you quarrel in Poland? Left. - Right. - Left. That's... That's not Titanic, I hope. This boat weathers any storm. It's my parent's wedding present. Ah... Jo... Jose... Joselsa. In spring I row out every morning and wait for the tit. Nice. Did you know the sun rises when the tit sings? You can set your watch by it. It's called bird clock. Bird clock. - Is that your invention? - No! The song thrush wakes up 55 minutes before sunrise. The cuckoo 50. The sparrow 30. The chiffchaff 15. The greenfinch 10 minutes. You're good with birds. But not now. Not? No. No. Now it doesn't call. The tit. - Are you deaf or what? - Wanda! No. I forgot. Wanda! Sorry. Wanda! Did Gregi give you this? No. But that's not... May I? Wanda! - You've stolen this! - No, I haven't! Give me your passport. What? Now! Wanda! Mum! Greg! - My goodness! - Wanda! You'd know if something's missing or not. My God! You're making me quite... I know it exactly but we've had so many expenses... Tell me her salary and I can say what's missing. What's the matter? Our Pole stores this money in her mattress. Do you have any idea where she's got it from? It seems you don't either. Wanda, say something. - I've got it... - Yes? Wanda! Doesn't anyone hear me in this damn house? From Mr Wegmeister-Gloor. - Dad. - Did you give her this money? Or is Wanda lying? - Dad. - Say something! Dad! She says you've given it to her. Josef! - Tell us. - Three thousand francs? - My money? - What for? For the cow. What? What cow? The milk cow. Is he completely bonkers now? - Wanda's parents are dairy farmers. - Yes. They would like to have a good cow. For their enterprise. Yes. I want to give them something that is valuable and stays. And when I'm not there they have something nice from me. And because I know how important a good cow is for a small enterprise I lent her the money. I'm old, I know. But I'm not senile. And I may still decide myself where I want to invest a little seed capital. Or may I not do anything I want anymore? Sophie! I think you should apologise. But you all also thought that she... Sophie! Yes. I'm sorry. Really. - I apologise. - It was a stupid misunderstanding. - I didn't believe it anyway. - Just go, all of you! I'll soon wet myself. May I? My wonderful Wanda. I'm leaving. But everything's alright again! Wanda... Here. Take it. Take this. Take it. And there's more of it. But stay. Please! I'll leave. And I'll never come back. Never again. Bye! Good that you're here. Jesus... Has he died? Yes. Yesterday. He didn't want to feed anymore, just sleep. Oh. Little devil. He's in heaven now. How's your husband? Oh well, up and down. - Can he walk? - No. Shall I stop? Must have been the long journey. Didn't you want to go to the firm today? You are happy too that she's back. But Gregi... She's here because of the mon... My God. My God! Josef? Josef! Josef! Elsa! It's a miracle. I can't believe it. It's a miracle. Oh, dear Josef. Elsa. -Elsa. -I don't believe it! Elsa! I'm going to be a father! I'm going to be a father! Elsa! Help! Elsa! Wanda! Wanda! What did you do to her? Ouch! Get Wanda! What did you do? I didn't force her to do anything! She's having my child. Get Wanda. Mum! Mum, that Pole only wants our money. A classic case of legacy hunting. Mum, please open. It's impossible anyway. Dad's infertile. No. No, he isn't. But you always told us that due to his stress and his smoking there was no third child. After Gregi's birth... I could no longer have any children and your father thought it was due to him and I let him believe it. But why did you... Why did you do that? Because I... Because I was ashamed. Manfred needs to come. Wanda's pregnant from dad. - What? - Wanda's pregnant from dad. I thought he could only produce warm air now! I don't know what's so funny. Manfred, you have to come here at once, please. Thank you. It was ordered. We're on the 8th floor. What should I do with a cow? Should I take it into my bathroom? - A live cow! - Mother of God! Take care, you'll get dirty. Take the cow back with you! I didn't order any cow. - Here's your name: Kowalski. - Let me see! Jakub made this painting for you. It's... Cow. Mathilda. It was a big surprise at home when the car came with a cow. You're very crazy. I'm an idiot. I... I thought... Then you can keep your money, buy something nice for yourself... Gregor. I slept with your father for money. - A couple of times, not more. - Like a... Like what? I did that for my children. For my children! You know all that. Wanda? Listen. Despite everything that's happened and even if I... don't quite understand it and even if you are a whore, I... I still want you. Thank you. Thank you for the cow. Birdman. - You have to speak with mum. - She doesn't want to. - Then you have to try harder! - I did. You can tell your mum I'll acknowledge the child. I want the child. It's my child. You can't understand that, can you? You are also my child. It's my child. My child. My child. His child, his child, his child. Please forgive me, I didn't want this. But you once told me that he can no longer have any children. But unfortunately that was wrong. I did not want this but if it's God's will, so be it. Two children without a husband is hard, three children impossible. That's why I need 100 000. Please forgive me. Wanda. What did I tell you? The Pole only wants money. If Josef's really the father, there's a third heir. Yes. Gregi, a third of all this here. Of the goods acquired after marriage, only of that. There's the marriage contract. The house and the firm belong to Elsa. Still, it's better to offer her 150 000 to abort. - Wanda's catholic. - So are we. The child must vanish. No child, no blackmail. Manfred's right, unfortunately. It's money well invested. Money, money, that's all you're talking about! But it's about our family! Our reputation! The Wegmeister-Gloors aren't just anybody, we have a reputation to uphold! I just wonder what her family's saying to all this. It's probably the same there as here: They're lying and cheating like anything. - In my house... - What? Truth can't be spoken? You don't even notice anymore when you're lying yourself. Mum! Greg! Please sit down. Are you alright? Has wilful intent crossed your mind? Through false pretenses the person could provoke an error with the intention of damaging your mum's fortune. What error? Deceit, Gregi. Deceit. Josef's paternity needs to be ascertained. But first of all, whether the person's pregnant at all. - Seriously? - Yes. Did you go to the doctor's? Which week? What? Fourteen. Piss off! It's none of your business! It's quite simple. No, it's not so simple. - And? - Josef, we've got to sort this out. Piss off! - But do listen to me. - Piss off! Have I ever asked you if you're fucking my daughter? No. Josef, we need to ascertain... Is the sperm clogging your ears? I don't need any paternity test! I am the father! We are keeping the child! We won't have our child aborted! I'll get a divorce and marry Wanda. - Wanda! - Josef... Do you want to marry me? Mum! Mum! That won't help. Life's strange, isn't it? On the drive here I thought the Pole was pregnant and that you... the father... And now I'd give anything for it to be so. Do you want me to assume the paternity? You? No. Although, then... I'd be a grandma at last. Or even better, I adopt the child and be a mother again. Oh, Greg. It's all about money. I'm being blackmailed. If she's the mother of his child, no money on earth will change that. Oh, a lot of money will. You know that. My dear boy. Mum. Wanda, darling, we've talked it all over already. I can't wait, Mum. - Everyone's going crazy here. - Should we tell your father? The truth? - Dear God! - Hi Mum! When are you coming back? Hello. Wave to your mum. Move over. Hello, Jakub. Asparagus are on offer. - When are you coming home? - What truth? Mum! Mum! I'm pregnant. - What? You mean you're getting a baby? - Pawel, better a child from there than from Poland. Who impregnated you? - Dad, can we discuss this later? - Mum, what's impregnated? Your mother's getting a baby! - Pawel, stop it, let him go! - What? Why should I let him go? Should I raise a third brat now? Stop it! Let him go! Mum, does that mean you have a new family now? Like our father? No. Want to see the Polish baby? Doesn't interest you. Sophie, please, we've talked it over umpteen times. Yes, I know, chapter closed. Yes. - It's simply not supposed to happen. - Exactly. But it's also fine the way it is. There's so much we still want to do. What exactly? Oh, shit! Everything's shit! Forgive me. No. It's not Wanda's fault. I gave her money for it. It was a business transaction. And that's supposed to make it better, does it? I think so. But now there's a child. That changes everything. Darling. By the time the child asks for me, I'll be dead. Yes. You think death's an excuse for everything? You've never loved me. You're the mother of my children. Oh, what a beautiful declaration of love! Yes! I am getting a divorce. Not you. Oh, Mum! This is your music! Come! Come off it! We'll let our hair down tonight! - You're drunk! - So what? The frustrated biddy can also be quite easy. Easy the Polish way. Sophie. Mum, Mum, Mum... - I lied too. - You? I can't get any children either. My egg cells are too bad. And Manfred no longer wants to help it along. Why are always the others having the children? Children... are no guarantee for our happiness. Okay... - Come, come. - And what should I do now? Not drink so much. I'll get a divorce. Me too. But it won't be worth it anymore! But I'll do it anyway. Mum? You can't... buy yourself everything. I'm not an engineer. And I am not a director either. I need to do what I want. Like dad. The old egomaniac. Egotistical old prick. Do you have to? Dad, listen... Dad, sorry... - I, sorry... - Yes, sorry, Dad... Daddy. Go whistling, Gregor. Life out there's not for you. SILVER WEDDING ANNIVERSARY Let's forget everything. W. Wanda's gone! How, "gone"? Gone like gone. What was that? Even though nothing's been settled? Oh, we're in for something. What's going on? Wanda's gone with all her things. Too bad. Because I had an idea. It's simple and ingenious. A win-win situation for everyone. Hello. I'm so happy you've come. No, let me! - This one, isn't it? - Yes. - The red one. - Yes. I can't wait! God, quite heavy, your suitcases. What on earth's in them? Do you want me with you during the birth? Manfred's settling the last technicalities. Stop, you're sleeping in Gregi's room. - Where's Gregor? - Finally left the nest. We haven't agreed on its name yet. I was thinking of Henriette or Zelda, but Manfred wants Sissi. You know? Like that empress, Elisabeth? But the child would always be compared to Romy Schneider. Would you want that? I wouldn't. Here. - Is it okay like this? - Yes. Good. - What do you think? - Very nice. Look at this. And... where does Gregor live? He wanted to live closer to the firm. He's got a nice big flat, a bit empty but he'll get there. And how is he? Look! Yes, we're all happy that he's entered fully now. I found these! Sweet. Well, you'll want to have a rest. I'll make a raspberry leaf tea for you. Thank you. Excuse me, but may I? Yes! Hello! Hello! - May I? - Yes! Wanda. I'm the father of this child. I'll acknowledge it. And look after it. We have a good solution now. Yes. But I'm the father. I made this child myself. And I'm in great health. I'm as fresh as a daisy. - I know. - Yes! But it's the best. - Yes. But... - Wanda! - Everything healthy? - Yes, thank you. Are you sure it's only one? Yes. We're having mug cake! And champagne. For those who may. The first instalment of 50 000 has been paid to you for the acknowledgement of my paternity. Here's the notarized copy of my acknowledgement of paternity. This dispenses with any claim of inheritance regarding the family Wegmeister-Gloor. By your presence and your willingness to give birth to the child here, another 50 000 are becoming due. Thank you. The last instalment of 100 000 is to be paid once you have officially registered me as the father and the child is staying with us. Have you understood everything? Yes. So please sign here and here, please. - Tea? - Yes, a little. - Mum, you too? Manfred? - Yes. Better no sugar, right? - These strawberries are fantastic. - They're organic. Fantastic. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Have you ever tried strawberries with champagne? No. That's really nice. See? Would you like some? - I don't drink any alcohol... - It's not drinking, it's... You hardly notice anything. These are so ripe... What? What did she say? Something in Polish. Mum! Mum! Hello. What are you doing here? Dad! What are you doing here? I want to speak with the child's father. - Dad, stop it. - Who's the father? - Here! - I am. Hello. You are a criminal. - I beg your pardon? - I'm a solicitor. With us, buying children is a crime. With us, what you are doing is trespassing. Leave our grounds or I have to call the police. Excuse me, this is still my house. Elsa Wegmeister-Gloor. Pawel Kowalski. I'm so happy to meet you! Please come in. Children. Dad, what are you doing? What? I only got this beast through customs by bribing them. We drove the whole night. Jakub threw up all over the car. Your mother's not talking with me anymore. And now I want to know from you what you women have cooked up. - Could you talk German please? - Or English. I talk the way I like. This is a family matter. Champagne? No thanks. Mr Solicitor, what do you have in mind? - I'm giving the child up for adoption. - I'm not consenting to that. You've got no word in this. I'm grown up, Dad! We have a business transaction in mind, so to speak. A few zloty for the Pole and my grandchild belongs to you? It's our child now. And it will have a good life with lots of love and your daughter gets good money. I will really be a good mother to it, I promise. Wanda... I am the father! Dad, please. Not now. Is that true? Did you know this? Look at it this way, Mr Kowalski. What we've agreed upon is the best for all involved. You're crazy. All of you! A win-win situation, so to speak. No! This child belongs with its mother. With my daughter. With our family. To Poland. Mr Kowalski... I won't leave until the baby's here. I'm so afraid they'll take my girl away from me. Even if this sounds stupid. Don't worry, dear. Soon we'll be a family. You'll see. Beautiful. Those who have it, have it. We should've gone to a hotel, but you... They think we're farmers. Send a cow as charity... Think we're stupid. Well, you acted stupidly enough. Stop it! Your daughter thinks practically. The man took her for a ride and now she's making the best of it. The best thing would be an inheritance. But your women's mind... Not much to get there. She has him on a tight rein. Same as with us. Pawel. We're getting 200 000 francs, immediately. You haven't earned this much in your life. You should be grateful to Wanda. Your pride doesn't buy us anything. Wanda! Wanda! What do you want? I forgot my pills. Please. Only for a moment. Five minutes. Do I still exist anymore at all? Yes... What a beautiful animal you are! Yes... Really beautiful girl. Well, Mathilda... Josef... Josef... Josef! - Hello. - Hello. Gregor. I'm sorry. Thank you. Me too. You're... really a boss. Yes. Ho. ho, Mathilda! Ho-o, Mathilda! That's my father. Stop! Stop! Stop! Come here, kids! Come here! Don't go too close to it. Come on. It's going to a farm. My tooth. What do you have here? - My tooth! - Show me! Super! Do you want to sit down? Wanda? Let me pass! Wanda, my darling, lie down. -What? -Call the ambulance! What? Water! Water! Call the ambulance! Lie down. Wanda, lie down. Hello? Yes? We're having a birth here! The third child. Date of birth? Doesn't matter! Seestrasse 184! Seestrasse 184! Wegmeister-Gloor. Yes, it's happening quickly. Breathe! - I can't go on! - Breathe! - I can't do it. - Yes, you can! - It's not working... - Breathe. Please. - Breathe! - It's not possible. Lie down. Lean back. - Breathe! - I can't go on... Breathe! I can't. Wanda. Breathe! Wanda, breathe! Breathe. I can see the head! A head with hair, Wanda! You have such long fingers! Oh, such long fingers. Thank you. Yes. Yes, yes, Mum's coming. There. Okay? She needs to get used to my scent. Dinner's served. And this goes with it. Elsa! Thank you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Thank you. To Dad! Cheers. To the health of mother and child. To the health of mother and child. Exactly. To the happiness of Sophie and Henriette. Cheers. - May I? - Yes. Here's some bigos. You can't have any vodka of course. - How's the baby? - Fine. Your mother says you're doing this to help us. But you know you don't have to do this. Dad, look around. After all... She'll have it good here. I can't raise three children on my own. And I can't ask you for help all the time. Look, you studied, you're educated. Where did it get you? Do you have a job? And does mother have one? Mum helps where she can. I come here and work hard. And still I have no perspectives. None at all. I want my sons to have a better chance than we. We can use the money very well for this. Dad. Wanda? Wanda? Wanda? Wanda! What's going on? No idea. Wanda! - Stay here. - Don't budge! Wanda! Wanda! Where are you going with her? Henriette's our child! We've adopted her! Wanda. That's our baby. - Shush! Sophie, the neighbours... - So what? It's not a secret! Everybody may hear it! Perhaps there's something wrong with the baby. Jakub! Tomasz! Hold tight! Wanda, give me back my child! We paid a lot of money, very much! Sophie, if you go on shouting like this the whole town will know about it. - I don't give a damn! - Wanda, what are you doing? It can't not matter to you if I lose my admission... But she is criminal! Did you do this with your other kids too? Sat on old men and then made them pay? These people want their child. - Do something! - I'm trying. Wanda, what's the matter with you? - Wanda! - Say something! It's the hormones. Wanda! I can't give her to you. I... can't give her. It's enough now. Wanda. What are you saying? Think of Jakub, Tomasz, your mother! Dad... - She's crazy! - I'm always thinking of you. We have to stay calm now. All the time I'm only thinking of you. - I don't want to anymore. - Wanda. - Wanda, my daugther, my darling. - I can't do it anymore. Wanda, my darling. Her name is Anna. Sophie. It's probably better this way. For all of us. Aren't you helping me? Manfred, say something! - Do something! - I can't. Sophie, it's impossible. Josef? Josef! - The children! - Holy shit! Go away. Jakub! Tomasz! The boat's sinking! Sophie! Let her be. - This should go in front, right? - Yes. First from the back... - Like that? This below. - Yes. - Bye, Mum. - Have you got everything? - Please do the driving. - Shall I drive now? Take care. Don't drive too fast. Bye. Take care. Send me a message when you get there. You'll be fine. And come back soon. - Good bye. - Ciao. Elsa? We're leaving. I packed some sandwiches for the children. Good bye. Safe journey. Jakub! Tomasz! What are you doing here? Wanda! Wait! Please, don't go away. There's plenty of room in this house.
