- You know, I spent most of my life, chasing my tail, like everyone else. I probably spent the better part of a few decades at least, grinding it out, putting in the long hours thinking that I needed more, and what I had wasn't enough. Ah, we got so caught up in what we think is important. But I learned as we all do eventually, that there is no amount of material wealth that can replace the time spent for ourselves. You know as you get older your perspective slowly begins to shift. It's actually not unlike climbing a mountain in that way. You hardly notice the change as it's happening, until eventually a bigger picture reveals itself. To have actually lived a life is still something you cannot get any other way. You have to have actually lived it, both the good parts and the bad. You have to ask yourself, what is it that you feel you should be doing with your time. ♪ I'm pickin' up good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Oom bop bop ♪ I'm pickin' up ♪ Good vibrations ♪ Good vibrations ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Oom bop bop excitations ♪ Good, good, good, good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Good, good, good, good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Close my eyes, she is somehow closer now ♪ ♪ Softly smile, I know she must be kind ♪ ♪ When I look in her eyes ♪ She goes with me to a blossom world ♪ ♪ I'm pickin' up good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Good bop bop, ♪ I'm picking up ♪ Good vibrations ♪ Good vibrations ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Ooh bop bop, excitations ♪ Good, good, good, good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Good, good, good, good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Oh oh oh, oh oh oh ♪ Ah ah oh my my ♪ Ah ♪ Good, good, good, good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Good, good, good, good vibrations ♪ ♪ She's giving me excitations ♪ Good, good, good, good vibrations ♪ - I was raised to believe that I, I didn't need to live in a box filled with other people's ideas. I remember having no plan at all. No, none. When we're young, we just act with no worries about the consequences or thinking about the why of it all.

Now, if we're all so different, why do we all seek out the same things in life. We all want to belong to something. But it's, it's not the same anymore as it used to be. We might live in different parts of the world but we're not purely defined by language or, or imaginary lines on the map. We're joined together by our ideas, by the way we think, by the way we view the world. ♪ We'll be fighting in the streets ♪ ♪ With our children at our feet ♪ ♪ And the morals that they worship will be gone ♪ ♪ And the men who spurred us on ♪ ♪ Sit in judgment of all wrong ♪ They decide and the shotgun sings the song ♪ ♪ I'll tip my hat to the new constitution ♪ ♪ Take a bow for the new revolution ♪ ♪ Smile and grin at the change all around ♪ ♪ Pick up my guitar and play ♪ We don't get fooled again ♪ The change, it had to come ♪ We knew it all along ♪ We were liberated from the fold, that's all ♪ ♪ And the world looks just the same ♪ ♪ And history ain't changed ♪ 'Cause the banners, they are flown in the next war ♪ ♪ I'll tip my hat to the new constitution ♪ ♪ Take a bow for the new revolution ♪ ♪ Smile and grin at the change all around ♪ ♪ Pick up my guitar and play ♪ Just like yesterday ♪ Then I'll get on my knees and pray ♪ ♪ We don't get fooled again, no, no ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ There's nothing in the streets ♪ ♪ Looks any different to me ♪ And the slogans are replaced, by-the-bye ♪ ♪ And the parting on the left ♪ Is now parting on the right ♪ And the beards have all grown longer overnight ♪ ♪ I'll tip my hat to the new constitution ♪ ♪ Take a bow for the new revolution ♪ ♪ Smile and grin at the change all around ♪ ♪ Pick up my guitar and play ♪ Just like yesterday ♪ Then I'll get on my knees and pray ♪ ♪ We don't get fooled again ♪ Don't get fooled again, no no ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ Meet the new boss ♪ Same as the old boss - In my lifetime I have noticed that there's been a huge shift towards an urban culture. But something's been lost as a result, the connection to the land. We have to remember that we are part of the planet in the same as animals, as trees, as well as anything else. And we have to connect to that because we are a part of it. The rhythms of nature. The only constant is change.

I'd say most people can probably remember those experiences, where we're living in a moment, where time seems to slow down, and we can describe every detail of that experience. And I think we hunt for those moments without often realizing it. Entire days of our lives that can past without meaning. Yet in those moments of absolute clarity, there's entire lifetime worth remembering. ♪ Get your motor runnin' ♪ Head out on the highway ♪ Lookin' for adventure ♪ And whatever comes our way ♪ Yeah darlin' go make it happen ♪ ♪ Take the world in a love embrace ♪ ♪ Fire all of your guns at once and ♪ ♪ Explode into space ♪ I like smoke and lightning ♪ Heavy metal thunder ♪ Racin' with the wind ♪ And the feelin' that I'm under ♪ ♪ Yeah darlin' go make it happen ♪ ♪ Take the world in a love embrace ♪ ♪ Fire all of your guns at once and ♪ ♪ Explode into space ♪ Like a true nature's child ♪ We were born, born to be wild ♪ ♪ We can climb so high ♪ I never wanna die ♪ Born to be wild ♪ Born to be wild ♪ Get your motor runnin' ♪ Head out on the highway ♪ Lookin' for adventure ♪ And whatever comes our way ♪ Yeah darlin' go make it happen ♪ ♪ Take the world in a love embrace ♪ ♪ Fire all of your guns at once and ♪ ♪ Explode into space ♪ Like a true nature's child ♪ We were born, born to be wild ♪ ♪ We can climb so high ♪ I never wanna die ♪ Born to be wild ♪ Born to be wild - So, - Okay so, that you just say we're here, and we're about to start a big drive up. Start of the trip. - Okay, okay, we're here. We started our big drive up, start of the trip. - Yeah. - We're at the er, the domes here, which is basically our launching point into the wild. Just kind of sorting out all the food, all the gear, all the logistics, and then first thing we'll load up the horses tomorrow and head deep into the back country here. Yeah, looking forward to the adventure ahead. - There's not many places left like this in the world I don't think, so we're pretty lucky to be able to be here and like just totally disconnect from everyone and everything. - Being in this setting versus like day-to-day life with life's distractions and so many divisions of our attention, and like just being here, you feel super like connected.

Pretty rad place. I, I don't even know of a word to describe it. - If I could do it all over again. Oh dear I've heard that one a few times, haven't I. The problem with that statement is that it's flawed. See if I did it all over again it wouldn't be the same would it? What keeps life interesting is that you never know what's going to happen next. I think that's why we're always searching for something new. We seem to be forever searching searching searching, but it's just, it's not easy. We live for those moments that rise above all others, so when everything comes together so perfectly, it's only possible once in a lifetime. That's what we're looking for, all of us, and when it happens, while it's happening, it's crystal clear. ♪ The mountain is high, the valley is low ♪ ♪ And you're confused on which way to go ♪ ♪ So I've come here to give you a hand ♪ ♪ And lead you into the promised land ♪ ♪ So, come on and take a free ride, free ride ♪ ♪ Come on and sit here by my side ♪ ♪ Come on and take a free ride ♪ All over the country I've seen it the same ♪ ♪ Nobody's winning at this kind of game ♪ ♪ We've gotta do better, it's time to begin ♪ ♪ You know all the answers must come from within ♪ ♪ So come on and take a free ride, free ride ♪ ♪ Come on and sit here by my side ♪ ♪ Come on and take a free ride ♪ Yeh yeh yeh yeh ♪ Yeh yeh yeh yeh ♪ Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh free ride ♪ - Time is always important.
