Oh, no! Listen to the cheater. Go on, keep going. Be careful, otherwise you'll get caught. Here comes the Aztec! Look very carefully. What is it? You weren't going to wait for me? Oh, no. ~ We all heard the rumor going around. ~ That was before I got involved. Can you see him? ~ Yeah. ~ How many are there? I see four or five. Duck if you want, they haven't discovered us yet. Who's the leader? The Aztec. He can piss the farthest, so he is. Then you have to stop playing with dolls,... ~ There's no cheating! ~ I'm going to go piss. I want to piss away! ~ Me too! ~ Get lost! Keep your arm really tight. Aim with your index finger the target. Close one eye. Stop! With the accuracy of a snake! The eye of the eagle! And the anger of the snake. ~ Now shoot! ~ Why did the snake twice? Damn. That's it. They're here. These bottle tops belong to Longeverne. Did I get him? ~ I didn't look. ~ You never look when it matters. You shut up. You know what I'm looking for! Look, he's coming. Now shut up, Shhh! Gibus hardly ever comes along by himself! How dare you come to our turf?! You're as good as toast. You're so stupid, Aztec. You can't eat me. In Velrans, everyone's dumb. We might be stupid in Velrans, but in Longeverne you're stupid limp dicks. ~ What are limp dicks? ~ I've got an idea, but... In Longeverne you don't know what limp dicks are? You fools probably need your mom to put on your underpants! ~ And your mother... ~ What about my mother? ~ Your mother's a mmmph... ~ Better be quiet, I'm warning you. ~ A... ~ Let him say it. What is my mother? ~ A rotten plum? ~ A rotten plum! That's right! ~ She's a rotten plum! ~ Who's that? And your mothers all smell like mushrooms! I tell you my opinion right smartly! An opinion is like an asshole! Everyone has his own! Stop it! It's not funny! ~ You're dead! ~ Time to boogie! Served them right! I'll get you! Now it's your turn! Come on, you lame-asses, we're getting them! Yeah! Now you'll see why I'm called Aztec! I'll crush you. Yeah! Bastards from Longeverne! You're full of shit! ~ Go to the right! ~ Which right? The other right. We'll teach these elephant butts! Be careful! Ha, sometimes he looks like Aztec-pur?e! Bye-bye, turkeys! I'll mark their graves with just a capital "A"! You're dead, you limp dicks! They're dead! Faster, faster! I'm trying, yes. Not because I... not because I'm afraid. Chief, we have to go! Come on, let's go. Who's that? Does he belong to our gang? Relax! That's nobody. He really showed them from Velrans what's what. He's called Lantern and he'll never belong to the gang! ~ Not a word to the anyone! ~ The more you explain... the less I understand! Ah, those are the Gibus brothers! Hi! What is it? ~ That's Marie, Tintin's sister! ~ Shut up! They accused us if being limp dicks! What? What's limp dicks? ~ Who said that? ~ The Velrans gang! ~ Isn't that something bad? ~ Good question. But why are you so offended? I have a hint of what the first word means. The second word is clear enough. Let's ask Lebrac, to see what he makes of it He's never there when you need him. You don't talk about Lebrac like that, understand!? Do you know what he's doing while you're still in bed? Every day, he's always up with the dawn,... ~ Even on Sunday! ~ Wake up, it's time! And he gets to work. Ever since his father died, he's done all the work on the farm and the market! He supports his mother and his sisters. In all of Longeverne there's no one better than Lebrac. Hey kid! Wait, wait, wait! This is for you! Buy yourself some sweets! Thanks, Mister! ~ Bastards from Longeverne! ~ Yeah! ~ You're dead, you limp dicks! ~ Yeah! Careful! ~ Ha, sometimes he looks like Aztec-pur?e! ~ We'll bury you! I'll mark their graves with just a capital "A"! ~ That's Lebrac, show some respect! ~ And what do they mean by "limp dicks"? This means war! The Velrans can forget the word "peace" for all time! Down with the Velrans! The way's marked on the signpost. Well, we'll see. BO-TIZE-MA-CARAM-GAL-GAD- TRUFF-SNICK-BUS-KI-CAV... Let's go. Hi. Hi. ~ Hi. ~ Hi. Hi. A writer chooses precise and descriptive words,... to induce original and expressive images. "War Council" is misspelled. No one could understand that. We have two rhetorical devices. ~ No one gives a damn! ~ Who can tell us... the difference between a metaphor... and an oxymoron? Mister Lebrac, maybe? Only one of them is still in use. Why would you say that? An oxymoron, ummm,... comes from "oxidize". And metaphor comes from "metal". So is one of them rusted. That was very amusing. ~ Will there be a battle today? ~ Shhh! Otherwise we are still caught by the teacher. You can have fun later on, after school lets out. An oxymoron combines contradictory terms. For example, a quiet storm. There you go. Why do I have to threaten you to get you to participate? There'll be trouble! And what if you get detention every afternoon?! Maybe you'd like some help to improve your humble notes. Mister, apologize. Haven't you forgotten something important, Mister Lebrac? Wouldn't it better if you said: "'I' apologize"? The pronoun "I" shouldn't be omitted. What you said implied that it was MY behavior which warranted the apology. In detention, you can recapitulate upon this use of pronouns. And thus chance of a battle today fizzled out. BO-TIZ-MA-GAL-GAD... TRUFF-SNICK-BUS-KI-CAV Who are our enemies? Ari... Arithmetic, spinach and celery. Spinach and celery, arithmetic, and chemistry. Being beaten by Dad and Mom,... but above all, our enemies from Velrans! What are your duties? To preserve the honor of Longeverne,... to march ahead in spite of all dangers. To lie to our parents,... rather than let Lebrac down. You are worthy to be admitted into our army. As the little brother of Grangibus, your name is now Tigibus. Tigibus? But they already call me Tigibus. Wouldn't "Destroyer" or "Head Cruncher" be better? Go greet the chief. I don't like Tigibus. Well, then just Tigibus. ~ Who exactly has offended us? ~ The Aztec. ~ "Limp dicks," he says. ~ Limp dicks. Yeah. Is it just me, but I don't get it. And he wants to crush us all, too. Don't worry about that. Anyway, the Velrans are as superfluous as the Pope's cock. Unfortunately I'm not free to direct the slaughter this evening. So we will form a task force. ~ What's that? ~ The worst nightmare of Velrans! ~ Who volunteers? ~ Me! Tigibus, you're too small for this. We can't watch out for little tykes. It could distract us. I'll take out the loudspeaker. ~ Bataille, you take care of the priest. ~ No. ~ Why do I always have to take care of the pastor? ~ Shhh. I packed up the glue earlier. Yeah! Goal! We'll keep going. Don't get discouraged! 3 - 0, Father! Take a lesson from our Lord Jesus Christ. ~ He never let his shoulders droop. ~ Yeah, he couldn't. What? What did you say, Bacaille? Excuse me, Father, but he couldn't. Couldn't... Hand over the ball. Now! The subject doesn't inspire you, Lebrac? What would I know about freedom? You'll think of something. Homework, work at home, the punishments. And soon I'll be working in Mister Jeanjean's factory. There'll be even less freedom and more obligations! Right. You have to choose between Mister Jeanjean's factory... or coming back to schoolwork. You have what it takes. Assuming you want to be independent. My definition of freedom? This is it. And of independence? This is it! I've got to milk the cows! This is my choice! Free kick! Have you finished? ~ Father, he can't run anymore. ~ Again? ~ Is it Lacrique? ~ Can I put myself on the bench? Yeah, of course. So play on! ~ Hurry up. ~ Your prayers were answered, Bacaille. Wait. Everything's all right. Lord, give me patience. Starting right now! Have patience! Immediately! What? Who needs music? Let's start again. Thanks, Lebrac, for taking me in. Now I'm a real man, since I belong to the gang. ~ I'm going to... ~ You'll do nothing. And they won't even notice. How can they notice nothing if we attack them? They'll be suffering from limp dicks! ~ I thought we weren't limp dicks? ~ Yeah, exactly! There's Lanterne. ~ Go away, we said! ~ You're not invited. Girls can only sew. ~ Is she really a girl or boy? ~ Half boy, she is! Probably a successful girl! Small vocabulary instruction:... "LIMP DICKS" Composed of "dick", a noun...a vulgar term for penis. And "limp", an adjective, meaning something without strength. Put the two words together, and you've got you. A carrot-top, a priest's son,... a large sheep,... and finally, a limp dick! I'm not like that, but anyway, I have an advantage! What? I'll never have a limp dick, but yours needs a splint! So what do you want to do in Velrans? The sewing, of course! I'm just a girl! Shhh! What did he say? Gibus, go on. The rest follow me! Well, yeah, I'm going. Come on. We move on "Three". But there's only two of us. Here we go. And up now. Do you know what we're doing here? Isn't that too dangerous? No way! Whoa, you're getting heavy! What do you see? He's stark naked. His mother's soaping him. ~ Really? ~ Yeah. ~ He is naked? ~ Yeah, he is stark naked. ~ And she's scolding him. ~ Not so loud! ~ His mother's hitting him with the soap. ~ Yeah, I understood. ~ Serves him right! ~ Yeah, he's the one with the limp dick. Tell you what --- let's steal his pants! Great idea! Then he'll know everyone can see a limp dick. Grab his pants. Right now. There! So if they do not understand... Hey, Lebrac, we'd better boogie, or we'll get caught. Not bad, huh? I wonder, is "assholes" one word or two? Jeez! Never fear. Admit it, you were scared! That's Zephirin! And his wacky mutt! Quick, the sausage. Take it easy, Carmen! Do you have a scent? A piece of sausage! Such villains! Shit, that's the limit! ~ We did it! ~ We did it! Forward! Out of my way! The war has started again! Yeah! There's the Gibus brothers! We have a trophy! I've got it here! We grabbed it! Tigibus! Aztec is a limp dick! ~ Where the Hell have you been? ~ Did you even look at the clock? It's 9 o'clock, now let's go! Off to bed! Have you done your homework? Good luck at home. Don't worry. There you are! Ha? Who were you with? Ha? ~ What would your brother say? ~ Tintin isn't here! "Tintin isn't here." You've certainly got his bad habits! And you're also wearing his clothes. I'm sorry, Mama. I delivered the milk bottles,... ~ But it took longer than usual. ~ Bring in the wood and feed the animals! ~ What about my homework? ~ This is your homework: wood and feed the animals. And Mister Jeanjean will be coming by tomorrow. You start next month. Lanterne... Thanks. ~ For helping Tigibus this morning. ~ Glad to. How do you know about that? It's the chief's job to know. Oh, by the way,... "Ass" is written with the masculine article, "Mister-I-know-everything". Good night. Yeah, exactly. Good night. The school door was smeared with mashed-up dessert. This is an unprecedented act of vandalism. But the culprit will now be given an opportunity to confess. I will be lenient. I'm waiting. No one? I see. I will tolerate no violation of decency and morality, understand? ~ The culprits will be unmasked and punished! ~ Hey, there's a piece of string under tension. Hey, there's a piece of string tension. And until further notice, you all get a six... for misconduct. Shit! Quiet! Now bring out your exercise books. ~ They'll pay! ~ I'm drenched! And here's the proof that we really weren't behind this. Then who was it? Why should we smear ourselves with ink? It was those limp dicks from Longeverne. Hey, Mister, I'm done. No. ~ Oh no. ~ Everything is immaculate. Very funny. We must always wait for you, Mister Lacrique. What are the necessary qualities to be a citizen? You have to...uh... to be or not to be... To be or not be. Are you performing "Hamlet" here in front of us, Lacrique? Lacrique is rather theatrical today. ~ You must have hair on your ass! ~ You must have hair on your ass. I meant "arm". I understand why you laugh over "hair on your ass". I meant you have to grow a beard. Shall I give you a good one or would you rather a detention? I'd rather have a good one. Sit down! Not you, Lacrique. I mean the neighbor right behind you, the great Lebrac. In the theatre he'd make a terrible prompter. Who are your accomplices? ~ But Papa... ~ What? Are you up to something else? Sit down again, it's just Mister Labru. ~ Mister Labru? ~ Merlin. Labru. Ah, this is how boys are educated in Longeverne? To write stupid things on doors,... not to rise upon the entry of an adult?! Will it turn into Velrans, where you don't even knock? And dragging kids around by their arms? Bravo, Labru! At least my students know "assholes" is written as one word! I'm glad you're familiar with the rich wide world of familiar insults! Let's start with "limp dicks"! We in Longeverne are very old fashioned, almost humble,... we content ourselves with words from the dictionary. Very well. If I do say so... Well, I'll tell you! Limp dicks. You don't know what that means since it's not in the dictionary, right? ~ What do you say? ~ Limp dicks! ~ You dare say that here? ~ Now I say it, yeah. "Limp dicks"! Well, so if I were to say... that if you wrote "assholes" as two words, you wouldn't understand it! So that's how it is? You go squeal to your old man. Let's see how it looks in the singular:... ~ "Asshole." ~ "Limp dick." You're just itching for a beating, aren't you? ~ Wouldn't you like to have one! ~ Later, you limp dick! Asshole! ~ Limp dick! ~ Crazy asshole. The article? Battle tonight. Yeah, just after sunset. Stupid asshole. There's a battle tonight! ~ Big limp dick! ~ Tonight, they say. ~ Big dick limp! ~ Large, stupid asshole. Great parenting! Please, everyone respect the teacher! ~ Was there anything else? ~ No! Let's go! In Longeverne, the voice of reason will fail! They must have the best minds. ~ Oh! The spirit of Velrans is among us. ~ Exactly. The spirit of education! If you give them enough homework,... then they wouldn't write on the walls of my school. Oh, Yeah? Your kids spray ink everywhere in the name of education? Beat it! Fried fish! Labru, what was that? ~ "Labru, the girl in the tutu." ~ Exactly. ~ You can kiss my ass. ~ Just the two of us... Now we put in an extra hour of spelling. Thanks to Mister Labru. In the future you will know how to write swear words! Sit down! Yeah, Lebrac? ~ Not now, Mister. ~ Why not? The curse on the door. It wasn't anyone else. It was me. For a perfect "asshole" you happen to need one word... even in Velrans they learn that. Sir! ~ I was there. ~ Me, too! Me, too, Mister. Me, too! Me, too! Me, too! ~ Me, too, Mister. ~ Me, too! Fine. Win the following game: free your friends from the detention. 10 questions, 10 answers. With five correct answers, Lebrac is free tonight! Sit down. Ah, Mister Gibus, then we'll start with you. When was the coronation of Charlemagne? Oh, yeah...um...that's a breeze. 4810! I know that for sure. That's the height of Mont Blanc, you idiot! Who knows who the son of Francis the first was? Mister Gibus? Francis the zeroth? The revolution of 1789 was on 8 May 1945? The stories of La Fontaine were written anonymously. What distinguishes the male from the female? The man has a brain... and the woman has everything else. And who first wrote the famous words: "To be or not to be"? Lacrique. Lebrac? We'll see you in detention. ~ Should we go to war without Lebrac? ~ No, it would be too risky. And what about Camus? He'd agree with me. ~ Camus, what do you think? ~ We can't go without Lebrac! ~ Why not? ~ We have to defend the village! You're right. How brave you are. Because I'm Colonel! I'm a colonel! He wasn't last night but now he's a general! Where's she going? Hey, Lanterne! You going to fight by yourself. Yeah, because the limp dicks are too cowardly. I made it perfectly clear that we're not cowards. Well, then? Well... ~ Will you do anything? ~ Well...we have to... Do what? Well, so...Come on, let's go! ~ Is she watching us? ~ Yeah, I think so. Hey, guys, wait for me. ~ Give it over! ~ Hurry! That's mine! Hurry up! I'll be right there. Your sword. It would be a shame if they noticed that we've got a girl with us. Let's tie her up! Knock her out. Or hide her. Come here. Come here. ~ You're keeping watch! ~ No, this is our place! ~ I'm the highest rank, you'll keep watch. ~ This's not a reason. Lebrac gives the orders. Wear this! Camouflage. Get into position. Me first! Spread out! Lacrique, that way! Bacaille, over there. The Gibus brothers here. You limp dicks are as quiet as a fanfare of mammoth farts! Do you think with your ink stains you're invisible, you squid? Show yourselves, rather than eat mud! My ass and your face are the same friends. You refugee from a toilet! Where's Lebrac? You're nothing but a pus pimple! ~ You're bottom of the bowl! ~ We'll see about that! Your boots have athlete's foot. We will annihilate you! You pig's ass! Ugly tadpole. Your mouth stinks like my grandma's smelly feet. You know what your mother is? Don't say anything wrong. A rotten plum. Attack! Longeverne, for its honor! BO-TIZE-MA-CARAM-GAL-... GAD-TRUFF-SNICK-BUS-KI-CAV... What's such a broken-down gnome doing here? Aztec, the watermelon. ~ You microbe! ~ Back at you! ~ I'll show you... ~ Aztec, you're stupid and disgusting. I've shown you. Pull! We're at war! Let go of me! Fleeing gang of wimps! We won! Velrans! You toilet brushes! We have a prisoner? Now we'll see! We don't want you! You're just a girl. Get lost, there's some sewing that needs doing. Beat it! Yeah, you piss-sitter! Go away! You fucking limp dicks! You're not men enough to do anything at all! At least we have some. Back off. Well, now it's just you, Papier-M?ch?, huh? You don't scare me! Teeny cock! And dick is a dirty word, even for something as insignificant as yours! Yours will be cut off. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait, Camus! No, not the buttons! Camus, knock it off! Not my buttons! You can't image what would happen if I went home without them. Stop it, Camus! Camus, let me go, let me go! Not my buttons! This is pretty shabby, even for you! So shabby... Let him go! Here, have your buttons! You like rivets? You're all rivets! Good... A little too short, Lebrac. But very good syntax. And good quotes. But next time, save your scribbles. ~ A 3? ~ As you see. A small fat lady... ~ Where are they? ~ You have to go to the river. Lantern served them just as bait. Hurry, Camus needs you! ~ We behaved like raw recruits. ~ Next time we'll surround them! ~ Yeah. ~ We have to coordinate tactically. ~ What if we dig a tunnel under the river? ~ Don't talk nonsense. We could disguise ourselves as trees. Oh, my slingshot. Aztec... ~ What did they do? ~ Everything was cut off. They'll pay for this! Grab your weapons and follow me! Come on! ~ Forward! ~ Revenge! ~ Lanterne? ~ Hide! Lanterne! ~ Lanterne! ~ No, Lebrac! Good catch, men. Where's Lanterne? Cut through the rope. It'll be a long time before you see her again. Come on, everyone get him! It's Lebrac! They've caught him! Don't worry! Do you want to leave already? Where do you want to go off to? Papier-m?ch?! Send him home! Avenge yourself, Papier-m?ch?! Avenge yourself! Go on! Avenge yourself. Now the fun begins for the first time. You've been playing this too simple, what's going on? The first. Quiet! You'll get into real trouble with your parents, Lebrac! Only two more to cut! Look, you forgot one! Not before this feast is over! His pants! His pants! What? Haven't you noticed that I'm a girl? Yeah. So what else is new? But if I had pants on, you wouldn't carry me. And you wouldn't be able to save yourself. Careful! This is so romantic. They're only flowers that fall down. No, how you shouted "Lanterne" --- plunged screaming into enemy territory. That's romantic. This is just...ummm... As leader, I have to... ~ Save me? ~ No, provide for my troop. Right, but you can put me down now. Ah, yeah, excuse me, of course! Thank you for welcoming me into your army! What? Well, what you just said. You saved me because you take care of your troops. So I'm part of the force. But thanks for the carry. Let's take the shortcut. "Lebrac --- Farming products" Was that your father's truck? After you, Ma'am. Where are we going? Into the country of independence! ~ Let's go! ~ We're on our way! To the right! ~ To the right! ~ Look out, a car! Steady on! I'm standing on them! To the left! The brake is jammed! I got it! Hey... Yeah? All leaders add a word to the secret code. ~ Right. ~ And your word's CAV? ~ Yeah. ~ What do you mean by "CAV"? It's from "Caviar". I've never actually eaten any,... but it's so incredibly expensive that it simply has to be the best thing in the world. It's seven clock. Isn't that Maurer. Why is he visiting you? ~ He needs an apprentice. ~ What about school? ~ You've got to continue in school... ~ Don't tell me what to do. Come here at once! I've been waiting for you for an hour. Look, I'm here, I'm sorry. I'll give you "Sorry"! And look at the state of you! ~ I don't care! ~ Out of my sight! Things will get better when you're out of the house! "'To be dependent on any independent person or institution:... "'injustice in the end produces independence.' Voltaire." What is he saying?! Where were you? Look at yourself! ~ I've done nothing wrong. ~ Brat! You can come out, Mom's not angry anymore. So I can go chop wood or something? Dad wouldn't have punished you. Dad has punished us all. He left... Are you leaving, too? ~ When I grow up. ~ But you are grown up! Well, when I get even bigger. So big that one must push aside the stars. And my first act as President will be to appoint the First Minister for Children. And then we will be independent! The first? And who will be last? You! And you! Marie! You have a girlfriend, don't you? No. Buy her some chocolates then. I don't have a lover! Girls like chocolate. On his last assignment, I gave him a 3. I think we should encourage him... With a 3, then? It doesn't take a genius to feed the animals and to fight every day. You know, he's very bright, but... we should strengthen his self-confidence. And we could help... Help? What do you really think I do all day? I won't allow you to judge. Madame Lebrac, I think you have misunderstood me... No! You have misunderstood me! I don't have the means to pay for it! He should be happy about the apprenticeship offer... ~ so he gets a decent career. ~ That's right. He can achieve a lot if... Do you think your speeches can turn him into someone special? He's already special. Mr. Merlin, if that's everything, I have to go feed the chickens. Pass! Come on, Camus! He shot over! The goal's open! Cover him! Where is my coverage? Yes! Stop! Go on. That was a foul. What is this? This is a friendly game! Behave like good Christians! Break it up! So let's keep playing! Camus! Go on, go on! Yeah! Defend. Pass it! Pass it! Yeah, pass it to the wing. Go on, Lebrac! Pass! Pass here! Stop them! Go on! That's a lousy foul. Go on, go on! No, no! That's against the rules! Let's see fair play! I beg you! That goal won't count! You, give me the ball. Don't you see him there? Exactly! Where's the ball? Velrans can only cheat and deceive! Longeverne stick-in-the-muds! Velrans cheat! Velrans are no good! Shit-eaters, you'll eat anything! ~ Merlin, Merlin, fried fish! ~ Little Labru, in a tutu! Hit right on the head! Swamp mushroom! ~ You little sissy! ~ Toad face! Garden Gnome! You old oyster-face. Red card, Lebrac! Red card! As a good Christian, one should always turn the other cheek. Here's for your other cheek! Break it up! Let's go, we should go now! What are we going to do in the church? Adjust the clock with the pendulum. ~ Lebrac fights well. ~ Yeah, not bad for a boy. Break it up! Right now! Fatso! What if He remembers this? Who? The good Lord would bring an apology,... which is signed by His parents. Mission accomplished! Down we go. Saint Eulalie! Stop it! In the name of the Father! Well, listen! God, my cassock! Do you think that they scored a goal? ~ The game is canceled! ~ Probably not. Stop! Stop! Tintin! Dad! He's home. There's Tintin. I'm glad you're back! Since you gave me the office of the Chief,... we've won 36 times against Velrans. ~ Do you remember Goat Cheese? ~ Goat Cheese, that shit. That was the biggest plague spot of Velrans! We met once at the front, in Algeria. We were being shot at from all directions. He was sprawled in the sun. "He choose the easy way," I said. Typical Velrans. So I crept closer. He lay still. Two meters away, lay his head. Just a mistake. There were some errors in the French artillery. Then I fainted. Then I went and threw up. And now they've given me one week of home leave. Now I'm here,... at home,... to celebrate! But he... What do you say? Want a smoke? NEWS FROM AROUND THE WORLD The first troops went ashore at the port of Algiers. The French military intervention is a major blow to the enemy. Oh, look at the explosion! Social reforms are not possible... Hinge traps! They try repeated attacks... No, no. Lacrique! Sit back down! One last honor guard for the fallen. Through about 30 attacks, countless people have lost their lives. Gentlemen, gentlemen! A little bit of attitude! This corruption has nothing to do with our lessons about Algeria! ~ The presentation is finished. ~ Father, please don't! Quiet, please! Hush, now! I want to thank you, Father. I hope these pictures will make you think. The lesson is over. No running in a house of worship! Nevertheless, the movie was good. You're not going home, Lebrac? All these people in Algeria,... are really in the war to get independence? Some go to war, while others try it without weapons. It's not always an option. Where is it written that life is easy? That's how it is. The other day you said that we could very well have a choice. ~ And now? ~ You're right. But you must know yourself, what you choose. I've made three decisions. To return to this village in my position. And I decided on GAL. GAL? ~ Mmmh. ~ GAL?! Don't pretend you don't understand. Have you never wondered what GAL means? BO-TIZE-MA-CARAM-GAL-GAD- TRUFF-SNICK-BUS-KI-CAV...Mhm? "Galet". That means stone. I was unbeatable in skipping stones. I simply won all the time. That's the reason I then became chief. ~ Girls in tutus! ~ Cardboard box! ~ Girls in tutus! ~ Cardboard box! So I chose GAL,... while those who voted against me,... chose the guy who loved caramels! Are you still unbeatable at skipping stones? This should be tested at once. What do you think? I guess I'd beat you. You can't be serious? Sure! Let's wait and see. Homework first. ~ I got the stone to bounce 16 times! ~ That's 16 points better than in math! Home already? Yeah. I have a lot of homework today! I'll do my milk round later. Then I leave you alone. ~ Do you have to tell me something? ~ Huh? Where did the money come from? This is mine. Hard earned! I do not even have enough to buy your sister a cloak! Where did that money come from? None of your business! I always share everything. You dare to say such a thing? I do nothing else in this life but share. And my health is going down the drain. ~ And I have no choice. ~ But you do. The whole world has a choice. Then I leave the choice to you. Either you buy you candy, or your little sister a cloak! I hate you! Independence means... be dependent on no person or institution. We add a new meaning: the independence of children. But what do you mean by independence? That we decide for ourselves. And help each other. It means to decide freely. No detentions and no punishments! Those who are good at schoolwork will help the others. ~ I'm good at math ~ I like that. But when we come home ripped up, we get beaten up by our parents. Not any more! We sew the buttons back on first. That's the definition of freedom. ~ Can we just do that? ~ Just as our elders! First we work in the school. At home we work hard, too. In addition, we defend the village from the Velrans. ~ We are braver than anyone! ~ This is true. That's what happens when no one can be called to account. And we'll prove it! BO-TIZE-MA-CARAM-GAL-GAD- TRUFF-SNICK-BUS-KI-CAV... It's up to us! We'll build a fort on the truck. The Ministry of Children! We need a sign that says "Forbidden for Parents". We need wood and rope to fix everything up. Here we go! I'm going! I think we're onto something good here. We have earned a day off. ~ Oh, yeah. ~ A break. ~ Good idea. ~ Oh, yeah. Who's done his homework? Oh no, I'm too tired! Me, too.

But you love me, don't you? But you don't know it yet. In a church, such objectionable passages are not to be viewed. ~ Marian, will you come with me? ~ Just like Sherwood? My mother told me off again because a button was missing. But if we do not go to battle, we're just bags of ass cheek leather. Ass cheek leather! Yeah, there's a solution! Will we always be slapped by parents whenever a button is missing? We don't need them! ~ Our parents? ~ Oh no! Clothes! ~ We'll fight naked! ~ Are you crazy? No way, Jos?. Well, when you say naked...do you mean like Adam and Eve? Sure, but they didn't have to fight. My bagpipe wasn't meant for the open air. We know why! Your father, he drinks like a fish... ~ and you have a wine stain on your butt! ~ Fuck you! First, he never drinks more than two liters per day... All right. Who's for fighting bare? Sure, I'm there with it. Why not? Excuse me. I agree. You fooled me! A minute ago you were against it. If you can down your pants now, then we need not discuss this further. ~ There's nothing to see! ~ Prove it! Here? Where the little baby Jesus could ogle my tulip? The baby Jesus is naked, too.

We labor away as slaves,... and we still get punished by our parents! What's wrong with freedom and independence? He's right. But everything was OK earlier! Who said that independence is easy? For a week, there was no detention and no punishment! And now for the best: we'll celebrate. Not later than Sunday in eight days. A festival without adult! Free! And indeed with all the trimmings! You, Lebrac, you'll bring candy? ~ So much so that your belly bursts! ~ And firecrackers? Of course! You're going to change your minds over some silly candy? ~ Chocolate? ~ Even chocolate! ~ Cotton candy. ~ I want some candy apples, for Octavia. Apples and love, and even girls! This Sunday will go down in the history of France! Hey, Lebrac how will you pay for that? All this'll cost real money. Yeah, how? By working, just like the grownups. Hey, guys, you forgot me! You forgot me! Let us earn money! Fresh Flowers! Fresh Flowers! Buy a bouquet of fresh flowers. Fresh Flowers! Do you want something refreshing?

Candy apples! ~ Thank you! ~ Bye! You have to wait until I get some small change! Be right back! Look, wonderful decoys! They will also sing like nightingales! Hello, Bacaille! ~ Take it, sir! ~ I'm sorry. ~ It fell down. ~ Yeah, yeah, sure! ~ Go on, scram! ~ Can I buy it? Buy what? ~ Chocolate. ~ Do you have money? ~ So, four chocolate bars for everyone! ~ He doesn't want one! ~ Sure? ~ Yeah. Then only three. Thanks, Mister. You're really sure? ~ Your decision. ~ Stupid, that tastes not bad. Sweet, your little bird! You, my little bird do you dream of flying? Normally I don't steal. Please don't tell it the others. He feels safe, even though I could crush him. I don't know what you want, but say nothing to Lebrac. What do I want? I just want to share some chocolate, brother. That's all. We know each other, but unfortunately only through the beatings. ~ I don't want to be a traitor. ~ Traitor? Who's talking about traitors? Oh, no! You are more likely something just like a friend of Velrans. Don't get mad over some chocolate. ~ I won't be a traitor. ~ Come on. ~ That was very easy. ~ Far too easy. Lollipops, chocolates or fruit candy, nougat? What should it be? A candy apple. Decoys to bill and coo! Hey, you folks in love,... a decoy to bill and coo complacent? To you, Lebrac, you want to get people to bill and coo? Oh, I'd like to flirt, yeah! ~ Give me one. ~ Can you choose one? I'll take that one! ~ How much is this one, Lebrac? ~ Two sous. Two sous? ~ Please. ~ Thank you. You're not going to buy cigarettes, are you? Yeah, Yeah! Go on, then. Have a nice day! Octavia. Octavia! Octavia, here's your... Gather around, children! Hello! Hello, my son! I'm glad you came, Father! We've been waiting for you. ~ May I help you with this...? ~ No, this is highly fragile. Then I'll take care of the umbrella myself. This won't take long. You can get set up like we discussed! So, the little ones to the front and the big ones in back. Sit down, please,... while the Father Simon assembles his equipment. Help me dear Merlin, instead of talking nonsense. Yes, of course, one thing at a time. Na, na, na, quiet. ~ And fold your arms. ~ We're almost ready. Now quiet, children. Get ready. Maybe I could hold something? Excuse me? That is to say: yeah. ~ That would go on top? ~ Watch out, you're hurting me. That should get there. What did I tell you? Once there... Enough of that! I'm getting impatient here... We can take the picture without the umbrella. Look, we have natural light! Would you rejoin the children? And smile! Why don't you smile? If not, I won't take the shot. The photo is cancelled. Even easier than taking a blackbird from its nest. Sunday, you say? After the fair. FESTIVAL OF THE BUTTONS. NEXT SUNDAY IN THE HUT. On Monday, a history test. Apply yourself over the weekend. You've been warned. ~ Bye! ~ Bye! Yeah, bye! Mom? Your teacher wants to talk to us. There is a high school in Montauban. Do you know Montauban? ~ Montauban? ~ Mmmh. Yeah, it's a bit far, but you can come home on weekends. They offer scholarships to students whose families are in need. But why me? Because you are teachable, Lebrac! ~ If you study, you can pass the entrance exam. ~ What an opportunity. You don't look happy. What will you do without me? Do not worry on my account, I'll get by. It's your decision. I can't do it. I can't leave my mother alone. You're going to go and you're going to learn! ~ I don't know. All those people... ~ Quiet! And when you come back, you'll have all the opportunities. For example, "First Minister of Children". Promise me. I agree. Congratulations, Lebrac. Don't worry. On Sunday, someone from the school will come to test you. On Sunday? ~ I don't see anything! ~ It must mean trouble. I've heard that Aztec's band's hanging around our cabin. We have to go, everything will be wrecked! You want to go there without Lebrac? They'll take you apart. As soon as fighting comes along, you pull your tail between your legs. On Sunday. Yeah, Sunday. Here he comes! ~ Lebrac, we have been waiting for you to... ~ I don't care! ~ What's got into him? ~ Leave me alone! What's wrong with you? Now leave me alone with all your shit! Your idiotic bullshit war! And even with that stupid "festival of the buttons". What? Are you going to play with your friends? Looks like we needed a new leader. Wasn't he your best friend? Is this your way to be a friend? Just one time he shows some weakness and you drop him? Didn't you understand what he said? Mutual help, independence! Is a boss just to add to your secret code word? No, Lebrac would never let one of us down! Fine... Those who still feel like celebrating, raise their hands. So, no celebration. No celebration. No Lebrac. Why has Lebrac called off the party? Lebrac and his stupid ideas. You're not in the cabin to prepare for the feast? It's called off. No celebration. No Lebrac. Do the others know? ~ Everyone knows. ~ No, this isn't true. I hate the church. Hello. Hello, Madame. I sacrificed my Sunday just for you, Mister Lebarque. Lebrac. Take a seat. How beautiful you are again. Why is he going to school on Sunday? There will determine whether he should go on studying. ~ Mom, may we go? ~ Yeah, yeah, we're going. You go on ahead, I'll catch up. Do you find your answers outside, Mister Lebarque? Mister Lebarque? Lebrac, not Lebarque! Like the great Braque! Now, Mister Lebrac... Let's talk about the oxymoron. What is an oxymoron, please? An oxymoron... Listen to you mumble! If you don't know, then you just say so. Next question! Never mind me, go on as if I'm not here. However, about the oxymoron:... that's when... It was the day when the door at the school at Velrans was smeared. I'm sure you remember the rest. An oxymoron combines two contradictory terms. For example, "Quiet Storm". I was getting a little worried. Let's get to conjugation. The verb "to walk" in the second subjunctive. The verb in the second subjunctive... Wasn't that when the cattle market was? "That I went, that you went,... "that he went..." Give me the most important discoveries of Louis Pasteur. In 1880, he weakened anthrax by heating... and converted it into a vaccine. And in 1885 he developed the vaccine against rabies. Very good. How high is Mont Blanc? 4807 meters. Who assassinated Henry IV? Ravaillac. Ravaillac... Would you care to leave us alone, please? What is a trigonometric function? A trigonometric function... Is that from mathematics? No, actually I mean geometry. I know how a tangent is derived. ~ Have I failed? ~ Yes. For this question, you have failed. But that's nothing unusual. Trigonometry is not normally asked in this test. But you're supposed to learn from us. I was just curious if you... You'll take me? You get the scholarship. Nevertheless, I feel compelled to add a comment. Your approach lacks a certain seriousness... ~ I'll... ~ Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude. But outside, all my friends are waiting,... a girl and a celebration. I don't want to disappoint anybody, so is the test is over? Yes. Jesus and his parents went to Jerusalem every year for Passover. When he was 12 years old, they made the pilgrimage as usual. The festival was called off. We have to stop the lightning attack! ~ There's no party? ~ No! Believe me! That's interesting. Let me tell you something important I want to say:... I don't trust a traitor. ~ Believe me, I... ~ No. ~ I swear to you, Aztec... ~ No. Praised be Jesus Christ. Forever and ever, amen. We're celebrating the Festival of the Buttons! Everyone come along! The Festival of the Buttons! Yeah, let's go! Girls, all this is for you! ~ Everything's for us? ~ Thank you! ~ Won't you ask me? ~ To dance? Are you crazy? Octavia, let's dance, come on! Octavia, I have a candy apple! That was on another day. Today I like cotton candy! Cotton candy? Where on Earth could I get that? I don't know it, find out! ~ I want another drink. ~ Me, too. Not bad. When I grow up sometime, I'm smoking. And I'll be an alcoholic. ~ Old fool. ~ Yeah... ~ You see, I can skip, too. ~ Not bad for someone from Velrans. ~ Yeah? ~ Yeah. ~ Nine. ~ Ten! Twelve. ~ Passable. ~ New round! Merlin, cardboard box. No! No, no. ~ What? ~ What is it? Labru in a tutu. Good. Asshole. Ten, eleven, twelve. ~ My little Mister Labru was so nice. ~ Yeah, yeah, sure. Did you see that? You rarely see such a good toss. Nice! Thanks. Dad bought it to celebrate my brother's coming back. I swiped it. Caviar! I managed 15. I managed 15, bastard! Labru, only seven, only seven! Limp dick. It runs fine, limp dick. ~ We want to go for heavier? ~ As in the past? ~ At least two? ~ Go. It's never worked. Very good, you caught me. Two! The celebration is over, you termites. He'll crush us. That's Aztec! Run, Tigibus! Yeah, move! Crush these microbes! Come on! I'll give you your war. I've found something better. I'll do... you all! Lebrac! He's crazy. Go on! Go on! To one side. I'll wrap up his legs! The party continues! Lebrac, you're the best! Long live Longeverne! Hail Longeverne! Lebrac, you're the best! But we would never betray our friends! Not like you limp dicks! Fucking traitor! It's not my fault. I'm tired of the eternal... of always being the loser. I just wanted to give someone a candy apple. All this for a candy apple? No. For you. Mom looks bad! It wasn't her fault! She looks worn out to me. ~ Here, Mom. ~ Thanks. Did you dance much? And there was cake? And quite a lot of candy! The best part was a real fireworks. Very loud! A fireworks display? And there were tarts and bramble? ~ Can I have some? ~ Maybe. But clean your room first. And get washed up. Let's run a race? I'll be milking the cows. My big boy... Let's get cleaned up. So, as you know, Lebrac will be leaving us today. To help you say goodbye to him, I have decided, exceptionally... to extend the recess until his bus leaves. You can go out. What's she up to now? She's crazy. I think I've found the new Chief. You need imagination, courage, and judgment. Someone who'll never let you down. A small light. A Lanterne. ~ Lanterne's a girl! ~ And you're a fool! What can I say? You can say the secret code. Ah, I'll do that, good. And add a secret word. BO-TIZE-MA-CARAM-GAL-GAD- TRUFF-SNICK-BUS-KI-CAV... -WILL. ~ What is the Will? ~ Will? William! William! William Lebrac... Bon Voyage... Never fear! He'll be the Minister of the Children? He already is. And you know what you going to do? Everyone with me! Attack! Down with the Velrans!
