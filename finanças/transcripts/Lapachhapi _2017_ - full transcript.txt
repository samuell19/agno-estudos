I want to play with your baby... No..please.. Don't do anything to my baby... Lapachhapi (Hide N Seek) - Ouch!! -Is it paining a lot? No.. Don't worry.. I am fine. At least tell me what happened? Neha.. Let it be... Okay listen.. As I stepped out of the office Altaf's goons surrounded me, and started asking for money... I requested them to give me some more ti to arrange for the money But they were in no mood to listen... they just started beating me.. How can you be so casual about it? So what do you want me to do? So no-one came to your rescue when all of this was happening? Bhaurao came at once along with a couple of other drivers... Thank god they came on time or else things would have been worse... So where are we going now? Bhaurao is taking us to his village... it's far away from here... No-one will come looking for us there... I have also thrown away the sim-card.. so we can't be traced. Where exactly is this village? My village is quite far... People in the city wouldn't even have heard about it... Those goons will not be able to guess that you are there. Don't worry... We'll come back as soon a things are in control... You don't need to worry when I am by your side... Are you trying to console me or yourself I am not trying to console either of us. I know you are not scared of such small issues... I have always loved you for your courage - Tushar, when will we reach? - I think.... Madam, we are almost there.. Just being careful as the road is bumpy. -See, we are almost there... - Drive carefully... - Sure (Tushar and Bhaurao murmuring) We have reached... You must be tired... Come... All these fields belong to Bhaurao... Bhaurao, are you sure we'll be fine here? Yes absolutely, Both me and my wife will take good care of you... Don't you worry... I'll help you with the luggage... Let's go... Sir...You can take that..... Hey you son of a bitch... What are you staring at?... Get lost... Madam.. don't worry... He is the village fool.. He keeps roaming around... You stay without fear... No-one can harm you here... Do one thing.. Follow that path in the f It'll lead you to our house... Here is your bag... I'll hide the car and come... Walk carefully... There is no network over here... hmm.. doesn't matter... Come this way.. Tushar.. we are away from home in a far-away village among unknown peop it doesn't feel right... I've thought hard before taking this dec I've known Bhaurao since a long time... and i trust him... You must really trust him a lot to bring in my eighth month...isn't it? -Go slow -Be careful Neha, do you remember the first time we Yes, how can i forget? - I had seen you at the entrance of our - hmm - i still remember how you were staring - hmm... it was love at first sight for me and you proposed in three days! what if someone else had snatched you aw but you agreed... we got married... and now you are going to be the mother of my child.. In this past year, have I ever given you a chance to complain? - you want to know the truth? - do try this past year has been the most beautiful year of my life... and so will the rest of our life... - is that so? - yes absolutely be careful there... seems quite far... yes... i can finally see something... Tushar!! Then who are you? What? If you are Tushar then who's this? No.. you can't be Tushar.. You are an imposter... Tushar!! Let me set you right... First find the right path to the house! I'll find it right away... -We entered through this path.. right? - yes Bhaurao had asked us to follow the path. But here there are many paths and each looks the same... Which one to take? I know which one leads to the house... Which one? I always knew you were intelligent... Let me confirm... you rest for a bit her Does my baby know where we have come today? Your dad will be back soon to take us to the new house... Don't be scared... We'll go and look for dad... Okay? Tushar?... Tushar?... Please don't be scared madam... What happened Neha? Are you alright? Please come in sir... You would be?? I am Bhalerao's wife Tulsi... He had told me that you would be coming here... Bless us... Please let it be... I am here now... I will take care of madam... and also of this little felow... Please freshen up... Come dear... I'll keep dinner ready... Please have a seat... Madam.. Can you please get those plates for dinner? The sugarcane harvest looks good.. Yes, the rains have been good this year Looks like good times are upon us... Please take... Does anyone live in this house? We used to stay here till about 10-12 years back.. What about the other room? I saw a door on the other side while coming... My younger brother used to stay there.. We moved out after he left us... Where did he go? He died!!! Please have the food while its hot... I hope you like it... Its really nice... So... now this house remains closed? We opened it only for you guys... otherwise we would have never opened it... But... we didn't see any other house nearby? Where do the other villlagers stay? The houses are in the fields... But the fields are so vast that you can't spot them... But you don't worry at all.. I will be by your wife's side all the time... It will be good for her to have another woman with her in this stage of pregnancy... After all, humanity is all about helping each other... Sir here has helped my husband a lot... now its our turn... Oh god!!! See what happened? A little distraction... and everything burns to ashes... Please eat well... Get a good night's sleep... Worrying is not good for the baby... I will be back in the morning... Good ni -Let's leave... -Come -Let's go inside... -These people are still stuck in their age-old traditions...isn't it? Even today, the wife eats only after the husband has finished eating... Anyway, it shouldn't matter to us... We are here only for a few days... That's true... But they are so warm and friendly... Anyway, mingling with people comes so naturally to you You know what I like most about you? That you build relationships really fast... That's what happened in our case too... But this habit of yours could land you in trouble someday... Daddy went off to sleep... But you are still awake... right? Listening to everything that your mother has to say.. It's time to sleep now...alright? How did you find these new people? Bhaurao? Tulsi? Please let me do it... I will fill the buckets... You must not be used to doing such things in the city... Oh god! That looks like a bad wound. I will get you some medication to apply on it. Don't worry. It has almost healed. Sir, please come... I will show you our fields... yes.. let's go... - let me wear my shoes - Please do - I will be back See you soon... So.... Did you get good sleep last night? Yes, I slept alright... It did take a while to fall asleep... It's a new place... You will get used to the place in a day or two... No.. that wouldn't be necessary. Tushar was saying that we'll leave at the earliest... What happened? Why are you looking at me like this? Err... No.. Nothing... here we don't address our husbands by their first name... But we call each other by our first names Okay, you get ready.. I will also finish my chores... - Tulsi, even I want to see your fields. Ahhh... yes... yesss let's go.. you want to see the fields, right? I think I should pay a visit to our home tomorrow only... For how long can we hide like this? Some or the other day we'll have to go back... Give it a few more days... Once things get back to normal, we both will go back together... No... it's not right to stay here for long... let me go and assess the situation there.. So you are leaving me alone here? Let me also come along... That's not possible... I can't put my son's life in danger... And what about me? I am doing all this for your safety. I will not be worried if you are here with Tulsi... - But... - Please don't argue. I have given it a proper thought... I'll speak to Bhaurao tomorrow itself.. It's not proper to stay here for long. Excuse me... He thinks he has taken a right decision. But what about consulting us? Neha.. I promise I'll be back in a day... Why are you not understanding? Please trust me... Just one day! Neha.. please... Mind your step... Hmm... If the mother is angry then the kid is also angry... If the mother is upset then the kid is also upset... Only if the mother is happy then the kid will also be happy... Let me tell your child a story... Hey little one... Are you excited to hear a story? Yes??? The baby is saying yes... - Is it? - yes Once upon a time in a small village, there was a big tree. The tree had lush-green leaves and sweet juicy fruits. That tree was really beautiful. On that tree, there was a crow with his family. They lived there happily. And then one day... A black poisonous snake wrapped itself around the tree. The snake's poison started spreading. The leaves started drying up. The fruits started rotting. The lush-green tree started turning blac The snake had his eyes set on the crow's nest. As soon as the crow's eggs hatched, the snake would gobble up the babies. The crow was very worried... But one day, a sparrow came to live on the tree... She also built a small nest for her fami And laid a small egg in the nest. The crow had an idea. The crow transferred his egg to the sparrow's nest And brought the sparrow's egg to his nest. As soon as the egg hatched, the snake gobbled up the baby.. But the crow's egg was safe in the sparrow's nest... The egg hatched into a beautiful baby crow. The crow lived happily ever after with his family. -Here - For me? - yes - No i can't take this. Am I not like your mother? Then please accept it... I wanted to ask you something... Who is more evil? The black crow or the black snake? Do wear this saree... ok? Thanks to you I did not feel the absence of a mother today... I am glad. Now you better spend some time with your husband. He has to leave early in the morning. Go on. - Move aside. I'll pack your bag. -Okay Thank you I just said 'Thank you' Are you still upset? I told you I'll be back in a day... Don't let me go like this. I'll be worried all the time. You don't need to worry at all. I did not want to be alone here... But in Tulsi's company, one day is manageable... Absolutely correct And listen... -Do not forget an important thing... -hmmm Your wife and your little one ... will be waiting here for you... of course... I will return soon for my son... How many times have i told you not to refer the baby as 'son'.. I am very sure that it will be a boy be it a girl or a boy, it'll be our baby... Isn't it beautiful enough? -Got it? - No... - Do you get me? - Not at all... -So you don't get me.. is it? - No Then go away... Listen... What are you doing here? I.... I was putting clothes to dry... let's go inside... it's too hot out here... come... come let's go... That woman you saw there... She is my daugher-in-law... My son Pratap's wife... Her name is Laxmi... A few years back... we thought we would be blessed with a baby in our family... Laxmi was pregnant back then... We were all very happy... I took good care of her... Gave her all the love in the world... In the eighth month of her pregnancy... She slipped and fell in the fields... She fell on her pregnant belly... It was an accident... a horrific accident... the belly had to be cut open to remove the dead baby... Laxmi was so devastated.. that she just stopped talking... She hasn't spoken a word till date... Our happiness got ruined... And what about your son? He... works in the city... He visits us once in a while... What's left for him here? There's nothing left for him here... Nothing at all... Please don't cry... Tushar and me are like your son and daughter-in-law.. Isn't it? Hmm? You are like a grandmother to our baby... Should I light the fire? Where's the firewood? Since when I had told Laxmi to get the firewood... but she doesn't listen... I don't know what she's upto the whole d She's become a burden on us... She's good for nothing... Where were you all this while? Stop staring and put it down... Can't you hear me? What are you staring at? Get out... get out and stay there... Wait ouside the door... I'll come in a bit... What is bothering you now? That cursed woman? Stop thinking about her... I am coming..You wait right there... You know how it is... a person has to accept his own fate...

And tonight I'll give you company here.. Don't you worry... Just keep an eye on this.. it's almost done... I'll be back in a bit... Laxmi...Tulsi left for home already... She has left already.. you naughty boy... Wait! Where are you going? Hey... What happened?... Hope you are fine... Yes... But the kids here are so naughty. Kids??

Many years back... Bhaurao's younger brother... His name was Kedarrao He got married to a girl... her name was Kaveri... But she turned out to be a witch... She stepped into our life and ruined our happiness... Not one or two.. but four I was a proud mother of four 'sons'... The eldest was Pratap and his three younger brothers... Kaveri cast a spell on my three younger They started behaving possessed... She spoke ill about me to my own childre My sons started staying away from me... They started roaming around with her all the time I didn't know how to get them back... Then she got pregnant... I heaved a sigh of relief i thought now she'll let go of my kids.. But I was wrong... Nothing of that sort happened... I took the matter up with her husband... I made him understand... He also tried to make her understand... But she did not listen to anyone... She was too stubborn... The two of them had a huge fight... The witch killed her own husband... we heard the man screaming and rushed at once... I asked her 'how could she kill such a nice man?' In reply she started abusing me... and then she did the unthinkable... She took the blood-stained knife .. and stabbed her pregnant belly with it.. We were shocked... When we tried to help her, she cut her throat... The witch died... but her evil spell still looms here... Even after she was gone, my kids did not change... They spoke of playing with her in the fields... One day when i woke up... there was an eerie silence all around... The witch drowned my three sons in the well... A few years later, my eldest son Pratap married Laxmi... And when she was eight months pregnant.. She started seeing the witch and my dead kids... Laxmi also came under her spell... She also stabbed her pregnant belly... She couldn't get pregnant anymore, I got my unhappy son married again.. not once but twice... Both the times, the witch killed the unborn babies... I took the challenge... Once again I got my son married But this time I sent him off to the city The village godman has shown us the way. If any pregnant woman... survives in this house for three days all by herself... without getting influenced by the witch. Then our family will be free of the evil And as fate would have it... Tushar and you came at the right time... Do you know the good news? My son Pratap's wife is also pregnant... She is safe in the city... If you manage to save your baby... from that witch... Then the spell will be broken forever... My family will get a heir... I will also become a grandmother... You are a mother... and so am I... I hope you understand that I am doing all this for my son... You stay here... and save your baby... and solve my problem... If you try to run away... My son Pratap will not spare you... take care of yourself... and remember one thing... The song that you heard... Do not sing that... Kaveri used to sing that song for my kids... She sings even today... I'll leave now... be careful... Tushar ! Tushar ! Tushar ! Tushar ! Tushar ! Tushar ! Tushar ! Everyone, Go and hide... I am coming to find you... Here I come!! Here I come!!

Are you out of your mind? She herself is carrying a 'girl'... But look at her audacity... She won't understand like that... Beat the hell out of her... High time I set her straight... -You bitch.... - No.Please don't.. No.. I'll not kill my girl... Tushar !! they are after our baby.... But I'll not let anything happen to our baby..

I will not kill my baby... I will not kill my baby... Neha.. Are you okay? These guys set me free just now... The last three days have been miserable for me... But now that I have seen you and our baby, I feel relieved... Hey Neha... What happened? What's wrong with you? Careful... What happened? That day you had told me a story.. Today I'll tell you one... The only difference is that... Your story was incomplete... Mine is complete... Your story was a lie... Mine is the truth... Neha...What story? What is going on? These people burned a woman alive in her eighth month... No, What you are saying is wrong... Wrong?? It's your traditions that are wrong... which enslaves women... Baby girls are sacrificed for better harvest... which you did Nonsense!! You won't understand our tradition and Culture.. We have survived due to the roots of our traditions.. It is said that a woman's worst enemy is another woman... Women like you can kill young girls for your own survival... hey girl. it's not killing thats our tradition we have to do this sacrifice for God's sake we have to sacrifice life Sacrifice !? yes "Sacrifice!?" Words like these don't suit you -Stop it right there... -Why? You want to silence me as well? The same way you silenced Kaveri and the other women... You burned Kaveri alive... She tried her best to save her baby till end but in those three days no one bothered to see her She died.... But her story is still alive... The echoes of her story... were heard by every pregnant woman.. who stepped in this house... but no-one understood her pain... which story? what pain? hmm... and what's our fault ? She killed my brother... How could we spare her? That's true..I saw her killing Kedarrao with my own eyes... Sometimes what we see can be an illusion too... illusion ? Kaveri showed me her true story through illusions in these three days.. because of your behaviour you spoiled my status in village you have not even follwed our old tradit i just want to save my girl child... you have crossed all limits i wont spare you today hey kids, watch this. whoever will go against our family traditions will suffer like this I can't bear your antics anymore... I get insulted by my elders I See ! you want to kill me? Go ahead.. don't kill my daughter don't kill her I will not spare you now, I will kill you Leave me Run, go away oh, God you witch, what did you do? you killed your own husband i didn't do it why should i believe you? i saw it with own eyes i didn't do anything please believe me hey listen.... she killed her husband she killed her husband because of your wrong story, you killed Kaveri She also murdered my three kids... What about that? She also killed the pregnant women.. What about that? That's not true... You are lying... She didn't allow your future generation to live... She did not want you to poison their young minds... with your evil thoughts and traditions.. One more thing... She did not kill the pregnant women, you killed them... Had I not understood Kaveri 's story even I would have been killed Kaveri don't do this, Kaveri I know no-one has understood your pain and sacrifice... but i have understood the truth.. I'll tell the world your true story... Kaveri, don't kill my baby don't kill my baby If my baby gets killed, then once again a mother will suffer inj And only you can understand a mother's pain... please don't kill my baby Help me save my baby... Kaveri, I promise you that the culprits will be brought to justice. Please help me and my baby please spare my baby kaveri... help me for the sake of all mothers... I am not afraid of you all.. you all are worse than animals... keep your mouth shut don't act smart women should mind their limits don't forget, a woman is also a mother Listen... Forget the past... After these three days... my house, my family is free of the dark spell... you stay here with us... We'll all live happily together... Let our legacy grow... if you do not do as I say... then I will... will have to kill you Killing is your only talent.. Laxmi survived because she lacked courage to raise her voice... but i will not remain silent what happened? You are not used to a woman saying such things, right? what wil you do now? you will tell your son to kill me... Am I right? What say, Tushar? Tushar!!! Now you have crossed the line.. Dare you come closer ! I could have left from here yesterday itself... but I wanted to put an end to what you had started.. And most importantly, Tushar ...Sorry, Pratap.. I wish you were man enough to do what was right... I will give birth to this baby... and ensure that it's nothing like you... hey girl... you can't leave... - Laxmi, what have you done?
