What kind of drums do you play? - Imperial County Percussion. - What the fuck is that, some three month old company? Ah, just kidding, man. I've heard of them. Reinventing the wheel, nothing wrong with that. - Yeah, thanks man. Wow. - Right? Oh, is that the new one? Supposed to be like best ever. - Oh yeah dude, it's pretty solid, smooth. I dig it, man. Why do you play or something? - A little bit. Hey, you're in the Xenos, huh? - Yeah. - That's who I came to see. - No, shit. - I love you guys. - Thanks man. - Yeah. - Pleasure to meet you. - You too. I got some more shit I gotta take care of. I'll catch you later, man. - Hey guys, I'm Freddie. - Hey. - Hi, I'm Ronnie. - Hey Ronnie. I love this band. - Hey, I'm Sally. - Thank you. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too, Sally. - Thanks for coming out. - Yeah, you too. I love Polymorphs. I know who you are. You're like my favorite singer of all time probably. I love your guys' band, it's like an all-star band. I asked all my friends to come out but my friends are so flaky, y'know? So we'll see I even know your old band, dude. Ex-gods right? - This guy even knows even who Ex-gods are. - That's crazy. - Hey, at least you're here. I'll get you a drink ticket when we get some. - Oh, fuck that. I'll buy you guys a round What are you guys drinking? - We don't drink before shows. - What? But it's the first night of tour come on. - Tomorrow's the second followed by the third, We don't drink before shows. - We don't drink before shows 'cause you can't handle your booze. - Whoa. - Bitch you can't handle your fucking mouth. I'll gladly shut it for you, Goldie. - Whoa, trouble in paradise, huh? What is up with that? - That usually goes away on tour, huh? Or does it all get way more annoying? What do you think Goldie? - Hey man, y'know, thanks for the help earlier, but don't fucking call me Goldie, dick. - Wow, those guys really don't get along, huh? - Right now I gotta go handle these guys. - Hi. - Hey. - Got any cold Mexican beer? - Sure do, got any drink tickets for me? - I usually just give them to the band, places like this don't really help out the roadie/merch dude. - Oh, well darling, this kind of place takes care of our roadie merch dudes, besides I'm on the wagon tonight, so you can have my shift drink. - Oh, thank you. Hey, uh, you know this guy? - Yeah, Freddie? Of course he's played in like a million local bands. Shredding drummer, weird dude. - Besides being weird, 'sup with that fan stuff? - Yeah, definitely fan stuff for sure. On top of super fan, he's got some serious rage issues. Plus he's one of those like intense talks really close to your face all the time guys. Okay, so the worst thing I heard about him, the last band he was in, either broke up or he got kicked out, 'cause he lost his shit on stage, broke a dude's arm, sent him to the ER, ambulances were here like bad shit. - What, like some unruly fan or something? - No, that's the best part, it was the bass player in his own band. I know dude, and that poor guy won't even set foot in here now. - Fuck, were you here to see that? - No, I missed all of it. I wasn't working that night, but me personally, I've seen him just go off on people like over nothing. I have to say though, he really fucking shreds on drums. To me, that's worth something. - Not if you're a creep. - I don't know, he's not a creep, he's just weird. I don't know, he's got a bad rep. Deservedly so, kind of an asshole but he's always been super cool to me. Plus he's walking up right now, so enjoy darling. - Pretty quiet over here. Talking about me? - Listen, you guys, we have to put this shit away and concentrate on having a really good show. This tour is either gonna be amazing, or the last time I ever hit the road. Look, even if there's only 10 people here tonight, I wanna give them a show they won't forget. So that by the end of tour, we've got half full houses, at least. So let's put this away, like the professionals we are. And kick some ass tonight. ♪ -But I would give ♪ ♪ anything to be ♪ ♪ what has become of me? ♪ ♪ I'm stuck in darkness ♪ ♪ like tar inside a pit ♪ ♪ But I would give ♪ ♪ anything to be ♪ ♪ Why won't the stars ♪ ♪ Why won't they shine on me? ♪ Thank you. ♪ I receive kisses ♪ - Hey dude. - Hey, how's it going? - Good, was a good set. Did you guys finally get drink tickets? - We did. - Wanna trade one of those in for something. - Have a Mexican beer, please. - I can do that for ya. Do you take lime with your Mexican beer? - Nope. - Well, hey, thanks for being easy. - So, I've been told. Cheers. - Thanks. - Hey, good set, bud. - Oh, hey. I love your riffs. Hey, would you sign that for me? - Oh, yeah, it was interesting. - Yeah, first night of tour, what are you gonna do? - Hopefully forget about it. - That's the thing, I'm a pretty straight up guy. So I'm gonna say something here. You guys need a better drummer. That guy like a, close personal friend, related to somebody? I mean dropping sticks, missing snare hits. You guys could do way better. - That is straightforward. - That's me. - And well, he's an old school friend. He's all right. And you know it's first night of tour, he'll be okay. - Okay, but, okay for what? You wanna just have a couple of cool stories, you know? Maybe he's gonna be okay. You wanna sell out some of these clubs instead of perpetually playing for 25 people? You guys gonna have to upgrade. - Well, I mean, even if we wanted to, finding a drummer at the drop of a hat on tour, just doesn't seem very likely. But, you never know. Anyway, where are you guys staying tonight? - Well, considering what we made at the door, we didn't have money for a hotel, so, at this point, I have no idea. - Well, you're in luck, you can stay with me. I even have a music room in my backyard I built myself. We can all hang out. - That sounds cool. Let me talk with the others outside. - All right, let me know. - Thanks, man. - Hey, Lita, can I get a beer please? - You got it, Freddie. - Thank you. - I really think we should get a fucking motel. - No, not tonight. We have money to get to the next gig. That's not motel money. - I can front the band and the band can just pay me back. - That is a shitty economic policy for a band on tour. Number one, nobody knows who the fuck we are, even if they know who some of us are, and two, we can't just go staying in motels every time you feel uncomfortable. - Did you meet that guy? That guy is fucking freaking me the fuck out. Did you hear what the bartender said about him? - No. - He beat the shit out of his own fucking band member. - Oh, come on. - Who does that? - He's not in your band. So what are you fucking crying about? Besides, there'd be someone who knows how to- - Come on, you guys break it up. All right, look, it's true, we don't have a lot of money, so we can't borrow it from you if we have a place to stay. I mean, I'm with Brenda. I don't feel threatened by this guy. So if you do, you can sleep in the van. - Maybe I will then. - But, I think everybody else feels the same way. I'm going to take him up on his offer. - Yeah, me too. - Fine. - So, I mean, look, we need to get on the same page a little bit more, but hey, let's concentrate on the things we can control. Like making sure tomorrow night is better than tonight, onstage and off. - Sounds good. - Guys decide? - Yeah, you're gonna take us to your house. Really? Cool. - You're gonna love it, especially you. - You know what this reminds me of? That one time when X-Gods and Polymorphs were on tour, that show fell through. Those kids were so bummed out, we weren't Christian hardcore. - What was the name of that guy? - Jeff Rocker. - Yeah. - How could you forget that? - Anyways, we could go back to Jeff's place to play. Man it was ape shit. We played on top of the ramp, while we were playing, these kids were on skateboards and bikes flying everywhere. Man, then he scratched up 400 bucks for the band and we sold out of merch. - Yeah, Jeff Rocker was one hell of a man. - Wow, that's cool. Hey, you know what else would be cool? You guys should play a song. Oh, Oh, play "This Isn't Anywhere". And you can play that drum part you're fucked up, and give yourself some confidence for the rest of the tour. - No man, that's not gonna happen. - Come on, you guys. - Hell no, dude, that's not gonna fucking happen. - Here's what you do. Here, take that. - Break it up into three parts, you know. Don't make it too complicated for yourself like this. Then you put it all together, like, - Holy shit. - You know what dude? Fuck you. Fuck this, I'm out. - Now, what the fuck is that guy's problem? - Christ. - Morning, fuck. - Hey, good morning. Hey morning. - How'd you sleep? - Pretty good, thanks. ♪ So cold the way you left me to die ♪ ♪ But the pain would not subside ♪ ♪ So when I got back on my feet ♪ ♪ Cleared away the tears from my eyes ♪ ♪ You're the one who's left ♪ ♪ Left to die ♪ ♪ Oh you engineered my demise ♪ ♪ But then I deciphered your lies ♪ ♪ And now I leave you in the dust ♪ ♪ Echoing your less than sad goodbyes ♪ ♪ You're the one who's left ♪ ♪ Left to die ♪ ♪ So cold the way you left me to die ♪ ♪ But the pain would not subside ♪ ♪ So when I got back on my feet ♪ ♪ Cleared away the tears from my eyes ♪ ♪ You're the one who's left ♪ ♪ Left to die ♪ - Thanks, we have merch over there... - Help you out dude. - Hey, that's not how I like it, all right. - That was way better tonight my man. - Are you fucking kidding me?

I was a dick, I'm sorry. - Boys playing nice? - Just fine, thanks. - Hey guys, oh, you're on fire tonight, girl. Insane energy. - Hey thanks, great drumming last night. - Sorry about that. Hey, can I get you guys a drink? Can I get you a drink man? - Yeah. - We have drink tickets, plus you let us stay at your house, come on, what are you doing here anyway? - Unexpectedly had the night off work, so I made the trip. I only live a couple hours from here. - That's so sweet, come on, let me buy you a drink. - No way. You're on tour, lemme buy you a drink, what are you drinking? - Vodka, soda. - Ketel okay? - Fuck yeah, glad you're here. - Let's do some shots of tequila and Mexican beers? - Actually, I'll have a Ketel soda too, please, thanks. - 'Sup bud? We'll have four shots of tequila two Tecates and two Ketel sodas, thank you. - Excuse me, while I go take a piss. - I gotta go too, here leave fat tip for that guy. - Ketel soda. You fucking pansy. You can't drink and you can't drum. What the fuck are you doing on the road? You ever ask yourself that? Clearly not cut out for this shit. - Fuck's the matter with you? Outta your fucking mind? don't make me kick your ass in this fucking bathroom. - In your wettest fucking dreams you couldn't kick my ass bitch. Now smile, go wash your hands and let's go do some shots. Maybe I'll punch in the eye later when you least expect it, like funny stuff. - Fuck you, dick. - That dude is pretty fucking sensitive, huh? - You have no idea, let's drink. - Cheers. - Thanks for the shots. It's nice to see a familiar face on the road. - Yeah, old pals now, huh? - Old enough. - Hey, can I ask you a question? - You mean, besides of that one? - Yeah, hey what'd you mean when you said at least there'd be someone who could defend a woman in the group? - Yeah, that, I don't know, we played a first show a few months ago, jack ass they're being all grabby with me and Duane saw the whole thing and didn't do a fucking thing to stop it. No, luckily there was a bouncer there kicked the guy out but by then it was too late, he already grabbed me. - What the fuck did Duane have to say for himself? - Not a fucking thing, he just froze. Security guard even called him out on it for not doing anything. Duane's excuse was, "Oh, well the security guard, just got there before I did, but I was just about to." Sorry, excuse for a man and a drummer, but you didn't hear it from me. I'm not paying for a fucking practice space. - Tour goes well enough, you might not have to. - Yeah, but that's the thing, it's not gonna fuckin' happen with Duane at the helm. - Hey, nice show. - Yeah, nice tits and ass too mommy, fucking hot. - For fucks sake, see what girls have to deal with? - Fucking animals. - Yeah its all right. - Whoops, gotta go. - Thanks for the shots. - God damn it. - What the fuck you fucking dick. - You should learn how to talk to a lady my friend. - Fuck you get the fuck away from me you freak. - Call for help you fucking pussy. - I don't need help. -Yeah you do. -Fuck you. Guys ready to apologize to the lady? - Fuck her. And fuck you too. - Damn Hollister, you finally don't have to wear your uni. And what do you do? Come dressed head to toe in blue anyway, a real company, man huh? - Baby steps Monroe. I don't wanna look so good you start crying from jealousy other than the obvious job jealousy, of course. Are you having any luck with-well, anything? - Working with Willie Mack? You know what they say: watch your back when you're working with Willie Mack. Now Turo is dead, 'cause of him. - I watch my back every second of every day especially when I'm around you swinging dicks. - Pretty good rule of thumb. I'll catch you fuckos later. Maybe hit the buffet. Pow - Yeah, I'll keep you posted as soon as I find out. Yes, thank you, sir. Welcome to homicide Hollister. It's like we're off to a quick start. - Thank you, Kathy, I'm ready to learn. - That's the spirit Hollister. Don't call me Kathy on the job, even though I've known you since you were three, I don't need Monroe and his cronies acting any stupider than they already are. - Yes,sir. Lieutenant, sir, of course. - We're good. Detective Mack, how are you holding up? Ready to get back at it with a new partner? - Right as rain lieutenant, still feel bad about Turo though. - Turo was bent, Detective. That is a fact. - I should have done more to stop it. - Sounds like you're not ready Detective Mack, you don't look like you're ready. I need you to be on point with this, Detective Mack. So you tell me; are you ready for a new partner and a new case or do I go in a different direction? - Hollister will have nothing to fear under my wing. - Atta boy Detective Mack. - Can you double check the emails to see what time we're supposed to load in? - Yeah door says six, but no one's there. - Okay. - Christ, look who it is. Look who the fuck it is. - Hey guys. - Hey nice shirt. - Thanks, made it myself. - What are you doing here? - House sitting for my uncle he likes me to water his plants and talk to 'em and stuff. One of those kind of guys but he just lives like three blocks over that way. - Three shows in a row, not bad. You super fan or something? - That's me. Hey, where's the guy that's working here? Or girl? - Hey, sorry, my car broke down a few blocks away. - Oh, bummer - Let me get you in there. - Hey, I wanna talk to you about something. I know what you did yesterday to those guys, they deserve it they were assholes. So I wanted to say thank you. - I don't know what you're talking about. 'Cause I don't wanna go to jail, but you're very welcome and yeah, they were huge fucking assholes. - How's it going? - Pretty good. Can I have water please? - Yeah, we don't have any ice yet, that all right? - Yeah, it's fine. Did we have any pre-sales for the show? - Last time it checked around 3:30, it was like six. - 60? - No, six. Can I get you something to drink? - Yeah, it would be great. Can I get a double shot of tequila? - Yeah, coming right up. - Thanks. He's with us is that all right? - Thank you. - Hey? - I thought you didn't drink before shows. - Only sold six tickets. So I said, fuck it, want a drink? - Why don't I take half yours? You never know who's gonna be there. Even with six people. Could be 'the show'. - People don't give a shit. - That'd make me nobody and I know I'm somebody 'cause God don't make no junk. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Never saw that little kid all snot nosed and dirty with a slingshot, like a poster on the school nurse's office or something. - Oh like the kitten on a clothes line? - Hang in there, exactly. This band is awesome. - Yeah, but the drummer is terrible. - He's getting way better. - You think? - Fuck no, you need me. ♪ As I work this wheel ♪ ♪ Evolving over time ♪ ♪ As wrinkles grow I feel ♪ ♪ The thirst within my mind ♪ - Thanks. ♪ Fine. we'll go it alone ♪ - Best yet. Better every night. - Shut up, homie fucked it up again. - Oh it wasn't that bad. - Come on really? - Eh, pretty bad. You know, in my opinion, he's not someone that's gonna get a whole lot better. I mean, I don't understand why you guys play with him at all. He sounded okay on the record and then you get them on stage and he falls apart. The fuck is up with that? - It's funny actually with the album it's like pulling teeth and ultimately I wound up having to play drums on a lot of it. The stuff we couldn't fix in pro tools. I'm not sure why I'm telling you all this. - 'Cause we're pals, you play drums? - Not at all and that's my point. I mean, I really thought that he'd get better and it's not like the songs are like insanely complicated or anything. - Why then? - Well, putting this band together was his idea. all of us played in bands in the past, back home and he kind of sold us on that line that like, we find that glory that eluded us the first time around. And yeah, it's just like, I don't know, it's kind of bittersweet irony, maybe? Whatever. The other thing is he has this really awesome rehearsal space in his backyard. And you know, it's not just like a converted garage. It's like an actual free standing killer, fully functioning awesome recording studio with really good equipment. That shit on stage, that guitar and that amp that's his. Mine is like crap compared to that. So, you know, we started putting the songs together all that became part of the whole thing. So as you can see we're pretty bound to this guy. - I knew it, it had to be something like that which, I mean, is totally understandable, but still if you're gonna make 'the jump', you're not doing it with that guy. - What 'jump'? There ain't no money making music. - Not with that attitude. Look, I know it's hard but if you have all the right ingredients you can get that elusive slice and you guys have almost all the right ingredients. You just need a way better spoon to stir that shit up with. Hey, we can talk more about it at my uncle's house If you want to. ♪ Eye sore, Eye Sore ♪ - Let me go see what the others think. ♪ Eyesore eyesore ♪ - What the fuck are you doing here dude? Fuck off. - You know the names of all the little doodads and shit but you're in way over your head. Having mommy pay for a studio in the backyard only gets you so far when you have to try to carry the band, huh? - Dude you don't fucking know me, all right? You're just fucking little bitch, fuck off. - You're crushing your friend's dreams 'cause you wanna share them. You know that? You've gotta be the most pathetic person alive; bringing everybody down 'cause you can't cut it and you can't admit it. So ask yourself, who's the bitch? - Looks like we made it to my house, asswipe. Good job following the GPS. I don't need your fucking help. Leave me alone you fucking pervert. Fucking asshole, don't try any of that rapey shit. Fucking asshole. - Hold on. - I got your name, Mr. - Keys lady. - Just get out of here. Just fuck you. - Goodnight. Fuck off. - The fuck is this, when did this happen? Dude, seriously? - Holy shit, what the fuck? - Now, we just got word of a body found buried in a flower bed out in Sherman Heights. You have the address I just texted it to you. Let's see what this is all about. Keep me posted. - Were the flowerbeds intact when they left? - I don't know, you tell me when you find out. Yes. - Yeah, 10-4 lieutenant. - Thank you. - Pretty smooth, Detective. - Thank you, sir. - Sarcasm. - Of course, sir. - Here's the first lesson, if you haven't learned anything yet. Think before you speak to the Lieutenant she does not like bullshit and neither do I. - Look we took care of all the things we could take care of. Maybe this wasn't meant to be but we gotta finish the tour. I mean, what's the first rule of show business? The show must go on. We said we'd do these shows. We should. We have to. Doesn't matter if it's three people, after we're home, we can talk or not. But we should give it our best shot. - Or our second best. - You know what, fuck you, you miserable bitch. There wouldn't be a band without me and you guys all fucking know it. You're an inconsiderate fucking whore is what you are. - Look if I'm gonna be honest we're barely a band with you, because of you. - Whoa, you guys. Take it easy, this bullshit. - Please. Stop. Please. - Do you wanna tell him how good he is? Go ahead, give him a compliment. Tell him how good he is. Tell him how good his drumming is. Go ahead, anyone? - See ya. - What the fuck was that? - The fucking truth. fuck. - Good morning. - Dude. - Sorry, man. - Hey cool. - You all right? - Guys. - I'm calling him. Hey Duane, it's me. Please call me when you get this. Hopefully you're not on a plane already and we can talk. Please? Love you, bye. Straight to voicemail, maybe his phone is off. Maybe he's on a plane already. - Fuck, what are we gonna do now, just drive back home? - No, this sucks but we have a way out, which is the first rule of show business? - Oh, you mean the guy you hooked up with, that we barely know? - Give me a fucking break. We know him well enough to stay at his house. Besides, maybe we hooked up, maybe we didn't why do you give a shit? - You're right, none of my business. - Dude does rip on drums though. Just saying, blessing in disguise. - How can you say that? I mean, we wouldn't be a band if it wasn't for him, it was concept, his equipment. He called all of us I mean, he did the flyers. He booked the shows, all the stuff we didn't wanna do. I mean, we have name recognition, but he did all the work. - Then he should have stayed booking shows or been an agent or something. But no, we had to drum and be in the band, be in the spotlight. I'm with Gil, I think it happened for a reason, right now we have an opportunity and I think we should take advantage of that. Play with someone who actually knows how to play the drums. You know that guy over there. - Hey Freddy, what are you doing for the next couple of weeks? - No concrete plans why? - What about your job? - Fuck my crappy job, why? What's going on you guys? - Looks like our drummer hit the road back home. How many of those Xenos songs do you know? - You only have nine that you play on stage, right? I know all those. - Well there's actually 11. There's two that Dwayne couldn't pull off live. So we stripped those from the set but I could teach you those right away. - Wow, those are my favorite ones. Shit looks like I'm going on tour with Xenos then. ♪ This cold, blue, violence ♪ ♪ That you know, it's so hard for me to swallow ♪ ♪ Is it me, is this what you came to see ♪ ♪ Because it makes no sense ♪ This cold, blue ♪ Is it me, is this what you came to see ♪ ♪ Cause it makes no sense this cold blue violence ♪ ♪ Cold blue violence ♪ - Thank you. - We're home.

Hi Patricia. - Come on, dude. - What? - Mom? - Yeah. - Lyla's got something in her mouth. - Eew, Lyla's got something disgusting. - What is it? - I think it's part of someone's head, and an ear. - Lyla drop it, kids get back in the house. - But I wanna play outside mom. - Get in the goddamn house right now Johnny. - 911 what's the nature of your emergency? - I'd like to report a murder-an assault. - Ma'am let's start slow, what exactly are you looking at? - My dog has, uh, scalp in it's mouth. - Okay, is that everything? - No, it's attached to something, it's attached to like a human ear or it's part of something big, like a head it's got some bone and skull on the other side of it. It's a bit-skin, I don't-like a human ear. - Ma'am is it still in the dog's mouth? - I'm working on that. I got most of it. Dog got the ear. - Ma'am what's your address? - 1818 Edgemont. - Officers will be there in about two minutes. Can you save some of the skin from the dog for me? - Yes. - We'll have some crime scene techs out there as well. - Yes, of course. - Thanks Ma'am, would you like me to stay on the line until officers arrive? - No, that's fine we just got back from vacation. - I'm sorry, Ma'am. - Me too. ♪ Every time I close my eyes I think of you ♪ - Come on back guys, I'll show you what we've got. - Who was first on the scene? - I was, Sir. Hello, I'm officer Blum. - Jerry it's me Frieda. - Wow, crazy how different you look outside of uniform. - All right. What do we got Jerry? - Well, sir, the dog dug up the ear right over there. See the lady of the house called 911, said the kids were playing in the yard and the dog started acting kind of funny. Next thing you know, up pops the ear she had to pull it away from the dog. So did get a bit damaged, Kate has it. Looks like we got something here detectives. - Kate Wolf, nice to meet you detectives. Here's the victim male, 40 to 45 years old, heavily tattooed brown, brown, five seven, buck 70, no ID, no cell, evidence of severe blunt force trauma to the head, skull caved in, large piece of scalp missing including the right ear, chewed by a dog and recovered. - So we're gonna have to wait on who this guy is? - I'm afraid so for a few hours, at least, and that's if he's in the system. - How do you wanna play this, Willie? - I don't know officer Blum. But I happened to notice something red and shiny out on the walkway. You might wanna go check that out. - Yes, sir, detective Mack, sir. - Something talking to you, Hollister? - This tattoo, it's a band logo like underground rock band. Pretty obscure one too. - There's gotta be thousands of people with those how can you tell? - Not really, what's a rattlesnake doing on an anchor, a desert creature on a device for water? It's from a band called C-snakes. My brother loves that kind of stuff. Anyway, if I'm right about this, we should go check out the music clubs in town, where they put on these kinds of shows, narrow down our pool pretty quick. If it's somebody from a small scene as opposed to just some random scraggly 40 year old. - Alright, Hollister sounds good to me. Let's take some pictures and check them out. - All right, I have several, I got your contact number from the loo.

This is detective Hollister. - Hi Gwen, sorry for all this. - That's okay, more excitement than we usually get around here. - Gwennie please. - It's okay, Mrs. Waite, Gwen, why don't we go in the kitchen and talk while your parents talk with Detective Mack. ♪ And reflecting in your eye ♪ I see you like the C-snakes. - Yeah, they're like my favorite band right now. Even though they've been broken up for awhile my girlfriend got me into them. Apparently the guitarist is in a new band with some other rockers from back in the day they played in town at Chubaluba's last night. I wanted to come back for the show but it didn't fit in with my vacation plans. That's who you're looking at. Xenos. - Xenos, that's the new band name? - Yeah, with an X. - Gwen, tell me, do you use social media? - I'm 14 years old, I use the shit out of it. - Yeah, I figured. What's your favorite? Yourface? - Christ no, that's for seventy year old family members and political whack jobs. There's a new indie artist fueled one called Maidenhouse. - Maidenhouse. - Let me get you there. - So is that the drummer from C-snakes? - No, nobody knows what that guy's doing in the band or was doing in the band. - Wait, what do you mean was? - Well, a couple of nights ago pictures were showing the old drummer and people were saying, that shows are unremarkable and even kind of bad. But after the show they played last night they have this new guy behind the kit and people are saying two things. The new drummer is the shit and Xenos they're the best new band in a long time. - Just based on switching drummers? - Apparently this guy is that good. - What's this? - Oh, that's nothing. I'm gonna kill you, Johnny. - I think I know how somebody found out about this place and I have a pretty good idea of who that is in the backyard. All right, thanks for your time. - Fucking epic. - Hey man. - How you doing man? - Good, hey do you think we could use your bathroom? - Yeah, no problem. - Oh, cool. - It's a dog day afternoon here in San Diego. As a family came home and made a shocking discovery. It was at this house that the Waite family returned from vacation only to discover a dead body on the premises. It was as the children played in the yard that the family dog discovered the body as far as I-yup, correct. The body has not been identified as of yet. Police are asking that anybody with information on the case to please contact them. I'm Elsa Hunter Channel 6 News. Back to studio. - So what were the kids yelling about? - If my hunch is correct, body is a former drummer of a band on tour called Xenos. Needs proving though. - Damn Hollister, you're pretty fucking good. - Just lucky, Detective Mack. - Yeah, right. - Patricia Connell, can we have a word please? - Yeah. - Do you mind turning that off? - Thanks. - Hi, I'm Detective Hollister and this is my partner Detective Mack. - Hi. - We'd like to ask you a few questions if you don't mind. - Sure, you guys do you need something to drink? - Do you have coffee? - No. - That's all right, Ms. Connell, we're fine. - Well, yes you are. - Now Mrs. Connell, did you notice anything last night that was unusual? In particular, anything that happened at the Waite's house across the street over there? - Last night, I took a cab. - And what time was that? - Let's see, I was at the bar it was dark. The bartender called last call. So it had to be around two. And then I took a cab, cab was pretty quick. And then I think I fell down, cab driver had to help me up here and I think I yelled at him. And then I think I just went to sleep so I didn't notice anything. - That's it? - Yep, I think that's it. - That's fine, Mrs. Connell. Here's my card if you remember anything else no matter how insignificant, please don't hesitate to give us a call. - Oh, I won't hesitate. - What are you doing? Come on, get your camera let's go David. Mack! Detective Mack is there any information you can share with us? - Hey Elsa, the police have no comment at this time. We're gonna be issuing a complete statement when we have the adequate information. So if you'll excuse us, we need to get back to the station and try and solve this thing. - Listen, I'm hearing reports about a dog. Anything you can share about that at all? - Not at this time I'm sorry. - Come on Willie give me something, anything? - Sorry. - All right thank you. - How is it going dude? - Hey, what's up, what's going on? - Not much, can I talk to you a sec? - Sure, what's up? - If anyone shows up, give me a sign we gotta stop talking. All right? - Okay. Coast is clear. Give it to me. - All right. I'm starting to think Duane didn't go home after all. - Really? - Yeah. I tried calling and texting. He doesn't write me back. Just got on phone with his mom and she hasn't heard from him in two days. Every time she calls his phone its out of juice. - Maybe he went somewhere else. I mean, he has money. He does whatever he wants. Shit he hooked up with you guys, wants to be a rocker? - He basically put this band together as more like it. It's fucked up little fantasy but whatever, there's worse, but that's not it. When we were at the mini-mart earlier I was watching the news and there was this house that looked exactly like the house we stayed at a few nights ago and they found a fucking body there. This family, I don't know, they came home from vacation and they found a body. - Are you sure it was the same house? - I'm pretty positive, I remember there being this seashell on the front door and I saw it. And then when I was watching the news she was standing right next to the house that had the same Seashell. - We gotta call the cops. We're gonna call the cops, right? - I don't know if Freddy did it. - What if he's a fucking murderer? - But what if he's not? I really feel something is happening with this tour. We sound way better than we did when Duane was in the band shows have a ton of energy and people are showing up and you know. - Shit. Dreams die hard. - Especially resurrected ones. - Have you told anyone else? - Fuck no. - Have you checked the news or anything? - Haven't had time. - Check this out, let's see here. Okay, San Diego. - Hey, what's going on? - Oh, hey dude what's up? - Hey. - I can't make anything out of this shit right now. It's all- I'll check later. Let's not jump the gun all right? Let's take it easy. I mean, maybe it's not Duane and pure coincidence, y'know? But the guy is fucking weird. - Agreed, just see what happens. Just wait till they identify the body and we'll go from there. - Okay.

More, more, more. - So what do you have for me? - Not sure the ID yet, white male, 40s killed roughly 24 hours ago they say. Hollister has some good intel I believe. - What's that Hollister? - Could be a touring band. Drummer. Underground, small time. Apparently their band is still on the road right now. Played here a couple nights ago. Fits the timeline. - Okay. - They got a new drummer. They didn't miss a gig. I just have to go to my office and crosscheck a couple of things. - Detective Mack, let's go hit up the ME. - Let's do it. - Can you please keep an eye on that? - Sure. - Thanks so much. - What the fuck dude, get the fuck out of here? - Hey, what the fuck? - That guy just puked next to me right there. - Come on man lets take him out. Come on motherfucker, come on. - Fuck you, you dirty pussy. - Wins fights though. Don't want to fuck up my hands. - Shit man, I can't wait to tell everybody about this. - We're not saying a shit to anybody. - Okay. - Let's go. - Hold up. - Holy shit, Freddy you're awesome. - Thanks. - This guy said we can stay at his house. - Whoa. - Yeah, I'll drive. - I'll bring the car around. - This is going pretty fucking well, huh? Fuck yeah it is. - I'm dumbfounded. - I told you guys. - Yeah. - I told you. - So ladies, what do we have? - Well, I know what he ate and I know how he died but we don't know who he was yet. - No DNA results yet? I heard those new machines were fast. - Like a rocket, sir. But there are no hits in the system. I guess our guy never gave a sample. - So how did he die? - Blunt force trauma, 13 hits, maybe 10 post-mortem. Overkill, which I don't have to tell you is almost always someone known to the victim. - So I've heard. - Well, it looks like the rookie's got the best lead, sir. - Let's see what she's got, thank you. - Sorry, we weren't more successful. - The way of the world. ♪ Oh, you know its not not mutual, oh ♪ - 911 what's your emergency? - I remembered something. - Ma'am is this an emergency? - Well, I certainly think so. - Have you been drinking Ms-? - Connell, only a little. I remembered something from the murder. I need to speak with Detective Mack - Detective Mack, isn't in the office right now. Would you like me to put you through to homicide? - Well, can't you just give me his number? I had it and I lost it. - I'm sorry Ma'am, I can let him know you called or I can put you through to homicide. - All right, put me through. - Homicide. Yes. You don't say. Well that's very helpful. Yes, that's very good information. Can I get your number so that I can give it to Detective Mack, if he has more questions? Connell, you say? Well, I'll be sure to pass this on to Detective Mack. Thank you, Ms Connell. Thanks babe, I owe you one. - Get the fuck outta here, you're gonna get us busted. - You didn't say nothing, babe. And besides, it's probably some drunk broad wants to get her name in the news anyway, Willie Mack will thank me. - You need to leave now. - Oh, come on, no time for a quickie? - Get out of here. - Sorry. - The fuck, man? - Fuck's up with you, bitch? Litterbug motherfucker. - Asshole. - Let's go get the fuck out of here. - Dude, get in the van! Come on. - What do you have Hollister? - We really gotta check out this band Xenos ASAP, specifically the drummer, Freddie Proehl. - I'd say you're right, Hollister. I take it you've researched their next show? - Yes, sir. - Drive or fly? - Six hour drive, Rock City. - Fly then. Book it. - Done. - Nice work Hollister. - Somebody doesn't like you. - Yeah, well those fuckers can get in line. What's up with my car, man? - Somebody put sugary stuff in your gas. Soda or something. I'm gonna have to empty it and clean it and then hope someone didn't mess it up too bad. - Well, when's it gonna be done? - I should have it by tomorrow. - I got things to do, man. I got a meeting. Make it today. - No, tomorrow. - Well, you got a loner or something?

What the drunk lady said on the phone. - The fuck, right now? - Don't play with me, you know it turns me on. You know. - Yeah, I know, you fucking weirdo. Well, this is the mush brained memory of an old alkie lady. So I don't know how hot it's gonna make you but I'll try and pick up the slack. - Okay. - The information that lady wanted me to pass on to Willie Mack was that she remembers something, Something from the night of the murder, across the street from her place. Says she was passed out on the porch with the lights out. She said, no one could see her. And she had a pretty good view, says there was a disturbance from the van parked across the street. The one with a cracked taillight. Says a man stumbled around the side of the van with dark hair. She says he was soon followed by two other people. One a bald man, and the other was a girl with blue hair. Said they confronted the man and beat him over and over again. She says bald man dragged the body around the back. She says, she passed out she wasn't sure what she saw. She thought she was dreaming until she saw some viral video on the news. And she recognized the van and the people inside of it. - Holy shit, didn't those detectives just fly out to Rock City. They arrested the guy with the short hair. The one that was outside the van in that video. - Yeah, Willie Mack, that bitch that stole my job. - So you're not gonna tell 'em? - Fuck no, let those goodie-two-shoe motherfuckers figure out for themselves too late or not at all. What the fuck do I care? Come here. - They're gonna get away with murder. - Maybe. - God I'm so horny. - That's my girl. ♪ Lithe fingers cloaked in shadow, ♪ ♪ Spin darkness into dreams ♪ ♪ So when the field lays follow ♪ ♪ All is not what it seems ♪ ♪ What dreams to spin the girls asks ♪ ♪ The crone just smiles and nods ♪ ♪ Best not to tell the children ♪ ♪ The yearnings of the gods ♪ ♪ As I work this wheel, evolving over time ♪ ♪ As wrinkles grow I feel ♪ ♪ The thirst within my mind ♪ ♪ Oh, but the dreams of youth hold ♪ ♪ Hold fast through hail and fog ♪ ♪ The wing beats of the heron ♪ ♪ The stamping of the hog ♪ ♪ All serve their clouded purpose ♪ ♪ Beyond the sand and cold ♪ ♪ Lithe fingers cloaked in shadow ♪ ♪ Spin darkness into gold ♪ ♪ As I work this wheel ♪ ♪ Evolving over time ♪ ♪ As wrinkles grow I feel ♪ ♪ The thirst within my mind ♪ ♪ As I work this wheel ♪ ♪ Evolving over time ♪ ♪ As wrinkles grow I feel ♪ ♪ The thirst within my mind ♪ ♪ This cold, blue, violence ♪ ♪ That you know ♪ ♪ Is so hard for me to swallow ♪ ♪ And all these moments lost ♪ ♪ In choking rage ♪ ♪ Slide of me, like sand swept off the page ♪ ♪ And all your vitriol ♪ ♪ It makes no sense ♪ ♪ You're a prisoner to cold, blue, violence ♪ ♪ This bird with tattered wings flies at night ♪ ♪ Hopes to hide before the daylight ♪ ♪ Sets the predator upon her shaking tail ♪ ♪ To be caught would be to leave this mortal coil ♪ ♪ Is it me, is this what you came to see ♪ ♪ Because it makes no sense this cold, blue, ♪ ♪ Is it me, is this what you came to see ♪ ♪ Because it makes no sense this cold, blue, violence ♪ ♪ Cold, blue, violence ♪
