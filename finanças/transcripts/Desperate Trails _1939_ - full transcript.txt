[uplifting music] [western music] [guns fire] [horses gallop] [guns fire] [hammers nail] [suspenseful music] I'll get it, Miss Plunkett. Oh, thank you Nebraska, you're a gentleman. -How're ya Bill? -Howdy, Marshal. Large new man, ain't ' he? Yeah. Sort of had an idea change might prove useful. Postmaster agreed with me. Hope he has better luck than the last one. Had to bury him. No trace up to now of the killers, is there Sheriff? Nope, took after them with a posse, but they just disappeared into thin air. It's gettin' me down. Me too. I'm relying on you, Ed. If any road agents show up, unlimber that rifle of yours and start shootin'. Ask questions after. What's this about road agents, Marshal? You expectin' a hold up? Way things have been goin' on around here, don't do no harm to be expectin', ma'am, just in case. Well hold up or no hold up, I've got to get over to Winston Forks. My sister's gonna have a baby, and she can't have it without me. Well, I hope the stork has been advised of the setup, ma'am. Oh, [laughs] go away with you, Marshal. Nebraska, get goin', I'm in a hurry. Yes'm, Mrs. Plunkett. Giddy up! [carriage rolls] -Everything all right, Bill? -Right as rain. Got a new guard, but the boys will take care of him. I hope there won't be any shootin'. No more than necessary, Mal, 'less somebody gets out of order. Maybe we could've found a better way. What, for instance? I don't know. That's right, Mal, you don't. In case you want to back down, I can ride out and call the boys off. -Huh? -Then you can do some explainin' about that mortgage you plastered on the Anchor J Ranch, belongin' to Judith Lantry. -[Mal shushes] -Nice bit of writin', Mal. The way you signed Judith's name was sure pretty to look at. Even fooled me. Bill, somebody might hear you. Stop your moanin', listen to what I've got to say. You sure you shipped that 5,000 on the stage? You know I did, Bill. -[Bill grunts] -I shipped it to the Monroe outfitter, Winston Forks. It belongs to them. You mean it did belong to 'em. It's all so simple, Mal. The boys pick it off the stage, bring it back here, and we've got 5,000 to pay off that pretty mortgage you fixed up, and nobody's the wiser. -[suspenseful music] -[horses gallop] Throw away those guns and pull up. Get that mail pouch up here and shove it back, pronto. Now you gents just sit quiet and make no mistakes. [horses gallop] Go get him, boys, he's got the mail pouch! [horse gallops] -[horses gallop] -[gun fires] [man shouts] -Held up, eh? -[Nebraska] Yes sir. Where'd it happen? Got us down there just below the pines, near the ridge. Grabbed the mail pouch single-handed, and got clean away. A lone hand? Yep, he's all alone, and he sure did work fast. -Had some shootin'? -[Nebraska] Yes sir. Three gents happened along, and took out after him. They opened up on him, and you know? That rascal blowed them right smack dab out of the saddle. Bap, bap, bap! Marshal, I'm glad you're here. You can see for yourself what goes on in these parts. Stage held up right under our very noses. Something ought to be done about it, Sheriff. Yes sir, and right now. That bandit won't get far. I'll round up a posse and take after him. I've got to get over to Winston Forks. Nebraska, hightail the lady over to Winston Forks, before it's too late. All right, Marshal. Giddy up! [carriage rolls] [people chatter] [horse gallops] [suspenseful music] [horse trots] Drop that gun, and throw up your hands, you've covered. [gun clacks on ground] Close the door and strike a light. There's matches on the table. I figured I might find you here, son. -I'm Marshal Cort. -Marshal Cort? [Jim] That's correct. I'm glad to know you, Hayden. Same here, sir. Have any trouble finding the cabin? Not at all. Tom Hobbs gave me your letter, and the rest was easy. So you held up the stage this morning, eh? How'd you know it was me? Well, three and one is four. It always has been. Three from four is one. What are you driving at? Three men knocked off their horses, and one got away. Figured it might be you. [laughs] Well, those gents were aiming to hold up the stage themselves. [Jim] You saw to change their mind for them, eh? Sort of. This job in Denton is not going to be easy, son. What's the setup? Stage holdups, cattle rustlin', comin' off mighty regular. Bein' Marshal, they watch me like a hawk, and things happen miles away. They must be mighty smart. Correct, and that's where you come in. You're going to visit an old friend. I am? Yep, Bill Strong at the Anchor J Ranch, just outside of town. Bill will give you all the help he can. Well, I guess that's about all I need to know, sir. I'll do what I can. [Jim] That oughta be enough. Now, if you'll break out with that mail pouch, I'll take that money along and deliver it where it belongs. Yes, sir.

Hmm. [horse gallops] -Howdy. -Howdy. Am I addressing Mr. Bill Strong? Well, you can leave off the mister and still be correct. I'm Steve Hayden. Well Hayden, I've been expecting you for quite a spell. -I'm sure glad to see you. -Thank you, sir. Who's that over there with Willy? Know him? Mighty snug and comfortable here. Yes sir, comfort's my middle name. Sit. Thanks. Are you a good liar? There ain't none better. Well getting down to cases, Mr. Strong, from now on you're an old friend of my dad's. You fought Indians together, and I'm just stopping over for a few days. Get the idea? I get the idea all right, but that Mr. Strong don't set so well. I'm Cousin Willy to my old friends. All right, it's Cousin Willy from now on. I think I'm gonna like it here. I'm gonna like having you here too. Come on, I'll show you where you bed down. Good. Well there she is, anytime you're ready to turn in. I bunk over yonder. Our ranch has been rustled pretty near bare of stock. Nothing been done about it? Can't do nothin' about it. Them rustlers are cagier than pet coons. I see. [laughs] It's much too good for you, Cousin Willy. That bed's softer than that one in there. Well, I think I'll ride into town and have a look around, see what I can stumble onto. I'll go with you. No, I think I'd better go alone. You being with me might shut some mouths I don't want shut. Yes, that's right. [laughs] We're gettin' off to a right smart start, ain't we? We sure are, and don't forget about my dad and the Indians. Oh, you can rest easy. I'll have plenty to say about them Indians when the time comes. Good. Well, I guess I'll mosey along. Say, what's the idea with the powder horn? Oh that, well, keep my bitters in it, so I's to have it handy when my stomach acts up. [laughs] -Well, so long, Cousin Willy. -So long. I guess he didn't want nothin' important. [horse gallops] Ortega drives her over from the station. The horses get out of control. Ortega does all he can to stop them, but it's no use. They bolt over the cliff, into the river. Ortega jumps at the last minute to save his own skin, and it's awful sad about Judith. But I don't like it, Bill, I don't like it. Well, maybe you'd like it better if Judith came here and caught you red-handed. That'd tie me in, and we'd both be stretchin' a rope. No, no, no, no, Bill. It's deplorable, but are you sure it'll be an accident? How many times have I got to tell ya? [train whistle blows] Here she comes. [train engine chugs] I'll come back quiet-like on Thursday's stage. Good, I hope I'll have something interesting to report. You will, and good luck son. Thanks, I might need it. -So long. -So long. [conductor] All aboard! [train engine starts] Hello, Miss Judith. You remember Ortega, don't you? Oh yes, Ortega, certainly, how are you? Fine. Ortega's always that way. Have you seen Cousin Willy? Oh that Cousin, he forget to come and get you, so Mr. Culp, he send Ortega. Well, Cousin Willy won't be so glad to see me after I dress him down. -Ortega take the bag. -Thank you. [carriage rolls] [horse gallops] [suspenseful music] -Ortega, watch out! -Ah. Turn the mares to the bank, Ortega! I can do nothing. The beasts are in their teeth. Well use the brakes! [splashes] I'll have a look down below and see what's going on. Yes, please do. They're all right, ma'am, all three of them paddling out like water dogs. Oh, I'm so glad. Are you feeling better, ma'am? I'm all right now, thanks to you. You don't need to thank me. -It was a pleasure. -A pleasure? Well, I mean I was just lucky to be passing along. Oh, well it was really I that was lucky. Have it your own way, ma'am. I'm Judith Lantry. I'm mighty glad to know you. My name's Hayden, Steve Hayden. How do you do, Mr. Hayden? It's a mighty sad bit of driving, I calls it. Oh, those broncs are only half-broken. Ortega did his best. If that's his best, I'd sure hate to see his worst. -Why, what do you mean? -Well, nothing. Now, if you're going over to Denton, and don't mind riding side-saddle, I can horse you up behind me, and we can get going. I don't mind at all. Up you go. [carriage rolls] [gasps] Bill! [horse gallops] I knew something would go wrong. She ain't in the river, she's here. Oh, stop your cacklin' and come on. I'll do the talkin'. -Well, well, Miss Judith. -Hello, Sheriff. Kind of strange seeing you come into town this way. Where's Ortega? The last I saw of him, he was scrambling out of the river. -Out of the river? -Out of the river? Yep, he went over the cliff with the rig. He got a little wet, but he'll be along soon. Over the cliff? Why, I can't understand that. Oh, it was terrible. The team ran away, and Ortega couldn't hold them. If Mr. Hayden here hadn't seen it, I don't know what might have happened. Did you get Miss Judith out of the rig? Just before it went over. Give me your hand, Hayden. We owe you a heap for saving Miss Judith. We certainly do, Mr. Hayden. I'll never forget it. Thank you, gents, there wasn't much to it. Now you come along, Miss Judith. You must be terribly upset after your experience. -Come now. -Thanks again, Mr. Hayden. Are you stopping in Denton? Not exactly, but I'll be around. I hope so, goodbye. -Goodbye, ma'am. -Come along, Miss Judith. Come along, there, there, now look out. Oh dear, that must've been a terrible experience, my poor child. -Where're you from, Hayden? -Over yonder. -Where you bound? -Over yonder. Where you stoppin'? -With friends. -Stopping long? Maybe, maybe not. So long, Sheriff. [grunts] [horse gallops] Nice bit of riding you pulled off today, Hayden. Thanks. Name is Waters, Clem Waters. Mighty glad to know you, Waters. Meet up with Joe Peters here. Howdy, Joe. You boys working? Not right now, we ain't. Well, I might have a job for you in a day or so, if I decide to settle down. Good, we'd like to ride for you. Where you aiming on locating? Well, I haven't made up my mind yet. Well, if you want a couple of punches who'll ride for you on the square, me and Joe here is just what you're lookin' for. -I thought I had that feeling when I met up with you. -Thanks, Hayden. Of all the bumblin', loco, jug-headed half-breeds I ever met up with, you're it. But SeñorBill, until my foot, she's get caught, everything is all right. All right? You call that nap-fella' grab Judith out of the buckboard the last minute all right? But I don't see him. My foot, she's get caught, and when I look up, he is there. Well, why didn't you do something about it? But SeñorBill, I can't do anything. My foot, she's-- You've told me that a hundred times! Si,I know, and the water is terrible cold. I think I get sick, no? You'll get plenty sick if you make any more mistakes. But I no make no mistakes, SeñorBill. My foot, she is get caught. -Get out. -Si, SeñorBill. [horses gallop] Thank you very much, Mrs. Watkins, for driving me out. I do appreciate it. No trouble at all, honey, goodbye. -Bye. -Giddy up. [carriage rolls] Judith! Well Judith, honey, where'd you come from? I'm sure glad to see you. -Cousin Willy? -Uh-oh. Why didn't you meet the train? Answer me that. Meet the train? I didn't even know you was comin'. Now Cousin Willy, I wrote you a letter weeks ago. Did you, well that's funny. I didn't get no letter, honest. Maybe it was on one of them stages that was held up. There'd been a heap of that lately. Hmm, well anyway I'm here now, Cousin Willy, so we'll just forget about it. Oh, it's nice to be back. I've missed the ranch. Cousin Willy? Come here. Now would you mind telling me why you're using my room? Well, you see, it's on account of my rheumatism. It's been bothering me, and my room's a little damp. Damp, rheumatism. You get those things cleared out of there immediately. All right, honey. Oh, I plum forgot to tell ya. I've got a friend visitin' me. I'm not at all interested in any of your old cronies. He ain't old, he's young, and good lookin' too. How nice. Might I inquire his name? Name's Steve Hayden, and you'll like him. -Steve Hayden? -Yep. His dad and me fought the Indians together. I saved his life once when a squaw was just about to stab him-- Cousin Willy? Get those things cleared out. Yes, honey. Them Indians was sure wearing a heap of warpaint-- Cousin Willy? Yes, honey.

[castanets click] Well, if it isn't my old friend, the high-diver. Rosita belong to Ortega. Does the lady know about it? Señor,you leave town now, pronto. [table crashes] Clem, pick up his gun. Looks to me like this gent is a little hot-headed. Maybe he needs cooling off. Run him outside, boys. [Rosita] Señor, do me the big favor. Shoot that pig. [speaks Spanish] Boys, he's mighty fond of water. Take him up and chuck him in the trough. Orders is orders. [speaks Spanish] -[water splashes] -[people laugh] -[gasps] -[speaks Spanish] He's still a little hot. You better dunk him again. -There he goes. -No, no, no! -[water splashes] -[people laugh] Ain't you a might high-handed, Hayden? Not to my way of thinking. He bored down on me and ran into a little bad luck, that's all. Drawed on ya'? Yep, but I'm right peaceful, or they'd be carrying him out by now. Well, I hope you get us that call to ride for you right soon, Hayden. Better sleep with the ears out of your blankets, just in case. Sure will. [laughs] Well, I gotta be going. -So long. -So long. [Rosita] Good night, Señor. [speaks Spanish] [horse gallops] It's Steve, Cousin Willy. What's the idea of locking me out? [laughs] Boy, I had a whooping time in town tonight. You should've been with me. I met up with a Spanish whippoorwill that slung a mean pair of castanets, and boy, dance. Those señoritassure know how to get around. [laughs] The next time you're in town, drop in at Mace's. It won't do you a bit of harm. [laughs] I don't think she carries a knife. [laughs] Cousin Willy, aren't you listening? Ah, looks like I'm wasting my breath. Sure sleeps like a log. [groans] Well, it was fun anyhow. Spanish whippoorwill. Cousin Willy, Cousin Willy. [mumbles] What're you doing in here? Sleepin', what do you think? Well, who's in the other room? The owner of this outfit. The owner? I thought you owned it. Who me? No. Well, when did he arrive? He? He ain't a he. It's a she. A she? Oh! -[horses gallop] -[men yell] Oh good morning, Mr. Hayden. Good morning, Miss Lantry. -It's nice to see you again. -Did you rest well? -Well, I can't say that I did. -I didn't think you would. -I'm sorry about last night. -Oh, that's quite all right. It was a perfectly natural mistake. -Oh, thank you, ma'am. -The name is Judith. Yes, ma'am, Miss Judith. You know, I'm a little puzzled. About what, Miss Judith? A Spanish whippoorwill. What does it look like? Oh, that's a very rare bird. There're not many of them left. Well, only a few folks has ever seen one. Oh, well it's the first time I've ever heard of any kind of a bird with castanets. Well, here you be, Judith. I want you to meet up with an old friend of mine. -We've met. -Yes, we've met. You have? Well, Steve's dad and me fought the Indians together. I saved his life once. Yes sir, an arrow was going straight for his heart. I reached out and stopped it in mid-air. I was awful fast with my hands in them days. I stopped that arrow just six inches from his heart-- Now what in the world is all this talk about Indians? Well you see, Marshal Cort sent me here to see if I could root out all those responsible for the crooked work that's been going on around here. Marshal Cort? He sent me sort of secret-like, so I fixed it up with Cousin Willy about my father and the Indians, so no one would suspect. Oh, I see. Well, you're more than welcome, Mr. Hayden. We certainly need someone. -[horses gallop] -Miss Judith! Oh, Miss Judith! What is it, Lon? 100 head of two-year-old horses, rustled out of the high meadow last night. 100 head? [Lon] Yes, ma'am, no trace of them. You mean to say no one was riding herd last night, after all the rustling that's been going on around here? Well no, we figured that sort of stuff was done with. You're not very good at figuring, are you? Maybe you quit school too soon. Huh? Now listen, you and your friends, they're not working here any longer. Now get going. Well, Miss Judith, you ain't gonna let him-- You heard what he said, now clear out. Mr. Hayden's in charge now, Lon. What he says goes. [horses gallop] I hope everything turns out all right. I'll try and get you hope for you, Miss Judith. Don't get up, Sheriff, just take it easy. What I've got to say won't take long. Go right ahead, Hayden. I'm gonna run things out at the Lantry ranch for a spell. Well, that is news. Maybe it is and maybe it isn't, but get this straight, Sheriff. I'm listenin'. There's been a lot of rustling going on out there. I know, but I've done all I could. Well I'm warning you and anybody else that might be interested, that there's any more of it, somebody'd better be ready to bury the dead. Look here, Hayden, you start any careless shootin', and I'll jail ya'. It won't be careless shootin', Sheriff. Well, so long. Oh, and you might pass the word along about burying the dead. -SeñorBill, SeñorBill. -What is it? That man who throw me in the trough, he is here. Shut up. -Si, Señor. -Hey Bill-- I know, I know, he was here, and he just left. -Here? -Yeah. You and Ortega take after him. That gent's about due to disappear entirely. Si, Señor. [suspenseful music] [horse gallops] [horses gallop] [men gasp] Señor,the rope is break my chest. Too bad it isn't your neck. Señor,for the love of all the saints, the rope! We ain't done nothin', let us down. Always glad to oblige. [men groan] What are you coyotes up to? Lookin' for a job. Nothin' against that, is there? No, but you were headed toward the Lantry ranch, and that's bad. Now get on your feet. Get over to that horse. Unsaddle this horse. But Señor,my arms. You won't be needed them where you're going. Now get moving. Stop him, stop him! Now, Bill! Get out of my way. Quick, quick Bob, back is broke. -Who done this? -Hayden. -Si, si. -Hayden? Yeah, he jumped us for no reason. He almost kill Ortega. You say he done this for no reason? -Si. -Yeah. He was gonna shoot us, but changed his mind. He said he was out to get you, Sheriff. You hear that folks, he's threatened me. I'm the Sheriff here. While I am, there'll be none of this high-handed bullying of innocent folks. It's him or me now, and I'm sending him fair warning to keep out of town. If he don't, I'll shoot him on sight. Anybody got any objections? Come on. [people mumble] [Mal gasps] [Willy] Hey, Steve! Hey, Steve, take a look at that. Low-down hound. Where'd you get it? Stickin' in the chopping block. Sneaked out in the night, I take it. Well, that's his style. Whatcha' gonna do? I'm going in and see what the Sheriff has got on his mind. I'm goin' with you. Nope, this is just between the Sheriff and me. I want to see fair play. It won't be play, Cousin Willy. Now don't say anything to Miss Judith about it, understand? Yes. [horse gallops] -[man yells] -[carriage rolls] -Hey Sonny, come here. -Yes, sir? Run down to the Sheriff's office, and tell him that man he's expecting is here. Yes, sir. Hey, Sheriff? Huh? [Sonny] That man you're expecting is here. The minute he gets near the hitch rail, we all blast him. Don't make a move, if you gentleman have any ideas about living longer. Drop those guns. -[guns drop] -Raise your hands. Now go on out that door. -Now look here, Hayden-- -You too. Hold it. Pick up the Sheriff and chuck him in the trough. Now wait now, wait I tell ya'-- [gun fires] [Bill] Now wait, wait, you can't do this to me. [Bill mumbles] You can't do this to me. [water splashes] [gasps] I'll get you for this, Hayden. Dunk him again, he ain't worth killing. -[Bill yells] -[water splashes] [gasps] [crickets chirp] [knocks on door] -Howdy, Mal. -Come in, gentlemen, come in. [suspenseful music] Well, maybe you're right Bill, but-- [Bill] Be quiet, I'll do the talking. We've got to work fast. Tomorrow, Lon's going over to Lycan's barn in the Buttes and get things squared away. From now on, anything we got to say will be said here. I ain't taking no chances 'till Hayden's taken care of. [leaves rustle] [Mal] What was that noise outside? [guns fire] [glass shatters] There she be, the old Lycan's barn. Well, let's have a look. [horses gallop] That door hasn't been here long. That padlock looks sort of new. [Clem] Danged if it don't. It's kind of strange, locking things up around here. Might stand looking into. Oh Clem, throw your rope over that hay boom, -while I tie up. -Right. [horses trot] [rope whooshes] I'll keep watch. If I see anybody headin' this way, I'll play "The Campbells are Coming" on my wheezer here. Cousin Willy, I don't know what I'd do without you. -[laughs] -[rooster crows] Nice bit of roping, Clem. I couldn't have done better myself. [rooster crows] [boards clatter] [concertina wheezes] [horse whinnies] It looks mighty interesting. [Clem] Sure does. [gasps] Well, there they are, just like I told you, the Anchor J horses. You mean Lon was in on it with Culp and the Sheriff? Yep, but we can't tie 'em up with it until we get more on him. Look, changed the Anchor J to the Circle Cross. A nice bit of crooked branding, I'd call it. -[horses gallop] -Whoa! [concertina wheezes] Oh, doggone it, right when I need it. Them doggone screws never will hold with you need 'em. Now we go. All right, you boys start branding down the other end. [concertina plays] ♪ The Campbells are coming, hey, hey ♪ ♪ The Campbells are coming, hey, hey ♪ ♪ The Campbells are coming ♪ It's Hayden! Hop on the wall! Come on, we'll head him off! [gun fires] -I'm leaving! -[concertina whooshes] [guns fire] -[bucket breaks] -[water splashes] Didn't you hear my warning? Get going. [horses gallop] [suspenseful music] [guns fire] [thuds] [punches] [men gasp] [water splashes] [suspenseful music] All right, come on. [speaks Spanish] -Hayden? -Si,it is Hayden. He's in the barn and sees the horses with the brands changed. -In the barn, eh? -Si,he knows. We'd better run away now, quick, before he comes. There ain't a gonna be no runnin' away. We're stickin' right here. What're you gonna do, Bill? Nothing could be sweeter. Y'all swear you caught Hayden in the barn, changing the brands on the horses he rustled from the Lantry ranch. You tried to bring him in, and he shot you down in cold blood. Si,we swear it is true. Where's Lon? Hayden shoot him down. We'll hang a murder on him too. Ortega, you ride out and spread the news that we're calling a vigilante's meeting. Si, SeñorBill. Now I've got him where I want him. -Are you sure, Bill? -Oh! Steve, what in the world... I just brought this coyote in for safekeeping. [Judith] But I still don't understand, Steve-- It's just like I told you, Miss Judith, Culp and the Sheriff are behind everything crooked going on around here. Culp and the Sheriff? Oh, are you sure, Steve? I thought so from the jump, and your trusty ex-foreman got unhappy about the whole setup and squealed, didn't you? Well, he lost his voice again. That's bad. -[gasps] -Yeah, yeah! That's better. We'll take this gent into town, and corral those other crooks. [horse gallops] I sent Clem into town to have a look around. Looks like he's got something on his mind. Steve, they're holding a vigilante's meeting in town, fixin' to lynch ya'. -Who's idea is that? -The Sheriff. Said he caught you changing the brand on the rustled stock over at Lycan's barn. Mighty smart, changing things around that way. That's what happened, I'll swear to it! [gasps] You boys get into town and delay that vigilante meeting. Marshal Cort is coming in on the down stage, and we'll hold a vigilante meeting of our own. -[Clem] Right. -Grab the buckboard, men. We haven't got time to saddle up. -[carriage rolls] -[suspenseful music] [men yell] Friends, I'm calling this meetin' to let you all in on some news that's mighty interestin'. This fellow Hayden has been ridin' folks in Denton with spurs as a rustlin' murderer. [crowd mutters] Here's livin' proof of what I'm a sayin'. He wounded these boys here and killed Lon, -[crowd gasps] -when they run into him at Lycan's barn, a changin' brands on the stocks he's rustled. [crowd mutters] And I'm mighty free in statin' it was him that held up them stagecoaches so frequent. [crowd mutters] We ain't got no place in Denton for a thievin', sneakin', cowardly murderer. [crowd yells] He's now at the Lantry ranch. Let us go get him. [crowd yells] Wait a minute, folks, now don't get hasty. If you're bent on hangin' him, I ain't taking no part in it. Of course, I know there ain't no use trying to stop you. [crowd mutters] Si, si,let us go and give it to him. [suspenseful music] [carriages crash] Look! It's Hayden, and he got... Whoa, Marshal. Oh, what're we gonna do? We're getting out of here, come on. Clem, you boys sure did some nice work. [horses gallop] [thuds] [laughs] Oh Bill, Bill, where are ya'? [laughs] Here, take care of this gent, and don't let him get away. I've got a little rounding up to do. [horse gallops] Here they are, Marshal. I'm turning them over to you. I ain't to blame. Big Bill made me do it. It's all his doin'. He made me do it at the point of a gun. He's lying, he done it. He forged the mortgage on the Lantry ranch. Save your breath, gents. You and your friends here with the cuffs on are gonna need it in court. Here, snap those on 'em. It'll give 'em somethin' to think about. Over there. Son, you did a mighty good job around here.
