[waves rumbling] - Being an artist and being a businessman are equally important to me. They both serve very different, yet very critical functions. Obviously, the business side allows me to live a certain lifestyle, or to have a life at all. And the artist side, also obviously, nourishes my soul. But you gotta grow up at some point. Struggling certainly loses its charm. When my corporate survival job gets too much for me to handle, I can steal an hour or two and just do a little playwriting. After bath time, after bedtime, a glass of single malt scotch. That's what's important to me. You know? It's important to me because I haven't given up on anything. I haven't cashed in. I don't see it as a compromise. - Hmm. - Yeah. I feel the same way. I know that you think, a house in the suburbs, kids, cars, we gave up our artistic-- - I don't think that. - [Alice] I know you do. Because I used to. - I don't. You don't know what I think. - Well, I'm still a dancer. - I know. - I'm a mommy but I'm still very much a dancer. - Alice, I know. - Okay, I'm just saying. - Well, you don't have to be saying. Look, guys, this is fantastic. Thank you for having me, it's been refreshing. - Yeah, any time. - Yeah, it's no problem. The train station is so close. We're still so close to the city. [dog barking] - So, Laura, what's new? - I finished a draft of my novel. - You know what? I'm feeling inspired. I'm gonna go do some playwriting. I'll leave you two ladies to the fire. And if you need anything, I'll be upstairs hammering away. - Okay, have fun. - I still remember that one play he wrote. - Oh God, that was like 10 years ago. - Really? Time is just-- - I know. Jack is gonna be five next month. - We're getting old. - You're not, I am. - Uh, I am, trust me. - Look at you. What's your secret? - Drink more wine than beer. Don't have kids. - Exactly, don't have fucking kids. [laughing] No, I love them though, I do. - Oh, they're amazing. - So, when are you gonna get married? - Oh, okay. - Well, what's wrong with Tom? - It's just not what we're doing right now. We don't even live together. - Trust me, I had the same reservations about Scott, but now everything's perfect. - [Woman] I know. - And you gotta have kids soon or you'll reach that advanced maternal age. - Yeah. - And it doesn't matter how much yoga you do. - Woo. [laughing] - [Alice] I'm sorry. - This just got heavy, huh? - No, I'm that girl. - I really love this fire pit. [woman sexually moaning] [pleasant music] - [Adam] Thank you for joining us here on Literature Today. My guest is Mariah Flannery. Best-selling author, also a wife and mother. Welcome, Mariah. - [Mariah] It is an honor to be on your podcast, Adam. I listen all the time when I'm walking my dog. - [Adam] That is so terrific. Now you started doing this just a couple of years ago? - [Mariah] I always wanted to be a writer so I just did it. Just to see what would come out. - [Adam Voiceover] And fortunately for us, what came out was PS Supernatural, a love story set in a high school, but not your typical high school. No, things here get a little, well, supernatural. - [Mariah] That's right. From the very beginning, from the morning announcements, you don't know who's a vampire, who's a zombie, who's a mythical sort of-- - [Adam] It's fantastic. - [Mariah] Thank you. - [Adam] And very successful, may I add. This book is flying off the selves. - [Mariah] Mark jokes about how he gets to quit his job now and I'm like, "No, if you're home all day I'll never write the sequel!" [Mariah and Adam laughing] â™ª Oh yeah - [Girl] Hey, Laura. [intense rock music] - It just all happened so quickly. You know, I'm backstage with the band, and it's late afternoon, so it's like a real weird time, and then there's Jimmy Kimmel and he's doing his thing, and he's actually pretty funny, then all of a sudden we're just out there and it's so surreal. You know, I felt like a big light was gonna fall on my head. [laughing] I was thinking to myself, okay, well, this is it. You're gonna die. Because that's the only thing that can ruin your career at this point. And that way, you'll go down in history not for your music but because you're the girl who died on Kimmel. - You guys were amazing. - Oh God, it was so hard to focus on the music, but you just, like, have to, you know? - I'm so happy for you. - I'm so happy for me. - You should be! [laughing] - Cheers. - Yeah! - So, how are you? How's the novel going? - I finished. - Yes, amazing. - Well, I finished a draft. - Still? - It's really not a big deal. - Uh, you wrote a whole novel. How many people can say that? - A lot it seems. - Okay. - So do people ask you when you're getting married or having kids? - No. I don't even have a boyfriend. - Nobody gives you shit for that? I feel like there's something wrong with me. I don't even have a cat. - Who wants a fucking cat? - Do you think it's because you're a musician? - I think so. People just assume I'm too unstable for that stuff. - I want people to assume that about me. Why don't they? - You kind of have a stable vibe. - I don't want a stable vibe. Do we need to do tequila shots or something? - Yeah, all right, I'll do shots. - Yes, I'm gonna go get them. I'm fucking serious. [somber music] [man laughing] - [Man] Good night with Heidi? - I mean, come on, Jimmy fucking Kimmel. And I don't want to be jealous, you know. Everyone's all fucking on her dick all day on Facebook and she does all these amazing things. - Come in here. - I just wanna come in here. - [Man] Come on into this bed. - Yeah, I just want to come into this bed. Thank you for letting me come over. - Stop thanking me. You have a key. - I know, but still. Okay, I promise, tomorrow we are gonna have a fun weekend. - Hey, you got drunk, it's no biggie. - I'm such a fuck-up. - No, you're not. - Why are you even with me? - Come on, babe, let's not go down this road. - Wait, no, are you horny? Because I'm sorry, I'm too drunk for that. [chuckling] - I'm fine. - I'm such a fucking mess. I'm not big and successful like Heidi. - You can't keep comparing yourself to everyone else. - I know, I know. I know that, I know. - You're doing fine. All you have to do tonight is go to sleep. - Are you mad 'cause I'm just a weekend girlfriend? - You're not just a weekend girlfriend. - I always leave on Sunday. - Why don't we talk about it tomorrow? - Why, because I'm drunk? [laughing] - Yes, because you're drunk and I'm tired. - We're okay, right? - We're perfect. - I have to say, I think you're a lot prettier in person. - Oh, please. - No, brains and beauty is a rare combination. - [Laura] Well, thank you, Adam. - So, you ready? - [Laura] Mhmm. [pleasant music] - Welcome to Literature Today. The podcast that covers writers that are very right now. I'm here with Laura Snow, the author of The Ends of Things. - It's an honor to be on your show, Adam. I listen to it while I'm walking my dog. - Oh. What kind of dog do you have? - I don't. I made that up. I... - Well, that's, I... The Ends of Things. Is that something you know a lot about, Laura? - I guess so. - This book flies in the face of convention. It takes all the rules of literature and just breaks them all apart. - Oh, I don't know about that. - It blew me away. You are a genius writer, Laura. Now, you're from Wisconsin, is that right? - [Laura] Originally, yes. - But your perspective is so much-- - I have lived all over. I've traveled so much. I've been, I don't know how many different countries. - Well, that is obvious. I'm just gonna come right out and say it plainly. You, Laura, are a highly successful professional writer who travels all over the world and hangs out with famous people. - Yes, that's pretty accurate. - So... [chuckling] Why did I just say that? - I'm sorry? - Why would I say that? That's a stupid thing to say. I wouldn't just... Is this a dream? - What? No. - This is a stupid fucking dream sequence, isn't it? Oh great. Oh, that's just great. A dream sequence, yes. And you're gonna wake up and gonna wanna tell your boyfriend all about it but he won't pay any attention unless it ends with and then I started going down on you. Listen to me, Laura, no one wants to hear about your fucking dreams. - Okay, fine, maybe it is a dream, okay? But would you just indulge me a little bit? I had a rough week. - No, no, no. Literature Today is a very important podcast, all right? I can't waste my time with some fake-ass book that hasn't even been written yet. - I finished a draft. - Dream sequence. How very, very stupid. Who does that anymore? Dream sequence, what's going on here? ooh, it was all a dream the whole time! That's great. Very cliche. Even your dreams are cliche, Laura. I can't imagine what your book must be like. - My book is good. - Oh, is it? Is it good, really? Do you have an editor? Do you have a publisher? Do you have a lit agent? No? Hm, how about that? You couldn't even get on my show. Stupid fake-ass book. What a waste of my time. The Ends of Things! How about the end of this fucking dream sequence? Where am I? Is this even a real door? Where does this lead, your subconscious? [food sizzling] [chuckling] - Okay, so obviously. - Good morning, sunshine. - Yeah. I had the craziest dream last night. You know that podcast-- - I made coffee. I made greasy potatoes with jalapenos. - [Laura] Oh, I love your greasy potatoes. - And coconut water and headache medicine. - [Laura] Goddamn you're good. - I'm a pro. I've been through it enough times. - Mhmm. - So what'd you do last night? - You know that documentary I was telling you about? The one about the homeless? - Was it good? - So good. - I should have left early and watched it with you. - No, you had fun. - What is wrong with me? - Nothing. So how's Heidi? Is she still jazzed about her Jimmy Kimmel thing? - Oh my God, she's on top of the world. - That's good. - Yeah. It feels cool to hang out with her, you know? We've been friends for 15 years or something, but now it's like, this lady's on the TV. - Did anyone recognize her? - She's not quite at that point yet. - Did you talk to boys? - No. [people chatting] I mean, guys were hitting on Heidi, like always. - I'm just being that boyfriend. It's my job, you know. - I don't deserve you. - Yes, you totally do. - Don't let me forget to do my unemployment later. - Okay. - You ever think about leaving New York? - Uh-oh. There it is. - No, don't panic. I'm just asking you a question. - Well, this is a red flag subject. - Look, I'm not going anywhere, I'm talking about you. - I have a good job here. - I know. - There's culture here. I mean, where would we even go? - Somewhere warm. I think about the sun and how much I need it. - It's the beginning of summer. - Yeah and then it will be October again. - That's the way calendars work. - Maybe I'm just feeling down about myself. - [Tom] Leaving is not always the answer. - Yeah, I know, Tom. I'm not talking about leaving. - Well, it's just scary. When you think about your past. - Okay. We don't have to talk about it. I'm sorry I asked. - How about I go down on you, make you forget about it. [laughing] - Yeah, but-- - I'm serious. - Oh. - It's the best way to forget your troubles. - Stop it. [chuckling] Is that the? Get off. [somber music] â™ª If I were suddenly gone â™ª I could be buried in your yard â™ª â™ª And make my living down there â™ª â™ª I'd share water with the birds â™ª â™ª Make friends with junipers â™ª Be happy going nowhere â™ª But I'm not really gone â™ª Don't think of it that way - Back for more? - Yes, please. - I haven't seen you in awhile. - Uh, yeah, I came to a stopping place. I took some time off, uh, gave myself some time. - With your novel? - Yeah. - You could still come in, you know. Get some coffee, talk to people. - I know. I know, you're right, I'm selfish. - [Ian] Well, I'm not saying you're selfish. - Well, but I am. - [Ian] I doubt that. You have, like, this peaceful aura. - I have a peaceful aura? - Yeah, here you go. - Thanks. How much is that? - [Ian] Ah, don't worry about it. - Thank you. - Yeah. Oh thanks. - I'm sorry, this is really embarrassing. What is your name again? - Ian. It's okay. - Ian. - And you're Laura. - Oh god and you remembered. - It's all right. Oh hey, I'm doing a show in the neighborhood, you should come check it out. Or at least humor me while I give you that postcard that you throw away later. - What kind of show? - You'll just have to come and experience it. - Oh, a mysterious kind of show. - It's a variety of unique performances. So it might suck. But it doesn't matter, cause you're not gonna actually come anyway. - How do you know? Maybe I'll go. - No one comes to stuff anymore. People like pictures of stuff online. That's the new coming to stuff. - God, it's true, isn't it? Well, maybe I can break that pattern. - That'd be awesome. All the information's on there. - Okay, thanks. â™ª Thank you, I'm with him â™ª Our lives and for each other's lives â™ª â™ª And think of ways to meet each other â™ª â™ª Tonight you'll regret your tattoos â™ª [people chattering] â™ª I'm spitting the shit that be dripping with dough â™ª â™ª Currency cash, currency flow â™ª I really wish I had mo â™ª Remember when me and my friend â™ª â™ª Used to gab for hours on end â™ª Sipping coffee in the Rav-4 â™ª What you fucking rap for â™ª Me, it's pure storytelling â™ª Crappy MC's rapping vapid like it's Tori Spelling â™ª â™ª Corey Feldman â™ª Get lost boy, you boring, lame â™ª â™ª I speaks like a beast, rest in peace to Corey Haim â™ª [audience laughing] - Honest! Why do you think they call me The Rail Splitter? But that was before I had these whiskers. See, before I ran for president in 1860, I never had a beard. Unless you count Mary Todd. [laughing] Just a little joke for you Log Cabin Republicans out there. [whistle blowing] [audience laughing] [whistle blowing] [whistle blowing] - This one's called Sour Pickles. She was like leave-in conditioner that I promptly washed out. But the smell stayed around for weeks. Every jacket I owned smelled like her eventually. So she became the signature scent of the Salvation Army. If you've been to the one on Bedford then you know her smell. Ki Ki, So-So. Ki-Ki! So So. Ki- ki, So-So, Ashe, Lha, Gyal, Lo, Tak, Seng, Khyung, Druk, Di, Yar, Kay! Thank you. - Yeah, the 15th, Tuesday. - All right. I'll see you there. Thank you for coming. - Hi, good job. - I can't believe you came. - Yeah, of course. This is Luis. - Hey, I'm Ian. Nice to meet you. - Really good job. - Thanks, thanks for coming. Do you live in Jersey City too? - [Luis] I was born and raised here. - Oh wow. - But I'm not mad about gentrification. I like craft beer. And expensive pancakes. [laughing] - That's good, that's good. This was just something weird I put together. - No, it was very smart. And witty too. - Yeah, really good. - We're gonna go to a barcade if you guys want to grab a drink. - Um, I think I have to pass. Yeah, we'll let you do your thing with your peeps. - [Ian] Ah, my "peeps." [laughing] - But thank you for inviting me. - Yeah, I'll see you soon, I hope. - Yeah, definitely. At the coffee shop. - At the coffee shop, right. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. â™ª The land low â™ª I want to meet, shame â™ª Come on â™ª You play when you come along [chuckling] - Hey. - Hey. So, I'm doing what you said. I'm coming in, I'm not writing, just talking to people. - Well, unfortunately there's no one here, so, I led you astray. - Well, you're here. - [Ian] I am here. [laughing] - But you're probably busy. - Yeah, it's a really important job. - At least you have a job. - Want a coffee? - Please. â™ª Feelin' wasted on - So, what would you like to talk about? - Oh God, I don't know. Let's just start. - Okay. Let's begin. - I'm wondering if you're a Buddhist because that chanting you were doing last night. - I study Buddhism enough to know these Tibetan chants, so I incorporated them, which maybe was dumb. - I don't think it was dumb at all. I do a lot of yoga so there's a lot incorporated. - I do some yoga too, I mean really beginning stuff. I got these big yoga blocks. - There's no shame in the blocks. - I got yoga blocks for Christmas. My dad wanted to take me to a Giants game. - Are you a sports guy? - I like sports, actually, I have no problem going to a Giants game. My favorite sport is soccer though. - I played soccer when I was a kid. - Everyone played soccer when they were a kid. - Yeah but I was good. - What position did you play? - I have no clue but I was good at it. - I played in high school, but I realized I had more of a future in theater than I did soccer, so I quit my senior year. - I always wanted to do theater but I didn't have the courage. - You still can do theatre if you want to. - I think it's a little late for that, I'm very comfortable sitting in coffee shops and writing. - Maybe it would shake things up for you. - I always wanted to be a stand-up comedian too, but I have absolutely nothing funny to talk about. - That you can still do, there are open mics all the time. I tried it a couple times. - [Laura] How'd it go? - Not good enough to keep doing it. Basically I learned that it wasn't something you were either good at or not but something you had to work at, just like everything else, and I thought, "Well I already have enough of those." - Did people laugh? - Here and there. I learned it was a much bigger thing than I thought it was. - Most things are, aren't they? - I'm starting to realize that. I feel like as I get older, all the little things fall apart. - Exactly. Once you've seen your friends achieve what we all want to achieve and then you see the continuation of it all, that nothing stops once you've achieved something. - I definitely see that. - I have a friend who's starting to be a really successful musician. - Uh-huh. - And besides just being happy for her and dealing with my own feelings about her success, it's also a really good opportunity for me to hold up a mirror to myself and say, okay, what am I doing?" - Like, why am I not doing what she's doing? - No, not exactly that because we do very different things so it's not a direct comparison, but more just looking at myself I can see all these different sides of life and I think, what do I want out of it all? - What's gonna make me happy? Because there's this pressure to get a real job and make real money but I know that money isn't the thing I'm after. I mean, it's different for everyone and it changes, it evolves, it has to. - What you think you want, we all graduate from college or whatever and we think we want this certain thing and we get jealous when someone gets it but then so many times I look at that person or that thing and it's not even that I wouldn't want that, it's just, I know it's not me. - That's really important, I think. It's like, what do I see myself doing? - You know, I realized that there is a big difference between wanting to be a writer and wanting to write all day long. Because being a writer, or being an actor, or being a poet, it's just about identity. I mean, who do you need to prove something to? - Who do you need to show that you are a certain thing, because I've had friends who experience some success in something and then decide they don't want it after all, so they move back home, they get married. - Which is a whole other thing, getting married, having kids. - Trust me, I've heard enough about that recently. - Oh my God, you have too? - It just seems like it's all around, even in New York City, it's like you get to a certain age, and everyone's having weddings and having babies and moving to the suburbs. - My other best friend just did exactly that, so now I have two best friends and one went this way and the other went the total opposite way and so I get it from all sides, you know, and even if I tell myself, I am not that, still someone else, like my mom, will look at me and compare me to them. - It's just natural, I guess. It's so hard not to compare yourself. Luckily, the girl I'm dating is only 27 so she's not quite ready for all that yet. â™ª A couple miles away â™ª Fallin' in love I don't even know â™ª â™ª What you're ready to say â™ª Wrong love â™ª Wrong love, love, love â™ª Wrong love - Yeah, my boyfriend's 37, so he actually does want to get married but we've only been together wight months so I'm like, give it time, okay? - I've always been so sure I was gonna get divorced that I never even really thought about getting married. - Are your parents divorced? - No, that's the weird thing, they're still together and they're like the perfect old married couple. - Yeah, mine are too but it's still scary. - [Ian] Maybe that's part of the fear, like we could never live up to it. - That we can never achieve that. Or that we see something in them, that maybe we think, maybe they should have gotten a divorce. - It's all so fucking confusing. - It really is. There's no one answer. Because everyone's like, why don't you get married? You should get married. But I have friends who got married and then got divorced and nobody thinks that's weird, that's just normal. - It's like, well at least she tried. - Right, but we're in the same place, the only difference is she had a wedding. - It all flows like this, everything is fluid, that's what people don't understand. It's not steps on a ladder, like, this, this, this, then this. Because life doesn't work that way. I mean, you could get married and then your husband dies in a horrible accident or I don't know. - Or he murders me because I'm not actually a good wife after all, I'm really only good at hiding away on my computer and writing my stories. - Yeah, you have to find someone that fits with what you wanna do day-to-day. Which goes back to what we were talking about earlier. - Yeah, which is why I'm not sure I want to marry Tom. I mean, we have fun together, but as a lifelong commitment. - Lifelong, exactly. - I mean, I like watching stuff on Netflix too. I like just hanging out, being homebodies, I get it, we're both in our 30s, but sometimes I want to grab the coffee table and right in the middle of us watching fucking Netflix, throw it right in his fucking 55 inch TV and shatter the whole fucking thing. [car horn honks] - I'm that way. - Okay. I'm that way. - Goodnight. [somber guitar music] â™ª The coroner proclaimed me in good health â™ª â™ª And released me â™ª Praiseworthy are the ghosts that fly â™ª â™ª Contemplations, congregations â™ª â™ª Continual release â™ª Morose are the ghosts that fly â™ª â™ª You're the spectral waves â™ª Lifting dead weight â™ª Gifted are the ghosts that fly â™ª - Was that your boyfriend? Who came to my show? - Luis? No, he's a friend. He's obviously gay. - Oh. I thought that was him. - That wasn't him. - I guess I was hoping your boyfriend was gay. - Why? â™ª When all you have - Maybe I shouldn't have come over here. - I think what's gonna happen is inevitable. - What's gonna happen? - I don't know. - But you know it's inevitable. - Exactly. â™ª The ghosts that fly â™ª Gone are the ghosts â™ª The ghosts that fly â™ª Serenading few â™ª Are as hopeless as you'd think â™ª â™ª Corrosive are the ghosts that fly â™ª â™ª Condemned their path through â™ª Burning for a drink â™ª Impatient are the ghosts that fly â™ª â™ª When all you have - Does that mean the real Lord Byron? - Shh. - Yes, yield those lips, for which I'd brave more than I here shall dare to tell. Thy innocence and mine to save, I bid thee now a last, farewell. [coughing] Yes, yield that breast, to seek despair and hope no more thy soft embrace, which to obtain, my soul would dare, all, all reproach, but thy disgrace. At least from guilt shall thou be free. No matron shall thy shame reprove. Though cureless pangs may prey on me, no martyr shall thou be to love. [clapping] Thank you, thank you, you're very kind. I shall now like to open the floor to any questions. Yes? - Hi, first of all, great job, you're a good writer. I'm wondering, did you have anyone specific in mind that you were, like, writing to? - Yes, yes I did. Her name is Laura. And ours is a love story that spans continents, countries, even time itself. She is the incarnation of all matters of the heart. And she will go down as one of the great lovers in history. - I'm not seeing that on your Wikipedia. - But alas, our love was not to be. For she was not a reality in my time. Yes? - So, do you, like, have a day job? Or is this all that you do? - There you are sir, keep reading. - Thank you. - Hi, Mr. Lord Byron. - I came here only for you. Men will fall at your feet. They will compose sonnets, they will wage wars over you, they will chase you around the world. I came to see if maybe I may have a chance. - Sorry. Things are really complicated right now. There's these two other guys-- - Say no more. Say no more. Ah, the sweet poetry of heartbreak. - Sorry. I'm not an ideal girlfriend, you know that. - I don't need you to be an ideal anything. - But it can't just be a weekend thing. - You're the one who makes it a weekend thing, Laura. You could move in if you wanted to. - But I don't think I'm ready for that, that's the problem. - Look, if you're breaking up with me, then that's what this is. - I'm sorry, Tom. - It's not just, um... You just don't feel enough for me? - You deserve more than this. - But you're not gonna be the one to give it to me. - I think we are looking for different things. - Look, I'm just gonna stop this right here, you don't have to keep coming up with lines. - They're not lines. - Yes, they are, they're breakup lines. I know I'm not the writer here, but I know when you're coming up with lines. Look, let's just leave it. - I think I am thinking about leaving New York. - See. I fucking knew that shit. - [Laura] But I knew that you wouldn't want to come with me. - But you're not giving me a chance though. Maybe I could see leaving New York, but you don't think like a couple. You have this enormous ego. It's like it's easy to fall in love with Laura and to start dating Laura, but really that just means we're both in love with Laura. We're both just dating Laura. - Maybe I should come back for my stuff. - You don't really have much here. You never did. - So are you gonna break up with what's-her-name? - We're not that serious, but yeah. - Like? - I mean, not today probably. - Why not today? - Well, it's just a shitty time. Her grandma just died. I mean, she was dying already and I'm not a part of this at all, but she's down in Florida right now, so. - Oh, I see. Bad timing. - Yeah. Really bad timing. - I always have bad timing. Like, right when I was leaving Portland, I met this guy, we totally fell in love. - Oh yeah? - He was a musician. I mean, he was all over the place, we had no chance. But I decided that I wanted to live in New York. And once I decide something like that, even if it's just a quick decision, there's no stopping me. - So you don't talk to him anymore? - Why would we? - [Ian] Well, you fell in love at some point. - Yeah, exactly, how can we be anything after that? - Not even just hey, hope you're doing well? - Not really my style. - What is your style? - Many cities, many men. - Wow. [laughing] - I'm half-joking. - Yeah, but only half. - Why are you so worried about my ex-boyfriend? - I'm not. - He'll be fine. You want me to reconnect with him? - No, I just might be him one day. - Oh. Okay. Well, technically you still have a girlfriend. - I guess. Kind of. - Timing. - I gotta go that way. - Okay. I gotta go to the city. - What are you up to? - I gotta go get my stuff from my ex-boyfriend's apartment, do that whole thing. - Right, okay. So we'll, uh? - Of course, yeah. - Okay. See ya. - Yep, see ya. - [Man] I already spoke to your roommates. - Isn't there some kind of regulation against raising it that much? $300? - There would be if it was rent-controlled or regulated. Sorry, Laura. - I've been here two years. Isn't there some sort of leeway for being a good tenant? - [Man] You haven't always paid on time. - But most of the time. - It's not for another month. You have time to figure things out. - Okay. - How's your writing going? - Fine. - You know, if you're a really good writer, maybe you can make some money doing that. - Yeah. [somber guitar music] â™ª Eulogize me now â™ª Wanna know what I done wrong â™ª To deserve all this song â™ª My conscious â™ª Eulogize me now â™ª I wanna know what I done right â™ª â™ª To deserve all this fight â™ª Of my only life â™ª Hold strangers' hand â™ª Praying for the end â™ª It's no way to spend â™ª Your dying days â™ª Tell me what I've done wrong â™ª And I can â™ª Move on â™ª Hold strangers' hand â™ª Waiting on the end â™ª It's no way to spend â™ª Your dying day - Hi, I'm Dave. You wanna sit down? - Sure. - What's your name? [moaning] So what'd you say, you were a writer? - Yeah, I just finished a novel. - I'd love to read it. - I don't think so. - Why not? - It's-- - You scared? - No, it's not really ready for a lot of people to read. - You gotta get it out there. You sending it out? - Yeah, a little. - Any bites? - Can't get anyone important to read it. My sister likes it. - Your sister's important. [laughing] - Not in the publishing world. - What's the title? - The Ends of Things. - I damn sure know enough about that. The ends of things? Like marriage and shit? - It's just sort of an all-encompassing title. - Yeah, man. I know enough about that. - The title might change. - Hm. The Ending of Shit. Yeah, man. Tough racket. I could never figure out how to make money doing anything cool, so fuck it, you know? - How long have you lived here? - Not exactly the penthouse suite is it? - Well. - My buddy Derek and his wife are letting me crash. It's been a tough couple of years, man. - Yeah. Me too. - Would you ever consider being with me? Like, for real? - Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah, why not? - You're fucking lyin'. That's okay. You're young. - I'm not that young. - Ah well. At least I got my taste, right? [somber music] - [Girl] Have you been on the beach this whole time? - [Laura] No, not the whole time. I met someone. - [Girl] Oh shit! - [Guy] Nice, who'd you meet? - I don't know. His name's Dave. - Oh, Dave, that makes sense. I did coke with him once. - Oh. - Yeah, old guy, right? Really cool though. - Do you want some rum? - I should go take a shower. - People are coming over, we're gonna hang in the back, okay? - [Laura] Okay. - You should come hang. - I'll be here. [laughing] - She's pretty cool, huh? - She's pretty directionless though, I mean, what is she doing, you know? She's like 40. - 32! - Yeah, rounded to the nearest 40, that's 40, dude. That's what you get from Craigslist, I guess. - Do you think she listens to us fuck? - Probably. [waves rumbling] - See, if I were gonna get a tattoo, I'd want it to mean something. - [Guy] Yeah, buddy. - You know, like stand for, like, world peace. - Yeah. Hey, babe. It's like you were saying, no one wants to just do it. Just go for it. Go to Europe. - [Guy] Exactly. - [Dylan] Or Africa. - Dude, I've always wanted to go to Africa. - See, we should go to Africa. Save our money and just, like, find the cheapest way to go to Africa and make that dream a reality. - It's like everyone wants to get married or get some career. Like, why are they in a hurry? It'll all still be there tomorrow, I promise you. - I wanna travel, that's for sure. That's definite. - Yeah, man, me too. - Hey, what are y'all playing? - We're playing Keep It Up. - [Guy] Who's winning? - We all are, man. We're all winning. [laughing] - I'm gonna go cross-country, that's something I definitely want to do. - Dude, yeah, fuck, man, me too, I just want to, like, see all that shit. - I've done it. - Seriously? - Yeah. I mean, it's definitely something you should experience, but it's also just a lot of highway, you know? - But all those different landscapes and meeting all those different people. - Yeah. - That's awesome, I cannot wait. I wanna get, like, an RV. Me and Dylan have talked about it a bunch. - Dude, I'm fucking coming with you guys. - Yes, yes, you totally can. We were thinking about next summer, just like, see who's down and split gas and all that shit. - I'm so fucking down. I just have to get out. So what's your deal? You're coming from New York? - Yeah. Before that, Portland. Before that, L.A., just for a little bit. And Texas, which was random. - Wow. - Yeah. Home girl's been all over. - Oh, well, it's not really as romantic as it sounds. [laughing] â™ª Your one piece or two piece â™ª The Speedo we rockin', the one piece â™ª - So, do you love him? - I mean, yeah, I think so. - So why isn't he here with you? - I didn't give him much warning, I just sort of left. But I told him where I was going. - Isn't that a little fucked up? I'm just asking. - He was dating someone else. Some 27 year-old. Which, I know that's not young for you guys. - No, we totally get it. That's like a 17 year-old for us. - Right? And also I had just broken up with someone and I just felt like, I have to move on. I have to leave. And if it's meant to be, then-- - What about Facebook and Instagram and all that shit? - [Laura] I'm taking a break from all that. - Oh my God, I wish I could do that. - Me too. - I mean, it definitely felt like it was love. But, it was maybe just fairytale bullshit. - How do you know? - Because he's not here. - Maybe he's just scared. - He knows how I feel about him. - My butt is itching today. - He shouldn't let fear stop him from doing things. I'm scared. We're all fucking scared. But we grit our teeth and we go, you know, we do things. We pack our bags, we drive cross-country, right? - Yeah, hell yeah! - We sit in the sun and we drink beer! And we eat the best cheese curls that have ever been curled! We have Tiki-torches afire, the torches are aflame! I don't have to be married, I do not have to be a successful writer because you know what, it doesn't matter, because it is all happening right here, right now! This is it! This really is just it! Oh thank you. Thank you, boys and girls, 'cause I'm 32 years-old! Thank you, 32, thank you. Thank you, I am 32. Thank you. [somber guitar music] â™ª The air is full of radio waves â™ª â™ª The air is full of radio waves â™ª â™ª Somewhere â™ª Deep within my mind â™ª There's a beacon beaming signals out to you â™ª â™ª Steady â™ª Periodic â™ª A broadcast from a station â™ª It's never off the air from this point on â™ª â™ª No matter what befalls â™ª I am a sonic phantom â™ª Passing through your walls â™ª I used to be a quitter - [Ian] So do you have a lease here? - No, I'm doing a month-to-month. You know me. But, it's kind of a drifter place and everybody's really cool. They're young. They're really young. Did you quit your job or do you have to go back? - I'm a manager there. - Really? - Yeah. - I didn't know that. - For the last two years. So yes, I have to go back. - So what is this, like a vacation? - I don't know what it is. - My whole life's a vacation, that's what I decided. - I have a hotel. - [Laura] What, why? - I didn't know what the situation was here or even if you wanted me to stay. - Stay here. Yeah, cancel that shit. - I've never done anything like this before. I mean, it's exciting. It's a nervous kind of exciting. But good, you know. - Let's drink our tequila. - Okay. - Okay. - I'm sorry. This is weird. I shouldn't have come here. I feel like I'm forcing something. You left New York, right? You left me behind. And now I just show up. Who shows up? No one just shows up anymore. This is the 21st century, we have a hundred different ways to contact each other. I should have messaged you, I should have sent you a picture of my dick at least. I expect you to go in blind? With no dick pics? What if it changed? I don't even know if you want me here. Do you want me here? - I pictured you walking down that pier a million times. I'm not really sure if I'm dreaming this whole thing right now. - You are. - I am? - Yes. - Wait, am I? Wait, I am? [laughing] - Are you really not sure? Did you go crazy already? [somber music] [thumping] [Laura moaning] - Stop it. Stop it, Dylan. [Laura moaning] [pleasant piano music] [singing in foreign language] - [Cathy] So is he gonna move here? - We haven't really talked about it. - Must be nice having guys fly around the world to see you. - Or just a rental car down the East Coast. - Still. [giggling] - He has to go home tomorrow, but for the future, who knows, we're sort of leaving it open. - That's awesome. No commitments, you don't feel trapped. Sometimes I think me and Dylan are too young for what we're doing. - Nah, you're good. - But then I look at him and I'm like, fuck, dude, I wanna marry this fucking dude, you know? - Yeah. [waves rumbling] I think I'm falling in love with you. [waves rumbling] - No, I mean, day-to-day, what will you be doing? - Same thing I always do. Write, do yoga, drink a lot of water. Probably start waitressing somewhere when unemployment runs out. - Well, it's a nice, quaint place. - What are you gonna do in New York? - Yeah, I mean, same thing I've done. Work at the coffee shop. Do my thing. - That's just our reality, isn't it? We're both-- - What? - Stubborn. - Yeah. I mean, I guess. But I also feel like you ran away. - Yeah. And you could run away too. - Yeah, but, in a way, I can't. - Exactly. Both stubborn. - [Ian] Won't you get lonely? - I'm very comfortable being alone. That's sort of the problem. - Yeah, except when you're not. "Many cities, many men." - I was being flippant. - There's the guy you broke up with, then there's me, then there's some old guy at the beach. - You said you weren't mad about that. - Being mad doesn't matter. But it means that you're somewhere. I don't know where, but you are somewhere. - Well, you were somewhere too, dating your 27 year-old. - We broke up and I took the time that I needed. - [Laura] Fine. This is silly. - [Ian] Is it? - I'm ready. I'm open. I'm here. - Yeah, you're here. - So what, I have to move back to New York if I'm really ready? - No, not necessarily, I just mean are you ready to not be fucking around? - I live my life a certain way, it's not fucking around. - I know, I didn't... I just think if things are out of whack, then you do things, slowly, to put them more in whack. - Well, I don't like doing things slowly. Life's just gonna have to be out of whack. So will I see you again? - Laura, I wanna see you all the time. So, maybe we'll figure something out. It's not like you went to China. - I could go to China. - [Ian] Well, if you do. - You'll follow me to China? - Probably not. It is possible to escape, you know, if you really want to. - See ya. I went to the beach because I wanted to live, what's the word? Deliberately. - That's very spiritual of you. - Please, Sharon, I don't wanna act like I'm some spiritual leader. - But you are. Your book, The Ends of Things, contains a lot of wisdom. And the way you're meditating now, letting everything go, focusing only on the breath, it's very inspiring. - Thank you. - If you're just joining us on Mindful Chat, we're here with best-selling author and spiritual leader, Laura Snow. - I'm very honored to be here, Sharon. - Now, tell me more about moving to the beach on a whim, I think that's just great. - I lived with a group of younger adults who became my friends. I don't want to call them disciples but I think they found a teacher in me. - Very generous. - I think I related to them because I maintain a youthful outlook on life. - We all should. - What about you, Sharon? I'd like to hear more about you. - No one ever asks about me. - It's part of my thing. - Okay. Well, after graduate school, I traveled to India where I studied with my guru and practiced meditation and yoga and now I'm a Buddhist teacher. I work with at-risk youth in inner cities. I've had five books published, non-fiction. In addition to a couple of novels. Those were mostly for fun. - Uh huh. - Now, I-- - Cool, cool. Should we get back to talking about me and my book now? - Oh. Yeah, of course. - Just 'cause, my publisher would be mad. - No. Yeah. The Ends of Things. [somber guitar music] â™ª The coroner proclaimed me in good health â™ª â™ª And released me â™ª Praiseworthy are the ghosts that fly â™ª [laughing] â™ª Contemplations, congregations â™ª â™ª Continual release â™ª Morose are the ghosts that fly â™ª - I read your thing, dude. It's really dope. The End of Stuff. - Thanks, Dylan. - You know what you should do? You should get on social media and connect with publishers or whatever. Hashtags and shit. I know you're not really that type of person but you can't write in a vacuum. Dude, your shit is good. - Yeah, you're right. - You're really pretty too, you know that? You shouldn't have left New York, that's for sure. Want one? - No, thanks. - I'd like to live in New York. Or New Orleans. Fucking sweet. Like, London or some shit. Tokyo. - Come on, one beer. I haven't seen you in a couple months. - Okay, but really, I just came by to say hello, just as a friend. - Whatever you need, doll. - It's warm. - [Dave] Yeah. - There you go, the lap of luxury. I'm getting my own place. - Oh yeah? - I signed the lease this morning, so pretty soon I'll be a real adult. - That's great, congratulations. - I'm glad you're here to celebrate it with. - Me too. - I gotta piss. If you gotta go to the bathroom, it's the one near the laundry. It's not so clean, but the toilet works. [birds chirping] [pleasant guitar music] - You guys are all set. [chuckling] - I feel like this is my big moment to say something brilliant. I don't have anything, obviously. I'm just here. - Hi. - Yeah, that's good. Hi. - [Ian] You have your whole life with you, I see. Moving back? - I think so, yeah. - That's good. I think, more opportunity for you here. At least you can have meetings and send emails and be... - What are you talking about? - I'm saying, you're in New York, that's good. - Ian, I came back here because of you. You realize that, don't you? That's obvious, isn't it? - You didn't really keep up the chatter. - The chatter? What does that mean? - It's been like two months. - I figured we were figuring stuff out. - Yeah, I guess we were. - So what is going on? - I got back together with Chelsea. We're talking about getting a place. My rent's going up and I don't wanna live with roommates anymore. - That's not a good reason to-- - It's not the only reason. - Do you love her? No, that's stupid, of course you'll say yes. Do you wanna be with her? Really? â™ª They say hey â™ª Morning called on the 11th day â™ª â™ª So you'll just wait a while - This is really difficult. I felt so strongly about you, I still feel so... I tried, you know? - Yeah and I'm right here. I showed up, just like you. So it's not like you're more heroic in this. - I'm not trying to be heroic. - So, Ian, we want the same thing, what's the problem? - The problem is we don't have a relationship. - We don't have a normal relationship. - It doesn't have to be normal but it has to be a relationship. You didn't even want to be friends. - I don't need friends. - Honestly, I've just never been sure if you really, actually care about me. - What do you think I am? - I think you're a good person. - You obviously don't. - I do. It's just, like, you're chasing something and I don't feel like it includes me. â™ª Some mystery that you wanna solve â™ª - I feel so stupid. - Don't feel stupid. - Don't tell me what to feel. - I'm just trying to comfort you. - I have every right to feel stupid, look at me. I have everything I own, which is nothing. I came here to this fucking coffee shop. I'm at least gonna own this feeling of stupid. At least I'm not moving in with some girl just to save on rent. [phone ringing] - [Ian] I gotta get back to work. - Okay. - [Ian] Do you want a coffee? [somber music] - Oh, you're in New York, great. We'll get a drink when I get back. No, no, I'm in Austin. Oh, oh, but hey, yeah, I'm subletting my place but you should talk to the guy who's staying there, he's like an important journalist or something. [somber music] - Yeah. Yeah, you should totally come here another weekend, we had so much fun. Maybe we can do it at the end of the month. We just have so much going on right now. [dial tone ringing] [phone buzzing] - Laura Snow. - Not tonight, boo. [somber music] - [Woman] Are you Laura? - Yes. - Then I'm gonna take the liberty of sitting down. I'm Chelsea, Ian's, you know, girlfriend or whatever. - Oh my God, of course you are. Look at you, you're fucking adorable and perfect. - I'm sorry about Ian. He doesn't know what he wants. He's confused. - Yeah, he is, right? - He's not brave enough to follow his heart. I know that. You know that. - Yes, thank you. - So, I knocked some sense into him. You're the one he should be with, obviously. - Okay, thanks, um, so... - So you can go ahead over to his apartment and unpack, I guess. - What about you? - Oh, I'll be fine! I'm just gonna wait it out again. - Wait it out? - Yeah. I mean, after you guys break up. - Oh, we might stay together. Yeah, what we had was real. - Eeeh, yeah, I mean, we're talking about a relationship, not your strong point, let's be honest. I mean, after you've gone to all the restaurants, cooked each other all the meals, seen each other in all the outfits, shown each other all the different ways your parents have screwed you up, that's probably gonna be it. So when you decide to pack up and find someone new in your long list of lovers, in your oh-so-adventurous life, I'll be there to take Ian back. So there's nothing to worry about! - Okay, okay. Yeah, and maybe, one day, you and I could even be friends. - Oh, no. I hate you with so much passion. - Oh, really? - Yeah. I've attended meetings. I've been to support groups for women who hate other women. - You're making me feel really guilty right now. - Oh, I learned this in group. I can't make you feel anything. It's your feeling. You have to own it. So, yeah, go ahead, Ian's waiting for you. In hell. Where you belong. You fucking dickhead. - Hey. Sorry to call. I mean, you maybe don't care but I'm kind of in a bind right now. [chuckling] - I don't like seeing you like this. - Like what? - Sheepish. Like you did something really bad. - I wasn't a good girlfriend. - So what, Laura? You've always said that as if it's some badge of fucking honor. You're not a good girlfriend, congratulations. How could anybody be with you? You're such a fuck-up. You're unpredictable. I have to say, it loses its charm. - I don't have to stay here, I could get a hotel. - I'm not saying that, I'm just... You can sleep on the couch, it's fine. I'm not gonna throw you out on the street. I just have leftover anger. - That's totally fair. - Do you want something to drink? - No, I'm okay with water, thank you. - So where did you think you were gonna stay? - With the guy that I met after we broke up. - That you met after we broke up, okay, I believe that. - Well, I mean, I met him, I guess-- - It doesn't matter. I mean, actually I guess I do kinda wanna know the story, just 'cause I'm curious, but I think it hurts too much to hear, so for now we'll just... - Yeah. - Maybe you can find a sublet somewhere. - I'm gonna start looking now. Like right now. - Start tomorrow, please. Okay, I really don't like seeing you like this. - I'm 32-years-old, Tom. This is ridiculous. Why'd I turn out like this? What did I do wrong? - Nothing. You got a degree, you've moved to all these different places by yourself, you've had jobs, you've had apartments, you've paid rent, most of the time. It's not like the rest of the world has it all figured out and you're just some fuck-up. Everything is unstable. You just put one foot in front of the other. That's like the only thing to do. - [Laura] I know, I'm trying. â™ª It's a specialty of mine - Okay fellas, that's $7.24 - So, where do you live? - I'm sorry? - I mean in general. Not like, what's your address? - Yeah, I just moved to a new place in Newark. - Newark, ugh, shit. - Oh well, hey, it's what I can afford. - So what else do you do? Are you an actress? - I'm a writer. - You're too pretty to be a writer, come on. - Thank you. Okay. Well, you fellas have a great day. - Oh my God, I fucking suck at this. - No, hey, you're doing good. - No, ever since my divorce, it's-- - Look, just walk it off. - Facebook. - Get back in there. You're fine. - Do you maybe? So you wanna grab a drink sometime? - Oh, I'm flattered. But I'm sort of focused on other things right now. - I get it, I get it. Thank you. This has been helpful. - See, there you go. - Okay, well, good luck with the divorce. - Thank you. I appreciate this. Really. - Every little bit helps. - Yeah. [somber guitar music] - Oh hi. What, wait. Okay. No, no, no, no. Well, no one in the building knows where you came from, kitty. What's that about? You just found your way here, huh? Are you a good kitty? Or are you evil? [giggling] How about Pepper? I always wanted to be called Pepper. But I didn't think anyone would take me seriously. Not that anyone does now. You can't question it too much. It'll drive you crazy. It's like you. Where'd you come from? I'll never know. I will never know that. That doesn't matter, 'cause you're here now. With Ian it felt different. It felt like maybe he could be a true love. Like maybe we would find a cabin by a lake somewhere and grow old together and have kids. Or maybe a cat. [sighing] But I guess not. What can I say? Being human's fucking tough, Pepper. It's real tough. You have no idea. [purring] - Owning a house is just one thing after another. We had this tree, you see that right there? And it started splitting and Scott was like, "Babe, look at that tree." - It's gonna fall on our shed. - "It's gonna fall on our shed." So we had to pay thousands of dollars just to have some remove it before it destroyed our shed. Stupid trees. - Stupid trees. - But it's worth it. â™ª This is for us now â™ª Foolish little games - I'm really proud of you, Alice. - Thanks. So what's new with you? I feel like I haven't seen you in months. - I got a cat. - You did? - Yeah. - That's great.
