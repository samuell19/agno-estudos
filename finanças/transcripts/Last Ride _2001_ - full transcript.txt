I think I'm just excited. Maybe a little nervous about moving. Here you go. - Thank you. Hey, Dad, how's the market? - Hm? - The stock market, Dad, how's business? - Oh, it's fine. So, you all packed up, ready for the big move? - Yep, everything I have is ready to go to Canada. - You know, honey, I'm really glad you're okay with our moving. I didn't think you'd take it this well. - Why is that? - Well, it's gonna be tough for you. You and Mike, you kids have been friends forever. - That Mike, he was always a troublemaker. - Oh, come on, he is not. I think he's a good boy. - I guess it hasn't really hit me that we're actually moving tomorrow. - I want you to enjoy this last day with your buddies, as best as you possibly can. - Don't worry, Mom, I will. - So, David, I want you to come right home after school and help your mom, okay? - All right, sure, Dad. - I want you to come home when you're done hanging out with your friends. - Thanks, Mom. (car horn beeping) Oh, that's Mike, I gotta go. - Hey, wait a minute, did you get enough to eat? - Yeah, I'm fine, thanks, Mom. - Well, but you didn't-- - [David] Love you. - Love you, too. - What up, kid? - Nothing, man, let's just get out of here. - Okay, eh. - Shut up, dickhead, let's just go. (car engine roaring) - Oh, what the fuck you doing, bro? You gotta wear that to school today. - What the fuck are you talking about, spank dummy? I'm not going to school on my last day in California. - Oh, Mr. Rebel, you got something planned for us, dude? - Yeah, dude, we're going to Bear. - Bear, bro, what about your fucking gear? You gonna rent it up there, huh, Davey, the fucking newbie. - Dude. I told you to bring my fucking shit, dude. I left it at your house. You were supposed to bring it this morning. - You did? - Yeah. - Oh, I'm just fucking with you.

It takes forever. Why can't you just get your brother's ID, man? - I know, I know, he just never gave it to me, man. - Thank you, sweetie. Dude, that sucks man. - Dude, tell me about it, he's my own fucking brother, man. I mean, I helped the guy move twice, right, and all I asked him for for payment was to get me one of those IDs so I can use it. And he's all like, no problem, when I'm carrying his couch and shit, but now he's like too fucking busy or something. - It's all because of his old lady, man. - Dude, he's definitely pussy-whipped. He doesn't do anything fucking cool anymore. He just fucking, ah, he can't even be bothered, man. - I'll never get a full foundation. - Dude, fuck that, bro. - Never. - Fuck no. - What you guys gotta start doing is pumping iron and eating right. And before you know it, you're gonna turn to fat. The chicks like a tight body. - Dude, what do you think, skating and snowboarding keeps us in good enough shape already. - You're not always gonna have enough time to board, bro. And besides, you need to put on some size, get strong, to fend off those injuries. - Look, look, look, guy, that's some really great advice, but alls we really asked you for is to get us some beer. - Hey, look, I'm just trying to put you on the right path to a healthy lifestyle. - Look, what would be healthy right now, would be for me to get some beers, so I can score some chicks tonight. - Well, I can't help you with that, besides, beer's fattening. Tell you what, though, if you're looking for a good trainer, here's my card, and listen, my studio's right by the Bowling Barn. All right, guys, take care. - Take care, man. - You fucking believe this guy, man? - I don't know, man, I think he had something to say. - Aw, shit, are you kidding me? Look, go ask this guy coming up right here, all right? - Fuck off, bitch, I asked last time, man. - Fuck you did, go ask him. - Stop being such a woman and go get me some alcohol, man. - Fuck, fuck, whatever. I'm gonna ask this chick coming up right here. But if she doesn't do it, bro, you're gonna fucking pull the runner, all right? - All right, go, go. - Excuse me, miss, we left our IDs at home and we were wondering you could get us a bottle of Jaeger. - I'm not 21. - Yeah, right, what are you, like, 50? - Yeah, I'm 50, you punk ass little bi-- - What? Yeah, we gotta get out of here. Fuck, man, that fucking bitch, bro. - I wanna punch her in her face, man. - It's just fucked, though. We'll go over to Bear liquor, and you can pull that runner.

Nobody's gonna steal from me anymore. You understand? (tires squealing) I'm getting tired of you stupid kids stealing from me. (gun cocks) (gun shoots) - We just fucking got shot at. We just got, fuck, bro, we just got shot at with a fucking gun, gimme that bottle. That fucking bottle. Woo, holy shit, bro. We just got fucking shot at, bro. She shot at us with a fucking gun, dude. She just shot at us with a fucking gun, Dave, that was so cool, bro. She just shot at us with a fucking gun, and check out our new fucking shiny bottle of alcohol. That was so fucking cool. - What's up, yeah. - Listen, bro, we just got fucking shot at, bro. - No way, who shot at you, was it snowboarders? - No, listen bro. (laughing) Bear Liquor, yo, she fucking blasted us, it was so fucking cool. - It's crazy, rippers, come on, go inside, drink some beer. - You wanna go? - A bunch of hotties I picked up on the hill today. - Tips. - You can, just go scoop. (beer can opening) - Yo, Dave, what's up, man? - Just hanging out, buddy. - Right on. Hey, man, you gonna ride with us tomorrow? - No, I'm moving to Canada. - Oh, shit, Canada. - Canada? - Canada. - Moving to fucking Canada, in winter, beeyotch. - Where the fuck is that? - Calgary, man. - That's fucked up. - Aw, it's cool, man, it's my parents picking the nonsense city, there's a shitload of snow, fucking goes on up there. - Yeah, whatever, that's cool. Anyway, hey, man, we're going up to Mammoth tomorrow. We're staying at my teat's condo. Hey, hottie. - It's gonna be awesome, we're getting dumped on right now. - Yeah. - Really? - Oh yeah. - All right, so check it out, right. We find this big hit, and it's huge, and a 30 foot gap, huh? - Made it bigger, man. - Right, so I look at Dave, and I'm like, are you gonna go first, or am I? He says no, fucking pussy, you found it, you go first, I'm like whatever, right? So I fully charge it, right, hit it with all this speed, and ollie as big as I can off the edge of it, and I barely make it, I mean, a couple more inches, and I'm totally fucked, right, so it's his turn to go now, I look up at him, and I don't know what he was thinking. He fully charges, I guess he's trying to make up for being such a pussy, or whatever, right, he goes at it with all this speed, and he tries to spin a 540, - Oh, I fully pulled it, though, dude. - Yeah, right, he lands perfectly, except he's like five feet short of the gap, right? He just, just, lands and just bounces off, right? He's like five feet in the air, completely clears the gap, falls right on his feet, and just keeps on flipping down the mountain. - Seriously, that hurt so bad. - So he's tumbling, right, he gets up, his face is all bloody, it's all fucked up and shit, right, and I look at him and I'm like, bro, you okay? And all he can say is, oh man, I busted my noggin, I busted my noggin. (laughing) - I remember just looking at him, aw, dude, I'm slow, it's slow. - It's slow, right, so he points his board straight, he goes down the mountain about 60 miles per hour, I mean, I gotta fully struggle just to keep up with this guy, right? He still beats me to the bottom by like half a mile, right. So now we're sitting down there, and we're unbinding and shit, and he looks up at me and goes, where are we? And I'm like, dude, we're in Big Bear. Now he kinda trips out, he's like, Big Bear, how the fuck did we get there, right? I think he's fucking with me, right? And then I look at him in the eye and I can tell. I can tell that this guy's all messed up, and he's telling the truth, so I just gotta fucking freak out. - I can remember my name and everything else, I just I could not remember driving up there that day, or riding at all. - [Girl] That's crazy. - Actually it was kinda fun. I never had that feeling before. It was fun. - Fun, fun, right, fun for you, maybe. That's ridiculous. - Stop. - Have you ever been out like that? - Well, I don't like going around banging up my head or anything like that, but I broke my arm last year in a couple of places, you know, and I had to deal. - [Girl] How'd it happen? - Mikey, you, oh, why don't you and Clark Kent stop hoarding all the girlies? - Hey, Junior, it's not a question of Mike and Dave hoarding us, rather it's us hoarding them. - Sassy. That sounds good. Mikey, it's dumping up at Mammoth, you gotta go. - Dude, I can't, I gotta get this guy home by tonight, bro, tonight, that's it. ♫ Oh, Canada, oh, Canada - All right, it'll be awfully sad if we can't go up. - You gotta go, it's your last weekend. - Dude, it's gonna be the last time we can ride together for awhile, let's fucking go. Let's go. - Uh, oh, that's nice, we'll roll a few fatties on the way up, we will smoke fatties there, we will hook up with some hotties, we will ride, fish, fish, fish, hold on, hold on, hold on. - Sounds good man, but my dad would kill me, though, man. - Fuck it, bro, who cares about your dad? It's your last weekend, man, this is it. This is it, bro. - All right, yeah, fuck it, let's do it. (cheering) - Aw, yeah. (giggling) So, Dave, why don't you find the bong and load up a fat bowl for these beautiful young ladies, all right? - All right. - All right, Dave. - But where's it at, man? - Bro, I don't know, that's why I asked you to find it, huh? - Hey. (laughing) - So listen, you guys like boarding, huh? - Yeah, it's pretty dope. - Uh-huh. - You, you are good, you are good. (laughing) - I've been riding since last year. - Seriously, most girls, they ride kinda whack, but I like your style, you know, you just go bombing the runs, you know, hitting the jones and stuff, I don't know. You know, kinda wild. - I'm trying to get better. - Listen, you're good now, though, seriously. Alls you need to do though, is ride with a couple guys like me and Dave over here, and you'll start progressing really fast, seriously. - Really. - I guarantee that. - Well, we'll just have to go riding, won't we? - [Mike] Oh, absolutely, we've gotta try. (laughing) - You need some help? - I have found the bong. - Sweet. - Aw, yeah. - [Mike] Why don't you load that up, stinky, huh? - All right, gimme a second. - Get it going. (laughing) - So are you guys excited about Mammoth? - [Mike] Oh my god, it's gonna be so dope. - Yeah, my friend Lucy's going up there with her parents, I wish I could go. - Why can't you go, what's the problem? - [Girl] Her mom won't let her. (laughing) - [Mike] Get outta here, seriously? - Mm-mm. - That's too bad. - You got a light in there? - Yeah, it's right here, bro, but pass that bong over. I'm taking it. - Had me fucking loadin' it, and now you're green's rent? - He's a whiny little bitch, right? (laughing) No, he's not a whiny little bitch. Easy there, bro, don't knock it over, go ahead. Come on, big one, now, a big one for daddy. (laughing) (gurgling) He's out. (laughing) - No way. - Ooh. (laughing) Well, I guess it's just me and you two sexy ladies, huh?

It's just gonna be a matter of time before we're stuck, you know, and we end up like you. - I'd do anything to trade places with you guys. - Dude, what, and be stuck out here in the middle of nowhere, and now gas, no money, man, we're up shit's creek, dude. - No, man, just not having to worry about anything, but just having a good time. - Bro, you gotta help us out. Just think about it. You know what it's like, you have a kid, bro, think about your kid, he's gonna be shredding up one day, he's gonna wanna go snowboarding. That's what we are, we're out here, we wanna go snowboarding, dude, we're stuck, we just need, we need a little bit of money, bro, just help us out. - All right, guys, I'll fill this beast up. - Yee, nice. - Nice, you're the man, bro, I like you. - Hey, you smoke weed? - Yeah, I smoke weed. - How 'bout we give you a fatty of our killer endo. - That'd be cool. - Dude, it's so fucking dope out here, you guys. Look at all the fucking powder, man. - Dude, dude, I'm gonna find me the biggest fucking kicker and do a back flip, man. - This place is so big, man. What happens if I lose you guys? - Junior, dude, we'll wait for you, all right? - Yeah, dude, if you fucking lag at all, bro, just meet us at warmer hut two at four o'clock. You know where that is. - Let's roast 'em all. - Shit, yeah, dude. - Woo. Wonder what the park's like here, dude, huh? - Dude, fuck that park, bro, I wanna ride all this powder in the back country. - Oh, no, no, I do not wanna get stuck back there, man. - Oh, no, no, I do not wanna get stuck back there. Junior, come on, dude, Junior. If you want, I'll show you where the bunny trail is. I know you like it, and I know you can handle it. - Yeah, Junior, Dave loves that fucking run, it's his favorite fucking run, man. He knows exactly where it is, bro. No, listen, listen, listen, you don't have, you don't have to explain to me, man, it's all right, it's all right. - Shut up, little boy, or you're gonna know what being scared's all about. - Ooh, I better be quiet or the grandfather of snowboarding is gonna kick my ass. - Come on, dude, let's fucking ride, you know? ♫ Destiny, cooling like gravity ♫ Leaving my hands empty ♫ You have grown away from me ♫ Sliding away from reality ♫ Playing with destiny ♫ Riding on fast ♫ Away from the past ♫ Doubting words that don't mean a thing ♫ Trying to survive ♫ I raced down the slopes ♫ Of life ♫ Destiny - I've never seen anyone get worked that hard. But you must've flipped over like five or six times, bro. - Dude, at least I have the edge to make breakfast. - Look, fuck that, at least I'm smart enough not to get worked by some stupid kicker out there. That shit was funnier than an Adam Sandler movie, bro. - Whatever, man. Dude, you think Junior's gonna be boned about riding all day by himself? - Fuck that, dude, he's a big boy, he can take care of himself. Let's go. - Yeah, I just think it'd suck if I rode Mammoth all day by myself. - Dave, I came here to fucking ride, dude, not to fucking babysit Junior, man. - Still, man, I wouldn't want to ride this whole mountain by myself, man. - [Junior] Seriously, after I get done questioning my old lady, I go in to get myself a beer, and standing there, in this sexy nightgown, is her best friend right? - Oh. - She's looking really good, so I'm just chilling, I'm watching her. I mean, she turns around, she turns around, and she is all nipples holding a cold beer, dude. - Yeah, dog, I love hot nipples. - Oh yeah. She gives me this sexy little smile, she's like, would you like a beer? Ooh, and I say, that's what I came in here for, and she goes, is that all you came in here for? And then I go, what did you have in mind, and I swear to god, the bitch says, you fucking me right here on the counter. (laughing) My pants dropped faster than my mouth. - That's bullshit, man, that shit never happened. - Yo, that shit did happen, kid, I'm telling you. - Yo, what up, Junior, I see you made it down in one piece. - You guys missed out. The way I took was nice. - Get back to the story. You boned your girl and her best friend one night, is that it? - [Junior] No, no, it gets better. - Yo, how much better can it get? - So I'm done boning her on the kitchen floor, I go back into my bedroom to get into bed with my old, do I have some shit still on my nose? (laughing) Okay, I get back into bed, I think I'm getting into bed with my old lady, but I was so faded I ended up in her sister's room. - No fucking way. - I don't know if I was too drunk or fucking confused from fucking so much, but I laid back just to pass out, man and psycho bitch jumps me. I'm thinking, what's up, my, my old lady wants to fuck twice in one night? Until I heard the voice. (laughing) I won't tell if you don't tell. Yeah, I knew I was in for round three, baby. (cheering) - Damn, I love this story, that's hot. - Did you get busted by any of them? - That's the beauty of the whole story, I got off scott free. - Three cooking cooters in one night, that's sick. (laughing) - I'm no player, I just crush a lot. - Oh. - You loosen up the park today, or what? - Nah, dude, we were hitting up that fresh powder in the back country, dude, you know. - Powder hounds, dude, you got to got to the park, dude, it's going on. - Yo, man, let's get some quickies and then get back up on that mountain, man.

(ringing) - Hello? Put it back over here. Hello, hey. What's going on, man, how you doing? I'll call you back. Jesus Christ. Here, have a beer, man. My main man, step up, have a beer.

Whoop. - No, you're doing good, man, keep focusing in like you're doing, really, it's impressive. You should watch Mark Brown and take some lessons from him (ringing) And you're making progress. - I appreciate it. - Your stuff's looking good. - I really wanna get on-- - You will. Hello? - Here you go. - Thanks. - Wow, what you got going on with that bartender, bro? - Nothing, we're just talking. - Hey, guys, over here. Bring me some seven and sos. - Yeah, we're gonna get so fucked up tonight, you guys, this shit's for free. - Hey, man, where's my beer? - Aw, fuck, man, I guess Dave forgot, bro, he was trying to hook up with that sexy bartender. - Come on, man, you're kidding me. Give me your beer. Hey, someone give me a beer, guys. Someone give me a beer. I'm letting you stay at my house. You guys suck, man, you know that? I'm gonna remember that next time you wanna stay at my house. - Hey, if you remember, could you bring me back a beer? - Yeah, I'll take one, too, bro. - Yeah, can you make that three, four. - [Man] You're a bunch of dicks, you know that?

(cheering) Our savior. - Aw, man, you guys are assholes. I brought those bucket beers, I thought I would at least get one. Aw come on, guys, I just waited in line with all those sweaty mother fuckers and I'm thirsty. (laughing) Come on. - Stop the whining and take mine, bitch, why don't you go grab another round. - Hey Rob, you're gonna have to go get off that dance floor, you know what I'm saying? - None of you boys can dance. - Are you kidding me man, Soul Train dancer. - So, uh, how 'bout later on, me and you get together and play a little math game, yeah? - How do you play the math game? - Well, first you add me and you together, you subtract the clothes, divide the legs and start multiplying. - You know, I was never good at math. - Um, well, in that case, I seem to have lost my number. Can I have yours? - Oh, what a coincidence, I just lost mine, and I was just about to ask you for yours. What can I get you? - Can I get six beers? - So I'll catch you later? - You got any pitchers back there? - Yeah, lemme get you a couple. - So, must get hit on a lot, you know, being a bartender and all. - Yep, all the time. - That must suck. - It's not so bad, I just wish sometimes I was looking through their beer goggles, you know? - Do you think girls in Canada will need beer goggles when a guy like me's hitting on them? - What? - Oh, I'm moving to Canada in a couple days. - What, is this a line you're feeding me? - No, I'm really moving to Canada. I just thought you, being Canadian and all, maybe you could give me some pointers. - Where are you moving to Canada? Where are you going? - This place called Calgary. - Calgary, I grew up in Calgary. - That's cool, so you must know where all the cool mountains are, or what it's like. Are there any cool mountains? - Shit, the snow up there's so good, sometimes I don't know why I left it. You need glasses with that? - No, I'm good, thanks. My name's Dave. - I'm Madison. - Thanks. - Hey, Dave, keep that cute smile, you'll be just fine with those Canadian girls.

You don't even know, there really is a perfect time, man. - What are you talking about, dude? Look at Junior over there, making an ass of himself. (laughing) Look at him, what an idiot. - [Man] That guy's not even gonna score tonight, man. - Ow, ow. - Shit, dude, check out that hot chick Mike is dancing with. - Dick. - Maybe I could hook up with one of her friends, though. - Yeah, that's my boy, dude, yeah. - What a dick. - Now I'm fully gonna hook up with one of her friends. - So you wanna go get a beer? - Uh, no. - Oh, dude, what happened, man? - I don't know. - Where'd she go, man? - Fuck her, she's a bitch, man. - Shit, I was gonna hook up with one of her friends. - Yeah, you blew it, man. - Fuck you, dude, at least I'm trying to get some pussy. What the fuck you doing? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Well, check this shit out. Come on, man, let's go hit on those chicks. - All right, I hope this doesn't fuck up my timing, though. - What the fuck is up with that guy, bro, he can be such a little bitch boy sometimes. - Born that way, I guess, dude. Gonna grab another beer, want one? - Yeah, I want another beer. - So you gonna ride tomorrow? - Yeah, definitely, man, I didn't have enough time today. - Call, they got a great half pipe in there. - So how good are you? - Pretty good. I like to ride fast and hard. - Really. - Here's a little something on the house for you. - (environment drowns out voice) see you later. - Okay, I'll be waiting right here for you. - So, I was so humiliated today. There I was on the chair, and I looked down and I saw this girl, riding down and wait, she was wearing the same snow outfit I had on, oh, I just wanted to die, you know what I'm saying? - Oh, man, that's the worst thing I ever heard. - Luckily, you know, we had her dad's credit card, we just went straight to shop and bought her a new one. - No fucking way, no way, seriously? Listen, I swear to god, the same exact thing happened to me just the other day. Same exact fucking thing, man. Except I didn't have my daddy's credit card so I had to ride the rest of the day without any fucking pants on. - Hey, what's up? Anybody want some beer? - No, thank you, I only drink wine coolers. - That's the best stuff. - What the fuck are you talking about, dude? - That shit's the most disgusting shit I've ever had in my fucking life, man. - God, is your friend ever rude. - Dude, I gotta take a fucking piss. - Let's hit the head, man. - See you guys later. - Holy shit, I am so fucking drunk. - Dude, you gotta slow down before you pass out again or you ain't gonna get laid again. - Oh, what are you talking about, dude, I got her in the bag, man. - Aw, shit, what her, man, you got your Playboy here again, or something? - Ah. - I gotta take a piss, man. - No way, dude, I'm next, man. - Fuck you, bro, I'm jumping in there, man. - She's all over me, right? She's fucking freaking and up and down up here. - Did you use the phrase that pays? - What, man? - Make love to my buttocks, Manny. - What? - Oh, what the fuck, dude? - What? - You just fucking pissed on me, man. - I didn't fucking piss on you, bro. - No, then why the fuck is my hand wet, bro? - I don't know, man, maybe you pissed on yourself 'cause your dick's so small, bro. - What are you, a fucking faggot or something, bro? You're looking at my dick? - Who you calling a faggot? - You, bitch. Mother fucker. Yeah, you had enough yet, pussy? Fucking knock you out. Better stay the fuck down, bitch, fucking knock you out. Stay the fuck down. C'mon, bitch, c'mon. Shit, yeah. - Let's get outta here, man. - Yeah, all right. Hey, fucker, don't ever piss on me again, bitch. - Whoa, dude, thanks a lot, I didn't get to take a piss. - Whatever, dude, whatever, did you see how I fucked that dude up in the bathroom, bro? - Yeah, dude, I saw you fuck him up, man. - All right, what's happening, guys? Listen to this, bro, I just beat this guy's ass down in the bathroom. - No shit? - Swear to god, bro, he was fucking pissing on me, so I threw down and knocked the dude out. - So what went down? - I'll tell you what went down. What went down is I didn't get to fucking take a piss, that's what went down. Is there another fucking bathroom in this place, or what? - Yeah, there's a bathroom over there by the front entrance. - All right. Finish the story, all right, Rocky? - Yeah, so check it out, right? So I'm standing there taking a piss, right, he starts sprinkling a little bit over me, I guess he's all fucking drunk or something, so I square off to him, I'm like yo, what up, bitch - So I understand you're looking for a math tutor. - Hey, Dave, what's up? - How's your night going? - It's going all right. You know, people don't tip as well when the drinks are free, so kinda sucks. - So, how 'bout a drink? - Well, I don't know, I was about to go on break. - Come on, you are not gonna make me get a drink from that guy. (laughing) - Okay, I'll make you a deal. You come and hang out with me on my break, and I'll give you all the free beers you want. How's that? - Aren't they already free? - Yeah, but I didn't have anything else to bribe you with. - Well, then, I guess that's the best deal going. - Okay, cool. Ooh. Ah, that sounds good. - What? - Silence. There's a difference, working at a bar, and being at a bar. - Is that because you're always sober when you're working at the bar? - No, I'm usually pretty fucked up. I guess it's because I'm working and I'm behind a bar and I can't go anywhere. Stuck. - I guess I never thought of it that way. - So what's taking you to Calgary? - You know, why do any Americans move to Calgary? - I don't know, oil, hockey? - Yeah, hockey. I was drafted by a minor league team there. - Really? Which one? - It was, um, (laughs) I can't even think of their name right now. - Whatever, it happens. You know, you're pretty cute. - Thanks. (laughing) - And kinda shy, too, huh? Aw, come on, don't worry about it, it's a good thing. Listen, I gotta get back. - Already? - Yeah, I gotta get back. You coming in? - Nah, I'm just gonna hang here for a bit. - All right, catch you later. - Fuck, I'm such an idiot. - I do not remember my friends looking so good. - Ah, excuse me, we've never met, so how expose my friends? - Ooh hoo, fiesty, hot temper, that can only mean one thing. - You know, I don't know what you're thinking, but just dream on, babe. - I'm just a big old huggable teddy bear. - Hey, Junior, you, why don't you introduce me to your fucking hot little hos. - Dave, Dave, yo, I thought you passed out in a corner somewhere, man. - Whatever, dick, dude. So anyway, my name's Dave. (laughing) - Anyway, now that my friends have introduced themselves, obviously they're drunk, we can get back to what we were talking about. So if you wanna get sponsored, the best thing you gotta do is take a shot of you doing some sort of air or something, right? Then take that down to your local board shop-- - Okay, no, no, no, no, no, that's not what you gotta do. You gotta be able to store more nuts than a squirrel. - Huh? - You know, milk the cow. - What? - Feed the weasel. - Yeah, I'm good with animals. - Hey, (environment drowns out voice), all right? - Unless, of course, you're good at it. Oh, oh, oh. - Oh my god, you guys are assholes. - I'm sorry that guy's drunk. - Whatever, man. - All right, let's get outta here. - Only if you bail your friends. - Right on, let's go. - Are you coming, Jase? - Oh, is that how it is, you just diss your friends when pussy calls? - Word. - What do you say you and me find a dark little corner and get to know each other a whole lot better? - Why don't you just get a life? (laughing) - Oh, Dave, Dave, listen to me, listen to me, listen. Those fucking guys, those guys are idiots, bro, did you see how prude those chicks were? They weren't gonna fucking put out anyway, man. - You know what, guys, you guys are beautiful. No, hey, come on, it's four ripping snowboarders. Young, good looking, pissed out of our minds. We need to get laid. - Junior, you're a freak. - Oh, sex pot want things free. - Hey, fellers, fellers, we need to get this fucker laid, that's who we need to get laid, we need to make his last night with us fucking memorable, man. Fucking memorable. - Fuck you, I don't need your help getting laid, dude. - Yeah? - No, seriously, dude. - Too much? - To tell you the truth, man, I'm just fucking fine happy hanging out with my bros, man. - Oh. - Well, guys, as truly touching as that is, I would much rather be getting laid on my last night than hanging out with you hooligans. - Yo, dude, don't get me wrong, I'd love to get me some pussy, man. - Hey, then maybe you guys should just follow my lead. - Why? - Shit, don't you remember? I was the only white guy to be featured on Soul Train. - Ooh, Soul Train. - What's your name? - What? - What is your name? - What? - Are you having a good time? - I can't hear a word you're saying. - I've been looking all over for you. I thought you left. - Ah, no, I'm hanging out with my friends. - That's cool. You been having fun? - Yeah, yeah, we're having a good time. - So I just finished. I'm off for the rest of the night. - Great, you gonna hang out and have a couple beers? - No, I just wanna get out of her. - All right. That's cool. Good meeting you, though. Thanks for all the advice about Canada. - So listen, I was thinking of grabbing a couple of beers and going back to my place. I was hoping you'd come. - Really? - Yeah. - Sounds good. - All right, so let's get going. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going so fast, huh? Where you going so fast, you just got here, bro. - I'm going home with my new friend, Dave. - Oh, your new friend, Dave, huh? Dave, Dave, Dave, buddy, buddy, bro. - Talk to you later, man. - Bitch. - Sup. - Dude, you see (environment drowns out voice) what Dave just took home? - No, was she hot? - Dude, you know that fucking bartender tonight? - Almost as good looking as her? - Dude, that was her, bro, that was her. - No way. - Absolutely. - I'm so fucking drunk, I can't, just go. - Dude, I know, I know, I know, I know. I can't drive home, I'm all fucked up. - What are you talking about? - I'm drunk, you know. - We didn't drive here, we walked. Come on. - So you can put those in the fridge. Right through there. What do you wanna hear? - What do you have? - [Madison] Everything from Beastie Boys to Frank Sinatra. - Whatever, you pick. - [Madison] Okay. - A man can beat the horses, can do anything he makes up his mind to do. You like Bukowski? - [Madison] Yeah, I love him. - I haven't met that many people that have even heard of him, let alone read him. - [Madison] Really? What's your favorite book by him? - Well, I only read one, Ham on Rye. It was probably the best book I ever read. - That's a good one, but there are lots of others. I think his best books are his collections of short stories. - I'll have to read them. How's this one? - This is my favorite. - Really? - Yeah. It's got the funniest story about this guy who shrinks down to six inches, just for the pleasure of this woman. (laughing) - That sounds pretty creative. - Yeah, and this one has Hitler living in the present day. Actually, these stories come from his imagination and not his experiences, which is kinda cool because it makes it different from his other books. - I think if I ever wrote a book, it would have to be from my imagination. This is way more interesting than my experiences. - Why is that? - I guess it's because I do so few things to the fullest. - What do you mean? - Well, like when I'm snowboarding, that's all I'm thinking about, you know? There's a fresh dumping, laying down first tracks, I'm not thinking about what that girl thinks of me, or people nagging me, I'm just thinking about snowboarding. And other things, I guess it's because I don't have passion for 'em. I just don't seem to do 'em all the way, and I see myself doing them in my head, but when it comes down to it, I just don't do it. - Yeah, I know what you mean. I've been trying to get out of Mammoth for a couple of years now. I don't know, go see the world, meet new people, but life here's pretty comfortable. I make good money, I have fun snowboarding. I just can't, I just can't make that leap to go and do what it is I really see myself doing, you know? - [David] I would think Mammoth would be the best place to be and live. - Like I said, it's nice, but I've got traveling in my blood, you know? It's like, what if you had to go play for a team in Michigan? - What do you mean? - Well, you wouldn't get to snowboard. I mean, where you're going, you've got some of the best mountains in the world. - I'd have to be able to snowboard. It just means so much to me. - Course it does. - What if I never knew what it felt like to be 20 feet in the air, practically upside down, heart just pounding, just knowing I'm gonna stick it, and when I do, the rush of excitement and adrenaline. Like, I'm at the top of the mountain, and it's super steep, it's just this tiny little chute to get down in, heart's just pounding, 'cause you're scared shitless. Just being able to say fuck it and just go. (laughing) - You are so fucking sexy, Dave. You know what? I have to get up pretty early tomorrow. So you gonna come to bed with me? - Sure. - Dude, I can't believe you fucking scored with that hot bartender last night and I didn't get fucking shit, man. - Yeah, well, you know, I guess I've been saving up all my charm to unload on the hottest chick ever. - No, dude, Dave, seriously, bro, for once you didn't fucking pass out. For one time, bro, you didn't fucking pass out, - Ah, probably right, probably right. - How old was that chick, dude? - Dude, she's like 26, easy. - Get the fuck outta here, does she know how old you are? - No, I told her I was moving to Canada to play for some minor league hockey team up there. - Get the fuck outta her, bro, she believe that? - Yeah. - You fucking dog, bro, my boy, Dave, the dog. - You know it, man, I learned from the best. - Oh, true dat.
