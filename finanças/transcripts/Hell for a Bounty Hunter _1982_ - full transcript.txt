I want you all to vote for Jack, Jack Banister. He's a great mayor. Thanks very much! (crowd applauding) - Hey, Willy! When you're through with your back, just put the quarter on the plate, will you? I have an important council meeting. There you go. - [Mayor] Thank you, doctor. - And don't use all the hot water! I have more customers coming in later today. Okay.

Yes, sir. We're electing a new mayor, you know? Yeah. New mayor and we're gonna get ourselves a sheriff. Hey, the town is really growing. Yes, sir. We're proud of this little town. (crowd applauding) - Now, if I'm elected mayor, the sheriff will be someone who will take care of this county! - Hey, you ain't saying nothing we ain't heard before. - Well, this new sheriff will take care of this county and this city with law and order! (crowd applauding) - [Crowd Man] All right, yeah! - Oh, there you go. - You see that sign there? - Hey, besides all that good music, oh, feast on barbecue. Yes sir, pies, cakes, all that great stuff.

And, jeez, again, thanks, come back again! Wow! - As you all know, I was born in this territory. Born and raised right here in this county. And I love every foot of ground in it. And I will do everything in my power to see that law and order is the number one priority. Sure, we've had some progress but mostly from outsiders though. But don't forget who works so hard for peace. Yours truly, Jack Banister! (crowd applauding) Oh, that's not all. We're gonna have a new sheriff and we're gonna have law and order in Garwood County, how about that? (crowd cheering) Yeah, yeah! Yeah. And if I'm elected mayor-- - Maybe if he's elected, he'll give us what he promised us last time. - Yeah. (man laughing) I doubt it. - If I'm elected mayor, the sheriff will be someone that will guard this fair town and conduct law and order against ruffians. So this will be a place where our women folk and children can walk the streets in safety. Now remember, a vote for Jack Banister is a vote for law and order! (crowd cheering and applauding) Ladies and gentlemen, I want to introduce to you the captain of the brigade, Captain William Decker! (crowd applauding) How're doing, Captain. - Thank you. Folks, I've seen this town come from a prairie stop to a real town. You have your own railroad coming in now. I've known a lot of you people for a long time. Wilber, I brought the doc to your mom when she was having you. The judge has given me the honor to stay and oversee the election of your new mayor and a sheriff. I know you folks will elect someone that will serve you well. Thank you. (crowd applauding) (boots stomping) (door knocking) - Here's your new outfit, mister. Sorry I didn't have time to wrap it.

They're all leaving tomorrow. We're electing a new mayor. - Give me one card. - Hey, mister? Pretty fancy clothes you got on. (men chuckling) Why don't you try out for the job? (men laughing) You ain't no ranch hand. - There's gonna be trouble over there, Mayor. - Hey, cutie. (ominous music) - I said I could use one card. - Hey, mister. - Think you better help him, Bill? (glass shattering) - Jack, I think the young fella can handle himself. - I'm gonna cut that pretty face of yours all up! (suspenseful music) - [Masters] Don't do it boy. - I ain't no gun fighter, mister. - [Man] Steady now, stranger. - Put that gun on the bar. Pick up your friend and get him out of here. (people chattering) - Hey, stranger. Come on over. I'd like to buy you a drink. Floyd, another bottle for the gentleman. - [Floyd] Yeah, let's liven it up in here! (upbeat piano music) (upbeat harmonic music) - Long ride in the morning. It's getting late, election tomorrow. Think I'm gonna turn it in. See you in the morning. - Goodnight, Bill. - Goodnight, Captain. - How long you gonna be in town? - Just passing through, nothing to keep me here. - I don't know about that. I'm running for mayor tomorrow and I'd like to have you on the ballot as sheriff. - Good idea. - How much does it pay? - A hundred dollars a month and keep. Josh, here, will be your deputy. - Maybe I'll take you up on that, Mayor. - Folks, if I'm elected tomorrow, this gentleman here is going to be your new sheriff. (people cheering) All right, Floyd, drinks for everybody! Everybody! On me! (people cheering) - See you after the election, Mayor. (faint upbeat harmonica music) - Good morning, folks, glad to see you. Cast your ballots.

Get up in there. - [Masters] You sure are looking pretty today. - Why, thank you. - [Masters] Where would you like to go for our picnic? - I know a real nice spot down by the stream. - How are you, Wesley? - Sure a lot of people coming in for the election. - Well, it's a nice day for it. - Yep. (pleasant harmonica music) - [Woman] You know, Jack is sure to win the election. So that means you'll be sheriff before the day's over. - [Jake] Yeah. Well, I hope I did the right thing by accepting that job. - [Woman] Oh, I know you did, Mr. Masters. You showed up just when we needed you the most. - [Jake] I'm glad you feel that way. And I appreciate your confidence in me, ma'am. - [Woman] You know, when I'm with you, I've got the strangest feeling that I've known you for a long, long time. - [Jake] This is the place you had in mind, isn't it? - [Woman] Why, yes. This is my favorite place. How did you know? - Ah... Just a hunch, I guess. (pleasant harmonic music) (water trickling) You ever think about selling that place of yours? - What do you mean? Would you like to buy it? - No. Just seemed the other night when I was talking to you that you're looking for a change. - Why would you ask me a question like that? - I don't know. Maybe... If I get that job as the sheriff, you-- (sinister music) - Do you remember me? - No, should I? - Since you ain't packing no iron, (gun cranking) I'll give you time to think about it. (foreboding music) - Guess it's about time we get back to town. I have some business to take care of. Am I gonna see you at the dance tonight? - I'll be there. (people chattering) - Folks, the voting is over. In just a few minutes, the votes will be tallied and we will give you the results of the election. Sergeant? (crowd applauding) Take the saddles. - Yes, sir. Let's move out. (people chattering) - How many we have? How many voted? - 22. - 22 votes. - 22, huh? - Big turnout. - Hold it down, folks. I'd like to introduce you to your new mayor, the honorable Jack Banister. - Well now! (people applauding) Thank you, folks, thank you, thank you. I want to thank you for your confidence and I want you to know that I shall be the same to you as I was in the past. (people applauding) Yes. - What's the name of the new sheriff? - Jake Masters. - Masters? - Jake Masters. J-A-K-E. M-A-S-T-E-R-S. Good man, good man. - Congratulations. - Thank you, Roy, thank you very much. Okay, folks. Would you do the honors? (dramatic horn music) - Sergeant, move 'em out! Go! - Forward! Yo! (exciting horn music) (gunshot booming) (man laughing) (upbeat banjo music) (people chattering) - Okay, folks. Killing cowboys. Step right up, I wanna tell you about this brand new hand gun. The finest hand gun in the territory. You simply open up the door in the back and push the shells right in here. Okay now. Who would like to be the first one to try this handgun? Take over, boy. Do your job. - All right, who's the first one on the line? - Let me shoot that gun. - Be careful. (gunshot popping) - [Men] Woo! - Let me shoot this. (gun cranking) (gunshots popping) (people chattering) (silly band music) (gunshots booming) (people chattering) - [Henry] Hurry up, boy, let's get that meat on the fire. (pleasant band music) - [Mayor] You're gonna sell it, aren't you? - Yes, I have plans to do that, Mayor. - [Mayor] We're gonna miss you. - I think that's the best thing for you to do, Lilly. - Ma'am, do you mind if I have a dance with you later tonight? - Sure, Mr. Masters. - Thank you, ma'am. - Oh, say Sheriff. A moment, please. I'd like to have a few words with you. See that old man over there with youngsters? - Get your fingers out of that meat. - I'm just tasting it, Pa. - Don't be sassing! - I'm sorry, Pa. - They own a right nice piece of property outside of town. And what I want... Ah, I'll see you in the morning. My office. That'll be your first order of business. Now go and have a good time. Enjoy yourself!

Come on, everybody! Let's go! (pleasant band music) - Hey, Masters! I think I've given you enough time to remember. - What's this all about? - I don't have time to talk, just give me a gun. Are you sure you wanna go through with this, boy? - Just strap on that gun. Got balance and skill from my brother. Now do you remember me? (eerie music) - I've just been elected sheriff in this town and my job is to protect these people. And I can give you a chance to ride out of here clean. (man laughing) - It'll be the shortest office ever held in this territory. I'm gonna kill you, mister. (ominous music) (gunshot booming) (man screaming) (eerie music) - All right, you two fellas take him out of here. The rest of you, come on, let's go, let's go home. It's all over, let's go. Come on, everybody home. Come on. (foreboding music) (door knocking) Come in. - Morning, Mayor. - Morning, Jake. Sit down, make yourself at home. Remember last night, that business I told you I wanted you to take care of? - You didn't go into detail. - Well, that old man has a choice piece of land northeast of here. Beautiful. And he owes a lot of taxes. I mean a lot of taxes. But he's a stubborn old codger. So, if you lean on him, not too heavy, just a little pressure. (ominous music) - Are you asking me to run him out of there? - No, no, but you see, I can afford the taxes and he can't. And if thing works out all right, well there could be something in it for you. You see, this territory is really booming and there's opportunities for a young fellow like you. - Say it's northeast of town, huh? - Beautiful place. (ominous music) Go one, Jake. (eerie music) (rooster crowing) (cow mooing) - What're you gonna do, take all day on that windmill tire? - I'll get her done, Pa. - Tie that stuff down in that wagon good. - Okay, Pa. (somber guitar music) - What can we do for you, Sheriff? - Mayor sent me up here to collect some back taxes. - Jack knows we have no money now till we sell cattle. We have been through a drought, lost 50 head of stoke. - Well I didn't come here to hear any troubles. I came here to collect some money. - Be no money here. Not at this time, anyway. - Why don't you just go ahead and get yourself money? - Are you crazy or something? (ominous music) - [Boy] I'll get him, Pa! (boy yelping) (hooves clacking) (intense guitar music) (sinister music) - You aren't through with me yet, old man. I'll be back. - [Henry] Come on, Jeremy, help. Jeremy, come on. - Pa? I'm hurting, Pa. (foreboding music) (dog barking) (cow mooing) (ducks quacking) - Yah! (dramatic music) (metal clanking) Whoa. - [Man] What happened to him? - He's hurt! (boy coughing) - Oh my. Put him right up here. Careful. Here. Well. He's awful bloody. What happened? - The sheriff trampled him with his horse, Doc. - Are you sure it wasn't an accident? - Weren't no accident, Doc. Just reared back on his horse and kept kicking Mark till he couldn't move anymore. (Mark coughing) (dramatic music) - I don't know if there's much I can do for him. It's bad. - Doc, you gotta do something for my boy. Do it! - Mr. Hendricks, hold on, hold yourself. Your boy's lungs have collapsed. - You've gotta-- - There's not much I can do for him. In fact, there's nothing I can do for him. Mr. Hendricks? Mr. Hendricks? - Yes? - Your boy is dead. - You take care of him and make arrangements for Mark. - Yeah, Pa, I'll take care of him. Pa, where you going? - Never you mind, you take care of Mark. (dramatic music) (people chattering) (Mayor laughing) (ominous music) Jack, where's the sheriff? - I don't know. (Mayor chuckling) - [Henry] Jack, where is the sheriff? - I told you, I don't know. - [Henry] When you see him, you tell him I'm looking for him. He just killed my boy. (ominous music) - Mayor. Mayor, he's at the hotel. The sheriff's at the hotel. (ominous tempo music) - [Lilly] Did you kill that boy? - [Jake] What're you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. Hendricks' boy, he's lying over at the Doc's office. - It was just an accident. - The old man is gunning for you. - You lose a boy, you're bound not to be thinking straight. - Just because you think you own the town, don't mean you own me. (somber guitar music) - Mayor? - Yeah, Doc? - Mayor, I gotta talk to you. If you had seen what I just saw... It was brutal treatment that was given to that boy. Now something has to be done, Mayor. You gotta do something. (door knocking) - [Jake] Who is it? - [Mayor] It's Jack. Open up, it's important! - Come in. - What'd you do to the young Hendricks boy? - Jack, you get all riled up over nothing. - Was it an accident? - You could call it that. You know, boy raised in this country, you'd think he knew better than to run out in front of a horse. - The boy is dead and old man Hendricks is looking for you. And if I were you, I'd get out of town while the getting is good. - Now are you giving me some good advice, Mayor, or are you trying to tell me something? - No, just get out of town. - Jack, you just go get yourself another drink and leave that old man to me because we're partners now. Got it? Now get out! (metal clanking) (eerie music) (ominous tempo music) Nice story. - People got a right to know the truth. - In this town, mister, you're gonna write what I tell you to write. - I'll print my own headlines. - Okay, you do that. That little boy who's delivering papers, is that your boy? - Yeah. - Then I've got your next headlines, mister. "Newsboy Killed by Runaway Horse." You just print what you want, mister. Just print what you want. (ominous music) (metal clanking) - What can I do for you, Sheriff? - I want my horse. And... You don't know when I left or which way I went. Got it? - Got it, Sheriff. - And burn these. (foreboding music) - Boy, bring that horse now! (metal clanking) - [Jake] Whoa. (ominous music) (smooth beat music) - [Jeremy] Whoa. - Take them swirl rigs there and re-stay that fence up there. And I'll ride on up to the Divine place and see if there's anymore breaks. - Sure, Pa. (smooth beat music) - Yah! (exciting beat music) Yah! Yah! Come on! Come on! - That dumb old cow, she's done it again. (horse huffing) (eerie music) Damn old cow. That's just like old lady cow. (eerie music) (rocks crunching) (gunshot booming) (horse grunting) (exciting beat music) (ominous music) (gun cranking) - Go ahead and shoot. Get it over with. (gunshot booming) - That's too easy, old man. Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah! Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah! (sinister music) Go! (ominous music) (cart rattling) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Pa! Pa! Pa! (ominous music) Easy, Pa. Don't try to talk, Pa, I'll get you to town. (dramatic music) Come on, Duke, Daisy, yah! Yah! (faint saloon piano music) (unsettling music) - Deal me in. - Where you been? - You afraid I've found somebody else? - I saw you leave town. Where'd you go? - For a ride. - Doc, Doc! Come quick, old man Hendricks is sick! - Oh no. - Floyd! Give me another bottle. (somber saloon piano music) - [Doc] Bring him right in here, men. - [Josh] Easy now. Here. - Put him here, right up here on the table. (Hendricks groaning) Place him right up here. (gentle guitar music) - Is he gonna be all right, Doc? - Yes. Your pa's gonna be fine, son. He just had a mild stroke. - The sheriff did it. - What'd you say, Pa? - The sheriff did it. - What? I... I think I better go tell the mayor. (gentle guitar music) - Now where do you think you're going? - I'm going to see me a sheriff. - Now hold on, son. You're just fixing to get yourself killed. I told you, you're pa's going to be all right. - That sheriff of yours just about killed old man Hendricks. What're you gonna do about it? - What can I do about it now? I got problems clear up to my neck. - Jack, if you don't do something about it now, these towns people are gonna put a rope around that neck. - Is there trouble? - You're asking me? You oughta know. - Now, Jack, I can handle this job and finish it. - I want out. I don't wanna be hanging along side of you. (gun cranking) - Well you one ain't important anymore. And you're not gonna do anything about it. - Looks like you've got the winning hand in this game. - That's right, Jack. - [Mayor] What do you want me to do? - You just keep making out you're still the mayor. (people chattering) - He's just had a mild stroke. - I'll even the score for Mark. - Oh, coming awake, Mr. Hendricks. Yeah. Now open your mouth for me, please. Then stick your tongue out. Sure thing, tongue goes red. It's a mild stroke but you're gonna be fine, Mr. Hendricks. Everything's gonna be all right. - You tried to kill the old man! - Since when did you get morals? Give me those cards. - Sheriff? It's time you and me had it out. - Boy, if you try to kill me, I'll bury you right next to your brother. (eerie music) - I'll see you at the cemetery tomorrow after I bury my brother. - It isn't in the cards, boy. Tomorrow you better dig two holes. (eerie music) (dramatic guitar music) - Men, we're gathered here today to lay to rest the mortal remains of Mark Hendricks who was trampled to death by a horse. He was a fine young man and it's a shame that he never had a chance to get any older. Let us bow our head in prayer. (dramatic music) Dear Lord, take this boy's remains... (horse hooves clacking) From here on in into eternity. Amen. (ominous music) (gun cranking) (foreboding music) - Hey, boy. I thought I told you to dig two holes. - Pa, I gotta do what I gotta do. For Mark's sake. (ominous music) - Well I guess all the talking's done. - Bounty hunter! (gunshot booming) (man laughing) (sinister music) (men laughing) - What's happening? No! No! (suspenseful music) No! No! No! Yah! Yah! (suspenseful music) No! No! No! No! No, no! No! (horse hooves clacking) (eerie music) No. No! No!
