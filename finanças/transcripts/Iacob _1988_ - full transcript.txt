Matei Gheorghe... Troșca Vasile... Stefan Vasile... Grindu Vasile... Fotea Ion... Brad Ion... Ștefan Solomon... Ifrim Gheorghe... Radu Vasile... Get undressed! You and you too! You too! You too! The others, dismissed! Hello, ma’am! Hey, Jacob! It wasn’t me, a sack just fell. Watch your step or you’ll make your wife a widow again. It wasn’t me, Vasile! Must be Covaci’s curses! Watch out! It explodes. Take cover! Attention! It blows! - A fool isn’t fool enough until... - Forget about him! Were you there when they found him? No. They say they had to unglue him from the walls. I wasn’t there. I never stepped foot in his yard. As long as you get along... Why shouldn’t I? That’s how it is. Well… I remarried for my child! Engineer, sir! They’ve struck a lode! Where’s the bottle? You! My God... What the… You’ve lost your mind! Cover me! Take it upstairs yourself! Donʹt touch it till Monday! If they find out, I’m not gonna blow myself up, like Covaci. - I’ll cut myself. - Are you mad? If they catch me, you’re in it too. We’re partners! Hey… Onisia Jacob… Brad Viorel… Pop Iosif… You, get undressed! Stop Get undressed! Hey, you there, get undressed! Go to the left! And you? What are you staring at? Go! It’s Trifan. Come on in, it’s getting cold. How did you get in? - Through the backyard. - Close that door! - Why don’t you knock? - I came uphill. You taking a bath? Just a little. Come, sit down. Come! Good evening! What’s that on your head? What are you doing here? Why do you let her in? - Let her be. - She won’t even make a fire! I come home and find the house empty. The chickens are hungry. Don’t you have a home? Why do you keep coming here? Iʹm leaving. Go put a pot on the stove, do something! Leave her alone. - Do you hear me? - Yes! Yes, Iʹm leaving. - I don’t like walking alone in the dark. - Sure you don’t. Leave us, we’re busy. - The children, too? - Yes. What are you up to? I wanna steal some gold. Close that door! Don’t even think about it! Say God forbid! - Gold thieves are good guys, Iuliana. - Then become one! Well, it’s not for everybody. - Not everybody is able to steal? - They can. But not every common thief is a gold thief. Stealing gold is not thieving. - Sure, I’m the thief. - Leave us! Sit down. - Is she good to the kids? - Yeah. Well, if you all get along… and you get along… Since my wife left, I donʹt come along with this girl. It’s been two years since Covaci killed himself… Almost… - Had he been more patient… - Patient? If they start suspecting you, you’re finished. Poor devil, in his own house? - Have you weighed it? - I didn’t take it. - What? - I was afraid. - Youʹre crazy?! - I dropped it down. - No way! - You steal it or not, it’s the same thing. - How come? You’re finished. - Where did you drop it? - On the ladder. I bet you didn’t! Do you want me to swear or what? You are afraid of me, because I know. You make fun of me?... Popa! Listen… Popa Constantin! Hey, Ilarie! They suspect us all, don’t they? When they took me last spring, I had to stay on one foot all night. I donʹt steal. But I donʹt let them steal from me. You think youʹre paid for your work, do you? If you think they do, let them! Jacob, are you home? Yes, boss. Trifan is here too! - Tell them to take me home! - Stay here, you go with me. Shut up. Are you having a party? - We are standing like a stork, boss. - Stand, until I tell you to stop, damn thieves! Close the door! They are uneasy, tomorrow is a Sunday. Go home with them, get out of my sight! There will be only two guards in the whole mine... The mountain’s like a sponge. Hard to guard it. - One can get in. - That’s a job for a real thief. Not quite. Weʹll be all right, too. Vinj Gheorghe, are you home? Now he starts beating her. - Who wants to get in will get in, right? - Yeah, but I don’t want to. - You know all the entrances. - I know a few things… When Ilie Rosu starts patrolling, he starts beating her too. She deserves it. - What do you have to lose? Nothing, but I don’t want to be through what I’ve been anymore. Look, when he made me stand on one foot all night, I thought I was dying. Every time he fell asleep I put my foot down a little bit. That’s what’s eating me! I wanna put my fucking foot down, even if for just a little! The hell you do. How much could you take? A grain of gold… Can’t you see you’re doomed? They won’t let you make a move. Others may have taken a bit of gold. So what? - Have anything changed? Jacob, Vinj is beating her senseless! It’s his house, his woman. What can I do? Do what you like, I’m going. You know where to find me. Heʹs beating her because of Ilie Rosu. He said heʹd kill him. Why wonʹt he? How could one stab a cripple? Cripple, eh? He’s working his guts out in the mine, A bitch is a bitch... Thatʹs all she deserves. I donʹt like dynamite in the bowels. Itʹs up to you... - Whatʹs up? - Just talking. Talking about what? He didn’t help Covaci kill himself or making him living! - I don’t like him. - I do... - I don’t like his daughter either! - Why do you let her in then? You’ve just washed your hair. Do you wanna catch a cold? Stop bitching, damn you! You’re killing me! Hey, Vinj! Is that you? What’s wrong? Whistle! Stop working on Sunday, Jacob! It’s bad luck! - You’ll lose your fingers, boys! Big deal... Big deal? Itʹs big deal for your father, looking for you in hospital. Stupid kind of play. And you? What? - Just looking. What are you looking at? What’s there to see here? What’s with that hat on your top? - Youʹre looking quite... - Quite what? - You know… - I don’t know. You know, you know... - Come on, go home. - Why? - I’ll tell you if you wanna know. - No, I don’t want to, why? - How are you? - Who’s your father? - Why? Does he know you’ve stolen his carbide? Scram. Do you hear me? - Hello! - Hello, Ilie. - Trifan’s girl is all grown up now. - Sure… - We are getting damn old. - Yeah. Proofing your house? It’s getting cold. - How’s everything, good? - Good, yeah. - Cheers! - Cheers! You fucking prick! Hey, Trifan! A dame of hearts is eyeing him up. What is it, kid? What is it? - Hi! - Hello! How are you, Todor? Fine, just drinking. -You damn old fool! -Why am I a fool? Can’t you sleep or what? They poke about the load, or what? Nobody gets inside! What happened, did they steal it? What are you staring at? They stole the gold pocket. Good job! What are you looking at? Youʹre alone? I’ve just come in. Why aren’t you in teams of two? Yes, we do in a team. - Is this your point of work? - Yes. Take him away! You can check everything you want. - Why don’t you work around in teams? - We do, boss. We keep an eye on each other. - You do?... - We follow the rules, sir. - Who stole from the load? - I didn’t, boss! How could you suspect that? Search us! Get down from there! I didn’t steal, ma’am! Please, inspect us. Bring some lard! - Damn thieves! - You can’t watch everybody. - Speak louder! I don’t know anything, ma’am, I swear on my children’s lives! I believe you, but it’s your station. Go ahead, stuff yourself and spill your guts, you damn idiots! We sealed it on Saturday. It’s not my fault. If you don’t confess, we’ll show you the worse. This can’t go on. There are too many. - Did they take a lot of gold? - Why do you care? - Did you steal or not? - No, sir, I give you my word. Yesterday, I was in the colony all day. People saw me. I didn’t have time to come here. What are you hidding there? Out! - Out, I tell you! - Leave him alone. I’ve got kicked out. They transferred me to coal, to Catrina. - It’s three kilometres away. Onisia, do you wanna hear it from me or from him? - It’s coal, right? - No, still gold, at Cainele. It’s eight kilometres away! Six, if you take the shortcut under the cableway. I didn’t take it. Others got there first. We should’ve been there together. When I got there it was gone. - Itʹs over? - Yes, ma’am! Aspazia! Jacob, my boy, what did they do to you? - Who told you? - Veturia, Trifan’s daughter. Where did she know this? Fodor’s wife knows too. - Who told her? - I don’t know. Why don’t you let the key when you leave? Where are the children? Theyʹre not at home. - Where have you been? - They brought marmalade to the store. - And Aspazia? - She’s talking to Ilie Rosu. - Talking?! - Just talking. - Talking about what? - Asking him about you. She’s really scared. Good evening! Jacob! Listen, I’ve told your wife too. Don’t start with complaints and lawyers! It didn’t do for Covaci any good either! Go home! I’ll help you out somehow. Just don’t do anything stupid. I won’t steal, I’m not stupid. You’re the damn thieves! I didn’t steal anything. Don’t push me, I’ll go to all the courts in the world! Do you know who I am? Don’t make me… What does Veturia know? You worry about her? The man wants to help you. I don’t deserve to cross the mountains in the middle of winter. It’s six kilometres! Be glad it isn’t worse, do you hear me? - Three months pass in no time! - Go to hell! - Careful, your boot’s got a hole in it. - So what? He hasn’t helped anyone! First they tie you up, then they wanna help you. - Did you go to him? - He was passing by… Tell him to pass by during the day, when I’m underground. What kind of woman are you talking to men in the middle of the road? - People will talk! - About what? About what? He’s broken many marriages! Not only Vinj’s. He is out, not underground like me. -How do you know this? -You know it too. Don’t you dare! I won’t beat you, like Vinj, I’ll kill you. Are you crazy? - I had to ask, hadn’t I? - No. - Are you upset with me? - How did you know? You’ve met Aspazia. Don’t you hear me? Has your father told you? Who told you? - Ilie Roșu... I knew it. Where are you going so early? I’ll tell on you! I don’t care. - Don’t you feel lonely walking that way? - Good one! Go home! If I feel lonely, I’ll tell you. -Hello. -Hello. - Hard to mount uphill, right? - Well… - Trifan who? - The guy with a green hat? - Yeah. He’s no longer at Catrina. They took him to Targu Jiu. - When? - Two days ago. - What? They searched us both yesterday. - Then maybe last night. Want some soap? - How much? - Six. Last night, when? I went to sleep at nine. - Maybe they took him afterwards. - It’s too expensive… When? I saw his daughter in the morning. She didn’t say anything. I’ve heard there is an investigation. Something about his wife. She denounced him, he beat her… - His wife? She ran away four years ago. - His daughter maybe. - I don’t believe it! - Boss, do you buy some soap? - Show me. - Six lei… - Why this moving off? - Just for nothing. Maybe Ilie Roșu fix an eye on his wife. Thatʹs just like him. I’m telling you, she’s run away. She was all skin and bone anyway. Well, skinny or not… - How long is your way home? - About three hours. If one work in the open, he could be crippled all right. -Aspazia! -Is that you? - Has anyone come looking for me? - No, who? - They took Trifan. - Yes… -Do you know this from him? -From who? -Ilie Roșu!- No, everybody knows. - Saveta told me, ask her. - Swear! - I swear. Why? - I saw his daughter in the morning. She didn’t say anything. - Whose daughter? - Trifan’s! - At four o’clock in the morning? - Yeah. - You didnʹt tell me! - When could I tell you? What was she doing at four o’clock in the morning? Not my business. What if they asked her to sound me? What’s she always doing in here? Draught! Close the door, mom! - What are you afraid of? - They took him, they’ll take me too. Why? Maybe there is an investigation or maybe he told them something… - What does he know about you? There’s another entrance, near some rocks. I told him I knew. He could tell them all kinds of crap. How many know about this ? Be quiet! - Apparently, she denounced him. - About what? About what he’s got there and what he knows… Go see! Move! - See, they fight all day long. - Is that so? Yes, it is. - What did Uncle Ilie bring you? - Who? - Ilie Rosu… - What did he bring me? - Was he here? - No. - And your mother? Where did she go? - I don’t know. Mom! - Was she at home? - I don’t know. Mom! There’s nothing to be afraid of. You are not involved. - I called the mine director a thief. - When was that? Yesterday. I said it to Ilie Rosu. No, you said other crap. Come on, put the finger there! Veturia! - I didn’t know, I wasn’t home. - Where were you? At Aunt Mary’s. I helped her slaughter a pig. - Cause he beats me. - So what? He beats me the way he beat mom. And do you like finding the house empty? Damn him! Itʹs your father, donʹt talk like that? Are you lying to me? - Where were you last night? - I told you! - Veturia, if you lie to me… - I wouldn’t lie to you. If you lie, I don’t know what I’ll do to you. - You can’t harm me! - No? You’re a good man. How can you disrespect your father like that? I feel no pity for him. - Who took him away, Ilie Rosu? - No. - How do you know? - I asked him. Is that so? Aren’t you talking to each other a lot lately? - So? We are relatives. - So what? - He’s my mom’s cousin. - Does he stop by your house? Mother’s gone, why would he stop by? - Careful what you say! - He won’t harm me. - How do you know that? - Heʹs Okay... - Ask Vinj about this. - Vinj is a jackass. Why, because Ilie Rosu broke his marriage? - Maybe I’m a jackass too. - You? - Do you know anything? - No, what is there to know? About Aspazia… Do you know anything or not? No. - Can you find out? - We’ll see. Aunt Aspazia? How the hell can we wash? Need some soap. I’ve got mud even in my navel. - Otherwise how would you know you’ve got a master? Theyʹd better give me some soap... You might get one from Santa! Just be a good boy and wait. Seal it correctly. Do it well. Hey, what are you doing? - Did you pay a good price for those? - I went to sell them, but I couldn’t. - So you’re taking them back home? - Since there’s no buyer… - Carry them on cable! - That would be good. - Good-bye! - So long! Good evening! It’s freezing! - What are you doing here? - Nothing. - Why are you wandering around? - Who, me? - I was just passing by. - You are waiting for me? What do you want? A young wife is enough. - I don’t want anything. Let me go! Why are you waiting for me? - Do you wanna tell me something? - No. - Do you know anything? - No… - Anything about my wife? - No! Good for your dad beating you. Each blow makes something to grow up. Come on, go home! Go home, kid! Won’t we save some for charity? - For whom? - Someone, you know... - Trifan’s daughter maybe… - No! Hey, what is it? Go to bed! Put them to bed! Don’t stay here, getting on my nerves. Everybody has something to give on Holidays. So? Each to his own. - Poor girl, she’s all alone now. - She’s not the only one. Some got crippled in the mine. Why not help a cripple man? What shall we do on Christmas? Want to buy half a pig, or not? Give her something if you want. I have nothing to hide. What have you got against him? He’s no gold thief, Trifan, poor bastard. - Who said he was a gold thief? - You joked together… - Me?! - That you’d become thieves or something. You said it and I crossed myself. - Me? - Yes, you. - She’s lost her mind! - My goodness! - Aspazia, did he say it or not? - Don’t you ever say that again! Not even in your sleep! Go put the hens in the pen and unleash the dogs! - Don’t yell at my mother! - He’s nuts! Just listen to what she’s saying! So, are we buying some pork? Christmas is here and we haven’t got a bit of pork. - Maybe mother will get some. - How? Fortune telling… Don’t you dare bring over all the hags in the village! I’ve had it! I’ll shove your cards down your throat! Raving mad! Now, what? At least buy a quarter of pig. Donʹt worry. A weak passed and nothing happened. That’s what I’m afraid of. - So will you buy some pork? - Only if we don’t buy boots. - Boots?! - For the kids… They break one pair a month! There are two months left to the next year... - Onisia Jacob! - I’m here! Hold on a second! - Good evening! - Evening! - Come on inside! Have a drink! - We’re on duty. Come on, I’ve just got my salary. - Some other time… - There might not be another time. You’ve got a red nose, girl. They take you home? Come in, for a minute. Go inside, you’ll catch a cold. OK, good night then. They wouldn’t come in, the bastards. Leave them alone! What’s your problem? A thief might look like me or like fucking anyone else! He could enter the mine with you and you have no idea. Nobody’s seen them or caught them. They came after dark… Not my business, I’ve got kids to raise. Wait, I can keep up with you. Go home, you’ll freeze. No. - What about the other thing? - What other thing? - Ilie Rosu… - I don’t care about your affairs. - Wait, girl… - Have I asked you anything? Don’t get angry! If it were my wish, but it isnʹt... What is it, are you crying? What happened, tell me! What’s wrong? Hush now. You aren’t crying because of me, are you? You’ve no one to talk to, right? Here, blow your nose. Veturia! You are an angel! Get away from here! Leave, do what your mother did! Why don’t you use one of these? I’ve been thinking about it, but... If it topples over, you’ll fall like a rock. Or if anyone notices you, youʹre finished. Go now! Someone could see us. Veturia, are you crying again? Come back, Veturia. - Are you coming out? - Go ahead. I’m coming. - I’m not going without you. - Why not? That’s the rule. We go in pairs. - Come on... - Wait a minute! Sit here. Somebody could see you. What the hell? What did I do? For the money they pay us… Do you want some cabbage pickle? No. Go ahead, throw it away. Have some booze! - No, thank you. - Are you crazy? - I don’t drink in the mine. Have some! Nobody’s gonna smell you. I told you, I don’t drink. - Why are you so proud? - I’m not. I want a clear head, that’s all. What did you do back there that you have to be so cautious? I didn’t do anything. You must have done something, you are too cautious. You sound me? Cut it out! You’re afraid, are you? You are afraid they’d take you out of this prison and put you into another. You’ve got used to this one. Jacob, you must live your life! Damn it! Come on, I’m not going out alone. Good evening! - Are you in the night shift? - Yes. You are here and your husband is all alone. Good evening! - Where’s your mother? - She went to buy milk. - When did she leave? - Trifan’s back too. - How do you know that? - I saw him. When? - At noon… - Bring your mother home! Get that out of her mouth. Shush, now! My little baby’s got scared. Come now! Daddy’s stupid and has cold, dirty hands. Daddy’s little girl, shush now! Wipe her! They’ll leave soon. Now, let’s see your future, you, the younger one. - When did you arrive? - Just now. - Aren’t you in the second shift? - Am I too early now? -Did something happen? -Not now… Lay the table, I’m starving. Take off your boots! Help your father! It feels good. Trifan’s back... Why don’t you stay home? What if somebody comes looking for us? - Who told you about Trifan? - Everybody knows. - How come I don’t? - Somebody must have told you too. - Who? - Come on… She’s even come looking for my mother. Why? - You don’t know, do you? - No. Mother sent her away. Come here! What is it? - Good night! - Good night. Go now. You! I’ll show you when you get back! What if the girl is their snitch? What if she’s supposed to get into my house, to see what’s going on? Your mother sends her away when Trifan just got back! Who knows what she tells him? That I’ve got gold maybe! What gold? Just saying. I don’t want her to suspect anything! I don’t want any suspicion. Give her money, I don’t care! Donʹt need any annoyance. What are you crying for? Come on, Aspazia, come now… - Do you think the children don’t get it? - Get what? Leave me alone! I’m just trying to do everything right, I do my best. - That’s all I can, OK? - Poor you! -Are we good? -We are… - I’m going. - Where? - Wanna ask him… - What? Why did they take him away? - Shouldn’t I ask him? - Are you conspiring again? Who, me? They are watching him, right? Do you really wanna go there? I need to know, OK? What’s with you two? What secrets could you have? Go ahead! But make him tell you the truth! - Can’t a man trust anyone? - Go! I’m going. - Where is this from? - Ilie Rosu. - How come? - It’s the left foot, as good as new. We’ve got one more left foot. It’s charity. The soles are good. Use it for the children’s shoes, - …or maybe it they fit you... - What about him? He wanted to do some good. We must help each other, right? Did he simply come here? What did he say? He gave them to Mihai, not to me. - Did you bring them? - He saw me and he called my name. Is that so? Why do you have to talk to everyone? Do you accept charity from the first person in the street? Don’t you have boots? Why? I’ll beat the crap out of you! - Don’t hit him! - Get out! Why did you take them? What did I tell you? Don’t I work hard enough? Do you want to kill me? I’ll just drop dead some day by some fence somewhere and you’ll be left begging! - Leave him alone, Jacob! - You are not his father! Go untie the dog, stop nagging me! - Where are you going? - You’re killing me. Jacob, my brother! Isn’t your left boot a bit tight? Sit down. I reckon your left boot is too tight. Have a drink! Get out! I’ll have a word with you too. I don’t want to, OK? What’s this, a party? Please, stay here! I didn’t think you’d get angry. People working outside are livelier, eh? - Or what? - Don’t get angry! Christmas is coming. He’s lively, eh? He’s got no fucking silicosis like the other fools. Miners live underground, they have no time to commit sins. - You think I’m a fool? - The boots were for your kids. - Will you just go or not? - No. - Just go away! - Stop pushing me. Why don’t you take her home? What are you doing here? - Go home! - I don’t want to. - Don’t you hear me? - Take it easy, don’t push her. What do you want? - Did I come to your table? - What do you want? Trifan, feel like leaving again? Go, Veturia. - Just look at her! - Go home, don’t stand here! Don’t touch mom! I’m asking you, why are you taking me for a fool? Take care of your own children! And I’ll take care of mine. Stop using my kids! Why taking me for a fool? Fine, you’re the smart one. We’ll see about that. - So, youʹre stupid?... - Ilie!… Like a gold thief. in the day-time. Not my business. I’ve got children to raise. That’s all we do: eat, work and raise children. - Hush... - That’s all we do. God help us it won’t get worse. Listen, do you know who I am? I mind my own business. Sure you do, with that fine young wife of yours. - She’s not so young! - Yes she is. What’s gotten into you? - Where are you going? - The kids are waiting. Your kids? Then forget about booze. You, at home! At least your wife’s young... - Ilie… - What a fucking life! Sure, you think you’re some big shot, don’t you? Hey! You! Go home! Come here! I say, come here! You’re all wandering around. Get in the cage! - Why are you beating him? I feed him, I want to hear him barking. Keep him in his chain! He wanders around. - Did he come while I was at work? - Who? - Ilie Rosu, of course. - No, what for? - Swear to me! - What’s wrong with you? Jacob! He’s got his eye on you. Say something! Good Lord! Saying that in my own house? That damn girl came to me to save her. I send her away. - Who? - Trifan’s daughter.Venturia. What? Save her from what? She’s pregnant. What? That’s not my business. Get inside. - When did she come? - I told you and you ignored me. Ignored you? Don’t change the subject! Don’t play with me. - He came to you before as well, right? - Before what? Before your man killed himself. - Before… I’m talking about Ilie Rosu. - Stop yelling! - I don’t know… No! - Are you sure? - What’s the matter? - Get the hell out of here! You woke up the baby. Everybody, wake up! Perform! Come here, on the double! Get up, it’s your father… If he comes when I’m in the mine... Shut up or I’ll kill you! Listen! I’m warning you. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. I’ll cut you all, do you understand? - Look at him ! -Are you drunk or what? Did you hear me? I didn’t take you, a widow with two children, and your mother in, to drive me crazy! I’ll find out if he comes. - What would he come for? - You. - How do you know that? - He implied it. When, now? Stop eavesdropping! Go to bed! What are you looking at? All you do is gossiping! Shut up! - Have you talked earlier? He tried to test me. - Test you how? - To see if I complain. Fucking delator! What could I cavil about? There’s no soap, the usual stuff. I complain like you or her. How can I know what the crazy hag blabs out? What can I complain about? Maybe Trifan told them I knew an entrance to the mine. But he didn’t say a word. He waited for me to say something. Stop worrying so much and go do something. Go talk to Trifan. Do something! If it’s too short, tie it in a knot! Take the guns to the gun rack on the cliff! - How long have you known about this? - I’ve just found it. Yesterday, Fodor’s heifer got lost, so… Iacob, think about it. There should be another one. I don’t know, sir. I only found this one so I’ve showed it to you. - Try to remember! - There is nothing to remember, ma’am. - Try to remember! - I’ve told you, I… - How are we going down? - The same we came, by foot. - Is it true they’ll cut our wages, sir? - Who told you that? - I don’t think so. - People talk. Come on, if they do, nobody will get underground no more. Who told you? What the hell is this? It was working fine. - Hey! - Keep yelling! Hey, whatʹs up there? Is it raining or what? Get closer to the wall. - What is it? - It’s a man’s blood! - Stop it! - Stop the cage! Hey! Stop the cage! It’s coming from above. - What’s going on up there? - Stop it or you’ll kill us all! - Something must have collapsed. Youʹre smashing us all! Don’t jump! Cut it out, there is no time! - Make it stop! - I can’t! - Stop it! - Shut up! - Don’t jump, are you crazy? - Stop it! - Stop it, are you crazy? - Take it easy. If they don’t stop at the first stop, I’ll blow you to pieces! I’ll blow you all to pieces, all at once! What did he say…? Who…? - How was it? - OK. What are you doing here? What’s wrong, tell me! Can’t you hear me? What’s wrong? Go back inside! If I had died today in the cage, would you have cried like this? What are you looking at? What do you want from me? Do you want to unglue me from the walls too? - You’ll wake up the kids… - Can’t I have a quiet Saturday evening? Can’t I? Did anyone stop by? Hello! Hello there! Go take your coat! Hey! Did you donate for the dead man from Cainele? Yes, we did, sir. Is it true they’ll cut our wages? Is it true they’ll cut our wages? - Why’s that? You steal too much. - The wages won’t be cut, right? - Sure. How about we bring the gold from home, sir? You will do that too… Bring what? We’ll bring everything from home, tools and our wives too! We must get a full wage somehow. - Trifan… - My respects, engineer! I work at Catrina, the coal mine. It hasn’t got more expensive yet. Kiss your bossʹ ass because he’ll kiss yours some day. That’s enough, you’ve passed the sign. It’s OK. Fuck him and his glasses. He’ll find himself cut some time... Careful not to stab your ass instead. You hold your knife like you hold you shovel. - What do you want? - Nothing. I get off the coal at Catrina. I don’t want anything. - Heʹll get some trouble... - Who, Trifan? No, the engineer. Why not? - I think he is stirring people. - How? - Didn’t he tell you anything? - What? I work at Cainele. He said this and that, that things aren’t good… - What things aren’t good? - What things are good? If it keeps snowing, we’ve worked in vain. We’re left with nothing. What wage is that? - You get as much as you ask for. - And how much do you ask? I don’t ask anything. I’m fine with leftovers. God forbid we lose those too. - Hello! - Hello… - How are you? - Fine. How much did they pay you for showing them the gap? Youʹre a silly ass. I want to talk to her. - You talk only to me! - What could we talk about? - Is it true? - Talk to me! - Wanna fight already? It’s early. - Talk to me! The old woman told me you visited her. - It’s not your business. - Don’t say another word! - Talk to me! - Hold your horses! - I wanna know. - What for? Shut up! Don’t say a word! - That’s it. They pay us little, but we can work even less! Gold thieves in the mine! Gold thieves in the mine! There he is, Santa Claus… Gold thieves! - Come on, get in the car! You too! - It’s Sunday, Iʹm sorry! I do coal, at Catrina! - Todor, get in! - I have nothing to hold on to. Whoever comes gets a 300 lei bonus. They’ll steal your gold, careful! If you see them, tell them to come steal from me too. I don’t mind. - Shut up! - Hey, listen… You talk like an idiot. They’ll steal everything from you. You won’t catch them! Not a single one! - Watch your mouth! If you catch one, I wanna see him. They’ll take everything from you! And after this, I’ll show you my knife. I won’ tell you when!... Wait… Turn yourself in! There he is! Stop! Come on! There! I’m exhausted. Fuck them! Wait! Don’t move! - Stop! Don’t move! -No, no! It’s me, Jacob! It’s me! Down! Get down! Watch out! Who’s got matches? What matches? - What are you doing there? - I’m slipping, help me! I’m slipping! It’s no use. They won’t catch them. Theyʹve never caught anyone. Where is Ion, Mogos Ion? Vlad Ilie! Mogos Ion! Through the call room! You must be all searched! Hey, go through the call room! Matei, the searching! Nobody gets out! The searching! Popa Constantin! I’m fed up with your searching! Have you got a lamp? Jacob! -Iosif! -I’m coming! Nobody gets out! Itʹs a searching! Mother! Nobody gets out without being searched! Jacob, your best clothes! Christmas is in a couple of days... Don’t worry! Be patient. Nobody can take your patience away from you. - There’s not much left. - I’m just looking, I canʹt bind my eyes. She’s in front of me. - Arms up! - Is she really pregnant? - Yes. With Ilie Rosu. - That’s a lie, Aspazia. - What’s a lie? - They are relatives. - No they aren’t. - Let’s get out of here! Tell me it’s not true! Do you hear me? Tell me it’s not true! Of course it’s not true! - Aren’t you the one? - Me? He doesn’t want complicate with a spoiled brat like her! How do you know what he wants? I’ve warned you, haven’t I? Now why are you crying? Come on, let’s go! It’s Christmas, let’s be merry. Don’t you have a home? There’s no circus here! Come on! - Come on, Jacob, take a break! - Mind if somebody’s not watching you. Don’t make them richer! Have a drink! Thanks, but I don’t drink here. - Why not? - It’s Christmas tonight. - Maybe later. Donʹt be silly. Do you drink again? Come on, Todor, we slaughter the pig tonight. - My respects, engineer! - Do you know the rules or not? - Come on boss, it’s Christmas. Please, boss! Careful, somebody could see you. Jacob, have a sip! - Cheers! - Cheers! We aren’t too cheerful… Donʹt talk about this. - It feels good. We bought half a pig. -Who’s preparing it? -My wife. - When will you get home? - Only after midnight. That’s not good. Why don’t you move closer? - I can’t. - Why not? There’s a colony here, Brazil. Some folks wanted to go to Brazil, but they didn’t make it. - Is your wife young? - Not so young. - The wolves will eat you one night. - I donʹt think so. - How long have you got left? - One month. - What if they leave you here? - It’s impossible. - Don’t they have anything on you? - No, they don’t. There must be something. There must be something. You gave them the pit. - They’ve got nothing on me! - Where did you get that? - Over there! - Give me four whirligigs! - The hell with the mine for two days! - Where are you heading to? - That way… Merry Christmas! Good luck! Jacob, bring me some of your sausages and I’ll bring you some of mine! Couldn’t you find a better time? God forbid! No! It can’t be! No! Hello!... They stopped it for Christmas. For two days! Hey, is anyone there? Hey! Oh, fuck! Come on, start! I’m freezing… Let’s make a little fire… Come on! Some patience… Come on! Start! It’s good at least it didn’t stop in the valley. Hey! Someone! Maria… Maria, Mihai… Maria, Mihai, Aspazia... Veturia… Mihai, Aspazia, Veturia… Mihai, Aspazia, Veturia… Dumitra… Aspazia! Aspazia! It’s not that high… Maria, Mihai…
