"Radio: O Lady with a bun hairstyle! Come near me" "Come near me!" "O Naughty boy! You have come to play pranks with me, Come near me" "Come near me!" "I look at your slender hips" "You are wasting your time..." "There is no such thing as Love. Leave me" Drink. Do not stare only at the photos. Read the content. [motorbike approaching] Why are they coming here?! They may be having some reason. Why should I bother? Ask them. Hey! [birds chirping] Greetings Sir! Who are Marudu and Mari here? What is the other person's name? Yes...Murugesan. Where are they? Sir! Why are you asking? Will you tell only if I say the reason? Where are those three? Tell. They are rogues. And you have come in search of them. Have they committed some serious crime? Yes. They helped a girl and a boy to elope from this place yesterday night. Girl's relatives complained to Police and are behind us. So we want to enquire them. Tell me where they are. I guessed they must have done like this. They were here. They were drinking tea and murmuring something to the tea vendor. Yes Sir. It is true. Do you know something? The tea vendor and those boys have some link. Ask him in a proper way and he will answer. Why are they pointing at me? They may be talking about my tea! Possible. -Hey! -Yes Sir. They said you are associated with the 3 rogues Marudi, Mari and Murugesan. Where are they? They have caught me! He is so arrogant! He is not answering us and is busy with his work. We know that you have links with those boys. Speak the truth. Otherwise you will be beaten to death. Alas! [tongue twisting] Why are you staring at the road and not answering me? Are you kidding? Sir! You were speaking to them just now. You allowed them to escape and are pestering me. What?! Yes Sir. They are the 3 boys you were searching for. Go and catch them. They do not allow me to run my shop in peace! Hey! Sir! Has he shown the right persons to you? He belongs to our village. He will surely pinpoint us. I am Marudu. He is Maari. And he is Murugesan. Are you playing tricks with the Police? Will skin you all. Wait there. You have found us. Now catch us if you can. Hey! Listen. Do not run. [panting] Don' run. I am panting. Hey! Come... Stop. I can't run. -Come. -Stop! I am asking you to stop. -Come. -My leg is sprained. -As if you can catch me otherwise! -Do not run. I am not running. Just walking. You cannot run the shop peacefully so long as we are here. -Sir! Save us. -Who are they? Please save us. [panting] Who are you? Why are you running? Two rowdies are chasing us since morning. Please save us. Why are the rowdies chasing you? Don't know. We are students. You should only help us. Okay. Go and sit there. I will take care. Stop it! I said I will handle it. Why are you still crying? We are scared. Promise that you will save us. Will hit you. How dare you ask a Policeman to promise you? Stop it! You want me to promise. Right? If anyone comes to beat you, I promise on Goddess Kali that I will thrash him and put him behind bars. Are you satisfied now? Go and sit. Say with a smiling face. Do not cry. [background wireless phone online] Hey! Are you all here?! Stop. I will catch you now. Wait. Wait. You went in the morning to catch 3 boys but have returned only now. Where are those 3? They are here. -What are you saying? -Yes Sir. You said two persons are chasing you since morning. Who are they? It is them. You said something about 'rowdy'. What about that? They are these two persons. How dare you complain about Police and also accuse them? You should be put behind bars. -Constable! Put them behind bars. -Yes. Lock them up. [laugh] Sir! Please do not take hasty decision. You are talking sarcastically. You promised on Goddess Kali. Now if you go back on that, you will lose your eyesight. Lose my sight! What are you saying? Goddess Kali is very ferocious. Why are you hesitating? Hand them over to me. I will handle them. Will you please shut up? This man is pestering me to find out his daughter! Is she with me?! Sir! Honor is very important to us. Hand these boys over to us. We will thrash them in such a way that they will blurt out the location of the girl. What shall I do now? Yes... They are right. I cannot beat them. I have promised them. Give a written statement and then take them. -What is happening here? -Be quiet. -Do not speak while we are talking. -Come. Let us go. Come. I took transfer to this place because I could not manage in my previous posting. But these people are more troublesome. Do not underestimate us. Even we can dance. See our dance. Everyone should know that we are celebrating here. Play music. "The sound of the drum" "and musical instrument is rhythmic" "Our town is the foundation" "of our country's culture." "Girls here still wear anklets" "and apply henna to their hands" "Our town has still not changed" "We are aroused when we see the girls here with their traditional dresses" "No need to spend money for admiring the girls" "This enjoyment is free of charge. Enjoy it" "God has not created any girl without beauty" "Every girl here is a beauty" "The sound of the drums" "and musical instrument is rhythmic" "Our town is the foundation" "of our Country's culture." "Our lands is very fertile" "We provide food to everyone" "We fight to get water released in our River" "We are the ones who protect this Country" "Our place is famous for showing affection and courage" "Is there anyone like us?" "Many temples here..." "And lots of festivals to enjoy." "No other place has all of these" "We are brave people of Chola dynasty" "And our valor reaches the sky." "The sound of the drums" "and musical instrument are in rhythm" "Our town is the foundation" "of our Country's culture." "No person is alone here" "Everybody around him are his relatives." "People here serve food with affection" "You cannot see such affectionate persons anywhere" "Martial arts" "And Folk dances are" "the identities of our village." "We pray to God without" "Discriminating amongst castes." "We celebrate festivals together." "We are brave people of Chola dynasty" "And our valor reaches the sky." "The sound of the drums" "and musical instrument are rhythmic" "Our town is the foundation" "of our Country's culture." "The sound of the drums" "and musical instrument are in rhythm" "Our town is" "the foundation of our culture" [laughing] Do not laugh loud. People here will thrash us if they come to know. As if they can! Even the Police were helpless. What will these people do to us? Okay... But the bride and groom have still not come. Marudu has gone to bring. He will surely bring them. Keep quiet. Come on... Hop on. Problem will ease after some time. Come back after one year. It is getting late. Go. Okay. Who is that? What are you doing after switching off -the transformer light? -I will take care. You go. -Who is that? -Be careful. Why are you taking her? Where are you taking her? They are going to get married. Why are you shouting instead of blessing them? Go away. You are Chellathayi's son. Right? I know you. I know you. I have heard about your atrocities when I was in Dubai. Is it? -Now that I have come back, I will not spare you. -Wait and see. -Do whatever you want. -Go away from here. -Wait and see. Please do not commit suicide. [cat meows] Will hit you! I will break your leg if you come near the dried fish. I saved money with great difficulty, bought fish and dried them to sell. But everyone wants to grab it. You are drying fish here. But your son has been blamed for sending Murugesan's daughter and Kathiresan's son out of this village. He is now standing as accused in Village Court. Are you not going there? Whenever anyone elopes with a girl, my son is blamed for that and produced before the Village Court. Wait. I will put an end to this today. Why are you always appearing before the Court? You never listen to us. Tell us where you have sent the girl and the boy. Tell me if you are prepared to ask for pardon in this Court. Otherwise... Do you think they are going to tell the fact? To hell with your Enquiry! These boys have no other work. This happens every month... And there is a crowd to watch it. Move. Why is she coming here? -Move! -Why is she dashing against us? Greetings! What is happening here? Why have you assembled here and why have you accused my son? Look! Your son's behavior is not alright. Neither you are warning him nor do you allow us. You tell some excuse every time and take them away. We will not release them this time. We have an eye witness this time and so we have called him for enquiry. Eye witness! Who is that? Please do not stare at me. Will I blame your son? It is the work of The Dubai-returned fellow. How dare you speak against my son because you have earned some fast bucks? I saw your son sending them. Did you see my son sending them? With your eyes?! Okay. Tell correctly where your wife is standing amidst this crowd. Speak with respect to my husband. Otherwise I will cut your tongue. Of course I will speak in the same manner, You whore. You will be shamed if I disclose your activities while your husband was away in Dubai. We have lots of problems in our house. Why are you wasting time here? Come home. Such persons come to speak about Justice! She cannot bring up her son properly. But speaks about Justice! Who is that lady murmuring in this crowd? Oh! Is it you? Don't I know about your son? You were boasting that your son works in City. But he brought a girl along with him when he came back. All of you listen to this. She is another man's wife. [spit] Do not speak wrongly about my daughter-in-law. I will kill you. Can you kill me? Try to do. Hey... Did you hear her? [indistinct crowd chatter] She is disclosing everyone's private matters. -Now she has started talking about you. -About me?! Yes. Before she shames you, better close the enquiry. Stop it! I said, 'Stop it'. Henceforth if anyone comes to my house complaining about these boys I will break their limbs. -You may leave the place. -Go away. We will handle you in the next enquiry. Go away. -Come back home soon. -What she is saying? Come on. [hen clucking] Why are you fasting since morning? It is not good for you. Go. Wash your face and come to eat. You and your daughter do not know anything other than food. I am saying that I want to study. Why don't you understand? How can I tell your father to send you to study? It is difficult. Take your daughter's help. Let your uncle come. We will discuss about it. [motorbike approaching] What happened to my dear girl? Why is she crying? You ask her about it. I want to go to College and study. My classmate Kavitha has joined College. But nobody in our house is allowing me to study. You please explain to them. That's all! Are you crying for this reason? Okay... Wash your face. I will take care. Uncle! You will go to College from tomorrow. Right? -Really? -Yes. [cow mooing] The pregnant cow is mooing. Give some water to it. [cutting] Wonder when the Doctor will come to give injection to it! [motorbike approaching] [splash] Did she come to you for recommendation? She wants to study. Let her join College. No need. I cannot send a grown up girl outside and wait for her safe return everyday. They also get spoiled. Didn't our neighbor girl who joined College elope with some guy? Such things do happen. But we should not misjudge our own daughter. Suppose she gets married to an educated person, she will be in difficulty if she has no wordly knowledge. -What will happen then? -I am not saying for that... You do not know anything. Keep quiet. Brother-in-law! Let her go to College. I will take care. -You go. -Thanks, Uncle. Dear! I heard your scooter goes missing often. Do you know something? He gets back his scooter automatically. [laugh] You only steal it. How can someone else keep it back? This scooter was given to me during my marriage. But it remains idle because I cannot ride it. You may steal my scooter. But please do not take away my wife in haste! Don't worry. We will not take her away. Prepare tea. [song on radio] He seems to be better than these two! Ayyanar![glass shatters] -Why did you scream? -What sort of a song are you playing? Same one which I play always. It is not proper. Come. Let us play a good song. Play some good song. [radio crackle] Do not turn it awkwardly. I have pasted it with a tape. It may break. [pat] Be careful. Listen to this song. Hello! Hello! I am calling you. "O Bright night! Space in daylight!" "Speak to me, My Dear" "O Falling star! O lightning like girl" "You are a real beauty" "I will lean on your bosom and live my life" You are a rogue. Why are you sitting here and smoking? Get up and move to that side. "I have fallen in love with you" "Come to me, My dear" I am telling you. Don't you realize? Get up and move aside. "I love you, my dear" "We are made for each other" "Cannot live without you" "O My love" "Shall I give my life for you? My love!" What are you doing? We will get whatever we ask for if we pray to this God. I could join college because I prayed to this God. "I will change into a mirror" "And will reflect only your figure in that" [music] [engine reviving] Damn it! [panting] You have betrayed me. Shit![bump] What are you thinking? You said the girl you saw in the bus was very beautiful. I am thinking which place she belongs to. She not only looks beautiful. She also speaks beautifully. 'You are a rogue!' She attracted me with just one word. I don't mind to which place she belongs to or whose daughter she is. I will search her and express my love to her. Buddy! Is it love at first sight? It is called Love only if happens in first sight. What about others? Shut up. College is reopening tomorrow. Let us go home and sleep. [clatter] [tongue swisting] "I am able to cross the sky after seeing you" "I yearn for your look" He is acting as if this is the 1st day to his College. "The heart filled with love flies like a paper in wind" Stop dressing up. 9o clock bus will come anytime now. Start fast. "Say just one word." -Bye. -Hey! Wait. [water splashes] You are still a student. But you act like a rogue. Bend down. O Goddess Kali! May your son study well without indulging in any fight! Wait. Keep this money for your expense. You love me so much. Still why you are always scolding your son? Crazy boy! [no audio] Look there! He is staring at you. I know it. Keep quiet. I have scolded him before. Now he is following me in bus. I am very scared. "You are looking at me" "For the first time." "You are hearing my heart beat" "For the first time." What happened to him?! Keep quiet. Even I do not know. Get down. This is not your private bus. He is just not listening to us. Hey! I am telling you... It is getting late. We have to go for the next trip. Tell him to get down. Buddy! Buddy! -Where is that girl? -Which girl? The girl whom I followed the other day. Did that girl travel in this bus? -Yes. -But I did not see her. All the girls from this bus have gone inside the College. That girl must have also gone there. Come with us. We will find out.[whistles] [vehicle approaching] My name is Poorani. And my native place is Solangarai. I studied till 12th Std in Pattukottai Girls High School. You have a wonderful name! What are you doing here? Go to your class. [yawning] Hey Marudu! Get up. What are you doing there without being attentive in class? Tell me. What did I teach now? Do not laugh. Tell what I taught now. Sir! Am I handsome? He tortured me for 2 years by asking this question. And now he is repeating the same question in the 3rd year. What do you want? Why are you following me? Hello! I am asking you... Why are you smiling at me? Insane! Hello! Just like me, you are beautiful too. Election date is announced to elect Committee for the Irrigation Department. Maniyar has been the Committee head since 5 years. All of you know that because of his good deeds agriculture is being carried out for all the 3 seasons. I feel we can elect Maniyar as Committee Head for this term also. What do you feel? [clap continue] Super! You have already decided everything. And staging a drama here before the crowd. Tell me how much money he paid you for becoming the Head. I will pay more. You have a grown up daughter who is yet to be married. Shut up! Don't you have any respect for his age? Do not blabber. Have you come here to create problem? Do not interfere when we are talking. Why do you act as if he is the only MAN here to Head the Committee? Why are you always going behind him? Even I am a MAN. I am also like him. I am not going around naked. If he makes money in everything that is happening here, when will we get opportunity? Listen to me. It is my final decision. I am contesting this election. Let anyone oppose me. Then you will know who the real MAN is. "My heart breaks like the pulse here" "My heart breaks like the pulse here" Where is Oomaiyan? He is inside. Go and see. "We were very close to each other" College is good. It is not about that. I told you the other day that I scolded someone. Remember? He is studying in the same College where I have joined. He did not create any problem. But he is following me wherever I go and is laughing at me. Do you know what he did today? 'Like me You are also beautiful.' You have just returned from College. What are you telling him? Wash hands and come to eat. I will tell later. Is it proper to be discourteous to a respectable person in public? Who is Maniyar? He is related to you. It is not right to fight between yourselves. I feel sad. You are my mother's brother. So I was respecting you. You eat food in our house. Is it not wrong to speak on behalf of Maniyar? Get up! I said, 'Get up'. You will realize only when you suffer the consequence of your action. You will never reform. Get lost. Do not come back to eat. [motorbike approaching] You questioned my Uncle's masculinity. Now I suspect whether you are a MAN. Take off your clothes. -Remove it. -Hey! I said, 'Take your clothes off'. Go away. Hey! Go away. No! Please don't do it! No! Did you show off your valor to my Uncle when I was absent? Show me! Leave me. [clank] I feel happy that you beat him for my sake. I feel very happy. What do you think? Will I keep quiet if you are affected? Uncle! If you had a son and if someone had insulted you would he have kept quiet? I look upon you in the same way. Drink. [clank] But I feel sad that he was not slapped when he insulted you in public. You came back without reacting to it. Those who have daughters should not show off their courage in public. If we act hastily, we will be shamed. No one can harm my uncle so long as I am alive. You live like a King. I will support you. [pat] Have you not finished yet? It is getting late. Come and have dinner. Has my daughter eaten and fallen asleep? She took food and slept long back. You come down. You go. I will come. Bus has not yet come. It should have come by now. You were always late for the bus. But nowadays you come early and wait for the bus. You are a lucky guy. Enjoy. We are final year students. Should we not be a role model to our juniors? That is why I am maintaining the time. We! As role model?! They will not come up in life. Bus will not come today. It has fallen into the Pond. All of you go back home. -Really?! -Yes. Nobody else is there in the bus. Everyone has been brought to the Bank. Hope none of them have any problem. No. They have fainted. That's all. Called for Ambulance. [splash] [motorbike approaching] [no audio] [panting] [engine reviving] Hey! What happened after that? He has told about it to everyone in this College since morning. He is the only person left out. Now he is explaining to him also. I jumped into the water, searched everywhere but could not find her. I stood on the Bank and saw... [clears throat] Sister! Do you want tea? He is caught. Have you finished today's homework? I have not eaten anything since morning. He was asking me about the incident. So I was telling our story... [pat] "I saw your dark cloud like eyes" "But my thirst is still not quenched" "When you come in my dream" "I do not wish to open my eyes." "I stood still like a Sculpture because of you" "Will become a statue if you do not touch me" "Only you are there in my heart" "I am nobody without you." "I will live within you like the fish in water" "You are like the moon" "You stare at me when I look at you" "In that moment when you see me" "My heart beats for you." "I yearn for you" "You live inside me. I freeze in life" "It is not me but you!" "If I do not unite with you in real life," "Even my shadow will not be mine." "I will give up my life" "If I do not see you." "I turned into a child because of you," "And I will listen to you like a dancing doll." "I am unable to stand on the ground" "My earth rotates around you every day." "You blow like a gentle breeze when I look at you," "And blossom like a flower with honey." "My heart yearns to sing for you" "Will invite you to lean on my shoulder." "I will live for you" "The only boon which I ask is to see you." "I have no life without you." "My life is yours." "Even if I lose my relatives," "I will keep thinking about you." "I do not have the courage to die without uniting with you" "I want to marry you." "I became a Hero because of you" "I will come riding a chariot to kidnap you" "Lost my sleep because of you" "You are my queen." "You are my Lady" "I will ask for your hand from your father." "Will marry you and fall on your lap" "Will love you even after my death." Dry fish for sale! Dry fish for sale! Hey! Come here. Coming. [footsteps running] What type of fish do you have? Which one do you want? I have dried Anchovies, milkfish etc. Which one do you want? Tell me. Give me dried milkfish. Weather is extremely hot. I am thirsty. Can you get me some water to drink? Poorni! Bring some water to drink. Put some more. Why are you so mean? If I put extra for every buyer, my business will end up in loss. Take. [chink] Who is she? Your daughter? -Yes. She is my daughter. -What is she doing? Studying in College. Wait. I will bring money. In which College are you studying? Ennaji Rajappa College. My son is also studying there. His name is Marudu. -Do you know him? -Is he your son?! Yes. Do you know him? Does he attend college properly? Does he study well? Or Is he creating problems there just as he is doing here? No. Marudu is a very good boy. He studies well. Do not worry. As per his father's wish, I want to give him good education. So I am selling dry fish and leading a frugal life. I feel happy when I hear good things about him. Take money. See you. Dry fish for sale! Dry fish for sale! "You stood with me" He has done something for which he was called for enquiry. Now what is he doing inside? Marudu! "You are the essence of my life" Has he slept? -"I will die without you." -Radio is still playing. Hey! Did you eat? I have eaten. You eat and sleep. I wonder what he ate! I have brought some sweet for you. Eat it and then sleep. [puff] I will eat in the morning. Do not nag me. I bought because you like it. Never mind. I went to sell dry fish in the next village. I saw a girl there who said she studies with you. Her name sounded something like 'Parni' or Poorni'. I was shouting at you before but you did not get up. Now that I mentioned a girl's name, you are right in front of me! I did not come for that reason. I came for the sweet which you bought for me. Give. Take. What did she say? I have understood your intention. I have no such feelings. It is only because you should not believe it if someone complains about your son. That is why I asked. I would have believed if she had told spoken wrongly about you. [tongue twisting] Why are you staring at me? That is the truth. Rascal! I could not believe when she said that you are a good boy and study well. You may go. "You stood along with me" "And our hearts unite." Poorni! Marudu. What are you doing here? Are you waiting for someone? Waiting for you. -For me?! -Yes. Why? College people are gossiping that we love each other after seeing us together. But you do not worry. You should not mistake me when you come to know about it. That is why I came to tell you. Both of us have no such feelings. Let people gossip. I will neither feel about it nor mistake it. Hope you did not mistake me. No. I have not mistaken you. Really you did not mistake me? Really I did not mistake it. Then... I love you. I started loving you the day I saw you. I did not tell it then because I did not want you to reject me. I waited till you start liking me. What happened? Why are you crying? I told my feelings. Forget it if you do not like it. You came... Spoke... And now you are going away. Drop me in the bus. Did you hold my hand for this reason? Tell the truth. Do you like me? Yes. I like you. I like to speak and mingle with you. But let us not fall in love. [bus honking] [clatter] Many young boys here have chosen their life partner and are married. I want you to get married. But I think it will not happen when I am alive. Stop nagging me. Whatever I speak is nagging for you. Only a Mother will know the gossip going around here. You want me to get married. Right? Search a girl for me. I will marry her. As if people stand in queue to give their daughter to you! Nobody is willing to give their daughter to you for marriage. They are right. You are not a good man. You associate with your Uncle and are involved in thrashing people. Who will give his daughter to you? Your mother has no sense. You also don't have? Will anyone search for a girl outside when there is a suitable match in relation? -What are you saying? -Marry your uncle's daughter Poorni. It is disgusting. I brought her up since she was a child. How can I marry her? [spit] He is not telling some unusual thing. A girl is brought up to get married to her. Why don't you understand? Buddy! Who is Poorni? She is your uncle's daughter. You have helped your uncle a lot. Will he not give his daughter in marriage to you? Go and ask.[lighting] You can wait for certain things. But this matter is not like that. Take care. Come. As if people stand in queue to give their daughter to you! Nobody is willing to give their daughter to you for marriage. [motorbike approaching] [door knocking] [door opens] What is the matter? Why have you come at this hour? I want to speak to you. Come in. We can speak. No. Let us speak and then go inside. Okay. What is the matter? Tell me. You often call me 'son-in-law'. Didn't you think of getting me married? That's all? -I will find a girl for you immediately. -Why? Will you not get your daughter married to me? Your tone is changing. Nobody is ready to get his daughter married to me. Because I am a rogue. They say that I fight with everyone. Of course I beat them. But I do it for your sake. So it is not wrong to I marry your daughter. Why are you speaking like this? You are drunk. Go home and come tomorrow. Am I drunk? Am I a drunkard? This is my final question. Will you get your daughter married to me or not? If I refuse... I will kidnap her. -What did you say? -Stop! Take off your hand. [sighs] I would have given you my property if you had asked for it. But my daughter is my life. Are you telling me that you will kidnap my daughter? You... -No! Listen to me. -Father, stop... -Listen to me. -Father... -Leave me. -All are watching us. Come inside... Get out. Come on, get out. Come in. You and your uncle were dominating everyone in this place. I expected this to happen. [anklets clinking] Why did you call me here? Poorni, you said that you like to speak and mingle with me but will not love me. I was thinking about it and did not get sleep at night. [tongue twisting] Why are you not in love with me? Am I not handsome? Have you gone mad? Does love happen because of beauty? Listen! Forget about love and study properly. Did you think of your mother? She is suffering so much by going to different places to sell dry fish. Am I more important to you than her? Does it mean that a boy from poor family should not fall in love? I did not mean that. I do not want to fall in love. Understand? Why? Because my father will never agree. He doesn't like such things. It is foolish to love someone when I know that my love will never be accepted by him. I do not wish to do that. I love you. Not your father. [chuckles] Can I leave you because he doesn't like it? I cannot reform you. Poorni! Like me you are beautiful even when you are angry. [pouring] -Poorni! -What? He said you were talking to a boy, standing on the bridge. Who is he? He is my classmate. Classmate? You can speak to him in college. Why should you speak to him outside the premises? Don't do this again. Understand? Okay. Our daughter has no such feelings. But if that boy has... [vehicle receding] [footfalls] -Give one cup of tea. -Okay. Has the girls returned from the Computer class? Will I do my business or look for the girls coming from Computer class? I feel you may change my job. Not enough if you just work in your shop. You should know what is happening around you. Only then you can answer to boys like me and your business will also pick up. I am not interested in such things. Which is your native place? -Are you asking me? -Yes. Kilamangalam. Why are you asking? A boy from your village is creating problem to a girl from our place. We have come to see that person. Who? Which place? In Solangarai. Maniyar's daughter Poorni. You are asking the right person. Why don't you ask directly? Why are you beating around the bush? You have understood rightly. If we again see you roaming with that girl we will break your limbs. Be careful. What right do you have to say that? I love that girl. She also loves me. I cannot leave her. That girl doesn't love you. Concentrate on your studies. Did she tell you that she doesn't love me? She didn't say. Right? You may go now. Are you being sarcastic? Will you not listen to us? I love that girl. Please go from here. [thud] [clatter] [groaning] Poorni! -Poorni... -See there! [coughs] [beating] Marudu! -Please do not harm him. -You go from here. -You go home. -Tell them. -Poorni! Tell them. -Let him go. Poorni! Tell them. -Poorni! Say that you love me. -Go home. I said, 'Go home.' Are you crazy? Can't you understand things? Can't you understand? -Brother... -I said, 'Go home'. -Go. Take her home. -Brother, please do not beat him. -Let us go away from here. -Brother... -Come. -Please don't beat him. [groaning] [crying] Come. Let us go away from here. Car! Poorni! Tell them that you love me. -Spare him. -Come on. Brother... No... Let us go away from here. Poorni! Hey, Poorni. Come. Let us go. -Poorni! Come. Let us go. -Leave me. Marudu... [crying] Poorni! Poorni! -Tell them that you love me. -Come. Let us go. -You understand... -He doesn't understand. -Please, understand... -You love me. Right? -Do you love me? Tell, Poorni. -Come. -Marudu! -Do you love me? -Do you love me? -Yes, I love you. Are you satisfied now? Brother! What happened? Who beat you like this? Tell. Poorni said that she loves me. He is hurt badly. Come. Let us go to hospital. Come. Lift him. Wait.[footfalls] Poorni said that she loves me. I am stupid. -I told him in haste. -Listen. Do not cry. [vehicle approaching] What is your name? Mari. -Yours? -Murugesan. Who are you? Why are you enquiring about us? -Who is Marudu? -Why are you asking? [groaning] Sir! -Marudu is a common name here. -Yes. We do not want to tell you the wrong person. That is why... A boy named Marudu is after a girl named Poorni who comes from Solangarai to attend college here. I want to meet him.[laughs] He is referring to Sister Poorni. Even we study in the same college. Sir! Who are you? Poorni's uncle. [cow mooing] [footfalls] Sir! Your brother-in-law is beating a boy who was troubling your daughter in college. I came to inform that. Okay. You may go. Go and tell your brother not to turn the matter into a serious one. He doesn't listen to me. Either you should tell him or our daughter... What shall I say? My words have no value here. -Poorni! -Yes, father. Tell your uncle to release that boy. [hen clucking] Okay, father. -Go with her. -Okay. Why are you staring at me? You do not understand your brother. But I understand him fully. He is a very good person. He might have spoken wrongly on that day because he was drunk. But his mind is pure. You thrashed me and asked about a girl named Poorni. But I have never seen such a girl. Oh, God! Oh, God! Useless fellow! You are ugly looking. Were you after my granddaughter? I will break you limbs. I am going to be thrashed by this old lady also. Alas! -Oh, mother... -Hey! What is it? You ogle even at my grandmother. I can imagine how you would have gazed at my sister! I will teach you a lesson. Oh no... No, no... Even a small boy from this village is beating me. Oh, God! He is eating so fast that I think he will beat me again after gaining strength! Alas! Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, no... What is the matter? Why have you come? Do not beat him. Please release him. He is already hurt. You also do not beat him. See there! He is hanging like a crow from electric pole. Who is he? Where is Marudu? What are you saying? Is he not the person who was after you? I do not know him at all. I see. Hey! Bring him. Oh, God! I wonder in which tree he is going to tie me up and beat! Oh, God! What is your name? Did you thrash me all the while to ask this? Ayanar. I mistook you for Marudu and beat you. You may go. Oh, mother... Sir! Be careful. -Who are you? -I am Poorni. Is she that girl? Oh, mother! Wish she could have come bit earlier. Stop this matter here. I feel bad that others are affected because of me. Including you... See you, uncle. Let us go. Instead of attending the college peacefully he is always involved in some fight. My husband is dead. I should have also died with him. Then I need not worry about such things. He doesn't listen to me at all. How can I bear it if he something untoward had happened? Why are you crying now? Nowadays boys chase girls. But Marudu is not like that. It is usual thing to indulge in fight in College. But how can I allow him to continue like this? When is he going to reform? Pray Goddess Kali to show a path. Hey! Are you in romance mood? Why are you looking at the ceiling and smiling? Are you not able to hear your mother's cry? If your mother knows the real fact, she will make a big fuss over it. Keep quiet. Brother, Poorni said that she loves me. -Is it? -Yes. We sacrificed a person for the sake of his love. Now we do not know his whereabouts. But look at him. He is not worried about anything and is still in his romantic mood. Brother, did they really beat you? They threw me in the air and stamped on me. -Is it? -Yes. [birds chirping] I was beaten because of you. And now are you playing music and enjoying it? Go... Oh, God! Oh, mother... Oh, God! Oh, mother... [whistles] Poorni! Poorni! Reached college. All of you get down. [vehicle halts] Poorni! [whistles] Poorni... [footfalls] Poorni! Poorni! Is this a college or some other place? Sir! Am I looking handsome? Of course, this is a college. [sighs] You are neither eating food nor coming out of the room. What is the matter? Your behavior is not alright. Let your father come back. Then you will be fine. I don't want. You may go. I said, I don't want. Listen to me. I don't want to eat. You go. I said I love him because I did not want him to get beaten. But he has taken it to heart and is after me. I also ignore him. But I fear he may harm himself because of that. Yes, I love him. [sighs] [air flowing] Marudu! Are you going to say 'They were thrashing you so much.' If you ask whether I love you at that time, what can I do? That is why I said that I love you.' No, Marudu! Then are you going to say, 'Your mother is educating you with great difficulty.' Am I more important to you than her? No. I do not know whether you said it because you liked me or not. But you said it. It is still in my heart. Let it remain so. Don't advice me to study or take care of my mother. I can handle it. Marudu! I will not come after you from now. Are you happy? Like me you also look beautiful when you are angry. Hey! "Sky is changing its color after seeing me" "Evening sets in because of that" "Night is waiting for the moon" "My heart asks" "whether this feeling is real" "My heart is taunting at me" "My face looks new to me" "I do not feel like speaking" "I am trying to laugh" "without being seen by anyone." "The earth is not new to sky" "How can earth survive without being touched by rain?" "There is some glitch in my feeling" "I have to cross over it." "Our eyes speak when they meet" "Our mouth speaks in other times." "Flower blossoms on the place touched by feet" "I wish you see me" "even when eyes are closed." What shall I name it? Marudu. "Why are you feeling shy?" "Can we live forever?" "I can never forget it in my lifetime" "I will choose you amongst many." "I was carrying this burden all this time" "Who has the power to unload it?" "Imagine how Earth will look without any living being" "Tell the reason for which living beings were created." "I do not know to draw curtains" "My heart goes in search of you." "My eyes turn red without putting henna" "It turned towards you for love" "I am awake whole night thinking of you" "I became alone at dawn." "Everyone should say we are the perfect couple" "They should come together and bless us." "All these visuals should turn out to be real" "What else will I pray to God?" [instruments playing] Alas! She is dead! Alas! She is dead! They may fight between themselves. But Maniyar has come to do his duty. He is really a great man! Alas! She is dead! [crying] Grandma... Grandma! Do not worry. We will take care. It is getting late. Let us perform the rituals. -Buddy! -Yes. Hold this. Okay. Mother! Mother! People are sitting outside to eat. Why are you sitting here? -Mother! -Nothing... -Why are you crying? -Not feeling good. Oh! Are you reminded of your husband? Your father came in my dream yesterday. It is a happy thing. Why are you crying for that? Okay. Did he ask about me? Or did he fondle only you and left? Why are you speaking like this? He said, 'Do not lose our son like you lost me.' I am not feeling good since then. Hey! Will you listen to your mother and behave properly from now? Mother, he has told rightly. You always scold me. Suppose I get angry and run away... That is why he told like that. I will not leave you and go away. Okay. Come. Let us go. -Where? -Let us go out. Where are we going? Will you come with me only if I tell the place? No. I have not gone out like this without informing in house. If anyone sees us... That is why I am scared. We will come back fast. Do not be scared. Okay. -My dear wife! -Yes? You are coming with your husband. Why don't you lean on my shoulder? THANJAVUR MUNICIPALITY SIVAGANGA GARDEN Come. Sit near me. No. There are many people around us... I am scared. Okay. Are you angry? [zipping] I have prepared food today. Will you eat? Can any human eat it? I will eat. [slurp] [birds chirping] It is very tasty. I said I do not want to eat just casually. -How can you eat without giving me? -Who are you to me? Why are you addressing me without respect? How dare you ask me this? Look! Do not call me without respect. What will you do if I call? I will complain to my husband. I want to live happily with you till death. What happened? Are you getting emotional? Even if you tell me, I will not leave you till death. [rain fall] [vehicle approaching] -Poorni! -Yes, father. Why are you so late? That... In College... She might have had some special class. Why are you asking her? -You go and eat. -Okay, uncle. Okay. Go in. [anklets clinking] You know her uncle's nature. He saw you both when you were going together. I am scared about his reaction. Will everything be alright if we worry about that? This matter has to come to light some day. Let us think that today is that day. Marudu! Some people are coming to see Poorni for marriage in two days. Why are you saying all of a sudden? Who is the groom? There is a person named Kadiresan in Thanjavur. He did business with me. His son is the groom. We met yesterday and were talking. Suddenly he asked our daughter's hand for his son. Theirs is also a traditional family. Boy is working in Singapore. He is coming home on 6 months leave. So he said that we can perform their marriage during that time. Even I agreed. What is the hurry? We can find some other groom for her. Why should we get her married while she is studying? It is a good alliance. So I thought we can perform the marriage as early as possible. What do you say? Why should we refuse if the alliance is good. Do you agree? Okay, father. We will send her to college after the engagement. Okay. [dog barks] [footfalls] [clatter] Hey! I am Marudu. I am Marudu. I want to meet Poorni. [thud] [footfalls] [groaning] No. Father's decision will not become true. Go and sleep. I will definitely marry Marudu. I am hopeful. You do not worry.[pat] Has Marudu come? "O Girl! Come." "O Girl! Come." -Oh, God! Marudu. Leave me. "-O Girl! Come." Sir need not know. Hand him over to Police by saying that he came to rob. -Sir! Please do not beat me. -Tell me. I did not rob. Oh, God![slap] -Marudu... -Sir! I did not. -Speak out. -Sir... Are you robbing at this age? -Please tell them not to beat him. -Are you lying? -Tell. -Are you lying? -Tell. -Don't beat him. -Who are you? -Please do not beat him. -Take her out. -Please do not beat him. Oh, God! Don't beat him. Sir, I beg of you. Please do not beat my son. Do not hit my son.[crying] Please do not beat my son. Please do not beat my son. -I feel the pain. -Mother... -I feel pain. -Sir... -Please leave my son. -He is not a thief. He loves the girl staying in that house. He went to see that girl. Please release him. Oh, God! Alas! Oh, God! What is happening? Oh, God! Why? -Why should you suffer like this? -Oh, God! Lift him. Get up and go. -Get up. -Come. Come. -Get up. -Come fast. Be careful. Come. Come. -Come fast. -Go. It is not wrong to love someone. But it is wrong to love someone who is of higher status. Now who is suffering? It is your mother who is suffering. Try to understand and behave properly. You may go. Hey! She is alone. Take care. We are going to Thanjavur. Come. "O Girl! Come." "Who sowed the seed in an infertile land?" "I have turned into a corpse." "He came and conquered my heart" "He is called 'Thief' because of me." "I pour you in my tongue" "And take you to my heart" "I love you a lot" "My love is eternal" "It is because of fate" "That our love has become a barren land." "I came here like the rain." "Will our directions change?" "Will we become single?" "My fate will not change" "Even if I pray" "will my love turn into a mirage?" [[vehicle approaching] [crying] What happened? I do not understand what is happening to me. I want Marudu. Do not cry. You will surely get Marudu. I will unite you both. Don't worry. Did you eat? Did you eat? Go and bring food. [footfalls] Come. I am scared of father. If he harms Marudu... [tongue twisting] Don't be scared. I will speak to your father. Eat. Marudu has come home from police station. We will go and see him. Eat. Who is that girl? Poorni. Do you love her a lot? Yes. [motorbike approaching] Please do not beat him again. I request you. Please spare him. Why are you pleading with him? Can he go away unharmed from here after beating Marudu? I have not come here to create problem. I have come to speak to Marudu. He is still alive. Go and see. Greetings! I am fine. Unpleasant things have happened. Please do not keep it in mind. What was my mistake? I came to see Poorni. Of course, it was wrong. But you handed me over to police and made my mother fall at their feet. I can understand. Do not feel sad about it. My uncle is old fashioned. He is bothered about his prestige. He is also not wrong. He has only one daughter and would like to get her married in a decent family. But I will be happy to get Poorni married to a person of her choice. I will speak to my uncle and unite you both. Do not worry. See you. Did you see Marudu? How is he? Now? No. There will be problem if father comes to know about it. No. It will become complicated. -Listen to me. Try to understand. -Go. Go. [scrape] [scratching] "O Girl! Come." Where is my daughter? Where is she? I believed you and left her here. Tell me. Tell.[crying] Tell... What were you doing instead of taking care of her? -I brought you up like my own son. -Where is she? Don't you know? Tell. Sir! [fire crackling] Alas! [man in pain] [crying] Even if you tell, I will not leave you till my death. [screaming] Alas! Alas! Alas... -Oh, God! -Poorni... Poorni...[crying] You killed our girl because I made your mother fall at the Policeman's feet. We brought her up with lot of affection. Alas! But she is dead now. Alas! I cannot bear it. -My dear! -My dear! She is dead! She has left us. What shall I do now? My daughter is dead. You hit me with slippers when I asked for your daughter's hand. Cry. Cry now. Why have you brought me here? Let us talk. Marudu is waiting for me there. Come. Let us go. Come. Let us go there. I can still hear the sound of the beating I got with slippers. I am unable to digest that pain.[sighs] If I return back that pain to your father? Why are you speaking like this? I am scared. Marudu is waiting there. I will go. Do not cry. Do not cry. I cannot bear it. But your father should cry. Uncle! I will go and inform them. My dear daughter! "My heart refuses to pardon" "Such inhuman people." "My heart is not paining" "He has turned into a living doll." [screaming] [motorbike approaching] MARUDU POORNI [tyres screech] [loud bang] [engine reviving] [hiccup] [vehicle approaching] [hiccup] I will go and inform about this.
