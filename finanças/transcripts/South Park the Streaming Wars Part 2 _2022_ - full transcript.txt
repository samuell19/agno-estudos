Chuck Chuck. What the fuck is that thing? I think I can explain it all. You see, for Pipi's plan to work, he needed to control climate change. And the only way to control anything, is by fucking its mom. But what Pipi didn't count on, was that a child will stop at nothing to find out who is fucking their mom. Chuck Chuck. See? I-I keep them safe, uh-huh. Whoa, whoa. Hold on a minute, ManBearBitchie. We have a great team, no? You no wanna hurt Pipi. Look at everything we've done! I give you half of the company, huh?! What do you say, ManBearBitchie?! We can own the only streaming service in the world together! - It's over. We did it! - We did it, Dad! Randy. Thank you so much. Randy? What are you staring at? Oh, here we go again. No, wait. Mr... Mr. Marsh? My eyes are up... Dude! How to get saltwater to the desalinization plant. Saltwater... saline. Saline in the plant. Saline implant! Holy fuck! Today we try for a new beginning. You know, in police work, we don't always get it right. I wanted a deck in my hands so bad that I didn't care whose deck it was. But I'm happy to be standing here now with our new test subject. Thank you. I just want to say to my mom... Mom, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I can't always be the son that you need. Because right now you need a son that can stay firm and teach you a lesson. But unfortunately, duty calls. I'm ready. Okay, hit it. ♪ ♪ Okay, it works. Bring in the rest! ♪ ♪ We got Matt Damon to tell every woman with fake tits to be brave! Look at all of them. It's working! Hey, everybody! Look! ManBearPig is leaving with PigBearGirl and Chuck Chuck. Chuck Chuck! Hey, wait. If that little thing is gonna be climate change someday, shouldn't we, like... kill it? I think what we should do is try to reach out to it, see what it needs and see if it can be different from its father. Yeah, but that all sounds really hard. We have enough water for the summer now. Fuck it. Let's smoke some weed! ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪
