Open the door! Can you hear me? Open the door! When you open it, I'm gonna beat you to death! What is this? I hope you realise who I am. To avoid any misunderstandings, okay? Good. Nonetheless, if you open the door now, I am willing to forget everything. No smoking Cameraman, you have some kind of leak here. The photograph I told you about. - So? - Yes, but it's not a good picture. - That's all I got. - You think it's what we need. I thought he was a thief and wanted to take his picture but then I saw the fire. We can now prove he was in the building the night of the arson. - And if you testify... - Wait a minute. Wait. I don't want to get involved. I just wanted to show you the picture. Okay, calm down. The picture will suffice. How much? - What do you mean? - Money for the picture. Wait, we never said anything about money. That goes without saying, or I would have gone to the cops. You have a big law firm, you got a lot of money. I don't know if you realise this... but the guy you photographed, burned down a school. - So what? - Are you a complete idiot? Without the picture, he will walk free due to insufficient evidence. That's your problem. If you want the picture... - you have to pay me. - Are you crazy? - 3.000 dollars or you get nothing. - Really? - You want the arsonist to walk free? - Think about it. - We'll talk again. - Wait a minute. Don't touch me! - Come on, Mitsos, it's so early! - I can't find my keys. - They are not here. - Yes, I see. I'll take yours. Are you okay? What? - What are you doing? - What do you mean? I was sleeping. - You have to go to your interview. - I am not going. - Are you serious? - There is no point. Listen to me... I never studied so now I don't mind working as a transporter. You studied law! Why do you want to have the same job as me? Don't think about the past. Come on. Okay. - Will you go? Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure, Mitsos. When you finish, go and deliver the rest of the packages and come to work. - Okay? - Yes. Bye. The keys... - The queen can capture the tower. - I didn't see you come in. - I didn't mean to startle you. - Do you have an appointment? Yes, my name is Aris Apostolou, I'm here for the interview. One moment. The next appointment is here. - You have to wait. - Yes, of course. Maria, send in the next one. Hello... Sit down. You have three minutes. - Your name is... - Aris Apostolou. Tell me, Apostolou, what do you know about our firm? I know that you have a good reputation. Exactly. So we hire only the best. Are you one of them? - I hope so. - You hope. So you are not. - No, I am one of the best. - You are very modest, Apostolou. Do you have any previous experience, or did you decide to try your luck? - I worked at another law firm. - And? Did they fire you? - Something happened... - And they fired you. Tell me why do you believe that this job is yours, Apostolou? I have a good previous experience, I work really hard... Do you have another job now? Will you be available in the near future? I do, but it won't be a problem if you... May I ask what is it about? I deliver packages. I am the driver. So you are a transporter? I see. We will let you know, have a good day, etc... - Excuse me, that was all? - Yes, you can go now. Are you sure? I can tell you about my studies... - No, we will let you know. Thank you. - But I think I could tell you a bit more. Seriously now, I never said anything about your studies but let's look at the facts. First of all, you were fired. Therefore you are untrustworthy. Secondly, you work as a driver. Therefore you don't want to work as a lawyer because you don't want to commit. And lastly... This. "Violence at Centre Court" A lawyer attacked the defendant before the trial. How did this happen? In conclusion, you have a history for violence... Time's up, have a good day! You think you know me? Do you think you can treat me like this? Like I'm a nobody? Please calm down. Maria! No one gave you the right to treat people like this. Do you understand? So take the job and eat it! Idiot! No problem. He just left. He nearly demolished my office. I told him that we can't hire him because of his past. Don't worry, Mr. Apostolou. Nice doing business with you. There is a precedent. We will file an appeal. I want to talk to you. - I'm with a client, can't you wait? - No. Excuse me. Complete lack of professionalism. I had an interview at the law firm of Efstathopoulou. - And? - A certain Mr. Apostolou... intervened so I wouldn't get the job. Why do you want to be a lawyer? Why don't you stay at your current job? Since when do you care? Maybe because I went to another firm and not yours. The name Apostolou is not only yours. Every time you fail, you cause problems to my firm. Did you forget how embarrasing it was when you accused me on the newspapers? It all makes sense now. You only care about yourself. This job is not for you. You are hot-tempered and unpredictable. There is one thing you don't realise. I studied law because it was my mother's dying wish. I guess I only care about that. Don't be stupid, you know I miss her also after the accident. Really? I see that you have already moved on with your life. Work is going great, no point in letting the family ruin it. You are not ready, maybe you will never be. You should seek the help of an expert, I have a friend who is a psychiatrist. You need a psychiatrist! I know that you want me gone! You should have killed me when you killed my mother at the accident! Don't mess with my life. Next time I see you, it will be in court. Too much work, right? Take a break to relax. Sign here. Wake up, stupid! - Why are you yelling? - Sign here, I finished the deliveries. - What happened at the interview? - My father intervened and we had a fight. - What are you going to do now? - Sign this and I'll go home. - No, I'm going home. You... - What is it now? You have this. Deliver it today at Sifnou 13. - I am tired, I woke up really early. - You have to deliver it today. Nice, you can speak english. Sifnou 13 Hello? Hi, Aris. - Who is this? - Do you know who you are? Aris, the God of war and conflict. God of anger. Thank you for claryfing that. You have some problems with your behaviour and I want you to realise them. Your choices have consequences. Action and reaction. - Do you remember why you came here? - Yes, I brought a package and... What did you do to me? The package was for you, you are wearing its content. If you hang up again, I am going to kill you. Do you understand? - Yes! Yes! - Good, let's begin with the basics. You are wearing a device with C4 on it. You can set it on fire, or even shoot it and it might not explode. I have the detonator, the only thing that can trigger the explosives. - Explosives? - So far so good? - Explosives! - Aris, so far so good? Yes! Yes! There are three ways to get rid of the bomb. You can try to take it off yourself and it will explode. If the time runs out, it will explode. Is there a way so I don't get blown to pieces? - Get in your car and go. - Wait a minute! I have all the minutes in the world, you don't. Do you want to waste them? - Under your seat there is a suitcase. - Yes, I see it. There is a lock on your bomb. You will go to the nightclub "Gorgona". You will exchange the suitcase with a briefcase that has the key inside. Will the key stop the bomb? I suggest you hurry and keep your mouth closed. Damn it! Are you trying to kill someone? I was speeding but I have a delivery and I'm running late. Licence and registration. Here. Everything in order? Do you know how fast you were going? You almost destroyed my side mirror. You are right, but if I don't deliver the package in time I'll be in trouble. You are already in trouble, you exceeded the speed limit. Open the trunk. - Give me a fine. - I said, open the trunk. Where is the package? - What package? - The one you said you had to deliver. I was in such a hurry that I forgot to take it. Are you joking? You must be employee of the month! Please, I have to go. You are coming with me to the station. - To the station? Give me a fine! - You can't tell me what to do! - Why not? You tell me what to do! - Do you know you exceeded the speed limit? I don't care about the speed limit! Gorgona I'm here for the exchange. - Sit down. - I'm good. Sit down! - Can I get you anything? - No, I won't stay. Here for work? Yes, but I don't know who am I supposed to meet. You don't know? Listen, I think that someone tricked you... - so you better leave. - I'll leave. You don't understand, these people exploit your need. - I can't leave either. - Okay, thanks for the advice. - Bye now. - You know what? Do whatever you want! Can you please tell me, boy what the hell happened here? - I was... - My desk was burned, you asshole! - We are lucky the whole place didn't burn down. - Must be some faulty electrical wiring. What a nice fairytale, boy. - I found this, do you know what it is? - It's a... - It's a... - A necklace. - What the fuck is it doing on my desk? - It's yours. It's not mine, you dickhead. Do I look like a whore to you? It's pretty clear, someone broke in while you were dicking around... burned my desk and left this, you fucking dipshit! So now I have some questions. Who was it? What does he want? Did someone help him? Is the faulty electrical wiring story too convenient? No, Mr. Miltos, I had no part in this. - I will tell you everything. - Of course you will, boy. I am listening. Go upstairs and clean. Bring me a new desk. - Who is this fool over here? - I am here for the exchange. - Where is Michalis? - He couldn't come, so they sent me. They sent you? Do you think I am a moron? - Do you want me to split your head open? - Calm down! - I won't take any more shit! - Calm down, they sent me! Die, motherfucker... What are you looking at, cockroach? Take your dickhead friend and scram. Now! Hi, Michalis. Who is that fool in front of me? Did he bring the stuff? He did but I told you I don't want any surprises. I couldn't come so I sent the kid with the red jacket. He's okay. - Are you sure? - Yes, don't worry. It's all right. He said you are okay. - I brought you the suitcase. - Do you want a drink? - Annoula, get him a drink. - No, I'm good. Come on baby, make a coffee for him. - Do you like my place, brother? - It's nice. Nice... not just nice, it's amazing! We renovated it because it was completely burned down. We worked hard for three months. Am I boring you, boy? - No, I'm just in a hurry. - Really? You have something for me. You have something for me also. Wait, wait. Chill, boy. I'm a professional and I don't want to ruin my collaboration with Michalis... and that's exactly what's gonna happen if I split your head open and take the bag. We will place a bet for the bags. - The winner takes it all. - Please, just give me my bag. That wasn't a suggestion, dickhead! This is what's going to happen. - We'll bet and the winner takes it all. - I don't want it all. I do! And I also have this! So we'll do what I say. I'm a professional, don't make me regret it. - If I win, I take the bags and leave. - If you win... Okay. Good. I knew you were smart. - Bring the chessboard. - Chess? You didn't expect that boy, did you? I may have the profile of an adamant and rough character... but what's important in a man isn't the body, but the mind. Everything is a machine, and the most important part is the brain. You have to think and play wisely. Will you shut up so we can start the game? I understand what you are trying to do, boy. You want to make me lose my temper, take the advantage and win. I wasn't born yesterday, so this won't work. And another thing. Raise your voice again, and I will fuck everything you hold dear, got it? - Okay. - Stupid fucker! If you play fast, you'll lose fast. Check. Don't move! Don't move or I'll kill her! I mean it, drop down your weapons! Now! Grab the bag. The bag! Shoot him, dickheads! Don't move! - Boss, are you okay? - Okay? Do I look okay to you? - Shoot for fuck's sake! - Boss, he has Anna! - I said shoot, asshole! - No, Miltos! Listen to me, if you want to live, follow me. Go! - Yes? - What do you think of your new friends? I did everything you said, how do I take this off? Your job as a lawyer is to put these kind of people in prison. I'm just a transporter and right now I'm entertaining a psychopath. Don't you understand? At least you still got enough time. Ram him, that way! - How do I take it off? - With the key. You found the first. - Time for the next one. - What? I will fucking shred you! - You said I had to find the key. - There is another lock at the side. You'll go to the school "Athina". You'll have 30 minutes from the moment you get there. Move prick, move! Asshole! - Did they lose us? - I think so. Police Captain Dimitrios Gatos Come in. I'm sorry to disturb you, sir. We received calls about gunshots near Mitropoleos Square. The two vehicles involved were a jeep and a van from the "Pegasus" transport company. The driver of the van had previously attacked a policeman. Which one? Lazarou, this is the Captain, do you copy? - Yes, sir. - What do you know about the driver? I pulled him over for speeding, he resisted arrest. His name, Lazarou. What's his name? It's in my report. Apostolou. I don't have your report. His first name? You were attacked, you didn't call for backup and you don't know his name. Aris. Aris Apostolou. Sent his photo to every available unit. We need to search his home and his work. As for you, Lazarou, you better do something or I'm gonna hold you responsible. This is not some random thing. I have something to do. Go home. Are you crazy? My home is the first place they'll search. It's better if I stay here. Yes, well I doubt that. Anyway, do whatever you want. Why did you do that? - Timos, why are you here? - You tell me, you brought me here. - What? - Don't you remember? If I blow up now, maybe you will! I can't believe this, look! Wait, if you planted the bomb on me, then why? I hope I'm not interrupting. Inside the school you'll find the next key. I'll give a different clue to each one. What? To find your clue you have to go to the centre of the Earth. The centre of the Earth? Timos! - What did he tell you? - Every man for himself. Vocal Chords Wired Information Why are you here? - The key is in this room. - No way. Get out. - I think you are in the wrong place! - No, leave now! Unless the key... This is the last time I'll speak to one of you. Goodbye and good luck. The key. The key! It's your fault. This is the same room that got burned in the arson. If you hadn't destroyed the phone this lunatic would be in prison. - You made me lose my job and now my life. - You are right because the key is mine. - We have to find the key or else we'll die. - And when we find it? I don't know, we'll see. What clue did he give you? Give it to me! No! What did you do? Go, Anna! Run! You killed me! You killed me! I'm gonna take you with me! No. You can't leave me like this. You can't leave me like this! Damn it! Shit! Is the same thing gonna happen again? What do you want from me? Money? Answer me! I wanted Timos to live, but I couldn't help him. What is going on? You have a bomb strapped on you and you walk freely? What could I say in the club? - "Hi, I'm here with my bomb!" - Why don't you go to the police? I almost died and if the police interferes I might die sooner. Besides, I think this lunatic is someone I know. Who is it? What does he have against you? I think he is the one who burned down the school... and he wants revenge because I tried to convict him. - I guess you failed, right? - The guy that died back there... had a photo that I was going to use in the trial. - The photo was lost and the arsonist walked. - So the arsonist is responsible for this. - I'm glad that you are still alive. - Why did Timos had to die? Don't you understand what he did? Or you for that matter? - I think you are not paying attention. - I do, but now I'm fed up! As long as you listen to me, you'll live. The way you talk, shows your upbringing. Why is that relevant? Get the damn bomb off! You'll do what I tell you, or your father will die. What? Aris! I have planted the same bomb on your father. Like in the previous challenge there is only one key. - Listen, I'll do what you tell me. - You will, anyway. You'll go to the place where your family was destroyed. You have one hour. - What did he say? - I have to go to the van. What? The cops and Miltos' men are looking for you. Where are we going? - Was any of this necessary? - What do you mean? - The car. - What about it? We stole it. You had no problem with the guns and the bombs but you are upset about the car. It was a good idea to pick a discreet car with a discreet colour so we go unnoticed. I guess the bomb prevented me from choosing a suitable colour. Nice. Do you know what you are doing? Nice, and you won't even tell me who the Apostolou family is... - and why they were destroyed. - They are my parents. My mother died in a car accident. I lost my mother too. My father grieved and then he got sick. I had to find money to pay for the treatment. I got involved with Miltos and signed a contract... I still owe him money. I'm sorry, it's not like you don't have any problems. I don't mind. - You have to go to the police. - I said no cops, Anna. - Get in. - I have to call my father. - Are you joking? - It won't take long. Are you okay? - Yes. What about you? - I'm fine. Let's go. Is this the key for the bomb? You should use it. - I'm thinking about it. - What is there to think? - If I use it, my father will die. - Your father? - Why didn't you tell me? - This doesn't concern you. Of course it does. Why didn't you tell me? How did the cops find us? - Aris. - Get in the car, quickly. - I called them. - You? Can't you see, you can't do this alone? - It's not my life only on the line here. - I didn't know that. Stupid kid! I'm sorry but you can't run around with the bomb. They'll know what to do. I knew there was something wrong with you before I heard the name Apostolou. Give it up, you are surrounded! We will shoot you! Calling all units! Don't lose him! I repeat, don't lose him! Nice, I'm officially a wanted man! The perpetrator is wearing a bomb and is headed to a residential area. K56 do you copy? He is headed for the road block. Nice. I can't believe what is happening! That was not part of the plan. I said no police. - I know that, I never called them. - You have too much heat on you now. - Get rid of them! - I'm trying. The faster you get rid of them, the better for you and your father. Go to the old furniture factory on the highway. Sir, the perpetrator has escaped. Dad! - Dad! - Aris! Aris! Why did you come? I don't need any help. Yes, I can see. You have it under control. Someone knocked me out and when I woke up I had this strapped on me. Who is this guy? Do you remember the arson case? It's your client, the arsonist. I acquited that guy, why would he plant this bomb? - How will we take them off? - This key disarms the bomb. - What are you waiting for? - One of the bombs, not both. - Which one? - I don't know, we have to choose one. - I think. - You think? He sent me to the place that mom died so I could get this key. - It was my fault. - You were just a little boy. - I distracted you and mom died. - Aris! We don't have time for this. It was too complicated for a little boy to deal with. Listen to me, leave this place now. What are you doing? No! What is wrong? Why won't it stop? I'm afraid that whatever you chose the result would be the same. - This is the end of the Apostolou family. - You said one of us would die. - I did everything you asked. - You also said some lies. You said you had evidence but you didn't. Now, you'll see each other die. You could have killed me from the start. Innocent people have died as a result of your behaviour. I wonder how you sleep at night. - Why did you involve my father? - I thought you would understand. Goodbye, Aris. It's over. There is nothing we can do. - What are you doing? - I'm not going to let him hurt my family. - No wait, it's going to explode! - It will explode anyway! Wait. - Okay, now let's take off yours. - No! Stay away! - What are you doing? - The right thing. I'm sorry. I realise now what a great son I had. Dad! No! It's not fair, where is dad? - He's busy, but he wanted to come. - If he really wanted, he would come. Your dad is not coming, but you can choose how to deal with it. This is for you. When you feel that things are not going well and you are losing control, like now... try to think as calmly as possible. And everything will be all right. Come on, let's go inside. Try not to move. Rest. Captain. - Captain! - I'm taking over this case. - Where is he? - We have guards outside his room. - What's the room number, Lazarou? - 512. The doctors said... No. He must be moved to the State Prison Hospital. - He will be detained pending questioning. - Captain, he can't be moved right now. I don't think you understand. The infamous Miltos is connected to this case. We are waiting for one wrong move. Either from him or from the army of idiots he employs. Not to mention the panic from the assassinations and the explosions. Only Apostolou can shed some light. - His father just died. - What should I do? Wait a couple of months until he gets all better? Our elite units are set on high alert. - I'm aware. - This guy is important. Do you want to jeopardise the case? I thought it might be better if we handled this more subtly. If we push him now, he might withdraw and we'll lose our chance. Just give him one day. I'm confident he'll cooperate. One day, Lazarou. I really hope you are right. I'll be watching you, Lazarou. How are you? You are still in custody despite everything that happened. We have guards posted outside your room. We announced that we lost track of you after the explosion. No one can find you. It's my fault. I killed him. I have a plan. We'll find him. Menelaos Apostolou is dead His son is missing - Hello? - Hi Mitsos, it's Aris. I need a favour. Hey, what's up? - What happened? I thought you died. - Sort of. You missed three days of work. Thanks. I owe you one. How am I going to get back now? Where is the boss? Has he vanished? Aris! - What are you doing here? - No, what are you doing here? It's not mine, I thought you were one of them. - Where is Miltos? - He's not here. Are you okay? Yes. I'm great. I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you but I was certain you would react. I just wanted to help. - Why did you come back? - I want to end my contract with Miltos. But I can't find the paperwork. Why are you here? Miltos was present at the arsonist's trial so there must be some connection. It's the only lead I got. Does this mean anything to you? There is no point. You'll just turn it on again later, right? I have done some horrible things, but... Here, every day is the same thing. The same, the same. - Who was that? - The arsonist. If the arsonist planted the bombs, then how is this possible? I have no idea who is behind this. But I think he has captured Miltos. Everyone involved with the trial is dead. Except me and Miltos. Now that you mention it, someone recently burned his desk. Stop the video! Can you see that? - What is it? - It's an old export company... that went bankrupt and had its office at the port. Watch out, Anna! Maybe we should wait? It's better if we split up. We can surprise them. - Maybe we should wait for the police? - I can't risk it. - You do what you feel is right. - Okay, I want to finish this also. Let's split up. Excuse me, sir. Anna! - Annoula! - What are you doing, working out? Of course not, they planted a bomb on the bike and if I stop it will explode. - Help me honey, please! - Help you? I know what you must be thinking, why should I help this asshole? He doesn't care for me. It's not true. I really care. You tried to kill me. I'm done with you and your money. What money? Forget about them. You don't owe me anything, baby. I swear on the holy cross. On the bones of my mother. Come on, baby. Here is the bomb. Come on, sweetie. Put your hands up. Turn around. Slowly! What? Get the fuck up! Disarm the fucking bomb now. - What do you see? - There are too many wires. Like in the movies, right? There are two wires, one that disarms it and one that sets it off. For both our sakes, you'll choose the right one. Pull it! Pull it! Don't you have anything to say? I had my reasons. I read about you and your father in the newspapers. As a policeman, I deal with thiefs, murderers, rapists... but I still think that people like you are worse. Like me? What do you mean? You were part of the solution but then you became part of the problem. We arrested them but you acquitted them. - Pull it! - I must be completely stupid! Pull it, woman! Motherfucking bike. - You were right all along. - What do you mean? You are completely stupid! What about Timos? Was he a criminal or a lawyer? Collateral damage. As a policeman my authority stopped at a certain point... but I managed to become something greater. Something beyond the bureaucracy. You thought I forgot what you did, you stupid bitch? That for some reason I'm going to let you escape? Cunt! - Boss, are you all right? - No, I'm not, you fuckhead. Where were you, you retards? Nice timing as usual. I don't need you now. Hey, tell me, do you know the definition of the word "bodyguard"? Body. Guard. Otherwise, I will be just a "body". And you are motherfucking dickheads. Search the place for traps! You have to be insane to justify all those deaths. - I did you a favour when I killed your father. - Shut up! He deceived you all your life. He abandoned you when you most needed him. Be advised, the area might be trapped with explosives. He's trapped you too. You thought that I forgot about you, stupid cunt? You destroyed my club, you betrayed me and you ran away with your buddy. Leave me alone! I think I will permanently end your contract. Now. - Boss, I think I found something. - Not now, you retard! Then I'm going to catch your buddy and shred him to pieces. And then that fag that brought me here and his great grandchildren. Explosion at the north section. - What was that? - That was your girlfriend... that died because of you. Drop your weapon. Drop your weapon! I underestimated you. You still surprise me. - I was certain that you would kill me. - You wanted someone to take the blame. So you could get away with it and I would have killed an innocent. No one is innocent! Everybody is guilty! You don't have to pull the trigger to kill. That's funny. I thought that, that's the way the guns work. I have your confession on tape and your expiration date was two days ago. You left me no choice. Another explosion at the north section. We have no contact with team one. Teams three and four get ready for breach. Team three ready. Team four ready. No! Come on! I will break you. Are you all right? - Nobody moves! Nobody! - I'm a policeman, don't shoot! My badge is in my pocket. - Clear! - The chair is rigged to explode. Who are you? It's over, Aris. Who are you? Talk! You don't know me but I know you and your father. Keep talking! The arsonist that was acquitted worked for Miltos. He did what Miltos asked and set that fire. At a school for Christ's sake! To collect the insurance money. Did you know that? It was your job to know! That wasn't the only fire. Clubs that didn't pay for protection. I sent you first at Miltos' club that wasn't always his. It belonged to someone else. They were criminals that destroyed lives but they were nothing compared to you. The club that you went was burned down years ago. They said it was a gas leak and nobody got blamed. - It was just a club... - They murdered my wife. You burned her alive! All of you! The arsonist, the one that gave the order, the one that wanted more money... and finally the one that couldn't control his temper and didn't convict the murderer. You failed and he burned my wife! I wanted you to feel this, so you could understand the injustice. And there is nothing you can do to stop this. What would your wife say if she was here? That you are right? How many more have to die? How many more to bring her back? Shut up! Shut up! You can't understand! You lost your family and still you can't understand. If you could understand, you would realise that your responsibility is to kill me. Can you see this? The building across is rigged with explosives. Maybe a couple of your friends are still alive. A few more losses might make you understand. Where are you going, Annoula? You came here for one reason, right? To discuss business. Oh, one more thing, I forgot to "thank" you for before, for saving me. And you know, I... - Can you see it? - Calm down! Calm down! - We were happy, why did she have to die? - It was an accident, it wasn't intentional. She died nonetheless. Does that mean that they should not be punished? What are you doing? Are you going to shoot me with an empty gun? Don't do this. Would the man that you once were do this? The man that loved his wife. That man is... We were going to move to another city, she would change her job. We wanted a child, we would start our life. She was an angel. And the thing that hurts the most is that I will never find her.
