Chinese new year holiday is just over. Have you noticed anything different in the subway stations on your way to work? We Hong Kongers simply walk too fast and find nothing right? They are the mysterious dotted diagrams! Each station has got a different design! Looks like there is some meaning. Or not at all. Netizens said that there weren't diagrams before the CNY holidays. Probably the dotted diagrams have been drawn during the holidays. The Children's Paradise It's not like they've never been to Korea. You know my dad. He doesn't like to lose out. So he bought tickets from Korean Air. Taking the chance to layover in Korea for a couple of days. I've told the company I've to go to the airport in the morning and report for duty in the afternoon. Now I have to drive you. Can't they take the night flight? Can't believe there's a traffic jam here. I'm not in a hurry. This is Tsing Ma bridge. It was built to connect with the airport. It's really pretty with the lights at night. Headmaster, are we taking a tour of the school first? Did you fly 4 hours from Jilin to HK directly? Or did you have to transfer? Let's welcome Cao Xiao Xue I flew directly. She flew directly on China Southern Airlines. We can go if she is not tired. Are you tired? No. Then let's take a tour of the school. It's only half an hour away. Good. HK is completely different from Jilin. You can check it out. You will enjoy the associated benefits after a three-month probation. Please read through this. Does he look better in real life or in photos? Better in real life, of course. Helen asked if you have seen his resume. Did you interview him? I took part in the first round selection. We picked 20 out of 200. He ranked first. You must have judged him by his looks. Not really. His qualifications are impressive. However, it's a bit strange that he didn't study design initially. He got his first degree in computer engineering. Then earned a masters degree in fine art. His first two jobs were in computer programming. His third job was to develop websites which somewhat had something to do with design. He only became a designer with his fourth job. What is his expected salary? Byron, you don't want to know. Just keep working hard. Twice your salary? Almost. And I'm quite well paid. Hi, Byron. This is Helen. Hello, Helen. There's also Alan. -Hi, nice to meet you. -Hello. This is Siu Chung. He teaches Chinese and Korean. How are you? Xiao Xue. Bye bye. The headmaster has really outdone herself by getting such a top student from the Mainland. She didn't want to come initially. Because she has never left Jilin for her whole life. Really? Her grandparents and parents were all teachers. She's the third-generation teacher in her family. This is Yau Tong station. You can transfer at Yau Tong station, too. Actually, you can transfer at a few other stations. But the platforms are on different levels. You've to figure them out. We don't have subways in Changchun. But we have light rail. Our platforms are simpler. We also have light rail here. Light rail... Sorry, am I walking too fast? It's all right. You have to buy another ticket if you transfer at TST East Station. This is the bus terminal. This is the toilet and the bathroom. This is your room. The bedding is new. The TV isn't. Your stuff is here. This room belongs to your flat-mate. Her name is Shum Ho. She teaches Indonesian. Ah, no. Actually she teaches Cantonese to Indonesian maids. Where is she? Where does she sleep? She sleeps on the floor. She's a bit strange, but she's nice. She's on holiday and will be back after National Day holidays. Your pocket money and keys are here. Keep them safe. If you have any questions, call the Headmaster. Or you can give me a call. Thanks, Ah Man. -Hi. Byron. -You actually remember my name. Byron: Chung. Yin: What? Byron: He washed the plastic bottle that he drank from. Yin: Environment friendly. Byron: Then he threw it away. That can't be. I told you he has OCD. Helen: Missy changed her profile picture! Alan: You ain't see nothing yet. Check this one out! Sinyi: This is your first day. Feel free to ask me about anything. Are there recycling bins in the office? What did you say? Recycling bins? Sorry, there aren't. Oh. Okay. Xiao Xue: It's just like you said. The housing is small and people in HK walk very fast. Of course I won't go to TST and Mongkok. Am I a tourist? Bamboo: Don't worry. I don't need you to buy baby formula for me. Mom, I've just arrived in HK. I know, don't worry. I won't eat instant noodles. Mom, I have to hang up. Any pretty girls at the new office? Yes, but they're like secondary school students. Are you referring to their figures or intelligence? We are also students. When we were in secondary school their parents hadn't met yet. That's really sad. It's time for you to... What? The term that you always use, what your mom always nags you about. Why are you calling? I want to borrow your car to move house. Sure. You're not thinking of taking all that junk back to your house, are you? The new place has space. Why are you renting at Laguna City? It's not close to your office. Because I can see Taikoo Shing. Then why don't you live in Taikoo Shing? The rent is too high. I can't find a suitable unit in the building I used to stay. You think too much about the past. My Mom asked why aren't you buying a house. Watch out. Whoa. There are so many. What's going on? It's the first day of work. There shouldn't be so many. -That's right. -It's not my idea. It's the headmaster's. Able people do more work. But it is quite a lot. Read up. Karaoke on Saturday? Sinyi: Wanna join us for karaoke the day after tomorrow? It's Yin's birthday. SC: Karaoke? Sinyi: Not interested? SC: I'm in the middle of a move. Sinyi: You're moving to a new flat? Sinyi: Why don't we have a house-warming party? SC: Some other day. PING AN You're online again. Yes. Did you just get home, or have you not been out? I haven't been out. You've been at home all day again. -It's not bad. -It's been over a month now. You're either at work or at home. You go back and forth between two subway stations. Your Hong Kong is only that big. I like it that way. Isn't Chung Yeung Festival coming soon? You have to get to know HK. You're the one who likes HK, not me. Hello, Miss Shum, you're back. Hello, you must be Xiao Xue. Yes. Oh, yes. There're some letters for you. I'll get them for you. Sure. Thanks! Miss Shum. Why don't we go eat and shop tomorrow? Miss Shum, Miss Shum. Bamboo: Just go out for a stroll For Suet Chung, from Auntie Wai-fong Daniel, what is it? Next weekend, four or five of us would like to visit your new house. I'm sure you can accommodate us. Next week? I can't. You're still not settled? What have you been doing for the past few weeks? Tidying up. There are boxes everywhere. I still have a long way to go. I beg you, pick a date. So I can inform the other guys. How about next month? This is not the first time. I'll not force you then. Don't fiddle around with your old stuff. Touching them and be mesmerized by them all day long. This is call slow living. You won't understand. Chai Wan, end of the Island Line. Thank you for traveling on the subway. Chai Wan, end of the Island Line. Thank you for traveling on the subway. Fat Man. This is Xiao Xue. Do you have a second? You wanted to see me? Fat Man look what's on the wall? You mean the numbers or the dots? I think someone did this deliberately. I saw the same thing as Lam Tin station. Deliberately? That's impossible. This station has been around for over twenty years. This is right by the roadside. Many people pass by here every day. Maybe it's just dirt. And no one cleaned it. It can't be man-made, right? Wait, let me take a picture. I want to take a picture of that. I was helping you to focus. I came back specially to feed you on Sunday. That's really nice of me, isn't it? I don't see you feeding me. No one's snatching with you. Why the hurry? Fat Man have you played these games as a child? Yes, I have. I was really good at it. If there were no numbers beside the dots, can you connect them? What? If there were only ten or so, then it's not too bad. But if there are too many and there is no order, then it's impossible to connect them. Theoretically, each dot can be the first. Look, there are 50 dots here. That means there are 50 variations. I reproduced 50 pictures. We can test out each of the 50 possibilities. Wait, you mean that there are 50 possibilities for the first dot. To find it, one multiply 50 by 49... Times 48, times 47... There are a few million possibilities for the first few dots. This is a mathematical problem. That's right, probability. I understood it right away. But is this possible? From 50 to 45, we can guess the first 6 dots. Once we can figure out the first six then the following ones will be much easier to find. The most important thing is how to find the first dot. It's not easy. We are humans, not computers. I don't know how to explain it. But I think I can do it. It's good that you feel that way. I'm okay with that. Now I understand why Headmaster hired you. Who would have come up with such a silly game? I will go feed the fishes. Bamboo: Back home yet? Where are you, Cao Xiao Xue? Daimaru Causeway Bay Station Chai Wan Station Hi! Why are you following me? Your scarf is the same as mine. They're not the same. Yours was knitted first. And it's fully knitted. Mine is not yet completed. Is your surname Wong? Fong Deceased: Wong Wai Fong Gas Explosion in Daimura Department Store. Two dead, hundreds injured. I saw you coming in early. Why are you so early? Not too early, it's 4 p.m. already. You don't have class in the afternoon, you should get more rest. Look at your complexion. What's wrong with my complexion? You look tired. Don't you think that for the whole week, you've looked tired? Really? Yes, looks like it. Still not willing to give up? I've been to the Tsuen Wan TKO, and Island lines. I found different patterns at every station. It's good that you've been to so many different stations. At least you've seen more of HK. I don't know why I can't find any on the East and West Rail lines. If that's the case I can make a guess. It this is really man-made the person must be local. These must've been done a few years ago. According to local people, the Island Tsuen Wan, Kwun Tong, TKO and Tung Chung lines are all subway lines. East and West Rail are railway lines. They used to be two different companies that merged a few years ago. Before the merger? Are you thinking of finding that person then connect the dots? Dr. Cao, Making graffiti is illegal, you shouldn't try it. I told you that you should go out more on weekends. If you listened, you would've found his identity by now. HK has a population of 7 million. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. I feel that I can find him for sure. How can you find him? Leave a message? I can leave a message on the wall. I can write down my phone number and email. Wouldn't that be dangerous? Can try both. Open a new email account. And purchase a new phone card. Sai Wan Ho Station Lockhart Road Len Hing Chinese Wine &amp; Spirit Shop This is the Blue House. It was called Len Hing Chinese Wine &amp; Spirit Shop. -It used to sell Chinese wine. -This is just for show. The Blue House is usually closed, but it's open today. -Wong Suet Chung. -Ah Kam? -Haven't seen you in a while. -Hi, Vincent. What are you doing here? We're just here for lunch. Sorry about not replying your email. That's okay. It's just junk mail. I didn't expect a reply. That's right. I'm Daniel, his cousin. -Hello. -Hello. Speaking of the devil that is Mr. Wong. His grandpa was the owner of Len Hing. Mr. Wong is really nice. He would go to universities to do lectures and accept interviews. I was disappointed about last time. Don't be disappointed, we get defeated all the time. The most important thing is keeping the passion. Everyone has his or her own life. You have a job, but I'm a freelancer. There's a big difference, but it doesn't matter. People are waiting for us. Let's go to the Community Center. We're kind of busy. They're wearing the same t-shirt. Did they just go on a tour? Maybe they're just back from another protest. Oh, they were your activist allies. Do they know about your dotted diagrams? Hello, Mr. Wong. Hi. What a coincidence. I'm introducing Blue House to the youngsters. Take your time. -Bye. -Bye. Sinyi: Is it a rush job? SC: Yes. and I'm in a rush to leave. Sinyi: Me too. I have to go home to catch a TV series. Sinyi: Why don't you treat me dinner? Sorry, I have my first class today. I shouldn't be late. What are you taking about? I'm going to learn Putonghua. Putonghua! You don't like to talk, why do you still go learn a new language? Thanks, Headmaster. -What for? -Not charging me for the lesson. Don't mention it. I owe far more to your aunt. Don't say that. This way. Your new boyfriend? I've known him for a long time. -Really? -You can say that I don't know him at all. But I fought for his life. Great. A courageous modern woman. Hello, who's this? Somebody really answered. It's a Mainland girl. Was it you who left your number on the wall? Was it you? That's right. Leaving your phone number everywhere? Are you crazy? Are you a hooker? You stupid Mainland girl. Go back to China. We don't want you in HK. Daniel Wong Are there any pretty girls in your Putonghua class? -No. -How about female teachers? I told you, no. Wait a minute. The teacher from the other class seems graceful. Graceful? You seldom give compliments. I'm getting off work. Let me close the gate. A wax seal, that's quite serious. What is it? I have work to do. Just an air ticket. The agency is professional. Settled. Are you still at work? Are you planning a trip? -Where are you going? -Nice voice. -I'm stepping into the lift. -Have you bought travel insurance? -Not yet. You get it. -I'm going to Taiwan. You're going to Taiwan? That's great. The stuff is cheap and the food is delicious. I haven't been to the place where they shot You are the Apple of My Eye. Nor to Shifen. Going to Pingxi to release lanterns. And to Hou Tong to visit the cats. I'm going round the island. Sinyi: Where is Round Island in Taiwan? Kayin: Round the island? Kayin: It means going around the coast by bike. You know how? Sinyi: Can I learn in three days? Kayin: Ride around Taiwan after learning for three days? You're kidding. Today is the Winter Solstice Festival. I'm sorry that you can't be at home with your family. So let's have some dumplings to celebrate the festival. Eat up. Delicious. Delicious. Do you know where this is? I don't know. Is this Hong Kong? Yes, it's Hong Kong. Have you heard of Daimaru? Daimaru? Is it the Daimaru that's stated on red minibuses? That's right, it says Daimaru. I've been in HK for a while. But I don't know where Daimaru is. So in all the time I've been here I haven't taken a red minibus. No wonder. Daimaru doesn't exist anymore. This photo was taken 40 years ago. Daimaru is Causeway Bay. Daimaru is Causeway Bay? At that time, there was a Japanese department store named Daimaru. It opened in the 1950s. But went out of business 10 years ago. It's a pity. If you are from HK, especially if you live on HK Island, you'd know Daimaru. Headmaster, you must miss Daimaru, right? A long time ago, I used to work there. It's strange, isn't it? Hong Kong in the 1970s is completely different from today. Back then, I was a cashier at Daimaru. It was considered quite a decent job. There's so much I've experienced there. Daimaru Daimaru. What is this? How should I connect the dots? Which one is the next dot? Which one? Bitan Bridge Towngas Resigned. R-E-S-I-G-N-E-D. Resigned. R-E-S-I-G-N-E-D. Resigned, you are a rascal. Your lucky draw prize. Xue: Is it snowing in Changchun? Bamboo: Cao Xiao Xue. Bamboo: You finally got a smart phone. Wong Suet Chung. He hasn't been back for two weeks. Really? Almost three weeks. We Hong Kongers simply walk too fast and find nothing right? Mysterious graffiti Netizens: Is this Art? -Hello? -Hey. Your dot diagrams are being seen in online forums. Not having a love life made you bored? Is that why you drew the solutions yourself? I didn't draw them. Not you? Who else can understand your puzzles? Without numbers, how can anyone connect the dots? You must be kidding me. Did you draw this? I knew it was you. You have to be careful next time. There are many security cameras around the stations. You can go to jail. Don't you feel that these drawings have something to do with the stations? It is the "fish" diagram at Chai Wan station. I found old photos of Chai Wan. Chai Wan was a fishing village. So was Shau Kei Wan. You grew up in the Mainland. So you wouldn't know this. I want to ask. How did you guess that this is the symbol for Causeway Bay? This fire symbol is similar to the Towngas logo in my home. Have you heard Headmaster's story about the gas explosion at Daimaru in 1972? Explosion at Daimaru in 1972? At that time, the Headmaster was working there. She had to go to the toilet, so she asked a friend to fill in for her. Then the explosion happened. Her friend died. The Headmaster's luck improved after that. If it is the correct symbol for Causeway Bay, the person who drew this, would not be a youngster. Don't do those drawings anymore, you'll get caught. What are you looking at? Do you understand? You don't? Then forget it. Gas Explosion at Daimaru in 1972 Chung. The boss gave me two movie preview tickets for this Sunday at 10,30 am. Interested? -Yes, sure. -Really? Is it because I asked you in person instead of texting you? No, I wanted to see this movie. Slow living Look at this drawing. I got an elephant. I found old photos of Mei Foo and found a place called Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park. It's Dino the elephant. I used to love going to the park to see her. That was a boring movie, right? But this kind of movie is like that. No, it was good. But you were falling asleep just now. Really? Maybe I've been busy lately. Are you busy with freelancing or making New Year visits? I don't do that. My parents are in Canada. Right, you grew up overseas. You must have seen a lot of art films like this. That's an indie film, not an art film. What's the difference between an indie film and an art film? Are you okay? -I'm fine. -Take a seat there. All right. Thanks. Why did you study computer science before taking fine arts? My parents wanted me to study something practical. Are they very traditional? Most parents are like that. I think that way, too. When did you immigrate to Canada? It's okay if you don't want to tell me. I'm just asking, you don't need to say much. It's not a big secret. When I was 11 or 12. Are you gay? What? With your looks and educational background it can't be that you're single, right? Who said I was single? The boss, Gordon. A few years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. That was a big blow. Sorry. Thanks for telling me. It's no big secret. Many friends know about it. Do you have any interesting stories from when you're studying fine arts? Interesting stories? This question sounds like what entertainment reporters would ask. Tin Hau Station Right ahead. It's cleaned up. Those subway staff are quick at doing such things. How come you can remember where all the drawings are? I recorded the information on my phone. Were you the one behind these drawings? I watch a lot of TV, and this kind of plot is not hard to guess. I didn't draw this. I only provided the dots in between. There are dots? Who connected the dots? I want to know, too. So you designed the pictures with dots. Just like the dot-to-dot games we played as children. But I didn't provide the numbers. So how can they connect the dots? How long have you been doing this? Around 8 years ago. When I first came back to HK, I found that there is a big change. Even Lai Chi Kok Amusement Park is gone. That amusement park was a dump. You have nothing better to do than doodling all over the place? Street graffiti is illegal. No wonder your girlfriend dumped you. You studied design. Don't you think these things are meaningful? When you saw this in the news, your reaction was pretty strong. Really? The other people were excited, too. It's something to gossip about. We didn't know what the drawings meant. Everybody said the graffiti contained messages. I think it's against the law. I'm not interested in politics. Let's go and eat. There's a Japanese style Italian restaurant nearby. Drinks are free flow. So it's quite a bargain. My Hong Kong The adventures of Hong Kong This is Hong Kong Fluorescent paint U Lam Terrace City Boundary 1903 One for each of us is not enough. Well, just a little snack. You should buy more. Yin has appendicitis and she's in the hospital. I have to go visit her. Xiao Xue, can you fill in the night class for her? No problem. Shum Ho? If you're here, there must be some food around. -It's true. -Of course. -Egg tarts. -That's right. -Still warm? -Yes. We're rushing to the hospital. I was getting egg tarts for you. Which hospital is Yin staying at? Hello, my name is Cao Xiao Xue. You can call me Miss Cao. Your teacher Yin is in the hospital. Don't worry, she is okay. I'm filling in for her for the near future. I'm going to take attendance. I'm not familiar with your faces. So it's possible to sign in for others. I'll start from the bottom of the list. Present. Wong Suet Chung. I'm usually the last one. In pinyin, your name would start with H. So you wouldn't stand out so much. Next one. Invisible paint Bowen Road City Boundary 1903 Actually your passport is about to expire. Do you know you can't cycle here? That's why we're pushing the bikes. We'll start biking on Bowen Road. -Where are you going? -To the Peak. Honestly, what's that got to do with you? I'm an off duty police officer. You're a cop. Can you show us your ID? Stop fooling around. Let's go. We're pushing, not biking. Go faster, or he'll use pepper spray on you. Sorry. To Cupid Stone Miss Cao, how are you? This is your teacher? The graceful one? She just switched to our class. Moss Graffiti Do you still do Feng Shui and those geomancy tricks? Not any more, I've become a Christian. Really? Stop playing games. They are showing Big Blue Lake. I have to watch it. That movie is boring. We're having a Derby match. You are still keeping these antiques? No wonder you need the whole room to keep old stuff. My dad didn't want them, so I kept them. Mister. You're talking to the wall, I can't hear what you're saying. Wong Suet Chung. You invited us here, but you keep drawing on the wall. That's so rude! -Sign here please. -All right. Be quiet, please! Take a look at the screen. Graffiti Wong Suet Chung. How do you pronounce these two words? Tu ya. This is tu ya. Tu ya. Let's pronounce it together. Tu ya. Tu ya. -Tu. -Tu. -Ya. -Ya. Let's read it together. Ya. Ya. It's an entering tone. Tu ya. Tu ya. Bye. Headmaster. How is your health? Headmaster. I didn't get a good rest over Easter holidays. Plus the weather has been unstable. You shouldn't put away your winter coats before the fifth month of the lunar year. Even though you are from Jilin and HK is not that cold, you should still take care. Fat Man and I were worried about you at first. Because you don't really get on with the other Mainland colleagues outside of work. Inspection Sorry, I was having dinner with my boss. Did you Whatsapp me? I was going to play a second round with her. I have planned out all the dotted diagrams. But she was one step ahead of me. You mean, she did the drawings on every wall? Yes. At every station, on the same wall? That's too much of a coincidence. They're not exactly the same. About 80%. What about the topic? About half are the same. I took some pictures to study at home. How about the paint? It's the same kind of spray paint, even the same transparent kind. She thought of all my ideas, so clever. You two are a match made in heaven. But it could be a man. I don't think so. Her drawings are lower than mine, which means she's shorter than me. Her dots are all about the same size. And girls are more meticulous. So I deduce that she's a woman. You and I are both around 6 feet tall. Most people are shorter than us, including men. I didn't expect her to make the first move. Perhaps I've been too self-centered. You are self-centered. Aren't you the same? I'm not the same. I'm more selfish. But you've been self-centered since you were a kid. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Where is nine? Where? Did you get arrested? I bought an invisible spray paint. I bought it online, it's really good. I think he would buy the same kind. Because there are not many choices. You are crazy. How can he see the drawings if you use invisible paint? Remember the first time we played these games? When we were young, your uncle brought us old HK magazines back to Changchun, remember? The Children's Paradise -Yes. -What happened to those magazines? My mom threw them away a few years back. You gave me a copy of The Children's Paradise. The April 1971 issue. It's old, but I've kept it. -Really? -I only have this one copy. I could send it to you. If there are no numbers, no order, can we draw the pictures? We can try. The Children's Paradise April 1971 Suet Chung, you can't take them all to Canada! Pick a few. They won't go to waste. The garbage lady would recycle them. For Suet Chung, from Auntie Wai-fong I want this done soon. When is soon? Today is June 1st. Within this week. Thanks, handsome. Sinyi: Movie premiere the day after tomorrow. Interested? SC: I have to go to Victoria Park. Sinyi: You don't look like the sporty type. SC: The park is not just for exercising. Sinyi: It's okay. I heard our firm is downsizing? SC: Really? Don't be nosy. Sorry, I'm late. Have you waited long? Hurry. You always ask me to drive you around. This is the last time. You're wasting my off day. Where are we going? Shenzhen? Tuen Mun or Yuen Long? Yuen Long, thanks. Jing Shen is different from Jin Tian. Jing Shen. Jin Tian. Jin Tian. Not going home today. Yes. Shen Jing. -Shen Jing. -Shen Jing. Shen Jing Bing. Xiao Xue, those two are? Headmaster. Those two were Yin's students. Did I not teach them well? I have a cold. I don't know why, but my head hurts. You should rest if you have a cold. Otherwise, you'll infect others. I'm very happy with your performance. But I have a strange question. Do you not like teaching? Do you not enjoy it? I have not seen you smile in class. Not even once. You seem to like drawing. I've seen you working with Fat Man on Photoshop. You incorporated your own drawings with your teaching materials. Your drawings are of professional standard. I've liked drawing from a young age. When I was in school, my grades were good. My classmates voted me as the class rep. And so you couldn't say no. Now that you're in HK, it's different. You can do what you like. You can chase after your dreams. You can switch to part time here. Then, you can go find jobs that you like. There'll be no problems with your visa or lodging. What do you say? Headmaster, you are so good to me. Smile, you look prettier that way. Shida Xue: He appeared. Bamboo: Did he connect the dots? Xue: Yes, he got it. Xue: I'm going to check other stations. Austin Station Last train - 0046 Bamboo: Still not home? Xue: Not yet, rushing for the last train. Sir, what are you doing? -Drinking water. -Drinking water? What time is it now? You're drinking water here? Can't I drink water? You can, but you look suspicious. How do I look suspicious, officer? Drinking water here in the middle of the night is definitely suspicious. You're here in the middle of the night, too. Aren't you suspicious, too? It's different. I'm here on duty. How is that suspicious? I'm just drinking water, but I'm not suspicious. I can always drink water in public places, no? You can check my ID or search me. But don't call me suspicious. Calm down, you look like a decent person. This place is quite deserted, so I'm just worried for your safety. It's the middle of the night, and the police is on duty. And there are plenty of workmen over there. How dangerous can it be? People are not scared of the police anymore these days. You are better at talking than I am. Scared of the police? Why should we be scared of the police? -Okay, calm down. -We pay your salaries through taxes. Why should people be scared of the police? -Officer, please tell me. -Officer. -What's going on? -Did you get your wallet back? -Is he your friend? -I'm sorry. He dropped his wallet so he's in a bad mood. Get in the car. You better keep an eye on him. All right, officer. Sorry, officer. I've never seen you like that before. Are you okay? Why did you say I lost my wallet? He could have been checking my ID. Your ID? It's right here. My ID is here... How come? Oh, I'm lucky. Did you finish your drawing and leave a contact for her? I have just finished when the police appeared. The first round, she responded to my drawings. This round, I responded to hers. The next round, we'll leave our contact information. What's the next round? Peak tram or light rail stations? How about tram stations? You're such an idiot. I have bad news for you. Your parents will be coming to HK soon. -So soon? -That's right. I'm really busy at work lately. You're not a kid anymore. There are many misfortunes in life. If you don't like it, tell your parents not to come. I don't care. I've decided to go back to Canada in a couple of years. I know you want to stay in HK. But I beg you, not to live in the 1970s. You're not a child anymore. I can't be bothered with you. Get out of my way. Your mom asked why didn't you buy a house. I told them the flat nowadays are not worth buying. That's right, the prices are too high. It's not a matter of price, but about the quality. Those flats were not built for people like us. They are for the rich Mainland people. I should spend my hard-earned money on things I like doing. Then what do you want to do? -I quit. -What? Is it because they want you to lay off people? Who told you? You can lay off one of the junior girls. Her salary is just a third of some of the others. Unlike you, I can't propose to lay off myself. To fire you and Kayin as well? I talked it over with the boss. He should promote you, and have Byron as your deputy. If you don't ask for a raise, there is money left over to hire a fresh graduate. What about you? It's hard to start over at your age. Didn't I get a new job nine months ago? Don't bother about me. Trust me, this is the best arrangement. If it were someone else, they would have fired me first. Thanks. I can't believe you're leaving so soon. Don't thank me. You've been with the company since the beginning. No one is more familiar than you. And you will be graduated in a year. You're suitable to take up this position. How you know I was studying for a masters degree? I just know. Xiao Xue, it's so late, you're still here? We're locking up. You're still playing that subway game? Did you switch to part time for this reason? Have you asked your parents? I want to try other work. I'm 28 years old. I don't have to ask my parents. Aiya, Miss Cao. Your Cantonese has really improved. But I can't understand a thing you said just now. Sorry. I'm saying I'm 28 years old. I don't have to ask my parents for permission to change jobs. I've been to many subway stations. I've visited them all. There's nowhere else to go. That's not true. There are still light rail and tram stations. There are many new subway projects. There will be new stations at the end of the year. All for you to play. Xiao Xue, you're back. What is this smell? -Dit da jow. -Dit da jow? You're not from HK, so you wouldn't know. I know. I know, too. This is Alan, he's a designer. Hello. Hi. Xiao Xue, you have a parcel. You can collect it at the post office. Thanks. You seem like you're in a good mood. -Why? -Because you're smiling. Really? Did I smile? Can we pretend we're reading the newspaper? It's quite sunny here, right? However, this is a land reclamation for the construction of the new airport. All the traditional wood industries around this area have disappeared. The station here is called Sunny Bay. It's called Yan O in Cantonese. Yan is 'delight' and 'O' means a big inner bay. But originally, it's called Yam O, but Disneyland thinks it is not happy enough and too negative. So it changed to Yan O. Yam in Mandarin, it's called Yin. You've heard of Yin-Yang right? So Yin O, basically in "Negative" Bay. Or "Dark" Bay or "Grey" Bay. Something like that. How about "Cloudy" Bay? Yin for Yin Tian. Yeah, it's actually good. "Cloudy" Bay turned to "Sunny" Bay by Disney. Thanks, miss, it used to be really beautiful here with all the floating woods, right? Yes. Lady, are you a local here? Of course not. I speak Putonghua, of course I'm not local. You know the best place to go, so, she's more local than Hong Kong people. So what brings you here? Cecilia Cheung's song. "A Different Me". I've seen her music video. At this moment, I'm no longer myself The sky is the limit, I've exceeded my own imagination Sorry, let me explain a bit. What she was talking, was about a old Canto pop. The music video was shot here. At that time, there was still floating wood. ROUND 3 -Hello? -Hello, Ah Kam. Wong Suet Chung, what is it? Of course I remember. It's just a few years back. You talked about slow living. Of course that's a good thing. It's hard to operate a NGO these days. But if you devote yourself full time to it, there might be a chance. Yeah. Seoul is declared as a Slow City last year. Let's meet and chat. Kowloon East Post Office The Children's Paradise RECYCLABLES COLLECTION BIN City Boundary 1903 There's police everywhere. What is it? Where are you? I'm in Kennedy Town. You're doing those drawings again? Not yet, trying to find the right spot. The sunset is nice today. I'll go check it out. Bamboo: I saw your fifth boundary stone. Bamboo: Have you found the sixth stone? Xue: It's right here. Bamboo: Really? City Boundary 1903 Xue: A hundred year old landmark is next to a trash can. Bamboo: Found all six stones. Bamboo: Is something magical going to happen? Suet Chung, how are you? Xiao Xue, what a coincidence. How could I bump into you here? Yeah, such coincidence. Do you come here often? Not often. But this is a special place. This is the only spot in HK where you can be right by the seaside. Close to the traffic while watching the sunset. You see, the waves are big. Your Putonghua has really improved. Your Cantonese has also improved. It's great to watch the sunset like this. Yes, not bad at all.
