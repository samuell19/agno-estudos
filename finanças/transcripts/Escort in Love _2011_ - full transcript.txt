Feel how I feel the feeling The feeling I'm feeling I'm feeling the feeling I don't want a string quintet! I asked for an Eros Ramazzotti cover band because we listened to him when we dated. My husband doesn't want five mummies torturing us with Vivaldi! Hold on. There's an immigrant who thinks he's in Formentera. Florante, I don't pay you to sunbathe in the garden! He can't hear. Florante. What the fuck are you doing? Sorry ma'am. -Sorry. I was working… -Yeah, right. Go pick up my son from school. He'll be out in 15 minutes! Here she is. Alice Bottini. Age 33, a villa with pool, three servants and a SUV. She's very tense because she's having a crisis. Listen, Imene. My name's Jimena. Imene, Jimena… Same thing. This isn't Machu Picchu, it's Italy. We eat Italian food. No to guacamole, yes to sausage. It's not complicated. Yes, ma'am. Hello? Still there? Sorry. They're foreign. We don't understand each other. Her son Filippo is learning the tough rules of life, cutting his teeth at a private school that costs 1,350 euros monthly. Plus tax. Bravo. This is one of the 50 daily texts he sends Pietro. He's much more than a father. He's an entrepreneur. Gentlemen… get ready. I'm about to show you… the double toilet, otherwise known as "The wedding dream" and also known as "The double dream". Genius! Genius. Genius. Excuse me, what are we talking about? The double toilet, Graziani. I just told you. "The wedding dream!" What? The crapper's my only safe haven. Why should I bring my wife? Giulio has been having crises since he was little. His colitis began on May 10th, 1981, when a ref disallowed Turone's goal in the Juve-Roma game. He hasn't recovered since then. And neither have I. Damn it! Please, Giulio. The next time I ask for a ride, say no! Understand? Chill out! Well? The guests will be here in ten minutes! Sorry, ma'am. The bus never came. Listen, Gandhi, don't play dumb with me. -I'm from Pakistan, not India. -Good for you. Now please go to the kitchen and heat up the pies. Great way to treat workers. Congrats! You should be a union leader. Do I know you? Right. Then do me a favor. Get lost. I have no time to waste. Know what your problem is? Your dress. For Alice anniversaries, birthdays and name days are a great opportunity to invite high society Romans. Watch out, idiot! I didn't see you, sir. What's going on? Mr. Margiotta, I'm mortified. Aziz, apologize immediately. Sorry, sir. Sorry, my ass! Gino, don't do that! You look ugly when you get angry. Right? And it's a shame because usually… Ok, we're going to eat some nice fried cheese. Yes, Eva. Look at Eva! Well? Excuse me. What's that cover girl doing with Shrek's cousin? -You don't know? -She's an escort. No way! Really? An escort? Disgusting! I wouldn't be caught dead doing it with him. Of course not. I'd rather go to work. Eva is really beautiful! An escort by vocation. She bought a penthouse by the Colosseum. In cash. What can you do? Her job pays well. She probably got 1,000 euros to accompany that fatso. -That much? -And even more. Up to 5,000 on weekends. Mr. Pietro, ma'am. Love? -Where are you? -I just finished the meeting… Just now. Right now. Ok, but everyone's here. I'm alone and don't know what to do. -Don't worry. I'll be right there. -Hurry up, love. Dear friends… we are here gathered today… to say goodbye to a fellow citizen. Pietro… was a man everyone loved. Mom, who's that? Nobody, love. Some crazy woman. Listen to the priest. Don't get distracted. As a child, Pietro locked himself in the bathroom. For hours. Everyone wondered, "Why is he locked in the bathroom?" He was already creating. He experimented in his magical world with sinks, toilet seats and flushers! Pietro was predestined, an innovator! That's why we miss him today. That is why I miss him. Here he is. Attorney Bompadre… in his original funeral attire. His specialties? Commercial law… and making an ass of himself. Alice, it's really bad. Your husband left a heap of debts. What are you saying? That's impossible. He was a genius, Alice. -Thanks, Peppe. -He was a genius. -Thanks, Davide. -He was a genius. -Thanks, Alfredo. -A genius. Thanks. The Circeo house will be auctioned. Just like stores, warehouses and cars. Alice? My wife wanted to say something. -Sure. -My condolences. Thanks, Cristina. Thank you so much. The problem isn't just money. As sole director, you're responsible for everything. And you risk going to jail. Big deal! Nobody goes to jail in Italy. Last year you negotiated for two and a half years. If you're condemned, there'll be no suspended sentence. You will serve time. I did not negotiate! What do you mean? Pietro had you sign the proxy so you wouldn't worry. Don't you remember? It was to pay fewer taxes. This morning I talked to Semprini from the finance company. He said he wants his money back. One hundred thousand euros. -Really? -He's a shark. If you don't pay within six months, he'll report you for bankruptcy fraud. -Straight to jail. -Mother of God! At that point social services will take away your son. -Not Filippo. -But they will. Neither you nor Pietro have relatives. You must find the money. It's the global crisis. I made some investments and… We rented a boat so we can't… Not a cent for you! -Forget it! -You can die. Alice who? After two months of agony, finally Alice… collapsed. If you don't pay up, I'll call the union. Thanks for your support. I need my salary too, ma'am. -You're calling the union too? -If you want, I will. Excuse me, ma'am. Where are you sleeping tonight? I don't know yet. You and the boy can come to the building where I live. There's a rooftop pad. Great services. The price is very low. Needless to say. Where exactly do you live? -Yo! -Yo! Hi, Diego. Where's your dad? Dunno. Lionello! What's this shouting? Aziz, I told you so many times. Don't call me Lionello. For you, I am Mr. Doorman. I'm sorry, Mr. Doorman. She's here for the rooftop pad. I'm going to work. Bye. Lionello Frustace, seventh generation doorman. For such occasions he has three cult phrases he's been using for 20 years. They come to Italy and think they're boss. That's the first. The second's more refined. They think they can do what they want in our country. With the third, he'd win the elections. I'd kick their asses out! Are you Italian? Good. The suitcases? Thanks. Should we take them? Lots of bad manners around. I'm not a racist. But black people have been proven to be inferior in terms of brain. In fact, when they went to America from Africa, they became slaves. But we Italians went to America and created the Mafia. It's another level of organization, of creativity. "Made in Italy"! Here we are. Lionello, Retequattro died. My wife's in mourning. My condolences. Tell the manager I'm tired of watching Discovery Channel. Who cares how guinea hogs mate? Guinea pigs. -What did I say? -Hogs. These two intellectuals will soon be her neighbors. But Alice doesn't know yet. Italians. Listen… Where's the rooftop pad? -Is this a joke? -No, it's available. Giulio! Excuse me. I chatted for two hours but have no money to pay. This is an Internet point, not Caritas. I forgot my wallet home. You used that excuse yesterday. At least make an effort and be more creative. My grandma died. -Good! -Thanks. Go before I regret it. What would we be without a friend encouraging us? I don't understand you. You complain we don't earn, then you give everybody credit. Biagio, it's the big contradictions of the human race. For example, I don't need you to run this place. But I keep you anyway. How do you explain that? In fact, I don't. Hello. I'm looking for Aziz. Guys, get Aziz. The lady has to heat the pies. -Is Aziz here? -Hi, ma'am. -Like your apartment? -Yes, very much. Thanks. -The shack of my dreams. -Goes without saying. Listen, I… I need a job. People like you work? I wasn't talking to you, was I? Maybe Mr. Giulio can give you a job. No, Aziz, you got it wrong. Mr. Giulio's up shit creek. The store's in the hole. I'm debt-strapped and I may even have to fire you. -And so? -And so, no work. Welcome to Italy. We need an expert in problem solving, management control. Organizational behavior, international business law. Understand? You must answer the phone, send faxes… and sometimes come to my office… and be nice to me. We mostly do children's parties. We have them do somersaults, sing songs, play games… blow raspberries. Can you blow a raspberry? So, I give you the goods and you sell it at schools. It's all good stuff. Trust me. I know from personal experience. Want to try it? I really feel the need to clean up this company. It's a challenging job, but we'll give you the right instruments. You up for it? Here you go. -How much do you get? -Seven hundred under the table. -Plus tips. -Big deal! By the time you pay your debt, he'll be in a foster home. You need to make 1,000 euros. -Nobody pays 1,000 a month! -A day! Semprini will come for the money in four months. Ok. Let's do this. Yes. At least you'll be OK for a month. Here. Ok. Thanks. Find a way to earn that money. One thousand a day. Honey. Even if I don't say it, I miss Dad too, you know. I know. We won't be here for long. Mom will get organized and we'll have a nice home. But I like staying here. Really? Yes, it's nice. I can watch the stars at night. It's better than TV. And we can sleep very close. Come here. Honey. Ask them. It is what it is. You can see that. The truth is… -I don't have it this month. -Again? Bonetti, let's be honest. -Did I ever pay my rent late? -Always. Exactly. So you're used to it. Listen, Giulio, enough chitchat. The Egyptian wants to open a kebab stand here. There she is! -What do you want me to do? -What? Give me a little more time. Whatever. Shall I call you? I'll call you! Everything OK? Easy! It's not a laptop. It'll break! In fact, I made a mistake. Thanks and bye. Who is it? Hi, Eva. It's Alice. Yes, come up and wait at the entrance. I'm your super pig! Great! And so Alice went into Wonderland. As Jean Jean Martufal said, "In the obvious, a small novelty. In duty, a big surprise." What happened? Eva, I'm mortified. I broke your frame. Don't worry. It's OK. Is that you as a child? -Yes. -Cute. -Your parents seem nice. -They kicked me out of the house. I'm sorry. They didn't approve of my work. -I bet. -What? No, I mean… Thanks, Eva! See you next week. Who's that? Superman. -Wow. You're cute! -Thanks. I liked badly dressed women. Faster than light! You should see him when he does Hulk. He does Hulk too? Nice. Mind if I apply some seaweed while we talk? Of course not. It's not easy to do this job. I know, but I have no alternative. You need a strong stomach, a good sense of humor… and the right body. For example, what are you like? Let me see. Well? -What? -Get undressed. Hurry! Forgot your boobs at home? You're not so busty. Me? It's not about me. I'm successful now. Too bad we have little time. I have an amazing plastic surgeon friend. But then again… I think body isn't everything in life. Buddha, for example. His body was what it was, but his brain was like this! Listen, should I take off my panties? You call those panties? Anyway, yes. Away with everything. -Oh, God! -What? What's that? I haven't waxed in a while. No, sweetheart. You've never waxed! You need an earth-mover. Look, Alice, I'm sincere by nature. On the whole, you're cute. You're really something, but… You're lacking sex appeal. You don't have it. -Fine. -What are you doing? I made a mistake. I don't know why I'm here. No, I'll help you. One of the teachings of the great Siddhartha is: "One must have compassion for everything." Alice. I feel compassion. -Thanks. -See you tomorrow at three o' clock. Don't come earlier. Meeting with the Japanese. MY GREAT LOVE Extraordinary! Friends of My Great Love, we're at Quarticciolo in Rome! Can you tell me where Biagio Alessandrini is? Well, Biagio is in there. Great. Very good! So, friends, let's enter this place. Watch out. Let's tiptoe into it. Here we are. Degradation, poverty, filth, immigrants. But look, here's our dear Biagio. How are you? Fine, thanks. Let me tell you that last month Biagio found out his girlfriend Sofia cheated on him with a rugby player, who isn't even first string. -Adding insult to injury! -That's my business. But there's good news. Sofia realized she made a mistake. She's still very much in love with Biagio so she turned to us at My Great Love. Shall we watch the video that Sofia sent you? -No. -Great. Let's watch it. Biagio, my little potato, I hurt you… but I ask for your forgiveness. He was just a stupid physical attraction. His muscles fascinated me. Wild sex tempted me. The quantity seduced me. But ironically all that quantity… left a huge void inside. I miss you. I miss your lightheartedness, your contagious cheerfulness. Remember at the Biopark when we insulted the hippo? Fatso! You know cheaters never strike only once. -Come back to me. -Don't give in. -I want to make love to you. -Imagine her with the rugby guy. Scrummaging together. And he scores. Bye, my little puppy. I love you. Bye! Better little, but good. Bye! Look, friends, this might be the magic moment of forgiveness. Biagio, what do you want to tell Sofia at this very moment? Slut! Great! Biagio isn't ready for this yet. But his friends are here. What do you think of Sofia? Isn't she sweet for trying to win over Biagio's heart again? No, she must die. In the Cheyenne tribe, they used to shave the belly of fatsoes to humiliate them. Did you know? Go on a diet! -Enjoying yourselves? -Hi, ma'am. Here, love. We're going to the beach on Saturday. Come with us. The free beach near the purifier. Why not? Leptospirosis? Mom, let's go. Please! No, honey, we're going to your grandparents' on Saturday. But they're all dead. Yes, but we can go on a picnic. At the cemetery? We'll say hi to their tombstones. What fun! Please! Love, we'll see. It depends on work. You found a job? Maybe. What job is it? You ask so many questions! I won't say anything, don't want to jinx it. Ok, first of all, you'll have to deal with all kinds of people in this job. There will be entrepreneurs… actors… lawyers, sports figures. Rich people, basically. You'll especially meet many politicians. Some advice. If they're right wing, laugh. Laugh at whatever they say. They like to think they're fun. "Right wing, laugh." Instead, if they're left wing, nod continuously. They need to feel intelligent. "Left wing… need to feel intelligent." Whatever you do, remember you have one objective. Money. One more thing. Never fall in love on the job. I won't fall in love with a man who goes with whores. No offense. Ok. Let's go. Let's see if I can perform this miracle. What? A transformation! Oh God! The look was right, so it was time to start boning up. "All Over My Mother." "Fucks Before the Exams." "Silence of the Clams?" No, that's terrible! "Screwvatar!" In 3D! Out of this world! Don't miss it. You got "piggie pig"? Very nice! You did a lot of shopping today! Alice needs to get started. You know how it is. I only have only ten euros. Don't worry. I'll lend it to you. I'll deduct it from your first pay. By the way, Dennis, I need your help for my girlfriend. -Will you take care of it? -Sure. You… Go get undressed. I'll give you a shoot. What do you mean? You like the camera lens? Give me a horny look. Come on! More to the right. That's it! Expose that thigh. That's it. More sluttish. I said more sluttish! Do we really have to do these photos during a tornado? Shut up, whore! Pout for me. Pout. That's it. Come on! More! Apply yourself. Come on! That's it. Good girl! Good! Stick out your tongue. Roll it around. Like this. Good girl! More or less. That's it. Come on. I feel like a slut today! Lucky you! Let's climb up the mound of Venus. Yes, let's climb-- What are you doing? No wonder men become gay. I'm embarrassed. Honey, you've got a pussy but don't deserve it. Dude, don't worry. I'll work on her tomorrow. Giulio! What is it, Marcelo? I can't pay. My brother-in-law died. How did he die? Indigestion from mussels. -Good. -Thanks. Giulio. Lionello and Giulio had never been on good terms. Their arguments were like sporting events for the neighborhood. You made Italy a brothel! All you do is pay women. Pimps! I pity you! You still have Che Guevara's poster in your room! Put up a nice naked woman, you fag! Yeah! Shame on you, eating everything up! Eat this too! You act so Democratic. I'd like to see you with a Lazio fan son! You speak of a pure race, of cleaning up. Start cleaning the stairs. They're filthy. Pig! Pig! I like Antonella Clerici. So what? Antonella! Pig! But they respected each other. -What do you want? -Alice is working at Decathlon. She asked me to watch the boy, but I have to run an errand. What should I do? Keep him a couple of hours. -All right. -Thanks. Mom left a snack for you. Don't let these pigs steal it. Which team do you cheer for? There are three categories of men. Real men, half men and those without balls. Real men don't need to pay a woman. Half men pay women, but try not to be seen. -Ok. -Then men without balls… They would do anything to be seen with a beautiful girl. Hey, thanks to them we earn heaps! How do you do it? It's easy, you know. You just make their mouths water. Here. Hold these. Wow. You knocked them dead! It's all about using your weapons well. But I don't have those same weapons. "Don't despair. Raise your spirit and find the strength." Krishna said that, not any old asshole. -Weren't you Buddhist? -Not today. I've just discovered Hinduism. Another planet. Let me show you. Hey, excuse me. Two coffees. Steaming. Right away. See? This is man. Essentially a dumbass. You just look at him… like this. And he begins to stutter. He wants you frivolous, dreamy. They're content to pay for it. Alice, remember. To be a real escort, you must be sensuous. Siempre. Siempre. Coffee. Thank you. A splash… of milk? God! -Me too, please. -Hold on! See? Even drinking coffee can be an erotic experience. An extraordinary one. Alice, remember. Look. And walk. Right. Walk past him and drop this, like I did. -Ok. -Go. No, wait! Take your jacket off. Well? -What? -My lighter fell! Won't you help? Can't you pick it up? What a hick! If you can't walk in heels, don't wear them! What a boor! He's a boor. You boor! Morena, age 30. We're generous. Very sensual and captivating. Like it? Why Morena? You don't want to use your name. Mine isn't Eva. It's not? What's your name? I only tell it to real friends. -Sorry. -May I? Perfect body. Irresistible lips. Double D cup. But I wear an A cup. We must attract the prey to the den, idiot! When a man is horny, he'd screw a night table. How satisfying. Available from ten to midnight. Dinners, weekends, trips. Here, your new business phone. So you'll always be available for your clients. Dirty Morena, you're now officially on the market. Still obsessed with the Maldives or Cape Verde? Why go around the world when you have Ostia near home? Oh God! Eat something. Damn it! Kid, I'm fed up. It's the third time! What a lout! Attention! Attention, all swimmers! What's going on? Did someone drown? No, worse. Much worse. I wanted to say that I'm still in love with you, Biagio! Yes, Biagio! He's my little puppy! The handsome guy with curls! I'm sorry, love. I made a mistake! I hurt you! I didn't mean to. After all, it was only a one-time mistake. Two, at the most! But now I… Biagio, don't fall for those grandiose gestures. How do you think she got that boat? She performed sexual services for all the fishermen. Trust me. I know you still love me. Because our love is great. It's greater than the sky! I LOVE YOU, PUPPY For the pilot too? He let her hold his clutch, Biagio. Listen to me. Fuck off! Nice way of treating people. Impressive. Look who's talking. Until yesterday, you snapped fingers to call servants. No, it's different. At times I reprimanded them. You insulted his girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend. You pay for your mistakes. That's how I am. Betray my trust once and it's over. Very Democratic. Never been Democratic. May I have a Popsicle? Too early to get a Popsicle. Why? I want one. Because. My glasses! Don't act like children! No! I have my phone-- Damn you! That'll teach you! No, my phone! You'll pay for this. Hello? Dirty who? It's me. What can I do for you, honey? Of course. Tomorrow at five. All right. Bye, darling. The first-time feelings are the same for everyone. Anxiety, panic, anguish. In this case, add feelings of guilt… shame… other people's judgment. And above all, fear. Toragami says things are always better than what they seem. Almost always. Dirty Morena? My pleasure. Filthy Alvaro. Wow. You're really intriguing! Come in, let's dance samba. Where are you going, nutcase? Eva? Listen, I can't do it. Wearing this wig, going to bed with creepy men. I've only slept with Pietro my whole life. Alice, take it easy. Go home, take a good shower. Then we'll talk about it. There's nothing to say! Look… I'll give you back the money you lent me as soon as I can. We'll end it here. All right? I'm very sorry. Thanks. Bye. Hi, Dad. The new house is cute. The neighbors are funny. I met a friend of Mom's. His name is Giulio. As a kid, he was a striker just like me. Did you know Cheyennes shave their stomach? Sometimes Mom secretly cries. I made sand castles on the beach with Aziz. Dad, I miss you so much. Good thing Mom is here. This time, I'll give you your first client. What's he like? He's OK. I'm Morena. Stefano. Like it? Bye, love. Nice outfit! Are you getting married? Children! Excuse me. -A word? -Sure. I'm Filippo's mom. I wanted to ask you to keep an eye on the boy. -The kids are teasing him. -With that outfit, of course! -But Filippo is very sensitive. -All kids are sensitive. But this is a new environment for him. He was used to a private school. Teachers watched them. While here we leave them on their own. No, that's not what I meant. Of course not. -I do believe in public education. -So much the better. -Ok. Can I count on it? -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Angelucci. I like this place. It's a crossroads of cultures, a melting pot of races. At the end of the day, what matters is the person. White, black, we're all the same! Who is talking? Who is it? "White and black. We're all the same?" Is this a Nanni Moretti film? I wish! Is this a Nanni Moretti film? Is this a Nanni Moretti film? You deserve Nanni Moretti! You deserve Nanni Moretti! Let me sing With my guitar in hand Let me sing I'm an Italian Filippo, they're here! Handsome! -Why this concert? -The neighborhood party. We do it every year. Bruschetta, watermelon, then everyone on stage. -Can I sit here? -Hell yeah! What did you sing, Biagio? A song by Laura Pausini. "La solitudine". To underscore the irony of the neighborhood. Come on! You know it? Come on! What a beautiful evening, ladies and gentlemen! A beautiful performance. Maybe "Bingo Bongo" would have been better for you. Just kidding! Have a seat. Ladies and gentlemen, people of Quarticciolo, the evening has come to an end. But first of all, we thank… the beautiful Tiffany Rasponi! Beautiful! Ladies and gentlemen, I shouldn't say it, but I will. I can't help it. This girl is participating in the selection of Big Brother! See you next year! Excuse me! Be quiet, calm down! I'm here to say someone had her heart set on singing a song. Who would that be? Her name's Alice. Is he crazy? Come on! -I'm embarrassed. -Come on! No, Filippo, don't you start now. Everyone's looking. Go do it. Alice! A great change of plans tonight! I said you'd pay for it. Bastard. What will you sing? Do you know Pino Daniele's "Se mi vuoi"? Great! Ladies and gentlemen, Alice with "Se mi vuoi"! Applause! No, wait. No, it's a duet. I need a backing vocalist. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll end the evening with a magnificent duet! -No, you're wrong! -Are you afraid? -Me afraid? -Go on! Unbelievable. First the woman and then the man. If you want me I am exactly like you I can give you all that I have But… Your turn. If you want me Who wants you? Your sister! Try asking me for a caress To find out That fear is a certainty Together now. It grows and will grow This anxiety that unites us It passes and will not pass That moment that grows I love you still Loving you still Timelessly After the brilliant singing performance, Alice resumed her new activity. Eva kept passing on her best clients. You like it? Artists… It's a shout against war. Madness of violence… that meets the flesh. Do you feel the madness? I feel the flesh more. Men of culture. "Be quiet. The sun is rising. Where the fuck are you running? Death is here!" State representatives. How do you earn your salary? I steal. -Meaning? -I steal. I take citizen's money and use it to buy villas, cars, boats. I have three boats. This is public money. So you're part of the financial bill. Are you happy? Don't you feel guilty? As it turned out, things weren't going very badly. Double Harken! Rotating tits! Throw components! Oh God, Sergio! I think I tore my ligament. Well? -What? -I was bad. Punish me. Humiliate me. Insult me. -What should I say? -Whatever you want. Imbecile! More! Blockhead? Whatever. Just whip me then. What's this? Excuse me, sir. I'll just be a minute. That too? -Hello? -Mrs. Bottini? -What happened? -Your son punched a school mate. No, what are you saying? He's sensitive, huh? Listen… Don't you dare! Filippo has always been a very good boy. He's probably tired of being made fun of by those loots! -Sorry if I exist. -Shut up! Yeah, beat me up! Mrs. Bottini, Filippo is a very aggressive boy. He obviously learned this at home. Call me what you will, but I'm not an aggressive person! I'm a bad boy! You instead should learn to be a teacher once and for all! Understood? Hurt me! Hello? Hello? She hung up. Bitch. If you want to make another call, it's fine by me. What are you doing? Beer? Filippo is sleeping. Shall I call you? Stealing in your store? Stealing what? Computers from 1989? You? I can't sleep tonight. You have no idea what happened at the store today. Marcelo's excuse was that his wife died. What else is new? While he was saying it, his wife came in. He threw himself on the floor, yelling, "Miracle!" You gotta be kidding me. Can I buy you an ice cream? No, thanks. I can't. Ok. Some other time? -Goodnight. -Goodnight. Excuse me. Can I use the computer? Sure. Thanks. I was looking at the Tokyo stock market. You're not Italian. You speak very good Italian. I've lived here for 15 years. You South Americans learn our language immediately. -Actually, I'm from Senegal. -Great. May I compliment you? My compliments. Hasta luego! Giulio, it's the second time you stand me up. If you don't pay within 40 days, I'll kick you out. Come on. We're friends, aren't we? Friends? This isn't Facebook. I don't know you. One of these days I'll change the lock and leave you outside. Here. Find the 20,000 euros. The government is optimistic. Italy is finally coming out of its crisis and is recovering economically. I saw you! Eating outside tonight? Yes, I have guests. You know what? I'll call Tiziana. We'll eat together. I don't think I have enough food. I didn't get much. -I'm on a diet. -No problem. I'll bring wine and stinky cheese from town. But we'll be talking about work. What? Why? We'll have great fun tonight. I'll call the others. I'll bring my guitar. This cheese really stinks. Hey, pass the wine! May as well stick your face in it. Let's get drunk tonight. You're a pile of lard! It's good. -The parmigiana is good, huh? -Hell yeah! I like the wine. Locorotondo from Apulia. Locorotondo. How do you know Alice? -We work together. -They're good! He's a fag. You're at Decathlon too? Decathlon? What do you do, exactly? Well, I do everything. I do everything too. -A total fag. -Who will finish the caponata? I like maladjusted people. Great. Excuse me. What does that charm stand for? Om, from when I was Hindu. What do you mean "was"? It wasn't for me. I tried more particular stuff like Osho, Sai Baba, Scientology. They didn't work for me. What about Jehovah's Witnesses? My brother-in-law loves it. I noticed you didn't eat a thing. Are you vegetarian? I'm depressed. I see. Ma'am… this tiramisu is yummy as hell! If a slice is left over, I'll take it home. There won't be any leftovers. Don't worry. There won't be. Can you believe this kid? He's a real son of a bitch! Listen, just out of curiosity, when you inverts like someone, how do you know he's one of you? We have antennas. Obviously, it's easier in a gay club. -But we know any way. -So you approach him. -You say hello and ask for their number? -What are you talking about? I drag him to a dark room and do it without even looking at him. See? It's easier for you people. Normal men must invite them to dinner, give presents, send flowers. You instead just mate like ferrets. You're cool! Fags, but cool. Enzo is a big baby. Even if, to tell you the truth, lately he has matured. But from that point of view, he doesn't… Got it? He says there is no more feeling. Yes, but in my opinion… a man needs to dream a bit. Every now and then you should wear fishnet stockings, a corset. Then get busy with foreplay. For example, are you good at petting? I wear a C cup. Alice! It's been ringing for a half hour. -Thanks. -Hello. Insult me, Dirty Morena. Please humiliate me! Can you hold the line, please? Thank you. Sorry, business call. -I'm going. -Thanks. Piece of shit! Loser! Loser! You're not worth anything. I'll beat you up! I'll break your pinkies! Done. Sorry, it's just that… I got angry. And when I get angry… You like to dance? A butterfly hidden in a hippo. -The baking tin! -I forgot. Beautiful! Bye, dear. Alice, what a night! These loots are a lot of fun. Bye, Alice. Goodnight. -Sorry. -For what? It was supposed to be an intimate dinner, but they crashed it. You're kidding. It was fun! Know what it reminded me of? Picnics at Villa Borghese with Mom and Dad. -The whole family. -Do you miss them? A little. See you tomorrow. There you go, ma'am. Dishes have been washed. Aziz. -Thank you. -Don't mention it. I'm used to it. I meant… Thanks for everything. Goodnight. Goodnight. I'll take him to bed. Thanks. I grew up alone with my mom too. I always had a ball under my arm. Did your dad die when you were a kid? He's not dead. He left with a tobacconist. He left 300,000 Lira on the nightstand and a beat up car. My husband didn't even leave that. I remember when my dad disappeared… we were building a model sail boat. You know those wooden ones? Like Sandokan's. Then he left. We didn't finish the boat. Why didn't you finish it? Those are things sons and dads do together. Now I know why you're always pissed off. Aren't you with your husband? I don't have time to be pissed off. I must think of Filippo. Want some coffee? I won't sleep. I'll wake up early tomorrow morning. Actually, I'd better go. Ok. Then goodnight. Goodnight. Ok. Afraid, huh? Feel justice breathing down your cat neck? Yes, I definitely do, Batman! Quiet! Batman, hold it together. I'll read this message and take you to the Batcave. I'M AT DECATHLON. I'LL COME SEE YOU Who is it? Joker? Sergio, how did you get here? With my Bat scooter. Please, lend it to me. The keys are there. Thanks. Be careful. It's new. Surprise! -Well? -How are you? Fine. And you? I'm working. -Sorry. -Excuse me? We'd like to buy a tent. Good for you. Let's go. -So, how's it going? -Great! -So I see. -It's hard work. But my co-workers are nice to me, the place is lovely, so... Excuse me. Who are you? Salvatore, always joking around! Damn you! Careful, or I won't cover for you when you steal tennis balls! Who would have thought? It's one big laugh here. Good for you. I feel like crying. If I don't find the money, I'm closing in a week. -What will you do? -I don't know. I'm mostly sorry for Aziz. You fired him, now I'm firing him. He'll end up in the street with his family. This way! And Biagio? Biagio's used to suffering. At worst, he'll kill himself. Fuck! What? Good evening. -Hello. -You work here? -Do you work here? -Yes, sure. Good. You can give us information. Meanwhile, this is Giulio, a dear friend of mine. My pleasure. Filippo's teacher. My husband. Andrea. Hello. Hello. Can you tell us how this thing works? Of course. So… This is an abdominal apparatus that you use for high abdominals. In fact, it's called Abdominatrix. It is very easy to use. It most probably works like this. Sorry. What for? Alice, what's wrong? I need some air. Do you feel sick? I mean, yes. Listen, Giulio, it was really nice the other evening when we… Kissed. It was so beautiful. But… we can't carry on. You said it was beautiful. Why can't we? Why can't we carry on? Because you… Because you're nice. I like you. I really like you a lot. I like you too. But I don't… Right now I really can't have a relationship. Understand? I don't want to be hurt and above all don't want to hurt you. Who's hurt? I'm not. Now you're not. But later? Later we'll see. You never know, though. So just in case… I can't explain it, Giulio. I can't explain. There's nothing to explain. It's fine. -Sure. -Of course. No problem. I'm perfectly fine. I miss you She even screwed Fausto Leali. They call him "the white black". But not for his voice. Enough said. -Alice! -Eva! Why did you have me come here? Happy birthday. No way! Who told you? Dennis can't keep his mouth shut. Happy birthday. Thanks. You got me a great gift. This is not the gift. Mom. What's up with the money? Almost have it all. I heard from Semprini. He'll be pressing charges soon. Don't worry, I won't go to jail. I found you a house near Piazza Bologna. It'll be vacant in a month. You can leave that dump. Ok. Thank you. We'll see. Mommy's love! -Good news! -What happened? -Everyone has measles in class. -That's good news? Saturday I get to play first string. Saturday? Mom won't be here. Mom, I had my heart set on it. Why won't you come? Go, sweetie. Shoot! -Shoot! -Come on! Watch out for number nine! Careful! You'll get my jacket dirty, you shitty Moroccan! Apologize to the gentleman right now. I'm sorry. I wasn't talking to you. -Well? -Well? Apologize. -I must apologize to this guy? -Do it. Baby, you lost a good chance. Let's go, girls. Look, I'm mortified. I apologize for him. You should be proud of being African. Actually, I'm from Catanzaro. But thanks anyway. Goodbye. -Yes? -Hey, Tiziana? -How was the game? -Awesome! They won. Filippo scored. Great! Did he eat? Yes, I stuffed him with spinach. He's stronger than Popeye now. Can you put him on? I can't. He's busy right now. He's playing with his sticker album with two friends. -Did you stick Cassano? -An hour ago. Anyway, Giulio saw the whole game. Then he had dinner with us. Giulio is a really good guy. You're telling me? He's really nice. I know, Tiziana. Lucky the girl who gets him! Understood, Tiziana. I know. Thanks. What time do you close? In a half hour. Too bad. Excuse me. We're closing. Five more minutes! Tomorrow! I'll give you 50 minutes tomorrow! Tomorrow. God. Sorry. Here! -I hurt myself. -I'm sorry. Wait. -We'll break everything. -No, I'm still paying for them. Alice hadn't been this happy in a long time. She was about to participate in a legendary male event. A bachelor party. Oh my! Eva? I must tell you something. What a face! Is it serious? This is my last evening. Are you upset? I'm glad. How come? How come? With all this money, I'll pay the debt and stop. And then? Then what? Giulio has nothing to do with all this? Of course he does! -Damn me! -Girls! First of all, you are lovely. This is for you. Don't forget. You're our wedding gift to him, so make us look good. We paid you lots of money. Come on! We start in five minutes. Excuse me. Can I touch your tit? Ok, I tried. Sorry. The more mercenary, the snottier. Both of them. -All for me? -All for you. Remember all the moves I taught you? You start. My God! Come on! Do you like my gift? I'm unwrapping her tonight! Don't just stand here. Run! What are you waiting for? Run! Where's she going? I'm here! -Giulio! -Get lost! -Giulio! -Again? -Giulio, please! -What do you want? -Let me explain. -Explain what? Look at that. Aren't you ashamed? -Yes, I am. -You should be. Because you're ridiculous. I pity you. -I had no choice. -Shut up! You've been feeding me bullshit! Don't show your face again. Giulio? Giulio, open up! I know you're in there. Look, you can't treat me like this. You want to make me feel bad? I already felt bad even without your help. Should I have told you? Told you what? Told you what? Giulio, talk to me. It's OK if you don't want to see me. But please say something. If you want me Send away This sadness My love Because life goes by quickly Leaving without saying goodbye? I didn't want to bother you. You never bother me. Remember, we can be friends forever even when our lives change us, separate us and are against us. Is that Confucius? The Pooh. Listen. These months have been horrible. The worst of my life. But without you it would have been worse. Thanks, Eva. My name is Fabiana. Nice scene, huh? Touching. Gunther Meyer Ofla said, "A goodbye is just the beginning of a farewell." I don't think it means anything, but I want to believe it. You're wondering how I knew all about this story. Let's say it was told to me by a dear girlfriend. Very dear. Too dear. Perfect. I'll call Semprini and settle it. -Well? -What? You don't ask how I earned it? Who cares? Whatever you did was the right thing. These are the keys of the house I told you about. It's spacious, low rent. But the old lady downstairs gasps for breath. Thank you. So how are you? How do I seem? Unemployed? This is a Japanese restaurant. We are Chinese and we need an Italian waitress who explains to Romans what they are eating. Want to do it? Come on, Filippo! They're not there! One day we'll return and say hello to them. You'll like the new house even more. Surprise! I knew it! Did you think we'd let you leave like that? Give me a kiss. We have pastries too! Sabayon too? Stop eating, start thinking of women. Dad, you still don't get it? I don't like women! What did he just say? Let's toast! Mom, why don't we say bye to Giulio? The bus is here. This is a plot to frame me. I'm an honest man and never corrupted anyone. I'll soon return stronger than before. I want my voters to know that. I'll be back! Little puppy, help me pack this up. Marcelo, it's closed. We have a surprise for Giulio. Giulio, you always helped us. Now we want to help you. We all chipped in so you can pay your debts. But… Thanks, Marcelo. I appreciate it. Thanks, everyone. It's 378 euros… And 20 cents. It's too little? Well, yes. Here are the keys. I gave you everything. Except the money. You're asking for too much. Ok. As long as you leave. Excuse me. -What do you want? -You have a problem. I have no problem. -Who's Bonetti? -Me, why? The amount should be right. Check. -I'd say so. -Give back the check, please. -It's a loan. You'll give it back. -It's not your problem. Excuse me. Take the check back. -Come with me. -You're hurting me. Let me go! You can't do this in front of everyone. I don't want your money. I always earned money honestly, not like you and her. Listen, dude… I might have earned this money screwing, but it can save your ass and your friends' asses. When you love someone, you do things you don't like. Will you take it or not? You and Alice aren't so different anymore. Great job! What's the score? Two to two. Filippo just scored. The kick wasn't that great, but their goalkeeper sucks. Excuse me. Sucks? That's my son! Sorry, I meant it in a nice way. How long till the end? Fifteen minutes. We can still win.
