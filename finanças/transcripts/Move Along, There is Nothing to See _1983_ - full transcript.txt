Take the next left. -Here? -Yes, now. -What street is this? -No idea. Nothing! -There are no signs. Joffre street? -That's it, Joffre. -Are you sure? -Do you want the map? -On your right, but slow down. -I am going slow! That's it. We're there! No, that's it! -We'll go back round. -We're not going back round! -We're going the wrong way. -It's fine, there's Foch! Go to the intersection. We can't turn here! We're not asking the kid. I've got the map, keep going! -Turn right. -My pipe's gone out now! I'm sick of this! I can't find it, there's no street name! I don't have a compass. Shit, be careful! Right there, I said, on the left. I've told you three times already. Take that road. They don't seem short of a buck. We're in Saint-Germain. The rich don't live in Portakabins, maybe only the snobbiest ones. How do we do this? I don't know, at random. You'll do the talking? You're such a pain, I always do the talking. Random selection, old pal! And somehow you randomly always select me. -Quiet, they might still be sleeping. -Then we'll wake them up! Here. -Put that out, are you crazy? -Why? They won't have an ashtray? Listen… Stop it! There are two gentlemen at your door! What? -Worried we'll wake the vacuum cleaner? -Listen… -Don't worry, I've got this. -Leroux, where are you going? Come back here! Leroux, for God's sake! I'm very sorry, but I think someone is at your door. That's what it seemed like from outside, at least. You're not going to open the door? I'll do it, then. Ma'am. Is this the house of Mrs. Duvernet? We'd like to see her because we're from the police, my friend and I. Madame isn't home, sir. She went out to do some shopping. Alright, in that case… We'll… We'll wait for her in the living room. Sorry. Leroux, stop it! Don't start touching everything. Put it back. I'm not, I'm just looking. It's in your hand. Put it back! Leroux, please stop, you're going to break something! Have I ever done that before? -Yes, you have. -Well, who doesn't break things? -They weren't even valuable! -Put it back anyway. Shit! You see? -See what? -You broke it. It's your fault. You annoyed me and I broke it! You've got a nerve! Did I break anything before you annoyed me? There you go! -You really have no respect. -Gentlemen? Mrs. Duvernet? We were just waiting for you. Hello, ma'am. Lieutenant Pélissier. Lieutenant Leroux. How can I help you? Alright… Well… It's about a case concerning… a stolen checkbook. We need to ask you a few questions. Of course. But what does this have to do with me? You see, well… It's that… A check belonging to the stolen checkbook was given to a gas station attendant, who… noted down the license plate, which was, you see, the same as your car, 1986 PY 78… A Golf. Don't you think it's a bit of a minor affair? Yes, of course, it's… Especially as he could have easily written down the wrong number… Your car hasn't been stolen recently? No. In any case, you would know. Yes, how silly of me. Alright… You didn't lend it to anyone? No. And I can't imagine any of my friends handing out stolen checks. Are they for a lot of money, these checks? No, the biggest was for 150 francs. Lieutenant, do you really think I would break the law for such a trivial amount of money? Would you do it for larger amounts of money? Excuse me? I mean for… For larger sums of money, you… I was joking. It was a joke. Don't worry about him, he's not right at the moment. When we came in, we knew you were innocent. Very well. I won't keep you any longer, in that case. Goodbye, ma'am and again, please excuse us. -Goodbye, lieutenant. -Goodbye, ma'am. I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch your name earlier. It's Leroux. Lieutenant Leroux. Really? Like the chicory brand! Goodbye, ma'am. Before we rang the doorbell, I knew this was a dead end. The minute you see her, you know that woman couldn't be caught up in a stolen check case, right? -Know what I mean? -Yeah. And did you see the way she looks at you? I didn't know what to do with myself. -I must have looked like such a schmuck. -Yeah, you did. And you, good job! You didn't open your mouth the whole time. Shit, my keys. Wait, I must have left them inside. Wait a minute! -Don't worry, I'm on it! -No, Leroux! Ah, it's you. Sorry for bothering you again, it's… My colleague left his keys in… I think they're in the living room, and because we can't start the car… -Go ahead, lieutenant. -I don't want to impose. -Not at all. -Sorry. Excuse me. There, I've got them. He left them on the… You're mistaken. Those are my keys, these are yours. Oh, really? I didn't know. Seeing as it's not my car. Sorry. Sorry. I'd better be going, he's waiting for me. Just give me my keys back first. -Yes, how silly of me. -Yeah… We're not really used to it… It's not… -My apologies, the thing is… -Goodbye, lieutenant. …I don't want to bother you. I am really very… OK. Right! What did she say? That's she's nuts about your body and she asked me to set you guys up. You really have no respect, man. -What did she say? -Why do you give a shit? I give a shit because human relations are important. You can tell me what she said. I didn't even see her, the maid gave me the keys. Let's go! Let's go, damn it! Alright, more fuel. Shit, I lost it. I'm out of fuel, Leroux! Leroux, your turn! Leroux? Hold your horses, it's not a factory! Hit the fuel while going fast. Be careful! You have the hit the fuel. There, go on, the fuel! Shit! This is such a stupid game. You're being ridiculous. That's just a waste of money, that is! If your head's not… If your head's not in the game, you're toast. Ah, shit. Shit. Leroux? Leroux? Mrs. Duvernet? Yes, hello again. Lieutenant Leroux calling. Do you remember me? I'm calling because I suddenly realized that it would be a good idea if you could come in and make an official statement. No, there's no rush. Just come in tomorrow, let's say… Tomorrow morning, around nine, five past nine. There's no… Exactly. Thank you very much. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. You're up early this morning. No, I just had some work to do… -I see that. -Alright, listen… Could you go for a walk or something? I'm waiting for someone and I'd prefer to be alone. OK. Is it a sex thing? Come on, be a pal… So you're chucking me out. You really have no respect. Tell me, who is it? Do we know her? Stop it. Please, just get out. You can tell me who it is. It's Hélène Duvernet, the stolen checks. I called her in to take a statement. -That's crazy, what's the point? -The point is that I'm doing my job. You're not right, Leroux. Either you love paperwork or… -Anyway, something's up. -Just leave me be. If she comes, it means she's scared. And if she doesn't come, that's even more suspicious. Something smells fishy to me. I've got a nose for it. You're not right, Leroux. You're being mysterious and you're not right in the head. Keep your police cap on! POLICE STATION You're not allowed to park here. It's on purpose, the car is evidence. Hello. I have an appointment with Lieutenant Leroux. Second office on your right. Hello, lieutenant. You're too good. I've come to give myself in. You're here already? You're early. I'm not bothering you, am I? No, I mean, yes. It's just that… I had some things to do. -Didn't we say nine? -No, you said nine. But it suited me to come earlier, so here I am. What did you want to know, exactly? Um, well… It's to take your statement, write it up, all that… I see. Alright, then. -Just to get it out of the way! -Let's get started. Surname: Duvernet. First name: Hélène. Née Spencer. Address: 7, Rond-point Du Château, Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Profession: owner of an art gallery located at 138, rue Saint-Honoré, 75001 Paris. Are you keeping up OK? Barely, but I'll tidy it up later. There… Very well… No… Also… What else… Ah, yes. Date of birth? November 12, 1947 in London. No need for that, I'm 35. Ah, no, it wasn't to… You're English? How did you guess? My husband was French. "Was"… Are you divorced? -Widowed. -I see. You didn't kill him, did you? Don't worry, I'm just asking… Of course, he was a hateful man and one evening I'd had enough and stuffed him down the garbage disposal. There, you have what you need. As for your report, you can write what you like. Goodbye, lieutenant. Goodbye, ma'am. You were right. It was a great idea to invite her. Leave me alone, will you? Shit! Shit! My car! Hello. You're walking? Did someone steal your car? First door on your left. -Hey, how's it going? -Alright. What did you do? You're unhinged. It's to change things up a bit and I think its nicer like this. You're right, it is nicer. When you retire, you can become an interior designer. -You don't have anything better to do? -No, nothing. Well, yes. I need to talk to you. You've been acting weird recently. First of all, you look rough… You scare me when you're like that. You're not planning more shenanigans, are you? Eh? You hear me? Enough, it's like talking to my mother! You know you can always talk to me, Leroux. You don't want to talk to me? I would love to, but right now I have nothing to say, so why don't we talk tomorrow, eh, pal? You're a pain in the ass. A mysterious pain in the ass. Just like my wife's sister, you never want to talk… Hello, my car was stolen. I would like to report it. You'll need to make a statement. When did it happen? -This morning. -What sort of car was it? It was a Golf. -That's Mrs.… -Duvernet. Hey, guess who's here? -Who? -Your girlfriend. -What do you mean? -The English woman! Suspect number one. What's that got to do with me? -Her car was stolen. -What bad luck. -You're not going to say hi? -Well, I hardly even… Damn, it's twenty past four! I'd better go. Where are you going? Nothing, some bullshit. A shop owner's having trouble. He's being pestered by a gang of dwarfs. Want company? No need, it'll be very short, they're dwarfs. -It's you! -Yes, it's me. What are you playing at? I was pressing my chest because I had a little cardiac alert. Just a little one. I'm better now. Are you jerking me around? Watch out, Leroux! Keep your police cap on! We'll end up in traffic control. Forget about it, they don't make police uniforms in our size, anyway. Go on, get lost! You really have no respect. Jackass. Watch out! Duck! Look at that! -What a surprise! -Hello, lieutenant. Hello, what are you doing in the area? I'm just leaving the station. My car was stolen. I don't believe it! So you only came just now? I mean… -What time did it happen? -Around 9:30 this morning. You should have come earlier, we would have done a radio call. Did you injure yourself? I trapped my hand in your gate last night. Just kidding. There was a knife fight, and the blade pierced the skin but… Horrible. But it's nothing, really. But do you feel OK? You look exhausted. I didn't get a lot of sleep last night. Don't worry about your car, I'm on it. Alright, goodbye, lieutenant. Hey, you know what? You know the latest scheme? Excuse me? Some people, for 1500 francs, they steal your car and burn it somewhere quiet. The owner gets the insurance money, without the risk of them doing it themselves. Are you accusing me of having done that? No, I didn't say that! No. But some people do it. Crazy, right? Ah, yes. Lieutenant, I can't work out if you're sadistic considerate, stupid, or all three at once. Good question! Good question… -How much for this? -Thirty francs. Ah, yes, that's expensive. -And that one over there? -This… This one here? -Yes, the red one. -Forty-two. Ah, it's expensive too. Alright, good luck, sir. A SUCCESSFUL OPENING NIGHT AT THE DUVERNET GALLERY This one is very nice, isn't it? It's my personal favorite. And this one? Ah, yes, I'm very fond of that one too. In fact, if I were to buy one, I'd have a hard time choosing. How much is this one? One second, I'll have to check the catalogue. Morning, everyone. This is a figure, priced at 35,000. And this one is 40,000. It has a slightly larger size. May we have a catalogue, please? Of course. -Sir? -I'm just having a look around. Please, be my guest. Here you are. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Do you like it? Um, yes. It's… It's very colourful, it's… I quite like it. -If you'll excuse me. -Of course. Hello, Hélène Duvernet Gallery. Ah, it's you. Hello. No, it's quiet. This evening? OK, sure. No! Poor thing, that could only happen to you. Alright, I'll pick you up. See you later. Kisses. How much is this one worth? That one is 30,000, sir. -New, of course. -I got that, thanks. And the little one? That one has been sold. It's in pastel. Oh, yes. I didn't have my reading glasses but now I see it's in pastel. Oh well, that's too bad. Too bad. Well, goodbye. Don't you want to sign the visitors' book? Um… Sure. Thanks. -Would you like a chair? -Eh? No. Looking at the paintings you're full of ideas but standing here… Looking at the paper, you feel a bit lost. But… VERY WELL PAINTED -Hey. -Hey. -What's on the menu tonight? -Chicken, lieutenant! We were hoping for partridge, but we had a lousy hunt. -Hey, Martine. -Hey. I was worried, I haven't heard from you in three days. We were super busy and I was really tired… I'll see you later, then? Ah, no. I can't, I'm busy, I've got to tail someone on the outskirts, and you know what it's like. We know what time we'll start, but not really what time we'll… -Are you mad at me? -No. Oh yeah, I wanted to-- -Oh and that was my fault, was it? -Sure looked like it. -I can't talk to my girlfriend? -Go ahead. Move along, pal. Off you go. What did you want to tell me? That I won't be able to meet up this week. I'm run off my feet. That's all you had to say to me? Well, yeah. You're not offended, are you? No, but if you'll excuse me, I'm run off my feet right now. Hello, Ma'am. Thirty-two francs, please. Could you please pass me the salt? And the pepper? Is that all? Would you like me to eat it too, while I'm here? Unbelievable, people have no manners! Lieutenant? Tell your pals at Mondaine to come tomorrow, we're serving eggs cocotte! Cocotte! -Good evening. -Oh, it's you! -What do you need me for? -No, it's for… Are you going out? That dress… No, I like to get dolled up to watch TV. -May I? -No. It's about your car. -I think we've found something. -Really? Did you find the place where I burned it? No, not yet, but… I just a few questions to ask you. Now, isn't this pretty? Listen, lieutenant, I'm already late, I'm on my way out. Can't it wait until tomorrow? No, that's why I came by this evening… I'm leaving in two minutes. Would you like a drink? Yes, that's a great idea. Marc, could you get the gentleman something to drink, please? Hélène, hurry up. They said nine o'clock. Good evening. What can I get you? Martini? Yes, what you're having. Good evening. We've already met, right? No, I don't think so. We did, you came by the gallery this afternoon. You have a gallery? No… Are you kidding? It's not a face one forgets in a hurry. Oh, right… What does that mean? That it's easier to imagine you at a bookie than at an art gallery. Ah, OK. Alright, I'm ready, Marc. Can you help me button up my dress? I see you've made Marc's acquaintance, lieutenant? Lieutenant? That's right, I'm a lieutenant. I am a lieutenant… I inspect finished paintings. I check if it's all well painted, if there's any white showing through… We have to look out for the customer! Say, since you're from the police, do you know Rue Gustave Flaubert? I'm a lieutenant, not a traffic warden. Oh well, we'll look at the map. I won't let you hang around, lieutenant. You'll find the corpse that's hidden under my bed. -Lieutenant? -Yes? If you could be so kind as to close the gate behind us. Be careful not to get your hand stuck. Good evening! Who is that guy? No one, don't worry. Don't be ridiculous, he's a police officer. -What does he want from you? -I don't know! Some story about stolen checks, I didn't understand a thing. And now with the stolen car, he's getting in my hair again. -He's insistent, that's all. -I don't like this. -He came to the gallery this afternoon. -Really? To do what? Nothing, that's what worries me. -Why is he following you around like that? -I don't know! Are you jealous? Yes! Hello? Yes, hello again, lieutenant. Yes… …she's here! Martine! It's Hercule Poirot! She's coming. There she is. Hey, what's up? Is the investigation over or did you just screw up? I'm not angry but I'm not your plaything either. You're so silly. Alright, see you later. -Ciao! -Goodnight. Yes… But what would I do there? Shoot a film. I won't have anything to do there. There's no more cinema there. What? Yes, there is. Do you have any food? -No, I don't think so. -I'm hungry! You could go shopping from time to time. Yeah, but I haven't had the time. You'll get crumbs everywhere, it'll be like sleeping in sandpaper! -You're in a lousy mood. -It depends on the day. Some days I'm in a great mood, but right now I'm really tired, sorry. Wow. I would have loved to live in that era. -Did you see the dresses? -Yes, it's nice. -You're not listening, what's wrong? -I'm listening but I'm reading, honey. It's not polite to read in front of the TV. This is my place, though. I do what I want. -Why aren't you being nice? -I am being nice, I am! No, you're not, you won't talk to me. A kiss. Better than that. With our eyes closed like on TV. I can tell your head's in the clouds. -Should we turn off the lights? -Yes, let's sleep. Leave the TV on, it'll help me get to sleep. THE HISTORY OF PAINTING What are you doing? I can't sleep, I'm going for a quick stroll. -You're being so annoying! -I'm not being annoying, I just… Get up, it's eight o'clock! Don't you have anything to do this morning? Alright, then… I'm coming. What is it? I'm sleeping. It's that policeman again. But this time, he's alone. I'm sleeping! Tell him to come back this afternoon. He says he needs to see you right now, it's urgent. Tell him I'm dead. Madame is dead. She can't see you. You'll have to come back another time. Lousy trick, that. Tell her that I'll wait in the living room until she resurrects. What do you want now, lieutenant? Good morning. As we didn't have much time to talk yesterday, I wanted to find a moment for us to talk in peace. I was going to come by earlier but then I thought "You'll disturb her." You never know. I took your mail while passing by the mailbox. Some prospectuses, bank statements… bills, a telegram. Here you go, sorry. There's also a postcard from Rio. "Beautiful weather in Brazil. Love from your brother…" What else did he say? Ah, nothing much. Here. Lieutenant, I've told you everything I know about those stolen checks. Don't worry, that's old news! The case is closed, we found the thief. -So what do you want, then? -Well, nothing much… Further information, as we say. For us to have a little chat. Can I have my breakfast during the interrogation? I'm not a monster. Let's have some breakfast. I haven't had mine yet, so it's perfect. A little quieter! I have a headache. Sorry. If you went to bed earlier you'd feel better in the morning! Anyway, I don't care, I don't live with you. What? Four in the morning is no time to go to bed. Don't tell me you spend your whole life monitoring my whereabouts! Not my whole life… It's because last night I happened to be on duty in the area, and… No, it was just by chance. Lieutenant? I've known many men in my life. Some have showered me in flowers, some have risked their life for me. They all had different qualities. But there's one area where you beat them all. What's that? Well… You are really… the most irritating. I see. You're just trying to flatter me. Oh, no. I mean it. That's what makes a great cop. I see. Well if this great cop could help me find my car that would be a lot more useful. You're making a real mess of that. That's not the right way. You put two rusks on top of each other and it's much easier. You're such a mother hen, lieutenant. Go ahead and laugh. This mother hen is going to find your car! You don't believe me? I'll find it today, want to bet? By the way… I want to ask you something. The gallery, do you make a living from it? Yes, quite a decent one, why? Do people really buy that stuff? I don't really like it, myself. Lieutenant, I don't have it in me to discuss art with you this morning. So, please, look around all you like. I'm going to have a bath. -I'll feel better afterwards. -Alright. I'll leave you be, then, if you're taking a bath. OK? Alright, I'm leaving. I'll be on my way! Don't worry, I'll see myself out! I'm leaving! Hello, Marc, did I wake you? I just got a telegram from Richardson. He has a buyer for the Modigliani. So you need to get Reska on the phone, and make sure he gets it done in a day. Eh? Who? The cop? No, he's not dangerous. Bye. -Hello. -Hello. Hi there. You have a complaint filed here by Hélène Duvernet, about a stolen Golf convertible. That rings a bell. It must be here somewhere. Don't bother. It's at Rue des Bouviers. Call the owner and tell her we've found her car. Tell her it was Lieutenant Leroux who found her car. -What? What car? -Nothing, forget it. Lieutenant Leroux found Mrs. Duvernet's vehicle. -But you were the one who stole it. -You're crazy! It was just parked there, I was passing by. Good timing. I've just put us on duty with the RER train gypsies. You're unbelievable! For how long? It'll take part of the day. We can have a chat. There's more to life than work. I know, there are human relations as well. What did you bring me today? Two Modiglianis. Where are these beauties off to? Reska, I pay you to disguise the paintings I bring you, not to know what happens to them after. I was just making chit-chat. In fact, I've never been a fan of Modigliani. He's shit. I mean, you could sell it to anyone. -That's ideal. -Modigliani, I reckon he's a phoney. I'm sure if he was alive, this would be worthless. You're so annoying! You say we're just going to Saint-Germain, then we do all the stations! You're not right. I don't know what's wrong, but you're not right. You can talk to me… If you like. I know something's up, you're not right. Come on, I'm fine! I'm sorry but you're not. You're all pale, you're not right. Why don't you tell me what's wrong? I can help you. Alright, listen. My breasts have been hurting recently, I'm worried I might be pregnant. OK. Now… Now you really have zero respect, buddy. You just don't like talking to people. I don't get it. I love talking to people… Confiding in them… For example, right now things aren't going so well with Catherine, it would be nice to talk about it, because Catherine and I… Look, I don't give a shit. I really don't give a shit. That's all. But if you could do me a favour, that'd be great. Cover for me two or three days, I'll owe you one. You're scaring me, Leroux. -What are you plotting? -Nothing! I'm onto something, nothing certain, I want to keep it on the down-low. Don't be an idiot, Leroux. What are you getting us into? Quit messing around. You'll be at the traffic lights with your hat on in no time. You know what it is? I never ask you for anything, you can do this for me. I don't like this. One slice of cake please, Mr. Villiers. Jesus, you're not going to have a dessert now! Ah! You're really not right. Have you heard how you're talking to me? Sorry, it's cheese course then dessert. One slice of cake, it'll take me two minutes. You're so annoying. I'm going to use the phone. Bit of a piece of work, your colleague. He doesn't seem like that when you don't know him, but… I know him and… Yeah, he's a piece of work. You know, it's all to do with… human relations. Hello? Hello. Is that the Duvernet Gallery? Is Mrs. Duvernet there, please? I see. Do you think I could reach her at home? So you're no use. No big deal, I'll call back later. No, I'll call back later. No, I… Right, bye. Come on, you've eaten enough. Get a move on! -You'll die young! -And you'll die fat! -Each to their own, pal. -Goodbye. -Hello. -How's it going? Are you finished? OK, you can start. Honestly, isn't it better like that? Yes, very nice. We can't even have a laugh… Watch out, stand back, it's toxic. I didn't say it was an organized gang but our information all adds up. What's for sure is that they certainly look alike. -I really have to go. -Wait, I'm nearly done. You're doing fine on your own. I've had enough, I'm out. Look, Leroux, I'll be straight with you. Hélène Duvernet isn't for you, just let it go. You've lost it! This has nothing to do with Hélène Duvernet. Don't worry. Be careful, Leroux. Lost his cap, that one. -Your friend seems a bit on edge. -He's not right at the moment. Watch out! -You again! -I'm infuriating, ain't I? That being said, I left you alone all day. What's wrong? Ants in your pants? -Where are you off to? -Pré Catelan. Oh yeah? I'll come with you. Eh? No? Yeah… I'm coming. Damn, you made me run laps! Want me to close the window? You're sweating, you'll catch a cold. No need. I don't look like it, but I'm strong, you know. If you're heading to the bois de Boulogne, I can drop you off. No, not at this hour. I'm tailing you, you see. I'm not letting you out of my sights! You never cease to amaze me, lieutenant. You see, I'm growing on you. I always have that effect. Initially you're a bit surprised but then you get attached. By the way, what do we say about the car? We say: "Thank you, Lieutenant Leroux." Something like that. -Thank you, Lieutenant Leroux. -Ah, that's better! What exactly are you playing at? How long will you be tailing me? -Until I find it. -Until you find what? What I'm looking for. If it's a fight, you're going to be disappointed. I'm going to catch you, I know it. Is that so? You're joking! Catch me how? You could have said: "Catch me for what", it sounds more innocent. If you like. Catch me for what? You're losing your cool, that's a good sign. If I catch you, I'll get a promotion. Then I'll be rich. Then it's not out of the question that I ask you to marry me. If you put me in prison, what would be the point? You can get married in prison, you know. In prison, married to a cop, I'll be a vision of health! -Sir. -I'm with her. -Do you have a card? -No, but I'm with her. -Ma'am, is he with you? -Him? Never seen him before in my life. -If you'll excuse me, sir. -Come on, now! Really? And in Paris… Champagne, ma'am? Go on, just a little glass, Mrs. Duvernet. A little glass. Yes. There you go. Hélène, are you alright? Hold this for me. -Thank you. -Ma'am. Stop! Police. Get out of here! What? So are you still seeing that big bonehead Marc? -Is this a dream? -No, want me to pinch you? -Super cops aren't easy to shake off. -How did you do that? Don't you worry about that, I just did. Are you still seeing that bonehead? Honestly, do you think he's the right guy for you? This is ridiculous! I'll do as I please! OK, I just think he has a stick up his ass. He's on his way down, you can say that to his face. Don't think I won't. I'm not scared of a guy who comes running when you toot the horn. There he is! Ah, what a pretty boy! -A pretty boy! -Hélène, what's going on? This asshole won't leave me alone. What's this about? Alright, little buddy, As we say, I'm the one who asks the questions. -I'm not your little buddy. -Yes, you're my little buddy! Come on, Marc. Let's go. Where do you think you're going? That's enough, lieutenant. Leave me alone. Marc, punch him. That's a great idea. Come on, little buddy. Let's go! -You're crazy! -Yeah, I'm crazy. Are you scared? -Are you scared stiff? -Yeah, you've got a gun! Asshole! Look at that! Twerp. Chicken! Oh, the bastards, my clothes! Hello, Martine? Yes, it's me. Are you busy right now? I got off work, but I have a problem. Do you still have the key I gave you? Can you bring it with you? There was a fight. I'm fine, but my coat didn't make it. I'll tell you later. I brought your things. You're careless, you know! It had your keys, your ID… Anyone could let themselves in. Where should I put them? On the chair. What do we say? Yes, thank you. As you're always turning up at my place I thought it would be a good idea to come hang around at your place. Change things up a bit. You're right. It's much nicer to turn up at people's houses without warning. It's more… More personal. I'm not waking you up, am I? What do you want? Shh! Don't talk so loud, you'll wake up your wife. -She's not my wife, we're not married. -Your fiancée, then. That's no reason to wake her up. It's cosy here. -What's going on? -Nothing, go back to sleep. Good morning. Please excuse your friend. I asked him to speak quietly, but he lost his temper. You read a lot! What eclectic tastes. The Charterhouse of Parma, Mission for a Killer… Oh, look, Madame Bovary! I'd like to read it again. Can I borrow it? Yeah… Actually, we've never been introduced. Hélène Duvernet, international spy. Don't worry, I won't stay long. I hope you have that important dossier of mine! Don't touch that, it's personal, secret stuff! Put it down! Fine, I'll go. I see I've overstayed my welcome. Goodbye, lieutenant. Goodbye, Miss… -Ma'am. -Where are you going? Here and there, a spot of shopping. Nothing too incriminating. Wait, I'll come with you! Wait, who is she? I'll explain, it's a work thing. Hey! Wait for me! Lieutenant, what a surprise! May I point out that if you do wish to come, you're hardly dressed for the occasion. You didn't leave me a lot of time to get ready! -Where are we going, lieutenant? -Wherever you like, I'm following you. You're going to be disappointed. -What do you think? -It's a bit revealing! -You think so? -Yes! Alright, I'll take it. -Do you have ties? -Yes, certainly. May I have a look? -Where are we going now? -To the hairdresser! Why? Your hair looks fine. -Good morning, Jean-Louis. -Good morning, Mrs. Duvernet. -Do you have an appointment? -It's not for me, it's for him. -Me? -It's for the beard. He left home in a hurry and didn't have time to shave. Wait, no… Why don't we take a little off the back? Don't touch what's left. I like it a bit long at the back, it's more relaxed… That's it. Gently. Gently, please. I have skin allergies and it makes me go all red… Gently, please. I come out in dry patches. Where is she? Well done, Leroux! What, have you never shaved before? Who is it? Mrs. Duvernet. Oh, hello, Mrs. Duvernet. Have you finished it? Yes and I must say I'm quite happy with my work. -What do you think? -It's perfect. Maybe your client will like it more than the Modigliani underneath. If he's a man of taste, of course. If he likes, I can do a dozen of these for a good price. Listen, I'm in a big hurry. Can you go and see if there's anyone downstairs? Um, yeah. -Who am I looking for? -A dwarf in a red tie. -Um, no. Why? -No reason. Hello, Marc. I've got them. I talked to Richardson. He's waiting for us, we'll fly out tonight. Can I help you? Hello, ma'am. Lieutenant Pélissier. I don't know if you remember me. I came to your house with a colleague about the Golf. You're covering for him, right? What do you mean? That maniac you work with hasn't left me alone for four days. He's following you, right? I mean… He's following you everywhere. I don't understand. Who are you investigating? Me or your colleague? You! I mean, neither of you… Because we work together and he doesn't tell me anything… You know, he's very… mysterious. Tell me, your friend… He doesn't have any instructions to investigate me? Oh, I'm sure he does. I mean… Yes, affirmative. Alright, I get it. Tell him that if he doesn't stop this immediately I will report him to his superiors. -Goodbye, lieutenant. -Goodbye, ma'am. Just don't be too strict with him. It's true that sometimes, he loses… his sense of human… Anyway… OK, goodbye, ma'am. Well done. Now you've really messed up. I told you to be careful. Now we're in deep shit. -I'm not going to Geneva. -I know exactly what I have to do. They'll never know. I'll go to Switzerland to sell some modern paintings to a client. All completely legal. Now, if you want to bail, go ahead. Don't take that tone. I'm not bailing but we've got two cops on our ass. Yeah, I've got two cops on my ass. So, screw you, I'm going to Geneva. -Who do you take me for? -For no one, actually. What are you doing here? Scram! -So? -So what? Are you going to tell me now? Get lost or you'll mess everything up. Mess what up? You've gone cuckoo, buddy. I just saw your Mrs. Duvernet. -Where? -At the gallery. She knows you're not following orders, if I were you… There she is! Get down! Do you think she saw us? If she saw anyone, it's you. Bravo, great job. Stop this, Leroux. If you keep pestering her, she's going to report you. -How will that make us look? -I'm going to catch her first. Catch her for what, damn it? Smuggling paintings, contraband goods, I don't know! But I'm going to catch her, I know it! Alright, then. Write a report and we'll open an official case. We can assign it to someone else. You mean well, but leave me alone. Go play with the metro gypsies! -You really have… -No respect, I know! Leroux, if you mess up, don't say I didn't warn you. Hello! You don't look surprised to see me. Are you going on a trip? Is this a bad time? You're not going to answer? If you want to annoy me it won't work, I'm as cool as a cucumber. Or maybe we're like those old couples who don't need to talk anymore. Eh? Is that it? You have noticed I'm here, right? -Yes. -Hello, taxi service? I would like a cab for 7, Rond-Point Du Château. So it's just me who you won't talk to? I thought it was medical, you scared me, because sometimes people catch things and they can't talk. But you were talking just there. Where are you going? Five minutes? Thanks. Alright, don't mind me, just pretend I'm not here, just ignore me. I'll take a seat and then I'll get on with my investigation… Now, don't get upset! Listen here… There's no need for that! You know what laying hands on a police officer will cost you? A lot! Especially when he's smaller than you! You're out of your mind! If you're having a fit of nerves you should calm down! Now, hold on. You can act all proud, you're not getting rid of me that easily! It might surprise you, but I can be very insistent! So, watch out. Orly please, driver. Don't push my buttons so much. You can stay here, sir. Parking's not allowed. I'm with you guys, pal, it's OK. -So, you're going to Geneva? -Yes. The plane is full, there's no point. Shall I bring you back some cigars? Seriously, what are you going to do in Switzerland? Meet with a chocolate smuggler. My plane is in 15 minutes. I will be in Geneva in two hours. By car, it'll take you about eight hours. And that's going fast. Passengers for Geneva, flight 348… That's my plane. I'm off. You can't imagine how much I'm going to enjoy this two-day holiday. Are you seeing a client or going on holiday? Oh, no. I'll be on holiday from you, lieutenant. And that will be just marvellous. I have to go. Goodbye. You think that's a nice thing to say? Passengers for Geneva, flight 348 will be boarding immediately at gate 35. CUSTOMS Good evening, ma'am. Anything to declare? No, personal belongings and two modern paintings. Here are the clearance papers. -Alright, you can go. -Thank you. Hello, the name's Mrs. Duvernet, I booked a room. Yes, that's right. CUSTOMS Good evening, sir. Your ID, please. -Do you have any goods to declare? -No, nothing. Can you open the trunk, please? Yes. There you go. You don't have any luggage? No, I left in somewhat of a hurry. I still have some pajamas at my friends' place in Geneva. Are you spending a long time in Switzerland? No, two or three days. -Reason for travel? -Yes. -Reason for travel? -Tourism. Do you know the address of your friends in Switzerland? I know how to get there but I couldn't tell you off the top of my head. Just a moment, please. Listen, I'm a French policeman, I'm going on holiday, so… Is that so? Well, I'm a Swiss customs officer and I'm doing my job. Hello, reception? Yes. Could you wake me up tomorrow morning at ten o'clock? Yes. Goodnight. No, not the seats! You've already done them twice. There. So, they go together like that: the woman with the clasped hands is under this one. This portrait is under this one. Would you like me to mark them? No, there's no need, I'll remember. I'll see my client in Zurich tomorrow. He will be delighted. OK. While we're here, I'd like for us to look at all the possible dates for the exhibition I want to hold at your gallery. Yes, me too. That's right, yes. Did you have a pleasant journey, Lieutenant Leroux? Tell me, Mrs. Duvernet, which paintings did you just sell to that man? These? Or these? What do you mean, lieutenant? What do I mean? You're good. You know very well what I mean. And now you're giving me the Little Miss Innocent act? You've got some nerve. This disguised painting trick is a joke! We shouldn't discuss that here. How silly of me! We shouldn't discuss that here! Otherwise, everyone will know that Mrs. Duvernet, one of their best customers, is a painting smuggler! Imagine the scandal! You're in a real pickle now, huh? You're out of ideas! All you can say is: "Be quiet, I'm begging you!" It's shameful. You should be ashamed! You've taken me for a fool since the beginning. "That dumb-ass cop is no threat. I'm too rich and too beautiful to have any trouble!" Yeah, right! I don't sleep, I don't eat, I drive for nine hours in the middle of the night. I look for you in every luxury hotel in Geneva. I catch you right as you're selling the stolen paintings and you don't even flinch! As if you had nothing to fear! Who do you take me for, Mrs. Duvernet? You think I'm just a little shit! Just a little shit! Oh, my god. Is the room spinning? Calm down. Don't take it like that! Leave me alone. Whoah… Oh my god, I'm dizzy. I have to lie down for a moment, I'm all dizzy. Get out of my room, visiting hours are over. The nurse is going to tell me off again… I just need to sleep for five minutes, I'll turn off the light because I don't sleep well with the light on. Lieutenant! Wake up! Stop that! What are you doing? Here. What's the story with Mrs. Duvernet? -Eh? Mrs. what? -Duvernet. Mrs. Duvernet! There is none, I dropped it because… I dropped it. So you've dropped it… for good. Ah, yeah. No, I would tell you. Just as well, because we nearly ended up in traffic control. I know. Oh, man. No, I've dropped it. -That's a nice tie. -You think so? Where did you get it? I've always had it. -I've never seen it. -Really? Well… No, it's nice. You're back late, lieutenant. What are you doing here? What do you want? Can we have a truce? We should talk, don't you think? -I'm all ears. -No, not here. Can we go upstairs? We can't do that, my fiancée’s there. My place, then. I'll make you a drink. Alright… -Is that you, Hélène? -Oh, crap. It's Marc. I see… -I'll leave you with your pretty boy. -No, wait here. I'll get rid of him. -What are you doing? -I'm having a bath. -You're not going to say hello? -No. What's wrong? What's going on? What's wrong is that you're never here when I need you and you show up when I don't want to see you. -What did I do? -Nothing. Leroux is downstairs. Now's the time for you to really start getting worried. -Eh? -There's something I didn't tell you. He came to Geneva. He knows everything. Shit, you're such an idiot! I told you not to go! Whatever, it's like I told you. It's your gallery, your money, it's all in your name, I had no idea, so sort out your own shit. You're a real slimebag. And you'll make a lovely jailbird. I'm going home. Watch out! Marc! -Lieutenant! Come quickly! -I'm right here. -It's terrible! -What happened? Marc was in the bath with a hair dryer, we had a fight and the hair dryer fell in the water. I think he's dead. -The hair dryer's dead? -No, Marc. I think he's dead. Shit. Alright, wait there, I'll go check. Mr. Marc? Are you OK? Oh, shit! -So? -He's completely dead. Bravo, you really weren't messing around. Don't be ridiculous, it was an accident! Good luck explaining that to the cops. You don't see many morons bathing with hair dryers nowadays. -Where are you going? -I'm phoning the police. -That's not a good idea. -Hello, police? What's wrong? -The police are right here! -I know. The police have been right here for two weeks! In the morning, in the evening, when I go to bed, when I take a bath… You really are a super cop. Not only am I going to prison, but on top of that, Marc's dead. I hope the police are happy, they've done a great job! It was just an accident. You can count on me, I was there. Count on you for what? Changing the fuses? Don't cry. I'll take care of it. I don't know how, but I'll take care of it. Do you have the keys to Marc's place? Yes, why? If someone's going to find a body in a bathtub, it'd better be his bathtub. Jesus! You've got to be stupid to weigh this much! Take the feet. Can you help me? The feet, there. Go on, put the feet in first. Lift. I can't see, lift! Go on, lift! You did it! Come back out, now. Push. There. It's OK, I've got it. Get in, I'm coming. -It's OK, the coast is clear. -This is crazy. -Let's call the police. -Don't start that again! Come on, it's not the time to freak out. See you soon. Next weekend! You promise? -Bye, see you soon. -Thank you, bye. With Marie-Christine, I doubt he'll be able to help him. She doesn't seem to enjoy it. Good evening. It's not so warm for this time of year… It suddenly… got a bit chilly. That's what I was saying to my wife. We were out walking and… -Right, dear? -Yes. It's not very warm. Well, we'll just… Excuse us. Well, goodbye, now. -Have a nice evening. -Goodbye. See? If you keep your cool, you can do anything. I'm warning you, try something like that again and I'll scream! That's a great idea, that solve all your problems. Oh no, shit! This can't be happening. What's wrong? Now, that's a real problem. It'll be hard to make them believe he electrocuted himself in a bathtub full of rubble. You could have thought of this before. What do we do now? What do you mean, "we"? It was you who had the bright idea of bringing Marc here. I should never have listened to you. Alright, let's take him back to mine and call the police. If you think it's best, that's your call but I'm warning you, they'll give you hell. -Do you have a better idea? -Not right now. With a bit of luck, they'll put someone who isn't you on the case. We called the cops straight away, it was an accident! -Now we're screwed. -Excuse me, you mean you're screwed. With your whack job games we keep getting ourselves in trouble! And you want none of the blame! You disgust me. You could have known that that twerp was redoing his bathroom! It's not the kind of thing I pay attention to, funnily enough! That's a shame, because you wouldn't be in this position. Can you give it a rest? Us! You! We are in deep shit because of you! They'll have a hard time figuring out how your friend went for a post mortem stroll. Anyway, that's your problem, not mine. I don't like rubbing my nose in other people's business. Go! Shit! Hit the gas! Drive past the house! -What's the matter? -Go, Pélissier is there! What the hell is he doing there? How would I know? He's suspicious. He must have clocked on to something. -Ouch! -What do we do now? -You don't have an idea? -Are you taking the piss? Don't freak out, there must be a solution! The solution was to leave him in my bath. But you're too big a whack job to see that. Where are you going? -I'm going home! -What? That's twice you've called me a whack job! I was happy to help you, but if you're going to insult me, I'm out. Bye! And can I just say that this has been an enormous hassle for me. You obviously don't care. Hey, gently! You're hurting me, stop! You're hurting me! I'm listening. Well… It's no use us losing our temper like that! Let's… -Let's throw him in the Seine! -What? Weighed down, so he doesn't float back up. That's what we'll do. Let's go, quickly, let's go! You're mad, we're not doing that. -Good evening, officer. -Good evening. What are you doing here? You know it's illegal to park on a bridge? Yes, but my fiancée… She's a romantic, she loves looking out onto the river at night. You must admit, it's beautiful here. Yeah. Alright, move it along. But next time you pull over for some hanky-panky, try and find a quieter spot. Anyway, we were just about to… -On you go. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. I should never have put up a fight. -Where are we going now? -Don't worry. We'll find a quieter bridge. Are you sure he's heavy enough? With 12 golf clubs and a jack, he'd have to be hollow to float! Alright? Let's do this! Don't get soft, now. Let's throw him. One… Two… Three! Shit, my jacket! -We're done for! -No, sorry. Correction, you're done for. It's your sheet, your lover! It won't take them long to connect the dots. You old bastard! Stop it! You have to run, they're going to find the body! Don't waste time hitting me! Wait! I'll help you pack! I'm not going to leave you hanging! There you go, you're safe. In an hour, you'll be flying to the land of sun and samba. -In the end, you're quite lucky. -I guess so. Thank you for everything. Let me know your address and I'll keep you in the loop. Of course! Well. Here we are. This is where we part ways. -Goodbye, lieutenant. -Goodbye, ma'am. Something good has come out of this. In a few minutes, you'll be out of my hair for good. That's not very nice. I was hoping to visit you on my holidays. I'll go somewhere else. There is just one thing I'd like to know. Why did you follow me like that? You must have suspected something about me from the beginning, or did you just latch onto me like that, randomly, without knowing where it would lead? I don't know, it was just like that. Just like that. You are a beautiful woman, Mrs. Duvernet. Goodbye. Did you fall out of a plane? -Excuse me? -Or you got dressed at the flea market? What do you care, are you the police? Shit! Don't get soft, now. Let's throw him. Shit, my jacket! Are you going to stay in Rio or travel around the region? Eh?
