Doesn't work for you? Can't believe you taught him that. [Laughs] I didn't. He did it on his own. Charlie, did you brush your teeth? - Yes. - Charlie. I brushed them. Let me see. Look at this, Con.

Shit. So buy some. Too late, Con. Too late. Lift the seat, honey. Don't forget to put it down. When you finish. Do you really need all that stuff? Mom, no one wears these dorky hats. Well, you do, and you're not a dork. How do I look? Very handsome. Love you. Ok. Come on, let's go. [Wind Gusts] Whoa.Jesus. Come on. Whoa. Maybe you shouldn't go in today. I promised I'd do that stuff for the auction, and someone's got a birthday coming up. Latrell Sprewell jersey, Mom. Don't forget. He's on the Yankees, right? Charlie: mom. You're driving me bonkers. You're driving him bonkers. Jesus. It's a holiday there. Second man on TV: Well, I'll just keep talking. No, no, that's ok. But in order to pick up... whoa! Aah! Taxi! Shit! Taxi! Taxi. Taxi!

It's this horrible wind. Yeah. You shot down there like a bullet. Ooh. If you flapped your arms, you'd be home by now. I'll remember that next time. That's not good. I know. Listen, that's me up there, the flower pot. I get you a band-aid, ok? Hold on to something. Don't blow away. Or... you can come on up and clean it off, no? Man: Come on. I'm not an ax murderer.

Go ahead. There's a medicine cabinet. You can sneak a peak at my prescriptions. [Chuckles] [Gasps] [Groans] Hello. I made you some tea. Thank you. Do you box? I used to when I was young. Hmm. This is an amazing place. Uh-huh. Yeah, but it's not mine. No? The owner is a friend, a sculptor, and he's living in Paris, so that's cool. We can stay here, me and my books. Hmm. Um, I--can I use your phone? I have to call home. Oh, sure, sure. There's a phone just behind you. Thank you. Gloria? Hi, it's me. Good, good. How's Charlie? Hi, honey. How was your day at school? Yeah? What was the best part? [Laughs] Guess what. Can you believe that mommy missed her train? Um... ice. Uh, about an hour. You should start your homework. No. I promise to tell you all about it when I see you. [Kisses] I love you. Bye. That was my son Charlie. He's 8. He'll be 9 next week. I'm Paul Martel. I'll be 28 in July. I'm Constance, and I'm late. I have to go. Before you go, take your book, no? Oh, no, I--I couldn't. I don't... sure, you can. A souvenir. Go down there. You know, like before. Ok. Keep going. Stop. Now right. No. Right. Ok, now the second shelf from the top. Take the fourth one from the left. [Clears Throat] Got it? Think so. Open to page 23. '' Drink wine. This is life eternal. ''This, all that youth will give to you. ''It is the season for wine, roses, and drunken friends. '' Be happy for this moment. This moment...'' Both: is your life. I have to go. Thank you. Can you find your way out? I hope so. That's my bedroom. It was nice meeting you, Constance. Hey, come back if you need more books or medical attention. [Door Closes] Ooh! Oh! TV: A perfect 1 0 there. Oh, my! Did you see that? - Hey, Glo. - Hey. That wouldn't be the TV on, would it? I was just turning it off. Sure you were. [Laughs] [Sighs] The wind knocked me down today, Glo. Oh, yeah? You all right? Do you need anything? Whoa. Gross. Were you in a fight? No,just fell over. Does it hurt? A little bit. Cool. Where are you going? To get the camera. - Try this. - Thank you. What do you need a camera for? It's for school. We're doing blood and stuff. Ok, now look like it really hurts. - Ready? - Yep. Ow! [Laughing] This'll be great. The wind blew her down. She bled and everything. Everybody's hats blew off. Look who's the world photographer. You ok? Yeah. It took me down like an old lady. Honey. It's humiliating. Dad, look at the pictures. At least we got the evidence. Anyone we can sue? - Whoa! - No. There was this nice guy who helped me. It was like this, Dad. It was a twister. Whoa. Whoa. Dad, look. It was like this. - Wow. - This is a tornado. He lived around there. He got me some Band-Aids and put me in a taxi. Is he good-looking? I feel sick. Did you do your homework, Charlie? I can't. I don't know how to do it. Well, come on. I'll help you. You can help me with mine. Did you get his name? This guy? You can send him a bottle a wine. Cheap wine. Edward: Con, stand there a second. Con, wait a minute. Just stay there a second. I'm just trying to figure out how to do the, um... the thing I can't figure out is the, um... zoom thing here. There it is. Ok, hold on. Stay there. The zooming thingie. Zooming in. Wait a minute. Stay there. No, come on. I'm just trying to figure this thing out. I want to see if it focuses. [Laughs] Hold on. Come here. Cool. Very cool. So beautiful. If you only knew. Look at you. God, what a beauty. Something the matter? Nothing. Nothing at all. Good. Come here. This is really good. No, it isn't. Go away. Come here. This is major. I think it really is zooming in. I found the zoom. Found it. Charlie: Dad! [Sighs] - Mom! - Shit. [Laughs] Charlie: I can't sleep. That camera. Jesus. I'll be back. I'll be back. Don't fall asleep. It works. Mom, are you nuts? You forgot my lunch. I did not. It's by the door. Come with me. What are you chew-- what are you chewing? Nothing. Spit that out. What is that? Oh, that's lovely. - Mom? - Yes? I don't want to be a dumb bunny. Honey, it's a play. There's lots of other bunnies. It would be cool to be a bunny. You're bonkers, Mom. That's what you tell me. Love you. Love you, too. What's that? Oh. Thank you. [Laughs] [Charlie Humming] Bye. Shit. [Paul's Phone Rings On Line] - [Ring] - [Clears Throat] - [Ring] - [Clears Throat] Machine: Hi, this is Paul Martel. Leave a message after the beep. Thanks. [Beep] Paul: Hello? Hello? Hello? - Hello. - Hello. You're--you're there. This is Connie Sumner, the one from the really windy day. Oh, that one. How's the knee? Did you ice it? Yes, I iced it and I elevated it, and you name it, I did it, and it's much better. And I--I just wanted to call and I wanted to thank you and, um, I wanted to ask for your address because I wanted to send you a bottle of-- - Where are you? - What? I said where are you? I'm in Grand Central. It's really hard to hear you. Come and see me. What? Yeah, take a break. I'll make you some coffee. Coffee? Um... uh, ok. Ok. See you. Bye. Fuck. Ah, no permanent damage, I see. [Clears Throat] We take Medicaid, Blue Cross. I'm uninsured. No, I'm afraid we don't take charity cases here. It was a joke. Oh, look at this. Jack London. First edition of White Fang in the original dust jacket. And you know what? I got it for a buck-50. What's it worth? [Blows] About 4,000 times more. Those are in French. I took it in school. Ah. Uh... [Speaking French] Do I want to take off something? Um, your coat. Would you like to take off your coat? Yes, my coat. Heh. Thank you. But I can't stay very long. I have some errands I have to run. I'll get the coffee. Ok. Shit. Ow. It's in Braille. Braille. No, no. Braille. He was French. Close your eyes. What? Close your eyes. '' My mother makes me chicken.'' '' Her chicken makes me cough.'' ''I wish that when she made it, she took the feathers off.'' It doesn't say that. [Laughs] I had better go. Huh? I'd better go. Uh, take care. Don't fall. Thanks for the coffee. [Opens Door] You didn't drink it. [Closes Door] Hi. Lindsay, hi. Ah, Connie. Let me buzz him. Thanks. Hey, what a surprise. Look at you. Hi, Bill. Hi, Connie. Am I interrupting? No, no. I was just leaving. All right, I'll, uh, I'll get you the budget for those trucks later. Edward: All right. Thanks. Would you like a coffee? No, thank you. Mmm. Ah, that's nice. Mmm. Mmm. You know, I didn't know you were coming in today. I could've given you a ride. You're freezing. What is that? Well, I was around the corner, and I brought you a present. Wow. What's the occasion? Nothing. I don't know. It's a medium, but they said it runs large. Look at that. You don't have to try it on. I'm the boss. I can do whatever I want. What do you think? [Telephone Rings] Hold on just a second. [Ring] Yeah? Oh, all right, but hold the other calls. You're busy. I'll go. Sit down. Sit down. I'll go. No. Sit. Sit. Sit. Hello, Henry. Yeah, so what is this suspension problem? No, I never received it. Well, all right. Well, get it to me. Henry, this--no, it's not good enough. I'm sitting here with 200 trucks that I can't use. All right. Well, set up a meeting. Yeah, and I want Frank Burnbaum there. 'Cause I don't feel good about this guy. When I tell someone to do something, I want it done. I'm sure you will. Anyway... so, what else you up to? Auction. Yeah? Who'd you hit on? The usual suspects. Who? Bob Gaylord. Bob? You get a pledge out of Bob, they should send you to the middle east. So, tell me... what? What do you think? It's a keeper. Jeez. Hello. Hello. [Ai Du playing] Here I am again. I brought muffins. [Speaking French] What is this music? You like it? Yes. Do you want to dance? Now? Yeah. Ok. I have to warn you, I tend to lead. Of course. You are American. You've done this before. Uh, what? How many girlfriends have you had? Um...2. Really? Would I lie to you? I don't know, would you? Your eyes are amazing, you know that? You should never shut them. Not even at night. You should learn to sleep with your eyes open. I'll work on that. Will you? [CD Skips] Hang on. I think this is a mistake. There's no such thing as a mistake. There's what you do and what you don't do. I can't do this. I forgot my coat. [Whispering] I can't. I can't. What? What? What's wrong? I can't. I don't know how to do this. - This is wrong. - Hit me. I don't want to. Hit me. - Aah! - Hit me. Oh! Say, Ed. Hey, Bob. Haven't seen you in a while. No. No. I've been working late this week. How's the boy? He's a pistol of a kid. He's gonna have a birthday. - Really? How old? - 9. So, uh, any major armed robberies? [Chuckles] No. No, not this week. Speaking of armed robberies, you better watch out for Connie. She's gonna get you to sign over your mortgage. What do you mean? Did she try to hit on you for some money? No. I thought she talked to you about this, uh, school auction, with... not me. But I've been out of town. Maybe she talked to Maggie about it. Yeah. Yeah, I guess I got it wrong. Anyway, we owe you a dinner. Yeah. He's out. Mmm. Can I get you anything? No. No, I'm fine. Thanks. Tough day? Mmm, not really. How about you? How was your day? It was good. You know, the usual stuff. Sure you don't want anything? No. Con? Yeah? Do you love me? Of course I love you. What a silly question. [Sighs] I guess... I'm just feeling silly. I'll be up in a minute. Ok. Sorry. What are we doing here? Having lunch. I shouldn't be doing this. What, you shouldn't be having lunch? Not with you. I think we should leave. Listen... see those guys over there paying the check? Yes. Ok, if the guy on the right pays, we'll leave right now. If the guy on the left pays, we stay. And I kiss you. No. No. No. No. No. Ah. Ah. Hey, you're kidding me, man. [Sighs] I win. No. - Ready? - No. [Laughs] Don't do it. Don't. [Ai Du plays] Room for 2? Of course. Nice music. What is it? It's, um... African, I think. I like it. Here. Let's go to bed. Come on. Stay here with me. I'm cold. - Stay here. - I'm cold. Stay here with me. I'm cold. Come on, let's go. How about lunch today? You free? I have all this fund-raiser stuff. Auction things to pick up. We can do an early one if you want. How about 1 2:00? 1 2:00? Yeah. Will I be hungry at 1 2:00? We could go in together. I'll wait for you. I'm not gonna be ready to go for at least an hour. That's all right. I'll wait. Oh, shit. What? I just remembered... I have a facial at 1 2:30 at Georgiana's today. Oh, well. You gotta stay beautiful, right? Georgiana's, huh? Waste of money. Yeah, Manhattan. Uh, beauty salon called, uh, Georgina. Uh, yeah, right. Yes. Yes. Georgiana's. That's right. Thank you. Hello, I'm calling to confirm an appointment today, 1 2:30. Sumner. Connie Sumner. S-u-m-n-e-r. Could she...could she be down for another time? No, thank you. Connie? Connie? Connie? [Laughs] Tracy. Hi. I was gonna call you. That's what they all say when I call about bunny costumes. You know Sally from Planned Parenthood. Hi. It's been a while. Well, too long. Too long. You look amazing. So where you headed? Oh, I was just going to, um, go look at some window shades for the kitchen. Well, we're gonna go and have coffee. Why don't you join us? Oh, I'm gonna be late. For window shades? Come on. Ok. Ok. [Laughs] Hi, how are you? I'm just going to make a phone call. - Sure. - [Coughs] Mmm. She could have used my cell phone. Hi, it's me. You're not gonna believe this. I'm at the cafe around the corner. Why do you have to introduce me as Sally from Planned Parenthood? [Laughs] What do you mean? Well, it makes it sound like I'm in New York handing out condoms. I'm stuck here. Will you wait for me? Wait for me. With the redhead. Just can't take it. She has it the next morning-- Had to call Gloria, remind her to pick up the dry cleaning when she gets Charlie. Never a dull moment. Charlie is so adorable. Thank you. [Speaking French] [Speaking French] I can't eat. I'll have a coffee. Well, I guess I'll have coffee, too. Excuse me again. Ladies room. God, she looks good. Mm-hmm. Do you think she's had work? Why would she have work? She still looks gorgeous. That's when they're having it now. Early, before it all goes to shit. I have friends out there. You take me to the best places. Wait. Let me... she's not like that. She's really nice. Of course she is. That makes it worse. She is nice, and she's sweet, and her ass is in exactly the same place it was when she was in college. Are you taking tennis? Oh, I wouldn't call what I do taking tennis. [Laughs] There you are. I was beginning to worry. No, it's fine. I'm fine. We thought you were abducted by that heartthrob. What heartthrob? You didn't see him at the counter? He was gorgeous. I miss everything. Your button's undone. Oh, thank you. That's him. I guess I could see the appeal. Well, if he looked at me twice, I would be on my back in a second. Oh, you would not. Oh, I would so. Why not? Well, a couple of reasons. Adam for one, your kids for another. Well, you know, Tracy, they wouldn't have to know about it. It could be just something that I did for myself. You know, to broaden my horizons. It'd be like taking a pottery class. Having an affair is nothing like taking a pottery class. Could be. No. It would start out like that, and then, um, something would happen. Someone, uh, finds out, or someone falls in love, and it ends disastrously. They always end disastrously. Tracy. No. When? It was a long time ago, and it's the one thing in my life I would undo if I could. [Clears Throat] Did you just fuck me across the street? Mm-hmm, I did. You know, we could end this now, and no one would get hurt. Yeah? I think if we ended this now, I'd get hurt. So, no matter what, someone get's hurt? Maybe not. Maybe we'll get tired of each other. God, I hope I get tired of you. You're in my mind. You're the only thing in my mind when I wake up every morning. You're in my brain before I even open my eyes. What do you think of? It depends. If it's a day when I don't know if I'm going to get to see you, I'm anxious, thinking of excuses to come into the city and see you. And the days you know we meet? On those days... I'm...calm and hating myself. Oh, God. This is what we have over here. And...I'll have it ready for you this afternoon. That happens all the time... Ed, what's up? It sounded important. I've heard you're talking with Dunbar and Brinks, a few other companies. Oh, yeah? Where'd you hear that? Well, look, I mean, I suppose they could be, uh, wooing me, if that's what you mean. Apparently a lot of people are wooing you these days. Now, who's wooing who? Whoa. Whoa. Wait. What are you talking about? So I talked to some people. So what? This is about loyalty, Bill. I'm letting you go. You'll have my recommendation if you need it. I have a family, Ed. You had a family here. Wait. Wait a minute. You're telling me about family? Well, you don't know the first goddamn thing about it. Why don't you take a look at your own fucking family, Ed? Take a goddamn look at that. - Hi, Ed. - Frank. Thanks for coming on such short notice. This is personal. It's not business... so you think about it. I don't know if you're gonna want to get involved with this, but I need someone I can trust. I want you to follow somebody. I-- I want you to follow my wife. It's burning, Mom. What? It's burning. The chicken. Oh, shit! [Quietly] Shit. [Gasps] It's boiling, Mom. It's boiling! Thank you. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Watch it. Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry. It's fine. I have to go to Chicago tomorrow. For how long? Not long. Probably just a night. What time's your flight? 8:00. A.M.? Diane Dryer's son is marrying Amy Lynne's daughter. I'm never getting married. Why not? I hate girls. Well, you might change your mind. That happens sometimes. I won't. What? I fired Bill Stone today. So that's what's bothering you. Nothing's bothering me. Why did you fire him? He's not accountable. What's accountable? Is it, like, people who eat people? No, no... that's a cannibal. Anyway, I can't trust him anymore. So if you run into Dolly, you'll know. [Door Closes] Well, how are you gonna clean up the area so pedestrians can get through? Oh. What?! I can't believe you! What are you doing? [Camera Shutter Clicks] [Quietly] Shit! Shit! Come on! I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. That's all right. Honey, are you ok? You must have been so worried, huh? Stop, Mom. This isn't fair. Ok. [Dialing Telephone] [Ringing] Answering machine: hi, this is Paul Martel. Leave a message after the beep. Thanks. Mom? Honey... you're supposed to be in bed. You're crying, Mom. Oh, honey... mommy's just a little sad, that's all. Come on, I'll take you to bed. [Softly] Let's get you into bed. Don't be sad, Mom. Dad will be home tomorrow. His name is Paul Martel. He lives at 433 Mercer Street, apartment 3. She sees him during the day. Usually goes around lunchtime. Stays about 2 hours, maybe 3. They go to the movies? They did that day. Otherwise, they're in his apartment. [Horns Honk] [Horns Honk] Pick up. Hey. Hey, lady! Forgot your keys. [Playful Whispers] [Whispering] Oh, hey. - Whoa! - Wait! - Aah. Aah! - Whoa, whoa. Who is she?! Who is she?! No! Calm down! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why are you doing this? How many are there? 5? 1 0? God, what am I? The Monday one. What, did I get my day wrong? She's just a friend, ok? Just a friend. You're a fuckin' liar. Me? I'm the liar? I can't do this anymore. Fine. Go back to your suburban carpool. Your tennis dress on your-- What are you doing? What are you doing? Fuck you! That'll make you happy. Fuck you! No. No, I can't. Paul, it's over. I can't. I hate you. I hate you. I know. Stop it. I can't. You gonna fuck me? - Huh? - You want it? Yeah, I want you to. Say it. I want you to fuck me. I want you to fuck me. [Car Horn Honks] [Door Opens] Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, indeed. Yes? You're Paul Martel? Yes. How old are you? Who are you? Edward Sumner. Connie's husband. May I... may I come in? Yeah. Sure. Would you like a drink? Yeah. Why not? I have scotch, vodka...prune juice. Uh, vodka. Is it cold? Yeah. I keep it in the freezer. So do I. At home. So tell me, how did you... meet my wife? By accident. On the street. There was a wind storm, she hooked her knee-- Oh...you're him. She told you about that? Yes. How's it going? Fine. Fine. I mean, ok. This is where you meet? Yes. She likes it? Well, I guess. She never complained. Do you stay in all the time, or do you go out, too? It depends. Sometimes, yes, we go out. She likes that? She... likes this neighborhood? Oh, yeah. More exciting than the suburbs, I guess. Do you know that we have been married 1 1 years? We have a son. Yeah, she told me. More? Yes, please. He's the reason that we left the city. Connie thought it would be better for him. Oh. She told me it was your idea. You...talk about me? Lot of books. Yeah. Lot of buying and selling. [My Kind Of Town plays] [Chuckles] Didn't know it did that. [My Kind Of Town plays] Where did you get this? It was a gift. From her. [Sighs] Why would she do that? I don't know. Maybe--maybe she just wanted to buy me something. [Sighs] She didn't buy this for you. I gave it to her. [Sighs] [Sniffles] I gave it to her. What? [Crying] I gave it to her. I gave--I'm s-- [Gasps] I'm feeling sick. I can't... you want some water? I'm feeling sick. I'm... I don't... I'm--I'm not well. I'm not feeling well. [Grunts] I'm not... I'm not feeling... aah! Unh! Unh! God! Aah! [Telephone Rings] Answering machine: hi, this is Paul Martel. Leave a message after the beep. Thanks. - [Beep] - Connie: Hi, it's me. Listen... I don't like saying this to your machine, but... I have to end this. [Sobbing] I just-- I can't do it anymore. I can't live like this. I'm so tired of lying and hurting my family. I'm sorry. Um, I hope--I don't know what I hope. I'm--I'm sorry. [Phone Disconnects] Aah. Unh. [Machine Beeps] Messages erased. [Piano Plays] Does that pinch?

He's been reported missing by his family. His wife doesn't know where he is. I didn't know he was married. Separated. When did you see him last? Phew. Wow. I don't know. It's hard to say. Um... he's a book dealer. I... I barely know him at all. I was going to buy some books from him. And did you? No, not yet. [Sighs] Has something happened to him? I mean, do you think he's all right? It's hard to say at this point. We're workin' on it. Anyway, thanks, uh, thanks for your time. Connie: Thank you. I like these snow glass things. My boy has some of these. If you hear from Mr. Martel, let us know. Certainly. Dad, the cops came to our house today. Cops? What did they want? Someone's missing, and they have to check everyone, you know. Who was it? Honey, sit up straight. Who was it? I don't think you know him. He's, uh, he sells books. Oh. I forget where I met him. Was it a bad guy, Mom? So what did they, uh, why did they wanna talk to you? I guess he had my name and number. Why--why would he have your number? I think I bought a book from him. Be careful. Be careful. Hey, Charlie. Oh, wait a second. Hi, darlin'. Oh, I wish you lived closer. Lord, bless this food to our use and us to thy service... and help us to be ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen. All: Amen. Man: Edward. All: All right! [Applause] I have a--I have a story you don't know about Edward. He was at the club... [Laughs] Hello, Mrs. Sumner. Sorry to bother you on the weekend. I'm, uh, detective Dean. Oh. This is detective Mirojnick, NYPD. Ok. We were hoping to talk to you for a few minutes. Uh, sure. Charlie, we're gonna go up on the porch for a minute. Can I come? No, sweetheart. You stay out here. Play with Poppy. We'll be right back. I don't know if your wife mentioned we was here about a week and a half ago about Paul Martel. Yeah, that was the-- the man who was missing. Well, he's not missing anymore. His body was discovered last weekend. God, that's-- that's terrible. Oh, my God. Do you recall where you met Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner? I told you. Uh, no, ma'am, you didn't. I'm sorry. Um, I can't remember. A fund-raiser, I think. Can you be more specific? Juilliard. Juilliard. The music school. Yes, I know whatJuilliard is. Oh, of course you do. I'm sorry. Were you there, too, sir? Yes, yes, I think I was. Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel. No, no, not that I remember. Maybe you'd recognize him. No, no. I never met him before. Is that him? Yes, yes. You ever been to his apartment? No. No, I--I-- I hardly knew him. I didn't even know why he had my phone number. Maybe he liked you. Look, I think that's enough. So you've never been to his apartment. Well, how 'bout, uh, the neighborhood. Did you hang out down there? No. No, not often, or no, never. Never. I can't remember the last time I was in Soho. It was 4 weeks ago, actually. You got a parking ticket right in front of Martel's apartment 4 weeks ago. Oh, that. Right. I had coffee with friends at a little place. I forgot. It was Tracy and Sally. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah. Edward: Look... my wife has told you everything she knows. So have I. So... if you don't mind, we'd like to get back to our son. All right. Uh, why don't I give you my card? I have your card. Right. Enjoy your weekend. You, too. Sumner, please. Oh, my God. Hi, Connie. Hi, Tracy. I'm just picking up my silk suit for tonight. I was thinking of wearing the black. I'm gonna give up the good row. Let someone else be gorgeous for a change. Heh heh. So what should we bring aside from our sparkling personalities? Edward: How we doing? Fine. You need help? No. The white is not cold, so I'm gonna put it in the freezer. Just remind me it's in there, all right? Most people drink red anyway. Oh, I love these things. Is there anyplace you guys haven't been? Mmm, the Rosenthals got 7 95 for their place. In 2 days, they had 6 offers. Sealed bids. That's what everyone's doing now. What do you think this place is worth, Ed? Oh, I don't know. You sell your house, where do you go? Tracy: At those prices, Tahiti. Man: Bangkok. Connie, where's this one from? Fiji. Woman: oh, remember,Jeff, I asked you to take me to Fiji... Jeff: Mmm. And then you took me to Hawaii? We went fishing every single day... what happened, Edward? What did you do? Did you hurt him? Huh? Edward? Did you hurt him? You did, didn't you? Oh,Jesus, Edward. Talk to me. Tell me what you did. No, you tell me what you did. How you fucked him over and over and over. You lied to me... over and over and over. Edward, please. No, you don't talk to me now. I gave everything... for this family. Everything... and what did you do? You threw it all away like it was nothing. For what? To a fucking kid. You didn't think I'd know? I wouldn't feel it? I knew it from the very first day. Because I know you, Connie. I know you, and I fuckin' hate you! I didn't want to kill him. I wanted to kill you! Oh, my God. Edward. Oh, my God. Dear God. Mom, look what I did. That's ok. I'm sorry, Mom. It's an accident. Everybody has accidents. Why aren't you in bed, Mom? I don't know. Charlie, look at me. I want you to know that I love you more than anything in the world. And I want you to know that your daddy and me both will always, always love you. No matter what, hmm? - Ok? - Ok. Come on, sweetie. Let's go fix up your bed all nice and fresh, ok? All right. [Piano Plays] [Siren Approaches] [Siren Fades Away] [Winder Sticks] You can come on up and clean it off, no? Come on. I'm not an ax murderer. I promise. What are we gonna do? I'm so scared. I'll turn myself in. No. No. No, we can get through this. We'll take it one day at a time. No one will know. We'll know. Auctioneer: 31 , 3,500, 3,800, 4,000, 42, 45, 4,800... we could disappear. We could raise some money, sell everything, and just leave the country. Senorita. Mexico. Why not? We could get a little house on the beach, take a different name. People do it all the time. What do we tell Charlie? Connie: Tell him it's an adventure. We could fish all day. We could learn to play the guitar. And I would serenade you to sleep every night. We'd just live the rest of our lives on that beach... and then when we die, we could just push out to sea. What do you think? It sounds perfect.
