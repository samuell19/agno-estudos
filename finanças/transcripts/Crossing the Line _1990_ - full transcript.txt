[ENGINES REVVING] You got a little dirty there, Pancho! Great track, huh? What do you think? Yeah, it's a nice kiddie playground. Give me the flask. Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Listen, man, they race here!Yeah. You're always been a team player, man. What's wrong with that? It's safe. Give me a break! Look, try to keep up, all right, Pancho? Just get out of here, huh? Not so bad out there, is it, huh? I need a beer, man. You know...Look, we can sit around here and jaw-jack all day, but I'm thirsty, okay? Hey, I love you too. Look, man, wouldn't you rather be, with a beautiful woman, you know, a nice, soft, supple body, a beer in your hand than sitting in a play pen full of idiots. No![GIGGLES] I don't want my ass kicked around that factory tomorrow, man. It's a drag, but I got to go home. All right, man. I'll ride that far with you. I'm just jacking off around here anyway. You can win a race out there.What? You could win a race out there. [SIREN WAILING] [POP MUSIC PLAYING] RICKY: Ellie, give me a draft, please. Thanks. [PHONE RINGING] Yeah? Hello, Josh? Yeah. Who is this? KAGAN: Yes, Ray. Ray, this is always the same story. I know, Ray. There's always a reason. [PHONE RINGING] Hang on.RAY: Jack. Jack?Harold, tell me. I just got off the line with the union. They've given me a list of their demands. I hope you're sitting down, you're not going to like this. Kapinski's headed right this way. Might as well get it from him first and... And then I'll call you back and let you know the verdict, okay? Listen, Ray, uh, you listening? Yeah, I'm listening. Cancel the order. What do you mean, you're canceling the order? Why? Because I have enough problems of my own without having to do business with you. But, Jack, what about... Hey, let's sit down and negotiate like friends. Here are your reports, I don't want to sit down. My son's in the hospital. Zack?Josh. What happened?He was with your son and those damn motorcycles. He's in a coma.Really? Josh is in a hospital, dying because he followed your son. Come on. You know what I'm talking about. Ricky's out of control. Now he's killing people! What are you going to do about it? I'm not going to fight with you. Let me find out Ricky's side of the story, then we'll talk. Why don't you go home? Be with your son. Dad? Dad, what are you doing home so early? Ow! I told you repeatedly, very specifically, not to spend time, any time with the Kapinski's, particularly Josh!Okay, what are you talking about? I'm talking about trouble. I just checked with the hospital, he's in a coma. Wait, Dad, I didn't... I...Shut up, will you? I mean, he may not live and if he does, there may be permanent damage. I tried straightening out the mess that your mother made of your life. The mess my mother... Wait a minute, the mess you made, Dad! Look, Dad, I... Look, whatever happened, it wasn't my fault. That doesn't even matter anymore. Everybody thinks that it was your fault. You know what that does to me? You know what that means to my negotiating position with the union? Do you? Fuck your union, man! Fuck your goddamn company! You're not leaving this house.He killed my mother, now he's killing me! You're not going to see anybody.Fuck that! And you're not going to talk to anybody.Oh, yeah? You walk out that door, don't come back. Hey, give the boy a prize. You got it. [SIGHS][BIKE REVVING] NURSE: It's extremely serious.

Yeah, well, I'm not feeling so good, Zing. Yeah. In trouble again, huh? Things just keep piling up, you know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean. Anything I can do? Well, I could use a place to stay, you know, just for a couple of nights until I can find a place. You leaving home, huh? Yeah, it looks like it. Yeah. Well, a couple of nights, no more. You can sleep in the back, okay? Two nights? Yeah. Okay. I got no problem, I might not even need it. Yeah, well, in case you do need it, two nights, okay? Okay.Just remember, this is a restaurant, not a motel. [LAUGHING] Okay. The key?The key, yeah. God, Zing, you could at least wash the stuff before you burn it. Hey, hey, hey! You're taking chances with your life, muchacho! Okay, okay. No, hey, you're the best cook in the whole diner, man! I'm the only cook, smuck-o! [LAUGHS] Come on, good game, huh? Listen, I think she's ready to... Get laid.Who? Me!No, I mean who is she, man? Laura Lee! I need some condoms. So, go buy some, man. I can't.Why not? I'm embarrassed, okay? Could you get me some? [SIGHS] Oh, Jesus! You're not going to need this much money, all right? Do me a favor and finish the game. Freddie, will you buy me another milkshake, please? Oh! Nice going. I'm sorry, are... Are you okay? Do you work here? My father owns this place. Oh, geez, I didn't know Big Al had any children... I mean daughters. My parents were divorced when I was nine. I live in Chicago with my mother. I'm just here visiting. Megan! What are you doing here? Ah, just was looking for a place to dump my garbage and your shop was the first place I thought of. Well, you're not welcome here. Look, man, my bike needs a part.Look. I've had it with your arrogant bullshit! Your father... Leave my old man out of this! Your father should have broken your spine when you were born! Dad! Leave me alone!No, Dad, don't! Stop it, Dad! [SCREAMS] Oh, my God, Dad, are you okay? Dad? Call the cops. Oh, shit! Hey, Rick, come on! Your condoms, sir. WORKER 1: What are you doing, starting a collection, Freddie? WORKER 2: What else could he do with them? What the hell do you know? Hey, shut up, you guys. Give me a break, all right? You didn't have to do that, Rick. No, I suppose not, man. I'm sorry. Thanks, though.Hey, anything for a pal. Yeah, you're going to need all the pals you can get. Oh? What happened last night? What do you mean? I mean Josh is in a hospital in a coma.Yeah, I know. Were you with him? Yeah. Oh, shit. Zack's been motor-mouthing about you leaving his kid brother in the dirt. He blames the whole thing on you. Yeah, well, I didn't do anything, man. Yeah, well, Zack says...[DOOR OPENS] ZACK: Hey. Chicken shit.Hey, man. Come on, Zack, I know he's your brother. He's my friend, man, I... Look, don't you think I care what happens to him? I stopped by the hospital to see him this afternoon... Fuck you, man! You don't give a shit about anyone but Ricky Kagan, so don't try to kiss my ass because you know I'm going to kick yours. How can you say that to me, man? I was with him when he went down the wrong side of the road. Come on, man, none of us really knows what happened. Yeah? He does, and so do I. It wasn't as if Ricky... What are you doing? Get off me! I didn't do anything, Zack, goddamn it! No! I'm going to hold your head under the water till you go out. Ricky, you're going to know what death feels like. Get off of me, Zack! I didn't do anything, Zack! [GRUNTING] How does it feel, boy? Leave him! Don't you fuck with me. Now, get! What in the fuck is the matter with you? Now, get out of here! [SCREAMING] What's the matter with you, Pa? Whose side are you on?I'm on the right side, Son, and if you don't stop this shit, somebody's going to get killed! Josh is dying, damn it, it's his fault! I'm sorry, Son. Go on home, go on. Come on, go. Wait, wait, wait, Ricky, go home, get out of here, get, get out of here. The streets are mine.

Oh, Ricky, I forgot to tell you my Dad filed a complaint against you, assault, I think, for the damages and the bikes. Great. Why are you telling me this?I know. I don't know, uh...

How's it feel, Rick? Huh? Come on, Ricky! Huh, Ricky boy? Get up, you little shit! Huh? Ricky, Ricky, come on, Rick. How do you feel, son? Does it feel good? It feels great, doesn't it? [YELLING] MAN: Zack! Hey, Ricky, what's burning, boy? It's your bike. Do you like that, boy? Huh? Look at it. [SIRENS WAILING] Hey, Zack, it's the cops.Let's get out of here! Zack, come on, man! Let's get out of here, Zack! You like it? Oh, shit! Hold it right there, boys. Hey, mister! Hey! Hey! SHERIFF: Oh, good evening, Mr. Kagan. Call me Jack. What is my son charged with? Well, Al Murdoch has filed a complaint. Apparently there are a couple of bikes broken and there was some damage to the shop store window, maybe an injury, but you'd better speak with his attorney about that. Oh, by the way, your son was involved in a street brawl earlier tonight. Who with? Zack Kapinski. Okay, I'm bailing my son out. You can release him now. Can I get a little cooperation? If you look down there, right behind your feet, you'll see a dark green line on the floor. Now, you step back behind that line now, Mr. Kagan, or we're going to have a very serious problem here. Ah! [LAUGHS] That's better. Now, would you like to, uh, see Ricky? Not just yet. Your son needs more than your money, Mr. Kagan. I don't need your advice. I think you do. I think you fucking well do. I posted bail for you. Why? Because I'm your father. Thanks. Al do that to you? No. Zack? Look, I'm sorry I hit you, but I'm not responsible for your mother's death. I told you to leave Ricky alone. Now, you're starting to cost me. I'll pay for the bike and I'll pay for the bond, okay? It's not the money, Son. But yeah, you will pay for the bike and you will pay for the bond. Go on home, Son. Jack! Isn't this the pits? What do you want, Joe? What do I want? I want a condominium in Maui. What do I want? I'm not in the mood. You're not in the mood. Who in the hell do you think you are? This is getting pretty tired, Joe. Let's get a rest. Gentlemen, if you have a minute, I'd like to talk to both of you in my office. I think that'll have to wait. Look, if you don't give a damn about these boys, if you don't care about them, just let them go. But for God's sakes, if you do care about them, make them part of your own lives. For Christ sake's, Mel, you know what's been going on here? He's right, Joe. What about Josh? He did what he wanted to do, I mean, he's got a mind of his own. Joe, Sheriff, good night.Good night. Mel... How was it with you? How was what with me? Losing your son? I don't think it's any of your damn business. Avoid it if you can. [ECG BEEPING] Zing!Yeah? Hi. What happened to you? Oh, I ran into a little trouble. Seems like trouble has a habit of following you around.Yeah. Listen, I'm, I'm really sorry about yesterday, you know, with your Dad and the bike, and the window... Oh, it's okay. Your Dad came over this morning and fixed... He took care of it? Yeah, he did.Yeah, it figures. Hey, I'm sorry about my Dad too. He gets real hot-tempered.Yeah. Well... I'll see you around sometime.Wait a minute. You got time for a walk? I don't think so.Just five minutes? Okay.Okay, great. Hey, Zing, keep these hot for us, we'll be right back. So? So, when my Mom found out about the other women she moved out. She didn't put up a fight? I don't know. Maybe she did. You know, I don't remember my parents even fighting. All I do remember is one day she packed her things and we moved out. How did she die? A broken heart. But, medically, I mean, what happened? I... I don't think I ever really knew, you know. This woman came over from my father's office, took me to my father's house. You know, I say my mom a couple of times in the hospital and she looked okay, then she died. [SIGHS] I remember the funeral, that's all. What happened then? Boarding school.Boarding school? Yeah. [CHUCKLES] You know what's funny? I don't even remember starting boarding school. It's like this other part of my life, you know? It's like my life ended and there's this other part of my life, you know, the way things happen in a dream. You're here, you know, and... And you're not here, you're there. You know what I mean? Yeah. Anyway, I guess I must have seen my father all those years, but I don't remember him then. Not until I came back here to finish school. So, now you basically give the world the finger. Yeah, basically. And you think that's going to make everything okay? Look, I don't know what to think, you know, I... You want to know what I think? Sure. I think you're doing exactly what your father wants you to do. You're making yourself small. Why don't you do something for yourself? I mean, really for yourself. Like what? You can ride a bike as well as anyone.Yeah, probably better. So, why don't you do something with it?Like what? [SIGHS] How can somebody so good looking be so dumb? Why don't you go down to Sinclair's race track and try and join his team? You can probably beat everyone there. Look, you just don't walk up to a complete stranger and ask him for a job. Why not? I don't know, I guess because I never thought of myself that way. What way? As a winner. You look like a winner to me. [SIGHS] Maybe we better get back to Zing's, you know. That's if you don't want cold coffee. Right. [BIKES REVVING] [SHOUTING] Yes, that was good. He's got to be the ugliest guy I've ever seen with a helmet. Yeah! Whoo! I want a beer, I need a beer! I bet Harvey's got some stashed away here. Whiskeys.Harv! [WHOOPING] My man! Appreciate it, bud. You crazy bastard! You nearly killed me out there! You do that to me once more, I'm taking you straight to the Federation. Yeah? Huh, my man, has to run to momma 'cause he skinned his knee. You want some O'Rourke? Huh? Yeah. You know, O'Rourke, you're really getting on my nerves. You're such a big pussy, you know that? Cool it! Cool it! Yeah, boy!Shut up, shut up, both of you! Now, if you've got a complaint, or you, I want to hear about it first before the Federation! Am I understood? Yeah!Yeah! All right. Now, this is my track and you two are on it. Now I want you to mellow out. Mr. Sinclair.Yeah. What the hell do you want? What can I do for you, son? Well, I'd like a minute of your time, sir, if you can spare it. Oh, give me a fucking break! Sure, I got a minute. Follow me back to the office. Hey, Rick, how you feeling, bud? Hey! Now, I want you guys to hit the showers. Now! And, Harvey, if I have to tell you again to get rid of that beer... Mr. Sinclair.Yeah, go kiss his ass, O'Rourke. I blew it. It won't happen again. I should hope not. Well, what can I do for you, son? Well, I'd like to race, sir, you know, professionally. I'm not stopping you.I want a shot on your team, Mr. Sinclair. What's your name?Kagan, Ricky Kagan. Ha! You are Jack Kagan's son? Yes, sir, I am. Wouldn't touch you with a dead whore. Look, I can ride, Mr. Sinclair. So I've been told. I also have been told you're nothing but trouble and I don't need that. Look, I'll do anything if you just, just give me a chance.Well, stories is just stories. Sometimes they're not true. What kind of a mechanic are you? I can hold my own. All right, son, I'll give you a chance, I got a spot, but it's for a mechanic. Now, I don't want to hear a word out of you about racing. If the spot comes up, you've got it, till then, you can ride your bike on the track at night, in your time. Am I understood? I don't have a bike. That's not what I was told. Yeah. Well, I don't have one now. All right, look, see my assistant, Sid. He'll fill you in on details, you can use one of the track bikes. Start tomorrow, eight thirty.Okay. Great. I appreciate it. Oh, one more thing, Mr. Sinclair. Sing to me, son, and make it a good tune. Look, I need a place to stay. Anything you have at all will do. You're a right royal piece of work, now, aren't you? God. All right, I'll tell you what. You see Sid. There's a shack over there. You're quite welcome to it. I mean, it's nothing special, but you can have it, if you can put up with the rats. Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Mr. Sinclair. Hey, uh, Ricky.Yeah? I wasn't kidding about the rats. [SCREAMING] Are you okay? No, no, no! No more, no more, no more! Ow! I don't give a shit. There are no exceptions. Do you understand? You wanted to see me, Mr. Sinclair? One man's loss is another man's gain, huh, son? O'Rourke's out of the race on Saturday, possibly for the rest of the season. Now, I want you on the team. Do you think you can handle it? Yeah, you bet I'm up to it. What are you doing at the moment, son? Nothing, I was just working on O'Rourke's crank shaft. I want to see you ride. Get yourself in a pair of leathers, grab a bike and I'll meet you out on the track, in say, 15 minutes? You got it. Uh, look. Mr. Sinclair, thanks a lot. You don't know what this means to me. Yes, I do, son. Yes! Run again? That was one hell of a jump. Now where did you learn to ride like that? Running from the cops. We heard from Sid you're replacing O'Rourke with Kagan. Is that true? Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am. You got a problem with that? Yes, sir, I do. All right, Zack. What is it?I won't ride with him. You know what happened to my brother. There's no way I'm going to ride with the kid that left my brother in the dust. Jesus! Just give it a rest! Whoa! Now listen. What happened that night happened a long time ago and it's all over. Besides, he's been doing one hell of a job around here. And he rides like the devil. As far as I'm concerned, he's on the team. Then, sir. I'm sorry. I'm off. Count me out too, sir. And you too?And me too. God! Look, um... I'm sorry, son. I can't trade you for the whole team much aid all as I'd like to, so I guess I'm... That's all right, that's all right. I understand. I'll see you around sometime. [SIGHS] Hope you're satisfied. I am. Can we talk? Now, wait a minute. I'd like to talk to you. There's nothing to talk about. How's the job going? [SCOFFS] As well as you'd expect. What's that mean?It means I quit! Okay? That fit the program? I really don't care about that. You must have had your reasons.Are you sure? Hey, I didn't come here to fight. Then you better leave. Okay, I'll leave. Maybe we can talk a little... Rick! Hey, Rick! Rick! Rick![MOTORCYCLE REVVING] Rick! MEGAN: Ricky?[FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Well, where have you been? Where have I been? Waiting for you to came out of hiding. Actually, I came by yesterday, but you weren't here. Yeah? I was out. This place is a pig sty. What, are you out of dish soap or something? That's a possibility. [DISHES CLATTERING] Look, will you just leave that stuff? Jesus! Ricky, what is your problem? Why are you giving up? Why are you wimping out just because life is unpredictable? Unpredictable?Yes. I'll you what's unpredictable. My father's unpredictable! You're unpredictable! Now this fucking track is unpredictable! Damn it! Ricky, stop it! What is wrong with you? Why are you doing this? Can't you see that I love you and I'm trying to help you? Don't you...Well it's just not worth it, Megan! Yes, it is worth it, damn it! God! I love you! Stop this, please. I do love you. Wait. Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. [MOTORCYCLE REVVING] Ooh, coffee, yeah, thank you. You're welcome. I have a surprise for you. What? You married? No, silly. What is it? Well, if you want to know what it is, you have to get up and get dressed and come with me. Oh, it's an adventure, I see. Yeah, well, in a way, but it's better than an adventure. Okay, well, I'm game.Good. What's this? Josh. I'm not... I'm not ready for this yet. You will be. Look, I can't see him like this. He's not "like this." Come on. Oh, hi, Megan, go on in, he's awake. Okay, thank you. Wait. What? Do you know her or something? You work here? [WHISPERS] Josh. [WHISPERS] Hi. Hey, buddy, how you doing? All right, motherfucker! Oh, man, I thought you were just about one dead son of a bitch.[SHUSHING] We're not in the Pink Slipper. Well, we ought to be, hey, Pancho? Wait a minute. Why didn't you tell me he was okay? I mean, what the hell's going on here? Hey, this is only my first day back in the land of the living. MEGAN: We weren't sure until last night. Weren't sure of what? JOSH: I've been pretty sick, Rick. Kinda critical. You better lay off of Megan, huh? Otherwise, you got me kicking your hot shot ass right around this hospital. You got that, huh? [LAUGHING]Yeah! Oh, God! Guys, guys! It's good to see you, man, but this boy's got to cop some more Z's, okay? Hey, come on, man, don't bullshit me. How is it in there? Tired. I feel sore.Mmm-hmm. But okay. Hey, I'm going to be all right. No shit. Come on, get out of here. All right, Pancho, but I'm going to be back here with a naked woman and a bottle of whiskey. Like hell you will. Bye.Bye. Hey, Ricko... Yo. Don't give up your dreams. What is he talking about? I feel like I'm in the middle of a mystery and everybody knows the ending, but me. That's exactly where you are. [SIGHS] [MOTORCYCLE ROARING]Whoo! All right! Now stop, stop, stop, stop. RICKY: Very nice, oh.MEGAN: Oh no! Wait! Do you trust me? About half the time. Oh! Is this a trust half or no trust half? Megan, get to it. Wait here.Why? Count to 100 slowly. One, two...And after I'm inside, okay? Okay.And no cheating. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...Wait 'til I get inside. 15, 16, 17...Hey! I said wait until 100. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 35, 40... 100! [SIGHS] We're both yours! How did you get this? How did you get it through the door? And... My God. Look at this. [CHUCKLES] These. My God! And these! Jesus! Oh, God, look at that. Wait a minute. Megan, you got to tell me where all this came from. All I have to do is make sure that you know it's yours. What you have to do is get out on that track and practice. Sinclair's not going to let me ride on the team just 'cause I got a new bike. Hey, you can enter the regional finals as an independent. That's if you qualify. How do you know that? I just, uh, never mind. No, no, no. Wait a minute! Wait a minute here. Stop. Come here, come here. [SIGHS] Thank you.You're welcome. Now, you got to tell me where all this came from. No, I don't. Come on, come on, don't. Where you going? Uh, out. But you just gave me all this stuff and you know... Tomorrow we'll see if you can ride that thing, okay? I can ride. Mmm, well. I'll be here at 8:00 am tomorrow, okay? You just be ready, hmm? Oh, come on. [GIGGLING] Come on, where you going? Tomorrow! What are you doing with my father? Rick, your dad has been coming to the track for days. He's been keeping his distance because he was afraid you'd get mad at him. But, Ricky, your dad cares about you very much. He bought your bike. He loves you. [CHUCKLES]I love you. Look, I'm sick of being treated like a child! We're not treating you like a child. If you'd just understand. We're trying to help...Yeah, I understand all I need to understand. Ricky, would you just listen? He cares about you very much. He does, Ricky! If you'll just give him a chance... Well, don't tell me about my father, okay? Don't tell me about something I know about, and you don't! Look, I'm not trying to tell you... Wait a minute! God! Hi, Mom. [SNIFFLING] I'm having [CHUCKLES] a real tough time lately. And... I don't know what to do. KAGAN: Richard? RICKY: How dare you come here? Haven't you got any respect for her? How could you come here and mock her like this? I'm not mocking your mother, I loved her. More than anything else in the world, except you. Yeah, love? What the hell do you know about love, man? Huh? The only thing you ever loved was Jack Kagan and that damn metal factory! Steel. Of course, Father, steel. Do you know why it's so easy for you to hate me? Huh? Because I've risked everything for a life of substance. You think that comes without a certain price? I don't know what you're talking about. Well, maybe I'm going to tell you something. Something I never thought I would tell you. You know there's no easy way to say this. Your mother... Your mother was a dreamer and she liked to drink. She left me, but she abandoned you. You cheated on her! You ran around with other women! How can you say that she left you, huh? And how the hell can you say that she left me? She worked herself to death to try to keep us going. Ricky, I made some mistakes, but I loved your mother, I loved her. I regretted what I did and I told her. I told her, I begged her not to leave, but I don't know, she was too deeply hurt and she would never forgive me. After she left, when I finally realized that she wasn't coming back, I tried to support both of you. [SCOFFS] She refused. She refused repeatedly. I mean, and let me tell you, she was in no position to refuse. It was some kind of misplaced pride. She put the both of you at risk unnecessarily, because of pride, I mean, she did that. She didn't have anything left! I loved her, I wanted her back. She wouldn't come and she wouldn't accept anything from me. You're full of shit. No, not now. And I'll tell you something. I'll be damned if I'm going to let you go to hell for the rest of your life for my mistakes. Don't walk away from me. Stop it!I will not stop! Son of a bitch! Look, I may be a son of a bitch, but I love you and I'm not going to let you go! Come here! [SOBBING] I missed you. [MOTORCYCLES REVVING] COMMENTATOR: Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Tri State Motocross Championship. As you can see, it's a perfect day for the race. All I can tell you is the view from up here is breathtaking. My name is Ed Fox, and I'll be giving you a bird's eye picture of the race. MEGAN: Hey, Ricky! Hi.Hi. LAURA: It's going to be rough out there against that whole pack of jerks. She's right. Hey, he's going to do just fine. Hey, Laura Lee, could I have one of those pickles? LAURA: Nervous, huh? Hey, where are you going? RICKY: I'll be right back. Save me some, all right? You okay, Rick? Yeah, I guess I'm just a little nervous. [SIGHS] I sure would be. Hi.Hi, how are you? Good, thanks. Isn't it great? It sure is. [SIGHS]How's he doing? A little jittery, I think. Oh, I know I am. Listen, it's all survivable. Yeah. Hey, Jer, have a good race! You got it. We have an unusual entry in today's main event. Ricky Kagan has been given special permission to enter the finals. Hey, Zack, Josh is okay. Yeah, and that doesn't change anything. [CROWD CHEERING]COMMENTATOR: Now, before I introduce the riders, let me introduce some of the sponsors, Yamaha, Suzuki and Kawasaki Motorcycle Corporations, and the Portland Zoo, and the Camel cigarette people. [MOTORCYCLES REVVING] The bikes are starting to line up for this winner-take-all championship. Uh-oh, there seems to be a slight altercation in the lineup. Did you see that?Yeah, I did. Between tough rider Zack Kapinski and newcomer Ricky Kagan. Kapinski, State Champion and today's favorite is the one to beat. Bumping into Kagan's rear tire looks to me like a grudge match and Ricky Kagan seems like he's not afraid of abuse. If this is any indication of the animosity between these two riders, it means this race is going to be hot. That Kapinski is in the top 20 of the best riders of the American Motocross Federation. And he is number one. Also on Sinclair's team is Harvey Stewart riding lucky number 13. One of the most skillful riders is Leroy Mattheus, riding number 17. And block contender Luke Stevens, number nine. They're getting ready now. Now the race is about to start. We're all waiting for the starting gate to drop any moment now. The tension is building up. And they're off! [MOTORCYCLES ROARING] Well, coming down the track it's Zack Kapinski, still in the lead, with the rest of Sinclair's team not too far behind. Kagan is pulling up in the inside on the tail of number nine. Over the table top it's Kapinski number one, Stevens number nine and Stewart number three. [CROWD CHEERING] Number seventeen, and Ricky Kagan is now in fourth place and pouring on the power! There he goes, folks! Ricky Kagan has overtaken Leroy Mattheus on the inside! Just look at that boy ride! [CHEERING] He's hanging in there. Now Kagan's back in. These riders will do anything to keep Ricky Kagan from getting through! [SCREAMS] It's still Kapinski in the lead, with Kagan on his tail. Coming right through is Stevens giving Kagan a metal sandwich. Whoops, there he's down. Stewart's down again! They're heading into the last lap with several drivers coming up from behind and towards the finish as Kapinski opens up and Kagan cannot tag him! Kapinski is roaring forward toward a victory! And now Kagan opens up. He's after Kapinski. It's Kapinski and Kagan. Now over the last boop-de-doo. Kagan overtakes Kapinski! What a move! Yeah, kick ass, Ricky! ...inside and he's in the lead. Now, Kapinski is back in the lead on the outside! What a race! What a race! That's Kapinski and Ricky Kagan at the table top, going for the checkered flag! And there... There it is! There he is, Ricky takes the gold! [CHEERING] Whoo! Yeah! [ALL CHEERING] ZACK: Hello! Hey! Hello! Ricky!Whoo-hoo! Hello! ZACK: Yeah, whoa! Hay, boy! ZACK: Yeah! Nice car. Red's my favorite color. Shut up! Get out of here! What do you think you're doing?Whoo! Ricky's a lucky little boy. ZACK: Oh, shut up.MEGAN: Get out of here, you guys! Knock it off! Shut up! Shut up! Goddamn! Let me... [SCREAMING] LUKE: Zack! Zack! That's not what we came to do! MEGAN: Wait! No! Shut the fuck up! Stop that! You like that? Huh? You like that shit? I love that shit! You like it? Yeah? Huh? Yeah! Huh! Get out of my face, girl. [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING] Do you think they got any potato chips? Oh, not now! Oh, never mind. Lucky they left this stuff. RICKY: Hey, honey, what's Freddie's car doing? Ricky, oh, Ricky! What the hell happened? Zack trashed the place. Let Megan tell it.Did he hurt you? He knocked her flat. Shut up! Are you going to be okay? Yeah, I'll be fine.You're all right? Yeah.All right. Freddie, you take care of her. Wait a minute! Where are you going? Wait, don't go! Son of a bitch! Ricky, where are you going? Ricky, don't go after him! It's what he wants you to do, Ricky. Please, don't!Megan, he's gotta be taught a lesson! No! Not like this.Honey, please, please, go inside. No, Ricky, please, don't go.Go inside. No, Ricky, stay! Freddie will take care of you. No! Please!Go inside. No way I'm going to miss that shot! Folks, here you go! Whoo-hoo! Oh, shit! Hey, hey, a bike just blew up out there! Let's go! [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] Save it for him. You see him? No. He couldn't just disappear! Shit! He's got to be around here somewhere, man. You guys stay out here and you cover all the doors and you don't let him out, Luke, you got it! Yeah!You got it? Yeah! Right!All right! Let's get the little son of bitch! [BIKE ENGINE WHIRRING] [GRUNTING] [ALARM RINGING] ZACK: Hey, wabbit! Now, what's the matter, you wascalley little wabbit? You out of breath? Huh? Well, hey, wabbit, what are you going to do, homestead that piece of cement? Hey, this is our spot, little fellow. You and I are going to do us a little dance right here in the moonlight. Oh, come on, Ricky, just give me this little dance, huh? This, this could be our last one. Daddy might fly you off to school or something and that'd be it for us and oh, my heart just turns to shit when I think of you off someplace where I can't get my hands on you. Get off the fucking bike, asshole! Get off the fucking bike! Ricky? Where the hell did you run to? You couldn't leave it alone, could you, man? Fuck you, man! Well, now you crossed the line, man. Nobody fucks with my home or my family. Stay down![GROANS] [GASPING] Get up. [GASPING] That's it. You just don't know when to quit, do you? I didn't think you had it in you. You didn't think I had it I me. You didn't think I had what in me? Give me a hand up. Yeah, right. Are you kidding? Yeah, well, Jesus, at least I'm not stupid enough to want to hang around some guy who wants to bust my butt. [GROANS] And maybe you don't have it in you. [MOANS] No, shit, man. I just had to get in one more shot, I'm through, that's it. You're through? You're through? I kicked your ass, and you're through? Shit! You didn't kick my ass. All right. This town kicked my ass. Oh, shit! That goddamned factory kicked my ass! And your daddy kicked my ass! And you man, you have everything and you piss on it! And it doesn't matter if I piss on it, I will never have it! Now all I ever have is long hours and overdue fucking bills! Listen, man, don't preach to me. No, you listen. I have had to train myself to hate what I knew I couldn't have. Do you have any idea how hard that is? Do you know what a fucking weird way that is to live your life? Huh? Yeah.Yeah. I think we're through here man. Yeah. Oh, shit!My face hurts. [CHUCKLES] [SIRENS WAILING] Oh, fuck!Oh, Jesus. Come on. Follow me. Follow you? Don't follow me, all right. Look, if you go down, don't hold it against me. Yeah, I won't go down, buddy. Good, then we ain't got a problem in the whole world.
