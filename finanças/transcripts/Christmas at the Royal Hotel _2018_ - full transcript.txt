[stage lights sound effect] [music] Now for the news headlines... This week parliament approved a measure to expand the mobilisation of the Canadian armed forces, as the country repositions itself on a wartime footing. On the European war front Leningrad is now totally under siege by the German army. It looks like Adolph Hitler is trying to starve the Russians into submission. In China, the Japanese Imperial army faces stubborn Chinese resistance, over their fight over the capital of Hunan Province. In other news, the British passenger ship Empire Eland was torpedoed and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean by a German submarine. There are no reports of any survivors. In London, Winston Churchill gave a speech regarding the war... [music] [laughs] Hi honey. How did you sleep? Yeah, good. Have you heard any updates about your deployment to Hong Kong? I met with the unit Colonel yesterday. Our troop ship is going to depart Vancouver on October 25th. Do you really have to go? You... You could get a desk job in Ottawa. Deployment is only going to be six months, maybe a year. Hey look! At least I am not being sent to Europe. That's where the real fighting is. But there are rumours that the Japanese are going to attack Hong Kong. Yeah, but... They're not. Attacking the British would be foolish. Besides, Japan is bogged down in China. So... No Christmas with my big soldier? Not this year. But I promise next year, we can go cross country skiing in Banff. Even stay at the Fairmont Hotel. But just... be careful out there. I want you to come home, and keep all your promises. (music) Welcome to the Royal Hotel, how may I be of service? I wanted to know if this hotel has good privacy? I understand sir. We do have quite a reputable collection of human curiosities here at this establishment. Journalists, businessmen, diplomats, military officers of course, and... maybe a few mistresses. Do you require a room for one or two people sir? Actually, two people... myself and... A special friend? Yes, right. You understand. Yes, sir. Do you need a room short term or long term? Maybe a week. I see, a new relationship. We do charge double the normal rate for short term stays sir. May I suggest a one month stay would be a much better deal for you. Ok, put me down for one month. Excellent, well... I have room 205 ready and available for you sir. Enjoy your stay at the Royal, your comfort and privacy is all part of our regal service. Thank you. Hi, I have a reservation under Tom Meyers. Ah, you must be one of our new Canadian arrivals. Yes, our ship docked this morning. Well, welcome to the Royal Hotel, let me just check your reservation. Yes, we have your reservation here. It seems they must have run out of room at the barracks sir, as we have a couple other Canadian officers staying here. I guess it's my lucky day then. Yes, indeed... Ah Miss! You have a letter! Just one moment. There you are. Thank you Chunmay. You are welcome. Any phone calls for me today? Not today Miss. Thank you. Sorry for that disruption sir. We have room 212 ready and available for you. Do you need the services of a Bell Boy? No, I can handle things. OK There you go sir. Enjoy you stay at the Royal. Thank you. (phone rings) Hello this is Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? Ok, just a second. I will patch you through room 109. [phone rings] Hello this is Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? Ok, just a moment. Hello, this is the Royal Hotel switchboard operator. I have a call for Mr. Mak in room 303 for Peninsula Hotel. Ok. Sir you are now connected to room 303 at Peninsula Hotel. [phone rings] Hello, how may I place your call? Just a second. Hello sir I have put you through to room 202. It's been like this all day, call after call. Is that the latest batch of mail? Yeah, that is the latest batch. Lily, why do you keep doing this to yourself? It's been three years since the fighting in Shanghai. It's highly doubtful that your parents survived. Until I know the truth, I will keep looking for them. Ah, you are going to love this. The latest batch from the post office. It looks like I am not leaving tonight. [phone rings] Hello this is Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? Ok, just a second. [city sounds] [knock on door] Please, come in. Am I too early? No, of course not. Please take a seat. Can I interest you in a glass of whiskey? No thank you. I will toast for the both of us then. This interview will be kept off the record, background use only. Fully off the record, right? Yes. There are rumours circling the KMT that the Japanese are building their forces in Canton. Do you have any comment about this? The Japanese are fighting the Nationalists and Communists armies on multiple fronts. It is possible the Japanese want to hit deeper into China. Where do you source these rumours? I have my sources. So you are not worried the additional Japanese troops might be used on a attack on Hong Kong? We take the repositioning of any Japanese troops seriously. The fact remains that the Japanese are fully bogged down in China. It does not make any military sense for them to open up another front and attack a peaceful British colony. But according to my sources, the Japanese landed over ten thousand more troops last month alone. My intel numbers say differently, but I can not discuss them. And if my sources are correct, the Japanese could completely overwhelm your defence lines. Like I said, it is unlikely that the Japanese would open up another front. So you are not worried about an attack on Hong Kong? Well we are prepared for anything. A contingent of over two thousand Canadian troops arrived today in Hong Kong. We are planning for any contingency when it comes to the Japanese. Tell me. Why did the British military openly announce the Canadians arrival? Was that a message for the Japanese? Hopefully it will make them think twice. Be sure to include those numbers in your article. So... I hear you are staying at the Royal Hotel. Yes I am. I saw several Canadian soldiers checking in today. Well, unfortunately the barracks in Sham Shu Po are a little crowded. We decide to billet some of the officers elsewhere. Of course. Nothing like being dropped knee deep in a nest full of refugees, thugs and spies now, huh? Well, we did warn them about that. Thank you for coming in. Good day. [door clicks shut] Good evening madam, how can I help you? I would like to inquire if you might have a room available? Yes madam we do. Good, good. You see the trouble is I am a bit short on Hong Kong dollars. But I do have currency from my homeland. I know that the exchange rate might not be the most favourable at this hotel. But I would be most indebted to you if you would be so kind, as to help me in this matter. Hmm, this is Hungarian currency madam. Yes, I know. I emigrated from Budapest. The war in Europe forced me to leave. I don't have Hong Kong dollars. Might you have another currency madam? No! These Hungarian Pengos are all that I have. I am sorry madam, but we can not accept this as payment. Could you not make an exception in my case? This is a real currency from a great country. I am sorry madam, but these banknotes are basically worthless in Hong Kong. [music] Hello, this is Royal Hotel how may I place your call? Ok, Mr. Jankins in room 240, let me patch you through. [phone rings] Hello this is Royal Hotel how may I place your call? Here you go sir. Thank you very much. Hungry? Yeah, a little bit. Thank you. Umm, they are good. By the way, what are you doing for Christmas? Umm, serving guests, running errands, nothing much planned. Well you know... I ah... Cause I... I was going to... What? Are you asking me to spend Christmas with you? [laughs] If you have nothing else to do. Bowie, we are both war refugees living in this hotel. We have no family, no encumbrances. So yes, I would very much love to spend the Christmas with you. Great, that's great. Do you want to do anything special? Hmm... Actually I have never celebrated Christmas before. Do they have dances like I see in the movies? [singing] Actually, Christmas is really about spending time with family and eating a lot of food. Oh, so... That's like Chinese holiday? They also exchange a lot of gifts. Ahh... that's why Christmas is so popular. [knock on door] Is this the mailroom? Yes it is, how may I help you? I would like to send this letter to Chungking. Is it possible? Well yes it is possible. I can help you. Mail service these days is very slow and expensive. Do you have the right postage? Yes, that's enough postage. Mail flight leaves once a week. Is it urgent? Just a personal letter, to my parents. Oh... It should get there in time. As long as you have the right address. Hopefully they have not moved. It is hard to tell during these wartimes. I like your dress. I have seen you around the hotel a lot. Thank you Lily. For all your hard work. [door closes] At least she has a family address. [city sounds] Um-hum, Sergeant Tom Meyers from the Winnipeg Grenadiers recon team reporting for duty sir. Welcome to Hong Kong Sergeant. I hope you did not suffer too much seasickness on the voyage across the Pacific. In top shape. Three weeks at sea, it's all part of the conditioning sir. Hmm... Well from what I've seen the Canadian troops could do with a lot more training. These Japs have been in a war for years. They are battle harden, well conditioned and experienced. Understood, sir, ut we won't let you down. Hmm... Now there are two mindsets as to what can happen here in Hong Kong. First, is that the Japanese will not attack the colony. If that's the case, we have nothing to fear. And life will go on as usual. That's what I read back home in the newspapers sir. Yes, and that what many people here think as well. But there are rumours that the Japanese might launch a surprise attack. If that were the case, effectively it would be almost impossible to defend the colony. What do you think will happen sir? Well, I have my doubts that the Japanese will attack. But still, our jobs are to prepare for a possible invasion. Now let me give you a quick briefing. Do you see this area here? That our first main defensive line. The Gin Drinkers' Line. It's a series of fortifications that run along these ridge-lines close to the Chinese border. Now if the Japs break through this line, effectively the Kowloon Peninsula would fall. We would be trapped, here on Hong Kong island. Under siege with very little food or water. But would the British Royal Navy not resupply us from the seas? Well yes, that's the hope. But we only have a few battleships here in the Pacific. Most of the Royal Navy are on the European front. I see, the situation is far more precarious than I originally thought. Look, keep this to yourself. But hopefully the Japanese won't attack. As it would cause quite a backlash with the international community. The Americans have already imposed sanctions for war atrocities in Asia. Hopefully the Japanese won't escalate tensions any further. Understood, let's hope so. [music] May I join you? Have we met before? No, I don't think so. I saw you at the hotel hallway, and I believe our rooms are on the same floor. My name is Mr. Cheung. So what brings you to Hong Kong Mr. Cheung? I am a businessman, trader, import, export. Everybody does that around here. A bit boring, wouldn't you say? But profitable. Ah, you are one of those. A profiteer. Now please don't judge. War is what it is. And for an enterprising person, I see no reason why he should waste his talents when opportunities arise. Even in times like these. Ah, I see. So while a few find it in themselves to benefit, so many others suffer. [laughs] May I ask you a question? Why is it that a beautiful woman like yourself is sitting alone at the Royal? You don't recognize me, Mr. Cheung? Have we met before? I am an actress. I used to work in Shanghai at a movie studio. I made quite a few films. Oh yes! That's right! It's alright, I was never the lead. I figured the Royal would be the best place to meet a movie producer, get my career back on track. Maybe I can help? Oh... Do you know of any movie producers Mr. Cheung? A few in fact. Right, I must be off. I have an appointment. Perhaps a drink at another time? If the war does not get to us first. [music] Bugger! You suckered me out of my last 5 dollars. Do you want your 5 dollars back? No, I need to clean up. Less alcohol, less women. I suppose if we do die tomorrow it does not really matter. I hope somebody remembers us. Dust off our graves. Our names etched in stone. Maybe that's what we lave behind, our names. It's a simple reminder that we gave our future for their tomorrow. Come on, one more game. Then we call it a night. [music] Good evening sir. How can I help you? I was wondering the procedure for placing a telephone call to Canada? Rather difficult sir. Is this to be a business or personal call? Personal. It's to my wife in Winnipeg. I see. Well as you can imagine most overseas calls are reserved for the military and important businesses. In addition you would need to get approval, due to security reasons, and this will take a day or two. If your request is actually granted, it might take another 24 hours to actually place the call, depending upon overseas telephone traffic. Now mind you, there are no guarantees that you will be able to hear much, as many times the telephone lines are full of noise and static that you may not hear clearly all. And finally, there is the issue of payment. The hotel requires a 12 dollar deposit for a 3 minute call, as that is the standard rate for North America. 12 dollars! I am afraid so sir. But that's a weeks salary! Maybe sending a letter would be a better option. Yeah, I guess so. Our mail room is one the first floor by the stairway, and you can buy postage stamps from there. [city sounds] Lily! Lily it's you isn't it? Oh my God! Ah Ping! [beggar asks for money] What are you doing in Hong Kong? I just arrived yesterday. I smuggled through the Shenzhen border. It was difficult, very difficult. How? Three years ago in Shanghai? I made it out of Shanghai alive. Then I went over to Nanjing, then I headed over to Canton a year later. It's a miracle to see you here. On the streets like this. Lily, I saw your sister last week. What?! Edna! She is alive? Yes! I saw her in Canton last week. Oh my God, My God! My sister! Do you have her address? No, she was moving through the city with thousands of other refugees. I think they were heading for Chungking. Did she mention anything about our parents? You didn't know? What happened in Shanghai? Please, I just need to know the truth. They died in a bombing. Their house collapsed under a Japanese bomb. Your sister escaped with minor injuries, but your parents... they were killed. I'm sorry. They're gone? I'm sorry. We all have lost family and friends in this terrible war. At least I saw your sister, she looks healthy. Hmm, how can I find her? How can I make contact with her? I don't know. I just saw her across the border somewhere. No address? Well... at least she is alive. Alive! I have to go. My ship is leaving for Singapore in a bit. Why? Stay here with me, have dinner with me! I can't. I'm sorry. I have to go. There are only so many ships leaving Hong Kong these days. Hong Kong is not safe anymore. It could be targeted for Japanese occupation, or even worse. How can I reach you? Do you have an address? Hopefully we can reconnect after this war. I have to go. [music] [door locked] [woman screams] [yelling] [soldier moaning] Are you OK? I didn't expect them to use a knife. They are cowards. What did they want? What happened? I don't know. They just attacked me. Aren't you staying at the Royal Hotel? Yes. Shouldn't we go to the police? No! No, that would take too much time. But could you walk me back to the hotel? Sure, I could use a stiff whiskey. Me too. Oh darling, I wonder what your days are like. Hong Kong is so far away. I have written each week but I wonder if my letters do reach you. The mail service to Asia is dreadful. And each morning I spring open the mail box and still there is nothing from you. I wonder which way the mail reaches you in Asia, from the East or maybe from the West. The thought of spending Christmas apart is dreadful. Please, please stay safe darling. Oh, and I have some BIG news... [music] Is that what I think it is? Shit, they are so close! This right here is the Chinese border. At least this ridge gives us a good view of their activities. This is basically the front line, just a bit of muddy swampland between us and those Japs. Has there been any unusual movements? Troop buildup? Any activities? No, it has been quite quiet down there, apart from the occasional rifle shot for target practice. How much further until the bunker? Just 200 meters down this trail. Alright, let's keep moving. I used to love hiking with my father. What, back in Canada? Yeah, he used to love to go camping. One day, I went to get some water, at a stream about half a mile away from camp. As I got close to the stream, I remember I heard this rustling in the bushes. Instinctively I knew it was a bear. This big grizzly, mad as hell. Without hesitation it charged at me. I remember my hands shaking as I stared down the barrel of the gun. Straight into its angry black eyes. I waited, waited for the bear to get close enough. When it was about 15 feet away, I pulled the trigger. Nothing. The gun had jammed. The bear had stopped, about 6 feet away. And it seemed like forever as we just stared at each other, both standing on the same trail. Then with this big ole snort, the bear turned its massive body back into the bushes. It was over. I felt so fragile, and scared. The bear could have ripped me in half that day. But I guess it was not my day to die. I retreated back to the campsite, and when I got there I cleaned and oiled my gun to perfection. I guess I learned that day that you can never be too prepared for a fight. I would have pissed my pants. I think I did! So how did you get into the British army? Well, kind of like you I was recruited in Bombay. And my father served with the British army during the Great War. I am a family man and being a soldier brings a good steady pay check. You look young to be a father. He is the reason why I serve. How old is he? Almost four years old now. Happy looking guy don't you think? He looks like a rabble-rouser to me. I have never actually seen him. I was moved to Hong Kong before he was born. They are back in Bombay? I will be back soon. My 4 years are almost over. I am sure it will be a massive celebration. I would love to be a father. Let's hope those Japs don't have other plans. Boys! [ship's horn] [snoring, phone rings] Hello. Royal Hotel, how may I help you? Yes, hello... can you please bring me three cha siu bao to room 208? OK, I will be right up. [snoring] [knock on door] Come on in. Here are your cha siu bao, madam. Smells good, thank you. Place it on the table please. Will that be all madam? Yes, that should do it. Here you go. Thank you. Hope you have a wonderful evening. Thank you. Actually... Yes madam? I do have one more request. [ship's horn] Well, that's all of them. How would your sister even know that you are working at the Royal? Maybe she runs into somebody on the street and they remember me working here. Possible, I guess. Hey, look. Hope is all I got. Without it, I have nothing. Nothing. Do you think the boss would give us a little time off for Christmas? I don't know. Christmas is pretty busy here. We probably need all hands on deck for things to run smoothly. I hate to think we have to spend Christmas in this mail room. We will see what happens. [loud squeaks from upstairs] What's that? [woman moaning] What room is above us? Room 208 That is Mayling's room. Sounds like she is conducting a job interview with a movie producer. [woman's orgasmic moaning] [phone rings] I have a call. Hello this is Royal Hotel, how may I help you? Yes, Mr. Murray... I understand... We are looking into the situation right now... Yes, I know. This is very immoral and we do not condone this. [loud moan] [phone rings] Can you give me a minute? I have another call coming in. [woman's orgasmic moaning] Yes, we are going to find someone to fix it. Just give me a second, I have another call. Hello this is Royal... [loud moaning] Yes, you are not the only one. [phone rings] Give me a minute, I have another call coming in. [squeaky bed spring noises] [woman's orgasmic squeals] [loud bed spring noises] [woman moaning] [phone rings] HQ, hello? Colonel, it's for you. Yes, speaking. What? What!!! This is unbelievable! We need those trucks and personal carriers. How are we supposed to operate without them? Look! What do you want my troops to do? Ride horses to the battle front! This is not the Great War! This is unbelievable! The Japanese have mechanised divisions, they have mobile artillery, they have tanks! Yes, well someone in Ottawa should have their head cut off. This is unbelievable! The San Jose is floating somewhere in the Pacific. The supply ship for the Canadian troops. They estimate a late arrival. Sometime in mid-December! Bloody incompetence! Here is the latest batch of mail. Enjoy. I could barely keep up, it was crazy last night Yeah. There were quite a few cancellations this morning. I guess some of our guests just don't think our hotel, is up to their standard. Maybe it's because sometimes this place feels like a bordello. Bordello? What does that mean? A bordello means a whore house you dummy. Bordello, whore house, brothel, all mean the same thing. Didn't you hear the woman last night? [laughs] That was funny! [knock on door] Come on in. Hello, is this the mail room? Yes, sir. How may I help you? Well I... I have not received any of my mail from my wife back in Canada. And I have been here three weeks now. I just wanted to make sure my mail was getting through to me. Airmail service to Hong Kong is really slow. Letters from Canada or United States typically arrive around... one to two months late. When you do get a letter though, I will make sure you get it. OK Just I am really anxious, you see I haven't heard anything from my wife back in Canada. What's your name? Tom Meyers, room 205. OK, I will keep an eye out for any letters addressed to you. If you do get it, I will make sure the Bell Boy get it to you personally. OK, thank you. Much appreciated. It must be so hard on these young men being away from home. Not hearing from their friends and family for months. Well since you seem to go through the mailing first, want to keep an eye out for Tom's letters? [music] Good morning, Mr. Cheung, how may I be of service to you today? Any messages for me? Let me check. Oh, I am sorry to inform you, but there are no messages for you today. Fine. Hello, yes... He's coming. [music] [city sounds] Good evening Mayling. Mr. Cheung, how is business? Just finishing up for tonight. And you... Are you going somewhere? No, in fact I am coming back from a party at the Foreign Correspondents Club. They serve a wicked martini. Sorry, I'm a little bit tipsy at the moment. I was just heading downstairs to try to find a hotel member to help me hang my painting I purchased today. Really, a painting? Yes. Maybe I can be of help? Oh... Well, sure if you have a moment. I purchased it from a family who lives on the Peak. They are leaving Hong Kong, selling everything. You should have seen the view from their apartment. It was gorgeous. Well, should we have a look? Absolutely. Oh! It's ah... Stunning! Aren't they? So, where would you like it? I want them right above my bed. How about here? Ah... a little higher. OK. How about here? Yes, that's perfect. But you know what, let's deal with it later. You can leave them on the bed for now. OK. I have an idea. Hmm... I propose that we toast to your amazing purchase tonight. I agree. [drink pouring] OK. There we are. To the newest member of the association of war profiteers, the stunning Miss Mayling. Cheers! Cheers! [laughs] Do you have another bottle? No, unfortunately I finished that last night. [laughs] Let me call downstairs and get them to bring up another one. [phone dialling] Operator? Hello? [phone dialling] Operator? Hello? Hello? Strange... The phone system, it seems to be down. Oh...? Not to worry, I will go down myself and get us some more. Great. But, don't be late... or I just might change my mind. [laughs] Mr. Cheung, good evening. What can I... I would like a bottle of your best whiskey sent to room 208. If I remember correctly your room is 207. No, no... room 208. We are having a bit of a party there. OK, room 208. OK... Mr Cheung! I have a small request. You see we are trying to run a respectable establishment here. I don't really know how to phrase this... We seemed to have a bit of a disturbance last night. It woke up many of our hotel guests. Hmm... Please could you carry out your activities this evening in a more respectable manner? [music] Alright, patch you to room 211. [phone rings] Hello this is Royal Hotel. How may I place your call? [laughing] You are so delightful. [laughing] You know what I love about this city? It's a conservative city, with a secret wild side. So I've heard. You will have to introduce me to some of these places. No Mr. Cheung. That's imposible. Oh? These clubs are not your style. [laughing] I have to tell you, actually... I am rather broad minded. What's the terminology, I am forward thinking. [laughs] I don't think you fully understand. Maybe I am not being direct enough. Oh I love it! I love it when a woman takes charge! Dominates! Let's you know what she likes. I like girls... Women... Not men. What? You must be joking! No. I am telling the truth Mr. Cheung. Women, are so much better in bed. Being multi-orgasmic and all. Women can go on... and on... and on... Men... just pop off once then you are done. But of course, we are going to keep this secret between the two of us. We would not want a scandal to break out, would we? What would people say? And the fact of you entertaining me in my bedroom... that would be bad for business. Am I correct? Yes. Yes, I believe you're right. But last night? What about last night Mr. Cheung? Did you sleep well? I slept fine. Good night Mr. Cheung. No Japanese troop movement on the border, what are we doing here? Yeah... I don't think we will ever see any action. The Japanese have all the Chinese territories to conquer and occupy. They don't need Hong Kong. This post is a snooze fest. I am sitting here in this port city, and history is just passing us by. Your friends and family back home, do you think they are reading anything about Hong Kong? Nothing. All the big news events, it's all in Europe. [sigh] [phone rings] Headquarters. Yes. What? Really? Holy smokes! Let me get the Colonel. Sir! They just attacked Pearl Harbor! Yes. Yes. Full scale attack? Right, has this been confirmed? Yes. God help us. Gentlemen, the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor. Order all the troops in Hong Kong, STAND TO. We interrupt this broadcast for a special news bulletin. The Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor, I repeat, the Japanese have attacked Pearl Harbor! Moments ago in Washington, President Roosevelt announced that a large force of Japanese bombers and fighter aircraft, launched a surprised attack against the Naval base in the city of Honolulu. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor means that war has come to the Pacific. Roosevelt will soon be asking Congress for a declaration of war on the nation of Japan. This surprise attack has shocked the United States and the World. More details about the attack on Pearl Harbor will be provided as soon as we receive more information from Washington. [distant gunfire] Bunker 12 is under fire. Japanese troops reported 3 miles away near the Sham Chun River. What are the estimates? I need to report this to headquarters. Our spotters say, 5 to 8 thousand troops, tanks, personal carriers are all moving here. To the Sham Chun River? Near Golden Hill sir! Yes headquarters! This is Liverpool Recon, in Bunker position 15. Bunker 12 is under heavy sustained fire! I repeat, Bunker 12 is under heavy sustained fire. Sightings of Japanese troops, 5 to 8 thousand strong crossing the border near Sham Chun River. Yes. Also sightings of tanks and armoured personal carriers. The Japanese troops are moving into position towards Golden Hill. I repeat, the Japanese troops are moving into position towards Golden Hill. Over! Is this really happening? War? [distant gunfire] Not yet sir! You just give me... HELLO? Shit! I don't know what happened... HELLO? I think the line has been cut! Are you sure? Shit, the Japanese have cut the line. Can't be, the Japanese are miles away. That's their main base. They may have soldiers up in the hills. If the lines been cut that means... They are nearby. Shit, I need to get this message to headquarters! Look, I know these hills, I know these trails. I can run down to Bunker 28. I am sure there is a working phone connection. No, it's a damn dangerous mission Charlie. So is being holed up in here sir. If they cut the line they must be nearby. I will move fast. It's going to be damn hard for them to hit a moving target at night. Alright, Charlie. Godspeed. Good luck! [distant gunfire] [gunshot] Shit, what happened? I think Charlie has been shot. We are under attack, we need to take cover. Alright, No... careful Tom... This exit is covered by the Japs. What are our options? Two exits located at the back, but the Japs might have those covered as well. I need to get this message back to headquarters. Alright, I am going to take my chances. You guys go out the front and fire towards the Japanese positions it might buy me some time. Alright? OK, Good luck! Sir! A note for you sir. Damn. Well sorry we have to meet in the interrogation room, but the Command Center is off limits to civilians. No, of course... I understand. As you can imagine, as a journalist I have been many a crazy place. So, what have you got for me? What is that? It's a map of Hong Kong. With Japanese troop formations and British defence lines on it. Damn! Where did you get this map? A Mr. Cheung, he is staying at the Royal Hotel. I believe he will be of interest to you. Who is this Mr. Cheung? I don't know. I am still investigating him myself. How did you get this? I have my methods. Arrest Mr. Cheung at the Royal Hotel immediately. Well, thank you. I wonder who you really are working for? The Communists, the KMT, maybe the Americans. Maybe it's all the above. I hope this was useful for you. Thank you Mayling. Hello Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? OK, let me patch you through room 220. [phone rings] Hello Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? OK, just a second, let me patch you through 120. [sighs] This is probably the last mail bag you are going to get for a while. The Japanese have placed an embargo on the city. All mail service has been suspended. Oh my God. So Hong Kong is totally shut off? Yeah. That's not good. What's in the box? Oh, this is from the tailor shop. It's for you. Oh right, I do remember placing an order last week. So are you going to open it? And what? Ruin your Christmas surprise present? Christmas present! It's not for you silly. Oh... Excuse me, excuse me... excuse me! Now one at time, please one at a time. I think you are next. I need a room for a week, maybe two weeks. I think I know you. Mrs. Leung right? Yes, yes, I used to stay here quite a lot a few years back. I thought I recognized you. So good to see you again. So a room for a week, maybe more, huh? That's right. OK, let me just check. We have the basement room still available, it's rather small, no windows, But it's available starting tonight. How much is it? 5 dollars a night. That's so high, I used to have the Grand Suite for 3 dollars. Hmm, it's the war Mrs. Leung, it's pushing the prices up on everything. I just don't have that kind of money, not anymore. We lost almost everything. But I need a place to stay until I get things sorted. I will put you down for a week at the old rate. Hopefully that will give you enough time to bounce back during these troubled times. Thank you, thank you. Someday I will repay you for your kindness. [music] Get up slowly! No fast moves! What's this all about? You are under arrest Mr. Cheung! There must be some kind of mistake! Silence, save it for your interrogation. [Christmas music playing] We had this military policeman arrest one of our long-term guests in the hotel! It happened in the bar. Everyone saw it! This hotel is turning into a scandal. What's that? That's your Christmas present. Can I open it now? No silly, you have to wait. Oh... I can't wait to spend Christmas with you. Me too Lily, me too. How could our intelligence agents miss this? I don't know sir. It seems the Japanese formed many parts of their military units deep inside the Canton province. Tricking us into thinking they are going to direct that straight into the KMT. According to these maps, the Japanese are going to drive two main forces right around the Gin Drinkers' Line! They will break right through into Kowloon! You're right, sir. Heavy fighting has already broken out in Shing Mun Redoubt, and according to these notes, 50 thousand troops are going to be engaged in this attack. My God! We will be blown off the Kowloon peninsula! With these numbers sir, gives them a 4 to 1 advantage, and they have armoured divisions. There is no way we can hold the Gin Drinkers' Line. They will flood right into Kowloon. I don't think we have any choice sir. I think we have to evacuate right now to Hong Kong island. Yes! Yes! Order a retreat of the troops to Hong Kong island. We will have to retrench there, use the harbor itself as a defence. Yes sir. Alright, order Tom's recon team to the eastern part of the island. The Lyemun passage is the likely place where the Japs will land onshore to attack the island. Emergency evacuation! Come in Eastern Brigade. Come in Eastern Brigade! This is HQ. An emergency evacuation order. Come in Eastern Brigade, come in. This is HQ! Come in! Eastern Brigade! [bomb explosions] [air raid siren] [music] It's too dangerous to go out now. The Japanese are 7 miles away! I can't miss this meeting. I will be back in two hours. Alright? Can you at least tell me where you are going? I have to operate completely in secrecy. All that I can tell you, is that I am meeting Mr. Cheung from Nanking. Why is he so important? This is Mr. Cheung. He might look rough around the edges, but he gets things done. And if we are to defeat the Japanese in China, we need more people like him. Don't be late. We must flee to Hong Kong today. We are not going to miss our boat. Two hours... is all I need. I promise. [music] [distant gunfire, explosions] Mayling! What are you doing here? Let's go! The Japanese are in the neighbourhood. We need to go! Where is Yong? He didn't come back! No choice! Now Go! [distant gunfire] Eastern Brigade, are you there? Bugger. Hello Eastern Brigade are you there? Sir, I can't get through to the Eastern Brigade. The line seems to be down. I can't get through. Patch me through using the Western Brigades lines. No, no, no, sir... they don't have a switchboard. Isn't there anyone in the Western District that has a working telephone switchboard? Hmm... The Royal... The Royal Hotel might have one. If we are lucky their lines may be working and we can get through to our boys in the East. Alright, alright, get those lines going again! Yes sir. [Christmas music playing] Christmas Eve. I guess it was too much to hope that we could have this evening off. Just as well. The war has closed down all the restaurants. Well, I baked you some cookies for tonight. Chocolate chip, your favourite. Man, I am starving right now. We better make our escape to the Peak tonight. When? 9 PM. Also don't forget to bring your Christmas present. OK... Oh, and I found that letter for that young Canadian Tom. Good, he will be very happy to get it. Winnipeg, Canada? I have never heard of Winnipeg. Me neither, probably a very cold place in the winter. [phone rings] Hello, Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? Yes sir... understand sir. I am trying to patch you through to the main line to Repulse Bay. Hold on, sir. I am trying to patch you to the Eastern Brigade. [phone rings] Is this Eastern Brigade? Good, connecting to you now sir. What's happening? Yes sir. Understand, sir. Thank you sir. Thank you. What's happening? The Eastern District has lost all connections, and they need to patch through my switchboard as I am the only one who still has connection to the Repulse Bay main trunk line. Oh my God! That means the Japanese are just a couple miles away! [music] I see something! 4 o'clock, heading West. Four, maybe five soldiers half way up Chi Pak Hill. You better call it in, see if they might be British. Patch me through to operations. Eastern quadrant. Liverpool reporting, four to five soldiers heading up Chi Pak Hill. Do we have any boys in this quadrant? OK, thanks for the confirmation. Yeah, they are one of our guys, protecting the reservoir over there. Bloody Christ, how are we supposed to fight. We can't even see the damn enemy! Stay alert guys. It's the enemy you never see that's the most dangerous. Just give me a visual. I will nail a few of those bastards in the balls. [music] [gunshot] Jesus! Monty! Monty! [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [moaning] Hello? Hello? This is recon Liverpool, can anybody hear me? Hello! This is recon Liverpool, can anybody hear me? Hello? Anybody there? Can you speak up please? Lily, can you grab the headset over there? I can't hear what he is talking about. See if you can hear anything. His voice is very faint. I am going to attend to other calls. Hello? This is the switchboard, can I help you? This is recon Liverpool, can anybody hear me? Hello? Yes, Yes, I can hear you, but you are very faint. This is the Royal Hotel switchboard. Tom! It's that young Canadian soldier Tom. Yes, yes, I can hear you a bit better now. You are breathing strange. Are you hurt? I have been shot. [distant gunfire and artillery] A letter? From my wife? Yes, read it to me. My dearest Tom, I wonder what your days are like, Hong Kong is so far away. I have written each week, but I wonder if my letters reach you. The mail service to Asia is dreadfully slow. Each day I spring open the mailbox, but so far nothing from you. I wonder, does the mail reach Asia from the East or the West? I do feel lonely not having you around the house. And the thought of Christmas without you is dreadful. Please, please stay safe darling. Oh... I have some good news. You are going to be a father. I went to the doctor yesterday and he told me that I am two months pregnant. We are going to have our own little family. A father? I am going to be a father? [crying] Tom? Tom are you there? Tom? Yeah, yeah... I am here. Lily... Lily, I am not going to make it. I am bleeding too badly. [moaning] I need you to do something for me. I need you to write a letter... to my wife Emma. Tell her... Tell her that I am so happy... about the news of our future child. [painful moaning] And tell her that I love her... That I miss her... [painful moaning] Tell her what happen here, so she knows... OK? Yes, I can write the letter. OK. What's that? Is that Christmas music? Yes, we have the radio playing. [painful moaning] I am getting dizzy... It is getting hard to focus... Could you turn it up for me? Ok, Tom, here it is... [music "Auld Lang Syne" playing] This map! Where did you get it? You are running out of time. The city is falling to the Japanese. Soon you will be in an internment camp or your grave. Bull shit! Who is your contact? Lieutenant-General T. Sakai, Commander of the 23rd Japanese Army. Maybe you should talk to him? Oh... almost forgot, most of your communication lines have been cut. Pity... So it was your group of saboteurs cutting those lines? Most of them. Except for the ones leading to the Royal Hotel. But the Japanese already know to attack that location too. You British have always been one step behind. Send some men to the Royal Hotel, get that switchboard room secured! And warn the hotel. I will deal with you later. Your arrogance has made you blind! [laughing] The lines are going down all over the city. Can you patch me through to the Royal Hotel please? The Royal Hotel, yes, correct. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello, Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? [phone ringing] Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? [phone ringing] Hello Royal Hotel, how may I place your call? Yes, good... I am connecting you now sir. [gunfire] Gunshot in the hotel? Bowie! Wake up! Lily... Lily we must go! Lily! The Japanese could be coming back any moment. We have to go! Ok? Sorry! He is gone. [explosions] Come on Lily, we have to hurry. The Japanese could be coming at any moment. This is my office. We should be safe here for a while. The Japanese have taken over half the island already. It's only a matter of time before Hong Kong falls completely under their rule. We have to head to the Peak tonight. It's safer there. Damn, the batteries are dead. Lily... Let me show you something. I too lost someone, three years ago... We were married eight months, then the war came. You should get cleaned up. There is water and a basin. [water pouring] Come. I am going to go find batteries for the flashlight. But I will be back. [distant gunfire and explosions] [music] [church bell rings in distance] It's Christmas. [distant gunfire and explosions] [music] [distant explosions] [door opens] [distant gunfire] Thank you, Lily. [distant gunfire and explosions] [air raid siren] [wind blowing] This morning, another group of 14 Canadian soldiers arrived in Winnipeg, after completing their overseas military service. It was a joyous occasion as they stepped off the plane to meet with their friends and family. Now to other news from around the country. With the war over, the Canadian economy is now booming. Canadian exports of wheat, oil and other commodities are in great demand overseas. A continued rise of stocks on the Toronto Stock Exchange... [car horn] Oh, the mailman is here. Can you stay here and wait for me? Yes. Let me see. Is it the mailman? Yes, mailman. Can I see. You wait right here, I am going to get the mail. [music] [end credit music]
