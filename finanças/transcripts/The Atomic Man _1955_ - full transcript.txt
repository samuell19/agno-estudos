(dramatic music) (dramatic drum music) (gun firing) (gun fires) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (bell ringing) When did you find this man? 9:33 exactly. (speaking drowned out by car screeching) Find any weapon? No, sir. I'll give it another fine look over in the morning. There's nothing else I can do here, goodnight. What's the story? What's it look like to you? Looks like you caught a fish. (officers chattering) Here, sir. I want some pictures. Very good, sir. And who the devil are you? McCray, prime coverage from View Magazine. You'll be covering a bench in a police cell if you take anymore pictures without our permission. Signed by the Commissioner. Special Series, London Police in Action. (dramatic music) He's not dead, but he's barely alive. Catalepsy. More likely an injury to the central nervous system. Heart and lung action practically nonexistent. Which explains why he didn't drown. Anyway, the first thing we've got to do is to get that bullet out of him. Right. Immediate surgery. Hello, Jack. You got no respect for a man's stomach at all. I was right in the middle of a good dinner. In here. All right. Dr. Preston, this is Detective Inspector Cleary of Scotland Yard. How do you do? Good evening. Can you tell us anything about this man? Nothing except he's got a bullet in his back. Is he going to live? I don't think so, but we'll do the best we can. Sister. Number three theater. Yes, sir. Anything on him? No, not a thing. Just another body. (dramatic music) Yeah, very good. You got some good stuff here, Mac. Make a darn good series. Hi, Chief. Hi Mac, how's the crime business? Dirty. That's why the public likes it. How's our science writer these days? In need of a holiday. How 'bout it, Chief? You, Mr. Delaney, will be at Stevenage at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow to get a story about the opening of a new maternity clinic. Maternity clinic. Here's some dope. The photographer will meet you outside the hospital. They open hospitals every day. It's all they do is cut the tape. And when the cut that tape, Delaney, (phone ringing) you'll be there. Hello. You have to learn to take the rough with the smooth, Delaney. After all, such are the tribulations of journalism. That's what they tell me. It's for you, Einstein. Thank you. Hello? Delaney? Oh hi, baby. Yeah, I know I said 10 minutes, but-- That was half an hour ago. Since then, I've had four tomato juice cocktails, worked my way through two plates of salted peanuts, and I'm in a very ugly mood. (Delaney chuckling) Rabowski, I love you when you get mad. I've got mad I haven't even used yet. Hey Mac, who's this? Oh, some muck they fished out of the river. When? Couple hours ago. Dead? Pretty nearly. Why is the print all fuzzy? Oh, I don't know, leak in the camera, I guess. Delaney, I'm still here, remember? I hear you, baby. Where'd they take him? Northern District Hospital. Delaney! Yes, baby, I'm with you. Mind if I borrow this? No, bring it back though. Sure. Oh baby, look, I'll meet you in five minutes. I've got to go down to the photo library and check something. If you mean that blonde number, I've already checked. She's married and has two children. (Delaney chuckling) She has three, but who's counting? All right, five minutes. Okay baby, bye. I don't know how that dame puts up with you. Must be my irresistible charm. I can resist it, Delaney. (tense music) Hi, sunshine. Hello, Mr. Delaney. Can I get you anything? Like excited? Oh, Mr. Delaney. Hey sunshine, are you married? No. Any children? Oh, Mr. Delaney. (giggles) Oh yes, of course. (suspenseful music) (heart beating) The heart stopped. Adrenaline, quickly. We better clean up. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Get Dr. Preston! (heart beating) Dr. Preston! What's the matter? His heart's beating again, it's incredible. Incredible enough he's still alive! Nurse have those clips ready. Don't worry about that, get the suction pump going. (dramatic music) Delaney. Hi, sweetie, where ya been? Where have I been? That does it. If I ever speak to you again, it'll be strictly in the line of business. What? Hey, Rabowski, wait a minute. I've been waiting for the past 20 minutes. Did I ever tell you you're the most attractive photographer in the business? Flattery will get you no place. Well, why don't we just take the day off sometime and get married? You say the sweetest things, don't you? Hi. Hi. Don't I though? Hey, look at this. So? They dragged this guy out of the river tonight more dead than alive, identity unknown. Well? Well, when Delaney saw this picture, he started to think. Bully for you. Where, I ask myself, have I seen this mug before? And how did you answer yourself? Hi. Hi. Look. Stephen Grant Rayner, nuclear physicist. Former Director of Metalury for the Atomic Commission in America. Now in Britain working at the Brant Nuclear Research Institute. In America, among American scientists, this guy is known as the Isotope Man. Do you think that's the same man? Well look, what do you think? Well, what on Earth would he be doing in the river? Taking a bath, darling. Come on, we got work to do. No, I don't do a bit of work until I've had something to eat. I'm hungry! The trouble with you, Rabowski, is you lack the spirit of journalism. We'll get a sandwich on the way, come on, come on. Wow, I've seen clinical death before but never quite like that. How is he? He's perfectly all right. On any other occasion, I'd say it'd been a completely successful operation. Peculiar. Peculiar, it's positively uncanny. Yes Doctor, yes I'll tell him. Yes? Never mind. Good evening, my name's Delaney. Yes? I hear you fished a man out of the river tonight. Yes, what about it? Have you identified him yet? Not yet, why? That's him. Stephen Rayner! We're putting him in the isolation room in Ward C, Doctor. All right, Sister, I'll be up in a minute. Very good, Doctor. Well, you learn something every day, don't you? Yes. I better do the rounds, see you later. All right. Where did you get this information? Out of our files. And the name of your magazine? View Magazine. Oh, I see. Have you told anyone else about all this? Nope. I want an exclusive. I give you the information, you give me the story. Oh. By the way, how is he? It's not a murder case just yet, if that's what you mean, Mr. Delaney. Will, get in touch with the office, see if they can find Rayner's last address. Ask why he hasn't been reported missing, and if you no luck there, you better try this Brant Research Institute. Very well, Inspector. Don't you believe he's Rayner? Mr. Delaney, I never believe anything until I'm able to check it. Oh, excuse me. Doctor, how is he? He's all right. Dr. Preston, this is Mr. Delaney of View Magazine. Hello, Doctor. Delaney, I've read some of your articles. Very interesting. Thank you. And this is Miss-- Jill Rabowski. How do you do? If Mr. Delaney's right, Doctor, you've got a most important patient on your hand. Oh? Stephen Rayner. The physicist? But that's not possible. That's what I think. Let me see him now. He's unconscious, but you can see him if you like. I'll take you up. Well thank you for your help, Mr. Delaney. Are you kidding? I though we had a deal. If anything happens, we'll let you know know. No, but. Well, you're the last cop I'll ever give any information to. You just think of me when you get that extra stripe, Inspector. Oh, that flatfooted-- Delaney, that's no way to talk to a policeman. Come on. No. I'm hungry, I'm dying, I'm starving, I want to eat. Food, food, that's all you think about. I'm a growing girl. Well, stop growing, come on. Looks a lot better now than he did when we fished him out of the river. We thought he was dead. He did die. Hey, psst. There's your shot. Line it up. Oh, no. All set? Mm-hmm. We call it clinical death. Oh. Only in this case, there were two unusual factors. I say, anyone for tennis? (camera clicks) Thank you very much. Out! Hey, you-- Never mind, forget it. Let him have his picture. Journalists are like dandruff, you finally give up trying to get them out of your hair. You know, something tells me we're onto a big story here. Something tells me we're gonna wind up in jail. Thank you very much, goodbye. Well, did you find Rayner? You know, Mr. Delaney, you're like a lot of journalists. You just don't believe anything that isn't a big mystery. For your information, I've just been speaking to Dr. Rayner and apart from a slight head cold he's very much alive. Goodnight, Mr. Delaney. Goodnight, Miss. Well, do we eat now? I don't get it. Come on, let's eat. "Let's eat," he says. (disappointed music) Well, there's nothing much we can do tonight. If he comes around, get in touch with me at the Yard, will you? All right. That's not Rayner. You sure? I just talked to him on the phone. Oh, I didn't think much of that theory anyway. Well, I must get back to my dinner. Goodnight, Doctor. Goodnight. Goodnight. I'll be downstairs. (tense music) Well, it certainly looks like Rayner, but I can assure you, it isn't. As a matter of fact, he's right here in the laboratory at this moment. We know that, but there's such a striking resemblance, we thought we better make sure. Oh, you think he might have a twin brother or something like that. Well, you never know. Put me through to Dr. Rayner, will you? (intercom buzzing) Yes? Mr. Delaney is here, sir. Delaney? Send him in, will you? Yes, sir. What's he doing here? Same as you I imagine. Oh, Steve, Bob. Can you come down to my office for a few minutes, please? Yes, it is rather important. Well, you can leave that to Richards, can't you? All right. Mr. Delaney, sir. Hi Bob, how are you? Hi Mike, you in on this too? In on it, I started it, remember? Oh Mike, this is Inspector-- Yeah, yeah, I know, we've met. How did you get in here, Delaney? Same as you, through the front gate. Come to think of it, what are you doing here? I thought you hadn't bought my theory on Rayner? I haven't, I'm just down to make sure. You never met Rayner, did you Mike? No, he's an American, isn't he? Yes. Wasn't he working on some scheme to actually create elements in the laboratory? That's right. Is that what he's doing here. Mm-hmm. Isn't that what the alchemist used to call transmutation? Yes. Well, I'm not much of a scientist, but I should've thought that couldn't possibly be done. Well, Rayner succeeded, not in a big way, of course, but he did it. Well, what element has he managed to create in the lab? Well, I'm afraid I can't tell you that. But one thing I can tell you, if we do succeed here in producing this element in large enough quantities, then it's going to have a profound effect on the economy of the entire civilized world. That's probably the most ominous statement of the week. May I quote you? You may not. Oh come in, Steve. Dr. Rayner, this is Inspector Cleary of Scotland Yard. How do you do? Morning. This is Sergeant Hayes. Good morning, Sir. And Mr. Delaney. How do you do? Delaney writes for View Magazine, you've probably read his articles on atomic energy. No, I'm afraid I haven't. Probably kid stuff for you, Doctor. Well, what's this all about, I'm pretty busy. I know, Doctor, and this may sound like a terrible waste of your time, but last night we pulled a man out of the river, he'd been shot. He was more dead than alive. We haven't been able to identify him, but we thought if you had a look at this photograph, you may understand why we're here. You must admit, it's very like you. Yes, remarkable. Yes, of course it obviously isn't you, but we thought if we talked to you, you might have some ideas. It occurred to me, Doctor, if you have a double, well, you may know about it. It certainly is an incredible likeness, but no one I know. What about this man, is he still alive? Yes, he is. Well, if that's all. Well, thank you very much, Doctor. Did you have an accident, Doctor Rayner? Oh yes, I had a bump with my car on Sunday. Truck ran into the back of me and pushed me through the windscreen. Well, I've gotta get back. You're working on some pretty top-secret stuff here, aren't you, Doctor? Very top secret, Mr, uh-- Delaney. Base metal into gold? Something even more useful than gold, Mr. Delaney. How's it going, Steve? Think you'll be ready for tomorrow? Yeah, we'll be ready. Well, good day. Good day. What's happening tomorrow? We're making our final tests tomorrow, so it's going to be a very important day for all of us. Well, Mr. Maitland, you must have a lot of work to do. Well, I'm sorry I haven't been able to help you, Inspector. That's quite all right. Goodbye. Good day. Inspector? Yes? Have you ever been bumped in the back by a car? No, why? Well, the impact would throw you backwards not forwards. You wouldn't hit your head on the windshield at all. Listen to me, you better leave the Sherlock Holmes stuff to us, huh? Goodbye, Mr. Maitland. All right. Good morning. Good morning. Let's face it, Mike, you ought to stick to writing science articles. I guess so. Holy smoke! What's the matter? You may be looking at the ex-science writer of View Magazine. I'll be back for a job. Thanks a million, Bob. (Bob laughing) Then where the devil is he? I don't know, Mr. Alcott, maybe he met with an accident. He'll meet with an accident when I get my hands on him. Okay, grab some pictures and get back here. Yes, sir. Yes, Mr. Alcott. Get Delaney. He's not in the office, Mr. Alcott. Well, when he shows up, send him in here. Oh, Mr. Delaney. Yeah? Mr. Alcott wants to see you. Okay. (keys clacking) Delaney. I know. Mr. Alcott wants to see you. Mr. Alcott wants to see me. Mm-hmm. I've printed out that shot we took. Let me see. What's wrong with your camera? Nothing's wrong with my camera. Well look, it's all fogged up. What if this was the picture scoop of the year? The assassination of an Archduke or something? You must have loaded the film wrong. I've been loading film since I was knee-high to a tripod. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I don't know who this character is, but it isn't Rayner. Oh? (people chattering) I went out to Brant this morning. There was Dr. Rayner, happy as a sandboy playing with his cycle top. Let's face it, Delaney goofed again. Hi. Hi. Here, Delaney. Mr. Delaney to you. Old waffle face is in one of his ulcer moods again. You better get in there right away. Okay. You know the trouble with our boss? He won't be happy till he's given his ulcers to everybody in the office. All you ever here around here is, "Yes, Mr. Alcott. "Ooh, but of course, Mr. Alcott. "No, Mr. Alcott." (Delaney knocking) Come in! Yes, Mr. Alcott. But you say this man in the hospital isn't Rayner? Well, not exactly, but you see-- Delaney, this magazine already has a crime reporter. You are paid heavens knows why to write articles on science. Well sure, Chief-- You'll go this afternoon to the Stevenage Maternity Clinic, you'll interview the mothers, and you'll make goo faces at the babies. And I expect your copy in here by six o'clock. Okay. Take Miss Rabowski with you and tell her to get color shots. All right. And Delaney? Yes, sir? The Stevenage Maternity Clinic is one of the most advanced clinics in the country. It's news. I should hate you not to be there. Don't worry, Chief. But I do worry, I worry very much. You shouldn't do that, it's bad for your ulcer. And leave my ulcer out of this! Yes, sir. (Alcott sighs) Sorry I took so long. That's okay. Are you still looking at those things? Mm-hmm. You know that picture of the fellow they pulled out of the river? Yeah. It was fogged up like this too. It doesn't look like ordinary fogging though. Delaney, hadn't we better get out to Stevenage. Mm-hmm. Oh look, don't think I don't admire you enthusiasm. Of course it would be wonderful if you wrote a good scoop. But honey, there's an old journalistic saying that goes, "Before the jam, the bread and butter. "And before the bread and." Delaney, this car is heading south and Stevenage is due north. There's another old journalistic saying, honey. "If you got a hunch, follow it up." Baby, I've got a hunch. But the boss will blow a gasket if we don't cover this story. All right, move over on that bread line, Jack. Make room for two more. (patient panting) (patient groaning) Sister. Pulse and temperature are pretty normal, Doctor. He seems to be very disturbed mentally. Can't make any sense out of him at all. Mm-hmm. Seems a little quieter now. What is it? Are you in pain? I, I don't seem to remember, I, I. Can you tell me your name? Here. Here, just here. Your head hurts, does it? All right, let's take it easy. I think we better have his head x-rayed. There may be some injury to the brain. I'll arrange it at once, Doctor. (tense music) Dr. Preston's patient. Oh yes, on here, please. With the head at this end. (machine clacking) What's the matter? Are there any isotopes in here? No, shouldn't be. All the stock isotopes were taken down to the basement this morning. Why, what's wrong? Well, there's some radioactivity in here. Look. Hmm. There must be some contamination around. Anyway, let's get on with his x-rays. We'll check on that afterwords. Keep your head quite still. Right. (machine whirs) What's the trouble? We're picking up some radioactivity, yet there's nothing to cause it as far as we can see. Let's have a look. Nothing registering here. Well, it was just now. It was flashing like a mad thing. That's very odd. (tense music) Well Bob, what do you think? Well, it doesn't look like a fault in the camera. Might be a blemish in the film stock. All the other shots on that roll were all right. Hmm. Well, the only other thing it could be, but that's not very likely, is it? What's that? Well, some outside contamination of the film. Like static electricity or some form of radiation. You mean something radioactive? Yes, that would produce this sort of effect. Maybe there was some radium in the room at the time? Or a radioactive man. Someone they call the Isotope Man. You mean Rayner? Yep. Bob, what are the symptoms of radiation poisoning? Aplastic anemia. Now, that's the destruction of the red blood cells, isn't it? Yes. What else? Fatigue, sickness, nervous exhaustion, damage to the nerve fibers, and probably most important, a possible effect on the tissues of the brain. (dramatic music) Well yes, the patient certainly has all the symptoms you describe, Mr. Delaney, and he could be suffering from radiation poisoning. On the other hand, he could be suffering from any of a dozen other diseases. Too many things check out, Dr. Preston. The fact that this guy looks like Rayner. The fact that Rayner's been working around radioactive materials for years. And these photographs. If you're so convinced that your theory is correct, why come to me? Why not go to the police? Or am I right in assuming that you may not receive a very warm reception in that direction? Look Doc, I know that guy upstairs is Rayner. And the police tell me this afternoon he was not. If I could just talk to him for a minute. I'm sorry, Mr. Delaney. Come on, Delaney, Dr. Preston's a very busy man. Doc look, just let me talk to him. It would just be a waste of time. Besides, he's in a traumatic condition, quite incoherent. We haven't been able to make sense of anything he says. So, why don't we ask him if he's Stephen Rayner. Just like that, point blank. "Are you Stephen Rayner?" Maybe that'll knock him out of his traumatic condition. Mm, if this man did turn out to be Stephen Rayner-- It'll be the most sensational story of all time. If this guy's Stephen Rayner, what's he doing here? How did he come to get shot? Who shot him, and why? All right. (light knocking) Staff reports, Dr. Preston. Oh, just put them on my desk, will you? Of course, if what you say turns out to be right, I shall have to inform the police at once. All right. And I'm afraid the young lady-- No, that's all right, I'll wait in the car. (suspenseful music) Dr. Rayner? Dr. Stephen Rayner? What's the matter with you? Of course I do. Can't you understand what I'm saying? Why does everyone have to keep talking in circles? Listen, I don't remember, I tell you I don't remember anything. Can you tell us anything at all about yourself? He sounds like he's talking sense, but he doesn't seem to hear what you're saying. How about if I talk to him? All right. Who shot you, Rayner? Yeah, that's right. Somebody tried to kill you didn't they? Vasquo. Vasquo, who's Vasquo? I'm trying to, but you keep talking in circles! Look, just listen, just listen-- UTC. UTC, what's that? What's UTC, and who's Vasquo? Could I have a glass of water please? This isn't really getting us anywhere, is it? Sure isn't. All right then. He better get some sleep. (dramatic music) Now you see what we're up against. Yeah. Have you tried shock treatments? ECT and insulin, no effect. Excuse me. Yes, Miss Crane? I was wondering if I could speak to you for a moment Dr. Preston. Of course, I'll be in in a minute. All right. That guy's Rayner, I know it. I'm gonna prove it if I have to-- Have to what, Mr. Delaney? I welcome any good suggestions. Thanks, Doc, good night. Goodnight. What is it? It's these x-rays. Your patient in C ward. Oh yes, what about him? Well, we thought we had trouble with the equipment, but the engineers checked it and it's perfectly all right. So? Well, see for yourself. There's nothing on it, nothing at all. We just can't x-ray the patient. (dramatic music) (Delaney sighs) Well, they know? I don't know. Well, did you talk to him? I've had better conversations with horses before now. The guy is loony, he snapped his cap. You haven't given up though, have you? All right, suppose the man in there is Rayner, then who is the other person out at the Brandt Institute? You say he looks like Rayner. Everybody accepts him as Rayner. He's doing Rayner's work. Oh, sure. Yet you think he's an imposter. I don't know what to think. All I know, there's something screwy somewhere. Well, you can say that again. Oh look, Delaney, I love you, but I'm beginning to think you're a little nutty myself. You have a good job, remember? If the boss doesn't throw us both out when we get back, I'll be very surprised, and I seem to remember some talk about our getting married. Does the name Vasquo ring a bell with you? No, it doesn't. The way things are going, you won't even have the money to buy a license. UTC, what do you think that means? I wish now I'd married Joe Hockenheimer. You know, Joe who? Joe Hockenheimer. (Delaney laughs) You kidding? No, I'm not kidding. Joe was a very nice boy. He had a steady job and he was very much in love with me. So, why didn't you marry him? He didn't ask me. Well, now where are we going? Gonna see Rayner. Oh Delaney, please. You know how it is in my profession, Dr. Rayner. Can't let a good story slip through your fingers. For my money, this is a good story. Unknown man found shot, dead image of famous scientist. So, we're here to interview the famous scientist. How do you know where I lived anyway? You're in the phone book. You know, Dr. Rayner, if they fished a guy out of the river that was a spitting image of me, I'd be real curious. Maybe, but I have more important things to think of. Oh yes, that experiment you're doing out of Brandt. Creating rare metals in the laboratory, isn't it? Something like that. Weren't you working on a similar theory at Columbia University in 1949? Yes, yes I was. Pretty important discovery if it comes off, eh? Very important discovery. Dr. Rayner? (camera clicks) Thank you. Do you usually take photographs without permission? Why, have you any objections? No, no, of course not. (loud knocking) Yes? There's some gentlemen waiting to see you, sir. All right, thank you. You must excuse me, but I have some visitors. Well, maybe we can pick this up some other time. I'm afraid not, my time's too valuable to be taken up with press interviews. I would appreciate it very much if in future, you would arrange any further interviews through the press office at the institute. That is the usual procedure, you know. Oh yeah, I'll try to remember that. Goodnight, Doctor, thank you. Goodnight. Goodnight. (tense music) Well, who was it? Oh, some journalist. A journalist, what was his name? Delaney, of View Magazine. Delaney. So, are we any the wiser? Look, that wasn't Rayner, that's for sure. Oh? Yeah, I asked him if he was at Columbia University in 1949, he said he was. In 1949, Stephen Rayner was in the South Pacific blowing up A-bombs. And if these pictures come out all right with no fogging? We got him. But he looks so much like Rayner, how do you account for that? Notice those scars on his face and the bruises under his eyes? Yes. He said he was in a crash. But do you know what I think? What do you think? For some reason, the real Rayner had to be gotten rid of. And a phony put in his place. Now, question. Which would be easier to find, a broken down scientist that could take Rayner's place in the lab, or a guy who looks like Rayner but doesn't know a test tube from a Bunsen burner? A broken down scientist. Correct. So, they got a broken down scientist, but he still doesn't look like Rayner. So, what do they do? I give up. Plastic surgery. Oh Delaney, you're wonderful. Yeah, I think so. (tense music) You know, in all my years as a legitimate surgeon, I never did such a good job. It's a pity you were in such a hurry, Vasquo. Couple of weeks more and these scars would have disappeared. Couple more weeks would have been too late. Sooner this thing is over the better I'll like it. Then we'll have the little job of putting your face back where it was. Get this character out of here, he's giving me the creeps. Don't talk to me as if I were some cheap quack! I was one of the finest surgeons in Europe. When I did an operation, the theater would be crowded. Doctors from all over the world. These are great hands, skillful hands. Look at them. Barely able to pick up a bottle, let alone a knife. How I hate failures. How I hate fat dagos who talk too much. You call me a dago again and I'll. You need me, Vasquo. You need both of us. Crummy failures we may be, but you need us. Well said, my friend, well said. The company is paying us a great deal of money for this. The company can afford it. When is the test going to take place? Tomorrow. And is everything ready? Yeah. No mistakes, you understand? No slip-ups! When they switch on that reactor, there will be an explosion which will wipe out Brandt Laboratory and everyone in it. What a ghastly thought. Is it really worth it, I wonder? $100 million empire is at stake, Dr. Bressler. Is that not worth fighting for? I don't know. I never had $100 million empire. (dramatic music) No fogging. So, he's not radioactive. So, he isn't Rayner either. Then who is he? I don't know. I got a feeling he's a small cog in a big wheel. No, my money's on a guy who carries a very fancy walking stick, wears a black South American homburg with the initials E.V. in it. E.V. You mean Vasquo. Why not? Hello, hello, what's going on here, I wouldn't be surprised. What do you want, horrible? You are hereby summoned to the Royal Execution Chamber, PDQ. Okay. Oh, old waffle face is real mad at you, Delaney. I wouldn't want to be in your shoes, I really wouldn't. Look, do me a favor, why don't you run upstairs, see how far you can lean out the window, huh? Ha ha ha. You better go in there. Don't worry about me, I can take care of the boss. Sure and I'll give him a touch of the old Blarney. I'm sick and tired of it, this is the last time. But this is a great story. I don't give a darn about your story. Every time I send you on an assignment, you go and do it lousy. Now, get out of here! All right, all right, all right! (keys clacking) (people chattering) Well, did you give him a touch of the old Blarney? Yeah, I did. What did he give you? Come on, let's get a drink. You forget, I still work here. Yeah. Well, I'll meet you at the bar across the street. Okay. Hey listen, could you get me the office tape recorder? What for? Just an idea I have. How do I get it out? Maybe you can smuggle it out. Like under my coat, for example? Well do what you can, huh? I thought I told you to get out of here. You'll be sorry, Mr. Alcott, real sorry, because I've got the greatest story that ever happened. You are paid to write stories you're told to write. Now, get out of here before I burst a blood vessel and bleed all over you! Okay, okay, I can take a hint. But I'll be back, Mr. Alcott. Delaney will return! Over my dead body! Well, that's a very pleasant way to travel. Well, so long everybody! Don't think it hasn't been fun 'cause it hasn't! (dramatic music) (disappointed music) What'll it be this time? Vasquo. What kind of a drink is that? Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry, Pat, another beer, huh? (patrons chattering) (tense music) Hello. Hello. Yes? We have a little job to do tonight. Be here about 10. And bring the car. Right. International Radio. Hello, this is Embassy 3234. I wish to make a call to Buenos Aires, person to person, to Senior Jose Enriques. (speaking in foreign language) (patrons chattering) Hi. Hi. How are things in the ranks of the unemployed? Chilly. Here's your tape recorder. Oh, that's my girl. Good evening, miss. Good evening, Pat, tomato juice please. Yes, miss. Oh, and Dr. Preston called. Oh, what did he want? I don't know, he just said to call him. Pat, can I use the phone? Yes, sir. By the way, I had a look through the British company's directory. What for? UTC, it sounded like it might be a company. Hmm, you're improving, Rabowski. Dr. Preston please, Delaney. There's Universal Traction Company in Sheffield, makes farm equipment. What else? Well, there's the Uxbridge Tennis Club. No. Dr. Preston. Occurred, which might possibly bear out your theory about this patient we've got here. Oh, what happened? Well, what do you know? Dr. Preston, I have a tape recorder here, and I thought if we could get a recording of his voice? Okay, I'll be right over. What is it? They took some x-ray pictures of that guy. And they were fogged? Fogged? They didn't even come out, the guy's a living A-bomb, Pat, will you take care of that stuff for me? Okay. I think I'll buy myself a pair of roller skates. The whole thing's medically astounding. We've checked him for radiation and found him to be contaminated to a point round 6,000 counts per minute. Holy smokes. That's enough to kill most men. Well, maybe he's developed a resistance against it. He's been around atomic pile's a long time, you know? We're giving him zirconium to counteract radiation poisoning. Any improvement? Physically, yes, but-- All set. I don't think this is gonna get you very far. He'll be just as incoherent as he was yesterday, you know. I suppose so. But I've got a feeling there's a method in this guy's madness. Ready? Yes. I'm afraid we're going to ask you some more questions. No. I can't. I try to. But I can't. Can't what? Look, can you remember anything at all? Stephen Rayner. Stephen Rayner, doesn't that name mean anything to you? Look, we've been through all this before. I told you about Vasquo. You keep talking about Vasquo. Who is he? Why? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Rayner, why did Vasquo try to kill you? Yes. Some other man. Pushed me in a car. Is there anything else you can remember? You keep asking me questions. I try to answer you. What more do you want? Is there anything else you can remember? You keep asking me questions. I try to answer you. What more do you want? Did you get it all? Yeah. This is all very interesting, Mr. Delaney, but where has it got us? I don't know. I thought maybe something would click somewhere. Hmm. Well, first thing in the morning, I'm going to hand that patient over to psychiatric and let them sort it out. You mean you think he's gone, huh? If you were to die, Mr. Delaney, and then be brought back to life, I don't suppose you'd be exactly compos mentis. How long was he in clinical death? Seven or eight seconds. Stephen Rayner, doesn't that name mean anything to you? Look, we've been through all this before. I told you about Vasquo. I don't want to turn you out, Mr. Delaney, but I have things to do. Perhaps we can talk about this in the morning. Just a little more. You keep talking about Vasquo. Who is he? Why? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. It sounds like-- Like what? Well, I know it sounds crazy, but it sounds like he's answering the questions before he's asked them. Rabowski, you read out the questions, but start with the second question first. Got it? No, but I'll do what I can. I'll fade out the questions on the tape, so we only hear the answers, okay? I don't get it. Anyway, you want me to start here? Right at the beginning, right. All right. Ready? Mm-hmm. I'm afraid we're going to ask you some more questions. Can you remember anything at all? No, I can't. I try to, but I can't. Stephen Rayner, doesn't that name mean anything to you? Stephen Rayner. You keep talking about Vasquo, who is he? Look, we've been through all this before. I told you about Vasquo. Rayner, why did Vasquo try to kill you? Why? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Is there anything else you can remember? Yes. Some other man. Pushed me in a car. Is there anything else you can remember? It's unbelievable. Your patient's ahead of time, Dr. Preston. It's scientifically impossible. Well, apparently it isn't. I'll tell you something else. You said that he was clinically dead for seven or eight seconds, right? Mm-hmm. I just timed him. His answers come exactly 7.5 seconds ahead of the questions. (dramatic music) (Delaney sighs) Pretty strange huh? Creepy's more like it. Yeah. There's still a lot of things that don't add up. Like Vasquo? Like Vasquo. Oh well. Well, that's pretty platonic. Maybe it's because I don't feel very platonic. How do you feel? I'd ask you up, but my landlady sleeps with one ear open. Did I ever tell you I was crazy about you? I knew you were crazy. Hey look, this is every nice, but I'm the one with the job. I have to get up in the morning, remember? Oh. You know, if we were married, we could do this all the time. Uh-huh. Is that all you have to say, uh-huh? Uh-huh. Goodnight. Goodnight. Wait, are you gonna be very busy tomorrow? What do you want me to do? UTC. Oh Delaney, there are over 4,000 reference books in our library. I know, I know. Hey, wait a minute. I must be slipping. South America, of course. Why of course? Vasquo comes from Buenos Aires, at least that's where he bought his hat. I'm supposed to be covering a fashion show tomorrow. I'll do anything for you. I knew you would. (romantic music) Maybe that's because you love me. I never thought of that. Goodnight, genius. Goodnight, darling. (car horn honks) (tense music) (gun firing) (dramatic music) (machines whirring) Good morning, sir. Good morning. D-Day at least, eh Doctor? Yeah. I've checked all the equipment, everything seems to be okay. Good. We had a little trouble though. We couldn't start running the reactor until this morning, I had to do a line fold. I pray that'll mean it won't be warmed up for at least five hours. But we're supposed to go ahead at four o'clock. Well, it won't be until, oh about nine o'clock tonight now. Still, a test of this importance, a couple of hours here or there shouldn't matter much, should it, sir? (eerie music) (dramatic music) (doorbell buzzes) Oh? Good morning. What's going on here? You better come in, Miss. Delaney? Hi. Ooh, take it easy. Sorry. What happened? Go on, Delaney, tell her, we'd like to know too. I had a hunting accident. Is it serious? I've seen worse. You'll live. Look, nobody's told me what's happened yet. Take it easy, baby, it'll be all right. Will you help me with this? Yeah. Can he move around, Doc? As long as he doesn't use that arm too much. Come and see me tomorrow and take it easy. Okay, thanks, Doc. Better get dressed. What's the hurry? Inspector Cleary wants to see you. Darling, are you sure you're all right? Sure, just lost little skin, that's all. Bad shot, those boys. Somebody shot at you? You fellows mind waiting out in the hall? All right. What'd you find out? I think you'll buy this one. Yeah? The United Tungsten Corporation. Uh-huh. Buenos Aires. Ole, ole, ole. Capital $100 million. A tungsten mining monopoly controlling 2/3 of the world's supply of tungsten ore. Tungsten, huh? Mm-hmm. That's what they're making out of Brandt. Synthetic tungsten. If they could make that on a large enough scale, they could put UTC out of business overnight. Their London office is in Dolan Square. I wonder what the stretch is for breaking and entering in this country. Delaney, you're, but you could go to jail for a thing like that! The spirit, Rabowski, remember the spirit. I'm awfully sorry, sir, but we really must be getting along. Right old boy, with you in a jiffy! I'll meet you at Pat's bar at 6:00. Delaney? Yeah. Take care of yourself, will you? Hold this for me til I get back. Mind if I take my car? As long as I ride with you. Oh, pleasure, old chap, pleasure. (tense music) What I want to know is, can the patient be made to talk? According to Dr. Preston here, he's got quite a lot to talk about. The sooner we hear what he's got to say, the better. Even allowing for this time slip business, he still seems unable to remember anything. Well, he's still in a state of amnesia, but I think it's possible to cure that also. (loud knocking) Come in. Well, Mr. Delaney, been playing policeman I hear? Yeah, what have you been playing, Scrabble? Hi, Doc. Dr. Marks, this is Mr. Delaney. Oh, how do you do? How do you do, Doctor? Dr. Marks is a psycho-neurologist. What do you make of the patient, Dr. Marks, all this business being ahead of time. I'm afraid it's easier to understand than it is to explain. But surely, Doctor, the explanation is quite simple. The patient's either psychic or clairvoyant or something like that. No. Because his physical reactions are also ahead of time. I carried out a number of tests on this patient. One of them was to shine light in his eyes. He blinked exactly 7.5 seconds before I turned the light on. Doesn't that have something to do with Dunn's Theory of Time and Space? Yes, I think perhaps it does. Dr. Preston informs me that during the operation, this man died and was brought to life again. He was dead for 7.5 seconds. And now we find that he is ahead of his true position in time by 7.5 seconds. Now, what happened to him during that vital period of time? Well, when he died, when his heart stopped beating, he was no longer moving through time. He had come to a halt. Yet, time was still moving on. Moving on, without him. Now, at this point he was given an injection of adrenaline to restore the action of his heart. But at the very second he was given that injection, he was already 7.5 seconds behind time. Lost 7.5 seconds of his lifeline. The injection was given, the heart began to beat once more, and he was pulled up to his normal position in time. In other words, he was brought back to life again. Well, what I believe happened is this, that when his heart had stopped for a moment, his brain had continued to function, so that in bringing him back to life, in pulling him up to his true position in time, his brain, which had not lost any time at all, was moved forward 7.5 seconds ahead of time, so that his consciousness, his ego, is now just that much ahead of his physical surroundings. But surely, Doctor, when the heart stops beating, the brain ceases to function? Normally, yes, but we're not dealing with a normal patient. This man has been exposed to intense atomic radiation over many years. That's why they call Rayner the Isotope Man. The effect of atomic radiation on the brain cells of human beings is something we do not know much about, but experiments on animals have shown that intense radiation enlarges the brain cells, makes them stronger, better able to resist deterioration. So that they would take longer to die? That's the only conclusion I can come to, that while this man died, his brain continued to live. (loud knocking) Come in. Yes? Dr. Hopkins says, can he have the file on those vaccine tests. Of course, you know where to find it. Yes, Doctor. All right, but how can we make this man talk. Until he tells us what it's all about, we can do nothing. Well, the only thing that Dr. Marks and I think might work is an overdose of a drug called perinin. A large enough quantity will have a sort-of slowing down effect on the brain. Although exactly how to gauge this dose is difficult to say. When could that be done? As soon as you like. Sergeant? Yes, sir? Put a radio call through to the Yard. Get them to send a man down to Brandt. Not to do anything, just to keep an eye on Rayner until we sort things out here. Right. You found that file yet? No Doctor, it doesn't seem to be here. Well, look for it in the morning, will you? Yes, Doctor. Well, I better get off to the dispensary. How much perinin do you want? How many grams are there in 7.5 seconds? Yes, I see what you mean. I'll let you know when the patient's ready. All right. (phone ringing) Hello? Speaking. They're going to give him the injection now. So, they know who he is? They got a pretty good idea. They've already sent someone over to Brandt to watch Jarvis. What ward's Rayner in? All right, now listen. I'm sorry, that sort of thing isn't in my line. If that's what you want done, do it yourself. (dial tone clicking) Don't tell me the great empire is beginning to crumble at last. Rayner mustn't be allowed to talk. Hmm, and who is going to stop him? You are. It's my job to save lives, not to destroy them. Is that what you were doing during the war, Dr. Bressler, saving lives? How many people died from your little experiments, hmm? But then, that's something we don't talk about, isn't it, Doctor? Brandt Institute. Connect me with Dr. Rayner please. (patrons chattering) Pat, may I have another tomato juice please? You wouldn't be driving a car, miss? No. Ah, that's all right then. May I have a telephone too please? One tomato juice, one telephone. Thank you. Look, if you don't know anything, why should somebody take a potshot at you last night? Maybe someone just thinks I know something. Whatever it is I'm supposed to know, I wish I knew what it was I knew. If you know what I mean. (phone ringing) Preston. Yes, he's here. Mr. Delaney. Oh, thank you. Hello. Oh hi, sweetie. Yeah sure, I'm fine. Well, you didn't show up and I got worried. Are you coming? Well no, I'm, I'm sort of tied up right now. Well, should I wait for you? No, you better go on home and I'll come around later. Okay. I love you. I love you, baby. Bye. (cheerful music) (patrons chattering) (loud scraping) Pat? Yes, miss? You wouldn't like to lend me that icepick, would you? This? Just for this evening? For you, miss, anything. Thank you. If you're thinking of murdering someone, there's a much cleaner way than with an icepick. Oh, well if this doesn't work, I'll let you know. I was just giving you friendly advice, miss. Oh. Um, goodnight. Goodnight, miss. (tense music) Taxi! Dolan Square please. Yup. (tense music) (people chattering) (suspenseful music) Doctor Bressler? I'm so sorry. You are Dr. Bressler, aren't you? We've never met, but I've admired your work for many years. Oh, really? I was in the theater when you did your first facial grafting. Yes, Penbrook, 1924. Your technique has yet to be equaled, Herr Doctor. You are very kind. You must excuse me. Dr. Bressler? Did you see where that guy came from just now? Oh, from somewhere up there. Someone you know, Doctor? Yes, he was a Doctor in Europe and Hamburg. What kind of a doctor? A plastic surgeon. Hold it! What's the matter? Delaney, what's the idea? How come this guy looks like the guy at the Brandt Institute? It could be plastic surgery. So, where was that Doctor whatever-his-name-was just now? In here. Well, everything seems all right. What about him? We gave him a light anesthetic. What's in the hypo doc? Perinin. How do you know? Because those were my instructions. Listen, Delaney. You wouldn't be trying to build this into a story for your newspaper would you? All right, go ahead. It'll be quite a story if this guy dies though, won't it, Doc? Cyanide. Rayner's disappeared. He's not at Brandt, he's not home. Right, come with me. Fill another syringe, will you? Thank you. (dramatic music) (heart beating) Get Brandt on the phone. Right. There was a constable on duty here, where is he? I don't know, sir, he-- Where the Devil have you been? Outside, sir, there's been an accident. What happened? He ran in front of a bus. Inspector? Mr. Maitland? Inspector Cleary here. What's this about Rayner? I don't know, we can't find him anywhere. Ready to go ahead in about 25 minutes, sir. Right. Well, we'll just have to make the test without him. Well, if he turns up, will you ring me at the hospital? Thank you. Will you go out to the water at once, Inspector? Yes. Put an alarm through for this man, Rayner, or whatever his name is. How do you feel? A bit dizzy. What happened? Can't you remember? Oh yes. Yes, I. Do you remember who you are? Of course, I can. I'm Stephen Rayner. (dramatic music) I was thrown in the back of this car. There were three of them. Did you see any of them? No, no, I didn't. Where did they take you? I don't know. Some sort of a warehouse, near some docks. Mr. Delaney? Yes. There's a telephone call for you. In here. Thank you. Hello. So, who lacks the spirit of journalism? Oh baby, not now, I'm busy. Yeah, well I've been busy too. You know where I'm speaking from? This is no time for quiz games. Vasquo's office. You're what? You mean you broke in there? Baby, don't you realize-- I could go to jail for this? All right, all right, what did you find out? Only that there's some photographs here of Rayner. (Jill speaking faintly) How do you like me now? You did great, baby. I'll see that you get the Noble Prize for Literature. Now, get out of there before someone comes back. All right, I'll get the pictures and I'll. Jill, hello, Jill! Jill! Jill! So, Vasquo wants to stop you making Tungsten? How does he propose to do it? I don't know. I put the alarm out. Right, we better get out to Brandt. I got a feeling something's gonna happen out there. (phone clicking) Operator, Operator! Yes, sir. What happened? They cleared the line at the other end, sir. Hey, Inspector. What's the matter? Where'd the inspector go? He went to Brandt Institute. Why what's the trouble? Thanks, Doc, I'll see you later. (dramatic music) What's she doing here? Never mind that. Did you fix everything at Brandt? It'll be the last experiment they ever do at that laboratory. What time do they start? Nine o'clock. We'll be well out of it by then. What are you gonna do with her? Why didn't you get rid of her? We will, as soon as we get on the boat. Emergency, which service please? Police. (phone ringing) Scotland Yard. Vasquo? Yes. The boat'll be ready in about 15 minutes, we're fueling up right now. Right. When will you be here? Right away. Good. Just a minute. Yeah? Where are you speaking from? I'm at the wharf now, where do you think I am? Anyway, hurry up, will ya? Right. Wharf. (dramatic music) (ship horn blowing) (dramatic music) (bell ringing) (tense music) (glass clattering) Go and see what's holding them up! (dramatic music) (Vasquo groans) (Delaney grunts) Delaney! (gun fires) (Vasquo grunting) (gun fires) (gun fires) Delaney! (gun firing) You okay? Yeah. (glass clatters) What are we gonna do with these monkeys? Delaney, something's happening at Brandt's tonight, I heard them talking about it. What do you mean? Well, he said something about tonight's experiment being their last. All right, Doc, what about it, huh? He said it was going to happen at nine o'clock. All right, spill it! Come on, let's hear it! All right, we'll find out for ourselves! Come on! Here sweetie, get the car started. (gun firing) All right, inside! (alarm buzzing) All right, stand by. You can start warming up the pile now, and stand by to start up the reactor. Bring in nine four. Nine four in, 3,000. One minute to go, sir. (alarm buzzing) Now, wait here. I don't want to, I-- Don't argue! Wait here. No, not in there! You're crazy! It's five, 15,000. (alarm buzzing) 18,000. (alarm buzzing) 21,000. Stand by to charge the reactor. (alarm buzzing) 25,000. Four seconds to go. 30,000. Two seconds to go. You can't go in there! One second. Wait a minute, hold everything! Stand by. No, no, don't switch on! Switch on! Is this what you're getting so excited about? What is it? There's enough plutonium in there to blow up half of London. Where'd you find it? We found it. All right. Let's go. We're not entirely asleep, Mr. Delaney. I'm sure glad of that. Sorry if we got ahead of you, for once. Oh, don't apologize. We're still aren't we? I'm still here too, Delaney. Rabowski! Or did you expect me to sit out in the car all night long? Baby, I want to tell you you were terrific. And I love you. You do? Mike, do you mind, we're making a very important experiment here. We're making a very important experiment here too. Aren't we baby? (dramatic music)
