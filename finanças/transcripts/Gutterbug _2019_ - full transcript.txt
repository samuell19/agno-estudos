I do have some fucking weed too if you wanna come down and just sorta relax and mellow the fuck out. You wouldn't know it by looking at him, but Raleigh came from some serious money. His parents live in one of those swanky suburbs on the edge of the city and that's where he whipped up his supply, right under their noses. I'm telling you, this is all the best shit you can get around here. Mommy and daddy thought their honor student would be a chemist one day, or maybe a lawyer. Drugs and deaths were what really got him off though. He wanted to be a mortician. I guess that's why he spent all the time in the graveyard. We kept him around because he cut us a deal and made us laugh, but he never had to worry about his next meal or a dry place to sleep. He wasn't one of us. Thanks man, yeah, fuck.

I mostly saw hatred. I hated what I'd become. Fuck you. It wasn't long before I was sick of the dumpster diving, the begging for change, stealing shit. I needed to get a job, something that would give me enough change in my pocket to get a fucking hamburger and a few cold beers. So you have a car? You got a phone number I can reach you at? Is this your first taxi gig? You know ah, ah, um. The fuck does that mean? Either you do or you don't. How 'bout a home address? But it's... Are your license up to date? Not exactly. I don't know it off the top of my head, I just moved into this new place and I think they're doing some rezoning or something like that. I suspect an acquaintance of mine to have stolen it, but I can't prove that and obviously he's not going to admit it if he did steal it, so I can't help you there. I'm crashing with a friend of mine.

I'm not really. I went to church a lot as a kid, I lived in this group home with Jesus freaks. The whole bible thumping, cross facing the toilet kind. Nothing bad ever happened on Sunday so I guess it just kinda stuck with me. What about you, hm? What do you believe? Nothing really. I mean, we weren't religious growing up, my mom was but that's about it. Kid that lived next door to me though, him and his family went to church every Sunday and he ended up getting molested by his priest - or something. - Geez. He didn't tell anyone for years. It was a big deal for a week or two and then nothing, most people, they didn't wanna believe it or they didn't care. I saw it eat him up. Fucking destroyed him, but, they say that happens all the time, priest screwing around with kids and stuff. I don't know, that and a whole bunch of other things made me pretty convince that religion is a scam. Well, this crash is gonna suck. I wish I had a joint to come down with. Maybe I can help out with that. I feel pretty good now though. What about you? - Yeah. - Yeah? Mm-hmm. That night I had it all. Jenny was cool, she was like me. There was this tightness in my chest, some vacancy had been filled. I know that people don't change, but maybe parts of them do. Something changed in me. The highs were always really high, and the lows always really low, but this high felt different. - Nothing? - Oh shit. - You got it. - I did get it. You hear that one before? No. I was just more evil than the devil and greater than God or contradictory terms. - Yes. - Woo. Yes. Yeah. What a lovely time. I'm so proud. How many we got left? I don't know. I gave you one. Yeah, thank you very much for that. Bug? What? Come here. It's Tina's brother. What, the hooker? Oh shit, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I know this kid, he's a fag. Must've been the HIV caught up to him. Shut the fuck up Slim. Well it could've been. It wasn't. Fucking gross. Just, must've took a hit too strong I guess. Could've been anyone. No, no, no, no, no, this kid was a junkie. You didn't fucking know him. Neither did you. His sister hooks and he liked the needle in the cock. Shut the hell up Slim. Could've been anybody. Don't be a baby. Maybe it was a hot dose or something, I don't know. Raleigh said that there was some synthetic shit moving around. No, no, no, that kid was a junkie, he would've died from the needle eventually. If he was a junkie then what are we, huh? I'm not a junkie, you're a junkie. I'll never be a slave to a substance. I like to think of myself as a recreational user. My ass, you're a speed freak. So are you. Well I'm not hooked, I'm just skimming. Besides, those pills you guys get off of Raleigh are way stronger than anything that kid would've been able to shoot up. Yeah, look at that. - Bad ass. - It's pretty good, right? Yeah, not bad. We roasted in the putrid bubble of brick buildings and side walks. The pavement charred my edges. Summer wasn't all bad though, that's when the city came to life. I like to start early to avoid the midday heat. The days blended together, and this one started out just like the rest. Fletcher, what are you doing man? This is glass, you got plastic here, all right? This is glass, plastics go down there, okay? See? Oh, right at the deli, for Christ sakes. Would you look at that. This place stinks. It reminds me of one time I was working for the CIA. They had me in a basement, no windows, one desk, tapping the phone conversations of the families upstairs. They weren't feeding their kids. It was abuse, you know? It'd been months, listening to phone calls. It's patient work, let me tell ya. And my wife, my wife, she was gonna be in the films. Those kids, they were so skinny before the feds came, nearly burnt the house down. My wife, she never wanted any kids. She smells like daisies. Just a few more of these bottles and I'll be punching my ticket home. She's in the films you know? Yep, yep, you said that. Well looks like you're all set Mr. Fletcher. Two 25, you wouldn't be ripping me off now would you Bug? For real man, that's all you had, all right? Plastics go down there, so take the rest of these plastics and go down there. And you might wanna try hitting your spots a little bit earlier all right, there's the Korean dudes I've been seeing around recently, I think they're beating you to the punch, all right? You're a good kid Bug. See you tomorrow. Fathers day at Paul park, early with a couple of home runs in the second inning. Maybe it's going up here in the sixth and now we're all tied up. Is that date right? What, do you live under a rock? Holy shit. It's my fucking birthday today. Congratulations. All right. Can I get one of those whiskey bottles? Nah, the small one. Thanks man. So I look up at the sign and can't fucking believe it, June 18th, today's my 21st birthday. - Hey. - Yes. Happy birthday Bug. - Thanks. - Holy shit dude, you're only 21? Yeah, funny thing is I've been buying booze of that dude for three years. But I blew the last of my cash on this, so I think lunch is gonna have to be on Eddie. Oh man, just think about it dude, 21 years ago on this exact date you are spit out of your mums twat. That's fucking great. - Yeah. - I'm just telling it like it is man. Everybody thinks childbirth is some kind of fucking miracle, you ever fucking see one? It's a brutal, painful, bloody mess. It's worst than a fucking snuff film, all for the sake of having some little bastard around, 24/7, shittin' and crying and chewing on your nipples. That's why I'll never have one. Yeah, people think babies are so pure too. Yeah, like they come from above. When most of the time, they're the result of something absolutely completely fucking meaningless. I mean, my parents, they're not in love, and they probably weren't when they made me. We're the same as every other little scurrying rodent on this skid, and we're here for the same reason, to die. Yeah, and then? And then, and then, and then what? There is no and then, there is no after that, we're born, we fuck, we live, we die, that's it. No, what, do you think plants and fish and bugs and rats and dogs have an afterlife? I mean, they don't. Look, we aren't special, and if we aren't special, animals are fucked, just frankly fucked. The difference between the species is that we're smarter, we are so much smarter, so much smarter that at some point we realized the best way to survive is to convince ourselves that each and every one of us is the most important breathing bastard on a planet filled with unspeakable numbers of breathing... Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch where you're fucking - going ass whole. - Take a shower shit bag. Hey, come say that - to my face. - Oh, you wanna make something out of this, guy, get the fuck out of the car your swid. - Pussy. - What the fuck? Fucking people these days man, Jesus fucking Christ. I mean, look at Tina's brother, right? Someones kid, someones brother obviously, where is he now? Rotting away under a fucking bridge. I mean face it, people don't care if one us lives or dies. Well that is very grim Bug, and spoken like a guy who's tryna off himself. Are you tryna off yourself? No. Well, yeah, kinda, I mean, I was I guess. Come on mother fucker. What? Hey Eddie, you got what I'm lookin' for today? I thought you were gonna quit. These things will kill you you know, I don't want that to happen. Oh, you're so sweet Eddie. You know, one of these days someone's gonna come walking right through that door. I hope she's as cute as you. But I hope she doesn't smoke, those things will kill you you know. I loved to take you on a date sometime Jenny, you could come over my house, my mom makes really good beef stew. That sounds so nice Eddie, but you know I'm kinda with Bug now, right? He could come too, not Slim though, 'cause he's a piece of shit. Hey Eddie, how's it going man? Fine thanks, what are you guys get in to today? It's Bug's birthday today. Oh, happy birthday Bug. You know, you share the same birthday as my cousin Mark, he's a real piece of shit though. Anyway, I got a little something for you. You know, being your birthday and all. One in four million odds to win the jackpot on that thing. If it's a winner, don't forget who gave you this. Okay Bug? Who gave what to me Eddie? I'm just kidding with you man, and thanks, this is great. Hey Eddie, how 'bout one for me? Go to hell Slim. I'm all ready there my dude. You know, if you died, I'd care. If you were cold and alone something, I'd go to sleep. Hi. Fucking dopey fucking, you stupid. Get the fuck back here. Fuck you. God damn it, I'm gonna fucking kill you. Gonna hit you so fucking hard your hair's gonna grow back. Picking out a tombstone for yourself? Very funny. Thought you would've offed yourself by now, coward. Where's my gun? I hid it. Where? Somewhere safe. It's in a safe place. Well what happened, jam up on you or something? No, it's just, unforeseen circumstances. Jenny? Yeah, you know her? Everyone knows her. Listen man, I'm gonna save you some heartache here all right, she's just well known. Fuck off. She's in for the dope man. Just be careful, that's all I'm saying. Speaking of dope. Yes? Well, do you have any or not? Real shit or the Korean Tic Tac's you sold me last time? You'll feel like you died and went to heaven. This is brand new shit, straight pharmaceuticals, uncut, it's called Dilaudid, even stronger than Oxies. Got ya. Hey Raleigh. Hey Jen. It's Bug's birthday today. No shit, happy birthday you son of a bitch. Let's celebrate. Oh, fuck yes. We are broke though. Course you are. Although in light of a special someones very special day, maybe you could hook us up. Pretty please? Only if I get to pop off with you dweebs. Of course. Yes, thank you very much. To Bug's birthday. To Bug's birthday.

It's awesome. What were they like? Who? Your parents. You said they were in love. How did you know? One time I ditched school, came home early. I didn't expect my dad to be there, his car wasn't in the driveway, but when I got in the house I could hear his voice coming from the bedroom. Then a woman laughing. It wasn't my mom. Did you confront him? Well, did you tell your mom? Probably should of. Instead I just started fucking everything up, you know? Mm-hmm. At least you know your parents. I never met mine. One time in a foster home I broke this vase, turned out it was like 200 years old. Worth more than my life. And my foster dad, he screamed at me, and he said, you're just like your no good whore mother who couldn't even afford an abortion. So it's, it's something. I think about my mom a lot. She always saw the best in me. Wish I'd been better for her. When's the last time you saw her? Three years ago today. That's when I left. What do you wanna do today Bug? It's your special day. I wanna go home. So we're doing this again? He's not coming back, the sooner you accept that the better off we'll both be. It's been three years god damn it. What makes you think he's comin' back now? Oh Christ Jo, for all we all know he might even be... I'm just saying, this isn't helping anything. We're you goin'? I'm going to find my son. Fine, but I'm drivin', and we're not gonna stay out all night like last year. Did that stuff help with the pain? Yeah, but I need more. Well, I'm gonna have wait another two hours before I can give you another does. I need it now. What would you say your pain level is? Eight or nine. Okay, but you're gonna have take this one with some food. Fine. So, chicken sandwich or salad? Whatever works. Salad it is then. Should've gone with the chicken. Have you ever had hospital food? No. Trust me, it doesn't matter. What does matter, I got the extra dose. There you go. Thank you Emily. You're up. - I've never been. - Where? Europe, never been, but I've heard it's nice. It's beautiful. You've been there? Yeah, I did the last semester of my clinical in London. That's cool. Sorry for freaking out earlier. No worries, I've seen worst. The ER on a Friday night can be a pretty scary place. Do you remember anything about the accident? Yeah. There's a chunk missing. The driver, was he a friend? No. I'd like for you to be honest with me here. It's important, we're tryna get in touch with his family. Good luck with that. Where is he, is he all right? He passed an hour ago. He's dead? Yes. He suffered severe trauma to the head and it caused hemorrhaging to the brain, I'm sorry. Any family we could contact? Do you know where he lives? I know where he slept. Where's that? You know Ringer Park? Mm-hmm. That's where he slept. I see. Is that where you sleep? Yep. How are you feeling? Any pain? This will help. What is it? This is a pain medication called Dilaudid. It's lunch hour, you hungry? Should try and eat something. Chicken sandwich or salad? It doesn't matter. How far is your parents house from here? It's at least 20 miles, I mean, we can't walk. We could hitch. Yeah, we could try to hitch, we could end up just gettin' flipped off on the side of the freeway all night. No, I think train is the best bet. Hey, hey man, - just a little bit? - Nah, I'm sorry. - Nothin'? - Yeah, well all right, at this rate we're not gonna make it to Central. Dude, we'll be fine all right? It's like 15 stops. It'll be fine, we don't make it to Central we don't get fucking out of the city. - It's 10 bucks... - Steve? Steven Bugsby. Do I know you? Kyle. We went to high school. We got suspended together - that time... - For setting up Mr. Lafton's computer on top of the school. - Holy shit. - Holy shit. That was funny as hell. Dude, I remember that. My brother, you remember Cory? He's a senior now and he was telling me people are still talking about that shit. How's the family? They're good. Smartest guy I know right here. I would've failed English if it wasn't for him. Hey Kyle, our van kind of broke down a couple of blocks over, it's one of those old clunkers, you know the type, you think you could spare a couple of extra bucks for gas? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Can any of you guys break a 20? Fuck it. Kyle fucking Windsor, holy shit, who would've thought man, oh my god, thank you, this is huge. Don't mention it. Well, I gotta get going, but good luck with your car. For sure. Thanks Kyle. Thanks Kyle. There's your ticket home. And then some, let's get loaded. If you're gonna hang out here, you gotta buy something. Just give me a loosey and I'll be on my way. I told you a million times, I can't do that anymore, you can purchase a full pack or none at all. I wouldn't advise it though, those things will kill you though. I know that Eddie, that's why I only want one, if I get a whole pack I'll smoke it all in an hour. Oh, I got a birthday present for Bug, he's out there with you right? It's pulled beef stew my mum brought me to eat, still hot, can you send him in. We're a little busy right now Eddie, but I'll let him know. - Oh. - Oh hey Raleigh, just the man we wanted to see, you got any speed? Yeah, but no more freebies for you tweekers. You guys couldn't even afford one pill with the change in that cup. Where the fuck you get that? Bug's got friends in high places. Apparently. All right, what can we get for 10 of these? One for each of you. Trust me, one is all you guys'll need. This shit is heavy. Here you go, hey. And I'll even through in a little bit of weed for the birthday boy. You guys are gonna need it to keep your heads on straight. Weed and speed, it's a match made in heaven Raleigh. That's right, good night fuckers. Good night. All right. What the fuck's the plan here, where are we going? I all ready told you man, it's 20 stops maybe, 15, I don't know, it's been a fucking long time and I don't even know where we are bro. Okay, cool, great, so we're hop on drugs. Yeah, but we just gotta keep moving 'cause we're taking way too much freaking time. We're fucking moving dude, there's gotta be more trains than just the one train. All right, all right, all right, all right. Oh, fuck. Hold it right there. Evening. That doesn't smell like tobacco smoke to me. Oh, that's a good one man. Hey, don't get flip with me. Smoking marijuana in public is a criminal offense. I could run the through you right now. - Sorry man. - What, you fucking kidding. It's illegal, I told ya. - Yeah, all right. - Against the car over there, all three of ya's, come on. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - We're just tryna get - to the train. - Are you kidding me? Up against the car now. I said move. Put your hands on the back of our head. - All three of you. - Come on dude.

How much of last night do you remember? It was my birthday. Things get a little out of control? You could say that. Why don't we give the escape plan a rest Steven? Try and get some sleep. Dr. Flores dial 118 please, Dr. Flores please dial 118. That's my son, Steven Bugsby. Happy birthday. Thanks. How old? 21. Hospital room on your 21st huh? Yeah, it was not suppose to happen this way. Life doesn't always go the way we expect. Mrs. Bugsby? Yes. I'm your husbands nurse. How's he doing. He's fine, he's in stable condition and we expect him to be released today or tomorrow. Oh, thank god. How are you doing? I'm just fine. They ran a few precautionary tests and I'm cleared to go. When can I see my Roger? Is there anyone you can call, let 'em know you're all right? Friends? Last two friends I had are gone. Parents? I don't really think they'd care. Parents always care about their children. You got kids? A son. What's he like? Decent, just doesn't know it. Mrs. Bugsby, you should know that your husband is sharing a room with the young man who was in the car that collided with yours. Well I'm sure it was just an accident. There's something else. Investigating an armed robbery, not a case of shoplifting like they initially thought. Oh, you fucking pussy. - Stop, cut it out. - What? - Stop. - Okay. Just under an hour ago with the neighborhood market on Franklin street. Been told the store clerk has been taken to the hospital with serious injuries. Three suspects ran... Oh. Come on, get in. Get in. Shortly after taking cash from the register, according to police, two of the suspects then stole a parked car outside. One suspect is armed and possibly dangerous. Yes, I want to report a break in. Look at this huh. Oh, wouldn't wanna get a smack off of that, would you, huh? I gotta piss, man, where's the bathroom? Down the hall to the left.

Good, that's good. It's important to stay busy, stay out of your head. You taking your medication? - Yeah. - Every day? Every day. So, do you feel safe? Is anyone giving you a hard time? No, mom, it's not like that. So what about your new cell mate, what's he like? I don't know, we don't really talk that much. Well you should, make friends. Wrap it up. Well you know you can call us anytime, day or night, just call. Yeah, the guards might object to that, but I'll tell 'em you said it's okay. Oh, well thank you very much, appreciate that. Happy birthday Steven. Thanks. You know we love you very much? Love you guys too. Steven, we'll be back next week. Eddie, I hope you don't think I'm tryna justify what happened. I'm not. Things got so out of control so fast. That night, that wasn't me, I didn't recognize myself, like watching everything unfold before my eyes, from a distance, from somewhere else, helpless. In here I have so much time to think, it's all I do. So many uncertainties, so much unknown. I don't know anything about you Eddie. Not really. And I fucking hate that. I hate that I hurt you. Some days I hate myself, completely, to my core. You have every right to share that sentiment. You should. Writing to you has helped me get through this. This isn't an apology. I don't deserve to ask you to forgive me, you got caught in the crossfire of something that has simmering beneath my skin my entire life. I guess I just want you to understand. Thank you for this.
