For the kind attention of passengers. Train no. 6602... Chennai Mail from Mangalore to Chennai, will reach platform number 1 at 19:35 hours. Sir, my friend got late to leave from home. He will reach by 7:45 PM. Will the train wait here until then? Why not? I'll tell the driver! Thank you, sir. -Such a nice man. -Yeah, right! As if Indian Railways is his ancestral property! Shucks! Please, sir. I'm no. 10 on the waiting list. Get me a seat somehow. This waiting list is not a license... for people who don't have a ticket to board the train. There are no berths even for RAC tickets. I'm fed up of Malayali students like you, who come to Chennai. Please, sir. Just try! Somehow! Somehow... Please, sir. Do one thing. There's a loser over there who's no. 57 on the waiting list. Go and sit with him. Okay. Thank you, sir. Thank you! But sir... Where is he sitting? You'll know when you see him. Got it? Get going. [singing a famous Malayalam song] Pass the snack, please. Excuse me. -What is it? -Err.... Are you no. 57 on the waiting list? That's correct. How did you know that? Well, the ticket examiner had told me. Is that so? Sit down. Come on! Are you studying in Chennai? I'm going to join... KC Tech. I'm also joining KC Tech. New admission, ECE. I'm also doing ECE. So we're classmates, dude! He has also done ECE. He's working in LSB Corp now. -Andrew. -Arun. I studied in KPR college. Isn't it a good college? It's a good college, alright. But there's only one problem. If we talk to girls, we'll be dismissed immediately. -Seriously? -Yeah! This problem isn't limited to students alone. The same rule applies for the teachers there. Separate seating for girls and boys in the college bus, with an iron rod in the centre. -It's too much, man! -But your college gives a lot of freedom. KC Tech, Karappakkam. Oh, it's a beautiful campus! Brother... -How's Chennai? -Chennai? You're going to be there for the next four years, right? When you board the train back home once you finish your studies, you'll feel as if someone is tugging at your heartstrings. At that moment, you'll realize what Chennai is. ♪ Do you hear the voice? ♪ ♪ Do you hear the voice of Mother Thamizh Who lets her visitors flourish? ♪ Our college! ♪ Is it inviting you? ♪ ♪ Is the college road inviting you, Showering flowers upon you? ♪ -Step forward. -Get lost.

I see you play the guitar as well. Yeah, a lil'. Cool, bro. We should jam sometime. Why not! Jam Jam! -Anto, from Kottayam. -I'm Lijo, from Kottayam. Are you both from Kottayam? Are you from Kottayam? -Yeah, I'm from Kanjikkuzhi. -I'm from Lakkattoor. -Ron. -Where are you from? -Abu Dhabi. -Where? Abu Dhabi? -Yeah, dude. -Oh! Nice gold chain! It will be useful later. -Arun, right? -Arun. -I'm from Palakkad. -Which one's your room? -Ours is at that corner. -But it's the toilet at the corner, right? You see this? This lock and grill is to protect you... from a major part of the ragging. So you don't have to worry that much. What is he saying? Dude, this grill will be locked at 9:30 PM. So the Malayali seniors cannot come downstairs and rag us. Ragging is rampant here, huh? Yes, mostly among Malayali students. Our people are like this, wherever we go! Don't smile! Does anyone of you ride a horse? You do horse-riding? Err, no. I'd like to learn, though. Cool. Join me! -You do horse-riding? -No, I'll come walking. -Okay. -What's all this? Organ and music system? This is not allowed here. Throw it out! Come on! Keep the volume down. -Who is it? Come here. -Get lost! -Are you in first year? -Yes, sir. Twins, huh? Hey! Ask him to switch on the motor! Hey Manoharan! You scoundrel! -Who called me scoundrel? -I did, you scoundrel! -Who called me scoundrel? -Switch on the motor! Come, dude! The first years will be introduced to the college. -Didn't you have it in your school? -No, Kanjikkuzhi doesn't have all this. Which damn school did you study in? We always put our students as the highest priority when it comes to academics, in KCG College of Technology. We have a great academic curriculum. So students, I welcome you all to this prestigious institution. This is the main quadrangle. This side, if you can see, there's the mechanical laboratory here. And our IT department is on that side. So guys, this is the analog circuit lab. You know what has to be done here! There's something very special about this space. Can you see that door? That actually leads to an alley. That is known as the secret alley. Hey! What's she saying? Do you see the door at that corner? It's called 'The Secret Alley'. Annie? Not 'Annie', it's Alley! That means, a secret path. So, on the last day... When we're in our final year, on the last day of college, the Vice-Principal will give us the key to that alley. Only on that day can we see what's inside. God, I hope I'll be able to reach final year. Can't we get a duplicate key to this alley? We'll see. So what's actually inside the secret alley? I'll know it at the end of my college days. So, till then, let it be a secret. -Okay. -Yeah. -It's gonna be epic. -It's good to wait for good things. -Akash Gupta? -Yes, sir. -Akhil Sathyan? -Yes, sir. Alan George Akkara? Antony Thadikkaran? Sir! -Arun Neelakandan? -Present, sir. -Puneet Singh? -Yes, sir. Ron Valiveettil? Sir, it's 'Valiyaveettil'. Valiveettil. That's right. Sit down, man! Why Tamil people are like this? -Selva Soundarrajan. -Yes, sir! Students! I am very strict about one thing. No arrears in my class. -What does 'arrears' mean? -Supplementary exams! -Oh! 'Supply'! -Sir? -Your name? -Alan George. Come in. So, today we discuss about engineering mechanics. The seniors have called all the Malayali juniors to the hostel. Welcome to St. Thomas Hall. There are certain things that you need to be aware of, while you're here. There are some rules that you have to follow. The first one is... 'Engineer's salute!' Farooq! Explain it to them. Place your left hand on your forehead. Cover your groin area with your right hand, thrust your backside forward, and make the sound - 'Phyung'! Who laughed now? Which pig laughed now? Huh? Laugh! Laugh again! Baiju! Repeat what Farooq said. Engineer's salute! Repeat! 'Phyung'! Good. Now, on to the next point. As Indian citizens, it is the duty of each one of you, to support local industries. -Isn't that so? -Yes. -Isn't it? -Yes. So, for this entire academic year, you will only use Indian-made clothes, and Indian-made undergarments. Okay? What underwear are you wearing, kiddo? Which one was it? -Jockey. -Ah! What about you? Calvin Klein. Huh? Calvin Klein? Hey you! If you wear a foreign brand ever again, you'll face a barrage of punches. Go to some shady shop in Thiruvanmiyur or Adyar today itself, and buy shirts, pants and underwear, that are unfashionable and ill-fitting. You heard me? And... one more thing. The sleeves of your shirts should be rolled down and buttoned. And since watches and shoes are against Indian culture, you won't use them. You can use Indian sandals though. Farooq... Tell them about the ID card, as well. And wherever you see Malayali seniors, you should salute us, and show us your ID cards. Okay, right? It is okay. So, Farooq... Give them their Indian names, as well. Give them great nicknames. -Kanaran! -Huh? Damu! Moosa! Syedali! Korah! Ambadi. Purushu! -Ambu! -Salute! Phyung! Repeat! Phyung! My Indian name is quite pathetic. Damu! What's yours? Kanaran! Mine's not so bad then. Do they get to decide what clothes we should wear? This is too much! -Shall we complain? -Ah! Mess with them as soon as you join! Dude, this ragging won't last for the entire year. It will loosen up after the first semester. -Then they will become friends with us. -Of course! And in my opinion, let's listen to those guys for now. Which college doesn't have ragging now? Not in Kanjikkuzhy, though. And when we get to second year, we can do all this too, right? That's all! Cut chart paper to the size of your college ID, and stick your photo here. Your name, Indian name, name of your course and your underwear. That's how it should be written. Also, the name of your underwear, should be cut out from your underwear and stapled on to your ID. The ID should be laminated. -Hey! A rickshaw is coming. -Bro! -Hey Lijo! -Take us to Karappakkam. -This cab is too small, man! -Shut up! Scoundrel from Abu Dhabi! Hey! -Good morning, sir. -Where's your ID card? -Where is it? -Sir... Here it is, Sir. -Salute us quickly and get going. -Fools! Phyung! Who's next? 'Don't know' is not a movie! Hit him! Come on! Whom do we catch next? Yes, this should be fun. What is the... chemical name of Potassium, in Chemistry? -"P". -P? Pee in your mouth, man! It's 'K', man! Hit him! Hit him! Harder! Come on! How many states in Tamil Nadu? Tamil Nadu? How many states? Fast! How many states in Tamil Nadu? -Tell me. -44. Forty four? -Congratulations! Great! Great! -Thank you. Give him a prize! Tamil Nadu itself is a State, you dumbo! Hit him! Hit him! Hit him hard! How many checks in your shirt? It's not mine. It's his shirt. Is he cursing us? Dude, that bald HOD is coming. Let's escape. Dude, those guys have left. Come on, get up. Get up. They have left. Get up, dude! I don't know what it is. There's something about her. Her eyes, hair... Her smile... I want to know her name! -I want to find out now. -Calm down! We'll ask someone. It's okay. I don't want to know her name by asking someone else. The fact that I want to know her name... She should know that first. [Singing Kannalane from Bombay] Such a beautiful voice! I want to romance a girl like her and marry her somehow. I can listen to songs all the time, right? Why go for someone like her? Romance this girl itself and get married to her! Come, it's time for the lab session. Let her be. She'll be here. She's good, right? Yaay! -Wow! -Really nice voice. But we need somebody to back her up. What about a guitar? Do we have a guitarist? There's someone from first year ECE. Okay. You talk to him then. When are we starting the rehearsals? We should start practising soon. You have a beautiful voice. Thanks. May I know your name? I'm Darshana. Darshana! I am Arun. First year, ECE. Okay. I'll see you again. You are so damn confident, man! Once you like a girl, you should never shy away. It's bad enough to not do anything about it. Stalking is even worse. We should approach them directly. If she's single, she'll be thinking about me now. What if she's committed? May I know your name? I'm Darshana. She's not committed. Bro, you're gonna perform with Darshana. For Fresher's day? Yes, sir. -I'm performing with Darshana? -Yes! -Nishant Bhai, love you! -Hey! Look! Look! Focus! You play the guitar, right? No, no. I just carry it around! And you Mallu guys say something often, right? 'Poyi Pollikk Mone' (Go, burn it) It's not 'Pollikk'. 'Polikk' (Go, kill it) - Oh! Polikk! [Singing 'Kannalane' from Bombay] You can rehearse during break time. Go to your class! I said, go to your class! You've been putting up quite a show, ever since you got here. Haven't we told you to roll down your sleeves and button them? Do it! You considered giving a complaint against us, and now you're trying to woo a girl from first year. We know everything! Bloody scoundrel! If I see you anywhere near Darshana again, I'll knock your eyes out! Got it, you dog? -Oh no! Keerthy Ma'am! -What's happening here? Dude, Keerthy Ma'am is here. Why are you guys here? Jackson! Baiju! I had warned you guys several times. You guys are testing my patience! If I come to know that you've ragged any junior, I will sack you guys out of this college. Understood? Get out! Let's get going, dude. Come on! Let's scram. This Keerthy Ma'am is acting so tough! She doesn't have any respect for boys. Yeah, right. Get lost! When we were being shouted at, that scoundrel was laughing. We have to get back at him, Jackson! Wait till we find him all alone. We'll get back at him. We'll teach him a lesson! Bro, do you have 100 bucks on you to recharge my phone? No, bro. -Even if I did, I wouldn't give you. -Miser! -What? -Drying unwashed clothes! Aren't you coming, bro? I'm not feeling well, dude. I think I have a fever. This is out of fear, because the seniors threatened you. Get lost. If I had a Bible as well, I could give sermons! -In this outfit? -This is so pathetic! Girls are laughing as soon as they see me. Pick me up! They are at least laughing when they see you, right? -I don't get even that. -There goes another guy. Such a pity! Are you sure that he's alone over there? Yes, I am. Who told you? Our spy. Kick it open! Hold him! Baiju, thrash him! Hit him! Kick him! Punch him! Hit him! Knock him out! Stuff something in his mouth! Punch him hard! -Hit him! -Hey! What the bloody hell are you guys doing here? Let go of him, you bloody... What are you looking at? If any of you even touch him again, I swear I'll smash your skulls so hard, your bloody brains will fall out of your mouth! Now get the hell out of here! Get out! Hey Arun! Are you okay? They didn't leave the room because they got scared of Prateek Tiwari. There's something that any Malayali who's born and brought up in Kerala, fears the most, wherever they go. Let go of him! English! If any of you even touch him again, I swear I'll smash your skulls so hard, your bloody brains will fall out of your mouth! Now get the hell out of here! Get out! He and his damn English! He thinks that we don't know English! I was just listening to my music, okay? Then I hear screams from the other room. And these guys were beating him so badly, dude! Prateek, he was just talking to Darshana. And... they were rehearsing together. -Because he spoke to Darshana? -Yeah. How can you just beat somebody up because he's talking to somebody? What are you trying to do? -Nishant Bhai? -Yeah, Arun. Do you have sunglasses? Once your greatest fear in life, occurs in all its glory, nothing else matters, thereafter. Once we gain that confidence, then we're awesome! Frickin' awesome! You haven't had enough, huh? Where's your ID card? Don't want me to salute? You...!! They hit him very badly. When did this happen? Yesterday. Come with me. Where are we going? Vice-Principal's office. Okay, let's go. -Are you sure that he's alone there? -Yes. -Who told you? -Our spy. Shall we complain? Bro, you're gonna perform with Darshana. I'm performing with Darshana? We don't encourage ragging in this campus. Okay. And if the seniors have done this, strict action will be taken against them. Thank you, sir. Are you afraid of them? I'm not afraid of anyone! Come! -We must beat him up! -We will! Let's make this more interesting. You go ahead. I'll follow you. Has anyone dared to mess with us in the past three years? When I asked for the ID card, he... I'm telling you! We'll teach him a lesson! She walked along with me, showing her middle finger... to the seniors who beat me to pulp. I had my arms around her. In that moment, I felt like a king. Smack him! Punch him hard! Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? Hit me with everything you've got, bro! I don't give a damn! You know why? 'coz Darshana is mine!

It's your first outing, right? Yeah. Make it memorable! Yeah! See... So, the security sleeps at 12 o'clock, okay? So you can come through the main gate. Be very quiet. Okay. The main gate's key. Sis', you're too good! Fifty Rupees! Hail the Almighty! Climb up! Phew! Get down! Arun... Ever since you proposed to me, every day when you come to the college, everytime you pass through the veranda, everytime you look at me from St. Thomas Hall, I've felt like shouting out loud... that I really like you! But there's this thrill in making you wait... What I have to tell you now.. is something you've already told me. I fell in love with you the moment I saw you. ♪ Your fragrance everywhere, all the time ♪ ♪ Your fragrance everywhere, all the time ♪ G... Good night. One minute! Okay, go! Come on!

Get going! -Where is he going? -He'll be right back. I love you! Say it again? I love you! Shall I kiss you? My friends are watching from up there. Oh no! And your mouth is stinking too! Go and get ready. See you in college. -Aren't you going to your hometown today? -Yes. Can you come to Kochi with me? What's the matter? There's a girl who I used to chat with, on Yahoo Messenger. She was very co-operative, online. What happened then? My computer was struck by lightning during the monsoon. By the time I got it repaired and came back online to chat, she fell for someone else. But now, she has come back with a vengeance, bro! I want to celebrate her comeback! And you want me to come along, for this ribaldry? Huh? In my life so far, nothing has happened! Nothing at all! Can you come with me? I will. Bro! We'll have a blast in Kochi! What is this? Crushed pickle? -'Morning Sir. -Hi. Thanks. Sir, that's a finger bowl. I know! It doesn't have sugar. It's for washing your hands. But it's good water. We can drink it. Aren't you done yet? I mean, are you done? What do you think? Are they serious? Didn't you ask your friend? No. She asked me to come and I tagged along. Your campus life must be awesome in Chennai, right? Hostel, full freedom... When I see students going back home on the bus, I feel slightly jealous. Home-cooked food, parents... I miss all that. My parents are divorced. I'm sorry. Don't be! They were always at loggerheads. So, isn't it better to get separated? I like your hair colour. I like your eyes. Do you have a girlfriend? No! That side is fully occupied. Let's sit over there. One second. I'll be right back. How much does this umbrella cost? 250 Rupees. Run! Run! Those scoundrels are here! -Damn! I should've just worn pants! -Don't run away, dear! -Get lost, you dog! -I came all the way from Madras for this! Wait! Let's go to some isolated place. Wait, please! Chicken Lasagunia! Beef stick! Lime juice without sugar! And the bus tickets, to and fro. I am such a colossal disaster, Oh God! Shucks! I cheated on Darshana. Aargh! Don't keep repeating yourself! You didn't even touch that girl. I couldn't touch my girl either. Yet, I chose to forget her for a while, and had other thoughts in mind, right? Look at me! Who doesn't have such thoughts? Even Mahatma Gandhi has had such thoughts! Read his autobiography if you have a doubt. And... don't go and blabber anything to her, out of guilt. Listen, you haven't done anything to her. Let's just... forget this day! Bloody Chicken Lasaguniya! -Lasagna! -I know! Don't rub it in! I felt sad watching the news yesterday. Can't anyone in Kerala be in love? Those were not family members or relatives. Some random people were beating up those kids. They took an umbrella from a boy and hit him on his head. One boy wearing a T-shirt like yours, was running for his life. Okay, I'll message you once the lab session is over. Let's bunk class and go for a movie. Darshana! Yes? I have to tell you something. I don't know how you're going to take it. Arun! I got here on time, thanks to this umbrella I found in your room! Darshana! Darshana, wait! -Let go of me. -Darshana, please! -Darshana, listen to me! -Let go! Darshana, I haven't done anything wrong! When Antony said he wanted to meet a girl, I went along. I sat on that bench with her friend. When she asked me if I had a girlfriend, I said no. I haven't done anything wrong. Why did you say that you don't have a girlfriend? Well, when such a hot chick is in front of me.. Shucks! What the hell did you tell her, dude? Shucks! Hello, Megha? Don't call on my friend's phone, okay? Darshana, please listen to me. There's nothing between us any more. Forever! Just listen to me, Darshana. Please! I'm really sorry. But don't think that I will spare you! I'll romance another guy and walk around hugging him, right before you. You wanted to kiss me, right? I'll kiss him a hundred times, right in front of your eyes. With that umbrella in your hand, you can stand and watch, you bloody pervert! Will you do that? Will you do that? Then listen to this, as well. After running away from there, Antony and I checked in at Hotel Kochi Courtyard with those girls. He was in 202... and I was in 203. It was awesome! Go and say this to all the girls in your hostel! That's not necessary. All of them are listening. You're on loudspeaker, you moron! Aargh!! Yet again, I've become a colossal disaster for no reason at all, dear God! Sandeep! -Hey Arun! -Are you happy now? -Let go of him! -She broke up with me! That umbrella! Didn't you do it deliberately, you dog? -Let go of him! -Move away! I know, you dog! You snitched on me to the seniors and ruined my life, you piece of shit! -I will kill you. -Wait. Calm down!! What do you even know? He told the seniors everything that happened here, because they beat him up. He didn't give that umbrella to you, on purpose! -Let go of him! -Move aside! Who is he to beat me up!

I'm fed up of staying in the hostel. An apartment is almost ready. I have to shift quickly, if possible. That's nice. We'll get to spend some alone time together. Hi sir. -Yeah. -Hi, Ma'am. One sec. Could you excuse me? Right. What happened? Darshana, what I mean... Hello? You messed with the wrong guy, darling. You shouldn't have slapped me. Just wait for the stories that are going to spread about you in campus, from tomorrow. You slept with me! You got pregnant with me! No guy will see you as a girl any more. They'll look at you like a slut! This is just a starter. The main course will follow. Good luck! ♪ This whole world is a hellhole ♪ ♪ You will learn your lesson ♪ ♪ This is a hellhole, yeah!

Wanna stick around? Loser! Babe! Don't worry! I won't bite! Mommy! WHAT? WHY? WHO ARE YOU??? Not on the face, please! What? Oh my God! -Serves him right! -Shruthi! Shruthi! George, Kedar is not here. -I think he has left. -Stop it, dude! What are you trying to prove? I know what to do with people who hurt me. I don't need help from anybody! And not even for a moment should you think that you're any better than him! Can't you see that two people are talking? And you're grinning in between that? Come. What? Do you want to hit me? No, bro. I've come to take him. This is the fourth time you're getting beaten up this month. Aren't you fed up? Shut up! Reverse! Reverse! Reverse! -Brother, go to the hospital quickly. -Okay. My father is really sick. I've been thinking about going to my home town. What about the exams? I am feeling really stressed staying here. Go and come back soon. Have you ordered any food, bro? -Woah! -Oh my God! Shut up! Oh my darling! Losers! Where does he get these girls from? -Oh my God! -Learn from him! Don't destroy our image as well. Keep quiet! -I can't bear this, you dog. -It's alright. Just chill. -Who cleaned all this? -Hey! Get the snacks. Joji, the opener must be somewhere over there. -Bring it. -I'll open it with my mouth. It's so hot. -I can't find it here. -Bring it quickly, dude. Bro, can you give me that girl's number? Hi sir. Arun, pay for it. I'll pay you later. I don't have money. Sorry, sir. I can't take it back. You can't? -No, sir. -Then you shove it up! What is this? Didn't I say that I'll return the money? When have you ever returned the money? You come here only to drink and sleep with girls, right? Why are you talking like this, you scoundrel? There's a limit to how much a person can tolerate. Is this even a house? Is there even an inch of clean space here? Whenever I walk in, this place reeks of vomit and urine. I even throw your condoms into the garbage. Hey Arun! Don't go overboard. Here you are! Change your name from Lijo to 'Anto's lackey'. Why do you alone have such an issue with me, you prick? No one else has any issue. That's right. I'm the only one who has an issue. None of you have any issue! Right? Arun, come on. Let's arrive at a compromise. You know, right? It's Anto! It's our Anto! Come on. Let's arrive at a compromise. Compromise? You go compromise. You guys can rot inside this filth for the next two years and die! Hey! Come in! Dude... -Just for tonight. -What's this, man? Come inside. Mom, this is Arun! Hello! The food will be ready now. -Akku.. -You can go and freshen up, son. -Show him the room. -What is this? Why are you like this? Come, go and get freshened up. We'll have dinner after that, okay? -Sir? -Over? No, sir. Additional sheet, please. Thank you. It's been two days since he came here. He hasn't spoken to me at all. I told you, right? Didn't you notice his face and his body? I have a strong feeling that he has been drinking. Please talk to him. I'm well aware... of how I lived my life, when I was your age. That's why I don't advise you, though your mother keeps compelling me to. I know that you're away from us. But... don't think that you are alone. For anything and everything, your father is here for you. Understood? You should quit alcohol. Dad... I don't really... drink. What hurts me more than you drinking alcohol, is the fact that you're lying to me. Will you quit? If you won't feel embarrassed, can I give you a hug? What is this, son? So, just like the last time, -Puneet Singh is first. -Thank you, Ma'am. Selva Soundarrajan is second. -Good job, Selva. -Thank you, Ma'am. -Akhil Sathyan is third. -Thank you, Ma'am. -Lokesh is fourth. -Thanks, Ma'am. -And Dhruv is fifth. -Thank you, Ma'am. Congratulations, guys. Most of you have improved, except for the Malayali students. Arun has cleared one paper. Rest, all of you are washed out. Can't you join some other course? Wasting so many seats unnecessarily! Arun! Bye! -Awesome job, bro! -How, bro? There's nothing like that, bro. Hey! Our classmate, Selva? He's running a combined study group. Shall we ask him if we can also join? He has no airs about himself. We'll ask him, huh? Yes. Combined study it is, then. Hey! Over there. Hey Selva! -Selva! -Yes! Hey! What are you guys doing here? Selva! Will you let us join your combined study group? Oh! You may join! Hold this. -Usha Akka! I've kept the water here. -Selva, the milk packet! -They kept it here? -It's leaking! Come on. -Hey! Keep it there. -Here? There's no water here. This has been a never ending problem in our city, for many years. Come, dude! This is our area! -Maari Anna! -Yes! Pay your electricity bill today itself. They will disconnect it otherwise. -Okay, Selva. Hey! Careful, guys! Lachu Paatti (grandma)! Five minutes! -Sambar Saadham is getting ready. - Okay! Hey Arun! Come, dude! What is this? A bandit's hideout? Come on! -Hey! Give me your hand! -Selva! This is our place! Anyone can come here... and learn! 75% of the people here... are not from well-to-do families. They were sidelined because they were poor. But wait and watch! Ten years from now, each student in this group will be going places! Don't look at it as just another combined study group. This is a student movement. To change our destiny, we initiated this silent revolution. Shucks! x-u=t dx=dt x=t+u -Yaay! -Yes! -Raja! -Selva! His name is Raja. He's from Pannaipuram. He creates amazing music. You have arrears in the fourth semester, right? Yes. Third semester? Yes. Second? We have arrears in every semester, Selva. Don't hurt our feelings talking about all that. So, let's start with Maths and Physics. If you understand Maths and Physics, it's like you've understood the whole world. Here you go. Kaali! -First semester, Maths. -We've just started. Come on!

You also have cleared a lot of papers. Me? Good going! I'm too good, bro! Arun! When are you giving us a treat? We have class only till noon today, right? Let's go to Hotel Crescent and have Mutton Biriyani. -Can I call our boys? -Call everyone! Super! By the way, bro... After that, can you come with me to meet Selvi? I have... bought a saree for her. Huh? You're already buying her sarees and all? Hey! Don't yell bro! I hope the people there don't pummel you! Shut up! -What is it? -Forget it. Hey! Please stop at an ATM counter on the way.

I'll tell you later. Move back now. -Go back, please. -What happened, sir? The bus ran over a third year student! -Hey! -What? Selva!!! Selva! Selva! Selva! Move away! Make way! I found this in Selva's bag. The saree he bought for Tamizhselvi. Arun... His house is near Arakkonam. Since it's outside the city, I don't think many students would come there. Shouldn't we go and see him? I can't see him like that! Don't come if you don't want to. I will go! I won't let him burn to ashes without anyone by his side. I will go! Amma, how do we go to the cremation ground? -Go straight. -Straight? Selva! Where have you gone, leaving us behind? Selva! Selva! Look at our Selva. Whom do we have now? Selva's parents. What's your dream, Selva? I dream of the day my parents can sleep without a worry. What more can I ask for? We shouldn't cry, brother. It's just his body that's being consumed by the fire. Just his body. Is he just that? Is that all there is to Selva? He is hiding. He is here, somewhere. ♪ Hiding beneath the clouds ♪ ♪ Is the allure of the sun ♪ ♪ I saw him I felt his warmth ♪ Selva!

Shall I get you something to eat? I don't want anything. Mom has fallen asleep. You can leave now, Arun. Okay. Bye. Hey! Hey! Hey! What happened? Papa... He was wearing this shirt even this morning. We have no one now, Arun. If I ask you something, will you say the truth? Have you ever... loved me the way you loved Darshana? That was a night which made me feel extremely lonely and guilty. Someone who was always around, but someone whom I'd never spoken to... On that night, I noticed a cycle tea-seller. I felt like talking to him. How many years has it been since you came to Chennai? I came here when this city was called Madras. When I came here, none of this was here. Did you come here in search of a job? Cinema! Acting? In the '80s, I had produced around seven to eight Malayalam films. What's your name? A heavy downpour happened and ceased over the same night. Semester exams began, soon after. None of us realized how another year went by. Campus placements, preparations for higher studies... In the meanwhile, I patched up with my Malayali friends. I'm asking this because we've royally flunked all our exams. Shall we join your combined study group? Why not! You should all come. We'll see. That's great. -How much? -200 Rupees. Two Hundred... Hey Arun! I'll pay! Let's split it. All the top students in my class... were targeting foreign universities and studying accordingly. Darshana, Kaali and I... got jobs in campus placements. The ones who clear a lot of back papers at one go, will be adept at meeting deadlines. Due to this finding by the HR department, even our Malayali group could secure jobs at good companies. -Yaay! -Maya! During the last semester, I could see an extremely happy Maya laughing out loud. Joe! I'm really sorry, Joe. It's okay, sir. You don't have to call me Sir. Call me Arun. Okay, Arun. Arun... Can I ask you something? Maya... Why did she break up with you? She deserved someone better. That day, finally, I got a load of guilt off my chest. Then, finally came... the last day in KC Tech. The last day of college. It was beautiful! We all felt really close to each other. All of us were together. Except Kaali. Selva! Selva! Which train are you taking? Mangalore Mail. I will come. Guys, guys! I got the key to the secret alley! -Woah! -Secret alley? All of us ran towards the secret alley, which our senior Jasleen had shown us, in the first year of college. Dude, it's totally dark out here.

[Traditional folk song] I keep watching your videos. Food vlogging. Nice! It's gaining popularity. Our subscriber base has been growing. You must be making a lot of money from YouTube, right? It barely covers my fuel bills. Slog like a slave, get paid peanuts, feel like a queen. That's my present situation. It's a new venture, right? It will take some time to convert to cash. But there's one thing. I feel really peaceful. That feeling... I have no idea how to achieve that. I don't have any particular passion either. I don't know what to do. You do one thing. -Quit your job. -And? Wander around like you? Wander around for a bit. Then, find what you really like. And get into that. Money will follow. What if it doesn't? You will starve! My grandmother used to say... "When we're really hungry, we'll find ways to feed ourselves" And where's your grandma now? She's dead! But she had a point. Are you a photographer? I click photos, yeah. How's this camera? -It's okay for me. -Is it? -Can I have a look? -Err... Oh! Woah! -This is beautiful. -Thank you. -What's your name? -Arun. I am Jimmy. I'm a wedding photographer. What about you? I was with Infomax, but now I'm not working. -So you're not working currently? -Nope. Not working currently! Do you believe in destiny? -I don't know much about all that. -Ah! It's good that you don't. You'll go crazy! You know how it is for me? If I wish for something, it will be brought right before me. -By whom? -God! I was just thinking of quitting my job, starting my own wedding photography company and hiring a good photographer. And here you are! Don't think any further. Let's collaborate! -Well, I.. -Why? You don't want to collaborate? I didn't mean that. -I'm not a professional. -That's not a problem. And, we just met, right? Yeah! We should have met much earlier. We got late. I felt so too. I have great contacts. I'm serious. We can cover at least four or five weddings in a month. I'll pay you Rs. 20,000 for each wedding. What say? -How much? -Err... 20,000 Rupees. Okay! Twenty five! Fine! 30,000. Don't ask for more than that. Please! I need to think about it. Go ahead. I'll be right here. -Sir, ticket? -I didn't buy it? No. I forgot! I keep forgetting things wherever I go. You rascal! Even you managed to get married? Here! Look over here! -Hey! -Move away! Smile, please! Who's that? -Hey Sathish! -Move away, you! Don't crowd around. Please move! -Over here! -Excuse me! Smile, damn it! Come on, stand here, you hag! Get lost! The feast is ready at the dining hall. After getting photos clicked, all of you may proceed to the dining hall. Smile! Smile! And they shall become one. Even if he is starving, he should feed her. Even if he is starving... Feed, feed! -Please! Just one! -Get lost! -Phew! -Oops! Careful! Hey! What is this? What kind of photos are these? You've covered the groom's family really well. -We're the ones paying you, right? -There's still more to pay. -I'm the bride's mother, right? -Yeah! Have you clicked a single photo of me smiling? No. What kind of photographer are you? -What's your name? -Jimmy! Nice name! Take this with you! -But I.. -Just get lost! What? They think they can say anything if they are paying us! But they want everything to be done! It's a grand wedding, right? Candid photography, traditional photography... Traditional with candid photography... Helicam, Jimmy Jib and what not! Where do I take all this? To that town hall! And that place has no AC or fridge! I mean... no fans! And there are those saree-clad aunties, sweating like they just took a steam bath. Didn't that hag say that there's no smiling photo of hers? To make people smile when they don't, have I learned morphing? -Jimmy bro! -What? Come here. What do you think about these photos? They are really nice. They were clicked in Chennai by a photographer named Danny for a company called 'Weddings by Alpheus'. This company doesn't cover grand weddings. They cover only small weddings of people who are educated, wise and mature enough. With just immediate family members and close friends in attendance, Intimate weddings! There's no brand which specializes exclusively in intimate weddings, currently in Kerala. Why don't we start one? Why not? Let's start it today itself. So that we can sit at home from tomorrow. Dude, what do you think? You think weddings are conducted in Kerala to get two people married? A wedding here is a huge celebratory event, where people invite relatives, friends and acquaintances... ... to show off their pomp and grandeur. Take your intimate concept to them and watch how they react! -Sheesh! -Jimmy bro! Many people are reconsidering the idea of having grand weddings. Most Hindi actors are getting married like this now. Even our actor Prithviraj got married like this! Oh yeah! Rajuettan is awesome! If we target Kerala alone, we'll be in a fix. We should market our company all over India. If we start this now, when intimate weddings start trending in Kerala, we will be the kings here! Everyone is running after grand weddings now. Should we run along with them, or ahead of them? Think about it! ♪ Enough is enough Speak to me with a smile ♪ ♪ You inhabit my heart ♪ -Is this his new song? -Yes. ♪ What is the use of running away? ♪ ♪ You keep pulling me towards you Using your magic ♪ The tea is very nice.

I have a friend, Arun Neelakandan. And he's one of the best photographers that I know personally. Dude, he's hyping you up! Now he's starting his own wedding photography brand... ...called Blue Eye Intimate Weddings. Ours? So, the first couple to book their wedding with this brand, I will sing at their wedding, for free! Did he say that he'll sing for free, at our first wedding? Did he just say free? Are you sure? -Prateek, I love you man! -I love you too, dude! Who is he? He is my friend! Friend? Sure, sir. Sure, sir. We can do all that. With that single video from Prateek Tiwari... we received around 20 wedding enquiries in two days. The most surprising fact was that many of them were from Kerala. If we get all this advance money, we'll rock it! Your idea is fantastic, man! blueye10 Why is your email ID like this? It's been like that since 10th grade. My dad is my hero. So I just modified my dad's name a little bit. Neelakandan. Neela (blue) kan (eye) ten. So creative! Don't pull my leg, Jimmy bro! What's your family name? Is it Mangalassery? -No! -No? -Not at all? -No! As I started covering weddings of my choice, I began enjoying wedding photography thoroughly. Framing, lighting, composition, technique... None of this mattered. I gradually learnt that capturing the hearts of the people before you, is what photography is all about. I started anticipating. Happiness! Sorrow! Tears! Celebrations! Romp! I was loving what I was doing. The greatest attraction of wedding photography... is the freedom that we get. We can keep clicking photos of all the girls attending the wedding, with no restrictions. When we go for certain weddings, we feel that the bride is nothing... in front of her cousins, friends or bridesmaids. So many girls! Sigh! O' dear God! And at one such wedding, I saw her for the first time. She wasn't like the other girls whom I'd forget immediately after clicking them. -Nithya! -Her face... Nithya! It pierced right into my heart. Many years after Darshana, I couldn't take my eyes off a girl. Nithya. [Nagumo a Carnatic composition by Shri Tyagaraja] -Come, sis'. -I'll come later. -Come on! -I'll come later. Come on! Fine, don't come! So much attitude! I can send the photos on WhatsApp if you want them. Aww! Nice try to get my number! Mail them to me. If you won't mind, may I say something? Okay. I didn't like even a single photo of yours that I clicked. You're very beautiful! Your eyes, your face, your smile. I haven't been able to capture any of these correctly. -Mail ID? -Huh? Your... email ID? Yeah. It was lovely meeting you, Nithya. I'm Arun. What's happening, man? Jimmy bro! Did you see that girl? Yeah, yeah! I'm seeing everything. I'm going to marry her. Yeah, right! Have you seen her? A girl like her! Do you think boys... that too, the boys of Kochi, would forsake her? Do you really think so? She must be committed. I am sure! She's not committed. [Nagumo continues] Hey! Nithya has e-mailed us. She showed the photos we sent to her family. Everyone liked it. She has asked us if we can cover her cousin sister's wedding in Chennai. Don't miss this work. This is the best chance for you to hit on her. Kedar Kamalesh? What's wrong? We should meet Nithya, in person. I can't believe it! He seemed like such a nice person. I didn't know that he's this kind of a guy. All this happened when I was in college. Maybe, he's a changed man now. Ask your family to enquire about him, once again. It's your cousin's life, after all! -What are you saying? -What about lights? Lights should be all over the place. I'm thinking, Udaipur. -That's nice. -Perfect! The palace in Udaipur? I want to get married where Priya Dongre got married. I want that too! And special suites for my friends. -That's a given! -Hello sir. -Hello! -Hi. Thank you. Shall I go to the loo and come? -Yeah. -Okay. [humming a Tamil film song] What do you want? Aishu, where are you now? I am with Kedar. Didn't I tell you about him? Then why... Listen! Hey! This is my life! Don't interfere in my life like this. And I trust him! Bye! Where's my phone? Where is it? Phone! Aishu, baby, just let me explain! -I was... -You son of a... -You and your damn.. -Aishu! Hey dude! Thank you! Bloody wretch! Yeah, baby? -I'll call you back, no? -Sir! You've been slapped at the same place, many years ago, right? Get lost! He keeps coming here to get slapped. -Is that so? -Baby! Aishu! He stays at an apartment in Kakkanad, along with a photographer named Jimmy. Varun, right? Do you have any acquaintance by that name here? I need to get acquainted. I need to get acquainted in a way that he can't get up and walk hereafter. Bro, there are CCTV cameras here. Wear your hoodie. Bro, it must have captured our license plate, right? CCTV cameras of Kochi, right? They won't capture anything. Come on! Will this be over before 6 PM? I need to make an offering at my family temple then. Five minutes! We'll beat him to pulp! Six! Seven! Ah! Nice! -Who is Varun? Call him! -Varun? Where is he? Call him! Come out, you! Oh! -Are you an idiot or what? -Hit him! Ask him to come forward. -Hey! Come on! -Should we come there? What's happening here? -What are you looking at? Why have they come here? -Come on! -Who are these guys? -Come on, if you dare! He has tied a towel around his waist. Is he going to hit us now? Kedar, hit him! Kedar, don't keep gaping like you've swallowed a pole. Thrash him! WHAT? WHY? WHO ARE YOU? Why is he just gaping? -Bloody dog! -Kedar! Just a second. -Hey Kedar! -Hey Kedar! Hey! Where are you going? Dude, he's not Varun. He's Arun! Why do we care? Shouldn't we hit him? No! I've known him for a long time! I don't like him one bit! This bloody thing is also not working! Stairs! Where's the stairs? What a buffoon! Shall I go to the temple then? What happened over here now? Did you understand anything? No. Hey Kaali! Tell me, bro! A small matter. What? Matter? Sheesh! It's not that matter. You have to cover a wedding. There's not much of a budget, but the client is someone you know. But you can come alone. That's enough. I'll discuss this with my partner and let you know. Okay. Let me know. Who's the client? The client.... Let it be a surprise! Okay? Thank you so much, Arun. You saved Aishu's life. If you won't mind, may I ask you something? What? Do you like parotta and beef? Huh? Yeah! I'm going to a place which serves awesome parotta, tonight. Do you want to come along? Okay. [Nagumo resumes] This doesn't seem like the usual parotta. This is called Bun Parotta. Madurai style! When are you going to Chennai? Tomorrow evening. -By train? -Yes. Shall I come with you? I'm travelling in a second class compartment. Should I upgrade to an AC coach? Nah! The windows can't be opened. Can't feel the wind either. Second class is fine! Sure! A bit more windy than you expected, right? Good morning! Good morning! Hi kiddo! -Hey! -Bro! -How are you? -Hi. -Who is this, bro? -My friend. -Your friend? Hello. -Hi. -Come on. -Now tell me. -Who's the client? -The client? You've come so far. Now see for yourself. It's my daughter's wedding.

But nobody is there. Lachu Paatti? You want to see her? Hey Arun! -Grandma! -Come on in! Please come. I'm seeing you after so many years! -It's been really long, Grandma! -Don't you remember this grandma? -It's not like that. -As soon as you left after your studies, you forgot this grandma, right? Have I forgotten you? Never! Vijay! -Look who's here! -Hi! -Hi. -Hi. Vijay. Arun. Grandma has told me a lot about you. Okay. Please carry on. I'll see you later. Wait. I'll bring coffee for you. Grandma! Can I get some Sambar Saadham? Wait, I'll bring it. The two of you should always stay together and be happy. Grandma, we're just friends. Oh! Friends, huh? Seems like the two of you are best friends? No. I swear, we're just friends, Grandma. Are you that crazy about him? He's a sweetheart, sis'. You had a boyfriend in college, right? What was his name? Tin? Aluminium? Tinson! -Is this guy like him? -No! He's not like that loser! Back then, he had his eyes on me. That's just your imagination. Okay, agreed. He had his eyes on you. Now, please talk to Papa and Mumma about this. Let me see. Thank you! Wedding photographer? No way! Why not? She is an engineer working at a software company. He's also like that. When he got bored, he quit that and started this. What does he earn by doing this? He earns much more than what you earn in a month, Papa. -Sis'! -Through wedding photography? But it won't work out. There are a thousand still photographers, walking around with cameras. It's an extremely competitive field. If he goes jobless tomorrow, who will take care of her? Why should he take care of me? I can take care of myself. And if he's jobless, I'll take care of him, as well. What? Do you think I can't, Papa? My dear, you don't know how men are! They are really complicated! If they lose their jobs, or if the wife earns more than the husband, they will have all sorts of complexes. It will create huge problems in your family life. -Papa, he's not like you. -He's not? Today's boys are not as problematic as the men from your generation. Now you don't join them and make them like you. Papa... If you say no, I won't marry him. But some other clever girl will definitely snatch him away. If that happens, I will never forgive you, Papa. In case he develops a complex, and it becomes an issue like you mentioned, I won't wait even for a second. I'll get divorced and come back to you immediately. You spoiled brat! What is this? Pampered her, didn't you? Deal with it! Papa! Eventually I'm going to get married. Might as well marry someone I love. Please agree, Papa. Please! -Please? -Please agree, Papa! Agree, Papa! -Please agree. -Do whatever you want! Say it happily! Do whatever you want! A little more! More happiness, Papa! Come on! Marry whoever you want! Awww! Thank you! Thank you, Papa! -Huh? -Oh no! Arun! -My friend Arun is getting married. -God bless him. Same to you! -Hello? -Hey! All set, huh? Bro! Congratulations!

She is okay. It's past 12 AM. Don't you want to sleep? Get some sleep, man! You might not be able to sleep tomorrow. Look at your silly smile! It's raining cats and dogs. I had asked you to book the indoor stadium. Do you ever listen to me? A cricket tournament is going on at the indoor stadium! How come it's raining so much in April? Are you asking me that? Great! Who am I asking! Sorry! A low-pressure area must have formed over the Bay of Bengal. You made me wear this Churidar in the morning. Uncle, it's not a Churidar. It's a Kurta.

Mommy, shall we get married like this? -Won't it be awesome? -In this rain? It will be fine, Uncle. We needn't waste time. What if someone catches a fever?

I checked Darshana's Facebook and Instagram accounts. She has liked and commented on every photo Arun has posted. But she has not liked or commented on even a single photo in which I'm with him. She still has something for him! Don't you have any other job? Have you noticed how he looks at you? No scumbag has looked at me like that, in my whole life. -Just a minute. -Oh! Take your time!

What happened, Arun? What happened? Around 10:30 PM, Nithya started having labour pain. At 11 PM, we brought her to the hospital. Since then, I had been waiting here. Around five minutes back, the nurse came out and asked for me. Then... she placed a tiny little thing into my palms. It's a boy! I've become a father! You're the first person I felt like calling. If I continue talking, I might lose it. I'm hanging up. Darshana! What happened? Arun just had a baby! Even your ex-boyfriend had a baby! When are we going to talk about marriage? Woah! Darshana, answer him! Answer him, Darshana! Come on! Didn't you tell me that... we'll call him by the name that comes to your mind, when you see him? What do we call him? What if you don't like the name I call him? He's our baby! Call him what you like! Selva! Selva! Nice name. Selva Arun. No. Selva Nithya Arun. Thank you! It's nothing, dear. Why has the baby been crying for so long? Give him to me. Let me see. -Come. -He's not crying now. He started crying only now. That's enough. Give the baby to me. Don't cry, dear. You must not feed formula milk to the baby. You must only feed him mother's milk. Can we let the baby starve until she produces milk? Why should you make the baby wear diapers? Ask her to put him on a rubber sheet. If we put him on a rubber sheet, how many times do we clean it? Will she do it? Are you feeding him with a plastic bottle, dear? This is really bad for him. This is not ordinary plastic. It's BPA free. Plastic is plastic! Why don't you take the baby out in the sun in the morning? He needs to get Vitamin D, right? You come and sleep with the baby at night, then. We aren't able to sleep because the baby keeps crying. He has to get enough milk, right? That's why he doesn't sleep. My daughter is feeding him very well. Babies cry! It's the same, all around the world. Can all of you please leave this house? I want to sleep! It's been two days since I slept! What a temper she has! Couldn't you fall in love with a docile girl? If these three women stay here together, you will be done for! That's for sure! What should I do now? I have taken leave for three months. I can take care of my wife and son. I don't need help from anyone! If you don't want it, we don't want it either. You became a father only now, right? -Neelan, control yourself! -No! We won't stay here even for a second longer. Dhanya, go pack our bags! Come on! What are you waiting for? Go and pack our bags! Sorry. Please pack our bags! He'll get it from me. What a performance! You guys should have been in the movies! We should've, right? You should never listen to the advice from your father and father-in-law... about raising a baby. I learned that lesson on that very day. Though they may create a ruckus, with no women in the house, we are doomed! Didn't I tell you not to order it online? -Why can't you buy it from a shop? -I'll buy it right away. Oh God! You've been shopping for so long! Don't you want to come home? Come quickly! I just got into the lift. I'm pressing the button. Baby!!! Please don't cry, baby! My back is aching, Arun! Shall I get you some Amrutanjan balm? Go give it to that ex of yours, you idiot! I'll bring Volini spray. Oh God! I wonder where the Volini is. Oh! Baby! Don't cry, dear. Dude, the trailer of Baahubali 2 is out. Did you watch it? Me? You're asking me? -Hello? -Were you asleep? It's okay. Tell me. What's your opinion about me getting married? What? What's your opinion... about me getting married and starting a family life? Very good opinion! Very, very good opinion! Don't delay it any further. Do it immediately! I haven't seen you in so many years. Arun! I recognized you only when you told me. We had met back in Kerala, right? -How are your kids doing? -They are fine. Bro! Welcome back to Madras! -Thank you! How's it going? -Hey Nithya! How are you? -Was it too much trouble for you? -It's alright. How was his journey? -It was okay. -Woah! He's crying a lot, huh? I'm fed up of these Malayali students who come to Chennai. They get in with a waiting list ticket and ask for seats.. Do you know him? I've seen him somewhere. Where does Darshana stay? Darshana bought an apartment worth 1.5 Crores in Kottivakkam. Her life is set! How does she have so much money? Dude, the reach for her videos is unbelievable. She has so many fans and followers. And she gets paid really well for collaborations too. Shucks! I missed a millionaire, huh? I love you, baby! I love you, baby! -Get lost. -What is this, man? It's nothing, dear. -I don't have a place to stay. -You can stay with me. -Hey! That's Arun! -Hey, yeah! Hello! Didn't you guys go to the hotel? No. He wanted to drop by. [indistinct chatter] We'll take care of the child. We'll bring him soon. -Nithya, they will bring the child. -You guys carry on. He's so cute! -Where's the apartment? -Arun! Arun! -Arun, our baby! -He'll be fine. Come! Arun! Hey! You should have brought it earlier, right? Why do you have to keep everything for the last minute? You're in full form early in the morning itself, huh? -When did you reach? -Just now. I thought I'll see you and head to the hotel. Darshana, Hi! It's so nice to finally meet you! I keep watching all your videos. I mean, I'm a huge fan! That video you shot in Rajasthan, was awesome! Thank you. And what you've managed to do for yourself in just 6-7 years is just amazing! The video you shot in Punjab was so good. -Nithya, that's enough. -Sorry, I'm going on and on. -Must be just excited or something. -Darshana! -Did you see him? -Aww! Awww! He's so cute! He actually looks a bit like Arun, no? Hey! He's crying. Megha, can you hold him please? Just a minute. I'll be right back. -Hey baby! -Aww! Who is this? Who is this? Is this your Papa? ♪ The face, as beautiful As the full moon in the sky ♪ ♪ The mind, as pure and constant As the elixir ♪ Did you have food from outside? -We'll eat from the hotel. -Why don't you eat here? -There's idli and sambar here. -Have you eaten? You look so different in a saree. If your food vlogging fans see this, they will snatch you away! Arun! Did you have food? -No. -Come! Come, come. Everybody, come! Once the function is over... Mom, don't serve him idli. He likes upma. Give him upma. Do you like upma? Yes, I love it. But you never told me that. Does anyone keep telling everyone that they like upma? How's the upma? Yeah! Terrific! Darshana? I need to talk to you. Come to Palavakkam beach. Darsh... Arun! Where are you going? Err.. my friends are partying in another hotel nearby. I'll be back soon. Darshana had called. She said she wants to meet me. Shall I go? Go and come back soon. Do you remember this place? I've been thinking for the past two days, whether I should get married or not. Once I get married, will I lose my freedom? Will I be able to continue working the way I am now? Will I be able to take care of my parents like I am now? Will another person have control over my financial matters? So many things on my mind! And then I was thinking... Vishak is a great guy! I fight a lot with him! But he gets it! He's... He's so understanding. I'm probably overthinking these things, right? Absolutely! Arun, if I had forgiven you during our first year in college, would we be together even now? When you asked me this at the station that day, I didn't have an answer. And do you have an answer now? A few days after my son was born, one morning, I sat down for a while, just looking at the two people lying next to me. There are some moments in life, that make you realize what you're living for. It was a moment like that. There will be a phase like that in your life too. What if it were like this... What if it were like that... You'll stop thinking about all that. You will understand, "This is it!" This is how it's going to be! All this sounds great, but... But I see so many marriages just falling apart, it's... What if these moments you had in your life, don't happen in mine? If they don't, you are doomed! It's your wedding tomorrow! Stop racking your brains, go home and sleep peacefully. It's not tomorrow.
