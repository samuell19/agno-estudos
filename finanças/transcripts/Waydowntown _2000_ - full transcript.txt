[radio]: Ah! - I guess you can't see me rubbing my nipples on the radio. - It's a great visual, Bob. Thanks for that image. - All right, 7:25, CJ92. You know what day it is today? - What? - It's "Start-a-rumour Day." - Oh, is it?! - Start-a-rumour day. You got a rumour you wanna start, get on the phone here, 249-CJ92. Start-a-rumour Day, and I happen to have a couple of rumours here... [radio banter] - Oh, really? - Just a rumour! Just a rumour. - Hell no, we can't go! Hell no, we can't go! You want to start your own rumour there, Joe? - Rumour has it the boss is gonna give me a big raise because of that last rumour. - I like that. - Rumour has it Bob's becoming a vegetarian. - Ha! Ha! Ha! - Oh, that's just a rumour. [mixed radio conversations and background music] - If there's a rumour you wanna share, give us a shout, 249-CJ92, and we'll get to some more rumours right after these. - You got a rumour you want to start? Get on the phone here at 249-CJ92. Look, the phones are just going nuts. We'll take a call here. Hi, CJ. - I heard a rumour... - When I was a kid, I thought it was a pretty bad idea to group all the downtown office towers in one place. My reasoning then was that it made it too easy for the supervillains to pick up the whole of downtown in one big clump and hold it hostage, as supervillains will. You know, shoot it out into space or make it hover over the city with all the underground plumbing and wiring hanging precariously from below. This left it up to the superheroes to come to the rescue and put things back to normal. A scenario most superheroes had to deal with at least once in their career. The thing I never understood was when our superhero managed to save the day, and plop the city back down to earth, everything seemed to go back to normal. As if all the plumbing and wiring and phone lines would just magically get all hooked back up again. - So, ready for your daily grind? - Oh, yeah. - A pun. That was a pun, man. - A pun? - Yeah. Well, I could go for a coffee myself. I'm dying for a cup here. - Knock yourself out. You're living in the land of plenty. - Can't. Not on the job. The boss thinks it looks bad. You believe that? - Really? You'd think it'd look good. - Yeah, well, he's a little... So I gotta wait till my friggin' break and boot it over to Joe Time. - Joe Time? - Yeah. You know, it's better coffee, and it's cheaper, too. - Hmm. - Oh. Hey, listen. I got a joke for you. - I gotta go, man. I'm late. - This is a good one. - I gotta go. Ha! Ha! - This is good, I'm telling you. - It might be fun to be in your office when the downtown is picked up and held in space, high above the planet, under some protective bubble. There'd be tons of battling, looting and raping and so on. Not from the supervillain or his henchmen, but from the inhabitants. The people I work with. Under their calm facade, I think most of these people would love to get back to the jungle. Although you gotta wonder why a superhero would bother saving us, anyway. Superheroes have morals, a sense of honour and decency. So he'd be disgusted by our behaviour and he'd boot the works off into the sun, which would be a shame, considering I'm just getting settled in here. - On course? - Holding fast. - In 24. - Twenty-four. - Headaches? - Headaches. Give me some of that. - You buying lunch? - Maybe. Where? - I don't know. Five? - I don't like Five anymore. - You don't like Five. - I don't know. It's starting to feel like a poor man's Three. - You buy, you decide. - All right. [intercom]: Day 24. Honour system. - Honour system. Will dib, dib, dib, sir. - Dib, dib, dib. - Good morning, Todd. I mean Tom. - Oh, sorry. - Okay. Ugh! Dub, fucking dub. Good morning, boys. Dib, dib, dib, dib, dib. Dib, dib, dib. Dub, dub, dub. Du... Hey, hey, hey! Good morning, Bradley. Is the field trip today? Say, Bradley, I calculated. For me to work here to my retirement in 40-odd years, I'm gonna have to come down here approximately 10,000 times. You've worked here for what, 20 years? That means this is, like, your 5,000th visit. Guy, you're halfway home. Guess you can't go halfway home again. - Sandra West. - Still in? - Yeah, yeah. - Are you sure? - I'm in. I'm in. - Randy's in with a capital "I". - Yeah. Well, remember whose idea it was. What about Curt? - Haven't seen him. What's going on with Vicki? She was all weepy this morning. - Uh, the usual. You know kittens, they're vulnerable. - She still engaged? - It's hard to tell. - Hmm. - Say, are you getting headaches? - Headaches? No. Why? Should I be? - This whole building is one big sealed unit. I mean, the air is recycled. - Tom! Don't put such ideas in my head. - You're absolutely right. You don't want to think about it. It'll drive you nuts. It's not like they start with fresh air. They start with polluted downtown air. - What'd I just say?! Fuck. - Looking for something? - Oh. Brad. I was just... stealing your lunch. Brad, come on. Come on. Your pack almost fell off your desk. I just stood it back up again. The thing they don't teach you in university - and it should be a course, it should be mandatory - is how to work in close proximity to coworkers that you have nothing in common with. And who you may, in fact, dislike. Having to work elbow to elbow with someone like "Sadly, I'm Bradley" here requires training. You need to appear friendly and personable, even if it goes against your natural instincts. Even if your natural instincts would have you lean toward rudeness. - Hey, Dinkus. Found one of your little friends crawling across my desk. - And so... you killed him? - Listen, Dinkus. I want to ask you something. Just between you and me, okay? - Sure. What? - What I'm finding hardest about all this, and I'm sure you're struggling with it too, is, uh... Well, I'm not getting any. If you know what I mean. And I'm having a pretty hard time arranging for any. - Aren't you engaged? - No juice until we're married. - You're kidding. - Scout's honour. - Well, how do you... you know, how do you cope? - Oh. Strictly a one-sided arrangement. I could never do that. - Wait a sec. You and her aren't, but you and other women... - Are. Yeah. - Well, how do you know she isn't also? - What do you mean? All right. Listen, Dinkus. The way I see it, Randy has absolutely no self-respect. So he's probably jerking away himself. Sandra's a block of ice. She's not even a factor. But my question is, Dinkus, what are you doing? Not embarrassing yourself, are you? - I'm using a little dope. It takes the edge off. - Hold on a second. Dope? That's not allowed. That's in the rules, right? - There's no rule. - That's not fair. If you're half-baked all the time, you're just gonna cruise all the way to the finish line. [chortling] - There's no rule about dope. - That's fucking cheating. - Retard. - Tom. Tom! You got a minute? - Millions. - Is he listening to music? - Mm-hmm. - You're picking up Mr. Mather's gift, right? - I guess, yeah. - I phoned. It's ready. Birks. It's paid for. Just pick it up. Ask for David in Collectibles. - Okay. Why am I picking this up? - I'm not a trainee anymore. It's a trainee's job. - Wait a second. You're not a trainee anymore? - Practically speaking, I'm still in training. But officially, I'm no longer a trainee. - When do I get to be not a trainee officially, but not practically, speaking? - Ask Mrs. Drysdale. - Check with the "Clivesdale". So you don't run errands anymore? - No, I'll run errands. Just not gift-running errands. - Do I have to wait till it's lunch? - You'll have to ask Mrs. Clives-- I mean, Drysdale. Mrs. Drysdale! - Okay. Forget about it. - No, no, no. It's good to ask. Tom's running a gift errand during his lunch. He'd like to know if it's company policy to leave early for lunch to make up for the time lost. He's picking up Mr. Mather's retirement gift. - And I was just wandering if-- - Gift! The origin of the word, from "to give". Mr. Mather started this company from nothing, 56 years ago. He has given over half his life for this company. He is the sole reason you are gainfully employed by this company. Are you prepared to give anything beyond the five months you've been with this organization, Mr. Bennett? Good. You can start by giving up a portion of your lunch hour to pick up a retirement gift for the founder of this company. How does that sit with you? - Uh, fine. - And you know what you have to do. - Yes, of course. You should really check with her on your trainee status. - Yeah, some other time. - You're going down? - Hey! - Hey. - How are you doing, man... Vicki Strayhorn. - Strayhorn... Yeah, that's an idea. I don't usually like to dip my pen in company ink, but in this case, I'll make an exception. Right, Dinkus? - She's vulnerable. - Really. - Hmm. - Shit. Shit, shit, shit. I missed him. - Ah! [Curt]: What the fuck?! [chuckling] - What? - Is it supposed to show? - Oh. I don't know anymore. - So what's with Mather? - Oh, you know. His thing. - His thing? - You don't know? - No. - Well, they like to keep it a little quiet. It's kind of an embarrassment to the firm. - Yeah? - He's like a serious clepto. - What? - Yeah. Someone has to keep an eye on him during lunch in case he picks something up, like shoplifts. - And that's you? - I have to follow him around to see if he, you know, swipes something. Today is my first day. - Ha! Ha! Ha! It's way better than gift errands. - He founded the company. - Yes, he did. Yes, he did. So what if he, like... what if he, like, steals something? - Well, if you ask him and he gives it to you, you return it. But sometimes, he gets a bit weird, or a bit weird-violent, so you let him keep it. And then, you pay for what he took. And then, they reimburse you in petty cash. What's wrong? - You don't know? - Don't start. - What are you talking about? - Remember. Birks. David in Collectibles. - Oh, my God. - Fuck off with that. - There's the four of us in on the bet. Randy, Sandra, Curt and myself. The deal is who can go the longest without going outside? The four of us all live in apartments attached to the downtown core. We stay in our apartments at night and in the office by day. This is made easy since the downtown clump is all connected by walkways. You could probably spend years at work without even going down to street level. In theory, we could go without fresh air till we retire. We've each got a month's salary on this misguided challenge. Winner takes all. Ten thousand dollars. Plus an odd sense of accomplishment. Why attempt something this juvenile? Well for Randy and me, I guess we are juvenile. Sandra? I think for her, it's a team-spirit thing. I think she had second thoughts after she realized the team was just us bottom-feeders. Now her competitive nature is taking over. Curt? Curt's got something wrong with him. And a... and a slice. - What kind? - Uh... Hawaiian. - We don't have Hawaiian. - Could I have a straw, please? - Okay. Ham and pineapple. - There you are, sir. Enjoy your lunch. - Thank you. Aloha. Mm... - "I'm sick of Five. It's just a poor man's Three." -I got a hit. Look at this. It's so sad really. - "I may have lost it as you say, but you're starting to turn the wrong way. You'll be following me down someday." What's this? - The guy's fucking pathetic. - Who's it from? - "Sadly, I'm Bradley." - Bradley. He's been acting odd, don't you think? - Fucked is more accurate. - He's asking for help. - I don't know. I don't think about him. I don't notice him. I just share an office with him. - You're buying, right? - No. - You said you were buying. - You said I was buying. It's completely different. - What's gotten into you, guy? I mean, maybe Brad's right. - You with her? - What? - You know her? - Yeah. Actually, yes. I do. She's my girlfriend. - Your girlfriend. - Yeah. - Your girlfriend. - Hey. Hey. Guy, hey. Come on. Hey, I was just kidding. Okay, run. Randy, did you see the girl on the phone? - No. - You know where she went? - No idea. - Fuck. - Ohh! - Ohh... Oh, God! - What's going on? - Oh, God! Oh, God. Look! - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Who would do something like that? - Okay. - Oh, God. - Some people go just a little too far, don't they? - That is... so gross. Oh, God. - You're not at lunch. - Uh, month end. - Month end. Right. - Oh, God. I have to go wash my hand. - Okay, I'll take care of this. - Curt's done this before. - What? What's he done? - In university. At Carlton, they have a tunnel system that connects the buildings to the residence. And get this. Curt Schwin went a full year. Undisputed champ. - Who told you this? - I don't think I could go a year. - A year? - That's what I heard, a year. Thompson's a couple of years behind him. Apparently, there's still a bit of a cult of Curt there. - A year? Fuck that. He's disqualified. I never would've gotten into this if I'd known that. He cheated. - We asked him, remember? - He lied. He withheld information. - Not really. I'd kind of heard. But not really and... I didn't think it was so wrong. - You knew? Are you fucking out of your mind? A year? A year? I dunno if I can go 30 days, let alone a year. - You said Curt couldn't stay out of the pickup circuit for more than a week. - It's true. Fuck. Fuck! I just gave him Vicki Strayhorn. Give me a fucking quarter. - For you, not likely. - Randy, the guy is struggling. If he nails Vicki, he'll be good for months. Years. Give me a fucking quarter! Thank you - champ! [dring!] - Curt Schwin. - Curt? - Hey, Dinkus. You phoning Vicki to put in a good word for me? - A year? - Oh, yeah. Them's the good old days. Listen, Dinkus. Thanks for the pet. It worked like a "charmsky." [sniffing] Oof! [computer]: One giant leap for man... and one small step for man, one giant leap for, for, for... - Excuse me, Miss. I was, uh, watching you on the phone. In the food fair? - Uh-uh. I have a boyfriend. - Yeah, I know. You see, that's just it. I was watching you on the phone and some guy comes up to me and he asks me if I know you. And I told him that I did. Even though, of course, I don't So, uh... - And? - He got kinda in a... in a funk. He had on, like, this blue shirt. He had curly hair. I was trying to straighten it out. Not the hair, but the situation. - Okay, so you said that you knew me. - Uh, yeah. Like... like... but joking, you know. - Yeah. Joking like how? - Uh, I kind of told him that you were my girlfriend. - You told my boyfriend that I was your girlfriend? - I might of, yeah. - How upset was he? - I don't know. He ran... he ran away. So... - Hey, have you seen these? [muffled screaming] Okay, it's your turn. - Is that what this is for? - Yeah. You gotta try it. - You just, uh... - You're supposed to scream. - Yeah, I don't really feel the need. - Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Come on! Come on, come on! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Where's that guy? - Who? What? Oh, despondent boy? I don't know. He just got up and went inside. - Really? - Yeah. - I thought he might've-- - Jumped? - Yeah. - No. I told him he couldn't lay there, so he got up and went inside. - Wow. I totally thought-- - He jumped. Right? - Yeah. - No. From where, really? You'd have to get up on the roof or break a window. That's harder than it sounds. The roof's all secure, so you can't get up there. And breaking a window, that's tough too. You can't really break that glass. A few months back, a guy used a pop bottle filled with marbles; just broke the window with it and pff... - I gotta go. - Sure you do. - Mather Mather & Mather. How can I help you? I wish you wouldn't say sorry. Please say "pardon me" or "excuse me." You're using the word incorrectly. Try and remember for next time. Do you say "sorry" when you mean "pardon me" or "excuse me"? - Sorry. What? Uh, no. I... Oh, I guess I obviously do, yes. - Sandwich? - Sure. [breathing heavily] So, uh, how's Pete? - Pete? - Fiancé Pete? Or do you have a couple of fiances waiting in the wings? - No. No, no. Just... just one. Pete. - So how is Pete, anyway? - Pete... he's... he's fine. Fine. - How long has it been? The, uh, engagement? - Oh... two years. - Two years? It's a long time. Why so long? - To save money for the wedding, I guess. I don't really know. I guess... To see if we like it, I guess. - To see if you like being engaged. - Yeah. Well, no. No, no. Not engaged. Married. To see if we like being married. Sort of, like... a test. A test run. - And after two years, you decide, "Yes, we liked being engaged." Or, "No, we did not like being engaged." And if you do like being engaged, then... why shouldn't you just keep being engaged? Why tamper with bliss? Now, if you didn't like being engaged, then you'll have to consider moving to a state of... "non-engagedness." Get married, or... split up. [sighing] Two years. - Aren't you engaged? - Well... yeah. - So, uh... So we're both engaged. - Yep. - How long? - Two years. [bang!] - All right. A guy jumps from a window and kills himself. So he didn't, but I thought he did. And I stayed inside because of a bet. That's gotta fuck with your sense of yourself. I've only been working down here for five months. And already, I'm starting to turn. Maybe Brad's right. Maybe I am turning. God, I think I'm becoming completely desensitized. Am I some kind of a monster? An abnormality? A psychopath of some kind? They say that a hallmark of psychopathic behaviour is fake charm. turning it on for stuff you don't like. Sometimes, I think my job now is saying hello and making small talk around the office. I wonder how many times a day I say hello. There's all that stuff about kids seeing 8,000 TV murders before they're, like, four. But hello is worse. It's become meaningless. It's a con. A way to trick us into thinking we're engaged in human interaction. I could be saying hello to a plant or my ant farm. Last week, these two intense suits were walking, like, full speed. And they knocked heads right in front of me. They both landed flat on their backs. It was like I was watching it on TV. One guy was knocked out cold. I didn't even break stride. I might as well have said hello. - Have you seen Mather? - Uh... - I found him and I lost him. This isn't good. It's the day of his retirement party. What if he gets arrested or something? God, I'm doomed. - Okay. So, what? - I think he knows he's being followed. He's sneaky and he's fast. Oh! He's fast. - Where was the last time-- - It'd be just my luck if he got caught. Where's the present? - Present? - Mather's present? - Right. I'm just... I'm on my way. - If you spot him, let me know. Okay? You keep an eye on him. You call me on my cell and let me know where he is. . Okay. - You look kinda out of it. - Some nasty shit going on. - How so? - I dunno. You know, I don't know if I've been myself lately. Or maybe I have. - Hey, shit. Check out this monitor right here. This'll align your plane. There we go. Right on. Come on, come on, come on. Jesus... It's amazing how often that happens, you know. It's like they have a sixth sense or something. - Is that new? - Yeah. It's a ton of fun. - Okay. Listen. Do I seem different to you? - I don't know. Like what? - Cold. Removed. Do I seem cold or removed? - I always thought that was in your job description. - That old guy. Where is that? - Huh? - That's my boss. We've been looking for him. - Ah. Busted! - Oh, fuck. No, no, no, no. Phil. Phil, let me... Let me take this. Okay? - Sure. Slap his hand for me. - Yeah, I'll handle it. Il n'y a plus dans cette ville la joie qu'il y avait avant Downtown Je suis perdue dans cette ville sans toi toi qui m'aimais pourtant Downtown je m'en vais seule au long des rues retrouver le passé d'un amour qui n'existe plus mais qui a commencé dans cette ville j'ai beau chercher mais plus rien j'ai beau chercher dans les rues mais pourtant c'est en vain tu sais Downtown comme on s'aimait oh oui... [dring!] - Sandra West. - I found him. In the men's washroom. Behind Something Significant. - Oh, good. Where? - Something Significant. The store. - Where is that? What is that? - The store. - Okay, okay, okay. - Fuck. Mr. Mather? Mr. Mather, can I have the bag, please? Look, it's not your bag... sir. It's not yours. So, uh... could I... have it? Please? - Is he in there? - Yes. All you have to do is be polite. - Is he in there? - Yes, he's in there. He stole this. I wouldn't walk around with it or anything. He took it off some guy in the mall. - What am I supposed to do with this? - It's so stifling in here. - Don't do that. - What? - You talked me into this bet. So don't go playing with my brain, okay? It's being played with enough. And where is Mather's present? - Okay, okay. I'm going right now. By the way, you're welcome. So what do you get the boss who's stolen everything? I guess once you don't have to worry about the day-to-day monotony of making a dime, you can get bored. Your mind wanders to other things. Maybe problematic things like shoplifting. I guess you could be doing worse things: dismemberment things, drunk-driving things. I mean, it's not like you kill someone every lunch hour. But is that where this leads? That's my question. I mean, God! The fish stinks from the head down, right? Am I the tail? Am I starting to smell? - Hey, guy. Listen. You gotta hear this one. It's brilliant, I'm telling you. - Hey, guy. Guy. No. Hey. Hi. How is he? - Who? - Your boy-- - I'm so jittery. Do I seem jittery? I am super hyper-sensitive right now. Can you tell? - I wanted to apologize. About what I said to your boyfriend. I mean, it's scary, isn't it? It's scary what can happen. I mean, one false move and you can throw a whole lot of things out of whack. - You know what? It's not a big deal. Where'd you go? I looked all over. - Uh, I... I lost you. Son of. Listen. How is he? - I didn't find him. God, look at these. The colours for fall. Yuck! - Uh, so... Your boyfriend, how is he? - Oh, he's fine. - So... you think he's okay? - Oh, no. He's so fine. Paul is one of the happiest guys. Around here, anyway. - Happy. He doesn't seem very happy. - Oh no. You know what he does for a living? He delivers flowers. Everybody loves getting flowers, right? Your lips are kissable. Anyways, I'm breaking up with him. - You're breaking up with him? Do you think that's a... a good idea? - I really need to calm down. You wouldn't happen to have any dope on you, would you? - No. - No. - No, I don't have any dope. Listen. I have to run this errand for work. Afterwards, I could talk to him. Or right now. What do you think? - He works at Floral Arrangements. I really need to calm down. - Okay. I have some pot in my car. - Really? - Yes. In my car. - Well, let's go to your car. - I have to run-- get this gift. - Get the gift. And then, we'll go to your car. - Okay, we could do that. - So what's that worth? - $3,500. - You know, I read somewhere that infidelity actually is healthy for relationships. - Really? - Especially for engagements. - Where did you read that? Playboy? - Actually, I think it was Playboy. But I'm being deadly serious. Plus, it's not like we're married or anything. - No, of course. We're... What? - What what? - What you just said. - What did I just say? What did you hear? - You were getting at something. - No. No. Did you hear something? - No. It sounded like something. - You know, I'm innuendo-free. Had all my shots. - I've... I've... I've... I'm sorry. I just... I have to... I've gotta get this to... - What do you think I suggested? [dring!] Hello. - Curt? Christ. - Make it fast, Dinkus. I'm lining up the game-saving play here. - Okay, listen to me, Curt. Listen to me. You're using a coworker in a less-than-honourable way. And for what? For what? A stupid bet. Principles, man. Think principles. - Oh, come on, Bennett. I've seen you work. You're far less principled than I am. - So... So where... where were we? - Oh. I, uh... I think you were suggesting something... but you couldn't come right out and say it. [laughing] - Did you see that guy? Those guys never step aside. It's like you're not even there. - They ignore-- - The rules. I know. Oh. Listen first, talk later. Right? - Are you gonna sit? - I can't. I'm working. So, how's that, uh... How's the bet? - It's good. I mean, it's fine. I'm sticking in there. I mean, I'm keeping really-- - Focused. Yeah, I can see that. - Well, as focused as I can be, you know-- - Under these conditions, for sure. - You're doing it again. - Finishing your sentences. Sorry. - You know, once you settle into the routine, it's easy. I think I'm doing pretty good, too. This thing doesn't even affect me. - I, uh... I work for Mather Mather & Mather. - Three Ms. - Mm-hmm. Soon to be two. - Oh, yeah? You got a degree of some kind? - Commerce. - Ah, yeah? You like it? - I dunno. I'm just getting started. - How's the atmosphere up there? Is it all fresh and clean? - It's pretty good. It's... Whoa. - What? - Nothing. - I don't know if this is such a good idea. - Don't worry about it. Just read the names on the button and transfer the calls to that person by pushing that button. - Ha. Ha. - What's wrong? - I was... just thinking about what happened to your boyfriend, Paul. - I don't know a thing about it. - No, wait. No, no, no. Listen. Listen. See, when you went outside, when I lost you, I didn't actually... I didn't actually, like, lose you. I'm in this stupid fucking bet with some of the people I work with. Okay. And I can't... I can't go outside. - Oh, that's too bad. Your lips are so kissable. Wait a minute. For all you knew, Paul could've jumped to his death. And you don't go outside 'cause of some bet? - No, no, no, no. - What kind of guy are you? God! - Hey, no, no, no. Come on, wait. No. Ah! - Where's the present? - Oh, fuck! [Kathy]: There are two kinds of people in the world: good people and bad people. There's no in-between. I have the vase. I'm gonna go talk to Paul at Floral Arrangements. Meet me there. - I can't do this. I... I... - I know. Me neither. I... I shouldn't be... It's just... - I can't do this. I can't do this. - Me neither. Me neither. Me neither. - Oh, my God. Oh, Curt. Oh! Oh wait. Wait. My foot. Ah! [toilet flushing] - Hey. Hey, you dropped something. Hey! We all have to live here, you know! Or work here. Fuck. Shit. [inhaling deeply] - Can I help you? - Yeah. Uh, I'm supposed to meet someone. What's he doing? - He's just... standing in there. He just had a fight with his girlfriend. - Do you know where she is? - She left a little while ago, then he went and stood in there. I gotta get in there 'cause I got orders to fill. No, wait. I wouldn't do that if I were you. He... he can be a little bit... vigorous. Not vigorous, but violent. - Violent? - He's been a little bit like this before. But not exactly. - Hey, guy. What's his name? - Paul. - Hey, Paul... Uh, so listen... Your girlfriend told me I should come up here and clear up the whole... misunderstanding about what... what happened in the food fair. Because, uh... It was a misunderstanding, man. What I said to you, it was a joke. Just a joke. I'd never met your girlfriend before. I didn't really know her. And I still don't... know her. - You still don't know her. - No. No, no, no. I just met her. Just recently. You know, trying to clear this whole mess up. And... and, uh... Because you ran, man. You took off. And then, I looked for you. And then, I couldn't find you or anything. You know what, guy? You know what? Maybe, uh... Maybe, uh, this is none of my business, but... I was thinking that maybe it's time to move on. I mean, you know, maybe... things aren't really working out between you two. - How would you know? - Listen, did Kathy leave this here for me? 'Cause, uh... Okay. You know what? That's kind of a present for... Hey, you know what? How would I know? How would I know? You're right. I mean, I don't know what's going on between you two. Maybe all you need is just, you know, to work at it a little bit harder. It's obvious to me that something special is going on between you two, because she really was worried sick about you. - She told you that? - I could tell by the way she was acting. - How was she acting? - Well, you know, uh... worried. - Worried? - Super worried. Guy... it's obvious to me that she really cares about you. - She just told me she wants to break up with me to go out with you. - She said that? [glass breaking] - I'm just gonna... - Cut it out! Stop! [sobbing] - Kathy! - He's normally not like this. - Okay. Paul, that's it. Your break is over! - Fuck off! - Ahhh! - Okay. So basically, you're telling me your insurance doesn't cover this. - No. Well, sure it would. If we broke it. - Right. I don't suppose we could pretend that you broke it. - That's not going to happen. - No. Of course not. Of course not. - Sorry. - I know where he is and I haven't forgotten. - Tortoise. - You know, I was reading this book. It was called... - You wanna sit? - Can't. I'm working. Ooh, moose, baby, moose. I was reading this book. It was called... Crime. Well, yeah, it's not the same title. It's Crime and... they get away with it. They don't get punished. - Maybe it's called Crime and Getting Away With It. - It's not called that. Hey, speaking of small-mall fast... - You all right? - Yeah, yeah. I'm great. - Great? - Great. - You sure you're all right? - You know, you look a little pale. - Pale? - Maybe you should try doing some fast walking. - Or try doing some stairs. Yeah. Oh, that'll help oxygenate your blood. - You think my blood needs oxygen? - Just a thought. - Did Tom tell you to tell me that about my blood? - No. - Listen, don't fucking worry about me, okay? I can hold my own. [dring!] [dring!] Hello. Hello. Hi, Mrs. Clivesdale. Mm-hmm. - I'm not stepping aside anymore. I'll share the ground. But for those who won't give way, I'm standing firm. These, these are my rules. - Do you think there's something wrong with me? I've been having trouble concentrating lately when I read. I have to go back and reread pages because... I can't concentrate. - What was that? - See, that's the great thing about books. If you're not paying attention, you can go back and reread what you missed. But with conversation, you have to pay attention the first time. - I'm here. Where are you? - You tell me. - Okay. I'll write that down. There's an engraved plaque that needs to be picked up right away from Trophyco. Here's the address. - Why me? - 'Cause Mrs. Drysdale mentioned you specifically. - Hey, wait a minute! Hey, where is this? Hey, this is outside! - Is that the way it's supposed to work? - Come on! It's Tom you want, not me. Oh, God! - No. Behind you. Behind you. - Mather & Mather. Sorry. & Mather. Mather Mather & Mather. Listen, everybody's off at lunch. Can you phone back when people are here? - Who is this? - I'm having trouble with the phone system. Could you call back in a few minutes, please? - I don't think I have a few minutes. Where's June? - She went to the washroom a while ago. I don't know what she's doing. Actually, I got a good idea. I'm sorry. - The phone system is simple. I'm gonna tell you what to do. Okay? - I got it, I got it, I got it! - Okay. Sorry. Oh, God! Okay. - I'm not saying competition is a bad thing. Okay? Certainly, it's got its good points. I mean, you don't want to turn out like "Sadly, I'm Bradley" or anything. - Sadly, I'm Bradley. - Yeah. It's pretty funny, huh? - Sadly, I am Bradley. - Brad, hi. Listen. The receptionist must've-- - Made a mistake. - Yeah. - Well, maybe you'd like to talk to me instead? - I kinda got... - Did you, uh, read my note? - I haven't always been selfish and uncaring. I haven't. I mean, I was a boy scout. I cheated on a few badges, yeah. But basically, I was a good scout. It must be the air. Inside with all these people, breathing the same air. The very idea just isn't right. - Fuck it! I lost him again! - Isn't he, like, 80? - I think he likes it. I think it's a big game to him. He ducks down and he runs. He fucking runs! But I don't care. Let him get nabbed. Is it my problem? It's not in my job description, is it? Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it. Forget him. - Are you feeling okay? - Fine. Fine. Can you believe this? - Staying inside for a month is sort of like the buzz you have the day after a night of heavy drinking. You feel crappy and hung over. But underneath that, you're still a little drunk and light-headed. Which can kind of compensate for the hangover. - Mather Mather & Mather. - Hey, guy. How are you doing? Listen, I need you to do me a little favour, okay? - Vicki and Curt. Yeah, they just went by. - One, two, three. One, two, three. - Oh, God. - It's the ladies' bathroom. [moaning and groaning] - Ow! [toilet flushing] Curt, wait, wait, wait. - Sounds like something's going on. - What kind of something? - You know, something something. - I need you to stop them. - Stop them! - Make a noise. Do something. - But it's the ladies bathroom. - Come on, knock on the door! - I can't. - Do it! Knock on the door. Loud! Knock loud! [barking] - It's written here on the bathroom stall, and I quote, "Curt Schwin is a slut." - Okay, well, what did he say? - No can do. He says you have to sign for it. - So get what I have to sign and bring it back here. I'll sign it. You take it back to him. - I tried. The guy's super stubborn. - Oh, man! So this is how I'm gonna go out. All because a stupid engraved-- - Plaque. I know. What? Look. I don't know what to say, all right? - You don't know what to say? How would you? You're a fucking security guard. Look, I'm sorry. Honest. - That's what it said. "Slutty, slutty, slutty." [barking] - Look here, Mr. Mather. I'm sure you find this pretty fucking funny, scurrying around the aisles on your hands and knees, but I don't What are you looking at? Is there an old man crawling all over your feet over there? He's like eighty-fucking-five years old and he's got this twisted expression on his face. Like a smirk. A fucking smirk. Security, please. - Glasswares. They have really nice glasswares. - No, you don't understand. I saw myself. There's blood everywhere. - You know, you're lucky I'm a forgiving guy. - I said I was sorry. I'm not feeling well. - I can get in a lot of shit for this. - You'll be back in two minutes. - Hello. - Yeah. What? - Code 38. - Yeah. I'll be right there. - Hey! You're looking a little out of it. - Thanks. - Okay, now here goes. What is the difference between the 15 bus and a bottle of marbles? - I don't know. What's the difference? - The 15 takes you downtown, a bottle of marbles takes you way down town. A bottle of marbles, man, takes you way down town. I made that up. - I don't get it. - Come on, man. The joke is not gonna fly if you don't know the reference. All right? It's what the workers use to break out of their office windows, you know? Pfff... splat! It's like, what, the third time in the last month? You know what it is? It's like the new fad for depressed execs. - They say you don't always see it coming. But the first time I met Brad, I thought, "this is the kind of guy that's gonna jump out a window." Hey. Hey! What? - One, two, three. One, two, three. - Hi, Todd. - Tom. - One, two, three. - Bradley... Bradley... Come on. Come on. Come on, Brad. Bradley. Come on, Bradley. Come on, man. Bradley. Come on, Bradley. [knocking] - Phil? - All right, there you go. Listen to me. Guy, I'm so sorry for not seeing the signs. Why don't we... put some of this... whoa, on your... Ow. Ow. How is it? How's your head? Listen to me. You're in a bit of turmoil. I see that. I see that, man. You know, you got yourself into something... a career, say, that is... that's leaving you cold. Right? But guy, you're like what, forty. Forty? I mean, your life is only half over. I mean, you have half your life to live. Right? I don't really know what I'm saying here, Brad. Okay. Listen to me. I won't pretend I know what's going on in your head. I'm not saying I have anything to say that would change your mind. I mean, fuck, who am I to be telling you what you should or shouldn't be feeling. Right? Or doing about how you're feeling? Brad, could you... could you hold on one second? Okay. Mr. Mather. Uh, Mr. Mather. Hi. What do you have there? Listen. Can I... can I have it? Come on. Please? Okay. Yes. Thank you. Thank you, sir, very much. Okay. So where were we? - Who are you to tell me what I should or shouldn't be feeling or doing about what I'm feeling? - I know, Brad. You're absolutely right. - That's what you were saying. - What? - That's what you just finished saying. - Oh, right. Right. Okay. Yeah. So listen to me. You might've thought this out and figured out that this might be the best thing for you. And it might be. I mean, how do I know, right? But all I'm saying is... I'm not leading up to some really big point here, but I'm just saying that lately, I've been seeing things in me that have totally surprised me. I mean, I'm a nice guy. I'm a nice guy. But this place... this place has been playing some mean fucking tricks on me. And I guess what I was thinking is that, Bradley, maybe all you need is a change of scenery. I guess what I'm getting at is, you know, uh... things have happened to me lately that have surprised me about myself, and that I have to thank you, Brad, in some small way, or maybe even in a big way, I have to thank you. So, thank you. You're looking at me and you're thinking, "Why should I be listening to this fuckhead, this selfish self-centred... - Cruel. - Cruel. Oh man, really cruel? - Very cruel. - Okay. Cruel. - Yeah. - Okay. Paul. Hi. Oh. You brought the... I'll sign for those. They're for my boss. Listen, Paul, I want to thank you for what you did for me. Earlier this afternoon. You know, straightening me out and everything. I mean... guy, I deserved much worse than that. What I did, it was inexcusable. Those... those aren't mine, Paul. They're for the boss. But you know, feel free to do that if that's, uh... what you want to do. Guy, you know what you need? You need to sit down. You need to sit down. That's right. You sit down. Relax. I'm gonna take these from you. You know something, Paul? These things... they happen in life. But the best way to deal with them is just to move on. Right, Brad? Aw, Paul. Paul, I hear you, man. I really do. You know something? You and Brad might have a lot in common. Can I borrow this? - Have you seen him? - Yeah. He just came in a couple of minutes ago. - Was he clean? - Uh, yeah. - You sure? - Yeah, pretty sure. - Here. Sign this. - Why? He doesn't even know who I am. - Oh, yeah. I'm out. - You're out? - The bet. So's Randy. - You're out? - I'd just like you to know, Tom, I hope you can sleep at night after all you've done. Your little mind games worked like a charm. You got your way. You're a winner. - Hey. Hey, you take that back! You take that back. I am not a winner! I guess everyone has those days that change the way you look at things. Maybe this is one of those days. Although usually, you're probably not aware of the mechanics that have changed the way you look at things that day. You probably can't put your finger on the exact moment your life changed in a small or big way. Of course, in the movies, lives can change dramatically over a short period of time. Even over the course of a lunch hour. - I've been thinking about you all day. Maybe we've been engaged long enough. Maybe we should just do it. Huh? - Tom. Get down here and help, will you? - All right. Farewell. Good luck. Brad... Bradley. You know, that thing that Neil Armstrong said when he went to the moon? "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"? Well, if you're thinking about going out a window from up here, it's the other way around. And I don't think that's your intention. [computer]: It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. [Star-Spangled Banner] - Vicki. - Yeah? - These are for you. - You're giving these to me? These are for me? You're giving these to me? - Thanks, Vicki. - Is there something...? - Thank you. [big tremor] - Todd. The elevators aren't working 'cause the power's out. Phones are out, too. - So this is it. We're gonna dangle in space for who knows how long. Hell, who'd care if I've quit or not. The basic fabric of civilization is about to break down. Nobody's gonna be working. It's probably already started. People are probably already terrorizing each other. They'll think it's the end. The apocalypse. The last blast. Oh, man, I should've gotten out sooner. Here I was, turning a new leaf, making the big change. And now it's too late. I guess everyone will handle it in their own way. Breakdowns. Suicides. Denial. Some of us will be contemplative, others homicidal. How do I react? Where do I stand when it all breaks down? Am I the voice of reason, or do I start breaking windows? The air would get pretty stale in the bubble if the downtown were lifted high above the city. It would probably become a drag pretty fast, despite all the wanton- destruction possibilities. Not that that's the direction I would take. I wonder what a superhero would think of my decision to opt out of this particular career path? Would he approve of my actions? I guess you have to trust your instincts. Even if they are a little cloudy. Or in my case, really cloudy. So I bailed on my first job out of college and there's probably not much chance of getting a reference letter. A reference letter would only refer me down here, anyway. Downtown. Too bad it couldn't refer me to another world, say, or another planet. Somewhere where everyone behaves the way you think they should. [inhaling deeply]
