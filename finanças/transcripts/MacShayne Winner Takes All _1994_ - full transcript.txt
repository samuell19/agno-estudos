(carnival music) (people chattering) (tense music) (clown laughing) (sirens wailing) (light music) - [Man] Raise 500. - Ooh. You boys play a mighty racy game in this part of the country, don't ya? - In or out? - Like my old daddy said. Can't win if you're not in. - [Dealer] Cards? - One. - Hell, I'll just play these boys, see how far they take me. - 2000. - More money than my old daddy made in a whole year. - In or out? - Well, it's like my old daddy said. Can't taste the milk if you don't pull the teet. - Kings and sevens. - You know, I'd have bet money that's what you had. - Beat 'em. - All I got's two small pair, but they're both alike. - Four deuces? Four deuces? - Gentlemen, ladies. We have to shut this table down for a while. If you'll follow me, I'll be more than happy to place you in another game. (light music) - That's quite a system you boys got. You need a seven, you put out seven chips. You need a three, you put out three, and then you deal from the bottom, you must really think I'm stupid. - Who the hell are you? - MacShayne, hotel security, and if you ever so much as fly over the state of Nevada again, you're looking at jail time, and I promise you this, you won't like the food and you really won't like the company. (light music) - Listen, MacShayne-- - Every casino in the state of Nevada's closed to you for the rest of your life, pal. Can you imagine? Them boys wanting to cheat me at poker. (mysterious music) - Miss Evans, can I have your autograph? - Buzz off. Next car. - Mr. MacShayne, Miss Foss has been trying to reach you all morning. - Really, where is she? - She's in her office. - Good. - No, no, her office is the other way. - I know. - Miss Foss isn't going to like this. - That's even better. (light music) - [Ellen] Hi, this is Ellen I can't get to the phone now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you. (phone beeps) - Hi Ellen, this is Jack, your husband. Jack, your ex-husband, I guess. How many messages do I have to leave you before you call me back? Look, I am sorry that I missed you in Las Vegas while you were there, I promise you it wasn't my fault. Matt's birthday is coming up, and I would really really like to see him, and I have a surprise for you. I got your car back. I won it in a poker game. If you'd just let me bring... (phone beeps) - You rat, you fig, you double-dealing slime! You said Ozzy was on his death bed! - He was! - He met me at the airport! - He couldn't wait to see you! - 30 reporters! And he didn't let me get a word in edgewise! (shouting indistinctly) It was like we were married all over again! The Ozzy Evans Show, with Cindy the puppet, the stooge! - [Harvey] Cindy, for god's sakes, (muffled shouting)! - [Cindy] I'm not his stooge anymore, Harvey! I'm a star! A star, dammit! I've got three platinum albums! They're playing all my videos on MTV! All of my concerts are sold out, Harvey! And what's he been doing, huh, what?! Playing laundromat! That's what-- - No no no no. - Who are you?! Let go of me! Ouch! How dare you! Let me go! Harvey! Harvey, let me go! - John J. MacShayne, hotel security. I've been assigned to you and your ex-husband, to protect you. - Harvey Pell, Cindy and Ozzy's manager. She's not making those little gurgly sounds anymore, she's gonna be fine now. - Oh, god! (Cindy shouts) - Why don't you stop being such a prima donna. - Prima donna. - Prima donnas throw ashtrays, you're a singer. Your contract's two weeks, surely you can do that. - Beautifully said, succinct, to the point. Truncheon, almost. - Shut up, Harvey! I'll get through it, all right? - You know, there's a chance you might even like it. - Don't push it, MacBayne. - MacShayne. (light music) Wait, wait, wait! These are my things, where are you going? - Storage. - Hey, what the hell is going on here? - Who are you? - MacShayne, John J.. - ID? - You got it. - Yeah, what do you want? - My room back. - Let him up, boys. He's one of ours. - Next time don't come blasting through like that, all right? We've had death threats against the special prosecutor. You could wind up with a bullet between your teeth. - Franklin Carter. I'm sorry to just commandeer your suite, Mister? - MacShayne. - MacShayne, MacShayne, but it was a last minute thing. I was all set to prosecute a labor racketeer ring case up in Reno, and the defense got a change of venue, and now I have to do it down here. I hope we haven't inconvenienced you too much. - Well-- - Not at all, Mr. MacShayne is delighted to cooperate in any way. In fact, he'll be handling the hotel's end of security during your stay. - Wonderful. - Low profile, right MacShayne? We're on top of things here. - Well, if I had a bed to sleep in, I'm sure I would sleep much better knowing that. (all chuckling) - If there's anything you need, you'll know where to find me. - You know how embarrassing this is? I turn my back for one minute, enter the body snatchers. - Well, if you would occasionally deign to pick up your messages, it wouldn't come as such a shock. - I have been very busy bagging a crooked dealer, thank you. - Don't sound so overworked, that's the reason you're here, remember? To work off your considerable debt to this hotel by providing security. Also, in that mountain of messages I left you, there's another little assignment. Our CEO's nephew, Bernard something-or-other, is spending the week with us. Mr. Kaufman would like you to take him under your wing. He actually thinks you'll do the boy good. - I will take Bernard something-or-other under my wing. I will teach him miniature golf. Just get me a room. - There's nothing I can do. - You're a vice president, pull a string, that's what vice presidents do. - With the Evans concert, I'm afraid there is no room at the inn. - So MacShayne ends up on a park bench. - Only if there's a cold snap and you promise to freeze to death.

Listen, if you treat me with respect, I'll do the same for you, and we'll just go through these two darn weeks, all right? - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, but if you can't keep up, baby, maybe I oughta do this one solo. - Oh. - 'Cause I've noticed that your style's gotten a little-- - Oh yeah, what? - A little soft since I left ya, and-- - Oh, since you left, since he left me!

When he shows up again, he says to me, "hold this," and he hands me a Bugs Bunny lunchbox. Yeah, well, a few seconds later, 500 airport cops are on me like white on rice. The kid had swiped it from the airport gift shop. - I've got this little problem. (light music) - [MacShayne] He is a kleptomaniac. - He is also the CEO's nephew. - He clipped a Bugs Bunny lunchbox! - It was a momentary lapse. I'm almost completely cured. - See, a momentary lapse. Won't happen again, will it, Bernard? - Word of honor. (tense music) - Daddy! - Hey there! - Daddy! - Hi, you guys! - I got my braces off, Pop! - Hey, you sure did. No more silver mine in there. - Now wait till you see the bill. It was a silver mine. - Oh, my. Hey, look what I got for you. One for you, big guy. And I didn't forget you. Here. Open 'em up. Oh, I missed you. - Me too. So how was Cleveland? - It was wet. - Wet? - You know, it's hard enough selling industrial supplies without having to do it in six inches of rain. - Heya, little brother, how was your trip? - Routine. - All right, everybody, come on, let's eat. - Yeah, we'll be right in. (door closes) - You know who that guy was? Japanese mafia, bigtime. - Not interested. - Oh, you don't wanna know who you popped? - He was unit, Patrick. Like a Maytag or a Pontiac. You move X number of units, you get X number of dollars. It's simple arithmetic. - Yeah? Well, this little math problem just generated a new job. We gotta move fast. - Patrick, I just got home, I wanna spend some time with Janet and the kids. - It pays a quarter of a million dollars, Albert. A quarter, hey, that can buy a lot of quality time. - All right, what's the target? (tense music) You gotta be crazy. You can't get close to him. - You don't have to. He's gonna come to us.

He's turning this into the Ozzy Evans show! - Don't you pull that star crap on me, baby. I made you! You were a roller skating carhop when I found you! - Ozzy, enough! Let's go, kids. - You screwed up our marriage with your booze and pills, and those sleazy hookers. - Well, your skirts were not exactly pristine, honey! - But ain't gonna screw up my career, Ozzy. - Or don't you count that little love-fest with your candy-ass lawyer friend? - You know, both of you had one thing in common. You were both miserable. In and out of bed. I told you if you ever laid a hand on me again that I'd blow your head off. (solemn music) - "Good news," she says. "I got you a room," she says. Sure. - You know, I've never seen anyone sleep with their shoes and socks on before. - Look, I don't have very much, Bernard, but what I have, I damn sure plan on keeping. Thank god it's quiet in here now. (woman screaming) (suspenseful music) - [Woman] It's Mr. Evans! (Harvey shouting) - Some security you provided, sweetheart. - I was supposed to provide security for overeager fans. It would've been nice if you'd told me someone wanted to kill him. - Cops are on the way. - What's going on? What's going on here? My god. Oh my god, Ozzy! Ozzy, Ozzy! - Take her to her room. Get everybody else out of here. - MacShayne! What happened, MacShayne?! No, let me go! I wanna stay with him! Ozzy! - So what's our next move, chief? - Our next move is you go to your room. - But I wanna help. - You wanna help? You go to your room, you lock yourself in your closet. - [Woman On PA] Amtrak number 23 from Chicago is now arriving at gate number three and will leave Las Vegas for Los Angeles in 30 minutes. Amtrak number 23... (mumbling drowned out by music) (pager beeping) (phone line ringing) - Yeah, Janet, hi, just got in, what's up? Well, you know how it is in Florida this time of year, it's wall to wall tourists. So what's wrong? Okay. All right, put him on. Okay, young man, you listen. You are not going to baseball camp unless you get the grades up, so you can just stop hawking your mother right this minute. Yeah, right now. All right. Okay, put her on. Yeah, sweetie, I think he got the message. Okay. I love you too. I'll call you soon, bye-bye. - I can't believe this. I just can't, I mean, Ozzy. He's gone. He was such a good man, really. - Saint. An absolute saint. - Well, I know this is difficult, Miss Evans, but I need a statement to write. - Yeah. Well. After Ozzy and I had our little tiff, you know, I mean, I went straight to my dressing room to lie down, to relax. And then when I was there, I heard all this noise outside in the hall, and so I went there to see. You know, to see... - If there's anything the hotel can do. - Lieutenant, I've been looking for you. Like to watch some television? - MacShayne. - [MacShayne] It's short, but it's very educational. - [Lieutenant] Better be important. - [MacShayne] Oh, it's important. - So what's that? - Surveillance camera outside Ozzy's dressing room. (solemn music) (video tape whirring) - What are you doing? - I'm getting to the good part. It gets better. (lieutenant sighs) - So she killed him. The munza deserved it. He was a pill-popping alchy. Temporary insanity. A little community service, a couple hospital appearances, boom, boom, boom, you're back on the road again. - Harvey, shut up! I didn't do it! I didn't. I didn't do it. He was dead when I got there. - [Lieutenant] Well then who killed him? You were the only company he had. And what were you doing with the doorknob, dusting it? - Five minutes before, I threatened to blow his head off, right? I just didn't want to get blamed for it. Can't you understand that? - Yeah, you had a history of violence in your marriage. Let me see, on one occasion, you tried to run him down with your car. - Yeah, I know it's sounds-- - Yeah, and on another occasion, you tried to bean him with a bottle of bourbon. - Scotch. And that was after he tried to stab me with a steak knife. Please. Please, you have to believe me. I didn't kill Ozzy. - Congratulations, MacShayne, half our headline attraction is dead and you've practically convicted the other half of murder. - She looked pretty guilty on tape, didn't she? - Well, I think she's innocent. - Why? Because you believe her story? Or because she headlines here 20 weeks a year? - You're a big help, MacShayne. (tense music) - MacShayne. - Thought I sent you to bed. - Well, I spoke to Dr. Friedman. - Who? - My therapist. Although he assured me that it was just a momentary lapse, that I'm almost completely cured, he said that I still need to make restitution, so. - Where'd you get all this stuff? - Ozzy's dressing room, right after his unfortunate demise. - Do you know why you do this? - Of course I know why. 12 years of analysis would be worthless unless I knew the root cause of my problem. Attention. My father's a trust fund, my mother's a world traveler, I mean, the only way I could ever get them to pay any attention to me was when I'd take things. Then they'd just drop everything and rush to my side. - You don't need an analyst, Bernard. You need a good spanking. This came from Ozzy's room? - Yeah, right next to the body. - This button could've come from a room service jacket. - So? - Room service? This is MacShayne. Do me a favor, will you check your records and see if any food was sent to Ozzy Evans's dressing room in the last 24 hours, please? No, I'll hold. - Wow, this place gives me the creeps. - You can always go back to your room. - I'd rather throw myself under a train. - Funny, that was my next suggestion. Really? Thanks. Ozzy did not order room service. - Well then what was that room service cart doing outside the door? Wait, we've got a room service button next to the body, a room service cart outside the door. This definitely has something to do with room service. - Oh, Bernard. Nothing gets past you, does it, my boy? I'll tell you this. Whoever brought that cart did not go out that door. - God, you are so good. Wait, how do you know? - It wasn't on the surveillance tape. - Must be on the tape coming in. - No. Tape's a two-hour loop. Means it erases itself every two hours. That cart was definitely there when our loop started. - Well he's not still here. What happened to him? - Found another way out. There trees where you come from, Bernard? - Yeah, lots, why? - Start climbing, pal. (solemn music) - Hey MacShayne. - [MacShayne] Hey, kid. What'd you find? - Nothin'. There's just a room with a door at the end, but that's locked from the other side. - So the only way down is the ladder? That ladder's 20 feet from the floor. What do you see from there? - The show. I can see a VIP row with a couple of security guards. - That's Franklin Carter's security. That's a perfect angle. - For what? - For Franklin Carter. - Carter? What does Carter have to do with it? - I don't know. But if the guy that killed Ozzy had to come down that ladder, he had a hell of a drop. - One simple task. - He was supposed to be on stage rehearsing, how the hell should I know he'd come back? - The whole reason we got you that room service job is so you'd have the run of the hotel without anybody becoming suspicious. Why didn't you wait till everyone was gone? - 'Cause our client is screaming for those photographs! And you know it's a two-part contract. - Did you find them? - No, they weren't in his dressing rom. - Are you sure? - I looked everywhere. I was just about to leave when this guy walks in. This crazy idiot went for a gun. - Give me. - What? - You didn't leave a gun with your fingerprints all over it in the room, did ya? All right, report to work as usual, I don't want anybody coming looking for you. - What are you gonna do? - What I have been doing since we were children. Clean up your mess. - Okay, chief, here's my idea. We roust everybody at food and beverage. We sweat 'em like pigs on a spit, okay? Till one of them talks. - Security, would you take this kid to his room and chain him to something really permanent for me, please. - MacShayne, wait. I thought we were a team! Come on, Holmes and Watson! Butch and Sundance, Nick and Nora! - Going somewhere? - How'd you get in here? - Security, remember? Well, that's a pretty dumb move. - The only dumb thing about it is not doing it sooner. - If you leave here, you might as well sign a confession. - You'd love that, wouldn't you? You don't even give me the benefit of the doubt. Might as well put a noose around my neck and yell "pull," right? - No no no no. They shoot people in this state. - Oh, very fu, what are you doing?! Damn you! Let go of me! Let go! Put me down, MacBayne! What are you doing?! What are you doing?! (Cindy shouting) Oh my god. - I came to tell you I believe you. (light music) - What? - I don't think you killed Ozzy. - You don't? - Not unless you just wanna confess. - Oh! Oh my god, thank you! Thank you! Excuse me. I didn't mean to. Oh, MacShayne. I'm sorry I've been such a pain, it's just, I've been so frightened because even the truth makes me look guilty, you know? And I just needed someone who believed in me. - I believe you. But we're not out of the woods yet. Hey, I'm sorry about the shower. - Ah, don't worry about it. You know, it felt kind of good. So, what made you change your mind? - I think Ozzy was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Whoever shot him was really planning on shooting Franklin Carter. - Ah, I know him. Bastard. - You know Franklin Carter? - Yeah. From a long time ago. Our paths crossed. So, tell me something, what did Ozzy have to do with all this? - This has nothing to do with Ozzy. There's an air shaft in his dressing room that leads up to a cat walk above the stage, and from that cat walk, you get a good clean shot at the seat where Franklin Carter was gonna sit during your concert. I think Ozzy just stumbled into the guy while he was checking it out. - Wow. Poor Ozzy, huh? He didn't deserve this at all, but he sure was a rat. - You calm enough to stay put? - Yeah. With you in my corner, I think I can even buy a house here. MacShayne. You sure know how to make a girl feel better. - Well you certainly know how to irritate people. You were due here an hour ago. - I am sorry, sir, I had a problem. - Yeah, so we heard. Kinda makes me feel all warm and cozy we're in charge of Mr. Carter's security and not you. - Gentlemen, shall we get on with it? I'm due in judge's chambers in 20 minutes. - All right, let's talk about security for the Cindy Evans concert, huh? So he can enjoy it. - If you really want him to enjoy it, keep him home, let him buy her CD. - Well, nothing beats a live performance. - Providing, of course, you live through it. - Now what is that supposed to mean? (device beeping) - Is something wrong with your copier? - No, we haven't even used it yet. Look, what does this mean-- - Get out, get out. Just get the hell out. Get out, you too, go. - Hey, what are you doing?! - Get out! - For crying out loud. - Are you crazy? - Get out, get out! (tense music) (device beeping) Oh my god. - I want that man replaced. (device beeping) (fire alarm ringing) (explosion booming) - Gonna have to sift him through a strainer. - Who? - MacShayne. - He was in here when this went off? - Cost him his life, but he saved ours. - Oh, god! - Were you close? - No, no, not really, not as close as I would've liked. But he was a wonderful man. He was warm and kind and I didn't realize how fond of him I was until-- - Thanks. That is so sweet. - MacShayne! - It's a shame a man has to die to hear kind words like that. - [Franklin] How did you survive that? - I threw that sucker down that stairwell and I ran like hell upstairs. - This is going on your bill, MacShayne. Every single last crispy piece of metal I can find, I'm gonna wrap around your neck and have you rebuild this corridor inch by inch! - Thank you. - Any idea who'd wanna do this? (phone ringing) - We got a laundry list. - Starting with the gentleman I'm prosecuting for labor racketeering. Hello. - [Man On Phone] Mr. Carter? - This is Franklin Carter. - [Man On Phone] You've got a guardian angel, Carter. The should be scraping you off the walls with-- - Now you can tell your friends, it'll take a lot more than a firecracker to stop me. - Well, if we can get to you in your hotel room, just imagine all the places we can leave presents for you. Think about that on your way to court. (dial tone ringing) - Did we get it? - [Leonard] We'll know soon enough. - [Franklin] Because I receive so many threats, the phone company has a tap on the line. Every incoming call is automatically traced. - Desert Springs Motel, Airport Drive. - [Franklin] Go. - Where are you going? - With you. - Oh, look, you got lucky with the copier, pal, don't push it. - Leonard, without Mr. MacShayne's luck, you would be an interesting design on the sofa right now. But what distresses me even more is that I would be right beside you. - Let's go, Leonard. (gun clicks) - Ah, long gone. What's that? - It's a key to a locker. - That was careless, huh? - Maybe. - Meaning what? - Look around you, there's not a hair out of place, yet he leaves this so a blind man could find it. - Wait a minute, MacShayne. Hold on, hold on. - [Woman On PA] Eastbound train stopping at Dallas, New Orleans, Miami, (mumbling drowned out by music) - [Franklin] That's quite a haul. - Okay. Customized 378 Weatherby Magnum hunting rifle. Pinpoint accuracy at 300 yards. Stingray Mark 5 laser sighting device. Look at this. 110 grain hollow point shells. You could bring down an elephant at half a mile with this gear. - And that's not the scariest thing in there. This is your schedule for the next eight weeks, including your seat assignment at the Cindy Evans concert. - Franklin. Oh, I rushed over the minute I heard. Thank god you're all right. - It's all right, nevermind that. Thank this man, John MacShayne. My wife, Joan. - Thank you so much. I don't know what I'd do without Franklin. - Why don't you run up and change, we'll grab a bite? - Okay. Billy, could you bring the bags, please? - Any suggestions on how we deal with this gentleman? - Same thing I recommended before. You buy her CD and crank up the volume. - That's exactly what these thugs want. For me to crawl under a rock and hide, but I'm the rule of law in this state and I am not running. - Fine. Then Mr. Carter, we need to talk. Privately. (solemn music) - She's in the bathroom, sir, changing. - What's on your mind? - Who all knows your schedule this far in advance? - Just my staff. - What about your wife? - My wife likes to know where I am at any given moment. What's your point, you think it's an inside job? - Unless this guy's psychic, yes I do. - Well, I vouch for my staff. They've all been with me for years. - You can vouch for 'em if you want to. But he's getting your schedule from someone. - Are you saying you're the only one I can trust? - Oh, having a sidebar? - [Franklin] Dear, I thought we were going out to dinner? - I'm sure Mr. MacShayne's seen more skin than this down at the pool. All those young lovelies in their thong bikinis. Been down to the pool yet, darling? - [MacShayne] I'll see you first thing in the morning. - Was that necessary? - I'm sorry, I can't play the dutiful wife 24 hours a day. At least not without more of this. - We had a bargain. And you're not holding up your end. - I didn't realize this constituted a public appearance. - You... Why did I ever marry? - You know why, dearest. I make the best blueberry pie this side of the Rockies. Had your fill yet? - More than you know. (solemn music) (tense music) - Little late to be out prowling around, isn't it? - We have a new employee, his locker's C-180. Can you tell me his name, please? - Go through channels. - I can't do that. And if this guy's who I think he is, he may very well have an effect on Franklin Carter's personal safety. - I need authorization. - Authorization, I can't, Margaret, I can't. Oh, how would you like to sit front row center at Cindy Evans's concert? You might save the life of the next senator. And be my personal date. Don't say thank you, just please give me his name. (sighs) (computer beeps) - Name's Pete Brenner. Just put him on, part time. - Pete Brenner. Is he working today? (keyboard clacking) (computer beeps) - Uh-uh. Not due till tomorrow morning. - Will you call me if he comes in? Get yourself a new dress. Hey, charge it to Miss Foss, tell her I have Mr. Kaufman's personal authorization. She'll love it. (laughs) - Leave me alone! Pig. I can't believe it. You know, this creep just offered me $50,000 to pose next to Ozzy's casket. - Operator, this is MacShayne. Should put a block on all the calls to Cindy Evans's room until I notify you. Thank you. - Oh, I'd go nuts without you, MacShayne. Why in the hell am I calling you MacShayne, huh? If this mess doesn't put us on a first name basis, what would? (knocking on door) - [MacShayne] Who is it? - [Man At Door] Flowers for Miss Evans. (camera clicks) - In the wrong room, pal. - I'll get you a security guard out there. - Well, I don't think I need one. (laughs) Thank you. You know, now that we're on a first name basis, how about you and I run off to a desert island where nobody has ever heard of Cindy Evans, hmm? - Sounds wonderful. - When do we go? - The problem is, after the first week, you'd be singing to the trees, and you know it. - Yeah, I guess you're right. (laughs) You know, when Ozzy and I got divorced, I was a completely basket case. I worked my you know what off to rebuild my career. And look where it got me. Hiding in a hotel room. Although I shouldn't complain, I'm with a very attractive man. (knocking on door) - Easy, easy, pal. In some states, that's called assaulting an officer. - Come on in. We've had some unwanted visitors lately. - Well, now you got another one. Do you own a gun, Miss Evans? - No. - Are you sure? - I should know if I own a gun or not. - Well, we found the one that killed your ex-husband, it was in a laundry chute next to your dressing room, wrapped in one of your monogrammed towels. Smith and Wesson snub-nosed .38. Registered in your name. - Oh, that gun. Well, I forgot completely about it. - Cindy. - No no no, Ozzy gave it to me when we got married, and I put it in a drawer and I never touched it. I don't know what happened to it after we got divorced. Maybe he took it with him. - Well, I hate to do this, Miss Evans, my wife and I are big fans. You have the right to remain silent. - What? - Yes, we catch your act every time it comes to town. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. - MacShayne, talk to the man. - It's too late for me to talk to him, Cindy. - You have the right to an attorney. If it's not too much problem, I'd like an autographed picture, just make it out to Bernice. Do you understand each of these rights that I've given to you? - Oh, I can't believe it. - You know, Phil, for whatever it's worth, I don't think she did this. - Look, the guy probably deserved it. But if everybody got knocked off who needed to be wasted, you and I would be the only two left on this planet. And I'm not so sure about you. (dramatic music) - Cindy! Cindy! - Right there, MacShayne. (gun clicks) - She's getting away. - Yeah, and you helped her. - What? - You got the right to remain silent. - Me?! - Anything you say can and will be used against you-- - Oh, Phil, come on, Phil. (light music) (footsteps approaching) - Ah. I dreamed of seeing you this way, MacShayne, and now it's my sad duty to set you free. Life can be so unfair. Our esteemed CEO, Mr. Kaufman, wants you to clear Cindy Evans of these charges. - I can do that. - However, I also got him to agree to withdraw your bail and have you locked up until your trial if you should fail. - Well it's so nice to have you on my side, Miss Foss. - Three stitches. Think I can get Cindy Evans to autograph the scar? - Gotta find her first. - Oh, we'll find her. Anybody as famous as that young lady can't get three steps without somebody recognizing her. And after we find her, I'm coming after you, MacShayne. Aiding and abetting a fugitive to escape, assaulting a police officer, or anything else I can come up with. - I like that man. (light music) Well, any ideas, or am I gonna be sending you poisoned cookies in the pen? - Cindy Evans is a star. What is the one thing a star is? - Infuriating. - Hopeless. I doubt seriously if she can mail a letter or write a check, much less plan an escape. She's used to being serviced and catered to. So who do you think licks her stamps and pays her bills? - And Miss Evans had absolutely nothing to do with her husband's untimely death. Although divorced, they remained good friends, completely devoted to one another, which is why they took on this reunion concert. (light music) - Hey, Harvey! Hey, I'm really sorry, man. - Hey, a little early to hit the sauce, isn't it MacShayne? - If I didn't tell 'em, they were gonna throw away the key. - Tell 'em what? What are you babbling about? - I got a little lead on where Cindy's hiding. - What?! - Had to tell the cops, man, they were being really mean to me! - Idiot, you're an idiot! - Hey Harvey. - Idiot! - You tell her I said I'm really sorry. - [Harvey] Idiot! - [MacShayne] I'm gonna write her every day. (light music) - Hey pal, next guy that gets in here, I want you to give him the ride of his life. Make sure he ends up at Boulder Dam. - Give me another one of these and I'll throw him in. - West Tropicana and Decater. Move it! - I am, all right! - Move it, let's go. (cassette tape whirring) Get the hell out of there. Yeah, the cops know where you are. Where do we meet? (tense music) - Harvey? Jack! - You look lovely, my dear. Bitchin' outfit! Pretty inconspicuous, I might add. - Harvey said that if I disguised and I came over here, no one would find me. - You know Cindy, to call you stupid would be a major compliment to you. (Cindy scoffs) - Well, I panicked, all right? No one believes me. - Why would no one believe you? First you try to run over the man with your car, then you hit him in the head with a bottle of whiskey-- - Scotch. - Scotch, then you threaten to kill him in front of people the day he dies, and the security camera catches you running away from the murder scene. - Yeah, and the gun that shot him was mine. - Let's not forget, the gun that shot him is yours. And when you left, you got burdened on my case. You give me one reason why I shouldn't turn you over to him. - Jack, I'm innocent! You know, my whole life has been one screw-up after another. And just when I thought that I was turning it around, Ozzy comes running back into it. - [MacShayne] Let's get outta here. - Where are we going? - Someplace I promise you they won't think to look for you. - What the hell are we gonna do, Al? This is a two-part contract, it's the target and the photographs. - Figure out where they're not, maybe that'll point us in their direction. - Well, they're not in his dressing room, they're not in his hotel room, and when he was a druggie, he alienated all his friends, so he's got no one to lay them off on. - So what does that leave? - Nothing! (gun clicks) (gunshot bangs) - This thing's still pulling to the right. Maybe they're with his ex. - He hated her, and the feeling was mutual. - Well, maybe she doesn't know she has 'em. - Hey, why would he stash 'em with her? - Patrick, did you think to look in there? (suspenseful music) (gunshots banging) Now, on your horse, Patrick, I wanna get home in time to see my son's ball game, he's pitching. (birds chirping) - Are you okay? - I hate this. You know, you managed to hit every pothole and speed bump in the city! - Yeah, this thing could use new shocks, couldn't it? - Yeah, sure can. - Wait right here, I'll be back. - Wait wait, where are you going? - I've got an idea, I'm gonna try something. - Oh. - Don't go anywhere. - Okay, hurry up, all right? Okay, bye. (light music) (Bernard sighing) - How you doing? - Well, it's a little rough on the kidneys, MacShayne. - [Cindy] Ouch. - Bernard, we have a guest. Say hello to Cindy Evans. - I am such a big fan of yours. - Whoa, MacShayne. What is this, huh? Some kind of kinky sex thing or what? - Bernard, you gotta tell her-- - Bitchin' outfit. Can you please? - Got a hairpin? - Oh, yeah. - A hairpin? You can open one of these things with a hairpin? - Of course, Bernard, anybody can do this. - Look, your ex-wife called, she said knowing you, she believed I was viciously handcuffed. - She would. - Handcuffs, huh? (dial tone ringing) (phone beeping) (phone line ringing) - [Ellen] Hi, this is Ellen. I can't get the phone now, but if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you. (phone beeps) - Hi Ellen, this is Jack. If you're there, will you pick up, please? You're obviously not there. Look, I'm sorry I missed your call. I've been hobnobbing with the stars. But tell Matt I know his birthday's coming up, and I love him and I haven't forgotten him. Okay, thanks. - Still carrying a torch? - It's more like a flickering candle now. - Yeah. I know the feeling. - Did my ex-wife say anything else? - Yeah, she said quit bugging her. (phone ringing) - Those her exact words? - Mm-hmm. - Hi, MacShayne. You did? How's he walking? With a limp. No no no, let him go to work. I just want to know where he is at all times. Thanks. Bernard, I never thought I'd say this, but I want you to keep an eye on Cindy, don't let her leave this room. - Does this mean I'm back on the case? - Well, it means you're not gonna be chained to the closet. - Well, it's a start. - And you, it's almost over. Can you handle this? - Mm-hmm. I can handle anything. (light music) - [Franklin] I see. And this limping man, as you call him. - [MacShayne] Patrick Blondel, if that's his name. - And you think he's responsible for Ozzy Evans's death and the attempt on me. - He works in room service. There was a hotel button found near Ozzy's body and one missing from his jacket. And the only way out of Ozzy's dressing room is through an air duct, ends up on the stage, with a 20-foot drop. - And you figure that's how he got his limp? That's circumstantial. - It's all we've got. (Franklin exhales) - Well. I'm announcing for the Senate this afternoon. I'm doing it from the courthouse steps. It's a little dramatic, perhaps, but-- - You don't wanna do that. - I like going to the theater, MacShayne. I like going to the big show. I like a nice meal in a good restaurant. I like to take long walks with my wife. - You do that, and your wife and I will be taking a long walk to your grave site. - And as I told you once before, I am not going to be intimidated. - It's your neck. - Maybe you are the only one I can trust, MacShayne. (solemn music) Stop him, before he stops me. - That's a tall order. - And I'm betting my life that you can fill it. - And despite warnings from police and his own staff, Special Prosecutor Franklin Carter has chosen the front steps of the-- - Can you give me a hand with this, please? - For a major announcement at one o'clock this afternoon. Now we expect to have more concerning this announcement tonight at 11. - You're vain, arrogant, ambitious, self-serving, and personally dishonest. But I never thought you were suicidal. - Only when I'm around you. - You could get your head blown off out there, you know that, don't you? - Well, anything to make you happy, dear. - Well, I do have this new black dress that I've been dying to wear. Oh, don't worry, dearest, if anything happens to you, I promise I'll be a credit to your memory. - The way you were in Reno? So drunk you almost fell off the stage. - My heel caught. - On a bottle of vodka. Joan, when are you gonna get a handle on it? You've been to Betty Ford more times than Betty Ford. - Do you think that if they get you after you're elected to the Senate, they'll appoint me to your seat? (glass shattering) (Joan laughing) Just a thought. (tense music) (birds chirping) (phone beeping) - Blondel just went into a bowling alley around the corner from the courthouse. Right. (phone beeps) (tense music) - As Lieutenant Governor of the great state of Nevada, it is now my pleasure to introduce Franklin Carter, special prosecutor. (crowd applauding) - Thank you, Lieutenant Governor Wagnor. Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna thank you all for coming out here today. (bowling pins crashing) (tense music) (phone beeping) - Look, I can't figure this out. All I know is he's not going anywhere. Yeah, I'm on my way back. - As you know, this decision was not arrived at quickly or capriciously, but the job of a United States senator, especially in these trying times, is filled with unexpected danger. (gunshot bangs) (sirens wailing) (people shouting) - Are you okay? - You don't have to say it, MacShayne, I was an idiot to think I could pull this off. - Look, guys, you need to know something about this doesn't ring true to me. I mean, it's like he knew I was following him. He led me around like I had a ring in my nose. - He's always one step ahead of us, isn't he, but how do we catch up? - I think you need to disappear. - I have a trial coming up. - Then get it postponed. - That will look like I'm running scared. - Then maybe you need to run scared, 'cause dead men don't make the senate. - We have a houseboat, it's up on Lake Mead. We occasionally stash witnesses there. - Who knows about this? - It hasn't been used in the last six months. - Let me check it out. - MacShayne. I learned something today. I'm not as brave as I thought I was. - None of us are. (solemn music) - MacShayne. - Birdie. How's the big man's head? - You know, it occurred to me. Where is the last place anyone would look for Cindy Evans? (MacShayne mumbles) Mind if I peek in your room? - No, long as you got a search warrant. - Bernard. (knocking on door) Hey Bernard, it's MacShayne. I'm coming in with Lieutenant Birdie. - Heavy sleeper. - He had a long night. Are you satisfied? - For now. - I am outraged that you would think I might harbor a fugitive in my room. - Well, it was worth a shot. - Bernard. Bernard. (water splashing) Bernard, get up. Where is Cindy? - Cindy? Cindy, we were playing cards. - In your underwear? - Yeah, well, you know, to make things more interesting, 'cause we didn't have anything to bet with, so she suggested strip poker. - She suggested what? - Well, the thought of seeing Miss Evans in her unmentionables was more than I could resist. But I'm afraid that she's a better player than I am, because as I was bending over to take off my pants, everything went fuzzy. I think she knocked me out with that vase. - Seems to be the weapon of choice. Why would she hit you? - Well, she said that she felt icky in those biker clothes, wanted to change, take a shower. But you know, I said absolutely not, it was my sworn duty to... (door closes) (tense music) (water running) - Hey! (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) Cindy? Cindy. - MacShayne? Oh, god! What did he want? - Afraid he wanted you. - Why would someone wanna kill me? - We're gonna figure that out somewhere else. (solemn music) It's all clear, you can come out now. - [Cindy] All right. - Hey, that wasn't very sporting of you, Miss Evans. - Oh, I'm sorry, Bernard. Listen, if it's any consolation, that shower nearly cost me my life, and I didn't even get to take it. - None of this makes sense to me. I mean, why would someone who wants to kill Carter wanna kill you? - I don't know. But you know, maybe one thing has nothing to do with the other. - No, they are tied together somehow. If they could find you before, they will find you again. From now on, you and I are joined at the hip. - Well, you're going way out on a limb. - I care what happens to you. - Well, be careful, MacShayne. You might restore my faith in men. - Alice. Call the airport for me, if you will, and ask 'em to fire up the corporate jet. Of course, I have personal permission from Mr. Kaufman. - Do you? - Never even met the man. (tense music) - What's in these tanks? - Gasoline, use this platform to fuel the houseboats. Yeah, perfect. - Now how'd you get this barge? - Oh, some guys dying to get out of the business. Okay. Let's do it. I hate this. - Kid doesn't know how to swim, he should stay out of the water. Look, Al, I'm helping you with your half, you're not helping me with mine. - Listen, I said I'd handle it. - Al, you could kill a whole regiment, we still won't get that money, not until we find those photographs. - Those pictures are here somewhere. You just stay out of sight. - Hey, I'm not some kid you can send to his room. We're equal partners in this thing. - MacShayne's made you. - So what! - So he finds you, he finds me. He finds me, he finds my family. If that happens, I'll kill you. (tense music) Brother or no. (light music) - I hate to say it, but I looked much better as a psycho slut. Where'd you get this wig at? - Don't make fun of it, Jerry Lewis used to wear that in his act. - Really? Well, it feels like he's still in it. (chuckles) What's with the badge? - It's a little something Bernard copped at the sheriff's department. Sometimes his little problem comes in handy. Stand back here, just follow my lead. - Oh, I'm gonna be recognized. - You won't be recognized. - Yes. - Mrs. Patrick Blondel? - No, there is no Mrs. Patrick Blondel. Patrick's my husband's brother. He lives with us. - Sergeant MacShayne. This is my partner Sergeant Lewis. Any chance we might speak to him? - He's in Florida on business. - Do you know how to reach him? - What's this about? - He's wanted in connection with an assault and robbery. - Patrick? No, Patrick doesn't go around assaulting people, he's a respectable businessman. - I'm sorry, as a witness. He's one of the few people that can actually identify our perps. - Oh, please, come in. I have a beeper number, but it's only for emergencies. - Well, this was a pretty brutal assault, ma'am. - Oh, yes, of course. - What does your brother-in-law do for a living? - He and my husband sell industrial supplies, all over the country. He'll call back in just a second. - It's okay to ask. - Ask what? - She does look familiar, doesn't she? - Well, yeah, as a matter of fact, she does. - She looks like-- - Cindy Evans? - Yes, yes, you're a dead ringer for her. Except for the hair. - Oh, it happens all the time. (phone ringing) - Patrick? - Hon, what's up, what's wrong? - No no, no, nothing's wrong. It's a Sergeant MacShayne, he's here to talk to you about the assault that you witnessed. - MacShayne? - Yeah, hold on. - Mr. Blondel. (tense music) - What are you doing there? - I'm looking for you, sir. (Patrick sighs) - God! Hey, look, you leave her out of this? - It actually is you I would like to speak with. - Rudolpho's, 8:00, it's the restaurant at the corner of Third and Grand, be there. - Fine. So it is true. The early bird does get the worm. (suspenseful music) (both grunting) (Patrick yelling) (solemn music) (siren wailing) - Wait. If it's the guy that killed Ozzy, then I don't have to run anymore. - Cindy, we can't prove that. - Yeah, I see your point. - Let's go. - Let's go. (solemn music) - [Man] Hey, what are you doing? - Gee, you scared me. I got a call, phone was on the blink. - You with the phone company? - Well yeah, I don't do this as a hobby. - Where's your uniform? - It's my day off. You know, the regular guy was in a fender bender. He called me as I was about to go fishing. - You got a work order? - Sure I do. Sure, got it right here. (suspenseful music) Dammit, man. You are making me behind schedule. (tense music) - You know I think you're beginning to enjoy throwing dirty laundry on top of me. - Well, if you wanna be recognized, and spend 30 years of your life in prison, that's fine with me. - How far away? - About an hour. - An hour?! I'm not gonna drive here for an hour, are you nuts? - Well then get in the floor behind the seats, you can ride there till we get outta town. - Oh, you're so kind. - It's always been one of my flaws. (tense music) (device beeping) - You know, Ozzy and I once played on a river boat on the Mississippi? If you were no good, overboard. - Find yourself a bunk. We're gonna check this place out. - Okay. (light music) (Cindy gasps) - Shh, quiet, not a sound. Not a sound, you got it? Here we go. Nice and easy. Here we go. All right, hands up, everybody, hands on top of your head. Don't test it. That's good, you too. Hey, turn around. All right, any of you familiar with the sound of a hammer being cocked? - [MacShayne] I've heard it a time or two. (gun clicks) That's it, all right. - Now, turn around, very slowly, as slowly as you possibly can. That's good. Now who the hell are you and what are you doing here? - John MacShayne. - Cindy. Cindy Lewis. - [Al] It's all right, hands down. Put 'em down. - It's your turn, pal, who are you? - York, deputy sheriff, I'm in charge of security here. - They don't give you guys uniforms anymore? - Yeah, I was on my way home, I saw some kids playing on the dock. Thought I'd better make sure everything was okay in here. How'd you people get in here? - With the key. Franklin Carter gave it to me. - Yeah, we'll see. Stay where you are. (phone beeping) Yeah, Franklin Carter, please. Do you have any idea how I can reach him? No. No, it's okay, it can wait. His office doesn't know where he is. Damn, I wish they'd tell me about these things. - Yeah, it was a spur of the moment thing. - Yeah, I guess it's okay. Look, I'm sorry I made you jump. - It's okay, it was good exercise. - Well, I'm sure I'll see you again. - You guys wanna check around outside? (glass shatters) (Cindy shouting) Cindy? Are you okay? - You! - Me?! - You son of... - I am so tired of you throwing things at me! - Why didn't you tell me this was his place?! - Whose place? - Carter's! - This isn't Carter's place, this is a safe house, where you bring witnesses. - Oh, really? What about his pictures all over, huh? - He's a guy who likes to look at himself. - I'm not staying here. - Cindy, Cindy. Now it's pretty obvious that this guy's done something to really hurt you. Or you had an affair with him. And guess which way I'm leaning. - It wasn't an affair. - Then what was it? - Well, at least not on my side. I loved him. - You loved him? - Yeah. And I thought he loved me too. I was ready to marry him. And I found out that would be highly impractical, since he already had a wife. - The present Mrs. Carter? - Yeah, and then I found out that I wasn't the only one. He had them hidden all across the state. - Cindy, tell me the truth. Are you still in love with this guy? - I'm too angry to be in love. Too humiliated. You know, for whatever it's worth, you're the first man that has been completely straight with me. - Okay. Tell me about this relationship with Carter. How long ago was it? - It was right before our divorce. - Before the divorce? Did Ozzy know? - Oh, he sure did. He was jealous as hell. He even hired a private investigator. - A private investigator, like wiretaps and long camera lenses and video tapes? - Yeah. Only the best for Ozzy. - Well, if this guy was any good, he had to find something and give it to Ozzy, something these people haven't found yet. Think about this, Cindy, this is important. Did Ozzy have a place he stashed things? A place no one knew about, maybe not even you? Ozzy did drugs, where would he keep his drugs? - His guitar case. (snaps fingers) (phone beeping) - 312, please. Bernard. Look, you're back on the case, pal. I need you to go backstage in the showroom, somewhere back there, find Ozzy's guitar case and sit on it. (tense music) (groaning) - I can't hear a word you're saying. You saying it's cramped in there? All right, won't be long. (pager beeping) (Al sighs) (phone beeping) Yeah, Janet, what is it? How'd it happen? No. We have been in Florida. Patrick went out to Las Vegas because we got a new account out there. Janet, you're gonna have to slow down, I can't follow you. What policeman? He called Patrick from our house? MacShayne. Sergeant MacShayne. Yeah, I'll take care of it, honey, I'll see you tonight. (phone beeping) It's me, listen. I'll take MacShayne out too. No extra charge. (dramatic music) (phone beeps) (suspenseful music) - What is she doing here? - She needs the same type of protection you do. - She's a fugitive from a murder charge. - And she's placing herself in your custody. - And I thought you were going to be in Vegas sorting things out. - I'm on my way. There's one piece of this puzzle I haven't solved. - Well, you better find it soon. - [MacShayne] I'll be back. Don't let anyone in or out. - [Man] Yes sir. - Thank you for your hospitality, Mr. Carter. - My wife, Joan. Cindy Evans. - Hello. - If you did bump off your husband, more power to you. - Oh, I didn't do it. - Well, that's a pity. I always like to root for the good guys. - Why don't we unpack? - I don't know about you, but I'm parched from the trip. Join me in a mineral water? - [Cindy] No, thank you. - So, what do you think of my husband? - What do you mean? - I mean, do you think he's Senate material? - I'm not into politics. - Someone tried to kill him yesterday. That should be good for at least 100,000 votes. Would it get yours? - I'm not from this state. - But if you were, would you pull your lever for dear old Franklin? - I doubt it. - Me either. (tense music) - What are we lookin' for, chief? - Buried treasure, Bernard. - Wow! I did not know that Miss Evans had a mole on her-- - A gentleman never discusses a lady's mole. - My lips are sealed. - This is what they're looking for. - Hey, do you think that Ozzy was trying to blackmail Carter with this stuff? - Any one of these would've wrecked his career before he ever got out of the gate. - "My dearest Cindy, I can't stop thinking "about last night, your touch, your feel, the way--" - Didn't your mother tell you not to ever read anyone else's mail? (tense music) Bernard, call the sheriff's department. Tell them to send some men to the houseboat at Lake Mead. Matter of fact, tell them to send a battalion. - Joan, would you like me to unpa-- - Sweetheart. - Where did you get that? - The tooth fairy. - If I find out who supplying you with booze, I'll cut 'em off at their knees. (Joan laughs) - Darling, you'd have to cripple half your staff. So tell me, dear. How was my husband in bed? - Joan. - I mean, on a scale of one to 10, did he make the scale? - You knew about us? - I knew about all of them. I mean, there's just so many pies that you can bake. - Well, he never told me he was married. - Of course not. Why spoil the fun with a downer like that? But now that you're a shoe-in for Senate, you can't sweep me under the rug anymore. No sirree, I'll be standing right there beside you on the capital steps. - Or falling down them. - Either way, darling, you're stuck with me. (tense music) - Getting stuffy in there, pal? Let me give you a little air. - [Dispatcher] 26, dispatcher 26, come in, Dave. - 26 here. - [Dispatcher] Yeah, Dave, I just got a call about some trouble at that houseboat on the lake. Check it out, will ya? - 10-four. All right, don't go away, pal, I'll be right back. - I never meant to hurt you or her. - You didn't give a damn about neither one of us, long as someone put a smile on your face. - It's in the past. It should stay there. (Cindy chuckles) - Oh, Frankie, baby. What's the matter? Afraid I'll go public and sink your senatorial ship? - The thought has crossed my mind. - Well, I wouldn't do that to her. She's suffered long enough just by being your wife. (tense music) (watch beeping) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) (device sparking and beeping) (phone ringing) - No one's supposed to know we're here. Cindy, get out. Joan! Come on, go, go! (suspenseful music) (Cindy coughing) Joan! Come on, get up. Get up! Come on. - Get down! (gunshot bangs) Get on the other side of the boat and stay there. (Joan coughing) - MacShayne! MacShayne, what are you doing? You'll kill me! - That's the general idea, isn't it, Mr. Carter? - MacShayne! - Take a shot! You're not gonna get a cleaner shot than this! - Are you crazy?! Let go of me! (suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) (gunshot bangs) (explosion booming) - You may wanna check on that guy and just see if there's anything left of him. - You would've got me killed, MacShayne. (Franklin grunts) - I actually tried, Mr. Carter. See, I wanted to test my little theory. It's my theory that they never planned on shooting you at all. That you wanted to have her shot. - Me? - Yeah, you see, he was embarrassed by your drinking, Mrs. Carter, he didn't want to be seen with you in Washington. But if he divorced you, he'd never get to Washington. - So you were gonna have me killed? - You've got a hell of an imagination, MacShayne. - And all those attempts on your life were just a chance to buy time so that the assassin would be caught. Someone throws a little tear gas on here, everyone runs out, they miss you, they hit her, that's pretty clean. - The grieving widower. That would've been good for a couple hundred thousand votes. - It's a fairy tale, and you can't prove a thing! - Really? Well, let's start with this. I think handwriting analysis will tell you that whoever wrote this love letter to Cindy Evans also wrote the phone number to this boat on this paper. Gosh, I hope this doesn't crimp your chances for the Senate, Mr. Carter. (solemn music) - I like it. - Is it me, or the room? - One compliments the other. - [Bernard] MacShayne. - Bernard, Bernard. As usual, great timing. - Yeah, well, look, these last couple days with you have completely changed my life. Guess where I'm going. - Far away, I hope? - Detective school. From now on, I'm gonna pattern my life like yours, chief. A man living on the edge, spitting at destiny. - Well, make sure the wind doesn't shift, Bernard. - When I come back, I'm gonna have a badge in my pocket and a gun on my hip. - Oh god. - That's dangerous. - You know, maybe we could partner on a case again, huh? - Bernard. Give Cindy her watch back. (Cindy gasps) - Sorry. - How did you do this? - I was just making sure I haven't lost my touch. - He's very good. - Oh, he's good. He's excellent. - Where were we? (gentle music) - Two weeks isn't enough. - You'll be back. - Yeah, but why can't you come on the road with me? - It's not my deal, Cindy. - We can have lots of fun. ♪ In my dreams ♪ - That's not fair. ♪ It would never end this way ♪ Me either, babe. But today is my son's birthday, and I just thought I'd do something unselfish for a change. - I understand. So, why don't you call him? - I would never get through his mother's answering machine. - Really? Huh. Well, let's try, dial his number. - She's not gonna let me talk to him. - Hmm, mm-hmm, wanna bet? (phone beeping) What is his name? - Matt. (phone line ringing) - [Ellen] Hi, this is Ellen. I can't-- - I got the machine. - [Cindy] Okay. - [Ellen] But if you leave your name and number, I'll get right back to you. (phone beeps) - Hi, yes, this message is for Matt MacShayne, and he just won a wonderful set of encyclopedia, with gold-- - [Ellen] Hello? - Oh, yes, hi, who's this? - [Ellen] This is Matt's mother, I'm sorry about the answering machine, but some pest keeps calling me. - Oh, don't worry about it. Is he there? - [Ellen] Yeah, just a minute. - Okay. She called you a pest. What does that mean? (laughs) - [Matt] Hello? What did I win? - The grand prize. - Is it Matt? Matt? This is your dad. Happy birthday, son. - [Matt] Dad? (gentle music) (upbeat music)
