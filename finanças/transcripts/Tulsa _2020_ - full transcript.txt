You little monsters, can you not hear me? Are you deaf? You're not listening to me! Can't you hear me? Listen to me, now stop! Police, open up! Why are you here? You're under arrest for assault and battery of minors. - Ma'am. - I didn't do anything. Get away from me. Tell them the truth. I didn't do anything to you kids. You hear me? I was your last chance, nobody wants you! Your family didn't even want you! You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. I have some rights you know! Don't worry, I'll make sure you're taken care of, I promise. Have a good night Kerry. Oh, Jaylene I got another case for you. What's her story? Mom was killed in a motorcycle accident two years ago. The little girl called the cops when the foster mom went after the foster brother. And where is he now? They found temporary placement for him. Her name is Tulsa. You need to find a replacement before you leave tonight. Kerry, you know that's impossible. I mean, all of our beds are full. Try Michelle at the Atlanta Mission. Sometimes she's willing to foster kids for short term emergencies. The sooner you find her placement, the sooner you can start your weekend. Have a good night Kerry. See you Monday. Tulsa hi, I'm Ms. Jaylene. I'm gonna be your caseworker. How's Michael? He is staying with relatives in South Georgia for now anyway. They should know he's scared of the dark and sometimes he wets his bed but if you read to him, it'll calm him down. You two got pretty close didn't you? I know Jesus will take care of him. Do you believe in Jesus Ms. Jaylene? Yes I do. You know, you are pretty mature for a nine year old. Well Tulsa, it is my job to find you a safe place to stay. Oh, you don't have to. I'm going to stay with my father. - Your father? - Mmh mmh. I don't seem to have any information on your father. Do you know where you lives or his name? Have you ever met him before? No, but I found his picture of him in my mama's Bible. That's mama and that's my father. Is your father's name Tommy? All right boss, we're out of here. We'll see you on Monday. Hey Tommy, you good?

I'm sorry I know it's late but we need to meet up. Now is not a good time. I have your daughter. You said I have a daughter? I'm fine by the way, thank you for asking. And yes like I told you, this little girl claims you're her biological father. The only proof she has is this photo. She doesn't even know your name. Sandy? What happened to her? A motorcycle accident two years ago. You didn't know that? No. Wow, we had some crazy times. Yeah, I know. She wrote to me for a couple months after I deployed, but that was like 10 years ago. Tulsa is nine Tulsa? She has no other family. Her most recent placement was a really bad situation. So what do you want me to do? I'm not saying you're her father, but if you're willing, we can do some tests to confirm that. As for right now, she just really wants to meet you. Then what? I don't even like kids. I am in no position to be a father. Then just be her friend. So, that's Tulsa. - What's she doing? - Praying. - For what? - Probably for you. Come on. Are you all right? Be careful next time okay? Tulsa sweetie, this is Tommy Colston. My father! Tommy wanted to meet you. Yeah. You look different than your picture, you're scrappy. Tulsa sweetie, Tommy has agreed to do some tests to see if he's your father. He doesn't have to, he is. It's time for me to go home now. Look kid, I wouldn't be good for you right now, trust me. It sounds like we've got a lot of work to do. I'll get my things. What's happening? Let's just take her to your place and show her. So this is my garage. It's filthy. It's a garage. You own this place? No, I rent this place. I live in the apartment upstairs. Is this it? Hey, kid wait! I wasn't expecting company. Forever? Okay, I'll stay. She can't, I mean you wouldn't? Tulsa sweetie, it's not that simple. No. You don't have a place for me to stay, but it's okay now, I found my father. Sweetie, it's much more involved than that. That's right, yeah, tell her. I mean, there needs to be meetings, interviews, background checks. And I'll definitely fail those, all of them. I mean, this place needs to be cleaned up and inspected. We'll be ready. Don't worry, we'll fix you. Is my room down there? Don't! You can't just leave her here. She's right, we don't have any place for her to stay. Just for a little while until I figure this out. I know you, you'll take great care of her. Are you serious? What do I do with her? The Tommy Colston I know is a charmer, charm her. Charm her? You left her with him? There was nowhere else for her to go. Besides, he's her father. You don't know that for sure. A non emergency DNA test takes six to eight weeks, maybe even longer. There's not even anyone who can vouch for this man. I know Tommy. I will vouch for him and I will constantly check on them. If anything happens to this child, it's your license on the line or worse. Jaylene, Jaylene did you hear me? Yes, I hear you I'm all unpacked! Great. Where you in the Army? The Marines. What's the difference? How much time do we have? You know, you shouldn't smoke or drink? It'll kill you. So will children. Can I ask you some questions? Do I have a choice? Are you a criminal? No. What's your favorite color? Black. What's your favorite movie? "Black bear". What do you do for fun? Yoga. Do you have a girlfriend? Nope. Do you want one? Nope. If you weren't a mechanic, what would you be? Life coach. You know, you're a little Didi you know that? What's a Didi? So what you got there? Ooh, I get it, that's yours, that's cool. It's mama's Bible. All the answers you'll ever need in life are in this book. Did you love my mama? Yeah. Me and your mom had a lot of fun. She called those her wild days before she found Jesus. I didn't know He was missing. Everybody needs Jesus. He's needed here. Yeah, well, it's getting a little too crowded in here if you asked me. Well, I'm going back to bed. You think you can find something to do? Wake me up only if the place catches fire and do not touch anything, anything. What are you doing? Getting ready for the inspection. They're all gone. What's gone? All your alcohol and cigarettes. I threw them out. What the hell? Language, you should have your mouth washed out with soap for that. Whisky's stronger. Look little Didi. My name is Tulsa. I don't care. I told you to stay out of my stuff. It's time to get clean and organized. Are you gonna help or not? What are you doing now? Laundry. What do you know about laundry? As much as you know about being a parent. I told you, I got rid of all your alcohol, including everything you hid. I gotta go. You don't need that stuff! - Hey Jaylene. - Hey Tommy, how's Tulsa doing? She's upstairs probably sprinkling Holy water all over the place. She's trying to make a home. Can't she stay with you? Unfortunately no, she can't. Besides, I believe every girl needs a father. Call me if you need anything tonight, I'll check in on you tomorrow. Tommy, Tommy? Yeah I know this must be a shock, but you got this. Yeah. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in the green pastures. He leads me beside the still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness through His namesake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm awesome. ♪ Amazing grace how sweet the sound ♪ ♪ That saved a wretch like you ♪ Quiet! It's time for church. There are no churches in this town. You're lying, now get up. I made breakfast. I'm not going to know any church. And take a shower, you stink! You stink. And shave that scruff. I'm gonna drop you off at the orphanage. So, from now on I do the laundry. I told you I got rid of them. Of course. Since you're not going to church, I made a list of chores for you. You can start by mowing the grass. I may have saved one pack of cigarettes. If you mow the grass, I'll tell you where I hid them. I'm not playing your little games understand? Come on, there's still some left. Gimme me my cigarettes. This and that. What? No, just give me my cigarettes. You'll get the rest once you do that. Don't forget to do this part. Hold on, I'll give you a ride. - Hop on. - No. What's wrong now? It's not safe, you're not wearing a helmet. You even know where you're going? God will lead me. God will lead you. You can't just walk in there, it's not your church. That's the cool thing about church, it's for everyone. Come on, you'll see. No thanks. Hey, I'll meet you out front after the service, okay? How's Tulsa this morning? Oh, she's great. She's just giving Jesus honor. Jaylene, I don't know how much longer I can do this. She is the most stubborn, arrogant, hardheaded, know it all I've never met. It sounds like someone else I know. That reminds me, we need to register her for school tomorrow. Wait, does that mean she's staying? Just for the time being. Try to make the best of it. Goodbye Tulsa. You keep praising the Lord. Tommy! My dear, you were a gift from my heavenly Father this morning. Thank you Bishop Franklin. Are you the father of this wonderful little girl? That's what they tell me. Well sir, you have a little angel here. Yep, my little angel. I hope to see you again. Not so fast, get on. I told you it's not safe. Trust me. Ta-dah! Put your bible. All right, throw it up here.

Listen Didi, I'm not scared of anything. I just know it doesn't work. How do you know? I just know. Maybe God's at work right now and you just don't see it. Okay, can I ask you a question? Go ahead, shoot. That foster mom, did she hurt you? It's okay if you don't wanna talk about it. Michael, he's my foster brother. He had an accident in the bed that night. We tried to wash the sheets before she found out, but she caught me. You did the right thing. This Michael, he means a lot to you? He's very special to me. You want some more? Maybe we should go home. Good idea. Let me help. There! It's a really sad painting. You should go to bed, you have school tomorrow. Who's Lisa? I said go to bed. Look, you wanted a dad, well I'm being a dad, go! Listen, if anyone comes in, get payment. I'm bleeding here and now with Tulsa. Someone shows up, says you're a daddy and you believe 'em? I mean, I'd want proof. Yeah well, they're doing tests. How long have you known Tommy? My entire life. How old are you? 35. ID. You ever done time? I'd rather not talk about it. Who's the lady? She's my sister. What's her name? Trixy. Well, if you are a nice brother, you'd buy Trixy some clothes. Come on Tulsa, time for school. We'll continue this later. Man, who is that kid? What's wrong? It's just, do I have to go? Well, if it were up to me, I'd teach you how to rebuild a carburetor and I'd put your butt to work. What now? I've been in five different schools since mama died. The girls can be kind of mean. Mean like, mean how? Like they beat you up? Yes, but with their words. Well, you may not wanna tell everyone at the lunch table they're going to hell. Save that for your second day. Okay, look kid you gotta treat school like prison. Go up to the biggest, baddest girl and punch her in the face. Okay no, not really. But, yes punch her in the face. It's all in the attitude. You know I got an idea. We've got to make a quick stop before we go to school, okay? I do have other appointments Ms. Sanders. Mr. Colston's a new father. I'm sure he just wants to make sure everything's okay for Tulsa's first day. Principal Workman, this is Tommy Colston and Tulsa. - What's up? - What's up? - I mean good morning. - Good morning. Well, let's go ahead and get started. Tulsa, this is Riley. You'll be shadowing her on your first day. Hi Tulsa, I like your jacket. Thanks. She's gonna be okay right? She will. You're doing fine Tommy. Establish a routine, pick her up everyday at the same time, help her with her homework. Foster kids like her are really sensitive to anything that triggers feelings of abandonment. I clearly don't know what I'm doing. I gotta get this, one second. I can't believe it! By the way, did you guys see that new girl in the leather jacket? I hope she doesn't get grease all over us. I know right? Hi girls. You better watch what you say. That little grease monkey is my daughter and the last three little brats who teased her mysteriously disappeared. I know right? Like they disappeared, disappeared. Psychopath! It's nice that you're defending Tulsa, but let's try not to threaten any more minors okay? It was just a pep talk. Tulsa! Forgotten. Oh, it's so sad when that happens. My ride is just late. Maybe your dad got arrested. Yeah, he's probably in jail. I'll tell him to say hi to your mom. Oh, I got the cutest dress for the daddy, daughter dance. We're going shopping this weekend. Are you and your dad going? Of course not, her dad can't even remember to pick her up. Tulsa, Tulsa, Tulsa wait up! I'm sorry, I was working. Time just got away from me. Just say it. Say what? That I don't mean anything to you. That's not true. Then why didn't you look for me? Look for you? I knew you'd be here. Not here, when I was born. I didn't even know you existed. You didn't want to know. Fathers are supposed to be there always, no matter what. They're supposed to protect their kids, play with them, teach them things. I can't even ride a bike. Hold up. I had this stupid dream that I knew you would love me and take care of me. I feel so stupid. Just go and ask Ms. Jaylene to take you somewhere else. What? I know I'm a lot to handle and a pain. I get it. Just tell me the truth. No, I want you to stay. I'm sorry kid, it's my fault. I'll do better, I promise. That's easy to say. You never got a chance to be a kid did you? We're gonna take care of that. So how was school? You knock out any bullies? Arg, school is overrated. You know what they say? C's get degrees. Ms. Jaylene went a different way with her advice. What's that? Some daddy, daughter dance at your school. What do you say? You and me, let's go. Mama says dancing leads to fornication. Fornication? Do you even know what that means? Okay no, but I know it's bad. Well, not all dancing is bad Didi. You gotta have a little fun. No I'm not going. And why do you keep calling me Didi? You can't dance. That's it, you can't dance. Listen, I'll teach you. You will be the coolest kid on the dance floor, I promise. Come on. We still have a lot to do before the inspection. We should hurry. Yes ma'am, but just remember the rhythm is gonna get you. No, seriously, it is going to get you. Tommy, what's the capital of Alaska? What? The capital of Alaska? I need to know for homework. Let me think. You okay? Give me a second. Yeah, I'm okay kid. I'm clean. So you say Jesus, He's always with us? Yeah. So is He here with this now? Right. Like right here? No, right here. Wow. - Colston. - Mr. Garcia. Mr. Garcia? I thought you forgot about all my name. I mean, I haven't received any rent check in the last three months. What's up with that? You'll get your rent. I just need a little time to collect on some invoices that's it. Who's that? That's my kid. - Tiny, can you? - Tulsa, let's take a break and go out back. Listen, you have until the end of the month or you're out that's it, okay? You'll get your rent. You better! Hey, watch what you're doing. Tiny, when's the last time you washed your hands. What's today? Last week. Tommy, dinner's ready! Dinner's ready! Tommy? Tommy wake up, wake up! I'm sorry Lisa It's me Tulsa! Tommy, wake up! You've got to beat this Tommy. You were doing so good. I'm sorry. Promise me you'll get help. I don't wanna lose you Tommy. I'm not gonna lose you either. I didn't deserve that. No, no you didn't, but it's what you needed. Tommy Colston, good to see you again young man. Bishop. What's a little grease among friends. Hey Tulsa! Actually, I'm here to see you. You know, I've been exactly where you are right now. Yeah? Where's that? Lost, we're all in the same boat my friend. When I was in the Army, I was a mess. I used to get so drunk and I'd wake up in some nowhere bar and walk half the day looking for my car. I would too if I joined the Army. All right. With all due respect Bishop, I believe there's a God, I do. I just don't trust Him. Life, it's just a big storm. There's no lighthouse. There once was a man who was shipwrecked in middle of the sea. He was in a fierce storm and he just knew he was gonna die. So he cried out, "God save me!" And all of a sudden, his ship caught fire. He jumped overboard and clutching to a piece of a hull, I mean angry and scared. And he cried out again, "Why did you abandon me? "I asked for help and you burnt my ship." And all of a sudden, this huge ship just cuts right through the storm and pulls the man to safety. And the captain said to the man, "It's a good thing that your ship caught fire "'cause if it hadn't, we never would have seen you." God's ways are above our ways. His thoughts above our thoughts. Who can know the mind of God? God could have wiped us all out, the whole human race. But instead he said, "No, they are worth it." God doesn't need us, He wants us. That's why Jesus came and died on the cross. We're saved by love Tommy. It doesn't always come in the form of a lighthouse or lightning in the sky. Sometimes our ship needs to burn before we're rescued. And sometimes the answer just may come in a small voice. I really need to get this car done if that's okay with you. I'm gonna leave this for you right here, just in case. I recommend you start with the book of John. Tulsa, Tulsa! Sorry kid. Hey kid. I'll take care of you. It's what I'm afraid of. Practicing your moves? I wasn't dancing, I was. How do I look? You still have your scruff, but you look good. Like a nice criminal. I look GQ Didi, GQ. Don't forget that. - Hello Ms. Murray. - Mrs. Murray. Mr. Colston, Tulsa. Hello. Now, Ms. Jaylene has given me a little background on your situation. How's everything been going? Everything's great, right Tommy? Of course, we are blessed. Just so blessed to be here with God in our hearts. What Tommy is trying to say is that we are very blessed to have found one another. Yes, yes, praise Him, praise Him! For we are blessed. Shall we sit? Please, my chair. Yes ma'am. Thank you. Yes ma'am. Are you hot Mr. Colston? Yeah, yeah, I'd like to think that I am. No, you seem flushed. Are you nervous? - Yes. - No. - No - Yes. Tommy's not been feeling well. The flu maybe. I'm sorry, excuse me. Perhaps I should reschedule. No Ms Kerry, I know this place is not normal and Tommy's really nervous right now, but he's a really good father. Sure, he's far from perfect, but each day he wakes up and works harder than the last. Please, give us a chance. Tell Mr. Colston, I hope he gets better really soon and I mean really soon. Yes ma'am, he will. Thank you Mrs. Murray! Ms. Jaylene will be in contact with you until I'm able to do a good home study. - Goodbye, for now. - Bye! Tommy. Oh hello, can I please speak to Mr. Chainsaw? Oh hello, my name is Trixy at Colston customs. I know, I sound a lot younger than I am. I just wanted to let you know that you have been entered in a chance to win a custom bike. Yes, yes that's right. We're having the drawing here at the garage but you need to be here to win. Bring two forms of ID, oh and a credit card. Thank you, thank you, thanks, thank you, thank you very much. What's all this. Oh, it's a drawing they're having for a custom bike. - Drawing? - Mmh mmh. Excuse me. Okay, I don't know what's going on here, but we are not giving anything away. Where's Trixy? Yeah, Trixy will know. I am Trixy. Tulsa, what are you doing? Getting the rent money. - You lied? - No, Trixy lied. Tiny, help me up. Thank you all for coming, but I must confess, there's no drawing. This is bull, I'm leaving. You can't leave. I have all your keys, but you'll all get them back once everyone here has paid their bill. What are you talking about? I paid JB when I picked up my bike last week. Me too! I paid him in cash. I always pay my bills. JB, you stealing from me? I gave you the money. You were just so strung out, you probably don't remember. Is everyone lying? Search him Tiny. Come on, hey! Yo, I was keeping this place running before that little brat showed up. If you ever talk about my daughter like that again, you will leave here on a stretcher. Okay, this ain't over Tommy. Give them their keys back Trixy. Take your keys. Tulsa, you can't do that again. It worked didn't it? I'll make dinner. Wait, it's been a great week. First the inspection, now the rent, we're going out to celebrate. Can I invite someone? Was your pizza good? Yeah. Do you want another piece? No. Kerry wasn't 100% convinced, but you are safe for the time being which is good enough. To good enough. - Cheers! - To good enough, cheers! What's wrong? I think the ice cream's spoiled. Mine tastes fine. Smell it. I can't believe I fell for that. Rookie move Tommy, rookie move. What was Tommy like in high school? Oh, here we go. He was a renegade, always cutting it up in the parking lot with his friends, challenging authority. Okay, she's heard enough. But, this one time after school my truck wouldn't start and your father saw me crying and he came over and he asked me to pop the hood. He fixed it in like two minutes. The red silver auto? Mmh mmh, it was my father's. He had passed a year before. I remember that? Didi, this song, it's time for your first dance lesson. - No. - Come on. No way. Whoa, whoa, what is all this? Tell this one here to go to the daddy, daughter dance with me. I don't wanna go, okay. She doesn't wanna go because she can't dance. Oh well, I would've loved to have gone to a dance with my father. Come on, let's show her how it's done. ♪ I feel it inside my soul ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Something was missing but now I'm whole ♪ ♪ I found my family ♪ ♪ When I'm with you I know I'm home ♪ ♪ Ooh oh oh ooh ♪ Dear Michael, I miss you so much.

I love you very, very much, love Tulsa. P.S., remember, don't eat the crayons, they give you diarrhea. There you are. Tiny needs your help. Why did you lie to me? Lie to you? What are you talking about? I haven't had a drink, no cigarettes, no pills. No, why did you lie about me? You knew about me all along. Wait a second. Where's this coming from? I found this in your desk drawer. I told you to stay out of my stuff. You knew I was out there. You didn't care one bit. This isn't you. Then who is it? This is my son. I have a brother? Where is he? He's gone. Where'd he go? I told you to stay out of my stuff. This is none of your business. Tommy, stop! - Hey handsome! - Hey. So what'd they say? Well, I figured out what's wrong with me. And? I'm pregnant. Pregnant? Yeah, the clinic thinks I'm about four months. It's a boy! She said he looks healthy. I mean, of course I have to go see a real baby doctor. You should come. Yeah, you should definitely come, if you want to. Hey, tell me you're happy? Tommy, I need to hear you say it. Okay look, we'll stop everything. We'll get clean. I've already got my meds adjusted. I can get my moods under control, I promise. Really, just like that? Tommy, I want this. I want it with you. This is your son. Is it? What? What do you mean? Tommy, talk to me. Get rid of it. You don't mean that. Lisa, it's me. I'm sorry, I was stupid. Please just come home. We'll figure all this out. Just come home, please.

She did sustain several injuries, now the least of which is the one to her head. Now, that's the one I'm concerned about. She has a major subdural hematoma. What is that? It's bleeding inside the skull, around the brain. It causes a lot of pressure. We have to relieve that pressure. I wanna see her. Yeah, and you can but not now. What your little girl needs right now is a lot of rest. What she doesn't need is any sort of stimulation, okay. So I want you to wait here and I'll keep you posted. - All right. - Hey look, I'm sorry that this happened. - Thanks Doc. - Yeah. Is everything okay? Mr. Colston, you may go in and see your daughter now, but just so you know, she's still not awake, okay. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Right this way. I'm here Didi, daddy's here. Excuse me sir, could you give me a moment? Come home Tulsa. Okay, she's finally awake, but she's a very sick little girl, all right. But she's demanding to see you. Now, before you go in there, I want you to know that your daughter has a very long road ahead of her. So, take it easy on her, all right? - All right. - Sure. - Thanks Doc. - You're welcome. I missed you. I looked both ways twice, I did. It's not your fault. My head, it hurts really bad. I know it does. We're gonna get you fixed, okay. I don't know if I can. Yes, you can. You're a fighter Didi. Here, we're in this together Didi. Why do you call me Didi? I'll make you a promise, when you get out of here, I'll tell you. Deal? Deal. I'm gonna take care of you. That's what I'm afraid of. I love you. I love you too. Hey there. Bishop Franklin! - Tommy. - Bishop. You up for a visit? Good, 'cause I brought some friends with me. You liked the so much the first time you came to our church, I thought that we'd come and sing it for you today.

Sorry I'm late. How is she today? Her head, she's still in a lot of pain. You think that's what Dr. Holden wanted to see us about? I don't know. This is for you. - Mr Colston. - Doc. Let's talk. Okay, Tulsa is not responding to treatment. The pressure is not being relieved in her brain as we had hoped it would. The pressure is just too great. Now, if this should continue, she is going to slip into an actual coma. Yeah, but she seemed to be improving last week. I understand that but sadly it's not uncommon for a patient to rally right before a major setback. So what do we do? I mean, there's gotta be some options. Yes, there's a procedure that we can do to relieve the pressure but I need to tell you that this procedure can be fairly risky. How risky? I'd give it a 50% chance of healthy recovery. And the other 50? That would be either permanent paralysis or worse. So what you're saying is if we do nothing Tulsa dies. And if we have this procedure she could also die. I understand that this is not good news, but it is what we're dealing with. In the meantime, what we'll do is we'll manage Tulsa's pain as well as we can. We'll do everything we can to relieve the pressure on her brain and we will hope for the best. But, right now I do recommend that you have a serious conversation with Tulsa, thank you. - I'll do it. - Tommy. She's my daughter, I'll tell her. We need to pray for a miracle. ♪ He's always there with me ♪ ♪ Even if I don't see ♪ ♪ He'll catch me if I fall ♪ ♪ He'll be with me through it all ♪ ♪ He'll catch me if I fall ♪ ♪ He'll be with me ♪ Do you understand? I think so. It's okay to be scared. I'm not scared. I mean, I wanna see Jesus and mama. I really do but. But what? I don't wanna leave you. Will you forget me? Forget you? Are you crazy? Forget my own? I would forget my own name before I forget you. Besides, we're gonna beat this. You're not in this alone. I just wanna let you know, you're the best dad in the whole world. I love you Tommy Colston. And I want you to remember this moment, remember me, right here. I know I don't deserve you. You're the most precious person God could've ever brought into my life. I wish I could make all this go away. I love you. Pain management seems to be going fine, but Tulsa is really not responding to the treatment so if you're gonna opt for the procedure, you need to tell me sooner rather than later. I've talked to Tulsa and she's willing to risk it. Okay good. I'm gonna schedule her for Saturday. What can I do? What you can do young lady is you can make sure this one goes home and get some rest that's doctor's orders. He's right, when's the last time you were home? Tiny has got the garage under control. I'm not talking about the garage, I'm talking about you and your health. You need rest. When he gets my daughter to be okay. You heard the doctor said to go home and get some sleep. I will. Tell me, if you could do anything in the world right now, what would it be? That's easy, I'd go to the daddy, daughter dance with you. I wish we could, but you know we can't. She's asleep, why don't you just go home for the night? My home is when I'm with her. Yeah, but you're no good to her or anybody else if you go down with exhaustion. Now, come on and get yourself up out of here. I'll call you if anything changes. It's okay. You gotta take care of you too. It's gonna be okay. Thanks nurse. Get some rest Tommy.
