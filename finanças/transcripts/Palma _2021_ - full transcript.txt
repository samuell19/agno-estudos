So that's where he's from. Come on, faster! What are you standing there for? Let's go! Come on, faster! Standing here... That way! Come on! Good day! - Good day! Didn't a dog run by here? Where is he? He's relieving himself. You think you can fly that crate of yours... until you retire? I can do it! Listen, Golikov. - What is it, Golikov? Guess what: Antique lamp with eleven letters. Well? Well? - "Arm candy." Don't take offense, it's not you. That's the name of the thing. No time to waste. It's not long until retirement. Come on! Nothing? Then take a closer look! He's in a huff. Well hello! You're all I need. Is that how it is? Wait a minute. Dear passengers. The plane is now coming in for a landing... in the heroic city of Moscow. In Moscow it's cloudy, 16 degrees, with clearings. Kolya? Kolya, the plane is going down. Fasten your seat belt, please. We are descending, please fasten your seat belts. Please fasten your seat belts. Yes! Comrade Lysko, we're going down. Please take your seats, and fasten your seat belts. Well, we'll be down soon. Be so good. Bring me a drink of water.

Extend the landing gear. Thank you. What's that? - Mineral water. What's the point? I asked you to bring me.., to bring me a "water". Flaps? - Extended. Signal lights on. Lights on. Captain! On the runway! What the hell! Obstruction on the track! Go for it! Full power! Retract landing gear! - Retract! Retract flaps! We're gaining altitude. Gosha, what was that on the track? I don't know. A dog, I think. Good afternoon. Welcome. Dear Comrade Lysko! Dear members of the foreign delegation! We are pleased to welcome you.., to welcome you to our airport... An embarrassment! And that in front of the foreigners! Comrade Lysko, your car. How was the flight? - It was fine. We almost crashed. Can we get out? - Please. Now we're going to the VIP lounge. It's a pigsty! - A pigsty... We'll fix that right away. Don't worry about it. Get that dog out of here! Tell Golikov to come here at once! There's a dog on apron 12. He's disturbing the passengers. Hurry up! Run! Away with you! Careful, he might bite. What a good dog. Goodbye! It's like the pound here! I'm going to complain! Look out! - What kind of dog is that? You hurt that dog! - I didn't mean to! Don't worry. Security's been called. What if he has rabies and he's about to bite us? There he is. That's the way to do it. - Who knows where the dog came from! You chase him from there. You, there! You come with me. Step aside! Don't scare the dog! What?! So, you mutt! Away with you! Look at him! Do not obstruct our work! Go on, chase him! What are you standing around for?! Chase him to me! Everybody off the bus! Quick! We'll chase him into the bus, and you close the doors! What?! Why on the bus? Come on! Get in there! Close it, Borja! Close it! - There we go! Borya, your door! There we go. That's it. Calm down! We caught the dog! Zounds! - He has no business here! In a moment. another bus for all of you. Kolya, why are you still sitting here? - I'm waiting for our flight back. Come on. The plane... ...is going in for maintenance. I know this is hard for you, but... ...we have to get along. Vyacheslav Yurievich, we must... Excuse me. You have to sign, or there's gonna be trouble. Yes, of course. Kolya, wait for me outside! Ladies and gentlemen! I understand! But we're doing our job here! Dad! Don't run away! Calm down, comrades! I know that dog. He's not dangerous. His master left him behind, and now he's looking for him. Let the dog out, please. Give me a hand. - No! He's rabid and evil! Maybe we should call Call Blue Cross? This is taking too long. I'll get the shotgun. Stop! Are you crazy? There are people here! Let's do this without a gun. - My orders are: Animals on airport property are to be shot down. What? - Look at me. So? - Are you human? Quiet. Take it easy. Easy, easy, easy. Don't worry. Quiet. I'm not gonna hurt you. Quiet. DOORS Halt! That dog! - He's a beauty! Don't just stand there! Catch him! Who was that? You? Come here! Zhenya, calm down! I'll pull his ears and calm down! Why do you want to... to pull his ears out? He's a child, but he knows that man's dog is his friend. Get out of here! Mind your own business! Stop it! - We work here! What's going on here? Vyacheslav Yurievich, ask them what's going on! My instructions are: no animals! That snot-nosed son of a bitch let that dog onto the tarmac! What's going on here! Who are you, anyway? - All right. Borya! Open the doors! Ladies and gentlemen, get on the bus. Standing around on the tarmac is not allowed. Get in! I'll take care of the boy. - You don't have to. With my son. I can handle myself. Come on, Kolya. Thank you. - "No pasaran." Vyacheslav Yurievich! This is against the order! What are you talking about, Slava? are you talking about, Slava? You had Lysko and the foreign delegation on board! In three years... we'll have the Olympics! Lysko gets pressure from above! He prances around for the whole world to see, to show how glorious our country is! You should have wrapped that dog around the landing gear! At this speed, you can't tell if it's a dog or something else. We saw an animal on the runway. What if it had been a moose? What the hell! A moose, Slava? Last year, they fired a pilot who ran down a moose. The landing gear was wrecked. All survived only by a miracle. What are you telling me? Don't take that tone with me! Slava, what's the matter with you? Sorry, I overreacted. I took my son from Sverdlovsk. You have a son? Now I do. Who's the mother? She died. Well, uh... Pull yourself together, and get better. In a month, you'll have your first international flight. I signed it. The brass... will be signing it later this week. Thank you, Lyubov Arkadyevna. Then there's a test flight with a new plane, tests... AEROFLOT Slawa? Don't blow it. Now get out of here! - Yes, sir. Oh! I thought they drove you out of here a long time ago, these cowboys. What have you got there? A ball? Give me that. Got it. In principle, they are right. Dogs have no business here. You know what I mean? But since you obviously you have a very strong reason... Wait a minute. "Will you take "take the watch. Here you go. Make yourself comfortable. Come on. Au... I was wrong when I called you a fool. Come on in. There's the living room. Take off your shoes. So... I put the ice cream in the freezer. Why don't you take a look around... ...take a look around. These are photos from the pilot academy. Aircraft... We can put fish put in the aquarium. A globe... Well... Let's get something to eat. Don't touch the atlas! Don't touch it! He's very old. The sofa pulls out. There's bedding underneath. Did your mother teach you to make up a bed? - Hai her. That's good. Then make your bed now. It's getting late. Off to bed. Hello. When's the next flight to next flight to Sverdlovsk? In 20 minutes. the check-in desk will close. And how much is a ticket? - 32 rubles. Where are your parents, boy? Without parents. I'm not selling you a ticket. We're... Yes. There they are. I'll get them. David! Come here! There was a strange boy here. He wanted to buy his own ticket to Sverdlovsk himself. Check it out. - I'll check. Dasha, stay close to us. Thank you. - Go on through. Hello. - Please go through. Hey, half! Where's your ticket? I'm with them. - Excuse me! Yes? - Is this your son? Son? No. I have a daughter. Boy! Where are you, boy? What son again? - It was a mix-up. Mistaken identity? Like last time? - Calm down, Tamara! There was a boy here... ...tried to get on a plane without a ticket. I'm sure he's hiding around here somewhere. A stray. Men! Have you seen... ...seen a boy? You look around here, and I'll look over there. All right, we'll search the place. Keep quiet! Shut up! Go away! Get along with you! Keep it down! Be quiet now! Hold it, boy! Stop, boy! It's dangerous here! If I catch you.., I'm gonna rip your head off! Quiet! What do you want? Shut up now! I'm coming! Nikolai Lazarev. Moment. Hello. Gosha, they're not pulling us from the flight. I'll be there soon. I can do it! And does he have any special characteristics? - I think not. Eye color? - Gray. Or brown. So, gray or brown? - Can't remember. Is this your son or... - Not yours, that's for sure! Excuse me. He's my son. Since yesterday. Yes! Is he with you? Sergei Pavlovich! - Vyacheslav Yurievich! Don't worry. It's all good. They're asleep. - "They"? Well, he... with this... I found her here. The dog won't go away. It warms him. So, uh... Maybe we shouldn't wake her. and let her sleep? Kolya! Look up! Look up now! Look up! I'm late for my flight because of you! What are you doing here anyway? - What's it to you? Why did you leave the house? - My house is in Sverdlovsk, right? I wanted to fly away. - Oh, you... Come on! You hear me? - Let go of me! Don't touch me! Vyacheslav Yurievich! Don't make me do it! You don't have a house in Sverdlovsk, do you understand? No mother! No house! And the end! Shut your trap! How were you gonna fly there, you wise guy? In the baggage compartment? In the undercarriage. Go, Vyacheslav Yurievich. You have a flight to catch. I'll stay here with him. If he's not here in five minutes, she'll put Solotaryov on the flight. If there's anything, it's Solotaryov. Is she in love with him? In love or not, it doesn't matter. As long as we don't get pulled off Flights. Good afternoon. Where is he? - Who? Oh, Vyacheslav Yurievich? There. - Where's "there"? On the plane. Where else? Go easy on him, Lyubov Arkadyevna. Krasilov! - He became a father yesterday! Wait! What's wrong, Krasilov? You got something on your back. Turn around a little. What is it? - A cross spider! No sudden movements! The spider is very dangerous and poisonous! I'll tear them to pieces! What a beast! I'm gonna get her! That's it! I've crushed them to dust! That's it. There you go! Hello, Lyubov Arkadyevna. - How do you do? Good morning, Lyubov Arkadyevna. Has something happened? Let me through! - Please! I never dreamed that I would be... ...I'd be helping Lasarev out. Kolya! This is my "Cucaracha". Do you like it? I'm looking for someone to help me fix it. How about you? Sit at the table. There's butter and bread. Something like that. She chose you. She won't let anyone get close to her, except you. There's something about you. I don't think she should... I don't think she should let me near her. I couldn't fly away because of you. Were you seriously going to fly in the landing gear? Yes. But surely you know ...what altitude an airplane climbs to... And what kind of temperature at 10,000 meters above sea level? That dog saved your life. You want coffee? That's right. It's not healthy for children. Your sweater, though... Do you want Nina to wash it? I see. Did your mother knit it? I know, Kolya. It's very hard.., to lose loved ones. The main thing is not to despair. Dad! Hello. - Hello. Lazarev asked me.., to keep an eye on him. Of course. What are you hiding? - I'm not hiding anything. Well, I made some coffee! But it's for Kolia! For Nikolai! Drink. Why are you making such a fuss in front of the kid? What did the doctor tell you, Dad? That coffee is not good for you! Why do you drink it all the time? Am I a little boy? Yes, Dad, because you don't listen! Instead of yelling at me, you could iron my shirts. I don't have time for this. - Quiet! Why should I be quiet? - Quiet! The IL-18 is landing! Now look. She's gonna run. I knew it! And straight to the stand. Can she tell by the sound? She doesn't do that on any other aircraft. And why is that? - Fifty-fifty. Her master flew to Prague on that plane to Prague yesterday. He didn't take her. What's her name? I wasn't listening closely. Alma... Palma... But the name of that bastard... I remembered. Missing someone, Palma? I'm missing someone, too. This is my luggage. I'll take that as hand luggage. I can't do that. - I can't check this in as luggage. I'll tell you again. - Listen to me. I'm gonna make sure... It's too big for carry-on luggage. - Well? - Excuse me. Lunch break. Well? Wait. What do you want, kid? - I need a passenger's address. Why do you need the address of a passenger? He left his dog here. The dog longs for him very much. I want to write him a letter, telling him to pick it up. Where do you want me to get them? I need his passport details. I know his name: Polski. I still can't give it to you. Only with an official request from the militia. Like if he's done something wrong... or a relative's looking for him. A dog is like a relative. - That doesn't count! Those are the rules! - But why? When you're older, you'll understand! Hello. So? Hello. Come on! - Let go of me! What are you doing here? Excuse me. Get out of here! Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here! Apron 12. The dog's back. Come, please. Shoo! Get out of here! Shoo, I said! Apron 12. Security! The dog is back! What are you... Where are your parents? - I don't have parents! Take it easy! Lying is not good. You're Kolja. - Yes. You see? The son of Lasarev. Now what? - Nothing. Why are you hanging around? Waiting for your daddy? This isn't... not a playground. What do you want me to do with you? MOSCOW That's it, pal. Give me the net. Quiet! Quiet! Where's he going? Get him, damn it! Where's he going? To the other side! Get him! Faster! Ladies and gentlemen, this is just a drill! Get him! Faster! Halt! Where are you going? Get him! Again, this is a very delicate cargo! A souvenir! How do I know what's going on in your cargo hold? Suitcases can get away! There! There you are! It's a zoo! And you say he doesn't bite! There's a dog. Oh, dear. Where are they? Over here! Surround! Keep calm, comrades! - Calm down! There he is. - Go! What are you doing? Come here! Surround! Wait. Leave the dog alone! Go away! You again! What do you want to do? Run away! Run away, Palma! Now you've gone too far. Run! There he is! Oh, my God! What are you standing there for? - Hold this. Better catch the dog, damn it! You all right? - Yeah. The porter on duty... is asked to go to the baggage department. Check the departure lounges! Quiet. Here. This is what you asked for. Take it. Go through that door. After the stairs, there's a door on the right. to the outside. There's no one there. Come on! Thank you, Valera. See you tomorrow. ...I'm gonna eat pomodore! Vyacheslav Yurievich, where will the first trip go? Solotaryov's troupe says to Prague. - Beautiful. How do they know? I'd rather go to Istanbul. Istanbul? Nah. I'd rather go to the West. To Japan. If you fly west long enough.., eventually you'll get to Japan. That's enough! - I'd like to... Take a little boost, you dreamers. We still have the test flight and the test. Look. There they glide, like a sunbeam. Give my regards to the little flying creature. No more dogs on the track? Not a single one, Comrade Solotaryov. The great flying creature scared all the dogs away. Yes. The uniform fits perfectly, but the contents are no good. Vyacheslav Yurievich! They should come to Zhurina urgently! Captain, it's been an honour flying with you. To hell with you, Gosha. If your son loves the dog so much, then take him home! What dog? All you have to do is ask.., which son! What's at issue? Do you know how many complaints I've gotten from passengers? The dog's running around here, making a mess, messing up all the suitcases! It's a regular zoo here! And what have I got to do with it? Who let the dog out when he was already locked in the bus? Zhenya! Who? The son of Vyacheslav Yurievich. He thinks that's funny too! I'm a pilot! I am not a ground crew member! The head of security can't handle one dog? We have a statement... - Shut up! I really don't understand. What specifically am I being asked to do now? Concrete? I'll be specific! You find that dog. He's probably with your son. That's one. You'll take him personally to Blue Cross. That's two. And you give your son a stern rebuke. That to the third, let me get this straight. Slava, are you going to fly abroad... or is that it? I'm done! Should I mail it? The mail's on its way home. Thanks, I'll do it myself. Hello, everyone. Kolya, come here. - What for? Vyacheslav Yurievich! Coffee? Bread voucher fairy? Thank you, no. Come here. Come on. Oh, the cowboy. Let go of me! Don't touch me! Let me go, I said! Please don't! - Where's the dog? There, under the wagon. - Please don't touch Palma! Let me go, I said! - Make sure he doesn't run away. Still got tanks on their backs? Approach with caution. - Don't scare him off. Don't touch her! - Hold the boy! Hold the boy! Do not frighten the animal! Let go of me! - Listen to me! Quiet! Let him go! Get away from that dog! Young lady! - Get away from that dog! What are you doing? I'm on a mission! What's going on here? What's all this fuss about? Get to work! Orders from Schurina! Sit down. What's not clear here? - Yes, yes, order. Go ahead. - Then get out of the way! Pull tight! Come on! Tighten up! Leave her alone! Stop it! Kolya, this has to be done! - Leave her alone! This won't do! Come on, pull hard! Pull! To the car! Let go! - Guide him! Let go! - Hurry! Open up! She didn't do anything to you! Leave her alone! You are welcome! Leave her here! Let's go! Palma! Palma! If I were Kolya, I would hide I'd hide from you in the undercarriage, too. Vyacheslav Yurievich. As long as I'm still here, ...don't let me see you... ...don't show your face around here again. In the water there are Germs, too, by the way. You have to treat it with peroxide. Kolya, come out! And where are you going? Too bad it wasn't your flight. What flight? With which I wanted in the landing gear to fly away. Why is that? That would have been great, especially on your plane, to freeze to death or... or getting squished. And you would have flown... and you wouldn't have known about it. Take off that stupid sweater! Take it off, I said! - That's Mom's sweater! Don't touch me! Who are you, anyway? I don't know you. Have you visited me ...visit me once? Not one gift did you send me! Now I'll tell you something about that, ...and then we'll call it a day. The gifts you got... your mother made for you, with the money I've been sending her every month. And that makes you my dad? - Guess so! Sit down! Sit down! So, that's it. It'll heal soon. I'm still not gonna live with you. I hate you. Where are you going? - To the children's home. You will continue to fly in peace. And I will live in peace at the children's home. In the children's home? Do you have any idea what it's like to live in a home? I'll find out. All right, let's split up. But not until tomorrow morning. Go to sleep now. And in the morning, we'll find you a nice children's home. Dear Igor Petrovich. My name is Kolya. I am nine years old. I am writing to you from the airport in Moscow. From which you recently departed. You left Palma, your dog, left here. Palma's waiting for you. She does not want to leave the airport, Although one tries to drive them away. There's already been a real hunt... has already begun. Palme is very smart. She is not only smarter than other dogs. I think she's smarter than a lot of people, too. smarter than a lot of people. Every day she walks to the runway, to greet the plane. With which you flew away. How she recognizes that so exactly, I haven't figured out yet. Quiet, you mutts! And though she's so smart, Can't understand her, why you left her here. I don't understand it either. But I know that without you... it's very hard for her. She'll never stop waiting for you. She will never give up. She will wait until the last, Even if it costs them their lives. Because to them you are their family. It's raining cats and dogs! I'd better clear the cages! Everything is completely overcrowded! Men, quickly! The dogs are running away! Get them! Go! Nothing is worse than realizing.., that your parents have abandoned you. and have forgotten, as if you didn't exist. That's why I'm asking you: Please come here, and pick up Palma. Get in. - I'm walking. Kolya, you're going to be sick. Get in. We're bringing Palma back. Do you understand Russian? - Don't shout at me! Again, I don't know! - Why are you yelling at me? Let me take the dog! - There are no dogs! Goodbye! Take that! - What happened? She's gone! She's not here! All the dogs have run away! Where do we look for her now? I know where she is. Let's go! What are you standing around for? Let's go! She'll find her way back. Maybe she's... What are you doing here? - I'm looking for a dog! What dog? - Have you seen Palma? I'll call security. - Let go of me! I said, "Nah. You buy me a drink, and we're even!" Great! Wait. Hold this. Varvara! You don't have to call anyone! He's with us! He's the son of Vyacheslav Yurievich. Well, you're on your way home again? on the way home? Warwara! It's all right. He's my son. - She's not here. Kolya! Varvara, please don't suck it up. Wait. We'll look for her. We'll put up a notice. She won't get away. It's gonna be okay. What a rascal. Kolya! Look! Your doing or did she escape herself? - She herself. Palma! Varvara Sergeyevna, don't report this, please. Otherwise, she'll be taken away again. Then take her with you, Vyacheslav Yurievich. Yes, she can live with us! With us? With you, I mean. And I'll take care of her.., until her master comes back. I, uh... Me, us, you... She's not leaving here anyway. Now she's running to the H-watch machine. What are we to do? Find your master. Until then we take care of them. I can do that! - You're tired. I am not! - Well, I am. My flight's in six hours. I need to sleep. Let's go home. Can I go with Sergei Pavlovich... fix the "Cucaracha"? I could use a helper. I'll keep an eye on him. Have a nice day. I'm going to bed. I'm on shift tonight. Nina, can I give you a ride home? - No, I'll walk. Don't refuse. Then you can sleep longer. Dad! Take her home, Vyacheslav Yurievich. I don't want her through the woods by herself. "There are miracles: The leprechaun walks there." And I'm worried! I'll be right back. Do you know what the cockroach in Spanish? How? - "Cucaracha." There was such a song. La cucaracha... We should put an ad in the paper About Palma. Good idea! Vyacheslav? - Yes. I'm Yuri the journalist. Where is the dog? The ad must state the full name of the master, so that friends or relatives can contact him. Excellent! To the side! They won't take her away again either? This appears on the last page. No one will notice. Right? - Yes. "Leashed to the tarmac!" Are you all right, Slava? Lyubov Arkadyevna, I... What did I say to that dog? Lazarev, you're out of line. You can forget about the international flights. You can forget about all the flights. Put your ticket on the table, and go play with dogs. Listen, Slava... - That's it, Slava! Zhurina! Yes, Comrade Lysko. Are you gonna take the picture or not? Ivan Romanovich, could you get a little closer? I can't stand dogs! I am allergic to them! Speed it up, I beg you! Is it that good? - Yeah, it's good. Raise your hand a little higher. Exactly. A little lower. Lower. Excellent. I'll take the picture. When I read About Palma, I realized.., that this dog is a real hero. Our country needs to know its heroes. Don't we? There we have it, the true Soviet loyalty. This dog... the whole world needs to know about. We need a plan so people can visit Palma. Here, next to the railroad, we're going to build a big, beautiful enclosure, so that the dog has everything everything he needs. She doesn't need an enclosure, she needs her master. - She needs her master. Oh, I forgot. Where is the pilot Lazarev? that helped Palma? - Here it is. Thank you! Here! This is the kind of employee we must be proud of. Comrade Zhurina. - Yes? There's got to be some... You've got to appreciate that somehow. Well, Comrade Lasarev is waiting... for permission to make international flights. Wonderful! Seconded. Wholeheartedly seconded. Thank you. -Thank you. And I would also like to address to the owner of the dog. Dear friend, come here, and pick up your companion. She was waiting for you... and will throw at you. That's it. I'm listening. No, the owner hasn't hasn't come yet. The dog? The dog is waiting. That's the dog from the newspaper article! No, he hasn't come yet. If I tell you. There's nothing wrong with the dog. Don't worry. - Yeah, he's at the airfield. No, the owner hasn't hasn't come yet. You asked yesterday.., how they're doing. And the day before yesterday, too. I know you by your voice. There's no reason to come here! There's nothing wrong with Palma! AT PALMA MOSCOW AIRPORT Good afternoon. Please continue to the bus. I'll go with you. Palma! Let's go! Here comes the next plane! Why aren't you eating? So many calls, but nobody knows anything about Polski. Can there be a human being without family and friends? It's gonna be okay. You said that before. Come on. Let's take a walk. - Where to? Name me any city in the world. Rome. Rome... Like this. Take my finger... ...and place it somewhere on the map. Where are we? - The Colosseum. Excellent. And where are we going? Left? Right? - To the left. We go to the left along Via dei Fori Imperiali, and we get to Piazza Venezia. From there we walk through the alleys to the Trevi Fountain. The most famous fountain in Rome. Everyone there wants something. Turn the page. Continuing along Via di San Vincenzo, until we reach the Pantheon. The temple of all gods. Do you know all of Rome by heart? The center, at least. - Do you know any other cities? I know all the cities that exist in this atlas. When I was a kid. I used to look at this atlas every night. With the flashlight, under the covers. Were you punished because you didn't sleep'? That happened. Sometimes I was beaten beaten with the strap. You had a strict mother, though. Not my mother. The governess. You know, the other boys laughed at me. But I knew.., when I grew up, I was going to be a pilot and visit all the cities in this atlas. Have you always walked alone through these cities? Well, there kind of wasn't anyone. I'd take Nina. If I could, I'd take Mom with me. But Nina's good too. I like her. So do I. - So what's the problem? Go eat. - Then stay alone. You sure know a lot! Casanova. I thought tonight... Nina. - Vyacheslav Yurievich. Hello! Are we still on a first name basis? Hello, Nina! - Hello. Nina, you're adorable today. - Thank you. Vyacheslav Yurievich, shall we wait for you? Gosha, look ahead! You might trip. What are you looking at? Rona! Come to me! My girl! Come on, come here! Don't be upset, my dear. Don't take it amiss. It's not my fault. I'm not allowed in. But I'm right next door. I'll see you in two hours. Palma, here comes your plane! Funny. She appears to be sick. I'll take a look at that. Yes. Her nose is cold. Come on! That's it. That's it. - Let go! Turn it over. Let go of the dog! - Didn't you hear me? I've been instructed that the dog is to remain within visual range. It's a living thing! You don't put it in a cage! Don't be stupid! And is that a cage? I would say "separate living space." Not even a biped... Not even a biped can do that. Here you have a wonderful view of the whole airport. Let her out! She's in a bad way here! What are you yelling about? I'm not holding the dog. Hey! Apparent death! Go ahead and play. Drive! Palma, honey. Why aren't you eating? Eat something. Poor dog. Arrhythmia. - What is it? The heart is not working properly. Is it because she's not eating? Yeah, too. But that's not the main reason. I would say.., that she's a particularly loyal dog, ...when she sacrifices her life... to her master like that. I'm just afraid that she won't make it through the night. What's his name? - Mikhail Okopovich. Mikhail Okopovich! Not only out of curiosity... Kolya, we need to talk. Let's go. Alma. Alma. Alma, it's me. Come to me. Alma. Come here, girl. Come. Palma, get up! Let's go home, Palma! Look up, I said! Palma, let's go. You're all wet. Let's go. Please! Let's go home! You're gonna live with me, you understand? Look up now and go! You will live with me! I'm gonna pick you up, and you're gonna start walking, you understand? Look up! Look up! Please, Palma! Look up! Look up! You're stupid! I hate you! You were just left behind by your master. But my mama died. What am I to do? Lie down and die too? I'd rather die too... ...than living here with you. You're all leaving me. You too. Palma, don't leave me, please. Please let us... go home, Palma. Let's go home. Let's get out of here. Let's go home. Palma! Palma! My dearest dog! How are you? Come on, turn around! Are we going together? Shall we go? Let's go, Palma! Come on! How is it? Suction when it's too hot. Hot, hot, hot! Thank you, Sergei Pavlovich. - You're welcome. Let's get you dry. - Nina, do you have to do that on the sofa? A dog... You better do that on the floor. Like this. Raspberry tea is the very best remedy. Nina, what about the milk? - You're sweating a lot. Tomorrow you'll be as good as new. - Couldn't you take care of that? Yes. - Drink your tea. Thank you. You know what? Tea is bullshit. Drink the milk. Careful, it's hot. What are you doing? Palma can't take milk. Here you go. Kolya. Put that away. Let them drink it. This will help with anything. - I don't drink alcohol. Who do you think I am? Take a whiff. This is not wine. Dad! What are you doing? Booze! - Calm down, Nina! What kind of liquor? - And what is that? Am I an idiot who gives liquor to a child? I don't know. Then what is it? - Why are you making such a fuss? What is the name of the outgrowth on a birch tree? Chaga mushroom. - There! Yurievich knows it. I'm not setting foot in here again! - Don't go! Sit down. Lunch will be served in a moment. Sit down! It's like kindergarten! Come on! - Yes, I'm listening. Palma, my love. - Now, calm down. Tomorrow? You're my dog now. I love you! Kolya, open up. We have to go. - I won't open the door. Open the door! - No. Kolya, open the door! - I'm not opening the door! I have a flight. I can't miss it. Nobody's going anywhere. Please. Open the door. I just want to talk. Nothing happens without your consent. I promise. He'll take her anyway. If not on my flight, it'll be on the next one. He won't. - He's the owner. She's waited so long for him. Do you want to take this moment away from her? She's my dog, all right? So you don't care? - Yes! I'm not giving it away! She lives with me now, and she will live with me forever! Nobody's going anywhere! If you love her, you have to let her go! Like you let me and Mom let go'? I didn't let you go. I let you down. I failed you, Kolya. And now I'm terribly sorry.., for what I did. I was just thinking about myself. I was dreaming of heaven, of my career. I'm afraid, that your appearance changes everything. But now I'm glad that you changed my life. I want to be the best father in the world. Yeah, your mama's gone. But if you give up Palma.., you won't be alone. I'll always be with you. never leave you alone. If you really love Palma, you can't just think about yourself. Life gives us the most wonderful examples of loyalty and friendship. When I read the amazing story of the faithful dog, I knew that the owner ...would come back for sure. Because a truly Soviet man cannot betray a friend. The owner turned out to be as Igor Polski, who was on an on an extended trip abroad. He came as soon as he could to fetch his beloved Palma. And here's Comrade Lasarev! He'll be taking the dog to Prague ...he'll take the dog to Prague. Let's give him a handshake! - Yes! Good afternoon, Comrade Lasarev. - Good afternoon, comrade. Hello, Kolya. Of course Kolja is happy that the dog finally sees his master again. Tell us about your joy. And what does Comrade Lasarev feel... on this happy day before his first flight out of the country? I can't even comprehend it yet. You're being very modest, Comrade Lasarev! - Wonderful! But now, dear friends, the main event: the return of Igor Polski. - Yes! Let's go, comrades! Goodbye. Thank you. Comrade Polski! Good day! Congratulations on your happy arrival. Good afternoon. We all look forward to your return. Tell me what you're feeling now before meeting with your faithful friend? Alma. Hello. It's me. Alma? What's the matter? Don't you recognize me? Alma? Alma, come to me. Did you look out for her? Yes. - Thank you very much. Here. Comrade Polski. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yes, of course. I don't understand why you left I don't understand why you left the dog. It just happened that way. And in general, everything that happens here, is not my initiative. Couldn't get away for a day? - How do you imagine that? I got a job as a sales representative in Prague. I fly there for work, and what? "Goodbye! I'm flying back!"? Who would have let me go? A lot of time has passed. Then why not later? I explained that to you. All my life I've dreamed I've dreamed of this work. And I'm finally there. I was ashamed. There was this article about it, how splendid Alma is and what a scoundrel her master is. I was going to write an anonymous letter that I wasn't going to get her and leave it to someone more worthy. How can I look people in the eye I can look people in the eye? All right, if you don't want the dog, then leave him to the boy. I can't. Wait. I'm buying the dog! - What? My Moskvitch. It's brand new. - Stop it. Bought it six months ago. - Stop it! It's just a dog! Good. How much? I'll put some money on top. - It's not about the money! I just can't! Lysko told me: "If you don't take the dog, ...then your party card on the table.., and you'll be out of a job, too!" I didn't want a dog at all! He was a birthday present. It all went kind of sideways. Come on, Vyacheslav Yurievich? Yeah, in a minute. Come on! Well, then, it only remains for me ...is to wish you a safe flight. Good luck and all the best. - Thank you. Report to flight readiness. Navigator ready. - Copilot ready. Flight engineer standing by. Your ticket, please. Thank you. The return of the dog. Come. Alma, we have to go. Where's he going? There you go, buddy! Stop! - Palma! Stop filming! Palma! She doesn't want to go to him! Get that kid out of here! Let go of me! Dad! Read the card before engine start. Flight documents? - They're on board. Dad! Let go of me! Dad! Artificial horizon. Checked. Line pairs are in alignment. Oxygen masks? - Ready. Come on, a few more steps. Come on! A little more. Come on! Come on. - Thank you. Quiet. I'll put your bag upstairs. Kolya! Be a man! - Let go of me! Listen to me! Kolya! Calm down! Card read. Obtain permission to start. Vyacheslav Yurievich? Vyacheslav Yurievich! Slawa? Fasten your seat belts, please. Please step aside! Make way for the passenger stairs! So, what's going on? Lyubov Arkadyevna, please don't punish the crew. For what? We're not going today. The flight is cancelled. I see. Anya! - Yes, Lyubov Arkadyevna. Make an announcement to the passengers, that the plane is waiting for takeoff, so as not to create a disturbance. It'll take about 20 minutes. Smile while you do it. Katya! Call Fedya to me! Slava, you know that this is a breach of duty? You'll be arrested and taken away. And you'll lose your pilot's license. Do you understand that? I see. Departure is expected in approximately 20 minutes. Gosha, are you ready to take of the captain to Prague? No, I'm not ready. All right, you don't know the route well. - I know it well. I don't want to. I will not fly. You'll lose your license, too. Shurina here. Solotaryov and his crew here immediately. You have a flight to Prague in 20 minutes. I said urgent! What happened? Lead Lasarev out. Are you deaf, Fedya? Vyacheslav Yurievich? I have nothing against you. - Yes, Fedya, of course. Do you have a certificate for the dog? I beg your pardon? What the hell is going on here? For the animal a certificate is required. What's going on here? What's going on? The dog doesn't have a certificate. - What certificate? How do you... Lyubov Arkadyevna, would you put an end would you put an end to this circus? You can't do it without a certificate. There's something wrong with that dog. Look at the way he's breathing. Maybe rabies. I'm sick of this fuss! Send the plane immediately! Comrade Polski. You can't do it without a certificate. Lyubov Arkadyevna, aren't you afraid you're not afraid I'll fire you? Yes, even very scared. But the dog was not examined. I don't write the laws. I have to stop the takeoff. Dare you! - I will do it. Get the certificate! - The dog will not fly! Run. Now! Where's he going? Why did you let let the dog go? Because it's not my dog. - Not your dog? Then whose is it? Mine's named Alma. And this one is called Palma. Palma? Palma! Kolya! Did you button the hood? Dad! Dad! - Get your hands off me! Get in the cockpit! Oats asked you out? Oats ask you out? - Dad! Palma, jump in! Suck Yes, if he asks you. Our airport is one of the most modern... Excuse me. Wait a minute, wait a minute. - You're supposed to say "cutting-edge." I know. - One more time. Our airport is one one of the most modern airports in the USSR. We offer domestic and international flights. We fly the best... Yikes! What's that? That was the pilot for foreign flights Vyacheslav Yurievich. The Lasarev.., the one you fired? No, he was suspended suspended for a few months. But he wastes no time, as you can see. Let's take up the passage About the airport again. Come on! Let's go! I was startled.
