Wake up my child. Ah kids these days, roaming like horses all night, sleeping like pigs all day. Wake up. Don't you have a meeting with your boss? You will be late. If you are like this, what will you do when I am gone? If this is your attitude, you might not last in your job. Grandma, I told you I don't want to be a teacher. What? What did you say? You should take your life more seriously. Good Morning. Good Morning! -Yes? -Is there something I can help you with? Oh I am the teacher from Gedu, I am supposed to meet the Secretary today. I'll let her know you are here. In our country, we have over a thousand teachers working for us. Yet, I have not seen anyone less motivated than you. Madame, please don't be angry. You are in the 4th year of your 5th year of mandatory service. Do you wish to continue to serve the government? Well, Madame. Over the years I have realized that maybe I am not meant to be a teacher. Enough! I know the likes of you. Do you realize you are not done with your contract? You still have one more year. Madame, this says Lunana. Yes, Lunana. You said you are not happy in Gedu. We just got word that the Lunana school needs a teacher. It looks like a perfect situation for you, no? Go up to Lunana. But isn't Lunana in Gasa? The Lunana school is not only the most remote school in Bhutan but probably in the world. Our government's pursuit of Gross National Happiness demands for us to provide education for every single child be it in the city or the most remote villages. Madame, I don't think I'll be able to do this. Plus, I have altitude problems. Altitude problems? Aren't you Bhutanese? This is not altitude problems, this is attitude problems! Stop making excuses, and go up. Because of the remoteness and cold, the school closes at the onset of winter. Finish your lessons and come back at that time. -Can't be that bad. -What? I said it can't be that bad. I heard that it's very beautiful up there. You mean Lunana? Do you know what Lunana is like? They don't even have electricity. Plus it's eight days hike man. Why do you want to go to Australia that badly? You have such a respectable job. And you want to leave that and go? I want to do things man. and that is? You want to leave your good government job, and go to a foreign country to be a singer? Yup. Isn't it difficult for Bhutanese to get the visa? It's all done. I just have to follow up in three months. And your grandmother? Are you going to leave her alone here? Ladies and Gentlemen! My special friend Ugyen wants to sing a song. You don't have to worry about Grandma. Hey Ugyen! Come up! Let it be. How are you guys doing? Alright. Oh you know my Australia visa Before I go to Lunana I'll give it to you Can you please follow up with the embassy in Delhi. Don't worry about that, I'll take care of it. I'll bring something to eat. Hello Grandmother. Oh it's you Tandin. Hope your parents are well? Yes, we are all well. Have you lost weight? Yes I lost a little I thought I'll try to keep fit. Back in the day, big and heavy men were considered good catches. Nowadays they seem to prefer ones who look like sticks. Ugyen, what did you mean this morning? Ugyen, I am talking to you. Grandma, I told you... I don't want to work for the government. What? What do you mean? Others would be honored to serve the government and here you want to leave your job? You lost your parents as a child. You completed your education, and got a decent job. I hoped this would be a good life for you. You are going to a foreign country, aren't you? I saw your papers. There's only the two of us left. Why would you want to leave home? The ministry wants to send me to Lunana. Do you even know where Lunana is? Do you know how it is? Wherever they send you, you should just go. Anyway, do whatever you want. Tandin, be well. You need a good shoe to go up. Look, this has a thick sole, and it's also waterproof. Good huh? Yes this is waterpoof. Have you ever heard of gortex, this is gortex. Are you sure? Very sure! 200%! You know Brad Pitt and Leonardo? This is what they wear. There's reception till Gasa, I'll call you till then. After that I won't be able to reach you. I know that. Besides you are up there only for a few months. Next year we will go together to that beach... What is it called? Bondi Beach! It comes on Baywatch. Bye. Ok then Grandma, don't worry about me. Tashi. Safe journey. Take this betel nut. I don't eat these disgusting things. It is cold up there, this will help you. Take it. Bye. See you guys soon. Gasa ! Gasa ! We are in Gasa ! Hello. Are you Mr. Ugyen Dorji? Yes. Huh who are you? I am Michen from Lunana. The village headman sent me to receive you. The village headman knows of me? Of course he does, in fact all the villagers are excited about your arrival. Anyway please let me know if I can be of service to you. Let me take your bag. Give me his luggage. We will spend the night here. Tomorrow we start first thing in the morning for Lunana. Let's go inside, I have ordered dinner. Thank you. Your food. Gasa is always like this. The electricity always comes and goes. Very unreliable. You are really an expert with that. Please have a beetlenut. You don't eat? No I don't. This is Zam, Maja and Kasha. And this is my friend Singye. -Good Morning Sir. -Good Morning. He is also from Lunana. Sorry for the delay, the village headman wanted us to do some shopping for your stay in Lunana. Shopping? What did you guys buy? Milk powder, sugar, and toilet necessities. We heard that city people can't take shits without toilet paper. So we were worried for you. For us leaves do it. Will the walk up be hard? It will be easy. It will be a stroll along the river for the first six days. Then there is a little climb. As we reach up there, the walk is so nice. You will wish it never ends. Let's start. -Hey. -Yes? You said the walk will be a stroll by the river. Yes it is. But... we have been climbing up for over 3 hours. It's only a little bit more. It's easy. Ok. What's this? You said it will start to go down. It's been climbing the whole time. It will start to go down over there. You have been saying that the whole time! If we told you the path is always going up you would be discouraged, and find the walk even harder. You guys are just liars! That time you guys said that it would start going down. No matter how hard I push myself It's never going down! Please don't get angry. Here you go. It will help you walk. Yeah. Singye! Singye! -Help the teacher with his bag. -Ok ok. Let me take your bag. It was tiring huh? We spend the night here today. This is Phurba and his wife Yangchen. They run this place as a guesthouse for travellers trekking to Lunana. This is the last stop, and from tomorrow we will have to spend our nights in tents. Please serve the teacher your special rice wine. Yangchen's rice wine is very good. I'll have a cup too. Please have a second. No thank you. You have to have a second cup, it's the tradition. Please have. You must have. -Is the bamboo bowl for the teacher? -Yes. Oh good. Don't you wear shoes? Outside is very cold and rocky. I have always been without shoes, so I find this more comfortable. And I don't have the money to buy shoes. Oh you are up. Did you sleep well last night? Yes I did. Yangchen! The teacher is up. Come, let's serve breakfast. Farewell Phurba. See you when we come back down. Be careful on the walk up. Bye bye. Take care. How come your shoes are so clean? Look at mine, people would think we were walking on different paths. It's because I avoid stepping in the mud. What are you saying? It's mud everywhere ! I got my shoes in Thimphu The shopkeeper guaranteed it would be water and mud proof. She lied. My socks are all wet. I have never worn any other shoes. When I first got these, I was so excited I slept in them. If I wore fancy shoes like yours, I probably wouldn't even know how to walk. Give me your hand. Walk along this. Here... let me put this on your feet. What's that? We always put this on sores and cuts. Don't worry, it will be fine. Your socks are wet, let me dry them for you. Thank you. Like milk in a porcelain cup, the heart is pure. So pure that even if the cup breaks, the milk remains milk. You two can really sing. We are yak herders. We have to be able to sing. Sing with us. I don't sing such songs. Ok then. Like milk in a porcelain cup, the heart is pure. So pure that even if the cup breaks, the milk remains milk. Sir! Sir! -Breakfast is ready. -Ok coming! This bird comes when the spring flowers bloom so when we see her in winter we feel so happy because she is telling us spring is coming. As we cross each pass we hoist the flags of the wind horse oh victorious mother of passes, please accept our offerings -Hey. -Yes? What are you two doing? We have reached the last pass before Lunana. So we are paying our respects. We are getting late. Maybe it's better we keep walking, no? We believe mountain passes are abodes of the protectors. So we must make offerings and pay our respects for the safe journey. So we offer incense, and make different offerings. Victory to the Gods! Sir, here... you should place a stone on this pile. Every traveler who has traveled through this pass places a stone as a symbolic offering for safe passage and to wish for you to return one day. Here offer it. Oh well then. When I was a child, all these mountains would be covered in snow and ice. But now, we never see them white. This is called global warming. What? Global warming. I don't know what you mean by this 'global warming' But I do know that snow and ice are the abode of the mythical snow lion. But with less snow and ice every year, she is losing her home. I worry that soon the snow lion will forever disappear from our world. Like water in a vase, the heart is clear. So clear that infinite beauty is reflected in its depth. Like water in a vase, the heart is clear. So clear that infinite beauty is reflected in its depth. What are those people doing? They have come to receive you. Have we reached Lunana? Oh no, we still have about 2 hours to go but since this is your first time here, the village has come to welcome you. This is our village headman, Asha Gup Jinpa. -Hello. -Hello. On behalf of all the people in Lunana, I want to welcome you to Lunana. Please come. You are our teacher, I have hope that you will give these children the education they need to become more than just yak herders and cordycep gatherers. Bring some tea. Thank you. If you have finished, shall we go? This is our school. Oh this is it? This is the classroom We don't have much but the children are very interested in studying and are excited that you have come. Let's go to your room. This is your room. The winds here can be very cold so we have covered the windows with thick traditional papers. The toilet is outside. The previous teacher left a trunk it has some of his teaching materials. Asha, I'll be honest with you I don't know how I can even teach here Do you know this is the world's most remote school? I don't know how the previous teacher even taught. This is not for me. I don't want to be here. I really want to go back. Enough now! You guys should go away! Let the teacher rest. I said to leave. Go now. Go, go, go. I told them I didn't want to be a teacher. Michen, Singye and the horses need to rest. After a few days, they can take you back. But Asha, our village needs a teacher. It's ok Michen. We should also leave. 'Betel nut will help with the cold', he said. Let's see. Who is it? Coming ! Good morning, Sir. Who are you? I am Pem Zam, I am the class captain. The class what? The class captain. So? What do you want from me? Our class starts at 8:30 a.m. it's now 9:00 a.m. Since you weren't coming, I came to check on you. -Class? Today? -Yes there is. Go back to class, I'll come. Good morning, Sir. -Sit down. -Thank you Sir. Huh... since toda is the first day of class, we will introduce each other, ok? I'll start first. My name is Ugyen Dorji and... Pem Zam, where is the blackboard? The what? Nevermind. My name is Ugyen Dorji and I am the new teacher here. I come from Thimphu. This is my first time in Lunana. Now let's introduce ourselves. You, what's your name? My name is Pema. What do you want to do when you grow up? When I grow up, I want to work for the government. Why? I want to serve our King. Oh that's very good. Pem Zam? What do you want to do when you grow up? When I grow up, I want to become a singer. Okay then, sing us a song. All of us are going to listen to Pem Zam. So what's your name? My name is Sangay Dorji, when I grow up I want to be a teacher like you. Teacher? Why? I want to become a teacher because a teacher touches the future. Touch the future? It's good you want to be a teacher then city teachers like myself don't have to come up here. I have nothing to teach today so take the day off. Go and help your family. Thank you Sir. Hey class captain. What did the previous teacher teach? He taught us English, Maths and Dzongkha. The textbooks are in the trunk in your room. Oh ok. I'll take a look later. Oh that's Saldon. She is singing Yak Lebi Lhadar. Singing the what? Yak Lebi Lhadar. She is one of the best singers in our village. Ok, you should go home now. This is our school's bell You have to ring it at 8:30 in the morning and at 3:00 in the afternoon. Okay, thank you Pem Zam. Go home now. Who is it? Hello. Oh Michen. -Sit. -Ok. Here is some rice, butter and cheese. All the villagers contributed for you. Oh, I was trying to charge my things. But it doesn't seem to work. It's all solar here, It works sometimes, sometimes it doesn't. I was woken up this morning by Pem Zam. The kids were all waiting for me in the classroom. Oh so you had class? Yes I had. Looks like Pem Zam will be waking me up everyday. She is Wangda's daughter. She is quite the smart one. Yes, she is quite smart. Were you trying to make a fire? Yeah, I was going to make myself some hot tea. But I couldn't start a fire. Maybe I'll burn papers to start the fire. Burning paper in Lunana would be like burning money. We start our fires with yak dungs. Yak dungs? Yes yak dungs. Can you show me how to? Of course, I'll be happy to. -Michen. -Yes? What is that up there? What? the round thing? -Yes. -Oh it's for the kids to play with. -For kids to play with?! -Yes. Sir, this is Grandma Tashi. She walked from another mountain range to make a request to you. I heard there was a new teacher here in Lunana. We don't have a school in our village, so I have brought my granddaughter here hoping she could get an education. Hey Wangda! Wangda! How many times do I have to tell you not to drink this much! Can you stay sober for Pem Zam's sake. Oh is this Pem Zam's father? He's always drunk, from sunrise to sunset. A real hopeless case. Useless man. Can you stop being like this. Come Sir, let's go. He never listens. This is my wife Gyem Lham. What is this Michen?! You don't even tell me the teacher is coming by. All you have is this big body, with an empty head! You idiot! Good Morning, Sir. Good Morning Gyem Lham. You know the moment I saw her, I knew I had to marry her. She was so tough and refused all my advances. She only agreed to marry me after I sang her a song. Which song did you sing? Remember me and Singye sang a song by the riverside? Rangsem. Oh yes. Yes that one. The moment I sang that song for her, she totally lost it for me. Come. Ok Gyem Lham. Here... this is how we dry yak dungs. If you use these, you don't need to burn papers. Thank you. I'll show you how to start a fire with these. Come in. So you take them like this, and start lighting them from the side. It will then burn on their own. For us, we want to make sure that you are comfortable and warm here. You all are too respectful, my friends would find it so funny. Well, you are a teacher. A teacher is like anyone else. You can't compare as a teacher you can touch... the future. How did you know I would say that? This morning, the little boy said it. Asha always says that 'every teacher must be treated respectfully because they can touch our futures.' When I was studying to be a teacher no one told us that. Pem Zam! Yes teacher? What are you carrying? I collected incense for my grandmother. Who is there at your home? Father and mother have separated, father is usually drunk and gambling, mother is away with the yaks. So I live with my grandmother right now. Pem Zam ! Lets go ! Teacher, I need to go. Ok Pem Zam. Let's begin the day with the national anthem, ok? Ok teacher. Class captain. Stand at ease! Attention! National anthem! 1, 2, 3 In the thunder dragon kingdom, adorned with sandalwood, the protector who guards, the teachings of the dual system... Stand at ease! Ok let's go to the classroom now. Attention! Huh it's ok... go inside. Since you don't have note books I brought you paper and pencils. So class captain, please distribute these. Take them. Schools usually have something called a blackboard. Since we don't have one, I will write on the wall. Everyone, please copy down what I am writing. Ok. 1 plus 1 equals to? Yes 2. 2 plus 2 equals to? 3 plus 3 equals to? Yes, write it down. 4 plus 4 equals to? Oh! Singye. Teacher is teaching. So good! Children must be so happy. Yea they must be. Excuse me. Yes? Is there a way to go up? Yes there is. Which way is it? You just follow this path up. -This way up? -Yes that way. I am sorry. You were singing here yesterday right? I was up there... collecting yak dungs. I am the new... The new school teacher, I know. You must be Saldon. Pem Zam told me. Do you always sing from here? Why do you do that? Just like that... offering of songs. Hey! Wait! What do you mean by offering? I don't understand. It's a song I offer to all beings, to all the people, to the animals, the gods, to all the spirits in our valley. What do you mean? When the black-necked cranes sing, they sing not worrying who hears or what others think. They sing to offer. I want to sing like that. Oh can you teach me the song? You want to learn Yak Lebi Lhadar? Yes. Ok... one day then. You should pick up the dried ones. The dried yak dungs. Oh yes... the dried ones. Come in Sir. Good evening Asha. Hello Sir. Please sit. This is my daughter Biddha. She looks after everything in the house. Asha where is your wife? My wife died. She died when Biddha was ten. She was expecting, both her and my unborn son passed away. This photo was taken in Gasa. Father, dinner is ready. Please serve our teacher in the wooden bowl. Asha, you don't have to do that. I can eat in anything. No, you must eat in the wooden bowl. Sir, are you able to eat? What is this? It's shoes. Shoes? This Singye is always saying disgusting things! Asha I haven't had this kind of feast since New Year. When I was little, My grandmother would always let me eat in her wooden bowl. Food is always better in wooden bowls. Even right now eating in your bowl, The food tastes just as it did back then. I miss my Grandma right now. Good afternoon teacher. Good afternoon Asha. Oh Michen has come too. What are you up to? I am preparing for tomorrow's lessons. Actually, we came to inform you, we are ready to go back to Gasa. We can start whenever you wish. Well Asha, I think I'll stay back. It would be a pity to leave the kids now. Plus I would get into trouble with the ministry if I didn't finish my term. This is so good! Sir, this is the best decision for everyone. Don't worry, we are here to help you with anything you need. Just let us know. Actually, I do need help with something. So...this is a blackboard. Ok teacher. We will write on it with this okay? Ok. Do you all know what this is? It looks like dog poop. Good. Pem Zam. -Good afternoon Asha. -Oh hello Sir. Saldon just came over with fresh cheese and now you visit, how auspicious. Please offer to the teacher. I have known Saldon's mother for a long time, She is like my sister. When she was young, she went to collect wood, she had an accident and broke her leg. The entire village came to help her. I used to cry all the time Asha would sing to soothe my crying. Oh Asha you are also a singer? Oh I don't have the voice, but for her sake I had to sing. Asha, I'll go now. My yaks should be coming home now. Goodbye Sir. Bye Saldon. Asha, I came to see you because I wanted to know if anyone is going to Gasa. Oh what happened? I wanted to send a letter to my friend in Thimphu, to ask him to send some supplies for the school. Don't worry, I'll send someone over to you. Great. Thank you Asha. You have benefited the children so much. All the villagers are also very happy. I am happy to be here. I guess there is a karmic connection. Yes, maybe I was a yak herder in my previous life. No, you were more than just a yak herder. Maybe you were a yak in your previous life. A yak?! Yaks are so beneficial to us. Oh Saldon. Why is there a yak in the classroom? This is Norbu. He is our oldest yak. I brought him for you. For me? What am I to do with a yak? You are always climbing up the mountain to pick up dungs. So he is for you. Since he gives us his precious dungs his name is Norbu (wish-fullfilling jewel) I don't think we can keep him in the classroom. Can I tie him outside? No you can't. It's too cold outside. Yaks can feel cold? Of course they can. Please keep him inside. You can feed him according to how much dung you need. Here, the lyrics for Yak Lebi Lhadar. Hey wait! Can you teach me the song? It's a very difficult song. Singing is all the same. No it isn't. I sing... Nursery rhymes for children? Yes nursery rhymes for the children. When you start the song, you have to go higher. The bond between a yak and his herder is so sacred. It's as close as family. When they are alive, he yaks benefit us so much. Whenever the village needed meat, they would gather all the yaks, they would throw a lasso in the air, whichever yak the lasso landed on, that yak would be slaughtered. It was the most heartbreaking moment for the village. Our village had a herder, who had gone to Tibet for trade, and because of their shared karma, the lasso landed on his favorite yak. The yak had to be slaughtered. This song was composed by that herder. Here he says, 'I survive because of my yak,' Then he says the yaks value the high mountain grass and the spring waters,' But actually by saying this, he is praising the purity of one's heart. The pure unpolluted lands, where snow stays throughout the year is actually a reflection of our hearts. At the end of the song, the yak sings back to the herder he says 'Our bond will never be broken,' The yaks might graze all over the mountains, but every evening they always return home. Just like that, this yak also says 'Be it this life or the next, I will return home just as I do every evening' Anyway you should practice ok? Here Norbu, drink water. You have to keep your nails clean ok? You wanted to serve our King, right? You need clean your nails for that. Teacher, we have run out of papers. Oh so fast? Yes, it's all finished. Ok, I'll try and find more. Asha said, you will be gone after the winter. Aren't you happy with us? It's not that Pem Zam. Why don't you want to be with us? I have to go... Good morning Norbu. Everyone wish Norbu good morning. Good morning Norbu! So we have finished all our papers right? Yes teacher. I got you all new papers. Two for every student. This is traditional paper. Yes it is, Pem Zam. I found it in the trunks. -But... -Paper is paper, Pem Zam. Today we will learn English ok? Ok teacher. Everyone copy down what I am writing. A for apple. Who knows this? Namgay? Apple is a fruit. Good! B for ball. Who knows what a ball is? Kencho? Ball is what we play with. Good! C for car. Pema, what's a car? I don't know. -You don't know what a car is? -No, I don't. None of you know what a car is? We don't know. You all never seen one? No, we haven't. Okay, let me change it then. C for Cow. Do you know what a cow is, Pema? Cow gives us milk. Yes! -Good afternoon Asha. -Good afternoon Sir. Please sit. I heard you were looking for me. Yes, horses have arrived from Gasa. There are some items for you. -Is this it? -Yes, that is it. Let me open it for you. Oh, my friend Tandin has sent all these for the school. The children will be very happy. There is also another item. What's this? This is my guitar! Guitar? What are you going to do with a guitar in Lunana? I wanted to sing for the children. There's also a letter. Oh, I wonder what it's about. I have been wanting to go somewhere for a long time. Looks like I can finally go. Oh, that's great news. Where is this place? Far away... across the oceans. It's already autumn, These fields have to harvested as winter comes. We must all prepare for winter, even you must prepare. My friend sent all these from Thimphu. Wow! There's a new ball! Oh look Norbu is also here. Yes, he is. Teacher, what is this? Okay everyone, look at me. This is a toothbrush and a toothpaste. Take it like this. Yes, just the toothpaste. Now open it. Put it on the brush like this. Soak the brush in water . Now go like this. On the top. Farmer Dorji had a house, E-I-E-I-O In his house, he had a yak, E-I-E-I-O Norbu was the yak's name, E-I-E-I-O Norbu huff huff, huff huff, Norbu huff huff... Farmer Dorji had a house, E-I-E-I-O You sound more like a highlander by the day. Not quite, I still have to practice. No you are good already. Hello Sir. Hello. Where are you coming from? I was just on the hill, learning Yak Lebi Lhadar from Saldon. I think you should leave your job and sing songs from the hilltop. Do you guys want to know how Norbu came here, Yes, Sir. Once upon a time, Norbu had a friend. A buffalo... They heard that in Lunana you get the best salt. They wanted to come here and taste it. They heard Lunana was too cold. So one day, the buffalo decided to give all his fur to the yak. But once he got here, Norbu just loved it. He loved the salt, he loved the grass, and he decided to stay here. That is why the buffalo is always seen looking up. Looking up and waiting or his friend, Norbu, to come back down with the salt. Like milk in a porcelain cup, the heart is pure. So pure that even if the cup breaks, the milk remains milk. Like water in a vase, the heart is clear. So clear that infinite beauty is reflected in its depth. Like bamboo dancing in the wind, the heart is humble. So humble that it bends to the wind, yet it never breaks. For such a pure, clear and humble heart happiness follows like a shadow. happiness follows like a shadow. Hello Sir. Oh hello Asha. You have done so much work here. These are all the children's works. The mountain passes are starting to cover with snow. Every day it's snowing more and more. Soon our village will be covered in snow. Winter has arrived. Even our yaks will move to the lowlands. It is also time for you to leave. But... I haven't completed my lessons. If you don't leave now, the paths will be covered in snow, and you will be stranded till spring. Nobody wants to see you leave. But there is no choice. Please come back next year. Come back for the children. But Asha, I am leaving Bhutan. For how long? Maybe forever. I hear some people claim that we are the happiest country in the world. Yet you... someone who is educated, someone who can serve the country, someone who is the future of our country, wishes to seek happiness elsewhere? I will tell Michen and Singye to prepare the horses. You should leave the day after tomorrow. Asha said you are leaving the day after tomorrow. Yes. You won't return next spring? It appears so. You don't want to be a teacher here? I am sure there will be a better teacher coming. Don't say that. You will never know if you are a good teacher or not. Only the students like Pem Zam, Kencho and Pema would be able to say that. According to them, they were the happiest with you. All of them are so sad that you are leaving. I will miss your voice around the school. Will you ... ever come to Thimphu? No I won't. This is home for me. My mother is here. She's getting old now, and the cold hurts her feet. I want to stay here. I'll be waiting here for you to perfect Yak Lebi Lhadar. Sing like the black-necked cranes. Come Norbu. Sir? Singye and I are ready. Ok, I am coming. I am sure spring will bring a new teacher. Yes, but no one like you. Asha, you did not have to come this far. We received you many moons ago, now we have to bid you farewell. Please sit. It's ok, I'll stand. Offer the teacher rice wine. I offer this wine to the protectors of the highlands, please protect our teacher Ugyen, just as you protect us. For he is also a son of Lunana, who has always been karmically connected with our snowy peaks. Teacher, this letter is from all us students. Thank you, Pem Zam. The journey is long, you should get started. Goodbye. Ugyen! Looks like we will not meet again. Thank you for everything, for bringing Norbu to me, for Yak Lebi Lhadar. Thank you very much. We will always be here. Look up there. Oh Asha can sing Yak Lebi Lhadar? We told you before, all us yak herders can sing. Besides, this is his own song. Yak Lebi Lhadar is Asha's song? Yes it is. Asha used to be considered as one of the best singers in our village. He first sang this song when he was young. But... he suddenly stopped singing when his wife died. He would always say that he would only sing again when his yak returned home. Thank you teacher for teaching us, you have been our favorite teacher, you showed us the importance of having good hearts, we will never forget how you took off the papers from your own window to make sure we were able to study. For the sake of us students, and for Norbu the yak, please come back to us. Thank you very much. May I ask what you are doing? Making offerings for our safe passage. Oh are you? And making aspirations to be able to return one day. Ok then, let's do it together. Hey Ugyen ! What you doing mate? I am paying you to sing !
