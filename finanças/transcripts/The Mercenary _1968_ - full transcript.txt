THE MERCENARY Paco Roman became a clown. Better a clown living than a dead hero. Me, Sergei Kowalski Polish emigrant, I have always said. Early in our history, Paco was a simple peon. But a peon like no other. It's Sunday. It is not expected to have more to eat? Look, amigos. Today was meat. He's right. We are all housed in the same boat. It's true. Swallow it and you can endure anything. People no longer speak that of Francisco Madera. - Who is it? - A less than nothing. It seems that everyone is equal home. So I brought you our lunch. Eat, prompted. So what? You're not hungry? Come on, taste it to me. It's good, eh? He ate it. He ate it! Cheers! Stealing the rich to give to the poor, it does not please the rich. I ate well so I do not care. You'll find this bitter lesson. As far as what did you eat? Go ahead. Charge! - Pepote! - Come. Not far away is the bar of Curly. It is rich, powerful. Is the boss. Thirty ... and that's it. I lie. Four jacks. Two ladies. With those two ... that makes four. - Are you kidding? - In case ... There is this. Thank you. September! Sorry, man. Place your bets, try your luck. Come on, we relaunch the dice. September! The dice. The result? Sept. Another seven, right? Do you like milk? Not really, no. - A glass of milk. - It works. Hold. I must drink? - Thank you. - The dice. Here's to you. Is better. When they emerge, do you use it more. Pay those who have been cheated. What do you drink? It's on the house. The Polack! If you seek me, you might stay there. - You'll burn your fingers. - I have gloves. I do not see them! I have removed because I shoot better without. We can no longer drink a drink in peace. Little scamp. Hello, Curly. Talk about a surprise! I had not seen you. - He is the Polack? - It will help us. The revolution will break out Mexico. We have silver mines Sierra in Palo. Armed gangs attack any convoy. We have accumulated seven tons of money. It should convey the Sierra Palo ... - In Mexico City? - No. My brother, Alberto Garcia, wants to send money United States. He is willing to pay $ 400 plus $ 100 per week for someone like you, Mr. Kowalski. Why you do not ask the army? My brother thinks that with you, money is sure to happen United States. - 1000. - How? $ 1 000 deposit, more than 200 per week, more travel and food. - That's your money. - The revolution has begun. This is serious. It will be a risky journey. Enforcement is delayed. Looks like the Poles hooked a big fish. Now I am interested in Mexicans. In fact, you're nervous, you could miss your shot. As earlier. He'll pay. I so promise, Curly. Are you married? I am divorced. - Children? - No. All right. Plays. Fire! Resting. Go open the door. Good evening, darling. Between. Between amigo. The girls are pretty. You are American? Want a girl or a drink? I was told that you sold weapons. If I'm not mistaken. Get out all. This man comes to talk business with Pepote. This way. I have Colt, of Winchester, the Mauser. Or a nice gun. - The machine gun. - It's funny. Rather, the Americans selling weapons. The new model by Hawkins. 300 strokes per minute. I bought it for a good cause. But when the heart gets involved ... I sell everything cheap. All. I am the to 2,000 pesos only. 1000. 1 800. 1000. 1500? - 1000 or nothing. - Go to 1000. Good morning. - Hello. - Hello, Se?or . Which of you order? Me. I am Elias Garcia. This is one of my brothers. Did you hear? The other did not use to us. I have no time to lose. What mission have you given to the Polack? What a Polack? I do not understand ... Don Elias is shy. Help him, Sebastian. This valley is infested with vultures. They would soon devouring a corpse. Where did the Polack and why? Mine of Palo Alto. My brother recruited him to convey money. You will not need money ... where you go. Hello, gringo. Hands in the air. Approach. Gently. Keep your hands in the air. Go! What are you looking here? One of the brothers Garcia. Alfonso. He was lucky. This is his cousin who hanged himself there. It recognizes the least. I had to ferry the money, but given the situation, I assume that money eventually into your hands. What do you know about money? I had to bring it through the border. You know what makes this type finally hanged? Not? I'll show you. Look. Here the mine where the money and there, the gentleman detonated dynamite. An entire mountain separates us money now. I did hang and I dig. - How many are you? - Twelve. Paco Roman and his twelve apostles. You should stir. Working 24 hours 24, you will ... ten years, to pretty much. Where are you going? I go out. My task is finished. It's a strange story which begins with a treasure which disappears when they found it. You speak well. As a priest. Or a high-flying swindler. I know the crooks, they do not talk like you. Who are you? You're fast. Who are you? Sergei Polish. If they keep me out, I'll kill you. It will not help. They do not care you kill me or not. - You know count to ten? - Yes. I know also add, subtract and divide. Fine. Starts counting. I want to just ten, they drop their guns. One, two, three ... The guys ... Good going ... What have we here? Decidedly, you have no chance. Why? What does it say? It is addressed to Garcia. A whole troop of soldiers is underway. Guess who's headed? A Garcia. Colonel Alfonso Garcia. It's a trap. A machine gun. You, there! Come! Come and help me to assemble it! I do not work for nothing. You are willing to pay? - How? - 200. Sort of ... Well, here it is, your money. Profiteer! I take over. Rafael! Provides ammunition. It will do nothing against their guns. How does it work? You, you know how to use it! Draw is not assembled. 200 more. All right. Here, 200! We have them. First line, load! We need to find dynamite. There must have. Will see in the mine. Okay. Roberto. - Put it here. - What for? They believe it has more ammunition. Go! They no longer fire. Attack. Hurry up and up. What for? Confront the army, but to our advantage. - It goes where? - Right on the guns. Jumps. Cheers, gringo! You're a military genius. The only one helping me. I almost get you down! You would not have helped me against these bastards. You would have killed anyone. I had my gun in your back. Yes. I was wondering ... Why gringo does not kill me? I thought ... I thought ... It is not on their side? I'm on one side: Mine. You have praised my services. What's more ... I pity you. I have no need for me to complain. Do not repeat it. One day you'll lose your head. That annoy me have to complain too when you're dead. You talk as fast you pull. Cheers, guys! Here's to you, gringo. Long live the revolution! What it is? To kill the leaders to strip. There is not that much, right? The speech this is not my forte. I saw my father die in these mines. My brother also. But not me. I'll die not in there. I will make the revolution. I'm doing well, right? No. I was given this for you. You have learned the rules? When one follows the rules, you lose. You travel light. Where is the money? I paid dearly for that information. Do not you, Curly? You're wasting your time. Forget the money. You're a hard, Polack. But I know how soften people, even people like you. You'll see. Let's go. Sebastian! We've been looking for breakfast. Why you left so early? I'm an early riser. I have not forgotten the money. I need you alive. But not him. It makes what? I would take him his boots ... and everything else. Good idea. Go ahead! Enough is enough. Let him enough to go home. Naked, it must be hideous. Queue. He told you to spin. We'll Meet Again and I will kill you ... Mexican. Fits well. I want the machine gun. - Anything else? - You are a clever, you. We could team up. Teach me to make the revolution. Comprehensive program. You will not be rich enough. Half. Half of our treasure. It's pretty, right? Forget the treasure and listen to me. It does not exist. Give me the money, the true, I can see and touch. That's all that interests me. Say 200 per day. Plus costs. Prepaid. Give everything you have. With the help of gringo, the country's banks are ours. Not true, gringo This is a good investment. Rafael! I have nothing more to invest. I lost everything. You see, if you ask nicely, we can have everything. Your learning began. First, we never turn back to a type that has robbed. Deuzio, leave here before the army arrives. Many will. Started! You too, Rafael. We are an army. 1. CAVALRY One, two, one, two ... Section ... Stop! Left ... left! 2. Infiltrate the POST COMMAND 3. BUGLE 4. GUN 5. BANK Come out, you are free! Saut? the locks. These boots are too tight. There's not much. 3000 or 4000 in notes, over 2,000 gold. I owe you ... 2800 for both last week, right? Exact. No tickets. Happy to be free? Leave the police to find the bandits I'm not jumping for joy. - Your name? - Colomba. - We are not bandits. - Of course. You are revolutionaries, I know music. My father was one. He eventually hanged. But he would never have recruited a stranger. This is not a gringo like the others. This is my employee. He told me what to do. The money is enough for me. This is to you, General. Say your speech and draw us. The food and supplies held by the State belong to the people, that is to say to you! Those who want help the revolution closer! Long live the revolution! The success is mixed. I want to help. Nothing keeps me here. Take all uniforms. I have an idea. Not stay planted there. Do what he says. Colomba, if you want to follow us, help us. You are military elite of this country. The rebels are exhausted. We will overcome and eliminating their leaders. You smile? An article in the newspaper? What has he? - The rebels. - Where? Here. One movement and you become a victim of the revolution. Are you ready? I am ready, Paco. You can reach your regiment. It's 30 km walk. It is not long for a soldier of the republic. The bag of the barracks we reported 26,000 pesos over 10,000 of the train attack. How much is that? 5600 dollars. 4 weeks of pay. And that? No, repackages it. Go. So the hero? A revolutionary not ashamed of his actions. A thief like you, though. I am not a thief. I liberated this city. This is the salary of my army. This is theft. Nothing else. You are going away, soldiers return, they will take revenge, and these people will be alone again. What has he? It is you, the liberator. They want to cheer you. - Money. - I'm on it. Welcome to our city. - Paco Roman Vive! - Fear not, thief. They take you to Simon Bolivar. Show yourself. It is rich, tonight! Rich and happy! Rich and happy! What will happen tomorrow? What? You have my word. It is. There remains. A drink. You drank all night. You too think too much? You'll see. It is wrong to think too much. Everything depends on what you think. You think like me? I am sure General. Let's go see it together. Who is it? The army is coming this way. A whole regiment. We'll see tomorrow. By the way ... It is that this Simon Bolivar? And what does that mean, make a revolution? Make a revolution? At the head, there are leaders, those who work other. The rich. Below, there are the poor. The revolution aims at unity. Gather the top and bottom. Malin, the Bolivar. They are brought together and it is the revolution? It's impossible. As you see, rich and poor are well separated. I see. I'm with the poor. It should be ready in 10 minutes. - The machine gun is next. - No. What, no? No, that's all. I must stay here. You're still drunk. You're going to sober up quickly when he saw the guns. That's why I stay. I have to protect these people. These pigs Republicans not scare me. I will fight with one hand. Of course, general you're a big boy. It is found in Sonora. If you drop these pigs Republicans back and deep pockets. Why? Next time, my rates have increased. Poor Paco . You think you're Bolivar. You became an idealist. The shortest path to the cemetery. And for lunch? 30 eggs, 2 sliced ?? ham, 4 pounds of cheese 40 loaves of bread at a minimum, and 30 bottles of beer. Especially beer. All ... this is for you? Do not ask a man that pays well. Of course, everything you want. I will not ask anything. You are right. Paco is on its way. Looking for me, that's for sure. Hello, Se?or. Sleep well? Yes, thank you. You have everything ready? Yes, se?or . Everything is ready. Hams, the loaves of bread, 30 bottles of beer, as expected, generally. Captain. Yes ... Captain. Get out of there. Shall we? Get out of there, it will cool. There were too many. Everything went wrong. Curly was with them. The guy we did not kill. I know what you're thinking, the Polack. I offer you twice. I do not do credit. Ira. You're an honest man. Listen, Paco, I can make you as famous that Pancho Villa or Zapata. I can make you all rich, but I want to be left carte blanche. What do you mean? Do not worry, I've thought of everything. I we have prepared a small contract. "First, "I will be the sole judge military decisions. "Deuzio, "During the contract period, "Not exceeding 8 weeks, "Whatever the circumstances, "I hereby Sergei Kowalski "Will be housed in a tent or shelter "And receive food and tobacco according to my whim. "Tercio, "My hand will be charged before the other. "My salary "Climbs to 200% its starting value. "This money will come "Of property confiscated during our revolutionary acts." Sign. If you lower your trousers before the Poles, why not add women to the list? Paco Roman will provide you also women. The revolution deserves that! Choose the ones you want. Those whores or those who love the fine gentlemen. Even the most expensive! Even a soldier in petticoats like me. You do not refuse him anything. He need only ask. Go to bed, Colomba. - Enough. - In bed? Come gringo. Go ahead alone. The Polack did not want you. I said nothing. Colomba, listen to me. You do not want him? Of course I do. Why not? He, at least, this is a hombre! Are you happy? Not quite. Try like that. With his best friend. And his partner. Gringo! Where is he? It stinks, right? No. It's good for the skin. - It's true, you look great. - What did you, idiot? Go ahead. Show us as good as the Mexicans. Go! Or I'll blow your brains out. Sorry, gringo. You know how women are. I want it. You exaggerate, Paco. But if you want a fight, I'll show you how a jealous idiot is thrashing. Standing. - It's unfair! - Wait a minute. Take that in the face! He's crazy! You won, Paco. Arm. Plays. Fire! Halt. What? Why do we stop? I'm hot. Santa Rosita is a big city. There will be a garrison. It's risky. I know, but it's worth it. This Thursday, Rosita is holy festival. The bearded lady. There will be a procession and you know how we are believers. Really? Now! At first of these gentlemen. I have four for the price of one. Who is it? Mayor with his family. Let them hang. No, wait. She will cook and he shall wash our pants. Outside. General Paco Roman! I demand justice. Let me back my land. - I want his head. - What has he done? Ask her. It is the notary. What have you done? I did not do anything, listen. That's the truth: For three months, he asked me to share my house and my wife against his wife and his wretched farm because it is the revolution! All right. Kill him. Not him, the other. One who demands justice. No, General. It is rich, I'm poor! Thank you, General. You are the hope of Mexico. My brother! Your brother? I do not know you. I worked in the mines with you, my friend! My friend! I worked in the mines. It's me, Pepote! Pepote! I knew a Pepote. It was a revolutionary. It was like my brother. I sent it to buy guns. It was long ago. I do not even know you. Remember, he was given money. When he failed to return, it was believed dead. Let me explain. I'm still alive. There, I recognize you. You recognize him? Thank you, my friend. You have betrayed us. You have spent our money. You should not have. Not really. Do not waste a bullet. Take a knife. No, I saved your life! I beg you, I did not want to hurt. This is because of women. It's true. You saved my life. I will not kill you. But you will not go over to a brothel. I swear. I swear I will not do it again! I have to be sure. He should thank me to spare. We can not rely to anyone. Paco wants to see you. He wants to see that too. You are leaving us? It not abandon his friends to their cause. Nobody ever left Paco with deep pockets. Your money stays here to serve the revolution. You're a pig. Maybe, I do not know. You see that? This is Mexico. I did not know it was so great. It's beautiful. I want to work for Mexico. I will take what is ours. I want justice. You will be judged. Colomba. "For eating when we were starving "Drunk and when we were thirsty, "For staying dry "When we walked in the rain and so on, "We condemn you ..." At death, I presume? I do not know ... yet. It depends my digestion. We will have our wedding dinner. Your fate will depend Colomba. Do not be too optimistic. I will marry him. I am a General and a revolutionary. I do not need a priest, or paperwork. Take him. Outside. What a party! Your sword ... Removes it. It hurts me. Fire! What is it? Firecrackers. They celebrate our marriage. Too bad ... - We must liberate the Poles. - Forget it. Paco, they attack! All right, I'll release it. They destroy everything. The Polack they will raze the city! These bastards are everywhere. Help me. They even have a plane. I can hit him with a gun? It's possible, yes. But that's your problem. We no longer team. It may be wrong. I will make your money with 10 000. Too late! No, come back! Stop him! Farewell, Paco! Perfect, they are our thank you. Bravo for once the plane. I'll pick my two rascals. You had promised me. Forward! If it is low enough ... Paco! Colomba!

Both of them. I let you do as you intended. I could have caught. God knows where they are. I want them both alive! Double the reward and patrols. As you wish. Paco managed to get away. It went from hero to clown in six months. Hello, Curly. As we find ourselves. One last time. If you want to kill him, give him a chance. He can defend himself. A ball each. Going back to back. At the third sounding, you can take. Go. Have you seen? Subject property, eh? Not bad. I knew you'd end up. I want ... Take your filthy paws, Paco. Go, ahead. We're going where? Mexico.

It will be before them! MEXICAN BORDER The Poles, I understand. But Paco? Are you married? We were, but a Mexican woman can not be fooled twice. And if it was a trap?
