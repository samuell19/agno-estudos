Didn't you hear Me honking? Hey! I was about to level out. Do you think i care About your video game And what level you're on? Jackson, you know i need Your help with the bags When i go to the store. Did you not hear me Honking the horn? And how many times i have Had to ask you not to turn That stereo up so loud? Mrs. Johnson's gonna be All over me if you woke up Her new baby again. Whatever. Whatever? That's your response, "whatever." Don't you care about Anything anymore? Why is her baby sleeping In the middle of the day anyway? It's a small baby, They take naps. Now, come on, i need Your help with these groceries. Hey, no cookies Until after dinner. Jackson, i said no cookies. What happened To your face? Nothing. I'm fine. Come on. Come on, sit down. Was it that Tommy matthews again? I don't want To talk about it. I'm gonna talk To his mother. No! That will just Make it worse. Was this about your dad? I don't want to talk about it! I want to move away from here. Jackson! We need to. Huh, we need To talk about it. So, do you have Any homework tonight? No. I cannot believe that They don't give homework In high school anymore. What's wrong with Your dinner jackson? You're not even eating. Fish sticks again? Yes, fish sticks again. They were on sale, I stocked up. You know that money Is very tight right now. Besides they're Not terrible If you put Enough ketchup on them. I wonder who could That be at this hour? Good evening, ms. Connors. I need to speak With you about jackson. Please, come on in. I hope i'm not Interrupting anything As the number That we have on file for you Has been disconnected. Things have been a little Tight around here lately, But i do have a cell phone If you ever needed To get in touch with me. Mr. Foster, Please come on in. Have a seat. I haven't seen you In school lately, young man. He's been cutting classes? More than class, school. Let's see, uh-- In the last two months, Jackson has missed 30 days of school. But it's gotten worse. In the last two weeks He's not been there A single day. You've been cutting school? Jackson, would you Come over here please? I'd like to talk with you. Yeah, and so what? I hate school. You hate school? Well, guess what, I hate my job at the bank But i get up And i go down there Everyday like it or not. I don't need this. Jackson, get back here! I swear i don't know What i'm gonna do with that boy. Ms. Connors, i know The recent loss of your husband Has been very difficult For both of you. Jackson and steve Were very close. They did everything together But it's just that i don't Even recognize my own son. I can't imagine what you Both are going through. I have tried to cut jackson As much slack as i can, But, ms. Connors, i can't beat Around the bush anymore, I've decided to hold Jackson back a year. He's going to have To repeat the 10th grade. I think a fresh start would Be very helpful at this point. No, please don't. It's gonna kill him. I know he'll come around. It's just--he just needs A little bit more time. I really don't Have a choice. I mean with the excuse time That he missed following Your husband's accident And the recent time-- He's just fallen Too far behind, I'm sorry, But it's out of my hands. Where do you think You're going? Out. Jackson, would you Please sit down? Your mother and i Would like to talk to you. You can't tell me what to do, You're not my father And we're not at school. Jackson! Jackson, get back here. I'm so sorry. But you see what i mean? I don't even know what I'm gonna do with him. I know jackson. He's a good kid. He's just having trouble Coping with the loss. But going back a grade? All of his friends they're Gonna be ahead of him. Can't he go To summer school? With all the time That he's been absent, He doesn't qualify For summer school. He's just missed Too much instruction. So he'll start over? He'll be a full year behind? Not an entire year. We're a year-round school. I have a new track Starting soon. He'll be able to start then, In a little over two months. I think it will give jackson Time to adjust, to regroup. Don't look at it As a punishment. Jackson will get a chance To catch his breath. Believe me, It's what's best. What should i have him do Between now and then? I mean isn't there anything He can do studying, anything? I think the best thing For both of you right now Is take a break. I mean, could you Possibly go on a vacation Maybe get out of town Or something? You both could use it. Vacation? Yeah, vacation. I mean, even if We could afford it, I could never get that Kind of time off of work. I mean, i'm lucky that I even got my job back After steve died. Well, maybe jackson Can go stay with relatives. I really think he needs to get Away from here for a while. A grandparent perhaps. Both of steve's Parents are gone. And well, my relationship With my own father, uh, The last several years, it's-- It's been completely Non-existent, so-- I see. Well-- I really should be going. Thanks for taking the time To come all the way out here. If i ever can be of help To you, please give me a call. Thank you. Ms. Connors, I maybe out of place here But do you have someone That you can talk to? A counselor, a pastor From your church maybe? I-i've had a grief Counselor but, um, We don't really go To church, so-- Hmm. I'd like to give you The number to my pastor From my church. His name is robert haywood. He was very helpful to me When my father died last year. A pastor? Pastor robert, he's a-- He's a good listener. Keep it, in case you need Somebody to talk to. Thank you. I'll let myself out. Hey, jackson. Hey. We haven't seen you At school for a while. Yeah, i've been busy With some other things. Julie winters said that you Were getting held back a year? Wow, word travels fast.

By telling him you ain't Gonna do something, Well that's not Something i'd recommend. Listen, the last few months Have been a blur. The loss of your dad Has been hard on both of us. And i really think that Right now we've both just-- We need a little time. It's for the best. I can't believe Your sending me away, mom. Jackson, i'm not Sending you away. You're gonna go stay With grandpa for two months Just until school Starts again. He lives in a ranch. He's got dogs and horses. Tons of wide open space. I think it's gonna be Really good for you. But mom. But mom, nothing. I need you to do this jackson. The loss of your dad it's-- It's been hard on you. And i really think It's important that you have A male role model In your life right now. I just can't handle you. I'll be better, i promise. It's not about Being better. It's about us Both starting to heal, And, frankly, i need A little break myself. But, mom, i don't Even know this person. Jackson, this is Your grandfather. My father, The man who raised me. Sound's like that dad. He's here a little bit early. Huh, no surprise. Listen, finish your breakfast And then go on, get packed. Hi, dad. Come on in. Let me get a good look At you young lady. I tell you, If you ain't The spitting image Of your mother. Thanks, dad. Mom's a lot prettier than me. Come here. Hmm, what do we got here? You've got a little bun Roasting in the oven. Daddy, you knew I was pregnant. Come on. Come on, dad. Come on in and have a seat. Jackson just Finished up his breakfast And he's doing A little bit of packing. Just finished his breakfast-- It's after 9. Yes, dad. He's only a kid. A kid? When i was his age, I've already worked four hours Before 9 in the morning. I know, i know and you walked To school both ways, Up hill in the snow. Darn right, we did. I'm just telling you, If the boy is staying with me, He ain't gonna be Having breakfast At no 9 in the morning. Dad, i'm grateful that your Taking jackson for a few weeks But times have changed.

The last few months Have been really rough on him. How about you wake him up At 6 in the morning? Hey, honey. Come on. Come in and say hi To your grandpa. I know it's been a long time Since the two of you Have seen each other. How are you doing? What happened To your face, boy? Looks like you got The worst end of something. Some of the boys at school Have been harassing him, But i'm gonna talk To their mothers. Why, what for? He's a boy, That's what boys do. He needs to fight His own battles. How old are you, boy? 16. Well, get your things Ready to go. We've got a long drive Ahead of us. Dad, you just got here. Come on relax A little, have a seat. It's gonna take jackson A few more minutes To get packed up And that will give You and i A few minutes to talk. Go on, honey, Finished getting packed. Mom, can i talk to you In my room? Sure. Just give me a minute With grandpa, okay? And i'll be there in a few Seconds to help you out. If he's getting ready, probably Wants you to help him pack. A 16-year-old boy wants His momma to help him pack. No wonder He's getting beat up. Dad, i need you to go easy On jackson, all right? He's not happy about this. He's not excited about it, Not one little bit. I'm gonna go Help jackson pack. I'll be back In just a minute, okay? See, grandpa's not that bad. And i should know, i've lived With him for 17 years.

But i promise you You're gonna have a good time. He's my dad. And i want you To get to know him. So why we've never Met him before? Why have we never Gone to see him? Well, that's complicated. That's--that's because Of your father. Dad? Dad, never wanted you To see him? Like i said, It's complicated. It goes way back and its-- It's something I truly regret. Hey, if i have To live with him, Then i should know Why i've never met him. Okay, fair enough. But i only have time for The reader's digest version, Okay? Your grandpa And your dad, They didn't like Each other very much. Actually, it was A little bit more like They couldn't Stand each other. Why is that? Well-- Truthfully, your dad and i Ran off at a very early age. And i think your grandpa Just always resented him. He resented him for Taking me away from him. How old were you? Times were different Back then, jackson. Let's just say That we were-- We we're very young. Mom, how old were you? Wait a minute, If you're 33 and i'm 16-- 17. I was 17 when i had you. Jackson, wait.

He wasn't too happy. He's pretty mad at me. He's gonna need A good bit of cooling-off time. Well, trust me, I got things to take his mind Off of his troubles. I got a barn That needs painting. I got fences need mending. Dad, please don't Make me regret this. He's my son. He's my everything. Sending him away, it's-- It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. Hey, i'm gonna take real Good care of your boy. Thank you, dad. I'll give you a call When we get to my place. Okay. Hey, buddy. How's work? Oh, it was all right. I had a car fire last night.

Relax, it can't be that bad. I mean, your husband Was a fireman. I mean, isn't there A pension, savings? Steve didn't have enough time On the fire department To be vested In his pension. Because he was killed On an off-duty accident, He's life insurance from work Didn't even kick in. And savings-- well, All the attorney fees From the accident Blew with those. I don't have anyone Else to turn to. I'm all alone With a baby on the way. I didn't know It was that bad. Look, you and jackson Can come and stay with me. That's sweet dad. This is our house. A home.

Just wanted to see How you're doing. Did you know Your mother and you Were having Financial troubles? No, not really. I know the family of the old Woman who died was suing us. Do you know why? 'Cause the police said That my father fell asleep When he was driving, But they were wrong. He wouldn't do that. Well, sometimes Accident's happen. Not with my dad. He was a hero. Thanks for the food. Now i'm gonna Get back to work. Ho-ho-hold up a minute, son. In this house, we give thanks Before we start eating. Dear heavenly father, we- We thank you For this bountiful meal. We know you provided it. And father i thank you For this time you've given me To spend with my grandson. And, lord, please look After my daughter. Help her find her way Through these tough times. In your name, amen. Well, eat up. Can i ask you something, sir? Shoot. You pray every time you eat? Yes. As a christian, I feel like it's important To thank the lord For how he provide for us. But why? He didn't cook the food Or grow it. True. Men tends the field. But the lord provided it, The lord causes it to grow, And i feel like We ought to thank him for that. I mean, without his provision, We couldn't live. So what are we Gonna do today? Change of plans. You know how to ride? You mean, a horse? I don't think We got any camels, The last time i checked. Yeah, i can ride. My daddy used to take me. Good, good. I figure we go out Deer hunting. We'll spend The morning packing up, It's gonna take us a full day's Ride to get out there and, uh-- Do you know How to shoot a rifle? No, sir. Well, i reckon It's time you learn. Eat up, we got to get ready. It takes a while To saddle up them camels. Stubborn animals. Come on. Here is all right. Before we left, I gave your mom a call. You know, just to let her know We'd be gone a few days. She sends her love. Thanks. I'm glad we stopped to let The horses walk for a while. My legs are starting to hurt. Oh, yeah. Well, we just got A little bit, A little bit more to go On the path, Then we're gonna have To ride again now. We're good to go. Come on. Beautiful country around here This time of year. Yeah. Looks like it might Get cold later. Son, you're gonna find Deer hunting and cold Are kind of synonymous. How much further until We get where we're going? Oh, i think maybe one, Maybe, maybe two hours. All right. All right, then, You've got to lead. Pastor haywood? Yes. You must be ilene. Um, just a second. Put away these hymn... I'll be right with you. If you're too busy, I could come back. Oh, no, no, This is the last one. All done. I'm robert haywood. Nice to meet you. I'm ilene connors. Thank you For seeing me today. I was glad when you called And decided to come in. Principal foster, he said, That you helped him When his dad died. Yeah, that was, uh-- Gosh, about a year ago. His dad had cancer And nate took his passing Really hard. Sorry to hear About your husband. Thank you. It's been, uh, It's been really hard. Steve was everything To jackson and me. Now steve was your husband And jackson is your son, right? Yeah. Jackson just turned 16 And he's struggling. He's really struggling With the loss. Um, he's actually staying With my dad right now. Oh, okay. It's just so hard To move on. I mean, i feel empty. And i know, i know that We have to stop mourning. And i know that We have to move forward, But i can't. You don't have To stop mourning The loss Of your husband yet. The bible says In ecclesiastes 3:4, "there's a time to weep And a time to laugh. There's a time to mourn And a time to dance." What does that mean? Well, i think it means That in this crazy life, There are times When we just need to mourn. But it also carries A promise that That time of mourning Is gonna come to an end, And it's gonna be followed By a chance to live again. Live. I don't know how to live Without steve. We had so many Things planned. Yeah, i know. Sometimes the plans We have for our lives Just don't seem to match up With god's plans. God. God? Why would god Do this to me? I mean, why would god Do this to us? What could possibly Be his reason? I'm not saying That god did this, But i do know he has a plan. I know it's kind of hard To leave it at that And it certainly Won't satisfy your desires To know all of the why's, But sometimes that's all We get this side of heaven. Let me read something to you. This is out of Mark 15:35. "my god, my god, Why hast thou forsaken me?" Who said that? Uh, jesus. Jesus? Yeah. When faced with death, Even our lord questioned. So, how do we, Here on earth, Deal with death? I... I think dealing with death This side of eternity Is simply comes down To a matter of living. Uh, i know That sounds simple. Ilene, we must go on living Until the lord calls us home. My mom, she used to read To me from the bible. We used to go to church Every sunday. That was before she died. After she passed, Dad just stopped taking us. I haven't picked up A bible in years. Oh, yeah? How old were you When your mom passed? I was 14. Well, girl, i think It's about time You start reading again. The bible. Yeah. It's not just The words of our savior, Those are the words of life. How is it coming With that tent, son? Good, sir. I'll be right there. Okay. I'm gonna Get supper ready. Hey, how do you like Your filet mignon? We're having filet mignon? No. No, franks and beans. I was just seeing What your preference was, You know, for steaks For future reference. Here you go, grandpa. Hey, thank you, son. So, how long ago Did your wife die, sir? She went to be with the lord More than 20 years ago. Everyone always says that When someone dies That they went to be With the lord, But what does That mean? Well, son, We christians know, We get to heaven By getting right with god. Getting right with god? Yeah, by beginning A relationship with him Through his son, Jesus christ. Makes me think of One of my favorite verses. John 3:16, "for god So loved the world That he gave his only son That whoever believes in him Should not perish, But have eternal life." Perish, does That mean to die? Yes, in a physical sense. Eternal life refers To one's soul living on After we've left Our worldly bodies behind. It's all in here, son. What is it? Salvation. Salvation. How to be saved, How to get to heaven. The goods. How does someone Get to heaven? Jesus, in the book of mark, Was talking with his disciples About just that. And he said to them, "children, how hard it is To enter the kingdom of god," He said, "it's easier for a camel To go through The eye of a needle Than for someone who is rich To enter the kingdom of god." And he says that they Were greatly astounded. And they said To one another, "how then can Anyone be saved?" And jesus said to them, "for mortals, It is impossible, But not for god. For god, all things Are possible." Okay, but what does God mean by that? He means the gift Of salvation Is just that, a gift. It's not something we earn Through our own efforts. Gift? What kind of gift? The gift of salvation Accomplished through The sacrificial death And resurrection of jesus. In mark 10:45, jesus said, "for even i, the son of man, Came not to be served, But to serve And to give my life As a ransom for many." So through jesus's Death on the cross, We are free from that Deadly grip of sin. So jesus came down here And died for our sins? Yup. It's all in there, son. I want you to have that. That was your Grandmother's. Well, i can't pay that. That's why we had insurance. Well then, what are we paying The premiums for? There's no way I'm paying that. Sue me? Sue me. I just got one thing To say to that, buddy, Get in line. I think it's about time You start reading again. The bible? Yeah, it's not just The words of our savior, Those are the Words of life. Can i ask you A question, sir? Yes, you can. I understand that jesus came Down and died for our sins, But how does one Become a christian? A decision, comes Down to a decision. A decision? That's it? Well, some folks Make it sound much harder. But yes, the lord Has left it up to us. I mean, he gave us an example, He showed us the way, But each individual Has to make a decision To allow the lord jesus Into their heart And to follow his examples. His example? Jesus didn't just Come to earth To die for our sins, He did that. He also came To show us how to live. John 13:15, "i've set you an example That you should live and do As i have lived and done." Okay, but what kind of example? Well, forgiveness For one thing. Forgiveness? Everyone says sorry Every now and then. No, i'm talking about True forgiveness. For example, how Would you feel about Forgiving the fellow Who gave you that shiner? He doesn't deserve Forgiveness. That guy's a jerk. That's not what I asked you. I didn't ask you if he Deserve forgiveness. He probably doesn't. I asked if you were Willing to forgive him. So jesus forgave some guy Who punched him in the face? No, jesus Forgave someone Who put nails in his Hands and his feet, Put him on a Wooden cross, Hung him there, And left him to die. With his last breath, He forgave them. That, son, is an example Of pure forgiveness. What do you want For dinner? What are my choices? Well, we've got Franks and beans Or beans and franks. Well, that's a tough Call, grandpa, But i think i'm gonna go With franks and beans. Okay, grandson, Franks and beans it is, Coming right up. Hey, while i get This supper ready, Why don't you check on the Tent, make sure it's secure. We've got some weather Coming tonight. Rain? Yeah, it shouldn't be too bad. So much for that light rain That we were expecting. Stay here, i'm gonna check On the horses. Yes, sir. Granddad? Granddad. Granddad, wake up. Granddad. Come on, granddad. Everybody has to decide To ask the lord Into their heart And turn their lives Over to him. Lord, i need you. Help me! I don't want To walk alone anymore. Come into my heart And fill me with your light. I turn myself Over to you completely. Lord, i know This is my decision. If this is My last night on earth, I want to spend it As your child. Granddad. Wake up, granddad. Get a fire. We need fire. Lamp. Get the lamp. The lamp? Kerosene. I'm gonna make Some breakfast. Yeah. Pills, i need my pills. They're gone. Do you have more? No, that was all. Horses. They're gone. I looked around this morning, But there's no sign of them. You've got to go get some Help and bring it back. I can't leave you Here, granddad. There's gonna be Another storm tonight. Son, son, You've got to go Get some help. Granddad, you couldn't survive One night out here by yourself. I'm not leaving you. Ten miles to the Nearest road, Nearly about straight To east, basically, Follow the river. I'm way too weak To walk it out. I could build something To carry you out. It ain't never Gonna work. Aah! Lord, give me The strength. I can't do it-- I can't do it alone. Come on, grandpa. Aah! Hey! Help me! Help me! What's wrong? Is he dead? My grandfather, He's hurt. We need help. He needs a doctor.
