- Help me! - You are here. I know you are. - You're fucking disgusting you son of a bitch. What do you want from me? - Its okay, here. Don't do it! - Thank you. - Thank you. - All weekend in a fucking hole. No cell phones and we can't tell anyone. - And we even have to pay for it. - We had to pay to get the permit. No permit, no thesis. Get it now? - Well, if I'm paying, I should get to decide what to do and what to bring. - Go tell Nora and she will kick you outta the group. - Fuck you. - Stop it! - What's wrong with you? You're at the bottom of the class. Don't go lower. - You're such an ass kisser. I'm not the only one who thinks like this. Right girls? - Nora was very clear. - No cell phones and no one must know where we are. - Great, stick to the rules. I'm not covering for any of you. - Good. I'm glad to see all of you getting along. The spirit is very important. Let's get going. - Nora, tell us about the guy who's meeting us. - Is he cute? He's mad. - I don't know anything about him. He was a nightmare to contact. Giulia, slow down. It's not a race. Hey, where's Polly? - Oh no, We've lost one already. - Polly! Polly! Polly! Polly! - Sorry, I needed the bathroom! and then I stopped to watch some squirrels. They were so cute! - Well, thank God we found Alice in Wonderland. - Don't do anything without telling me first. No one must go off on their own. Come on, let's go! - Nora is right there are snakes here. - Cut it out, we are not in a jungle. - So what's that on your shoe? - Bitch. You are sick. - Giulia, get down. He should be here. - Can't see anyone. - Looks like he's a no show. - This must be him. Hi, I'm Nora. You made arrangements with me. - Sorry I'm late. - So are we staying out here all weekend? - You keep this. We need to call the driver on Monday. Turn it off for now. - No signal anyway. - The light is poor inside, but your eyes will get used to it. - And you go. - It's freezing. - Thank God I brought some winter clothes. - Come on it's not that bad. - We'll stay in here until Monday morning as arranged. Here's what we agreed. - Isn't he going to count it? - Keep close together. There are 17 kilometers of tunnels. It's easy to get lost. This part's open to visitors. The nuclear bar curve isn't. Not ever. - Why is that? - Bureaucracy permits the usual. So how come we're being allowed in then? - Go ahead. On the other side of this door you'll have a unique experience. - Wow. - This place was abandoned after the war, over the years quite a few people tried to shelter here but they were never seen again. - What happened to them? - No one knows. - It hasn't stopped you coming here. You seem to know this place very well. - Giulia, come on. Don't mind her. So see you on Monday. Impressive, right? We're staying here for a weekend. But I think what it must be like if you don't know when or if you'll get out. Come on girls! It's just a weekend! He said that there's a fully equipped place where we can sleep. According to the planets, here. - Oh - This is fully equipped? - Well, this is our base camp. - Sleep on this? No way. Wanna swap? - Come on, the beds on campus aren't much better. - And you've tried plenty. - Okay, settle down. Angela, close the door. - Can someone gimme a hand, please? It's heavy. Thank you. - What a fucking dump. - Okay, girls. No home comforts, no TV, no cell phones. Welcome to life in a nuclear bunker. - Hey, how about this for a plot? Some girls visit a bunker and they get attacked by people who disappeared there years ago and turned into ravenous monsters. - It stinks. What about your serial killer story? - It's in the trash. After 600 pages she couldn't figure out who done it. - Shut up, I want to sleep. And can we turn these fucking lights off? - Nope, they're on all the time. - Breath deeply. You'll feel better. What's up? - It's that shitty food. Isabel, how can I help you? - I'm not used to eating out of cans like you. - You're a bitch. I'll leave you here. - No, please don't go. Sorry. - Are you okay? - I am going to look around. - I'll wait here, but don't be long. Okay? - Isabel. - Isabel. Isabel! - Good morning everyone. Hey, where Isabel and Sonia? - How could they have gotten out? the door was. - Well maybe they wanted to be alone. - Don't be so catty. - They're like chalk and cheese. Why would they go off together? - Opposites attract. Love is in the air. She's stoned already. - I bet they've gone and got themselves lost. - Isabel! Sonia! I had the door closed to avoid this. Okay girls, let's go look for them. - What do we do now? - Let's leave them to find their own way back. - How can you be so uncaring? - Isabel! - Sonia! - Look, it's Isabel's. - Yes it is. - Something must have happened. - Please. Let's try to keep calm. You know, maybe it is better if we split up. - No, let's stick together. - If we split up, we'll find them quicker. Come on. - This place gives me the creeps. Anything could happen. - Drop it! - We have to keep looking for them. - Do you have to smoke in here? - Yeah, Angela and Nora aren't here to bust my balls. Just shut up and keep moving. - Screw you. Cinzia. Cinzia, It's not funny. Cinzia, where are you? Cinzia! - Polly! - I had to team up with a shit head stoner. I'm going to the others. - That hurt, you bitch. - Go on, fuck off. You don't even know where they are. - You're an asshole. - Give me that flashlight. - Come and get it. - Cinzia. Cinzia, please! Let's go look for our friends! - Angela, come on and help us. - There's someone down there. - Maybe they'll come this way. - It's quicker if we go to them. - Cinzia, I'll make you pay for this. Cinzia! - God, Cinzia. - What the fuck! - What the hell is going on? - We're going around in circles. - So where are Polly and Cinzia? - Get away from me! Leave me alone! - Oh, oh, Polly! - What's going on? Where's Cinzia? - Down there in the tunnel. I got away, the wall, she. Spikes in the wall. - What do you mean? What the hell is down there? Take us to Cinzia. - No, no. - I'll go, you stay here with her. - Giulia, come here. Okay. - Jesus Christ. - It's me! Polly was telling the truth. - Oh God. Please stop. Let's get the others and go. Angela has my phone. We can call for help. Giulia, do what I tell you! Come back. - What a stink - My God. Look - Shit, even the fucking water is gone. - Must have been a bear. There must be a place where they can get in. - Yes or maybe wild bores. - With shoes? - We had dirty shoes when we got here. - For fuck sake, Nora! It could be a serial killer or maybe more than one. - Giulia, you're scaring Polly. - You cut it out. You think a bear pushed Cinzia onto those fucking spikes? - No signal. Not even for an emergency call. - So we're trapped in here? - Oh God. - It's him. The door! - Polly! - Polly! - Polly wait! - The door! Polly stop it! - Polly stop it! It doesn't work. - So we must give up? - Giulia help me! - Fuck. - Shit. - Polly! Polly! Polly stop it! - Polly! Get her quick. Okay? - Keep calm! - Polly, Polly! - Polly, Polly! Hey! - Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. - Give me the water. - Jesus! Someone's trying to kill us and you wanna take care of that idiot! - Who the fuck you think you are? No wonder no one's ever thought about you! - Giulia get over yourself. Look what you have done to Polly. Polly. It's okay. - What are we gonna do now? We have to hold out till nine. Tomorrow morning. - We won't get out alive unless we rely on ourselves. - Please, being negative won't help. - That bastard even took the food! Stop wasting that! - Giulia! - We need water too. - Look. - Hurry, don't let him get in. - He'll get us. - He'll kill us all. - Grab something. - Arm yourself! - You're right. We got to face him!. Hurry! - Be careful, Nora. - Stay where you are, I'm coming. - You stay there. - Call if you need, Nora. - See if you can find a way out. - God, Nora! Nora, Nora what happened? What happened? - I felt his presence. Come on, come on. Betty help, please. - Okay. - It was horrible. - Help me to barricade it. Put the litter in here. - Okay. - Oh god no. Polly! - That bastard. He lured us outside and came in and got her. - We're only gone a couple of minutes. - There must be another way in. He knows this place inside out. - Let's get some rest. Giulia, give me that. I'll keep the first watch. - Like fuck! I'm not going to wait here to die. - Oh, please cut it out. - Don't come any closer. - Giulia! - What's really going on Nora? You brought us here. You split us up by sending Cinzia and Polly off on their own. - What are you talking about? I was attacked too! - Yes, but you got away. - So did Polly. - It's too late for Polly! - It was you who ran outside when the door opened. We followed you and your sidekick came in and got her. - Giulia, are you serious? - I'm just joining the dots. - No, stop it! Stop it! - What the hell are you doing? You're crazy. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. - Keep still. Try to breathe deeply. You're gonna be okay. We need to pull it out. - Give me the belt. - No, no. No! - This is crazy! You're wrong about me. - Shut up and walk. - Giulia, help me with Angela. - Oh shit. - Please, please. Let's stop for a moment. My leg. - Fuck, we are lost. We didn't come this way. Hey, where's Betty? - We just can't leave her. We must go back. - I don't give a shit about Betty. Listen, if you know another way out, tell us now. - I know as much about this place as you do. Let's go back for Betty! - No, there's no way I'm turning back now. - Betty helped me. - Please let me go. - Move your ass or I'll leave you here too. - Fuck you! - It's your damn fault I can't walk. - Shut up you two! - It's behind us. Quickly! - Screw you! Your little bitch. I'm not leaving Angela! - Huh? Help us! - You can do what you want. but please don't hurt me. - You want me to strip? Huh? - Shut up. Shut up! Lean against the wall. - Okay, okay. - It should be here. - Come on. This wind must be coming from that door. It could be a way out. The wind's not coming from here. - What are you doing? You can't. - Giulia, open the door! - If you open that door, I'll break your neck. - Don't leave me here! Don't leave me here! - Oh shit. Someone's in here. Someone's in here! - He got her. Happy now? Look where we are. Thanks to you and Angela. How could you? - Okay, I was wrong about you but Angela would have slowed us down. - Ah no! Why?! Why?! Why me?! No, no no! No! No, no! - Listen Maybe we'll die too. But I won't make it easy for that bastard. - I will attract his attention and at the right moment. - I'll stick this up his ass. - Hey I'm here. Come on, miss you. What the fuck are you waiting for? I'm here! Son of a bitch! Come on! What are you waiting for?! Come on! Come and get me! - Come on Nora, bring him to me. Make him turn his back on me. - Die! - Sorry Nora. - Nora was very clear. No cell phones and no one must know were we are. - This place must been cursed. - Wow Betty, you look great! - With friends like that. - Why studying History if you wanna write scary stories? - Betty helped me! - Giulia! - Giulia, open the door! - Giulia slow down its not a race! - How about this for a plot? Some girls visit a bunker and they get attacked by people who disappeared there years ago. - Who the fuck you think you are? - Giulia, open the door! Someone is in here! - Have the door closed to avoid this. - Down there in the tunnel. - Shut up, I want to sleep! - Masks. - Surprised to see me? You son of a bitch Did you see that bastard's body? Is he your brother? Or just an asshole like you? I don't give a shit. He's dead and you're gonna die too! - I saw you dead. Why have you done this? - I'm what you see in front of you. My father raised me like this. And I'll do the same with my son. Don't be scared. I won't eat you. I need you. I realize you are special. I'll raise him like my father raised me. - Please. Please! Please! - What do you wanna tell me? - Don't hurt my baby. - Mommy, I'm hungry!
