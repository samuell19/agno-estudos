In the beginning there was man, and, man, did he have problems. But he tried to solve them, just as you and I. And when he did solve them, he didn't know it, just as you and I. But man and civilization and the wheel moved forward. And wheeler-dealers like this chap helped. Until finally, modern know-how took over. And look what happened. You might call this a test for Sunday drivers. And the winner gets a free ticket to the freeway of his choice. But wheels have other uses. This young man is Sonny Leander Fox. Leander is a young man who wants to go places, and he will. He's a racing man by trade and by day, but at night he moonlights by hauling moonshine. This practice is frowned on by the Internal Revenue men who believe that alcohol and gasoline shouldn't mix. But a car like Leander's isn't just a bearer of booze. Souped-up getaway cars like this were used on weekends for competitive racing, the birth of stock car racing. It started in the south, then swept the country all the way from the East Coast to sunny California. The men in races like these are experts, the real pros. And here is one of them. His name is Dave Owens. He's young, but he's good, and he's coming up. And like Leander, he's a young man who wants to be noticed. He will be. They call this the proving ground for the automotive industry. It's the steel, they have to test it. How much can it take? There he is, Dave Owens in car number 43. The second spot to ED Martin and 3rd place held down by Charlie Freeman. Watch as James Kirby in car number 10 has lost it in turn number 5. And the battle still goes on for that first place, With Dave Owens holding a 12-second lead over Charlie Garlund in car number 45. Keep your eye on Ed Stern in that 05 car. He's having handling problems in the engine. He's off the track and rolling up on his side. But the driver is okay. In lap number 170, it is still Dave Owens in the lead. Hold it. Kip Smiley is going into turn 9 too fast. He's lost it! Rolling over and over, high into the air and over the wall. We'll give you a report on this driver as soon as possible. Going across the start-finish line, it's still Dave Owens in the Plymouth number 43, out in front with a 14-second lead over second-place car number 45. Dave Owens starting to stretch the lead, gaining two seconds in that last lap. These drivers are reaching speeds of 165 miles an hour down the back straightaway. Can young Dave Owens keep up his grueling pace? Car number 29 in trouble down at turn number 8. He's in trouble. that's Johnny Huff. Bob Hosey in car number 33 is clear up over the wall. There's the signal from turn number 9. Bob Hosey is okay. The leaders are pouring it on through turn number 8 and Dave Owens is passing car after car, trying to stretch that lead. Joe Jackson off of the track in car number 162. And he's all right. We're on to the final lap, and out of turn number 9 Comes your leader Dave Owens in car number 43. What a great driving job this Dave Owens has done today, beating the cream of stock car racing. As five hours of racing comes to a close, here's the checkered flag, and for the first time a rookie has won the Riverside 500. But that's not all that wheels are used for. They're used for work and they're used for pleasure. -Ow! -Papa! Papa! Papa! See you next year, baby. Dave! Dave, come back! Come back, Dave! Dave!

Somebody packing a reputation? Now we're gonna talk about you. It's an idea. You got a name I should know? A pretty good one. Dave Owens. I won't bust up your garage if you haven't heard of it. I heard of you. You're chugging up the wrong track, boy. Leander Fox? He wins most of the races run around here. I know. He's got a big head. I'm here to shrink it. Not in that car, you ain't. It's too new. We run an early modified. Besides, our little old dirt track might confuse you after winning Riverside. How long has it been since you raced on dirt? Oh, I keep in practice. I don't like no killers on my track. You want to drop out to the fairgrounds and show off, there might be a car waiting. How's four o'clock? Fine. My name is Charlie Bigg. That's Bigg with two Gs.

Dave Owens. Oh, yeah, I've heard of you. You're gonna get a chance to see me. Bless my soul. Maybe the little man from California can learn me something.

What's that? "Behind every pretty girl is a behind." Jane! You're not the backward type, are you? Neither are you. I guess I had you figured all wrong. What's that supposed to mean? Well, that song you sang yesterday, it made me blush. Wait, don't run away. I just wanted to tell you that I liked the way you sing. I guess this is where I say "thank you." You don't have to. It's just that, uh, well, I sing a little myself. I thought maybe we can get to be a duet. Janie girl. You're Jane's uncle? Well, son, the way I like to look at it, Jane's my niece, But what can I do for you? I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Dave Owens, the Fireball. He means his car, not himself. He's that California charger that come down south here to show us how it's done. Yeah, I'll be driving one of Charlie Bigg's cars. Hey, fella, you're coming up fast. That's right. My next stop is probably Daytona. You thinking on Daytona? And that's not the end of the line. I figure Indianapolis and I'll get along real well. Your shyness won't get in the way, but you better watch out for Leander over there. He generally smokes everybody off the track. Leander's gonna see some smoke himself today. If you can drive like you talk. Now, don't chide the boy, Janie. I gotta get this race rolling. Son, go get in your car. 'Cause every winner goes to dinner. Who knows? I might strap you with a big fat check. Don't worry, I'll win it. Well... All right, men. you know the rules. Once around the track for the warm-up, bring them back here even with me, and old Chuck here is gonna pop the green. Get out there, Chuck. Well, you heard Big Jaw Harris set up the rules and now we're ready to go, and I do mean go. I've been traveling the circuit, and this has to be one to watch. Young Dave Owens from Fresno is here to challenge the local favorite Leander Fox. Dave, who won the Riverside 500, is hoping to keep it that way. Leander, just as hot as Dave, he doesn't know what it means to lose. Dave is out to show him, and Leander is out to keep his record. That kid in our car, he's the one I was telling you about. He makes that old coffin really scream. I'm more interested in the driver than the car. ...$1,500. Leander Fox will set the speed as they come down for the green flag. Out of the north turn, here they come. There's the green flag, and the race is under way. Into the first turn, it's Dave Owens into the lead. Second spot... look out. car number 4 has lost it. Foster Hotard is out of the car and okay. Your leader is the 88 car, Dave Owens. Second place is the local favorite Leander Fox in car number 44. It looks like a battle of the west against the south. Out of the north turn, it's still a two-way fight for first and second. Leander, charging to close up the gap on the leader, Dave Owens in the 88 car. Jim Gillard in the 4x car spins out, taking the 12 car, Roy Adams, with him. At the end of 12 laps, it's still Dave Owens into the lead. Leander Fox in car number 44, driving hard to catch the leader. Remember, this race is not won until the checkered flag. There goes a lot of passing, going on in the back in the pack as all cars try to move up. Dave Owens is doing a great job of holding down first place. This is his first time on the dirt here in the south and he's proving he can drive anywhere. Car number 66, Frank McCabe, slams into the 24 car, putting them both out of the race. On the back straightaway, pouring it on, Dave Owens in the Charlie Bigg car, still in the lead. Thirty-one car loses it on the south turn, and another car spins. In the back straightaway, car number 23, the hood flies up. The driver still trying to maintain his position, as this is a big money race. Watch the starter. There goes the black flag. Out of the north turn, Leander Fox, cutting down to the inside, trying to pass the 111 car driven by Terry Solomon. Leander is using every trick in the book to catch Dave Owens, the West Coast boy who has driven a great race here today. Time is running out as we go into the final lap. All drivers trying to get one more mile of speed out of their cars to get into the money. But it looks like it will be Dave Owens' race. There's the white flag and one more lap to go. If Dave Owens wins this one, it will be the first defeat of the local hero, Leander Fox. And knowing this boy, he's not going to like it. Well, we'll follow them around on the final lap into the back straightaway. Here comes your leader, almost a quarter of a lap ahead of second place. Into the north turn, the 88 car heads for the finish line. There's that checkered flag. Dave Owens is the winner. Well, what do you think? I think he'll do just fine. All right, Charlie. Ladies and gentlemen, this old boy's done won himself a race. Mr. Dave Owens the winner, driving Charlie Bigg's car, Chug-A-Lug. It gives me great pleasure, young fella, to present you that check of 1,500 frogskins. And la-di-da. -You are good. -And I sing, too. Hey, that was a pretty good run. You planning to play the circuit? That's right. The circuit and the field. Hey, can I talk to you for a minute? Uh, private. Why not? See you around? That's where I'll be. Dave Owens, this here is Miss Martha Brian. -Hello there. -Hi. Martha Brian here has a good proposition for you. I'm listening. There's a cross-country race coming up. I'd like to enter you in it. Are you big around here? I own this track, along with other things. It's a night race along country roads. Now, they're mean. Oh, I'm meaner. Do I get to run my own car? I want you to test one of mine. And I need the best driver around at the wheel. Thanks. Uh... When is this race? Later on in the week. But I want the car tried out first, just to be sure. Like when? Like tonight, eight o'clock. Charlie will tell you where. And if you win this cross-country race, there's no limit to the prizes you might get. I'll remember that. See you at 8:00. What's her story? Among other things, her husband provided her with a great deal of money. I also like what nature did for her. You work for her? Yeah, I kind of handle her affairs. What else do you handle? Nothin', boy. Where's the husband? Well, Martha has an amazing amount of energy. She's very vital and vigorous and her husband took on the enormous job of keeping her happy. He got tired and died. That's the only way to go. He was smilin'. Over here, boy. Nice lonely spot. Yeah, isn't it? Did, uh, you forget to tell me something I should've heard? What's the matter, boy? I'm asking you. Don't worry. Martha Brian will fill you in. She's waiting for you at the other end of the run. Come on. There she is. A beaut, huh? I'll know better when I get her on the road. You getting ready to throw a party? Oh, I-I sometimes make up a little white lightnin'. For the church social. Don't trip on that sour mash. She looks a little low slung in the rear. Yeah, well, I had that done special. See, it'll give you a little more traction on some of these country roads. Now, here's a map I made out. Now, here's where we are. You just follow this line. See? That's an old country road till there, then you hit the main highway till you get down to here. Follow that? So far, it's the only thing I can follow. Then we're set. I just throw open 'em doors, and you're on your way. Any questions? You are kidding. On your way, boy. Martha Brian is waiting. Oh, by the way, I-I heard about that there may be one other car or two gonna make the same run. Your job is to lose 'em. Listen, with Martha Brian on the other end of the line, I could lose Parnelli Jones. Charlie will be pleased. That's the best timing we ever had. Well, with a good man at the wheel, how can you lose? Anybody follow you? Yeah. There was a car tailing me for a while. Why? He kidding? The man tailing you was a Revenuer. Come on, you're putting me on. Revenuers go back to moonshine days. Them days is still with us. Biggest business in this whole state. Them that ain't sellin' it is drinkin' it. Sometimes it's a little of both. Just shows you what us city boys don't know. Take a look. Come here. Phew! It sure ain't gasoline. It sure ain't. Not the prices we get. Have a taste. No, thanks. I'm a straight gasoline man. You may be right. Sometimes gas got a bit of flavor to it. Pretty good batch this time. All right, I'll ask you again. Why? I thought you were the kind of man who liked excitement. I get plenty. I also thought of you as a man who liked money. Here's $300 for starters. A speedy guy like you could make maybe 10 runs a night. That adds up to 3,000 reasons why I thought you'd like the idea. You could do a lot with the money. Not in jail, I couldn't. You can take her out right now. Old Charlie will be wanting the car back. You mean for a refill? If he's got another batch ready, you'll get another trip. Sorry, pal, I just made my last run. You will give me a ride home, won't you, Davey? I guess it's better than walking. You can just slide yourself right in. You're cute. Hey, stick this where no one can see it, Least of all you. Well, I'll open up the door for you. We have a lot in common, Dave. We could have fun together. Cheating who? That's my place up ahead there. Pretty nice spread. Why don't we stop? Have a drink, talk? Said the spider to the fly. You're missing a good bet not coming in with Charlie and me. I'm missing a bigger bet not coming in with you. Find yourself another boy. There aren't any others around, not like you. People in this town bore me. Oh? The nights are lonely, and as they drag on, I get restless. The evening's just begun. Why don't you relax? I seem to be getting restless early tonight. How'd you do, boy? From where I stand, it looks like he done real good. Shut up, Leander. Believe me, we came straight here, no stops. And that's not virtue speaking, it's frustration. Sure. Hey, just what are you trying to stir up, Leander? Nothin'. What are you doing around here, anyway? Why don't you go home to your own still? Go on, get out of here. Look, no offense, Charlie, I've just come to congratulate the new boy. Welcome to the club. I didn't join any club. Look, I left the loot with your man in town, so you got a free ride. He fooled us, Charlie. How come? You know what I think? I think he's chicken. That's right. And I don't think it stops with moonshining either. I think the yellow streak runs all the way to the track. There are two things I don't like about you, Leander: You think too much, and you talk too much. It's a damn shame. It would have been fun. There'll be another time. Hey, I'm, uh, thinking again. Maybe we can do our talking with cars. Unless, like I say, you're a... chicken. Try me. You ever run the Figure 8? I've seen it. You wanna try it? You and me, head and head? I don't see much point in it, but if you have to prove something, I'll play. That's playing rough, Dave. Somebody could get hurt. Hey, only chickens get hurt. Then start cackling, sonny boy. You know, I like that boy. Yeah. Ooh, that's strong stuff. Folks, what you're about to see here today, you won't believe it with your own eyes until you see it. For the first time in history, it's a Figure 8 chicken race. Now, don't ask me what that is, 'cause I ain't at liberty to tell you. But you've got the answer right there in your pants pocket. So dig down deep, bring out a $1 bill, lay it on that drum and I promise you somethin', you'll have somethin' to tell your friends and neighbors who are not fortunate enough to be out here today. This is so good that I'm gonna buy the first ticket myself. Here you are, Ray. I'll get that ticket later. Now, folks, step right up here. Get the bargain of the century. All right, Davey. Instead of us both starting at the top of the 8, going in the same direction, You start here, I start there. Wait, wait, wait. Let me show you. Here's your 8. You start here, go around here. I start here, go around the other way. Could get a little trafficky in the middle, huh? That's the name of the game. You get here first, you won't get hurt. Don't worry. I'll be long gone by the time you get here. -Hey, sonny boy. -Yeah? I got a hunch who the real winner's gonna be. You little darlings are gonna get in for nothin'. Gift from old big Jaw Harris. Go on in. Fellas, this is Joey. He's gonna be your starter. Now, you all set? Give 'em a good show. Crazy kids. I kind of like the idea. A good chance both those young people might get killed. Don't worry, honey. Seems like I never get things my way. Leander, are you all right? Hey, how about me? I think you're both crazy. I see you boys are almost indestructible. I like that in a man. Dave, call me later. Better still, you know where I live. Just come on over and kick the door open. Charlie. You men are all alike. One pretty ankle... Ankle? Honey, you aren't even warm. Hey, how come you're concerned? I mean, about me being concerned about somebody else? Yeah, I'd like to hear the answer to that myself. Well, it's just that a minute ago, you might have been killed. Now, wait a second, you sound a little mixed up. You're supposed to be his girl. I don't like being part of a mob scene. When you make up your mind to be a joiner, let me know. Well, well. Oh, well, let's get on with it. Now that I'm among the living, maybe you and I can live a little. - I'll have to think about it. - David, my boy. I couldn't be any prouder of you if you were my own son. I'm kind of glad I'm not. I've got plans. Big plans. The big race Sunday. You win that, and then we're off to Daytona. Nobody can tell where we're going from there. I could tell you. I could tell you both where to go if I weren't a lady. Is she insinuating something? You don't think much of racing, do you? You're an authority on the subject. What sort of a life is it? Well, if you hit the top, it's great: plenty of money, lots of laughs, name in headlines, and it's amazing how the women go for you. Even women you'd never expect. Is it all that good? Depends on how good you drive. If you don't get killed, it's all that good. If. Dave Owens? So far, so good. Excuse me. Why don't you come right on in? Internal Revenue? I'm Jack Hastings. This is Fred Bronson. We've got something to talk about. Well, don't let me stop you. That was a pretty nice run you made the other night. Yeah. I'm doing a tryout for a cross-country shot. Hey, fella, you lose something? Let's play this straight, Dave. Running booze is a federal crime. Look, I didn't know I was carrying booze when I made that run. It's still a crime. But we've got no beef against you, Dave. You could help us. That's why we're here. There's a nasty word for what you're suggesting. I said help. Now, this isn't just petty crime. They're sending that stuff all over the country. It's big business. Forget it. I'm not your boy. I'm afraid you are, Dave. The run you made adds up to six months in jail. That kinda kicks the floor out from under your, uh, racing season, doesn't it? Looks like I'm hooked. Call me here tomorrow. We'll take it from there. Copping out, lover? You always believe everything you hear? You wanna translate that? I don't care who makes the booze around here, who buys it, or who sells it. My business is racing, and you heard what they said about that. I still don't get the translation. Like I said, my business is racing. You're crazy, you know that? You know something? You're stubborn. You kind of wear a guy down. Are you getting worn down? Well, are you? I'm getting used to you. That's not enough. Well, maybe you're not enough. Well, I guess it's late enough for me to say it's late. Look, uh, I'm sorry. I got a lot of bad habits. One of them is telling the truth. Sometimes it's better that way. All right, Joey, that's enough. Turn her off. All right, now take the rest of this stuff, put it in the back of the car. When you're all finished loading, put her on the road. Charlie, we should talk. Private. In the office. I had some visitors last night, Charlie. So? They knew about the run I made. They asked me to help 'em. I told them I'd go along with 'em. Only I give them a dipsy. What I tell 'em will have 'em chasin' their tails. And you're doin' all this 'cause you love me, huh? It's got nothin' to do with you, Charlie. I go along with these guys, or I spend six months in some crummy jail instead of going to Daytona. So I fake it, and nobody gets hurt. I ain't buying, boy. He's telling you the truth. Last night, two federal men came to Dave's motel room. How do you know that? I was there. You was in the motel? You... We're Charlie's helpers. Maybe we ought to help. Don't think Charlie would like that. He's a mighty proud man. We could ask. Charlie's busy. How come? I don't know. He has no right. Are you asking me to believe that? About the only thing you and I do have in common is I tell the truth, too. I believe that. Let's get out of here. Mr. Peepers, ready for duty. You'll get over thinking it's funny. I want you to start driving for Charlie as a regular. Get his confidence. That won't be easy. You see, his chin ran into my fist this morning. When I left, he was sleeping peacefully. What's the problem? Nothing you'd care about. All right. Then I want you to apologize. Tell him you're sorry, anything. If we can nail Charlie down, we can start boarding up this whole area. I don't like it. But I don't like jail, either. That's all for now, Dave. Keep in touch. You can mail the medal to me in care of the Boy Scouts of America. Remember this: You get one inch out of line, one inch, I'm gonna jump all over you with both feet. Listen, you got something on me, do something about it. Otherwise, don't needle me. You never learn, you guys, do you? You're hard. You don't bend, but you break. You break when the load gets too heavy. Why don't you learn to relax a little? Roll with it. Let it happen. You can throw me out if you want to. Forget it. It was my fault. Martha runs her own life. I butted in where I don't belong. Who knows? Maybe you've done me a favor. Maybe you can do one for me. Name it, we'll see. I'd like to drive for you as a regular. Racing ain't enough? Racing's okay. I'm in the big one Sunday. But I've changed my mind about the money. Yours is as good as anybody else's. You available for a run tonight? How come you're not asking about the Feds? You told me you weren't doing business. I believe you. Okay. What time and where? Eleven o'clock. The shed. All right, Joey. On your way. How about me, pal? You're next. Hey, I saw that race. You had a better seat than I did. Leander's never been taken out before. About time. I wasn't really racing Leander. I was riding to win. That's my business. It's gonna be mine someday, too. Okay, Joey, take it away. All right, Jobber. Joey. Headlights... around the bend... comin' at me. I had to chicken. I had to. Is anybody home? Hello. And I was beginning to think you weren't human. More than you think. Fix us a drink. I'll be right out. It's late. Yeah. Where have you been? Seeing how the other half dies. Are you in trouble? Somebody's up to their eyes in trouble. You want to tell me about it? Joey was killed tonight. He was run off the road. I don't know who did it. Do you? Maybe it was an accident. Not with all the booze gone. When I said I wasn't gonna talk to the Feds, I didn't know the game got this rough. It never has before. Hastings? Listen, I just came off a run. Get up to Summit Hill right away. At the bend. There's a car in the gully there. Yeah, the guy in the car, he's wiped out, too. I don't know. That's your job. Oh, Hastings, you're right. I got over thinking it's funny. Does Charlie know about this? Not yet. I keep thinking Leander. I keep thinking it was me he was after. I must say, you've given him a lot of reasons. But how do you prove it? I make another run tomorrow night. Joey said the other car came straight at him. Joey chickened. I won't. Whatever it is, let it go. You're nervous. What are you so nervous about? I don't know, but I am. I'm shaking, I'm so nervous. Dave... do you like me? Do you like me at all? Leander! Here! Leander. Leander. Your public calls you, my friend. My public is private, right here. Do you want to make every girl in the county unhappy? If I could just make one of them happy, I'd go for that. Leander, can you bust your way out of this shindig? We gotta talk. Hi, Jane. Tacit, gents. Tacit. Ladies and gents, boys and girls, we got a celebrity here. Well, I got a surprise for you, and for him, too. He's gonna sing for you, and if you like him, I wish you'd throw a little money up on this stage, maybe at me. Here's that swingin' singin' man, Mr. Dave Owens. How about it, Dave? Go on, Dave. I hear you've been doing quite a bit of singing lately. We'll talk about that later. Listen to this, good old boy. Hey, fellows, can you play "My Way That Gets Me My Way"? "F." I'm the winner of the race I'm a man among men I'm the king Who plays the ace Everybody calls me Their friend It's just My way of walking My way of talking My way that gets me My way, yeah I'm a lover of the girls Proud to say that I am They're the greatest In the world They know I'm their lovin' man It's just My way of walking My way of talking My way that gets me My way, yeah Just the way I play the game People say that I am smart Guess I'll make The Hall of Fame That only proves I've got heart It's just My way of walking My way of talking My way that gets me My way, yeah It's just My way of walking My way of talking My way That gets me my way All right, sonny boy, let's you and me talk. I got nothing to talk about. Well, I do. Come with me out back. Sit this one out, Jane. Well, what's the good word? Strain. That's the good word. We got strain. I know. I heard about Joey. Is that all you know about it? Hijackers, probably. First killing we had around here. Hope it's the last. So do I. That supposed to mean something? There's a message in there somewhere. Well, maybe you could translate. I'm just a country boy. The message is, I'm doing a run tonight and I don't wanna run into you. What is it? What did Dave want? Nothing. It's, uh, about the race tomorrow. There's trouble, isn't there? Is Dave in trouble? Yeah, I think so. This may sound like a foolish feminine question, but why don't you help him? I can't. He's doing it to himself. Big race tomorrow. Gonna knock Leander out? Maybe even tonight. Dave. Dave, talk to me. Where did you come from? When you didn't show up, I got restless. You know how I am when I'm restless. So I decided to come look for you. Dave, what happened? I don't know, a pair of headlights. That's all I saw. I guess I came in second. Wait, wait. Same as last night. The booze is all gone. Forget it. Forget it? If they had any class, they would've left me some. I could use a drink. Dave, we're heading up the hill. Can you make it? I think I can make it. What happened to you? Oh, I slipped in the bathtub again. You're a clean-cut kid, but is it worth it? Listen, Jane, I've got to talk to you. Out back? Sure, come on. It's about Leander. I want to talk to you about Leander. There was never anything definite between us. But if he whistles, you'll come. Leander isn't ready. He wants his freedom. And what do you want for him? Look, I think this: If you do good work at some job... Besides racing. Save some money, have a family, a nice home, and can live in it as you please, you have freedom. Jane, it's no secret that Leander's mixed up in moonshining. It sort of goes with the territory. The Feds have other ideas. And what about murder? That could have been an accident. It could have been, but it wasn't. And everything points to Leander. Do you think it was Leander? I did, but somehow you make me think I'm wrong. Then who? I don't know. But I'm gonna find out. Hey, you. Yeah, you, Sonny Leander Fox. Hey, why don't you guys split for a while, huh? I heard about what happened. You were lucky. You're so damn innocent. That's right. Everything in me says you're rotten, Leander. You're two pounds in a one-pound bag. When did you get tough? When somebody gets killed. And when somebody tries to kill me. Boy, you are running in circles. Yeah, it's 'cause I'm confused. There's a girl who thinks a lot of you, Leander. It's the way she feels about you, that's what confuses me. If it weren't for that, I'd be sure about you. I usually get my sermons on Sunday, but not from you. I thought you ought to know. I'm making another run tonight. I trust a woman's intuition up to a point. Then I've got to find out for myself. Boy, be my guest. Leander. You on my back, too? Can we talk for a minute? That means, can you talk for a minute? All right, put it that way. Alone. You heard what the young lady said. I think I know what's coming. The farewell address, right? Wrong. I thought you might like to know if you win today, you won't be going to Daytona alone. Oh, forgive and forget? A girl can change her mind, can't she? You better think hard on it. It's a crazy world, and I've decided it's about time I joined it. Janie, do you know what you're sayin'? I'm not sure I'm worth it. I'm willing to gamble on that. It'll be a crazy life in that crazy world. Like a house without a foundation. You want that? You heard what I said. I've always had roots, but roots can be pulled. Maybe sometimes that's good. You fans can look forward to a real battle between the West Coast driver Dave Owens in Big Jaw Harris' car number two And Leander Fox in the 67 car. Also, we're trying something new here today. Everybody runs in all classes. The hardtops, the early models, they're all after the money. It'll be open competition and down at the line, starter Chuck Murray sends them off on the pace lap. Keep your eye on the two lead cars. These are the boys who put on the last great race we had here. And I know there's bad blood between these two and I'm afraid you'll see it come out today. Dave Owens in car number two, you'll remember, won the last race and Leander Fox, the local boy, was beaten for the first time in his career and he'll be trying to win back his crown. The cars are all in good position as we go into turn number one. This will be the pace lap, a chance for all the drivers to check out their cars and warm them up for the main event about to get under way. Out of the north turn, coming down to the front straightaway, the starter looks them over. The green flag is up and the race is under way. Into the first turn, the West Coast boy Dave Owens takes the lead in car number two. Right on his bumper, Leander Fox in car number 67 will be after him all the way. In the back straightaway, car number two holds the lead, and the local hero, Leander Fox in the 67 car, trying to move up to challenge for the lead. Down the front straightaway goes the leader. Real smooth driving by Dave Owens as he again wants to win this one. Leander Fox, the determined one, will try anything to win this one. Through the turns, riding high, using all the track, trying to catch car number two. Into the north turn, cutting wide. Up in the turn two cars tangle, one getting away as number 12 gets back onto the track. The battle still goes on between the leaders, Dave Owens and Leander Fox. What a race this is going to be. Clare Wood now moving up to third spot, Followed by Carl Patrick in car number five. Two cars run together on the straightaway. Both drivers are okay, but they're out of the race. Coming out of turn number four, the leader, Dave Owens, in the number two car really pours it on to stretch that lead. Into the turn, number 167 driven by Mike Reed, spins into the infield as Leander Fox goes by in car number 67, trying to close in on the leader. Dave Owens, the young man from the West Coast, again looks like the winner for the second time. Seems like he takes to the dirt like a professional. Up in the turn, car 66 taps the 24 car. These two tied up in the last race. Car number 24, trying to get into the infield bumps the 23 car, and he's hit by car number 53. Man, are these drivers pushing today. We're down to the last few laps. The drive is really on. Dave Owens, the leader in car number two, Leander Fox in the 67 car has battled his way through the pack. They're running bumper-to-bumper. Out of the north turn, Solomon is going to lose it. What a race. Everybody wants to win, but only one can be the winner. Back in the pack, the drivers are pushing and shoving, trying to gain another spot, they're after the big bucks. Time is running out, and we're down to the finish on this one. Leander Fox, looking for a hole, trying to push through for the lead. Dave Owens holds him off. It looks like a grudge match could be made up between these two drivers. Dave Owens, the West Coast flash, who invaded the South and took away the local boy's crown, has been winning everything. Leander Fox, the opportunist, who, right now, looks like he will be beaten again, is out to regain the top spot with the local fans, has his work cut out for him today if he hopes to win this one. Both drivers are flat out. If both cars hold together, what a finish this will be. Here's the rundown: Dave Owens, the leader, in car number two. Leander Fox, in second place in the 67 car. Reke Houlgate, running third in car number 69. Followed by Bob Russo, who is lapping in the 29 car. That's the way it stacks up as we come down to the wire. Leander Fox, with no place to go, rams the two car and comes through for the win. Why, race fans, there will be fireworks in the pits after this one. Ladies and gentlemen, the winner of the championship open competition is that good old boy, Leander Fox. Come on in here, son. You really showed me some smoke. I'll show you more in Daytona. Well, until Daytona, I'd like to leave you with a little something to remember me by. Let 'em finish it. Come on, boy. Stay back, let them finish. Keep the crowd back, fellas. Keep out Big Jaw, let 'em fight. He's not the winner there. Oh! Janie. If you're planning on running off to Daytona with Leander, you better think on it. -I already have. -But think on it. That last race, the way he won it. Why, he just spun that old California boy right off the track. Do you think that was deliberate? It could have killed him. Leander wouldn't do a thing like that. Maybe not, but say that he did. A man who'd do a thing like that could've run Joey off the side of the road and killed him. Now look, you start traipsing off to Daytona, you just better give that thought another think, do you hear me, young lady? Hey, Owens, you guys put on a better show than Clay and Chuvalo. Funny. Haven't heard from you. Judging from what we saw, we should have. You didn't hear from me because there's nothing to talk about. Maybe we should check with, uh, Miss Martha Brian. You talk to her. If it's about Joey, she doesn't know any more than I do. Murder's a big one, Dave. Do you think it was Leander? Why don't you ask him? You're cops. Do your job. My job is driving. You drive better than you lie. Nobody's perfect. Leander. I was proud of you today, until the fight started. Look, I didn't start that fight. I don't need that kind of action. I'm talking about the one that people think you did start out on the track. You don't need that kind of action, either. You know how I feel, Leander. But I know what's been going on out there in the hills the last couple of nights. Sure, I read the papers, too. Then you better listen for a second. Because if you've had anything to do with it, you can forget about you and me and Daytona. It's like that? Take out the question mark. It's like that, period. It's about time. What were you doin'? I could have died and been buried waiting for you. Not a bad idea. That's no way to talk, Davey boy. I'm ridin' with you. I figure that's one way to prove I'm not ridin' at you. If we don't run into trouble, it doesn't prove anything. Then I gotta hope for trouble, right? You want me to drive? -In this? -Why not? You want to check with Charlie first? No, let's leave Charlie out of this run. I'll drive. The bend is just up ahead. That's where we might get the treatment. Well, if we do, remember, there's no chickens in this coop. Here they come. Stay with it. A mirror. They roll it out, disappear... come back and roll it into those trees. Somebody wants you real bad. You know something funny? It still could be you. Now for a little trap-setting. Come on. All right, now let's make this look good. We'll send her over the hill, and then we'll do some waitin'. Right. Miss Martha Brian was kind enough to give us a phone call. -Hi. -Hi. It was a mirror. It was the glare of his own headlights that drove Joey off the road. We pushed the car over the side to make it look good. All right, get in. We'll back in among those trees and we'll wait. All right, all right, let's clean it up. All right, that's good enough for now. Let's get the booze. All right, hold it, fellas. Stay where you are. Looks like the end of the run for you, Charlie. Hey, so a man grabs a case of booze now and then. And kills somebody trying to get it? Why, Charlie? Why all of a sudden? You know, sometimes a man gets a blind spot. Mine was that lady. I worked out a way to get rid of the competition. Without the kids around, I figured it would be just you and me. I was in love with you, Martha. That's how blind a man can get. Come on, Charlie. Leander. I haven't had a chance to talk to you until now. The track was a little fast between there and here. I can wrap up what I want to say in one sentence. If a woman loves a man, she goes where he goes. I'm going with you. Well, that's two sentences. So, I got carried away. Dave. Good luck, to coin a cliche. I like the sound of that coin. See you later. 44 cars in perfect line on the pace lap for the start of the Daytona 500, with more than $85,000 in prize money up for grabs. The weather is great, and more than 90,000 fans have gathered here today. Out of turn number four, the pace car pulls to the infield, down across the line and we are under way for 500 long miles. Into the first turn, it's Dave Owens in car number 43. He turned in the fastest lap in qualifying, to take the pole position. Starts to pull away from the field. He's running with some of the greatest drivers to ever run in stock car racing. Moving right in behind him in the 56 car, driven by Al Simms, the great Indy driver. In third place is Leander Fox. Out of turn the 61 car, Red Patter, loses a wheel and spins into the infield. Off the track, but the race still goes on. Still your leader is car number 43, Dave Owens. Down in the turn, car number 50 has gone out of control. Coming up to the wall and spinning down in the infield. Real tough luck for car number 50 and the driver. He was holding down fifth place. Into lap number 70, your leader is Dave Owens in car number 43. Driving a smooth and steady pace, he's held the lead all the way from the green flag. Leander Fox, holding down fourth place, is also trying out Daytona for the first time. Coming out of the turn, keep your eye on the 00 car. He's starting to smoke very badly. Here is where the pressure is on the pit crews. Can it be overheating, or has something gone wrong with the engine to put him out of the race? The 00 car is dropping down onto the apron and heading for the pit. All right, back to racing, over in the pits, the 00 car has burst into flames. The whole car is burning, just as the driver moved away. Gasoline is all over. The fire crews are working fast to put out the flames and get the fire under control. The 43 car is still in the lead, and look at this, that's the signal from the pit crews, car number 43 to make his regular pit stop. Car number 43 signals the okay. So it looks like he'll be coming in on the next lap. Down in the far turn, starting to slow down a little, dropping down on the apron and heading for the pit. The crew is swarming all over the wall, the jack goes under the car, the windshield is wiped, the radiator is checked, ten gallons of gas, a complete check of the tires to check on their wear. A drink of water for the driver, a quick check on the oil pressure gauges. The head pitman gives the driver instructions. Dave Owens is out of the pit in 17 and a half seconds, which is near record time. Up in the turn, car number 25 loses it. Jack Thomas spins down the track backwards, sliding down into the apron, and continues to race. All right, here's the rundown at the end of 87 laps. Dave Owens, the young 23-year-old Californian, is still in the lead. This is something new for a rookie, but this is going to be a great driver. Second place is Leander Fox in car number 99, the driver Dave Owens had so much trouble with here on the dirt tracks here in the South. Both drivers are showing their ability here today. Third place and going strong is Tim Reeds, another young California driver. Down in the turn, Eddie Chapman loses control of the 53 car, sliding up against the wall. The 25 car driven by Don Basile, trying to miss him, slides up into the crash wall, blocking the track. And all hell breaks loose. There's cars sliding up the track, down the track. One car is rolling down the center of the track. Cars and drivers doing everything to try to miss. The rolling car catches fire on the apron. Fire crews and ambulances rush to the scene. And here comes the driver out of the burning car, and he looks okay. What an unbelievable job all of these drivers did to keep this wreck no worse than it was. The yellow flag is out. The caution light is on. All drivers will hold their positions until the pace car comes out on the track. All cars will line up behind the pace car. Here are the lead cars at the time of the crash. Dave Owens in car number 43. Leander Fox in car number 99. And running third, Roy Hord in the 78 car. Here comes the pace car. Look out, a car is spinning out trying to keep away from passing the pace car. He's okay. And, race fans, here's the rules from NASCAR, that if you pass the pace car, it's an automatic fine. All right, many drivers are taking advantage of the caution flag for pit stops and an extra chance to keep their car in the race. Here comes Leander Fox in for his pit stop. The 99 car has been in there all the way today. Leander, taking no chances, is using this time under the yellow flag. In a race of 500 miles, anything can happen. Leander, taking on gasoline, a quick windshield wipe, a quick check of everything. This is going to be a fast one, one of the quickest of the day. In and out of the pits in 10 and a half seconds. Right down the pit lane goes the 99 car, heading for the entrance to the track. There's the green light and the race is on. Dave Owens still holds the lead in car number 43 with Leander Fox in car number 99 running 14 seconds behind the second-place man. We're in lap number 239, and the duel is still on. Leander Fox in the 99 car starting to close that gap of 14 seconds between second and first place. Both of these drivers have driven a beautiful race so far. Around they go, lap after lap. Dave Owens putting on all the speed he can get out of that 43 car. These cars are hitting speeds of 175 miles an hour on the straightaway. Leander Fox slowly closing. He's now running six seconds behind the leader. They're passing car after car. They've lapped the field. What a finish this is going to be. Leander's moved up to where he's drafting the 43 car. Both drivers really dumping it on. Leander Fox is inching his way closer and closer to the lead car. A trick of these drivers is to draft right up to the turn, then move out around the lead car. Both of these drivers, new to Daytona, may not have learned this yet, but we'll have to wait and see. Here it is, Leander Fox doing it the hard way. Out around the outside to take over first place from Dave Owens in the 43 car. Leander Fox has learned his lesson well. He pulled a smooth job getting around the 43 car. Dave Owens to take the lead in the final laps. Here's trouble with the 99 car. It's starting to smoke very badly. What a tough break for Leander after a great race here today. We'll keep an eye on him. Still smoking and getting worse. Old Leander's done blown a fuel line. If that hot stuff hits those pipes, he's gonna look like a Roman candle. The 99 car has caught fire, starting in the engine and running clear to the back of the car. Leander Fox is still not slowing down. This could be a bad one. This could be real bad one. The fire is all around the gas tank. Still, he keeps going. Trying to win it on fire. Over in turn one, two more cars have crashed into the wall, Flipped over, and are burning. The number three car, driven by Jack McDonald, flips upside down and is sliding down the straightaway at a terrific speed, spinning around and around. Man, what a slide! Down the straightaway comes Dave Owens in car number 43, now in the lead. Cars are weaving in and around the burning cars. And here comes the 99 car, Leander Fox, still trying to win. He's clear out of his brain bucket. The car has disappeared behind the wall. Race fans, in all my history as an announcer... ...this is the worst fire I have ever witnessed. All we can do is wait for a report from the turn. He's burned pretty badly around the face and hands. He won't be racing anymore, but he'll be all right. You can go in and see him now if you want. Thank you, sir. Jane. I'll take these in to him, honey. Jane, remember, being a camp follower to a race driver is no good. A woman ought to have a home. You remember everything I say. Son, I had you pegged wrong. Thanks for coming by. Well, you can't win 'em all. The doc says you won this one. He also said I'll never play the violin again. You know, it's funny. There you are, laying there, looking like a loser, but yet you've got all the chips in front of you. You busted the game, Leander. I'll send you a postcard. Leander, now that you won't be racing anymore, maybe I can catch up with you. It's up to me now to catch you. He's gonna be okay. What about us? You talkin' home and fireside, or just togetherness? It's up to you. Martha, I'm a drifter. I guess I always will be. A drifter, maybe. But from here on in, as long as I'm around, cross out loner. I need a man. I've noticed. You think I'm enough? When you win your race When you find your star When you know Just who you are Turn around Turn around Turn around Turn around You'll know Where to find me When you win your prize When you climb your hill When you do all You say you will Turn around Turn around Turn around Turn around You'll know Where to find me I'll be here Just for you My heart says you belong Is it right? Is it true? How can my heart be wrong? When you find someone And you fall in love And you find All you're dreaming of Turn around Turn around There I'll be There I'll be That's when you'll find me Look out, world, Here I come I'm a racing son of a gun I'm the fastest Under the sun Fireball 500 You know what? We may have started somethin'.
