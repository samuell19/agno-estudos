I'll be seeing you. Stretch. Remember to clear out that shed. Yeah. And just throw all that stuff away. Okie dokie then, I'll be going. No fooling around, you two. [laughs] Frank, you left the car all locked up. I'm catching a cold waiting here. I don't know what the big deal is about them knowing about us. Jeez. [engine revving] [brakes squealing] Damn it, I forgot to open the shed door. -Why didn't you remind me? -Are you kidding? It's no big thing, Frank. Just get out and open it. Shut up, stupid. I don't wanna. You're crazy is what you are. Wait a minute. [phone ringing] -Hello. [Frank] Sheila. Sheila. Jesus, you calling long distance, huh? What do you want, Frank? I want you to open the shed door, I forgot. What? You do it, Frank. I'm not dressed to be out here. -You do it! -I don't know where the key is. -I had a hard night. -You do it. -Just, just-- -You fucking do it! [engine revving] Fuck you. [tires squealing] What a dweeb. Since he bought that cellular phone, he thinks he's what's-his-name in Hawaii five-O. [door creaking] Frank's kind of rough to work for, huh? He's a cheap, obnoxious bastard. So, Stretch, I think you're finished for now. I'll stock the coolers. What? No, that's too hard for you. No, I did it a million times already. Plus that creeps making you clean out his shed. You should be paid. [faint Irish folk music] Wait. You hear music playing around here. You hear anything? No. Well, I hear it at the oddest times, real faint. [music gets louder] [music becomes ominous] Ruthie, come here, quick. Quick, they're bringing the old girl out. [Ruthie laughing] Yippie! [Lilly] Bullseye! I'll never grow tired of watching that. It picks me up the whole day. Look at the patience of the daughter as she cleans her off. My God, think I'd let the daft old thing wear the porridge. Ruthie, make us disappear. -Now! -No, it's okay. He can't see us unless I want him to. [sighs] [phone ringing] Hello. [heavy breathing down the line] Hello. Okay, whoever you are, breathe away, fuck you. [ominous music] [warped jazz music] My word. Oh, Dolphy, get out of here. I was right in the middle of a solo, too. [alarm clock buzzing] Jesus. [Sheila] You finished yet? I got to get out of here I need some sleep. Yeah, me too. Yeah, fuck Frank. Hey, I scored some pretty good shit, though. I like this chair. I could give this to Marty. [Stretch] Who's Marty? [Sheila] He's my landlord. He wears shark skin suits, you must have seen him around. Oh, man you don't mean that bee-bop, jazz-bop dude that looks like he sleeps in his clothes? With two-toned shoes and shit? Yeah, that's him. Well, I seen him around, he always looks like he's in a bad mood or something. Well, I don't know him that good yet. I don't know, I think he's sort of-- I don't know. [Stretch] So you gonna take the chair? [Sheila] Yeah. [Stretch] All right. I'll help you carry it home. [ominous music] [woman] Kids, get over here! This is it. This is where you live? Yeah, I live upstairs. You live alone? Yeah, why? No reason. So, where do you want me to put it? Just leave it with me. I want to give it to Marty. He's probably still sleeping. He don't wake up till late. Marty's kind of a wacko, I've-- [Sheila hushes Stretch] Oh, fuck. [dog whining] Ruthie! [Ruthie giggles] [humming a tune] What, you don't like this tie? Well, I like this tie. You want some nutrition, Dolphy? Yeah, me too. Oh, Christ man, I'm so tired. I could go right back to sleep. Here. [knocking at door] [ominous music] [door slams shut] Oh! Morning, Martin. You just waking up? Uh, yeah. Hi there, Mrs. Cleary. I thought as this was the 10th anniversary of your father's death I might have seen you at mass this morning. I thought about it last night, but I must have fallen asleep. I'll drop by later, light a candle. I lit one on your behalf and mine. You think of everything, don't you, Mrs. Cleary? Everyone's gone, eh? Everyone's passed on; my Jack, your mom, dad, so many others. I suppose I'm dwelling on their memories, on them, too much. No, not at all, not at all. They haven't entirely gone, either. I know that. I feel that. Does that seem crazy to you? You're asking the wrong person about crazy, but no I don't think so. Martin, I feel I should say something on behalf of your folks. What's become of you of late? You sleep all day and night. You have the look of a lost child. When was the last time you were out of the house? It's not good. You're not all that fond of the world are you? Not fond? No, no, not at all. Well, not all that fond, I guess. You know how it is when you don't have a lot of money, and not very good at making friends, -playing music nobody wants to-- -My gosh! Look at the time, it's half past 12. My sister will be here soon. She's taking me out to that mall in Westlake. 12:30. Fuck, I've got a piano student coming in half hour. I got to move this chair. Okay. [grunts] [knocking at door] Yeah, it's open. Hey, pops. Hey, Tony, how you doing, man? Hope you carved out a little time for some practice. Sure, I'll try it anyway. I feel pretty copacetic about my chops. And that Mozart you gave me, I never heard such crazy sounds. [plays tune on piano] Yeah, that's it. Now you're cooking. Yeah. Wait, wait, wait, move over. Okay, now I'm gonna play the left hand, you just throw it down with your right, okay? Stay with me, concentrate. And... [plays tune on piano] [Marty snoring] [music builds] [soft jazz music] [applause] Hey, pops, hey, Marty. You okay, man? Wow, we really had something going there. Take it from the top, kid. [plays tune on piano] This will never do. It's barely better than the shed. The view is worse and the piano player stinks. When do we get to play some Cecil Taylor? Oh, you got a long way to go yet, Tony. You gotta practice first. Then we'll see about Cecil Taylor. Okay, catch you later. Sure thing, kid. [both] Catch ya. That kid will be ready for Cecil Taylor the same day I do an album for Blue Note. Hey, Dolphy. [faint chatter of radio talk show] Africa? Africa, Night in Tunisia. [scatting a tune] [eerie wailing] What was that? Is somebody there? Who's there? [eerie wailing] Come on, scumbag. [dog barking] It's working. He's coming down the stairs. I remember him. His name, whatever is his name? Oh, shit. Shit, Mister shit? Oh, shit. [eerie wailing] What the fuck? Who's there? [chair squeaking] Come on, who is it? [Ruthie whispering] Marty. Marty. What? There's no one here. [Lilly] Marty. Come on. [Lilly] Take the chair upstairs now. Cold. Jesus. Oh, Jesus. [Lilly] Please, Marty. -I feel cold. [Lilly] Take the rocking chair upstairs. What the fuck? [Lilly] Move back from him child. You're making him faint. Look, if this has got anything to do with something I might have said about Woody Hermen... [Ruthie laughing] I take it all back. I didn't mean it, okay? [Lilly] Marty. Take it easy, Marty. It's just us. [Ruthie laughing] Take the chair upstairs, Marty. Holy shit. Take the stupid chair upstairs, Marty. Take the chair up the stairs. What's the matter? Mind gone on a little vacation there, boy? See anything spooky, Dolphy? [eerie laughing] Dolphy, I think we got company. [eerie laughing] If I were alive, I'd never go to sleep. I'd play and see the world. Me, too. I want that. Not too loud, Ruthie. [ominous music] [gospel music] ♪ In my heart ♪ There's love for you [music stops abruptly] Peek-a-boo. Oh, yeah, peek-a-boo from hell. You're a child, right? You look like a mushroom. And you're dead, or what? Yes. Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus. What about your friend? Just here. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. I must be completely nuts. I've completely gone this time.. I'm still asleep, right? All right, do what you want. Go ahead, do whatever you want. Well, you're dead, right? Yes, we are. Oh, dead, great, that's just great. Get away, get away from me. You guys give off one hell of a chill, you know that? The two of you. Sorry. Do you remember me, Marty? You were in my dream. I forget your name and the details. I'm Lilly. This little one here's Ruthie, but you wouldn't know her. Lilly, yeah. I think I'm remembering now. Yeah. Over at the Rose of Erin. Lilly, you had life enough in you for three people. I had some good times in that bar of yours. It's a long time ago, now. [Lilly singing] ♪ For it's no name, never ♪ No name never no more Yeah, I remember now. ♪ When I play People drank and sang together. -Then they stopped. ♪ No never no more They just stopped singing. Christ, it's coming back to me. Lilly, you had a daughter... and a jealous husband. A really jealous husband. Kathleen, I miss my little angel. He used to beat you, is that true? Tom Mally told me when I came back home for a visit once. We both saw you sitting alone in that back room. I never saw you again. They told me you'd gone. Christ, it was all so long ago. Now you're here, why? What's going on? We came with that chair. It's a part of us. It's difficult to explain. Been stored in dark places. Yeah, we both passed on in that chair. We bought the farm, checked out, stuffed the duck, kicked the can, bit the big one, cashed in our chips with the Grim Reaper. Get it? Yeah, I got it. We croaked, split, splatted. Okay, okay. Now, Marty, with you here, we'd like more than anything to go for a walk outside, so why don't you pick up the chair and let's go? What? What if I don't? What if I hack that chair up into pieces with a chainsaw? I never thought of that. I don't know. Do you think it matters if the chair's together or apart? Cut it to pieces if you like. Make it easier for us to go for walks with it anytime we want. But the chair was kind of like a gift, you know? We can pull it apart now and put it back together again later. We can wear pieces on our heads. [Ruthie laughing] Hi, Mrs. Cleary. [Ruthie laughing] I'll explain to you what I know of Ruthie's story, if you like. No, no, no, let me guess. She's the spawn of the Devil. [Ruthie laughing] [Ruthie] Yippie. [laughing] You see, this chair we've got, she died in it long ago. Her family ran a milliner's shop on Mabel road. They did embroidery for rich folks. They came from some other country I don't recall. Some place where they talk strange and drink thick coffee and wear bandanas on their heads. Bananas on their head? Anyway, she died of a fever. Years later I spied the chair in a Jumble shop and bought it, not knowing she was locked up in it somehow. She was alone a terrible long time and then I died and here we are. Does that make any sense? No, not really. Oh, my God, what am I seeing? You're seeing as I do, Marty. As a ghost does. As a ghost does. There's the guys from the Harry's Sign Works. Oh, my God, there's my Aunt Opal. Tom. It's Tom Mally. Oh, Jesus, Tom. I feel sick. It's hard enough thinking about... or even being reminded of these folks, without having to see them. [melancholic music] I had a dream like this once. In fact, a number of times. About all the people I've lost. It figures you would. But in my dream, the bodies of the dead were all stacked up like cords of firewood, stacked quayside by the cranes on the docks, on the steps of churches. That could be true as well, Marty. I have no idea. There goes Cap. Dolan and Mr. Zabbo, old drinking pals of my dad's. Used to be one of my dad's favorite drinking places. Wait a minute. Wow, it's my father. Dead as the others, huh? [faint blues music] ♪ Old Danny Boy ♪ The pipes, The pipes are calling ♪ What is this? Heaven? [distant boat horn honking] Where are you, guys? [seductive jazz music] Hey, there's Marty out there. What the hell is he doing? Help me out, I can't see you. Yeah, that's the bee-bop dude, all right. That looks like a piece of the chair I give him. What, did he break it already? Is he nuts? Hey, it looks like he's off his rocker. Holy shit. Jesus, you scared the hell out of me. Sheila, hello. You okay, man? You look awful. Come on, let me buy you a drink. No, no, I don't want a drink. I got to get these pieces home. I got to get home. I'll help you. You will? You'll walk with me a bit? I'm feeling kind of.. Out to lunch. Yeah, you do look a little discombobulated. What the hell have you done to my present? [kid] Hey Marty, I see you finally got yourself a girlfriend. Good for you, man. Hey Marty, where'd you find those shoes? How far did you have to chase a nigger to get those shoes? This town's full of assholes. What am I doing here? You're a couple of assholes, you know that? [both] Oh, yeah? [Marty] Yeah. Come on, Marty. Come on let's get out of here. These are the pieces of that chair you gave me. Yeah, I noticed. It was a nice chair, thanks. I guess. Are you okay, man? You're breaking my heart, you look so low. I've seen ghosts, Sheila. Two of them. Spirits as real as you or me. Around here, some place. Aw man, I saw a lot of dead people. At least, I think I did. Let me get you a drink. You got anything to drink around here? Drink, yeah. Over there. So... So, what? So what about the chair? And the whatevers? I don't believe in ghosts, or UFOs, or voodoo, or any of that kind of crap. Why don't you describe to me exactly what happened? I don't know what happened. I guess I must have just crossed the line... to the other side. [ominous music] Holy shit, what was that? [Ruthie laughing] [Sheila] I don't like this. Cut it out, Marty. [Marty] It's the spooks. They came with the chair. I'm getting out of here. [dog whining] Sheila, where exactly did you get that chair? I'm sorry, Marty. I just wanted to give you a present, all right? I don't understand, what do the ghosts have to do with the chair? Well, they did explain it to me, but I didn't completely get it. They talked to you? You drink all that gin in one gulp, you'll puke. No, I won't, give me a break, okay. Did we really just see what we just saw? -I guess so, yeah. -You're not scared shitless? I am and I'm not. -What am I going to do? -I don't know, I got no idea. Will they come up to my place or stay mostly down here with you? How should I know that? They only just relocated. How do we know they won't hurt us? How big do they get? One is a woman and the other one's a little girl. Yeah, I know that. [soft piano music] Now what do we do? Mister and lady, come inside. Lilly's playing.

Asshole Frank? Yeah. Asshole Frank. But she's beautiful. What was she doing with a bonehead like Frank? You know her from before, when she was living? Oh, yeah. Years ago, I used to drink at the Rose of Erin. She waited table there. We became friends. I used to drink, we used to talk. Then I went away. My dad wanted me to work on the boats but I said, "No way." I went to Frisco for a while, hung out, played the clubs, tried to make a living. A couple years later, I came back and Lilly was completely different. She wasn't even talking. Frank used to beat her up. Slammed her head once too often. I can believe that. Bastard. This is really fucking up my head. Take it easy. I don't know-- [sighs] I don't know if-- Marty. Marty. Hello, you there? I got to go. Oh, shit. It's alright, don't be frightened. My name's Lilly, this is Ruthie, we won't hurt you. Okay, just hold back. Don't come any closer. Do we make you feel cold? Should we move back a little? I don't feel cold, I feel nuts and scared. You're doing fine. You're taking all this well. I guess girls don't feel cold. You know, Sheila, there's so much I want to know about our bar. I heard men in the back lot saying the most amazing things. It's true he doesn't have Irish music no more on weekends, isn't it? No, I'm afraid not, not by a long shot. Stay awhile, talk. You can sit here, lady. [snoring] [faint Irish folk music] Lilly could I see you? Do you think that you could maybe... see me as your lover some day? Please, what? I like this idea. What? How did you-- What are you talking about? You and Sheila. I like the idea. [Sheila] Listen Marty, Lilly and I been talking. We got to get this chair back to the bar and we better hurry because I should have been back at work a long time ago. Don't worry. At least, I guess don't worry. What have I got to worry about? Everybody we're hanging out with is dead. Wait, I don't want to go in there and see that bastard. Well, I got no choice. I've got to go in. It's up to you. It'd be a big help to Lilly and to me. Sheila, where the hell have you been? I had a personal errand, sorry. I had to help someone. What the hell's that chair doing there? I wanted it gone. I'm taking it to be repaired by a friend of Marty's. What do you want, pal? Marty, is it? Want a beer? Yeah and a glass. All right. I haven't been in here in a long time. Yeah, last time was right after Jack's wake. -You're his son, aren't you? -Yeah. You got a good memory. I admired your old man. He was the last of a dying breed. That old rascal was a drinker and a stinker, yep? Yep. You know, one thing I liked about Jack, no one ever made him do anything he didn't want to do. He didn't take any shit from anybody. Not from his boss, not his wife. You know what he told me once? He said, "The only thing I never cheated on, was my taxes". [laughs] He never made enough money to pay his taxes. Fucking bum. [man] I feel kind of a cold breeze. It's the wind whistling through your ears. Hey Frank, I'm still waiting for that Singapore Sling. You know your old man was as Irish as Paddy's pig. How come you look so much like a Dago? Say Frank, I was remembering something the other day. I remembered your wife. Yeah, Lilly, I don't talk about her much anymore. Your wife? Excuse me for asking, Frank, but what exactly happened to her? Lilly was sick for a long time. I did everything a man could do to help her. She's been dead 15 years. You know, she left me alone with this place. They were hard times. I'm trying to make a better life for myself now. [seductive jazz music] Sheila get your ass up here. You were supposed to start an hour ago That rotten, conniving, weak minded bastard. Always accusing me of cheating. Look at this place. It looks like a bleeding whore house. You miserable old gobshite! You low life, spineless, murdering son-of-a-bitch. Who threw that glass? Who threw that glass? Where's the glass I gave you? I don't know, maybe I left it some place, on the bar maybe. Yeah, I left it on the bar, see? Somebody threw a god damn glass. And it came from this table, cause I saw it. There ain't nobody here except you, asshole. Nobody threw a glass, Frank. The glass fell off the shelf, hit the thing there and broke. Shut the fuck up. Get up you creep. -I didn't throw anything, man. -Come on. -You're begging for trouble. -Oh, yeah? Get over yourself, Frank. I saw him, nobody threw a glass. [music builds dramatically] What the hell is going on? Get away from my money! [cash register ringing] Get off! Get back here, god damn it! [screaming] [music cuts out] Marty, get us out of this place now. Please, get us back to the shed. Sure, I'll try! Ruthie, that's enough. Calm down now. Come with us. Jesus, what's the matter with her? She looks awful. Ruthie, what's happening to Lilly? You guys have to help us. You have to help Lilly, okay? What should we do? I'm supposed to take care of Lilly and you're supposed to help us. Okay, sure. I was hiding from dead ghosts, you see. I was all curled up like a little ball. I was over there. And over here is where he killed Lilly. That big guy Frank, he just smashed in here one day from inside the bar. Lilly was just sitting. She was just sitting and rocking. So then, he picked her up and he just.. hit her. Bam! And he hit her again. And she fell down, there. She hit her head. She was making big things of blood from her head. And she pulled herself up on the chair... and then she was quiet and dead. Sitting there. You saw this happen? Yeah, I was here with the chair. You were with the chair? Yeah, my chair. Now Lilly's my friend. Hey, what'd you do that for? Frank can see the light in here and come and find us. We should call the police. No, not the cops yet. They'll not believe you. It was too long ago. You know Frank reminds me of a sadistic gym teacher who used to pick on me and Eddie in fifth grade. What? I always wanted to squash that fucker. You see that bitch, Sheila, you tell her to stay out of my way. Tell her to come and pick up her things because she's out of here. She thinks everything's so fucking funny. Tonight was her fault. I can feel that. Yes, sure I will, Frank. See you later. [engine revving] What an asshole. It's open. [ominous music] What took you guys so long? [Lilly] I'm certain there's an old wood stove vent in the wall behind these boxes. He was fond of hiding cash here. Shit. I can't feel a thing up here. Oh, god damn it. I'm gonna choke on this shit. You should feel a cord or a hunk of twine. Keep going. [coughing] Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wow, fucking look at that. Leave it to Frank, always crying broke. Hasn't paid me for weeks, the murdering slob. [all laughing excitedly] [ominous music] [phone ringing] Yeah, what do you want? Yeah, Frank, are you far away? I hear strange noises coming from the bar. Well, you locked up, goddamn it. No, you locked up, Frank. And the lights, they're on. Hey man, do you want me to go get the cops? Fuck. [car horns honking] What's going on in here? Hold it! Stop whatever the fuck you're doing. What the fuck are you doing here, Sheila? What the fuck-- My money, my money! You're after my fuck-- Get up against the fucking wall. How did you know? How did you fucking know? I ought to shoot the both of you. You been watching me. [Lilly] Frank, give them the money. It goes to Kathleen. [ominous music] Lilly? Marty, Sheila, leave us alone, please. You want a drink or something? [Frank] Sheila, Sheila! This is going to be fun. [rapid footsteps] You. Mother fucker. You fucking cunt. I should fucking shoot you. Come here, okay, Mr. Marty? Come here and sit with me, okay? It's okay. [gunshot] You want to calm down, Frank. Try and center yourself. Hey, think about a waterfall. Shut the fuck up, goddamn it. Get out. Get out! Come here. Sell peanuts, sell peanuts, sell peanuts! Sheila, Marty, take the chair and go quick. I'll meet you. [distant sirens wailing] [Frank] Goddamn it. Well, we had a great time, >huh? Now it's time to scram. We got to take this car. We do? Really? Okay. [man grunting] -What's up? [Marty] It's okay, sport. We're just going to borrow the car then we'll take you home, there's no problem. [engine starting] Let's go. Have you lost your goddamn mind, Frank? What's gotten into you here? Lilly's here. She got the money. -She's back. -She's dead, Frank. No, I thought I killed her, but she's-- -What? -Nothing. -What? -Nothing. [Lilly] Aw, that was just grand. Well done, fellows, well done. I lived under the fist of that monster for 10 years. Why, I'll never know. Mostly to protect Kathleen. I wonder, where does she live now? It's only a chance but I once heard two old geezers mention she married a boy from the South side. Name Mayarosh, Steven Mayarosh. I'll call telephone information, see if they listed. Yeah, it's worth a try. I want you and Sheila to take half that money for yourselves. No, no, I couldn't do that. Well, you better do it, or I'll haunt you for the rest of your days. You would? Yeah, but not as I am now. I'd be a frail, sickly thing with a screechy voice. A spook that never got her own way. There's a Senior and a Junior. Must be the Junior, right? [Irish folk music] Want us to put the money in the mailbox? This is fine. Now you go. Go on. Thank you very much. My pleasure. What if they went to the wrong place? I can't move my neck too good. Jesus, what's the matter? Don't you like to be touched? What? No, no it's not that. It's been a long time. Well, how long? Months, a couple of months? A year? A long time. [Irish folk music] Well, I guess we better go home, unless you want to fly straight to Vegas and spend this money. I don't know. I'm really tired. You know for once, I'm not. I don't ever want to go back to my place again. Well, take me to my place then. Big difference. You haven't been there since I fixed it up. It's clean. There's flowers and food and fresh sheets. When was the last time you slept between fresh sheets? A long time. ["The Rose of Erin" by Joe Strummer] [upbeat country music]
