MAN: I was looking for you, not these characters. You stoolie? Wait a minute, who let you in? WIDMARK: (ON-SCREEN) Hey, pal, what's on your mind? Hey, pal, what's on your mind? MAN: I've gotta square myself with you, Tommy. TOMMY: There's nothing to square. You're my pal. There's nothing to square. You're my pal. You're smart, too. (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) Hey! Knock it off, will you? At least he's getting paid for it. (KNIFE CLICKS) Oh... (CHUCKLES) You're a big man. A big man... A big man with a big mouth! You know what I do with big men? I carve 'em up like turkeys. Big, fat turkeys. Look, I didn't mean anything. Yeah, you... I was only trying to watch the movie. You're a broken-down valise. Hey, Joe, your brother's outside. Yeah, yeah. Watch your mouth, punk. Or somebody's gonna close it for good one of these days. I'm sorry, please... Come on, Joe. Please. Yeah, yeah, I'm with you, Mannie. I'm with you. You fooled me and that takes a big man. Come on, Joe. MAN: Yeah, what are you gonna do about it? TOMMY: I ain't gonna do nothing. (EXHALES) JOE: Hey, you've been shopping, Jelly? JELLY: Yeah, terrific stuff. Hey... Nice, huh? You like the color? Yeah. Now, the accessories... Special on sale, terrific bargains. .45, P-38 and two snub noses. (OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO) (OPERA SINGER SINGS IN ITALIAN) (ALL SINGING ALONG) (MUSIC CONTINUES) (CONTINUES SINGING IN ITALIAN) RICHIE: Mannie, get on the wheel and wait for us in that alley. Jelly, hit the door. (TIRES SCREECHING) If we don't come out right away, come in fast. JOE: Let's go. (MUSIC PLAYING) (GUNSHOTS) (WOMAN SCREAMING) (GLASS SHATTERS) How do you like that? Here he is, laughing, eatin', commits suicide. That's the way I like 'em. Just like butter. Sounds like a lot of shooting in there. JOE: Hey, the poor bastard. RICHIE: Poor bastard? Hell! The son of a bitch's been squealing on all of us to the D.A. for over a year. (PRIEST RECITING PRAYERS IN LATIN) (PRIEST CONTINUES IN LATIN) MELFI: You can go. You can go. JOE: That's it? That's all? That's all. And, boys, it's Sunday! Hey, what is this? We just do a job for the old man and we're not good enough to come into his house? You tell your boss, Mr. Falco... Hey, he is your boss, too. Have respect. Hey, this is what I respect. Right. Cut it, Joe. Hey, what do you think you got here, some citrul? Cut it. All right. The words my brother uses are wrong, but what he says is right. Now, please tell Mr. Falco, the risks we take are big, and the pay has always been small. Si. Si. (CAR DOOR SHUTS) (MUSIC PLAYING) They did a good job. Clean. Send something to the poor man's widow. Va bene. Hmm, people are never prepared. Yeah. What else? They want a part of the numbers operation as payment. But they've only done their duty, no? You see? (CHUCKLES) See? See how the world is? You see the greed, huh? JOE: Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. What's that? Go on! Go on! Angelina, ask your brother here. BOY 1: Joe, do Bogart. Hey! What are you doing? Go on, go on, get outta here! BOY 1: Do Bogart. BOY 2: Ah, come on! Ain't you got anything better to do? BOY 1: Please. Please. All right, all right. (IMITATES BOGART) Listen, sweetheart, this is my territory. I don't want no trouble, or you're gonna get wasted, see? Now, Widmark, Joe. Yeah, yeah, Widmark. All right, all right. (CHUCKLING) Big man, big man... You know what I do to squealers? I get them in the belly! Ah! (ALL LAUGHING) All right, all right. Hey, Tonto! What's happening, kemosabe? (GIGGLING) Hey, you see any cavalry out there? Me see no pale-faces. Is that right, kemosabe? Hey, you got somethin' in your ear here. Hey! Hey! JOE: Oh... (CHUCKLING) (CHEERING) (BANGING DOOR) (INDISTINCT TALKING) Hey, I wanna see $35 in this machine this week or I'm gonna break your fingers. One by one. Hey, this ain't my machine! (CHILDREN TALK EXCITEDLY) (HORN HONKING) Go tell Vince and my brother we've got visitors. Jelly? $400? $100 a piece? Service to the famiglia is a duty. (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Hey, that guinea stuff don't pay the rent! The old man gets 50% of our action, plus dues, plus calls for service. Here's what we get? This? That son of a bitch! Don't talk that way. Yeah? Who's gonna stop me, these salamis here? Mr. Falco's got action all over town. Books, numbers, broads, swag. We're getting screwed. That's enough, Joe. Tell Mr. Falco to consider our service as a gift. We appreciate everything he's done for us. He'll be glad to hear these words. Ciao. JOE: I don't know how much longer I can go on takin' it! Well, maybe you don't have to. Now, what you mean? You gonna move against them? I'm tired of being a slave. I've spent 15 years a good soldier, and where did it get me? It got me white hairs, it got me pains in my gut. Ha! Yeah. We're gonna make our move? Yeah! You're crazy! (LAUGHING) Yeow! (LAUGHING) That's what I've been wanting to hear. We're gonna have every family of New York on us. Come on, you just don't go against the boss. Hey, bullshit. How'd Luciano get to be boss? By chopping Masseria. Genovese pushes Costello, he's the boss. Then Anastasia gets hit. It's time these old greaseballs moved over and gave us some room. You wanna spend the rest of your life at $100 a hit? The old man's got too much power. You just have to count me out. But how could we count you out? You're number two man here. Because I said so, that's how! Suicide's against my religion. Look, I got my wife and kids. Jelly? Hey, I got no kids. Yeah, I think it's time we pushed these old greasers. Cheech? Okay, we can't force you. For Chrissake. Look, see this man? How many times did he cover your back? How many times he take your lumps? You remember that. You put yourself out of circulation, Vince, for a while. We pull this off, maybe things are different. Look, I'm sorry. It's okay. Take care. You're gonna regret that. You wanna hit him? Jelly? Na! That's the way it is. We're stuck with it. Let's go. (GUNSHOTS) JOE: Hey, Cheech! I'll go around, you get 'em! (GUNSHOTS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (GUNSHOTS CONTINUE) Hey, it's just like the Fourth of July!

(CAR ENGINE WHIRRING IN DISTANCE) (TIRES SCREECHING) (CAR DOORS OPENING AND CLOSING) (CLATTERING) JOE: Ah, welcome to the party! The big underboss and the old man's favorite brother. Bravo, Richie! Hey, fat man, you wanna try this on for size? Come on, Joe. Hey, look, look. We got you the luxury model. Ain't that nice? Nice pillow. (CHUCKLES) Nice, huh? Hey, look at that. Very fancy! Go ahead, see if it fits. (GRUNTING) Oop, oop, oop. Relax now, relax. Here, how you feel now, huh? How does that feel, huh? There's your coffin. Now you see him, now you don't. (JOE CHUCKLING) You know what I'm gonna do? We're gonna nail down the top and send it to Mr. Falco... Hey, that's enough. Hey. Hey! (MELFI STRUGGLING) What do you want? (STRUGGLING) What is it? What? (STRUGGLING) What is it? (GASPING) Pill. Pill. Here. How many? (PANTING) JOE: What's this? Hey, look at that. He pissed himself. (ALL LAUGHING) JOE: A man of respect. You make me want to throw up. (BIRDS SQUAWKING) If you hurt those men, I tell you, all will be lost. They're all right. For now. But if anybody moves against us, Jelly's got orders to finish 'em. What you've done is very bad. I will talk to the Commission. The Capi famiglia will call you. In the meantime, watch what you do and how you speak. You watch your mouth. Okay, okay. Richie! Joe! RICHIE: Don Vittorio, I think we're gonna need a little help in there. (SPEAKING IN ITALIAN) Such bad boys! (DON VITTORIO SPEAKING ITALIAN) Buongiorno, Don Ettore. (SHIP HORN BLOWS) This friendship between DeMarco, Falco and your friend Vince Coletti... Very interesting. So this is how you stay out of it, huh, Vince? Don't start. You got a little promotion, huh? Joe, Rich. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) You... (SCOFFS) If I find myself in this room, it is only out of respect for the authority of this Commission. And it is only out of respect for that authority, also, that I have held back my hand from the punishment these two deserve. Excuse me, excuse me. We've come here to discuss, not to threaten. We're looking for an understanding. Va bene. If we allow ourselves to bargain with these... ...malacarni... To make deals with them, the soldiers of every family will hear of it, no? And what then? What will happen then to our authority, our families? What? We will be at the mercy of every young pazzo! No? So, this is the question we must answer here, now. I have nothing more to say. Richie? A father has the respect of his children when he loves them and takes care of them. We don't question the authority of Mr. Falco. That ain't the problem. The problem is, we've been good soldiers. We've performed many services and we have not been taken care of. We must have a better share of things. The books, the numbers. We're reasonable men. None of Mr. Falco's people have been hurt. We took them to bring this problem to your attention. We'll honor your decision. (INAUDIBLE) The rule is we don't come between a boss and his family. This is something you must decide among yourselves. But... But first, we say, you must let those that you've taken, go free. And then negotiate among yourselves, in good faith, what is fair. You agree? You? All right. That's all. Thank you, Don Vittorio. I don't get it. We're right back where we started. No, figlio mio... Now you know, the families will keep out of it. Suppose the old man doesn't negotiate? As soon as you release those people, you're free to deal with this problem as you like. Capisce? (SPEAKS ITALIAN) That's it, Richie, we're on our way! RICHIE: Like Don Vittorio said, we want a meeting this week. We negotiate in good faith. (ENGINE STARTING) (TIRES SCREECHING) All right, get to the back. (CAR DOOR CLOSING) Cheech, right here.

I don't know. It's... It's respect. It's for people to know that I'm something. Oh, you're something to me. That ain't enough, Anne. There, out there, they gotta know! Big man, big man, huh?

Dottore, be so good. Give us a few minutes. Certainly. Well, come on, come on. Richie and Joe need money bad. Joe's on the street, to sell a load of hijacked booze. Hmm. Well, you know what to do. Pass the word. Let someone buy from him. (SIGHS HEAVILY) Carlu... Carluccio, Carluccio. Doctor. Carluccio. (GROANING) Ah! Giovanni. Anybody wants in, you tell 'em we're closed. Okay, Joe.

I'm offering you $40,000 worth of first-class merchandise, and you say you can't? It ain't the price. If Falco finds out I'm buying from you, I'm finished. Joe, you know if I could I would. Look, Vick. I don't think you understand the bargain you're gettin' here. Hey, Vick, gimme a hand. VICK: I can't. Honest. Vick, look at it this way, you're buying more than booze here. What do you mean? Vick, this is a funny city, you know. With all the construction goin' on, you're walking down the street, a brick falls on your head, you're dead. And the traffic is terrible. (OVER RADIO) I mean, you step off the curb, a car hits you, you're also dead. I can't, Joe. Honest to God! Look, Vick, gimme a hand. Because if you don't give me a hand, I'll take an arm! (GROANS AND SCREAMS) All right, Joe. Freeze, police! Go ahead, try it! (CHUCKLES) Hey, I'll be a son of a bitch. Okay, baby! Well, that should put Joey on ice for a while. It shouldn't have been done this way. Cheer up, Vincenzo, we could have blown his head off. JUDGE: You stand convicted of assault and extortion. It is the decision of this court that you be committed to a state prison for a period of 10 years on the first charge, and a period of not less than seven years, six months, nor more than 15 years on the second charge. These sentences are to run concurrently. (GAVEL POUNDING) Remand him to the Department of Correction. BAILIFF: All rise. Joe. Come on, now. Joe. Come on, now, look... Look, I'm gonna be gone a long time now. No, no. Look, you will just find somebody else, huh? No! Ah, come on, come on! Don't do that! I'm just not gonna be here. I love you. Come on, now. I love you so. Come on, now, you promise? (SOBS) I love you. Hey, Richie? You talk to her, huh? (SOBBING) REPORTER: Joe, do you think you were set up? No comment. When you were hiding, Joe, you ever think your enemies would nail you? Are you kiddin'? There's my bodyguard. You think anybody would make a move against me with him around? (ALL LAUGHING) Now the government can't touch nothing. These are my little chickens. Now they are all provided. Frank. Giovanni, you're the boss now. Nunzio, Frank, you help him now, eh? Listen, you gotta be careful. You know that with me gone, Don Vittorio will try to swallow up the family. The only one who can help you is DeMarco here. He's the only one who has the courage to go against Don Vittorio. Frank. Yes. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Why me, Mr. DeMarco? Well, you haven't exposed yourself too much, and you know Don Vittorio. You can get close to him with no problems. And because you did the right thing when Joe and Richie went against us. I thought it was all over. I thought there'd be no more trouble. Listen, Vince... Mr. Melfi, he needs a consigliere. But you gonna have to show the rest of the family you're worthy of this position. Don Vittorio grows stronger every day. And he has about 400 soldiers. Don Vittorio'll eat us alive if we don't move. This is a big chance for you. Bravo! Bravo lo consigliere! (DOOR BELL CHIMING) Don Vittorio? Hold it! No, no, no, no. You don't have to do that. Not with him, he's a good man. (CHUCKLES) How are you, Vincenzino? Fine, Don Vittorio. Take coffee? Please. Coffee, Angelo. Yes, sir. Come on, come in. Make yourself comfortable. Take your coat off. Go ahead, sit down. Sit, sit. Ah, now, what's so important? What's the trouble? Who? Melfi and DeMarco. (LASHING) MELFI: I don't know. Maybe you don't hear good. Where's DeMarco hiding out? I told you, I don't know. Honest to God! See that machine, huh? It chops up food for my chickens. Makes little pieces outta big ones. It's gonna chop you up in a minute, fat man. (MACHINERY WHIRRING) Believe me! Please! I had to go in with DeMarco. I didn't want to do it, but... CHARLIE: Hey! Look again. Shut it off! So? Please! Pieta! Pieta! Hey! Hey! He's about finished. I think it's the heart. Good. We don't have to do nothing, then. Take him home while he's still warm. Va bene? One, two, three, four... All right. Go. Allora, Vincenzino. You've done a good thing there. The Falco family will go to you soon. Maybe some of them don't like you as a boss so young. I'll talk to the Commission about it. You will have power and responsibility, too. But first, talk to Richie. These wars have hurt us. And they've got to stop. Joe and Richie will never accept me as boss. You try. Give them a bigger cut of the operations. Do what you have to do to restore order. D'accordo? And you're my man now, uh? JOE: They made him boss? That bust out punk? RICHIE: Not they. Don Vittorio. I thought they were supposed to be equal. Yeah, but now he's the first among the equals. Vince, the head of the Falco family. Joey... Joey, he wants to make a deal with us. Deal hell! We're already losing the soldiers to him. If I don't make some kind of truce, there won't be nothing left when you get out. Then we'll start over, that ball-busting son of a bitch. Joey, I'm tired. I can't hold it together anymore. There's too much war and too many guys knocked off. I can't go against Don Vittorio. I ain't got the soldiers or the money. Then let it go, Richie. Just like that? Just like that. You've seen Anne? Er, last month. She, uh... She's getting married. She wrote me. Well, it's only right. I've been in here three years. I brought you some books. You got some time to improve your mind. What mind? (CHUCKLES) (CHUCKLES) Hey, you still got that stomach thing? Yeah. I told you you was gonna get ulcers. You look lousy. Yeah, I know. Look, if you need the bread, go ahead. Go ahead, make a deal with Vince. No, no... No, Joey, I don't need money anymore. I don't need anything. I... I'm just trying to hold this thing of ours together for you. Well, what's the difference? It's all just opera. (BUZZER SOUNDING) Well, take care of yourself, kid. Hey, wait! What's you mean, you don't need? Richie! Richie! Richie! Richie! (RADIO PLAYING) JOE: "Mankind's destiny is an effort to regain paradise. "But in between, man is at war with himself. "With his primitive aggression, "man has only two alternatives. "To turn the aggression outward and destroy others. "The other is to turn the aggression inward "and destroy himself." Yeah, Richie. MAN: Well, what's the name of this cat? JOE: Camus. He's a famous French writer. He's what they call an Existentialist. A what? Existentialism. It's a philosophy, a way of life. It says you live free of the rules, you make up your own, but you gotta be willing to pay the tab for it. Yeah? Kinda like us, huh? Yeah. You mean all this time all that stuff I've been doin' has got a fancy name like that? (LAUGHS) Man, I'm comin' up in the world! What's it called, ex... (STAMMERS) Existentialism. Listen, this is Caligula, a big time Roman Emperor. He says, "The world has no importance. "Once a man realizes that, he wins his freedom." Now, that's one of the main points of the philosophy. No shit. Ah, you dumb-dumb. This is what you ought to be getting your head into. See, that's the trouble with you people. You spend too much time on your animal instincts instead of developing your mind. Yeah, well, when you in the jungle, baby, I figure it's your instincts that count. The jungle is right! Hey, bwana, I guess I carry your gun. (ALL LAUGHING) MAN: If anybody wants haircuts, now is the time for C Block. Hey, you better go. You're already looking like some Mau-Mau. (ALL LAUGHING) Don't talk, hippie. Okay, that's me. The Italian hippie. (ALL LAUGHING) NEWS REPORTER: ...demonstrators since the arrest last night of Vince Coletti's brother. Coletti is an alleged head of a powerful Brooklyn crime family, once bossed by Stefano Falco. Since last night... How are you, Cosmo, how's it going? Not bad, Joey. Hey, Joey, your pal's on TV. Led by Coletti, this gathering has all the markings of a full-scale confrontation. Mr. Coletti, is there any... Hey, what's he think he's doing? What? Are you kiddin'? Listen, anything I've done, I'm willing to pick up the tab for it, but my kid brother's innocent. These people can't pin anything on me, so they take it out on my family. So, are you saying your bother's been framed? You're goddamn right. They've been steppin' on Italians long enough and we're sick of it. Hey, Joey, is that the Italian power? Look, look at him! It's time we defended ourselves. It's time we Italians got organized. (ALL LAUGHING) Okay, Joe, you're next. Hey, take Willy. I wanna watch this guy. The hell I am. I ain't gonna cut no nigger's hair. The black barber's gonna be back. (TV PLAYING) You what? Come on, say it again! Come on, say it again, mother! I said I ain't gonna cut any black nigger's hair! You son of a bitch! No, let me have him, Joe. You touch this bastard, they'll put you on the cross. Now listen, you bastard, if you're not gonna cut his hair, you bastard, or I'm gonna cut your throat. Put it down, Joey. Make me, screw.

You want ice? No, no. Straight, thank you. So? So I'm saying that we organize, form a movement. We call it the Italo-American Federation. We set up a rally. You going into politics? Sit down. (CHUCKLES) Well, that's what it all is now! Uh, public relations, TV image, Don Vittorio. We have to go modern. Use modern business techniques. We have to create an image for ourselves. We get enough Italians together, uh, give them a cause, anti-defamation, discrimination... And you won't hear the words Mafia and Cosa Nostra anymore. You won't even read them in the papers. Instead, we use civil rights, the Constitution, stuff like that. And I am telling you, we'll have everybody that wears a badge, from a dog catcher on up, walking on eggs. I don't think it can work, Vincenzo. It can't miss! In 12 hours we had over 200 people in front of the federal building. Thousands have pledged their contributions. Just let me... Just, just, just a minute. These people, they make big contributions? They pay dues and they make contributions. Look, just let me set up the rally. Okay. We try. You can have the... The longshoremen. That's a good foundation. We'll give them a day off. That's exactly what I'm talkin' about. I tell you something. Vincenzino. It don't feel right to me. But it's something new, so... So we give it a try. If it don't work, you take the weight of it, you understand? Listen, don't worry. I know what I'm doing. I hope so, figlio mio. I hope so.

I haven't got time for games, Joe. If they don't come out, there's gonna be a lot of dying around here. You've got a chance to stop it. What do they want? I don't know. I don't even think they know. What do you say? (MEN CLAMORING) Willy, Warden says I can come up alone. Hold it! Hold it! What do you say, Willy? It's no jive. The Warden says I can come up alone. Let's talk. All right, hippie. Come on up. We don't want no speeches, Joe. We want action! You got that, everyone? We want action! (PRISONERS CLAMORING) If you try some tricks, motherfucker, you're gonna go with these bastards. No tricks. Spread. He's clean, Willy. Hey, Willy, let's talk. Maybe we can pull this thing off. You know me, brother. I'm for peace. JOE: Yeah, a piece of ass. (MEN LAUGHING) You're off your nut, you know. You're getting out of here in two weeks, you know? Okay, what's your deal? Well, you tell me. You got the aces. Yeah, in spades, baby, in spades! (ALL LAUGHING) That takes care of number 10. 11, let's see. Recreation room open an extra hour after supper, laundry every other day, segregation in the movies or any other activities stopped. Agreed? And this, er, last point here like Joe says. No, uh, no recriminations or punishments of any form for the above-mentioned demonstration. We start clean. I get out when I'm supposed to, right? Your signature, Warden. (PRISONERS SHOUTING) You're a big man, huh, Joe? A real big man. I find that when you're really a big man, you don't have to say it about yourself. Others say it for you. Just like you have, Warden. (BAND PLAYING) (INAUDIBLE) (CROWD CHEERING) And now, the man who's made all this possible for you, for all of us, Mr. Vincent Coletti. (ALL CHEERING) Thank you, Mr. Congressman. I have a few statistics here. The TV people tell me they estimate there are about 50,000 of us here today. (DRUM ROLL) (ALL CHEERING) Now, you hear a lot of talk about the Mafia. I mean, is that Italian kid Mafia? ALL: No! Is this beautiful girl? ALL: No! VINCENT: The Mafia, what is that? I'll tell you. It's a word that big business uses to sell newspapers and movies. I mean, I've been around Italians all my life and I still don't know what it is. (ALL CHEERING) We're gonna take that word out of the dictionary. I tell you, we got enough of being kicked around like second-class citizens. And from now on, we're gonna start to do some kicking of our own. (ALL CHEERING) (INAUDIBLE) (CROWD CHEERING) (CROWD CHEERING) But I tell you this... There's a conspiracy in this country against me, against all Italians. And I tell you this. I think this conspiracy goes all the way to the President! But you and Vince Coletti are together today under God's eyes. And I promise you, those who get in our way will feel His sting! (CROWD CHEERING) What a show! Looks like a Mafia convention. They're coming out of the woodwork. Mafia? What's that? I don't know the word. (CAMERA CLICKS) So, Coletti wants to play games. He wants to make a public issue out of it. We'll give him publicity. He's not gonna be able to go to the toilet without us. (CAMERA CLICKS) By the time when the Grand Jury gets finished with this little picture gallery, he's gonna be sorry he ever started this little circus. (ALL CHEERING) Thirty-two. Well, Joe... Looks like I'm off to bigger and better things. JOE: You know what the trouble with you is? You're a product of Capitalist racist exploitation, which makes you an incorrigible sociological liability. (WILL LAUGHS) Yeah, hey, I know just what you mean, man. My mammy used to say that to me all the time. (WILLY LAUGHS) Joe, listen, I wasn't kidding, man. I can put some pretty good people together, handle any kind of heavy work. Now, if you haven't changed your mind by the time you get out, and you wanna make your move, I'm with you. Well, you better think about it. Because if I make my move and you're with me, you're gonna be up against all the New York families. And how's it gonna look to your own people doing business with the Ofays? It will look just fine, as long as they get their share of the pie. Joe, I ain't kidding, man. Between us, we could move a lot of action. Well, maybe so. You just take care you don't fall on your ass, you hear? (LAUGHS) I'll see you, you damn Mau-Mau. Power. Power! No, Vincenzino, you... You make big trouble here. Between the FBI and the police, we can't even make a move. No. The federation is finished. The experiment is over. Don Vittorio... Vincenzino, with all the money you made from this federation, you can't even give the right share to your boss? Do I have to tell you? Don Vittorio, you don't understand. It's not your money, because it's not my money. It belongs to the people who contributed to the federation for the fight against discrimination and, and for works of charity. If we pull out now, it's like admitting what we are to the whole world. The world knows what we are. Do you think you're fooling anybody? The judges, the police, the politicians who need our favors, they know what we are. It suits them. Why do you think they've all turned against us now? Because... Because we've drawn attention to ourselves. And when we draw attention to ourselves, we draw attention to them. No, you... You've upset the balance that makes this thing of ours work. Don Vittorio, I can't stop now. This thing's too big. People out there, they need me, they need the federation. We can do some good work here. We've got a hospital going, and a camp. Vince! You go back to running your business. We'll find somebody else clean to take over this federation thing. But you... You finish it. I tell you this for your own good. Don Vittorio... I can't. It'll all fall apart without me. Angelo? Arrivederci. Don Vittorio. Angelo? Yes? When does Joe get out? How you doin', Joe? What is this, the Coletti welcoming committee? Vince sends regards. He wants a talk. You tell him I got prisonitis, lock jaw, right now. I'll see him when I'm ready. Hiya, kid. Hey, Mau-Mau. (LAUGHS) Hippie-hippie, how you doin'? How you doin', man? You're looking good. Good to see you. Nice machine you got here. Oh, yeah, well, I'm up in the world now. Hey, hop on, man. I got some friends I want you to meet. No, I got some things I gotta do right now. Oh, yeah? What's her name? (LAUGHS) Nothing like that. Hey, look, man. I just, uh, rode out here to give you this number, so you could find me when you get out of town. Okay? Okay, I'll see you later. Right. Peanuts. And I mean peanuts. Juke boxes and a couple of protection operations, stuff like that. I mean, ever since Richie died, all of our action has been going to Vince. With Don Vittorio backing him, we couldn't hold on to it. I hear Vince got trouble from the old man on account of this Italian-American federation? Yeah. Him and all the bosses. Meanwhile, Don Vittorio wanted to see you. Ooh. (CHUCKLES) Don Vittorio? Excuse us, please. Joe! (CHUCKLES) How do you like 'em, huh? Eight years, you don't look a day older. Well, you know me, Don Vittorio. In or out, I take care of myself. Yeah, good, good, good. (CHUCKLES) You... You talked to Coletti, huh? Oh, no, you come first. Ah, Joe... Ah! The problems I have... This... Federation business, it's crazy. What do you want, Don Vittorio? You want me to waste Coletti for you? Joe! I... I want the federation finished. You got problems with Coletti. Close as he is to me, I don't mix in. You do like you want. Yeah. Seems to me like I heard that before. Right now, all I want to do is take what's mine back. If Coletti gets in the way, I'll do what I have to. You know? Capisce. But it's for me. Numero uno. Yeah, I understand. I... Right is right. Well, that's the way it seems to me, you know. From now on, things are gonna be different. Look around you. The world's changing. Every day there's surprises. Ciao. Eh! Ciao. Ah, Giuseppino, you're mistaken. The world doesn't change. Yeah. Okay. See you. Hey! Here he is at last. You look good, Joe. Yeah, the joint agrees with me. I got an office in the back. We can talk there. Yeah, I got no secrets. Hey, it's lunchtime. Come on! Take a break, everybody. Come. Ever see anything like this? Who could believe it, huh? Could you? Hey, Joe, here we are again in the old neighborhood. Get to it, Vince. Okay. I want you in with me. In how, Vinny? Well, together. We operate together like the old days. What's your offer? Oh, we can work out the details later. Ah, no. First... That's not the way you do business, paisa. Okay, suppose I throw a couple of grand on the table for openers? Listen, you son of a bitch. Look, Richie bled his guts out because of you, and you took eight years away from me. You copped out on us and what happened? You wound up with Falco. And now you're Don Vittorio's boy, but nothing's changed, he made you a boss. It doesn't matter. The only thing you ever did on your own was this foundation, and now the old man is taking it away from you. You're in Dutch, baby. That's what you say. You're wrong. You're wrong about everything. I owe you, Vinny. I owe you big. Me and Richie. You goin' against me, Joe? Maybe. (CHUCKLES) VINCENT: With what? We'll see. Hey, it's a big world out there, cumpa. We'll see. Girls, girls! Look, hot from Seventh Avenue! (CHUCKLES) How about this, Mannie, huh? Big business, high finance. How you like it, Mannie, huh? See anything you like? Anything at all? How about that, Mannie? How about that? God's gift to soul sisters. Come on, rub it. Hey, it might change your luck, brother. What's the matter? You scared, baby? Damn, that's some good smelling shit, J.D. J.D.: Straight from Thailand, baby. Nothing but the blossoms. Dynamite! (CHUCKLES) That's Sam, that's Lou, that's Art. And this here, that's Skeeter, baby! How you doin', Skeet? I'm flyin', baby. WILLY: So, how about it? Well, that, uh, all depends. Okay. From Wycoff Avenue to the docks, you get 25% of the take. Numbers, books, broads, drugs, shylocks, swag, everything. How about, uh, 30? Thirty? Okay. You sure you're not Jewish? (ALL LAUGH) All right. From the docks to Rockaway, you get 20%. On everything? Everything. Okay. When do we start? Yesterday. Yesterday it is! (BOTH CHUCKLE) All right! Boys, looks like we're goin' uptown! Yes, sir. We're in business. Tomorrow is here. Skeet. Yeah. You speak Italian? You speak Italian? Yeah, macaroni. (ALL LAUGHING) What do you want from me, my life? Don Vittorio says that my drivers don't get off. Those who do, when they come back, they find themselves out of a job. All right, I'll get the other locals. You won't! The word's out. Do yourself a favor, huh? Forget the rally. Why don't you go to hell! I ain't got enough troubles with that bastard Joe. The hell with these bums, who needs them? Hey, listen... Er, I can't be there tomorrow. What, you, too? No, it's not that. I got this lousy cough from smokin'. (COUGHING) I gotta get some X-rays taken. Honest. Huh, sure, Danny. Please, Vince. Don't do it. For God's sake! I gotta. Why? I don't know. It's like they said, it's my thing. MAN: Please! Please! Please! Please! Please, Joey, Joey. Coletti's people, they will kill me! Nobody is gonna touch you. You're under protection of the new management. First payment for services rendered. And we won't be closing Columbus Day. Seein's how we're starting out, we're gonna need the business. (BAND PLAYING) ANNOUNCER: And although the crowd here is less than half of what it was at the rally last year, the spirit and determination shown by the people present has not diminished one bit. Mr. Coletti has just arrived with his family and now makes his way towards the stand... (ALL CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) Mr. Coletti, Mr. Coletti. Will you hold it, a minute, please? (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (GUNSHOT) (CROWD SCREAMING) I repeat, Vincent Coletti has been shot. His condition is still not known. His attacker was also shot. The black did it. It's the niggers! MAN: It's the niggers! (CROWD CLAMORING) (SIRENS WAILING) (SIGHS) Too late. Can't help. There is no chance. Please, please! You son of a bitch! Come on, take it easy, huh? Take it easy! Have any idea who did it? No. What's gonna happen to the federation? We don't know. He was tryin' to do something good for these people. Something that nobody ever else did in this country. He has given us identity. I don't know what's gonna happen to it. You know anybody who can do what he did, huh? Please, please, please. REPORTER: When Vince Coletti was gunned down in front of thousands of his horrified followers, police agencies requested depositions from alleged mobsters of the five New York crime families as to their whereabouts and actions before and after the shooting. Vittorio Santoni, accompanied by his lawyer, is now entering the police station to make his deposition. Mr. Santoni is reputedly the most powerful New York City mobster, and by many, considered the boss of bosses. Please wait over there. Get your hands off me, you big ape. You think I am your little sister. COP: Hold it, baby, just calm down. WOMAN: Oh, screw you, too, buster. All right, now, take it easy. What's your name? WOMAN: Margo... (RADIO CHATTER) WOMAN: You have no right to arrest me. COP: Right. Oh, Mr. Santoni come with me. Joe. Oh, it's terrible. It's like someone hurt my own son. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) What a man, like a saint! Such good work he was doing in the name of all Italians. What's happening, Joe? How long we gonna have to stay here? Look, Annie... (KNOCKS ON DOOR) Yeah? WILLY: Willy. You real slick, ain't you? Motherfucker. You been jiving me right from the start! What the hell are you talking about? Hired yourself a little nigger boy to do your job, huh? You set him up! What's the matter? Too hairy for you or Mannie? Don't believe what you read in the papers, Willy. Yeah? You tell me different, huh. You run it down to me, brother! Well, I'm telling you different! I'm clean! It's that son of a bitch, Don Vittorio. In one move he nails all of us, me, Coletti, all of us. Bullshit! Come on, Willy, use your head. You know it's gotta be him. First he gets Vince, then he sets you and me, black and white, against each other. It's a perfect move for him. And you're falling for the scam like some dumb street punk. Come on, Willy. You know I'm levelin'. Why would I want to go against you? You and your people are my right arm! Joe, I'm tellin' you, man, don't be lying to me! You don't believe me, there's the door, brother. All right, what's our move? I've been thinkin' about that. Don Vittorio thinks he got us on the run. Well, he ain't. We're gonna use this thing. First we spread the word that Coletti was hit on our contract. That'd show the kind of muscle we got. Then we show ourselves, let people see us takin' over. We move everybody we got out in the street, and move 'em hard. Against Coletti's operations? (CHUCKLES) And Don Vittorio's, too. Are you crazy? You can't do that. It's too bad you two don't read a little history. You know, when I was in the slam, I read about a slave named Spartacus. He went against the whole Roman Empire and had them pissing. Now, Don Vittorio's flesh and blood, just like Coletti. It's time he found that out. What do you say, Willy? Okay, Joe, I'm with you. I'll be right out. (DOOR CLOSES) What's the matter? That was just something you said to him, wasn't it? You're not really going against Don Vittorio? Why not? You can't win. You know that. Annie, listen. I've got no other way to go now. I've got no choice. We could get out of here. Go away. Where? To what? To me, to each other. That ain't enough! I guess it's something you've been telling me all along. Please, Annie. Don't. Please, I need you. No, you don't. Look, try to understand, would you? I'm street meat. Me and Richie gettin' our heads busted for nickels and dimes, grabbing for a place of honor and never makin' it. I just can't touch it, Annie. It's just there in front of me and I can never make it. It's the only thing I know, it's the only way. Well, I'm somebody and I'm gonna show 'em. I got a chance now, Annie. It may be my last. I gotta go for broke this time. All the way! If I don't, what choice do I have? The street? I don't want to die in the street, Annie. Look, I'm not gonna talk you into nothing. I just want to say it straight. I love you. I need you. If it's gonna be like you say, maybe more than before. (RADIO PLAYING) Hey, lean it! Ooh-wee, Willy! That's gonna fill my little piggy bank. (CHUCKLES) My favorite color, next to black. (CHUCKLES) Good nigger. Hey, what's the matter with you? You people don't read the street signs too good. This is Don Vittorio's territory. Hey, Willy? Huh? This is one of Don Vittorio's new all-American boys. Hey, what's happenin', my man? Kiss my ass. What'd you say? You piece of... Hey! Hey, Willy, this guy wants to show some respect. Oh, yeah? Yeah, he wants to kiss your ass. Yeah. (LAUGHING) Well, I don't want to disappoint him. Here you are, my man, two big beautiful moons! Hey! JOE: Come on, show some respect. Joe. All right, kiss it. Come on, smart guy. Kiss it. Kiss it. Come on, kiss it! Come on! Listen, big man, it's your last chance. You want another hole in your ear? Get on with it. Joe. Shut up, Mannie. All right, smart guy. I said, "Kiss it." WILLY: Come on. Get on with it. Get on with it. JOE: Come on. You're making me mad. All right, big man. (LAUGHING) JOE: Kiss it. Ooh. (ALL LAUGHING) I like that. Yeah. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) Joe, do Bogart. I don't do Bogart no more. Here you go. Hiya, kids. How are you? Oh, yeah, this time... DIRECTOR: Action! Cut, cut, cut! That's no good for me. Where's all that noise coming from? All right, everybody, again from the top. Myron, well, get those people out of there, will you? Hey, what's this? Aw, some Hollywood creeps, makin' a gangster picture. What do they know... (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) In case you don't know it, you should. That guy is, er, Crazy Joe. What? So, who the hell am I to know who I am? (ALL CHUCKLE) Who do you like better, Sartre or Camus? Oh, Camus, of course. He's a much better writer. Ah, but not the better man. He committed suicide because he was afraid to really go against the world as it is. You see, in a strange way, society respects the criminal, because the criminal has the guts to go against the social order. The criminal is really another existential expression. Joe, how about another drink? How are you, Joe? Have you met Judge Holms? I don't think so. How are you? Fine, fine. Oh, a cigar? Sure, sure. Oh, there's Jacqueline. Joe, excuse us, one second. Cuban? Yeah. I thought the importation of Cuban products was illegal. I'm surprised at you, Judge. (CHUCKLES) Oh, Joe, if you can spare the time, Don Vittorio would like to talk to you tonight at his place, about 11:00. Yeah, I can spare it. Wonderful aroma. Tastes even better than I remember. (CHUCKLES) Isn't it funny how things you get on the sly always seem better? Here's J.D. MAN: Joe. Joe. Why you gotta take these guys with you up there? They're gonna cause trouble. Hey! I just want to see the look on Don Vittorio's face when we walk in. All right, maybe, just maybe, you're pushing too much. I'm a pusher! Look, do you think I want to spend the rest of my life in the backrooms of restaurants with a bunch of hoods in Brooklyn, making plots? I'm socially mobile. Capisce? Okay, Joe, okay. Socially mobile. Hiya, Angie. Hiya, Joey. The blacks wait here. Aw, Angie, we got invitations. All right, but the blacks wait here! Just... (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Hey, your boy's got bad manners, Don Vittorio. All right, Angelo. You bending my threads, baby. Hold it, Joey. Okay. Come in, Joe. Keep your sweaty hands off my vines! DON VITTORIO: Ah, Joey, Joey, you remind me when I was your age. I was tough, uh? Sit down, sit down. I'd do what I want, don't listen to nobody. Oh, Dio. Can we skip the hearts and flowers? Why do you insult me by bringing these kind of people here? If you're insulted, that's your business. They're my people. And us. What are we? No, Joe, you don't figure it right. I always wanted the best for you. Ah, sure. I fixed it so you and Richie could push Falco. When you moved against Coletti, I didn't interfere. But now you want to hurt me. I don't understand. You got everything you want, right in your hands. But why, why? I'm just taking what should have been mine. Mine and Richie's, a long time ago. Like I told you, the world's changing. And it's time we changed this thing of ours, too. Change, huh? That's all I hear about, change. Today, men are women, women are men. All you hear is that there's no law, no order. Now, you don't want to get mixed up in this craziness, Joe. Can you change your history? Your birth? You do this, you only cause more confusion, you spill more blood. And why? In the end it's always the same. You try to destroy this thing of ours, this thing that feeds you, you can destroy yourself. Finish with the blacks. You leave my business alone. I give you everything Coletti had. His family, all his operations... Your place of honor. What do you say? It's not yours to give anymore, Vittorio. I'm taking it. (BELL TOLLING) Tell Coletti's people, all the other families, they're free to do what they want with Joe. Buon appetito! Hey, listen to this guy. We got him talking guinea. Here's to you, Willy. Hey, waiter? Save that place for me. I'll send you a picture. WAITER: Si, signore. (ALL LAUGH) JOE: I'm the owner. You know what that means? Sir, yes, my Lord. (ALL CHUCKLE) MAN: Here to you, Willy. Hey, waiter! (ALL LAUGH) Joey, happy birthday. JOE: Ah, thank you, Mannie. Hey, this is empty. Some more wine here! WAITER: Si, signore. Subito, subito. In our territory? You sure it's him? MAN: Of course I'm sure. Okay, okay. In case he moves, call me at Jimmy's. But he's got people with him, the girlfriend. Some civilians. The hell with that. We take him and we take him now. Sonny will bring the pieces. Phil's with me. All right, we're on our way. Oh, Willy, it wouldn't be an Italian feast without cannoli for a finale. And spumoni, and tortoni, and sambuca. Okay, Joey, it's your night. Hey, but next time, man, its chitterlings, hog maws, sweet potato pie! (SONG PLAYING OVER RADIO) This seafood's an aphrodisiac. When I get you home, madonna, are you gonna get it! Joey! Watch out! (ANNE SCREAMS) No! No! JOE: I'm gonna kill you, you son of a bitch. You son of a bitch! Shoot, Willy! (GUNSHOTS) No, no, no, no, no! JOE: Not here, not here. Okay, okay, baby. I'm going to move you. Come on. (GRUNTS) (SOBBING) Get away! (SIRENS WAILING) Get away! (ANNE SOBBING) (YELLS) Get away! (SIRENS WAILING)
