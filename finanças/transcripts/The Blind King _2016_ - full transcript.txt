Hey, Slim! How are you doing, huh? Oh! Maggie's here too? Hey, Maggie! Tell me, did you show Maggie round the house? What did she think, huh? Did she like it? Hey, Sue Q! Oh! You look great! Why are you so obsequious? Uh... Obsequious? Is that how they speak in... That's fancy. Yeah. Is that how they speak in Rome? Paris? Berlin, uh... Somewhere? Hey, hey. Okay. Um... I'm sorry. Let's start over again, okay? Good morning, and welcome to our house! Oh, God. You are a horrible actor. Yeah, I know. I am, aren't I? That's why I make movies and don't act in them. How's the move going? It's good. I mean, it's a lot of boxes, endless boxes, but more I put away, the more I sort things out, I sort things out. Are you going to fill this place with all your usual junk? All my usual junk, yeah. I mean, that's what makes it home. I thought you were looking for a new start. Yeah, well... Well, for someone who is trying to run away from his past... Run away from my what? I just don't think it's a good idea to keep looking at the same old photos in the same places they were before. Wow. One second, Sue Q, huh? Only took you one second to make me wish I hadn't invited you over. Jesus... Hey! My little princess! Wow! Oh, you've grown so much since I last saw you. Yeah, I know. That was only like three, four months ago, right? Mmm... Oh! I'm sorry, I forgot. Hey, Maggie! How are you? You never grow bigger, do you? Baby, why don't you take Maggie and go play somewhere for a little while, okay? 'Cause I gotta talk to your auntie. Yes, go. Could you stop being a bitch for once, please? What can I get you? A coffee? You got it. May I? Yes, you may. Now you're smoking toothpicks. Hey, these are menthols. Hmm? A lot better than that crap you smoke. Have you completely given up? Actually... See this? It's the last remaining pack of cigarettes. One cigarette still in it. So I was smoking, like, two and half packs after Helen... You know, it was a... A difficult period. And Jennifer? How long has she been like that? Like what? Christ, Craig. Like that. She doesn't speak, she doesn't play, she doesn't run around the house. I mean, there's no light in her eyes and her best friend is a fluffy doll. She has me. She has me and... And she could have you too. How's work going? Good. Mmm. Yeah, I did a wedding this month. Next month, I have a... A video. A music video. Work, Craig. Uh, I work three days a week at the warehouse. On the weekends, I unload trucks with a bunch of guys, you know. Craig. They're good guys, you know. I'm learning Spanish. I... I manage! I know. Of course. But here there's a little angel who deserves much better than this. Craig, she needs qualified help. She's 10 years old. She should be happy! Christ! Sue Q, I need help. I need, uh, non-qualified help. Just listen to yourself. It's easy for you to ask for help, but not so easy to give it. You haven't visited Dad in months, you wouldn't even recognize him, and you ask for help? You've seen her, right? She used to say yes, she used to say no, she used to speak! Now she doesn't even speak at all. The only way she communicates is through her drawings, you know? Her drawings. Drawings? She's seeing things too. I went to the school to talked to her teachers. Now I talk to the, uh, lady pediatrician... And what did they say? They said it was normal. They said it's normal for a little girl to personify her fears, especially so long after losing her mother, and you know, "The ghost of the empty space." It's normal, I think. Jesus Christ, you know... What she saw... She's my little girl, you know, I... I think I know how she feels. I don't think I can't take it anymore. I try to make things as normal as I can, and then I can't sleep. And when I do sleep, I have these fuckin' nightmares. And I'm sick and tired of hearing my own voice bouncin' off the walls in this house, you know. I just want to forget it, you know, and move on. And I need your help, Sue Q. Show me the drawings. It doesn't seem so drastic to me, Craig. I mean, the school is right. She is shocked, full of fear. Look, this is how she expresses her... Her internal monsters. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what they say. It's normal. I mean, I believe it. I mean, I wanna believe it, all right? But, um... I don't know, man. I'm just tired. But why don't you just stay here three days with us, okay? You... For the both of us, please. Ah! Yeah, I think there's a spy... There's two spies spying on us. Guess what? I'm the best spy I know, and I'll teach you all my secrets! Please, just go upstairs and later we play hide and seek, okay? I promise. Go, go, go. Are you sure moving house was the right thing to do? Yeah. I was going crazy. Well, it doesn't seem to have helped. Ha-ha. Okay, sorry. If you ask me, I wouldn't worry about the drawings. But please, find a way to make her smile again. So, that's a no? If I'll come and stay for a few days? Yes. It's a no. Look, um, Sue Q... We had some fun today, huh? I mean, you... You made her really happy. It was like a family. You know, we need you. Both of us. I'll always be there. For Jennifer. All right, bye. Hey! Baby... Please, hmm? Things will get better soon. Are you thirsty? Jenny, don't leave your toys lying around, okay? Especially around a dirty old attic. I gotta get that door fixed, I don't even have the key for it I can trust you on this, right? Ah! Beautiful. Beautiful! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, go, go, go. Yay! Go! Go! Go! Wow. Okay. That's right. By yourself, baby. Go... Go, go, go. Can't see. Ah. Ah. There it is! Ta-da! You like watching these, don't you? Not bad! Okay. She's ready. She's ready. Tell you what, I wanna watch 'em too. We can watch 'em together. Oh, my God, she... Oh! Yeah! Here we go, here we go, I'm over here. Whoa! Yay! Oh, my God. Okay, okay, here we go. Jennifer! And so began the legend of young Orpheus, the Thracian Prince. Neither Charon nor even the terrible Cerberus were able to prevent him from embracing his beloved. With a single word, he could capture the soul of anyone who listened to him. And that's why today, children all around the world can still hear his voice echoing in their ears. You... Can... Hear it... Don't you? Sweet dreams, hmm? Sleep tight. No bad dreams. I'm gonna turn this light out so nobody can see you. All right? Craig. I am here, Craig. Craig, you cannot run from yourself. Jennifer? Jennifer! What the fuck? Hey. You were concentrating hard there, huh? I didn't scare you, did I? Show me the drawing. Jenny, please. Show me the drawing. Please, Jenny, show me the drawing. Give me the drawing. This has got to stop. We can't carry on like this. Hmm? Come on. Is there a monster in here, hmm? You see a monster in here? You see anything in here apart from your clothes? Here? Is there a monster under here? Can you see him anywhere? Anywhere... But in your own head? What do you see that's... What do you see that explains all this? Are you trying to scare your dad, huh? You're scaring the shit out of me. What's wrong with you? Huh? You ain't convinced. Tell you what. You wanna search the whole house? Hmm? We can do that, I promise you. Inch by inch. You and me, okay? We'll light up every damn dark corner in the whole house until you're convinced that there is nothing lurking in the dark! All right? Nothing! Because there's nothing to be afraid of, you understand? Oh, Jesus... I'm sorry, Slim, I lost control. Forgive me, huh? Daddy is... Nervous. This is tough times for us, Honey. Daddy's a grump. Maggie knows, right? Maggie knows everything. "Why don't you leave her alone?" I miss Mommy too. A lot. So here's the deal, all right? If you really want to... I'll let you color all your drawings, all right? All right! Move to the right. It's all good though, hmm? You ready? It's coming your way now. Here we go. All right, let's see it! Show Daddy, show Daddy. Right, left, right. Get it by me. No! Not bad, huh? I've seen better. Not bad. Wait till you see this one, right? Oh. Yeah, she's definitely your daughter, Craig. Jenny! Hey, Jenny! Hey. Whoa! Do you see something? Come on, let's go, Hon. You cannot escape, Craig! Find yourself in my kingdom. Daddy, I'm here! Are you sure you looked everywhere, Craig? Can you honestly say you looked everywhere? What are you talking about, Susan? Look, Craig. Look everywhere. Make sure you search everywhere. The darkest corner is where the fallen coin is hidden. Suffering is the only path... To wake... From the slumber... Of the spirits. Look sin in the face. Enter your kingdom. Jennifer... I'm here. You can try to drown the truth in lies, but it will always resurface. Again... And again. No. No. No, not Jennifer. No, no. No. No. No! Hey. Can I come in? Did you sleep all right? No bad dreams? Where's Maggie? Hmm? You didn't have an argument with her, did you? I'm not going to find her up in the attic? Did you lose her? Do you know where she is? Yeah, Susan, uh... I... I need to see you. I... I have to see you. It's... Yeah, it's about Jennifer. Uh... Something strange has happened and I'm worried. Yeah, I'm very worried. Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, good, okay. You... You be there 'cause I'm gonna be there. All right, thanks. Thanks. Excuse me. Black coffee too, please. We'll end up being a real family if we keep meeting like this. Susan, right now, I really need you not to be a bitch. I'm really worried about Jennifer. Craig, we've been over this. No. It's different now. What do you mean? You know, I... I know she's still going through the shock and everything. Um... But it's not that, okay? Um... She's not normal, Sue Q. I mean, the dreams and the drawings and the drawings and the dreams... Her dreams? Thank you. Her dreams? I don't know. Um... I think I may have entered her dreams. What the hell are you talking about? I mean I can see them. I can get inside them. You do realize what you're saying? Yeah, I realize what I'm saying. I can't explain it, but it's true, okay? Listen to me. Now, I dream her dreams in some way. Um, her kingdom. I dream, um, with her. I see the same monsters in my sleep. And you're there too. Accusing me of something. Typical, right? But even in my dreams? You wanna know what the weirdest thing is? She can see my dreams too. I can prove it. Well? That's one of Jennifer's dream drawings, all right. Yes, and? Her imagination, right? Well, you tell me how she can see in my dream, Helen even putting little Maggie right there on the table, huh? Right there! How? Okay. Craig, um... I don't think there's anything wrong with Jenny. Nothing that can't be understood anyway. But I think there's something wrong with you. No, thanks. We're fine. Craig. The house is too big. House is too big. That's what it is. You know that? So, this is what we're gonna do. You are gonna move into the house with me and Jenny. All three in this big fuckin' house, okay? And you can save money and get a job 'cause you're not rolling in cash now, and you can earn some money and save money and then you can go to Paris or London or... Okay, okay, stop, stop. Stop, please. I... I don't want to get angry because it's obvious you're going through a hard time right now, but Jesus Christ, Craig! I'd rather live in my shitty apartment in this shitty city than accept your charity. Let's see. Susie saves her rent money to go back to Paris and Craig saves the money for a therapist. In that way, Craig can save his daughter's life and Susie might stop complaining. Wow! Am I wrong, Craig? You... You are wrong. I'm not! Like hell I'm coming to stay with you! Do you really expect that I could wake up every morning in the house that you can enjoy because you left our parents to get old in a hospice? That's... Don't interrupt... Don't interrupt me! Of course, our parents offered to help you and you? You were more than ready with your "Thank you!" You prepared it for more than a year. What... What did you use to say? Ah, yes! "Mom, please. This film will be my turning point. "This film will realize my dream, I swear! "This film is the right occasion!" Christ! You were like Orpheus. With a single word you captured anybody's soul. Even I used to fall under your magic spell. And this is how Orpheus managed to pay for his dreams. With his parents' money. And what happened to the money, Craig? What happened to your film? What happened to your dream? Was it worth our mom dying alone in a fucking hospice? Shut up! Shut up! That's a low blow for you. You, especially. You deserve it, Craig! And this is what you don't understand. You're nothing! Nothing but a jerk! Susie. Susie! Susie! Sorry I took so long, Baby. Did you get bored? Hey, Slim. What's wrong? Get your pajamas. You're not spending another night in here. For Christ's sake! Please. Okay, Slim. Good night. I'm gonna sleep right over there. No. Impossible. Impossible. Daddy! Daddy! I'm here! You are nothing but a failure, Craig. I married a fucking failure. You won me over with your beautiful words. This shit, Craig, is better than you. Give me this shit! A failure. A failure! As a father, as a son, as a brother, as a lover, as a man. A failure, Craig. Jennifer... Come here. Daddy! Jennifer. Baby. Jennifer... Come here. Daddy, I'm here! Daddy's here, huh? Jennifer, Daddy's here. Hey. Hey, Jennifer, it's Daddy, huh. Daddy's here. Everything's okay, all right? Huh? Everything's all right. Jenny! Jenny! I believe you are here for your daughter, Craig. Here she is. For every act of grace, there is a sacrifice to make. Are you ready to suffer? Are you ready to open your eyes? Who are you? Minuscule puppet torn between spirit and flesh. What are your sins? No truth to discover, only guilt to confess. It's a question of perspective. Tell me, are you a man or a coward? No. No! Good morning. Malcom House. How can I help? Yeah, this is, um, Craig Summers. I'm the son of Henry Summers. Uh, Henry Summer. Yes, I know. Okay, perfect. Um... Nothing. Uh, I just wanted to know... I was gonna come by to see... I wanted to call first to first see if I can come by and see how my dad was? You can ask him yourself, Mr. Summer. We are not a hospital. But I am glad you called. We've been trying to contact you at the number you gave us, but there was no answer. Um, I'm, uh... I'm sorry. We moved. Ah. I see. Uh, your father can no longer stay here. Uh, we cannot help him. What are you talking about? Excuse me for being direct, but it's best if we get to the point. Your father's condition has worsened and he needs medical assistance. As you are his next of kin, you will have to come and deal with the necessary paperwork and an eventual transfer to a hospital. Ah, Mr. Summer. Regarding the payment... Fuck! Jenny! Jenny! Susan, this is Craig, um... I know you don't wanna talk right now, 'cause... And that you think I'm a jerk. It seems most everybody now thinks I'm a jerk. I'm starting to believe it myself. Anyway, um... What I gotta tell you is pretty difficult to explain. It's... It's even more difficult to believe. But you're the only person can understand me. Or put up with me. You try. You always try. You always will. Um... I know you love me despite everything and I, uh... I love you too. Um... You know, in my life, uh, I made a lot of mistakes, a lot of bad choices, and fate's never... Never always been on my side. Ah, but... Jennifer is, uh, the only thing I've got. She's everything. And, uh, something strange is happening. Something strange is happening and you know, if you can't understand that, and if you can't help me, then... Then nobody else can. You see, Jennifer's in danger now. He's taken her some place that only I can go. And I will go there. Because I will enter hell for Jenny. I will enter hell for Jenny. You know, maybe, uh, you know, it'll make up for some of the pain I've caused. See, you're the only person I trust. You're the only good person I know. And you're... You're the only person I know Jennifer will be safe with. So, please forgive me. And I love you. Craig. Come. I'm here. Craig... Daddy, here! Come. Daddy! Dad! Come. Come closer. Daddy! Daddy! I'm here! Daddy! Daddy! Honey, it's ready. Put your toys away and come down. Hey, Mom. Dad? Craig, my son. Why did you do this to us? Right up until my dying breath in that prison you locked us up in. Your father stared at the door, hoping to see you come through it. Then I died. She whispered your name before leaving me. For you we forgot ourselves! I would... I couldn't... I done something, uh... Forgive me. You are selfish and ungrateful. An opportunist. We let ourselves die in that rat hole. For you. Did we deserve it? After your sister ran away from home? Alone! We lost ourselves. We lost our children. Don't say these things. We lost our hope! Okay. Look... Forgive me for... For everything. Please, Dad. I'm sorry. Please forgive me, Dad. Both of you, just forgive me. Indifference poisons the soul. Time corrupts everything. You cannot help us anymore, Craig. You can't help yourself. You can't help Jennifer. She is with us now. Craig... Now she is food. You cannot escape. Food for The Blind King. Susan. Stop. Stop. What do you want from me, huh? What do you want from me? The truth is merciless. The longer it is kept silent, the harder it is to accept. But the time has come for you to open your eyes, Craig. Please, listen to me. Please forgive me, okay? I just... I want Jennifer. I want my daughter. Please forgive me, all right? For everything! Your tears are useless. He who is afraid of suffering is not worthy of his sin. You are the creator of the suffering that surrounds you. Now is the time to pay. Please, please. I know I got it all wrong, but right now, I need Jennifer. Please, forgive me. We need you! You're not understanding. It is a deliberate choice. Are you afraid of the dark? Or is it perhaps the light that blinds you? Know your demons, Craig. What are they like? Look for the infinite shadow of truth in your dreams. It is not me you should bow down to. I am nothing but the shadow of your guilt. You don't want to see, you don't want to look. You don't want to open your eyes. I can forgive you, but I cannot absolve you. Kneel down to his will. Daddy, you're here! Can you give me Maggie back? Jennifer... You give me back my daughter, you bastard! From birth to death, man does nothing but judge. Every single human being lives in the unwavering belief that theirs is the only judgment. Yet, they abhor being judged themselves. It is a sign of abomination. "I am not like that." "I cannot be reduced to this." Only I know the truth. She's innocent, she's the best thing I've got. Fools! The eye that judges does not accept judgment on the one thing it cannot set its gaze upon. Itself. I never meant to hurt anybody. Ignorance is a blessing, Craig, but for the blessing to be complete, ignorance must be blind unto itself. I'm sorry. You spent your whole life selfishly chasing your dreams, trampling on those who surround you, hidden under your cloak of nobility. I'm begging you. Look at me, Craig! Look at yourself. Kneel before me, Craig. It is time to change your perspective. Relax, Craig. Open your eyes, welcome the demon. Look inside yourself. I repeat. Are you a man or a coward? You are nothing but a failure, Craig. I married a fucking failure. A pathetic failure in his world of bullshit and pipe dreams. It's all my fault for not listening to my mother. Your mother. But you have no right to criticize me. Do you understand me, Craig? Jesus Christ, Helen. You realize that we're not in high school anymore? You know we have a house, and we have a daughter? No, no, no, Craig. You know what? You are messing your head up with that shit. I think those pills you take are messing with your head. Craig, what do you think this shit is for, hmm? It helps me to forget. To forget this shitty life with you that I've ended up with. To forget that I was such an idiot to let myself be deluded by a jerk like you. This shit, Craig, is better than you. Give me this shit! You know what? I ain't asking you for my sake, you clown! You want to kill yourself? Then go ahead. But first, maybe you should think about, uh, doing something, um... Anything. Okay? So your daughter doesn't end up like you. How dare you? I support you! You and that whining kid! You won me over with your beautiful words. You know how to charm with words, Craig. The problem is that there is nothing behind them! Okay, okay. "Kid"? Uh, she has a name, all right? Jennifer, our daughter! So why don't you just leave her out of your living hell? This wasn't the life you promised me. This isn't the life I wanted! But it will end soon, I can assure you! I've already spoken with my lawyer. You'll be out on the street! Yes, you heard right. I'm going to take everything. The house and your daughter, the love of your life. You owe me it. I'm going to take every last penny. You know what? You're delirious right now. Every last penny. And you're fucking high as a kite. You're not gonna take anything from me. Try and stop me. I can just see your face. Who will you go to then, with your cap in hand and that beaten dog expression? To your sister? To your parents? Oh, by the way, how are they, Craig? Don't you talk about my family! Not one word! Hmm? A failure. A failure! As a father, as a son, as a brother, as a lover, as a man. A failure, Craig. See, this is what Jennifer has to put up with. You know that? Because this is who you are! Jesus Christ! What the... Mom? Jenny. Jenny. Daddy couldn't... Daddy couldn't save Mommy. Couldn't save Mommy. Mommy's not here anymore. All right? Mommy's not... She's not here anymore. Oh, Jesus, God! What have I done? You lived as a parasite, feeding on others, not seeing anybody but yourself. And when you realized it was too late, you looked for redemption in your daughter. Jennifer... Please forgive me. Please! But you failed, Craig. You failed in creating a life for yourself. You failed in saving your daughter's life. Please give me back my daughter. Just tell me what you wanna do! Your selfishness and blindness prevented you from seeing that you failed in saving your one reason for living. And she will pay the price. What can I do? You didn't want to see the suffering you caused. You didn't want to face up to the mistakes you made and she will pay the consequences. It's up to you to decide, Craig. Are you ready to accept your guilt and sacrifice yourself to me in exchange for your daughter's life? You have finally seen everything that you refused to accept. Your eyes, your soul, belong to me. Accept your guilt. Accept who you are. Enter my kingdom. No. No, I can't leave Jennifer. No, I... I won't leave Jennifer alone... I did this for her. Only for her. Because I won't let anybody separate us. Not my parents, my family, not my sister Susan... Not Helen. My wife Helen. My fucking wife Helen! I sacrificed everything for Jennifer so she wouldn't have to grow up around all that hate. All that hate. I killed Helen for Jennifer. I did it. And you know what? I'd do it again. You wanna know why? 'Cause I will not allow danger around my daughter. She has never needed anything! You have chosen not to see. There is nothing more you can do for her. So you leave us alone. You leave us alone, you motherfucker! Come on, baby. Let's go. Jennifer... Craig! Craig! You're not my mother. My mother is dead. You're not my mother. No... My mother is dead. You're not my mother. Craig! Craig! Jennifer! Open the door! Craig! Craig! My mother's dead. This is who you are, Craig. This is what you have harvested. And Jennifer is your punishment. Craig? Jenny! Craig! Jenny! Craig! Jenny! Forgive me, Baby. Daddy's coming. Craig? Craig? Jenny. Craig! Craig. Welcome to my kingdom.
