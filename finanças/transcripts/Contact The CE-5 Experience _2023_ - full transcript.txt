April, 2020, just as the world was shutting down for the first time an interesting documentary called Close Encounters Of The Fifth Kind appeared online. It claims that a group of people have figured out how to make contact with UFO's and it promised to teach you how to do it. Suddenly this mysterious little movie was everywhere. I've come to learn that the way to make these interactions with these beings are by expanding our consciousness. So, through meditation we actually can make contact a lot easier. And, it's been so many times where I've been meditating and I've looked up and there's something in the sky. There's a documentary called Close Encounters Of The Fifth Kind. I believe it's about this organization, it came out during quarantine, that goes out and does these circles where they call in UFO's, and they have videos of it and all these different things. My name is Serena DC and I saw Close Encounters Of The Fifth Kind the second it came out. I followed all of the instructions and, sure enough, I had my own life changing contact experience. I wanted to learn more about Close Encounters Of The Fifth Kind, CE5 for short, so, I reached out to Dr. Steven Greer, the man behind the documentary, an advocate for all of these radical ideas. Dr. Greer granted me exclusive, never before seen access to one of his advanced workshops where he teaches his protocols. So my team packed their bags and headed straight for Oracle, Arizona. This is what happened. People from all around the world travel to these exclusive retreats to meet Dr. Greer and to learn his protocols for contacting extra-terrestrial beings and craft. We sat down with a few of the attendees in Oracle to get their perspective on learning and practicing CE5 on Dr. Greer himself and their expectations for the event. I'm so excited about going to Oracle because, even though I've had my own CE5 experience, I feel like being with Dr. Steven Greer, learning how to do the protocols properly, and being around a group of people that are going to also be trying to communicate with UFO's, um, I might see something pretty amazing. I had no expectations coming to Oracle. I was open to whatever we were going to see. I heard that some people had individual experiences and there were other people that had group experiences. I just hoped we would get to see something. What are you hoping to see? Um, that's a great question. Personally I don't recommend having an expectation because then you're leaving yourself for a place to be disappointed or let down. And, when you don't have an expectation, then you come in with an open mind, and an open heart. And what happens is supposed to happen. And you are left getting exactly what you're supposed to get. And, you know, that comes from a better place of unknowing, where you don't know what's out there, you know. And when you're expecting something else you're assuming that you know what's out there. It's been interesting to see the diverse group of people that have been attracted to this CE5 event. I really thought that most people that came here would be a little bit trippy, a little bit weird, a little bit fringe, like me, but, they're not. They're people from all different walks of life. We've got CEO's from major corporations, and then, we've got the person that helps you pump your gas. It's super diverse and it's really exciting. I'm honored to be here and I'm honored to be at a time where we know what CE5 is, you know. In the 1950s you had Roswell, you had all of these unbelievable, unexplained experiences but there was never... it was all top secret. Nobody was thinking about making contact or how to make contact. Now, here we are in 2022 and we're thinking about how can we come together, and how can we make contact and what's out there? And so rather than thinking about there's something else out there that's a threat to our humanity, and that might want to destroy us, maybe it's just something that just wants to teach us about ourselves, and to teach us about love, and inter galactic love. Whatever that looks like. CE5, for me, means big, broad, exciting spectrum of communication with all sorts of consciousness that exists within us, folded within us. The spectrum that we have, you know, in my belief system, we are multi-dimensional, so there's that whole spectrum that we have folded within us. And then, there is, of course, everything else in the universe which is so huge, so it's a big term and if you look at it from that angle... but, you know, encapsulating and it's really, for me personally, it's the desire to explore that, and find ways of communicating with other types of consciousness. The purpose of CE5 for me is to think outside the box of what normal human interaction is, and to understand the consciousness and the collective that's out there, and to be able to put yourself in a position of a calm state of mind where you're open. And your heart and your mind are open to exploring something else that's beyond what our realm of consciousness currently is. I mean, we've seen some really unexplainable bright lights, geometric shapes. There's been all kinds of out of nowhere shooting stars that were bigger than shooting stars that couldn't be explained. You know, at first we thought they were meteor showers... Somebody that was with me at the time, one of my dear friends, saw something the size of a moon that was red, there was a glowing orb, and we were all sober. We were all with an open heart and an open mind and we saw things that we could never explain. And that when we weren't doing CE5, we never saw. One of the biggest draws to Oracle, Arizona, for me, was the story of ED Moen. I'm ED Moen and I'm from Mineral Point, Wisconsin. It was a very emotional experience. It's kind of emotional for me to be back here after four years. I left CE5 at about one o'clock in the morning. I felt this calling. I went back out into the desert after leaving the group and ran into this extra-terrestrial out in the desert and, uh... We connected and I invited it over, you know, we hung out all night. I had asked him for a healing on my hearing because I had this hearing problem my whole life, and it just occurred to me that they were healers. I could sense that. So, I said, " It seems like you guys might be able to help me with this. "Do you mind doing something?" And I forgot about it. I spent the whole night in the desert playing hide and seek, and going for walks with this entity until sunrise, and I realized I should get some sleep. I had to say goodnight or goodbye, you know. I woke up the next morning and I could hear everyone. So it was quite an experience. I didn't expect that to happen at all, coming here. ED is completely healed. And what happened to him here in Oracle, Arizona, literally changed his life forever. Coming to Oracle, doing a CE5 with Dr. Steven Greer gave him his hearing back, and changed his entire life. Seeing things in the sky is one thing, but having an entity like that, with that kind of vibration standing right next to you is, uh... It was just highly emotional. It was really high energy. Being that close to that kind of presence got my attention. You know, they're really loving, sweet beings. You know? So I finally had the opportunity to sit down with Dr. Steven Greer. And the first thing I wanted to know is what can we expect on one of these retreats? Some people think they're going to go and do the CE5 protocols and a massive flying saucer is going to appear, and land on the ground and ET is gonna come out and, you know, "phone home". That's not gonna happen, but... - It actually does sometimes. - Yeah. Yeah, but you know, 99 out of a 100 it's not gonna happen. So I think it'll be really great if you could just explain a little bit about what people can expect. What's typical? It runs the gamut. It goes from just people having and experiencing consciousness to hearing a tone come through the room. So, not necessarily seeing anything - but seeing it in the minds. - Well remember, primacy, I say, is with consciousness. The consciousness field is reality. And, as the Vedas say, all this is that. All that you see is actually consciousness resonating and phasing as that light or a photon, or a star, or a tree. This gets into a deep understanding of the science of consciousness and how it integrates into the physical world and science. For that reason we're dealing with civilizations that have mastered that. Because we would have already been decades into an era of mastering the science of consciousness had we not been delayed a hundred years by the industrial fascists that have kept the fundamental sciences secret. And kept everybody distracted. Yeah, we're catching up here. We're trying to catch up before it's too late, to be honest with you. There are all kinds of things that can happen. One time we had a team, I was out there in West Virginia. It had been cloudy and rainy, like it is in the East Coast so much of the time. And they were ready to leave. And they were going, "Ugh, we wish we had seen ET." The clouds parted - and a cloud formed the letters ET in the sky. - ET! Right up there. Huge. And people go, " Really?" Weird stuff like that happens all the time. And it was mysterious but beautiful. And so, for whatever reason, they couldn't come in 3D but they did that. Yeah. They have a sense of humor for sure. They're very funny. They're very funny. Well, I think, you know, they're extremely smart. And I think bright people are funny. You could see anything. It could be a light, it could be a light doing some geometrical shapes. It could, you know, just blink. I mean, we never know. When they prep you for coming to this event they really specify not having those kinds of expectations, but, what expectations not to have, you know, about the whole evil alien and kind of, expecting the ET's to perform like they're in Sea World or something like that. I came to the retreat to further the work of contact with ET's furthering my own ability to make contact with them because I feel that engaged contact is gonna shift consciousness more than doing it by ourselves. I think they wanna help mankind as much as they can but, I don't think, you know, with all the negativity in the world, I don't think they're ready to just, you know... They've already evolved way past any of the things that we're going through. The ET's are here to help us. They are not here to hurt us. And, so that is their agenda. And they want to help us to become an actual civilization instead of an uncivilized planet. And to do that we need to raise our vibration and they're helping us to do that. I'm quite surprised how deeply they're helping us. It's very... it just boggles the mind how much they are doing to help. For me CE5 has enriched my life by allowing me to understand that we're not the only thing that's out there. And there's a lot more. And, maybe, it's not a national threat. Maybe it's something that's positive, maybe it's something that's full of love, and maybe there's another level of consciousness and love that we haven't even achieved or felt yet. So the reoccurring theme that I keep hearing over and over again when I talk to Dr. Steven Greer, and all of the people that have gone to the CE5 retreat is that these extra terrestrials are not here to harm us. In fact, they're here to help us. So, my understanding of the necessary parameters, in the human domain or context, in order to establish contact is from a frequency perspective. Again, using that model of, you know, like an accordion, if you like. Here's the physical, here's the one, if you like, or the omnipresent consciousness. And through there there's many phases of consciousness itself. We're quite locked as a species, right now, into the tangible. And that's okay, but we need to drop that when we approach something that we know absolutely nothing about. Very, very little about. And embrace the value of not knowing. So it is a limitation of us when we put things into little cognitive cupboards really quickly and we say, "I've experienced this "and they're from this planet, "and that's done and I'll put it over there." Well, that's quite a severe limitation on a context that is infinite, essentially. So, we have to move beyond the physicality of things and look at it from a point of not knowing. We've been talking about the foundational element level of the cosmos is the unbounded, undifferentiated, pure conscious field. And it's infinite, it has no beginning in space and time. It is indivisible. It is a singularity. And that's how we are all awake. So, it's like a ray of that infinite aspect is what enables us to be conscious and sentient. And the meditative state is to basically experience that mind as it then becomes expanded in this state. And, if you experience it in this state it's the samadhi state, it's the state of boundlessness, and bliss, and being, that you all have heard about. And of course, many of you have experienced periodically. When I talk about this resonant realm of thought, sound, the primal or initiating emanation from the plain of the absolute is actually what's called the primal thought of the great being that is that first impulse from absolute nothingness of the absolute fullness of pure consciousness as it manifests into relativity. That primal thought, initial thought sound is unbelievably beautiful. I've experienced it a few times. And it is... has within it every infinite possibility of any other sound, resonance, frequency thought that would be within a star, or your body, or the carpet, or that house, or the rock. All of it has tonality associated with it even at the most expressed three dimensional level. So, you can go from fully external, call it, aspect, it's how you're perceiving it, of the quantum hologram of cosmology, of, say, your body and your individuality, or gazing at a blade of grass. And every blade of grass has within it this tonality of that unique thing. The signature that's actually a sound component of thought within the blade of grass. And then, from there it differentiates into the, so called, astral, subtle light energy that's within the blade of grass. And then, from there into 3D biological material expression. You can go, therefore, from anything that you want to contemplate, and go straight, deeper and deeper in your perception until you actually experience the primal thought and transcend into the unbounded ocean. So it can go from outward-in, or from inward-out. The creative aspect the way existence comes out of nothingness is this. So as the sun began to set the team of CE5'ers and Dr. Steven Greer headed up Oracle's hill set up their chairs and got comfortable. Then Dr. Greer began to lead everyone through the CE5 protocols. The first of which was a guided meditation. So let us close our eyes and let's take some deep breaths. Sitting quietly, enjoy the peace of this sacred place. Breathe in with your nose deeply. The revivifying breath of mother earth. And see yourself awakened and energized through the prana and the chi, the lifeforce. And as you exhale, relax from the toes to the top of your head. We feel our bodies filled with light and energy, and our awareness expanding, and clear. And as we exhale, we let go of all of our concerns, all stress, all worries, and settle into that great peace within. And see that the conscious mind never changes. It is always the pure, unbounded light of awareness. Your perceptions change. The field of consciousness is changeless and one. And so we see that all that exists is pure consciousness resonating in various densities, frequencies, into whatever that object or person is. That the conscious mind itself we can experience in its pure, unbounded form. What I experienced is... It's like if you think of the heart's bio electro magnetic field, it resonates at a certain frequency. So when we are in a state of unity consciousness, we're in a state of gratitude, when we are in a state of one with ourselves and others and we really embody that, we are, through the consciousness spectrum, we are uplifting, you know, we're resonating, high vibes. And I believe that makes it easier for these highly advanced, highly intelligent, empathic beings to bond, to resonate with our electromagnetic field. And through that they can simply convey huge amounts of information. All my life I knew there were ET's out there, my entire life, ever since I was a little boy. But everything I looked at in the media was all... I knew that wasn't right. And I really had a hard time finding that right path that I knew inside, internally. When I found Dr. Greer I said, this is a no mess around guy. This is different from all the mainstream that's out there. I knew I was in the right place. I almost feel like there was a divine ET just helping me connect to you because I was searching for you my whole life since I was probably seven years old. And finally I got what it really is not what the mainstream puts it as. And I knew that was genuine truth. After that I went into one of your expeditions in Oracle and in Joshua Tree. And there I realized that through my inner peace inside of me, this is where I would speak to the ET's out there. It wasn't about getting a picture of a craft or seeing a UFO land. It was everything internally, inside. And it was just wired in me. And that first day we were in circle, it was amazing, but I didn't see anything. And I was okay with that. I had someone sit next to me, he was probably in his mid-seventies, and he told me, "You know I don't expect to see anything out here this week, "so I think this is a waste of my time." I said, "Oh, okay." So, second, third day, what happens in these groups is there's a coherence, a bond between the group. And when there's a love, a connection there it almost just enhances the part of making contact because we're together, we're one. There's a fine love there between all of us. And it was the first time that I saw an ET in my entire life with my physical eyes. Here I am on the third day and you're telling us, "Do not be afraid. Welcome them. Thank them for coming." And here we have on my left side, on the third night, an orb coming out from underneath the ground. And it's just hovering nice and slow. And I'm like, " Okay, wow, that's interesting. I've never seen a car do that." There was a road back there. And it started getting bigger, and bigger and it came up to, maybe, thirty feet in the air. I'm like, that's nice and I kept turning and you are here, and the orb kept coming over here. And it started coming towards me and it started getting bigger and it was just a pulsating, almost like an orange, yellowish light. It was just slowly coming towards me, and I'm like, "Holy shit." And I started getting scared inside. And you warned us about this when we were in the meditation section of the retreat. And then, the orb started going away little, by little, as I was getting afraid. And I realize, "Oh, my God, this is actually happening." Then it started coming back up through the mountain again and it started coming closer and closer. As it got closer, I could feel a love, a sense of... A sense of oneness with them. And it was so powerful. And it slowly went back down to the ground. And then, there I knew it was gonna be an amazing, amazing week. Hearing these stories has been so inspiring for me because I really thought it was just all about seeing a couple of lights in the sky. But, it's not. These people are having massive, telepathic experiences. They're going up into craft. They're having communications with extra-terrestrials. This is a really huge deal. You'd be very surprised at how easy it is to connect. And once that connection's established, it only gets better and better, and better, and better. It becomes so eloquent, and so sophisticated, and so highly specialized and intelligent that you know... And it's always within the spectrum of unity. That's the only time contact occurs. If there's fear or division they just won't interact, but if the context of unity is there it just keeps on getting closer and more intimate. Beings, lights will come right into your home. It will just be absolutely incredible. There was one time we were in Denver, and... I had this strain of thoughts in my head realizing that we need to take responsibility and we have to be the primary movers, but it starts with us as people. And they will help, they will assist and support us but we have to be the primary movers. And I remember when we were meditating I opened my eyes, I turned to my right and there's this golden craft that was phasing in and out. And, so I went back into meditative state, and then after the meditation I shared it with the group, and I took the laser and I was pointing towards the craft. And then, where I saw the craft, and all of a sudden it manifested again. And so, to me it was very encouraging to know that they will always, you know, they're here to support us but it's not their job to do. We have to be the primary movers and they will support our endeavor. We share the same vision for the planet and that's what we have in common and we're a team. And what do you think that vision is that we're sharing? To create a world that's loving, and peaceful, and abundant. And to become interstellar. That's the most exciting part. I can't wait for that. It's such a humbling, but also empowering, and inspiring perspective to hear. The fact that we do need to take the first step, but when we do they're gonna be there to help us. You know this work has only just begun, so, we're... There's this little doorway Dr. Greer has just, kind of, opened for us, so, we've got to go like that and just expand out so that everybody can walk through. I believe our future is an interstellar future. So I'd like to fast track that. You know, peace, unified energy, in terms of abundance and production on our planet. And then, interstellar civilizations, and this motion of we welcome you, and I'd like to visit your planet too. That's just, you know, that's so exciting to me. I think it is for a lot of people. And if you're listening to this and this... I was thinking about this as I was driving up from Charlottesville. Probably the most important thing I'd say amongst all of this deluge of verbs and adjectives, is that, if you're resonating with that thought then put the protocols to practice. Go out in the field, test them out. See what responses you get. So I wanted to learn more about how all this is possible from a scientific perspective. So I asked Dr. Greer to what extent do scientists understand this phenomenon? In the 70s and forward, really good scientific studies were done on the effect of consciousness remotely. So, everyone thinks that the consciousness, whereby, you and I are awake, are two separate things. The consciousness field is a singularity. There's one consciousness field in the creation. It's just illuminating each of our individualities. Meditation is the process of going deep and experiencing that point of all light, the source. And it's that state, and that's very much an unbounded undifferentiated field of consciousness. And it is infinite, it's internal, all of those things that you always hear. So, when you're doing something in higher states of consciousness and meditation, it isn't just having a linear effect one, and one, and one. It's an exponential effect. And they have found that, for example, if a city of 200,000 people has 2000 people meditating for a week or two, -crime rates go down, -Right. Violence goes down, emergency department visits go down. And these studies have been sustained, and the reason for that is that even the people who don't know those meditators are in town, are affected by that field of consciousness effect. - So, when enough people... - Wow, that's cool. Yeah, that's where the magic and the power in this is. I want to get clarity here, we're talking not about what you're aware of, but the essence of conscious mind itself. Okay, that is a little abstract for people. The essence of conscious mind itself. You've got to, you've got to go one deeper, for me. Yeah, so I always tell people, it's sort of a Zen process here, you're hearing my voice, and you have your individuality and I have mine. And you're awake, and I'm awake, but the awareness, itself, is a singularity. It's one field. Now, we trap it in our egos, and our intellect. - It's different than thought isn't it? - Yes. What I'm thinking is different from the fact that... No, that thought emerges from the consciousness field. But, I'm talking about the deepest level of quiet conscious mind. This is why the father of Quantum Mechanics and Particle Wave theory, Erwin Schrodinger said, the total number of minds in the universe is one. It's a singularity. This is a quantum physicist. So, this has been pretty well established scientifically, and the work of Dr. John at Princeton, where he put people in front of random number generators, just spitting out zeroes and ones, quantum machines. And if they put their awareness on it, and say, " We want it to put out more zeroes." It does. And if there are two people that love each other, it's exponential. So, there are amazing scientific studies about this effect of consciousness. Of just intending with the consciousness. So then, imagine if thousands or millions of people are doing something like this, it can actually cause a huge shift in civilization by people who don't even know you're doing it. Now, in ancient times, in Sanskrit, and the Vedas in India, which, by the way, are not... they predate Hinduism and Buddhism, they're very ancient philosophical books. And I've been a student of that since I was 18. And what you find is... when people understand consciousness at this level, they can then have all kinds of abilities unfold. Such as being able to see the future. Communicate telepathically. Telekinesis. Lift things with your thought. Um, etcetera and so on. So these are known as siddhis, S-I-D-D-H-I-S. And all kinds of people over this millennia of human history have had experiences in deep consciousness, and suddenly found themselves levitating, or found themselves doing something extraordinary that shouldn't be possible. Well, now we're discovering that the reason for that is that this consciousness field is integrated in its fullness at every point and space in time. So, if you're in a deep state of consciousness, you can affect a camera, or you can affect a remote place. Someone can be healed by a group of people, praying and meditating from afar. It is so mind blowing to think that we're all connected by consciousness. And as we got deeper, and deeper into exploring the CE5 protocols, I could actually start to feel this collective consciousness that Dr. Greer had been telling us about. Now, let us affirm that the mantra, and gently be repeated like a tone, a song in the back of our awareness. As we become aware of pure consciousness, this ocean of mind that has been observing the mantra. And as we observe the mantra, let us create an astral vehicle in which we can explore the cosmos. And the mantra, through its tonality, makes a perfect equilateral triangle. And as we repeat it three times, it will make a tetrahedron, a three dimensional object with a triangle on each side and a triangular base. Let's do that together. And see this beautiful, golden triangle. A tetrahedron. A sacred form, made of the vibration of the mantra. Now let's repeat the mantra three more times, and make another tetrahedron joined at the base of the first one. And now let's rotate these two tetrahedrons and merge them half way within each other. And we will see we have an eight pointed Merkaba. A spherical object with eight points made up of two perfect tetrahedrons. And now let us put our awareness in the center of this Merkaba. This double tetrahedral shape. And as we rest our consciousness altogether in it, we see it creates a zone of peace and safety. Our own astral vehicle, that we can center our awareness within, and travel throughout the cosmos and throughout other dimensions. So let all of us together now, see this Merkaba, and expand it. And as it grows in size, all of us fit within it. And all of our pure conscious minds, become the one that they really are. And thus we are one mind, moving through many people. The true nature of conscious life. And in this state, we can see and feel the awareness of everyone around us. And while each person is unique, in its own creation, and no two people or beings in the cosmos are identical. The consciousness whereby we are awake is a singularity. One mind through all people. And thus, with this eye of oneness centered within the Merkaba, we feel the love and the peace of being together. Before we are many, we are one. In this state of peace and enlightenment, we allow our minds to expand the Merkaba, and it spreads out over the space around us, and expands like a crystal expanding, and we are within it, gazing over the territory below. And so it rises upward into the sky above us, with our awareness in it. And we can scan the countryside, and the mountains and the desert, or wheresoever we wish to see, and we see with the crystal clear celestial vision. So as we expand the Merkaba, we allow it to envelope the entirety of the space above this place, or wherever you are, and you can gaze back at yourself and your team in their bodies, sitting. And you can just practice seeing from above, even while you're still in your physical bodies. And as you get a sense or a glimpse of that, allow it now to expand and rise into sky, and Father sky is enveloping Mother earth. And in their union they have created humanity. The second night, we were really deep in meditation again, and everyone started screaming and I opened my eyes and there's this bright orb above us, and it was incredible. It was my first sighting. My understanding of their purpose in visiting us and being with us, is that they understand this upper spectrum of consciousness. They understand the oneness of consciousness, so they see aspects of themselves in us, and it hurts them to see what we're doing to each other. Okay, so we're humans. We're currently in a collective consensus of warfare, of all sorts of terrible, terrible things. We cannot relate to a consciousness that is, 100,000-200,000 years more advanced than us. There's plenty of them out there. There has to be. The edge of the universe, right? Unless we look at things from a non-human perspective. How do we do that? Well, we have to deconstruct what we think it means to be human, and move beyond this spectrum. So we step up and we do that with, you know, through lucid dream experiences, out of body experiences, near death experiences, through deep meditation. There's all sorts of modalities where we can, you know, extend into these other parameters and actually just remove these limitations of, you know, a paradigm that's been around for far too long, and it's been proven not to work over and over and over again. All of humanity is like the mouse on the wheel right now, going, "When's it going to change?" It's like, well, "Just get off the wheel." It really makes me pause and think about my own relationship with nature, and the role that I have personally played in this cycle of destruction. The first thing that got me so excited about CE-5 and experiencing the phenomena were these amazing photos that Dr Greer had started publishing. These photos showed me that it wasn't about seeing flying saucer or orbs floating in the sky. It was about the beings themselves, who are occupying the craft. Wow. Yeah. I had a night scope on it, and it turned and curved towards this object, that was not a meteorite or meteor. It came in and curved to this, that just turned red, by the way. If there is monitoring of the area by intelligence or military, they could be hovering right outside the circle of people. But they wouldn't be visible to the naked eye. But interestingly, these new digital cameras with their CCDs or light cells, will pick them up if you have the right settings turned on. I'm Justice, from Arlington, Texas. During expeditions, I'll do a lot of the photography and the satellite charts and take pictures at the CE-5 events, and those pictures will end up being 3000 pictures a night, sometimes, that we take. And we try to cover as much of the sky as possible, as much of the time as possible, constantly shooting every ten seconds, a photo. So that's what we're learning to do. We call it trans-dimensional photography and videography. As we continued our journey in Oracle, to better understand the protocols and processes that are used to make contact, we caught up with one of Dr Greer's team members, Pat, who is often responsible for setting up one of the consciousness raising techniques used in CE-5, called, the Puja table. We do the Puja every single night when we are on these expeditions. There's a tablecloth. There is a silk cloth that goes on next. Most of the pieces that are on that table are brass, because most Puja pieces are brass, and they can be purchased at any Indian grocery, usually, or an Indian store. Dr Greer has a picture of the Ascended Masters, we put that on the table. There's a candle. There is incense. We have rice, water, sandalwood paste, which is basically sandalwood powder. And we have a little piece of camphor that is burned. We also have a piece of fruit, Dr. Greer likes to use orange, and we have some flowers and that is the Puja table. He has a very specific way he wants that set up. Each time, it's very, very symmetrical. It's really an ancient Sanskrit ceremony that really predates religions. And so as we do the Puja, we are putting the intention out, that the world will become the world that we know it can be. And that we have seen in our vision, a world of enlightenment, a world that is interstellar, and a world of peace. There are these two photos of trans-dimensional beings that actually appear over the Puja table, when Dr Greer is doing his ceremony. These photos literally blew my mind. The tones are one of the protocols. There are three protocols. Sound, which are the tones. Thought, which is meditation, and light, which is the use of the laser. The tones, he uses three tones. Crop circle tones, Fibonacci tones, and the CSETI logo tones. We use a radio to transmit these tones before we start. And we also play them for the group, we play them over a loud speaker. And it is thought that these tones can be picked up, electronically by ETs. And it helps to kind of, vector them in, and let them know where we are. I've always struggled to meditate, because my life is very hectic, and I find, even the smallest thing, quite distracting. Normally, when I'm looking for meditations to listen to, I'll just go to YouTube and find something random. But what I found when I actually started to listen to the meditations that were in Dr Greer's app, was that I was able to focus more, somehow, knowing that he was such an expert at being able to contact ETs and craft, and have them appear, helped me to be more focused on the meditation, and to tune out everything around me. So I'm sure many of the people that have watched your movies have either started to dabble in CE-5, or they are really interested about going and doing it. And I'm somebody that has gone out there and given it a shot. And there's been things that have worked for me, and things that did not. One thing that I have found has always brought on some sort of sighting, has been doing, I don't know how you describe it, but the reverse meditation, where you are in the Milky Way, then you're going into your solar system, open your eyes, there they are! So that's been really great for me. But I know that lots of people do lots of different types of protocols. -You created an app, -Yes. For us mere mortals to be able to, I guess, tap into what it is that you do. But can you walk me through a few of the things that are in the app now? Well, the key thing is, I think this is the most important, - most people don't... - Bring it out. Sure. And one that people don't think about is, "Why are you doing this?" So there is a sort of philosophical purpose behind it. I think that people who do this because they want to be entertained by seeing a UFO, are usually disappointed, because these civilizations aren't interested in being dolphins at SeaWorld, so I think there's, you know, it's like that movie, The Right Stuff, about the Space Program and John Glenn. These civilizations want people who are sincere, pure hearted, doing it for the right reasons. - To raise the vibration of everybody else around them. - Yes. And they are really wanting to do something to help the situation. You know, we live in such a narcissistic, selfish society. That has to be secondary to a larger purpose greater than yourself. So I think it has to be something, you know, and this is, I know, very unpopular in our society now, because it sounds so old fashioned, but I think people really need to be concerned about something better than their own aggrandizement and curiosity. - Okay. - Okay, so that's really key. In fact, it is the pure heartedness that someone approaches this with - that is deterministic, much more so than the protocols. - Okay. The app has so much going on in it. And when I went out and did my first CE-5, the only thing that I used were, you know, the cricket kind of sounding tones. And that worked for me, lights in the sky. But then when I went out with Greer, it was a completely different experience. I mean, he was doing a Puja ceremony. There was meditations. There was all manner of things going on. So, you know, what's going on in that app? Is it supposed to mimic what happens when you go out with Greer, or? So the idea was, that not everybody can go out on these retreats. They sell out really fast, and limited to, like, 20 people. Oh, they're so unattainable for your average person, for sure. Yeah, so the app is trying, the app was designed to, sort of give everyone all the tools they would need to do this on their own. Form their own groups, connect with people who are locally... It has guided meditations. It's got the tones that you use. Those tones were actually captured in a crop circle. - That's where they came from. - Right, right, right, right. There's the equipment list. Because, he said, I guess the purpose of the tone is to help you get onto the same, you know, mental frequency as everybody else in the group. - That's right. - So that makes sense. But it's interesting how you're explaining it to me now because if you haven't been out with Dr Greer, you literally don't know what he does. You don't know the sequence of events. So you having this app really does allow you to to mimic that. That's right. I mean, the first thing on the list is assembling a team, right? So you can actually connect with other people, locally, who have the app. What do you mean? What do you mean by that? Like how do you connect with other people? There's a whole networking aspect of the app, where you can meet up with other people locally, who have the app, and form your own groups. So like, if we go on it now. Mmm-hm. Okay, so there's our location. Oh my God, there's like all these people around that are like... All these people. And they're... who are they? They're people that have the app or they have registered a seat? Like, what does that mean? Yes, it's other people who have the app, and are interested in connecting. So I can, like reach out to them and message them and be like, "Hey, do you want to catch up and CE-5?" So there's now hundreds of thousands of people forming groups all over the world. It's kinda like Meetup, in a way, like a meet up sort of group. Yeah, and then there's a whole library of phenomenon and things to look for. You know, you want to make sure that if you see something in the sky, - it's not just a satellite. - Right. So this will help you identify the real phenomenon. Well, that is really important, because again, when we were out, a lot of people were like, "Oh my God, there's something," but straightaway, Greer debunked it. He's like, "No, that's definitely a satellite." Because he'd pull up a map, and you could tell that, that was the trajectory of something. Exactly. So you want to look for objects - that are moving in an unusual way, you know. - Right. And so the app will kind of give you a good sense of how to identify that. And also with practice. You know, it's always good to pull up satellite charts, and you get a sense of what's real and what isn't over time. Well, you know what's really interesting? People always talk about, you know, being able to identify what you see. But the things that I have seen with him and on my own, you don't need no one to identify those, that like... - That's right. - That was a UFO, you know. The reason that it's important for people to understand the nature of consciousness and meditation, is because all the technologies that ET civilizations are using, interface with coherent thought, and consciousness. You know, using something like our cell phones or these cameras, or the Internet, it's the speed of light. But if you're from a galaxy two and a half million light years from here, like Andromeda, at the speed of light, it'd take two and a half million years to get a signal there and another two and a half to get it to get it back. That's five million years. So we are dealing with an understanding of reality. The root of it is understanding this consciousness field, and that's what everyone has to understand and then begin to practice. Why that meditation approach is so important. And there are really three phases to it. If you look at what's in the app. Well, that's what I'd love you to walk me through now, because, you know, most people like myself, would have watched the movie and be like, "All right, great. So I'm going to do some meditation. I know how to do that, I'll quickly, you know, put on a meditation app. I haven't done meditation for 20 years, But I'm going to give it a go." So, and that doesn't work. So how, what advice can you give to people that haven't meditated before, you know, to learn some skills and techniques to be able to help them - Mmm-hm. - Focus. Well, that's why there is a whole meditation training course in the app. Okay. And, because ultimately, first of all, you have to understand what meditation is. Most people, the word meditation just means to think. But in this case, it's specifically talking about using techniques, so you experience that deep, quiet aspect of your mind, that's not limited by space and time. This deep Samadhi state. The reason that's important is that if you understand the nature of consciousness, then you end up having the ability to say, "Okay, now I know where I'm going." Because most people who sit down and do a meditation technique, they don't know what the purpose of it is. Any meditation technique, really should be geared towards the technique ending, and you sitting in a state of complete silence, where the mind is clear, empty, unbounded. - And now ready to... - And then ready to see. So that's phase one. A lot of people who meditate frequently can take just a few minutes. Other people may need to meditate for an hour. When you get into that quiet state, once you are in that deep quiet state, then you can intend, and this is more, a little subtle. You're still in a quiet, relaxed state of mind, but you intend to see remote places. So, and you're asking, in consciousness, where are the ET craft, where are their planets? Where are the ET beings? - If they're in the area? - Do you mean see? Or do you mean see? - No, I mean, see with consciousness. - Okay. You know, the CIA would call it remote viewing, but ancient people just call it being the way of the seer, your third eye. And so those abilities, you know, those grow slowly, and there are things we can do to practice that. But once you practice the meditation in a deep, once, you are in a quiet state. Then you intend to see, ask, "Where are the craft? Where are the ET beings?" And then become silent, and see what pops into your awareness. And so is that what's been happening, to me, when I hear, "turned around, over here, 45 degrees." Okay. And everyone gets this differently. Some people will be visual, some will get words, some will just have... But some, it'll just be a knowingness. Everyone is different in how they get intuitive knowledge. But then once that happens, then the third phase is, let's say you're, you know, seeing way out in our solar system, by Saturn, and you see this ET spacecraft, and the occupants. Well, then you want to guide them from Saturn to the Earth. And let's say, if you are out in the desert of Arizona, you kind of zoom in mentally. You're trying to show them visually, "Here is where we are," boom. I describe it to... the group that I was doing a guided meditation for, I described it as Google Earth. Sure. Same thing. Is that, is that, is that the visual, though, seeing that... There's America now, there's California now, there's... You start out doing it that way. But what evolves eventually is that you actually are out there. Like Ingo Swann, he would actually go out to Saturn, you know, the CIA remote viewer. -But if you do that, I guess, enough times, -Yes. Your brain becomes, or your consciousness becomes, more and more used to the idea of it. And then you have these experiences I call over rides, where you'll be in that state, suddenly, you'll see clear as a bell, an ET face or a craft, or a console or their planet, and that's when you're staying in that deep state and connecting to them. And then ultimately, inviting them, respectfully. I've had so much personal success with this Google Earth technique, but now I am so excited to actually get to see how Dr. Greer himself does it. And now let us expand further into the space around the Earth. And the Merkaba expands, and the earth itself is within the Merkaba, and within the field of our consciousness. And as we expand this vision, we see that the entire solar system is pure consciousness, vibrating at a frequency to create planets and space. And we realize that every planet is awake and conscious, and that our solar system is filled with extraterrestrial centers and vehicles, awaiting the arrival of humanity into a time of peace. Let us stay in this state of expanded consciousness and allow ourselves to see the extraterrestrial vehicles, and peoples that have been assigned to Earth. And as we see them, we invite them here, or wherever you are, to be in contact with us. And we tell them that we are ambassadors of peace to the universe and to all civilizations, capable of interstellar travel. And show them our exact location. So wherever you are on earth, right now, connect to the spacecraft and to the people, the extraterrestrials within it. And know that with a clear laser-like, coherent thought, they will see your exact location. And so you show them the earth, and whatever continent you are in, and your country, and your region, and the place where you are currently sitting. And you just effortlessly zoom in to that location, over and over again. Until you feel they have seen your location. And invite them to appear, in any way it is safe and appropriate, for this time and place and for this group, and however they choose to appear, we express our gratitude and it confirms that we are awake enough and educated enough to see them, and know their presence. One of the biggest surprises for me and one of the greatest things that I've taken away from doing CE-5 in a group, is how amazing it is to be able to share these profound experiences with other people. Being with a group of people where all of your intentions are aligned and feeling that unity and that love in the group, is honestly quite overwhelming. We're talking about civilizations that are highly advanced. They are not using fossil fuels. They have super advanced energy systems that they have learned to manage on their own planet. Therefore, what have they done? They've learned to coexist with each other. Otherwise they'd be gone, wouldn't they? Well, that's one way of looking at it. And then, a lot of these civilizations are completely telepathic. They communicate with thought. We experienced that a lot. They respond to our thoughts. We know that that's how they are interacting with us. So what are they doing with each other? There is absolutely nothing to hide in their society. There is no room for hatred, for fear, for division, for any of those things that we experience as humans because we talk. So if you, if you're existing in a thought spectrum as your communication, then, you know what I mean? You're in a state of peace, aren't you? With each other. You've worked it out. "Oh, that guy over there, he keeps on having these bad thoughts about me." "Oh, I can read them, and so can this person, and so can this person." Imagine that. That's, you know... So, there's all of these, all of these other ways of actually really sifting through the rubbish and the nonsense and getting to a place in the self where you've had enough experiences to know the truth of our existence in the universe. I came here to do what I can, to help our planet, the nature we are of and from, and our species. Sent a meditation to the ETs asking if, you know, we could have a more subtle event, to give me some sort of visual in their own way, that speaks my language, so to speak, that I can use as, kind of irrefutable data that there is something happening between my direct effort, and their reciprocation of those efforts. And it was a physical manifestation. Other people saw it. But to me, there was something intensely personal that really impacted me. Dr Greer and the group have been wonderful so far, and they really emphasize not to bring fear into the circle. And they really helped me to overcome it. And when we saw the orb, it was just wonderful. It was, I felt really good, when I take from CE-5, with me everywhere else, is love and interaction. And when I'm with others, I think about things, and I wish that I could take everyone, and everyone could experience the CE-5. You know, because it will open your mind and open your heart, and it will show you that there's more than just transactional connections. You know, where everything doesn't need to be monetized. Everything doesn't need to be capitalistic or based on that, because we're not getting anything. CE-5, you know, you aren't going to get riches from contact, you know, but you're going to get fulfillment. People really have to understand that there is this mass effect, when a fairly small number, and the magic number is one percent, apparently. And that's actually born out of quantum physics. So seven billion is how much? Seven million or seventy million? - It's 70. - Seventy. - Yeah. - Okay. - So it's a seventy to eighty million. - So we need seventy - Totally doable. - Million people to make that happen, then we should be fine. Wow. - So that's... - So is that, is that a goal for you, to get into the sort of circumstances where we could have seventy million people, just like we have Earth Hour, have seventy million people, all at once, - Doing CE-5, yes. - Doing CE-5. - And that's building. - Ohhh! And so, I think it's something completely attainable. Yeah, I agree. And it's one in a hundred people. And it may be less, because if enough people are in a deep and powerful state of consciousness, then I think there is a better chance that it can be half that. But it's something that's doable. And you know, the studies have been done. You have cool goals, Dr Greer. That's a really cool goal. Yeah, well, it's how transformation happens on a planet. - Yeah. - It happens first in consciousness. And so, is the goal, I guess, to move people from a 3D state, which most people are bumbling around, into a four, to even a 5D state by doing... - Yes. - Wow. Because the primacy, I always say, the prime changing effect is always the consciousness behind anything. Back in LA, some friends and I decided to do a CE-5 of our own. We gathered into Topanga Canyon, and waited for the sun to set. We made some sacred music to set the scene. And I led everyone in a guided meditation and visualization. It could just be our eyes, but it feels like it's moving, like up and down, left and right. Even though we're not exactly sure what we saw, we all felt connected to a love bigger than ourselves. Being part of the CE-5 movement has quite honestly, completely changed my life. The friends that I've made, the knowledge that we've shared with each other, the things that we've seen, that we continue to see, and our true belief, that the more that we do CE-5 together, the more that these beings and these craft are going to keep showing up, and the safer the environment we're going to create for them, is going to become. It's so exciting. Something amazing is happening in this world, for some reason. In 2022, these crafts have decided that they feel comfortable enough to be coming to Earth all the time, every single day, all around the world and appearing to so many people that are doing CE-5. They're coming here to help us and God knows, we really need it right now. So all I can say to you is, if you believe that there's something greater out there in this world for you, than just being a human being walking around on this planet, then you need to get the app, start doing CE-5, meet other people, make friends, share your thoughts and dreams with them, and start looking up at the sky.
