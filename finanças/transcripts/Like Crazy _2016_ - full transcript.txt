LIKE CRAZY PISTOIA, TUSCANY MAY 2014 Mauro, did you not see the ladies? Shut off the tractor. The ladies are behind you with the peat. - Put it on the cart. - Thanks. Sure thing, a little kindness... Have some decency, close your legs. Moira! I'll do it. In line, get in. No, Giovanna, sit up front or you'll puke on us. - Right or left foot first? - Right foot. - Sorry. - No problem. - Where are you going? - The cosmetics shop. - Beatrice, be a good girl. - I need sunscreen... I'd go alone but I don't drive. Hands off! This is no way to win me over... You're right, Beatrice, I'm fond of you. Thanks. There you are, sweetie! Come here, my love! - What do you need today? - Sunscreen. It breaks my heart having to repeat this every time, but you know we can't let you out, you're under restraining orders and must respect the therapeutic plan. I thought you were smarter than this. You know I'm the victim of legal actions taken by deadbeats interested in getting their hands on my money. You have two definitive convictions. They won the case thanks to the sectarian Commie judges. Everyone knows that! I can relate to our poor Prime Minister. - Ex, luckily. - They all betrayed him. Even the nuns say he's a pig but he's an exquisite man. I went on his yacht in Sardinia with Pierluigi, as you know... He's a kind, generous man. And I won't be silenced, he's a man who gives and gives. Listen, I'm fond of you. Really fond of you. Really. - Thanks. - You're welcome. But you must learn to get along with the other guests. - Meaning? - Learn to be accepting of differences. Try at least. If you're referring to that nutcase Moira you placed in my room, I beg to differ. You want me to help you because you're not capable of handling her obsessive-compulsive disorders. But I have other things to do, I can't. Would you prefer Annapaola instead? But she's in regression... Do I look like Mother Teresa? You would be placing a huge burden upon me... How can I take care of Annapaola? I reviewed your drug therapy plan, you're mixing up your meds. I want to meet you halfway, darling, but I cannot give you your own room. I cannot allow that. - Who is it? - A new girl. - Luca, how are you? - Fine. Torrigiani from social services. My colleague, Dr. Luca Moroni. - Here is her file. - This is for me. Welcome. How are you? - She has a brace but can walk. - Are you sure? Nice and slow. - Thanks, sorry. - No worries. Isn't this a lovely place? Like it? - Thanks. - How was the ride? You'll be fine here. We had to sedate her. Luisanna, the head nurse. Morning, I'll go make up the bed. Suicide attempt in detention? Mind your fucking business. Such elegant reserve on behalf of the staff. I'll hold this while you do the stairs. - Thanks. - Need a hand? Bad girl, you mustn't do things like this! You're all my guests, my family donated this villa! - Yes, I know... - Show some respect. You shouldn't look at other patients' files! - This is my home, understand? - Calm down. I'm too democratic... - Don't be mean, Beatrice! - You ugly paupers... Excuse me, are you the doctor? - Yes. - I was told to wait here for you. - Of course... - Sorry. - Thanks. - No need to get up. Donatella Morelli, correct? - What happened to your leg? - I fell down the stairs. - Fell or threw yourself down? - Fell. Drug use? Heroin, cocaine? Hash? MDM... that stuff people use nowadays... - That makes you kiss everyone. - Me? No. Very well, let's check your blood pressure. - Blood pressure? - Yes. I don't have your drug therapy plan here but judging by your thinness, you're not taking neuroleptics. Promazine, 30 mg. Anorectic depressogenic side effects. Any lithium? Citalopram, 40 mg. 30-40 drops alternated with Promazine depending on the doctor. What a disaster! All right, benzodiazepine... obviously. 2 mg of Valium three times a day. 30-40 drops of clorazepam before bed. I love that stuff. I take an antipsychotic, Haloperidol. It made me fat, gave me a real belly... I'm kidding, just trying to break the ice! I fell for it, doc. - May I ask you a question? - Of course. I sent a request to the tutelary judge. A written request... Over a year ago, but I never got a reply. Do you think I should resubmit it? Well, depends on what your request was. Maybe I wrote it shoddily. Will you help me? Certainly. The nature of your request? I'd like a photo at least. A photo of... Of Elia! Of Elia? Your son? All right, ready. It's off... they always turn everything off. Move around my things... it's so bothersome. Beatrice, we agreed you'd go socialize in the tea corner. - Go on. - I'm socializing here. No, you're meddling. Come on! Sorry I'm late, I was looking at your file. I can still help you. Miss Morelli, good morning. I'm Torrigiani, your social worker. - I'd take her off neuroleptics. - Thanks. Don't flub things up. - Is this everything? - My flashlight... It's here. Flashlight, cell phone, headphones. Meal time! Grub's ready, girls, to the dining hall. - Wonder what the chef made. - Something yummy. You've been holed up in here since you arrived... Come eat in the dining hall with the others. - Need help? - No, I can manage alone. You finally came, after hiding out in your room. Thanks, sorry. Protein, you could use some. I'm grazing today, like a goat. I've gone up a size. I bust the zipper on a Dior dress that looked smashing on me. If you want you can try it on. I have a bunch of things you could try, by my designer friend who works in Milan and New York. Short dresses, lovely but short. I can still show my legs but I'm nearing my twilight. But you're so young and pretty Maybe nobody's told you that before. Pity you disfigured yourself with these grotesque tattoos. What on earth were you thinking? What a mess. - What do you want from me? - Nothing, I like you. I don't like you. Go sit somewhere else. Thanks. They should've turned Villa Biondi into a luxury resort instead of donating it for the public good. A fancy spa with Ayurvedic massages, high-class guests, drinks at 7:00... Laugh away... The world's made up of people who want to be sad, the majority, and have no desire to work, and those who want to be happy. like me, I am happy. My husband is attorney Pierluigi Aitiani, you might've heard of him on TV, the PM was his client. - He's a genius. - Who gives a shit about your husband. You're rude and foolish too. What you need is a good attorney. I understood it right away. - Not coming to mass? - Who, me? It's a blast. There's a hot priest, African but sexy. Come on. I'll lend you something, I have the perfect miniskirt for you. Come take Communion. Don't we have to confess before? No need to confess. Stand up straight. The Body of Christ. See how he looked at me? - Who? - The priest. With all due modesty... I told Luisanna to put you in my room so we can chat. Go on... Excuse me. Step in the center of every second tile, avoid the cracks. Basola, with those big feet you'll have to take off your shoes. - No, I explained the rules to you. - Take off your shoes. You shouldn't indulge her, you should set boundaries. There's a chapter about OCD in the DSM-4. Beatrice, thanks so much. Shut up, she never stops talking, not even in her sleep! - Honey, I'll make up the bed after. - Thanks. I freed up some closet space for you. Wooden hangers are for winter apparel, the others are for skirts and pants. Half of this space is for your creams and perfumes. If you need a glass... Is that all? I realize you're depressed, but I hope you've brought a nightgown at least? Otherwise it'll be problematic having you here. This is all I have. Well good thing you have me... good thing you have me... Try this on. Stand up straight. - Good night. - Good night. Everyone's asleep in here. - Good night, Beatrice. - Thanks, close it please. "Judge Lo Monaco" Ma'am, I was sleeping. Sleeping? Too bad... I can't even sleep a wink, because I'm still in custody thanks to your incompetent verdict. Mitigated, my foot, they won't even let me... go to the hairdresser's. Oh please, give me a break. Go review the article in question if you haven't ever done so. You illiterate brute! Report me? I'll report you. I'll drag you before the board of Magistrates. I'll pay someone to kill you! Do you understand me? That's my phone! You called the judge again, at 2:15 in the morning. He already pressed charges for stalking. - I'm taking this. - No. You'll regret this abuse of power! Now go beddy-bye. Nobody listens to my advice, too bad for you all! Use mine. Not sure I have any minutes left, I just use it for music. You don't make calls or send messages? That's horrible. "To dad: I don't feel well, can we talk?" "To dad: sorry to bother you, can we talk?" She's rummaging through Morelli's stuff! - Anything interesting? - Ever heard of the word "privacy"? "Uzzano, Tuscany: hundreds seek out clairvoyant" Linda, no, you'll destroy the inflorescence! - I'm no good at anything. - Quit being dramatic. So I'm at the Royal Palace for the G7 with Pierluigi and the PM, when suddenly Renato shows up, he and I had just spent a steamy summer together... He shows up in the lobby of the hotel... No, what are you doing? Put the lavender under the gazebo where there's more shade. Giovanna, make sure to add water to the substrate. - So it compacts. - But then it'll weigh twice as much. Just make a few more trips. You could stand to lose some weight, lazybones. So I was at dinner with them, Bill Clinton was there too... He was very friendly... Hilary's a bitch, but he's a doll. But I couldn't wait to get out of there. All I could think about was Renato. We used to make love all over the place, in the car of course, at the movies... Once we even did it in church. There was intense Eros between us, so mysterious. Renato is no intellectual but he's an amazing lover, quite imaginative... Am I boring you? Darn, this broke off. Shall I take it to the kitchen? Are you listening to music? If you're not interested in my stories, just say so. - I was listening to you... - I can't stand hypocrisy. - I am interested. - No. - I was listening to you. - What a horrible thing to do. What was his name? Luciano? No, Renato. I've got nothing left to say. - Horrible! - Sorry. - You really are an awful person. - I'm sorry. I got confused. The city nursery is looking for two more patients to work part-time. But they want someone who has experience with herbs. How's the new girl hacking it, that Morelli? Not bad. She and Beatrice together make one good worker. Yeah, one works and the other talks... When it comes to plants she knows what she's saying. A bit of a slacker but knowledgeable. Do you think they're ready to go out? Beatrice's subjecting Donatella to a sort of love bombing, she basically stormed her. It seems the relationship is doing them both a lot of good. I'm in favor of them going out together. You're being rather Pollyannaish, this is still Donatella Morelli who committed a serious crime, and is a likely recidivist. This isn't jail. We aim to help people change. As Sister Pia says, we're sinners but God treats us like children so we may become his children. So true! I'd take it slow, someone with a record like Beatrice's... episodes of violence, she inflicted harm on a poor soul... let's take it slow! The poor lady was distraught, she'd argued with her Renato! "Her" Renato is a notorious professional criminal. His relationship with Beatrice Morandini was dangerous and led him to another serious charge. My vocation doesn't allow it, but you must've felt the felt pangs of jealousy in life. This isn't a personal matter, Sister Pia. Then we'll let Beatrice go out alone, so we can get a break! Luisanna, that's not for you or Sister Pia to decide. The judge will have the last word. Sir, are you ready to accept full responsibility for this? Shall I call them? I'll call them. - Wait for us! - Beatrice, get in. - I still don't agree. - Why? Bye! - Put it inside. - Now? - It's so fast! - Leave some space. Fill two, leave one. You should see how he looks at me. Watch. Watch... He didn't look at you. He's really infatuated, I brushed him off so he doesn't get his hopes up. If you think about Madonna and Demi Moore... - Beatrice, hello. - Hi, Giancarlo. ...with their younger boyfriends, I find it pathetic. Shut off the camera. I know someone's there. - What camera? - Shut it off. - It's not a camera. - Right there. - Stay away or I'll hurt myself! - Basola! I'm not stupid, you know! Giovanna, put that knife down! Please, Giovanna. Behave! Turn the light on. Liliana mans the pump, Daniela holds the jug as usual. - Let's get some Sangiovese! - No, I want sweet wine! We'll celebrate mass! A special mass! Hurry up. To the infirmary, guys. I don't want to go to the infirmary! - Stay calm. - I don't want to! Come on... - Calm down. - No! Girls, go to bed She's fine. I don't want to sleep. You hate me... yes. Cristiana, your meds. - Yours too, Annapaola. - Thanks. - Do you have water for your pills? - Yes. Everyone hit the hay now. - 5 mg. - Double spritz. - Smells divine. - Must cost a fortune. It's not sold in Italy, but give me your Seropram and you can have some. Now you can relax. Good girl, Giovanna, relax now. - The Body of Christ. - Amen. - The Blood of Christ. - Amen. - Serena Pagni. - Sign here. Moira Michelotti with two Ts. - Your John Hancock. - Thanks, good day. - Donatella Morelli... - Sign. - That's 120 euros. - Thank you. - Hello, Morandini Valdirana. - Sign. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Cigarette money. Beatrice, it's 120 euros! Where's the minibus? The minibus should've been here 14 minutes ago... - 30, 31 - Did they forget us? - Are you sure? - Yes. I'm getting anxious, what if they leave us here? Come back, it's dangerous! We'll hitch a ride. - All 10 of us? - No, it's not scheduled. - I've never hitchhiked. - I'm afraid of hitchhiking. There's a bus! We're gonna take just any bus? What number is it? 63, come on! No, not the 63! - Come on! - No, don't! Six plus three is nine, we can't! - Donatella, come back! - Thank you! Come with us! Come on! - How kind. - I'm afraid! - Don't get on! - Get back here! Thanks. Why not come? Get back here! To Villa Biondi, please. Turn around, take a right at Ponzano, you can't miss it, thanks. Lady, we're going to the end of the line. And where is that? If it's the end of the line, there'll be other buses. Tickets? Obviously not... Spontaneousness is always imprisoned by regulations. We've got cash, we're not refugees you know. - We should've bought tickets. - Oh well... - We have money. - Oh well... - Where are Donatella and Beatrice? - On the 63! I told them to not do it but they wouldn't listen. - Sweet Jesus. - Get in and we'll go find them. Sweet Mother of Jesus... and of those two! I don't see any buses, let's ask. Why don't we have a drink? Some green tea or... - All right. - Organic juice. I wouldn't mind a beer. Hold on... Look, there's Luisanna. Sorry. Let's go shopping, we have money. What lousy stores though, Italy really is in decline. What are these jobless people doing here? Sweetie! A lingerie store. Let's get dolled up with new bras and panties. I'm going to buy some Valium! - Meet back here. - Okay. Incredible, I found a marvelous babydoll and panty set! - I got drops and pills! - The drops are wonderful. Let's go to the make-up counter for some lipstick. - There they are! - Oh God! Get the hell over here! - What are we doing? - We're having fun. - Me? - Sorry, I thought you were American. Do you know where we can find a taxi around here? - No. - Thanks. Need a lift? Where to? Villa Biondi, know it? Take the 24 to Ponzano. Then straight up the hill. Don't mess up or we'll have to double back. Didn't you work at Seven Apples in Marina di Pietrasanta? - Me? - No, her. What's Seven Apples? I was a regular there before I got married, cool music. It's been a while though. Still work there? No, she doesn't work. When you got on your cube, everyone stopped and stared. What cube? You were with Maurizio, the owner? Maurizio! Lordy, what a horrific name. Maurizio rhymes with Tizio, horrible Those were good times, we had a blast back then. Then that story ended up in all the papers. - What story? - Did it really happen or not? Newspapers always print a bunch of baloney... Why don't we all go get a drink? - Happy hour at your house? - No, not my house. There's a clean hotel nearby, my friend works there... Quit pinching me. So long as there's a nice bar that makes good martinis, I'm in. Wait here, I'll see if there's room for us. Stay put. That jerk thinks we're whores. - No, he's lovely. - My foot. Look at these... "Anal Vision 3D". You shouldn't poke around in people's things. What are you doing? Can you drive? What are you doing? Be quiet, you need to be quiet. Hey! My Car! Not my car! Not my car! - Watch out for the bike. - We're crazy, aren't we? Technically, yes. Amazing, we have a car. We'll have a crazy good time! Let's go to the beach, to see Pierluigi! - Who? - My husband. We'll go out on the sea, he's got a 60-foot yacht. We'll breathe some sea air. - What day is today? - Friday, pay day. What date, what month? Is it already summer? Dunno, but I want to go here. - Wanda Ulivieri. - Coming! Oh God, it's Villa Biondi. Now what? - Shut it off. - Hello? - Donatella Morelli. - Here! Can you hear me? Hello? Can I come watch? We have to call the police. Wait till tonight, it's a harmless caper. If we call the police they'll be in a lot more trouble. Shall we wait till she kidnaps her son? What do you think, sir? Let's wait till tonight. But downplay it with the other ladies, because they seem to be a bit worked up. - Let's all run away! - I don't want to run away. And where'll we go? Sit down for group therapy! Listen up! Sit in a circle! Does he know I think about him? He dreams about you... and calls for you. Really? Does he love his other mom? Does he know she's not his real mother? Really? Where does he live, can you give me the address? Quiet, wait. I see it! He's crossing... a river on his bike. He's wearing a lovely red sweater. Red... Here, a swatch from the Holy Seton's robe. Go, my dear, we'll pray for you. Excuse me, I have something to ask too. Quiet, he often thinks about you but is still hurting. He? Renato? You mean Renato Corsi? Quiet! He wants to come to you but can't! Incredible! You're phenomenal, in fact he's under house arrest. His violence has deep roots, a troubled childhood, that's why he pushes you away. So true. The fact that I was rich and he's not always upset him. But it's a deep bond. - I can feel it. - Me too. Me too... sorry... - He no longer wants to see me... - Quiet, I know. But he's not well, he misses you! Hello, Renato? From a friend's phone. I just wanted to say that I miss you too. And I'm glad that you're no longer angry with me. And... what? I don't understand why you're treating me like this. Hello? Put it in third, then fourth, down shift before the curve then accelerate again. It's automatic. And with this guy Maurizio, the cube, newspapers, your son... what happened? Why don't we go back? You should open up and talk. Where the hell are we going, what are we looking for? - We're looking for some happiness. - Where, stupid? In nice places with linen tablecloths and good wine in crystal glasses, and polite people. That's where. Pity we don't have a cent left. - Where are we? - In Butthole Nowhere. - Where? - Montecatini's that way. Montecatini is glorious, we could go to the spas! I grew up there and won't go back. Let's find a bank, an ATM. How do you put it into first gear? It's automatic, understand? You're so thick! Good evening. We're closing. I need to see the manager, it's urgent. You are...? Maria Beatrice Morandini Valdirana, the Countess. The manager must know me, we're important account holders here. - I'm the manager. - Good evening. My colleague and I, she's just waiting outside, have run into a little problem I'd like to explain. Go ahead. We're guests at a villa not far from here, it's quite prestigious and once belonged to Marchioness Càstora Biondi Valdirana, my great-aunt. Due to some red tape... they've retained our credit cards, ATM cards, and such. And how can I help you? Could you advance us some cash, 2-3,000 euros, nothing substantial... I'm perfectly fine, you're the ones who aren't well! You banks are good for nothing but gobbling up the money Draghi and the ECB granted you! Let's go. - Where? - To eat. All I had today was green tea. A quick sandwich and back to Villa Biondi before dark. A sandwich?! Who ever found happiness in a sandwich? It's yummy. - Will you be tasting the wine? - Indeed. Corked! I'll bring another one. - Corked what? - The wine tastes like cork. You hurt his feelings. Enough with this social inferiority guilt trip. Servers are people who serve. If I'm not mistaken, the specialty here is shellfish. Jermann's screw top wine? All right. Perfect! Gosh, thanks, I appreciate it. Thank you. - To Tchaikovsky. - Who? - Tchaikovsky! - Rock on! ...So do you have any siblings? Before the mental clinics and judicial psych hospitals did you live alone? Sometimes alone, sometimes with mom. Do you have a father? Is he alive? - Did they divorce? - Ages ago. All the better. Mine are still together, it's ridiculous considering my father's a nance. A what? A fag, a homo, a butt-fucker. Sorry, I didn't mean to bring it up. They prefer to hate each other politely, it's the perfect passive-aggressive dynamic, a textbook case. I see... Tell me, are you on amicable terms with your mother? She works for a disabled General now. And your father? My dad is awesome. What does he do? Does he work? Is he unemployed? Pianist. How marvelous! So he's a classical pianist who gives concerts? - No, modern music in bars. - Well that's marvelous too. He was Gino Paoli's pianist before I was born. Now he has his own band and he sings too. Call him, let's go see him. - I'll call him for you. - No. Why not? I wouldn't want to embarrass him or ruin his reputation. You're not a criminal, you didn't try to kill anyone! What's the band called? Are they famous? Damn right, I'll show you! "Hurricane Trio". You could've just bought a notebook instead of using your body. I like it! Try waxing now and again, you've got armpit bushes! That's embarrassing. Excuse me. You asked to speak to me? Actually, to the hotel manager, a dear friend of mine and my husband's, attorney Aitiani. That would be me. Good evening, ma'am. - Have we had the pleasure of meeting? - How odd... I recall a tall man with a thin mustache, rather charming... Sorry to disappoint you, but I'd be glad to help anyway. - Was the dinner to your liking? - It was yummy. We've had a minor setback though. Some ill-intentioned folks, probably Romanians or Africans, have stolen our purses with all our money, ID, and credit cards... Everything. So I was thinking what I could do is leave you our car registration here, and come back tomorrow to settle everything. I'm not sure I understand. We're going to get it now and will bring it back here, in the meantime, give our compliments to the chef who never ceases to amaze, it was wonderful! And the musician is great too. Thanks. - Are you crazy? - Go, go! This is fun! Hey, that car is mine! Where are you going with my car? Get out of my car, now! - Ouch! - Ouch what? I won't call the cops because you're losers and I'm a gentleman. You won't call them because then your wife would throw you out... Get your stuff and get lost before I smack you! Pure insanity! How much for a threesome: me, you, your daughter? - Excuse me? - A threesome! - Hello! - Hi, gals. - Let's take the train. - At this time of night? We'll sleep in the station and take the first one out. Hey chicken head, know who are the nastiest, most evil masters of the world? - Multinationals! - She doesn't get it. - I don't understand you. - Forget about it... Are you nuts? Trying to reason with two crazy ladies. Will you settle down? Be quiet and settle down. - I can't hear you from here! - Chill out, damn it. - I like to converse. - Damn it! Shut that damn mouth of yours. Who is it? Mom? It's mom! Why are you answering? Yes, ma'am. I'm a friend of hers. - Where are you going? - To get them. I don't trust Luciana. Take Francesco and Giada with you. I can handle it, keep an eye on the other girls, they're shaken up. - What are you doing here? - Let's go. - You're here for me now then. - Now and then. Is that her? What on earth have you done? Villa Biondi's been calling me all day looking for you. But they're nice, they said you could stay with me tonight. Villa Biondi must be a great place. You work and they pay you... And how much do you earn, honey? I need some bridge work done, it costs a fortune. Even though I slog away for the General, I still come up short at the end of the month... Don't wake the General or he'll never go back to sleep. But I read the letter... - What letter? - The will. He's leaving it all to me: Luciana Brogi Morelli. No surprise since his kids never even visit him! Who do you think cleans his ass every day? Who puts up with his groping hands when I spoon-feed him? But when I finally own this place with all its heirlooms and medals, I'll be able to help you, my little darling. She doesn't realize how much I love her. A mother's love is all giving, never expecting anything in return. - Do you get along with your mom? - No, don't ask... I'll show you your room, if it's okay with you. - Luciana! - Sweet Jesus, he woke up. Coming! Sorry... - Come here, honey. - No. He'll be happy to see you. - He wants to see you. - I don't. He likes you. Can't blame him, with those perky buns of yours... - What are you saying? - Mine lost their tone... But I still look pretty good... General? Look who's here, isn't this a lovely surprise? No kisses, how gross! - Hush, he'll hear you! - Quit pinching me! What are you doing?! Darn hot flashes... Know why she's so sore with me? I didn't assume parental authority of the kid, like social services asked. I didn't know they'd put him up for adoption! You didn't know? What on earth are you blabbering about? Ms. Beatrice, you explain it to her, I did it for the good of the boy. It was only right! I couldn't raise him, I worked all day, she was a mess. Depression is a brutal beast. A real family's better. So you knew very well that he'd be put up for adoption... And Maurizio as a father... he went and fooled around though he was married with kids, and when this dummy got pregnant, what did he do? - Fired her from Seven Apples. - Enough mom, shut up! - Thanks, now get lost! - You hurt me. Knock it off or I will hurt you! I'll have you institutionalized! Go away, mom! Ma'am, I'll go make up the beds. Bitch! - She makes me sick. - Complicated dynamics. - Doctor? - It's Fiamma? Yes, they're here. Yes, they're safe and sound... I'll send them off to bed now. You can come get them, no rush. Goodbye. Can we get out of here? But quit pushing me, okay? - Hold on. - What? Let's see if we can dig up some change... She's coming. Your mom asks you for money but she has 985 euros hidden in a tampon box in her bag! I wondered why a menopausal lady had tampons... - She'll report us when she notices. - No such thing. She will, I know her well. That's nearly 1,000 euros, we can make it last for a few days. It's like being in Rio for the carnival! Let's ask someone for a ride and get a drink... Someone who? Oh God... No, please. - Excuse me! - Where are you going? Let's get a drink somewhere, will you give us a lift? Sure, lady. - Thanks. - Get in. - I can manage on my own. - All right. - Where to? - We're going to Seven Apples. That name rings a bell, was someone talking about it? It's casino night, with a roulette and croupier from Montecarlo. Donatella? Honey... - Not coming? - No, I'll smoke a cigarette. Here's some money to get in, I'll be inside. Wait for me! I want to dance all night long. Look at what pretty eyes she has! Did you have fun? Hi, Maurizio. Don't recognize me? Can I have a vodka tonic, please? Vodka and tonic separately. Okay, but then get out of here. - Hands off! - Get out or I'll call the cops. Hands off or I'll call the cops. Let go of me! - Can we get out of here? - Hold on, wait. Can we go, please? It's not fair, they're cheating. They're swindlers. Do you have any money left? I need to make one more bet. Do you have your 20 euros still? You blew it all? Give me the money I handed you before, I'm the one who took it! I'm generous and you're greedy! Give it to me now! Are you nuts? If I'm nuts then what are you? What are you? You're psychotic. You need electroshock therapy! Answer me, you ingrate! After all I've done for you. What? You're an old loon who talks bullshit! Big-shot attorney husband, aristocratic family, all bullshit! How dare you? You uncouth, ignorant creature! Worthless trash! Why did I waste my time on you? Be quiet, you're in withdrawal! Why did I put up with you and your insignificant life? - Insignificant life! - Calm down! Are you crazy?! I'll kill you! You didn't even want to see him! Grab her! She's dangerous! - I'll kill myself. - Stop! I won't go back in there! Move it. She attacked me, she's insane! - You should institutionalize her! - Calm down. You're a shit, you didn't even want to see him! A shit! Get in! A shitty life, a shitty life. - You're fine. - There's blood. - Calm down. - Take me to the ER. Right away, just calm down. Get her a chair! Untie me! Why've you tied me up!? I don't want to be tied up, no! You're hurting me! - It hurts! - Calm down. Why me? I'll stay here, they're treating the cut on her head. She has to go to the psych ward too? Hold on. - Where's that other lady? - Who? Excuse me. Fucking hell. Give me a second. I'm Fiamma Zappa. Lorenzini, head of the clinic. Where is she? We need to take her back. Not yet. Torrigiani, the social worker, is on his way. - Torrigiani, why? - He already called the judge. She's going to a judicial psychiatric hospital. Damn it, Torrigiani's an asshole! Why didn't he call me? He convinced the judge that Morelli's a danger. - After the nursery school incident. - He told you about it? Actually, we know Morelli, she's been institutionalized before. The head doctor agrees with Torrigiani. Psych hospital unless... She's not dangerous! She didn't try to approach the minor. Unless what? Unless her father takes wardship of her. - Whose father? - Hers. Floriano Morelli? But he abandoned her years ago. - Let me see Donatella. - Hold on. - She's with him now. - Him who? Her father, she called him to ask him to take wardship of her. She called him? You know what your mother's like... she's convinced she'll inherit the General's estate. Apparently, that old loon showed her some letter... She doesn't realize his kids declared him mentally incompetent. I'm in even worse shape. I play in shitty bars, and I'm drowning in debt at my age. They repossessed my car, and I've lost a kidney. A kidney, daddy? I had no idea. You need to help yourself, my darling. If the doctors and judge want you in a judicial psychiatric hospital, then it's for your own good. Daddy, are you getting treatment? Dialysis twice a week, there's not much to treat. You were so important to me. Important? Yes. I always listen to the song you wrote for me. Remember? You'd sing me to sleep. I don't recall tucking you in or singing you to sleep. And I wish I'd written that song! Yeah, I might've composed it... but I gave it Gino. My problem is I'm too good. - Don't even think about it. - It's not much. - No need, daddy. - I'm ashamed of myself. It's all I have, 120. But it's right for you to know how things really stand. Now I have to go, I have a concert to finish. - I missed you. - Good luck. Good luck, Donatella. - Daddy. - What? I'm really sorry for calling you. I'm sorry for always being a nuisance. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What a jacket. - What a shithead. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Let's find her partner in crime. - We need to talk. Thanks so much, really! You were sweethearts, bye. Oh God, she's here. - She's here. - Who? The lady! Aloha! No need to get up... Pierluigi! You replaced the couch with those atrocious chairs? What's that breezy bed? Looks like a two-bit hotel... Beatrice! What have you done? Villa Biondi called. I was going to go stay with the Albertinis or... Her drops! Or with Ippolita, or even the Malagos... But why should I be someone's guest when I have a house! - Aren't you glad? - Are you okay? - You skipped your meds yesterday. - I just have a little cut. I could use a nice hot bath and a good sleep. Here. A welcome drink! - You just showed up suddenly... - How wonderful. I'll stay in the annex, so I'll get out of your hair. Maria Laura put the children's things there. Your jaw's so tense, what's wrong? But you look good. Here's what we'll do... rest up and then I'll have you driven to the clinic. I'll take the blue room. Ines! Take me to the blue room, I had an exhausting night! Move that butt of yours, you've filled out... You knew she'd come here? Darling, I'm still her attorney. - Will you explain what's going on? - Nothing. I'll take her back to Villa Biondi. I must ensure she doesn't get thrown in jail again. So she'll stay here tonight? With the children? Darling, try to understand. Glad we didn't throw away your things. We had to hide it from her or she'd be furious. My wedding dress, how exciting! Wonder if it still fits me. Finally! A nice hot bath and an ice-cold drink always restore my faith in life. Stay seated. I'd be delighted to eat with you if there's anything left. By the way, what'll we do today? The yacht is moored, we could sail out to Giglio perhaps. Matteo, Amelia, let's go. Come on, Rachele. - Well we don't have to go to Giglio! - Mom, what's bipolar mean? Please stay calm. I'd even be content staring out at this poetic view. Good morning. This way. Hi. I just wanted to greet her. - I'll do it myself. - All right. I can do it. I really hoped I wouldn't see you here again. No stupid stunts this time. How's your leg? My leg is fine. Let's see... Get up, miss. I'd give her 30 more drops. Your antics made everyone uncomfortable. - I made everyone uncomfortable? - Why are you taking the kids away? I'll explain it to you later. - Bye, kids. - Say bye to dad. See you soon. Is it just the two of us? Why did you let her leave? She's sweet, she loves you, she's good for you. I realize she bores you but I'm sure she has good points. She doesn't bore me, why do you think that? Don't be so disparaging of the poor thing. - I love her, you know. - Of course. She's not like you and that orangutan jailbird you cheated on me with. You even forced me to represent him. You're beautiful. I bought it in a cheap store but it's rather cute. - Tell me, have you seen him again? - Stop it. I was afraid you ran away to go see him. You're so jealous! Tomorrow I'll take you back to the clinic and I'll have myself admitted too. Yes, in the special ward for clingy types. Clingy. "Donatella Morelli - son" "Rescued while trying to kill herself and 8-month-old son" "She wanted to kill her son" "The boy swallowed a lot of water and couldn't breathe". "Enraged crowd: she wanted to kill her son" "She has a past of drug use and mental health issues" "Attempted infanticide" - Are you coming back? - God no, this place is a drag. I'm sorry you're leaving. Goodbye. No need... I'm a big girl now, goodbye. - Where to? - Away from here for now. "Was Donatella Morelli institutionalized? Attorney Aitiani" - Mind if I smoke? - It's illegal. Thanks, so kind. How much would it cost to go to Mantua? At least 500 euros, ma'am. Make it 1,000... - Are you married? - With all due respect, yes. Let your wife know you're mine today. - How long has she been here? - Since this morning. Donatella... Shall we get up? Come on. Did she eat? Dunno, I can't spoon-feed them all! - Did she take her meds? - She's a greedy one... She wants to up the doses, says it's not enough. What would you like? Electroshock... please. She did a few rounds in Pisa 3 years ago and felt better. Why keep her here? Let's send her back there. Go get me her chart. Unlock her room for me. I'll help you. Thank you. You're welcome. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Come on, you can do it. - Wait here. - Okay. Good morning, I just need 5 minutes to see a relative. - Sorry, I can't allow that. - I'll be quick, really. Check with the office, I sent an email... I can't allow that. Are you a broken record? - I can't allow that, please leave. - So rude! I'd like to speak to Donatella Morelli, please. Yes, she's a patient of yours. It's boiling. I'm a relative... Yes. Her mother, Lucia... I mean Luciana, Lucia's my nickname. Luciana Morelli. "Juvenile court finalizes the adoption by Mauro and Alessandra Bonanno of Via Bonamico 52, Viareggio". It's not possible? What if I call back later? Perfect, thanks. Goodbye. Excuse me, I've changed my mind, a cappuccino instead of tea. - With lots of foam. - Lots of foam. No, leave the cookies. Hi, Snuggles. No, it's nothing. I only gave you 40 drops. You seemed stressed, I thought you could use a good rest... I'll bring it all back, I'm no thief! This is for you. You didn't get it from me, understand? Don't get me in trouble, hear me? "I know everything. You have to see your son! I'll take you to him! Meet me at Capannori, Lucca." "It's not your style but it's worth 35,000 euros! If you want to get out of there, do it Italian-style. Hugs" She's a nutcase. She's a nutcase. A real nutcase! - Who is it? - Renato, honey, can I come in? Will you open up? It's important, I have something for you. - Take this! - But why!? Stop it! Why are you doing this, honey? Your faggy husband swore he'd spoken to the judge but I found out it wasn't true. How much longer do I have to stay locked up in this shithole? I have cash, for you! I know you need it... - Everything okay, ma'am? - Yes... Don't worry, leave me alone. Let me come up for a minute. Renato said to give it to me. Give it to her? - Got a problem with that? - No... Are you in a steady relationship? - Is it serious? - The money... - Here's the money. - Yes. - I can give you these too... - I can't allow this. I know it's not my business, but we should get out of here. Who the fuck are you?! You can't take advantage of her like this. Geppetto, I'll find you! - I was going to pay you anyway. - That's not it, let's just go. You're a psychopath, you ruined my life! - Love... - Love, my ass! Don't use vulgar gestures like that with me. Drag in everyone who was here on duty last night! And let me know. Nothing. Thanks. Excuse me, I'm looking for Beatrice. Moreschini Valdirana... Dunno, go ask them. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Are you looking for Beatrice? Yes, she and I are friends. - I'm her mom, come with me. - How nice. That nutcase has parked herself in the guesthouse and we can't get her out. They want to shoot in there, the set designers need to prep it. No worries, she and I will get out of your hair. Good, go very far away. Is this Beatrice's house? In her dreams, this is my house! You can't imagine the havoc she has wreaked in our lives. She's an egoistic liar. She's been deceiving people her whole life, starting with us until she came across an even bigger cheat. That unspeakable creature, Renato Corsi! A real impostor who sold nonexistent property. And what did that dummy do? She lost her head for him, and he brought us to our knees! She signed anything that crook put under her nose. She got hit with two counts of bankruptcy fraud and the family patrimony was drained from all the fines. We've been reduced to renting out our home for Italian movies... Can you imagine? And every time she comes back here, repentant and dejected. But enough's enough, I have no pity left for her. She should kill herself and put an end to it. Go in there... and tell her to get a move on. Goodbye. I made it, I'm here! - It's you? - Yes, it's me. I ran away, can you believe it? Can you believe it? - I'm happy you've come. - I've missed you. I have a fever, I'm all achy. Nonsense, sit up. - My sciatica's acting up. - You'll be fine. It happens every time I come here. - No, these are slippers... - It's a zoo out there. It's cool. They're such clods... ...they put fake camellias on the rose bushes. Where's the other shoe? But those vintage cars are lovely. Let's go see him. Who? What do you mean? Him. You said you'd take me to him! You wrote it here, don't you remember? Are you blind? Read it! Come on! Maraschini Mangiarana, move it or I'll beat you senseless. Has anyone ever beat you senseless? Well, I will if you don't move it. Move it, ladies, are you in scene 38? Go to wardrobe, asap! Wardrobe is this way, come on! - Aren't you an extra? - She's a cutie. Francesca wants to start with the Lancia shot. - Got a license? - Yes. - We're actually leaving. - We're in the Lancia Appia scene. - Then go to wardrobe. - We're together. Shut up, dummy. I'm thrilled we'll be in a cabriolet, I adore cabriolets! Are you in scene 38 too? When we say "action", start the car and drive to the gate. Put her wig on, please. When we say "cut", back it up to here. Quick, before we lose light. Clapperboard! Easy on the gas, this thing really flies. Silence please. Ready? Camera! - Rolling! - Scene 38 take one! - What's that idiot doing now? - Making movies. She's no good. Action! You're a bunch of Fascists! - Elsa, you chased them all away. - I'll drive this time. - Cut! - Sorry, my bad. - Go! - Stop! Stop! What's going on? What's going on? Don't know, hold on... Hold on! We're out of gas, it's no big deal. Come along. - Down this street. - Where? You can't stop here. Be right back, we have something important to do. Are you crazy? According to some evaluations, yes! Come on. I'll get it. - Mr. Bonanno? - Yes. Hello, may I have a word? Sorry for disturbing you, but I believe the time has come to face an important aspect of Elia's life. - Our son? And who are you? - I'll explain everything. I feel Elia should meet his mother and hear her side of the story. His mother is here, inside the house. - Is this about Donatella Morelli? - Yes. Social services called this morning to tell us she escaped. Escaped... that's a bit much. Are you in contact with Ms. Morelli, where is she? I'm just trying to help out. You should listen to me for the good of your son. I don't understand, are you a psychologist? I'm much more than that. Never mind... May I have a word with you as well? Do you realize you may be committing a crime? Aiding and abetting. Know where she is? If so, you should inform the authorities. You have the wrong idea about her. I realize she can come across as someone who's shady, crude, boorish, ignorant, primitive, almost beast-like at first glance... But she's not. She's someone who is good, humble, loyal, generous, very romantic. She is fragile because her heart is literally broken. And since the accident, her life has been agony. - Accident? - If you can call it that... Let's be honest, the law is on your side. And if you so decide, you can impede Donatella from seeing Elia until he turns 18. You might not know, but these encounters did already occur, for three years leading up to the adoption. Yes, of course. In a municipal office, in a room with two chairs, under the scrutiny of psychologists and social workers. We realize it wasn't the best of environments... Yes, but Morelli violated the rules every single time. Because she tried to give him a kiss, to caress him... After the adoption became official, she caused a fiasco. Fiasco? She just went into his class to get a look at him, she hadn't seen him in 2 years. They assumed she wanted to kidnap him. But this upsets Elia too much. You know, when we got him he couldn't stand up, couldn't sit still... Elia, Giada, come eat, I made fritters. Then off to bed, we're going to the beach early. What did they say? We spoke for 30 minutes, they seem like reasonable folks. Can I see him? The wife has a different Tuscan accent though, perhaps from Grosseto or Maremma. Can I see him or not? No. - What did you say for 30 minutes?! - Calm down. There's a chance that they'll think it over and contact me. Contacts are important in life. Now let's find some gas and go back to the car. On second thought, I'll call Pierluigi. I'll have him come get us. So you can finally meet him! How does this work? You can ask for legal advice... he is a real legal eagle. Hello, Snuggles? Honey, it's me. I'm here with Donatella, my friend. We're on the boardwalk in Viareggio. If she appeals the sentence will she be able... Of course. He's sending a driver! We just have to wait! What did you do? What did you do? I'm fine. It's okay. Let's go sit down... get some ice in a cafe... You okay? We are, but you're clearly not with those outfits! A cafe... Cold beers. Naturally, I have some Valium I stole from my mom. 2 or 5 mg? 5 mg! A cigarette. - Why did I do it? - You sure are a dummy. Luckily, you have a hard head. They say I'm too unstable and they must take my son away. They, who? Social services declare "parental unsuitability". Eight of them come to get him, with police in tow. Poor baby's sleeping. They don't even let me change him. They put him in an institution, all by himself. For a little while. They say: "Just wait, we have to decide." - Who? - Them. So I wait. I cry every clay but I wait. They say I cry too much, and have major depression... "If you give him to me I'll stop crying." "No, you have always cried. - You cried at school..." - Me too. They know it all: I cried over homework, over my dad... - In the elevator... - Me too. I cried when mom yelled at me for crying. Me too. "All right, I have major depression, so cure me. - I was born sad, cure me." - I was born sad too. "Give me Elia. You won't cure me by taking him away!" In fact, kids instill a sense of joy. So they say I can go visit him in the institution. And I go there every day, all day. I feed him baby food, not meat though, he only likes apples. Elia and I laugh, you know. But when I leave, he cries. He cries like crazy. He grips on to me, they have to pull him off finger by finger. I have to leave him there, make him think that I want to leave. They say I'm not getting better. - I want to get better, I do. - I want to get better too. One day they leave us on our own. So I take him out in the stroller to see the Mardi Gras floats. What a sight, everyone looks at us, everyone's smiling. "Isn't he cute? His name is Elia. He's my son, I made him!" All of a sudden I see him... I see him there. Him, who? Hi! He's there with his real kids. - What? - Want to see him? - Look at him. - Get lost. - Look how cute he is. - Quit trying to ruin my life. - Just look at him. - Quit trying to ruin my life! He says "slut", and other ugly words. "You fucked everyone. He's not my son, he's Seven Apples' son." What do you want, money? Here take this, and this. Now get lost or I'll press charges, okay? - I'll press charges. - You didn't even look at him! I didn't want anything, I didn't ask him for anything, I just wanted to show him how beautiful Elia was. Fuck you! I feel like crying but feel ashamed. God, I feel so ashamed, I feel like a fool. I can't remember how to get back to the institution. I hop on a random bus. Then I get off and walk and walk... Fuck you! In the meantime, Elia falls asleep. I think "God, now they're going to take him away forever." I think about how much he'll cry, how much I'll cry, I think about how cruel people can be. No more feeling bad all the time, no more feeling bad. I want to feel good, we want to feel good. We don't want to die, we want to be together... forever. Later they call it attempted murder, attempted suicide. Words like that, what ridiculous words. But they don't understand a thing. While we sink down, we are happy. Luckily they rescued you. We're so tired, the two of us. We should get some rest. I'd like to sleep for a month. I'd say a year. Or even die... So my mom would finally be happy, everybody would be. Are you crazy? And what would I do? - You? - Good thing I have you. - Me? - You! - You! - Good thing you have me. You! Jesus, Beatrice, move it! God, there they are! Beatrice? Where's Donatella? Search the area. You can both come back to Villa Biondi with a new therapeutic plan. I spoke to the judge, no judicial psych hospital, no jail, but no more mischief! Listen to me, where is Donatella? Sorry. Don't move her, she banged her head! - Call an ambulance. - Hold on. - How are you? - No ambulance. You don't look before crossing?! - Don't move. - Take it easy. - Don't move. - No ambulance. - Any news? - An accident. A lady walked into traffic. Beatrice, get in the car. Giancarlo, help her. The ambulance is on its way. Give her some space, all right. - Isn't there another lady? - Right here. She had a pink dress on. The lady in the pink dress who was right here... where'd she go? She was just here. What a night, we had a blast. - Hi. - Hi. How are you doing? Uh... normal. Normal... Well, you look pretty good for normal. Do you know who I am? The lady who was hiding in the plants. - You know when your back tingles? - Yeah... That's me tickling you. It tickles at night. That means I think about you even more at night. I have sand in my bathing suit. Hey you, come in, it's not that cold! You're great! Where'll you go now? I don't know. I'll go somewhere to get better, so one day... we'll be able to meet again. I'm happy, you have a lovely family. Elia, come play volleyball. - What a drag, I'm so short. - No you're not. I'll come play on Luca and Tommaso's team! We're just late bloomers... Giulia, do a good serve! Serve strong! Guys, zero to one in our favor! Good job! LIKE CRAZY
