Don't, don't. Domestic abuse is real. Come on, hit me again Controlling a partner. Violence, coercion, threats, intimidation, isolation, stalking, Come on, is that all you've got? Emotional, sexual or economic abuse can't stay hidden behind closed doors Why are you doing this, you sick fuck? I call my collection the silent scream. Like a photograph there's no sound and like life the pain of the victims isn't heard I hope in a small way my exhibition can bring this issue into the light. I applaud the strength of my brave subjects, Chantal Bonnet and Emma Williams. Police are still investigating the mysterious disappearance of a woman, Chantal Bonnet who appeared in a photographic exhibition of an up and coming local artist, Michael Roman. The husband of Chantal Bonnet said they had planned to start a family very soon My wife is not missing, my wife has been murdered. If the police would get off their asses and investigate properly, I'm sure they will find the killer. Yes, we were planning on starting a family. What am I going to do without her now. Please if you know anything about her disappearance, please come forward and help us. The police are asking for the public's assistance if anyone has seen Ms Bonnet. I don't know what you're talking about. Yes, I knew her. I took photographs, okay. I'm an artist, understand. Just look at my exhibitions. How come no one has seen her since she was with you? How the, you think I'm responsible for every missing woman in the world? You look uncomfortable. Thank you. The husband of Chantal Bonnet, thinks you're involved. Ah Jean-Pierre. Yeah, I would totally listen to what he has to say. You see, if you had spoken to Chantal and you'd heard her stories, you'd be wanting to talk to him not me. What are you saying? Look at the photos. You think that's make up? You'd be the only one to know. Did you kill her? Did you kill her? I'm a little bit confused, officer. Am I under arrest or am I free to go? Because if I'm free to go, I'd like to go please, thank you. But it has been nice spending time with you. Hey Churchill, If only they knew hey. I'm so sorry. I love you. I love you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Put it down, right now! Right now, you stupid bitch. I love you. I'm so sorry. All right, Churchill. A pretty face can hide so much pain. Hey, Churchill, you should congratulate her, she just survived one more day, and how many more? Excuse me, hi, Would you take a photograph of me please? That's silly, isn't it? Let me give you my phone, that'll be easier. There we are, thank you. Thank you. My name is Michael, and I'm a photographer, and I'd really love to take your photograph if I can. Umm, I don't like having my picture taken, thank you though, thank you. The other thing though is I have a friend, he tells me I have a special gift, cheering people up. You think I look sad? Little bit. That's okay, because happiness can be in both our futures. Because I know where you're going, it's food isn't it. And it's Dim Sum, and I speak Chinese so you don't need to point. I can actually ask them. And if you say no, I'll just head you off and I'll get there before you. And hopefully there's no more tables and then you're forced to sit with me, will you do it? Pretty good. Yes. So my Mom and Dad brought me here when I was five, well not here this is a cafe, but when I was five they brought me here. We sit. And, I don't know obviously I'm, it's one of those things. I'm obviously not Chinese and then when I go to England I don't feel very English, and it used to confuse me a little bit, but now I'm like whatever, I am who I am and I am where I am. You live in Hong Kong? Oh, no, I'm just visiting. Oh. Shopping. Shopping, have you bought anything? Why not? There's shops everywhere, you haven't bought anything. Shall we get some food? Um, what do... I'm actually not hungry. I was just about to say the same thing. Shall we order some beer and go for a walk, I'll show you this whole neighborhood, it's an absolute shithole, you've got to see it. I just love this part of town you know, at certain times of day it's absolute mayhem. It's madness, but for what I do, I just find it really inspiring you know. What's your name? Sunny Okay, so you might thing I'm full of it, but, I'm actually an artist, a photographer, and I'm working on a new exhibition. I think you should be part of it. It's about emotion. When people to look at every single photograph in this exhibition I want them to feel a really strong emotion. So you want them to cry. Cry, laugh, what do you say, it'll be fun. I... I know, it's all right, I'll take care of you. What do you say? It won't take too long. How long? Well, if you have the time, a couple of days. A couple of days? Yeah, it's an exhibition, I need a whole range of things. I guess what I'm asking, what I'm offering is a ticket to go on an emotional journey with me. I'll capture the essence of you. You got a pet dog? No, do you? Got a cat called Churchill. That's cute, why Churchill? Because he has short man's syndrome and he drops bombs in the morning. Come on, try over here. What do I do? Well the trick is don't do anything, just be yourself. Just let your mind wonder, it's not about pretending to be anyone or anything and just to get you into the right frame of mind. Here's a little bit of bullshit about being a photographer. It is not just how we see the world, but how we see the people in the world. We're trained to keep both eyes open. To see things how they really are, or perhaps how no one else can see them. To follow the suns rays, to watch the shadows as they creep across the countryside. The crease in a face, the sparkle in an eye. And the look when that sparkle has gone. To capture an emotion, and make it last forever. Great, well done. That's it? Yeah, here have a look. That's you, listening. Lam Son, I've got the background check on Michael Roman. Look at these photos from his last exhibition. He says he's bringing awareness to domestic abuse. But is he? You know what, this, this just looks like he loves to terrorize women to me. I'm sorry sir, that's not being professional. The gallery organizer says he's preparing for a new exhibition. So either he's looking for or has a new model. A new model or a new victim? Good question. The report says, he was a registered psychologist in a clinic in Wan Chai until his wife died two years ago. His wife died? Yes, sir. How did she die? The report doesn't say. Dig up what you can on her death and have it verified by forensics, as soon as possible. Yes, sir. I bet he uses mind games, to lure his victims into a false sense of security. So, to look for woman that's already emotionally weak would make them an easier target. Yes, they would be. I don't understand why is he playing with them for so long? Ego, a power trip? Control of others. He probably strikes when he feels he's about to lose his prey. So as long as she's with him she's safe. But if she wants to leave? Game over. I'll go check on his wife. A Moy. Yes, sir. I heard you passed up a promotion to work in the special victims unit. Is that true? Yes, sir. Can you tell me why? Let's just say I have an interest in this type of case. Excuse me, sir. Okay, let's try here, you see that, interesting shapes, really nice light and you are the subject. Will you come and stand here? So, we're interested in peoples emotions. So to get that we need to capture the real you. Open, honest, beautiful as you are. Every photograph should be like reading a good book, you know you feel all these different things when you're looking at it. And every time you look at it, you see something you didn't see before. Excuse me. What makes you happy? I don't know. Watching a movie, fresh flowers. Wearing a pretty dress? There we are, got it. Wasn't so hard was it. I didn't even answer the question. Yeah you did, your expression said everything. I was thinking about ballet. When I was younger I wanted to be a ballerina. Can you show me some moves? It was such a long time ago. I don't remember. Oh that's perfect. Right. So stay with this happy memory all right, and I want you to think of, try and imagine someone has given you something precious, like a gift. Really beautiful, I'll show them to you later. Have you ever been to Western Market? No? I'll show you, we go this way. Okay, so we're just going to time it, right, just show us what you're going to do. Okay, perfect. Ready, one, two, three, go. Okay, yeah. Keep going, one, two, three. This looks so good, you've got all of this in the background. Looks really good, ready, one, two, three. You're happy, we've never been so happy in your entire life. Ready, one, two, three. So what makes your photographs so different? I don't know, but the secret is that the camera doesn't make a bit of difference. They all record what you see. For me it's a matter of learning how to see. How do you learn how to see? Open your eyes, your heart. Why take a photograph? What are you thinking when you take it? What do you want the audience to feel when they see it? Hopefully they feel a little bit more than they would when they look at a cup of coffee or a, some cute kittens or something. Well, you seem pretty passionate about photography. Hey, I'm a passionate guy. What are you passionate about? Do you want to hear some jokes about being a photographer? Yeah. What's the difference between a large pizza and a photographer? A large pizza will feed a family of four. And how do you, how does a photographer make a small fortune? I don't know. Starts off with a big one. Anyway, this was nice. This is where I'm staying. Okay, so, what do you say, can we do this tomorrow? Yeah, today was different. I had fun. Goodnight. Goodnight. Welcome to my world. Let's try here, I know it's a bit claustrophobic, but look at the perspective. Have you always been a photographer? No. I used to, used to work in a hospital. You're a doctor? Yeah, I was a doctor, but I lost a patient and it affected me. Couldn't go back to the hospital after that. Seeing all these people in pain, you know a kind of pain you can't see, and I just lost confidence. I just didn't feel I could help them. So I left. I mean isn't that something you get used to when you're a doctor? Losing your patients? This one was a very special one. I'm sorry. Well you do something completely different now. You could say that, but what is it a doctor does? What's their mission? They heal people, help them. Yes, help can come in lots of different forms. You know the mind's a very powerful thing, it can destroy you or it can heal you. And maybe when people see my photographs, it'll open a door for them. Help them see a way forward. I never thought of it like that So, anything bad ever happen to you? Something that made you angry, sad? Yes. Can you see your memory? It's okay, it's okay, it's just a memory. It can't hurt you now. Will you tell me what you see? Wait, stop, what are you doing? I can't do this anymore. If a picture is worth 1,000 words, what's a tear worth? Sunny, are you okay? So, when I tell you to stop, just please stop. Yeah, I can stop, but, can't you see, this is when your true emotions are coming out? What we just captured. I mean, it's real, it's honest. And whatever's behind that memory is yours to keep. But somethings are meant to be private. Yes, and sometimes if you don't face the past, you can't face the future. Are you okay? Yeah, I just need a break. Inspector Lam. Mr Bonnet, what are you doing here? Why haven't you arrested him yet? Stalking and harassing me will not achieve anything, if anything it's distracting us from doing our job. What if I find him and stop him myself? Then you run the risk of being arrested. You're kidding right? He's the killer, and you'll arrest me. There's no evidence that he's done anything. Isn't my wife missing, probably murdered evidence enough for you? No, because there's no evidence. This is bullshit. You know he's guilty. He acts all innocent, mister nice guy. He's evil. I can see it in his eyes. Can't you see? If you take matters into your own hands, you could well end up on the wrong side of the law. What am I supposed to do? Nothing? He has another exhibition coming soon. Look. I've got my eye on him. But we must be careful, if he knows I'm having him followed, he can put a court order on me and the police in general for harassment. If there's anything to be found, trust me, we'll find it. Now go home and leave this to us. Fine. But if anything happens to someone else, it's on you inspector, this is bullshit. What are you thinking about? Nothing, just enjoying the view. I don't believe you. You really think I care what you believe? I'm sorry, sorry if I'm a bitch sometimes. I just, I just want to get away, sail away, start fresh. I know. I can see it in your eyes. I had a boyfriend, a fiancee, we were going to get married. Then he hurt me and I left. Said he was sorry. But I just, I couldn't, I couldn't, go back. Sometimes I feel like it's my fault. Talking about it might help. He could be so loving, and then he would start screaming and yelling and tell me how worthless I was and how he could replace me so easily. And then he would apologize. Really gets to you after a while, being put down so much. You start to think you're not beautiful. Yeah, looks don't really matter when you don't believe in yourself. How long have you been together? 10 years. He loves me. At least I think he love me. And? And I left. And you want me to ask you why. Not really. Go on, you're telling me this for a reason. See if I believe it. See if you believe it. It just wasn't right, it wasn't the right time. I felt trapped. You love him? Yeah. I think my mother loves him more though. He's rich. He's definitely rich. He has companies, and fancy cars. And did he want you to be part of his collection? Probably. Hey, can we stop with the photos for now, grab a drink. Sure. Sir, I've got the updated information on Michael Roman's wife. Go on. She committed suicide. What? It says she cut her wrist in the bathroom. Are you sure it was suicide? Yes, sir. Thank you. Don't ever say I don't take you to nice places. Can I have your purse? So, I want you to wear a mask. Why? I'll tell you later. How do you feel? I feel silly. Why? Because I'm standing here in this silly mask. So, aside from feeling silly, how else do you feel? I feel safe. Why? I like to wear sun glasses, because they cover the eyes. Your eyes sometimes hold all your secrets, right? But here with this mask I feel like, I'm not even me, I can be anybody. Are you insecure in yourself? I think we're all insecure. But you keep asking me all these questions. What about you, what's your story? The more questions you ask, the more I think you're hiding some really deep dark secrets. We're not here to talk about me. So you said you feel safe. Undress. Here? Turn this way and put your chin down. Relax your face. Okay, Just come over here by the wall. Put your back against the wall, there we are. Just keep moving, and relax. There we are. Stay with me, please. Stay with me. There we are, you're much more relaxed now. There we are. Okay, Just turn this way and look at me. Just turn your shoulder a little bit this way. Just turn this way and relax your face. Okay great just come back over here. We're done. We're done? Mm-hmm. Well done. I need a drink. So, tomorrow, we start a little bit later if that's okay, I've got something to do in the morning. You know my hotel room is right there. Yep. Are you playing games with me? How do you mean? Do you find me attractive? Very. Yep, probably married or something. Right? No, it's not like that at all. I'm sorry, Sunny I can't. So I'll see you tomorrow? Do you find me attractive? Very. You're here. I had to. Don't ever hurt me. Never. Do you find me attractive? I love you. Lam Son, I've just received a report of another missing woman from an earlier exhibition of Michael Roman. Her name is Emma Williams. What? How are we just learning about this now? Miss William's family saw the TV report and they put two and two together. Let's go and talk with them, and get a search warrant out on Roman. Yes, sir. So, you feel any better today? Yeah, I feel pretty great actually. You make me laugh, and for the first time in my life I feel free. Like I can do whatever I want to do and be who ever I want to be, not belong to anyone. You see, the camera works. It does. You tell be a bit about yourself, where you grew up? I grew up in Chiang Mai. Everything was pretty great until when I was 10, my dad passed. And then my Mom to go to the city to work, and things got really hard. What about your ballet, you said that made you happy. Yeah, it did. It gave me a way to escape. But, after my dad died, we couldn't afford the classes, so the other girls at school who could afford the classes would teach me all the moves outside of class. Oh God, life has all these ways of throwing up big challenges, hey? It does. So, how did you become a photographer? We're talking about me now, are we? Mmm-hmm. I don't know, ever since I was a kid, I guess taking photographs I could escape reality. It's more than that though, it's not just escaping reality. It's somehow manipulating it and then capturing it. So somewhere in the back of my head I, I've always wanted to be a photographer. So, but, of course you know it helps if I have a subject who wants to go on a crazy adventure with me. It was pretty crazy what we did last night. Me stripping down to my underwear. I know, but didn't it make you feel alive? Yeah, it did. You see, the camera gives you an excuse to go crazy. Even if it's just with somebody for a very short period of time. Just Titanic, rule the world. So, I'm wondering what crazy things you're going to have me do here today? Oh, no, nothing here, they have security. But, it's the right time of day. Do you want to go somewhere and watch the sun fade away. Sometimes I'd like to fade away with it. Hang on a second, I'm sorry. Hello? Hello, Mr Roman, this is Inspector Lam... Ah, yeah, hello, hi, just hold on just a second. I'm sorry I have to take this phone call, I'm really sorry. Do some selfies or something. You hate selfies. I hate selfies. Inspector Lam, you know I'd really, really love to come and speak with you and your lovely partner again, but umm, I'm a little bit busy, how about next week? Mr Roman, next week would be too late, we must talk to you today? No, call my lawyer. Okay, we're back, sorry about that. He has a lawyer and he was talking to someone. I think a woman. Can't we just arrest him? We can't, it's all just circumstantial evidence, we need hard proof. I'll go check on the search warrant. Hello. Hello. Why do you keep looking at yourself? I see a girl, a girl I vaguely remember. What happened to this girl? She's changed. How has she changed? She used to have a sparkle. Now that sparkle has gone. When it was there is shined pretty bright. She'd laugh, smile. She had hopes for the future. And now? Drinks are on me. This is becoming a regular occurrence. Do you have a problem with that Nope. If I could take the perfect photograph, I could capture you all in one shot. I don't think I know how to do it, and I don't even know if it's possible. Talk to me. How do I make your eyes sparkle again? You can't. Am I'm worth it? Worth what? All this money he throws at me. Is that all I'm worth, just money. What happened? That was my mother just called. Apparently he misses me and he wants me back. It's actually all my fault, all of this. He just needed time to grow up I guess. Everything is falling apart because I'm not there, I'm here and I'm not doing my job right. Cause my job is to just be an object, right? It's not about love or a real relationship, it's just about using me, it's a, it's a business deal. Do you ever think about dying? Do you ever think about living? I love all these pretty lights. Just so bright and happy. And you want to be like the lights? Yeah, I can shine be bright and happy for everyone to see. And then switch off so I can just fade into the dark. And then what happens? Whatever I want. You don't have to go back to him, you know? I'm sorry, but my Mother's pressure is really getting to me, so, I have to leave tomorrow. What? No. Yeah, I'm sorry. It's all falling apart without me. One more day, one more day, please? I don't have a choice. If you leave now it's all gone, it's all a waste of time, do you understand? I have something really good planned, a really good location. Okay, just one more day. Okay, Thank you. I'll send you a message where to meet me tomorrow. I just want my life back. Drive me crazy. Stop it or you're gonna go back where I fucking found you. I don't care how. Don't call you and your mother. You get me so fuming. That dumb stupid bitch. Stupid bitch! I'm so sorry, baby. I really love you. Hey, dance to this. I can't hear it, your phone's a piece of shit. What are you talking about, huh? All right, I'll be your personal DJ. Whooo! Yes. You really shouldn't be out on your own like this dancing in the middle of the street. I just want to be free, live my life. Wait, wait, my drinks, my drinks. All right, stay there I'll get them. Hey, hey, how about a little kiss first? No, just dancing. Hey, I'm your personal DJ, remember? All right, get some of that down ya anyway. Get off me. Leave her alone, she's mine. Sunny, are you okay? Yeah. Why did you let him go? I didn't, he ran away. Well, I want to call the police. That's not a good idea. Why not? He attacked me and was trying to... I know, but look at you, you're drunk. Who are they going to believe? You. Well, they'll probably just end up arresting me for affray. You're a weird one, you know that. You don't want me, but you watch me from behind corners. I don't get it, guess I have a lot to learn about men. You're a weird one. Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me, okay, hello, hello, hello, just stay there, stay there. They still haven't found you, eh? And they probably never will. And they may have another mystery to solve soon. Hi, it's me. I think it's time we ended this. This looks like it'll be a good morning. I didn't think you'd come today. Are you all right? Look, I'm really sorry about last night, I was drunk and acting like an idiot, I was the one leading him on. It's just all this stuff that's going on it's really taking it's toll on me. It's okay. Just really glad you were there, I don't know what I would have done if you weren't. It's past. Just remember men can be animals. Yeah. Do you get sea sick? You said you wanted to sail away. Well, here we go. Hello, Lam Son, I'm sorry, I've lost him, he's changed his schedule, he didn't get on the bus, and I'm sure he's left the house. You still going back? Can we not talk about it? Okay. This is beautiful, I didn't know Hong Kong had such places. Yeah, most people think it's just a city, right, it's got lots of hidden places. And what is this? It used to be home to 500 Hakka people. They first established it in the 1700s. They used to make salt here. We won't go anywhere near there, the salt corrodes everything. Come on, let's take a few just here. Okay. Let's try sad. Sad. More. Good, come with me. Come on then. Ah Moy. Lam Son, we've got the search warrant. Great, I'm on my way. This is the ruins of an old church. Why did you bring me here? To get out of the city, and it's a great location. And they say, that if you seek the truth, the truth will come to those who listen. The truth about what? What you seek. How are you feeling? I've felt better. Put this on. Why a wedding dress? Weddings tend to bring emotions to the surface good or bad. Can be the start of something new or the end of something old. Go on. It's unlocked. Mister Roman. Mister Roman! Look around, see if you can find any clue. Yes, sir. Look at me, look at me. Look at me, look at me. Hello, hello, hello. Just stay there, stay there. Stay right there. It's really nice, hello, look at me. Smile at me We've got him. These photos weren't in his exhibition. Wait, there. That church, it looks like the one at YIM TIN TSAI. Exactly. Get us a boat. How do I look? Like a nervous bride. Come on, let's get going. Stand there. What are you thinking when you wear it? What is this pain? Where does this pain come from? Not surface pain but deep, deep pain? The kind of pain that controls your breathing. Controls your dreams? Don't touch me anymore. What hurts you! Leave me alone. Okay. Everything is fine. What hurts you? I love you, baby. You want to go back where you belong? I'm sorry, baby. I'm so sorry. What hurts you? You leave me alone. Why are you hiding? How can anyone love you when you don't love yourself. Why are you doing this? Be honest with yourself, honest with yourself! Please just stop it. I wanna go, I want to leave. You can't go! You can't leave. Go on try it, scream, shout. There's nobody here to hear you. You're all alone. Alone, wearing the wedding dress they want you to wear, aren't you? How did you know that? Are you stupid or what? You drive me crazy sometimes. Don't forget where I found you. He beats you, doesn't he? He beats you and sleeps around. Dumb stupid bitch. I told you, put it down. But that's okay cause he's rich. He's rich. Go on, be his toy. Do you want to go back to the street? Do you want to go back to the street? How you can be so stupid? How far will you go to please your own mother? After all the money I've spent for you and your Mother. Huh? How far will you go to please your own mother? Isn't this your life! Yes, this is my life. Who's life My life! I'm so sorry baby, I didn't mean it. Okay. This is my life. This is my life. This is my life. This is my life. This is my life. This is my life. Constable Wu, this is Sergeant Chow of the marine police department, we're ready to depart, what do you want us to do? Sergeant, could you head to Yim Tin Tsai Village please, you'll be looking for a six foot one Caucasian man, his name is Michael Roman, he's wanted for questioning in relation to a missing persons case. I'll send you the file. Copy that, we're on our way. They're on their way. Good job, Wu. Thank you, sir. Do we wait for your friend? No, she's not coming. Jean-Pierre. Hi, it's Michael. Yeah, just shut up for a second. Listen, there's a rumor going around that I slept with your wife, you know, I might have done, and I think you should meet me at Sai Kung Pier in half an hour and we can talk about it. Bye. Prick. Constable Wu. Yes, sir. What's wrong? Sir, I hope I haven't let my personal issues reflect in my work. What do you mean? When I was young, I was abused by my boyfriend. And that was the deciding factor for me to join the police force. Now that we're close to catching this guy, I'm just getting flashes of the past in my head. So I'm sorry it's putting me on the edge. I guessed as much, no Ah Moy, you've been very professional. Thank you, sir. Mr Bonnet, What are you doing here? Enjoying the sea view, what are you doing here? We're investigating another case, Mr. Bonnet. Stop him! You motherfucker, you fucked my wife. You killed her. Stop fighting. Arrest this motherfucker! Shut up! You've lost your little toy, have you? I'll fucking kill you! Shut up! Michael, Where's the girl? We need to talk to her. What girl? Stop playing games with us. Just show me your camera. What did you to her? Nothing. See, you're too fucking late. He's done it again. Shut up. Michael, I'm going to ask you one more time. Where is this girl? I don't think you'll find her. What have you done to her? I set her spirit free. You won't understand. Wu, call forensics, get them to the island. Yes, sir. Am I under arrest? Yes. Watch your back. You're Chantal Bonnet? Yes. And you're arresting the wrong man. I'd like to press charges for assault against this man here. You can't be serious. I love you. I was weak before. But I am stronger now. Thanks to Michael. This is bullshit, I've never done anything but love and care for her. Chantal, how can you say such things. Remember the photos? You ungrateful bitch. You're under arrest. Are you okay? Miss Bonnet, how did you know we were here? Michael called me last night. And yes, it's time to put an end this. You could have just told us the truth and saved us a lot of time? I'm a doctor I took a hippocratic oath. How about the other girl, did she just run away as well? I can't tell you. But all we know Chantel is alive and well. Can I have my camera please? Why are you doing this, you sick fuck? You want to hit me again, hit me. That's all you've got. Chantal, a woman shouldn't use language like that. Now be a good little girl and look into the camera. Look into the camera. How is it? Better, much better. More believable, see you've got to suffer. You don't believe it no one will believe it. Try and remember what he did to you. I can't forget. Okay, let's go again. You know, he'll kill me if he found out about... You're a brave woman. I present to you my latest exhibition, "An Emotional Journey of One", it follows a woman as she comes to terms with her abusive past and finds inner strength to face a new future. Victims of domestic abuse don't often see a light at the end of the tunnel, but it is there. And you can find it by walking through the door that imprisons you. Mr Roman, Congratulations on your exhibition, "An Emotional Journey of One". Thank you, thanks very much. Is it true that the police were investigating you for murder? Yeah, there was no murder. They don't understand what I do, I spoke to them and we cleaned it up. But the lady in this exhibition, her emotions are real, and I think by capturing those emotions, I've set her free. There's nothing left, there's nothing left. This is all I was given in life. There's nothing left. Here, dry your tears. You're a strong woman. Remember this is your life, it's not anybody else's I don't understand you. I'm a psychiatrist, or I used to be, until my wife took her own life. I'm sorry. She had issues, issues that I should have seen. I was too busy taking care of other peoples' problems not to notice what was right in front of my face. Could have saved her. Now I see the world differently. I see people differently. I see people in pain. You're free now. Be proud of who you are, and what you have. Don't waste your time and energy on people who don't value you. You value me. I could be with you. Now is not the time. You need to heal yourself first. Maybe later, in time, eh? These are yours. My boyfriend gave me these for protection. Yeah, they don't work. I have to go, the boat will come back for you. Take care. You okay? Where you want to go? Forwards. Dear Michael. Life is a journey, and I needed to go on that journey with you. It has opened my eyes to myself. I've started a new life. I hope your exhibition was a success. I feel much better now, really. I'm passing through Hong Kong at the moment, if you have time it'd be good to meet up. Respect always, Sunny. I've got some new information on the Roman case. This took some deep digging, but they found a form where his wife had applied for a divorce. Is there anything I can do to stop you from leaving? No. I'm going to bed. As long as she's with him, she's safe. But if she wants to leave? Game over. Now you can leave. Hi Sunny, It's Michael, so good to hear from you. Yes, lets grab a coffee. Where shall we meet?
