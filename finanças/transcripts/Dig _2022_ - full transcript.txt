I mean how goddamn long has she been gone this time? Three hours past curfew. See I am... I... I'm done with this bullshit. I am gonna do it. I am gonna bolt lock her in her room. I told her, I said I'm gonna nail the windows shut. And I'm gonna bolt lock her with a combination lock and only I have the combination, okay? I'm done. Just calm down, Scott. Don't tell me to calm down. Where the hell are we going? - Now just turn here. - Where? Right up the road. - I mean it's a dead end. - No, no, there. - Huh? - Go there. You're not gonna do anything crazy, right? You just wait right here. - Jane Elizabeth Brennan. - Dad? - Yeah. - What the fuck are you doing here? I could ask you the same question. - Chill out, Dad. - Hey, shut the fuck up, lover boy. - I'm not going anywhere with you. - The hell you're not. Oh! Did you just kiss my kid in front of me? Man, in some countries, I could beat you to death in the middle of the street then get a fucking medal. You understand? Now take your little arm off my daughter, -What the fuck... - Back the fuck off. - ...are you doing? Thank you. - And you, little lady, are coming home. - Stop! - Hey! - Come on! Why aren't you doing anything, you bitch? Let me go! You can't do this! Scott, did you have to wrangle her up like cattle? - Let's just hope she ain't pregnant. - Let me go! - Hey! - Get off! Let me go! - How did you even find me? - You don't think I track your phone? - Oh, thank you so much for the trust, Dad. I'm 16! - Sixteen! - You hear me? - Everyone just shut the fuck up! - Oh, my God, is that like... - You would embarrass me like that... - All of my friends... - You don't have a boyfriend first of all. - Take it down a notch. - Yes, I do. Second of all, those are assholes you'll never see again in your life. I will never bring... Kidding, the guy just cut me off! Christ! Let it go, it doesn't matter. Excuse me! That guy could've killed us, all right? - Jesus! - God, Dad. Yeah, I'm fine. Hey, I get 60 miles on this truck. Now if I don't... - Oh, my gosh, you're 60 miles. - ...get us all home... All right, silence! I'm gonna get some gas. - Un-fucking-believable. - Scott, do not get out of this car. I gotta get gas. Evening. How you doing tonight? You havin' a good night? There a problem? No, no, not if you, understand that we all live in a world of assholes, - I... I don't have any problem with that. - All right, I got it. So you're one of those tough guys, right? - You wanna prove everything... - You understand I got a family in here. - You cut me off! - Prove things to people. A blatant fucking cut off, pal! There's no other way to interpret it, is there? You cut me off, and I have family in my car, I'm just saying. - Let's take it easy. - Get back in the car. You know... you know what, you know what? - Hey, you wanna do this? - No. - Dad. - I just want an apology. - Dad. - I just want a fucking apology. - Yeah, yeah, get back in the car. - Dad, stop it. ...apology, I... Get back! Fuck away from my fucking family! - Hey, girls, get in the car. - You picked the wrong guy. - Fuck! - Whoa, whoa. Okay, okay. Dad! What are you doing? No, no, no. Honey, honey, honey, honey, honey. Stay with me, honey. Oh, my God, oh, my God, call an ambulance. Call an ambulance! Call and ambulance! Jesus! Call an ambulance! I can't hear! I can't hear you! Hey, doc? What's the word? How's my girl? Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Brennan, but she still isn't talking. It'll resolve itself. When? I mean, Christ, man, she's been like talk... Been like this for over a year. She hasn't said a word. - She said anything to you? - No. - You sure? - It's just trauma. But even her hearing, it hasn't even changed unfortunately. You know 10% left, 3% right. Oh, about that, look what I found. I found this cochlear of this... This implant thing, right? It's a implanted device surgically designed. This thing could double her hearing. I mean it could give her a shot at a normal life, right? Look, I consider you a friend at this point and I know you're trying to make sense of everything and I don't mean to be rude. But you can't afford it, Scott. It's $30,000. You gotta try it, you gotta stop fighting it and use the sign language. I mean, stop fucking around with the notepads. I know it's not what you wanna hear. You'll get through it, I mean, time heals. - Uh-huh. - Yeah, just practice, now. Hey, squirrel. Let me get the door for ya. I got it. Hey, uh... Hey? You sure you don't wanna go on that trip with your friends? Trip, your friends... I mean, it could be good for you. Come on. Hey, just talk to me. I'm trying here. About this long weekend... Look, uh, I'm going fishing. I need to clear my head and I don't feel comfortable leaving you alone at the house. Yeah, I know how old you are. Just, uh, you know, I thought maybe, we could go up together and I can show you where my old man took me. You know, it will be like a... a new family tradition. Yeah, okay. I better tell Pablo a couple of things, a little last minute stuff. You wanna come wait inside with me? Yeah, yup. All right, stay there. She hates me. I'm sorry, boss, she's confused. Ah... I told her go, be with your friends on some fucking trip, she don't wanna go. You just can't win. You know, sometimes I wonder, you know, what the hell would Linda do, what would she say. Yeah. All right, good talk, Pablo. - Hey, by the way, you have a customer there. - Got it. Hey, Scott Brennan. How can, uh, how can I help you? - I'm Vic. - Okay. Yeah, I heard you are the man in town to talk to for a strip and a demo, Mr. Brennan. Yeah so... I guess they're right. Yeah, well, I guess you let your work speak for itself, huh. I have a, uh, client in need of a quick turnaround. Oh, yeah? Well, okay. Maybe we can help you. What, uh, what kind of job is it? Oh, it's pretty standard. In fact, he even has a specific list of tools that he likes to bring along. We have a jack hammer, auger, uh, post hole diggers, and a wheelbarrow. So I guess we're doing some digging then? Honestly, I got no clue. All I know is it is some sort of fucked-up divorce thing. - You see. uh, my guy. - Yeah. He gets his hands stuck in the proverbial cookie jar, now the old lady is out for fire and brimstone. She hires a detective, busts my buddy. I mean, she gets everything, even the dog, even the ranch. You know, she's one of them feminazi types. I mean, she gets his balls in the blender and the only button she knows is puree. His plan is to have a crew come out and strip all of his fancy cabinetry, hardware, the nines, while he still owns. I don't know, I mean, Jesus, that's a lot to... think about. You say this is a buddy of yours? It sounds a little mixed up, I get it, but I checked it out with some fancy pants lawyer and it's all good. I mean, it's his shit, she just gets the house, so it's a... you know, it's a loophole, right? I guess that's what they call it. Look, uh, I appreciate you coming in, but I'm gonna have to pass. My guy is prepared to pay your entire fee and let you keep everything you salvage and believe you me, there is a lot of premo shit in there, Brennan. Tell you what, why don't I go up there next week, have a look around when I get back from my trip and see what, uh, see what we're dealing with. Damn. It's just, it's just not gonna work for us. See the client needs it done this weekend. Oh, well, shit, then like I said, I'm gonna have to pass. I got plans with my daughter. Well, that do sound like some good plans. Another ten when the job is done. Now listen, one more thing, don't touch the walls, just strip and dig, right? - Huh, it's a lot of money. - We got a deal? Hello? Yo, man, you around? Kinda. What's up? Yeah, we got a little problem out here in the desert. Oh, shit. What now? Please tell me it ain't that cockhound fucking cousin of hers, I took care of him. He ain't gonna say a shit. Someone's moving in. Oh. When? Think they start Monday morning. Sending you a local referral to handle this shit. All right. Oh, well, time's up buddy. - What the hell, Vic? - What? You said I could get the next one. Why are you in your underwear? Baby, I told you three, four times now. Blood don't wash out of shit. Especially colors. I have to super soak the fucking tighty-whities in bleach as is just to look like I'm not on my period. But anyways, babe, listen we gotta go back to the desert. - Fuck that. I ain't going back there. - No, I know, I know. But you know, it's a whole fuckin' thing. We don't have a choice. Let's just get dressed, come on, I'll explain in the car. I said, no. Baby, you trust me, right? I mean... Hey, I'm looking out for number one and why is that? - 'Cause your number one's me. - That's right. Now I promise, I'mma let you do the next one, okay? - Promise? - Mm-hmm. Mmm. I'm taking the boom box. Come on back here. Five minutes. Don't give me that look, Jane. It's good money. Spying on us, huh. You're pretty good with that lip-reading stuff. Look... this could really help get close to that procedure, you know. You're coming with us. A little hard work will do you some good, take your mind off things, right? Look, I'll set you up with a little, uh, sleeping bag inside the house, okay? Me and Pablo do all the camping and then, uh... we'll strip the fixtures and... I ought to take you fishing. Yeah? Could be fun. Okay. All right, let's go check it out. Weird. Pretty nice patio for such a shitty house. All right. All right, let's see what we're dealing with here. Jesus. Whoa, whoa. Hold up, kid. Wow. Jesus. All right. Oh, fuck. Looks like the utilities were cut. Ah, damn it. Looks like you're camping with us, kid. I don't know. Hey, don't move! Hey, hey, hey! - Get off of me, man. Get off of me! - Calm down. Take it easy. What are you doing here? - Just looking for somewhere to sleep. - All right. - Call the cops. - No! Or... or don't. Jane, the guy broke in here. I got to report it. Yeah. She wants to know your name. Tommy. My name is Tommy. If you're asking if I'm hungry, the answer is yes. Mm. I haven't eaten in days. Okay, son, we, uh, we got work to do. Me? Las Cruces. Yeah, warrants will do that. I'm no outlaw. Just stole a car. Just a car? Police came around asking for me, so I got on a bus, and that was that. Yeah. Hitched some of the way. Sometimes, jumped trains. Nah. Fear ain't my problem as much as loneliness is. Eventually, you get used to not being hurt. We ain't missing out on much. Way I figure it, most people ain't got much to say anyhow, and if they do, it ain't worth listening to. Is that your dad there? You like working with him? Now that's something you shouldn't take for granted. Never knew mine. Every day I wonder who the man was. All right, guys. I'm gonna have to ask you to move on, okay? I can't have you on my work site. Insurance. I understand. Thanks for not calling the cops. And the meal. Best you be moving along now. No, I can't accept that. Your hospitality is enough. Found all sorts of stuff on the road. Time to go. Here. All right. Perfect. So long. Whoa. Honey, honey, honey, whoa. No walls. No walls, honey. No, it's fine. It's fine, squirrel. Yeah, yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. Damn it. The one fucking thing the guy told us not to do. There goes all that money. There's no way that guy and his client's gonna let us keep it now. Scott, look. Holy fuck, man. We got to call the cops, man. It's a stash house. I don't know, man. They know who we are, they know who I am. Call the cops... ...it's a bad idea. Then what? I'm gonna go to town and get some plasters and paint. We're gonna cover this shit up as best we can. What other choice do we have? Just, uh, hide that. Hide it. I'll call the cops when we go into town, okay? - All right? - All right. Hey. Okay, let's wrap this up. - Dad. - Okay, okay. Don't do it! Hey, y'all playing hide-and-seek? Jesus. Hold it right there! Keys, cell phone, wallet on the table. Now! Okay. S... Sure. All right. On your knees. On your knees! This isn't happening. This isn't happening again. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Whoa, wait! Please. Hey. You speak out of turn again, and princess here gets it. - O... Okay. - You understand? Yeah. Okay. - Who is she to you? - Huh? Well, obviously, his daughter. Oh. And him? He's my... My employee, works for me. All right. Now let's not try and bother a run, 'cause I won't chase you, but her trigger finger runs pretty quick. Yeah, I hear you. Good. Very good. So here's how it goes. We ask the questions, and you answer 'em. Real simple. Well, you got my kid, I'm not going anywhere, but... But, but, but, but what? Why is her cheek bloody? Well, had to yank her around a bit, is all. She don't listen too well. That's 'cause she can't hear, asshole. Whoops. Well, that explains a lot, don't it? Look, just take whatever you want. Get out of here. I got a few hundred dollars in my wallet. You think we're in these stupid-ass outfits just to rob you off a couple hundred bucks? - That's rich. - Yeah. What we want from you is buried underneath the patio. Did you bring the tools requested? Yeah. You shouldn't have touched the walls. Man, we could have kept this clean. Why are we monologuing? Let's just cap 'em. Let's just fucking cap 'em. Are you... are you the husband? We needed the cover of a legit salvage crew before the excavation team arrives, you see. You fine folks came in and gave us the necessary tools. Now the neighbors won't bother to investigate the racket we intend to make out back. - I fucking masterminded this shit. - Are you done? - I'm fucking talking, ain't I? - God, why are you talking? Why are you stalling? We don't need him anymore. You don't do the execution while I'm talking. Hey! - Jesus! - Whoo! Oh. Oh, shit! Hold on. I warned him. I fucking warned him. - All right, wait, wait. - All right. That speeds things up a bit. - Wait. Hang on, hang on. Wait, wait, wait! - Here we go. What? You're gonna need us! All right, wait, hold... Hold on a second, baby. Let's hear what the man has to say. You know how superstitious about this shit I get. Look, I don't know what you got in there, but I can get you to it. Hell, we can manage just fine without you. Yeah? So did you dig that hole last time? You guys really know how to operate them tools? I mean, what happens when the jackhammer bucks on you 'cause you hit a rough spot, huh? That ain't shit, daddy. My man will just cut the wire and start up again. You guys done with rebar or steel mesh? What about brick ties, huh? Not to mention all them power lines you got running - through this whole property. - Fucking enough! Why are they still alive, Vic? I think the man made a pretty good point, right? I mean, he's certainly more experienced at this sort of business - than either one of us. - No, he's just trying to save his ass. We need to stick to the original plan and do the digging ourselves. That's why we're wearing this stupid fucking get-up in the first place. It's just gonna be so fucking hard. You said we needed a jackhammer, a shovel, and a couple hours, and we'd be outta here. Yeah, well, I say a lot of shit. Listen, clearly I underestimated the gravity and scope of this fucking undertaking, baby. Now, if you don't recall, we didn't dig that hole, Lola. No. That was your motherfucking cousin who we had to kill afterwards, okay? You heard what he said about all that fucking shit? I ain't about to get electro-motherfucking-cuted. It's fucking bullshit, what it is. - Put your fucking mask back on. - It's dark. - We're in the kitchen. - Oh, God. Baby, in less than two days' time, they gonna come back here, and they are gonna dig up what's under the fucking patio. You wanna risk going at it fucking alone and losing what we came here for? Listen, let's just put his ass to work. Them jackhammers are heavy as fuck. You're seriously not considering keeping them alive, are you? - Fuck you. - Fuck you. All right. We're gonna do some spring cleaning. That's enough scrubbing, Brennan. We're gonna wrap him up and move him into the other room for safekeeping. - Hey, what'd you just say to her? - Huh? I told her we're moving the body. Oh, and I'm supposed to just trust that? She read lips much, Brennan? Oh, I... Okay, let's try this again. Does she read lips? Yeah, I guess so. You guess so? Okay, good. Here's what's gonna happen from now on. You're gonna say your words to her loud and clear. Say 'em slow if you have to, but that's the only way you're communicating from now on. If I see you sign to her like you just did, I'm gonna play whack-a-mole with her hands. All right. Now, ladies, we're gonna dispose of, uh... Pablo. Thank you. Pablo. You two can go get to know each other, you and me, we gotta go to the truck to get our gear. Come on. What's that? An auger. Huh. What's it do? Dig. What do those do? What's gonna happen to us? Well, that depends entirely on you. I mean, I could give a rat's ass whether you live or die. All I care about what's under that patio. All right. What do you got under there? None of your beeswax, buddy. You let us worry about that. Wow... boys must love you. So I get you what you want and you let us go? Your lives for what's underneath the ground, all right? I'll even let you keep the money in the walls 'cause I'm such a good guy. Am I making you uncomfortable? What about now? How about now? What about right now? And how do I know I can trust you? Well, you don't. All right. Let's get to work. No, it... it's late, huh. I got floodlights. Do I look like a fool to you? It's past permit hours. We start drilling now, them neighbors just bound to call the cops. Nah, we're gonna start in the mornin'. Yeah, for now I'm kinda... I'm kinda hungry, uh... Does that daughter of yours, does she cook? 'Cause my bitch can't. All she does is get fucking takeout. Yeah, she... ...she knows a little. Good, real good. Let's start a fire, you know? And we'll all just camp out like one big happy family. You know what I mean? Let's make this a... a actual fun experience. You know what they call that? A net positive, all right? Oh, how about some coffee? No thanks. I meant for me. You'll have your girl do it. Coffee. Okay. You must really think I'm some kind of monster, don't you, Brennan? I don't know what the fuck you are. Well, no, you know, I'm just like you. You know, I'm a man that's trying to survive. I don't kill people. I'm a businessman. Bet she got a nice body under all them bulky clothes. - Oh, hell yeah, she does. - How old is she? She's 17. - Oh, I remember that age. - Yeah, me too. - She got a boyfriend? - Eyes off my daughter, okay? - Okay, okay, okay. - Whoa. She's just playing around, shit. Girl, she ain't 18. Yeah, you stay away from her. Damn, Brennan, I... I was thinking earlier. You were having your, like, your little moment of doubt and pain and you said something, you said, "I can't believe this is happening to us again." What'd you mean by that? I don't think I'm really in the mood for campfire stories. Well, let's try and keep this civil. I said talk, and be tender with the lip. No thanks... Vic. Ah, hey. Yup, well... shit, surprise. What the fuck, Vic? We're supposed to keep our masks on. Yeah, well, he fucking knows. Well, if he knows, then why the fuck we wearing these masks? Well, you wear fucking masks when you do this shit. Well, if we're doing this shit, why aren't we wearing our masks? Just shut up about the fucking masks, baby. Your much prettier without the mask, okay? Now that we're all intimate and acquainted, I'd sure like to hear that story. Nothing to tell. A year back, I, uh... got into an incident and we got held at gunpoint. Oh, shit. How'd you get in that predicament, Daddy? Yeah? I... ...we were out looking for Jane. We? Yeah, my wife, Linda. - That's a plot twist. - Wow. We'd tracked her down at some fucking rich kid's party and... ...and I dragged her out of there kicking and screaming, and on the way home, that's when it happened. One moment, uh, we lost Linda and... Jane ended up the way she is now. You miss her? I miss her every fucking day. Wow, and now here you are again, held up once more. That is like, that's like... like lightning striking in the same spot twice. - Fuck. - Yeah. Someone up there must not like you. If I'm being brutally honest, you do strike me as a touch... difficult. Yeah. I am difficult. Hey, you ever blame her? Yeah. But she's just a kid, you know? Well, no, I mean, if she hadn't forced you out that night, your wife might still be alive. Nah, that was all my fault. The whole goddamn thing should have never happened. The fucking guy cut me off, I... - I was in a bad mood. - Oh, man. Trying to be a cowboy and you ended up getting someone you love killed. You ever think what would happen if you ever got your hands on that man? Argh! I've moved on. I know what I'd do. Oh, we all know what you'd fucking do. Well, yeah, but could he do it? I mean, it ain't like squashing ants. Mmm, I don't mean, I don't know, honey. He don't really look like he got it in him. I don't know, baby. Be careful. People can surprise you. Oh, oh! Ow, you motherfucking bitch! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey... - Hey! Hey! Hey, easy now. - Take it easy. - Hey, hey, get back. - Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. - That's enough! - Easy, easy, easy. - That's enough! - Get your girl back! - Yeah, yeah... Get your girl back! I'll kill her right now! - Take it easy! - Yo, your girl tries that shit again... - Okay, okay. - I'm gonna kill her myself, all right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - All right, now get in the trailer. You gonna get some sleep. You got a big dig in the morning, all right? - Move. - Why don't... why don't you guys take the camper? - There's a bed in there. - Let you run off in the middle of the night? Nice try, Einstein. Get in the fucking camper. - Go on. - Go on, go on. Run, Forrest, run. Wake up, you little sleepy-ass bitch. Who are you dreaming of? Were you fucking that other guy in your dreams? - No. - Me? - Yeah. - Fucking promise? I promise. - Wake up. Shit. - What's your plan? Morning, Brennan. Beautiful day for a dig, ain't it? Yeah. Yeah, get yourself something to eat, uh, 'cause you're gonna need your strength. But, uh, first coffee. And you make it this time, all right? No more goodwill. Yeah. What's your problem? You're the one who almost got us killed last night. Hey, what I tell you about talking to each other like that, huh? All right. She's upset. Huh? Hey. Jane, that's not true. It's not your fault. Hey, stop fucking talking to her like that, eh? Jane. - Where are you going? - I know what that means. Hey, hey, where are you going? Hey! - Hey! Hey, you know I didn't... - Hey, where are you going, huh? - Kiddo, where you going? - Get back! - No, no, guys! No, no! - Hey, tell her to get back here! Huh. Fucking kids these days. Jesus. Shut up. Please, don't touch her. Please! Hey! She's just a kid. Vic! Vic! I just missed. Any closer, and I'd be looking through a little hole in your noggin right now. You'd have more holes in you than Sponge Bob Square Pants. I don't want that. So read my lips. You do as you're told, you go inside... or I'm gonna reunite your daddy with your mommy. You understand me? Good. Go on. Come here. Oh, my God. Okay, it's okay. Now, that everybody's wide awake... we dig. Oh, and that's a... that's a jackhammer, right? The guy on the YouTube video said use that to break up the tiles. - That true? - YouTube? Yeah. Hey. Say how long is all this shit gonna take anyway? I don't know. Not 'til I get in there. See what we're dealing with. Not much for a small talking chitchat this morning, huh, Brennan? Shit, I get it. You're still sore about what happened back there with your daughter? What can I say, she just... keeps getting into trouble, doesn't she? You can try... but... You know, I like you, Brennan, I really do. I don't wanna hurt you or Jane. I'm... I'm a family man myself. In fact you even remind me of my brother. Real rugged, silent type like you, but he wasn't no blue collar. No, the man was educated and he made damn sure everyone knew it, too. He had this big University of the State of Texas ring, he used to flash on my face, reminding me that he went to college and I didn't finish elementary school. Anytime Mr. UT wanna shut me up, he'd just knock on the table with that ring, go knock, knock, knock. Well, I guess we know who the black sheep of the family was. What'd you say? I'm just saying your brother don't strike me as the type to hold people hostage in... - Hmm. - ...weird houses and make 'em dig up shit. My brother's dead, asshole. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. No, you're not. That's just something people say. How'd he die? Conversation's over. Well, I thought we was getting to be friends. You done getting everything you need? Yeah. Oh, baby, look at you, you got mud all over you. Could've been worse. Could've been blood. You shouldn't have run off like that, baby girl. Oh, Victor scared you, huh? You know, he wasn't always this violent. Took a lot of work to get him like that. Before I came around, he was real soft. He always lettin' his fancy college educated brother just walk all over him, run, run the show. Little bitch. I had to toughen my boy up. You know, you and me, baby, we ain't that much different. I lost my mama when I was little, too. Let's do make up. All right, make you less Little House on the Prairie. It's sad. Oh! Well, fuck me sideways. You want some? Well, fuck you then. It's your loss. All right, so give me your face. Stop! I'm working here! It's important. Haven't you learned your lesson? Hold still. I'll make you pretty. There we go. I'm sorry for being rough on you. It ain't your fault your daddy brought you on this job. At least he loves you enough to keep you around. I never knew my daddy. I only met him... twice in my life. Once when I was born to pay my mama off... and the second time to try me out. No emotional support. Always looking for love in all the wrong places. Used, abused... ...hardened, and angry. Just a sad, broken bitch. Maybe I'm making all this shit up. Vic can't seem to tell. He believes everything I say. But that's just between us girls, okay? Okay? There you go. All glown up. You're so fucking cute, it's gross. I promise you when the time comes, I'll make it quick and painless. Hey, what the hell you doing to her? Do you like it? You take that crap off of her face. - Hey, hey, hey. - No, she looks perfect. That's enough out of both of you, all right? We're losing time. Let's go. Huh? It's the utility location services. They come in, mark the lines and before the excavation crew gets in. - I'll go get rid of him. - Oh, no, no, no. So he can go back to his boss and tell him somebody on the property told him to leave? No. Can't do that. All right, I'll fuck in... All right, listen here, Brennan. You get out there and humor him, all right? Let him do his job and then show him the door. - All right? - Sure. I'll be in the camper with your daughter. Hey, baby, here, I'll be listening to everything you say right now. - Okay. - This shit's fucking hot. Here we go, down your ear. - All right. - All right? - All right, I got it. - All right. Don't try anything stupid. Listen, he tries to signal for help, - you shoot him up, all right? - Okay. Go on. I'll be in the camper with your daughter. Howdy. Can I help you? - Good morning. You the home owner? - No. No, I'm just, uh, just working on the property. - You here to mark the lines? - Yeah, yeah. I got to make sure they're all marked up before anybody does any digging. Right. Well, have at it, yeah. I mean, that's a good idea. That's right, we don't want anybody getting killed. Where's he going? I ain't got all fucking day, Brennan. Hurry it up. So, uh... so you gonna go throughout the whole property or... Wherever this thing leads me. Yup. That fat motherfucking piece of shit. I almost wanna fucking kill him. Camping out? Yeah. I... camp on site, it saves me the drive. It's easier than driving in all the way... You know, it's... Good answer, Brennan. You're the only one out here? No, I've got my... Workers are in town. They're picking up some supplies, they'll be back in a bit. Looks like the line's leading us over here. Yeah. This shit's fucking boring me. - You are a fucking boring... - Let me clean that up for you. Motherfuckers, ain't you? I could never have a real job. Yeah, so... Uh... I ain't got all fucking day, Brennan. Hurry up. You ever get some, uh... criminal activity out here? No, sure don't. Seems like just a place where anything can happen. Get him the fuck... ...out of here, we got a fucking dig! I'm just thinking, you know, you never know what... Nothing around here, pal. Oh, Daddy thinks he's getting slick. - Well, you don't need to get inside, right? - Hey. Where's he going, Brennan? You don't need to go in here, do you? It's where the receiver's leading me. We're not really working in... In the house? He finds that body, he joins it. Yeah, dammit. A mistake. Looks like we're all done here. So, what do I do if... In case there's an emergency? Everything all right, sir? Yeah. I was just wondering what to do in case of an emergency. You mean if you accidentally hit a line? Yeah. Call the cops right away. So call... 9-1-1. Yeah, that's it. 9-1-1, huh? Fucking 9-1-1. Like, call the police? Yeah, that's right. Brennan? Here's the... Here's all the pertinent information. You hear me, Brennan? You take care now. Yeah. Oh, fucking police, huh? Come on! Come on! What was all that dial 9-1-1 talk, Brennan, huh? Dangerous neighborhood, huh? - Hey, hey, hey! - Fucking bullshit me. I told you what I was gonna do if you fucking bullshit me. I told you what I'll fucking do to her, huh. - He's gone. Hey! - He... He left. I'll blow her fucking brains out right now! He's gone! He's gone. I got rid of him. What more do you want? We're on a tight schedule, get back to fucking work. Yeah, sure. Yeah, okay. Come on, Jane, let's go to work. Calling the fucking police. Just fucking try that shit again, man, I'll fuck you up. All right. Ain't you glad you ain't digging? They can see us. Cool your jets, what's the matter with you? I'm fine, I'm fucking fine. Bullshit. You're twitching like a crack whore. Well, I needed it, fuck face. I hate being in this stupid-ass shithole. You think I like being here? You know, being here brings back a couple of memories - I'd rather forget. - Oh, you'd rather forget? He tried to kill me. Yeah, he cut my fucking throat. Ain't exactly a massage and a blow job. Well, what if we do all this hard labor shit, and it doesn't end up working out? What you mean? You think you're so smart. You think you're such a fucking professional. What if we dig it up, and we put it somewhere else and some new son of a bitch finds it? Well, uh... Well, ain't you a Cassandra now? You're such a swinging dick. Why don't you just own up to what we did, huh? Tell your daddy the truth. Of course you won't, because deep down inside, you're just a little baby boy. Right? Which is why I'm stuck here cleaning up your mess, babysitting daddy and his deaf daughter when I should be drinking Mai-Tai's in Cancun. Okay, no more drugs for you, young lady. It's like you're waiting for them to turn on us. And that Brennan, he's a dick. And I'm telling you, baby, you play around with a dick long enough, you end up getting fucked by it. Watch your mouth, you fucking janitor-looking-ass bitch. - Fuck you. - Fuck you. You don't know shit. Settle down, before we gonna visit the dentist. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too, baby. It's just... This dig is taking so long. What you doing? Having fun. - Now? - Yeah, right now. - I think they're busy, right? - Oh, yeah. - You like that, baby? - Yeah, yeah. You're gonna listen to everything I say? I'm gonna listen to everything you say. Everything? - Say it. - Oh, you are the boss. You'll listen to me from now on? Oh, whatever you say. Why are you taking so long? - Fuck you. Fuck you. - Oh, yeah. The longer we dig, the longer we live. Squirrel! Fuck! Come on. Stay with me. Go, go! You, fuck yeah. Wait, did you hear that? Nope. Exactly. Oh, fuck! Hey, hello? Help! Help, help, help, help! This way, this way, this way... Damn! I'll go low. Come on. Okay, go, go. All right. Oh, fuck. Dammit. Come on, we gotta keep moving. Come on! We got to find a car. The first fucking car that comes around. Hey, help! Help! Help! Help! Help! What? No. Oh, no, no, no, no... Oh, shit. Hey, you need a ride? You know, I feel like we got off on the wrong foot, Brennan. Please, just... just let us go. We're not gonna say anything, not gonna tell anybody about this. And you know, I believe you. I really do, and I'm gonna let you go. You got my word, with that money like I said. But right now, well, we still need your particular set of skills to finish the dig, amigo. Yeah, come on, Brennan. Vic might be a lot of things, but he ain't no liar. Ain't no liar. Mm-mm. Come on, baby, load up. Come on. Shit! Oh, shit. Baby. All right. I'm gonna untie you now, but you gotta get back to work. That's it? That's all you're gonna do after the two of them ran away? I fucking beat the man, didn't I? No, it's her fault. She's the one that's been conspiring after we told her not to. Now what the fuck did you say? Hey, hey. Hey. Oh, hey. Put this in your mouth. Oh, baby, that's not necessary. - You know what they say. - Monsters. Spare the rod, spoil the child. No! - You're a fucking monster. - Oh, man. Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Fuckin' A. Wow. You're a fucking man. Playtime's over. Gonna have to get back to work. Fuck... Anybody home? Oh, shit. Guys? Wait. Is everything okay? Oh, that... that's that kid, he was a squatter. He was staying here in the house. I told the guy to leave. Guys? Guys. Who's the party crasher? Well, look, who we've got here. Jane's got herself a little Romeo coming out to play John Wayne. Guys. He's just a kid. Man, you look like a little snack. Okay, enough. What, baby, don't be jealous. I ain't jealous, I just don't see you need to be kissing up on fucking Dennis the Menace over here. Get down! Hey, hey, he's a drifter, okay? He's come and go, he means nothing. Please just let me go. - Oh, yes. - There's no reason to do this, guys. Just let the kid go, will you? Does anyone know that you're here? No, nobody knows I'm here. - Nobody knows, kiddie? - Well, somebody might. I mean, he might have talked to somebody. Nobody knows. Well, that's good. That makes things easier. Oh! Whoo, shit! I'm sorry, sweetheart. Looks like you're gonna have to swipe right on some other hero to save you. Might be a little too soon, but... - you can do better than him. - Yeah. Yeah, he's cute, he just didn't really have that thing, you know. Yeah, a pulse. In all seriousness, Brennan, this is on you, man. You two see that, right? - Huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, I see it. - This death's on you, man. If you hadn't wasted time running off, we would have gotten what we came here for and be long gone before little fucking Tiger Beat came knocking. You know what we call that? That's called a "cosmic epiphany." Baby, I got goosebumps. Well, looks like Pablo's got a little best friend. Let's take him out back. Fucking bullshit. Brennan, you were right. We would have been lost under this jungle of dirt and concrete down there. Ain't you lucky we spared your life. You know, Victor, I've been thinking about this whole thing. About why us. Why this place. - Have you now? - Yeah. I figure, whatever you got down here, must have been real important for you to go through all the trouble to bury it. Yeah, what you put in the ground, you expected it to stay in the ground, didn't you? That's enough figuring from you. Why don't you get back to work? Yeah, you know what? I want to know. Hey, hey, don't you worry, Curious George. You're gonna find out soon enough. Now get back to work. Jesus, what's that smell? Just keep digging, Brennan. Who are we digging up here, Victor? What is this, 20 questions? Just do your job, Daddy. Oh, shit. All right, look what I got here. Wrap these around the front and the back. Both of you guys, wrap the rope around the... Brennan, you get your daughter to tie that or I'm gonna take her hand out. Come on. All right, you guys, let's tie them. Oh, my God. Your brother. What can I say, Brennan. Family matters are, uh... complicated. Victor's family has got a way of handling things. - Ain't that right, baby? - Yeah, that's right. That's good you stand up to your older brother, Mr. Texas State. Even when he tries to kill you, steal your girl, and the money. Oh, wait a minute, baby. I thought you said that he tried to kill you? Yeah, he did, baby, both of us. You gonna believe her, Victor? I mean, there's a lot of money in them walls, and I'm willing to bet... there's a lot more in there. She don't seem like the sharing type. Hey, story time's over. Don't you worry about our demons, Brennan. Come on, old man, you got your own haunting you. I tell you what, I ain't got nothing like that. What about your dead wife? Yeah. - Oh. - You know... everybody's a killer if they get the chance. All right. Oh. Fuck, Billy. He looks small. Fuck, Billy smells like shit. Hey, that's my brother you're talking about. All right. We got four hour till daylight. Which means we got, like, eight hours until the excavation crew gets here. Which leaves us just enough time to dispose of Billy and Pablo and Tiger Beat. Yeah, but what about... Not them right now, 'cause we need to leave this place empty. I don't wanna carry all them bodies on my own. So, we'll just lock them up until we're ready to leave. No. That's bullshit. I'm doing it right now. You gonna make me carry five fucking bodies on my own? Why are you being so fucking lazy? I'm just saying it's a lot of fucking bodies, is all. I'm doing it right fucking now. All right, time to do more chores. Let's go. Single file. I said fucking go! Whoa. Yeah, okay, okay. Got a lot more work to do. Uh... All right. Get down. All right, Daddy, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can watch little miss angel face die first... or I can put you out of your pathetic misery. Hmm. Get your dirty hands off my kid. Why don't you shut the fuck up? - Hey, baby. - What? Can I borrow you for a second? Jesus fucking Christ. This dumb-ass. - Hey. - What? So, sweetheart, Brennan got me thinking... maybe he awakened a rather long held suspicion I've had, maybe Billy wasn't trying to "kill" you. Maybe the two of you alone in that room with all that money - gave you ideas? - Oh, so now you're gonna listen to complete strangers. Did he try to kill you, Lola? It don't matter anymore, baby. Shit. I killed my brother, so I'd say it's sort of kind of maybe fucking matters! Now, the shit ain't paranoia if the shit is true. Now, I'm gonna ask you something and I'mma only ask you once, okay? Did you fuck my brother? ...to forgive each other... and ourselves. Hell, I fucked your daddy, too. - God, I fucking knew it! - That money was mine. My body earned it. Your brother was a dickwad and your daddy don't love you, hell, he put a fucking hit on you. I saved you from your brother. You should be thanking me. Baby... I just say it like it is. Fuck my brother and then get me to kill him, you fucking bitch! That's why I fucking love you! You're the smartest fucking woman I know. - Bitch, you gonna marry me. - Yeah. I'll marry you. Lola. Lola. Let's get the hell out of here. Oh... Brennan! Brennan! Run. Run, run, run! Man, you got a good shot, huh? - Holy shit, Brennan. - Jane! Jane! Fucking does that hurt? - Jane! - Oh, I don't like doing this. You think I enjoy this shit? You wanna fucking die right now, fucking motherfucker? Please, stop. Stop. - You get off my kid! - You, motherfucker! - Oh, you're in pain, aren't you? - Don't touch her! You're in fucking pain. Just where do you think you're going, sweet cheeks? Show her a fucking good time. Show her a little fucking discipline. What the fuck you doing, bitch? You're about to fuck... Fucking brat. Teach her some fucking. manners. Baby? Baby? Oh, shit. - Come on. Come on. Go. - Oh, shit. Oh, no, baby. You fucks! Oh, baby. Oh! Okay, okay, get in. Oh, baby. No, you fucking bitch. Go, go. Go. Oh, God. Thank God. Okay. Damn it. Fuck! Fuck! I'm gonna take your heart out of your fucking body. Going to tear you! Shit! Fucking bitch, you're next. Fuck you! I'm gonna fuck you up right now, bitch! We're gonna start a family together, I'll be gentle. Dad! Princess. Oh, honey. Oh, baby, it's all right. It's done, it's over. It's over, sweetie. It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. I love you. Oh, honey. Honey... I love you too. You okay? You're all right, it's okay. No more driving for you tonight, little lady. Let's go home, squirrel.
