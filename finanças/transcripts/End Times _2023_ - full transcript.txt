This is TXO zero five zero transmitting in the blind on all open channels. Is there anybody receiving me? Echo, echo. Tango one-seven, respond. Tango one-seven, we're declaring a Red One situation. I say again, this is a Red One situation. -Hey. -Hey. Where are we? Just a room. How you feeling, kiddo? It hurts to talk. I can't get a whole breath. I'm hot... and cold, too. Cold inside. I got it, don't I? Yeah. Ronnie? Veronica? Veronica? Ronnie... Ronnie. It's me. It's Daddy. Do you remember? I tried to get here as soon as I could. I'm so... I knew you'd come here. Where we had all the good times. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to get here as quick as I could. Honey! Listen to me. Listen to my voice. Ronnie, please! Ronnie! Ronnie! Please! Ronnie, please. Please. Ah! Mmm. Mmm! Well, okay. Come on. Ah! Listen. Listen. Listen to me, you'll all right? And there's no negotiating, okay? All right, if you're real good, like, you don't put up too much of a fuss or anything, you're gonna be all right, more or less. -Okay? -Okay. And if not, I'm gonna break both your fucking legs, and then I'm gonna gut and I'm gonna stab you, and you're gonna wait around here for whoever show up presently. No! We understand each other? All right, good. Now, you take your pants off. Aah! Oh, Lordy, would you look at that. Quiet! I do not need to hear your voice right now. Ah! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. What do you think you're doing? You still got my two boys here to go. Alexis, too, if she wants to play. Me next, Ciro, okay? Yeah. Age before beauty, right? Heads up, people. How many you got? -Half a dozen or more. -They got us fived. We have no exit to the rear. I need just a minute. Getting your dick wet isn't worth getting killed for. Agreed. Okay, everybody fall back? No, no, just hold them off for a second. -Hey! -Ah! I say, you do, you gimp fuck! Get out of here! Please, please. Sorry, honey. You just ain't worth it. Ah! I'm sorry. Did you two want to be alone? We know what we're doing, don't we? You did some fighting in life, right? They keep some of the traits they had before. Makes them all just a little different. And dangerous. Guess you weren't that good. My guess is, somebody's had a pretty rough couple of weeks, huh? Please, don't. Don't? Don't hurt me. Okay, I won't. It doesn't pay to stay in one place too long. You headed somewhere? It was, uh, I was trying to get inside, so... So I could hide until... Until? Until this... whatever this is is over. Oh. Well, you might have a long wait. Look... You can come with me if you want, for a while. Why? You know, on second thought, forget it. Look, I have food. Not a lot, but enough to keep two people going for a bit. You look like you could use a good meal. Maybe I'm safer on my own. You're not. From the looks of it, you look like you got about another week, where you get so hungry, you can't even walk. When that happens, they'll sniff you out. They'll come for you. There's nothing you can do to fight them off. And they'll tear you the pieces. And they'll eat those pieces. Chances are, you'll be alive long enough to see them start in on you. Up to you, young lady. There's a bunch of old World War II bunkers down in this area. You might be safe for a night. So where are we going? There might be some fortified areas downtown. I'm headed that way. But in the meantime, if we hoof it, we can make one by nightfall, hopefully. I ran into some other people earlier. And then you. Everyone else I've seen is... Dead? -Yeah. -Yeah. Same here. How many? How many what? Dead? No, how many people? How many are left? I'm not sure. Most got evacuated out of the quarantine zone when the call went out. The call? You didn't hear the call? It was on television, radio, internet. They drove around with loudspeakers. No, I... I was out with friends and... I don't know. I woke up one morning two weeks ago and everything was like this. Typical. -I'm sorry? -Nothing. All right, all right, all right. First thing we got to do is get you some real damn shoes. You're never going to be able to run in those. And sooner or later, you're going to want to run. You need some protection for your eyes and mouth. I don't know if you can catch this thing like you can catch the cold. Pays to be safe. You all right? Did you say something about food? Wonderful. I used to love tenderonis when I was little. Well, enjoy, sweetheart. This is last of the gourmet stuff. After this? It's a steady diet of kidney beans and creamed corn until I find more food somewhere. So, what happened? What happened when? I mean, this. What happened to the world? Wow. You really weren't watching the news, were you? I don't really watch the news. It's too depressing. Right. All that useless information. They first started reporting cases in rural areas about two months ago. Places like Brownsville, Pennsylvania, Kankakee, Illinois, DeQuincy, Louisiana. High incidences of violent crimes. Unexplained attacks. Curiosity bits on the local news. Nothing for Washington to notice. Eventually, though, it... started showing up in small cities. Albuquerque, Toledo, Savannah, Pittsburgh. They couldn't ignore it. Something heavy was going down. Then we started hearing about Kenya, and Bangladesh, and Ecuador, and Hokkaido, and even Iceland. It was everywhere. It was big time. It was in D.C., New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles. Everywhere. Sounds like you know all about it. I used to work for the government. People around me were being kept apprised of the situation. So what was wrong with them? Well, for starters, they're dead. But... Really dead. They're brain dead, I guess you'd say. The higher functions atrophied. What you got left is the reptile brain. Instinct, you know. Hunt. Kill. Eat. Probably what our earliest ancestors were like. How did they get that way? There's a lot of theories lying around on the Internet. When there was an Internet. Nobody could figure it out. Not while it counted. But you said people evacuated out of the... -Quarantine zone. -Yeah. They set them up around the most populated areas that could hit. You're in the middle of the Los Angeles one now. 150 miles in diameter, from Santa Clarita all the way down to Orange County. But if we could get out, then... Wow, that's brilliant. I hadn't thought of actually trying to get out of the death zone. The perimeters are guarded. They got orders to shoot on sight. They figure if you're still in here, you're on your own. I'll take watch for a bit. What the fuck are you doing? Every flesh-eater in five miles probably heard you wailing. God, I woke up and where the hell were you? Shh! Sorry, next time I'll squat down right next to you. No, I'm... Look, I'm sorry, okay? I just... I thought that you were... Explain to me why I would invite you along and then leave you? Look, I panicked, okay? Do we have to dwell on it? We should be moving. What? Nothing. Just realized I don't even know what your name is. You can call me Freddie. Everybody does. Everybody did. Come on. Everybody's... gone. Yeah, I guess they figured no buildings left and nobody left. -Shit. -Go back. Well, go around, go around. Well, if it's just one of them... It's never just one. Just... they cluster in packs, these guys. Just go back. All right. Ah! Ah! Thanks for the help. I'm sorry, I... I couldn't. Forget it. Come on, let's go. Come on, come on. Can I ask you a question? Could I stop you? What about us? No idea what you're talking about. We're not... You know, like them. How come? Did you go on a trip lately, Caribbean or somewhere further south? Yeah, two months ago. My friends and I, we went for spring break. We went to Bali, stayed in a resort. Nice little get away. Did you go to the doctor first to get immunized? Yeah, he gave some pills and some shots, too. One of the drugs he probably gave you was doxycycline. It's used to immunize against malaria and dysentery. They usually give it to Americans traveling to equatorial climates. They also give it to military personnel. The serum, it works itself out eventually. You wouldn't have gotten it recently, you would have gone over, too. So what happens when this stuff works itself out of us? I'm so tired. Hey, watch out. I could go for a swim. Yeah. All that water. Slow down. For all that has come to pass has been foretold, and it's not just to the book of Revelations to which I refer. I read from Isaiah chapter 26. Thy dead men shall live, and together shall they arise. Awake and sing ye that dwell in the dust, for the earth shall cast out its dead. Go my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee. Hide thyself for a little moment, until his wrath has passed by. For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity. I'd save the batteries. Why aren't they doing anything? Who? You know, the military or whoever. The focus will be to contain the outbreak, protect the uninfected population. Keep safe the percentage that can be saved. And the rest? Pretty much screwed. Great. Don't they know there's people here? Shh, no sound, no sound. Part of the landscape. I don't know, man. I still think we got ripped off. Those two cases of hollow points are a fair trade for that sack of crap we had. Last time I checked, we can't eat bullets, dude. We can't eat what we can't kill. Yeah, let's hope you don't get killed before we find some food. Yeah, let's... hope you don't get killed. I don't like this. I don't like it either. We need water, though. Just... stay behind me. Stop, right there. Hey, easy. We're not looking for trouble. I saw your signs down at the beach road, said you had food to trade. Long as you got something to trade. Well, I got some knives, some paracord, water sterilization packs. Yeah, but we got all that, bud. Ciro! What? What's going on? Oh, well, look at this fella. Just looking to do a little trading. I just need some foodstuffs. Your sign said you could help out with that? Well, I could. That doesn't mean I'd be so inclined. What you got there? She's with me. Is she? It's no good, chief. Hush! Can't you see we got company? You've been around, old man, haven't you? You know, my, uh, my daddy was in the 'Nam. Saw some hard shit. Did some, too. You got eyes like his. -Yeah? -Yeah. It's too bad I fucking hated my daddy. You want to talk, or you want to trade? We got places we gotta be. Sure, I want to trade. But the question is, uh, what are you willing to part with? You know, we changed our minds. I think we'll be gone. Oh, no, you won't. Hey, sugar, you want to step out from behind the gentleman so we can take a good look at you? Come on. Oh, I remember you. What he did to you... Now's your chance to make it right. Look. Cock the hammer back like this. Stop! What? What happened to... Oh, Jesus, really? No! You can't. She's a woman for Christ's sakes. Yeah, she's a woman who would have watched them shoot us without a second thought. Please. Please, stop. Please, no. What he did to you... I couldn't have stopped it. I'm sorry. Go look at what's in back. Then talk to me about mercy. Here, put these on. That girl, um... She... She's gone. Better get going soon. Bodies will be attracting them. Oh. Hey, here. Has your name written all over it. Ah... Are you all right? Agh... I was supposed to get this tooth fixed last week. I figure my dentist's probably not practicing no more. I know what you're thinking about. You did no wrong killing those two back there. There's probably still good people on this earth. With bad ones like them, they just need a good killing. Yeah. Hard the first time, though. Was it hard for you? Your first time? I don't hardly remember now. It was a long time ago. I was younger than you. There've been plenty more since. Bad people? I'm sure some of them were pretty bad, yeah. What about your people? You got parents, I figure. I don't know. Last I talked to them, they were in Geneva or Bonn... Maybe it was Istanbul. I can't remember. You don't care much about what might be happening to them? No. No, I guess I don't. Think that makes me some kind of monster? -Can I ask? -Yes, for Christ's sakes. Just ask, okay? Why don't we just get a car and make some time? Look up. Tell me what you see. A few clouds, a little bit of sun. What's also up there that you don't see are drones, satellites. They're watching this area. Who? Government? I thought you said that Washington was... Government has fail safes, redundancies. Flock of high powered individuals that get called up in the case of emergency to run things, see. You know, people you and I didn't vote for. That sounds a little bit like an... Conspiracy? That's what you're gonna say? Yeah. I've been on the government payroll for the last six years, but you won't find any record of it. I've guarded some of these guys. I've taken care of problems that jeopardized the continuation of this kind of power. Taken care of. You get that? I guess so. Before that I was in special ops overseas. Places you'd never hear of on the news, if you watched the news. Cleaning up messes these bastards needed cleaning up. And this relates to the car discussion, how? If they're watching, and they are... They're looking for home grown insurgencies. Weapon stockpiling like our friends were doing back there. Things that if and when this whole business ends, they're going to have to deal with. Best we stay off their radar. Inconspicuous. Because I think getting a car would be a great idea. Fine. You go and find yourself a car. You hotwire it and you drive right up to the QZ line. I'm sure if you ask nicely, they won't shoot you on first sight. Meanwhile, I'll just be here walking. You don't have to be a dick. Sometimes being a dick is exactly what's called for. You need to learn that. When are you going to show me how to use this thing? Right now. Come on. Wha... You mean? I mean, come at me. Come on, take a swing. I'm sorry. Do you need help lifting it? Ah! First lesson, don't attack when angry. Ah! Pick up your weapon. Pick up your weapon. Pick it up. All right. Come on again. Ah! These people are strong. I don't think they feel much pain, but they're still people. No matter how strong you are, your arm doesn't bend this way. You've got to get them under control. Then you can dispatch them from safety. End of first lesson. They know we're here. You could have taken them. Best way to win a fight is not to fight at all. Come on. Let's backtrack. Can't have a fire? Not tonight. Not here. We're too exposed. No animals. What? I can't hear any animals. No crickets, no owls. Shouldn't we be able to hear something? Yeah, we should. What the hell was that? Weren't no animal. Was it one of them? I don't think so. There's two of them. They've been following us for a spell now. Human? Well, if they're not dead, then what are they? I think they're hungry. What the hell are you doing? Final lesson. You've got to be shitting me. Hey, you're gonna have to fight off these crazy bastards sooner or later. You might as well get some practice in. Remember what I told you. Stay calm and remove your emotions from the situation. Remember, they won't all be on chains. Do you mind? Excellent. Excellent. Excellent. You did everything right. You're a goddamn son of a bitch! He totally could have gotten to me. I could have died. Hey! Time for you to wake up and look around yourself, Claire. You know, you could die out here any moment of any day. We're in the middle of the most hostile environment any human has ever experienced. The chances are, any person that you meet in this environment is going to be trying to kill you one way or the other. And I'm going to make damn sure you can take care of yourself. In case... In case what? In case I can't. Seriously? Yeah. That little sucker punch of yours was the last straw. Don't get this tooth out soon, I'm gonna get mean. You don't want to see me get mean. I'd do it myself, but I ain't got no mirror. It's one halfway back there. See it? Oh, yeah. I can see it. You don't have to tell me. Okay. We're going to go on three. All right? All right. All right? One... Ah! Ew... Oh! Jesus fucking Christ! That's my girl. Give me. Shit. Jesus. Let's go. Keep your eyes open. Where'd they all go? Oh. Well, obviously the good news is we didn't have any trouble crossing the perimeter. And the bad? Bad is there is no safe place anymore. It's everywhere. Maybe they just retreated back. They got overrun because they were too spread out. There weren't enough men to keep a perimeter that large secure. They would never be able to hold an even larger one. He which hath no stomach to this fight, let him depart. His passport shall be made. That was really close. Put the fire out now. It's no good. They can smell it. Leave everything but your weapon. Go, now! You done much climbing? I climbed the plastic rock wall at FlyZone once. Yeah, I'm not counting that. That's a steep ascent... not a lot of handholds... lotta loose talus. And we have no climbing gear. And we haven't eaten for a day. So we go through. Yeah. Jesus. H... Fuck. Piece of shit. Here. Looks like turning back ain't no option now. What's keeping them from following us? No idea. It's bad enough to scare those fellas. Yeah. Oh... I guess we'll see if all your FlyZone training pays off after all. You sense that? Yeah. Good. You're getting better. Do we go back? Nah. It's got us now. What the? Oh my God, it's a girl. Thank you, I noticed. What the hell is she doing up here? Hey there. You scared her. I didn't mean to. Yeah, you're scary. Whatever. Hey. Hey, little girl. Hey, wait up. It's okay. Hey. Jeez, she's fast. She's got to be going somewhere. What the fuck? Hey, it's okay. We're not going to hurt you. No. No! Wait! It's okay. I'll see you soon. For your sake, I better see her soon. Whoo! I think you missed a spot. You let me know if you find anything unusual down there, won't you? You okay? What? I have never seen your face clean before. Yeah, well, don't get too used to it. Let's go. Come with me. What is this place? I don't know. I think we're going to find out pretty soon. This way. Yeah. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Welcome, welcome. I'm so glad you both could make it here. Welcome. Where exactly is here? We call it The Garden. It's safe here. The tunnel is guarded. We're very careful who we allow through. We're even more selective about who we let be part of our family. All right, ladies. Let's not overwhelm our new guests. Let's actually get them set up with a couple tents, okay? Thank you. I'm sorry, will you be sharing a tent together? Yes. Um, no, actually, um, separate is fine. Wonderful. Well, my name is Hayden, and if you need anything or anything troubles you at all, I want you both to feel free to come to me about it. Again, welcome. Hey, that's funny, because we didn't feel too welcome when we got here. And for that, I sincerely apologize. But we must be constantly vigilant in our efforts to keep the sickness out of our sanctuary. That makes sense. Thank you for understanding, Claire. Again, I'm very happy that you both are here. Her tent is ready. The gentleman's gonna take a little more time. As it does. Excellent. Well, Claire, why don't you join Deirdre and rest up a bit? Dinner's gonna be served shortly. Okay, thank you. So you're the head honcho here, huh? I'm sorry? Leader? In-charge person? We stay clear of titles here at The Garden. Titles tend to empower a few while disenfranchising the group. But people answer to what you say. I have a greater responsibility than most, yes, but we're not like the military, Freddie. Everyone's here because they want to be. No one is here against their own will. They can leave anytime they choose. That's good to hear. I sincerely hope you and Claire decide to stay. But if you choose to go, that is your choice. But first, my tired friend, let's get some good food in you and a proper night's rest. Come. I know it may seem strange, but we do like to show our affection in little ways. It does help to protect us from the despair that surrounds all of us. No, it's nice. Here's your tent. Thanks. It's nice. Hayden insisted on nothing but the best for our guests. You and Hayden are together? Monogamy is the old society's way of limiting a woman's sexual power. We take a much more open approach to sexuality here. Thank you. You guys are all very sweet. You're very pretty. I hope you decide to stay. We can become very good friends. Come in, Freddie. Okay, so what's the plan? The plan for what? For getting out of here. Figure we eat dinner, wait for night, and bug out when most of them are sleeping. I don't understand. What part? All of it. Why are we leaving? Seriously? You don't see it? See what? Claire, these people, they're bad news. They look good. They smell good. They talk nice. But? Nothing's this perfect. No group lives like this without a control, some kind of fear factor. Believe me, there's something dark behind all this. Trust me. You're being paranoid. And cynical. You haven't even given these people a chance to prove that they're all right. I don't need to. I have instincts, and I trust my instincts, and all my instincts are screaming at me to get as far away from these folks as I can. Freddie, do you think that maybe... I mean, we've been on the road for a long time. Do you think that maybe... What? Maybe it's taken its toll. What we've seen, maybe it's hurt us, impaired our judgment. You mean my judgment? I'm not trying to be mean. The thing is, is that I like it here. I like these people. I like smelling nice, and I like the fact that I can sleep in this tent tonight for the first time in a long time I don't have anything to worry about. It's easy for you to say, your tent's bigger than mine. Stay here with me, just for tonight, okay? We can eat and sleep, and then in the morning, if you still want to leave, then we can talk about it. Okay? Okay. Hello. Welcome to The Garden. Skip it, sweetheart. It's all vegetable? Meat can harbor the flesh eating sickness, so we think it's safer to stick with plants. My brothers, my sisters, my friends... we're gathered here today to welcome two weary travelers that have made the long, hard walk to be here. Let's drink to them. It's hard times we find ourselves in without doubt. Without doubt. But we do not fear. Why? Because the bonds that unite us as a family are made strong by these troubles. Strong. So I'm going to make a bold statement with all of you today here as my witness. We will not be torn apart by the conflagration that has befallen us. We will not revert to eating one another's flesh like so many of my brothers and sisters have. And we will not kill each other out of spite, but we will protect our little promontory of safety and everyone within it. Until the sun once again shines on a peaceful planet. Shines. At one point, you know, after I'd killed like five of them... -Wow, five? -Yeah, it was insane. Yeah, I was so mad at him for disappearing. Ah! Ow, let me go! God! Hey, that was pretty good. So, you ready to go now? After that? After what? And no. No, I'm not, Freddie. I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying right here. -It's him, isn't it? -Who? What's his name? Goldilocks? Viking Jesus guy with his brotherly, sisterly love bullshit? Hayden. God, don't be ridiculous. Couldn't figure it out at first. You're too smart to fall for this place. You're oversimplifying. And you're being a brat. I am not being a brat, okay? I'm making a choice. And I've decided that I'm going to stay here. You know what your problem is, Freddie? You like it. You like the running and the killing and the living life on the edge. That's what makes you happy. You don't want to live someplace peaceful. Come on, Ronnie. Ronnie? Who's Ronnie? Oh, what? Is that somebody else that you killed? Claire, I'm... I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to... Yes, yes, you did. Yes, you did. Because this, this is who you are. You're just a thug who thinks he can solve every problem with violence. You haven't complained very much when I save your ass. Fine. Fine. Go on then. Go on walking forever and ever. And starving and sleeping two hours a night and fighting for your life all the time. I don't care what you do. And I don't care about you. So you feel like you're fitting in? Yeah. Yeah, I do. I'm still having nightmares, though. I... I don't know. I guess I feel like I'm still on the road sometimes, you know? It'll pass. I got through it. You haven't always been here? No. Just give it time. Well, hopefully I can get one of these soon. You will. Hayden says that you're assimilating marvelously. Did he really? Just be patient with us. Be patient with yourself. Be careful. You wouldn't believe how happy I am to see you. Ah! Ah! Wow, what's all this? This is our communication center. We're isolated up here, so back in the day it was worthwhile to have some form of communication with the people down in the valley in case of an emergency or something. These days, it just pays to listen. We were actually picking up the military's bandwidth for a while. Lots of confusion. Lots of screaming. And recently? Nothing. Well, every now and then we'll get some poor fella in a fallout shelter with a ham radio set up calling out, but for the most part, it's just silent. Me and these people, we created The Garden so that we would have a place of peace away from the rest of the world with all its corruption, violence, and tyranny. That world, your world... It's gone now. It's not coming back. This place was a refuge before, and it's even more so now. We could live up here the rest of our lives, safely, together, as one family the way it was meant to be back in the old days. Claire, I want you to feel like you're part of my family, so that we can all be one, and share our love freely with each other. I think I'd like that. Good. Claire, what? What? I'm sorry, I've just had a really tough time. I know we've all had a tough time, but you know what the secret is? You have to learn to trust people again. Ah! No. No, no. No, I can't. No, I want to. I do. I think that you're... I just need some time, okay? Of course. I am sorry. The last thing I want to do is cause you any pain, Claire. Thank you. Thank you for understanding me. We're not going anywhere. -Hey. -Hey. You look upset. Come, have some tea. Is everything okay? Yeah, I was just... I was in the trailer with Hayden. Oh, no. Oh, God, Deirdre... I'm sorry. I thought that, you know, all this talk about being free and... No, it's fine. I'm fine. No, you're upset, I can tell. Look, nothing happened, I swear. Right? It's just, I've had a really tough time and realized that I'm not, you know... I can't. With anyone. Like I said, it's fine. You just drink your tea. Thank you. Thank you for understanding me. You're so very welcome. See you later. Okay. Hayden? Hayden, I'm sorry, can we just talk tomorrow? They're coming for you. Who? Shh, you have to leave. Now. Shh. Freddie? Is that you? This is why I tell Hayden we should shoot anyone who comes through that tunnel. Look what you brought into our perfect world. Disharmony and disease. Deirdre, please. I'm not interested in Hayden. He's all yours. I need your help. You think that this is personal? I'm just doing what I can to protect my people from the plague that your species has brought upon us. You won't be the first. And you probably won't be the last. Little Aggie? So sad, someone so young, full of that spark of life. What did you psychos do to her? She's with her daddy now. At peace. We had to, uh... burn the sickness out of her. No. No! No! It's a shame. I really liked you. We could have been close. I want to talk to Hayden. Hayden has a lot of responsibilities. He doesn't have time to bother with you. Hayden, I, um... It's fine. Carson told me. Be careful. Claire, not going to hurt anyone, are you, Claire? Hayden, I'm not sick. I swear, I'm not sick. This won't hurt. I'm sorry, Claire. It looks like it's the fire for you. What I need you to see, Claire, is that fear and the disease are very simple. They both can destroy everything you've worked very hard to build. Now, the only way to stop this from happening is for your actions to be swift, decisive, and without any margin for doubt. Fuckin' hippies. You guys are so fucked. They took my little girl. They burned her alive. You folks want to let that girl down right this second? Thanks. Yeah, no problem. I got it, don't I? Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm... It's not your fault. I don't know. How long before... 24 hours. Maybe less. My dad... He never read me bedtime stories. Too busy, I guess. I only know the tragedies. "No matter where of comfort, let no man speak. "Let's talk of graves and worms and epitaphs, "make dust our paper with rainy eyes "write sorrow on the bosom of the earth. "Yet, not so. But what can we bequeath "save our disposed bodies to the ground? "Our land, our lives and all our Bolingbroke's "and nothing can we call our own "except that small model of the barren earth "which serves as cover and paste to our bones. "For God's sakes let us sit upon the ground "and tell sad stories of death the kings. How some have been disposed, some were slain in war." Just... no sound. Looks like we got a little problem. And more than one for the looks of it, huh? Untie me. What? I can help you get away if you cut me free. You know I can't do that. I'd like to, but I can't. Please. Why can't you? Because of that. Because of that. Can you feel them? They're calling to me. Not with words. The flesh is calling. The flesh. Flesh. And dirt. And rot. And worm. Sweet decay. Cold deep down and sleep forever. What's it like? Like... A door. The wrong side of the door. I can see what's inside. Where I can't go anymore. I need you. You need me? I need you to save me. I... I can't. Claire, I can't. I can't save you. Yes, you can. Don't. Do you love me? I... I... Do you love me? Yes. Then love me enough to save me from what I'm becoming. I can smell you. Not surprising. Not just your sweat. I can smell the blood pumping through you. And I can smell your fear. I'm not afraid. Yes, you are. You're afraid you may not be able to do what you have to do. I can do it. Claire, trust me. I can do it. But not just yet. Not... for a while. While? Not while you're still you. Deal? Deal. Don't go far. You need to hurry. I can feel it behind my eyes. It burns. It's angry. It wants to devour the whole world. Starting... with you. No. Feels good. What's funny? It took end of the world... to bring out the good man in you. I need you... to put him away for me. For just one more moment. Not good enough. Oh, God.
