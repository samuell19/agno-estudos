Carry on, Mum. Act like I wasn't here. Come on! Come on! Come on. Let's dance. Come and dance. Take the receipt to customer service. I'll go elsewhere. This is outrageous! OK? - He looked serious. - I've had enough. Sorry I'm late. - I spoke to him. - Thanks. Have you see the time? That's twice this month. Next time, don't come at all. Family problems or not. - What did you tell him? - That your mother's in the hospital. Léa! Léa, wait! Hey! Are you coming over? I've got the film you missed. We could watch it this evening. I can't. What time tomorrow? I'll go to Granny's alone. My aunt Catherine will be there. Wait! Then I'll see you on Sunday? - We could go out. - I'll call you. Hi, Dad. Quieten down. She's sleeping. You were supposed to get her today. Something came up. We can't count on you. Here. That's the one you asked for. You've seen it, haven't you? My Trieste vacation. It was good. We were happy. Stop! There was space on it. - I added some pictures of you. - Thanks. - Bring back the others. - I haven't finished. What do you want with that old stuff? Though... at least someone's watching them. I can't anymore. Will you wake her soon? She needs rest. I need to know, for the house. Not now. I'm going tomorrow and I need to know if Mum wants anything. Tomorrow. We talked about this. You knew. I want to come. That's impossible. But I'm better. The doctor said. Leave her! You don't realize, she's not well. She's back at home now. She can decide, can't she? Please. Well. Suzanne's going back to bed. It'd be better if you went now. I'll come for you in the morning. Won't you kiss me? Do you want to make things worse? She's been out two days. She's not better yet. You didn't visit her in the clinic. You didn't get her this morning. She has a right to come. It's her damn house! Did you have to put her there? I had no choice. What? You can't just go like that. Stop! Go home! I can see something's wrong. - Go. - Tell me what's up! I don't want your help. I don't want it. Understand? Just go. Calm down. Just calm down! Fuck off! Just fuck off! - You're crazy. - Get lost. Get it? Get in! You're in the way. Let's go. Who are the flowers for? Granny. I'm getting Cathie at the hospice. Avanti! Avanti! Stop! Wind the window up. Are you sure you want to come? It'll be good. It'd be better if you stayed here. I won't be long. - Hi! - Oh! Léa! Cara mia. I wasn't expecting you. Oh! You shouldn't have. - Shall we go? - No, stay a bit. Just two minutes. Mum's waiting in the car. Unwrap the flowers. Let's get a vase. At the end of the corridor. Why did you bring her? She's in the car. You know what I mean. She's fine. - Are you crazy? - She wanted to help. - Don't you know? - It's her choice. Hello, Mum. What are you doing here? How is it here? OK? Fine. Like a hotel. You packed me off somewhere nice. Sorry. Luckily, your sister was here. You don't seem better. I missed you. Stop this foolishness. Get a grip on yourself. Basta! That's enough. What are the others doing? I'll wait for them outside. - Bye, dear. - Bye. It's nice to see you. For me too. Sorry, Mum. It took a while. Open the shutters. I'm coming. Right! Let's start. Where does this go? In the box. The rest goes in the bin. Here. Put it there. - There, I said. - It's heavy! Too heavy. She doesn't have to stay there, I can do it. I'm OK now. I am. I'm better. Come on. Come and sit down. - Oh damn! - "Oh damn!" OK! Oh, oh! "OK!" OK! OK! OK! - Stop! Stop! - OK! Stop... I missed you. Come on! OK! OK! I'll go and get the dessert. No! She kept it. What about that, Suzie? Eh! Does it still suit me? Is that for a nun? - It's a veil. - What? - A veil. - A funeral veil. Come on! This isn't a funeral. Wait. Stay as you were. No, not like this. Leave her. Take it off! Take if off! Take it off! Stop filming! It's not funny. That's enough now! Take it easy. Where are you going? I'm not tired. Are you happy? You're getting her worked up with your nonsense? Just control yourself! Your mother and grandmother are enough. I can't do everything. I asked for nothing. Just cut her some slack. - What? - You know. You and Dad are too much. You want to control everything she does. Stop treating her like she's mad. Why do you do it? If you just left her in peace. What's your problem? You don't want to understand. She's sick! Isn't it enough to have had her locked up? What do you think? That she can be alone at home? She wasn't like this before. Before me? Don't be so silly. Grow up. Mum? Mum! Cathie! She's gone! I'll go. See what you've done? I'm glad you came. That's better. Yes. It's good to smoke. To disappear. Don't tell your father. About what? Why do you stay with him? I'll help you. I've got my bridal veil. Let's go! Here! Wait. You don't want to go in like that. Come on. Have you seen the time? I've been waiting all evening. Where were you? I made a detour. You could have called. Sorry. - I was worried. - I'm sorry. Stop, Mum. I said it was my fault. You did nothing wrong. "I did nothing wrong." I want you to get some rest. What should I be like? What do you want me to be like? There. There. That's the way I love you. Go and sleep now. I'll leave you. Good idea. Lunch is at noon sharp. Then we're going to the clinic. Bye, Mum. See you tomorrow. Take that off! Take it off! Stop filming! Take it off! - Stop filming! - It's not funny. Stop! That's enough... Did you watch the tape? Yes. What cassette? From Trieste. We could go away. Get your things ready. We should go. So early? I have to go to the office. I'll take you. Then we can finish. - You'll take her? - Yes. OK. Then I'm going. Bye. Thanks. For what? For taking me with you, yesterday. I'll come and get you next Friday. I'll be there this time. I promise. We're here. Aren't you hot in your coat? - We're going. - Really? Where to? Paris? - San Remo? - Away from here, first. Madrid? Mexico? No! That's too far. Copenhagen? It's too cold. Trieste? How about Granny's house? That's nice and quiet. Yes. I'm thirsty. Are you coming? - Do you want something? - A Coke, please. - Hello. - Hello. - Petrol? - No, no. 16.50. I'll take that, too. - 19. - Here. Thanks. Your change! Where were you? I needed to freshen up. I got sandwiches. Here's your Coke. No! - To us! - To us! No! It'll go everywhere. No. Careful! Everywhere! I'll get you! Come on then! Wait! Wait! Ah! I feel so good. You're beautiful. - Are you hungry? - Yes. Come on! What do you think of me? Funny? Weird? Strange? Kind? I love you. I listen to your stories. When you're happy, I'm happy. When you're sad... We have fun together. How does it make you feel? What? The medicine. What effect does it have? None. Then why do you take it? What do you think of me? A bit lonely, maybe. Is your boyfriend Max nice? Leave it. I don't need anyone. Everybody needs somebody. We're together, aren't we? Yes. Give it to me. - You were right. - What? It's good to disappear. Shall we go? I don't want to get there too late. Come on! Come on! Let's race. Come on. Quick! - Wait! - Why? Scared of losing? Come on! Beautiful. You should film that. Yes, it is beautiful. Hold me. We're so high up. Stop, that's not funny! Stop! Hey! - Do you want a fight? - Come on. Want a fight? - Two seconds. - What? Come on. Come on! On three. You're crazy. OK. Go on! On three. Ready! Three! Ow! Wait, you'll see! Shall we go and get Cathie? No. That's a bad idea. It's nice with just the two of us. Yes. - Here, I'll help you. - No. No! No! Stop! Stop it! Stop! What do you think? I can get crazy too. Give it here. You'll see. What were you like aged 20? What did you like doing? I can't remember. Cathie and I used to get bored. There wasn't much to do here. We made short dresses with Mum's machine. It really annoyed her. But we went out anyway. We liked going out dancing. Then I met your father. There's a place I wanted to show you. No, we're carrying on now. It's not far. Turn there. There. There! That's the place where I used to go with Cathie. We're way out. Do you know the way? Yes, yes. Wait for me! We often came to this bar when we were young. Your sister and I had some times here. Nice, isn't it? We should go on. It's late. I've slept enough, don't you think? Get me a beer. No, you shouldn't. What can I get you? Two beers, please. Do you have a coin? Thanks. I haven't seen you. First time? Yes. She's going for it. Your friend dances well. What are you drinking? Nothing, thanks. Come on! - No. I can't. - Come on. Let's dance. No, let's sit down. Let's have some fun. I'll watch you. Stop! I don't want to. Please. - Wanna dance? - No. It's OK. Come on. - Come on now! - I don't want to. Let me go. Is that your mother? She's good. What's your name? How did you get here? She used to come when she was young. Hey! What's this? I can't leave you for two seconds! Hey! Give me that. Same again. My daughter needs to relax. Stop, Mum! What do you think you're doing? I'm having fun. Stop! You know you shouldn't. "Stop! You know you shouldn't." You've got a lot in common with your father, you know? Here we go. To us! Let's go. - Let's go, I said. - Leave me alone! - She said she's having fun. - Who asked you? Stop messing about. It's my speciality, isn't it? Let's go. Let's go, I said! I don't want to. That's enough! You're worked up. You need rest. Go away! Leave me alone! I'm not tired. Come on! Come here! I'm not tired. Do you hear? Mum! It's locked. Open up. OK. Open up. Now! Open this door! Shit! What is this? I'm soaked. Get lost. That's enough! - Get lost! - You're ridiculous. I know. I'm ridiculous. Open up, Mum. Open up, please. I'm cold. Open up. Shit! Stop with this. Stay locked in there, then. Fuck! You're driving me crazy! Shit! Why are you like this? Hey? Why are you like this? I'm on your side. I'm not like Dad. Can't you see what they're like? I feel sorry for you. For fuck's sake, stop! I can't take it! You're ruining my life. You want me to think your mad? Stay in your box, you freak! Get in the car right now. We're going. Put that camera down. Go on! Film your mother. It'd make a great video. Stop this shit! And smile. You look ugly like that. You're ridiculous. You already told me that. You're scared of having a crazy mother. Scared of being like me. Eh? Look at me. Will you never leave me in peace? We can't even just be together. It has to be about you. Even when you're not there. You're the only one. Do you get that? Do you? Come on! Come! Let's dance. No. I don't want to. Come on. Come on! - I don't want to. - Come on! Stop! Stop! There. I'm not crazy. I get tired sometimes. But I'm not crazy. I know. Go to sleep now. Mum! I won't be late. Go back to bed. Take your medication. OK! I love you. Bye. Yes, go now! Go on! Off you go. What are you doing here? Did your father send you? Did you speak to him? Is that it? But I'm fine. Everyone wants me to be tired, but I'm not. You've got the grumpy face. Come on. Relax. Darling. Why's everyone so worried? I'm fine. Yes. I'm fine. Say it. Say that I'm all right. Say it! Say it! Mum will be back any minute. It needs to be spic and span. Couldn't you help me, instead of just doing nothing? Your father left early this morning. He's busy at work. I miss him. He... He's coming back early today. He'll be pleased to see all this. I still miss you. Why do I miss you so much? But I'm pleased you're here. - You know? - Yes, I know. I'm pleased too. The table looks great, Mum. It needs flowers. Anita likes flowers. You take good care of us. You've always taken good care of me. I'll get some flowers. Yes. Hi, Dad. It's me. It's going to rain. TO ÉMILIE, TO MY FAMILY Subtitles: Eclair Group
