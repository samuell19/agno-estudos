Woman: # I remember how just last December # # We were here together in the cold # # Snow was falling and I heard you calling me # # To meet you by the mistletoe # # And you held me by the fire # # With the lights all on the tree # # When everything was perfect # # Just you and me # # I don't need no presents # # 'Cause my only wish is that you're home for Christmas # # Counting down the se... # Okay, I can't hear my vocals, so can we pump those up a little bit? Yeah. No problem. I'll pump 'em up right now. Uh... Thank you. Here we go. Set? # And you held me by the fire # - # Held me by the fire... # - # With the lights all on the tree # # When everything was perfect # # Just you and me # Okay. I-It's still not up enough. Can you try turning the track down? All right. Consider it pumped up, and I will bring the track down just a little bit for you. - How's that? - Hello. Hello. Okay. Yeah, let's do it. Here we go. # I don't need no presents # # 'Cause my only wish is that you're home for Christmas # Okay, sorry. Can you take the click out? Taking the click out. Thank you. Anything else? No, that's it. Thanks. # Favorite carols and the sound of sleigh bells # # Running through the city and the night # # Fingers frozen, but your arms were open # # So you pulled me close and wrapped me tight # # And you held me by the fire # # With the lights all on the tree # # When everything was perfect # # Just you and me # # I don't need no presents # # 'Cause my only wish is that you're home for Christmas # # Counting down the seconds # 'Cause I need your kisses # # So come home for Christmas # # To me # That was really nice, Chance. Your grandfather'd be really happy for you over this one. You good? You don't wanna do one more run-through? No, I'm good. We should do one more for safety. I said I'm good. Merry Christmas. I'm doing everything I can to be there. Aw, man. Uh, can she talk? How's she doing? No, don't worry about it. Just... Yeah, just let her rest. Yeah, I'll call later. Yeah, I love you, too, Dad. Ah, it's about damn time! Somebody get me a sparkling water! Here you go. Mom, I swear that is the last time I sing that stupid Christmas song. What? Everyone loves that song. Because my image needs to be rock 'n' roll! I'm so sick of this Christmas thing! This Christmas thing is what got you here. Hey, what's up? How'd it go? Uh, cancel my flight home. And when's my meeting with Trevor Grossman about the new album? Chance, it's been, like, an hour. You know I'm working on it. And? And I'm trying really hard. Why are...Why cancel the flights? What happened? Well, because we need to be here for when Roger sets up the meeting. We need to be here? Chance... with Christmas happening, I don't think anyone's gonna be available till, like, the 27th, and my mom is really having a hard... Brian, get it done. Now get out. Need some quiet. Chance, please. You don't understand. All I need is a few days to see my mom. Oh, you can leave whenever you want. Thank you. I can't tell you how much that means to me. It's just gonna be really hard to get a new assistant, especially this time of year, but if you really need to... Nah, just... I'll stay. Good. Great. Brian, what's up, man? We gotta talk about that scheduling for Chance... Cory, I can't talk right now. Sorry. ...scheduling. Come on. Jason! How's my favorite male pop star? Coo...We gotta talk about the Europe tour, baby! Hey, I'm family. - Hell of a day. - Hey, baby. Mmm. Hey, Nate, why don't you hang out in the car? I'll let you know when I need you. Copy that. Nate, I really need to speak to Ja... Great. Great. - I hate that song. - Ahh. - I keep telling Cory not to... - I know. Mine, too. They had me do the bridge, like, 40 times, like I'm some beginner, so I fired my manager right there in front of them. - You fired Tom? - Yeah. I had to let 'em know who they're dealing with. You put your guard down for one second, and people start thinking they're in control. - What did Tom do? - He set up the session. Haven't you been with him for, like, ever? Let's not talk about that. Hey, no more work, 'cause I have a little surprise for you. I love surprises. Why don't we spend New Year's Eve in Paris? Are you serious? Serious as a heart attack. It'll be the most romantic week. Oh, my God, baby! I love you! Of course. I'm gonna get you a front-row ticket to the show. The show? What show? I'm playing the stadium in Paris. Can you believe that? And you can be my little groupie. Your groupie? Yeah, my sexy groupie. Okay, Jason, not now. My mom's in the other room. Aw, come on. I've been working with these hacks all day long. You texted me to stop by. I know, but I actually just want to be alone, so... You don't wanna spend time with your boyfriend on Christmas Eve? Oh, screw Christmas! What is your problem? I stopped by to be with you. Now you're trying to throw me out? I'm not throwing you out. I'm just tired, and we can see each other tomorrow. Come on. God, don't be like this! I'm not being like anything! Why can't anyone just listen to me? Because you're acting crazy. Oh, I'm crazy now? Just get out. Fine. Eh, have it your way. Uh, Jason, wait! Give her a minute, chief. She's in a mood. Thanks for the heads-up. Hey, you...you wrap up that European deal? Yeah, I told you. Tonight. Your car's ready outside, sir. You got this. Cory! - Hi. - Hi. Now, why is Brian having to get me all my meetings when I have one of the best agents in town? Merry Christmas to you, too. I asked you to get me that meeting last week. And I told you last week that I would get you in with him when he's available. Patience. So, anyway, how'd the recording go today? I can't believe I let them talk me into it. But it is a good paycheck, so I'll take it. Actually, I wanted to talk to you about that. About what? When I picked your mom up at the airport, we were talking, and we were thinking maybe we could donate the proceeds from this to charity. What are you talking about? My cut, too. You know, we give it all away. Look, this paycheck is peanuts compared to your last release. We could easily give it to the less fortunate for Christmas. Hmm. Who exactly is this "we" we're talking about? - What? - This is my money. How dare you and my mother talk about my money behind my back? I-I thought you would love the idea, a-and your mom said that, for Christmas... Oh, for Christmas? I hate Christmas. It's a stupid, unnecessary holiday where I'm expected to buy things for people and pretend I care about them. I'm boycotting this year. Wow. Wow. You know what, Chance? Take a long, hard look in that mirror. You might be surprised what you see. Oh. My car's here. Looks like we're done for the day. They got everything they needed. Do you wanna grab dinner on the way to the airport? - You can. I'm staying. - What? But feel free to take Santa Claus over here with you. - What? - Okay, look, Mom, I know you might not understand this concept, but I have a business to run, and I am the business, so I can't just be running off for no good reason. No good reason? It's Christmas. Everyone's waiting for you. We have a whole party planned for us. Well, then, tell them I said hello. My car's here. Cory, get me that meeting! Don't do this. Your father's gonna be devastated. She's coming. She's coming. Get ready. Get ready. Watch your step. Chance! Hey, Chance! Please sign this! - Hold on. - Chance, please! Take a moment. Say hi to my daughter! Say hi to my daughter? She loves you! Bodyguard: Back up. Sir! Excuse me. It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. I tell you what. You wanna go get some ice cream? Yeah? Want some ice cream? Okay. Let's go. Survive the crowd okay? Yeah, barely. Phew. Merry Christmas, Ms. Love. Man, they really love you. Please. Hey, one thing. If you mistreat your fans, you just might not have any one day. No one's asking for your advice, Brian. Fine. Here. You know what? I'm gonna catch up on your taxes. Disclaimer, you might have to hire a CPA, 'cause we're two years behind already. I can handle my own business. Chance, you really can't keep pushing this off. They're really gonna come after you. Bobby, what's the holdup? Take me home already. We're not waiting for your mom? No. Just drive. How's she gonna get to the airport? We're not going to the airport, Bobby. Are your ears clogged? Drive home now! You're the boss. It's gonna take just a couple of minutes for the fans to clear us a path. Fine. I hate this time of year. No, you don't. You're just hungry. No, you're hangry again. Shut up. My place is just down the street if you want to grab something. Are you serious? No. Fine. I was... was just offering. Your dad had this cute little guy sent to the office. Look at him. I grabbed him off the desk on the way out. Here you go. Thank you. Little guitar. Sir... get rid of this. That wasn't very nice, Ms. Love. You know, he probably had that specially made. I'm not a little girl anymore. So? He's still your dad. He sent that to you, because he loves you. He's gonna notice when he comes to visit and it's not around. I pay you to drive, not give me advice, okay? So, uh, hey, did your mom mention the thing? - You knew about that? - Yeah. I think it's a great idea, giving presents to, like, the kids at orphanages and hospitals, that's amazing. You know how happy they're gonna be? So happy. See? Do you wanna give away all of your money to charity? Actually, yeah. N-Not all of it, but some of it. Good for you. Me? I gotta look out for number one. My music makes people happy. That's how I give back, and that's enough for me. Ah, that's not the Chance I grew up with. You don't even sound like you. Deal with it. Hey, if it's about money, I can make sure there's tax write-offs, charity donations. I'll make sure you save money on it. Brian, just shut your trap, okay? Okay. I was just trying to help. Yeah, I got it. Okay, they're clearing up. We can go now. All right, I'm gonna take a nap. Wake me up when we get there. You got it, Ms. Love. Seriously? All the lights on? What, am I made of money? I'm so firing those cleaning ladies. Really? 500 channels, and there's actually nothing on? Did Brian forget to pay my bill? Oh, no. Oh, wow! It's really you. I-I'm a little starstruck. Um, I-I got you your kale smoothie right here. I put in, um, some extra vitamin shots, an immunity boost, and some extra protein powder, - because, yeah... - Okay. I gotta tell you, I'm a huge fan. - Yeah. - Thank you. No, hey, do you think I could actually get your...your signature on this? You can make it out to Toby? Oh. Yeah, no, my hand's tired. - Your hand is... - I'm sorry, yeah. No. No, don't close it. Please don't. No, no, don't close it. Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. Merry Christmas! There we go. Much better. Aw, man Chance! Chance? Stay away from me. - Chance! - Who are you?! What do you want?! Don't you recognize your own grandfather? Grandpa Jack? You've started to go down a road that leads into the dark. What is going on? How are you here? Wh-Why are you here? Look at you. Look what you've become! It was that delivery guy, Toby, with the kale sm...He spiked my smoothie. That's it. No, no, no, no! This is not a trick. Your time has come. I'm an old man. I need a seat. What? It never gets easier. I have a gift for you. I'm getting a gift? - Mm-hmm. - Okay. Now I know I'm crazy. I've lost it. I'm sitting here, talking to my dead rock-star grandfather. All right, all right. Let's cut to the chase. Let's stop with the chitter-chatter, all right? Let's get to it. Okay. So, ghost of Grandpa Jack, why don't you just give me the gift, and we can wrap this up, 'cause it's freaking me out a little bit. Oh, no, no, no, no. You see, my actions in life have had consequences that have lasted throughout my living years. These contracts became my life, my family... and to them, my soul is bound forever. I must carry these throughout all time, retribution... for a wasted life. - Do you need my help? - No, I don't need your help. That ship has... long gone. Nah. But living for one's self, only for one's self, has a price. I came here to give you this gift, the gift of another chance. Another chance? That's right. Tonight, you'll be visited by three spirits, one of which will reveal themselves within the next hour. You're sending me three ghosts?! That's right, my dear, my gift to my lovely granddaughter. Some gift. Chance, y-you gotta change your ways. If you don't change your ways, you're gonna end up like me! A rock star? No, doomed! Doomed, I tell thee! I lived my entire life for fame, money, fortune, and look where it brought me! Here! When my life should have been about sincerity... humility... kindness, and mercy. Do you hear what I'm saying? Think I just broke something. But it might not be too late for you. Another chance. Oh, man. Grandpa Jack... out. Yeah. There was definitely something in that smoothie. I gotta get out of here. Christmas... lies told to force kids to sit on the lap of a jiggle-bellied pimp in a red velvet suit to capture that Kodak moment, hoping he's real, hoping for rewards, hoping he don't attack, but no time for thought on that. Hang ten on the Net to catch that cyberwave of capitalism, ripping, running, racing through stores to buy more things we can't afford, then wrap them in festive gaudy paper. Oh, we destroy that later. That is how we celebrate, like my inebriated Uncle Jimmy, who, once again, this holiday season, drowns his failed hopes and dreams in a bottle. What a treat, overeat processed meat. St. Nick is a jive turkey from Turkey. No grace, tight space, tight waist, slips down inside your place, eats your cookies and milk, leaves packages under a murdered tree. Rich cat with a pimpish red hat. Did you know that? Celebrate. Joy, excitement, family. Focused on an overweight, out-of-date clown so unrelated, I can't concentrate. Why can't we remember... Hey, good evening. Happy Holidays. Would you like to see a menu? Yeah. ...playing their hand to get the common man to follow their plan. Hey. Uh, merry Christmas. What can I get for you? Cranberry vodka. All right. ...a brand-new rendition of a pagan tradition designed to keep the people in check. And so we celebrate... There you go, little Christmas cheer. Poet: # Love and happiness # Joy, excitement... - # All is calm # - family... # All is bright # # Sleep in heavenly peace # # Sleep in heavenly peace # Mmm, "Silent Night." Hello, doll. Ah, that is just one fine piece of music. Mm, mm, it's a classic. My opinion, Ol' Blue Eyes did it best. I didn't think your generation went in for that kind of thing. It was my grandfather's secret favorite song, so... Now, look, I don't mean to be nosy, but, uh, aren't you Chance Love? Guilty. Oh, well, well, well, Chance. It's an absolute pleasure. I'm Gus. It was nice to meet you, Gus. Mm, well, doll, let me tell you this. With legs like that and a suit like this, we could dance the night away. Okay, thanks, but I'll pass. Ah. Well, that's too bad. What's a nice girl like you doing in a dive like this on Christmas Eve, huh? Shouldn't you be at some big Hollywood shindig in the Hills? Can you please stop talking to me? Oh, I'm sorry. I meant no offense. Well, Merry Christmas. You have yourself a nice evening. Uh, one more thing, doll face. What? What's happening? Where am I? No, no, no, no. Have a drink. Take the edge off. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. This is...This is... This is your childhood home. Mom? Dad? Sweetie, sweetie, no, no, no, no touchie. No, no, can't hear you. Can't see you. It's just us, okay? Yeah, the tree looks really good this year. You did a great job. Mama bear, Papa bear. Gus is the name. Ghost of Christmas Past is my job, though I've never been too keen about that title. I find it too on the nose. Oh, hey, look, look, look, look! A second Chance! A guitar! - Hey, Merry Christmas, sweetie! - Hey! I just got it as I said it. There goes a second Chance, 'cause your... your name is Chance, and... And, yeah, yes, it was corny, okay, but, my God, how could I not have said that? Oh! It's just the one I wanted! Oh, it must be from Grandpa Jack. Grandpa, he's amazing. We told him you'd been taking lessons, sweetie. Ah, Grandpa Jack. Couldn't make Christmas once again, but look at those nice presents he sent. I would have loved him, no matter what. Mm-mm-mm. Let's put away that social media following of yours for now, okay? This is about you, Cherry Bear. Don't call me that. Oh, that guitar, that gift of love. It sure pushed you to practice, huh? Am I wrong about that? Why are we here? Well, you know, being a spirit has some perks. One, I get to help you find your way. And, I consider the most important, the drinks are free! That thing is gonna make me so rich. Okay, I have a notion that you're not exactly getting the point of this, so we might need to do this again. You know what? Let's see it one more time. Chance: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Are we both watching the same ghostly flashback thing? Because what I see is a star in the making. Kiddo, we have got some work to do. Oh, I remember this. This is the day. This is... This is "A.G.T.S.," the show that made me famous. Bingo! You hit that one straight out of the ballpark, sweetheart. But now tell me this. Do you remember everything? But, Mom, what if I forget the words? What if I don't want to do it anymore? Is it too late to tell them not to? You could do whatever you want to do. I don't think you want to quit. Do you? Plus, you're gonna totally kill it. Thanks, Mom. All right. I'm gonna get us some water. Okay. Don't worry, kid. You nail it. Without people like us, some people don't get to eat or... or pay the bills. Like, they depend on us for survival. People like us? Yeah, you know, stars. I don't think so. Well, you look like a star to me. That's really sweet. Let me give you a piece of advice. Always look out for number one. Give them your talent. That's what the people want. Keep the rest for yourself. Do you really think I could be a star? Oh, hello. Who's your new friend? Mom! It's Jason Cleavers. Are you one of the contestants, too? That's cute. I'm the host. I didn't know. And what am I supposed to learn about my mom embarrassing me? It wasn't about... It was about Jason giving you bad advice. You know what? Let's look a little forward. How 'bout a year? Is that Brian? I haven't thought about this in years. Mm, he's thought about it a lot. Yeah? Uh, hi, Mr. Love. I'm here to pick up Chance for the Christmas Eve dance. Brian. Looking sharp, buddy. Hmm. Cherry Bea...Oh. I'm here. Wow. Hi. You look beautiful. Thank you. So do you. Hey, let me get a picture. Mom will kill me if I don't. - Okay. - All right. Get together now. All right, ready? Oh, yeah, that's awesome. All right, listen. Have fun. Drive safe, okay? - You got it, sir. - Dad. 11:00. 11:00. Agh, that dress! What was I thinking? No, no. Shh, shh, shh. This is the cute part. - Right here. - Oh, right there. - Yeah! - Okay. - Oh, my God. - Gotcha. Chance: Thank you. Oh, boy. And now the sad part. Jason? What are you doing here? I got a show tonight, lost my opener. How'd you like to open for me? Are you serious? You wanna be a star? Chance. I'd like to go home now. Even after you broke his heart, he followed you around like a puppy dog. Now he does your bidding without ever a word of thanks. I never meant to hurt him. He's the best friend I've ever had. Do you ever tell him that? I said I'd like to go home now. Mm-hmm. I said now! ...designed to keep the people in check. And so we celebrate. # Love and happiness # Christmas is... joy, family... Okay. Deuces. Are you kidding me? Mm. Hey... that was pretty intense. Never met someone so anti-Santa before. Nah, I love Santa. He... He roasted me last week, so I had to hit him back. You know what I mean? So are you the, uh, entitled rich girl? Excuse me? I-I'm supposed to let you stew in your own guilt, and then you get all scared with anticipation, but, uh, it's not really my style. You know what? I'm good. Hold on, Second Chance. Don't touch me! I got a job to do, and your leaving wouldn't allow me to accomplish that, so why don't you do us both a favor and just drop the "I'm better than everyone" act? Okay, look. I don't know what you're getting at, but I don't even know you! Well, I know you. Fifth grade, you stole a candy bar. Sixth grade, put gum in Cindy Fletcher's hair at recess and blamed it on Frankie Fletcher. Oh, same here. Cheated on a test. Then eighth grade...Hoo! Okay, okay, I get it. You're a stalker, a really committed one. Super impressive, really. I'm a ghost. You got that part, right? If you run, I'll catch you. If you hide, I'll find you. Think of me like you would think of a cold. You got me. I'm gonna be here for a while. You gotta put up with me. Then I'll be gone. You want me to think of you like a cold? That's the best you can come up with? I'm thinking on the fly here. Look, shut up, and let's ride. We didn't go anywhere. You gotta move your feet. If you wanna go somewhere, I'm parked out front. Fine. Okay. So you have some type of ghost magic where you can transport, but we're in your car? I like driving. Well, at least my dreams are creative. Baby, I'm the Ghost of Christmas Present. You're the Ghost of Christmas Presents? Present. - Present! - Oh. Guess you're awake now, huh? Now get on board with the process. Okay, okay. I'm having a nervous breakdown. Wonderful. So, where are we going? Almost there. Where's there? Well, you never gave him a housewarming gift, and you never, ever let your driver drop him off first. Look, can we just be done with all of this? Oh, I can maybe give you something that you want, and you could tell your boss or whoever's in charge that you got the job done? Are you trying to bribe me? Well... Girl, please! Your assistant has nothing in here but condiments and pickles. Are pickles a condiment? What are we doing in my assistant's kitchen? Your choices, boo. My choices? Let's have a look. Hey, Dad. How you guys holding up? Hey, champ. We're doing okay. Did you get that girl to marry you yet? Oh, I don't know. Not yet. Uh, she's, you know, busy. He has a girlfriend? Nope. Uh... my cards are maxed out. Did you send the transfer for the week? Yeah, I-I just sent it. Is that Brian? Oh, hey. Come on. Look who's awake! Hey. There she is! How you doing, beautiful? How they treating you? Um, not too bad. Oh, I'll be dancing out of here tomorrow. How are you, Brian? How's your week been? Aw, my day was good, and I'm fine, Mama. I just wish I was right there, right next to you. I'm sorry I'm not. Don't you worry yourself, sweetheart. We understand. We'll spend Christmas together next year. We are so proud of you. Yeah. Thank you, Mom. Oh. Uh, feeling... No, i-it's all right, It's okay. It's okay. - Just hold on. - Hey, what's going on? I'll get somebody. Is Mom all right? Mom! Sh-She's okay. Uh, the I.V. just popped out. Okay. All right. Just a second, pal. Nurse? Your choices have consequences. My choices? I chose to give him a job. I chose to pay him more than fair wage. I didn't choose to make his mom sick. He sends every dime home. His father spends every moment he can with her at the hospital. He left his job at the plant. Well, then, I'm happy Brian's paycheck allows for him to take care of his family. You think what you pay him is...is taking care of that woman? He sends her everything, and it still barely just keeps her in the hospital. Well, why didn't he tell me that his mother was sick? - He did, several times. - When? When you yelled at him to go get your dry cleaning, when you yelled at him for not getting a reservation at Enzo's, when you yelled at him for using his phone to deposit your royalty check. Yeah, okay. I get it. Father: There we go. All's well that ends okay. Uh, I could probably make it out there within a few... Uh, shoot, Dad. I gotta...I gotta take this. I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay. I love you. Love to Mom. All right, bye. Hey, what's up? Uh... yeah, no, not a problem at all. I-I could rush over there. I could be there in... I could be there in 20 minutes, if that's okay. Okay, yeah, I-I'm rushing over. See you soon. Told you. You suck. I didn't make anybody lose their job or get sick. It's not my fault that the healthcare system in this country's so messed up. What, are you gonna blame that on me, too? Yeah. Shall we? - Goose! - No, no, an eagle. - Uh, duck! A lame duck! - Keep going! You guys know what it is. - Aww! - Aw, no talking! Come on. You can't talk. Sit down. So what held her up this time? Uh, she had a meeting with a big music executive. She's really excited about it. She couldn't schedule it for the day after Christmas? - Come on. Your turn, sweetie. - Okay. - Ready? - Yeah. Um... Bruce, did you cut one? Oh, very funny, Stinky! Uh, smelly! Gross? Yucky? D-Disgusting. It's smelly. Oh! Chance! Chance. Hey, hey, now! Be nice! No, wait. Actually, it's really close enough. Spoiled. Spoiled? They think I'm spoiled? I worked my butt off to get where I am! What about that boy that follows her around, Brian? They dating? I wish they were. He's really good to her. I love him. He's amazing. He's actually her assistant now. - Wow, her assistant. - Hmm. Hey, uh, why don't we get another cheese plate, yeah? Yeah. More cheese, Stinky? Yes, that would be good. - I'll take some wine. - Okay. I know you're disappointed she didn't come, but she's our workaholic little girl. Did you try to call her? Yeah. She isn't answering. Maybe she changed her mind and she's already on the plane. Yeah, maybe. Your father worked hard to keep a roof over your head, put food on the table, clothes on your back. Yeah, and I'm grateful, but I don't owe anyone anything! I'm not talking about money. He wouldn't take it, anyway. She never even so much as calls unless she needs something. - She's such a brat. - Yeah. I mean, she's gotta be worth millions now. It's not like she can't take off the weekend and spend... - Hey, guys. - Hey, hey, you got the cheese. All right, Karen, it's your turn. Get up there, and make a fool of yourself. - All right. All right. - Here you go. There you go. Sorry. - Oh, hey, I'll be right back. - Okay. What the heck? What's the card say? "Merry Christmas. Love, Chance." What? What?! I didn't send them anything! Oh, Brian, that idiot! That was supposed to go to Roger! That guy takes good care of you. What? You need a road map? He's trying to patch up things between you and your parents. If I'd know any better, I'd say he loves you. Let's go set this baby up! Can we go, please? Jason isn't texting me back. Jason, baby, I'm so sorry that I threw you out! Look, how hard is the "no one can see or hear us" part of this? I didn't realize we were still doing the thing. The thing where we transported into the back of a moving vehicle? You missed that? Okay, you have a serious attitude problem. No. I have a woman who won't acknowledge the fact that she has not taken one positive move toward fixing herself. Take a chill pill, okay? You chill! She is still texting me! The nerve. I heard that. I-I made her! God! Without me, she would be doing the fair circuit somewhere in Podunk, Nowhere. She is nothing. Nobody treats J. Cleavers like that, nobody. I'm nothing? You're nothing! You're a has-been pop star with one good album, maybe! And three of the songs sucked. Ah, there she is. Who's she? Oh, you wouldn't dare! I can't believe this is happening! This is amazing. Thank you so much. Merry Christmas to me! Ooh! Jason Cleaver, if you are cheating on me, I'm gonna wring your scrawny little neck! You hear me? There's nothing you can do now! Jump pump your brakes! Chill out! So, uh, what are these questions you have for me? Okay, how do I get an agent? Also, who's your agent, and do I take the band with me to meetings? And how do I get my demo out? Should I send emails, or is it better to send hard copies? - Who do I talk to about... - Okay, whoa. First thing that I do is breathe, relax. Excitement shows your lack of experience, so be bold. Demand their attention. There's a certain kind of decorum expected from people like us. People like us? He wouldn't. Stars. I'm not a star. You look like a star to me. Oh, you skeeze-ball! You used that line on me. Oh, you are a piece of garbage! Nice mentor you got there. You're such a lucky girl. I don't need him. My album's gonna outsell his. My fans are gonna tear him apart. Your fans? Wow. You just take me to the nicest of places. Remember that pathetic fan with her daughter that was trying to get your autograph, just dying to meet you? Oh, no, please. Can we just go home, okay? Look, I get it. I know what you're trying to tell me. That autograph would have been the only treat she could give her daughter this year. Great. Wonderful. Um, I didn't know that you were gonna be so late tonight. I-I have to be at Christmas tomorrow at 9 A.M. with my parents. I'll pay you double. You don't have to do that. No, it's holiday pay. Um, I get paid on Friday. Is that all right? I mean, okay. I mean, but what time are you gonna be back tonight? I don't know, but please, please just stay. I can't miss this shift. I-I already swapped so that I could take Becca to go see Chance Love. Oh, how was the concert? Oh, we didn't get to see her play. Just to try to get an autograph. We don't have the money for tickets right now. Um... maybe you should find some other child care. I can't afford day care. I mean, I can't work for free. I mean, I would if I could, but I've gotta pay my bills, too. I know. I know. Please just watch her for today. And I'll pay you on Friday for next week in advance, I promise. Okay, but if Friday doesn't happen, you're gonna have to find another sitter. - A-And you understand, right? - Oh, I do. Oh, God, I do. Um, I gotta go. Thank you. Thank you. I'll be back in the morning. Um, thank you. I really do appreciate you. Okay, bye. What a sweet woman. Okay, now can we go home? Becca. Girl, you gotta go to sleep. Come on. Why don't you lay down? Besides, tomorrow is Christmas, and Santa is not gonna come if you aren't asleep. Mama says Santa can't come this year. Well, adults don't know everything, so why don't you hush up and get some sleep? And I betcha he might just have something for you in the morning. You think so? Well, you don't know if you don't go to sleep. I'm gonna leave this one on for you. Good night, girl. It's not like my autograph would have paid for their bills. You're right. It's worthless. But it would have made that little girl's Christmas just a little bit brighter. Well, my agent told me that I can't just sign everything that gets shoved in my face. Otherwise, it devalues my autograph, and I wouldn't get to sign at conventions. I see. It's your agent's fault. Let's see what he has to say. Yep. That blonde little tyrant wants me to get her a meeting with Roger Grossman of Grossman Records. - Is he talking about me? - Nope. Brought you here to listen to him talk about someone else. No, I did not call him. She's a diva. I don't want him thinking I work with crazies. But now her assistant's trying to get her a meeting, so I don't know what to do. He didn't call? Oh, he's so fired! You said you'd been waiting to hear back! You think he's the problem? You think he didn't want to make a new album so he can earn his cut? I think he's lost his mind if he's not gonna get me in to see Grossman! If she messes this up, I'm cutting all ties. She treats me like hell, anyway. Oh, you think I treat you like hell now? You just wait until I get ahold of you! I'm gonna tear you a new one! You ever sent him a thank-you note for everything he's done? A Christmas gift? Ask him how his day is? Take him to lunch? No? Do you take any other stress meds? 'Cause I've been popping these like Tic Tacs, and I really don't see a difference. Whoa, Grandma! Aren't those illegal? Ah, anyway, I will see you at Christmas breakfast. Yep, I know. It's late. Gotta get back to the wife and kids. Okay. Merry Christmas. Love you, too. Good night. That's his grandma. I have a totally different relationship with mine. He's married? He has kids? How long has he been your agent? Ever since I first started. You suck. Yeah, you mentioned that. Hey, babe. Yeah. Yeah, I know. I-It's so late. Look, I-I've just been trying to close Cleaver's deal for the Europe tour. Yeah, okay. Uh, I'll be home in 15 minutes. I love you, too, babe. Wow, he has really gotta get his life together. I see why you're so popular. Okay, look, I have had enough of this. - Is that it? - Yes. How dare you come into my life and judge me? What gives you the right to kick a girl when she's down, huh? Are you perfect? I'm an angel. Hello? Any more ghosts? I have a stick! What am I doing? Get out! Get out! I don't want to do this anymore! I didn't ask for any of this! I'm gonna call the police! - 911. What's your emergency? - Yes! Yes! I have an emergency! I have a stalk... Hello? Of course. I am the third. What, did you die at Comic-Con? You will follow. Okay. Just let me get dressed. You will follow. Okay. Right. Jeez. Okay. Okay, right. Just... Whew. Hold on. You just had the... And...And you...Blehh. And now you... You gotta admit, pretty scary, right? What is going on? Ooh, the old tricks are the best tricks. Got your attention. You're trying to scare me? Literally the only thing that I hope to do. I don't understand. You will get but one view. You will not speak unless prompted. You will not move unless told. You will not get another chance. Girl, you must have seriously screwed up. Mm. Okay, let's do this, then. Let's get it over with. Wh-What is this? Oh, please. Don't be a fool. It's time to prove you're worth the effort. Don't waste this. A Christmas gift like this only comes once in a lifetime. Okay, yeah. I got it. So where we going? Remember in Hawaii? We pestered her until we got her to try skimboarding. Again? I've been here already. And she fell, bruised her butt so bad. Yeah, I remember. And she didn't sit for two days. Did she, uh... Did she go peacefully? In her sleep. She died? She dies? What happened? I come for her two weeks before next Christmas. Dad, stay as long as you want, all right? Your mom would be proud of you... taking care of your old man. Man, it's so strange referring to her in the past tense. Yeah. I... I still wake up at night... expecting her to be next to me. God. Ah, sorry. - Dad, don't worry about it. - Sorry. Just let it all out, okay? Let it all out. I'm sorry I wasn't there. She knew you loved her. How 'bout I make us uh, some tea, yeah? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. He's not even there when she passes? So now you care? This isn't real! None of this has even happened! Y-You're a liar! This is some sick joke that... A joke? The weak and foolish tempt me. The brave laugh in my face. I am eternal. I am the constant! All will come to me in the end! I speak only truth! Why are you showing me all this? This? This is the result of your uncaring greed, your self-importance... your complete blindness to the plight of others who genuinely... care about you. You have one hope. Chance... open your heart. Announcer: Welcome back to "Dance or Bust," where former celebs... - What is this? - Is that me? - ...social media has-been... What happens to me? Karma, fate, call it what you want. Shane, what did you think of today's performances? Yeah, no, I know, Mom. I wish I could be there, too, but I'm just so swamped with work right now. Hi, Dad. Hi. Merry Christmas. No, I know. I'm...I'm so sorry. I really gotta go. Okay, all right. I love you. O-Okay, bye. So sad. Our judges have made a final decision. With the lowest score recorded in the history of "Dance or Bust," former teen pop icon Chance Love has officially been eliminated in the first round of the competition. Seems like the judges have been pretty harsh on her. The judges? Life's been harsh on her, and it's not letting up any time soon. I do a celebrity dance show? Aw, jeez. Who are you to judge? Not everyone does it to pay their lawyer. My lawyer? What do I need a lawyer for? There's a price for living only for yourself, and the bill comes due. Thank you, guys, so much for watching and tuning in to "Dance or Bust." Yeah, uh... - Chance Love? - Yes. I'm Agent Harris with the FBI. You're under arrest for tax evasion. - Cuff her. - What? This is ridiculous! Miss, I need you to turn around, put your hands behind your back. Oh, my God! There's no way that happens! Oh, but it does. ...against you in a court of law. No! No! Get off of me! - Stop resisting! - No! Ow! You understand these rights? Yes, I do! I freaking want an attorney. Oh, I'm gonna lawyer up so hard, and you're gonna be so screwed! You have no idea! I hope you like your job, because you're gonna miss it! Ow! I'm gonna wear your badge like a belt buckle! Officer: Get in! You'll be sorry. I'm Chance Love. You have no idea what you're doing! Charming. You can't treat me like this. Ah, whatever. Are you kidding me? I get arrested on Christmas? What kind of a horrible person arrests someone on Christmas? Aw, sweetie pie, you ain't seen nothin' yet. Let's go. Let's take a trip further down the rabbit hole. Jail? I'm in jail? What's going on? Okay, look. Now I know you're lying, because my lawyer would never let me rot in jail. You are so full of it. You got 18 months. Prison ain't no joke. Toughens you up a little bit. I've been in jail a year? Mm-hmm. I'm broke? What? You're untouchable? The rules don't apply to the great Chance Love? Turns out Uncle Sam doesn't agree. # 'Cause my only wish is # # To go home for Christmas # Prisoner 23582, step back from the bars. It's time for your scheduled visitation. Please step out. - Are they... - Walk! Oh! He shoved me! He can't shove me! I am so tired of you. Shut up. Open your eyes. Maybe you'll actually learn something. Well, who am I visiting with? Thanks for all the help. Ms. Love, I'm sorry to inform you that your visitors were unable to make it. Miss? N-No, they said they're coming. Look, you're not the only prisoner whose family didn't show up. Now please stand up. They're gonna come, okay? They're coming. Miss, let's go. No. They're coming. - Miss, come on. - They're coming. - Let's go. - They're gonna come, okay? They're coming. I'm sure they just got held up at the airport. It's the holidays, so... Yeah. The holidays. I'm sure that's exactly what it is. I guess I'd have to say that this beautiful flower is my inspiration. Career gone. Family gone. Looks gone. Money gone. You wither. You never marry. You never travel. You never leave the house. But this is just a possible outcome if everything goes a certain way, right? It's not definite. You spiral. You lie to family and friends. You sit right there. You watch as the world forgets you. Okay, I'm ready to go back now. Can you just please take me back? Mm-mmm. One last stop. All the furniture is included if you want. And this is this fantastic master bedroom. And right off to the side here is the bathroom. I like that tub. If you guys follow me right over here, I'm excited to show you this spacious backyard. So I sell my house? Great. You didn't sell it. What do you mean? The house's previous owner was recording artist Chance Love. - Oh. - Who...Who is that? - Honey, he's in The Roots. - Oh. No. She did one of those reality shows once. It's a quite sad story, actually. Anyway, follow me this way. I'm gonna show you this fantastic, beautiful kitchen... What's the sad story? Be careful what you ask of me. You cannot unsee your fate. What happens to me? Ms. Love? Ms. Love, can you hear me? Can you hear me? The air bag did a number on her. We need to clear her airway. Get her head back. What's happening? The crash threw you clear of your car. She's shaking. Hold her still. I can't get the I.V. in. Do I die? Is this how I die? I don't believe you. You're liars! I want to go home. I want to go home right now. Check the other victim's pulse! What other victim? Brian? What is he doing here? He was in the passenger seat. Never abandons you. Sticks by your side to the very end. He doesn't die, okay? He doesn't die. Take me, okay? Take me instead, but he doesn't die! Take me instead! I'm sorry. He's gone. Time of death, 2:27. He does not die. He does not die. I'm sorry. Okay, let's get her going. Okay, let's get her back. - Let's get her back. - Chance: Take me instead. - Charging at 360! - Take me. Take me instead. Charging. Clear! Shocking! Chance: Don't die. Take me instead. Take me instead. Please. Please, no. I'll change. I swear. Please just give me one more chance. Hey! You all right? We're here. Sorry. Traffic was really bad. Brian? You're alive?! Yeah, last I checked. Thank you! Wait! What...What day is it? It's Christmas Eve. Wow, that must have been one heck of a nap. Really? I didn't miss it? No, you only been asleep, like, less than an hour. What? Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome? H-Hey, are you feeling okay? I've never felt better in my whole life! Well, that's good. That's amazing. Wow, I'm so happy how happy you are. Hey, guess what? While you were asleep, Ron Grossman called. He wants to set up a phone meeting ASAP. Can you come inside with me for just five minutes? - Sure. - Okay. Is that okay, if you just wait for five minutes? Fine with me. Thank you. I appreciate that. Hey, you sure you don't want me to get Roger on the phone again? No. Come with me. Okay. All right. What's going on? What you doing? Okay. Oh, good, good, good! I found them! Right. What? What are they? Come on! What...What are you up to? Airplane ticket vouchers. Okay. You going somewhere? Uh-uh. We are. We're going home. Seriously? Mm-hmm. Come on. You need a bag or something? Jason? What up, girl? Great news! I got us the deal! I talked to Grossman! He wants us to produce a duet album, media gold mine. You will not believe the money! Time to celebrate! Seriously? A duet with you? Heck, yeah. Get on in. Aw, Chance... Jason... this just isn't working out. Are you sure? Come on. Babe? You laughing at me? I always hated that guy. Airport, please. You're the boss. I can't believe this is happening. Cory? Hi. It's Chance. Look, I am so sorry for how I've acted with you, and I know I've been a slave-driving diva, but I really need a favor. I know it's really late on Christmas Eve, but please. Hello? Hello. Merry Christmas! Uh, oh. I'm sorry. Can I help you? I'm sor... What are you doing? Look, I don't live here. I'm just the sitter. Actually, I'm looking for you. Uh, for me? I have no clue what you said to her, but thank you. Uh, to who? Uh, these are all for the little girl, and we have one more that needs to be special ordered. I'm sorry. I don't understand. And this is for you. My client instructed me to give you this. She's paying for your services to this household. A-Are you kidding? I mean, this is three times what I make in a year. Well, Merry Christmas! Wait. Um... Di... Did anyone else see that? Merry Christmas. Mom? Dad? Mom? Dad? - Cherry Bear, hey! - Hey! Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Yeah! I'm so sorry I'm late. I love you guys so much! I'm so sorry for how I've treated you and how I've acted. Aw, don't worry about it. You're right on time. - Are you gonna stay? - Yeah. We're gonna spend Christmas as a family. Ah, yes. Okay. I have an idea, and I need your guys' help. It's gonna sound a little crazy. Excuse me. Uh, where Mrs. Barnes' room? Are you friend or family? I'm a friend. Oh, you just missed visiting hours. It's, uh, family only. Oh, my gosh. You're Chance Love! Yeah, in the flesh. I follow you on Instagram. That is so sweet. Thank you. Look, I'm sorry. A-Are you a paramedic? Th-That's just so weird that you would ask that. I'm actually training to become one, hoping to move out west and hop on an E.R. unit. I have a feeling you'll do really well. Thanks. Look, is there any way that you could sneak me into my friend's room? I mean, it is Christmas. Well, I'm not supposed to, but I'm happy to make an exception this time. - I'll show you where. - Great. Oh, wait. Okay, um... this is for the children's wing, but don't tell anyone who it's from. You're an absolute angel. Administration is gonna freak! Okay, one more favor. Uh, come here. I just don't understand. I thought you said you couldn't come. I mean, we're so happy that you're here, but what about your job? Yeah, Mom, I can stay as long as I need to, paid, and she gave me a raise. Oh, my... What a wonderful girl. Well, I'll be. It looks like I'm gonna have to get you a pig to kiss, son! You know, he's right. I did promise, so, yeah, you go ahead, and find that pig, 'cause I will kiss it! Am I interrupting? Chance? What are you doing here? Brian, I asked, am I interrupting? No, I don't believe you are. Great. Come on in, guys! Let's go. Hey, all right. Merry Christmas! Yeah, Merry Christmas! Brian: Thank you! You guys shouldn't have. Wait. Chance, I can't believe you did all this. Well, you've done so much for me, and I've never even said thank you, so I just wanted to show you how much you mean to me. Well, it's incredible. Thank you so much. I donated all of the proceeds from the single to the children's wing, and all of your mom's bills are paid for. Thank you. Thank you. You are amazing. Becca! Come here! Yes, Katherine? Come here. Hurry. Look! Who brought them? I think an angel. # I remember how just last December # # We were here together in the cold # # Snow was falling, and I heard you calling me # # To meet you by the mistletoe # # And you held me by the fire # # With the lights all on the tree # # When everything was perfect # # Just you and me # # I don't need no presents # # 'Cause my only wish is that you're home for Christmas # # Counting down the seconds # # 'Cause I need your kisses # # So come home for Christmas to me # # Our favorite carols and the sound of sleigh bells # # Ringing through the city and the night # # Fingers frozen... # We did all right, huh? Yeah, we did. Not too shabby. Hmm. # And you held me by the fire... # I could go for Chinese. Mmm. I could eat. Sure, but no fusion. Ooh. No. No, no, no. Pickles a condiment? Mm, as a purist, I'd say no. You know, to me, it's the ketchups, it's the mayos, it's the relishes. - Then again... - Technically, relish is... Exactly. It's just chopped up pickles, so... # Counting down the seconds # # 'Cause I need your kisses # # So come home for Christmas to me # No! I thought we were done with all of this! I learned my lesson! I swear! I just have one more thing to show you. You'll like this. Becca, look! It's for you! Oh, she got it. I hope she likes it. Just watch. Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness! Mommy, I love Christmas! Oh, sweetie. I love you. Ohh. I love you, too, sweetheart. Thank you. Well done.
