Your hands are beautiful. You play the piano? Not really. Mind if I join you? Allan. Jane. The way you're tapping the table you should play the piano. Do you live here? Born here. Raised here. Stuck here. Well I'm just passing though. Want another? Okay. Well. I'm in insurance I insure farm machinery. You have beautiful eyes, Jane. I'm trying to think of an interesting question about farm machinery. There aren't any, trust me. - No? - No. - So what are we gonna talk about? - You. You're interesting. I can tell. So, what brings you to this bar? I live around here. Nothing on TV Monday night. Tell me, Jane, what do you do in life? Apart from being disappointed by TV. Not to much.. What is it, some kind of secret? It's not a secret. What? You must do something. I am a singer. I wasn't far off with my piano question. The night is young, we're just getting started. How about a game of pool? Alright, if you do not mind losing. We'll see about that. I didn't realize how late it is. I gotta get home. Something wrong? No, I'm just afraid I gotta be somewhere. Thanks for the beer. I remember pickin' a wild orange at the edge of the woods surrounding our house. I threw the orange right at the stars, and it never fell back. I held that fruit for a second. Today, I look at the orange tree through the window of a dark train... and... Seems like it is painted on the glass. Are you sure? It was a crisis. If I were an angel I wouldn't let things like that happen. - Alright. - See you tomorrow, Mike. - Alright. - Get up, Joey. Get up. Want a ride home? No. I'll walk. Be careful who you bother with your bullshit. It's not... it's not... it's not bullshit. I knew you'd still be awake. You tore your shirt. I know. I don't want to share like talking tonight. I've got something I want to show you. I found this. Ever listen to it? Why don't you go home, Joey? We've got big plans for tomorrow, right? Good night. You have a bathing suit underneath? Many too many people are here! Now that's a fashion statement. You look like some dorky superhero. And I'll make you my sidekick. - Show me what you've got. - I don't feel like it. - Come on wheels! - No! Come on! Do not be shy. They told me you are very sexy on the stage. Forget it. Give me my candy back. Put on your suit. Want some candy... Put your suit on. Suit on. Red suit. Oh come on, I want to feel the water. I bet it's not even that cold. Could you feel? Okay! Let's go out, let's get out. Be careful. Hurry... Be careful! Shit, Joey! - It was on purpose. - Okay. Joey, I'm fine. Calm down. Come on come on. Stop it. Nobody died. Nobody died, there's no crisis. Stop, okay? I gotta tell you something. I saw an ad... in the paper yesterday. And guess who's givin' a special talk in New Orleans next week? Who? Jeff Noffray.

You know how I feel about all that crap Joey. Yeah, but didn't you even look at it? I mean, didn't you even look at it? Because if you looked it, you'll know it is not crap, Jane. When I met you at the hospital, you were in bad shape And I listened to you talk about your angels, crap, and your dumb ghosts because I knew that you needed to But shit, Joey, it's been seven years! You need to get over it now. - Don't lecture me. - I'm not lecturing you, Joey. - It's just the truth. - Do you think I'm crazy? - Just look at yourself. - What about me? If I didn't come and get you up everyday, you'd just stay in bed until you die. Oh shut up, Joey. You know anything. - You hide from the world because... - Shut up. ...you have two wheels instead of legs. - Shut up, Joey! - You don't sing anymore... Shut up! You're barely alive.

Do I look sick? You bastard! You son of a bitch! I broke all my dishes! This smashed up my whole house! Whatta you think, I'm just loaded and I can just buy all new stuff every time you freak out?

So, where are you headed? New Orleans. Then Baton Rouge. I've been traveling with Jane. She's a singer. We travel together but we are not... together. I mean, we are together, but we're just friends. She's pretty. You on tour? In a way. And you? My husband disappeared. He was there, and then one evening, disappeared. No one. It's been a month, and... I haven't heard anything from him. No calls. I've got one minute left on this stupid phone for him, but... no ring yet. I went to the warehouse where he worked, and they said they haven't had any news either, and that... If he didn't show up in a week... hire a new man. I don't know where he's at. I don't think he went to the Moon Don't worry. I saw the angel wings on your back. It's a sign. I did that myself. I like angels. Sorry. Sorry! It's alright. I won't break. I don't think. Here we go. Now, I'd like to propose a toast. As you know, Dale, Chris, Suzie and I have recently won first place in the state's fireworks competition. Yes! Yes! Thank you. Okay, which means, that we are very happy to be able to say to Jake here this evening, that the entire $5000 prize will go to his charity to help soldiers' families. But, to tell you the truth the toast that I'd like to propose this evening, is not to us Why not? Toast us! We deserve it. The toast that I'd like to propose tonight, is to my little sister, Billie. I know times have been hard, but take heart, You'll always have a home here with me. And welcome, Joey and Jane. Cheers. Cheers. Jane, did I hear you're a singer...? I used to be in a band, but that was a long time ago. A long time ago. Jane. Jane she has a gig in a few days in Baton Rouge. Really? - Baton Rouge? - In a club? No, I definitely don't have a gig. But if she did have a gig, it would be great! - I bet you would. - And what do you do Joey? - I am Jane's bodyguard. - Really? No! I'm a fireman, I mean I'm an ex fireman, I used to be a fireman. Seriously? Yes, I fought fires. That's exactly what we need on here for our surprise tonight. - Norah! - What? - Wait. What a surprise? - Curiosity killed the cat. - But the satisfaction brought him back? - It's a surprise. Said so, but I think you're gonna have to wait like everyone else. You'll like it, believe me. I'm gonna walk for a bit. Uh... do you wanna come with me? Come on, I'll show you the well. Some French wine? - This way. - Okay. Jane? Sure, thank you. Not very deep. It's a wishing well. My father had it made to amuse us when we were little. I used to come out here when I really wanted something. I like close my eyes and make my wish. Really, I don't know where my husband could have disappeared to. You should come with us to New Orleans. There's a guy. A specialist in talking to ghosts. You can get them to find your husband. He can help you. I know he can. I know. Thank you, Joey. Guess we're all missing something. Let's make a real wish. - Do you got any... - Oh, yeah. Oh, that was loud! Okay, everybody get up and very calmly go over by the swing Dale and Suzie to behind the scenes Take your drink "I can I drive you? The ground is a little muddy. I don't know, you got a license for that? Oh, I can drive a tractor It hard can this be? I'm in good hands. Who's excited? Alright alright, it's just a little surprise. Not much. - You ready? - Ready. Alright, I've gotta get going, but the lady for the bus will be here in just a few minutes. It was very nice for you to drive us this far. I happy for the company. Tell my sister I'll be okay, and the fireworks were amazing. - Apple pie? - Thank you. Oh, and the check please. My purse. I must have left my purse in the car! Here's your check. I did. I left my purse in the car. Too late. $ 37. I don't have anything. $ 16. I'm broke. The bus is here. Sorry. I have a plan. I've done this before. The key is, separate. That's the basis of this whole operation. Billie, you're gonna go to the bathroom, and you're gonna wait. I'm gonna get the bags and the guitar, and I'm gonna go out of the restaurant, first... What do I wait for in the bathroom? Wait. Because I'm gonna go out calmly to the bus. I'm gonna get on and stay on. But somebody's got to stay here, right here, til the very last moment. They won't suspect anything because Billie, you come out of the bathroom and go straight out of the restaurant. Jane, you'r gonna see me get on the bus, and you're gonna count ...to 30. And then, you're gonna come out and join us like nothing ever happened. Okay? Let's go for it! It is assumed that I get up first? Yes, he was supposed to take the bags too. - What do we do? - Take the bags and go. Discreetly. Sorry. Sorry. Let me give you a hand, ma'am. Where do you need to go? The bus. You know, my sister is in a wheelchair but she never lets me push her. It's leaving. - Stop! - Let me handle this. Stop the bus, in the name of the law! Hang on tight. Stop the bus! - I've always wanted to do this. - No problem. - Here you go. - When you stole the car, did you get to check the engine? I don't think so. I didn't have enough time When? When did you have time to check the engine? - Did you change the oil? - Don't blame me. - Well that's not the point anyway! - Well what really is the point? Hey hey. You get out without paying any money then you start bawling each other out! Get out of my bus. Now! The point is, I was almost was arrested. But you weren't and we're all okay. No, thanks to him. It would have worked if you guys just had of done it right. What? You screwed up. And now we're all stranded here in the middle of God knows where! We're in Cairo. Well guess what? I don't want to be in Cairo. I didn't even want to come on this stupid trip. Well, you're gonna thank me for this later. Thank you? Asshole! Thank you for what? For what? We're all up shit creek! We're on this trip for you too, believe me. Shut up, Joey! I don't want to hear another one of your theories about how I need to find myself by the grace of whatever. Stupid angels hanging over my head. I'm done! I'm done Joey. I quit. - You've gotta start living again, Jane. - Stop trying to rescue me! And you gotta go see your son. What? I found this letter that he sent you. It is an invitation to his communion party. In Baton Rouge. If I had of told you, you never would have gotten in the car in the first place. Read this. I don't want to. It is true that your father died in a car accident? He died when I was 3. And your first mother... did she die with your first father? - No. - Then why do you have a new mother? Because the first one is sick, and she couldn't take care of me after the car accident. - Why? - she was in a coma. What's that? It's worse than being asleep. And when you wake up, your brain's changed, and you can't give love anymore. A week later, they told me I'd never walk again. His mom helped our a lot, when she was alive. When she passed away, I just... ...I guess I went crazy. The state put Devon in Foster Care. Seven years now. He's inviting you. It's time to start over again. I don't have a job, and I got no money, I don't have a nice home. I wouldn't even know what to say to him. Joey says you're gonna sing him a song. No, that's not gonna happen. Do you know Joey a long time? Since the accident, when they put me in the psych ward. What was he doing in the psych ward? There was a fire, in the subdivsion where Joey's family lived, and He saw his parents, and his sister and his little niece die. His ghosts are his angels, or whatever... It's them that he talks to. Do you hear music over there? Yeah. If there is music, I'll bet there'll be food. We're stranded, and we heard your guitar. I'm Billie and, this is Jane and Joey. Come in. He sent ya. You know who sent us? He sent ya. He sent ya and you don't even know it He heard the guitar that's why he sent ya. Who? You know all about Clarksdale? Why Robert Johnson met with the devil. Robert Johnson? He was a traveler, like you. Stranded, lost, a night like tonight. It was 1932 and young Robert had been walking for hours with his guitar on his back, and he was lost. and as far as he could see and saw trees lining the road that were black as coal. That's when he seen, the cross. Not knowing what direction to go, he decided to spend the night where the 4 roads met. As he was starting to fall asleep, the birds of the night went quiet and a fresh breeze woke him. he looked up and a dark shadow appeared in the night sky cloaked in a black cape, and a large hat. a human like form descended upon him. The creature reached across Robert grabbing his guitar, and with long thin, terrifying fingers tuned it to a sound that never been imagined before and dropped it by Robert's side. Now Robert Johnson had just signed a pact that would make him the most extraordinary blues man that ever lived all he had to do, was trade his precious soul. - I really like this cake. - Yeah. I'm still hungry. I gotta tell ya, there's something special about this cake. It can make you may feel happy, or sad. Or it can make you feel huge, or tiny. My father used to say that every spot in the world has it's own particular vibration. This was my grandparent's garden. And hundreds of years before them, it was the garden of the Choctaw and Quapaw tribes. this was one of the world's gardens. the garden where you can dream. In the Bible, it's called the Garden of Eden which in Hebrew means, the Garden of Pleasure. We can understand the world if we look at it from here. We are all innocent in this garden. We can be reborn here every evening. Mom... Mom.. I don't know how to live with that. The things that I've lost. I know. But I would just like to be able to walk again. What are you doing? Got a couple Screws loose? Just a couple. Hey, I've got a proposal for you. Coming from the guy who changes his license plates soon as he wakes up...? Come on, thats... you know, it's nothing. Straight up. Are we leavin'? Caldwell wants to get you in a little moretrouble first. No... no. I've got a gig, it's way south of here, and I got this singer, and she can't make it. So if I show up alone I lose a gig. So I want her to sing. Come on. It's just two songs. We'll split fifty to fifty. Then I'll drive you guys the rest of the way to New Orleans. That sounds like a great plan. I'll drop you off here because I've got some business to do. but the Rose Inn Hotel is right up the street, and I'll meet you there at 9 o'clock sharp. Just two songs. You're gonna be amazing. Did you decide what song you're gonna do? - I can't wait to hear you. - I'm not going to do it. - You can do it. - I can't. Yes you can. You're super wheels, remember You can do anything. Do you want me to break out cape would ya? I not gonna do it just because you've decided that I should, - okay? - Where you going? Leave me alone.

Tonight we have a real special treat for the Rose Inn Hotel, a great singer... Jane Wyatt. Sorry I'm late, I was in the park. had a lot on my mind. I met Jim and Carol, they're on their way to Iowa. Carol is dying and they're taking one last trip to say goodbye to their friends and to each other. They don't travel, behind windows on buses or trains. Nothing is painted the glass for them. This is for them... ...and anybody who's who's trying to make their way. Oh... you sang right to the heart, just like a bird. An out of practice unrehearsed bird. Ah, they come in all shapes and sizes. Whoever heard of a bird, that has lost it's voice? We must be getting close. - You said you're from New Orleans,? - Yep Where were you when the storm hit? You've got to be kidding! Joey. Joey! - What? - That car. Right there. It's him! - Yes, it's him. - It's him! - What's happening? - Yes, that's our car. - Slow down, what the hell going on? - He stole our car!

I don't know Caldwell, just stop! - Drop the gun! - Take the wheel. - No! - Take the wheel! - Stop! - I'm was just shootin' at his. Stop! Come on. Be serious.

Hands on your head. Get in the car now. Get in the car now! I can't move my legs! - Get out of the car! - I can't move my legs! Put your hands behind your back! We need an ambulance! Don't take me to the hospital, did you hear me! Alright, calm down. - I'm gonna die! - Nobody is going to die. - The ambulance is on it's way. - Shut up! Up against the car. Help her up against the car. I'm paralyzed! - I won't go to a hospital... - Next to the car! - Shut up! Shut up! - Put them in the car. Nothing is clear in our world. Nothing happens the way we expect it to. Caldwell was a musician and barman. After the levees failed, he lost everything. His house, his job, his way. His whole life went under water. He found other ways to survive. The police typed out his crimes on a sheet of paper. They noted that he had saved his neighbors during the flood but there are no excuses. The reasons come in all shapes and sizes. Cells aren't the best places to spend the night right now. Gather your things and make it quick. But what about our testimony? We have your statement, You're better off not asking questions. And New Orleans has enough vagrants already, I suggest you move along... Your friend is in San Patricks Hospital. They say he'll pull through. - Can we see him? - No, no. He's headed back to prison as soon as he's out of danger. Will you give him this? I can't. It's just a song. Caldwell, Do you know the black oropendola, or the goldfinch Tengmalm's owl that lives in a forest of spruces you ever heard of the zebra finch or seen a blue cervert hummingbird? Look at this one. It lives along the rivers. It fishes at dusk when it's shadows disappears. Did you know that the scarlet ibis' color comes from the shrimp it eats? Isn't that funny? Look at this one... a green and ruthless kingfisher. It's songs like two stones knocking together. Some say they've heard it sing differently. Nobody looks at it much anymore, but the house sparrow... it doesn't migrate, it stays in it's neighborhood and eats at the local restaurant. This is the little wing sova they say that it's song is sad. On the ground, it runs so fast that it's legs become invisible. Whatta you think of that? It's Jeff Noffray! He's here. He's here. Excuse me, Sorry, excuse me, sorry. Mr. Noffray! Mr. Noffray! It's such an honor. You are... uh... ...a magician, really. - Good to meet you. I can see, you have the angel aura about you. You all do. I'll see you inside. Before the talk you've all been waiting begins... we've got a little surprise for you. now, they've been rehearsing for two weeks now. So sit back, and get ready to dream a little. Let's give it up, for the students of the San Bernardo School I'm gonna miss this. I've got to go to the bathroom. You can see God's hand on their little faces. You can not tell me angels do not exist. Can I get an "Amen" Amen! there are angels. I'm fed up with this crap! Do you hear me? You really pissed me off. Not so loud Look at me. Am I, or am I not, a bestselling author? I write the books don't I? Answer me! Look. As your manager, I have to say, a lecture is a lecture. Have you seen this place? I'm Jeff Noffray. I'm not one of your crummy beginners I've been a major reference for thirty years! You told me this would be a nice venue. Look around, we're in a rathole. They're your readers! My readers are white. They come to hear me in five star hotels. - Have you seen this crowd? - Calm down. A bunch of Black and Mexican retards. Who knows what diseases we're catching, exposed to these third world losers dumb enough to think angels exist! - Help! - What are you doing? Let him go! You need to know what he said about you! Hey man. Just let the man go, please! Help! What are you doing? What's going on? Help! - Joey? No! - So you really think I'm a retard huh? Joey, let him go! - You're a liar! - Stop! - We came from Kansas City to see you! - The guy's crazy. - and you're a racist, and you're a liar! - Hey get back in here! Look. Look at them. I can't see anything. Right there. There is nothing there, Joey. Or maybe there is, but... I don't want to think things exist that I can't see. It's not encouraging. It's depressing. They're there. They all are. But if you're the only that can see them... You can't share them, And if you can't share them... they'll miss the point? You don't need angels or ghosts or magic... the sharing is what's extraordinary. Let's just... share the moon Now boarding Amtrac train number 345, for Baton Rouge, on track two. I'm starving. Uh, there is a vending machine back there. I can go get you something. - We don't have time. - Just a second. I'll be back. Where is it? Hello? Hello? I'm a... I'm at a train station. Are you okay? I know. I know. I never thought that. No. Okay, I'll do it. Okay. Yes Wait, don't hang up! Say something... to me. It's him. Plain or peanuts? What... what happened? Her husband's back. He called me just like that, on a train station platform. I'm ready to go. - You have everything? - Got your wish. Now you gotta go to him. You better go. I don't know what to say. You want plain, or you want peanuts? Plain. Thanks... for everything. Take care of yourself, okay? I have half the Moon! I'm still looking at this tree, through the window. What I see through the window is real. I guess someone is alone as they think. I... am... walking. angels and magic aren't important, Jane. Yet you have to share what actually exists. Is that what you say, Joey? Somebody whispered that in my ear. Maybe we'll see her again sometime. We all do what we can to feel a little of this wind on our skin. A breath, pushing in the warmth, that makes the journey sweeter. How many people can you meet in one life? How many trains must you take, before you find yourself again? I don't know if I believe in God. Why would I believe in anything other than myself? Why would I believe in anthing other than my neighbor? Mama, will I ever walk again? I... am... walking. I am walking. I am walking. I am walking...! Devon! Devon, come over here honey. Devon, come see. Your Uncle Joseph has something for you. - Tell him to come over here. - It's not important, let him play. Devon! Devon. Want another gift? - I'm coming. - I knew that would get his attention. - What is it? - No no, you shouldn't ask what it is. Let him be. I was given this pen at my own communion, long time ago. I've had my initials changed. See? It has your initial now. It is only for writing important things. That's very lovely. Take good care of it. Yes - Will you hold it for me please? - Sure. Hey Devon, stay close, we're leaving in five minutes. Are you waiting for someone? No. You know if letters sometimes get lost in the mail? I have no idea. Let's go, Devon. Hey.. here's the big man! Alright, say thank you to grandpa for organizing everything. - Thank you Grandpa. - What a good boy. Say goodbye to everyone. - Thank you so much. - My pleasure. - We'll talk to you later. - Bye. Can you see him? There's a dozen kids in there. dark blond hair. Let's just go inside. I don't know if I can, Joey. Yes you can, because you're invited. I want to leave. There is a platform... and it's got a piano on it. So? So, we'll just go in, and play your song. No, this isn't the right time. That would feel right at all. - It would be a great surprise. - Are we coming back later? No, honey. We're sleeping over at Aunt Nancy's. Say goodbye to Mimi? No. It was wonderful. You know, I cried all though the ceremony. I cried too. You know he's a man now. I know. Alright honey, go get in the car. I'll be there in a sec. - I'm not letting you leave, Jane. - It's not up to you. What are you doing? I can't even tell which one is Devon. Go in. Sing. He'll know who you are. I'm scared The evening wind are still I lost the way and will Can't tell you where they went I just know what they meant I'm always on my guard Admitting life is hard without you near me - Devon! - The friend you used to be So near and dear to me You slipped so far away Where did we go a-stray I forgot my hat. Devon, Nancy's waiting on us. ...admitting life is hard Without you near me Ever since the day... ...the day went away... When I felt that emptiness so wide I don't know what's wrong or right But I know I need strength to fight Strength to fight that world outside Since we've been out of touch I haven't felt that much From day to barren day My heart stays locked away I walk the boulevard Admitting life is hard without you near me The sun is sinking low I guess it's time to go I feel a chilly breeze In place of memories My dreams are locked and barred Admitting life is hard without you near me without you near me You hear about that monster that lives on a lake in Scotland? Why? You seeing stuff again? - No. Are you? - No. We're in Kansas. There aren't monsters in lakes. Just tornadoes and, yellow brick roads. Can you.. uh.. give me a lift back to the hospital on the way back? I gotta get my final evaluation today. The therapist says I can... I can live on my own again. You know what's scary is... you're the most stable person I know. I think they're late. - Are you nervous? - No. Cause I did catch you tapping your foot earlier. Real funny. I think that... they're here. It's gonna be alright.
