Like in a mirror.. or leaning on the windowsill facing the street.. passes in front from our eyes any sunday of which we live. A Sunday like another in which we try forget bad thoughts. The pain, the injustice, war, poverty, that six days of the week.. they are like sentinels on the sidewalks. This story takes place in Rome. The distant Rome of the relationships with people and day-to-day things. Rome like Paris, like London. like New York, like Moscow. A city like any other.. united around to a sports flag.. that has a name entrusted to eleven men. Our world, for two hours, closes between the stands.. of a stadium, side by side with dozens of thousands of strangers.. sick with the same fever. Of our own weaknesses and passions. But not all passions are born and die.. in those two hours. This is the story we tell you. Little human facts seen and lived daily.. that they end up covering of your poetry and our journey. You and us, then, since dawn until sundown on a Sunday. Thirty "Avanti" and forty "Unità"! - Thank you. - Do you give me "Grand'Hotel"? - You want it? - Yes, do you mind. - Carlo, two hundred from the "Messaggero". See you at one. - Yes See you later.

How many good things will they bring you from the field!! When we invite them we want to say "thank you" for all they bring. Ding Dong! Ding Dong! Wake up daughters, get up at once the script is not ready. Mr Lee is coming in person to pick it up. If the work is not done, We won't get paid for it! Why all the filmmakers are they so rare? - Marisa, come on! - Dad, how much you chatter! Marisa, go... Raimondo called. - What did you say? - Finally, you've gotten up! - It's not true. - Get up, there is work awaiting for you! Come on. At your age I...

The coffee! - Good. - It's very good. - Goodness. - Marcella, the coffee. - And nothing for me? - How many cups are you going to drink? - I've only had a tiny cup. Don't drink it all, it will make you nervous. Hey you, just who is the head of this house? What are you laughing at, stupid? Quiet! Are we all here? Yes. Let's go. The "ciuccio" arrives in the truck.. and we all have to be here to receive it. - Come on let's go. - Wait a minute. "Ave Roma". We salute the capital! Tarado. Forza Naples.

No, no, don't worry. < Everything is just fine. Mom and Dad we all have such good memories. < I have brought a basket of eggs. < That's why I am shouting. There are people waiting for the phone. That's it. Excuse me. Let's go. - Hello? - Hello, Calamatta pension? Attorney Conti, please. - Who? - Attorney Conti, please. Attorney Conti is not here. Who's calling? May I? I would like to be on a cloud with you. Where the sky looks like a table. And you don't slip. And happiness is a fairy tale. Fly, heart, fly. Sandra! Sandra! Have you gone deaf? What's up dad? Don't you think I sing better than those on the radio? Not even on Sunday can one get some sleep! The other days what do you do in the office? Sleep! Ooph! Gigetto, wake up. Wake up, Gigetto!

It's nine-thirty already. Sunday in bed as if the rest of the week you actually work. Is Dad sleeping? - You have to wait for him to give you permission .. after the night shift? - And then how do I do it? - How do you do what? I have no money for the game, my friends will come looking for me. If you are not going. Are you standing and you think of the game? Naples plays today. For us Romanistas this is an obligation. Sunday's game is a way not to forget about all our daily problems. - Dad understands. - You get it! You old fool! So you like Tifosi. All Lazio and Togliatti. What do you do? I have already looked, there is nothing. I remember when your father tiptoed in... twenty years ago to put your candies under the cushion .. while you were sleeping. - Where you going now? Don't wake him up. - Who wakes him up? - I'll take the shirt on Sundays. - Go slow huh? - Good. Papá. Now you whistle? Soon the three of us will whistle instead of eating .. if you find no work. - You know what I'm saying? I will find work. - They call you - What shall I tell them? - The truth. Are you ashamed? Uff! Eh! Finally, you have come out! - Are we leaving at noon? - Yes, if not the train ride .. we have to tie it to the car. - I'm not going. - Are you crazy? No, I can not. I understand you have to go with her. What a grace! If you had a girl like her... - Plant it. I'm not going because I have no money. At one in the terminal. See you this afternoon, I go through the billiards. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning dudes. Then we go. Hello. Go Rome! Yes, yes, go Rome! Hey. - Have you bathed? - What about you, do not you bathe? Today it's daddy's turn. Can you get out? - A while. I have to help mom. - At ten. - Where ever. - Okay. - Sandra? - What? You... you look very pretty. Mrs. Pieri, what does your husband think of today's game? I'm afraid he will suffer a lot for his Rome. - Surely if he were still in the goal position... - Can I have five chips? Five chips? Shall I put them on the account? But you must wait. The elevator just went up now. The world is made of stairs. There are those who go down and those who go up. How is it not? He told me to call him at this time. < Yes yes at this time. Okay. Please take note. It is important Bruno Pieri. Phone number 873414. Have you noted it correctly? Thank you. Excuse me. Dad, do you like it? - Dad? - Yes, Yes. I like it. - But you're not listening to me. - I hear you, I hear you. Keep going. Do you think I hadn't heard you? And you as if I were not there! I can not anymore. I'm already tired just starting the day. - Go to the market Sunday morning... Frankly, Bruno I... - I know. But at the beginning of the month we will have a maid again. - Have you talked to Monzeglio? - Yes right now. I was at the hotel. - And what did he say? - Everything is fine. When I come to Rome we will be safe. They are looking for a coach for Naplés reserves. - Well, go and find him at the stadium. - Yes, but what are you afraid of? You are unfair. This time it is I who has to humble himself, to beg. Do you call this "humiliation"? After all what have you given to the sport? Your future! They got you a job of 50,000 pounds! María! Do we have to starve? And to think that we got married by car. < Photographs in newspapers. Paris, Nice in summer. - Shall I stop playing, mom? - Yes. Anyway, you will never get your diploma. Maria! - You bought me the "Corrierino"? Yes. Here. Here you go, the first fifty lire. The news stand has told me that talk about you. There is an article on past glories. - "Old glories!" - Enough. I could become a coach you know. I have rejected many offers because of you. Yes, C Series equipment deals! Was I going to leave Rome for a provincial town? - These were not our dreams. - This is the reality. Enough. I repeat that enough. Naples is not a provincial town. What if Naples loses today, Do you care about the position? Would you be willing to resign the position for your Rome to win today? I forgot the bread. - Up and down again. - Do you want me to go? And then the girl tells him... "Commander, you will be lucky in love, .. but in the game you will have very bad luck!" No, I will not allow it. - I beg you, leave me. - Miss.. do you want to leave or should I call the director? Have you finally been convinced? The lawyer Conti is not here, he is out of Rome. I've told you before on the phone. Or do you want to search the room? - What manners! - Stop. - Stop it? - Listen, I... - He's out of Rome. - I have to talk to him. It is very important. I am not leaving Rome without seeing him first. I will call later. < Agree. < And now, do you want to leave now? - Thank you. - Shall we continue? - No see you tomorrow. - Alright. - Wait a minute. Hello? Hello, "cicci". You were still sleeping? Sorry. I just wanted to tell you that you better postpone the date until after the game. At Rosati in the Piazza del Popolo. Yes, it is the adventure of Salerno that returns to the charge. You'll make me jealous, Bob. Women are just toys in your hands. Yes, yes, in Rosati. Goodbye. - I'm here. - Hi. - Hi. Why are you looking at me? Is there something wrong? - Have you changed your hairstyle? - No. You always find me different. If you don't like me anymore... Very good, today will be a beautiful Sunday. One thousand lire, minus ten cigarettes. Let's go to the match and then we escape to the movies. - No party. - Are you crazy? I can't go. Montefiascone's relatives are coming. - They can go to hell. - I have given my word. They are people in high positions, we must treat them well. - Why do you care? - And you talk like that? Because I what? Take a look for a moment! - Listen to me. - We started off poorly. - We started very well. Uncle Clemente has bought another van. You know what that means? You'll need another driver. - If he likes you... - Me? - Yes, you. - You shouldn't go to the game. - I'm meeting friends. What would I do in the stadium without my friends? Half of the fun is gone, everything is different. - Ah, so you weren't going to go with me then? - We were all going to go together. I told you not to go. Look, at around three o clock, come to my house. Very quietly, please. This is my Uncle Clemente. And you might just find the job you were looking for. - And the game? - Do we have to discuss it today? Do I have to remind you what can happen if you find a job? - Brunette, get married. - Damn, son of a... Can you walk me home? Then we can go to the movies. In the Preneste they are playing an old but nice movie. "The Dynasty of the Forsyte". Starring Greer Garson, Errol Flynn and Walter Pidgeon. - Do you like Greer Garson? - Yes, she's a good actress. Ah, put on the nice tie, that one with the dogs that I have given you. - Uncle Clemente takes that into account. - Couldn't we do one thing? - No. - I put on my tie. - You need to go home. - And try to be nice. - You always do what you want. Can I remove the tray? Can I have another coffee, please? Leave that. Sorry. Precisely because it was his job, yes not on sunday... Ah, I appreciate it. Unfortunately it was urgent. But if you want to return this late... - No, please. He meant to say. Even my daughters They can't wait to leave. Because on Sunday afternoon one goes to the cinema to dream. And the other goes out with the boyfriend. Ah. That will be the boyfriend, right? Lucky. Dad, we're almost done. - I only have six folders. - And me five. Don't waste your time, work. So he's going to the game, huh? Maybe you think of a movie about soccer? - No. Last year we succeeded with a script... Who was the director with which we won .. with the script about soccer? - Hey? - He always wore his boots. - Dad, are you rushing us? Daos Prisa. I go for the show. - And you, are you going to the game? - Me? No. I never go. I'm interested because I do pools. I fill in the tickets, but I don't understand anything. Isn't it true?? - Have you ever won? - Never. He once won. How much did you win? - 9,000 liras. - Ah well... Don't be discouraged. Just people like you when you win... < ..earn millions. Oh my god! What would I do with millions? I swear on the heads of my daughters. - I would not know what to do? - No. What I hope today like manna from heaven .. it's 300,000 lire. I'm 50 years old, I have a pension of the Ministry. I have worked 30 years in Public Education. I've seen it all. From Benedetto Croce... Do you know who it is? Until Bottai who was who retired me. In short, that with 300,000 lire, maximum half a million, .. this one ends my college studies and getting married. - This other finds a husband. - If I want I can find it myself. Yes, yes, good. I buy two new machines, I hire two typists. And who is happier than me and my old age? With the millions the bitterness would begin. These would go up to the head. - Hopefully! - It wouldn't happen to me. - You don't know what life is. And with everything that says how is it possible that never seen a game. No I'm not one of these fools that stick to the radio .. to hear the results. My departure on Sundays in the afternoon it is to petanque. At the Pallacio del Ponte Milvio. Why don't you come? I could give ideas. There is wine! - Why not? Is this for me? - No, it's for Raimondo. - Thank you. - Thanks Mom. - Doctor, we are almost done. - Thank you. Will you remember to bring us the photo of the Bergman dedicated he promised us? Here is the youth of today. He football, Bergman, Rossellini. Father! - Even we copy typed scripts, .. here you live with cinema. - And hopefully with football. Ah, 300,000 lire. Half a million tops. Not a penny more, I swear on their heads. Father! - What did I say wrong? There is a Freudian complex. Football as a show is an end in itself. It is harmful. It's a show of a given area. - If they look for me, I'm not here, they haven't seen me. - Fine, I understand. - Come. - What's happening? - I'm looking for lawyer Conti. - I have not seen him. - But his car is outside. - And what do you want me to tell you? He always comes here, but I haven't seen him today. - Can I have a token, please? - Sell lire. She might have seen me, she must have seen me in the car. And now what do I do? If I had only known before what the widow was like... Give me the keys. - What do you intend to do? - Give me the car keys, I tell you! Diga. Diga! - Excuse me, is this lawyer Conti's car? - Yes, why? - I need to talk to him, it's urgent. Where is he? - He is gone.. with a car of friends and he has left me the car. You may see him in the game, he always goes. Yes, at the game. You should also go to the stadium. - To the stadium? Yes, on the platform. Now excuse me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Mass today. We said it quick, very quick, huh, reverend? They are your imaginations. - Play Naples, we are on the game. - You always want to joke. - I do not understand where you see the point? Go light the candles. Maurizio! - It's the mambo, Father. - I'm going to give you mambo! If Naples wins today Will you fire the firecrackers? Go Rome! Madonna, help me! Shortly after noon the city seems almost deserted. It's like taking a breath. Soon an anxious and noisy crowd will take to the street. Please, five minutes earlier. You can't. - Do a work charity. - Outside! - What team are you from? - What? Three hundred lire the hunchback, the mascot of your favorite team. Buy the hunchback. The insignia of Rome. fifty lire. I would not pay even five lire. Three hundred lire for the hunchback. - Are you Neapolitan? - Do you mind? - And you sell these things? - They are made in Naples. - Ah, said it before. - I salute you, countryman. Three hundred lire for the hunchback. - Here's your orange juice. - Doll! - Doll, put the lemon down. - Okay. - Let's hurry up. - Drinks! - Get the knots right. - How are the ticket sales going? - Good. - Please, let's keep it high. "Ciucciariello" my preciousness think! Like what who is it? It speaks for itself! - Who does he represent? - This is the God of gatekeepers. - Who is it, Saint Peter? - It's Casari, from Napoli! Do we open? Let's open. Raise the banners. Wait, be quiet. Hush, guys. Damn! Let's keep the heart and soul like this. Enough, let's think about serious things. Boys, stand up! Chorus. First group. Oh, oh, oh! High. Second group. ¡Alto! We win and we go. The squad has arrived in Rome. We beat him up. It is the same for us. All teams celebrate it. - Let's go. - Another glass? - No thanks. We wait for Mr. Ezio and if we mix too much it will hurt us. Are you going to see your Rome? - What? What a degenerate son I have! He's a Romanist! Yes, but you are going to second. You'll see what a beating. Do not be angry, No one will go to second. And you, wife, go out? Can I be calm... or must I be jealous? - It would be time, .. on Sundays you always leave. - Not always. Two Sundays yes and one no. That is the deal. And you don't go out? - No, I'm not going out. - Madam, my respects. - Goodbye. - Excuse us if we take an Amleto. I was joking, have a good time. This can not wait when I leave. Do you dislike not going to the match? I mean that money I can give it to you. Thank you, but I got it. Dad gave it to me. Ah, you can go... - But I'm not going anyway. - Why? - Because I don't feel like it anymore. Let's go for a ride... with Pietro's car. Are you coming? What happened to you? We waited an hour at the train stop for you. Let him be, and I know mother. I'm not going to the game. Not coming? - Do you always have to be with her? - Imagine when you get married. - Say hi to your little wife. Make fun of it, but you were right behind from Sandra before she was promised! - Me? - Don't worry, the game will tell you... I will tell you... Yes, for you we would need an extension. - Let's go. - Goodbye, Giulio. Here are the tagliatelle. - First the children. - No. First to Uncle Clemente. And Aunt Gemma. - And grandpa. How many attentions today. What happens? Nothing. I bet you liked it the news of the new van. - What color is it? - What color is it? Green. And what difference does color make? What counts is the engine. Baby what do you want? To take a walk? And how is Senorito Giulio? Are you still unemployed? Listen to me uncle... - Don't listen, bring me this young man. Bring him to me right away I want to put him in a gang. Do you have a driver's license or have you rented it too? - Of course, if he was driving the General's car. - From the Captain. - What do you know? Why do you get in? - He told me to. - Father! - It's okay, bring it to me. Let's see if we can put it somewhere. All can be. - Eat, eat. - No, I'm already stuffed. - No, eat. Health is everything. - Yes, let's see if I burst. "Let's see if you burst." I would like to see where it would all go... your silly comments over a such a tragedy. - Look, you're going to run out of tagliatelle. - No, there is plenty left. - Faustino. - Just a little bit. - I'm not hungry. - But think about eating. This boy worries me. He goes to the movies far too often. Notice that the other afternoon I saw him with that shameless... Elvira... But I'll tell you later, when there are no innocent ears nearby. - What about us? - Do not worry. Who understands that? Did you like the wine? It seems to me that the sauce turned out very bland. No, no, it's okay. - Be careful with the wine, eh? - It's my first. - Your first? Do you think that I haven't been watching you? He's a bit of an alcoholic. Do you know what his friends call him? "The foggy lawyer". - I never talk. - No, but you always see the fog. Blessed are you, who can see things clearly even if you are a bit confused. Hey, get that vase off your head Before it falls off and you eat it by accident. - How dare you? - Ah, yes "How dare you"? Idiot! The saint has spoken! - This is really good. - Give it to me, aunt. Did you like the tagliatelle? - Very good. - Want more? - No, no, no. - Did you like it? - But yes, remember that I married you for your cooking! My husband is the king of kindness. - Sandra, come eat. - Yes, here I come. When someone falls in love do they always become so silly? Women do, but we don't. Wow, see how modern these kids are! Let's have a toast! - Chew slowly. - Take out the coffee, there is none left.. Yes, Yes. I'll take it out. Hey Maria, I was thinking, why don't you come to the stadium too? - Are you coming? - How much does it cost, 800 or 1000? My cost as a partner is 500. Your cost is 800. Come on, let's go. No. This month's check on the 27th is further away than ever. Dad I don't remember ever seeing you play. Was it only for a short time? And just who is this pretty girl in that photo wearing her father's goalkeeper gloves? - Isn't that Renata with her father? - Well, I don't recognize myself. - Now you are much older, you have grown. - Well, you're always the same. Doesn't he always seem the same? Actually no, it is just old glories. - So you're not coming to the game? - No. - Is it being broadcast on the radio? - I think so. Well then, you better not listen to the radio. If Naples loses... Then we meet at 17:45. We will go to the movies. Goodbye, Renata. - María. - Bye. Maria, we must have hope. I'm very tired of hope. Mom, what does "old glory" mean? - Excuse me, is this going to the stadium? - No, to Capannelle. - And to go to the stadium? - Good afternoon. - Are you also going to the stadium, miss? This one goes there. - Thank you. You may not know to get there, Shall I accompany you? What airs! Who does she think she is? Lello, have a look. - Don't beep. - So it's from Lazio. - Yes, why? - Let's go. Can we go please? We are late for the match. Let's go, it's good. What? Go Lazio! - It's okay. Go Rome! - Hey, slow down. - Run, run! And now comes the most indescribable moment of the sports day. Once they have eaten quickly and wrecklessly. the crowd approaches to the stadium. The stadium takes hold of the crowd that grows louder while waiting for the match to begin. Bring your own naivety and excitement. Their arguing and discussions so well debated. And their bitterness, .. that can easily be confused and mixed in with all the collective clamor. Haven't you been able to get money in a week's time? If I asked my dad for a lyre my mother would kill me. - How stingy! - My father is unemployed. - Let's do the trick and enter. - Speak Low. Turn a ticket and we make him rip it on the other side. When we are inside we pass it back to you inside a handkerchief. Sorry - Calm down. Do you want to stop? - Pieri. - Hi. - I would like to see you in the goal position like before. - Today would be your big day. - Forget it already. Just old memories. - Reverend, who do you pray for? - I'm from Napoli. Saint Gennaro the Just. Do they come for the match or come to hunt for love? I love to dance at the Home of the Soldier. - Come on, let's go. - Quiet. - What are you doing, are you coming with us? - No, I prefer soccer. What an idiot! Come on, charge. - Good morning ladies. - Nice day. - Leave me alone. - Do me a favor. I'm going to tell these infantrymen! Excuse me! Warriors, queue up! - I don't have fun at matches. - Well, I do. - This is the last time. - Okay, fine this will be the last time. - Whoops, sorry, Excuse me. - Please, can you tell me where the grandstand is? - Have you ever been to the stadium before? - No. Leave it to me. I will help you get in. Didn't you say you wanted to come in? - Yes, but... - I'll take care of the ticket purchase, just provide money for the tickets. Thank you. - Giulio? - Giulio? Where has he gone? I heard the whistle. Where is he? Giulio? - How much are two for the grandstand? - 1,500. Does She not know how to read? - Giulio? - Mira. Maldito! - Look! There he is, with that blonde! - I'll tell Sandra! - And just who is that lady? - Let's go see. Don't worry, come with me. I can show you the way I always go to the rostrum. - You are very kind and helpful. - Please. Come on. - If you will not be standing the whole game. - Doctor. Good Morning. Good morning, doctor, excuse me. My respects, miss. Good Morning. - My respects! - Goodbye, doctor. Good Morning. Good Morning, miss. - Good Morning. They are joking. They are old friends from college. They always joke. Come on, miss. "Ma'am." Cars. Cars. Cars. From the luxurious out of the box, to the hard-earned Topolino. And countless motorcycles and bicycles. Gathered, from anywhere in the city. There is no fear of theft. Even thieves, if any .. forget the profession".. because of the sports fever. Listen to these kids! What things! And look at this. Wake up! - Eh? Stole! - But what do you steal! We are playing broomstick! Do you have to be on top of me? Get out of here! These children are demons. Go to the patio to play! Get off my feet! Voucher. - How's the game going? Who is winning? - Then I'll bring you the coffee. - Yes, it is urgent, this one is sleeping. - Do you want me to help you? - No, don't bother. I will do it all. Where is that phenomenon... as a driver, that handyman, that encyclopedic man? - What are we doing here? - Then it's my turn. - Here's the coffee. - Goodness. - I have prepared it very strong. - For this we would need... chili extract! - Is Sandra gone? Yes, but come back soon. - These beans are not cooked. - Faustino. - Thank you Aunt. What a rush! I'm coming, I'm coming. Excuse me, Mrs. Gisella. - Giulio? - It is not. - Isn't it? - No. She went to buy tobacco. - It is not true! - How is it not true? Do I tell lies? For him yes, because he loves him very much. However, he does not deserve anything. - He's stupid, that's what he is! - Come here. Do we have to talk at the door so that everyone finds out? Let's go. Make me lose... such an occasion... - What occasion? - How!...Giulio has not told him that he had to come to my house to meet Uncle Clemente?, .. Montefiascone's would have gotten him a job. - Wretched! And has he gone to the game? - To the match? - This one owes me. I will make you pay dearly for this! - I was.. wasting away. So I told him to go, .. swear I did not know anything! -Sandra! - This one is not able to return until the evening out of shame. And I have to make him talk to the guy to solve it, to avoid ruining everything! - And what are you going to do? - What am I going to do? I'm going to grap him by the neck and bring him here! - Hey! - Huh? Excuse me, .. but Giulio has behaved with you like an only child. With me, if I am to marry him, he has to do what I say! What if he doesn't want to? What do you think? With the new shoes, huh? If mom sees you... Go ahead, what do you want? Go there, I'll give you 200 lire. Tell him to entertain .. to Uncle Clemente until I arrive with Giulio. Got it? - I throw! - I can't, can't you see I'm a doorman? - Go away! I wear myself. Hey, the goals you score with her not worth it, huh? And who shoots? - And to think that there is your widow in the middle. - Enough. It's hot, huh? Can I help you? You want me to call for drinks? - Excuse me? - As I see her look... Has someone been lost? How is she dressed? - Is it a man or a woman? - I had been told on the platform. They played a joke on him. In the middle of this madness, and besides with the game started... - But how long is the game? - Tell the truth. He has never seen a game. Look at that "wimp"! Neapolitans, what an ass of a midfielder you have! At least he knows how to kick! - Let's see if you unburden yourself! - Well said! - San Gennaro, help us... - Go, Naples! Naples! Naples! Naples! Rome! Rome! Rome! Naples! Naples! Naples! Rome! Rome! Rome! Have you seen all of the goals we have scored against them? Ma'am, are you ill? Am I going to catch anything from you? Can I make you a paper hat? "You with the drinks"! "Boy", come here! What a bad call! Sundqvist was off-side. Reverend, don't embarass your uniform .. But if it was offside! Why can't you tell? Don Camillo has arrived! One hundred lire. - Here. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Don't mention it. Madam, in your condition you should not have come to the match. - And who asked you? - Are you her husband? But what a husband! We were about to score again, but the defense of Naples .. has called Galli and the referee has not whistled the foul! Son of a bitch! Who? Ah! Now a foul in our favour. - Bortoletto is wearing it. - Boy, what are you doing? From Carosio? Bah, I train. What did they do? What's happening? The lleva Bortoletto, if it passes to Galli, Galli to Bronée... Gooooaaal! The Rome attack is proving particularly brilliant. In the first half .. he has already scored two goals, at 30 'Sundqvist and at 45' Bronée. Now Naples attacks. Palla to Gramaglia. Towards Amadei. Carletto! Carletto! Asómate! - We have marked? - Be careful not to explode. Carletto! < Carletto! Poor lady, they left you all alone, eh? Do you want me to give you a ride? They do it even on horseback... < Carletto! Do you really know Salerno? I've actually told a lie. I only know that Salernitanta plays second. - But you're not from Salerno. - No. My husband. But it's not an ugly city, you know. The sea is beautiful. True, it is a bit provincial, a bit on the fringes of life. - Sure, yes. - But you get used to it. You get used to everything. - What an idiot! - Why has the game stopped? Because Galli was offside. Look, when... - Are we going back to kindergarten? - You have never been to a match, have you? - Looking for a fight? - Stop or I'll leave. - I'm asking you. - Oh! Thank goodness. - Why? - I wanted to say, thank goodness .. that I finally saw you smile sincerely. "Thank you for your kindness," but we will score the others! We scored one! We scored one! - Reverend was at his own goal door. - Bah? If we start with miracles... - Will they tie us? - No, Rome is playing well. And why that face? You? I do not understand. You don't like it. Let it be. Cuckold referee! You are bought and paid for! So, you don't regret staying for the game? On the contrary. I feel bad for you. I have not let you enjoy the great day of his Rome in peace. Oh, you know... My Rome... You get carried away by enthusiasm but then there is nothing .. sadder than coming back from the game. But today for me it was something else. I will not remember this Sunday because Rome won. But because I met you. Jeppsen's magnificent goal has not cut... the insurmountable distance that separates Naples from Rome. And at this moment the referee has whistled the end of the game. Final score, Rome 5, Naples 2. - Tell me, how did you get this donkey? - Get what? Take home all five goals! We are going to take "ciuccio" to the freight train. What? On a freight train! I would send him on foot to Naples. This stinky "ciuccio". - Are we looking for Giulio? - No, he's in good company. - And Sandra? - But you weren't friends! Enough already, Giulio will come to the biliary. - Here, refresh yourself. - I have no money. There he is. Let's go guys! - Nino, what have you missed! - Rome wins and you cry? Let's play a game with the new ball. I give it to you. I do not care about the new ball. - How much is it, 100 or 200 lire? - Have you seen! - Beautiful! - Capullo! - Are you still looking for that person? - Yes. Now it's better to say goodbye. If you told him to meet you on the rostrum, he probly didn't want you to find him. Excuse me. I am behaving like a jerk. No, Giulio, quite the opposite, but that man in the car. If I recognize him and... - Everyone is leaving the parking lots. I can accompany you to the Piazza del Popolo. Almost everyone goes through there. And there is also a very nice cafe. - Will it bother you if I tell you something? - No. I would like to say goodbye in another way, but not here, in the midst of the people. It's okay, Giulio. Let's go to that cafe. Reverend, do we ring the bells for the dead? Ding-dong-dong! Ding-dong-dong! We have surrounded it, oh, oh, oh! Les hemos rubberized, Oh oh oh! - Giulio! Giulio! - What is it? Giulio! Giulio! - Good morning, Colonel. - Pieri, bye. - And Monzeglio? - Monzeglio? - When am I going to Naples? - To Naples? Does the reserve team need a coach? If we bring the issue to the Council after the defeat... today, it won't do any good. - But I was counting on that. Better postpone it. Let's not talk more here. Cheer up, huh? Goodbye. Good Morning. - But if this is Pieri! Yes, it is Pieri! Long live Pieri! - Thank you. When will Roma have a goalkeeper like him again? Hate, happiness... I know very well that it is a cliché. He had said "happiness" just like that, figuratively speaking. I was happy. With my husband. An accident with the bus. All wounded and only he... We had barely been married a year. - We had been together at the University. - Sorry I do not... Please no, you have been very kind to me. I will remember more than what... he thinks about his words and how he has done me... take an interest in the game. Maybe that was what he wanted, .. to get out of my lethargy and be able to speak out loud. - When you no longer have faith in life... - But if you are young, .. fine, educated, to be raffled off for life. What could I have taught you? Let's be serious. I simply wish that we were friends. Yes, my love and my girl. I'm dating a girl. Look, her name is Sandra, maybe she was not very favored... - But what does she say, if she is very pretty! - Hey! She has a type. If I showed up here I'd gouge my eyes out. - She is jealous? - She says that when we get married it will pass. Really, if you don't mind, Sandra and I will wait for you. And now you will see Rome for real. She is pretty, you know? Like her soccer team. And we, forgive me, we will not behave like these Roman friends of yours, .. who have not bothered to greet you, knowing that you were arriving. Wait, hide. Run to the car, I already paid. Señora... Go away, I beg you. Go away. But you are not well. I can accompany you. Where would you like to go? Do you want to win? Come on, get the point! - Come on, shoot! - Wait a minute. Pay attention, ok? One... Two... Three... Here I go! - Damn, I gave them the point. - And the game. Do you bring bad luck, accountant? - Me? - Yes, you. - Who knows? - Oh well! - Shall we play another? - No, stop, let's drink. - And we pay. I think so! In Bergamo, Atalanta beat Pro-Patria 3-2. - Who could think? In Bologna, Udinese .. beat Bologna 3 to 1. - What had he asked for? - That week! Millions! - Yes, beh... Fiorentina and Lazio, 0 to 0. - This one. - You, sparkling water? - No. Wine. Yes, he won. Already going well. - Millions! Millions! - But where is he running? - Millions! - Moron! - Millions! - Do you have the results? - They just said it on the radio. - But are they accurate? Wait and tell me. I want to see them. "1-X-1-2-1 Slowly!" Don't run, I haven't understood anything. Repeat. < "1-X-1." These three I have. "1-X-1", here they are. "2-X-1 - "2-X-1"? - You're deaf? She told you! "2-X-1"! 35/5000 - I have all six. - Come on, continue! Look... No, not you, accountant, be patient. - I follow? - Yes! - "2-2-X". - Oh my God! - What's happening? - I've been nine out of nine! - And Seregno? Where is Seregno? - It must be in Sicily. No! I mean, what has Seregno done? X .. - Ten! Ten! You are going to see how the 300,000 lire escapes me! Messina-Catania, the radio has announced another draw. Eleven! I have eleven! Totò, and if by chance you have won a few million? No, no, with eleven I have not won anything for now. And also for me, half a million is enough, the rest I give it to you. He wants ten thousand lire for this pool? - Poor "cocco"! - Ten thousand lire? You give me 300,000 lire and I will give it to you quickly. - Don't be crazy. - All still! Pay the millionaire! Millions or not, the other results I want to hear at home... with my ears. - I'll accompany you, you never know. I'm going too. - Let's all go then. Can I go? Accountant, do not take it the wrong way, superstition is better than not! I get it. Just in case I'll come by later to congratulate you. - Just in case, huh? - I call a taxi. But then remember? Do not start asking! Walk! We sung triple line, huh? In fact, it has been "five". - Fortune with a capital F. - Good afternoon, Vincenzo. - The lady has left. - When? It will be about half an hour. Five goals. Five goals! - What a beating... - You haven't left a message for me? Nothing. The lady wore a grim face like his. - Let's see, has Rome won? Good. But when... - Thank you. Do we lose and this one cries? This is crazy! The weak point of this team, we all know, is their offense. The draw result at home has confirmed what we have said. Concluding the overview on all the fields in which... matches have been played First Division, .. we find that Moro, Sampdoria goalkeeper, has played .. the best game of his career. A performance .. exceptional that places him at the top of the best goalkeepers... not only Italians, but also Europeans, of all time, from Zamora, .. in De Prà, from Planichka to Pieri. We have transmitted: "Sport News". And now a symphonic music program. < Papá! Father! Come with us! In Livorno, Livorno-Alessandria 3 to 3. Candy! Candy! Silence! Silence! In Lodi, Fanfulla .. Genoa 1 to 1. - Thirteen! Luck has smiled on us because we have never done it wrong. to nobody! - You have done better than anyone. - Rich wife overnight. - What do you want me to do? - And what would he know, poor thing? Father! - Marisa! Silence! Silence! This is the millionaire speaking! Let's put a newspaper on the table so it doesn't get dirty. You buy all the furniture again! How many do you think there will be? Let's see, to begin with, the "machine". - Not the typewriter, a real one! - An Alfa Romeo! - Then a house. A house. - A house, huh! No, actually, I don't want a house. I want a villa! - A large villa with a garden. - Yes, with a garden. But I'll keep working. Yes. I won't be able to quit. Do you know what I'm going to do? I'll set up an equestrian circus. With lions. And a large international transportation company. With northern horses, okay? But first you and I will have a nice trip. Just you and I. - We will go to London, to Paris. - To America! - Yes, to America! No, not to America, there is the ocean. And then I want to see Lake Balaton. - I want to see Lake Balaton! - Antonio! But if it is in Russia! Well... < May I? - Dear Valli! - You can? - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Come in. Give me your hand. Congratulations from all my heart. - Thank you. - It is not true that it brings bad luck. - There isn't any thirteen. - Precisely... What? - No one has 13... - What are you saying? But please! No, no, no. No, no, no. I've been watching the pool results closely. These are the official results. Take a good look. "In Rome no one has thirteen." But I got thirteen, right? Here it is! What does this paper matter to me? - No no no! - Why not? - Because you only have twelve. - Twelve? - And it's close to four million. - Four million? - That's it. - But what is four million these days? What am I going to do? - But is he crazy? - Four million, what is that? But he has always said that he wanted to win 300,000 lire! How is that 300,000 lire? I had won! I feel bad. Get everyone out of here. Just leave me alone! Four million! I don't want it, that's it! - Totò, you'll manage. - Four million is still four million. Let it be. Leave him alone for a while. Everybody leave now! - Bad luck, huh? - Four million! What is that worth? Nothing! I'll stay as I am. - Medium poor. - But how can you say that? Four million! - Hello Sandra. - Good afternoon. Wake up! Father. - What happened? - It's day, but in reality, it's night. - Wait two minutes. - No, no, not at all. - Say something. - But what do you want me to say? No, I'm leaving, because this makes me sick and besides... we have waited too long. - And Sandra, she has disappeared so... Faustino? - Finally, here she is. Did you find him? - No. I knew how this story was going to end. With modern youth you don't ever know what will happen. to mark the X on the SISAL. - If things go like this, .. you better not marry this young man. He will make you suffer. Why are you meddling? These are my problems! And don't talk about anyone! Nobody, understand? Everyone, just Leave me alone! Sandra! What are you doing here? Can you tell what you're looking at? - Sandra... - Outside! - But I... I'm sorry, but we will not set foot again in this house, .. until this girl changes. Why would anyone come? He would have done a somersault to give this young man a job. - It looks like it wasn't destined to happen. - They could have married. - Deep down, they made a good couple. - That's just propaganda. She was also all sweetness before entering .. to the vicarage. As soon as we left, he began to let go of me. on the face the first insults. These ignorant .. they don't understand all the beauty that there was .. it's over, definitely evaporated. Illusions, idealists, platonists, that's what you are. Let's go.. before it's too late and that bland young man arrives. - Let's not exaggerate. - He's a good boy. Do you want to be right? Come on, it's better. Faustino! - Dont be like that. - Goodbye. Goodbye. - You don't have anything to say, huh? - Things that happen. Here comes the earthquake! I'm leaving! Come on, quick, inside. They are finally gone. I find them unfriendly. - Just leave it be? - Who is saying anything? How nice! How could you speak to your uncles like that? - Dad, I'm going out. - How? More? Have you become a key - I can leave? - No! You don't move from here! - Sandra! If you don't come here... - Let her go! Don't you realize that if she can't see Giulio, she will die. A girl from a good family does not go out at night... You don't remember that Easter night, many years ago, .. that we discussed? She ran away from home... What do you mean, that Sandra had left because of me? Beh, both of you. But a little more to you. - You're right dad! - I'm going to slap you! Is that any way to speak? Come here!! I didn't say anything! We have done everything that could be done. - It's not our fault. - Professor. Professor. Do not sleep. Casari has been scrubbed... the goals for the face of his portrait! It seemed like a prophecy. But at the Naples-Rome we will have you make a portrait in the strongest alluminum metal. bombproof! - Just two little words to San Gennaro. - I am counting on it. - We will see who will finish first in the League. if Naples or Rome. Go Naples! - High! We will get our revenge! Go Naples! - Let's say goodbye here. - But the train's not leaving yet. - I prefer it this way. - Ines... Would you let me call you Agnes for once? - Of course. - I wanted to... I wanted to give you my address, but I better not. I will never be able to tell you how grateful I am. You have helped me to see reason. Not all men are mean, selfish, disloyal. I hope that you are never alone. Yes, never. Never, Giulio. When you are alone it is so easy to be fooled. - It's so easy to be wrong. - Ines... - Yes? Nothing. Farewell, Ines. Goodbye, Giulio. - I'm going. - What? Oh.. - I'm going. - Go get out! Just go away! Go now, you can't talk to him tonight. - Good night, Father. - Goodnight! Did you go to see the game? I did not see it. - Do you need anything? - Hell No! It's true that five is a lot. Next year we will only score two. Agree? - You going? - Right away, excuse me. How little and sporty it is! Fly away! Oh my Madonna, forgive me. That boy makes me curse. Forgive me, my Madonna. Same train, same schedule. Like the other time, when you came to me. You are always a woman who is a slave to routines. You were here to spy on me. Did you want to make sure I was leaving? If you wanted so much to talk to me. Here I am. Why were you still cheating on me? I didn't want to convince myself of... that you're just a scoundrel. - Good thing you've changed your mind. - You have given up blackmail, better this way. - What have you said? Come on! Letters, telegrams, threats. It was all so childish, ridiculous. Who has absolved you of your responsibility? My adorable "Madame Bovary". You come to Rome and you think it is different from Salerno. Instead Rome is smaller than Salerno. Nice that boy you were talking to today. I do not understand you. I just understand how vulgar you are. Come on, Inés, let's finish! Seduced and abandoned. Not your type. I am not naive. As for the matter of your expectant child you mention, .. I admit it could be true, but who says that it is mine? Ines, no, what are you doing? What are you doing, have you lost your mind? - Leave me. - No, I won't leave you, if you... I have nothing here. Yes, it's true, I wanted to kill you. I wanted to at least get revenge. But someone has helped me think clearly, and it has saved me. And now go. And don't look for me ever again. I will never allow you .. to see your son. Better to beg, or kill him with my own hands, .. to give him a father like you. Ladies and Gentlemen to the train! All aboard!. Ma'am! - Fiorenzo you are showing off. - Yes, tonight is my night. - Giulio, you're failing me. - Bah, what do you want? You don't know how to play anymore. - Always thinking about her, eh? - If Sandra knew... - Enough, alright? - Me? - Yes, you too. Giulio, the attack is coming .. from Rome. Here, suck this. - Tonight he can not shoot. - Come on, let's see if you're right. - Be still! - What are you so touchy? - I'm what I want to be! - But what do you have in your pocket? - Carry the sweet memory of that one. - Let me see! - Leave him alone! - I'll split open your face! Are you crazy? - I'm going to kick you out of here! - We were joking. - Giulio, there is a girl looking for you. - What? - Good? - Ah, it's you. You were expecting someone else, eh? Unfortunate! And you have the courage to say it. But this time I'm going to explain it to you. - As true as my name is Sandra... - But no, Giulio... - Stay there, ruffian! - Sandra! - The three still. You help this scoundrel with that... But this time it doesn't end like this! - This time I'll fix it! - Stop it, let's go outside! Do not touch me! - Do you want to calm down? - I haven't started yet! If you want to kill yourself, do it outside my premises, understood? - Come on brave. - Walk! - You walk! You two walk! - However, Sandra is right. - It's a viper! Giulio, if you need help, let me know! Now explain. Who is that disgusting? - If we start to offend... - She is a saint! A Madonna! - It's a lady. - And what am I, a maid? Who? Why were you with her? How long have you known her? - What have you done? - Nothing. - Oh nothing - I am telling you no! - You say "no" as if it were a hundred "yes". - You are right! - Ah, you see it? I barely know her name is Inés and I don't know who she is! It has nothing to do with love. She is a beautiful woman, .. but it has nothing remotely to do with love. - And why were you together? - She was feeling bad. - And you have "consoled" her! - But come here, Sandra. Don't touch me or I'll leave your face... looking like a cheese grater! - Will you let me speak, yes or no? But what do you want to talk about? I was desperate.. first waiting for you, and then looking for you like crazy. With my uncle who could give you a job, and we could have got married. - And you at soccer with your girl friend lover! - You're a fool! The idiot is you if you think I'm going to keep putting up with you! With your uncle's help we can fix it. I want to marry you. Marry me? I'd rather kill myself. I do not want to see you anymore! - Come here, Sandra! - Let me! You will find out! - But are you crazy? - You don't know me yet! Now I'm going to show you what I am capable of! Sandra! Crazy! Sandra! Sandra! Are you going to tell me what happened to you today? Today? Today I helped prevent a tragedy. - Now it is OK! - "It's okay"? Look. - No, Giulio! - But what are you afraid of? - Thesafety is on. - Where did you get it? - She was carrying it. - Did she want to kill himself? - No, she wanted to kill him. - Kill who? - Yes, kill a guy with a car... - Get rid of it immediately. When we get married it can help us if thieves come to harm. Throw it away immediately! But where, and if they see me? We throw it away later. - If I touch it, will it go off? - I told you no. Look. But what are you doing? You are such a brat. Why did you throw it away? They cost a lot of money. Let's hope the train takes her away. And now you can explain, quickly. Yes "explain"... It's a word. - But what happens now? - You don't have even one cigarette. If you don't smoke, you can't explain? Hey? Go buy one. And who has any money? Our thousand lire you have spent completely today, eh? - With that woman. - No, I still have twenty lire. Only twenty lire? Then go buy two cigarettes. Didn't I promised to buy you an ice cream? It will be small, but I buy it for you. - No, buy the cigarettes. - No, I'll buy you the ice cream. I told you to buy yourself the cigarettes! It's okay. Don't be angry, we will both go to my uncle .. together to talk about job prospects. We will manage. And do you know what I tell you? It has also been a beautiful Sunday. A Sunday. A Sunday like any other, .. In which we have tried to forget bad thoughts .. the pain, the injustice, the war and poverty, that six days .. of the week are like sentinels on the sidewalks. You and us, from dawn to dusk .. of a Sunday of life.
