You want her back, don't you? How long were you planning that trip, Mr. Myles? JOHN: Not long. Just a few days. DETECTIVE: So why all of a sudden? JOHN: She wasn't well. I thought a vacation would help to get away from everything. The stress. DETECTIVE: Stress? What kind of stress was she under? JOHN: She had a miscarriage. ♪♪ [BALLAD] JOHN: She really wanted to have kids. All her friends did. And... it was hard for me because... we were not in a position financially to... have 'em. It seemed like she was looking for something... between us... that was missing, and... I was always busy trying to deal with... an investment that I made on the gallery, and... I didn't wanna bother her with that. [CLICK] [TWIG SNAPS] [FOOTSTEPS IN DIRT] [RUSTLING] - [RUSTLING] - [BIRD CHIRPS] [FLIES BUZZING] The tide is really coming in. We should head back. Okay. [BEEP] [BEEP] Are you kidding me? Stupid phone. It's supposed to work everywhere. That's why they call it a satellite phone. I'm sorry, what? What did you say? What? Were you just making fun of me? I was just saying something. What was it? This phone is not working. Oh. JOHN: There was just something about this island that didn't feel right. I couldn't tell her 'cause I didn't wanna freak her out. She seemed... happy. I didn't wanna take that away from her. ♪ Wake up, wake up ♪ ♪ To the sound of warning ♪ - Here you go. - Oh! ♪ Get up, get up ♪ ♪ They're coming for you ♪ ♪ Who do you think ♪ Taste like ground lizard. [CHUCKLES] It's not bad. - Yeah? - Yes. It's not bad. This place is amazing, isn't it? Mm. Yeah, it is. ♪ So feel fine, feel fine ♪ ♪ And don't freak out ♪ Hey. Yeah? Do you know what I love about you? Tell me. You... are easy to get a smile from. - Like this! - Oh, fuck... [THUD] - Ugh! Goddamn it. - I'm sorry, babe. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. - Here, you can have mine. - No, no, it's okay. What's wrong? Nothing. [SIGHS] I don't know where she wouldn't have these moments where... she'd just lash out at me. [WOOD CREAKING] Do you hear that? Could be those sounds are a Sasquatch or something. [TWIG SNAPS] Did you hear that? - What? - Shh. [TWIG SNAPS] Oh... [LAUGHING] - You're such a wuss! - How dare you. I wasn't scared. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. Big tough guy. You're my big, strong man. - Yes, I am. - [LAUGHS] You know what I love about you? - My good looks. - Oh! Oh, so sure of yourself! ♪♪ Did you get that phone to work? No. Still can't get a signal on this island. But it's a satellite phone. It's supposed to work everywhere, right? Yup. Maybe the satellite is on the other side of the planet, so we just have to wait for it to come around. Yeah, that's probably all we have to do. You... You are fucked up. I am? Yeah. No. [LAUGHS] For the first time in a long, long time, we were spending time together on our own. It seemed like our relationship was getting better. We were happy together. Not thinking about anything else but each other. He lives. Come on, let's go. What time is it? Oh, gosh, it's like, maybe 2:00. What? Oh, yeah. You've been sleeping all day. I didn't wanna wake you, but... now I'd really like to get going 'cause we're gonna lose light. Where we going again? Up there. [GULLS CAWING] You okay, baby? Uh... - You wanna sit down? - Huh? - You wanna sit for a sec? - Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. [SIGHS] [GROANS] Want some water? You sure? Yeah. Oh, wow. Wow. Look at this. This whole thing is just... is just resting on this rock, this one little rock. Isn't that amazing? It's so powerful, so powerful. Come on. I don't think I'm gonna make it to the top. Well, maybe you should have another cigarette. You know what? Maybe I will. Okay, well, maybe I'll see you at the top then. DETECTIVE: Did you try to get her some help? JOHN: I asked her to. But she didn't wanna. She said there's nothing wrong with her. And when I asked her again... she got very mad at me. I don't know why she was so unhappy. Maybe it was just me. She wasn't always like that. Baby... I'm sorry. I'm tired. [TWIG SNAPS] [FOOTSTEPS] [FOOTSTEPS CONTINUE] [FOOTSTEPS] [THUMPS] [SCREAMING] Ah! Fuck. Oh! Oh! Oh! [GRUNTS] Ah, oh! - This isn't fun at all! - Aw, come on. There's a big surprise on the other side. Trust me. It's worth it. [LAUGHING] Oh, my God. That was so perfect. [LAUGHING] Okay, so you think this is funny, huh? Yeah, actually. Don't! - [LAUGHS] - John, don't. Don't. John, don't. You're still laughing. - I'm not. - You're still laughing. John, stop it! - You stop it. - No. Stop. [SPLAT] [LAUGHING] Baby, I'm sorry. [STRAINING, LAUGHING] Come on! Eat it! Come on! [LAUGHING] [JOHN LAUGHING] Whoo! Whoo! Oh! - [LAUGHING] - [SPLASHING] Whoo! Come on! What? What is it? Hey! [GUNSHOT] I thought you got rid of that thing when I asked you to. I did. You did not. Just brought it for extra precautions, okay? You're right. I'm sorry I didn't get rid of the gun when you asked me to. Why do you always lie to me? Oh, I'm sorry. Is this funny to you? - [HONK] - Jesus! What's this for, huh? What the hell is wrong with you? Why are you so angry all the time? You don't have any respect for me, do you? Amy, come on! [BEEPING] - Hello? - Boater. Hey, you're alive! How's it going over there? Not so good. [CHUCKLES] Surprise, surprise. When is it ever good with you, buddy? Fuck off. What's going on now? Worried she's gonna find out what we're up to. She's already mad at me 'cause I brought the gun. Oh. That's not good. You got a big problem then. You're not much of a friend. I just work for you, remember? You don't pay me to sympathize with you. So what's the plan then? I don't know yet. I'll let you know later. So why'd you call? Miss me? Stop joking around, man. All right. I apologize. I wanna make sure you don't call 'cause I had to lie to her that this phone has no signal. Oh. Why would you say that? It's my only excuse to get away, to try and get a signal to make a call. Do I really have to spell this out? All right, just let me know. Everything will be ready. You know what I think, Mr. Myles? You didn't really go to that island to spend time with your wife. So why don't you just be honest with me and tell me why you took her there. The gallery wasn't doing too good. I was gonna close it down. But then I got this phone call... about this old native plaque. WOMAN: We're calling to inform you, sir, that we have not received rental payment for your gallery for over 60 days. Your current outstanding balance must be paid within five business days. Sir? Okay. I'll look into it. Thank you. Have a seat. Thank you. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] He wants to know if you like them. Yes. They're beautiful. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] He's saying that this collection brings him good luck, but to their people, it can be quite the opposite, and he wants to know if you know why. I'm not exactly sure. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] Because they believe as they're told. I see. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] "Cursed Shrine?" Have I heard of The Cursed Shrine? Yes. Do you believe? I'm not familiar with its history. [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I found out that it was placed there to commemorate a small tragic event. That's why the locals are afraid to set foot on that island. They believe that there's something protecting it. I felt it. But somehow... it seemed to draw her in. She seemed to be so curious about it. Like a siren. I wasn't afraid of the creature. They were just tales. She seemed to be in a different world. But it was scaring me. It was beyond her grief. It was something... something else. Amy! Amy. Amy? Hey. Wake up. Wake up, Amy. Amy. Wake up, Amy. Yes. Wake up. Are you hurt? Amy? How's your head, baby? Can you move? Come on. Slowly, slowly, slowly. Slowly. Watch your head. Watch your head. Are you okay, baby? Hey. Hey. What's wrong? Hey, hey, hey. Ah! Are you okay? Let's go back tomorrow to get this treated in town. Why? These cuts are pretty deep, babe. They might get infected. It's not that deep. It's just a scratch. From what? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? I don't... I can't remember. - You don't remember? - Mm. Why? I don't know. You blacked out? No. I don't know. I don't remember. Hey. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, you are. Let's just change the bandage tomorrow. I'm sure it'll be fine. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [RAINING CONTINUES] [HEAVY BREATHING] [MOTORBOAT APPROACHING] [STARTER FAILING] [STARTER FAILING] [LINE RINGING] [RINGING] Yeah. Hey, it's me. Boater, phone. - What? - Phone! - Who is it? - Take it. - Bring it to me. - Take it. Hello? It's me. My fucking boat doesn't start, so I need you to come and pick us up. What do you mean? Did you check the gas? Yeah, man, I checked, I checked. It doesn't start. Can you come pick us up? Dude, that's gonna take all day. From the moment I took that plaque, I felt something had woken up. Something... evil. [PANTING] The island went silent. I could hear everything. It felt like there was something lurking behind me. [WOOD CREAKING] [TREE FALLS] Following me. Watching me. - [RUSTLING] - [WOOD CREAKING] [CREAKING, RUSTLING] [CREAKING, RUSTLING] [TWIG SNAPS] Amy? Have you been standing there for long? I didn't see you. Our boat wouldn't... didn't work, so I called my assistant to come pick us up. I got the phone to finally work. Excellent. Listen, we're gonna have to head back home. Why? Uh... 'cause you're hurt. [SCOFFS] No, I'm not. Okay, babe... our boat doesn't work, and... Your assistant can just bring us another one, right? Our vacation's just getting started. That thing that the locals fear it for started to get in my head. How about this, hmm? I'm gonna look around for a sec. I'll be right back. Okay. Hello? Who's there? Oh, don't be afraid. I'm not gonna hurt you. Oh, it's okay. Shh... Shh... Amy! Amy! Amy! [PANTING] No, no. Amy! Where are you? [RUSTLING] [RUSTLING] Amy? Amy. Amy, wait! Amy! [FOOTSTEPS] [FOOTSTEPS] [SCREAMS] [GROANS] You lied to me. [PANTING] You told me you brought me here so we could spend time together. Baby, I'm sorry. I really messed up, okay? I called my assistant because our boat wouldn't start, and I asked him... I asked him to... Listen to me. He's dead, okay? He's dead because of me. I don't know what happened. Something must have attacked him. But we have to get out of here. He deserved it. You don't mean that. How come I'm the last person you care about, huh? Amy, I care about you. This is why I didn't want you to know. There's something very wrong here. I don't know what it is. And we need to get out of this island. We need to get your arm treated. Let's just go. I can see it in your eyes. We're not working out. Don't say that. Baby, you're not making... You're gonna leave me. You're gonna leave me when we get back. Amy, come on. [GROANS] This is gonna be hard to believe. I know it's gonna sound crazy. [GRUNTING, HOWLING] She turned into this thing. I know it's real. I know it. [BRANCHES SNAPPING] [LOW GROWLING] [GROWLS] [GROWLS] [SNARLING] [SPLASH] [GROWLING] [ROARING] [ROAR] [LOW GROWLING] [DISTANT MOTOR] Mr. Myles. You were the last one to be with your wife, and now she's missing. Show me in this map... where you last saw her.
