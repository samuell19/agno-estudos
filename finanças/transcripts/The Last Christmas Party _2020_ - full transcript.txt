(air whooshing) - [Steven] Well, you really cleaned up the place for me. - [Caroline] Yeah, I, I hope I can find your ID in this mess. - Yeah, it's going to be a real needle in the haystack. - Or maybe it's right here. - Hmm. Thank you. - All good? You know, I coulda just given it back to you at the party tonight. - I was in the area. - Well, now that you've got your school ID, where are you heading now? - Are you kicking me out? - I got stuff to do. - Yeah, clearly like tidying up. - You got a better suggestion? - Yeah, I've got an hour to kill before I have to go downtown. - An hour? An hour is all I get? - Uh, who said I was talking about you? Sorry. Hey, I just wanted to see you tonight and uh, hopefully before. Even though it's not much time. - Well uh, I'm sure we could figure out something to do. - Something fun. It's a little hot in here. - Yeah. You know the radiator gets too hot in the winter. It's kind of ironic. - Oh. - [Jun] It's like two thousand dollars for a ticket, Ed. - I know, but there's gotta to be like cheaper prices somewhere. - I mean, maybe we buy our tickets months in advance, but if I want to get to South Africa this January it is literally two thousand dollars. - Well, I mean, couldn't you just like go on some sort of website or something? - I spent all night looking for deals and I couldn't find anything. I'm really sorry, but I just don't think I can blow that much cash to see you for only a week. - I mean, that makes sense. Like if the tickets are really that final. - You're the one that's been nagging me to save money. - I know, I know. I just know like I'm going to miss you, you know? I really wanted my family to meet you. Actually you know what? Don't, don't worry about it, okay? It's cool, it's fine. - I'm sorry. - Don't worry about it. - But winter break will fly by. - No, it won't. But that's okay. - [Laura] You know, you're not supposed to eat ice cream in the winter. - [Charlie] I don't care, I'm going to do it anyway 'cause I do it all the time back home. - I guess things get pretty crazy in the wild West. California? (laughter) - Sure. Well, I guess I'll have to send a postcard from the frontier. - And I'll send one back to my lone cowboy out there. - Hey, so are you going to come to that Christmas party I was telling you about? - Definitely. - Awesome. Look I, I just don't want to overstep any boundaries. If he wouldn't be cool with it then, - Charlie, I'm cool with it. - Thanks. - You don't need to thank me. - Well, I'm sorry to run out now, but I'll see you there. - Totally. - Great. - And uh, about the party tonight I hope there's mistletoe. - [Caroline] Come on, we're going to be late. Don't worry about it, Jun come on. - [Jun] I think she moved her stash. Faye might be on to us. - My gosh, does that mean that we shouldn't steal her weed anymore? - She gets high and eats all my food. I don't think it's the end of the world if we take a bit. An eye for an eye. - Okay, but like I've gotten high and eat your food. - I've noticed. Found it. I'm taking less than a gram this time anyway, unless you want some. - Uh no, I'm not smoking tonight. - Suit yourself. What's that for? - Oh, this is blackmail. Nice. Don't worry, I'm just sending it to the boys. - Shit, Manny, I've been cleaning up this apartment all day. Why do you think I've been doing that? I thought we were gathering a few pals, not throwing a rager. - Hey. - Hi. - How's it going boys? - [Ed] Hey uh, so we might be in a little bit of a conundrum. A few more people were invited than expected. - It's not any specific person's fault. - It looks like someone's going on the naughty list. - Okay, the more the merrier. - Things won't be very merry if there's not enough alcohol. - [Caroline] So either we have to turn people away or someone's going to have to go out and get more drinks. - Charlie, you want to pick up some booze for us? - No, Laura's going to be here any second and I kind of want to be here for that. - What about all the people I got coming over? - Manny, it's your fault so I think it's on you bro. - Fuck fine. - Don't get lost out there, Manny. - Don't worry, Rudolph knows the way. - You're amazing. - You invited Laura. What's going on with that? - You got a sec actually? - [Steven] Manny, Manny, Manny, Manny. Uh, found someone better. - Hi, give me like one second. I gotta talk to Charlie about something. - Yeah, fine, just tell Manny to bring the booze up okay? - Okay. - [Charlie] I should be happy, right? I should be happy, but I'm worried and this whole long distance open relationship is, - Did the date go well? - [Charlie] Yeah, yes, it went great. It's just, - You want her to break up with her boyfriend? - No. - Yeah. - But like, yeah right. Yeah, I do. - Okay look the whole open relationship long distance thing it's a, it's a rookie move. I bet she's not even that invested. - Yes, yes and why should I be worried about ruining her relationship with Greg if she's just going to be here and he's going to be, - Having sex with other people on the other side of the country. - I should have did something. - Yeah. You and anyone that's ever been in a relationship ever. (grunting) - [Caroline] Hi. Hey Mr. - Hey you. What's up? - This roof is great for parties. - Technically we are not supposed to have alcohol up here for safety reasons. - Charlie, you mind? - Sure. - Come here. - What's up? - What's up with you? - Why'd you you have Charlie leave? - I don't know, maybe I wanted to spend some alone time with you. - Okay, well you didn't have to be an ass about it. - Okay. Well, you know, I can always call him back if you'd like. - Would you mind? - Yeah? - Yeah, can you just. - Charlie! - Charlie! - Charlie! Then again you know, I'm not going to see ya till after break, so. - Are you gonna miss me? - You make it difficult, you know? You know, I've always wanted to see the Rockefeller tree on Christmas. - I don't know, it's just a big tree. - Yeah, no shit. So it's a really big, really pretty tree. - What, you don't like? You don't like trees? Are you too cool for trees? I'm Steven, I'm too cool for trees. - Okay. I don't know, maybe my dad didn't let us have a tree, so. - What? No, everyone has a tree. - Well, when my dad was a kid, his house kind of burnt down when the Christmas tree caught on fire. Yeah. - Oh my God, that's insane. Wait, wait, so my parents are divorced right? - Okay. - So I had two Christmas trees while you had none. - Don't rub it in. - I can see, Christmas decorations are nice though. All December, the lights, snow. It's romantic, isn't it? - Oh, I could do without the weather. - Oh, come on. Look at the view, tell me it's not beautiful. Honestly, it's a really pretty night only thing prettier seems to be you. What? - Nothing, nothing. - Okay. - It's just you've given me that line before you know that, right? - Sure. - Like those exact same words. - I didn't realize it was illegal to repeat yourself. Look, why don't we just take our drinks, curl up in our room for a bit. It's cold out here. - And miss the whole party? - I'm sure we'll come up with something to do. - You know, one of these days you're gonna have to take me out to dinner. - Yeah, but we're not really about that. Are we? - What does that mean? - [Charlie] It means what it means, we're not really about that. - How are we not about that? We're dating. - You think we're dating, dating? - [Caroline] I mean, what else would you call this? A fling. I think we're a little bit past that. - [Charlie] Okay, well have we been on any dates before? - [Caroline] We've been on three dates. - No, we've been to three parties together. - Well, we've had sex twice. - Look, forgive me for not wanting to be serious yet. - So we're just a fling? - Yeah. - [Caroline] Okay, cool. Yeah, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go to the bathroom but I'll be like one sec, I'll be right back. (subtle music) - I really love all those little places you find in Greenwich village, you know? - I know what you mean, man. It has like this great bar scene, right? Especially at night, you know? Imagine I live right, - Let's not fall off the roof. All right, gnarly party am I right? Oh my God, are you Steve? - What's your name? - I mean, I heard he was good looking but come on. Come on, are you kidding me? Look at this guy's jaw line, that's ridiculous. Is that real? - I don't see it. - Oh my God. - Thank you sir, appreciate it. - Hey, it's nice to meet you, man. - Steven, this is Bud. - Oh Bud, what's up brother? How you doing? - I'm good, I'm good. - How are you? - And who's this? - Serena, this is Serena. - [Melissa] Yeah, honestly like don't even worry about Serena. I'm Melissa, nice to meet you. She's fine, like she's chilling. - Why don't we take Serena off the roof before she falls off? - That's actually a good idea. - Great. - He's smart. - [Melissa] Yeah. - Am I in trouble? - She's cute man. - Yo, Melissa. What's the rush? - [Melissa] What's with the sudden interest? - [Steven] Gotta take care of my guests right? Any complaints? - Yeah, this one guy on your roof's a bit of a prick. - Damn, don't talk about poor Bud like that. - I'm gonna just uh, I'm gonna just head in, right. - So last night in the city, huh? - [Caroline] Charlie, do we have anything left to drink? - We are pretty much dry, but we do have this. That's kinda it so we're, oh. Okay. Hey Laura. - Who's this? - This is Caroline. - Oh wait, you're Laura. Hi, it's nice to meet you. I've heard, Charlie told me all about you. - Charlie hasn't really told me much about you. - Oh, okay. - Yes, let's get this party going again. (upbeat music) - Oh my God! What the fuck bitch? - Give me the paper towels. - Fuck. - Hey. Can you help me out? - Yeah. - Try not to look at it, it is fucking gross. Hey, are you okay? You just seem a little off and I wanted to check in. - Yeah, I'm fine. - Right. - I mean, this is not how I expected my night to go. - Well you know what? I got this, you should be having fun. You should go hang out with Steven. You okay? - Do you ever think about how much time you waste on utter bullshit? - All the time. But cleaning up vomit comes with the package, I guess. As long as you're all right, then I'm good. - I'm fine, everything's fine. - You know, I actually uh, I always thought you were too good for him. - Excuse me? - I got to say it. Steven can be a real prick sometimes and I don't know why he's pulling right now, but I can guess. - Do us a favor, buddy. Show us it all works out sometimes. (subtle music) Jun, hey! What's up? - [Jun] I'm just heading back to the apartment to change. - [Caroline] Okay, you gonna come back? - Nah, I think I'm done for tonight. - Yeah. I gotta go to the bathroom, but do you wanna come back upstairs with me and we could say goodbye to Ed and Charlie and then we can go home? - I don't really want to see Ed right now. - Why, did something happen? - I'll tell you about it later. I have to get out of this shirt, so. - I'm sorry about whatever happened with Ed. Wait vomit, you literally just. - I'm going to go. - I'll see you later. - Yeah. - Goodnight. Merry Christmas. (subtle music) - [Charlie] Hey Steven? - Sorry Charlie, you mind? - [Charlie] Hey, do you mind? I need to talk hosting with my roommate in private. - Okay, should I leave? - Give us a second. - [Charlie] Roof top now. - Wait for me, all right? - I can't believe you, Steven. Of all the manipulative things you've done, cheating on someone when they're in the next room. - Dude, what are you talking about? - Why are you being so awful to Caroline? - Okay first, Caroline's fine. Right? Quit being such a white Knight. - I'm not sure she is. - Yo bud. Mike let's bounce. - Yeah, let's bail. - Yo Mike? You seen Caroline? - [Mike] Uh yeah, she's around here somewhere. - Hey. - Hey. - What do you want? - Can we talk upstairs? - Party treating you all right? - Yeah, it's your average mediocre college party. Drugs and drinks and disappointment. Sorry to hear about that, I'm stupid. - No you're not. Steven, why don't you want to date me? Is it something I said, is it, is it the way that I'm, - No it's not. - Oh, it's not you it's me. Seriously? That's the line you're gonna give me? - Okay, listen. The whole committed relationship, you know, eternal love and all that horse shit. I've been there. - Have you? I couldn't tell from the limited effort that you put into this relationship. - Okay calm down, really for a second. You know, back in high school, I used to have this girl and we used to skip class and drive around in her car. - She sounds like something. - She was. Charming, loudmouthed. A bit all over the place, but like in the most entertaining way possible. - How did it end? - Saw her with another guy. No warning just happened, you know? And she told me that I needed to understand my place in her life. Even though I thought we were, I didn't know you could use another human being like that. - No, you know what, Steven? I don't want your emotional baggage on my doorstep. - Sorry for the burden. - No, no, you know what? Fuck this, fuck you. Your head is so far up your ass. I don't want to be having this conversation. I want to have a good time tonight. What do you want from me? - [Steven] I just, please just, I just want to say I'm sorry. I'm sorry that you that, I'm sorry that I made you feel like we were something we weren't. - No, it's, it's fine. It's totally fine that we're a fling 'cause now I know where we stand. You know, it opens me up. There's a lot of cute guys at this party. - No one's holding you back. - [Steven] Manny, where are you? At the party? Where's the booze? Down the street? Whose place? Let me get this straight, you're at a different party instead of your own, the last party that all of these boys are going to be at for months? Yeah, the party, the party is fine. It's not the same without you. You got to go already? All right. Yeah, I'll see you soon, buddy. - Hey, what's going on? - I don't know. I think I just screwed up. - Well, you can't be having a worst night than she is. - Hey, party's still going? - Not really man. People mostly went home. Are you good? - Yeah. I have cookies. - Like edibles? - Oatmeal raisin. - Sure, yeah whatever. - Yeah, okay sure. - Yeah. - My grandma's recipe. - Thanks. - Thank you. - [Melissa] Pretty nice night in the city, huh? How is it possible for me to lose the host at his own party? - Well you found me now. - Guess that means I should go in. - No. Let's, let's take a picture. - Okay. - Okay. - Oh God, you made us look like a couple. - That's a really good picture of you, yeah. - Thank you. - No. - [Charlie] Wish me luck. (phone rings) - Her again? - Yeah, can't seem to take a hint. - I know what you mean. - In what way? - Like, some people just got to get a clue. - Yeah? - Yeah, like I keep getting hit up over and over again by the same jealous guy. - Does he need to learn his place in your life? - Yeah, I guess you could say that. Is something up? - Hey Charlie. My life is a shit show. - Hey, hey, don't talk like that, okay? - You would never give up on me, right? - Of course not. - Oh uh, hey. Mind if we talk? - Laura, I've been wanting to say this all night. I think you are so pretty. - Get away from my boyfriend. Charlie, let's go upstairs. - Charlie. (subtle music) (muffled conversation) - Hey, little buddy. Your little girlfriend left. - Stop calling me little buddy. - [Caroline] Okay why? - Because I hate it. I've always hated it. I just don't want to be talked down to like I'm a fucking preschooler anymore, okay? - I'll just call you Charlie. - All right. Caroline. - Caroline? Okay, that's enough isn't it? - What I saw you with that other girl. Let me have my fun. Aren't those the terms of our not a relationship? - Okay, don't harass the kid just cause you're angry at me. Leave him out of this. - I don't need you to defend me, Steven. I'm done being a part of this fucked up game. - Charlie. - [Charlie] Fuck you. - Proud of yourself? - Are you proud of yourself? - Honestly? No. - Good, I'm glad you've got some sort of a clue. - Look, come on, I'm trying to be mature here. - No, it's way past that. - Listen to me for one second, please. I'm trying to say I'm sorry. Okay, I know that I really, - [Caroline] Okay, thank you, thank you for the apology. It's a Christmas miracle. You've grown a heart. - Caroline. Caroline. - No! (subtle music) - [Bud] Anyway, did I hear you say you did some modeling work or, or did I assume that? 'Cause I swear I seen you on, - [Steven] Party's over. Get out. - I'm a little busy here, man. Thank you. But like I was saying. - I said get out. - Whatever man. Great party, by the way, I had a wonderful time stepping on broken beer bottles and shit. - Hey, do you want me to stick around? - Sorry. Party's over. - All right. - Fuck. - [Ed] I understand, it's a lot of money. Listen, listen, mom. I know why you want me to do this, okay? I know it'd be easier on you. I know, if I had to move back to South Africa, it wouldn't be the end of the world. It's just, sorry mom, my phone is about to die so if anything pops up I'll just text you, okay? Yeah, no, no I'm packed. Love you too, bye. - [Charlie] You missed the deadline? So that's it, no visa? - That's how it looks. - [Charlie] Ed, I'm so sorry. That sucks. - I mean, I'll just have to go back home come graduation and you know, I'll figure it all out. - I'm going to miss you. I'm gonna miss you a lot and Jun. - [Caroline] So how smashed are we getting tonight? - Well, Ed has an early flight tomorrow, so we'll probably keep it pretty light. - But doesn't he normally stick around for Christmas time? - No, I wish. He stayed last Christmas so he could meet my parents, but this year he's going to South Africa for Christmas. - Well, that just means he'll miss you more. - Shit. - Hey. Hey Faye. - You two going out? - Yeah. - I won't be home tonight. - I'll be home late. - Have fun or whatever. - [Jun] So she's doing this whole show on like the Asian American identity and like being torn between two cultures and I'm like, this bitch doesn't even speak Korean. She's third generation. She's not torn between shit. - Yeah, which I mean, she is Asian though. Doesn't that mean anything? And it's not like your Korean's great. - I spoke it well enough when I actually went to Korea, unlike a certain someone. - So what? You're just jealous. - Yes, but that doesn't mean I'm not better than her. Wait, hold still. - Oh no, no, no, don't. - Hold still. - You're such a hipster. - It's not hipster to have fun. - Uh huh. - You know, Rain really liked this one photo I took of her the other day. - Oh, did she? - Yeah, she's going to use it as the cover photo for her shitty low FI band's new album. - Ah, smile. - Who's the hipster now? - Okay, no, no. Come on, you took a photograph of me so I get one of you. - Fine, don't make me look bad. Take it from a little higher. - I'm sure you'll look great, despite my clear lack of photographic talent. Hey uh, so listen, uh I need to tell you something. I recently I just found out that. (knocking) I actually, you know what? Let me get that. - Hey. - Hey, how are you doing? We're with Manny. Somebody give me a shot. - Yeah Manny went to uh, drinks are on this. Sorry Charlie, no Laura yet. - Sorry. - Where's Steven? - [Ed] Uh, the roof. - Scoot together you too. - What? - Come on, get together. - Cheers. Let's go upstairs. - Sure, all right. - Laura, hey. - Hey Jun. - Charlie, Laura's here. - I can see that. Hey. - Thanks for the invite. - Thanks for coming. Do you maybe want to go somewhere more private? I have something I need to talk to you about. - [Charlie] Yeah sure, sure, follow me. - Aw, isn't that adorable? So what were you going to tell me? - Sorry what? - You said you found something out? - Oh, I can't remember. It must not have been anything important. - [Laura] This is so pretty Ed. You did a great job decorating this place. - Thank you. No, I'm just kidding. It was all Jun. - You decorated his place? - I basically live here. - All right guys, beer pong is ready. We are very low on booze though. - [Jun] Oh, that's all right. Ed's a lightweight anyway. - Oh sure, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm the one who's the lightweight. I'm the one who gets tipsy after a single beer. - [Jun] I don't get tipsy after a single beer. It takes at least two. Alright, get ready to lose. - All right, come on. - All right, let's see it Ed. There it is! - Not bad for a lightweight who's a few drinks down huh? - Nice work. Yes, let's get this party going. - Got your text. - Oh my God! What the fuck bitch? - Jun, are you okay? You can clean up upstairs in the toilet. - [Caroline] Hand me the paper towels? - Yo Melissa, she did it again. - Looks like shit's going down. - God this is freaking disgusting. - Hey, how's it going? - Fan fucking tastic. - Yikes. First the thing with Ed and now this. - What thing with Ed? - About not getting the documents signed or you know? - Did he not get his visa? - Uh. - He didn't tell me. - [Laura] Hey Jun, you okay? - Yeah, thank you Laura, you're all good. - [Charlie] You know, it's more complicated than it sounds and maybe you should just go talk to him. - I'm going to head out. Can't stay in this. - Charlie, Charlie, how'd that date go? - It was good. Yeah, hi. Hi yeah, I gotta um. Hey, hey. Did Jun already leave? - Yeah, she bolted out of here. She wants to change her clothes. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Ah shit happens, man. - No, not the vomit. Hey, listen. I may have just told her about the visa. I'm sorry. - Oh shit. - I didn't know that you hadn't told her yet. - Was she mad? - I don't know. She didn't say anything, she just stormed out. - It's, it's okay. Just, just make sure Manny's friends don't destroy the place. - All right. (knocking) - Hey. - Hey. - You look better. - Not a high bar. - Sorry about what happened at the party. I can't believe Manny would invite people like that over. - Typical, people behave stupidly, it happens. - Faye home? - No. So you're going to explain yourself or what? Ed, I know about the visa. How could you be such a dumb ass? Are you just a fucking idiot? - I'm sorry. I don't want to hear that you're sorry. I want to hear that you're going to fix this. - Okay, think about the position I'm in. I tried, I tried bringing up moving to the states to my mother. I told her I was thinking about it and she begged me not to, almost forbid me. - You're a grown man. - Okay I know, but I can't break my mother's heart, Jun. My father is not around anymore. So hearing that her son is thinking of permanently leaving her, moving to another country, 8,000 miles away. - You have two brothers over there. - But I'm the responsible one. I can't trust them two. - Ed, I love you. Do you love me? - Hey, hey, hey. It's more complicated than that. It was never going to work. - Here we go again. Yeah, I'm so sorry, Jun. I'm just trying to be honest. - Okay stop it! - You know, it's just so impractical. Just give me some time, Jun. - Listen, I know you've had a rough night. - You know, I thought Caroline was an idiot for dating a scum bag like Steven but it turns out I've been screwing a scum bag for two and a half years now. Sorry. - Yeah. - What do you, what do you think? - What do you mean? - Do we have a future? - Jun I, I shouldn't live in a different country even if I wanted to. - Just answer the question. Please, Ed. If you're going to go back, then we should break up. Shouldn't we? - Yes, yeah. - Fine. - Uh, goodbye. (subtle music) (sobbing) - [Charlie] Ed? Ed, what are you doing here? - Nothing. You? - [Charlie] Well I, I'm just getting something for my stomach. Are you okay? Did things work out with Jun? - Um, no actually, Jun, Jun and I we're basically done. - [Charlie] Shit. Did I? - No, you didn't do anything man. - [Charlie] I'm sorry. - Fuck. - It's all right. - I guess uh, I guess single Ed had to make a glorious come back one day, right? Anyway, how's things going with with you and Laura? - Laura, hey! - Jun, I didn't know you were gonna be here. - [Ed] Charlie, Laura's here. - I can see that. - [Laura] Hey. - Hey. - Thanks for the invite. - Thanks for coming. - Do you maybe wanna go somewhere more private? I have something I need to talk to you about. - Sure, yeah, yeah, follow me. - You know how you were talking about boundaries earlier? Wondering if there'd be problems with us getting closer? - Right. - Well, I've been thinking you were kind of right. - Okay. - I broke up with Greg. - Wait, really? - I like you Charlie, I like you a lot. - I like you a lot too, Laura. - I'm really glad you're excited about all this. - Let's go join the party huh? Celebrate a bit. - Sure Charlie. But aren't you forgetting something? - Forgetting what? (subtle music) - [Jun] Let's get this party going! - Oh yes! - Like have you ever been to Paris, actually? - That's great! ♪ And I know that this might be an issue ♪ - [Jun] Oh my God! What the fuck, bitch? What did she even eat that was this color? Oh my God. Can we just like dry it a little bit? - I mean, maybe you got some seltzer. - Yeah, I think this shirt is just done for. You know what? I'm just, I'm just going to go home and change, so - Really? - Thank you, yeah. Thank you so much, thank you. - Yeah, of course. - I'm sorry. - [Charlie] Hey, how's it going? - Fan fucking tastic. - Yikes, first the thing with Ed and now this. What a day huh? - What thing with Ed? - Was she mad? - I don't know, she didn't say anything, but she stormed out so. - Shit. - Are you one of Charlie's friends? - And who are you? - I'm Laura. - Okay. - What? - I've just been looking forward to meeting you. - [Man] Dude, watch out what are you doing? - Whatever. - [Girl] Dude, I think that was mine. - [Man] I told you not to put it there. - I'll see you later. - And I'm like, where are the candles bro? I told Manny, I'm like, "Manny, you can't have a party and go like haunted with candles." - Hey. - Missed me? - Sure did. Hey, I really smell like vomit. Do you mind if I change? - Yeah, go for it. - It's just really gross. Laura, I just, I'm so sorry about all this. This is so ridiculous. You should be having fun, not cleaning up vomit. - You don't have to apologize, not to me. Trust me, compared to most of the dates I've been on this is an improvement. - What do you mean by that? - It got kinda heated breaking up with him today. He told me no one would ever love me. - Fuck Greg then, I love you. I mean, I love you as, as a person and, and who you are. You know what I mean? - I thought it was just some random girl from your Comparative Lit class? - No, not at all. Listen Laura, you ever find yourself with a bad guy? Well, life is just too short to spend on that bullshit. - Charlie, I love you too. - Sorry dude, but can you come clean the upstairs bedroom? Someone spilled a beer. - Christ, another mess. - Yeah. - I'll only be a minute, sorry. Steven. Why are you being so awful to Caroline? - God will you two just fucking stop talking about each other, man. Don't you have your own girl to screw it up with? - No, actually Laura and I are doing just fine., thanks. - Joy, have fun while it lasts. - What the fuck is that supposed to mean? - Dude, she started seeing you while dating another guy, right? So she's going to fucking start screwing the next guy while seeing you too. - No way in hell. Laura and I are doing great. We even just said, I love you. - And you call me manipulative huh? - Go fuck yourself. Steven, I know Caroline won't. - Caroline will come around. I'll be getting with her before you get with your little freshmen. - We'll see. - Hey. - Hey. - You know, I really appreciated what you said back there. - Before, I must have sounded like a total moron. - No you didn't. I wish more guys could be like that. Greg lied a lot. He um. - He what? - He cheated. - [Charlie] Cheated? I thought you two weren't exclusive. - Well, it was high school. He said that they didn't, you know, but they, they um. - I'm sorry. You know, you're really special to me and Greg, whatever he did. - I don't wanna talk about Greg. - But like, - I just, I just want to be here with you in this moment where everything feels safe. - Yeah? It sucks that we don't get to see each over break. What are we going to do? Like, I just don't know. - I wish it didn't have to be like that. - Me too. Maybe it doesn't. I love you. - I should check on the party. I don't want to, but I have to. - Okay. (subtle music) - Hey you. - Hey. - Tonight's been fun, right? - Yeah. - Party's really something huh? Considering all the mishaps. - Sure, but I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. - And you're happy with us, with where we're going? - Of course. - It's a good thing we did before winter break then. - What's with the questionnaire. - It's uh, nothing. It's nothing. - You've got something on your mind? - I guess it's just, we've moved forward a lot tonight. You know? Like we started as a little date and now we've I'm just wondering why a girl like you would be into a guy like me. - Should I not be? - No I, no I just, it's dumb. It's a dumb thought. - Well, Charlie you are smart, cute, honest and you know, I think we have something special. - We're in love, right? - Why is a guy like you into a girl like me? - Same. - You know, I promised myself the next guy I slept with would have to be someone really special. I needed you in my life tonight. - Yeah. Listen, do me a favor. Hang out for just a little bit, okay? I just need to check on the party. I will be right back. Okay. - Okay. - [Charlie] I don't know, I think I just screwed up. We just kind of just had sex. - What? - Yeah, I don't, I don't know. - Well, you're having a better night than I am. I don't wanna talk about it. - Well, I guess that means I should go in. - No. - Let's, let's take a picture. - Okay. - Okay. - Oh God. You made us look like a couple. - That's a really good picture of you, yeah. - Thank you. - No. - [Charlie] Wish me luck. - Hey. Sorry, I'm just texting my cousin. - Oh, that's fine. You guys close? - Yeah, you met her. - Oh right. What's your family like anyway? What do your mom and dad do? - I don't really know my dad. He left when I was pretty young. - [Charlie] Christ, that's gotta suck. - Were you telling your friend about me too? - She and I were just on the, actually we were, Christ, I should go check on that. - Leaving me again. - I'm sorry, I have guests. Steven's completely plastered, Ed's gone and that leaves me. - Love you, Charlie. - I'm sorry. - Charlie. - Oh, hey. - Mind if we talk? - [Caroline] Laura, I've been meaning to say this from the beginning, I think you are so pretty. - Get away from my boyfriend. Charlie. Let's go upstairs. - Charlie. - Charlie, what are you doing? - I don't know. I just, I have to. - It's only been one night. What does this say about the rest of our relationship? - I don't know. I don't know. - I'm going to be honest. We're not going to see each other for a whole month. You're out in California. So what are we going to do about it? - I'll figure it out. - Well, I guess like I said, I've always wanted to visit LA. - I live in San Francisco. You should know that. - You know, you're kind of acting like Greg, Charlie. - I never asked you to break up with him. - You said you loved me. You're not in love with me. - [Charlie] Laura. - Are you? You're just using me. - [Charlie] No, that's not true. - You know, I assume that you knew what you were doing. You said you loved me. - It's late and I am drunk and you are drunk. I'm sorry if I made you feel this way. - Why'd you have to fuck me Charlie? - [Caroline] Hey, hey buddy your little girlfriend left. - Stop calling me little buddy. - [Caroline] Okay, why? - Because I hate it. I've always hated. I just don't want to be talked down to like I'm a fucking preschool anymore, okay? - I'll just call you Charlie. - Caroline. - [Steven] Caroline? Okay, that's enough isn't it? - What I saw you with that other girl. Let me have my fun. Aren't those the terms of our not a relationship. - [Steven] Okay, don't harass the kid just cause you're mad at me. Leave him out of this. - I don't need you to defend me, Steven. I'm not going to be a part of this fucked up game anymore. - [Caroline] Charlie. - Fuck you. - [Ed] How are things with you and Laura? - She uh, it's a whole thing now. - Something wrong with the two of you? - Yeah. Got into a fight, very big one. - That's rough man. Sorry. - 'Cause guess what? Got in a huge fight with Caroline and Steven right after. So it's been a great night. - You uh, you and Laura then is it over? - I don't know. I wish I could go talk to her, but. - Well why don't you? - Why don't you talk to Jun? You've been together for two and a half years. - Okay, now listen to me. That is different. - How? You're supposed to get married. - Okay, listen. All right, I don't see trying to fix things with Laura. Hey, you can do it. (subtle music) - I have to go see her. - Good luck man, okay? (phone buzzing) - Charlie, what do you want? - Hey, thank you for coming down. I only have a few hours left before I need to go to my flight. - So? - [Charlie] So, I want to talk to you. To be honest, I don't have anything planned out, but I want to know what you want to do about all of this. - I just assumed you came here to fuck me again. - Laura, don't be ridiculous. - No, I believed it when I said I loved you, but I'm genuinely not sure what was worse tonight. The time you spent misleading me or the time you spent flirting with Caroline. - Laura, I was not flirting with Caroline. - Did you even consider my feelings? - Yes, I did. I never meant to hurt you. - Oh, so you love me? Do you love me Charlie? - Laura, I need to explain this to you because I want to be honest. I like you and I care about you and I care about our relationship and I think we have a great shot together, okay? And I was drunk before and I'm sorry. - You told me if I ever found myself with a bad guy, I should dump him. Do you still believe that? - Of course I do. - I don't want to see you when we get back from break. - No Laura. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Have you been to any good restaurants lately? - Nope, not really. - [Jun] Seen any good movies then? - No. - [Jun] Then I guess there's nothing else to talk about unless you want to talk about Steven. - Do you want to talk about Ed? - I guess that's good night then. (phone buzzing) - Are you going to answer that? (knocking) - Jun, I'm sorry. - Ed, it is so fucking late. How did you even get in the building? - I snuck in behind someone. - Oh my God Ed, then sneak back out. - I look, I think we can make it work. I want to make it work. - What about everything you said earlier? Different countries, your mother. - I realized I don't want to spend the rest of my life in Dublin with my mom. I would not have come here in the first place if that were the case. - Ed, I just don't think I can believe it. - [Faye] You know, some people are trying to sleep. - Faye, can you not? - [Faye] Just hurry it up. - Charlie? Hey Charlie, now's not a good time. Oh, Charlie, Charlie what? - [Charlie] I don't feel very good, I think I'm gonna puke. Can you come pick me up? - Okay Charlie, I'm kind of in the middle of something right now. Get a car. - [Charlie] I don't wanna puke in a taxi. - [Caroline] Here, let me talk to him. - [Ed] Okay, I'm gonna hand you over to Caroline. - [Caroline] Hey. - Okay, look I know that I messed up. I really know that. - Ed, it is time for you to leave. Get your phone and get out. - Jun please, I'm sorry. - Just leave Ed. - Can I keep this? I realize you're pretty special to me. - You really want to make this work? How are we ever going to be practical? - I'm still figuring that part out. - So what's going to be different this time around? - I wanted things to be different this time around. - [Jun] That's your answer? Come on, do better. - Do better. - Yeah. - Okay, okay, that's my answer. Okay. What do you want from me? Like I want to be open to trying new things, to being a little bit more impractical. Truth is, you opened me up and maybe I haven't always show my appreciation for that. So um, um, I don't, I don't know, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry. I love you. I'm sorry. I love you. I fucking love you. - You know, I still think you're a huge dumb ass. - So are you guys done or what?
