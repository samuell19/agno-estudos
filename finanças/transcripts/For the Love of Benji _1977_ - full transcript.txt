Vehicle 54, where are you? -Fifty-four speaking. -Come to Kalamia cafeteria. I will be there in five minutes. Lucky lotteries! Lottery! Hi, Stelios. Did you read today's papers? Not only those. The German, and the English. -You heard something, I guess. -Yes. Mr. Dietrich uses a messenger who has the coordinate code. He and the messenger will be arriving on the same flight. -He protects himself. They arrive at Heraklion tomorrow at 4:30. Who is the messenger? You have a photo. And as we do not have a lot of problems, the messenger is... a dog. His name is Benji. ♪ Your sunshine smiles ♪ ♪ Your skies are blue ♪ ♪ Your spring is blossoming ♪ ♪ And so are you ♪ ♪ You can turn me around ♪ ♪ Anytime I'm feeling down ♪ ♪ You can dry a tear ♪ ♪ Just by being near ♪ ♪ Your summer's song ♪ ♪ And morning's light ♪ ♪ Your dawn can overcome ♪ ♪ The darkest night ♪ ♪ You are the champagne ♪ ♪ For rhapsody ♪ ♪ Let your sunshine smiles ♪ ♪ On me ♪ ♪ Your sunshine smiles ♪ ♪ Your flower will sing ♪ ♪ Your ocean breeze is cool ♪ ♪ Your church bells ring ♪ ♪ You are the champagne ♪ ♪ For rhapsody ♪ ♪ Let your sunshine smiles ♪ ♪ On me ♪ As a matter of fact, I think we should probably move everybody over. Are you sure he'll be all right? He'll be just fine. And listen, my cat travels this way all the time. I hope so, because Tiffany hasn't been feeling too well lately. She has sort of a condition. Well, we'll take good care of her. I promise you that. But you only have three tickets here, I show a four reservation. Oh, well, Dr. Chapman isn't coming until next week. I did phone in and postpone that reservation. Uh, let me check, ma'am. Computers. We're going to Greece. -We're going to Greece. Yes, I know. You do? Well, it's the only place this flight goes. Oh. Excuse me. What day was Dr. Chapman's reservation? Um, Thursday. Thursday? I'll be right back, ma'am. It's not pounds, it's kilograms. There's over two pounds in each kilogram. Oh. Did you think Benji had lost weight? No, I was just joking, I knew it all the time. You did not. I did too. I'm sorry this is taking so long. Oh, that's all right. Where in Greece are you going? To Crete. Really? That's where we're going. Oh, well, it's a beautiful island. I've been there many times myself. I'll have to tell you some good places to go while you're there. Good. There's no need if we don't make the plane. Okay, ma'am, the doctor's reservation for next week is confirmed. Have a nice trip. Have a nice trip. Oh, thank you very much. Okay, kids, we're off to the land of Diogenes and Aristotle. What's an Aristotle? Aristotle is a who, not a what. I'm sure he's just joking. "I knew it all the time." Oh, sure. Hi there, Benji boy. This won't hurt a bit. Easy boy, easy, come on. Come on. See you in Crete. Oh, no, now you've done enough. No, no I insist on it. I know the place, too, believe me. Tonight you're gonna have the greatest food you've ever had in your life. Oh, do you believe that? Will it be Greek food? Very Greek. What's Greek food like? Well, it... Well, let's just say there's not going to be a lot of fried chicken. Hey, Mr. Dietrich, look. Can you believe that? You can't escape them anymore. Paul, Cindy. I'm Chandler Dietrich. This is for you. He said it is very important. Did he leave his name or anything? No. -Nothing. -Thank you very much. -You are welcome. Mr. Spyrou please report at the information office. Is anything wrong? Oh, no, I just have a phone call to make, that's all. I'll be back in a minute. Okay. Oh, listen, could you do me a favor? Of course. Keep an eye out for my luggage, will you? I have two bags, both of them blue, with a stripe down the side. Okay. Oh, and I'll tell you what, I'll get a cab for us. We can ride into town together. That way you won't have to worry about any language problem on the way. That's great, thank you. No, no. Thank you. Um, you are welcome. Mr. Papadimas is requested to report to Passport Control. Welcome to Greece, Mr. Dietrich. Do you have the coordinate code? Yes, I have it and it's in a safe place. Good. The map is in an envelope taped under the shelf below the phone. The project is getting out of hand, waste no time. Signal if you need help. We'll always be watching. I won't need any help and I don't like being watched. I'll handle this myself. Do you understand? Hello Well, where are they and why aren't they here? I'm sure they're all right. They must have missed the plane change in Athens. Now please, don't worry. I'll go call and find out for sure. And I promise you they'll get the best of care and be on the next flight. Well, please hurry. What is the next flight? Tomorrow morning. What's the matter? Benji and Tiffany didn't get here. What? Well, he seems to think they missed the plane change in Athens. But he's not sure? Well, he's gone to call. Well, why don't you let me check it for you, hmm? Don't forget to tell him they haven't had anything to eat or drink in almost 12 hours. And that Tiffany has a condition. Your attention please. The owner of vehicle with plate number 303383... Yes! I do not know. I just came. Wait. Ah. Hello, doggies. They are here. Two little dogs. Benji and Tiffany. Here you are. Some water for you. It is locked. And the other one. And now what? I have an idea. I know where I can find a big cutter. Do not go away. Fine. With this I will open your locks. You see. Piece of cake. Not again, this phone! It rings and it rings... Just wait. Yes. Do not send any more. I do not know where to put what I already have here. I will take everything out on the corridor. I have no space. Wait a moment. Shame on you. Now, be a good doggy and get back into your cage. Look what I've done, silly me. I say, is this the baggage storage area? Close the door! My word! -Hold it. It's him! Well, I must say, he's frightfully rude. No, you ninny, the dog, come on quickly, come on! Go away! The sausages! I will get you, dirty dog. I will make sausages of you. I'm almost positive it was him, but it all happened so fast I have no idea which way he went. Well, he's going to come and jump into your lap, so I suggest we keep on looking. Yes, dear. Are you in? Come. Come. Go away. Get out. The dirty dog. Look what he has done. Go, get out. I do not like telling you this, but you are smarter. Oh, do stop the Greek lessons. You know I can never understand a word of that gibberish. Too bad, I was commenting on your intelligence. Then I'm very glad I didn't understand it. On the contrary, occasionally you give birth to the most marvelously brilliant ideas. However simple. And although I hate to admit it, checking at the dog pound was one of them. I hope you realize I won't be the only one to think of it. And with all this interest around Benji, there's going to be a few visitors. I'm sure of it. It seems our hideaway scientist has become a very important man. And very valuable. Quite true. -Mmm-mmm. Not a thing. Not a thing. If only we knew where to look. I say, it's started already. You answer the door and I'll take our popular friend upstairs and take a few photographs out of the window. -Mmm-hmm. -Uh. Ah. Just give me a few moments to prepare and then get rid of them. I'm sorry, there must be a mistake. We haven't been there and we do not have a dog. Oh, this is your name and address? Yes, it is, but we do not have a dog. Never have had and we did not pick up a dog at the pound today. There is no way we would ever have a dog within 100 yards of us. I see, well maybe -your husband picked up the dog. My husband hates dogs. I see. I do not. Well, thank you very much. Don't you believe a word of it. You're welcome. Oh, good. Can I have a look at your face, please? Ah, thank you very much. Well, what do you think, Benji, old boy, is he really with Olympic? I wouldn't want to lay a bet on it. Oh, well, we have him nicely recorded. No, no, no, no, no, I'm afraid you've got to stay in here. There's a good boy. Here, here, we'll have none of that. No, bad dog. Now you might just as well make yourself comfortable. This is going to be your home for a while. Yes? How do you do? I'm here about the dog you picked up at the pound today. I'm sorry, that is somebody's mistake and I wish whoever it is would correct that. You're the second person to ask that question. Benji! Steady boy, steady. Just don't move. Good boy. Well, move it. Well, just... Ah! Where do you come from? Come here. Do not be afraid. I will not hurt you. Come. Are you hungry? Come. There you go. You were very hungry. You ate for four dogs. Now, roll and get some sleep. Right? This is Yiannis. Guess what I have in my kitchen? A dog. A rare dog. Yes, hurry up. I am waiting for you, bye. Benji. I know you're in here, Benji. Benji? Here, Benji. Here, Benji boy. Benji. Why are you afraid of me? Hmm? I never hurt you. Benji, Benji. Benji. Benji. Benji. Benji. Come on, Benji. Come on, boy. Benji, come on, boy. -Look! -No! Come. Thank you very much. At last. Get the things inside. Guests are passing by. Hey! Go away. Shoo! Go. Shoo, shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo, shoo! Ah, ah, ah, don't get up, gentlemen. Just stay put. I assume you know your identity's no longer a secret. Tell you what, give me the dog and I'll try to see that you come out of this alive. No, I'll take care of that myself. You gentlemen have a nice day. Go that way. Yiannis, get this. -Nothing. -Same here. I do not know. But he is trained. Yell. -Yell. Quickly, yell. Let him loose. Come quickly. Open the door. Stay! Benji! Look, Mary, it's Benji! Benji, Benji! It really is him! Oh, hi there, you little pumpkin! You can go. ...all over Athens and couldn't find him. I was scared we'd never even see him again. And guess who else is gonna be glad to see you. Okay, go on. You know, I think he's gonna-- Yes? Oh, I need to borrow your dog for a few days. I beg your pardon? I said I need to borrow your dog for a few days. Who are you Look, believe me, it's at least partially for the dog's own safety. He'll be returned unharmed in a day or two. Chandler! Why did you do that? Will you tell me what's going on here? Mary, it's okay, I promise you. Now don't worry, here. You take this gun, keep it on him and call the police, okay? No, it's not okay. I don't like guns and I don't know what this is all about. Well, I can't explain right now. I just can't, you're gonna have to trust me, that's all. Trust you for what? Well, I'm gonna have to take Benji for a couple of days. Why, what has he done? Cindy, he hasn't done anything, and I'm gonna take very good care of him, I promise you that. Well, if he hasn't done anything, why do you want to take him away? And why does this man want to take him? Mary, listen to me, all of you. I work for the United States government. And Benji is the key to a very important situation. Now it's my fault he's involved in all this and I'm sorry. I had no idea it was gonna become so complicated. But it has and that's all I can say right now. Does that mean Benji's a spy? No, he's not a spy, but he is very important to the United States. Hey, that's neat, he might become famous. This is not neat. No, Cindy, you're right. It's not neat. But he is important and necessary, okay? But what did he do, why is he necessary? Honey, I can't tell you that right now, but I'll explain it to you when I bring him back, okay? Hmm? Good girl. Mary, I'm sorry. Oh, that's okay, I guess. But you will take good care of him? I will and you better call the police right away. And if he wakes up, point that right at him. Come on, Benji. But I don't know anything about guns. The only thing you have to know is you point it at him and he won't bother you. Cindy, I think you'll be very proud of Benji and I'll see you in a few days, huh? Far out, Benji's a spy. He is not a spy. I bet that guy's a spy, too. -Mary! -Mary! You stay exactly where you are. Kids get behind the bed. Would you please send the police to room 701? Yes, I did, the police. Thank you. Where's the dog? The brown one. He's safely away from here. Is he with Chandler Dietrich? Is that who that was? That doesn't happen to be any of your business. I suppose he told you he was a United States agent? That's not your business, either. Yes, lady, it is. You see, Chandler Dietrich was found this morning at the bottom of a river in New Jersey. The man who was here is not Chandler Dietrich and he's not an agent for the United States government. Now will you please put down that gun so I can go after him? I suppose you're gonna tell me you are an agent. What else? I don't believe you. Well, we can wait for the police and wait 30 minutes for them to get here, another hour for them to check it out and by that time, your Dietrich impostor could be halfway to Saudi Arabia. Of course, it's not terribly important. I'm just trying to save the life of a top scientist, preserve a project of worldwide significance, no big deal. Well, say something! I don't know what to say! Okay. How about say goodbye to your dog? Because this man who has him, once he's through, he'll probably kill him. I can't believe that. Chandler is a very nice man. Lady, he's an international thief. He's a probable murderer and what your dog probably has tattooed somewhere on his body is worth nothing to him if anyone else gets their hands on it. Now, if he's killed a person, is he going to stop at a little brown dog? I'm sorry I had to say those things, but you won't be. Well, Benji boy, it looks like we made it, huh? Do you still plan to dispose of him? You see, the wife and I sort of like the little chap. What are you doing here? Well, to be frightfully honest, we thought it might have crossed your mind to, as you say, run out on us. Run out on you? There's nothing to run out on. You see you didn't complete your half of the bargain, you let him get away. Yes, of course, I suppose full value wasn't received, but all in all, a partnership's like a marriage, you know, for better or for worse. And we did expose ourselves to an enormous amount of risk. Yes, I suppose that's true. Still, if you would have delivered the goods... Uh, I do hope this isn't going to be a problem. No, of course, not. I suppose you do deserve something for your effort. Shall we try to hit on a compromise? Under the circumstances, I think those are very fair terms. I think it's quite honorable. Well, shall we have a drink then? Excellent idea. Come along, Elizabeth. Well, it's a pleasure doing business with you. My dear. Oh, by the way, you never said about the dog. Oh, he goes overboard, but then so do you. Benji! Benji! Call him again. Benji! Come here, Benji! So, anyway, Benji just happened to be going to the right place at the right time. For security reasons someone decided to let him carry the coordinate code for the secret meeting with the scientist. What's so important about the scientist? They think he's close to a formula that'll turn one barrel of oil into ten or twelve. And you can guess how many folks would like to get their hands on that. The whole thing sounds like a James Bond movie. Yeah, except in a movie I'd be Robert Redford and you'd be Genevieve Bujold. Anyway, it was a very simple and very clever plan, except the man we thought was Dietrich found out about it, eliminated the real Dietrich and took his place. He was gonna sell the scientist to the highest bidder. Would have worked too, if Benji hadn't missed that plane change in Athens. Hey, you're not living up to your part of the bargain! If I'm gonna talk, you've gotta pull. So talk. This person you thought was Dietrich, how did he find out about all this? Oh, I don't know, security leak somewhere, I guess. Happens all the time. By the way, how's Benji I don't think Benji's ever been better. ♪ I feel love ♪ ♪ All around ♪ ♪ I can feel it ♪ ♪ Shining down ♪ ♪ It lights ♪ ♪ Up the day ♪ ♪ Like the morning sun ♪ ♪ Reaching out ♪ ♪ And touching everyone ♪ ♪ I feel love ♪ ♪ All day long ♪ ♪ Like a promise ♪ ♪ Like a song ♪ ♪ And it's feeling good ♪ ♪ Like I knew it would ♪ ♪ Everywhere I go ♪
