so so [Music] my oh my god oh my god wow wow wow another fantastic performance i think everybody can agree on that one wow wow all right let's go i like it let's go for another one no i wouldn't say i'm comparable to quentin tarantino not yet anyway but i would very comfortably compare myself to the likes of wes anderson something funny david why do you feel you're awesome this one's level but not quinton tarantino's well it's all about the net worth isn't it david now i went on to google and according to has a net worth of 100 million dollars whilst wes anderson only has 30 mil now this being my directorial debut i mean of course i do believe it's going to make me 30 million or more but 100 million i think it's a bit unrealistic david i mean why do you think i'm getting you to shoot this behind the scenes documentary it's so when the film is released the world would know how jacob lewis made his first masterpiece and me being the businessman that i am as well once i release the documentary commercially i'll make millions of dollars of that why not billions of dollars why not the sky is the limit the blair beach project was made on a budget of twenty thousand dollars and we all know how much money that made no idea we'll have a guess just tell me how much money it made it made close to 250 million dollars so let me get this straight you're making a film exactly the same as the blair witch project and you're expecting to make just as much money yes okay let's set aside the stupidity in your logic for a second why aren't you making a film like paranormal activity which also made a lot of money paranormal activity david paranormal activity made 200 million dollars and trust me mate there's a lot i could do with that extra 50. so your film's title is the claire wizard thesis you know it is why well let's see i've replaced project for thesis just to up the stakes a little bit these students are making some shitty midgear project no this is their end of semester thesis and i've obviously replaced twitch for wizard because well everyone knows wizards are far more powerful witches what makes you think wizards are more powerful than witches well we saw harry potter together didn't we david i think you recall at the beginning of that film hagrid says to the main character you're a wizard harry he called harry a wizard because he's a male hermione's a witch and she's a badass are you seriously comparing hermione [ __ ] granger to the boy who lived plus claire's a girl's name claire the wizard yeah and blair's a guy's name still got caught a witch didn't he i'm [ __ ] with people right from the get-go just like the people who made the blair witch project oh how completely a witch i can clear be a wizard shut up david this morning one of our stars the young and handsome diego acosta has arrived on set after flying straight in from bordeaux in france ah good morning mr acosta stop right there look at me just as handsome as the photos put that down um come with me hey there quartz what are you doing on the film set hey david oh hi i'm claudia stewart and i'm doing makeup for the cast also my cute little cousin i'm not little anymore david i know i know i'm just teasing so how's doing makeup for the cast like it's amazing i'm so excited to be working with sophie anderson she doesn't even need makeup that girl's so perfect already i've loved her ever since i saw on home and away four years ago i haven't really heard of her before today has she done much aside from her way i don't think so well is she a good actor um let's find out shall we could you cry for me what i'm just filming a behind-the-scenes documentary for my little bro who's your little brother jacob the director oh yeah yeah so i just wanted to show the world what a great actor you are in this documentary sorry who are you again seriously i said sorry didn't i there are eight people on this set including you it can't be that hard to remember seven people um what's going on here is everything all right sophie david's not um bothering you you see a little what dave come here follow me i want you to shoot this documentary without upsetting [ __ ] talent okay this isn't this isn't today tonight we're not probing our actors on whether or not they can actually act so she can't actually act what is sophie anderson a good actor okay so now i'd like to obviously introduce the actors for the film um so first off we have the lovely sophie anderson what a comfortable what a comfortable squeeze and um moving on we have diego acosta great to have you on board diego and uh lastly young samuel weaver that's our final actor he's not your best mate no he's an actor yeah i'm not really an actor hey um jacob was like yeah i'm making a movie and i was like can i be in it and he's like you can taterly be in the movie g yeah oh that's how i got the power i think you want some weight man okay so diego you're walking in front of sophie all right she's gonna be holding the camera there we go and uh you're hearing noises hearing rustling in the bushes and you're scared you're very scared because you've constantly been hearing these noises in the forest okay and that's what i want you to stare at sophie so bright beautiful eyes and uh deliver the line that i've written for you understand do you understand okay all right all right good we're gonna go for a take ready for a take all right we're gonna go for a take everyone back away going for a take show me what you've got diego and action [Music] cut oh not meant to be giving us your blue steel here diego okay we're not making the next buddy zoolander i want you to be scared no scared scared do you understand what comprende on the scared comprende we sophie excellent no truly honestly remarkable with that camera if i could just uh come down for uh what's it up with me feel free to just you know check it out anymore you know just keep it shaky with it just shake it around check a little bit faster all right because remember we're showing the audience how scared you are how disoriented you are so just i don't know have fun with it all right let's go for another take okay remember here diego i want you to be scared mate just as scared as that [ __ ] photo was when he was trapped in shitlob's lair yeah maybe not maybe not that scared maybe not that's good all right let's do it scene 24 take two action [Music] we're losing light so probably just wrap it up rub it up there for now what about diego and his lack of acting ability do you think that might be a problem we'll fix it up in post can any of your actors act check excuse me i'm just asking a question for the documentary yeah well that's a stupid question david so how about you ask better questions okay why did you choose actors that can't actually act savvy hello i'm french model from france so you're french but your name sounds spanish owie my father is uh from spain my mother she's from france i love australia it is a beautiful country what made you get into acting diego i love the acting i'm very good at this i love it very much i love have you attended drama school before diego acosta pasta a name synonymous with success in the modeling world having previously modeled the likes of dolce gabbana calvin klein armani prada and being a regular on the front cover of vogue italia diego acosta bought the modeling world to its knees after he grew his hair long lost some weight had plastic surgery to completely alter his face and changed his height from 172 centimeters to 182 after leg extension surgery now following the likes of corey delevingne kate upton and jamie dornan diego costa is looking to get into the film industry well i've chosen diego acosta to be the eye candy of the film of course somebody for the females to look at and uh swoon over if you will he later acts as sophie anderson's love interest before he's very violently killed off do you think it matters that he's never been to drama school and can't act whatsoever so what do you think of diego acosta did you know i was among his first 10 000 followers on instagram you know i've even got a screenshot to prove it to you now he's got like a million what do you think of diego acosta i don't know he's good looking i guess i just need him to be able to act well though the character he's portraying was written to have a complex relationship with his father before the events occurring in the film diego just really needs to bring that out on screen i don't know as long as it's not as bad as wise does the room i'll be happy sure i don't actually think i've introduced myself by the way i'm david lewis i'm jacob's older brother i'm filming the behind the scenes documentary don't know you are did he mention me to you yeah yeah he filled me on and everything did he mention me to you by any chance no he didn't speaking of sophie i need to ask her about her thoughts on diego do you mind if we continue this a little later yeah yeah thanks yeah of course go ahead so i need to replace the batteries for this thing but i can't seem to find my spares anywhere has anyone seen video camera batteries around anyone oh yeah i've got some b-line batteries for you g what like video camera batteries yeah for this specific camera yeah why do you carry video camera batteries around with you a lot of people do anything but also because i stole the batteries at your bags i've been trying to sell them the red hot wait what yeah so i was wondering would you like to purchase these batteries for your video camera sir and we are back sophie anderson mr director oh my god your abs are so amazing diego you are amazing sophie i just wanted to tell you about before not to worry about my brother he's an idiot doesn't know anything about film you are an absolutely incredible actress yeah i'm sorry about before my little tantrum don't even apologize i'm the director yeah and i've actually decided i'm going to cast you in my next feature it's my lead actress i can't wait for that really no can i what can i just remember for next time gorgeous the wolf doesn't concern herself for the opinion of sheep right that little [ __ ] so it's the morning of the fifth day let's see what today holds action but does not understand me it's going to be okay we're all going to be there for you me us three young filmmakers and us strange isolated forests will stick together becoming even closer companions while documenting the clear wizard for our in the year thus us thank you samwell you know to say always what to say always cut why is diego shirtless in that scene well it's all part of his contract isn't it david you see for every 600 seconds of film diego has to take his shirt off i mean what's the point of hiring a guy with a good body if we're not going to show it off every 10 minutes now this is going to help with female investors female distributors and i guess female audiences in general i mean look at magic mike right that was a film about a bunch of shirtless guys and that went on to make around 25 times its budget i've worked out the formula you know get the women wet and you'll get millions of dollars any other silly questions david um do you think an australian audience would be able to relate to a film where two of the characters speak english and heavy accents what do you think an australian audience would be able to relate to a film where two of the characters speak english and heavy accents but i it it's really only diego with the accent isn't it [ __ ] you david i'm fighting against whitewashing in australian cinema that's what i'm doing samuel's still white i cast samuel in that role because he suits the character well okay he's not even acting he's being isn't he you see samuel's character is the proactive one out of the group kind of the group leader with a strong voice and a powerful stance on things in fact the only reason he dies before sophie in the film is because he saves her life yes an incredibly courageous act from a rather brave brave individual what the [ __ ] what the [ __ ] oh it's all buggers i think there's a bug on me oh it's just a leaf sammy hey where's sophie she's off this ridge uh no you're right uh lois i will check up on her lucy uh when ali shows us in um in a bit diego we'll just relax a bit mate we'll get there in a bit uh sophie are you in there love all right yeah i'm coming out now how are you take your time you're a superstar you deserve all the time you need of course there she is claudia this is sophie anderson of course she doesn't need a thing [Music] all right all right so we're going to uh move on from that scene i'm going to reveal that the rustling in the bushes that you heard before diego is just a passerby in the old forest and that's going to be this guy right here oh extra hi guys hello shut your mouth please all right any questions from my stars diego sophie anything that i need to we i'll do as a scene okay what do you mean by that i do the same as before no no we just i just said what we did you not hear what i just said uh compromise what the [ __ ] you saying i i do not understand english well does anybody understand was it french french on this set anybody i know quite a bit not you not a word out of you put your hand down does anybody else understand french i i know french not you diego i studied acting at screamwise i did some short courses at nighter too got involved in a theater production earlier this year actually i absolutely love singing musical theater is definitely a forte of mine would you like to hear me sing something that won't be necessary sing once really bad we don't need [Music] okay what would you say is your favorite thing about acting i i love getting into a character seeing the world through his eyes really morphing myself into him yeah what's your favorite aspect about acting um i think i'd have to be when the movie or show comes out and i get to watch myself and like see how good i look what do you love about acting oh we i love it so do you have a name jacob said i can't tell anybody my name why just so i don't make a connection with anyone and what's wrong with that well just in case i make a mistake or sophie wants to sleep with me and have nothing to do with me afterwards i can be replaced easier without anyone caring that's what jacob told me don't really think there's anyone to replace you man we'll just move on we'll move on everybody sophie now when i call action i want you to back right away from diego that's when the extra will emerge from the bushes and he will probably just wave at you maybe give you a little bit of a smile why wouldn't he be smiling at you right um and then we'll just shoot the rest of the scene i guess it's all pretty much very simple got it sir this is my first experience in a film and i really want to learn what the overall process is like who knows maybe in 10 years time as i'm working alongside some of the greatest actors currently in the industry i could be like started from the bottom now we're here who would you say is your favorite actor at the moment that's a tough one who would you say is your favorite actor myself duh who's your favorite actor mate oh old margot robbie she's a solid nine yeah she's mean ass babe that's a tough one what genre are we talking here all right and action did you ever sophie cut cut oh there you go please diego please okay you don't say anything in this scene nothing nothing did your sophie no you don't say okay well the line is did you hear that sophie okay and no you don't say it not now okay no say no no say no say zip it up lock it here it goes there no say okay this is scene 25 take two yep action sorry about the disturbance you folk have a good day now cut that cut what was that did you just try to uh snake in a line on me trying to raise your credit from an extra to a big part is that what that was oh sorry i just felt it'd be more natural if i were to say something after i frightened them and what would you know you're just the extra aren't you i wrote this film i spent six months working on it and i'm not gonna have it ruined by you you you nothing that's what you are you know that you're nothing you're a nobody do you get that i don't understand what don't you understand chill out a bit bro not now david this extra needs to learn his place now tell me what exactly don't you understand well i don't understand what my character's journey is here what is his motivation what well i'm walking past the three lead characters i i just want to know what my goal is like what was i doing in the woods in the first place was i collecting wood was i game hunting or was it something more sinister have i just killed somebody and dumped their body in the forest i just want to know more about my character does he have a family what's his temperament what are his hobbies and interests you are in this film for literally two seconds okay you have no character you have no motivation you have no journey and you certainly have no lines you're in and you're out okay now don't you try to pull a ricky gervais in the tv series extras on me do i look like ben stiller to you i'm jacob lewis i'm not the kind of director that will put up with those shenanigans or ricky gervais's shenanigans for that matter although i would say if ricky gervais was in my movie you'd probably get a line wouldn't he yeah i understand but it just doesn't seem okay stop just one let me just get this right is this some extra on a film set trying to give advice to a director to an author to an artiste am i getting that right no good good i don't want another word from you yes sir i'm going for another take sometimes you have to be tough on your cast and crew i mean as a director you have to be prepared to assert your authority on all matters you're a dick well i'm sure that's what they said about michael bay you're not michael bay that's right i'm not i'm jacob [ __ ] lewis i named you all bloody we'll remember you because [ __ ] is where i live you've been there i lived there oh true i was born there jealous when sophie talks to diego oh my god not at all can you imagine the children they'd have i'm sacrificing myself for the betterment of mankind you're so cute diego you desired no what are you talking to oh i'm just teaching diego some words in english and where's my little brother at um i think he's with samuel action hello there my name is lucy crew i'm part of the crew and i basically do everything jacob asked me to do so when i stand what should my stance be exactly why i uphold myself what's that a particular message to the audience am i bent over and submissive or do i stand straight and tall perhaps indicating an impression of power lucy could you uh take care of the extra point please i can't uh deal with him right now yeah thanks yeah so what would you say your practice like uh well personally i say he should be a little hunched over he's he's still a strong man but the world's definitely worn him down yeah that's really interesting okay okay so you're kind of the assistant director yeah yep that's me and runner producer sound person light person script editor production designer and i've done a first aid course too so i'm the medic too oh you're definitely doing your bit oh well you know i can only do my best my father bankrolled this film so i get my first soundy credit under feature production some people get bankrolled to be producers or directors but not me no no i'm soundy going through you know just holding that boom mic capturing clean crisp sound well it sounds like sound is something that's very important to you so how do you know my brother jacob oh i met him at my first year of film school he found my last name really funny so he kept in contact what's so funny about your last name we know i work in the crew and my last name's crew so he likes joking about that i brought the feed thanks lucy crew the crew members [Laughter] what are we laughing at so you and my brother get along yeah of course we do you don't find him you know a little bit of a prick no way no i love jacob he's got a thing for him don't you no no no i look i don't even know where you go look no uh i we definitely have as some sort of synergy but you know that's work chemistry work and play keep them i knew it oh can you please not tell him look he sees me as like a little pet not as a love interest i'm gonna tell him now jack got something to tell you man so we finally wrapped up filming for today very excited very happy with the progress i think uh we'll keep going at this rate and we'll be done by midday tomorrow when and where is the bus picking us up five five pm i taught him 3 30 we'll finalize everything that'll give us about an hour and a half to uh eat the food pack the gear up and as to where just by the tents how's he gonna get there well he has a map of the area david plus we're not too far from here he initially dropped us off are we good because i can't wait to get home well that's a shame because we're not going home are we david we still have filming to do in other locations and uh you know this [ __ ] that once we're done filming in the forest i'm done filming this [ __ ] there's already enough here for you to release commercially make your billions from it didn't you have something you wanted to tell me i need to chuck a leak a bit of taco gold right there jacob who's that what the [ __ ] is that who are you i'm sophie sophie who sophie anderson the actress you're not sophia i miss it as i just said i am no way look could you just do me a favor and not tell jacob that you've seen me like this you know without makeup no [ __ ] way could you please just stop recording me david jesus christ so now we head into our final day of filming in this particular location of course really really excited to be getting out of this jungle of course then we move into town interview some of the actors there about the the claire wizard and its sightings that's going to be fun you know david i think doing all of this especially as part of my directorial debut it's really going to attract the right reviews not just from reviewers also for my fellow creators i think i finally get to see my creative genius have mini glitter like how an explorer stumbles upon a diamond amongst these uh very puffy david david filter i think you would look really really good with the golden butterflies are you seriously looking at sophie anderson right now film the bloody interview mate what am i paying you for shut up jacob you're not even paying me samuel samuel i just want to ask you a question mate samuel can i ask you a question okay so would you say you've learned anything from this whole experience and another thing do you think acting something that you continue doing hey sami do you want me to go get the bomb gosh i love you semi-gay can i stop you stick again no one is stuck with duck at the same time so it appears that david my brother mind you has been quite fixated on sophie anderson today and yeah i told him i didn't think it would work out i just don't think we have the same spark we used to you know i mean he doesn't even like and comment on all my selfies on instagram anymore are you serious i can't [ __ ] believe he's doing this to me he should know that only i have permission to look at sophie me and no one else kind of glad he's leaving after today though we won't have to be there to see me getting with her probably start crying like a little baby i'd imagine probably be like i don't know [Music] [Music] me [Music] what are you doing lucy uh obviously i'm just uh recording some extra material for the documentary extra jazz for the audience to uh enjoy of course why don't you say hi lucy crew the crew member hey uh you do realize samuel and diego been waiting the past 30 minutes for you to film their scene together actually samuel's still high diego i think he still has that explosive diarrhea really it's just me waiting for you jacob well it's not all about you lucy yes i guess i'll uh return to my movie magic uh quite shortly but first why don't you say hi lucy crew the crew member as we near the end would you say you've learned anything from working with the director of the claire wizard thesis oh well even though i was barely involved i have to say i've received a wealth of experience it's one thing to go to a film school and learning your craft are you wasting valuable memory space interviewing the extra filming's finished david we're packing up so pack your [ __ ] up [ __ ] i hate you jacob did you say something david oh nothing just that i'm gonna stop recording now okay good a little [ __ ] we've been waiting for the bus for over an hour now an hour and 23 minutes to be exact if you want to come to my house and have like a kind of a bong and chill do either of you have a phone that hasn't run out of battery yet oh yeah i got one door but it ran out of signal away claudia don't ask me i ran out of battery now into the first day clauds what are you doing i should be liking instagram photos right now and you're sure the driver knows exactly where he's going to meet us give me that body hard he's got a map of the scenario plus they're not even moving that far from where he dropped himself in the first place what is his lord of the rings we'll shoot another two movies before he gets here then what the [ __ ] where is he so i'm guessing the bus driver isn't coming does anyone have a torch or something it's getting kind of scary i've got a torch still pretty dark in my end nobody wants to know about your end do you think he might have lost his map yeah probably why don't we go to the dirt road he dropped us off at and see if he's there cause david the dirt road's a bit far you said five minutes ago jacob that it wasn't oh did i yes you did well even if that is the case we don't have a map of the area though do we so i've got a map can anybody understand this map what what a [ __ ] map right now i'm just shooting your documentary hey guys i think we should probably get some rest uh if i ever wanted an extra to uh tell me what to do i'd oh wait i'd never want an extra to tell me what to do go stand over there go and stand over there jacob do you have a better suggestion for what we should do i think we set up the tents get some rest sort this out in the morning where is he diego what do you mean what do you mean mate you slept in the same tent as him and now he's gone okay so where is he has anyone seen my back i can't seem to find it i do not know where is he where is he that's where i'm asking you where is he not now lucy okay not now thank you what are you doing are you gonna help us find samuel you're gonna keep recording us i'm just doing the job you told me to do jacob yeah well it's not what i want you doing right now okay so okay we're lost to the forest samuel's missing turn off the camera thank you fine i will turn off the camera for now samuel daniel can you hear us oh my god i don't like this guy okay everybody stop stop i'm stopping me sophie and he's taking me for a second he not right now i don't want you to worry okay nothing bad's gonna happen to us we have each other you know nothing it's all that it's all that matters but we've got samuel we don't even know where we're going i would never let anything bad happen to you sophie anderson um because you know you're in my film and as the director i don't want anything bad to happen to any of my cast or crew but i am going to need you to help us to find samuel yeah do you think maybe i don't know you could call out to samuel forest samuel god it's a good girl samuel moving on it's really hard trying to help with the current situation we're in samuel without angering the director um what do you think you're doing this is a job for the crew what do you think by helping out behind the scenes i'd give you a bigger role in the film you listen to me you are just the extra what do you think you're doing it's planning for the cast and crew to piss on not for you to piss on you're just the extra it's a real shame by the way what do you think you're doing i don't want you breathing the same air as me do you understand do you want to know why you want more because you're just the extra could you slow down i just want to interview you not now all right i have time for your [ __ ] right now no surely there's always time for a quick intro you can use this material for the documentary the documentary my best mate has gone missing and we are lost in this forest so i'm sorry if i don't have time for the documentary one quick question what why don't you have to be such a massive dick to the extra you're not even filming anymore so hierarchy david i have to keep the hierarchy in place why why why are you still filming because i want to i want to film this [ __ ] you know what i don't want you to okay put the camera down and stop recording from now on good i didn't want to film anyway i never did okay you know what then keep recording i don't ever want you to stop filming you understand me awesome i actually want to record this [ __ ] to show the world what a [ __ ] idiot you are okay well i don't want the world to see that so let's put the camera away please thank you great just what i wanted all along you know what i don't want you to get what you want david so you keep recording you don't stop filming until there's no memory left on that card well that's just awesome isn't it i'm looking forward to it you little [ __ ] you remind me of david you mummy of danny mcbride in the 2013 comedy this is the end that's a euro mummy i know who that is i [ __ ] hate you damn little [ __ ] my shoe is for forest and is very fashion that's great to know diego what do you think about samuel and him not being here anymore uh i think very no good samuel no here would you say you're worried about the fact that we're lost in a forest no would you say you're ever worried about anything do you know what worried means diego what did i say about filming you didn't really make it clear oh seriously what are we going to spend the whole day waiting for you lucy sorry i'm sorry sorry jake i'm just i haven't even since 4 pm yesterday we finished we finished the water this morning so yes we're on the same boat yeah okay that doesn't give you an excuse if we wait every five minutes for you we're not gonna get anywhere today are we i'm trying yeah we'll try harder okay because unless you're i don't know will ferrell until a day good night getting his legs stabbed there are no excuses for slowing us down like this don't be so selfish all right we're good to go hurry up guys ah i'm not getting anywhere walked for i don't know closing an hour now doesn't seem like we're getting anywhere but surely if we keep going in the same direction we'll get somewhere promising that's what the people in the blair witch project said claudia and i don't know if you remember what happened to them but they ended up right back where they started and then they died they died claudia that's just a film if we do keep going in this direction it'll lead to somewhere promising i'm not risking a repeat of the player it's just a film we'll go back what yeah just go back the way we can so let me get this straight oh yeah let's let him get me finish you [ __ ] you're worried about returning to where we were before if we continue walking this direction yeah well if we go back won't we definitely return to the same place we were before i'm the director of this film and i say we go back to where we came and i'm just the guy with the common sense saying we should keep going in the way we're going he does have a point jacob shut up claudia just shut up you know what we'll do we'll put it to a vote all right anyone who wishes to side with the director of the film can raise their hands now diego raise your hand please diego hand we're raising our hands we're going back no diego no don't raise your hand don't listen to him diego raise your hand don't be stupid no one not raise your hand diego raise your hand oh never mind well looks like you may have wanted a line or two in my next film extra seriously probably not though i swear i've seen this tree before hey did we film at this spot before jacob jacob comes to find him in the forest he really just wants to know whatever you want a couple of waste jacobs meaning yes i know and doesn't this place look familiar he's alright i think yeah we've definitely been here before hey hey look don't be upset look it's not your fault yes it is lucy this is his fault i need water there's no water left i reckon we need to rest a bit jake jacob do you want to rest for a moment okay all right let's put our stuff down guys i've got to talk to you look all i'm saying is give him a break you know he's under a lot of stress the only reason you're defending him is because you like him the kid's a self-entitled prick who needs to grow up he'll break your heart without caring lucy maybe i like him okay but just look at him david look at how distraught he is do you feel sorry for your own little brother i'd feel sorry for him if i didn't already know how big a [ __ ] he is what are we gonna do i don't know it's clear we'll never see samuel ever again come on [Music] don't give up jacob plus i guess there's no point there's no point to any of this anymore lucy i feel like john malkovich when his son dies and demanding the iron mask i feel like how joel schumacher might feel if he ever had to work with valkyr again i feel like i feel like jacob lewis lost in the forest i just want to get out of here alive and update my facebook and my instagram and my twitter i haven't posted on them for days i might be losing followers i don't want to lose followers i want to gain them i see something important go ahead diego i feel it what i mean what the [ __ ] is he trying to say hey guys so we're going to set up camp here for the night what'd you look at everybody even when the times get rough lucy crew the crew member what are you laughing at so i don't know what's gonna happen we've been without food and water for more than a day now kind of craving a chocolate dick shake and burger or ten hey david yeah claude can i come in yeah of course i bought a torch i'm scared david i'm scared to close my eyes i'm scared to open them i'm especially scared to have my eyes like half open because you know that would combine the fear of both hey claude's easily bright better than i thought i would should probably get going i have something to say i don't even know if i want to be a makeup artist i was thinking maybe becoming a stylist i like style or maybe maybe becoming a talent scout seeing as i basically discovered diego i don't know i guess i'm saying this because this is it this is the end and i just want to be honest with everyone and myself yeah guys i don't think we're going to get out of here so i guess i'll be honest about something too jacob i've always liked you ever since we first met at film school i felt like we had a real connection i don't know i guess i never i never showed you because i didn't know how you'd react but how do you feel that was really sweet lucy but uh i mean let's not kid ourselves right i'm a film director i'm way out of your league i think if anyone on this set is going to get together it'd be probably me and sophie anderson yeah that's not gonna happen um i think diego is more my type what are we laughing at [ __ ] can everyone wait there for a second we'll see just don't tell me you told me so i wasn't gonna say that let's see okay maybe i was but i also wanted to say something else what my brother jacob he doesn't deserve someone like you he's a massive douchebag and you're actually a decent person david lucy always you two let's go just wait a second has anyone seen diego oh what not diego this can't seriously be happening now first samuel now diego who next diego yeah guys diego can you hear us are we where were you uh i was taking [ __ ] very big [ __ ] we're not getting anywhere what do you want david what do you want from me maybe try and check the map check the map oh yeah no worries i will i'll check the map now seriously i will stop right there david's little map this is the one you talking about obviously get the camera i want you to show everybody me checking the map there it is okay that's what i think of your useless shitty map oh my god you need to stop recording and help out some more do you understand really now they're having an argument you're the one who got us into this mess and do you even care you've been following us around this whole time recording us like this is some sort of joke to you you're a [ __ ] director what'd you call me you heard me no actually i didn't so you heard me jacob why on earth would you call me jacob lewis a [ __ ] director because you are and you're a [ __ ] person too sophie sophie we're all gonna die i want to be honest about something i don't actually look like this it's all makeup and a bunch of other stuff i did it to survive in a superficial industry this isn't who i truly am no i think i should show you guys oh [Music] you look like a completely different person well i just used a compression garment to to hide away my extra flab even your voice sounds different but but do you still want to be with me so so what do you still want to be with me jacob [ __ ] no you're ugly as [ __ ] i'd rather be with lucy crew than to be with you well maybe i don't want to be with you anymore jacob lucy what your brother's right you're a [ __ ] person and you're a [ __ ] director oh snap excuse me you heard me hi i see how it is we'll see you know when i'm making movies with the greats over in hollywood we'll see we'll see you two call me a [ __ ] director then oh was it a [ __ ] person as well huh yeah yeah we will i mean claudia are you deaf and dumb the [ __ ] do you think okay i feel like mel gibson in payback right now why you are stabbing me in the back like this this is totally uncalled for you want to know why jacob because you need to learn how to respect other people the world doesn't revolve around you i reckon babe is this even real those are some trendy shirts where have you even been probably [ __ ] [ __ ] hey that's my shirt that's also my shirt and they're barely putting in a pinky who is that guy oh this is ronnie we're just being here high and drunk and stuff you know afl's we have been scouring the entire forest looking for you no phones no water no food we almost died you know though oh chill out bros it's only gone all day where have you been sammy i just at the convenience store getting a feed and some soft drinks what there's a town yeah it's just around the block evening fellas lovely evening cheers well uh things did not go quite as planned for my first film so ever since i've been doing some research on other films to imitate and uh the brothers mcmullen by edward burns seems to be quite the option i mean while that film didn't make anywhere near as much money as the blue [ __ ] project i i do think a comedy drama will be easier for me to make seeing as i am not much people know this better quite the comedian myself plus 10 and a half million isn't a bad amount to make in the box office from a 25 000 budget nothing to write home about of course but uh yeah still still a fair sum now i was also thinking of uh starring in the film myself just as edward burns did it's me just uh taking a page from the book of the old burnsie what i call him sophie anderson won't be returning to the cast that's for sure but i didn't mind diego him and i could definitely play the mcmullen brothers as as could samuel as well the free mcmullen brothers yeah things are things are definitely looking up for me anyway now i think the uh main reason why the claire wizard didn't go to it's a plan exactly is because well not many people know this but i had to do most of the work behind the scenes a lot of responsibility fell on my shoulders and lucy crew well she's probably gonna need to be replaced or i'll pick up a game a bit i wouldn't mind that improve her attitude of course lucy crew not a professional that one i just feel like she didn't do enough you know i mean there's no two ways about it really and uh just because the film credits say one thing i mean doesn't necessarily make them correct everybody knows this well everybody in the industry will know this of course don't they hello hello is this the extra from the clearwizard thesis yes speaking hey hey this is martin goldstein from universal do you have a minute uh yeah sure well i watch the clear wizard thesis and i must say it's the worst film i've ever seen now i mean i was stabbing myself in the eyeballs that's how bad it was however in saying that you played your role of pacifying fathers perfectly you presented him to be a strong man yet still somehow showing that the world has won him down i really appreciate it i mean the whole audience appreciated it in fact it was the only piece of good acting throughout the entire film now i've watched a film with hugh jackman and he says there's a support role in his next project that you'd just be perfect for would you like to meet us in the producers in l.a sometime next week yeah that'll be perfect that's amazing that that's just amazing we'll book flights and accommodation for you as soon as possible
