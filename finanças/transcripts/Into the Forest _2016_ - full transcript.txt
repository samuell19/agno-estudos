You're not talking much today. Are you angry? You rather have me ask questions? Your mother told me you'll see your father on vacation. If I understand correctly you'll see him in Sweden with your brother. You are not mute, are you? Can you answer me speaking? It would be more enjoyable. Is it the first time you're going there? Yes. Are you happy to go? Have you ever been to Sweden? No, never, but I'd love to. I think it's beautiful. You're lucky. How long haven't you seen your father? One year. Are you happy to go see him? You can't really say. It has an upside and a downside, is that it? What's the downside? It's kind of scary. Tom ...? Remember that last year when your father came to Paris to see you, you told me the same thing? That you were afraid of how it was going to be. And later you told me you had a good time. You remember? Yes. But now it's with a little apprehension. What is apprehension? Apprehension is... when we are afraid something may happen that we don't want. Like a premonition? Not exactly. A premonition is more... when we know something is going to happen... even without knowing why, or wether you're certain. So it's more of a premonition. You're all right, boys? What are you doing? Are you filming me? - Did your mother give it to you? - It belongs to both of us. It's not a gift for me then? Give it to me. We'll film tonight. Not now. Wait. Don't get on my nerves. Give it to me! What kind of talk is that? Do you speak Swedish? Yes, a bit. Do you know how to say "hello"? No. But you can say "Hey!". Hey! And how do you say: "you're an asshole"? (in Swedish) Tom, put your things in my room. You'll sleep in my bed. - Where are you going to sleep? - Don't worry about me. Take it. Are they your children? Yes. The bigger is Benjamin... and the smaller is Tom. They are beautiful. How is it possible? With such a father? Their mother must be incredibly beautiful. What? She said she doesn't believe that you are my children, because I'm too ugly to have such beautiful children. - Hey! - Yeah. - I think so. - Yes? Yes. It's mom. - Hi, mom! - Hello, dear. - Hi, mom! - Was the plane nice? Yeah, it was cool. Great. What are you going to do tomorrow? - Did dad tell you? - No, we don't know yet. Well, you're going to walk, there are many things to see there. Will you tell me? I can film if you want. Good idea, my dear. We'll call again, okay? - Yeah. Kisses, mom. - Kisses from me too. We'll talk later. I'm glad you're here. We'll get along fine, the three of us. Can't you sleep? It's because of the full moon, it upsets you. I'm not upset. But that's why you can't sleep. You can't sleep either. That's true. It's because of the moon. Come here. Come here. I'll tell you a secret. But don't tell anyone. I never sleep. Never. I'm like that. I'm just thinking, I don't sleep. It's been a long time. Do you know you're lucky when you don't sleep? It lets you see things that others don't see. Do you understand? That's not possible. If we don't sleep, we'll die. Oh, yeah? Do you believe that? Am I dying? We can extract a lot of information about this mine from the subsurface. Hello. - Are these your sons? - Yes. Benjamin and Tom. This is Henrik, a colleague. Nice to meet you. "Enchant√©." What are you doing? They really shouldn't be here. You know that. I'm with them. It's the first time they come to see me. There are no exceptions. I'm just showing them around. I'm with them. Please, show them out. Tom. I want to go to the bathroom. Go ahead. Can you come with me? No. I don't know where it is. Neither do I. What are you doing? - Well? - I... Can I ask you a question? What? What's the question? Do you believe that the devil exists? - The devil? - Yes. No, he doesn't exist. Why are you asking? I told you he doesn't exist. If he really existed, would you be scared then? Of course. - I think I saw him. - The devil? Yes. Where? Where Dad works, in the bathroom. He had a cut on his face. Why do you think it's the devil? You don't know what the devil looks like. You saw a guy in the bathroom and thought it was the devil. I'm telling you, it was him. How do you know? I felt it. Did you tell dad? I think he knows him. Stop that bullshit. You're nuts. I went to work. I left 200 crown for lunch. Go to Mrs Bla's house. He left money. - What are you doing? - I'm snooping around. Look here. He could have left her in. It's disgusting. "It's disgusting." You sound like a baby. They haven't loved each other for a long time. Not before you were born. That's not true. Yes it's true. Ask him. Want to know a secret? The guy who picked us up at the airport... and who's living here... - He's not our father. - What? He looks like him, but it's not him. You're crazy. I'm telling you it's not him. - Then who is he? - I have no idea. A guy who took his place and acts like him. Don't you think? Just pay attention. His nose is crooked. Do you know who's got a crooked nose? It's the devil! - Didn't you go to work? - No. - Let's go. - Where to? We're going north. I want to show you an old house in the middle of the forest. - Serious? - That's what I tell you. I have some presents for you. One for you. And one for you. Do you have a coin? - Why? - It's tradition. When they give you a knife, you have to give something back. It is to not cut the friendship. We are not friends, we are family. Yes, but we shouldn't cut the ties. Take it. Give it to me. You too, Tom. Perfect. - Aren't you answering? - No. I don't care. It's from work. I have a question for you. Do you know which animal species, which if we join all the individuals of the species, would weigh more than all the other animals together? - The whales? - No. Whales are heavy, but there are not many. It's not the whale. Furthermore it's a terrestrial animal. I know! People. Nice try, but no. It's not men. - What do you think, Tom? - The elephants. Not either. You can add all human beings, all elephants and whales... chickens, cats, dogs, monkeys... all mammals and it's still not enough. - The cows? - Neither. It's an animal we don't see often. - You don't know? - No, what is it? The worms. They are 80% of the animal biomass. 80%. The remaining 20% are all the rest, you, me... the whales, the ants. All mammals. All the birds. Everything. There are two million per hectare. Every 20 years all the soil of a farm passes through their intestines. And we never mention them. Tom. Can I ask you to try to do something now? What? Just try, no problem if you can't, okay? What is it? Something simple. Look at your brother. And concentrate to make him turn towards us. Call him by thought, okay? Do it. Look at him, concentrate, and ask him in your mind to turn towards us. Go ahead. What? What did you say? Nothing. We didn't say anything. We're not at his house. We're in a hotel. Nothing. We'll leave the car in the morning to see the forest. I don't know, he didn't say. No, I don't know. Wait. Hello, mom. Yes. Yes. Yes. I know you're not sleeping, Tom. You're just like me. We're the same. Remember the game we did, with Ben and you? Four years ago, when we had lunch with your mother. It was about guessing what the other was thinking. Do you remember? Not very well. You guessed everything. It was unbelievable. Your mother told me to stop. She didn't like it. She was scared. Do you remember? I think you were too young. But you were already special. You have a gift, Tom. You know you're different, right? No, I don't know. You feel things. Things that are not completely normal. - Do you want to try it between us? - What? Influence each other's thoughts. No. Why? I'd rather not. That's too bad. - What are you doing? - We continue on foot. - Is there no signal here? - No! We don't need a signal. - I need the compass. - No, it will drain the battery. I recharge. - With what? - With the charger. You need electricity for that. - Is there no electricity there? - No. - Are you serious? - I'm telling you. - But... - But what? What if we get lost? You said yourself. We have no signal. Your phone is of no use. What if we want to take pictures? - Are we lost? - No. - You never use your cell phone? - No. - How do you know where to go? - Ben, enough. Take it. Let's sleep here. - Serious? - Yes. - Are we sleeping on the ground? - No. Unwrap your sleeping bag. You should have said it's that far away. Leave it. Hand me the flashlight. Tom! Are you okay? You want to rest for a while? No. All right. Come here. Come on. - Is it broken? - A bit. - We could take it to the lake. - Not now. First we need to fix it. Tom, do you want to take a picture? Give me the cell phone. - What's the pass code? - 2003. The year you were born. Everybody does it. You have a signal. I don't believe it! Look, there's one bar. I'll call Mama. - No. - Why? - Because. - We promised to call if we could. It's better to send a message, Come on, do as I say. Ah! Got it. Ready, sent. - Okay, now hang up. - Wait, she'll answer. Great! Hugs, son! Kisses, mommy. - Is that soup? - No. It's freeze-dried vegetable. I need to go to the bathroom. If you have to pee, go do it out there. It's not peeing. Then go where I showed you. Take this. - What? - He doesn't want to go alone. Is that true? Go ahead. Stop it! Give me some light. Give me some light. Ben? Ben? Are you coming? I don't want to. Why don't you? There's no lifevest. You don't need one to float. Come on now. Jump. Tom, are you coming or should I come get you? That's it. Don't make sudden moves. Easy. See? You're getting it. Sure, you're holding on. Nobody asked you anything. Go ahead. Don't be jealous. Don't move that abrupt. Easy. Go ahead. Now swim. I want to see you swim. Breathe calmly. Calm down. Go ahead. Go. It's going very well. That's it! If you could have anything you wanted, what would you ask for? I don't know. You spoke very fast. You answered without thinking. You should think about the question. Take the time to think it over. Only then you can start to answer. What in the world would you like to have the most? A Falcon. - A what? - A Falcon. A private jet. To go around the world when and how you want. In addition, having a Falcon means we would be rich. What about you, Tom? Friends. Friends? - Yeah. - There are a lot of friends. I don't have a lot. Not a lot, but you have several. It's not hard to find friends. - And you, what would you ask? - I ...? Eternal life. Or else this forest. That, this forest and the house. And you two with me. Here, forever. - How about that? - About what? If we'd live here, the three of us together. - In the house? - Yes. It's possible. We'd need to arrange it, but it's possible. Well... Thank you. What do you mean, thank you? Spending the holidays is alright, but then... Well... But? We would soon have nothing to do. In the middle of nowhere, okay. Go sit facing each other. Write a word here and don't show Tom. Will you show me? No, I don't want you to know. Then hide it well. Tom, you'll try to guess, okay? Close your eyes. - Are you ready, Tom? - Yes. Benjamin, think hard of the word you wrote. Tom, concentrate and try to see the word in your brother's head. Do you see something, Tom? Concentrate. Do you feel anything? I'm a bit scared. It's because you stand before the unknown. You will see the hidden word. Even if you're scared, go on. Focus your spirit on Ben and guess what he wrote. No. Go on. Go on, you can see. Go on! Don't give up, you can see. I felt something. - What? - An itch in the stomach. You'd never guess. Mouth. Are you trying to sneak up on me while I'm sleeping? So, what are you doing standing there? I heard noises. My impression is that there's less noise than yesterday, huh? Maybe you hear them better in the silence. It was a soul that fell. - How do you know? - I just know. When souls wander for a long time, they fall screaming. That's scary. Yes. Come here. You're afraid of the dark. Do you know why? Because there are things that hide in the dark. Animals? Yes, animals, but not just that. There are other things. Things we should not know. Things we don't understand. They hide in the corners, in the dark. And when there is no light and it gets dark... we discover that they are there. Everywhere. That's why we're afraid. You know what I'm talking about. Have you seen him again? See whom? The one you call the devil. Benjamin told me that you saw him. He said that you didn't want to tell me. What does he look like? Don't you want to tell me? Has he spoken to you? What did he tell you? Nothing. Are you sure? Tom. You have to see him again, you have to talk to him. It's very important. Okay? What are you doing? Look. - What's that? - Can't you see? What's that? Is that you? - How many? - A lot. The battery has run out. Damn. Why did he do it? Why did you film Tom? Now the battery ran out. - What are you talking about? - You know very well. No more phone, the battery is dead. When one has good manners you start by saying good morning. I promised I was going to call. What we will do in case of an emergency? I have my phone. Then give it to me. I'll call Mama. - Why? Is there an emergency? - You suck. Sorry? What did you say? - Nothing. - Apologize. - I didn't say anything. - Apologize, I said. It's you who sucks. You'll apologize. - I'm waiting! - Let me go! Yiou can do better. Stop it! You idiot! Leave me alone! Yiou can do better. I'm sorry. Shit! - Where were you? - At the lake. Come here. I said, come here. You sent some dirt to your mommy? No, it wasn't sent. You don't have the password to make the cell phone work. You should have tried before going and avoid the hike. Come on, give it to me. Why did you want to talk with your mother? Aren't you happy to be here, shit? Do you want the password? 9653. It doesn't match any date. With nothing at all. Don't you believe it? Look. There you go, call! Take a good look, because it's the last time you've seen it. What's the point of being here? We're leaving tomorrow and you'll take the plane. Ben? Ben? What? I need to go to the bathroom. Then go. Let me sleep. Didn't dad come back? I don't think so. Come and help me. Let's fix the boat so we can fish on the lake. - You said we were going home. - I've changed my mind, we'll stay. I was hot-headed, but now it'll be all right. I won't be mad anymore. - How long will we stay? - As long as needed. We want to go back to Paris. You can't keep us here. Of course I can. It's against the law. What do you know about law? I'm your father. I'm responsible for you. We'll leave when I decide. That's the law. This is bullshit. If mother knows that, you'll never see us again, understand? Really? Is that a threat? No. We don't want to see you anymore. Never again. Enough! I have never done you any harm. I couldn't. There's someone there. It's unbelievable to find a house here! Are you fixing it? I don't speak Swedish, Only a few words. No problem. This is your house? - Yes. - Very nice. Is it okay if we camp near the lake, does it bother you? No. - Where are you from? - France. Are those your sons? Yes. - Hello. - Bonjour. We'll be at the lake. I'm going to the camp. - Can I come with you? - No, stay here. - What are you doing here? - Nothing. We have visitors. A little voyeur. - Can I come with you? - He wants to see her breasts. I think so. I want to come with you. He wants to join us. I want to come with you. I think you're a bit too young for that. You're too small. - No, I'm not too small. - Yes, you are. Go back to your dad. Come on. Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry to bother you, but we noticed that you had a boat. Can we borrow that to explore the lake? The boat is under repair. It can't go in the water yet. - Let's wait... - We... Is that... You can not stay here forever. We don't intend to stay forever. I want you to leave today. Is there a problem? We asked you if we could stay and you said yes. I should have said no. Maybe it's because of him. Is it because of your son? What about my son? He came to us last night and I think we offended him a little. I came here to be with my children. Not to share the company of some hippies. - What were you doing there? - Nothing. What did you tell them? To get the hell out of here. Are you still angry? - Ben? - Yes. I'll kill him. Tom. Tom. Where is your brother? I don't know. Didn't he tell you where he was going? - Are you sure? - Yes. I'll go find him. Don't leave here. Got it? Yes. - Give me your shoes. - What? Give me your shoes. So I'll know that you won't go very far. Would you prefer me to lock you up? - No. - Then hand them over. Tom, don't worry, I got the phone. When I get signal I'll call mom. I'll see you. Kisses, Ben. Tom? Tom, let me in! I didn't find him. Put the shoes on. It's okay. - Are we going to look for Ben? - No. Let's go further ahead. - We can't leave Ben... - He left. Get out. There is another lake further on. Did you kill Ben? The important thing is that we're here together. What's wrong? It's my tongue. It's enormous, it's growing. Do you see anything? Are you sure? It's not big anymore? I don't think so. You know... I loved your mother very much. I really did. If I had been able... You look like her, it's incredible. Get out. I'll look on the other side, find another lake. Wait here. Wait! What are you going to do if I die? I'll die too. Why? Don't you want to be alone? Yes. No more friends. No. They're looking for us. Did you have a nightmare? Was it him? How many days can we go without eating? Long enough. Several days? Several weeks. And can you suddenly die? No. No more listening to the birds. Are we going to stay here? Yes. We shouldn't. Why? We should go. He's following us. I'm scared. You just have to hold out! - No. - Yes. You have to help me, Tom. That's why we're here. It is he who prevents me from sleeping. Keep circling. Don't be afraid. He swallows everything. Call him. He needs to stop. If you only knew what he does! Call him. Call him, please. Do it. Come on! Call him. Talk to him. Come on. Now's the time. Come on, Tom. Go ahead. Do it for me. Go! Go! Call him. Continue! Continue! Come on! Go, continue! Don't stop. Go on, Tom. Go. Is he here? Do you see him? Dad! Dad! Dad! Hello. Hello. Tom, can I ask you something? Yes. Do you think he's dead? Yes. You know, Tom, when you told me you saw the devil, I told you it was bullshit. But I think you were right. Maybe he really exists. I was wrong. It wasn't the devil. Oh, yeah? So who was it? Subtitles by Subransu Editing by Brunello
