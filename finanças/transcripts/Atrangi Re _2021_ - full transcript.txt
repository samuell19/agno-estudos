And, on top of that, they hate "Madrasis." - But why? - We're doctors, man. We should focus on dengue and malaria. Look at her. Does she look like she needs your help? What is she doing?

Or do you want to thrash me right away? So, Dablu? Did you find the boy she ran away with? How would we, Dulhayen? We haven't nabbed him in all these years, couldn't get him today as well. That rascal's a ghost! Not him, you're the bloody rascal! He is your brother-in-law! Doesn't my brother-in-law have a name? Why don't we get to see him? You've thrashed me so much over the years. If I didn't give you his name when I was a kid, what makes you think, I'll tell you now? If I run away with him another three times, I'll hit a quarter century! Tell me his name. Tell me! Tell me his name. Tell me his name! Tell me! Tell me! Tell me! - Amma! Amma! - Tell me! You'll get sick, Amma. - Calm down, Amma! - Call the doctor. You have two days. In two days, go find some guy, Gajender. Okay, Amma. I can't tolerate her antics anymore. We'll force him to marry this witch and get rid of her. Calm down. Relax. Careful. I don't care about his background. He shouldn't be from Bihar, got it? I don't want any more drama! Understood, Amma? We will find someone. I will start looking. Hey, come on. Found it? No, man. Search here. You'll get such a jolt, Vishu, you'll be stuck on this pole forever. Hey, I'm a Tamilian. We need to study to become doctors. Engineering comes naturally to us. The call went through! Hey, Mandy? Vishu! Vishu here! Where are you, Vishu? The engagement is in a week. Where are you? Hey, first ask me how I am. Hindi! We decided that you'll speak in Hindi. Er... damn! Ask me how I am first. - How are you? - I am wet. Wet! Totally drenched! Why are you getting us wet, bro? - When are you coming back, man? - Eat this. We're leaving for Chennai in two days. Don't worry. I'll be there on time. - Let it be. - Eat or you'll be hungry. If I reach dressed like this, I don't think your dad will let you marry me. But... hello... Hello? Hello. - Hello? - Time is up. Catch this. So scared of his girlfriend that he climbed up a pole for her? It's not easy having loving the dean's daughter, MS. He can extend my 5-year degree to eight years easily. It's wise to be scared. And Mandy's a good girl. Tell me something. Does Mandakini also confuse genders while speaking in Hindi? Because you do! Gender as in sex? Can I answer this after our wedding night? But, bro... I think you're hurrying into this. Genuinely... what is that? This guy. Go there and check. Aunty. This pudding was prepared for Mummy and Papa's death anniversary, right? Yes. Oh, the fire has gone out. Go, call Puttan. Puttan! Why did they have to die and leave me here, in this damned place? You are the ones who killed my parents. Now you pretend to pay your respects on their death anniversary. Bloody dogs! Don't get too smart with me, Rinku! I'm smart that's why I'm still alive. If I'd been a simple girl, you guys would've killed me by now. "Too smart." Hey, Sandeep. Switch the light off. - Sandeep! - Relax! I'm doing it. You just take care of the cops. I'll get everything else done. Okay? Don't forget I want laughing gas. - It will be arranged. - Make sure you do! Juttan! Come here. What's going on, Matadeen? What are these preparations for? Tell me. Cat got your tongue? You're getting married, my dear. Next time, you can elope from your in-laws' place. We've had enough of this drama. Had enough... Grandma... I beg you. Please don't do this to me. Think about yourselves. Why don't you understand? I'm too consumed by the fire of love. Touch me and you'll burn to ashes as well. You like to see me cry, don't you? Fine, I'll cry. I swear on my mother, you'll be the first one I smother to death. You'll struggle for a bit and then... it'll be over! You can hardly breathe anyway. And then, I'll chop the three of you and your families into pieces! And lastly the bridegroom. I'll strip him and thrash the hell out of him! Think you can give me away like a glass of water to just anyone? I'm like bloody acid. I swear I'll burn down your throats! Hey! What the... - She's crazy! - What... Fix it. - Yes. - Breathe... Fix the pipe. That bugger has pissed so much the whole place is flooded. Switch the light off. Switch it off! Switch it off! There... look, over there. Give me the torch. What torch, brother? You dimwit! Will you set off fireworks for light? Shut up, stupid fool! Let's go. The bridegroom is here. Come on. Get him out. Be careful. Carefully! He's our brother-in-law. Be careful. Bring him in. Carefully. Come here. He's here. Uncle... Quiet! What the hell! Who are you? Why have you kidnapped me? What do you want? I don't have any money. Who are you? What do you want? Why did you kidnap me? Let me go. What's going on? Will I be sacrificed in a ritual? I'm a journalist. If my friends find out, they'll come after you. Untie me! Untie me right now. Untie me now, come on. In all of India... couldn't you find someone who speaks the same language at least? We were actually aiming for someone else, but... it was so dark. We made a blunder... a bloody blunder! I had told you to get a torch, didn't I? - You fool... - Enough! He is an Indian. That's all that matters. Go, start the rituals. You look like a good person. Please untie me. Tell them to let me go. Please! What are you doing? - Will you kill me now? - Bring that cylinder here! Untie me. "Dinitrogen monoxide." Laughing gas! Hold him. Why is he so still? Is he dead? No, he's breathing. Still breathing. Did you steal my kidneys? What have you done? Attention all passengers, the train from Siwan to New Delhi will be departing from platform number 9 shortly. Stop this nonsense. Are you crazy? How long will you keep laughing? My life is so messed up, I swear! And this guy can't stop laughing. Listen to me, my name is Rinku Suryavanshi. I belong to Lord Rama's dynasty. We choose our husbands! I won't consider this forced wedding as marriage. You refuse to consider this as marriage? You don't approve of the marriage? - They forced me to marry... - Don't you dare swear at me! Two days... I'm getting engaged in two days. Was... will be... And then I'm getting married. Mandy will kill me. She doesn't listen anyway. Now all hell will break loose. Hey! Don't you swear! I am not swearing! I'm speaking in Tamil. You didn't want to get married, too? The hell no! Go away! How can I? The train is moving. Listen. Listen to me. Sit here. Sit down and relax. Please give him some water, mister, or he'll die laughing. Drink. Drink some water. What is your name? S. Venkatesh Vishwanath Iyer. O Lord Almighty! Do you have a simpler name for us mortals? Vishu. So, Vishu babu... forget about what happened. You didn't want to get married, neither did I. You have a fiancée, and I have a boyfriend of many years. Once we reach Delhi, we'll go our separate ways. Okay? Please sit comfortably, drink some water and continue laughing. DULHAPUR JN. Take this. Eat this; You must be hungry. No. I keep a fast on Mondays. Have been doing it since childhood. Does your fiancée keep a fast and pray for your well-being? Why not? She doesn't believe in all this. What is her name? Mandy. Is she a Christian? Mandakini... Hindu, Brahmin. Arranged marriage! Love. Love? How? She's my dean's daughter. Our families belong to the same village in Tamil Nadu. Met her in my first year of studying medicine. I liked her and she liked me. That's it. Rubbish! What a crappy love story! A love marriage with no one getting killed, families not turning into monsters, reputations not being ruined and no fights in the neighbourhood... is seen as an arranged marriage in our Bihar. Isn't this true? Correct! Oh... it's an arranged marriage in that case. Never thought about it like that. Let me tell you what love is. No one is as good-looking as you. I carry your photograph always. I'm a Hindu girl from a Thakur family. And he is a Muslim guy. Now this is a real love story! Be careful with this, Vishu babu. It's the first time I'm showing this to anyone. If you find another love story like ours, I swear I will be your slave. In the last 7 years, I've eloped with him 21 times, Vishu babu. Got caught every time! Got beaten up, thrashed. But you know what, I didn't tell anyone his name. I trust you, that's why I'm telling you this. What is his name?

Tell me... When will your boyfriend get here? He's in Africa right now to learn fancy magic tricks. He'll be back in a week or so. I see. Delhi. The air is suffocating; Everything else is great. Sit inside. So beautiful. So, what's up? What are you putting up? This is your noticeboard. - Ramcharan! - What notice? - Lend me Rs. 500. - Oh, brother! How are you, brother? You break the rules, I get blamed. Take this. - Get him! - Get him good! - Look, look, look! - Quiet, guys. Good morning, sir! You have a lot of clout here. Are you some leader? Senior. Vishu! Bro! Repair it properly. You better sweep the place properly. Go straight and turn left. The last room there. - You go; I'll be there. - Bro, you are just too much! Okay. Where were you? Your phone was switched off. Bro! Why haven't you called? Hey! Wait a minute... Stop! Stop! Listen to me, bro! Listen to me! What the... Wait! Just wait! Vishu. Vishu, listen... Ouch! That slipper hurt! Try to understand. I did search for you, man! You were nowhere to be found. We thought you'd left for Chennai for the engagement. We didn't go to the cops. No cops. But I'd asked around in the village. Hey... what's wrong? Why are you... You dog, I was forced into marriage! Forced to what? Marriage! Oh, shit! Vishu! Everything will be okay. Your fiancée is waiting with a ring in Chennai. Her magician boyfriend will be here when she calls him. Correct? He'll be here, won't he, Vishu? So, why don't you call him up? He's in Africa now to learn some fancy magic tricks. He'll be back in a week or so. That's what the girl said. The problem is solved then! Forget all this ever happened. - Nothing happened! - And what do I tell Mandy? Those guys were out to kidnap you, you rascal! First, decide what you're so angry about, dude. That you got married to her or because I didn't? - Hey, listen... - No, you listen! I'm a psychiatrist. I know women. There's no need to tell the Mandy anything. Did I just use wrong grammar? Oh, my god, my grammar... Her father will cancel mine degree, you dog! It's "my," not "mine." We'll behave very normally in Chennai. No one should know that this is Vishu's second marriage. Mandy should have no idea about our deep dark secret. We'll keep quiet. Stay silent. What's wrong? If I lose my degree, I'll chop off your hands and make you beg on the streets! And beg I will, bro, for sure. Listen, if breaking girls' hearts led to cancelling of degrees, this Dr. Madhusudan wouldn't have cleared high school. Come in. I didn't have a change of clothes, so I wore yours. You sit there... why... I'm going to Chennai with my friends tomorrow. For... my engagement. You can stay here for a while; It's not a problem. But you could come with us too, you know... That's also okay. If you'd rather stay here... Or you could come with us, you know. You can stay here or come with us, it's your wish. It's up to you... Here or... Yeah. What do you want? What do I want? It's up to you. Should I go? You decide. Should I not go? Up to you. Should I? - Should I? - Come, please come. Go to sleep. There are a lot of rooms here. I'll find one to sleep in. Good night. Vishu babu! I was a child when my parents were killed in front of my eyes. I've seen the greatest love story of Purvanchal burn to ashes. And that's when I lost all the good people in my life. After Papa and Sajjad, I found you. You're a good guy. So, all the best... for the rest of your life. I'll go to Tamil Nadu with you. I bet it'll be one hell of a trip. Oh, Vishu babu, so much drama? Someone will see us. So, now you're saying my lines as well? Why haven't you taken this off yet? You've put it on. You take it off. Um, that night... in the room... - I mean, outside... - You were dancing. No, I had actually stumbled. Really? Stumbling before the engagement, huh? Vishu babu... You'll make a good doctor. You don't get attached to your patients when you treat them. Vishu, come here quickly! This is too tight, Mother. I don't want such heavy jewellery. It's hurting me! Slowly. Give me a minute! I'm used to this. I'll... Careful! My lungi will come off, bro! Mandy is tying two garlands in her hair. I saw it. So? They're only 20 bucks each. Very cheap. No! It's not about being cheap or expensive. Then? I think I should tell her about Rinku. - What? If she finds out... - No, no! - She'll go crazy. - This nonsense again? Vishu, I'm a psychiatrist. I know women. It's easy to ask for forgiveness, difficult to ask for permission. Stop with this middle-class talk of honesty and truth! There's no need to tell her anything. Nothing! Get it? - Sure? - A 100 percent, bro! MS, this girl... Rinku... I'm telling you she's very dangerous. Really. There you are, darling! Please come here. Good lord! This is what happens when you get her to the engagement. Help me with the strap. Of my shoes. Please hold my purse. How do I look? - You too. - Ha! Thank you. Why the hell are you so nervous? I'm just teasing you. It's best... if you play along. Vishu babu...

Look at your son. Are you aware of what he has done? Mandy, please listen to me. He is married to that girl over there. And now he's pretending like nothing has happened and is enjoying her performance. It's not what you think! I'll explain everything... Don't talk anything! What? What happened? Daddy! What happened, my child? Vishu, what's going on? Mother, they kidnapped me. I was unconscious. Is this a joke? We can talk about this. How dare you! Listen to me, for god's sake! Move aside, Mother. We'll talk about it later. You've married that girl; Now you dare to bring her here? It's not what you think. Not what you think! I'll make sure you don't get your degree! Just get out of here. What on earth are you doing? I'm looking for my bangles, man. They were a gift from Sajjad. Even if they weren't, they're bloody expensive. By the way, this chaos over here is because of you, my dear. Make yourself scarce! Everything is over! What is left to discuss? What are you doing? Following your instructions. Hide! - Listen... - Hush! If this was Bihar, people would've showered me with money when I was dancing! So? At least give me an idli. I feel gassy! And sambhar? Messily flowing right in front of you. You don't even know what happened. Let me go! How dare you come into my house after what you've done! Get out! Get out now... Hey! Let go of her hand. It's okay, Vishu babu. Don't overreact. Let go of her hand. She will leave. Don't misbehave with her. We were forced to get married. But she is my wife. I made a mistake, Mandy. I should've told you, and I'm sorry for that. Are you waiting for them to call the police? Go and sit in the bus. And I'm sorry only for that, okay. Not for everything else that happened. Come on, Vishu babu. Why are you doing this? That old fogey would've let me go after a couple of slaps. I have a Ph.D. in getting beaten up. My grandma is way more dangerous than him. Sonakshi Sinha famously said she isn't afraid of getting slapped, but I'm not scared of kicks, punches, beatings... Shut up! Go and sit in the bus. You should treat all girls the way you treat your daughter. What did he just say? No idea.

I had no idea that things would blow up like this, I swear. - Are you very angry with me? - Very. What will you do now? I'll explain everything to Mandy that we were forced to get married, that you didn't even know me before then, that I'm in a relationship with someone else, that he'll come to take me away, and that I'll leave soon. Isn't that what we'd decided? That we'll reach Delhi and go our separate ways. And will this solve all our problems? Will it make everything the same as before? Won't it? When I have changed, how can everything be as it was before? I'm not upset that the wedding got called off. I'm angry because I'm not upset at all! Everything was going smoothly. Clear the medical exam at 24, become a doctor at 28. Get married at 32, buy a house at 35. Be a good son to my parents. Everything has suddenly changed. You have changed everything. I have never felt this way before like I do now. Never cried like a fool... like I'm crying now. You'll soon leave with your boyfriend. What will I do then? Thinking of this makes me upset. I shouldn't be upset, right? You get what I'm trying to tell you, don't you? Why did you have to come into my life, Rinku? Why? You belong to someone else, then why... I'm not angry that the wedding got called off. I'm falling for you. I don't know what to do, and this is driving me mad. Vishu babu... Sajjad is here. - What all did you learn in Africa? - Lots! Turning a dog into a man, a man into a pig, turning a pig into a fan... I can do whatever you ask me to. This hospital, those buildings, this Punjab Siwan Bank... I can make all this disappear in a matter of minutes. Rinku's boyfriend is here, MS. Go and say hello to him. No. Don't say hello. Say bye to him. Tell them that I'm in surgery, that's why I couldn't meet them. If they need any money for travel, give it. Just make sure both of them leave. And... MS, please don't make any mistakes this time. Okay? Also... nothing. Vishu... I've spent five years with you, bro. "I've fallen in love with you." I understand how that sounds in Tamil. Send me a message when they leave. What do you want to eat? I'll put it on Vishu's tab. You can eat anything you want. Should we get that expensive plate of chow mein? Even I was thinking of that! I knew it. Mister! Students, today we're going to learn about the cardiac system, and we need to focus over here. Dr. Vishwanath, you look pretty preoccupied. If you can't focus, forget it. Sorry, sir. I'm waiting for a message. Very sorry. Okay, the rest of you please focus over here. Madhu! Come join us. Delicious, isn't it? Chow mein? Pressure has to be regulated. We cannot either increase it or decrease it, okay? Please focus over here. So, what I was saying... Crazy bugger! So we need to see over here that... - What? - What happened? You've just been saved from complete organ failure. What's wrong? Where's Rinku? Rinku! She should've been in a museum in France, but she's roaming free on the streets of Delhi! What's wrong? Bro, I went to the canteen... Chow mein? When are you leaving? I'll just take my luggage from Vishu's room and leave. Meet Sajjad. Sajjad, this is Madhusudan, a close friend of Vishu's. He helped me a lot in Tamil Nadu. We were thinking of taking the train this evening. Vishu won't be able to meet us, will he? Guess he's very busy. I really wanted him to meet Sajjad. Should we wait for him? - Or will he take long? - Huh? Is he very busy? - Are you hungry? - No. - Waiter! - No, no, no... - Should I order some? - I don't want to eat. I'm good. Thank you. - We still have to pack! - Do you see a man sitting here? You have to help! No, sir. Please get me a milkshake. Sure, sir. - I was so hungry. - Sister. - Sister... - Hmm? Bro... there is no Sajjad! Vishu? Where is Rinku? I don't know. She might be in the canteen. Vishu, I can't run anymore! My scooter is parked downstairs. Remember the times of COVID, Vishu? When all we could do is stand in our balconies and clap. We used to imagine that superheroes would save us. We used to look for a saviour in our time of crisis. It's the same situation! In a time of crisis, Rinku made Sajjad up and believed that he would protect her. This syndrome is common among orphans. MS, I've seen Sajjad's photo. He didn't look like a superhero from any angle. He looked like a normal person. If it's all in her mind, from where did she get the photograph? In that case, who has she been eloping with? It's sunny today; I like it. She must've told you all about her and Sajjad's love story, right? - Yes. - Yes, she told me as well. And there's a small girl with her in that story, isn't it? Yes. My dear brother, she is that young girl. Then who is the woman in the story? And who is this Sajjad? That I don't know. But her story is real. That girl and Sajjad, both of them existed at some point, and Rinku is witness to their story. But right now she thinks this is her story and that Sajjad is a real person. In her mind, she has run away with him many times, but, in reality, she's been running away alone, every time! He could be anyone, Vishu. Her uncle or even a distant relative. Are you crazy? Who falls in love with their uncle? Hurry up. Here we are. - I know who this is. - Who? Who is it? The story she tells everyone is that of her parents. The girl is her mother, and Sajjad is her father. Father! Park the scooter and meet me inside. Jesus, Mother Mary and the Holy Ghost! ♪ This fragile heart of mine ♪ ♪ Overflows with thoughts of you ♪ ♪ And wells up in my eyes ♪ ♪ Like grains of sand ♪ ♪ Your fragrance Lingers on with me ♪ ♪ And the truth is ♪ - ♪ You stay on... ♪ - Vishu... Vishu! Over here! ♪ Like grains of sand ♪ Finally you're here. What brings you here? Rinku... you can't leave now. But why? Because... we aren't divorced yet! If you leave without getting a divorce, your family will throw me in prison. Yeah, they're quite capable of doing that. Now what? If we apply now, it should come through in 40-60 days. I'm okay with staying back, but he won't agree. - You can try and convince him. - Sure. Namaste, mister. Nice to meet you. What's wrong with you? Sajjad is sitting on the top berth, behind you. Behind me? Right. Namaste, mister. Nice to meet you. If both of you could kindly stay back for a few days, then I wouldn't land in jail. If I don't get the documentation done, they could accuse me of killing her and disposing of the body somewhere. They're bloody thugs after all. You're well aware. Yes, he's aware. It's great that he has agreed to stay. Wait, he hasn't agreed yet. Ask him to hurry up. The train will leave soon. Please agree. - He has agreed. - Great, he has agreed. - Let's go. - Yes. Is she alone? Is he with her? - Let's go to Kashmir. - Yes. - We can go boating on Dal Lake. - So he's here? Good. You know what, I've heard there's a vegetable market... - Er... - ...on the lake. Both of you please wait here for two minutes. - I'll need to go to the washroom. - Fine. Both of us want to eat; I'm very hungry. Okay. There is nobody. He is a dangerous boy! Why? Like the demon lord Raavan in Ramayana, he wants me to go after the golden deer. When I am after the deer, the coast becomes clear. And when the coast is clear, he will come and kidnap you and run away. No, no, no. He is a friend. Oh... there's no one! There's no one. Then you have made Raavan your best friend, my dear Rinku. But let me tell you... This villain will have to kill me before he can get to you. The united cities of Bihar know that. Sajjad Ali Khan is not one to give up without a fight. Rinku, my child, the Ramayana has just begun. To bring some excitement into your dull and boring lives... here I am! What on earth is going on here? They're all my patients. All cases of OCD, Alzheimer's, bipolar, schizophrenia. Even if anyone else can't, these people can surely see Sajjad. Give him a big hand! Now, the star of Bihar Sajjad will make this table float in air. Tell me. Did you notice why Sajjad appeared the moment you confessed your love to Rinku? Why? Guilt. It is Rinku's guilt that brings him back. So, guilt. Every time Rinku feels something for you, this so-called "Sajjad" will get jealous because Rinku will feel like she's betraying Sajjad by falling for you. So, how do we use this bit of knowledge? Look... no one understands mental disorders anyway. The poor girl kept running away from home, and they would keep bringing her back. Poor thing. Why don't we... Why don't we tell her there's no Sajjad? That only she can see him and no one else can. Fine, go tell her. Dude, she'll commit suicide! Don't you have any brains? If we tell her that what she has believed for the last 20 years isn't true, she'll die of shock. She needs to realise this herself. Do not force her. Let her take her own time. Do you want the girl or not? I do. We should start giving her medicines. Medical science is our last chance. In fact, your last chance, my friend. Rinku? I'm out here! MS, she's wearing my sweatshirt. So what? Good morning. How are you? Rinku, do you know that the Chinese are now eating mice? - Yes. - What? Yes, there's a new virus... - A new virus. - ...from China. But you needn't worry about that. Ask me why. - Why? - Why? Because we have the antidote! Right, we have the antidote. Give it to her now. You know, you should have it right away. Prevention is better than cure. What's this new virus now? This one is called... David. Covid... - Covid's brother David. - They're relatives. I don't see Sajjad around. He has gone to shower. Oh, there he is. He's here. Good morning. Showered so early in the morning? Why have they come here? I told you I don't want them coming here when I'm not around. Especially this bratty schoolboy. Why is he here? Sajjad! What Sajjad, huh? Sajjad, why are you sneezing so much? I don't know. I'm allergic to these two. Stop sneezing on me! Rinku... you look after Sajjad; We'll take your leave. - Let's go. - Yes. I don't like them. I'll slap you! They're ill-mannered, bloody scoundrels! Did you see? What? The moment Rinku had the medicine, the weirdo started sneezing. So? The better she gets the worse Sajjad will feel. Do you get it? I want the one behind it. No, that one. That one's raw, I want the one behind it. Rinku... - What? - Medicine. Yes. The virus has reached Ladakh now. Is Sajjad on the tree? - Can't you see him? - Of course I do! - Sajjad is on the tree. - Right. Sajjad! - Are you all right? - Did he fall from the tree? - Yes. - Are you hurt? Very good. Sajjad! What happened? Sajjad? Sajjad! It's been a month. When will she get better? Soon, bro. I'm a psychiatrist. You're a good-for-nothing psychiatrist! What? "Vishu, science is our last hope." Science is useless! I know it's not working out the way we... As soon as we give Rinku medicine, this guy starts coughing, sneezing and falling off trees! And then Rinku starts caring for him all the more. I saw... Which medicine will make her realise that Sajjad doesn't exist? Wait... you'll finish it. Don't drink from the bottle. See, there are many kinds of patients. Yeah right! And I landed up with the most difficult patient and the worst bloody doctor! - Who? Me? - Shut up! How am I the worst doctor? I'm trying to help you here. Hey, Vishu, wait! Listen to me, bro... Someone stop this guy. Come here. - Sajjad doesn't exist. I do. - Vishu. - I love you. - Bro... it's very delicate. - Sajjad doesn't exist. I do. - No. - Vishu, come back. I'm telling you... - Sajjad doesn't exist. I do! - ...there will be trouble. - I love you! Vishu, please listen to me. We'll get thrashed. You've brought a girl to a boys' hostel, for god's sake! - Rinku. - You should... Damn it! I love you. Rinku! What happened? Have you taken the medicine? Yes, I have. Have you been drinking? Little-little. Where is our dear friend? He's down with fever. He's sleeping. Oh! Fever! I'm a doctor; Let me check. The fever isn't high. He'll be fine. ♪ I'm so amazing ♪ ♪ You're oh so amazing ♪ She danced so closely with me... Marriage over! I said never mind.

Sajjad, I made a mistake. Listen to me. Where are you going? Sajjad! You saw that, didn't you? She kissed me! Did you see? Did you? MS, did you see? What? MS... that girl kissed me. - She's the one who kissed me, MS! - Kissed you? The medicine's working! She kissed me, MS. - Vishu! - Kissed you. See what he's doing, Vishu. Vishu! Come here quickly. She kissed you. - How did I miss this? - Sajjad! Sajjad, come down. What are you doing? Committing suicide! You haven't left me with any option. Nobody dare come up! Why are you so upset? I was a little drunk, and I kissed him. "And I kissed him?" Look at me! I travel around the world and meet so many women; Foreign, exotic women are my fans. Do I go around kissing them? Vishu, explain it to him! To whom? - Sajjad of course! - Oh, Sajjad... Sajjad, I'm sorry, please come down. He's just a friend. It was just a friendly kiss. - "A friendly kiss"? - "A friendly kiss"? Lord, why did I have to witness this? Save me from these people, these monsters... evil people! What are you waiting for, Vishu? Tell him we're just friends! I don't want to be your friend. Maybe we could've been friends when I was 20 or 21. But now, at this age, I want to be in love with a girl. See this? See! He wants to be in love! Do your parents know what you're up to in school? No interest in studies. He's just a quack, and he wants to compete with me, does he? Can he... can he can spit out fire? Like I can? Can he pull out a rabbit from his pocket? I can. Ask him to name one thing he can do that I can't. Ask him right now or I'll jump... No, wait! I'll ask him. Vishu... he wants to know if you can do anything that he can't. Tell me, Vishu! Yes. I'm not sure about what I can do... but I do know what he can't do. - Vishu. - Are you out of your mind? What are you doing, Vishu? Tell him to try and stop me. - What is wrong with you? - Hey! Stop it, Vishu. Stop! If Mandy's father finds out... Let go, Vishu. Hey! Vishu... Let's go back to the room. Have you lost your mind? - Someone take him to his room. - Vishu... Tell him to stop me if he can. Sajjad, come and stop him. - Vishu... - Vishu. Vishu, please don't do this. Vishu, please don't do this. No, Vishu, please! - Promise me you won't... - I promise. Promise. - Is he hurt? - Promise. Sajjad, tell him to stop! Tell him to stop me if he can. Vishu, why are you doing this? It's my fault. - Vishu, please... - Stupid fool! Sajjad! This will hurt tomorrow. Vishu... Get the first-aid box! - Vishu... - Take him to the emergency room! Vishu... - Call someone. - Hurry up! What happened last night? Nothing much. You just smashed 25 beer bottles on your head. Nothing much, apart from that. Vishu. And the loonies are back! Vishu. Are you crazy? Why would you do something like that last night? I've also messed up your life ever since I've arrived. Eat this. What happened last night wasn't right. I told Sajjad that Vishu is a very good boy and that he doesn't feel that way towards me. I'm the one who was drunk and got carried away. Let's forget about all that. Sajjad is here to apologise. Sajjad? Have you taken your medicine, Rinku? I forgot. I'll have it later. Sajjad! I'll be right there. Wait a minute. Come in. See, he has got a goat for you. A goat? Vishu, drink fresh goat milk and you'll be fine in a couple of days. Tell him Gandhi used to drink goat milk. Of course. So did I, every time I got thrashed by Grandma. Madhu, what are you waiting for? Take the goat from Sajjad and... tie it to this stand. Okay. You know how to milk it, right? Or should I teach you? I'll manage. These flowers are for you, mister. Sajjad. Sajjad! Okay! Okay... Yes, I should've stopped you last night, but I... I'm a little possessive about Rinku. We've been together for so long, so obviously I am. But Rinku told me you took such good care of her. You could've abandoned her at Siwan station, but you stayed with her... and didn't leave! You refused to leave! So, my gratitude... But kissing... - Sajjad. - No! - Kissing is banned. - Sajjad. Vishu, for all that you've done for Rinku... For that, I... no, we... we want to give you a gift. Vishu babu, drink this milk. Careful. - In front of them? - Oh, really! - So it's filled to the brim? - Right. How did you like the gift? Sure, I like it. Where is it? Where is what? The gift... Didn't you hear him? To thank you he said he'll make the Taj Mahal disappear in broad daylight. Agra? Three hours in a bus? Waste an entire day! Oh, what fun! Unbelievable, how 400 years ago this man blew up billions all for love! - Rinku. - Yes. Tell these guys to inform all the tourists, Magician Sajjad Ali Khan is about to perform! Yes, sir. Madhu, Vishu, gather everyone and tell them Sajjad will make the Taj Mahal disappear. Will all this vanish too? We'll pay you 500 bucks to stand there for ten minutes, please. It's only for ten minutes. All you have to do is clap. Aunty, please... stand there for ten minutes. - No, I don't want to. - Aunty, please... please. - Move aside. Let me click a photo. - Hear me out... As soon as we clap, you clap as well. Okay, fine. Follow my lead, clap when I start clapping. - I want to go to poop. - Please be quiet, child. Aunty, we're giving you 500 bucks for such a simple job... Get lost! My son wants to poop, and you're spouting bullshit! What's with the new stunt? What are we even doing here? We've come here to see a magic trick. Why have they got us here for the magic show? Not us. You! Basically, she wants Sajjad to like you and for you to like him, that you two become friends. Right? But why? What can that do? Because, then, she'll have both you and Sajjad. Bro... she wants two birds, one in bush and one in hand. She doesn't want to lose either of you. And, my dear friend, you're the bird in the bush right now. Sajjad's the one in hand! See... Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal. But it is Sajjad Ali Khan who will make it disappear. This extraordinary monument, which is a symbol of love, will vanish before your very eyes into thin air without a trace. But don't worry. Don't worry. It will reappear just as magically... because where else will lovers from all over the world go to renew their vows, isn't it? Please give a round of applause and welcome. Sajjad Ali Khan! Rinku, your medicine. Good job. Now, wait and watch. An emperor used his wealth to laugh at the love we paupers offer. But today, on behalf of all the poor lovers in India, I will make this monument disappear! Here we go. Praise the Lord! - Wow! I can't see it at all! - It just vanished! See... the Taj Mahal has indeed disappeared! It really has vanished! I've never seen anything like this. Brilliant! Look... the medicine is working. Vishu, the lawyer had called. The divorce papers are ready. Both of you can take a look... My hero failed. My father had failed. Will my hero fail as well? Vishu... Vishu, I know Sajjad's magic failed today. The Taj Mahal didn't disappear. I know. Then why was everyone clapping? I gave everyone 500 bucks. Told them to clap when they see the girl clapping. Why? Tell me why, Vishu. Because you're my wife! The divorce papers are yet to be signed, Rinku. We haven't signed them yet. And till you sign them, you're my wife! So, how is it possible that, when the wife claps, the husband doesn't? I will clap every time you clap... and make everyone clap as well. Vishu. Rinku... Rinku. Come down, Rinku! - Rinku! - What's wrong? Rinku! - Rinku? - What's wrong, Rinku? Rinku! Rinku, get here! - Rinku! - Be quiet, please. Rinku, get here! Be quiet. - Rinku, get here! - Please shut up! You've changed your hero, Rinku. My magic didn't fail. It's your belief in me that has failed. Nothing has changed, not you, not me... I can still make the clouds thunder when I snap my fingers. You're the one who doesn't see me anymore. You don't think of me anymore. Now that you've found that boy, you don't need me anymore. You want Vishu, not me. Where will I go if I can't stay in your thoughts, Rinku? I'll cease to exist if I can't stay with you! Sajjad! Sajjad! - What are you doing, Sajjad? - Let me go. - Drop the knife, Sajjad. - Leave me! Sajjad. Open your eyes, Sajjad. Where do I go, if I can't be in your thoughts? I've made a mistake, Sajjad. Let's talk. Where do I go if I can't be in your thoughts? Vishu! Somebody please help! Vishu! Sajjad, please. This is my fault. Sorry... Vishu! It's my fault, Sajjad. Please forgive me, Sajjad. Let's talk... I said I'm sorry. Open your eyes, Sajjad. Please don't leave me and go, Sajjad. Wake up, Sajjad... Please get up. Please save him, Vishu. Please save him. Vishu... I can't lose him... Please... I made a mistake. Vishu... Sorry, Sajjad. Please wake up. Vishu... I made a mistake... Sajjad, please open your eyes. Please save him, Vishu. Please... Please tell me he'll be fine. Sajjad... Please wake up, Sajjad. I made a mistake. Tell me he'll be okay, Vishu. - Let's end this matter now, Vishu. - Things will only get worse. Listen to me. Don't do this, Vishu. Tell her the truth. This will complicate things. Listen to what I'm saying, Vishu. What is it? This is a golden opportunity, Vishu. We'll stay inside for a couple of hours and then we'll tell her that Sajjad has died, that we couldn't save him! It's the correct thing to do, Vishu. Bro, this won't affect her psyche negatively. It's a natural death. She'll forget him in a couple of months. Vishu, please understand; This is our last chance.

Pigeons? - Rinku. - Yes. The divorce papers will be ready by 10 a.m. tomorrow. Sign them and... leave. Make three copies of each set. Keep them ready. Keep them ready. Doctor! Right after Dr. Dwivedi called, I submitted your application for fast-tracking. You know I'm well-connected here. This way. Get up, boy. Please sit, madam. Please sit. I'll mark my attendance and be right back. Please sit. My horoscope today says Saturn has overpowered Jupiter. I shouldn't sign any important papers today. I'm a staunch believer. Plus, it's Tuesday. We shouldn't sign important documents on Tuesdays. Really? Is it bad luck? Bad! It's very bad luck! I'm having a streak of bad luck anyway, madam. Doctor, please come here; You have to stand in queue. Oh, no the planets are not aligned favourably now. It's inauspicious to sign on any document before 5 p.m. today. It'll take only two minutes. My horoscope warned me against it, Vishu. It's not a good time to sign documents. Even you shouldn't sign on your patients' reports. They will die. Let them. Done. Please sign. Justice Tripathi, you look like you believe in astrology. Please tell me, when the planets are not aligned, we shouldn't sign any documents, right? That, too, on a Tuesday! It all depends on Jupiter, actually. Sign. Sign here. Sign. Move! Come with me and sign the papers. I will. Let go of my hand. I'll go with you. I will sign the document. I'll go with you. Let go of my hand. Please take me to IMS Hospital. Hurry up! What the... What do you want? Why don't you sign the divorce papers and leave? I don't want to! I like it when you say, "You're my wife." What about Sajjad? He's not my husband. But he's your lover, isn't he? Whatever! He keeps me happy. He's there whenever I call him. He leaves whenever I want him to. He gives me a lot of love, Vishu. He has never asked me for anything in return. His love is different from the other boys'. No one can compete with him. Exactly! He does exactly what the girl asks him to. Then go to him! But I like you as well. Does Sajjad know about this? Vishu... I don't know how, but he knows everything! - Really? - Yes. Isn't that amazing? So, you want a husband and a lover? What's the big deal if, in this entire country, just this once, a girl has a lover and a husband? Why did I have to end up with this very girl? Now that you have, it can't be helped! By the way, what's your problem? He hasn't ever touched me, Vishu. Neither have I! Go ahead. Have I stopped you? No. I'll get into trouble if I touch you. Then I'll spend the rest of my life competing with Sajjad. Then I'll have to suffer! Why will you suffer, Vishu? Both of you have very different roles. I'm getting off at the next junction. You go to the hostel and get ready. Divorce or no divorce, you're getting married today. - But, Vishu... - What did you say that day? "I'm the only wife who will dance at her husband's engagement." Now I'll be the only husband who will dance at his wife's wedding! Vishu! Vishu! Vishu! Come on, hurry up. Hurry up! Sajjad. Sajjad! Get up. Get up! Let's leave. Vishu has lost his mind. He was talking nonsense. He's saying he'll... Sajjad. Sajjad, are you seeing this? Sajjad? Are you out of your mind? Why dance in front of the horse when there's no groom sitting on it? Oh! Now you realise there's no one on the horse? And what about the entire movie that you've played out for us, which we can't even see? What are you talking about? Everyone is laughing at you. They've been laughing at me for a while now. You can see there's no one on the horse, right? Of course, everyone can see that! Go ahead and call Sajjad. Ask him to sit on the horse. And how do I do that? Everyone is on their own trip! No one bothers to listen to me. Rinku! ♪ You're oh so amazing ♪ ♪ And I'm so amazing ♪ What happened? Call Sajjad. Make him sit on the horse. Sajjad has left. Where? To Japan. Japan? This is a new one, MS. Sajjad has gone to Japan. Fine, let's go to Japan. Let's go to Japan. Japan? How? Just the way Sajjad has. Let's go. MS... How do we go to Japan? Airport? Not the airport, bro. The railway station is nearby. Sajjad will be wherever you want him to be. Perfect! It's almost 2:30 p.m. I'll wait for you right here till 5 p.m., Rinku. You can either make your lover your husband and leave, or come and make your husband your lover. Go. What if Sajjad isn't here? Huh? He'll be there. You'll find him sitting on the left bench on platform number 9. MS... What? Is there a sweet shop nearby? - Yes, there is. - And a clothes shop? New clothes and sweets? Sure. There are many shops. Come on. Come sit here. You know, your mother was braver than you. She wasn't scared of anyone. Not scared of the world or her family members. But you aren't as brave as her. You know, she climbed on to the back of an elephant and declared her love for me in front of the entire city! And you... You haven't even been able to tell me about your feelings! Do you recognise her? This is you. You were this age when you loved these candies. Then you grew up. You grew up and Siwan became too small for you. You wanted to run away with me every time, every day. But, my child, all I could offer you... were a few candies. I don't have much else to offer you. I'm leaving. You have found your partner. That rascal is brave enough to look after someone as crazy as you. Bye. Father. Yes, my child? When will you be back? I won't be back, my child. Why? The candies are over, my child. Please show me that magic trick, which you would show Mummy. Sure. Catch them! Don't let them escape! Sajjad! Sajjad! Move away. Mummy! Papa! Papa! Do I look okay? My wife is back. My wife is back. My wife is back. My wife is back. Is this a "friendly kiss"?
