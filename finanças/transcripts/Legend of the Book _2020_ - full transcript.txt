Mei'er? What is it? It's nothing. Master, we've been laying here for ages. My hands are cramping. What's poking me? Master, do you hear something strange? Growling... of my hungry stomach! That's not it. Come on. Master, you tricked me again. Hurry up! Fine. Golden Radiance Array! Demon, begone! Swift as imperial law! I'll hack you to death! Don't be afraid! Slay it! Master, I did a decent job, right? Just so-so. You still need more practice. [Legend of The Book] [Qingxin Temple] Senior brother! Senior brother! Step forward. I see, you have unsettled grievances. Who are you? Under the Nine Heavens, above the Nine Earths, the gods favor the dark feathers. Resentment gathers and comes to life. I'm called Jiuyou. The King of Demons. The King of Demons? You're a demon! What do you want? It's not what I want. It's what do you want? I am your innermost being. Dan Sheng is your target. Dan Sheng? You know everything? I'm omniscient, there's nothing I don't know. Go on your way. Go on your way. Kill Dan Sheng. Eat his heart. Only then, you can restore your human form forever. Go on your way. Go! You will even gain supreme divine power. That's what you've dreamed of. I ended up here because I tried to obtain the Book of Heaven. I'll strip you of your cultivation! You will never commit evil again! It starts with a birth. The Book of Heaven is in this heavenly fetus. Dan Sheng has the Book of Heaven. How am I supposed to defeat him? The Book of Heaven? The Book of Heaven has been sealed in Baiyun Cave. If you want to gain divine powers and kill Dan Sheng who ruined you, you should abide by my guidance. You're a demon! Why should I abide by you? Eat Dan Sheng's heart. You'll be killing two birds with one stone. It'll be great. I don't believe you. No. A demon. I am the demon in your heart. You'll come back. I'll be waiting for you. Come on. Submit to me. So, you've been driven here by humans. Be my followers. I'll help all of you! Mei'er! Be quiet. Master, what are you doing this time? Master! You're doing experiments on me again. What is it today? Be quiet. The water breathing technique. No wonder I couldn't breathe. I keep having nightmares recently. It's all your fault! It's not my fault. Who's fault is it then? Move aside. I'm going to take a bath. You... Nightmares? What are you doing? I'll help you grind them down. No, I don't bite. You don't bite, but others will assume that you do. Big Sister, there aren't any strangers here. Everyday, you refuse to let me leave the mountain. If I'm going to bite... I'll bite you. Naughty child. How dare you bite me. Tell me. Why did you get so serious? I better not tell you. I understand even without you telling me. You miss Mei'er, right? No way! I don't! What's the point of missing her? Mei'er is dead. I'm wondering why I always have the same nightmare. Mei'er wouldn't die so easily. I already resurrected her using the resurrection spell. What? Mei'er isn't dead? - Mei'er! - Can't you lower your voice? Don't scare the fish away. What's your issue? Why are you only telling me this now? Let's make this clear. I told you ages ago, but you refused to listen. Why are you blaming me? Master, I want to... Stop murmuring. You've been cultivating with me for years. You still can't let go of many mortal longings. You should leave. Master, are you abandoning me? I want you to gain experience on your own! - Okay! - Keep this in mind. You have to go to Qingxin Temple and uncover the reason for your nightmares. That's what really matters! Why Qingxin Temple? A few decades ago... No, centuries ago... I can't remember anymore! Anyway, look for Master Fangzhang Xuzhen. I'll go find Mei'er first then. Mei'er! Big Sister! Big Sister, did you hear someone calling my name? That was me. But... All right. Are you upset again? Do you want to leave the mountain and have fun? No. Then are you craving sugar figures? (T/N: type of traditional candy) Noâ€” A little. Goodness. We've been cultivating here for a long time. I understand your pain, but we still have to follow the path of cultivation. Big Sister, we've finished reading all our scriptures. I'll go to the temple and ask for more. Are you being serious? You're not lying to me? Big Sister, I'm not lying! Since you're going to ask for scriptures, make it a swift trip. Yes, Big Sister. "Karma comes and goes, karma gathers and disperses, karma arises, and karma falls and perishes. Laws originate from fate, all is fate." (T/N: Buddhist scriptures) I wonder if Dan Sheng and I are still fated to meet. It's another hallucination. Dan Sheng, it's really you. Mei'er, you're really alive. What took you so long? I thought you'd forgotten me long ago. How is that possible? I miss you all day and night! You're always on my mind! What brings you two benefactors here? Oh, there's someone here. Master, I'm looking for Master Xuzhen. You must be making a joke. Master Xuzhen is my ancestor. He has passed away long ago. Miss, are you here for scriptures? Yes, I've been here before. Please wait for a moment. [Cloud] The Book of Heaven. Oh no, someone has laid their hands on the Book of Heaven. Chu'er? So, you still remember me after so long. Are you trying to steal the Book of Heaven again? You won't succeed this time. That depends on if you can stop me. Muster! Summon! Attack! - Big Sister, are you okay? - Mei'er. Dan Sheng? Don't be afraid. Leave this to me. Enigmatic Four Fingers! Lightning troops! Swift as imperial law! Not you again, Dan Sheng! That's strange. I already stripped you of your divine powers. You shouldn't be able to take on human form. Cut the nonsense. Kill me if you want. You refuse to repent after your numerous sins. I can't let you off the hook again. He escaped. Dan Sheng, you're so impressive. I'm just so-so. Ever since I started cultivating with my master, I've been making progress every day. That's rare. Thank goodness you came in time. Chu'er almost got a hold of the Book of Heaven again. Gods, hear me! May the Book of Heaven return to its rightful place! Swift as imperial law! [Book of Heaven] I've used the Big Dipper technique to reinforce the Book of Heaven's seal. Even ten Chu'er's can't break it now. Chu'er. I ruined him. We're borrowing the Book of Heaven for our cultivation. Harming others will only foil your cultivation. You've resorted to wicked and harmful means just to obtain the Book of Heaven. Our ties end here. If I hadn't coveted the Book of Heaven, he wouldn't be so misguided now. Big Sister. Let's not talk about this. What's that? More Sanskrit writings. Big Sister, you must know what it says. This isn't scripture. It records a strange event. What is it? This is a detailed account of the Green Demon Lord's world. The Green Demon Lord's world? How is that possible? Is it another Book of Heaven that's existed since the start of time? There's another name mentioned here aside from the Green Demon Lord. The King of Demons. The King of Demons? Big Sister, what else does it say? The King of Demons is formed by the world's grievances. Once it has taken form, the world will be destroyed. What about the arrow pointing north? Does it mean that the King of Demons is north of us? That's not it. It means a nightmare point to the soul's abode. Nightmare? Mei'er. Actually, I came here because of a dream I had. A dream? In my dream, I... I had my heart ripped out. Could it be that nightmare? Are you trying to find an answer? I think I'm being guided in this direction. I'll come with you. No, who knows what dangers lie ahead! Letting you go alone is the greatest danger. In that case, Mei'er can go with you. Big Sister! Big Sister, you're so kind. You're always so bored here. I know what you want the best. - Long live Big Sister! - Long live Big Sister! But once we leave, what if Chu'er returns? Don't worry. He doesn't dare do anything to me. Dan Sheng, let's go into the town and eat candy figures. - Mei'er's favorite candy figures! - Yes! I also want to eat Wang Ji's stinky tofu, Grandma Cao's meat patties, thinly wrapped spring rolls, steamed buns, cured candied meat, and imperial scholar meatballs! Wow! What are all those? I've never heard of them. These are delicious snacks! - Mei'er, I'll take you to try them. - Okay. There's even honeyed crab paste, shrimp rolls, and wheat cakes! Okay, stop. My mouth is watering. One day, I'll take Mei'er to enjoy all the delicacies in the world! Okay! Why did you save me? I merely offered a little help. Do you need more? I'd love to have her aid. Go on. Go on! Kill Dan Sheng. Dig out his heart. [Lingtai Town] Come take a look. Come to have a look! Come look! Here! Come look! Smell this. It smells so good. This is pretty. [Snail Rice Noodles] Excuse me, please pay the bill. Give me a minute, sir. I'm not done eating. I'll pay you soon. - Okay. - I'll pay you soon. Mei'er, I think I forgot to bring money. Do you cultivators not bring money with you? Keep your voice down. I haven't touched money in a long while. Damn you! How dare you eat a free meal! Beat him! W-Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Beat him up! Run! Catch him! Don't run! Catch him! Over here! Mei'er, we're safe now. Where are we? - Excuse me. - Sorry, excuse me. [Hall of Dream Interpretations] Hall of Dream Interpretations? I heard the dream interpretation master has come. I want him to tell me about my love life. Ridiculous! The master interprets dreams! I think you should get him to cure your bad breath instead. Amitabha. Falsehoods and truth, deception and reality. Illusions are but a dream, intertwining the spurious with the genuine. I'm but a dream interpreter. Master, I always dream about Young Master Pan offering me peach blossom wine. Does that mean I'll have luck in love? Which Young Master Pan is this? The Young Master Pan who lives next door. Chubby benefactor, evil has pervaded your stomach, and you're greedy for food. It's time to lose weight. Master. I often dream of fighting with eight giant snakes. Does that mean I'm old but robust? Am I regaining my vigor? Oh, I know this. Evil has pervaded your kidneys, pushing you to the edge of an abyss. You should nourish yourself with snake testicles. This chubby benefactor is very wise. She speaks the truth. Useless woman, keep your mouth shut. What? You want to fight? How dare you hit me! I'll deal with you at home! Move it! [God] Master, we want to seek your advice. Master, I keep having the same nightmare. Give me your hand. Evil pervades your heart, liver, spleen, stomach, and kidneys. All your organs have been tainted. Master! Can I still be saved? Yes. I'll save you right now. Master, what are you doing? This demon has bewitched you. I'll get rid of her for you. Mei'er isn't a demon. Don't hurt her. Who ripped out your heart in your dream? It was... So what? She'd never hurt me. You aren't a mortal. How can you make such bold claims? I don't care! Mei'er is mine! No one can harm her! Parry! Dan Sheng! How is he so powerful? Five elements of the earth! Vanishing without a trace! Swift as imperial law! A master shall reveal the truth. The Big Dipper revolves, hastening travelers. Mei'er, that dream interpreter is full of nonsense. Don't trust him. Old monk, I'll be waiting for you. Should we go this way? Let's keep going north. Okay. Mei'er, I'm sorry. This is all we have to eat today. It's okay. But... What's this? It's grilled fish. No, we have to name it. - Mei'er's favorite grilled fish! - Mei'er's favorite grilled fish! It's a scratch I got last time from subduing a pig demon. It looks severe. Not at all. Look at this hand. What happened? Did you injure it too? This entire arm was eaten by the pig demon. This is a fake hand. Subduing demons is so dangerous. How dare you lie to me! I'll beat you to death! The pig demon is attacking me! Hey! Who are you calling a pig demon? I'll beat you to death! Stop! Stop! Don't run! - I'll beat you to death! - Stop! - How dare you spout nonsense! - The fish is burning! I'm the pig demon! Dan Sheng. Do you think demons are good or evil? Here's a question for you. Are humans good or evil? Humans can be good or evil. So, they're neither. What do you mean by neither? That means... they're both good and evil. Yeah, so there are also good demons and evil ones. Why are you asking about this? Because of who I am. I'm worried of getting you into trouble. Besides, your nightmare... I'm afraid. Why? That's impossible. Dreams are fake. In that case, we're the best of friends. Our friendship is everlasting. Dan Sheng, what's wrong? Hold on. I'll get some water. How ridiculous. How ridiculous. Chu'er. I can't believe you fell in love with a human. How presumptuous. Leave me alone. Humans and demons oppose each other. Dan Sheng will kill you sooner or later. Dan Sheng won't. There's no need for demons and humans to be enemies. You're the pitiful one. You're still defending a dead man. Dan Sheng! Dan Sheng! Dan Sheng! Dan Sheng! Wake up! Dan Sheng! Wake up! Demons like you can't tell good from evil and cause mayhem in the world! You must be eliminated! You crippled me and made me lose my divine powers! You made me do this! Enigmatic Four Fingers! Lightning troops! Swift as imperial law! So vile. I'll kill you guys! Let's go. Mei'er. Mei'er. Mei'er. Mei'er, you'll be fine. I'll save you. I've learned so many techniques, yet none of them are for saving others. Mei'er, I'll look for a doctor. Hang in there. [Lingtai Town] [Lingtai Town] Lingtai Town? This sun rises from this direction. North is just up ahead. That's strange. I kept going north. How am I back here? Why is it this place again? It's the same as my dream. Mei'er. You have to hang in there! I'll find a doctor right away! Where are they? A master shall reveal the truth. The Big Dipper revolves, hastening travelers. A master shall reveal the truth. The Big Dipper revolves, hastening travelers. Do these words mean... Was that dream interpreter Master Xuzhen? Qingxin Temple! That's right! If Master Xuzhen is alive, he can definitely save Mei'er. Whatever! Saving her is top priority! I told you to kill Dan Sheng! To kill Dan Sheng! I hate Dan Sheng to the bone. Why wouldn't I want to kill him? You should learn to take advantage of his weakness. Before I take shape, he must be eliminated! Eliminate him! I've been waiting for a long time. Are you Master Xuzhen? That's but an exaggerated title. Please save Mei'er! Mei'er. Dan Sheng. I won't save her. Just because she's a demon? Mei'er isn't a good demon. Stay away from Mei'er, and you'll be able to purge your inner demons. How do you know she isn't a good demon? Are all humans good? Are all demons evil? Everything has a destiny. If I kill you now, is that also destiny? This is precisely where your inner demons lie. Inner demons? I don't give a damn about inner demons! If you won't save Mei'er, I'll take her and leave! You won't save her, and you won't let me save her either. What kind of exalted master are you? Tonight, go to Zhenshen Tower between 11pm and 1am. Your troubles will be resolved. I knew a charitable man. He helped many people and gained a lot merit. But, he died in the streets due to a demon rampage. Dad! Dad! I also knew a demon slayer. He was bent on slaying demons. Yet, he ended up falling into the demonic path. All he wanted was his wife's forgiveness. I know a fox demon too. She's kind and selfless. She's dying, but no one is willing to save her. If all these are part of destiny, Buddha, can you give me the answers to my confusion? Why should humans be pitied, but demons are hated regardless of whether they are good or evil? If man is good, and demons are evil, shouldn't it be expected for demons to commit evil? Buddha says that the everything is illusory, and all is permissible. Aren't demons included in "everything" too? I believe in my determination. If everything is part of destiny, then me saving Mei'er is also destiny! Dan Sheng, let me resolve your confusion. I'm not confused. You can't tell right from wrong! You're the confused one! How rare. You're exceedingly perceptive. If Mei'er is my inner demon, then I'll willingly offer my heart to her. These stubborn persistences are your inner demons! There are only good and evil in this world. Nothing differentiates man from demons. Is that so? Yes! Indeed. These are my inner demons. Return. Dan Sheng, be wary of that master! Mei'er, are you fine now? Master Xuzhen saved me, but I noticed that this man isn't human. He's probably a demon too. Who are you? Dan Sheng, take another look at me. You're the source of the nightmare! Exactly. Who exactly are you? I am you. You are me. I was the Big Dipper God. I specialized in suppressing evil in the world. You're a god? Your insights have not let me down. You've passed the test and saved me. Test? You're the reincarnation of me. Jiuyou, the King of Demons needs to be sealed immediately. So, you were reincarnated into the mortal world and put through this trial. I'm the reincarnation of the Big Dipper God? Everything I've encountered was a trial? Yes. The King of Demons will be born soon. You have to do everything you can to save the world. Don't kill me... Don't kill me... It still isn't enough! It isn't enough! Dan Sheng. You can't stop me. You and I were born to destroy each other! Why do I have such a fate? I don't want to fight anyone. But, they're drawn to me. Dan Sheng. Why must I face this? I'm just an ordinary person. Why do I have to go through this? Mei'er, let's go. Screw the King of Demons and the Big Dipper God. Where are you going? My hatred will only dissipate when I kill you! Don't hurt him! Mei'er, stop. Look at who this is. Big Sister! Mei'er, don't worry about me. - Big Sister. - Mei'er. I'm only sparing you two because we used to be acquaintances. Don't force me. Wait! Dan Sheng. I know you're here for me. Since my existence infuriates you, I'm willing to sacrifice my life to save them. Dan Sheng! Dan Sheng! Mei'er, stay back! - Mei'er. - Mei'er! Dan Sheng! What's going on? What's going on? Dan Sheng! My dear disciple. Foolish disciple! What should I do? Jiuyou! I've killed Dan Sheng. I ate his heart. Why haven't my divine powers increased? Dan Sheng is the reincarnation of the Big Dipper God. Eating his heart means you'll lose all your divine powers. You lied to me. That's right. You're just my pawn. I thank you for eliminating Dan Sheng. You've been lying to me this whole time. You've been using me. Now that you've lost your divine powers, why aren't you pledging yourself to me? Dan Sheng is dead. No one can stop me now. You've overestimated yourself. It still isn't enough! The resentment isn't enough! Come here! All of you! It still isn't enough! I need more! It's time to exact vengeance on humanity! Go! All of you! Go! Come with me. Those humans you hate must die, all of them! Heavenly Goddess. Rejuvenate the body. Repair the soul. Restore the organs. Cleanse the body. Gods, hear me. Revered by all, radiating in the body. Exalted light shines in an instant, defending the true. Evil dissipates and the breath of life remains. The refuge of Buddhism showers blessings. Dan Sheng. You haven't taken me to savor the world's delicacies. How could you leave me behind? If you can't fulfill your promise to me, how can you seek refuge in the afterlife? Master. Can't you resurrect the dead? If you could save me, why can't you save Dan Sheng? His heart was stolen from him. No one can save him. Who are these yellow-haired demons? How dare you fool around here? If you want live, get lost. Get lost! Turning back means death too. We have no other choice. Exactly! Why insist on your misguided ways? I've cultivated for a thousand years. Yet, I still can't escape my karma. I'm born a demon, just like you. Your actions are just a meaningless struggle. You hate humans, just like humans hate us. Aren't the humans you harmed just as pitiful as we were? If I pity them, who's going to pity us? Exactly! Dan Sheng! He never thought of me as a demon. Dan Sheng firmly believed that only good and evil exist in this world. Nothing differentiates humans from demons. He is the Big Dipper God. I'm certain that he can save us. If you're willing to believe in the King of Demons, why won't you believe in him? But, he's dead. He's dead! No, he isn't dead. I can feel his breath. You're a god? I'm Yuan Gong, your master. Big Dipper technique! This book contains a way to bring the dead back to life. Do you know it or not? How intriguing! The wandering god rests, circulating his breath. Swift as imperial law! You and I were born to destroy each other! Enough with your nonsense! Anyone born because of you is cursed with horrible luck! Beckoning the gods! Bestow kindness on all! Swift as imperial law! I was born because of you. The more demons you kill, the stronger I become. Vile thing. The heavenly gods are present in me! Shine on the world! Swift as imperial law! Unchanging dark feathers. The king lives on. I shall return! Mei'er, I really don't want to be a god. Okay. If you have spare time, you can be a demon. I don't think I have time to do that. I was joking. I just want to live a simple life as Dan Sheng. Eating candy figures with you is enough. That isn't enough. Not at all. That's right. That isn't enough.
