What, did they say you'd never walk again or something? I was never much good at being told what I couldn't do. But I was in hospital for a year just flat on my back. I hate hospitals. My teammates would come and visit in the beginning, but after a while, I was just a reminder of what could happen to them. Bad fall, get hit in the wrong place, never play rugby again. Anyway, trekking around for a while just seemed like the best way back. You miss your mum. I can't find my way back. I went to the hospital to see her every day she was there. Almost two years. That's a long time. Not long enough. (SIGHS) Everyone was so nice, and understanding, and comforting, and... I just wanted to scream. Do it. Go on. Scream. Just do it. Look, I won't even listen. I won't listen. I can't. (LAUGHS) (RINGING) Come on, hit the ball. Cordelia! - What? - The ball. Take it! This is Cordelia. Hello? Hello? (SPECTATORS APPLAUDING) Who is this? Is it all right if I take her? I'd love to brush her down. - Really? - Yeah, I've got her. Odd. You've never been one to clear up after yourself. A new leaf, a new me. It appears you've made a friend. I know. Isn't she a beauty? Remember that darling pony you had as a girl? What was its name again? My childhood, please! You know I never look back. Oh, you remember the black one with the little white star on his forehead. Yes. Uh... The one with the star. I called him Blaze. Blaze? I really should get her back to the stables, so... The resemblance is astonishing. But Cordelia rides English saddle. And you, if I'm not mistaken, were taught to ride Western. Heaven forbid. I'm just a little out of practice, that's all. Well, this is a new low even for Cordelia. To hire a look-alike to stand in her stead at a charity event organized just for her while she's off partying. I don't know if it's the champagne or the sunlight that's got to you. Oh, I will call security immediately. No, you can't. The charity! Look, I promise you that I will do whatever is expected of Cordelia tomorrow. I'm not about to stand in the way of helping those kids. Are you? BERNARD: Alicia. No one must ever know. Is that clear? Crystal. Here you are. What a wonderful match. I was just congratulating Cordelia. The ambassador is ready for us. Oh. Shall we? If you muck this up, you will have me to answer to. Both of you. Pass it on. Oh. (SIGHS) Bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling, bling... Who are you hiding from? Hey. You ride very well. It's one of the two things my father taught me. And the other? (WHISTLES) (HORSES NEIGHING) (LAUGHING) It's actually more handy than you might think. (BLOWS) No, here. Put your fingers like this and now curl your tongue like that. Now you try. (SPUTTERING) (LAUGHING) That's terrible. Well, I'll work on it. I think you should. You're not what I expected. No? You're different. Different? Different is good. Is it? You make me think it is. You make me feel different. Sorry. Why? Mostly I always feel the same. Same people, same conversations, same parties. None of it means anything. But you help people. I mean, you're raising money, building schools. I wish I were part of something that important. But that's my father. That's not me. I do nothing. I've never been to those schools. I've never been to Africa, to Romania. I'm only faking my way through. GRACE: I know what that feels like. But there is nothing fake about you. I want to show you something. (MOUNTAIN AND THE SEA PLAYING) (SINGING) You call me a mountain And I call you the sea You can move me if you want to... Thank you. And then we're gonna go meet his friends and then we're gonna go dancing! Meg, what has gotten into you? I know. (SIGHS) I'm sorry. Me, too. Oh. (LAUGHS) Hey, mate. What? The necklace. There's the Meg that I know. What were you thinking? Stay classy, Meg. RILEY: You good? Yeah. I'm perfect. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) First class. (TAKE IT EASYPLAYING) (SINGING) Relax, take it easy For there is nothing that we can do Relax, take it easy Blame it on me or blame it on you Relax, take it easy (LAUGHING) (ALL CHATTERING IN FRENCH) Jerome. Merci. Excuse me. There are people for that. Yeah, I know. THEO: Give me your hand. GRACE: Thank you. Wow. THEO: I'm trying to impress you. GRACE: Mmm. So far, so good. When I was little, I had a snow globe of the Eiffel Tower, and when you wound it up it played La Vie En Rose. (LA VIE EN ROSEPLAYING) And when I shook it, the snow inside sparkled. (HUMMING) LOUIS ARMSTRONG: (SINGING) When you kiss me, heaven sighs It was magical. Just like this. I see la vie en rose Just wait. When you press me to your heart I'm in a world apart A world where roses bloom And when you speak Look at this one. Angels sing from above Everyday words seem to turn into love songs This is amazing! (LAUGHING) And life will always be La vie en rose I had a lovely time tonight. Me, too, Cordelia. Theo, I need to tell you something. - (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) - Yeah, sure, please. Hi, good evening. Maybe tomorrow. All right, then tomorrow. I'll see you at the auction, all right? Bonsoir. Bonsoir. (CHATTERING IN FRENCH ON TV) Emma? I'm in here. - GRACE: Hey. - Hey. Domenico? Mmm-hmm. What are you watching? Grace Kelly. (SIGHS) You know how on Hastings Avenue, how all the houses are set way back? With the front walks and big lawns and driveways. I always wondered about the kind of people that lived there. You know, the kind of people with the dimmer switches on their lights. I thought Owen and I were gonna live in a house like that one day. (SIGHS) It's crazy. It's not crazy. So stupid. I don't need a fancy house. I just need Owen. Grace, what if I blew it? Emma... Oh, hey. Hey, don't you worry about it. Okay? We'll work it out. We always do. I know. I know you will. Then what? I just... I finally meet a guy who likes me for me, and I'm not even me. But I feel like I am when I'm with him. If Theo finds out, he's gonna hate me. Grace, trust me. Once he knows the real you, the Grace that I know, he's just gonna know how lucky he is. You think? I knew it from the minute I laid eyes on you. (SIGHS) You're going places, kid. Wait. Where's Meg? Close your eyes. (LAUGHS) Do it. Where did you find that? For you. Hmm. Now, run. Hey! (PROTESTS IN FRENCH) (PRODDING IN FRENCH) - Bonjour. - Bonjour. (SIGHS) This is me. Back up to the old Grimaldi Suite. You're staying here? Yeah. Sort of an upgrade. Offer stands, Meg. It's not as posh as this. There's a place in Tuscany. You just pitch your tent right on the beach. And the company is good. I wish I could. The train leaves at noon if you change your mind. Change your mind. (SIGHS) Have a nice trip. You, too, Meg. GRACE: Meg? Meg? Hey! Where have you been? Will you relax? It's okay, she is right here. The article said millions, Emma. Yeah, I heard you the first hundred times. On my neck. I'm not going to relax until that thing is back in its case. What is going on with you two? Can you please just give her the necklace? What necklace? Oh! Riley! It's in his backpack. I put it in his backpack to be safe! GRACE: Backpack? Wait! Wait! What? Whose backpack? Riley's. Okay, so Riley has it. Where is he staying? He's not. He's gone. He stole the necklace? No, Emma, he didn't steal anything. He's getting on a train to Italy. Are you kidding me? At noon. How far is the train station from here? PHOTOGRAPHERS: Cordelia! Cordelia! Oh, hey, what's she doing here? Oh! Mademoiselle Scott. Room key. Faster. (KEYS RATTLING) Sorry. Pillow, there. Now the blankets. Nobody in Majorca knew... Cordelia? Right. Cordelia. (SIGHS) Hold on, Victoria. Yes? Good morning. Forgot how I hate the French. Do not even think about it. (SHRIEKS) Shanghai? Well, can you wait for me? I just have this tiresome auction I have to deal with. I suppose it... (INVITING IN FRENCH) Well, let's just... I was meant to have a suite. Put those in there. Wait. Wait. Stavros is supposed to be here, isn't he? I don't see his boat. He's in Mykonos. PORTER: Mademoiselle? Hold on. Yes? If you have finished, you may go. If you have finished, you may go. - Emma, go. - No, I can't move. - Move! - You have to go! Do it! Go. (EXHALING) Okay, okay. Oh, God. - Don't look down. - I'm sorry. I looked down. Okay. EMMA: I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe. Emma, stop it. It's over! Calm down. Shh! (RATTLING DOORS) It's locked. Come on. It's locked, too! Oh, no. No, no, no. Meg! Wait, no! Wait! No, no, no! Wait! No! No! - The train. - The necklace. Riley. Yes, I'm here, Mother. So unfair. I never get to see my friends. I never do what I want. When is it going to be my turn? Ugh! (SCREAMING) You know what? Let's just get on a train and go. I can't. I pretended to be that girl and now I lost her necklace. You didn't lose her necklace. I did. No, I did. Well, I lied to Theo, about everything. I have to go back. - What? - I have to fix this. Or at least try. Okay. Okay, we go back. We'll explain. Maybe she'll understand. Fat chance. Could you be a little positive? One night out and look at you. Cheers, mate. Excuse me, excuse me. I was wondering if you could tell me where the Grimaldi Suite is, please. - (PHONE RINGING) - Pardon. Hello? This is Cordelia Winthrop Scott. I've been robbed. Call the police. Robbed! I will call securit?. No, I said police! Call the police! Yes, securit?. No, I said police! Call the... Oh, forget it! I'll do it myself! Securit?. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Securit?. Mademoiselle Scott? GRACE: Hello, Francois. EMMA: Hi. You still need securit?? ALL: No, no, no. You're still robbed? No, no, no. - MEG: That's crazy. - Yeah! Police? I'm calling to report a robbery at the Hotel de Paris. This is Cordelia Winthrop Scott. Someone has been robbed? No, nobody. Theo! Nobody has been robbed. We're all right. But you... How are you? Are you teasing me? Teasing you? No. Well, because this feels like a game. (IN NORMAL VOICE) It's not a game. Not to me. But I do need to tell you something. And she will. Later. But the auction! Back in 10. Oh. I'll be right back. Okay? It starts in five minutes. Ladies, five minutes. (SPEAKING FRENCH) I don't understand women. RILEY: Perfectly good pear. (EXHALES) Grimaldi. (ELEVATOR BELL DINGS) Riley! Meg! The necklace! Do not touch that bell! (SPEAKING FRENCH) Bonjour. Hi. I need to find this girl. Have you seen her? Oui. You came back. I found your necklace. Thought it was a pretty good excuse for a second shot. Wait for me in the lobby. You got it. - Don't leave. - I'm not going anywhere. Pardon me. Hold on one second there, boss. You're telling me that Emma is staying here? I told you this. Mademoiselle Scott's friend. Now, pardon. Sorry, sorry, sorry. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (INQUIRING IN FRENCH) (DOORBELL CHIMING) Finally... We can explain. (SPEAKING FRENCH) (RESISTING IN FRENCH) - GRACE: Listen... - Save your sorries for the police. Wait, wait. The police? Oh, please! But it's right here. I have it. Exactly! You have it! MEG: Look, this wasn't planned. It's just a case of mistaken identity. It's impersonation and it's a crime, one I'm putting a stop to this instant. - But the auction... - Oh! Let me assure you that there will be no auction now. Hey! People are counting on her! (STAMMERING) Or on you... What? That's not my problem. Don't touch the phone. Or what? I promise you it is a false alarm. She said everything was fine. Quoi? (SPEAKING FRENCH) But why am I speaking English? CORDELIA: No! You let me up. Now what do we do? - Cordelia? - RECEPTIONIST: Mademoiselle? Help! Mmm! (SQUEALING) Mademoiselle, open the door! GRACE: Just a minute. Give me the... (SPEAKING FRENCH) Bonjour. - Hello. - Hi. Mademoiselle. Excusez-moi. We had a call. There was a robbery? Oh, no. A misunderstanding. You see? MEG: Yes, she couldn't find her necklace. What? Where is she? I'm right here. RECEPTIONIST: There she is. Bonjour, mademoiselle. Bonjour. Theo, could you help me? I can't quite manage the clasp. But tell me, we heard a scream. Oh! When she found the necklace, right now, she was so, so happy. (WHISPERING) What's going on here? Relieved. Oh, really? Yes, I'm very sorry to have wasted your time. Well, allow me to escort you, mademoiselle, you know, as a precaution. Would you? I'm afraid I'm already late. Right, Theo? Theo? Coming, Meg? Yes. Right behind you. (RECEPTIONIST THANKING IN FRENCH) How's it going in here? Oh, we're good. Just getting acquainted. We will... We'll let you go as soon as the auction is over. Be right back. MEG: Oh, come on. Come on. (WHISPERING) Promise that whatever happens, you'll think of the girl you showed the fireworks to. That was me. Grace? Meg! Owen! What are you doing here? What's with... Where's Emma? She's upstairs. Meg, is everything all right? Yeah, everything's fine. Where upstairs? Trust me, you don't want to go up there. - (IN ENGLISH ACCENT) Meg? - Yes? - Are you coming? - Coming. Why is she talking like that? (GROANS) She's not. Please, both of you, just stay here. Hey, mate. Third floor. Grimaldi Suite. What did you tell him? It's fine, he's waiting with Riley. BERNARD: (ANNOUNCING) Miss Cordelia Winthrop Scott. We've got this. I'm really glad you came, Meg. I wouldn't miss this for the world. (APPLAUSE) You will never get away with this. Honey, we've been getting away with this for days. (DOORBELL CHIMING) You... What? Don't mess with Texas. (EXCLAIMS) Emma. Owen? - What are you... - What are you doing here? (STAMMERING) What am I doing here? What am I doing here? I've been running all over Paris looking for you. Hi. Hi. BERNARD: 1,000,000 euros. 1,500,000. We have a bid for 1.5. 1,700,000. Marvelous! 1,700,000. Do I hear two? You went all the way to Paris for me? I don't want to lose you, Emma. Maybe I was trying to fence you in a bit. Guess I was just worried that once you saw everything there was to see here, you wouldn't come back. Owen... And look, I'm sorry for that, because I don't ever want to keep you from something better. Emma, you deserve the best. But I already have the best. Yeah? Yeah. (THUD) What was that? (GRUNTING) So, Paris. It's pretty awesome, right? What was that? - What was what, honey? - You heard it. - No, I didn't. - Is someone in there? What? Is someone in here? No. Emma, what's going on? Oh, shoot. OWEN: Grace? (LOUD APPLAUSE) BERNARD: We have a bid for 2.5. Who will bid 3,000,000 euros? Anyone? (IN NORMAL VOICE) It's too much. Mesdames et messieurs, who will take us to 3,000,000? Can I have... Please, I'm sorry. But, my dear, what is wrong? It's okay. There's something I need to say. Of course. What is it, Cordelia? Gandhi once said... Gandhi? ...that you must be the change you wish to see. This necklace isn't mine. (ALL MURMURING) CORDELIA: No, it's mine. Arrest her, she's an imposter. Arrest her. It's true. I'm not Cordelia Scott. There, you see? I'm just a regular girl from Texas. I'm no one special, but I had the chance to be, even if it was only for a minute, and I took it. We all did. And we're sorry. I know what I did was wrong and I don't expect you to forgive me. But it wasn't all a lie. I thought you were different. - $3,000,000. - (ALL GASP) Owen. We're from Texas, we go big. He doesn't have any money. Look at them, none of them do. - Arrest them. - It's okay. I'm sorry, I didn't mean... Look, you all came here to help those kids. Please don't let my mistake get in the way of that. I may not deserve your help, but they do. ALICIA: 6,000,000 euros. (ALL GASPING) I would like to bid 6,000,000 euros for the necklace... Aunt Alicia? ...on that young woman's neck, whomever she may be. What are you doing? I'm doing precisely as she has asked. I'm helping. Sold for 6,000,000 euros to one Miss Scott. (CHUCKLING) Yeah! No! But? Thank you. Why are you just standing there? Arrest them! For what? They seem very nice. They stole my necklace. But the necklace is here, no? Well, they kidnapped me and they tied me up. And yet, you too are here. I see no problem, everybody is very happy. Excuse me, but I am not happy. Hmm. But this I can do nothing about. So, where to? Let's go home. GRACE: I don't know, Meg. Have you really thought about this? No! No, not at all. But what did you tell your dad? Well, I told him I'd call and check in every day, that I won't tell him everything I'm doing, that I'll be back in August, and then I hung up very quickly. (LAUGHS) You, take care of my sister. RILEY: Precious cargo. My driver will take you to the airport. Bye, you two lovebirds. Please tell Theo I said goodbye. I will be sure to. And that he was right. I am different. He knows that. But I'll tell him. Thank you. Bye. - Au revoir! - See you later. Au revoir. (CELL PHONE RINGING) Hi, Mom. Yeah, we had an amazing time. (CHUCKLES) (BOTH SCREAMING) (RILEY WHOOPING) (BOTH LAUGHING) Just like that. Try it out. Hey, Grace, I need somebody to run to the post office. I'll do it. ARCHITECT: That was it. Yes, all right. Now I am going to show you the foundation of the new stadium, which is possibly to be ready by the end of the month. We will have new lighting for each classroom, and the computers will be here by September. Superbe. Fine. Thank you very much. ARCHITECT: So, what do you think? THEO: Well, it's amazing. This follows the same model as you saw it in Rajasthan. This is the dormitory? Yes, for about 100 children. And on the other side we have the garden. Excuse me one moment. Grace! (MUFFLED) Grace! Grace! (WHISTLES) Theo. What are you doing here? I'm working. What are you doing here? I'm volunteering. I don't think that we've properly met. I'm Grace Bennett. Theo Marchand.
