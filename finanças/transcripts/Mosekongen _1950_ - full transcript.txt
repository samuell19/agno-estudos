I have stood here for a thousand years followed after the families that fade and come Nodded goodday to the dawning spring A waved farewell to the urgent summer I was the refuge and harbor of the helpless often I have shielded the wounded hare The larks sit safely in my arms looked towards the sky with eyes so clear It was a really warm Danish summer evening. It's almost two years ago. A traveling market had come to the area, and the most of the inhabitants of the parish came ready to amuse themselves. At the shooting range stood Hald, a former criminal assistant. He was now retired and had settled down in the woodcutter's house. (Noisy carnival music.) He hadn't forgotten how to handle a firearm to the great delight of his wife Johanne. Thanks. Sander and his wife were also there. She was a sweet and fine woman, everyone liked her. Also Anne, his daughter from his first marriage. There was a good rapport between them. Anne was a sweet girl. It was for her sake that I came. Suddenly she caught sight of me. (The bell rings) (The bell rings) Jesper Madsen was a wealthy property owner. It was his wife who had the money. Well done, Jorgen. Here you go, Jesper. Then it's your turn. My turn? No thanks. I can resist, you know. They just have to hit the stick like me. Like you? Yes, please. Well, I will definitely not want to meet you on a dark road with the powers you have. I can understand that . I am also dangerous. - I think so, I'll try. - No, you shouldn't make yourself a laughing stock. (Dance music) He should remember that he is the nephew of the landowner Instead of strolling around with Sanders' girl. Hanne is very sweet, Abelone. She has something that money can't buy. Maybe our Ellen hasn't? Of course . She is beautiful and has been in Copenhagen and been educated. She has, and I agree with that. She has to go up. She must not spend the rest of her life as a landlord's wife like someone else. I have my plans. You are anxious, Abelone. You push on like that. Ellen is dancing there. There, with JellIng. Engineer JellIng, you know. Well, him. I thought you had took from the box when you ran away to South America. I neither stole nor ran away. Sad. I think it sounded so romantic and exciting. I was a completely ordinary young man. Not ordinary, huh? So a quite unusual young man with an unusual mess in his money matters. And who was sent off on the third class. And came home to a small gossiping provincial town on first with the wallet full of hard currency. It's always nice to come home and meet old friends. (Dance music) ... to the church bell's evening song... That's a boring guy, that Just. He is not one of God's good sons. Shall we Dance? I got past the old path it's as if made for a little romance hither he took in peace and quiet on an evening trip to a small bridge there I kiss your fair locks to the evensong of the church bells then we follow the old path In the magic of the sunset It was good you stopped. Nobody wants to listen to you. Yes, there is. Mr. Monk sings well. Only the little skank thinks so. What did they say? Can't you hear? - Yes, and I can do more than that. - Jorgen... Come on, Sander. Now Just making trouble again. If only my husband could forget that he has been with the police. On him, Joergen! - Joergen, it is beneath your dignity. - After all, he only labels himself. Jorgen! Come on. Do you hear? (Dance music) Shouldn't we go? No, it means nothing. Now he also runs away, that rascal. Don't understand you want to work with him. He just had one beer too many. And he is not completely uneven. - He can just wait. - Yes, you look a little hot. - Do you have to throw away the jacket? - For me, you can throw whatever you want. - What do you think, Hanne? - Of course. - But only if you also throw away yours? - Come on, Joergen, now we're going to dance. - Now I have to take your jacket. - Thanks. Sorry, Ellen. Come a moment. Come here and sit down, Joergen. No thanks. I have to meet someone. - Well, who is it? - I'm not saying that. Thanks for the dance. Wonder what he's up to? Just nearby lay the mill. The informer later said that he had often witnessed an unseemly act. The defendant claimed in court to have recognized the assailant... ... who was captured, convicted on circumstantial evidence... ... and placed with the other prisoners in the prison's dressing room. That's why I'm sitting here. Was it with a hammer or a club? It wasn't me who did it. It wasn't you who did it. So you're a little lead violet who got into the shade by mistake. It's like a whore's game, you. Do you think it's a lie? Yes, so decided. You're not an expert, man. Honorary Sofus Hansen, habitual offender. So: What did you hit him with? If you don't believe what I say, shut up. So you haven't beaten him, you haven't. Ouch! (The knocks) It's very well done, that a man of my intelligence should be sitting here sewing postman trousers. There is no justice to. I can't stand postmen. Bills, tax bills and appointments, huh? Well, but you haven't beaten him? Perhaps you have an old mother waiting for her little innocent son? No, I have not. My parents died many years ago. I was brought up by an uncle. Now they can be nice. I have an uncle in Copenhagen right across from Thorvalsen's Museum. Where do you live? A place called Kaerholm. Oh... And here lies Kaerholm Castle, the park and the flower swamp, which together with widening make up an area of ​​500 acres of land. Linde North has long since dried up. Yes I know. It stands up to my grounds. It was all swamp, wasn't it? We have reclaimed and drained 900 acres of land, and it is now fertile. 35 young farmers have already brought home the first year's crops. It's a good job you've done, Sander. Yes, yes, but we must continue. It is absolutely necessary, that we will get those channels through the bog, and now we are at the goal. The land plot committee will finally expropriate a piece of Kaerhoej bog. If there is a mood for it. There can be no doubt about that. Nah, I guess it can't. But it is Claus Munk who owns the bog, and he also has his supporters here in the area. He's not the kind to mess around with. After all, he is persistent, him the bog king. WE have always preferred to have this matter resolved peacefully and amicably. But for years he has put obstacles in the way of the moss made. Why should a single man spread his word over many hundreds of acres of land, that can certainly be cultivated and provide farmers with a good livelihood? No, of course. People must be able to understand that. You, editor Andreasen, must be able to do something there. Yes, you can swear that the columns in my magazine must be open for that matter. WE don't let ourselves be stopped because a man likes flowers. But does the vote decide it in the last instance? Yes. That means, Inspector Hald, who is a good friend of Claus Munk, is up at his place to make one last attempt at to get it all to slide in peace and tolerability. So now we'll see. What you say is of no use. I have spoken my opinion, and it stands firm! Should others be allowed to take, what has belonged to my family for many hundreds of years? There is a damn thing called property rights. Yes, but if the mood in the parish goes against you, then you will have to bow down. If nothing else so purely morally. Never in my life. And now I hope you have understood me. It hurts me, Claus. I would like to spare you a great humiliation, and it will be. Come over here, Martin. I can't let go of that bog. But why must everything that is beautiful also be destroyed? Now look out there. Yes, the bog is beautiful. I have always been out there with my joys and sorrows. The bog is like an oasis of peace in the midst of a troubled world. They talk about the empty bog, but look now, what life is stirring. Hear the many bird voices. And now look there. Mikkel the fox is coming. And the flowers. You won't find flora like it in the whole of Denmark. Nah, this is nice, you. Both in sunshine and gray weather, and when the mist under evening rises between the reeds. But here, too, there is hangedynd. Deep bog holes. It is dangerous here for those who do not know the ways. But I know the way everywhere in the bog. Over there is what I want to show you. (bird chirping) No, how beautiful it is here. I have never been here before. Nah, but you're also the only one I've ever taken out here. I understand you don't want to get rid of the moss. It is a delightful spot. It's not just that, MartIn. It was approximately at this place that my mother drowned. WE never found her, you know. And this is mother's garden, this one. It has been many years since. Yes. And it's the only burial place I've been able to give her. You must be able to understand then, that I can't calmly watch someone come and take this away from me. Nah, you... Damn! It looks like they are allowed to drain that bog. So all our speculation with those grounds goes down the drain? I'm afraid of that. It is well done. Here you enticed me to put all I own In some plots, which we must now cede to the bog's lay without a penny's profit. If my plans had succeeded, we would have made a fortune to sell the plots for summer villas and beach hotels. I have done what I could. Really? Have you? I got Joergen Munk out of the way. He would oppose us. You have always had a good eye for him. Yes, right from when we went to school together. I remember when, some time ago, money had disappeared from the teacher's room. Then Joergen Munk would immediately be useful and have me hanged for it! I was expelled and sent to work. I have had to suffer for my feet since I was 12, while he has got everything served. Money. Position. Name. I had to go abroad to get a chance. After all, it has become a complete mental complex with you. Is it that strange? Here I come home, and who is still in the way? Jorgen Munk. He has benefited from sitting and thinking. But what have we achieved in the two years he has been in? For example, I have become a member of the the bog council. We have also enjoyed it very much. Nah, but we can get it. What do you mean by that? When it came down to it one day, it turned out that Sander had used some of the company's money. In other words, trusted means. That man will never do that. Nah, he wouldn't. But he has a wife. You really look like yourself. What do you want to achieve with it? Simply getting Sander removed. It would be a small matter for me to become chairman. And then I'll probably have the case turned the way we want it. We don't have to look at it so darkly. The sun is shining and the birds are chirping. Hanne! Hi, Hanne. It was a long time ago. You have also been in Copenhagen for almost a year. Hear, what is that? You've gone and become too much of a beauty in the meantime. Should I have a competition here in the area? You look a bit pale. You don't have heartbreak, do you? Nah... It was a man you were thinking of. Speaking of men. Have you heard that Joergen is coming home soon? - No. - Yes. I am also thinking of getting married. Easter Farm is for sale now. I have the money, but I also need a husband. - You mean Jorgen? - Yes, why not? He probably can't count on his uncle anymore after what has happened. - So you think Joergen did it? - Yes of course. Who else? Ellen! Your father's black bull has torn itself loose. It is so evil that grasshoppers fly around it. It was the one who was about to stab our forage master to death the other day. Dad! The black bull has torn itself loose! Oh, gosh! We must try to catch it, Before it causes accidents. (Bells are ringing) (Whistles.) (Muh) Sorry, couldn't you move, because I wanted to continue, right? Stop looking so mad. No one is doing anything to you. Be a little quick now. I'm not an acrobat. Beware! He is dangerous! - Who? - The bull! Ouch! (Muh) He's going down there! Yes, that stupid pig. - Does it hurt a lot? - Hurt? That's not the word. It's probably a worse stud. Thank you, little lady, for saving my life. Can I sell you something? I have my pockets full. Coffee stamps, postcards, knit knacks? Lanyards, hosiery, razor blades? Well, no, the last thing is Not... Nah, now I have... A small moment. I'll bet ten pieces of beetroot that your name is Hanne. How do you know that? I have a letter for you. To me? - Well, it's from Joergen! - Yes, so decided. (Two chimes) What are you doing over there? Sorry. I was just checking to see if anyone was home. There usually is. Who should you talk to? The landowner. It is me. It gives me immense pleasure to greet the landowner. My name is Sofus Hansen. What do they want? I come as a second Santa Claus with a fresh greeting from my good friend Joergen Munk. Please come along to the office. I don't want to discuss that here. Well, how are you, Hansen? Nah, now I have everything... that's Hald, the Criminal Investigation Department. Maybe they just came out? That's right and I bring a greeting from our good friend Joergen. How is he? Under the circumstances, very well. I follow. Sorry, Mr. Landlord. Isn't it a little frivolous to leave my bike here unattended? You can safely leave it standing. We are decent people here. Oh yeah... I guess they all have bikes. (Laughs) Go ahead and jump In, Hansen. Here you go. Thank you. It was, however, an unusual collection of old furniture. Beautiful. Valuable. And it stands excellently where it stands, right, Hansen? Yes, so decided. Are you coming then? Thank you. (Clears throat) My, where you live is nice. Do sit down. So you visited the prison and spoke to my nephew? Yes, more specifically called Nyborg, but it was only a short visit. He's not sick, is he? He didn't suffer from anything during the time we sat together. They have been sitting together? What did you sit for this time, Hansen? Nothing. It was something with a money exchange. A pure and simple trifle, Mr. Landlord. There is no justice to. Now he sits and growls on the second year without having done anything. Something like that makes you bitter. And he is therefore bitter. Does he still maintain his innocence? So decided. I've been saying that all along. He is innocently convicted. The case has been thoroughly investigated by the police. The police... (Laughs) On forgiveness, Mr. Detective. Here the chief of police behaved like a stooge. The case was obvious. Yes, all too obvious in my opinion. Martin, I do not wish to resume our discussion on that topic now, here. It's too embarrassing for me. Yes, for you. What about him? If you don't believe him, we're pretty far gone, aren't we? You knew him for years. I've only been talking to him for a few months, and I believe in him one hundred percent. He is not the type. If it was something with general fisticuffs, then sure, but that he had to sneak a thousand crowns out of a man's pocket. Did you have any other message from my nephew? It is not a decided message, but I know how you feel when you get out and go home. I thought it would be homely when I was here. They were here? I am always ready to make a sacrifice for a comrade. And Joergen is a friend. So if the landowner had a guest room. I have not. Just a very small one. Neither have I. Nah... And as I have always heard, people were so hospitable in this country. Martin, you are so good to take that gentleman with you. - Come on, Hansen. - A moment. Is it too early in the season to buy a Christmas card? Christmas card? Yes, with goblins. Here are big and small gnomes. Goblins in all sizes. - There you go, here are 10 crowns. - Thank you very much. Then the whole assortment is yours. Thanks, it could be the same. I must say. Thank you very much. - It was a shame it didn't work. - Yes, it was a shame for Joergen. - For Joergen? - I don't ask rich people for anything. Nah, you usually take it yourself. Hear now, Detective. Good day, Mr. Hald. What kind of apparition was that? The landlord's cousin. She runs the household at Kaerholm. I thought it was the Black Lady. Has Hald now again been here with bad news? No, it was just about Joergen. He will be home soon. Do we now have to start all over again? Johanne? Go ahead and enter. My wife is probably in the kitchen. Criminal. Criminal. Shhh! SHUT UP, dammit. - You can think I'll take you. - (screek) Are you really smart, man? Yes, you're laughing. Good day, Mr. Hansen. And welcome. I hear you and my husband are workmates. Yes, on each side of the counter. He has always been a gentleman, right down to his fingerprints. But would you like to drink a small cup of coffee with us? I have made up my mind in my crazy head that Joergen has to get compensation. It's probably not that crazy, that head. They could have become an excellent policeman. You really don't need a head for that. Pardon. Listen here, Hansen. Would you consider working with me on Joergen's case? You can keep your eyes open when you drive around selling small effects. Then I would suggest that you move into the inn. - Do you have any money? - Money? After all, I have the rest of my salary from the the bars in Nyborg. And then the ten here. Otherwise just come to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Detective. How much is it? 12.30, but we can write it on the bill. Here you go. Here is 15 crowns. I can drive you right up, Mr. Munk. Thank you, I prefer to go. It probably also looks the prettiest. (Barks) Well, you come here and say hi to me? (Howls) Good day, dear Rasmussen. Welcome home. May I? The landlord is waiting for you inside his office. - He is alone. - Thanks. Good day, uncle. Good day, my boy. And welcome home again. Sit down, Joergen. You've had a rough time, I can see. I have, yes. And you probably have too. You must have gone through quite a bit because of me. Now we only have to think about your future. It draws differently than I had planned. I have always loved you, Joergen. You know that. And I was happy to leave Kaerholm to you. But now I am a convicted person. Just say it. We might as well see it in our eyes, right? But you are a good farmer. You must be able to create a future for yourself abroad. Canada for example. Because I can't stay here, you mean? Do you want to answer me about something that is very important to me? Do you think I knocked broker Just down? Do you think I stole his money? I can understand that you deny your guilt to others, but it was more worthy if you admitted it to me. That was exactly the answer I was expecting. Goodbye, uncle. - Are you going? - Yes. - Where are you going? What do you want to do? - I'll have the name Munk cleansed. Also for your sake. Rasmussen, my hat. Where is my hand luggage? In the young gentleman's room. Will you bring my clothes down to Hald? Yes... Yes. Joergen. Good day, Jorgen. Good day, Ellen. And welcome out into the fresh air. Thank you. How dejected you look, you skin. Oh? Is it that bad? Yes, quite frankly. But now you've probably finished beating other people over the head. What do you mean? It turned out to be an expensive joke, right? Think if you had killed him. I don't belong to those who look down on you. On the contrary, Joergen. I would have just proposed. . . I think I must go now, Ellen. Goodbye. (Whistles) Welcome home. Is that you, Fusse? Just take off the glasses, you are recognized. What on earth are you doing here? I have allied myself with a clever man here in the area and with a cleaner. - What do you clean? - YOU, my boy. Hald and I have had a little together on each side of the counter, so now he has turned to a professional. I walk around and sniff a little. Good day, Jorgen! - Good day, Hald. - You are eagerly awaited, my boy. Thanks. It's warm enough. Come on in and say hello to Johanne. I'd rather come a little later. Maybe someone is waiting? Maybe. Fusse, can't you take care of this? - With the greatest pleasure. - Don't get excited. There is nothing in the pockets. Bye for now. Nothing in your pockets? What did he mean by that? Yes, I wonder what, Little Hansen? And I received him with flowers. look, the sun is buzzing over the meadow The honey bee will fill her basket and there are puzzles at the table and the bed and the poorest sibling and sparrow and there is cheering all day but towards evening everything becomes so quiet spring sings its song, that's the point and my heart becomes wax in my chest there is a sound of silver in the waves of Maybrook golden rain through the evening long every field becomes a flourishing forest along the grain-rich undulating road These waves and they stand bear my soul above the edge of the sun cloud around the world are lovely kingdoms No spring like May in our country Hanne? - How nice it is to see you again. - Thank you for being here. Come. - Have you had a bad time? - We should not talk about that. Yes, we must, because I've been thinking about you so much, and I have imagined what it is like to be in prison. It's probably easier to sit there for something you haven't done rather than... After all, it is always true that there is someone who believes in one. It's enough because I know you. My uncle should know me too. But he believes that when the authorities have declared me guilty, then he must believe in the court's verdict. He doesn't think the police can be wrong. If I care about a person, I believe in him no matter what. When I left him today, I was inclined to follow him. But now I stay. I want my name cleared, Hanne. Not at least for your sake. It does not mean anything. Only I have you. That's enough, I have to make a mess. You should not be exposed to that. So you're not going to live at Kaerholm? I expect to stay with Hald. He is a wise and experienced man who can advise me. When the police came, they found two 500 crown notes in Joergen's jacket. I could not account for them. Robbery assault for the purpose of reconciliation. - That's what they called it. - You, who are the nephew of a rich landowner? Yes, but they found a letter from a prosecutor in my wallet. I had bailed for a friend, and right now I had to raise the money. Yes, it doesn't sound good. Then the food is on the table! I have covered in the gazebo. That was nice. Here you go. It must be good to have something to eat. And then we will have hoe boys on top of the shop. It's nice to be here again. We have missed you, Joergen. Do you have any enemies here? I didn't think so. But my handkerchief was placed at the crime scene. And the two notes can't walk themselves over Joergen's jacket. Did you wear it to the forest party? Yes, but I hung it from me. JellIng and I agreed that it was so hot. - Were you with JellIng? - Yes. A moment. Now we have to see here. Let's see. So here we have 'J." JellIng. Here we have him. 'Building speculator. Live in the most expensive room at the inn. 8 crowns without morning coffee. Does not use shaving soap. Has office together with agent Just. Don't trust those gentlemen completely." It was just, it went out on. Him JellIng I think I will take a little notice. Then I'll take care of Abelone Madsen. She was one of the strongest witnesses against you. Good day. It was a shame, he saw us. The gossip had to reach my husband. That would also be a shame. He is a magnificent human being. Erik, I am so unhappy that we have come to hurt him. But you can't fight love, can you? - I better get out of here. - Nah, I'll drive you up in front of the house. You must always behave openly and honestly. Well, are you there already, my friend? Have you come on an earlier train? Yes... no. It was so lucky that I met Ingenier JellIng. He said I could ride with him. Oh, but that was nice of him. Good day. - Good day, Ole farmer. - Howdy, Ingineer. Has there been anything for me? I just got here. - My name is JellIng at number 15. - Yes. Jenning. JellIng! That's what I'm saying. Snaptail. Then there's that one. Hearts! Play hearts, man. Crazy man. Then we play hearts. - There we have our buffet queen. - I don't know what you mean. I'm new here. Yes, splinter. Welcome, little troll. Listen, can't we make a deal? Coffee markers, postcards, knick-knacks, lanyards, hosiery, razor blades? - No thanks. - I have a thing for a little virgin. "Love's victim." I see you are getting a little winded. Maybe they are nearsighted? I won't have it. I suffer from a nose ring. You can see that. Can a small glass of tab bear be granted? Where I come from, we are more comfortable with cash. Thus, yes. I only have aunts. No uncles. (They're laughing) You thought it didn't come, huh? - What are they called? - Norma. Where do they come from? Beerpiece. It's pretty clear, isn't it? Cheers, Norma. Good day. Is Ingeneer JellIng at home? He has never gone up to number 15. They must go up the stairs and to the right, past the toilets. Put it on the bill, little troll. I have number 13. That's my lucky number. (banjo plays) Stop it with that spectacle. Now something has to happen. There is a vote this week. If thew bog wins, we'll be there. Take it easy. She is alone tomorrow. Tomorrow night everything will be fine. Yeah, you're so damn clever, aren't you? You were that too at the time with Joergen Munk. Have you heard his case is to be taken up again? Then you'll have to handle the peas yourself, because I don't have the nerve for that! Don't shout. The window is open. Then I'll close it. (Whvine) Well, man, what do you want? I would like to have morning coffee at eight o'clock. Crazy bird. (Humming) (Gasp) - How you scared me. - I just passed by. I'm on my way down to the mill. The old man testified against me. My case must be taken up again. Perhaps he will change his explanation. I don't believe him beyond a fool's threshold. He's a nasty old rascal. It will probably be difficult to reach the truth. But you don't give up, do you? No. I'm not giving up. On the contrary. I want the matter cleared up as quickly as possible. And then there is something I want to ask a certain young lady about. Then one has to hope that the young lady has time to wait that long. - I'm going down to the mill with you. - You know how the gossip is. Are you ashamed to follow me? There is something we have completely forgotten. Your uncle and my father are not friends. - What does that have to do with us? - They'll never go along with it. To what you wanted to ask the young lady about. Well, her. Hanne? - Is there anything else you need to bring? - No thanks. You can close it. - There is the wagon. - That was outstanding. It's JellIng. JellIng? I wonder what he has on mind? Good morning, JellIng. Come on in. Thanks. - Good day, Mrs. Sander. Am I disturbing you? - No, Not at all. I stand roughly with one leg in Copenhagen. Is there anything I can take care of while you're away? Just agitate a little for our cause. Now we must soon strike the big blow. It's going fine, you'll see. - Do they think? - Nah, I know, Sander. - Where is Hanne? - I don't know where she went. I drove past her before. She went with Joergen Munk. I see... Aah, it's true. Goodbye My friend. Goodbye JellIng. Grethe, take and give Jelling a cup of fresh coffee. I'll do that. (There is a car honk) Yes, now I'm coming! Well, I managed that very nicely. I thought he had left. I don't like this here. Do you think this amuses me? But if you want me to stay away, I will. No. You have no idea how much I care for you. And you love me too, right? Yes. It's just not worth going and lying. But now we are also going away. You are far too pretty a girl to go here and wither. You must go to Paris, London, Italy and see it all. I need to have sorted out my money. They are in New York. All that currency turmoil. But the boat that leaves Gothenburg in five days, we unfortunately will not make. I have a lot to sort out here. Where do you have your passport? - It's in the safe. - Damn. You can't open that, can you? I can do that. Here you go. Here you have it. What a pretty picture of you. I have only been to Helsingborg once. - Think about traveling REALLY. - Yeah right? What kind of stocks are these? It's property of the bog. I have an idea. I'll borrow twenty of them until Thursday. That's my money comes. The bog's shares? I just deposit them for a few days. And then we can reach the boat. - No, I don't. - Then we leave it. I would like to, but... WE won't talk about it anymore. I shouldn't have said this at all. I really want to travel with you. Yes, I thought so too. If you promise, I'll get them on Thursday. How many would you need? Twenty. But I do not want them. It was wrong of me to mention it. WE can take the next boat in a month. Take them now. - You will have sleepless nights because of that. - I won't get that either. Oh yeah. When you absolutely want to. - Good day, Ole mail. - Hi. Here is the newspaper and a package. Well, is there anything new? They must have chicken at Hald today. They have Joergen Munk living after all. And Sander has gone to Copenhagen. Really? Now again? And on top of that, just before the vote. I must go on. Is it true that Miss Ellen is going on her way? My daughter flies to Paris tomorrow. She needs some rest. Yes, you can buy so much down there. Goodbye again. Now Sander is in Copenhagen again. He spends a lot of time on the moss case. And a lot of money. Of ours. I spoke with JellIng, and he was very worried with Sander and the bog's money. - Just that there is nothing wrong. - I can't believe that. - That money is safe enough. - You are a piece of cake, Jesper. - What did I do now? - Nothing. You never do that. Can't you see where he's scrambling and tumbling with it all? But now I demand that you, as an auditor, say, that you want to see the accounts and the cash register. I don't like that. If you do as I say, we will throw out Sander and the board. And then you get the Knight's Cross that they say Sander should have. What should I do with a cross? I have you. - A Knight's Cross! - I haven't done anything. Of relevance. It must be from when he was thrown out of school. I knew he had stolen, and then another boy was blamed... Then you felled him. We'll hold at the bank. JellIng lives further away. You're not an expert, man. You don't swing up in front of the main door when you make an unofficial visit. I like the expression "visit." Yes, that's why I used it. Are you sure he's not at home? Yes, I have called. Do you think perhaps he sits and waits with tea and wheat? A quite ordinary lock. I know YOU. Shut up though, man. We are not for a bonfire. Dammit, stop that. I wanted to see if you had gloves on. I thought so. Here you go. Amateur. And now what? For now, we're sniffing around and seeing if we find anything compromising. Don't take it! I don't like this. Nonsense. It is not us who are the criminals. It's the others. What is it? Somebody's coming. Come. - The light! - Are you crazy, man? (Phone rings) Hello? Is that you, JellIng? Is that all right? Have you forgotten your keys? I'll stay here, so hurry up. It is powerful. Now comes the start of the enterprise. No, how nice he is. (It rings) Good evening. Here you go. There are the shares. Do we risk her saying something? She would rather die. I have her in the palm of my hand. It fits. 20,000. Then he has finished looking good. No, don't put them there. That's the first thing they look for. It's high stakes, huh? I'll put them here. Third shelf. Fine. (About to sneeze) This isn't completely harmless. It's not as dangerous as it was back then with Joergen Munk. He really enjoyed the cigar. It was really fun. But there I ran a risk. It was me who put my head to it. And you hit unnecessarily hard. That you want to start it again. It had to be done properly for the sake of the medical certificate. Do we have any alcohol in the house? Nothing but some beer. Then we go home to me at the inn. We must celebrate the day with a whisky. Now I think it will slide, you. Traek for. You had almost ruined it all there. You would smoke on them. I could wring their necks. Here I have been in prison for two years. - I go straight to the police. - And say what? We both heard it, and you are my witness. So it doesn't work. We are here on Burglary. It is not possible to tell the police that. If they see my smear history, Don't they get excited about me as a witness. Then we go home to Hald. - Nah, whoa. - What was there? My God, it's so small, and I love horses so much. - Come on, Fusse. - Goodbye Lotte. Shouldn't you switch off? Yes, you are really glowing. "Amateur." It's nice I have you to drive. Five minutes before, you are told that you must be the conductor at the meeting. - What do you think? Who will win the vote? - One don't know that. My heart says your uncle, my mind says Sander. We are late. Hello, Fusse. What on earth are you doing? Extra work. The little butter roll at the buffet was busy, so I had to help her. See you. For ten years now we have fought to carry out this undertaking, which will definitely mean progress and prosperity for the whole parish. Now we are finally at the goal, and you, the residents of the parish, must now decide, how about some beautiful flowers and birds in Kaerholm bog must prevent a development that will benefit us all. Plans have been drawn up for roads and parcels, and now numerous young farmers go and wait to take up the work. Hear! Hear! Claus Munk is losing some of his flower bog, and that is obviously regrettable, but the flowers that will grow up in the little gardens in the homes out there, is considerably more valuable. Then I would like to thank my employees, including the new member JellIng, for their trust and good cooperation. We have had adversity, but we welcome the result with the greatest confidence and makes us happy to see the desert bog transformed into fertile soil. (APPLAUSE) Landowner Claus Munk has the floor. It won't be easy for uncle. (APPLAUSE) In the year 1730, my ancestor, Claus Munk, Kaerholm handed over by the state for eternal inheritance and ownership. We have the old deeds with Frederik IV's signature. Kaerholm was a neglected farm, and the area was empty, almost uninhabited. But in the 200 years my family has had the estate, We have reclaimed 500 acres of land from the bog for good arable land. And the village of Linde has grown up around the farm. What are they doing? Teaching free lessons of Danish history. My ancestors were all skilled farmers, and much of the wealth found here in the region, is owed to their efforts. The bog is mine. As many of you know, my mother drowned out there. And even where one does not respect property rights, In any case, you should respect the peace of the grave. Yes, landowner Munk has spoken beautifully about the bog and his memories, but we must return to reality. Claus Munk is a very restrained man, and as he himself said, his generation has accomplished much. But just as well, it hasn't been all right. They are people too. Sour vessels We have just seen an example of. I know Munk has many followers. He is also a rich man. And it's a fact, that his stubbornness and lust for power are your fault, that Sander's Idealist work may now be coming to a standstill, BECAUSE landowner Munk only puts obstacles in our way. No, whoa! I will not listen to that. When Sander raised the matter of drying some, my uncle joined in the cause. He gave the moss the right to flow through the Lady Creek, and the amount he received for the areas, he donated to the Bog Council. (APPLAUSE) Now there will be trouble. May I be allowed? As for the scraping together money thing, so now I think that it is the case that some have to work for others. We can't all be land owners. When I go and plow on Kaerholm, then I have both horse and plow, and the whole field is all mine. There are many of us who earn our living on Kaerholm, and I probably know where I want to put my cross. I should be the last to go against Claus Munk, as much as I and my children have been helped up on the farm. At least when the old lady was alive. She had a heart for the little ones. And I think that if your mother had been here today, then she had given the young people her bog. Jesper Madsen wants to say something. Or is it Mrs Madsen? (Laughter) Yes. Yes... (APPLAUSE) It is an important matter that we must negotiate here. It is a big deal for all of us who are parties to the bog case. After all, we are dealing with large sums of money, and before the vote go in one direction or the other, then it is important that there is order in the cases. After all, I have become an auditor, after Smith Balle died. And Sander has been too busy to put me in the situation. Now I mean... now my wife thinks that I have a big responsibility, and then I must know how things are with the money. And how many have been used for representation expenses. What kind of assault is this? The Bog Council is in possession of three savings accounts with DKK 50,000. And in addition we have placed 50,000 in shares. They are at home in my safe. Jesper Madsen can examine the accounts at any time. - And he can take his wife with him. - It is not necessary when we were told. Now I demand that there be an audit with me early tomorrow. I must talk with you. This was off the agenda. There you go, editor Juul. Actually, my colleague editor Andreasen should have been arrested, because you are not allowed to invite thieves. And what you intend to do with Claus Munk is thieving. The right to property is the foundation on which we in society are built, and if a man cannot keep what is his, then all initiative and desire to work is killed, and society goes into disintegration. You must give me those shares. Which shares? The stocks you got the other day. I don't understand what you mean, Mrs. Sander. Then we'll take it easy. We behave nicely, don't we? You begged me to take them. Make no mistake about it, my friend. The stocks stay where they are. Goodbye. Erik! JellIng. Now the voting has started. So what? If it now goes against us? I have a card in my hand. Trump, you understand. What is it? It is, after all, a sketch of the bog. Exactly. See the hatched line there? There is a barrier of roots just below the surface of the water. How did you discover it? It will be my business. - Does the landlord know? - No. - What is it worth to us? - Lots, dear friend. - You just go down and probe the terrain. - Yes. Then there is hot coffee. Is there going to be a break-in tonight? Otherwise, I would like to offer the little one at the buffet in the cinema. Go on in peace. It will be difficult. She is on the verge of falling for me. - Waitor? - A moment. There is a colossal turnout. It will be interesting. Hopefully it will go as it should. Have you seen Grethe? Hasn't she gone home? Someone said she left when Abelone started. Then I run home to her. Yes, it does, my girl. Thank you. It's going well, Sander. We haven't won yet. No, but we will. Well, here you are. Why did you leave the meeting? Did you get sick? What's wrong? You're crying. Now tell me what's wrong. Better go, Hanne. You can't help me. Will you answer me honestly about something? How long have you known JellIng? - Has anyone said anything? - No. I'm the only one who noticed because I know and care about you. I just can't understand you can do that to dad. Hanne. Your father and I were happy when we got married. But it lasted far too short a time. Then he forgot me for his work. His time, his strength, his nerves and his feelings. He has sacrificed on only one thing: the bog. The rest of us came in the second row. You're young. You don't understand how humiliating it is for a woman, that one's husband never notices her. - And did JellIng? - Yes. Do you love him? You have no idea how mean he has been. I might as well say it as it is. He has lured me into handing over 20,000 crowns worth of shares. Now it's going to go over your father. I'm so desperate, Hanne. How should I get it said? There he is. How did it go, dad? We lost, Hanne. You must not say anything about the shares now. Dad lost the bog case. What about the revision tomorrow? I run over and talk to Joergen. If nothing else, we must have it postponed. - You must not walk through the bog. - It's not that dark at all. So Claus Munk walked away with the victory. He got 34 more votes than us. It's a bit bitter after twelve years of hard work. It is also a shame for you, because you have been magnificent all this time. And now I had just thought that I should be something for you. But we have each other. Claus Munk can't take that away from us. (Crying) (Screams) Help! Aah, help! Help! Do me the favour of turning off that radio. I thought you liked music. Not tonight. I'm thinking about something Hald said the other day. "It hurts to be wronged, but it's hard to be right." If anyone is right, it's you. You only have reason to be proud of your victory today. It is not so dangerous now, faced with pride. It was sudden, however, that fog came. And it gets closer and closer. You can barely see the trees in the park. - What was that? Did you hear that? - What? It sounded as if someone was calling for help. Help! It's down from the bog. Hello! Hanne! Rasmussen, hurry and get a lamp. But Claus! Now I have to. What do you look like though? She had fallen in the bog. Rasmussen, watch out for the expensive cover though! - She has to go to bed. - Do you know her? Yes, that's Sanders' daughter. We went to school together. Klara, can you make sure she gets a warm bath and some dry clothes? Hanne can fit my clothes. Then you make sure she gets up in a warm bed in the large guest room. - The large guest room? - I said "the big guest room!" You make sure she gets a cup of hot tea. OK? Yes? No, just lie down now. The bed is nice and warm. - I have to get up. Where's my clothes? - It's down and dry. I have to get to Hald. I'd like to talk to Joergen. It's important! Here you go. Here's the tea. No thanks, I don't want anything. But the landlord is on the way up. He will probably want to talk to you. How is it? It's going perfectly fine. She's laying like a princess. - Is it okay to go in there? - Uh, yes. Nah, drink the tea while it's hot. Then I sit here for so long. I have known you since you were a little girl. Your father and I were once very good friends, and I thank fate that I came early this evening. Yes. Thank you. - Otherwise I wouldn't have been here. - No, Little Hanne. You didn't have that. Now I think I must be allowed to get up and go home. I think I can sense that something is bothering you. Why did you walk alone tonight over the bog in that fog? (Sobs) Now tell me everything. Then I calmed her down. Thank God. I've made a nice hot toddy for the landlord. Thank you Rasmussen. I can sense there is something you want to say. - You don't have to say everything you think. - When we are alone, you can say anything. Did the landlord see her eyes when she regained consciousness? It was perfectly her mother's expression. Yes. It was like seeing her vividly alive. Well, good night, Rasmussen. Good night, Mr. Landlord. It's nice to switch off in the ceiling. I am disappointed with that vote. I always thought it was right. Sooner or later the bog has to be cultivated, but uncle is so persistent. - Good evening. - Good evening, Hansen. Come on in. She didn't want to go to the cinema. Has your famous charm failed you? (Phone rings) Yes? Good evening, Claus. She doesn't think I have real intentions. Do you have it? Of course I have. But real and legit are two different things. Do I have to take off my shoes? - No. What? - Well, it wasn't for me. I am so oem in the paws. I've been poking around at the swampy meeting all day. What have? I've been messing around with it meet... Well, it wasn't for me either. I'll try to fix it. Thank you for calling. Good night. Jelling has defrauded Grethe Sander of DKK 20,000 worth of paper made. It was your uncle who called. Has Sander gone to uncle? No, it's Hanne. Sander must not know anything about it. It concerns shares in Kaerby bank. Then it could be the shares he handed over to Just. The ones they didn't dare put in the safe? Your uncle asked me to get them, at worst case buy them back. He had promised Hanne to help her. Why did she go to uncle? As far as I know, she has never spoken to him before. And the worst thing is that the the Bog Council will hold a meeting tomorrow at 11. What game is this, Jelling is playing? Tomorrow early, I'm going in to Just. I know where the stocks are. I think I'm listing off now. It has been an exhausting day. - Good night, gentlemen. - Good night, Hansen. What do I owe the honour? We have come to get handed the shares of the Bog Council that you have. I don't know about that. I don't know where you want to go. They got them from Jelling. I don't discuss my dispositions. Yes, if you want to avoid the police. I don't have those shares! What entitles you to break into my office and threaten me? We can always talk about that. Hurry up, Just. Otherwise you will get the round of beating you claim I gave you then. Then you have to pay for it. I have done that. I have paid two years in advance. Jelling has said where the stocks are. - Well, has he? - Yes. Third shelf in the cupboard there. That scoundrel. It wasn't me who tricked them away from her. It was him. I just have them lying around. What the hell is that? They're not here. Now stop playing comedy. But he put them behind the book and put it on the shelf. Of course there will be losses now that the vote has gone against us. The partners put in a lot of money. But the one who is hardest hit is and will be Sander. After all, Sander is an Idealist. For him it has been a life's work. That's very kind of you, but I think more about the young men. I manage well enough. Yes, we all hope so. But that's why it was still a sin. The whole thing would surely have gone better if you had not been so optimistic. I am aware of that, and of course I also resign as chairman. And when it's all settled, my wife and I travel away. - There must be new people. - Yes. Then we have to elect a new chairman. Sander has put all his efforts into the matter right from the first day. That wasn't what we were supposed to be talking about. I guess it was the money matters. Yes, I am also interested in that after the comments Madsen made. Jesper, come with me to my office. Move it, Jesper. Well, Jorgen. Procrastinate? I cannot. They are sitting in there all together. The meeting has begun. Here are the shares and the bank books. That's nice. Then it's all right. Here you go. Nah, nah. I demand that you count. Nah. Yes. Yes. Dad, there's something I need to tell you. What is it? It can wait. I don't have time now either. It is in plumb. How? Joergen said the stocks were stolen. Stolen? Those were harsh words. I can't stand paying for something you can get for free. ... 31, 32, 33, 34... ... 35, 36, 37... ... 38, 39, 40. 41, 42, 43, 44, 45... ... 46, 47, 48, 49, 50. 51, 52, 53, 54, 55... ... 55, 57, 58, 59, 60. Well, that's right. Do you see what I said? Yes, you talk so much nonsense. Imagine moving so quickly without having to. But it was Jelling. What was it? It was, after all. He drove that way. Help me! I'm sinking! Wasn't it an idea to ease your conscience? I'm not in a hurry. Let me hear. Who knocked Just down and got me two years? It was not me! - Who was that then? - It was me! - Joergen! - I need a witness. - Then repeat: Who knocked Just down? - It was me! Help me up! It was a decent pike. Yes, and it can talk. Just let him run. He doesn't get far. Nah, I'll fix him myself. Joergen! (Sirens) They were driving a little fast, huh? May I see your driver's license? Excuse me for a moment, gentlemen. (The hammer and the knocker) You are decorating for the harvest festival again, Soeren. How many years have you been doing this? It could probably be the forty-second year this year. Is it REALLY? Time goes. We are getting old, Soeren. The landlord's nephew is here and would like to speak to the landlord. What are you laughing at? I'm just so happy. Hanne? It is me. I am waiting for my uncle. You can think I'm happy. Jelling has given full consent. Hanne? There is something I want to ask you about. I want to ask you if... You can't say that on the phone. You have to come over here and say it. I must have spoken to uncle first. I know what it means to him that I am now receiving compensation. (Doer clothes) I have to break now. Goodbye. Yes, Jorgen. I heard what you said. You were happy, you said. But that's nothing against what I am. I have never been so happy to have been wrong. Thanks Uncle. I have something interesting to show you. Hald found this paper in Jelling's wallet. This drawing actually solves the entire bog problem. A barrier of roots has formed across. This means that you can give the the forebog and the stew to the Council. Without destroying my flower swamp? Yes. It was perhaps a way out. It is a way out. Good day, Sander. I was just on my way over to you. And I was on my way over to you. Just say "you," we went to school together. I came to thank you. My wife has told me about the shares. But first and foremost, thank you for saving Hanne. Fate is strange, you. She could have been my little girl. If her mother hadn't preferred you back then. But now you get her anyway, as far as I understand. We got a lot to talk about, you. So I'm leaving here, and you've won the bog case. Wondering who actually won? It's not always so easy to get smart. Otherwise, you are not traveling from here. Yes, I can assure you of that. Not when you hear that there is a completely new way out for your plans. A resort where your entire facility and your channels come into their own. There is a barrier under the water, and it is easy to build a rampart there. - A barrier? - Yes. And then in the narrowest place. It is a large piece of land you can get. We will probably agree on the price, but there is a condition. And what is that? That you remain as chairman. Thanks. (Dance music) Can't you settle with me until he comes? (APPLAUSE) (Laughter) - You hang out, huh? - I am not seventeen years anymore. Well, it's probably a bit difficult with the breathing. Excuse me for a moment. My little butter roll. Come over here. I have a big and gracious surprise for you. If you can get your papers in order, you can sneeze for us on Sunday. So we can get married. Aren't you happy, Fusse? - Yes, so decided. - I knew that. Shall we Dance? I just have something I need to fix. Sit down here and wait. A little counterweight was missing. Should I sit here and wait? Yes, just wait here. Just wait. Then you will see what happens. (Laughs) Everything breathes peace on my paternal ground let me spread the sand and the roots You must collect the brood from the bottom of the peat bog We see peace on my dreamy heat -----Subtitles Essery-----
