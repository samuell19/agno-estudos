"Memory needs to be the path leading not only to the past, but to the future as well." Ana Blandiana In 1951, the Communist government of Romania ordered the deportation of more than 40,000 innocent people who lived near the border with Tito's Yugoslavia. Accused of being enemies of the people, they were snatched overnight from their houses, loaded onto cattle trains and thrown into the wilderness of the Baragan fields in conditions nearly impossible to survive. They were all victims of a process of eliminating political adversaries, and ethnic cleansing of the militarized border. This movie is dedicated to their memory. based on the short novel "Projects of The Past" by Ana Blandiana Baragan fields, 1956 Emil, Emil... let's just tell them we don't want to leave. Why not? If that's what we want. Want what?! Can't you see? It's over! Our island is gone! We're at their will again. It was all an illusion! "SO, WHAT'S FREEDOM?" I always stood for truth, searching for it, solving its mysteries. I knew how to tell the difference between fairy tale and reality, between knowledge and ignorance. I knew there couldn't be any knowledge without truth, and that we couldn't call ourselves free without it. As I realized fairly quickly, in fact I knew nothing at all. As the Red Army entered the country, Romania ended its alliance with Germany. The Soviet Union took its place. Stalin promised a brilliant future, a society in which men didn't exploit each other, to be built hand in hand by workers and philosophers, teachers and peasants, students and the military. I was already married to my college sweetheart, Turica Iorga, who took my last name and became comrade teacher Dumitra Bazan. We were both working at the same school. Today... ... freedom is our precious reward for having fought so hard for a justice. That's why it needs to be treated very, very carefully... Being free doesn't mean one can do anything, anywhere, anyhow... So, what's freedom? - I'll expect your answers next time. Yes? - Yes! Turica taught French, and I history, of course. We loved each other, so the future seemed filled with hope and aspirations. Wait... wait. Try a little more seduction... C'mon, tell me more about Paris... When everything calms down... ... fraternity, freedom, equality! We'll take Paris! You promise? I swear it. Bazan! Stroe worked for the Secret Police. He was... how should I call him? Our "Serviceman". We didn't know anything about him, but he knew everything about us. Thank you. The party has great plans for you. - But, so do we. - I'm so glad to hear that. Of course, only if your wife decided to finally help out... What do you mean? Russian is the language of the future. French belongs in the past, which we already buried. Vigilence begins at home. Stroe showed up in Herculane right after travel abroad became strictly regulated and controlled. All contacts with the Western world were forbidden. After Stalin expelled Tito's Yugoslavia from the International Organization of Socialist Republics the Serbs suddenly became our biggest enemy. The threat of war with Yugoslavia grew day by day Stroe was charged with protecting us. Turica couldn't stand him. Comrade Colonel Stroe has been further delayed. We must unmask our enemies: the American and English imperialists, their lackeys, like Tito, and many others, show the world their true colors, put them to death if necessary... You're coming to Toplet tomorrow, right? You're not teaching. Does Emil know the wedding's at a kulak's place? Did the Party give him permission? This is no joking matter, Yvonne. Really... Indeed. You know my uncle, right? They took him 2 days ago. He owned 5 acres of land, from his grandparents. Wouldn't give them up to the Party. And now look... He got hard labor... Maybe they hold him until they solve the Serb issue at the border, and then they'll send him back home. From deportation? Nobody ever came back. How can you take these things so lightly, Turica? I am still going to the wedding. You? Leaving. Tonight. I'm crossing the Danube to Yugoslavia. You can't do that! There must be another way, something... I didn't find one. Did you? ... everybody will receive what they need, and will work according to their abilities. This is the brilliant future of communism. Bazan! - Everything in order at school? - All good. I'm here about my travel request to Paris. I hear your students like you a lot. You challenge them to think for themselves. - Yes. - Not bad. Was going to Paris your wife's idea? An old promise I made, from our college days. And who's idea was it to go to Blajinu's wedding in Toplet? - What's got into you? - It's Radio France, currently forbidden! You'll get us in trouble. Is it hard to understand? It's only music... Don't worry, tomorrow there'll be plenty of food in Toplet. They're roasting up a whole pig, a veal, baking a hundred pastries, eight cakes... It'll be a fairy tale wedding, you'll see. We're not going. What? What are you talking about? All the teachers were invited. Ion is our colleague. Emil? I talked to Stroe today. He's in charge of our travel request. Once he approves it, nobody will stop us anymore. But you have to forget about Blajinu's wedding. It's Paris, or Toplet. Your choice. Village of Toplet 12 km. from Herculane Hey! Listen up, all of you! Anyone brave enough, come to the wedding! The entire village is invited! Did you hear me? I dare all of you to come! Listen, you fool! Even if they sent me to Siberia... ...they couldn't stop Miron from throwing his daughter the best wedding ever! - Shut up! You'll get us in trouble again. - Let me be, woman. Music! Yugoslavia is one of the founding members of COMINFORM, but its leader, Joseph Tito refuses to follow orders sent by the Soviets. The tensions between Tito and the Soviet block have escalated. Both Yugoslavia and pro-Soviet Romania are sending their troops to the Danube border, in the Banat region. Both governments ... Sources tell us that Romania has restricted civilian traffic from an area of 25 km North of the Danube river, bordered by Yugoslavia to the West, and by Orsova, Toplet and Herculane to the East. Confrontation between Tito and Stalin's allies could start at any moment. Here is Radio France! - Hello. - Hello. Nothing yet? I'm scared, Grandma... How long can love last? Why don't you let God worry about tomorrow? Live in the moment! Enjoy it! Wait... that's to pay off any evil, send it away... Thank you, God bless. Made my choice. I'll be back tomorrow. No further than Toplet. Comrade Bazan!.... Good day to you. I have a letter for your wife. I think she's been expecting it for some time. You should read it first. You never know these days. But it's open. How else? It's from abroad... Careful with that, I'd say... Yes? Hurry up! Go sit down! - You know him? - No. Rich landowners live here Hey, you fool!... Crazy guy! - How're the women in there? - There's no more time... - What? - Time, time! There's no more time... Well... Well what? Listen, Ion! Ana is my only one. Understand? I've cared for her like the eyes in my head! You have no idea how many pregnant girls the Russians and Germans left behind. Difficult times are coming. Take good care of her. You hear me? Ana! - Welcome! - Great to see you! - Congratulations! So happy for you! - Thank you! - I'm so glad you made it! - He wouldn't miss it! - Welcome! - That's her. - Hi! Turica. - Ana. - Pleased to meet you. - You , too. Ion has told me so much about you and the school. We're planning on moving to Herculane, as well. - When? - After the wedding. - Right away? - Yes. - What are your plans there? - Go to nursing school, God willing. Very well. Mom, you can't do that. It's the bride's apple! - Emil! Let's go. - Please, make yourselves at home. Keep it up! - Has anyone else come from the school? - No. It's probably this whole situation with the Serbs... What situation, Emil? A wedding's a wedding! What does a wedding have to do with politics? They didn't come because... they're cowards. How come you two made it? Did I ever tell you? After our first dance together I tried to imagine... what it'd be like to still dance with you at 50... That's when I knew I wanted to marry you. You're handsome when you smile. Let's dance. C'mon! Come on! Down with landowners! Fire one off, soldier! What a big man you are Marin when the army is behind you! Silence! Silence, and in the name of the law... pay attention to Mister... I mean our Comrade here! According to the Romanian People's Republic's Council of Ministers' decree number 200 from 1950, supplemented by decree number 344 from March 15th. 1951, and by the ruling of our State Security Services, all present here are subject to immediate, mandatory evacuation and relocation to an assigned residence, as they are enemies who have jeopardized the People's Democratic Regime. The evacuation will commence 2 hours from the reading of this decree, under the supervision of the State Security and of the Ministry of Interior, in the presence of the local authorities. Is that clear? Comrade Sargent, I live a short ways away, at the railway crossing. My shift starts in less than an hour. What, didn't you hear me? Start packing, now! I'm comrade Bazan, history teacher in Herculane, with my wife. - We're about to leave. Do your job. - Nobody leaves. You're all under arrest. There's been a mistake. Call Herculane. Comrade Stroe, at the Ministry of Interior. He can vouch for us. A mistake? You mean to say that our Party makes mistakes? Would you look at him? He's under arrest, and continues to speak against the Party. Get on your knees!... On your knees!... Right now! I should shoot you just for saying that! Filthy landowner! Everyone, pack your bags! That means everyone. You have two hours! Thieves! C'mon! Move! What's with that music? Move! It's my right! You gave it to me! To hell with you and your people! Fucking German! You want wood? Here, build yourself a coffin! You'll need it where you're headed. Get out of here, damned Nazi! Don't run! Come here! - Where's my father? - You'll find him where you're going. Don't kill her! Kill me instead! Not Ilinca! Let her go! Let her go! It's alright, Father Mom... He doesn't feel well. - To Siberia? - How are you? Oh, dear Jesus! I bet they're taking us straight to Siberia. I can't breathe, Granny. Move over. Does anyone have water? I've got some, Maria. - Ancsi!... Ancsi! - Come back here! Is it yours? - Ancsi! - Come back now! Mine is Ana. Ancsi, come back here! Did you marry him? Ancsi... They warned me. Didn't they? And what did I do? How could I let her go alone, when the political situation is what it is? I'll figure it out , don't worry. We'll be back home in no time. We have to teach tomorrow, don't we? What the hell did I say now? Lock on target! At my order... Open it! - Cosasu Sabina - Here. - Fidel Jonas! - Here. - Berca Eugen! - Here. Simion Sofia! I'm comrade Emil Bazan. There's been a mix-up... - Simion Vasile! - Yes. - Bazan Dumitra! - Here. - Bazan Emil! - Here. - Ornea Isaac! - Yes. - Ornea Esther! - Yes. Do you wanna play, kitty? - Bercu Iolanda! - Here. - Morosan Floarea! - Yes. Let's go! Ancsi! Don't run! - Ancsi, don't run! - Stop right there, or I'll shoot! Come back here! Ancsi! He's not breathing, comrade! - And the child? - It took them both out. You, damned rich bitch! Why did he have to run? To make me kill a child? Huh?! Tell me! Get them out of my sight! Into the trucks! That's an order! - Where are you taking us? - Move! - Keep moving, don't you hear? - Don't push her! - Ion! - Ana! Move! Move! Go! - Ion, don't leave me! - Ana! - Ion! - Ana! Ready this one! Go! - Ion, don't leave me! - Ana! Ready this one! - Hop in! Go! - Ion! Ion, don't leave me!... Ion! Comrade soldier, please stop this truck! My wife and I don't belong with these people. Why did I fight in the Resistance, just to... You, communist pig! You're welcome. The Baragan fields The Ministry of Interior of Romania hereby decrees the mandatory removal and relocation of all enemies of the Romanian Workers Party, the Soviet Union, and their leaders. Leaving the area within a 15 kilometer radius, as well as contact with outsiders without prior authorization are strictly forbidden. Is it clear? Wait! When are the others coming? Where are they? Where are the others?! We have to make a fire. For the night. And a shelter, too. They just left and Fritz is the one giving orders now? Make them yourself, if you are cold. Get going! What are you staring at? We leave tomorrow morning. The man said 15 km. That means there might be some villages 20 km. away. We'll sort it out there. You can go. I'm not coming. And I won't be waiting for you. I'm tired of waiting. Wanna know how long? Since they got you to start following them blindly, wherever they wanted. You never said no, and you forgot about us. And since they started thinking for you, and all you did was cheer them on. What's left to do? Don't you get it? This is our Siberia. It's over! Has anyone seen my husband? Hey, who took my bicycle? Are you all deaf? Bazan! Here, Bazan! Where to, Bazan? Paris? Please, leave me alone! I did everything you asked of me. Where did I go wrong? Maybe you'll learn to toe the line! You have one friend left: Baragan! It's a... it's a mistake... It has to be... - Make sure you don't lose it, too! - But it's a mistake... There's no way... Take a sip, Father. Are there any priests left who are good for anything? The German's right. God sent us here and forgot about us. And we've forgotten who we are. Dear God... If you only knew how much I prayed for Him to take me. To set me free... Jonas, who are you to judge? You think you're better than us? That's why your wife left you? At 40 years old, all alone, and with no kids... Not your business! Only my business! We all have sinned... Do you think you'll see your husband again? I'm sure I'll never see mine again. What's up, Fritz? Come with me! Coming. Ion came to our village 3 years ago. With the literacy task force. Knocked me off my feet. I haven't stop falling since then. You know what I really regret?... I am sorry that... I'm sorry I didn't let him do it... You know? I insisted on marrying him a virgin. I think you did the right thing. Help! Here! See those stars up there in a W shape? ... That's "the hen with the chicks". As long as they're shining, we're good. It's autumn. When you see a triangle of lights lower to the left, that means winter's coming. That means certain death. You freeze. Why didn't you leave with your husband? - What did you say your name was? - Culai... And yours? Drink, Father. - Then, why are so calm, Culai? - Well... Well what? School of Arts and Literature at the University of Paris During the war I saw so much death, eventually it started to feel like I was slowly dying. I deserted. The dead with the dead, the living with the living. Let them go... You have to let them go their way. Ana, Turica! Look, look over the hill! Your men! I don't know what to tell you, but look! It's them! Why did you come back? What, did they pay you to come back and bury us? We'd rather freeze to death here, than be killed by your kind. - Where did you find Ion? - In the fields. And you brought him here for the secret police to come after him? He's right. As soon as they make the connection, they'll be looking for him here. We'll all be punished. - We have to turn Ion in! - Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! You, fucking Secret Policeman! Cups, bowls... a picture, put it there... one samovar A lamp... A letter for you from France. Scissors... It would be an honor to have you here as soon as possible, ...a trunk... ...as a guest teacher at the Sorbonne. ...a balance... What were you afraid would happen if you told me? I'm sure Stroe knew about it. Calm down, calm down. He wouldn't have cleared us for travel anyway. It'll be alright. You'll see. If we do what they say, we'll be out of here soon. For fuck's sake, Tristan Tzara is a communist. We'll get to him. I want my life back. Can you give me that? Can you? We have to ration our supplies. As long as we still have milk, we won't die of hunger. But we need to work carefully on gathering seeds for the spring. What do you mean spring? - You mean our baby will be born here? - Only if we can make it through winter. We could've tried to run away, but there was nowhere to run. We were on an island... stuck between a confusing past and an uncertain future, victims of our lives' wreckage. Here, it was up to us wether we lived or died. At least we were left the freedom to make that choice. There is an accent here. - My name is... - And an apostrophy here... And missing another letter here. - My nEme is... - No. My name is. My name is. Yeah... good. You think this is how you seduce a woman? Well... No? I love you. I love you. I love you. Dear Lord, our Father... It's been a while since I lost track of You. If You were the one who decided to give me a family again... ...this time, please, do not take it away from me. From your Papa. Thank you. His servant Ioan I betroth to His servant Ana, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. His servant Ana I betroth to His servant Ion, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, amen. Godparents, exchange rings. We have company. - Hurry up! - C'mon! In formaaa-tion! Name! Jonas Friedl. Dumitra Bazan. Niculae Ifrim. Emil Bazan Father Nicodim Enache Ileana Saculean Agnes Ferencz Ana Saculean What about Ion Blajinu? Where is he? You didn't hear my question? I haven't seen him. Since you took him away from me. Where is he? Bourgeois bitch! Looks like you've built yourselves a little hotel out here. Prove to me the Party was mistaken about you. Tell me where Ion Blajinu is, and you and your wife can go home. Right now. You'll be home tomorrow. I don't know where he is. Murderer... Murderer... Murderer... murderer! Murderer! Murderer! Careful now! Murderer! Murderer! You didn't see him, right?! Fucking asshole teacher! You think you can fool me? You think you're so smart? You piece of shit! Ion, I can't feel the baby anymore. He's here, but he might be hungry, too. Turica! I'm done! Even my brain is frozen, and so's all your French in it. Wait! There's something left, though. I'm hengry... I'm hungry... I'm hangry... - I'm... - I'm... - Hungry... - Hongry... - Hungry... - Hungry... I'm so hungry, I'd eat this wood if it weren't so frozen. - Are you ok? I was afraid that... - That what? I love you. Why don't we start over? We could have a life we want here. Here? Today, we finally eat! Today is Christmas. - Is it meat? - It's a surprise. It's a secret... until tonight. He caught something... maybe a rabbit. - God provided! - Maybe two! It's a surprise... it's a secret... until tonight... until tonight. What if I die before tonight? Dear God, bring light into the hearts of our enemies harming us, and make them good, and fill them with love so that we can live in peace and forgive our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. In the name of the Father, of the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen! Amen! We'll split it, so that there's enough for everybody. Lay down. Easy... - Don't go. - Just a moment. Wait. Please Ion, don't go. Father... May God forgive me for what I am about to say, but if He gave us a child, why doesn't He give us anything to feed him? One rabbit won't see us through to spring. There's a gypsy village about 20 km. from here. No one dared mess with them. Not before, and not the communists now. With some money, we could buy whatever from them. Why didn't you say anything until now? Well... Here's Fundata, where the train dropped us off. We are here. The Gypsy village is somewhere around here. It might take me 7 or 8 hours of walking. I'll be back in 2 or 3 days. But... What happens if the Secret Police catches you? I know my way around, Father. I worked on the railroad here. Let's see how much money we can pull together. I'm coming with you. Let's go! What are you still looking for, Bazan? Bazan! Give Culai up, and maybe we'll give you a second chance. C'mon, professor! Hurry up! You're after my wife! I'm talking to you! You'd better shut up and walk. Go away! Father... I want to confess. Professor! Professor, come eat! Five minute break to eat. Eat! You're trying to poison me! What business did you have at a landowner's wedding, you snitch? Tell me! What do you know about us? Tell me... What do you want from me?! There's something in him. Or maybe there's nothing... Maybe it's just me. It's all in my head. But deep in my soul I believe I can... ...I can help him be a better man. It helps me make sense of myself... ...in this wilderness. It's what keeps me going. I don't know if this is love, Father... or it's just my survival instinct. But it feels like if he were gone... ...I wouldn't have a reason to wake up in the morning. I'm afraid what I'm feeling is a sin... ... and that maybe I need God's forgivness so that nothing bad happens to him... ...and they can make it back safely. Turica! We need you! When I deserted from the army in '41, I hid here. In this shack. It's almost like I'm at home here... This place has gone to hell, too, just like everything else. Then why are you staying with us? You think these guys are like the ones I was running away from in '41? They have eyes and ears everywhere, dammit. They're something else. I'd get worse now than before. Let's move. Emil! Emil, help ! Emil! Bazan! Bazan! Here, Bazan! Where are you, fucking communist asshole?! Where the fuck are you? Help me, Emil! Take him out, Bazan! Now! He said two or three days. They just left! What do you want from me? Listen, Fritz! Don't you get it? A woman doesn't need this to know things. She only needs this! I'll leave at dawn. We're leaving now. I think it's broken. C'mon, Jonas! Hurry up! Wait up! We're going together, aren't we?! - There's no time to waste! - Do you know the way? Yes! That's not right! We need to head North! C'mon! Walk! You'll get us lost, Agnes! Don't be stubborn. Follow me! We need to go West. Jump! Anyone knows where we're going? Not even the Secret Police will find us here! I'm sorry about Turica... But it's not my fault that you two are having problems. You'd better shut up. - This path doesn't lead anywhere. - Have you ever trusted a woman? What a question! We're wasting our time. We'll never find them. They've surely reached the village. You go back and tell that to Turica. I can do it alone. Jonas! Jonas! Jonas?! Jonas! Jonas... Alone? Come spring, I'm leaving. I'm taking you with me. - Good morning. - God bless. Where are you coming from? How did you get here? We came from where we've always come. - Nobody stopped you on the way? - Who's there to stop us? This has been our way since the beginning of time. Have you found others like us? - C'mon, give me the rings. - Hand them over. My good man! - My good man! - What? Give me your necklace. - Give it to him. - C'mon, give him the necklace. Give it to me. - C'mon! - Are you done, yet?! - Don't be like that... - Take this one too, my good man. Just give us a little one. What d'you think? Why not, right? Grab one. That one! Take it. God bless! No pity for the enemies of the people and of the socialist revolution! The fight to expose and punish all subversive elements must be intensified... Since when do we believe what they write in their paper? I know them very well... The truth is even worse. Listen to me! We have to focus on our lives here! Next year we could build a house for Ion and Ana. You'll have other children soon enough, right? So you can have somewhere to raise them. Why don't YOU have children to raise in this god-forsaken place?! Ion!... Ion! We're not leaving here! When you're not afraid anymore here, that means you're truly free. What do you still have to lose? What are you still afraid of? God bless. Can you take this one back? You're too precious to do it yourself? Listen... Why don't you ask for a house for yourself? Won't be long now until you need one, right? C'mon, lunch is almost ready. - What's wrong? - Leave me alone. Sit down here. Leave me alone! I'll fetch you some water. I haven't done anything wrong. I was alone. I'm sorry. - And I'm so scared. - Why? I don't want to lose it. I need you, Ana. What are you staring at? When are we starting our own house? How can you go with him? Why? Maybe it's our fate... It's how you found what you were looking for. And how these people started to believe in you. You're now a free man, Emil. This little island here is YOUR freedom. Ours! I know it's not Paris, but... ...have we ever really felt this free? It's been 256 days since I last touched a book. What's my purpose here? Forgive me... Come on! Move! Into the valley, let's go! I'm not coming. I'd be a burden. Take this with you. Write them and tell them about us. It's the only way the world can find out what happened here. It's a good thing you learned some French. You promise? I swear it! I'll be waiting. Are you sure? Well... Wait for me! Turica... I'm fine... ...and I hope you are too. These French people are something else. They speak so fast that I can't understand anything . It's nice here. The people are happy... ...they sing... ...they have fun... ...we laugh all day. Wait for me. I won't be long. I'll drag these Frenchmen all the way to Baragan, and we'll get you out. Wait for me! You're always in my mind, Turica. Wait for me and we'll see Paris together! Wait for me! Wait for me! Wait for me! Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Dear Lord, receive your daughter Dumitra into Thy kingdom, and forgive her all her sins, those commited willingly and those unwillingly... Five years later Monster! There's a monster! Restriction of motion from the previously designated area is hereby lifted for the following individuals: Jonas Friedl... Dumitra Bazan...

You have 24 hours to pack. A truck will come to pick you up tomorrow. Is it clear? Our island was gone. After us, other islands were formed, and they'd continue to appear and disappear, just like ours: Budapest '56, Prague '68... Gdansk, Berlin, Bucharest '89, and so on... So, what's freedom? I'll expect your answers... ...next time, please. Yes? Prague '68: TheCommunist Party of Czechoslovakia will use any means to develop such forms of political life to ensure freedom of...
