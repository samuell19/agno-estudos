One day I'll build a bank so big, Wells Fargo'll wet their britches. And you know what? What, father? I'm gonna put your mother's name on it in big letters. Daisy Childress Bank and Trust. What does the trust part mean? Means you can trust Daisy Childress. To spend all your money soon as it hits the bank. Well, I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves, but I don't find that humorous at all. Believe me darlin', neither would the customers. Maybe we'll just name it after you, Will. Good idea. I'm still mad at you. It's a big job, Daisy, I can't just... You promised no more business trips this year. We have plenty of money, Rusty, there's no need to up and run across the country every time the wind blows. I'm having fun. Thank you, son. And hey, I got to bring you two along for once, right? I'm trying to build something special, Daisy. That means there's gonna have to be a few sacrifices along the way. Well, let's just hope your family's not the next thing sacrificed upon the altar of success. You knew what you were gettin' into when you married me. I know. But I thought you'd slow down and all you've done is work harder and longer ever since the day we met. And I've provided a very nice life for you, have I not? Yes, you have. But money ain't everything, Rusty. You just work and work and work. And I'm proud of you, I am, but I'm just afraid that one day you may... What, I may what? I don't know. I guess I'm afraid one day you may just leave us for your first love. You are my first love, Daisy. I don't believe you. I swear it. Then prove it. Stop working and spend some time with us. How could I say no to that face? You two are the reason behind everything that I do. I think you mean the three of us. What? We're having a baby. What? Yeah! All right! Well, I don't see nothin' excitin' about that. Look here, boy. Ain't nothing gonna change between us, all right? Whoa. What's the matter, son? You already work all the time, now I'm never gonna see ya. I just have to get through this year and a couple more jobs and then I promise that we will... All you care about is your work. You're a liar! William! William! Stop right there! Ah! I hate you! No you don't, William. Don't say that. Yes, I do! You're always too busy for me! That's not true! Yes it is! Liar! I gotta work, son! Somebody's gotta work! What do you want from me? I just want you to play with me. I am so sorry. You're right. You know what? We're going home right now and we're gonna spend some time together, okay? Just you and me. What do you want to do? Anything. Just say the word. I wanna start a farm. A what? With lots of animals. Will, I'm a businessman, I don't know anything about farming. You said anything. I did, I did. Well, who's gonna clean up all the dung from these animals? Every morning, evening for the rest of our lives, huh? I don't think so. No, it's not gonna be me. Why don't we get your mother to do it? Okay. Father? Yes, son? I don't hate you. I know, son. What was that? Father? You stay right here. Mother! Stay there! Rusty! Come on, hurry. Danny! Rusty! Hush your mouth, come outta there! Let's go, hurry up! Rusty! Get this horse outta here. Hey! Run, Daisy! Get off of me! No! Please don't do this. He's my son. He's my brother. Please don't shoot. William: No! Get up, son. We gotta get outta here. Will? Get up. Get up, dammit! Will! Daisy! Come on, you sons of bitches! Come on! I'm right here! No. I'm sorry. Hello? Who's there? Shh! Shh! Comanches. - Where? - Shh! Come with me or you die. Dammit! Come on. Don't, no. - I said don't! - Shh. Not good. Bullet is still inside. - Must take out. - No! No, no, no! Although it wasn't invited, this bullet has found a nice warm little home and I reckon it can stay there as long as it likes. Do you understand? Don't be a coward. Watch it, Running Mouth. That is not my name. Oh, that is not my... Well, excuse me, Squats To Pee. Is that better? My name is Lotsee. You're not funny. You're just a coward. Well, that's something. Coming from a damn savage that had us running around for a few hours today. And from what exactly? Comanches? I didn't see any Comanches. Not one Comanche. Nowhere. And I am no coward. You don't know the first thing about me. I know that I just saved your life. I'm glad you think so. Why you on side of road? I don't wanna talk about it. You bury someone. I said shut up! I lost my family, too. The Comanches. What are you, Cherokee? I am Caddo Indian. We are peaceful people. Hunters. Traders. - I was... - Well, hold on a second. Okay, I didn't come here to have a pow-wow with you, okay? Soon as the sun is up I'm gone 'cause I have to find my wife. So, I'm going my way, and you can go your way. You're leaving without me? What the hell else am I supposed to do? I lead the way. No way. You'd get me killed for harboring a redskin. You are lost and wounded. One day's journey from the nearest town. You need me. What's in it for you? You protect me. That's it? And... When we find her, you pay me $100. Do I look like a damn Rockefeller to you? I saw your shoes. You have money. We have deal? Fine. Deal. I ain't shaking your damn hand. Deal. Sorry. We still have deal? Just shut up. That means yes. Okay. We leave at dawn. All right? But if you slow me down one time, or lead me into any danger at all, that's it. No deal. It's off. Agreed. But you have to listen to me. And follow my tracking if you want to find her. No questions. Fine. Now, the bullet. It must come out. I don't know. Tell me your name. Rusty Childress. Why, why, why? In case you die, I can leave note. Hold still. No wait, wait, wait. Rise and shine. That's it, easy now. Tell me, what is your business here? Please don't shoot me, sir. I'm just a weary traveler. My family was attacked yesterday, and as you can see, I was injured. I really mean you no harm. Hey, everything all right, Reverend? - I - believe so, Tucker. Fetch this man some water. He's clearly in need of the service of the Lord. Yes, sir. Had a brother sat down on one of these and blowed his ass clean off his leg. Anyway, I was asked to lay hands on him. It was just not a pretty sight. I'm Reverend Phillips. Who might you be? My name's Rusty Childress. Tucker, where is that water? If he don't bleed to death, he gon' die of thirst. Now, who are you again? And speak up, I'm old as shit. Rusty. Well, Rusty, I want you to know that here at New Life we are here to serve. Tucker, where's the damn water? Oh, you have to pardon my language. The Lord has all of my heart but only about a third of my tongue, and you understand? Say, can I ask you a question? Thank you. Why certainly. Does this mean anything to you? Lenny T. Radcliff. The name sounds familiar, but he ain't part of this congregation, that's for sure. Oh, wait, Radcliff. Like, the outlaw Radcliff family? Lenny, Danny, Simeon, is that who we're talking about? That's who we're talking about, right? No, couldn't be. Well, it could. Yeah, who are they? Nobody you wanna go lookin' for, son. Thieves and murderers. Bandits? 'Bout sums it up. Sounds like the right bunch to me. I need to find 'em. Know where they could be? Well, last I heard, they was over in some saloon out there in Wellington. They running all kinds of illegal stuff through there, but they paid off the owner, so he stays quiet. Yeah. Simeon, I think he's planning on being the next Jesse James, or something. The town's called Wellington? Yeah, you gon' go up to Sabine River, then cross over... Now, hold on a cotton pickin' minute. Don't tell me that you are in cahoots with those boys. No, sir. Good, 'cause there are a few things I do not tolerate here and that's liars, and thieves, and... I got food! Redskins! You know this redskin? No. I mean, well, yes, but I can explain. Rusty? You want me sex them? What? What? What? I have shed countless mercies upon you but this, this I cannot bear! Reverend, please. What on God's green earth are you doing fornicatin' in my church? We weren't fornicatin'! Come on, Reverend, let me take her out back and shoot her. Quiet down, dog. Come on! Let me pump her full of lead. You'll go to hell for that. Everyone, just hold on a minute! Now, Reverend, I know that you do not want blood shed in your church. And I'm more than grateful for your generosity, but I think it's high time that we go. Now, you have my word, if you let us leave here, I will personally take care of this savage. And if she so much as blinks an eye between here and the door, you've got my permission to shoot her yourself. I don't know what you're up to here, but in the name of prudence I must decline your offer. Please. Oh God, she's eatin' me! She's eatin' me! What the hell was that? Had to be sure you wont leave without me. All right, listen. Keep your head down, when I start shootin', you make a run for it. Should I go now? Stinkin' savage! Get ready to meet your maker, boy. No, no, hey, stop it! Excuse me. Well, glory. You're still a coward. You're still a savage. What you doing? Just trying to keep my shoes clean. Okay, this way. No, this way. No, it's this way. It's gotta be. Wellington's out west, over the river. Look at the sun. I thought you knew these routes? Yes, yes, it is on western trail. But my people do not take same roads as your people. We must stick to trees. Well, you're with me now. Like I said, we should stick to the trees. You promised not to slow me down or get me into any extra danger and you've managed to do both already before noon. So, just shut your trap and listen to me for a change. It'll do you good. You rich white men! You have money and think you know everything! You are no better or smarter than me. Tell me, how you will catch men on horseback by taking same route on foot? Hm? We must cut through the woods. Now... That way. Ah! Okay, listen, I'm done here. So you can either follow me down this here trail, or just get yourself lost. And that's final. Do not be coward! I am not a coward! Damn savage. White men so slow. I'm starting to think it would be faster to walk on road. I really hate you. Shh. Listen. You hear that? No, my ears are bleeding. What is it? Water. What? Can't be. There's no way we covered that much ground already. I don't believe it. Water. You drink like savage. Oh really? Do not do that again. Got you. Oh, careful now. You could really hurt somebody with that. Look! Gator! What, what's going on? You all right? What in God's name? Oh, come here. Were you eating these? You trying to kill yourself? What is it? Pokeberries. How many have you had? How many? Nine or ten. Nine or ten? Well, well, well, what do we have here? We gotta get you up. Now. Y'all going for a swim this afternoon? Nah, found her like this. She ate pokeberries. And what you plan on doing with that there Comanche? Her? Nah, she's a Caddo Indian. I'm just trying to trade her back to her people for a little money, that's all. Now, why in the world would a Caddo Indian eat pokeberries for? She suicidal? Just an honest mistake. That's bullshit. A Caddo would know better. Now, let me tell ya a little bit about what I do. These fellas here are my disciples and we have taken it upon ourselves to cleanse this cursed land by ridding it of niggers and savages and anyone else who isn't white or don't believe in white power. Which is good news for you. Why's that? Well, you're white ain't you? Yeah. Not so good for her, though. I'm gon' give ya the money you want for that savage. Take her off your hands for ya. I don't know what to say. He don't know what to say. He don't know what to say! Thank you would be a mighty fine start. All right, enough talk. Go fetch her, boys. Whoa, wait, hold on. How much you got in there? A lot more than she's worth, I guarantee you that. How much? There's almost $2 in there. No, that's not enough. What? I was told they'd give me at least five for her. You lying. No. I'm telling you, she's really somethin' special in her tribe. She's young, smart, tough. She's worth more. And yeah, she's just a filthy savage. But white or not, there is no denying her natural form. You starting to act like you got feelings for this savage. That's not it, believe me. She's done nothin' but cause me misery since the moment I laid eyes on her. But I can't allow you to have her for a measly $2. I was actually thinking about asking her tribe for much more. I don't know, maybe some food and fur to go along with the trade. All right, so what do you want for her? Well... I'd say you give me $10. And your horse. Or I just as soon be on my way with her. I see what you're doing. You do? Oh, I got you pegged. You do? Yeah, you're a damn businessman ain't ya? I seen your outfit, now I've heard your sales pitch. You're a damn businessman trying to make a deal. Dammit, boy, you almost had me. You had me believing she was a Queen of Sheba there for a minute. Hell, I was about ready to give you my damn house and kids for her. That's a good one, Billy. Hey, don't you say my name. Sorry. Hell. Guess it don't matter now. Well, Mr. businessman, I bet you didn't know it, but I drive a pretty hard bargain myself. Now how's this for ya? I'm gonna give you what's in that bag for that savage, and you're gonna take it. Or else my boys here are gonna throw your ass to the gators and I'll just take her for free. So what's it gonna be? Money? Or gators? Well, if those are my only two options, I guess I'll have to go with the money. And gators. Hey! Swim! You know the next step now, boys. If you sold her to me you'd be done with it. She ain't for sale. Damn shame. You sticking up for them other races. Don't you know you're better than them? Guess not. Blow that son of a bitch up. Now listen. Hold on, guys. Hold on. All right. You can have her. I'm sorry. Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, now. Hold on now. This has gotten way too far. Now, come on now. You ain't gonna kill me, are ya? No. But they might. Rusty! You're a dead man! Rusty! I got you. Come on. Come on. I hear what you say back there. It was nothing. It was kind. Yeah, well, I had to say something to save your sorry hide. Still see me as a coward? Do you still see me as savage? We did it. I'm coming, Daisy! I'm coming! Hey! This corpse's making me thirsty. I'm so tired of cooking for all of these people! Watch out below! Oh, you're full of it, man. This is our chance. Let's go, come on. No, no, no, we don't need any extra attention. Here, get in. Here you go. What now? I'm gonna go in there and get my wife back. And then the three of us are gettin' the hell outta here, that's what. And then I'm gonna get us squared up, okay? You were right, I couldn't have done this without you, Lotsee. Thank you. Time to set the world straight again. Wish me luck. Are you stayin' the night? Well, you here to look around or do you want a drink? Whiskey. I told you not to sell my babies. Oh, come on, they're just chickens. They're my babies. Did you hear anything? Just the sound of my poor little heart breaking. Oh fine, Ginger, fine, I'll go get your damn chickens. Shoulda sold your ass instead, you devil woman. Say, I'm here to see Lenny T. Radcliff. Lenny? Hey, what's the hold up? Shut up, Tig! I haven't seen his dumbass in two days. I have seen his brother, though. About 30 minutes ago, headed upstairs with one of my whores. Thanks. Hey, hey, hey! Oh, yeah. Of course. Hey, wait a minute! You can't just mosey on up there! Hi, you want any chocolate? I'm playing blind man's bluff. You can be on my team. Shh. No, stop. Please get off of me. Let me go. Daisy? Who in the blue blazes are you? I'm sorry, I was looking for someone else. Now look what you done. We were just getting formerly acquainted. Lenny, is that you? Help! You said you was lookin' for someone. My wife and Lenny Radcliff. You know him? No. Can't say that I do. What does this Lenny feller have to do with your wife, anyway? He kidnapped her. Lord have mercy. Just what do you aim to do if you finally catch up on him? Every ounce in me wants to lay him down the way he did my son. I don't think you know who you're messin' with, mister. Simeon, come quick! You don't go nowhere. Better get going before she has my hide. Please not go. Here. For you. Thank you. Hey, mama, I'm over here! No, no, quiet. Please. - Oh my Lord! - Somebody stop her! Oh, brother! Thank God you're here. Shut up, will you? And listen to me. There's a man upstairs that aims to kill you. He says that you took his wife. No. That ain't true? Can't be. Well, then there's a damn ghost up in my room. It's true. I took her. We got attacked by Comanches. We had to split up. Damn near skinned me alive. Well, he's here. Where? He's still up in my... Get him! Lotsee! Get a rope! She tried to take my little girl. Shoot the savage! - No. - do it No. No. No. Stop, stop. Stop! Don't shoot, she's my friend! I promise I will not hurt you. Thank you. Rusty! Where do you think you're going? What are you gonna do? Where's my wife? Where is she? They took her. Who? The Comanches. She's dead by now. No! I begged you not to kill my boy I begged you. I'd do it again. Get him, Cole! Rusty! Rusty! Jump! Rusty! Jump! You not speak a word since we leave town. Is it your wife. Is she... I have been thinking. Maybe you are better without me. I slow you down. I do not want to cause any trouble. I will go. Stay. Please. I want to leave. Where's this coming from? You made me a deal. You can't just... You can't back out like that. I changed my mind. I don't want your money. I need you! No. When I first met you, I didn't like you. Hell, I couldn't stand you. But you got to me, dammit. And you do all these little things that... Well, they just get so deep under my skin. But for some reason I can't even imagine you not being there when I find Daisy. Truth be told, I really like having you around. We are not the same. Our people, different. I know. I used to think that mattered. It is all that matters. White men do not hate me. How can they? They do not know me. They only hate my skin. It's not that different on the other side either. I know. Fear and hate come in many colors. So what are you saying? I'm not following you. You're too different to lead the way anymore? No. For the first time, I feel too much the same. What is that supposed to mean? Talk to me about your family. All right. My little boy, William, he loved his daddy something fierce, I can tell ya that. I swear if I said to him the sun is blue, he'd say the sun is blue. Just wanted to grow up and be a man as soon as he could. And my wife Daisy, she's a hard one. She's tough as nails. Like a mustang that hasn't been broke yet. Most times we're fightin' like the dickens, but I reckon we'll be all right. She's got a good heart. She's strong. Beautiful. A lot like you. Rusty? I'm sorry. I can't do this. Rusty, I... I need to be alone. Just promise me you won't leave. I'll never find her of you go. Promise me. Why? Please. Lord. I can't do this without you. You gotta do something. Help me. Please. Where are you? Hello? Lotsee? Who's there? Help me. Please. Please. What happened to you? Comanches. Comanches? She tricked me. She led me straight to 'em. Who? An Indian girl. You're okay, you're okay. They tortured me. And they killed several others. How'd you escape? A few nights ago, they got into a fight with another tribe and I slipped away. Hey, hey, hey. All right, you're okay. You're okay, come on, hey. Hey, hey, come one, come on. All right, listen. - Come on, breathe. - I need water. I'm sorry, I don't have any. I'm really sorry. What's your name? Rusty. Rusty, listen to me. Don't you go there. Don't you dare go on their land. It's No Man's Land. Come on, stay with me, stay. Listen, hey. Come on, come on. What was her name? The Indian girl? I don't know. She had marks here on her neck. She had one for every man she killed. She fooled me. She fooled me. Where you go? Why did you eat those pokeberries? - What? - You heard me, dammit. Why'd you eat the berries? It was a mistake. Don't you lie to me. You're a Comanche! You're trying to lure me to the slaughter, huh? No Man's Land? Ah, no! Ah! Why? Why? I want to help you. You're a liar. You're leading me right to 'em, aren't you? Aren't you? Speak up, savage, speak up! I was there. What? The day they take your wife. What? I hear shots. So I follow sound and hide in trees. I see what happened. You saw the whole thing? My people use me and other women to curse white men. I lied to you. I trick you. I push you. But you were not like others. You protect me. You care for me. You save my life. I change my mind. Please, forgive me. Let me help you. Get up. Slowly. Rusty. Don't say another word. - Listen... - Shut your mouth, savage! Tomorrow I'm going to No Man's Land and you're gonna take me. I will not. Which way is it? You cannot go there! I have to. - Why? - They have my wife! Listen to me. Tomorrow will be full moon. A Comanche moon. You will never make it out alive. There will be many, many Comanche warriors sacrificing and killing white men. And your wife, she... What? What about my wife? What will happen to her? If she lucky, she already dead. I'll reason with them. I got money. And horses. - And all... - You cannot reason with them. I have to save my wife. You cannot! I have to. You will die, Rusty! I am sorry. No you're not. Get out of my sight. - Rusty. - Go! A full day's journey along western trail. When you come to creek, follow downstream. You will see the fires. I better never see your face again. Rusty! No, he's my son! No! Come on, you sons of bitches! Come on! Father. Will. You okay? Yes, father. I'm here to make sure you're okay. I'm okay as long as I'm with you. I can't stay long. Why, baby? Please don't miss me, father. I can't help it, son. I just wish I'd spent more time with you. Just remember this, don't let fear control you. Have faith and take heart, the battle is already won. I love you father. I love you. Will. Will. William. Oh no. Whoa. You done mighty fine. Now, just wait right here for me, would ya? Daisy. Daisy! Daisy. Rusty? Daisy! Daisy. Oh. - Oh my God. - They killed our baby. I never thought I'd see you again. I got you. I never thought I'd see you again. I was so scared, Rusty. I just prayed and prayed and prayed. And I thought that you... Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm gonna get you outta here, darlin'. I gotta a horse waitin' in the woods. Just hold real still for one minute. Rusty. Rusty, look! Where's the horse? Where's the horse? Daisy, look at me. They're gonna find us. They're gonna come and they're gonna kill us. Look at me. You're with me now. I'll never let you outta my sight again. I promise. I trust you. Good. Then let's go home. All right, this way. Don't come any closer. - Father. - Will. Just remember this, don't let fear control you. Have faith and take heart, the battle is already won. I love you, father. Happy to see me? What are you doing? Fighting for what is right. A white man? A family? You betray your people! No! I love my people. But our people not always right. He teach me that. Now he my people, too. Ah! Lotsee! Ah! No, no. Listen to me, there is no time. Just hang in there, okay? You cannot save me. Lotsee, don't say that. Go. No. We're not leaving you here. Thank you for being my friend. You're not coward. No. I'm savage. They're getting closer, Rusty. Go. Daisy? Darlin'? Daisy? Hi. Hi, son. I love you. I love you. Hey, baby.
