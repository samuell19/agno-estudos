Alex, this way! Come on! Hurry. Get in and don't come out. Daniel, I'm scared. Shh. Daniel, please. They're trying to kill me. Please help me. Daniel, please. He's in here. No, no, no! God, no! No, Charles! Stop! - Helene! - No, please, stop it! No! Charles! No. No. Charles. No, please. Please, stop. Please. No. You don't have to do this. Daniel, I'm so proud of you. Please, listen to... You don't have to do this. Nothing's gonna happen. Helene! Helene, please just talk to them. Helene! Please, no! No! No, please! No! To have and to hold. From this day forward. For better, for worse. For richer, for poorer. In sickness, and in health. Till death do us part. And even though your family is richer than God, intimidates the hell out of me... your dad definitely hates me, and your alcoholic brother keeps hitting on me... I honestly can't wait to be a part of your moderately fucked-up family. "Moderately"? That's pretty generous. - Hi. - Hey. Holy shit! You look perfect. What're you doing? You smoking? In my old room? Give me that. We should get down there. Your dad looks like he's at a funeral. - He hates me. - No. He doesn't hate you, Grace. He thinks I'm after your money. Well, I mean, that's true. Yeah. - You just gotta give it time... - So mean! What? No, it's true. Honey, just give it time. Okay? - Okay. - Okay? We sprung this on them. - Yeah. - They're used to a three-year courtship. And not what we did. The, I don't know, 18-month... Bone-a-thon. "Bone-a-thon"? Okay. Yeah. - We should put that in the vows. - I did. - Oh, good. - Mm-hmm. Anyway, who cares what they think? They're horrible people. Well, I-I care what they think. Because they are the family of the man that I love. And I want them to accept me. Are you okay? 'Cause I'm nervous enough as it is. No, it's not that. I just... Without you, I'm... - One of us. - Hey. - Daniel. - I've been sent to fetch you. ♪ Here comes the groom shitting his pants ♪ ♪ He cannot believe - ♪ That his entire life is over ♪ - Daniel, you fuck. Stop it. I'm gonna let you go in three, two... release. Take it easy. It's not too late to flee, you know. You don't belong in this family. I mean that as a compliment. Okay. Well, if you're still determined to be a Le Domas, then would you please get yourselves outside. Okay? Congratulations, you fuckface. Thank you. I can't believe that in half an hour... I will be a part of the Le Domas gaming... dynasty? Empire? "Dominion." We prefer "dominion." - "Dominion." - Yeah. But... Um... You know, Daniel's right. We could just... leave. Oh, sure, yeah. "Thanks for the presents. Go fuck yourselves." No. I'm serious, I'm serious, honey. I'm giving you an out. Right now. No, thank you. I'm all the way in. Are you ready for this? Oh, fuck no. Smile, please. He could've done so much better. You're just saying that because he's your favorite. Oh, please. I love all of you... equally. Two years is a long time, Alex. I started to think we'd really lost you. Smile. Smile, please. The more natural the better. Okay, that's good. Don't take it personally. They're just trying to figure out if you're a gold-digging whore. You know, like my wife. To the left. She's pretty enough, in a "last call at the dive bar" kinda way. But she'll never be one of us. Of course not, dear. She has a soul. Where the hell's your sister? I'm sure it's Fitch's fault. He's useless. But he's one of us. Is Grace? There you are. Hi! Hi. - Give me a hand. - Oh. Okay. It's a beautiful case, wow. Thank you. It was my mother's. Do you smoke? Oh, no. Nervous? Ah. Because your blood isn't blue enough? They said the same thing about me. They did? Stand tall and fuck 'em. The only thing that matters is what Alex thinks. And that we know. - I love you. - I love you. I have something? Oh, shit. Shh. Do you remember anything that happened today? It's a goddamn blur. - But I'm pretty sure... - Yeah. - Did we get married? - We got married. Are you my wife? - Holy shit. Holy fucking shit. - Yes. You're my husband! Oh, my God. Shit. Oh, babe. - Babe. - Hey. It's hard with this thing. - I know. Listen. - Hold me. - I have to tell you something... - Mm-mm. Shut up. Take your pants off. No, I have to tell you something. - Grace, honey. - I'm taking 'em off. Holy shit! Holy shit. Someone's here. What? Jesus, Aunt Helene! Can you give us a minute? You'll have to hide better than that. We're not fucking hiding, obviously. Everyone is waiting. Yeah, we'll be down in a few minutes. - I'm sorry, honey. - What the hell was that? That's my aunt Helene. She has, um... well, she has boundary issues. Yeah. Of course you have a secret door. It's a servant's corridor. They run all through the house. Um, sorry, who's waiting? That's what I was trying to tell you. Um... So, at midnight you have to play a game. It's just something we do when someone new joins the family. - A game? - Yeah. What game? I don't know. Uh, you draw a card. Could be backgammon, croquet, checkers, for all I know. I know. I know. It's stupid. It's a little weird. Why, exactly? I guess, because we made our money in games, it's part of the initiation. - Do I have to win? - No. You just... you just have to play. - And then... - And then you... you are officially part of the family. Honestly, it means more to them than the wedding itself. - That's it? - Yeah, that's it. I know it's ridiculous. It's just a weird family ritual. And we only have to do it once. All right? Okay. - Yeah. - Okay. If it gets your family to accept me, I will play the shit out... of checkers. - I'm really good at it. - Okay. Okay. You go buy me ten minutes 'cause I gotta put on... my game face. - I see what you did there. Very good. - Right. Okay. So, uh, I'll meet you downstairs. Music room. Ah. Yes. A totally normal room to have in a house. Just... It is just downstairs. It's your second door on the right. Okay. I thought I might find you here. I'm sure Mr. Le Bail is with us today. So, how much have you told her? Nothing. And I never will. Tomorrow we're gone. If she pulls that card, are you prepared to do what's necessary? Excuse me, whatever you wanna say, get on with it please. You better hurry your ass up and get here before midnight. Call me when you get this message. Dora, two more, please. - Grace, darling. - Hi. - Your vows were beautiful. - Oh. Thank you. Alex didn't tell us you were brought up in foster homes. Not that he tells us anything these days. Champagne? Oh. Thank you. Thanks. My foster parents were great people. And, you know, they did what they could. But it was always temporary. I always sort of dreamed of having a... a family. I mean, I'm sure Alex would've loved living in sin forever. I don't doubt it. But he, um, he really understood how important it was for me to... finally have a real, permanent family. And I just don't wanna let you down. Grace. When I first saw you, I said to Tony: "Finally. One of our children has brought home a good one." And you don't know how grateful we are that you brought Alex back to us. But please... try to bring him back into the fold. We're his family. I promise. Oh, sweetheart. I knew you would. Oh! - Hey. - Hi! Mom, I'm just gonna steal her away. Okay? Mmm. - Hi. - Hi. What'd she say to you? Oh, she's so sweet. Did she say anything? No. No. All right. Are you okay? Did something happen? Yeah, no. I just, I don't feel very well. Well, if you wanna lie down, can't we just play the game tomorrow? - No, no, it has to be tonight. - Hands up! - Kill, kill, kill! Kill, kill, kill! - No! No! - Hey! - Get him, Georgie! Whoo! We made it, Daddy. Take it off, now! - Daddy? - You just keep on playing there, buddy. Oh, you're so tense. - Le Bail's gonna get you. - Asshole. - Kill, kill! - Mr. Le Bail! You. Lady in white. Look at this, you must be the bride. - Hi. - Fitch Bradley. Grace. Pleasure. - Alex. - Hi, Fitch. How are you? Well done. Sorry we cut it so close. We couldn't get our regular charter out of de Gaulle this morning. And I cannot fly commercial anymore, right? - It's the worst. You understand. - Grace! Hi! - Hi! - I'm Emilie. Oh, my God, your dress is amazing! I've been totally stalking you on Instagram. Oh, really? That's... We're gonna be best friends. Hi. Nice to see you. I'm so excited to be a part of your family. Me too, me too! He will decide that, my dear. Aunt Helene. It's nice to see you. Brown-haired niece. You continue to exist. Ladies and gentlemen, it is 11:55. This is gonna blow your mind. Oh, okay. So this room is reserved for family members only. After you, my dear. Holy shit. Great-Grandfather enjoyed his games. Grace. Have a seat. Do you like to play games? Um, I guess it depends on what we're playing. Well, we'll know in a moment. I gather you've noticed our family is big on tradition. And now, well, now the time has come for you to join us in those traditions. Ooh. Story time. As you may know, my great-grandfather, Victor, set up a modest printing shop during the Civil War, manufacturing playing cards. A generation later, my grandfather expanded into sporting goods and board games. Under my leadership, Le Domas Family Games acquired four professional sports teams and reached, well, even greater heights. Some may call it luck, but, well, it's a little more than that. You know, it's almost as if someone's watching over us. It all began with a very generous benefactor. And this box. You see, originally, Great-Grandfather was a merchant seaman. It was a hard life. And, like so many, he wanted more. On one of his many excursions abroad, Great-Grandfather came to meet a Mr. Le Bail. He was a... He was a passenger aboard the ship. A collector, of sorts. Purchasing exotic antiquities to resell to wealthy Americans. After discovering a mutual passion for games of chance, they passed a great many hours playing cards. And among Mr. Le Bail's possessions was... that box. And one evening, after indulging in more than their fair ration of rum... Mr. Le Bail proposed a wager. If Great-Grandfather could solve the mystery of the box before arriving at port, Mr. Le Bail would finance any endeavor of Grandfather's choosing. Well... Great-Grandfather whiled away the long hours at sea studying the box. Until finally... And since that time... whenever the Le Domases are presented with a new addition to the family... we place a blank playing card into the box. Our initiate then has the privilege of drawing the card, and Mr. Le Bail will tell us which game to play. I got chess. I got Old Maid. Seriously, what the fuck is Old Maid? Fitch... So I just take out the card? My dear, it is your turn. What does it say, girl? Oh. It says... It says, "hide and seek." Are we really gonna play that? Everything okay? Uh... Yeah. Yeah. Those are the rules. Hide and seek, right, Dad? Yes, indeed. Those are the rules. Okay, so, uh, who... who hides and who seeks? Well, it's your initiation, my dear. You get to be the one to, uh, to hide. Of course. This is gonna be fun, honey. Yeah, just come meet me in my room, okay? - No, I wanna play for real. This is so weird. - No, no. I know. Um, so, to Mister... Le Bail. To Mr. Le Bail. - To Mr. Le Bail. - To Mr. Le Bail. The rules are simple. You can hide anywhere inside the house. We then count to 100 and try to, um... well, find you. Well, don't you think you have a little bit of an advantage? Oh. No, no. We never use the cameras. We always play the games as they would've been played in Great-Grandfather's time. Always. So, there's no way for me to win, right? Well, you could, I mean, stay hidden till dawn. - No, thank you. - No. We're gonna start the count just as soon as you leave, okay? Okay. Grace, good luck. Who wants to play a game?

Alex, honey, do you want some company? Oh, fuck me. How long is this gonna take? How long does this usually take? There is nothing usual about this. It's only happened once since I joined the family. Am I really supposed to know how to use this thing? Oh, you know what? I'm just gonna make a quick pit stop. I've got a nervous stomach. You know I've never liked you, right? Uh... All right. That's enough of this. Shit. Shit. Oh, shit. Georgie. Georgie. Shh. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Jesus. - I nearly pissed myself. - I know. - You need to listen to me very carefully. - Georgie. - Shit. Come with me. - Wait. What are we doing? - Get down. Grab your dress, grab your dress. - Okay. Jesus. Georgie, I know you're in here. Georg... Over here! Over here, over here! Guys, I found her! I did it! Dad! Daddy, I did it! Look! Daddy, come see what I mean... Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Oh, Jesus Christ. This is Clara. Does she look like she's wearing a giant, white wedding dress, Emilie? Why did you shoot her in the face, sweetheart? You're supposed to maim her. She needs to be alive for the ritual. I don't know. - I heard a shot. - Yeah. Oh. Well, if she dies, does this count? Of course it does not count. It must be the bride. Well, what do we do now? Well, I don't know. I'm... I'm thinking. Clara, hey. It's gonna be okay. Oh, Daniel, could you? Come on, let's take a walk. She's gonna die, guys. Walk it off. So, what do we do with her? Move her. We don't want Grace to see. Give me the fucking lanterns. Okay. Call it. - Heads. - Heads it is. - You get the legs. - Okay. Hold on. It's slipping. Yeah, good. Oh, good. Okay. Go. She was my favorite. Wait here. Don't move. Okay, sweetie, you gotta get up. We gotta get you out of here right now. Okay. Stand up, here we go. Okay. Okay, grab... grab your phone. Grab the keys. Fuck. Shit. Okay. Stevens must've taken the phone, so... - Alex, what the fuck? - You're gonna have to run, okay? Hide and seek. You pulled the one bad card. They think... They think they have to kill you before sunrise. - What the fuck? - Follow me. One sec! I forgot my gun. Okay. Okay, girl, no more fuckups. - You're a winner. - You got that? - Okay, you have your shoes? - Alex. Honey, I need you to put on your shoes. No, Alex, Alex, what the fuck is going on? I need you to put your shoes on. Right now. Okay, here we go. Here we go. Okay. They think that if they don't kill you, something very bad will happen to the family. Now... I had to play along so that I can get you out. But the house is on lock down right now, so it's gonna be really tricky. You knew what would happen if I pulled that card. - I didn't think they'd actually go through with it. - Fucking knew! No one ever pulls that. It never fucking happens. - Yeah, but you knew about it! - No, no, I didn't. - I'm Richard Babis. - And I'm Charlie. And today's segment is called "Getting to know your crossbow." Oh, fuck. I really... I thought it was safe. But if I didn't pull a card at all, then... Then your crazy family wouldn't be trying to... - Oh, my God, they're gonna kill me. - No, then we'd both be dead. When you marry into this family you have to play a game. And if you don't, you die. I know that sounds crazy, but you have to believe me, it is real. It happened to my great-uncle. He got married, he didn't play a game, next morning he died. His wife too. Same thing happened to my cousin Rachel. Same thing happened to a bunch of people that I never even met before. You just... You have to play. You said your family was... fucked-up, - but you didn't say psycho killers. - I know. - You... you brought me here, you didn't warn me. - You wanted to get married. - So it's my fucking fault? - No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - Are you fucking serious? - Shh. - We could've eloped. - I know. - We could've... - No, no. There are rules. You can't just elope. You... you have to have the wedding here, and you have to play the fucking game. You didn't even fucking talk to me. You could've told me. We could've... - Just... - If I told you, you would've left. And if I didn't propose, you would've left. You're everything to me, and I promise you I'm gonna get you out of here, okay? All right? So just listen to me. You just need to go straight down this hallway until you get to the service kitchen. I'm gonna go down to the security room. I'm gonna unlock all the doors. I'm gonna unlock all the doors. - No. Don't fucking leave me. - Then you just fucking run. I have to. Honey, I have to. Just... just stay inside the walls until you get to the kit... Hey. Hey. You can do this. Where you going? Straight and then, um, kitchen. To the kitchen. Good. Good. Hey. Hey. You're gonna make it. It's gonna be okay. - I love you. - I love you. Go. Go. Okay. Fuck. Okay. Fuck. Oh, hey. Any sign of her? No. She could be anywhere. Found her. Jesus! Fuck! Goddammit! Emilie, aim for the center of gravity! I don't know what I'm doing! Help, help, help, help. Fuck. Shh. I just came to get a drink. I have to call the others. No, you don't. No. You can help me. Please. This doesn't end well for you. I just don't wanna be the one to serve you up. Daniel, I'm begging you. I'm really sorry about all this. It's true what they say: The rich really are different. I'll give you a ten-second head start. Daniel. One, one thousand. Two, one thousand. Two and a half, one thousand. She's in the study! Point the weapon away from you. You lost her? Indeed. You're pathetic. Indeed. Could you at least pretend to care? Oh, I'm sure you'll find her and kill her with or without my help. You know, something did occur to me, though. Alex may have been wrong to keep Grace in the dark... but do you remember how you reacted when I told you about this? You didn't fucking blink. I mean, you couldn't wait to sign your soul away. You know where I came from and what my life was like before. I'd rather be dead than lose all of this. Well... from your lips. - Where is she? - I'm afraid you just missed her. Tony, Alex got out. I'm so sorry. Goddammit. Who's the fuckup now, right? Still me? Did you find her? Is it over? No, it's not over. And now she knows what's going on. Oh, but Emilie shot Clara in the face. So she's dead. That's just a side note. Clara's dead? She was my favorite. Cock! I forgot my gun. Daddy, I forgot my gun. I suck. - Oh, it's okay. - I suck! You don't suck, sweetheart. Here, hon, why don't you just use mine. Mr. Le Domas, Mr. Le Domas, I just saw her running... - Oh, my God! - Oh, my God. - Okay, now... - Why does this always happen to me? - Come on! - Okay. Calm down. Baby. - Yeah, okay, that's okay, honey. Come on. - Don't be mad. Let's go take a walk, find you an edible, even you out a little bit. Maybe we'll find the other one that's still alive to clean that shit up. So, wait. Does the help count? No! Why does everyone keep asking that? We must... We must... Oh, what the fuck! We must kill the bride by dawn. We're fucked. I mean, we are so fucked. Calm down. Work the problem. We should use the security cameras. You have no respect for tradition. No, she's right. Don't you think Great-Grandfather would've used the security cameras if he had them? I mean, it's not tradition that he was born before cameras. That's... that's stupid. Exactly. Times change. Speaking of which, may I please use a weapon made this century? - I have a gun in my purse. - You do? No. No. We use Great-Grandfather's. That's tradition. You pick and choose. Pick and choose. At least you're not making us wear those fucking masks. Oh, no. That was Dad's idea. It was the '80s. - Our reverence must not wane. - Goddammit, Sis! If we don't find her and perform the ritual before dawn, we're all dead. Tony, take Daniel and turn on the cameras. Everyone else fan out, and somebody find Alex. Jesus. Fucking shit. Fuck. Come on, Alex. Monitors. Monitors. Okay. Oh, shit. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Your aunt always gets lost in the details. Who gives a shit how we find her? Oh. I agree completely. Yeah. - Looks like we're not the only ones. - What? Someone turned on the cameras. Alex. Open doors. Open fucking doors. Oh, fuck. Move. I'm afraid I can't do that. The ammunition is display only. Now, did you really think I would be stupid enough to... Fuck yeah! Open the door, Alex! She's in here! Open the goddamn door! Goddammit, Alex! Open this door! No, no. Hey, no! If you're not gonna help us, get the hell out. You fucking leave her alone! You understand me? - Alex! - That's my wife! Hey. Alex. Alex, you don't have to do this. Alex. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God. I know, I know. - I know. - You gotta help me. You gotta help me. - She's everything to me. - I know. We'll get her out. - Okay, thank you. Please. - I promise. - Whose side are you on? - I distracted him, didn't I? Call it. Oh, fucking who cares? Tails. You take the head. Goddammit. - Wait, wait. I gotta get my gun. - Just come back for it. Move your ass! I'm carrying the heavy part, Father. Years of alcohol and drug abuse have taken a toll. - Oh, my God. - Oh, my God. - I don't understand what's going on. - Okay. Okay. I need you to be quiet, okay? Look, I'm not even a maid. Mr. Le Domas, he just likes the way I dance. Okay, let's swap places. Yeah, cause they're looking for me, they're not looking for you. So, come on. Come on. - Please. - She's over here! - She's here! She's over here! - No, no, no, no. - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. - Ow, ow, ow! Help me, please. - Shit. - Please. Shit. - Tony. - Yeah? - What are you doing? - Well... We're trying to bring him back to us. Sir. Oh, man. Ow. I was unable to repair the security system. The doors and windows remain unlocked. Oh. And I'm afraid that Dora has been crushed, sir. By the dumbwaiter. And then there were none. Jesus Christ. She's taking us all out. - How's she doing this? - Sweetheart. It doesn't make sense, Becky. - She's a little blonde twig, and I don't... - Tony. Take a minute. But just a minute. We can't let her get out. We've got to guard the doors. He lost his way. You should never have let him leave us. Excuse me? He and I have always been so much alike. I knew the girl would draw that card, and that he would face the same choice I faced. Horse shit. None of us expected to be doing this tonight. I got a tee time at eight. And, in case you didn't notice, it wasn't much of a choice for him. He's been helping her from the get-go. - He hates us. - No. He's simply afraid of who he truly is. Like I was. You'll never know how it felt that night to be told that the only man that I'd ever loved had to die. But I should not have fought it. I should have killed Charles myself. There's still time for Alex to do the right thing. He only has to accept the truth. Uh, um, what truth is that? That he is meant to lead this family, not run from it. He's hated our pact from the very start. He's the good son. Do you remember that? Then why is he the only one of us who has ever seen Mr. Le Bail in his chair? Good God. He was five. He was probably, I don't know, dreaming it. Or maybe he made it up. Well, if you say so. "What up, dawg?" Idiot. Not much. Family shit. Georgie? Oh, thank God. Okay. Okay, listen, I know this is really, really scary, but... Fuck. Shit. Fuck. Fuck. You little fucker! I got you. I got you, bitch. Fuck! She's outside, running towards the north fence. I'll get the others. Help me! Please help! Help. Please help me. Help! Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Help! Wait, stop. Please, please help me. Oh, thank God. Thank you, thank you. - Get the fuck out of the road. - Please wait. What the fuck is wrong with you? You fucking animal. You piece of shit, little, tiny dick-licker, fucking asshole, fucking I... Fucking rich people. Fuck. She must've gone into the woods. But don't worry, sir, she won't get far. I'll find her. And I'll fix the fence tomorrow. Well... she's out. Well... this was fun. What do you say we, uh, divvy up the wedding gifts at brunch tomorrow? Do you think that this is a fucking game? Yes. Hide and seek, remember? Do you realize that if she lives till dawn, that we're all gonna die? You all remember what happened to the Van Horns, right? Um... didn't they just die in a house fire? Yeah, that's what the press told you, but they... You don't wanna know how they really died. Trust me. No, you don't fuck Mr. Le Bail. Mr. Le Bail fucks you. You couldn't have negotiated better terms, huh, Vic? You couldn't have, uh... Oh, I don't know, maybe talked him down on the whole eradication clause? Well, here's to you, fucker, because now we are all fucking fucked! I think you made your point, sweetheart, thank you. Oh, holy dick. Go wait for Stevens. He might need your help. Not you two. I want you out of the way. Take the maids to the goat pit. And, pumpkin, try not to kill anyone else. Cleanup duty for the fuckups. - No. Daddy. - Come on, Em. Listen to your mother. Hey, hey. So, at what point do we just cut and run? Right? I mean, come on. Right? Fuck you. Daniel! Daniel, help! Grace. Grace. Why did she have to pull "hide and seek"? Do you think it's real? What? That we'll implode or burst into flames, or whatever, if we don't kill her? I don't know. Can you... All right, I'll... - I need, I need you to... - I can't. If you barf, I'll barf. One, two, three. Three. But you were with them the last time they played hide and seek, weren't you? Were you six, seven? Do you remember anything? I remember all of it. Alex was with me too. I tried to protect him. I don't know what he saw or what he remembers. You always looked out for him. If that were true, I wouldn't have let him marry Grace. He deserved a better brother. And we all deserve to die. My kids don't. Mommy? Honey! Georgie. Are you okay? What are you doing out here? I... I followed that lady down here, and I shot her with that gun I found. Why would you do that? That's what everyone else was trying to do. Oh, sweetie. I am so proud of you. Shit. Come here, Grace! Fucking asshole! You motherfucker. Thank you for calling Trip Safe. Please stay on the line and you'll be connected to the next available representative. Good evening. This is Justin. Your call may be monitored... People are trying to kill me. Can you please help me? Uh, yes, I can help you with that. Um, do you need medical assistance, or... Can you call the police, please? Yes. I'd be happy to help you with that. Sorry. The computer's acting up again. Let me just quickly reboot here. Justin, just call the fucking police. Ma'am, it says here that the car was reported stolen. I'm sorry, but I have to shut it down. No, what? No, what the fuck? Are you fucking kidding me? It's company policy, ma'am. - There's nothing I can do. - No, no, no, please. Justin. Just stay with the vehicle, ma'am. Police are on their way. Just start the fucking car! - 'Kay, there's no need for profanity. - Start the car, Justin! Jesus, there's nothing I can do. My hands are tied. Justin. Hello? Justin! Is there anything else I can help you with? Yeah, you can go fuck yourself, Justin! Okay. Thanks for using Trip Safe. Have a great night. Okay. You're okay, you're okay, you're okay. Police are on the way. Police are on their way. Everything's gonna be... Good night, Grace. Alex, is that you? Hey. Hey, you're safe now. We're leaving. Where are you? We're approaching the rear gate, sir. We'll be there shortly. All right. We are back in business. Tony. Hey, Stevens! Look behind you. Stevens! Turn down the fucking music, you idiot! Oh. Oh! Oh, no. Oh, fuck. Fuck! Déjà vu. It's funny, I... came out here to escape the madness. Thanks for crashing a car into my tranquility. Daniel. You don't wanna kill me. You don't want me to die. No, I don't. I like you, Grace. So let me go. Okay? I'm weak. You're a good guy. You're a really, really, really good guy. And Alex, Alex loves you. And you love him. He's not gonna forgive you if you do this. Maybe not. But at least he'll be alive. I can't let my entire family die because of you. It's insane. Can't you see it's insane? No one's gonna die... No one, no one is gonna die. And you can do something about it. It's bullshit! No. I am not who you think I am. Alex is the one who got out. If anyone was gonna save you, it would've been him. You can come out now. What, you knew I was here? I'm drunk, I'm not blind. Ooh, we gotta move. Less than an hour till dawn. And we still need to prepare her for the ritual. Where's Grace? She's indisposed. You didn't think I was just gonna let it happen, did you? With family, one hopes for the best. The thing is... I like her. I don't wanna do this. But we have to protect the family. If she dies... I'll kill you. Well... then I suppose I'm dead either way. Yeah, and maybe it's a crock of shit and nothing will happen. Oh, please. If you believed that, you wouldn't have let her draw a card at all. Why did you leave us, Alex? Oh, I don't know, Mom. I don't know. Maybe one night when I was chanting and slicing the throat of a goat, it occurred to me that that wasn't a completely normal thing to do. But, and this is what scared me the most... it felt normal. It did. And I realized that you'll do pretty much anything... if your family says it's okay. And then I met Grace. She's the opposite of all of you. She's good. And she made me feel like I could be good too. So, if it comes down to you or her, I choose her. I don't believe you. And I don't think that you believe that a girl that you've known for a year and a half... knows you better than I do. Our family has a very special friend named Mr. Le Bail. Mr. Le Bail is the reason we have all the nice things we have. But sometimes Mr. Le Bail wants something from us in return. You got this, Fitch. You got this, Fitch! Don't be a bitch, Fitch. Don't be a bitch, Fitch. You got this, bitch. I know tonight didn't go as planned. But I'll make it right, Mr. Le Bail. You'll see. We renew our pledge this night, as our ancestors before us... with this offering of living flesh and blood. Hail... Brother! Poisoned! You son of a bitch! Oh, God. What did you give us? Stuff we poured on the maids. White bottle, little red cap. Hydrochloric acid! Come on, up and at 'em. Grace! - Did you... Did you just kill 'em? - No, I just gave them a nip. I Googled it. They'll shit weird for a week, but they'll be fine. - Don't worry, I'll get Alex out too. - Find them! We don't have... I knew you'd help me. I didn't. All I knew was, at some point, somebody had to burn it all down. Never thought it'd be me. Daniel. Get out of the way. Charity. You really don't care if I die. You don't have to... Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Go. Thank you. Thank you. Where do you think you're going, bitch? Who the fuck do you think you are? Our family's weathered worse than you. You're just another sacrifice. You're another goat. Fuck the altar. I'm gonna do it right here. Grace? Daniel. Daniel. Daniel. Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Look at me. Oh, my God. Hey, hey, look at me. In my defense, it's been a while. Don't go. Don't go, okay? Daniel, don't go! Don't go! I need you, Daniel! Don't go! I meant what I said this morning. I thought you were gonna be the new me. But I'm not gonna let you hurt my family! You can die. You don't deserve a family. Fuck your family. Fuck your fucking family! Grace. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry too. Daniel's dead. You won't be with me after this, will you? Alex... Alex. Alex. - You're hurting me. - She's in here! No, please, no, no! Please! Let me go! Attaboy. Oh, Becky. Oh. The sun is about to rise! We must do it now! It is time for your boys to take their place. Deliver us, O mighty one, from all past error and delusion. That, having set our foot upon the path of darkness, we may not weaken in our resolve. But, with thy assistance, grow in wisdom and strength. Shemhameforash! Shemhameforash. Shemhameforash. Shemhameforash. Shemhameforash! Shemhameforash! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan! Hail Satan. No. It is lost. Forgive us. Um... nothing's happening. I knew it. I fucking knew it. It's all bullshit. Grace. Um... so, what... What should we do about her?
