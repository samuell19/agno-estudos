[all] International love and pride. You could be dead, man. Pushups. Parker! Get ready. I'm ever ready for some lightweight shit. So, you better come with something heavy and packed with dynamite. Huh. Hai. Hooaa. Aah. 'Block this.' Aah! [music from radio] Oh. Now, man, I told you what the policy of the station is. Bostick, says my job is to play records. And, man, he ain't about to let me make no announcements about the activities of this organization. Frankie, I've known you since our first year at Central State. You were honorary in class, or of the whole damn campus for that matter. And now you're gonna come up water in your veins because of a jive radio station owner? Yeah, boss. [laughing] My money is low, staff volunteering. And the landlord wants me out. The people around here need this place. 'You know, you can make that announcement' and tell Bostick to kiss your ass 'if you put your mind to it.' You know something, Charles? You're a funny talking dude sometimes. [instrumental music] [tires screeching] [male #2] 'When they told you I hadn't been home in 27 years.' 'I saw all that meat on the table.' 'I thought to beat you to death myself' I'd have been home every day eating these dried hamburgers made out of whole hog. Now you must be anemic. Are you sick? You haven't been home in 27 years and they save the ham each year and the turkey. I would've spend two days trying to eat it all up. [music on radio] [man on radio] 'Sorry, but I got to leave you sisters and brothers.' Frankie J. Parker. The "J" is for joy 'cause that's what you get from Frankie J.

[telephone ringing] Frankie J. show. Oh, hello, Mr. Bostick. I'm sorry, but he left already, Mr. Bostick. I swear, he did, Mr. Bostick. Yes, Mr. Bostick. I will, Mr. Bostick. Goodbye, Mr. Bostick. Phew, one of these days you're gonna wear that man's patience down and find yourself on the streets without a job. Gloria, if that day ever comes the women of this town will burn this radio station down. What's on the agenda for tomorrow? At 10:00 a.m. you're to speak to the students at Carver High School. Then, you're to help Mr. Atkins at the NCL center. 'Oh, yeah. Reverend Johnson called.' He wants you to speak at his church on the fourth Sunday. Yeah. Church must be in some heavy trouble, huh? You can tell him it's cool. Show him and his congregation what paradise is. Give him a touch of paradise right here on earth. Mmm, yeah. How does that hit you, Gloria? I think you're beginning to believe your own bullshit. [laughing] Later, baby. [laughing] [instrumental music] How you doin', baby? - Hi. - Hiya, baby. - Hey, man, how you doin'? - Good to see you. Alright. [music continues] [crowd clapping] Thank you, thank you, thank you. I would like to mention that we have with us tonight in the club, the joy man from KJLA, Frankie J. [crowd cheering] Well, what are you gonna do about me? I'm gonna do what I've been doin'. And that's nothin'. No, honey. Your eyes have been following me all over this joint. Maybe, it's because you walk funny. Then you're a freak for a funny walker. Anyway, I did hear you on radio today. If you were listening to my show then you had an experience. I produce, write and direct my own material for both radio and television. With the chip chap profundity of an angel interspersed with the best music played on the FCC airwaves. And the FCC has got to check with me because I own the sky. Would you mind repeating that for me? Mister Landlord of the Sky? I can dig it, miss? Melinda, Melinda Lewis. Hey, that's some cigarette case you got there, can I-- I didn't say you could sit. I'm sittin' because you're a lady from another town. 'You don't know anybody.' You're beautiful and I'm beautiful. So, it's only natural we would gravitate toward each other. How did you know I was from another place? Brilliant mind perceptionist, that's what I am. Just another one of things that makes me so special. I don't believe you. And I don't think you're fool enough to believe yourself. Alright, so I'm funny. Let's go. - Where to? - Party. You ever hear of Tank Robinson? Tank owns this club. And he owns and runs Oregon Records and he used to be ace football player. So you're up on football too. Next thing you gonna get hip to is Frankie J. Parker Don of the Universe. Is there anything you haven't been or done? I haven't made love to you. Yes you have. In your dreams. You're a funny lady, Miss Melinda. Look, Tank is havin' this party on a boat. 'So let's do it, huh?' Okay, Mr. Frankie. But that's all we're gonna do. Alright. Allow me. [jazz music] [music continues] Thank you. [car revving] - You got a motor, Melinda? - No, I like it here. [car revving] I put some FJPP in my tank today. Makes the car the toughest thing rolling on the freeway. - FJPP? - Frankie J. Parker Power. Now, feel it, momma. [tires screeching] [laughing] Wait a minute.. So, so I was sitting there watching this nigger, black, standing up over me with his right hand deep off into his pocket like he's gonna come out of it with something big. Well, I wouldn't even think about him. I just told him to get outta my office. He said, Tank.. ...you ain't too big or too rich to get your ass kicked. [crowd laughing] So I said, if you ever dream you gonna kick my ass they gonna call you peg leg the rest of your natural life. [Tank] 'Frankie.' How you doin, babe? Look who I found to bring here. Miss Melinda Lewis, Tank. My goodness, you're looking good. [instrumental music] You got a scar right here, you know that? - No, it's a birthmark. - Mm-hmm. And you can't kiss it away. - Ah-ha. - Huh-uh. - That's always gonna be here. - Forever. - Champagne cocktail for you. - Thank you. - Scotch. - Scotch on the rocks for you. - Here's to it. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers, to you. You have a beautiful boat, Mr. Robinson. Well, thank you very much. I've done alright by myself. I made it up in my mind the day I signed the proof with Balder I was gonna play it safe. I was gonna make all the bread I could make in the game, before some new lowlife could pull my leg off. I was gonna quit. And own a piece of this world. Look around you, Miss Melinda. Go on, look around you. I own a piece of this world. Yeah but I'm prettier. Alright. Alright. I'll drink to that. [instrumental music] There. That oughta give you something to think about. Sullivan tells me he sent you a birthday present and you sent it back. He's just thrilled.. I never tried to buy anything for you. That gift was from my heart. The only thing wrong with that is that one of these days.. ...I might find myself in front of some investigating committee. Trying to prove what a big heart Tank Robinson's got. Only to discover, he had a transplant with the heart of midget. Well, I guess I'll go check out some of these strange people at my party. - Hi, Tank. - Okay, baby. - Who's the girl, Frank? - Somebody I met tonight. Takin' her home with you tonight, hmm? Look, Terry. I'm not going through any of your shit tonight. You just think about that tomorrow when the sun hits you. Yeah. Look here, Terry. I gave you something I've never given anyone. - You have? - My time, baby. Time nobody else in the world could get from me but you. But what you want is some weak-kneed faggot you could manipulate. 'Now I can't cut that.' So, why don't we just leave it, huh? You don't fuck with meand I won't fuck with you. Hey, Frankie. You know, you bring this fine woman up here and she gets intellectual on me. Now, ain't that a bitch. A black woman getting intellectual on a nigger rich as me. Stop it. Later, Tank. - See you tomorrow. - Yeah. [car revving] Well, welcome to my little piece of the world, Miss Melinda. Walk on in, lady. And make yourself at home. Some music, Miss Melinda. [instrumental music] Glad I met somebody finally who can appreciate a fire. 'I love a fireplace.' - How 'bout a drink? - No. - No champagne cocktail? - No, thank you. Well, uh, you make yourself at home, Miss Melinda. And I'll be right back, in a minute. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [Melinda] Aah! [Melinda moaning] [Melinda panting] [car engine revving] [tires screeching] At your service, ma'am. Where to now? I don't know. - 'I'm not that bad. Am I?' - 'You're not that good either.' [Frankie] 'I don't know about that.' It's all about involvement, ain't it? 'Thirty four years to build this thing.' For the people. Beautiful, huh? You better turn that mike up. [laughing] - What are you doing? - What? What do you want for dinner? You know something? What? I am so with all of this. I'm really enjoying myself. It's the joy I bring, baby. You got more in it than that, Frankie. You know it. You're right. Yeah, it's to do with where your mind is at. An evolvement. That's how people should enjoy each other. It's like some hidden nerve that suddenly cracks on itself. Then how can you do anything else but jump up and down with elation. That was that beautiful thing we went through last night. You know when I met you at Tank's last night I just had to find out if there was something else other than jive time. Behind that false exterior you're so in love with. M-m-wah. How'd I make out? It was, say, heavy. Deep. Like Frankie. That's the way you ought to think about yourself. Deep and heavy. God knows the world is too full of hustlers and pimps, freaks. Just plain old-fashioned losers. Anyways, nice to run into some soul for a change. And you've had 'em all, huh? Every last one of them. I have a.. ...real feeling for you, Melinda. And I don't make a practice of getting too deep with women. I get burnt too quick. 'Hmm.' [instrumental music] - 'Who is it?' - Frankie J. Parker, please. [phone buzzes] - Yeah. - Frankie? It's me, baby. Fantastic. Your phone's been ringing ever since you left here. - You listen to my show? - You better believe it. Look, baby, I, uh, I've gotta go tape my television show when I finish up here. - Okay. - Love. I love you too. Bye.

We got a real mess in here. The girl butchered to death. What's her name? Mel.. ...Melinda. - Melinda Lewis. - He's lying. Identification here says her name's Audrey Miller. Some of our men paid a visit to that hotel. The girl's room has been ransacked from top to bottom. Now come on, a strange girl with no name. You're the only one that's been with her. Now who else could've killed her but you? I told you, man. I got nothing to say till my lawyer gets here. You call me "officer." You know, I wouldn't wish this job on my mother-in-law. Let me get a word with this gentleman here. How you doing there, Frankie J.? Hanging tough for tomorrow. They messed with you, huh? Yeah, sometimes they get carried away with their jobs. But they ain't bad. They're really nice fellows. It's the way the job goes, you know. Hey. Know something. I saw a man one time slap a jackass on his back with a whip. And that jackass reared up on his back legs run across the field. And run back to his master to be slapped again. And saying, "One more time, daddy." [laughing] That's a good one. A walkin', -talkin' jackass. Jackass! You black son of a bitch. Your lawyers are out there with a writ. You can go now. [chair clatters] Goodbye. Nigger! [jazz music] Frankie. Hey, baby. Look, man, thanks for, uh.. ...them lawyers you sent down to get me out of the joint. The pig-ass motherfuckin' cops are crazy, baby. Look, don't sweat it. Anytime I can help a brother out you know where I'm at. Come on into the den. Somebody there who wants to see you. Oh, yeah. I'll be back as soon as I cool off this bitch I got up in my bedroom. You look tired. You're in trouble. 'Cause you had to lie down in bed with that pretty face. Is that what you came here to tell me? Look, if for some freaky reason I still feel there is something deep between us let us not forget there's been something wrong. You see, I happen to feel that there's something very powerful about being a woman. If I'm here because I love you.. ...doesn't mean that I have to let you shit on me again. [soft music] You wanna tell me about it? All I know is that for the last two days somebody's-- [Davis] 'Forget it, Frankie.' Some crazy pervert killed that girl, that's all. Now, my manager will take care of your case. You ain't got nothing to worry about. Who was this girl? Where did she come from? What was she doing here? Don't you know anything about her? All I knew was that she was from Chicago. I don't know if it was her they were out to get or me. But if somebody is out there.. ...tryin' to knock me off I'll be dammed if I'm gonna just leave myself wide open to be kicked in the head by a bunch of sick motherfuckers. Who would chop a girl up the way they did. Hey. Hey, hey. Oh shit! [honking] - Could you help me, please? - What's the trouble? My car won't start and I just twisted my ankle. Shit! [engine sputtering] It's your starter, baby. What you need is a mechanic. Hey, but wait. I've gotta get downtown in a hurry. Will you take me? I'll pay you. Wow! You will? You better get on in this car, lady before somebody else grabs you. Please now be careful now, you wanna be careful now. Come on. Here you go. Here we are. Yes, ma'am. That's lovely. I'll be right around the other side, ma'am. Are you all ready to go now, ma'am? This way here. My name is Marcia, by the way. Frankie, ma'am. Well look here. Pistol-packing bitch. You just keep driving and do what I tell you to do. Where we going? I said we go where and when I say. Now drive, mister. [tires screech] [Frankie] Hey, hey, come on. Shit. Alright, girl. Who sent you after me? I don't know anything to tell you. Now look. Now I am in no mood to be gentle today, woman. You better tell me something and tell me quick. What're you gonna do, hit me? Go ahead. Hit me. I don't care. Aah! I didn't wanna go after you. They made me do it. Who, "they", goddamn it? Who? I've got this problem. The problem is to keep myself looking like a woman. To keep myself alive. That's your problem. You're a junkie. There's this friend of mine. And he's always got me straight whenever I needed the stuff. I got real sick the other night and I went to my friend. But he refused me. He told me to die. And that scared the shit out of me. So I told him I'd do anything. And he took me to this black guy, Smith. And Smith sent me after you. He said you have something of his he had to have. He didn't say what it was. Just to bring you to him. And he'd do the rest. They mention a girl called Melinda Louise or Audrey Miller? No. Where you supposed to be taking me? I can't tell you that. I don't care what you do. I can't tell you. Aah! [slaps] [slaps] Aah! [slap] Ah! Stop! I'll tell you. Okay. I-I, I was to take you to my friend's house. ...0-0-6 Romney Street. What? 4-0-0-6 Romney Street. That's where Smith is. Wait. What's gonna happen to me? You can go to hell. But they'll kill me. I just know they will. Everyone's gotta die, bitch. All I can think about is living. That's all I got to do is live.

They sent him to me because I gotta do him favors sometimes. 'This keeps my business goin', man.' Who? It's just business, man. I never met him. [groans] Did they kill that girl? I don't know nothing about nobody getting killed, man. [groans] He said the girl ran away with something that belonged to him. - And that she gave it to you. - Where's Smith now? [groans] 'He split when the girl that he sent after you didn't show up.' I don't know where he's staying, if he's coming back. I swear I don't. What good is your swears? You're a dead person. - 'Operator' - Yeah, police headquarters. Hello, police? You come to 4-0-0-6 Romney Street. You come to 4006 Romney Street. Motherfucker. What is it? That girl.. ...she's inside there dead. - What? - You said you'd be here. I was! But there was no answer. The house was locked tight. I was worried, so I went to the gas station to call Tank. - Tank? - Yes. [Davis] 'As you bend down keep your leg straight.' And place your hands up on the ball. Now spread your legs just a little bit now. - Like this, Tank? - Right. That's it. Now, when you feel I have the ball in my hands then you have got to be able to receive your assignment from the opposing line. - Okay. - Alright. Now on four. Set, hike.. ...one two three three and a half, four. [screams] [telephone ringing] Hello. What? Where? Now wait a minute, Frankie. Wait my ass! You were the only one who knew I was using your pad. What are you talkin' about? Terry knew and uh, your old school buddy, uh...Charles. Is that his name? He called me and I told him you were there. Frankie? [Frankie] No good. I can see the cops got my place covered. Why don't we go to my place? We could figure somethin' out. Won't work. Sure they'll check you out. I know what. Tinecia, my editor, she's in New York for a week. We can stay there. Yeah, alright. Don't sweat it too hard. Too much of that emotional rigmarole could kill you. Did I ever tell you about the woman.. ...who was always goin' to meet this man.. ...and he was always goin' somewhere else? The whole trip, became so involved.. ...crushed a nerve in her mind. You know what was wrong with both of them? All they ever did was give each other.. ....their weakness. That's what kills people. Here. I gotta get some air, baby. [soul music] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [grunts] You have got to be Smith! And I'm gonna kick your ass! You gonna tell me things you don't even know you knew! [man groaning] Stop! Talk! [giggling] Now, we're goin' to the bedroom. [knocking on door] Oh shit! Wait a minute, baby. Don't go away. Be right back. What the hell are you doin' here? [groans] You gotta help me, Tank. I ran into Frankie J. tonight. Looks like you ran into a tractor to me, man. Tank, that man's crazy. I had to tell him some things. You had to tell him some things? I had to tell him some things or he mighta killed me. So, you come here to me because you're scared shit of what Gregg will do to you? Tank! Dirty.. ...low-life bastard! What the fuck are you screaming about? I-I'm losing my patience with you, Frankie. Ah! Did he tell you what he told me about you? [Tank] 'I don't care what he told you.' I'm in business, man. I gotta deal with all kind of people. People who go around chopping up girls? No, no. I didn't have anything to do with those girls getting killed. Frank, I don't wanna hurt you.Nobody wants to hurt you. 'But the way you've been going at this thing' 'it's like a man out of his head.' Aah! What is it I've got that they want, Tank? I don't know, Frankie. I swear I don't know. Who is Mitch, Tank? - I.. - Who the fuck is Mitch? Mitch is my partner. He owns this club. He owns everything. So you helped them kill that girl? No, no. I didn't even see that girl until you brought her to the party. I swear, Frankie, I.. Argh! [groaning] Why did they kill her, Tank? She was Mitch's girl. She took somethin' that belonged to him. I-I don't know what these people are after. I swear, Frankie. I swear. No wonder, so many running backs got by you. You were always hidin'. You were never there, motherfucker! You mean to tell me, you're gonna make those men think you have what they're looking for? That's dumb, Frankie. That's the only way I'm gonna stay alive, baby. 'As long as they think I got their merchandise.' Then they're gonna have to deal with me. What kind of dealin' can you do with a bunch of killers? You have no choices, Frankie. Go to the police or somethin'. But don't play a stupid game with those men and get yourself killed.. ...over some...party bitch. Oh no! Oh, I should be sorry I said that. I love myself too much for that. If I want you, I want you for me. If I need you, I need you for me. If you put me in that bed and fuck me.. ...I want it to be me. And not some dead broad you had just for two nights. Hell no! I'm not sorry, Frankie Parker. It'll be morning soon. I know how you feel, baby. I can appreciate it. And if my head ain't cool, then we'll get through that too. That girl...Melinda.. ...to live with that man. White man. She must've been in an awful lot of pain to run off away from it the way she did. Yeah. [moaning] [echoing laughter] [female screaming] Please, please.. [laughing] Why did he have to kill her? Mitch, I'm sorry. I mean, it couldn't be helped. She brought up such a fight, she was yelling and screaming. Couldn't take the chance of her going to the police afterwards. Anyway, he did find out that she passed the bank note to the disc jockey. And you're sure it's in this bank? It couldn't be any other place. Mitch, what are we gonna do about Tank? For the moment I think he might be of some use to us. I want you to get him to me as soon as we find out what's going on in the bank. Are you sure nobody in the bank can be bought? No, I tried, but those bank clerks are freaky bastards. Well...we'll see! Well, yes, Miss Miller did rent a box from us.. ...but I'm sorry, sir, I can't possibly let you into it. But she left it here for me. Now look, sir, I'm the owner of Mid Century Enterprises. You saw those. Miss Miller works for me as an assistant. The package she put into your bank is the property of the company. I flew all the way from Chicago for it. I can see your credentials are in order, sir.. ...but I'm afraid, even if you had the key to the deposit box I couldn't possibly accommodate you. No one can get into that box but Miss Miller. I see. Is Miss Miller still in town? Of course not. If she was, you think I'd be here having you to break my balls? Sorry, sir. Bank policy is bank policy! Good day! Sooner or later this Frankie guy's gonna come up with that key and figure out some way to get into that box. I want you to put two men outside here doing bank hours. Will do, Mitch. You're gonna get me fired from my job yet, Frankie J. Don't worry about it, baby. When I get back to the office.. ...besides making Bostick give you a raise I'm gonna let you sit on my knee now and then. I pick the knees I sit on! This is it. Ahem. If, uh, you just give me one more day I'll work it out. Look, I just got off the phone with Mitch in Chicago. His hands are starting to shake. You can't kill any more people, Gregg. - I'll...I'll talk to Mitch. - No. No more talk. Talk's all over. Well, if you'll just tell me what it is you're looking for. What's wrong with you, Tank? Look. I just want you to do what I tell you to do. Okay? Huh? Ray, my stomach's killing me. Will you give me those pills? You know, Tank, I'm beginning to believe what people say about you. Do you know what they say about you? No. They say that underneath all that muscle.. ...that you're nothing but a big black chicken. Huh? Is that true? I don't even have to take that kind of put down from Pickham. Thank you. Thank you. I never knew you had a nerve problem too. Gotta have your doctor.. ...to prescribe you some of those pills. Mitch. How ya been, Tank? Oh, it's good to see you. It's been a long time. It's good to see you, Mitch. It's a surprise. - Oh is it a pleasant surprise? - You betcha! I-I spoke to your brother before I left Chicago. He told me to tell you everything is cool on his end. Look, Mitch. When I borrowed that money from you the deal was strictly legit. It didn't say anything about my doing the kind of things Gregg has been asking me to do. But we are friends. And I am your business partner, right? Yes. Well that's the way things are, Tank. I can't help that.. '...and neither can you.' Now.. ...you know this disc jockey real well. You just tell me everything about him. 'Where his weak spot is.' 'Who he loves and who he hates.' I promise you, we'll make his legs bend just enough so tears will flow from his eyes. And he will voluntarily help us clear this mess up. Then I won't have to turn Gregg loose on him. - Okay, Tank? - Okay, Mitch. Gregg. Your man Smith told that jockey too much last night. He knows a lot about my business with that union election incident, doesn't he? Yes. Why? He makes me nervous. Find some excuse to send him to Kansas City. And give Roger a call to shower him with a warm reception when he gets there. You understand what I'm talking about, Gregg? Look, Mitch, Smith is one of my most valuable men. He's a butcher! His orders were to get that package. He killed Audrey for nothing. You send him to Roger, Gregg. Sure, Mitch. [telephone ringing] Black Velvet Publications. Excuse me, Burt. [telephone ringing] - Was there anything in the box? - Yeah. Only one problem with it. This is a bank deposit box key. Right. And I can't get into that box. 'Nobody can but her, and she's dead.' Let's face it, baby. I'm fast becoming a loser. [telephone ringing] - Do you still have her license? - Yes. - Give it to me. - What? I said, give it to me, Frankie. Please. - What's the license for? - Audrey Miller is not dead. And she has this license to prove it. 'And you're thinking about--' Going to the bank. That's right. You know how much time you get in jail for defrauding a bank? Time, Frankie Parker, is merely a measurement between here and there, between now and tomorrow. And life and death. - Yes? - Miller. Miss Audrey Miller. - Thank you, Miss Miller. - You're welcome. Yes, would you please sign here where the X is. Oh, I don't quiet get this, but I.. No, it's just a statement in your own handwriting testifying to the fact that you're not dead. - Well I'm not dead. - You're not dead. Thanks. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Uh, now, may I see your identification please? - Thank you. - Welcome. Um, would you excuse me a moment please? Sure. [door buzzing] - Miss Miller. - Hello. Well, Miss Miller. I see you're back in town. Oh, yes. I was, uh...I was in Rome a couple of days. - Oh? - You oughta try it sometime. Well, now, Miss Miller, have you any.. ...any other identification besides your driver's license? Well, isn't that enough? Well, you see, it's an out of state license and the bank requires something local with your name on it. Hmm. Well, I see from your car rental receipt you're staying at the Central City Motor Inn. Yes. Mary, would you get me the Central City Motor Inn please? Thank you. Uh, Central City Motor Inn? This is Mr. Hawthorne from the Western Bankers Trust. 'I'd like to verify a tenant staying at your motel.' Mm-hmm. Thank you. Uh, this won't take long. She'll be right back, she said. I don't give a damn if she never comes back. Now look, I'm getting sick and tired of this. 'I walk in here and you treat me like I'm some damn crook.' - Miss Miller, what's wrong? - What's wrong? What's wrong, my ass. You know what's wrong. If I was a white woman walking in to get into my deposit box I wouldn't have to go through half this shit! - Hey, shush! - "Shush," my ass, bitch! Now look, I want my fuckin' property or I'mma burn this bank down. Now, Miss Miller, there's no need to get excited. Look, I don't wanna hear it. Just take me to my stuff! Uh, take her to her box, Miss Brown. Yeah. [slurping] Oh my god! Those people in the bank scared the shit outta me. Yeah. But you did it, baby. You did it. Hold that. I don't understand this. Maybe she gave it to you as a gift. No, nothing like that. 'It says on it, "From Mitch to Audrey."' This is solid gold, baby. There's gotta be more than just a cigarette case. I know. But what? Even if I wanted to go to the police, this wouldn't help me. I am gonna do one thing though. - What? - I'm gonna give it back to him. But on my own terms. [siren wailing] Marshall...Higgins...Mayfield. Smith, you've had quite a few names in your day, old buddy. That second job you did on the white girl out at Robinson's beach house was so messy you left your prints all over the place. Now are we gonna stay here all night or are you gonna give me your statement now so we can all get a good night's rest? [woman screaming] Pick up that phone or I put my foot in your face. Call your man and tell him I've got his package. But if he wants it, he has to meet me on my own ground. Hello, Mitch. This is Tank. He says he'll meet you, but, in his own territory. You tell him to be at Ferguson's flat in one hour.. ...or I'm going to the cops. He says, to meet him at Ferguson's flat in one hour.. ...or he goes to the cops. Gregg! Gregg! Do what I told you to do. You got one hour. And Gregg.. I kind of fudged things up for you in LA. I know what he has. Well, I shouldn't have taken on that union job. I did need the money. But the scope of it was too much. Little ego man at the top of my brain wouldn't go to sleep. Why did Audrey turn on me? Got an hour, Mitch. No answers for you. [men chattering] Gentlemen, if you please. [crowd cheering on screen] I'm not going to be afraid of any press of force and finance. because they know I'm going to win this election. [crowd cheering] The only thing to fear is the job that's ahead of me when I'm fighting it as president of this great international union of ours! [crowd cheering] 'No matter how hard that job is, it's going to be done!' 'Do you hear me?' [crowd cheering on screen] I'm not looking to be the first black president of our union. I'm going to be the first president who represents black and white and only sees a member's card! - Oh, yeah. - He's looking for trouble. Really? And I'm going to be president.. [gunshots] There was your almost successful black union man, gentlemen. Uh, he'll no longer trouble you. And there's my faceless, little weak, desperate man. My loser. My dispensable fool without a motive. Now he too is dead by the clockwork of my plan. [chaotic clamor on screen] A perfect execution. That's what it was. And I masterminded and orchestrated it all. I just wanted to show you gentlemen exactly what you have paid for. [bell buzzing] [knocking on door] Yes? [Melinda] 'It's me, Mitch.' I forgot my purse. Sorry, honey. It's done, Mitch. 'Good.' Call Jack. Tell him we'll see this man tomorrow morning at Rome's place. The morning? We don't have to rush now, Gregg. We've got our disc jockey by the balls. [telephone ringing] Hello? No good, Frankie. He won't come to you. - Now listen, you tell him-- - He's got Terry, man. Don't you hurt that woman. Don't you put your fuckin' hands on her. Don't you touch her! Believe me, Frankie, do what he says. This man is not playin'. Okay. Where do I meet him? He'll do it your way, Mitch. I got it. Okay, Mitch. I'm to take you to him tomorrow morning...early. You know, Tank.. ...I'm getting so tired of your shit. I may have to kill you yet. Don't worry, baby. You're gonna win. Listen to me. You're gonna win. I don't know where they'll take him. So I'm gonna have to play this by ear. Which means, you'll have to keep a very close watch on all our movements. Don't worry about it. You just watch yourself. [Charles] 'Good luck. Power to you, Frankie.' Thanks, Charles. I'm gonna need it. [engine revving] [piano music] Good morning. You are Frankie Parker, I'll bet. This is not the best kind of a meeting for two men to have. But we do have some things to talk about. And you will have breakfast with me. Come. Sit. [music continues] You're not gonna join us? I didn't come here to eat no breakfast, man. Where's Terry? I've heard you were a direct man. Cut the bullshit! Give me my woman. I'm sorry, Mr. Parker, you'll have to wait. Ol' Tank wouldn't miss this meal for nothin'. Gregg tells me that Tank would either eat than fuck. [all laughing] And that's sayin' a whole lot. Am I right, big boy? Right, Mitch. Uh please, sir.. ...my friends here are getting nervous. It's beautiful, isn't it? Of course, I've never been able to like this town. It's too...plastic for me. So what do you do? Get on the phone.. ...have people killed from your 30th floor tower in ol' soulful Chicago. You're an arrogant bastard, aren't you? I'm a man that's scared. And madder than your mama's husband. And if I don't see my woman soon.. ...you gonna feel how mad I really am. - You have my cigarette case? - Yes. Hand it over. You'll get your woman. You really think I'm stupid, don't you? I don't have it with me. You have to come and get it. [chuckling] Not me. I'll send my men with you. Where is it? There you go again.. ...underestimating my intelligence. You wait here. [piano music continues] [indistinct chatter] Tank. Where are they keeping Terry, Tank? [Frankie] 'Terry.' Frankie! [snakes rattling] [Terry] 'Please get me out of this thing.' [hissing] Look behind you, Parker. Terry. Frankie, please get me out of here. Please! Take her out of there. No. She stays there. But you keep that picture in your mind of her in there when you go with my men to return my property to me. [snakes rattling] Okay. Let's go! [indistinct chatter] Lieutenant, this is Smith's statement. If you ask me, this is one for the FBI. [telephone ringing] [engine revving] Sure all them motherfuckers are here. Whoa! [intense music] [gunshot] [grunts] [screams] [gunshot] I got it! [engine cranking] [engine revving] 'He's thinking you're lighter.' 'He needs a little more. Give it to him.' One more kick. Watch this. Now watch this. [tires screeching] [engine revving] [tires screeching] [car doors shut] [gunshots] [Terry screaming] No! No, no, no! 'No!' No! Frankie, there's a man with a gun. [grunts] Ah! Ah! Oh. Lord. I'm sorry, Frankie. I'm sorry. I wanna see what's in it. And if you don't show me.. ...I'm gonna feed you to them fuckin' snakes out there. [black labor leader] 'No matter how hard that job is, it's going to be done.' 'Do you hear me?' [static] [indistinct chatter] [Frankie] 'What you didn't know..' ...was that she recorded that thing on a dirty tape. - Now ain't that a bitch. - Yes. That's exactly what it is, mister. [Mitch laughing] [grunts] Hai! Whoa! [grunting] Ah! Hai! Wake up, Mitch! [Charles] 'Frankie! That's enough!' It's all done, Frankie. There's no more to do. [Charles] 'Come on. Let's go.' 'Later, Frankie.' [car door shuts] [engine revving] I sure know how to mess things up, don't I? I won't argue with you on that. Yeah, but.. ...did anybody ever tell you.. ...that you are one mean ass.. ...beautiful, snake charmer? ♪ Love is ♪ A heavy thing baby Come on, baby. Let's go on home.
