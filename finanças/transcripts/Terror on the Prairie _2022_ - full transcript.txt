(dramatic music) (dramatic music) (fire roaring) (electricity crackling) (wind whooshing) (birds chirping) (footsteps shuffling) (birds chirping) (hooves thundering) (footsteps thudding) (hooves thundering) (footsteps thudding) (hooves thundering) (Gideon panting) (footsteps thudding) (hooves thundering) (horse neighing) (Gideon groaning) (Gideon screaming) (hooves thudding) And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth. And that every imagination of the thoughts in his heart was only evil continually. (blow thuds) (Gideon groans) And it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved his heart. (men laughing) (blows thudding) (Gideon groaning) And the Lord said, "I will destroy a man that I have created on the face of the earth. For it repenteth me that I have made them." Book of Genesis 6:5-7. (horse whickering) (men laughing) That's enough. (blows thudding) (men laughing) (gun firing) (horse neighing) I said, that's enough. (wind whistling) I apologize, Gideon. If manners maketh man, I have surrounded myself with boys. (Gideon groaning) You look like you could use a drink. (men laughing) (Gideon groaning) Hey. Do you know who I am? Uh-huh. Then you know why I'm here. (Gideon groaning) (men laughing) Your tears, they do you credit. They show contrition. And I have no doubt that God will forgive you through the blood of his Son. But I ain't God. Go to hell, you son of a bitch. Ooh! (men laughing) Pick him up! (Gideon screaming) Hell, son. Live in it. (Gideon screaming) (men cheering) (wind whooshing) (fire crackling) (Bess crying) It's coming, sweet girl. It's coming. Sh. (wind whistling) (Bess cooing) Rise and shine (Bess cooing) (door squeaking) (wind whistling) (chain rattling) (wind whistling) (footsteps shuffling) (horse whickering) (wind whistling) (Bess cooing) Coffee. Yep, yep, yep. (Bess cooing) Ready? (door thudding) (wind whooshing) (Bess cooing) (dishes rattling) (fire crackling) (fire roaring) (Bess crying) What's going on. What wrong? Hm, want your bed? Be calm. Okay? (water trickling) (Bess cooing) (snake hissing) (Bess crying) Sh, sh. (Bess screaming) Sh, sh! It's okay. It's all right. It's all right. (Bess screaming) (snake rattling) Give me that. (gun thudding) And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Amen. You go hunt down that damn coyote, before we lose any more of our chickens. (wind whistling) Uh, Pa? Can I come hunt with you? Ask your ma. Well, can I? Can I? If you finish your chores. Gotta clean my bed, feed Bess. (wind whistling) What's this? Ma gave it to me. She said you shot a red major clean off his horse at 700 yards. I think she said I could shoot a red major off his horse 700 yards. I can't. Nobody can. But you did kill kill Rebs. It ain't polite conversation, son. You were a sharp shooter? (laughs) I'm still a sharp shooter, boy. Don't you ever forget it. Goodnight. (wind roaring) Hattie McAllister, who would've thought? Grilling pigtails, we used to eat candy and read books in the back of your daddy's store that someday we'd be homesteading this wild country with the best of them. Are we gonna make it out here? Just gotta have a little grit. I don't know where to find that anymore. Sure you do. I know. Deep down, you're the toughest woman in this territory. (wind roaring) (door creaking) (wind whistling) (horse whickering) (hooves thudding) (wind roaring) (chickens clucking) (cow mooing) (wind whistling) (door scraping) (footsteps shuffling) (wind whistling) (woman screaming) (Bess screaming) (man speaking in foreign language) (Bess screaming) (woman screaming) (woman screaming) (man speaking in foreign language) (woman panting) (man speaking in foreign language) (man speaking in foreign language) (horse neighing) (wind whistling) (knife scraping) (drawer scraping) Pa shot that coyote from half mile away. Oh, it was more like 100 yards. Good Lord, Hat. What the hell happened? Ma? (fire crackling) Boy's down. Supper's put away. I'm sorry. They must have wandered off the reservation looking for something. Got no scrap. I want to go home. All right, if you wanna see your folks, reckon I can get a work with the railroad. Buy you a ticket. I don't want a ticket. I want to pack the wagon and take our children out of this God forsaken place. I know it's been hard, but this here's good land. We live in a shack, Jeb. We've got old tools, worn out live stock, and can only feed our children with food borrowed off store credit. I understand it's been tough. But this is our dream, Hattie. This is what we set out to do, build a home on land we can call our own. I want you to ask my daddy for a job. You want us to crawl back to him? We can't make it on our own. Hell, yes, we can. We just gotta keep on going. Well, I can't. (fire crackling) (wind roaring) That's good. I'm gonna ahead into town, grab supplies. Be a strong boy. Look after your mom while I'm in town, won't ya? (wind roaring) (horse whickering) (horse neighing) Here, Pa. (wind roaring) (Jeb whistling) (horse whickering) (wagon rattling) Jeb. Hiyah, go! (whistles) (wind whooshing) (wagon rattling) (birds chirping) (hay rustling) (horse whickering) I think we've earned it. Pa says candy's a real treat, just for Christmas and funerals. When I was a girl in St. Louis, we'd have candy every week. Really? We'd have ice cream in the summer, toffee in the fall and peppermint sticks at Christmas. You would've loved living there. Is it true that Granny and Gramps didn't want you to marry Pa? They just had their own ideas about what they wanted for me. But PA's a hero. He defended Missouri from the Rebs. Your pa was a Reb. He used it to be join up to save the Union. Things weren't simple back then. Will. (birds chirping) (hooves thundering) I might fine morning to you, ma'am. And to you. I wonder if we might trouble you for some of your water. Our mounts are about dried out and we're not much better. Take as much as you like. Much obliged. (chain rattling) Will. (blow thudding) (men laughing) What's the matter with you, son. Didn't your ma teach you any manners? You didn't have no ma, dropped out of a whore and raised by those fur traders, is what I heard. (men laughing) I do apologize, ma'am. We have been in the saddle for about three months now and I'm afraid it is beginning to show. Um, I couldn't help, but notice your coop over yonder, I, I wonder if I might offer to buy some salt pork and maybe a dozen eggs. Fetch as many as you need. Well. I must confess, I, I do feel a bit forward talking business with a lady. Uh, is your husband at home? He ain't here. He gone to town. Oh, well then I guess that makes you the man of the house, I reckon. (horse neighing) (men laughing) Oh, uh, one more thing. Is that a Missouri accent that I detect. St. Louis. I knew it. What a happy coincidence. I am a Cameron man, myself, that big fella over there, he's from Arkansas, but we try not to hold that against it. (men laughing) We don't get many Missourians out this way. No, ma'am, I expect you don't. (horse whickering) I'd be happy to cook you men some breakfast before you go. Well, we would be much obliged. This is very kind of you, ma'am. (footsteps tapping) Those your folks over there, Mrs. Uh? McAllister. McAllister. Hattie. This is Bess and this is Will. Set the table. How old are you? Nine and three quarters. Why then, I reckon that's big enough to wear one of these. (men laughing) This is a lovely home you have here, Mrs. McAllister. Your husband is a lucky man. (Bess cooing) (Bess crying) She wants to talk. (laughs) Oh, now here, allow me. I've held a baby at two in my life. Yeah. You okay? Yeah. (Bess cooing)  Now Dixie forever   She's never at a loss   Down with the eagle   Up with the cross.   We will rally around the flag, boys   We'll rally 'round again   Shout, shout the battle cry of   Freedom  (men laughing)  Now Dixie forever   She's never had a loss  Bess.  Down with the eagle   And up with the cross  Gonna go fetch some eggs.  We will rally round the flag, boys   We'll rally 'round again  Yeah. Come on.  Shout shout   The battle cry of freedom  Hey, Hey. Hey. Is that a Reb song? (Bess squawks) (laughs) Need to teach her that song. You never heard that song before. You like that song? (chickens clucking) (door scraping) (birds chirping) (horse whickering) (birds chirping) (Bess cooing) (men laughing)  Happy girl now, doo, doo  (Bess cooing) (Captain laughing) What a gentle little soul she is. You ain' got a problem with Rebs, now do you, boy. Our young host was born after hostilities ended. I'm sure he's a proud American, aren't you, boy. Nothing wrong with that, man should be loyal to his own country. Not everybody is. My daddy was a sharp shooter. Was he now? Will's not a bad shot himself. Why don't you go show these gentlemen that shotgun your daddy got you. Easy now. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me see that. Oh my goodness. Those Rebs best be careful coming around here. Oh. (men laughing) Will, warm up the coffee. Hope you like strawberry jam. That's all we could grow this spring. Oh, I'm sure we like it just fine. Before we dig in, boys, we like to have a little prayer. Keep us humble. Lord, please look down on us and help us to be grateful for these gifts that we have been given and help us to be always mindful of the needs of others and not think only of ourselves. We pray in the name of your son, Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. All right. (gun clicks) Ma! (Bess cooing) Will, get behind the stove with your sister. Now! (Bess crying) There must be some misunderstanding, ma'am. How have we offended? I don't feed killers in my house. Killers. Good Lord. (laughs) Oh, oh, I see the confusion. Boy, she is talking about those trophies that we got off that Cheyenne trader near Fort Laramie. Ma'am, I realize that's an unseemly business, but those can be very valuable objects when you're trading in the back country. Now can't we just sit back down and talk about something more pleasant. We were having such a nice time. I think it's best you go now. What the hell are we waiting for? She's only got two rounds. As you wish. And leave your guns. The hell we will. Ma'am, I'm sure you understand how valuable these weapons are. You can trade your scalps for some new ones. You heard the woman. Uh-uh, these were my pa's. They took him off his dead body of Pea Ridge. Fine. Can I have my hat? Will, give him his hat. (horse neighing) Hiyah! (door creaking) (cabinet thudding) Help me. (Bess crying) (both groaning) Push! Push! (Bess screaming) (glass crashing) (Hattie panting) (wind whooshing) (Hattie panting) (guns clicking) (glass crashing) (guns firing) Son of a bitch! (Bess screaming) (gun firing) (Hattie groaning) Ah, get down! (horse neighing) (gun firing) Wait a sec! Come and see! (gun firing) (glass crashing) Come and see! (groaning) Son of a bitch! (gun firing) (Bess screaming) (Hattie panting) (hooves thudding) (gun clicking) (Bess crying) (gun firing) (horse neighing) (Hattie panting) (Bess screaming) (wind whistling) (Bess crying) (horse neighing) (guns firing) (gun firing) (glass crashing) (horse neighing) Hyah! What the hell are you doing? I want 'em alive! Whoo! She can't shoot for jack shit. (men panting) (Bess crying) I need you to be brave. Okay? Okay. Reload. Take care of your sister. (Bess crying) (Long Hair panting) (bullets clicking) (door thudding) (Hattie panting) (door thudding) (gun firing) (Hattie panting) (horse neighing) (horse neighing) (Long Hair panting) (Hattie panting) (Hattie panting) (horse whickering) (Bess cooing) (gun firing) (Long Hair groaning) (Bess crying) (footsteps shuffling) (Long Hair groaning) (Hattie gasping) Just take what you want and go. (gun clicking) (hooves thudding) (laughs) But what we want is you. (crickets chirping) I can do anything. Lay track, shoot buffalo, run the teams. I appreciate the interest, Mr. McAllister. There simply isn't the work. We have more than enough men to meet our needs. There has to be something. I could even help with the chuck wagons. Oh Lord, we're not cowboys. We just bring our food up from down the line. Good day. Best of luck. (gentle music) (Bess crying) You're all right. It's okay. Here we go. Okay. Okay. Mrs. McAllister. (gun clicking) (Bess crying) Hide your sister. (gun clicking) Mrs. McAllister. That's far enough. I regret that we got off on the wrong foot. I would like for us to start over, make it right. There's nothing to talk about, except you men getting on your horses and riding off. I respect how you must be feeling and I can sympathize, but this standoff not doing anybody a lick of good. It's true that I've done my share of killing both during the war and after. But one thing I ain't never done, I ain't never hurt a woman or a child. Why should I believe a word you say. I had a daughter once. She was my only child, apple of my eye. Every bit of love and affection a father can give I lavished on that child. She's dead now. Buried out Cameron way. (wind whistling) I swear on her grave, I will not harm a hair on your head or on the heads of your children. (guns clicking) Dammit! (guns firing) Damn fools! (gun clicking) (Gold Tooth panting) (Bess crying) You okay? You okay? (gun firing) (gun clicking) (Hattie panting) (fire crackling) (Bess crying) I'm sorry, Mom. I didn't mean to wake her. That's all right. Bring her here. (Bess crying) (door scraping) (cow mooing) Come on, Bess. What are they doing with Daisy? (gun clicking) No. (gun firing) No! No. (men laughing) (Bess screaming) (knife scraping) (blood squirting) Sorry. (Long Hair groaning) Now, you hold him. Oh, hell, Captain, it'll heal itself. It'll heal on its own, Captain. It'll heal on its own. Jesus, Joseph and Mary, no. Please refrain from that papist blasphemy. Open his sleeve. Damn them all to hell! (sobbing) Well I reckon that all the sufferings of this present age are not worthy compared to the glory, which shall be revealed in us. It's gonna be all right. Pa couldn't have been Reb, Ma, just couldn't have been. That's what you're upset about? (sighs) Your Pa's no Rebel. He may have begun fighting for the South, but he ended that war a patriot. But you said that he was- Good and bad aren't always so clear, Will. Sometimes you wake up and you realize you're on the wrong side of things. And when you pa did, he have the courage to make things right. Just like he always does. And when he comes back, those killers outside are gonna feel God's wrath. What if they kill him instead? (Hattie sighs) (fire crackling) Better eat up, son. Hard to be brave on an empty belly. Well, Captain, there's, there's just something about all this that I don't rightly understand. Go on. Well, it's all you said about not hurting women or kids. And you think we ought to stand by that. You remember when your Pappy and I rode out to defend our way of life from the tyrant Lincoln. I do. We had a lot of fine ideas then about chivalry and honor and what war should look like. How the rightness of our cause would carry us to victory. And the Yankees stole our cattle. They burned our farms and hung our kin without cause. And all our fine notions were nothing in the face of their rapacious, murderous hatred. They took my only child from me, ripped her from this life without mercy or pity. And there ain't no law on earth or in heaven or hell that can keep a father from taking his revenge. Not the devil and not God himself. That make things any clearer? (fire crackling) Hell, we ain't gonna have to hurt anybody anyway. How you figure that? Mrs. McAllister ain't cut out for this kinda life. I can tell that by looking in her eyes. We give her enough time, she's just gonna come on out here to us. That's the sensible thing to do. And she is a sensible woman. Captain! What? The hell. Damnation! (Bess crying) (fire roaring) (ax thudding) (Bess crying) They'll see that for miles. (gun clicking) Ma! Keep it burning, you understand? Anything you can find. (Bess screaming) (Hattie panting) (gun firing) (door scraping) (fire roaring) (Bess screaming) (Hattie panting) (door scraping) (gun clicking) (gun firing) (glass crashing) (Hattie groaning) (door creaking) (Bess crying) (fire roaring) (gun firing) (men panting) (Bess crying) Look. (both coughing) (fire crackling) (Bess crying) (Hattie and Will coughing) (Bess screaming) Will, your sister. (coughing) (men panting) (guns clicking) (hooves thundering) (horse whickering) Come to a help. The children are still inside? You come alone, neighbor? Yeah, I see the smoke, I come riding real fast. Why? What's wrong. Mr. Sameson, no, go get help. Get help! No. I want him alive. Ride, Mr. Sameson, ride! (fire roaring) (hooves thudding) (Bess crying) (Hattie coughing) (fire crackling) Let it burn! Are you crazy? Captain wants them alive. (glass crashing) Just trying to help. (Bess screaming) (water splashing) (lasso whooshing) (hooves thudding) (Mr. Sameson groaning) (body thudding) (horse whickering) (birds squawking) (Mr. Sameson groaning) (wind whooshing) (birds chirping) (fire roaring) Let him go. Mrs. McAllister, I'm surprised. It does not dignify a woman to holler and carry on such. He hasn't done anything to you. Well, that is entirely true. But as you see, your obstinance has put us all in a difficult situation. So I'm gonna ask you again to come out here and let us resolve this like civilized people. Hattie, you stay there. He's a no good liar. He can't be trusted. Of course, you'd rather not be civilized. I'll have to resort to other methods. You don't have to do this. I'd hope not to. See, I'm a preacher's son. I was raised to believe in the Good Book. It's the only thing that keeps us from being savages. But even a preacher's boy has got his limits. Please. He has a wife and five children. The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. You made me to lay down. I don't like repeating myself. He led me besides the still waters. Mrs. McAllister, so I'm gonna say this one more time. Come on out! In the valley of the shadow off death, I will fear no evil. No. No. For thou art with me. (Hattie screaming) (blood spurting) (men cackling) (Bess screaming) (crickets chirping) (table crashing) (Bess crying) (fabric tearing) (fire roaring) (torch clattering) (fire roaring) (Hattie panting) (upbeat music) (horse whickering) (upbeat music) You left it across the street. See? Maybe I best come down and escort you across. No, miss, I'm quite all right. Hey. You really gonna drive home half liquored up? Seems to me you ought to sober up or just go on, get drunk all the way. I gotta get home to my farm. Farm? Your farm ain't gonna miss you. We got real nice beds in there. Soft satin sheets. Oh, you could sleep all night. Wake up first thing in the morning. Of course, you can do other things too. My wife. Your wife? She's waiting on me. (scoffs) Something tells me your wife, she don't appreciate you, hard workin' man like you, not the way you deserve. (body thuds) Oh, geez! (upbeat music) (people chattering) (horse neighing) Hyah! (Bess cooing) I think it's time you learned how to make some coffee. First, put on some water. (Bess cooing) (water trickling) Now we need to grind up some beans. You want 'em fine like table salt. Can we boil 'em? That may be how cow hands make some black sludge they call coffee, but it's not the proper way. Well, what do we do different? How's that grind looking? (coffee grinder whirring) Just like salt. Good. Now find something we can use as a filter. (Bess cooing) Now we wait for it to boil. You wanna know how your pa and I met? I was walking home from school one day back in St. Louis. It was during the war and the streets were full of soldiers. One bunch decided they wanted to have some fun. So they stole my books. (laughs) I begged and pleaded for them to give 'em back. But they wouldn't. And just when I started to cry, I heard someone order those boys to stop. I turned around expecting a lieutenant or a captain, but it was just your pa. He was all alone, in a private's uniform no less. There was one man against six, but there was something in his voice, something that said he could still lick every single one of them, one at a time or all together. When they heard it, one by one, they started to drift away till the last one, gave me back my books and apologized. Your pa asked me if he could walk me home. I said, yes, but in my heart, I already knew. Knew what? That he was the man I wanted to marry. That nothing in this world could ever cause him to give up and whatever would come, he would stand up and protect me. All right, now pour it over the beans, nice and slow. How about some more rock candy? Can't trick your coffee black, can you? (thunder rumbling) (crickets chirping) Will. Will! I need you to keep watch. I'll be right back. Psst, psst! Ma! Don't shoot. I just come the talk. You so much as flinch and I swear, I'll put a bullet through your heart. I ain't armed. Right through your heart. Please. The others don't know I come. Will you just listen? All right. Talk then. This ain't what I thought I was joining. We was supposed to rob banks and trains, not hurt women and children. It just don't sit right with me no more. You stood by why I killed my neighbor. If I'd done said anything, I'd be lying dead on the ground too. I remember my mama once warned me about falling in with bad company. Once I did, I didn't realize how hard it would be to part ways. Who are they? They're a gang from Missouri. They rode with Quantrill's Raiders during the war. Captain was his right hand man. Most of the fellers gave up when old Quantrill was killed or after the surrender. But not Captain. The war ain't never ended for him. Look, if if'n I help you, will you put in a good world with the US Marshall for me? Right then, here's my plan. The others are sleeping and I'm supposed to be on watch. If you and the young ones can get out of the window, I'll meet you back about a hundred paces. I'll bring horses. You can get 'em without waking them. I already done got 'em all saddled up. (crickets chirping) I'll get the children ready. We'll meet you in 10 minutes. All right. Thank you. And we can ride on out afore anyone's wiser and then go find Jeb. (gun firing) (glass crashing) (Bess crying) Jed! Son of a bitch! She got him, Captain. Now I gotta tell his mama! That dang fool kid couldn't lie for shit! You mind your tongue. Ma, he was just trying to help! I never told him your pa's name, not one time. Then how did they know it? They're not after us. They came looking for your pa. That's why they're out there taking their time. That's why they're out there now waiting. We're just the bait. Your father's walking into a trap. Will, I'm gonna need you to do something. And you're gonna have to be brave to do it. I need you to get the filly. What? No, I can't. Yes, you can. You're your father's son. It's our turn to protect him. (crickets chirping) (door creaking) (crickets chirping) (wind howling) (door creaking) (wind whistling) (horse whickering) (crickets chirping) (fire crackling) (Long Hair groaning) (cork popping) (groans) That little Yankee bastard! (groans) (wind whistling) (crickets chirping)  They took that Yankee bastard   They shot him in the head   They put him on the fire   So if mama saw he's dead  Sh! (Bess cooing) It's okay. It's okay. (hooves thudding)  The Yankee's went to Baltimore   And they came upon a mare  (hooves thudding) (crickets chirping) (door creaking) (footsteps shuffling) (Long Hair laughing) (hooves thudding) (crickets chirping) (door creaking) Hell, Captain, the horses are running to kingdom come! You get her! (wind whistling) Oh, come on. Son of a bitch! Get back here. (groans) (Bess cooing) Will! Will! Think you're going. You know, Captain, he didn't mean you no harm before, but he does now. (horse neighing) (blow thudding) (Bess screaming) Easy. (both groaning) (gun firing) No! No! No! No! (Bess screaming) You don't move. You understand me? Don't you move! Oh my god, my god, she got my face! Will, run! She got my face! God, she got my damn face! Will, run! Run! (Gold Tooth screaming) (birds chirping) (water whooshing) (hooves thudding) (water whooshing) (water roaring) (water splashing) (Bess crying) Go, run! Ma! Go! Take her! You run, just take her. Go to the Danielsons. Go! (groans) Go! Go! (Bess crying) (indistinct) (Hattie groaning) Come here, you! (water whooshing) (Bess crying) Come here, I got you! (Hattie groaning) Get out of there! Let go! (both groaning) Where'd you go? Come on out, I won't hurt ya. (both groaning) Bitch! (water roaring) (birds squawking) (fire crackling) That was a damn fool thing you done back there. Almost got yourself killed. I told you, I ain't never harmed a woman. Captain, when we gonna go get that little Yankee bastard? Shut your mouth. We got everything we need right here. All we gotta do is get Mrs. McAllister back home before she catches her death out here. Yeah, but you told me I could get him and bring him back here and cut his- Shut your belly achin' rotten mouth! (birds squawking) You move, you die. (birds squawking) (Gold Tooth groaning) You want to see how it feels to get your flesh burned off? Gentle does it, boys. As it says in Ecclesiastes: Cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shalt find it after many days. (hooves thudding) (Gold Tooth groaning) Jeb! Care to die? This ain't no way to start a conversation. Let her go, Miller. It's Captain Miller to you. I'd appreciate it if you'd remember that. Where are my children? They're safe. They made it across the river. You still call yourself a Confederate officer. You got no right to hold a woman prisoner. "For a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave unto his wife. And they shall be as one flesh." Genesis chapter two, 24th verse. Your sins have found you out, Jebediah McAllister, and now they are visited upon your whole family. (birds squawking) What do you want? Vengeance. Vengeance belongs to the Lord, Miller. Well, the Lord takes too damn long. Now I can see that I am being less than clear. So let me be blunt. You either put that gun down or your pretty little wife is gonna have her eyes cut out of her head. You said you never hurt a woman. I haven't, but he has. My daughter has laid in her grave for 12 years, while her murderers have walked free. We didn't murder anyone. It was an accident. She trusted you. She trusted you because you were her countryman. Not one man there knew she was inside. Ask him! (laughs) Not one man there draws breath, except you. We thought it was you in there. No, only my heart. Make it slow. Jeb! (whimpering) You swear, you won't hurt her. You'll let her go. No, no, Jeb! On my child's grave. You can't trust him. No. No, no, no, no! (Hattie groaning) (blows thudding) (men groaning) No, no! Ain't having no more little bastards now! (men laughing) (Hattie groaning) Hope you don't mind, Jebediah. The pleasure's all mine. You son of a bitch! (Gold Tooth laughing) (Hattie screaming) Come on, princess! His daughter? Why did you never tell me. Bad enough if I had to kill men for the Confederacy, I murdered a child for the union. It wasn't murder. You didn't know. It doesn't matter to him. When he finishes what he is gonna do, you ride outta here and don't look back. I'm not leaving, now or ever. (horse whickering) (bird screeching) (birds chirping) (men laughing) (birds chirping) (hooves thudding) (horse whickering) (birds chirping) (horse neighing) (Jeb and Hattie groaning) Well. Mrs. McAllister, pride goeth before a fall. (men laughing) Now, I think that you deserve to have a front row seat for this trial because of your close relationship with the accused. Jebediah McAllister, you are here by charged with crimes against God and the Confederate States of America, including a murder of a child. How do you plead? I have done what I have done. You have heard the confession. Don't hit my wife! Gentlemen of the jury- (Jeb groaning) Wahoo! How do you find the defendant? (laughs) Guilty as hell, Captain. Guilty as hell. (men laughing) You got no right. (blow thudding) (Jeb growling) Look what you have wrought, McAllister. Do you have anything to say for yourself? You don't give a damn what I have to say. Go on, do what you gotta do. No! Are you familiar with the book of Romans? (Hattie screaming) "For all, have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God."
