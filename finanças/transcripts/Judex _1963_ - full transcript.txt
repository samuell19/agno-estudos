UNANIMOUS WINNER JEAN—GEORGE AURIOL PRIZE, 1963 “Judex.” It’s a Latin word meaning “judge” or “avenger.” I know. Thank you. This "avenger" seems more like a blackmailer. I never thought anyone would dare blackmail me again. I don’t understand what this Judex wants. He asks for nothing for himself, whereas usually — Don’t be so naive, Vallieres. If I show the slightest fear, that’s when the real blackmail will start. We’ll soon find out. On to serious business. Did the bank phone with closing prices in New York? Yes, sir. It was as you predicted. Come in. Sir, a Mr. Cocantin is here to see you. He says you’re expecting him. That’s right. Show him in. Good timing. Mr. Cocantin. Allow me to introduce myself, sir. Alfred Cocantin, private detective. I run an agency called Celeritas, which I took over from my uncle, the late Mr. Regaudet, decorated for services to education — him, not me — Sit down. Thank you, sir. — And you, sir? — Mr. Vallieres, my secretary. I had occasion in the past to call upon the services of your predecessor, and l was very satisfied. I hope you’ll prove equally satisfactory. — Rest assured, sir. Here’s the situation: Tomorrow we celebrate both Favraux Bank’s 20th anniversary and my daughter Jacqueline’s engagement to Viscount Amaury de la Rochefontaine. The chateau will be full of guests, and I’m counting on you to prevent any indiscretions on the part of staff employed for the occasion or even by certain business acquaintances l was obliged to invite. You will be introduced as one of our guests. Mr. Vallieres will explain all the details, and you may inform him of your terms. l’ll introduce you to my daughter at once so that you’ll have free run of the premises. And while you’re at it, try to discover who wrote this letter. It’s no doubt some servant’s idea of a joke. Vallieres, come here for a moment. “Mr. Favraux, | order you to atone for your crimes by turning half of your fortune over to your victims. You have until 6:00 pm. tomorrow to comply.” Signed “Judex.” Phone Marco and tell him to sell all our Rio Pinto holdings, and to make sure people know it’s Favraux Bank that’s selling. In three days, we’ll buy it all back for next to nothing. I believe I’ll be treating myself to a nice birthday present. Come, my dear Cocantin. Let’s take in the spring air. / insist on speaking to Mr. Favraux! l have no time for charity. I’m not asking for charity. Don’t recognize me, do you? Twenty years in prison change a man. My name is Pierre Kerjean. — Never heard of you. You weren’t so haughty during your trial. You promised to make me a rich man if I kept quiet and took the fall for you. You promised to watch over my family while I served my time. But my wife died destitute, and my son disappeared, and you didn’t lift a finger. Now, Favraux, you’re going to help me find my son. If you don’t, it’s not too late for me to talk. This man’s crazy. Give him 40 sous and send him away. Come along, my good man. My dear Jacqueline, this is Mr. Cocantin. He will be our guest tomorrow. Allow me to introduce my daughter, Mrs. Aubry. Mr. Favraux informed me of your engagement. I’m honored to be among the first to congratulate you. Thank you, sir. Ah, here’s my granddaughter, Alice. Say hello to the gentleman, darling. — Hello. Hello, young lady. I know of a little girl named Alice. — Like me? — Yes. She was in her garden one day, and what did she see run past? A rabbit dressed in a lovely blue suit. He stopped in front of Alice without seeing her and took out his watch and said — — The rabbit had a watch? Yes, a gold watch on a chain. Like Grandfather? Excuse me, ma’am. I’ve come to get Miss Alice for her lesson. Mr. Cocantin, this is Miss Verdier, my granddaughter’s governess. Go with Miss Marie now, and be a good girl. Good—bye, my darling. Show that gentleman over there to his room. Yes, sir. I don’t understand. I went to make inquiries early this morning, as you asked. That vagabond never regained consciousness and died last night at the hospital he’d been taken to by passers—by who’d found him. And no one suspects you. “Not content to merely destroy other people’s lives, you murder them as well. If by midnight tonight you have not carried out my orders, you will be punished mercilessly. Judex.” Did you murder someone? — What? I mean... this letter — Let me remind you you’re not here on vacation nor to tell stories about rabbits and watches. But!— Silence! You have until this evening to find out who wrote those letters. Good—bye, monsieur. — Very well. ...Miss Jacqueline doesn’t seem too happy about it. .. No, and as the big day approaches. . . Her father’s making her remarry, though she was quite unhappy the first time around. He married her off too young, poor girl. He must like the sound of a “de la Rochefontaine” for a son—in—law! And what a match for the bridegroom! It seems he doesn’t have a sous. I’m sure he can’t wait to come sleep in this bed. No, Mr. Favraux. .. I will never be your mistress. Marie, I need you so. Will you be my wife? We’ll be married right after Jacqueline’s wedding. My fortune will be yours. I’m not the sort of woman you can buy. “‘Will you walk a little faster?’ said a whiting to a snail. ‘There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail. See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle. Will you come and join the dance?”’ I wonder what sort of mask Favraux will wear. A vulture’s head. My dear friends... I’d like to announce some great and happy news. Tonight we are not only celebrating the culmination of 20 years of effort and utmost dedication that have allowed the Favraux Bank to prosper and extend its activities into almost every branch of industry. We’re celebrating as well... the engagement of my daughter Jacqueline to Viscount Amaury de la Rochefontaine. My joy is all the greater — With the great happiness I feel at this moment — I’m a doctor. Let me through. He’s dead. Diana... THE NIGHT AFTER FAVRAUX’S FUNERAL... Mr. Favraux died at the exact time indicated in Judex’s second letter. The coincidence is extremely troubling. I felt it was merely that — coincidence. That’s why I said nothing. I felt it was my duty to inform you. Mrs. Aubry will decide for herself what action to take. Mr. Cocantin... I’m sure I needn’t ask you to exercise the utmost discretion. Besides, I believe you’re bound by professional secrecy. You can count on me, sir. Vallieres, we must alert the police. No, madame. That’s impossible. Why? Madame, those letters speak the truth. Show me some kind of proof. | only remained in your father’s employ to try to set right, insofar as my modest means would allow, certain misdeeds I’d been powerless to prevent. Mr. Favraux’s fortune... like that of many others... has its origins... in the Panama scandal. Your father was at that time just a stockbroker’s clerk. And then... fate placed in his possession — I’d rather not say how — certain documents that were very compromising for certain high—ranking politicians and financiers. With those documents, he had no trouble obtaining the funds and backing to carry out his first major business deals. As early as 1882, when the Union Générale Bank crashed... Not a moment too soon. This will take three days. Follow the doctor’s instructions to the letter, and don’t let your guard down for a single moment. Jacqueline, the gentleman is right. It’s no use insisting. I’ve given it a lot of thought. l’m renouncing my inheritance. | only ask that my daughter’s share be kept for her until she comes of age. I’ll leave it in your hands, and I thank you. My respects, madame. This is madness! Why are you doing this? Since my inheritance seems to be of such great concern to you, it’s only fair to release you from your vow. Do as your feelings dictate. In that case, allow me to reclaim my freedom. Your luggage has been loaded on the carriage outside, sir. You are free to leave whenever you wish. Thank you, Fernand. Good—bye. Good—bye, sir. Madame, I’ve come to say good—bye. Good—bye, Vallieres. Thank you for everything. I remain your devoted servant. Don’t hesitate to call if you need me. Thank you, Vallieres. You’re my only friend. I’m going to be very lonely. My little Alice only left yesterday, and I miss her already. I worry about her. There’s no reason to. Marie—Jeanne is a fine woman, and she adores the child. Besides, Loisy isn’t that far away. I know. I suppose all mothers are like me. Good—bye. Come see me now and then. I’d like that. I’ll write you with my new address. Good—bye, madame. Well, well — Favraux’s widow! Please! That’s not funny. If you only knew how it felt to leave there with my wages in hand like a servant, when l was nearly the lady of the house. Don’t be angry. I was just joking. You think I’m happy about the situation? He could at least have married you and then kicked the bucket. Hands off. This isn’t the time. Save your energy for tonight. — What are we doing tonight? — Going back to the chateau. — What? Listen. There are some extremely valuable documents in his office. We’ve hit the mother lode this time. Have a look in there. Hello .7 Act natural or you’ll regret it. Jacqueline, he/p/ Help me! Jacqueline, answer me! Marie Verdier! Get the chloroform! Let’s take her with us. It’ll give us time to make her talk. My tool bag. “If anyone threatens you, set these pigeons free. I will rush to your aid. I’m watching over you. Judex.” That was Favraux’s voice on the phone. I’m sure of it. It could have been a hoax. What about the dogs? And Judex’s threatening letters to Favraux? Are they hoaxes too? What if Favraux’s still alive, held prisoner by Judex? It could be worth trying to find him, right? You’d stand to gain too if! married him. Keep dreaming. If Favraux marries you — assuming we find him — when Jacqueline tells him what you did to her last night — She won’t be a nuisance much longer, once I learn what’s happened to her father — which won’t be long now. What do you intend to do? I need two strong men. Go tell Pierrot and Leon. The four of us will pay our respects tonight at Favraux’s grave. MEANWHILE, AT FAVRAUX’S “GRAVE”... Favraux! BANKER FAVRAUX. .. I HAD CONDEMNED YOU TO DEATH. YOUR DAUGHTER’S ACTIONS HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE. I CONDEMN YOU INSTEAD TO LIFE IMPRISONMENT. Where is he? I want to talk to him. Later. You’re still too weak. You had a close call. No thanks to him. If you hadn’t picked me up in time — Perhaps he knows something about my son. I thought about that myself when l snatched him from his grave. Just as I thought. Favraux has vanished. We have to find Jacqueline. — But how? She left her kid with the nanny. I’ll get her address from the nanny. Your turn. Come in. A telegram for you, Mrs. Aubry. Thank you. Mrs. Vivier. My daughter’s just had a serious accident. This is from her nanny. I must go. It may not be as bad as you fear. I’ll look after the little one. There she is. She fell for the telegram. Your turn now, Pierrot. Have you got it? Room 20, third floor. Grab any papers bearing Favraux’s name or dealing with banks or money. We’ll pick up Morales and head for the countryside. Got it. If I run into anyone, I’ll say I’m checking the plumbing. A pigeon just arrived. Kerjean will drive you to Loisy. See if anything’s happened to a Marie—Jeanne Bontemps there who’s looking after a little girl named Alice. Get the other car ready for me. I’ll stop in Paris first. Are you feeling ill, madame? Lean on me. This woman doesn’t look well, Sister. May I offer you my car? Thank you, sir. We’ll take her to the clinic where | work. That poor woman looks terribly ill. These city women are so fragile. How true. — She’s not sinking. — We should have weighed her down. I want to see where she goes. Ship ahoy! There’s someone in the water. Hey, mister! There’s someone in the water! Quick, go get help! Let’s hope she’s dead. Follow them and try to find out. — Is she dead? — No, she fainted. No, go play elsewhere. You shouldn’t see this. Call Marville for an ambulance right away. I’m on my way. Get up! Help! Help! It’s the same lady. — What’s going on? — Damn piece of junk! — What’s the problem? — I don’t know. It broke down. Did an ambulance go by coming from Loisy? Not half an hour ago. It went that way. Thank you. Watch the vehicles. I’ll have a look around. You think anyone’s inside? It’s abandoned. Better here than out on the road, right? Go get the car and come back for us. It’s quite a hike! Stop! Kill him! He saw me. My name’s Pierre Kerjean. That ring was once mine. I gave it to my wife the day l was arrested. You’re my father. Filthy traitor! Now I’ve told you everything. If Mother hadn't died — If you’d been with us, perhaps things would have been different. It’s a good thing you appeared. — Rather late in the game. No, Judex. This is my son. l’ve forgiven him — Where are the others? — The woman’s in there. Break down the door. Two men brought you to me. They said they knew of my loyalty to your family. You were delirious. They left without further explanation. The younger of the two said his name was Judex. Who are you? Don’t come any closer. Don’t be afraid. l’m Vallieres. What about my daughter? Why isn’t she here? She’s safer in Loisy, where my men are watching over her. Your men? Listen to me, I beg you. I’m not your enemy. You know that. Leave me alone. You killed my father. No, Jacqueline. He’s alive. Alive? It’s true. I intended to kill him. I could have done so without arousing the slightest suspicion. But I couldn’t do it... for your sake. BUT WHAT HAD BECOME OF COCANTIN THE DETECTIVE? “The coffin was empty. With a cry of rage, the two nuns recoiled as the coffin fell to the ground. ‘Just who are you?’ cried one, as she suddenly threatened the other with a gun. The other nun pulled out a gun too. ‘Enough of this charade!’ she shouted imperiously. With their free hands, both nuns pulled off their veils, and cries of hatred escaped their lips. ‘Juve!’ ‘Fantomas!”’ What is it now? Sir, this little kid — What nerve! Mr. Cocantin, please. That’s me, my child. What do you have to tell me? This woman here is the nun who kidnapped Alice’s mother in an ambulance. When the real nurses got back to the village, they were a mess. Alice said it was her governess, and Marie—Jeanne knew you were a — What are you again? A detective. Right. She said you were a detective... and that you were at Alice’s mother’s chateau when she was rich. Hold on. I’m not following any of this. This is Mrs. Aubry, and this is Miss Verdier. Leave us, please. — Yeah, go away. Try to be a bit clearer. What’s Miss Verdier got to do with kidnapping someone? That’s Alice’s governess. It was on Marie—Jeanne’s mantelpiece. She’s the nun in the ambulance who took Alice’s mother away after she drowned. What’s all this about nuns? You’re sure this is the place? | tell you, Marie—Jeanne said it was here. l was so happy with you. Why did this have to spoil everything? You know I still love you. For me nothing’s changed. No, it’s over. I could never trust you again. We can start over. We can forget about all this. Leave me alone. Can’t you see I’m unhappy and that we’re through? Leave me and go. Go find your darling daddy, since he means so much to you. My father told me where Favraux is, and I know how to get to him. It’s her! See you tomorrow along the Cote des Moines. I’ll be tailing you tomorrow, sweetheart. — Me too! — No, you’ll stay at my place. This could be dangerous. Come on. Careful. I’m being followed. — I don’t understand! — Well! It’s Mr. Cocantin. Since he’s so curious, we’ll take him with us. Keep an eye on him. I’ll hide the car. Get out. THAT EVENING, THANKS TO JUDEX... JACQUELINE WOULD SEE HER FATHER AGAIN. Don’t say a word. We’ve no time to waste. Go straight to Loisy and gather the men. Await my orders there. Come with me, Cocantin. Your father’s been kidnapped. I promised l’d return him to you, and I’ll keep my word. — And that’s all you heard? — Just the name of the town, and a building being torn down. Not much to go on. It’s got to be around here. How’d he get here? — It’s unbelievable! — How’d you get here? In the crooks’ car. I know where they are. — Get in. — I hid in the trunk. It’s that way. They’re up there. They barred the door. Call Loisy 3 and give them our location. Loisy 3... We’re safe here. Here’s what we’ll do. We’ll go into hiding for a while. When Judex has lost all trace of you, you can reemerge. You’ll recover your name and your fortune. My brother and I will help you. You’ll be rich and powerful once again. No, dear Marie, that’s impossible. Many people were only too glad l’d “died,” some of them in high places. I’m ashamed to admit it, but people hated me. If I came back, I wouldn’t remain alive for long. There’s too much at stake. All | ask is to be forgotten and to be left alone to live with my daughter and granddaughter. Mr. Favraux... you asked me once to marry you. | only hesitated because of your vast fortune. Now... I can say yes. I’m sure he didn’t come alone. The others might already be inside or on the roof. Go and see. Mr. Favraux... we could be in for a rough night. Get some rest. There’s a bed next door. What about you? Don’t worry about me. I’ll keep watch here with my brother. When I get tired, you can come take my place. Morales is a coward. He’ll betray me the first chance he gets. I want nothing more to do with him. I need a man like you. Favraux has certain information that’s worth a fortune. I know how to get him to talk. Just think of what we could do together... you and l. Your loss, you fool! It’s to keep him from yelling. Come next door. DAISY’S CIRCUS Daisy! Cocantin! Stop! I’m so happy to see you again. Come this way. You know my uncle, the lion tamer, that brute who “only wanted what was best” for me? Well, the lions ate him. Now I’m free. But what are you doing here? I’m waiting for a friend who’s in danger up there. You have to help him! I can’t. I’m no acrobat. Sound asleep. Lucky him. We should get out of here right now. His men could find us any minute. We can’t just let them nab us here! Perhaps you’re right. Bring the car around to the door by the empty lot. Stop! Hands up and don’t move. One move and you’re dead. You’ll never get me again, Judex. For the last time, Favraux, give yourself up, or I’ll break this door down. IN HOMAGE TO LOUIS FEUILLADE IN MEMORY OF AN UNHAPPY TIME
