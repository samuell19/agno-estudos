DEAR UNKNOWN (I Sent a Letter to my Love) How beautiful! Fantastic. Come on. Afternoon tea's ready. That's from Pontivy, I can smell it from here. Louise, Louise, you spoil me, you're too nice. I just wanted something from Pontivy, that's all. I thought we were having jam sandwiches. - Did I say you couldn't have any? - No, not at all. Then stop acting like a kid. - And try not to make a mess. - You never put any colouring in it. They're going to make us die with their chemicals. - Watch the crumbs. - Watch the crumbs. You know what would make me happy? Are you listening? You know what would make me happy? - What would make you happy? - If we went for a walk. - Now? - Now. Up the cliff. The cliff... the cliff is three kilometers away. It's not you who has to do all the pushing. It's been years since I've gone there. - It can wait a little longer. - No! I feel like going now. Look at that... why don't you listen? I'm not going to put a bib on you at your age. Why don't you pay attention? I'll spend my life cleaning up after you. Do you think I do it on purpose? I wouldn't mind. You'd prefer that I did it on purpose? Well if you did, then at least I could understand why you get on my nerves. I get on your nerves? Yes, you do. Haven't you noticed? I don't mean to. I don't have any choice. If I could go out by myself, I wouldn't need you to look after me. Just a bit more, Loulou. No, I'm getting dizzy up here. - Go on. For me! - Not another millimetre. I'm not going to keel over just to make you happy. Quit it! Or I'll leave you up here. Do you remember, we had a picnic at the creek there. - I don't remember. - Yes, with Mama, Papa and Uncle Michel! If it makes you feel better, I'll remember. I still had my legs and blond hair. You were jealous of my hair... It was an accident, inspector. We were looking at the sea, he was singing Plaisir d'Amour. He kept saying "A bit more, closer... " But I was dizzy, you understand, The chair slipped away, it crashed. And my brother fell to pieces on the rocks, like a marionette. He was a heavy drinker, papa. Poor papa. Poor old him. Dearly departed. Come on, time to go home now. You know, soon, I'll see more of the sea. You believe me? What's this story about seeing more of the sea? - Princard said you were fine. - I like Princard. - True, I'm better. - So, you're OK then. But whenever I feel better I'm afraid of getting worse. I won't see the sea, and she won't see me. What's in the newspaper? A hold-up in Brest. Three gangsters with balaclavas. - Did they get much? - 300,000. What would you do with 300,000? - I'm speaking in New Francs. - 300,000, that would be... 30,000,000. Yes. Well, with 30 million I could take you on a cruise. You'd see the sea all the time time and the sea would see you. Where would we go? We'd go to America... ...the Caribbean. And Borneo. No, no, I'd rather go to Sweden. Well, with 30 million you could go around the world. Can you imagine, around the world? I'd lay on a deckchair, stretch out, ...the blood pulses in my legs... ...my knees are bending... ...my toes begin to move, I get up, ...I walk, walk, walk. Are there women on this boat? Of course there are women. Two Swedish nurses... ...to attend to your every need. As for me, I'll dance... ...with the captain. Cigarette butts. Socks. - The door! - I'm not deaf. It's Yvette! I know. My bread will get cold! It's freezing out there, you have no idea. Yes. It's winter. Smells like freshly baked bread. He shouts like an ogre. I've never seen anyone like your brother. I really admire you. A father broke his son's arm, 8 months. He couldn't sleep. Who broke his arm? His father! Oh, damn! Hi there, Yvette. Wait 'till I cut it! I asked you to keep an eye on the coffee. That's not too hard, is it? It's not your hands that are crippled. Louise! - Louise, what? - What a thing to say. I can't do it while I'm reading the paper. Well, I can't make breakfast, while I'm cleaning up that pigsty of a room. You're exaggerating, it's so clean here you could eat off the floor. Oh no, no, you never wipe your feet coming in. But if it's your heart's desire, then eat off the floor. I wasn't trying to cause trouble. It's no trouble. If someone's angry, it means they're troubled. Well said. Good observation. Bravo, well done. You're making fun of me. Both of you. Not very fair. Guess not. Oh, do you know who I met yesterday? Louise Louise Jacquot... pretty redhead with green eyes, who went to school with you. Don't remember. Yes, you do, you hated her! I don't know why, she was nice. You pulled her hair. She had the biggest tits. You idiot. That's right, she had huge tits! Like melons or pumpkins. We wanted to take a mouthful of 'em. You're shocking the girl. - True, let us respect the innocent. - That's got nothing to do with it. It's simple: the word for me is breasts, not tits. I'm not thick. We never said you were. We never even thought it. - Have you finished the newspaper? - Yes, yes. I'd rather read newspapers than watch TV... it dulls the brain. And you Louise, you should read more. I read, I read classifieds. Which ones? All of them, they amuse me. Here, widower... sixties... still going strong... likes music and old chapels... wishes to meet lady. Disgusting. Looks like a cattle market. What are we doing today? You'll go back to your room, you to your bakery, And I'll do my dishes. Can I tell you something, and you won't be angry? Say whatever you like. I think... I feel... You feel or do you think? I feel you're more and more unjust, with poor Gilles, with your brother. My brother and Gilles, the same thing. I know you've given over your life to looking after him, it's admirable. But he's a nice sort and never complains about anything. He's not demanding. He's always smiling. Me, I'd be happy, to take care of a brother like yours. Ah, I understand. That would put a man in your house. And it would not... ...put a man in your bed, with legs... ...that close about you, hands that caress you, which would beat you sometimes. And a mouth. Really! Yes, a mouth. It's a carousel. This is a carousel! A real carousel. - Have a turn. - What? Both of you have a turn, for me. I'll pay for it. Listen, in the end... It's silly. What will you be doing? I'll watch you. What do you say? Oh, let's go if it'll make him happy. Go on. Yvette! Gilles doesn't look too good. How do you feel? Awful. - Princard said it will go tomorrow. - I don't like Princard. Do you want me to make some vegetable soup? No. What about crepes with a little strawberry jam? Nothing. Stay there. Hold on, please. I wouldn't want you to go away, Gilles. That would leave me all alone. Solo female... No. Celibate... Woman without children. Aged... ...Fifty... No children. Appreciates... Appreciates the calm, ...the feelings... ...the lofty sentiments. Appreciates peace... Appreciates calm. Period. Tenderness. Beatrice. Beatrice Deschamps. Why not? - Good morning. - Hello. How are you feeling? Okay. I feel better. - Bravo. - Did you notice anything? - What? - The coffee. Very good. It's not such a feat. I don't know if I should keep it up. That's my bread. - My paper! - You can read it later. - Hello Louise. - Your feet. Is it the bread? Oh, that one again! I've never seen anyone so impatient. - Hi Gilles. - Hello Yvette. Don't be such a glutton! At least wait until I cut it. Look, crumbs everywhere. She's right, your sister, you know. I was told, it seems that, a woman in Quimper had a baby with two heads. And in Douarnenez, a woman had a baby with a body of lobster. - Enough, I'm eating. - Probably because of the Pill. Two abnormal children in the same week just in this region. So how many are there in France in a year? Newspapers don't talk about it, the government forbids it. It's like drugs. Are you still going on about that? It's true! Kids who are 9 or 10 are smoking dope. - Smoking what? - Hashish. Pass me the jam. It's one of the great failings of our society. The Golden Triangle, drug-trafficking... - The Golden Triangle, huh? - Lobster-babies! - It's horrible. - Don't think about it. I'm going to get my hair done. Maybe have a perm. And get some new pants. What are you going to do with pants? What will I do? The same thing I do with dresses. I'll wear them. - You never wear pants. - Exactly. I've got the right to. Aren't I old enough? You'll look ridiculous, Louise, really. Ridiculous yourself, Yvette. Wonderful! As if I'd seek advice from a tomboy... who only sees her father's bakery. A tomboy. Me, a tomboy? Yvette the tomboy. - Hello, madam. - Madam. I'd like to see some pants. Sure. Monique! Hello, Madame, can I help you? I'd like to see some pants like the ones on display. - They're for you? - No, for my sister. What size is your sister? We're about the same. She lives in Brest. The other day she came by and saw these pants. A lot of those I only have in small sizes. - Show madam the Saint-Pol set. - In black? Yes. It's hard to believe, that we didn't find pants at Brest, but my sister is stubborn, stubborn! How's this? If your sister has a heavy build, it's best to wear black. You think? It's the best way to go. Black slims the silhouette. Here, try them on. Hello, Louise! You didn't wake up this morning? Apparently not. Is this all the mail? Yes, that's all. What a funny look on your face, if only you could see it. Woke up on the wrong side of the bed. What would we do without coffee? You notice that the gulls are quieter? The birds aren't singing as much. The oil on the sea stops evaporation, the oxygen decreases, then birds that are above, ...can't breathe that well. They get out of breath flapping wings. You never get out of breath. It's true, I read it in the paper. Or on television, I think. You read everything, you've seen everything and you know nothing about anything. It's true, there's a film, Oil on the sea. That's right, there's oil, three-headed kids, lobster-babies... Oh no! Look at that! Yvette has a much more open mind than yours. That's all she has to open. Oh, Louise! Tell me, at school, you were the youngest of us all. But it was you that explained how babies were born? You couldn't beat her for sex education. And you, unbeatable on practical work. What do you mean? Your knowledge was higher than ours. Did she ever tell about her experiences? We don't talk about things that aren't nice. No, go ahead, speak. Shut up, okay. You say shut up because you won't say anything. You don't think there's anything to say? Nothing. And after landing that story that drove mama mad. She was already half mad, our mother. What was done with a black American guy, that you were carried about by him everywhere. Little bastard. I know that story about the black guy. But there must be others. It's Thursday. I could take Gilles for a walk. That way, you could take the day off, Louise. You're not cold? No, no. - It's time. - Just another minute. What else is there left to look at? Well, look. So, yes, it's the sea I travel without moving. I'm a sort of Cyrano de Bergerac. Open your mouth, Cyrano. For Yvette. For Princard. The mail's here. Look what you did. It's sticky, this stuff. It's okay, Loulou. It's not you that does the laundry. Go see. "Dear Unknown. I found, by chance, your ad," "published in the Telegram last week. " "I felt the need to respond. " "It's not easy to write this kind of letter. If I decide today," "it's in the hope that you read it with indulgence and sympathy. " "I must confess that I'm infirm. I suffer from rickets. " "I'm not able to walk, and I'm in a wheelchair. " "Only my legs are affected. " "The rest of my body is intact. I feel full of strength and energy," "But I have little opportunity to use it," "Because I have few friends. I'm unable to take care of myself," "is what they say. But I'm not convinced. " "Who knows, one day, I'll have to prove it. " "I live with my sister Louise. She takes care of me with devotion. " "She hates her name. She's wrong, it's a beautiful name. " "It's more beautiful the more I think about it. " "I'm tormented by the thought that," "she didn't marry because of me. Now it's too late. " "If I was to experience a great friendship with a woman," "She would look like Louise. I live in Sainte-Anne-la-Palud," "in our parents' house. I'm familiar with the beach," "I look at it from my window. As a child I ran on the beach. " "I want to talk about my my childhood, if you'd like. " "It's a little ridiculous to write to you," "but I'm sure you're very beautiful. " "I hope you'll answer me, but not out of pity. " If my legs are paralysed, know that my heart is free. I know how to love. " "Sincerely yours, Gilles Martin. P.S. If you write me," "send me a picture. " What are you looking at? Nothing, I'm just looking. "Dear Gilles. Your letter made me upset. " "Your sincerity touches me greatly. "It doesn't matter that you're disabled," "My heart is as free as yours. " "And I do know that you love. My name is Beatrice Deschamps. " "I live with my mother, who is sick. " "She needs me constantly. I understand your sister Louise. " "I have things in common with her. " "Have no regrets. She must feel happiness," "to care for a loved one. " "We live in a pavilion near the old port. " "My room is small," "With a brass bed. I would have a picture of you," "to put near my bed, so I can see you well. " "I'll try to send one. " "Am I beautiful? I don't know. " "But I'm full of love and ready to show it. " "I know St. Anne la Palud, from when I was little. " "I remember the rocks," "the sand dunes and caves where I hid. " "I want to see it but it's hard to leave my mother alone. " "Dear Gilles, write to me poste restante. " "My mother's curious and I don't want her to know we're writing. " "I'm waiting for your next letter. Cheers, Beatrice. " You got mail this morning. It's about a new stamp catalogue. A newsletter. I think I'll start collecting again. You'll subscribe? Yes, I think so. It's published by a woman. Beatrice Deschamps. What's wrong? Nothing. It'll come once a week. I'm happy to see you're interested in something. Me too, I like it. 3 francs 50, please. There's a lot of people. Yes, I see. For post restante it's better to come in the afternoon. There's no queue. - You come here often? - Every week. Hello, Madame Thomas. How are you? - Any mail for me? - Wait a moment, I'll see. She's come every day for 40 years. I'm sorry, Mrs. Thomas. There's nothing today. Excuse me. We all know her. She's waiting for a letter from her fiance. He died in the war. She comes for the post restante. - And you? - What about me? I'm not trying to be nosey. You expecting a letter? It's not for me. It's for a friend who has no fixed address. Next. - Do you have a letter for me? - Your name? Beatrice Deschamps. - Mrs or Miss? - Miss. I'll see. Deschamps. Miss Beatrice Deschamps. There. You have ID? I forgot. You'll have to come back. I can't give it to you without verifying your identity. Next. See you. See you. - Hello, Madame Guillaume. - You have a little mail for me? "Dear Beatrice. I like that name. " "It reminds me of the sound of the harp. " "I had a teacher who played the harp. Her name was Beatrice Renard. " "When I hear the harp, I think of the name Beatrice. " "You see, we are not only united by the beach," "But also by my childhood memories. " "I try to imagine your face. Send me a photo. " "I've had trouble finding one of me. Shall I tell you how I see you?" "If I told you what I think? Of your chest, warm and soft. " "I'd put my head against your breast. Do you blush when you read that?" "Oh, Beatrice, I love you already. We're made for each other. " "I want so much for you to come and see me soon. " "P.S." "It doesn't bother you for me to write this way?" Photos were more beautiful. They knew how to seize the soul, as much as the face. That you, Louise? Of course it's me. - Has the mail come? - No. Why? Are we expecting a letter? A love letter? Why would I want that? I don't want love letters. I know people who would love me no matter how feeble I am. - You're not that bad off. - If I am, then I'm lame. Yes! I'm disabled, I'm distorted, I'm mutilated. Stop it! Don't mince words... I'm crippled. Go ahead, say it. Crippled. Cri... ipp... led. Say it. Say it, for god's sake. Gilles Martin, you're a cripple. There. Thanks. You've always been one. You always will be. Thank you, thank you. And me, I'm not an old woman. I'm an old maid. Say it. You're not an old woman, you're an old maid. Thank you. - You've always been one. - I always will be. - Always. - Always. - Always. Always. - Always. Always. Enough now. Enough. "Dear Gilles. I'm sending a picture of me. " "I took it from the family album I found in the attic. " "I'm sad that I can't come to see you. " "At least not until my mother is better. " "Dear Gilles, your impatience to meet me, your desire, is precious to my heart. " "I feel you're so determined, so strong. " "It doesn't bother me that you write the way you do. On the contrary. " "Your letter has awakened in me desires that were long forgotten. " "I blushed reading it. " "If I blushed, it was because I could feel your head resting against my chest. " "I blushed even more thinking already that I love you too. "Write me soon. Yours, Beatrice. " Looks like you fell out of bed this morning. You weren't even expecting me. Let me cut it properly. That's just sleazy, what you did. What's going on? - I grabbed her ass. - He pinched me. - You can pinch me back. - I don't think it's funny... not at all. He does it, and admits it. He was just making a joke. He's never done that before. I'm wrong, because I like it. Come on Yvette, take it easy. I'm sorry, excuse me. Don't make a drama out of it Yvette. Listen... he did it without thinking. You're my best friends, both you and... I was just being friendly, believe me. You never did that before. For years you've been my only friends. I bring you bread, and I see this bad behaviour, - and bad thoughts. - You're getting carried away. He just pinched your ass, that's all! Give me your bowl and drink your coffee before it goes cold. There. And some good apricot jam. It's okay, Yvette. How about we go on a picnic, girls? - Picnic? - Nobody's on the beach. That's for sure. Why not? I can cook a chicken. And you can ask Jeannette to fill in at the bakery. Okay, I can be back in an hour with an apple pie. Or plum... What do you prefer? Both! I'll take the bottle of port. - The bottle of port? - Yes, the port. It's turning into an orgy. Be right back. Louise! Yes, I'm coming! What the...? You could say you're keeping secrets. And you too! Both in pants, that's a coincidence. It suits you very well. You too. I wonder why we hadn't thought of it earlier. Look, see. I had to try it. Come on, the sun's not going to wait. What are they doing? You first. What on earth... It's convenient. It's convenient? They're great. You're completely transformed. It fits you really well! Hey, they'd suit Yvette, too... What, you too? Am I dreaming or what? Both of them! I'm going out with the two best looking girls in the country! This is the happiest day of my life! Come help me, Yvette. Yes, Yvette, help us. Go, girls, go! That's good! I can see your ass. Nice shade of pink. What am I going to do? It's fine. I know. She doesn't move any more today. I'll find a spot. This is as good as anywhere. Don't fall over, now. Two asses would be too much for me! Come here. It's not funny. Yvette! Come help me. What a tart! I can't! - Forget about your butt, come on! - But I can't! Oh, I put it around? Good idea. Why'd you take his jacket? You couldn't take the blanket? He gave it to me. What's the matter with you? And you, what are you playing around for? - You're just jealous. - Jealous! You think I haven't seen you fooling about with my brother? - You've got the wrong idea. - Don't play innocent. We should come here more often. I feel good here with you two. Very good. This isn't a good idea, I might get it dirty. Anyway, you've seen everything now, I've got nothing to hide. Well, then use this. It's yours, too. Cheers. "Dear Beatrice. " "I went for a walk with Yvette, the friend I told you about. " "We walk on Thursdays so my sister can rest. " "The wheels of my chair leave tracks. " "I thought then that I don't leave footprints in the sand any more. " "I also thought that the sea would wash away the tracks. " "So I felt better. " "Beatrice, come see me after receiving this letter. " "If I don't see you, I'll think you're just a dream," "I need you. Your hands on my forehead. " "I want you to touch my eyes, my mouth, my face. " "Come to me, Beatrice. I love you. " "Gilles. " "Dear Gilles. Your letter made me tearful. " "No, I'm not a dream. I'm here. My body is calling you. " "You must not despair of me. I'm yours forever. " "I want to be against you, feel your warmth, your hands on me. " "Unfortunately I'm not able to come. " "Forgive me, my love, but my mother is becoming worse. " "The doctor thinks that the worst may occur. I can't leave her. " "I'm risking enough going out to post this to you," "But your letters are indispensable to me, like the air that I breathe. " "Write me. Don't abandon me. " "When I went to get your letter, Madame Thomas was in front of me. " "I told you about her," "She's been waiting for a letter from her fiance for 40 years. " "This time there was a letter for her. " "She could barely open it. " "Inside the envelope was a blank piece of paper. " "Some idiot had played a joke. " "Nobody laughed. " "I couldn't stand the thought you'd write no more," "and that I'd be like her, waiting every day. " "Dear Gilles, write soon. " "Your love, Beatrice. " You feel unwell? Yes. No. Not like that. Here's your tea. Thanks, that's good of you. Louise. Come here, Louise. Put your hands on my eyes. You've got soft hands. What's with the blank looks this morning? My brother Hugh came to see me. If you want, I'll take you out. We can spend the day with him. Well, go on. It'll clear your head. He's nice, Hugh. It's been a long time since you've seen him. - I want to go to town. - To town? To the old harbour. I haven't seen it for ages. Wouldn't you rather have a walk on the beach? I want to go to town! I'm old enough to know what I want! I'll take him in the car, then we can see Hugh. You can have the whole day to yourself. Listen, it's two hours we've been here. What are you looking for? - What did you say? - What are you looking for? I'm not looking for anything, I observe, I remember. That's it. You don't want to see Hugh now? No, not now. We've already seen the church, the post office, the town hall. Now the port. You're a bit weird today, you know. Yvette, please. "Dear Beatrice. " "I'm so sad you can't come. " "It means that your desire isn't as great as mine. " "The wait is unbearable. I can't keep this up. " "If you don't want to come, This letter will be the last. " "I'll always remember you. " "Farewell, Beatrice. Goodbye, my love. " "Gilles. " It's time for me to be on my way. Goodbye. We would risk chatting until morning. If you allow, I will go through the lounge. I fear your uncle would detain me. He did not say anything. His soul and his heart remain closed. Why am I so happy? I told him "you are distinguished, your voice is so sweet. " Was it awkward? His voice vibrates and caresses. I seem to feel him again. When I told him about my younger sister, he did not understand. It is horrible to be ugly! It is horrible! I know I am not pretty. I know. I know. - Another Sunday... - No, no, Elisabeth, no. That's not it. Don't just say "I know I'm not pretty" We must believe it. You remain too pretty, you're concerned about your own person. You're afraid that the public finds you ugly as Elisabeth. But it's Sonia who's not pretty. You understand? This way it doesn't happen at all. - I'll do it again. - Sure, let's. I thought the way she said it was fine. Where'd she come from? - Who let you in? - Excuse me. - Who are you? - I must speak to you, it's important. It's life or death. Quite by chance, I came across these letters and this photo, while I was cleaning his room. Then I did something I shouldn't. I read the letters. I immediately noticed we were tangled up in a drama. I understood why my brother was increasingly depressed. Because this Miss Beatrice Deschamps, she writes him but won't see him. That's what makes him more and more ill. - Why doesn't she come? - That's the tragedy. It's because she can't. She can't because her mother, Beatrice's mother, is very ill and very old. She doesn't dare leave her for a second. If she knew the crisis she was causing, I suppose she'd come straight away. It would be simpler to just tell her. Impossible. The only person who could do that would be me. Then my brother would know that I'd betrayed his confidence, and read his letters. But what can Elisabeth do? Come for an hour one Sunday, sit down, talk to him. I can provide details on Miss Deschamps' life. She tells him all about it in her letters. What do you think? I don't know, all this sounds complicated to me. That's the least we can say. He's dying. I do look like her. If I tied my hair back... What do you think? Up to you. All right, why not? Thank you, miss. "Gilles, my dear, your blackmail succeeded. " "You win. " "I'll come Sunday at 4 pm but I can't stay long. " "I burn with impatience and am counting the hours that separate us. Yours, Beatrice" Louise, there's something important I've got to tell you. Oh my god... what is it? Basically, I have a friend. - What do you mean, a friend? - A friend. A friend, you understand? - Her name is Beatrice Deschamps. - The good woman of stamps? I just made up the stamps. In fact, there's something else. Really? How did you meet her without stamps? I wrote to her. She put an ad in the paper. So you became friends by correspondence? - Right. - Fine. Why are you telling me this now? Well, here we are, it's... - Because it's Sunday and she's coming. - You want to present her to me? Yes, eventually, but I'm seeing her for the first time, so I'd prefer it... Ah, I see. I'm just in the way. Three's a crowd, right? Listen! Her mother's very ill. She only has a short time. She'll come around 4 pm. 4:00. Good. I'll prepare a snack. Tea or coffee, you tell me. - You're really...! - Yes, wonderful. I'm so wonderful that I might make you a pie. I adore you. Kiss me. - Louise! - I'm coming. Come and help me, hurry! - Where's the fire? - Quick, Louise! There. Well, you're perfect. Very chic! You're a real heartbreaker. - You look like you're getting married. - I would marry her if she wanted to. - You'd leave me at the door? - No! Not at all! You'd come with us. Damn it! It's four o'clock. We'd live in town. We'd all be together. - With her mother. - Not for very long. But tell me, you can't be sure you're going to like her. You've never met. I've got her picture. Oh, a picture's one thing. But the twists and turns we have in real life, that's something else. She looks nice. Dreamy. Romantic. Not just romantic. In her letters, she's a volcano. Oh, please...! - Sorry. - The pie's ready. I also did some sandwiches. So let's agree: I let her in, get her settled, then alert you in your room. Then me, I'll slip away. Discreetly. Quietly. Yes. Wait! As you don't want to be disturbed, how will I know when she's gone? I'm not going to stay behind the door. I'll put the broom in the kitchen window. Good idea. - That'll work? - Use the broom. You're great, Louise. If you meet someone, I swear I'll do the same for you. You know with an old bird like me, you might be waiting a long time before I put any brooms in windows. Look, with my chair, I still managed managed to sort myself, and by mail. It's different for men. She's here. How am I? You're fine. Louise, Louise. Wish me luck. Good luck. Hello, miss. Hello, I'm Miss Deschamps, I've come to see Gilles. I'm Louise, Gilles' sister. I'm delighted to see you. Come in. Whatever happens, don't go back on this. I promise. What could happen? You never know. Take a seat. I'll tell my brother. I've got stage fright, madame. Stage fright! Gilles. It's for you. I've got to go out now, I've got something to do. Goodbye. Hope to see you again. Certainly. Goodbye, miss. - You found us easily? - Yes, I took the bus. Then I walked. How... How's your mother? My mother? She's sick. She's very ill, of course. I shouldn't leave her. The doctor's very pessimistic. Come on, I'll show you my room. - Take your coat off, Beatrice. - It's warm. Yes, it's warm in here. Are you okay? Relax. You have a beautiful view. Beatrice. Gilles, control yourself, let's just talk. I can't speak. Enough now. Stop it! - Gilles. - Yes. So? So how did it go? - You haven't touched it. - She wasn't hungry. You can eat the sandwiches and the pie, if you want. You could have offered the girl some coffee. You've behaved like some boor. Time passed quickly, you know. No, I didn't know. Elisabeth was furious. She came back in such a state. He wasn't at all what you told us. What's all this baloney? You lied to us! She doesn't want to hear any more about you or your swine of a brother. I don't understand. Gilles was happy. He said that everything went well. Is that so? He almost raped her! After showing her disgusting photos. Raped! He's practically nailed to a wheelchair. Funny sort of invalid. It seems he has the arms of a pro wrestler, your dying brother. Who's going to prove it to me that it wasn't the performer, who started up with my brother? You've got some nerve. She rendered a service for you, and for free. You know what he needs? Get him some hookers. Two, three times a week. And leave my actors alone. Clear? "Dear Gilles. " "My mother was in a bad way when I came back. " "from our afternoon of unforgettable madness. " "I felt even more guilty that she had a bad night. " "My darling, my Gilles. " "You see, I can't come back any time soon. " "You can write me, reassure me of your love," "Write me ardent letters," "Passionate. " "Yours, Beatrice. " Sorry, there's nothing for you today, miss. Thank you. Is she going to come back? Who? Well, that Miss Deschamps. I don't know. Next time, I'd like to receive her properly. I owe her a letter. You owe her. You talk like an accountant. Unbelievable. Fine, I'll write to her and ask her to come. That's Yvette, looking for me. No. Nothing. Thank you. - Ah, Miss Deschamps. How are you? - Hello, Madame Guillaume. Fine. Still no letter? Maybe next week. Yes, goodbye, Madame. Goodbye. "Dear Gilles, I am full of grief," "After this terrible week waiting for your letter," "I have more sorrow because my mother died last night. " "She died in bed without saying a word. " "I thought I should write to you and tell you," "that I'm free, I'm finally free, free to come see you," "free to do everything that you want," "Write me, Gilles, and ask me to come. Come. Come. " "Write. " "Your love, Beatrice. " Here. You can mail this while you're out. - It's for Beatrice? - Yes. - She never came back. - No. Her mother died. - Be sure not to forget. - No. - Hello, Madame Guillaume. - Ah, Miss Deschamps. - How are you? - Fine. - Your mail, Madame Guillaume. - Thank you. Could you see if there's any mail for Deschamps? Yes, of course. Deschamps. This is for you. - Thank you. - Oh, that's good. - You finally got it. - Bye. She sent that to herself, she was too sure it was there. "Dear Miss Deschamps," "I'm sad to learn of the death of your mother. " "But your letter has come too late. " "I took a lot of pleasure corresponding with you, but I can't write any more. " "My heart is taken now. " "I've often mentioned my friend Yvette. " "She and I decided to get married. " "I'm sorry about your mother. " "I hope you won't have a bad memory of me. " "Understand me. Don't blame me. Sincerely, Gilles Martin. " Louise! Yes! You're here. - How do you feel, Gilles? - Good. - Hugh! Good morning. - Hi, Louise. - How are you? - You look younger every year. You're daft. Grab a seat. You have enough for all of us? There's enough for four. - It's Champagne. - From Champagne? What's the occasion? They've got something wonderful to tell us. Well, go on! No, not me. It's not for me to say. Yvette, please. Oh no, you can have the honour. Well, when you've all finished being polite... I'll be right here. Louise. Louise. Louise, Yvette and I are getting married. Well, you two are pretty sneaky. You've hidden that well. Congratulations on your game. Is it okay? Do you feel happy? Poor Beatrice. Beatrice? Who's Beatrice? You haven't told her? What didn't you tell me? I wasn't thinking. I'm an idiot. Would you like to explain? It's nothing, really. Her name is Beatrice Deschamps. We met one time. - We wrote letters, not important. - I want to know everything. How long has this liaison been going? It's not a liaison. We wrote letters for a few months. So every time I posted a letter, it was for this... ...for this woman? Yes, yes, but it was mainly her doing the writing. I told her we were getting married. You and me. Have you seen her? Yes, in the end, briefly. Once, some weeks ago. Almost by chance, right, Louise? Yes, absolutely. And what's she like, this Beatrice? Oh, no, you're the fiancee, you're not going to start now. Beatrice is just... Beatrice. It's nothing to do with you. It's his business. He was free to do what he wanted. Including writing. And write to who he liked. There. That's the end of the Beatrice story. Should we open the champagne? Let's go. Good idea. I'll get some glasses. - It's a bit warm. - Come on, Louise! My table, my table! To Yvette. To Gilles. To a long and happy marriage. To Louise and Hugh, our family. Louise! What are you doing? You coming or not? Louise! Louise! Get down here. Just a second. I'm coming. Take the keys in the kitchen and lock the back door. And then put them in my bag. There. I'm ready. What about you? Are you OK? Yes, I'm okay. It's a great day. Oh yes, a great day, my Louise. Don't worry, it'll all go fine. And I'm here. Do you begin this commitment to each other freely and without constraint? - Yes. - Yes. Do you promise loyalty for all of your lives? Yes, for all our lives. In your home will you accept responsibility, as spouse and parent? Yes, we accept this. Exchange your vows. Yvette Marie-Christine Le Goff, will you be my wife? Yes, I want to be your wife. And you, Gilles Yves Jean-Marie Martin, will you be my husband? Yes, I want to be your husband. I receive you as my husband and give myself to you, to love throughout our lives. I receive you as my wife and give myself to you, to love you faithfully throughout our lives. You are now united by God in marriage. Subbed by Badge.
