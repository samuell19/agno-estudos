It's a pretty good gelding. You must be gettin' outa' ranching altogether? Yeah. Is there a car rental place around here? What? - Place to rent cars. - I ain't seen any. train? Oh, now and then. Well, thanks. Appreciate it. You bet. Who the fuck is that? Some big shot from the Bond company. Let's go check him out. I'd like to see Mr. Spence's trailer, please. Ah, his trailer? That's right. It's still here, isn't it? Yes, The trailer is still here. Ah, wouldn't you like to come down and meet the director and the producer first? No, I'd like to see his trailer. His mobile home. - His mobile home. - His mobile home. Sure. Right away. I got the producers on the line. You wanna talk to 'em? No. Let me have the director come down. I'm sure he would be more than happy to come right on down. I don't want to see the director. I don't want to see anyone. I wanna be left alone. Is that clear? Nice talking to you... What a dick. There is every indication that Mr. Spence is engaged in a totally irresponsible, self-indulgent, immoral behavior. Not unlike many members of his profession. Hey! Pull up there a second! Let's see some I.D.? I.D.? You gotta be joking. - Mom? - Howard? Mom? - Howard? Is that you? - Yeah, it's me. - Where in the world are you? - I'm not sure. - Are you in good health? - Yeah, I'm fine, Mom. - Are you far, far away? - No. I think. I mean I think I'm somewhere in Utah, near the border. What border is that, now? Nevada. The Nevada border. You haven't been that close since you went away to do that movie years ago. Yeah. Listen, Mom would you mind if I came by and spend a couple days with you? Well if you're that close and you don't come and stay with me you better not ever, ever call me again. I swear... Mom! You're breaking up on me, Mom! Can you hear me? You're breaking up on me! Okay. Here we go. How many cards does he have? Darn machines... Excuse me, kind of in a hurry here. Yeah. Sorry. We are all waiting. With our one card... Thanks. Say, excuse me, but don't I know you from somewhere? What! What the hell! Attention all passengers. The bus to Elko is now board in gand departing immediately. Adios! You must be sky. Your mother will be very much missed around here. Oh, John. Do you really have to leave? I am sorry. I'm sorry! But I... I can't do this. Cut! Cut! What's going on now? - What's wrong? - I just... I can't do this! - What's wrong, Monica? - I can't do this. I am having a very difficulty me pretending that he is supposed to be Howard. I mean I can't kiss that guy! Who is that guy? That's not Howard. It's just a temporary thing, Monica. Temporary my ass! Where is Howard? When's he supposed to get here? Howard's coming. He's just going to be here soon but what we've got to do is try to continue until he gets here. Why? I am supposed to be acting with Howard Spence, not some stand-in jerk-off. The bond company wants us to keep shooting. Fuck the bond company! - Wow! Hang on! Just wait a minute! - Just get out of my way, ok. - Do you want any water... - I'm going to my trailer. I'm calling my agent. Leave me alone! I haven't got anything left to shoot. Just some inserts. Inserts will take half a day. What we need is Howard! We need Howard here and we need Howard here now! Mom! Howard. What in the wide world has become of you? - Are you my son? - Yeah. It's me, Mom. Is that all your luggage? Oh, I'm traveling light. You didn't have to bring any flowers. I didn't. These aren't for you! What would you do with a bunch of plastic roses? Come on, let's get going. Sold the old ranch house? I had to when your father died... So, You're not living in the country anymore? No. I moved ten years ago. I don't know what to do with you, Mom. It all happened so fast. I mean, I remember you talking about that place. That place out near where you grew up. You were always talking about that, like you were happy there or something. When I was a kid. You remember that? Always seemed like you liked that place. I thought maybe. I'd take you up there. Well, what were you thinking about? Nothing. So, now they'll be looking for you, is that it? Yeah. I guess. And you want me to hide you out or something? "Just like Jesse James?" Yeah, "Just like Jesse James." Well, I suppose I could do that. You are my son, aren't ya'? I just need a place to rest for a while, Mom. Might as well be the place you grew up in. Yeah. You know, I always have the same damn problem finding your father's grave site. Well don't you recognize the stone, Mom? Well. They'reall alike. I mean, they used up all them pretty little white arches during Vietnam. Then, by the time your father died, all they had were these simple slabs of granite. Just a slab flat on the grou... Here it is. - Is that it? - Yes. I never thought it was appropriate a flat slab on the ground. People just walk right on top of it. Dogs pee on it. It just isn't right. Gentlemen, I can shoot around Howard for another day or two, but... That doesn't solve the problom. I Well, you know, Mr. Daily, sir. I don't see exactly how the director or any of us, for that matter, can beheld totally accountable for Howard's actions. Well somebody has to be held has to be held accountable, don't they, Jim? I mean, Mr. Daily's company has insured us for 30 million - Thirty two point, five. - Well, yes, of course. But Howard has a long history of this kind of behavior. I don't think he's ever completely disappeared before though, has. No, no. He's never done that before... We gave the guarantee of completion, didn't we? Yes, we did, Mr. Sutter. Well, then we'll find him. There's no question. We'll definitely find him. What kind of trouble are you in, Howard? Trouble? Oh, it's nothing, Mom. You know, I might end up owing a little bit of money. That's all. No, I don't mean... I don't mean that. Then what? Well, a man doesn't go off for nigh thirty years without a word then show up at his mother's door unless there's some kind of serious trouble. No, I just... I just needed to see you Ma. I understand that part. I mean, I thought it'd dome some good to come back here and just stay for a while, you know. Have you been doing all that stuff what they said about you in the magazines? What stuff? You know, that stuff... like carousing around. You know the magazines are magazines are just full of gossip. I don't give two hoots about it. I'm just curious. No, I haven't been doing anything... I haven't been doing any of that stuff. Because if you were doing all that stuff, it's no wonder you're not feeling so hot. I feel fine. With just the sheer exhaustion of it. I wasn't doing anything! It's just that. that things came up and they kind of snowballed and... What, what things? Well, you know... opportunities. Opportunities are supposed to be a good thing, aren't they? Yeah, but not always though. Sometimes... What the hell are you are you staring at! Come on, Mom, let's get sometimes when out of here. Well, I haven't finished my coffee. I've just gotta get some air. You'll have to excuse my son. He's lost his manners. That happens people stray too far from home, Susy. Don't worry about it, Lulu. I don't know why you're so upset about this, Mom. I mean... Rudeness is one thing I've never been able to tolerate, Howard. I mean... I don't understand rudeness. I know, Mom, it's nothing. It's over. The man was staring at me. It's rude to stare. Well so be it. You didn't need to take his head off. Well, I apologize. Well, it's embarrassing, Howard... just embarrassing. Well I'm sorry... Sorry. So there... I prepared a room for you downstairs. I hope it'll fit you. I just... I just don't have all the space we had in the old ranch house. No. I'll be fine, Mom. I'll be fine. Oh it's handy to the kitchen and there's a bivy right down the hallway. Where do you sleep? Just down the hall. So, if you need anything, you just holler. Well, thanks, Mom. Yes. Sure. - Good night. - Good night. Oh, where is the basement? - Right through the kitchen. - Okay. - Night, night. - Good night. There's jam and bread in the kitchen Howard! If you're hungry. I don't know if you're hungry or not. I'm alright, Mom! Well, if you're hungry, you just help yourself! Thanks! Would you believe? Hey, Ma! I think I'm gonna go out and get some air, alright? Have a nice time! What'll it be buddy? let me have a coke, please. Are you in the movies? My friend says you're in the movies. Change for a hundred. And... no more bets. No more bets, please. Here is your martini. - Thank you, dear. - Anything for you? Hmmm... let me have a "Jim Beam" on the rocks. I'll be right back. What is so god damn fascinating about me, huh? Howard, Howard... Why do you keep dogging me around? Howard, it's me! It's me, Cliff! Cliff Ormsby! Cliff Ormsby? Yes, Plains High, 1959 1959? Yeah. Don't you remember me? I don't remember anything. Nothing that ever happened back then happened to me. Okay? Alright. God damn it! Hey! I was looking for you. There you are! I thought you might've skipped out on me. Mr. Spence seems to have done a good job cutting himself off completely from family and friends. I have no traces to immediate family, except his mother. Er, she lives in Elko, Nevada. - That's very good, Miss Rontz. - Thank you, sir. That's excellent work. Thank you. Mothers are always the last refuge, aren't they? Sure are, sir. Just a tick... Ah, oh, Sir are you there, are you still there? Sir? And you can contact the car rental company and tell them that we've located Mr. Spence's car... Very good. at the Rio Grande bus terminal... Er, Rio Grande? Where is that, sir? - Here in Salt Lake City. - Alright. I'll be back in touch shortly. - Thanks very much... - Sweaty. - Excuse me. - That's right. The Fight of Your Life. Alright. I'm ready. Are you ready? I'm ready. Ready? Alright. What the hell do you think you're doing? Take it easy! Take it easy! Hey! Hey! Give me your arm. God damn you! Give me your... Just hang on a second. Would you? - I need to take a pee. - You can take a pee at the station. I've been having to pee for a longtime. Damn it, I... that machine is crazy. You guys aren't from around here are you? I grew up in this town. My dad ranched right up here in the Ruby Mountains. God damn it! Don't you guys recognize me? I've been in the movies. - I'm an actor. - Why don't you tell that to the judge? Yeah. He likes movies. I've been in lots of lots ofWesterns. This is my hometown. Yeah. I know it, Cowboy. Coming to tayayayeh, right? Alright, right there. Morning, Charlie. Morning Mrs. Spence. What's happened to Howard? Well, he was having a little too much fun last night. Weren't you, Howie? You keep an eye on him now, Mrs. Spence. Oh, I will. Don't you worry about that, Charlie. Tell you the truth, I didn't hardly recognize him at all. I mean haven't seen him in so long. Of course I guess we've all gotten a little bit longer in the tooth now, haven't we? - I guess so, Charlie. - Yeah, it happens. Yeah. - Bye. - Bye, bye. Yes, it happens. Did you have any fun out there, last night? Haha, fun? Yeah. Girls? Drinking and gambling? No... Mom. Well, it's supposed to be fun, isn't it? I mean that's what they claim. People come from miles around to have fun. That's what I thought it was, anyway. It's just designed to be fun. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what to do with myself, anymore. Aren't you gonna' eat your eggs? No. I'm not feeling so hot. Well, hand the mover then. No sense in wasting'em. They look good. Oh, thank you. A fork... Yeah, you don't happen to have any pictures of your little family, do you? Mom and Howard My... my... my family? The child you never told me about. My grandson. And I had to find it out from his poor mother back then. What child! Now don't tell me you gave it up for adoption or something stupid like that? I don't know about any child. - You don't know? - No. How'd you get to be such a mess, Howard? A woman called me, years ago. Back, just after you'd finished that... big motion picture of yours up there in Montana. The Western. Said she was pregnant with your baby. What woman was this? I don't know what woman? You're the one who got her pregnant. I never... I never got any body pregnant! Well, she said that you did. She had a pretty strong notion about it. What did she want? She wanted to know if I'd seen you. Course I hadn't. I never saw you again after that. And you were just a total stranger. She called from somewhere up in Montana. I remember that. Montana? I got... I gotta lie down, Mom. Oh... okay... don't you want your orange juice, then? No. Thanks. Mrs. Spence. I'm looking for your son. My son? I haven't seen him in over thirty years. Ever since he became a big movie star. I mean you'd think he'd at least drop his mother a card now and then, wouldn't you? Yes, you would. So you haven't heard from him in thirty years. - Not a phone call? - Na ah. - Not an email? - What's an email? Oh, you must be with the movie company outfit, is that it? Sort of. Well, Mrs. Spence, here's my card and if you do happen to hear from your son, could you give me a call? My numbers are all there. Oh, I'd be glad to. I'd appreciate that. - Bye, bye. - Goodbye, now. Howard! The coast is clear! I remember your father barreling down those long, dusty roads in this thing, heading back from the cattle auctions. You could see him from miles away Just a plume of dust. Like a giant rooster. It was quite excitin', actually. It's a beauty, Mom. Does it still run? Oh, I use it every week for shopping, but... but I can walk just as easy. You're sure? Well, let me know now and then where you're stayin'. - Keep in touch. - I will, Mom. Oh, I packed some things of your father's for you. Thanks. Don't be a stranger! No. I'll give you a call. Runs like a top. You look good. - Bye, Howie! - Bye, Mom. Have you seen this man? Yeah. Yesterday. Thank you. Excuse... Excuse me. Sorry. Pardon me. Excuse... Excuse me. Sorry. Ah... Excuse me. Sorry. You got a room for one night? Well, this must be your lucky day, Mister. We have one room left. Oh, good. It is a 'smoking' room though, if that's all right. Yeah that's fine. Thanks. Ah, you take cash money? Yes, we certainly do. Ah, what's your name? Ah, Spence. Howard Spence. Are you here on business, Mr. Spence? No, I'm not. - Howard Spence? - Yeah. The Howard Spence? No. No. No. People mistake me for him. Hey, Mom! It's me again. I'mon the road. Where are you heading now, Howard? Well, I thought I'd go up to Montana and try to find that woman. What woman is that? Well, you know, the one you told me about. The woman with the baby. Oh, yes of course. You don't remember her name? Do you? - Her name? - You got a name? How would I remember a name after thirty years? It wasn't... was it 'Doreen'? What's that? Doreen! She used to work as a waitress up there. It was so long ago. Well, it certainly was, Howard, where are you calling from? God, I mean, the kid must be thirty almost by now. Where does the time go? It's unbelievable. What's all that noise? I hope you see this thing through, Howard. You owe it to that woman. Oh, excuse me. Someone is at the door. Goodbye, Howard. Coming! Good evening, Mrs. Spence. - It's you. - Yes, it's me. Sorry to be such a nuisance. Would you like to come in and have some cookies and milk? Cookies? What kind? Peanut butter, with little chips of butterscotch. I'll try one. Oh, just come on in then and help yourself. I've just baked them. Oh, that's very kind of you, Mrs. Spence. - Are you staying in Elko, Mr... - Sutter. Mr. Sutter. Sutter? Ah, no. I'm just passing through. That's about all you can do here, isn't it? Just pass on through. Here. You lied to me, didn't you, Mrs. Spence? I beg your pardon? You deliberately lied to me about your son. He was here all along, wasn'the? I don't know what in the world you're talking about. I've never told anything but the truth in my whole life. Lying is for cowards, Mr. Sutter. Hmm? Excellent cookies. Housekeeping! Oh, shit! Oh. Hey! Hey! Come on, everybody up... up, up, up. Everybody outta here! God damn it. Oh, my God. Here, Get your stuff. Come on. Whose stuff is this? Come on. Get outa' here! Let's go. Come on. Everybody out. Here we go. Is that yours? Come on, come on, come on... What do you want? Would you like me to come back later, sir? Yeah! No! Don't come back! Don't ever come back! Hey, wait a second! Is this... wait! That's yours? - Thanks, Howie. - Bye. Ah, great. Great. You've done it again. Ahhh god! Nice. Nice. Way to go. Terrific. Oh, God. Oh, boy. Just see if you can get to Montana. You want me to freshen that up? Can I help you, sir? Oh, just a cup of coffee, thanks. - You want Coffee mate with it? - Yeah. Sure. I'm probably not going to get out of here until midnight so... Can I get a room for a couple of nights? Yes, sir. No problem. Ah, would you fill this out, please? You take cash, I hope. Absolutely. Here is your room key. You're in 201, just down the hall. Ancient history now. This place is just full of ghosts. Are you from out of town? Ah, yeah, sort of. My Mom was from Butte. She was? What was her name? Oh, you wouldn't know her. She kind of... she came and went a lot. Ahh, yeah. Well, she's not alone. There's only a few of us die-hards left here. What movie was this? It's a Western? Yeah. It was shot right around here, wasn't it? Right here. Yep. Must have been really exciting. Yeah, well. For about five minutes. And then "real life" came back and took its place. Yeah. I don't know I thinker... I think I like the movies better. Than what? Than real life. Well, you let me know if you want some coffee or something, huh, honey? Thanks. Strike a pose, imagining loud and ecstatic, applause. Simply because... you are on pause. Strike my face so we can see if it leaves some kind of mark. No, it's too dark. My, it's dark. Excuse me. Ah, Ginger Ale, please. Well, it took you long enough. Thank you. Thank you folks. This next song is for everybody who's ever been shaken, rattled and rolled... He's got a pretty good voice, don't you think? Dedicated to Bill Haley. Okay guys. - Where have you been, Howard? - One, two, three. one, two, three Where in the world have you been? I don't know. Just kinda' fell off the face of the earth, huh? Yeah. You know, I looked for you for a while. I tried to find you. I looked everywhere. - I even tracked down your mother. - My mother? Yeah. Didn't she tell you? No, I haven't seen her for a good long while. That's too bad, Howard. You should never lose track of your mother. So, what are you doing back up here? Oh, you know. Just kind of... kind of passing through. Just... passing through? On a whim? Yeah, I thought I'd just drop back through... Well, ifyou're looking for your son... That's him. Right there in front 'a you. It's really good to see you again, Howard. Wait a second! Can I get you a drink or some... Doreen! Thank you. Thank you, guys, Thanks. We'll take a short break. Come back. Tip the bartender... Thanks.
