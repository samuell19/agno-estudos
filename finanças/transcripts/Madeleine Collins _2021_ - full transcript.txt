Visit the new spring collection on the third floor of our store. Clothes, shoes, handbags, accessories. Discover elegance with a contemporary twist. Hello, Ma'am. Would you like to try it on? - No, it's really not my style. - It is a very unusual cut. But with your figure, it would look great. - Do you know the store? - No, I only moved here a month ago. This one is stunning, too. I'm looking for something more classic. Let's see what my colleague here has. Come with me. This lady's looking for a formal dress. What do we have? It all depends on your budget. Is it for a special occasion? No, my mother gave me some money to buy myself something. It wouldn't have occurred to me. Shall we try to find something that will make both of you happy? Would something like this... Yes, it's sublime. It is rather an expensive item. It costs 2,690 francs. That's more than I can afford. Otherwise, there's everything here and on the rail over there, where you'll find more affordable items. I'll come with you. - May I try this? - Of course. This one? - Yes. - Yes? And this one as well. Fine. This way to the fitting rooms. Could I also ask you for the one your colleague showed me? The fishnet one. - Certainly. - Just to see. Here, this one's your size. I'll go fetch the others. Thanks. - Corinne? - Yes? Could I have the fishnet dress, please? - Of course. - Thanks. - Here it is. - Thanks. ... with reductions of up to 50% in all our stores in French-speaking Switzerland. I have the size below, if that one's too big. Ma'am? Ma'am, how's the fit? I have the size below if you want it. Ma'am? Corinne! Corinne! Call security! I need someone from security at the fitting rooms. A customer has fainted. - Wake up, please! - Hurry. Are you all right? It's nothing. I hit my head when I fell, but I'll be all right. There's a chair, I'll help you up. It must be low blood pressure. It often happens to me. - There, sit down. - I passed out this time. Thanks. I banged my head very hard. It'll be all right. It'll be all right. Thank you. I'll leave you to recover. I'll be right outside. Get dressed when you feel ready. Thanks. - I'll put them back. - Yes. - A customer fainted. She's over there. - OK. Ma'am? Is everything all right? I... I'm very sorry, I... - Are you OK? - Yes. You can stay here. It's not a problem. Or someone could go with you to the infirmary. How about that? Just say. I'm Christiane. If there's anything you need... Thank you, but I'll be all right. I'll come back... I'll come back later. Whatever you like, Ma'am. There's no hurry. Thanks. What happened? I don't know. The lady fainted. What's that noise? What happened? Her face is all bloody! Call a doctor! We can't find a pulse. She's covered in blood. Your hair's all dusty. This one. - Shall we climb it? - Ninon? Now we're at the bottom. We'll have to climb the whole mountain. We will. - There are great big houses. - Ninon? Ninon? Come along, darling, let's go. - Let me put your toys in my bag. - No, they'll suffocate. I see. What shall we do, then? I'll keep them in my hands, then, shall I? Mommy won't put them in her bag, I'll keep them with me. You take that. Shall we go, sweetheart? Oh, you're tired... Come on, we'll be late. Attagirl! Did you see that? Angel? Angel? Sweetheart? I don't, but that isn't a problem. If it suits you, I can be there next week with my truck. Great. So I wait for Munich to call? Yes, thank you, Sir. Bye. - Are they hiring you? - Looks like it. Thank your colleague again. - It's embarrassing. - Oh, Abdel! The pictures are worth more than this house, but that doesn't change what you do. - It's a transport job, that's all. - I'm embarrassed for you. - Asking your colleague on my behalf. - But she doesn't mind. Really. - Don't go. - It'll be good to work again. Yes. Ninon, I'll call you before you have your bath, as usual. And you know what? - Shall I bring something from Spain? - No. You know, sweetheart, I'm going to work. It'll be the two of us. - My angel. - I don't want you to... I'll be here on Monday for your first class. We'll all be here for your dance class. Meanwhile, do you remember? One kiss per day on each finger. One, two, three, four, five. You can take one kiss per day. OK? Yes. - Won't you be late? - I will. I missed the one before. - I don't want her to go. - I know. In English it's "if I were". You use "were" with the first person. - No, it's right. - Miss, would you mind? Excuse me. One moment, don't hang up. One moment. For "oblivion" we could put abandon . It's not exactly the same... but it's close. Yes. Yeah. - Here. - Thanks. You're losing too much weight, Jeff, don't overdo it. Don't worry, I got plenty in reserve. See you. Ciao. It's me. - We're going to be late. - Hello. Sorry, it came out wrong. I'll start again. Hello, Mme Fauvet, Hello, my love. How are you, star of my nights, sun of my days? How were these last few days that kept me apart from you? - Don't spread it too thick. - How were the Lithuanians? Jordanians. It was fine. I'm not sure I understand everything I translate. Tell me. - Shall I wear something more formal? - No, that's fine, you... I'm the one on view this evening. Don't upstage me. I forbid you to be too beautiful. Wear something gray and dull. Let me do that. - Shall I drive? - No, it will relax me. Can we drive at 180 in town? Your son called. You mean "our son". Not when he annoys me. Which one? One of the two. Can you tell them apart? Did I tell you the real estate agency called? Which agency? - Can we put something else on? - No, it calms me down. The agency on the boulevard. I called them. Did you? Why? I don't know. I... I thought a new house would be nice. For us. As a love nest for us. OK. But... When did you have the idea? I don't know. A while ago. I want a change. I want to decide what to do here, what to put there. As if we were 18. You don't set up house at 18, you live with your parents. - Yes, but... You see what I mean. - I do, yes. - Aren't you pleased? - I am. I've arranged to view one on Monday. It's sublime. Monday. Next Monday? See you later. I love you. A lot. - Hello, Mme Fauvet. - Hello, Judith. - Hello, how are you? - Fine. You? - I'm well, thanks. - Do you mind? - No problem. - Is it too early to get a gin? - Give me one minute. - Thanks. - Yes? Hold on. - It's me. How are things? Did she cry a lot? A little. But now it's all right. I won't be able to get back for Monday. I can't make it before Tuesday. Melvil has arranged something. - Never mind. - I'll tell you. Could she go to a different class, later in the week? I don't like missing... I won't change it now, Jude. Nin, put that down! - Don't worry. - Yes, but it's important. - She won't understand... - It's only a dance class. OK. - Why did you call earlier? - Nin! It's not important. Tell me. It's nothing. Really. - We'll talk about it later. OK? - You sound funny. Is she in the bath yet? Can I talk to her? - I'm going to draw tomorrow. - How are you, sweetheart? I'm in Spain. Is everything all right? When are you coming back? Was he very stressed? With all the bigwigs here? He laughs it off. You'd never know. He's perfect. That's the way he is. Get used to it. - Patty. - Nice to meet you. - Hello, Mom. - Hello. You have no dress sense. That dress flattens your butt. It's not very flattering. Thanks. Hello, Dad. How are the boys? Are they in the mountains? - Yes. - Hello, darling. Sorry. We were late leaving. - Never mind. - This is exciting. So many people. - Shall we meet up later? - Aren't we together? We're with the Gedalges. On the balcony. You know I don't like to be too near. See you later. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you. Sorry. Hello. Hello. - How are you? - A little stressed. Excuse me. Are you all right, Ma'am? - Could you find the medicine in my bag? - Of course. - Is this it? - Thanks. - Shall I get some water? - There's no need. Shall I stay with you a while? Do you want me to call a doctor? What's your name? Pol. Like Paul but with an "O". And you? I feel better. I'll go back inside. I'm joking. I'm delighted, really. - Thanks, Madeleine. - I'll be right back. Your man did well, didn't he? Of course he did. He always does, what can I do about it? I know relations with Barnetti are strained. But he's waited 10 years for this contract. If he doesn't get it, I'll be angry. On decision day, I'll put all my weight behind him. I lost three kilos, but it should be enough. What are those crappy earrings? If you buy me a present, I wear it. Cut it out, I have lousy taste. Take it, say thank you and then sell it online. - Are the boys still on vacation? - They just arrived. It seems fine. You should send Jacob next year, because the place is... really great. You said the performance was good, but you left at the beginning. Yes. - But only for a few minutes. - I had... A sort of dizzy spell. I often do. I think it's low blood pressure. It's nothing serious, but... Anyway. I watched the rest and you were... sublime. Here, smoke this for me while I watch. Low blood pressure? What's that all about? I don't know. Ole! It makes a sound. It's not easy, is it? Maybe you're still too small. The district where I bought them reminded me of you. It's called La Niña. Ninon: La Niña. - How was your dance class yesterday? - I want to go with you on your trips. Well, you know what? The next time, or one of the times, you can. We'll do everything together, go everywhere. Yes? I'll do it. - Let me. - I don't mind. I'd rather do it. - I'm going to draw a sun. - What a good idea. It's 25 past already. I still have a quarter of an hour. I meant to tell you. I did something crazy. I bought a little bureau. A Louis XV with curved legs. To put there. I'll take up less space, working. You too. We can both use it. You're buying furniture now? - What do you mean "Now"? - Nothing. I'm surprised you're buying furniture for here. I thought it would be convenient for... For working. It is. No, it is... It is convenient. I'll take you now, Nin. Drawing's over. Come along. Put your shoes on. They're there. - They're here. - Get ready. Here. Sweetheart. Put them on. Is everything OK? Yes. It's almost time, that's all. What's the matter? Nothing. Really? What was it about on the phone the other day? Why keep telling her all these stories? Spain, Italy, all of that? What's the point? Why say you'll take her when you know it's not true? Well... I don't know. I have to say something, don't I? I don't like it. Not anymore. She's thrilled each time you come and devastated when you go. It's really tough for her. I don't think we... - We can't go on like this. - Why not? One day, you might not come back here. Why wouldn't I? Maybe if you... decide being there is more important. Abdel, I don't know what you're talking about. Regarding the Formosa canal, the position of the Taiwanese administration is very clear, although the situation with its Chinese counterpart is making things... Sorry. Yes, we need to clear up this point. The Chinese... The Taiwanese government... Sorry. Could we start again, please? I was saying, we do need to clear up this point. Judith! I hoped I'd bump into you. How are you? Was it all OK? Did Abdel call the museum? - Yes, they hired him. - Great. Listen, I don't know how to thank you. That's easy. I always say yes to dinner invitations. - But... - I'm joking. - There's no need. - Let's do something soon. - OK. - I'd love to. I'd like to see Abdel again. - He seems like a gem. - I'm lucky. Pierre-Paul's going to cook next week for his colleagues. Come along. Abdel can thank him in person, because he arranged it all, not me. Yes, I'll... Fantastic! - Great. - Judith! - Val! - Yes. Cory told me he'd seen you here. - So you live in Switzerland now? - Yes, I do. Not in France anymore? - Is Melvil with you? - No. Sorry, I interrupted you. I'm Valerie. I'm a former colleague and we haven't seen each other for years. - For ages. - A long time. - We work together, too. - Helene Rivaz. - Nice to meet you. - We must catch up. - You just vanished. - Sure. - Are the boys with you? - Excuse me. The Jordanians are already there. Come on, let's go! - I must dash. - No problem. Let's catch up next time. Will you be here? - I'm here for a few days. - OK, fine. - Great to see you. - Me too. See you soon. - Ciao. - See you. Are you still the translator? OK. - There. I'll do one. - I'm going to tidy up. Do the bouquet. When I come back I want to see... - Navy blue. - At least three flowers. OK? - One flower. - Don't you want your dessert? Where's daddy? - Ask your father, darling. - He said to ask you. That was smart. So I'm the bad guy. Because the answer's no? Joris, don't go in that boy's car. He drives like a maniac. - I love you alive. - Where are you? Darling, I'm dining with people from work. I must go. That really sucks. I love you too. - See you on Friday. - Yeah. - You can tell me about the mountains. - OK. Ciao. "He crossed the forest, hopping from rock to rock, "followed by a blue doe and a red rabbit..." You see? The two of them. When you go to other countries, are you still my mommy? What do you mean, Nin? Of course I am. When I'm asleep I won't hear you. No. Will you watch me fall asleep? I'll stay here if you like. I don't want you to go. I'm here. I'll never go away. Hello, hi! Judith, I asked you for that speech tonight! Hi, good evening. I'm on it. This is blocking everything. I really need it. I'm counting on you. Yes, good evening. Please, don't. Let's not start that again. Why not? Where are we going with this? - Where? - I don't know. When you're not here, I'm still a person, you know. I have another life. Without you. Alone. I can't keep waiting for you. I can't build my life on that. I need something more. I need someone to be with me. All the time. But... I don't understand. You know I can't talk to Melvil right now. Yes, I know. I know. But Melvil isn't stupid. What do you mean? I mean that it isn't the problem. It's not what I want. I'm talking about me and about Nin. We've gone too far and it isn't good for her. I'm sorry. I'm sorry if I'm not doing the right thing, or... I'm trying. You're hard to read. It works so well, the three of us. Really. - What time did you arrive? - Two or three hours ago. Hold on. And you? How's Poland? I don't get to see anything. I'm out by the airport. Tell me, has the house we viewed fallen through? Yes, but I saw another yesterday, before I left. We can view it when you return. Is 4 p.m. OK? Yes, that's fine. Melvil? - What was that, darling? - Nothing. No, nothing. Listen, I... I'm going. My conference with the NGO is due. - I'm right outside. They're waiting. - OK. I'll let you go. - OK. - Come with me next week. I'll be in Madrid for three days. Can you make it? It seems ages since we finished a sentence. - We're always so faraway. - I came to London a few weeks ago. Blah-blah-blah. I love you, Judith. What was your name again, please? Soriano. Margot. What was that? Margot Soriano. I've found it. Your ID card, please. How silly, I forgot it. I left it on the table. I'm sorry. Without some ID, I can't give you the package. Here it is. There. That's great. Sign here, please. There. Bye. Yes, that's right. No, it's more of an editorial issue. No, I think the lawyer should be briefed. And if he doesn't agree, we should find someone else. Excuse me. Can you give me a minute? One minute, please. Thanks. What's up? Why don't you come in? - Are you OK? - Yes. It smells like you've been drinking. I thought you were sleeping upstairs. No, I have a conference call, to prepare for next week. I have to finish it. I'll sleep in the lounge. Why? I'm not alone. You must have expected it might happen. Yes. I mean, no. No. But take the bedroom upstairs. I'll sleep here. But... Abdel, what's going on? - It's nothing. - Good evening. I'll go, it's not a good idea. I'm sorry. - No. - But it's... It's my house. Do stay, please. - What? - Well... - I can't. Who is she? - She's no one. It's not a problem. Come on, stay. Are you here? Judith? Are you here? - Just a minute, please. - Okay. MELVIL: I'M THINKING OF YOU IN YOUR LITTLE POLISH HOTEL. GOODNIGHT. HOUSE TOMORROW! Judith, are you here? Mom, we already looked at this room. - You could put in a partition here. - Yes. - Here's the layout. - Thanks. It's hardly surprising I'm angry. For 18 months you've been away 3-4 days each week. I'd like to be with you. What's next, 5-6 days? You're always away, too. I don't go on about it. Don't you like the ceiling? I love the moldings. But you should. You should go on about it. Joris, don't look like that. - I'm not. - Do you think I can't tell? I know it's because of the car the other day. Drop it, will you? I must call the Jordanians. I'll be right back. I'll go back up. Whatever you think, I love it. We're in trouble because I love it. You've reached Abdel Soriano. Please leave a message. It's me. I wanted to give Nin a kiss before her bath. Tell her I'm here and I have something for her. Lots of kisses. For both of you. I love you both a lot, you know. I... Let's not spoil it. For Ninon's sake. She's so young. She's so vulnerable. That's all. Lots of kisses. One more thing. Will you read her a bedtime story? The blue doe book. She loves it. Pierre-Paul's dinner is tomorrow. You know, Helene's husband. I hope you remembered, it's important. To thank him. That's all. I... Lots of kisses. Okay, so you get back to me. I'll do it. Thank you. That was Peter. They say it's looking good. I should get a call from him soon, it's... The wait's grueling. You need strong nerves. It's sublime. The view over the garden is fantastic. - Amazing. - Yes. Aren't you interested in my Jordanians? What about your Jordanians? What am I supposed to ask? I don't know. Don't you want to know what Warsaw's like? - You never ask about anything. - You said you stayed by the airport. Anyway, who wants to know about Warsaw? I don't know. Maybe I'm just trying to... That must be Peter. Yes. You look different with your hair down, it's... That's the intention. Did you think about what we discussed in London? What? If I get the job, I'll be away even more, for recordings and so on. We can't both be away all the time, can we? Will you be away as much as you have been lately? - Mom, can I have a cookie, please? - Yes, sweetheart. Here. If I return when you're abroad, or about to go, we could be apart for ages. Would that be fair on the children? You must be sick of all the coming and going. Not at all, no. All you need do is stop working yourself. Do you think my work is just an accessory? That I go to conferences for fun, instead of knitting? That I'd be the same? - What is this bullshit? - Don't get angry. It's just a thought. - I don't know. - I can tell. - What is this toxic machismo? - Wait, don't make out... They just called to offer a long-term post. Maybe even a partnership. It may mean working even more. Joris! What happened? Joris, what's the matter? I want to get out. - Are you out of your mind? - You scared me to death. I didn't mean to. "Didn't mean to"? I almost left the road! You're sick! Darling, shall we pull over? What do you mean? In the garden at the house. While we were there? I called the Jordanians about work. Hold on, you said: "Lots of kisses, I love you." Don't be silly. I called Madeleine after. She was with her son, Jacob. You know him. Why? Are you spying on me? You're smoking now? Strange, isn't it? To discover things you didn't expect. Am I wrong? What are you playing at? What is it, Joris? Is it a test? Are you... Are you threatening me? How should I react? I don't understand. React how you like. Only it's strange to hear your mother tell folk, "Kisses, I love you." - That's all. - What do you mean? I was on the phone with Madeleine. You're imagining things. With Terence the other day, I wouldn't let you go in his car, but that's all. - I didn't say you can't see him. - What's the connection? Nothing. I... I know you're fond of each other. You like him, don't you? I like to discover things about you, too. Even things I didn't expect. I'm finding out about you. It's mutual. But I was simply on the phone. - Mom? - Yes, sweetheart? - I can't sleep. - I'm coming. Get some sleep. Stop brooding all the time. I love you. Maybe he'd like you to be around more. The traveling was only supposed to last a few months. I know you love your job, but couldn't you work in France again? Things can't always be the way you want. Maybe there are some things I want for myself. Even if they don't match your agenda, what you want. I like working there. The fact that... they send me places. Don't I have the right? Sure, but Switzerland made sense before. It meant you could see Abdel. I understand. But, today, we hardly ever go there. - Then, the trips everywhere. - Please. Let's not start all over again. I'm not in the mood. He called me a week ago. We talked for a few minutes. Abdel. I was surprised. Really? What did you talk about? Oh, he was very pleasant. He invited me over. That's all. You know what surprised me even more? No. He said you'd visited him. You didn't tell me. Well, I only stayed a few hours. When I was visiting head office in Geneva. I do see him from time to time. But you don't tell me. Isn't that strange? I don't know. I'm sorry, but I was away a lot lately. Why are you telling me that he called you? Maybe to see if you would talk about it. How was he? And the child? I don't know. I didn't stay long. I'm not sure he was pleased to see me. It's not easy for him to see us. You have to... I don't know. I'll take a shower. I start early tomorrow. Where the fuck is Judith? It's nice of you, but... I have to go back. Thanks for the cigarette. Is something wrong? No, I... I still have two or three minutes. - So, do you work here? - Yes. Yes, but I just finished. Grab me while you can. I'm going back to Montreal. Shall I take you? You'll pick up the accent in no time. It'll suit you. Not only am I married but I also have a young daughter. That's nothing. I'll rough your husband up very courteously. We'll deal with the marriage and child later. My name's Georges by the way. Margot. Let me bum a cigarette. It's for later. - Thanks. - Margot what? Pol. Like "Paul" but with an "O". - Excuse me, I must dash. - Sure. I thought you'd known each other for a long time. No, it's totally new to me. I'm not at all familiar with the art world. I'm here to impress. How am I doing? - Grand. - Great. You and your wife make an attractive couple. - Thank you. - We're not married, but thanks anyway. - I'm sorry. - It doesn't matter. - Did Louis arrive? See you later. - See you shortly. You didn't tell me you called Melvil. No. Is that so unbelievable? No. You could have told me. - Helene... - Georges! Lovely to see you. - Me too. - After so long. - Yes. - Come in. I'll introduce you. Everyone's here, now. We can sit down to eat right away. What an amazing coincidence. You're visiting friends. And they're the same friends as mine. Are you ready to be roughed up? - I'm sorry? - I'm joking. It's an offhand way of saying your wife is stunning. - Thanks. Why are you here? - I could ask you the same, Margot. - So, you know Pierre-Paul too. - My name's Judith. - Why do I think it's Margot? - You must have misheard. I work with Helene. OK. Perhaps. You should know. It's an amazing coincidence all the same. Why did you tell him your name's Margot? I don't know why he said that. He's crazy. Do you often do this? Abdel, the man is crazy. I never said that, or else it was a slip of the tongue. But I'm sure I never said that. This has gone too far. What's going on in your head? But I never said that. Are you coming? We'll be right there. I want us to stop. - We'll explain to Ninon. Do you hear? - I don't want to discuss it here. How do I get you to discuss it? Tell me. - She's happy with the situation. - What? The problems it creates don't matter. You're happy with the situation. You don't think about her. I do, all the time. Please. - She's suffered. - She's growing up. She'll be curious. We can't keep acting. It scares me. I can't go on like this. Tonight, we'll talk to her. I can't. Let me have a little more time. When? I don't know. I love you. I don't know why I said that was my name. It just slipped out. I'm sorry. Margot. Margot. - Show me Abdel's photo again. - Yes. - There. - Great. You'd buy a house with him, wouldn't you? Yes, absolutely. A tiny house so you can snuggle up real close. We viewed a magnificent one. Four bedrooms... - Let me take these. - The outage means I can't scan them. I'll trust you. Margot, I renewed your card when the power was on. - Thanks. - Did you see your ID card had expired? What? So it has. I didn't notice the time go by. Martine and I told you: have a brother or sister for Ninon now. You never notice the time go by. Martine adored you. She asked me for your number. After you left, it was "Margot, Margot..." I've come to see Kurt. I've been here before. The expiry date was too soon. Hello. It's nice to see you. I've only had it a month and it expired. I wanted to be sure you'd come back. I usually put five years. I saw you weren't paying attention. Now you're here. That's good. For 500 francs, it should last longer. I... - I won't pay that every month. - I didn't ask you to. - Do you want a drink? - I don't have time. I just want my papers, and to know how much this time. Why do you talk to me like that? I'm nice to you. You ignore me. There's nothing nice about making me come back for my card. I've no wish to get to know you any better. I did it because I wanted you to come back soon. Do you think I treat everyone like that? I don't. I'm in a hurry. Just tell me how much and let's wrap it up. How much. That's all you say. You don't find my idea romantic? Pity. I don't feel very well. The time before, you thought, "I'll put this date, so that she'll come back"? You're an attractive woman. You wanted false papers. It was exciting. A woman like you coming here. A woman who wears perfume, who travels by plane, who goes to the theater, who pretends not to be afraid. When she is afraid. It's exciting. I'll change your card. But just for a second, I want you to see that I'm... I'm a person, I'm not just some guy. A person, in front of you, and that I'm looking at you. You have a little blemish on your eye. It's cute. That's all. Great. Enough. A little blemish on my eye. At least you've registered me. I'm pleased. I know I can't aspire to a woman like you. I just wanted to see you. What does "a woman like me" mean? I'm not crazy, you know. The card is just for... certain things that are good for me. - I know what I'm doing. - I didn't ask. Come for your card a few days from now. Can I just say one thing? Why "Margot"? It doesn't suit you. Why not... "Azra"? Or, I don't know... "Dafina"? Dafina's nice, isn't it? Some men invite you to dinner. I invite you to be whoever you want. I'm sorry I'm late. I bought a lot of things. Here she is. The one who always keeps us waiting. Why are you here? We came to see our granddaughter and to meet Christine. You seem surprised. - How about saying hello? - Sorry. Hello, Ninon. Hello, Mom. How are you? Didn't Abdel tell you? Isn't it why you're here? It is, yes. He said to come, as you were coming. - Yes. - You don't seem very pleased. You're making us all uncomfortable. As usual. - When did you arrive? - I... I just got here. How are you? Was the journey tiring? No, it didn't take long. We'll put off being tired for now. It's only right that we should come, for once. Although... seeing this house again is... always rather difficult. Why didn't you warn me? - Was it you? Did you call them? - Yes. How long is it since you two saw each other? - It... - How long? I... I don't know, it's a few... A few months. Roughly, I don't know. - Less. - We bumped into each other. It's less than that. We saw each other several times. Really? You didn't say. I called her to tell her I'd met Christine. We talked a little. Even after a few months, Nin must be unrecognizable. - She changes so quickly. - She does, it's... unbelievable. I'll help you. - I'll take it. - I bought some cakes. Shall I put them here? - Yes. - OK. Do you have another tray? A slightly bigger one? You're not familiar with the cupboards yet. - No. - You're right not to be. Let the men figure out where things are. You know, this isn't necessarily easy for us, but we're really pleased to get to know you, to meet you, Christine. And that Abdel isn't alone. Thank you. You want a cake, don't you, Ninouche? Are you afraid? I'm not a stranger. There's no need to be afraid. Come here, Ninon. Come along, sweetheart. Let me do it. So, are you in town for a few days or just for the night? - Weren't you in Poland or something? - I think she's tired. No, it's still early. Come here. Isn't it her bedtime? She can stay up a while. Stop being so bossy. It's not as if you're her mother! I'd like to see my granddaughter. Why do you have to interfere? Well, Abdel, I think... everyone's a little tired. Yes. Yes. Come here. We've put you in the bedroom. - Everything's prepared. - Will you be all right? We'll sleep on the couch. - Are you sure? - Sure. Mommy. Come here. - Mommy. - Don't say that. - Mommy! - This child is totally confused! - Mommy! - I can't stand to hear that. - Mommy! - Stop that! I can't stand it! I can't stand it! - I can't stand it! - Jude. I have to go to work. - Darling. - I'll be back, sweetheart. - Judith, wait. - Dad, I start early tomorrow. I must go. Francis, do something. - Make her be quiet. - Mommy! You're through to Abdel Soriano. Please leave a message. Good evening, Officer. - Your documents, please. - I didn't notice the speed. The vehicle documents and your ID, please. Officer, I don't... I forgot my bag, Officer, I don't... I don't have my documents. I had a fight with my husband and walked out. Do you have any document with your name on it? No, Officer. I can see a card there. That's just... It's a library card. That will do. Margot Soriano. Is the vehicle in your name? One moment. This person, Margot Soriano, died almost three years ago. Will you step out of your vehicle. Step out of your vehicle. It's all OK. Fine me, if you want. I'm not talking about a fine, Ma'am. My question is simple. Are you able, yes or no, to produce valid ID within 48 hours? Additionally, why did you present the officer with a card in another name? That's all I'm asking you. Is it the first time you've done this? Used false papers? The officer took the card. Have you done this before? Do you have any others? Listen, I'm not going to detain you. I'm not going to jail you for a speeding offense and a library card. But you must see a psychologist. It isn't normal to give the identity of someone who died three years ago when asked for your name. Do you understand? Who shall I call to come and fetch you? No one. I'll make my own way. Don't call anyone, please. Ma'am, stop shaking like that. You must understand that you appear to be unstable. I can't just let you leave. You can't drive in this state. Nobody touch me! Nobody! Let go of me! I said, let go of me! I mistook the card. I'm sorry, we looked alike. We were close in age. You were seven years older than your sister, Ma'am. Seven years. I had a rough evening, but I don't have problems. I have a house, a job and... I just want to go home. Do you live here? Yes. I mean, no, I live in France. Do you live here or in France? It's not the same. When you say you want to go home, do you mean to France, now, this evening? No, I'll stay in a hotel. So, you're not at home here. What's your first name, Ma'am? It's a simple question. Judith. Judith Fauvet. I was born on January 12th 1977 and I've been married to Melvil Fauvet since July 24th. 2006. And I'd like to go home, please. Could you give me that information one more time? - Your name? - Judith Fauvet. I was born on January 12th 1977 and I've been married to Melvil Fauvet... since July 24th... 2006. Judith? Judith? I'm sorry, I... I didn't dare move in case I woke her and I dozed off. Did she cry a lot? She doesn't like you to go away. She's better now. In the end she fell asleep. Did you do everything? No. I forgot what I wanted to do as soon as I went outside. I was here, I didn't leave the street. Are you wearing her perfume? - Sorry. - It's OK. I was tidying in the bathroom and... I don't know, the fragrance made me... - Nin must have found it comforting. - Yes. I haven't finished all the boxes. I took two to the Salvation Army, but there are more. Plus the sunglasses. You need to decide. I can stay a few days. I'll talk to Melvil. No. It's not your job, I'll do it. You can't keep traveling to and from France. I don't mind. We get along, don't we? Your presence is good for me. For a while, I forget. I'm at a loss with the little one. With you, it's... It's easier. And we're closer now. - Yes. - After all this time. I... I was wondering. My employer has an office here. I came for a symposium, do you remember? Yes. I've been thinking, why not? For a while. I could ask them. Yes. Abdel, no. The whole thing's absurd. All for speeding. It's ridiculous. I'm sorry I disturbed you. - Did the police say anything? - No. - Did you tell mom? - No, don't worry. I made something up. I didn't want to alarm her. Especially for something so trivial. I was a little tired last night, but now... I feel better. I have to go to Frankfurt tomorrow. I'd like to say sorry to Abdel and give Nin a kiss. - It was confusing for her. - You don't need to. You're going home, now. I booked tickets for 9 a.m. I said we'd take you to the station. Your mother's in the car. I'm sorry? Do you know your husband got the job? He must have told you. Yes, of course. I said I'd put you on the train, to reassure him. - You spoke to him? - Judith. He sent you a text with the biggest news of his life and you didn't call all night. He called everyone, in a state of total panic. I told him you'd felt faint. He didn't seem to know you were here with us. When you left, Ninon was asking for you to put her to bed. She said you read her stories every night. She cried her eyes out. She was asking for you. She was saying mommy all the time. There. I wanted you to know. Your mother couldn't stand it. She couldn't stand to hear that. Listen. Whatever is going on is not my business, but... You did what was necessary at the time, when Margot... No one has done as much as you for Abdel and the little one. No one. But you've done enough, now. It needs to stop. Leave the two of them alone. But I... I visited once or twice a year. - I didn't... - Jude, do you understand? I saw you had the key to Abdel's house and that your things were there. So, go home. Go to your husband. Be happy. This is a wonderful time for him. But I... I didn't kiss Nin before I left. I can't leave her. Jude... Jude... We won't be at the party. We go back tomorrow. Give him a kiss from us. And our congratulations. It's wonderful to lead an orchestra of this size. Yes, it's... Today is really... We're going to tour internationally, travel the world, make records no one will buy. - But we're happy. - Extremely happy. Thank you, everyone. I'm really... To be honest, I can hardly stand. It's marvelous. Really. Not that you can't stand. I'm so happy for you. Congratulations. Thank you. I wanted to make clear that... I saw Melvil's performance in Lyon and he was magnificent. Sorry, I... I'll be right back. You act well, don't you? - What? - Like I said, you act well. You seem really pleased for dad. I am pleased, what are you talking about? You've never been to Poland. Trust me, you say. But you deceive me. You've never been to Germany. Or Italy or anywhere. It's all bullshit. - I... I feel dizzy. - Stop it! You're pretending! What's going on? Jo, what's going on? Take this. Judith. What's going on? What happened? It's low blood pressure. Will you get my medicine... In my bag? What medicine? What is this low blood pressure? - I love you so much, you know. - What? What did you say? I'm crazy. It frightens me. Don't say that. - I should be locked away. - Stop it, will you? Take a deep breath. I'm here. It's OK. I wish I were like you. A rock. I love you so much, you know. I love you so much. Are you here? I'm leaving. I... I... I can't stay, I'm leaving. I'm leaving. Stay with me, please. I need you. I've met someone. These things happen. I'm happy. Judith, calm down, please. What was this attack? - Why didn't you say? - Don't say you haven't noticed. No. I'm happy. It's all I think about. My heart's bursting. Don't say you haven't noticed. I couldn't be happier. And you're telling me to stay. Shanghai, New York, you say blithely. I'm your fucking wife! I... I invent hotels, airports for you. I describe symposia, I leave, return. I say you can't come there. That you can't call my colleagues. That you can't come along. You say you didn't notice. Cut it out. I thought that at some point you'd come back. I didn't understand. I don't understand why you didn't come back. Come back to what? What I'm experiencing is... There's no way you could know. It's immense. It's... Is it because of the child? Don't touch me! I don't want anyone to touch me. Nobody touch me. Anymore. Yes. Hi, Judith, it's Philip, Philip Collins. Please don't come in on Monday. Your recent behaviour is totally incompatible with the level of commitment we require here at Collins and Associates. You'll be receiving the rest of your salary at the end of the month, as usual. I am really sorry that it has to end this way, but you really leave me no choice. Goodbye. Yes. Hi, Judith, it's Philip, Philip Collins. I can take her to school if you like. What are you doing? Judith, please. Stop it. Stop! Now. I told her I'd be with her. I'm with her all the time. - I don't want to hurt you. - Then don't. You should see someone. You should seek help. Let me clear up. You're driving me crazy! Do you understand? I'm driving you crazy? I'm driving you crazy? Yes! How can you do this to me? How can you do this? It was you who cut us off from the world. You! I was here to help you. You used me. You asked me to stay. "Tell Melvil you're working more, that you have to go to Germany, Spain!" I made things up! You used me. That's all! Don't say anything. Don't say anything! Do you realize? You're deluding yourself. You scare me. Jude, you lie all the time, to everyone. But I love you. I love you. I love you! What am I going to do? I love both of you. Jude, I lost my wife. Right? The woman I loved. Do you understand? I know what I said. What I did. I'm trying to move on. What happened between us... I was lost. I needed help. It's nothing. It means nothing. It's... No, Jude. - Leave me alone! - I'm sorry. Ninon, go back upstairs. Jude, I'm sorry. What happened meant a lot to me. - I didn't mean what I said. - Leave me alone. Jude, but... I feel bad. - Leave me alone. - I knew you were lying to Melvil. I know it's my fault. - I'm sorry. - But... Let go of me! Leave me alone! Calm down. - No, calm down. - Help me, she's crying. She's crying, leave me alone! Nin, get out of here! You're out of your mind! Leave me alone! You're sick! - It's nothing, sit on the couch. - Nin! - Leave me alone, she hurt herself! - Calm down! - She hurt herself! - Jude. - I'll call for help. - Leave me alone. Nin! No, leave me alone! Open the door! Open the door! Leave me alone! - Emergency services. - There's someone having a breakdown... Where is the person? Ninon. Sweetheart. Stop! I'm sorry! Fuck, what's he doing? Get out of the way! Move! It'll be all right, sweetheart. It'll be all right. It'll be all right. I need a name, Ma'am. Do you have any ID? I'll pay in cash. I need some ID, Ma'am. I'll pay double. - Room 234. - Thanks. Ninon, will you wait one second? Let's not wet your hair. - I don't want to. - No, Nin. Lie down, please, sweetheart. It's late. Nin, did you hear? That's enough. No, Nin. Shall I read the blue doe? No. Go to sleep, sweetheart. That's enough. Yes, Collins with two "L's". Madeleine. Sorry, can I call you back later? Sweetheart? Put your hood up, like I told you. My mommy will always be with me. - I like it when you smile. - Where are we going? We'll be together. Don't worry. My mommy and I will be together all our lives. My mommy will always be with me. - She'll always be with me. - What's the matter, Nin? My mommy will always be with me. We'll be together all our lives. You're my mommy! - We'll be together all our lives. - Nin, calm down! You're my mommy. Nin, please, keep... No. Keep still, it's dangerous. You're my mommy. You're my mommy! My mommy will always be with me. What is it, angel? Come on, let's go for a little walk. - I want my mommy! - Sweetheart, calm down. - Be quiet, angel. - Let go of me! - Be quiet, look. - No! - Let go of me! - What's the matter? - I want my mommy! - Why are you saying that? Let go of me! Shall we go see the animals? Yes, let's go see the animals. Don't you want to? Let's go see the animals. Come along. Don't you want to see the blue doe? - Come along. - No. Let go of me! I want to go! What's the matter? Come along, Ninon. I'm here. What's the matter? What's the matter! You're not my mommy! You're not my mommy! - You're not my mommy. - I am your mommy! You're not my mommy! Go away! You're not my mommy! I want my mommy! I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. Your mommy isn't here anymore. She had an accident when you were little. She fainted and hit her head. Forgive me. It's over now. Come along. Yes. I'm close by. Darling, I wanted to say... I... You're not coming back? No. I've turned into a monster. I'm not afraid. I'll think of you and your brother every day. One day, I'll come back. We'll be together. I don't know when. I love you so much, darling. Give your brother a kiss. Tell him I love him. Are you all right? You're sick. You're out of your mind! She's fine. You're a public menace. I was so afraid. She knew all along. She knows everything. Let me go. Please. So, you're alone at last? Yes. And your daughter? Are you all right? Yes. Are you sure? No. Here. With two "L's". It's still not my favorite name, but... Shall I take you somewhere? Not in this life, no. Thanks. Revised and Synchroniozed by FAST TITLES MEDIA
