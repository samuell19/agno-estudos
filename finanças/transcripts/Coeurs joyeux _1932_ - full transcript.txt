Happy Hearts "Silly! I forgave you ages ago." Goodnight! See you soon! How about going to Luna Park? Hey, young man! Could you spare a light? You should buy something like this - matches. Shut up! You're nuts, I haven't said a thing! Excuse me, gentlemen, could I ask a question? What's this all about? I don't much care, I'm good for the night. Fernand, have you seen Charlie? I don't know. He was here a minute ago. Who's there? Good evening, sir. You're not hungry? I wouldn't mind a little snack. Because I want to explain to you: I was supposed to go with my pal to Luna Park for some fun with the girls. Get it? No. Another time, then. You'll project a film for us. - Oh really? - You'll be well paid. Well paid? Well, if you put it like that. Project a film, just like that, in the middle of the night. What's this all about? This is almost brand new. This won't work. Oh, I get it! The film won't play! I'll put it back but it won't work. And this doesn't work either. - The element's burned out. - That's what I said. - That would have taken a long time. - Well, it takes an expert. What a mess! What have you done here? I need a screwdriver What size do you need? Seven or eight. Let's see. Of course it doesn't work, setting up a film like that. It's criminal! I don't like that word! Now it'll go. Lights off. Look: the guy in the middle with the pointed beard... ... that's him. He has a limp! Can't hide a thing from you. Diamond Exchange Amsterdam And the others - are those his sons? Idiot - his secretaries. His sons? What a moron! Shut up! - He's got rheumatism, too. - Will you shut up? Take a good look at the shape of his beard. - It's very important. - Yes, yes, don't worry. Oh, the gentleman doesn't like to be photographed! And this is the only photo of him we have. So, have you got it? Certainly. He has a sharp pointy beard. Yes, it's so pointy it's standing straight up. And his walk. What kind of walk is that? Arthritic. - Shut up! - I know. The right leg, stupid! What about my right leg? Not bad. What about the beard? What will you do? If I could see it again. Start it over. Go on, play it again. Excuse me, gentlemen, what sort of plot are you hatching? Play it again! I didn't mean anything by it. I'm not making trouble. Terrific! Here. Five hundred smackers. Now get lost. But him, and the guy who-- what's it for? If you ever mention what you've seen here-- Hey, it's all the same to me. Goodnight. 'Night. Goodnight. - Say, have you got a gun? - Naturally. - Give it to me. - Are you nuts? No, there's something fishy going on in there. Well, OK. Who's there? Come on my dear friend! There's a good boy, no need to be scared, Curly! I'm going to give you a darn close haircut! Go on. Go on, arrest them! This little guy wanted to turn us in. Alright, we'll keep him here. First, give me back the 500 clams. I don't have them anymore. I lost them. Well, what do you know? He lost them! You lost them! Amateur. Lock him up! Come along, pretty boy. Time for your treatment! Oh, monsieur likes it rough! Well, here you go, my lad! What a little jackass! That's for sure! You're not ready yet. The hair, the glasses, hurry! Oh yes, I'd completely forgotten. I don't know where my head is today. - We could have a bit to eat. - Yes, it's about time. When do we have to leave? In 10 or 15 minutes. Lucette? So, who's going to do the driving? - Why not Theo? - Fine. Lucette! Listen. We leave in 12 minutes. The job shouldn't take more than 15 minutes. We come straight back. - Understand? - Yes. You, keep the engine running. Wait for us at the corner. You called me, Olivier? - Do you need something? - Bring us something to eat. What was I saying? Oh yes... You be at the corner, opposite the news stand. Shut up! Sure, if it makes you happy. I don't want to be annoying. Yes, but do you think I can pull it off? You could pass for a professional. You look really chic; like a real hotel waiter. But look, the sleeves aren't-- Oh, stuff it! You can take the plate away. Two coffees right away, sir! Don't drop your stuff. You make a great waiter! What a clod! That's your dear sister. You didn't give her another-- I mean... because... How's this? Perfect! - Very good! - Not bad. It's time. Let's go. Yes, our little jackass. - Who's going to guard him? - I have to drive. - You then. - Me? Impossible! Who'll play the nice guy at the hotel? That's true. Open up! Open up! You've got a bloody nerve! You can't lock me up in here! Will you open this door, you bunch of bastards? You've no right! Open this door! Animals! And I'm hungry! I want a steak, with fries, and a bit of red wine. And some sauerkraut, and half a pint. A joke's a joke, but-- And now for the end game. Nothing can stop me now! - What's up? - I'm guarding you. Oh, that makes me feel better. Well, I'm off to supper. Goodnight. Please, I beg you. If you leave, they'll kill me. Please take the bullets out. I'll get you something to eat. - It's empty now. - Put it down. - Ham? - No, some sausage. - Did you have a good trip? - Excellent, Mr. van Hoolst. Please sit down. - You have the inventory? - Yes, indeed. Here it is. First we have the diamond rivière, 500 stones, 228 carats Two hundred and twenty-what? Two hundred and twenty-eight. Two hundred and twenty-eight. An emerald. An emerald... ... surrounded by diamonds, set in platinum, 40 stones. Mr. van Hoolst? You're wanted on the telephone; it's Amsterdam. Urgent. I have no time; don't disturb me. This ring is magnificent! - Amsterdam, you say? - Yes, sir. Not a moment's peace! Excuse me for a moment. Where is it? Straight down this corridor, first door on the right and then left. It wasn't that important after all, that Amsterdam call. I wish they'd stop bothering me. A really magnificent ring! - Continue. - A bracelet, emeralds and diamonds. Emerald and diamond bracelet. What? But that's impossible! Ask your colleagues! Just a moment, sir. - Did you have a call from Amsterdam? - No. May I have your name? Van Hoolst! My room number? Just a moment. What is my room number? Fifty-one, I think. The waiter came over and told me I had an urgent call from Amsterdam! Here is the key. Everything is in order Mr.... Bon voyage! Thank you, the same to you. Are you going abroad, Mr. van Hoolst? Why of course! It's only overseas I can sell them profitably. There's nothing to be done here. Leave me alone! You there! Yes, sir? - Are you the manager? - I am, sir. I demand all the hotel waiters come here at once. That's impossible, sir. - A taxi, sir? - No thanks, we have our own car. Yes, and it goes like the wind, too! - All the same sir... - That does not interest me at all! The big dark-haired guy? He's your brother? Would you like a cigarette? Why don't we both run off? No. He'll come after me. Come on. Sit there. Where's the gun? Point it at me. You have to aim here. She's really a top-notch kid! He wanted a bit of air? Yes... He... that is... I get why you put her in charge! She could have killed me; didn't put the gun down once. Lucette is the best! Of course! She's my kid sister! For you. I decorate you for your act of valor. And now, lock him up. - Where should I put him? - I don't care. - In the cellar, if you like. - OK, you, let's go! Quick! And I mean today, not tomorrow. - Do you need some help? - No, but let's go quietly. Get away? Don't make me laugh! What do you think? I'd give you a kiss? Then I said, 'Jewels of this quality have to be sold overseas.' It was a struggle to keep a straight face. What a moron! And if you try one more time to escape, you'll have to deal with me. No kidding. Here! Inside. And no tricks! Double-locked. With you, it's safer. Here's to our old friend van Hoolst! - All done. - Good! Time to head to bed; we leave at 7:00 AM. Who's going to drive? Doesn't matter; in 3 hours we'll be on our way. We'll have to floor it, then. Yes, and get our heads smashed in! Goodnight. Tomorrow at noon we'll be in the middle of the ocean. And then... we strike it rich! One day, marching along the road Two handsome soldiers met Always being broke isn't worth a damn. If you don't have a big plan up your sleeve And if you do, well then, your case Is great and you're on your way to making dough No more thinking about tomorrow; Everything is going great! What's that? 1-2-3-4; My happiness is with you No need to look any further 1-2-3-4; If you love me, stay with me No need to look any further It all adds up; we're a perfect pair If we 2 remain together, we'll be happy Your heart with mine is the secret of happiness We'll never find anything better. 1-2-3-4; My happiness is with you No need to look any further 1-2-3-4; If you love me, stay with me No need to look any further It all adds up; we're a perfect pair If we 2 remain together, we'll be happy Your heart with mine is the secret of happiness We'll never find anything better. Well, what you do you expect? When you don't make much money— Can't do any better. It's lovely! It's really nice. Well, one can get used to anything. - How nice! - It's my mascot. Blow on him 3 times, and he wags his tail. And he brings good luck. Has he brought you good luck before? No. Well, goodnight. Sleep well. Good evening. Where are you going? Next door, to the living room. Goodnight. Goodbye Cucu! Quietly! So then, you've shown up. What are you doing here? Well... I can't sleep in my room. It's haunted. Yes, yes, and I'm scared! You heard that? Stop kidding around. Better check it out. Unless you'd prefer to? See? The boogeyman. My name is Jules. Jules the piano player. I play... that is, not far from here... I play at the Victoria Palace cinema. You see? What's wrong? I can't get to sleep. It's too bright out. And I can't close the curtains. The curtains? Well, why not? It's broken. Yes, it is. Look - this is how it should go. You have to forget all that now. Yes. Good morning! Two rolls, as usual? No, 4! - Good morning. - Good morning, Madame! What's that? Where? Listen, I can make you a new pair of pants out of this. It's top quality, strong as leather. And how much would that cost? Right where I want you! Figured I'd fall for it again? Let me go! And where did you learn that whistle? But Inspector, I already told you... ... I don't know those men. What were you looking for at the house? I wanted... Come on, what did you want? I'm telling you, I'm a movie theater projectionist. I've nothing to do with those guys. Let me show you my papers. Send someone to my house. You'll see. Yes, yes. And where do you live? Gustav-Marie, number 31. - Yes? - Hello. Did you sleep well? Is he still asleep? Where is he? Where's Charles? His name's Charles? Naturally. What do you think his name is? I have another friend who's name's Paul... ... but he doesn't look at all like him. He has a sort of... So where is Charles? He's gone, I don't know. Don't worry, he'll be back. I have an idea; come over to my place. We'll have some music. While we wait, I'll play the piano for you - happy, sad, whatever you like. It'll pass the time. Come on. What if he comes back in the meantime? He's smart, he'll come looking for us. - Come over to my place. - You're sure? A search? Don't make a fuss; show us the way. What should we play? Sad, happy? Let's do happy. Don't look like so sad - smile! I like this song; I play it at the cinema during love scenes. You like it? There! I like you. The words are good too, but I've forgotten them. I can never remember. According to the description, it's one of the stolen jewels. What's going on over there? Excuse me. I forgot - sign the form. When will Mr. Charles be coming back? It's too soon to say. You think he'll be gone long? You'll have to wait for the results of the investigation. Who would have thought this could happen in a house like ours? I never would have believed it of Mr. Charles. Some friends. They said Charles would come back. He went out to buy something. Shall we have a little more music? Something cheerful? Yes. There's no way. It's not possible. What? What's not possible? To go to the police station. - Why not? - Because of my brother. Who's he? They found the ring, they arrested Charles. There must be some way of setting him free. That's great, but how? "300,000 francs reward Daring jewel theft at the Grand Hotel" Perhaps if we went to that man who was robbed. I don't care about that! What? A ring? What ring? We found it during a search. It's a large emerald— Surrounded by diamonds? Yes, it's possible. But you only have to see yourself— I told you this morning, I don't know anything more. What? Come down at once? I don't have time! No, no, I already told you that's impossible. Where did you say? Police headquarters, Mr. Paget's office. Alright, I'll come. But I don't have much time. Who are you? What do you want? Mr. van Hoolst? Yes, and I have no time! Didn't you hear? Mr. van Hoolst, listen for a moment. We have to go at once. It's in your interest. It's about your jewels. The men who stole them - I want to help you. I'll help you get them back. Get back my jewels? You? Yes, me. Incredible! All the police in the world are on the job... ... and you claim-- But I know where they are! What do you want? My name is Jules. I'm a pianist. I play at the Victoria. Not far from here, just 5 minutes— What do you want? Yes, that's nothing to do with it. I want to talk to my friend Charlie. He was arrested this morning. Visiting hours are from 3 to 4. - Couldn't you just once— - From 3 to 4! Are you carrying any securities or foreign currency? Are you carrying any securities or foreign currency? No, just some clothes and personal items. We're taking a little holiday What do you have in there? Toiletries. What they call “necessary items”. Open it. With pleasure. The police mustn't find out. Because her brother is in on it. He's the head of the gang. There are 5 of them. They're sailing for America today on the Albert Balin. - It's OK. - It's not OK! She's all alone. And there's no one to get the jewels back. So you're going to stay locked up here till the cows come home? The police mustn't find out! I already told you sir, I have nothing here to match your inquiry. Perhaps the gentlemen booked first class cabins. There are 5 available. - Didn't you tell me that before? - Yes, that's what I thought. Yes, I think I've found the people you're looking for. Cabins 27, 28, 29, 30 and 31. We will be leaving in 2 hours, sir. Let's settle in a bit, and in half an hour, we'll meet at the bar. Shut up! What's going on? What are you doing here? What do you want? Where are the jewels? I don't know. What's it got to do with you? I want to know where the jewels are! I'll count to three. If you haven't told me where the jewels are by 3... One... Two... And— Thanks. - No, that's mine. - Oh, take it then! What do you want with the jewels, my little Lucette? - What's going on? - Hey, it's Lucette! Hello, little Lucette, how are things? The young lady is not polite. Excuse me, did you fire a gun? - Here? - Yes, I heard it. Oh yes, earlier, when the suitcase fell over. - Excuse me. - Not at all. So, you want the jewels. May we know what you want with them? I... because... Because I've had enough! Enough of you bossing me around! I want the jewels because I need them. Another man's been arrested, and he's innocent. You're the one who stole them, not him. And if you don't give them to me at once you're done for. I'll go straight to the police. I need the jewels, if I take them back, they'll let Charles go. The little mechanic? They arrested him? Yes. That's great! He's the one who— How did you get here? In Mr. van Hoolst's car. He's waiting for me nearby. So I can take his jewels back to him. Listen, Lucette; be sensible. We have no secrets between us. You can trust me. We're brother and sister, after all. Tell me the truth. You love this fellow, don't you? Why didn't you tell me from the start? Alright, Theo, get the jewels. - But Olivier! - Isn't that going a bit too far? Get the jewels! Hurry. And be careful. Don't worry a bit. Nothing else to do; when a woman loses her heart... It's love! True love! I can bear no more. My heart is breaking! - Push it further back. - No way, it's wedged in. - You're sure it won't move around? - Not a chance. You never know, something could go wrong. I hope you've put a block behind the wheels. Of course we have! This isn't the first car we've shipped. I'll just put on the hand brake. Two precautions are better than one. What do you make of this, Ernest? That young lady has kept me waiting for hours. If you'll permit me, I don't believe she'll ever come back. Why did you bring me here then? You wished to come; it's not my place to argue. VAN HOOLST AFFAIR STOP PREVENT DEPARTURE ALBERT BALIN STOP ARREST— Goodbye, Olivier. Thank you so much. Goodbye, Theo. Good luck, Philippe. Bravo! You're a wonderful girl! Come quick! I'll phone the police station and tell them everything is fine. Wait here. I'll be right back. - Please hurry! - Don't worry. Stop! What's the meaning of this? Let me go! What's in here? For heaven's sake, let me go! I've told you, I'm the jeweler van Hoolst! We'll see about that! Have you any ID? Of course! Here's my passport. My chauffeur is here, he can tell you who I am. Ernest! Come here! I'll lodge a complaint! The chief of police is a friend of mine.
