Like in the story I'm about to tell you, the story of Massa Yo. Massa Yo who became a black boss. - Hello, beautiful. - Hello, Boss. - How's your health? - You're a doctor now? Such foul humour to your most faithful client? Your manners annoy me. You want Bastos? Minty? Gold Tobacco? Tell me exactly what you want. It's not nice of you to forget what I like. Put the money down, take what you want and go. You... Really! Here's the money. Darling, matches, quick! Stop pissing me off! Here they are. You're in a real bad mood today, my darling! I spoil you all the time with beer. These presents prove I love you. I'm a big planter. I'm rich and I adore you. You love me? You love me? I am rich and I carry a lot of money. Oh, thank you, Boss! Boss, I came to collect the rest of my wages for last month. - What? - The rest of last month's pay. Gaspar! You think I print money? Here's 1500. That's what you deserve this month. This month I didn't ask for any in advance. I want my 3000. Gaspar, it's amazing! You're only entitled to 1000 anyway. What about my half beer the other day? And the doughnuts I buy every morning? Your woman gave birth at the clinic, I bought you a thermo for 1800! Isn't that money? It was a present for my wife! I gave your wife a present. Is your wife my wife? Be careful, or I'll fire you! There's no shortage of workers in the city of Douala. The children here think I print money. Every day with the money! He'll squander this money in bars and brothels, Huh? They don't multiply their money. If your kid weren't ill, I wouldn't even give you 1000. - Hello, darling. - Big Boss, you're here. - Sit down. - Thank you. - I kept your favourite dish for you. - You're wonderful. - Isn't there a spoon? - Eat it like that, Boss. - With my hand? - It's couscous, have it like that. - Couscous with gombo sauce. - Yes. No beer? It's OK like that. Plenty is not little. Here's your money. Thank you. Come behind the counter and show me. Alright. There it is. Well, it's too big. Too big! But my money isn't too big. Give me the blue ones with filter tips. Put the money down, take them and go! - I want the gold ones. - Put the money down, take them and go! Put the money down, take them and go! Big boss, hello! Gaspar, how goes it? I came for my little thing. I came for my little thing. Your credit? You and money, honestly! What do you do with it? I go to the office, to the bathroom, you ask for money. Wherever you find me, money! You are my friend. Take my money. But pay it back with 25% interest, understand? It's you, Joseph Koki, or should I say Massa Yo? Yes. It's me, Mr. Joseph Koki, or Massa Yo, businessman and planter at Manjo. And this is one of my many hardware stores throughout the republic. And who are you? Police inspector Ngassanou, from the anti-crime brigade. Now you know. Carry on with your confession. Mr. Inspector, I was caught red-handed breaking and entering a container at the Douala Harbour. I did not act by myself. As usual, we were four and it was like this: while Jacob Toli and I, plus my two other accomplices Alexandre Bombai and Jean-Marie Felefele, now at large, while we broke into the containers, our chief Massa Yo waited in his truck where we'd load the stolen goods to be delivered at his numerous shops. The leader of our gang is Mister Joseph Koki, or Massa Yo. Here he is. - Bastard, are you crazy? - Be quiet, I ask of you! It's him. I only know him through what he did in my house, I didn't know he was a smuggler in Douala Port! I recommend that you stay calm. We have evidence proving what he says is true. - It's not true! - Be quiet! Calm down. Mister Toli, you think my shop isn't an honest business? - Inspector, it's only a front. - Bastard! Rascal! You're a liar and a thief! Inspector, I myself will explain it to you. Inspector, I'm going to prove that he is a liar. I have an invoice for every item in my hardware shops! All invoices are kept in a box here. Show us where, we will fetch them ourselves. They're under the cash register, inside a cardboard box. Is this the box in question? All invoices are there, you can check them. It seems you're making fun of us, Massa Yo. Are you sure this is the box in question? Yes, all invoices are in there. It's incredible. It's a flagrant! Look at it yourself, Sir. Bills for the merchandise stolen last week from the container at Douala Harbour! No invoice justifying any stock, for Christ's sake! It's not possible. Jacob Toli, it's a frame-up! This doesn't end here! I assure you, I've got connections. We can now say that Massa Yo is a successful man. But at what cost? This doesn't end here! I assure you, I've got connections. I know your chief, and your chief's chief! It's me. I conspired with his employee. I'm the oldest son of the family. I ran away from home when I was 14, when I understood who that man was, who people said was my father. I also swapped the invoices for the bills. I am, however, his daughter. I only feel hatred for him. He robbed me of my pride and dignity. Due to his commitments and his treasons, in exchange for money and honours. Now I wait impatiently for his death so that I can squander his fortune! Marabout, I came here because I want you to make this plot successful. I'll do anything in order to achieve it. I have reasons of my own to do this. Marabout! You must help me. This man has betrayed his close friends, abandoned my mother after using her, for money. I'm this man's wife. And I also am his chargé de missions. I'd send him to the field when we had to conquer a market, or ask for a favour. Today I'm pregnant and the father of my child is not my husband. Marabout! I came to see you because I want to avenge myself! I want my husband to become, well... I want you to stop him being a man. You can only get out of there if you know God personally. If you add another word, you'll answer for attempted bribery of police officers in the course of their duties. All your assets will be impounded and sold in a public auction. Out of here, if you... Bring me that. That'll teach you to pay your employees well! Now I'm going to tell you another story. Once upon a time there was a man in an African village called Gaspar. He dreamt about having lots of money and for that purpose he toiled away, day and night, without rest. His young wife, Cecilia, was beautiful and sturdy, fleshy right where it was needed. And as is usual in this region, Cecilia was faithful but very demanding. Pay attention! Don't get me wet. What're you looking at, Cecilia? Sweep the outside, but don't throw sand at me. What exactly do you want? You follow me everywhere! What're you up to with your little schemes? I already told you to sweep the outside. Get out, I say! Leave me alone. Who told you could touch me? If you insist you're going to get it! I told you, you'll get it! Cecilia, I told you you get it! Cecilia, if you don't stop, I'll hit you! Hit me? Is that all you can do? You're only strong enough to hit me! Just try touching me and I'll show you're not a man. How impertinent! How dare you address your husband like that? I provide for you, don't I, Cecilia? Husband! Husband! My husband! You're only my husband when it comes to hitting me! Did you hit me? Me?! You've hit me?! Just you wait. Like this, you're going to kill me today! Like this, you're going to kill me today! You're going to kill me. Leave my loincloth alone, are you trying to embarrass me? You'll kill me! - Get to the point, Gaspar! - Great Boss! You're going to settle in town with your Danse? I cannot leave Cecilia behind in the village! If you pay me I'll take her with me to Douala. Be careful, women don't behave in town as They do at the village. Can't you see the way my wife looks at me? She knows what they do. If you only knew... If you give me the money I know where to invest it. I'm not naive. Gaspar, I can lend you the money for 40% interest. 40%. But Boss, I thought we were friends. Yesterday you said 25%. How come now it's 40%? Heavens! What? You think you're my friend just because I've got money? Well, all right, I'll take it. - 40% in six months. - Trust me. Darling, we're going to the movies. You know I'm ill, I can't go to the movies. There's a film tonight called "The Price of Freedom". It's been on for a long time and I want to watch it badly. You can go by yourself. It doesn't matter. So long, then. - Don't forget your key. - All right. - And above all, don't come back late. - All right. Who is it? - Your husband is out of town? - Yes, come. - What is it? - Open up. It's me, Antoine. You didn't go out of town after all? Open up! I know there's a man in there, and this one I won't miss. Wait! - Open it, or I'll break it down! - Let me get dressed! Open it, or I'll break it down! It's five to midnight. The weather report: clear skies today, but hotter and heavier... Marthe! I'm going to kill you today! I caught you with another man! - Darling, you're not in bed? - I was waiting for you. Are you coming back from the movies? It's two in the morning. It was a double feature. Dikongué Pipa is not easy. "The Price of Freedom" and "Muna Moto". - Do you want to eat? - I can't eat any more. - Let's go to bed, then. - Go on. - What're you waiting for? - Well, I must pee. Well, piss then. Piss! Now I'm going to bed. But what is that? What is it? What panties have you put on? Is that your double feature? Jacobine! Good morning. Your fiancé Gaspar is here. Jacobine! Good morning. Your fiancé Gaspar is here. You must welcome him correctly. Your father has already accepted the marriage portion. - I don't love him! - It's your obligation. Get up, get up! Go and welcome him. Welcome, my son. You did well by coming here. Mama, the trip: Brickyard, New York, Paris, it's too tiring. Really! - You'll sleep here. - If you say so. But it's my room. Don't touch anything. I've already given the money, you're practically my wife. We'll sleep here. - I'm not sleeping with you. - We'll sleep here. - You'll sleep here with me. - I won't. - You will sleep here with me. - I won't! Leave me alone! Eat! - You start. - Serve yourself, I'm starving. I cannot eat much. At our house in Paris we're not used to eating a lot. For instance, in London we only eat a spoonful a day. - Is that all? - That's all. I must serve you like I will at our house. Here you're all used to eating too much. At our house, if you eat too much, it won't do. - Where's the toilet? - Here it is. - Come inside with me. - No! You, really... Are you coming with me, girl? You'll see. My God! Who did this? They're strangers, my children are. They turned out different. I no longer understand them. They ate everything, they stole the lot! I don't know what to do! Come, children, come! Come and eat! Hurry up! Your lazy father isn't here, as usual. Come, take a seat. It's a reception in honour of my son-in-law. But where is my son-in-law? Jacobine, where's your husband? Call him. Go on, hurry up! My son-in-law, one must eat well. - I'll fill these plates for you. - We must serve well our... Serve me correctly, too. Here's my son-in-law's plate, pass it on to him. That's too much. In New York we never eat that much. Son-in-law, one must eat well. Darling, you eat it. At our house in Paris we're used to eating only a spoonful. I find it discouraging to see a meal like this one. - It's not discouraging, eat! - I'll eat as little as possible. In our country we usually don't see a meal like this one. Enjoy, darling. Eat like you do in your country. Wait a minute! It's news time, maybe I was already appointed! I've just arrived from a diplomatic mission overseas, Mokolo, Mozart, Bangangté, Paris, New York. Very well, my son-in-law. Such long diplo... diplo... - Diploma what? - Diplomatic. When are you going to come and fetch your wife? There're young men constantly knocking at our window because of this girl. I suffer too much on account of her. When're you going to come and fetch her? We're waiting. Right now, she should want to. It's just that I haven't yet finished my three-story villa. What? You need a village with three floors before getting married? My husband is over there, the weakling. He isn't even aware of how much I suffer here. I can't sleep at night. Any scoundrel can come and kidnap us. And he wouldn't even notice, the hoodlum. Sleeps all the time. Look at him there, half asleep. Is that a person? There he is, look at him. You call that a person? He's no person. He's there, but absent. And that's it. She's now yours. I caught him! I caught him! Put on the light! Thief! Thief! - It's not one of my children! - Thief! Thief! Thief! My son-in-law! It was you and I was blaming my children! You thief! My son-in-law a thief! - Is it you? - It's you, my son-in law. It was you, my son-in-law. Was it you? Was it you who stole? Yes, my son-in-law. Yes. Was it you? Yes, my son-in-law, was it you? I think my problem is solved. Irene, the Marabout awaits you. He gave me this to mix with my husband's food. One coffee spoon at the time. I'm ill, Cecilia, take me to hospital. I'm feeling rotten. I'm dying, take me to hospital. My God, what will happen to me? What have I done? Jacob! Jacob! Stop playing. Gaspar is dead! Your brother-in-law is dead. I've a lot to do: I must fetch the body at the morgue. Then I need to take it to the village. Got a lot of errands to do. Can you send a telegram? Yes, I'm a telegram specialist. You really know how to send a telegram? There's nothing to it, I send them regularly. Well, here's the telegram. You're going to send it to Massa Yo, his very close friend. Take one thousand francs for expenses. Can you really send a telegram ? Wires that go up... Wires that go down! I repeat, wires that go up and down! Mr. Gaspar, planter and businessman, is dead in town. Mrs. Gaspar requests your immediate presence. Signed, Mrs. Gaspar. It's me, Jacob, in person, who came to send this telegram to Massa Yo, who is in Douala. Saying that Gaspar died in town. And that he must come urgently. I say, Massa Yo must come here urgently. Here's the money, I leave it here. Send this news to Douala. These people are loaded with money, but they won't spend. Since we've been here each one has received only one beer. They're rich but they don't spend. I always drink a lot of beer at a wake. Two bottles, three bottles... One bottle of beer is just plain cheap. Cecilia, since I arrived I've cried, and cried, and screamed; but I didn't drink anything yet, is there really not a single beer? Could I possibly refuse you a beer? Go to my room, under the bed there's the brand you like most. - Did anybody see you? - No. They couldn't. Touch up my makeup a little. Up here. - Am I all right? - You are. I cannot give them reason to comment. I must look my best. - You're fine. - And up here? Fine, too? Fine. What is it? Shit! It's true that Gaspar is dead? He can't be! There's the wake! And what about my money? Heavens! Let me remind you of my promissory note for 5 million. It can't be. I thought it was a lie... but it's true. It's not possible. Gaspar, I'll lend you the money at 40% interest. All right, 40%. Is it true? Is it like you said? It can't be. Give me my money. No, Gaspar! Is it possible you are dead? No. It can't be real death, it can only be simulated death. Not possible! One million I accept, 2 million... I can say we're both Cameroonian, but 5 million I refuse to... Give me my money back! Gaspar, we were friends in this world, even when you ate my money, go ahead, I'll follow later. Gaspar, my friend! You abandon me thus? What about the hardware store? The plantation? PROVISIONAL END - Where's my little man? - Here, mother! Come here, quickly! I'm going to my meeting. I left Tonton Onguess' food in the kitchen. You'll take it to him and say I went to the meeting. - He'll understand. - Yes, mother. I came to visit with you. Not now, I'm in a hurry. I'm going to my meeting, will come back later. - All right, I'll wait. - Sure. What's this, where're you going? Mother sent me. I'm going to Mokolo. - To whose house? - Tonton Onguess. - Who and where is Onguess? - Where mother sends me a lot. - What're you carrying in there? - It's Tonton Onguess' food. - What? Who sent it? - Mother did. Bring it here. What? Oh, well. All right, get in. Let's go. This is for Tonton Onguess, whom I don't know. Now bring me my food, because I'm your father, the one who gives you money everyday. - What is it? - It's Marguerite. What is it, my dear? You don't answer? - Good evening, darling. - Get out of here. Don't bother me. What's the matter with you? Don't you see that they are my books? What's the matter? Don't bother me, I'm trying to work. What have I done to you? What do you take me for? Am I a goat that should eat your grass? I sent you fish. Here is your fish and get out of here. I don't understand. Like I said, I sent you a fish. Stop annoying me. Here's your fish, take it and get out of here! Get out of my house. I don't want to see you again. She's my cousin. She came for a visit. She came out of the blue. You know how Africans are. She got on my nerves, that's why I hit her. You took too long. I'm tired of waiting. Leave me be, my friend. At least wait until I sit down. What happened to you? Leave me alone. - You know Onguess? - Yes, I know him. - Well, Onguess did this to me. - The guy you feed everyday? Yes. You know what the problem is, then. I think the child made a mistake. He must have mistaken Onguess' food for my husband's ndolé, and took ndolé to Onguess, instead. That's why Onguess hit me. Listen, darling. She supports me. I am but a simple student. The boy! The one you feed everyday. He says he is no herb-eating goat. He wants fish. My husband has to endure ndolé everyday. For once in his life couldn't my friend have eaten ndolé? Well, Irene... This water I'm about to pour onto the plate... was given to me... by the great Marabout who prepared it specially for me. This water protects me... from every spell... bad luck... or poison. Everything. Absolutely everything. But in no way... can it be exposed directly to the rays of the sun. Otherwise, I die on the spot. So, there's my life's secret. From now on you have the power of life and death over me. It's a heavy responsibility, Richard, but I promise you I'll live up to it. In any case, should you still betray me I would no longer be here to warn you. Put it away somewhere. Anyway, I just came back from Berthe's house. Berthe? So what? "So what"! Sent there by Richard, your husband. She's his lover, my dear. Your friend Berthe. And that's not all. It seems he built her a beautiful house, furnished and all! What? And we're living here in rented quarters? Wait a minute. I don't understand. Where did Richard get all that money? I've just handed her 15 thousand francs your husband told me to give her. And now, I believe, Berthe's pregnancy is the work of your husband. They meet today at noon. Where're you going like that, Richard? What a question! I asked where you are going, dressed like that. As if I didn't have to work today! And need you make yourself so elegant, just to go to work? Aren't you going to answer? What do you want me to answer? I don't understand. But I understand perfectly. You're going to meet her, right? Meet her? Who? She! The one for whom you built and furnished a house. The one you sent 15 thousand francs. When is the baby due? When is the baby due? You exaggerate, Irene. Let me go to work. You're going nowhere! And you hit me? You hit me... You hit me? Me, your lawful wife? You hit me because of your lover? I, Irene, who holds the secret of your life? Well, get out of here then! You just wait! You'll see! Women! White people stuff! White people stuff! And us... always wanting to emulate them in a most servile way. Copying them. One day you'll tell me something new. Darling, did you have a good day? What's the matter, darling? For a week there was no way of communicating with you. I look at you, you don't see. I talk to you, you don't answer. - What have I done wrong, darling? - Leave me alone! Look, your child is about to change, like you. Night or day you don't want to look at me. What's going on, darling? - My love! - Leave me alone. Look at the women of your village. They're well-dressed. I don't even have shoes. Did you bring me here to make me suffer? I have no dresses, no shoes... I bought you 3 wrappers last week! Instead of moaning, put them on! And use them without shoes? What is this about shoes? We must restore some form of communication between us, darling! Give me your foot and I'll go and buy you shoes. Get out of here! Give me your foot. Put it up. That's it, it's going well. Darling... Look. I have your foot in my hands. I'm going back to town. I won't be long. Communication really must be restored between us in this house. See you. I'm going to buy my wife... some shoes in town. Who told you I am ill? This the measure of my wife's foot, so I can buy her shoes at the market. I'll get there, thank you. Yes, white people... White people and their stuff! I far exceed you. - You exceed me in what? - I exceed you. Bugger off! You say you exceed me. Exceed me in what? Shut up! I exceed you and I could beat you up. - Beat who up? - You. - Beat me up? - Beat you up! You're a bloody peasant, you idiot! I'm no peasant, and on top of that, I wear slippers. You walk barefooted. I exceed, you see? I am of noble origin, well-bred. My father left me valuable assets. I own plantations in my village. I've got money, what do you have? And if you find me amusing, I'll beat you up. Beat me up? Joseph didn't struggle for Marguerite the other day. Was it because of Ngasse? - Ngasse? Who is Ngasse? - You came for her. I was in Douala. - You were in Douala. What is Douala? - I was in Douala! I rode on vehicles, motorcars. I even flew like the birds. Here in the village, do you know what that is? - I went hand in hand with white people. - What? Just like that? Well, that's it! That's it! I'll go up that tree, I'll climb it and then jump. - Because you were in Douala? - That's what one does in Douala. You peasants here... I'll show you what I'm capable of. You boaster, show me what you're capable of. Not your everyday stunt, "I was in Douala! I used to live with white people". - Show us, then. - This isn't tor your teeth. Bastard! Yes. White people. White people and their stuff! But I assure you, they're not more intelligent than we are. White people! White people! White people! You don't know them. They're an odd lot. They are... not like us. They eat worms. And not just any worms, only tapeworms, I tell you.
