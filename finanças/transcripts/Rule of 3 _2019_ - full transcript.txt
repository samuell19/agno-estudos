- is he here? - Yeah. - I just realized that you're not back until the day before our anniversary. - Glad you reminded me. I mean, I knew that. - Mm-hmm. So, you have something romantic planned? - Not yet, but I plan on planning something romantic. - Well, for the amount of time you're gone for work, you better, or don't bother getting on your return flight. - Speaking of flights, I need to go. I'm gonna miss mine. - Ok, here. Selfie. - Mmm! - And now a funny one. all right, love you. - Mmm. Love you too. - Be safe! - I'm not going to the airport. Take me to montgomery street, please. - alison whitford? - Uh, yes. How can I help you? - I'm afraid I have some bad news. Your husband... ♪ ♪ ♪ - sorry to keep you waiting. I'm, uh, detective strickland, and I'll be working in conjunction with our accident investigation division. - All right. - I first just want to say how sorry I am for your loss. - Thank you. I appreciate that. - I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions. - Yeah, of course. - When was the last time you saw your husband? - Um, last night, around 7:30. - Where was this? - Uh, at home. Dominick called a cab to take him to the airport. - Newark? - Yeah. He was--he was heading to panama. He works in the mining industry. His job, it kept him out of the country for probably two thirds of every month, so... - Hmm. Mrs. Whitford, your husband's accident happened on the east side of the city. - That's in the opposite direction of the airport. - Do you have any idea why he'd be in that part of town? - None. No. - And, uh, where were you last night at 8:30 p.M.? - I was still at home. - Alone? - Mm-hmm. I'm sorry, why is this relevant? - we have reason to believe that your husband was struck intentionally. - What? Wh-- w-what are you saying? You think that... You think that dom was murdered? - There was a witness at the scene that saw the vehicle, uh, speed up prior to hitting him. - What? - Unfortunately, they were unable to provide a description of the driver. - Oh my god! Wait a minute. What do-- am I a suspect? - Excuse me? - That's why you asked if anybody could confirm that I was home? You think... - Oh, no, this is just a procedure to rule out the spouse. It's nothing to worry about. - Ok... - ok, now, I apologize for having to ask you this, but... ...Were you guys having any marital issues? - No. No. - You positive? - I'm, um, I'm a marriage and family therapist, so I think I'd know. - Well, too bad we didn't cross paths a while back. Maybe I'd still be married. so, you have no reason to believe he'd have an affair? - No, not at all. We've been married for less than a year. And we were apart so much that when we were together, we would, um, we would joke that... ...That we were still on our honeymoon. So, no. Why, do you? - Do I what? - Have reason to believe that he was having an affair? - let's get you home. I'll be in touch if I have any more information. - Thank you for seeing me without an appointment. I'm... I'm dominick's wife, alison. - Dominick? - Whitford. - Uh... - You may not have received news yet, but the reason that he didn't make it to panama is, uh, well... Because he died. - Oh, I'm--I'm so sorry. - Thank you. I--I'm just planning a celebration of life for him, and I was hoping that you could help me with some--some contact information for his coworkers. - Your husband's name is dominick whitford? - Yes, he... With the central american division. - Let me look for his personnel file. - Thank you. - this has everyone who's ever worked here, and nobody by that name has ever been employed by us. - I'm sorry, that's impossible, because dominick, he has worked here for years. - There are a number of mining companies based out of the city. Is there a chance you may have confused us with someone else? - Uh, I guess it's possible. I'm so sorry to have bothered you. - No, no. You were no bother at all. I hope you figure things out. - Thank you. What? you gotta be kidding me! - stay away from my husband! - Look, I don't know what you're talking about! - Don't lie to me! I know you're having an affair. If you don't end it, next time, instead of slitting your tire, I'll slit your throat! - Who is... - what's that? Answer me! Answer me. What is that? - That is my wedding photo. - Why is dominick in it? Answer me. - Because he's my husband. - Don't lie to me. - I'm not. - Dominick is my husband. - Ok... - He is! - I think that you're a little bit confused. - I'm not confused. - Stay there! Stay there! How did you get that? - Like I said, dominick is my husband! - That's not possible. - We've been married for 5 years, and we still are. - Dominick whitford? - Dominick mitchell, the person in this photo. - Ah! The detective, he said something about... Dominick having an affair. - What detective? - The... - What detective? Answer me! - You don't--you don't know? Dominick was hit by a car. - No! Is he ok? - No. - He... He's dead? Oh no! No! - How is it even possible that he was married to us both? - Someone from the special investigations bureau is looking into it, but I'm pretty sure one of you said "I do" to a fake identity. - Well, I was married to him first, detective, so her marriage must be fake. - do you have any leads on who the driver might have been? - Nothing concrete. - Well, what about her? - You think I killed dominick? - She attacked me and threatened to slit my throat! - Well, if you wanna press charges, that's a different department. - Don't tell me you're buying this whole naïve widow routine. I mean, she's--she's just trying to throw you off. - I loved dominick more than anyone. - Just be assured I'm looking into every angle. - And when are you gonna ask for her alibi? Because I was in here for less than 30 seconds before you treated me like a suspect. - I didn't kill him, detective. I swear. - Look... Marla is gonna get the same line of questioning as you did, as soon as I have a chance to speak with her one on one. I know this situation has come as a shock to the both of you. It's one thing to lose a spouse, but to have a bombshell dropped on you like this... Just know I'm doing everything I can to come up with some answers, ok? - Ok, thank you. - Why don't you head home? I'll be in touch. ok, I'm gonna have to ask you some questions. - what are you doing here? - I figure we could compare notes and try to figure out how this was able to happen. - No thanks. - Why not? - Because you attacked me. - I'm really sorry about that. I was just trying to save my marriage, or at least that's what I thought I was doing. look, I just--I don't that it is a good idea for us to interact, at least not for the time being. - The thing is... I don't have anyone I can talk to about this, at least anyone that can relate, except you. Please? Please. - all right. - Thank you. did you have a big wedding? - Uh, we actually eloped. - Us too. - Hmm. Did you ever meet dom's parents? - No, they died when he was in college. - he told me it was just a few years ago. Did he ever talk about an estranged brother living in oregon? - No, but he said he had a sister in florida who he never spoke with. dominick brought me the same statue back from a trip to panama. He probably bought them online in bulk. Do you want a drink? - Isn't it a little early? - Yep! - Dominick has the same bottle at our house. He saves it for special occasions. - Dom would kill me if he saw me doing this. His precious 40-year-old scotch... - well, it feels like we should toast to something, don't you think? - To karma. - I don't wanna toast to that. - Sorry, I... I guess I've had more time to process. - Listen, I'm upset with dominick too. - I'm more upset with myself for being so gullible. - Were you ever suspicious he was cheating? - No, not for a second. I... And I'm a couple's therapist. I listen to people talk about affairs all day. And then yet, when it's right in front of my face, I don't see it. - Yeah, well, that's because... You were in love. To love! - No, I'm not toasting to that either. - It's actually not bad this way. - so, how did I get on your radar? - I found a cell he had stashed that had a bunch of calls to your number. It took me a while, but I was able to track you down. I figured I'd confront you while he was out of the country, or so I thought. You know, he only tricked you for a year. Last month was our fifth wedding anniversary. - are you hungry? - Who brought you the food? - Mostly clients and neighbors. Everyone's been really great. - That must be nice to have so much support. I haven't told anyone yet. - What? Not even your family? - No, I don't know how I'm supposed to explain you to them. It's humiliating. I mean, not you, the situation. - No, I get it. Trust me, I haven't told anyone either, about you. - I wish we didn't have to. - why do we? - Don't you think the truth will get out eventually? - Maybe, but why do we have to be the ones to publicize it? I've got dom's death certificate, and I published an obituary. If you were to do the same thing, then we just pretend like we didn't realize the other one existed. It could work. - I hope so. I always brag to the women I waitress with how I have the perfect marriage, the perfect husband. It'll be humiliating if the truth gets out. - And it will be career ending for me. I mean, I took a chance, and I quit my job to start my own practice. And now that I'm finally starting to build up clientele... I mean, if this story gets out, who's gonna want marriage insight from someone who didn't even know that her husband had another wife? - Well... Let's keep it between the two of us. - Ok, that, I can toast to. To keeping it between the two of us. Marla! - Hi! I brought you dominick's bottle from our house. I figured you'd appreciate it more than me. - Thanks. - What's that? - Just packing up some of dom's things. - Are you giving them away? - Well, better than my first instinct, which was to burn them. - I bought him this shirt. I can still smell him on it. Try it. - I'm good. - Seriously. Just-- - you know what? I don't want to smell it. - Ok, sorry. - It's fine. - Can I keep it? - Uh, of course. You can keep whatever you want of dom's. So, why are you here? - I haven't been able to tell anyone yet about dominick being... Gone. - Well, if you want, I can find you someone to talk to. - Well, I have someone: You. - Oh, I really don't think that I'm your best option. - No, you're my perfect option. Not only do you understand what I'm going through, you have training in this sort of stuff. - Ok, and I-- I'm flattered, but I really don't think that I have the bandwidth to deal with anyone right now, except for myself. - You know, I--I couldn't sleep last night. I just lay awake wondering what life will be like without dominick in it, if I even wanna find out. - Hey, it'll get easier. - I hope you're right. I really do. - I am. - I always loved this jacket on him. It's so cool. are these for your house? - No. What is that? - Dry cleaning receipt. - why would he use this place? It's on the other side of town. - here you go! - Ok, that's $27? - Yes. - And my husband and I, we just moved. Do you mind checking what address you have on file? - Yeah. - Great! - I have apartment ph-303, 1435 carnarvon street. - That's the one. Thank you. - Why would dom have keys to a fancy place like this? - I have no idea. wow! Ok, 303. - This way? - Yeah. Dom was killed only a few blocks away from here. - Do you think this is where he was headed? - That would be my hunch. maybe we should call the detective. - we'll just take a quick look and go. Ok? - Ok. - Hello? Anybody home? - Whoa! that's not a bad view. - Yeah, this doesn't seem like the type of place dominick would live. hmm. - What? - It's dom's watch. - And these are definitely his clothes. - Just his? - Uh, yeah. Looks that way. - Hmm. Kind of looks like he just moved in here on his own. what's that? - Looks like a safe deposit box key. - Did dom have one? - I have no clue. - I wonder what's in it! - Are there any banking papers in there that go with it? - No, I don't see anything. - You keep looking, and I'm gonna go check the rest of the place. - Ok. - You know, I was thinking that maybe he's just renting a room. - Oh, I don't think so. Look. What? - Put your hands above your head. - We didn't break in! We have keys! - Keep your hands up! - I'm sorry. I'm just gonna show you the keys. They're in my pocket, ok? - Slowly. - Please... - Where did you get those? - Those--those are dominick's. - Why would he give you keys to our apartment? - You--you're... - Are you his... Girlfriend? - I'm his wife. - For how long? - What? - How long have you and dominick been married for? - Nine years! Who the hell are you? And women chatting, indistinct) - I'm sorry to keep you waiting. But I got some answers. Dominick volberg, born, uh, April 22, 1974, in madison, wisconsin. - So, she was married to the real dominick? - If by real, you mean his birth identity, then yeah. We've been able to confirm that both the identities you two married were fake. - Have his parents been notified? - Not yet. - What? They're still alive? - They live in palm springs with dom's sister. Do his girlfriends still need to be here? - Ok, just 'cause you showed up first, doesn't mean we weren't married to him. - Actually, it does. You can't legally marry someone that's already married. - You think you were a better wife than us? - I think I was his only wife. - Ladies... - I can see why he'd find someone else. - Well, you clearly didn't fill the void. Ok, let's... It's been a long night. It's emotional. Let's all take a breath and relax. - How about instead, you tell us that you have a lead on who might have killed him. - No, but I am starting to think it had to do with money. - Really, why? - He helped keep the lights on at 3 households. That ain't cheap. You know, we can't connect a legit source of income to any of his identities, real or fake. - So, you think he was a criminal. - Well... he was a con artist in his personal life. Chances are he was a con artist in his professional life. And in my experience, hustlers often have a best-before date. - cheryl! Cheryl, just a second! Wait! - What? - Look, I--I know that we didn't really get off to a great start, but we just wanted you to know that if you ever, you know, want to talk-- - you know what? I'm really not interested in forming some pathetic widows club with my cheating husband's mistresses. - I wasn't his mistress, and you were barely even still married to him. - What do you know? - He was staying in the den. He wasn't just sleeping there. He had basically moved in. You two were separated. - Even if that were true, it doesn't make you more of a real wife. - Maybe not, but it makes you less of one. And-- - hey! Just a second. Ok, we--we don't have to interact, but we were hoping to get on the same page in terms of discretion. - Meaning what? - Would you be willing to keep this whole bigamy thing quiet? If word got out, it could be very damaging to my professional reputation. - And why should I care about your reputation? - Fair enough, but what about yours? - It doesn't affect my job. - Ok. But I'm sure you're not doing backflips over the notion of having to tell people that your husband cheated with not only one, but two different women behind your back. - ok, fine. - So, you'll keep it to yourself? - Yes, is that all? - We need to decide what to do with his body. - No, we don't, because again, I'm the one that was married to him. - Dom wanted to be buried. - That's why I'm having him cremated. - You would actually do that? - I actually would. - What did dominick ever see in that woman? - You know what? I'm just happy that she is willing to keep our situation quiet. - That doesn't mean she's not a total bitch. - Sometimes, people, they-- they act like they don't care as a defense mechanism. - Why are you defending her? - I'm not defending her. I just know firsthand that, you know, grief can make people do and say the most horrible things. - Do you think the detective asked her about an alibi? - Yeah. I mean, he asked you and I. - Yeah. Ok, do you want to have breakfast? - No. You know what? I think I'm just gonna go home and crash. - Oh, come on. You need to eat, and we'll make it quick. - I'm so exhausted, I'm not even hungry. - Ok, I'll bring you home, then. - We live on opposite sides of the city. I'm just gonna grab a cab. - I really don't mind. Don't be silly! - No, marla, it's--it's fine. But thank you. - hi, yes. Is this the tip line? I'm calling about the man who was killed in a hit-and-run a few days ago. Well, it turns out he had 3 wives. No, at the same time. Mm-hmm. And one of them, alison whitford, she works as a marriage counselor. Yeah, that's right. She had no clue. - hello? Cindy, hi! Thank you. I... Thank you. I, uh... I appreciate that. It's--it's definitely been a rough couple days, but I do plan on fulfilling all of my appointments for my regular clients starting next week, so... Oh! Ok, no problem. Uh, we can reschedule. Oh, I see. Um, do you mind my asking why? This is a nightmare. - Any idea how it got out? - No, I don't know. Maybe somebody at the police station leaked it? - Yeah, maybe. Or maybe it was cheryl. - No. I mean, what-- what would she get out of it? - I don't know. It seems like something she'd do out of spite. - all I know is that the story got out this morning to some crappy local website, and I've already had 3 clients cancel. - Ok, well, with any luck, that'll be it. - No, word travels fast. I really doubt it. - Ok. You need to stay positive. - I need to make sure that this story does not become bigger. - A reporter called and asked me to comment, but I didn't give him anything. - Thank you. I appreciate that. - No problem. We're in this together. So, I thought we could try and figure out where dominick has his safety deposit box. - I didn't know you still had that. - Yeah, I put it in my pocket, then with all the chaos with cheryl, I pretty much forgot about it. - Uh, well, don't you think that we should give it back to her? - No. Why, do you? - No. But I... I mean, I wouldn't have a clue of what bank it belongs to. - I looked through all dominick's papers at home, and I couldn't find anything. Do you think there might be something here? dom sure liked to collect things, huh? - Yeah, apparently, that included women. - Hey, this is locked. - Uh... There's gotta be a key somewhere. - Yeah. So, you waited a while before you got married, huh? - Yes, I did. You hear all kinds of horror stories in my line of work, so I just wanted to wait till I was sure I'd found the one. Turns out that I am one of three. - Dom's actually my second husband. - Really? - Yeah, I got pregnant right after high school. He wasn't the greatest guy, but he proposed. I always wanted to do the right thing, so I said yes. - So, you have a child? - No. I lost the baby. - Oh, marla, I'm really sorry. Is that why the marriage failed? - I miscarried right after he died in an accident. - Oh my god! - I'm a two-time widow. isn't that a collector's item? - Not anymore! come on! ok... I don't bank with these guys. It's a bank contract for a safety deposit box, in the name of passmore. - Was that cheryl's last name? - No. Dominick passmore. - Well, let's go find out what's in it. - No, the only way you can get access to a safety deposit box is to have a matching identity with the name that corresponds with passmore, which we do not have. - Follow me. - Wha... So, how do you know this guy? - He made a fake id for a busboy at my restaurant. - And it held up? - Oh yeah. He claims he can get into bars all over the city without a single problem. - Marla, duping a bouncer is one thing, but a banker? It's a totally different level. - You'll be fine. Trust me. - I don't know why you think I'm the better choice to pull this off. - You were so calm at the dry cleaner's. You got this. - I hope that you're right, because impersonating the fake wife of a fake person is still very real fraud. - It's just I haven't got your name on file, mrs. Passmore. Uh, in fact, mr. Passmore's application states that he's single. - Really? You know what? We've--we've only been married a year. And knowing dom, he just hasn't updated it yet. You know? Um... Um, this is our wedding photo. - Uh, that's-- that's very nice. - Thank you. - But I am legally not permitted to allow a spouse access to a safe deposit box if his or--or her name isn't on file. - Right. And you don't think that you could just maybe make a--a tiny exception? - If he can come sign the appropriate paperwork... - Normally, that wouldn't be an issue, but he's stuck in panama, and he desperately needs these documents in order to close a... Well, a huge deal. - I'm really very sorry. - And when he does, he's gonna need a bank here to do business with, and I just know that dominick and I would be so very appreciative of you and your branch if you could just help us out. - If you could just give me a few minutes, I could find the appropriate paperwork to send down there to get notarized, and then sent back up. - Unfortunately, that won't work. The deal is very time sensitive. And if it... If it doesn't happen today, then, between you and I, dominick could lose millions. - Do you have a second piece of photo id? - Yes, of course! Of course! thank you. I appreciate it. - Thank you! Was there anything else I can help you with? - No, this is--this is perfect. Thanks again for your help. - My pleasure. - Ok. - so... Anything good? - Um... Depends. Do you like cash? - Ah! How much is that? - It's $30,000. - Oh my gosh! You have no idea how much I could use this. I didn't know how I was gonna keep up with my mortgage. Oh! - Well, I think that's gonna buy you some time. - Especially if we split it two ways. - I'm ok with that. And here. There are also these credit cards. - "dominick passmore." - and all these passports: One for dom and one for each of us with that same last name. - I don't get it. - Marla, I think that all of this is in case he wanted to disappear. - so, you think the detective was right when he said he was in trouble? - Yeah, I do. - And he wanted us all to go with him? - Or just-- just one of us, and, uh, and he couldn't decide who. - Hmm. I would have gone, had he asked. What about you? - No. what? oh my god! oh my god! - hi! Come on in. - so, how are the girls? - Good! Good. Emily's 7, and sophia's 4. - Hmm! That's cute. And how's gabby? - You really care? - No. No, I don't. you still playing? - why are you here, alison? - I need some legal advice. - Well, the city is full of lawyers, none of whom, besides myself, were you once engaged to. - No, but I need someone that I can trust. - You do remember why we broke up? - Oh, the irony is definitely not lost on me. So, you really haven't heard of my current situation, then? - If you're in trouble again, you need a criminal lawyer. - No, that's not what this is. And... I definitely need attorney-client privilege. Please. - $4 million. - Oh my gosh! We're rich! - I talked to a lawyer. We have to go to probate court in order to access the funds, but as long as we agree to split the money 3 ways, then it should be pretty straightforward. - I'm good with that. - I'm not. - Ok. How would you propose dividing it? - I wouldn't. - Sorry? - I'm the only one that was actually married to dom, so I'm the one that deserves the money. - This isn't fair. - No, what isn't fair is that I paid his bills while he earned an mba, I spent holidays with his family, put up with a mother-in-law who never thought I was good enough for her son, all to find out that my husband didn't think I was good enough either. This is more than fair. This is justice. - What did the lawyer say? - That cheryl being married to dom first and being married to his real identity gives her stronger legal claim to his money. - All of it? - Yes. I mean, he thinks that her attorney will likely argue that we were little more than live-in mistresses. - But that's not true! - I know, but all that matters is what the judge thinks, right? - Ugh! You know, I don't know what I'm gonna do without dom. I can't afford to pay my bills. I need my share. I deserve it. - Ok, so he suggested that we reach out for a settlement. - No! Definitely not. Agreeing to less means we agree to being lesser wives. - Who cares? So, what is the harm in at least asking her what she can offer? - ok, fine. We can talk to cheryl. - Great! I think it's best to have a lawyer reach out to her, though. The less we have to deal with that woman, the better. - Good thinking. You're smart. Oh, gosh. Ok, I gotta get back to work. I'll--I'll give you a call later. - cheryl, hi! - Where's your sidekick? - We agreed that it would better if I spoke with you on my own. can I come in? - No. - Ok, um, so, marla and I, we're willing to concede that you have the stronger legal claim. - Thanks for telling me something I already know. - But if--if we take this to court, it is gonna be expensive and it is gonna be time consuming for all of us. So if you're willing to make a fair offer... - I'm not giving you a cent. - Why are you being so vindictive? - Because you shouldn't be rewarded for being gullible. This isn't your payday. This is payback for marrying my husband. - Oh! I trusted you! - Marla, what are-- what are you doing here? - Then you go behind my back to make a deal to cut me out? - That is not what this is. - So, that offer you just made me to split everything 50/50 is off the table? - She--she is lying. - Ah! - I never offered that. - Then why are you here? - Because there is so much tension between the two of you that I was just hoping to have better luck convincing cheryl on my own. - And did you? - Well, we're about to get there. Cheryl... marla, I'm sorry. How did you even know that I was here? - I was just driving past and saw you getting out of your car. - So it was just-- just a coincidence? - Yes. so, I guess we're taking her to court. - No, I really hope that there's another option. - There isn't. - I just lost two more clients this morning. And another couple that's getting divorced is threatening to sue me with malpractice, so... So if I can't control the situation, I could lose everything. marla! What... I thought that you had to work today. - I, uh, called in sick. - Are you ok? - I'm pregnant! - oh! Uh, how do you know? - Well, I was late, so I--I took a home-pregnancy test. - Wha... Um, I'm... Congratulations! That's-- - thanks! You're the first person I've told. - Uh, how--how far along are you? - Just a few weeks. Um, I would have conceived the night before dom left my house and, well, came to stay with you. - So, it--it was planned. - Yeah, we'd been trying. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - 'cause, uh, it's funny, dom... He always said he didn't want kids. - Well, I guess it would have been too complicated to have kids with more than one of his wives. - Of course. Right. Hey, carrying his child, that would make your claim on his money far stronger. - Oh yeah! Oh, I hadn't really thought about that, but I guess you're right! - Hmm... - Can I use your restroom? Now that I'm expecting, I have to go all of the time. - yes, of course! - Thanks! - Of course. - hey! - Hey. - It just dawned on me that I was so excited to share my news that I completely disregarded your feelings. I'm sorry. You know, sometimes, I just, pfft, forget that you were married to dominick too. - It's, you know, it's--it's fine. Uh, I was--I was thinking, though, that you should probably make a doctor's appointment. - You mean to prove that I'm really pregnant? - No! No, not at all. Just--just to make sure that everything's ok. 'cause you did tell me that you had a miscarriage after your first husband died in an accident, right? - He was actually murdered. - What? - It's ok. He wasn't that nice to me anyway. Not like dominick. - Uh... I'm sorry. I... Anyway, if you... If you do wanna make a--a doctor's appointment, I'm happy to go with you. - Thanks! Oh, I had an idea how to convince cheryl to give us our share without having to take her to court. - How? - Well, if cheryl and dominick were having marital issues, which it's obvious they were, what do you think the chances are that she was with another guy? - Probably pretty good. - Right? So, if we can get proof, we can use it against her to keep this from ever having to go to trial. - You mean blackmail her? - No, encourage her to give us our share, what's rightfully ours! - Marla, I just... I don't think that that is a good idea. - Ok. Well, now that I'm pregnant, I can probably get all the money if this goes to court. But I'm thinking about what's right for you. - even if we did, how would we-- how would we prove it? - I still have the keys to cheryl's apartment. yeah. - ok, we don't know how long she's gonna be, so let's just get in, get out. - Ok. I'll check to see if the computer's password protected. - Ok. - It's not! - Great! Check her emails. I'm just gonna go upstairs. let's skip the drink and go upstairs. - All right! - um, I need to take a shower. You want to join me? - Sure. Marla! What are you doing? What are you doing? go! Now! - mmm! - let's just make this quick, ok? - The sight of her makes me mad. - I could have you arrested. - You won't. - And what makes you so sure? - Because certain people will realize that you weren't a devoted spouse, but a cheat. - Like the judge. - Or like the wife of the married man you're screwing. - We went through your friend's wallet while you were... Preoccupied in the shower. - You know what? I don't care about her. I'm single now. And I'll just tell the judge that I was with him to help me deal with my grief. - That won't work. We found emails to prove that you were screwing around for months. - With more than one guy! Well done! - What do you want? - We want our fair share. - Fine, I'll give you $100,000 each. - One third. - Ok, $250,000. That's my final offer. - You know, cheryl, what made you think that this was a negotiation? - You don't want to fight me, believe me. - Actually, I do, because I don't like you. - Marla... - You know what? I'll take my chances. I'll just explain to them that dom pushed for an open relationship. At this point, I'm thinking it's not a tough sell. - That might be a problem when everyone finds out that I'm pregnant. - You're pregnant? - Yes. And I'm gonna get every cent. - You may be knocked up, but it's not by dom. - You don't know that. - Oh, I absolutely do. He had a vasectomy years ago. - You're a liar. - You're pathetic. - Marla! Hey! - Let me go! - Hey! Hey! - You'll regret screwing with me. - Watch yourself! - Move it! - I just hate her so much! - Marla, what were you thinking? You can't do that! Especially if you really are pregnant! - Oh, you're gonna believe her over me? - No, not at all! It's just... You know, dom, he never expressed any interest in having children. - Maybe not with you. - ok, look, if she's still willing, I really think that we should take her offer. - No! No way! - She called our bluff. It's not like we were gonna show the video to anyone. - Says who? - We took that video illegally. It's inadmissible. The only thing it's good for is getting us charged with extortion. Do you get that? - Ok, fine! I won't use it. But I'm not accepting her offer. - well, I am. - So I guess it's every woman for herself, then, huh? - Yeah, I guess it is. - Ok. You can take a cab home! I know you don't mind. - unbelievable! - ah! - Alison whitford? - Yes? - I have a message for you. If anyone ever sees that video, you're going to be reunited with your fake dead husband. - and you can forget about any deals. - here you are! Sorry about the wait. - I mean, she said that she was gonna make us pay. - I never should have hit her. - No, this is not your fault, ok? Cheryl, she's--she's taken this to the next level. - Do you think she'll send him to my house too? - I don't know, but you have to be careful. - Ok, you should call the police. - And say what? - The truth. - I can't prove cheryl's behind this, but she can prove that we've been blackmailing her! - Now we have no choice but to take her to court. It's what dominick would have wanted anyway. - What do you-- what do you mean? - He made all three of us passports. He never had a favorite. He would have wanted us all to get an equal share of the money. I know him. Listen, I gotta get back to work. - Yeah. - I don't know, call me paranoid, but I don't want to be alone at home tonight. Would you mind if I stayed at your house? - Oh, of course! Sure, yes. - Thank you. I'll be by right after work, ok? - Great! Hey! You! - Alison, I can explain! - Save it! - I only wanted him to scare you, ok? The last thing I wanted was for you to get hurt! - You know, I don't want to hear it! - You didn't give me any other choice! - What? Ok, so let me get this straight. Sending a thug to my home to threaten me, then pretending it was cheryl, that's my fault? - You were just gonna let her get away with screwing us over and taking our money! I had to convince you to fight her in court! I did it as much for you as for myself. - Oh, you... You're crazy! - Don't say that about me. - And let's see. Who--who would have outed us, then, to the website about our story? I'm guessing that was you too, hmm? Unbelievable! - Alison, please! - Don't touch me! - We need to talk this out! - We don't need to talk this out. In fact, I never want to talk to you again, you psycho! Don't call me that! I'm not psycho! You hear me? I'm sorry! I'm-- I just, um... I spent time in a psychiatric hospital, and I really don't like when people say that about me. I'm not well. - No, no, you're not. And you stay the hell away from me! - Alison, please! - You stay away from me! - Can we just talk-- talk a little more? I just don't have anyone el-else. - ok. Cheryl, look, bef-- ok... Look, I, um, I just want to talk. - I could shoot you and claim self-defense. - I know. And I'm-- I'm so sorry. - Well, I don't care about your apology. - I want to accept your offer. I don't want us to go to court. - You should have thought of that before extorting me. - And I promise you, no one is ever gonna see that video. Don't worry. - I'm not worried. I showed the video to the detective. - Strickland? - Yeah, I think it was the highlight of his year. - what did you say? - The truth. You broke in, shot a sex tape, tried to blackmail me, and then the two of you assaulted me. - What? That-- that was marla. - That's not how I remember it. - so, are you going to press charges? - I could be persuaded to forgive and forget if you and marla were to sign off on any claim to the money. - so now you're blackmailing me? - Now, don't you just love the irony? - You do know that marla, she's never gonna go for this. - Well, then the two of you can be cellmates, and you can help her raise her fake baby in prison. Oh my god! - take these downstairs. you came to turn yourself in? - How much trouble am I in? - I'd say a class 1 felony typically falls into "a lot of trouble" category. - Right. - Well, let's put a pin in your lame extortion attempt for a sec. I got a lead on your husband's killer. - Really? - Come with me. We found the car that hit your husband. - You did? - It was reported stolen the day prior. The thief, uh, swiped the keys from a valet booth when no one was paying attention. But, uh, we got her on video. - Her? - Yeah. This woman wasn't just stealing a car. She was getting a murder weapon. she look familiar? - I mean, it's not a great picture. And given what she's wearing, it--it could be anyone. - Yeah, I mean, you put a wig and some sunglasses on, that could be you. - you don't actually think that I killed my husband? - Thought crossed my mind. - What, just because I'm a woman? - Your husband took cheating to a whole other level. Gives you motive. - Uh-huh. What about marla? What about cheryl? - Ok, as far as I know, neither of them bludgeoned their fiancée after finding him in bed with another woman. - ok, so, first of all, it wasn't just another woman. She was my best friend. And second, I didn't bludgeon him. I hit him with a tennis racket. - Yeah, till you fractured his skull. - Ok, I-- dom's murder, it was premeditated. And what I did, it was more akin to temporary insanity. And it was a very long time ago, whereas marla and cheryl, they're both permanently insane right now. - Ok, fine. What's your, uh... What's your case for cheryl? - Well, for starters, she's probably the angriest person I've ever met. - You haven't met my ex-wives. - and she was cheating on dom herself. Not to mention, pretty much every time I see her, she has a gun pointed at my face. So, there's that. - Sounds like you've given her some legit reasons. what about marla? - Oh, marla! Did--did you happen to know that her first husband was also murdered? - Still unsolved. - I know! What a coincidence. And then, earlier today, she had some goon from her restaurant come to my house and threaten to kill me. - Hmm. Thought you guys were tight. - Yeah, we were, until I realized that she is crazy. You seriously need to look into her. - I did. She's the only one who has an alibi for the night of the murder. - Oh. So, you just--you think it's either me or cheryl. - I do. But my money's on you. - alison... - I need to speak to graham about a legal issue. - Uh, he's out, but he shouldn't be long. - Ok, I'll come back. - Or you could wait inside. clearly don't need the money. - Well, that's the thing about money. You can always use more. - graham! Hi! He's narrowed down the list of suspects to cheryl and I, but he is leaning towards me. - Did he give you his reasons why? - My history of not reacting well to infidelity. - Well, he's got a point. that said, one could argue that I got what I deserved. - One could. Look, how much trouble am I in here? - Did you kill your husband? - Well, that depends. Are we still covered under attorney-client privilege? - Yes, but that was a rhetorical question. - No, graham! No, I didn't-- of course I didn't kill dom. No! - Ok... Let me put a call into the da's office. It might take some digging, but I'll see if this detective is just fishing or if he's actually convinced that you're guilty. - And if he is? We gotta put you in contact with an actual criminal attorney. But in the meantime, you are to have no contact whatsoever with either of dom's widows. Not only is marla a loose cannon, she's infatuated with her dead husband. Imagine how she'll react if she finds out you're the prime suspect in dom's murder. - That's a good point. - If this detective is right, and it was either you or cheryl who killed dom, and you maintain your innocence... - Which I do. - ...Well, it's pretty simple math who the murderer is. - and the woman driving the car had long red hair? - Yes. - But you didn't get a chance to look at her face? - Sorry. I was a bit preoccupied trying not to get shot. - Ok, well... - There is a witness. - Yeah, I have her statement. - Ok, so then why do I get the feeling that you don't believe me? - I'm not questioning whether someone fired a gun in your general direction. - Ok, then what are you questioning? - Doesn't it seem like a bit of a coincidence? I accuse you of murder, and the very next day, someone fitting the exact same description tries to kill you? - It's not a coincidence! It's a pattern. - calm down. - Ok, look, I will calm down when you stop treating me like a suspect, when it's obvious that I was supposed to be her next victim. - Exactly. It's obvious. - So, you really think that I had someone almost shoot me so that I'm less of a suspect in my husband's murder? - Yeah, the thought crossed my mind. - Great! So I--I just have to die in order to clear my name. That's wonderful. - ok, seeing as cheryl has a history of pointing a gun in your general direction, I'll ask her some questions. - And marla? Does marla know your theory that cheryl, or more likely me, killed dom? - Might have come up. - Then you should probably go question her too. Yeah. Ok. Yeah, I see. Mm-hmm. Well, thanks for looking into it. Bye. That was my contact in homicide. Strickland questioned marla and cheryl about your drive-by. - And what did they say? - Well, marla was at work with multiple alibis, but cheryl claimed to be home alone. - Well, then it had to be her. I mean, can't--can't they check the gun or something? - Not without probable cause. - Graham, she literally threatened to shoot me. Isn't that probable enough? - Not for a judge. Maybe, had they found a bullet, they could do a ballistics match. - Maybe if they searched for more than 20 minutes. - You heard what you thought was a gunshot. - It was a gunshot! It went right by my head. - Regardless, there's no proof of that. - Ok, great! I guess I just wait around for cheryl to try again. - I doubt she'd make an attempt so soon. - I'm glad you feel confident. - I'm not. Look, I--I'd offer for you to stay here, but with my girls... - No, and... ...Gabby would shoot you. - Well, she's on a flight over the atlantic right now and wouldn't have to know, but... But still, it's... - No. I'll, um, I'll be fine. - I'm sorry. - Look, my showing up has probably caused enough tension on your marriage as it is. - For not believing you. - You really thought that I killed dom? - I didn't not think you killed him. - cheryl, what are you doing here? - Drop the knife! drop the knife. Now put your phone on the table and sit down. - Ok. Ok, ok. Ok. - Go for it. - How did you get in? - Oh, I've been watching you for a while when I thought dominick and you were having an affair. I know where you keep your spare key. - Marla, I know the detective thinks that either alison or I killed dom. - He does. And I'm gonna find out who it was. - And then what? - Well, if you confess, and I believe you and I think that you're sorry, I'll let you live. - What if neither one of us admits to it? - Well, then I guess you're both gonna have to die. Easy. Now, starting with you. - Ah! P-p-please... - Listen to me carefully. Why did you do it? - I didn't. I-- marla, I didn't. - You're a marriage counselor. Dom made a fool of you. - Yes, he did, he did. And I was very, very angry. But I didn't find out about this until after dom was killed. - You. You were seeing someone days after dom was killed. And you acted like you didn't even care about him! You didn't care! - I was embarrassed that he picked the two of you over me. I would never hurt him. I--I loved him. He just... He didn't love me back. - Ok, so neither of you are going to confess? It had to be you. - What? - Ok, last chance, everybody! - Marla, don't! - Confess or I'll kill you! Confess! - It wasn't cheryl, ok? It wasn't cheryl. It was me. It was me. It was me. - What? - I saw you and dom downtown when he was supposed to be out of the country, and I just... I assumed that he was having an affair, but then I figured it all out. And for the second time in my life, I let myself love. And for the second time in my life, I got burned. - You killed him? - Yeah. Because he is a liar and he is a cheat and he used me. And he used you and he got what he deserved. - No! - oh my god! - Oh! I'm sorry! - It's just a graze. You'll be fine. - I'm sorry. - She's gonna be fine. It's ok. It's ok. Ah! I, uh... I just got a text from the detective, and he--he said he figured out who killed dominick, and that it isn't any of you. Uh, I don't understand. So--so you didn't kill him? - Of course not. - What? Well, why did you confess? - Because you were gonna shoot cheryl. - So, you--you'd risk your life for her? - Yes, I would. And for you, marla. I didn't want you making a mistake that will ruin your life. - Too late. - Marla... Marla, don't. Please. Please don't. - You know, I just came here 'cause I wanted to figure out who killed dom. I didn't want to get in any trouble. - And--and you won't. You won't. - I'm going to prison. - No, 'cause you-- we won't tell, right? - Mm-mmm. - Isn't that right? - You--you were just trying to get justice for dom. And you meant well. - Yeah, yeah. - You know, I don't know if I want to live in a world without dominick in it. - Hey... Think about your baby. - you know I'm not really pregnant. I wish I was, but I'm not. - That doesn't mean that you can't be someday. I mean, you're gonna make a great mother. - No, I don't believe you. - Yes. - I mean, you have-- you have so much love to give. And you're gonna find an amazing guy. - Yeah, but they won't be dominick. - No, he'll be better than dom, because he will love you and only you. But first, I need, uh... You gotta give me the gun. Ok? It's ok, marla. Give me the gun, marla. It's ok. It's ok. That's good. It's really good. Ok. - I'm sorry. - It's ok. You're gonna be ok. Ok, ok... - I'm really sorry. - It's ok. - so, I don't know how he found the time, but looks like there was another woman. this is security footage from the swiss bank a couple hours ago. - How did you get this? - Well, you know how they say to follow the money. I kept track of the money you guys were fighting over in case one of you tried to withdraw it and skip town. Figured she'd be my killer. That's why I, uh, accused the both of you of being a prime suspect. I thought I'd give you a little nudge. - You played us against each other? - For your own benefit. - Ok, just wait a second. If you said that you were following the money, then does that mean that she... - Oh yeah. She withdrew just under $1 million. - What? - Sorry, I kind of buried the lede there. She took out as much as she could without setting off alarm bells. - How did she access the accounts? - Well, she had the account information and a passport with the same last surname: Passmore. - Just stop, detective, please. Dominick had a fourth wife? - It was a fake id. She probably used it just to get access to the money. - Ok, I just really don't understand, because she just shot at me here yesterday. - Well, someone with that passport boarded a flight out of newark last night. I figure he either broke her heart or ripped her off or both. I'm really sorry for accusing you guys of killing him. I hope I didn't cause too much tension between the three of you. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ - hey, marla! - What are you guys doing here? - We're breaking you out. - Oh, but I--I'm here voluntarily. - No, we're just kidding.
