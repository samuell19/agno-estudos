If no one wants to buy, don't push it. Mister, we'll load this into the jeep. Yes, take them to Dado. Even if you get to sell them. You can only earn loose change from it. Hey, be careful you'll soften the fruit. You're really… What do you mean soften? Roman, why do you have to sell those to Dado? They're already rotten. I'll just get a receipt for this. ♪ We will ride on a carabao. ♪ I'll just get a receipt for this. ♪ We will ride on a carabao. ♪ ♪ In the river we will paddle. ♪ Clara! Isabel. Wait for me.

As if you’re doing something sensible. Hey, hey, we're still young, we should be having fun. And once you have a family of your own. What will you do for them? What? Let's go. Who else would take care of this? It's still Mang Emong. The assistant of Uncle Roman. I think Mang Emong isn't here. You already asked for his permission, right? Yes. What? Is it heavy? It's a cinch, I've even carried sacks and sacks of copra. But, let's rest first. Lando. Just one kiss. Someone might see us. Come on. Just one kiss. Why? You said, just a kiss? Isabel? Stop saying Sabel. A promise is a promise. I'm not going anywhere. Oh, Roman. Pilo! They haven't changed at all. Emong. Yes? Please take care of these bag. And. I'll take care of this. Diego? Roman! How are you? -Diego! How are you? -How are you? Please include these two boxes. Alright. So what? How are you? Here, we father and son are repatriates. Like what they say, the last card. It's good that you've come back to our place too. Hey, come here, come here. Here this one, please take care of this. It's only here where I know I can make a living. Is she little Clara? Clara, do you remember Diego? You've grown. Yes I have. -Dad, maybe we can go inside. -Just wait for a while Where is Leticia by the way? It's just me and Clara here. Alright then Diego. We still need to fix our things. Okay , Lando and Isabel will be happy. Once they know that you're already here. Isabel? How is Isabel? Ah, She's happy. She's now the girlfriend of Lando. Okay, I'll go ahead. Okay then my child. Thanks. As long as it's you. Come in first. No thanks. Dad will be coming home soon. The old man might need me for some chores. My child. There's good news from the capital. What is it mom? Roman came back . He came back with your friend, Clara. Clara. Mom, dad. Can I? Lando! What? I know that you always want to be with me, but.. This is too much. Crazy, They said, Clara is here. Let's go, come with me. The storm caused a lot of damage. I can't fix it because I don't have money. Don't worry Clara. It's easy to fix this. Yes. If you want Roman, I'll help you with the renovation. Or with the harvest. We will revive the business, Emong. -How's your harvest by the way? -It's good. It's just hard because I'm alone. It would be better if. You'll be the one to fix this house. And I'll continue the harvest. -Do you still know how to do that? -Let's see. -It's been 10 years I've had a break. -Yeah. Knock, knock. Wait, I'll go see who it is for a while. You can use any room that you want Clara, just let me know. Anywhere dad, as long as it has a window. Clara! You have visitors. Come, come in. Isabel? I didn't recognized you. You too. You look like a model. You're so sexy. Eh, It's hot in Manila. You got to be rally tall. Are you not leaving again? No, I will not. Lando? Yes. I heard he's your boyfriend now. Yeah, it's almost 2 years. Eh, wasn't he that naughty enemy of ours before? I'm still naughty until now. You look like it.. How are you? I'm fine. Isabel? Is that you Isabel? Uncle Roman! I've visited so many times, but I can't recall if you're that pretty. You've turned into a fine lady. Good afternoon sir. Good afternoon. Dad, do you still remember Lando? Of course. I saw Diego earlier. He's so young. He's like your brother. How are you? I'm good. Clara, I'll show you something. What? Uncle Roman, can she leave? Can we go for a stroll for a short while? Alright. Just look after my daughter okay? She's not accustomed to living in a province. I'll be saying goodbye as well. Thanks. Dad, let's just see each other later. Alright. I didn’t know it's still here. You know, I used to come here often before. Almost everyday. Waiting for you to come back. I just stopped coming here. Since Lando and I became a couple. By the way, where is Aunt Leticia? She left us. She left for another man. But leave it be. It's better this way, just me and dad. It's much happier this way. It's much happier because you're now here. Isabel, tomorrow remind me. After we deliver this, we will buy.. Mom. Can I not go with you tomorrow? Because of Clara? Okay then. Maybe you're really happy, because you’re together again. Yes mom. But, it seems like we're different now. But mom, it's just normal right? Of course, you haven't seen each other for 10 years. That's why there are things that are not the same as before. You're right mom. It looks as if she's still affected by Aunt Leticia's abandoning them It's like she has a different view about the world now. She looks sad. But she doesn’t want to show it. Such a pity. She's still young. And she gets to experience that. O, what Clara? How's your first day here? Dad, let's go back please. What? It's nice in this town. Small, not so many people, it's quiet and yet you still want to go back to the city? Gosh! Sorry dad. But at least if I'm in Manila. Whenever I'm bored. I get to watch cable television. Here, what do we do here? Laying around. Listening to the crickets. Gosh, it's really fun, fun, fun here. You know. I remember when you were young. When I told you that we were leaving for the city. You cried a lot. You said, Dad. Let's not leave this place. I don’t want to leave Isabel. You really! Because of you, It's your fault. You've been taking me everywhere, that's why I turned out like this. Don't blame me. Blame your mom. Then it’s good that she's no longer around. Isabel. Oh? You're early. Why not? I have nothing to do. I can't go shopping. And it's so hot. Come on, Let's go out. Come on! Let's bathe in the river. I don’t want to. It's embarrassing. Why? Are there a lot of people living there? Not really. But then. But then what? We're no longer kids, someone could see us. What's with you? It's okay. We're not gonna take our clothes off. Okay fine. If you don’t want to, I'll go on by myself. Okay then fine. I'm coming with you. Just as I thought, you can't refuse me. Okay for awhile, I'll just finish this. Let me help you. Do you still weave? I've progressed a lot, I can now do bigger ones. And I'm helping mom. While my dad brings them to town. So how are they? Are they fine? my goodness, what they were then, they're still the same now. Eh, do they approve of Lando? They do? Gosh, while he was courting me. They were already hinting that they like Lando so much. You. What have you seen in him? He's thoughtful. Sweet. Sometimes, he can get too sweet. Has something happened? Happened? What? Have you had sex? Clara, please. So what now then? There's a lot of things the could happen in two years. Right? But we're not yet married. So? What are you? Of course, it’s much better if we both wait. Okay fine. If that's what you say. Try to have sex. It's not yet the right time. I really missed this. I stopped coming here since you left. Really? It's not fun going here alone. O we're together now so what are you waiting for? Let's go. Let's go. Isabel, come on. I don't want to, I don’t have an extra clothes. Oh yeah, come on let's go back. Come on, gosh you might get sick because it's cold. Leticia. What is it Roman? None Nothing. Hey, you guys. You didn't invite So then come on, let's go back. I've had it, I'm already feeling cold. So what now, it's just the two of us. Hey! You! Oh, I was just teasing you. Alright, I'll just have a change of clothes inside. Then, I'll go home now. If you want I can lend you my clothes. No thanks, I'll go home now. Clara, what's with you ? There's a lot of people along the way. Will you take a look at yourself? Myself? Why? Is there anything wrong? Is there anything you see? It's up to you. As long as, if you get sick, don't ever put the blame on me. Your girlfriend is so conservative. She's really like that. I can no longer do anything about that. You can't do anything? Or you're really not trying? Where is Aunt Natie? She went to town. While dad is with Mr. Miyo. Lando. Lando. -Isabel -Lando. -What's wrong with you? -Wait, I love you. Don't. Damn it. It will eventually be mine. Give it to me now. Lando, watch your mouth. Please. What we want is not what's important. What's important is what's right. We will end up together, anyways. What's the problem with that? But I can't do it. This is wrong, if I will do it now, I will suffer. I can't see anything wrong. We love each other. Or you just don't love me. What? You talk too much. Look All of your mom's memories are in this house. She rarely goes out and she seems allergic to grass. I should've seen it before We are really not compatible. but it's a good thing you stuck it out. If you haven't, this pretty girl won't be here. You're too conceited. You know Natie. The customer liked the cloth that you made. So they said an order for more will be placed by next month. Really? It's because the one who made it is really good. Aren't you happy dear? What? What seems to be the problem? Nothing . I just had a spat with Lando. Why? It's just natural. Even i and your mother, quarrel once in awhile. But if you love him, it will be okay. Come on and eat, my child. Uncle Roman. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't intend to startle you. That is nothing. my apologies. So what are you doing here? I just want to ask for some coconut shells. I already told Mr. Emong. Oh my, Mr. Emong is not here. I asked him to finish the house. Eh I told him, I will do the harvesting here instead. It's been a while. So this happened. Yeah. Can I already get some coconut shell? Alright, it's there. Alright, thank you. Isabel! Clara. What are you doing here? Coconut shell. She's getting coconut shells. Come on let's eat. No thanks, I'll just eat at home. Oh my, You haven't tried Clara's cooking yet. You should try it, Isabel. Mom could be waiting for me. No, let's do it this way. I'll just cook and then go to your house so you can try it. There, you go to the house ah. Around seven pm ha? Come on. Don't worry I'll send you home. Bring Lando too. Gosh, no. Don't bother Lando. He might be doing something. No, I'll see if he's available. No you don't have to. That man has a lot of work. Are you still mad? Not anymore. By the way. Clara is inviting us tonight. We will have dinner at their place. Alright. Are you studying, Isabel? I stopped for a while. I got to reach second year high school only. Mom needed my help. But perhaps by next year, I'll go back. You? I've already finished high school. I'm about to go to college. As you know, things got complicated. If you want to continue your studies. we have a college here. There in Pindasan. I don't want. They might be offering purely agriculture courses only. Emong works fast. He finished the roof right away. So you're the one harvesting for now. Yes. I should practice. Are you drinking Lando? Yeah sure. Me, I stopped. It's not good for your body. Isabel, how's my daughter? Isn't she used to this town anymore? Dad. No Uncle Roman. It seems like Clara hasn't left this place. Gosh Clara. The men here. They all have masculine bodies because of the work. So take care of my daughter okay? I'm sure she'll get mystified by the good looking men here. Mom said, that those who are buying our cloth. Are famous people. You know, maybe. If you would sell those cloth in the city. I'm sure it will be around 2,000 pesos or higher. Lando. Do you need anything? How long can you finish a cloth, Isabel? Sometimes, it would take me a week. It would be faster if.. So it's a good source of income. Mom said, she can't leave me anything. But this skill. Isabel, teach me to weave. I'm so bored here. Okay I'll teach you. But you need to be patient. She said patience Clara. Dad, I'm patient. Lando can you hand over the water, please. You Lando. What is your job? I'm harvesting, sometimes. I'm also driving Mr. Lito's jeepney once in a while. Hey Lando, let me ride sometime. Lando reached 2 years in automotive. He knows about the engine. But you still doesn't have a permanent job. Not yet. Do you like my cooking? Why? Nothing. Why do you look annoyed? I think he's embarrassing me on purpose. Who? That damn Roman. Lando, he's just asking. I don't know. He seems to have some grudge against me. You know, you're just assuming that. I know him. He's a good person. Uncle Roman is like a father to me. Father? Is there a father who looks at you like that? What? Haven't you noticed? That old man is stripping you by the way he looks at you. You have a dirty mind. What's happening to you? So I have a dirty mind now? Damn that Roman. Good day Aunt Natie. Clara, why are you here? Is Isabel there? I just want to ask her to come with me to the river. Isabel. - Clara is here. - Oh , Clara! Isabel. Hi Lando. You were just like this when you were young. Clara will arrive. And Isabel will eventually forget about her chores. Aunt Natie, that's not so. Okay fine. Come on Isabel, let's go to the river. Lando. I thought we'll spend time together all afternoon? I have a rival for your time. Hey Lando, I heard that. Why don't you just come with us. Never mind. I'll just go. Aunt Natalie. I'll go ahead. Ah, okay -Just come here tomorrow morning. -Oh? No kiss? Or just kiss the wall? Clara, be quite, mom is here. Gosh. It looks like Lando got annoyed. He's annoyed because you came here with me. No. He's supposed to go home early. Where does he live? Just there in Bigo, near your place. Wow, okay. Does he have a brother? He has a sister, Teresing. But she's living in the store. Why? What a waste. I thought it was a guy. Lando is handsome. He's just grouchy. Have you and Lando talked about marriage? Yes. But not the date. If you're here it seems like it's so easy to plan out your life. Yes, but sometimes, you could get anxious in here. You can still see a lot of places. Which you can go to. You know sometimes, I was thinking. One day, I'll leave everything behind. I will pack my things and leave without a warning. I've already saved a little. Really? You want to get out of here? You can leave this place? And you want to? Yes. But the thing is, I can't leave my parents. And Lando. Are you prepared? Prepared for what? You know. When the time comes. Can you make him happy? Clara! I will eventually learn it. You're wrong. Do you know why a lot of men cheat? Why? Because the girl doesn't know how to make him happy. Being good in bed is important. Is that a saying? How can a girl learn then? Ask someone to teach you, someone who knows. Like me. What do you know? We're both the same age. You! Why? You know you're so cute. You're like a kid. Sister Clara, are you still a virgin? You should save yourself for the right time, right? So what? What do you mean? I'll teach you. I don't want. There's nothing to lose. And I'll just show you how to do it. Where? Here? There's no one else in here. I don't want. You're just scared. Scared of what? Of yourself. I can't understand. You might feel something towards me. Of course not. Why, don't you trust me? I do. What are going to do? So now, show me how you kiss. Go, Hello? Isabel we're best friends right? Right? What's that? Kiss. Kiss? You call that a kiss? It's not like that. This is how you should kiss. Okay? Clara. Doubled? That's hard. It's because, I'm always lifting. I mean the wood. What are you doing in here? Nothing. I'm just visiting, I've nothing to do. Why? Don't you want to have visitors? I just don't want anybody to see you here. You know the rumors in this town. You're scared that Isabel might know? I'm not scared of anything. I just don't want her to misunderstand. What will she think? Or you might be the one having thoughts like that? When you can no longer keep your thoughts. Just come to me, okay? Roman, why are you here? Uncle Roman. Good afternoon. I have something from Clara. For you. So you can try her dish. Thank you. You even bothered. Have dinner with us. No thanks, I'll go in the farm. By the way, where's Miguel? He went to the town to buy some stuff. Come on, he'll be here soon. Oh! Come on. Let me do it. Gosh, you got wet. Just stay till the rain stops. -No problem. -Isabel, isn't it ready yet? So your uncle Roman can have coffee. This won't take a while mom. So how's Clara? It's hard for Clara to accept what happened. She changed. She wants to take revenge on Leticia. So Isabel, I'm pleading. You could help out in any way that you can. That's why I thought of coming back here. So we can start all over again. Sometimes, I feel like it's my fault. I had no idea, what's happening to her. Don't blame yourself Roman. Leticia also hurt you. I hope our moving back here can make things better. I know that Isabel can do a lot about that. So Clara can get better. Isabel, heat this up as well. Eat? Eat? Let's eat, Uncle Roman. Uncle Roman. Oh, Isabel. I know that you're here, so I came here instead. I'll just return this. Please say thank you for me. Gosh. Uncle Roman, you’re sweaty. Gosh, don't let your sweat dry up. You might get sick. Thank you. Alright, I'll go ahead. What? Wait, come, drink first. I know that your house is quite far from here. Thank you . Isabel. Lando! You mom said you're here. I thought you might be carrying a lot. I'm on my way home anyway. We'll go ahead. Thank you . You really need patience on this Clara. I told you right? The Right. Isabel. -I'm not interested with your philosophy. -There, insert it there. -Here? -Yes -I'm interested with your life. -It should be even. -There, get it from there. -Here? There. So how are you? I'm good. Gosh. there is.. -And then? -Step on the left side now. -Left. -The left, so this will open up. -So now, insert it. -No. -You and Lando, is there any progress? -I'll get it from here. Gosh Clara, what are you? I don't want it. You know that I'm not comfortable with that. -Step on it. -Don't you feel tempted every time you see his hard body. Clara! Isabel, the feeling of lust is normal. So If I were you, don't avoid it. Don't restrict yourself. Have you had a lot of.. Sex experience? Of course. Have you had a lot of boyfriends? Not really, just two. And those you spent it with? Wait. One, two, jun, seven..twelve. Twelve? It was like, once a month. Oh wait. That's wrong. Twelve? Oh! It's fourteen Clara, you can do it even if you don't love the man? Of course. Isabel, sex is a necessity. And it's not just psychological. Even the animals. They're having sex all the time. They love it. I don't know, I can't understand why. People look down on you once they know you, have sex frequently. Gosh, I'm sure they're just envious. Clara. Making love is a sacred thing. You should do it with just one person. The one you're going to spend your life with. Isabel, you're being like that again. Sex for me is like food. I'm hungry, I want Ice cream. I'm lusty, that's why I wanna have sex. It's just like that. Lando! Come here. Oh, she's here. Nothing, we're just talking about you. Gosh, don't believe her. She's just teasing. Look, she's teaching her how to weave. By the way, I brought you something. Really? Oh my, Thanks. Oh my, I think I know what this is. My favorite. I know. Yummy. Damn it! Clara, why? I don't want this anymore. Just be a little patient. Look, you're doing great. I don't have patience. Clara? What's her problem? I don't know. Clara. Are you sick? Oh, are you throwing another tantrum? No. I just want to ask you to accompany me. To Isabel's house. So I could tell her that I'm sorry. That's good. You hurt her yesterday. Yeah. I can't also understand why I suddenly got mad. Are you available now? Alright. Are you hurt? No. Can you walk? Maybe I just need to rest for a while. Take me to the farm first, it's just near here right? You know that I can't get along with your dad. Dad is not there. He asked Mr. Emong to help him finish the house today. Come on, take me there, I can't walk. Let's go. I'm sorry, it's just so hot. Please hang it there so it would dry up. And please shut the door. Your shirt is wet too. Isabel. Dear, what's the problem? Knock, knock. Knock, knock. What do you want? I just want to talk to Clara. She went out. Where did she go? I don't know. Do you know at what time will she be back? You’re really persistent. Why? What do you want from Clara? I just want to talk to her. You have nothing to discuss with my daughter. Clara! Dad! Clara, stay here don't go outside. Dad no, I'll just go to Isabel's house. We had a fight earlier, I just want to say sorry. I want to talk to Clara. They just left. She said, they will go to your house. She's with Lando. Isabel, Isabel, why? Isabel? They didn't go to the house. I saw them. I saw them at the fire place. Why? What have I done to your daughter? What? Lando and Clara. They betrayed me. They're both traitors. Traitors. Clara can't do something like that. That's what you think. No, Clara has changed. Clara, is no longer the same. You no longer know your daughter. I know that she's like that. But why me? Why has she betrayed me? Is there anything I've done? - Have I done something wrong? - Nothing nothing, nothing. My friend, I love her so much. I love Lando. You, do you love me? Yes. I love him. I love Lando. Isabel. I love Lando. Isabel. Isabel. Isabel. Let's stop doing this. What? I don’t want to hurt Isabel anymore. But it's just so good. This is not the time to joke around. Why? Can you see anyone smiling? Stop it. Lando it hurts. Lando. Ouch! -Why are you complaining? -I thought you like this? I thought you're game? Go ahead. Go ahead Lando. Lando, I'm just tired. Ouch! Ouch! Lando that's enough. Lando that's enough. Where's the yellow one? Here. There. Good evening. Isabel, my child? Dad sorry for what happened earlier. I won't go with Lando anymore. Promise. Alright, dear. I'm sorry too. You shouldn't be saying sorry dad. You haven't done anything wrong. Sabel, let's eat. We got so worried about you. How are you now? I'm fine now mom. Lando and I just had a fight yesterday, but it's okay now. Hay. Love is just like that. I just felt bad that you haven't finished what you're doing yesterday. That's beautiful. Don't worry mom. I will start doing it again. By the way. Me and your mom will go to the town. To talk to Mrs. Mila. To get her orders. Do you want to come with us? No thanks dad. I'll just rest here. We will be home late. you don't have to prepare food for us. Go ahead and eat. It's hot right? Yeah. Turn the air-con on. Dad, we don't have an... I know, I'm just joking. I'll go to the farm okay. You? Are you going to visit.. maybe not. I'll just rest here. I love you my child. Isabel. Lando. Do you love me? Of course. How much do you love me? I love you so much. What kind of question is that? What if I've done something wrong, will you forgive me? What? Are you going to forgive me? I can't understand you Isabel. What is so hard to understand? Lando, are you going to forgive me, if ever I've made a mistake? What kind of mistake? How terrible is that mistake? Is there someone else? Lando, Is there anything else? What? I'm confuse, I don't know what to say. Let's just talk tomorrow. Whatever you did to Lara, Uncle Roman did it to me. Every moan, every orgasm that you've felt. Every hug, sweat, saliva. Every move, he did it to me. Every hug, sweat, saliva. Every move, he did it to me. We did it together. Do you understand Lando? Even If I didn't intend to do it. Something happened. Do you understand me? I was seduced. I'm not sure if I was also seduced. He raped you. No. No Lando. Damn that Roman. Where's your stupid dad? He's not here. Why are you being like that? Where is he?
