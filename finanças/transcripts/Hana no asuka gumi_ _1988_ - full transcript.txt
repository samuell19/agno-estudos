NEW KABUKI TOWN IN 199X THE STREETS ARE OVERFLOWING WITH DRUGS AND VIOLENCE STREET GANGS (RED NOSE GODS) SECRET GIRLS' SOCIETY (GROUP-HIBARI) THEY ARE CONTROLLED BY THE CORRUPT K-OFFICER OF THE SHINJUKU 4TH PRECINCT (PB-4) THE GLORIOUS ASUKA GANG! Get out of the way, old hag! What the hell!? You're the one who should watch out! Red Nose Gods! Bringing some red beads nose medicine! Red beads nose medicine! Well, well... What do we have here? You punks. You're all under arrest. Right on. Come and get us. You're through. Or can't you hear well, huh? Arthur. Why don't you give it a spin? Arthur. It takes a lot of time and effort for us to call for backup. No kidding? Take this! Come and get some, bitch. Let's roll! Hurry up! Hey, you! I didn't take no insulin! Get your weapons out! You bitch! Get her! Hurry and get her! Don't let her run away! Yoko. What's the meaning of this!? Are you good with all this? You reek. Have you been inhaling too much of that red shit? You're the one who reeks here. You've been supplying them to us, and on such short time... We can't let this stand. You're weeping. Go back to mommy. You're the one really weeping here. Look at all this mess. Maybe Lady Hibari ought to know about this. Just who do you think you're talking to!? The proprietor girl of Hibari Pharmacy, who produces and wholesales the goods. That's who I'm talking to, Yoko. You mocking me? Don't get cocky. Was that little bitch one of yours? What little bitch? Don't bullshit me. I'm talking about Asuka. Asuka? You bitch! Eat this! Hurry and kill her! Kill her! Kill her! Fuck off! Kill her! Finish her off! Let's move, Asuka! You were slow! What took you so damn long!? Asuka, stop it already! Why do you keep insisting!? Toki Masamune. How many generations have you been here? Toki, times are changing. Things have been going well until now. For you, me, and Lady Hibari too. What are you trying to say? It's simple, really. I'm ready for the real deal. I'm not opposed to taking a little of it now. Listen, old timer! Don't be getting any ideas. The way it is now should be sufficient for you. Toki... You still don't seem to get it. Just who do you think's letting you deal business out on the streets, huh!? If only the PB-4 would be willing to... That seems to be your problem, not ours. Lady Hibari believes that no one benefits from infighting. Listen, your highness. This ain't the time for your high-minded proverbs. I ought to remind you. This whole mess was started thanks to your Asuka! Asuka has left our group. She dumped you, huh. Lady Hibari. My brother's territory got trashed, seven honorable officers also got beaten up. And yet, we're suppose to take this sitting down, huh!? Who's gonna take responsibility for this!? Good grief, you really moved me to tears. I'm gonna kill you, Toki. Once Asuka's out, it'll be your turn. I'd like to see you try! If you can. Men and women just can't seem get along. Or in this instance, women and women? We will provide the PB-04 with compensation. As for you, Toki, we'll provide you with additional red beads. -That's all? -Yes. We'll also be handling the troublesome abscesses. -Works for me. -I don't quite like it! I suggest you refrain from complicating this any further. Lady Hibari! Consequently, all the street partitions will remain the same. Hi. Hi. How you doing? Thank you, thank you. Thank you. Hi. No problem. Asuka, let's blow town. -Why? -You're asking why? Because we hit Toki's red beads and the K-Officer's cash. We can't waste any more time. This is a peaceful world. Only the kids are at war. Peace only exists in that thick skull of yours. Miko, what about your sister? -Like I care about her. -But she's your sister! She's not even my blood sister. The only thing connecting us is my stupid old man's White Calpis. Calpis? Asuka. You used to be Lady Hibari's kitty cat, right? That's gross! I bet that must've been nice. Zip it, or I'll kill you! Yoko. Why did Asuka set this up? I have no idea. No clue at all? After she left us, Asuka elected to work by herself. Is that right, Yoko? I believe so. Was it not you who introduced Asuka to us? That's right. Yoko. Who is Miko to you? She's my sister. Asuka and Miko robbed the red beads and the K-Officer's cash. Asuka is your friend. Miko is your sister. What say you, Yoko? I swear... I don't know anything! Very well. Yoko. We'll allow you to continue dealing with the red beads. However, Asuka and Miko will pay for what they've done. Are we clear? They'll pay for everything. You'll do the deed. You'll be the one to kill Asuka. As you wish. Asuka. You're Asuka, right? Sell me some of that red stuff. You're the person to go for them, right? The hell are you on about? Arthur and the rest told us so. Sell them to me! Asuka, sell me the stuff. I want the red stuff, Asuka! I want them! Give them to me! Asuka! Asuka! You were dumb enough to fall for our trap. Consider yourself history. Asuka. I suggest you throw away that bottle. After her! Kill her! Asuka! Hurry up and kill her! Asuka! Yoko... Kill her! You bitch! Little girl! Get the fuck out of my way! I said, move it! You bitch! Run for it, Asuka! Just trust me! You fucking bitch! Get ready, Asuka! Asuka! You're dead meat! You're dead! Get back here! Toki. How come you haven't been indulging me lately? Am I still not enough? Be quiet! Yoko. Was that a threat against me? Did you forget about your place in the world? What do you mean my place? Yoko. You're a bright girl yourself. Can't you see the times we're living in? You think this is the time to get all clingy!? Spare me your tales of past time. I never brought up the past! You sure you wanna get all high and mighty with me? Just leave. You're through here, aren't you? Well, Yoko? Fine. I'll leave. You do that. Get better, okay? And don't forget, you gotta settle the score with Asuka. Yoko! Yoko. These red beads of yours are far out. Yoko... Where did Asuka run off to? How should I know!? Yoko... Does Hibari know? That you and Toki have a thing going. Maybe I oughta inform Hibari. Yoko. Where the fuck is Asuka, huh!? Where did you stash her at!? I said I don't know! Yoko... What is it about Asuka that made you yield? Doesn't it piss you off? She took from our men, and just as we almost had her, she managed to flee. Not even the Hibari 2nd in command went unscathed. Are you through? Don't get impatient, Yoko. I'm willing to handle Asuka for you. Once she's disposed of, all will be put back into place. Just take us to where she's hiding out. Asuka. Why did you go by yourself yesterday? It was part of my plan with Yoko. A plan? By seizing their red beads and starving them, they'll start to squabble, giving us a chance to take down Hibari. That's the gist of it. And you trust Yoko? I do. She just has her unique way of handling business. Still, those guys were there waiting for you. Asuka. I'm not keen on going along with Yoko's pipe dream. But I enjoy working with you. So there. That's probably why I agreed to infiltrate the K-Officer's shop. I was sold on your whole plan from the start. I hate to break it to you, but I've been rolling with Yoko for longer than you. You just don't get her true ways. Even in the worst of times, she always managed to remain cool and collected. Back when I was little, she was already a big player in Hibari's gang, and a grown lady. You got one hell of a sister! Perhaps because I admired her... I also joined Hibari's gang. And you know the rest. Hibari's true nature became apparent. That fool Toki stirred me and Yoko up, and I got out. Men and women are so dirty together. It's dirty because it's men and women, right? Can I help you, Yoko? Tell them I'm here. Asuka. I'm sorry for hitting you last night. Last night? Miko, the hell's your issue with me? Lay off her. Yoko. What you just said is just hilarious, with an air of danger. Hibari deities disappear from the streets, while you pussy foot your way neatly. It'll be freedom and equality if we all do away with dirty red beads and cash!? The upside's that everyone works for one person, and one person dies for everyone! Are you making fun of me!? Who's making fun of who!? Yoko. You wave the flag, take to the streets, and what happens after that red wind? It'll be because of you! Take it easy-- I can't do that! Whether it's a sweet wind or harsh wind, someone has to blow them, otherwise the wind will never blow! You always had a way with words. They're hard for kids to get. There's no kids here! This dream of yours is insane! A sweet taste that quickly dissolves. That perfectly describes you, sister! -You can call it quits if you want. -I'm not the one quitting! Stop all this nonsense and take down Hibari yourself! Yoko, I'll hear you out. Asuka! She needs to leave! Shut up! Both Hibari and the K-Officer still have my trust. I'll try to keep things under control. -But-- -But, what? -Toki-- -What about Toki!? He threatened me. Said he'll kill me if I don't deliver the red beads and cash. Yeah? Jeong Jang! Jeong Jang! Arthur, where do you think we are!? -I'm sorry! - Huh!? We're in Japan! So speak Japanese! I'm sorry, sir! It's just that... Asuka's coming! Hey! It's been a while, Toki. You finally surrendering, Asuka? Listen, Toki... You'll get a puncture if you keep puffing yourself up. What are you on about? I hear you're trying to take the streets. Well, that's interesting. Now, who gave you that brilliant idea? Your reputation precedes you. So, are you gonna kill me? I see it now. That K-Officer's started running his mouth. K-Officer? Yep. Asuka. Quit the games and just join my squad. Your time's almost up. I came here to talk about the red beads. Asuka... What's on your mind? Are we gonna talk business or not? You snatched the red beads from us. You and Miko managed to snatch that dummy K-Officer's money. It's been nothing but a mess for us. If the link between me, the officer, and Hibari collapses, who stands to benefit? Hey, Asuka. I thought you said you wanted to roll solo? I do roll solo. Asuka... You can't take control the street all by yourself. Still, you managed to cause quite the stir. Asuka. If you were to drop dead, it'd greatly please only the K-Officer and Hibari. Asuka... That'd be except me. By the way, Asuka. You and Yoko are best buds, right? What are you trying to say? Well, it's just... One of your friends will be delighted to see you go. Just something that I recalled. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. I'll be back. Asuka. Come join me. I wouldn't join you, even in your wildest dreams. Then, I guess you'll have to die. That Asuka and Toki are teaming up! Are you certain of this? They were on Cafe 419, I checked it out for myself. From whom? Is it from Toki? Or perhaps from Asuka? Don't you trust my word? That fucking Toki. I can't believe he and Asuka were in it together from the start! Do you intend to take action? Listen, Lady Hibari. How can you be so unwinded? If we get rid of Toki, our profit split goes up! Let's get this over with and enjoy ourselves. You should chase away the flies on your head first. You punk. Watch your tongue! Excuse us. Help! Somebody help! Attack! Move in! We took down those Chinese guys! Don't shoot! Glad to have you with us, Toki. I'm happy to have you as a friend. Wanna drink? No need to hold back. What's this all about? Toki. Times have changed. Your group's time on the street's just about up! You can't pull a fast one on the Red Nose Gods! Screw your filthy tricks! Arthur. Lucky for you... I happen to be in a cherry mood today. Stay in your lane! If you value your life, that is. I understand. What do you want from us? It's simple, Toki. Die like a good dog. Keep down the door! No guns! Keep them out till I okay it! Okay! Asuka. Miko isn't coming back. Hibari's gang got a hold of her. The young ones say Yoko set it up, but I don't know how true that is. Yoko did? In addition, the K-Officer killed Toki. Red Nose has been totally wiped out. But here is here, and you are you, Asuka. Do what you need to do. Michiko. I need you to take care of something for me. The red beads, right? It'll cost you. Leave it to me. I'll take care of them, don't you worry. The gun. Take this with you, I'll give you a discount for it. We're taking to the streets. Yoko! We have orders not to answer, so please stay put! On who's orders? Who gave those orders!? It was just now! Lady Hibari told us to stay put, by all means! Who? Who's this "Lady Hibari?" Who is this person you speak of!? Tell me who the hell is she!? Tell me. Who the hell is Lady Hibari? Please no more of this, Yoko! You can't do that here! Yoko! Please, enough is enough! What if Lady Hibari finds out-- What was that!? -Yoko! -Stop it! Please stop! Yoko, please... We're begging you, stop! Yoko! -Yoko! -Yoko! Yoko! Yoko! Some good red nose medicine... So you're awake, Yoko. Asuka... You're gonna kill me, aren't you? Just get it over with. So that means you did it. You gave Miko to them, didn't you? How did this place get ransacked? You led that K-Officer straight here. You're the only other person who knew about this hideout. You expected me to fly up in the air!? Damn straight! I thought we weren't suppose to cave in to pigs. Will you be satisfied if I had dragged myself down from the air with your wounds on my back!? Enough with your metaphors! Yoko. You were always the best bullshitter. Yoko. Just what was your dream? I wanna hear it! What was your dream!? Yoko. I thought you wanted to take Hibari down and ride the wind all by yourself. The only wind you're blowing is that stench from the red beads you keep inhaling! Say something! Only the small fry are allowed to do anything freely. You're sick, Yoko. You don't even know what you're really after anymore. Move it! You assholes... I kept my end of the deal! Now bring me Miko. Asuka! The beads and cash go first! The girl goes first! The merchandise first! The girl first! If you won't agree, I'll be on my way! What will it be!? I'm ready when you are! Very well. You'll get your stuff once I get back. Safe and sound. Asuka. That wasn't part of the deal! I wouldn't risk putting Yoko or the red beads in danger with you guys. Are you certain about this? Decide, now! Fine. Asuka! If you want Miko, bring me the red beads and money you stole! Yoko! Stop it, Yoko! You'll never be able to escape Lady Hibari's grasp! Give my regards to Toki, in hell. Yoko! Your one-woman show ends now. The flow of Toki's red beads, and the ones that Asuka stole combined will not make up for the hole that you created! Yoko. What do you have to say for yourself? Lady Hibari's hypothesis is as follows. Your dream has always been to dominate the streets. That's why you want to own this place. You wish to overtake her entire organization. To achieve this, you'll need the red beads and money. And that's where you bring in Asuka. She beats our men and Toki, and waits for an opening to seize the K-Officer. Yet, the outcome is still just as you see. Lady Hibari hoped that you'd come to your senses eventually. Because without you, we're unable to produce the amount of red beads we need! You're left with just two options. You can either join Toki to hell, or you can spend the rest of your days decaying in an orchid factory. Lady Hibari! I'll do anything if you'd forgive me! I'm even willing to kill Asuka if you ask me to! Let me do it, I beg of you! That's precisely what Lady Hibari detests about you. Yoko... Why do you insist on killing Asuka so badly? But we won't let your offer go on deaf ears. You can show us proof of your self-proclaimed loyalty, by killing Miko. How about it? She's your sister. Are you willing to kill family!? Red beads nose medicine! Red beads nose medicine! I want some red beads! Gimme some! Red beads nose medicine! Red beads nose medicine... You bitch! No matter how much you try, it won't work. I don't want any of this! I've had enough of your cheap affectionate tricks. Asuka. Do you like Miko? What are you up to? You better not lay a finger on her! Asuka. You still have no idea of what I'm capable of. Yoko came back to me. And guess what she did. Asuka. Miko's dead. Do you understand, Asuka? Yoko did it to make herself stronger. She killed her for that. How could she kill her? How could she kill Miko!? Don't misunderstand, Asuka. Yoko... killed Miko for her own benefit. And for that reason... I've forgiven Yoko. I'm gonna kill Yoko. That little lackey of yours is as good as dead! Ladies and gentlemen. Today, we must bid a sad farewell to Mr. Toki Masamune. We can't help but shed tears for this man when we reminisce of him, he left us too soon, a talented and wise man he was. In addition to our prayers for him, those who came to the farewell ceremony let's swear our best to fight against drugs, in order for his death to not be in vain. We swear! In hindsight, his honesty and sense of responsibility he had for this town, as well as his dedication to integrity and purity, reflected the kind of warm man he was. His heart and soul helped keep these streets safe and its citizens prosperous... Banzai! Banzai! Hey you! Come on buddy, off you go. Let's move it. I said get off! Die! Hold it! Die! And I try, and I try I can't get no I can't get no When I'm watchin' my TV And a man comes on to tell me How white my shirts can be But, he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke The same cigarettes as me I can't get no No, no, no Hey, hey, hey That's what I say And I try, and I try I can't get no Yoko! Show yourself! Yoko. Asuka! Yoko! You little worm! I'll be sure to make it quick, so show yourself! Yoko! What are you so afraid of!? Get your ass out here! Yoko! I'll kill you... Asuka... I'll kill you if you come any closer... Yoko. I won't make this easy for you. It's my turn to kill. Die... Subtitles by GEO9875
