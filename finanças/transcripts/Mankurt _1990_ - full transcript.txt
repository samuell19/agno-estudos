Aitmatov's novel A Day Longer Than a Century Over to the old men! Over with the young! Also over with the young! Those over there with the old men. Those three sitting also over with the old men. Do anything but that! How can one live blind? One can. Mama! Berdi! Kurban! Friends, where are you? Come back, Tannir! Tannir! Son! Leave him be! He can't stand the sight of blood. I'll show you! I'll make a man of you! Spare me! Please! Allah have mercy! It won't hurt. What're you doing? What's the matter, son? Help! What have you got? Drop it! Get up! Carry the stick! This stick is your eyes now. Got me? Still sitting? Get up! You lost your eyes, d'you want to lose your tongue too? Leave the old man alone! Are you inhuman? Put an eternal cap on this one. Don't move or I'll kill you! Who are you? I'm Mergen. Can't we do anything, Yelaman? Bring some water from the river, Tannir. Gozel is ill. Who is Gozel? How do you know I liked her? Because she's the most beautiful of them all. The doctor said she needs rabbit meat. But there's no one to catch one for her. Where does she live? On the outskirts of the village. My head! Does it itch? It will. Be patient. The sun! Take it away! Be patient. It'll save you. Otherwise you'll die and become food for the vultures. One already succumbed and the birds have started in on him. See, they're waiting. Soon your head will stop itching. You won't feel anything. I could have killed you in battle, but I need you alive. I'll make a great Mancourt of you! Soon you'll be dying of thirst and you'll regret that you spit on me. Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Swing... Higher! Swing... The bride is coming! Congratulations, Serdar! This is the happiest day in Aiym's and my life. This sword is yours for bringing good news. The groom must make the camel kneel down. My white camel! Here, son. Drink this punch. May your love be as sweet as??? And your days be bright. Gozel, Yelaman is our only son. Take good care of him! You will be a bride and daughter to me. Greet the guests! We've not always been on the best terms as neighbors. Such a misfortune is about to befall us that we must unite. The enemy is nearby. Their region has become too crowded for them. They're stampeding like a herd of enraged boars. They need land, slaves and cattle. Are they the ones who destroy the captives' memory? Yes. What d'you say, old men? Maybe before they attack we should leave? Leave our homes, our native land? And again set out as beggars carrying packs on our backs? Again the endless wandering? You're right, Niyaz. Cowards run. Men fight. Enough arguing between ourselves. My people are waiting for your answer. Maybe we should go? The earth has no bounds. And a coward has no homeland. You're the oldest, Domnez. You decide. He who runs is overtaken. We didn't start this row. It's a matter of honor. We must defend our land. It's too bad this happy day will be spoiled by bloodshed. I will always be by your side, father. The people must be protected. We'll go to the mountains and live in the caves. Light fires high up. Let our people know in the distant villages. Have the people get ready to set out. Everyone! Get ready to set out. We are about to be attacked. We're going to the mountains. We'll go to the caves. Gather up your things! Tell your families we'll meet in the caves. They've surrounded Yelaman! Father! Water! Water! Don't beat him, father! - What's your name? - Yelaman. - Mancourt! - Yelaman! Yelaman! Will Yelaman really never return? Who knows, daughter... There's no news of him. Where am I? Is anyone here? I am. - Domnez, dear, is that you? - Yes, Aiym. I want to come to you. No, you can't come here. It's terrible for Gozel and I without you and Yelaman. - Where is Yelaman? - He was also killed in battle. Then he should be with me, but he's not here. Search for him among the living. Don't go away, Domnez! Yelaman returned! Where is Yelaman? Yelaman will return. He will. Go down, sun! Go down! Don't torment me! I hate you! Shield me, birds! Save me! You must be able to shoot an arrow while riding a horse. Hold the stones tighter between your knees! Good boys! Now we'll practice shooting! Get ready. Shoot! Don't play such games, Domnez! - Shoot, son! - Don't shoot, Yelaman. Step aside, Mama! - Shoot, son! - Don't shoot, son. Domnez, is it true that Yelaman isn't with you? You aren't just feeling sorry for me, are you? I can't live this way any longer. Yelaman! I lit this fire so you wouldn't get lost. Calm down, daughter. Don't cry. He'll return. Wretched sun! Don't kill me. Damn sun! Go down! Save me, Mama! Don't go away, Mama! Don't leave me. Gozel! Mama! Don't go away, Mama! Get the jug! He's alive! Well, what's your name? - What's your name? - He's a Mancourt now. Everything is all right. All earthly suffering is behind, Mancourt! Gozel! Don't waste your youth. If I don't return in 40 days, know you have my blessing to marry. Why Mama, the fire for Yelaman will never go out. I will wait for him my whole life. This is the talisman of our family. Keep it. It will protect you. Goodbye, daughter. You mustn't go any further. It's dangerous. The invaders often check on their shepards - mancourts. It's better not to ever see one of them. Have mercy, Allah! Not long ago in the ruins of an ancient city. I met one of the shepards. He was a young mancourt. I tried to talk to him. But he doesn't even know his name. He can't remember it. He was tall and handsome. But his eyes were empty and dull. These butchers turn their victims into animals. They break their spirit. And destroy their minds. Even a slave may raise his hand against his master. But never a mancourt... Are you leaving? Thanks, old man. I have to be going. If you exist, Allah, forgive my doubts. If you are all seeing, you must know that I haven't given up hoping. Oh Allah! Just allow me to bury my son! Is that asking too much? And I beg you to make it so that the Mancourt the old man saw is not my son. Then I'll return and live out my life according to your will. Oh Allah! How could I ask such a thing? Let the Mancourt be my Yelaman! Just so he's alive so I could see him once again. Yelaman! My son! I've been searching for you everywhere! Look at me. I'm your mother, Aiym. - Don't you recognise me? - Mother? You're my son. My flesh and blood. I carried you in my womb, I gave you life. Who do you have, if not your mother? A master. That's now. Don't you remember your father. He died fighting the invaders. Remember? Do you remember your name? What's your name? - What's your name? - Mancourt. That's what others have named you. But yours? Yelaman! Hear me, son? Yelaman! Where are you going, son! Wait, talk to me! What have those butchers done to you? Oh Allah! One can take a man's land away from him. One can take away his wealth and his life. But take away a man's memory? How could you give that idea to people? Isn't there enough evil and grief on earth without that? Isn't there? Sit down, son! Let's talk! Don't you remember your bride, Gozel? Oh, my child! When you shouted and struggled, when you waited for mercy from heaven in vain, when you gasped and lost your mind, did you curse Allah at that moment? My child! When the darkness of oblivion closed forever your tortured mind, when your memory, taken by force, lost its grip of the past and you forgot your mother and your wife... didn't you curse your mother as you fell into the abyss of unconsciousness for conceiving you in her womb? Your name is Yelaman! Your father was Domnez-Serdar. He taught you how to shoot a bow and arrow, and to ride a horse. I'm your mother, Aiym. You are my son, Yelaman. Hear me? My dear son! Who d'you want so speak to? To the moon. To the moon? So you remember my story? And me? Are you getting your memory back? A son can't know his mother. You remember your mother, don't you? I'm your mother Aiym. Every night I pray to the moon, and ask for Allah to give my master health and wealth. My son. What d'you want? A hat like my master's. What'd they do to your head? Who is that? My master. Don't tell him about me, I'll return. Allah, you must stop this madness in the world. Otherwise people will turn the earth into a real hell. Grind the grain! He's no longer of any use. Ashir! Berdi, Kurban! Farewell, brothers! Moon, give my master health. Make him wealthy! Do you hear me, moon? Don't go away. Master, the moon is going away! Please stay, moon! I've come, son. I've come. Eat, son... Eat, dear boy, eat... You wore this bell when you were little so as not to get lost, but in battle for luck. I'll tie it on. Have you seen the bow and arrows, Kabbor? I left them here yesterday. Come here, Tannir! Where'd you hide the bow and arrows? - Where are the bow and arrows? - Leave him alone! Find them right now! Why take pity on her? She's the mother of our enemy! She must be killed! Shunar! Take the neighbor's weapons. I'll bring the woman here an kill her. Remember the bell song I used to sing to you? Your mother gave you life, She took your pain to heart, Pining for you, I called you. My son, Yelaman! Your father counted on you. You brought us happiness. I lost my boy, Yelaman, my Yelaman! There are so many misfortunes in the world... I came upon them too - I wash away their traces with my tears of grief. My son, Yelaman. Your native skies are waiting for you. And your beautiful bride. The waterfall in the canyon is waiting for you and the mountains, steppe and spring garden. They're waiting for you, my Yelaman! Why live here, my child? Let's go home! Every evening your wife lights a fire for you. Come here, Akiner! Let's go, son! It's time we went home. Come on! This is your camel. He brought your bride. Get on, son! Remember! You are Yelaman, Domnez's son. And I'm your mother. I'll come for you. Who was that woman? Who! What did she say? She was my mother. You don't have a mother! Why'd she come? This is why. She wanted to see your head. Was she with you last night? At night the moon went away. Where to? It didn't go away, that woman stole it. Come here! Now! Find it and bring it here! Stamp on it! Throw up the hat for him! He's lost his memory but his hands remember everything. We must find the woman. Get down, Tannir! You'll fall. There she is! Papa, Tannir fell! Tannir is hurt! How? Where? My son, what have they done to you? Did they kill you? Yelaman! Son! I'm your mother. You are my son. Remember your father. Remember your name. Remember your homeland. Remember, remember, remember...
