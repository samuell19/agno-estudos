The heart that's meant to love you will fight for you when you start to give up. Lift you up when you're feelin' down. And loan you their smile when it's hard for you to find your own. And will never get their strength from seein' you weak, power from seein' you hurt, or joy from seein' you cry. The heart that's meant to love you wants to see the best of you, not to hurt you. And you should never forget this. I wish I was a little girl again. 'Cause skinned knees are easier to fix than a broken heart. Ooh, what's up? Good morning. - How you doin'? - Good morning, baby. You're up early, in a good mood. Yes, 'cause I got that email and it put me in good spirits. Really? Yes. And, according to my bank account, we about to do some celebrating girl. So, they're makin' the investment? Yes, they're makin' the investment! And they're not only gonna fund this project, but they gonna fund my next three to five, as well. Oh, well, well, well, Mr. Dollar Singer. Looks like somebody needs to be practicing their autograph stroke. Oh, girl, come on, now. I already got a stroke that's been mastered. Come on, now. There's no practice needed with that one. No. Maybe later, okay? Come on, now. Let's just eat. Come on. And, plus, you know I gotta be on set in a couple hours. Mm, okay. Mm. Hm. Hey, Jason. What's up? Oh, you know I'm ready. And I have all my lines together. You just make sure you're ready. Okay? Boy, stop. Okay. Bye. Bye. Okay. Almost there. Okay. And... Oh my gosh! I love it! Come on, let's go. This is noice. Yes. Um. Look, uh, we been together for three years now. And I can't imagine- - Yes, yes, yes, yes. With anybody but you. - Yes, yes, yes. - Yes. Yes, baby. Mm. Cut. That was beautiful, guys. All right, let's reset. Back to one. Can I take a five? Take five. I'll just. Um. Whoa. Babe, babe, babe, wait, hey. Hey, hey, I'm sorry. Okay? Jason, what the hell was that? You was completely outta line and unprofessional. Look, you know how I feel about you, V, okay? Like, the moment just, it just got the best of me. - Jason. - Hm? We're on a professional set. You gotta learn how to control yourself. And you know I got a man. I know you do. I know you got a man. I never meant to disrespect your relationship, okay? Thank you. So. Wanna rehearse again? The proper way this time. Okay. But, no double kissin' and don't be touchin' my ass like that. Why do I have to keep tellin' this man how he's supposed to behave on set? Hell, he on his way to becomin' a big time movie star. He should know better. God, I just need a big break. Hey, baby. What's up? How was your day? Mwah! Ooh, yo, gimme them feet. Yo, I had an amazing day. I had some meetings and I had to finalize some paperwork. And, tomorrow, I gotta meet with the lawyer. 'Cause you know I ain't about to sign shit without gettin' his okay first. Mm hm. But, uh, how was your day? Oh, you know. Rehearsin'. I'm just so ready to shoot this film. Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you. Jason Desmond is in this film. Oh yeah. Yo, that man is in some big stuff, yo. Yes. This is a big deal. I'm so proud o' you. Thank you, babe. Oo, oo, girl. Mwah. You start rehearsin' next week? Yes, yes. I guess. Oh my gosh, I'm so excited, like, babe. This is gonna be my big break. Like, oh my gosh. I can't wait. I'll be right back. I'll be right back, okay? Mwah. All right, all right, makin' that face, girl. You know I love your feet. I wonder if I should tell Corey about Jason unprofessional behavior on set. Nah. Corey might show up and beat his ass. I'll just keep it to myself. Plus, he said it was sorry. Can't have Corey fuckin' up my big opportunity. Here. Let's make a toast. All right? This is to us being on our way and, uh, it's only up from here. Hello? This is she. How can I help you? No, no, no, no, no, no. I thought I gave you guys plenty of notice. Babe, who is that? Bam, my wedding is in two weeks. Who is that? Do whatever it takes. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I really appreciate that. Hm? Babe. That was the dress designer. She said my dress might not be ready in two weeks, because some of the fabrics is shippin' late. I gave these guys plenty of notice to get my shit together- - Babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, babe, no, no, no, no, no. It's okay. All right? It's all right. It's your special day. No tears. Hm? I'm pretty sure God will make a way for that dress designer to have that dress done in time. But, it's easy for you to say. You're not the one taking care of all the caterin', the full, like, the venue. - Everything. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, You're not helpin' wit' any- - Baby, baby, baby, baby. Wait, okay? Calm down. Don't direct that anger to me. The dress designer's the one who messed up. Okay? Now, look, just come over here and let me transfer some of these positive vibes into you. Come on. Give me a big old hug. Okay. Cut. The both of you area amazing. I love the chemistry between you two. Thank you. All right, let's set up for the next scene. Um, can I talk to you? Okay. Over here? Okay. What's the matter? Um. What was that about? What are you talking about? The whole deep breathin' on my neck, your hand risin' to my butt? Like, that wasn't in the script. I was just playin' into the scene. Directors love that shit. Yeah, but that wasn't in the script. Can you please just stick to the script? That felt too real. Well, that's great. That means you're tapped in. I hope you don't think I was tryin' to come onto you again. Look, I'm not trying to offend you, I was just playing it to the scene, like I said. People do it on set all the time. Improvising. When you do these things, you gotta make it feel as real as possible. If that was my fiance, that's exactly what I would do, okay? Remember, the director loved it. And, her next film is going to cable. Um, okay. I guess, if the director loved it. You killed it by the way. Be calm, Valentine. Don't cuss him completely out. I see how you tryin' to run game like I'm a newbie or somethin'. Like I never acted and tapped into a character before. He was breathing too heavy with them kisses for me. But let me keep calm. Come on, girl. You got this. I knew I wasn't trippin'. Jason is completely out of line and very disrespectful on set. I can't believe he tried to throw it on me. Like, "Just because I have feelings for you Valentine doesn't mean everything I do is comin' onto you." But he was comin' onto me. Valentine. Valentine. Yo, my bad, yo. You didn't hear me callin' your name? No, I was in deep thought. Well, is everything okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Just stressin' about this movie. You need anything? No, I'm fine, babe. Are you hungry, baby? No, I'm not hungry. But, I'll come in in a coupla minutes. All right. Get out your feelings, girl, and do what you gotta do to get this movie done. It can open many doors for you. I should tell Corey. Or ask him what I should do in this situation. Lord knows, I need this film, but, at what price? I just don't know what to do. You ready to tell me what was wrong? How'd you know somethin's wrong with me? It's my job to know my woman. Hm. Okay. Well. I'm feelin' uncomfortable on set. Uncomfortable how? My scene partner. He's bein' very inappropriate. How? When he kiss me, his tongue is down my throat. And, when he hugs me, his hands go too far down and he grabs my butt and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm not gonna tell him that Jason whispers to me that I was beautiful when he was feelin' me. Corey would go apes hit if he knew the whole truth. Have you talked to him about this? Yes, I talked to him about it. And he say, it's just to make the scene real. Oh, okay. Well, I mean, that's okay, I understand that. I mean. Hey, you gotta make sure that the audience feels the chemistry and, uh, you know. Every great film has to have great acting. I mean, is he apologetic? He's always apologetic. He say he's not tryin' to make me feel uncomfortable, but then he'll do somethin' else inappropriate. Well, I'll tell you one thing. He better keep his fuckin' tongue out your mouth if he wants to swallow. And he better not never touch my booty. Girl, I will chop them hands off. Here, let me tell 'em. No. No, no, No, you're not. Okay? You know they already look at women like we're emotional. I can't have my man comin' on set, speakin' for me. Plus, this is my big break, babe. I don't need anything jeopardizing that. And, if you love me, you just give me advice and let me handle it. If I need you, I'll let you know so you can come kick his ass. All right, well. I understand, but, babe. You know this is why I didn't want you to become an actress. You know how jealous I get. I can't stand to see no other man to put his hands on my woman. I don't care if it's fake, aight? Okay, you know you can just quit, right? I can take care of you and, maybe you can be a housewife? And we can finally get this family started. Ain't that just like a man? To think all a woman is good for is keepin' the house clean and bearin' children. Housewife? Well, baby, you know I love acting. It's always been my dream. And, please, let's not have that family discussion right now. Okay, well, if I can't talk to him, you've already talked to him, just talk to the director if he keeps it up, all right? That's a great idea, babe. Great idea. All right, well. I'm gonna go to bed, because I do not feel well right now. Okay. Reception said there's a patient in need of special attention. You need a nurse? Nurse. What's your name, baby? Does it matter? No. Ooh, hold up, though, baby. Mm. Come on, come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah, keep that eye line. Yo, babe, keep your eye line tight with your subjects, all right? Just like that. Yeah. Hey, wait, wait, V. Keep your posture upright and aligned, right? You know where the camera is, right? All right. Yeah, baby, gimme that light. That light. Turn to the right. No, no, wait. Baby, babe. Dropped my pillow on the ground. Can you get my pillow? No, girl, girl, turn to the left. Lemme see that. Yeah, there we go. What you doin'? Good, good, bring your chin down. Yes. So bend down a little bit. Sexy, sexy, sexy, yes, girl, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout, baby! Damn, babe. You look good, girl. Ay, yi, no, no, no. Lean down, shake a little bit. Shake 'em a little bit. Shake 'em around. Shake the drugs around a little bit. Yes, girl. Now, open your elbows up. Man, fuck this. You know how to ruin the mood. You, where you goin'? Nurse! Where that button? Nurse! Corey. Hm? Get up, baby. Just, like, five more minutes. No. Get up. You know five minutes turn to three hours. You don't wanna be late. Get up. All right, all right, all right. What time is your rehearsal at, baby? 2 o'clock. Okay. All right. Call me when you wake up, all right? Okay. Oh. Hey, what's up, Darnell? Hey, man, what's up with this last scene, bro? You know we got this deadline approaching soon and I got a lot ridin' on this. All right. Hey, well, uh, write a cliffhanger. 'Cause I found some funds for a sequel. Ayy, all right. And- Okay. Yeah, I'm headin' to a potential location right now. All right. Yeah, I'll get in touch with you tonight. All right. Oh. Hey, what's up, girl? How you doin'? I thought you were sleepin' in today. I'm up early. I gotta go through my lines before rehearsal today. Hey, Valentine, you sure you're okay with this whole superstar man? I know you said you'd handle it, but I'm just double checkin' wit' you. Oh. I'm fine. Not finna let no one get in the way of my goals. But, thank you, anyways. You're welcome. I just called to say I love you. I love you more. Okay. I gotta go. Bye. I love you. I'm so sick of this shit. When I was in the holding area, he whispered in my ear, "Damn, you lookin' good in them jeans." I have had just about enough of his ass. So, I guess this is the hard part. No, it's not hard. You've just been tryin' to invite friends that you haven't talked to in awhile. So, come on, baby. You can cut that list down. Like who? What about Q? What about Q? That's like my brother. Yeah, but, he- - We talk all the time. Like, every day. Okay. You know I can't stand his ass, right? Always tryin' to get you to go to the strip club with all the hoes. Hoes? Yeah. Baby. Baby, we do not go with hoes. Or to "strip clubs", okay? We go to bible study. Bible study? Who else? And he's actually gonna be one of my groomsmen. He who? Q. - Negative. - What? He will not be standin' up there with me. Come on. Babe! Come on! Cut. Valentine, are you okay? I'm sorry. Um, yeah, I just forgot my lines. Can I take a ten, please? Take ten. Can I talk to you? What's the problem? Hold your shit together, V. Don't be the emotional black woman. You're on set. You're on set. Don't ruin your opportunity to work with this director again. Remain professional. Sick of your shit. I'm not gonna keep tellin' you to back the fuck off me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Where's all this aggression coming from? Are you fu-? Earlier? You whisperin' in my ear, talkin' about, "Oh you look good in them jeans." You should actually be honored that somebody of my caliber is interested in you. Oh, what? Do you know who I am? I'm Jason Desmond. If you played your cards right, you could be exactly where I am. I can tell either you don't care about your career or you don't know how this industry works. Oh, I get it. So, because you're Jason Desmond, I'm supposed to drop my panties and fuck you? You know what? It is pointless talking to you. I'm going to the director on you. Oh, so you want to get fired? Why the fuck would I get fired? You're the one sexually harassing me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, don't even. Don't say that. Don't even play like that. That's not what's goin' on here. I've just been tryin' to help you get your career to the next level. Well, let me tell you somethin', if I can't make it in this industry with my great actin' skills, then fuck acting. Wait. You actually think you're a great actress? That's why I thought you wanted my help. Breathe, V. Don't give into this situation. You can do it. Fuck you, Desmond! Fuck you! And stay the fuck away from me! Is everything all right over here? Everything is okay, Diana. Okay. All right, it better be. 'Bout to roll. Pitcher's up. Get ready. Sorry. Hey, baby. How you doin'? Oh my gosh, you're not gonna believe what happened today. Today was so crazy on set. Corey. Corey. Hey, hey. Hold up one second, okay? I'm almost done. Oh. Hey, Mr. Steinbeck. How you doin', sir? I'm well, Mr. Miller. Everything's fine on my end. How's the missus? Valentine is doin' well. She's rehearsin' for a breakthrough role. You know, I say she's in good spirits. Looks like a power couple in the making. Hey, I received that. I hope so. Give me some good news. How's the script comin' along? Uh, well. I'll tell ya right now, we are almost there. Darnell is just makin' a couple revisions right now. You know we're lookin' at a hard deadline here? No more room for extensions. I am fully aware. Very well. Send the missus my best regards. I'll be in touch. All right, sir. And, uh, yo, thank you again, Mr. Steinbeck. Dammit, Darnell. I'm up against a big deadline, baby. Oh, so you're just gonna have an attitude? You do realize that I was over there working, right? I'm so sick of coming last in your life. You do not come last, okay? Yes I do. You always on the phone. And when you're not on the phone, you're writing. When you're not writing, filming's the first thing you think about in the mornin' and the last thing you think about at night. You don't have any more room for me. V. Do I say anything to you when you're rehearsing day and night with your male scene partner? No. 'Cause it's work, right? It's only a problem when I'm workin'? But I make time for you. I even make you feel comfortable with my scene partner. I have invited you to the practice, but you never find time to come. Babe. I'm working my ass off. For us. Everyday. How you think I got to where I am? I'm almost there, V. Just hang in there. 'Kay? We are on our way, baby. But you still have to make time for the people you love. I do make time. I make time. You know, I ain't got time for this. Because when I make time, it goes to shit. So, fuck it. Good mornin'. Good mornin', baby. I'm about to go out to the store and get somethin' to cook for dinner. You know I hate when we fight, right? Ah, you know, that wasn't a fight. That was just a little spat. A little spat? What you gonna get? You'll see when I come back. Ooh. Mm, mm, mm. Hey. Let me take those, girl. What you got? What you get? Well, you know. I got your favorite. You got blueberry waffles, eggs, hashbrowns and sweet tea? And don't forget about the turkey bacon. Ooh girl! Jason. Is everything okay? Yeah. What do you mean? Why do you ask? I ask, because I'm the director. This is a big opportunity for us all. And my job is to make sure that everything is fine. All right, what's up? Hm? What's going on? Everything okay? Jason, um. He hasn't stopped. In fact, it's gettin' worse. And a little outta hand and weird. Right. Yeah. Sorry, I don't understand. You and V. Your chemistry has been a little off lately. It's like you two are disjointed. All right. Fuck this. Give me your cell phone, I'm about to give him a call right now. No. Baby, you said you was gonna keep it cool. Yeah, I know, but this has gone on for far too long. All right? And it's time for this to come to an end. Give me your phone please. Nah, it's just. I don't know, it's just nerves. Maybe anxiety. Listen, Jason. I'm the director. You can come to me with any concerns. Because you know I'm not gonna let anything or anyone disrupt the outcome of this film. I got too much ridin' on this. Then what should I do? I mean, have you had to deal with somethin' like this on your set? All the time. More than you think. Listen, what's the director's name? Her name is Dana. Dana Davis? Yeah, that's her. Cool. 'Cause I recently went to a seminar with her. I'm just gonna shoot her an email- - No, no, no, no, no. What are you doin'? No, no, Corey, no. You can't go embarrass me like that. You're gonna cause more issues than there is. This is my big opportunity, babe. Right, um. You wanna sit down for this? No. Let's walk. Okay. It's Valentine. I think she's starting to have feelings for me. Okay. Embarrass you? You gonna tell me some guy over here hittin' on you and I'm embarssin' you? In some weird way, I'm embarassin' you? For confrontin' this jerk? No, no, no, no, babe. I just don't want anything to cost me this role, babe. We're beyond a fuckin' role at this point. We're at damn near pressin' charges point, yo. No, we're not, Corey. I got this. Feelings? Like, what types of feelings, Jason? Sexual feelings. And I think it's startin' to affect her performance. And how does that make you feel? 'Cause I'm sure it's affecting your performance, as well. Well, I'm a talented actor with a bright future and I can handle it. For the most part. But, I will admit that it's startin' to distract. They already lookin' at me as the angry black woman. The angry black woman? Yeah, I was just fed up with all this shit that's been happening. And then the director came over... Well, good, did you talk to her and tell her what's goin' on? No. Why? I need to give her a call. This is completely unacceptable. No, no, no, no, no. You don't need to do that. I 'll talk to here one more time. All right? She's new to the craft and she is talented. You know, she just needs to understand the value of professionalism on set. Babe, I just want to film. That's it. This is my big opportunity and I have the leadin' role. V. At what cost? Okay? When is enough going to be enough? Are you sure? Well, yeah. 'Cause I'm not going to tolerate another lackluster performance on my set between you or her. Get y'all's shit together. Jason. I'm serious. Production starts in two weeks. Get it together. And I mean it. You can trust me. I got it. Um, I will go to the director, okay? You hear me? Yeah, I hear you. I will go to the director. Not my big-time director boyfriend, okay? I got this. Let me handle it. So, promise me. You're not gonna get involved? Yeah, I promise. Thank you, babe. Mm hm. Love you. Love you. I'ma handle it all right. This is my girl. She better take care of this, too. Try to tell me. Babe, it came! What's that? Oh, my dress, look! Oh, okay. Yes! Okay. Gettin' a little closer to our wedding day. Yes. You gettin' cold feet? Of course not. Do I look like I'm gettin' cold feet? No. Okay, then. Babe. Hm? You mean the world to me. Oh, do I? Yes, you do. And I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with you. Mm, well you know I feel the exact same way about you. Well, you better. And our wedding day is in two weeks. Uh huh. You sent out all the invites? I sure did. We all set, babe. That's my girl. Mm. Cut. What the hell was that? Jason and Valentine, come with me. Crew, give me five, please. Shit, V, this can't be good. I think it's time to lay it all out there. I can't believe this is happening. I'm not gonna let this asshole ruin my big break. I don't know what the hell is going on between the both of you, but you have five minutes to explain. Everything's fine. Really? I received an email from your significant other stating otherwise. Meanwhile, Jason tells me here that you've been, uh, harassing him throughout this entire production? - Really? - Yes. And, honestly, it's starting to affect my performance. What the fuck is goin' on here? Valentine, please watch your language. You see? She's havin' a hard time controlling herself. Don't be the angry black woman that they want you to be. And that you have every right to be in this situation, V. I can't believe this lyin' piece of shit. And did this bitch just say my man sent her an email? Keep it together, V. Keep it together. You got this, girl. Hello? Valentine. What do you have to say for yourself? You lyin' piece of shit. Can we please all just talk like respectable adults? This is the- - Shut the fuck up! Let me tell you what's really goin' on here. Jason? Has been makin' plenty advances towards me. And it's makin' me extremely uncomfortable. Every time he tries to kiss me, he wants to put his tongue down my mouth. And then when he hugs me, his hands go a little too low where they're supposed to go, makin' me feel very uncomfortable. And, yes, I do reject his advances. Can I tell you what I see? I see you leaning into Jason, taking him off-set when we cut, away from everyone? What I also see is that you've been a little irritable and you're taking it out on the cast. And I'm glad someone else sees this. I only pull him to the side just to tell him to stop. You know what? If someone was sexually making advances towards me, I would not wanna be alone with them. That's just me, I'm sayin'. If I'm harassing him, then why does he come with me? Huh? You know what? It seems like you believe what he told you, but, why aren't you aiming your comments towards the both of us? I am. Oh, I am. We've had a private conversation about this situation. Then why the fuck are you talkin' to me in front of him? I feel like I'm being ganged up on. Please. Do not feel like that. Here's what I can do for you. I'm going to open up an investigation, check into everything. Until then, you can stay at home. What? I can stay home? Yes, I don't need the both of you on my set. Hold up. What the fuck is going on? We're filmin' in two days, like? What are you saying? I'm saying when I complete my investigation, and when we're about to shoot, I do have an understudy. I can swap out the main character. So I'm fired? I didn't say that. Well, basically, that's what you sayin'. We have to get back on set. I'll talk to you very soon. Pitcher up. Jason. Bitch. You really shoulda took that advice I offered you. Fuck you. This industry is very small. You're done. Get the fuck away from me. Good luck, though! Fuck. Oh my God. Hey, Mr. Steinbeck, is everything okay? I was just about to come into the office. Take a walk with me. Hey. Thought I read the script. Okay. Took you a little longer than expected. You almost blew the deal. You know how much money is banked on this movie. Yes, sir, and I apologize if I put the company in any jeopardy, okay? Oh, you did. Fortunately, they loved it. - Really? - Yeah. Mr. Director. Oh, so wait, I got the job? You got the job. They're relocatin' you in two weeks. To LA. LA? Yeah, Los Angeles. They got a lot of things planned for you out there. All your hard work's payin' off, man. So, I'm movin' to LA in two weeks? Yes. I mean, I know it's a bit short notice, but, company. We're gonna pay for your travel expenses, we're gonna put you up in a hotel for a month. That should be plenty of time for you to find you a place to live. Yes. - Yes, it is. - Sir. Yes it is. Yo, thank you so much, Mr. Steinbeck. Hey, we're gonna miss havin' such a hard worker on the team. You keep it up. Ah, man. Woo! Thank you. Thank you, yo, we did it. Oh, I need to go to work. Hey, babe. Hey. I'm up here. Hey, babe, guess what? Did you contact the director behind my back? Yes, I did. And I'm sorry. But, guess what? You said it all nonchalant, like, "Oh yes, I did. I mean, I'm sorry." Like it's no big deal. Yeah, 'cause it's not a big deal, okay? Come on now. 'Kay? I just did what I was supposed to do as your man. And I stick up for my woman. What you just think I can't handle things on my own? No. No, no, no. It's not that you can't handle 'em on your own. You just was wishin' it would stop, that's all. But you promised me you wasn't gonna do anything. You lied. I had to. Okay, V? It was either do that or go to the police and press charges? Now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I lied. But I was just tryin' to protect you. But I can protect myself, Corey. I been doin' it for a while now. And I got your back. Well, I got fired. Wha-? Let me not say fired. They said they're "doing an investigation". What? Yeah, Jason. He went to the director first sayin' I'm the one harassing him. All right, well, since it was addressed, 'cause I'm about to go kick his ass right now. What? No. Well then I'm about to call my lawyer and I'm gonna sue the shit out of him. I'm not some damsel in distress. I'm capable of handlin' this on my own. I'm just gonna wait 'til the investigation is over. Oh, babe. You know what? You shoulda just let me handle this from the beginning and none of this shit woulda happened. You shoulda just listened to me. Now I gotta try to save what little career you have left. What you mean by what little career that I have left? Huh? You don't play around with stuff like this, V. Now, look. You're not the first woman that this has happened to. And you're damn sure not gonna be the last. Okay? You have to report stuff like this immediately. Now, he's still workin', right? Yeah. Okay, then. Let me handle it. Damn, girl, you so hardheaded. Shoulda just listened to me. Hardheaded? That's some shit you say to a child. I'm not no chile. You're not a child, V. But this is what I do. This is my world. This is our world. Girl, you only been actin' for a year now. What are you talkin' about? You know what? No, no, no. I'm not about to argue with you, V. I'm not about to argue with you. I'm about to call my lawyer. No. I told you I was gonna handle it, so let me proceed how I was gonna do it. Mind your fuckin' business, Corey. Okay. Okay. I'ma let you handle this how you see fit. And we gonna see how far that gets you. Dear God, thank you so much for this promotion. Thank you so much for this increase of income. Thank you so much for everything that you've done for me, Lord. Are you moving me away from the situation with Valentine? I just need some type of clarity, some type of direction, that's best for me, Lord. Is this woman meant to be my wife or my lesson? I just need some type of guidance. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen. What are you doin'? I'm goin' to bed. Oh, I see that, but why are you in the bed? Because I've been doin' this for the last two years. Oh, so a smart man like you that's been doin' this for two years and you still don't know how this proceeds? V. I am not tryin' to argue wit' you right now. Can you please just get in the bed? Oh, I'm goin' to bed, but you 'bout to hit that couch. I paid for this damn bed! What? Goin' to the couch. That's what I thought. Now, you can go to bed. Mm. I'll go to sleep. Damn blanket with me, too. Fuck you, Corey. Baby, we can make that happen now, come on. Fuck you! Take your covers! Mornin', V. Why you up so early? Um. I was thinking. You were right. About what? I should've listened to you. But. You was wrong going behind my back, contacting the director. All right. I was wrong, all right? - I lied to you. - Mm hm. And I shouldn't have gone behind your back. And, I was wrong. Okay? Okay. But you know how you can make it up to me? Put me in your movie? V, I'm not the casting director, babe. Just the director. Just the director, but, you can put me in your movie. People do it all the time. Come on, babe. I'm gonna be late, babe. I gotta get dressed. Hello. Come in. Sorry to just drop in unannounced. It's okay. I was a little worried about the investigation, anyways. That's why I'm here. Okay. Mm hm. So, this conversation is off the record. Okay. I believe you. Vindication. I know you haven't been acting long, but if something like this ever happens again, say something. Okay, I will. Yes. It's happened to me before and I just want you to know you're not in it alone. Oh my God. This is a male-dominated industry, and us women, we need to stick together. We sure do. Yes, we have to root for each other, we have to look out for each other. Had I known he was doing this to you, I would have stepped in. I would've helped. I appreciate you. Thank you so much. You're welcome. So, I talked to the writers, producers, and executive producers and they thought it would be best that you not return to set. What? We're goin' with your understudy. Then what was all that shit about you, us women, stickin' together and you helpin' me? I did help you. But Jason said it's you or him. They went with him. Because he's a major talent, larger fan base, more connections. No charges will be filed against you. Charges? Hold up. Charges against me? Did you tell 'em all that bullshit that you believe me? No. But I did make it a personal note to tell you. I'm a mom. A single mother. And I'm not gonna let my job be jeopardized. I need to get the money. And, like I said, this is a male-dominated industry. And I'm not gonna let my voice be silenced. But when it's just me, it's not powerful. I understand. I don't want you jeopardize' your job for little ol' me. But I can say this. On another production, another set, I'll be contacting you. Now, it may not be a major network. But it's gonna be in my film. A role. Specifically for you. Okay. I look forward to that phone call. I hope so. What's up, baby? How was your day? Hm. That's what the glass of wine's for? Yep. Right. Well, I was tryin' to tell you somethin' the other day. Guess what? I was thinkin'. 'Bout what we talked about this mornin'? What was we talkin' about this mornin'? You put me in your movie? I told you, I'm not the castin' director. So what is different this time, Mr. Director? You can just tell 'em to put me in your film and the casting director will cast me in? That's not proper protocol. So what? You're my man. Okay, so let me get this straight. Because you're my girl, I'm just supposed to put you in my film like that? Man. Jason's rubbin' off on you, huh? So why would you say some shit like that? You tryin' to do to me what he did to you. Sleep your way to the top. What? Ha. What the fuck you just say? Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say that. Yeah, you sorry. Look, babe, look. Come on, man. Let's have a seat, come on. Let's have a seat 'cause we need to talk. Mm hm. Come on, let's talk. Come here. So Mr. Steinbeck called me. And I got the job. That's great, babe. Oh my gosh. I'm so proud of you. Thank you. It's in LA. So we're movin' to LA. Oh my gosh, that will take my career to the next level. I'm so excited. Oh. Baby? What's wrong? I think I should move to LA by myself. Okay. You know. I'll just hold it down here. What, you gonna be filming for what, like, six months or so? I'm moving to LA alone. So what are you saying, Corey? I, uh. I think that we have been movin' in different directions in our life, and, I mean we haven't been on the same page for a minute now. All right, V? We should save ourselves a lot of heartache and end it now. So. So, you don't love me anymore? No, yes, baby, I do. It's not like that. I just. We just. We should just move on. So is it someone else? No, baby, it's not like that. This was not an easy decision for me to make, okay? I been prayin' on this. My heart hasn't been in this for a minute. Okay? I just gotta focus on myself. So, you just kick me while I'm down, huh? No, no, no, no, no. It's not like that. But it is like that, Corey. It is. You tell me to follow my dream, quit my job, and now my career's up in flames and I don't have no job. I have nothing. Why are you doing this to me, Corey? I'm not tryin' to do you like nothin', okay? You can have everything in this house. Okay? I'll pay the rent for the next two months. Why the next two months, huh? Why not? Your name is on the lease, Corey. Well, I talked to the landlord and they said that's how long it would take for my name to get off the lease. Oh. Okay. So, Mr. Corey got it all figured out, huh? So, now you just gonna, what? Checkin' off your little list. Now your list is to blindside your woman? And break her heart? Well, you have. So you can finish checkin' your list off and take your ass to LA. Babe, I don't leave for a whole 'nother week. You don't leave for LA for another week, but you're leavin' out this house today. The fuck now! Get your ass up out my house. Leave! Okay. All right. I'ma get some clothes. And make sure you take it all. I don't ever wanna see your face again. How much time do you need? You remember when I won this for you at the fair? How much time do you need, Corey? Just a couple more minutes. I'ma send my brother for the things that I mighta missed. Okay? No need. I'm gon' throw all that shit away. I don't want no memories of you. V. You don't gotta be so cold-blooded, okay? I still love you. I'm still in love with you. Cold-blooded. Like you are to me? Huh? V, I- I'm not tryin' to argue right now. Okay? Can I please just get a hug and a kiss? A hug and a kiss? Hell no. Leave my motherfuckin' keys on the counter and get the fuck outta my house. What you waitin' on? Give it here! I'll call you when I get to my mom's. No need. I'm changin' my number anyways. Damn. What? You thought we was gonna be friends? A friend wouldn't do me like that. You said you wanted to move on? Then move on. Bye. The heart that's meant to love you will fight for you when you start to give up. Lift you up when you're feelin' down. And will loan you their smile when it's hard for you to find your own. It will never get the strength from seein' you weak. Power from seein' you hurt. Or joy from seein' you cry. The heart that's meant to love you wants to see the best of you. Not to hurt you. And you should never forget this. Hello? Valentine, how are you? Oh, I'm tired. I just got offa work. Long day on set, huh? I wish. No, I actually work the graveyard at the Herrod and Son plant. Really? Yeah, word got around about Jason, and. You know the actin' community's real small. I can't book for shit. That really ruined me. Damn. I'm sorry to hear that. Yeah. That's life. Well, I have some good news that may change your fortune. Good news? You remember when I said I'll call you when something comes up? Yeah. I remember. Well, something came up and this is that call. Really? Oh my gosh. I really appreciate that. What's your availability like next week? I'd like to meet somewhere to get you caught up to speed. I'm free anytime. But what about your job? Hold on for a second. Hello? This is Valentine. I quit. And it turned out, I was in, and it turned out great. Right. - Mother fucker- - No, people do that all the time. No, people do that all the time. Jesus. You know, people do this all the time. Don't judge me. Does it go on my body or on my shirt? What I'm saying is. I'm saying that when the investivay- Pfft. I'm saying when I complete the investigation. What's the line? Line? Damn. Remember the director loved it. See. The, the shit. It's there. It's right there. Right there in my head. Just gotta come out my mouth. You ain't hear me callin' your name? Damn. No, I was in deep throat. Everything okay? Yeah. Why don't you go again? Sound like you said you was in deep throat, girl. You better say your line right. I said thought. Thought? I'm up against a- Damn! The glasses first.
