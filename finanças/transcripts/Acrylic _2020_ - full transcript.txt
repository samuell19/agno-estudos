There's just something about the sunny blue sky in this town that makes them shine. The power, the draw, the expression. The enchantment of a woman's hands when they are well taken care of. It really is hard to resist the way nails feel when gently grazed against your skin. The way a perfectly primp set of toes looks in the right pair of heels. I've always loved it. I had a teacher in school who always tapped her nails on things when she was trying to make a point. I would watch her run her long acrylic french tips through her hair as she put it in a bun. Some might say I had a crush on her, but really I was completely entranced by her hands. It was as if she was conducting a symphony, and her fingers played the role of the baton. I would eagerly await the holidays, because she would switch to a deep red that looked like fresh blood, perfectly painted on her fingertips. No doubt, my passion for nail care began during that time. I knew the possibilities were endless then, and the nail world still never ceases to amaze me. - The phone ringing off the hook! When are we getting help? - Mimi, I have a new person starting today. - This bitch better not be shady like last bitch. - So, tell me about yourself. - Being completely honest with you, I absolutely hate that question, because I can honestly take it a million different ways. So let's just cut to the chase, I watch your space, and I have a lot of clients. So you don't have to worry about having to fill the books, or anything, 'cause I have my own clients, I'm gonna bring 'em all over. Now, I am really busy, so I'm only gonna need the chair about like maybe two days a week. Like maybe like a random Wednesday, and then like the last Sunday of the month, or something like that, I don't know. - Interesting. And what's your name again? - Oh, Annita. - Annita. - With two Ns. - We have a interesting group, and I actually think you'll fit right in. When do you wanna start? - Oh, yikes. Let's see, I have the restaurant, on Wednesday I have the water aerobics. How about, honestly? Screw it, let's just do tomorrow. Does tomorrow work? I could do tomorrow. - Okay, and you do know the rate? - Yeah, it's-- - It's 200 a day. - Yeah, that's what I read. Yeah, that's fine. - I will probably need you to give me that in cash, is that okay? - Cash, yeah. In advance. Before you move in. - You got it. I got that. - Okay. Well, I think you will fit right in. Welcome. - Oh, thank you so much. - She stole our tip. - There won't be any issues. - Good day to you, feminine creatures of the divine. What do you need today, Boo? - Besides getting my fingers on the fly? I'm the kind of guy that's looking for a goddess from the sky. And yo miss Mo, if I might say, you're looking mighty fine. Boy, sit down. Mani/pedi? Pick a color. - No actually, I'm here for work. My name's Amethyst, I'm the new receptionist. - Amethyst, welcome. Come on back, I'll get you started. Hi, this is Sam. Leave your name and number, and I'll get. - Mom, I'm here! Hey. Wake up, Sam. Mom, how long is this gonna be your routine? Come on, it's been weeks. I think you should talk to someone. In fact, you have an appointment today at noon. Come on, get dressed. - Thank you so much for this opportunity. - Do the girls make you nervous? I mean, there are some strong personalities out there. We've just been through a lot, and the last girl, she was just full of some real shady shit. - I mean, I wouldn't really say nervous. I am an anxious person, and it takes me a moment to warm up, until I'm on, and at work, I'm on. I really do enjoy working with people, and being in a place that makes people feel beautiful and accepted for who they are is just for me. And girl, I am all about my glam jam. - Well, based on your resume, which I looked over very thoroughly, and our phone conversation, you seem like the right piece to our puzzle. I just wanna know, can you handle the pace? And the drama? Monique is hands down the best nail tech here. Girl takes her work seriously. She's been here the longest and tends to keep things in check when I'm not around. Now Mimi, she's pretty nuts. It don't take much to set her off. Honestly, if she weren't such a loyal, hardworking human that I love sort of like a daughter, I'd have her ass deported. Kelly who you met, she might seem like a hard ass, but she cares deeply about this place and our family. You should check her out on the turntables. - Yo, my feed is blowing up right now about this! Check it out! - Excuse me? Whatever happened to knocking? What's got you so worked up, girl? - Well, I got booked a DJ at this upscale fashion event, and it turns out that Elite LA is gonna be in the hood looking for the top nail salons to feature in their upcoming issue! - Kelly, we've been in LA Elite before. - I know, that's not all. I wanted to know more, so I copped the last issue and found out it's a contest, and the winner gets 50K. Linda, I seriously think that we could take this! You know we have the best talent in the area, and you know we could use that 50 Gs. - Well, you're right, we could use a little facelift, and a holiday bonus would be great. This has to be legit. - Oh my god, okay. We've got to get started on this. Don't worry, I'll DM the magazine, I'll set it all up. OMG, we're gonna kill it! - You know, she's right. We don't have a lot of competition in the area, we could really do this. - Let's win some money, mama. - I really want to commend you for coming here today. I know how difficult it is to walk in that door, sit down, and bare your soul. I do. - My daughter did this. I'm wondering how old your kid has to be before it's too old to ground her. - Your daughter seems to be a wonderful young women. I know she really cares about you. Is there anything specific you would care to talk about? Any particular feelings you're feeling that are more present than others lately? - I'm not specifically feeling like talking at all. I'm deliberately isolating. I'm keeping to myself in order to process my pain. There's nothing wrong with that. - No, there really isn't anything wrong with that. We all have ways of processing pain. But we can get stuck in a loop, and that can be quite unhealthy. - Well, I do feel like I'm spinning most days. - Right. Your daughter tells me that you sold your business. She mentioned how much you loved being an entrepreneur. - I did. I was really good at it. I was so passionate about that business, but my ex fucked things up on every level. So eventually, I had to sell the business to sever all ties with him, and to save my ass. - The situation with your ex husband sounds pretty complicated. - Not going there. - I understand. I do. - Good. We understand each other. - When you're ready. Why don't we talk about what's making you feel whole again. What are you doing to embrace this new path that you're on? Any self care? - The new path I'm on is pretty bleak. My friend group is tarnished, and I don't wanna gossip about my ex and relive this nightmare of a divorce that I'm just trying to survive. I just don't fucking care. Get it? - I do. I do get it, it's very complex. I think the thing to do is to take a deep inhale. Stretch your arms out. Stretch a little to the right, stretching up to the spine, just letting go of all the tension. And you will. Sam? - Yeah, I know. I guess it's been a while. - Where you been? I mean, I heard what happened. - Well, I've been in a loop, according to my fancy new shrink. - I saw your daughter a few days ago. She still comes in a good amount. You two have been coming here for so many years. - Gosh, I know. I used to bring her in here with me when she was, what? Four years old? Was she the cutest thing ever? We used to let her get a mini-mani. Not too short. God, she used to love getting her nails done with the ladies. - Did she tell you? - That's a loaded question with her. - We're planning to close our doors next month. Business just not the same. - No, you can't! That's insane. Just when I was beginning to feel like I could rely on something being there for me. - It's a shame, honey. Go wash your hands. Can I get you a water or tea? - I brought my own. Everything is bullshit. Bullshit. Thank you. Much better. Now this is what's up. I'd pay extra just to have someone bring me a glass of wine and some cute little snacks. While I sit back and relax and tell the entire world to fuck off. Except for you, Miriam, not you. You're the best, you're so awesome. - Miss Sam, I like your thinking. Is the water too hot? - See? Is water too hot? You're the only person that cares about me. You pay attention to details and you know that if you're having an emotional crisis, you just need a drink. - Well, honey. You better get in while you can. This baby is moving on with her life. To tell you the truth, I was trying to get a loan in order to buy this place. Fix it up a bit, and bring in some luxury clientele, but bank said no. - No, no. You can't just let it go without a fight, you can't just let it turn to dust. What about all the memories? All the tiny toe nails? Banks are stupid. I'll give you the money, how much do you need? Bank of Sam. My ex would squirm. - That is very kind of you. I think in the end, it's for the best. I don't really wanna take the pressure of running a business anymore. - No, you could do it, you'd love it. I loved it. I loved it. - Just let it all go. Relax into the sweet sound of my voice as I tap, tap, tap you into serenity. Sorry. - You are surrendering to the touch of my soft fingers. Purging into the sacred space. I will keep you safe. Baby, relax. - Sorry. - Who the fuck are you? - Hi, I'm Amethyst, I work here. - And what are you doing in here? You're costing me money, girl. - Yeah, I was just looking for supplies. - Supplies are across the hall. Sorry. - Oh, and let Linda know I need a lock put on that door. - Hello? Hello. I am calling from City Collections. This is an opportunity to resolve the debt. I am looking for David Garcia. ♪ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you ♪ ♪ I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you ♪ - Oh crap. Hey mom. Hey baby. - You sound excited. How did your therapy session go? It was good, I was hoping to tell you all about it. Are you home? - Yeah, I just got back from the gym. Great, I'll be over in a few. I've got the wine. - Okay, sure. Showering, then I'll make some iced tea, okay? Take your time. - Everything okay? - Oh, shit! Well, she's on her way with some big news. Seems like the counseling session went well. - Wait. You still haven't told her, have you? Sneaking around like this feels so strange. Kinda hot, but mostly strange. - Of course I haven't told her. No way, not with everything going on. She has been completely unstable. The last thing she needs are the details of who I'm sleeping with. Now go. - You know they're both gonna find out eventually, then what? - Go. I'm good right now. - More for me. So? How was it? - I never thought I'd be into that talk therapy thing, but I'm starting to embrace her words and take my life back. - Wow, that is so nice to hear. How so? - Well, I went to our spot today, and I treated myself to a mani/pedi. Felt so good. - Gosh. Yeah, I am so bummed that they're closing down. That place has been a staple in our lives for quite some time. - I know sweetheart. Miriam told me that they were gonna shut the doors soon. Well, it broke my little already demolished heart, so I bought it. - What? - Well, I couldn't just let it disappear. And my therapist is telling me I have to do things that make me happy. You know how much I loved running that business with your dickhead father. - Mom! - It just felt right. I want to create something beautiful and unique for people, and I need this, baby. - Of course, mom. You know dad is gonna freak, right? - Bingo. - Great, honey, isn't this exciting? Oh, these ones next. - Don't worry, I got it. - Kristen, sweetheart, time to go get the keys! Do you need some help? - Girl, we're running out of time to get our entries dialed in. - I don't know if I have time for all this, I'm trying to work. - Hello, winning thousands of dollars doesn't sound like working it to you? - You really think we can do this? - Duh! But not if you don't practice some new techniques. Besides, I have a photo shoot tomorrow, and I need to look fly. Come on, I'll tag you online to build some steam. - All right, sit down. You're too much. Amethyst! I need to talk to you, in the back. - Coming. - I got a phone call this morning from a bill collector looking for you. - Oh, shit. - They want me to garnish your wages from some old debt. Now of course I told them to fuck off. But listen, I'ma need to cut your hours. If you're full time, my hands are tied, and they will do whatever they need to do to get their money. I don't know what's going on, but you gon' have to get it together. - Thanks, Linda. - Ooh girl, these look fly as hell! - Thank you. - Thank you. Ooh! Oh, like Picasso nails. - Girl, you are so talented. - They look really good. Thank you. - Thank you. Ooh Linda, have you heard of this? - It's just another nail salon popping up. Seems like they come around, and then poof, they're gone in about six months. - Great. Like we need to slow down! - Mimi! Relax. - We need to run an ad or something, maybe pass out some coupons. I could create a discount code and share it online. - That, and how about we win ourselves some money? - Ooh bitch, yes! - Let me know what you girls need, I'm here to support you. - Okay, we're doing this. - We're totally gonna win. - What? Can I help you? - Yay, I've been waiting for this package! - What is that? - My clients are going to love this. - Well, aren't you gonna open that? - Yeah, of course, but not until the cameras are rolling. - I'm not sure I follow. - I do all of my unboxing on camera. It's all about sensory play. Close your eyes. Listen. Get lost in the soothing sound and let my voice guide you. - Oh, shit! Sorry. So that's supposed to be like relaxing, right? - Some find it relaxing, some find it stimulating. It's all about specific sounds, sights, and feelings. ASMR is quite magical. - ASMR? - Autonomous sensory meridian response. It's meant to make you tingle up your spine, back of your neck. Those warm, fuzzy feelings that come over you when you experience bliss. I can control that in people. Direct the experience and take them on a journey. It's really quite profound. - And people are like actually into this? - All about it. Imagine being able to just turn the world off for a while without using drugs or alcohol to tune things out. - Food for thought. - We give the best mani/pedis in town. Let me see your hands. Sure. - Oh, we could buff your nails up, give you a nice shine, maybe massage your hands with some silky smooth lotion. - Oh, you need pedicure! Nasty toe, hey I heard you! - Yo, Mimi! Yo, Mimi! I don't think your approach is working. Come on, let's go get a drink and try a different spot. Let's go. What is this? What's sticking out? - Come on. This is crazy. Oh my god, the chairs look like thrones! - They're not messing around, are they? - This means war. Oh my god, that place is crazy! I know, so crazy! How are we gonna compete with that? I don't know about this! - These coupons better work, or we're totally screwed! - You girls get worked up so easily. So what? There's a new nail salon opening up. That's why we're getting out here and getting new business. - Yeah, but this place is off the hook. They have these crazy chairs, and so many mirrors. - Yeah, and all the polish! - They're decorating right now and holding interviews. - Okay, okay. Would it make you all feel better if I go check it out? Yes! - All right mom, where do you want it? - I say right in the front door. - Linda! Linda! Come on in. - Hi, Sam. - I couldn't help but notice a bunch of folks peering into my window. Who would have ever guessed it would be you. - Yes. I just heard there was a little salon opening up down the street. I thought I'd come check it out. - Yes, this is my new luxury nail house. We're just adding the finishing touches until we launch. My daughter Kristen's going to help me run it. Isn't it beautiful? - It's okay. - Kristen! Kristen, sweetheart. Meet the regular nail salon owner, Linda. The Linda. - I've heard a lot about you. - I bet you have, Kristen. - Listen, I'd love to stay and continue this precious little talk, but I have things to do. Goodbye. - I don't know how we're gonna complete with that salon. Our coupons better work, or we're totally screwed in this contest. - What we gonna do? Those bitches gonna snake all our business! - We don't know that for sure, just relax for a minute. - Yo Linda, Mimi has a point. We're all starting to trip. - I mean, who the hell does this girl even think she is? Just rolling up in on us like that? Acting like she owns the place? Girl. - It's Sam. She always has to have her way, at any cost. Always has. Sammy, Sammy, oh my gosh! Look at what Kyle left in my locker this morning. Oh wow, Linda. - I know! - That's exciting! - I know! - I wish someone would leave a note for me in my locker. - Oh! - Well, other than Chubby Ronnie. - I think this means that he wants to take me to the house party this weekend. You know, the one with the football player's house? Okay, okay. You can come too, you can totally come too. We need to go shopping! Oh my! Shit, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I should probably go pee before we head out. Oh, I wanna go pee too. No. I need to get him some water too. - Good idea. I got him. - Pee-pee time? - Buddy? - Yeah? - You feeling good, or what? - Yeah. Yeah, where's Linda? I'm thirsty. - She's gonna go grab you some water. - Yeah? - Why don't we have a bit of fun in the meantime? Do you like touching these? - Girl, what are you doing? Hey, what? - It's fun. - That's it. - A massage. - Do you like touching these? - Yeah. I like touching. - That bathroom was small. Well, here's his water. - Oh, hi babe. - What? Fuck you! - Get your hands off of me you jerk! Linda! - What? What is happening? - Any time she's had the opportunity to tear me down or outdo me, she's all over it. - What a bitch! - The ultimate bitch! - I kill that bitch! - Mimi! Don't do that! - Look, we need to take her down proper. - The magazine contest! - How's that gonna work? She doesn't even know about it. - Not yet. But there's one spot open, and you know as soon as she knows that you're competing, she's gonna be all over it. Come on. - Okay, Vivian. Looks like you've worked with Miriam before. She is currently our lead technician, and we need to hire a few more solid people to join the team. - I do nail very well. - Great. See, we are aiming to offer a very special experience here. What else would make you a good fit here? - No happy ending. I do very nice nail. - Of course not. But we are not looking to offer that kind of service here, no. Just something a little more personal, like offering a glass of wine with a pedicure, and a choice of scrub. That sort of thing. - I not a bartender. I do nail. - Excuse me a minute. How's the recruiting coming along? - Great, yeah. Great. - We thought you might be interested in this little contest coming up. Might help you build a reputation, bring in some business. - Okay, why are you showing me this? Knowing there's beef between Sam and Linda? My mom was a hot mess last night after that run-in, not to mention what this is doing to my personal life. - We're just trying to make sure everybody gets a shot here, okay? And hey, maybe we could figure all this drama stuff out, through a fair and square competition. Plus, the winner walks away with a chunk of change. - Gee, thanks. Bitch. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm here for the job opening. - Great. Have a seat, I'll be with you in just a minute. - Hey you! - Ben, hey! What are you doing here? - Thought I'd come say hi. Besides, you've been pretty much living here and I miss my girl. Figure I can check out the space. It's looking good. - Thanks, but seriously, I don't think you should just be showing up here. I mean, what if Sam sees us? - Come on, this isn't high school. Who cares if she sees us? - You just don't get it. Your mom might not care about us dating. By the way, have you said anything? I mean, a couple of Linda's girls came by here and they said some things that made me worry. - Just lighten up, okay? It's gonna be fine. - You better go. I have one more interview that should be here any moment, okay? I'll call you tonight. - Kristen baby, the next girl is here. - Great, thanks mom. - Yes, hello, I'm calling to report a violation of nail salon. Nectar Nails, N-E-C-T-A-R. Filthy, filthy, dirty. I've been going there for years, but it's gotten out of control, and I feel like it's my duty to report them. I'm 99 % sure that I got my toenail fungus there. My left big toe. And also, I'm almost positive they have illegals. Illegals working there, yes. Thank you so much, I just think someone should really get over there as soon as possible. It's urgent. You're so welcome. - All right, we'll see you later today. Okay thanks, bye. It's gonna be a busy one today. I guess those coupons you ladies hustled worked after all. - Sometimes you just gotta put yourself out there. Show the world who you are. You should never be afraid to shine. - Girl, I'm not trying to be all up on the internet. I know, again, just trying to build some steam for the competition that we're gonna rock. - Okay, girl, okay. Thanks for the press and all, but I have got to get mentally prepared for this contest and my first client. Mrs. Hamilton's coming in today. Oh my god, that woman, she thinks I'm her therapist. Story after story, drama after drama. - Goes with the territory, boo. - Mrs. Hamilton, nice to see you. Pick a color and come on back. - What? I don't want the color purple, and I want a pedicure too. - Okay, hon. Pick a color! - Oh, have I got a story for you today, you will be just die. What are you up to, new girl? - Oh, just ordering some supplies for the salon. And Mimi, I've been working here for a while now, you don't have to call me new girl. - You're still new girl, and I can't say your name. - Understandable. Is there something you're looking for? - No. I usually like to smoke some weed before my first client come in. - No thank you, I'm already anxious enough as it is. - Chill me out. Mimi, you're next client's waiting! - Damn girl, I'm coming, I'm coming! - It's another fine day, and if I may say, you are stealing it today. - I got you today. The usual? - Yes. - Okay, come on. - Hey hon, it's gonna be a bout a 30 minute wait, so if you just wanna pick out some colors-- - Actually, I don't need my nails done, thanks. Sam actually sent me over here to tell you that we accept your challenge. You know, the nail contest? - Oh bitch, I know. - She wrote a note. Linda and her girls better bring their A-game, we plan to take this by a landslide. There'll be no doubt who has the best salon in town. - She sent you? - Now, now ladies, let's not go and kill the messenger. She delivered the news, and now y'all got the blues. Can't you see this is predetermined and meant to be? Sam is just trying to steer the pot, hear me now. Finger and finger, and toe to toe will go until the winner will go to the throne. So create from the heart, 'cause that's the start, and true art will prevail. - Thanks for that? - My pleasure, pony. - Pony? Pleasure pony? What do you go by on this Earthly ground? - Are you asking me my name? Aurora. Aurora, seems I was wrong all along, my dear, you are dancing light, a prism of rainbows, and unicorn out of sight. - Thanks for that. I should go back to work. - Until then is now, may your day be filled with much wow, my mythical creature. - God, that looks delicious. Linda. That can go to voicemail. - Seriously, what's the deal with you two? Like, how long has this been going on? - Ever since your dad and I got together, it's been a thing. - Speaking of dad. Hey dad. Good, good yeah. Oh, you are? Well, I'll be around, if you wanna stop by or grab a cup of coffee. Great, dad. Yeah, I look forward to seeing you. Okay, bye. - I take it your dad is coming through now. Did you tell him about the salon? - No, I'm sure he already knows. Plus, I don't wanna contribute to extra drama. We have enough going on. - Did you tell him about the boy you've been dating? - Mom, I-- - Sweetheart, it's all right. It's all right. How long did you think you were gonna hide it from me anyway? You're allowed to date, for Christ's sake. Just because your father and I couldn't hold it together doesn't mean there isn't hope for you. And besides, from what I could tell, he's kinda cute. Give me some more ice cream. - Okay. - Just promise me something. If this gets serious, I wanna meet him, okay? - Sure, mom. - Cheers. - You got this. You need this. It's all gonna work out. It's all gonna be fine. Please leave your message. - Hi dad. It's me. I know it's been a minute, I could really use somebody to talk to right now. You know, like family. I hope you understand that I'm still me. Could you just call me? - David. My son. I struggle every day with the choices that you've made. Don't support it. Of your life, which is why I've cut you off. My fucking dad! - Okay, David. Okay. Tell me a bit more about your experience in a beauty salon environment. - Well, I've always been a fan of all things beauty and fashion, I actually went to school for design, and I've worked for a couple salons. I'm all about glam. - Okay, great! Are you okay with working weekends? Right now we have a part time opening. - Yeah, totally, that's fine. I'm actually also available for after hours, or any extra time. - Perfect. - Hey loves, it's your girl, Kelly Styles! And I'm out here in beautiful Los Angeles, California. I'm so excited to tell you about this upcoming event. So the nail salon that I work at is in this dope magazine contest, and we've got a chance to win some big bucks. So, we could really use your help. Come on down next week and witness all the fun for yourself. Yours truly is gonna be throwing down some sick beats, so that you can shake it while we all watch who will be Elite LA's top nail salon.

Hand me a towel? - Slime, how is that supposed to be relaxing? - You don't get it, do you? Anything can be ASMR if presented properly. - Is that right? - I make these custom videos for some of my clients. They basically get to write the script, and choose what medium I work with. - Okay. - Pays really well. I might need an assistant. You into weird shit? - I could be. Don't mind if I do. - Dive in, baby. - Finally, the time has come! - Smile, mom! - Did you get it? - Yeah. It looks great. - Thanks, baby! Let's open the doors and pop that champagne!

She's been okay. - That's good, I'm sure she's probably drowning herself in her sorrows. - Yeah, she's embracing life. - Sure moving on then. - Something like that. - Yeah? Well, I caught wind of this recent acquisition, actually. - Dad, about that, she's-- - Oh no, no, I don't want anything to do with that. I'm moving on, I'm trying to be separate from your mother and her antics. - You okay? - I'm all right, honey. It's really good to see you. - Yeah, it's so good to see you too. - Girl. - Good day to you, fabulously friendly female. Hello!

You see, I will wait patiently for my unicorn to appear, and when she does, I have no fear that the magic will manifest right here. - Okay.

What kind of business you running? - Miss, please lower your voice. I assure you, this must be an accident. Vivian would never try to hurt one of our clients, right Vivian? - I do good nail. She crazy! - She called me crazy! - I will take care of this, we will make this up to you. I'll take care of everything. Kristen! What's going on? - Pump her service, bring her another bottle of champagne. There was some little mishap with Vivian, I've gotta go talk to her. - Well, here's a towel for our legs, and I brought you some champagne, I'll be right back with the flute. - Oh. And good one, Mandy. - Here's to the blossoming of your colorful heart. Let it become a visual work of art. - I've never seen anything like this.

Let's get it. - Clean it just so people can mess it all up? - Mimi girl, we get to host a party. It's gonna be so legit! Let's just put on some music and get it started. - Ooh bitch, yes. ♪ Now give me that dum ♪ - My question is, where do we put the DJ booth? - Oh girl, let me get those for you. - How was your day off, new girl? - Oh you know, groceries and laundry. How was it here? - Good, good. Oh, your manicure's so nice. You do it? - Of course I did. - Hello! Hi, my name is Latoya Smith, and I'm with the LA County Health Department. Shit! - What can I do for you Mrs. Smith? - There's been a complaint filed. May I have a word with the owner? - She actually left, but I'd be happy to relay a message to her. - This here is a write up notice. There have been some concerns come our way. Public health concerns regarding dirty tools and fungus, just to name a few. Now, you guys have five days to get this place in ship shape. We will be stopping by as we deem necessary to make sure you're not sending people out into the world with funky fungus feet. Now you see, we've had a real problem around here, and it would be a shame to have another local business close down. Be done. Gone! Get it together, girls. - Okay. - Yeah? - Sam. It's Linda. - Linda? - Look, I know there's been some heat between us for many years, but I'm past it. I'm past the nonsense, and I just wanna be in the now. - Yeah, I really believe in the power of now. Live your best life. Just do it. Live it big. Purpose. - I know you had a really tough year, especially with the divorce and all. - Are you calling just to rub this in my face? Because I'm doing just fine. I don't need your pity. Oh, a little birdie told me that you had the Health Department pay you a little visit today. In some hot water? - Are you kidding me? What is wrong with you? Does this behavior really make you feel good? Fine, be a bitch. You're so good at it. - Really? Really? You wanna talk about the now? Okay, I'll talk about the now with you, this is what's happening now. Elite LA. You and your little crew are going down. And after that, your entire salon. Bye-bye for now. - I guess some things will never change. Bring it, bitch! - I'm taking my life back now. - Hey mom! Whoa. Everything okay? - I wish I could say yes, but this shit with Sam, it's draining my last nerve. First the salon, then the competition, and I know she called the Health Department on me. - What? Why would she? I knew she was an ass, but really? - This shit is draining me. I'm always trying to take the high road, but she's wearing me down. This stress is affecting my business, and the girls! - Look ma, I'm here. I got your back, and I know the girls do as well. - Son. I know you have a relationship with Sam's daughter. - I think that's run its course, especially after all this. How could I trust anyone involved with Sam at that level? I wanna focus on being there for you, mom. Really. - Thanks son, I really appreciate that. - Can't be drinking alone, let me refill this. - Tomorrow's the big day, and I am beyond stoked to be a part of this. Come down and witness all the magic for yourselves. I'll be dropping beats and posting Tweets. - Okay you guys, tomorrow is the big day. We have a chance to put our lovely new beauty bar on the map. The Elite LA featuring us as the top salon in town will change the game for all of us. Not to mention the pretty penny we will win. - Penny? I don't work for a penny. - We've been practicing. - Kristen, ladies, how's it going? - We're just getting pumped about the contest tomorrow. - Wonderful, because losing is not an option. - It's times like this that I miss having that man. - Mom, I'm here! Mom, are you getting ready? Mom? Mom! Mom! Holy shit, mom! Mom, get up, mom! Mom, wake up! Wake up, mom! Mom, wake up! Mom! Mom, come on! Come on, mom! Mom! Yes, there it is, there's Sam! Come on, mom! - Can we stop and get coffee? I need coffee. Don't you? What? - You know you're lucky I found you. Passed out drunk. And all that glass, just seriously Sam! You sound just like your father when you call me Sam. Besides, I wasn't even that drunk. I slipped, hit my head, it was an accident. - I called him. Dad. - Are you kidding? - No mom, I'm not kidding. Okay, the drinking, it's a thing. It's sad and it's scary. Okay, I don't think I can handle finding you like that again. - Oh great, just great, one more thing for him to use against me. The two of you are ganging up on me. - Look, I have done nothing but support you and put my life on hold to help you get back on track, but you have to be willing to help yourself too, mom! Okay, I want to see you happy, and healthy, and able to move on from your struggles with dad. I mean, there's so much more out there! Let's just get through this day, okay? Win this contest, and figure out a plan, okay? - Can I have some coffee now? - You know. Coffee does sound good. - Nothing beats good coffee in the morning, does it sweetheart? Don't you think? What is it, sweetheart? - Ben just messaged me, he broke up with me thinking I had something to do with Linda's shop and the Health Department? - That seems overly dramatic. Wait, wait. Ben, Linda. You've been seeing her son all this time? Kristen, what the fuck? - Listen mom, we met at school, okay? And I really liked him. Okay. I had plans to tell you, but this whole thing just got so crazy just so fast. I mean, it's obviously over with. I don't even know what he means about the Health Department. - You know what? You're right. Let's just focus on today. Let's just get through today. They're probably just messing with us, and we've got a contest to win.

I don't know why you're always gonna take things away from people, instead of building something for yourself. - I mean it's abusing, it's sad. I mean, I couldn't handle it anymore. The mind games, the constant harming of the mind. - Sam. We used to be such good friends. But you couldn't handle us growing up and growing apart. It really hurt me. And you're hurting me now. - Linda! - Mom. You hurt me too. It's time to stop depending on everyone else. It doesn't mean you have to do it alone. We all support you and love you as an individual.

Mimi told me about your other job. Real clever, but it's a conflict of interest. - Shit, I'm sorry. I didn't really know what to do, I didn't have any other options. - Don't worry. There's no hard feelings. Lola has plenty of work for you to do, and that way we can keep you around. But just know, I'll be watching you. Or better yet, Mimi will be watching you. - Oh, so sorry - Thanks. - So proud of you, what you did. Talking to your mom like that helped her a lot. - Thanks, dad. - Mind if we have a word? - Sure, yeah sure, I'll talk to your later-- - One sec, dad? - Yeah, that's fine. - Hey, I am really sorry about all this chaos. Honestly, if felt like my body was possessed by some alien. - An alien named Sam? Really, I should have been paying more attention about how much pressure you were under, helping your mom and being sucked into the nail vortex. I apologize for accusing you of the whole Health Department thing, I know you didn't do that. - Linda, I'm sorry for everything. I just wanted to say congrats. - Thank you. - You're not mad at me. - Well, I was, yeah. - And Linda, don't worry. I guess the only scare was over some sort of kimchi gone bad. - You sure it was bad? I mean, you can never really tell with that stuff. - Sam. How about we go grab a cup of coffee and chat? Or better yet, let's go to a yoga class. - Oh my gosh, that sounds so great, I would love that! I could use with some balance, I think. - A little balance. Yeah, I need some balance. - Thank you. - Oh, I'm so glad we're talking. Oh, we're friends again. - We're friends again. It can be hard to see the light in the darkest of nights.
