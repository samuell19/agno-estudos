Would you look at that. It's pretty. It's so pretty, it's almost too much. You know? Yeah. Shit, shit, shit. Joe! Joe, I'm late for work, so I'm going to... I'm going to head out. Joe? Did you hear me? - Troy? - Hey, Robert. Hey, sorry it's late, and it's been a while, but... I kind of need a place for the night. - Sure. Everything okay? - Oh, yeah. Never been better. I mean, the truck's fucked, but other than that, nothing but bright horizons ahead and all that. Joe's all tuckered out but, you know, you'll meet him in the morning. So, the truck starts making this rattling sound. Right? And not a good sound. It's like "ting, ting, ting." Truck's a piece of shit. Anyway, I see the turnoff for your road, and I'm like, "Oh, I could stop at Robert's." So the second I pull into your driveway... rattling sound stops and smoke comes pouring in from everywhere. I wasn't asking about the car. I just want to know that you're all right. You okay, man? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I am. But thanks for asking. You're a good buddy. So we'll just stay the night and then head out in the morning. I promised the kid a little camping trip, so... Without a car? I don't know. I'll borrow one or something. I don't want you leaving that truck in the driveway. Oh, okay. It's good to see you, man. Hello? I don't remember Canada. Well, you were just a little baby, but oh, my God, did you love it. - I did? - Yeah. You've always had this adventurous spirit, and they practically invented adventure in Canada, and I think you felt that. I mean, I can't wait to show it to you again. - Yeah. - Look, you think... Look... - Wow. - You think our mountains - are big here in Montana? - Yeah. Wait till you see them in Canada. - They make these look like molehills. - Wow. - You think our rivers are wide? - Yeah. In Canada, you can't even see across them. They're like oceans. Whoa. Look at that hawk. So can you tell me a little more about the situation with your ex-husband? Um... we're not divorced yet. We're... We're separated. Separated, right. And I understand he's served some time, is that right? Yeah, he just got out. I-I let him come by once a week to visit, but the court said I didn't have to. Well, that was very generous. - Yeah, or stupid. - Hmm. So he came by last night, and what happened? You know, every minute you're here, they're getting farther away. I don't know what we're doing. Well, what we're doing is we're getting a better idea of the whole picture, which is very important. Well, the whole picture is this: he took my kid. I don't know how else to spell it out for you. He kidnapped my child. Find it? Here. - Can we heat it up? - No. No fires. Because I don't want to attract attention. - Cowboys eat beans. - Yeah. - I wonder if they fart a lot. - They do. I'm just glad you're sitting downwind of me. You won't be able to escape it. What, is that a threat? Did you just fart? All right. How long is it going to take? - Well, three days at the most. - Whoa. Ready? You up? - Yep! - All right. Let's go. I think there's some in here. Hmm. If you have something current... Oh, this is... This is Joe. Ah. I see. - How old here? - Ten. Hmm. And this is pretty accurate and up-to-date, would you say? - Yeah. - Yeah. She's a very pretty little girl. ♪ Honey, it's been a long day And I'm coming home ♪ I'd tell you what it means, but there's kids around. Come on. - I never wanted to date Daisy. - Joe! Look at you. Oh, wow. Twins. We are matching. We look cute though, don't we? - You always did like your dolls. - Shut up, Jerry. You look great, baby. You want a burger? - Yeah. - Okay. I'll make you a burger. - So... - Yeah? Stop it. She's at the checkout line. She's got four items with her. She's got an inflatable pool, one of those dumb little paddle toys with the ball attached to it. - Potato chips. - Who cares? Shut it. And she's got adult diapers. - She smiling? - All right, ready? Smile. Okay, looking good. Joe, loosen up just a little. Okay, come on. All right, just... Here, just put your arm around her, and you put your arm there, and then just tilt. We're all friends. We're all family. And three, two, one. Cheese. Oh, it's perfect. It's a picture. We got it. No, I-I-I was the cook. Yeah, but what's... It was a little burnt. - It wasn't bad. - No. No. Look, I ran out of propane. I didn't think they were burned. Safety first. I didn't want anybody to get sick. The hot dogs were good, but the burger was a little burnt. No, the burgers were fine. The hot dogs were burnt. I'll give you that. Oh, you know what I love about your back? Do not stretch out my dress, please. It's your cute little "scoliosis." It's "scoliosis." And it's not cute. It's your... your pretty little defect. Oh, you want to fight? Hmm? Oh, you're supposed to like the things that are nice about me, you know? Okay, that's our daughter. Only one. Hey, go get your jammies on. It's time for bed. All right. I'm going to go take out the trash... - Uh-huh. I like that. - And then I'm going to tuck that angry little girl of yours in... and I'm going to come upstairs and I'm going to find you. - Oh, is that right? - Yeah. All right. I'm going to go get ready then. - Okay. - Okay. - Hey! - Oh, God! Got your jammies on? Oh, wait, are you trying to win that contest for saddest face in the world? No, don't. Hey, come on, I'm trying to learn how to do it. Make room. There's two cowboys, and they're sitting around the fire drinking hot cocoa. And they're really exhausted, because they've been out panning for gold all day in the hot sun. They look up, and they see a shooting star. And then... And then one of the cowboys gets a text message that it wasn't a shooting star. It was a UFO. - Ooh. - And aliens. Don't want to get her too excited before bed. All right. Yeah. All right, we'll finish this tomorrow, okay? - No. - Good night. - No. - What? Can you please stay until I fall asleep? No, you got to go to sleep. Dad, come on. What? She wants me to stay. I'll be up in a minute, okay? Okay. Okay, uh, where were we? I hope you all had a wonderful Labor Day weekend. Unfortunately, the Labor Day holiday turned into a nightmare for one mother. An 11-year-old local girl, Josie Johnson, disappeared from her bedroom in the early morning hours this Monday. If you have any information regarding her whereabouts, please contact local or state authorities. Again, if you have seen Josie, please call local and state authorities. I can't imagine what her mother is going through right now. I hope they find her soon. She's a darling girl. Hey, let me in. Go away, Jerry. I'm not going to "Go away, Jerry." You need support right now. ...as they walk through what's left of their home. Hey. Jerry, go away. Sis, I'm not going anywhere. Just let me in. Let's talk about it. Hey. Come on, sis. Don't be dumb. You know me. I'll stay right here. Come on. Ain't nobody else coming to help you. Hey! You're going to get yourself killed! Ah, Mrs. Johnson, I was just about to call you. - Why are you here? - What? - Shouldn't you be out there? - Do you want to have a seat? No. No, I'm fine. But I do not understand why you are not out there finding my kid instead of just sitting in here! Okay, let's just take a deep breath. There's a lot going on here. Amber Alert has gone nationwide. We are getting leads all the time. They are all being followed up on. Okay. I am doing this full time. We are going to find your child. Well, some people actually do find me attractive. So what's your excuse? Police Department, Detective Faith Ericson. Yeah. Pad. Yeah. Give me the address. Okay. Got it. Yup. I was going to answer that. You know, if you're bored, you ought to read a book instead of rotting your brain out with that stupid game. You know how to read, don't you? Yes. Glad to hear it. Here we are. Oh, shit. Are we going to search it? I forgot gloves. All right, well, I'm just going to do it without it. Oh! U2! Damn, looks like they played it a lot, too. Can I help you? Faith Ericson. Detective, Flathead PD. So Troy came and just left his truck? Yes. And you're sure he was alone? - Yup. - When's he picking it up? I don't know. How did he leave? On foot, or did... did someone pick him up? I don't know. I was out. Don't you find it irritating that he would just park his truck in your driveway? I mean, it kind of disturbs the pretty picture of your place, doesn't it? That would bother me. No, I mean, it didn't seem anything out of the ordinary. - Do you mind? - Please. Hey, Mom... Okay. Love you. That was my mom. She always tends to lose things. Ah. That's a pretty horse. Yeah. He was a great guy. We had some good times together. Let's go! Come on. - He's tired. - Go! Dad, he's tired. Yeah, I... All right, all right, okay. We'll... we'll camp here. Just up to the tree, buddy. Ready? You taking your medicine? Damn straight. I'm taking it every day. Don't worry. It makes me feel great. I see one. It's huge. It must be a Canadian. Don't scare it. Come on, fishy, fishy. - Let's shoot it. - No, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. You're not touching that gun ever. But I know how to shoot. Yeah, you know how to pull the trigger. That's not the same. Hey, there! We seem to have lost our trail. Uh... Yeah, I think it might be behind you. All right, cool. Thanks. Beautiful day, isn't it? Yeah, we're having a bit of a man-cation ourselves. We're trying to hit all the trails from Ohio out to Seattle. What about you guys? Where are you from? Idaho. Ah, Idaho. One of my favorites. So, I didn't know we were allowed to fish up here. Well, we're just goofing off. Well, you guys enjoy your trip. Let's go, fellas. Come on. Get your stuff. Come on. Let's go. If anything comes up, give me a call. You bet. Thanks, man. This place is cool. What? I'm just going to check the cabin. Yeah, I already checked in there. Yeah, I know you did, Grover. - Yeah! - Whoo! You see that? Jerry, you get the IPA. - Give me this shit. - Thank you, dear. Mwah. I was behind the counter and this guy walks in, and I never seen him before. I figured he's a tourist. He was kind of a rich California... Uh-huh. Oh! He was this tall, handsome, maybe California guy. He orders a cup of coffee... Yeah. ...I say, "Do you want milk with that?" I say, "How much, sir?" Keep at him, keep at him. You got to understand. I said, "Oh, my God." Yeah, and the way he was looking at me... ♪ And it's all a big mistake ♪ ♪ Or am I crazy? ♪ ♪ Completely insane ♪ ♪ I lost your attention ♪ ♪ You don't think of me The same ♪ ♪ I'm no longer In your thoughts ♪ ♪ Have you broke The tie that binds? ♪ ♪ Well, I think I'm ♪ ♪ Going out of your mind ♪ You want to steer? No! I thought you wanted to go out. I said I wanted to talk. You want to talk? Yeah. Come on, don't you want to drive? - No. - What do you...? Okay. You're a weirdo, okay? Okay, what do you want to talk about? Tomorrow. - Yeah. - Uh... can you tell Mom that I don't want to wear dresses anymore? Okay, sure. All right. Dresses suck. But sometimes, you got to wear them. You know, like, for church, parties. Things like that. Whatever. Do you like wearing dresses? Yes. No. Why would I wear a stinking dress? Right. Because you're a boy. - Boys don't wear dresses. - Right. That's why I can't wear dresses anymore. Oh, wait. Don't laugh at me. Oh, okay, I'm sorry. All right, okay, you're a tomboy. You don't want to wear dresses anymore. I'll work on it. - I'm not a tomboy. - What? Tomboy's just another type of girl, but I'm not a girl. I'm sorry, I don't follow you. Sometimes, I think aliens put me in this girl body as a joke. You think aliens abducted you and you didn't tell me about this? - Dad! - What? I'm in the wrong body, okay? I'm a boy! Oh. I think I know what's going on. You know what? I think... you're catching some of them teenage hormones early, okay? Look, they can make you confused. I'm not confused. I've known my entire life. I'm sorry. It's not my fault. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? Hey. - You don't believe me. - I do believe you. No you don't. - Yeah, I do. - You don't. I do. I promise. Mind if we have a chat? How are you holding up? Not great. No. I can imagine. Listen, uh, just came across this and I wondered... have you seen this picture before? No. That is her in the photograph, correct? That's her. Sometimes she likes to dress like a tomboy, but I don't let her go out of the house like this. I don't care if your kid dresses up like Donald Duck, honestly. I just need to know, is there a chance that she looks like that now? Because the photograph that I have makes her look like a totally different person. There's a pretty good chance. She's got short hair now, so... Her hair is short now? That is a significant piece of information. Is there something else I need to know that you're not telling me? Okay. Could you give me a call if something comes to mind? Anything at all? Can you do that? Yes. Okay. All right. I'm going to use this photograph then. Thank you very much. You can't take off like that in the middle of the night. I'm trying to tell you what she told me. Did you hear what I just said about Joe? Yeah. Joe likes cowboy hats. So what? She just wants to be like you. And you encourage it, Troy. No, no, no, no. She said that she is a boy. - Oh, God. - That she feels like she's in the wrong body, like she's... like an alien living in someone else's body. Like that "Body Snatchers" movie. Like the "Body Snatchers" movie? Troy, what are you talking about? Look, I don't know if I understand it - or if it's just... - You just fill her head with all these fucking stories about what it's like to be a man. - But she said... - To be a cowboy. I mean, yeah, I'm sure that sounds like fun to her, going out on joyrides in the middle of the night, going to the bar with your buddies, going fishing, going hunting. I mean, she thinks you're a goddamn hero. Well, look who gets to suck. Look who gets to be the lame-ass mom stuck at home, doing the dishes, cleaning the fucking toilet. I mean, no wonder she wants to be a goddamn boy. She thinks I'm a piece of shit. This is not about you! Jesus Christ. Who would choose to be a girl? Hey. Is there something you want to talk about? No. Okay. You know, when I was your age... my mother and I liked to listen to Peggy Lee. I've played her for you before, right? Yeah, well, when she was young, she was so pretty. And I thought I'd be just like her. Famous and pretty... with a beautiful voice. That was just a funny fantasy. And I'm not that pretty. I can't sing for shit. I'm not Peggy Lee. You can only be one person for your life. You've got one body. You've got one path. And God's got the game plan. And that's just growing up. Good night. Dad, I'm hungry. Do you think we'll catch any fish tomorrow? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure we will. I love you. Love you. Dad, help! Dad! Joe? Joe! Joe! - Dad! - Joe! Where are you? - Dad! - Joe! - Joe, don't move. - Help! Hold on! Hold on! Hold on! Dad! Help! - Dad! - Joe! Joe! - Dad! - Joe! Grab my hand! Dad! Help! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe! Joe, no, no, no! Joe, Joe! Joe! Joe! No! No! I can't hold on. - Dad! - Joe! Joe! - Hold on. - Dad! Joe. Come on. Are you okay? I got you. I'm so cold. Hey... What? I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. What? Where are you going? It's okay. I'll be right back. Dad. Where are you going? Dad! Fuck! Hey, Troy. What? Troy, Troy, Troy. Hey, hey, hey. We're getting paid by the hour on this job, man. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Slow it down a little bit. - I know, but I'm killing it. - You're killing it, but it don't matter how fast you do it. We've got to do this shit all day. Hey, what are you doing? Knock it off. The longer we're here, the more money we make. Maniac. It looks good, though. It does look good, brother. Thanks, Arnold, for your experience of strength and hope. Robert Spottedbird. Sorry I'm late, man. I saw two dogs doing it on the side of the road, and I just had to watch. Oh, I'll get a chair. Then I was worried that they were, like, strays, but they both had collars, so... Can I slip in here, please? Thanks. All right, keep going. Sorry. Sorry, keep talking. I love the coat. Very cool. Is there anyone else that would like to share? All right, the club looks like a lot of fun. I-I-I liked everyone's stories. Well, the stories were okay. Actually, they were kind of boring, but you know what? Alcohol really isn't my problem, Bob. I just wanted you to see what it was all about. - Yeah. - Yeah, I can't force you to do... Oh, sorry. Excuse me. - I'm a married man. - Good for you. Yeah, and a wonderful husband and father, but you are beautiful, like, beautiful. - What are you drinking? - Jesus Christ. - What's going on with you today? - Oh! You know what I was thinking? We should go into business together. Joint auto body shop, coffee shop. Are you on something? Yeah. It's called ambition, Robert. And apparently, I have enough for the both of us. Don't you want to make something of your life? This is a big... Oh, fuck. I got to go, okay? How. - Dude, what's going on? - Hey, nothing. I've just got to go... Hey, I left my cash in the car. You got this, right? Here. Try these. You don't throw the boots down on the ground. You try them on. These are nice. What about these? These look like Miss America boots. No way. I know I'm late. I'm sorry. That's a bad thing? Wow. 40 minutes, Troy. Now I'm late. Come here. - Just blame it on me. - Oh, I will. If I don't get this job, I will blame it on you. - No. - I know. Pick something normal. - These ones. These ones. - Yes! - Yeah. Yeah. - Those look pretty cool. - They do. - Come on. Here, just walk around. Like, try them out. Yeah, those are pretty cool. Hell, yeah. This one screams Paul Newman, and I'm pretty sure I had the same shirt when I was a kid. - Hey, brother. - Oh, shit. Hey, man. What's up, Joe? Oh, you just missed your sister. Yeah? Well, I hate seeing her anyway, you know what I mean? Yeah. She hates you too. Ma'am, do you have any cowboy boots that look less like shit? I'm not sure what you mean. Hey, where's your bathroom at, ma'am? - Right there in the back. - Thanks. - Hey, you watch the little ones? - Yeah, sure. H-How do you...? You don't know what I mean? Dad? Hey! - Get out of here. - Wow. Your clothes. - You look like a dyke. - I'm not a dyke. - You look like a dyke to me. - I'm not a dyke! - Dyke! - I'm not a dyke. - Hey, dyke. - Get off me. Hey! What the fuck are you doing? You get off on that? Are you okay? Get the... Get back here, you little shit! Dad, stop! Dad! Oh, now you're innocent, huh? Huh, you big man? You want me to show you what a big man does? Hey! Hey! - Oh... man. - Oh, my God. Sal, is he okay? You stay back. Jerry, are you okay? - Fuck, no. - Hey, I didn't mean it. I'm sorry, Jerry. It's okay. All right. But you didn't hear what Stevie said. So, I come out of the bathroom, he's attacking my kid out of nowhere. Sorry. And I go to pull him off of him, and... Stay here. I'm his boss and his brother-in-law. - This guy's a wacko. - Jerry, come on. - What? Come on, what? - Come on. You're giving false information here. I'm not giving out false anything. Look, I know that Troy can be an idiot. He attacked my kid, and then he tried to kill me, that's what happened. Actually, it was attempted manslaughter, officer. - Manslaughter? - That's what it was. Manslaughter is when you kill someone by accident, you moron. Screw you. I know what manslaughter means. - What is it? - I'm pressing charges. How do you like that shit? I'd like to press charges, officer. Jerry, Jerry, you can't press charges. You're going to be punishing me then, you know that? - I'm not punishing... - That's what you're doing. - You're punishing me. - No, I'm doing you a favor! - Screw you. Screw you! - Okay.

Tonight, authorities are no closer to finding the missing local girl. 11-year-old Josie Johnson disappeared from her home last week on September 2nd. It's now believed her father, Troy Johnson, pictured here, abducted her. If you have any information regarding her whereabouts, please contact the local or state authorities. We got canned beans. We got some crackers. We got Snickers bars. We got... What the hell is this? Oh. Gourmet yak jerky. Man, this is what the Tibetans eat. You see your picture? They must've pulled that one out of my truck, which means they've been to Mr. Spottedbird's. But he's got our back. Don't worry. We're outlaws, son. What are you doing? Can I get this? You don't need those. I like this one. And it's only one dollar. I'll pay you when I get home. I have money saved up. Let's pick one toy. Or we'll pick none. That's what I thought. Let's pick one toy. How about this? Look, that's fun. I'm trying to help you out here. Come on. She's cool. Look at her. I don't want that. Okay, well, then we're not getting any toys today. Joe. Joe. What about this? No, we're not getting that book. Put it back. Why? Dad would get it for me. When other little girls come over to play, they are not going to want to play with these toys or read those books. You want friends, don't you? Not dumb ones. - Okay. - Mommy, no. No. Put it back. Joe, I am not going to fight with you here. Put the book back. Man! Sorry, I'm late. That's okay, man. Thanks, buddy. You bet. Bye! Not very friendly. Oh, that one guy's a dick. Joe. Let me just... Stop it. I know you haven't seen your dad in a long time, and it might be kind of weird. It's okay to be upset. I'm upset too. Can you put this on? - No. - Joe. - Hi. - Hey. - Joe's out back. - Oh, okay. Hey. Oh, you got so tall. It looks like you got some muscles there too. Mom wouldn't let me visit you. You're too young to see the inside of a jail anyway. I wanted to see you. Mom threw out my pants. Are you serious? Yeah. That sucks. Yeah. I'm pretty sure Mom's a witch. Your mom is not a witch. She's a beautiful person. She doesn't understand you yet, but she will. You know, Dad, no one asked me if I wanted to live with you or Mom. It isn't fair. Joe... I'm really trying. See you next week. Dad, wait! - Joe, come on. - Whoa! Here. This is for later. Love you. Love you, too. - What'd you get? - Nothing! I'll see you later. - Bye, Dad! - Hey, um... you look beautiful, by the way. Thanks.

We're not that far from the border. Check it out. We're right here. We just got to go here. So we're just going to do this. Cross the river. That's it. - Are you okay? - Am I okay? Look who I'm with. Look where we are. I am beyond okay. You just seem a little excited. Excited? Huh? Yeah, excited. I'm just... I'm just trying to wake you up. Okay. I just thought you were acting a little weird or something. What? Oh. No, I know what you're saying. No. No way. No way. I didn't see you take your pill. Of course, I'm taking my pills, kiddo. Come on, get up. You good? Oh, hey there. Hey. What are you doing here? Um... Can we... Can I talk to you? Um, I'm heading to work, so... What time's your shift start? Well, 3:00, but I have a few errands to run, so... Um, maybe I can take you out sometime? - Yeah. - I'm thinking I can... Yeah, I don't think so. Let's just not push this because, you know, I'm already letting you see Josie, and I don't have to, so let's just leave it what it is. Sal... I messed up. I put you in a real crappy situation. - Yeah. - You know, I would've left me, too. But I've done a lot of work, and I'm new and improved. Come on. Just talk to me for a little bit. Five minutes. Come on, talk to me for five minutes. You are so beautiful. You don't think I look older? Mm-mm. I never lost the baby fat. And I got wrinkles. - Nah. - Look. - You don't have wrinkles. - Yeah. Okay. Hey, I think we should move to someplace different. Huh? No, we're not moving anywhere. Hey. Why not? Fresh start. Come on. That's not the way things are anymore. Well, maybe not right now... but maybe you just need to get used to me again. Huh? We're not going backwards. Uh, yeah, but we're... I'm different. - You're not different. - Yes, I am. - No, you're not. - Come on. We still got sparks. Right? Joe and I get each other. Come on. Look, hey, hey, hey. I start my new job next week, so let's just go get dinner tonight. We're not getting dinner, Troy. Why? Are you busy? Because I'm just starting to get Joe back to normal. Sally... you are not God, okay? And Joe is not some lump of clay that you just pound into something. Joe is Joe. We either accept that or you fuck him up. You messed her up. You messed her up. I don't want to eat dinner anyway. I'm glad we used a condom. Hey, you like the mountains in Montana? Well, they're a hell of a lot bigger in Canada. The bears are bigger, the rivers run clearer, and they're a hell of a lot nicer. And they know how to respect someone. They'll know how to respect you, because they're nice as shit. We're going to live there? Well, we're not going there on vacation. I mean, who does that? Can we tell Mom that we're okay? Hey, your mother doesn't understand you like I do, and she wasn't very nice to you. Well, yeah, I know, I know, I know. She's not all that bad, not 100%. I mean, at one point, we were crazy in love with each other. I mean, you were born into, like, really good feelings. Like a couple of nuts. We couldn't get enough. And then it got to the point where I'd go up and touch her, and she'd be, like, "What?" Like I was some kind of leper or something. Hey, do you think lepers still exist in the world? I mean, why do you think she was like that? I mean, why did she change like that, huh? You're kind of complicated sometimes. Yeah, I'm fucking complicated! Hey, buddy, I live in the gray zone, okay? I mean, I like my bread buttered on both sides. Do you know why? Because I'm fucking great. And nobody great wasn't complicated. You understand? I mean, what are you talking about? You're fucking complicated too. And I see that. I'm good with that. But a lot of dads wouldn't be. - Yeah. - You understand that? Hey, you got it? Look... hey, I'm just... I'm just... I'm just trying to tell the truth, okay? But you get that, right? You... You know. You got that. Yeah. Joe's about to be hitting puberty... and I think that's gonna be a tough enough time as it is, so... until you can get a court to tell me that I've got to let you visit, I think it's best that you stay away. - What?
