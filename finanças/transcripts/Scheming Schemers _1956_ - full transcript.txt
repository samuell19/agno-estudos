[♪♪♪] [PHONE RINGS] Nite and Day Plumbers. Uh, I-I'd like you to come right out to 1414 Bleeker Street right away. Uh, ask for Mr. Norfleet. We'll be over in two shakes of a martini. Ha-ha! Boy! Our first case. Oh! [LAUGHS] [GRUNTS] [SIREN WAILING] Come on, you slugs! We're rollin'! Heep-eep-eep! [SNORING] Oh, stubborn, eh? Hey, come on, Shemp. It's our first call. [GRUNTS] We gotta get a longer jeep. [CRICKETS CHIRPING] I dropped a very valuable diamond ring down into this washbasin drain. Please, don't give up until you find it. Don't worry, boss. We'll have your ring back before you can say "Cucamonga." That's fine. My wife has guests and is unveiling a new Van Brocklin painting she just bought. Please, work quietly. Okay, we'll be quiet. [LOUD CLATTER] Quiet! [LOUD CLATTER] I said quiet! Come on, get busy here! All right. Get the ring. [BOTH GRUNT] Come on, get that plate out of there! All right. Think you got something. How about that? It was stuck on the inside rim all the time. Call Mr. Norfleet. Mr. Norfleet, we found the-- Get it! [BOTH GRUNT] You knucklehead, you! You're gonna get that ring if I have to shove you down the pipe after it. Wait a minute, there must be another way. I'll show you. Moe, no, please! Get up there. Ow, ow! Ow, you're crushin' my skull! Well, get that ring! Ow! I won't fit in here. By golly, he's right. His ears are in the way. I gotta get something. Oh, yeah. A wrench. [GRUNTING] Oof! [GROWLS] [SIGHS] Oh, no, he couldn't have. He couldn't have gone down that drain pipe. Larry, where are you? LARRY: I'm down here. [GASPS] I'll figure something out, kid. Wait a minute. I'll figure something out. Come on, Moe. Get busy. Okay, kid. I'll be with you in a jiffy. Take it easy, kid. I'll find a way. Now easy, Larry. [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] Hm. I got part of him. I'll have to take him out in pieces. Take your time, kid. Hey, Moe, what are you doing? I'm trying to get you out of this pipe, you sap. What did you do, blow your stack? I'll blow your stack. I'll smack you in the snoot. I'll-- Larry! I can't get it out. Help me, will you? I'm stuck. Take it easy, kid. I'll get you out. [GRUNTS] Your hand all right? I don't know. It's all right. Ow! Give me that. I hope that ring's in here. Ow! I'll murder you! Take it easy. Hey. That ring went down that drain pipe. How do you know it didn't go down the water pipe? Maybe it did. [HORN HONKING] Hey, Shemp! We're in here! We got a lot of work to do, so shake a leg! Hold your horses, will you? I think that ring slid down one of the pipes into the basement. We all better go down there and find it and hurry. Well, don't rush me. I gotta wash my hands. Oh. Who do you think I am, anyhow? Hey, anyhow? What? [GROANING] Come on. Come on. Come on, anyhow. Come on. That's got it. But we didn't locate the ring. Hold on to this, and don't let it slip. Give me that blow torch. [SCREAMING] Get my foot out of there! Okay. [GRUNTS] Now see what you did? What? Get out of here. Wait a minute. We can't find the ring while it's leakin'. I wonder where you shut the water off. It must be upstairs. Water always runs downhill. You're a very intelligent imbecile. Thanks. Yeah. Shut the water off! All right. Go on! I'm gettin' nervous. MOE: Yeah! Go get busy! We're simply dying to see the Van Brocklin. Well, I'll not keep you waiting. Ah. A great help you are. That other chowderhead didn't shut the water off, now you do it. Here. Wait a minute. Where will I find a valve? That's your job, you dummy. Look in the kitchen. Look in the attic. Look in the backyard. All right. Oh, it's divine. What color. What detail. And it's over 200 years old. Every museum in the country tried to buy it. It's a masterpiece, all right. What idiot left this water running? I did. [GRUNTING] I wonder where those other lugs are. I gotta get rid of this water. [CHUCKLES] Ah. Success at last. What an idea. [SCREAMS] What's the matter? What's going on? I'll murder... Hey, I better go find that water cutoff. [GRUNTS] I'll find that ring if it kills me. [GRUNTS] I'll find that water cutoff. [WHISPERING] It's the real Van Brocklin, all right. Worth a fortune. [WHISPERING] Okay, we'll watch our chance. Go on, get another length of pipe! Go ahead! [GRUNTING] Hey, Moe. No wonder the water don't woik. These pipes are clogged up with wires, look. Well, yank 'em out and we'll hook the pipes up all over again, you oyster brain. Go on! All right. No, we don't go in for sculpture. It's too bulky. We-- Oh, dear. Oh. As I said, we don't-- I, heh-heh. Everything-- White all colors... I don't have-- Short circuit, no doubt. [WIRES CREAKING] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] LARRY: Where is that water cutoff? That does it. End of the line. Okay. We'll try and get these pipes together and everything will be oaky-dokey. All right. This house has sure gone crazy. I never thought I'd do it. Success! Ha-ha! I'll find this thing, or else. Oh, must be a loose washer. How do you like that? I'll fix that in a minute. Got to be a loose washer or something. Oh. Oh, oh! Ooh! Dear me. I can't understand what's holding up dinner. Sorry, folks. Dinner's postponed on account of rain. Well, I'm sure it won't be long. Shall we see what's on the television set? Uh, excellent. Uh, excellent idea. [CLEARS THROAT] We get the most amazing results. ANNOUNCER: Good evening, friends. That's odd. There's sound, but no picture. Our special feature for tonight will be glimpses of scenic America. First we take you to Niagara Falls. I'll get it in a minute. Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! What?! Change your clothes dear, you're all wet. I'll let the water run out the window. that's what I'll do. Oh, yeah? Hm. NORFLEET: I saw your television, people! Madam, shall I get you some water? No! Oh, my painting! It's gone! Nobody leaves the house! Sorry, just the formality. I'll call the police. Who--? What do I--? Op-- Operator! What? [COUGHS] I tell you, Moe. I couldn't find that water shutoff. Shutoff. Shut up! Maybe the ring went behind that basin. Here. Pry that basin away from that wall just one inch, so I can look behind it. Now if I was a ring, where would I go? [CRUNCH] Ow! [YELLING] I'm sorry, Moe. So am I. Ow! You imbecile, you! [GROANS] Hey! The ring has been in your hair all the time. Mr. Norfleet! Mr. Norfleet! Mr. Norfleet! Come here! Here's your ring, Mr. Norfleet. Oh, thank you. Oh, I'm frantic, gentlemen. Frantic. Someone stole our new $50,000 painting. [WHISPERING] Where's Shemp? He loves pictures. I think he's upstairs. Wait here, boss. We'll be right back. Come on. Anything. Anything, I... I must have a drink of water. You folks going somewhere? Just looking for a drink of water. Turn on anything, you'll get it. He's gone. We can't make it out that way. We'll be searched. Yeah. Yeah. They won't find anything. I'll put the picture in here until the excitement blows over. They'll never find the painting in this pipe. You go to the car. I'll be right with you. [ALL GRUNTING] Ah, you crook, we got you. Let me alone! I'll brain you! Don't you dare throw that pie. [CROWD GASPS] [CROWD CHATTERING] Ack! Oof! Oh, I'm sorry, Moe! I'm sorry, I didn't see you-- Why, you... Oh, no, you don't. Are you here, Moe? No, I just left. Oh. Get out of here. Next time watch where you're throwing. Oh, yeah? Well, I know what, uh, my rights are-- [GASPS] [GASPS] We'll get you. Ha-ha, you missed me. Ha! Ah, that one got you. Serves you right. By golly, he didn't miss me. Oh, now wait! Don't you throw that! Don't you throw-- I say, what goes on here? Let's get him. Oh! Oh! Oh! W-What in the world--? We recovered your painting. There's the crook that stole it. My painting! My painting! You boys are wonderful. I'll get you a nice reward. My painting. Oh, boy, a reward. Won't Shemp be glad to hear this? He certainly will. Hey, where is that puddinghead Shemp? That's got it. Now to get out. [♪♪♪] Moe! Larry! [♪♪♪]
