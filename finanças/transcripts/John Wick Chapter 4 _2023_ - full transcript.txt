I am always. Into the city world. I am the way into which. I am able to go on the laws before me. There were no clear scenes, but those that last for how long is 200000. You are about to hundred. The presence of the motherfucking king. You ready, John? Yeah, Mister. A week. To what do I owe the pleasure? My reign, my freedom is gone. Like the elder before me. And if you gave me a thinking, you could end this by killing me. Then you are mistaken. I will not change the outcome any more than you can change your nature. None of us can escape who we are. And no one escapes the table. And the only way John Wick will ever have freedom or peace now or ever is in death. I know. I'm afraid you've come a very long way, but nothing here. Not really. The manager, please. A husband. You seemed to think so. This must be a mistake. There is no mistake. By order of the marquee and simplicity of Grandma, this hotel has been condemned. You have one hour. It is expected that completely. Some decrees signed by the 12 members of the table giving my key awards, have Imparato, which means he is now our judge, jury and evacuated the hotel. That carries on the words. The hangman's noose around his neck were. Such is life. Such is the life. Can you imagine the acceptance that you find? Today is not the day when I of. I'm sure you have the unshakable faith of David, my friend. But you shouldn't be here. This will not be pleasant. Such is life. So. My father used to say. How you do anything is how you do everything. Call it the first and the last rule of life. You will live in rooms, Mr. Manager. Why do I want to have consequences? Of course. And second chances. Are. And that's where we differ. You and I. Second chances are the refuge of men. Who then there are those on the table who blame this atrocity on New York. They believe it's this city that they would as indulge this fucking place for good on. And look what that has gotten us. I shot him. He lives. Polluting everything he touches. Key respectfully in my hotel. Your hotel? If I might. Some, by all means. The Continentals of the management of a reminder to all sit beneath the table that none of us are above the rules. And yet we are here. So, Mr. Wick. We're not here because of John Wick. He is simply the face of your failure, Mr. Manager. Sand in that glass is merely an echo of my remaining patience. You are no longer a New York. You are nothing. Let's go. And as such, you no longer need the services of a concierge. It has been an honor. Should it be? Yes, but it wasn't. You think about why that is. And perhaps one of us would have benefited from this conversation. And then what came? I have a name for you. Respectfully. I'm retired, Mr. Dunn. It is a. I'm no use to you. All the table. That's not for you to decide. I think you should find someone else. Became close to today to close you put in danger. I know that you like a former associate. I believe he was a friend. Agreements with the table stays the same. I give you a name. You give us a life or we take one. I will serve. I will be of service. Excellent. I assume you have a notion away? Might be. John Wayne. Has few friends mean meaning in a world and even fewer. It was with his life. Very, very good. Welcome to the Osaka Continental. How can I help you? I'm looking for a room. I'm afraid this facility doesn't allow animals emotional support. And she is your support all. The way around. First, is it that. She stays in your room? Enjoy. Stay so. I'm not too bad about it. All the. There is a dog in my lobby. I shall support her alone. Of course it is. To our schedule. Mr. Suzuki, at 11 in the thousands, requesting an audience of two. Was decided. To have. Dinner with your daughter. She says she's concerned you've been working too hard. What must I have done to deserve such a considerable child? Good column. Ms.. India. How are our guests? Some of our Gold Club members are anxious. It's always something. Today it's new rules. And my concierge. Concerned. Perhaps we should get you on emotional support of. Just getting. It done. Nothing to offend the table. Relationship with Mr. Blake is no secret. The table will come through. Serious and will be met with our grace. Everything just nice. A minor chancery, no rights, Korean authorities or any company for them. Oh, you know, please tell my daughter. That I look forward to our dinner. I waited, sitting. On your knees, kept on. Apparently not getting kidding. Deal. That was a mistake, my friend. Their response was the destruction of the New York continent. My daughter fears we are next Wednesday alive. But they executed his concierge. To prove a point. Have you given any thought to where this ends? The table will never stop. You know, this. It only takes life and only gives death. Koji, Very soon. Friendship means little when it's convenient for. Welcome to the Continental. How can I. Help the manager. Put for you? Of course. Just make yourself comfortable. He likes to tell me how. The only path this leads to his death. I'm going to kill all. I believe you will try. But no one, not even you, can kill everyone. You want to die. That's your choice. A good death only comes after a good life. You and I left a good life behind. Long time ago, my friend. For the high table. What is he doing? Mr. The is our guest. I'll talk to them. They don't know you're here. They go stay. With the mystery. Because I'm on television. All the. That's what you all welcome to the Osaka Continental gentleman. How may I view the service? The table has reason to believe that this facility is providing services which Cui excommunicated. That is a grave accusation. We will require full access to your hotel. Of course. But as you are well aware, no business, Not even your kind of business may be conducted on continental grounds. So I'm going to have to ask you to surrender your firearms. We speak for the monkeys. And I speak for succor. Your guns. Please don't repeat the mistake that fully. New York Me. Fools talk. Cowboys is silent. Wiseman, Listen. So which one will. You be true? You. Hello. Old friend. So good of you to visit after all these years. You are with them now? No, No. Your daughter, Mia alive. And your daughter Killer. Well, I'm glad. To know we don't have to end this with blood. Leave. No one defies the table. I remember once you understood that. I remember a time when you understood the. Meaning of brotherhood. Enough. By order of the mountains. The moment Peace Hotel has been consecrated. Step aside. Don't do this. You. Sorry. London is down on the top ten. You know your money.

They told my brother Malcolm. Oh, my dear Winston, your benevolence is touching. But tell me. Tell me the truth. Why did the Frenchman let you go? Your man can turn him into a martyr wearing a red around the world is a coward who returned home. So what are you going to. Fail to see how a wasted continentals it's getting you closer to killing the job, Which. Is gang bangers? Not a good deal in general, Mr. Cue the idea of John Wick. And to do that I was Destroyer. Everything that idea touches. The bloodshed in a shock. It's not necessary. The bloodshed. What's the point. When it comes to. You? Make it your choice. You come with me. And twice before accepting. And you are nobody quite. Is this the nobody is a pathetic trade, a miscalculation in which by trying to hide away you go. We let it appear stark naked. I realize only once. Oh, Were you able to locate him? And I'll tell you. How much would such a service be worth? 25 million. Plus a metric contribution to my 401k. What is that we found in was if I never get that before or after, he puts you in the ground like you, 20 million, I guess. More 23 Ego is dead. Nobody is 23 and clearly. Can afford it. Well, this is.

They will replace him before the body is called Achilles. Hades Hydra. You had the table. Have you run out of bullets before they run out of heads? Kill him. But you were the smart way to get him to kill you. You feel how journey's rules and consequences against him Challenge him to single combat on table. Two months are missed from a cold, hard fact and part of the foundation of the table. Two selfish, more combustible members of our road war. It's also where a lose what you say you want a way out? I don't sit at the table. Your family does get them to issue the challenge and then offer you up as a proxy. I don't have a family. Just room to them to Now I suggest you get your ass to Berlin and get it mended or break a plot. What do you get out of this, Mr. Wood? You were so good at getting Jonathan revenge last night. You really are. Starting. So you should use more of those. Shoes. A lot of the wash soup, meaning there's no backbiting dripping through. My suit. When I speak. He's in Berlin. Of the Rusk aroma. Think I wanted that finder's fee? Now? No kids, I work for you. Get your. I want him part of our deal. The deal was for your service. And it's our life. For life is to nobody goes Oh, yes.

It It does doesn't closure Chris Nolan over Raymond. And you noticed me but I think. You are forgetting we are still under the table. I must, I checked. You are excluded. I think it was talk. You have no business with us after the we shot be there is dead After you put a bullet in the other's head. The is had one bullet in builder's hand in fine Russian tradition. He sent us the bill Because of you I had to kneel in front of the man who murdered my father. We common enemy. We can help you learn. You can't even help yourself. How the hell are you going to help us? By showing this court. She. They just appointed another. You will need to go in the. Dust if I can. I never saw your hair so continuously. The things you wish to succeed will bring. It will. Mother will choose. In you and you will do. How many did you kill to get out? Oh, Lord.

Had guns first. Then we took bring proof of death. You owe me the way is. There no way Gloves will take you. I am so glad, John. I am still your mistress Since I have ordered by this gesture and that of forward to our continuing partnership and is that John. Vick in simpler if. You step up okay. That must be dismissed. Yeah. And they are my. Meniscus, I think is the big you are expected of me in John my life come. You I've been here I suspected it. Family. That family sold you out Mr. Big gave you up. It's a vain hope of saving themselves. You see, That's why I never trusted Cossacks. I did it. People. This person. I sense danger here. Mr. Wig may probably feel responsible for the death. Of a mutual friend, but I didn't kill Koji. Even dear John, you know this discord between our friends. It saddens me and love me to have died. We have a deal. Had the monkey. And I thought that night, if you put it that I. I blamed bad husband and growls and different. This is for me. Mr. Nobody. And no. It's actually for. Him and for. Center exceeds Mr. Nobody and the exciting yeah it so. You want to get him you want to kill him. I want to kill him. And what about your mistake? I am going to kill you. Oh, for bad. Of course you are right. It looks like we have ourselves a genuine conundrum, a quandary, if you will, out of the life dilemma. Oh, so I thought we play a game. One that decides who lives and who does not. And. And I was to buy more than you can afford from one bullet away from being a very rich man. What did fun five control Mr. Big Mr. Big Dead Man's end. Mr. Big Well. I don't gamble. Let's see. Four lines and a four most impressive slash. Pretty good for nobody. Thank you. And linemen. And the guy is a dog. And John bag full control of TV seat. That's a table so that it sounds like the beginning of a stupendous joke. Or most profitable opportunity. One thinks he can serve his buyout One thinks he can buy his way out and one thinks he can be on his way out. Each of them all thinks that they have a him. But what they fail to realize. Is that the moment they took a seat at the table. They had already lost. Let me guess, five been kind. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, God. Got time. Yeah. Oh, God. God. John, just so you know that it wasn't personal. Maybe a little bit. Jim, You know? Oh, yeah, I know you guys was out on the down on the floor and she's at the start of the, you know, you're. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you do. Oh, we've all got. Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah. And you, yeah, yeah. That's a problem. You are lucky you are lucky. I It's all right. Sure you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Maybe she by across my divide. Get it to my boy. Via in my ass. She's in the proposal of what's the point of any. Yeah. The Ruska Roma will support your challenge Who will be your second man? Warning of the cost of tyranny. You must intend to join your guns. Yes. Not today. The old ways of the old. Those John Wick calls you to do to sell your differences the old fashioned way as gentlemen. Sure. Because you're always as if you know them. A man of Mr. Exterior cannot issue such a challenge. He has his family's clenched. Berlin, Moscow. Rome would challenge the acceptance of Mr. Wood back into the fold. It's all there. Recorded history now. And why would I observe this from a second rate seat? Because there were rules. And without them. We live with the animals. Exactly. Oh, times are changing. A new day is dawning. New ideas, new rules, new management. Yet you will accept because we all still see beneath the table. Even you are not immune to the consequences of. And what exactly how is the works? As does. Victoria Fiduciary. The unconditional release of any and all obligations to the table. History is littered with marquees who are only remembered by the servants. But you you could be remembered as the man who brought John Wick the most feared of all by the table, who said it into the light. Your life and who could predict how high that kind of glory could take A man. In our room to know. That offend to discuss wounds. You may go. When I'm done. As you secured your opponent. His victory. My excommunication. Who is to be lifted, my title restored, my hotel rebuilt and re consecrated all of the tables. Expect. Of course. This was a vision. How you do anything is how you do everything. Now I'm done. I think I'll miss you. And ergo shame. I can't hear you say you don't know. Do. What's that? And then second, like a sponsor either walks out with a champagne or is buried beside a They always. Such as live. Under the old laws. Only one can survive. We both understand that. Very good rules. The challenge chooses first. So rise. Now Sunrise, location. You come in thinking there is a way out of this world for you was to weak or is not the strong. Self-Critical. Sector could weapons. If you win. The table will honor as well. I will have your freedom but you won't take its place. This is. Dueling pistols, 30 paces. In the event that both parties survive, each will approach the other at increments of ten paces until only one remains. Rules of engagement. No, no court. You know why you won't take your freedom and because this is who you are. We've always been. You are a killer, an orphan, plucked from the street and thrown into a knife. And it is the killing that gives you purpose. A man with without purpose is nothing. No quarter. No quarter. If there is nothing else, gentlemen. A nomination. It is his right. Do you have a name? Okay. So the sunrise, Sacred Core, dueling pistols. No. Quarter to. Mr. will be victorious. It will be free of any and all obligation to the high table. And the second will be reinstated as the manager of the rebuilt New York Continental. So the marquee, Vincent beside the Grand Mobley, victorious. John Wick will be dead as well as second. Just so now, if there is nothing more, gentlemen, I will see you at sunrise. Failure to meet at the appointed. Our results in forfeiture and immediate execution. There is no run out there, no habeas van. A normal life. There's only John Wick. The killer, and he is going to kill me. And. And your hotel? Yes. You always. How many times doesn't everyone? That's fine. Save up before Scott. There's something I need to do first. Sooner rather than later we'll do it. You fight your own fight. Isn't this what you want, Victoria Fiducia, You kill him and you and your daughter will be free. No one can touch her. If you don't, she will have to face the consequences. The choice is yours. And John. Same advice, same about you. Think your wife can hear you? No. Why bother. Leaving? I'm on. The debt. I call only the living matter. After my daughter was born. I want to leave this life. I thought I did. But you didn't. Would damned you and I. And then we agree. My daughter's not. It was between. You and her. You're going to die. Maybe not. I missed you, John. It's so good to sit with a friend. I'll see you tomorrow. This is you. Resolve the situation well with the baby feel You shake the foundation of the high table and it will turn which. Into a set. My victory will do the opposite. My cleaner grandma. A man's ambition should never exceed is worth. We would do well to remember. That, sir. To raise a small dream of. Your son.

The three types of men in this world must have something to move from. Those who have something to die for and those who have something to give for John Wick, as none of these things is but a ghost in search of a graveyard for the blind man of. Yes, all three.
