Madagascar! Madagascar! Maszek! Maszek! Tomasz, come home! Maszek! SHIVERS camera Screenplay and director - Grzesiu, would you like some preserves? - Yes, please. You know where to find them. - Is anything wrong? - No, it's nothing. We were supposed to go for a walk. - I know. - Well... I am old enough to have... The other thing is that he tucked up his legs. You say that he tucked up his legs, but I just don't get the joke, if I may say so. Please, don't explain anything. - Would you like anything? - No. - Leave it! - Get lost, you brat! Mean ass! You won't fool me. - May I? - Yes. No! Holy Jesus! You idiot! Just look! I have always tried to show you what good there is in life. Warn you against evil. I thought I'd never have to punish you. And I never did. Now... Now I have to change my mind. You'll drink a spoonful of train oil each and you will go to bed without dinner. And now go bathe! - Am I allowed to splash? - No. Do something about it. Mom doesn't know anything. What doesn't mom know? - That you're so stupid. - You are stupid yourself. Am I? You'll come to regret it. I will drown now and you'll be cooked in tar by devils in hell. Fool! And no devils will cook me in tar. Get out! Get out! Get out! Stupid! Get out! Looney! There many kinds of flies in Lithuania - There is among them a separate species called the noble flies. No devils will cook me in tar! At what time are you going to work tomorrow? In the afternoon. - Will you take the boys for a walk? - I will. And will you take me with you? Maybe. Madagascar! No, no, no - it's my turn, Malgosia. - I'll give ten. - No. Take the knife. No. Because youth... Because youth asks not the age, to a youth each woman seems but a girl. To a boy each beauty seems a peer. And to an innocent... Each lover a virgin. And to an innocent... "Master Tadeusz", you idiot, is our greatest patriotic poem. Repeat. "Master Tadeusz", you idiot, is our greatest patriotic poem. Tadeusz, although he almost turned twenty, and from his childhood had lived in the big city of Vilnius, was supervised by a priest who watched over him and brought him up according to the severity of ancient mores. Tadeusz brought thus to his native land pure soul, lively thoughts, and an innocent heart. But also quite a hunger for fun, he planned in advance to taste in the country the freedom he had been forbidden for so long. He knew he was handsome, he felt young and sturdy. From his parents he inherited strength and health. When the rest of the world drowned in blood... When the man, the god of war... When the rest of the world... I've had enough of all this! One should not beat up kids! Oh, man, if thou couldst know thy power, when a thought in thy head like a spark in a cloud shines invisible. If thou couldst know that with a single thought thou shalt light up like a thunder the elements wait in silence, and so the devil and the angels wait for your thought. What was that? - We haven't discussed it. - And rightly so. I am not allowed to teach it. But it is your duty to know it, Poles. Fail. - And you? - Dziady Part Three. - Very well. Have you read it? - I have. And you're not allowed to, unfortunately. Fail. People, each of you, alone, imprisoned by thought and faith, may overthrow and raise thrones. Back to your seats! Czarek, come back! I said, take your seats! Negroes! What fun we had with the blacks. Catch him! - Oh, bloody hell! - Tadziu. - You have guests. - You're lying, jerk. Let me go! Let me go! Son Of a bitch! I'll kill you! - Wzdychu, give it to me! - Are you mad? Tadziu! Just look at yourself. Tadziu, lock me up. One, two! One, two! Right leg! Right hand! Joyfully! Evenly! Joyfully! Smiles on your faces! One! One! One, one, one. Wave your scarves! Joyfully! All of you, joyfully! Evenly! Left foot first! What are you worried about, Wzdych? Stop! Music stop! Stay where you are! Music stop! Stop! - Music stop! - Stop! Stop! Stop! Fall in! As your class tutor I have to talk to you. Because of your lunacy, your colleague Bajerski ended up in the hospital. And an exemplary teacher was forced to leave our school. Why? Because some asshole felt like crawling onto the facade. And you and you will see me after classes. What for? I'm not coming! - What? - My father is a police officer! Do you know how much I care for your father? As of today I take over the classes in Polish literature. We shall start with "Master Tadeusz". Any questions? About turn! To your class! Three, four! Avanti! One, one, one! Three, four. Come on. As you probably know, I formally represent the department of education, but I came to you privately, as a friend and advisor. I shall not mention the recent events. You know what I am talking about, don't you? You're silent - it's OK. We understand each other without words. But I have a private question. Which of you goes to church? Well? I asked you a question. So which of you? Sit down. It's OK. It's OK, that you're so courageous. This is what I wanted to talk about with you. Courage. It characterised only the best: Zawisza Czarny, Kosciuszko, Pawel: Finder. And us? And you? The hope and future of this country. Tell me straight up: Can you do it? Do you have the courage to say “no” to your parents this coming Sunday, and say "yes" to your conscience? Learn, broaden your horizons, go to the movies, rather than to church. - Can we play ball? - Naturally. Football is a noble game. I play it quite often myself. Sit down, what's going on! Quiet! Quiet! What is it?! Sit down! Take your seats! Right now! What is it? Take your seats, please. - Sit down and be quiet. - I am so clumsy. But as you can see, I have the courage to admit it. I know what you mean to say: parents. Who farted? It can happen to anyone. So - parents. Consider whether it is better to break free from parental control or to lead your country towards darkness and superstitions. You - citizens of a free country, Poles. So will you have enough courage? Hip, hip, hip-hip! It's nice - hip-hip. This Sunday we intend to help local farmers. Thank you. Goodbye. Your presence is obligatory. And now I'll ask again: who farted? What a pig! Throw it. Thousands of armed units... Prof! They're coming! Let's get to work! Right now! Quickly, prepare your scarves! Work! Don't look around! Quickly! Work! Dig and pile them up! Hurray! The flag! Wave your scarves! Let's run! Hurray! Fall in! Avanti! Avanti! Three, four! Where are the weapons? I surrendered it in my unit in March. - What kind of weapon was that? - Mauser. Well. Profession. Madagascar. Take your seats, please. To learn, fight and work - be prepared! Be Prepared! Sit down. As you probably know our school has been awarded. Two of our students will represent our town at the Central Scouts Camp. The girl guide came to take a closer look at you. Headmaster, please. Tadeusz Krzywanski, Wieslawa Gados, Roman Tylman, Tomasz Zukowski - stand up. Who of you would like to take part in the camp? But first you'll have to pass an exam. So who will it be? Bravo. - Are you a good student? - I am. And you? One must be courageous. He can't leave. He has to look after his mother. She is sick. The doctor said she needed to be looked after. I believe you. Why do you get so nervous? It is quite commendable. Remember: each has only one mother. And now the next candidate. - What happened? - I slipped. Let's listen to what this klutz has to say. Well. My clad is in prison. What are you doing? I'll show you! What are your grades like? - Mediocre. - He's my best student. He should go to this camp. We must give him a chance. Silence, scumbags! Dear colleague. Excuse me. It really wasn't me who suggested the candidates. I believe you. I will take him to the camp without the exam. He has a strong personality, doesn't he? Well, yes... It's true. I think you'll like it there. Don't cry, Maszek. Mom, did dad do anything wrong? No. What a horrible time. Mom, I don't want to go there. You don't have to. We'll get by somehow. Eat... It's good for your health. Breakfast, Maszek. Sit down. - Has anything happened? - No, nothing. - I won't eat this shit! - How can you say so? Eat! - Eat. - People, help! - Help! Help! - Mom. - Mom. - Yes? I'll go there. Dad, deluge! Deluge. Run! Run! You should shit in the morning, clear children. You should beat your meat at night, to give it real might. - Be prepared! - Be prepared, leader! Breakfast in fifteen minutes. Get dressed. Why are you standing like this, dwarf? I... I need to use the toilet. You need to piss or shit, scout? - Shit. - Shit? You're welcome - lavatory number 4. You'll see, you'll be late. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us, and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us... I'll be on duty tomorrow. Be Prepared! Be Prepared! There are quite a lot of books here, right? Well. But not for you, dwarf. They write various things in these books. Come. Come on. Do you believe in God the Almighty Father? I do. Don't admit it. I'll show you something. Watch out, someone may rat on you. You're not allowed here. Is your father in prison? YES. - Be prepared. - Be prepared. - Be prepared! - Be prepared, leader! Once more, louder, evenly: be prepared! - Be prepared, leader! - Sit down. Now according to our tradition the president of the camp council will say a few words. The floor is yours. Welcome to our camp, scouts from all over Poland. We will work and learn together for three months and we'll certainly get to know each other well. - Are you good at history? - What? I asked if you were good at history. Not too bad. - Will you help me? - Hush. A school of citizenship and politics. - Because I am not too good at it. - It is meant to leave a lasting mark and guide us in our future lives. When we come back to our schools, teams and homes, we will be obliged to take part in various school and district councils. We shall soon join the Polish Youth Association... - Go on. - And the most true to the Polish United Workers' Party. In the future we shall be state and party officials... Jews or state farmers? - What is it? - Provocation! Let's go! Catch the provocateur! Catch him! Faster! - Stop! - Stop! This is a scouts' camp, not a training camp for commandoes. And I think that they behaved perfectly well. And I am proud of them. Comrade, this is sheer stupidity. Attention! At ease! It was your duty. I am proud of you. Be Prepared! Be Prepared! There were many victims. Hopes were often clashed. Many of those who succeeded remained in America permanently. There were many victims. Hopes were often clashed. Many of those who succeeded Who wants to join photo club? Tomek! Tomek! Do you want to join the photo club? - Yes, please. - Done. - And you? - No, I already belong to the buglers and the art club. As you wish. Who wants to join the photo club? Dear mom, it is my third day at the All Polish Scout Camp. I feel well, only my stomach hurts constantly. Scout Tomasz Zukowski! Why didn't you chase the provocateur, scout? - I didn't know. - You didn't know? And scout Dominik knew, didn't he? - Dominik was awarded. - Awarded? They put you on the red board, - and he's on the black one. - Bullshit. Wait. How did you know it was a provocateur? He behaved against... - Against the regulations? - Exactly. Seems simple but scout dwarf didn't know it. Do you think that there are many provocateurs? - My father says there are many. - Very many? Very many. And communists? Father says that real communists are not as many. Does it mean that there are more provocateurs than communists? YES. " Yes! Scout! You dropped it. Thank you. They can kiss my ass. Unless my father has already lost his job. Scout! Was it Madagascar? You know it. Be prepared then. - Are you going with us? - Where to? Do you want to take him? - Have you got money? - I do. How much? 20 zloty. OK. It'll end up badly. If anything happens, I knew nothing about it. If anything, I knew nothing. Now, dwarf, Listeners' Choice. ...in old workers' uniforms they have been standing for almost two hours. From the windows of the building in Kochanowski street the first shots were fired. One of them hit a 13 year old boy in the head. This was the way Romek Strzalrkowski was killed, Listeners' Choice. 13 year old scout who went shopping to help his ailing mother. He was one of the 12 underage victims of the Poznan June Events. At the exit of Kochanowski street a tramway was toppled over and made into a barricade. Dispersing protesters were hit by bullets shot from the buildings of the Secret Police. What I know about my parents. The title of the essay. - You. - Me? Tell us what you know about your parents. We want to get to know you, your parents: who they are, where they work, whether they are party members, who are their friends. My parents... Dad works for the police, he is a sergeant, - but he doesn't wear a uniform. - Why? Dad has special tasks. But he likes his job. He used to be a locksmith but he prefers being a policeman. Why so? He earns well and mom doesn't have to work. And this is it? You probably know nothing about your father. Tylman, what would you add? I think that my colleague's father likes his work because he strengthens the power of the people. Very well. Repeat all the sentence. My father likes his work because it strengthens the power of the people. - You see. - Excuse me. Don't interrupt. And maybe you'll tell what your parents do in their free time. Father sleeps and mother prays that they'll kill dad. I don't get it, what do you mean kill him? They shot at clad but he escaped. - And then he got a medal. - What medal? For courage. And now you'll write the whole truth about your parents. It'll be a test. Say it out loud to the class. I think this essay should be treated as a test of our characters and veracity. - What is your name? - Scout Dominik. Distribute these. You have auxiliary questions on these sheets of paper which you should answer. - Excuse me. - Yes? What shall we write in answer to "political views and foreign contacts of our parents"? You have an explanation further on. What do you want? - I have to leave for a moment. - Be back soon. For next Saturday you will write an essay about one of your colleagues from the camp. Everything you know about him. A scout does everything to make the work of his team... - Name. - Yield better results. Scout Tomasz Zukowski, temporarily released from classes. You may go. Don't come in here! There'll be a mess everywhere. Dad! Deluge! Deluge! Dad! Now, now. - Now, now. - Pig! Here you are. Do you know, scout, what the Colonial League was? No. And what is this? It is my stamp - Madagascar from 1937. And you brought with you only one stamp? - I did. - And it happened to be Madagascar? Well, yes. And what do you know about the colonial plans of pre-war Poland? Nothing. And would you like Madagascar to become a Polish colony? I guess I would. You should read this. It is an essay about you. - About me? - Yes. As you can see some are not quite as lazy as you are. Tell me is it true that you once said: I will never join the PYA (Polish Youth Association) because my father would beat me to death. No, it's not true. I thought so too. And is it true that your mother, when she heard of the death of comrade Stalin said that God finally showed some mercy upon us. Yes, it's true. But I didn't know what it meant then. Seriously. I believe you. - Do you like preserves? - I do. Home made. My mother also makes preserves. You wrote a beautiful letter to your mother. How do you know? This is the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. But you aren't angry with me, are you? No, but it's not right. Maybe. Maybe you don't like it but I think that at our camp correspondence should not be kept secret. We should get to know each other better, understand. At least this is the way I was brought up. I'd like to have a son like you. And now attention! We wipe the portraits dry, don't leave any stains or water. Carefully, carefully. A portrait behind glass is a particularly difficult object. You have to find such an angle for the camera and light, to avoid reflections. Oh, and now take your places and your cameras. Scouts, all the best with your work. But they also write what they want. They slander good communists, scream about the crimes of Stalinism. Can't the party close down such a newspaper? Yes, I know these arguments: close down the newspaper, ban criticism, discussion, strengthen censorship and turn Poland into one big Poznan. Blood, shooting, workers against the party. No, they were not workers - they are provocateurs from the West! They paid them in dollars in, order to spill blood in Poznan! Members of the party, the PYA, students, workers - and call them "provocateurs from the West"? I don't know you, Zbyszek. It was you who taught me that the party was never wrong, that the history was with us. You're right, history is with us. The strength of the party is in its ability not to shrink from responsibility for its errors, it is not afraid to criticize its errors and injustices. This is why Gomulka has already been rehabilitated and he will certainly join the Central Committee. Why did you come here? To destroy me? I came because I loved you. Stop it. Leave me alone! Take your newspapers and go back to Warsaw. What are you doing here? - The door was open. - So what?! - You're lost. - You didn't understand me. She wants the world to be a better place, she wants people to be honest, equal. In no time at all you will be the same son of a bitch as my father. That leader of yours, the headmaster... Anyway, the headmaster - is OK. - Are you mad? No, shorty, I am not mad, they are, and now you as well. You know what? My father will soon be released. How can you know he will ever be released? - Because he is innocent. - She told you that? Yes, it was a mistake. - They made a mistake? - Yes, it happens so. That bitch turned you around. Take it back. Right now! - She made fun of you, dwarf. - You're lying. You're mean! Mean and stupid! Careful. Wait! Not so hard! Enough. Now. Won't he rat on us? No. Abusing the working classes and their hard work, the capitalist gained disproportionately. Abusing the working classes and their hard work, the capitalist - gained disproportionately. - Dominik. Come with us. Listen, are you a true communist? Naturally, what is it about? I think he tells the truth. Does he? Swear that you're a real communist. - So help me God. - OK. It's cool in here. Cool. What is going on? Jadwiga Mlotkowska answered prosecutor Leman. She said: Have you whenever, wherever. Turn up the volume. Said any such words when the officers of the police tortured and murdered in cold blood, with malice aforethought prisoners who were in their power? I'm not going to listen to it! I am asking if it was revealed in what ways... Swine! It's a provocation! Let me go! Let me go! Help! Jurek! Stop it! No... Leave him! Now! Unjustly sentenced are going back to their homes and families. Rehabilitation of further political prisoners is halted by the resistance of the majority of members of party authorities and security forces. We shall never forget violence against Polish patriots. It will look nice but you have to fill in this gap. - And you have to glue it here. - Just a moment. - Be prepared, scouts! - Be prepared. Bravo! Silence! Quiet! Quiet! Listen: when our guests arrive, everyone assumes positions. Let me see it, quickly, a rehearsal. Come on! Tomasz. - Excuse me. - Yes? As some things aren't ready yet, you have to take care of the decorations in the hall. - You're responsible for them. - Be prepared! Attention. Three, four, now! Hands off the Oder, hands off the Neisse, hands off our borders. This is the land of the ancient Piasts - the West is our land. It wasn't the pope who gave us the coast, Neither did bishops own Silesia. Polish soldier spilled his blood on this land this is where our forefathers once lived. Polish soldier spilled his blood on this land this is where our forefathers once lived. Let's sing. We shall not forget how the enemy tormented us, the wounds and the tears... It wasn't the pope who gave us the coast, Neither did bishops own Silesia. Polish soldier spilled his blood on this land. Let's sing. This is where our forefathers once lived. Polish soldier spilled his blood on this land this is where our forefathers once lived. What are you cutting? The exclamation mark. - Let me see it. - What for? Let me see it. They're coming the day after tomorrow, aren't they? It hurts. I wanted to let you know that when the best sons of this country through their intensive work and learning give their socialist fatherland all their effort, subversive elements with the assistance of western imperialists have begun their subversive activities in our country. It is our organisational duty to show heightened vigilance. We will staunchly oppose the imperialists and the subversive elements! Be Prepared! Be Prepared! Attention! At ease! Excuse me, leader! Excuse me, leader! What is it going to happen now? Do you like me a little? Very much. Would you leave me helpless in a difficult moment? No, never. I would also never leave a friend without assistance. Neither would I. Do you know who needs the help the most now? The communists. The workers - the most worthy people and honest, and we also need it. Our organisation and our country to which we swore loyalty. I understand it, I will never betray it. So go to your mom. Be Prepared! Rehabilitation of further political prisoners in our country. The unjustly sentenced are going back home. Where is it? Silence! Due to the difficult situation in the country as of today we shall keep night watch. Each should read the regulations before their watch. In learning, work and fight - be prepared! Be Prepared! You and you will take the first watch. Follow me, please. Who else? Well, well. My name is.,. My name is Tomasz Zukowski. It's my fault. We listened to Radio Free Europe and Dominik, scout Dominik, would not listen. And we forced him to. He cried... Calm down! I believe we have done a mean thing and dishonest one. I should be punished. Who else was there with you? Jerzy Kaminski and Kazimierz Domagala. Stand UP! What are we to do with you? I have already said it: expel me from the camp. Listen, check this. We have other plans concerning you. Your honest speech was very well received by comrades from Warsaw. We are of a similar opinion, anyway. You helped us remove from our ranks dangerous enemies. And it counts. We want you to join the camp council. What do you think? It's unfair! In the morning you will move to your new room. Be Prepared! Speed up. Traitors! Attention! You'll see. Why don't you salute members of the camp council? - I told him off, didn't I? - Well. Now I have to write a report. Scout Zukowski. - Present. - You have a visitor. - Me? - Yes, he's waiting downstairs. Dad. Daddy! I knew they'd release you! It was a mistake, wasn't it? YES. You know, I discovered provocateurs. They seemed friends, scouts, and still they turned out to be enemies. You've grown. A gift from the Baby. - You're not happy. - I am. Maszek, why don't you come back home with me? Now! Now when I have such an important job! Counterrevolution raises its head; the press has betrayed us, we had to ban reading newspapers, and I am supposed to go back home? Listen, I'll talk to the headmaster - he'll certainly agree. Mom will be so glad. Don't you miss home? You just don't understand. We have to start an investigation, and punish those responsible. We have to be stronger. The hand raised against the party must be cut off! Take it to the library. It is forbidden to read it. Mighty God, Almighty God, give her strength and courage. Destroy counterrevolution and our enemies. Assist us in our victory. Enlighten... this fight... ...doesn't make the slightest sense. Who has a scarf still? Look away! Fast! Faster. Who still has a scarf? Don't look, straight and right. Faster. - Come down faster! - Faster! Bloody hell, move on! - Is there anyone from the 2nd patrol? - I am here! Listen, stop pushing! Calm down. Move on. - Move on to the car. - 2nd patrol there. Don't push, bloody hell. Come here, move there. 2nd patrol, get on. Come here. Get on, get on. Move there. Move on, faster. There, there. Run! - Faster, faster. - Move it faster! Be prepared, scouts! Scouts, why are they sending us away? Idiot. Design music
