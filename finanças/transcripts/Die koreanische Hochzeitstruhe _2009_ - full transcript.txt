The styles of Michelangelo, Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci are stored in this computer. Choose your style. - Pick one! - The first! Good, the first one. Relax! Ah, that's how the drawings are done! It doesn't have a colored background! The other one's better, don't you agree? - I like this one. - Shall we take this one? The other one! Madame Kim's wedding salon - No, this one! - Yes. It holds rice for the father-in-law and the bowl for him. The bowl for the mother-in-law. When you return from your honeymoon, cook rice and soup for the in-laws and serve it in these bowls. These are silver spoons and chopsticks. By eating with them, the parents will live healthy and long lives. This is the gift for the bride's mother. A belt for the son's first birthday. The five pouches go in the wedding chest first. If you have a son, the grandmother will use it to make a belt for him. Pink is for the cotton seeds, descendants and family happiness. Yellow beans in the yellow pouch for the bride's gentle character. Millet goes in the green pouch for a fragrant future. Sticky rice in the blue pouch for a harmonious life together and 100 years of happiness. Red beans in the red one, they drive the evil spirits away. These are used for clothes. Ivory and dark blue for the jacket. This is for the outer garment. When you pack the wedding chest do not use an even number. Put in only an uneven number of items because the bride and groom are united as a third entity. Three pieces of fabric go into the chest An envelope for the proposal of marriage in which the groom's father asks the bride's family for their precious daughter. Letter of the four pillars with the birth date of the groom. Today we live by the sun calendar but here the lunar calendar applies. These ribbons of silk are used to wrap the gifts for the wedding chest. They are always blue = masculine and red = feminine. You mustn't make any knots, just loops. The silk is twisted like a rope, without knotting it or fastening the ends, so that the couple has a pleasantly flowing relationship, without any break-ups. First the five grain pouches: pink to the northwest, blue to the northeast, yellow in the centre. Red to the southwest and green to the southeast, all five positions. On the bottom you put the traditional Korean garment. The blue goes in the middle and the red on top. Then everything is covered. Last comes the proposal of marriage and the groom's family tree. The chest is then closed and wrapped in a blue-and-red cloth, blue on the inside, red on the outside. Red for the woman and blue for the man. This is the cloth with which the messenger carries the chest to the bride. It is plaited into a rope. So it can be loosened easily. When the daughter is married and gives birth to a child, the mother gives her the cloth to make diapers out of it. Everything in the chest can be used. Nothing should be thrown away When I go to paradise I will take everything with me: marriage proposal, family tree, cloth, ribbons of silk and wrapping paper. At the funeral ceremony everything is burned. In the past, for a second marriage there was no marriage proposal, no chest... Only the first wife would receive that. Now with the diaper cloth the chest is made ready for carrying. No knots - everything has to come undone easily. The chest is then sent to the house of the bride. It cannot be opened again. Therefore this seal is applied. Only the bride's parents are allowed to open the chest. Now the rope is properly looped. The straps, known as the "rider's reins", gently sway back and forth. When the bride's family receives the wedding chest, the rice pot is brought forth and the chest is set down upon it. Like this. The "rider's reins" hang behind, and the seal comes to the front. Mother and father sit here, where I am now standing. That's it. Move forward in one fluid motion. Don't put the chest down, until you reach the bride's house and the pot of rice. Make the grand ceremonial bow. Street of wedding shops The return gift Street of printers Street of medicinal herbs This tea is made from three herbs, Ginseng, O Mi Za, Maeg Mun Dong.
