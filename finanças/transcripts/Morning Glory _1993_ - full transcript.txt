May I have a look at the local newspaper? You're new to these parts, aren't you? Yes ma'am. May I sit down and read a little? Yes, of course, sit down ... Would you like some coffee? And how much is a cup of coffee? 10 cents, fresh coffee. No thanks, no. Yes, yes, I saw. Looking for a husband, in health, age does not matter, working, E Dinsmore, Hani Run District. Take your brother and go to the house, quickly. There you go. Take your brother and go to the house. Stay in the house, okay? How can I help? I am looking for Dinsmore's house. You found him. Sorry, I came by ad. By ad? Looking for a husband. I posted it. Thought so. There are three of us, almost four. I thought so. The economy must be brought into a divine form. Interested in listing? I think yes. Then take off your hat so I can better see you. Nice hairstyle. Yes ma'am. I'm Eleanor Dinsmore, Mrs. Glenda Dinsmore. Will parker. Have you been here a long time? A little more than a day. - Where did you live? - At the mill. Worked for Harvey Overmile? He's a scoundrel, better work for me. I gave this announcement about three weeks ago, and you are the first to come to such a wilderness. Whitney calls me crazy, you know that? No ma'am. Therefore, you have not yet escaped. Maybe you should run away. Why? I was in prison. And why were you sitting? I asked to take off my hat so that I could better examine you. Imprisoned for the murder. “Did you really kill?” - Yes, ma'am. Was this a good reason? I thought so at the time. Mr. Parker, will you kill me too? No ma'am. Are you sick, Mr. Parker? Sorry... Everything is fine. But you got sick! Probably all because of green apples. What kind of apples? I had lunch with apples. So you had to think before you eat. When hungry, there’s no time to think much, ma'am. So you didn’t have dinner? Let's go to the house. I'll cook something for you. This is Donald Wade, hold the baby. Hi Donald Will you be standing in the doorway, Mr. Parker? No ma'am. Mr. Parker, the house is small, but I would be grateful if you took off your hat. Sit down. And this is baby Tom. He's almost three ... And this one will be in time for Christmas. Where is the father? In field. I buried him there. I thought... You do not agree on an offer, get rid of it. I thought their father just left many fathers began to leave when depression began. Then I would not look for a new husband, right? Of course not. Glendon would never have escaped. I couldn’t. He could only escape into his dreams. How long has he died? Do not worry, children from him. “I didn't mean that.” - What about? I watched your eyes as soon as you appeared at my doorstep. He died in April. He was killed by his dreams. Bees and honey ... What do you think to do? Why aren’t you afraid of me? “Maybe I'm afraid.” “But you are not sure.” Should I put all the cards for you? Are you afraid I was afraid when I saw it. Then I will go where I came from. Do you want to leave? No, ma'am, probably not. Want to live with the rest and think I'm crazy? This is true? Little. The way I live, real madness, right? I see you need help, you have children, a large economy. Do you like children? I don’t know, I didn’t play with them often. Think better, there are many of them, and they may bother you. And I won’t let you beat them, okay? These are the children of Glendon, and he would not dare to do so. I give you my word, I won’t do it. Here is what I will say. I love my husband. And I would not look for another, if not for the current situation. Winter is coming, I'm pregnant. And yet, I have three children who are not even five years old. Do not get me wrong, I love them and I don’t need children anymore. Ma'am, I need only where to spend the night and food. You can spend the night. In the morning you get up, take care of the household, and sleep in the barn. You are very kind. And wash yourself. - What? - Nothing. Then wash your face. Apparently, you have been sitting for a long time. Have you washed your face with warm water for a long time, Mr. Parker? Five years. “Have you been in prison for five years?” - Yes, ma'am. I think soap comes in handy for you, Mr. Parker. Thanks. You are no longer in prison, Mr. Parker, there are many soaps. As well as water. Rice, turn it on, this is my favorite song. I did not come here to go deaf. Yes? Why did you come here? I will walk around the house all night and your heart will tell me everything. From you, a man is better than Chinese arithmetic. That's for sure, sugar. Yes... God, you wanted to fuck me right now, right? I'm ready. - Feel it? - Yes. As soon as I thought about you, the nipples immediately swelled. Yes... Come here... Lula, would you turn off your heater. I need a real fan ... it freshens the air, moves backward, forward ... Lord ... I saw one in Atlanta when I went to my sister. Yes, I bought you a refrigerator, a meat grinder, turned your cupboard into a bathroom. And I said thank you. Yes, but I need to talk to May about where my money is going. Rice, if you don’t buy me a fan, then I will find someone who will buy it for me. You know that, look for such a fool like me in this town. Well, I don’t know, today some guy came to the city. Yes. For me he is a complete idiot. - Such a tall guy? - Yes. Was he wearing a big cowboy hat? Exactly. He was fired by Harvey Overmine, his name is Parker. He served 5 years in prison for killing whores. - God ... - In Texas. - Can not be. - Maybe. What did he need? He went to this crazy Ellie about the announcement. How do you know that? He asked me where to find her. - Ally Dinsmore? - Yes. She advertised her husband, Lord. What did you want? She has been sitting in her house all these years. She's crazy. Your heart... My heart will tell you everything ... Oh my god ... Maybe this is not the best place to sleep, but still. And I do not blame you for your words. “And I don't blame you, Mrs. Dinsmore.” “Be careful here.” - Yes, ma'am. - Here, take it. - Watch out. - Sorry, sorry. So. Everything is fine. Sorry to be so modest. All perfectly. And you are not very strong. Really? But I threw a blanket. Barely. Hold on. Do not be silly. I walk this barn before you bought this so-called hat. The wealthier, the glad, as they say. Take it. Leave it to yourself ... Watch out, Donald. Milk goats? “No, just a cow.” - Is there a cow? - Herbert. - Herbert. Look, this is Madame. Wow. Jump over? Well done. Do not plunge into the mud, do not rush, Donald Wade. - You just look. - A pile of iron. Glendon loved collecting pieces of iron, just like his father. Can I ride? Of course, baby. Will you take Thomas with you? Take his hand. Come on baby Thomas. “This is Father Glendon’s car.” “Not in very poor condition.” Lord Lord - It's okay, come out. - Help them! Let's! Quickly in the mud! In the dirt! Don’t worry, that’s all right. Like this. Well done. - How are you? - Not bad. - Like this. - You do not have kids? No ma'am. - Weren't you married? - No, ma'am. Surely shiver in those wet pants. I’ll dry it later. We have a hole. - Sorry, sit here. - It's okay. Come here, hold on, come to me, I'm sorry. Mr. Parker, he has not yet learned to use the toilet. Forgive me. The pants were already wet. I will wash your pants, and I will give you Glendon, until your dry. I will be glad. I decided to stay with you if you do not mind. I'm not against. And as for the wedding, then we will postpone it until you are ready, and if you don’t want to get married, then there is nothing to worry about. I will live in a barn. How do you like this idea? Fine. 10, 11 ... Sometimes you can do that. Did you know about that? - Not. - You did not know? Like this. So? Legs next to the hooves, inward. Thanks. Good morning, Mrs. Dinsmore. I'm Goodle, Rice Goodle. Maybe you remember me, my older brother went to school with your mom. I know. Do you have a person by the name of Parker? Yes. I would like to talk to him. He mows the grass behind the house. Mrs. Dinsmore, I don’t want to interfere in my business, but you should know that this guy is on a pencil with the police. If you want to tell me that he was sitting, then I already know that. - Do you know? - Yes. I just wanted to make sure you know ... Yes I know. Thank you very much. Parker? Will parker Rice Goodle, Sheriff. Have you been to Whitney, Parker? About a month. “Have you not been released ahead of schedule?” - ahead of time. Then why don't you visit me? I had to find a job. But you have to report on arrival. I will come. And ... Mrs. Dinsmore knows that you killed a whore? He knows something. And here is what I know. Your best friend put you in jail. I'm not your best friend. Why don't you get out of here? I’m not touching anyone. You already violated the rules of parole. I came here to tell you about this. Here is a great town, good people live. The worst thing that can happen here is that Harvey Overmine will get drunk and climb into the fray ... I hope you catch my train of thought. So, better watch your behavior and don't make me run after you. Because if I want, I’ll put you in jail, do you understand me? Yes, sir. Fine. What did he want? He just... Ma'am, these bees, Did your husband have bee hives and gloves so that the bees do not bite? Somewhere lie. Could you find them? I do not want you to contact the bees. I'm not going to mess with them until I know how to properly care for them. - It's full of honey ... - No. My husband tried to get rich on selling honey. He went to the apiary, I forbade him, the bees began to circle around him. The hive is broken and he was bitten to death ... He never listened to me. I need to go to town to report to the sheriff. Report? I was released ahead of schedule. Do you want to come with me? I do not go to the city. Then I will take the eggs and try to sell them. As you wish. Library Have a library card? No, but I would like to make one. Your name. Will parker. Parker ... Will, your address. Hani Ran. I need some evidence that you live there. I have nothing with me. - Nothing? - Not. Mr. Parker, I'm sure you understand me, I can’t give out books to the first comer, because you do not have any documents. These are the rules. If you want to read, then sit here. “Good afternoon, Miss Beasley.” - Quiet. Sorry, I will speak more quietly. - What are you studying? - Bees. You know, I'm reading about Beethoven. This is a composer. He lived at a time when everyone wore tailcoats and all that. I haven’t seen you for a long time. Where did you hide? Mrs. Dinsmore. Mad Ally? You will ruin your reputation. You are probably bored. If you want to be shown the surroundings, I’m happy to do it. Sorry, but I need to sell the eggs, I'll go. Well then, if you're curious, I work at Vickery Cafe. See you. - Tell me, ma'am. - Yes? I work for Mrs. Gleinsmore can she come to you and confirm that I work for her? Will this be enough to confirm my place of residence? She will not come. - Will not come? - She is a recluse from childhood. However, if she confirms this in writing, then, I think, this will be enough. I will ask her. Mr. Parker. How is Eleanor doing? Fine. She is six months old, pregnant with her third child. - The third? - Yes, ma'am. Lord Say hello to her. Good. By the way, I want to sell eggs. You do not know where they can be sold? I myself would take eggs from you. Yes ma'am. Hold on. Squirrel remembered that she saw a nest in a Magnolia tree, it was warm and ... safe. She climbed in there and what do you think she saw there? Big oak. Right She saw him and realized that she would be better off there. - Hello, Mr. Parker. - Hi, shorty. You were gone for a long time. It was necessary to sell eggs. How are you? I sold everything. Purdy bought a whole tray. The remaining ten I sold to Miss Beasley. Earned a dollar of 20. Miss Beasley said hello. True? The library is a quiet place. So calm. You are right, and it smells good there too. Donald, what do you think I brought? We'll see? What? Look. Hold on. Let's divide in half. Give half to your brother. - Say thank you" . - Hold on. “Thank you, Mr. Parker.” - It's my pleasure. I'm glad you think about them. I had my money, so I bought you something. To me? Lord, how beautiful. Thanks, Will. Not at all, Ally. Maybe we can sell cream and jugs. Are you one of those who love money, Mr. Parker? No ma'am. I think you should not miss the moment to earn some money. - What did you do? - I covered myself with mint. - To remove the smell of a cow. - And where does the cow? Bees hate the smell of animals, they become evil. But you could be bitten. Incredibly, they didn’t put on gloves, they didn’t take a smoke hood! “But you gave me nothing.” “I have nothing to do with it, Mr. Parker!” It was stupid of you! Look what I have done. I did not know that you were so angry. I'm not mad! When they’re not angry, they don’t make noise like that. Put your head in the hive and let them feast on you! - Watch out! - Out! Take it easy! Eleanor, listen to me, calm down. I am not your husband, I am not Glendon, I am very careful. Nothing will happen to me. You have bees, full of all honey, and I will take it to the market and sell it! “I don't care about the money.” - But I do not! Because I would like to do a lot, for example, to conduct electricity. What about the kids? How will you pay the doctor? “I don't have my own doctor.” - And who will be giving birth to you? You. You will listen to me, and everything will be fine. Just cut the umbilical cord. Just a moment! Just a moment! Are you scared? You are right, but you will need to call a doctor who can take care of you. I won’t go to the city, I don’t give a damn about this city, since all of them are against me. - This is madness! - Madness? - I did not want. - Yes. I'm not in that sense. This is risky. What if something happens? I've already given birth to two, you just need to ... I'm not an obstetrician, damn it! Will... maybe you should pack things ... and get away from me. Just a moment, Eleanor. I don’t need you, I can handle it myself. I was not hired to give birth. Glendon has done this twice. This is different, he was your husband. I am ready to get married right now. Yes, children like you, you treat them well. And I don’t often throw eggs. Are you sure about that? Probably. And you? But do not you think that between two people some kind of feelings should arise, or something like that? I like you, but you don't like me? Yes I like you. Then we get married. Yes... May I ask? Ask. Where will I sleep? In the yard is not the month of May. Where Glendon slept. Yes? I sleep with the lights on. I know ok in prison, too, the lights were not always turned off. Well then, then ... I AM... I do not quite know all these rites. Let's get married in Calhoun's court. We will immediately be issued a marriage certificate. Yes? Well, let's go tomorrow? See you tomorrow. In what time? Get up early. Early. Yes ma'am. Let's go. Come on, baby Thomas. Mom, what is a wedding? Will and I will get married. What does it mean to get married? So ... Remember how you come to me at night? Now you won’t be able to come, because Will will sleep with me. True? Baby Thomas, come here. And can we come during lightning and thunder? Thunder and lightning... Wow... - Where did you get the car? - In field. Is this one of those pimps? There are 5 or 6 of them here, I collected one of them. Can't you do anything, Will Parker? Looks cheap. Better shut up, now I just buy it. - Thanks. - Thanks. We must quickly go to court and sign it. I should buy you a ring. Drop your pride. Well... I know. A very strange wedding. - Thank God they survived. - Yes... Good night. - Good morning. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? Yes it's good. Thanks. - I did not interfere with sleep? - Not. But I didn’t interfere? No, everything is okay. You got up quickly. Already... almost 6, you need to milk the cow, otherwise it will explode. I'm tired of your mint smell. Ellie. Mr. Parker! Mr. Parker! Mr. Parker! “Good morning, Miss Beasley.” - Good morning. What a surprise. Did you come from town on foot? Yes, I never had a car. Let's go to the house, Ellie will be glad to see you. How does Mrs. Dinsmore feel? She is no longer Mrs. Dinsmore. She is now Mrs. Parker. Yes, we got married yesterday ... Ellie, look who came. Eleanor, you are grown up. Miss Beasley. The last time I saw you was very small ... and these are your sons. Yes ma'am. Donald Wade. - How are you? - Miss Beasley. This is baby Thomas. Great guys, and another one on the way. You are so lucky, Mrs. Parker. Yes ma'am. Would you like some coffee? I won’t take you much time I brought you bad news but Lewander Sprague, my caretaker for 26 years, died last night. Mr. Sprayg? Heart attack. Such a good person. His life was full of joy Now I am left without a caretaker. They pay $ 25 a week for work. Would you like to get settled, Mr. Parker? Great offer, ma'am. 6 nights a week. Well then, tell me about your decision later. Let me take you back to the city. Thank you for your concern, however, I came myself and leave myself. May I come to you tomorrow? Of course. Good luck, Ally. Congratulations, Mr. Parker. Ellie? Go to work, but I see what you want. But you do not want. Don't be silly, let's go. You don’t want me to go to the city. I have problems with the city, I can’t impose my opinion on you. Just look who I found. You found me reading again. Frankenstein I love healthy men. How is crazy Ally doing? Lord She told you why she is called "crazy Ally"? Her god-fearing grandfather locked her with her mother in the house, because she is a bastard then closed all the shutters and did not let them out. So she didn’t tell you. Ask her somehow. You know, because of men like you, I can't sleep. I think you can’t sleep at night either. After all, your woman is pregnant, why do we need this insomnia. You blushed, sugar. I feel like it gives off from you with heat. So you don't come any closer to me. Some men do not know what they want. Is it worth it, Parker? James, take your finger out of your nose. If you want to poke your nose, then ask permission to go to the toilet ... ... and after ... I apologize, read. “Good morning, Miss Beasley.” “Good morning, Mr. Parker.” “I brought you something.” - Mr. Parker! From our hive. Collected this week. Clean and dark. Ma'am, at the expense of work ... I’m happy to get a job. Then start tomorrow night. Thanks, Miss Beasley. If there is any friction between parents by the time the baby is born this may affect their newborn. I thought you read about electricity. - Read. - Let me see. How to give birth to a healthy baby. Why are you reading this, it's all somehow unnatural. Indian women did this alone in the forest. Can I touch? Never touched a pregnant woman. Of course. Tough, I thought it was soft. He is such as to protect her. I know it will be a girl. I am fat. You're not fat, you're just pregnant. Is coming. Sweet, I love sweet honey. Will you make me breakfast? You will go straight to Huntsville, Parker. I could kick their ass, these bastards. Why didn’t you kick? I let the dog take his bone. So he will leave us alone. There are some problems from the city. People just do not know how to coexist together. Not true. Every time I go to the city, I learn something new. And what? I have to tell you something. I know that your mother was not married. And I know that your grandfather locked you and your mom in the house and did not let you go anywhere. I know what you feel. I know how you feel about the city. But there are people in the city, they are the same as you, like me, no more, no less. Just people. Yes... and they look at you like you're crazy. They whisper, and you hear them say: "Mad Ellie talking to birds and lives in his house with shutters closed. " Crazy mom, crazy grandmother, grandfather. All these people have long died. He made us kneel. He raised his hands to the ceiling, he was shaking, trembling ... his eyes were running. He asked for forgiveness from Jesus ... Mama... Mama... mom closed her eyes clasped her legs with her hands so that they became white ... she swung back and forth ... I was a child of shame for them ... I looked because of my hands ... and thought what I did wrong. It's not your fault, your family did it. These people are no longer alive. No one else will offend you. I have been waiting for this moment for a long time. I thought you won’t want to kiss me. Why? Because I'm pregnant from Glendon. Ellie, you know what I want? I would like this child to be mine. I love you. Nobody told me about this before you. Never. - What? “I love you, Will Parker.” What's the matter? Ellie, Ellie. What's the matter? Go to the barn and bring the horse's reins. - What for? - And prepare the water. Heat the water and set the kettle. - What has already begun? - Please hurry. Lord ... Lord - Where did she come from? - From your mom. She came out of there like a butterfly crawling out of a cocoon. Don, have you come up with a name yet? Come here, I thought about Lizzie, but what do you say? Lizi, like an English lizard. No, just Lizzie. Elizabeth, Elizabeth Parker. Parker? After all, you took birth, you are entitled to a reward. That's for sure. We interrupt our program due to urgent news. This morning japanese aviation struck at the US Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. I repeat, Japanese aviation attacked the US Naval Base at Pearl Harbor. This is Harley with her guys. - Good morning. - How are you? - What happened to your face? - So, I had a fight. If he won’t be able to shoot a pistol, then it will not be of any use. And if you can not fuck heifers. Right You and me. You and I are a single field berry. Ellie, I was thinking ... can you handle it if i go to the army? And my opinion is not taken into account? No ma'am. But you became a father. I will go to the army. How can you think about it at such a time? “You have to promise me something.” - promise? That you will go to the city. And take the boys with you. You have to do this, Ellie. Donald will turn 6 next year, he needs to go to school. - I can teach him myself ... - Listen to me. They must travel to the city. “You must take them to the library.” - I myself ... Do you want them to be smarter than us ?! Let them go to the city, get used to it, to people, because it should be so, Ally. They need to be trained to survive in society, Ellie. Why are you telling me this? The people there are all the same. You are smart, you have smart children. And do not forget what I tell you, no matter what happens. That's better. So really better. I wonder what they need? I don’t know, but we will find out soon. Good morning, Mrs. Parker. Good morning. Do you know a woman named Lula Peak? - I know her. “Did you see her last night?” “Have you seen her?” - Not. She did not come to the library? No one comes to the library after the end of the working day. And she never came to the library after the end of the working day? “Maybe a couple of times.” - Have you come? - When? - About a month ago. “Have you invited her?” - Not. And what was she doing there? You can guess for yourself, sheriff. “So you admit?” “I know why she came.” I know, but she didn’t get it. Are you blaming me for something? I have the right to know. If she accuses me of something, then this is a lie. She came, and I put her out the door. When? When?! - Last night. - Last night? But you said ... I did not want to talk about it, she came after closing. “Have you invited her?” - Of course not. She came, as usual, to strike after me. What happened next? She kissed me, and I pushed her toward the door. - Why did not you tell me? “But I did nothing.” Have you had sex with Lula Peak? Not! What are you getting at? Lulu Peak was killed last night; her body was found on the steps of the library. Lord Is this yours? Answer! You've been in jail for murder. You already know that I have served my term. For the murder of a prostitute in a brothel. Mom, Lizi described herself again. Mr. Parker, I am detaining you on charges of murdering Lula Peak. - Will? - I am not guilty. - Take him away. - Ally. Leave it, do not touch! “I didn't kill her.” - Release him! You know it. Go to your mother, let her take him! Come here. - Release him! - Come to me. Will... Mrs. Parker, take the children to the house. But what will happen to him? Wait, I'll give him a jacket, wait! He needs a lawyer. What happened? Where are they taking him ?! Stand back, she’s going! Step back! Who is this going? God, this is crazy Ally! Dinsmore's wife. - Miss Beasley. - Quiet! This bastard Rhys arrested Will! - I know ... - Help, I need a lawyer. The only person who can agree lives in Calhoun. If I came here, then I’ll get to Calhoun. Are we going by car? Do you still work in the library at Whitney, Miss Beasley? Yes. Please sit down. Do you still hunt turkeys in Red Bown Bridge? It was a long, long time ago. Yeah, sure ... Robert, I brought you a client who really needs your help. If you help her, you will do me a personal favor or rather, help her husband. This is for you. The most delicious honey. Thanks. Where I live, there are many. More pork, chickens, eggs, because now there is a war. I'll give you all the food receipts if only you could help me get Will out of prison. Mrs. Parker, we'll talk about my salary later, In the meantime, I need to decide whether to take on your case. Your jackets. Really they let you in to me. You wanted it? Why didn't you tell me about her, Will? When did she come to the library? If you said, I would not be very surprised at this. You should know what kind of person I am. Go away, I don’t want you to come visit me. Answer me the questions. Yes, I killed this bitch. I need an answer not to this question. You cannot forgive me. And I do not need a wife. Damn it. Just like my best friend, just like him ... He wanted to marry a whore. And he went crazy over her. Ray went to her one night, took her off for a couple of hours. And he asked for her hand. And she just laughed in his face. He got angry, grabbed her, and she pulled out a gun. I took the whiskey bottle and hit it. She never woke up. And since then I have had stomach problems. Lord My friend was scared. And he decided to knock on me. Said we were in love I was going to marry her and get her out of this brothel. And I was to blame for everything ... The jury believed him. And I served 5 years for saving his life. And the sheriff told you that I was guilty, and you believed in it. And saw it in your eyes, Ellie. Do you know how I feel when you look at me like a killer? I'm a man, Will. Well, well, I don't care what you think of me there. Do not say that. Why so? Go home and think about it. Just as I sit here and think about you. Your grandfather always kept the house clean. He is so small and rickety ... Lord, they have grown so much. 2,300. Two thousand... three hundred dollars? This is the highest price. Given the fact that here it will be necessary to make repairs and put everything in order. Just sell it, Mr. Pride, sell it. Parker, your lawyer has come. Lawyer? Your wife and Miss Beasley arrived and asked me to speak with you. I'm Bob Colins. Will parker. Well then, Will Parker, did you kill Lulu Peak? No sir. Everybody get up. The court session begins, the court session is led by Judge Eldon Murdoch. Sit down. State of Georgia vs. William Parker. Edward Slocum, in general terms, we will hear your accusations. I promise that with the help of incontrovertible evidence, I can prove to the jury, despite their doubts, that Will Parker murdered Lulu Peak in cold blood. I asked him to come to the city and report as required by parole. And why was he in prison? I protest, this is not relevant. Rejected, answer the question, Sheriff. For killing a prostitute in Texas. When you arrested Mr. Parker, he admitted that on the night of the murder he was with Lula Peak? At first he denied everything, but I caught him lying. And what was he trying to hide? - I protest. - I do not know. - I protest. - I support. The cause of death was strangulation, wasn't it, doctor? Yes, sir. Dr. Mobridge, as a medical expert, could you describe the state of Miss Peak at the time of death? Miss Peak lay face down at the back entrance to the library. A blue scarf was held in her hand. Dr. Mobridge ... this scarf? I guess this one. Your Honor, I suggest you attach this to the evidence. Dr. Mobridge, have you found any signs of a struggle? Miss Peak resisted? Bruises on her neck, squeezing her hands. Perhaps masculine. And when you did the autopsy, what did you discover? That she was in her second month of pregnancy. Thank you Doctor. Your witness. Dr. Mobridge, is there any way to determine who was the father of this two month old baby? No sir. So this man can be anyone. Yes you are right. I have no more questions. Before the trial, I ask you to allow me to interview this witness later. Received. Dr. Mobridge, you are free. - Mrs. Beasley ... - Miss Beasley. I'm sorry, Miss Beasley. Will Parker worked at your library, right? This is true. And he worked on the night of February 9, when they killed Lulu Peak? Yes. It is true that Mr. Parker with Miss Peak met several times in the library? Mr. Parker worked there, and she came to him. - They were talking? - Yes. Did you hear what they were talking about? No. Were their meetings friendly? Mr. Parker is a polite person. When was the last time you saw Lulu Peak? - Well ... - On the night of the murder? - Yes. “And where did you see her?” I met her on the sidewalk. When was it, Miss Beasley? When I left the library. Thanks, Miss Beasley. Your witness. Miss Beasley, Will Parker rejected the attention given to him by Miss Peak? - Yes. - I protest. The witness has already confirmed that she did not hear their conversations. I support. Didn't he react to her attempts to flirt with him? - I did not react. - I protest! I support. No more questions. Your Honor, I want to ask another question to Miss Beasley. If not against the lawyer ... I ask you to. Miss Beasley, have you ever seen Will Parker carry this scarf with him? These are very common scarves. Answer the question: yes or no. Yes. And did you see him that night when Lula Peak was killed? I'm not sure. You are not sure or you do not want to answer? I protest! The prosecutor puts pressure on the witness. I support. Your Honor, I have no more questions. Are you sleeping? No. My kids love squirrel books. I am very glad. I don’t think they want to get away from Mrs. Marsh. They built such a beautiful hut. They are good boys. And Lizi is simply divine. I miss them. I know. You better live with me. I'm scared, I'm really scared, Miss Beasley. Mrs. Miriam Gauthier, sister in the reception room of Dr. Kendell. Mrs. Gauthier, you just heard Dr. Kendel say that on February 1, he determined pregnancy at Lula Peak. Did you work with the doctor that day? Yes. And did you talk to Lula Peak? Yes. And what were you talking about? I asked Miss Peak where she lives to send a check. “And she gave you the address?” - No, I didn’t. Why? Because she asked me to send a check to this son of a bitch from Whitney's isolation ward. To order! To order! Son of a bitch from Whitney's isolation ward. Thank you very much, Mrs. Gauthier. I have no more questions. Miss Peak check paid? - Not. - Why? Because I did not know where to send him. Thank you, Mrs. Gauthier. You are free, Mrs. Gauthier. Your Honor, the prosecutor will not yet question the witness. Mr. Colins. Protection calls Eleanor Parker. Ellie, over here. Put your left hand on the Bible, and raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell only the truth and nothing but the truth, may God help you? I swear. Sit down, sit down. How long have you known Mr. Parker? He came to me 10 months ago. How long have you been married? 3 months. Are you happy in marriage? Yes, of course, the kindest man. Good father, good husband. When he came home on the night of February 9, did you notice anything strange in his behavior? No. He was just a little worried. Worried? I was worried that he would join the army, and that I would have to take my children to the city. And why was he worried about this? Because everyone knows that I don’t go out into the city. But for the sake of Will you came. - Yes. - Why? Because I love him. When he came home on the night of February 9th, did you notice bruises on his body? No. And any signs of a struggle with a woman? No. Face scratches? Lipstick on clothes? Did he smell of women's perfume? No, there was nothing like that. And what did you do when the sheriff arrived to arrest your husband? I sat on the steps and sheared it. So, until the sheriff arrived, you lived a harmonious, family life? You're right. Your witness. Mrs. Parker, you say that your husband is a good father. Yes. And what was the nature of your relationship with him? - I protest. - Rejected. Answer the question. - Beautiful. - Beautiful? He made me happy. Mrs. Parker, how many men have you had before, intimately? - One. - Your first husband? Yes. Does this really mean a lot? It turns out, except for Will Parker, you only knew Glendon Dinsmore, Ice Cream Trucker. Glendon was a good husband and a good father. And Will Parker is the best man. Clear. Have you made Will Parker happy? I hope so. A man who loved hobbling with whores, did you make this man happy? I AM... It’s true that you are 2 months pregnant from your first husband, when did you marry will parker? Yes. And at that time you had sexual relations with him? No. He was not dejected by this? I protest, this is just a guess! Rejected. He said it was hard for him. Mrs. Parker, based on these circumstances, can't a man seek sexual joy from another woman? Maybe, but not him. But how can we be sure? How do we know your marriage was happy? After all, he likes only women of the night. And he lives on a farm with a pregnant woman and two more children, and you want to say that you made him happy? How do we know that this union was perfect? How do we know, maybe you didn’t even sleep in the same bed with Will Parker! I have his baby. To order! - Are you sure? - Of course, I'm sure. Did you tell the sheriff about this? He did not ask. Really, Nat? I didn’t ask. Gentlemen, you helped me a lot. Thanks. Try my honey. Mr. Macridie, how long have you been retired? 15 years. It’s probably boring to sit for 15 years and do nothing. Nothing to do? To let you know, my brother and I organized a Civil Patrol. We patrol every night, look out for Japanese aircraft in the sky. - Is not it?! - You're right, your mother! To order! A lawyer, a witness must answer questions to the court, and not to the courtroom. Yes, your honor. Do not. So, Maurice, let's talk about your significant work. Have you seen Lulu with men? “Great question, yes, Nat?” - Right! Mr. Macridie! Have you ever seen Lulu Peak with Mr. Parker? She tried to drive him. But she did not have the strength to bewitch him! - I protest! - To order! I support. During your patrol, in the last few months, did you notice any movement near the house of Lula Peak? Not always. Last fall, I saw a car approaching her. And whose car was that? I'm not sure, I just saw in front of the car. And what kind of car was that? - Ford. - Ford? - And what color? - In my opinion, black. Do you remember the numbers? No, it was dark. Stop, if you already considered the brand of car, they could easily see the numbers. In my opinion, PI, Vi, 6, or something like that. Did you see this car near Lula’s house on the night of her murder? No. Thanks, Mr. Macridie. And one more thing, on the night of the murder you didn't notice anything strange near Lula Peak's house or maybe in the city? It seems not. But... What, but, Mr. Macridie? Elroy and Harley parked on Main Street to buy beer, but that’s not at all strange. To order! To order! Your witness. I do not have any questions. You are free. Your Honor, the defense summons Sheriff Rhys Goodle for interrogation. Sheriff, what is your car? Ford Sorry, I didn’t hear. Ford The black? Non PI VI 6? So? All residents know this number: PI Vi 6. How many people can confirm me that you saw how you came to Lula Peak home, how much? I believe that Lula Peak wanted you to pay for her consultation with a doctor. And when she told her sister to give this check to her son of a bitch from Whitney’s isolation ward, she didn’t mean Will Parker, a former prisoner, she was referring to the head of the temporary detention facility. After all, you are a son of a bitch from an isolator, aren't you ?! Lula Peak got pregnant from you, right? Yes... At least he was mine. So she said. But I did not kill her. I do not believe that you killed her. Just like Will Parker killed her. No more questions, Your Honor. - Mr. Slocum? - No questions. You are free. Your Honor, Mr. Dr. Mobridge, under oath, can he answer questions? Let the witness answer. Doctor, you said that death came from suffocation by hands, by male hands. Yes, sir. How many bruises were there on the victim’s neck? How many bruises from the fingers? But, I have to check my report. Of course, but maybe, for example, 9 bruises from the fingers? Well it is possible. So maybe? Yes or no?! I protest! Defense is trying to make assumptions! I withdraw the question and I ask that Elroy Moody go to the podium! It's not me, we got drunk, she left the library in a bad mood. We just wanted to have fun, but she began to resist. But I didn’t strangle her! This Harley did! You did it! You killed her! Harley killed her! What are you talking about, your mother, I will kill you! To order! To order! Mr. Parker, you are free, the case is closed! “Well done, Ally!” - We did it! Congratulations, lady. Thanks, Mr. Colins, thanks. Is it true that Harley Overmine fired you? Yes. “Because you were in prison?” - Yes. Is it true that you lied to avoid being called up? Not true. - Future plans. “Mr. Parker had a hard day.” I don’t even know how to thank you. Thank your wife, she gathered witnesses and saved your life. Will, congratulations. Ellie, Ellie ... I was a complete idiot. I know. Go home? I love you... Listen, when the baby is born, will we call a doctor this time? Maybe, maybe not.
