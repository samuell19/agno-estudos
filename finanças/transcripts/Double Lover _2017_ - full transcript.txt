DOUBLE LOVER - Does it hurt? - No. Are you sure? Yes. Good. You got a little infection. Nothing serious. But pay attention to your weight. If you lose too much, you lose your cycle again. And my belly aches? - Are they back? - Yes, more and more. I can't see anything abnormal, but I can prescribe you an ultrasound if you wish. I think it's more psychological, in your mind. - Could you recommend someone? - Yes. I think I'm ready. Do you prefer a man or a woman? - Miss Fortin? - Yes. Take a seat. Am I the first to talk? If you want. I have belly aches, had them forever. I've tried a lot of diets. I gave up gluten, saw a bunch of specialists, they never found anything. They told me that it's psychological, that the belly is a like second brain, that I said to myself, "Let's see a shrink too." I see. I am 25 years old, I live alone. Well, not completely: I have my cat, Milo. I'm looking for work and it's not easy, makes me stressed. I say the opposite of what I should say. I earned enough money when I was younger, when I was a model, but I stopped. I had love affairs. Nothing special. I'm incapable of loving. Sometimes I feel empty inside. As if I miss something. Sometimes I cry without reason. That's it. Do you think you can do something for me? I think this pain has to do with something inside you. We'll try to find out what it is. I've already dreamed about you. Is that a good sign? I am listening to you. I was pregnant. I don't know by whom, but I did not feel good. I was afraid my belly would explode. I was here, stretched on a gynecological table. You had metal instruments in your hand that looked like torture instruments. I told you to be careful, but you didn't answer, while you were opening out my legs and looking at my sex. I had the impression you were going to rape me. Ridiculous, isn't it? When they took pictures of me as a model, at first it was... exciting. And then it became sad. When I was young, I wanted to be an actress. I wanted to charm, to seduce people around me. Especially adults. My mother's friends. I liked to feel their eyes on my skin, but I did not like them to touch it. I was shy, uncomfortable. I imagined I had a sister. Yes... A twin. A double that would protect me. At 7, my mom told me that my birth was unintended. A one night stand she forgot about, unable to recognize him. Maybe they didn't get on. Maybe he paid her. Like a whore. I was raised by my grandparents. Mom didn't have time. She was a beautiful woman. Free, intelligent. There was no tenderness between us. When I picture her death, her funeral, I feel nothing. In her coffin, it's me I see, dead. Today I don't see her anymore, but I have the feeling she is watching me, that she knows what I think. In my dreams, she looks at me harshly. She judges me. I tell myself she doesn't love me. And that hurts me. Where does it hurt? In the belly. At least this time, you talk to me. When you look at me like this... I tell myself that I exist. - Hello. - Hello. They called me today, I'm busy. Half-time in a museum, quite well paid. Guard. Funny, huh? Funny? Watching people is weird. It's in a museum, not a prison. Thanks to you. You have given me confidence. And, for a week, my stomach doesn't hurt anymore. I'm afraid to heal too fast. - Why? - I think I'd like to... stay fragile. That my pain goes on, and you... And you stay strong. You have nothing to say today? Actually, I feel good. I think I'm happy. Then I think we'll have to terminate our sessions. Did I do something wrong? No. I'm to blame, it's... It's the first time that's happening to me. I experience feelings incompatible with the therapy. - Feelings? - Yes. I'll recommend some colleagues. Excellent therapists. It's not worth the trouble. We should make time to talk about it. It's not worth the trouble. Don't you think you cured me? I think you were my remedy. Goodbye. - That's not for playing. - I'm not playing. - Hello. - Hello. - Is it you who's moving to the 13th floor? - Yes. - Hello. - Hello. I'm on the same floor as you. Very good. I liked a lot the former tenants, but... they had to leave, the lady was pregnant. - Oh, you have a cat! - Yes. What a beauty! How sweet he is! - What's his name? - Milo. Milo, what a beauty you are! - And how old are you? - Seven years. I always loved cats. - I had one, died two years ago. - You should take another. No. Goodbye, miss. Goodbye. PAUL Name: DELORD First Name: PAUL It's me! - Chlo?, are you in? - Yes, I am. - Good evening, love. - Good evening. Your cat surely is comfortable! Come on, move! - Shall I pour you a glass? - Yes. - How was it today? - I was at the hospital. Thank you. It's so different to see people who really suffer... That changes people like me. You are my particular case. - Are you feeling alright? - Yes. Are you sure? It's weird! You know everything about me, and I sometimes feel like I stand in front of an unknown man. That you're hiding stuff. Why do you say that? I found an old passport. - Did you search through my stuff? - I was tidying up. You had a different surname. Delord, I think. Don't you want to talk about it? Sure. It's not important. That's why I didn't tell you before. When I settled in, I took my mother's name. Paul Meyer sounds good! - We said not in the bedroom. - Sorry. He has to get used to it. Come. Come on, move. Paul? Yes. You promise not to hide anything from me? And you not to search among my things? I promise. - Hello. - Hello. Did you sleep well? - No. I had funny dreams. - That's strange, the first night. Especially with an unknown. Listen, I'm getting out. It'll be hard day at the hospital. Good day. You too. - See you tonight. - Yes. See you tonight. - Hello. - Hello. - You can leave. - Thank you. - What did you do today? - I never stopped running. Where have you been? At the hospital. I couldn't even have breakfast. You're lying to me. I'm not lying to you, Chlo?. I saw you when I got back. In 16th District, you were with a woman. What you're talking about? The hospital is in Porte de St-Ouen! I saw you. You were wrong. There was someone who looked like me. It was you! Chloe, oh! Calm down, come on. You're exhausted, you have not slept all night. Hush. Slowly. Hello. I'm calling you to make an appointment. My name is ?va. ?va Martin. And you can reach me at 0634221916. Thank you, goodbye. Hello? Miss Martin? Yes. I got your message. - Do you want to make an appointment? - Yes. Very well. That's possible in two weeks. - Couldn't it be any sooner? - Let me see. A patient has canceled tomorrow at 1 pm. Tomorrow, that's perfect. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Are you settled in alright? - Yes, thanks. - Is he happy? - Happy? - Yes, your cat. Ah! Milo! It's my friend who's got trouble. He never liked cats. Men understand nothing about animals. - Good evening. - Good night. Milo? Milo? Milo? Where are you? Milo? My cat! Who put you there? - Hello? - Yes, it's me. - Are you okay? - Yes, very well. - When are you coming home? - I have emergencies at the hospital. I'll be home late. Don't expect me for dinner, it may go on forever. - Very good. - Are you mad at me? No. Work hard. Thanks. Kiss you. LOUIS DELORD PSYCHOANALIST Behavioral and cognitive therapy Miss Martin. Come in. Have a seat. - Does it happen to you often? - What? Your little discomfort. No. Except in certain circumstances. You look like an acquaintance of mine. Really? Yes. Paul Meyer. He's my brother. Do you know him well? Not really. I started a therapy with him, but it did not work. I assure you, we studied together, but we are different in our method. - You do not come from him. - No. From a friend. - Well, my sister. - A friend? Your sister. - Do I know her too? - I don't think so. My name is ?va, I'm 25 years old... and I live with a man I adore. He loves me, but sometimes I feel really lonely with him. - Like a void. - Do you have sex with him? Yes, Of course. Everything comes from my mother: even dead, I feel she's watching me, judging me... But I'm not sure you can help me. If you follow my style of therapy, which isn't cheap, I can heal you. If you stop lying to me. - Lying to you? - Your sister, I don't believe it. You are an only daughter, right? Is your mother dead or are you wishing her death? Lie to seduce, it's usual in pretty women. Especially when they are frigid. Hello? Yes. I'll call you back. Kisses. Excuse me. Be aware that I don't keep all patients. Healing them would deprive them of their interest. Excuse me! It will not work between us. Thanks for settling the session; 150 euros. Don't say anything to my brother. - I don't see him anymore. - All the better. We'll see next time if you're interesting or just a little idiot. There will be no next time. How are things at the museum? - Here. - Not too bad. - Really? - Yes, it's okay. Are you bored? Why do you say that? I dunno. I just imagine myself staying hours like this... Why don't you introduce me to your family? My parents are in the U.S. As soon as they come back, I'll introduce them to you. And you didn't introduce me to your mother. My love... Oh... - What's wrong? - I dunno. Excuse me. - You should resume therapy. - You think? If you don't feel well, I can recommend someone to you. - I feel good. - The first time I saw you, you seemed so much stronger than many of my patients. You thought that I was a little idiot? No. Just a dirty idiot. Tell me the truth, what did you think of me? "Provided that I don't fall in love." Milo... My baby... - Would you like to have a brother? - A brother? I suffered from being an only girl. I never missed it. I had a very happy childhood. - And a twin brother? - No, thanks! To have a permanent mirror in front of you! Perhaps you have one without knowing it. Why did you change your name? Why didn't you keep Delord? I took my mother's name, it seemed simpler to me. My father had legal problems with his company, conflicts of interest, influence peddling, which made the headlines. He wasn't guilty, but responsible. There was no case, but his name has been soiled up. That's why they left. And when I settled in, I had to take my mother's name, on my father advice. That's it. Do you believe me? I do. This cat! Oh, fuck! - Hello. - Hello. Are you alright? - Yes. - I've prepared a cake, I wanted to share it with you. - Thank you. - Can I come in? Well... yes. You snugged very well. - I like the colors. - Thank you. Listen... Could you do me a favor? Of course! My friend is having trouble with Milo. Could I leave him to you? By all means! Sure you don't mind? I'll take very good care of him. I adore cats. A piece of cake from Rose. Agnes Wexler. You didn't think I would come back? I didn't even think about it. Do you regret it? I didn't like your behavior, last time. - But I think you could help me. - With what? - To heal. - To heal of what? - Of my problems. - Of your problems or your problem? My problem. How would you define it? - I dunno. - Yes. You do. No. That's why I'm here. For you to help me discover it. You're lying again. - That's not why you came back. - Yes, this is it. Perfect. See you next week, at the same time. - The session has just started. - It's me to decide on its duration. We said the essential for today. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Excuse me. 150 euros. So, this Agnes Wexler? - Very good. - Don't you want to tell me? She didn't talk much. She listened to me instead. A bit like you the first time. - Did you talk about your belly? - Yes. What does she think? - That it's your fault. - My fault? No, I am joking. We didn't really talk about it. Are you satisfied? Yes. She thinks she can heal me. Heal you? She used that word? - Yes. - Surprising. Why? It's not her style. What is it? Come in. - Follow me. - Where? - Undress. - You're crazy. - We move on to practical work. Come on. - No. Yes, you feel like it. I can't. He who desires without acting causes rot. I do not want you. So why did you come back? - For... - Yes? Knowing the truth. Let it go. Next time, you'll have to enjoy. You're leaving already? I have to go to work. Did you like our session? I never passed through such a thing. You never got fucked this way? You imagined it, that's the same thing. - He's beautiful. Is it yours? - Yes. Mine, I left him at my neighbor's because of my friend. - Is he allergic? - He just wants to be the only male. - It's a female? - No. Danton is male, which is rare for a tortoiseshell cat. - A what? - Don't you know? These are cats with two colors. In less than 1%, there are males who have a tricolor coat. They are twins. - Twins? - Yes. It's a genetic eccentricity. The result of trisomy of the sex chromosome. Unique, monstrous creatures. When the egg of the cat is fertilized, the fetuses develop in the uterus. And after a few weeks, they blend into one body. A unique cat that has genetic material of 2 twins: XXY. In fact, it's the dominant twin. It happens in humans too. Some people discover, once adults, that they carry the fetus of their brother or of their sister. They are cannibal twins. - Hello. - Hello. - Milo is fine? - I just wanted to see you. - What is it? - Sorry, I think I made a mistake. Do not worry: cats, they go, they come. He fled through there. I leave it open, so he can come back. Yes, my love, Luigi. It was my daughter's cat. - Your daughter's? - This was her room. Sorry, I did not know. - She's not dead, I reassure you. - Ah? All the better. She's just ill. She is in a rest home since she was 20. A tormented young girl. Come. How did you meet? - I prefer not to talk about it. - Why? I am an old patient. - Ah. Obviously. - Do you know Paul's brother? - Does Paul have a brother? - Yes, a twin. - Have you never met him? - No. - They studied together. - I would remember it! Excuse me. - Have you had cases of twins? - What do you mean? A patient who hides from you that he has a twin. No, but I imagine it must happen. When twins are raised in a situation of mimicry, as adults, they want to expel the double from their life. I remember parents who thought that their twins were psychologically connected. They had a secret language, and one of them sucked his brother's thumb. Odd, isn't it? Miss... - Thank you. - Thank you. Good evening. Good evening. Where have you been? I was hanging out. Who is that woman over there? - Are you kidding me? - Why? - Don't you recognize her? - No. It's your shrink, Agnes Wexler. I really drank too much, excuse me. Are we going home, please? - Good evening. - Good evening - Watch out. - It's okay! - What's the matter with you? - Nothing. Chlo?! - You feel better? - My stomach pain starts again. Is it Wexler? - But no. - Since you see her... - Stop the car. - What? Stop the car! I must get out! - I can't. - Stop! Chlo?! Watch out! Chlo?! What's she doing? That's not possible. Chlo?! Do you think I'm hysterical? Stop your bullshit, that's enough. Come on. Your friend would be jealous if he knew. I'd leave you. You love me less than him. With you, I only know sex. With him, you think you know him? No. Not really. Which one is the most attractive? I dunno. You don't know or you don't want to tell me. When I am with you, I think of him. When I am with him, I think of you. - What do you think of now? - You. - Liar! - It's true. Not this evening, my belly hurts. - Again? - It's my period. Let me go, Louis. - No, stop! - Let it go! No! No! - Let it go. - I don't want to. Is my brother fucking you like that? What? You're not the first to take a nickname, miss ?va-Chlo?! - Since when do you know? - Since the start. - Why didn't you say anything? - Your lies amused me. My brother can't take care of you like I can. - I'm off. - Wait. - No, I'm in a hurry. - Wait. - We need to talk! - We have to stop seeing each other. Just don't tell him anything. For him, you don't exist. I know. He never could stand having a twin. So, he denies me. He always wanted to be the only one. The only child. My parents' favorite. I don't exist anymore. - I'm going to stop. - You just started again. - It's like stirring shit. - That's the principle. - I'm fed up. - Looks like you're throwing a tantrum. - It's not a tantrum. - You need it. Did you tell her? - No. - Do it. - I'm sure she'll understand. - I don't like her. How so? I want to please her, so I hate her. I always think about her instead of thinking of you. That's real transference. It's a good sign. - Really? - Yes. You will persevere. You'll see, it'll get better. - Hello? - What the fuck are you doing? - I can't. - Why? I'm afraid Paul might suspect something. - Did you tell him? - Of course not. Then don't worry. I'll expect you tomorrow. You see that you like it. - Yes, but... - But what? I'd like to try something else. Oh? And what? I'd like to fuck you. You wouldn't like it? - Impossible. - Why? Isn't your therapy exploring my repressed desires? It's not with me you have to do it. But with whom? Guess. Paul changed his name to cut in with you? Of course. What do you feel for Paul? Nothing. I rarely think of him. Often, people confound us, but that's all. When they find out I'm his elder, they ask me about him. - His older brother? - Yes. 15 minutes older. - Why are you smiling? - 15 minutes is not much. I was born 15 minutes before him, head first, Paul came out after, feet first. My mother has suffered like a martyr. She lost a lot of blood because of him. I weighed more than 2.4 kg. He, not even 2 kg. Already in my mother's womb, I was the dominant. I'm right-handed, he's left-handed. Our hair curls in the opposite direction. His left eye is weaker, for me it's the right one. We are mirror twins. Did you knew that among some primitive peoples, they use to kill the second twin because he was weaker, and had less chances to survive? - Good evening. - Good evening. A reservation in the name of Meyer. Follow me. You were right. We did talk about it. I feel like I understand things about me, about you. - About me? - Yes. Why attracted me, why I love you. My pains are almost gone. That's good. You must continue, go further, - and you will feel... - Hush. You are no longer my shrink, sir. Just... my lover. - Chlo?... - Yes? Would you like to marry me? Become my wife? Can you help me? - Are we going to the room? - No, I prefer here. - Are you sure? - Yes. Go slowly. Softly. - Is it okay? - Yes. Slowly. You're hurting me. - Was it the first time? - Well yes. Did you like it? It was for you. Why don't you tell him? - Doesn't he want a child? - I guess he does. My poor Chlo?, you're lost. You don't know whose he is. I assure you, we have the same genes. Stop, Louis! Stop! What's your secret, Louis? I need to know, right now. What happened? What did you do to him to get you out of his life? Please, tell me. I am pregnant and Paul wants to marry me. Ask him. It's your secret against his. And if it's you who was obsessed with him? Jealous. In two seconds, you have become ugly. You hate Paul, because it's him, the real dominant twin. It's him who fucked you! Get out, Chlo?. Go away. You want me to leave? Very well. I'm taking my things. I'm going. Paul is waiting for me. Bitch! Go away! Slut! Stop! - Dirty whore! - Stop! Get out with your fetus before I kill you! Milo... It must be a little cold. I'll press a little. Something wrong? No, no. Wait, I'm looking. - Hello? - Hi, Chlo?. - I can't talk to you. - Is he there? - Beside me. - I missed you, Chlo?. - Have you missed me? - No, I won't see you anymore. Forgive me, for the last time. - I want to fuck you. - It's enough, stop. - You miss my cock. - You're crazy. - I want to see you again. - No. - I love fucking pregnant women. - That's enough. - Tomorrow, same time, same place. - Shut up! It's my child. Check the dates. Stop, I hang up. Who was it? A colleague at the museum. An organizational problem. Paul! - Am I disturbing you? - At last, you came to see me. A patient canceled, so I invite you to lunch. Accepted. It's charming, in here. My break is in 10 minutes, will you wait for me? Yes, I'll look around. - See you in a while. - Yes. - Have you forgotten your birthday? - You didn't tell me this morning. - I hope you'll like it. - It's a jewel. Bravo. - It reminds me of Milo. - Happy that you like it. Thank you. Did you take me for my brother? Calm down! Sorry, I had no other way to see you. I want to resume our therapy. I wanna heal you. - Sir? - Yes. - No. - Sweetheart? It's your birthday. - To our reunion. - Motherfucker! - You excite me. - I don't know what's holding me back. Our secret, Chlo?. - Let go of me. - Did Paul tell you about Sandra? - What? - Try this name, Sandra Schenker, and you'll understand. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you, Chlo?, Happy birthday to you! A little present for you. - What is it? - Guess. A cat-shaped brooch. - It would be of bad taste. - Yes. - Do you like it? - Yes, it's very beautiful. Thank you. - Do you see schoolmates? - Why? I met a girlfriend on the way home. I hadn't seen her for 10 years. It kind of shocked me. We were so close and now, we had nothing to say to each other. Her name is Sandra. No, don't answer. Surely one of your patients again. I like you to be jealous of them. Hello? Yes, it's me. Yes. Very well. 8:30 tomorrow. Perfect. See you tomorrow, thank you. Who was it? The taxi to the airport tomorrow. When are you coming back? The conference lasts 3 days. I'll be back on Friday. THE DELORD TWINS FASCINATE CROWDS Dear Paul, I can't live without you, for you are my balance, my reason to be, my heart, my body, my everything! Today I could finally tell you everything. Your dearest Sandra. - Hello? - Can I talk to Sandra Schenker? - Who are you? - An old classmate of Sandra's - and I would like to hear from her. - My daughter doesn't get out anymore. - Oh? - Since a long time. - And why, exactly? - Haven't you heard about her accident? - Good morning. - Good morning, Madam. Antigone, her most beautiful role. She was also wonderful as Ophelia. Even if the show wasn't very good. She was so young... Before each performance, she used to kneel and say a little prayer. - She was pretty, wasn't she? - Yes. She could have become a great actress. She always seemed so strong... So smart... Say hello, Sandra. She's an old classmate of yours, Chlo?. Go ahead, talk to her, don't be afraid. Hi, Sandra. You may not remember me, but... I am Chlo?. Sandra, don't be rude, my sweetheart. It's Chlo?! Look over there. She was delighted. We prepared ourselves very carefully: we washed our hair, had a haircut, and she chose her most beautiful dress for you. She has good moments and bad. We can't predict. Excuse me, I should not have bothered you. On the contrary, you do not bother us. On the contrary! Are you okay? Do you have time for tea? - If you want. - Very well, come on. They were such a perfect couple, Sandra and Paul, Paul and Sandra. He was shy, a charming boy. Not like his twin, a monster. It was him who got her drunk, pretending to be Paul. Sandra had never drunk alcohol. She was a serious girl, innocent, virgin. Then, what happened, happened. He raped her. When Paul found out, he reacted with great violence. He was so jealous! He began to hate his brother. He refused to see Sandra again. Sandra did not understand. And she committed this act: suicide attempt with a firearm. The twins, you know, we think that if we know one, we know both of them. But the Delord brothers... Did you know them? Yes. Did you ever have problems with them? No, well... Have you been their victim too? What do you mean? But you... You liked that. - Isn't it? - No. Little scumbag! You liked that. Filthy pervert! - Filthy pervert! - I have to go. I thought so! Little whore! My cat offers you its heart, and I mine. The one who really loves you. - Good evening. - Good evening! - Is there something wrong? - Paul isn't here, I feel in danger without him. Is your daughter's room free? Follow me. You'll be fine here. Safe. Come in. I was afraid you were still mad at me. Here, I'll give you a nightgown of my daughter. Thank you very much. Chlo?, wake up, there's someone for you. Look who I found downstairs. Milo, my love... - How did you know I was there? - Rose told me. I told her to watch over you. Let's go home. I should have told you about it. Yes, you should. If I had known about your brother, everything could have been avoided. Everything? You didn't tell me the truth, you forced me to search. To research your life, your things. - Why? - Because I love you. I didn't want to hear about that anymore. About my brother, about Sandra... I did everything to forget. She betrayed me. He desecrated her. I broke up with her, because I stopped loving her. I felt nothing anymore. I had no more pity for her. But it wasn't Sandra's fault. Your brother pretended to be you. He cheated on her and raped her. Certainly not! She was attracted to him. She was only interested in me because I was Louis's twin. It's him she really wanted. What do you think? That she was just a victim of two diabolical brothers? No. She has her share of responsibility. Her fascination, her excitement for the twins, - that's what killed her. - She's alive, Paul! Undead. Good morning, Chlo?. Slept well? I have prepared you my daughter's favorite cake. Excuse me. I have to go. - Hello? - Why did you lie to me? - Who's this? - It's me. - Paul? - Yes. You're back home? Wexler never heard about you. - But... - Why did you tell me you saw her? - You have a lover, right? - No. I need you to explain. Am I the father? Hello? Hello? What a pleasure to find my old patient! Don't touch me. My heart didn't make you happy? You didn't think it was his heart, did you? You know how much I love this animal. That's enough, Louis. I saw Sandra and her mother. I know what you have done. You only know to destroy. It's a ridiculous and tragic story. Sandra was a very pretty girl, but completely hysterical. It's this little slut who spoke about rape to my brother. You're lying. Did her mother tell you she was pregnant? By me, of course. It's funny. When I look at you, I see her again. - This same greedy mouth. - You are a monster. There is no monster, just human beings like you, me and Paul. My God, it's really the return of Sandra Schenker. I won't end up like her. She should have killed you. But are you sure, my dear Chlo?, that I am Louis? And not Paul? Don't move. - What are you doing? - We have a guest. - Paul? - He told me everything. - You shouldn't have lied to him. - The same mistake as Sandra. Stop! - Put this down. - And let yourself go. For us to fuck you. Because that's what you want, Chlo?. To be fucked by twins, like Sandra! Shut up! Who is Paul? - It's me. - It's me, Chlo?. No, it's me, Chlo?. It' obvious I am Paul, not Louis. Is this what you want? As with Sandra! - Don't shoot, it's me, Paul! - Don't shoot, you're carrying my child If you kill one of us, you'll lose the other. Think about your sister. You're double, too. - Hello, Paul. - Hello. I blame myself so much... It's none of your fault, Paul. My daughter has always been fragile. I didn't want to see anything. I thought that loving her would be enough to protect her, to help her live. Love never saved anyone. Mr. Meyer, you can come. How is she? This morning, she was better. She started eating again. She recovered from the operation. She can go home. Did you tell her about the baby? Yes. It was difficult to hear and to understand. But she understood. You can see that this outgrowth, that Chlo? took for a pregnancy, was a cyst that weighed less than a kilo. And that's what we removed from her belly. I'm warning you, it's a bit difficult to watch. It's impressive, but, in reality, it measures only 15 cm. - Her condition was related to that? - Discovering that, since always, she was carrying her twin's fetus, unconsciously provoked emotional shock and sexual blockage. It means that... I had two fetuses in me? Yes, at the start of your pregnancy. - I could have had twins? - Yes. If the second fetus had developed normally and hadn't been absorbed by that of Chlo?. Do you remember your ultrasounds when you were pregnant? No. I found out very late that I was pregnant. Chlo? was not a very... - perceptible child. - I see. - Hello. - Hello, doctor. Chlo?, your friend Paul and your mom came to pick you up. Hello, darling. - Are you well? - Yes. Hello, Chlo?. - I'll let you talk. - Thank you. The doctor told us you're better. - It doesn't hurt anymore? - No. I can't feel my belly anymore. All the better. And you, you're not sad? - For what? - For not having the baby. There's all the time in the world. You could quickly get pregnant. Did you see her, Sandra? - Sandra? - Yes, my twin sister. The fetus. No. Of course not. I saw on the Internet that I was a cannibal twin. The exact term is parasite, parasitic twin. I devoured the fetus of my twin sister. It was her in my belly. - No, Chlo?. - Chlo?, you didn't devour her, you absorbed her. It's not your fault. It didn't have the time to become a fetus. It was just a kind outgrowth of limbs and bones. It was my sister. Get home safely. I know you were always angry at me, 'cause I wasn't there when I should have been. But now, I'll be there. For you. You are my daughter, Chlo?. My only daughter. Are you okay? Would you have liked to have a brother? Cut it out, Chlo?, all this bullshit. It's over. Yes.
