I have to get home. - Mama is gonna kill me. - No. You are staying with me tonight? Roman wants us there at nine in the morning. Raya we've been over this. It’s just a few months working in a hotel. Yes, but.. You want to work at Copyshack like your mother? He said it was both of us or nothing! No. Fuck your mom! - I'm sorry - It's 1:30 in the morning. You don't understand Luba wanted me to... If her mother lets her do whatever she wants... go live there. You graduated You're an adult now. Do what you want. Raya? Big smile. Big smile. Good What will you say at border? I am Natalya... I am Natalya Verbova. I am going to Budapest to buy carpets for reselling. Raya... Hello. I'm working... Out! Out! Out! Okay, Mama, I'm Just going to lift this up. It's all right. Cross reference every injury with other cases... where courts ruled felony assault. If our courts rule that stabbing a man in a bar is criminal.. Then the same should apply to a woman in her home. I have considered the evidence... and rule in favour in Zlata Sehik. Raya, are you okay? -It’s me, Irka. Wake up! I'm calling from the Global Displacement Agency in Sarajevo. Do you have a daughter named Raysa? - Yes. Yes. - We have her here. If everything checks out... we will send her home in a few days. - I'll come there now. - I'm sorry we can't afford.. I’ll pay for it. Just tell me where to go. Roman will be home soon. Roman seems to be doing well. Milk? I need to borrow money. They found Raya in Sarajevo. I want to go and get her I don't need much. Does he still hit you? You know I hate to ask. But she is my daughter... and your niece. Please. I will get you the money But you have to go. Roman will be home soon. He won't give it to me if he knows it's for you. Where is the other girl? She's not here. Let's go. We'll do whatever we can to get Raya back. I am truly very sorry What will they do to her? What will they do to her? I want to show you what happens when you talk to the devil. Now. Bring her in. Bring her in. Bring her in. Bring her in. Watch. Make sure they are watching. Open your eyes. Watch! Watch! Take a good look. Look at your fucking friend now. You work in two hours. You sleep on whichever mattresses are free. They bring us food in the morning. You have to eat it all, or you get fined. Come sit down.! Don't let them see you like this. Okay? What is your name? Raya Kochan. I've nearly paid my debt Then I can go home. - It's all bullshit. - No. He sent a girl back three months ago. I was here. What is your name? She is Luba. Luba Pallch. I'm afraid we can't keep you here any longer I'll let you know if I hear anything. We’ll do anything we can to get Raya back. What is it? - We have to get out of here... - Don't. . You'll get us in trouble. GO. I wanted to tell you. It's how you pay for this. Roman, he does... How could you... sell your own blood? You swine. You swine. You swine. - Where is she? - I don't know. - Where is she? - I don't know. Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? She is no longer your sister: Stay away from me. Where is Raya? Where is the little bitch? She's in the back. I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything. Please...
