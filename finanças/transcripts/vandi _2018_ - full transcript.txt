Now it's my dad So my dad is not related to you. Is that it? Swathi! I am already in high pressure situation Don't mess around now I thought you considered him as your dad too Now I clearly see that you only use him for your gains Swathi! Is it Krishna? Ask him about the job He went for a bike, don't know if he got one I don't care about others matters. You ask for yourself She is crazy She wants me to consider her dad as my own dad She finds new ways to start a fight Ragavan! As your dad? Awesome It's simple dude! Ragavan has worked as security in many places So Swathi may have had a doubt. Isn't it? Stop talking like a fool and think what we should do next Or else we all will be in a big trouble What you expect us to do? We have checked all our contacts Jeeva will give his bike in three days. What is there to worry? To hell with three days Why are you pissed off on me? Ask him Arun Everyday hundreds of men park their bike in the morning and... take it only in the evening right? Some bikes will be left unchecked for weeks too Yeah, so? If we get a bike like that, we can manage these three days You want me to steal? Steal? It's wrong It's not a theft, it's just an adjustment for three days Adjustment? Don't talk about this again You want me to lose my job? It's not some lame food van business like yours It's controlled by the central government Vasu will put us in trouble if we do not return that mobile What trouble? The person who started it should end it Vasu will not cause me any harm Oh! So that's it Yeah You are right He has nothing to do with it He has done nothing wrong, why should he be in trouble We will take care of it ourselves Since we are friends, Vasu will think we are all in this together I will tell Vasu that you are not involved in this It's ringing Chief Vasu! It's Rafique You crook! Did you get back the phone? No... I called you to say about something If you give me any lame excuse, I will butcher you It's not that - My friend... - Which friend? - The cheat who lost the phone? - No not him It's about my friend Arun who works near the railway station What about him? Is he dead? No He is saying that if we do not get the phone... he is saying that you don't have the guts to thrash us - I never told so - I will teach you brats a hard lesson It was not us, it was him who said so. You speak with him You said I don't have the guts? I didn't mean that If I see you... I will slaughter you If I don't get the phone... - I never told so brother - You will die first I don't have guts? Do I look like a fool to you? Why are you acting so cheap? Are you not ashamed? Rafique! What's happening there? Nothing. Sit down Who is acting cheap? You used us for the food and booze... and distance yourself if we are in trouble.

Yes sir Yes, I identified the bike and helmet But it was not them They confessed that they stole the bike from the railway station - Yes - Then what? We did not steal it It was a small adjustment Adjustment? I explained you everything about it I don't believe you Sir! Let it be what... If they are really the thieves like you think... they should be punished I agree with you but... they did not beat and steal the jewels Please let them go Then? Are you saying I am wrong You are saying that I could not find the real thieves and putting the blame on them Sir! I did not mean like that If they are book under suspicion... their future will be spoiled They are just kids. Please show mercy What shall I do? You know the missing bike 'Duttu' A missing case has been registered on that bike in east police station Adding to that we have two more cases including your's Alright! You can take back your complaint since you know them But what about the other petitioners? We should answer them also right None of the petitioners saw the thief's face But under these circumstances, what if they identify them as thieves?

I can identify those guys How did they look? Name? I don't know about that but I can definitely identify them if I see Really? You remember the day when you came to get some money from me Look at the inspector while speaking Two days before Two guys parked that bike I asked them for parking money They gave me 100 rupees and ran away without getting the change Sir!

Be practical You think the legal system is fair? A single case will eat up half your lifetime Why are you saying them these things? They don't seem to understand the seriousness If we can get the address of the lady who bought the jewels, we can talk to her What about people who have filed the missing bike complaint First we shall meet the lady, then we can think further Being sad is not going to help anyone We shall talk about this tomorrow Now leave Have dinner and sleep You have made me jobless now Are you happy?

I am coming from the east police station This is the case file of that missing bike Why is he here? So you know him? The woman who took my mobile... he was the one with her at that time Is that him? He said he'll call me from outside What's with secret tone? Sir, this is another case Damn it! Another case! Who lodged the complaint? Sir, it was him Then who is he? Sir, the missing bike belongs to me Why did you lodge a complaint for his missing bike? Sir! These guys are jobless, I think! He borrowed the bike from him, sir You look educated. Why would you borrow bike from some doofus? Sir, I hired it for rent Yeah right! Hired bikes are quite useful to commit crimes. Isn't it? Go, get those fellows To hell with him and his neck band! You! Get those two criminals! Come on! His head injury... Robbing your jewellery... These guys have agreed to have committed the crimes But the problem is that... they sold the stuff and spent all the money They will give the full details about where they sold it. We have bashed them enough! There they are, fools! Go, stand there! To hell with their looks and inners! What's the use of stealing so much? Can't you guys buy a brand new inners and wear them? It stinks! Head constable... you don't know the youth fashion these days Today's youth wear only torn stuffs Do they look like they care? What do you say? How dare you laugh?! So, madam... Have a good look and tell us... Was it them? Since they were wearing helmet... I doubt if it was these two guys You fool! I told you to get them with the helmet on and you go them with the inners! If you keep saying stories like they were wearing helmet and you can't recognize... then the case will be dismissed in the court Sir! So, what I am suggesting is... tell us whatever you know and that too clearly Got it? Sir, a lady is here with the documents Ask her to come in Come in Why so late? Sir... this lady was there with him, when he lodged the complaint How come he is here? Witch! She is there everywhere I go! Dude... she is really hot. Isn't she? Doofus! She is the one who snatched away Salim bhai's mobile from me Is that her? I wanted to abuse her but drats, we are at the wrong place She is the one who snatched the phone - Head constable! - Sir? Check it and settle this. Carry on Ok sir - Head constable - Sir? While pressing charges on the charge sheet... take all the unsolved bikes cases and... - put it on them! - Ok sir These 'inner wear' boys must never set foot out of prison for life! - Got it? - Sir... No matter what we do... there will be many dinkus out there to bail out such doofuses! They will come, deal it smoothly and take these guys away Listen you guys! Like how you confessed here... you must confess in court the exact same way Got it? If you screw it up.... you guys won't have knees to kneel down It's chief Vasu. Ask them the phone First let this get settled After going out, I'll get the phone from here and the see what I do to her Hey! What's with the secret tone again? Sir, like I said, this is another case What's that case? Tell me! Keep saying that simply and I'll file you under a case and sent you to prison for life! Sir... well nothing... this lady took his mobile under a small misunderstanding circumstances The mobile is the root cause of all these issues If we can get back that mobile then... If we don't get the mobile, it'll become a serious issue Listen lady... if you have his mobile, why don't you just return it? Don't you have enough people to buy you mobile phones? Sorry sir, I lost that mobile What the hell? If I don't get that mobile... What happened? Calm down Sir, she has the mobile! He just called me few minutes ago saying he'll get the mobile Hello! I called you? I didn't call you Sir, I didn't call anyone No sir. What I said is true I have lost the phone Accent? Huh! Where did you miss the phone? Sorry... Who is Krishna here? It's me Isn't this the phone you were looking for? - That's the one - How did you get it? Don't you feel ashamed to invade others privacy and shoot them? Sir, I didn't do any such thing What's going on? Don't you settle disputes when I am here! Who took away your phone? It was that lady What's with that tone? It was that madam Why did she snatch it from you? She misunderstood that I recorded them when they were intimate at the hotel Ah...Ok! Ok! I get it So, you recorded them when they were romancing in the hotel No sir And so she snatched it away from you Then he delivers the phone that she snatched it away from you How did he get the phone? Same doubt Thank you... for saving my life Thank you, sir Excuse me What's going on? How dare you slap her in front of me and that too in my police station? Who are you? She is my wife - Wife? - Sorry! Was my wife! Woman like this are different cases Not within our limits All she deserves is one tight slap! Get lost! What are you looking at? Get lost! Mahesh! Mahesh! All the cases linked to Duttu comes to an end here At the same time, all of them continue their life's journey Rita's life could end in divorce Or else... Mahesh can forget everything and take her back Well, he has a Geetha if not Rita If not Duttu then some other bike But no matter what... he always has a girl riding with him After this, these guys are presented in court and sentenced They will learn their lesson and change for good If that's what you thought... then that's a blunder! Though they stole for a good reason... There is noting good about stealing. Stealing is stealing! After this, he got an exact same phone that created all this mess... he is paying for it in installments and he works at a proper job, like a responsible man After this case, Arun become more strict in his job and committed no blunders Rafique? Still continues to work in the same food van to spend on girlfriends Somasundaram is quite happy Because he has never closed any case properly during his service See you, sir. I got it - Listen... - Sir? At least hereafter when you rent out the bike... - be careful. Got it? - Ok sir Or else you'll reduce weight running back and forth to the police station Duttu's journey from here... is with this handsome hunk! Because he is the real owner of this bike I don't think I'll have to bear this fatso for long I am very sure that soon someone will turn up to steal me again I don't care who it is But he must have a girlfriend like this one! That's all I wish for!
