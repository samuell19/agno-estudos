(gentle ethereal music) Clint? (water splashing) Clint! How did you get up there? First rule of magic. You know that. That's not funny, you scared me. (yelling) (splashing) It's time. I think it's fine. Can I just finish my hot dog? I just don't see what the big rush is. CLINT: We keep moving.

You know the book you're reading there is out of date. It used to be that to determine the eye color was a single gene trait, but now they're saying that it's actually eight different genes that determine the amount of melanin in an iris. If I have blue eyes, and you have brown eyes, then Cheryl must have had blue eyes too. Sure. You don't know? What's your guess? My guess is blue. There you go. That's in your book, right? She's probably still somewhere in the South, right? South, California, the moon. Doesn't matter. It was just a question. Yeah, well the point is that she zigged and we zagged. (people chattering) 800 books I believe. I mean, who has that in their library? Oh miss, I'll check that out for you. Do you have a library card, dear? (steady music) You don't have to pay 400 dollars for a new sink. No, they're just trying to rip you off. Alright, there you go. There it is. It just fits on like so. There's these little nubs on the nut. Okay. It fits perfectly on it, and you turn it clockwise and done. So it must come in pretty handy knowing how to fix everything, huh? CLINT: Yeah, we wouldn't get very far without knowing how to fix things. Humans have been a migratory species since we've been on Earth. Nola and I are just going back to our roots. She's been on the road since before she could even walk. WOMAN: Really? CLINT: Mm-hmm. WOMAN: You weren't worried about her adjusting? CLINT: Adjusting to what? Life without brain-numbing television? Then no. You know, we're pursuing I would call it the low budget high experience model of living. No amount of money can buy an education like that. I mean, we've been... (door slamming) You know, you could've fixed that with your eyes closed and one hand tied behind your back. She was ready to go out and buy herself a whole new sink. You're just always looking for new converts. You know, society will be much better off once we build an army of self-sufficient agitators. If we consume less, we produce less. But you'd earn less. Yes, but you notice that I did not teach her how to fix the sink. You see? Now, granted, the world is not ready to bend to our ways, I will give you that. Not everyone wants to live like us. Of course they do. (upbeat music) Fear is the only thing holding these people back. They've got their driveways, they've got their backyards, got their pools. We have our freedom.

I can't watch 'til the end of a movie without you making me hop around. Do you know how exhausting that is? (steady music) Thanks. Let's go. Thank you. (ethereal vocalizing) (steady music) Night Nola. (spitting) (birds chirping) Am I to expect another full day of the silent treatment? Can't give your old man a break? Guess where we're going next. Doesn't matter. Okay, well then how about I give you a hint? Your namesake. I've said too much. We're not really going. You said I could only go once I'm 21. Well I'm sure we'll still find a way to get ourselves into trouble. Are you serious? We're going to New Orleans. No better time than now, right? You promise. Cross my heart. Where'd you get that? Found it at the pool. Suits you. Good morning, gentlemen. GUY: Hey. MAN: How's it going? GUY: Is this your ride? CLINT: This is the ride, yes. This is The Hulk. Oh, sweet man. Thank you. The Hulk? Need a better paint job for that name. Y'all come down for the van festival? What's that? It's a big annual gathering. One of those gatherings where everyone heads back after to their cozy little homes and describe how they had a crazy weekend in the wild. No. Nola and I, we get ourselves million dollar views wherever we go without paying property taxes. So, you travel full time? Yes sir. What did you do before? Well, I actually had a bar. What was it called? CLINT: Nola. It was called The Mercury Bar. This was in Albuquerque? Weren't we there like last Summer? No it was two Summers ago, man. North Carolina. Hey, good morning. Good morning. Head's pounding this morning. How'd you sleep? Good. ♪ My love has gone ♪ ♪ My love ♪ Where to? New Orleans. Yeah, yeah, we will. Just, getting my head on. I thought you said we were really going this time. Yes. New Orleans is sinking, and I don't want to swim. What? (ominous rumbling) Watch the rocket. Clint. Clint, stop. (tires screeching) Dad... Clint? Dad. (ominous rumbling) (inaudible) (inaudible) (inaudible) (clock ticking) I need you to complete this. Take your time. (phone dialing) Hello, yes, we have a minor here. Her father, no other living family. Yes, we have her waiting here. Where's the bathroom? SECRETARY: Just down the hallway on the right-hand side. (gentle music) (metal clanging) (gentle melancholy music) (weeping) (banging metal) Please. (banging metal) (crickets chirping) (engine puttering) (people chattering) Shame on them for letting them all go to waste. (indistinct whispering) Well today's your lucky day. All of those hot dogs are yours. They were gonna go in the trash. Thank you so much. That's... No problem. NOLA: Thanks. MARCIE: Where are you driving to in the middle of the night? I'm just on a cross country road trip. Where'd you start out from? Arizona. Arizona, I've never been there. Thank you so much. My pleasure. That's a big van you're driving all by yourself. I hope you don't mind my saying that. You know, I could never drive such a big vehicle. Yeah, my dad taught me. And you're driving straight through, all the way from Arizona. I'm on my way to college. And how old are you? Listen, you need to work on your act. Just say you're emancipated. Look, I know you need to go. There's a Sunday potluck at the church in town. And you're very welcome to come. I hope to see you there. (door slamming) (tapping on window) (tapping on window) You can't park here. Look. My boyfriend kicked me out of our spot. Can you just let it go for one night? The van is fine parked here. You can't stay. So you're saying a car is more important than a person. Ma'am, it's a parking lot. Here's what I can do in this situation. I can either call the cops and you can spend the night at the station, or you can leave. Now. (engine revving) (gentle melancholy music) (door slamming) (man chattering on TV) (people chattering) It's cheaper. No no no. We gotta stay warm. Do you guys need help with anything? No, no, we're set. Come on, we've got to make a decision. Okay, let's make a decision. Actually, that one's not really reliable. Those can be really tricky to install. We're just browsing. MALE SHOPPER: Really, we're fine. (crickets chirping) (people chattering) Hey! (machine whirring) (muffled hip hop music) (people chattering) (laughing) (rap music) Yo, there's someone in the house. (thudding) (boys yelling) (laughing) It's fine, it's fine. Relax. It's all good, it's alright. We're all friends. This is my house! Hey, chill out! You're trespassing! It's cool. Is this your spot? (laughing) Is this your house? It is now. (laughing) (upbeat rap music) (all chattering) (coughing) (laughing) Oh come on, you alright? She's playing. Uh oh! (laughing) No fun, come on. (muffled rap music) (muffled chattering) (birds chirping) (door slamming) (engine humming) (gentle music) (spitting) (coughing) Hey! I prefer you didn't do that. So where does that leave us now, huh? Alright. You want to drop out, you want to live off the grid, be a radical. But I'm telling you, you can't do it off the backs of innocent people who make an honest living. WIFE: Carl, where are you? Yeah I'm coming. Just heard the raccoons. Hear me? Yes sir. Good luck to you. (spitting) (people chattering) Okay, make sure you get some of that Frito pie then. Mark, always so lovely to see you. Macaroni and cheese. Alright, good morning, Keith. Alright. There you go. How's Louise, is she good? I know that she wasn't feeling right. It's alright, honey. Go and get some Frito pie. Alright, here's a plate for you. Well look who decided to show up. What's your name? Nola. Nola. Oh, god, what a beautiful name. (people chattering) Mind if I join you? Oh boy, that was quite a turnout today. Did you meet anyone? A couple people. That's great. So, what's your next stop on your road trip, Miss Nola? Kinda just let the road tell me where to go. Well you can stay here with us, if you'd like. We've got a full house, but there's always room for one more. Yeah. Come on in. We have the house all to ourselves tonight. Brett took the kids to grammy and grampy's. SHIRLEY TEMPLE: Follow me. Oh I'm frightened of this. I'm frightened too. This time, Mickey. Come on, give me your hand, look out. Here, let me do yours. Here you go. Yeah. (muffled chattering on TV) (clock ticking) (dramatic orchestral music) BRETT: Everybody in, let's go. MARCIE: Hi. CHILDREN: Hi mom! Hi mom. Hi mom. MARCIE: How was grammy and grampy's? Hi sweetie. BRETT: Backpacks, let's go. MARCIE: Put your backpacks on. Okay everybody, this is Nola. She's gonna be joining us for dinner tonight. CHILDREN: Hi Nola. MARCIE: You got what you need, honey, huh? How was volleyball, was it good? CHILD: Yes. Oh good. Bentley, are you alright, hon? Thank you Lord for this bounty for which you have provided us tonight. And for bringing a new friend into our home. Through Christ our Lord, amen. ALL: Amen. Pass the bread? (slurping) So Nola, Marcie was telling us that you're on a road trip. That must be exciting. Yeah. Are you going all the way to California? NOLA: Maybe. CHILD: Ooh, I want to come. GIRL: Me too, can I go with you? Nola, elbows off the table, please. Thank you. (gentle music) I could do that. (ethereal vocalizing) (chickens bocking) (sighing) So right now we're in gear. Gonna go to neutral. Got it. And then we have to turn the key, get it started. So you start to turn it. (engine revving) What the hell do you think you're doing? Get out of the car, Bentley, now. I was just teaching him how to drive. Are you out of your mind? Mom, I'm fine. What you did was reckless, and it was dangerous. I learned how to drive when I was his age. Don't you ever do that again. (gentle ethereal music) (tapping on window) (crickets chirping) That one looks like an octopus. See? Tentacles, and a head. If you squint a lot, maybe. Yeah. You know that a 100-pound Pacific octopus can squeeze through a hole the size of a cherry tomato. No way. Yeah, it's true. I was actually just finishing reading about an octopus in Brighton Aquarium, and when no one was watching, it goes, makes its way to another tank, eats a lumpfish, which is an interesting choice 'cause they're not the most delicious looking thing. People showed up in the morning. It was back in its tank. Escape artist. Yeah. Yeah, there's no keeping an octopus in its tank, apparently. (gentle ethereal music) (gentle music) (engine humming) (engine puttering) God damn it! (engine puttering) (thudding) (door shutting) (gentle music) (car whirring by) (bell ringing) (light music) What's up, little lady? My van broke down. It's a 1984 VW Westfalia. Just on the road outside of town. How in the hell did you get a van like that? It's mine. Where'd you leave it? (whistling) This is some antique you got here. I used to help my uncles work on their Baja bugs down in Mexico when I was just a kid. (laughing) So I mean, you know then, it generally runs just fine. It definitely breaks down from time to time, but this time it just lost all power and it wouldn't restart. Yeah, parts are gonna be hell. (door slamming) Your fuel lines are 30 years old, as far as I can tell. It's fine, though, right? It just needs repairs, not a whole new system. The fuel lines are cracked and leaking. I can't let you get out of here like that. Well how much is that gonna cost? Let me get you an estimate. That fuel system is 500, head gasket, 1000, 60 for local tow, hookup fee 75, and your mileage 15 dollars, 1,650. I helped. What's that? I said I helped. Do you think maybe we could split the difference? I get it. That's why you kept trying to grab the tow ropes, huh. It doesn't work that way, baby. Thanks. (muffled rock music) (people chattering) (light country music) (people chattering) Excuse me. Do you know this place? Get out of here. I don't care what the shop manual says. When it gets hot, I run 60 riding my bike. Not the 20-50. I mean, that's what they're recommending anyway. Do you know this place? Holy smoke, look at here. Mercury Bar. This is goddamn Mercury Bar. Let me see this. Can you see it? Well we burned some brain cells in that place. (laughing) That guy ran it, remember young guy, he's a big charmer, you know. Was his name, was it Clint? Heck, I don't know man, he's so damn tall. I just called him Shorty. Shorty, yeah, that works. Listen, do you remember anything else about this place? Go check it out yourself. It's about three blocks up. Thanks. Hey why don't you buy us a drink before you go? (people chattering) (muffled rock music) (dog barking) (distant car honking) (upbeat Latino music) Possibly some... Hold on, wait a minute. What the hell are you doing? Working for you. You need the help, and I need the repairs. (birds chirping) Young lady, are you deaf? Didn't I tell you to get out of here? Am I gonna have to like, physically throw you? Miguel! Hey Lar, I'll be right there. Your car's out back, alright? Look, start cleaning those tools over there. The brake cleaner and the rags are underneath. Get 'em done. Okay, we're open. Monday through Friday from 7:00 to 4:00. Thank you so much. And you're only staying 'til your parts and the tow are paid up. Of course. And your van is taking up space. So you're gonna have to pay the storage. And every day, you make sure this is locked. Got it. (metal rumbling) (upbeat Latino music) Hey, Cachorro. Come here, take a look at this. NOLA: What did you call me? Cachorro, you know, a little runt puppy. I mean, look at this hunk of junk. I bet it still runs fine. You know, you don't see too many of these around these parts. Who's that? MIGUEL: That's Blue. NOLA: That's her real name? I guess, that's what she goes by. I don't pay her no mind. Just another little Cachorro like you. So what, she just hangs out all day? Eh, she's not causing any trouble. I don't care what she does. As long as her daddy don't come around. That's a piece of work. She's alright in my book. Excuse me, how do I get a library card? Do I need to fill out an application? Oh, we don't make things that complicated. I can sign you up right now. Okay. Why are you always hanging out at the garage? Beats being home. That's the petrified forest. In Arizona, the colors of the rocks are just, you think there'd be dinosaurs walking around. Is that where you're going when you fix your van? I don't know. LIBRARIAN: The library will be closing in 10 minutes. Blue? (knocking on door) Blue? (knocking on door) Are you okay? Blue. (knocking on door) (laughing) I'm sorry. Is it your first time? BLUE: No, I just don't have anything with me. Here, just take my jacket. Tie it around your waist for now. I have stuff in my van if we walk back. Okay, thank you. (bright instrumental music) (singing in foreign language) I thought all home-schoolers were hippies or Jesus freaks. Yeah, well that's not why I was homeschooled. It's because the state of education in the US is in shambles. It's been in this deep crisis since the 1950s. I had the best education in the world, and it didn't cost a dime. Yeah, well my school is free too. Public school. Oh, even if I wanted to do, it'd be impossible, 'cause I never went. And your mom was okay with that? I don't have one. Everyone has a mom. At least in the beginning. Mine died when I was 10. I'm sorry. It's okay. She never stood up to my dad when she was alive, anyways. What happened to yours? NOLA: I don't know. What do you mean? I mean I don't know where she went. BLUE: And you never wondered? No, I did. I still do. And I tried to look for her, but I never found her. You know what, scorch and scatter me when I'm gone. Yeah, put me in a pepper grinder, and sprinkle me over all the people that pissed me off. Here's a little Miguel, here's a little Miguel for you. There's a lot of Miguel for you. Yeah, okay. Let me know when the funeral arrangements are. Alright, bye. Are you okay? Yeah. My cousin Ronnie. NOLA: I'm sorry. We always talked about being here in America. We planned on opening up this shop together. What happened? I made it across, he didn't. You know, for the next project, you can clean out the store room upstairs. Sure, okay. And, if you like it, you can go ahead and move in there. No, I'll be okay. (gentle music) The good thing about the storage room, is there's heat up there. Alright let's go, tighten it up. I'm not a runaway, if that's what you think. Well, that's none of my business. (drill whirring) That's it, pretty good. You'll let me know when you get back on the road, right? Not anytime soon. I paid off the parts, but I still have the labor to go. Have you ever been to Navajo Nation? No. Well my aunt lives there. She's on the res. You know, I can't take you with me, though. I can't live with my dad anymore. At least you have a dad. (gentle melancholy music) (knocking on door) Was that your dad? This is nothing. Come on. I just know that she left when I was born. What happened? It was always this big secret. Clint, my dad, he never really went into it. He said it was better that I didn't know. I don't think so. All I knew was her first name. Cheryl. And I guess Frankel, which is my last name, but who knows if she ever took his name? Maybe she remarried. Or she could be dead. So, all I have is this. You don't have an address or anything? No, nothing. Do you have a credit card? MIGUEL: Fan belt, plugs. (light Latino music) BLUE: Try your dad. That's him. How'd you get it? Don't worry about it. I guess she's still here. (cars whirring by) Hey. MIGUEL: Hey! What's up? (laughing) What's going on? You know it's been a month. I didn't think it was possible, but I tallied up all your hours. Really? Yeah. Today, you're all checked out! What is this stripe? I didn't think it was gonna survive the operation, but the mighty Hulk will live to ride again. Why did you paint it? Oh, you don't got to worry about it. We're all squared up. What made you think you had the right? Hey now. This is my van. I've repaid all my debts. I put a roof over your head. I've been taking care of you. I even fixed your old jalopy. I could have fixed it myself, you didn't have to touch it. (gentle melancholy music) Welcome, have a seat anywhere you'd like. Sure I can't get you any pie? (people chattering) Sorry, we're a little short-staffed. Can I get you anything? MAN: I'll just take a glass of water, thanks. What? I'll take some coffee? Coffee, got it. There you go. (light country music) WAITRESS: Well, we made it through the day, Cheryl. CHERYL: Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. Hey! Where is he? (weeping) So when did you open your diner? It'll be 12 years next month. Do you like it? It has its ups and downs. It's a tough business. Like when you and Clint had Mercury Bar. (chuckling) That was a whole other ball game. What do you mean? We didn't see eye to eye when it came to business. So that's when you sold everything and just decided to live on the road? No, the bar went under, when we had you. We got the van to drive out to New Orleans to open up a new place. I installed this whole stove. You did? You came out with a Mohawk. Just a shock of white blonde hair. Clint was sure that you'd have his hair, but you didn't. I thought you'd have blue eyes. Yeah, mine are more green. You got your blue eyes from my mom. You're his kid, though, through and through. Do you think if Clint didn't want to live in the Hulk, then we would've been a family in a home? I don't know how to answer that. Would you like to stay with me now? For the time being. (birds chirping) Where are you going? To the diner. I can go with you. No no no. I gotta get going, I'm sorry. (steady melancholy music) Don't worry about money. The best things in life are free. Yeah right. May as well have said, "I can't help you, I'm just a cookie." (laughing) Let me open yours. You will always have good luck in your personal affairs. I'll take it. What did you do today? Just kinda hung out. I should've left you my keys, I'm sorry. I didn't think about it 'til I was driving home. No it's fine. I actually was starting to look into schools. Schools? Like, college. About time I got out of that cookie. It does not say that, let me see. You will live a long prosperous life. NOLA: That's a good one. Yeah. Here you go. (people chattering) (gentle country music) Hey. Hey. What are you doing here? I just thought I would come say hi. Hello again. CHERYL: This is Nola. I remember you from the other night. How do you two know each other? My niece. She's visiting from out of town. Oh. I'll see you back at home? What time? I just, I don't know. The fridge broke down again. I'm waiting for the guy to come fix it. Great. TV REPORTER: The crime rate in this country has been declining for the first time in 15 years. (door rattling) Today was a hell of a day. I made us dinner. (ticking calculator) (sighing) I can't catch a break in this damn place. What happened? Just about a million things. Comes with the territory. We had a fire a while back that we're still trying to bounce back from, then I found out one of the waitresses was skimming off the top. Now the fridge. I mean, I could come and help, if you want. Oh no, no sweetie. It's nothing crazy, but all at once, it feels like a lot. You know, I was thinking about something that I wanted to talk to you about. Okay. I think it's time for me to sell The Hulk. Why would you do that? Because I need the money, and if I was seriously thinking about looking at schools and things like that... Well I doubt you could get very much for it, honestly. I'm sure it's worth something. I can try to sell it for you this weekend. I know the guy who owns the used car lot. I'm sure he'll give you a fair price for it. (gentle music) Well. You want to guess how much I was able to get? Tell me. CHERYL: Honestly, it's such a piece of junk. I thought he was gonna laugh me off the lot. You know, they're really built to last. I mean, if the right person knows how to take care of it, they'll run forever. I'm pretty sure he just bought it for parts, but regardless, here's your big pay day. $7,000 dollars. I know, right? Let's go out tonight. To new beginnings. Alright. (laughing) (people chattering) (light music) This place is really really nice. You look pretty. Thank you, that's sweet of you. You look pretty cute yourself. It'd look good on you. That's good. You put your lips together. Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. (laughing) WAITER: Ladies, what can I get for you to start? I'll have a Diet Coke. WAITER: Certainly. Light on the ice, please. WAITER: Light on the ice, and for you? I'll have one too, no ice. WAITER: No ice. Be back in a second. How's your steak? It's really good. Can I have a bite? Yeah. Mm, mm, I love a night off. It was such a good idea. So did you ever meet anyone after Clint? You know, there were a few guys who came and went. I work all the time. It's hard to make anything stick. So many jerks. And the good ones always wanted kids. And you never wanted kids? It's a whole thing. Let's not get into that tonight. They got the fries right here. If I had a baby, I would've never left. You know Clint's the one who wanted to be a parent. Not me. You're alive because I left. We were broke, you know. We were drunk. Neither of us was in any state to be raising a child. Clint never drank. I can't imagine Clint drinking ever. We were real messed up. And I was depressed. He came to me, and he said he'd rather raise you all by himself. And at the time, that seemed like a good idea. So I let you go, and... Ladies, how are we doing? Just the check, please. Okay. (gentle music) (ethereal vocalizing) Looking to buy a car today? Looking for a van, actually. Alrighty, I'm Randy. Let's go over here. This is a classic. Complete with a bed, a full kitchen, and a pop-up roof to boot. How much? You're in luck. My manager is in a very generous mood today and he told me, "Get this thing off the lot for $10,000 dollars." Don't vans like this break down all the time? We need something that's reliable. I'll tell you what. Just for you, $9,000 dollars. Look, it has to come with a warranty too, right? That's worth something, I'm sure. Must shave off a couple hundred at least. Well if you're willing to take that risk. Let me talk to my manager and see what we can do. Great. I'll be here. Hey, what can I do for you today? Do you have any idea how hard it is to replace a main seal on one of these old vans? This one definitely has a rear main seal leak. It's the hardest thing to replace. We didn't check for this? You knew these things leak oil like crazy. (gentle music) RADIO ANNOUNCER: Well the fire we reported at the old fire hole is still burning out of control...

(laughing) (cars whirring by) How far is your aunt's? It's a eight our bus ride. But you know the way? Of course. It's a lot bigger in here that for what it looks like on the outside. I think it's cool that you grew up this way. Clint would always call the window of The Hulk my TV when I was little. I mean, I wanted the ones that you would see at the laundromat, but he would always say, "Just turn on the TV if you get bored." So I sit there and watch everything go by. There's only one channel. Did you end up finding your mom? Yeah. She wasn't what I expected. Sorry. Don't be sorry. I wanted to know. Now I know. I think that you can have your biological family, but also sometimes you can have your logical family too. (gentle music) (ethereal vocalizing) Thanks for the ride. It's been nice being back on the road with somebody. Keep in touch. Definitely. Here. Write to me first, and then give me an address so we know where to write back.
