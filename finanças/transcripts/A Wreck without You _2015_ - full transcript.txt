(WIND WHISTLING) (DOG BARKING) (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (ALISON GIGGLING) (ALISON CHUCKLING) Hi. Hi. (WATER BUBBLING) CHARLIE: Be careful it's hot. Ever done anything so bad you were worried you might go to hell for it? Uh, no, have you? ALISON: I don't think so. Wouldn't you know if you had? Well, I don't believe in hell. Do you think when you go you know why? Like what you did and all to get sent there? Is this really a breakfast conversation? It's whatever conversation. I don't really think there's such a thing as hell not like a actual place that you could get sent. Maybe like a state of mind or something. ALISON: Just hypothetically, though, hell is a place, what do you think? Is this what you get from eating oatmeal? You wanna talk about hell? Sorry, forget it. Okay, say it again. Okay, so when you're in hell, like a literal hell, a place that you're sent for being bad, do you automatically know why you're there? Does Bin Laden know why he is where he is? Yeah, definitely, of course. ALISON: Why? Well, otherwise what would the point be? You gotta know what you did wrong if you're gonna be punished for it. But that would make the punishment worse, don't you think, if you didn't know? If you thought you were totally innocent and suffering for no reason. That's pretty mean and pointless. You think God is mean and pointless? The devil maybe. There is no devil. Your brain is fucking spooky. Says the guy who talked my ear off last night about what it's gonna be like when he's dead. Everybody is gonna die, that's just gonna happen. That's reality. Hell is not reality. There is no hell so why bother thinking about it? And this oatmeal is hell. CHARLIE: Oh. ALISON: What flavor is it? Oatmeal flavor. ALISON: Hmm. You know, I guess I agree it would make it worse to be punished for a crime you've forgotten especially if God wasn't trying to redeem anybody, just make 'em eat shit. So what's it look like? Hell? Yeah, what are you thinking, what are you picturing? Like fire, red dude with a pitchfork, - lava flows and shit? - No, no, no, no. Way scarier than that. Scarier? ALISON: Hmm? How? It's just like this, you know. And everything normal and nice. And everything's just kinda regular. And then you'd forget where you were and you'd forget what put you there, but then... Then what? And then something would happen. Something terrible. And it would remind you and you would remember. Let me tell you something. If this is hell, I don't give a fuck about heaven. (HARD ROCK MUSIC) I'll tell you she's nothing like the last girl he brought around. (GENTLE MUSIC) Not at all. Remember the one you brought around before that? Well, exactly, that'd be the whole point wouldn't it? And how did you meet this one? - You're gonna make fun of us. - She's your cousin? CHARLIE: No. She's your sister. JERRY: Charlie are you dating your sister? BILL: Mom introduced the two of them. Well, actually she's my cyborg and I assembled her in the lab. She is very lifelike. CHARLIE: Yeah, I spent a lotta money. JERRY: Is she electric or a diesel? Jerry, it's been forever since you said 10 minutes. Your guests are starving. Just a few more moments, darling. Why don't you go in and set the table? Darling, the table is set, just hurry it up. Are you guys okay on beers? Okay. Cunt. Dick. He's such a dick and he thinks he's so not a dick but by not being a dick he's a dick, you know? You. (DINA SIGHS) Who's a dick, Jerry? No, my dick, Bill. What did he do this time? He's always done something. Nope, that's the problem. He doesn't do anything wrong anymore. I don't remember the last time we argued about him drinking too much or staying out except I know it's been over a year. I mean, I don't think we've had so much as a heated disagreement since we graduated college. He just does everything right, like a nice decent guy. I feel like his commitment has disappeared. My parents have stayed married for 20-something years and I don't remember them ever not fighting. When you love someone, there is always something to fight about, isn't there? Well, there should be, right? Do we sound crazy, Alison? No, not at all. I think I get what you're saying like passion is really important. You are not like any of the other girls (DINA LAUGHING) that Charlie has brought around before. Actually, you're really interesting. Didn't you just ride (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) your bike down from San Francisco? Wait, you did what? What for? Yeah, it was pretty cool actually. For cancer? What? Like for charity, you rode your bike all that way? No. I was spending some time in San Francisco and I wanted to see my cousin in LA and I was pretty broke. All I had was my bike that I bought to get around so. (LAUGHS) That's crazy. How long did that take, a year? A little under a week. Where did you sleep? I had a tent in my backpack. A tent on the ground out in the open? Well, campsites and sometimes in the woods off the highway. My goodness. Weren't you afraid you'd be raped? That definitely crossed my mind. I spent the whole first night paranoid clutching my pepper spray. But yeah, then after that it was fine. Nobody ever bothered me. That's amazing. (DINA GRUNTS) It was fun and adventure. What do your parents think of your adventure? They don't really care what I do. (SCOFFS) That must be nice. Not really. How did you and Charlie meet again? Well, you know, it comes with the territory. It's hell out there and it's every man for himself. - CARA: That's crazy to me. - JERRY: It's the way it is. You'd think in a town like this filled with artists and outsiders that they'd come out here and do things differently, more civilized. DINA: I don't know, people are people no matter where you put it. I like people out here. Californians are like Southerners, slow, easygoing. Those are Californians, not Los Angelenos. It's an entirely different breed. And I'm not talking about the Mexicans what have you. I'm talking about the people coming here for business, the industry folks and what not. I like the weather. Yes, absolutely. I haven't bought a coat in three years. You need a coat by the way. No, see, honey, that's the thing I don't. Do you miss New York, Charlie? No, I don't. How 'bout you, Alison. Have you spent much time on the East Coast? I went to school in Boston. Oh. You need at least one coat. If it gets cold out, I just throw on a sweater. No, you need a coat. Alison, is Boston where you're originally from? No, I grew up in Florida. Oh, I love Miami weather the most. Don't need a coat out there. Uh, yeah, it's pretty hot and sticky around. But I was born in northern Florida, like north of Jacksonville. So practically Georgia. Not a lot of culture down there is there? (JERRY CHUCKLES) In northern Florida? There's culture. Probably not the kind you would usually equate with the word. Well, no Jews, no Chinese food. (JERRY CHUCKLING) Right, that. There's some of both of those things actually. Yeah. Hey you two never told us how you met. (CHUCKLES) It's a silly story. So what, what does it matter? Just tell us. Yeah, now I wanna know. It's not embarrassing is it? Yeah, what's the big mystery? Oh, thank you guys for coming, uh. It was so nice meeting you, Alison. So nice meeting you, too. Thanks so much for inviting me. CHARLIE: Yeah, thanks, Dina. He likes you. I can tell, it's the real deal. Stop it, please. (LAUGHING) See he's blushing. He says stop but he wants me to say it out loud 'cause he knows it's true. (CHARLIE CHUCKLING) Fine. I'll stop. Drive safe. She thinks she's funny. (BOTH GIGGLING) Did you have a good time? I did. Did you? Yeah. Your friends, it was nice. (GENTLE MUSIC) So what else have you done besides weed? Oosh. You go first. Coke. Yeah. A few times. Huh, oh. ALISON: You? A few times. Can be fun, depends on the crowd of people. It's okay. Makes me wanna talk a lot but totally incapable of listening. I always end up feeling like I'm talking to myself. Pills, opiates? No heroin or anything but I've done pain killers for fun. Me, too. I had a few Oxys once. Took one at a party, didn't feel anything. So next morning I popped the other one and it hit me really hard. I was there in the frat house watching "Family Guy" and I'm like oh yeah, this is the best I have ever felt, like ever. I could do this and nothing else for the rest of my life and it would be pretty chill. Yeah, totally. I've done acid like 10 times. And nine times it was a blast and then the 10th time it was really rough. Haven't done it since. Rough how? Like seeing how my brain functioned and how I thought about things. Observing exactly how my thinking operated moment to moment. (LAUGHING) It was pretty scary. I think I get you. Yeah, like how it musta been when people went and did outer space for the first time. And like astronauts turned around and beamed back down pictures of Earth back down to Earth for the first time and we saw ourselves just sitting there in all that blackness. (BOTH LAUGHING) Yeah. It's eye-opening in a lotta ways. I felt like I could see inside myself, like really inside. But it's just you in there, you know. (UPBEAT MUSIC) (LOCK CLATTERING) Hey. Hey. How was your day? Decent. Yeah? ALISON: Mmm hmm. Hi. It smells good in here. (ALISON SIGHS) Tips. Rad. Yeah. Any word on your audition? It's tomorrow morning. Cool. I'll help you after dinner. CHARLIE: Sweet. I need a shower. Okay, it'll be ready when you're done. I like you. I like you.

You could be a great detective if you weren't such a young rebellious hothead. You spend so much time stenographing the words of other people and yet you can't say to your woman how you really feel? CHARLIE: I wanna say it. Don't be afraid. I wanna say... ALISON: Go on. Damn it, Sara, this crime-fighting court stenographer loves you! Then they kiss and he grabs her and whatever, it's over. (CHARLIE SIGHS) ALISON: It's terrible. Yeah. - ALISON: I hope you get it. - (SIGHS) Me, too, Jesus. ALISON: What's it called? "The Stenographer". (ALISON LAUGHING) Hey, what episode are we on? I think the one before the season finale. Okay. (SLOW UPBEAT COUNTRY MUSIC) Cool. Gimme some of that. Mmm. You got it. (BOTH LAUGHING) You can do it. I think you should just feed me.

(BIRDS CHIRPING) (PHONE RATTLING) (PHONE RINGING) (BIRD CAWING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Hey, Adam. Oh hey, Charlie. Have you seen Alison out here? I haven't but I just got up, having my coffee. Okay, enjoy. Dude, do you have anything going on this morning? Uh, no, I'm just waiting for a package for Joanne. Okay, could you do me a huge favor? Hey, Charlie, hi. Hi there, Charlie. How's it going? DIRECTOR: Thanks for coming in, Charlie. It's gonna be really quick and painless. Have you got the scene? Yep, I'm all good to go. Stand here. DIRECTOR: There's fine. Now, I'll be reading the part of Sara and you feel free to move around, use the space, however you feel comfortable, okay? Great. Start now? DIRECTOR: We've also got chairs. Would you like to use a chair for any part of your... No, I'm good standing. DIRECTOR: Great. (GENTLE MUSIC) Start now? DIRECTOR: Well, let me give you a quick background just so you know this guy. First and foremost he's a stenographer. (FIST THUDDING) Fuck! (SOMBER VIOLIN MUSIC) Yo, what's going on? Hey, Charlie. No sign of Alison, sorry. Fuck, really dude? Fuck. What the fuck? Everything okay? I don't know, man. I just woke up and she was gone. (DOOR CLATTERING) Ali, you in here? (DOOR CREAKING) Hey, Dina, it's Charlie actually. Yeah, fine. Did you try to call Alison? Oh, hey Miss Quivers. Hey, Miss Quivers, have you seen Alison this morning? No, not this morning I haven't. ADAM: Charlie's looking for her. How long has he been looking for her? Uh, all morning I think. (SOMBER VIOLIN MUSIC) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Okay, so you wouldn't happen to know where she is then. Yeah, this is her phone. I have it, I just don't have her. I don't know. I just woke up this morning and she was gone, totally gone and the backdoor was wide open. No, I'm not panicking, it's just weird. That's a good idea, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll call you back. All right. Hey, Mrs. Quivers, have you seen Alison? No, I haven't. What you say, she's missing? No, she's not missing, she's just not here right now. Did I hear you say you left your backdoor wide open? Oh, hi, can I please speak to a manager? Hi, this is Charlie Radford. I'm Alison Browning's boyfriend. Alison isn't there, is she? No, no, no, I know she's not on the schedule. I thought maybe she got... If she comes in for any reason, have her call me immediately, okay? Thanks. Fuck. Charlie, what was it you said about your backdoor? It was wide open? Yeah, when I noticed that she was gone, I saw that it was open. Did you leave the door open last night. No, not that I remember. I'm pretty sure that I would have noticed that it was open when we went to bed. Do you normally leave the door open? No. Sweetie, why don't we call the police? What? No. Yeah, you think? Why not? Let's be safe not sorry, right? What would I even tell them? Yeah, I mean, don't you have to wait something like 24 hours to report a missing person? That's TV nonsense. (TENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Someone's gone and they're not supposed to be. You'd be a fool not to call the police. Hey, hold on a second. She's not a missing person, okay? She has just gone for a walk or something. She's weird. She likes to go for walks sometimes. MRS. QUIVER: Is there anybody else we can call? Maybe she's at a friend's house. I am her only fucking friend in this city! (TENSE VIOLIN MUSIC) Charlie, how 'bout this? We can all three sit out front. I have nothing to do this afternoon and we can wait on Alison together. Adam, do you have some coffee you can give us? ADAM: Yeah, sure thing. (SOMBER VIOLIN MUSIC) (INSECT CHIRPING) (DETECTIVE NORRIS SIGHS) Alison Browning, age 24, long brown hair, brown eyes, 5'5", last wearing black pajama shorts, white pajama top. Her shoes are still here? Yeah, as far as I can tell. How 'bout her sandals? Maybe they're missing or some kind of jogging shoe that perhaps you wouldn't have seen enough to know that it's missing. Maybe, I don't know. I don't think so. So you think that all her shoes are accounted for? I do. DETECTIVE NORRIS: And she wouldn't go out barefoot? No. Well, her phone is still here. Her keys are here, her credit card is here. Anything missing? Nothing, okay. Her bag, her wallet, her phone, her keys, her shoes, her clothes, all of it is still here, just not her. Last night she was acting peculiar, say something out of the ordinary? Was it anything there that gave you a feeling that something wasn't quite right? No. Any arguing? No. Did she seem down or depressed in any way? No. How 'bout ever? What does that have anything to do with it? Well, I was just trying to get this idea that, you know, maybe she was just feeling blue and she wanted to have some time to herself. She is not suicidal. Who asked that? She is just lost or got stuck somewhere or, fuck, I don't know, okay? But it's got nothing to do with her being blue. - Alison and I are good. - Okay, Mr. Radford, all right. There's no reason for her to just disappear like this. Look, I know that this is stressful, but if you just relax, then we can get to finding where your girlfriend is stuck and unstick her, all right? In the meanwhile, we're going to fingerprint your backdoor and we're gonna fingerprint some other spots in this apartment. And if anybody was here besides you and your girlfriend, we gonna find out about it. Now, my partner, he's going to your neighbors and we're gonna find out who's seen what. Now, we might just luck up and come across Alison having a hoagie down the block, huh? This is too much. I mean, this is a waste of time. She's gonna show up. People don't just disappear. Do you have a friend or anybody that can come to stay with you? Or, you know, wait here until Alison gets back? I'll be fine. She's gonna show up any minute and then I'll be totally embarrassed and it'll be a hell of a waste of time. Well, if it's a waste of time, no one will be happier than me. (GENTLE MUSIC) Look, I'll call you in a couple hours, Mr. Radford, okay? (LIVELY MUSIC) Thanks, Detective. Uh, again, I think she's gonna show up any minute. ♪ Well, I don't know why ♪ But you pour me one more time ♪ ♪ I'll lay back and that is not okay ♪ (BIRDS CHIRPING) (JULIANA WHIMPERING) Good morning. Sleep well? Mmm hmm, yep. I slept well. Wake up bear. (JULIANA SCREAMING) (LAUGHING) Stop. Do you just wanna sleep all day? CHARLIE: Yes. Well, we can't. We have a big Saturday plans. Well, then we messed up because Saturdays are not for plans, they're for sleeping through. Not today. Today we have to go to the farmer's market and then get sort of fresh goodies because tonight is our first dinner party. Get pumped. (JULIANA LAUGHING) All of your friends are coming over tonight. I don't have any friends with friends. JULIANA: Yes, you do and they love you very much and they want to see the house that you and your wife bought. What wife? I don't have a wife. JULIANA: In six months you will! (JULIANA SQUEALS) Oh ah! (JULIANA SCREAMING) (JULIANA LAUGHING) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Uh uh, thank you. JULIANA: Mmm hmm. (BOTH CHUCKLING) So, I'm gonna grill those hens you loved so much last time and I need to pick up those vegan sausages from that place on Sunset. So the point of this trip is to get fresh veggies and dessert. Got it. Woo. I just tripped. (JULIANA LAUGHING) Do you like cold veggies? Yes, sure. What kind of dessert should we get? I don't know, some type of pie. (SIGHS) Yeah, there's an awesome pie lady at this farmer's markets. Yeah? Delicious. Your favorite is cherry, right? Very good. Do you remember what my favorite nibble is? Uh um, shh don't tell me. It's that weird berry one - that we had that one... - Yeah! The one with it starts with an O. Um. - Oleoberry? - Close. Olallieberry. Ah, right. (JULIANA LAUGHING) Olallieberry. Olala, stupid name. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (RELAXED GUITAR MUSIC) Good. I love you. And I love you. (BIRDS CHIRPING) (CAR ENGINE REVVING) (PHONE RINGING) Hey, buddy, what's up? Uh wine. Yeah, we're cooking. (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) I am making lasagna and Juliana is grilling stuff. Yeah, vegan sausage for Dina, we got it covered. (SIGHS) I don't know, man. Juliana wanted you guys to come over before we started shooting because, mainly because, once we start shooting, shit's gonna get kinda crazy. Yeah, the sequel. No, "Stenographer III". (CHUCKLES) Yeah, as brilliant as the first two but who gives a fuck, right? It's exactly. Yeah, I owe those idiots my career. That, too. All right, dude, I'll talk to you later. See you guys in a bit. (CHARLIE COUGHING) Well, hello, my love. Hi, I just finished. Really, with the lasagna? Yeah, I just put it in the oven. Wow, you're fast. Good boy. Did you set up the picnic table and the barbecue? Oh, shit, I'm sorry. Charlie, really? I asked you to do that first. I got carried away with the lasagna, you know. I'll do it now, okay? But I asked you to do it first. I know, I'm sorry. Relax, nobody's gonna get here for a few hours. But we also have to take out all the chairs. (SIGHS) It'll be fine, all right? You go upstairs. Go upstairs and take your shower. And when you're done showering, it'll all be completed. (BIRDS CHIRPING) Okay. CHARLIE: And I love you. Love you, too. Hey, Charlie. Yeah. What's with the package in the foyer? Oh yeah, I don't know. There's no return address. I think it's just like weird fan mail or something. Do you just want me to throw it away? Um... JULIANA: It's not a bomb, is it? I don't know. I can't think of anybody that would wanna blow me up, can you? No, but I mean, you're kind of a celebrity now with the "Court Stenseler" movies. "Court Stenographer". Whatever. People know our address? How would they find that out? The internet. What about the internet? Well, it's all up there. What is? All of it. It's probably just like a practical joke or some shit from Bill. You know, I'll open it up and snakes - will come popping out. - Snakes? Not actual snakes, probably. (JULIANA SIGHS) It doesn't sound like snakes. Don't shake it. I already shook it once and nothing happened, okay? Stop. I'm gonna open it. Hold on. (LIGHT SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Yeah, that's probably a good idea. Thank you. All right. (TAPE ZIPPING) (PAPER RUSTLING) "You deserve this"? Maybe we should just throw it out. (PAPER RUSTLING) (JULIANA GASPING) So, do you know anybody who might send you a foot? Is that a joke? No, sir, it isn't. No, I don't know anybody that would wanna send me a foot. And some leg. It also had some leg. Yeah, I got a look as my partner bagged her. It was kinda hacked off at about the calf I'd say. Oh my God. (SIGHS) You don't think it's real, do you, not like a real foot? Oh, it's a foot all right. Well, it used to be at one point. Yeah, it's been pickled in some kinda concoction and then wrapped up. Mummified you might say. The fellas at the lab, they'll have the final word and what's happened to it. My partner's driving it over there right now. Yeah, you betcha, a foot's a foot. I think I'm gonna be sick. Well, like I say, the guys at the lab will take a look and see what's what... Detective, don't you think that we should be worried? The note said, "You deserve this." That sounds like a threat. Well. It is tippy-toeing around being threatening, I'll grant you that. Is that a fucking joke? I'm nothing if not deadly serious, Mr. Radford. It's just that first I wanna know what's what with the foot. I'm no forensics expert. I mean, I don't want us jumping to conclusions and getting all worked up based on my amateur opinion of that is or is not a foot. Didn't you just say "a foot's a foot"? JULIANA: And some leg. Well, we're gonna see about all that. What, so that's it? I'm gonna go chat to your neighbors, see if anyone saw who left a foot box. If I find out anything, I'll let you know. Sir, we're having a dinner party - this evening. - Juliana, not the fucking dinner party. And we were just wondering if it was safe for us to have people over. I don't see why not. I mean, stay vigilant, don't go leaving your door unlocked at night. But like you folks say, I mean, there's no one out there with any reason to wanna hurt the two of you. I'd wager it's some fan who took to grave robbing one night or some prankster who's good at making fake limbs with Silly Putty, fool an old cop like me. Neither is a particularly settling prospect but neither too dangerous either. Want my opinion? You kids enjoy your party. JULIANA: Thank you, sir. DETECTIVE LANGE: It's my job. I'll have a cruiser pass by periodically, check on the residence for a couple evenings. Sound good? Hold on. DETECTIVE LANGE: Have a lovely evening. JULIANA: Thanks again, sir. Thanks, yeah. Hold on. Hey, hold on a second. Um... What's the matter? I don't know if this has anything to do with anything. - Um... - Yeah? I had a girlfriend three years ago. I had a girlfriend and she disappeared. She went missing. DETECTIVE LANGE: Really? JULIANA: What? Yeah, one morning she disappeared from our apartment. And I filed a police report right away but she never showed up again. She never contacted me or her parents or anybody. I don't think the investigation was officially closed. Hmm. What was her name? Alison Browning. A-L-I-S-O-N. (UPBEAT MUSIC) DETECTIVE LANGE: Yeah, yeah, I got it. (CANS CLICKING AND HISSING) Do you feel like talking yet? (SIGHS) You loved her. No, I didn't. Do you think that the foot is... No, I do not. Man, today has been a crazy day for you what with the grocery shopping and the cooking and the foot thing and the cops and, but tomorrow we'll have friends over and you'll bounce right back. Okay.

What are you doing? I'll be fine. I'm not going anywhere, I don't gotta drive. I'm just here with my lovely fiance (GLASSES CLINKING) eating lasagna. God, listen to you. You are going to be a handful tonight. No, I'll be the perfect gentleman until I get you upstairs and then, I'll be the perfect scoundrel. You're being weird. I don't like it. (CHUCKLES) You don't really think I'm weird, do you? JULIANA: You're being weird right now. (SIGHS) Yeah, what about you? You're not weird? Not right now. No, I think I'm being fairly normal. You're never weird, right? Not now, not ever, right? You're just a good girl. Right? What? Have you ever done anything bad? Bad? Of course, we're all human. What are you talking about? Have you ever done anything so bad you thought you might go to hell for it? What? (SIGHS) Never mind. You're right, I drink too fast. Are you all right? Is this about the foot? I just gotta eat. Charlie, you are going to puke. What the fuck do you know about what I'm gonna do? Excuse me? (GENTLE GUITAR MUSIC) (CHARLIE RETCHING) It's okay, babe. Just let it all out. (CHARLIE GAGGING) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (PHONE RINGING) Hello. DETECTIVE LANGE: Mr. Radford, this is Detective Lange. Yeah. DETECTIVE LANGE: We spoke yesterday about the foot you received. Yeah. DETECTIVE LANGE: This is Mr. Radford? Yeah. DETECTIVE LANGE: Been trying to get in touch with you all day, Mr. Radford. Listen, there's a lot of information that you really need to be made aware of. Okay. DETECTIVE LANGE: Okay, so listen, what's your schedule looking like today. I mean, what are you doing right now? Right now? Yeah, right now. (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) I mean, have you got anything pressing right now, Mr. Radford? 'Cause to me looks like you're sitting around in your goddamn bathrobe. Sorry, Mr. Radford, I've been trying to reach you all day. Important things are happening, Mr. Radford, and you're sleeping right through it. We have some important information here. Hello there, Mr. Radford. (SOMBER PIANO MUSIC) Do you mind if we sit for a minute? I'll stand. My knees. All right if I smoke? Charlie, there's some information I'd like to share with you. Actually, to be totally clear, it's the Bureau that wants to share this information. I'm just the messenger. The limb that was left at your door. It was, in fact, a human limb. It belonged to a young woman. Now, we don't have a full report yet... Uh, Detective, can I have a cigarette? DETECTIVE LANGE: Sure, kid. (BIRDS CHIRPING) You're saying Alison. (SOMBER MUSIC) Yes. What are the chances she's still alive? We don't think they're good. So she could still be alive, just chained up in a fucking dungeon somewhere. I don't wanna give you any false hope, Charlie. None of these people have ever come back. 15 different Americans, they all received these body parts. And they all received these notes. And the other thing that they all share in common is that exactly three years prior to receiving these packages someone they loved very dearly completely and absolutely vanished from their lives. Now, we've contacted Fred Browning and Andrew Browning. They're going to assist us in the DNA tests. We're gonna find out for certain if the foot did indeed belong to Alison. But we've told them what I'm telling you right now which is the FBI strongly believes their daughter was the victim of a serial murderer who's been evading capture and identification for over four decades. Is this a fucking joke? Jesus Christ, he didn't fucking mail that shit. He walked up here and put it there. Somebody had to have seen him. Yeah, you'd think so, right? What do you mean, "You'd think so"? You're telling me nobody saw anything? So far no. No one saw anyone leave the package. But I have to tell you, Charlie, that based on this particular criminal's track record, that's not surprising. He's very good at what he does and going unseen is the key to his ability to. Many of these people were taken right out of their beds laying next to their loved totally unaware. I'm trying to tell you that this man, this monster, he is so focused, dead set on accomplishing his evil that even good men, strong men, won't always be able to stop him. It's just the way of the world unfortunately. (SOMBER VIOLIN MUSIC) But you know, it goes with the territory. It's hell out there and it's every man for himself. That's not the way it should be. (LAUGHING) A lotta things aren't the way they should be. DINA: But California's different. This is Hollywood. It's supposed to be open and free and liberated. Am I wrong? Liberated doesn't mean civilized. Look at the Middle East, right? Give 'em a little bit of liberty and watch heads get chopped off. I know a bunch of Pakistanis from my dad's business. Nicest people you ever wanna meet. I think the guy at my deli who gives me my coffee in the morning, he's Pakistani. He's Indian. DINA: I finally got some Indian food I liked. CARA: Did you try that new vegan Indian place? BILL: Ugh, we did. Not a fan. DINA: He didn't like it. I thought it was divine. BILL: I was farting all night. (ALL LAUGHING) (BILL MIMICKING FARTING) Charlie. You all right over there, buddy? Uh, yeah, what was the joke? The moment's passed. Charlie, did you try the pie? This pie is delicious. I got it at the farmer's market. JERRY: The Pie Lady. Yeah. I know her. (DINA CHUCKLING) I knew this pie as soon as I tasted it. This is delicious. Charlie, you need to try a piece of this pie. This one's cherry? JULIANA: Yep, that one is cherry. It's Charlie's favorite. CARA: What's the one we haven't tried? JULIANA: It's olallieberry, it's my favorite pie. JERRY: What the hell is an olallieberry? (CHUCKLES) You know, not exactly sure but it is delicious. Charlie, would you do us the honors? (TENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Would you please slice the olallieberry pie so we can all have a piece? What's wrong? (SOMBER ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Charlie. (BILL LAUGHING) BILL: What are you doing, man? JERRY: He's drunk. - (PIE THUDDING) - Ah! (MEN LAUGHING) Charlie, are you crazy. (PIE THUDDING) (JERRY GASPING) (DINA AND BILL LAUGHING) - (DINA GASPING) - Oh! RACHEL: Well, I had a really good time tonight. Yeah, me, too. The restaurant was really great. Yep, I like that place. You know a lot of good places. Everywhere we've gone so far has been really, really special. CHARLIE: Glad you've been having a good time. I have a good time hanging out with you. CHARLIE: Thanks. I like you. CHARLIE: You're sweet. Listen, maybe next time instead of going to a restaurant, I could cook for you? I'm really good. That sounds really nice. Yeah, we should definitely do that. Yeah, for sure. CHARLIE: Cool. Cool. Well... I like you. Good night, Rachel. Good night, Charlie.
