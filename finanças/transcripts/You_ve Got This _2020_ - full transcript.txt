NETFLIX PRESENTS Five more minutes. Good morning, badger. -Hi, baby. -Hi, honey. Time to get up. Well, badger… It's too bad. I wanted to take you out to have green chilaquiles for breakfast. With some delicious motuleño eggs. But I guess I'll have to take Mila instead. Although I also wanted to give you some morning kisses, all over my badger's neck. But, oh well, I guess today's not the day. No, don't tickle me! -No, honey, no! Please. -What? Today is my meeting. Come on, let's go. -No, wait. -What? I don't know what else to try! -Oh, sweetie. -You have to calm down. Then you can calm the baby. Honey, do you remember Valentina Reina? I do. She's the Inmujeres director. -Yes. -Yes, of course. -She's pregnant. -Again? That's wonderful, right? Doesn't she have like 26 kids? -Four. -I couldn't even handle one. -It's just about being organized. -That's not true. Yes, plus, you women come equipped with the maternity chip. Yeah, right. -Yes. -Yes, just like that woman over there. -Honey… -So well equipped. -Hey… -Please, just look at her. What if it's not just the flu but one of those murderous viruses? -You mean mutant? -No, murderous viruses. -No. Bety. -You don't have it, baby. Just imagine that multiplied by four. The poor woman needs rescuing. -I'll do it, watch. -What? No. I didn't mean that. See what a good dad I'd be. -No… -Hi! -Honey, let me be. -Alejandro! I'm sorry. This is embarrassing. What a cute baby! What's his name? Alaia. -Alaia, it's a girl! -Alejandro! May I? -I'm good with babies. -Do you have an ID? You could be a kidnapper or something. I have my license. Will that do? -Calm down already. -Relax. We're joking. -There, there. -It's because he's calm, you see? -Here, this is your coffee. -Thanks. How can you drink it with no sugar? No, Laurita! Laurita, no. What did we agree on? Those are untouchable, sacred. -I was just dusting them off. -No, what for? Look, this is a 1982 limited edition. All right. Should I clean it or not? -No, don't. What for? -Okay. Thanks, Laurita, so nice of you. -Excuse me, then. -Go ahead. -What's up, dude? -What's up, man? Not so good. Mussolini won't stop nagging. She wants the campaign proposal ASAP. I know, dude. I even had a nightmare about her. Yes. I dreamed I was in my Blue Period working on this avant-garde commercial. Suddenly, Mussolini shows up, furious, and she bites me. That's when I woke up. Yeah, a scary start to the day. It must suck being her, no? I mean, not being loved by anyone, not loving anyone… Her whole life revolving around that dog of hers… Why do you think she didn't have kids? She didn't want to or-- Look, some women aren't willing to sacrifice their beauty and talent and get forgotten about, you know? What? They feel the world can't do without their superior intelligence. How can I put it? Yes, the world needs them. Sure, yes, like Ceci, my wife. She doesn't want kids, just like Sylvia. We talk about her a lot. We both admire her so much. -Stop. -Sylvia! Didn't see you there. -We were just talking about-- -You talk a lot, don't you? The pitch for this project is coming up. I need you to focus, Alejandro. -Yes, perfect. -And you, Rafa? If you want us to renew your visa, remind me why we hired you, okay? Okay. Undoubtedly, the most solid project is micro-hydropower plants in Chiapas. It requires a 50-million-dollar investment with a 12 to 14% yield. But the best part is the positive impact we'll generate in the surrounding areas. We won't affect the ecosystem, we won't be burning fossil fuels, but we'll be generating jobs while producing clean energy. All that will position us as a socially responsible company. Not bad. We just need to look into regulatory approval. I checked. They are granting permits. Local authorities are keen on private investment. Great. When you've thought of an investor, we'll talk about it. I've already lined up some potential partners in the US who are interested in funding this. Well, with Ceci in charge, we partners can simply go play golf. Or tennis, so you don't waste so much water. Tennis! Hey, this is a major investment for our clients. I mean, I won't go to the board without a clear, serious, and verified analysis of the region's political, economic, social and tax situation. Actually, Guillermo, I wanted to tell you, I sent you all an email this morning with a report on everything you're asking for. Well, I have to go. -What do you think? -I love it, man! You do? For real? Oh, no… I'm embarrassed for you, Rafa. It's the same commercial we've seen all our lives. You guys really don't get it. Wait, what are you talking about? It has a very feminist message. What? It's saying women can be anything they want to be and also mothers. -To me, this is super revolutionary. -Right? Listen, you feminist fellas. It would be really revolutionary if there was a man in the commercial. A guy taking care of his children and the housework. Aren't you cute? I'll see you later. Totally radical. She has a point. -Let's get out of here. -No, we're not going anywhere. We have to give this our all. I'm not letting Guillermo pull some stupid stunt and kill my project. No way. Are we staying until late? I am. You should work less. This isn't living. What could you be doing that's more productive? Drinking a beer! Mexican craft beer, so the beer industry can keep providing thousands of jobs to thousands of Mexicans, thus boosting the nation's economy. You earned it. Go get some beers. Someone just got knocked up with the double six tile. -Yes. -Rafael! What? I was about to play it. Listen… getting pregnant isn't the end of the world, right? It's just the end of sex, of romantic vacations, of savings… Shall we give the kids away? No, I'd never do that. We should raffle them off. Dude, you couldn't spend a day away from your children. Four beers. -Alicia! -Thanks. I almost forgot, I brought some clothes my kids outgrew, for your baby. Great, thanks a lot. -Alicia, how old is Alan? -One. A year? That's awesome. I can't wait to have a baby. You should! -Oh, sorry, Alicia. -Yes… I want one, but Ceci doesn't. How is she? We haven't seen her in ages. She's fine. You know, always working. If she worked less, our family could become bigger, but you know. Why is it you want a baby? What do you mean "why"? To love him, to play with him… to watch Star Wars together, right? Not to mention support him, educate him, feed him… -What a party pooper! -Yes, hey… There's always room for one more. Do you want anything else? -No. -No? All set? -Thanks. -Thanks. Are you okay, man? Yes, why? -Nothing. -Well, I give up. It's been declined, but it's not the card. The signal has been off. -Do you want me to try again? -Yes, please. Alicia, how old are you? Eighteen. -Eighteen? -Well, almost eighteen. But don't tell anyone or I'll get fired. No, I wouldn't. I won't tell anyone. What do you do about childcare? I mean, who helps you? Alicia, you can't leave him in the kitchen, he could get burned. Oh, Alan, I can never count on you, huh? Hello! Oh, come here. Here, let me grab him for a while. It's okay now. Oh, no. You're good with babies. -I am, right? -Yeah. I have some sort of chip, right? There it is. -Here's your card. -Thank you. Look. Here's a tip for you. Why so much? Well, for you to buy something for Alan. It's okay. Thank you. No problem. Listen, if you need some help taking care of him… call me. Here's my number. Just call me, okay? -Okay. -Bye, Alan! Take care. Say goodbye. Say bye! See you. See that? Good morning, honey. Good morning, honey. Good morning. God, you look so pretty when you wake up. That's not true. Especially after working late last night. I love you just the way you are, puffy-eyed and all. And I love you just like this, sleepy and handsome. Hey… What if we have a baby? What if we don't? -Come on! -No. A tiny one, fat, and chubby to cuddle and bite. No, not to bite. -Okay, so you can breastfeed him then. -No, no breastfeeding either. No, besides, we're perfect just the way we are, honey. -We've discussed this. -When? I don't remember ever discussing it. -Come on in, Cecilia, have a seat. -Yes. What is it, Mr. Gonzalo? Great job. Congratulations. The hydroelectric project was approved. Thank you. Thank you so much! I'm glad you're happy. -You deserve it. -Thank you. Cecilia… Do you know why I never had kids? Because you couldn't have created this company if you'd spent the seed money on tuition? No. No, my wife and I couldn't have kids. I've regretted it all my life. -I'm sorry. -With that said… -Yes. -I want you to listen to me and think your answer through. Yes. I'll soon retire. And I have no kids to inherit my business. Maybe you could help me find the right person to pass on the torch. I mean, sure, I'll help you. -I'll give you some names. -No. No? What about you, Cecilia? You, for example. Where do you see yourself in five years? I… I see myself… right there, Mr. Gonzalo. Wonderful. Then we have a lot to talk about. -Yes. -Consider this a formal proposal. We'll work out the details later. We have a video conference at 3:00. Excellent timing, Guillermo. I was just talking to Cecilia about her taking my place. And yes. She's interested. Great! Well, Ceci. You'll become very familiar with business trips. Yes, I've taken plenty. And you'd be willing to move to another country if necessary? -Yes, of course. -Okay, we'll talk about this later. I just wanted to see if she was interested. Well, great. All we need is the board's approval in the next meeting. Cecilia's results will convince them. Yes, they will. Let's go. Thank you. So, you made your choice. Darling. Oh, honey! I have something to tell you. Oh, yummy. -Honey? -What? I can't stop thinking. About what? I want a baby. -Oh, Alex! -What? I want an apartment in Manhattan, a million dollars and world peace. No, I'm serious. So am I. Terrible timing. Whenever I want to talk about this, it's never a good time. No, and especially not now. You and I agreed on having a baby someday. We said maybe, one day, but not right now, and not anytime soon. Oh, right. It's better to wait until you're 40, spend all our money on fertility treatments and just hope the baby's healthy. Foul play. Hey, sorry, but right now-- Honey, I'm still very young. I have lots of plans. A baby? Right now? No way. I have too much on my plate. I'd help you. It's not about helping, it's about wanting. -Exactly, I want to! -But I don't. Okay, why not? Honey… please don't pressure me. You know how hard I've worked to reach my goals. I'm reaching them. Do you get it? Ouch, so… I'm not part of your goals? -You're just looking for a fight. -No, I mean it. You're spending too much time on work and not enough on us. -No. -Yes. -I don't think so. -I do. Well, I don't! I think I'm spending the right amount of time on it. -The right amount? -Exactly. Besides, with or without kids, I'm not going to give up work. -Okay. -Okay. Want to have dinner? I'm not hungry, thanks. This one's for the company partner. It's not official yet. Yes, but you're the coolest. You'll get the spot. What did Alex say? Believe it or not, I haven't told him yet. Why not? Because he's obsessed with wanting to be a dad. -That's great news! -No, it's not good news at all. He's like a stubborn kid whining about it. "Mom, can you get me a puppy? I swear I'll pick up its poop!" And in the end, moms end up doing it all. I think the world is overpopulated, and no one should have any kids, ever. Whoa, what are you trying to tell me? Well, it's too late for you. You can't give it back. But this baby and that's it. -Your turn? -Well, to be honest, I don't think having a family and devoting your life to raising good human beings is so bad for the world. For instance, you produce great bread, and I produce great children. Yes, but I'm not the croissant's wife, or the cupcakes' mom, for example. Am I the croissant's wife? No, you're Fernando's wife. You're an asshole if you see me as Fernando's wife. But I couldn't care less. I'm living the life I always wanted. That's exactly it. You're a mom with a family because it's what you've always wanted. But not me. I never dreamed about getting married. You know that. I married Alex because that's what he wanted, and today, on our third anniversary, I couldn't be happier. But… I don't know if I want kids. You never want to have kids? I don't know. Hello, honey. Hi, baby. Can we talk now? Yes. But open your gift first. What? Happy anniversary! Come on, open it. -Happy anniversary, honey! -Yeah. You bought me a gift! No, I made it myself. -No. -Yes, look. Okay, one, two, three. No way! It's amazing! Really? You like it? It's amazing, honey. How can you be so talented and so handsome? Can you forgive me? -What for? -I didn't get you anything. -Oh, don't worry about it. -I forgot. Well, you can take me to dinner sometime or something. I may have left you a teeny surprise downstairs. What? I feel like the corniest couple in Mexico on these matching bikes. Want a race? -They were on sale, right? -Of course, honey. Here, honey. -It has booze in it. -Perfect. -Hey, honey-- -Hey, badger-- -What? -No, you go first. -No, you go. -No. -Go, go. -No, you go first. Okay. No, I'll go first. -Okay, go. -Well, I was thinking… -What? -That bike… It would look great with a baby seat on it, right? -Oh, honey! -What? Why can't you understand? I'm not ready, hon. Honey, you don't need to be ready. Women have a natural talent that triggers when they become mothers. That's the most sexist thing you've said since we met. -The most. -How? No, look-- It's like if I said you must like soccer just because you're a man. -Well, I do like soccer. -That's not… -What team does Chicharito play in? -Well… -Winchester. -No. -Rochester? -No, Manchester, and that was ages ago. -Well, I almost got it. -No. I've been trying to tell you something for days, but you won't let me. And I want to be a dad, but you won't let me. -Badger, why do you want to fight? -No. -Darling, it's our anniversary. -I know, I don't want to fight. -So? -I want a baby that has your smile. -You can't blame me for that. -Look at my smile. Okay, fine, I'll shut up. Okay. Mr. Gonzalo offered to make me a partner in the company. What? Why didn't you tell me? Because you didn't let me, with all the baby talk. Honey, that's great! Congratulations! Thanks. Though it does entail some changes. Wait, no, what changes? Well, I'll be at work more hours, traveling. And if they make me partner, they'll announce it at the Valle convention. -Okay. -It'll be great. You're coming, right? -Well, I don't know-- -All dressed up. -What? -Formal wear. -No, wait, how formal? -Well, a sharp suit. Sharp? Okay. -Sharp! -Honey, I need your support. Honey… together from here to China. Hi. -Hi. -What are you doing here? Hey… remember you said you'd look after him if I needed help? -Well, I did, but when I said-- -It's an emergency. I need you to take care of him for me. Three days. -What? Three days? No, wait… -Yes. -You promised, remember? -No. -Say hi! -Hi, Alan. Well, yes. But I can't. -I'm swamped. -Alex, please. I swear you're my only option. Okay, but is everything all right? Yes. All good, but I don't have time to explain right now. I have to go, but it'll only be three days. -I brought his clothes. -Okay, yes. Well… all right. Thanks a lot, really. Thank you. -No, wait-- -I promise it'll only be three days. Only three days. You've got this. Hi. Hey… Where am I going to hide you? Hello. -No coffee today? -No, sorry, no coffee today. Good morning. -Hi. -Are you moving or what? -What? No, just some things for work. -For work? -Yes. -Why so big? -Well, you know. -It moved. What? No, it didn't. It moved, dude! -No, I didn't see anything. -What's in there? -Shush! -What's in there? -Sit! -What's in there? No, wait! What is this? What do you think? A baby. Is it yours? How could it be mine? It's Alicia's, the waitress. -She asked me to babysit for three days. -Okay now! You know how many emails I've received about this project? Exactly. Zero. The deadline is at 12:00. -So, get to work, okay? -Okay. -Okay. -Yeah. Okay. What are you going to do? What do you mean? Take care of him for three days, and well… Ceci's going to kill me. I don't know what I was thinking. No, you clearly weren't thinking. What was I supposed to do? Alicia turned up, handed me the baby and ran off. Anyway, I think all a baby really needs is to be loved, right? And Ceci will understand. Actually, maybe this is what she needs. To have a baby around and get over her fears, right? Come on. Help me. -I'll turn up the music. -Yeah. -Good idea. Yes. -Cover it up. I'll put some music on. It's too quiet in here. Okay, guys, what's going on? Didn't the plumber come yesterday? Yes, he did. That smell is so intense. It's making my eyes sting. I'll go get Laurita. Thanks. And who turned up the music? I told you, it's unbearable. It smells like the fjord of Chochaca dump. "Bordo de Xochiaca." Exactly, the garbage dump. It's killing me! -Do something, man. -What? I don't know, anything. Alicia only gave me clothes, she didn't give me diapers. I know! Take this. Look. Go to the pharmacy and get some diapers. -I'll see you in the bathroom. -Yes. -Hi, how are you? -Hi, good and you? Good. You cut your hair, didn't you? No, my ponytail's at the front. I'll get them for you. -Hey, a new organic lubricant came in-- -No. I need something else. -What? -Uh… Diapers. Diapers? You bought bad condoms. -Yes, you know-- -No, no. Are they for you? No, they're for a friend. Oh, right, you need adult diapers. No, wait, I can explain. A friend of mine has a baby. Oh, okay. What size do you need? I don't know, baby size. How old is the baby? How should I know? It's a baby, just a baby. Oh, I see. You go about getting people pregnant, and you don't even know how old the kids are. -Ma'am. -Don't call me ma'am. Hey, do the math. When did you sleep with the mom? Add nine months to that date. Then count the number of months between then and now. That's how old your kid is, okay? -I'm sure these will work. -Yes, I'm sure. I can't believe this, for fuck's sake! OUT OF SERVICE Alex. It's out of service, asshole. What? Don't be an idiot. I put it there. Wait, I'll let you in. Okay. No, this is disgusting, bro. It looks like dulce de leche! Hand me the wipes. This isn't cleaning him. What wipes? I only got diapers, bro. You didn't get wipes? Dude, you ask for diapers, I get you diapers. Okay, hand me a diaper. -Wait. There. -Here. Here you go. No! -Take it! -This is disgusting, dude! Come here. No, Rafa. -What? -These are newborn diapers. -What is this? -I don't know, bro. You never told me. I'm clueless. Yuck! -He's eating his poop! -No, Alan, not the poop! No, wait. The poop! Okay. -Don't let him eat it. -Get bigger diapers! No. No! A woman? Taking your place? Do you think she can do it? That her husband will let her? Before you know it, she'll come in with a belly this big and leave us hanging. No, Guillermo, no. Cecilia would never abandon her work. She's very committed. Plus, her vision will bring a lot to the company. You're the majority shareholder. Me? I wouldn't leave it all in the hands of a woman. They're very emotional. Just think about it. Think about it? Honey? Honey! Come on. She isn't home yet. Come on. Look. This room… is yours for now, okay? You'll stay in here. This is a very delicate moment, okay? I need you to help me. Don't make any noise until I tell Ceci everything. Okay? Okay, great. She's home. Stay here. I'll be right back. Hi, honey. -Why is the music so loud? -It's great. Scale of one to ten, how much do you love me? Well, right now? Around eight. But you could earn extra points. Well, speaking of earning and losing points… -Yep? -You'd forgive me, no matter what, right? What did you do, badger? Nothing. I brought a baby home. What? Honey, turn down the volume. I can barely hear you. No, I love this part. I think I left the computer on. I'll be right back. Hold on. No! No! What did you do? What did you do? No! Hold on. I haven't told her yet. Okay, come on. Come here. Come here. Sit here. There you go. Look. Here. Quantum Theory. Have a read of this. Stay still here, please. Okay? With Snoopy. There. I haven't told her yet. Hold on. You said you'd help me. Please, okay? Done. -Yes. -Honey… -What? -Look… I think it's import-- No! I want to talk about our family situation. That's great. Now that you mention this family thing… Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but… we have a little one here. A little problem. There's no food in the house. We have to go to the market, honey. -All we have are radishes. -I know, honey. I'd love to always buy the groceries and be the perfect wife, but I have so much work that I just don't have time. -No, honey… you are perfect. -I'm not. You are, and when the time comes, you'll be a great mother. No, listen. That's what I wanted to talk to you about. What? If I was infertile… -What? -Would I no longer be the perfect wife? No, not at all. -Okay. -You'd still be perfect. Yes, we could adopt a baby, and problem solved. And what if I never wanted kids? Not adopted, or biological, or any kind? I think that would be selfish. You'd only be thinking about you, and not about us. No! Besides, we're all traumatized because of our parents. I don't want to traumatize a baby. Know what I mean? You, for example. You hate your mom. -I don't hate my mom. -I mean, you do. -I don't hate my mom. -You do, a bit. No, I mean, I would've loved for her to be there for my school plays, or my graduation, or my work exams, or our wedding, which she didn't come to. Because she was working. And right now, I have so much work, I don't even have time for myself. Well, we need to spend more time together. Yes. Do our homework. And think about the baby thing. Homework? Yes. Have kids? No. Why? Oh, honey. A baby would be the worst thing that could happen to me right now. -Really? -The worst thing. -The worst? -The worst. A cat. How do you know? Well… because it meowed, right? -Oh, no. -Yes. What? I can feel my throat closing up. You see? It is a cat. Yes. You're having a reaction. -Oh, this is awful. -Stay here. Wait for me. I'll go check. -Okay? -No, not a cat! Baby! Come here. Come with me. We're leaving. Badger? Badger? It is a cat. -No. -Yes, I've got it cornered on the couch. -Yes, go into the bedroom. -Yes, okay. -Close the door. -Yes. Then what? I'll tell you once I've got rid of it. Shut the door. Honey, is everything okay? I'm taking it outside! I'll let you know! Okay! Be careful! This is awful. I hate cats. Say, "Hi, Rafa, can we come in?" No. -Yes. -No. -Yes. -No. -Rafa you can't leave us on the street. -Not now. -What do you mean? -I can't. Let me in. -No, listen. -I'll explain. -I hid him from Ceci, and then… -No, no… Hi. Hello. Lorena, Alex. -The Cookie Monster. -So cute. Is it yours? -Yes, it's his. -No, it's his. -What? -Accept it. -No. -Is it yours, Rafa? -It is. -I swear it's not. So why say it's his? -No… -You know him. -When he has a date, I'm stuck with him. -I can explain. -I'll explain everything. -Really? Go on, explain. You know what? You don't owe me an explanation. I don't get it, and you two clearly need to talk. -Sorry. -I'll go. I don't know the baby. I don't even know his name! You're shameless. Yes, shameless, denying your own baby. I can't believe it. Wait, I'll see you at the pool party tomorrow, right? Yes, sure. Pool party? Yes, asshole. Pool party! Did you see how hot she was? Yes, but we need a bed. Here, take this. CECI - 5 MISSED CALLS -Ceci. Here, grab him. -What? -Take him. -Anything else? Say, "Please, Uncle Rafa." All right? Hey, what happened? I'm waiting for you. Hi, honey. Sorry, I was on another call. I have a work emergency and I'll have to stay all night working with Rafa. Okay, fair enough. Work is work. -So, what happened in the end? -With what? Well, with the cat. Oh, the cat? I left the cat at a vet's. With a very nice and patient doctor. Go to sleep already. Holy shit, what did you give him, Red Bull? Chocolate. Oh, that was stupid, Alejandro. We should turn the TV on for him. What? No, you know I can't sleep with the TV on. But you can sleep with this tantrum? Do you have selective hearing, asshole? I need my rest. I live off my ideas, Alejandro, and if I don't get rest, I can't come up with good ideas. Aren't you sensitive? If I'm not getting any sleep, then no one is, bro. What are you doing? Turn the light off and stop yelling or he'll never fall sleep. Yell? Does it seem like I'm yelling, Alejandro? Yes, you're making a mountain out of a molehill. I'm glad you mention mountains, because I've moved mountains for this kid. You've done nothing. You haven't helped me. What? I haven't helped you? Who went to the store for his bottle? His what? His bottle, jackass, and it's cold outside! Yes, I was changing his diaper. Who bought the diapers? You, but I paid for them. No, wait. Providing for a child doesn't make you a dad, bro. You haven't cleaned up a single poop! And you weren't humiliated at the pharmacy! You didn't lose the hottest chick on Tinder! I did it all for you. What have you done for me? You've done nothing for me! Nothing! Look, the water jug is empty. Not a drop of water in it, and you don't fill it up. Why don't you fill it up? Fill it up! All right. I'll fill the water jug. -Unbelievable. -Watch him. -Yes. -Don't let him see you cry. No. I'm sorry, I know it's not your fault. It's that asshole's fault. It's his fault. Hey! Hey! What is it? Listen, do you know how you're going to hide him tomorrow? You can't keep him in a box with holes in for three days. You can find something better to hide him in, don't you think? Like what? Leave it to me. But first, fill up the jug. Don't be a jerk. All the way to the top. Go to sleep, come on. -Hi, good morning. -Good morning. How's it going? Hello. What's up, Erica? Jackie, I'm sorry, no coffee today either. Yeah, no problem. Jeez, what a hassle. What's that? Samples of eco-friendly packing materials. Yes, for the diaper campaign. That way, at least the packaging is green, right? You asked me to show you why you sponsored my visa, right? Excellent. It seems you aren't worthless after all. But I want an impeccable presentation first thing Monday morning. Yes, of course. And if you make me lose this client, Alejandro, I'm cutting your bonus. -Yes. -Okay? Okay. -Okay. -Okay. Man, we did it! Hey, great proposal! I love it. Such a cool idea. Yes, it was Rafa's idea. You know him. Let's see. Wow! -The baskets are awesome. -They are, right? Look. I hope you didn't rip off the craftsmen. -No. -On the contrary, this is to support them. -Want some coffee? -The diapers would go in here? -Yes, sure. -Yes, well… -Amazing. -Different, huh? You know I love handcrafts. I always wanted to work with artisans. -Want some breakfast? -Cocoa? No! I knew you were up to something! What is this? Is it for the campaign or what? How about we go to the kitchen and we'll let you in on it? -Okay, see you there. -Yes. -Great. -Okay. Come on. Are you totally insane? If Mussolini finds out you brought a baby to the office, she'll fire you. Remember what happened to Amanda, when she breastfed in the lobby. -Sylvia hates kids. -And every living thing. -No. -We need you to help us. Me? -Yes, to hide him. -Come on! Please, Jackie, you're the only one who can help us. It's only one day. His mom is picking him up tomorrow. Jackie, please. Okay. But we have to let the whole office in on this. How? I know. I'll send an encrypted message. BABY IN OFFICE. WHISTLE IF YOU SEE MUSSOLINI! EDIBLE MESSAGE - DESTROY Are you exploring, little guy? Yes! You like it? You too? Being a father is really my thing. But you haven't done anything. How so? You aren't born a dad, you become one. So, earn that title. Hey, but I'm doing everything right. Aren't I? Aren't I doing everything right? Hey, jackass. Hey, I asked you a question! What? I don't know what you're talking about, bro. I'm checking out a hot girl on Tinder, okay? You do know you'll end up alone, fat, with your hair dyed, and still chasing young women? No. Not fat. Yes, yes… -What is this? -I need a signature. I know, but the meeting isn't right now. What's going on? Get back. You'll stress out my dog. Oh, honey, it's okay. The Gestapo left. All clear. As you know, our international partners are coming in two weeks to the annual meeting in Valle de Bravo. Yes. And instead of me presenting the projects… I would like you to do it, so they see you in action. Yes, absolutely. Of course. Mr. Gonzalo, thanks for the opportunity. I won't let you down. You've earned it, Cecilia. You've earned it. One more thing. If this gets confirmed, you'll have to spend a year in Hong Kong to take charge of the new office. Our main clients are there and you have to be near them during the transition. Will that be a problem? No problem. No, no. Wait. It's Hong Kong. He'll obviously love the idea. Oh, cutie… -He fell asleep. -Yes. Jeez, Ceci. Hello, honey. Honey… listen, I've been thinking a lot about our future. And there's something I want to tell you that will change our lives forever. Wow, sounds great. Tell me. No, you know what? I'd rather tell you later when you get home, but you won't believe it. We have to celebrate, okay? Okay, yes, sure, we'll celebrate when I get home. But I'll be home… late. Oh, badger. That's okay, honey. I'll fix you a surprise you'll love. You and me together from here to China, honey. From here to China, honey. I love you! You have to take this kid home right now. I think so too. I think Ceci is going to tell me she wants to be a mother. She sounded pretty clear to me. I think this is a good time. Yes, you'll see, it's really cool. Here's the light switch, so you know where it is. And this is… What's that… baby? Alan, Ceci. Ceci, Alan. Whose baby is it? It's Alicia's, the waitress at the Cortés Lounge. Remember her? Where's his mom? I don't know. She left him with me for three days. What? Three? Yes. What? Why are you reacting like this? What? Are you allergic to babies as well as cats or what? What? Was this the cat? He's been here since yesterday and you didn't say? You said the worst thing that could happen to you was having a baby, so… I took him away so you wouldn't freak out. Of course I would have freaked out, just like I am now. But if you had told me first, instead of showing up with a kid out of the blue… I probably would have reacted differently. Alan, help me out here. Honey… What? Alan says you look beautiful when you're mad. It's not funny. Why… Why… did she leave him with you? Well… Why didn't you ask if it was okay with me for you to bring a kid home for three days, honey? -You just don't care about me. -What? No. Look, I think the baby is tired, so… I'll put him to sleep and then we can talk, okay? I'll be right back. Hey, I'm waiting for you, huh? Don't even think… Smells great. Is there any for me? -I'm still waiting for an explanation. -Right. -He's asleep. -Don't shush me. Don't shush me. Okay. What are you doing? -What? Giving him milk. -No. Cold? Are you crazy? Thanks. Okay, I'll explain. The thing is, his mom had an emergency and she had no one to help her. And why didn't you tell me? Because I thought you wouldn't be on board. And I couldn't say no to her. Look, don't worry. She'll pick him up today and we'll go back to normal. Okay? -Today? -Yes, today. Nothing, bro, she didn't say a word. But she left something for you. Really? Hey, careful. -Here it is. -Let's see. Let's see. Look. Look, this is for you. Hey, Mike. -What if something happened to her? -No, she's done this before. She calls to say she has the flu and disappears for a week. Good night. -Bye, Iker. -Bye, take care. Alex, he's asleep. -Really? -Yes. -Great. -I have to go. -Get some rest. -You too. -Hey, I'd stay, but I have a date. -Sure. Listen, did you manage to get hold of the guy from the bar? Yes, he says Alicia hasn't been at work, and no one knows a thing about her. I've been calling her cellphone, but it goes straight to voicemail. So, you're telling me, that among all the selfless mothers in the world, and there's millions of them, lots of them, that fight for their kids, sacrifice everything for them, you chose to help the only one that abandons hers? Rafa, thanks, but that's the last thing I need to hear. -Have a good night. -You too. I left some soup in the kitchen, I ordered an ointment for his rash from the pharmacy, and Karime is lending us her diaper bag. And that's all I'll do to help you. Okay. I also sent you a link about how to bathe babies. By the way, the most important thing. My event in Valle is in a few days, and you promised you'd be there. Yes. Alan, honey pie, none of this is your fault. Good night, baby. -Honey. -Oh, what? Thank you. I promise I'll find Alicia and give her my baby. -What? -I mean, her baby. -Her baby. -Her baby, right. -Sleep tight. -Okay. Alan is wondering if you'd give us a goodnight kiss. -No, no kisses. -Come on. Good night, roommate. Come on. Let's have some fun. From what she told me, she's from San Luis Potosí. It seems her parents are very Catholic, so they made her have the kid. But she ran away from home because… besides being very Catholic… they're raging alcoholics. Ironic, isn't it? Coming all this way to serve drinks to other drunkards. No offense, man. Do you know anything about his dad? She never talked about it. Ugly story, very ugly. Bless you. Well, look. This is a copy of her ID. Who knows if it'll help you. It's fake, but it has an address. Well, good luck. Best of luck, pal. And if you hear from her, let me know. Tell me, Alan, do these streets seem familiar? Good morning. Is this the place? Do you live here? Hello, ma'am. Yes, what is it? Does Alicia live here? No, I don't know her. No! Ma'am. Ma'am, please. Ma'am! Come on in. Come on. Yes, this is it. Find a seat. Thanks. Good morning. I came to give the baby back to Alicia. Well, as I told you, I don't know her. She's playing dumb. Well, I do know her. She rents a room here, and sometimes I take care of the kid. But please don't leave him with me. I already have a lot of kids. Oh, really? And where are they? At school? No, they're working. I have to stay here, or else my mom could wander off. Okay, so whenever you see Alicia or talk to her, tell her this baby is her responsibility. She can't just leave him with a stranger. She can't mess with a stranger's life like that. Here. Take him. Oh, no. It's just that… some thugs around here wanted to take her kid away. I think that's why she left him with you. You know, they sometimes lease them to have them beg for money on the streets. But we'll figure it out. He finally fell asleep. So? I was very clear with the lady who rents her the room. I told her there's no way we can keep the baby any longer. So why is the kid still here? Some child exploiters want to take him. Someone has to protect him. Child exploiters? Yes, he deserves a family that loves him and takes care of him. -Right? -Yes. Of course he does. We should hand him over to social services so he gets adopted. Social services? I mean, that's all I can think of. They have social workers that could take care of him. Neither you nor I are ready to take care of a baby. I am. What? I think we should wait a couple of weeks in case Alicia comes back. -No. -We'll take care of him in the meantime. No. We have to… What you have to do is call the police and let them know there's a missing girl and an abandoned child. And please do it before my big event in Valle. Honey, do you understand how important this is to me? I'll be the first woman to have a position like this at the firm. And then there's the move to Hong Kong, getting packed up, finding an apartment. Hong Kong? For real? They offered to put me in charge of the office there. And when did you share this with me? For the record, I asked you before I told them I was in. You said it, "Together from here to China." And you took it literally. Hong Kong, really? Honey, Hong Kong… is my dream. Look… we can look after the kid for a few days until you tell the police. But after that, our lives have to go back to normal, don't you agree? Can you promise me you'll solve this like an adult? So, if my wife asks me why I'm here, should I say I'm working as a spy? Private investigator. -Rafa. -What? Do you think the disguises are really necessary? Do you think I'm improvising, bro? Everything's under control. Chill. Just chill. Look, you know what? Say whatever you want, but promise me you won't budge. Call me as soon as you see Alicia, okay? Rafa. I don't think this guy should look like a dealer. He'll get us in trouble. Say something. Come on, let's go. Hey, don't you want to read? Well, all right. Okay, enough. We won't read. No books for now. Let's have some fun. We'll have some fun, yes. Let's have some fun. -Good job. -Let's go. What? -It means "Hell yeah!" in Chinese. -Shut up! -It does not. -Okay, it means "eggs." No, Alan. Will you look at that? You're a mess. Okay, come here. Look at your hands. Oh no, not my face. Jackie, can you ask the client if they're okay with the references? We'd have a head start for today's meeting. I'll send you the client's number. -What's wrong with you? -Sorry! Alan, are you okay? Forgive me. I'm sorry, I'm an idiot. We need a car seat for you. All clear. She's gone. Her meeting's on the other side of town, so she won't be back until late. -We are free of Mussolini, cutie. -Wow. -Take a stroll with Aunt Jackie. -You're a free baby. Let's go for a stroll. Hello. What's up, Charlie? Are you coming for dominoes? It's Friday already? -Yes. -I didn't even notice. I don't think so. I don't have a babysitter. You still have him? Yes. Bring him to our place. We have a babysitter tonight. But then we'd be heading home late, and if it's cold, he might get sick, and I'd feel guilty. Excuse me, am I speaking with Alejandro Álvarez? Stop it, bro. Wait. I have another call. -Hold on. Don't hang up. -I'll be right here. -Hello? -Alex? -Yes. -The baby's mom is back. -She's back? -She's here. -Great news! -Should I wait? -Yes, of course. I'm on my way. -See you in a bit. Bro, I might make it tonight. -Great, we'll be here. -Call you later. -Cool, bye. -Bye. Is that bread yummy? Is it very yummy? It's yummy, huh? Hello? -Honey, guess what? -What? -Alicia is back. -Really? I'm on my way to give her the baby. Everything will go back to normal. Thanks, honey, I knew you'd sort it out. How are you? Good. Good, honey. Yes, now we can focus on your plans. Our plans, badger, ours. Right, our plans. -Yes. -I love you! -I love you. -See you later, bye! Are you absolutely sure she's in there? She'd just gone in when I called you. She hasn't come out. Thanks. -Thanks, spy. Good job. -Good luck with it. Yes. Come on. We're giving you back. We're home now. Alicia. Where were you? Hi, ma'am. Good afternoon. I'll leave you to it. I'll go check on my mom. Baby, forgive me. I love you a lot. Look, Alicia… I don't know where you were, but you can't disappear like that. You can't forget you have an Alan-shaped responsibility. -I mean, you're his mom-- -I was having cancer treatment. -What? -Cancer treatment. I have a tumor in my brain. The doctor says there's not much more they can do. What? Are you sure? Did they do blood work, tests, all that stuff? Yes, they did plenty of tests. I don't know what to say. I mean… What do you need? How can I help? Adopt him. Me? No. What? No. No, wait… Alicia, you don't even know me that well. I do, I've seen you plenty of times at the restaurant. You're always nice to everyone and you treat people with kindness. And since you met Alan, you've been really good to him. When you said you wanted a kid, I thought it was a sign from heaven. As soon as I got out of the hospital, I looked into how to do it. You just have to sign a couple of papers, and that's it. -I mean… -Please, don't say no. You're the best thing that could happen to Alan. Alicia, I really love Alan, I'm very fond of him, but… I mean, I have a wife, I can't make this choice on my own. Plus, this adoption thing is complicated. No, look. I left San Luis without registering the baby, so we can go and register him, and just say he's yours. I don't know. You're asking a lot of me. Yes. Yes, you're right. I don't know why I thought my son could have a better life than me. No, wait, that's not what I meant. Look. This is what we'll do. I'll take you to another doctor, a cancer specialist. He'll give us a second opinion. Okay? Surely, he'll find a solution. Don't worry, I won't leave you two alone. You'll be okay and so will your baby, okay? The only thing is… right now you have to take care of Alan. You are his mother. He wants to be with you. He missed you. All right? Call me if you need anything. Are you okay? Yes. Thanks a lot, okay? Okay. Are you sure you're okay? Okay. Good. I'm here if you need me. Call if you need anything at all. Okay. His bottle. I'll get it. Ma'am! Ma'am! Alicia passed out! Ma'am! Alicia. Poor girl, this happens all the time. -What do you mean? -She'll be fine in a bit. -Alicia? -I'll go get alcohol. Yes, quickly. A suit? I don't think I've ever seen him in a suit, apart from your wedding. Of course not. He hates them. But just look at this beauty he's going to wear in Valle. He'll look so handsome. -You seem pretty happy. -Yes. What happened with the kid? Problem solved. The mother turned up, finally. I started looking at apartments in Hong Kong today. -They're incredible. Want to see? -Of course. Show me. -Nice. -Look at the view. Look at this one. It's half a block away from the most important comic book store in Asia. -Alex will be thrilled. -That's cool. Alicia, I'm serious. You're not alone. We have an extra room here where you two could live. What? I couldn't. Don't worry. You and your baby will have everything you need, okay? Cecilia will have to understand. I'll be right back. No. Honey, please, listen. -Listen to what? -Well… You just invited two people to live in my house. Again, not even asking me, as if they were your family and I wasn't. Well, for family, you're not very understanding. I get that your intentions are good, but this is not how things are done. What's with "Cecilia will have to understand?" Well, yes… We can help them. How long are you going to keep playing the hero? Or are you planning on bringing them to Hong Kong? When did you ask if I wanted to go to Hong Kong? -I asked you. -No, you assumed. -No. -Yes. -No. -What am I going to do in Hong Kong? -Be your prince consort or what? -I thought you'd like it. You only think about your dreams, about what you want, your job. -No-- -It's all about what you want. What about me? What about my dreams, what I want? You should think about me. You should think about us. You should give me a child. I should give you a child? I'm only worth something as a woman if I give you a child? Why did we get married? Why are we together? If we're not going to have a baby… this makes no sense. Your suit. Obviously, you not going to forgive him, are you? -I don't know. -Come on, talk to him. Talk, but not when you're angry. You were both angry before. -With a calm mind. -What would they say? He told her what he thinks. -No… -He sees her as a baby machine. Of course he doesn't see her that way. You've been together seven years. He's not like that. He's kind of macho. -Yes, he's a bit of a macho. -No. We say stupid things when we're angry. Those stupid things come from somewhere, Karime. It didn't come out of nowhere. He really thinks that. So, you really think I'm the croissant's wife? No, don't start this again. Are you the croissant's wife or not? -So you do think that? -Okay, sorry. But some people do see you like that, as someone's wife or mother. -That's how it is. -Honestly… Let him explain, girl. Hear him out. Hear him out. No one ever died from listening to someone. Yes, okay. And let him explain what, ma'am? All men are the same. The kid is probably his. -No, Pili. No way. -No way. -No. -Listen, ma'am, it happened to me. This is like a Band-Aid. You have to rip it off! Pili, don't! -No! What did you do? -No! No! -Pili, oh my god! -Ma'am! Ma'am, you can buy yourself a new cell any day. Feel empowered, be independent. You own your destiny. -You don't need a man in your life, ma'am. -Pili, rice. Put it in rice, please. What's happening? -Why? -I'm sorry, I didn't see it coming. I'm sorry. If the rice doesn't work, I'll buy you a new one. Hey, you missed what Pili said. Fucking guru! You own your life. Who cares about the phone! Leave your message after the tone. Ceci, this is the 39th message that I've left you. You know what? Now I think about it, I should be the one who's offended. Because you're getting rid of me too easily. You're treating me as if I was a criminal. I already apologized. I love you. Call me. Look, I don't know much about these things, but it seems to me when you're a dad, you have to sacrifice many things. Maybe you have to sacrifice Ceci for the kid. I don't understand her attitude. I really don't. If you came to me with a kid, I swear my reaction would be way worse. Because it's simply not for me. And maybe it isn't for Ceci either. She hasn't let me explain anything. Look, you need to do something else, like… Have you thought about getting in touch with your mom after all this time? Think about it. I'm coming! Hello. Hi. Can we come in? -Yes, of course. Come on in, please. -Thanks. -Come in. -Thanks. Yes. Who's this baby? Is he my grandkid? What's your name, dear? His name is Alan. And no, he's not your grandkid. But he could be. What? It's a long story. Do you have time for me or do you have something better to do? Want some coffee? Look, Mom, you might not understand because you were never a very present or attached mother, and… Well, I suppose you'll take Ceci's side. Look, listen. I know you felt like I didn't care or even that I'd abandoned you. I'm sorry. Well, I felt that way because that's how it was. My only childhood memory is you with a suitcase in your hand. I was a flight attendant. I had to be wherever my job needed me. And never where I needed you. You didn't even make it to my wedding. Son, I raised you on my own. I did the best I could. You never wanted for anything. I wanted you. Look, I don't know what will happen with Ceci, but I'm your mom. I want to be there for you this time. Let me help you. They have to kiss, like they aren't really actors-- Well, how do you feel? What are you thinking? Did it help to sleep on it? What options have you considered? Karime, you are super awkward. You're the awkward one here. Well… I've made a decision. I'm can't be with a man who thinks I'm selfish. -Yeah. Yes. -Yes. And who's always asking me to work less. -Exactly. -Exactly! Who thinks my worth as a woman depends on me being a mom. -Right, girl! -Right. -Fuck him. -I'm with you. -I'm the architect of my own destiny. -Right, who needs him? -No one! -Wait, let's see. -The hell with him! -Fuck him! You are the architect of your own destiny. -But I also believe that you-- -What now, Karime? She's made her choice. She's happy. Please, tell us what you think. Yes, what do you think? I don't think anything. I have no opinion, okay? I have no opinion, no beliefs. I don't even have thoughts. I have no brain. My baby ate it. What? What did you say? My baby ate it. You're so silly. I'll be right back. Okay now. Enough. Ceci. I'm glad to see you here. -What is it, Guillermo? -Hey… Yes. I checked out your project. It's good. It's very well done. -Thank you. -Congratulations. Thanks. Hey, and… Well, you do know that if you let me help you a bit, you'd do much better, right? I could introduce you to my suppliers. And I can make the final figure work. No, thank you, but I'm not interested. -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm okay. You seem a little stressed. A piece of advice. Don't let your personal life interfere with your job. Especially if you're… A woman. If you're a candidate to become a partner, my dear. If the other partners notice this, they might have second thoughts. -Just a tip. -Thanks. Asshole. Hi, you finally decided to call me back. Alejandro. I'm just calling to tell you I'll drop by tomorrow at 12:00 to pick up my stuff. Please don't be there. I don't want to see you. Don't make this harder for me. But… See what you make of this. The adoption process takes a long time. I have an extra room in my apartment. It seems you'll be selling your apartment. So, you could come live with me. We'll help Alex take care of the baby, and I'll take care of you. -Really? -Thanks, Mom. Of course, I'm happy to help. Thanks. Did you know disposable diapers produce 900,000 tons of trash a year? I think you should consider using cloth diapers, Alan. Stop. What's wrong with you? Leave him alone. He's just a baby. Poor thing. He's learning. Babies can understand things. Yeah, I know, but, well… He's the future. What's going on here? What is this doing in my office? I want an explanation right now. It's just a baby. Alejandro, you really seem to want to get fired. You missed the pitch for your own campaign, you skipped work yesterday and the day before. Not only am I cutting your bonus but I'm also-- I sent you an email explaining I had family issues to resolve. Didn't you get it? This is an office. Family problems don't get solved here. Look, I had to take care of this baby. He's in a very complicated situation. But I've delivered all my work. I mean, Rafa has been covering for me at the meetings. I've been there via Skype. I've been working from home. Sylvia, please. You should be more tolerant. Tolerant? I'll have to ask you to go. Does anyone else have anything to say? -Sylvia-- -No, look, don't say anything. Let's go, come on. Your things? Sylvia. If someone had loved you before you were six, you'd be a better person. Let's go. -Go on, get in your box. -Back to work! And to think we were all babies once. Then who knows what happens that we become complicated and hurt each other. It's so hard for us to patch things up. I owe this baby so much. What's up? What do you want? Sylvia, I'm here to apologize. Take a seat. Thanks. Listen, Sylvia… I want to apologize for what I said. Sometimes, when I get angry, I say things I don't mean. I'm sorry. Is that it? Yes. Okay. I do know everything you guys say behind my back. Sylvia… Since I don't work here anymore, I'd like to say, I don't know, try to be a little less harsh. Yeah, more flexible. We all have a personal life. And usually we're motivated to work for a particular reason. What motivates us is family. You must have something that motivates you, right? Yes, Yecapixtla. Well, yes. They say dogs are like family, right? I'm sure Yecapixtla values everything you do for her, and she's deeply grateful to you-- One… Whether I was loved or not as a child, that's not your problem. -Sylvia, I know. Forgive me-- -Two… Whether I'm strict, harsh, or whatever the hell I want to be, that's also not your problem. Okay, yes. Three… Your work is impeccable. I'll consider giving you your job back because you're being upfront with me. Okay. Yes. Life isn't easy, Alex. You don't always have the life you want but the life you're given. Well, I don't agree. You can choose the life you want because you make choices, and we all go through stuff, but in the end, what matters is what you do about it, right? Is Rafa coming? -What, didn't he tell you? -What? He's on a third date with a woman from Tinder. A third date? -Yes. -Another 20-year-old? No, this one is 43 and has a kid. Great. I thought he'd never grow up. Hey, some of us take more time, but we do change. Though it would be more fun if you didn't lose people in the process. Cecilia is a great girl, okay? -She loves you a lot. -You think so? After everything I said? You messed up, but I think you can fix it. If you can show her she doesn't have to give up her life for you to be a dad… I mean, it's hard. And you'll need a huge support system, but you can at least count on us. Of course. Thanks. But I don't know. Still, I'd love to be there at her work event. -When is that? -Today. -What? Her event? -What the hell are you doing here? She's being made partner. Why are you here? I'm just respecting her decision to never see me again. Please! How many times have I told you I never want to see you again when I'm mad? Twice… a week! Exactly. Hey! Is she the love of your life or not? -Yes. -Then don't give up. -The suit! -Okay. -Can you watch Alan? -Of course. You've got this. Siri, call Ceci. Here's what I found about Salt Lake City. No, call Ceci! Siri, call Ceci! -The number for CiCi water park, Acapulco… -You're useless! Are you nervous? Yes. No. Well, a little. -You're prepared for this. -You're the fucking boss. I'm forgetting it! Relax. I feel like I'm missing something. Earrings, you need earrings. No… It's not just the earrings. Thanks, buddy. The keys, sir. Oh, sorry. Today is my day. I won't let anyone mess it up. Exactly. -Not Guillermo, not Alejandro, no one. -Yes, girl! Don't think about Alejandro. He screwed up. He didn't screw up that bad. I'm sure he'd love to be here-- -Kari, bad timing. -He deserved to be heard. The last thing she needs is to hear about Alejandro. You brought him up. Hey! Why don't you go save your seats? In case they get taken. -Right? -It's assigned seating. -Kari, let's go. -They told me when I came in. -They said, "If you're a friend of…" -Yes, I know. Okay. Today's my day. Sorry. Hello. Excuse me, Cecilia Méndez's room? -I can't give out guest information. -Please, it's urgent. Really, you have no idea… Mila, Karime! Mila! Where's Ceci? Where is she? -Really? -Dude… Room 206. Okay. Thanks. It's like a Julia Roberts movie. Hi. -No. -Honey. -No. -Honey, please. Give me one minute. One minute. After that, if you want, I'll leave. Please. One minute. Okay. Forgive me for all the stupid things I said. I married you because I love you. Because I want to spend my whole life with you. With or without kids? With or without kids. But, please, let me explain. I didn't plan all this. Alicia, Alan's mom… has a very advanced cancer. She has no one to take care of her or the baby. I couldn't hand the baby over to social services or an orphanage. Sometimes, they turn 18 and no one ever adopted them. When I went to give Alan back… -Alicia fainted. -What? Right in front of me. I didn't know what to do. That's why I brought them home. I couldn't just leave them there. Why didn't you tell me all of this? I don't know. I didn't know how. I… I'm sorry. You know I want to be a dad. And life is giving me this opportunity. I don't want to force you into anything, or clip your wings, but… Look. What if I'm a dad without forcing you to be a mom? Would you stay with me? But how? Well… I'd work from home. I'd take care of Alan completely. Of course, on your terms. Just let me be a dad. Honey, I never said you couldn't be. I just asked you to wait. Alex, I love you. I want you to fulfill your dreams, but… What about everything else? What about Hong Kong? -What about-- -Hong Kong. I'll wait for you, for as long as you need. Look, if you want, we can sort this out later. Right now, your event is what matters. -Okay? -Yes. Can I stay? I want to see you shine. I want to clap for you. I'm very proud of you. I put the sharp fancy suit on. -I love you. -I love you. You look so handsome. You look stunning. -Come on. -Shall we? Let's go, yes. Go on, hurry. -Mario, perfect. Take care of this. -Thanks. Mr. Gonzalo. -Alejandro, nice to see you. -You too. -Ready, Ceci? -You bet I am. All right, come on. So… Hello? What is it, Mom? No, I didn't pick up because I was driving and had no signal. What? Okay, I'll call you back. -Honey. -What happened? Alicia's just been taken to the hospital. I don't know what will happen, but I have to sign some documents. -Or else, they'll take Alan. -No, go. -What? -Go. -No, but-- -You have to go. -I don't want to let you down. -Honey, wait… I'll fix this. Mr. Gonzalo. My husband and I have a family emergency. Can I please be the first to do my presentation so I can go with him? Please. Of course, Ceci, you've got it. Let me tell Mario. -Mario… -Sorry, Ceci… The first domestic issue that comes up, and you're jumping ship? -Don't do this to us. -Didn't you hear? Cecilia has a family emergency, and anyone responsible and committed to their family is there when needed. Thank you. This is like her final exam for the rest of the partners. This is important for her too, Gonzalo. No, Guillermo, this is merely a formality so everyone feels included. The paperwork for Cecilia to take my place has already been done. All we need is for her to sign the deed of incorporation. -What? -Mario! -What does that mean? -She's the boss. Yes? What? Did you know? You go first. Yes, of course. -Take this. -Yes. Excellent. Mr. Gonzalo, thank you, thank you for everything. Here, keep it. -No. -Yes. Go on, solve whatever it is you have to solve. Go on. -Thank you. Thanks a lot. -Perfect. Congratulations, honey. -Let's go. -Let's go. -No. -What? -Honey, give me a second. -Okay. -Wait for me. -Yes. Guillermo. Is your résumé up to date? -Always. -Great. Because, as the new partner, I will not allow a corrupt, misogynistic, creep like you to work in my company. So, you can start sending your résumé to other companies. Mr. Gonzalo, thanks for everything. Go on. Resolve your issue. See how you give a woman a bit of power and she goes crazy? What's wrong with her? What are you going to do? You can't let her do this. Gonzalo, you're not thinking with your head, man. No, Guillermo. I'm not the boss anymore. Although you see me here, in a suit, I'm actually already in the Bahamas drinking margaritas with my wife, in my swim shorts, sunbathing. It's wonderful! Excuse me. A toast to Cecilia. Are you still here? -Yes. -Yes, of course. -We're still here. -We're here. Want anything? I'm going downstairs to see how Alan and my mom are doing. -Some water. -Okay. -You, honey? -No. -No? -Well, bring me some coffee. Okay. -Thanks, honey. -Yes. Hey, I didn't tell you before… but I'll take good care of Alan. I'll play with him a lot and I'll love him a lot, while you get better. Thank you so much. Thank you. Tell him I love him, okay? I'll tell him every day. And so will you. LOVING MOTHER Can you believe Sylvia set up a breastfeeding room in the office? -No. -Yes! She also got sad when I said I was leaving the agency. -Why? What did you say? -I told her the truth. That I'm going back to animation, but working from home, so I can take care of my baby. Well, I also said I'd send her a postcard and some dumplings from Hong Kong. -Honey. -Yes? Please don't joke about that. I mean it. I just can't stand thinking about being apart for so long. Don't joke about it. If you'll have us, we'll come with you. Alex, stop it! Really, honey, it's not funny. I mean it. From here to China. What? -They say Hong Kong! -Yes, of course they do. -We're going to Hong Kong. -Yes! We're going to Hong Kong, Alan! -Alan, we're going to Hong Kong! -We're all going. -We're going to Hong Kong! -Yes, we are. -I love you. -I love you too.
