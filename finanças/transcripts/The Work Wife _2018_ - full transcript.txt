Whoa, hold up, hold up. What do you mean? We're ten feet from the house, you can't make it? I don't know if this is normal, but I'm sweating in my ears. Is that, is that right? Hmm, I stink. I don't care because I love you. I love you too. Right. You don't sweat? Huh? You look as beautiful as you did when you left this morning. Ah, you're just sayin' that 'cause you love me. -That's not true. -Hm. Well, anyway, I am proud of you. You kept up with me this time. That's a first. Yeah, I had a little motivation. No. -What? -No! No, you have a good day ahead of you, you gotta get ready for work. I'll chase you if I have to. -Come here. -Oh, God. Don't even think about it. How did you see me? The reflection in the window, genius. Okay, got it. What's this? So, I was gonna pick something up on the way to work. Well, you never know, you might not have a chance to get away. Regardless, you now have this brilliant culinary masterpiece to look forward to. Hashtag, wifeskills. Hm, well, thank you. So, how you feelin'? I'm, uh... I'm-I'm fine. Why? You're not nervous, are you? No. Not at all. Yes, I am, a little. Well, you are a senior copywriter at Pepper & Muir. You've been talking about this agency for years. You are one of the best in the business and it is about time that one of these big agencies hire someone like you. Lisa, it's not that big of a deal. No, I get it, it is a big deal. You haven't worked in a few months, money's tight. I know, I pay the bills. Hey. I'm sorry. But, yeah, I am a little tense, okay? Well... you wouldn't be human if you weren't a little nervous. It's okay. Yep, I-I know what it is. I hate first days. Just wish we could fast-forward a few weeks. Yeah, well, I'm not concerned. I know you're going to crush it. All right. Oh, I forgot to tell you. I got another graphic design client yesterday. -Oh. -Word is spreading. So, I think I'm gonna go at it full time. Okay, I mean, are you ready for something like that? Yeah. Yeah, I've been feeling a lot better lately. Anyway, we both need to work. Not just you. All right. -Jacket. -Jacket. Okay. -Okay, I gotta go. -I love you. Love you too. -Knock 'em dead. -Call you soon. You're early, Mr. Miller. Oh, hi, yeah, it's, uh, first day, and if you're not on time, you're late in my book. Well, that's a great attitude. Miss Williams will certainly appreciate that. -Good. -Can I get you some coffee? No, actually, I'm, I'm fine, thank you. Okay, well, let me show you to your office. Um, I'm sorry, wait, office? I... I normally just get a little cubicle. No, Miss Williams likes all of her copywriters to have their own spaces to keep those creative juices flowing. Well... Follow me. -Restroom this way? -Yes. -Thanks. -Sean. -Good morning. -Oh, Miss Williams. Good to see you again. Katie, my senior employees and I are all on first name basis. -Got it? -Got it. Katie. So, how'd you like your office? Uh, it is amazing. So, thank you again for the opportunity. I look forward to working with you and your team. And I'm looking forward to finally having your creative brilliance here. -Rather than with other guys. -Spencer & Williams, yes. Mm, no. Don't say those names here. -They're the enemy. -Oh, I'm not gonna say it again. Never. So, have you heard of Harper's Gin Tonic? Yeah, they're the, uh, the cocktail mix company, right? Yes, they're trying to branch out into other avenues right now, and we're on the verge of landing the contract for all of their products. This could be huge for our agency. Why don't you get comfortable and meet me in my office in 30. You got it, Katie. Yes. So, I looked over some of the Harper's Gin Tonic info. Uh, how can I be of assistance? I actually want you to meet someone. Hey, I've actually been looking for you. Lena said you wanted to see me. Yes, Sean, this is Jen Anderson. She's one of our junior copywriters. Jen's gonna be bringing you up to speed on the account and assisting you. Jen, this is Sean Miller, our new senior copywriter. Oh, I didn't know you were hiring from the outside. Well, I wouldn't really say he's from the outside. Sean used to work for one of our competitors. You can say he's kind of from in the inside, if you know what I mean. So, if you wouldn't mind bringing him up to speed on the Gin Tonic account, so he's ready for the 3 p.m. pitch meeting? Absolutely. I'll give you the tour. Yeah, thank you. Pleasure meeting you. Pleasure's all mine. And, Katie, we'll see you in the conference room later. So, Katie said something about a pitch. Wow, straight to business, I see. -Well, sorry. -No apologies. I like a man who gets right to it. This is Ray's office. He's the other senior copywriter. Kind of a jerk. Very uptight. He looks down on us juniors, which is not a good idea considering it's our job to take care of the senior copywriters, like you. Anyway, meet me in my cubicle in 15 to talk drinks. I'm talking about Gin Tonic, silly, not happy hour. Oh, and I'm yours, so, do as you please. Okay, you've been a copywriter for way too long if you think everything's a double entendre. No, I, no, I was... Ne-never mind. No, literally, it's my job to take care of you, so, whatever you need, I have your back. It's almost like we're married. For better or for worse. Till death do us apart. I'm married, I'm married. Mr. Harper, we're very excited to brainstorm ideas with you. Ray, would you mind presenting your ideas first? Uh, yes, uh, well, o-okay so, imagine, if you will, an overworked manager in a small, yet, uh, busy office in the Midwest. No. We want to get away from the corporate image. Oh, uh, right, okay, then, uh... All right, we're in a college dorm-- No, our products are high-end. College students can't afford them. Yes, of course. Okay, how about... if we-- Mr. Harper, this is Sean Miller another of our senior copywriters. Go ahead, Sean, tell Mr. Harper your brilliant ideas. My ideas? Yes, the ones we discussed earlier? They were brilliant. Oh, those, uh, yes, those ideas, um... Sure, excuse me. Well, Sir, the, uh, the entire team and I were, we were brainstorming earlier this morning and we realized that... Well, when creating an event or a party, the Harper's Gin Tonic traditionally is not the leading brand. It's more like a supporting cast member. We're proposing that the Harper's Gin Tonic be the star. You see, we at P&M believe that if we can create a campaign where Harper's Gin Tonic is the, the life of the party, the leading liquor at an event. It's the-it's the first item that you purchase before you buy any other drink. We can do one of two things. Number one, we could change the public's perception of your brand, and, number two, we think we can triple your sales by simply stating that Harper's Gin Tonic is-is the star... Sir. If you'd like, Sean and I can create a presentation and have it ready for you in just a couple of days. You're definitely onto something there, Mr. Miller. I'll give you 48 hours. Thank you, Sir, we really appreciate it. Nice save there, Miller. Thank you, Sir. Very impressive, Sean. Thank you, Jen. Way to think on your feet. Yeah. I guess we have some work to do. -Two days. -My God! -Great job. -Thanks, I'll catch up with you. Yeah. Well, hello there, Mr. Senior Copywriter. Well, hello there, beautiful. Rough first day? I mean, uh, I mean... No, not really, just a little intense. What happened? Well, I completely faked my way through an entire presentation. Well, that's right up your alley. Ha-ha, very funny. So now, I gotta get to my office and figure out what this product is and then, uh, Jen's coming by and we're gonna create a campaign. Jen? Who's that? Uh, she's my junior copywriter. You got a junior copywriter, huh? Yeah, the boss, Katie, she puts together junior and senior copywriters and, you know, it's kinda like her job to support whatever I do. I thought that was my job. -Ha-ha, very funny. Hold on. -[Jen] I'm sorry. Let's go to lunch. No, my wife, she packed me something. No, no, no, we're goin' out. -Sorry, sweetie. -What's goin' on? No, Jen just wanted to take me to lunch. You mean you're not gonna eat my gourmet cooking? Well, there's a, uh... There's a nice restaurant across the street that serves a mean pastrami sandwich and it's kind of my favorite. All right, well, at least you'll have that sandwich in case, you know, you have to stay late. I'll meet you downstairs. And call me if you do, so I can hear your voice. You know I will. I love you. I love you too. -Buh-bye. -Bye. So, um, how long have you been married? -Five years. -Aw! You're newlyweds. Well, if you consider being married five years newlyweds, yeah, I guess, it's... Seems like forever. Five years isn't that long. Eh, well, okay. Well, do you have any kids? No. No kids. I mean, not yet. But, um... What? No, it's nothing. Sean, you can tell me. I'm here for you. My wife just had her second miscarriage a few months ago, so it's been really, really rough on her. And on top of that, I haven't worked in three months. So, yeah, it's, uh... certainly has not been easy. Well, you're in love, right? And with love, you can conquer anything. Yeah, right. Okay, so... What about you? Married? Kids? Uh, no. Um, I don't even have a boyfriend, actually. Come on. I'm just, I guess, really focused on work and... Honestly, I don't think I'm marriage material. I doubt that, I think you just haven't found the right guy. Well, I thought I had, but, um... he died. Oh, I'm, I'm so sorry. I don't know, things were going really well and he started slipping at work, and... he got fired. And, um... he couldn't handle it, and, um... he killed himself. I'm really sorry, that's, um... That's terrible. Anyway, that took me a long time to get over. I'm just... now finally able to... you know, think about other men in that way. He worked at P&M, actually. What? Yeah, he was a senior copywriter. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Oh. -Sorry. No, no, that's okay, that's okay. I'm-I'm sorry for you, but, um, just-just so you know, get what you want, this one, the first one's on me. Thank you. You're welcome. Honey, I'm home. I'm upstairs, takin' a bath. Hey. Hello. Hey. Well, good, glad to know you actually care about me. Mm, what's that supposed to mean? It means you didn't call. It's been several hours. You said you'd call. Honey, I'm sorry. Jen and I got slammed on this presentation for the new Harper's Gin Tonic account Oh, okay. Um, listen, Jen told me that they hire outside graphic designers and she thought it'd be a good idea if you jumped on board to help us with the presentation. -Really? -Mm-hm. That's... really nice of her. Hm, yep. Where you goin'? Uh, sweetie, I-I have a lot of work to do. Well... I'm happy to see you back in the saddle. I missed this Sean Miller. Yeah. I missed this Sean Miller too. What are you thinking? What am I thinking? Um, I am thinking that we use all the Gin Tonic products and we make them characters in the story. I love it. It's like we're casting a movie. Exactly. Hey, by chance, do you have any other comps for the other products I can post? Yeah. Ray and I were playing around with those last week. They should still be on his desk. Sorry, do you mind grabbing them while I jump on this call, they should be in a folder labelled "Gin Tonic." -Got it. -Hey. Uh, do you think he'll mind? Ray? Pfft! No, not at all. He'll probably be happy he doesn't have to do the work. What? No. Yeah. Okay. Bye. And finally, all the insuring casts will pretty much say the same thing. They'll now have continuity with all the marketing materials. Thank you. Good job. Mm, we'll see. I love it. You do? Yes, I think you have the exact vision I'm looking for. It's brilliant. Thank you. Where did you find this guy? Good job. Let's move forward with Miller's idea. The job is yours. Great, I'll have Business Affairs put together a contract and we'll start work on the new mockups based on this consent. Congrats, Jen, Sean. Unbelievable. That was my concept. I'm sorry, what? Y-you steal some of my concepts... ...without giving me any credit. Ray, hold on a minute, what are you talking about? We worked on them together, Ray. I didn't realize they were your concepts. I... Lena... Lena told me... that you were in my office. Of course she did. Yeah, I went into your office to get a file that Jen left. You mean, my concepts? Ray, I... I said I'm sorry. You know, I-I, ugh... I don't believe either one of you. Give me a break, Ray. You're just jealous because Sean nabbed a client on his first pitch and you haven't brought in a new client for months. Oh, go ahead. Do something outrageous. Find out how long you keep your job. You better watch your back, Miller. 'Cause this place... it isn't what you think it is. Oh, he's so dramatic. Jen, were-were some of those his ideas? Some were his, some were mine. Oh, come on, Jen. He works for the company. There's no "I" in team, right? Isn't that what you boys always say? Aren't we working together? Look, he's just bitter because his ideas got shot down. It's fine. Nice job, you guys. We've got to celebrate tonight. A little office party on me at the City Cafe. D-d-do you mind if I invite my wife? I'm sure she would like to, uh, meet everyone. Of course, we'd, we'd love to meet her. -Great. -Yeah, right. Yeah, I mean, you know what they say, "Behind every great man is a great woman." Well, I should probably go call my wife right now. Right? Good work. Thank you. To the perfect team! Hey! Yes! Oh, hey, guys. Sorry I'm late. You look beautiful. Thanks, sweetie. You must be Lisa! It's so nice to meet you. Sean's told me so much about you. It's nice to meet you too. -Honey, do you want a drink? -Yes, I'd love one. -So, Sean-- -It's so much... Oh. You go first. Well, I was just gonna say that Sean's already a superstar around here. -Really? -Mm-hm. Have you told her the good news? Uh, no, because I was gonna do it when I saw her in person. So, we are here because Mr. Harper approved our Gin Tonic concept. Uh, your Gin Tonic concepts. Ours. We're a team, right? That is so awesome! Congratulations, I'm so happy for you. For all of you. So, Lisa, uh, Sean tells me that you own your own graphic design business. Oh, yeah, um, it's, you know, I'm just starting back up again. I'm trying to get a few more paying customers. [chuckles] So, what kinda things do you do? You know, ads, campaigns, et cetera. Right now, I'm working on an invitation for the grand opening of a beauty salon near my house. And it is amazing. Uh, have you ever done any corporate stuff? Yeah, yeah, in the past. Not recently. Well, I was thinking... that maybe you should take a stab at the Gin Tonic presentation. We're down a couple of graphic designers here at the office, so we could really use the help. I have the budget to hire someone freelance. You can get your feet wet. Okay, you know what, don't worry about it, guys, I really do have a lot on my plate. So, it's fine. You know what? I think Jen's right. I think you should take the graphics position. You sure about that? Yeah, yeah, I think you'd do an amazing job. -Oh, okay, wow. Yay. -Fantastic! So, once Sean gives me the direction we're heading, I'll give you a call and we'll get started. -All right. -Sean, come over here. And bring over that real wife of yours. I wanna meet her. Um, I'll see you in a minute. Have fun, girls. That's the boss. -Okay. -Oh. "Real wife," what's that? It's, it's like an office joke. Since Sean and I are so close I'm the work wife, you're the real wife. I mean, if it bothers you, I can tell 'em to stop. No, no, it's fine. -Okay. -Don't worry about it. -I'll be right back. -Mm-hm. Let's take a selfie. You mind? Okay, ready? One, two, three. One more. One, two, three. So, I'm here with world-famous graphic design artist, Lisa Miller. So, Lisa, tell me, what's the latest project you're working on. Well, my latest job is working for P&M's Gin Tonic team. And is that Gin Tonic you're drinking? It is, and I, I have to say... It's terrible! It tastes like cough syrup. It's like I need a chaser for my cocktail. What's that? That is awesome, I'm sending that to you right now because it's so funny. Oh, I love it, oh, my God. -So bad. -Oh, there's... There he is. Sean! Come on. You okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm-I'm fine. No, you're not. I know you too well already. Do you? You and Lisa are having problems, aren't you? It's just you and me. No one else here. Do you wanna use me as a sounding board and get some things off your chest? Tell me what's goin' on. I mean, I know about the miscarriages and... it's awful. But, I know there's something else. Yeah, but I don't understand why she doesn't see that. Yeah, well, sounds like she doesn't know what she has. I don't know, maybe it's because I was raised without a dad, that's why I... don't know if I could really be a good dad at all. You're gonna be a great dad. -You think so? -Yes. You're such a gregarious guy. I can totally see you, you know, playin' with your kids, teaching them, coaching baseball. Oh, no, it's... Uh, I gotta go. It's late. I... Can I, uh... Can I ask you something? Why are you treating me so nice? Because you're my boss. And, honestly... I have a slight crush on you. -Kinda married. -I know. And... it makes you even more attractive to me. It's like I see how good you are to your wife and... ...you're sexy. Well, who knows what would have happened if we'd have met ten years earlier. Yeah. Maybe things would've been different between us. Sean, I don't wanna be just your work wife. I wanna be your real wife. Please. I can't. It's late and I... I have to go. Good night, Jen. -Sean? -Hey, hon. I'm home. What are you still doing up? You're working on the Harper account? Yeah. Yeah, I wanted to do a good job for you. Where you been? Oh, I've just, uh, you know... Work... Just some work stuff. Why didn't you come home to work? Could've helped me with the presentation. Well, I figured Jen gave you all the information that you needed. So... Would have been nice if you at least called. Yeah, sorry. Well, I-I've gotta... I gotta hit the sack. All righty. I will see you bright and early in the morning. Okay, well, I'm gonna get to your office as early as possible, so I guess I won't wake you. Okay. All right. I'll see you in the morning. -Hey, Sean. -Hey. Her renderings are great. I-I'm sorry. Whose renderings? You didn't forget, did you? -What? -Your wife's. She's in the conference room setting up. Okay. Would you please stop saying that? Jen is not my work wife. I wasn't referring to Jen. Your real wife's here. Oh, no! Oh, I am such an idiot. Oh, well... Good morning, sunshine. I thought on time was late. Yeah, I'd, uh... I, I really couldn't sleep much after our conversation last night. I know. Neither could I. Stop. Stop. You, you can't do that, especially with my wife here. Sure. Sean. Yes. What? I was gonna save this for after we got the first payment on the Harper account, but I decided to give it to you now. For good luck. Open it. Jen, what's this all about? -It's engraved. -I-I, I know it's engraved. Why would you buy me something? Because you're so good to me. And I wanted to reciprocate with something meaningful. I'm glad you like it. Jen, listen, it's, it's, it's very thoughtful. Okay? Well, I'm sure you wanna get in there and see your wife, so I'll be in in a moment. Okay. -Hey. -Hey. -So, how is it? -It's great. It's ready. Good. Do you need me look over it anymore? -No. I've got it. -You sure? Perfect. Yeah. It's set. I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm just nervous. No, you're gonna be great. And if this is ready, it's gonna be perfect. -All right. -Have full faith in me. Okay. Oh, here they come. I gotta go. -Okay. Good luck. -Thank you. Lisa. Where're you going? Oh, um, I'm... I'm heading out. I-it's all set. All you'd have to do is push play. No, we need you, what if something goes wrong with the presentation? Here. Have a seat. Watch our man do his thing. Okay. Thank you all for coming and the opportunity to present our ideas to you. Sean, take it away. Okay. So, um, we open on an aerial shot of Hollywood. And then, we cut to various shots of the glitz and glamour of old Hollywood. Now, as we push in to the movie theatre, the curtain opens, and there is your entire Harper's Gin Tonic line on stage. We have instantly created your product as a star instead of a co-star. And we've also allowed the consumer to connect with the product line and the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. Now, this is the new Gin Tonic girl. She, uh... Well, she represents a lifestyle of... Well, a lifestyle of someone who drinks Harper's Gin Tonic products. It tastes like cough syrup. Seriously, I need a chaser for my cocktail. -What? -Who does that? -Do you want some? -What is the meaning of this? Come on... Mr. Harper, we apologize. Is this some kind of joke? I'm sorry. I don't, I don't know what happened. Is that you? I-I'm sorry. She's just a freelance designer. Clearly, the presentation's gone wrong. It certainly has. Crappy "cough syrup." Is this how you feel about Gin Tonic? No, sir. No, sir-- How am I supposed to continue with your agency if you can't even respect my product? I've had enough. I am sure, Spencer & Williams could use my business. Mr. Harper... Sean, I am so sorry. I have no idea what happened. I... I went through that presentation 20 times. Lisa, I trusted you. Do you not understand, this was a huge presentation for me. Do you know what's gonna happen if I lose my job? We cannot go three more months without income. -Jen, I'm sorry. -No. Really. It's my fault. I should have never put you in this position, especially because you don't have any corporate experience. No, no. I was prepared. I-I have no idea how that video got there. Sweetie, it's totally on me, okay? I should have hired a professional. Sean... We will talk when I get home. I'm so sorry, Sean. Don't worry about it. Have you spoken to Katie? Nope. I, uh... Well, I talked to Dr. Garcia today. Is that something we really wanna get into right now? No. You're right. I'm sorry. Are you gonna answer it? I-it could be work. Then I'm definitely not gonna answer it. Sean, what can I do to make this up to you? I just need some time, okay? Hey, sweetheart, I'm sorry. I need to apologize. What is this? What? Are you leaving me? Leaving you? No. Why? Look at these text messages. I am so disgusted by you right now! I can't believe you had the nerve to come back into our house! Lisa, I don't know why she sent this. These, these are lies, okay? Why would she lie, Sean? Looks like you're the liar. And a cheat! Come on. Stop. All right, stop, stop! No, don't. You should go stay with her. 'Cause I don't want you here! Lisa! Damn it! Sean. Sean. You bad boy. You didn't answer any of my texts. You look tense. Is that why you wanted to meet? Maybe we should blow off some steam. We could go dancing... or something. -What the hell is your problem? -What do you mean? You know exactly what I'm talking about. -No, I don't. -Yes, you do. You set Lisa up to fail. -No, I didn't. -It was your recording. A-and what's with all this nonsense with the texting, huh? You knew exactly what you were doing when you recorded that video. How would I know that? J-just don't play dumb, Jen. You don't play dumb, Sean. Come on. There's chemistry between us. And there's nothing between you and Lisa. I have a wife, okay? So? You don't have children. And you probably can't even have children with her, so what do you have really? -Huh? -What do I have? -Yeah. Yeah! -What do I have? -I have a commitment, Jen. -Oh. Like that ever meant anything to you. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I know why you left Spencer & Williams. You reneged on a deal. You had a contract, but you walked out. Your word means nothing, Sean. How do you know about that? 'Cause I did my research. Good for you. But see, the problem is that's business, not personal. Oh, it's not personal, huh? It's not personal? You've been flirting with me ever since the moment you walked in here! You know what? You're insane. You are insane! Be a professional, Jen. And leave my wife alone, okay? Fine. Sean. 'Cause all I want is for you to be happy! And you weren't happy with her! A front-running Flyers ripped the Sabres 14-3. Maybe even got past the Flames 7-6. Dan Quinn scored three times helping the Penguins pass the Jets 8-3... -Yeah. -Sean. I need you to come home now! Uh, you kinda kicked me out, honey. Our house caught on fire! -What? -Yeah. -Are you okay? -Sean, I need you. -Please come home. -I'm on my way right now. No. I'm on my way right now. Honey, I said I'll be right there. Okay, bye. So you're sure it only damaged the porch? -The house is okay? -Officer! -Excuse me, this is my house. -Sir. hold on. One moment. -Excuse me, Sir. Sir? -Hey, honey! -Honey. -Oh, Sean. -I'm so sorry. -I'm sorry, too. What? Believe me. This is my boss... -I'm sorry. Are you okay? -Yeah. Now that you're here. Really. This is my boss. I have to see if he's okay. -Did you call her? -No. No. I'm so sorry. I heard about the fire and I just got the creepiest feeling that it was your house. What happened? Are you guys okay? Jen, how did you hear about this? I heard it in the news. What news? There's no one here. Well, s-someone must have reported it because I heard it on the radio and they specifically said your street. And I just got worried. Well, we're, we're just fine. So, you can go home now. You don't have to be so rude. I came here to help you. Sure you did. Look, I don't know why you're here and what you're up to, but we don't need your help, all right? Officer? Can you please escort this woman off of our property? She doesn't need to be here. -Sean-- -No. Don't. -Don't touch me. -Ma'am, please leave. I have every right to be here. You can't just tell me to go away. -This is a public street... -Ma'am, let's, let's go. What is this? This woman is infatuated with you, Sean. You have to do something about this. I will. I will. Officer. Officers. I'll, uh... I'll take care of this. Can I have a moment, please? Jen, um, listen, this is... It's a very emotional time for us right now. And I really, really appreciate you showing up. I need some privacy. And you've got to respect that. Fine. I'll do it for you but not for her. I'd better go. That woman is seriously demented. I'm sorry, honey. I'll take care of it. Yeah. Let's go, let's go talk to the officers. Come on. Don't worry about that. Let's go. Come on. I don't know what's going on between you two, but I can't afford to have you acting like teenagers when I'm trying to run a business. If you can't figure out how to work together, then I'm gonna fire you and you. -I didn't do anything. -I don't wanna hear it. You're both responsible. I already have to get down on my hands and knees and try to beg for the Harper account back. I don't need the two of you making my life any more difficult. So bury your heads in your work and get the job done. -Got it? -Got it. Good. Now, get the hell out of here and help me get this campaign back. Sean. Sean, come on. Mr. Harper's waiting. Okay. Be right back. Lisa. Lisa. Hi. Listen. I've been meaning to call you over the past couple weeks but Sean and I have just been so busy on the Gin Tonic account... Anyway, I really just wanted to apologize to you for my behavior. -I'm sorry. -Hm. Well, I appreciate your apology. But it's a bit late. Just keep your work relationship with my husband strictly professional. You get it? Yes. Of course. I... I just wanted you to hear directly from me. Please, believe me. I didn't light your house on fire. -I promise-- -Please stop. It's done. Past. Right. So let's just move forward. Listen. I thought your relationship was on the rocks. But when I found out you were still together, you know, I, I told Sean that you should go for it. With the kids. I-I'm sorry, it's probably none of my business but he mentioned to me that you were having a really hard time starting a family. He... He talked to you about that? Yeah. I hope you don't mind. But it was really bothering him and... you know, he mentioned that you had a couple of miscarriages. But I told him, "Look. A lot of women go through this." -And it's not-- -Excuse me. Sean, I need to speak to you now. I was in a kind of an important conversation. Did you talk to Jen about our personal life? What? No. Then how come she knows about our miscarriages? I... [stammering] I don't know. I mean, maybe one night when we were talking late in the office, it just happened to come up. It just came up? What? You know I didn't want you to talk to anybody about that, let alone some floozy like her! You might think I'm stupid. But I know that you set me up with that video. And I know that you're trying to steal my husband. Well, you are not going to succeed, because I'm gonna make sure that you are put behind bars. It's really unfortunate that you feel this way, Lisa. Because I was just beginning to really like you. In fact, I was thinking that maybe some day soon we were gonna be friends. You can go to hell! Hey, hey, hey, we're... What the hell are you doing? I'm putting an end to this whore's BS! Do you have to do that here, huh? Sean. I need you and Jen at the microphone now. Yes, Ma'am. -Honey, listen-- -Don't! I'll be waiting in the car. I'm sorry. I don't, I don't... I don't know what got into me. You know that there is nothing going on between Jen and I, right? Yeah. I know. What? Not... No, it's nothing. What's funny? You, you... I... re... I remember you called her a floozy and the entire room heard it! How was I supposed to know I was standing next to a live microphone? You know, it doesn't matter, 'cause she deserved it. So embarrassing. I'm sorry. You know I love you, right? I love you. And I don't even care if I ever see Jen again 'cause she's such a terrible girl, and she steals people's w-work and takes their credit from 'em and... She's a horrible girl, I'm telling you. This is not fun. Hey, there. This is Sean. Give me your name and number and I'll call you back. Hey, this is Ray and I need to talk to you. Jen is still here at the party and she is drunk out of her mind and she is spoutin' off some pretty interesting things and... Well, I-I don't mean to shock you but I just heard her tell somebody that she set your house on fire. Call me back ASAP. Uh, Ray. Oh, what do you want? Listen. I feel like you and I are having some issues. And I'd like to start over with you. Like, reset our relationship. I don't think so. Ray. Please. It's never gonna happen. In fact, tomorrow, I am gonna recommend to Katie that she gets you fired. Really? And why do you feel that way? I don't know what you're up to, but ever since Sean came to our office, you have been acting like a little... like a little devil. A devil? Really? It's an extreme description. Don't you think, Ray? Well, I think setting someone's house on fire is extreme. And why would you think I'd do something like that? Because, genius, I heard you telling your drunk girlfriends. Tomorrow morning, I'm calling the police. Oh, you are, are you? You are... done. I hope you like the color orange. And why is that? 'Cause that's gonna be the color that you're gonna be wearing for the next 20 years. I'll see you in hell, Ray. Is he okay? Are you sure? Yeah. I am ready to have a family. -I love you. -I love you. Sean! -Katie, you okay? -Y-you weren't there? -Where? What? -The party. You must've left early. Ray slipped and fell down the stairs. -Is he okay? -No, he's dead. The police are here, they wanna question you. Why would they wanna talk to me? You were the last person Ray called before he died. Oh, I'm-I'm not aware of that, I lost my phone. Well, they have reason to believe that he might've been pushed. Pushed? Who in the world would wanna kill Ray? I don't know. Guess you missed all the fireworks last night, huh? Yeah, I guess so. His body was twisted like a pretzel. Jen! How can you say that? What? I-I'm just describing what I saw. Officer, this is Sean Miller. Sean, this is Officer Murran. Sir, I'm here to help. Whatever you need. Hello, Mr. Miller, I appreciate it. Uh, would you mind if we go in the room? Hey, you okay? Yeah, I guess. Yeah, it's a little devastating, but... I really didn't even know the guy. Yeah. Listen, Jen, I... I wanna say I'm sorry for, you know... my wife, Lisa, last night. It's okay. She was drunk, I understand. Hm, actually, no, she wasn't. No, she didn't even have a drink. Babe... I tried to call you last night but you didn't answer. I'm sorry, I lost my phone. What are you doin'? I don't know, I just... I thought we had a moment there. Didn't you? You want me to kiss you? No, I don't think I gave you that signal. Oh, come on, Sean! We have so much more chemistry than you and Lisa. You know that. -I'm your work wife. -Okay, you know what? -I know you want me! -Stop. Jen, come on, I am married, okay? I'm not gonna go and cheat on my wife. You already have. What are you talking about? I see the way you look at me. You have lust in your heart, Sean. And that's cheating. But that's okay. We could be the ultimate power couple. Come on, Sean! Please. You know you want me, I don't know why you're playing games. No, I don't. My God. You know what? You're... You're certifiable. Well, I know she's been here longer than I have but I really feel that you need to let her go. Don't you feel you should take some responsibility for what's been going on between you two? Absolutely not. You've not lead her on at all? No, I'm married. Come on, Sean. I've seen the two of you together. You do not act like a married man around her. I'm a social guy, Katie. I like to have fun. Look... you're a man. I know too well what men are like. In fact, my husband cheated on me. And I kicked his arse right out of that door. Okay, please don't take this personal but just because your husband cheated on you that doesn't mean all men cheat. Frankly, yes. Well, I don't. Yes, you do. I've seen the way you look at her. You're just as responsible. And as her superior, you should've done something to stop that behavior. Okay, you know, I-I don't know what's going on around here, but ever since I've got here, it feels like every woman's out to get me. Maybe it's time for a little introspection, Mr. Miller. Honestly... the only reason why you're still here is because of the Gin Tonic account. Feels a little slimy to be used, doesn't it? Well... welcome to a woman's world. Thanks for comin'. Yeah. All right, I'm-I'm just gonna jump right into this. Jen, I-I wanna apologize. I really... I really need to take some responsibility for what happened between us. I know I blamed everything on you and I should've just kept our relationship strictly business. Jen, I love my wife. Okay? And having said that... I'm leaving the company. And I would appreciate it if you not contact me when I leave, okay? You're quitting? -Yeah. -Because of me? I think it's best. I mean, Katie thinks I'm partially responsible so I think it's best for everyone. Well, you are responsible. I mean, you're my superior and you've been hitting on me since the moment we met. -No, I haven't. -Yes, you have, Sean. Don't play stupid. We both know how much you want me. I could've had you in my bed anytime I wanted. You were so weak. You know what, Jen? You're right. I'm weak. All men are weak. That's why I'm quitting, okay? And I'm sure Katie's gonna give you my job so, congrats on the promotion. No! If you leave, I swear to God I'll make things a lot worse. -Are you threatening me? -No, Sean. I'm doing this because I love you. I'll tell Katie about how you stole Ray's notes. -I didn't steal Ray's notes. -Yes, you did, Sean. Yes, you did, you walked right into his office and you stole them. He was your competition, wasn't he? Right? Oh! Oh, oh. Here's your cellphone, I copied all the emails and text messages. And I have no problem telling Katie about all the threatening emails you've been sending me. Go ahead, no one's ever gonna believe you. And I'll destroy your relationship with Lisa. How could you even say something like that? Maybe if she's finally out of the picture, we can be together. You know what, Jen? You're really sad. I'm outta here. -He's quitting. -Good. We've had nothing but trouble ever since he showed up here. I'm sorry I even hired him. Are you done? Oh, yeah. Look, d-don't worry, at least we'll have your severance to cover us for a while. Yeah. Well, you don't get a severance... when you quit. Right. Hey, this is Ray and I need to talk to you. Jen is still here at the party and she is drunk out of her mind. I just heard her tell somebody that she set your house on fire. Call me back ASAP. What are you doing here? It's after midnight. I know it's late. And I'm really sorry. But I just felt like you needed to know the truth as soon as possible. The truth about what? The truth about Sean and I. Can I just come inside and explain? Please. Please. Thank you. Hi, you've reached Jen. Leave a message. Yeah, I figured I'd get your voicemail again. It's done, Jen. I've already filed a police report. They're picking your ass up in the morning. And don't worry about packing anything, Jen. They have everything you need, you're going to jail for a very long time. And then he gave me this. See? It's engraved. The hell are you doin' here? Lisa, stay away from her. I told her the truth about us, Sean. What are you talkin' about? There is no truth about us, Jen. Stop lying, Sean. I'm not lying, nothing happened. Really? What about these? All these emails, texts and IMs. Look at these, all talking about how you wanna be with her. And you got this lovely pen. "XOXO." Your lying is all done. Why'd you do this? For her, Sean. So you both could finally be free. For us. It's time for you to get the hell outta my house. My... We belong together. I promise you. I promise you, Lisa. Sean! No! Please. Sean! Lisa, she is lying. Okay? She hacked into my computer. That pen, she bought that pen for me. Stop it, Sean. No, you listen to me. I think she's the one that tried to kill the senior copywriter. Okay, I was up all night doin' research. Sean... Oh, my God. She is emotionally unhinged but she's not a murderer. She tried to burn down our house! What? This is absurd! I've already filed a police report and they're picking her up in the morning. You've broken my heart. You've made a fool out of me. And now I'm done. I'm getting the hell outta here. Well, I'm so glad you left the house. Made it really easy for me to give you a ride to the office. Sorry if I was a little rough on you. So he's coming. I just talked to him and he's coming. He told me he'd never hurt you for me. But he changed his mind. Did you hear me? He changed his mind! I know it sounds crazy... but I love him. I do. I can't help myself. I fall in love with all of my bosses. My father didn't love me. So I look for it in men that I work for. But I promise you, the feelings are real. I love him, and it's real. You should try following your real feelings some day 'cause it's really liberating. Shoot. I should go freshen up. Don't you move. I love him. He's mine. He should be mine. He'd understand. Lisa! No! No! No. No! Lisa! Lisa! Sean! Sean. Sweetie. Do you see what I did? I made it easy for you. You love me, Sean. You just needed a little push. But now you can finish it. Right? Come on, honey. It's locked and loaded. Just pull the trigger. Jen, please calm down. I am calm. I'm calmer than I've ever been because I can see your future. We can run away together. Just you and me. Jen, I-I can't do that. Kill her, Sean! Kill her. Or I will kill you both and make it look like that you did it. And you've been sending me threatening emails for weeks. It won't be hard to prove. Right? Y-you're right. You're right, Jen, I have... and I'm sorry. I should've said something earlier. I knew the first time when I laid eyes on you that I was gonna fall in love with you. I-I don't love her. I haven't loved her for years. I'll do it. How do I know you will? Just trust me. Oh, you're so beautiful. I love you. Don't move! -You lied to me! -No! Yes! You lied to me. I was just trying to get the gun away from you. You lied to me! I was trying to get the... Honey. Honey! I got it. Here. Stop it! You stop! Stay back, honey. Stop, stop. Think about what you're doing. I love you, Sean. I'll shoot you both. Don't. Sean? It's over. Baby, it's over. Oh, my God. Sean? Yeah, honey. Did you hear that? Hear what? It's just, it's just me. I'm sorry, I think I'm... still pretty freaked out about what happened. Hey, hey, it's okay. We're fine. She's very far away and she'll never hurt us again. Any of us. Come here. I still can't believe that bullet didn't go through her heart. Well... it's because she doesn't have a heart. Yeah. -Major kicks. -Okay, sit down. -Sit, sit, sit, sit. -Yeah, let's sit. It's dancin'. Prop your foot up here for me a second. Okay. I'm really impressed. You have made real progress here. Thank you, Dr. Larison. We thought, with your past experience, and the kindness that you've shown to the other patients, you would work well... one-on-one, helping people. So, you'll be here, with me. So, we'll be working together? If you like. Really? Yes, um, I'd like that very much. Thank you, Doctor. Can I ask you a question? Of course, Jennifer. Well, I was wondering... if while we're working together, if I... What? Don't be afraid to ask. That's why we're here. Well, I was just wondering if while we're working together, if I could... be your... My what? Your work wife. I feel like you could really help me, if it was my job to support you and take care of everything here for you. For better or for worse. Well, I don't see why not. Thank you.
