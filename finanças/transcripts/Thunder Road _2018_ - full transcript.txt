Hey, guys, go on in. I'll be right there, thank you for coming. We would like to thank everyone for coming out to celebrate the life of Brenda Amelia Arnaud. Brenda was well-loved. She spent her life as as accountant and a dance instructor. Jim, we love you; we're here for you. - Oh! Yeah, thanks. - You're gonna get through it. She lived to the age of 54. Thanks a lot. Oh, thank you. She left us too soon. She was survived by three children, Shane, Morgan, and James. James is with us here today, and he's like to say a few words. James, would you please join us, please? Oh yeah. Yeah, thanks. Sorry. Do you have everything you need? You're prepared? Oh yeah, no, I'm fine. Thank you so much. Hey, everybody. Thank you for coming. Brenda was a free spirit. She was a wonderful mother. She had three children. My brother and my sister couldn't make it today but I've spoken to them on the phone. She had 7 grandkids who loved her very much. She was a certified public account, and she ran the dance academy here in town until about 2009? Next to the old drug store. My mother didn't believe in any of this! Not that that's a bad thing, she never judged anybody and, loved everybody, and cared for everybody, and never put herself first, it seems like hearing some- sorry yeah, thank you so much for comin Kevin, Matt, we got people here, Judy Thank you, it means a lot, thank you My mother was an extremely charitable woman she donated to my school once when I was a kid There was this girl in my grade named Caitlin and she had Down's Syndrome or she had something she was she, no, she was a she was horrible-she was a bitch, this girl and I know you're not supposed to say that about a little girl, bless her heart, but she used to bite kids a lot and she'd just come out at you and, I, the nightmares I used to have She actually bit a teacher and Anyway My mom donated, like, a thousand dollars to the school, because She wasn't allowed to play on the play structures it was too dangerous but my Mom wanted her to - so they built her a little playhouse and my Mom donated like a thousand dollars and she didn't like the idea of her being left out and she did it all anonymously! She didn't tell anybody about it or anything and I don't have that in me. Whatever that is, but uh, it was her, and- I opened the door for somebody this morning and I got angry that they didn't say thanks Sorry. I had some stuff, uh, I had some stuff written down. You're fine. When you're a kid and you think about stuff, you learn about America and the founding- Thomas Jefferson and all that. But when you're a kid, you think about it and say "Yeah, you know, these guys they did all this." It doesn't mean anything to you. And then you grow up, and you realize, these guys were incredible and they were just people like us, who lived, and loved- had a kid! And then you think about your mom and your dad and the stories they used to tell you when you were growing up, of them, being young. And before I called her Mom she was Brenda. Sorry. I don't know if I can keep going. Keep going, you've got this. Yeah? You can do this, go on. That's cool. Yeah, no, I'm fine. She was just so wonderful and I gave her hell growing up we gave each other hell and... it gets to you when you grow up and I'm one of the good guys now! But I was just mean to her I'd lie to her I didn't mean to be John Wayne. I tell my daughter sometimes, "Hey, never say anything mean to me." Not for my sake, obviously, you know, I can take it I'm a grown man. But you would just hate for her to have to look back and I was just stupid. I was just so stupid. I have, um- I am a dyslexic. I never even think about it really, when I was in high school I had to listen to all of these books on tape it looks like the words are all jumbled up when you're reading I can do it, I'm just not that fast but when I went to school at LSU Go Tigers. We found out they weren't gonna have anything like that for my textbooks and so my Mom bought a little tape recorder- and so she and so she'd read all the things that I had to read so I could do well in school that's all she wanted. Screwed that up. And I'd say "hey thanks Mom, for doing that" "that means a lot, sending it to me in the mail", but she must have been up so late and it gets to you when you grow up it eats you alive. I'm so sorry, I'm so I had it planned, I wasn't-I Go ahead, you're fine. Anywho! My mom was a big fan of Bruce Springsteen she loved Bruce Springsteen and "Bruce Springsteen" meant leaving your small town and going to do something with your life and she said that she wouldn't have left if she hand't heard him-she loved him so much. I'm so sorry. She used to sing Thunder Road to me when I was going to sleep and I'm not a singer, or a dancer- or you know, anything my daughter is the creative one, but people said it'd be a good idea if I brought it in, so so I brought it in and, uh Yeah, so I'm gonna sing it. Okay... I had it working this morning, I promise. Come on just fucking work. Come on, please, just-sorry. It's not gonna work, uh yeah! Could you do that? That'd be great It's, uh, it's just Track 4 thank you so much. Uh, it's a beautiful song, How do you explain it? It's a song this guy, telling this girl to leave their small town forever to change their lives- Should we just call the manufacturer? Change their lives forever for the better and my Mom really loved it- It's not gonna work? No, he's saying it's not gonna work. I'm sorry, uh well Typical! I uh- I don't even know if it's gonna work without the song to be honest with you but I did a lot of planning for it and I love my Mom and so I'm just gonna do it, and I don't know what else to do, so- It starts out and there's a harmonica and this girl walks out on her porch and she's listening to Roy Orbison and back in the day Roy Orbison used to sing songs for sad and lonely people so they wouldn't be sad and lonely anymore. It's a beautiful song. You can find it. Actually they whole thing is on YouTube I have it on my phone I could have just done that now that I think about it. I'm just gonna do it. Uh, I'm gonna be sick. Sorry. Crystal, go sit back down with Mommy. Crystal, please go sit back down with Mommy, honey. Crystal, go sit, uh I'm sorry, I didn't even get half-I'm sorry It's ok honey.

Anything I can help you with? Yeah, I need to buy a scanner I think. But it's gotta be something that'll hook up to my laptop from work. Is that even something you guys would have? So down the middle, they're saying it's gonna be 1248 and 70 cents. Is that something y'all can handle right now? What do you think about Shane? Do you think he's in a place to take that on? There is nothing, really. What do they say? A third of zero is still zero? No, Morgan, I'm not gonna sell the dance academy. That thing's a money maker. I'm gonna go in there myself and clean it up, you'll see. And split that income three ways. I don't care if all of your children want saxophone lessons. That is never going to happen. It was fine, it was intense. I wasn't expecting that. I'm glad I was there, though. Not like that. No, stop! I didn't mean it like that. I meant that I'm glad that I was there for her because I didn't have a whole lot of that growing up. - Wait a minute! - Stand up. Hold on a sec! I know this boy's mother! Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

Nothin' better to do out here. You're telling me there's nothin' better to do in this town than make out with these two slickers in a parking lot outside of the Dillard's? Yeah. All right, well, that hasn't been my experience. How 'bout I give you a ride home. No, sir, my mom would kill me if she saw me get dropped off in a cop car. All right, well, I don't have to fuckin' drop you off right outside. I can drop you off around the corner or something like that. I'm not leavin' a 16-year-old in a parking lot with two slickers.

Yeah, that was really something to see the other day. Yeah, well, I lost my mom, and she woulda loved it, so. It was just, never seen anything like that. All the people I've been speaking to say that's pretty normal, actually. When you talk about losing somebody. Really? What people you been speaking to? You can move that. People. Yeah, I heard that part of it. What people? I don't know, people. What do you want? Leave me alone. - If I'm hearing you right... - Seatbelt on.

I'm happy to talk about anything and everything regarding her. And I wanted to say that I'm sorry about everything that I said about you getting hit by a train. That was an off-color joke, obviously. I would hate to see anything bad happen to you, for Crystal's sake. Uh so, yeah, so OK, I'll leave you to it. Take care. I'm so sorry you had to hear that, Claire. Oh, that's fine, I wasn't listening. You can talk out here anytime, sweetie, it's all right. But I wouldn't let anybody walk all over me. I am so sorry to hear about all that. So what d'you wanna do? I wanna drag her behind my truck with an extension cord. I don't mean that, don't listen to me. I'm just talkin'. Yeah, we went through this, me and Sandra. At least I got to keep the house and my pension. Oh, fuck, I didn't even think about that. I got a lady, name is Donna. She's not cheap, but she's the best in the state. Money. So I don't think I'm handlin' this whole thing that great. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, I'm glad you're done with that everything's fine bullshit. Hey, man, it's a good step. Why don't you come over tonight. We're having a barbecue at my place. No! I'm busy. So I, hey... So I danced to that event the other day. That event, you know what I'm talkin' about? She was a dancer. I wanted to say goodbye, I don't really know how. I think people thought I was making the whole thing about me instead of about her. Shane and Morgan didn't show up. Somebody's filming it on their fuckin' phone. I heard about that; I took care of it. So you... That guy doesn't have that footage anymore? Nope. Unless he's a scuba diver. Hey, Crystal, stop, hold on. I gotta talk to you about something important. What? Who's that boy I saw you talkin' with at school today? What? Oh, that was Tony. Yeah, is Tony a slicker? What? Does Tony think he's real slick? I don't know. Look, I got nothing against the guy. I just think maybe we don't hang out with Tony too much anymore, OK? Why? It's just Tony. Look, please just listen to me. I know what I'm talkin' about, honey. You give a mouse a cookie... Hey, I love you! I'll see you on Monday! Jimmy, Roz tell you about us maybe keeping Crystal? Lord, thank you for this food and for watching over our boys in their work. Please continue to watch over our family and our friends in their time of need. We ask all this in Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Amen, Celia, that was really beautiful. Thank you for saying that. Oh, thank you for joining our family. You always have a spot at this table. Tell another story about Dad. Hey, Jay, man, let him eat. Probably know all the good ones, ones that got him decorated. You lookin' for more funny ones there, Ryan? - Yeah. - Yeah? You know the one about the breaking and entering about a year ago? No. Dad and I got a call, and it was a breaking and entering at this house by the interstate. It was actually one of the first calls we got, right? Yeah, drive there, pull up. All the neighbors are out on the front lawn. Dad stays outside, I go inside. It's every sign of a robbery. Front door's open, furniture's flipped, all these cabinets are open. There's nobody there, I clear the house. I come back outside. Your dad's still talkin' to the neighbor. I guess they went to high school together. You went to Jesuit, is that right? Yeah, small town. Anyway, I come up, your dad's saying, "Hey, brother, you got a card on you?" He goes, "Yeah," and he reaches into his pocket. When he pulls his hand out, his watch catches on all these gold necklaces, and they fall out on the sidewalk, and we both pull guns on him, didn't we? We did! Now that shit's funny! I don't get it. Dad went to help somebody and it turns out that they were the ones who had stolen from the house. How come you couldn't tell? 'Cause sometimes your father only sees the good in people. So, Celia, I saw those pictures of y'all at the farmers' market. Those were really beautiful. Thank you, Nate took those on his phone, but they turned out great, right? They did! How did you guys even hear that there was a farmers' market uptown? Oh, um, I don't even know. It was on a sign or someone... I forget. Do you remember? Nope. Yeah, is there like a website or like a chatroom that'll fill me in on stuff that's happening around town? I always see this stuff late, and it looks like stuff that we really would've loved to do. I don't know; it's a good idea. I can certainly send you some stuff... I would love that, honestly, really. - And anything really. - OK. I'm just lookin' for fun kinda family-style activities, a frameable moment, you know what I mean? I do. Um, we can all go together next time. You can borrow our photographer. I'd like that, and hell, I'll trade ya. You can have the recipe for my potato salad, if that's even something you guys would like. I need you to step away from that door and throw that fucking weapon down! Put the weapon down, sir! Put the weapon down! Dude, do not go back! Do not go back! Shit! Come back with hands up, come back out of the curtains, sir! Sir! Come back out and talk to us, sir. We're here to help you! Sir, we just wanna have a conversation. Would you put the knife down. I-I just went to the bathroom! I need you to leave. - Ma'am, I need you to go. - Now? - I need, now, now! - Go now? Come now, come now, go! Sir, you put that weapon down and come out here, we'll all be leaving here on two feet. You understand me? Super gritty. Yeah, big time. Sir, I need you to come out with your hands up and nothing in them. Otherwise, I can't ensure your safety. Sir, can you hear me? Sir, I need an auditory response! I got him. Nate, I got him, he's down. Code four, he's out, I got him. He's drunk. Wait. Wait. - Sorry. - Come on! Call it in... Call for downtown unit, 11:39. Call a bus!

Mr. Arnaud, thank you so much for coming in. Thank you for having me. Officer Arnaud! - I'm so sorry! - Totally fine. Did I miss Crystal and Roz? No, I don't know. I don't think they're comin' in tonight. But you're here, that's what's important. - Yeah, while I have you, - Yeah. I wanted to let you know that I'm gonna be the point person for Crystal's education in the coming years, just so you can pass that on to the administration. OK, I will, thank you. Shall we sit? Sure. Is everything all right? Oh, I'm fine. I'm workin'. See me wrestling an alligator, help... How are you? I'm great, I'm great, yeah. The kids are really good this year. Good, except for Crystal. No, no not at all, I wouldn't say that. I mean, they're kids, right? They're kids, obviously they're all gonna be different. And you're saying it's her classwork she's not excelling at, is that right? It's more her performance in class. She can be kind of strident with some of the other kids, and we just wanted to get you in and talk about it. I see. So you're gonna have to tell me what strident means. I went to LSU. Actually, they said they had to stop making ice over there 'cause the student with the recipe graduated. Oh, yeah. Uh, Crystal is disruptive, and she won't listen to me or her other teachers. I see, I'm sorry to hear that. Look, I mean, I have trouble with her listening, too. Straight up, I'm the first to admit it. I don't know how much you know, kind of about what my family's goin' through right now? - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. And, look, I'm just the messenger here, but we do have to think about what's best for all the kids. Sure. And so we think it might just be a simple solution of moving her to another homeroom, and then observing how she gets along. Yeah, see, the problem with that is, her little friend Caroline's in this class, and we think that might be the only thing that's keeping her straight. Yeah, actually, we already had to separate them 'cause they were talkin' too much. So if we move her out, they're not gonna miss each other at all. Oh. See, I didn't know that. I get it. You know, when kids are outside of the home, the parents can't see how they're behaving. So this can be surprising. Oh, she's misbehaving? Well, she used expletives against some of the other students, and she taught them what they meant, yeah. All right. What kind of expletives are we talkin' about here? Primarily the one where someone pleases a gentleman with their mouth. Yep. And then there was another one where, in an LGBT relationship, or I guess really in any relationship and there's a man and then someone else standing behind that man, and then they, they... The one behind uses their hand to reach around to, - well, it's a reach-around. - I see. Is what it is, she called my classwork a reach-around. - I am so sorry to hear that. - Mm-hmm. I'm certain that couldn't be further from the truth. You clearly run a tight ship. I do! Let's not, let me first clarify for you that she's getting that language at her mother's house and not from me. Mm-hmm, understood. Look, you can't blame Crystal for this kinda stuff. Even with the homework thing, she gets an assignment on a Monday. She does it, but she leaves it at her mom's house. I have her for the next few days. She doesn't get to you for a week, - sometimes weeks at a time. - Right. She gets demerits on it. That's the problem of living between two homes. Don't blame her for that, that's on us. She's a good student. Well, she's also been exhibiting some pretty serious reading difficulties. Well, now, that she would've gotten from me. - I'm sorry. - Mr. Ar... You gotta give me a minute, I'm so sorry. I'm gonna have to hold onto this desk for a minute. - Please. - You gotta stop. You never wanna hear that. You never wanna hear you passed on something terrible to a child. Sorry, I'm gonna have to walk around for a second. - Mr. Arnaud? - You gotta stop that! You gotta stop talkin' to me, man, shithead. I didn't mean to call you that. I'm sorry, that just came out, and now you think I'm probably the bad parent 'cause I cursed in front of you. This whole thing was about her cursing. We danced around it for like five minutes. This is a fucking nightmare. - No, no, c'mon... - Here I am! I cursed again! Let's calm down, let's calm down. Give me a demerit, see if I give a shit, I don't care. Dude, I will hum this desk across the room so fast. I prefer you don't; that's Crystal's desk. Put the desk down. Please! Stuff on the floor. Crystal is temporarily a problem child. She's not the worst. She's certainly not gonna be the last. We just needed to get you in here so we could form a united front against the problematic behavior. - And I think that's great. - Great. Thank you for coming in. - Thank you for having me. - OK. If you have any other questions, you can feel free to reach out, and I'm gonna probably send some reading comprehension lessons home as a PDF tonight. I'm goin' through a divorce. I understand. It's an emotional time for everybody. We good? Yeah, we're good. - Thank you. - Take care. Sorry I'm late, Jim Arnaud. Yes, Donna. - Hi. - Hi, nice to meet you. - Please, slide in. - Thank you, thank you. Whoo, you're gonna be fine. Glad you wore the uniform, that'll do us good. Now, remind me what this is. It's divorce proceedings. Oh! I know, I know, OK. Uh, any verbal abuse, any trauma, any history? No, she just stopped loving me. We have a daughter together. OK, and we are arguing for joint custody. You don't want to fight for sole custody? Oh, I don't think so. Why not? I think she should have her mom. What's up? McCarthy's tough. He's gonna be difficult, he's an asshole. You don't say anything you don't have to. It's best that I take care of everything. That's right. All rise! The Honorable John Aldredge McCarthy. Arnaud v. Arnaud. Defense? Your honor, Mrs. Arnaud, who filed the suit, is not with us today, is asking for half her husband's salary and pension along with complete custody of the couple's daughter Crystal which we're arguing is gross overreaction to circumstances and superficial testimony. OK, let's get the father up here. So, I... He asked, he asked for me, so now I go up? - Yes, you need to go up. - So now I go up. How are you, your honor? How are you, officer? I'm doin' just fine, I'm here for my daughter today. You have a good job, clearly. I do indeed. And you're decorated! I am, your honor. Any strikes on your record? None. I'm here fightin' for my daughter today. I'd like to continue joint custody with my wife, which is what we've done for the last year, since everything. I have no problem with the way that she raises our child. I'm a good police officer. And your wife has never given you cause for concern with her child rearing? I... That's not, no, short answer. I see no problem with the way that Roz raises Crystal. She has many problems of her own. We have a very separate take on how we raise our child from our problems with each other. We have a united front against her problematic behavior, and Roz is working on her issues right now. I've been assured, and I'm certain that she is. The court has testimony that you practiced reckless or violent behavior, a public event, a funeral this month. Any of that hold water? I wasn't violent. I wasn't violent. I was upset for sure, I lost somebody I loved, but I wasn't violent. And actually everybody I've been speaking to say that's pretty normal when you find out what losing somebody in your life means. I hope that when you're lookin' at the coffin of somebody you love, you act with a little more grace than I did. Is that a threat? Absolutely not. No, I'm sorry, let's go back. I didn't mean for it to come out that way. Why don't you go back and sit down with your counsel. I'm so sorry. No! Let's go... That's, I didn't mean it like that. I don't have to go back and... That's, let's just have a conversation. That's why I came up here in the first place. You're on one side of the law, I'm on the other. I thought we were gonna have a heart-to-heart or somethin' like that. Why don't you go sit back down with your counsel. 'Cause now I'm scared I'm gonna lose my daughter 'cause I said somethin' stupid to the judge. Thank you so much, your honor. Why did you let me do that? - Why did you let me do that? - Don't, don't, don't. What did I do wrong? The fuck off, Chris. Don't show any emotion. You just stand up, leave, go home, and we will go back to my offices in the morning, and we will file a motion for a continuation. So what does that mean, we lost? That means we lost today. No, listen, no, because we're gonna file a motion for... I think we can reach a tentative ruling. We have an exhibit I am told we are not to miss! Clerk, please, the exhibit. Fuck! Jim! What happened? What do you mean, what happened? What happened? They had the footage at the courtroom! What happened with what? I thought you took care of it! What? What? I thoughtyou took care of it! They had the fucking footage in the courtroom! I-I-I-I did! I threw it in the fuckin' lake! Or, he musta got, it's, it's up in the cloud! What? No, they had it in the fuckin' ourtroom! The cloud? What're you talkin' about, asshole! What're you talkin' about? I did... - They fuckin' had the thing... - I did my job! I tried! I paid your fucki' fancy lawyer... Calm down, man, that's not necessary! - You don't have to... - I had to fuckin' pay for your fuckin' lawyer, asshole! - Don't you fuckin' hit me! - You fuckin' ass... - Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! - Stay down! - Stay down! Stop! - Ow! The fuck! You ripped my pants! You fuckin' hit me! You ripped my pants, asshole! You punched me in the face! You slapped in in the fuckin' face! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! You ripped my fuckin' pnts! You ruined my life! - I never ruined your life! - You ruined my... I saw that goddamned video! Who dances at a fuckin' funeral! In my culture, we do that! That's our... That's not your fuckin' culture! - Fuck you! - Don't put this shit on me! I spent all this money on your fuckin' lawyer, and I lost, asshole! I've always been a good friend to you, - You ruined my life! - You sad son of a bitch! You ruined my fuckin' life! I'll tell the rest of these mother fuckers about... - You have a nice family! - Jimmy. - You don't have problems! - Jimmy. - Yes, I do! - No, you don't! Yes, I do! James Edward! What! It's fine. It's all right. I'm putting it away. Put the gun down now! No, it's really fine. I'm just glad he put it away in time. It's not fine. You put the gun down, you put the badge down. That's quite enough out of you! Oh, what, am I fired? Yes. Why, 'cause of this? This is nothing! This guy is my brother, this guy's... Oh, all right. Yeah, that's fine. I don't fuckin' care, that's fine. I don't wanna fuckin' work here anyway. Y'all can take my shit. You think I give a shit? I had to watch a guy fall on his fuckin' knife last week! You think I need that shit right now? You're a bad influence. I'm a bad influence? I'm the most decorated motherfucker out here! I'm a bad influence. Think I give a shit? They don't know, they don't know. They don't know! They don't know! They don't know. You want me to talk? Yeah, I'll talk. Ask me to talk, fuck, I'll talk all day, the day I'm havin'. Yeah, you don't want me to talk. I got dirt on all a y'all! Shit! Fuck! I'll be out here, try gettin' off duty! I will ruin the parking lot experience for all of you! I'll talk all night, right here, motherfuckers. I'll start with myself. My wife left me a year and a half ago. There, laugh it up! Does that change anything? No! Am I cured? 'Course not! Talkin' about your problems never helped anybody ever! I slept in my car! Right here, three weeks! Jerry saw it, isn't that right, Jerry? Yeah, I brought you breakfast. Thank you so much for doing that, Jerry. That meant a lot back then. But fuck you right now. You're drunk! I'm not drunk; I'm angry. I realize that, I'll calm... No! I won't calm down! I lost my daughter today! And I did everything right! She was comin'! I got married, man, my whole family was there! It was beautiful! I haven't had a good night's sleep since 2009 because of this shit! Fuck! For what! So I could impress you overweight assholes! I gave up my fuckin' family! Why? For decorations? For armed marksman! You think I give a shit about armed marksman! Clara! Fuck you. And the rest of it! What? You want my pants, too! Fine! Fuck you, you can keep 'em, I don't care. You can't hurt me! You think you're fuckin' hurtin' me? I found out she lost her boyfriend in Vietnam! I never asked her about it! Why? I never made the time. I was selfish. This is what you get! I'm walkin' home. I hope they take my house. Now I really have nothin'. I really have nothin'. I hope I get hit by a truck full of fuckin' cement. Jimmy! Brother Nathaniel! You ready to lose some money? Didn't go so well. Didn't go so well, huh? Judge was not a nice guy. Yeah, that happens, man. I'm sorry if I committed a hate crime against you. Yeah, I... I forgive you. Hey, why don't you come on downstairs, and we play some cards? I don't know what I'm doing anymore. Cleanin' the house, the vacuum cleaner stopped workin'. I turned it over, and it was all caught up in her hair. It was perfect. Looked just like the top of her little head. I kissed it. I kissed the vacuum cleaner. I was lookin' into getting an above-ground pool for the backyard. I went down to the showroom. This guy Ray-ray showed me around. I thought they'd be expensive. They're pretty reasonable, actually. I was hoping we could've been one of the cool kids in high school. They'd all come over here and cut up. I'd stay out of the way. They'd all be out there at night. I'd let 'em think they were gettin' away with murder, but I'd be the one to call all the parents and say, "Yeah, they're here, and yeah, they're drinkin', "but they're safe; I'm keepin' an eye on 'em." I don't know what I'm doin' anymore, man. Hey, is he there? Is he hurt? No, no, no, no, he's uh... he's fine. Listen, I... I need you to come get me from Jim's in a couple of hours. - Can you do that? - Really? OK. Great, all right. Hey... I love you. I love you so much, we're so lucky. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry. - Yeah, all right, I love you. - I love you. Hey! What happened to the fridge? Um, yeah. There was a fist fight. I thought it was a burglar. OK. Wait, are we still goin' to dinner? Nope, we're doin' this. Two. I don't even know where that one went! She was doin' this thing. She was selling medical equipment online. I think she went to Cincinnati, and she texted me once. I was here, and she said, "Hey, you wanna make out?" And I think she was drunk, or at least she said she was drunk. But from the beginning, I thought she must be texting somebody else and accidentally texted me. Hey, asshole. And I called her out on it, and I spent the week in a motel. - Hmmm? - No, no, no, not yet. I'm fuckin' Babe Ruth! Well, then, you fuckin' better... Woo-hee! Hit me again. I can, I can fix that for you. Lemme see. I mean, we got this thing a couple years ago. It's a piece of shit. - Lemme see. - Whatever. Yeah, look, these are all done up for knuckles so you can put your hands down like that. So you gotta make sure that when you're doin' it, it's like exactly for the palm of the hand so that it fits perfectly in. They say a stitch in time saves nine. So you do it once right, you don't have to do it nine times in the future. Sounds good to me. Thanks for comin' over, man. Glad to do it, man. That's what I'm here for. Oh! Stop! Hey, oh my god! You guys got so big! How's it goin'? Good. You mom home? Yes. All right. Gimme one of these. Oh, hey, man! Take it easy, you'll break my hand. What, are you Hulk Hogan? Get outta here. - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey, Morgan. How are you? How was your drive? Oh, it was fine. Yeah, it's two hours. It's uh, I can do it in one sitting. Well, come on in. Can I get you somethin'? Ah, I'm fine. Actually, a big glass of water would be great. Sure. So it's all settled? How was it? It was tough. A lot of people were there. Everybody's asking for ya. Not like they were bein' rude. They just missed seeing you and Jeff and the kids. They've grown up. They have. I heard that would happen. With Peyton, he's at practice, I just wanna put a brick on his head and keep him at the same size forever. It's a good age. So you got your appeal coming up? That's good news. Yeah, my attorney has it all figured out. She wants me to attack Roz's character moving forward, problems with everything. I've been forthwith with you about all that. I don't want to make her out to be some kind of a... A B-word in front of a judge, but now they're thinkin' I shoulda just been honest, that my wife, in fact, in this case, specifically, is probably the biggest one of them all. Thank you so much. So we're just doin' that until the fifth, tweakin' it everyday, makin' it perfect. I'm takin' some time off. Captain's asked me to, um... Uh... It's a mess, Morgan. The whole thing's a mess. Did you hear about when Mom had to back out of the conservatory? What's that? No. Mom had her knee happen earlier in the year, and Brittany Ray had just taken over at the ballet or, or I think it was around then, that they had come to her to do Swan Lake. And she'd done it in the '90s. Actually, I think it was seein' that show that made her want to be a dancer. Pawpaw took her; she was just a kid. Anyhow, they wanted her for it. For Odette, the princess role? And it was just for the Tulane Conservatory, you know. It was no big deal or nothin', but she went through three rounds of callbacks before she finally admitted that she had had the surgery, and that workin' so hard and doing those rehearsals was the real reason that she ruined her knee. She couldn't do it anymore. That's why she taught from the chair. When was that? Would've been after the storm, 2006, 2007. I have no memory of that. Where wa... Was I at the academy? Oh, she never told anybody. I had to hear about it from Brittany last week. I mean, can you imagine? She was driving an hour every night to kill her knee because she couldn't admit to anyone that she wasn't up to it. God, she was sneaky like that. That's how we lost her. Anyway. What was it like growin' up with her as a mom? As a daughter, I mean. You feel like, as a girl, growin' up with a mom was enough? It was fine. Everybody wants two parents. I got no more tears for that, hardly. You two didn't have the pressure to be successful. Y'all were already doing well, and I know we talked about this at the barbecue, but I just never got the feeling that she ever really approved of me. Yeah, yeah, I remember hearing you say that. Remember drivin' home and I was thinkin' about... What that would look like, a parent who doesn't approve of their child, but... I mean, she never acted like to you. So I don't know where that comes from. I mean, Jeff and I started so quick, and she was there to help with the boys and everything, but she didn't come to half the birthday parties that she did for Crystal. Oh, don't, I mean, y'all live out here. Well, I woulda gone and picked her up. We built that room for her at the top of the stairs, and she only used it but the one time. She gave you Mawmaw's earrings, and you can't even wear 'em. I don't know. You got money? What? Oh, yeah, no, that's... Go on with what you were sayin'. I can't do this right now. I got this stupid meeting in an hour, and I gotta get ready for it. I'm gonna get all worked up. I've caught you at a bad time. No, uh, stay and we'll have dinner later, and I just got a bunch of breakfast stuff for tomorrow. It's fine. I just wanted to see you and let you know how I was doin'. Jimmy, stay! You wouldn't have driven all the way out here if you weren't gonna stay. You woulda called. That's all right, I'll call next time. Jimmy, don't be difficult. That's my middle name, isn't it? Let's do that phone call sometime soon. I'm lookin' forward to it. Yeah, that'd be nice. You want a to go cup? Hey, Mom, this is stupid. So, yeah, so I lost Crystal, and I don't know what to do, and I wish you were here to tell me. Sometimes I'm actually glad you're not 'cause you'd be ashamed of me. I get it. I guess I'm lucky. But I did everything that I could, and I had to sell the dance academy to pay for the lawyers, and I lost, I'm sorry. I wish I could go back. I'd a done it different, I'd a listened to ya. Your headstone looks beautiful, by the way. A lot of these are pretty tacky yeah. Yours is nice; it just says "Mother" on it. I thought it was gonna be spooky out here. It's not bad. I'll come back. Hate to think you're lonely. Anyway. If you're tryin' to help me, you don't have to anymore. Help Morgan if you can. What's goin' on? I'm sober! Hey, it's me! I'm sober! I'm sober, what's goin' on? Pick up your phone. What? Your phone! Pick up your phone. What's goin' on? I've been drinkin'. They're tryin' to call you. I'm locked, I'm locked out. I locked myself out of my car, I guess. What's goin' on? I don't... They just sent me to... Oh, you don't know! - Fuckin' find out! - OK. Why would you pull me over if you don't know! - OK, I call it... - What's goin' on? - Why do they need me? - I'll call it in! Goddamn! Is my house? What's your name again, Doug? Fuck, Doug! Goddamn! Goddamn! Ow! Ow! Ow! Fuck! You got a stick? Hey! You got a stick? Yep. How do I, how do I, all right. Does it have a little coop on it? Goddamn it. Fuck me. It's dead, it's dead. The battery life on these fuckin' things. 270 Winthrop? That's my wife's house, 270? That's my wife's house. What happened? What happened? - She's fine. - What happened? Honey, what happened? She's just fine, she's OK. What happened? Are you OK? What happened? What happened? She have to see any of that? She's the one that called it in. You did great, honey. You did great, honey, you did so good. Go with Uncle Nate. You gotta go with Uncle Nate, honey. I'm sorry, but you coulda called me. You coulda called me, honey. It's OK. Why didn't she call me? Yeah. Sad. I will never forgive you for this. I've hated your for a long time, but it was nothin' like this. You were a wonderful mother, and you were so beautiful, and you let everything get in the way. So... This is from me and Crystal. And this is from Crystal's future husband and my mom. You good? I'm good. She's in the bus right now with Sharon. I got someone headed to pick up your car. You got keys? Uh, here. Captain's on the phone right now with CPS about your character. I think you got her. They're calling it non-pursuable jurisdiction. Oh, we've got people lookin' for Chris. Yeah, find him; you don't want me to. It's fine, it's fine. It's fine, it's OK. It's just the neighborhood. Hey, honey. Yeah, come over here, it's fine. It's fine, honey. She wouldn't wake up. I know, honey, I'm so sorry. Let me talk to you for a second. I gotta talk to you about somethin' important. You gotta listen for a second. Did Mom ever talk to you about Grandma? No. Yeah. Well, look. Just because somebody leaves, just because somebody chooses to leave, that doesn't mean they didn't wanna be here with you. It means they had a hard time of things. A lot for some people. That's not gonna be us. And you and I are gonna have a hard time for a long while. Might even have to go and talk to some people, but before you know it, everything will be back to normal. And I'm gonna be the best dad ever, you understand? I gotta get you out a here. It's a dead end living here. Move to a city. Pack up the house and go tonight if we have to. Oh God, it's the song. Sorry, honey. Daddy's realizing he's had this conversation before. I was about your age. How'd she say it? I can't make you leave. You gotta want more for yourself. I can't promise you it's not gonna get much better living here. What do you say? You wanna hop in the car with me? You wanna runaway together? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, OK. All right. All right, I'm gonna take you home. Actually, I can't take you home. Hold on, wait for a second. Hey, Nate! My house. Yeah, what? My house. Yeah, yeah, I'm on it. I'm... I'm on it. This is gonna be so lame. No it's not, honey, you're gonna love it. Put your shawl on. Why do I have to wear a shawl? 'Cause that's what girls do when they go to the ballet. Don't complain; stop being a little Grinch. Gimme that. Oh, my god!
