(dramatic music) - Jeremy. What you doing here, boy? This ain't no place to play. Jeremy, these fields are crawling with yanks. It's dangerous. Now, listen, Jeremy, now that your daddy's gone, you gotta take care of your mama, you understand? Now listen, I want you to go home and you go straight home. You take Hopkins Road, the long way, and you stay out of that holler, 'cause it's been mined. We put those mines there to kill yanks, keep them out of our land, not to kill little boys, you understand? - Yes, sir. - You gotta take care of yourself, too, Jeremy, 'cause you're special. We've all seen that. God has smiled on you, boy. I want you to go straight home, you hear me? Now go on. (dramatic music) - [Soldier] Halt. (dramatic music) - Let me go. - It's just a boy. What should we do? - Take him back. We'll let the captain decide. (dramatic music) - Your landmines have cost me three men and a great deal of time. Since you planted them, you will remove them. (suspenseful music) On my command, you will march across the field. If you make it across, you may continue on unharmed. Those who refuse my order will be shot. - Not the boy for God's sake. Let him go. - He's wearing a uniform, isn't he? Then he's a soldier. Now, march. (suspenseful music) - Jeremy, you believe in God, don't you? So do I, Jeremy. So we're gonna be all right, aren't we? You got nothing to be afraid of. (suspenseful music) - Ready. (suspenseful music) Aim. (suspenseful music) (explosion) (suspenseful music) (explosion) (suspenseful music) (explosions) (suspenseful music) Soldier. (suspenseful music) Again. (suspenseful music) (rock music) ♫ I said uptown in Brooklyn ♫ Listen up, my mind ♫ Crawling mama, this is mama ♫ Need to taste your wine ♫ Said why (birds chirping) - Banging on that sucker ain't gonna make it work, man, huh? - But that was a great tune. - Well, you know, that's the law of sound transmission. It's the lousy stuff that always gets better reception than the good stuff. That's how it works. See that's why you could always catch that gospel shit in the middle of nowhere. Don't really matter where you are, you know what I mean? Throw me that mallet, would you? - I got your mallet. - [Man] Oh good. Bout to throw it. (suspenseful music) - Going home, going on patrol. Sound off, one, two. Sound off, three, four. Hup two three four down. Three four. (birds chirping)` - Hey what time you got, man, it's getting late? - My watch stopped. (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) - Help me. Help me. Grab my arm, grab it. (screaming) (dramatic music) - All right, you're on. - I'm in. - I'll match. Dennis, man, you tweet? - Yeah, I want a part of that. You make it back to the truck and we'll see. - Whoa, man, I love it. - You're nuts. - [Man] Come on, who else? Who else, ante up? - I'm in. - What about you? - I got 60. - That's 80. - How bout it, Weir? - I don't like this, guys. Ellis, Ellis is gonna get hurt. You're gonna get lost or something, and then we're all gonna be in trouble. - [Man] Oh, come on. - Yeah, right, Weird. - Easy. - All right, 100. - Bets are in. - Be right back. (dramatic music) - [Man] Hold the rail, dude. (dramatic music) - Never seen a white boy run like that. (dramatic music) - Oh. - Adios, bucko. - All right, make him stop the truck. - No way. (dramatic music) - Look at that. - He did it, man. Fucking incredible. (dramatic music) Come on, that's it. (dramatic music) Hey, all right. - [Man] Hey, flash, what happened to you back there? - Picked up a souvenir. - You stopped for a prehistoric bullet. - What's the big deal? I find those all over where I grew up. - [Man] Where did you grow up, Bucky? - Detroit. (laughing) - Remember Alabama. - [Group] Ooh. - Nice run, Ellis. Come on, dude, double or nothing? (laughing) - Okay, Compton, time to babysit the greenhorns. Catch you in three days. - That's right. - Okay, see you on Friday. Fall in. Attention. Okay, now listen up, you cub scouts are gonna be simulating full tactical maneuvers. - I feel like a fucking girl scout. - You're holding live ammo, that means no bullshit. You may even get your tails wet. What's the matter, Private Ellis? You sweating awful hard. - Humidity, sir. - Humidity, huh? Or because you're chasing that truck back there like somebody's half wit dog? Fall out. - Doesn't make a whole lot of sense hauling firewood in the forest, sir. - You haven't been in the army long enough, private. - You think singling me out should work, sir. - Why, no, Ellis, just matching up our recruits with their special skills, just like we promised on TV. (birds chirping) - What about that Hopkins man? She got eyes in the back of her head or what? - I don't know, man. What a burn. I joined the army to party in Europe. Who needs this crap? - Ain't that a bitch. - Okay, look alive. If any of you ever seen a tornado, you know what the stillness and stink of the air means, but we won't let that stop us. - What are we, postmen? - Chris, I think I'm getting a blister. (wind blowing) - What the hell are we doing out here anyway, man? - I don't know. I guess this is what they call military recon maneuvers. - Oh yeah? - Something like that. - I call it walking around like a dick with ears for a week, coming back with nothing but chiggers and a hard on. Where the hell are we? - Yeah, Hopkins is right. We're right before a tornado, man. - No, man. This is earthquake weather. - Earthquake weather, shit. This is twister country. - I don't know. One time in Melbourne the weather was like this, we had an earthquake. This massive trembler. Cracked my old man's jacuzzi. It flooded the whole living room for a week. - Wow, man, that's bitching. - You know they successfully crossed a pig and a human being? No, this is true, absolutely true, in South Dakota somewhere, they took this pig's head and they put it on this body of a human, by stitching I guess, or something, but the point is, Chris, I read this in a classified document. - What are you doing reading classified documents? - Well, I heard about it, but the point is Chris, this kind of stuff happens all the time. This stuff goes on and people, we just don't, ow. - You're right, you're right, I'm sorry. (dramatic music) - What do you think my chances of getting laid on this trip are? - I don't know, why don't you ask Lejune? Hey, Lejune. What are my chances of getting laid on this trip? Oh, that good, huh? - [Man] Same as your chances anywhere, buddy. - Yeah? How's Rosy Palm doing, sweetheart? (dramatic music) - Okay, on your feet. All in. Let's haul ass. (wind blowing) - [Soldier 1] Uh oh, hey guys I think it's gonna rain. - [Soldier 2] Yeah, look at those clouds, I think you're right. You should be a meteorologist. - Actually, Chris, I heard information that the CIA altered the ozone layer in Russia and caused it to rain in certain parts of the desert, and this is the truth. It caused a drought in certain parts of the formula. - Well, then it must have been the Ruskies raining out the Dodger game last Sunday. Now we're even, Weir. - Real intelligent, Sedge. (dramatic music) - Oh man, whoa. Wild strange pelt on the hook, man. (howls) Hey, baby. Hey, where you going? - What the hell are you two doing? Less fantasizing and more walking. Move it, Court. I told you you'd get to love that log, Ellis. (birds chirping) (soldiers chattering) - Hey, Lejune? - What? - You ever do it in a pine forest on a nice soft ped of needles. - Why don't you grow up, Cort, huh? Shit. - Imagine walking through here at night. (speaking foreign language) - Show what? - Yeah, it goes back to the Napoleonic Wars. - What are they for? - Well, the Confederates used it to keep out advancing Union troops. It's very effective. - [Man] Christ, how did you know that? - I don't know, I guess I read it somewhere. - Hey, maybe we're getting close to some hill Billy still or something. Sergeant, I thought they scoped this area out? Not supposed to be anybody around? - There's not, but there's somebody around here now. They're not exactly rolling out the welcome mat. Okay, let's keep rolling. And be alert. (dramatic music) - Some psycho around here likes to whittle? (suspenseful music) - Stop. What did this? - Looks like a giant egg yolk or something. Look at that color. - Looks like there's iron in the soil or something. - A UFO obviously landed here. - Check this out. Alien surface. - Beings from an advanced world quite unlike our own landed here on earth, shat and left. (laughing) - There's nothing growing here at all. - Lunar, man. - Think this was ome kind of chemical dump site? - No, not here. Brush fire did this. Okay, listen up. We're gonna get busy setting up operations as instructed. Weir? - Yes, sir. - [Woman] I want communications operational and I want it on the double. Got it? - Yes, sir. (suspenseful music) (speaking indistinctly) - [Woman] Evan, Evan. - Okay, fall out. We set up operations here. - Not here. - Are you commanding this outfit, private? I wasn't informed. (birds chirping) (wind blowing) - Hey, egg man. I think I just might get laid on this trip after all. - Oh, yeah? What gives you that idea. - Did you catch that wild broad back there, man? - Oh, yeah, you saw her. - Ooh, I know she's just aching for it. - Your dick's hallucinating. - No, man. I know she's out there. Hey, baby, all this is for you. I know she's out there on her back, legs in the air. Oh, baby. Oh! (dramatic music) - What, what? Court? (dramatic music) Hey, yo guys, come here. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah. Just get me out of here, huh? - What happened? - He fell in. - Court, you okay? - [Man] Yeah, get me out of here. - I bet it's some kind of trap. Like for bears, man. - Okay, flash. Get him the hell out of there. - Flash, you're up, man. - Yeah, baby. - No, it wasn't meant to be a trap. It's built to stay up. - Take a nap, good buddy. - Oh, yeah, just get me out of here. Give me your hand. - All right, here you go. - That's up. - Hand me your flashlight. - Coming in. Maybe it's part of the old underground railroad. (speaking indistinctly) (bird chattering) - [Man] Like some kind of... - [Woman] What did you say? - Looks like a bunker or something. (bird chattering) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Ellis? - [Man] Coming out. (birds chirping) - You see whiskey or anything like that down there, did you? - Okay, listen up. I want you to take this little experience as a lesson. We're in unfamiliar territory. We don't know what the hell we're dealing with. Oscar, you, Sedgewick, Court, scout the area for some more of these damn things. Lejune, help Weir with the radio. The rest of you set up cam, haul ass. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) I want every one of these guidelines tied down and secured, you got that? Okay, then, go and help Weir with that damn radio and I don't want any screwing around. Okay, go. (birds chattering) Mendez, what the hell are you doing? - It doesn't make sense. - What doesn't make sense? - The wind. - What the hell are you talking about? - It blows from here outward. (dramatic music) (birds chattering) (eerie music) - Private Ellis. Ellis. You can oblige us by digging the latrine, over there. (birds chattering) - [Man] Hey where did she come from-- - Shh. - I thought there was supposed to be nobody here. - Can I help you? Are you lost? I'm Sergeant Leona Hawkins. What's your name? - Melanie. - Melanie. Well, Melanie are you lost? - No, I live here. - Where? - Nearby. - Are there others? - [Melanie] Some. - Where are they? Tell me about them. - There's nothing much to tell. We're just quiet simple folk. - Latrine, 12. Shit hole. (birds chattering) Pays to be a bear. (birds chattering) (suspenseful music) - Whoa, check it out. - Take a look at this thing. - Hey. Is it anybody we know? - Hey, easy with it. - I wonder what happened to him. Are you kidding? Come on. - Hey, man, don't fuck with the dead. It's bad luck. - Everybody can use a little skull. - Maybe it's the cat who built that bunker. - Oh, man, come on Court. Show some respect will you. - Yeah, Court, how'd you like it if someone walked around with your head? - Now who's that sly dude behind them shades? - No, man, see now I know a cat. I used to know this cat who used to run around in graveyards and play with stones and shit and he's dead. This is bad luck, I'm telling you. Whoa. - What the? You motherfucker. (birds chattering) - Anybody care for a little brewskie? - You fucking infantile-- - What's that, bubba? - Easy, Oz, easy. It's not worth the ushering. - What's going on over here? Now who was shooting his damn weapon off? - I did, sir. I was having a problem with my firing pen, so I went a safe distance into the woods to check it out and everything seems fine now. - That's very commendable, but next time would you be so kind as to inform us first? - Oh, yes, sergeant, I will. - Mendez, shoot the fucker. (birds chattering) (dramatic music) - [Soldier 1] The thing is, Chris, you just can't find them in my town. - [Soldier 2] Awesome, you really can't? - [Soldier 1] Not at all, you gotta go somewhere like New York or something. - [Soldier 2] You got a dog leash with no dog. - [Soldier 1] Are you hungry, I got one of these popsicles for you. - No, not really. - Sleep deprivation. I have no idea. (speaking indistinctly) - Donna, Donna who? She really as blind? (laughing) (insects chirping) (laughing) What the hell? Somethings overcome you since we... (laughing) - Good work, Sedgewick. Tomorrow will graduate you to a straw. One step at a time. (laughing) - [Soldier 1] Thanks, God. - You gonna eat this? - No. (speaking indistinctly) - Grab name band? - Ellis, I just wanna say that I'm a different girl now then I was five months ago and I feel like it's a different situation now, all right? I feel really happy about the way things are now. I feel like I'm doing something. I like the idea of it. I like the idea of men and women working together side by side without automatically, you know what I mean? You think I'm full of shit don't you? - Private Ellis. Please be advised that you're pulling double shift guard duty tonight. That's 2200 to 0200. Should help you keep your mind on proper military conduct. That's in five minutes. - Well, pleasant dreams. (vocalizing) - Nighty night, sailor. (insects chirping) - Ain't no justice, just us. (insects chirping) (dramatic music) (animal growls) (suspenseful music) - Sedge. Listen. (suspenseful music) What the hell is that? (animal growls) (suspenseful music) - Thought he broke that hammock? Weird. That time, buddy, shake it off. (suspenseful music) (owl hoots) (suspenseful music) - [Woman] Ellis? - Hey. - Court? - Hey, Lejune, how you doing? I got something for you. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. All for you. - Thank you. - You know how hard it is. Thinking about you every night. - Not as hard as it is thinking about you, Court. - Yeah? You got beautiful eyes. Great body. Oh. - You really make me hot now. Please, really, I can't take it any longer. Put it in. What's the matter, you can't get it up, huh? Huh, Court? - I'll get your ass section 13'd for this, baby. - What, I can't hear you? - All I gotta do is tell Hockey you pulled a knife on me and poof. - Oh, really, well, listen, why don't you explain to her how you found yourself with your ass with a blade between your balls. Get out of here. (laughing) (groaning) (owls hoots) (insects chirping) - Say, hey. (suspenseful music) Fucking odd, man. All these things. (suspenseful music) Hi, hi man. Can I go? (suspenseful music) I don't know. (suspenseful music) Hey. (suspenseful music) Hey, man. Come here. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) - Okay, look alive, everybody up. Everybody up, let's move it. Let's get going. Pack your gear. We move out at 0600. (birds chirping) Where's Court? (birds chirping) Engle, where's Court? - Court? - He shares a tent with you, remember? Now where is he? - What? - Soldier, are you ill? - I'm fine. - Well, then, where the hell? Oh, shit. Go and sit down. - Oh, jeez. - Ellis, Weir. - Yes, sir. - You were on duty last night. - He couldn't have gone when I was duty, I didn't see him. - No, no, Court came into my tent while you were on duty, Weir. And then he left. - This is an embarrassment. Sedgewick, Osgood, you and Ellis go and find Court and I want him back here immediately. - [Together] Yes, sir. (birds chirping) - What are you gawking at, soldier? Move it. (birds chirping) - God damn strange. Where could he have gone? - I don't know, where would you go if you were dealing with a prick? - Call Ellis. - Thanks. (birds chirping) (laughing) Hey. Take turn. (suspenseful music) - Uh oh. (suspenseful music) Shit. (suspenseful music) (thunder rumbles) (suspenseful music) - No justifiable way. No justifiable way this could happen. I've got one dead soldier because you're too careless, too apathetic, or too drunk. I oughta put you all on report, but I need to get to the bottom of this because this is my ass on the line. The three of you, you go with me. Get your weapons and load live rounds. We leave in 20 minutes. Weir. - Yes, sir. - You will contact base on that radio. I don't care if you have to shimmy your ass up the tallest tree to get a signal off, do you hear me? - Yes, sir. - The rest of you stay put. We rendez-vous at 1500 and I want transport notified and standing by at that time. - Yes, sir. (birds chirping) (dramatic music) - Came through here yesterday. These weren't here. - Are you sure? - [Man] Positive. - Let's keep on moving. (dramatic music) - It doesn't seem like anybody lives here. Looks like a storage bin or something. - Yeah. - Is it worth it? - Let's find out. (dramatic music) Lejune. (dramatic music) - There's nothing in here but junk, let's get out of here. - Let's check and see if anybody's been here first. (dramatic music) - Hey, sergeant. Looks like a diary. - 1865. Court was killed last night. - Sergeant, look at this rifle. - It's a relic. - Evan left this morning. He has gone to fight the Yankee advance from the north. Lejune listen to this. I will not shed tears, separation of war, it is all so futile, 11th of March. No word from Evan. Yesterday, our son put on Evan's uniform and carried a stick like a rifle. I scolded him. Dear God, don't let Jeremy taste the awful poison of this war. March 16, a fortnight has passed since I have last heard from Evan. I pray all is well and my love quickly returns to me. (dramatic music) Oh, wait. The news of Evan's death arrived yesterday. Were it not for Jeremy, I would end my life, too. He is everything now. - Somebody else is in here. (suspenseful music) - [Man] It's scary. (suspenseful music) - We don't mean to frighten you. We're the 44th division field training corp. We're from Fort Benny. Look, one of our recruits was killed last night. Can you understand what I'm saying? (suspenseful music) - [Man] We don't mean to hurt you. (gasps) (suspenseful music) - Melanie, right? - Yes. - Do you know the old man? - [Melanie] Yes. - Is he family? Where were you last night? I want some answers. If I don't get any, I'll be forced to take you into custody. - She's a civilian, sir, we can't. - I have the authority to investigate the murder of someone I'm responsible for. Any attempt to undermine that authority is insubordination, do I make myself clear, soldier? - Crystal, sir. - Now, Private Ellis, you and Mendez escort this lady back to camp. - What about the old man, sir? - He's not going anywhere. Move out. (dramatic music) Now tell me you don't know anything about this. (birds chirping) We can stand here all night. I haven't got any plans. (birds chirping) Talk to me. (birds chirping) (suspenseful music) Have we made contact with base yet? - I don't think so, sir. - Where's Weir and the radio? (birds chirping) - It's okay, I've almost got it. - Get him the hell down from there. God damn Christmas tree ornament. - [Man] Hey, Weir, come on down. Forget it. - Can't we just go back the way we came? - It'll take two, two and a half days to backtrack on foot. How far'd you say Sheffield is? - About 15, 18 miles north, north east. - Okay, we head for Sheffield. It's open terrain, flat. It'll take us about six or eight hours. If we manage to make radio contact, we might be able to rendez-vous elsewhere. - [Man] I don't think so, sir. For some reason, our transmissions aren't getting through. - [Woman] Weir, are you sure you checked the radio clearly, there's nothing malfunctioning? - [Man] Nothing that I can find. - I don't understand a damn thing. It must be a grid lock. Interference or something. (dramatic music) Private Ellis, would you kindly grace us with your presence? (dramatic music) Thank you. Now we double our watch tonight. We leave at first light. (insects chirping) - Dammit, Weir, have you tried every available frequency? Do something. - I've tried everything. Maybe it's the weather, or something like that. You know, I heard about-- - You all right, Lejune? - It's nothing, just forget about. - Why, is it Ellis? - I said forget about it, all right? - It's forgot. Wasn't really any of my business, anyway. - I'm sorry. I'm really glad you're here. You always seem to know what's happening. Chris. - Yeah? - What is happening? - I don't know. (screams) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (dramatic music) - We gotta get out of here. - Get down. - Weir. Get up, dammit. Oh God. - Guys, guys. (dramatic music) - You're right on time. (dramatic music) (screaming) All right, on my count. Oh, shit. (dramatic music) (screaming) - I can't see anything. (guns firing) (dramatic music) - Come on in. (dramatic music) - [Woman] It's backwards. (dramatic music) - [Man] They stopped. - Stay down, dammit. - Just stay where you are. Nobody move. Who saw you? Anybody? - We gotta get out of here. (dramatic music) - I don't know. - Should have put out the goddamn fire. (insects chirping) - Shit. - Lie still, lie still. Lie still, all right? - The fuck is out there? Shit. - Sedge, Sedge, my belt's over at the tent. I gotta go get it. I'll be right back. - Okay, hurry. - Just be cool, all right. (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) - I'm all right. Check on the others. (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) Who's out there? Who's out there? You're fucking with the wrong person. (suspenseful music) - Ellis. You watch out for her. (suspenseful music) - This is fucking crazy. Why don't they just come out? Oz, Oz! Oz, get over here. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (guns firing) (dramatic music) Oz? Oh God. - Sedge. - Jerk. - Oh, God, what happened? - I don't know. - It had a weapon. - Who? - What the hell did you think you were shooting at, soldier? - Come on, Oz. You understand. Oz. - Sedgewick. - No! - No! - Ellis, Ellis. - Just stay put. That's an order. - Hey, Ellis can catch him. Let him go. - Double or nothing. (dramatic music) (grunts) (dramatic music) (screams) (suspenseful music) (insects chirping) (suspenseful music) - Can't move. (insects chirping) Ellis, why can't I move? Oh God. Oh God. Help me. (insects chirping) (dramatic music) (insects chirping) - Get it, man. (insects chirping) - We haven't heard any gunshots in a while. That's good, isn't it, Chris? That's a good sign. Sedge, Ellis, they got away. Maybe they just kept going. (insects chirping) - Tighter. Yeah, that's it. - They kept going, why don't we do the same. - We stay put. (insects chirping) It's suicide out there. (insects chirping) We try to get out of here at first light and see what the hell we're up against. Until then, let them make the next move. (suspenseful music) - Sergeant. (suspenseful music) - Holy shit. (suspenseful music) - I didn't know fog could look like this. (suspenseful music) - What is that? - That's fog. - Looks like fog. - What's that supposed to mean? This is fog. This is not fog. (suspenseful music) - No way. (suspenseful music) Sergeant. (suspenseful music) Sergeant, she's gone. (suspenseful music) - Got us by the shorts now. (dramatic music) - Evan. (dramatic music) - It's you. You're making this happen. Why? Why? (dramatic music) - Jeremy. (dramatic music) Jeremy. (dramatic music) - [Man] Soldier. (dramatic music) Again. (dramatic music) - Jeremy. Jeremy, oh my God, no, Jeremy. (explosion) (dramatic music) - It's not possible. Who are you? (insects chirping) That old man? - He's my son. And yours. - What are you talking about? - Come with me, Evan. - Evan? (insects chirping) - You promised. Love eternal. (dramatic music) - It's not me. It's not me. (suspenseful music) (screaming) (suspenseful music) - They're moving in behind the fog. - Where? Where? I don't see anything. - Stay down. By the time you see them, it'll be too late. (wind blowing) (insects chirping) - Chris, where are you going? Chris, don't go out there. (dramatic music) Chris. (groaning) (dramatic music) (screaming) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Weir, Chris, what happened? (dramatic music) - I'm not your enemy. (dramatic music) Don't be afraid. (dramatic music) Look at me. You gotta help me. Listen to me. (dramatic music) - Get away from him. (suspenseful music) (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Move away. - Look at me, look at me. The suffering, you can end it. (suspenseful music) - Move away. (gun fires) (suspenseful music) - Jeremy, end it. Send her back. - No. No. (suspenseful music) Jeremy. - It's over. - Jeremy. Jeremy. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, Jeremy. (screaming) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Love eternal. (dramatic music) - [Lejune] Oh. Ellis, it just stopped. (dramatic music) - Ellis. Private Ellis. (dramatic music) So what does a body have to do to get a little help around here. (dramatic music) Oh. - You all right? - Okay, soldiers. Let's haul ass out of here. (sweeping music) ♫ Another chance to live again ♫ Another story told ♫ I reach inside and live again ♫ And watch the world grow old ♫ I've always known its time would come ♫ The secret locked away ♫ The shadows dance, a memory ♫ The measure of each day ♫ I hear the voices ♫ The call ♫ From a place where the night ♫ Never falls ♫ One moment is frozen in time ♫ And forever, your love will be mine ♫ The morning sun will live again ♫ I see it in your eyes ♫ And yesterday is just a dream ♫ That's written in the skies (dramatic music) (cheerful music)
