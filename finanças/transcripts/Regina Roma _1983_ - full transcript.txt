Oh, it's so dirty out there, I was a fool to ever let him go. Papa, watch out for the wine, are you trying to break it? (Papa laughing) Filthy garbage bin. - I told you not to touch that, I was gonna fix it.

Oh, he must have missed his train, otherwise he'd be here. Look at that rain. Oh, and he's so fragile, so fragile. Ever since he was a child, he's been so delicate, so prone to illnesses. - A baby that weighed 10 and a half pounds when he was born, he was almost abnormal, he was so fat. - You're telling me, it wasn't you was ripped apart when he was born. I almost lost my life, he was such a big child. Oh, Papa, why did he have to grow up? - He had to become a man. - Are you a man? (jazz instrumental music) Got to lay in bed, Papa. (Papa sighs) - You know sometimes I feel that you've got something against me. (feet thumps) (knife scraping on the board) - Well, don't slice too much. Once it's sliced it'll dry out. No point in wasting it. We're doing without enough things as it is. - [Papa] For instance? - The little niceties in life - Are you hinting about that car again? What the hell would we do with a car? You know I failed my driving test. - Five times. I couldn't look the neighbors in the eye. - You think I didn't wanna pass? First, I couldn't afford a car. When I saved a little money they wouldn't give me my license. - Oh, why didn't you open the wine. (Mama sighs) It's so dark out there.

How many times I stood at this window and I looked out, at what, nothing. When all the people were driving away in a nice cars and waving and smiling, we like a couple of dummies motored down, like a couple of nules for miles and miles to catch and old bus, that wasn't eve on time. Oh, God, just like poor folk. - Mama we were rich. - Well, whose fault was it. - It was because of the depression. (suspense music) - I could have Had a life like Lena's. - Tell me what the hell does Lena have that you don't? - A rich husband, and she has a maid, and she goes to the beauty parlor. She travels, I mean, in the winter time they go down to Orlando and stay in this palace. - Tell me, can you see yourself staying at a palace in Orlando? - I sure could. - Mama, the place where she's goes is full of old people they ain't gonna find their rent, they will come and collect phones. You know their main distraction is comparing their varicose veins. They're all alone and bought a desk. Nobody likes him. And they like nobody. And they expect money, and you know what Mama? You want to know something now, ah? They are without love. - But they are rich. - Well Mama then, you shouldn't have met me, (indistinct) just as awful. It's shocking. - Shocking.

One for each month you were away. Carry? Yeah, to your return. Look at me. Now really look at me. We don't want any more misunderstanding too. - No mother. - You're not upset tonight? - No. - You're sure? - I'm sure. - You swear it? - I swear. - And if you're still mad at me I couldn't survive. Carry? - Hmm. - Kiss me. You never left me before, did you? - Mama? (laughs) - We've always lived together just the three of us. We devoted an entire life to his education. We wanted him to do better than we did. We sacrificed everything for it. - I didn't ask for anything, Mama. - Oh, I didn't mean that. Honey, I have no regrets. It's that I don't understand. With your father's education, you could have done far better. My husband never mentioned it but he's got a stack of diploma. And it's quite a responsibility. He's in charge of all those parking lots. - Mama one lousy parking Ilana crumby (laughs). I'm just one of the attendants. - Are you drunk? - In a four-by-four booth and I see a bunch of tickets. A bunch tickets with this all day long (laughs). Oh, yes, sometimes I make changes. - He doesn't drink very much. No drink (indistinct) I suppose you're not gonna tell us that you didn't finish high school. - Well, like everybody else. - Too petty. Back then you had so many chances, so many contexts. (indistinct) What makes you money? What about Leo Graham? - I didn't know him. What? But he is a girl with your child that you played together Little Mitchelle. - Oh my God, you're right I was four-years-old. I had a fight with a little girl on this public park and about a pain and a shovel and the news broke it up and she told the nurse told my mother that the child was related to Leo Graham. I never saw a little girl again. - It would make a liar of me. You think we were half cast. We know nobody, we've never had any friends. - Mama we didn't have any friends. - Well, what about the bikini, the bone gay, the Bradley's. I mean, they were all our friends, rich, brilliant. They invited us everywhere, do you remember all the lovely parties? (laughs) - Sure mama, all because I did him a favor at the City Hall. You're right, you're right. There is the bikini didn't write as one and only once. And that was to a funeral of the niece. I don't think we went, did we? - No, problem, but we couldn't. Baby you had chickenpox and they couldn't leave him. You dispatch yourself like a dog would have been. (laughs) Do you know I didn't want you to have birth marks. So I tied my hands to yours so I could suffer with you. You were such a difficult child. No approach though (sighs). And I think that the patience I had with myself just to teach you the first word mama, mama, mama. - That's why he didn't say Papa until he was 2 1/2. - Three. Your lungs was so delicate. I had to put you into my bed every night, I hold you close me just to keep you warm. - I wasn't allowed to come into your room for months, for months I slept on that damn coach all along. - [Mama] Papa had to bail all alone. - I was asking for my sister come between you once in a while. Was I asking too much. - Would you take my body from him. - I know how to sleep with my wife. I mean, men get married to sleep with their wives. - Why didn't you tell my father when you are (indistinct) - Because you were pregnant. - I guess that's when I was on the way, huh? (dramatic music) - No, the other one. - Papa. - What other one? Mama what are you two talking about? Was there another child or what? - That child as I know would be four years older than him. It was stillborn. - Mama this is true? - The birth is recorded to the County. - Papa, that's enough. - Baby was baptized in the name of Carry. (somber music) She was a girl. Mama we promised ourselves the story we would tell him and I think the time has come. I'm gonna get some coffee. - Papa. - Your father is sick. Carry he is really sick. - What are you talking about Mama? - Carry I've been trying to get him to doctor. - Mama tell me the truth. What was he talking about, Mama? Was he telling the truth? Yes or no Mama? Tell me. Mama, was there anybody in this house named Carry besides me? Tell me Mama. - She didn't live. - So Papa told the truth? - Being named Carry just long enough to come out of the womb and go into a casket. Does that really count? - Mama listen to me, was her name Carry, yes or no, Mama? - Yeah. - Tell me. - Carry yes. Yes, that was her name. Thank you Mama. Come on Regina. - What have I done to you? - Mama, Regina and I gonna get married in a month on the 15th in Baton Rouge and I don't want you to come. - You're judging us without knowing the facts. - I know it Mama. - You'll listen to me anyhow. - Why? - Because your father is jealous of his own son. - What the hell are you telling the boy for jealous. - Yes, jealous, jealous. Jealous fro that moment he was born you've been jealous, and you forced yourself on me, I didn't know anything I was innocent. You lie, you bragged enough about not being a virgin. - Don't make me feel guilty about that murder. - What do you mean murder? - Who are you to decide what's a murder? I was alone, alone. Fighting, desperate, shame. Yeah I took some pills. I did everything I could do, anything to get rid of that illegitimate thing that was inside me. - You succeeded my Carry, my Carry died. - If I have the same need to do again, I would do it exactly the same. - Oh God, oh God. - What about me? Where do I fit to all these? I'm like the feeling that I'm taking somebody else's place. - Oh no my baby, no, no. I wanted you with all my strength, with every fiber of my body with my eyes, with my blood. - Can you do that? Carry, Carry I wanted you, I wanted you long before I knew you could exist. I loved you long before you were conceived. I used to pray for you night after night. Night I wake up with eyes wide open in the dark and imagine the warm of your flesh. Is your cry, your smile. Oh, I used to talk to Carry. And I waited and waited for you months after months and when the moment you came and I hold you in my arms. Nothing is started, but you nothing. (dramatic music) - Excuse me. Excuse me I'm going to bed. - Tell me before you go anywhere, in front of your son, have you anything at all against me? - No. - And you and the presence of your father? - No. - Nothing. - Nothing. - Have I been a perfect mother to you? - Yes. - Hey, well then, good night Papa. - Good night. - Papa, aren't you sleeping in your room? - (mumbles) Today comfortable. - It's a nice place to sleep. You can share my room with me. - No, thank you, Mama. - It's your father just giving you his place? - No. - Carry, be nice. (gentle music) - Papa I play, you have to get up with it anymore. Don't forget to put out the lights. Don't make any noise in the morning, you might wake the child. Papa, aren't you going to say good night to me? - Oh, goodnight. - Goodnight who? - Goodnight Mama. - Goodnight Papa. - Papa? - Yes. - Sleep well. - You too. - Papa? - Yes. - Nothing. Good night Papa. (gentle music) (door bangs) You're ready? - Well, where are you going? - I can't sleep here I have to go somewhere else Mama. - There's no need I'll make room for you. - No Mama, that's- - Oh, no. If anything I cannot bear (mumbles). - Mama. (upbeat music) Mama. Mama we got enough problem for one evening. - Go tell your father. - Mama. - You don't know me. - Mama, would you just listen to me for a second? - You don't know me. I know, I'm a nuisance. I'm in the way, but I'm getting out you'll be (indistinct). Maybe won't take me long to park, I have nothing. - Mama. - Oh, nothing, no. Everything I carry, always I carry. Before anything in your first communion, I have nothing, I owe nothing. I owe you my house, and I'm living it to you. Take your hands off me, I'm ashamed of you, I've paid your mortgage, all paid off and (indistinct) humiliation. And to you, I'm leaving everything in perfect working order, the pasta bands, the dishes, the whole ball of wax. You'll find the cleanses under the sink and the canned goods, the beverages in the pantry and if you look for a barbecue because there isn't one. - Why are you doing all these? Why are you packing and it's stupid Mama? I mean nobody's asking you to go any place, this is ridiculous, please. - Somebody's going to replace me. - Nobody is going- - No, I'm living. - Mama, nobody's going to replace you stop putting- - Take your hands off me. My little treasure, stop it. They're mine, they are my park. They're my park, and I'm leaving now.
