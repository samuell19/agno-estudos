Try and sort of sing it. OK, one... Middle eight then. 1, 2, 3, 4... All these years I've been wandering around Wonderin' why how come nobody told me All that I been lookin' for was somebody Who looked like you. Oh! Good morning! I've got a feeling, that keeps me on my toes Oh yeah, Oh yeah I've got a feeling, I think that everybody knows Oh yeah, Oh yeah Oh yeah, yeah, yeah I've got a feeling, yeah Ev'rybody had a hard year Ev'rybody had a good time Ev'rybody had a wet dream Everybody saw the sunshine Oh yeah yeah I've got a feeling! Queen says no to pot-smoking FBI members. Oh, Darling! Please, believe me! Yes, lovely. It's great. That could be a blast from the past. - What was the one from the other night? - That was "One after 909". Oh yeah, that was fantastic. - That's great. - Really great. 'Cause I really haven't thought of that. It's one of the first songs we ever done. Right. John wrote it when he was fifteen or something. It's just we all used to sag off every school day, you know. Go back to my house and the two of us would sit and write. "Love Me Do" "Too Bad About Sorrows" There's about 100 songs from then that we never reckoned, 'cause they were all very unsophisticated songs. "They said our love was just fun "The day that our friendship begun "There's no blue moon that I can see "There's never been in history." But we thought "that's too much..." It's great. And that one... We always hated the words of "The One after 909." "Baby said She's travelling on the one after 909 "She said move over honey, I'm travelling on that line "I said move over once Move over twice "Come on baby, don't be cold as ice. Move over once, Move over twice. C'mon baby, don't be cold as ice, Said she's travellin' on one after 909 Well I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee Said you're only fooling around, only fooling around with me Railman said: you got the wrong location. I got my bag, run right home Then I find, I've got the number wrong Move over once, Move over twice. C'mon baby, don't be cold as ice, Said she's travellin' on one after 90... Said she's travellin' on one after 90... Said she's travellin' on one after 909 - Morning, Paul - Good morning, Rich. - How are you this morning? - OK! Well, I bought the piano the other day I didn't know what songs to play I had to play the older theme Oh! baby... Well, that's me finished. - What's the bridge? B flat? - No, I changed it. OK, do it again, then. 1, 2, 3, 4 - Get on the mike. - OK. You know, 'cause I can't hear you. You don't have to bitch about it, we'll never get through it. We've just gone 'round for an hour with nothing in our heads. - Just the riffs. - No, there's no riffs. - I just don't get what you're playing. - No, but it's "You and I" "You and I are memories..." But it's not sounding together. Even on... - So we can only play until... - Or we can stop and say it's not together. If we had a tape recorder, just tape down, play it back, you'd throw that out. It's complicated now. See, if we can get it simpler, and then complicate it where it needs complications, but it's complicated in the bit... - It's not complicated. I mean, you know... I'll play just the chords, if you'd like... No, come on, George... You always get annoyed when I say that. I'm trying to help you, but I always hear myself annoying you. - No, you're not annoying me - I can't say... You know what I mean. - Because it'll take even longer... - Look, I'm not trying to say that. You're doing this again, as though I'm trying to say that. And what we said the other day, I'm not trying to get you. What I really am trying to say is, "Look, lads. "The band! "Should we try it like this?" It's funny that how I don't encourage when you put the... If this one is like, "Should we play guitar all through Hey Jude?" But I don't mind, I'll play whatever you want me to play. Or I won't play at all, if you don't want me to play. Whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it. We could start hearing the tapes now. Like do it and then hear what it is. Is it just 'cause we don't feel like it or is it "does the guitar sound alright?" Should we just try it? We'll just have less of those "Nothing's gonna change my..." Just have one each time, two at the end. Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, They call me on and on across the universe Put them down! Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Nothing's gonna change my world Ah-ha...

All thru' the day I Me Mine, I Me Mine, I Me Mine! All thru' the night I Me Mine, I Me Mine, I Me Mine! Now they're frightened of leaving it Ev'ryone's weaving it, Coming on strong all the time, All thru' the day I me mine. All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine. Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine. Ev'ryone's saying it, Flowing more freely than wine, All thru' the day I me mine. I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine, I-I-me-me mine, All I can hear I me mine, I me mine, I me mine. Even those tears I me mine, I me mine, I me mine. No-one's frightened of playing it Ev'ryone's saying it, Flowing like wine, All thru' your life... I me mine. Because you're sweet and lovely, I love you, Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true, I love you more than ever, girl, I do. I want you in the morning, girl, I love you, I want you at the moment I feel blue, I'm living ev'ry moment, girl, for you. Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you.

[JOHN] I just make it up as I go along. You know, a sort of bit with two. [JOHN] I met her on a Monday and her head stood still. - Oh, I saw that film last night. - What? Of us at the Maharishi's. I've got all the film, sort of together. Incredible. - I got a couple of reels of it at home? - It's just got a great opening. - The helicopter one up in the sky. - Yeah, I noticed you taking it. It's incredible. Just to see us. What we're doing. It's unbelievable. - What were you doing? - Yes, what were we doing? I don't really know, but it's like we totally put our own personalities under. We weren't really very truthful there. You know... These things like sneaking behind his back and saying "it's a bit like school, isn't it?". But you see on the film it is like school. And really we should've said... We wanna call... You wanna call it "What we did on our holidays". - Well, you know... - Just to sort of get it over with. There's a long shot of you walking with him. And it's just not you, you know. Sort of "Tell me old master" - Tell me old master. You know that... - And Linda remembered that thing you said. You went up in the helicopter with him. You thought he might slip you the answer. Besame Besame mucho A little kiss from you And I hear music divine Besame Besame mucho Love me forever and say that you'll always be mine!

Terrible. - No... - I think it was just the last one of them. - Oh yeah? - They are rough dubs, just remember. - They were rough. - I thought "Get Back" was the worst. - They can be sharpened up. - I left my guitar. - It was a great one. - I thought only "Get Back" was any good. And that wasn't great. Isadora Duncan worked the Telefunken.

You're gonna get it, all right! And you're gonna get it! Yeah, you're gonna get it This time you're gonna get it good! Yeah yeah yeah! That was "Can you dig it?" by Georgie Wood. Whenever we talk about it, we have certain rules. "What do you want to do?" And George says "no films". You know. But it's very wrong. Because you don't know. He says "Wait a minute." He means no Help! or A Hard Day's Night. And I agree. But like, "no films"? 'Cause this is a film. And now he doesn't mind this But it's that kind of thing, like "No TV shows". "No audience" When we came back from Hamburg and did Leicester du Montford Hall or whatever it was, Coventry. We played the ballroom and we had the worst first night then. We were all nervous, it was terrible. Then we played another, the next night and it got a little bit better. Next night, and then the next... Too much playing till... We got over that hang-up of the audience. It was like there was no one there. But there was a new sort of thing, and there was some fellow up front watching how you were playing, and we were right into it. And those would've been... If you could've recorded those things, they would've been the greatest. It's like Mal was saying "It's that bounce thing," you know. And we're good at that, once we get over the nervousness. But it's like the hurdle of that nervousness is there now. So the... You know... We can't get over it now, unless we really sort of go to the Albert Hall and get into a black bag. And the only other alternative to that is to say we will never do it to an audience again. But if we intend to keep any kind of contact on that scene... I do understand George saying "there's no point". It is like we're Stravinsky. And it's in the music. He doesn't get up and play his Joanna for them anymore. Two of us riding nowhere Spending someone's hard earned pay, You and me Sunday driving, Not arriving on our way back home. We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're going home. Two of us sending postcards Writing letters on my wall You and me burning matches, Lifting latches on our way back home We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're going home. You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead Two of us wearing raincoats Standing solo in the sun. You and me chasing paper, Getting nowhere on our way back home. We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're goin' home You and I have memories Longer than the road that stretches out ahead Two of us wearing raincoats Standing solo in the sun. You and me chasing paper, Getting nowhere on our way back home We're on our way home, We're on our way home, We're goin' home. Goodbye! We're on our way home. When I find myself in times of trouble Mother Mary comes to me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. And in my hour of darkness She is standing right in front of me Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be, let it be, Let it be, let it be! Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. And when the broken-hearted people Living in the world agree, There will be an answer, let it be. For though they may be parted There is still a chance that they will see There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be! There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be! Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be! There will be an answer, let it be. Let it be, Let it be, let it be, let it be! There will be an answer, let it be. And when the night is cloudy, There is still a light that shines on me, Shine until tomorrow, let it be. I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me, There will be no sorrow, let it be. Let it be, let it be, Let it be, let it be. There will be no sorrow, let it be. Let it be, let it be, Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. The long and winding road that leads to your door, Will never disappear, I've seen that road before It always leads me here, lead me to your door. The wild and windy night that the rain washed away, Has left a pool of tears crying for the day. Why leave me standing here, let me know the way. Many times I've been alone and many times I've cried, Anyway you've always known the many ways I've tried, But still they lead me back to the long winding road, You left me waiting here a long, long time ago. Don't keep me standing here, lead me to your door. But still they lead me back to the long winding road, You left me waiting here a long, long time ago. Don't leave me standing here lead me to your door! Where's the best way out of the way? Over here, I say. Help Maureen. Sit here. Mal! Nailed me down in the wrong place. You can get the clapper.

Yeah, I think it's great. Because, I mean... It brightens up the office hours. This type of music is alright, in its place it's quite enjoyable.
