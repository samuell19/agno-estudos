Oh, shit! Get 'em up, get 'em up! Move it, move it! Move it, move it, move it! Marine, what're you waiting for? No, please, don't! All right, move, move, move! All right, Mags, car is packed. Time for your mother and me to hit the road. Come on, dear, let's go. She can handle it, right, Mags? Love ya, kiddo. See you in a few days. Make sure the wolves don't kill each other, okay? Just another day in paradise. Don't worry, sir, we'll find him. Follow me. Yes, sir. Please, shut the door. Yes, sir. Hey look, Connor, I'm just gonna get right after it. I got a call this morning from Sarah Simmons over there on Ridge road. Sarah Simmons, Bobby's wife? Yeah, Bobby didn't come home last night. She's worried sick about him. Now, you know it takes about 24 hours for us to generate a missing person's report. I think with everything going on around here, I need for you to get out there ASAP if we have any chance of finding him alive. Yes, sir, me and Dave will get right on it. Hang on, there's more. I need you to take care of Dave while he's out there. Sir? Now, Dave and Bobby were old high school buddies. I know my son. This might shake him up a bit. Yes, sir, anything you need. Now I know Dave can be kind of an asshole, but you're doing a real good job of taking him under your wing. He doesn't have to know everything while he's out there, understand? Yes, sir. We have to get you a better watch. Why, I have a phone. Nevermind, did you at least check in this morning? Oh, my God, no. Hold up, it's fine. I got you, it's fine. All right, so what're we doing today? I know this guy. Are you gonna be all right to handle this? Yes, I'll be fine, damn. Look he's out there. They're all out there. We'll find them. I do have a serious question though. Shoot. Before we get started, can we please get a coffee? You gotta be kidding me, right? Come on, buddy, come on. That a boy, let's go, come on. Come on, let's go, buddy, come on, let's go! Hey, hey, hey, come on, whoa, whoa! How are they doing today? Hungry as usual, very active. I hung their breakfast so they would work for it, but they'd rather be hunting. That's good. Wolves will be wolves. How are we doing on meat? Um, we're okay with the red meat. Little light on the chicken. Probably could use a little bit more rabbit. Oh, yeah, sure. Anything else? Yeah, see if you can check into getting a mammoth for us. That should last us about a month or two. Good idea. Stop it, Todd. Lighten up, Mags. You're gonna wear yourself out. Your parents enjoyed doing this job. That's what you gotta do. You know what? What? It's been a whole year since they've been gone. I kinda had a feeling today was gonna be a rough day. Well, I finally had the courage to start going through some of their things. You know, your parents, they were good people. Dad was a genius. He knew so much about wolves, what they needed and when. How to take care of them. It was like he was part of the pack. There's lots to live up to. Give it time. That's easy for you to say. This burden hasn't passed on to you. Hey, you're not in this alone, okay? I was there for your parents. I'll be there for you. I know, Todd, thank you. Don't mess with that, seriously, you're family. Oh, that actually reminds me. When I was going through Dad's things, I finally got myself to look in the bag that they found at the scene that night. They gave you that stuff? I thought that was evidence? No, they let me have it. Anyway, it's over there with some of my dad's old stuff if you want anything. Anything good in there? Just his camera and some hunting gear. Oh, actually, there was something interesting, this old book. A book, what kind of book? Well, it's gotta be old. I mean hard to say really. I don't know. I didn't read it yet. Why trouble yourself with that stuff? It's a waste of time. Geez, Todd, who needs to lighten up now? I'm sorry, Mags. I'm just concerned about the wolves and what were going through now. Can I show you something out in the feeding pen? Yeah, sure. This better not be expensive. Look, I know this case may be a little bit rough on you. Man, I'm fine, seriously. Okay, the Chief is really worried about you digging in on this one. Yeah, telling you all this stuff while keeping me in the dark? Dude, he doesn't have any confidence in me. Man, he's just a father trying to protect his kid. All right, he's trying to protect everybody in this town. We need to cut the guy a little slack, don't you think? If you say so, man. Come on, Dave. I know he has high expectations of you, but for good reason. Dude, the only reason I'm involved in any of this stuff is because I'm your partner. I'm just here for the ride. Come on, you bring a lot to the table. Like what? Okay, Bobby, you and him were friends, right? Right. Where would he be going? What would he be doing? You mean besides drinking? Yes, Dave, besides drinking. I don't know. I know he liked to fish. Fishing, well, there you go. Did a little detective work. If he liked to fish, he'd have to pass by Frank's to pick up supplies, right? Let's go by there and see if Frank seen anything. Hey, how's it going there, Frank? Oh, hey, Connor. What can I do for ya? Frank, we got a call this morning. Oh, was it about all those folks going crazy and buying up all my inventory? I mean look at that. They bought up all the toilet paper. Of all the things you'd think. No, Frank, it wasn't about your toilet paper. I mean, that is weird though. Tell me about it. Frank, we're looking for Bobby Simmons. We have reason to believe that he might've been by here yesterday buying some fishing supplies. Have you seen him? Bobby Simmons, no, I can't say that I have, sorry. Are you sure? I keep an eye on everybody that comes in this place, okay? You never know if one of those little fuckers might be that killer that's on the loose. You know what I'm saying? Frank, come on, there's no killer, okay? Just a few missing people, that's all. I suppose Bobby's the next on that list? Didn't say that either, Frank. I don't know. I've never seen people so scared, and they're buying up all this stuff, and locking themselves in their houses. That's just not right. Frank, we're gonna get to the bottom of it. You know, hearing you say that, doesn't fill me with one iota of confidence that this situation is gonna get taken care of anytime soon. All right, Frank, let's calm down. We have people working around the clock on this, all right? Can I help you, miss? I'm looking for my husband, Bobby Simmons. Thought he might've stopped in here. Well, I'll be. So are these fine gentlemen right here. Hi, Sarah, I'm Detective Ryan. You may know my partner, Dave. Yeah, I know Dave. What's going on? We were actually on our way to come see you. Okay. Hey, Frank, can you give us a sec? Sure, go ahead, help yourself. It's not like you don't have an office about six doors down where you can conduct your business. Sarah, we were assigned to your husband's case this morning. I don't understand. They told me it had to be at least 24 hours before anyone could do anything, what's wrong? Well, that's usually the case, all right, but as you know, Dave and Bobby were good friends in high school, and he wanted to get a jump on this one. Hey. Hello. What can you tell us, Sarah, that might help us find him? Where would he be going? What would he be doing? His sorry ass is probably passed out drunk somewhere in the mud. That does sound like the Bobby I knew. This one time we found him passed out on the floor of the... Now let's calm down here. Take a deep breath. What can you tell us, Sarah? He might be the town drunk, but he's a good man, a good man. Yes, nobody said anything differently. What happened last night? I already told the guy on the phone earlier. I understand, ma'am, but it would really help me if I could hear it again. So, last night him and I, well, we kinda got into a little argument, but then he stormed off in his truck, and said he needed to blow off some steam. Okay, it's okay, it's okay. What made you think to look for him here? Well, if he's not out drinking at the fuckin' bar, he's usually fishing. Okay, Sarah, that helps a lot. All right, there's only a few spots on that river he can get to at night. Won't you just go on home. Me and Dave will go around there and take a look. If we find anything, we'll give you a call. Does that sound good? Yeah, good idea. Thank you. You're welcome. Oh, shit, there's Bobby's truck. Oh, my God, that stinks. What is that? Oh, Jesus, nasty! Yeah, he's not there either. Let's go down this way. Yeah, let's do that. All right, listen. There's two trails. You're gonna go down that way. I'm gonna go down this way. All right. Oh, shit, Connor, Connor, Connor, Connor! Son of a bitch. What is that? Christ, dude, he's been torn apart! Easy, calm down. Assess the situation. What's missing here? His leg! Yeah, Dave, I know his leg, but look. There's no flies, maggots, nothing. Maggots, what does that have to do with anything? Bobby's truck, they were full of them. Look at this, there's nothing. This kill is just a few hours old. And this, does that look like a coyote print to you? No, dude, that would be a big ass coyote! Hey, Dave, do you remember that girl last summer. You mean the wolf girl? Yeah, Dave, the wolf girl. I think we should call her and get her up here. Oh, Jesus. Are you okay? No, dude, before we had just a bunch of missing person reports. I figured eventually they would just turn back up, and now we have this, and you're talking about wolves? Calm the fuck down! This is the job you signed up for! Now, do me a favor! Go back there and call Dr. Keely! Dr. Keely? The fuckin' coroner, Dave! Okay! Okay. Shit. Maggie Talbot. Miss Talbot, this is Detective Ryan at Mantua Police Department. Connor? You remember? What can I do for you? Maggie, it seems that we have another animal attack. And you're calling me? You must think it's a wolf. I don't know to be honest with you. There's a lot about this case I don't understand. I could really use your insight on this one. Well, wolves haven't been seen in the wild in this part of the country for decades. I'll leave out the details for now, but it's pretty violent. Okay, you know wolves are highly misunderstood creatures, and very rarely attack humans, I mean. Yes, ma'am, I understand, but there's really something off about this one. You could have coywolves. What's a coywolf? It's a crossbreed between a coyote and a wolf. You know wolves have been known to cross with other species. That can actually happen? Yeah, of course. I mean I'd have to see the evidence to know for sure, but. Well, listen, this is out of my skill set. Are you available to come take a look? Sure. How soon could you get here? Um, not long. I just have to pack a few things and I'll be on my way. Sounds good, thank you. Hmm. Hold it, hold up! - What's going on? - The police down in Mantua think that someone was attacked by a wolf. A wolf in that area, bullshit. That's what the man said. You want me to come with you? No, it's probably just a coyote, but just in case I'm gonna check it out. I should come with you, hold on. Let me get a few things, all right? No, no, Todd, don't worry about it. I got this. You stay here with the wolves. Don't go chasing that legend. Legend, what're you talking about? Nothing, just be careful. In fact, take this. Come on, I don't need a gun. No, seriously, please, take it. Fine. I'll be back in a day or two, okay? Oh, man. Hey, Connor! What the fuck is wrong with you? You look good on camera, man. You could be one of those outdoorsy models. You know what? One minute you're pissing your pants. Next you're a fuckin' paparazzi. I swear you have multi personalities. I knew it. I'm so sorry. Check this out. Scandal. I know, right? What do you think they're saying? Something messy, that's for sure. Definitely, and she's all like, "You have to leave before my loser husband comes home." Yeah, and he's like, "You're totally right, babe. "That dude totally sucks." "We can't keep doing this. "It's just , too much." "Fine, if you want it that way, "I'll take this fine ass somewhere else." Oh, shit, I think he heard us. Relax, can't hear us from all the way over there. Ah, could he? Fuck, he did. That dude has incredible hearing. And an incredible ass. Oh, please, he's so out of our league. Speak for yourself, sister. Look, look, watch. Damn. Can I help you, miss? Yes, I'm here to see Detective Ryan. He's expecting me. And who should I say is here? Maggie Talbot. Okay, ah, just take a seat, Miss Talbot. He'll be out in just a few moments. You have a Maggie Talbot here to see you. Miss Talbot. Please call me Maggie. Of course, thank you for coming by. Come on back. So Maggie how is it you have so much knowledge in this field? I mean, to be completely honest with you, a lot of people thought you were crazy last year looking for wolves in Ohio. Well, it's in the family business. My parents raised me in this life. So they help you with this? Ah, not anymore, no. Off the better things, I guess. Ah, not exactly. Last year, we lost on an expedition in Alaska, so. Oh, Maggie, I... No, I mean, it's not your fault. They were actually up there looking for wolf pack territory patterns when they both went missing. I am so sorry, really. It seems like you have a lot of resilience carrying on. Well, the conservation center's what keeps their legacy alive for me. Of course, I understand. Well, I don't wanna take up too much of your time, but here's some of the tufts of hair that we found around the body. The body? I didn't mention it? No, you said there was an animal attack. You thought it was wolves. Well, technically you said wolves. Semantics, I think we're getting off track here. Yeah, you're right. Is there anything else to show me here? Yes, actually I found some interesting remains. This doesn't make any sense. Wolves don't really attack people. Not to mention they've all been eradicated from the lower 48. It's just hard to believe a pack large enough to do this would go undetected. Am I interrupting anything? Maggie, I think you know my partner, Dave. Yeah, of course. Nice to see you again. Likewise, so what do you make of all this? I'm not sure yet. I mean, I have to see more evidence of wolves to make a determination. Dave, did you process the photos of Bobby yet? No, no, but you can take her to go see the body in person, can't you? That's a good idea. Would you be up to that, Maggie? Sure. I think I'll stay here and finish processing the evidence. I'll drive. Oh, hello, Connor. Hi, Dr. Keely. This is Maggie Talbot from the Wolf sanctuary. Oh, yes, nice to meet you, Maggie. Forgive me for not shaking your hand. Oh, no problem. Well, since we're all here, brace yourself. It's not pretty. You can clearly see the teeth marks here, but not on the leg where you might expect. It's more of a tear than a bite here. Are you okay, Maggie? Yeah, I'm fine. There's just something really strange about this. It looks like a straight kill. What do you mean straight kill? I was thinking the same thing. What she's saying is that it doesn't look as though anything was consumed, not much anyway. It's obvious this animal didn't kill for food. I mean this type of aggression could be a possible territorial issue. Like protecting a den of pups? I mean that's possible, but unlikely. It still would've consumed the meat. There's a lot here that doesn't make sense yet. We still have a lot more investigating to do. Have you had a chance to check out the other remains yet? Not yet, I kind of got my hands full with this one. Of course, ma'am. I'll let you know as soon as I find anything new. Thanks, Doc, appreciate it. Skee, Skee, damn it, Skee, no! God damn, Skee, look at me! Skee, look at me! Hold on, hold on! Don't, Skee, God, no! No! Ryan, your pickup is ready at the pharmacy counter. Ryan, the pharmacy counter. Maggie, you should know that people have gone missing around here. We have this case. Really it's all these cases and it's got me stumped. And until today, I thought all these cases were unrelated. Wait, so Bobby isn't the only one you're working on? Really, it's not safe around here. You know, we should go get your car, and I'll follow you to the hotel, and we'll just pick this back up in the morning. You got a second, Chief? Yeah, come on in. Need to give my eyes a rest from these reports anyhow. Anything new to report? I mean, yeah. I just got a bad feeling about all this. Hey there, boss. Hey, find any wolves? Well, we found something, although I don't think it's wolves. Coyotes then, just like you thought. Not unless a coyote can tear the legs off a man. Wait a minute. What did you say? They found a body out here that was torn apart. It's got slashes and teeth marks, but nothing like I've ever seen, Todd. Hold up, are you safe? Yeah, Todd, I'm fine. Have you heard of anything like this? Listen, Maggie, stay where you are. Don't go out. I'm on my way to you. Wait, what aren't you telling me? I'll explain when I get there. Just stay safe. I'll call when I'm close. So, if what you're telling me is true, we have a killer on the loose. Well, yeah, we have to tell people, right? Have you looked around when you've been out there? People are already hiding scared. Last thing we wanna do is create any sort of panic. Yea, come on in, Connor. What do you think of all this? To be honest, sir, I'm not sure, but I do know we don't need people walking on the streets at night. Seems to be when all the action happens. Hmm, that's a good idea. Maybe we need to issue a temporary curfew. Yes, sir. I think I'll give a mayor call. I just said that. Call Detective Ryan. Dr. Keely, what've you got? Some information for you on those skeletal remains. I'm listening. We ran some tests, and determined that some of the bones were broken. Based on how you found them, this would indicate a heavy impact or a blunt trauma. That's not good. Exactly, but that's not all. We found multiple stress fractures on the skull. How could that have happened? Well, the fracture patterns indicate equal pressure from both sides of the skull. Perhaps the vic's head was squeezed or crushed. Oh, shit, any more on the ID's? The lab reports indicate the DNA is consistent with the first missing person. So, it's related? I'm still waiting on reports of the second set for confirmation. Okay, thanks, Doc. Hey, Connor, wait. Yeah. Be careful out there. I've never seen anything like this before. Right. Did you have trouble finding the place? You know me, Mags. I can track anything down, especially you. Let's just get to it. What aren't you telling me, Todd? What'd you bring that for? I promised your dad, I wouldn't get you involved in this, and now I gotta break that promise, Mag. Involved with what? Look, I lied to you earlier. I know exactly what this is and what it's all about. This is your dad's hunting guide of sort. All his information, what he's done, et cetera. What are you talking about? He was a hunter, and he hunted werewolves. Todd, are you having a stroke? I mean, what do you mean werewolves, like shape-shifting, eat your livestock in the middle of the night werewolves, I mean? No, no, no, no, no, that can't be true. This, this can't be true. It is, all of it is. So when Mom and Dad went missing, they were hunting werewolves. Yes, I, I had a vision. I told your dad, don't go on this. I've got a bad feeling, but he insisted on wanting to go. He says, stay back, take care of Mags in case something happens to us and I did. Are they dead? I don't, I don't know. I, I don't know, Mags, I honestly don't. Jesus. Tell me everything you know, and start with that. Okay, I will. Wolves haven't been seen in the wild in this part of the country for decades. Wolves are highly misunderstood creatures, and very rarely attack humans. It's obvious this animal didn't kill for food. There's just something really strange about this type of aggression. This is really tough to translate. We realize the languages here aren't all the same. Some go back centuries, even more, from all over the world. Most from which we don't have record of. So, whoever assembled this must have been a hunter. As long as werewolves have been around, there've been people hunting them. You sound like you're on the side of the werewolves. You have to understand werewolves are people too. They are literally tortured with this condition. It's not their fault they're like this. They've experienced great trauma and they're cursed. We only kill werewolves if we have to to protect others. Well, the people of this town need protecting from what's out there, Todd. Look here, we know the werewolves emerge at night, but during the day they're human, and almost always demonstrates these symptoms. Have you encountered anyone here in this town with these descriptions? No, but Connor might know something. I got it. Ryan. Connor, it's Maggie. I got something here you need to see. You're still at the hotel, right? Yeah. Okay, give me an hour or so. I'm just finishing up at around here, hang tight. Hey, Connor, thanks for coming. Of course. This is my friend, Todd, from the sanctuary. Nice to meet you. Likewise, please have a seat. So, Connor, I noticed on my way in, the town's pretty dead, nobody around? Yeah, well, empty street make my job a lot easier. I bet. Todd can be very observant. I bet. So ah, what've we got here? Do you wanna tell him, or should I? Tell me what? Ugh, whatever, Karen! I see a little bit of a carcass or something. A carcass? Yeah. I fuckin' told you. Hello? Get me out of here. Why, more lame suburban crime? No, dude, my mom is driving me fucking crazy. I need to go out. What are you doing later? We interrupt this program for a special report. Hold on. We're asking all the residents to stay off the streets tonight. We will be issuing a curfew just as a precaution. Jer, are you watching the news right now? Ah, ew, no. Our main objective is to keep everyone safe. Please just stay calm and comply to this order. Well, apparently we're not doing anything later. The Chief has ordered us to stay off the streets, and we have some sort of curfew now. It's not a problem. We'll just go to our spot in the woods. See, I follow rules, no streets. You're so clever. I know, grab Jessica and meet me there later. Okay, whatever. Follow these orders, and that is how we will all stay safe. Thank you for your cooperation, and we will plan to keep the public informed of any new developments as they arise. Jesus, this is a lot to take in. Hmm. And you believe this. Honestly, I do. I mean everything I saw, everything I know, it just points to this being real. Well then I guess I have no choice but to believe it too, even though I don't want to. Then you and I need to get out there and hunt this thing down before it kills somebody else, okay. Wait, like now? That's not a good idea. Look, I've been doing this for a while now. We need to hunt this thing down tonight. That's not safe. Trust me, I'll meet up with you guys tomorrow morning, okay? No, you're not going out there alone. Maggie's right, we should wait till morning. Okay, first light, all right? Come dawn, we break. So we're in agreement. Don't you stick around here tonight. Agreed, right, Todd? Right, all right, well, I'll be back in the morning. I think we need to watch yourselves around him. Who, Connor, why? I don't know. There's something about him and I can't put my finger on it. Well, come on. Let's find you a room in this place, I'm exhausted. Hey, Chief, you working late? Yeah, and the work's never done. Come on in. So anything new? No Connor's out on a couple of leads now, and I've been going through these crime scene photos trying to figure out if there's something we possibly could have missed. Divide and conquer. Something like that. You look fried, Dad. Didn't Connor tell you to call me Chief around here? Right, but I'm talking as your son now. You can't help anybody like this. Yeah, maybe you're right. So much for easing out of this job and into retirement. Stop, that's what quitters say. You raised me better than that, right? I mean, don't get me wrong. There's a lot going on for an old guy like you to try to conquer. You're still a sharpshooter, and it's what this town needs right now. Hmm. Well, I'll drink to that. That's what I'm talking about. Boo! You fucking asshole! Oh, my God, I'm so sorry. Are you okay? No. Way to go, Jer! You jumped out in front of me. What was I supposed to do? Hey, there's only one thing that'll make this better. - What? - What? Never come to a party empty handed! Seriously, Amanda? Oh, relax, Jer. Come on, let's go. Woo hoo hoo! Do you remember that one summer when we sent you away for camp? Not really, why? Well, I don't think your mom and I ever told you this. We sent you away because we wanted you to have some structure in your life. And you were a pretty big asshole when you were a little kid. Some things never change, right? Yeah, you know, we thought we had it all figured out. Send you away for a couple of weeks. Enjoy the peace and quiet. Thought everything would turn out great. And did it? No, no, Dave, it didn't. You see, ah, we thought we had it all figured out, but your little brother, he was destroyed when you weren't there. Really? He would just sit, look out the window for hours just waiting for you to come home. We'd tell him, "Go on out, go play, have some fun, be a kid." He wouldn't do it. He just sat there waiting for you. I know the bond between brothers can be special. It was like you two were connected, because when you weren't there, part of him was missing. Why are you telling me this? You know, it's not easy for me to admit that I'm wrong. Dad, it was just camp. I'm not talking about camp. You know, parents do all sorts of strange things to ah, protect their kids, and I've been keeping things from you around here. I've been doing it for your own good. Like what? Well, nothing major, but ah, some little things. But those little things can add up to big things, especially for the cases that we're working on. I guess what I'm trying to say is time for me to take off the training wheels, because I can't protect you forever. I think I just need to get out of your way, and let you do your job. I've never heard you talk like this before. To be honest, I had no idea you had it in you. Well, don't get used to it, because tomorrow I'm never gonna be wrong again. Ugh, guys, I just don't understand why we are being punished with this curfew. Like, it's our civil right to go out. This is an injustice. That's exactly what this is. You know I don't drink. Come on. Yeah, don't be such a puss, Jer. Give me that. Bitches, please, I have my vices. They just happen to be different than yours. You mean trashier than ours. The irony, my sweet tart. Jess, help me up, bitches! Guys, shut up for a second. No, you shut it. No, guys, seriously, shut the fuck up! I think I just saw something move behind you. What? Do you see anything? Guys, what it is? Come on! Come on, come on, where is everybody? No! Dad? Maggie, go back. No, I'm, I'm not gonna leave you. Maggie, go! Oh, oh, Dad! Todd! Todd, wake up, it's Maggie! I'm up. I need to show you something. Look at these shots. What does that mean? - Where did you get this? - That's Dad's camera? I found the card hidden in the book. Look, why does my father have a picture of Connor in Alaska? Is it possible? What, what do you mean? Well, the last time I talked with your father, he was tracking a lead on a werewolf. He was suspicious of a young man in town. Good looking kid, had a scar on his shoulder. Connor's always rubbing his shoulder like he injured it. I thought there was something about him. So, what do we do? Look, Maggie, I promised your father I'd keep you safe, so we aren't going to do anything tonight. Stay in your room, lock the door, and don't go anywhere, okay? Todd, he might know about my parents. I can't just sit here and wait. You have to. I tried to warn your parents. They didn't listen to me. I'm not gonna let this happen again. Fine. Look, Maggie, I promised your father I'd keep you safe, so we aren't gonna do anything tonight. Oh, God. Shit. You're not in this alone, okay? I was there for your parents. I'll be there for you. I know, Todd. Don't mess with that, I mean seriously, you're family. Fuck this, I can't wait anymore. Todd, it's time to go! Todd, get up! Todd? Shit. Oh good, you're here. Didn't you go home last night? No, sir. Well, get yourself together. We've got another dead body in town. Shit. Come on, we better get going. I need you on the scene. Where's your partner? Don't know, sir. All right, well, let's go. I'll fill him in later. Hello, anyone here, hello? Sorry, it's been crazy around here. How can I help? I'm looking for Detective Ryan. He just left. Can I leave a message? Shit, no, no message. Where did he go? I'm sorry, I can't give you that information. Seriously? I've been working with him on this investigation. What did you say your name was? Maggie, Maggie Talbot. Please, I really need to talk to him. This is important. Okay, let me try. 10-100 to 10-04. 10-100 to 10-04. 10-100 to 10-04. 10-100 to 10-04.

And part of him was missing when you weren't there. Sorry, I'm so sorry. It's okay, it's okay. Everything's gonna be fine. Family and friends, we thank you for allowing us this honor. We, the members of this Honor Guard assembled here today didn't personally know Matt Ryan, but we do recognize him as a comrade in arms. Honor Guard, 10-hut, port arms! We understand his commitment and service to his country as a member of the Marines during tours of duty in Afghanistan. Ready, aim, fire! We know the loneliness, fatigue, boredom, and terror of combat service. Aim, fire! When the call of our country was heard Comrade Ryan answered. Self was forgotten in the cause of greater good. Aim, fire! When someone you love is so valued, a memory is the byproduct. That memory surely becomes a treasure. Let us now remember what this soldier's life was and is. On behalf of the United States of America, United States Marine Corps, and a grateful nation, we present this to you in behalf of your sibling's great honorable service to his country. Connor , hi, it's been awhile. Is everything all right? Wait, what? Copy that.
