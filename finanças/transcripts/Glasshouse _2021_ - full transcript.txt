I don't wanna have to teach him again. You saw him practicing. Why didn't you take the shot? Because... I could get a good look first. Why? Because he used to be the same as us. And what if it's Luca? But we're the same on the inside. Am I that gooey too? You are even gooier! Eew! He looked like beef stew! It's okay. I know you try. I got one. He was going for my peas. But Evie got him good. That's my girl. You keep the beasts from our door. Are beasts the same as animals? There are no animals, Daisy. Just forgetters. Same thing, really. No, it's not. Animals aren't boring like forgetters. There might be some left, but Luca comes back, he can tell us.

He's still upset. You shouldn't have corrected him. He wasn't going to remember. Enough. Go calm him. Whatever he needs, single stroke. He's too big for a tantrum. Let me see your mask. I need to go. You're no good go me if your mind is shredded to bits. You don't trust me. A wise mother knows never to trust her children. Luca, Luca. Luca, Luca. Luca, Luca. Luca, Luca. What are you doing? Get out of the way. You're breaking the rules. So, tell on me, then. Go on, run to mother. Perhaps I am the one with memory shred, because I thought I taught you better. This one might be like us. Bee, remind me of our first rule. Never let a stranger enter the sanctuary. You have welcomed a shred across our threshold. -He's a forgetter. -You don't know that. -He's sacred. -Be quiet, Daisy. I won't! The second rule says the sanctuary an all it holds, is sacred. He's inside now, so, that means he's sacred. -I'm right! -Exactly. He's under our protection. Please, Mother. What if he's seen Luca? He needs our help. Fetch my scissors. If it gets infected, he'll die anyway. And then he'll be compost. Everything serves its purpose. Everything serves its purpose. You're going to learn how to stitch a wound, girls. Can I try? Me next. Once upon a time, when time still existed, there was a girl searching for a home. She wandered through a land of bad men and beasties who wanted her for their own. But the girl was too clever to be caught. At last... ...she came upon an enchanted castle made of glass. Only people who remembered their names could enter there. And the girl knew, finally, she was safe, because monsters have no names. They have no family to remember them. She shut out the forgetting, and painted her story so that her children could see their history as clear as the lines of their hands. That girl... ...was you. Good boy. Only one sleeping strap for you tonight, What do you think we'll do with the others? Him. Will he tell us about animals? He might not be able to speak. I hope he wakes up tomorrow. The less you heard, the safer you will be. I need your help with Gabe. What is it? He wet the bed. All right, I'm coming. Don't move, then. Have a little patience. So, he lands up with we're always there to clean up his piss for him. He doesn't like change. Well, I do. Where do you think he came from? Do you really think he's like us? You can help, quick. It's impossible to tell anything with his eyes closed. I wonder how many words he has. Hope he's not as bad as Gabe. You're late for sentry duty. Go on, before your eyes fall out from staring. -But I want to stay-- -No. We need more water to wash his wounds. Don't try anything. I wouldn't. May I have some water? What's the B for? That's me. Bee. Who are you? This is my sister, Evie. What happened to your leg? Can you remember? What is this place? It's our home. His bandages need finishing. I must be summoned the moment he wakes. I'm sure he wouldn't dare to wake without you present. I should hope not. Gabe, look after your sister. I don't need his help. Oh? How old are you now? Old enough. Come on, then, Gabe. Daisy is doing sentry duty alone today. Stay sharp, my girl. We're in your hands. Is this what the world used to be like? Don't worry. We've seen a man's body before. There's a fresh one under the pumpkin seedlings. He'll try them if you're not careful. Mother is back. Go to your room, Gabe. What is your name? I don't think I ever had one. Where did you come from? East. The city. I passed through. Is there anything left? Nothing like this. How many remain? The Shred has taken most. They scavenge, or they starve. Or they hunt. What happened? Were you hunter, or prey? I was attacked. I'm alive because of her. Did someone tell you about us? I don't think so. You seem to forget when it suits you. Doesn't everyone? It's the only mercy The Shred gives us. Are you going to let me go? You could be dangerous. I owe you my life. What if you forget that, when it suits you? You'll be put to work. I don't feed idle mouths. Don't worry. Mother won't let him stay. I have a surprise for you. You made this. Me? When you were very small. You used to make all sorts of things. You want to try? Such a clever boy. Gabe! Do you trust me? Don't move. Gabe? Time to be brave. See? He's just like us. He looks like a funny man with a tail. He jumps to get around. Did you ever see him? Maybe a sheep. Sheeps are the fluffy ones... All the friendly animals are gone, Daisy. Your kangaroo would be very hungry. This is the only patch of green in three days' walk. Oh. That's a pretty picture. It's not a picture, it's words. That's a lot of letters to remember. I know all of them. - Who taught you? - Daisy, your signs haven't been very effective in discouraging trespassers. Take Gabe out with you to remark the boundary. Dig up the last trespasser, and make a special warning to go with Daisy's signs. We get to play with the fresh one. I brought you one of everything we grow, so you can find your favorite. When I mend something, I make it nicer than it was before. Like where I sewed you up. I noticed. Daisy's book has some nice pictures. We all read that when we were little. Daisy still believes it's real. You can all read? I can teach you. Can Gabe read, too? Not anymore. The younger it gets you, the more The Shred takes. So, you want to... ...tie a knot at the end, like this, so it doesn't slip through. The tomatoes are sad. Did you feed them? I did, this morning, after you forgot. And Gabe's sheets? All washed. Well, then, they need hanging. You don't know this man, Bee. I feel like I already do. You can't trust so soon. Sorry. It's just... You don't trust anything you can't put in your box. What is it made of? It's just glue, to keep everything air tight. We reseal the windows every season. And who did these? We all paint, but I'm the best. They look like stories. Our story. Chapel is the heart from in. There's Daisy, Gabe and Evie, the babies, and me. And him? I everything. Come, you can sit here. No. That's Luca's place. Put him there. Who's Luca? Our brother. It's cold tonight. Thank you. Luca! His leg is going to fall off. Don't be silly. I didn't raise you that way. You are healing nicely. Considering Bee tried to turn you into an embroidery. You'll be moving easily again soon. Will I? When your leg gets better, I'll show you my touch of the garden, and we can do a relay race, cause there's enough of us now. Hold your horses. I can hardly even walk yet. -Horse is a animals. -That's right. Do you have a picture of one in that book of yours? No. But I think they're fluffy, and about this big. Otherwise, how would you hold them? Horses are as tall as I am. Do they eat people? No. Horses are fast, and smart. Smarter than sheeps. Horses are my favorite now. Do your sisters have any favorites? Bee likes the bee, cause it's her. And Evie? Evie likes this one. I'll make you a little horse of your own, if you'd like. I'll need to whittle it out of wood. Could you bring me a knife, Daisy? ♪ Never caught in summer or a farm ♪ ♪ To rem the growth But never own ♪ ♪ You'll know the branch The bud ♪ ♪ Seasons slows With shows on blood ♪ It's your first. We have enough to start shelling. Is it bad? The world beyond? Lonely. What you've built here, doesn't exist out there, having people, a place. I've been looking for a long time. I feel like something drew me here. A memory? Did you play this with Luca? He and Bee played everything together, that's why Mother called them the mirrors. Why did he leave? He wanted to know how many there are like us. Someday he'll come back and tell. How do you know he'll come back? He will. He'll flash the signal. I will know it's him. Okay, do you ever stop digging? Go with Daisy to get water. Horse. It's for Daisy. See? Stop! Daisy! Remove this! I can help. Shh. That's enough. Take his straps back to his bunk. All of it. What a shame. Ruined forever. It's not funny. Stop it, Luca. I'm not. I can't be. Why not? Because I don't feel for you... ...the way a brother should. Then you are Luca. ♪ Follow root And fruit and flower ♪ ♪ Fertile as our daughters ♪ ♪ For the rain not brings Clean water ♪ ♪ For it brings sand first ♪ So, we brush the pollen on like this. The last bee left in the woods. And when we're done, we're not going to pollinate it with a wet brush. I-- Oh, I-- I left it in the seed shed. I'll fetch it. I want to be pollinated, too. -What is that? -Nothing. Just an old game. How do you play? We'd each put an object in a box and then we bury it. Then the next day we would dig it up and see who could remember what was inside. And who used to win? Me and Luca put the same thing in every time. Shall we play? The game ended after he left. I have a treasure hunt for you, instead. I've been sent to find Red Frit. Bee is pollinating. We do that together. Come join, then. Daisy is singing the litany. That's not for you to hear. I know these rituals are important to your family. You use them to remember who you are. That's what this is, isn't it? You don't know anything about us. Are you sure? Evie's memory box... She let me look in it. She hides it from us. Can't find it anywhere. Was it always Evie's? Reminds me of a game. Yes. What game? You were too little. Luca always used to put my favorite thing inside. That's why I'd remember. Strawberries. -I want to play. -Ask Evie. She's the one who never grew out of it. Do you mind? Would you mind if I minded? I'll leave, if you like. I'll just need to give this leg a minute. How is it healing? Fast, apparently. Not fast enough for you, though. I didn't mean to offend you earlier. You all have a part to play. I feel useless. You've had a long time to learn. I'd like to help. If I was on duty that night, I would have shot you. I'm lucky I didn't stumble in eight hours earlier. If I had a family, I'd do anything for them, too. You can give me a sentry shift. I can help watch the border. Watch yourself, instead. Everything in this house is given a purpose. The seeds are here to be planted, the fruit to ripen and be plucked. You know what your purpose is? I think you have one in mind. I do. You won't find her up there. I want a story, an adventure one. Not a boring one, like Mother's. You're lucky I'm too comfortable to smack you. You tell one. Luca used to tell the most wonderful stories. I have a fairytale, if it would please you, Daisy. It shall. Once there was a one-eyed king who lived in the land of the blind. He led his people well, but their praise soon lost its flavor. How could he trust that they truly loved him? They wouldn't know if an imposter took his place. He had been among the blind so long, he'd forgotten his own face. So, he searched the land for a one-eyed queen, someone who could look upon him, and remind him who he was. That's silly. Why didn't he just look in the mirror? He's not Luca, Bee. Then how did he remember? Because... you told him. You know you can't trust your memories. No. You can't trust your heart. Evie, you said we could go out. Not now. But I want to test my new sail boat. Go away, Gabe. What holds your bones together? Meat? No. Meat is what moves you. Cartilage? Yes. Cartilage and collagen stick your skeleton together. Like glue? That's why those are the bits we boil down. Did you like watching? Nice aim. You never take your eyes off me, do you? Can't take your eyes off the snake. Your favorite animal? Those tricks work on Bee, but they don't work on me. She wants Luca back too badly to see the truth. But you don't. Why? Because he chose her instead of you? Luca knew I didn't feel that way for him. Maybe this time is different. Don't mess with Bee's mind. It's fragile enough as it is. Where did your necklace come from? Mother makes them for us when we're born. Do you ever take them off? -Why would we do that? -I don't know. Maybe if you forgot what it means. That would be very sad. Come,. We gather in-- No! This ritual is sacred. The only person ruining the ritual, is you. He doesn't belong. It's Luca's. He's come home. That isn't yours! I've always kept it safe. I had just forgotten what it meant. We're not safe from The Shred, even here! Can't you see? He's using my memories against us. He's changing you, Bee! And making me happy. Gabe doesn't trust him either. But the amulet is the same as ours. How do we know that you didn't attack Luca and steal it? -You've forgotten me, Evie. -No! I'm the one who remembers. You think your memories are the only ones that can be trusted. What if you're wrong? What if you're betraying -your own brother? -I'm not! He's a stranger. You're spoiling everything! Why can't you just let him be Luca? So we can die? You all live in a fantasy! Evie just wants to twist everyone else's reality -to be as miserable as hers. -Enough! Evie is trying to protect the family. It's a duty I had hoped you would shoulder as the eldest, but you've shrugged it, just as Luca did. If Evie was so good at protecting the family... ...then Gabe wouldn't be like this. You were supposed to be watching him, but instead, you were spying on us like the jealous little creep you are. Not all changes are good, Bee. You didn't use to be cruel. Daisy, you will say Evie's lines. The ritual must be completed. This was once a man, but he was washed away from himself. He forgot, and became forgotten. Shall I take it to her? We eat all together, or not at all. Right, Mother? Give her the time she needs. I'll help. - Will he be all right? -He's on edge. It's Evie's fault for being so dramatic. Everything she does, affects him. She should know better. I don't want to be the cause of a rift between you two. It's not your fault. She's always been jealous. I wish she could find her own happiness, but... ...she doesn't seem capable. Maybe we aren't supposed to remember everything. Why can I see what no one else can? Come here. Am I the only one who thinks the truth matters? Let Bee believe what makes her happy. Do you trust him? Shh. Trust your mother to take care of this family. You know I always have a plan. As soon as the child comes, he'll be gone. Luca always leaves. What's wrong? Nothing. What's that noise? It's the natural rhythm of things. If you exercise every day, you'll get more movement back. I'd like to be more useful now. I could do sentry duty alone. Stay with Bee on her shifts. You haven't bled yet. Is that a planting calendar? I was thinking I could sow another row of oats. That won't be necessary. How are you feeling, my bumbling Bee? Happy. No faintness? Nausea? No. Why do you always think I'm being bad? I don't. I know you've been wearing your mask. But it's important that you keep being so good. The toxin can do a terrible damage... to a baby. Baby? But-- But I don't know how to have a baby. The body remembers what the mind does not. Babies are a blessing, a new life, a new mouth, and a new pair of lungs. But such a small pair. Our sanctuary has its limits. Our leaves work very hard to keep us safe. They can only provide so many clean breaths. What-- Well then, plant more! There's a balance. Balance requires sacrifice. No! No! Go fuck your balance! You wanted him. You had him, and there are consequences. No! No, I won't give him up! I'm not like you! Then you'll have to choose. Who will you get rid of? Choose? Choose? No, I can't do that! Lucky you have me to make the right decision. Fine! I will choose. And you'll be sorry. No, I can't! No, I can't! Gabe! No, wait! It's not fair! It's not fair! Where is Gabe? Gabe? Gabe? Not again! Not again! Not again! Not again! I'm sorry! -I'm sorry! I'm sorry! -Not again! Don't breathe him in. -You didn't wear your mask. -Don't worry about me. I shouldn't have let him get out. You let it happen again. -It's not your fault. -It is! No! You watched him forget, and when there's nothing left, you move on. This is just how things are! Maybe for you! Out there, the Shred, it takes the minds, no matter what! But I could've kept him safe! You didn't know him. He had the most beautiful mind, and he lost it because of me. Come. Have sentry duty. Move! Unless you want to be exposed. Bee! Wait! What's going on? Mother says now that I'm pregnant, you have to go. What? If you're having my baby, why would she want me gone? We breathe too much. The plants, they can't make enough oxygen, but I won't have it. If she makes you go, I'll go with you. But I'm her son. You went last time. I'm not leaving again. The one-eyed king has found his queen. What do you mean? I'll tell you another time. Mother will see. As long as we're together, we'll keep the balance. Yes, we will. Gabe! -No! -Please. No. Like this. Not too long ago you were chained to the stove. Now you wander the house at night. Don't worry. Your mother will be rid of me soon enough. Will you put something in your box to remember me? Put something back, you mean? Would you rather forget? What is there to forget? I don't know who you are. I've been forgotten many times, but you could know me, if you wanted to. And I think you'd like to be known. In time to see you go? Maybe you are Luca. What makes you say that? Luca always leaves. There's no such thing as always. Things can change. Some things can't be undone. You don't have to punish yourself eternally, Evie. We're not in hell. Are you sure? What you do with Gabe... You don't have to. He deserves to be happy. So do you. Distracted by the view? You... don't... look. It's hard not to. Anyone would be lucky to have her. Evie loves me. I suppose pity is a kind of love. It's a shame you're not the man for her, Gabe. You'll never be what she needs. Hurry! It's broken! I can't stop him! We need to seal it! -Grab the glue! -Quick! Hold your breath! It's getting in! What happened? Gabe broke the glass. Think what you could have done, Gabe! He doesn't think. It was an accident. Gabe, is this true? No real harm done. Less the night have been done. I'm only glad I was there when it happened. Yes. Lucky that you've been so near both times that Gabe lost control. How much control do you think he has? He's a growing boy, and a growing threat. You feel something must be done about it. I know you'd never mean to hurt anymore. Do you think maybe he would be happier, less of a risk outside? We have a child to think of now. And I must thank you for that gift to my family. Don't do this. The longer you've been here, the more unstable Gabe has become. You said it yourself. Something must be done. You're making the wrong choice. Time for you to go. You can stay. We're all family here. It's my turn on sentry duty. The girl knew, finally, she was safe, because monsters have no names. Why? No... ...family. Very good. But you have a family who will remember you always. Some things may change, but never that. What is it, boy? You've never called me by name. I don't know it. Luca. No mother forgets her own child. Evie! You don't have to worry about your family. I'll take care of them now. You actor... Every act becomes true with time. You're so sure... of your one eye... Has it seen who... ...else... ...is pretending? Mother? Mother? Mother! Wake up. Wake... up! Wake up! Mom... No. What have you done, Gabe? No, Gabe! No, wait! - Mother? - I found them like this. No, Gabe wouldn't. He wouldn't! I'm so sorry. I don't understand, Evie. Gabe would never hurt Mother. He's never hurt anyone. Gabe can't know what happened in his sleep. He has horrible nightmares. And-- And he's so strong now, he must have lashed out at her, without even knowing what he was doing. And by the time Luca came in, it was too late. It could have happened that way, right, Evie? I can't give you the answer you want, Bee. You see what you want to. Don't be scared. It's for the best. I've seen everyone I've ever loved disintegrate in front of me. My parents, my sister... I watched them forget the meaning of those words, so, I took off my mask. I wanted to forget. just like Bee. But the toxin never touched me. I remember everything. I don't know what makes me different. I live each day with what I've lost. So do you. I've seen how you struggle, altered by what you used to be, grasping for a past that will always be just beyond your reach. Memory is pain, Gabe. I'm setting you free. I don't want Mother to become glue. Or a pumpkin. She won't, Daisy. You would have to do a ritual. We can keep her in her bedroom. She can stay there! Daisy, she's going to rot! Come, Daisy. Let her rest now. It's nearly dawn. Would you like to sleep in Mother's room? No! Okay. Okay. You can sleep with us. Luca. Luca. Luca. Luca! He couldn't signal. I didn't know it was him, I didn't know. I know you didn't. All those years... You let me wait for him. -I was trying to protect you. -No! I protected myself. You let me remember! You choose to forget, -but I can't. -Why do you have to control everything? You dug him up like a graver, in you fucking book! You were never supposed to find it. So then, let's erase it. No, Bee. As long as you remember, it will always be real. Come. I love you... but I can't. We'll forget together. I'm sorry, but I won't lose myself for you. Then you don't love me. That's not true. I can't lose you, too! Don't! Stay with me, please! Are you all right? Luca always leaves. -Bee! No! No! -Let her go! Oh, my God! Don't let her do this! Bea, you can't control it! The Shred takes what it wants! You can... ...let yourself out of your own life! There's something wrong with Gabe. He's not in there anymore. Something is wrong with Gabe. What else is new? Oh, hello. I'm Bee. Come, baby. I think it's time for a tea party. The Shred is taking them all. He is going to wash us all away, and I'll be alone with all the memories. The truth is a heavy thing. But someone has to carry it, otherwise nothing means anything at all. You don't have to remember alone. I won't forget. You'll live with what you've done. Mother's story was supposed to keep us safe. We won't tell anyone. Come here now. Luca. It looks so ugly. You don't have to keep the ugly memories if you don't want to. But how would I know what to keep? Stop wearing your mask. You'll worry less. Evie will tell us what to remember. Just like Mother did. Out there are all things lost. In here are all things found. We will remember. This was once Mother, keeper of the past. She protected our stories, and died peacefully. The reign of her remembrance has come to an end. Her memories have passed to me. We will remember. We tell the story that reminds us who we are. I am Evie, the one-eyed queen. I am Luca, the one-eyed king. I am Bee, sister of Evie. I am Daisy, daughter of Bee. This is Gabe, brother of all. We honor our laws and all it needs. Never let a stranger enter the sanctuary. The sanctuary and all it holds, is sacred. Guard the memories we need to survive. We are the ones who never leave. As long as we remember, we remain. We will remember. And I do. Both the history we're repainted, and the past we've scraped away. Some of us do leave in body, or in mind. Bee has chosen oblivion. Soon she will be like Gabe. If the baby lives, I hope it will breathe outside without fear, as Luca does. Gabe reminds us of how much we have to lose. We play our parts, until we can not. Some day I too will be replaced. Our faces may change, but our names do not. Mother knew. I can't hold on to everything. Balance requires sacrifice. We must let go of past seasons to clear space for new seeds.
