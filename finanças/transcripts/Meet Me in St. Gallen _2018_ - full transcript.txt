(Meet me in St. Gallen) Ma’am... Ma’am, your phone is ringing. You should answer. It must be your boyfriend. Hello? Celeste, where are you? On the way home, on a taxi. Where exactly? We’re along Commonwealth now. Well, you haven’t gotten far yet. Get back here immediately. Ma’am, didn't you approve that already? Yes, but I have some revisions in mind. Ma'am, you could have told me before I got on a ride home. You are still on Commonwealth, right? You're not yet home. Come on, this is urgent! Fine, I’m going back. Sir, can you take me back? I’ll just pay you extra. Ma’am, can’t you see how slow we’ve been going? If we turn back, we’ll get stuck in traffic. Now, it will be my loss. I did say I will cover the cost. If you would? Ma'am, even if you pay extra, I'm still at a loss. If you want, you can pay for my boundary. What? Your taxi stinks! The nerve. I want this to be more dynamic. I want to shock the client with this presentation. Maybe you need a terrorist if you want to "shock". I heard that. You know, Celeste, you could have been good... but you don’t appreciate the opportunities I’m giving you. You’re too proud. You think I’m out to get you? I’m actually challenging you. I want you to be the best that you can be. No other company will hire you with that attitude. So just do your job. I have another meeting. I’ll be back in a couple of hours. I’ll check that later. All I want is for you to hear my voice It wakes with the light of morning The sun is setting When will I be heard? But I do not mind the darkness Because the stars shine at night A star A star I am a star I shine because I'm famous for another reason The truth is people treat me like a nobody But it's all right because I don't care I might be someone to look up to Or someone you're fed up with I maybe a little speckle in your eyes I’m the sun of my own world I understand my fate Even as I try to understand more, not everyone can reach the universe The gap is great, so he cannot be enlightened This is what I got into, so I need to accept it Yes, I accept I just wish to ask you Why is it when people see a star, it's fall will grant their wish? All I want is for you to hear my voice It wakes with the light of morning The sun is setting When will I be heard? But I do not mind the darkness Because the stars shine at night A star A star So that’s it? That’s what you call a song? Was that the band you were bragging about? You told me you’ll quit. You need to review. Your exams are next week! What? You'll fail Physiology and Anatomy again? Jesse. Your father is talking to you. I won’t flunk. There. We have an agreement. You’re not sinking into this low life of yours, okay? I’m ashamed of you. - You were not even good earlier. - Dad. What are you looking at? Hello? Celeste, where did you go? Why haven’t you finished your job? Ma’am, the computer crashed, that’s why I stepped out for a bit. I haven't eaten. I'll just eat first. I don’t believe you. You haven't done what I've asked you to do. Ma’am, even if you check, the file’s been corrupted. So I left because it's of no use. You never run out of excuses, do you? Ma'am, why would I make excuses? I even came back. I was on my way home. I am not making up excuses. I am telling you the truth. I could have been home by now, right, ma'am? What you're saying is impossible. No, ma’am, it is not impossible. because we’re in the Philippines. This is a third world country. Everything that could possibly go wrong has already gone wrong, okay? You're so good at talking, aren't you? You're so good at making excuses. You're full of explanations. What? What did you say? Well, dang. How can I not explain myself? I’ve been going on and on, but you are not listening to me. You keep on calling. How am I supposed to work on a corrupted file? Are you raising your voice at me? Yes, ma'am, because you don’t get it. We are going in circles. I am exhausted too! I want to go home! I don't like your tone. Apologise to me. Apologise? Me? Why? I won't apologise, ma'am. Do you have any idea what I do? I am a graphic artist. Artist. Do you know what that means? What are you talking about? You are an employee. You are being paid, by me, every month. Well, that is not how it works. I am an artist. What I mean is I want to be free. I need some room to be creative. I cannot always follow your orders. Because, honestly, ma'am your instructions are always so vague, entirely unhelpful and unimaginative. So forgive me, okay? Not a chance. This is not acceptable, ma’am. You have nothing to stand on. You talk big, but you haven't proven anything. - Ma’am, I quit. I resign. - What... I love my work, but I love myself more. Goodbye. Are you the only one with a company? No. Is my life over? No. How dare she... Hey, miss, why did you cut in line? - I just got here... - You saw that the line is long. - What the... - Maybe I was just passing by? I just happened to pass by? - You had to assume the worst? - You have no concern for elders. So I can’t stay? Do you own this place? - Heavy load. - I’ll carry them for you. Talked so much. I just stood there... Taxi! Taxi! It’s taken. Sir! - Sir, can you take me to Fairview? - That’s far. Well, we’re in Centris. I’ll pay you extra. - That's far. My route is Cubao-Makati. - Sir, please! NOB 322. You're dead meat later. Oh, shit! You have an umbrella! Don’t try anything stupid. I said don’t move. Are you following me? Are you a stalker? Miss, relax. I’m not following you. Really? - Hello? - Yes, hello, ma'am? - MMDA hotline? - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, I am filing a complaint. - You have a complaint? - That’s right. - Okay Is it a PUV? - Taxi. - What's the complaint, ma'am? Yes, smoke-belching and he also refuses passengers. What's the plate number? - Plate Number N-O-B 3-2-2. - Okay. - Two 2’s. - Yes, 2. - What’s the name? - Tarantula Taxi. - Tarantula? - Yes, right? What a douchebag! - A douchebag. - Your name, ma'am, please. Your name, ma'am. Just for the record, ma'am. You were asking for my name. Yes, ma'am. Your full name, please. For the record, ma'am. - Celeste. Celeste Francisco. - Okay, ma'am, thank you. - Thank you. I’ll follow it up, all right? - Okay. - Okay, ma'am. Thank you for calling. - Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you, Ma'am. What’s so funny? Hey! You wearing white, what’s so funny? Not only have you been tailing me, you’re also eavesdropping on my phone calls. Why? Miss, your voice is a little loud, so everyone can hear you. Sorry. That's not it. I saw you earlier. That’s right. You had a gig earlier. The one who was singing, and everyone booed. That was you, right? And then at the comfort room, you were there. At the taxi bay, you were there too. So that means you are following me. I see you everywhere I go. Are you following me? Are you a stalker? Miss. Why? Are you ashamed you’ve been found out? - I saw you. - I am not a stalker, miss. So what is your deal with me? Do I owe you something? Did my brother hook up with your sister? I know he’s an ass. - Is that it? - No. No. Then what’s your problem? - Nothing, relax. - Nothing? Okay. So you think I'm pretty, that’s why you’ve been following me? No? You think I’m ugly, then. No. No. What, then? What do you need from me? Why are you following me? Because I’m going to call the police. What did you plan to do to me? See, there's a lot of people. I’m going to call the police now. Miss, wait. I don't have any plans. - Relax. - Why were you following me? I just heard you at the restroom earlier. As if... As if you were talking to someone. Your boss, probably. So? Well, it’s rare to see people like that these days. Someone who speaks their mind. Who stands up for herself. Undaunted. A douchebag. I hate douchebags the most. So you reported the taxi driver? A douchebag too. In our world, there's two kind of people. Either they're the douchebags or I am. They can't blend together. I'd prefer if I was the douchebag. I’m happier. May I? Fine, it's okay. It seems... that you messed up earlier. You caught that. Was it that bad? Yes. No, you see... my parents came. I saw them in the audience. Well, they don't like what I'm doing. There. I got rattled. I panicked. I messed up. Excuses... What do you mean they don’t like it? I should be studying, reviewing. Med school. Okay. You were upset. So you were looking for someone to get your mind off it. You saw me. That's it? You, too, were upset earlier. Celeste. - Francisco. - Stalker. Katy Perry. In coffee shops, I’m Katy Perry. Jesse. - Jesse. - Abaya. - Jesse? - Abaya. Jesse Abaya. Celeste and Jesse Forever. Haven’t you seen that? It was already released. Was it good? It was cute. I enjoyed it. - Celeste and Jesse Forever. - Celeste and Jesse Forever. Celeste and Jesse Forever. Happy ending. Actually, no. No, they didn’t end up together. - Wow, spoiler. - Sorry! Why? Were you going to watch it? - You haven’t even heard of it. - Well, I won’t watch it now. Wow, so now it’s my fault? Don’t you have any friends? I do. Well, I was thinking of spending time alone today. Okay, I'll leave you alone. Sorry. Sorry. Someone's sitting at your table. And it’s pouring out there. For sure, the traffic's heavy. And it's flooded since we’re in Metro Manila. You'll be going home late. Do you want to go? I’ll just stay here. I have lots of friends. 800 on Facebook. I have 1,000. How embarrassing. You have more friends. I bragged about 800. Let’s not be like that. - Don't be like what? - Facebook friends. - I was going to add you. - Don’t. I don’t want that because think about it. What are the odds... of meeting a complete stranger in a coffee shop... who you can have a nice conversation with? Like this, face-to-face. An actual conversation. Right? Let’s stay this way. This is it. Let’s not be friends. What is this? Nothing. We met. We talked. Hi. Hello. Goodbye. No personal details? - No number? Things like that... - Personal details? So that's why you sat there. If you weren’t good-looking, I won't let you sit with me. Thanks. That helped. It really helped. It's hard to be ugly today. A lot of burdens. You sounded really judgmental. Judgmental? No. I’m just telling the truth. Do you always tell the truth? As much as I can. It’s true! When I was young, our viand for breakfast, lunch, dinner, for snacks, too, was pork. If you could drink pig’s blood, we probably would have. We were so fed up with pork that I started having nightmares involving pigs. This one dream I can’t forget. I was about 8 years old. Hold me. Right here, there’s a pig. Pretend you’re a pig. I’ll try to bolt. No! Let me go! Like that! Like that! Like that! How did you know? - I was the pig! I was the pig! - You're a stalker. You're a stalker. Like that. They ganged up on me and butchered me the same way we slaughtered them. And nobody helped me. Since then, I can't eat pork, up until now. You had a very dark childhood. But did you know that pigs have the longest orgasm? Yes. They can go on for 30 minutes. Thirty minutes? Wow. Nirvana. Makes you wish you were a pig, right? Excuse me. Why? Is that what you learn in med school? Is that what got you took up Medicine? Are you a vet med? I just read it on the internet. You read it on the internet after or before you watched porn? Yeah. Baby. - Hey, Celeste. - Why? Stop it. Hey! There are people around. It's embarrassing. You're a girl. No wonder your father’s angry with you. At night, you’re in a band. In the morning, you watch porn. Are you really a student? My dad’s angry with me... because he feels he knows what’s best for me. I don't want to be a doctor. I don’t see myself becoming a doctor. Me. Look at me. Do I look like someone who will be a doctor? I want.. I want to sing. I want to write songs. I want the world to feel my wrath. Wrath. I can see it. You are a true rock star! - All that hate! - Not just hate. - What? - I also want... to write songs about love. About the things I whisper to the sky when I’m alone. About heartbreak. What would the world be without love songs, Celeste? Here we go. Here’s your chance. You wanted to sing, right? - Let me handle it. Hey, there. - Not there, Celeste. - Yes? - Sir, can we try out the mic? Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, but we’re closed. - I'm sorry. Try tomorrow. - It's closed. - It's closed. - Leave it to me. Too bad because my friend here’s a rich kid. He’s considering buying one of these. - Oh, he’s buying? - Yes. Oh, I was actually doing overtime. - Try this one. - You’re the best! - Yes, ma’am. - He’ll buy this, I swear. - Okay, ma’am. I hope he’ll buy a lot. - How does this work? - How many numbers should I press? - Just click on the buttons. Five... Five numbers. One, two... Hurry! Hurry! There it is! Quick, hold it! What a nice song! Sir, let’s give it up for Jesse! Yes! I’ll take a video of you. We’ll post it. Sing. Oh, you. I helped you out. Hurry up! Can you see yourself? I was mistaken So I hung my head and cried You're fooling me. You are my sunshine My only sunshine You make me happy When skies are grey You never know, dear How much I love you What are you doing? Please don't take my sunshine away - Taxi, sir? - Yes. Thank you. - You’re really leaving now? - Yeah. I’ll walk you home. - I’ll walk you home. - Don't. You’ll find out where I live. Then you’ll really come after me. - You’re really confident about that. - Yes. You don’t have work tomorrow. You’re out of a job. Yes, but I have a lot to do. I have a lot of laundry. It’s a huge pile. - I’ll do your laundry. - You already love me that much? - You’re too much. - Come on, let’s go! Let’s go for drinks. Talk more. - Me, you... - Sex? Well... Well! Well! Well! Where to now? - There. - There. Gemini! Wrong! Scorpio. - Gemini! - I'm a Scorpio! This is all we have. One. You have no other chance. Just do everything. Be happy. Let’s give it life. The what? Life! Life into life! Here. Let’s clap our hands. My aunt’s very pretty and kind too. But she doesn’t have a boyfriend. She doesn’t have a boyfriend. She doesn’t have a husband and she doesn’t have a baby. She’s looking? She’s looking? Not really, but she’s been wondering why there isn’t one. Why am I like this? Why am I alone? So when she turned 38, she decided, she said... “Why don’t I consult a fortune-teller?” A fortune teller? What’s surprising about that? She went to see a fortune teller. She walked like this... She got to her car and she drove to the fortune teller. When she arrived, she said, “Excuse me?" - “Madam?” - Madam! “Do I still have a chance at love? I’m so old. Is 'The One' coming?” And the fortune teller replied, “You still have a chance, girl. He'll come when you turn 40. You just need to be open.” When she got back home, my aunt changed. She used to be very strict. She became friendly. She's always smiling, and she became open to everything, open to the world and to every possibility. Someone courted her. A sea man. Kind, kind of handsome, but he’s just a little old. Then she said, “We should get married.” Because my aunt's 38, and the man is old enough for them to wed immediately. And so the wedding came to be. - Here. Here. Here. - Wow! - You'll be surprised. - Happy ending. - Happy ending, right? - Yes! Here's the kicker. When my aunt turned 40, the doorbell rang. Who was it? My aunt's boyfriend from high school. Her true love. Her true love. No reason. Her true love. Her true love. Crazy, right? He came when she turned 40. Didn't the fortune teller said when she turned 40? And my aunt said, “Wait here. I’ll be right back.” She drove back to the fortune teller in a hurry, utterly furious. Guess what she did. No, none of that. Just quarrelled with her. - Quarrelled. - She said, “You! You! You said if I opened my heart, I’ll receive the blessings. Then I opened it and I did receive them! But now I’ve turned 40, my true love has come along. Then, what now? I already have a husband!” The fortune teller said, “You misunderstood me. I told you to wait till you turn 40. You were still 38 and you let all the blessings in.” - My aunt was... “You were too impatient.” You're too impatient like champorado. My aunt was shocked. She's stunned. She said... But this is where I get confused. Why did he show up? Does that mean my aunt was destined to have two lovers? - And why... - She shouldn’t had a reading. What should she have done? That's it. She should have just let life run its course. If the future can be foretold, then it’s destiny! So you believe in destiny? I don’t believe in reincarnation. But in destiny, I do. Really? Why? No. Not quite. Like that... Because there are things... that go together. It goes together whatever situation it is. But as rational beings, I’d like to believe that... that we have our own decisions with happens with our lives. So what you mean to say is like you’ll keep believing in something until you no longer do? Like that? Until something new comes along? Isn’t it possible... to change your opinion on something - depending on the situation? - No! No! That’s not good because-- You can’t believe in something just because it’s there. Because if that is so, that means it's just a convenience? You’re just desperate to believe in something, so you go along with it. - Compromise. - No. Compromise is tantamount to sacrifice. You have something important to you... you love him, but I'll let you go to secure something else. because that's compromise. So what kind of person does that make you if you don't have... conviction? You don’t believe in anything. Are you even human? Even I don’t like compromise. - Then why did you say compromise? - Because there is no absolute, either. There's no certainty, right? The only thing that exists... is how I feel... about what I believe in that moment. That’s what I can hold on to. That's it. I don’t like this conversation. It became sad all of a sudden. Are you bored? - No. No. - You're bored. - What are you doing there? - I’m taking care of something. Hey! I thought we weren’t going to be Facebook friends? Yes... - That's me. See? - Oh, my God, no. - Let me see. Let me see. It is. - It’s not you. It’s a different Jesse. The world’s full of Jesse’s. Besides... it’s a force of habit. If I hadn’t caught you, you would have added me. No! You’re so full of yourself. Celeste. Thank you. What for? You know that... What? That feeling when you look upon nothingness... but you’re not sure about... what you’re supposed to feel. You search for that... that feeling. Because you know that once you find it... everything else will come easy. Everything that you can do. Everything impossible will become possible. You came, Celeste. Thank you. For what? Because you're here. You’re making me cry! Why am I crying? Why am I crying? You said we’ll drink. Why did you make me cry? I think we’re drunk. You know, when I’m old... feeble, then, hopefully, not senile... I’ll keep thinking back to this night. And I’ll wonder... why I didn’t even get to... why I didn’t even get to kiss you. Would you like to kiss me? Have you ever fallen in love? True love. That you don’t know what to do, you don’t know what to feel and you can’t breathe. Whenever you think of that person, your stomach drops. You know? You don’t know what you’re capable of because you’re scared. But, at the same time, you want to do everything... because you’re in love. Have you ever felt that way? I wish... in my lifetime... I want to experience that kind of love. What a perfect moment this is. Let’s not ruin it. Celeste and Jesse forever and ever. (After 4 years...) Hi, good afternoon. One tall brewed coffee for Katy Perry. One tall brewed coffee for Katy Perry. - Celeste! - Thank you. Hi, Katy Perry. - Do you remember me? - Of course. Jesse. Jesse the rock star. - Jesse the doctor. - Wow, really? - Okay. - Veterinarian. Something good came out of our chat about pigs. - Orgasms. - Orgasms. - Are you with someone? - No. I’m just preparing for a meeting. Can I join you? Just coffee. Promise. Sure. Sure, doc. Okay. Hello again. How have you been? I’m good. What’s your meeting about? With a friend. - Boyfriend. - No, girlfriend. - Girlfriend. - I mean... Sorry. A female friend. You look like you’re doing well. Really? So do you. You look well. You’re not in a band anymore? Not anymore. I got tired of it eventually. I still play, but mostly lullabies for dogs and cats. Things don’t really turn out the way you planned them. - But it seems fine. - Okay. Am I still handsome? Do you still think I’m handsome, that’s why you let me sit with you? Yeah, lucky you. One tall Americano for Brad Pitt. Oh, my God. You're not that handsome. - Very handsome? - You have an edge. You never looked for me? Facebook. Instagram. Well, didn't you say not to ruin it? So I didn’t. Wait. Yes, I looked at your account. I looked at your profile. There! Look at that. I stopped. I stopped when you got a girlfriend. I stopped looking. Why? - Nothing. Stop asking. - Why? Nothing! Oh, you. Well, it's annoying. I don't want to look. Too lovey-dovey. Too lovey-dovey. Borderline gross. You know, I never took you for a person who needs affirmation from social media. You’re the one who kept coming back to my profile page. Well, isn’t that seeking some kind of affirmation? Well, that’s why I stopped. I stopped. But... for what it’s worth... it took me a long time before I could forget about... the kiss. You should. Was I your... - your first kiss? - No. No. No. - I think it's me. - No. You're irritating. - It’s okay, you can tell me. - It really wasn’t. - Oh, you're unbelievable. - I am, right? But isn't it... people say your first kiss is life-changing. Sure. If it’s the first kiss, but it wasn't. Okay! Okay. Fine. You said so. Do you still live in Fairview? Oh, my God. Sorry. Yes. The.. I'm shocked. The... My family went back to the province, so there. But I'm with my brother. He's here with his own family. But at our old home, it’s just me. And I modified the entire house to be a studio. You? I’m still staying at my parents... but the angst is gone. - The recklessness of your youth is gone? - Gone. But I bought a condo in Ortigas. With Diana. We’ll live there after the wedding. Wedding? Wow. Really? - You’re engaged now? - Yes. Oh, right, because you told me you don’t want to grow old alone. Sorry. Sorry. I shouldn’t have... Sorry. It’s fine. It’s fine. I did say that before. But I couldn’t help it. I fell in love. Oh, my gosh. Sorry. I am so late. I’ll go ahead. I need to leave you because I have to go... Really? Thank you. Celeste, can we be friends this time? - Yes. Facebook friends. - Facebook friends. - Are they still together? - Wait, look. They're engaged. There's a ring, and it’s beautiful. The girl is beautiful. Take a look. She wasn’t that pretty before, right? He looks happy. He’s not fucked up Jesse anymore. Then he asked me if we can be friends. - So what did you say? - Okay, Facebook friends. Don’t lie. Why did he have to show up again? I was doing so well. You know, it's physics. Everything is energy, right? Jesse was the one person that never left your mind. Ever. Think about it. All the thoughts you ever had of him... He’s your ideal man. He's the one who's always there. You set him up in your mind. All his being. All these years, you were wondering, what could have been if only you didn’t dilly-dally. So all these Jesse thoughts are linked to this invisible frequent energy. Atom by atom are manifested into a reality. Maybe it’s destiny. If you still believe in that. - He does look very handsome. - And he’s staring at me. - He’s got great eyes. - Why does he got to be like that? If you only know When we will cross paths again Is this about that night? Were you waiting long? This is me. It’s about me. It’s my shirt. I still have this shirt. Because... You keep showing up suddenly. You never told me you’re an accomplished artist now. I’m not accomplished. This is my first. I thought I was going to die on opening. Don’t die just yet. Savour this. You’re on your way to greatness. Greatness. Adored. In denial. "Memories long gone, but remain with you. Only fragments of the past remain." Interesting. At least... I’m one of the people you missed. I hope I’m a beautiful memory. Does it hurt? I guess that’s just who I am. I always fall for assholes. But I don't want that now. I don’t want another intense relationship. I made many of paintings out of that painful relationship. Three years. Three years on and off. An intense three years. - Intense? - Intense. Never again. But don't you want that? You're able to turn a bad thing good. And, besides, isn't all of this... the experience of a person who wants to share his feelings with the world? It’s a way to live with himself. Good boy You're so good I hope Lord takes you - Doc! Doc! - King! How are you? - How are you? - You haven’t been here in a while. Yeah, I miss it! I reserved a table for you. Hurry. Go over there. Good boy Good boy You're so good I hope Lord takes you - You’re laughing at it, not having fun. - Not quite. It’s fun too. - That’s it? - Yes. Thank you. What if you kept going at it? You know... "What if"... is one the hardest questions. Because there are many... many variables. A lot of... factors that can happen, unless... there really is a parallel universe. But... only one thing can happen. That which already did. Why did you... Why did you... give up? We got duped by our manager. Then after that... the band had a falling out. Diana and I were already dating at the time. So she's the same with dad, they both said nothing will change if I stay in the band. It came to the point where I wouldn’t come home, I’d sleep at anyone’s house. It's a mix of alcohol... sex, drugs, During that time, Diana left me. Perhaps that was my wake-up call. After a few weeks... I begged her. She took me back. I came back home to Dad. Was it passion that slipped away? Or maybe I just got tired? Or I knew myself better. I accepted it more. This is who I am. I am a product of my choices... and my actions. Like you. Don't you have any... Don’t you have regrets? Useless. Yes, it’s just as you said... "we all have to find a way to live with ourselves." Smile. It’s too early. You’ll get ugly. Excuse me. Respiratory rate? Irregular breathing. - Is he vomiting? - Yes, Doc. Okay, not good. Okay, Mike. I’m almost there anyway. I’ll meet you there. Thank you. Doc. Hello. - Is everything ready? - We’re ready. Lucy, I’ll take care of Coco, okay? - Go with Celeste for now. - No, I want Coco. - Hi, Lucy. - Go on. I’m Celeste. Come here. Come with me. It’s okay. Let’s go sit over here. Lucy, come sit with me. There. Very good. Sit there. You think Coco’s gonna die? No. No, I don’t think Coco’s gonna die. You know why? Because Doc Jesse’s a very, very good doctor. Yeah, I like him. He gives Coco treats and he loves to play with Coco. - And he loves Coco. - Yeah, he does. He loves Coco. So, you know what, Coco will get better immediately. So smile already. See? You have a pretty smile! Come over here. Let’s wait for Coco right here. Lucy? Coco’s fine now. You can go see him. - Wow! - Yeah! Lucy? You forgot something. Thank you, Doc Jesse! Let’s go. Let’s go. Let’s go. Thank you. I am proud of you earlier. What kind of coffee is this? This is also me. May I see? Maybe you have more. - No! No. - Let me see. - Please? - Nothing! Nothing! What else do you want to do? Many things, of course. You can’t just stop dreaming. I applied at Cooper Union. Cooper Union. - Where’s that? - Art school. In New York. I’m reaching for the moon, but you never know. I want to study again. Then? Then, I want to travel. I want to... travel around the world. Experience everything. Anything, you know. Whatever goes. - Take me with you? - Ass. Take me with you! - No. - Do you want me to go with you? - No. - Why? I want to do it alone. Also... I want to go to a Christmas Village. On Christmas. Snow will be falling. - Have you ever seen snow? - Great. - Where? - I don’t know. Why do you want to be alone? Why do you want to be lonely? Lonely and alone are different. Solitude is different from loneliness. Solitude is when... you’re quiet by yourself... but completely fine. No matter, I’ll come with you. You know me... I’m the same girl. You're... you’re a better Jesse. Take care. (2 years later) Hi, Marcus. What should I try today? Okay! Hello. Good morning. Can I have one coffee, please? Excuse me, can you make that two? Sorry. Hello? Celeste? Okay. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. What are you doing here? Didn't... Didn't I tell you I’ll come with you? I just arrived. It’s freezing! Why do you like it in this cold? How about we go someplace warm? Let's have coffee. Why did you come here? I’m sorry, did I surprise you? I don’t know how to start. We’re always starting out. But now I know, I can’t just leave this to anything. To destiny or something else. You left Diana? Didn’t you get married? We didn’t. I didn't go through with it. You thought... that when you show up out of the blue, I would be okay with it? That I would just be here, waiting. And that since you changed your life, I would change mine too? Do you know what I prayed for? I said... it was only now that my mind and heart were in agreement. So I hope it's right. I pray they both get their wish. What about you? You don’t need to say everything. It’s enough that you let me be. Even though I know you’d rather be on your own. Solitude is different from loneliness. Yup. I did say that. You hurt Diana for me? Do you realise how cruel that was? You're not an ass. - I am an ass. - You’re not. - You’re not an ass. - I am, Celeste. You only think I’m not. Don’t make me your ideal man. Make me a human being, please. I am not some painting you hang on a wall. I want to be with you. I want to talk to you. I want to kiss you again that’s why I came here. I don’t expect you to change your life for me. - I would never... - But that’s the problem! Whatever you do... whatever you say, you always say the right words. And then what? One look and one smile. Everything’s fine, right? And I’m the one who's wrong. I have a boyfriend. Tobias is from here. We met in Budapest. He’s a painter. And I like him a lot, Jesse. He must be home by now. I have to go. I’m sorry. - Celeste... - No, I have to go... Celeste. Can we talk? That's it. Hello? Yeah. I’m... I’m walking with a friend. No, I’m okay. I’m okay. Yeah. I’m on my way home. I’ll try to invite him. Yeah, I’ll try to invite him. Okay. I will. Yeah, I’ll see you in a bit. Yeah. Bye. Bye. Bye. You know, I tried to write you a song. You’re singing again? Gosh. But it was only a try. Why? It's not nice? No words came out. - I couldn’t write anything. - Why? I felt maybe I had to see you again. Before everything comes out... The lyrics, the melody. The way they did when I met you. Gosh! Don't! Stop there. Don’t go that. You never recover from me whenever we meet, right? Then you disappear for years on end. - That’s true. - And pop up out of nowhere. Let’s not go there. Maybe I’m not your muse. Haven't you thought of that? But you... - are my sunshine. - Wow! - You are my sunshine - How did we dance to this back then? My only sunshine You make me happy when skies are grey You'll never know, dear, how much I love you Please don’t take my sunshine away Thank you. Thank you, St. Gallen! There. That's enough. That's enough We’re going to an exhibit in Basel next week. Then we’ll be back for the New Year’s. Why don’t you bring him to the Philippines? So he can be warm. Actually, he did ask me to, so... So I might bring him next summer. Do you love him? But not in the way I used to think love had to be. The one I was talking about. Violently passionate that can do anything. No. It's different now. It’s more comfortable. It's in the little things now. It's... when he wraps his arms around me or... how he stops my tears. It's more like that. Perhaps I’ve matured. My heart has calmed down. What could I do to make you mine? You were right. I... I made you my ideal man. So you cannot hurt me. Because my Jesse always makes me smile. You came in my life. And I was never the same. Maybe this is all we are. Just passing by. Never to stay. Never to stay. Maybe we came to... make each other happier? Maybe... maybe we came to... to give a little life into life. You don’t break hearts on Christmas. That's not allowed. - That's not allowed. - That's not allowed. Hey, Celeste. Come inside. Coming. It's so cold! What about your friend? - He made plans. Yeah. - Okay. Let’s go, let’s go. Come in, come in. It’s cold! - It’s very cold! Up the stairs. - Yeah. - Are they upstairs? Okay. - Yes, they are. Are you still coming to Basel with me? Of course.
