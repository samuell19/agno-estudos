TOHO COMPANY, LTD. A KATSU PRODUCTION NORTH MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE The oath. Take no bribes. Don't abuse your authority. Hate the crime, not the criminal. Remember your sphere of activities and your duties. Do not compromise authority. Those who break this oath will be punished by the gods. I, Magobei Onishi, chief officer, swear this oath. - I swear this oath. - I swear this oath. Next, Officer Hanzo Itami. Hanzo. Don't you hear me? I do. I know this is only a formality, but I can't betray myself and seal the oath in blood. Please go on. You. You say our oath is only a formality? An insult! Inexcusable! You say you can't swear the oath if you have to betray yourself- That means you abuse your authority and take bribes. Absolutely not. But this office receives gifts from the retainers of the daimyo who hope to avoid trouble with us. This is a fact. It's also a fact that the brothels and tradesmen send gifts. I'm a member of this office, and although I do not receive any of the actual money, I may be under obligation in some way. So I refuse the oath. What is a bribe, Officer Onishi? Being lenient for a sum? Because of bribery, we've become too lenient. We overlook violent samurai. We shut our eyes to what goes on in the Yoshiwara brothels. We don't arrest many tradesmen either. Watch your mouth, Hanzo. Don't argue. Talking back to your superior? Insolence! Simmer down and listen! Our duty's not to protect the samurai, the rich, or Yoshiwara. We should protect the millions of Edo townsmen and farmers. Put that in writing before making us take an oath. Then I'll seal it with the blood of my entrails. - You! - Hanzo, you're - Calm down. Hanzo Itami. How many years have you been an officer? Four years. You've never taken this oath? The first year he was sick. The next year he was on duty. The third year he was sick again. And this year he finally shows up and does this. I am sorry. Up to something? If you've got anything to say, out with it. We keep peace and order in Edo. But there are too many things to block us. Starting with the retainers, the temple, and the finance magistrates, they all say they're not under our jurisdiction, and won't let us investigate. Innumerable suspects escape us because of it. It's impossible to keep law and order. The matter urgently needs correcting rather than stupid oaths. To justify this corruption with an oath is a rather foolish act. It's like asking us to abandon our jobs as officers of the law. I admit it's a regrettable thing. But that's the government's problem. We can do nothing about it. Be reasonable. No, sir. I cannot set my blood seal to such an oath. Please permit me to carry out my duties as a real lawman. Please take my request into consideration. HANZO THE RAZOR: SWORD OFJ USTICE Put it on. - Master. - Are you all right? Put more on. But - I said put more on. Hurry. Take your hands away... fools. Master! Put it on. - It'll break your bones! - Please stop! Never mind. One more. Devil-fire. Viper. Roll up the sleeve on your left arm. Again? Just do what I say and tell me what you used to be. Tell me. - I was a thief. - That's right. And you? Let me off, Master. So you're not going to say it? I kidnapped girls to sell them. Who made it possible for you to walk the streets as free men? Our lives are yours. That's clear. Do as I say then. Put it on. Master. Master. I'm not done yet. Hanzo. Are you out of your mind? On your rounds? What's the idea? As you can see, I'm torturing myself. Stop it. Take them off. - Don't touch them. - Hanzo, you - A member of the magistrate's office undergoing torture! What's the meaning of this? I didn't think I'd hear those words from you, Chief. What? We're filthy lawmen who handle criminals. That's why we can't even meet the Shogun. So I don't see anything wrong... in testing myself by torture. Testing? Chief Onishi. We ourselves should know the pains of the criminals we torture. After people are tortured beyond the limit of human endurance, they enter a sort of world like Shangri-La. So we must find the limit that's most effective in torturing men. Take them off. Hurry! How did you get these scars? I hung upside down and went through the water and basket tortures. I was lashed, stripped naked, and underwent severe torture. It seems to erect when in pain like when it's all tired out. We're too busy for these things. Hanzo, we're going to round up vagrants today. You'll go too. I'm an officer. That's not my job. Don't complain. We don't have enough men. Everybody takes part in today's roundup. - I refuse. - What? Think you can get away with refusing your superior? It'll be December soon. You don't mind being fired next year? Always bragging of your position. Why don't you look me in the face when you talk? Fire me if you can! Onishi, do you know what your nickname is? It's Snake Magobei, idiot! That's no way to talk to your chief. We can't continue to work unless we get your consent at the year's end. Taking advantage of it, you force us to give you gifts and line your own pockets. We fawn on you so you won't hate us. You're Snake Magobei! I let you talk and... Want to? I'm telling you our duties. Rounding up vagrants isn't really our work. Plus, we're off-duty. It doesn't make sense! You forget your position. I'll settle this once and for all. I don't understand. Why get worked up about vagrants? Something's behind it. If we don't keep Onishi under control, we'll end up getting the ax. Check on him. Watch him around the clock. Report everything. - We'll do that. - If I'm fired, so are you. We know. All men, high or low, have a skeleton or two in their closet.

Don't resist! Damn it! I won't give in! Out of my way! Serves you right, assholes. Move aside! Help me, master! I don't want to be sent to Tsukuda Island! Spare me. I've got hot news. Kanbei escaped from his island. Your name? I'm Sanji. He's dead. Well? His nose is crushed, but he'll be fine in a month. You're cruel to break my nose. What if I become ugly? It'll heal soon. Now you'll look tougher. Or is being sent up for four years better than being in pain for a month? No, of course not. I'm indebted to you. What about Kanbei? Tell me the rest. Last year- It's about Killer Kanbei caught last year and banished to an island. I found it. Kanbei Harada also known as Killer Kanbei, 42. He contracted killings for money? Yes, a former Bizen Clan samurai, he uses the Batto style of swordplay. He ran a school in Shitaya and had five or six pupils. As a suspect, he was tortured in every way but didn't confess. - Quiet. - I'm sorry. Incorrigible. They couldn't get proof, so they banished him for blackmail. Even though there is no proof or confession, there must be a reason why people call him Killer Kanbei. There must've been another way to interrogate him. Yet they didn't execute him but banished him in a hurry. Something's not right. The officers? Officer Aizawa caught him. Chief Onishi handled the case. Onishi? I have a friend named He... Hed... Hide. He said he saw Kanbei a few days ago. What? Hide's a pick- a pickpocket. He used to live near his fencing school, so he recognized him. By the way he limped, he's sure it was Kanbei. Did he say who the woman was or what her name was? You know what? She has no hair where she should. All smooth. Smooth? What did you just say? A beautiful woman with no hair there, all white. Sorry. Except that, Hide didn't find out her name or who she is. No good would come of being found out and getting killed by Kanbei. Master. Onishi has a mistress. He sees her secretly. She's irresistible. I want to do her too. Onishi, the lucky dog! She has no hair there. What? Not a single hair. It's her. No mistake. She's my trump card. Get the woman. How awful! Submit to the law! Not me. When I came home, he was already dead. We got a report someone screamed here! No. I didn't do it. Explain at the office. Come on. No. What are you doing? Let me go. Where are you taking me? That's the way to the river. - You'll be questioned there. - What? We've got a special technique to make you confess. What? Here comes the police boat. What are you doing? Damn it! Stop it! You call yourselves officers of the law? What are you doing to me? What are you doing? Damn it. What do you intend to do with me? A few questions. Don't you know who I am? I have many friends. You'll pay for this. An officer. You'll be fired. I know you're Onishi's kept woman. What're you - Shall I walk you home? Or should you walk me home? At least we can walk together To the corner of the street No. Don't stop. You're so virile. Omino, you're Kanbei's woman, aren't you? I don't know - I don't know anyone by that name. You mean you aren't? Don't. Don't stop. How about it? I was, a long time ago. You still are. Somebody saw you together. No. What's wrong? Please. Please kill me. He was banished to Hachijo Island. Why is he back? No boats have gone to release anybody for three years, and there are no reports that a criminal's escaped. And Kanbei's woman is Onishi's mistress now. What's going on? Please. I beg you to. Confess. And you'll be in heaven. Kanbei - Kanbei wasn't banished at all. Hurry. I'll tell all. Tell me everything. Nothing to hide. We're both naked. I have a lot of enemies, so I have these. Have to be pretty smart to leave here in one piece. And I have three men guarding the place, so don't worry. Confess everything. You're in my charge. This makes it easier to talk? Right after Kanbei was caught... What's this? A living doll and 500 gold pieces. Not a bad deal. Spare Killer Kanbei, the man you arrested. What's that? We need Kanbei. Please make an exception for him. I can't do that. We've been after him for a year. You refuse? But I'm an officer, and to break the law - Kofu is very cold in winter, isn't it? Since you're such a conscientious officer, you won't mind being transferred there, will you? Wait. Are you sure they threatened to send him to Kofu? No idea who they are? Both their faces were hidden and it was so sudden. They ordered me to cooperate in saving the man I loved. You were taken to Onishi's place? One was a middle-aged man, the other a woman. And four or five masterless samurai. Chief Onishi's an officer of the North Magistrate's Office. No ordinary person can send him to Kofu. You're in charge of rounding up vagrants. Pick a man resembling Kanbei. Give him money and make him agree to serve a couple of years. Send him to Hachijo Island. That should be easy for you to do. Substitute the man for Kanbei while you conduct an investigation. To request such a thing from an officer of the law takes a great deal of determination. So if you refuse - I haven't said that. You agree then? Don't worry, even if you are found out. We can pressure the magistrate, even the elders, and hush it up. He said he could even pressure men like that? Someone in the Inner Castle. Omino. Did she talk like a lady-in-waiting? Now that you mention it... I meant to get Onishi, but I'm onto something monstrous. What do they have to do with Kanbei? Something big's behind this. I'll hand you over to Onishi. What? A man was found dead in your home. I'll hand you over as the suspect. That's - We're up against the elders or the inner castle. It's all or nothing now. It'll be the biggest match of Razor Hanzo's life. Omino was arrested. They found a dead man in her home, so... Something's fishy. The officers? Devil-fire Seikichi and Viper Genju are on the case. So that means - Razor Hanzo? If he's involved, I guess the corpse was planted there as an excuse to arrest her. Razor Hanzo? I don't know what he's found out, but we must get rid of him before things get serious. - Officer Yamawaki's arrived. - All right. Thanks for coming. What is it so early in the day? Off duty? - So I'm sleepy. - Sorry. A few questions. Yamawaki. You know all about the Inner Castle, since you're in charge of food there. What's it to you? I'm not free to talk. Don't say that. We're childhood chums. What woman there... can move the magistrate or an elder? And have the chief officer sent to Kofu? Lady Oraku, I think. Not only is she the mother of Lord Nishinomaru, but she's a great favorite of the Shogun. Who can work on her and get her to take such an action? What're you up to, Hanzo? Don't worry about it. It doesn't concern you. Just answer me. There's no such person. Is there? No one has that much power, but there's someone she especially favors. Lady Oraku just might listen to what that person says. Who is it? Oyura and her father, Dr. Genpaku Inamura. Once every three days, she sees Lady Oraku and acts as her companion. Only a doctor's daughter? Don't get the wrong idea about her. Unlike old ladies-in-waiting, Lady Oraku has no lesbian tendencies. Genpaku and Oyura? There were strange rumors about her a year ago. A year ago? Iga spies guarding the inner castle tried to kidnap her but they disappeared instead. They were probably killed. If her bodyguard killed them, he must be even stronger than Iga spies. But why would someone like that be guarding Oyura? Just rumors, I presume. No, they're not just rumors. Lady Oraku took care... that they'd only seem to be rumors. Who are you? What're you doing? Master. Kanbei killed the Iga spies. No mistake. Stay out of it, Yamawaki. Devil-fire. Viper. Kanbei's found out. Smart to come disguised as firefighters. NORTH MAGISTRATE'S OFFICE Hey, isn't that Razor Hanzo? Yes. He's very strong, and so is his thing. - What thing? - The thing under his loincloth. Stop it! That hanging part of his body? The vulnerable spot? - You mean his balls? - What are you saying? - The other thing! - Imagining things. Pig! You're awful! - Your face is awful! - Like yours! - You're one to talk! - Anyway, is it that big? A size larger with big warts. He's more than a widow-killer, a courtesan-killer. - Ever seen it? - Yes, with Kihachi. I saw him in the summer washing himself in a tub and - What? Counting prayer beads? I know! Omino killed Minokichi. Wanted as a vagrant, he ran into her house and stole money. Then he tried to assault her but was killed by Omino instead. Minokichi's body? - I cremated him after the inspection. - Fast work. Arrest papers, please. Did Omino confess? She seems deathly afraid and won't talk. I'll make her confess at Denmacho jail. Is it really safe? Don't get upset. Just do as I say. Master. Hanzo? He's searching for something. Master, save me! I didn't do anything. There was a body when I came home. - You say anything? - I wouldn't dare say a word to him. I've been falsely accused. Hurry. Save me. You really didn't talk? I thought you'd come to rescue me, so I held out. - I see. - Master. I will save you, so do as I tell you. You'll be taken to Denmacho. I'll have you tied loosely. So jump into the river from the bridge. I can't. Don't worry. Kanbei will save you in a boat. It's all I can do for you. Understand? I can't swim. Don't worry. Kanbei will be there. Master. You'll come with me, won't you? Yes, I will. Officer Onishi. You're going along with her? Yes. I have to see the magistrate. I see. It hurts. Wait a minute. Wait. Let her rest a while. She's escaping. Follow her. Hurry, fools. Don't let her escape. She can't swim. It must be cold in the river. - Did you kill her? - You take care of the rest. There will be no proof if Omino dies and Hanzo disappears. It's not that simple. You're Killer Kanbei? You've finally appeared. Razor Hanzo. What are you nosing around for? Why dig up the past? To live. I'm only an officer, so I must do this in order to live. It's all over if you die here. You'll end up the same anyway. You and Omino must die. I'll try my luck. A man's gotta gamble. You were banished anyway. Nobody cares if I kill you. You helped Oyura and got rid of the Iga spies? Just as I thought. Shouldn't we weigh him down with stones and sink him in the sea? And can I have Omino? What? Kanbei's woman became your mistress. Now, she'll become mine. So we're brothers of sorts. As long as I have her, you'll be kind to your younger brother? I'm counting on you. Well... Who are you? You don't even take your shoes off? Where do you think you are? Genpaku's place. I'm an officer. Where's Oyura's room? You can't enter freely here! Want to lose an ear? Intruder! Who are you? What impertinence! I see. You've got a lot of spirit for a doctor's daughter. Fool. Entering a lady's room without permission. Hanzo Itami of the magistrate's office. Oyura, daughter of Dr. Genpaku Inamura. I arrest you for harboring Kanbei and his men. That's why I'm here. So don't resist arrest! You came to arrest me? Who do you think I am? I'm favored by Lady Oraku and have permission to go to the Castle. Coming here without permission and accusing me falsely. What will the consequences be? Not only will you die, but the North Magistrate must also die. You don't mind that? Wretch! You can't come here! Begone! Quiet! I don't care whether it's under our jurisdiction or not! If it's in Edo, I go anywhere. What's a doctor's home? I'll get in touch with the magistrate and have you executed. That's all right with you? Hara-kiri hurts, you know. I've already cut mine. Look. I stopped the blood and bandaged my stomach to keep in my entrails. Take a good look at it. Oyura, Kanbei's dead. Onishi confessed and I have Omino. I've checked up on you! It's a big case that will go all the way to the Castle. That's why I've already cut my stomach open! I'm ready to die! Oyura. I'm arresting you. Ready? Where am I? My place. You didn't cut it? I fixed it up with dog's blood. You fooled me? You! What are you doing? Wretch! What're you doing? Scum! Wretch! Let me go! That hurts! Let go of me! I'll have you all beheaded! What are you doing? Oyura, what's between you and Lady Oraku? Don't stop. Please don't stop. What's the secret? I have a tattoo on my body. You'll see in the bath. Powder tattoo? Stand up. A love letter? "To Ichinojo" I see now. I'm free to come and go, so she uses my body to write letters. Then when she is off-duty, she sees Ichinojo, the actor. To think that a petty officer can become a figure at the inner castle. Master, the magistrate! He's on his way here! Where's Dr. Inamura's daughter? You broke into his home and - Are you safe? What is it, Father? I'm going to stay here from now on. I have Lady Oraku's permission. What happened, Magistrate? There's no case. No one was murdered or robbed. Everything's peaceful and quiet. Your order. NOODLES One for me. Not that, sake. Sis. Hurry! I've got money. - You don't mind if it's hard liquor? - Anything! Sis. One more. So young and - - Give it to me! - All right. Sis! I'm all right. Let's hurry. Here's your money. No, you needn't pay. Don't be rude. No, I didn't mean to be rude. Kill me! Kill me! Father! Father! I'll make it easier for you this time! Look the other way. Don't turn around. Father! I'll do it, Sis! Fool! Sis! You'll be dragged around, then crucified as punishment Kill me! I'm in pain. Father! Yes, you'd be crucified. Then your father wouldn't be able to rest in peace. I'm an officer- I know. I see. What can we do then? He'll live only about a month more. The doctor said so. He won't recover. He'll suffer a month and still die. I'm sorry for him. The least I can do is kill him to put him out of his misery. You'll be killed too. Even if I'm crucified, I'll do it. Why does she have to be crucified? It's patricide. I know how you feel. It's natural since you love him. But it's patricide. You'd be crucified. The law is merciless. So I ask you not to do it. Stop it! I've got myself in trouble. If I leave, she'll kill him. But I can't keep my eye on her all the time. Do you know my place, son? At Hatchobori? That's right. Go there and tell them I said to bring Dr. Inamura here. Does he bleed when he has a bowel movement? Yes, for a long time. I used an imported sedative, so he's not in pain now. The pain will come back, but I can use it only once. In his condition, he'd die if I used it again. Hopeless. There's a tumor in his stomach. A terminal disease. A month at best. It's hopeless? No mistake. I see. I'm leaving. Listen, you two. Go outside. Don't come in until I say so. All right. Come in. Father! Call the landlord. Say he hanged himself. The doctor gave him only a month? In pain? Yes. So he hanged himself? It's terrible to live in pain. Better off dead. Yes, it is. Investigation over. You report it. Yes. Thank you. It'll be December soon. You don't mind being fired next year? She uses my body to write letters. But that's the government's problem. Be reasonable. Kanbei wasn't banished at all. I'll tell all. He glares His eyes full of anger The veins in his temples Stand out His lips Firmly pressed together A man of pride through and through He's an officer of the law His spirit snarls at the government He's just a petty officer Razor Hanzo's anger explodes He is the Edo's watchdog THE CASTLE THE END
