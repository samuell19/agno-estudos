Mankind never realize their ability to change. They wait for the right moment. Even though the right moment is usually already in their hands. Check this out. Now it's dead. Stupid zebra. Hey, how's your car's air-conditioning? Is it okay now? It's okay now. I sent it for repair. But it happened again. Again? It's time for you to get a new car. Sir. - Driving license and identity card. - Yes, sir! Sir. Azman. I'm on my way to Muar. Wouldn't it be faster if you take the highway? Well, I wanted to save money. This way, I can avoid the toll. Does your company not allow claims? Open this up! Don't you understand Malay? Open the back. Hurry up. Open it! What's with the troop? Going to a wedding? A soccer match? Sir. I have a permit. Let me show you. Is this your first day at work? Here. This would be enough for the down payment of your dream car. Okay. For Siti. Azman. There are hundreds of zebras in Africa. Yet they are ruled by lions. Why is that? It's because the zebras' survival instinct is to save themselves. That's just pure stupidity. Imagine if they have brains. They can unite and stamp on the lion. None of them would die. Do you understand? I understand. Can you hurry up? Be patient. This requires delicate work. Hey. What do you think you're doing? Isn't it obvious? Hey! Are you uploading this on Facebook? Facebook? I dare you. - Go on and record us! - Where are you going? Are you running? Let's go, guys! Go on, record us. Keep going! Just go! She's pretty. Is that okay? What time will you arrive? Share all your flight details with me. Yes! Fizah, are you listening? I haven't bought the ticket yet. I'll share it once I've bought it, okay? Oh, God. You haven't bought it yet? Do you know what today's date is? Are you coming back or not? - Are you still angry at me? - No, I'm not. What then? Don't tell me that this is about your work visa. No. It's not. I'm late for work. Let me call you back later. Once you've bought the tickets, share with me all the details, okay? Yes. Okay, bye! Fizah? Did you hear about Anand's child? No. Why? What happened? It's the kind of work he does. Karma maybe. Oh, I almost forgot. Aryan! A loving person. Our baby's name, Aryan. Do you like it? King Lee just texted me. Our meeting is confirmed. King Lee? The big factory owner? Is it him? I know you don't like him. It doesn't matter. He gives us business. Just be careful. Rajinikanth! Is there a problem? No, it's nothing. Aryan? I like it. Malaysia's GE14 is coming. Many Malaysians working in Singapore are already making plans to return home to vote. Since it falls on a working day, many Singaporean employers are providing paid leaves to their employees and some bus companies are even providing free bus services to bring voters home... - Young lady. - One chicken rice, takeaway. Please wait for a while. Goodness. Here comes the lazy worker. You never bothered to serve the customers, but you still want to take leave to go home to vote. You only have one vote. It won't make a difference anyway. Stop dreaming. - Come! - One wanton noodles, please. One wanton noodles, right? Okay, just one. Sure, okay! Take a seat. Hey pretty girl, here's your wanton noodles. Are there no more pretty girls in Singapore? What an odd taste. That's enough! That's none of your business! - What's wrong with you? - Stop talking nonsense! What's up with you? - Do you want to get deported? - I'm not afraid of you! Stop fighting! - Stop fighting! - Calm down! Damn you! Go back to Malaysia! This is Singapore. Speak nicely. What did you do to him? - What happened? - He's just a busybody! - I'm not afraid of you! - Come here! Didn't your parents teach you to always knock before entering? What's the matter? Look at this! What happened here? Order from the Ministry. All funds are cut. So? No more funding? We just started school. Why is this happening? I don't understand. It's none of your business. Just follow the memo. Stop arguing. This is not about me. I need to explain this to my students. If they find out, they will be very disappointed. Ms. Shanthi! There are no more funds. I'll continue. Free of charge! Someone is here to see you. Take over for me. I'll be back shortly. I knew you were a teacher. But I didn't know that you teach Bharatham too. Are you Subramaniam? You can go ahead. It's fine, please go ahead. Well, to be honest, you look much prettier in person. I can't believe you're still single. Sorry, don't get me wrong. I just want to be frank. Since we're on this topic... I'm already in love with someone else. Don't get me wrong. I just want to be frank. Besides that, I'm not interested in an arranged marriage. Oh gosh. I'm running late! Can you give me a ride? Hello, Dad. Never mind, I'll inform Azman later. Dad, my battery is running out. Okay then. It drains out really fast. Hey! Don't touch it. This is mine. I was just borrowing it. - Dad. - Yes, dear. Dad, look. This is your essay, isn't it? Yes. Clever girl! Where did you get this? This? Sarah bought it for me. She went to Genting. Her whole family went to Genting. Isn't it cute? Dad, when can we go to Genting? We'll go someday, okay? - Really? - Yes. For my birthday? Adam, come here. Have you finished your homework? I'm still doing it. How are you still doing it? Adam. You must study hard. It'd be easy to get a good job when you grow up. When mine arrives, I'll let you know. What's wrong? You know that the ballot paper is still not here? There is not enough time to send it back now. It should've arrived much earlier. My sister asked me to go back. Oh yes. Your sister's getting married, right? So, when are you going back? Don't tell me you got into a fight again with your sister. She nags a lot. It's my prerogative to work here or not. Does she think it's easy to pass the interview? - They've replied? - Yes. And you got the offer? But what is wrong with going back for a while? So if I accept it, I have to apply for a work visa. So, if I go back, it's like I'm rejecting the offer. But your sister is getting married, you know. Fizah. If you do go back, can you deliver my vote for me? Only if I go back. I just have to wait for my ballot paper to arrive. The medical checkups are done. All healthy and fit. What about their hostel, King? Come on, Selva. They're only foreign workers. We don't have to treat them like emperors. I don't understand you. Why would you spend so much money on them? King. Raj called me just now. Is that so? You are close to him, right? What should I do? I've known him for a long time. He may look tough, but back then... He was once small too. But I've already helped him a lot. Same with me. You know why everyone calls me King, don't you? Okay then. No, boss. - Are you talking back? - No, boss. Sorry. It's my fault, boss. Just a routine disciplinary measure. Sometimes, we have to use force on these people. What's your name? Don't be afraid. You can tell me. Salam. Here. Uncle. It's okay. Continue with your drawing. Leong! What did you do this time? How many jobs have you ruined? When are you going to learn to control your temper? Other people don't even have chances to work in Singapore. Please appreciate it. Can you stop burdening your family? I didn't mean to scold you. You're my only brother. I want the best for you. Singapore is all about laws. So what? Sometimes, the law doesn't favor what's right. I cannot betray my own conscience. You're already in Singapore. Forget about your past and start a new life here. Apply for the PR status. Find a new girlfriend and get married. Follow my footsteps. This life is not suitable for me. Raj! Sorry, I didn't get to reply to your messages. It's okay, no problem. I know you're busy. Don't make me feel bad. Come, take a seat. So how can I help you, Raj? Just the usual. Go to this address for the pickup. The rest is as we discussed. But Raj... I thought everything is done. I already did the video for you. Of course, Selva. Our community really appreciates you. You did very well. That's why King gave you the job. I can't do it this time. My wife is expecting our baby soon. She needs me around. It's fine then. I'm sorry, Raj. I understand. Parenthood. I understand. All right, I'll make a move. Keep the address here. In case you change your mind. You never know. Okay. Thank you, sir. Hi, Ms. Shanthi. That's rude! Am I not handsome enough? Dad! What was that guy doing here? He was holding that envelope. The same one from your desk. What is going on here? I see. It's starting to make sense now. - You're using the school funding for... - Stop making false assumptions. This is not what you think. Stop accusing me. Who am I to question you? According to you, even bringing this up is wrong! You are trying to rock the boat. - That's why you're wrong. - What are you referring to? Listen! I tried to find you a groom, but you rejected him again! Not only that. No more PACA training again! MOM Hello, Mom? Leong, have you eaten? Did you eat out again? When you're back home, I'll make you old cucumber soup. I'm already full. You only know how to cook the old cucumber soup! What about you? Did you take the vitamins that I bought for you? Yes, lots of it! That's not how it works! Take only one a day! I know! I was just kidding! Your phone can't be used anymore, can it? It's still working. I just need to keep it plugged in. Without the charger, the battery would just drain out. I'll get you a new phone soon. No, you don't have to. Your car's air-conditioning is not working anymore. What did the mechanics say about it? Did Father call just now? Yes. What did he say? He said. Mom's leg needs surgery or amputation. Can't the hospital help us at all? When I get the money, we'll pay all the hospital bills. I think I want to sell nasi lemak, dear. Maybe that would help. Hold that thought, Siti. I'll think of other ways. Fizah! We appreciate it. JPR, PRIORITY What are you guys doing here? So we came to pass it to you. You are going back tomorrow, aren't you? Hold on. Fizah! What did you do? I... Fizah! Fizah! Fizah! Just give me a minute. I posted a video on Facebook saying that you'll be heading back to Malaysia with my vote. - You... - I know, I shouldn't have. But you have to see the video, okay? The response is absolutely crazy! I did not expect so many people to respond this way. What were you thinking? I only agreed to bring back your vote and now I have to bring back all these strangers' votes too? Fizah. All of them have placed their hopes on you. You don't have to know them. If you don't help them, their vote will never make it back. Yes, we are all far away from Malaysia but we want to make a difference. And you can help us. But you do know that I didn't even register, don't you? If you're not voting, at least help bring back our votes. What is going on? Who is in charge? Mr. Selva. We have a search warrant for your company. - Search warrant? - Yes. Your company is under investigation for bringing in foreign workers without permit. Without permit? Yes. Don't worry, Mr. Selva. This is all just protocol. Thank you. Wake up! - Come! - Wake up! - Sit quietly! - Wake up! Sit quietly! Move it! - Here! - Sit down! - Get up! - Move! Boss, should we call the lawyer? There's no need. Bring them out! Move it! Move! Mr. Selva, we're getting harassed here. Sir, what's happening? It's nothing. - What is this? - Get out, you're not allowed to enter. Get them out of here! Hey! That hurts! Leave! Please, leave. Just calm down. What are you doing here? On whose order? Hurry up! We still have a lot more places to go. Why would you take out the dark blue ones? Take the light blue ones. There! The light blue and red ones. You guys are hopeless. Replace it with this. What are you doing? - What's your problem? - You're breaking the law! - This is illegal! - Calm down, sir. Budin! I seek forgiveness in Allah. What are you doing? Mom, I'm working. You call this work? By damaging someone else's property? Do you want to be a gangster now? Ma'am, calm down. There is no problem here. This can be settled easily. Here, take it. I don't want it. What you're doing is wrong. Ma'am. - See? You want it. - Is this all? You want more? No problem. You guys want some too? It's just simple, isn't it? - You? - No, thank you. I know what this is. This is illegal money. Can you prove it? Don't accuse me without proof. That's not nice. - Do you want it, or not? - No. - Are you sure? - Of course. Azman! Stop! Look at these people. - Please do something about this. - Okay, wait. Now you're in trouble! What's all this? Officer Johan. This is what it's all about. Here it is. - But what you are doing is... - Azman. We can't possibly disobey this order. Everyone, clear out. Azman, but... Ma'am, sir. We're sorry. It's prayer time soon. Please go home, okay? Budin, get down from there! Go home! Come down and go home! - Go home! - Ma'am. What are you doing? He's my son! Hey! Azman! Are you just going to let him go? Let him go. He's only a kid. This is our responsibility, Johan! Look. I know you're not angry with that kid. All this is beyond our power. We're just like mosquitoes in comparison to that man's boss. Listen to me, just let it be. Think about your family. Let's keep in touch, okay? We can have drinks with Tan Sri. Remember this, Azman. We can't save the world, but we can save our loved ones. Guys, do you know what a true Malaysian looks like? You don't have to look far. Just look at my sister. Come home soon! Come on. Rest, dear. What happened, Selva? Is the baby okay? The baby is fine. You just rest now. How did I get here, Selva? What happened? You fainted in our garden while you were cleaning. Thank goodness, someone brought you here. I don't... remember any of this. Is our baby all right, Selva? Yes, everything is fine. Sir, I need to check her temperature. Don't worry. Nurse, who brought her here? I think he is waiting for you outside. How is she? She's fine. Thank God! Family is precious, Selva. I'm glad that nothing happened to Latha. You're very lucky. I've told you before. If we do what we're told, everyone will be safe. We can't be with them all the time, Selva. Do you know what I mean? Keep my family out of this. Out of what? Come on, Selva. You should be more grateful. We don't want bad things to happen to our loved ones, right? If you threaten me again, I swear... Your family is my family too. Think carefully. Don't make the wrong decision. I will see you again soon. Two teh tarik, less sugar. Thank you. Right? Two teh tarik. Peace be upon you, Father. How is Mother doing? It's... It's been amputated? Oh my God! Father? Father. Don't be like this, Father. Father, listen to me. Father, listen to me. Father, listen... Father, please don't cry. Father. Father. Father, listen to what I have to say. Listen, Father. I will do whatever I can to help. I will get the money for her surgery. Please wait. Okay, Father? Father... Father, just wait. Yes. Peace be upon you. Uncle. Why are they so gung ho to send it from so far away? Your brother is outside, speak to him before you leave. Leong. Give this to Mom. And this. Here's some money. Pass it to Mom and keep some for yourself. Use it wisely. Tell Mom, I'll go back when I'm free. Call me if you need my help. I know your dad is still angry at Leong. Tell him I said sorry, okay? My dad is old-fashioned. He won't forget easily. I know what Leong did was wrong. He shouldn't have hit your dad. Shanthi. Have you forgiven Leong? If someone spoke badly about my family, maybe I would've done the same. Do you know that our country is going through another critical general election? Here's a fun fact. An online campaign called #UndiRabu has successfully raised more than RM65,000 yesterday with the target of helping voters... Have you been following the Malaysian Amazing Race? I heard they're bringing the overseas ballot papers back. Amazing, isn't it? I have been following that. How can it not be amazing? The Balik Undi Campaign is awesome. Free bus tickets and air tickets are also discounted. My boss is so nice. He gave us time to go back to vote and allowance too. Let me know if you need any help. Okay, thank you! Mom. Leong, you're back! You're finally back. This is great! You look so thin. Have you been eating? Your brother didn't cook for you? Mom, he couldn't come home. His American boss called for a meeting at the last minute. He asked me to pass this to you. And this. No need to cover for him, I know he won't come back. Are you hungry? Let's order some food. Sir! One fried kuey teow. All right. Take a seat. Ma'am, sir. Hello, everyone! I'm giving a speech tonight. Vote for me. Remember PNM. Thank you. It's that PNM candidate again! How are you doing? Sorry, I'm busy now. Never mind. Please continue! Hello, everyone! Don't forget to come to my talk tonight at 8:00 p.m. Remember to vote for PNM. - Sir. - My hand is dirty. Better not dirty yours. Never mind. Please continue! Hello, everyone! - Don't forget to come to my speech... - You can't vote for these people. Remember to vote for PNM. - Is this enough for you? - No. Not enough? You want more? - Eat this first. Ask for more later. - Dear, give Adam just a bit. Please put it here. You can have the soup now, Aisha. Adam, do you want a lot or a little rice? Just a bit, dear. It is not always that we get to eat a meal like this. Let's enjoy it. Do you want some soup, Adam? Ask your dad to get it for you. Thank God! So, when can Mother be discharged from the hospital? All right. The important thing is that she's stable now. Don't mention it, Father. There is no need to thank me. It's my responsibility to take care of her. Peace be upon you too! It's not even the end of the year yet, but you've gotten your bonus already? Yes. Now, you can call your mom without being connected to the charger. - Dear. - Yes? At the market earlier, there was an accident. Poor Usop, the fishmonger. He was hit. Oh, God. Is he okay? He is fine. It's just that the traffic lights at the junction was not working. It was chaotic. Luckily, Ibrahim was there to help solve the matter. If I'd been there, I would've helped with the traffic. What is it? Don't you believe me? You've always helped others. I believe that you'll continue to do so. Mr. Selva. Boss, thank you for helping me at the factory that day. Yes! - How have you been doing? - I'm fine, boss. - Did they beat you up again? - No, boss. Don't lie to me, Salam. I'm not lying, Boss. It's not easy for me to come and work in this country. I earn enough to feed my wife and kids. As long as they are happy, I'm happy, boss. Salam. It's a tough world we live in. It is unfair. But if someone bullies you, you must stand up for yourself, okay? - Take this. - No, boss. No money. You treat me with kindness and I want to repay your kindness. I'll make a move first, boss. Once you've arrived, just look for the volunteers, okay? They will then sort out everything, won't they? Yes. Don't worry. Sorry. I can only send you up to this point. Sasha! Hi! Luckily, we got here in time. Okay, hurry up! Any more? No? Have a safe flight. SISTER: LET ME KNOW ONCE YOU'VE ARRIVED. I MIGHT BE LATE. IT'S OKAY, I CAN GO HOME BY MYSELF. THE PLANE'S TAKING OFF. SEE YOU SOON! Going home to vote? Yes. What about you? Voting is my excuse to go back to my hometown. I've been living in London for a long time. I've never missed an election. Why is that? Because as Malaysians, we have a responsibility. It doesn't matter where we live. Malaysia is where we were born. See you back home. And education prospect will be extended overseas for everyone. More importantly, more people will have access to low-cost housing. More entrepreneurs will be born... And the average household income will see a positive increment. Skills and technical training will be available to school leavers. - These reporters have come from far away. - These are not empty promises. - This is the voice of our people? - But. - What is this? - A responsibility. - Where are our people? - That will definitely be fulfilled, so you can afford to own a low-cost housing. - Hey! What are you doing? - More entrepreneurs. - Are you looking for trouble? - Will be born and opportunities for skills training. - Are you looking for trouble? - Or technical training will be given to school leavers. These are not empty promises. I am calling on all citizens who love this country, to go out tomorrow and vote for Pakatan Harapan to save Malaysia. Our people are willing to defend our sovereignty and the independence of our nation. Letting down their insistence. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the last time that I'm able to contribute to this beloved country. Praise and gratitude be to God. His gifts know no limits. Peace and prosperity. My Malaysia is happy and well. With the determination to succeed. To serve our land and people. We hold high our noble ambitions. Unity throughout the nation. United in our words, hearts, and souls. To face any challenge. We are ready and faithful. To sacrifice for our country. Our beloved, shining Malaysia. Raise the flag proudly. We will protect the name. Peace and prosperity. For Malaysia. Dear. I'll make a move now, Siti. May God ease all your affairs. Dear. Yes, Siti? Our children still have a long way to go. What we feed Aisha and Adam today will shape what they will become someday. Azman. Do you remember that I once told you the difference between humans and animals? Quite a few times. Muar? Check it first. Melaka. - Melaka. - Okay, thanks. What? You are here? Yes, I've arrived. Kedah, who is the runner for this? - Ipoh. - Let me check. - Double check. Okay. - I want to pass you these ballots. - Johor. - Johor Bahru? - Johor, right? - Yes. Please double check it. Kuantan. - Kuantan? - Sir, these are for Ayer Hitam. For Ayer Hitam? Taiping. Ayer Hitam. - Taiping. - Ayer Hitam. Where is the runner for Ayer Hitam? There's a lot here. I think the runner isn't here. What happens if there is no runner? There are a lot of ballots here. If there is no runner, it will all go to waste. Yes, we are all far away from Malaysia, And you can help us. Fizah! I miss you so much! Why are you here? I told you I can go home on my own. It's okay. It doesn't take me long anyway. Let's go. Let's go. What's wrong? I'm sorry. I need to settle this first. I'll go home on my own. You just go back first. It's okay. Don't worry! I'll call you if anything is up, okay? Okay? I want to volunteer for Ayer Hitam. Sir? - Ayer Hitam? - Yes. But I have no transport. Ayer Hitam, right? You can come with me. Let's hurry. Let's hurry. 23, JALAN JAMAL, TAMAN SRI TANJUNG, 84000, MUAR, JOHOR Selva? Are you Musang? You've come a long way to Muar. Here. Put this on. JPR, 14TH GENERAL ELECTION, VOLUNTEER Hey, go and get the other bag. That's a lot of votes, Musang. You're just the same. For our country. Country? Nonsense! Go ahead. Anantha A/L Saminathan. Identification card number, 791101105877. Correct. Okay, Sir. You may proceed. I will need your left finger. Index finger. Your left index finger. Left hand. Your left index finger. The left hand. Objection! I would like to request this voter's IC to be checked. Okay, I've checked. He may proceed. Can you please verify his identity card again? Nothing's wrong. What's your name? Please state your IC number and full address. Do you understand Malay? - What... Don't look at your card. - Sir. - State your name and address... - Please put away your phone. Show me your identity card. - Do you understand Malay? - That's a Bangladeshi. What is your name? - Where do you come from? - Yes, sir? Don't look at your card. - Miss. - What is your name? I'm sorry, miss. Please leave. This is our responsibility, understand? Please leave the hall, miss. Please do not make a scene here. Miss. Please understand, sir. - Something is not right here. - Please leave the hall, miss. This is not right. Shanthi. Making a big scene there will not solve anything. Do you realize what you are doing? Don't you have a conscience? What are you afraid of? Listen. There's a system above us. Obeying the system is our duty. I'm not afraid. I'm being civilized. Turning a blind eye in the face of injustice is called uncivilized. You must understand that there are two types of people. One that works within the system. And another working outside the system. I belong to the first. Follow the rules and you will lead a good life. I'd rather lead a hard life and fight against a system that I know is wrong. If you want to walk down this losing path, I can't help you. That's your choice. Dad. Your words will come back to haunt you. Remember that. Correct. Correct. Correct. Let's find out which queue it is. VOTERS' REGISTRATION CONFIRMATION, JPR Sir. It's okay. Wait for me here, Mom. Leong. Please be quiet. I'm sorry. Leong. Shanthi. Shanthi. Shanthi. Oh my! Traffic jam! I will bring your luggage there later, okay? Thank you, ma'am. Hurry up. Azman. Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Please wait, sir. I brought ballots from London. - Please let me in. - I'm sorry, miss. - It's too late. - It'll only take a minute. Please help me, sir. Please let her in to hand over the ballots. I can't let her in, ma'am. This is the rule. You're late. You have to deal with it. This is not right. Please open the gate, sir. - Please help her. - Please open the gate, sir. - Please help her. - Please open the gate, sir. - Please open the gate, sir. - That's right. - Please open the gate, sir. - Please help her. Please open the gate, sir. Let her in! Please open the gate now, sir! I'm sorry, miss. It's not that I don't want to open it. But this... Please help me, sir. Please, sir! Please, sir! Leong! Ballot boxes! - Help! - Ballot boxes! Ballot boxes! No! That's enough, Johan! Enough! If zebras unite... That's enough! That's enough! That's enough! Stay calm. That's enough. Stay calm. Stay calm, everyone. Stay calm. - Everyone, please calm down! - Stay calm! Okay. The car is reversing. Stay calm! Please give way. - Go! - Hurry! Go! Please give way! Please give way! - Long live the people! - Long live the people! Dad. Fizah. I'm getting married. Don't be sad. You've tried your best. Please, smile. I feel responsible for everything that has happened. If only your mom is still alive, I wouldn't be in this mess. Chia Tak Leong! You still have that temper, don't you? May God bless you. May God bless you. May God bless Aisha. Leong. Does she have fingers? "I, Mahathir bin Mohamad," have been elected to serve as the Prime Minister. With sincerity, I swear that I will honestly fulfill the responsibilities of this position with all my ability. I will give my true loyalty and faithfulness to Malaysia. And I will maintain, protect, "and defend the constitution." Have you finished packing? Yes, but I'm not going back. Really? I want to stay here. Great! "I, Mahathir bin Mohamad," - solemnly swear - What happens after this? That I will never mention - or reveal to anyone, - I don't know. Directly or indirectly, any matters that will be brought up for my consideration. We have to try. That will come to my knowledge. - We will work it out. - As a Prime Minister, except for when it is required for me to fulfill my responsibilities accordingly as hereby, or as allowed by special assignment "by the Yang DiPertuan Agong." Let's hug! Mankind just need to believe in the goodness of himself, the sincerity of their hearts and the magic of the beginning of a new dawn.
