One of those holy boys acting as a marshal for the company. (coughing) Somebody get this piece of infected bio-garbage away from me! Stage a little welcome for our keeper. Make it look like a mugging. Get some low-life dome punk to set it up. Go! (foreboding music) (coughing) - Okay. Okay, I'll make a deal with you. 50 now, 50 later. Come on, you know I'm good for it, Roxanne. Hey, what do you say? Half off for Boney, here. Oh, well, forget it. She's got Dome Plague. Get out of here. - Greenberg, got a job! - Hold on, okay?

(groaning) (yelling) (whooshing) (yelling) Hm? (thudding) You just saved my life. That was close. - I.D. - What're you talking about? Oh, do you mean this? Is this your? My god, it is. You know, I was gonna give that back. You know, being the noble citizen that I am, I was gonna turn that into the proper authorities, such as yourself. So where's my reward? - Who were those punks? - I don't know what you're talking about, man. Look, they just gave me a couple of credits for a little bump and run, that's all. Look, I didn't know they was gonna ambush you. I didn't, honest injun. (somber music) - [Computer] Deceased. - [Nurse] Erase file. - [Computer] File erased. - I'm looking for a patient, Ino Templar. - I'm busy, come back later!

Processing. - Cryo-support, section six. (somber music) (coughing) - [Announcer] Entering section six. - I got something for you, old friend. Not yet, nose boy. Info first. Who is he? - Company muscle. Came looking for his brother. Some cop that came in D.O.A. two days ago. - [Greenberg] So the beau was looking for his bro? - [Nose Boy] Had a card said he was some kind of Keeper. - There must be something monumental afoot around here. - All I know is that he got smoked good. Execution style. - Any booty involved? - Word is it was a who satchel of something serious. - Satchel full of what? Credits? Z-bite? - I wish. - You know, them Order boys are real bad. - Order boys? Order boys are raised on kung fu ninjaese, okie dokie. - What you're saying is, we got the Keeper coming to give his last rites to his bro. We got a dirty cop with a bag full of goodies. Oh, I smell a deal here somewhere. (ominous music) - [Announcer] Stay away from the glass partition. Patients are in quarantine. No physical contact with plague victims is allowed.

Just turn around real slow and go back the way you came. - This man is my brother. - You got any ID, brother? I'd offer my condolences, but you Order boys get paid to die, don't you? - We solve Company problems. - When you solve these problems my work goes into double overtime. - What happened to him? - Multiple laser punctures, bone fractures, subcutaneous traumas. Coup de gr√¢ce was a blaster wound. It's a mob signature. Usually destroys the memory. - Did it? - Don't know. I won't know until tomorrow morning because that's how long it's gonna take to download him. - You don't care much for the law, do you? - I don't mind the law. It's the Order I'm not a big fan of. Especially the way you people see it. - I will be back. - One way or another. (moaning) - Faster, Z-bitch! You know you love it! (moaning) - More! Give me more! Come on, I need it! (groaning) - Z-bite fix coming up. (moaning) - Come on! (groaning) (thudding) (moaning) - Get lost! Get out, Z-head! Oh, Roko. Looks like that Keeper messed you up. That Keeper just too fast for you? (thudding) Huh? Keepers are fast like that. You know, this kind of thing really pisses me off and I'm in a very good mood. So just a little punishment will do. (groaning) You're fired. (chuckling) - Hey, bub! I'll carry your bag for you. - [Caution] Get lost. - Oh, don't shut me out. Come on, Mr. Keeper, man. I'm a good man to know. I can help you with any problem. Ask me anything. Everybody knows I know everybody. Everybody knows, Buckskin knows everybody. Let me make a deal with you. - A moment of your time. Find a sandbox, kid. - Catch you later, bub. - When I was a Keeper, we signed into company headquarters before we started a sweep. - Just got off the shuttle. - Name's Bascom. Chief of security, IP Mining. Let's talk. Why would the company send you here? Or is there something I don't know about? The company only sends a Keeper out when things get out of hand. - One of out men flatlined down here two days ago. - I know. Ino Templar. So what's the connection? - My name's Caution Templar. He was my brother. - Oh. My condolences. I shoulda realized. You know, I knew your father. I served under him 30 years ago when he was Order Commander. Didn't know he had two sons. The way it looks right now, Ino coulda been mixing with bad company. - What are you saying? - I'm saying that witnesses saw him running away with a satchel. Coulda been something valuable. Anyway, there's someone important who wants to meet you. Come on. (somber beat music) Mr. Clement? Caution Templar. - Philip Clement, VP operations, here, in Alpha City. Always a pleasure to host one of our associates from the Order. After all, we like to think of our employees as one big family. We should help each other whenever there's a problem. Although, I think you'll find the criminal element in Alpha City is negligible. Of course, the mining operation's running smoothly along. And that's what we're about. Silex, once refined, is the most efficient natural fuel found anywhere in the system. Please, sit, gentlemen. Tell me, Caution, why were you sent down here? - I'm here to investigate a murder. - Templar's brother, Ino, was on assignment here, sir. Somebody killed him two days ago. - I'm so sorry. I didn't know your brother well but well enough to know that he was a good man. And I don't, for a minute, believe those rumors. If there's anything we can do, I mean anything at all, you just tell me. - Your brother had a room at the Nostromo Inn. I suppose you'll wanna start you investigation there. We can arrange to have you stay there while you're in town. - Of course. And the door to my office is always open. (electron video game music) - [Announcer] Welcome to the Nostromo Inn. Serving satisfied customers since the Great Silex Rush. - I think you got a customer. - I can see you, Keeper. - Ino Templar's old room. I have company clearance. - Sure. Here it is. Keeper room seven. (laughing) Come here, honey. Come here. Hey, want some poochie? Very young poochie. Retro-virgin. (laughing) - I'm not interested. Give me the key. - Not interested? (ominous music) (knife slicing) - You don't wanna do this. - Oh, I think we do. (knife swishing) (thudding) (groaning) (yelling) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) (yelling) (glass shattering) - What do you know about a cop getting blasted two days ago? Huh? - I don't know a thing. I aint heard no word on that, man. - Everybody heard about it. Who did it? - Coulda been anybody. You got your Z-heads, and your smugglers. Your pimps. Nobody likes the law around here, man. Nobody! (foreboding music) The boss promised me a bonus if you're dead before sundown. (groaning) - Who's your boss? - I can't tell you, man. He'll kill me. (yelling) All right, all right. Ike Ringo. - Where do I find him? Where? (bones cracking) - The Silex Nugget down the strip. - Nice to meet you. Happy holidays! Hey, babe, listen. The Buckskin's gonna be rolling in the credits now. See, I hooked up with this Keeper and word has it there's a satchel full of Z-bite to be had. You like that, don't you? See, if you stick with me, I'll get you off this disease-ridden planet. Hey, beau! I'll catch you later, babe. Gotta go! Hey, beau, Buckskin Greenberg at your service. I'm telling you, beau, nobody, nobody knows this dome like me. Of course, any good Alphin, such as myself, they don't just pop out of an incutube, they need to be nurtured, incentified. A place like this could be a regular credit line. You and me hook up, we could run it right. Oh, beau, you gotta love modern technology. Look at this. This is a Jenny Max Joy. Hey, baby. Hey, beau, I checked her out personally. Hey, there's not one original part left on that pleasure pinata. Beau, is it true that Keepers never bump uglies? You know, do the nasty? Horizontal mambo? - Wait! Wait! - Oh, the Silex Nugget. (beat music) (club commotion) - Hey, miners only! Dome rat. - Hey, cool your boosters, King Kong. I'm with the Keeper. Keep your grimy paws off. (beat music) (men laughing) Beau! - [Caution] Is that him? - The bald guy? No, that aint Ringo. That's Fargo. No. You don't wanna rattle their cage. - All right, man, you play the hand, you're stupid after all. (laughing) (ominous music) What do you want, Keeper creep? Lap dance is over there. Bet you Keepers don't even like girls. - Where's Ike Ringo? - Ike, who? Never heard of him. (ominous music) What're you gonna do? Arrest me? (laughing) (glass shattering) - Greasy bastard! Like I said, Ike Ringo! - I don't know. What do you think, he hangs out with you cops? - Find out and tell him I want him. You got that? - Yeah. - Huh? - Yeah! (swishing) (groaning) (thudding) (yelling) - [Buckskin] Look out! (thudding) (glass shattering) - Come on, bastard! (thudding) (glass shattering) - Way to go! Let's go! Let's go! Come on! Way to kick some butt! - This Keeper's starting to stick in my craw! He digs any deeper, he might discover our dirty little secret. Get our best guys together. I want that brother's memory chip! I'm going with you. If you screw this up, just throw yourself off the skywalk, save me the trouble. - [Announcer] Here at Nostromo Inn, you pleasure is our highest priority. Indulge yourselves with our selection of our Jenny-Max enhanced playmates. - [Computer] Access granted. Enter. - Lights. Closet. (beeping) (electronic buzzing) (ominous music) Z-bite. (dramatic music) (knocking) - Beau, it's me, it's Buckskin! Come on, you told me to meet you here in a half hour. I am really being serious. I wanna be a Keeper. I really wanna be a Keeper. You gotta hook me up. You guys got the slickest scam going in town. I mean, you're going, you do a little bruising, and then you get whatever you want. Look, you've really gained my respect. I like it. I mean, I really, really like it. - It's not what you think! - Beau! Beau, come on! - [Computer] Mineral analysis complete. Comparison with damaged human DNA complete. Results negative. Negative. Negative. - Give me a cross molecular comparative analysis wit all local geology on record versus tissue samples A-23... Through T-630. (beeping) (ominous music) - [Computer] Processing. (gasping) (sighing) - Man, you've gotta make a noise when you walk in a room, or something. - What's the status with Ino? - He's still dead. Sorry. Just me and the boys. Conversations are few and far between. Ino's memory download should take another minute or so. - [Computer] Analysis initiated. - What's all this? - It's research. I've been trying to figure out what's making everybody on this planet so sick. The company says that it's airborne. That the re-breather's help. I don't buy it. - [Computer] Negative. - I've got a holoframe here. Do you have an IEM? - Image Enhancement Module? Yeah, it's old and outdated like everything else around here but it works. Why? What're you gonna do? - The picture file that was in this holoframe has been deleted. But the image burns into the surface of the glass over time. The IM will make it visible to the eye. - I thought all you keepers did was break bones, bust up people. You know, loyal to the company. The company is God. Order is your family. Not very impressed by any of it. - If that's true, then why are you here, doc? - Why is anybody here? Bad luck. Bad timing. Nobody comes to Mars for a tan. Everybody's running away from something. - [Computer] Stay away from the glass partition. - Let's go, guys! Get the disk! (ominous music) - [Doc] Wow! That's impressive. - Print. - [Computer] Printing. (ominous music) - Very impressive. (foreboding music) (whooshing) (thudding) Ino's memory disk. (fighting commotion) (glass shattering) - [Radio Dispatcher] Security. Disturbance at the hospital, section six, Cryo Support. (ominous music) - Come on! Come on! (alarm beeping) - [Computer] Memory disc ejected. - The disc! (thudding) (suspenseful music) (groaning) - [Ringo] Fuck the disc! Let's get out of here! (yelling) (electrical fizzling) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) - Hey! Templar! Caution Templar! You don't think we got enough casualties around here, son? You listen to me, Caution. I may not be on the roles anymore, but you aint dealing with an old fool. We both work for the company first, last and forever. I'm the shepherd of this dome and you're a company attack dog. When the Company tells you to sit, you sit. When the Company tells you to heel, you heel. Right now we don't need your teeth. - My brother's dead. Someone's gotta pay the bill. - You're gonna pay for it if you don't leave Alpha City. I strongly suggest you get on the first shuttle out of here. - [Computer] Access granted. - Security close. (dramatic music) Playback. - [Child] Mommy, where are you? Mommy, I see you. I see you. (people cheering) - Your turn, Ino. (ominous music) Keep your balance! Be more like your brother! - Fast forward. (suspenseful music) - Oh, Ino. - [Ino] I did wrong. I broke the code. But I won't, I won't let you kill her! - [Computer] File corrupted. Remainder deleted. (ominous music) (beeping) - Security open. - [Computer] Voice pattern confirmed. - Lights. Computer. (beeping) Messages. - [Computer] No messages. (menacing music) Sani-spray ready. Water temperature 78 degrees. - [Doc's Voice Recording] Security Open. - [Computer] Voice pattern confirmed. - Go, go, go, go. (suspenseful music) - Shit! Oh no! (buzzing) - Come here, baby! (whimpering) (electrical fizzling) - You know, a smart med-co like you oughta know enough to keep her nose out of politics. You oughta stick with cryo-support. Keep the bodies breathing. Keep her own body breathing. (electrical fizzling) - Here you go. - Nice body. (whimpering) - Look, I do stick to cryo. I'm not into politics. If this is about that cop's memory, check with the company. It's their regulations, not mine. - It's too bright in here. I need some atmosphere, I need some quiet. I need nap time. (buzzing) Say it! - Fuck you, asshole! (buzzing) - Say it! - Nap. No! - Oh, yeah. Better. Better. Oh, that's so much better. - I'm warning you, I'm protected. - Oh yeah, that's good. We are all into sani-sex - Fire! (whooshing) (yelling) (glass shattering) (alarm beeping) (dramatic music) (knocking) - [Caution] Open. - Please, just put that thing down. Look, the only reason I'm here is because you got me into this mess in the first place. - What mess? - Ike Ringo and a couple of his yo-yos were just at my apartment. They scared the shit out of me, but all I have to do is get back to the hospital and finish a job that I have to do. What? This is my bag. - Ino had a bag like this. - You know, Caution, I am no skull squeezer, but you are suffering from some serious obsessive behavior. - Why are you here? I thought you hated keepers. - Ike Ringo came after me because I downloaded Ino's memory and gave it to you. Now I am not a big fan of yours but you owe me! Caution, I am really sorry that your brother got killed. It had nothing to do with me. All I need to do is get to the hospital and I need your help. - Oh, you gotta be kidding me. Oh, look at you, beau. - Don't you ever knock, Greenberg? - Hey, lady, I saw him first. Look, I got business. Him and me. Business together. I'm his right hand man. Ham and mayo. Hornet and Kato. - You are dome scum, Greenberg. Friend to the highest bidder. - [Buckskin] Yeah? - [Doc] Yeah! - Stop it! - Oh, beau. - [Caution] Who is she? - Oh, she's a dancer. Girls at Strip Mine. You can tell. She got that collar, all the girls wear those. - Explain. - See, they all got these auto Z-bite collars and management, they zap a signal that sends them flying into orbit. Some of the things they do, beau, some of the things they do, you gotta see. I mean, it is incredible stuff. They are so sexy. - Let's go. - Okay, let's go. (exciting beat music) - Have you seen this girl? - She's on stage now. 50 credits at the door. (exciting beat music) - [Announcer] Get a firm grip on your Z-bite triggers, man. These girls love Z-bite! They'll love you for giving it to them. (women moaning) - I'd love to snap that Z-head. (laughing) - So tasty, baby! (exciting music) (woman moaning) (remotes beeping) (woman sexually moaning) (applauding) - [Announcer] Give it up for Shella! The hottest Z-head on Mars! (crowd applauding) Next up, Tamera and her twin satellites of love! (exciting beat music) (gasping) - What happened to Ino? - Ino who? - Ino Templar, my brother. - I know who you are. You came all the way out here because your brother finally got what he was begging for. Where the hell were you, huh? What do you want from me? - I want answers! - You don't want the truth because the truth was your brother was dirty! Oh yeah, he liked it all! Oh yeah, he was the dirtiest keeper in the planet. - That's not true! (glass shattering) (ominous music) - Oh, just like your brother. He liked that too. - Why would he ever love somebody like you, huh? - Your brother pissed on that Order badge. He was into the Z-bite run, taking a kick. Jesus, you didn't even know him. - What was in that bag? - That kid didn't mean nothing to me. He should've known that. He was crazy to even try it. - What kid? - [Guard] Hey! (groaning) (suspenseful music) - Get out of my way! (crowd commotion) (thudding) (groaning) (yelling) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) (whimpering) - Shella? Come on, Shella! You won't be blabbing to anybody again. - Uh oh. Oh, beau. This doesn't look good. (thugs laughing) - [Buckskin] I've got your back, beau. - Party time. - Oh, beau, this doesn't look like a very friendly party. (ominous music) (yelling) (fighting commotion) (banging) Take that! (thudding) Good shot, beau! (yelling) Get him, beau! You okay? (ominous music) You okay, beau? He'll kick your ass, Fargo. (groaning) Way to go! (screaming) (suspenseful music) (screaming) (screaming) (Shella gagging) (screaming) You hear that? Move! Move! Get out of the way! Oh no! (suspenseful music) (gagging) (laughing) - Oh my god. Doesn't look like it's gonna have a good ending, beau. I've never seen nothing like this before. Bring her down. Bring her down easy. Come on, make some room now! Back off! (ominous music) Get this thing off of you. Beau, she aint breathing. Come on, talk to me. Someone! Someone call a doctor! (foreboding music) (door opening) - My word, Keeper. Look at you. You look like you were hit by the hover bus. Bet you could use a drink. I've got a fine Apollo. 26, I think. - Sir, my brother's dead and his girlfriend's just been murdered. - Oh my god. - It was Ike Ringo. - I've talked to Bascom about these people until I'm purple! They're nothing but hoodlums. He always throws the union in my face as if... Sometimes I wonder who's running this dome. The Company or the miners. Tell me, what about the girl? Did she say anything before? Was she at all helpful? - She said something about a kid. - A kid as in child? No, no, no, Keeper, you must've misheard her. I mean, as you're aware, we have very strict regulations here on Alpha regarding family structure, don't get me wrong. I love kids. I have three little ones at home. I miss them terribly. I assure you, off the record, if they could be here they would be but the company rules are very clear on this issue. At any rate, I'm sure you realize by now, that there's probably little meaning at all behind your brother's death. I wish it were otherwise. But you and I will not be broken. We shall prevail. I want you to punch out a full report on this and we can work on it together. - Thank you, sir. - But I do assure you, there are no children on Mars. - [Computer] Analysis of Silex Chemical composition in selected damaged human DNA nearing completion. First new plague series, match. Second new plague series, match. (chiming) Third new plague series, match. Overall analysis concludes, match. (ominous music) - [Clement] Ringo! - Yes, sir? - [Clement] We need to talk. - Yes, sir, I'll be right there. - Caution! Jesus, what happened to you? - I'm fine. - Let me disinfect it. - [Buckskin] Fargo pulverized him with mining mace. (wincing) - What do you know about kids on Mars? (spraying) (groaning) - There are no kids on Mars. It's another company policy. - See, beau, I told you. No elves on Alpha. - What are you doing with the re-breathers? - We're going outside the dome to look for evidence. - I'd like to get out there soon before the storms act up and we can't find a way back. - Yeah, well you're wasting your time with those filters. I found it. - You found what? - For months I've been running tests to find out what's making everyone so sick and today I got the results. - What're you talking about, doc? - And it's not the air. It's not Z-bite, it's not anything that the company wants you to know about. - What is it? - Welcome to the gold rush, boys. Only this time, the gold is poison. It's the Silex. (foreboding music) - Let's go. - I'm right behind you, beau. - Wait a second. - Hey, what's next, beau? - Outside to where my brother was killed. - There's this old freak out there named Pete the Hermit. I bet he knows something about that satchel. - We'll find out. - Okay! - Damn it, Caution! Look, you don't get it. We've gotta warn people. We've gotta evacuate this planet now. - Not until I know who killed my brother and why. - See, it's about his bro, sis, and you wouldn't understand. - No, you don't understand. There's a lot more important things than your dead brother. - You do whatever you have to. - [Buckskin] Yeah, we're gonna go see Pete the Hermit. (dramatic music) - Of course the essence of productivity is a dedication to commitment to a healthy bottom line. That is what put Interplanetary on top and that is what will keep us here. Now, let us come to the issue of risk versus reward. Calculated risk. So what the hell are these two troublemakers doing?! I want answers, gentlemen. I need solutions. Otherwise, this whole operation will be jeopardized. - Yes, sir. - And your bonuses, forget it. The Company raises these Keepers from the time they're children, correct? We train them, we indoctrinate them. - They bleed like the rest of us, sir. (laughing) - Yes. That's it, Mr. Ringo. Up until now, you have had every Keeper who swans in here thinking he's saving the planet from Z-bite or whatever else, but now we have a zellet out there with a mission. Do you have any idea, Mr. Ringo, the danger posed by a pissed off Keeper?! - I'll get my people right on it, Mr. Clement. (foreboding music) - Whatever you did to the brother, do it again. Kill him. Am I clear? - Yes, sir. (ominous music) - What do you think was in that satchel? Z-bite? Credits? You think Pete the Hermit's got it? What are we gonna get? Tell me! - Answers. (beeping) - [Radio Guard] Sir, Dr. Halliday is here to see you. Should I send her in? (ominous beat music) Sir, she's coming up. Should I call security? - No, send her in. I'm expecting her. (foreboding music) - Clement, we have got to talk right now. - Sure, doctor, of course. It's rather good timing. Here, join me for a drink. - I've just sent a communicate to Entermed that's gonna cause the evacuation of this entire planet. They're gonna be here in less than 12 hours to investigate. In the meantime, you are the only person with the authority to get these workers to safety. - Okay. - Okay? - Sure. Please, drink up. You're obviously a little stressed. Lights, dim to tranquil. - Look, thank you very much but I don't drink. - Please, sit. Drink up and we'll talk. This is just a martian version of a fruit juice cocktail. - Fruit juice, huh? - Now, tell me everything. - The Silex, Mr. Clement, is what's causing the fatalities among the employees here. - I can't even guess as to the motivation behind that statement. It's such a radical leap of logic. - Yeah, well, it is the Silex. Look, I've proven it. Even got evidence. - Doctor, think about it. The fossil fuel that we discovered back in 1996 has passed every possible test ever devised on Earth and here you are claiming that you, alone, have discovered something that's withstood 60 years of expert scrutiny. No. (chuckling) (sighing) Are you all right, my dear? - Look, this whole operation on Mars, it's a big mistake. - Oh, no, no, no, doctor. The mistake is yours, I'm afraid. You see, the mission of this corporation can in no way be detoured by your lovely, yes, but sick, misguided idea. - What was in that drink? Bastard. (whimpering) (suspenseful music) - Service access. This is it. (foreboding music) - Let's do it. (somber beat music) Ike Ringo, voice ID. Security open. - Goddamn, got the worst re-breather. Thing's ancient. (foreboding music) - Hey, man, that's a particle beam. You can't use that in the Dome. - Hey, don't panic, it's a torch. It's no good outside a hundred yards but within that, everything's toast. (vacuum seal hissing) (wind howling) (alarm beeping) Hey, take your guys, go out the back. We're gonna beat the hermits. I'm gonna cover the dome. Finders, keepers. (wind howling) (coughing) - [Man] They've got a gun! Bastards! Hey, where'd they get those? (wind howling) (water sloshing) - There's something on the air. I can't make it out. - [Caution] Just follow me. Come on. (ominous music) (water sloshing) - Move it! Come on, faster! This way! Let's go! - [Caution] There it is. (ominous music) (metal squeaking) Come on. - [Computer] Access granted. Please initiate filtering process. (thudding) - [Caution] Where's the switch? (ominous music) (electrical fizzling) - [Computer] Please wait for oxygenation process to complete. Five, four, three, two, one. Oxygenation complete. You make exit airlock. (gun clicking) (door creaking) (coughing) (wind howling) - Hey, beau, look at all this stuff. - Hey! Shut the damn door! The filthy filters is already as unholy as the dark side of a lunar. Shut it! - Okay. Just take it easy, old man. (door thudding) - What's the law want with me? - Relax, old man! We're not here on Company business, okay? - Is that so? - Old timer, this is Caution Templar and they call me Buckskin Greenberg. Hey, take it easy! - Yeah, well they call me a crazy old fool. Maybe that's why they aint killed me yet. You're not here to check me registration papers, Keeper? - It's about my brother. - Yeah. Caution's bro was the dude that got blasted out here a few days ago. - Aye, bless his soul. I saw it all. Ike Ringo and company. They finished him. I took a satchel off of him. - A satchel? Keeper, eureka! Well cut to the chase, old man! What was in the satchel? - Shut up. - Come on, tell us! - Shut up! - What was in the satchel? - Shut up! - Yes, sir. - Shut up! - Okay, sir. - Shut up! - Just take it easy. - Doesn't he ever shut up? Yo, Greenberg. - Huh? - You move around too much and you run your mouth way too much. Sit your ass down. Sit your ass down! - Just take it easy. - Go on, sit your ass down on the table. Get over there. - Okay. Just don't point that thing at me, okay? Put it down. - [Fargo] Move! Let's finish this keeper! (wind howling) - You strong of heart, Keeper? I said, are you strong of heart, Keeper? (dramatic music) (wind howling) There's a wind storm, just like tonight. We always get them this time of year. (gunshots popping) I heard shots. I saw a man running. Didn't know who. (gunshots popping) But he must've known about me. He knew I'd take care of that little package for him. But it was too late. (groaning) Oh, the guards had a mighty good time. Before they shot our brother in the back of the head. (booming) (dramatic music) You Company boys really know how to drain all to the memory banks. When he opened up that satchel, me heart just broke. I heard her crying first. (baby crying) Her tiny lungs fighting to find air but there was none. The poor, wee thing. She couldn't have been more than a month old. (baby crying) Those damned, heartless monsters. What they did... (baby crying) I'll never forget. (baby crying) (gunshot booming) (dramatic music) Come on. - [Fargo] Let's enjoy this. It's not everyday we get to play with our firearms. (suspenseful music) (alarm beeping) (wind rumbling) (door seal hissing) - I didn't know about the kid. - And if you had, would you have cared, Keeper? - Hey, if you found anything, you just better give it to him, old man. - It's all he had on him. That's his Keeper I.D. I went and buried the wee thing. Put her to rest. - Where? - Out there. I could find her but you don't want to see her, Keeper. Like the rest, she weren't right. - What do you mean? - I been here since the start, Keeper. First mission after they nuked the icecap and went greenhouse. First farming when the geo struck Silex. Finest fossil fuel ever. That's crap. And plenty of EPA boys got plenty rich swearing that this planet was safe. You know why their aren't any women on Mars, Keeper? - Company regulations. - Company regulations. (laughing) Company regulations. (laughing) (coughing) (suspenseful music) There used to be children. We had about six of them the first year on Alpha. They wasn't right. The Company shuttered them off. We reckon for some sort of rehab. We never saw them again. - Why don't you quit your jabbering, old man, and get to he crust of the biscuit, okay? Come on! (ominous music) - Billy? Come on down. I've got some folks I want you to meet. - [Billy] Father. (eerie music) - That's it. That's it, wee lad. The Company didn't want folks to see this. They made Billy work here. Said they made a row. Many children buried. Go back up to your room, son. - [Billy] Yes, father. - Easy there, fella, easy. (dramatic music) He's a good boy. He's a good boy. I'm awful sorry about your brother, Keeper. And I wish he'd gotten that girl back to Earth so some doctor could approve what's eating all of us up on this planet. - The Silex. - Of course it's the Silex. - Doc ran a program a few hours ago and she said that's what it was. - Damn straight. - And the Company has been keeping a lid on it and they knew it all along. And it's going to happen on the earth. Silex fumes spewing from every engine on every road. That's why they won't let nobody get off this rock. Sure, they can swing out to the army station but that's nothing but a freaking dead satellite by now. We're trapped here until we die. (ominous music) That's a Company memo from 30 years ago. The president of I.P.C ordering everyone to hush things up. Nice outfit you work for, aye Keeper? Killing kids for profit. (suspenseful music) - [Caution] Nice. - [Pete] They is all antiques. - [Caution] Where'd you get the guns? - It's all from the first landing. You can't buy ammo for it anymore. - Where do you get it? - I made me a reloading bench. Crazy old fool's got to have a hobby. (suspenseful music) These are fun. - [Buckskin] This is some heavy arsenal. - Here you go, boy. - [Buckskin] Thank you. - Take this one, that's good. - [Buckskin] Okay. Oh wee, we're gonna get some action, beau. - Sure you know how to handle it all? - [Caution] No problem. - [Buckskin] Yeah, yeah. Me, I'm a basement bomber by birth. - That may get you as far as the Dome. You're marked men. Nobody who ever took on the company lived to tell about it. May the grace of God be with you. (foreboding music) Get down! (explosion booming) Company bastards! Get off me land! (gunshots booming) (yelling) (gunshots booming) (Buckskin whimpering) (glass shattering) (suspenseful music) - [Buckskin] Go get 'em! (gunshots booming) (yelling) - Down! Nothing I hate worse than dirty mine rats! (Buckskin whimpering) (gunshots booming) - [Buckskin] Beau! Beau! - Come out, come out, wherever you are! (booming) (air tank hissing) - Go! (groaning) (gunshots booming) - Give me the gun. - [Buckskin] Okay! (yelling) Watch it, beau! (booming) - Let's play, Superman! You run and I kill you! (gunshots booming) Come on, die like a good Company dog! It's over, Keeper man. Our boss, Mr. Clement, sent us to kill you! (gunshots booming) Come on, you stinking poochie! Let's play for keeps! (yelling) (booming) (groaning) (bomb beeping) - Way to go, beau! It's gonna blow! It's gonna blow! (explosion rumbling) (suspenseful music) - Excuse me, sir. But maybe we should rethink this. Cool down, some. - Am I taking advice from failed Keepers now? - We took care of Ino. If that would've been the end of it, okay. But why can't we let this brother of his go? Let him take out that animal, Ringo. And he'll be done with it. - We can not afford to take that risk, Chief Bascom. Why don't you just follow your directives? Come on, there's nothing but two loose ends here. Nothing more. One's over there. The company doctor. The other's the Keeper. Now, once both are taken care of, it's back to business as usual. I'll take that as a yes. Now, I'm going out for a stroll. Make sure the women is secure and I'll telecom if I need you. Door open. (suspenseful music) - I'll have you undone here in a minute, doctor. I'll tell you how things got so out of hand. (foreboding music) (moaning) - Bascom. (Doc whimpering) (booming) (crying) Now that's what I call executive action. - [Buckskin] So where we going, beau? I mean, you heard Fargo, right? Clement's behind it all. We going to get Clement, huh, beau, huh? - [Caution] Be quiet. Load this. - Okay. Okay, I'm ready. Let's go. (suspenseful music) You see anything? Huh? You see anything? You see anything? Beau? (suspenseful music) Beau? What're we looking for? - Get back. (gun clicking) (rustling) - Beau! (gunshots booming) (yelling) (yelling) (thudding) (gunshots booming) - Damn! (Buckskin whimpering) - Corner! (booming) Open the bag. - What? - Open the bag! - Okay, okay, open the bag. All Right. (gunshots booming) I can't see! I can't see! - A grenade! - What's a grenade? - Come on, man! (gunshots booming) Ancient thing. Thant's it. - Okay, got it. Now what? (booming) - Pull out the pin. - Okay, pull out the pin. Okay, now what? - Get rid of it. (grenade beeping) (gunshots booming) (yelling) (suspenseful music) (grenade beeping) (explosion rumbling) Come on, let's go! (foreboding music) - [Thug] Come in, Ringo. - Speak! - [Thug] I'm sorry, sir. The Keeper got through. (yelling) (beeping) (buzzing) - This is Clement. - They missed him. They couldn't stop the Keeper. - What do you mean, you missed him? - He's on his way back to the Dome. - That means he'll be coming after me. Ringo, I had better not encounter that Keeper alive! Do you hear me? - Yes, sir, I'll be waiting for him! - Now out! Well, it appears, doctor, that I may need you as an insurance policy. (moaning) What a nice night for a shuttle ride. (suspenseful music) - Hey! You can't-- (groaning) (thudding) (whooshing) (yelling) (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) - Time to die, Keeper! (yelling) (thudding) (electrical fizzling) (ominous music) (thudding) Escape! (suspenseful music) Come to poppa, baby, let's heat things up. (suspenseful music) (Buckskin whooping) (thudding) - That'll keep you to mess with the Junior Keeper. (groaning) (yelling) (thudding) (ominous music) I'm right behind you, beau. No worries. (foreboding music) (yelling) - Looks like your goose is cooked! Damn! (fire whooshing) (screaming) (banging) Ashes to ashes! (screaming) (fire whooshing) (screaming) - Oh, you wanna make a fireball? Listen, I may be a sleazebag but baby killing pisses me off! Get him, beau! (fizzling) Go, beau, go! Come on! (suspenseful music) - Come on, Keeper. Come on. I'll do you like I did your brother. Let's hear you beg like he did. (thudding) I'll cut you. (suspenseful music) (thudding) - Let's go, beau, let's go! - Ino hated you. Hated your guts. Yeah. (thudding) - Yeah! (whimpering) - Go, beau! Take him down! - Where's Clement? - You think you've won, don't you, Order boy? You lost! Clement's on the shuttle. I hope you can fly. Go ahead, huh? Kill me in cold blood. Forget about that holy order, huh? Go on and kill me. You're gonna enjoy it just as much as I enjoyed killing your little brother. Go on, do it! You're just like me! Yeah! (yelling) (ominous music) (gagging) - Beau, you should get triple overtime for that. - Come on, let's move. - Okay! (suspenseful music) Hurry up! What was that shuttle? - [Announcer] Shuttle will depart in 10 minutes. (wind howling) - I want that hover bus now! I can't walk to the blasted shuttled site! No, I don't care about any explosion in a tunnel! - We're almost there. (suspenseful music) - Just get me to that shuttle! - Clement! - Security, get to the shuttle bay. Intruder alert! Security, I need assistance now! Caution, you shoulda stayed out of this, followed your Keeper's Code! You don't understand the complexities in this kind of operation! It's difficult to maintain corporate integrity! - Integrity? - Yes. Security. Structure. The key to survival. Order. - Order? - You are a trader to the Company, Caution. How dare you bite the hand that feeds you? Gives your life meaning. Now you have once chance to save your membership. Serve the Company. Security, arrest this man! (suspenseful music) (knife slicing) (squelching) (suspenseful music) - [Announcer] Attention! Orbit shuttle departs in five minutes. - Hover bus, override! This is Clement! You broke your code, didn't you Caution? You attached yourself to this woman. You forgot, didn't you? A Keeper can never get involved and never care. Can never show mercy. - And never negotiate. - No, I will sacrifice this woman for the greater cause! (thudding) - You okay? How you doing, doc? (screaming) (suspenseful music) (groaning) Where'd they go? - Caution! - Beau? - Caution, stop it! Stop it, Caution, you can't do this! - Why? - You owe it to the Company! It's your job, it's your duty! (groaning) (gunshot booming) (glass shattering) (wind howling) - I quit! (screaming) - Where's Clement? (thudding) (jackhammer buzzing) - He finally joined the working class. Come on. - No, hey, let's see what he left behind. Come on! - [Announcer] Medical alert in progress. Calmly proceed to the shuttle deck for evacuation. (dramatic music) All citizens must evacuate in a calm, orderly manner. - Caution? Caution! Where you gonna go? When you have no family, you have no job, what do you plan on doing now? - Nothing. It's over. - Come on, Caution. It's not over. Please, come back to Earth. The people really need your help. Fight the Company. We still got a few more battles before justice is done. - Beau, skip that! Come to Venus with me. They got a new colony opening up. I mean, you and me, together. Keepers gotta stick together. What, doc? - Nothing. Find a good cause wherever you go. - Looks like it's you and me, beau. Brothers in blood, snow and mud. I hear some of the poochie on Venus is like you've never seen before. We'll be killing out there. Beau? - Hey, doc! - Beau! Beau, I thought we were a team. (somber music) - Thanks. - Beau! Okay, beau. So you've got the hots, here, for the doc. Understandable, but you gotta let the big head do the thinking for the little head. - [Caution] Greenberg. - [Buckskin] Beau, beau, I just had a brainstorm. You Keepers are like the core, right? You probably got the dirt on everyone. So let's sell the story. We'll make millions of credits! - [Caution] I'll tell you the world's greatest secret. - [Buckskin] Yeah, finally! - [Caution] Silence is golden. - [Buckskin] Come on, beau. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (somber music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music)
