(MAN AND WOMAN VOCALIZING) WOMAN: (SINGING) Hark, how the bells, sweet silver bells All seem to say, throw cares away Christmas is here, bringing good cheer To young and old, meek and the bold (CHITTERING) With joyful ring, all caroling One seems to hear words of good cheer From everywhere filling the air (WOMAN VOCALIZING) Ding, dong, ding, dong Ding, dong, ding, dong (WOMAN VOCALIZING) Ooh! (SHOUTING) (SNIFFING) Don't think I don't see you, little one. I think there's enough for both of us, though. - VOICE: (ECHOING) Mary. - (GASPS) (SQUEAKING) (INDISTINCT WHISPERING) Fear not, for you have been favored by God to conceive and bear a son. A... A son? But how? The Holy Spirit will overshadow you, and the child will be called the Son of God. For nothing is impossible with God. Thank you. Do I say thank you? I mean, yes. Let it be done, just as you say. (GASPS) (GASPS) (WHIMPERING) (EXCLAIMING) Guys! Guys! (LAUGHS) You're not gonna believe this! ALL: Whoa! ALL: Huh? (ALL EXCLAIMING) Whoa. Whoa. ALL: (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Whoa. - (IN LOW-PITCHED VOICE) Whoa. - (ALL SHRIEKING) Whoa! (CHUCKLES) Okay. You are not gonna believe this, but I think a new star just appeared in the sky... OLD DONKEY: No, no, no. What have I said about looking through that thing? Come on. Wait. This doesn't happen every day. (GRUNTING) (PANTING) There's nothing out there for you, kid. Things are changing. That star means something. And I'm not gonna be here forever. DAVE: Yeah-yeah! (LAUGHS) Hoo! (BREATHES DEEPLY) I love the smell of freshly ground grain in the morning. Hey, kid, your unemployed bird friend's here. Dave! (LAUGHS) - Hey, pal. - What's new out there today? Mmm. Oh, um, you know, not a whole lot. I mean, it's Nazareth. That rooster on Fifth Street overslept again. And, uh, that horse, uh... What is his name? Jeremiah? Hezekiah? There's an "iah" in there. I know that. He lost a shoe. And then, well... (CHUCKLES) I mean, it's barely worth mentioning, but the, um, royal caravan is rolling through town today. What? The royal caravan? - Are you kidding? - (EXCITEDLY) No, buddy! For real! I spotted them outside of town and had to come straight here to tell you. (LAUGHS) Today's the day we've been waiting for. Nazareth can kiss my gleaming white tail feathers good-bye. (BLOWS) See? I told you that star was a sign. We're meant for something greater than this. This is our job, and once you accept that, you'll be a glowing picture of happiness. Like me. Uh, we're talking about the royal caravan here. It's the ultimate job. (BELLS JINGLING) You get to go from town to town, see the world, visit important people, and you get to march with the biggest, strongest, greatest horses in the world. ALL: Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave! All the animals in every town watching us go by. ALL: Dave! Dave! Dave! And we'll finally be doing something important. - (OLD DONKEY SCOFFS) - Huh? A miniature donkey in the royal caravan? - That'll be the day. - Don't listen to him. And what's a dove gonna do, carry one grape at a time? Hey, at least he's not locked up in a mill like us. I'm telling you, folks in this town just don't get it. And, I could carry two grapes, - one in each talon, thank you very much. - (BELLS JINGLING) Bells. - (GASPS) - Wait. Bells. That's them. (LAUGHS) (EXCLAIMS) It's time to activate Operation Prison Break. Okay. All I have to do is kick this sharp metal killer stick towards my head and duck. It'll cut your harness... And I'll finally be free. Oh, I love Operation Prison Break. - Such a good idea. - Here we go. Oh... - (EXCLAIMING) - Okay, that's not good. Oh, boy. (GASPS) (BLOWING) (SHRIEKS) (SIGHS) (LAUGHS) See? I knew that would work. Just like we planned. (LAUGHS) With a momentary near-death hiccup. Well, old-timer, it's been real. - Good luck to you. - Wait, Dave. We can't just leave him. Buddy, I get where you're coming from, but it's the royal caravan, not the retirement caravan. Look at him. He's like 300 years old. All right. What's going on in... (GRUNTS) - Oh... - Uh... (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Mmm. Now, this ought to keep you where you belong. Hyah! (GRUNTS) You're nothing but a great big, rotten... (BRAYING) Oh, boy. (SIGHS) ...good-for-nothing bully! Yeah, you better walk away. Ah. Who needs the royal caravan? There's plenty of excitement here in Nazareth. (SNIFFLING) I'm gonna be honest. I'm very upset right now. I'm gonna go find someone to poop on. If that miller thinks this yoke is gonna stop me... Ooh, boy, do I have a surprise for him. I'll be riding with kings any day now. You'll see. (GRUNTING FRUSTRATEDLY) Huh. Still no Mary. Okay. Just a little late. It's normal to be late to your wedding feast. Totally normal. Just like it's normal to talk to yourself. ZECHARIAH: There he is! - Hey. - Hi, Joseph. Looking good! (JOSEPH CHUCKLES) Mary. You made it. You look beautiful. So do you. Uh, well, handsome. I've missed you. You're a little late, you know. I was starting to worry. ZECHARIAH: Oh, sorry. That's our fault. We're always late. "We" who? You were driving. She was such a big help to us these past several months. - Wasn't she, John? - Sorry, big guy. I know how great she is, but I'm taking her back. Joseph? There's something I want to talk to you about. Of course. And, just warning you, it might be a lot to take in. Mary, it's our wedding feast. Of course. You can tell me anything. (GASPS) She's here! (ALL EXCLAIMING) Sorry, uh, what did you want to talk about? Oh, it can wait. Let's enjoy the party. So, any new escape plans, kid? What's the point? I'm always gonna be stuck on the same old wheel with the same old view. What's wrong with the view? (SIGHS) I know it feels like we're just going in circles. - We are. - Look, kid. We're mill donkeys. We grind grain. We don't carry kings. Yeah. Should've listened to you and given up a long time ago. (SIGHS) - (STRAINING) - (EXCLAIMS) What is happening? Kid, it's my leg. Go get help. (BRAYING) These good-for-nothing animals. What is it now? - (OLD DONKEY MOANING) - (GROWLS) - Just what I needed. - (GROANING) - Are the gates open? - What? - Yeah. - MILLER: You! What are you doing... (GROANS) Kid, get out of here. Wait, but I thought you said... - What about you? - I'll be fine. I just hope you find what you're looking for. (GASPS) I don't know what to say. You're welcome, kid. Now, get going. - Oh, no, you don't! - (GROANS) You're free, kid. Make it count. (GASPS) (LIVELY CHATTER) What? - Hey! Where do you think you're going? - Huh? - Oh! - Get back here! Look, I'm not gonna be here long. Runaway donkey! Somebody grab him! Sorry, hon. Looks like I'm leaving sooner than I thought. - Never forget me! - (SCOFFS) You broke out! Yes, the dream is back on. Whoo-hoo! See, not free yet. The miller! The miller's on my tail! Yeah, and he does not look happy. I am not happy! Follow me. - This way. Up here. - No, no, not up. No, donkey don't like up! (EXCLAIMING) (SHRIEKING) (GROANS) (GROWLS) - Sorry. Sorry. - (SHRIEKS) I'm a really nice guy. (GRUNTING) Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way! (PANTING) Oh! (GROANS) - What now? - Jump. Jump? What, are you crazy? Just jump! (SHOUTING) (GASPS) A flying donkey! Ah! Well, greetings, ladies. - (GROANS) - (GASPS) (GROWLS) (BRAYING) Wait a second. Are they eating chicken? Ladies, run! (GROWLS) Other way. Other way! (EXCLAIMS) (GROANING) No, no. Where'd you go? (GROANING) Dave? Dave? Where are you? I got you now. (EXCLAIMING) Oh, no. - No, no, no. - There's no way out of this. (GRUNTING) Here we go! (SHRIEKING) (PANTING) (SIGHS) Okay. Here goes. He's a good man. He'll understand. Thanks. Mmm. (CHUCKLES) Zechariah! Party's over. Let's go. Great party, guys. - Bye, now. - Joseph, you must be the happiest man in the world. Or second happiest. Clearly, I'm the happiest. ELIZABETH: You know, I think I liked you better when you couldn't talk. Wow. Our place is a mess. "Our place." I like the sound of that. (CHUCKLES) Me, too. Well, this place isn't gonna clean itself. I'm starting with the dishes. (CHUCKLES) Okay. And I'll start down here. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) (WHISPERS) Where I figure out how to tell him about you. It's all good news. Promise. All good news. (CHUCKLES) - Yep. - (CLATTERING) (GASPS) Hmm? (CLATTERING) (GASPS) - (GASPS) - (SHOUTS) (SHOUTS) I'm caught again. There's gotta be a better hiding place. Okay, maybe not here. Nope, not that one, either. Why couldn't I be smaller? The one time I wish I was smaller. (LAUGHS) Oh, no. - (BRAYING) - (CHUCKLES) You poor thing. - (BRAYING) - You're hurt. What is she doing? That can't be good. (BRAYING) If I'm going to help you, you're gonna have to let me, okay? (CLOTH TEARS) Okay. Huh. Better? Good. Nice to meet you. I'm Mary. Hey. You gonna bring me up any more dishes? - You didn't tell me you had a donkey. - Huh? I don't. No, he must be a stray. Go on, boy. Shoo! (BRAYING) You're scrappy. Scrappy little donkey. Come on. All right, that's how it's gonna be, huh? - (BONES CRACKING) - (SIGHS) (PANTING) (GRUNTING) - MARY: Oh! - (GROANS) - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. It's just a... Oh, well, I'm glad to see that the donkey survived. Poor little guy is hurt. - Give him a break. - JOSEPH: Hello! Has anyone lost a donkey? - Because, if you have, he's here! - What should we call you? And I do not want him! How about... - Wait, what are you doing? - Boaz. You're naming it? What do you think, Bo? Bo? Ugh. No way. Bo's a good name for you. Isn't it? - Isn't it? - Oh, yeah, Bo's great. Love it. Mary, no. No, if you name him, you're gonna start feeling affectionate toward him. And once you feel affectionate, you're gonna want to keep him. And if there is one thing we are definitely not going to do... Do you think he'll be warm enough down here? That's my workshop. Let's just let him stay here till he's all better. Don't you think we should at least... Uh... Uh... Mmm. Um... Mary? Come on. Let's go talk upstairs. Okay... Finally. They are gone, and I am out of here. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTS) (GROANS) DAVE: Oh! There you are. I am so glad you're okay. Do you know how much flying around I have done looking for you? I thought that maybe the miller caught you and was gonna eat you. Eat me? Yeah, I don't think he was gonna do that. You don't know! He had crazy in his eyes. So keep it down. He's still out there someplace. - Do you think he heard? - Nah. I think we're good. This is the last place he'd check. Nothing special ever happens in an old shack like this. The Messiah? You're saying that baby is the actual Messiah? Like from the prophets? I do need to sit down, actually. - (EXHALES) - I know. I know how it sounds, but yes. And God wants you and me to raise him. Me? Are you sure, uh... I mean, did the angel mention me? Well, no, but it's... Look, I can't raise the Son of God. He's a king. I'm just a carpenter. He needs someone with a little more experience being... (STAMMERS) I don't know, king-ish? I mean, who am I? (SIGHS) You're my husband. I am so sorry. This is just so much to take in right now. Can I have a little time? Okay. We got it this time. (GROANING) We're making progress, though, right? Hate to say it, but even if we got you out, you're never gonna make it to the royal caravan on that leg. Dave, look, I don't want to hold you back. You fly ahead without me. I'll catch up once my leg heals. No. We're in this together, and I'm not gonna leave you here. - Friends don't do that. - Are you sure? Yeah, and besides, you'd never make it without me. I am a bird of the world. I know how things work out there. You are a donkey of a barn. A very small, ill-smelling barn. - You need me. - Okay. So, now what? Hide out here until your leg heals, and then just get yourself kicked out. And we'll be back on track, pal. Bo, actually. My name is Bo now. Mary named me. "Bo." Hmm. That's got a nice ring to... Wait. That lady person named you? I said hide here, not settle in and get a name. - Have I taught you nothing? - No one is settling in, okay? Once my leg is healed, it's time for Operation Kick Me Out. Good. Now, I'm an expert at this type of thing, so listen up. Things I found that tend to tick people off. Jumping out and scaring them. Singing really loudly early in the morning. Staring at them while they eat. At the risk of stating the obvious, a well-placed number two. Breaking things. Setting things on fire. Licking things that don't want to be licked. (SINGING) What child is this Who laid to rest On Mary's lap Is sleeping Whom angels greet With anthems sweet While shepherds watch VOICE: Joseph. (SINGING) Are keeping? This, this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard and angels sing Haste, haste To bring him laud The babe, the Son of Mary. (SINGING) Wait a minute! Wait a minute! We three kings Of Orient are Bearing gifts We traverse afar Field and fountain Moor and mountain Hang on! - Following yonder star - Cyrus! Deborah! Come on, guys! Wait up! I expected a left turn two deserts ago. FELIX: I'm dying back here! I can't believe we passed that last oasis. - I'm getting thirsty. - Lost! (SOBS) These wise guys are lost. Wise men don't get lost, Felix. So you're saying they know where this birthday party is? And what makes you so certain it's a birthday party? Oh, here we go. Have you seen the presents these guys are bringing? Gold, myrrh, frankincense. Could be a baby shower. - You bring gifts to a baby shower. - Baby shower? What is a baby gonna do with frankincense, silly camel? It's a birthday party. Mmm. Baby shower. - Birthday party. - Baby shower. Birthday party. - Baby shower. - Birthday party! What if it's not a party at all? What if we're on our way to do something important like, I don't know, meeting the Son of God? Uh-oh. Deborah's crazier than a box of rocks. I believe the expression is, "Dumb as a box of rocks." FELIX: You ever shake a box of rocks? They sound crazy. (SINGING) You're westward leading Still you're proceeding Guide us to the light (PANTING) So floridly written. It makes one wonder how the emperor has so much time for counting his subjects. (CHUCKLES) But if Caesar decrees a census, then a census he will get. Send the royal guard to round up every man and woman. - MAN: Sire. - Let the counting of the sheep begin. Your Majesty, three magi bearing gifts for the king. (BARKING) - Hold it right there, camels. - (CAMELS EXCLAIM) I bet they can play that game we made up. That was fun. What was it called again? "How High." (SNICKERING) - On three. One, two... - (HUMMING) - Three! - (BOTH BARKING) (CAMELS EXCLAIMING) - How high? - Camel high. (DOGS WHINE) Ah. Your gifts are unexpected, though not unwelcome. Um, Your Majesty, these gifts are not for you. Yes, they're for the new king. - What new king? - The one foretold by the star. I knew it. It's a birthday party for the new king. No, no. I'm pretty certain it's a baby shower. Or maybe they're referring to the coming Messiah. The Son of God. Okay, now I'm starting to worry about her. Deborah, are you okay? (STAMMERS) How many hooves am I holding up? (SIGHS) Now bring in my scribes. There is a prophecy. - What are they saying? - Shh. I can't make it out, but it's something about the king of the... Shoes? King of the shoes? That's what this is about? - Mmm-mmm. That can't be right. - Whoa! Look! Look! Dude has gold slippers. King of the shoes, no doubt. That, Felix, is money and no taste. Can we move past the shoes? - I think... - Yo, look at that guy. - You see him? - CYRUS: He's just the royal dog walker. Trust me. Felix, I know these things. FELIX: What? Dog walker? He's like a nightmare wearing a helmet. We must find this king at once. I will set my scribes to the task. In the meantime, I invite you to stay in the palace as my royal guests. No, no, that's not necessary, sire. Oh. But, I insist. Okay. That was sinister. Yep. We're leaving. We're not gonna do any slumber parties with any evil shoe kings. No, thank you. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) (SOLDIERS STOMPING) - (SOFTLY) Too late. - (SOLDIERS GRUNT) This new king is a problem. (CHUCKLES) Get rid of the problem. (BARKING) - The room was filled with magical light. - (ALL EXCLAIMING) And then the angel said that the child would be the new king. ALL: (MURMURING) New king? (CHUCKLES) And I thought, "I'm not ready to be a mom." But then I realized the angel was talking to the lady. - (ALL SHRIEKING) - Wait, wait. I'm not done. That's usually everyone's favorite part. - (GROWLING) - (SHUDDERING) Whoa, whoa! (SHRIEKING) Nice story, rat. Here's how it ends. The end. Rufus, spit it out. We need that rat to talk. Ho! I am not a rat. - I'm a pygmy jerboa. - What's a jerboa? It is in the rodent family but an entirely different species. - Rufus, enough. Spit it out. - (SQUEAKING) Aw! I was just starting to get a little bit of the flavor. (GRUNTING) You've been telling this story to every critter in Galilee. Now it's our turn to hear it. From the beginning. (GULPS) From the beginning? Okay. Uh, well... (NERVOUS CHUCKLE) I was born in a sack of barley somewhere in Capernaum. (GROWLS) Skip to the end! Who's the woman? Her name is Mary. She lives in Nazareth. But, please, don't hurt her. - She's really nice. - Don't worry. We're harmless. (BARKING) Hey! That's mine! (SHUDDERING) Oh, no. Mary! Looks like you're healed up. Feeling better? All I'm saying is it's unfair, you know, to make all these people drop everything for the census. And for us to travel to Bethlehem, especially in your condition. Joseph, I'm not dying. It's just a little road trip. We'll be fine. (SIGHS) This feels right. You know, Mary, most donkeys have to work. You are spoiling him. She is spoiling you. Hey, look at you. - Your leg's all better. - Hey, Dave. All right, time to activate Operation Kick Me Out. What's your plan of attack? Uh, first, I thought I'd let her finish this belly rub. Snap out of it! A little bird named Methuselah told me the royal caravan will be passing through not too far from here. We can catch them if we leave soon. All right, let's get kicked out of here. JOSEPH: All packed up. Is the donkey ready? Yes, his leg looks good as new. Finally. Time for him to earn his keep. All right, Bo, let's get you hitched up to this cart - so you can take us to Bethlehem. - (BOTH GASPING) - Bethlehem? - Bethlehem? DAVE: Not good, not good. The royal caravan is nowhere near Bethlehem. Don't worry. He's gotta catch me first. - Joseph, maybe if you just... - Don't worry, Mary. I've got this. (LAUGHS) Well, looks like you got me. Come here! Ha-ha! - (GROANS) - Ooh! (LAUGHS) - That looked like it hurt. - It did. - (CHUCKLES) How was that? - Bo, look out! (GRUNTING) Come on. See? Under control. (GROANS) - Joseph! - (PANTING) No, no, I'm okay. You know what? We can walk to Bethlehem. - No problem. - (SIGHS) Useless donkey. - Nicely done. - I thought so. Did you see how I laid him out on the ground? Those caravan horses have nothing on you. - Okay, so now what? - Easy. (CHUCKLES) All we have to do is slip through the gate when they're on their way out. No, no, no, don't close the gate! MARY: Don't worry. We'll be back soon. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) BO: I guess that was good-bye? You're not gonna cry, are you? Come on, we gotta figure out a way to open this thing. (GROWLS) (GRUNTS) This is what I get for having a friend who can't fly. You know what? Gates were never a problem before I met you. There's gotta be something we can use here. There's that table, that lumber, those tools. A giant knife. Hide! Hmm. - (SHUDDERS) - Okay, Bo. What haven't you told me? - You been making some new friends? - No. I bet the miller sent them to bring me back to the mill. - (GASPS) They left the gate open. - BO: I'll make a run for it. Dave, you jump out and create a distraction. What? No. Terrible plan. Why don't you make the distraction and I run for it? Because I'm the one trapped in here, and you can fly, - as you like to keep telling me. - All valid points. (SNIFFING) I got a scent. I smell a dog! Thaddeus, there's definitely a dog here. Oh, yeah! Yeah! Oh... - I smell me. - Hey! Scary dogs! You guys here for the show? - What show? - What... (LAUGHS) "What show," the silly dog asks. You're adorable. "The Dance of the Royal Dove," of course. Played in Rome six years. Great reviews. Caesar saw it twice. Made him cry. He won't admit that because, you know, he's Caesar and all. But he definitely cried like a baby. - But I digress. - We don't have time for this. No! Wait! The show is about to start. Okay. You can... (DEEP INHALE) (HUMMING) What are you doing? Don't watch me. (CONTINUES HUMMING) (CHUCKLES) Aw, yeah. This bird can dance. (SNIFFING) (GROWLING) No, guys. Guys, guys, guys, no, this is the best part. Okay, there you go. They're gone. - Where's your owner? - Yeah! Where's your owner? Who, the miller? I don't know a miller. My owner's a nice pregnant lady. You would love her. - That's her. - Where is she? Wait, you're looking for Mary? Did I say "pregnant lady"? I meant "miller." I'm just a mill donkey on vacation. - Who's Mary? - Keep talking. Okay, that was pathetic. Let me handle this, Bo. - Guys, donkeys are stubborn. - Yeah. - He's not gonna tell you anything. - Sorry, guys. You would have to torture it out of him. Wait, what? (GRUNTS) - He didn't bandage himself. - That's her scent. Now we just gotta figure out which way she went. - We'll tell her you said hello. - (SNICKERS) (PANTING) (GASPS) Whoo! They left the gate open. Okay. The royal caravan is right this way. We'll catch it in no time. Wait. Where you going? Dream is that way. - Right, but Mary is this way. - No, no, no, no. Royal caravan cannot wait for a rescue mission. Especially when that guy is after her. He is major bad news. I'm not gonna just let her get hurt, Dave. - She was nice to me. - Aw, come on, Bo. - We've been waiting for this. - It'll just take a second. Once Mary's safe, we'll turn right around - and join the royal caravan. - (SIGHS) - Deal? - (GROANS) Fine! Deal. So we turn right around. Okay, leave this to me. I know a shortcut. - (SIGHS) - (THADDEUS SNICKERS) He'll lead us right to her. - And then what? - Then we find the baby. Oh. That baby messed with the wrong dogs. Nothing scares us. Not even a baby. Right, partner? Just stop. RUFUS: Thaddeus, do you think I'm bad at being bad? (WHEEZING) (PANTING) I got it. Okay, Dave, be honest. - Are we lost? - No. 'Cause this doesn't exactly look like the beaten path. It's a shortcut. Trust me. (GASPS) (SHRIEKING) - Bo? Bo, right here. Look at me, buddy. - (SHUDDERING) Just breathe. Breathe. - Breathe. - (EXHALES) - (SHRIEKS) - Nope. That's it. No more of your terrible shortcuts. We are... Huh? Hey, look. It's Mary. That's them. Guess we'll have to take my terrible shortcut. You're welcome. Whoa, whoa. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) Wait. No, no, no, no. Okay. Come on. Really? - Which way am I supposed to go? - It's a cliff. You go down. (EXCLAIMING) (SHRIEKS) (GROANING) (GRUNTING) - Hi. - Could you help me get down, please? Just let go. - Here, let me. - Wait, no, no, no. (SHRIEKING) (PANTING) - I'm Ruth. - Hi, Ruth. I'm Bo. Hey, Ruth? You're a little close. - You know, personal space? - Oh! Sorry. - Flocking. It's a sheep thing. - (EXCLAIMING) So, what are you doing all alone on a cliff like this? (GROANS) Well, actually, I'm here with my friend, Dave. I'm meeting him at the bottom. We're on the road to Bethlehem so we can catch up with my friend Mary and save her. And once we do, we will be joining the royal caravan. - Ooh! Sounds exciting. - Huh? Well, I guess I'll get back to following the star. The star? You mean the... - You mean that super bright one? - Yeah, that one. Have you noticed how it's been getting brighter? Totally. And the weird way it kind of pulsates. Yes! It's like it's... - Like it means something. - Exactly. Okay, come on. We're almost down. One more chasm. This is really easy for you, isn't it? You got it, Bo. Just don't look down. Ooh... (EXCLAIMS) (SHRIEKING) Okay, great. Now, just... Ooh! Just try to get your hooves in... Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah. Spread-eagle. We're going for a wedge thing here. That's it. You got it. You're a wedge. - How does that feel? - Fantastic. Great. Okay. Next, just lift that hoof and take a step down. - Uh-uh. Uh-uh. No, no, no. - You can do it. Just one hoof at a time. That's it. (SCREAMS) (HUMMING) What is taking him so long? Well, didn't exactly stick the landing, but that was good. You're a fast learner. - Dave? Dave? - I'm under you and in a lot of pain. - Dave? - Yeah. Right here. On your butt. Come on. Let's get moving. (WHEEZING) (COUGHING) (STRAINING) You must be Dave. I've heard great things about you. - I'm Ruth. - Pleasure. Well, we've got places to be, people to save, caravans to join. - See you around. - Thanks, Ruth. Have you, uh, ever been to Bethlehem before? - We've never been anywhere before. - Oh, well, you're in for a treat. The Samaritan Mountains are beautiful this time of year. Deadly steep, but great views. - You've been to Bethlehem? - Are you kidding? I grew up around there. I know all the ins and outs, how to avoid predators and treacherous high cliffs. (SCOFFS) The treacherous cliffs. You're not really considering this, are you? Come on, Ruth. Lead the way. Sheep are usually better at following, but I will do my best. - Let's go, flock. - Yippee. - Felix, come on. - Shouldn't we be sneaking out? Why are we sneaking in? King Herod is up to something. And we are gonna find out what. With the help of a little well-placed distraction. - (CLANGS) - Ooh! (GROANING) (GASPS) Come on, fellas. Hurry. Still no report from my hunter? - Has he found the child? - (STAMMERS) No, sire. But your scribes are ready to present their findings. Well, finally, someone's doing their job. Ah, so tell me where he is. According to the prophecy, Your Majesty, the new king is to be born in Bethlehem. And? That's all? To what family? Who are they? I am the king. Huh. I am the king of Judea. If you people can't find this one child, then I'll just have to kill them all. See? I told you. Shall we send soldiers to track him down? Um, no. You three, come. - It's the wise men. - Hide, quickly. - So, any word of the new king? - Yes. (CHUCKLES) Look for him in Bethlehem. You're free to go. Our humblest thanks, Your Majesty. When you find him, send word to me. I dearly wish to know where he is so that I, too, may honor him (SNIFFING) with a gift. You know, I think he might be up to something. He's using the wise men to track down the new king. Yeah! Plus, did you see him crumple that flower? BOTH: Shush! - We have to warn the new king. - Pack your bags, boys. Looks like we're going to Bethlehem. And now our tour will continue past these pebbles on the path. Watch your step. Watch your step. And watch your step. I blame you for this. (GASPS) There they are. Come on. (GRUNTS) (EXCLAIMS) (GASPS) Mary. Are you sure you don't want to sit in the cart? No, it's hard enough for you as it is. Just let me fix my boot. - I don't believe it. - Really, I'm fine. No, not that. That. Bo? Mary. You're in danger. You need to listen to what I'm about to say extremely carefully. (BRAYING) You ever feel like he's trying to talk to us? Why is he here? Where did he come from? She's not getting it. Okay, uh, new plan. Can you two act like dogs? - What do you think? - Uh, yes. I do a great dog. - Dogs are my fourth best animal. - Great. Just follow my lead. (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) "Look at me. I'm Mary. I'm so pregnant." (IN DEEP VOICE) "I'm Joseph. I'm in a bad mood." Wait, wait, wait. Is that supposed to be me? It's totally you. (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) "Oh, no! Look! Here come the dogs!" (WHISPERING) That's you guys. Oh. Oh! Uh... (PANTING) Woof! Woof, woof, woof. Throw me a stick, and I'll bring it right back. Oh, what's this? It's a tail? - I'm gonna get you. - Seriously? We're doing this instead of the royal caravan? No, Ruth, you're a scary dog. Just be meaner. Oh. Oh? Meaner? You mean like (GROWLS) this! (SHOUTS) (IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Oh, no! They got me! If only a certain donkey had warned me. - (BRAYING) - (BLEATING) There is something seriously wrong with those animals. I think Bo's trying to tell us something. Come on, come on. I think he wants a belly rub. What? No. I mean, yes, always, but not now. Ugh. This is not working. Guys, I hate to break this up, but we've got trouble. - Mama! - Those guys? Yeah, they've been following us since we came down the cliff. Couldn't you have pointed that out sooner? Oh, no. They followed us right to her. Well, why don't we hide in that big flock over there? That's what a sheep would do. Yes. Great idea. MARY: Bo, what are you... - Joseph? - Right behind you. Oh, okay. Wow, you must be really thirsty. I'm gonna grab some water. Do you want some? Sure. Yeah, I guess I'll just take a look at that wheel, then. - Don't carry too much, okay? - I won't. Oh! Sorry. Fresh figs! Get your fresh figs here. I got them. Hello, sir. You look like a man who appreciates fine pottery. I... (CHOKING) MARY: Hurry up. We need three buckets of water. - Do you see anything? - What are we looking for? What... Here we are, minutes away from being chopped into tiny little pieces by a knife-wielding psycho. - We could've been riding with royalty. - Look! They're here. Dave, let's try and lead them away. Ruth, you stay here and guard Mary. If they find her, get our attention. - Yeah. We should have a secret signal. - Sounds great. (CROWD EXCLAIMING) Help me. (GRUMBLES) Oh. Oh, gosh. The signal. Okay. (INHALES SHARPLY) (IMITATES BRAYING) Huh? (GROWLING) Hmm. - Oh, no. - I'll take care of this. Looks like it's up to me. Ha-ha! (SHRIEKS) Nope, too big. Too big. - Ruth, looks like it's up to you. - Me? I knew this day would come. For the flock! (GROANS) (GRUNTS) Huh? (BO PANTING) - MAN: Look out! - (CROWD EXCLAIMING) - No! - MAN: Get back! Get back! - (WOMAN SHRIEKS) - (SPITS) WOMAN: Watch out! (GROANS) MAN: Hold it up! WOMAN: No! (SCREAMING) Yes! - Bo, are you okay? - (BRAYING) - What has gotten into you? - WOMAN: That donkey did it. He destroyed everything. Did you do this? WOMAN: It was the donkey. WOMAN 2: Who owns that? Oh, boy. We stopped him! That went great, right? DAVE: Hey, you big mutts! - Come here. - Hope your boss knows how to swim. You want some of this? (SNARLING) What's the matter, guys? All tied up? (HUMMING) That's it, you're dead. Thank you. Thank you very much. - I hate that dancing bird. - I know. He's so talented. (GROANS) - Huh? - (GROWLS) - MARY: Joseph. - No, no. I do not want that donkey near you or the baby. Go! Get out of here! - Joseph, it's fine. - Fine? Mary, this is not going well, all right? I just promised four people I'd repair the carts that he smashed. Yeah, trying to save her life. Maybe if you pulled the cart, Joseph would want you to stay. JOSEPH: No, he is just too much to deal with. MARY: He's just a donkey. "Just a donkey?" Yeah, he is. Just a good-for-nothing donkey that has only ever brought us trouble. Come on, Dave. Let's go. - Where are we going? - Where do you think? To join the royal caravan. Where we'll finally do something important. (GASPING) Hey, Bo, wait a minute. What about the star? It means something. You said so yourself. You follow the star. I'm done with that. But what about our tiny flock? Flocks stick together. We're not a flock. I never should have followed you. Bo? Bo! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Hmm... (CROWD EXCLAIMING) We're gonna die. We're gonna die! We're gonna live. We're gonna live! (BARKING) Someone's gonna die. (SINGING) Why should I feel discouraged? Why should the shadows come? Why should my heart be lonely? And long for Heaven and home? I sing because I'm happy I sing because I'm free His eye is on the sparrow And I know He watches me. (BELLS JINGLING) (GASPS) Is that the royal caravan? I can see them! (BO PANTING) Whoa! Huh? DAVE: Royal caravan-van-van-van-van! The royal caravan! Whoo-hoo! - Dave? - (LAUGHING) I don't think I can go with you. Of course you can. What do you mean? Look, um... I know we've always talked about joining the royal caravan, being a part of something important, but now that we're here, I don't think this is it. You know, Mary may not be big and royal, but she's important. She's important to me. I know this was our dream, and even though I can't come, I think you should go. Say hi to the horses for me. - Oh, come on. - No, really, I mean it. Bo, yes, you're right. The royal caravan was our dream. But the best part was that it was gonna be us. If all I wanted was to flap around a bunch of fancy wagons, I could have gone and done that a long time ago. I mean, I can fly, you know? You realize that? Yeah. I guess so. Look, you lead the way, and wherever you go, your best friend Dave will be right behind you. You ready? (CRACKING) - No, no, no, no, no. - Let me help. - Mary, you're in no condition to help. - Stop saying that. - I'm fine. - No, you are not fine. - None of this is fine. - Joseph, God chose us. But why? Why us? Look at us. We'll be lucky just to make it to Bethlehem. And we're supposed to raise the Son of God? Uh, this must be part of God's plan. Well, so far, this plan is going great. I can't wait to see what happens next. (SINGING) Mary, did you know That your baby boy will one day walk on water? What are you looking at? Mary, did you know That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters? Lord, I can't do this. All right? I am not the father of a king. I'm just a carpenter. Please, give me a sign. This child that you delivered will soon deliver you Huh. (CHUCKLES) Really? The donkey? Hey. Stop it. Mary, did you know? Mary? BO: Hi, Ruth. Look, I'm sorry for what I said back there. It was mean, and... I'm glad we followed you. You know, that night I saw the star, I tried to get my old flock to follow me, but they wouldn't. And so I struck out on my own, which has been hard 'cause, well, I'm a sheep. Thank you for coming back. - Can you help me with these? - Of course! You're back! (CHUCKLES) - Oh, sorry, personal space. - Ah, come here. (SIGHS) Mary. Are you okay? I am so sorry. (SIGHS) No, Joseph. You were right. I was? About what? (SOBBING) This is hard. Trust me, I know it is. Just because God has a plan doesn't mean it's going to be easy. And that scares me. Hey. I'm scared, too. But I'm here. And I am yours. And I will give everything that I have to keep you and the baby safe. I mean, I may not have a lot... (SNIFFLING) Oh. Speaking of which, what happened to all our stuff? Oh. Uh... (BRAYING) (MARY GASPS) - (CHUCKLES) Bo! - JOSEPH: I always liked that donkey. I always did. I didn't say it enough. That's true. - Ah. Ooh! Hello. (GROANS) - Did the baby kick? No, that was something different. Different? What "different"? Like, baby's coming now? We've got some time, but, yeah, I think so. Okay! Nobody panic! I've got the clothes. I've got the bag. I've got the sheep. Why do I have the sheep? Bo, can you carry her? (SINGING) One dark night Something said follow the light So you look up and see the word That's written upon the sky Strong and wise Keeping the Lord as your guide And through the doubt you realize He's with you all the while Follow that star above you Should the world try to break you down There is one who waits for you Though you can't see Him now Thunder and rain surround you But His love's just a breath away If you follow your heart, follow the light Follow that star If you follow your heart, follow the light Follow that star (THUNDER CRACKING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) (SINGING) I have traveled Many moonless nights Cold and weary With a babe inside And I wonder All right. Shall we? What I've done (STRAINING) Ooh! All right, buddy, just wait here, and we'll be back out in a second. DAVE: And they're inside. (SIGHS) Thank goodness. This has been so stressful. (EXCLAIMS) I don't know how we held it together. RUTH: Well, we made it. Safe and sound in Bethlehem. (CHUCKLES) Something's not right. Oh! Excuse me. Huh? (GASPS) You. - No, no, no. - Easy. Easy, boy. It's okay. Just hold still. Let me go! No, you don't, crazy-eyed, donkey-eating miller. - That's my best friend! - (GRUNTS) - Move on! - Dave! Dave, are you okay? Where did they go? Who was that? Bad news. - I'm sorry. The inn is full. - What? But, no, can't you see she's about to have a child? What can I do? Blame the census. Uh... You know what? We will pay double. Just hold that thought. I'll be right back. - Um, I left the money with Bo. - Joseph? Bo? Where's Bo? Joseph, we're running out of time! Mary. (WHIMPERING) Bo... Bo, where are you? Ruth, I know we have had our personal issues, but we need to set them aside and find Bo. We have personal issues? Dave, I think you are a delight. I am a delight. Thank you for noticing. Okay, time to activate Operation Rescue Bo. (SNIFFING) She's here. Down the street. Try them. You don't understand. We just came from there. (SIGHS) Sorry. Where do we go now? (INHALES SHARPLY) We will find a place. We just have to keep looking. So this is Bethle-ham. It is pronounced "Bethle-hem." - That's what I said. "Bethle-ham." - "Hem." "Hem." As if you're clearing your throat. - Boys. - That's what I've been saying. - You need to get your ears checked. - Boys, focus. The new king's in danger. Right. Let's go find him. (GRUNTING) They've secured our restraints. Yeah, and they tied us up, too. We have to find the new king. Wise men indeed. Okay, okay, think. What do kings look like? In most cultures, a king is set apart from the plebeians with an ornamental headdress. A ornamel what? They wear hats. Ooh? (SHOUTING) They're coming for you, Your Majesty! Run for your life! - (GRUNTING) - (SHRIEKS) - Run like the wind! - Will you cut that out? We'll never find him tied up here. - We have to go out and search. - That's it. I'm biting through the reins. Don't you dare. That is fine Corinthian leather. Do you have any idea how much that cost? - You kidding me? - No, he's right. (SIGHS) Well, we'll have to untie these knots ourselves. Just follow my instructions. First, Felix, we'll need you in the middle. Deborah, on the left. - Excuse me. Pardon me. - No. - Let me... Move. - No. Over. - Would you move? - The other way. - Sorry about that. Sorry. My bad. - I got it. - Move. - No, around. No, the other... - The other left. - Stop! Would you stop pinching me? - (GRUNTING) - (BRAYING) Come on. Come on. No, no, no. Don't do this. Please! (BRAYING) (GRUNTING) I can't let them down. I could try praying. Let's see, um... Okay, how did Mary do this? Never mind. (SIGHS) It's fine. God? Hello? Um, I don't really know how this works or if You listen to prayers from donkeys, but I've seen Mary do this many times, and I don't know what else to do. My friends need help. I thought, if I followed the star, it would lead me to where I'm supposed to be, but I failed them. What do you want me to do? (SIGHS) ZACH: Begone! Away with you! - (GASPS) God? - Huh! Now it's talking back. There's nothing to fear, Zach. It's all a figment of your imagination. This really realistic vision of a donkey who's talking to God - and won't stop eyeballing you. - EDITH: Zach. - (SHRIEKS) - Pull yourself together. - Ow! - What's your name, sweetie? Bo. Bo is a funny word. Bo, Bo, Bo. - Bo, Bo. - What? - (SING-SONG) Bo, Bo! - He has a name? - And she's singing him a song? - I'm doomed. - Bo! - I kind of like that. They're not usually like this. You caught us at a bad time. (LAUGHS) We haven't slept in nine months. - Nine months? - Not a wink. Oh! So that explains your eyes. What? What's wrong with my eyes? Nothing. Yep, no sleep at all since that giant night light turned on. - Light? - All you can do is lie awake and listen to the crickets. Ta-da. (SINGING GRACEFULLY) Oh. (CLEARS THROAT) Sorry. So excited. Zach and Edith don't like the spotlight, but I think it's beautiful. It's here. I can't believe this. - Me, neither. - You don't understand. That light, that's the star. This is where it's been leading me. But Mary... Joseph... Guys, I gotta get out of here. (GRUNTING) - Can you help me? - I got you. I'm gonna chew him free. (GRUNTING) - Woody. - No. Try biting the... I know! I'll sing you free. (SINGING) That was beautiful, but not helpful. (LISPING) I think I got a splinter in my tongue. - (SINGING) - (GRUNTING) Step aside. (ZACH GRUNTING) (EXCLAIMS) Yes, yes! That's perfect. Now I just gotta get past that gate. (GROANS) Uh... Has that ever worked for you? No, actually. Come on. Up you go. Thanks, guys. Gotta run. Mary's having a baby! - A baby? - I love babies. Bring 'em back here. There's plenty of room in the stable.

We need to find help. - You can count on us! - We won't let you down! - (CHOKING) - (BARKING) They went that way. (GASPING) (SIGHS) What are we doing? We're not gonna stop those giant, scary dogs with a fluffy sheep and a tiny donkey. Even with a very masculine and brave dove. We need backup. Where do you find a dog-eating hippopotamus in Bethlehem? (GROANS) A three-headed camel? Nice. Help! Help! Help! Anybody! Oh, look, a flock of sheep. That kind of looks like my... (SHUDDERING) Oh.
