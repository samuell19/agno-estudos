(70's action music) (ambulance siren) - It's Bruce Lee. They're waiting in emergency hurry. - The actor? - And how. (70's action music) - Hey, that looks like, ya know. - Bruce Lee. I heard they brought him in. (shrill music) (soft dramatic music) - See if you can get a heartbeat. (soft dramatic music) - Nothing doctor. His heart has stopped beating. - Nurse! Get me a syringe of adrenaline quickly. (soft dramatic music) - Here. Hi. May I speak to Professor Lucas, please? Hello Professor. This is Collin at the SBI. - SBI? Ah, yes. Special Branch of Investigation. What can I do for you, Mr. Collin? - [Collin] We want to meet with you. - I imagine it's rather important. - [Collin] Very important, sir. - Couldn't you be a little more explicit? - I'm afraid not, sir. You see, it's a matter of security. Highly confidential. - [Professor Lucas] I see. - I am allowed to tell you this much. It concerns Bruce Lee. - [Professor Lucas] The film star? - Yes sir. (urgent, dramatic music) - Ah, great pity. - Yes sir. It is. - Dr. Wong? I'm Collin of the SBI. I phoned you earlier. This is Professor Lucas. Doctor, how long has he been dead? - Ah, not long. 20 minutes. - I am sorry. Professor, he's all yours now. I only hope that what we're attempting will work. - I will do my best. Doctor, may I trouble you for an empty syringe? - Yes. (anxious orchestral music) (bright trumpeting) - Here's the seven o'clock news. Bruce Lee, the world famous film star died last night of a sudden heart attack. He was rushed to the hospital in a coma. - He was at the very height of his career. His most recent movie had broken all previous box office records. The world indeed has lost one of it's greatest heros. - [Voiceover] As the news of his death has been received, movie fans throughout the world reacted with shock and disbelief. Many suspected foul play, but medical experts assure us that his death was caused by sudden heart failure. - A special memorial service will be held by Bruce Lee's family, close friends and colleagues. A second service, which members of the public may attend will be announced later. - The clones of Bruce Lee. What a scientific achievement this will be. Three of them, eh professor. Do you really think you can do it? - Yes, I think I can Mr. Collin. - Good luck, sir. - Our subjects seem to be doing quite well. Three Bruce Lee's (laughs). Yes. Take him back and bring in Bruce Lee number two, would you nurse. - Yes sir. (monitors beeping) - That's fine. You may attach Thortal injections. - Very good sir. (monitors beeping) (monitors beeping loudly) - Well professor. Your report stated that you're almost done. - (laughs) Yes, with this phase of the program. - That's good. (anxious music) - Are you ready, nurse? - Yes sir. (monitors beeping) - Ah, good. (laughs) - Professor, his eyes are open. - You now have a new life. Your name is Bruce Lee 2 and you will do as I say. - Yes sir. - Take him to the recuperating room and send in Bruce Lee 3. - Yes sir. Right away. (laughs menacingly) - So far, so good. (laughs menacingly) - You may place the head plate on him now. - Yes sir. (monitors beeping) (laughs menacingly) - I will command you. I and I alone. You will do whatever I say. Your name is Bruce Lee 3. - Yes sir. - (laughs) Only one to go, nurse. (monitors beeping) - Professor, he's woken up. - You will obey my command. You will do whatever I say. Your name is Bruce Lee 1. Start the training. ("Gonna Fly Now") - Alright now. We'll see just what you two have learned. - Yes sir. - Hmm. You two are showing good style. Now you will try it against me. Bruce 3, you first. (kung fu fighting) - Hmm. Very good. (kung fu fighting) - Bruce 2, it's your turn. (kung fu fighting) - Now both of ya at the same time. (kung fu fighting) - (laughs) That's good. You're learning fast. - Now! The first five techniques are Dragon, Tiger, Snake, Panther, Crane. These five you will master. The Dragon and Snake consistency. The Panther and Tiger use great strength. The Crane, agility. (high energy 70's music) (kung fu fighting) - Hm. Very well. Let us see what you have learned. Bruce 3, step away. Bruce 2, you may begin when you like. - Yes sir. (kung fu fighting) - Ha! Very good. Continue. (kung fu fighting) - Good. You learn quickly. Keep going. (kung fu fighting) - Yes, they've finished their training. In fact, I would say they are ready to go to work. - And none too soon. Number 1's first assignment will be to get rid of Mr. Chi Lo. - The producer? I've heard of him. Seems pretty drastic. - Yes. With good reason, professor. Chi Lo may seem like any other respected, prosperous business man living in a big house. He's quite religious, that's true. He prays every day at the Buddhist Temple. But underneath his elaborate facade, he's one of the most unscrupulous men alive. That film company of his is no more than a front for a gold smuggling racket. Number 1's will be to first infiltrate Chi Lo's organization and then-- - Sir, Mr. Chang would like you to come and take a look at the new boy over at the studio. - Oh? We'll go there now. - Yes sir. (shrill music) (squealing tires) - Sir, I believe they're shooting inside. - Well, let's go in. (determined music) - Action! (determined 70's action music) (kung fu fighting) - Cut! Good. Print that. Set up the next one. - Yes sir. You're in this, as well as you. Get over here. You feel okay? - Yeah, fine. - Okay. You're over here and you're over there. (insane laughter) - There's the new boy. He's terrific! - Dummy! - I think we got us a winner. - Yeah. - The boy's great. What now? - Mr. Chi Lo! - Oh Chi Lo! Get up! Get this gentleman a chair! (insane laughter) - Please, sit down. - Here you are, sir. - Oh, thank you very much. - So whaddyou think? You think he's star material? - Yeah. Could be, could be. - Ahh. - Alright fellas. Let's get ready to shoot. OK Chan. Ready? - Ready. Alright guys, let's do it. - You got it. - Make it good. - Watch the way this boy moves. Action! (kung fu fighting) - Cut! Well? What'd you think? - He's terrific! - Well? - Hmm. Good. - Let's try that again from another angle. - Okay. Okay look, get those kicks a little higher, huh? Let's get ready to shoot! - Put the camera over there! - Get the camera over here. - Now put something into it. Action! (kung fu fighting) - Cut! You just watch. When this picture comes out, his price will go up. - Yeah. - He's terrific! (insane laughter) - Alright! We shoot the next sequence, Chan. Move it! Move it! (kung fu fighting) - Ah! - Here's a still we took of him. Looks good, doesn't he? - Yeah, not bad. - We still gotta run a check on this guy. - You mean you haven't checked him out? He's good enough to be an undercover agent, Chang. - A spy? - Exactly. And why not? We knew that sooner or later they'd try to infiltrate us. The most important thing right now is to move that gold out. - Yeah, yeah. I agree with you. You're right as usual. So, what you want us to do with the guy? - We can't take any chances. Whether he's legit or not doesn't matter. I want you to get rid of him, fast. You do understand? - Oh, I hate to lose him. Okay, who do you suggest that we use? - White Panther and Quick Tiger. (ominous music) (kung fu fighting) - You'll pay for that you dirty-- kill! (kung fu fighting) - You alright? (kung fu fighting) - (ominous music) (kung fu fighting) (dramatic 70's music) (humming) (choking) - Where's the chief honcho, Chi Lo? - Office. - Thanks! - Those two stupid idiots. They're both out of commission all because of one man. That does it! I want him killed! - I don't think he'd connect us with either of those two men. Oh, you know we go ahead with the film as planned and shoot him in front of the camera. - That's the best idea you've had. It will be the shortest career in history. - That's great. We can capitalize for years on his death when this picture comes out. - And while you're shooting his big death scene, I will be digging the gold out of the ground. Burying it there was a clever move. - Hey, I was thinking. Maybe we could time this kid's death with someone like Bruce Lee. You know, kid's idol and all that? Yeah, I like the way that sounds. We could tie it in good. - Unless Wing Chow and Pei Ming meet up with him tonight and kill him. - I told you I want him dead. That's an order. No matter what. - Hey, come on. I was kidding. All I want is my share of the dough. It's an idea, that's all. - Good! And after this run we'll lay low for a while. Things are getting too hot and I don't like the idea of getting burned. Not that your idea isn't a good one. (laughter) - Killing him in front of the camera. My God that is good! (laughter) (whistling and humming) (kung fu fighting) (pained moaning) - So what's so important that brings you here, Nancy? - Maybe it was my own idea. - Your own idea? - I'm just kidding. Actually, I was sent here by the professor. - The professor, huh? Nancy, I really don't trust that man. - I agree with you, but the message that I have is important. They've heard Mr. Lo is taking out the gold tonight. - I already know. I have a little score to settle with Chi Lo. - Be careful! He's dangerous. - Well, didn't know you cared. - Stop fooling around. Hey, he means business. You could be killed. I know you have a score to settle, but be careful. - I will. (determined music) - Cut! Print that. That was good. Move the camera where I showed you. Alright, now this is the action. You're walking down a hill in the jungle. - The two of us? - It's a long shot. Yes. Now you'll need knives for this. Here. Carve one of those. Move it! Move it! What are you doing? We're not going to-- Oh let me show you, we're going to pan down on them. The top of that tree! But what do you think you're doing-- - But you said - Get that sorted out. I'm surrounded by imbeciles! Alright! Camera! Action! - Come on! Get up! (kung fu fighting) - Cut! We'll do it again. Chao! - We're gonna use a tighter lens on this shot so I can stand right here and watch it. - Oh. Okay. - You two have to work a little closer, alright. Ready? Camera. Action! (kung fu fighting) - Keep digging. Keep going. You're almost there. Put your backs into it! We haven't got all day! - Alright. This is the last one so let's make it good, huh. Ready! - Alright. Ready on set. Camera. Action! (kung fu fighting) (menacing 70's music) (kung fu fighting) - You're mine now. All of you! - We have no time to lose. Kill! (kung fu fighting) (high energy 70's music) (kung fu fighting) - (laughter) Now that we've uncovered the gold, we must get it to the boat quickly! (laughter) (kung fu fighting) - Chi Lo. We got trouble. - Oh really? I wonder sometimes what you're good for. Alright, what is it? - The new guy. The one you think is an agent? He's winning. He really is. He's winning. - You fool! Shut up! Our first concern is the gold. After that, we'll worry about what we'll do with him. You realize, of course this is all your doing? Alright, let's get that gold on the ship. Move out! - Move it! Move it! Move it men. Move it! (pained moaning) (kung fu fighting) - Let's go, let's go! (high energy 70' music) (laughing) - That's the last of them. You boys did a good job. Oh Chi Lo, they're coming! - Oh, get ready to weigh anchor. (high energy 70's music) - He's aboard. What do we do? - Yes. Get him! - Go! Get him! (kung fu fighting) - Do not fear. He will die. (kung fu fighting) - I'd like you to meet Bruce Lee 2 and Bruce Lee 3. - Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you. Alright gentlemen. I am here to brief you. You're going to Thailand, Bangkok. - Yes sir. - Your mission is to eliminate a certain Dr. Nye. A brilliant scientist, but quite mad. And very dangerous. The bulk of his money comes from narcotics which he processes in his own laboratories. We intend to cut off this source. Hence, his elimination. Your contact in Bangkok is Charles Lee Singh. One of the local SBI boys. Well, that's it gentlemen. Good luck and good hunting. - Bruce? - Yeah. - Hi. Sorry I'm late. I had things to do. You know how it is. - So you're Charles Lee Singh? - Yeah, call me Chuck. - Alright Chuck. It's a pleasure to know ya. Where's two? - Oh, I left him over at the hotel. He said he wanted to rest up. - That's understandable. - Yeah. - Me. I wanna see the sights. What I'd really like to do is go swimming. - Okay. I'll take you to a great little beach that I know. (relaxing 70's music) (gasp) - Hey what the--? Who are you? What are you doin' in my bed? - I was sent here by a friend to entertain you. Sorry if I've embarrassed you. I was only doing my duty. I'm sorry. - Yeah? Well who is this friend? - I swore I would not reveal his name, sir. - Alright. Put your clothes on. And get outta my room. (screaming) - One of Dr. Ny's women. (screams) - You were lucky. She had orders to kill you. Chuck found out about it. - And we may not be so lucky next time. - Thanks, Chuck. That's one I owe you. So where is this doctor Nye? - We've located his laboratory. It's near the border. - Well, so far so good. What now? - Well now we go after him. There's a shipment of drugs on the way up to his place right now. And we'll be there to meet it. - And we'll catch him right in the act. (suspenseful music) - Come on! Hurry it up! - Whooowee! Looks like we got here just in time. - Let's get a little closer. - Alright. Let's go. (70's action music) (kung fu fighting) - So much for them. Let's get in the house. - After you. (suspenseful, dramatic music) (kung fu fighting) - Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Good afternoon, Dr. Nye. - Well, how is it working out? - Oh, excellent. Excellent, Dr. Nye. Even better than we expected. It destroys vegetation almost at once. It is incredible, Dr. Nye. I'm sure you'll be pleased. - (laughs) Soon I will conquer the whole world! - Yes sir. It is a privilege to work for you. And an honor. The whole world will welcome you as their leader. Oh Dr. Nye, may I thank you for letting me work for you? - Well spoken. But you must learn to be quicker. To accomplish what I have planned, I need hard workers. The ones who are slow and weak will die. (evil laughing) (nervous laughing) - Silence! Secret brand solution. We have yet to test it out. Then I can attack the whole world! (evil laughing) - Bronze soldiers. That will surprise the world. (laughing) - Now, you are to go back to work. I wanna see some results. I'm certain you won't let me down. (laughing) - Today we conquer Thailand and tomorrow the entire world! (evil laughing) - Dr. Nye, Dr. Nye! Three men have broken through our guards and they're somewhere on the grounds. - Well, who are they? - That's it. Nobody has the faintest idea. Although two of 'em fight like Bruce Lee. - They do, eh? This sounds like the work of the SBI. Hmmm. I'm gonna have to change my plans a little bit. Stall them. (scared gasps) - Where is Dr. Nye? - I don't know. I don't know anything. - Alright, get 'em! (kung fu fighting) (pained moaning) - Where is Dr. Nye? - I don't know, please. I don't know anything. - You want some of this? - Please no! (pained screaming) - Talk you animal! (pained screaming) - We almost had 'em. Now we have to start all over. - Yeah, you're right. - I sure hope Chuck comes up with something. - Next time Dr. Nye won't be so lucky. - Yeah, I agree. (whistling) - Hi! Glad to see you're both here. - So what's the word? Did you find out where he's hiding? - Sure did. Seems he's got an alternate place up north. An old factory. Set it up with a complete laboratory. I'll take us a couple of hours to get there. - Well, let's get started. - Right! (suspenseful 70's music) (laughing) - It works like a dream. Keep a good hold on his arm. Who could ever have imagined it? Discovery of the century. Turning human beings into metal. Bronze! Nothing can stop me now! I hope those three intruders find their way up here. Give my pets a chance to work. (evil laughing) - Let's see how hard they are. Hit 'em! (hitting metal) Good. Very good! (hitting metal) Very good indeed! Now let us see how they fight. (hitting metal) (chiming Asian music) - Hello Dr. Nye. Did you have a hard day? - Yes. - So sorry. Perhaps we can calm you a little bit. - That is why I keep you around. Soon I will be world leader. (laughing) - But what will happen to us after that? - Sit down. - Yes sir. - Do not worry your pretty little head about that now. Rose, dance for us. (70's slow dancing music) (laughing) - They're here. Don't worry. Let's get inside the place. We'll find our man in there somewhere. - Alright, lead the way. (70's action music) (kung fu fighting) - Come! (70's action music) - Seems they don't want us here. - We're uninvited guests. - We'll be alright. As long as we stick together. (kung fu fighting) (hitting metal) - Let's get outta here. Come on! Felt like I was hitting men made out of steel. One of Dr. Nye's inventions, no doubt. - Yeah, I agree with you. There must be some way of beating them. - Yeah, but let's do our thinking somewhere else. - I'm with you. - Dr. Nye! - What is it Gillen? - They ran away, Dr. Nye. Shall we go after 'em sir? - They run and they hide. They're frightened of my steel men. (laughing) - Dr. Nye, what do you want us to do? Do you want us to go after 'em? - Yes. I want them eliminated. - Yes sir. I understand, sir. - Well what are you standing here for? Go on! - Let's go! (70's action music) - What are you doing here? (kung fu fighting) - Oh my God! Don't cry. Don't hurt my children! (kung fu fighting) (thrilling music) - Oh my God! Wake up! Oh my God, he's eaten the poisonous plant! Wake up! Wake up, mister! - The poisonous-- - It's no use. He's dead. - Did I hear you say those plants were poisonous? - It's all my fault! They were for the garden. I was going to use them for fertilizer. That's what they're for. But I never dreamed that this would happen. - He's not worth your tears. And you are not responsible for his death. The one who is will pay for it! (70's action music) - Where's Dr. Nye? Well, they don't seem to understand one word. You guys know what to do. Well fella's, here we go. (70's action music) (kung fu fighting) - So, we meet at last. Kill them! (kung fu fighting) - No wait! Take it easy, take it easy! I'll give you anything you ask. Don't kill me. Please, please. I beg you. I'll give you anything you--no don't kill me! No, don't kill me! (punching) - They have done a magnificent job. And to you sir, congratulations. You have our deepest gratitude for the contribution you have made against crime. - Well thank you. That's very kind. - My pleasure, sir. - He had the nerve to stand there and offer me simple congratulations for one of the world's greatest discoveries. Why that insignificant little pipsqueak! I'll show him! In fact, I'll show the whole world. Only I can control them. But I only want one of them. The best one! Now to find which one it is, they'll fight each other. And then I will show them all. Am I not a genius? (evil laughing) - Yes professor. You're something. - Number one and number three, you will proceed to the main garden. Number one and number three, proceed to the main garden. You will commence fighting with each other. It is to be a fight to the finish. I command you. (kung fu fighting) - Remember, you will fight to the death and the winner will be the king. And I will control the king. (evil laughing) - Nancy! My God, what is it Cathy? What's the matter? - The professor's gone mad. He's already ordered two of the Bruce Lee's to fight each other. To fight to the death. - How can we stop it, Cathy? - The magnitator, we'll cut it. Hurry! (kung fu fighting) - Number two, attack one and three. (kung fu fighting) - You are to fight to the death. Only one victor. (kung fu fighting) - The magnitators are located somewhere around this area. Now once we've found the wires, all we have to do is break the contact. - Okay, let's get to it then. - Okay. (70's action music) (kung fu fighting) - Hey, stop fighting! Stop! There's no need to anymore. You've been freed. All the magnitators are cut. The professor's been trying to kill you. He's gone mad. He's no longer capable of controlling you. Alright? We'll ask Catherine. Cathy, they don't believe me that the professor's gone mad. Would you tell them? They think I've gone crazy. - What she says is true, but now it's alright. - I guess we owe you some thanks. - Yeah, we sure do. If it weren't for you two, we could have killed each other. - But now I think we should contact Mr. Collin and they'll go after the professor. (suspenseful 70's music) (70's action music) (kung fu fighting) (suspenseful 70's music) (kung fu fighting) - You want him? You have to get by me. - So be it. (kung fu fighting) (suspenseful drum music) (kung fu fighting) (shrill, suspenseful music) (kung fu fighting) (suspenseful music) - Someone has disconnected the magnitators. Catherine! Nancy! Answer me. Where are you? (suspenseful music) I thought so. - What is it? - The wires are gone that's what. All three of them have turned against me. You're the only one left that I trust. - I will protect you. They will be punished. - You are the only one left. I'm relying on you to kill them all. - Be careful. (screaming) - So much for Bruce Lee number three. (evil laughing) - Oh my God, what happened to him? He's dead. The death light. It covers that whole area. - It does? And the laboratory's behind that wall? (suspenseful music) - No wait! You must listen to me. Attack the others. I command you. - You command nothing. You've abused your power. You're no longer fit to go on existing. You're a menace. To yourself and to the world. And now you will die. - No, no, please. Think of what you're doing. Why I created you! (kung fu screams) (kung fu fighting) (suspenseful music) (kung fu fighting) (70's action music) - Go ahead. - Alright, take him. - You're hurting my arm. (70's action music)
