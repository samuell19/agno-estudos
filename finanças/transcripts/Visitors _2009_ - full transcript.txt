My grandfather's dead. Hasedera. We will soon arrive in Hasedera. - Here. - Thanks. Are you hungry? I am. Thank you. Do you have children? Yes. In Korea. Ben! Ben! Welcome. - Here. - Thank you. Have some. My grandfather... had a dying wish. He asked me to return this hanging scroll. I see. And? Um... That's all he told me. I don't know why he wanted me to return it. He didn't tell me anything. He just wanted this returned. I have something to give to you as well. Wait a moment. I'll go and get it. What? OK... Shall we go for a walk? What? The sunset... I don't mind, but your father... We'll come right back. What's your name? Why? Why? What do you mean ''Why?'' What's your name? Hatsuko. Yours? Junil. What? Kang Junil. That low mountain in the distance is Mount Miwa. - Miwa? - Yes. Never heard of it? Miwa. Miwa. Miwa. It's the mountain of a divine spirit. There's a scary spirit there. A divine spirit. Ever hear the story of the woman who married the spirit? No, how could she marry a spirit... they don't exist. Never heard it? No, never heard it. There was a couple, but the husband only appeared at night. The wife was sad and wanted to know where he went. So she attached a threaded needle to his clothes. She found the needle, stuck in a branch of one tree. And the two never saw each other again. You think it's funny? Well, what can I say... It's cold. It's gotten cold. Let's go. When I was a baby, I spiked a fever once. Your grandfather carried me to the doctor in the night. My father told me. In thanks, my grandfather gave him a scroll, the one you've returned to me. Ah, That's something. My father said the scroll depicts an ancient Korean king. Your grandfather gave this fan in return. Have you heard any stories about this fan? - No. - From your grandfather... No, not at all. It might be a fan from home... from Korea. But I don't know. You must be hungry after Hatsuko dragged you all around. - Eat up. - Thank you. Eat a lot. She's always like that. No, it's OK. I didn't mind going. - Really? - Sure. Dad, do you really trust me? Of course. How can you answer so easily? I'm sorry, but can I say something? Sure, go ahead. My parents and my grandfather never trusted me at all. But they... covered for me. I don't really like the word ''trust.'' Sorry, I know it's not my place. No, it's fine. That's not what I'm saying. Why didn't you hit me, get mad at me? There was no point in hitting you. Don't cry. Why cry over that? Anyway, I'll be going. Thanks for dinner. I'll be going. You're going? Stay the night here. Sleep here. It's late. Breakfast isn't breakfast, without pickled vegetables. You have to have pickles with every meal. You like them so much. They're really good. Try some. Don't they make a great sound? That cruch... indescribable. Your grandfather must have eaten hese pickles too. I bet he did. They're delicious. Hatsuko's not eating? - Hatsuko? - Yes. I'll eat. This is really steep. Where are we going? Vegetables? This is my mother's garden. She makes pickles from these? Awesome. Leeks. - Leeks? - The smallest ones are leeks. Green onions, cabbage... radish, turnip leaves, potatoes. What else? Spinach, shirona and crown daisies. Give me your hand. - What? - Your hand. Why? I'll give you a gift. It's okay... There you go. This is my first gift. What? Thanks. A frog. My father and mother are nice, aren't they? Were you surprised yesterday? I'd guess you were. They're not my real parents. So they're kind. They never get mad, they let me do as I will. - The first prince... - ...prince's spirit. Written like your name? Yeah. My father made it. Don't. - What? - No, don't. If you break the branches here, you'll be cursed, they say. Don't. Cursed, huh? It's an expedition. This is fun. That scroll came from here, my father told me. OK, I'll do it. OK, I'll be serious, too. You really want to see it? With my shoes off. Really? Yeah, like on a stage. The thread stretched on and on. Winding it endlessly, Like a spider spinning its web, I made my way through the woods, To a shrine at the foot of the mountain. The thread stopped at the branch of a cedar. What chagrin filled my heart! This was the one had vowed my love. Three turns of the spindle of thread remained. I'd better go. Good-bye. You know, I treasure Hatsuko. What a day! Now I know why I came running here. You hugged me like this, but I couldn't hug you back. Then I remembered. I have been hugged like this before. Really tight. You've been hugged like this too. When you have been, you can do it too. The sky's so blue. I want to see your face. Can I? The Line 1 train will arrive shortly. Stand behind the white line for your safety. Screenplayand Director KAWASE NAOMI I got up and on an impulse decided to visit Jinyoung in Jeonju. I spent too much energy convincing mother I'd be OK driving. I'm already exhausted. I'm nervous driving so far. Jung Yumi / Moon Sungkeun Lee Sunkyun / Kim Jinkyoung It's not big deal. LOSTIN THE MOUNTAINS It's not big deal. Feel better on the highway. I'm not scared. Why didn't you call before you left? I did call you. You called right before you got here. Should I not have come? I'm arguing with my mother. You can't come in now. You should've let me know. Why are you arguing? I spent some of her savings and she found out. She hit the roof. Do you have a cigarette? You know I don't smoke! Oh, that's right. What am I going to do with you? I can't go in, can I? Don't be silly. You came all this way. Can you wait somewhere? Don't worry about it. What are you talking about? I drove here, you know. I know. - You drove all this way - Yes. Wasn't it scary? - It was fun. - Really? Did your brother-in-law give you this? Yeah. Want a ride? It's an old banger but it really goes. Roomy inside too. - Oh yeah? - Get in. Oh, I don't know. I called Mr. Jeon. It's because she made me wait around that I called. I stopped myself many times but ended up calling. It's totally hopeless but I miss him and want drink with him. Hello. Hello, professor. It's Misook. How have you been? Well. And you? You know how it is, the usual. How's your health? Do you still drink a lot? I did, but I have dental problems. I had to get some teeth taken out. I'm not drinking so much now. Is it serious? Not too bad. I feel better now that I'm not drinking so much. I guess I'm getting old. And you? Oh, you know me. I'm in Jeonju. You are? I'm visiting Jinyoung. You know her, right? Of course. It's been a long time. Yeah, it has. It's good to hear your voice. Are you working? Yeah. This is such a bad habit. Want to meet? Do you still write? I'm grateful you care enough to ask. Stop talking like a snob. I don't write any more. You've written everything I want to say. What? To be frank, I really envy you, I do. What's there to envy? I told you, You're a good writer, everyone likes you. Don't pretend you don't know. Me? Pretend? Got everything going for you. Do you still see Myungwoo? He's a bastard. Yeah, he's a bastard. You went out with him, though. That was after I broke up with you. Stop it. I've never met such a bastard as him. You know he copies me, don't you? I know all about it. He copies everything you do. That little shit. That's why he went for you. He knew I was into you. He doesn't know we went out. Remember what you did to me? I was with him because I didn't want to be alone. I used him. It was better than being alone. That's what I'm like. What can I say? Come on in. He kept wanting to do weird stuff. I couldn't take it any more. Misook. Yes? What are you going to write about? Well, I want to write something short. Tell me. Nothing to tell. Go on. I'm interested. I went to Cambodia a while back. Had an idea there. It might be good for a short story. Really? - It's not that interesting. - Tell me. He paid for a substitute driver service. Jinyoung's parents are really nice people. Jinyoung is immature so she doesn't realize how lucky she is. Do you have a nail clipper? On the desk by the pencils. I found Mr. Jeon's watch. A rice wine factory owner gave it to him. - What's the deal with this watch? - What? What's with the watch? Nothing. Didn't know it was there. Whose is it? Your dad's? No. I got it from somewhere. I see.Finish up. We'll talk then. I asked her all morning about her and Mr. Jeon and got all the gory details. So what are you going to do? Don't know. We're so into each other now. We'll have some fun. You don't mind seeing a married guy? It did bother me at first. The first few months, I wanted him to myself. I don't want to force him to get divorced. I'm not like that. You're doing what you feel like. I've always been like that. Why not? You're stronger than I thought. It'd be OK for three to four years. I wouldn't mind at all. It feels good as it is. Right. I hid my feelings and talked to her about it so long. I feel sick now. How can you do that to me? You're evil. Watch your mouth, you shit. You're an evil bastard. How could you do this to me? With her of all people? She's my best friend. How could you? Stop screaming! How dare you? Who the hell do you think you are? How can you be so evil? Don't be so over-the-top! You're blowing this out of proportion! Did she call that a relationship? She's living in a fantasy world. You're all talk! How could you! I have no one to talk to now! I have no one! You're an evil bastard. Don't be so over-the-top! So evil! How you feel isn't important. Facts are important here, facts. What's wrong with you! I called Mr. Jeon. He said he met her for work and ended up sleeping with her. He doesn't want a relationship but she keeps calling. How can you not even say sorry? He said he could never be in love with someone like her. How can he not say sorry? Since no one loves me, I have to rethink my goal. I've always liked her work more than his. I'm going to take look at her house and sit by the gate. - Hi - Hello. I was passing by and I remembered you lived nearby. How did you know where I live? From writers' addresses in a quarterly. They do that sometimes. This is my parents' house. I live in Seoul. Are you a writer? I'm still learning to be one. I see. You're pretty. No, you are. Thank you. You're the most important writer to me. Really? Thank you. What's your name? Misook Jeong. Nice to meet you, Misook. I'm sure I saw you yesterday. I don't think so. You were with Mr. Jeon downtown. Don't worry about it. I have to go in. My mother's waiting. I'm sorry. We had an argument. I have to go in. OK. Hope things go well with your writing. From now, I'm just going to focus on writing. I really am. I'm sure you'll do well. - Thank you. - Bye. I told Myungwoo to come no matter what. I called him on an impulse. I'm so angry at myself. I cried like a fool on the phone. Have you been waiting long? Congratulations for the award. - What? - You got an award, right? Oh, that was a while back. Was it? You okay? I like what you're wearing. Get in. Men are all the same, but I could talk earnestly with Myungwoo about things that matter. It's all over for me. Didn't do anything wrong but it's all over. I've tried not to think about it but I can't help it. Who's going to respect someone who went to motels with her teacher? What's the point of writing? No one knows my work but I'm infamous. Why are you drinking so much? Do I have to have a reason? Were you born for a reason? Do you have sex for a reason? You do it and find a reason afterwards. Dirty little shits. Look who's so clever tonight? Go on and tease me! No one's teasing you. We're on your side. Arrogant bastard. You've let success get to you. You're nothing yet! Okay. I can't see you guys any more. Can't see you any more. We're all here. It'd be great if you could come. Is Misook drunk? She is but she's OK. Why do you all drink so much? You got an award, right? Congratulations. It's nothing. We'll sober up before you get here. We're dying to see you. They said that? Of course. I'm in the middle of something but I'll call you. Please come. I really want to see you. OK, I'll call you. OK. What? You want to kiss me? Go on then. Really? Have you had lots of sex now that you're famous? I've never picked anyone up. I'm a good boy, really. Really? No sex? Well, I have. Only a couple of times. I hate lying bastards. If I call you later can you come? What time? I don't know. Why? Is that a problem? You sound really drunk. It's all over for me thanks to you. I have no hope. Why can't I get drunk? Careful now! You aIways get stupid when you're drunk. Be carefuI my ass! Get off the phone! I'm sleeping with all the men in the world before I die. It feels good to hang up on him for once. I was crazy. I'm not sleeping with him again. Sorry. I want to stay with him. Sorry. Will you be OK alone? Yeah. You driving? We're not going far. Don't worry. Get in. I'll drive. OK. Bye. Hi. They've gone. What are they doing? They're going to sleep together. They were together before. My God! Crazy fuckers. Do you want to come here? It'd be good to see you. Have they really gone? They drove off together. OK. I'll go to Motel District. Shall we meet at The Athens? I'll be there in ten minutes. It'll take me longer. I'll go get a room then. I'll be there soon. OK. Want to get something to eat? You hungry? Want to go tehre? Ok. We left the motel at twelve. He didn't say he wants to start over but the sex was so good. We went to eat something before heading back to Seoul. Let's sit there. OK. What's he doing with her? That's so wrong. I hate the two of them. Is he that desperate? She was his student! I've finished. Let's go. You can't eat with that going on, huh? We can'tjust go without saying hi. If we just leave, he'll say we got it all wrong. Got what wrong? He'll say we misread the situation. He's upset now, hoping we'd come and say hi. I don't care. It's up to you. I feel sorry for her. Stupid girl. They're leaving, the shits. Let's go. I've done nothing to be ashamed of. This feels awkward. It does, right? I've done nothing wrong. She knows about us. He keeps ignoring me, the bastard. You know how petty he can get. How dare he not greet me? The bastard. Look, he's even getting coffee. Shall we wait for them? I'm going. Wait for me. You bastards! Come here, you two! Who? Us? Come here, you fuckers! Hello, Sir? You don't greet your teacher? Think I'm some shitty nobody? I was going to but she was too embarrassed. So you ignore me? You arrogant little shit. Please don't get angry. She was so embarrassed. What stopped you? Sorry, Sir. I didn't want to make you feel uneasy. Uneasy? Why should I feel uneasy? You slept together as men and women do. But we just drank and had a rest. That's it. I heard you left her alone. She called, we had drinks. I knew you'd misread this. I understand her embarrassment, caught like this by me. Don't be angry. Calm down. How could you leave her alone? She wanted to drink some more. Did you feel very bad? No, I just drank with the professor. What a stupid mess! Sorry for shouting. I was so angry when you ignored us. That's not how it should be. We've always got along well. Such a good relationship. This is such a minor thing. That's enough. What? You should be ashamed of yourself! I'm off. Don't come with me. Oh, how rude!
