Please, let me introduce, my wife Anna. Kawecki. - Pretty nice here... - So here we are. - This is here? - Yes. - This is really close. Here I have my meteorological garden. - This is our cottage. - Cottage? This is a real mansion! Luckily it's state owned. Never mind, floors are dirty anyway. Grandpa, this is Janek's colleague, Mr docent. And here is your room. God, it's quiet here! Don't count on any luxuries. Did you drive long? Yes, four hours. Still faster than a train. - How long you can stay with us? - I don't know how long you would like to keep me here. - No, how long is your holiday? - Six weeks from last year. Buddy, you don't even know how happy I am to see you. - More tea? - No, thanks a lot. It seemed to me, that I want to tell you so much, but now, when you arrived, we sit here, and I say nothing. We will talk enough. - It's been long time since you returned? - In September. - Have you been there long? 2 years and 6 months is the States at Harvard. Before that I was in [?] for half a year. But in the States 2 years and 6 months. Then I was in Harvard for few more weeks... across all States - Did you save some money from per diem? - Yes, and I wrote a few books, too. In one year, they will finish TV transmitter and we will have television. - Is this in boss' lab? - No, it's across... Yes, it is probably on the other side. On the way here, I thought all the time about our conversation at... ...what's his name, Strumilo at name day party. What a face! Look at my big ears. You were in his lab, at Zielna street, remember? I saw him after my return. You said then that each of us should have a beacon in someone who would be... ...a scale. It was not about absolute system. We had a fight back then, remember? No, I don't, when was that? That was in '55. No... around St. George's, in April '56. in '56? Maybe, I could possibly think is back then. Sorry I didn't write to you from the States but I didn't write to anyone. You know me with writing. And how did you actually find me here? I was in the institute, immediately after arrival. Lots of gossip about you. Somebody said that you were supposed to be on Kasprovy mountain. - I've met Masza. - Did you see Masza? She is working now with the boss. - She can't regret you enough, buddy. - Did you met him? - Yes, I saw him after return. - Did you spoke about me? We talked about you. When I get back, I'm supposed to tell him what are you doing. Is this anemometer? - What do you have here? - Set of thermometers, thermograph. - Do you often make measurements? - Just for the airlines. - Hair hydrometer. And this is what? - Hydrograf. - There are just hair, right? - Yes, and imagine that human. Of a blond girl. This means that it was minus 18 Celcius at night You could feel it. Wind was so weird. - We don't heat your place enough! - No, it's OK. I have fever. These are ordinary daily measurements, right? Of course, I am not doing scientific research. - Meteorological station. - You must be bored, I'm talking about my work. - Which is not the most interesting. - Oh, no, it's fine. About you we read in newspapers. What do you do? Tell me. They say you work with crystals. At the beginning i dealt with more theory and I had to solve a problem about electrons in a cross-electro-magnetic field. Russians had a theory, which seemed to be reasonable, but there was something frightening. Look here. What do you do when the denominator of magnetic field goes to zero? Buddy, I don't remember this stuff anymore. You must remember it, it's a partial differential equation, 4th grader's level. So, the denominator... For a strong electric and weak magnetic fields there must be a type of electrical solution. And we confirmed all this empirically, and look how it looks like now. Yes, this is interesting. Move over a bit. Well, move... Stand still and I'll give you some hay do you want some? Here. I will find more for you. Their ads are very compelling. - So aggressive. - Did you see this? - Have you looked at a color TV? - Yes, but you know... - How is it like? - I personally prefer black and white. The shapes of cars they have perfected them. Increasingly geometric. Here is Laba. - Is it a powerboat? - A hovercraft. I would advise you: you have 120 children, each will bring one piece of wood, - This will be enough heating for one month. - Are you crazy, what do you say! I'm telling you, you have to collect wood in September, not in January! That's why I came to you, so the Committee would do something, but you can't fix it What do you think, I don't need it for myself! - The mayor is guilty, but they killed a pikey. - Your children also go to school and freeze. You don't care at all! - These are people! - Sign that confirmation of the coal. Thank you very much. That's not how you treat neighbors. Please. Never mind, please. - Anna is local? - Almost, from Terespol. But you can ask her yourself. Listen, I understand that you leave for few months, a year, To catch your breath. - But you live here... - Almost five years. Did you ever think that catching breath may be the right way of life? My friend, but you have to do something. These are our best years. - You will have time to think when you retire. - Are you sure? - What? - That you will live long enough? Don't be silly! I have to think seriously. Sorry... ...to step on your toes... but I don't understand how a man like you can do here. What is filling your life? - Grandpa - strike through... - Write, otherwise we won't figure it out again. Gradndpa - is out, milk is paid Money for loan are secured. I write, the loan 300 And my medication? And my books, remember. Last month I came in short. And I need... - When you get a bonus? - In March, but don't count on it. I would like to tailor the blouse, I need a hoodie... ...with ornament. - OK. - But I could do it - of grandfathers old shirts. - You must be kidding. - Is this a new school? - Yes, we have it here for two years. - Eight grades? - Yes, eight. SCHOOL Millennium Make place children. - This is our guest. - Very nice to meet you. I promised to Mr. docent to show him classrooms and... Absolutely, you can do it yourself. This is a recreation room. Almost all the exhibits were made by ourselves. Do you like it? What's the name of the owl? Please, we didn't have it yet. We use this to explain wave mechanics to children. We bought this recently. It was damaged but, Janek fixed it all. Children, get together. Grazyna, get out! Train... three, four. Train is coming from far away, doesn't wait for anybody, Mr. conductor please take us to Warsaw. This will be very difficult, all around is full of people. Get in quickly let's go to Warsaw. Once again! Train from far away, everybody sing, Mr. conductor please take us to Warsaw. Would you like to drive? - What do you think, Anna? - Yeah. Easy, check everything, When you are ready, just release the brake. Go when you are ready. Don't break on a turn and push the pedal earlier. Push it earlier. You have a talent, man. - Enough, enough. - Why? Really you were good. One says to another: Lend me 100 zlotys. I don't have 100, I only have 50 OK, lend me 50 and you owe me 50. Sorry, I got into conversation. Listen, you are thinking that you are as a "Good Lady" from Orzeszkowa's book such a philanthropist? To some extent I think so. What you actually talk about about with those people? Actually, I never thought about it About everything. About everything except the weather, they know more about weather. You must admit that you don't get optimistic, if so look at those faces. It depends how you look. What is... entropy? But darling, I already explained it, don't you remember? The function of the state. - The physical concept of thermodynamics. - This is the same as atrophy? No, what is the context here? It is: "... the entropy is an increasing process, which occurs in the body." Yes. Here it is used like in humanistic sciences. It has the same meaning as the physical term, in a way. A sort of leveling, termination... This way... Oh, a beach. And there is a lady. Wait, let's look here. Look, a light when you press the button. This is beautiful. Upside down. - You have more? - Quite a lot. Choose the most interesting. This is something. - What is it? - I don't know. Well, I don't have an idea yet. How come you don't know? No, I know I don't have a name for it. - So what's the purpose? - It's useless. When you turn this knob, it will blink, do you see? I wanted it to play, but I don't have some parts. Don't laugh. I like when something blinks. Moreover, I like to solder. No, you are kidding me. - I got it! Denaturator. - Are you crazy? How old are you? In March I will be 36 No, 37. Well, 31st year, 37 years old. So what? Is this a good name? - What? - Denaturator. God alive, man! You have fourth cross on your neck. Three-quarters of life behind you and doing shit. - How can you waste time like that? - Waste what? Skills, talent, yourself. How do you know that I'm wasting myself? This is trivial, but life. It is necessary to decide what to do. One need a goal in life. I look at you at you and I don't understand. - What is actually your goal? - I'm trying to answer myself and it seems to me that it will take the remaining quarter of life or more. My family is long-living. - Hey, who will be the first at the gate? - No, no. If you want, let's have starting line, as it should be. You want internal or external line? - Long distance, right? - Okay. - Who shoots? - You. Ready, steady, go! Two first proceed to finals. Two... Three... - Mature people... - What? Offside. My leg. Don't hit him. Let's start. Draw. Have you noticed the development of the idea of infinity? You know, the Greeks, Aristotle, Plato, for them infinity was somewhat imperfect, slightly worse than the finite. In the Middle Ages it changed. Remember, how was it for Thomas Aquinas? Wait, I will show you. For the modern man idea of infinity is isn't perfect nor imperfect. Ceased to be fascinating subject. I know, we use it daily in mathematics, but due to that it is now only a mathematical concept. It isn't an idea. - Are you thinking about? - No. Brother, I don't even have enough time to read one-third of my subject matter specialization. But during studies we were so excited about philosophy of imaginary numbers. Yes, during studies. No more time. - It's a pity. - We don't have enough time - to learn about everything we find interesting. - Great pitty. We do not live in the Renaissance. This is probably the oldest part. Who is here? - I don't know. - Why? Just like that... "I was, who you are. I am whom you shall be... Remember me so that someone will remember you.'' The atmosphere, like in Chekhov's. Only samovar is missing. All drink tea. Silence, nothing happens. Not at all, in Chekhov's happens a lot. Can you... Thank you. - Do you like Chekhov? - Well yes, it is a little sad. In Paris I saw "Three Sisters" with Marina Vladic. - And you know how Chekhov died? - How? He had tuberculosis, which was incurable at that time. Doctors sent him to Crimea, there was a lot of acquaintances actors from Moscow were visiting him. When he felt that he dies he invited guests. They were staying long at night Chekhov was entertaining them with jokes. He was Laying on a couch, feel very bad. He asked for a glass of champagne, drank draft and then quietly said: "Ich sterbe" and turned to the wall. Janek, stop. He tells this story often? Please understand He is not someone foreign to me. You know that he had an accident? - How long did you lay down? - Six months. Show me. - Now you don't climb mountains anymore? - No, not because of that. Simply - no time. - They say you almost died? - Yes, they say so, why do you ask? - Even the ear, even the nose, even the hand. - Silence, go to bed now! - Even the ear, even the eye, even the leg... - Quiet, Anna, people are sleeping. Calm down. - Even the leg, even the head still, still ... - Anna, enough already. Silence. - Who threw it? - I won't do it anymore, I won't. Will you calm down for good? Traitor! Listen, you know what? What if we would go somewhere on Sunday? Oh yes, wonderful, to Pulawy, huh? No, no, I can't go for the entire day. Listen, maybe you could, exceptionally for the nice visitor, if you would prepare everything and asked grandpa? Yes? Okay. One of the largest in Europe. It produces half of national production. Highly automated. - Sabre, do you see? - It's a scythe. Yes, tools. Come here. Those brooms, great! - And how much for a broom? - What is this? - This is kozuch. We'd like to buy this kozuch. - How much is it? - 10 zloty. - For everything? - Yes, all together. - But why so much? - How many we have? - Wait, grandfather... - Grandmother... Gentlemen and ladies, shoes are cheap. World likes order and butt likes whip. Ladies, gentlemen, they build a large factory in Pulawy, pesticide plant in Poland, learn so people will be wise Adam Mickiewicz, Kochanowski, Copernicus, Maria Konopnicka, Mickiewicz, Sienkiewicz, Kosciuszko... Ropes for a machine, ropes for mini skirts, ropes for underpants... ...every woman will tie something, protect from a vampire... It is perfect. Improvising. Because a good woman is a great treasure for man. - Why are you looking back? - Oh my, just beautiful girls. They are probably sick. That man in the car it's Lomnicki, the artist. Hey, do you think I could have a hat? Maybe, but certainly not to school. - Pity. - What? - That's not yet playing. - Janek! - Did you get it? - Come quickly. The factory provides 2 million tonnes of production, which is almost twice current national production. High standard of the newly opened factory is guaranteed by fully automated production. So, this time again We have something to be proud of. - The news was terrible. - Oh, no, why? How did you like the movie? Did you invite your parents to dinner? No... At least once a week we can be alone. I hate when they show in the cinema those dirty scenes. Finally, I'm a teacher. You were married? Yes, Janek told you? - Did he tell you, or you asked him? - I asked. Why did you ask? Jesus, how stupid I am! - Would you like some tea? - Why did you ask? - It's not important. - For me, yes. I can give first-hand information. - I am not curious. - Really? Really. And why did you divorce? We didn't love each other what's more, I'm not good for a housband. Come on! You are an egoist and egoists always get married. Good that Janek didn't hear that. Why? He is a terrible egotist too but different than you. Why did you get married? I thought that we get along well. You can't think it you must know for sure. Jesus, my lord! Is it visible? Oops! - Don't worry. - Terrible. Sorry, I wanted to cut it nicely. But it's almost not visible. What? You are cheating, not nice. If I don't cheat, it never works. It works only when you cheat. - Is it disturbing? - Radio? No. Do you like to dance? You know this? I will show you. Nothing special, you just have to jump! Pretty nice! You can pour your tea after it boils. You dealt with the structure of boron and then the silicon? Your habilitation was about their practical applications. - Yes, why? - You it in Warsaw first? What do yo have in mind? I got your first interview here for "The World Changes". Non profitable research should be stopped Invent on your own, or buy a license? It was a long time ago. Then you wrote that it's cheaper to buy the technology from abroad. If I remember well... it's about the research, which was done in Poznan. They were the first, you started to do the same after the year. - They didn't have any chance. - But you didn't help them. This is called dirty trick, Am I right? - Yes. - Just yes? Yes. Are you a cynic? No, I am a realist. I had a better chances and I won. Same as at war, pal. If you don't shoot first, they will shoot you. Tag! Tag! Yes, I ordered. Hello, hello, Good morning Professor, Kawecki here. Quiet, quiet, nothing one would like to do. Yes, of course we spoke. We are still talking. No, the issue is not yet clear. I can't talk about it now. I understand, but he... Professor, he has his rationale, he arranged his life, here. No, but I can't force... I'll try everything possible, of course. Yes. No, the weather is beautiful. If something important comes up... If the Russians Leningrad will come. Mrs. Ala will inform me, She knows my number. Thank you, Good bye. Good day. Please. Thank you. Dear friends, first, what you see is a mountain crystal. Looks like ordinary salt. In natural conditions forms huge crystals. These are artificial crystals. Here you can see it bigger, under microscope. Thank you, please trun on the light. And now, as I said before, we strive to produce artificial crystals. We produce, for example, such crystals, like those you have in your radios and TVs, in transistor radios. We also make artificial diamonds. These diamonds are not of course, so good as those which beautiful ladies wear around their necks, but maybe in the future, man-made diamonds will be as beautiful or even better than those found in the ground. So the jewelery will not be artificial anymore but real. Modern man in many cases surpassed in nature. Man-made products are often better than what we find in the ground. Nature starts fall behind. I guess, that's it. Anything else? - Yes we have a couple. - So please. Anna, one moment patience please. Epidiascope does not work... Thank you for your lecture. You're welcome. Oh, thank you. Thank you. It was very good, but don't have much interest in technology. Yes? I 'm not really sure. I think that something will remain in them. - Hello! - What is it? I have a crystal! You know, when I was twelve, This is a period of fantasy, I have imagined I am a pilot, a chimney sweep, or a pirate. I have invented fantastic stories I believed in them truly. I was all this for myself, for real. But I was 12 and you are 36, do you understand? I do not know if you realize that you know only your imagination about yourself, without a chance to verify it. You can live in meadows and think that you are a saint or stoic. Contemplate your cristal soul But without risk, without a fight you will never learn how life look for real. - Listen, why are you telling me all this? - Because I get dizzy when I see someone like you living like pensioner. Cracked bulb. Buddy, listen I'm sorry, I didn't want to hurt your feelings. Never mind You are wrong anyway. I would like to know, how can you know for sure. Stop it, Marek, I don't want to fight again. We won't convince each other. - So now we won't talk at all? - About some things better not. - For me? - From Warsaw, for you. - Hello? Thank you, yes. I'm waiting. - They found you here? - You gotta go? - No, I do not know. - Something important? - Delegation arrived from Leningrad, I should see them. "Should" does not mean you "have to". Well, I thought, it means the same for you. Too bad, the weather is nice. We could go hunting. - Well, maybe next year. - Would you come? If I will only have time off. - This time without a mission? - What mission? What do you think I don't know? You talked with the boss. You promised him, that get me out of here, huh? Well. But you realize, that can get you an apartment, at any time? I know. He wrote to me. So? No? Come back in the summer, for fishing. Translated to English by Pococurante
