Nick, if you get this note, that means that later on, when you get older and you read it, you're gonna understand how much grandpa loves you and misses you. Remember what I told you: It's what you do with what you've got that counts. Always go with your instincts. And never let the next guy get position on you. I know, I should have taken my own advice. I need you to look after Mom and Nanny. Nanny's a little kooky, but she's Alright. You're the man of the house now, and I'm very proud of you. I love you, Nick. And I love you all. Here's your zebbie. Remember what I told you? He's always there for you, just like me. Bye, Nick. I love you. Please, don't fucking do this. Please don't do this. Please don't fucking do this. Don't fucking do this. Don't fucking kill me, please. Please don't do this. Pl-please don't fucking do this. Please. If my blade was sharp, you won't have felt a thing. Pl-please don't fucking do this. My axe is really dull. And you, like him, want to feel everything. Please. Please don't fucking do this. Get rid of the bodies. You never should have done it like this. This is how you put fear in people's minds. Goddammit, I put my money on a seventh of five shot when I knew that seven was the horse. I just should've went with my instincts. Every time I don't go with my instincts, I frickin' lose. Then he decides at the top of the stretch, that he's gonna let the seven horse in front of him. So, he gives him position to beat him. I'm gonna tell you something, Nick. Two things in life, most important thing. First, always go with your instincts. Second, never give the next guy the position to beat you. You understand? OK. Maybe you have better luck. What's your two favorite colors? Pink and green. Alright, pink is the eight, and green is the five. We're gonna play an exactor box with the eight and the five. We're gonna go back in, Alright? OK. - What's an exactor? - What's an exactor? I'll tell you what an exactor is, but you gotta promise me... Alright. When your mother asks where we were today, you tell her that I took you to the carousel in Central Park and we went on the horses. OK? - Can you say carousel, Central Park? - Carousel. - Say, "carousel". - Carousel. Very good. That your favorite pony? Here, let me see. Want me to hold zebbie for you? OK, maybe you have better luck. Let's go play that exactor, OK Nick? Come on. We're stealing five cars a week. We should be moving at least 15. Relax. Right now, Nick wants to keep a low profile. Low profile? Cutting off two cops' heads is a low profile? If the shit storm comes tonight, I swear to Christ, I'm taking Nick out. Relax. You guys! Two G's. When you see Nik, tell him I'm his man. I make things happen. Two G's. They're like nothing. Double it next week and I will. Double it? I'll triple it. I see a real future in you, man. Dude, I'm your man. I'm telling you bro, it's me. It's all me. I got the streets. I got you covered. You just tell me what to do and I'm there. You still here? Just let Nik know who I am. I'm the new guy on the streets. Look for Stevie Bones. You gonna call this guy off, man? Alright, Alright. I'm just fucking with ya'. I got things to do anyway, man. Gotta get that triple. And by the way, we're keeping the money. You gotta pick up Nik. Punctuality is very important. Oh great, that guy is here. What a pleasant surprise. Also, I think it's good for your father. Yeah, but if it's so good for him, why do I feel so bad? I just feel like I just show up every time with the kids, I just dump myself on him. Well, that's sort of exactly what you did. Anyhow... When your mother asks where we were today, you tell her that I took you to the carousel in Central Park and we went on the horses. OK? Wanna go to mommy? Come on. - There's my grandson. - Come on. Go to mommy. You should come by my place. It's about as big as this kitchen. You're always complaining. You got the pension. By the way, I don't see a penny of that pension until you retire or expire. And it looks as if you're breathing to me. Plus I give your mother a thousand dollars a month. And she got the savings account. What you didn't piss away on the ponies. You should thank the ponies. Every time you go piss aqua duckie, you make the sign of the cross. OK? You're such a fucking bitch. Why don't you get a job? Make my life easier. - I am such a bitch. - Why don't you get a job? I gotta get to work. I'll be here in the morning. There you go. Don't worry. I won't be. You know where to find me. Oh sweetie, your dad did tell you that the house is in foreclosure. He did do that, right, yes? Bullshit! You're in denial! By the way, where did you get that accent from? - Coney Island? - Lies, lies, lies. - You sound like an idiot. - Always the same around here. * This guy can think The sky is falling * * I can even hear Your mama calling * * It's written All over your face * * Your attitude's out of place * Stop complaining All the time * * Take it slow And taste the wine * * Turn the grind Get off the ground * * Change the sound And rhyme with something good * * It's no use to run for cover * - Run for cover - It's gonna hit the fan one way or another * * Love is the cash And love is gold * * - Love is gold - I can't believe You had to be sold * * It's no use to run for cover * It's gonna hit the fan one way or another * I'll see you guys later. There's always a reason for being here. You get caught on tape and you gotta, you gotta cut a deal. And everybody's looking to make a deal. - Everybody's looking... - Right now. You know, I hate these-- Hey... Nothing? Hey, your son's doing great in Lacrosse. Thanks. Thanks. Appreciate it. - The gang's here! - How are you, Charlie? Alright. What do you got? - You know why they pulled us in? - I was gonna ask you the same thing. So by the way, Carmine Espacito says hello. You know Carmine? That hairy fuck that owns that pizza place down on 51st? Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Carmine with the brick oven pizzas. - Nice guy. - Oh yeah, he's nice guy, Alright. Had to lock him up the other day. He violated an order of protection on his wife. The sick fuck says he's gonna cut her throat while she's sleeping. Good job, because, uh, he's a man of his word. You know, he says the same thing about you. OK. We got two cops missing. I'm taking you guys off your regular cases to focus on this. You wanna find them, try happy hour. At ease, fellas, at ease. Guys, believe me when I tell you, I wish it was that simple. This is not good. For those of you who don't know, this is Inspector David and Lieutenant Del Veccio from Internal Affairs. In fact, some of you may know these officers in question. Patrolman Bloomberg and Patrolman Daley. I heard this guy's been seeing your wife. Some of you might even know Bloomberg as Dodds or Gary. Yeah, he's been screwing her. Gary's got 30 years in here. I thought you guys were friends. I think he gets an answer. Maybe you can get Carmine to slash her throat. If you're wondering why Internal Affairs are involved, if they're dealing on the street, they get dealt with. So, Lieutenant, if you've been watching them, that means you've been watching this precinct. Oh, you got something to hide? Well, probably should have hidden my wife, but it's a little too late for that. Let's everyone stays focused. These are our boys, I want 'em found. Well, Lieutenant, it seems to me, if you've been watching them, you lost 'em. So, you're worried about the two cops or you're worried about your career? When they find you, you're going to look beautiful. What we did, is gonna bring us some trouble. The streets needed to know, no one steals from us. This is America. It's different. Evan's crazy. Do you understand what he did? Do you understand? You have no more control over this family anymore. - He's crazy. He's the reason we got into-- - Hey! My nephew watched his mother being raped and dismembered while she was still alive. I brought him over here to work with me. He's a good kid. Good morning. Hello. I knew why... Look at this. This is the real stuff, buddy. Be careful with it. It's strong. It's good shit, Mikey, huh? Good shit. - Feel better? - Yeah, it's good. You ready to listen, or you ready to talk? Now Charlie, honestly. I got a horse running tomorrow that will solve all your problems. Serious. Let's see. Your return on investment so far, I think, is negative seven K, here-to-date. Charlie, don't live in the past, Alright. Today's a new beginning. - Tomorrow's a new start. - I'm just saying you got a bad strike rate, brother. Well, things'll change as of tomorrow. They're giving the horse a cocktail. They get a good price on him, huh? It's the maiden race. The horse is over 12. - It's got a cute name. - What's the name of the horse? Teeth of the Dog. - Teeth of the Dog? - Teeth of the Dog. I like that. Teeth of the Dog. You'll be barking all the way to the bank. Alright, buddy? Good source? Trust me, Charlie. I'm not gonna bullshit you. Yeah? I've heard that before. I gotta get this call. Fine. Wanna line before you take the call? No, I don't want a line. Let's not think about it. OK? That'll be great. What do you got, bud? Alright. I'll be right there. Fuck. I have a female on the line stating her boyfriend is feeling homicidal and suicidal. What the hell is this? This was Officer Steve Daley. He's added a 103. It gets better. Open that one up. Pumper? Charlie, Charlie. You alright, Charlie? You alright, Charlie? You alright, Charlie? You alright, Charlie? You alright, Charlie? No, I'm not alright. We gotta get these scumbags. We gotta get 'em quick. Alright? 'Cause we don't know who could be next. It could be one of us in there. I know you're out in the street, I know you find things out before anybody else. As soon as you find somebody out, you gotta come to me right away. You hear me? We gotta work together on this, Charlie. We're gonna keep it close to the list. It's a lousy way to get whacked, Charlie. I hope they died quick. Come on, let's get out of here. Come on, let's go. Charlie, it's unbelievable. It's all over the streets. Two cops got whacked. - They chopped their heads off. - What? - Yeah. - You fucking serious? - Decapitated them? - Hm-mmm. That's fucked up. Did you hear anything? No, not a fucking thing about that. Mikey, I need a lead. Hey, I'll put the word out on the street. But I don't what's gonna get us. That's pretty fucked up. Where you gonna be later? I'll be in Citi Field by the front entrance. I'll meet you there in a half hour, OK? Alright, I'll be there. A 49-year old unidentified man went berserk last night, opening fire with a 12 gauge shotgun in a crowded downtown restaurant. Fourteen people are dead, including three children, four others suffered serious injuries. Police have a suspect in custody, but are not releasing any information until they complete their investigation. A government builder cracked down on laboratory-- Relax, relax, I'm a detective. I'll give you the money for the Funyuns and grape soda. He stole $2,000! Yo? You need a lift? - I'm a cop. - Yeah, no shit. Get in. Give me the money you stole from the deli. - Ho-hold the fuck on-- - Don't fuck with me, man. I got, I got $500. You can have it. You stole $2,000. - Now, come on. - It's yours. It's yours. Alright. Nice and slow, pull it out. OK, here, here. Thata boy. You're a free man. Shut the fuck up. Don't do this. Don't do this. Get off of me. Get off of me. Shut the fuck up, bitch. Police. You let her go, OK? I swear to God, I'll fuckin' cut this bitch. Just be cool and let her go, OK? Fuck. Fuck. Who the fuck is this guy? I've done a lot of fucked up things. But you don't rape anybody.. Why don't have them rape each other? What do you think? I'm gonna flip a coin. It is shit. Is he fucking joking? Are you joking? I'm serious. Now, you got two choices. You go to jail or you rape each other and you apologize to the lady and I'll let you go, OK? Heads. Fuck you, pig. Fuck that bitch too. Fuck you. You see them boasting like that? OK, let me ask you something? Are you high? I'm good. I'm not asking you as your friend. I'm asking you as your union delegate. You killed those two fucking guys inside. We both know. You're gonna get a piss test on this one. And I know you're gonna fail it. It's too late for me, John. What are you talking about, "late"? Just see what you can do. I gotta get outta here. Hey, hey, hey. Don't walk away from me. I'm not losing my job on this one. This is how it's gonna play out. I'm gonna go back inside and tell the bosses that you drove to the hospital yourself. I don't care what hospital, gonna take them all night to try to figure that out. All I know is, tomorrow morning, you'd better be calling me. And you better make sure you call me from the pharm. Now, you be good. Huh? Charlie. Charlie, you can't-- I gave you $12,000. It was four months left. Where's the money? I took a loan. What am I? Chase Manhattan Bank? - I have expenses-- - Sean, listen to me! I need the fucking money, OK? Why do I put up with this bullshit? Look at that. Like a fucking hornet's nest. How the hell is it, that a known gangster from one country has turned into a gangster informer in ours. It's fucking beyond me. Listen, we made a lot of collars because of this guy. Shut up. We lost 'em. They're gonna give a hell of a shock to us. That's what we got because of this guy. What the fuck? What do you think? Do you think the commissioner gets ahead on us? What do you think? Shit, I must have misplaced my wallet. You want money? I just want to go upstairs with a heavier pocket. I saw what you took from those cops that were killed. Don't worry about me ratting on you. We are the new kings of this city. I won't let them hurt your pretty little face. Now, hand it over. Ah, good man. Don't worry, I won't lose your money. You trust me, yes? I will tell you this is not about me. I know, we know. You don't know the sacrifices I've made for all of us. Now, we will run the streets our way. Hey, what have you got, a pack? Alright. I'll be right there. He's clear for warrants. He's got nine pages in RMS for serious assaults. Looks like a suicide attempt. There is talk on the streets about what we did. They are calling us animals. As long as you did your job, we are safe. We delivered the coolers as ordered. Then sit back, relax, play some poker and drink. Hey Mac, how you holding up? Not so good, Charlie. I gotta go break the news to Daley's wife now and, uh, Bloomberg's parents. I don't care how many years we're at this game, it never gets any easier knocking at that fucking door, man. I know. First time I had a knock on a door, I had to tell parents that their ten-year old boy got killed trying to run over the railroad tracks. I was the one that picked the kid up off the tracks. When the ambulance got there, first thing I did was call my wife and told her to kiss my kid. It mindfucked me. Well, you know, you, you don't make it through that shit. Now I'm numb to this insanity. But I have to admit, seeing those heads really spooked me, man. These some violent motherfuckers. They're not like mafia. If they have to, they'll kill kids. Why are you still on the job? Do you still need to do this? Charlie, like you, I ain't got a fuckin' pot to piss in, man. You know, when the sun comes up and the stuff hits the newspapers, the city's gonna go nuts when they hear that two cops got whacked and their heads fuckin' chopped off. I'd go for the Mayor's office now. They're gonna want answers. You know, you're always ahead of everyone else. You know, I don't know how you do it, but you do it. You're a goddamn good detective, Charlie. So are you. Listen, anything you hear, any information you got, you gotta let me know right away. Alright? I don't want you to go solo on this. Alright. I'll call you. Now get some rest, OK? Don't forget to call me, Charlie. - I will. - Just call me. I'll call you, you crazy fuck, you. Get some fuckin' rest, OK? - Yeah. - Right. What can you give me on the hit? Some crazy fuckin' guys. That's the word. They're just a bunch of crazy fuckers. If I were you, uh, I'd let somebody else take care of this. Ah, you're really worried about me. Why shouldn't I? You're one of my best friends. Uh, you're always there for me. You helped me put my kids through college. I mean, you're special to me, Charles. They kill cops. I don't care how dirty a cop is, you don't kill a cop. Well, I never told you this. You know, uhm, they fuckin', they grabbed me one night, threw me a beatin' and they took my territory and they told me not to fuckin' tell anybody. I tried to fight back and then one guy held me and the other guy cut my fuckin' toe off. - When did this happen? - Well, first of all, the kid that cut me, he was like fuckin' Satan. He's just a sick fuck. What? Are you fuckin' kiddin' me? It was just to show me they were serious. Two of his friends held me down, he pulled out a knife and he just cut my toe off. He laughed and then he pushed me, he said, "Go to the hospital, you fuck." Mike, I want you to tell me where I can find them. Come on, Mike! Just fuckin' tell me, man. They're at the, uhm, the diner on Emmons Ave. The Mediterranean diner. Like clockwork, they're there every fuckin' night between 11:30 and one. They hold court back there with those fuckin' bimbos and... Oh, you'll know 'em the minute you walk in, 'cause they'll look at you, for sure. That's an automatic. You'll get their attention. I'm hungry. You wanna get something to eat? - Nah, it's alright. I'll pass. - Alright. - You take care, Mike. - You be safe. Hey, buddy, how you doing? Listen, I'm looking for two guys. Think they're in the back. - Those two guys there? - That's right. - Thanks. Hey, nice watch. - Thank you. Good to see you. What do you know about the two cops that got whacked tonight? What is your name? Detective Charlie Mantle. You motherfuckers make the mafia look good. So, tell me something. You gotta know something, right? In front of me, talk English. We don't speak or understand English very good. Really? I'm gonna pull my cock up your sister's ass. What did you say? You see, you do understand English. What do you want from us? We know nothing. Is it day or night? - Excuse me? - I said, is it day or night? I-i-it is night. See, you do know something. You ever see that movie No Mercy with Richard Gere and Kim Basinger? I love that fucking movie. That's a line from that movie. Is it day or night? Ever see that movie? Me and my friend are law-abiding citizens. We mind our own business. We don't know shit. What do you do for a living? Hmm? Import, export. What do you import, export? Sugar. Yeah. Sugar? Detective Mantle, I am a peace-loving man. I don't even eat food if it comes from an animal. Look, salad. I am a vegetarian. Mmm. Can I, uh... see your salad? Try the salad dressing. You'll love it. - You piece of shit. - Eat that! Motherfucker. Hey Twinkle toes. Put another 2,000 on Teeth of the Dog. What do you mean you won't take the bet? I've got the cash. Call up Little Richie and book. He knows I'm good for it. Just do it. He's clear for warrants. He's got nine pages... So, they bring over the cooler, they open it up, Bloomberg's staring right at me. They eyes are wide open. That's fucked up. I was a rookie with Bloomberg's father. He was there to help me pick up the pieces of that ten-year old boy from the railroad tracks. Charlie, listen, that was 20 years ago. You can't keep beating yourself over the head over that one. You know that? That wasn't your fault. Got my vices, a general gambler, the women, the high... Why? Why? So, what was it? I mean, what was Bloomberg into? Bloomberg lived with his parents. So, what do you got? You got anything? I know they were Russians. Well, shit, Charlie. This is the fuckin' Russians. You gotta put an end to this. 'Cause they'll go after your fuckin' family, you know that. They'll kill everybody. They're fuckin' crazy. Listen, Charlie, I'm ready to get back in the game. I've got my guns. I'll kick their fuckin' asses with you. I'll see you, Bobby. Be safe. Yeah. Where's my tip? 'Cause they'll go after your fuckin' family... They'll kill everybody. Get out of the car. I said, get out of the car. Now I got I.A. following me. Do me a favor and crawl out of my ass. You know, you look like shit, and you smell like it. Dirty cops investigating dirty cops. How do you do that? How do you do that? I place a few bets. That's all I do. OK, asshole? Nah, it's more than placing a few bets. You're a fuckin' lowlife. I never fucked my friends' wife. I'm not your friend. I never was. Jesus Christ! You think I give a shit? I'm following you for over a year now. Your indictment's coming. I pull you off the street this morning. You'll be in prison by the end of the year. Am I imagining this shit? This is an inspector and a lieutenant. We're doing surveillance on you. You got a smoke? Were you ever a good cop? What happened to you? What are you? My priest? Look, my head's getting ready to explode. Why don't you stop breaking my balls? I'm breaking your balls? Hey, there's civilian complaints on you, pal, they got you as a fuckin' deviant. You know, for a $20 co-pay, Charlie, you get help. You shouldn't have passed the psychological to get this fuckin' job. You know, you're a guy with nothing to lose here. We need you tonight. Can you help us with this? Can you? Stay a cop. What do you got to lose? Well, you have four more hours, right? What do you really know about Bloomberg and Daley? They started on a job of Bloomberg's father. So, you're investigating a cop who's investigating a cop. - That's bullshit, man. - No. What's bullshit, is shaking down Russian drug dealers, when the orders came from the top to have the cops deal with it. Now what are you gonna do about it? Start at the bottom. Work my way to the top. American dream. And by the way, Lieutenant, you're the bottom. Good. You got four hours. Remind me never to introduce you to my wife. - Fuckin' Mikey. - Oh, Jesus, you scared the shit out of me, Stevie. You a fuckin' rat, man? What's the matter with you? Look at you. What, are you off your meds? What are you laughing at? What the fuck are you doing? I see you fuckin' with cops, Mikey. - I talk to everybody. - I fuckin' watched you, motherfucker, - talking to that fuckin' pig. - I'm Nickey's biggest earner. How do you think I got what I got? Get out of my face, first of all. - I'll fuckin' shut-- Get the fuck out of my face. Stay the fuck away from me. Alright? You're nothing to me. You little fuckin' punk. Stop it. You're being stupid. Oh, you're gonna shoot me? You don't have the authority to shoot me. You're fuckin' dead, man. - I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm... - I don't need no fuckin' permission. I'm Nickey's biggest earner. Get outta of my face. I will crack you the fuck-- You're fuckin' dead, motherfucker. I wanna take you out. You fuckin' understand? - You understand? - Take me out, yeah, take me out! Put the fuckin' gun away. It's, it's gonna be a nightmare for you. Shots fired in Citi Field. Please respond. - Shots fired at Citi Field. - Fuck. Alright, Charlie. Over here. - Oh God, it hurts. - Who did this to you? Oh, some fuck. Talk to me, Mikey. Who did this? This fuckin' kid. This little fuckin' meth head. Oh, this motherfucker. He wants my territory. Fuckin' he didn't even have the permission from Nik to do this. Who's Nick? Nik's the guy, I never met him, but he's the guy that everybody pays up to. And he's the guy that have the cops killed. Why didn't you tell me this? I didn't wanna get you involved with these people. They're too many to go through t-t-too get in. Just fuckin' move on. Go home. It's all over for me. - Take it easy. - Oh God, it's cold. Where can I find him? Sammy. Sammy at the Blue Lizard Lounge. He'll put you in the right direction. Just tell him... Oh God. Tell him that you're a player and you wanna get involved in the business and he'll set you straight. He got all the answers.

Don't you know who I am? I'm Nickey's biggest fuckin' earner, bro'. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, you must be talking about that rat, Mikey, huh? Rat Mikey? Was that his name? Hey, hey, look. I'm just trying to be an asset here. And you are. Heaven needs his practice. Did you tell him about the $2,000 I gave you guys this morning? What's he talking about? He's a junkie. Nothing. A junkie. You know, you're a guy with nothing to lose here. We need you tonight. Can you help us with this? Can you? Stay a cop. You know, you're always ahead of everyone else. You know, I don't know how you do it, but you do it. You're a goddamn good detective, Charlie. Anything you hear, any information you got, you gotta let me know right away. I gotta see Nik about that money I owe him. Don't worry about Nick. You work for me now. You owe me the money. You're running out of time. What do you mean I'm running out of time? You gotta give me some slack here, you know. You got rid of my two biggest earners. You know, I got a lot of things in the works. You know, I got something big going down tomorrow night. - I'm gonna make a lot of money-- - Hey! You got problems, I got problems. We all got problems. You owe me money. Time's running out. And you have a beautiful daughter. - What can I do for you? - Sammy sent me over. Why, thank you. There is no turning back. No turning back. They will suffer and more blood will spill. We will cut the hearts out of their first born if we have to. We'll start with their bastard Mayor. Five K. It's good. Aren't you gonna count it? He'll know if it's short. - Hey, Mac. - Hey, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? I'm on the job doing my job. Aren't you in A.A.? Yeah, I'm on vacation. - What a fuckin' night, Charlie. - Yeah. Did you Daley's wife and Bloomberg's parents yet? Nah. I couldn't do it. They'll get told today. Did you know Daley and Bloomberg? - I play softball with them - Ah! And a couple of guys here who wanna train, but that's about it. Who are you bullshitting? You're an old guy like me. You don't play ball, you play chess. Are you Catholic, Charlie? Am I Catholic? Weddings and funerals, I ain't gonna bullshit myself. There's a condo in hell waiting for me. Charlie... Is a sin of omission the same as or as bad as the sin of commission? I mean, I know if you commit a crime, it's a sin, but is it... is it a sin if you don't commit the crime, but know who did the crime and... tell nobody? I saw you at the White Burger about a half hour ago. Everybody knew you. I did a coke buy. That would be really fucked up if we passed each other as I was walking out. I know why you wanted me to tell you everything, Mac. You were the middleman for Daley and Bloomberg. They give you the money, you bought the coke, they moved it on the street. And Daley and Bloomberg, they got greedy. They wanna cut out the middleman and the supplier. So, they start shaking down drug dealers. Russians. That's fucked up, Mac. - It's fucked up. - I know it's fucked up, Charlie. I know it's fucked up. You're a good fuckin' detective, Charlie. What am I gonna fuckin' do now? Huh? What am I gonna do? You're my friend. And when my friend's in trouble, I wanna help. Tell me the motherfuckers that killed Daley and Bloomberg are in that building. I don't know who these fuckin' butchers are, but they're all in there, Charlie. If I'm gonna go vigilante on these scumbags, I gotta do it before the sun comes up. What are you talking about? We call in SWAT, they're all gonna be taken in alive. That means, Russian, no Russian, they're gonna rat each other out. And it's gonna be over for you. Twenty-two, twenty-three. How many years you've been on the job? Too long. And all you're gonna be known for is being a dirty cop. Hey, none of them deserve to live. I know. Now, you listen to me, and you listen good. If I don't come out of that building, that means I'm dead. Now, if I do come out, you gotta identify yourself and call in a 10-13. Then you meet me in front of the building, OK? Can you do it? Yeah, I can do it. You got faith in me? You're my friend, Charlie. That's right. I'm your friend. And tonight, your faith is gonna be rewarded. Charlie Mantle. I thought you'd forgot. Or finally moved on. I-it's not much, I wish it was more. You don't look so good. Every year we get older. My baby stays frozen in time. You don't have to do this every year. You need to let it go. I told you to stop. - You killed me, Charlie. - I told you to stop. You killed me. - Why did you do it? - I told you. I yelled at you. - All I had was a baseball card and gum. - I told you to stop. - Why did you make me - I yelled at you - run into that train? - "The train is coming". Charlie, stop! We both know how it ends. It's not gonna change. You need to let it go. It's time to move on. OK, honey. I'll see ya. Let it go, Charlie. Father John never fixed that broken window at the back of the rectory. Hey, maybe that's his way of saying to me I might still have a chance of getting into heaven. Through a broken window. Who knows, but that sounds like me. Forgive me, God, I'm a little banged up. I appreciate everything you've done for me. I asked you to bring my family back and you did. Not the way I would have liked, but hey, what the fuck. You know what I'm about to do. God, I don't wanna die. But I'm at peace with whatever you have in store for me. I left a few bucks at the candles of St. Anne for mom and dad. I guess that's what I'm best at. Paying down my guilt. Forgive me, Lord. Throw me a line. I promise I won't hang myself with it. I know the rules. Guys, let's do toast, huh? - Ja. - Let's do drink like we do in Russia, OK? Some vodka. Albanian guys, join in with us too. Come on. ...which means for your health, eh? They want to see you out front. You wanted me? Go check out the perimeter and report back to me in ten minutes. Nick, if you get this note, that means that later on, when you get older and you read it, you're gonna understand how much grandpa loves you and misses you. Remember what I told you: It's what you do with what you've got that counts. Always go with your instincts. And never let the next guy get position on you. I know, I should have taken my own advice. I need you to look after Mom and Nanny. Nanny's a little cooky, but she's alright. You're the man of the house now and I'm very proud of you. I love you, Nick. And I love you all. Here's your zebbie. Remember what I told you? He's always there for you, just like me. Bye, Nick. I love you. Don't die yet. Even is only doing what was done to his loved ones. I support him. Some psycho motherfucker. Say hello to Satan for me. Don't you fuckin' talk to me that way. You're the reason we got into this fuckin' mess. OK? No. No. You never called in the 10-13, Mac. What are you talking about, Charlie? I called it in. You asked me if the sin of omission is the same as the sin of commission? What are you talking about, Charlie? You have one more chance. Charlie, I'm not God. Be a hero cop. Get in. Get in! Come on! I'm here in Astoria, in the 103rd precinct where a ferocious gun battle has taken place between New York City police detectives and a notorious, ruthless Russian mob, leaving one detective mortally wounded and some members of the Russian mob dead. Detective Burns, is there anything you can tell us? Well, I can confirm that there was a death of a, a New York City police detective. Uh, I can't release his name yet until his family's notified. But I will say that he did die a hero. And that his family will be taken care of by the New York City Police Department family. I gotta go now. Thank you, detective.

Easy, easy. Here, look. Look. Look. Look. Here. Here's a rope. Don't hang yourself with it. Teeth of the Dog. Third race at Belmont tomorrow. It's a sure thing. Now, let me walk out of here and we'll forget everything. Walk out of here? I'm sorry, Charlie. I can't do that. It's out of my hands. What about the act of contrition, hmm? Hmm? I'm sorry, Charlie. Then get it over with. Get it over, Mac. Come on. Come on! Have him shoot me! Come on! Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm sorry, Charlie. I'm an atheist. What a dumbbell. Half his career. He knew what was waiting for him here. But the family would have gotten nothing if he was convicted. Yeah. No insurance company in the world, hey. They don't pay you to kill yourself. You gotta die on the job. Right? Then you're the fuckin' hero. What time you got? Eleven thirty-five. - Where the fuck is this guy? - He's coming. He's fuckin' late. He's coming. No, he's coming. Look who decided to show up. There you go. Now I'm out from under. Are you gonna count it? He'll know if you're short. Listen, don't get tough with me, kid. We're fuckin' even now. What the fuck is this? I'm putting fear in your mind. Fear in your mind. Here's your fuckin' fear. Yeah, fuck you, fear.
