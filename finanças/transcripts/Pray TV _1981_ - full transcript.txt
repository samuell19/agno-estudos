[CLEARS THROAT] As you all know, we've had a little cash-flow problem lately. Yeah, I haven't been paid in weeks. But we've always thought that things would work out, right? We have been a family for quite a while. But now we are in deep shit. The rent's a month overdue. The FCC licensing fee was due last week. Well, in other words, at most we've got a month. A month, that is, providing we do something about it. So, in order to help, I have asked a dear old friend of mine, Mr. Marvin Fleece. Thank you. Please, we're a little pressed for time now. Well, friends, and I'm sure we'll all become friends ultimately, as bleak a picture as Millie here paints, God love her, I just wanted to assure you all that it's much worse than that. But I don't want you to get depressed about it because I believe there's a solution here. See, I've always believed that for every drop of rain that falls, a little tree with grow. And I can see a magnificent tree growing out of the brambles of this station. How? By giving the people what they want. What they need. By giving the people what their hearts and their minds are crying out for. And that's one simple little thing. It's salvation. [MOUTHING] And when you think about salvation, don't you think about religion? Don't you think about the Lord? Don't you think about God Almighty? Well, that's what the people of San Poquito think about. And California. And the people all across the country, that's what they think about. That's what they think about, and that's what they want. And that's what we're going to give 'em. We are going to create brand new television programs, and we are going to attract new viewers, and praise God, new sponsors. We're gonna let those other television stations give away all the cars they want to. All the cars and them crummy little Jap TV sets. But they will never, never compete with us. Because we are giving away the word of God. Every one of you here is going to become a messenger of the Lord, and spread his word throughout this great land. Now, go get 'em! Go, shorty. There we go.

And the Lord sayeth unto his disciples, "Giveth your first born unto the Lord "and be plentiful and multiply." But they couldn't multiply 'cause they couldn't do simple addition yet. So, they begot. They begot whenever they could. And then to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth, even under him were children born. And Eber begot Sheleph, and Sheleph begot Obal, and Obal begot Sheba and Jobab. And Jobab begot Samuel, and Samuel begot Claude. And Claude begot Bebe. And Bebe begot and forgot to begot.

[SNARLING] Well, Fred, the situation here at the Olefson home hasn't seemed to change too noticeably. It's been an exciting few moments for me, however. [LAUGHING EVILLY] As of this reporting, the devil has refused to leave. Stating that possession is nine-tenths of the law. I attempted to interview the boy's mother, Mrs. Ernie Olefson. And she said the boy was probably just trying to get attention. [GIBBERISH] Now, this is Henry Flood at the home of possessed boy, Bernie... Olefson, you nitwit! Olefson. Now back to you, Fred. Thank you, Henry. Stay on that story. And in sports, the Beth Olam Hassids creamed the Twelfth Street Krishna Tambourines in a grindingly fought battle.

Okay. Boy, things are really shaping up. Hey, what's the deal, Fletch? Where the hell's my bed? What do you mean? Well, somebody took all my stuff from up in the catwalk. Well, it's probably some new safety rule or something. Oh, some safety rule?Yeah. Hey, Fletcher, what's the deal on overtime? Huh?Well, here's my paycheck for last week. Forty regular hours? I worked my ass off last week. Oh, my God.FLETCHER: Yeah, I know you did. Well, I'll ask Marvin about it. I know he's trying to keep expenses down. I'll check into it. Oh, yeah, sure, sure. Why don't you just forget it, huh, Fletch? Yeah, you know, it's not the same old Fletcher. You know what I mean? Wait a minute, you guys. What are you talking about? No, you put that in my personal account. Right. Now, I'll take care of the KGOD deposits myself. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Who's there? Fletcher. Yeah, come on in. Listen... Yeah, all right. Well, listen, I... I better run. Yeah, but do me a favor though, will you? Will you call me on my private line as soon as you talk to Switzerland? All right? Right. [LAUGHS] Yeah, right. Nice talking to you, too. Okay. Praise God. How you doing, Fletch? What can I do for you? Well, Dwayne is complaining because he hasn't been paid any overtime. And Elmer is real unhappy because all of his stuff has been moved out of the catwalks. And... Now, wait a minute, wait a minute, Fletcher. You know, the only, to me anyway, the only real happiness in the world is, is doing God's work. Well, now, just think about Job. When things weren't going real good for him, what did he do? Did he start complaining about overtime, or somebody moving his furniture around or something? Of course not! We're talking about a man with leeches on him all over, head to toe. Well, yeah it's, it's not quite the same thing. I mean, like...No, no, I understand things are very tough now and everything, but we're growing. Well, the next thing we're going to do is put up a satellite. Satellite?KGOD satellite. We're going to spread the word of God all over the world. Wow!All I ask of you, is a little patience. You and the crew. Just a little patience, that's all I ask of you. [SIGHS] I'm sorry.Look, we all make jerks of ourselves every now and then, okay? Oh, forget about it. Go on. Well, wait, there's one other thing. A lot of people have been wondering where all the money is going. The money? Well, see, once again, you don't have to worry about the money, Fletcher. If you just understand the underlying principles of capital formation and kamikaze accounting. You see, it's just like... Well, take General Motors, for instance, you know. What do you think they do with all the money they make? Go out and spend it? No, they take the money and they put it right back in the corporation. That's all we're doing here, is just reinvesting in KGOD. Okay? And I'll tell you something else, Fletcher. Next weekend, you and me are going fishing. Fishing?Fishing. Oh, that's great. ANNOUNCER 1: Bad karma. Bad karma. Bad karma. When yin and yang are separated, you suffer from loss of essence and bad vibes. But Karma Septic settles the karma center into perfect tranquility.

You know, ever since I got here, I've been kinda keeping an eye out for you and everything, and I just... I just wanted to tell you how much I appreciate the fact that you seem to give about 110% on everything you get involved in. I think that's great. To tell you the truth, it kind of reminds me of myself, and I love that. But what I really wanted to say to you, Peggy, is that I guess from the time I first laid eyes on you, Peggy, I felt very, very close to you. You know, in a fatherly kind of way, and I was just thinking, or hoping, anyway, that you might do something for me. Would you... Would you take this? It's just a little money, and you don't have to tell anybody about anything, but would you take it and buy something you wouldn't ordinarily buy? You know, something very frivolous and indulgent. You know what I mean? Yeah, I know what you mean.Great. You mean you'd like to use me the way you use everything and everybody else at this station. Excuse me? Like you're turning God into a product and religion into a three-ring circus. What are you doing, Peggy?I'm being frivolous. That's money. That's American money. [CHUCKLES] I'm indulging myself. Besides, what do you care, Marvin? This is not your money, this is God's money. Peggy, God's not going to like this, I promise you. Well, then why don't you go to the bank and get him a loan? Peggy, look, you could have had anything you wanted. You could've had furs, jewels, candy, a little diesel Volkswagen. Do you think that matters to me?Whatever you wanted. Yeah, I do think it matters to you. Well, then you've forgotten John 10:9. "Woe to you whom lay treasure upon treasure. "Yea, verily shall ye be like unto swine." How about Matthew 5:51? "For to everyone who has, shall more be given." Peloponnesians 16:8. "A rich man cannot go through the eye of a needle." Euclidides. Euclidides 6:6. "Waste not, want not." Huh?

Last night, ladies and gentlemen, I had a vision. Last night, as I was kneeling down next to my cot saying my prayers... ...a light came from the heavens, and a voice emanated from that light. Stop that. Friends, that voice happened to be the voice of God. [ALL GASPING] What he was saying to me was that... You're a crook.Shh! ...even as hard as I've been working all these months at KGOD, it has not been good enough to implement his plan. It's the Fleece Plan. He's fleecing everybody. As a result of that revelation, I have come to a very personal, very difficult decision. I have decided to give Station KGOD, I'm talking about the programs, the name, the concept, the whole ball of wax, I'm going to give KGOD to the Unified Broadcasting Company. What?He's lying!
