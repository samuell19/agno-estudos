Shaw brothers Ltd. Shaw studios production Your highness! Master! Hey, come back in, hurry up, come in! Thank you very much for your custom, sir, I hope to see you soon. Get back in, the clients are impatient, hurry up! - We have been waiting for ages... - I am so sorry... What do you mean by this? We're leaving. - Why are the two ladies not here yet? - They're coming... Ice, crimson, come here, hurry! Excuse us. - Hurry up! - What's the urgency? - Master ho demands to see you. - All right! - Master ho! - What took you so long? - Huh? Have been tardy, many apologies. Please don't get angry, sir! They are here now, please forgive them. Come, sit down. Let's drink up. Cheers! - Master ho, to your health. - I am so very sorry. We shouldn't have been late, we are willing to take any punishment. Please don't be angry with us, eat something, let's drink. It'd be fine if it was up to me, but my brothers are very unhappy. - Sir, I am so sorry... - Sir, please forgive me... Come on, let's drink up. Strong trunk, small, dense, lush green leaves. Nice, very nice. This bottle gourd has orchids painted throughout, wonderful. This vase dates back to the ming dynasty. It is exquisite. Where are crimson and ice? - Madam! - I'm here. - What can I do for you? - Where is crimson? I am sorry, let me call them back. How can they run around when we are appreciating fine art? - It is such a kill-joy, don't you say so? - Of course! - Madam! - Yes? I have already booked the package... Bullshit! You are saying I cannot afford it? No, but master wang has... Has paid in full... So you mean I cannot afford to do the same? I don't mean that... - Don't you? - No... - Of course you do! - No, I don't mean that. You humiliate us! You don't think we're wealthy enough? - What's the commotion? - Sir, don't mind them, let's enjoy the wine. Just lift the gold ingot, drink all the wine in the cup, and the gold bar belongs to you. Then you are free to go. Why not? Well done! It's good stuff! Thank you! - Two more cups. Who wants a drink? - I want one! - I want to drink! - Me too! - I'll drink. - Let me drink it! - Why aren't they here yet? - Master wang... Many apologies, but master ho is giving away gold bars. - Real gold bars? Let's go get some. - Yes! Not so fast. Why would that man give away gold bars? Crimson and ice got gold bars just for drinking a cup. Each bar weighs five taels! - Master wang, we would like... - Be patient, sit down first. His gold bars weigh only five taels each. These bills of credit, do you know how much each bill is worth? We can't even see the writing, how would we know? - Let me have a look. - Hey... Let me tell you the answer. The smallest one is worth 10 taels. Some are worth 15 to 30 taels. - One of them is worth 50 taels. - Wow! See if you are lucky enough to get one. Not so fast. With a game like this, the more participants, the merrier. Of course, I know what you mean. Come on, I want to drink, too. Well done, well done! Crimson, ice, come with me. Master wang is holding a lucky dip in the other room, - you will get bills of credit! - We like gold bars. Silly girls, those bills are worth 10 taels and more. The highest could be 50 taels! - Is that true? Wow! - Of course. Come on, girls, to the other suite. Large bills are in a lucky dip, quick. Come on in, hurry up! Steady... go! Twenty taels! Mine is 15. Wow, 25 taels! What? Only 10 taels. How about yours? - Thirty taels! - The same as mine! - Twenty-five here. - I've got 30 taels. What do you get? Ten taels. You shouldn't be so upset. Those wretched girls are so materialistic. The 50-taels bill is still unclaimed, go on! Wait! Lucky clip, is it? The largest of these bills is just a meagre amount of 50 taels. Let me tell you, this single strand of pearls... - Is worth 100 taels. - Wow! I also have Jade, agate, coral, precious gems that are much more valuable. - I suppose you fancy these? - Yes, we want them. Then follow me. Stay here! You want precious jewels? I have these, too. Wow, so beautiful! Agate, Jade... Move away! So are you in the same trade? Indeed, I do this trade as well. May I ask, where have you established your trade? I am from Beijing, and this is my first experience in canton. The way you poach clients, is that a northern practice? As long as I offer genuine jewels at a good price, there should be no rules. You don't respect the regional boundaries or any rules. I want to see what gives you such confidence. What's that for? Is beating people up a southern practice? How do you run a business without clout? Argh, my foot! - We northerners do business sitting down. - You sat on my foot! Stop fighting, please! Stop this. Move along! - Stop it, please! - Surround this whole place! Come on! Why are you fighting? What's the matter, sir? We are informed that there are two treasure chests here. One of them was stolen from the minister's residence. Who owns the bigger chest? It is mine. What about the small one? Whose is it? - Is it yours? - No, no, it isn't. - Speak! - It is not mine. If no one owns up, we'll arrest everyone! Both belong to me. Are both chests really all yours? - Indeed. - What...? You're drunk, Mr. Ho. I am a jeweler, and these jewels are my merchandise, brought from Beijing. I don't care how high and mighty you are, come with us! Wait! I have documents as proof. This is my proof. Provincial commander-in-chief Why do you look down there? I haven't hidden any gems in my shoes. Sir! My name is wang, a bona fide jeweler. No need to search here, let's move on! - Such a powerful jeweler, eh? - Hold on. Yes, sir? My friend here is very intoxicated. He is carrying a lot of valuable items. It is not safe for him to travel alone. - Would you kindly take him home? - Yes, sir. No, there is no need, I am sober. - This chest is mine. - My friend, you certainly are drunk. I shall put these in safekeeping. - Take him home. - Come on. I am not drunk, I don't need escorting... He doesn't look drunk... You are so wonderful. Damn you! You think you can trick me just because you have connections? Don't let me see you again! - Hey, I am sober now. - Sober? Don't you know? A cool breeze makes you wide awake. Really? Can it work so quickly? I wouldn't lie to you. My home is just there, over the bridge. Are you steady enough? Let me show you how steadily I can walk. See? I am steady. Officers, you are free to go now. What are you staring at? Get lost! Let's go! Watch your step. Didn't I tell you not to drink so much? That Beijing rascal. Think you can scam me because you're connected with the police? Not on my own turf in canton! Come on, drink and be merry. Lovely wine! This wine is aromatic. Mr. Lee, I've travelled all the land below the yangtze. I have tasted all the wines there are, but this is the very first time I have tasted vintage wine from canton. Absolutely! It's the first time I've been scammed, too! Oh... it's you, Mr. Ho, my dear friend! Why are you dressed like that? In our profession, we often need to adapt our costume. Shouldn't you have learned this already? Mr. Lee, this friend of mine used to be a jeweler like me. But now... he works as a fisherman. How dare you, you Beijing rascal! Argh! Mr. Ho, it's been ages since we met, why don't you sit down? Please sit. Since you are old friends, we must all have a good chat over wine. Please sit down. - Serve the wine, please. - Hey! Shouldn't you return the chest that you're keeping for me? This is not the time to talk shop. Let's chat about something else. - That's right, let's drink first. - Wait. - You can leave the bottle. - Certainly. Now the wine is drunk, go get my stuff. Patience, you will get it. Why the hurry? Holy vairocana's palm cheers! Have your palm read to establish yourself, like the ginger grated to develop flavor. Thousand buddhas come to my aid, to tell your fortune and read your tarot. Ask me, thousand buddhas, to know where your future takes you. Accuracy guaranteed, come to have your fortune told. - Why not carry it with you? - It's full of treasures. I'd be insane to carry it. It is full of precious gems, it's too risky to take out. Keep your voice down, and go and get it. Oh, I see! This group of cripples is in cahoots with you! I am not with him! Ho Jen! So you are the handicap four! Indeed! You conned our godfather out of his treasure. - Give them back! - That was your godfather's ill-gotten gains. Why can't I borrow them for a while? You rascal! Look! You have a short life-line. How can a blind man read a palm? Even a blind man can tell that you are dead! Vairocana's palm one: The ray of Buddha. Two: A scattering of the Buddha's palm. Three: The Buddha's heart-piercing palm. Four... the Buddha's palm... It's "the Buddha's palm suffers cramp"! Chapter five is still to come: The Buddha waves his fan! Do you take me for a blind person? You wretched boy! You think you can perform drunken fist? Of course. I'm not drunk. This is "woken fist"! "Woken fist", very well. Chapter six: The Buddha swats a fly! That must be "the Buddha stubs his toe"! You can have a rest. Next one! Be careful, one-legged man! Steady yourself! Another phony one! The crutch comes in useful now. - Now... - Number three! How do you...? - It's his hat-trick. - Shut your mouth! "Spear to the heart" is my one-armed rod specialty. Few people have managed to dodge it. That ended too quickly. Bloodshed shows that you have lost. Dopey, it's just some cheap wine. Wine Why are you using both arms? By whatever means. That doesn't fit your image. Better put it back in. That looks more like it. Out of the way! Chapter ten: The Buddha escapes! Where are you going? This shop has the best wine I have ever tasted. As upright citizens, we deserve something nice. Sorry, excuse us, please. Is it now a crime to enjoy a tipple? We heard that jewelry thieves were here. You mean us? Do we look like we have anyjewels? We shall find out in the precinct. Please, let us explain. Explain it to our boss, come on! Don't go away, I'll be out in no time. Ho Jen is a good man. Release him as soon as possible. Yes, sir! - Hurry. - Yes, sir! Get lost! Hey, there he is! Master ho, thank you very much, we are most grateful. What are you thanking me for? We are grateful that you sent a jeweler to give so generously to our village. Hold on! What exactly have I given you? Jewels. So pretty. Intruder! Keep playing music. You are... Good old wang! You... how do you know me? - I more than know you. - Your voice... My voice? Sounds familiar? Oh, it's you! You have come to thank me for doing charity on your behalf, right? I can Rob the rich to give to the poor, if I want to. Why did you give away my treasure instead of your own? But my friend, yourjewels were stolen property. - And yours aren't? - I am a genuine jeweler. Fine, I'll Rob you, then. - You can't do that. - Why not? Give me the treasure. Oh, my poor bonsai tree. Crimson, help me! Crimson, you... I am... She is my bodyguard. I pay her handsomely, 500 taels. Don't I? Bodyguard? Right! You may know a bit of kung fu, but you are not in my league. My eyes don't grow on my fists. Are you afraid of fighting? - Yes, I am. - What? Are you afraid of killing him? Please, you mustn't kill him. - Just teach him a lesson. - Teach him? What can you teach me? Well done. Notbadindeed. You play good music, and you're even better at kung fu. Wonderful, but don't hit him too hard. My lute! You play lute, too? Not bad! Argh, help me! You practice internal kung fu? Careful! This is a ming antique. Ha! I know this style is called "hen flapping her wings". Very effective. He's got a dagger! Help, somebody help! Call the police. Great, with a sword we can play fairly. The window. - No more crimes. - What do you mean...? It's all right, don't chase him. I'll visit your commander to thank him in person. - Leave this to me, I'll sort things out. - Yes, sir. Let's head back. Crimson, are you all right? That's not right. How can a tiny scratch hurt so badly? These medicines are useless. What's the matter, sir? You said this would heal in three days, it's now five days! My head is still bleeding, what now? What now? We use the best ingredients, but your head... "Bezoar", "moschus"? These are poisoning me. Please, sir! Your injury looks odd, I can't help you. Are you saying it is incurable? - No, let me refer you to a specialist. - Who? Keep still. It's bad. What is it, doctor? - Your wound has been poisoned. - Poisoned? What kind of poison? - I don't know yet. - Is it incurable, doctor? In this case... I think you'd better ask whoever did this to give you the antidote. Crimson! Move! Out of the way, out of my way! What's wrong with you? Where's crimson? Don't touch me. Where's crimson? Where is crimson? Who's looking for crimson? Oh, it's you! What happened to your head? That's exactly why I want to see crimson. Where is she? Crimson has been so fortunate. Master wang redeemed her. Redeemed? Where does wang live? - Tell me, hurry up! - All right, I'll tell you. He stays in hotel tranquil, at the west gate. Master wang, this painting was the work of liu min-chun in the song dynasty. It is very lucky of you to have liu min-chun's work in your collection. I heard that, apart from prince qin in Beijing, master Yang is the only person who possesses his work. Prince qin is a well-known collector. Should we have the chance to be acquainted with him, that would be extremely fortunate for us. That'd be no problem. Prince qin likes to befriend people who collect fine arts and antiques. He also loves to sample good wines from canton. - As well as... - As well as... As well as me, a fellow merchant. It's Mr. Ho again! I can't tell from your attire what sort of business you do now. - Business, my ass! - Watch out! - What kind of barbarian are you? - It's fine. That's the way we greet good friends. Who's your good friend? Where have you hidden crimson? What? Crimson? The one on the entertainment boat. I see, you mean miss crimson. We only collect paintings and antiques, not women. Stop pretending, you old farts! - Where have you hidden crimson? - I have no idea. Please be careful. Won't you tell me? Mr. Ho, are you all right? My poor head... As. What are you playing at? My head was wounded by crimson's poisonous sword. None of the doctors here could help me. That's really bad. - I need her to give me the antidote. - She's long gone. What? What did you say? He's killing him, call the police! - What's that? - There's a murder. Hold on! It's a misunderstanding. This is a business greeting. - My head. - There's an antidote. Now... He has come all the way to discuss herbal medicine with me. I'm afraid I can't view the paintings and antiques any more. - Please accept my apologies. - All right, let's go then. - We'll do it some other time. - Really sorry. Put them away properly. I'll never reach crimson's standard of kung fu. But I have inherited the genuine formula for the antidote. - Quickly, give it to me, then. - Be patient. - Let us set the conditions first. - Conditions? Crimson told me, with this poison, the more stressed you are, the stronger it works on you. Just tell me the conditions now. - Be my disciple. - Damn you! Look at my fist. Can you beat that? I am not sure, but I can certainly beat your head! You just want to humiliate me. That's right, a disciple must knee! In front of his master. He must also kow-tow. The antidote. Kow-tow twice. Oh, dear! Just one dose remaining. Kow-tow thrice. Where's the formula? In here. You won't get the formula if you crack my head. Come here. Write it down. That won't do. I promised miss crimson that I wouldn't write out the antidote's formula. Othennise, I'd be punished by the gods. So where does crimson live? She is leading a hermetic life. I can give you one dose of the antidote every three days, if you stay with me. Then your head will gradually heal. All right, I'll stay here. That won't do. I have got another room ready for you. So you planned this all along! Exactly. I want to keep you on the straight and narrow. - You...! - Go wait for me in the other room. I'll make up your antidote. Wait. You haven't addressed me as master. But ... master! I have already acted as you have instructed me, prince four. I have informants everywhere. He will be killed as soon as he appears. Your highness should not exert yourself to come all the way to canton. - Stupid slave! - Your highness. You are too indiscreet. I've come to deal with this matter. Had the emperor got wind of it, I'd lose my head. - You're useless. - Your highness. - I can deal with it personally. - You will not! You are a general, he'd recognize you. You will stay hidden until the very end. Your highness is saying... His purpose of coming to canton is to sample the local wines and to purchase antiques and paintings. See if you can find a way using this ruse. Your highness! There are some more. My disciple! Where are you going? What kind of master are you? You just drink all day while I am confined in here. All those antiques and lousy paintings do not interest me at all. I need to go out to stretch my limbs. Goodbye! Little boy. - Who are you talking to? - You. - Do I look like a little boy? - I am sorry. - But where is master wang? - There! Who's looking for me? This guy! My disciple, you must be courteous to my guests. Show him in. What? Show him in? Come in. Watch your step. - I am delivering an invitation. - Who from? Let me see. What does it say? It's from my master fan tin-Kong. Fan tin-Kong, owner of a winery. He hosts wine-tasting sessions. - Disciple! - What's the matter now? Aren't you bored? Mr. Fan invites me on board the drunken fairy, to sample the vintage he has just made. You can come with me. Good idea, I miss the entertainment boat. Thank you, master fan, for bringing me here to taste your premium aged cantonese vintage. You are most welcome. I hear that Mr. Wang is a connoisseur of wine. It is lucky that you have come to canton, and are willing to try our humble wines. This is a rare occasion. Let us drink another cup. - Serve the guest. - Yes, sir. Please. Disciple! Where are your manners? Come stand by your master! You think I really take you for my master? I do it for... Isn't it good enough? Come greet master fan properly. There is no need. Let your disciple sit over there and enjoy some music. - Master wang, let's drink another cup. - Cheers. - So smooth. - This is not very refined. - Lok. - Yes, sir? - Haven't we prepared something special? - Indeed. We have nine 100-year vintage wines. - What's the first one? - Turtle and deer. That's an unusual name. - Would you like to try some? - I'd love to. Please. Please sit on this side. - Please sit down. - Please. Here's the wine. It's special indeed. - Please. - Thank you. Is this how you drink it? No, not like this. You should drink it this way. It'd be rude to drink alone, I should offer you one first. You are too kind. Lok, get me the wine. Master wang, please. Master wang, how does the "turtle and deer" wine taste? Smooth and aromatic, it is simply wonderful. - Pour him another cup. - Yes. Master fan, is there a second type of wine? "Five dragons and two tigers". With both dragons and tigers, it must be very strong. Indeed. Please. Please. - Very aromatic. - Glad you like it. Worth savoring. Have another one. The dragon leaps. The tiger crouches. It does not seem typical to canton. Master wang is indeed a wine expert. There are many exquisite wines to be tried. Would you care to move over there? Master fan, what is this wine called? It's cantonese wine: "Three snakes banish the cold". Which three snakes are used? The gall bladder of cobra, banded krait and rat snakes form a wine that's good for impotence. This young man is very knowledgeable. Oh, you're from Beijing! This fan is worth three taels. - Eagle eyes. - So... Shut up. Master fan and I are enjoying a pleasant wine-tasting session. - Go play on your own. - Great, I'll be off. Wait. Mind your head. All right, I'll wait for you outside. Please. The combination of three snakes is interesting. Please. You hold your drink very well. - "Black rooster and white hen". - Certainly. Please. These Phoenix cups are exquisite. "Tiger bones and papaya". "Tiger bones and papaya". - Cheers. - Cheers. They look completely drunk. Self-proclaimed master, are you going? My disciple. It is a joy to find out the origin of a well-aged vintage wine. What's that? Everything is from canton. What do you know? You are not from Beijing. Just wait there. What's so special about Beijing? Throwing your weight about... A monkey? "Monkey and deer antlers". Master fan, let's call it a day. Are your wines delivered from Beijing? Sit down. Master fan, you are well-prepared. Indeed, until you fall down. Whose idea is this? I arranged for a drinking session, for the rest, you don't need to know. There are more wines. Would you care to try? I'm not one to get drunk. Master! He is already drunk. You are next. Master fan, you are really drunk. You should stop now. Thank you for treating me with so many cantonese wines. We'll do it again. Good evening. Master fan, I'll see myself out. He can't hold his drink. - Master, shall we go now? - All right. They... - They're just drunk. - And you? A bit tipsy. - You look after them. - Yes, master wang. Let's go home. They were loyal to the prince, and both made the ultimate sacrifice. They never exposed their identities. They are your role models. I shall always abide by your orders. - Are you confident of success? - Absolutely. Even if these shoes don't get him, he won't be able to resist these paintings. Your head still needs some time to heal. How many more doses of ointment do I still need? Do you know him? Cordially inviting master wang it's just an invitation. From chu yi-feng. What does this man do? He is an antique dealer. I don't know him, I have no interest in antiques. This antidote is sufficient to heal your wound. What trick are you playing this time? How do I know that this is the real stuff? I would rather stick to the rules, so make me an antidote every three days. Then you must stay with me. Very good. You are loyal to me. Stay with me, and I will take care of you. You must, othennise my head could rot. Messenger! Master money. Tell your master, to get out the rarest antiques for me to examine properly. Certainly. Please come in. Master, the guests are here. Oh, so you are master chu? Yes, and you are...? I am master wang... his disciple. He is master wang. Master wang, this way, please. Oh, you mean all thisjunk are antiques? Ho Jen! What do you know? Where are your manners? Manners? Please take a seat. - Please. - Please. Master chu, your merchandise has interesting origins. I am glad you appreciate them. - Let us look at something else. - Very well. Ho Jen! Antiques are for your appreciation, not for you to use. Master chu, am I right? Please, have a look. Oh, this... - Song dynasty. - Ming dynasty. This one is carved from black stone. This is a rarity from two dynasties ago. You don't see this often now. This one is a black stone bowl. It displays the finest carving skills, and... It's carved from a stone that weighed 30 catties. Can you guess its weight? Master, I know, it weighs two catties. What do you know? It only weighs 16 taels, am I right? We'd better be careful. You are right. Master wang, these are not very refined. I have more precious items from the tang and ming dynasties. I would like to show you. We have come here to study your precious collections. We need to examine them closely to understand the origins. You are absolutely right. My disciple is not interested in such finery. He'd better wait for me outside. That's right. I am no connoisseur like you any way. And I can'tjuggle like you do. Why are you staring at me? I won't break like those plates. As long as master wang is with me, he can go outside. Yes, master. Let us continue. It was so strange. Why did they try to stop me from leaving? This is a white Jade scepter from the tang dynasty. It's a wonderful carving. Glad you like it. This scepter is very hard. Wonderful. Just wonderful. You are too kind, master wang. Master chu, is this from the royal court? They are still sitting down chatting, it should be all right. Is there anything else to study? Coming up. A daffodil pot with a sunflower detail from the song dynasty. - South or north song? - Late south song. Watch out! This is a lovely dish. You are very good, master wang. - Who gave you these items? - Telling you would spoil the atmosphere. - There are more items. - What items? Some painting scrolls that are beyond your imagination. Please. This is a famous painting from the five dynasties. Really exquisite. There's more. Very strong strokes. - Full of energy. - Indeed. It is very rare. All the turning and spinning. What a strange way to view paintings. Those shoes have blades? Why are you fighting? My master knows kung fu! Well done! Don't kill me, prince! Who in the royal court sent you to assassinate me? I dare not say, I dare not! My servant! You can speak the truth in front of your prince eleven. Prince eleven? Speak, now! - Prince seven. - Who exactly? I have sworn to secrecy. He would kill me if! Sp... He would kill you, and I could also kill you. I'll speak. The secret message is hidden in a painting scroll. - You highness would know who it was. - Show me! Master! - Master! - Help me get out of here, quick! His disciple... Ho Jen ... General, his rescuer is the bodyguard that he hired in canton. Do you know his background? He does business with outlaws. That's in our favor. Go and find out his whereabouts from places where outlaws congregate. - Doctor... - Wait... When will his injury heal? It is a deep cut that goes into the bone. Nine ligaments and tendons are injured. When the wound closes up, he will still be unable to walk properly. Will he be lame forever? It won't be that bad. Over time, he will fully recover. Say no more, I understand these things. - Let the doctor go home. - Yes, master. Temple of the mountain god you know the drill, don't tell anyone we are here. Don't you worry. I am not new to the way you people work. This is your fee. One more thing. What's the matter? Does the emperor have eleven princes? More, there are fourteen princes. Yes, that's right, fourteen. But I wonder who the throne will be passed to. That's exactly why they've been fighting, they all want to be emperor. I understand. Good day. I won't compete for the throne. I am not interested in being emperor. I want a life full of antiques, great paintings, and all sorts of fine wines. But most important of all is martial arts practice. No wonder you came to canton... Your kung fu skill... Martial arts should be applied with good intentions. If you abuse the arts to Rob others of their lives or property, you bring shame to the kung fu community. You must remember this. You are free to go now. I will only go when you are fully recovered. - I can look after myself. - Even doctors cannot cure themselves. - If the assassins try again... - We'll fight! Your martial arts skill... It's not good enough, but... I would like you to accept me as your disciple, master! Practice your kicks. Stop! - You kick too high. - But isn't that more powerful? Any martial arts practitioner would notice your weakness. Notice what? Turn around. Kick both sides. Pay attention to your shoulders. Now kick! Quicker! Don't stop! Kick backwards! You've broken the dishes, what are you applauding? I am not applauding, master. My hands got burnt. So you don't want to practice anymore? Yes, I'll practice. Stop! When you did consecutive kicks just now, you exerted your thighs but not the calves. That's why your shoulders weren't level. Did you know that this business deal is worth 5,000 taels of gold? Five thousand! Advisor, can we handle such a major business? It's a piece of cake! Do you know a man who often does business with you? His name is ho Jen. Is it Jen or gen? Ho Jen? Ho Jen is not worth that much. It's the injured man who is with him. That man is worth 5,000 taels of gold. - Advisor! - Listen carefully. If you can deliver that man to me, dead or alive, you'll get 5,000 taels of gold. But I must remind you, I'll share it with you 50-50. Let me do the sums... But... I get 2,500 for going through the advisor. If I go to the general, I'll get 5,000. Come sit down, seven agonies of the east. What's the matter? I have an idea... To share with you. Good. Both kicking and withdrawing have to be swift. Keep the shoulders level. My legs are turning to charcoal, so I kick swiftly to put out the flames. Shut up, keep practicing. Kick back! That's right! Arms and legs strike at the same time. This is also a martial arts style. You must kick so no one sees. It's nicknamed "invisible kicks". Master, I think I am turning into a crispy roasted pig. Brute force won't work. Be alert! There's somebody. - Who is it? - It's me. Master, it's a lady. Not just one. - There are seven or eight. - Seven or eight? You mustn't hang around with women during martial arts training. I'm sure they've got the wrong place. - Who are you after? - I'm come for ho Jen. - They have come for me. - How come? - Did you tell people about this place? - I did not. Who exactly are you? We are the seven agonies from the east. Oh, they are seven alligators. Ask them what they want. What do you want me for? I have a great business deal to offer you as a partner. I never have any deals with any women. These people are very suspicious. Master, you stay in your room. Let me deal with them. What kind of man takes so long to open the door? Do you want me to storm the house? Open the door, quickly, open the door! - Open up! - Coming. Hurry up! Open up! Quickly! Open up! May I ask what business you ladies have for me? Where are the ladies? All you men care about is the ladies. So you are the seven alligators from the east? What are you talking about? Do we look that vicious? We are not "alligators", we are "agonies". Oh, are you praying at this time at night? You are so pious. - I am practicing... - Practicing magic? Magic, my foot! What do you people want? You get straight to the point, I like you. - You got some good stuff with you. - Good stuff? It's worth a lot. If you are willing to part with it, you can get 5,000 taels of gold. - What could be worth that? - The gentleman who stays with you. Ho Jen, work with us, we can share the 5,000 taels. You want my co-operation? What makes you think that you're capable of working with me? We have lots of abilities. We, the seven agonies, are all hard people, but I am more gentle. Therefore I'm known to the community as "outpouring agony". No wonder you talk so much, agony aunt! You look so tense, it seems you're itching to fight. That suits us fine. One of us is called "enduring agony". Don't worry, he won't hit you back. Just hit as hard as you can. Hence he's known as "enduring agony". Well done. Exhausted? We have "cry in agony". When you cry in agony, try our "agony look". You sound and look like agony, now try "causing agony". Are you in agony? "Why do you look for agony?" Why do you look for agony? Pile and piles of glistening gold, enough to dazzle you. Why turn it down and seek only agony? I'm enjoying this! I'm loving this! And you? You're too heavy, I'm not enjoying it. For stubborn people, we have "agony tea". Drink, drink it all. Once you have drunk agony tea, your personality changes completely. See? Instant changes. He changes. Keep changing. So will you work with us? Of course, I'll do anything, darling. Are the seven agonies any good? - You're simply brilliant. - Are we? Why, you don't intimidate me, you old witch! So you won't share the windfall with us? No problem. Ever seen a mug with such big arms? I have seen all sizes, but not as strong as these. Oh, you want to fight? Enduring agony! Disciple! Come here. - It's him. Go get him! - Get him while you can. Steady yourself, calm down. With this stack of paper, you will never have to worry about poverty. My master knows you need to feed yourself. With these bills of credit, you will be able to enjoy life anywhere you want. How do we know they won't bounce? What nonsense? This is from the royal court. Beijing, yunnan, suzhou, hangzhou, sichuan or even jiuzhou, - it is easy to make a transfer. - How much is each worth? There are 50, 60, 70, 70, 80, 80 and 90 taels. 500 taels in total. In silver or gold? - Gold, of course. - Gold, it's gold! What's wrong? Master, am I any good? - Give them the bills. - Yes. Search it! He's better than we thought. Even those outlaws didn't manage to spot them. It is already July 3rd. The emperor is going to announce his successor in two months. Pass down my order, send more people to closely monitor all the roads leading to Beijing. - He won't fall through any cracks. - Yes! Good, strike and defend in turn, no gaps. Why have you stopped? Master, it's only a fortnight before we know who succeeds to the throne. What if you haven't recovered bythen? That is exactly why I practice with you day and night. - So we can fight. - Master... We've been here for over a month, yet we haven't heard anything. It looks like they're afraid to fight you. - No, they must have something planned. - What kind of plans? Get a stronger staff tomorrow to make me a crutch. I need a cart. And lots of umbrellas. Master, your crutch is ready. And the other two items? The umbrellas and the cart will be ready when we leave tomorrow. Have you heard any news? Nothing at all, none of those people have appeared. So I guessed right. They will intercept us on our way back. We don't have to fear them at all, we are well-prepared. Don't ever underestimate them. There are many martial art experts at court. You haven't practiced for very long. Remember: When you fight them, don't stray too far away from me. Your highness master, it's strange, as soon as we got here, the wind picked up. This place is known to be blustery. People built this town to shield them from the gales. Yet the town wasn't sturdy enough, so it gradually collapsed. No wonder it's deserted. Hey, didn't I tell you not to stray too far from me? Your highness master, why do you have to take this route? It's so treacherous and deserted. If we want to take the shortest route, we must go through this town. - Push! - Oh, yes. Stop! reverse! Master, the umbrellas are well-made. It's a Mongolian warrior's cape. Be extra careful. Oh, it's a Mongolian staff. Who sent you to kill prince eleven? You were sent by general liang! Speak! Disciple, we don't have much time. Take him back with us. No, don't shoot! Phnce_.fouh it's prince four! It's prince four! My fourth brother? - But how...? - Go! Your highness master, are these soldiers here to welcome you back? He wants to block the internal gate, so I can't reach the emperor's apartment. - We'll fight our way in. - We can't. If we did, we'd alarm the whole royal court. My father would not take it kindly if he knew I'd gone to the south. We'll take a detour, go in through the northern courtyard. - Ninth brother, where's our 11th brother? - How would I know? Do you know his whereabouts? Our 11th brother is not back yet? That's out of character. Prince eleven. It's been too long. General liang jincheng. Are you for the court, or for yourself? It doesn't matter. How dare you? You try to block prince eleven's return to hear the succession appointment. Who's behind this? - Ho Jen! - Your highness! This is a matter for the royal family. It's none of our subjects' business. Absolutely! - Ho Jen. - Your highness! - These are all strong fighters. Be careful. - Yes! Strike from both sides! Caiyang blade fight! Come on! Watch his blade! - You deal with those two. - Yes. Your highness master, general liang jincheng's unique caiyang blade is unsurpassable. Of course, when the general was stationed at the border, he was known for his bravery and skill. - What did he achieve? - Hundreds of huns died under his blade. Impressive! General liang! - On whose instruction do you act? - Shut up! You have no right. The emperor has arrived! Eleventh brother! Fourth brother! Your official hat. We wish our father a life that lasts tens of thousands of years! At ease, all of you. Thank you, father. Your official beads. - Take it away. - But it's your crutch.
