Mahabharata... It's not the story of a war. It's the story of virtue. It's the story of our country. Based on the Adi Parva (First Chapter) of Panchama Veda (Fifth Veda)... penned by Maharshi Vyasa. This story that follows Abhignyana Shakunthalam Written by great poet Kalidasa Its a love story that doesn't fade away for many eras. (baby laughing) (baby continues to laugh) (baby crying) (baby laughing) Hey Sharadvatha! You claim that you are the favourite disciple of our Holy Guru. - Yeah. - Tell me the name of this grass. Grass is just grass. How can I tell you by name? There are ten kinds of grass, you dumb-wit. Kusham, Kaasham, Yavvam, Doorvam, Vishwamitram, Usiram. Kundaram, Godhumam, Vrihim, Munjam. (baby crying) An infant in this forest? (baby crying) Holy Guru... this infant... Holy Guru, I wonder who is her mother! The first abandoned baby on this earth. Indra sent Menaka to create a disruption in Viswamitra's holy penance. His holy penance was disturbed. This baby is born out of Menaka and Viswamitra's love. She left the baby behind as humans are forbidden to enter the heavens. Poor little thing. Born to an Angel, but ended up an orphan! She won't be an orphan. I will raise her. Does that mean that she would stay with us in our Ashram? Yes, son. A bachelor like me who gave up worldly relations to attain Advaitha... is gifted this bond by time. Kashyapa Praajapathi (Lord of creatures) is hinting us something from the Kashyapa Valleys. This is our responsibility in shaping up of a great future. This baby is so cute! What do we name her, Holy Guru? This baby was nurtured by Shakunta birds. - We shall call her Shakunthala. - (disciples in unison) Shakunthala? (disciples in unison) Hey! Shakunthala! (children laughing) (tiger roaring) (girl screaming) Oh no! The tiger is about to kill the girl! Someone save her! - Save her! - Tiger! Oh no! A tiger! Run! It's a tiger! (horses neighing) A tiger! (chaos) (tiger growls) Someone save the kid! (tiger roars) - You saved our day, sire! - It's my baby! May god bless you, sire! Oh Dushyanta! You crossed the river Malini for us? Wild animals are on a rampage. - Save us, lord! - Sire! Sire! Please save us from these beasts! Not just the lives of the people in the forest. My duty is also to protect the freedom of the animals in the forest. Have no fear. Our soldiers would get you to a safe haven. Look there! Where? Oh no! A streak of tigers! (tiger roars) (birds chirping) (peafowl squawks) (tiger growls) Looks like it's emperor Dushyanta! Indeed! It's the emperor himself! Greetings! Sreedatta. Please welcome the emperor with all due respect. What a surprise! Are there non-dangerous ones in wild animals too? There are, sire. It is the effect of living in a hermitage. You mean this place is... This is the hermitage of the holy rishi Kanva. Hunting might be an entertainment to you. But isn't protecting their free life the duty of nature? It is the duty of the king too. We bow to your righteousness, oh king! We request you refresh yourself in our hermitage. (Rishis chanting) (Rishis chanting) (birds chanting along) (chanting continues) (animals chanting along) (chanting ends) Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Oh Shakunthala! Hey Sulakshana and Souparnika! Did you come across Shakunthala? Oh she went this way? Come. Netrika, where is Shakunthala? She says that way! Chaitrika and Swapnika, where is Shakunthala? She went that way! Oh my! This sweet danger that you are in, Probably the great emperor Dushyanta himself should save you from it. Emperor Dushyanta! Oh emperor Dushyanta! These butterflies are trying to rob our friend of her sweetness! Please save her, oh king! "In the great Himalayas, in the hermitage adjacent to river Malini" "I saw an eternal beauty and am stupefied by her magical charm" "Who is this blooming young girl? Who is this stealer of hearts?" "Who is this frost bud? Who could this shining star be?" "Is she a heavenly damsel? But they don't wink their eyes!" "Is she a forest beauty? But she isn't wearing jute fabric!" "Is she a statue of gold? But a golden statue can't walk!" "Who is this blooming young girl? Who is this stealer of hearts?" "Who is this divine beauty?" "How do I define her beauty?" I wonder who this brave young man is! Shakunthala. Ah! Have the souls exchanged already? In which case... are you Shakunthala, the daughter of Menaka and Viswamitra? Oh! It was in my thought that she wasn't a girl from hermitage. But either a princess or a divine damsel. So she is a divine princess! Rishi Kanva's adopted daughter too. Also, she is the best friend of Anasuya and Priyamvada. (gasps) Careful with the slip! A slip is destined if the knot isn't right. And now that the slip has happened, the right knot is destined! Nature should be free. Why do you restrict it? Enough of your creativity! The brave young man better reveal his identity. Me? (elephant trumpets) Oh my god! Looks like an elephant entered the hermitage! (elephant trumpeting) (elephant trumpeting) (elephant trumpeting) (elephant trumpeting) (elephant trumpeting) Did you hear this? The gods have granted our wish. That brave young man is none other than Emperor Dushyanta. - Emperor? - Yes. - Hail the valorous Dushyanta! - (crowd) Hail! - Long live brave Dushyanta! - (crowd) Long live! - Hail the valorous Dushyanta! - (crowd) Hail! - The one who won over the elephant. - (crowd) Hail! - Hail the valorous Dushyanta! - (crowd) Hail! - Long live brave Dushyanta! - (crowd) Long live! You have saved my energy, friend! You opted to tame it. I'd have slain it! Friend! A bumblebee! A bumblebee? Where is it? You lied my friend! I was scared there was really a bumblebee. Did you witness it, Mother Gauthami? An angry elephant itself has bowed down before the emperor. What happened is actually a bad omen. I sense something wrong especially when Rishi Kanva is not here. Danger! Danger! There is news that the Kalanemi demons are about to attack the hermitage. They are coming to disrupt the yagna. We have to be careful! Shakunthala, let's head to the ashram. (demons): Hail the king! The Kalanemi leader! Hail the king! The Kalanemi leader! Slaying of gods and humans is the art of demon war. Hail the king! The Kalanemi leader! Hail the king! The Kalanemi leader! They said that the Kalanemi demons are about to attack the hermitage. Who are the Kalanemi demons? Don't you know? Demon king Ugranemi who is planning to topple the world. His brothers Athikrodhanemi and Vikrodhanemi. In the aeon Tretha... remember Mareecha, who cast an illusion on Sita in the form of a golden deer? - Kalanemi is his son. - (demons): Hail Kalanemi! And these are his successors. (demons): Hail Kalanemi! Hail Kalanemi! They are known to obstruct important matters and waste time. How is wasting time dangerous? Should we be so scared for such a small issue? You know, one can win mighty wars by wasting time! At the time of battle between Rama and Ravana... When Lakshmana was hit by Indrajit's arrow and fell unconscious... Rama was heart broken. Then Susena asked for the Sanjeevani herb before the sunrise. Then Hanuman flew over to these Himalayas and started searching for Sanjeevani herb. Ravana sent Kalanemi to somehow waste Hanuman's time till the daybreak. Kalanemi took the form of a sage and went to Hanuman. He said "Oh Hanuman! You take a dip in the lake and be my guest" "Then I shall help you find the Sanjeevani herb" he said. When Hanuman got into the lake to take a dip The evil Kalanemi sent a crocodile on to Hanuman. The crocodile leapt on him to devour him. He strangled it with his tail. And lo! The crocodile lay dead and transformed into a celestial dancer. What happened then? It said "Oh son of the wind! I am a celestial dancer." "I was turned into a crocodile by a curse" It is an honour to be slain by a great person like you. I am liberated from my curse. She disclosed Kalanemi's identity and his evil plans to waste Hanuman's time. Evil Kalanemi took his original form and attacked Hanuman with his sword. Hanuman immediately killed Kalanemi. He lifted the entire mountain along with Kalanemi's body and got it back. Why do we need to fear these demons after Kalanemi is dead? Not just time, they can waste lives too. Oh my god! What do we do now? Here we are, scared about losing our lives and look at her! Her life is somewhere else right now. Oh Dushyanta! Huh? Deer eyes, walk of a peafowl... and a waist of a lioness! Did you hear that, lieutenant? This man doesn't value human lives as much as he values animal body parts! I am ten years older than him but he simply doesn't pay heed to my words! Enough of your imaginations, we all shall start at once. We shall start by daybreak. That's all. Huh? Why are we leaving? What happened? Nothing happened till now! We wish that nothing should happen. Untimely meals upset our health. Poor soldiers are snoring as they had no sleep. We are dead scared that that's some wild animals growling. Why are you so scared, my friend? Poor animals, they hunt for a living. But we hunt for pleasure. There is no cruel animal than humans in this world. Dear Mahipala. In order to protect the villagers and the wild animals alike... Started again. Relocate the villages safely out of the forest. Wise thought. Orders will be followed, oh emperor! We have a meeting with the vassals on the second day of the month. Sire, young sages from Rishi Kanva's Ashram are here to meet you. Oh great king! Our Guru Rishi Kanva is performing a great Homa in Somateertham. We have to perform a connecting Yagna here. But a group of demons are approaching fast to disrupt our efforts. Oh god! You are a great warrior who helped Indra in the war between gods and demons. Be the protector of this homa that's being done for the good of the world. We urge you to help our cause. Please help us, King. No power can stop a good cause. Protecting the Yaga is my duty. Be rest assured. May you be victorious. Did you hear them, my friend? Do I have an option, my friend? Mahipala would accompany me with the army in this great duty. You represent me at the meeting with the vassals. At once! Oh no! It's midnight and it's a forest. I better don't. I'll leave in the morning. (chanting sudarshana mantra) (chanting lakshmi mantra) (demons roaring) (demons shouting) (day end bell ringing) (sages): The Yaga is completed! - (soldier): Hail emperor of Puru dynasty! (sages): The Yaga is completed! - (soldier): Hail emperor of Puru dynasty! - (soldiers)Hail! - (soldier): Hail Dushyanta the valiant! - (soldiers): Hail! - (soldier): Hail emperor of Puru dynasty! - (soldiers)Hail! - (soldier): Hail Dushyanta the valiant! - (soldiers): Hail! - (soldier): Hail emperor of Puru dynasty! - (soldiers)Hail! - (soldier): Hail Dushyanta the valiant! - (soldiers): Hail! - (soldier): Hail emperor of Puru dynasty! - (soldiers)Hail! - (soldier): Hail Dushyanta the valiant! - (soldiers): Hail! Our time was wasted at an unforeseen war. The Yagna was completed without any hassles. We have to finish Dushyanta who used our time wasting skill back on us! What if this Yagna was successful? We shall start a lot of problems from now on. Don't rest till you kill the enemy who interrupted us. Go! We hail from the clan of Mareecha who cheated Rama. We possess the blood of Kalanemi who cheated Hanuman. We belong to the Kalanemi dynasty that can stop even the time. Now even Lord Vigneswara can't stop us from being victorious. (demons): Hail Kalanemi! Oh king! Mantra is equal to holy OM. Yagna is engulfing. The one who facilitates both of these is equal to Lord Shiva. You have supported our cause like Lord Shiva. These are some Yaga protector's gifts for you.. May you be happy always. We request you to be our guest for some more time. A king always follows what the sages say. May you get married soon. Mahipala... You go back to Pratishtanapura along with the army. I shall take rest here for some more time. Your orders will be followed, emperor. (birds chirping) (koel cooing) See this! The lily garland has withered by the heat of your body. Why did that happen? Usually, body has it's own temperature. But this is love fever. You can say the heat of passion. Heart would be on fire. It would continue to be that way till you douse it. I didn't understand. It doesn't make sense. Well that is called love! Is love new to me? Don't I love my father? Don't I love you both? Netrika, Swapnika, Mallika and Malathi, don't I love all of you? This love is different. Love on your father lasts till you leave the house. Love on friends lasts till you remember them. But your husband's love stays with you like our breath till you live. I mean a man's love. Dushyanta's love for our Shakunthala. He is a stranger. Isn't it wrong? Is knowing a human greater than knowing their heart? Sages have advised not to follow one's heart. You think the great Viswamitra doesn't know what sages advised? What are you born with? All the curves and beauty of Menaka. It is wrong to talk like that about mother. The daughter should not look like this too. What do I do then? Only the one who is the reason of your pain can understand your condition. Write a love letter to him! Oh no! I won't do that. Let's leave, dear. Neither would she cool down, nor does she need our help. That's alright. You suggest me what to write. Turn your heart into words. Here. Netrika, you should'nt look into others' letters. Go! (Shakunthala gasps) No! Don't see it. Show us. (Shakunthala gasps in surprise) Lord, now the butterflies of your thoughts are troubling me even more. I wonder which arrows you would use to save me! (scoffs) They say that this pain is called love. That's quite a burden. I want to feel unburdened. But even after that, the burden is sweet. I feel that I don't own myself anymore. I feel like even my breath belongs to you. Err... listen Netrika. Mother is searching for you. Come. Anasuya. What? Do I need to tell you too? Come along. I have never wished for anything. But now I wish for you. I have you in my heart but I also want you to be with me now. Pardon me my lord. I have fallen for you without your permission. I did the same as you did. I have fallen for you without your permission, Shakunthala. I hope you would pardon me. Wait... Lord... Am I troubling you? It is you who is killing me. I want to live. I want to take birth again. I want to be born out of your womb. Now it's your responsibility to rear the Puru dynasty. A new country should be born from your womb. Would you grant my wish? Shakunthala! (Shakunthala gasps in fear) - Oh no! It is Mother Gauthami! - Shakunthala. - What happened? - It's Mother Gauthami! Come with me. - Where to? - (Mother Gauthami): Shakunthala! Come here. Stay behind this tree. Don't come out. I have never hid even at war. Well well... one can't win the war of love without hiding. Dear one... I've heard that you were unwell. How are you feeling now? I'm alright mother. You've been unwell. Won't you catch a cold if you wander in the fog? Let's go to the hermitage. Come, dear! Come. Mallika and Malathi! I feel like staying with you. But I will come back later. OK? Let's go. Oh moon! Who said moonlight is cool? You are burning me totally! Do you even know that moonlight without a loved one is hotter than a sunny day? Hey Cupid! You are tormenting me a lot! The pride that I get out of resting my head on my queen's bosom... isn't something that I get even by wearing my crown. I became a real king only after I won her heart. Well well... even you are a living being. Are you aware of this longing? Did you ever face that painful moment where you longed for your lover's beauty? Get my girl to me then. Save me, my lord. What happened, my dear? I'm afraid im committing a sin. Innocent one... How can this be a sin? One should never control love. We can meet without getting married, but you should not burn in longing. Alright. Let's get married in the presence of elders following all rituals. Let us get married right now and right here. It's us who are the elders at our wedding. Just both of us are the witnesses. And of course the five forces of nature are. There they are. Netrika, Swapnika and Hansika. Your friends Malathi and Malika... All of them are witnesses for our love and marriage. You are the daughter of a Rajarshi. Isn't wedding by Gandharva tradition a common royal custom? Is a wedding without a holy thread valid under the Gandharva tradition? The three knots of the holy thread bind you to stay together through righteousness, wealth and pleasure Hearts are bound that way. But why do two entwined hearts need the thread, Shakunthala? This wedding of ours by Gandharva tradition is acceptable by our custom. "Paradise in hermitage" "Burning flames in ice cold mountains" "The first chapter in the saga of love" "The forest is the witness for this marriage" "There was no formal choosing of the groom" "He himself fell in love with me" "He released a sweet arrow of love" "He won over my tender heart" "Paradise in hermitage" "Burning flames in ice cold mountains" (rishis chanting mantras) "When I was out in the forest fetching flowers" "Love bloomed when I saw you" "When I was hunting in the forest" "Cupid struck me" "Butterflies felt bad" "They felt the beauty of this girl belongs to them" "The bumblebees waged a war" "They felt the nectar of this flower belongs to them" "They quarrelled with me that I stole this beauty from them" "Its you..." "With me..." "There was no formal choosing of the groom" "He himself fell in love with me" "The river of love has to cross all boundaries" "And has to one day meet the sea" "Enough of the nurturing at the banks of river Malini" "It's time to leave your grove, oh sweet bird" "The welcoming world out there" "Is waiting for us" "A pure life ahead" "Welcomes us" "Oh wild moonlight, come to rule the kingdom beside me." "Myself..." "Becoming one with me" "Paradise in hermitage" "Burning flames in ice cold mountains" (Rishis): Om Namah Shivaya. Om Namah Shivaya. Om Namah Shivaya. I bow to you, the leader of all gods. I bow to you Lord Shiva. I bow to you, the one who rides the holy bull and is present in the sound 'Na'. Om Namah Shivaya. (Rishis): Om Namah Shivaya. - Sharadvata. - Yes Guru. - Saaragnarava. - Yes Guru. The Yaga is completed successfully. Let us start for the Ashram. Start the preparations. - As you say, Guru. - Guru... Does this mean that Shakunthala is free from her astrological setbacks? No one can avoid Karma. Shankuntala is born for a cause. She is about to make history. My dear Shakunthala. Do you know how heartbroken Holy Guru would be when he learns about what happened? You must somehow reveal this to the Holy Guru in the right way, Mother. Shakunthala. Are you hesitating to say something, my child? I fell in love with emperor Dushyanta who came for hunting from Pratishtanapura. Even he fell in love with me. Father, right from my childhood I never knew that outsiders can also love me. I have experienced that love for the first time. I wanted all that love for myself and forever. I was afraid of losing it. Father... We entered into wedlock by the Gandharva tradition without seeking your permission. We didn't stop there. We united physically too. Where is king Dushyanta? Amid the floral showers from Indra and other gods... With the cheering of the people of Pratishthanapura. I'll take you to the royal fort and make you the queen of Jambu island... Following all formal royal rituals. Don't worry, my dear. I lost the love of my parents by birth. What if I lose your love too? How can love not be with you, Shakunthala? You are the symbol of love. The Great Rishi Kanva who was away from worldly bonds was bonded by your love. You even won the love of the flora and fauna here. With your love, you've enslaved this emperor brimming with the pride of victory Here... this is the memory of our love. This is not just my ring. This is my heart. Shall I start then? Shall I take leave? The almighty who guides our life will choose the life partner for us. Your wedding was destined. May you be happy in wedlock always. An emperor's son rules the future. But your son will build the future, my child. So would he come back to get me, Father? Dushyanta is a righteous person. He will definitely welcome you and treat you with care. "Oh my dear Mallika, Malathi and Malika" "Look if my husband is coming for me." "Oh my dear Mallika, Malathi and Malika" "Look if my husband is coming for me." "Oh Hamsika, don't delay anymore" "Go and get the king along with you" "I have a gift for him" "Today would be a celebration of love" (Friends): "Oh beautiful girl, the spring is here" "You'd soon be the ruling queen when your king gets you" "Our divine hermitage has bloomed with love everywhere" "How can you control your heart, oh tender girl?" "Oh Swapnika, Chaitrika and my beloved Nethrika" "Look if my husband is coming for me."

"Looks like the land is icy like my heart is now" "However cold it could become" "Let me protect his child warmly" "Even if the season of fall withers all hopes" "Let me become the spring to bring in fresh hopes" "Why are you worried at a time of giving birth" "There is no need of worry when you are blessed" "Time passed gracefully" "Oh innocent pure one, look at your blessing" "My eyes await, longing is unbearable now" "I still await his arrival" (in Sanskrit) Salutations oh sun god, the only eye of the world The cause of the birth, sustenance and destruction of the world The repository of the three forms, the protector of the three gunas in the self The forms of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Come here. I wonder what ill fate awaits us! He looks like a great saint. Why are you so scared of him, Priyamvada? Who do you think he is, Anasuya? He is the great Rishi Durvasa. Durvasa? What kind of a name is that? 'Dur'vasa means someone with whom you can't live along with. Oh! I wonder which moment Great Rishi Athri and Mother Anasuya named him. - He lives up to his name! - Oh! So he is the son of Anasuya? My mother said they named me after her. Shh! You're lucky that they didn't name you Durvasini after him. Sages are kind, aren't they? How can it be tough to live along with him? Anger! He has too much anger for a person! - Too much anger? - Yeah. Not just ordinary anger. It's just out of bounds. Great Rishi Athri and Mother Anasuya have got Lord Shiva's anger as a son. Do you know that? Strange! What is their story? Let us go and see if Shakunthala needs something. She needs King Dushyantha. We can't bring him can we? Tell me the story. Come on! One day, Lord Brahma got into an argument with Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva was very angry. The entire universe was shaking with his anger. The gods ran away saying "Lord! We are even unable to approach you!" Even in such shaking anger, Lord Shiva uderstood something. He wanted to leave his anger. But where is a place in the universe that could bear his anger? Mother Anasuya was pregnant then. She had a history of changing the three Lords into infants and became their mother A mother's womb can bear the anger of the baby too. Hence, Lord Shiva converted his anger into an egg and transferred into Anasuya's womb - Oh! - Yeah. That egg developed into Durvasa. Durvasa is sheer anger personified. It was with him that the proverb 'Your anger is your enemy' was born. He can't ever tolerate carelessness. He always has anger on his nose and curse on the tip of his tounge. (both shaking) -I bow to you. I bow to you Don't you know that you have to introduce yourselves before bowing? P... P... Priyavadha. Priya 'Vadha'(killing)? Not Vadha Holy Guru! I'm Priyamvada. Ah! There is no place for wrong pronounciation in a hermitage. And what is your name? (shaking) Asuya. Asuya (jealousy)? No! An... Anasuya. (groans in anger) You dare pronounce my Mother's name wrong? You! (Anasuya shaking in fear) Alas! I'm pardoning you as you carry my mother's name. May you be happy. Anasuya... Anasuya! Huh? Did he curse you? No. Your name saved your day. Thank god! (mantras being chanted) (percussion and musical instruments playing) Young lady... Is Rishi Kanva here? Girl... Is Rishi Kanva here? It is Durvasa here. Didn't you notice? It's the Durvasa, the one who kept the ills at bay who is asking you. Can't you hear me? Shakunthala! (echoes) This is the great Rishi Durvasa who has Lord Shiva's presence in him. Can't you see? Damn! Attitude! How can a half-bred born to an angel and a human be cultured? Neither the respect towards a great Rishi, nor consideration of my great powers. No shame and courtesy. Here is the result of insulting me being carelessly lost in thought. Shakunthala! Being in whose thought you have insulted this sacred man The same person would forget your identity. May he lose all your memory. You have insulted a guest being lost in thought. May your lover forget you totally. (growling in anger) Pay for it! Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Anasuya! You are here! Where is Priyamvada? Didn't I tell you that King Dushyantha would arrive today? Look there! Can you hear those instruments? Are our people ready for a grand welcome at the banks of river Malini? Go and check that! A heart will not lie. It will not break a promise. King Dushyanta will never quit his righteous nature. He has left this place in the month of Chaitra. The month of Margashira is arriving. But he hasn't turned up. Whatever is the reason for the delay Following him and going through the situation is your duty as a wife. Its time to bid goodbye to this house. Start for your husband's place, my dear. Father! (Rishi Kanva sighs) Although it is custom to give birth to your child at your parent's place, We can't follow it now, my child. The dynasty should know that their heir is coming. River Malini is just pacing up. It is waiting to guide you. Start now. (Mother Gauthami): Shakunthala! Father! Your eyes are full of tears! A father of a daughter has to go through tears my dear, even if it is Rishi Kanva. I have performed countless Yagas myself. But the best Yaga of all is to bring up a daughter. The Homa's smoke is causing these tears, my child. Lighten up your husband's place with your glory. You have never stepped out of the hermitage. You don't know about the world out there. I'm taking you out for the first time. Let us start. Come child. Don't feel bad that I'm leaving you all. I'm taking your memories with me. Anyone calls you anytime, you will find me in that. Don't be gloomy in my thoughts. Behave as if I'm right here. You should make sure the hermitage doesn't miss me. Alright? (chantings) (chantings continue) Great saint! Great saint! Listen to me great saint! You say you have Lord Shiva's presence in you. Is it only his anger but not his kindness, sire? She did not notice the great Rishi's presence lost in thoughts of her lover. You gave such a dire punishment for a mistake done unintentionally? You cursed a pregnant woman! The baby in the womb has not even seen the mother yet. You are distancing the father too! Are you punishing the baby in the womb too? A Rishi's word is ultimate. Every word is strongly connected to destiny. There is an intention of god behind this, my dear. So you wouldn't take back the curse? Even Lord Shiva can't take back his word. I can tell you a cure for the curse. But... Why do you hesitate? You must not reveal it till the curse is lifted automatically. If that happens, she would never get rid of the curse. A symbol that represents their love will remind him one day. Anytime he sees a gift he gave her, he will remember her. I'll take leave. The loving gift of the emperor. Looks like the emperor himself is holding your finger. Never take this off. We are getting late. Come child. "Sway sway and sway" "The boat sails away" "Sway sway and sway" "The boat treads to far waters" "The moonlight has taken the form of a gorgeous young woman" "Oh sailor!" "The moonlight has taken the form of a gorgeous young woman" "She brings along all presents and gifts as she sets sail to reach the abode of her husband" "The beautiful dame is about to give birth" "Her husband is lucky" "He has wed this fine woman from the hermitage" "He has become her life" "Sway sway and sway" "Have you noticed it silently?" "Sway sway and sway" "Your smile carries your shyness" (chanting mantras) "An emperor who rules the country" "Would be at your service when he sees you" "He will treat you like a queen" "He will be obedient to you forever" "He will play music for you" "He will carry you on his shoulders" "He will treat you royally" "You are the form of Menaka on earth" "You are his best gift ever" "Sway sway and sway" (thunders rumbling) "The boat sails away happily" "The boat sways royally" "Is it the thoughts that sway it?" (thunders rumbling) "Let any typhoon come" "Can it douse the light of hope?" "Any anger or curse" "Can they stop the strong waves in the sea?" "Would the stream of feelings stop whatever happens?"

"Even if the river dries up into sand dunes" "You have to reach your destination" "Live to encounter a challenge everyday" "Sway sway and sway" "The boat crosses a lot of shores" "Sway sway and sway" "You've reached the place thats yours" I trusted you as a friend and made you a commander. You have cheated a farmer who feeds the nation. You have taken their signatures on blank sheets. You have occupied the farm illegally. What do you have to say about this? I was overcome by greed. Pardon me. Earth will never pardon anyone who cheats a farmer. Even as an emperor, I will have to become one with the land one day. I cannot pardon you. I expel you from my country for life! This is not just the empire of Puru. This is the farmer's empire. A ruler always wants the tiller's well being. The land which is wet with a farmer's sweat turns into a treasure. The land which is wet with a farmer's tears turns into a graveyard. From now, the tiller will own the land! I hereby give an order that even a king can't command over a farmer's land. Not just the grain that we grow, but every grain we eat will be on your name my lord! Long live emperor Dushyantha! Long live! Long live emperor Dushyantha! Long live! Hail the successor of the Puru empire! Hail! Long live emperor! People from Rishi Kanva's hermitage are here to meet you. Royal priest! Please get them here with all rituals. Welcome them royally. (Sanskrit chants) (chanting continues) (in unison) Greetings, king Dushyanta! My king, with your permission... I would like to read out the message sent to you by Kanva Maharishi. Please do. A blessing to Chandravamsha... Dearest son of queen Rathandari Devi and king Ilina... To king Dushyanta, the best among the Puru's... Blessings from Kanva Maharshi. Oh king! For protecting the holy ritual held at my hermitage in my absence... I thank you for that. Eventually you fell in love with my adopted daughter and... married her according to Gandharva rites, I agree and approve of your marriage. As a result of your love, my child who is now pregnant.. I hope that you would accept her as your wife in all formalities and glory... I surrender her to you. Young sages! Are you sure he sent this message for me? Yes, great king! It's true that I came to your ashram... It's true that I stood guard to protect your holy ritual... But who is Shakunthala? I don't know who she is... I am seeing her for the first time. Looks like she is pregnant... How can you tell me to accept her as my wife? Young sages, may be you are mistaken. Oh yes! A mistake might have happened! You have many mistresses... how can you remember Shakunthala among them? Calm down young sage, why rush to conclusions? Why are you blaming me unnecessarily? But my king, Gandharva marriage happened between you both. Shakunthala! How would the king know if you hide your face? Show him your face. Members of the court... As a sign of Shakunthala and Dushyanta's love... We have Dushyanta's royal ring gifted to her. Shakunthala, show him the ring that he gave you as a token of love. Where is it dear? Where is the ring? Oh no! You lost it in the Sachi river? (courtiers laughing) Nice story! Don't know where else she might have said the same story? It seems, she lost the ring which the king gave her as a token of love. Deceptive! Cheat! She came here only to cheat us. I don't know who she is. This is the first time I am seeing her. She doesn't even have the ring, she says I gifted to her. Why are you blaming me for this? Oh daughter of a saint who lost her virginity... You thought of becoming a queen! You live in a hermitage, you can't be greedy! She must not be spared, my king. Punish her my king, tell us what punishment you'll give. (in unison) Punish her. She should be punished. (in unison) Punish her. She should be punished. Punish her my king, she is a cheat. We were no way involved in the Gandharva marriage between you two. Things have got till here because of the decision you took independently. You must face the consequences. Our job was to drop you off till here. If you are pious, then you'll have to prove your innocence. We are leaving. Mother Gowtami! Let's go. Forgive me my dear. We might shed a few tears for you, but... We cannot share your fate. Back then your own mother abandoned you in the forests... And today your foster mother is abandoning you among these people. Your purity would save you my dear. Mother Gautami! Young saints! How can you leave without solving the issue? You are a great king who can solve any problem, right? We leave her to you whether you accept her or punish her. Minister! I don't remember a thing. She looks like a pure heart. I am confused... Give me a suggestion, minister. My king! Let's give her a chance... Any ways, as the royal priest said, you must have a heir very soon. My king! Yes indeed... Let's allow her to live in Prathishtanapuram... And if her child bares your resemblance and your features... We can consider that, may be you must have forgotten her... Or may be some evil might have possessed you. Then you can take her as your wife. Is this what you call honour of your Puru dynasty? You are born in the great Puru dynasty in which... Puru exchanges his youth for his father Yayati's old age as the later was cursed. Only to deceive me? I thought I was walking on a great land, But I never thought there would be pits covered in grass. I was deceived by your lies. Are you discussing with your courtiers? Why didn't you think about your courtiers on that day? You said you love me? You said nature is our witness, no need of elders and any one. You lied to me that Gandharva marriage is righteous by Shastras... and became the reason for the life which is growing in my womb. Did you discuss with all of them and brought me to this? And your priests, they've blessed me with a great boon, not just me... even for my unborn child? What? If he bears your resemblance and has your features, only then he is your child? So, not just me, you are giving my son a chance as well to prove that I am pious? How humane my king! First you deceived me and now you being inhumane? Because you are a woman I am listening to whatever you said. Utter one more word, you'll have to face the consequences. My king! Why are you tolerating her non sense? You even punished your best friend for deceiving you... She is trying to deceive you. Go away lady... Go away. How ever you lost your honour, at least save your life. She is a cheater, she is here to cheat you... Don't spare her my king. To make her unborn son the heir to Prathishtanapuram throne... She want's to make you a scape goat for the sin she committed. You must punish her my king. (in unison) She must be punished, she is a cheat. - She should not be spared. - She must be tortured. We must execute her in public. Unchaste woman! Cheat! She must be given harshest of the punishments. Stop! I forgive you because I respect women, go away, I spare you. You must not be seen not only by me, but also to the people of Pratishtanapuram. Go away, I spare you. (groans in pain) Mother Earth! Mother! You took back Goddess Sita who was doubted, back into your womb. Take me back as well. (Shakunthala sobbing) You hatch a plan to stain Dushyanta's fame? Go! Go and die! Or else the people of this kingdom will kill you! Menaka! Forgive me Devendra. My steps are faltering. Being helpless, I cannot do injustice to dance. Go get some rest. Menaka! Saanumathi! For name's sake this is heaven... but, can there be any other hell than this? Menaka! To disturb Vishwamitra's penance was your job... in that process you gave birth to a child. That's just part of your job but not calls for a bonding. What have we got to do with human relations? Try to spend some time with a human and have a child... You will realise what it feels like. My daughter is a mortal, she doesn't have a place in this immortal world. A celestial nymph who can't die... does not stand a chance to live in the human world. That is why I abandoned my child to face these hardships. Though I gave her birth, I couldn't be her mother. Saanumathi! A mother's labour pains just last only for a day or so... But a mother who abandoned her child will have to live in pain for ever. Mother Earth! I handed over my daughter to you. She is fighting to save her marriage. You are her only saviour... Please protect her. She's the one who got kicked out of the court. Yeah! The king married her it seems. Such a cheat! She came as a bride carrying a child in her womb. Go away woman... Go away. Shame on you. It's okay to kill a woman like her. Hit her... Hit her... Hit her. Don't you know who impregnated you or don't you remember how many? Are you a virtuous woman or a prostitute? Unholy woman shouldn't become a mother. If she gives birth, there would be drought. Killing her is also a good deed... Kill her... Kill her... (Shakunthala groans) The fish are biting off the nets these days. Look, that unholy woman has reached till here. - She is still alive. - You dare to accuse our righteous king? She shouldn't be left alive. Let's kill her and her unborn child then throw them in the river, come on guys. Let's go, hurry up. Get it fast. - Hey, bring the basket. - Coming. - Hey, pull the nets. - Okay... Okay. A pregnant fish! Hey Seelavathi! Seelavathi! Seelavathi! Where the hell is he? Hey Peetha Raju, I caught a Seelavathi fish. - What did you say? - Not talking to you... A fish! I caught Seelavathi fish. Don't try to flirt with me... I'll clean you up like a dead fish, you fool. - Hell with you! - Damn you! As soon as I woke up, my neighbour sneezed... I was worried as to what would happen. But this Kumbhilaka caught a Seelavathi fish. May be today is my lucky day. Hey Seelavathi, I won't sell you... I will clean you up, chop you to pieces, cook you up... will store you in a clay pot and have for four days. Hail Seelavathi! Here we go. Huh? - Catch me if you can. - Wait dude, I will catch you. - Greetings sir. - Hmm! That's my grandpa's ring. Once my grandpa went out for hunting... - his boat sank in the middle of the sea. - Is it! While he was swimming back to the shore, a giant crab charged at him. A giant crab and my grandpa... My grandpa and the crab... A huge fight broke out between them. The crab died and became a Goddess. Is it! She became a crab because Indra cursed her. And she became a Goddess again after my grandpa killed her. Oh! Hmm! Then she said, 'Veeraih! You freed me off my curse...' 'so take this ring as a gift.' - Is this your grandpa's ring? - Yes, he is a hero. Then whose name is engraved on it? Uh! Is it the name of a man or a woman? - A man's name. - So it must be his name. - So your grandpa is king Dushyanta? - Yes, sir. - Oh no! Kings name? I am innocent. - Stop right there. - I can't read, let me go. - Where you are going? - Soldiers, come here. - I am innocent. - (both) Let's go. - I am innocent. My King! He is the traitor who stole your ring... He was caught in the market while trying to sell it. He stole my ring? My King! I am a fisher man and fishing is my livelihood... I am not a thief my lord. While cutting the fish which I caught to make curry, I found the ring in its belly. If I was a literate I would have read the name on it, Right away I would've come to you to surrender it. My King! I swear, I am not a thief. My ring was found in a fish's belly? Quite surprising! Bring it to me. "In the great Himalayas, in the hermitage adjacent to river Malini" "I saw an eternal beauty and am stupefied by her magical charm" "Who is this blooming young girl? Who is this stealer of hearts?" "Who is this frost bud? Who could this shining star be?" "Is she a heavenly damsel?" But Angels don't wink their eyes! "Is she a forest beauty? But she isn't wearing jute fabric!" You are the reason for the life which is growing in my womb. Utter one more word, the consequences would be severe. "But a golden statue can't walk!" - "Who is this blooming young girl?" - Go away, I spare you. "Who is this stealer of hearts?" "Who is this divine beauty?" Shakunthala! What is this oblivion? I did not recognise my Shakunthala. I gave up on love of my life. I committed a grave sin. Gentlemen of my court! Forgive me. The innocent woman who came for me back then... she is my wife. The empress of this great empire. I married her, she is my beloved wife. She is my Shakunthala. We wed by the Gandharva tradition in the hermitage of Kanva Maharshi. The Kaalanemi demons were defeated by me while I was guarding a holy ritual. Later they invaded our kingdom seeking revenge. After the war, I thought of welcoming Shakunthala in a grand royal ceremony. But the war lasted for long. In the meantime some evil has possessed me... I insulted her though she was carrying my heir in her womb. - Sir, you are not illiterate... - My King! You were destined to remind me of my past. No matter what I give, I am still indebted to you. Give him tons of wealth and bid him a grand farewell. My King! Soldiers! Search in every direction. Bow down to the empress of Paurava. Give Shakunthala Devi a grand welcome. - Madavya! - Yes, my friend! - Minister! - My King! Halt every royal duty until I find Shakunthala. Go... Take the entire army. Find me my Shakunthala. (indistinct chatter) "Oh sweet past..." "Don't freeze the time" "Why did you stop without ticking?" "My royal ring..." "Without showing any mercy..." "Why did you slip away?" "Like the dawn after the dark..." "Like the awakening after the sleep" "My hope on you keeps me going" "The chirp of Shakunthala bird which plays in silence" "Oh sweet past..." "Don't freeze the time" "Why did you stop without ticking?" "My love!" "I'll be with you..." "always like your shadow" "Would the stars ever leave the moon?" "Did the evening magic cast a spell on me?" "A memoir might be lost, but would the memories be?" "Though I found memories, would I find the beauty herself?" "Rather than coming in front of me..." "How long are these testing times?" "Enough of these tears" "Oh sweet past..." "Don't freeze the time" "Why did you stop without ticking?" "Being away is better..." "it makes you to love even more" "Pain is endless..." "Is this because I am at fault?" "On the path of love, shall I be your story and walk along with you?" "With out you, how would my journey last?" "Our union..." "May time freeze it" "Can it stop the love?" The throne which couldn't do justice to a woman... - not just four years... - Friend! Even after any unkown years... I won't claim back the throne. (bee buzzing) Shakunthala! That bumble bee is trying to touch you... I won't let it defile you. I am there to protect you. I will save you. (bee buzzing continuously) Stop you bee! My friend! This is your illusion. That's just her portrait. Shakunthala is not here. Huh! You wicked man! You proved it as an illusion. Go... Go away. You must not dare show your faces to me. Go away from here. Menaka! I've been watching him as you suggested. We are the goddesses who never had a teary eye. I have realised the value of tears in the human world. Joy and pain are in love with each other down there. They can't exist without each other. With out Shakunthala, even breathing would be fatal for Dushyanta. He might breath his last any minute. Menaka! Devendra! There would be a reason behind the pain given by the God. Don't be sad. This is the move made by the Kaalanemi demons. If the clash between the Gods and demons took place... They are well aware that my friend Dushyanta would stand on my side. Along with the emperor who got weakened because of Shakunthala... Their strategy is to conquer over the God's world too. But there is nothing to worry... Shakunthala's piousness has turned to Dushyanta's strength. No one can defeat it. Why are those Kalanemis filled with hatred? Is it because the king protected the holy ritual performed by the maharishis? Not just that... In that process Dushyanta married Shakunthala and became their enemy. They knew very well that the emperor would declare... Shakunthala as the empress of Prathishtanapura. Curse of Durvasa on top of that... became a boon to those wicked demons. Shakunthala is as good as dead to Dushyanta as he doesn't remember her. True! In that process Dushyanta had to insult her in the court. - The heir would turn to ashes in her womb. - True! That womb itself would become the grave of Chandravamsham. But, though they had a chance to kill Shakunthala that day... in the rage that they've let her live out of their foolishness... Ugranemi, the leader of demons executed his blood brothers. (indistinct chatter) Why so much grudge on Shakunthala and Dushyanta? Actual grudge is not on them either. But it's on the child who would be born to that couple. Grudge on an innocent child who is not born yet? Their unborn child would be the creator of a new world order. The righteous one raised by Shakunthala who was afflicted by iniquity herself. Soon the demonic world would end. In Kaliyuga the human body would become the adobe of the demons. According to a Rishi, The demon king would die at the hands of a greatest man among humans. And there is no one greater than Dushyanta himself. Not just to mark Ugranemi's end... This war is inevitable in order to find Shakunthala. My friend! Oh no... what's this magic? - (man laughing) - Why am I hanging in the air? Who the hell are you?-Your doom, you fool. My friend, save me.-You must die today... Until then you must keep hanging in the air. Even your best friend cannot save you today. What happened? My friend, save me. - This king less Paurava kingdom... - Show up if you have the guts. - Will become a pile of corpses... - Where are you? Not able to make out where he is.-this is inevitable. Oh no... Ouch! My turban... my turban. Oh God! Ouch! Shakunthala! Oh Dushyanta, husband of Shakunthala! Oh Dushyanta, husband of Shakunthala! Save me... Save me Dushyanta. Here he comes again. - No one will come to your rescue. - Who are you? Leave me. No one can save you from me. I said let me go. - You illusory! - Hey! Enough of your demonic acts in front of me. Your life ends today. - Ouch! - King! Stop my king... - Stop king Dushyanta. - Ouch! Calm down my king, calm down. The charioteer of Lord Indra? Mathali? What's all this? Forgive me my king... Kalanemi clan is all set to invade Amarapuri. You almost killed me man. The war between God's and demons has become inevitable because of Ugranemi. I came to seek your help on behalf of my master. You were depressed, so I had to pull off this feet to prep for the upcoming war. This is my duty as a friend and nothing else. Amareshwara (God Indra) has pleaded you to set off to Amaravathi at once. Mr. God! Do you call this pleading in your world? I had a close shave with my death. Ouch! You call this pleading? Only you can finish off those Kaalanemis. After four years, now I've found a way to find my Shakunthala. I will kill that sinner who hatched a plot to miss each other... and wash off my sins. Ugranemi! Beware, I am coming for you. (commotion) (commotion continues) Please don't kill me. Shakunthala is safe in the Kashyapa valleys. Those mystical... We were not able to gain access into the mystical Himalayas... So we couldn't harm her. Being the reason for our separation for these may years... you don't deserve to live. All hail Dushyanta the great. (all hailing Dushyanta) Hail the king of all Gods. (all hailing God Indra) (Lion growling) (Lion continues to growl) My King! I will go and seek permission to meet Mr. Prajapathi. Devadutta! (Lion growling) Who are you? I never saw you around. What's your name father (child)? What's, your name my son? What? Am I your son? If I am your father, then obviously you are my son. Aright! Consider me your son. Keep away from me. First tell me, why did you shoot an arrow at my friend Devadutta? As I don't know about your friendship... I misunderstood that you were in danger. I am a king, so saving your life is my duty, right? Because you thought it could kill me, will you kill it? If killing someone is wrong, what you did is also wrong. Killing other animals and eating meat to live is their God-given characteristic. And saving every other form of life... it's a duty bestowed upon you by the throne. It means that... you have to save me as well as the lion. That is the law. Well said, a new way of life. Who are your parents, my child? What purpose do you have with them? Your words are filled with royalty. You are not a monks child. I am curious to know, which royal family you belong to. Whatever, but I am sure I belong to a better family than you. What? Say your name and seek forgiveness from my Devadutta. It's wrong to speak like that son, you are just a kid... you won't understand the duties of the elders, go and play. Hey! Stop right there. Because I am a kid are you trying to belittle me? Dhruva, who pleased Lord Vishnu and became a star in the sky... how old is he? Markandeya, who called down Lord Shiva to earth and won over Yama... how old is he? Prahlada, who showed Lord Narsimha to his father who was blinded with pride... how old is he? You know many puranas... but don't you know how to behave with someone who's like your father? What... You are like a father to me? Come on, ask me for my forgiveness. Ah! What if I don't? You have to fight with me. If things worked out well for me, I would've had a son your age. Your parents are lucky to have you as their son. May you live long! Sarvadamana! (both women) Sarvadamana! Hey King! Stop... stop. I told you to raise your weapon, but you bless me instead? Are you scared? - Then come, fight me. - There he is... Sarvadamana! Sarvadamana! It's wrong. Sarvadamana! He is a guest at our hermitage. You must not misbehave with the guests. So what, he must enjoy our hospitality... but how can he try to kill my best friend? Dear guest! I am not a killer like you... I am not unlawful. I am the dearest disciple of Kashyapa Prajapathi. In our war I will protect you with my life... With out hurting you I will win over you, come on, raise your sword. Oh no! Where is your amulet? Kashyapa tied it on you to protect you from evil. What have you done Sarvadamana? Here it is, he might have lost it while playing with the lion, tie it back. If someone else touches it, it would turn into a snake and strike at you. Only his parents can touch it. But nothing happened to you, which means... (both) You must be... Sarvadamana! Sarvadamana! But who is Shakunthala? I don't know this woman, I am seeing her for the first time. Mother... Mother! Mother! That stranger shot an arrow at my Devadutta. Upon asking why, he said he did it to save me, he says. What if something happened to Devadutta? But nothing happened, right? Misunderstanding should also be understood. One who punishes is not a hero... One who forgives is the real hero. Shakunthala! Shakunthala! I forgive you because I respect women, go away, I spare you. Shakunthala! Here I am, I came searching for you and our son. Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Listen to me Shakunthala... Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Mother, who is that guy? - Shakunthala! - Who is that king? Shakunthala! Hear me out. Woman like her should not live on the earth neither should she give birth. Kill her! Kill her! Miserable woman! Die. She is carrying a illegitimate child in her womb... if she gives birth it would bring misfortune, it's ominous. Kill her! Kill her! (sobbing) (continues to sob) (tiger growling) (tiger continues to growl) (Shakunthala screaming) (infant crying) An orphan is born to an orphan. Hey! It's getting dark, prepare the carts. (infant crying) (Shakunthala groaning) (infant crying) (infant crying) (Shakunthala panting) Kashyapa Prajapathi! Not just demons and the Gods, you're a fatherly figure to every living thing. Am I not your daughter? May you live long! Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Please wait! Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Hear me out. Just give me one minute. Shakunthala! Listen to me. Shakunthala! Shakunthala! I insulted you in your court... Your kingdom doubted you. Shakunthala! I committed a grave sin. Shakunthala! But I did not lie... Some evil possessed me. Shakunthala! Please try to understand me. I could not understand the truth. Shakunthala! I got lost in myself, I forgot my precious you. Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Look here, my conscience that you wanted to invoke made me a better man again. I will hold your hand and stand in front of every door... I will announce to everyone that you are my wife. I would plead that no woman should endure what you have till now. I will make women empowerment a statute and then behead myself. Shakunthala! Accept me, have mercy on me. Give me a chance to atone my sins. Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Shakunthala! Give me one last chance. Dear Shakunthala! - Greetings, Kashyapa Prajapathi! - God bless you. May be illusion could make you forget love... But no power could make you forget ones self-esteem and insults hurled at them. Dear, your love for him made him forget his love. Lost in thoughts, you didn't even notice the arrival of the great saint Durvasa. Then how would you know that he cursed you. - A curse? - Shakunthala! Being in whose thoughts you have insulted this great man... Let your form fade away in his mind. Let your memories get erased in his mind. For insulting a guest... let your beloved man forget you. Face the consequences. Like your forgotten love... Your tale will go remain in history as an unforgettable love story. Forgive me my love. Hope that you would forgive me as well. My son! He is your father... King Dushyanta. Father! You're a great wife who has showed the greatness of love, trust in marriage... and even the affection of a mother to this world. Your son would become a great man who would change the course of this world. You were born to give birth to him. You've endured all these hardships to make this child a great warrior. As they say, first teacher is the mother, right? To teach, you have to learn first. In modern civilization... who will build the modern India (Bharath) which will be the epitome for ever... your son will be the great Bharatha. Here after, this Aarsha continent will become prominent day by day. Like I disowned her back then... If my daughter Shakunthala left her son in the forest too... A great world would have ended before it was formed. I gave birth to a great daughter... who taught motherhood to her own mother. Hail king Dushyanta, the greatest in Chandravamsha family! (all) Hail! Hail king Dushyanta the best in the Puru empire! (all) Hail! All hail Dushyanta, the son of great king Ilina! (all) Hail! Hail king Dushyanta the slayer of the demons! (all) Hail! Hail king Dushyanta, the greatest in Chandravamsha family! (all) Hail! Hail king Dushyanta the best in the Puru empire! (all) Hail! All members of the court... I give you Shakunthala Devi, the queen of the Paurava empire. - Hail queen Shakunthala Devi! - (all) Hail! Like my son, I consider everyone in Puru empire as my child from now on. I am glad to have the opportunity to serve you as a mother... along with your father emperor Dushyanta (all hailing queen Shakunthala) On this auspicious occasion... The future king of Bharath... I announce my son as the crowned prince. (priests chanting Sanskrit mantras) God bless you! God bless you! As Bharatha... I swear that I would work for your progress.
