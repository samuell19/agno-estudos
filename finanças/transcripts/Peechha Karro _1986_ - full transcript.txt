I had told you to bring the breakfast at 8:44.. ..then why have you brought it at 8:45? Tell me. Brigadier, why are you shouting? If you shout so much, you will get a heart attack. Then how will you be able to eat all this? - Yes. And yes, did you eat that? - What? What did you say? That pulp-bulb? The garlic pulse. - Yes, you are eating it. No, it is over. Finished. It's finished. - I see. Check the pocket. - Okay. Not yours, mine. Which one? - The closest one. Yes, this one. What is this? Garlic pulse? My garlic pulse? Thief. You stole it? You are too much.

I am in a hurry today and I'm getting late for college. College? But today is Sunday, how can you go to college? Actually, Daddy, I have tuition classes today. Tuition classes? Are you taking tuitions or someone is giving you? You are too much, Daddy. My exams are nearing and I've to go. Bye, Daddy. Dear, listen. Introduce me to your tuition teacher.. ..after your exams. Yes, Daddy. I'll introduce you to him. Right. Whose daughter is she? Inspector. - Yes. The brigadier has come. Really? What is he wearing? A mini skirt. - Mini skirt? Idiot, he is not the brigadier, but his daughter Roma. Roma? Then let me follow her alone. Stupid, we have to follow the brigadier. Hello? The cat salutes the dog. Tell me, boss no. 2, what's your order? Reach Hotel Sheesh Mahal at sharp 10:00 today with the documents. But what about the money? Sell the stuff with this hand and take the amount with the other. Okay, boss. I'll come right now. Take care. No one should follow you. Follow me? Don't laugh. - Sorry, boss. I'll come right now. Come on, hurry up. Hey? He has run away. Taxi. - Taxi. Hey, taxi.

No one has died today since morning. Mr. Kandharam. - What is it? Take it back. - Take it back? Why? That man is still alive. He is still alive? How? He had not died. He was practicing yoga. Practicing yoga? What is this? A joke? He has made me suffer a loss. Look, it is the rule of my business. I don't take back the stuff once I sell it. It is fine, Kandharam. But should we do about this stuff now? Yes. It is right. You shouldn't be in a loss and I shouldn't benefit either. Rastogilal. - Yes? Your wife was sick, right? How is she now? What should I tell you, Kandharam? There is a desire till she is breathing. - Yes. There are no hopes. It is possible that she may die tomorrow or today. She may die right now. There is no guarantee, Brother. There is no guarantee. Mr. Rastogilal. - Yes? Buy this stuff. Perhaps it may be useful for your wife. - Yes. This stuff? It will be useful for you. For your wife. You die. Oh, my God. - May your wife die. Why should my wife die? Get lost. They didn't die either. Vijay. - Yes, Father? Where are you going all dressed up? It is time for us to sit at the shop. Father, I won't handle this business. Then will your father sit here? That's what I'm saying, Daddy. That father will sit here. The son won't. Is this a business? To sell the funeral items? If you wanted me to do this, why did you educate me.. ..and made me an engineer? Cheer up, Son. This business has brought color to your cheeks.. ..and you are abusing it? This business can never die and death is the life of this business. Lord Krishna had told Arjun ..about life in 'Ramayana'. That life is a pleasant journey where no one knows.. ..what will happen tomorrow. You know it. Who else? Come on, give me Rs. 30. Son, what do you know how much your father loves you? But you don't care for me. Dance, my darling, you will get money. Where will you find such an adorer? Who has said it? The disciples had said this to Meneka. Well said. He is my father. Thief. Thief. Thief. Someone catch him. That thief is running away with my purse. Why are you shaking your hands in panic? Vijay, the thief has run away with my purse. He has run away with your purse? - Yes. Which purse? - The white one. The white one? Which I had given you? Which daddy had given me. - How was it? Just like this. Vijay, it is my purse. Listen, friend, her daddy had gifted it to her. Please return it to her. Hey? Don't you understand Hindi? Stop. Wait. Constable. - Yes? The thief has snatched my purse. He stole your purse? - Yes. I'll catch him. - Here. This way. This way? Wretched thief. - Yes. Come on, give me the purse. Give me the purse. Wretched thief. Lower the dagger. Lower the dagger. - It's not mine. It's not mine. The purse is in your hand. - I didn't steal it. I didn't steal it. Come to the police station. - Then let's go to the police station. Why are you threatening me? - Leave me. Am I a thief? Come on, walk ahead. Go ahead. Come on, hurry up. Sir. Sir, I've caught the thief. I've caught the thief. Are you crazy? I'm explaining to you since a while that I'm not a thief. Firstly, you steal and on the top of it, you are threatening me? You have the purse in your hand, don't you? Oh, this purse? First the thief had stolen it. Then the other thief snatched it from him. Then I snatched it from him. Then? You didn't snatch it, you stole it. It means you are thief no. 3. I didn't steal it. It is my purse. It is a ladies purse. - Yes. Now you will say the lady is yours, too. She is definitely mine. He is such a flirt, sir. He says Mary, the purse and the lady belongs to him, too. Do you understand him? - I don't understand anything. I don't understand it either. Snatch away his dagger. I'll put him behind bars. Wait. Wait. Why are you putting him behind bars? He is not a thief. He is my fianc?. Did you hear? I am her fianc?. And this purse belongs to me. - Yes. If it is your purse, then why did he steal it? And he also has a dagger in his hand. Look, I'll tell you what happened. I was standing there. The thief came and ran away with my purse. Then the other thief came and stood beside me. Then Vijay came and he ran away, too. I didn't run. I was chasing the thief to get your purse. Yes. First the thief ran away. Then Vijay ran away. Then the constable ran away as well. Why are you creating the dilemma of running away? As it is, he couldn't understand anything. - Vijay, keep quiet. I am explaining to him since a while. He is hell bent on putting me behind bars. - Please, Vijay. Shut up. Is she your lady? - Yes. Lady, is it your purse? - Yes, it is mine. Now get out. - Go. Thank you very much. - Go. Take the dagger. - Keep it down. Come on, let's go. If you see their faces in the morning.. ..your entire day is spoiled. Oh, a ghost. Constable. Constable. - What's wrong? There is a ghost on the tree. There is a ghost? My duty is not on this road.. ..I am appointed on that road. Please come. Come and check what's wrong. What? - Yes. I had warned you not to put a flower on the tree. But I had put it up for decoration. Decoration? A rose flower on a sacred fig tree? Idiot. Oh, sorry. The constable is coming this way. Please come. - Where? The ghost was here. Here? - Yes. Oh, where is it? You adorn it. - Should I? No ghost. Go. - Thank you. It's fine. She was saying that there is a ghost here. Oh, my God. A ghost. The cat salutes the dog. The cat salutes the dog. Come to Rockan Road exactly at 10:00 am today. Yes, I've understood. But what about the butter and cream? You will get everything. Bring the bread. Shut up. - Sorry. I will come just now. Inspector, the enemy is escaping. - Really? Come on, follow him. - Follow him. Hurry up. Taxi. - Taxi. Taxi. - Taxi. Hey, taxi driver. - Taxi. Driver, follow that car. - Driver, follow him. All right, sir. - Follow him. Oh, my God. Ghost. Ghost. Hey, what are you doing? - Oh, God. Ghost. Ghost. Driver, don't go. Driver, don't go. - Ghost. The cat salutes the dog. The dog salutes the cat. The map? - I've brought it. Check it. Excellent. But it is the question of satisfying my hunger. Eat the bread. Count it. I trust you. No. - Yes. Inspector Giri Haridhara. Yes, Inspector Hari Haridhara. It is very shameful for us. We are following that brigadier since three months.. .. but we have been unable to catch him yet. Yes. But, Inspector Hari Haridhara, what proof do we have.. ..that this brigadier is selling the secrets of our country.. ..to the enemy countries? We will get the evidence if we're able to catch him red-handed. But he is giving us the slip since three months. Why shouldn't we enter his bungalow and catch him? Idiot, first we want the evidence. Secondly, we can't go before him. He knows us. He recognizes us. If we go before him, then everything will be ruined. All our efforts will go waste. Oh, then what should we do? Then what? I've thought of a new idea for it. - What? We'll follow his daughter. It is possible that we may get some clues from her. Yes. Good idea. - Thank you. Show me the slides. - Yes. Sri Devi? - No. Radha? - No. She is Roma. "You come and leave with a chime, giving me a glimpse." "You come and leave with a chime, giving me a glimpse." "I am thirsty. You are a cloud."

You are lying on the carpet, with a rose flower in your hand.. ..and humming a song, it proves that you are in love. No, Daddy. It is not so. It is so. Who is he? What is his name? Tell me. Why are you panicking? When I had fallen in love with your mother.. Well. Forget it. Who is he? What is his name? Vijay. - Where is he? Tell me? I want to meet him. Okay, Daddy. I'll introduce him to you. Soon. - Yes. "Darling, I'll get out of your way." "I go under a train.." Spit. Spit. Why? What's your problem? Mosquito bite? I can do this dance, too. I've seen it twelve times. 'Enter The Dragon'. Get it? We had been ordered to attack right at 6:30. Alpha Bravo Charlie 1. Order. Attack. Attack. We heard the sound of fire from the front. We fired with our machine guns. After that, I saw the air-force. The aero-planes were landing. After that, I saw a man sitting in front. I picked up my gun, aimed it at him and fired. Oh, my God. Hey, what's wrong? Sir, I think China has attacked again. - Oh, China? I think my Kung-fu master has come. Kung-fu? - Yes. Come. Come. Help. - Hey? Yes, come. How are you? - Fine. Go and bring milk for sir. Yes, serve him milk. My tooth is broken and I should serve him milk, too. He will thrash me more after drinking the milk. He is Bruce Lee's far-off relative. Chus Lee. Who? - Yes, Chus Lee. Chus Lee. It's fine. Have milk. But, Daddy, why have you called him here? I've called him here because he is the most dangerous.. ..Kung-fu master of this city. Understood? I want to show him that my son-in-law is no less. You call Vijay here tomorrow itself. And tell him to fight with this demon. He should change Chus Lee to Moos-Lee. - Okay. Then I'll see whether my son-in-law is worthy or worthless. Yes, Daddy. Roma, why don't you tell me frankly that your daddy.. ..wants me to die? He wants to kill me. You had told me yesterday that you can give up your life for me. You can get the stars from the sky. A man talks lot of nonsense in love. Is all of it true? Can anyone get the stars from the sky? It means your love is fake. You are too much. I can love you only if I am alive. And that Kung-fu master will kill me. Just make one attempt, Vijay. Defeat him just once. This means you want to kill me, too. No, Vijay, I want to marry you. Why me? Marry that wretched Kung-fu master after I die. Oh, come on, Vijay. What not people do in love and you can't do this much for me? You are under the oath of my love. It is impossible. It is impossible. I can't fight with him. You will fight. You will definitely fight. You will not only fight, but defeat him, too. How will I defeat him? Is it so easy? How will I defeat him? - Listen, I'll tell you. Look, if anything goes wrong, I'll definitely die. It is my work to placate Navratan. Come on. Oh God! Inspector Giri Haridhara. Yes, Inspector Hari Haridhara. Did you understand anything? - Of course. It means we will have to play some new drama. And the name of that drama will be blackmail. I see. You mean the black market. - Yes. Hey, the constable. Hey? There is a ghost here, too. Run. I can't find the sugar jar. Have you seen it anywhere? She sells really stale fish. She sells really stale fish. I have scolded her a lot. I scolded her so much that I burst into tears, too. But why are you so panicky? I didn't see anything. What are you saying? You didn't see anything? Yes, I didn't see anything. You didn't see anything? - Yes, I didn't see anything. Good. I am saved. - Yes. Okay, Navratan. - Yes? You will have to do a favor for me. Will you do it? - No. What? - I'll do it. Listen.. - What are you saying? You are saying it, but I'll have to do it. If brigadier sir comes to know, he will fire me. If daddy had seen the fish you were frying just now.. ..he would have shot you. But he had not seen it. Navratan, I have seen everything. What are you saying? Look, please save my life. I won't leave your feet. Navratan. - I won't leave them. What about my work? Your work will be done, but I won't leave your feet. Okay, leave my feet. - No, I won't leave them. Okay, don't leave them. - I won't. The more tax you pay, he lesser water supply you get.

I'll tell sir and get you fired. - Hey, you.. Vijay, it's him. Yes, he is here. I am saying the same. But he is not calling your daddy. Vijay, he is daddy. - Daddy? Oh, Daddy. Daddy. Daddy, please forgive me. I am sorry. I didn't recognize you. I am sorry. I am sorry. Daddy, he is Vijay. - Vijay, he is my daddy. Hello. - Hello. I think you master the art of Kung-fu karate.

I'll bring it right away. Vijay, he is Chus Lee, son of Guth Lee. And he is Vijay. Yes, he is saying that he will kill you. Yes. Navratan, come quickly. Will you start the competition now or later? After drinking the milk. - Oh, after drinking the milk. The fun will begin now. Navratan is making your arrangements. Now I'll come to know whether your choice is worthy or worthless. Navratan, hurry up. The competition has to begin. Why are you falling? You have to drink it. Hey, idiot. Your milk will be brought just now. Drink it properly. After that, I'll thrash you. Do you know Hindi? Good. I'll make mincemeat of you. I'll make cutlets of you. Come here. Give it to him quickly. Give him the milk. What will happen to you after you are thrashed up? Take it, Brother. Give it to him. Done? Come on. Oh, my God. I think he forgot. I think father will take my measurement. From where have you come? Oh, my God. What are you doing? So he knows Kung-fu? He knows Karate? Hey, Brother, stop. Brother, Indians and Chinese are brothers. Time, please. Time, please. It really hurts. It really hurts. What's wrong with him? Don't kick me. Don't kick me.

And this. Take some more. Take some more. Wretched guy, I'll show you. Come on, Vijay. Roma. Roma, live long. Well done, Vijay. May your daddy live long, too. Navratan, live long as well. Me, too.. Be careful. Cheers to me, too. Well done. Come, Son. Son, you are really made of iron. - Yes. I accept you. Come and hug me, Son. My son. Vijay, daddy is not here, but there. - Come, Son. Come.

There is no Roma. Son, you are fooling me? Listen. Go and tell her father to come home.. ..and talk about your marriage with me. I am the boy's father after all, not a vest seller. You are the boy's father, but he resides in a royal palace. Will he come to this place where funeral items are sold.. ..and the people roam half clad? He will never come. Don't come. I will go there. I don't care for my respect. I do care for it. I will give him respect. I am the girl's father. I'll have to go to him. What if I am rich? But, Daddy, his father doesn't stay here.

You are too much. You talk whatever comes to your mind. Then what else I would have done? - What you would have done? If your daddy comes to know that my father sells.. ..funeral items wearing undergarments.. ..at shop no. 3 in Dongri, then he will shoot our entire family. I don't know anything. I said what I had to. Now you will have to do some drama. - I'll have to do a drama? If I was supposed to do a drama, you should have.. ..informed me before hand about what you are going to do. At least you should have called up and consulted me. Do you find it so difficult to make a call? Inspector Hari Haridhara. - Yes, sir? Let's go. Okay? Idiot. Vijay, daddy must be coming. - So soon? Vijay, why are you so nervous? Sit proudly. You are the boy's father. Can a goat sit proudly in a lion's cage? What nonsense are you talking early in the morning? I'm going to call daddy. Why are you leaving me alone? Vijay, will it look good if I'm sitting here with you? I'll send chilled sherbet for you. Look, don't be nervous. I am going. Send the sherbet quickly.

I feel like visiting the bathroom on seeing your gun. You are fleeing? - Yes, I am fleeing, Brother. I knew you will run away. - Really? Where are you going? - I'm going home. Vijay, what's wrong? Roma, if I knew that your father roams around with such a big gun.. ..I'd have never fallen in love with you. Please forgive me. I am sorry. What are you doing? What a strange man you are!

They will turn white in the future. - I see. I see. And he loves me very much. - Really? He doesn't drink milk till I don't tell him a story. - I see. But why are you crying?

Yes, bodyguard. - Your English is good. Yes. - But your house is very small. Yes. - Well.. Well, forget it now. Forget Rehana's child. - All right. You just tell me, how do you like my daughter.. .. in the form of your daughter-in-law? Your daughter is a top item. - What? I mean she is a very decent and beautiful girl. - Yes. And I'm doing all this for her sake. - Yes. I wanted to ask you.. - Yes? You know that she is my only daughter. - Yes. I really love her. - Very good. I can't separate her from myself. - Oh, I see. So will your son live with me as my son-in-law? He will definitely stay. He will definitely stay here. Though your house is very small, he will surely stay here. In fact, I would have stayed here as your live-in brother-in-law as well.. .. but Rehana's child doesn't drink milk.. ..without hearing a story from me. - Yes. But you will attend the wedding, won't you? Of course. I'll definitely attend it. I'll definitely come. And he'll come, too. My son.. what is his name? - Vijay. Vijay. Yes, he will come, too. So shall I consider the alliance fixed? Yes. Definitely. It is definitely fixed. Wear your cap now. Okay. All right. By the way, your house is very small. How do I look?

Daughter-in-law. Daughter-in-law, please give me the towel. Daughter-in-law? Who are you? I am your would-be brother-in-law. Vijay's father. Vijay's father? Vijay's father is sitting before me.. ..so where did the other father come from? I have come from the shop. Look, this is the result of living in a small house. Anyone barges in unclad. What do you mean by unclad? I had worn my clothes, but they came off on the way. Who is he? - He.. I am Vijay's father. - He is Vijay's father. Vijay's father? Then whose father am I? You must know it. I'll tell you who you are. - Yes. You have come from the asylum. You are mad. I am mad? - Yes. You are mad. Your father is mad. Your family is mad. Shall I shoot you? Please sit. Let's talk about dowry. Please sit. Now a man in his underwear will talk with you about dowry? I am going. Wait, you don't go. - Thanks. You may go. I won't go. You won't go? - No. Then I'll shoot you. I'll see you.. I won't let this wedding take place. How you won't let it take place? I will cancel it. - I'll shoot you. I will never let it happen. I won't let it happen. I am sorry. Wonder what type of people enter my house. That underwear with a lining.. I won't let this wedding take place. - Out. I will see you. - Hey, my towel. I won't let this wedding take place. I will cancel this wedding. If you are a brigadier, I know the fire brigade, too. I'll call them and wash you away. This is my towel. I'll wash the towel, too. What do you think of me? I will go to the washerman. Hello. Excellent. Who are you? - Quiet. What is going on? - Yes. Ready. Leave my hands. One more, please. What is this joke? Who are you two? Your father. What do you mean? When you can become your father.. So can't we become your father? Come with us quietly. Where are you taking me? Come with us quietly. Otherwise we'll even remove your clothes like.. ..this beard and moustache. No, no, not my clothes. Where are you taking me? Your would-be father-in-law is a big cheat and a traitor. Do you know this? Do you know this? - Yes. Then why are you asking me? To increase your general knowledge. We also know that you have just met your.. ..would-be father-in-law in disguise of your own father. You know this. You know that. You know everything. You have a lot of information. - Yes. Then there is no problem. - Yes. Goodbye. I am going. - Bye. Sit down. Sit down. We know everything, but perhaps you don't know.. ..that your photographs which we have clicked.. .. if we send them to brigadier.. ..he will think of you as a fraud and shoot you. But you both won't give those photographs to the brigadier. You are decent men. Why would you do this? You will never do this. - Yes. You can stop us if you want. I really want you to stop. But what do you want in return of it? Inspector. - We are the secret CBI officers. We can't catch him red-handed, so we want you to do this for us. Why me? Because you are going to become his son-in-law soon. Live-in son-in-law. Live-in son-in-law? No. No. - Yes. Yes. Yes, a live-in son-in-law. No one will ever doubt you. And you'll be able to follow him easily. You can find out where the brigadier goes.. ..whom he meets, what he does.. I beg of you. I can't do this work. I can never do this. You will definitely do this. Otherwise these photographs.. - No, no. Don't post these photographs, for God's sake. Please don't post them. I'll do as you say. I'll definitely do that.. How will I do it? If my real father comes to know about this entire matter.. .. neither can I become the brigadier's son-in-law.. ..nor your secret scheme will succeed. The entire plan will flop. Finished. It is not a joke. Don't worry about it. We will take care of your father. Hail God. What's happening? There is no news of anyone's death in the newspaper. What will happen to the population of this country? Everyone you see is going on being alive. No one dies at all. Hello, Mr. Kandharam. Congratulations. Congratulations? About what? You have become the brother-in-law of such a rich man.. ..and you are asking me instead? What are you saying, Rastogi? Have you gone crazy? Crazy? Am I crazy? I find you crazy. Your son is getting married there.. ..and here you've opened your shop selling funeral items? Vijay's wedding? Yes. Look at the wedding card. Am I lying to you? It is clearly written in it that your son Vijay's wedding.. ..is being solemnized with brigadier's daughter Roma.. ..at Hotel Parklane. I am going there. Don't call me Kandharam if I don't ruin this wedding party. Inspector Giri Haridhara. Yes, Inspector Hari Haridhara. He has come to know about the wedding. Yes. Our entire plan can flop. - Yes. Hey? What's up? What happened? Hey, is it Dara Singh's gymnasium? How much for this bamboo? The shop is closed today. We don't want the shop, but the bamboo. Will you go or shall I thrash you? Get lost. Run! What will we do now? Come on. - Lock it. Now let's see where he runs. - Quiet. Didn't you hear that the shop is closed today? Quite. Quiet. - Quiet. They are mad. Idiot. Vijay and Roma. This wedding won't take place. Hello. Country first. Oh, he has started doing the 'Bhangra'. Oh, my God. Has my son already got married? Wait, I am his father. He is not your father. It is too much. I won't let this wedding take place. I will cancel this wedding. Help. Someone help me. Sir, you have fallen in water. Idiot, then has your father fallen in it? Oh, I am very sorry, sir. Sir, have you come to attend the wedding, too? Idiot, it is my son's wedding. Oh, sir, do one thing. - Yes? You come to my room and change your clothes. Okay. Do you have your room here? - Yes, sir. Come on, take me there. - Come on, sir. Yes. Hurry up. Listen. - Yes, sir? Will you serve me a little brandy? - Yes, sir. Very good. Pick me up. From this side, sir. - Oh, yes.

No. Vijay first. Open it. Hurry up. Open it. What's wrong, sir? - Get lost. Sir. Wretched fellow had locked me inside. Where is the wedding taking place? - In the garden, sir. Sir, this is our towel. Shut up. Sir, the auspicious hour is passing away. All right. I know. You go. Why hasn't he turned up yet? Son, listen. - Yes? Why hasn't your father turned up yet? He must be on his way. The auspicious hour of the wedding is passing away. I'll do one thing. I'll go and bring him. How will you go? You are the groom. He must be in the hotel room and he is very stubborn. He won't come if I don't go. Yes. He will have to go. - Yes. Don't worry. I am here. I'll handle it. What will you handle? He is the groom. How will you manage? I have this gun. - Oh, yes. You have this. You have this. So shall I go? You may go. - Thanks. The brigadier wants to meet my father. And your real father has come here. Oh, where is he? We have locked him in the room. Then it is time for me to become my father. All right. We'll use formula 85. - Okay. Sir, where were you? You took so long. Actually I have to face so many difficulties. I had to change my clothes many times. Change your clothes? I mean it is too hot in your country. - Yes. So they get spoiled due to perspiration. - All right. Okay, let's go. - Yes, let's go. Please come. Hurry up. - Please come. Let's go. Be careful. Take care. - Let's go. Watch your steps on the carpet. - Come on, Son. Go ahead. Go. Sit quietly. Okay? - Yes, Daddy. Don't harass the bride. Why would he harass her? Wait. - Oh, God. Wait. This wedding can't take place. You are trapping my son by deceiving him? Hey, you have come again? That, too, unclad? Get lost or I'll shoot you. Whether you shoot me or fire me.. .. my son is getting married and I should stay out? My name is Kandharam. Whether your name is Kandharam or Nangaram.. ..get lost from here. Scram. Get lost. This is not your, but his son's wedding. - Of course. His son's wedding? - Yes. Oh, I've seen you before. Will you get lost or shall I shoot you? Look, you always barge in unclad and harass the people. Do one thing. See the groom's face and decide.. ..whether he is your son or not. That's it. - Right. You are right. I'll take a look right away. - Yes. How did this old man come out of the room? Am I your son? - No. Then why are you needlessly creating this commotion? Idiot. It is too much. How did it happen? This idiot is not my son. Are you satisfied now? - Yes. Do you believe now that he is not your son? Yes. - Come on, get lost from here now.. ..otherwise I'll shoot you at such a place.. Where will you shoot me? That you will keep clapping for a lifetime. Come on, get lost from here now. - Have you seen my son? Handle your towel. - Shut up. He is crazy. A little silly. My son has to go somewhere. Go somewhere? Leaving the wedding incomplete? Right now? He has some urgent work. What's the problem, Son? Yes, it will be a bad omen if he relieves himself here. Yes, you go. Go straight, take a right turn.. ..then go on the right on the left hand. Very simple. - Yes. Come on, Vijay, you shouldn't delay this work. We had a narrow escape. Remove the wedding suit immediately.. ..the auspicious hour is passing away. - Okay. Sir. Sir, this is our towel. - Get lost. Sir. Sir, this is our towel. Sir. Sir. - Your towel? Is it your father's? Sir. Sir, you have taken a very long time. Yes, come on, let's get married. - We will get married? I mean solemnize our wedding. Solemnize our wedding. Yes. Come on, son, please sit. Come on. - You sit, Son. Will the priest's mood get spoiled? Hurry up, Son, the time is passing away. The priest must be fed up, too. How are you, priest? How are you? Madam, we are electricians. There is a short circuit in your house. Yes, there is a danger of your house catching fire. There is leakage at some place. I got an emergency phone call. Did you call me? No, I didn't call you. You are very careless. Your house will definitely catch fire. Oh, then you please check it. Okay. Inspector. Oh, how dumb! Listen. Bijlani. - Electrician. There is something wrong in this room. I understood the moment I stepped in. There is electricity here, but there is no power in it. It's sleeping. Hey. Why is your servant sleeping on the bed? He is not my servant, he is my husband. Oh, no, you married a servant? - Shut up. You fool. - What did you say? Not you, madam, I am saying it to Bijlani. Please go and get chilled water for us. Hey, you fool. I don't want water.. ..I want some tea. Oh, yes. Yes. - Okay, I'll get it. How much sugar? - Well.. Four spoons. Has she left? - Yes. Hey, you are sleeping here peacefully.. ..you have ruined our sleep. Come on, wake up. Hey. Wake up. This is not the right way. We'll have to give him a shock. That, too, of 440 volts. My chance. My turn. - Okay. Hey, what are you doing? Who is it? What are they doing here? - He is an electrician. No they are not electricians. He is that.. useless one.. and he is that scoundrel.. shameless.. They.. They are the ones who are after my life. Do electricians look like them? - What are you saying? Look.. at him. He is behaving so weird. Look. Look at him.. Look, he is dancing. See.. See, see. They are after me. They follow me everywhere. They are also after your daddy. They tell me to follow your daddy. To find out what your daddy eats, what he drinks.. ..whom your daddy meets, whom he doesn't meet.. ..where your daddy goes, where he doesn't go.. ..whom he sleeps with, whom he wakes up with.. Hey, shut up. - Where he.. Bijlani. - Yes, yes electrician. He's not in his senses. - Yes. Exit. - Exit. You fool. - Yes. Not from there, from here. What are you doing? It's your birthday today, so I am wishing you. Wish me after reaching the picnic cottage, right? I'll wish you in such a way at the picnic cottage.. ..that you won't forget it for a long time. Look, Vijay, don't disturb me. Let me keep these clothes in the bag. Roma, who will be wearing so many clothes? Why? Won't we go out for an outing? Yes, we'll go out, but only in the room. You wish me. Then I'll wish you. - Okay. Then again you wish me and I'll wish you again. And two days will get over in wishing each other. They will get over. - And by the way.. ..I have given your bag to Navratan. Oh, no. Navratan. Navratan cannot help us in this situation. Please, Vijay. - Please, Roma. Hello, yes, I have got the bag. I'll bring it immediately. Deewan Hotel. Room no? - 125. 125. I'll be right there soon. Why do they fix wheels on a suitcase? There it goes off. Oh, no. I am feeling scared. - Why? Whenever you become romantic.. ..something or the other goes wrong. Roma, I.. Shall I keep this suitcase in the car? Or would like to sit and go on this? You.. You go away from here. - Why? Go quickly. Go. Are you planning the picnic over here itself?. Go. What is this, Vijay? This looks like a magical box. They turn into chocolates if you keep clothes in it. No, Vijay, I am sure daddy must have gifted this. He knows that I am very fond of sweets. You are fond of them, but can I eat them? - Yes. Thank you. There's something wrong. The chocolates are not good. "What did I take?" "What did you give me?" "What did you take?" "What did I give you?" "I am unaware, so are you, my beloved." "God knows what happened.

Brigadier. - One banana. Am I going to wear all this? One sweet lime. Where are my drugged chocolates? I am also wondering the same. Where are the drugged chocolates? Think. - No, I don't have a clue. You don't know. - No, I don't. Boss number one and number two are waiting for you. Attention. Boss number one is arriving. Is arriving. Is arriving. Good evening, sir. - Shut up. I had told you to get the maps of the atomic plants.. ..and military positions.. Why is the brigadier being unable to give us the same? The brigadier wants to meet you personally for that. Shut up. Shut up. No one has dared to meet me till now. I'll tell him that you don't want to meet him. Shut up. I'll meet him. I'll definitely meet him. I will meet him. Will definitely meet him. And do tell him that if he.. Idiot. ..tries to act smart.. ..I'll give him such a big shock that.. ..he'll be completely doomed. Isn't it good that I got the tickets booked, Vijay? If I had relied on you, it wouldn't be possible at all. When will your Navratan come to our use then? Vijay, this flower is so nice. I want it. No, no, this garden belongs to that crazy Mr. Pestonji. He'll leave his dogs after us if he sees us plucking the flower. Please, Vijay, pluck that flower for me. Roma, that.. Okay, do one thing. You go and hide over there. Yes. Alright. - But hide properly. I'll pluck it quickly. Quietly, alright. Come quickly. Oh, God. What are you both doing here in this get-up?

"There will be a big chaos in the city if I die." "There will be a big chaos in the city if I die." "There will be news about my story.." "..in the newspapers. - So what?" "My daddy will go to the police station to file a complaint." "There will be a murder case on you." "Nobody will be your witness." "You will be given a death sentence." "I'll die, but you'll die as well." "That's the reason I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying.." "..don't shoot me. Don't shoot me." "Don't kill me. Don't kill me." "Believe me, my beloved, there is no other woman in my life." "You are unaware of my helplessness. - Go. Go away." "I have been trapped, don't think that I'm betraying you." "If you allow me, I'm ready to disclose everything." "When you come to know the truth.." "..maybe you'll believe me then." "That's the reason I'm saying, I'm saying, I'm saying.." "..don't shoot me. Don't shoot me." "Don't kill me. Don't kill me." "Two buffoons are after my life." "Two buffoons are after my life." "I know that they are your daddy's enemies." "They called me and threatened me.." "..and told me to chase." - "What?" "Chase. - Shut up." "That's the reason after that fatso I'm all the time." "I'm unaware, but they know everything.." "..about your daddy's activities." "You tell me, what am I supposed to do now?" "Or else kill me." "Kill me. Yes, yes, kill me. ' If you had told me everything earlier.. ..this situation wouldn't have arisen. How could I tell you, Roma? They had threatened me. God knows what both the buffoons might have done. There is a possibility that your life would have been in danger. Okay, we still have time in our hands. I'll give you something, you go and give it to them. What? - Listen. What if anything goes wrong, Roma? Look, nothing will happen. They will be out of our way for 2-3 months. They both will out of our way for 2-3 months. Then we will go for a honeymoon from.. .. Kashmir to Kanyakumari for 2-3 months. You don't like Kanyakumari? Inspector, Harihari Dhara. Yes. - What is the time? 11:30. Why hasn't agent Vijay arrived till now? You fool. - Sorry. Vijay, you were going to get some evidence.. ..against the brigadier, right? Yes, yes, this box contains that big evidence. You'll be delighted after seeing that evidence. Are you telling the truth? Yes, you will be glad. In fact, they won't feel the need to work.. ..for another two to three months after watching this. Oh, you naughty boy. - Oh, so sweet. We are proud of you. - Country first. The country is proud of you. Thanks a lot. Thanks. - Shall I open and see it? No. No. See it after I leave. To be frank, I would have relieved you much earlier.. .. if I had got this evidence before. I mean to say, I would have convinced you. Sir, better late than never. Thank you. - Carry it carefully and best of luck. Thank you. - Bye, bye, bye. Good bye. - Bye, bye, bye. - Thank you. You fool, what was the need to open it in front of him? Let's go there. What is this? - This is a bomb. Bomb. Then why is it not exploding? When the blue wire gets connected with the red wire.. ..only then the bomb explodes. How? You fool, I have to show you such a simple way. This way. You fool. Vijay, you over here? I have come to enquire about your health. Are you okay? Yes, yes, we are fine. Why? Don't you want to chase anyone? Do you remember? You used to tell me all the time.. ..to follow. Follow. To follow my dad, my father-in-law.. ..do this and do that. Why? Even on my honeymoon night.. ..on my first night, I had to follow. Shut up. I'm in this situation due to you and that's the reason.. ..I have exacted revenge from you. No, no, Vijay. This is the last chance to arrest the brigadier. Keep quiet. Shut up. Despite having a wife, you both forced me for a family planning. But now we'll not chase anyone. I'm least bothered if my father-in-law goes six feet under. Now we both are going for a honeymoon. We'll start from Kashmir and then.. ..we'll roam around the whole world. You fool, your father-in-law is selling our country. Yes, then you can go abroad for your honeymoon, right? Can't you keep quiet? Shut up. I don't want to listen to you. Neither you nor him. Yes. Yes. Inspector Giridhari Hara. - Yes, inspector Harihari Dhara. Can you hear something? - What? Our country is calling us. Attention. The king of honeymoon is arriving. What are you doing? I had watched a movie. 'The Sour grapes of the King'. There was a king eating sour grapes like this in that movie.. ..and was celebrating his honeymoon. So I also thought that why not we eat some sour grapes.. ..and do a small rehearsal for our honeymoon as well? Look, Vijay, don't try to be very romantic. Because when you are being very romantic.. ..all are plans go haywire. Something or the other comes up and everything is left out. That's why I have planned everything so well this time.. ..that nothing will go wrong. - What? Yes. No, no, I mean to say that nothing wrong will happen.. ..and our honeymoon will be successful. So before doing a lot over there.. ..shall we do a little bit over here? Look, Vijay, don't trouble me. Let me do the packing. And go and get that. What shall I get? My shoes. What? Boss number one wants to meet me? I was waiting so eagerly for this day. Yes, I'll definitely come there. Yes, yes. I have understood the address. I'll come to the secret den. Take out the finger from your ears. What? - Take out the finger from your ears. Who is it? - Your integrity. Who? - Your conscience, integrity. Soul. Where you were till now, buddy? And why have you popped up today all of a sudden? Since when have you become so ignorant and untrustworthy? You are meeting me for the first time.. ..and you have started accusing me? Tell me clearly what you want to say and.. ..tell me in a better way. And get lost after saying it. Do you understand? You fool, you are there because of me. Okay? - Cool down and think. Is honeymoon the ultimate motive in this world? Though it's not the ultimate one, but it has its own importance. And I have not received even a little bit of that. That's why you are going to Kashmir? Yes, I am going. I don't fear anyone. You have decided about going to Kashmir. When will you think about this great country? What do you mean? I mean to say that.. ..your father-in-law has left the house right now. Are you not aware about it? If you are a true patriot.. ..then follow him. If the country is spared, only then Kashmir will be spared. And if you are able to save Kashmir.. ..you'll be able to celebrate many such more honeymoons. Go, follow him. Follow him. You are under the oath of your motherland. You are under the oath of Ben Kingsley.. ..I mean Mahatma Gandhi. Follow him. My dear integrity, you have shown me the right path. I have to save the country. I have to save the country. Forget the honeymoon, the country comes first. Well done. Very good, I expected this from you. Thank you. - You are always welcome. I'll follow him. I'll follow him. Whom are you going to follow? That fatso. I am under the oath. - Who has put you under the oath? My integrity. - What? My country. - What? Mahatma Gandhi. I'll follow him. Vijay. - I'll follow him. Listen to me, Vijay. What, sir? Shall I chase? - Of course. Yes, now begins the fun. "Keep following. Keep following." "Keep following. Keep following." "Keep following. Keep following." "Though you are with the enemies.." "..whether you win or lose." "Though you are with the enemies.." "..whether you win or lose." Wow. Great. Excellent. Great. Wow. So did you like the place? Hopeless. - Hopeless? Hopeless. - What? Those are nonsensical who say that.. ..they didn't like the place. - Alright. This is not a place, you fool. It's a very special place. Special place. But you are not allowed to praise a lot over here. Why? The whole world knows that there's not a better secret den.. ..then this place in the whole world. The whole world knows it? - Yes. The whole world knows it. You fool. - Fool? Foolish. - Who? Those who don't know this place are fools. That's better. That's better. When will be able to meet number one? Sshh! "Whether it's hot or whether it's raining.." "Whether it's day or night." "Whether it's hot or whether it's raining.." "Whether it's day or night." "No one can escape from here." "Keep following. Keep following." Boss number one is arriving. The countdown begins. Three, four, five. - Number one. No. Five, six, seven, eight. - Number one? No. Eight, nine, two, eleven. Boss number one is arriving. Boss number one? Meet the brigadier. The dog salutes the cat. I'm glad to meet you because you are one of the best.. ..traitors and betrayers of your country. Don't say this, you are far above all of us. Great, I like your sense of humor. Come on, let's get back to business. Yes, come on. Why? Where has sir disappeared? Let him get lost. No one is bothered about me in this house. All have gone mad. You have also gone mad. I'll also go insane. The ghost does not come closer to you. What are you doing, Navratan? You are useless. It doesn't come closer to you. Who are you? - Where is Vijay? Who are you? Lady, your husband.. I mean to say that scoundrel.. ..came to the hospital and he hurt our wounds. We'll not spare him today. Shut up. - Okay. Where is he? - He's gone for a honeymoon. Can a man go alone for the honeymoon? No, but he can go on the moon. Moon. Moon. You fool, we don't want the moon. We want Vijay. Where is Vijay? - I don't know. Lady, answer us or else this.. this injection.. ..will go across your heart. Madam, shall I call the police? Inspector, tie up this man. Yes, he can prove to be dangerous for us. - Yes. Come on. What is this? An ashtray. - An ashtray? I liked it very much. It's nice. - This.. This is not just an ashtray, it's number two. The one who came to meet me before you. He tried to cheat me, so we made an ashtray out of his head. You mean to say that he was of some use to you after he died. So that's why we want that you should be of.. ..some use to us as long as you are alive. Open it and show us. - What? The head? No, the plans. - Where is the cash.. ..which you had promised to pay me? Number two, I am trying to chase you from the past so many days, brigadier. But you escaped every time. I had a doubt that you are a big traitor and betrayer.. ..of our country, but now I am completely convinced. Who is he? Who is he? I don't know. I don't know. Wait, I'll show you right now. Chang. Chang. Chang. I finally caught him, sir. Who is he? How do I know? I am seeing him for the first time in my life. If you can't tell the truth, at least don't lie. The truth can never be hidden by a false truth. Wow. Nice poem. It's a bad one. Wow. So, young man, do you know this donkey? I mean to say, do you know this gentleman, this fearless man.. ..I mean do you know this brigadier? Do I know him? I live in his house. He's mad. Mad. He's insane. Okay, so I am mad? - Yes. Then why did you get your daughter married to a mad person? Oh, so you are his son-in-law? I am his son-in-law for sure. What do you say, brigadier? Son-in-law. I don't have any daughter. Oh, so is Roma your mother? Roma? Who is Roma? My wife and his daughter. What do you say, brigadier? No, no, no, sir, I am an orphan. I have no one of my own in this world.. ..except you and what are you? There are bells ringing in my head. It must be a wrong number, sir. Wrong number. It's possible. Idea. Why don't we do this? That this orphan.. We better call up at this orphan's house.. ..and try to find out his heir. Brilliant idea. - Shut up. I'll call up right now. - Kindly go ahead.

Hey, sir knows his duty well, you don't interrupt. Hello, brigadier, I hope you didn't face any problem in this mission? Not physically, sir. But my heart was shattered to pieces. Thinking that I have stooped so low.. .. in front of my daughter and son-in-law, which has no limits. I am feeling sad about one thing, sir. Neither could I explain them anything.. ..nor they understood anything. I wanted to reach to the boss of this gang.. .. by showing all the fake maps and documents. I can understand, sometimes you have to become a thief.. ..to catch the thief. You have saved the country from getting destroyed and doomed. We all salute to you. - Wow. Mr. I G, I have heard that you are not keeping well? No, nothing like that. Even then you cannot predict life. This is my card, my rates are very economical. I beg your pardon.
