[Father] I Kelly, [Kelly] I, Kelly. - [Father] Take thee, Joseph. - [Kelly] Take thee, Joseph. [Father] To be my lovely wedded husband. [Kelly] To be my lovely wedded husband. [Father] Now, by the power vested in me, I pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss your bride! [chuckles] That's so beautiful. [Kelly sighs] Ah, I wish it could always be like this. [kissing] It's like, sticky, hot, smelling and roasted. [Kelly laughs] No. You know what I mean. - Just promise me something. - Hmm. If we are ever not this happy, We'll come back here. We'll make it all better again. [Joseph sighs] As long as I can be sticky, hot, smelling and roasted. [Joseph] It's okay by me. [gentle ethereal music] [slow suspenseful rock song] [song continues playing] [suspenseful music] [music playing on radio] Doesn't bother you. Does it? [Driver] Music. Does it bother you? I... It's a little loud. [Driver laughs] Stella Bond, The Pixies, that was all pure punk. You know what I am saying? [Driver] That's just putrid if you ask me. Yeah, folk punk, alternative... it fucking all sucks! Classic, country, punk rock! Now, let's twist it, huh! Twist it? Twist it! [chuckles] May be I could bend the helix. That... might work! That might work. Yeah, exactly. [loud music continues] [Driver] So, uh, kinda foggy up there, huh? In San Francisco? Oh! [Driver] It looks like the ice man is coming. I am sorry? [music stops] [Driver] What you got in the case? You clocking or what? [stutters] I don't think so. [bangs] Man! Problem? I just keep forgetting the city is planning to tear this building down. [Driver] And then they said the street's closed off. Well, now I gotta turn all the way 'round. - Sorry about this. - No, no, no. That's fine. I think... the hotel is right over here. I can... I can just walk. - Are you sure? - Yeah. $26.60 plus... You know. Yeah. Um. Fifty, uh... right here. [Driver] You don't have anything smaller? [Joseph] No. Keep it. [Driver] Hey, thanks dude. You're welcome. Twist it. [laughs] [gentle melancholic music] [ominous music] [Joseph] Ah, Joseph Bekins? [Manager] Oh, Joseph Bekins, room 530 as you requested. Need anybody to help you with your bag? No, no. I'm... I'm fine. I have it. Thank you. - All right. - Thanks. All right. Bubba, How you doing? Wardell, Wardell, look alive! - What you do? - I'm moving! - Pass away the day? - I'm working. What's up with you and them gloves, Bubba? You afraid of dirt? [suspenseful music] [computer beeps] [typing] [panting] [suspenseful music] [sighs] [bird screeching] [suspenseful jazz music] [lighter clicks] [fire roaring and crackling] [Official] Hey, lady. The road is clear now. I trust my idea. There will be no more excuses. It's not your word that I want. [television playing] [volume increasing] [Newswoman] Meanwhile, the investigation is still underway for the identity of the charred remains of a man found where it is believed the fire started. [eerie suspenseful music] [papers rustling] [sighs] [laughing loudly] [phone beeping] Honey, it's me. [breathing heavily] I came with a whole new twist. [sighs] A genetic factoring. It was... [sighs] It doesn't matter honey, I'm done. It's over. I am finished. [chuckles] Honey I'm at the... I'm at the Waldorf room in Venice. I am in our room. Honey, everything's going to be okay. It's going to be just fine. I... I really wish you were here. I miss you so much. [melancholic music] [sighs] I miss Matthew. I just... I'll talk to you later, okay? I love you so much. It's going to be okay. [breathing heavily] [door opens] [soft eerie music] [wind bell chiming] [kid singing] [loud suspenseful music] [intense unsettling music] [papers rustling] [ominous music] [computer beeps] [slow ominous music] [computer beeping] [Manager] He looked really stressed out when he... checked in here. I mean really stressed out. What was this? A heart attack of some kind? Well, I believe somebody will notify the family. I... I sure hope so. Well, have a nice day. Just want to make sure this place is really vacant. The last place I worked at was haunted, totally haunted. [Wardell] Okay. Uh, boss... What happened to this guy's personal stuff? Why? You need a computer, man? Police went off through it. I took it, wrapped it up and sent it back to Mr. Bekins family. Now come on boys. Let's get with it! - All right. okie-dokie. - You know what I mean. You see, that don't make no sense to me man. What's boss trying to do? Clean that part of the room? [Bubba] Yeah. Looks like we're a little late for that. [Wardell] Okay. [both grunting] [Wardell] No, no, no, no! Woah! - What's up, man? You all right? - Yeah. I'm all right. [Bubba] Just a matter of... sugar. - [Wardell] You got your stuff? - [Bubba] Yeah, yeah. We're doing hard. I'll do it later. [Wardell] No, no. Forget... [slams dresser] Come on, forget later, man! If your big ass pass out I'm the one who has to carry you outta here man. Go do it now. - [Bubba] Yeah maybe you're right. - [Wardell] Yeah. - [Bubba] Oh fuck... I'll be back. - [Wardell] Aight, Bub. [Wardell sighs] Hey wait. You know what? You might not want to inhale that too deeply. It's dead man's germs on that pillow. [in Spanish] What? Dead man. You don't... [inhales] [in Spanish] Death! [In Spanish] Death! [maid chuckles] [both laughing] [breathing heavily] [Bubba] All right! Boy, look at that honey-baked ham, man. Give me a slice. Chop it up. Why you be doing that? [Bubba] Come on, man. You heard the man. Let's get busy. [Wardell] What's the rush, man? Lets enjoy the view for a second. - [Wardell] Maria... - [Bubba] Oh! [Wardell] All right, All right, All right. [men grunting] [both murmuring] - [Bubba] You ready? - [Wardell] I'm ready. [grunting] [people chattering] [Manager] I told everybody this guy was a stress case. Look at this. Did they have to mention the hotel? That's all I need right now. This bad publicity. [Wardell] Hmm. That's got a way of bringing people in. Look what it did for Bundy Drive. People weird like that. - Hmm. [bell dings] - [Manager] Go on. Excuse me. Do you have a reservation for James please? - James? - Yes. - Yes, we do. - Great. Well, can you fill out this form? Sure can. We requested room 530. - [Manager] 530? - [Kelly] Yeah. [door creaks] - [Kelly] Hello. - [Maid] I'm almost finished. Oh, that's okay, it's no hurry. I am! Go ahead sweetie. It's okay. Excuse me, do you have an extra pillow? He is gonna need one. [in Spanish] Yes! I have one. I'll get it. Thank you. [Kelly] Excuse me. Can I ask you a question? [Maid, in Spanish] What? [Kelly] Have you worked here for a while? Sí. Yes. Do you remember the man who died here? I mean did you ever meet him? No, I don't see nothing. No no. I don't mean you. I mean, when you cleaned the room maybe you found something? Like some small thing. Anything? No. I don't take nothing. No. I don't mean that you took anything. I just... [Kelly] I'm sorry. I... I'm sor... [door creaks] Mom? [chuckling] Huh? What are we doing here? I don't know. Looking for closure I guess. What's "closure"? I really couldn't tell you right now. How about a hug? [hip hop song playing] [mysterious music] [lights crackling] [light crackling] [Joseph singing] ♪ I see the moon ♪ ♪ And the moon sees me ♪ ♪ And the moon sees somebody ♪ ♪ I'd like to see ♪ ♪ So, God bless the moon ♪ ♪ God bless the moon ♪ Daddy? [suspenseful music] It's me. I'm here, Joseph. I am here. Daddy. [flash noise] [tense orchestral music] [flash noise] It's okay. It's okay. [waves crashing] [people chattering] [rock music playing] [pop music playing] [blues music playing] Your dad and I used to love coming down here. We would swing on the swing, and go as high as we could go, and eat ice cream. Ride the Ferris wheel... Just act like a couple of big kids. Because that's what he was really. Just this big beautiful kid. Full of wonder. What's the matter, honey? I miss my dad. Oh. I know you do. I miss him too. I miss him so much. [melancholic music] Hey, what do you say I give you a big push? Yeah? - Uncle Mike! - Hey, how's my... [Mike grunts] My god you are getting heavy. What are you doing here? - Came to take you to dinner. - All the way from San Francisco? Girl's gotta eat right? Right? [Matthew] I want burgers. Cheese burgers. Burgers and cheese burgers! You name it. Anything. - I thought that maybe... - Yeah, well. I've already eaten, I mean, I... gonna take off. - It's only an hour flight. - Uh-huh. [slaps] What do you think? [Kelly laughs] Burgers or me leaving? - [Kelly] You can stay. - [Mike] Oh, okay. [suspenseful music] [people chattering] [Kelly] That was a delicious dinner. [Michael] Ah, it's not every day that you get a burger at a French restaurant. [Kelly laughs] [Michael] You gotta have a little pull you know? So, really. How are you? [Kelly] I am terrific. - [Mike] Yeah. - [Kelly] In my own confused, manic-depressive sort of way. [Mike chuckles] And you think that being down here, being at the hotel, in the very same room where Joseph... Michael, I don't expect you to understand. Hey, don't give me that, if anybody's gonna... Look. [sighs] I miss him too, you know? We are almost there, honey! Go! I guess I just need to deal with it. In my own way. My own time. I understand. Come here. Aah! You and Joseph were the most sentimental people I've ever known. Yeah. Sentimental fools, maybe. Yeah. It's just going to take some time, Kel. There's an understatement. Good night uncle Mike! [Mike] Good night, Hosh. That's for you. [Kelly] Cheers. Nazdarovya. [glass clings] I still can't believe you came all the way down here. [Michael] So, what are you two doing tomorrow? [Kelly] Why? What are you gonna do? Fly back down for breakfast? No, I thought I'd spend the night down here. - [Kelly] Excuse me? - No, I mean... not down here, here. I mean... here, you know? In town. Actually, I mean, here next door. [chuckles] Someone's got to take care of you. Michael, I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. Good night, Michael. [sighs] [Mike] Night. [Kelly] Matt? [bed rattling] [Kelly] Matt, stop it. What? Dad always lets me jump on the bed. Well daddy's not here anymore. [Matthew] But... Mommy, what's wrong? - What? - You'll feel better. I always do. - Yeah? - Jump! Jump, jump, jump! [Kelly] Jump. [bed rattling] [both laughing] [Mike] Can I help you? [sighs] Hmm? What are you doing here? Uh... I thought I heard something inside the room, so... I thought I'd check it out. Yeah? Everything sound okay now? Yeah! Everything sounds fine. Something wrong? No. Everything's cool. Good. Well then, good night. Yeah! All right. - Still here? - Good night. - Good night. - All right, good night. [Mike sighs] [eerie music] [Bubba] Man, I don't believe him. He is going to blow up the whole thing. [suspenseful music] [Bubba] What the hell you think you're doing back there? - Fuck is wrong with you, man? - What the fuck are you doing? Why don't you lighten up, Bubba? Damn! They are onto to your act, bro. All right? You better watch yourself! Don't you be bro-ing me man. I don't know what the hell is wrong with you, man. You ain't got no seniority. - Yeah. That's why you upset? - Seniority? What's your problem, huh? Bubba, you better stop that shit. You gonna be long gone, all right? If you don't cut out that- - I'll be here longer than you are. - You gonna be long gone! If you don't cut out that Peeping Tom shit. [Wardell] Peeping Tom? Why don't you get out of my business, man? Nobody was peeping. I gets mine. Ain't got to peep on nobody. [Bubba mumbles] [door slams] Uh-huh! Uh-huh! You watch yourself! [Wardell pounding on door] Watch yourself! [Wardell] Bust yo' ass, boy!

[Matthew breathing heavily] [melancholic music] [waves splashing] [Kelly] Matt! Matt sweetheart that's enough! Why don't you come in now? [kids shouting] Is he all right? Hardly touched his pancakes this morning. I don't know. He hasn't been sleeping well. He keeps having these nightmares. I don't know, its bothering me. Who do you think sent those letters to Joseph? I don't know. And it's been bothering me too. Because you and I both know nothing ever happened. It's a just a ridiculous lie, is what it is. [Michael] Where is he? He is right over there. [Kelly] Where did he go? [people talking] [eerie music] Hey kid, put that down. - [Lady] Hey! - [Matthew] No. Get away! Wait a minute. Wait. Hold on, hold on. Just put down the knife. Just put down the knife. I don't want you to cut yourself. [Kelly] Matt? What are you doing? Hash, I think you should give that to me now. - Matt... - Get away! Matt! Give me the knife, now. [Kelly] Matt, give me the knife. [Matthew crying] - [Matt] I want to go home. - [Vendor] Is that your boy? Yeah. [Matt cries] Something's wrong with that kid. What's he tripping on? I don't know. He'll be all right. [Kelly] He's not tripping on anything. What are you thinking? There's little kids running 'round everywhere. Someone could get hurt. Can't be legal. No, everything here is legal. Everything here is legal. [Vendor] It's your kid that's crazy. - Get a leash or something. - Hey. That's enough. [Vendor] Look, man. I'm sorry about that. But he must have really wanted it, all right? [Mike] I'll tell you what. I'll buy it from you. We'll forget the whole thing. How much? Make me an offer. Matthew come here. Come here. Listen to me. Listen to me. I don't know what's going on with you. But no matter what it is, we will get through it. It's going to be okay. I love you. Mommy loves you. Now come on. We are gonna go back to our room and we are going to take a nap and it's going to be fine. Come on. Come on. [suspenseful music] [Bubba] You know what I'm looking for. Three more if you find it. [flash noise] [unsettling music] [Joseph] Twisted. Twisted... [tense orchestral music] [flash noise] [Michael] Anyway so, I go down, I reach down to help him out and he reaches up and boom! Plop. I go in the water and there we are, the two idiots just flailing around and drowning and get this... in three feet of water. [Kelly chuckles] [Michael] So... Hey, Hash! [Matthew] Number three, twisted... What did he say? [Kelly] Hey, sleepyhead. Number three what, Matt? [Matthew murmuring] [Kelly chuckling] He is just tired. He will be fine. [bulb explodes] [Matthew screaming] Daddy! [Kelly] Are you okay? Oh no. Here. [Michael] All right just be careful. Just, don't move. All right. Slow. [Kelly] You okay? Who scared you? - Okay, what's the matter? - Can you take him? [typing] Come to me, come to me baby. [mumbling and typing] [chuckles] [phone ringing] [Bubba] Jesus! Front Desk. Bubba speaking. [glass clinks] [Michael] All right. How you doing? You okay? You okay? Good. What are you doing? You already called someone to do that. I know. I just don't want anyone to get hurt. Just stop. Don't get down, stop. Relax. He's okay. He'll be all right. - I know. - Good. [Kelly] You are right. It's just... Hello? Hello? Hello? Hey! How you doing? Where's your mommy? [Bubba grunts] Jesus, kid, come on. Hey. That hurt. [Bubba grunting] [tense music] [Matt screaming] [Kelly] Matt, what are you doing? - Stop it! - [Mike] Stop it. Jeez, what am I? The boogeyman? - [Michael] You all right? - [Bubba] Am I...? [Kelly] I'm really sorry. He's been really upset and confused. [Michael] Hey Kel, boys will be boys, - but this is getting ridiculous. - [Kelly] As I said... I'm really sorry. Please, the problem is in back bathroom. - The problem's in the bathroom? - Yeah. Okay. Well, I'll go check on the problem. [Kelly] Thank you. Where is this monster? [Kelly] Michael, you really have to leave. [Michael] Kelly, don't turn this one me. This is not normal behaviour here. I think that... Well maybe you should talk to somebody about this. What do you mean? I mean... someone professional. [Kelly] You mean like a psychiatrist? He doesn't need a psychiatrist. He's just upset. He's had his whole world turned upside down. [Michael] Yeah. He's upset. A little boy... and you drag him back down here, right to the place where his father... I don't have to answer to you. [Kelly] I don't have to explain myself to you about how I raise my child. [Bubba] All righty. Another day. Another dollar. Circuits checked. Switches flipped. You are all set. Ready to rock and roll. Thank you very much. Oh no, no, no, no, no. That won't be necessary. And this is... - James. - James! All right, uh, any more problems, you folks feel free to call me, okay? - Okay. - I'll be right there for you. Yeah, okay. [Michael] He's very efficient. [Kelly sighs] Listen, Mrs. James... Okay. You know you have your own reasons for being down here and that's fine. But your son's going through some serious grief issues. [Kelly] I keep trying to make you understand. We just need some time alone. [Michael] You ever really think about Joseph's death? What do you mean? I mean, the sudden heart attack, and yeah, we both know how much he pushed himself but... Don't you think it's a little strange? I mean... first he gets an anonymous letter about you and I. And uh... Despite the way I feel about you nothing happened right? - Michael, I don't want to talk about this. - I mean, Joseph, was my best friend. [Michael] He knows that. So... [Kelly] Stop it. [flash noise] [suspenseful music] Is that what you want? You want to screw him? [plane zooming] [Michael] Yeah. I thought about what you said last night. Maybe you're right. Maybe you two should spend some time alone. No, I just, I just wanted to call and say that, uh... if you, if you want... I'll stay. No. I think it's better if you go. All right then. I guess, I'll see you when you get back to town. Yeah. I'll talk to you then, okay. Look. I'm late for my flight. I gotta go. Yeah. Take care of yourself. [Matthew] Who was that? That was your uncle Mike. [Matthew] He is not my real uncle. I know that. That's what you've been calling him since you were born. Anyway, he called to say goodbye. He is going home today. Now it's just me and you. Did you wash your face? Mm-hmm? - Uh-huh! - We're gonna have a terrific day. We'll do whatever you wanna do. [Kelly laughs] Are you ready? [upbeat Latin music] [people chattering] [door opens] Ma'am? Ma'am? It's Wardell. Coming to fix the faucet. You in? Now before you start running your mouth... I... Come here. Let me show you something. [Maid, in Spanish] What are you doing here? What? I'm just looking in the thing. - Come here. - You're the thief? I'm not no thief. [In Spanish] Bandit! - Stop! "Bandito..." -Look at me! What would you say...? Look, she's got so much stuff in here. - No, no. - There's got to be something - for you up in here. - [In Spanish] Oh my God. What "Ah Dios mio"? Why you always yapping? Here, look. Ah, oh my God, look at that. - [laughs] No! - You don't have a watch. - No, no, no. - She will not know! Why you...? [phone rings] Ah, damn! [phone rings] [Maid sighs] See, I was just joking. I wasn't gonna take them. Knock your stuff down. [suspenseful music] [Kelly] What? [Matthew] He is here. [Kelly] Who's here? Who's here? [Matthew] Why don't you want me? [Kelly] What are you talking about? [suspenseful jazz music] [Kelly] Who's here? Where are you taking me? Michael? Michael, what are you doing here? Kel, I am sorry. I tried to leave. I just... I just couldn't. I mean... I feel like I should be here with you. I... I mean to be here with you. Because... [sighs] I love you and I am just worried. [Matthew] Is that what you want? Matt, I didn't know that he was still here. You want to screw him? [slaps] [Kelly gasps] [Kelly] Oh my God! Oh my God! I hit him. I can't believe I hit him. Maybe you're right. Maybe he's jealous. Then why the hell did you come back? Matthew! [gentle melancholic music] I told you why. [Matthew crying] [crying] I am sorry honey. [crying continues] [melancholic music] I am so sorry. [Kelly shushing] [Kelly] I didn't mean to hurt you. [Michael sighs] We're okay. It's okay. [keys clink] All right, okay. Dr. Kessler? Hello, my name is Kelly Bekins. I'm a friend of Michael Novic. He suggested that I give you call while I was here in Venice. No. It's about my son Matthew. Here comes the special power drink. Open wide. And... [gulps] Anymore? All filled up? Good. Watch out for the claw. - You wanna know something? - [Kelly] Yes. - It's a secret. - [Kelly] Yeah, right. I miss your dad too. [Kelly talking over phone] Yep. Ever since when we were kids... Your age, hass. I was always getting us into trouble and bailing us out. [Matthew clears throat] Always, in high school... girls and college... final exams... And then we both started working at the same lab. - And you know what? - [Kelly] Yes, he had a heart attack. He started bailing me out. [both chuckle] Yep. Seemed like every project that I was working on was a bust. That was until your dad took it over. He had this... amazing way of turning my failures into... works of genius. Funny way of leaning in on each other, don't you think? Hmm? [both chuckles] Then he married your mom. [Kelly talking on the phone] And then he had you. But I was his best man. Yep. Stood right there next to him at his wedding. And I remember thinking, the whole time... Life has a funny way of turning around on you. Yep. Joseph. He gone and scooped me again. Sorry he got mad at you, uncle Mike. [chuckles] It's okay, Hash. I get mad too, sometimes, impatient. Just remember, I love your dad too. Go to sleep. Let me tuck you in here. All right. And for good luck. Yes. Closure among other things. Okay. Thank you. [tape rewinding] [Kelly] Closure among other things. [Wardell] What up snoop snoopy snoop? Oh... James on a boobtube. Whatchu doin' kid? [cocks gun] Here's the deal. Now, you tend to your business. And I'll tend to mine. [shouts] One word! One! And I'll blow your brains out. - We cool? - We are cool. - Yeah. - We are cool. [machine beeps] Want a fry? You want candy? [door creaks] [melancholic music] [Joseph] Matthew? - [Joseph] Watch how I do this. - [Matthew] Okay. [Joseph] Okay. Can you... Can you sh... Now you do it. [Matthew] I can do it daddy! [Joseph] Can you do it? Hold on, now watch closely. [Joseph] Watch out. Watch what I am doing. - [Joseph] I fold it here. - [Matthew] Mm-hmm. - And I fold it like this. - Mm-hmm. [Joseph] Can you do it? [Matthew] Yeah. [melancholic music] [flash noise] [dramatic music] [flash noise] [unsettling orchestral music] Matthew... Look, she's a friend of Michael's. You are just gonna talk to her, that's all. It's no big deal honey. She's a really nice woman, Hash. I think you gonna like her. [Michael] You know, she was friend of your dad's. Good morning everyone. [Michael] Gabrielle. Thanks for seeing us in such short notice. [Kelly] Yes. Thank you very much. Oh, for Michael... Anything. I want to offer you my condolences Mrs. Bekins. Joseph was a brilliant man. That's very kind of you. Thank you. [Gabrielle] Matthew? You think we could talk for a little bit? Why don't you take him into my office? Get comfortable. Of course. Come on, sweetie. Let's go for a walk. I had given up on you. [Michael] I was gonna call you when I got to town, but... things got complicated. How? Complicated. That's right, I thought you could sort it out. [chuckles] I see. You need me. Yeah, I need you. [sighs] She is beautiful, Michael. [Michael] Gabrielle, she is just a friend. Hey. And then, umm... What does that make you? So, Matthew. How are you feeling? - Thirsty. - Me too. Mrs. Bekins I hate to ask favors but, could you run down the block and get us a couple of what? Colas? Oh, okay. Sure. Matthew, I'm just gonna run out and I'll be right back. I want you to stay here, okay? Just sit right down there. I'll be right back. [Matthew coughs] Gee, sounds like you have been having some terrible nightmares. Pretty scary, huh? You want to talk about it? You do realize, don't you, Matthew, that... nothing can really happen to you in a dream? Sometimes we just get so much bottled up inside of us that the only way it will come out is within our subconscious. Deepest, darkest part of our minds. Our dream center. You miss your father a lot, don't you? Yes. Do you think about him a lot? [Matthew] Yes. But not like in the dreams. He is... different in the dreams. [Gabrielle] Just... relax your mind, Matthew. Remember... nothing can happen to you. [eerie music playing] You are safe here. You are perfectly secure. Listen to the water. [water gurgling] Let it wash over you. Relax. You're still safe, Matthew. You're in a happy place. A place with your father. [gentle dramatic music] [coffee gurgling] [gentle suspenseful music] [Kelly] We can't survive like this, Joseph. What are we gonna do? [Joseph] Baby, you don't know how this project is. Listen, if I can just figure it out, we'll have more money than we'll ever gonna need. Just let me finish it. [Kelly] But what about in the meantime? We'll lose the house, we'll lose the car, we'll lose everything. [Joseph] It's gonna be okay. It's gonna be okay. [gentle dramatic music] [Michael] Come on, man, you are getting so close. Can't you fell it? But don't you realize what this means? Major patents, millions... Nobel prize for medicine. You got to put that all out of your mind. I'm telling you, I'm completely stuck. I don't know how to finish it. All right, all right. Eh... I got you started down this road, there must be something I can do, let me help. [Joseph] You want to help? You know, lay off. I can't work with you breathing down my neck and her breathing down my neck. [Michael] I'm on your side. Who got you the grant? Remember? [Joseph] You did. How many times do you want me to thank you for it? [kid singing eerily] [Michael] So, what are you gonna do? Just leave? [Joseph] Yeah, I gotta get out of here. I need to concentrate. [Matthew] Where are you going, daddy? Honey, I got to go away for a little while. Why? Why? [scoffs] Good question. Eh... You know this thing I'm working on out here that's taking so much of my time... I'm so close to being done, if I can just figure out the last part, it'll help a lot of really sick people. Is it medicine? Um, it's kinda like medicine. It's... This... you know what? Doesn't matter. What's important is when I come home, you and me are going to go on a trip, all right? We're going anywhere you want to go. - On a plane? - Sure! Plane, car, boat, whatever you want. What about a helicopter? Helicopter? [chuckles] Yeah! Yeah? Okay, helicopter, if that's what you what, that's what we'll do. Take care of your mum, all right? I love you. You're the man of the house now. So, watch it. [gentle dramatic music] No, daddy. Don't go. Don't leave, daddy. [gentle dramatic music] Part three... I found a new twist. [intense dramatic music] [inaudible] [music continues] [unsettling music] Daddy? Daddy, wake up! Daddy? [ominous music] [Matthew screaming] Daddy! [whimpering] It's all right. Shh... [unsettling music] [cries] [eerie music] Well, it's clear he's suffering through the later stages of separation trauma. And with the child's imagination the mood swings can be very volatile. [soft suspenseful music] [ominous music] [Matthew, whispering] Come back... [Matthew whispering] Wake up! [flash noises] [intense unsettling music] [bulb clicks off] [bells tolling] [tense music] [Gabrielle] I'd like to see him again as soon as possible. Actually, I was going to take him home tomorrow. Back to San Francisco. Tomorrow? [Kelly] Yes. I see. It's just... It's hard to establish trust, in the early going. [Kelly] Michael, could you go get Matthew for me? I feel like we've taken up enough of Dr. Kessler's time. [Gabrielle] Not at all. Thank you. Thank you very much. Just out of curiosity... Uh, uh... did you find the closure you were looking for? I think so. [Michael] Matthew's supposed to be at the reception area, right? Of course. [Michael] He's not there. [tense music] Matt! Matthew! Matt, where are you? - Did you see him? - No, you? - No. - Hold on. Relax. Relax. Listen, you think he knows his way back to the hotel? I don't know. I mean, it's just right down the street, right? All right, listen, you give me your room key, I'll go back to the hotel and look for him. You stay around here looking for him here and if he's not there, I'll call the police, okay? - Okay. - Thanks, all right, go. Matthew! [tense music] - [Bubba] Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Let me go. What's the matter? Listen, what's the matter? Are you okay? Huh? Where is your mother? Where is your mother, huh? [grunts] Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Calm down, calm down. Okay? All right. Come on. Mum and uncle Mike think I'm crazy. That's why they made me talk to the doctor lady. Oh, Dr. Kessler. Yeah, I know all about it. You know... like this Michael guy, he's not really your uncle, is he? He is a friend of my mum's. But not a friend of yours. No, not exactly. [soft dramatic music] That is a pretty nice airplane. Where did you learn how to make those? My father. Your father? He is an artist and a biochemist? That's pretty nice, Matthew. Yeah. He was. [Bubba] You've been in a real stir ever since your father died, huh? He wanted to help sick people. He wanted to take me on an helicopter. [whimpering] A real one, but he killed him. He? He who? [door creaks] Close the door. Close the door. This won't take long. All right. [Gabrielle] Where is she? [Michael] She's still looking for the boy, right? [Gabrielle] He knows, you know? It's all there in his dreams. The murder, his father. You. They can't prove anything. And nothing can't be gained without the goddamn third disk. Shape up, Michael! She's got the disk. She came down here to find it and she's got it. Why else is she leaving tomorrow? The roof. She went out to the roof last night. Please. Don't embarrass me again, Michael. I introduced you to my friends, my contacts, because I told them they could trust you. [chuckles] I just need more time. [Mobster] Actually, you are out of time. What do you want to be? Wealthy man or dead man? Hmm? All right. Okay. [sighs] [eerie music] Well, I think we are back on track now. Yeah, I think so. [ominous music] [muffled gunshot] [tense dramatic music] Detective Williams will be with you in a minute. [Bubba] Okay, thanks pal. Come on, Matthew. Sergeant! Hey. Look who's here. - How are you doing? - What's up, buddy? - All right, how are you doing? - Good, man. [grunts] Now, you got to show me some ID. - ID? Wait, wait, I bet you - ID! five dollars that mine is even uglier than yours, huh? It is. [both laughing] Detective Laurence Johnson. Government Intelligence? That's an oxymoron right there, buddy. [chuckles] [Bubba] I just want you to feel it out, okay? Just talk to this guy. - You got a photo? - Oh, yeah. It's in the file. The ugly one on the left. Here. - Okay. - All right. All right, I'll tell you what I do. I gotta send some men over anyway because we're gonna blow that building up on the corner. And crowd control is going to be pretty tough so I'll be in that area anyway. Great. [suspenseful music] Hey, no. No luck. Did you call the police? Yeah, I called them. They took a description so they keep an eye out for him but they can't issue a missing person's until he's been missing for 24 hours, standard policy, okay? Oh, God! Now, what triggered this? He was fine last night. - What, did he sleep well? - Yes! Did you? Yes. Where? On the roof? What do you mean? Why do you ask me that? It's a simple question, Kel. Where you on the roof? Yes, I was on the roof. Why? Because... because Joseph and I loved going up there. [dramatic music] Because we loved to take a bottle of champagne and make love under the stars. Because, because I still love him. Any more questions? [melancholic music] No. Come on. - Where are we going? - Over here. To an empty building? Yes, the manager said that kids like to play there, so I figured that... you know, it's a perfect hideout. [alarming music] Matt? Matt? Hash! [ominous music] Matt? Matthew? Oh really? My maintenance fee? No shit! Why didn't anybody tell me? Yes, sir. I will. I will. Mr. Bubba, undercover. Well, I'll be damn. I just got off the phone with the FBI. They said I gotta follow your orders now. I don't have much time to chitchat, Mr. Jazz. The woman, 530. Is she still checked in? No, why? [sighs] Oh, nevermind. Look, do me a favor. Look after my little friend, will ya? - Yeah, you're the man. - No, you're the manager. Look, I'm gonna be back, okay? I'm gonna go find your mum. [hands slapping] [Wardell] Oh, that's nasty, Bubba. I got your back though, boy. FBI! [chuckles] I had no idea. - Yeah. - He just told me he was like tryna buy some, uh... just juice for the tabloids. [Manager] Yeah... And he gave me some juice on you. - Juice on me? - Yeah. - What? - You're fired. [softly] Oh, man. - You joking? - No. Matt! Okay, that's it. I'm not waiting 24 hours. Screw policy. I'm going to the police. Wait. I agree. Do you have a picture of him? They'll wanna know what he looks like. Oh my God. I don't know if I have one with me. I must have it. Here. Let me. [items clatter on the ground] Michael, what the hell are you doing? I'm looking for closure. [sighs] Look at this. Sweet. You all looked so happy then, a regular Brady Bunch in the making. [Kelly] What I think is important right now is finding Matthew. No. [heavy door rumbles] The only thing that's important right now is me getting a straight answer from you. I know why you came back here. It wasn't for sentimental purposes, closure, emotional healing. Love on the roof? Did you find the third disk? What disk? Like these. Numero one. Numero two. Now, you know that without numero three your husband's work on these is worthless and that would be an incredible shame. Uh-uh-uh-uh. Stalemate. You give? Michael, I have no disk. I don't believe you. I don't care. [mocking] 'I don't...' But I care! It's 20 million dollars worth of care. Joseph showed me the offer. Oh, my God. You remember? Remember when I bought the house on the lake? See, unlike Joseph I sold my project. I didn't want to be buried in research forever I wanted a life. I wanted to give, I wanted a family. It was all set up. See? The Russian mafia paid me well. Of course, my name was buried because they couldn't give credit to the man who created a virus that could wipe out half the world instantly. Oh... But good ol' Joseph... [buckets rattling] with his AIDS care serum? Well, he was obsessed. He didn't care about you... Matt, the important things. And yet they honor him? They promised him millions in gold and monuments? Do you think that's fair? Just... just give me the disk, Kelly, and everything will be all right. No. It'll never be all right again. And I've nothing for you. [spits] Well. Then I have something for you. What is that? This? Oh... This is my little pet project. [eerie music] Killroy. See? It's an amazing little drug. See, it destroys, strokes out the cardiovascular system. Death within minutes. Heart attack. And it's untraceable. Just ask Joseph. [scoffs] You're insane, Michael. He loved you. He trusted you, you were his best man. And he was mine! What? What? Do you think.. do you think that I wanted to kill him? I loved him too, you know? But he shut me out. And now you? [sniffs] You know the way I felt about you, don't you? Don't you? Yes, Michael. I know. Then don't make me do this. [ominous music] This people I'm dealing with aren't fooling around. If you- If you just... [sighs] Just give me the disk. [Kelly sighs] We can put all this behind us. I can make you better again. I'll cut you into half of the deal, I swear. [Kelly sobs] [sobs] Where is it? On the roof? You probably have a secret spot. Tell me! [deep sigh] - Oh God. - Okay... [whimpers] See, if you don't give me the disk, I will hunt down your boy and he will join Joseph, too. I'll give it to you, Michael. I'll give it to you. [grunts] [punch thuds] [tense music] Where are you going? That was nice. Hurt me. Hurt me, if you got to hurt me. [Kelly screams] And if you got to hurt me, you want to hurt me? You want to hurt me? [kick thuds] [Kelly grunts] [tense music] The man's with the woman? You sure? Thanks, Mary Ellen. Oh, no no. [pipe thudding] [tense music] Yeah... [Manager] Well, gentlemen. Are you enjoying your stay? Wonderful! Has Mr. Novic checked back in, yet? No. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Goodbye, Kel. [climactic music] [kicks thudding] [Bubba grunting] Sorry, I forgot to knock. But the door was open. [tense music] [Michael groans] [exhales] You okay? No! Don't touch it. Just a drop of it is enough to kill you in a matter of seconds. Killroy? Yes. [Bubba] A gift from Michael Novic. [Kelly] How did you know that? [Bubba] It's my job to know that, ma'am. Mrs. Bekins... I'm with the Bureau. I've been a fan of your husband's humanitarian efforts. I was assigned by the Bureau to... protect him, only I didn't do such a good job. Mom! Matthew? I was so worried about you. Little buddy... I thought I told you to stay put. There are men in the hotel looking for Michael. One of them talks funny. Is that right? [ominous music] I'm in a basement of an empty building near the Waldorf. Yeah, he needs to send a containment unit over as soon as possible. Three suspects possibly- [dull bang sound] [unsettling music] [Bubba] Go, go Matt. Run Matt, run! [Bubba] Go with him! Go, go, go! [board rattles] [tense music] [grunts] [Michael] Excuse me. [Bubba grunts] [gasping for air] [intense suspenseful music] [Michael grunts] Wait. [whimpers in pain] [panting] [intense suspenseful music] Come back. Police! Hey! Don't go there! Stay right where you are. [gunshot] [Policeman] You! Get down fast. - Where? - Well? Down! Uh... on the floor? [Policeman] Hands and elbows, that's it. Don't worry, I can do it. [intense suspenseful music] Jesus, Burt? Leonard! Come on! Hey... [eerie music] Just hang in there. You hear me? The boy... The boy was right. Michael... a fake. [Matthew] Mommy, mom! Get out, Michael! Run, Matt! This is C.O. to field. [Williams mumbles] The boy, the boy and his mum... [struggling] They're still in the building, [gasping] you... You gotta save them. [metal door clangs] [tense music] [Michael grunts] [eerie music] [banging] [Michael] Kelly! Mom! [banging] Come on! Come on! It's stuck! [suspenseful music] [tense music] Come on, Matt! Come on, hurry! Mom! Come on! [tense music] Reach! [coughing] Daddy! [Joseph] Matthew, don't be afraid. [melancholic music plays softly] [tense music resumes] [Joseph] Jump! [Kelly grunts] [intense suspenseful music] [tense music] There you are. [eerie music] I promised that I would make this... quick and painless. [tense music] [creaks] [Kelly screams] [ceiling rumbling] Ouch. [eerie music] [ominous music] Just hold on, Bubba! Hold on! Let's get him through here. Get him out, get him in the truck right away. Clear it out! All you people, clear it out! Hold on. Detective Williams, it's show time here. We're about ready to throw the switch. [Williams] Look, I have some people unaccounted for. [machine beeping] [ominous music] Run, Matt. Run! No, I'm not leaving you. Mom? What does this mean? It means we got to move! [unsettling music] [both gasp] It' over, Kel. No place left to run. [suspenseful music] [Kelly groans] [suspenseful music] [eerie music] Killroy? [ominous music] Well, Joseph. You got me again. [dramatic music] [machine beeping] [people chattering] [soft melancholic music] Look! That's what I've been waiting for. Okay, we've got Bubba. Is there anyone else in there? [melancholic music] It's all clear. Let it blow. [grunting] [loud explosion] [building rumbling and crackling] [eerie music] Get him over here, now. Come on, now! Thank you. Don't thank me. Thank this guy right here. Come on, let's get him out of the way. Mr. Johnson? I can't thank you enough for what you did. You're alive. Both of you. That's thanks enough. [Matt] Mr. Bubba? I want you to have this. - What's this? - I made it for you. Thanks. Give me a kiss, buddy. [chuckles] You are something special, kid. Hey! Take care of your mum. Take care of her. - [Williams] Let's get him out. - Thanks, Simmon. Don't worry about it, you're gonna be all right. Get him on that truck and get him out of here now! [struggling] We got to play, right? [Paramedic chuckles] Yeah, we got you, buddy. Roll him out! [melancholic music] [Williams] Hey, gipsy woman. You take care of him. [siren wailing] [gentle uplifting music] [Driver] Wow... It's really nice to see they tore that building down, huh? You can see everything. [inhales] Feel like you can breathe better. It's weird, huh? No... Not at all. [rock music on radio] [Kelly] Excuse me, do you mind? [Driver] Too loud? - Just a bit. - Sorry. - You all ready to go? - Yeah. [engine starts] [Joseph singing] ♪ I see the moon ♪ ♪ and the moon sees me ♪ ♪ And the moon sees somebody I'd like to see ♪ Honey, daddy is so proud of you. I'll always gonna be here for you. Okay?
