Diving is the most fabulous distraction you can experience. I am miserable out of the water. It is as though you have been introduced to heaven, and then forced back to Earth. It's a beautiful sight. Okay. - Captain, This is Jennifer. - Jennifer. Um, what's it like down there? Okay. It's fantastic. Imagine having no weight. Imagine that this would be underwater. You would just inhale your lungs and you would float around. You would move like this swimming in space above all your little friends. It's beautiful. Captain, we have a question here. I am fascinated by the element, water. The world we live in on Earth, it is a struggle against gravity. But, by diving, when you put an Aqualung on your back, you suddenly are turned into an archangel. In harmony with the one single thread around which all forms of life have been created. It's liberation. You describe yourself as a witness to change. When in fact did you first become aware of the way that the planet we're on was changing? Well, when my friends and I started, it was for us, for ourselves. The pleasure of discovering. Look sharp, they're diving! Stand by with the buoy! Falco and Piel, get ready! I thought that my job was to show what was in the sea, the beauties of it... so that people would get to know and love the sea. Then we began to see that the things that we had admired were beginning to decay. And we said, "We have to do something." "We have to enter the fight." Because you will only protect what you love. Good evening. I have no doubt that you'll recognize the face on the screen behind me. It's that of Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau. For the past 25 years, Captain Cousteau's books and films and television series have reached hundreds of millions of people all over the world, sharing with them one of the great discoveries of our time, the mysterious, incomparably beautiful world under the sea. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau. First, Captain Cousteau, I'd like to ask you how you account for this lifelong preoccupation with the sea? When I was a very small boy, I was fascinated by the fluid element that was capable of supporting very heavy ships. I couldn't understand very well how it did it. But you could have learnt all that in museums, and by walking about on the surface, what extra insight did you get by diving? Uh, you never experience a difference between reading a book - and doing it yourself? - Good point. If you read a book about love making, it's not the same. "Every explorer I have met has been driven by curiosity. "A single-minded, insatiable, and even jubilant need to know. "We must go and see for ourselves." Since I was a kid, I had a tremendous desire to search and go further. So, at the age of 20, I entered the Naval Academy. And I chose, as my specialty, airplane pilot. And I was at the pilot school of the Navy, when I was driving at night. But then I had an accident, a very bad accident. I had a right arm paralyzed, 12 bones broken, I... I was in a bad state. "I was alone at night, bleeding, on a country road, "with nobody to come. "It was 2:00 in the morning. "I was losing blood. "Turning to the sky, looking at the stars, I thought I was going to die. "But strangely enough, that became for me, "a wonderful opportunity." Cousteau was told that he should go, and see my grandfather Philippe Tailliez, who was one of the very early free divers in the Navy, and Frederic Dumas, who was not in the Navy, but he was a very famous spearfisher at the time. And Tailliez and Dumas thought that they could probably help Cousteau recover, through swimming. When my grandfather and Cousteau started freediving, they had the whole sea to them, because nobody else was doing that at the time. All the fishermen were jealous about these three guys that would go straight into the water, and come out with the biggest fishes. They were quite famous on the French Riviera. The local press would call them, "The three diving Musketeers". Simone wanted a life as a sailor on the sea. Her two grandfathers were admirals and all of her family were sailors. She said, "I don't have blood. I have saltwater in my veins." When she married Cousteau, she made a deal with him. "I give you two children, Jean-Michel and Philippe, "and you give me the sea." Simone started coming with us, on all my expeditions. And after two years, we already knew how to dive very well. But we had an inner urge to go deeper and further. It's always the same, necessity. In order to go deeper, in order to stay longer, I became an inventor by necessity. "I took normal breaths in a slow rhythm, "bowed my head and swam smoothly down to 30 feet. "I felt no increase in water pressure" "It was a new and promising device, "the result of years of struggle and dreams, diving could be revolutionized." "We had been years in the sea as goggle divers. "Our new key to the hidden world promised wonders. "But unfortunately, our Utopia was doomed to disappear." Within four short weeks, French defenses had been utterly shattered. And Adolf Hitler has claimed Paris as his own. After France surrendered, my wife and I didn't sleep much. I always had a gun in my pocket, I was looking outside before I went out. But during all that time, we still had the sea. For my grandfather and for Cousteau, diving was an escape from the war. Because above the sea, nothing made sense. "I was determined to have a career. "And it was during the war that I realized that the autonomous diving suit "could be a serious business. "There were hundreds of jobs for divers in the scuttled fleet, "and in the ships torpedoed at sea. "So when the war was over, I told officials at the Navy Ministry "about this entirely new system we had developed." Cousteau got a boat from the French Navy. And the whole team was supposed to go diving. Cousteau was trying to finance a new boat and he wanted to prove that the Aqualung could go more than 100 meters deep. Which had never been done. It was like electricity in the air, a mix of excitement and fear, with all the journalists taking pictures. Cousteau was going to make the Aqualung famous. And they were going to try to break a record. The first person to go down, Maurice Fargues, died that day. "Fargues is the first of my team that I see disappear. "This drama upsets me for months. "I start to wonder if what I am undertaking makes sense. "If it is not asking too much of these men "to risk their lives for a hypothetical conquest." After the death of Fargues, it was no longer the "Three Musketeers". My grandfather just knew it had to be different for him. He said, "His death must not be in vain. "It is up to us to learn from it, and the lessons it contains". My grandfather was also an early ecologist. And he was one of the first to realize how precious the reef is... and how quickly it can disappear. And he told Cousteau they have a role to play to protect it. He said, "We are opening Pandora's Box." But at the time, Cousteau had another agenda. Calypso was basically a minesweeper, built in 1942 in America. And I acquired her for very little money, thanks to a grant given to me by a British citizen. And she has gone practically everywhere around the world with me. Journal number one. We are at sea, at long last, enjoying this first day of navigation on the Calypso. We have started with a full-scale expedition to explore the reefs of the Red Sea. Journal number two. Since we left, bad weather has never stopped. It is raining, it is cold, and the swell is at least force six. We are thrown from one side to another, 24 hours a day. And I spent a horrible night fearing for my vessel. So we sailed north again and found a very good shelter. A poetic and desolate island. "I have that feeling of trespassing when I submerge. "The feeling that you're cheating. "We're land animals "and we're not supposed to cross the threshold. "Nature warns us 'Don't go.' "But we do go, and the sense of trespass vanishes." The whole world was being discovered. And we had no idea that we were destroying it. Setting off dynamite to count the fish at the surface, you know, to see how many fish lived underneath. We just didn't know any better at the time. This is an underwater hunt by Captain Cousteau's group in the Persian Gulf. These men are searching not for pink pearls, but for black gold. Oil. "The only field in which I know I am gifted is cinema. "It's a built-in sickness. "I feel miserable if I don't make a film." When I was about 12, I saw my first underwater films. And I found them miraculous. People at that time had no idea what was going on under the surface. So that was a revelation for me. That's when I understood the strength, the power of images. I started taking movies at the age of 13. I began to make little stories about the marriage of my cousin. And also, with my brother, we imagined a gangster story. During all those years, everywhere I went, my notebook was a camera. And after I invented the Aqualung, I wanted to show my friends what I was seeing. But, to photograph underwater I had to put a camera in a housing. So I had to invent that too. Action! Action! "I become furious "when they label my films with the word 'documentary.' "That means a lecture by a guy who knows more than you." "Our films are not documentaries. "They are true adventure films." Bridge, engine room! Bridge, engine room! Something has just stalled the port engine! We've crashed into a whale. The cuts are so deep, it cannot survive. We speed up to put the whale out of its misery. "I dreamed of being the John Ford or John Huston of the ocean." Action! "To offer beauty to my fellow human beings." "A moment of grace, "I slide into the depths, aware of living in harmony "with an environment very different from the world above. "I swim almost effortlessly, "like the fish I meet. "I am an unexpected guest, "spellbound by this splendor. "This silence. "This harmony." In London last night, a man gave a lecture paving the way to a time when human beings will live continuously under the sea. Commander, is this development of the ocean bed an adventure to you, or does it have practical applications? I don't think we can name it an adventure. It is a succession of carefully planned and prepared steps. We are moving into the sea, deeper and longer. In the coming years, we will establish settlements where men will live completely in the water. So this is a bright future for diving. Because it will eliminate all ties to the surface. Cousteau said to me many times that an explorer has no right to be a family man. He's off following his nose, to the future and to the universe. And that's how it needs to be. The children, they were not cared for. They went to boarding school. And Simone, she was more interested in a life on the sea. She had only one passion, Calypso. What most people don't realize is that my mother spent more time on the ship than my father, my brother, and myself together. She doesn't like to be on film, and that's why she has avoided it. She stays away from the cameras. She's the strong person behind the scenes. Uh, people confide in her, and she makes a lot of decisions, which most people don't even know about. They don't even know she exists. Jean-Michel, what was it like on Calypso as a young kid? I cannot compare with anybody else, since this was a natural thing. I was invited there for my vacation. And it took many years for me to realize that this was very unusual. You have to be prepared to make all kinds of sacrifices. You have to agree to have a very sketchy family life. Philippe, what's the biggest blunder your father ever made? That's too hard to answer, really. Okay. Philippe was like his father. Always doing dangerous things, fearing nothing. Cousteau was like a king with his empire. And Philippe was the next king. In the perpetual darkness, Philippe Cousteau focuses his underwater camera on a unique experiment. The oceanauts will try to repair a production type oil wellhead, 370 feet deep. The petroleum companies had given Cousteau a contract to do scientific research. And he used the money to fund Calypso, and to continue his explorations. It may have been a wrong turn in his path to the future. But the world at that time didn't understand the danger to the environment. So, for Cousteau, that was a means to an end. Once we had finished this chapter, we had done the work of a pioneer. So we turned this over to the industry, to use it. But we wondered if we were doing the right thing. They put the Jacques Cousteau footage on the air, and it was a big success. One day I'm sitting in the house and I tell my wife, "I bet you that'll be a great series. "Jacques Cousteau going underwater, around the world, "The Seven Seas, was my thought." So I flew to Monaco and spoke with Cousteau. He says, "I just figured the money, you have to do 12 hours. "I can't do it in less than 12 hours." So I go back to New York to sell the 12 shows. I go to NBC, they don't even know who Jacques Cousteau is. Who is he? "Well, he's the undersea guy who invented the Aqualung." "We don't care." I go to ABC, who is there but Tom Moore. He looks at this thing, this is terrific, but I can't take 12. But he says, "David, you know, I'm a member of The Explorers Club "and I have not been able to find an explorer to speak at my goddamn thing. "Can you get Jacques Cousteau to speak?" I said, "Well, you know I could ask him." He said "I tell you what. "You get Jacques Cousteau to show up, I'll put the 12 shows on the air." And the rest is history. Action! I started on the Cousteau series in 1967. And I was given a huge editing room because there was so much footage. Sharks, whales, and things I had never seen before. The shark is said to be a fearsome brute. But this is not always true. Many harmless species exist, sand sharks, spotted dogfish, nurse, and leopard sharks. But for a diver, a shark bite, whether accidental or deliberate, is always serious and sometimes fatal. Hello, Raymond. Hello, Raymond. What depth are you at? What depth are you at? I have abandoned or almost abandoned feature films, the production of feature films for television, for only one good reason. Though it is an aesthetic sacrifice, it is a way to reach, by the only real mass medium there is, millions of people rapidly. Well understood, Raymond, well understood. We are all okay. He had that wonderful persona. But the general audience at that time didn't know who Jacques Cousteau was. As our assistants logged him, "There's an old man in a red beanie cap on deck." So, we had a lot of discussions about, how are we going to present him? Is he a scientist? Researcher? Or is he a philosopher? Or an inventor? But in his close-ups, he really looked like a man looking at the future. So we decided, he's the explorer. Because his motto was, "il faut aller voir." You know, "We go see it for ourselves." The New York Times says The Undersea World of Jacques Cousteau has opened the eyes of millions. ...through his underwater films, which are shown on 100 other television networks throughout the world... ...have not only popularized underwater science and discovery... Captain Cousteau has been more responsible for introducing people to the world beneath the sea... Captain Jacques Cousteau challenges the most treacherous of undersea worlds. Tomorrow, Captain Cousteau will set out on what he's called the greatest and most difficult expedition of his career... Captain Cousteau perhaps has done more than any other individual to reveal the mysteries of the oceans... The average audience is 26 million viewers. 8-time Emmy Award winning... Jacques Cousteau. The most popular documentary series in broadcasting history. "I have produced for television 52 one-hour films. "The start was curiosity. "The enthusiasm about beauty. "Then came the period of alert, "because we were looking at things that were actually disappearing. "And so my past life, as just a mere explorer, is over." Mr. Chairman, I am greatly honored to have been invited to come here today to talk about the element to which I have devoted my life. The sea. The sea that is today, as everybody knows, in distress. I spent my life sailing and swimming through the seas. In 30 years, I have seen coral reefs turn into wastelands, rich fishing grounds depleted. And when I was diving recently, in the Gulf of Lyon, I was disturbed to find that we have practically destroyed the original fauna of the continental shelf. What we are facing is the destruction of the ocean by pollution and by other causes. For the past two centuries, people have been totally unaware that there was an ecological problem. It was understood that the sea was a vast expanse, a body of water so big that you could throw anything in it and it would not matter. So that is what we did. Last year, in America first, and then in Europe, and Japan, people began to understand and there was an environmental protection movement created. People start pollution, people can stop it. Along with my son, and with my friends, we decided to create The Cousteau Society. Together with thousands of concerned citizens, like you, we have begun a nonprofit organization to save not only the sea, but the precious living systems of our water planet. Join now. Call 1-800-648-5000 or write to this address. The awareness of the people is growing. But there is still a lot of work to do. So I am dedicating all the rest of my film activities to try to convince people that they have to do something about this. So, films that are no more just about beautiful little fish, but that are dealing with the fate of mankind. For example, more than 600 drums containing deadly lead tetraethyl were onboard a Yugoslav freighter, Cavtat. And the ship was rammed and sank in the south of Italy, three miles off shore at a depth of 300 feet. Some of the drums are already opened up, and they are going to release this deadly poison into the Mediterranean Sea. So it's a difficult problem to solve. And all governments are turning their back to it. Judge Maritati orders the Saipem Company to begin salvage, helped by the Calypso divers, Albert Falco and Raymond Coll. I, of course, was involved at various stages of the operation. And once the ships were there, the divers began to work. (MUSIC CONTINUES Ninety-seven percent of the lead was recovered. The rest is lost, because some of the drums had already been damaged. Captain Cousteau, I know you have thoughts about the world's resources being used up. And you've seen it happening year after year. Apparently a lot of people who should have didn't. Do you have anything you want to say about that? Well, uh, I was already involved in, how to say, scanning, the possibilities of extracting energy from the sea. It was a choice that I made many years ago. But what I was shocked by, is the speed and the shamelessness, with which the industrial interests have threw to the waste basket, all of the environmental measures that had been very laboriously taken. I feel responsible, I feel guilty as everybody else, as you should that we are drawing blank checks on future generations. We don't pay. They are going to pay. One of the jobs of The Cousteau Society is that we want the truth to come to the people. And we are amazed to find out that we became the fastest growing non-profit organization in just two years. Now you're talking about the Cousteau Society in the United States, and that is, what's its membership at the moment? A hundred and sixty thousand. And it's growing fast, because we are a young society. What are you aiming for? What sort of membership? Several million. - How many? - Several million. In Houston, USA, 11,000 people flocked to listen to the man who according to a recent survey is the celebrity that next to the president, most Americans would like to meet. Their hero is Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Involvement Day is to reawaken a sense of hope that our actions will not further abuse our life systems. And in the words of Captain Cousteau, it's going to be up to ordinary citizens. Captain, this is Matt. Well, I'd like to ask you how you feel about underwater civilizations in the future? Ooh. I must admit that I once proposed this, but I don't think that we are going to develop an underwater civilization. I think, uh... we should first build a good civilization on land. In 1954, I shot a feature length film called The Silent World. Where in which there was a sequence, where we saw sharks feed dramatically on a damaged baby whale. And, uh, our men got so furious, that they brought them on board the ship, and they began to hit them on the head, and to kill them. It was a real slaughter of these sharks, a kind of age-old revenge of seamen, you know, that hated sharks for generations. All right. Now, recently, I saw that film again because I was asked to show it again in Paris. And you just... I couldn't... I couldn't agree. I cannot show it anymore because we all have changed. Mentality has changed and we couldn't handle the shark in the same way today. I think that we are lucky. We travel a lot and we see things that the others don't. So it is a duty for us to share these things with them. And to think a lot about our responsibility. And we often discuss this, Philippe and I, and Philippe shares my philosophy on this 100 percent. It's a great satisfaction to find the same understanding with your main collaborator. You know? - That's wonderful. - Well, the basic philosophy I think is that you cannot really enjoy what you're doing if you don't share it. That's right. December five. I commit Calypso to the perilous Drake Passage that lies between the extreme tip of South America and the Antarctic Peninsula. But at the approach of these polar waters, we feel alien. We dive in fairly muddy water. The red algae gives us a waving, inviting welcome. Along the cliff, down to one hundred feet, we discover an unexpected profusion of life. I am eager to take down the diving saucer, to explore the deeper polar waters. Falco will pilot the saucer while I film. A little lower, an opening gapes in the wall. Dull, cracking sounds are warnings that the iceberg is under immeasurable internal stress. It is a giant crystal, melting under my eyes. We are witnesses to the vanishing of an eternity. You know, I must tell you that I hate danger. I'm not one of these people who have to have a thrill. But you too, I think we, we all in the family, we are not daredevils at all. - Yeah. - Yeah? Oh, but you're flying planes. - Mm-hmm. - You don't like him... - I don't know. - You don't like him to fly planes? - Well, I'm not so sure. - Hmm. Philippe had this idea to make a film in North African countries, and I approved it. And he started with his airplane. And... that was it. Why? How? Philippe was an excellent pilot. A poorly latched hatch on the nose of the plane had just annihilated my beloved son and a part of me with him. Arms, present! We are here in joy. And I share that joy with you, with tears in my eyes because of the great absence tonight... Philippe. After Philippe died, Jacques' entire physical appearance was absolutely different. He had aged ten years. He was bent over, his skin was sallow. And, as time went by, he became more pessimistic about the environment. In 1977, Cousteau and the Calypso divers returned to Veyron. In only three decades, the sea floor has become a desert. Bleak as the surface of some barren planet. In this submerged desolation, the water temperature seems to rise, burning our hands in spite of our gloves. Our eyes are burning. Tears pour down our faces, blurring our vision. The pain is unbearable. We have penetrated a zone of death, a region where no living thing can long survive. ABC dropped him because he was getting too dark. They didn't want him browbeating the audiences with these, uh, dismal stories. He was more strident, trying to convince people rather than just showing them. And I think he became somewhat cynical at that point in his life. Can you tell me what you think are your greatest accomplishments and your greatest phase? This is... This is impossible to answer because I am not interested in analyzing myself. Why haven't you? I am not interested in myself once and for all. I am interested in the world outside me. My world inside is nothing for me. I keep thinking of a day that we spent together. We were working on our book and he had flown to Paris to meet me. The people on the plane had formed a line in the aisle while they awaited his autograph. And he said, "I spend every day, all day long going to meetings, "doing films, doing research, and the only thing they want "is a piece of paper with the name Jacques Cousteau. "And that's what they are going to enshrine." And he got more and more angry about it. I think the two of us were needing to have a new life, when we met. But in my mind and in his mind... it was not linked with anything romantic. I was 31, and I was a diver. So at that time, it was just about diving. We had organized, what we called at the time, Involvement Day in Houston. And I went diving with a club, and she was there. And I thought she was an interesting girl. At that time, she had a brilliant career at Air France, in charge of diplomatic travels for the French government. I think what Jacques wanted the most probably at that time was to have a place with a family. Not that he didn't have a family before, but because of the kind of life he had, he was never two minutes in the same place. His wife was on the boat. And the kids were in boarding school. And him, he was traveling everywhere, so there was no family, what we call "foyer," in French. It's a place where the family goes together, regularly. Home. He needed to have that. We knew a little bit about his relationship with Francine. And Cousteau, during that time, he had two children with her. But we never talked about them. But everyone knew. And I think Simone knew too. "The last time we had dinner together, "I knew she was not well. "But I had no idea what was wrong with her. "She had made the doctor promise not to tell me, "so as not to disturb my work". Calypso has given me everything. No man in the world could ever offer me what this vessel has. This boat is my paradise. And it's a wonder to pass my hand over the hull. To breathe its paint. To feel its vibrations. Its soul, the only reason for my being alive. Jacques never explained to anybody our private life. But he was getting worried that if anything happened to him, we would not be protected. So that was the reason we were married so early after his first wife died. When Francine married Jacques, I don't think that the French were shocked or cared. What mattered to them was what is Cousteau accomplishing. Francine started writing the narration for his films. And helping him to lead The Cousteau Society. And he said that their kids gave him a new beginning. And he said that even though he knew he was at the end of his life, he wasn't finished yet. Antarctica, it of course is the remote region at the center of a fierce international debate this morning. Should the majestic continent forever remain untouched underneath the ice? Or in a world of diminishing resources, should Antarctica be tapped for oil and precious minerals? You've said the survival of Antarctica, um, and the survival of the human race are linked. Is that alarmist, or explain how that would be? Yes, the science today, understands much better the role of the Antarctic system in the making of our own climates all over the world. The combination of industrialization and deforestation have increased the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, triggering a dangerous warming up of our planet. The Antarctic, this mass of ice, 90% of the ice of the world, governs the climate even in the United States or Europe in the northern hemisphere. If we touch Antarctica with industry, with explosions and et cetera, we don't know what can happen. And we may bring about famines in Africa, and even droughts in the United States. Because we now understand that our globe is just one single thermodynamic machine, that it works simply with a heat source from the sun, and a cold source from Antarctica. And we must not touch it. I decided to start a petition, to put pressure on the industry leaders and the politicians. Because they will not do it by their own incentive. It has to be under pressure. Now recently, I even had an opportunity to tell our story to the President of the United States, and I think that he was very receptive to what we said. Jacques Cousteau has forced a change of policy towards Antarctica, against mining or any exploitation of resources there. Twenty-six nations agreed to leave Antarctica untouched for at least 50 years. Distinguished ladies and gentleman, it is my privilege to talk to you in the most important conference on the environment that has ever been imagined. The biggest summit meeting ever has finally begun. The Earth Summit as it's called. Representatives of 170 nations have a very tall order, how to prevent making the Earth an unlivable place. Among the thousands who are taking part in the Earth Summit, one man can claim to have molded public opinion even before this conference began. Jacques Cousteau's enthusiasm, his scholarship, and his reach toward ordinary people have motivated pressure groups and governments alike. At the age of 80, he can take no little credit for bringing the Earth Summit into being. He says he's optimistic about the outcome of this conference, but warned of continuing threats to the world's environment. Non-renewable resources are depleted. Biodiversity shrinks to alarming levels. Energy is in unreasonable demand. And above all, the melting of glaciers and of ice caps, and catastrophic rise of the ocean levels, has already begun. But listen to this, all the people of the world, the beginning of everything is in Rio. For the first time, the immense majority of the leaders, they have promised beautiful things. All of them. Now we have to force them to transform these words into acts. Captain, are you optimistic about the way that nations are going to handle this resource of ours? I was asked this question very often and I ask myself this question. When I reason, I put things together, I am optimistic because I have a great faith in human beings and I believe that someday people are going to revolt and begin to care.
