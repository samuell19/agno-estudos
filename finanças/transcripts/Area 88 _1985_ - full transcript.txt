(dramatic music) (tanks rumbling) - [Man] Bandit at 10 o'clock! Bring us around! (gun firing) (screams) (dramatic music) - [Shin] Calling HQ, Area 88. The insurgent tank columns are moving north from Southern Division .3 bravo. This is zero-zero section, Shin Kazama. Can't tell if I'm getting through. Happens all the time. Well, nobody better go near my targets. (guns firing) That's $6,000 worth. Runway in sight. Main wing at seven degrees. Forward slats open. Flaps at 30 degrees. Air brakes set. Landing gear down.

Lone samurai battles for tomorrow on the burning sands. Picture perfect. - [Shin] You're also Japanese. - Don't get many of us around here, do you? The name's Goh Mutsuki, Tokyo News Service. - Mutsuki? - Yeah. You can just call me Rocky. - Could you stop? I don't like my picture being taken. - Give me a break, man. I'm just doing my job. - Well then, there's some better shots for you, Rocky. (dramatic music) - My god, it's on fire! - That's Gret's Skyhawk. (sirens blaring) (coughing) - Put it out, move it! McCoy, where's McCoy? - Right here. - They hit my canopy and I got a piece of shrapnel in my helmet! (laughs) - Alcohol, here. - All right! Gotta take care of this body of mine. - Treat it right and it'll last you a lifetime. - (groans) Yow, it stings! Better than my hair tonic. - Catch. - Fill 'er up, I'm going out again. This place is crawling with tanks. - They just finished putting the fire out and he's going back up again? (plane engine humming) (wheel cracking) (plane crashing) - [Bucksy] Piece of crap! I make it all the way back and the plane's down. - (laughs) You suck, Bucksy. - Lousy amateur. - [Gret] Your plane's more important than your life. - Shut up, you dumb hairy fat slob. - Bucksy, the plane's history. - Oh! Great, I only bought it a month ago. (laughs) - I've seen military bases in Vietnam and Africa, but this one is nuts. - You think it's weird, huh? This is a normal day for us. (slow music) Two years, three months to go. Two years. (water pouring) (shouts) (glass smashing) It's too long, it's just too long! Can't stand it! I don't wanna kill anymore. I wanna go home to Japan. I wanna get back still alive. - [Runners] Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. Hup, two, three, four. - You've both shown impressive results. There's nothing more our flight school can teach you. What you need now is more practice and experience and I hope you'll soon be flying all over the world. (gentle music) - Ryoko. Day after tomorrow, I'll be back in Japan. - Hey Shin, what you up to, old buddy? Bet you can't wait to get back home to Japan and see your little Ryoko, huh? - Well. - You lucky stiff. Stealing the heart of the daughter of the president of Yamato Airlines? Man, you're rising straight to the top. - Kanzaki, it's not like that. - [Kanzaki] It's a joke. - We haven't even talked about marriage yet. All I'm interested in right now is flying. - That's the great thing about you, Shin. No grand ambitions at all. Now me, on the other hand, I'd do anything to get ahead. - [Shin] I like your spirit of competition. - Anyway, we're set to get great jobs as pilots with YAL. Right, buddy? Now let's go out and party! - Drink till we drop! I'm flying! - [Kanzaki] On to the next bar. - Beer, whiskey, bring 'em on! The day after tomorrow, it's adieu Paris! - Hey, Shin. Wake up and sign this. - Let me sleep. - You can sleep all you want after you sign it. It's our overnight pass, just sign it. - Overnight pass? - We're pulling an all nighter, right? (dramatic music) (glass crashing) Good boy. So long, Shin. (gasps) - [Man] Hey, wake up. - Huh? - Shin Kazama. That right? - Who are you? - Come with us. Now, please. - You signed the contract with us. - Contract? You've got the wrong guy. I'm an overseas trainee for Yamato Airlines. - As of midnight, you resigned from Yamato Airlines and signed on with the mercenary air force of Arslan. - No way. I never signed. - Your signature, correct? According to this agreement, for the next three years... - You are committed to military service to the Kingdom of Arslan. - You guys are nuts! (grunts) - Mr. Kazama, you prefer to be shot as a deserter? - But I don't remember joining a mercenary air for... - [Kanzaki] Shin, it's an overnight pass. Just sign it. Sign it. Sign it. - Kanzaki! Why? Why? Why? (knocking) - Hi, I heard you outside. Can I come in? - Yeah. - What's with you? - [Shin] Nothing. - It's a Nikon. Make you homesick? - Kinda. Tell me, tell me about Japan. What's it like now? - Japan, huh? I haven't been back there for three years. I had offices in England. All my assignments have been in Europe. - I see. - Your folks in Japan? - No. - [Goh] Overseas? - I never had a family. I never even... I've never even seen my own mother. - Oh. Hey, I'm sorry to bring it up. - Talking to another Japanese guy, it really helps. - Rocky. I'm Lieutenant Colonel Saki Vashutal of the Royal Arslan Air Force. - And commander of this base. How do you do? - What brings a Japanese reporter out here? - To cover the world's only mercenary air force. And I heard there was a Japanese pilot here. - Yes, Shin Kazama? - Ah, so you've met him. - Rocky, you can pursue your story but this is Satan's front line. I cannot guarantee your safety here. - Roger. - [Saki] If you need anything, go to McCoy's warehouse. He should have anything you need. - He's even got film? - From tissue paper to nuclear warheads. Anything. (plane engine humming) - [Goh] Mr. McCoy? - Oh, the reporter. I thought you would come. - Huh? - Private joke. - Can I get 50 rolls of 35 millimeter Tri-X? - No problem. - [Man] I thought that reporters carried their own film. - Who are you? - Mick Simon, nice to meet you. Oh, so you're the bashful type, huh? - During the accident yesterday, I left my film bag out in the hot sun. 200 rolls of film, poof! You know? - Mistakes out here can kill ya. - You know that guy Shin Kazama? - Yeah, what about him? - I can't figure him out. I've been around soldiers. I've seen lots of battlefields. But that guy's different. He doesn't have the eyes of a soldier. - You're a soft one, boyo. He isn't like Mick here. He doesn't fight 'cause he wants to. - You know something about him? - Everyone has a story around here, but no one likes to talk about it. - I can imagine. - Your film. - Thanks. - Come back anytime. I have 300 more rolls. - [Goh] You're a lifesaver, pops. - Let's see, 50 rolls at $4-- - Hey, since when are you so nice to outsiders? - Since when? I'm the one who put his bag out in the sun. Made a nice little profit there too. (laughs) - Huh. (plane engines humming) - New recruits flying in formation, no less. - BAC Lightnings. The old planes are called into service again. (dramatic music) Probably ran out of work in Africa. (camera clicking) - Hey, stop it! - Yeah, this ain't a freak show. - Hey man, I smash that stupid camera. - What the? - Cool it. You seen Shin? - He's out on a sortie in the Northeast Division. Hasn't gotten back yet. - What do you mean, pops? - Yeah, he went out on a solo mission late last night. - He's amazing. You could learn a lesson from him, Mick. - Hey, Saki. What's the idea with Shin? I really don't understand it. How can you let him go out so much? - Now you listen to me, Mick. These pilots, they're the ones who choose the missions that they fly. It isn't up to me. - That's not fair. - The only possible way you can get out of Area 88 is three years of service, you can earn $1.5 million, or you can desert. (dramatic music) And I believe Shin is getting close to earning his 1.5. (guns firing) (screams) - [Shin] Sunset. All I can see is the color of blood. (sighs) Okay, finished. - The engine's just fine. I guess we're done. - Should we get the chief to inspect this? (Kanzaki sighs) I'll get him. - There you are! I've been looking for you. Hurry up. And carry these bags over to the plane. - Uh. (grunts) - You know, they should be put on board. - Huh? Yes ma'am. - [Man] Ryoko. - Daddy! - My personal assistant hasn't shown up. - What? But... - Uh, I'm Trainee Kazama, a flight student here. - Oh, I beg your pardon. I didn't realize. - Forgive my daughter. I'm Tsugumo of Yamato Airlines. (upbeat music) (screaming) - Are you scared, Shin? - My heart is doing somersaults! - And you want to be a jet pilot. They're much faster than this. - It feels different in a cockpit. (Ryoko laughs) Ryoko, my sweet angel. (plane engines humming) (guns firing) (dramatic music) I'm no longer the man you knew. I'm a devil engulfed in blood and forged from hatred! - Hey, Shin! Still alive? Good. Say, interested in a deal? Got some cheap sidewinders for you. - Pops, you keep selling arms, you're gonna end up in Hades. - This is Area 88, kid. This is Hades. There's no place worse. - Yeah, that's true. How much for the missiles? - Good lad! 50 shots for $1,000. - That is cheap. Are you sure they're not defects? - How can you say that? Have I ever sold you a missile that didn't fly? - [Boris] You've sold a few that don't explode. - Boris, mind your own business. - Pops, let's just forget we ever had this conversation. - But Shin! Righteous fool. Why'd you go and do that? - We're risking our lives every single day. A faulty missile can mean death, pops. - Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. Is it true he can't sleep without the lights on? - They say he's afraid that someday the dark will swallow him up. - Afraid, you say? Tough wanker like that, afraid? (laughs) (creaking) - And now for your next target. Southern Division .2 Charlie, surface to air missile base. - Hey, that's right in the devil's mouth! - You get showered with missiles if you get anywhere near that thing. - Tomorrow afternoon, the Arslan Air Force will launch an attack. In order to make sure that we minimize our losses, the base will have to be eliminated. - Huh, so we get fragged to protect the royal flyboys. - We always get the dirty jobs. - You are all being paid by us to be mercenary airmen. Don't forget that. Any questions? You leave in two hours. Volunteers, step up. Pay for this mission will be doubled to 20,000. (upbeat music) (camera clicking) - Hey, make sure you get good shots of us. We may not be coming back. - Well, I'll send 'em to your folks then. - [Shin] Sunset. 20, 30 hours. Let's go. (engine revving) - [Man] Controller Blue One, you're cleared for takeoff. (plane engines humming) Blue Two, taxi out, takeoff. - [Mick] Shin, you think they'll send up any fighters? - [Shin] Maybe. Our target's the supply depot for the SAM site. - [Boris] Usually you don't need fighters if you have SAMs. - [Man] We're almost in enemy air space. Drop down to avoid the missiles. - [Man] Who's telling me how to fly? (missiles booming) Target in sight. Moving in on the deck. That big depot's all mine, all mine! - [Man] Like hell. That prize money's going to me. Attack! (siren blaring) - [Man] Bandits on the deck, coming in supersonic. - Very impressive. Must be those merc pilots. No matter, they don't stand a chance! - Range 10, five. - Now release the fang! (dramatic music) (explosions booming) - There's two bandits in the perimeter, closing fast. They've penetrated the fang. - [Man] What? (missiles booming) (crashing) - [Shin] Got it! - [Boris] Great flying, Shin. Folding the wings in like that to get through. - [Shin] You too, boss. - [Boris] It's a good thing we both knew that the FAD can fly even with the wing tips folded up. Mick, you were covering us up there. - [Mick] You got the big prize and I was left swatting flies. - [Boris] I see, so that's why we weren't attacked while helplessly flying with our wings folded. - [Mick] Uh huh. I think that prize money should be split three ways. - [Boris] No, it'll be split two ways. - [Mick] What? - [Shin] Boris! If Mick hadn't covered us, we... Come in, Boris. - [Mick] Forget it, Shin. That's the kind of guy he is. I don't need any handouts from him. - [Shin] Neither do I. Boris, take my share too. (Boris laughs) - Man, you guys sure jump to conclusions. When I said two ways, (groans) I meant between you two guys. - [Shin] Boris. - Sorry fellas, I think I caught a couple of slugs through the air intake. Real friends are good to have, especially battlefield friends. You don't make that many real friends in your life. But you know the truth is, in war, you always end up losing your friends. It always hurts. That's why I don't like to make new friends. When I turn out the lights, I see my old pals appear. One by one, seeming to say "Hey, Boris, how are you?" (groans) I'll be joining them now in peaceful rest at last. - Boris, pull up! - [Boris] Shin, turn out the lights in my room when you get back. - Boris. (slow music) - Job well done. Destroying the base has cut their supply lines and forced them to pull their front line back as planned. 14 fighters went out. Only you two made it back. Get some rest before your next mission. - That cold bastard! Just look at how many guys bought it on this one. - That's all Boris had? - [Man] Yeah, and he doesn't have any next of kin. It'll just go to HQ for storage. (camera clicking) - Stop it! - Huh? (sighs) - Good night, Boris. - Look, Shin, what happened back there-- - Forget it. It's Bucksy. He's waiting for all of his pals to come back. - They won't, will they? What kind of lives did they live, all of those men who died? - We get all sorts here. Soldiers, priests, executives, boxers, and even the occasional mafia don. No one ever says why, no one even asks, but we all have reasons for being here. - And what about you, Shin? - I wonder if it's this hot in Tokyo. (horn blaring) - So you wanted to see me? - Can I help you? - Coffee please. - Coming up, miss. - Ryoko, come on. Haven't you given up on Shin yet? It's been two years. You stay sad all the time, you'll get sick. - So that's it. That really isn't any of your business. - I think it is my business. Shin was one of my best friends. Still in all, there were times I just couldn't figure him out. - Oh? Well, I find you much more of a mystery. - Well, that's because you don't pay enough attention to me. - Meaning what? - Meaning a man like that could never have made you happy. - A man like what? - I... - Here you go. Enjoy. - Mr. Kanzaki, happiness for a woman is to find a man who she can trust and be trusted by. I still trust Shin. - Shin? You don't even know if he's still alive. - I can't believe it! How can you say that? If you'll excuse me. - [Kanzaki] But-- - I won't be in your debt, not even for a cup of coffee. - [Kanzaki] How dare you? Just wait. I'll see you groveling at my feet, begging for forgiveness. - Pops, load some sidewinders on my pylons, will ya? - Sure thing. Oh, Mick, have you heard? - [Mick] What? - Shin only needs $20,000 to get his 1.5. - Huh? When did he pile up so much? - All he needs is five more planes to get $20,000. - And kill five more men. So I guess he'll be getting out of here real soon. - If he stays alive till then. (laughs) - Pops, you really are going to hell, aren't you? (guns firing) (explosion booming) - [Shin] One more hit. Just one and I'll have my 1.5. Ryoko, I'm coming home. I'm coming home to you. Don't hate me. You're my last. After this, I'll never kill another man, so please, please forgive me. Empty! (dramatic music) (explosion booming) (plane engine whining) - Hey, that's Shin's crusader. - Christ! (sirens blaring) (plane crashing) Shin! (sirens wailing) (tires squealing) - (sighs) Made it. How long will it take you to repair it? - Sorry, son. Be quicker to buy a new one. Another one like this will cost at least $500,000. - $500,000, and all because I wanted to make 20,000. - Take it easy, man. You should be thankful. At least you're still alive. - Do you know how many people I'll have to kill to earn 500,000? - Mr. Kazama, this helmet protects your life. - Mind your own business and worry about your own lives. - Of all the rotten luck. (slow music) Hm, where have I seen those three? - [Shin] I'm going home. Back to Japan. Back to Ryoko. I'll desert. Can't stand it anymore. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The Middle East. An inferno of war where only by the grace of Allah can one survive. We are the daredevil mercenary air force. - [Shin] Ryoko. I'm coming home. Back to Japan. (canteen thuds) (guns firing) (helicopters whirring) (screams) - Hey, I really don't know who or what you left behind in Tokyo, Shin, but never forget this. You're a trained expert killer now too. (guns firing) - Yeah, trained expert killer. Don't you think I know that? That's why I wanna get outta here! - It's about your getting married. - Married? - I always thought that either Kazama or Kanzaki would become your husband. But Kazama is no longer with us. - I'd like you to have someone killed for me. His name is Shin Kazama. He's a commander in Area 88. (slow music) - [Narrator] We've abandoned our past and sold our souls to the devil. Men who have become wolves who battle in the sky. Will Shin Kazama, betrayed by his trusted friend and cast into flames, live to return to Japan? Will he be reunited with his beloved Ryoko? The power-hungry Kanzaki's evil influence even now reaches out to touch Shin and Ryoko. - [Shin] Ryoko!
