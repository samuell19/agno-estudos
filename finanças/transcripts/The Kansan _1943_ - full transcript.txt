Jesse James, Jesse James, Jesse James. Jesse James. Jason, your rifle. Jeff. Who is that man? Name's Bonniwell. He's been in town a few days. He's no tenderfoot. They say he's the best shot in the territory, Mr. Barat. Doctor? Is he still alive? He's in bad shape. He's been nicked at least four times. Well, get him in the hospital right away. Come on, boys. I never knew you were the grateful type, Steve. He saved my bank, didn't he? There, Sam. Thanks, Miss Sager. I expect to see you out of here this week. Hello, Walter. Arm better? Don't seem to bother me much on the days you come to the hospital. I'll try to get here more often. Good morning, Mr. Bonniwell. Good morning. Feeling better? I'd feel a lot better if I could get a few things straight. You've been a sick man, much too sick to talk. You mean, you've been here before? You've been too busy fighting for your life to notice me. I'm Eleanor Sager. There, pulse increasing. I best speak to the doctor. Here, I'm alright. Say, what's that noise outside? I believe they're celebrating. Celebrating what? The election of the new marshal. Think he's popular enough? Say, did they say Bonniwell? Apparently, John Bonniwell has just been elected marshal of Broken Lance. But that's me. I'm John Bonniwell. Congratulations. Well, I don't understand, Miss Sager. I was hit and. Well, well, Marshal, hardiest congratulations. Your election was unanimous. It may interest you to know that I haven't the slightest idea what this is all about. It was wonderful, the way that people of Broken Lance wrote in your name. Would it be asking too much to inquire just who you are? Of course, I forgot you're a stranger. I'm Josh Hudkins. I'm mayor of Broken Lance. And this is Steve Barat, our leading citizen. Glad to see you've almost recovered, Bonniwell. Well, thanks, but I still don't know what this is all about. Why don't you ask Steve? Do you mean that you had me brought here to this hospital? Not only had you brought here, but sent for the best doctor in Kansas, And had nurses in attendance day and night. Thank you, Mr. Barat. I guess I'm under pretty deep obligations to you. Not at all. It was my bank the James boys were headed for. I think Mr. Bonniwell's had enough excitement for one day. Of course. Now, come and see me as soon as you're up, Marshal. Be in to see you again, Bonniwell. Goodbye, Mr. Bonniwell. Too bad it wasn't the Hatton gang instead of the James boys that tried to hold up the bank. You might've been able to get even with 'em. Even with 'em, why? After the way they murdered your brother. Why, who told you about that? Ah, we know a lot about you. Captain in the Civil War. Major Pyle and the Pike's Peak gold rush. Then, lost it all when the Hatton gang cleaned you out. Thought your outfit and you'd go to Oregon. And the James boys. That sort of brings things up to date, doesn't it? Oh, yes. Morning, Barat. This is the new marshal? Shake hands with Ed Gilbert, editor of our local paper. How are ya? Your election was a splendid thing for us in Broken Lance, Mr. Bonniwell. It was? Yes, I'd like to get your views on conditions around here. Well, I'll be able to give you a very definite statement after I see the mayor. Fine, thank you. Mayor. Well, hello, Steve. Well, come in, Marshal, come in. I'm glad to see you. Sit right down. I'll get to the point at once. Why was I elected marshal in this town? Well, after the stand you put up against the James boys. That's no reason for electing me without my consent. Surely you must know the people and their quest for a responsible and practical law enforcement officer. Oh, I know exactly. They usually pick someone already chosen by the politicians. I'm afraid you have no perception of your popularity. If it'll make you feel any better, I had something to do with your election. You? As a banker, people naturally ask my opinion. I recommended you. Does that help clear it up? I'm afraid not. Well, then, let me make it plainer. I'm a businessman interested in profit. But there can't be any unless the town is run efficiently, especially in the administration of the law. And Broken Lance is the fastest growing little town in Kansas. Mr. Barat, I appreciate your confidence in me and your many kindnesses, but I was on my way to Oregon when the altercation with the James gang started, and I'm still going. You'd better think it over. There's a great opportunity here. Well, that's what I hear about Oregon. Goodbye, Mr. Barat, Mayor. Well. Funny, I didn't figure it would turn out that way. Hello, Marshal. I'd like to have a look at a room. You? You're the ah? I'm the landlady. Well, how nice. I hope to get a vacant room. Will it be just 'til you get located, or will this be your permanent headquarters? Well, I don't know. You see. If you decide to live here, we would do all we can to make you comfortable. Well, I'm sure of that, but you see. And I don't mind telling you that we're glad to have someone in authority around here. We need you pretty badly, Mr. Bonniwell. You really think I could help? After the sample you gave us, I'm sure of it. Well, let's have a look at a room, one that I can have permanently. I'll show it to you myself. You know, this is the only room with running water. Really? Well, where's your luggage? Well, it's still at the hospital. Well, as soon as Bones comes back, Bones is our man. I'll have him take care of it. Hello, Jeff. Hello, Eleanor. Special attention for the new marshal, huh? I see. I'm Jeff Barat. Well, how are ya? I think I met your brother. Steve? Nice fellow on a hot day if you need a little cooling off. Don't pay any attention to anything he says. Just between us, that advice comes straight from the heart. Well, I'll remember that. Goodbye, Jeff. By the way, when you see your brother, will you tell him that I've reconsidered that proposition we were discussing? Proposition? He'll understand. You know, the mistake we made was in pulling that last job. Now, it's getting too hot around here for comfort. I never heard of you refusin' a cut. Hi, Jim. What's it worth to you if I tell you about a hot spot where you and Nash can write your own ticket. I'll pay off after I decide your not talking through your hat. Oh, that's alright with me. Remember John Bonniwell? I believe I do. Jesse James got him over in Broken Lance Canyon. That's what a lot of people think. But I was talkin' to a fella just drifted in from there yesterday. What about it? Well, that nice, fat, little town nursed Bonniwell back to life and elected him marshal. Bonniwell marshal? Good, we put the Indian sign on him once. We can swing any town by the heels where he's marshal. Where is this place? I'll get a map. Good mornin', Miss Sager. Good morning. Yes, ma'am, Miss Ellie? It's eight o'clock, Bones. Go and wake Mr. Bonniwell. Yes, ma'am. Did you say Mr. Bonniwell? Yes, Bones. You mean the Mr. Bonniwell that had it out with the James boys? There's no other Mr. Bonniwell in this hotel that I know of. The one that shoots and never misses. Yes, he wanted to be called at eight o'clock. Maybe he do, Miss Ellie, but he didn't say for me to call him. Why, Bones, you're not afraid of John Bonniwell, are you? Oh, no, I ain't afraid, just careful. Hello, Bones. Good morning. Good morning. Why, Jeff Barat, I didn't know you were ever up before noon. And look what it does to me. Pouches under my eyes, no ambition. Say, are you always so pretty this early in the morning? You didn't get up at this hour to say nice things to me, Jeff. Where are you heading? Oh, that way. Bonniwell up yet? No, and I must call him. Look, wouldn't it be nice if I stayed here, and you awakened me early every morning. This is a respectable hotel. Cattlemen, railroaders, peace marshals. No gamblers. No fun. Never mind. - After we're married. - When? When I get you to say yes. I haven't really said no, Jeff. - Does that mean? - No. For just one second, I thought that fate had awakened me at this unearthly hour for a reason. I have a hotel to run. You'd have a lot more fun running me. And a lot harder work. I'm looking for a man who'll stay home nights. If you find one, I'll fill him so full of holes. Good morning. Oh, Mr. Bonniwell, your call. Well, that's quite alright. I was afraid that easy life in a hospital had softened me up. Hi, Barat. No one can be very well at this time in the morning. Some coffee might help. The dining room's still open, gentlemen. That's for me. Come along, Bonniwell. Will you join us, Eleanor? I can't. I'm on duty. Come here, boy. What's the matter? Can't you hear? No, sir, I'm stone deaf. What does that sound like? That ain't no church bell. You're right. Get me a paper, will ya? Yes, sir. What's the matter with him? Looks like your reputation's gotten around, Mr. Bonniwell. You know, Miss Sager doesn't exactly seem like a western girl. As a matter of fact, she isn't. She and her father came here from the East and purchased this hotel. He died shortly after, and Eleanor decided to carry on. It seems rather strange, a girl like her running a hotel. Oh, it's perfectly safe. Everyone knows about us. I mean. I see. Are congratulations in order? Don't get me wrong. She hasn't said that. You know how girls are. It takes them a long while to make up their minds. Well, I wish you luck, Barat. Thanks. I'd say she's worth fighting for. She is. Here's your paper, sir. Oh, thanks. If I were you, I wouldn't take anything you read in that paper too seriously. Oh, it's like that, is it? Like that. How strong do you feel this morning? Well, strong enough. Strong enough to take a ride with me? It might be a good idea to get around and meet some people. You will. Two bits a breeze, boys. Ain't worth it. Everybody pays. Thems the rules. Well, we don't go by rules. And tell the Barats we're through payin'. They wouldn't pay, Marshal. Shot my sign full of holes and was gonna ride across anyhow. Well, everyone makes mistakes, Pop. We heard Steve Barat had an old gunhand. How much is your cut? They'll pay you now, Pop. Thank you, Marshal. It would've been took out of my salary if they got away with it. Who owns this bridge? Why Steve Barat, of course. Everyone pay to cross it? That's the rule. Well, I guess we'd better step along. I understand that all these cattle are being driven to the railroad now. There's thousands moving north. She'll save a week drivin' to Broken Lance instead of Abilene or Dodge. Broken Lance must be a pretty valuable town. It is. Kansas Pacific Railroad put it on the map. See, we're 100 miles closer to Texas than any other town. Probably be a lot of Texas men in town tonight. There will be. I'd like you to meet a few of 'em in advance. I'd like to. What's the idea of these gates? You can't block me from the railroad. I've driven over 1000 miles. What about it? Can't you read? There ain't no sign gonna stop me. Come on, boys. Hey, wait a minute. Alright, alright, that's plenty. Break it up, boys. Break it up, break it up. Hold it. What's goin' on here? Well, jumpin' Jehosophat, John Bonniwell. Well, Tom Wagoner, you old son of a coyote. So, that's where you've been, in Texas. How were they in Colorado, you old polecat? See, you know, you still owe me a drink. And if you had gone to Texas with me, you'd have been rich by now. Hey, a marshal's star, huh? I got talked into something. Well, they couldn't have made a better choice. Say, where's your calaboose? We'll help you lock up these sun fishin' buzzards here. Why, what'd they do? Tryin' to keep me from comin' through here with my cattle. Did you ever hear of anything so high-handed? You the new marshal? That's right. These men assaulted us. Assaulted nothin'. We was wailin' the daylights out of 'em. Who started all the rumpus? They wouldn't pay the tax to cross this private land. What kind of a tax? Dollar a head. That's the rate they all pay unless they wanna drive on west to Abilene. Why, that's highway robbery. It'd cost me $5000. Who owns this land? Steve Barat. He knows we've got a right to go cross country. John, move this guard outta here. Well, I'd like to, but unfortunately, Barat has the law on his side. You're the law. Oh, no, I'm just here to enforce it. You ain't linin' up against me, are ya? You know better than that. But you ain't lettin' me through. Look, Tom, why don't you camp here for tonight until I have a talk with the owner of this land. That's fair enough, isn't it? If you say so, John, but I don't like it. Cat, we'll hold 'em here tonight. Get off of that hat, will ya? Anything else you wanna see? I've seen enough for one day. Thank you, Mrs. Wilson, for your new account. Good day, sir. Good day. Hello, Bonniwell. A few things I'd like to ask you, Mr. Barat. Why, of course. Come in. Have a chair. Thank you. Jeff find you this morning? Just got back. Have a cigar? No. Well, what do you think of our setup? Well, what I think's unimportant. But I'm curious about one thing. Why did you have me elected marshal? I think the answer is obvious. We need a strong hand to handle with a certain element in this town refuses to obey the law. In other words, you expect me to help you and your brother to make a cleanup. Not at all. My brother is not a partner in this enterprise. I own Broken Lance. Every unsold lot, most of the business, and all the land that surrounds the town. And I own it legally with deeds that'll stand up in any court. Now, you're sitting back to make a killing. Nobody need settle here, but if they do, it's your duty to see to it that they obey the law. I'm sorry, Barat, but I didn't deal myself into this game. You were elected in the manner prescribed by the statutes. And if you fail to fulfill your duty, I'm afraid I shall be the first to file a complaint in the courts. See, that's the sort of thing I've been referring to. Arrest those men. Take their guns away. Well, I guess it's your move, Marshal. Come on out, or we'll come in and get ya. And bring out some change, mostly two-bit pieces. Well, are you comin' out, you rabbit? Get out and disarm them. Drive them away. It looks to me as though they want to see you. I'm no gunfighter. What do you think you were hired for? I'm beginning to find out. Why, you're not the one. You're right. I'm not the man you want. But you'll do. Put your gun away. Take them right to the calaboose, Bonniwell. I'll handle this my way unless you wanna take my hand. No, no, no, not at all. Come on, Marshal, move 'em away. I'll move 'em. I guess Tom Waggoner had you all wrong, Bonniwell. Get this man to the hospital. Yeah, who's gonna pay for it. I am. There is not room for crooks in this town. They should be all locked up in jail. Maybe they will be before this is over. # Oh oh hushabye # # Go to sleep, my doggies # # Just the breeze gently stir # # Nothin' bad comes to harm my doggies # # While I sing the lullaby of the herd # Malachy told me what you done for Kelso, and I want you to know I appreciate it, John. He's a mighty good rider. Oh, his problem was simple enough. It's what to do with the rest of the town that's worrying me. The way you tell it, this man Barat believes in throwin' his rope over everything in sight. Including me. At that rate, he'll own all of Kansas in a year. And legally. He's too smart to do it any other way. Reminds me of a jug-headed, local horse we was breakin' last year. It seemed like he knowed all the tricks. He'd just roll his eyes and back up and sit down the minute you walked toward him with a saddle. What'd you do? Shoot him? No, we cured him. How? We built a good fire, let him back up and sit down. Of course, he'd done a lot of extra eye rollin', but one treatment made a gentleman out of him. Maybe that's what we outta do with Barat. Build a fire and let him sit down in it. I'd like to light that fire. I got a hunch you're gonna, tonight. Howdy, boys. Well, I wasn't expectin' you tonight, Marshal. Well, I just wanted to drop around see if you had any trouble. Everything's quiet. Those Texas boys. Sounds like cattle movin'. And movin' fast, that's a stampede. Well, I don't wanna tell you boys what to do. You've got your orders, but I'm gettin' out of here. We gotta keep those cattle from gettin' past that fence. I wish ya luck. Maybe this fence will hold. Maybe it won't. # When Johnny come marching home again, hurrah, hurrah # # We'll give him a hearty welcome then, hurrah, hurrah # # The men will cheer, the boys will shout # # The ladies, they will all turn out # # We'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home # # When Johnny comes marching home again, hurrah, hurrah # # We'll give him a hearty welcome then, hurrah, hurrah # # The men will cheer, the boys will shout # # The ladies, they will all turn out # # We'll all feel gay when Johnny comes marching home # Pretty lucky tonight, huh, Marshal? You might say tonight's my night to howl. Yeah, what do you do? Over $10. Ed? I'd like to see you in private, Marshal. Oh, you don't wanna take me away when I'm winning, do ya? I don't like to interrupt your card game, but you have a duty to perform. You're right. I have to draw three cards. I'll take one. I'll have two. I'll take one. Two. I want you to arrest Tom Waggoner. Oh, is Tom in town? Maybe we'd better defer this, Marshal. Not unless you're gonna call. I'll bet $100. You heard what I said. Get out there. Oh, you must have a strong hand, Bonniwell. I have. In that case, I'll just raise you one. If this is your idea of a joke, Bonniwell. I never joke when I'm playing cards. I'll just raise you another 100. But Wagner had his cattle driven across my land without the payment of a fee. That's not the way I heard it. What happened? Stampede. Well, I'll call ya. Three aces. Too strong for me, Marshal. And, now, Mr. Barat, what are the charges against Tom Wagner? He had no right to take his cattle across my land without paying. You know, for a smart man, you surprise me. Did you ever try telling a stampeding steer that he didn't have the right to go any place? Alright, I'll settle this matter in court. I'll sue Tom Waggoner. Might be a sensible idea. I think an honest jury in this town might like to sit in judgment of this case. Oh, I must've fallen asleep. Sorry, it's so late I thought I'd have to get in through the window. Well, I always wait up until the last guest comes in, and you're not the last. May I wait up with you? Oh, please do. Tell me, how long have you been in Broken Lance? About a year. Ever have any trouble? Trouble? What do you mean? Well, you seem to know the Barats pretty well. A lot of people have had trouble with 'em. Yes, I know. Steve Barat's money mad. He came here from New York. Heard people are easier to handle in Broken Lance. I wonder what he did in New York. He was a banker, I think, or a broker. And his brother? Oh, Jeff's different. As unreliable as the weather. And as unpredictable. Yes, I suppose so. Nothing seems to worry him. I like Jeff. I don't blame ya. I like Jeff myself. I wonder what he does for a living. Steve probably makes enough for them both. But here I am, going on talking. I'll get your key. You need some rest. Bones, what's the matter? Miss Ellie, Miss Ellie I seen 'em. I seen 'em. Who? The Hatton gang. They just rolled into town. Who did you know it was the Hattons? I heard some people talkin' to 'em, when they was walkin' into the Golden Prairie Saloon. It was the Hattons who? Yes, they're old friends of mine. You say they went in the Golden Prairie, Bones? Yes, sir, just as broad as daylight and bold as brass. Bones. What does that sound like? That ain't no woodpecker peckin'. You're right. Thanks, Bones. Thank ya. Maybe I'd better look them up. Old friends deserve a welcome, don't ya think? Oh, you must be careful. Must I? They probably heard you're marshal here and came to make trouble. Probably. It won't accomplish anything for you to get hurt. Who said I was gonna get hurt? Please, at least promise me you'll wait until morning. Well, I was kinda hoping that maybe we could have breakfast together tomorrow morning. Alright, John, but please, won't? I'd better get them off my mind. Good night. What's your hurry there, Marshal? Hi, Marshal. Well, Tom, Malachy, how are ya, boys? Well, it's sort of late, but the boys wanted to celebrate a little. And I had kinda a notion myself. You know, there isn't anybody I'd rather see riding up right now, Tom. Hey, there wasn't any trouble about that stampede, was there? No trouble. You're gonna get sued, that's all. Well, I'll never forget what you've done for us, John. Anytime me and the boys can pull one out of the fire for you. Well, maybe you can, tonight. What's goin' on? You remember the Hattons? They're in there. Well, you can count on us, Marshal. Sure can. I hope I don't need ya, but if they're lookin' for trouble. They'll find it. Hey, boys? Pretty fair sort of town you got here, boys. Now, what'd you say your name was? I didn't say, but it's Hatton, Gil Hatton. Figure on stayin' awhile? That all depends, as a fella says. There's Bonniwell at the bar. Card? Deal me out a while. No shooting, Nash. This is my chance to get him the way I've always wanted to. What they say is true. He's wearin' a badge. Didn't lose any time, did you, Hatton? Wouldn't keep the boys and me away, Bonniwell. We figured any town where you was marshal it'd be duck soup for us. What's more we like it here. Well, that's too bad 'cause I'll give you 10 minutes to start back to Colorado. Oh, you aim to run us out of town? I'm aimin' to lock you up as undesirable characters if you're still here in 10 minutes. No iron there, brother. Just hands and feet. Bullseye. Thanks. That's our piano. Get away, sister. Oh, you get off. Hey, what's the big idea? Your 10 minutes are up, Hatton. I ain't had so much fun since you sat in what you got. Can we walk 'em or drag 'em? Well, it's just across the street, and your horses look tired. Now, you listen here, if you think you can start out the bar. Well, I guess you fellas how obliged to you I am. Why, shucks, what are friend for? Let's you and me have breakfast together, John. Well, make it dinner on me. 12 o'clock at the hotel, all of ya, huh? That's a deal. Let's get goin', Tom. Right. Well, thanks again, pal. So long, John. So long. So long, boys. Well, I thought you deserted us. I came over to see the Hatton outfit get tucked into bed. I wanna thank you for what you did tonight. I kinda figured you were on the other side. Yeah, lots of people do. Does that mean you don't see eye to eye with your brother? Not necessarily. Only sometimes I like to give a sucker an even break. Makes it more fun to trim him. In other words, you don't like to work behind a man's back, is that it? Yeah, something like that. Good night. Good night. Thanks again. Are you Tom Waggoner? That's my name. Bonniwell wants to see you at the hotel right away. What's the matter, more trouble? I wouldn't know. Just asked me to come at once. I'll be right with ya. I'll go along and see how Kelso's doin'. Good. George, break camp. We'll be headin' for Texas just as soon as I get back from town. Hope John ain't got into another mess of trouble. Slow us up gettin' away. Hope not. It's not my. Get outta here. I hope you're being made comfortable here. I should say I am. You know, I've had such a difficult time getting hired help. Thanks. You run this place like a big city hotel. Some day I expect to see Broken Lance grown up, and we all will have had a part in raising it. Good morning. Hello, Jeff. I hope I'm not intruding. Sit down. Thanks. Cup of coffee? No, thanks. Wasn't it wonderful about locking up the Hatton gang? It's not the Hattons that are worrying me. You're not thinking of my brother, are you? To tell you the truth, I think this town would be a lot better off without him. Why, Steve is practically the founder of Broken Lance. That's right. He invested his money, helped lay out the town. Someone has to do that sort of thing. Why did you say that? Ask Jeff. Well, he means that my brother is a businessman, interested in profits. I mean that your brother is squeezing this town dry. He owns everything in it except the people. He had a lot to do with electing you marshal. Ask Jeff the reason for that one too. Well, he figured that John would be able to handle the, well, the troublesome elements. He figured I'd keep 'em in line so the people wouldn't take the law into their own hands. Steve's never broken the law. There he is, mister. You lookin' for me, Malachy? Waggoner's been shot. Waggoner? What happened? They set a trap, and we were rode into it. I got away. Who set a trap? Hatton and Nash. Well, they couldn't. They're in jail. Waggoner's dead, and they killed him. I saw it. What are you gonna do? Plenty. Marshal, Marshal. I'm busy. This won't wait. I've got news. Well, I'll read about it in the paper. Well, that'll be too late. Hatton, Nash, and his whole gang were released early this morning on bail. Bail? Who put it up for them? Judge Larimore wouldn't say, but I thought you might be able to find out. Well, I will. My outfit's still waitin' in camp. Well, that's fine, in case we need 'em. Good to hear that. Come in, come in. Ah, good morning, Marshal. Why did you let the Hattons go? Well, I wasn't aware that such a decision was relevant to you. Never mind the legal talk. Why did you let them out? Now, look here, Bonniwell. I'm not in the habit of being questioned in this manner. But for your information, proper bonds were put up. Yes, who signed them? Why, ah. I did if you must know. And I attested them legally. You know, I suppose if they come up for trial at exactly 10 o'clock. I don't need anyone to remind me of my court calendar. Perhaps not. By the way, how much were those bonds for? Why, quite a sufficient amount. I think, ah, yes, $20,000. Then, for once this town is gonna make money on Steven Barat instead of the other way around. It's exactly five minutes of 10, and at 10 o'clock those bonds are forfeited. Don't worry. The Hattons will be here. Tom Waggoner's been killed. They're not gonna put in an appearance and face a murder trial. In that case, Steve, you have to up the 20,000. And if the money isn't paid, I'd be right within the letter of the law in asking for a writ of attachment on his holdings in the bank. Wouldn't I Judge Larimore? Why surely you wouldn't go to that length, Marshal? Wouldn't I? There must be some way out of this. Not while Bonniwell is marshal. It might have been better for all of us if he had gone to Oregon. What brings you here? Not a very hospitable greeting it seems to me. I'll be with you in a minute. I don't mind waiting. The bank is prospering, I trust? It generally means you're broke when you begin to worry about the bank's condition. It's certainly funny how astute you bankers are. How much? $5000. Ah, you're crazy. I run a bank, not a printing press. Where do you think I get my hands on so much money? Why, Stevie, I thought there was much more than that in the vault. The money in this bank belongs to the depositors. Aw, huh. What kind of a jam you get yourself in this time? Another gambling debt? What else? I lose at playing cards, and you lose at going bail - for a couple of. - Never mind about that. I'm afraid you'll have to help yourself this time. How badly do you need that money? Badly enough to get it before I leave. You wouldn't want Bonniwell to know some things that happened before you came here, would you? So, that's the lineup? You and Bonniwell? Aw, now you're rather overdoing that astuteness I spoke of, my dear brother. Bonniwell means nothing to me. As a matter of fact, I've got considerable reason to wish that he was on the other side of the world. But I need that money. And you wouldn't mind if Bonniwell were disgraced and thrown out of office? I'd laugh about it just as heartily as you but for an entirely different reason. Too bad Hatton didn't get him instead of Waggoner. However, there may still be time. Now, wait a minute. If that happened, I'd be the first one to warn him. You haven't quite gotten me straight yet, Stevie. I'm not a murderer. Some day your precious sense of honor's gonna send you to your grave. How'd you like $10,000? 10,000? Come closer and listen. I'm all ears, Steve. I'm sending $25,000 in cash out of here on a train that leaves for Kansas City at midnight. Well, holding up trains isn't exactly in my line. A clerk and an armed guard will take the money from the bank to the train. That's fine, Steve, fine, all except the armed guard. I can see to it that the gun is empty. Then, it shouldn't be very difficult for you to take the money away from them as they approach the station. Now, wait a minute. Let me get this straight. I take all the risk and get less than half the money? Is that it? What's wrong with that arrangement? It isn't even worth discussing. I'll tell you what I'll do though. I'll take the risk and the 25,000. Your plan to discredit Bonniwell succeeds, and you have the ammunition to start a recall proceeding. This the deal? Go ahead. You set it up. Ed, Gilbert. Howdy. I was hopin' you wouldn't come back alone. It looks like they skipped the country clean. We'll get 'em. I wanted to see you, Mr. Bonniwell, because you outta know what's goin' on. Shoot. There's talk around town that you're not able to run down the Hattons. I can imagine who started it. But I also wanted you to know there are quite a few of us who do understand just what's goin' on. Well, thank you, Mr. Gilbert. Now, I've seen Steven Barat destroy quite a few men he couldn't control. Then, why do you stand for him here? Because we've never had a man strong enough to fight for us. As long as I've been pushed out on a limb, maybe I'd better try and keep Barat from sawing it off. I sure hope you can. So long, Marshal. Ah, here's today's paper. Get 'em up. Give me the satchel. Marshal, the money satchel, he got away with it. I had $25,000 in a black satchel and was on my way to the train. Careful, he's got a gun. Hey, did a man pass you? Yeah. Was he carrying a satchel? It might have been a satchel he was carrying. He was goin' that way. Did you recognize him? It was too dark. Why, Jeff Barat. I thought these were your working hours. I left myself off early tonight. You wouldn't have a room to rent, would you lady? Oh, as a matter of fact, I have none. I'm full up. If you'd only let me know this morning. Well, I didn't figure on moving this morning. Can I check your bag, sir? No, thanks. This morning, I, ah, one second. Perhaps you had better put it away for me, Bones. Yes, sir. It will be quite safe. Busy lady, aren't you? The hotel won't run by itself. You saw him, did ya? Yep, and he was carrying a satchel alright. And he went right into the Sager House. Thank you. You stay here, Malachy. If I'm not back in 10 minutes. Sure. Hello there. Late again. Been in the saddle all day. I'm sorry about your friend, John. Yeah, it's too bad we didn't finish those fellows last night. Yes, it is too bad. No trace of 'em at all? No trace. Well, tomorrow's another day. And if I can help? Thanks. You're not in your usual game tonight, I see. No, Jeff reformed. He's giving up his eight hours and movin' into the hotel. Here's a check for your satchel, sir. Oh, thank you, sir. Must have been a kind of a heavy bag to carry, was it Bones? Oh, no, sir, it was a very small satchel. I told Jeff he should've let me know earlier, and I would've had a room for him. Well, he probably didn't know it himself until quite late. Did you just get in, Jeff? Oh, about half an hour ago. Why, Jeff, you just came in a few minutes before John. Yeah? Maybe she's right. Talking to you, I didn't notice. Well, I guess you didn't hear about the holdup of the bank messenger. The bank messenger? Happened about 20 minutes ago. The holdup man got away with a small satchel containing about $25,000 of the bank's funds. My brother's bank? Hmm. He'll probably expect you to do something about that, Marshal. Well, do you know who did it, John? I think I do. Tell me, did anyone identify the holdup man? I know who he is. John, are you sure, sure that you know? Yes, I'm sure. The question then becomes, what are you going to do about it? Well, there isn't any choice. So, John, you have to be very, very sure about a thing like that. I am sure. Well, how can we ever be sure of anything? Why, when, well, when Jeff came in, for instance, I noticed that he was carrying a small satchel. Yes? But it was such a small satchel, and, well, I said that it was hardly big enough for a toothbrush. And then, when he opened it and showed it to me, well, it was full of clothes too. You saw inside the satchel? Well, of course, John. So, you see, we never can be sure of anything, can we? Looks like you're wasting time, John. Perhaps I am. That was wonderful, darling. Oh, go away. But you? Go away, go away. Eleanor, I had to have that money. It was a debt of honor. And you saved me. Why can't we leave here? And go away somewhere else and start over again? I'll do anything. I'll give up everything just to try and make you happy. Why, you must care a little, or else you wouldn't have. Oh, you fool. Do you think it was you that I wanted to save? It was pretty stupid of me not to understand. I'll take that satchel now, Bones. Oh, yes, sir. Right here, sir. Thank you, sir. I guess Malachy and I got off on the wrong steer, boys. The holdup man hasn't had a chance to get very far. We'd better spread out and. Here's something that may interest you, Bonniwell. Where'd you get this? I stumbled across it. Maybe the holdup man thought it was too hot and had to drop it. Where'd you find it, Barat? Near the hotel. That's fine. I'll have to write an article for the paper about this. Congratulations, Barat. Well, me and the boys better get back to camp. We'll be around a few more days if you need us. You don't seem particularly pleased to get the money back. I'm not quite sure what to think yet. Well, I'll tell you, John, when I'm in a spot like that, I don't try to think. I just play my hand. Maybe you're luckier than I am. Yeah. Then again, maybe I'm not. So, the hero's come home. Yes, I came home. What happened? Lose your nerve? Not exactly. I heard how you accidentally found the money. Why did you give it to Bonniwell? I thought it would be a pleasant change to have an honest man in the family. You're a fool, Jeff. I seem to remember that you brought Bonniwell here. Well, I'm gonna get rid of him too. I had word from Gil Hatton tonight. He didn't offer to refund your bail money, did he? He offered to turn it into an investment. Liquidating Bonniwell? Any deal I make will pay adequate returns. I'll give you a piece of advice, my dear brother. Keep your insurance up. By the way, it still made out in my favor, isn't it? Mmm hmm. Good night. Good night, Steve. Hurry up, Bones. Yes, ma'am. Did you put the bacon in? Oh, yes. Morning. Good morning. Going somewhere? Aunt Sarah lives five miles out in the country. She hasn't been well, and I'm taking her some provisions. Won't you come along? I'd love to, but there's some things I should do. Don't you think you work hard enough to entitle you to a day's rest? Maybe I'd better accept before you change your mind. Good. Whoa, Duke. Bones? Yes? What's that sound like? That ain't no clock a tickin'. Whoa. Hello, Miss Eleanor. Hello, Clem. You know the marshal. How are ya, Clem? Hi, Marshal. Will you trust us 'til this afternoon? Miss Eleanor, I'll put you on the cuff for a month. Good. Say hello to your Aunt Sarah for me. I will. What is it this time? I've been keepin' track of Bonniwell like you told me. Yes? He just drove out of town, heading for the toll bridge road. Was he alone? No, Miss Sager was with him. You saw them leave together? Not 10 minutes ago. She talked about going to see her aunt, and the marshal left with her. How long will it take you to reach Hatton? About an hour. I don't know. Where's Miss Eleanor, Bones? Her and the marshal went down by the river. I'm so glad you asked me to come along. Peaceful after all the excitement in town. So nice just being here with you. John, there's something I must tell you about last night. About the satchel. I was lying to you when I said I saw inside of it. Lying to me? Jeff had a gun trained on you behind the counter. He did? He would have killed you if I hadn't stopped him. Eleanor, I knew you were lying to me about the satchel. But I didn't know that you were trying to save me, not him. So, this is where you're hiding. Jeff? I wouldn't wanna say anything, but I've known people to get themselves talked about for much less than this. I'm sorry you rode out here. You won't be when I tell you what brought me. You held up that bank messenger. I'm not worried about the past, John. It's the present that worries me. Gil Hatton's after you, and he knows where you are. Why are you warning me? Because I don't like the idea of Eleanor getting caught in the middle of a gunfight. Come on, we'll start back at once. You wouldn't mind if I went with you, would ya? Wouldn't it better for all concerned if you kept on going in the opposite direction? Well, what do you know about that? The man's jealous. Jeff, he's giving you a chance. He steals my girl, takes her off picnicking, and then expects me to miss the ride back to town. Personally, I think he's crazy. We're wasting time. Now, you're talking sense. Mr. Bonniwell, somebody's comin'. Right on schedule. Hold on. Come on, Eleanor, quick. You know, we haven't got much time. They'll be back and trace our wheel tracks. Broken Lance is just across the toll bridge. You and Eleanor had better get started on foot. What about you? I'll go in the opposite direction and lead them away from the bridge. But they'll catch you. Listen, lady, if you interfere with my fun, I'll sure spread tales about you and Bonniwell down there at the river. Come on, Bonniwell. Get in, Bones. But you don't know. Come on, Bones, get in. Yes, sir. What do you think, John? Where Jeff Barat is concerned, I'd stop thinking. Whoa, whoa, get outta there. Come on, get out. Pretty smooth. Got 'em all the way safely, didn't ya? Yeah. They'll probably refer to me in history books as the great liberator. What are we waitin' for? You forgot to liberate yourself, mister. Oh, I didn't think that was necessary. See, I'm Jeff Barat, Steve's brother. That's a good one. How do we know he's Steve Barat's brother? Take a look at that. "To Jeff, from Steve." Well, look what we got here. Come on, get out. Hello, Mr. Barat. Please, Mr. Barat, don't let him shoot me. That convince ya? Who's that boy? An old family retainer. I'll have to break you of the habit of riding in the back of surreys though. Oh, no, oh, yes. Well, we'll find out when we get in town. Get back in there. Let's go. Come on. Come on. John? I'm worried about Jeff. Aw, now don't you worry about him. He can take care of himself. Mr. Bonniwell, this just came for you. Thank you. And it is, therefore, the findings of this court that the defendants, William Daniels, Ed Tracy, Walter McIntyre, and Lloyd Frame, have violated the terms of their contracts under which they purchased land from the plaintive, Steven Barat, and said contracts are declared null and void. And the land will therefore revert to the plaintiff. Steve sold the town, and now he's taking it back. Order. Order. How did we know we were supposed to carry insurance? Barat never told us about it. Order, order. Any further disturbance, and I will order the courtroom cleared. Ignorance of the contents of the contract you signed is no excuse in the eyes of the law. Judgment is hereby entered against the defendants and in favor of he plaintiff, Steven Barat. Where's the marshal? Marshal? You will serve these notices on the defendants at once and take possession of the land in the name of. You're just a little hasty, Judge Larimore. Now, Marshal. I'll talk to you later, Mayor Hudkins. As Marshal of this town, I stand ready to perform all my duties, but the law specifically says that a judgment cannot be rendered in favor of anyone under indictment. You will have to prove that. I intend to. I have here an answer to a telegram that I sent to the police in New York City. It says to hold one Steven Baron, alias Steve Barat, who was indicted for grand larceny in New York state and fled before he could be arrested. Well, Marshal, it looks like you're one up on me. I guess mine is the next move. I guess so. Barat said to ride at once and take over the town. He's out of his mind. We ain't got enough men. We hired a crew of gunhands in Haleyville yesterday. He'll be waiting for you at the lower ford. Alright, saddle up, boys. You're riding with us, Barat. The marshal will probably make a stand at the jail, where he's got Steve Barat. Alright, we'll take the north road to town and nail him there. That's the trouble with you fellas. You don't plan things out. Just how would you go about doin' it? Well, in the first place, I'd use the element of surprise. I'd hit hard and quick before anyone in town knew what had happened. Go on. Well, the toll bridge is the direct way into town, not the north road. What are you getting at? I'm trying to tell you how to get into town fast with less chance of being seen. Maybe he's right. The north road's in plain sight for a mile. I was thinking about that. Let's get started. Once you're in town, you head straight for that jail and leave Bonniwell to me. Bones? Bones? Yes? Start running and don't stop until you get into town. Suppose I get caught? If you do, they'll shoot ya. That's what I thought. It's your business not to get caught. Go straight to the Marshal. Tell him they're coming into town by the toll bridge and to stop them with dynamite. Yes, sir. Did you say dynamite? Yes. Now, get to the brush. And, remember, dynamite. Dynamite. Hatton, there goes the boy. Get him. Barat, why didn't you grab him? Ever try to catch a scared rabbit? If he gets into town first. After what he heard, he'll probably head in just the opposite direction if I know that boy. You're likely right. Have a cigarette, Hatton. No, thanks. Come on along. Thanks a lot, Malachy. You and the boys have been a big help. I'd like to stay and get Hatton, but I've got to move Tom's outfit back to Texas. Yes, well, there are enough men in town. Marshal, just got out our first extra, all about the arrest of Steve Barat. We don't read a lot in this town. Mr. Bonniwell. Mr. Bonniwell. Mr. Marshal. Mr. Marshal. Take it easy, Bones. Take it easy. I run all the way. Mr. Jeff said. Well, where is he? What did he say? He said put dynamite under the bridge. Put dynamite under the bridge, Bones, why? Yeah, so the Hattons, they're on the way. Looks like we'd better not leave 'til tomorrow. Take him back to the hotel. Can you get your men together, Malachy? Yes, sir. John? John, what is it? What's happened to Bones? I guess we're in for a little trouble. I just got word from Jeff. The Hattons? I'm going to the bridge and try to stop them. Now, don't you take a notion to visit Aunt Sarah. John, you will be careful. I'm takin' Malachy and some men with me. Thanks to Jeff, we'll have a little surprise for 'em. Is there something I can do? Yes, you go to the hotel and stay there. What's up now? The Hattons are on their way. Let the marshal know as soon as you see 'em. I sure will. You know, Steve Barat ain't gonna like us blowin' up his bridge. Oh. Just got finished in time. I still hope we don't have to use it. Now, listen, boys. Let's see if we can't scare 'em off without any killings. And, Charlie, be sure and wait for my signal. Yes, sir. They're comin' now, Marshal. What's the matter, Hatton? There's not more than 10 men over there. That's enough to stop 50 of us tryin' to get across that bridge on horseback. Why don't you have your boys make it on foot? Not a bad idea. You and Barat take part of the men. We'll cover you. 10 of you men, come over here. The rest of you get behind these rocks on both sides. Come on, boys. Ready? Yeah, ready. Oh, no, you go first. They're comin' again, on foot this time. No, wait. Jeff said, we're to dynamite that bridge. Why was he on it? Some men aren't afraid to die, Malachy. Get your horses, men. Take the north road. Boys, we gotta beat 'em back to town. Billy, Frank. George, I want all the guns and ammunition you got in the hardware store. Alright, Marshal. Then, get every man in town that can pull a trigger. You keep your eye on the north road and let me know as soon as Hatton's come through. Boys, we gotta put a barricade across the road from the depot to the hotel. You give the orders, Marshal. We'll carry 'em out. Use anything, wagons, trunks, furniture. John, take anything you want from the hotel. Well, that's fine, but you keep off the street. I will. Come on, boys. Hurry, Miss Rogers. Hurry, hurry. Marshal, Marshal, I'm the mayor here. Aren't you overstepping your authority? Maybe I am. Why don't you take charge? Boys, take down those chairs. I'll go get Barat. John, John. Well, John, you'll be up and around in a day or two. I'm not so happy about that. I'm gonna miss our daily visits. I don't think you will. It's funny, you know, the only time we seem to have together is when I'm in a hospital. What's that noise? Oh, the townspeople are here to celebrate. You know, they can find more things to celebrate in this town. What is it now? Your engagement. Engagement? To whom? Why, to Miss Sager, of course. She announced it this morning. John, I didn't think you'd mind. Mind?
