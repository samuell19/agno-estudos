Does Laporte Eugene, a public utility entrepreneur, live here? - Yes Yes. - Wake him up. - Master? Yes, he left a long time ago. - Left? Where? - To my construction site in Chantilly. I'll have to bring stones to make drains. And not simple, but fortified! - Good. New construction in the East - is it interesting to you? What, could you agree? - Yes! - But it was led by the General Staff! And we went around it! So what do you say? This will end badly, master. After all, this is a competition for two. They talk about it at construction sites. There are even those who have vowed to skin you off. Let them try! It's not my fault that I work better. and cheaper than others! Okay, thanks, it'll do. Okay, goodbye guys! - Goodbye, master. - Police! - AND? Eugene Laporte, where is he? Master? At the office in Gennevilliers. He has an office there. Here, madam, this is a new dossier, I have no details. - Hello, Monsieur Laporte. - Hello. "Love is in the air..." - Hello, baby! - Hello. Now I’ll change and take care of the mail. Hello Madame Ferrier. Oh, went to the hairdresser? Oh! "Love is in the air..." Yes? Yes? - Ah, Eugene, are you here? - Yes. The chief accountant is with me, we need to see urgently. Well, show up. "Love is in the air..." Listen, Eugene... Where is he? Eugene? Eugene! - I'm holding it! - Eugene! Hello Monsieur Simone! As always, well dressed, cheerful, funny? - Monsieur Laporte! - Listen, now there is no time for jokes! Okay, okay, I'm listening to you, gentlemen. Cashier! 50 million! How? 50 million short? Everything is much worse: 50 million extra! It just proves that things are going well. Or that there are errors in your calculations. No, Monsieur Laporte, there are no mistakes in my accounting department! Eugene, I sense something unhealthy in this extra money. Okay, we'll figure it out tomorrow. Today... - What about today? - Today... "Love is in the air..." - Eugene... Eugene! - Labor inspector. - Let him come in! Oh sorry! What does she want here? Mademoiselle... oh, sorry. You know Monsieur Simone, my chief accountant, and Fernand Gaultier, my right hand? I have already had the pleasure of meeting these gentlemen. It was an expensive pleasure! 2 million fines for supposedly compulsory railings on the scaffolding! Mademoiselle is not joking with the rules! Fernand! A labor inspector is not paid for a joke, monsieur! Good. And how did we deserve your visit today, Mademoiselle? It was I who asked Mademoiselle Nason to come to us. You? Why do you? I warn you right away, Monsieur Laporte, if we are talking about challenging... Not at all! I asked you to come, so that we can visit the construction site together. And if you find the slightest mistake impose sanctions. - Rely on me. This is complete madness! But first, I would ask you to agree... uh... have lunch with me. - What? - Well... say yes. AND? - Good, yes. - Aha! As I see you are in a good mood! Then I'll add one more detail: will you marry me? - Oh no! I'm not suggesting you! Absolutely not. Well, Mademoiselle Nason? AND? From an invitation to dinner - to a marriage proposal... don't you feel like you are skipping stages? Uh... yes... but what do you want? I love you. Let's go, Monsieur Gaultier! Oh no, I can't leave him like this. I can not! - No, no, don't wear glasses! - Eugene! AND? Oh sorry. You are hiding behind your glasses. Without them, you are tenderness itself, condescension and kindness. Will you allow? It's easy to be indulgent when you can't see anything. However, one detail eludes me! Why did you take off your pants to tell me all this? Oh, just... really! Since we talk so freely, I want to confess to you I find your proposal rude, but... touching. It is very much in your character, which I began to recognize. Sincere, direct... - Brave! Yes. And most importantly - and in my eyes it is most valuable - honest! Deeply honest. Police! Laporte Eugene? - It's me. We have a warrant for your arrest from Judge Bajolras. Follow us. - I AM? But what have I done? You are accused of giving away state defense secrets foreign power. - What? I AM?! Do you recognize this document? Yes it... This is a plan for a military airfield at Karbak. But I'd say it's a photocopy made on the device in my office! You said it yourself! Wow! But the original is in my safe and only I have the key. Here, look! And my key? Let me leave it to myself. But I need him, how funny you are! Moreover, we have found in your accounting department the amount of 500 thousand francs - 50 million old - which seem to have come in time to close the end of the month. Oh, well, well, it looks like you here are aware of all my business! Anonymous written denunciation! A nasty gesture, but very useful. Ah, I get it! Your anonymous letter! It's signed! This is competition! What a bastard! Threw 50 lemons to kill me! And I was warned! - OK OK! Who is foolish enough to spend 50 million with one goal - to get rid of a competitor? I'll explain it to you next time, Mr. Judge. Now I have no time I have, shall we say, an engagement lunch. Mnyam-mnyam, right? I'm late, by the way. - Monsieur Laporte! Defendant Laporte! It's time for you to realize your position! In wartime, this would be a death sentence. - Damn it! - Come on, let's not go crazy! The time is peaceful now. You will get off with only 15-20 years in prison. - Only? Wow! - I forgot to say, this penalty implies the application of Article 37, those. complete confiscation of all current and future property. - What?! - In any case, the money is in prison... No, do you hear ?! I created my business myself, with my own hands! Your sweat! - Calm down, Laporte! Confiscate my case ?! Where are my companions? For unemployment benefits? You won't feed them, will you? God! Here's what I'll do with your accusations! Security! What are you waiting for?! This is a traitor! Traitor? I AM?! There were no traitors in our family! Laporte Eugene, Senior Corporal of the 3rd Engineering Regiment ?! I'm French, monsieur! Present! Long live France! Long live France! Monsieur Gaultier is waiting for me. Wait? We, mademoiselle, have been doing this for 2 months already. Oh, are you still here? - Yes. - Well, there is news? - Eugene has finally been transferred from solitary confinement. I was allowed to talk to him. Fine. When will you see him? At 3 o'clock. I called you in the hope that you have a message for him. You can tell him that I believe him. And that I will wait for him. As long as it takes. Tell me, Monsieur Gaultier, is it true what they say? That Mr. Laporte will remain in prison, will the enterprise be closed? I will keep you posted. Goodbye. Antoine, do you, too, seem convinced of Mr. Laporte's innocence? Yes. So do I. Dear Master. I know that Article 37 is a complete confiscation. - Complete! - Good. But under Article 38 It is enough for Eugene to get married to save half of the property. And we have a candidate. - AND! Did she say yes? - Yes, and she is waiting for you. Yes... Can you get married in prison? The trial will take place in a week, the publication of the wedding announcement will take 3 weeks. This is true. Then there remains another solution - all under the same Article 38 - adoption. - Yes! Yes! If there are three children, only 1/4 is confiscated, that is, 3/4 will be saved. It's funny! Do you have a Criminal Code too? Yes. I've read it before you, and I know better! Adoption... this is a long formality and the consent of the judge! - But excuse me, master... - Shut up, Fernand! Don't teach the master the laws! If he says “nothing can be done,” then nothing can be done. All you can hope for is for the shortest possible time: 5 years. They will pass quickly. With your profession, you can rest. The prison promotes relaxation. Yes, in other words - I was lucky! Ah, these lawyers! If I were guilty, he could prove that I was innocent. But since I'm really innocent, he can't do anything. Okay, I took precautions! The perfect fugitive set! Wow! Well, you are impudent! Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything? - No I do not think so. Has Maitre Sowason already gone? Just got out. And when? I'll wait for you outside with a car and a few hours later - oops! - we will leave France. No, monsieur! I will not flee from the justice of my country! If I run away, it’s only to recognize my 3 illegitimate children in the city hall. How! You have 3 illegitimate children and you never told me? I'll explain it later. Children born out of wedlock enjoy the same rights as as legitimate children, eh? It's true, I read it in the code. Then it turns out with 3 children under article 38, the state will take away only 25%! - Voila! - So... Very clever! My file! How can I run away now without a file? You cretin! No, you idiot in a cube! Now you don't have to run! Children born out of wedlock can be recognized in prison too! - How? - Sure. It is enough to call a notary. So, write down the names and dates of birth of the children for me. - I can't! - How can you? You forgot! Try to remember, Eugene! There is nothing to remember here! I don't have these children! Not yet! It is you, little Fernand, who will find them for me wherever you want. I need 3 children of fatherlessness. 2 boys and 1 girl. A girl, preferably with blue eyes. With blue eyes! Desirable! - Excuse me, monsieur! - What's the matter? I am about the recognition of illegitimate children. Child's date of birth and your last name? My surname? Yes. Since you want to recognize a child born out of wedlock, I suppose you want to give him your last name? The thing is, I have nothing to do with it, you know? Sorry? If you prefer, I'm out of business. Your alcove secrets don't interest me, monsieur! No, I... I came instead of my friend. Yes? Do you want to recognize your friend's child? No... he wants me... to come and admit him. Whom? Your friend? No... his children. Listen, monsieur, try to be clearer. Whose child is this? - Not... not him. - So yours. And not mine. Listen, if there is no way to know which of you two is the father, give the mother's last name. Who the mother is is always known. But no. Are you kidding me ?! Oh no, no, I wouldn't dare! Now you will understand everything. It's about a friend who can't move. How is it? Impotent? Yes and no. He is not free in his movements. That is, among other things, your impotent is also absent-minded, doesn’t remember his mother’s name? So? Something like this. The main thing for him is to recognize three children. - Three children ?! - Yes, three small children. Wow impotent! But we still return to the same point: How can I find these children without a name and date of birth, huh? It doesn't matter. Give me three at random. At random?! Yes, preferably 2 boys and 1 girl. If you will, I will look at your accounting books. That's not for long. I forbid you, monsieur, I forbid you! No one has access to the registry office data! Come out, monsieur! Get out before I call the police! - Good. If you perceive so... - Come out, monsieur! I thought I was doing you a favor... At random! Municipality 5th District Municipality of the 11th District Municipality of the 4th District One girl with blue eyes... Hey master! - Yes? Repeat! - You think? - Yes, another sip. Last, last... Actually, no, no. I lack courage. I give up. - Eh, no! For once, the man wanted to take responsibility! Madame, I went around all the registry offices in Paris. And every time: "Halle-op! Go away!" Sorry, monsieur. I'm from the registry office opposite, and for us it is a matter of 2 minutes! Mademoiselle Shoshuan churns them out like on an assembly line! Mademoiselle Shoshuan? Mademoiselle Chauschuan, we need you. We brought you a client. Good fellow who does not dare to recognize his child! Well, isn't that a poor fellow? - We will convince him. Come, monsieur, I'll scold you. - Oh no, no... Come on, make the right gesture. And then - I treat everyone. I'm listening to you, young man. Well... it's not easy to say... because... Aha! I can listen to you. Trust me! Ok... How to recognize children if you don't know their date of birth, their surname, or their mother? - I solved problems and more difficult. - True? Partly, I confess, thanks to my feminine intuition. You are a toy in the hands of a bad woman, admit it! I present your drama. The mistake of youth child... - as always in such cases - unfortunate victim. And for you since then - remorse, remorse... obsessively! Poor young man! How old is the child? Well-ooh... By eye, I would give him... 8, no 10 years! 10 years, yes! I guessed! I knew it! Children of love are almost always conceived in the spring! - Yes, yes, yes... - It turns out January-February 1956. Nothing is impossible! We'll find something now. Married... Married... Married. Married! Married! Extramarital! Well, well, well... Georges Noel, father and mother are unknown. It's not him? Wait... Hello? Yes, Mr. Assistant Mayor! Yes, Mr. Assistant Mayor! Oh, you won't get bored with this new assistant! Wait for me here, I'm with him for a long time. And don't try to escape! - No no no. Hello monsieur. I came to formalize the birth. Can't you see I'm busy ?! Sorry, I'll come by later. Yes, then, then, my friend. Goodbye, monsieur. Married... married ... married... Wow! In a sconce... illegitimate! Two already. Laporte, this is Master Vertex, a notary from Paris. - Monsieur! - Thank you, master, for your concern. The head guard and I will be witnesses during the procedure. Well? As ordered: 2 boys and 1 girl. Monsieur, I have all the information about you, let's move on, please, to information about children. Well, I... So, monsieur? Sorry, this is... Sorry, these are emotions. - It's so natural! Well, I have... the first is... Georges Noel. The second is... Zoë... Dusheman. And the third... Roger Martan. - "It is written down correctly from my words." And the signature. - Sign. Ferrera, your deed will be credited to you. As for you, Mademoiselle, let me congratulate you. Your intuition, your beneficial influence on Ferrera, avoided miscarriage of justice and prove the innocence of Mr. Laporte. Thank you, mademoiselle. Mr. Judge, when will he be released? - Immediately! - Well. - Goodbye, monsieur! - Goodbye, master. And thanks for everything. Goodbye, master. Well? Happy dad? Happy uncle! You're doing fine! Come on, I'll kiss you. He's the one, Mr. Attorney General. Laporte Eugene? Immediately! My compliments, Mr. Attorney General! It's funny! These three children - even if it is a lie, but I feel special... Yeah... Laporte! Mr. Laporte! I just got a call from the Prosecutor's Office! Your innocence has been proven. You go free! Damn it! Like this? Free! Free! What's that facial expression? Yes, I thought about children! It was all in vain. Not at all! I have long dreamed of a big family. No, no, I don't regret anything. We'll take care of them! How will your fiancée react to this? Ah... yes, really... There is Elizabeth, yes... I have always believed in the innocence of Mr. Laporte! This is a man without secrets, unable to hide anything! No, no, no one drinks until the owner arrives! Isn't that so, Mademoiselle? - Yes of course. How good it is outside! Oh-la-la... Yeah, although they feed and shelter here, I would not spend my vacation here! Take your time, you may soon find yourself behind these walls again. Like this? Well, of course! You were innocent, and now you are free. But now, with your false recognition of paternity, you are guilty up to the throat! Is it a crime to give your name to three poor abandoned children? Yes! You have committed a fraud against society, article 147, punishment - up to 20 years in prison, plus an attempt to harm the treasury - 5 years, plus false statement, false paternity, article 154 - 2 years! Wow! Poor Eugene - 27 years old! And you, as his accomplice, will receive 15 years! Couldn't you hold your tongue? Why did you tell him everything? - But he's my lawyer! - No more, monsieur! I don’t take on losing business! Goodbye monsieur! It's all your fault - you came up with the idea of ​​recognizing 3 children! - Well, you and the impudent! - Yes Yes! Who brought a notary to prison? - I. - That's it, you! Always you! Goonies! Taxi! Hurry! Can't you see I'm taking my change? Yes, faster! Mademoiselle, they've arrived! Do you know Eugene Laporte? Uh... depends on why you need it. I have an urgent call for him to judge Gobert. Already?! Give it to me. I'll tell you when I see him. Eugene! Eugene! Come on, Laporte Eugene! - I will go. - Are you Laporte Eugene? Not really, I'm in his place. What's gotten into you? You will get 15 years! No, no, 27. I'll take care of everything. You are crazy? - I am the only one to blame! - Never! Get out of here! No, no, Eugene! You are the groom and the father of the family! I sacrifice myself. Not worth it! Take me! Take them both! I don `t understand... Go-go! - Mr. Judge! - Yes? Laporte delivered. Thank. This is the father. - AND! How long did he recognize his son! - Have a seat. - Thank. Enter. It's me, Mr. Judge! I am the only one to blame! No, it's me, Mr. Judge! I am the only one responsible for everything! No, no! I alone answer! This is not true, Mr. Judge! I take care of everything! Which of you two is Eugene Laporte? Is he! But I am to blame, Mr. Judge. No, no, I assure you, I did it myself. Gentlemen, you will argue about the paternity of the child elsewhere. A child? Which child? The one you recognized by law. Georges Noel! Baby! Baby baby... AND! - Who is this gentleman? - Family friend. - Close, as I see? - Yes, close. Yes, very close. Well, if Inspector Barnashon is to be believed, there won't be many dads. Are you talking about human flesh? This is it. And this too! Inspector Barnashon looked after the child for a couple of hours. This is a madman, a fugitive and a fighter. Closing it for 2-3 years will only benefit! My son - to a correctional prison ?! Never, gentlemen! - No never! From now on, Mr. Laporte, you are endowed with paternal authority. Will you leave the child to social services or will you take care of him yourself? No, I'll take my son with me! - Yes, we'll take it, we'll take it. - Well, that's what you need! Mr. Laporte, I am pleased with your reaction. Bring us the baby. Have a seat, gentlemen. Fernand, have you heard? Our baby is here. - Yes. I have no candy. You never think about anything! Here is the product. - Listen. - Yes? Do you know that he looks like you? Do not exaggerate. Yes, yes, there is something in it. Yes? True? They say I have a dad now? Which one of you? I bet this one, tall blond. From now on, my child, you come under the protection and authority of your father. Whether this one or another - everything is better than this Barnashon skin! Isn't that right, spik? - Well. Georges, come here. Do mercy, apologize immediately before Mr. Barnachon. Apologize? This is to teach you how to be polite to everyone. And this, my little man, to let you know that now you have a dad. And uncle. Uncle Fernand. - Yeah. Here they are! Thank you very nice. What does it mean? This is Macedonian: welcome, master, and always be with us! My construction sites are all over Europe. And you, baby, what did you do while I was in jail? Madame Ferrier and I prayed 300 times a day to be released. - You won't leave us again? - Let's hope! - Eh... well, yes... - Toast to Mr. Laporte! Ladies and Gentlemen! “Elizabeth, I have to make a confession. - Then, Eugene, then! Have a drink with your friends. - To the health of our master! For you! For your health! And thanks!

I thought this kid called you dad? - Yes? Did he call me dad? - You could have warned me! - Eh... are you offended? - Offended? I realized that we know each other very little. And before marrying you... - Let me explain everything. It takes me a few days to figure out myself. Okay... Elizabeth! - Eugene, hush! - Elizabeth! Eugene! Listen to me, Eugene! If you tell her, we'll both end up in jail! You are 27 years old, and I am 15. - Leave me alone! It is your fault that she got sick! - Is it my fault that she left? - Oh-la-la... Catch her! I want her to know that I am not the father of this child! And he? What are you going to tell him, huh? That he is not your son anymore? Yes? Yes true... "And now Zoë, the idol of youth, will sing" Foolish "for you. Friends call me Silly This is all because of my face. But I don't care, I don't care I have a great life with my face. Friends call me Silly... The emphasis is not on high notes, but on low notes! Otherwise distort my daughter's voice! Mom, I will ask you to leave me alone! How dare you speak to me in such a tone! Shut up, madam. I'm transmitting! And I keep laughing. I'm not that crazy. Daddies call me Silly. And I am deliberately playing dumb. If not, then my fans It gets too much, and it scares me, oh-oh-oh! But there is one person who sees the silly thing The way she is, with her real face. This is my dear. I love his blue eyes They can be seen when he brushes the hair from his forehead. And I keep laughing. I'm not that crazy. Well that's it, freaks! Krants are your part, my dear. Are you an impresario or not? - There will be no tours in Germany. - What? “They didn't give Zoë's passport. - Why? After all, you need a birth certificate to get a passport? - So what? - And then! At the city hall, I learned that your daughter has just been recognized. - Did you? Who! - Don't you know? I have always had a bad memory for surnames. - Eugene Laporte. Doesn't it tell you anything? - Eugene Laporte? There is nothing. But this does not mean that the father is not him! Hey you! Are you laughing in my face? Okay. I want to say that my many partners... on stage, I emphasize! - on stage - performed under pseudonyms, and I had no idea of ​​the real names of my des Grieux and Donov Jose. I wish I knew who this handsome man is what does he do and what is famous for... - Eugene Laporte! - Eugene... No, I don't know any Eugene. But I'll figure it out. Where does he live? Hello! Elizabeth! You don't answer, but I know that you are on the phone. Listen, Elizabeth! The kid is sick! 36.7 °. But that doesn't mean anything! Do you think this is serious? I called the doctor, but he will only come in the evening. What crazy people! Of course, this is not their child! If only Elizabeth were here! She would know... Well? How do you feel, my bunny? - I tell you, good! Just ate chocolate eclairs. And now I vomit, and I'm much better. No need to talk, the temperature will rise! Yes you are right. "HOW TO CARE FOR A CHILD AND HOW TO RAISE HIM" We came up with the same idea. Appendicitis... Chain... tapeworm... Dropsy of the testicle... oh! Infected pseudocyst of pancreatitis! Fernand, something must be done immediately! For example, a hot water bottle! Oh no no... Enema! - Yes, great idea! A small enema won't get any worse. He's sleeping. - We'll do it anyway. No, no, it might wake him up. Let him sleep for now. Enema! Aha, enema! So I was given! Listen, the Christmas tree in February is original! Look, he's going back too! He will be pleased! What do you think of my astronaut helmet? Oh great! Look, I can send personal messages, look! Don't move, look. Funny, huh? - Suits you. Will you give to vilify? - Yes, but later, not immediately. And you haven't seen everything yet! Look here! Wow! Does this work too? Of course it works! - He will have everything... - What we didn't have! Yes Yes... Hi baby! Do you practice mountaineering? - None of your business! “I thought you were sick. They are sick! Complete psychos! If they wanted to play me like a doll, they miscalculated. I'm leaving. What is this motor? I forced it a little. What about the carburetor? With a switch. - Can I see? - Yes! So. Are you sure it's not dangerous? - No, I put only half the charge. - Well, then come on. - She's like real! - Yes? - Yes! We turn on the ignition... - Yes.

Maybe we should shoot the rocket? - No, don't touch! Break it down! - I am starting to worry! - Oh, coward! It is immediately obvious that you were in civil defense. - Yes, in the civilian. - How is this done? No, let's get out of here! Eugene, you can't stay here, we are at great risk! Prosperous! Very well off! What is it?! What is it?! What it is?! - Mum! Mum! - What is it ?! What happened? - Eugene! - Where are you? - Are you here, Eugene? - Wow! - Nothing with you? - Nothing.

La-fa, do-re-mi-fa-sol! Well, the voice is not the same. And then I worked in a team with my friend, who sang... Negro spiritual chants. It's true. - Mr. Laporte, the police are here! - AND? Inspector Barnachon brought baby Georges' things. Policeman! Just in time! I'll prove to you what happened between us! But not in front of the baby! - Oh, mom! Let go! Let me go! Inspector Barnashon! What's going on here? Never mind. We play classics. One, two, three, house! - Oh, inspector! I'll tell you what's going on! - Not! I will not say that you are Zoë's father, even to save your life! But I am ready to make your daughter happy, as if I were her real father! Zoë sells 500,000 records a year! Okay, I... I will do whatever you want. - Yes? - Well... Within a reasonable. How is it? well then I don't understand why I would agree to play this humiliating comedy! Mum! Mommy! Things are good? - Yes, honey, everything is fine. - Inspector Barnashon!

Oh-la-la... One mother was enough for me! Well! Let's kiss if you are my dad. Oh, my daughter! You will see, Zoë, you will not regret it! And me, her mommy, too! Well, what are we waiting for, why don't we kiss mom? Elizabeth, wait! I'll explain everything to you! Elizabeth! - Elizabeth! Elizabeth, listen! Stop! Stop! - Elizabeth! - Goodbye, dad! No, I'm not a dad! Come on, catch her! Stop! My car! Not! You will not pass! Oh my car! Barnashon's car fell to pieces! Are you crazy, Eugene? Nothing with you? There is nothing. - You thought to leave, ha ha ha... - It will cost you dearly! You do not know me well! One child is still all right. But two is a bit too much! And even the mother in addition - no, this is too much! She just said goodbye to me. She is leaving. More precisely, she left - she is already far away! On the other side of the world! I beg you, Elizabeth, agree to dine with me tonight! You are torturing me! What do you say? At the White Truffle? You are lucky to be a gourmet. Okay, so you got it? Yes, I'm coming! Oh-la-la...
