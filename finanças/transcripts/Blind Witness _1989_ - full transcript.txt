- [Maggie] On belay. - [Gordon] Right, one more pitch now. Nice and slow. Pace yourself, then you can lay up easy. Good hold out to the right. Maggie, there's a good finger jam just around that overhang. Hang on, I'm gonna tie off. Gimme some slack, honey. I kicked the gear. I'm traversing up this plate, Mag. Hey, it's easier if you angle over to your right. - [Maggie] I wanna come up the way you did. - Pretty thin that way. - [Maggie] Give me slack. - Be strong. Be fluid. I should have my brains examined for bringing you up here. - [Maggie] I've been training for this. You said I could do it. - [Gordon] All right, easy, easy, easy. - [Maggie] Tension, tension. - Maggie! Maggie! Stay right there, I'll be down. Don't move, don't move, I'm coming down. - [Maggie] No, I'm coming up. Give me slack. - Look, we're gonna collect the hardware. We'll take the elevator down. - [Maggie] Are you kidding? We're almost at the top. - Come on, let's go. All right, great, easy. All right, there you go. Slowly, slowly now. That's it. (laughing) - I did it. Tell me what you see. - It's so clear, you can see for miles. The mountains fall really quickly into the valley. Great white granite cliffs. And the fall's just coming on, so there's a lot green shades with some russets and golds. And that sky. I can't tell you really what the color of the sky is. - I know. - It's you. - [Maggie] Better watch your backside, Gordo. One of these days, I'm gonna be on lead. - [Gordon] Guess so. - Course I have a natural advantage over you. I never look down. - Don't you get so cocky, girl. There's still a number of areas where I can whip your adorable butt. - Oh, you think so? - Yeah. - Yeah? Flowers, mm. Okay, name one. - Well, I can name a bunch. Darts, Donkey Kong, paint by number, catch the bell pepper. (laughing) - [Woman] Hi there, Mrs. Kemlich. - [Maggie] Hi. How 'bout if I make a seafood salad? - Okay. - I bet our favorite contractors left the house a mess. - Well, he's gonna put on some extra day labor, so everything will be wrapped up by noon. - These tomatoes are going downhill fast. - Yeah, they certainly are, but never judge a piece of fruit by its skin. The sweetest part's always in the middle. - [Maggie] What is this? - You know, it's just a little advance on your birthday goodies. - Well, as long as we're on that topic, I want to talk about my birthday rules, okay? - Tomorrow is your day so I will be your 24-hour love slave. - All right, love slave, well here are the rules. I pick the restaurant, I make the reservations, and it's a secret till we get there. - Come on, what is this, a birthday dinner or a covert operation? - I don't want it to turn into some kinda birthday deal with a bunch of waiters and a cupcake and a sparkler and everybody singing Happy Birthday, okay? - Yeah. - Gordon, I mean it. You make this into a deal, you're gonna have the sex life of a weathervane rooster. - [Gordon] Don't make idle threats. - [Maggie] What makes you think it's idle? - [Gordon] Wonder how they're doing? Oh no, here we go again. - What's wrong, contractor? - He promised. He swore he'd be wrapped up and out of here. - [Worker] Got that tar paper here. - That's all right. What are you gonna do? I'll make a salad. - Just level with me, will you Frank? First, your promised me by Labor Day, then you give me your word of honor that you're gonna be out of here by the end of September. Frank, look, do you really think that a round peg is gonna fit into a square hole? - Well, no problem, we'll just chip out the hole, and shape it up, and then we fill it in with concrete. - Yeah, but you can't start laying carpet until the concrete dries. You got all the painting left to do. You got tools left all over the place. What are you gonna do? - Don't drip it on the glass. I told you to mask it off. Now, if you can't understand plain English... - Add Dijon mustard to the shopping list, an I'm almost out of freezer wrap. (rumbling) (Maggie shouting) - Are you all right? - Yeah. - Frank, how many times I gotta tell you? You could've really done some damage. - You're right. - This could've cut her wrist. - Absolutely right. - Forget that. Who used my jewelry dish as an ash tray? - He said he'd be out of here by tonight. - Left over. I've got a little problem with that safe. I can come out here with a concrete cutting saw first thing in the morning. - Oh, great, happy birthday to me. - Mag. Babe, I'm really sorry about all that stuff inside. You've been a real support through all this mess. - I'm really proud of you, Gordon. - Proud of me, why? - Gordon, private consluting has been your dream. Now you're really doing it. That takes a lot of courage. - Well, you know darlin', this thing might not ever pay off. It's really hard for me to rely on you. - Oh, Gordon, I rely on you for almost everything. Anyway, I make enough money. - Yeah, you do, don't you? - Good, because we're gonna be counting on you to keep coming up with the talent to fill all these new slots we got. - Morning, Maggie. - Hi, Jesse. - Morning, Don. - Hi, Jesse, how you doin'? - Well, that's no problem. - By the way, isn't Barbara with us today? I thought I saw her earlier. - [Maggie] Oh, she got called by the daycare center. Her daughter had an allergic reaction to her new formula. She'll be right back. If you're worried about her missing the meeting, though, I'll copy her and make sure she's up to speed. - Listen, Maggie, don't take this as criticism, okay? You've done a sensational job in personnel since taking over that department. But can you imagine what would happen if everybody brought their kid, their poodle-- - Well, it'd be a new twist on affirmative action. - [Don] Really? - Look, we've added a daycare center and some wheelchair ramps. A lot of companies spend double that on redecorating the corporate jet. - But Maggie, I was just looking at a purchase order the other day. Six playpens and nine bottle warmers in telemarketing? - Take a look at the numbers. Sales are up 40% and absenteeism is cut in half. - Hey, Maggie, I'm winking. - Okay. Hi. - Hey, how's the birthday girl? - Shh, not public information. - [Tim] Flash. - You can tell the light? - When it's real strong I can. - [Joanna] Yeah, well, it's strong. After one of these things, I see polka dots for days. - Hey, Mag. - Tim. How was your hot date last night? - [Joanna] Hot? Well, I think the hottest thing about it was probably the Cajun shrimp. - [Maggie] Uh oh. - I don't know, sometimes I look at you and Gordon. I mean, how'd you guys luck into each other? - Blind date. - Oh (laughing). (laughing) (ominous music) - Maggie. Last time, the lamb was kind of disappointing, but I thought tonight it was terrific. - I thought everything was good. You know what would finish tonight off perfectly? - [Gordon] Well, it's your day, babe. - How 'bout if we light a fire, we throw some pillows down on the floor, and heat this place up like a sauna. And I can go up and get the almond oil I've been saving and-- - I don't think we're gonna get anything past this lady. - [Crowd] Surprise! (horns blowing) - Hey, birthday girl. - [Joanna] I mean, I don't get it. What tipped us? - It was too easy. When I went to turn on the light switch for Gordon, it was already on. And I knew it was off when we left. And then when we walked in, I could smell Todd all the way across the room. You're varnishing your canoe again. But you're the one who tipped it. - No. - Yup, this morning when you mentioned my birthday dinner. I never said anything about a birthday dinner. - What, Miss Spartypants? Here's one that you didn't get. - Maggie. - Now, with this, you can ski Everest in the privacy of your den. - Oh, Gordon, thank you. Thank you. - Happy birthday, dear. - Thank you. - Good night, guys. - Good night. - Take care. - Good night. - Great party, thanks for coming. - Good night. - Good night. - Good night, thanks. - Drive slowly. - [Maggie] Thank you for coming. See you Monday. - See you later. Good night. See ya. Good night. Still want the almond oil and the fire? - Gordon, you never needed any props. (ominous music) (rattling) (digital beeping) (dog barking) (wooden thudding) Gordon? Gordon? (tearing) (shouting) - [Burglar] Get her arms. Shut up. - Hello. - [Recording] At the tone, the time will be 1:55. - Maggie? (shouting) You, why don't you just get out of here while you can? - Yeah, why don't you come on down here right now? Come on. That's right. I'd put that down. I swear to God I would. (electrical buzzing) (shouting) - Don't hurt her. Just tell me what you're looking for. - The safe. - Don't hurt her. - Yeah, I know there's a safe. Yeah, come on, you show it to me. - The workers screwed up. They never put it in. - What, this is it? - Yeah. - This goes over here? Okay, bag the safe. Where's the money, huh? (shouting) (electrical buzzing) (shouting) You won't do that again, huh? Come on, let's come over here. Come on, let's see. If there's nothing valuable, how come you need the safe, huh? Shut up. - [Burglar] Somebody's gonna hear. - Shut up. - It's my work. Full of books. - Well, if they're rare they gotta be worth money. - No. - Oh, aren't they worth money? (electrical buzzing) (shouting) - [Burglar] Hey, look at his head. He's bleedin'. He ain't movin'. This is bad. - Shut up. - This is really bad. Come on, let's get out of here. What are you doin'? If she's blind, she'll never make us. Come on, come on. Come on, come on. (pounding) One dead guy's bad enough, come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here, come on! - Here, take this. - What are you doin'? (glass shattering) My chain. - Move it. (shouting) (screaming) - So what have we got here? The dispatcher said homicide burglary. - Medical examiner share any wisdom with us before he took the body off? - They worked him over with a stun gun. The actual death came from some kinda head trauma. - Fingerprints? - Clean. - Yeah. - Surgical gloves. Real familiar. - Yeah, isn't it? Only they made a mistake this time. They left an eyewitness behind. - They brief you? Mrs. Kemlich's been blind since childhood. - That's great. - [Officer] Sarge, we need you over here for a second. - I know how painful it must be for you to have to keep going over this. - I want to remember. I want to do everything I can to help catch those two men. - Good. You say two men, huh? Don't taken his wrong, but given your circumstance, how can you be certain their weren't others in the house as well? - Hello, I believe the Lieutenant hasn't introduced us. - It's Tuthill, ma'am. Mike Tuthill. - [Maggie] Tuthill. - That's very good. - It's not a parlor trick. - No, of course not. I'm sorry. Did they use names? Did they say anything to each other that might help us to identify them? - No. - We've been investigating a series of burglaries over the past year. I don't know if you've been following the news. You may have seen... It was a couple murdered last month in the Federal Heights area during a burglary, the circumstances of which were very similar to what happened here last night. - You think this is a serial thing? - I'm not in a position to say that yet. I'm just saying there were similar circumstances. I see that you were installing a safe. Were you and Mr. Kemlich in the habit of keeping large sums of money in the house? - No, no, there wasn't any money. They killed him for nothing. - We saw the broken window, is that how they got in? - I remember breaking glass. Breaking glass. - After the attack, after they tied you up, they took him into the den. - It wasn't a den. It was going to be Gordon's office. - Do you recall anything else, like textures or odors? - There was a sound. They had this crackling electrical sound. - Yes, we're fairly certain that they used a stun gun to coerce your husband. - Coerce? They tortured him. - Yes, I'm sorry to put you through this ordeal, Mrs. Kemlich. Thank you. - There was something. Wait, there was a terrible smell on them. They smelled awful, like death. - We got a couple of homicidal maniacs on the loose. I want you to use your energy getting the scientific evidence the DA's gonna need to lock this case. - What you're saying is because she's blind, you're ruling her out as a credible witness? - Listen, Tut, I know there have been a few changes in the department while you were on furlough. - Oh, don't call it that. - But even you have gotta be aware that we're looking for two male suspects in the Federal Heights murders. - I know that. But before you jump to some obvious conclusions-- - I'm not jumping to anything. We've got the same MO there. They used a stun gun. - Yeah, but they didn't use these. - [Lieutenant] What? What's your point? - In the newspaper accounts of Federal Heights, they said the victims were bound with zip cord. This kind. - Yeah. - But in fact, they were tied with zip ties, those things electricians use. They got it backwards. - So maybe they didn't make it to the hardware store. - What I'm saying is somebody lifted it right out of the paper, and they tried to make it look like the Federal Heights case. - Listen, we've got two solid suspects in this case. Let's not invent new ones. - Where? - Here. - Maggie, I packed you an overnight bag. And anything I forgot, you can borrow. - Oh, Joanna, thank you. But I think I'm gonna stay here tonight. The officer said he's have a car go by every hour. - [Joanna] Maggie, I don't think this is a time for you to prove your independence. - Oh, I'm not. It's just that Gordon's family's flying in tomorrow. And friends are going to be coming and people from the university. I just feel like I need a little privacy right now. It's kind of my last chance to be alone. - If you need anything... - [Maggie] Thanks. - I'm just a few minutes away. (engine humming) (dog barking) - Who's there? (thudding) Who's there? I know somebody's there. (metallic clattering) (metallic clattering) - [Operator] Emergency operator. - Help me! Help me! - Best we can tell, there's no indication of any forced entry. - It's okay now, Mrs. Kemlich. I don't know if you remember me. - Detective Tuthill? - That's right. Now, to the best of your ability, can you tell me what happened here? - One of the men who killed my husband came back. (beeping) - Call that in for me, will you? Find out what thy want. How do you know it was one of them? Did he say what he wanted? - [Maggie] No. - He threatened you? - With this. - Bag that and send it on to the lab for fingerprint analysis. - My God, are you all right? - Yeah, what? - I think Mrs. Kemlich can breathe a little easier now. That was the lieutenant. A couple of hours ago, they arrested the two guys that murdered her husband and the other couple. - Two hours ago? - That's right, over in Layton Hills. - Well, that's not possible. Layton Hills is on the other side of town. One of the men who killed Gordon was here less than an hour ago. - They don't book people these days unless somebody's pretty certain. - I'm telling you that I'm certain one of the men who killed my husband was here tonight in my house. - Let me have your hand a minute. This is a CD player. The serial numbers on it are the same as those of one that was taken from the Federal Heights house. We found it, along with some other items, in the suspect's car. Here, let me have your hand a minute. This is a stun gun. (gasping) No, it's turned off. They tried to use it on one of our officers. Big mistake. - Did you find anything that directly links them to Gordon's murder? - Well, no, not yet we haven't. We will. - What do I have to do to convince you? One of the men who killed my husband was back in our house. - Did the lab find any fingerprints on that wire whip? - Just Mrs. Kemlich's. - Too bad. - Are the men in the building? - [Lieutenant] I think they're still downstairs being processed, aren't they? - Yes, sir. - Yeah. - You could hold a lineup. - Pardon? - You could hold a lineup. - Let's say she can ID these guys. It only adds more weight to the case. - Come on, the woman's blind. - I know, but there's precedent. I hear about a blind rape victim who identified her attacker from a lineup. And in fact, there was another case like that. - Look, we've got the car. We have evidence that places them at the Federal Heights scene. - Yeah, but what if she can place them at her house? We're close to an airtight case here. There's nothin' to lose. - I really don't see how we're supposed to go about this. - [Maggie] Just have them say the words. - Number one, I want you to say show me the safe. - [Suspect] Show me the safe. - Number one, repeat after me-- - I need to hear them. I need to hear them up close. - Tuthill, stay with her. - [Maggie] Say get her hands. - [Suspect] Get her hands. - [Maggie] Breathe deeply for me. - [Suspect] Why? - Do what she says. (breathing deeply) - Two and six. - Mrs. Kemlich, I owe you an apology. I really didn't think this was gonna work. I'm very impressed, you just nailed the lid on this case. - I'm sorry, I don't think so. They're not the men who killed Gordon. - You just picked them out of the lineup. - That's right, I picked out your suspects. It wasn't very difficult. They still smell like fingerprint ink. - Somebody want to tell me the purpose of this exercise? - Yes, the purpose hopefully is to convince you that the men who killed my husband aren't here. - [Gordon] Yeah, honey, I know about the Dijon and the freezer wrap. Also, I don't want you to forget we have plans for tomorrow. - Mrs. Kemlich? - Detective Tuthill. - Hello. - Hello. - You two sure put a lot of nice touches into this place. - That's why I can't go on living here. - The county attorney's brought indictments against our two suspects. He thinks he has what he needs to go to trial. - But the case doesn't include Gordon's murder? - It's still an open investigation. - Oh, well, by those standards, who killed Cock Robin is still an open investigation. - I think I know what you're going through. - You think you know? Oh, you know what it's like to have thugs violate your home. You know what it's like to be right there, helpless, while somebody's torturing the person you just made love to. You think you know? - Look, is there some way I can leave my beeper number with you in case... - [Maggie] Detective? Detective? - Be careful. What it! - What? - See this. - Oh, thank you. Listen, I'm sorry, I'm not usually like that. - Oh, well, in this business, we usually don't see people at their best anyway. - No, I mean I don't usually give up so easily. Listen, you don't think I'm totally crazy, do you? Don't you think there's something to my story? - Were you born like this? - Persistent? - No (laughing). - You mean blind. It was a playground accident when I was five. - Oh, that means you know what colors are. - Colors, textures, voices, odors. You know, I keep thinking if I could just remember everything that happened, that there's probably some detail that I'm forgetting that would be really important. But I don't know how to get it all back. If I could just make it replay. - Well, you know, memory is a very strange thing. It plays tricks on the best of us. - What if I could replay it? What if I was hypnotized? If I went to see a hypnotist? - [Mike] Aw, come on. - No, no, remember that little girl who was kidnapped from a preschool last year? They only way they got her back was the teacher remembered the car under hypnosis. - Yeah, but-- - Yeah. - Well, but I don't know. - Well, forget it, I'll find somebody who'll help me. - So how's your schedule tomorrow? - This is my schedule. Well, I like to walk. - It's nice here, and you usually get a breeze this time of day. - Was it a family illness? - [Mike] How's that? - You seem to be so familiar with the place. I thought maybe somebody in your family-- - Actually, it was me. - Nothing serious, I hope. - [Mike] Oh, they have an excellent alcohol recovery program here. - [Maggie] I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. - Not at all. I'm an alcoholic. I'll tell you what, though, staying sober is probably one of the major accomplishments of my life. Step up. - Gordon? Gordon? There's somebody in here. Somebody's in the house. Gordon, call the police. Gordon, Gordon, I know that somebody's in the house. (gagging) Oh, there's a smell. Oh. - [Hypnotist] Maggie, you still with me? - Yes. - [Hypnotist] Any time you want, Maggie. You know the way back. - Oh, there's a terrible smell. - [Hypnotist] What smell, Maggie? - I can't. Oh, oh I hear them. I hear them, the footsteps. One's heavy. One's heavy. - He has a limp? - A light foot and a heavy foot. We don't have any money! Oh, they're hurting Gordon. No, don't, don't. Stop, stop. Oh, oh, oh, oh. It's quiet, it's quiet. Where are they? Where are they? No! What are they doing? Gordon! Oh, oh, oh, it's quiet. It's quiet, quiet. Where are they, where are they? Oh God, I have to hide, I have to hide, I have to hide. Don't find me, don't find me, don't find me. Oh, don't hurt me, don't hurt me. Where are they? Don't find me. I can't hear them. I can't hear them. Where are they? They're leaving, they're leaving, they're leaving. I hear them, they're leaving, they're leaving. They broke a window. They broke the window. They broke the window. - Window, they broke the window on the way out? - They're gone, they're gone, they're gone. They're gone, is it safe? Can I go, can I go, can I go? Oh, I'm scared. Gordon, Gordon, Gordon. Gordon, Gordon. Gordon! Gordon! - [Hypnotist] It's all right. You're all right, Maggie. - No, no, no! No, no. No. - It's all right. - No. - [Hypnotist] You're all right Maggie. You don't have to do any more. - Hypnotist. What's it gonna be next, a psychic? You gonna requisition a Ouija board? - Couple of relevant details came out. Why would they break the glass on the way out? - Mrs. Kemlich, I want to apologize for this officer. What he did was completely unprofessional. - Well, I assure you it was my idea. - Yeah, well, if this detective were on line with the rest of the department, perhaps he'd have been aware that we have a confession in the Federal Heights murders. - [Mike] A confession? - He admitted to killing my husband? - Well, he's confessed to the Federal Heights murder, plus six other burglaries. It's only a matter of time before we tie him into your husband's death. - Did one of the men walk with a limp? - Mrs. Kemlich is certain one of the men in her house had an injury or some deformity of the leg. - I can testify to that fact. - Actually, Mrs. Kemlich, the county attorney and I have decided not to call you as a witness. - You're not going to call me as a witness in my husband's murder? - I really don't think that you have any idea how brutal the trial process can be. - Don't you insult me! - [Lieutenant] I don't mean this to be insulting. - My whole life I just wanted to be accepted as a normal person, and now you tell me that I'm an unreliable witness? - Mrs. Kemlich, please. - Please, don't please me. I can identify the men who killed my husband. The ones you arrested are the wrong men. - [Reporter] I'm here outside the County Hall of Justice with Margaret Kemlich. Mrs. Kemlich, in spite of the similarities to-- - Look, it's about us. - [Reporter] To the Federal Heights murders-- - Shut up. - You contend that police have the wrong men. - They're not the men who killed my husband. - [Reporter] Do you claim to have evidence to that effect? - What's she's saying? - Shut up! - The police presented a lineup to me, and I'm convinced that the men that they have in custody are not the men who broke in and murdered my husband. - What does that mean, Remy? - It means that you're a screw-up. It means that I gotta go back and do this thing right. Hey, pally! - Hey, man, you didn't tell me Remy was gonna be here. - Well, yeah, he had me bring you down here. - Where you been hidin' yourself lately? I been lookin' all over for you. - Been kinda down on my luck lately. Had to check into the VA for my pancreas. - [Remy] Oh you gotta take better care of yourself, Richard. - I hope you still ain't blaming me for that Kemlich screw-up, man. I mean, a safe that big, it had to be fat with somethin'. - [Remy] Listen, them's the breaks. - I could use kind of a good break right now, if you know what I mean. - Yeah? - The heat's been on pretty heavy, man. I kept my yap zipped good. - Uh huh. - Gotta be worth somethin'. - You little weasel, are you threatenin' to squeal on us? - I didn't threaten nothin'. - Hey! You take it easy, man. Don't be an idiot. Dickie ain't gonna squeal on us. Dickie's the one that left the door open. Dickie's the one that told us about the safe. Dickie's in deep as us. - All I want's a small bone, man. - Well, that's why I had this doofus bring you out here. I heard you was hard up. Thought maybe you could use a good day's work. - Yeah, man, I could-- - I got a guy who's gonna pay us 10 cents a pound to yank all the copper pipe we can out of this place. Sound good to you? - Yeah. - Go get the tools. They're in the back. - Yeah, thanks Remy. - Look at him. He's smilin' now. - Pipe? There ain't no copper pipe. Oh no, Remy, you're not gonna do him? No, dude, just scare him a little. He's gonna be no problem. - Yeah, just like the blind woman? You know, that wasn't supposed to be no problem either, and that's somethin' else I gotta go back and make right. - Nah, I don't like this. - You don't like it, huh? Well, let me tell you about something else that you're not gonna like. 'Cause in this state, when they execute you, before they take you down there, they make you put on these rubber underpants. How come you think they make you do that? Don't wanna die with rubber underpants on. You got it? - [Dickie] Yeah, I think this ought to do it. - Let's do it. - Hey, I appreciate this, Remy. - [Remy] Yeah, don't mention it. Let me tell you something, Richard. I heard about you sittin' there sweatin' and moanin' and groanin' that last little bit. I heard that while you was kinda layin' there you got delirious and maybe started talkin'. - No, man, I didn't say nothin'. I didn't say nothin'. - [Remy] I figured you did. - [Dickie] No, man, I didn't say nothin'. - [Remy] What you doing, Dickie? Get up from there. (shouting) (metal clanking) - I already told you the make and the year. It's just a very nice car. My husband kept it like it was new. - [Woman] Well, what about the color? - I don't know the color. - [Woman] You're selling a car and you don't know the color? How could you not know the color? - It's only me. - You just walk right in? - I'm sorry, but your secretary is away from her desk. - Sally. Sally. Oh, I forgot, she left early. All right, what can I do for you? - I'll tell you, you didn't exactly make a lot of friends in the justice community with your little TV cameo yesterday. - Well, when you can't get help through normal channels, what are you supposed to do? I am open to suggestions. - Okay, listen, I'm heading east toward your neighborhood. You want a lift? - Ron, good night. - Good night, Mag. - [Maggie] I accepted an offer on the house. I'm not living there anymore. - Well, that's good, that's good. But I'll take you there too. Wherever. - Look, is this some PR attempt to get me to shut up? - If you know anything about my reputation, you'd know I'm the last cop they'd ever assign to PR duty. So where's this new place? - I'll show you. I don't know if you remember my girlfriend Joanna. She redid one of the lofts across the street. The whole area's gentrifying. - [Mike] Yeah, gentrifying or horrifying. - It's not as far from everything as you'd think. It's near my office, and it's on two bus lines. The superintendent promised me he'll get this working right. Look out. I'm expecting the contractor. Kind of exciting to plan and design a whole space just for my exact needs. The view wasn't a selling point. The price was though. I'm not getting as much as I'd hope for for the house. - The hardest part of all this business isn't getting past the grief. It's dealing with the anger. - Cut out the amateur psychiatry, okay? - Look, lady, just a minute. You think that you're the only one around here who's suffered a tragedy? I'm sorry. - Are you married? Does this have anything to do with alcohol? Hey, wait a minute, you started this. You said I'm not the only one suffering from tragedy. What is it? - It's in the past. - As long as I live, Gordon will never just be in my past. Can't you tell me? - We'd pretty much given up hope that my wife would get pregnant, then all of a sudden she did right out of the blue. She was concerned about gaining weight, so I thought I'd get her a bike. Thought that'd be a good idea, and it seemed like a pretty good way to exercise. The guy that ran her down, ran them down, was pretty drunk according to the eyewitnesses and the look of his skid marks. He was probably drunk. One witness said it was a van, and another witness said it was a panel truck. So nobody really knew what it was. And I couldn't accept it. We didn't get him. It does have to do with my problem. What I'm trying to tell you is don't let the anger consume you. (footsteps thudding) - Mr. Langevine? - [Langevine] I hope I didn't keep you waiting. - [Maggie] No, no, you were right on time. - Good. - Mr. Langevine, this is Detective Tuthill. - Detective, hello. - Mr. Langevine. - Okay, you folks carry on. - You don't have to go. I wanted your ideas on some security. - Well, I've got a lot of work at the department. Maybe another time. - Fortunately, we don't have to deal with a lot of demolition. The bathroom would be right here, and to our left the kitchen. The counter is in the center, as you stipulated, and the bedroom-- - I hope you won't be offended, but I'm going to have to ask for references. - Oh, not at all. There are some real shysters out there. In fact, there's hangouts over on State Street where you can get day workers for minimum wage if that's what you want. - No, I want the best. Also, we should think about odors. Any aromatic material you can use. Cedar, redwood, any kind of fragrance. - Morning, Pat. - Your note on my screen said you wanted to see me. - [Lieutenant] Yeah, you ready for some real police work today? - That'd be fine by me. - Some kids found a John Doe floating in the lake out by Salt Air. I want you to light a fire under the coroner, find out whether we've got a homicide here or some bum who's laid down for the big snooze, all right? - Sure, Lieutenant. - I get any calls? - No, sir. - Look, I want to ask you something. Do you need a case number when you're calling up a file? Or can you just use the name and get it? - You can access it either way. What's the case? - Kemlich. - [Lieutenant] Tuthill, what am I gonna have to do to get you to leave this one alone? - You saw that woman at the lineup, she's impressive. - [Lieutenant] She's also attractive. - What the hell does that mean? - Listen, as far as this case is concerned, the file's been merged. - You mean closed? - No, I'm just saying that all the pertinent data has been transferred over to Federal Heights file. - What if I get anything new on the investigation? Then what? - Officially, there is no investigation. - Come on. - Without conclusive evidence that links these guys to the Kemlich murder. Look, the prosecutor wants a bulletproof case. The defense, they're trying to cut a deal. So what do you think we do? - A plea bargain. - Exactly. - Aw, that's ridiculous, Mag. You're not gonna feel at home with those men there. - Well, the tilers are supposed to finish up today. - Uh oh, officer. Here comes the short arm of the law. - Is that you, Tuthill? - Yeah, your secretary said I could find you down here. - Well, some day you're gonna bring me good news on this case. - Listen, I didn't want you to hear this on the news or get it from the paper somehow. - Just tell me. - Well, there's a deal been struck. The prosecution wants an airtight conviction, and the other side wanted to keep their guys from the death penalty. So in exchange for confessions in the Federal Heights murders, they're going to-- - They're dropping the charges in Gordon's murder? - That's right, yes. - You mean the men who killed my husband are gonna get away with it? - No. - Well, yes or no? - Well, okay, I know it's not right, but it's the best we can do. - The best you can do? What is this, some kind of new age justice? You're gonna wait around till their karma catches up with them? Well, I don't have that kinda patience. I'm gonna see that those two men get put away if I have to spend my life doing it. - Maggie. - Just press and they spring open. That way you're not groping for knobs. - That's truly inspired. - You'll like this around the corner. We're almost ready for your his and hers vanity basin. It's just an expression the decorators use. - One sink will be fine, thank you. - Okay, now around the corner to the right, again, you'll be heading for the kitchen. All right, now directly ahead is the island counter. It's almost finished. And above the vent is-- (hissing) (screaming) - What is that? What is that? - Mrs. Kemlich, are you all right? - I'm all right, what's that smell? What's that smell? - Once you start moving walls and doors around, I've known sighted clients who get all disoriented. - Well, it was that smell. - Well, I assure you there's nothing toxic. It's just the acid bath they use before they seal the tile. - It reminded me of something. Mr. Langevine. - Yes? - You mentioned a place where you can go to hire day laborers. - I understand you've got a budget, but that's no savings. - No, it's not for me, it's for a friend. - Most of the characters there I wouldn't put in my house. - My friend's a police officer. - If he's a cop, he probably knows the place. It's Ruthie's Hoagie Hut over on State Street. Half the creeps that hang out there have done hard time somewhere. - [Maggie] Hi, ready for lunch? There's a new place I wanna try. - It's only 11:45. - Well, I'm management, and this is a management decision. Come on, lunch. - [Joanna] Whoever recommended this place to you played a really lousy trick on you, Maggie. - Testing, testing, one, two, three. Testing, one, two, three. - Maggie, what's goin' on? - Okay, it's recording. Joanna, I want you to take this, and I want you to go in there and talk to those men. - Are you crazy? - No, I want you to go in and ask anybody if they're a tile man. Ask around for a tile man, and just get them talking. - Do the police know you're doing this? - If the police were any help, I wouldn't be here, and I wouldn't be asking you to help me. Please, Joanna, just try it, okay? Get some voice samples. Just talk to them, it can't hurt anything. - Sure, sure. - Okay, good. That's good, go on. Thank you. - Excuse me, do you know where I might be able to find a man who does tile? Hi, I'm looking for a man that does tile work. - Right here. - Hey, I can do it. - [Laborer] Kitchens or bathrooms? - No, just regular counter tile. I'm looking for one man in particular. (men shouting over each other) - [Laborer] It's my specialty, lady. - [Laborer] Hey, lady. - What's wrong? - Hey. - Wait a minute. What if he knows something? - Are you lookin' for tile guys? - I'm looking for two guys in particular. - I know lots of good guys. - One of them has a bad leg. He walks with a limp or something. - Could be I know a couple of guys that fit that description. - Got their number? - They don't have phone numbers. I'll try and track 'em down for you. - [Maggie] I'll get in touch. - Check back in a couple of days. - [Remy] Yeah. - Yeah, I'm lookin' for tile work. Hey, if there's a pay day in this don't forget your friends. What do you mean? I know tile, leastwise good enough for this job. The broad's blind. Hey, you there? Remy? - I mean, if you could've seen the way that man was looking at you. Maggie, this is police stuff. - Police stuff? You know how much help the police have been. The only way to get results from those people is to drop it in their laps. - This is not skiing or rock climbing, Maggie. There's no safety line here. I'm scared of what might happen. I don't want to do this. My God, Maggie, they killed Gordon. - [Wiggins] Not the agreement that we had. Look, you gotta tell me something. Hold on a second, Mike. Hold on one second, Mike. - Hello, Maggie. - She couldn't hold any longer. - What's this? - That's the place she said. Down on State Street. She's on her way there now. - [Driver] Here we are. - Thank you. - Yes, ma'am. - Keep the meter running. Could you point me in the right direction? - Over here, this way. - Thank you. - Ma'am, it's me. I'm the one you talked to about the tile job. - Yes, did you locate the two men I described? - Well, how many guys did you need? We got a lot of guys that need some work. - No, I don't care about those guys. I told you I was-- - [Mike] Maggie, it's me. - What? - Come on, let's go. - Let me go. - You can't stay here. - What are you doing? - It's not safe here. - I am perfectly-- - What are you crazy? Or do you think you're the Lone Ranger or something? - Are you crazy? I found out something. - Fine, fine, but it's my job-- - That lady with the cop. - Come on. - Listen to me. At the loft, they were working on tiles and I smelled it. And there was this solution that smelled like formaldehyde. - Yes, yes. - You know how I kept saying something smelled like death? Well, that's it - Right, fine. - The men who killed Gordon must've been working on tile. Are you listening to me? - Yes, yes, fine. They work on tile. - Well, that's what I was talking to him about. And there are two men he feels fit the description. So I came back to see if I could find them. - Well, great, and suppose they showed up. Then what? - Well, I thought maybe if they knew somebody was on to them, they'd do something rash. - Like what, leave the scene? Then I could get 'em for a traffic violation. That's great. Listen, you need evidence to convict somebody. You need testimony. You need eyewitness accounts. - I thought you believed in me. - I do believe in you, but when you go off like a loose cannon it's not safe. You can get hurt. And next time you get an inspiration like this, talk to me about it, because if I catch you freelancing around again, I'm gonna lock you up. Believe me, I got the laws that can do it too. - Well, the law hasn't done me any good. - Hey, lady, what are you doing? - You don't happen to remember where you picked her up at? - Maggie, you okay? - Yes. - It's almost seven o'clock. - I was just trying to finish up these personnel reports. - You look really weary. Maybe you ought to just pack it in for the night. - Yeah, maybe I will. Oh! (tearing) (electrical buzzing) - [Kid] I'm gonna get you! - Are you all right? - Oh please, leave me alone. (breathing heavily) Hello, anybody? - [Remy] You lookin' for me? Hey, sugar, you looking for me, huh? You got a barrel right there. Whoa. - What are you doing? - Who me? What am I doing? I don't know, what are you doing? You go shopping? You go shopping? What'd you buy? You get me something? You got a step. Step, step, step, step up. Yeah, you don't want to fall down. What are you doing, you going faster now? You been shopping? You get me something? What'd you get me, huh? You're about to run into another curb over there. Watch out for the curb, oh, watch out for the curb. What do you got, a specially designed car for the blind down there? Oh yes, you got another curb coming up here. I would watch out if I was you. Yes, I would. Oh, did you hurt yourself? I'm so sorry about that, should've warned you there. Look out. I would look out and be very careful if I was you. Look out, look out. I tell you what, I would look out. Look out, look out. (screaming) Look out, look out! (tires screeching) - Ma'am, are you all right? You okay? - [Remy] Stupid! - [Bystander] You maniac, are you ought of your mind? - [Remy] Stupid! Go! - I don't know, Remy, this is just too much for me. I say we blow this place. Don't you want to see Vegas, Phoenix, California? - What do we have to go anywhere for? There's only one broad that can pin this thing on us. We already know where she works. How long's it gonna take to figure out where she lives? - I don't know, Remy. - [Remy] Shut up and drive. (crowd chattering) - [Officer] Hi, Mrs. Kemlich, its Officer Jones here. I just have a few questions to ask you about the accident. - Mrs. Kemlich, you all right? - Hi, Lieutenant. - Mrs. Kemlich was turned around, then she was knocked down by a vehicle. - It was the men who killed my husband. I recognized the footsteps, and then one of them threatened me. - Jim, Jim, move this car. - I'm awfully sorry, ma'am. But all the other driver could tell us was that it was an American-made van. I believe these are yours. - Thank you. - Yes. - Mrs. Kemlich. - Yes, you know, the men know that I can identify them, and now they're coming after me. - We have the men locked up. Mrs. Kemlich, you're a very accomplished lady, but you've been under a lot of stress lately. Let me give the telephone number of our crime victim's hotline. You can call-- - Are you writing me off as some kind of psycho case? - No I'm, listen let me have my driver give you a ride home. - I don't need a ride, and I don't need your hotline number. I'll manage from here on my own, thank you. - Just say with her, will you please? - You can get key controls for the elevator and lock-out panels for the floor. - [Maggie] Good, I'd like you to get started on that. - What about the other tenants? It's not fair that you should take on the whole expense. - Well, I'd also like locks, the very best locks. Two of them. - Double deadbolts? - [Maggie] Yes. - I'll look into estimates. - Oh, don't bother. Could you get started on it right away? - Are you sure you're gonna be all right? I can't tell whether we're building a home here or a fortress. - I'm fine, It's just I'm on my own, and I think that I need more security. Just get started on it right away. - Okay. - [Man] We'll shoot the stuff and then go home. What do you say? - Sure. - Well, if you ever have any slack time up there in personnel, why don't you come down and work for me? This would be a snap for you. What can I do for you? - My nephew wanted me to ask you about photo flashes. - Photo flashes. - Solderless connectors. Let's see, terminal boxes, friction tape, couplers, and I'm gonna need shielded cable, about 300 feet. Can you pull that from stock for me? - Sure, but if you don't mind my asking, what are you gonna do with all this stuff? - Oh, just a couple security projects around my new place. By the way, what's the status on the video recorder? My nephew wants to make some kind of drama project in the loft. - Well, it's all being repaired. It'll be back tomorrow. If you want, I can leave it at your office. - I'm taking a few days off, Jesse. Is there any way you can bring it by my place? - For you, Mrs. Kemlich, no problem at all. - All right, thanks. - Bye. - It wasn't the locks that were the real expense, it was the overtime and special order that really broke the bank. - Well, you've been absolutely wonderful to me. Thank you. I know I've been difficult. - Difficult, no. Worrisome, yes. I keep bugging the superintendent about the elevator, and he assures me that he'll have people up to fix it. - Well, it's fine as long as I can lock it. - If there's anything else I can do-- - Could I borrow some tools? There's some things I need to hang. - A hammer, screwdriver? - Mhm and needle-nose pliers, a crescent wrench, a pinch bar. (phone ringing) - [Machine] Hi, this is Maggie. Please leave a message at the beep. - [Mike] Hello, Maggie, this is Mike Tuthill. You there? They said at the office you were taking a couple days off. Are you okay? Now, listen, if there's anything I can do, you can reach me at the station. Call me, huh? Just let me know you're okay. - Hey, Mike, I really owe you one. You made me look like a genius on that John Doe that washed up in the lake. That was a smart call on the tattoo. - Well, it's a good idea with transients. Any time you see a service tattoo, always check the VA hospitals. - Yeah, well the doctors knew him, all right. His name was Richard Parker. They called him Dickie. - Did they get an address? - Nope. He did tile and handiwork though. The closest thing was that snack stand down on State Street. You know, where all the gypsy labor hangs out. (phone ringing) - [Machine] Hi, this is Maggie. Please leave a message at the beep. (dial tone droning) - Hello? Maggie? Hello, Maggie? Yeah, hi, it's Tuthill. Are there any messages for me? Nothing? Anything from Mrs. Kemlich? Okay, thanks. (thudding) - Tuthill? Tuthill? Oh please, Tuthill. (buzzing) (electrical buzzing) - Something's wrong, it won't open. I got a parcel here for a Mrs. Kemlich, if you'll just sign off. - Will you bag it? She's right there. She knows exactly who we are. Hey, you stupid bimbo. You really think you're gonna keep me out of here with this Mickey Mouse setup, huh? Huh? Talk to me. Huh? Okay, okay, what do you want? - I thought you might like to see. (flashes clicking) (shouting) - [Remy] My eyes! Oh, that's a good one, lady. You gonna pay big time. - How does that feel? Tell me, I wanna know, how do you like it? - I'll tell you how I like it. - [Burglar] What the hell do you want? - Just keep talking. - Believe me, lady. - [Remy] Shut up, you hear me? Shut up. - She's gonna kill us. - Shut up. (electrical buzzing) - We know where she lives. We can get to her. Come on, let's just go. We can come back here. Let's just get out of here. - You're not going anywhere! (electrical buzzing) (shouting) - I have to tell that I'm real educated in misery. I know ways to hurt you that you can't begin to imagine. - How else could you hurt me? - [Burglar] Lady, he didn't mean to kill your husband. - [Remy] I said shut up. - [Burglar] We can plea bargain, manslaughter, something. - Shut up or I'll kill you! - We did it, we did it! (metallic clanking) (shouting) - Okay, all right, okay, okay, okay. Just calm down. Now, you really think you got this thing wired, don't you? Huh, dollface? Oh, that was close, but not quite. What was his name, huh? Let's see his name. Gordon, wasn't that it? Good old Gordon. - Just keep talking. - Good old Gordy. Well, let's just say that I did ax him. I have to tell you, though, I really did like it. Something's wrong with me, because I liked it when he was twitching and jerking all over and I jerked right in-- (electrical buzzing) (shouting) You witch. - You'll pay for this! - How am I gonna pay for it? With what? With this stupid video setup that you got up here? - [Maggie] You're gonna pay for this! - I don't know that you've got this place wired. Surprise, dollface, there ain't no court gonna convict me on a conviction under these kinda circumstances. Yeah, yeah, why don't you try it again? Right here, baby, right here. Get it through here, yeah, yeah. (electrical buzzing) (shouting) - No! - That's it! - No! - [Remy] I'll be back, baby. - No, no, no! - [Remy] Don't you worry. - [Maggie] No. (crying) Tuthill? Tuthill? - Hello, lover. (screaming) You come here to me. You get back here, baby. - Tuthill! Help me, Tuthill! Tuthill, Tuthill, Tuthill! Help me! - You're coming with me, baby. It's the end for you, baby. Hey, baby, I got somethin' for you you're gonna love. (gunshot banging) (shouting) (gunshot banging) (glass shattering) (gunshot banging) (gunshot banging) (gunshot banging) (scuffling) Get away from me! (choking) - Shoot, shoot. He's right above me. Shoot, shoot. Shoot! - I can't. - [Mike] He's right here. Here's right above me. Shoot! (gunshot banging) - Tuthill? Tuthill? - It's me. It's me. It's me. - All you all right? All you all right? - I'm okay. It's over, it's all over. (somber music)
