So, we've arrived. This is a special place. In this forest of Brocéliande, centuries ago, lived seven fairies. Each more beautiful and mysterious than the other. They'd sworn they'd stay pure and would never appear before men. The younger one, out of curiosity, broke the oath, and one day appeared before a knight who'd come by the lake to water his horse. When the other fairies learned about it, fearing they'd be discovered, they decided to murder the knight. Which was done. The little one, mad with grief, wandered for weeks around Brocéliande forest, day and night, trying here and there to find the phantom of the knight. To no avail. And then, one day, or maybe one night, here, in this very place, she cut the throats of her six sisters to collect their blood to concoct a potion that would bring her lover back to life. The Stranger from Brocéliande Come on. Shit, I've had enough. I've had enough, Marie. I swear I can't stand it anymore. What is a couple to you? Each one doing his own thing? We don't talk anymore. Don't share anymore. I don't identify with that. I want that to be clear. I've always been there for you. If something's wrong, say so! If you continue to clam up it means you don't trust me. If you don't trust me, it won't work. Understand? You don't get it. Shit. OK. Let's go. Move it. - Captain. - Lieutenant. Well? The girl's here. Lucie Bonheur, she's 10. - We wanted you to talk to her. - OK. - And the body? - 300 m away. Forensics and PTS are there. You and Marie can deal with them. I'll see the girl. I don't want this to go public. Talk to your father. Thanks. Captain Eric Jourdain. I'm in charge of the investigation. Are you Lucie? I need you to tell me what happened. OK? Why were you alone in the woods? You'd heard enough of the guide's stories? I get it. They're scary. It's not my fault. He called me. Who is "he"? A boy. He asked me to follow him. What was he like? Can you describe him? How old was he? I shouldn't have followed him. That's OK, honey. Answer the captain. Don't worry. Tell us what you saw, it will help us. I didn't see him clearly, he was dirty, his clothes were torn. - OK. Thanks, Lucie. That's great. The boss looks tense this morning. A body's been found. That's the only reason? You want to know if everything is OK between us? - Hello, Marie. - Hi. The body burned for several hours. We're lucky it's intact. It wasn't torn apart by wild animals. - Hello, Isabelle. - Hello. I see! Is it a man or a woman? A man, given the size of the skull. 20 to 45 years old. The charring indicates he was burned here. He didn't get here alone. Cause of death? It'll need confirming, but he was hit on the head. Right there. Date of death? One week max. We'll know after the autopsy. Keep me updated. A boy guided Lucie to the corpse. He might know something. Dirty, torn clothes. He's somewhere in the woods. Let's go look for him. The dogs are following a trail to the south. I repeat. South of the body. We have someone. We've found him. Hold the dog! Come here, young man. It's OK. Come here. Don't worry. It's alright. It's OK. Come on. Hey! OK. Thanks. Nothing on the boy's picture. It fits no missing person. And the victim? Nothing either. Jourdain, the report. Yes, sir. We have to know who he is. A local or a passerby. Elodie, rake the sector, every hotel. Are you OK? Are you thirsty? Here. You still don't want to talk? Won't you tell me your name so I can find your parents? We'll go to the hospital later, to make sure you're alright. OK? You draw really well. Can I see? These are Trégortin castle's ruins. Well, I... I'll leave you alone. OK? Here. You're pissing me off! If you find a lead, you tell me. I left a note on your desk. - We could stop working together. - Take it easy. The boy slept here. Maybe for several days. Look. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - You didn't have to. It's for a kid. I'm Romain... I know. Come. - Who's the kid's liaison? - Marie. The only one to get close to him. He ran when we found him... Enough. I get it. Hello. My name is Romain Delorme. I'm a child psychiatrist, Marie Delorme's brother. Lieutenant Marie Delorme. She asked me to take care of you until we find your parents. Wow, you're good at drawing. I thought you'd be hungry. I don't know what you like, so I got a selection. Fritto misto, some pizza, and here, dessert: panacotta with red berries. Pizza. Alright? Do you mind if I take a slice? I haven't eaten... I thought we could share. OK. I'll take silence to mean "yes". What's he doing? Relying on his senses, food is basic. Step one to get a kid out of a state of shock. How do you know that? How do I... Sorry, I don't get the question. Because I'm a woman... Explain yourself. You'll see, it's delicious. Leave some for me. Make yourself at home! - Captain. - Hello. Ah, little sister! - Thanks for coming so fast. - You saw the kid? His silence is due to trauma. He's afraid. We have to know of what, of who. What's your plan? He must learn to trust again. I'll take care of him, but I'll need the first person he relied on. Me? Shall we go to the hospital? If I was a shrink I'd say you're more nervous than usual. Not at all. Even your body language says you're in denial when you say: "Not at all". What's going on with Eric? I'm just worried about the kid, OK? Whatever he's been through, he'll have to deal with it. Put into words what's hurting him. Understand? Yes, give it a rest. Have you split up with Eric? Sleeping at your place will complicate matters. - I'll get a hotel. - Fine. - What happened? - Nothing in particular. It's just like that. I have the results. No physical or sexual abuse. He's dehydrated and undernourished, but otherwise he's OK. Is there something we can use? Yes. The boy is O positive, and the victim's blood group is A. No parentage is possible. - OK - Thanks. - Do you know a children's home? - Champagnac. It is ours. Who was the last person to borrow it? My computer says it is here. It must have been stolen. Do you know this boy? Yes. It's Kilian. - Surname? - No idea. He's always drawing or looking at King Arthur books. He's never borrowed a book. I'm sorry. Don't be. Can we keep the book? - Sure. - Thanks. - Thanks. - See you. Kilian... Super, that'll be useful. He couldn't have... A less common name. At least we've got a name. Marie said things were difficult between you. Really? If you need a place to crash, don't hesitate. - You mean your place? - Yes. - With the most honorable intentions. - Sure. Thanks, but no. I'll be fine. Thanks. It's the only room available in the area. See you tomorrow. Off you go. Yes, yes. Hi. How's it going? Fine. I've put you in room... 12. You'll be OK. It's small, but it overlooks the garden. It's nice to see you other than at Christmas and on birthdays. I came for work. Good night. We checked everything: hotels, cottages, parking lots... There's nothing. We missed something. I guess he was killed, burned elsewhere and then brought to the woods. When this goes public we'll get crazy calls. We're in deep shit. - Eric... - What? Isn't this what you want? I want to be happy. You OK? Yes, I'm fine. I took the last room. Your dad is setting up a camp bed in the office. Want to talk? No, but I'd like a drink. Do you think Kilian witnessed it? He draws fighting dragons. Victim dragon, aggressor dragon, cremation... Is that a yes? All he draws is in the book. You took it from the seals? No. From dad's library. There's Trégortin castle, the Druids' tomb, where we found him, even the Fairies' Mirror where he met Lucie. His memories relate to the book? All his drawings are in the book, except one. This one. It is the most detailed. There's emotional violence. I think this drawing means something special. He invented it? No, he didn't. It's engraved in Saint-Aubin church and tells an episode of Merlin's childhood. You remember nothing about the legends I used to tell you. No. I was more down to earth. Then listen now... Vortigern got hold of Bretagne's throne by getting rid of his heirs. He even killed a son of his. But he had more powerful enemies, like Uther Pendragon. To protect himself from the latter, he built an immense tower. The problem was that the tower crumbled every night. When does Merlin appear? Can I continue? Vortigern was perplexed until the day a 7-year-old boy, Merlin, told him that two dragons lived underneath the tower: one white, the other red, and they fought every night. So they dug and found the two dragons, a white one and a red one. And the white one killed the red one. The little boy, Merlin, then told Vortigern that he was the red dragon, while Uther Pendragon was the white one. No! Not fire! No! Not this! Not fire! No! Not fire! No! - Kilian? - Not fire! It's just a nightmare. It's over. Easy. You're safe here. - Michel, call doctor Delorme. - Leave me. He's gonna kill me! - No. - Who? The white dragon. - No, not this. - It's OK. He was burning, panicked. It's normal. Night terrors. Impressive, but... it's normal. - Am I doing the right thing? - Yes. Don't worry. He's shocked. He needs time. Hello, Kilian. Hello. I'll get you some toast. You OK? She says you have nightmares. It's normal. Witnessing a crime is traumatic. I can help you if you talk to me. Look what I've brought. Drawing paper. And there's more. Felts. For you, draw what you want. What you fear or hurts you, anything. And then you can show me the drawings and we can talk. Thanks. - Hi. - Hi. You don't look good. I slept badly. Here, look. - They look alike. - They do. - Good morning. - Good morning. Vortigern's tower... It sealed Merlin's fate with Pendragon. I'm fond of this engraving. You're here on holidays? We're Mauron police. Do you know this kid? Kilian Morvan, the son of our housekeeper, Gwenn. - Do you know where she is? At the presbytery. You don't look after your son? So what? I was working at a music festival. Kilian was with my man. What's up? Take it easy. We found your kid in the woods. He witnessed a murder. - Where is he? - He's safe. Wait. We have some questions. Who's your man? I'll answer when I've seen my son. Miss Morvan, we can talk. You have to understand. It's hard. She works hard to raise her kid. - But she's alone. - Why? Her boyfriend doesn't have a good influence on Kilian. Who is he? What's his name? All I know is he's called Franck. He's 25. What does he look like? 1,80 m, average build. He's got a scar on his forehead. You know him? Franck Corbet? Aren't they nice? They're my father's. Which one would you be? I'm King Arthur, the mightiest one. And you? Merlin. The savviest one. And the one who best knows the dragons. Take it. It's a gift. I drew this for you. Thanks. Franck Corbet. We know him. Burglary, car theft, concealment... Check if he still works at the garage. I have. They last saw him on the 24th. Almost a week ago. It may fit. - Find his address. - What's your theory? Corbet is the victim and Kilian killed him? I have no theory. I'm checking what we have. Checking he's really her man? We know that. Why would he kill him? Why are you mad? I'm just doing my job. Recognize this? Could it be in the woods? Ask the expert, papa Yvon. Someone else must know the forest. As well as he does? There are Internet petitions, too. I hope I'll get the president himself when we reach 100,000. I was on the news on channel 3, you know. Yeah. Fuck! I've been struggling for 10 years. I won't stop. It's a disgrace. Calling this marvelous place Paimpont forest. It's Brocéliande forest... Who cares? Yes, Dad, who cares? It's there. Hey! It's over there. Isn't this gorgeous? Eh? Fuck. You don't get it, assholes. - Marie! - What? Come see. Is it because of this dough that the guy got killed? We'll have to sweep the area. I'll call forensics. We found your tree. We went to the woods and found it. There were signs of a fight. We even found some money. 8,000 euros. What happened in the woods? I don't know. But you didn't make the tree up. You saw it. Look what we found during the sweep. I've just been shouted at. What do we have? Corbet disappeared on the 24th, maybe the day of the murder. His description fits the victim. And we found 8,000 euros Kilian was the last to see him. He couldn't have killed Corbet. I don't like the idea, but it cannot be discarded. - I don't think he did it. - Why? Traumatism is passive. You cannot kill and be shocked. - I'll question him. - No. - Why? - He's opening up. If you pressure him, we'll get nowhere. OK. Let's check the keys. We'll find the owner with the brand and serial number. Go. Thanks. I know I ask you hard questions. - Merlin would have helped. - Merlin, sure. You're not Merlin, though. And I'm not Arthur either. Whatever happened, I know that you're a victim. OK? - Can I go? - Yes. - Hi, Isa. - Hi. The autopsy report. I wanted to bring it myself. You live round the corner. The killer made identification impossible. No prints, no identifiable clothes. In short: nothing. Anything on the causes of death? Mortal blow on the right temple, ante mortem blows on the left knee and tibia. The right-handed killer hit him in the left leg, the victim knelt and received a blow on the temple. Anyone with a good club could have done it. You mean even a teenager? Once the victim is kneeling, it's easy to hit the head. - Do you know the time of death? - Yes. Friday the 24th between 12 and 6 pm. The 24th? It fits Franck Corbet's disappearance. It does. Many images refer to fire and smoke. I'm trying to understand what they represent. Do you think it could be linked to his father? We inherited my grandparents' place. We had no money to renew it. But we didn't care, we were fine. And one night there was a fire. I went outside with Kilian. Steph wanted to get some stuff. How old was Kilian? Four. Is all the talk about Franck true? That he's responsible for what happened to Kilian? He used Kilian for trafficking. That's all we know. I always end up with assholes. You're not very lucky. I'm not a bad mother. No. You're just overwhelmed, like 90 % of moms. Kilian will need you when he gets home. You have to encourage him, be there for him. The boy is pretty weird. - Maybe he's pretending. - No. His crises, traumas... Don't you think? - No. - Tell me why. Because. Can't you elaborate a bit? He won't answer. After 20 years I don't know what I did wrong. Hello? Miss Champagnac. When did you realize? He could say why he's mad, but he won't. Everything I do or say annoys him. Shit! Good. I have to go. What's wrong? Nothing. I have to go. There you go. - He found me. - Who? Franck. He was in front of the house. He wants to hurt me. Don't be afraid to talk. Was he with you in the woods? - I don't know. - How come? Answer, don't tell me you don't know. You saw what happened. You don't get it. I'm crazy. I only remember two dragons fighting. Real dragons. What's wrong with my head? Romain, it's me. Kilian is here. I reckoned he would be. That's it, yes. Wait, someone's knocking. You can hang up. - Where is he? - Upstairs, in the office. He just fell asleep. He's scared to death. He thinks he's crazy. All he saw are two dragons fighting. You two match. Why? Stop your shrink bullshit. I'm fed up with it. Kilian saw Corbet and ran away. Maybe he made that up to cover his tracks. That's why Eric wants to question him. This boy is not guilty. What about the dragon story? The brain creates screen-memories to cope with trauma. At first, these memories protect you from reality, but you have to dissolve them and accept them as they are. What if you do nothing? They resurface violently, we don't know how. I think it's normal. Some events revive these traumas. - I think it's your case. - What do you mean? You're doing it again. No. I know you. You've restarted scarifications. I've moved on. Do the same. You became a cop to hunt the bad guys, I became a shrink to heal children. Your scars, depression, anorexia, it's just a coincidence? You have to talk to me, trust me, trust Eric. Through this kid you're trying to save yourself. You ask him to face this while you run away... Romain! Do you recognize him? It's Franck Corbet, your mom's boyfriend. No one has seen him since the murder. I saw him. I know. The problem is you're the only one. I'm not lying. What happened in the woods? - I can't tell. - You can't or you won't? I'll tell you what happened. You had to give him an envelope. You didn't want to hand him the money your mom needed. So you fought, you hit him with a stick and he died. I didn't kill him. Can you come? Corbet used his debit card yesterday in a bar. We showed his picture in hotels. He's in the interview room. How's Franckie doing? - Hello. - We haven't seen you in a while. You know why you're here? No idea? No? Let me tell you. We have a problem: we found a corpse in the woods and 8,000 euros that belong to you. And you vanished on the very day of the murder. - See what I mean? - Wait... No, no. You are polite and you answer my questions. Sorry, are you trying to hang that corpse on me? - I'm hanging the corpse on you. - I'm innocent. You're innocent, as usual. Tell me why you vanished on the day of the murder. Because of Big Joe. I know, but the dough was for him. And that stupid kid took my money... What was I supposed... What was I supposed to do, sir? "Big Joe..." Give us Big Joe's full name and address. I'm sorry. I don't know that. Let me ask again. You will give us Big Joe's address or I charge you with murder. Get it? Kilian went for the dough because I was at Pontivy's houses. I can give you all the addresses. You'll regret it if you're lying. We've known each other for a while, we can be honest, right? You'd better be. Right? Who's lying, Kilian or this bastard? Why would Kilian take Lucie to the body? Maybe he felt guilty. He killed him by accident, burned him, panicked, regretted it and guided us to him. He's innocent. Marie, Eric... The victim's blood is on the keys you found. They belong to Mathieu Le Guennec, saw miller. His wife says he's out of town. Take a look. One of his farms burned last month: arson. OK. Show Corbet a picture, ask if he's "Big Joe". Show Kilian the picture, see if he knows him. No. It's not the right time. - Are these your husband's? - Why do you have them? We found them in Paimpont forest. He told me he'd be away longer than expected. He sent me an SMS. Look at the time. It was sent after the victim's death. This means the boy killed him, kept the phone and sent an SMS so no one would worry? Not bad for a 13-year-old. Yes, it makes no sense. Mrs. Le Guennec, your husband's been gone a while and you don't mind? He sometimes leaves alone to chill. Mathieu works a lot. We need a personal object. And we'll keep this. Give us a toothbrush or a comb, for DNA matching. - What's wrong? - I'm fine. When you vomit, you're fine, right. - I'm pregnant. - What? It's not the best time to tell you. No, no. That's super. Please, go back inside. There are so many pictures of her husband, a narcissistic pervert. Now I understand why you were so nervous. - Please... - OK. Well, stay here. I will... OK. Here's a picture. We think he's the victim. It's him. Fine. Now you're coping. I'm proud of you. Hello. Can I help? Police. We want to talk to the manager. You can talk to Mr. Carteron. - Great. - Can you call him? He's inspecting the machines. - That way? - Yes. Mr. Carteron? Hello. Hello. Captain Jourdain, lieutenant Delorme. Can you turn this off? I need to talk to you. Hey! Ho! What is it? We need your administrative files. Murder investigation, it could be Le Guennec. I don't get it. Was there a fire a month ago? It was arson. Do you think someone might have wanted to burn Le Guennec's warehouse? Maybe a client? A supplier? An employee? How did he treat his employees? What do you mean? No one here loathed Mr. Le Guennec. He was a flawless boss. Don't you agree, miss? Eh, nothing... Please, it could be important. Some people say, not me, but... Yes? That Mr. Le Guennec was mainly kind to those who were kind to him. Mr. Carteron, client, supplies and staff files, I want them this afternoon. You'll take care of that? Yes, sure. Thanks. Well, back to work! Hey! Ho! Come on! OK. OK. Thanks. It's Pontivy police, confirming the burglaries. The stuff found at Corbet's matches the minutes. He's not the murderer. Shit! - You're feeling bad? - No, it's... - I'll take you home. - No. Nausea won't kill me. I'm just pregnant. Marie, what will you do with the baby? I don't know. It's a good sign, don't you think? Kilian recognized Le Guennec. Eric, I have the DNA test. Le Guennec is the victim. Now we know who the victim is. But who killed him? Not the workers. They say he was authoritarian but honest. No one stands out? Her maybe, Nathalie Alami, his assistant. She's been absent one month. She might know something. Shall we go see her? Yes. Listen... I'm sorry. I want to keep the baby. And I want you to come back home. I... Yes, I agree. I'll be a good father. Come on. - Mr. Le Guennec was murdered. - Really? - Who did it? - We don't know yet. You were his assistant. Did he have any enemies? No. He was a good boss. Yet someone set fire to his farm in Rennes. Why are you on sick leave? I had a burn-out. I worked too much, I was tense, I'm too perfectionist. Did you have an affair with Le Guennec? I was unemployed for 5 years, I was miserable, he was there, supportive, so supportive... - That you became lovers. You had a burn-out when you wanted to stop but he didn't? He said he'd fire me. I couldn't let it get out. Did your husband know? - Was he the arsonist? - No, it was me. I can't picture you lighting a fire, let alone killing your boss. But Mehdi wouldn't. I swear. Yes, he did set light to it. Le Guennec dropped charges. Where can we find your husband? Working at the Marin' Boël restaurant. I advise you not to tell him we're coming. Good morning. We're closed. Come back later. We want to see Mehdi Alami. - What for? - Police investigation. Don't move! Don't move, asshole! Are you crazy? Let's go! Ouch! - I look stupid, right? - No. You're pregnant and you shackle him. I fell over like a loser. I am doped with hormones. You have concussion. They'll keep you in for 24 hours. I won't sleep here. I'm fine. Take it easy. I'll come back tomorrow. - Do you know him? - He's my wife's boss. He was murdered. - You knew that already. - No, I didn't. - How could I know? - Because you killed him. What? I killed no one. You run away for no reason. Your wife told us you set the fire. So? That's why you ran? Le Guennec said he'd drop charges. When I saw you I thought he'd changed his mind. The dropped charges drove you crazy. I didn't kill him. I calmed down. What was Le Guennec like? He was a pervert. He was wicked. Why? Because he seduced your wife? No, because he manipulated her. He made her stay late because she'd screwed up, he stayed to help. He'd set it up, he even brought drinks. And when she was dizzy, the mother fucker raped her. - He used drugs? - I don't know. When Nathalie finally admitted it, there were no traces in her blood. - That's a motive. - It wasn't me. What about Le Guennec and other women? She wasn't the first one. Did he take pictures? Can we focus on circumstances? Did he take pictures? How do you know that? Nathalie can't have told you. Where were you on Friday the 24th at noon? I was in... in Angers. That's it, it was the 24th. I want to buy a café there and leave this awful place. What about the pictures? - What? - Le Guennec is a serial rapist. - Are you sure? That's the motive. We have to search his place. Do you know what you're up to? You don't search a bigwig on a whim. I know what I'm doing. OK. I'll call the judge. Tomorrow morning should be good. Go home. It's late. - How did you know about the photos? - A bluff. Yes, Romain. Right away? OK. I'm coming. - You OK? - Remember Corinne Delage? Oh, she was stupid! That's why you called me? I was in love with her. She wasn't a big deal. I made a Brazilian strap for her. She left me before I gave it to her. I gave it to you. - You wouldn't take it off. - Really? I don't remember. Tell me why it was in the seals. - It's not the same one. - Red, "R", orange, "O", brown "M", blue, ivory, black... Romain! Le Guennec... did he rape you? He raped you. Shit, he raped you. - Dad! - Yes? Can you please come? Yes. What's up? - Do you know Le Guennec? - I do. A straight guy. One of the first to sign... He raped Marie when she was 14. - Don't start over again. - I'll continue. Speak. - No. - He raped you. Tell him. He raped you and kept this as a trophy. It's easier to worry about the forest than your daughter. What? You're good, Marie. You're sweet. Are you sure? I am. If you'd seen yourself riding... - Thanks. - Shall we do it again tomorrow? Yes, sure. Wait, Marie, let me help. Like this. Stop, Mathieu. I'm stuck. Stop, you frighten me. It's fine. I love this, feeling fear. Come here. - You want coffee? - No, thanks. What are you doing? Can I help you? Kilian keeps drawing attacking dragons and women characters in white. - So what? I think the killer is a woman. No text talks about female dragons. There are dragon eggs, but... Dad... Dad, I think the killer is a woman and she's one of his old victims. Marie would never do that. - How do you know? - Because she's my daughter. And if Le Guennec is a rapist, there were other victims. Not just Marie. It wasn't necessarily Marie. It was just a guess. Wait, Wait. Listen, Romain. I... I... - I never... - You never wanted to know. You never wanted to know. You prefer legends to real life, to family, us. - But I always loved you. - Then prove it. Now. Marie needs us right now. My husband is the victim, he's not guilty. This search is pointless. Tell the judge. Search the room. Guys, go upstairs. I'll call your boss and tell him about this harassment. Major Morlet, 15 rue Mathurin, Mauron. You'll find nothing. Elodie! Yes. - Where are you? - In the office. What do you have? Is your husband still that innocent? Follow me, Mrs. Le Guennec. We found what we were after. You coming? Yes, I'm coming. Kilian, could the white dragon be a woman? I don't know. This is an important question. Close your eyes, focus and visualize the white dragon. Is it a man or a woman? Take a good look. Is the dragon Marie? Do you maintain you ignored your husband's sexual deviances? - I knew nothing. - You knew nothing. Look. 21 women. 21 pictures. I'm not involved in his death. I wasn't aware of the pictures or what he did with the girls. Some are from the 80s. You noticed nothing? "Noticed" what? That he didn't look at me, came home late, yes. But I thought it was my fault, that I wasn't attractive. What kind of woman are you, Mrs. Le Guennec? DO you sleep well at night? OK? Do you dream? Do you think these girls have sweet dreams? Your husband was a fucking pervert. These women are happy he's dead. It was OK while no one knew, but Nathalie Alami's husband set fire to the farm. And Nathalie... You know Nathalie. You were afraid of scandal, of secrets being known. - I thought... - You thought what? You thought nothing, you knew. They're 21! I thought he'd stop. I didn't know. She knew it all. - It's my investigation! - What's up? Leave me alone! What's your goddamn problem? - We need to talk! - They called you about Kilian. - What's wrong with her? - Nothing. What's going on? Did you know Marie was assaulted when she was 14? What does "assaulted" mean? Marie was raped. She was raped by Mathieu Le Guennec. What? I even think she killed him. I'm afraid she might do something stupid. Where is she? Marie, where are you? Marie! Shit! Marie! What the hell is wrong? Why didn't you tell me? What was I supposed to say? I saw him in the paper and it all reemerged. I wanted him to confess. So I went to see him. Before him, I became a little girl paralyzed by fear. Had you told me, we would have locked him up. I wanted him to admit what he did. - He wouldn't, so... - You killed him. But he messed up half of my life. Le Guennec's wife knew it all. - She'll pay. - Can you hear yourself? So you'll whack her too? All the evidence is against you, Marie. She didn't kill him, you did. You did! - It's over. - No! No, I can't. I can't go to prison. There's the baby. Don't touch me! You don't get it. Arrest me or get out. OK. - Major... - Delorme! - Sit down! - I'd rather stand. Why didn't you say you knew the victim? Because I wanted to be part of the investigation. You knew the man? He raped you? Yes. When I was 14. So everything Eric said is true? You're not his accomplice. Accomplice of what? - He admitted he killed Le Guennec. - What? All along he knew you were abused. When you read the article, he knew. He followed you when you visited him. He talked to him. He wanted to bring him in. Le Guennec ran away. You know the rest. I went to see him. I wanted him to admit his crimes. I killed him. He told me you'd do this. Go home. - I beg you. - Go home. - It's me! - Right away! - Let me talk to him. - I can't. He's trying to protect me. I know. Why did you accuse yourself? I don't want my son to be born in jail. That's understandable. Do you think Marie will accept it? When will you understand you have to talk, or else things blow up? Anyway, there's no evidence against her. Oh, shit, she had a witness! Jourdain... I talked to Marie. - Is Marie there? - Yes. You want to talk to her? Hang up. Hang up. - You hurt me! - Hurry up. We have no time. Where are we going? Where? Here. Here. Do you remember? It was here. Where were you hiding? There? - I don't want to. - Please. You have to remember. It's important. I beg you. Please. I... I came this way. And I went that way. He was there. Come on! Please. I didn't think you'd come. Will you admit what you did? Always. Still as lovely. Look at me! Do you remember? Not even a... I'm sorry. This tree. He caught me here. He caught me. You're still that naive? He choked you. Yes. That's it. Good, good. He strangled me, made me fall, and we fought. I hit him and killed him. - No! - Yes, it's me. I'll confess something, I always loved to smell fear. With this! Marie! Stop! Stop! Look at me. You'll feel something else now. It was you. You killed him. I remember. But it's not her fault. - He was going to kill her. - Leave this. I'm here. Romain, eh... I don't want you to go right away. I want to talk to you. For real. I want to listen to you, this time. Well, I know I... I'm not perfect. My head's always in the clouds, but I'm like that. We're not alike, you and me. You could help me keep my feet on the ground. Right? Would you stop saying "Merlin, korrigan, elves, Arthur" at the end of every sentence? I promise. If I'm lucky I will get probation. We'll need a good lawyer. It will be all right. We need to be strong. For him, for us. - For us. - Yes. I love you. Me too. Come on. I'm here. I won't move.
