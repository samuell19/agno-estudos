Help him with the lessons. Okay? Young man, go sit there. A new student! Hey, you. Can you play football? If you can play, you can sit here. If not, you can't. Don't listen to his nonsense. Don't stare at me like that. Leave him alone. (In Russian) Hello. (In Russian) Hello. Sit down. Today we have a new student. What's your name? - Do you speak Russian? - Qodrat. He must answer by himself. My name is Sima Petrovna. - What's your name? - Qodratullah. Welcome, Qodratullah. Let's teach Qodrat the Russian alphabet.

(In Hindi-Urdu) I don't know when and where it happened but I kept thinking about it and simply fell in love. I don't know when and where it happened but I kept thinking about it and simply fell in love. All the streets have turned into gardens. All the buds have blossomed into flowers. All the streets have turned into gardens. All the buds have blossomed into flowers. It looks like my wedding costume is ready. But I kept thinking about it and simply fell in love. I stay quiet and don't say anything. There's nothing left to say. I stay quiet and don't say anything. There's nothing left to say. I don't know when and where it happened but I kept thinking about it and simply fell in love. Wake up, boys. Move your mattresses out into the sun. Wake up. You are still sleeping. Why are you on the floor? You, boy. Why do you sleep on the floor? - Are you afraid of sleeping in a bed? - No, sir! Ehsanullah. The room captain can't sleep that late. Bring your mattresses out into the sun. Hurry up. Attention! Wares, son of Nader, come to the courtyard, you have a visitor. Attention! Wares, son of Nader, come to the courtyard, you have a visitor. - Down there is a garden full of flowers. - What do you mean? There are so many women down there, you can't help but drool. I'm not interested. You should look. Just once. You're such a bastard. Hey you, boy, what are you looking at? What are you looking at? Fuck off! Look at their dresses. If they weren't so frustrated they wouldn't dress like that. Look at the boobies. Their collars are wide open. I wish they were 10 cm wider. Imagine if they were. I would die. And even then I'd still like to see more. If you were the tailor, you could make their collars wider. If I had a wife, I'd make her a dress like that - - so I could look at her all day long. What a luxury! I'm so depressed here. I wish I could somehow get out of here. Where to? What are you talking about? Anywhere. I hate this country. - Where do you want to go? - Abroad, where I can be free. Downstairs is just like abroad. Just look at the flowers. Forget the flowers! Then let's go together. We'll go directly to a whorehouse the moment we get there. I'll walk in and say: Hurry up, bring me a girl! When you have enough money you can even open your own whorehouse. Put your picture on the signboard and write "Asad's Whorehouse". I'm telling you, leave this country and... Boss! Boss. I saw Wares going to his room... Talk slowly, you idiot! I saw Wares going to his room with two full bags. - Which room? - His own. Okay. Go now. Fuck off. - Let's go. - Yeah, let's go. No use sitting here, except to masturbate. God protects you, ladies! - What's going on? - None of your business! - Which one of you is Wares? - Why? - None of your business. Who is Wares? - That boy, there. - Him? - Yeah! - Are you Wares? - Yes. - Look at the water boiler. - Water boilers aren't allowed here. - Do you want to burn down the dorm? - How did you get it in? - What did you do with the bags? - Which bags? - The two bags you brought to your room. - I didn't. Are we blind? Don't lie when we're being nice to you. Go get the bags. Give it to me. What's inside? Empty it. Look at the dry fruit. - Where is the other bag? - There was only one. - There is a second one. - No. It is just some clothes. - Get it! - Don't bother him. Did I ask for your opinion? Mind your own business. Are you Wares or what? - Get the other bag. - Move your ass. Give it to me. What is this then? What a cool T-shirt. This is a large size, too big for you. Give it to me. It's my size. We have no cups, and he has a water boiler. Next time, tell your visitor to give you money. Look at Rambo. I look exactly like him. Put that somewhere. Get up. Don't cry. Don't worry about it anymore. Hey, guys! Qodrat! A tank has crashed! - Don't make up stories. - I'm not. Look for yourselves! I'm almost ready. Hurry up. He is dead. Run, run! (In Russian) Get out of here! (In Russian) Get out of here! Anton! Sergei! I wonder how the tank fell down. Did you see inside? It was full of blood. (In Russian) Hello? We need help. (In Russian) Centre, we need help. Look, he's totally loosing it. They are coming. - They're coming to help. - Of course, they can't leave them here. Guys? What is this for? - Maybe to shoot. - Automatic shooting. - Check if there are more. - There are many. - Bullets? - Let me see. This one is already used. - Wow, so many bullets. - It's cool. It's bloody. Qodrat? How do I look? It fits you well. Keep it on. - Bullets. - Really cool. You can make nice keyrings out of them. - What kind of keyrings? - How? How can you make keyrings with bullets? - I can. - That's nonsense. - They'll make great keyrings. - How do you make them? Even if you can, who would buy them? Anyhow, I'm sure you can't do anything with them. - What do you mean? Of course I can. - What would you do with them? What do you think? I'll sell them for 100 rupees. Who would pay 100 for a keyring? If people pay 100 for those, what would they pay for this big one? - They won't be interested, it's too big. - That's not true. Why attach small keys to a huge keyring? Then I'll make a necklace. This idiot wants to make a keyring with this big bullet! I said a necklace. - Who's going to put that around his neck? - Me! Nobody would buy that, not even for one rupee. - I'll make it for myself. - People will make fun of you. - Why? - They'll think you're crazy! No, they will say: "Look how beautiful his necklace is." - Did you unlock it? - Yes, let's go! Sit closer! Let me teach you how to properly steal apples. Let me find some good ones. The gardener here has a bad temper. If he catches us, we're done. - There is a gardener? - Yes, and he is violent. Pick them up, Qodrat. There are crazy people right next to the orphanage. What are they doing there? They keep them in the blocks over there. Those blocks? One of my cousins is also there. - How old is he? - Same age as us. - Is he crazy? - Yes. Poor guy. Let's make a list of the teachers we are in love with. Teacher Nilufar, teacher Sima, comrade Farida. Let's call her Mrs. Deputy, that's more respectful. Yeah, let's concentrate on her. Mrs. Deputy walks around like a queen. - She said: "Do you think I'm blind?" - Be quiet. They are asleep. I wanted to answer: "You have beautiful eyes. Let God never make them blind!" - But Teacher Nilufar is special. - Hey, don't talk about her anymore! He can't sleep at nights because he dreams of her! At night, when Masih is asleep, if he hears Nilufar's name - - he jumps out of his bed. Oh god, I'd die for Nilufar! She has a funny way of laughing. Like this... She is pretty, but she has a mole by her lips. I am dying for her mole. - What did you say, Hasib? - I said the whole point is that mole. Right, Qodrat? (In Russian) Dear passengers, welcome to the capital of the Soviet Union, Moscow. Our plane has landed in Sheremetyevo-2 Airport. Local time is 6.12 pm. (In Russian) Here is our bus. Let's go over there. (In Russian) Thank you! Dear children, I am the director of this Pioneer camp. Welcome to the Pioneer Camp, and to the great USSR. I'm happy to welcome you here and I can assure you - - that you will have a wonderful time here learning the values of our great country. Today, you have all arrived here, so get comfortable and make new friends. Tomorrow the official program begins: We will have a meeting devoted to the memory of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Then you will have a chance to honor the memory of our great country's creator. (In Russian) Come on in. You can sit over there. Qodrat, take a seat. Qodrat, do you want to try? I have no idea how it works. What do you know? Let me play. - It doesn't work. - A real chess game is much better. See if any chess tables are free. Look! It works. You're just bluffing. You only know real chess, you can't play with this. Look. If you can't play, just leave. You leave. Look. I can play. I got the trick. He is just bluffing, let's play somewhere else. If Ehsanullah was here, he would have loved this place. - Can he play? - Yes, he has played for ages. He used to send challenge letters to other people. Hasib, look! Who is the winner now? Bravo! Let's all congratulate Masihullah. He came from Afghanistan - - and he just beat the computer! (In Russian) Thank you! Thank you! Bravo! Well done! - Hello, sir! - How are you, Masih? - Did you have a good time? - Yes. Where is Qodrat? - How are you? - I'm fine, sir. - How about you, Hasib? - Yes, it was good. Masih, come with me. - You had a good time there? - Yes, it was great. - Listen Masih, I need to talk to you. - Why? - It's about your nephew, Fayaz. - What happened to him? I will explain. He got a bit sick. Fayaz! Fayaz! Fayaz! Fayaz! Fayaz! He has a fever. Maybe he got an injection. - Why has this happened to him? - I have no idea. - He is not waking up. - They've given him something. Fayaz! Fayaz! Don't play the tough guy with me! If I slap you, you won't recover from it. I didn't take your money. You are not a kid. Listen to what I'm asking. But I didn't steal from you. - If I learn the truth... - Then come and talk to me. Who do you think you are? Are you stupid? "Come and talk to me!" I didn't take your money! Stop repeating yourself. Just give me the money! Good afternoon, sir. - Hello, sir. - What happened? - I lost 500 rupees. - Don't move, kids! - You said? - I had 500 rupees under my pillow. When I came back to the room, it wasn't there anymore. - Where did you get the money from? - My father gave it to me. Your father? In your profile it says you have no parents. - I found it. - Where? Where in the orphanage did you find money? - On my way. - What way? On my way to the hallway. Hallway? Except for me, no one has 500 rupees here. Since I did not lose any, tell me the truth! Where did you get it? I often see you with the security guards. You, come here! - I'm not hanging out with them. - Then I am lying? Maybe you saw someone else and thought it was me. - Why are you always following him? - I'm not. What were you doing with the guards at the gate? I was not with him, sir. He chose the wrong path. Do you want to be like him? - Absolutely not, sir. - Step aside. I've also received complaints from the school. You don't go to manual crafts, and you skip the queues before meals. - Who complained? - Just go! I know what kind of boy you are! Go! - Go! I'll talk to the others. - What did I do, sir? Go, just go. I told you many times to come and tell me when the older boys harass you. Next time, sir. - How are you, Masih? - Much better. - Better since this morning? - Yeah, better. It's good that you feel better. - The Russian teacher left the school. - Really? I'm not joking! Did she leave, or did they kick her out? No idea! She said goodbye to everyone. I wish I could have said goodbye to her. It doesn't matter. You were sick. No Russian class anymore. Maybe the Soviets will send another teacher. - Hi. - Come in. - Ehsan sends you this challenge letter. - Ehsan? - I'll leave. - Okay! Listen! "Challenge, challenge, challenge..." "I, Ehsanullah, son of Mohammad Sharif - - challenge you, Masihullah, son of Habib Rahman, to a chess game." "We will play in front of everyone - - and you will lose. Respectfully, Ehsanullah." And then he signed with his thumbprint right here. Hurry up, move. - What's he doing? - No idea. - Put it back. - Move it so you can save it. And you beat a computer in the USSR? Maybe it was a fake computer. He is regretting that he accepted the challenge. No one can defeat me. You, kiddo, thought you could beat me. Use your tricks in the USSR. Here is Afghanistan. Okay? Check. Check. Game over. You lost. You beat me? Me? What's going on here? What's this mess? Hey, you! I'm talking to you! Stop it. Boys! You stay here! What's going on? - Why do you always point me out? - Because you are the leader! - It's not me. - Get out. - Don't touch me. - How dare you? - You want me to beat you? - Don't touch me. - I will beat you. - Yeah, beat me. You should be ashamed of yourself. - Don't touch me! - Get out! Well, Ehsan. - You are leaving. - Doesn't matter. - Goodbye, my friend. - If you need me, I will be here. Goodbye. - He's been upstairs for ages. - Why do you care? You'll be the goalkeeper, waiting for the ball. - I don't want to be the goalkeeper. - Of course you do. - Let's go! - Where's the ball? - Feraidoon is bringing it. - Who? - Why is he coming? - He didn't want to lend us his ball. - But he's no good. - That's how it is. How are you, Feraidoon? You're destroying it. Then you can't use it. Then I'll take another one, we have plenty. It's difficult. - I told you from the beginning. - I have to drill into it. Where is the nail? - Let's go to dinner. - I'll come in a minute. - Hi. How are you guys? - Good! How about you? - You were so mean, my friend. - I was so angry at Hasib. - I had to take the ball from him. - You always do that. He made me... What was that? - Hasib! - Who is inside? Open the door! Stand back! Oh, my God! What a disaster! Everyone downstairs! Move! Hurry up! Go down! (In Hindi-Urdu) I will treasure our friendship until my last breath. I would rather die than leave you. I will treasure our friendship until my last breath. I would rather die than leave you. People see us as two people but look, we are not two. To drift apart or to quarrel let's pray it won't happen. We'll eat together. We'll drink together. We'll live and die together during all our life. I will treasure our friendship until our last breath. Together with Fayaz... Remember the time when we played football, poor Fayaz fell down. He was badly injured and thought we had done it on purpose. We had such a good time back then. The other boy and Fayaz were the two worst players. Once while swimming, we pushed him into the water and he got mad at us. With all his clothes on... He was so angry, he didn't talk to us for a week. Fayaz was like that... Sit down, boys! Sit down! Listen carefully. Mr. Director needs to speak to you. Boys, there are some changes in the country. Comrade Najib is not the president anymore. At the moment, he is trapped in the UN office in Kabul. The government is still in power. Don't panic - - but it's possible that the Mujahideen will take over Kabul at any moment. For your safety - - you should collect all documents relating to the government and the USSR - - and gather them in the backyard. We'll take care of them. Don't be afraid, finish your dinner. - I'm here with you. - Did you understand? - Yes, sir! - Good. - What did he say? - No idea. You boy, take this outside! Take this and also this one. Hurry up! Faster. Faster. Move, move. What are you doing? Go, go. Hurry up, boy. Take them out! Take those books. What are you doing? You two go upstairs and you help him. Go over there. Didn't you eat enough? Hurry up! Take that. Grab those.

In the name of God! With the permission of... Mrs. Deputy? May I take the absence book? - Which class do you belong to? - The one next to the office. Hello, Mr. Teacher. Hello. - What an awful meal. - Disgusting! Look, a fly. I also found one yesterday. I don't know what kind of person this cook is. Each time we find insects, we lose our appetites. Then it is better to only eat bread. - Sir, you can sit here. - It's fine. Boys, get up. Go to the dorm, now! Everyone! Hurry up! Hurry up! Go! Move! Faster, go inside! Faster, go inside!
