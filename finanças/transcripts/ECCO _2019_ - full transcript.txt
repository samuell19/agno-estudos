Mid 11 figures, if our lab can deliver on time, which we'll see. Are they selling them for parts? You know me. I wouldn't allow it. Do they know who they're selling them to? We did -some trials there. -Do any of you actually know why we tested our products? It's time. Right now. This is his vision -for global security. -There are still ethical issues. Stella, why isn't he here? You know why. We all know where he stands, so to speak. Remember what he inherited. Right? He turned this all around from a R&D death spiral, into our mighty God... ...prophet. I still find him to be a God damned magician. We owe him this. Our savior, his swan song to the highest bidder.

[man in chair] You're wrong, more than you know. There is more of my life in you than you can comprehend. What are you talking about? [man in chair] The pain you feel is nothing compared to what I've endured. The toll you have had on my life... ...all of you. [panting] Go fuck yourself.

[intense punching and grunting] [screaming] [bones cracking] [yelling and panting] Is this what you want? [man in chair] Yes. Every time one of them dies, you are reborn. Don't you see? You are worth more to me now. You are only alive because of me. Never forget that. [groaning] [man in chair] This is who you are. This is what you will always be. [eerie music] [eerie music intensifies] [doors clanking] [light buzzing] [suspenseful music] [man] My dear Michael, this is a letter of caution. No man remembers being born, being brought into the light, but I was there with you when your eyes opened for your first cries. I knew you were the one, my only achievement. I knew you were going to be of consequence to this world, capable of doing things no other man could, capable of anything. But hear me now. Use your gifts for good. Remember, my boy, you are the ripple of my creation. Never forget where you came from, who you really are. Never forget that I am your father, and you are my only son.

[man in chair] From your beginning... ...you did what I could not. No. [gunshots] [siren blaring] [man in chair] How careless you were with her life. Why did you kill her? [man in chair] No, my dear boy, you killed her. Had you done what I asked, she would be alive. She knew nothing! [man in chair] She knew your face, your body, your touch... ...and she knew your real name. She was innocent. [man in chair] She was, until she met you. Every day, you killed her. Again, and again, and again. -Shut up! -And again, -and again. -Shut up. Shut the fuck up! [panting] [man in chair] Your rage is bleeding with truth. Don't you see? You failed her as you failed me. You betrayed us all. I did. I... I killed her. It was my fault. [somber music] [man in chair] And all of these. I killed them. [breathes heavily] I killed them all. [man in chair] You are not a lover, nor a husband, a father, or a son. You are nothing to this world, but everything to me. Why am I alive? [man in chair] I needed you. You were always my favorite, Michael. Don't you remember? I can show you who you really are. Do I have a choice? [man in chair] You can die tonight, a forgotten domino like the rest of the world, or I can let you live. I wanna live. Please. Please, I do. [man in chair] In my shadow? Working for me? Yes. [man in chair] Your blind loyalty? Yes. [man in chair] I can't hear you, Michael. Yes. [man in chair] Your forgiveness? You have it. [man in chair] You see, you are a killer, Michael. An animal born in a cage. And your freedom is this final target. Someday you will thank me for this gift of anonymity. [airplane engine rumbling] [eerie music] Can I help you? Where we going? Not far. Tonight? No flight plan. No flight plan? [laughing] [eerie music] [faint and overlapping voices] [helicopter blades whirring] [cell phone buzzing] Hey, you. You there? [Abigail] Yeah.

What's down there? I need 20 minutes. At 30... ...I leave you. I'll be dead, anyway. [cell phone buzzing] [dark music] [dark music continues] [camera clicks] Look at me. [silencer shooting] [dark music intensifies] My son. You've changed. A man knows when he is growing old when he looks like his father. I knew you'd find me again. It was worth it... ...waiting for you. After all this time... ...why did you come for me? Because I'm selfish... ...and weak. I had to see you. I betrayed you, Michael. Yesterday. Years ago. Who did this to you? They exiled me, Michael, from my work. I'm a banished king, protected every second. Even from myself. We agreed. We agreed... ...to end this when I paid my debt. It should have ended with you, the first one. The only one that mattered to me. You promised me. You promised me my freedom. No, no, my boy, I promised you anonymity to make you stronger. And, look, you're alive. I turned you into something I never intended. From a man... ...into... ...an animal. Oh, it was my mistake to pretend to be God. I don't care. You were the only one who knew who I was. You still don't understand who you are. Who am I? You came into the world alone. I took you away. What I did I had to do. For the work, I needed you... ...to be. What is you talking about? I am not the father you deserve. I made you... ...but I am not him. But I was your only family. Not anymore. What are you saying? I have a family of my own. Impossible. I am not the animal you think I am. A wife? Tell me her name. Abigail. Abigail... ...like the raging wind. We can end this together. What do I need to do? Step out of the shadows you have worked so hard to shroud yourself within. You run. Stay alive. There is nothing there -for you. -Help me. Help me, damn you. In your beginning... ...is your end, Michael. No man remembers... ...the day he was born, but his father does. You were born... ...October 3rd... ...1973. Where? Where I took you so many years ago... ...before you were taken from me. Seek yourself... ...in the darkness. Who am I? I tried to love you. Forgive me, my boy. Once more... ...unto the bridge... ...and after... ...kill them all. And ghosts will die, and you, you will live in the light... ...once more. Unto the bridge once... ...once... ...once, more. Once more unto the bridge. [gunshot] [somber music] [camera clicks] [Aubrey] Look at me. Look at me. [camera clicks] Yeah. Now just, just slowly unbutton that shirt.

You killed all of them like you've done that before. Who are you? Tell me the truth... ...or there is no us. Just let me in. [father] Where I took you so many years ago. [Michael] He's gone. I killed him a long time ago. He's not supposed to exist anymore. [Abigail] This baby needs his father, which is you. They are gonna kill you. [Michael] We have to make sure they'll never find us. [Abigail] Come back to me. [father] It was my mistake... ...to pretend to be God. [Michael] Who am I?

[eerie music] Our father was no God. He was a broken man... ...a stupid, blind man. You were special. He couldn't see it. He was blind to your true worth, your only real value in this world. I saw opportunity in his creation... ...profit in your profession. [panting] So I took him apart... ...piece by piece, His company, share by share. Killed his dream, life by life. Look around. Do you see? Do you see? In the vessel of his creation... ...the whore... ...that bore his only bastard. My first kill was long before yours. [gunshot echoing] [panting] [crying] You... ...you God damned coward. He knew who you were. He knew nothing about me! You're wrong. He knew... [panting] ...what you would become. And he... ...he wished... ...you didn't exist. He asked me... ...begged me... ...his only... ...son... ...for one last job. The promise of my freedom... ...the... ...price... ...to be forgotten. You know what that was? You. You liar. But I... ...I couldn't take my own life... ...even yours. [groaning] And... ...I paid for it. You found me... ...but remember? I let you. I... ...let you... ...live. Oh. And for he that outlives this day and comes safe home shall be my brother. No, you... ...you are nothing to me. And you... ...were never real... ...just the echoing dream... ...of a delusional man. But thank you for killing him. Thank you. I planned his death the moment I knew his weakness. You. And now... ...you become... ...a ghost. [eerie music intensifies] [gunshot] [gasps] [gunshot] [gunshot] [panting] [somber music] [grunting] [panting] [grunting] Put me down. Put me down. Put me down.

[Abigail] He's sleeping. You should be here. What's his name? [breathes heavily] [Abigail] We'll decide together. Come home. I'm on my way. [panting] You... ...look at me. You find her... ...you tell her. Tell her everything. She deserves to know. Do tell her, tell her... [panting and stuttering] ...start from the beginning, but tell her. Show her. He... ...he... ...he can't ever know about me. [breathes heavily] [somber music] [Michael] He can't ever know about me. [man in chair] Open your eyes. Time to find out who you are.
