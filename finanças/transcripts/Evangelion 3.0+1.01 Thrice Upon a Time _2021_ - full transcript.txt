PREVIOUSLY ON EVANGELION EVANGELION:1.11 YOU ARE ALONE. Mankind's ultimate multipurpose humanoid decisive weapon: Artificial human Evangelion. Shinji Ikari, you're the pilot. Launch the Eva. There is no way I could! Stop wasting time. Get in the Eva or get out! Don't run away... Don't run away. Don't run away! I'll be the pilot. Our Eva can defeat an Angel. Our future depends on defeating the Angels. 15 years ago, half of humanity died in the Second Impact. If the Angels set off a Third Impact, humanity will die out. What am I doing here? Don't you have faith in him? In the work he does? Piloting the Eva is all I have, right? It's the only reason Father sent for me. That's why I have to be the pilot. You need to decide if you want to be an Eva pilot. I'll do it! I'll pilot my Eva. You won't die. I will protect you. He didn't run from piloting the Eva. He should be left in charge unless he wants out! - Go get him! - I'm counting on you. Farewell. No, it's just that I don't have anything else. Ayanami! I don't know how I should act at times like this. Smile, that would be good. Children with predestined fates... EVANGELION:2.22 YOU CAN ADVANCE. Asuka Langley-Shikinami. Eva Unit 02's pilot. You're an idiot! Wow, I guess some people like being an Eva pilot. So, you have issues with your father? - Good work, Shinji! - He congratulated me for the first time. This Human Instrumentality Project... What's NERV really up to? Protect Katsuragi for me. I feel warm and fuzzy when I'm with Shinji. You're in love, that's what it means! Makes you pretty interesting. You can be happy without one. Father, Asuka's inside that Eva! That is an Angel! Our enemy! Arghh! - It's all Father's fault! - Running away again? What's wrong with running away from pain? I never want to pilot an Eva again. Fretting over stuff like that makes the life less fun. Just to make sure that Shinji won't have to pilot an Eva anymore! I'm here because I'm Shinji Ikari, pilot of Evangelion Unit 1! Give me back Ayanami! Do it to make your wish come true! Even if I'm gone, others can replace me. Ayanami! Come here! I'm sorry. In the end, I couldn't do anything. No need to be sorry. It's fine. It's the continuation of the Second Impact. The Third Impact is beginning! - The world is ending. - The time has come. EVANGELION:3.33 YOU CAN REDO. Shinji Ikari, don't do anything. Shouldn't I be piloting Unit 1? This is crazy, Misato! How am I supposed to take this in all of a sudden? Because 14 years have passed since then. We're WILLE, an organization dedicated to the destruction of NERV! I'm Kaworu Nagisa. I'm like you, another child with predetermined fate. Evangelion Unit 13. When the time comes, you are to pilot the Eva with him. Don't pilot an Eva ever. - Rei doesn't exist anymore. - You're lying! Once awakened, Eva Unit 1 opened the Doors of Guf, and acted as the trigger to bring about the Third Impact. You were the key to all of this. - You're the one I saved, right? - I don't know. Let's begin, Fuyutsuki! Idiot Shinji, do you want to start another Third Impact? I'll take those spears for you. For everyone! And then the world will turn to normal! And even Misato will have to... Misato, activate the DSS choker! - Don't do this, Shinji! - Stop it, you stupid brat! What the hell is this? The Fourth Impact. This is its opening rite. Is it my fault? Because I pulled out the spears? These were my orders. Don't look so sad. We'll meet again, Shinji. Kaworu! Nothing good ever happens! You're so naive. There are no sins you can't atoned for. There is hope. There is always hope. ♪ While living in this world ♪ ♪ Is like a long trek on a hill ♪ ♪ What's important is not about ♪ ♪ How long you live ♪ ♪ As long as you didn't stray ♪ ♪ Off the path of truth ♪ Paris Assault Fleet, fully operational. Descending at Point Zero of the former city. All stations, assume defensive posture. Dead slow astern. Gravity control, autonomous movement, remote control, all nominal.

Analysing atmosphere's composition. Oxygen density minus 3. Carbon dioxide within allowable tolerances. Disembarkment possible. Roger. Start operation. It's been 16 years. To see the renown City of Flower in this state... It pains my heart! The L field density is higher than expected. The restoration work on Euro NERV's Containment Pillar No.1 shall not take more than 720 seconds. What? That's 180 seconds shorter than planned! What about time needed for getting back? I'm more embarrassed about wearing this. They should leave that to the Eva pilots. Shut your mouth, and focus on your work. So, can we get the anti-L system activated? Yes, a redo from Stage 4 should work just fine. All thanks to our predecessors. We will uphold your wishes to preserve this city. Right, let's get to work. They're coming! Just as we expected! Eva 44A, customized aerial type! Incoming from 4 o'clock! Amazing line ahead formation. They've formed a colony all on its own. It's like a new creature now. Mari, please intercept them. Give us another 560 seconds. You betcha! I'll do the honors of handling all those 44As! All right, Nagara, my gal, I'll leave you to handle my wire action! Let's see now... Yaw, roll and pitch... Oh! Whoa! This setup is interesting, but feels a bit awkward. Wished they'd at least kept humanoid points of articulation. Unit 8, currently engaging 1st wave of 44As. 2nd wave detected. As planned, all 44As are being drawn to Unit-08. Available operational duration: 420 seconds. Chief Boatswain, this is slow, its like working on an 8-bit PC. Just like with the Evas, it's an enigmatic system that humanity still does not fully understand. Control via human language isn't easy. Stage 4: completed. We're lagging behind quite a bit. Keep calm and hurry it up. - Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am! Argh! Yee-haw! Maintain speed. Plus 20 on guide rig. Keep current pitch. Steady as she goes! You're not getting away! Yah! The 4th wave, huh? One against many. Many a small bird drive away a hawk, eh? Operational time remaining: 360 seconds. This is impossible! I can't find a way to skip to Stage 5. Anything can be done! Keep going deeper! It's impossible! Not enough time to overwrite the data! Nothing is impossible! Add more bypasses! Chief, there's not enough time! Stop your whining! This is why I hate young men. Scurry off, you bums! Get out of here! Now that was a piece of cake! So the mock angels were using decoys, huh? Cocky little punks! Heads up: Boss Enemy! An example of a military application of Evas. A clear violation of the Vatican Treaty! What a combo to be up against! A positron cannon armed 4444C land-battle variant and power supply customized 44Bs. Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki must be testing us. High energy readings from the 44Bs are increasing! All stations: ready defensive measures! All hands: brace for impact and EM blast. 4444C is now in firing position. The 44Bs are generating a massive power surge. Their energy is being routed to the ultra-high voltage system! All power supply systems of 4444C now active. Positron acceleration now in its final phase! Its breech is now closed and locked! Shout imminent! Just made it in the nick of time! If it shoots again, we'll be hosed. High energy readings from the 44Bs once more. It's storing energy into the high-power emission system. Already? 4444C, acceleration initiated. Assuming firing position! We're really screwed! Second shot imminent! This is really, really bad! Nagara, gal, give me a diversion! Roger. Haaaaa-yaaa! That won't stop me! Excusez-moi, Eiffel! The 4444C is now completely silent. Operational time left: 30 seconds! - Using C for analysis. - The final security lock is now disabled. Anti-L System, Stage 5 is now complete! It's activating now, XO! Restoring the old Paris. All Euro NERV facilities in hibernation are now rebooting. Systems coming back on line. Very good work, Maya! That was a really close call back there. Assault successful. Misato, please come collect the luggage. Roger. Now descending to the resupply point. All hands: ready resupply. Priority One on recovery of Eva spare parts and munitions. Lower all logistics support ships. Aircraft carriers go first. Hurry! Gather together all the parts needed to build a new Unit 2! The end crowns the work. Now a cannibalized Unit 2 can be built anew. Mari and Unit 8 can be modified to be overlapping-compliant. No matter where you are, I'll come get you, doggy! EVANGELION:3.0+1.01 THRICE UPON A TIME Tsk! What a weakling! Sorry, I'm late. Are you OK, Ikari? Hey, dogs aren't allowed in there! Oh, wow! Hey, there! You're awake! Recognize me? It's me, boss! Tohji Suzuhara. It's really been a while, Shinji. I was blown away by the way you looked when they brought you in here. I know a little bit about what happened to you, but it's all so strange it's over my head. I'm glad you're doing OK. So, can you get up now? Well, it looks like it. Good! Let's get you up and back to my place. Here. It's a bit chilly out there. Doctor, the girl doesn't want to change her clothes. It's fine. Let her be. And sir, we're about to run out of Tamiflu. All right, I'll talk to rations manager. I'm sorry, but I'm going to call it a day. All right, let's go. This place is strange. So many people are here! Is this the first time you've seen crowds? This is Village 3, an enclave that houses survivors from different places. About 1000 people live here. That's where food is rationed out, three times a week. Different stuff on different days. Hello, Doctor! Oh, Ms. Matsukata! You're expecting. Please, don't exert yourself. Sir, are these the two Kredit sent to you that you're looking after? Yeah, it's something like that. - Take care of yourself, won't you? - Right! I'll be off then. OK, bye! What is "Kredit"? Kredit is a welfare support organization created by WILLE. It not only provides goods, but they also act as a go-between for trade between other villages. Our village here... It's a far cry from being self-sufficient! What is that? It's shaped differently from dogs. Uh, that's a cat. "Cat"? First time seeing a cat as well? They've made the underside of the carriage their den. There's about ten of them living there. SUZUHARA RING IN CASE OF MEDICAL EMERGENCY This is my old but happy home. We have the privilege of living in a house of our own. I'm home! I'll get started on getting dinner ready. Hey there, dinner is finally served. Eat it while it's hot! Shinji, you must be starving. You gotta get some food in yourself! Oh, well. Come around when you feel like getting some chow. You can come whenever you want. OK, so let's eat! What do you think? Isn't it tasty? It feels strange in my mouth. It's so warm and soft. That's right. It's delicious. See? My daughter knows how prepare to a meal so it's just right! She's the best wife in the world. You'll be surprised when you see her. We're home. Sorry we're late. Oh, hey. Welcome home. We've been waiting. Shinji, take a look. Can you tell who my wife is? It's the Class Rep! I couldn't believe my ears! It still feels like a dream to see you. It's been so long, Shinji and Ms. Ayanami. No, I'm not Ayanami. What's that? You're not? Then... She's a look-alike! What is this? That's my daughter, Tsubame! Isn't she cute? It's a human, but small. Why did you shrink her? Are you telling me you've never seen a baby either? She was even smaller when she was born. Babies grow up really fast. This is "cute". You betcha! Isn't she the cutest? She's my daughter, after all! Oh dear. I'm sorry. Loud voices startled you, didn't they? I'm sorry, Tsubame. I guess I made you cry. Huh? Hey, the big guy's here! Sorry I'm late. Look what I've got. What are you doing? Babies grow up by drinking their mom's milk. I'm sorry, Ms. Look-alike, you can't. Not yet. I don't know. What would Rei Ayanami do at a time like this? You're different from Ms. Ayanami, right? So you should do what you think you should do. I can be "different"? ♪ Get over it! Don't talk about life! ♪ Hey, Ikari. It's been a while. It's me, Aida. Kensuke Aida. ♪ Yeah! ♪ Kensuke, he's the one that saved you. I can't count all the times this survivalist geek came to our rescue. If it wasn't for him, we'd all have starved to death a long time ago. Shinji, it's fine to be quiet, but the least you can do is eat food that's been served to you. Please, Mr. Horaki, I shouldn't have forced him to come here and eat with us. Let's let him be on his own for today. But Tohji, he's been offered a treat with this meal. Very rude not to even have a bite! Well, Shinji? What of it? Father, you'll wake up Tsubame! Let's take care of the dishes and get the futons out. Tohji, can you get two more for Shinji and Ms. Look-alike? Listen, I think Ikari should come with me. It'll be better that way. Kind of unexpected! Tohji and the Class Rep getting hitched. They were at each other's throats all throughout junior high school. It all changed with the Near Third Impact. All the troubles that followed brought them closer together. See, Ikari? Some good came out of that close call. We'll get there in no time once we reach the top, Ikari. Here we are! This place used to be an unmanned station. Now it's my self-built home. Make yourself at home. The toilet is at the back of that car. I've got to grab some fuel, so go ahead. I'm naked. Why aren't you getting all hot and flustered? Jeez, you're weird! Ken-Ken, why did you drag in this annoying jerk? I'm home! Yeah, she was here ahead of you. She'll probably be here for a while. Shikinami won't go to the village. It's complicated. No, it isn't. I just don't want to hang around Lilin. They're annoying! So the one thing that will get your attention is the DSS choker? Ken-Ken, you're being too easy on him. Let him clean up his own stupid mess. Ikari can't do anything and he can't eat anything. Something really traumatic must have happened. He's just being his usual self. He shuts himself off from the world and avoids other people. That's what he does all the time. Leave him alone. It's like he doesn't want to live, but he doesn't want to die either. Ikari, you're fine as you are now. Something brought us together. Feel free to ask for help. We're friends, right? I'm just glad you're still alive, Ikari. Hey, Rations Manager, don't get worked up over all this. Thanks for your hard work. Goodnight, dear. Why do you say goodnight? Well, it's something we say hoping we'll all sleep soundly that night. Goodnight, Ms. Look-alike. I'm bored of pretending to sleep. I won't when I finally get some shut-eye. Good morning! Why do you say good morning? Well, it's something we say hoping we can live together for today. Good morning, Ms. Look-alike. Rain or shine, Ken-Ken always gets up at 6. He's already gone to work. There's your breakfast. Just eat already. Well, that's some tight-fitting clothes you're wearing there! This is Ms. Look-alike. The doctor's wife asked us to watch over her for today. Ms. Look-alike? Sounds like she's got some skeletons in her closet. It's OK to have her join us? If she can work, why not? If I can work? I will work if I'm ordered to. This isn't an order. This is working. Can you tell me what is work? Good question! Never thought about it. Well, it's about shedding sweat together, I suppose. Shedding sweat? Use three fingers lightly. Good. Push it down straight and deep. Don't squeeze it. Just let them rest on your fingers. You'll just have to get used to doing it, I suppose. C'mon, slow poke! Keep pace with us. Try to catch up. OK. This is "shedding sweat"? So this is work? Oh dear! The seedlings we planted! Good heavens! C'mon, give us your hand. Good job! We managed to meet our daily target today as well. Here. A special treat for working hard on your first day. What should I say at times like this? Say thank you! Thank you. Right, let's have a nice bath now. What is a bath? MEMORIAL BATHHOUSE This is a "bath". Dear, you can't bathe like that with your clothes on. Bathing is strange. It makes me feel warm and fuzzy, unlike being in LCL. I'm alive even without orders. Why? Rolling over in the corner, all clammed up. You're just putting on a show to get sympathy. You're in the way with my sweeping. You moron! Oh, it's not Mommy. Welcome home, Ms. Look-alike. Thank you for the hard work. Sorry I'm late. Mommy! Yay! - Have you been a good girl? - Weeee! As always, thank you, Hikari. Not at all. We're here to help each other. - Right, let's go home. - Yeah! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! What is "goodbye", Hikari? It's something we say hoping we can see each other again. Let's play together, Mommy! Come on! OK, OK, let's go now. Why are they holding hands? Well, it's something we do hoping we can get along. I'm sick of this! Hey, you're not the only one that's hurting inside. Puking again? Damn brat! You should be grateful you get fed in the first place! You're still a mock Lilin. You won't last if you don't eat. Just swallow it down! I've been living on water only. Enjoy the taste of crappy food before your body changes and stops growing. Idiot! The only reason you don't do anything is because you're afraid of getting hurt! Since you got all this time to yourself, why don't think about why I tried to punch your face in before? Man, you're so feeble in that head of yours! I'll bet you're wrapped up in thinking about how everything you do turns for the worse, and it's all too late! And you don't want to do anything because you know it's all your fault. Maybe you were just listening to what your father told you to do. But damn it! You shouldn't have piloted any Eva! You're such a wimp! Go sulk all by yourself, loser! I'm home. Hey, where's Ikari? He ran away. I see... Leaving him alone might be the best option. Where did he go? The lakeside ruins, north of here. He chose a former NERV facility? I guess there are ties you just can't cut. What about rations? I forced some down his throat. He should last a while. Thank you, Shikinami. It's nothing. I didn't do it for his sake. I'd never let him die selfishly while he still had his head up his ass. You want to know my name? Yeah, I mean we can't keep on calling you Ms. Look-alike. The doctor mentioned something about how you forgot your own name. So why don't you come up with a new one on your own? I can name myself? LIBRARY Books... Shinji mentioned these... You dropped it, so I'm giving it back. Thank you. Wanna read? "OCHIBI AND THE PORCUPINE" Thank you. I'm alone. Always have been, always will be. That's just how it is, Asuka. Who's there? It's me. Original Batch? I'll unlock the door. They told me Shinji would be here. He's not here right now. He's run away. I see. I'll go look for him then. Let me tell you something. Just like how it is with the Evas. We Eva pilots have inhibitors designed into us so that we don't breech human limits. Those inefficient emotions within you are examples of that. It's just a design scheme based on human cognitive behavior. You Ayanami Series have been adjusted so that you will hold affection toward the Third Boy. The emotions you are feeling right now have been rigged by NERV. I see... It doesn't matter. I'm OK with how I feel. I see. Then you're on your own. The object of your affection is at N109 Tower, inside the ruins of the NERV 2nd Branch. Thank you. If you're going to see him, then take some of those rations with you. He should really be needing them at this point. Why aren't you in the village with the others and working there? What are you? Stupid? This isn't a place I'm supposed to live in. It's a place I protect. Shinji. I learned you should return things someone dropped. I'll come again. About Shinji... Is it OK to leave him alone? Bad things might happen at this rate. Let's leave him be for now. Ikari needs time to himself. But, Kensuke, aren't you being a little insensitive towards him? Worrying about him too much won't help any of us. He'll come back. Just believe in him. I guess so. I hope Shinji gets used to living in the village sometime soon. Shinji, why aren't you going back to the village? Shinji, you also aren't doing anything. Are you protecting the village too? I'm not protecting anything. I destroyed everything! I don't wanna talk to anyone. I don't want anyone to come here! I just wanna be left alone! But why is everyone so kind to me? It's because we like you. Thank you, for talking to me. Let's do something hoping we can get along. Tired of running away? Original Batch turned you around? Did all that wailing about help you get it out of your system? Mhh... Fine then... If you can move around, then make yourself useful and help Ken-Ken. Let's hit the road a little. It will take your mind off things. I'm a handyman that does everything, in return for being exempted from taking part in the core industry of the village, which is farm work. Today, we're going to check the infrastructure at the perimeter and verify the environmental conditions It'll be a busy day. Much of the existing infrastructure has exhausted its service life. Since repairing it is very difficult, we've left it alone. We only pick up sticks that have fallen or prune the lower limbs. We want to take good care of the remaining forests. Life at Village 3 is completely dependent on the water here. Checking the water flow is very important. It's tied directly to the survival of the village. Water is the source of life, after all. I'm going to check on the water source further up. The trek is a bit steep, so stay behind and do some work. Here, help secure some food for us. No, I've never done it. I can't do it! Try first, then talk. Don't sweat it. Our quota is one fish per week. There'll be another time to try. That's WILLE's parting gift. It's a complementarity L-containment field purification process nullifying unit. Village 3 has managed to avoid core-ization thanks to it. It's all thanks to Ms. Misato and her group. We started seeing those things recently. We call them Wanderers. Headless Evas who were buried, suddenly got up and started moving about. We're here to observe them today. Yeah, the containment pillars are keeping them away. I guess those seals are effective against the Wanderers as well. There are things a handyman can't do. If the pillars stop working, we're screwed. As you can see, we're not sure how much time we have left. But we're going to struggle on and live until the very end. Those are pickled plums. We look forward to eating them every year. Life is a continuous cycle of tough times and good times. There's nothing wrong with days that feel like repetition. I think that's how it is. Right now is the youngest you'll ever be. I want to live to the fullest because I have Tsubame with me. She's attached to you more than she is to me. You should live here with us from now on, Ms. Look-alike. My name? Yeah, have you picked one yet? No, not yet. Then, why not have someone decide it for you? Give you a name? Yes, I want you to give me a name. I want to stay here. To do that, I need a name. I want you to give me one. A name for you? But you're not Ayanami. Any name will do. I want to have a name that you give me. Is Original Batch functioning all right? Yes, she was here today. Why do you ask? Nothing... no reason. Then, the big chestnut suddenly turned around and ran away... I see... I can only live inside NERV. So, Shinji, have you gotten used to living here? - Uh-hmm. Yeah, a little. - That's good to hear. This is a village of people from far and near, all strangers to each other before. But somehow things are finally settling down. Was it hard at the beginning? Well, let's see... A lot of stuff happened. It wasn't a world where kids without spines could survive without changing fast. We had to grow up in a hurry and learn to do everything on our own. I did things I'm ashamed of. I did them for the sake of my family, but still... It was a world where you wouldn't play nice if you wanted to survive. I'm not really a doctor or anything prestigious like that. I'm just playing the part of one. I learned on my own in order to figure out how to help others. I only make it by thanks to the instruments and facilities that Kredit provides us with. You should be proud of yourself. You're helping people, Tohji. There are lives you can't save, but I keep on going, I think it's the doctor's role to shoulder the sadness and anger that come along with the losses. I want to follow through or make amends for the things I'm responsible for doing. That's the stuff that goes through my head as I live on like this. Shinji, you've already fought a life's worth for us. From now on, you should stay here and live with us. That's what I think. Thanks for coming along with me this early in the morning. At the time, I never thought my father, who survived the Near Third Impact, would die just like that in an accident. I should have had talks with him, had some drinks, and listened to some of his gripes. Your father's still alive, right? Even if you think it's a waste of time, you should sit down and have a good talk with him. You'll regret it if you don't. We're talking about Gendoh Ikari. It's too tough for him. Still, father and son... The ties will always be there. Ms. Matsukata had a hard time during labor, but she pulled through. Thank heavens she gave birth without a hitch. Her husband was crying with joy. Village Background Announcement Ah, well, you can smile after all! Yes, you're quite cute too. Except you wear the same thing all the time. Why don't you change your clothes for once? Yes. I'll try wearing something different. Say, why not try this next? Oh, yes, it looks great on you! She is cute! I'd love to have you be my daughter-in-law. This is "blushing"? That is so "cute"! This is "embarrassed". Sorry, this suit's a bit hot, but keep it on for a while. I'm the jack-of-all-trades handyman, but I also do liaison with Kredit. The L-containment field is weaker here, so Kredit has an outdoor laboratory set up. There is a staff member that I want you to meet. Mr. Aida! It's been too long, sir. I'm guessing this is your new assistant? Yeah, something like that. I've never met an outsider before. I'm Kaji. Ryoji Kaji. What's your name? So, what did you think? Nice guy, isn't he? Yes, he is. But, his name... Kaji... Yeah, he's Misato and Kaji's son. He'll be 14 soon. He knows nothing about his parents. Ms. Misato wants to keep it that way. She felt that she couldn't be much of a mother to him, so she decided she'll stay away for the rest of her life and instead protect him as the head of WILLE. Um, what happened to Mr. Kaji? He died. Someone had to sacrifice themselves in order to stop the Near Third Impact. Mr. Kaji decided he'd be the one. Ms. Misato let him as well. Ms. Misato regrets how you got stuck with all this baggage on your shoulders. She felt she should've been the one. I think she doesn't want to let you pilot an Eva because of that. Ikari, you're not the only one who's hurting. Ms. Misato is in pain as well. The smell of earth... Mr. Kaji... I've just been told Wunder will come by tomorrow. Your return route is all set up. Here are the records of the village that Ms. Misato asked for. There are photos of the family members of the WILLE crew. And here's a letter to Tohji's younger sister. He asks kindly for your help. Yeah, got it. I'm home! These are "tears"? I'm the one crying? Is this how it feels to be lonely? Good morning, Ms. Look-alike. "Good night. Good morning. Thank you." "Goodbye." Good morning! Good morning. What's up? You're here early. I wanted to see you, Shinji. Take this. Thanks. Thank you. Um, about that name you asked about... There's only one Ayanami. I can't think of another name. Thank you. I'm glad you thought about my name. I'm very grateful for that. But I can't live here. But, I like this place. Ayanami? Now that I know what "like" is, I'm happy. Ayanami, what's wrong? I wanted to harvest the rice. I wanted to hold Tsubame more. I wanted to be with the boy I like... forever. Goodbye. Ayanami! Really? Ms. Look-alike isn't with you? What's wrong? So that's the Wunder, huh? Jeez, it's huge! Those must be the people leaving the ship. Guess the final battle is right around the corner. Hey, stop filming me! I'm sorry, but today, I want to film it all. Fine. Do as you please, then. What are you doing here? Ikari, you can stay behind, you know. Thank you, Kensuke. Please give my thanks to Tohji and the others. Asuka, I'll go with you. OK. Well, these are the rules, so... Sakura... Ms. Sakura Suzuhara? I said don't pilot any more Evas, but you ran away and did just that! You jerk! You absolute jerk! You're such a jerk, Mr. Ikari! What are you? His wife? The status of the escapee has been verified. As of now, I will take over responsibility of BM-03's monitoring and restrainment. Please sign here, Temporary Special Senior Major Langley-Shikinami. No DSS choker? There's no need. He will be safeguarded within the blast containment chamber until the end of the mission. Monitored Target Subject BM-03 has arrived at Chamber 2. Ready detonation systems. So this is considered the most secure method for neutralization since the choker was disabled so easily. MAGI-Copy has record of choker activation. It seems its activation triggered an explosion and death that was witnessed by the other pilot. Even after experiencing that trauma, he still decided to return to the Wunder. Why? Can't say. Frankly, Captain Katsuragi granting him permission to board is more of a mystery to me. The liaison handed me records regarding Village 3 and personal correspondence from Suzuhara. From my big brother? Chamber 2's total enclosure and emergency blast activation system is online. The quarantine procedures for Monitored Target Subject BM-03 is now complete. We won't have any issue dealing with supplementing the work assignments left vacant by the departing crew. Work on New Unit 2 is proceeding smoothly, Sit-rep on work on the main gun turrets and ship's exterior? Replacement of Turret 4 and aft turret is proceeding nominally. Work on Eva in the ships external dock is lagging behind by a total of 3%. Speed is Priority One. We're going to rush through one-fifth of the checklist, got it? Yes, ma'am! N1 Rocket's secondary coupling will restart in 5 minutes. It's one thing to have Major Shikinami rejoin us. But why did that troublemaker come along with her? It's better than leaving him in the wild so NERV can take advantage of him. Unrestricted shoot-to-kill orders have been issued to the crew if he should attempt to pilot an Eva. That's pretty reassuring. That's just talk, no substance. I mean the Captain didn't neutralize him when he last escaped. At this point, my faith in her has hit rock bottom. We're talking about a child. I understand her hesitation. That "child" brought about the Near Third Impact and killed all members of my family except me. It was the consequence of his actions. He didn't intend it. Captain is fully devoted to making atonement for what happened. I agree. Kaji entrusted WILLE with her. I feel I can trust her until the ends of the Earth. You are too soft on her because you're close to her. You just think she can redeem herself, just like how someone's piss could be purified to become drinking water. That's not how this works. No problems detected in tests for connecting JA parts to New Unit 2. Proceed as scheduled with work on the independent coordination systems of the left arm. They've added even more explosives. It looks like they're losing faith in us. I'm back. Welcome back, Your Highness! Great work out there. Jeez, look at this place. What happened to purging? You've hoarded even more books. Books are the aggregate of human intellect. My impossible dream is to read every single book of all history and from every corner of the world. Any progress with doggy? Who cares. Not interested. Ah... So you're not interested in cute boys at all? That child doesn't need a lover. He needs a mother. All loading from logistic support ships has been completed. All logistics officers remaining on support ships should vacate and return to the Wunder immediately. This is where you signed to permit the operational independence of Kredit and removal of all restrictions on the Evas, Captain Katsuragi. The document has been certified with the signatures of the Captain and the XO. Maya, please get started. Roger, Senior XO. You're always here when you want to be alone. Maybe we should have this be the captain's quarters? I suppose it's hard to cut yourself off from Ryoji, isn't it? It's not about Kaji. I can relax here. That's all. Well, this section houses the primary mission of this ship: an ark serving to preserve every single life form. Its mission ensured by an unmanned totally autonomous system that can operate independently for a near-perpetuity. The Wunder's true nature is to be such an ark. For Kaji, the preservation of humanity wasn't very important. He held the highest priority on preserving all the diverse life forms that the Human Instrumentality Project would obliterate. He wanted to evacuate as many seeds of life as possible outside of the Earth. Aiming to realize this plan, he seized this ship from NERV while it was still being built. He felt it was impossible for humanity to stop the Instrumentality Project. But in the end, he was able to stop the Third Impact by sacrificing his life. He killed himself, contradicting himself, and being selfish all at once. Super exasperating jerk! But here we are without him. As such, I am going to use this ship to destroy NERV and thwart their Human Instrumentality Project. So you can get revenge? No, instead of being an ark that preserves life, she will be a combat ship that saves lives. As words spoken by a mother, they carry real legitimacy. I have no right to hold such qualification. The Captain and the XO are on the navigation bridge. NERV HQ has started moving. Accompanied by The Black Moon that is standing erect, it is believed to be moving toward Ground Zero in the former location of the South Pole. The restoration of The Black Moon, a precondition for the Fourth Impact to take place... The resurrection of the Advanced Ayanami series, untainted life forms made with pure souls, free of sexual distinction, which shall become the sacrificial offering to the Vessel of the Adams. And the Human Instrumentality Project, humanity's attempt of self-salvation. All that arrogance leads to this, I see. The Third Boy has returned to WILLE. As Ayanami Number 6 was not properly calibrated, it seems to have lost its form. Did you have your son to suffer the same sense of loss you experienced to teach him something, Ikari? Well, he seems to be psychologically stable. So, Captain Katsuragi, what are you going to do with the boy provisionally named Shinji Ikari? Never meet him again, just like your son? You're sure he doesn't need to have a... You're sure he doesn't need a DSS choker? There is no point in redemption unless there is a will to atone for your sins. Misato, I know under that stoic façade of yours, you are ecstatic about Shinji returning to you. Acting on sentimental emotions only leads to deep trouble. You know that first hand. You don't pull punches, as always. Letting you off the hook leads me to deep trouble. I know that first hand. Hardly anything with this body changes, with the sole exception of my hair. How annoying! Gods, corruption, and desires, they dwell within the fibers of hair. It's an apt representation of the chaotic nature of mankind. It's unequivocal proof that you are a human, Your Highness. The cursed Ground Zero of the Second Impact. All the Vessels of the Adams are ready. The reactivation of the Unit 13 is only a matter of time. The reactivation of the Unit 13 is only a matter of time. Right. Let us start, Fuyutsuki. Take care of the rest. So far, everything is going according to SEELE's scenario. Go on, Shinji! Do this for yourself! Do it to make your wish come true! Captain, I have bad news. NERV HQ has arrived at its final destination. We're detecting signs that the reactivation of Unit 13 has started. So what you're telling me is we are running short on time. Yes, but I have good news. The shutdown signal plug has been built. While at their bare minimum states, both Eva units are ready. Understood. All stations: prepare for launch! Have all current work end in 25 minutes. This ship gets underway in 30 minutes! As usual, you're asking for the impossible. All stations: prepare for launch in battle stations condition 2! We disembark in 25 minutes. All hands: complete tasks within 20 minutes. I repeat. All stations: ready launch in battle station condition 1. Make final adjustments to position the unmanned fleet at its launch position. N1 Rocket propellant injection complete. Switching to internal power. Final status check is a "go". All extravehicular work crew must vacate immediately! You've got a bundle on your arm, don't you, Chief Engineer Takao? Yeah, one for each comrade who died when we rose against NERV. Those were the bandanas you used to indicate you were a rebel, right? Yeah, we want to return the sea and the land back to this color. It's the symbol of our promise. Thank you. This bandana has become Ryoji's memento. Take care of yourself, Katsuragi! Truth be told, I wanted to stay behind with Kaji back then. I'm sure you did. If you weren't expecting, you might have been able to. I need to go to battle stations, so I'll be at sickbay. Mr. Ikari, please don't go anywhere. Use the red button to call me, if you need. I'll be on my way. An extra deep-depth, pressure- resistant, experimental plug suit. Seems it's brand spanking new. I'm sure it's a fresh batch cut from virgin fabric. We're wearing these to our funeral. New Unit 2, JA reactor activated. Power output is stable. Energy circulation initiated. Unit 8 improved coupling with the Dragon Carrier is nominal. No point testing decoupling systems. You're going for the real deal from the very get-go! Extracting temporary cage's final lock bolt. Eva units are currently being positioned for launch. Four-Eyed Crony, let's take a little detour. Roger! Adjusting New Unit 2 and Unit 8 Improved entry plug to insertion position. Who is it? Um, I have no idea. I'll give you a hint. Rooftop and glasses... Big boobs... The parachute girl? Bingo! I should introduce myself. I'm Mari Illustrious-Makinami. Nice to meet you again, WILLE Puppy. Huh, you've changed a bit. I guess you're more grown up. Give me a break! This brat doesn't change so easily. Since this is farewell, I want to ask you something. Did you figure out why I wanted to clobber you? It's because I couldn't make up my mind. When you were inside Unit 3, I didn't help you, and I didn't kill you. I did nothing to, escape responsibility. Well, I see you've matured a little. Since this is farewell, let me tell you something. That boxed lunch you made for me, it was pretty tasty. I think I had a crush on you back then. But I've grown into an adult ahead of you. So long. You've done great. You should be proud of yourself, Shinji Ikari. See ya! Feeling better, Your Highness? Yeah, I'm fine. Both Eva pilots have begun boarding their respective entry plugs. Shinji, you need to find a place to rest that you can call your own. The ties that bind you will show you the way. We'll meet again. You're right, Kaworu. APU power output stable. Main engine threshold achieved. Thrust increasing to 11 million 600 thousand tons. Gyrocompass in operation. Helm and gravity controls: all green. Both Evas secured in launch position. Start entry sequence. Routing power to main guns. No abnormalities in energy flow. Unmanned fleet has been locked into position for launch. Suspend extravehicular work detail. Non-combatants: stand by! All stations are now in battle stations condition 1. Captain, all stations ready for launch. We're now ready to storm NERV HQ. Roger. Captain to crew: In order to irreversibly prevent the Fourth Impact from happening, this ship will now assault NERV HQ currently positioned at the former South Pole Ground Zero. Wunder will execute Operation Yamato, the neutralization of Eva Unit 13, which can trigger the Rites of Doom. We'll bring an end to all this chaos once and for all. Now launch Wunder! Entry sequence complete. Command control has been transferred to the battle bridge. Reaching seed storage units' ejection point. Roger. Sever Wunder's linkage to storage units. Make them switch to independent internal power and control systems. Eject all seed storage units. All units ejected into L5. Autonomous systems functioning nominal. Initiate descent to target. Begin reentry. Roger. Initiating reentry. Monitoring systems are back on line. Proceeding to former South Pole ground zero area. Making contact with L-containment field barrier surface. Navigating L-containment field barrier surface. All systems go. Above the L-containment field, an area that refuses all life born of original sin. Now humanity is advancing through this purified area without being blessed. All thanks to the data Kaji retrieved and the Anti-L systems. Two-zero to dive possible point in the L-containment field. Roger. All stations: ready for dive. Starboard hull 2 hit! Damage unknown! Enemy ship sighted at 3 o'clock! Number 2 ship Erlösung with Opfer Type systems! So she was completed after all. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you're going to have to indulge Ikari with his games a bit more. They must be trying to buy time to prevent the reactivation of Unit 13. That ship could also slay gods. She won't be a pushover. Mano-a-mano sounds just fine. Starboard guns, ready to fire! We'll hold that NERV ship at bay until we get to our diving point. Fire! We've taken multiple hits! Their firepower is much greater! Shit. How can that ship be the same class as ours? We're still incomplete, while that ship was fully finished. Be that as it may, our main engine is much better. We can now dive into the L-containment field, Captain! - Emergency dive! - Aye aye! Passing through first layer of the L-containment field. Now entering second layer. L-containment field strength density is plus three zero. Dead ahead 12 o'clock! There's a swarm of Eva Infinities! No matter. We'll blitz right through them. Enemy vessel sighted at our stern at 12 o'clock! It's an ambush! Number 3 ship, The Erbsünde! We're between a rock and a hard place. This is bad! Our navigation will fail if we're hit anymore! Take out the No. 3 ship first. She's incomplete. Helm steady. Maximum combat speed! Aye aye! No. 3 ship is taking evasive action. Ram into her! Don't let her escape! This is nuts! Turn us around! Roll 180 degrees. Get them to take up our position. Aye aye. Using the No.3 ship as a shield, I see. Humph, she's as reckless as always. We've broken through the swarms of Eva Infinities. Now entering into the 3rd layer of L-containment field. Acquired target: NERV HQ. It has traversed to a position under The Black Moon. Unit 13's reactivation is imminent. The No. 2 and No. 3 ships are gaining on our aft. We're out of time. Use The Black Moon as cover and set course for assault on NERV HQ. Ready launch of guided munitions. Set target to Unit 13, readjustment sector. NERV Battleships approaching our aft at 6 o'clock! Adjust Wunder's altitude to minimize areas vulnerable to enemy fire. Aye aye! Blow port gravity ballast, down two-zero. Priority One on safeguarding our ships attached to the main wings. Concentrate our AT Field! Aft main gun hit! Heavy damage! They're beating us to a pulp! Hold it together! Just make it to the launch point in one piece. One-Zero until guided munitions launch point. Trajectory clear! Launch all guided munitions! Launching all guided munitions. We have visual confirmation of our final target, Unit 13! As we thought, it hasn't reactivated yet. Unit 13 is still immobile. Eva 7 series is inbound. There are way too many of them! Systems can't keep up! Forget the cannon fodder. Expedite launching of our two Evas! Maya, ready launch of Unit 2 and 8. Roger. Readying launch of Unit 2 and 8. Launch them now! Mari, Asuka, I'm counting on you. Out of my way! Comin' through! Grrrrrrahhhh! Ahhhh! Comin' through! It's hit! Yargh! Yaaaa! Four-eyed Crony, give me my next piece! Here ya go! Ah-ahr-argh! Hah! Princess! You! Mock Evas want to gang up and stop us from getting through? Annoying shits! - Four-eyed Crony, lend me a hand! - I gotcha! Grrrr! Nrrrrrrr! Both our Evas landed on NERV HQ! Our target must be below that crater. Damn it! You're such a pain in the ass! Go ahead, Your Highness! I owe you one, Four-Eyed Crony. Eva Unit 13. We made it. Even if they call it "God's Eva", that doesn't change the fact that it's the 13th multipurpose humanoid defensive weapon built by man. Once the shutdown override signal plug is inserted into the core, we may not destroy it, but it'll remain immobilized. This ends... Now! Yeeeeeeeeh! An AT Field? Unit 13 isn't supposed to have an AT field. Why? Wait a minute, is this my own Eva's AT field? Is my New Unit 2 afraid of Unit 13? There is something wrong here. What are you scheming, Gendoh? This is weird. The NERV battleships are pulling back. They're descending. That's the cursed ground zero of the Second Impact, the Calvary base! The Gates of Hell are open once more. Does this mean... The Wings of Light? Are they trying to start the Fourth Impact the way they did the Second Impact? No, ships built as the Guardians of Guf shouldn't be able to become the trigger. Besides, what's happening to The Black Moon isn't part of the plan. This isn't part of SEELE's scenario. This is a rite we know nothing about. A totally unpredicted Another Impact, I see. This changes nothing. We will crush any and all plans NERV intends to carry out! Ready our main guns. Take out No. 3 ship first. Every available gun: target No. 3 ship! Ready Super EM direct impact shells. Do not wait for calculations. All turrets: initiate fire. The construction plans specified No. 4 ship as well. Fire! Sit-rep! Direct hit! Our starboard and port secondary hulls have been impaled by something! Our stern has been damaged. Main gun systems are now down! The No. 4 ship, Gebet. We've fallen into their trap. In either case, the final impact is going to involve this Eva. We've got to take care of this thing right now. It's right in front of me, but I can't get through. Time for the last resort. I'm sorry, New Unit 2. I have to make things rough for you. Disable all restrictors. Backdoor code: Triple Nine. Pattern blue! I have readings of the 9th Angel within NERV HQ! Princess! Are you going to use the power of an angel? Ready Angel Blood. Full injection now! Help! Princess, you won't be human anymore! I'll neutralize the New Unit 2's AT field using my own AT field! It's not a single entry plug system? Crap! Gendoh wanted Princess to become an Angel! Shikinami type? My original, huh. The last Eva's form mirrors that of a god. All you need to do is accept me along with my love. Come to me. Sorry, tough luck! That's pointless, idiot. Asuka! All data links with the New Unit 2s have been lost! Pilot status unknown. N2 reactor APU: heavy damage! Shit! What do we do now? It's something like an Eva! It's attached itself to the ship! Pattern Blue. It must be an Opfer Type Eva. They built a Mk.9 and pilot from scratch? This is so bad! Our ship's being physically infiltrated! Expunge it now! We're trying. Contamination speed is too fast, we can't keep up. Mk.9 has broken through the VD firewall! We're screwed! All control systems hijacked! Well, this is a real pickle to be in. As always, Deputy Commander Fuyutsuki is impressive. The artificial recreation of Lilith. The Forced conversion of The Black Moon to become spears. The stage is set. How will you bring the drama to a close, Ikari? Confirming intruder on the forward deck near the stern! Commander Ikari. I'm sorry, Princess. I'm filled with unbearable shame. I guess I have to withdraw for the moment. It's been some time... Commander Ikari. I compliment you on your hard work, Colonel Katsuragi. I shall now employ this ship as previously planned. It's you! Shoot first, ask questions later, I see. As before, no hesitation to do anything to accomplish the mission. Yes, I learned that as being a virtue from you. Gods need no barriers. We accept absolutely everything that comes our way. Gendoh Ikari, You used the Key of Nebuchadnezzar and abandoned your humanity? I merely appended upon my body information that lies outside the logos of our realm. There are no problems. I'll slay the Gods, bind them with humanity, and through the sacrifice of Angels, enable the deification and fulfill the instrumentality of humankind. And you intend to sacrifice Asuka to do this? Answer me Ikari! The Ayanami-and Shikinami-type pilots were prepared specifically for this moment. There are no problems. Humanity? No. Ancient life of this planet is being commoditized. All souls are converted to cores, and merged with the Eva Infinities. Is this the start of the Fourth Impact? Correct. The Second Impact purified the oceans. The Third Impact purified the earth. The Fourth shall purify the souls. The cores that form the Eva Infinities are the materialization of souls. We'll cast aside our vessel, the seeds of man, and our collective intelligence will be guided to unsullied Paradise in this final rite. In exchange for bringing about the Second Impact, your father, Dr. Katsuragi, proved the validity of his proposal, the Human Instrumentality Project. I will stop my father's raving gibberish at all costs. Having tasted the fruit of knowledge, only two paths await humanity. Be exterminated by the Angels that have eaten the fruit of life, or exterminate the Angels and rob them of their seats before God, surrender our intellect and become the divine offspring, children of the Gods, and enjoy eternity existence. We must choose one of these two fates. NERV's Human Instrumentality Project was the product of SEELE choosing the latter, a feeble resistance against the Gods that employed the powers of Adam, nevertheless, a worthwhile cause to pursue. We will not choose for a reset of despair that subjugates ourselves to the Gods, and instead choose the continued option of hope. I have faith that humanity's will and knowledge will one day overcome the power of the Gods. It's all a matter of interpretation of the truth. Colonel Katsuragi, you are forsaking the world. Doctor Akagi, you are blind to what happiness has to offer. Human sentiments cannot change anything. All the horsemen have assembled now. So I will now have you return Eva Unit 1 that I lent to you. Father! We all survived the Near Third Impact. I'm going to believe in our luck and Ms. Misato's WILLE. Beyond the Doors of Guf is the anti-universe, a realm Wunder cannot enter. Sadly, WILLE no longer has the ability to stop the Instrumentality Project. We're at the end of our rope. Ms. Misato? I'll pilot Eva Unit 1. On my way back home after Ayanami disappeared, I noticed the smell of earth. I learned that smell from Mr. Kaji. Ms. Misato, I want to take half the burden off of you. Doing that means you're going to fight Gendoh Ikari. I want to settle this for myself. Wait a second! Are you joking? You're not going to let him pilot an Eva, are you? I was afraid something like this might happen. You permitted us to shoot to kill in situations like this, right Captain? You're a plague! That N3I you started made our lives a living hell! This is all the fault of you and your father! I'll never forgive you two. Sakura? Shinji Ikari won't pilot an Eva. Mr. Ikari piloted an Eva and brought misfortune on us and upon himself! That's why Mr. Ikari won't pilot an Eva! I'm sorry, Ms. Sakura. Please, let me pilot the Eva. You're talking total hogwash, Mr. Ikari! Once you're hurt, you won't have to worry about piloting. I know this will hurt, but it's better than having to be the pilot. Please forgive me! Misato! Captain! Misato! It's OK, Shinji. If you hadn't piloted Eva Unit 1 14 years ago, we would have already been exterminated. That's why I'm grateful to you. Even if N3I happened as a consequence. I am entirely responsible for your actions. I, Misato Katsuragi, still has custody of Shinji Ikari. I'll take full responsibility for his subsequent actions. Right now, I want to entrust everything to Shinji. That's right, we're all in debt to Mr. Ikari for saving us! But my father, and so many others, were lost to N3I! Mr. Ikari is our savior and our destroyer! This is all too messed up, but this is all we can do! It's all right. Let it go, Sakura. Let's just think about what we do in the future. This is... all so... Sorry there, folks! Doing some prep work made me late. Now let's go... ...doggy! Maya, get us the plug suit that's stored in the Captain's quarters. The bullet will dissolve quickly. I'll do first aid on you. It's OK, Second Lieutenant. Shinji Ikari, the only thing a son can do for his father is pat him on his shoulder... or kill him. That's something Kaji used to say to me. Ms. Misato, you should know I met Ryoji Kaji. Was he well? Yes. That's good to hear. He was such a nice guy. I only talked to him for a short while, but I liked him. Thank you. I'll back you up. I'm counting on you, Shinji. Yeah. I'll go now, Ms. Misato. Take care, Shinji. Let's get back to work. The ship is falling apart, we don't have a main engine or the auxiliary. It's a miracle we're still afloat. Yes, I agree. And we'll need to do another miracle before the backup power runs out. Eva Unit 8 improved is overlapping-compliant. By incorporating Vessel of the Adams, it's in an extra four-in-one state. Thanks to that, we're able to navigate through the anti-universe pretty easily. OK, doggy. Your job is to somehow destroy Unit 13 before all the anti-L systems fail and everybody above becomes core-ized. That's the only way we're going to be able to turn things around. I understand. But Jeez, Gendoh sure is sly! Taking advantage of the fact we're in the anti-universe, he's doing quantum teleportation. Catching him ain't gonna be easy. It's OK, Ms. Mari. I'll go now. Doggy! There's a chance the Princess's soul might be left over inside Unit 13. So the Princess... Asuka needs your help. I got it. Ayanami... I will come for you, no matter where you are! So listen. You wait for me. You hear, Shinji? I'll wait for you. Thank you. Good luck. Are you fine with this, Rei? Ayanami... Shinji... I'm sorry. I tried so that you wouldn't have to pilot an Eva anymore, but I failed. It's OK. Thank you, Ayanami. I'll take it from here. Yes, please. So, Unit 1's pilot has awakened, has he? I'm getting transmissions from the anti-universe via Unit 8. Improved Eva Unit 1 has reactivated. That doesn't make any sense at all! The troublemaker's synch rate was zero! Could it be that Shinji's true synchronization wasn't zero, but the closest value to zero? Yes, his synch rate is... ...infinite. So, you've managed to transform it to become Cassius, the spear of hope. You've got to stop this, Father! No, I can't. I have deeds... to perforrrrrrrrrm! What does that man plan to do by forcefully causing Another Impact? There can be only one reason for causing Another Impact. He had a new spear created to cause the Fourth Impact, but then he reserved two spears until the very end, probably to realize one single wish. That's so stupid. What an egotistical jerk! We'll be reunited soon, Yui. What? I can't move! Father, let me go! What is that? That is the Golgotha Object. Some, who were not human beings, left behind in this place six spears, the Adams, and the world of the Gods. My wife, your mother, was here as well. This is the Promised Land, the place where everything started. There are things men cannot change, except here. This is the one and only place, even Fate may be bent to one's will. Where are we? The Eva cage? What is this place? This is the world of your memories. Father? Our senses are useless in the anti-universe to formulate tangible perception. For that reason, the LCL has created a virtual environment that's recognizable. Hand over Unit 1 without delay. Then, you too will be able to meet your mother again. So you intend to put up a futile resistance? This is why I dislike children. Fine! We'll take the long way then. What's going on? Our moves are the same. This is hard. The two Evas are perfect counterparts. Unit 1 embodies hope. Unit 13, despair. They are synchronized and attuned to each other. This also is a rite of passage I must pass. Please stop this, Father! It's useless. Your feeble powers will not stop me. You still don't understand. You still don't... Your powers are meaningless. Violence and fear are not the criteria upon which our conflict can be resolved. That's right. This is not something that can be resolved through might. Yes, I want to talk to you. Father? Father, what are you trying to do here? I am doing something that can only be done here at the Golgotha Object. The Additional Impact that paves the way through which I may slay the Gods. And so to that end, I delivered two spears upon this land. MAGI-Copy predicts that Commander Ikari will exhaust the last two spears at the very end. Once all the spears are gone, Shinji won't be able to stop the initiation. Then what the hell do we do? We'll make a new spear and deliver it to him. That's impossible. Just how do you plan to do that? While this ship was hijacked and reverted to the Buße, the ships used The Black Moon as raw material to create unknown spears. So there must be a way this ship can create a new spear. When Wunder is imbued with human will it could work another miracle. I believe in Ritsuko's intelligence and the spirit residing within WILLE and Wunder. That's absolutely reckless. There's only data from when the previous formulation took place. I bet that's enough for you. I suppose. I'll give it a shot. I think the key will lie with the spinal linkage system. Maya, I'm sorry, but we'll have to do this on the fly. No problem, XO senpai. That's what we always do. Hey, Chief Boatswain! The backup power and the spinal linkage system is still good to go! Let's go ahead and work on swapping out the components right here directly! No, wait! You need to get out of there! Just being nearby that thing might harm you! Duty calls for this last job! Let's do what we can, Chief Boatswain! - This is the problem with young men. - Right! Let's get started on aiding Shinji before Commander Ikari does something nuts. - Yes, ma'am! - Yes, ma'am! Eva 1 pilot, there's something I want to show you. That's... Black Lilith? I see your memory leads you to see it as such. This is Evangelion Imaginary. Dr. Katsuragi predicted the existence of this Eva. An Eva that is imaginary and fictional, and does not exist in our world. Only humanity, with its ability to believe equally in both fantasy and reality, can perceive this Eva. The spears of despair and hope feed off each other as sacrifice, and act as a trigger. The imaginary and reality blend together. Everything becomes homogenized information. And thus begins the Additional Impact, the process that rewrites not only our cognition, but the entire world as well. This is the only means by which my wish can be granted. This is the Additional Impact? Yes, that's probably Eva Imaginary. I never thought it really existed. This is crazy. It's totally nuts! I see, so it finally begins. Ah, it's you. It's been quite some time, Professor Fuyutsuki. But I gotta say, isn't the L-containment field density pretty damn high in this ship? Well, this ship was never designed to be manned. I realize I'm being reckless. The ray of light called hope eternally shines upon humanity. but humanity also drowns themselves, clinging on to the malaise known as hope. I believe both Ikari and I have clung to the disease called hope for far too long. Gendoh's wish is to be the focal point of human instrumentality. I can sympathize with how you want to help him or actually, how your wish overlaps with his. But sir, I'd rather not drag down the whole of humanity with you, you know what I mean? I can understand. My job here is finished. I've assembled the things you wanted. Do as you see best fit... ...Mary Iscariot! Wow, it's been forever since I've been called that name. Righty-oh. Bye-bye. Yui. Is this what you wanted? We've gotten it loose! We can get this to work now! Captain, we can do this with just the crew that's with us here. Roger. All hands: abandon ship. All hands: abandon ship. I repeat. All hands! Abandon ship! Priority One to wounded personnel. Head to the escape pods now. All the Vessels of the Adams, the Opfer Type Evas, are here, I see. As always Professor Fuyutsuki sure runs a tight ship. Sorry but you guys... Nahhhh! You're gonna be meat to enhance... Argh! ...my Eva's overlapping! Now we're at 8 plus 9 plus 10. Plus eleven! All right, just... ...one more to go! Escape pods 1 through 4 have their hatches closed. Any remaining crew must rush to Escape Pod 5 immediately. I need to go. I need to get back to the helm. Our only job now is to survive. No matter how bitter it feels. Captain, the swapping out is done. I think we can give it a go now. Roger. Direct helm control systems to the Captain's seat. You are to evacuate immediately. Misato? Someone has to stay behind and make absolutely sure activation starts. And I have final responsibility over this ship. Ritsuko, look after the lives that survive this, all the children left behind. I understand, Misato. I will do my best. Thank you. We're low on EM power reserves. When all else fails... ...legacy reaction propulsion engines are the way to go, I guess. The Lilin won't be... ...needing you anymore. Rest in peace, Adams. The Wunder is on the move. I gotta join up with them. But, oh boy... Attempt to realize the instrumentality of both humanity's physical and mental beings simultaneously? So Gendoh, what now? Tell me, Father, what do you wish for? I chose a world that you refused, a world where there are no AT fields, where humanity shares one heart and mind equally. There are no barriers between individuals, nor disparities of wealth, nor discrimination, nor wars, nor abuse, nor pain, nor sorrow. A world of only pure unsoiled souls. And it is a very restful world where I can be with Yui again. Yui... Yui! Yui! Yui... Yui! Yui, where are you? Where are you, Yui? Everybody here is Rei? Where? Where are you? Yui? Father, you have to stop this. Why? What are you doing here Shinji? I'm here because I want to learn about you. I stayed away from you even when I was lonely. I did that because I was afraid I'd finally find out if you disliked me... ...or not. I want to know now. To know you, Father. An AT field? But I got rid of my humanity! Could it be that I am afraid of... ...Shinji? Me? This wasn't something... ...I should get rid of. It was something I should return to you, Father. So, you were just like me. Yes, I was. Headphones cut me off from the outside world. They protected me from the noise of others, helped me feign indifference. But when I met Yui, I no longer needed them. Have you chosen a name? Shinji if it's a boy. Rei if it's a girl. Shinji... Rei... I never knew my parents' love, and yet I became a parent. There is no question this world is unstable, imperfect, and irrational. It is a world where things breakdown if you take at face value what people say. People say different things at different times. Which is the truth? What am I supposed to accept? Probably the speaker was insincere in both instances. They were speaking what they really felt at the time. I feared forming bonds with people. I disliked a world brimming with them. My childhood was filled with days I was alone. So I never felt lonely. But there are those in society that would scorn such an existence. I hated going to other people's houses. I despised having to go to the dwellings of classmates that didn't interest me, visiting relatives at their homes, forced to confront the circumstances of their lives, and made to partake in their choirs. Being together with others was excruciating. I simply wanted to be alone, always. There were two things I liked as a child. One was knowledge. I could satiate the hunger of my heart by gorging on information on my own terms. You need not be considerate to others about knowledge. I could serve upon myself as much knowledge as time would allow me. The other thing I liked was the piano. A finely tuned wire would respond accurately to the key that was touched. There is no deception there. No betrayals. No disappointments. My existence would be seamlessly translated into a flow of sounds. I liked this system. I liked being alone. Neither I nor anyone else would get hurt that way. Alone, I could be at ease. But, after encountering Yui, I learned that living could be an enjoyable experience. Yui alone accepted me for who I was. After I lost Yui, I no longer had the confidence that I could live on being alone. This was the first time I tasted the anguish of loneliness. I could not bear the burden of losing Yui. I just wanted to cry with my head resting on her bosom. I just wanted to let myself be different by being at her side. I just wanted to make that wish come true. Am I... Am I forbidden to meet Yui... because I am weak? Shinji... I think you can't see her because you're not willing to accept your weaknesses. You knew all along, didn't you, Father... What's that? Oh, it's Ms. Misato. Nyahhhh! I'm not through yet! Impossible! All the holy spears have been lost. There should be no new spears left that could re-write the world. The Gods bestowed upon us Cassius, the spear of hope, and Longinus, the spear of despair. But even after losing those two spears, the will to return the world to how things were created the spear, Gaius. Yes, the WILLE spear. Armed with knowledge and will power, humanity has been able to make it this far without the help of the Gods. Ms. Yui? We got through it! Mari, go to Shinji. You got it! - I'll bring him back! - Promise? It seems a new spear will arrive before I could be reunited with Yui. How regrettable. As your mother, this was the only thing I could do for you. I'm sorry, Ryoji. Thank you, Ms. Misato. You've learned to heed the aspirations of others and accept their deaths. You've grown to be an adult, Shinji. Until the very end, I wasn't sure if Shinji was needed as a building block to reconstruct Yui. Fulfilling a wish entails a sacrifice. I thought a child was a punishment upon myself. Not meeting my child, not being there for him, I thought that would be redemption. I thought that would be best for my son. I'm sorry. Shinji. I see. So that's where you were. Yui. Gendoh Ikari... He was at the center of the circle, the realization of human instrumentality. From here on in, I'll take over. So, Shinji Ikari. What do you wish for? I'm fine. I think I can handle pain and heartbreak. I'm more worried about saving Asuka and others. Yes, I see. You've already been able to stand back up in the real world, not just in the imaginary one. Yeah, I've got to settle the score for what my father did. Asuka! I don't know Daddy. Mommy isn't around. That's why... You don't need anyone, Asuka. I'm gonna make it so I don't need anyone. Or else, things would be too painful. Living is painful. That's why I pilot my Eva. People might hate me, they may talk behind my back. After all, that's all I'm worth. As long as I can pilot my Eva. I'll make my body and heart strong so I don't need anyone. So, praise me! Recognize me. Give me a place... ...where I can be. I just want... ...someone to pat me on my head. It's OK, Asuka. You are who you are. And there's nothing wrong with that. Am I asleep? Idiot Shinji? I'm glad I could see you again. I wanted to say something to you. Thanks for saying you liked me. I liked you too. Goodbye, Asuka. Give my regards to Kensuke. Princess, take care of yourself. Guess she's gone. Shinji, won't you be lonely? No, I'll be fine. Now it's your turn, Kaworu. I now remember I've been here before many times and met you. Our names are alongside each other in the Book of Life. We'll keep on meeting each other. I'm you, and I'm just like you. That's why I was attracted to you. I wanted to give you happiness. Yes. Kaworu, you're just like my father. That's why you piloted the same Eva. Shinji, you're different from how you usually are. You're not going to cry? No, crying only provides solace for yourself. Me crying won't save anyone. - That's why I won't cry anymore. - I see. You have grown, haven't you, Shinji? I'll miss how you were before, but I suppose that's fine. Kaworu, I think I have to get rid of your Eva Unit 13 too. Right. You're casting aside the Evas. I'm sorry. I misunderstood your happiness. Exactly, sir. You misconstrued your own happiness with his, Commander Nagisa. You didn't want to bring about Shinji's happiness. You wanted his happiness to make you happy. The only thing that can end my existence is vacuum decay. That's why I have to repeatedly play a role in this predestined circular narrative for all of eternity. Let's do this, hoping we can get along. You seek a world with complementaries. Shinji, you never change. That's the very reason you chose him. and listed his name in the Book of Life. Thank you. You gave me salvation, Ryoji. I'm honored, Commander Nagisa. Oh, c'mon Ryoji. You can call me Kaworu. No, sir, not yet, Commander Nagisa. Nagisa means shore intermediary, between the land and the sea. It's a fitting name for you as the one that interlinks humanity. First Angel, and that which becomes the 13th Angel. Let's let him take over for now. Perhaps you can take up working the earth with me and Katsuragi once you retire? Huh... yeah. That sounds nice. You're the only one left, Ayanami. I'm fine here. Another one of you found a place she could call home. I'm sure Asuka will be able to find her own new place as well. A happiness without an Eva, that's what I wished for you, Shinji. Yes. So there's a life away from here for you. - Really? - Yes. I'm going to choose a life without Evas as well. I won't rewind time or revert the world. I'm just going to rewrite the world into one that doesn't have Evas. A world where new people can live. Birth of a new world. Neon genesis. Yeah. And besides, Ms. Mari will come for me. So please, don't worry. OK, I won't. Shinji, thank you. I'll do it, Ayanami. Neon genesis. Who is it? Ayanami? No, it isn't. I see now. This is the reason why... You were inside me all this time, Mother. I finally understand. Father wanted to see Mother go. That's the god-slaying that he wished for. Goodbye, all Evangelions! Booyaah! I made it! Just in the nick of time! Ms. Mari! Thank you! Unit 8, plus 9, plus 10, plus 11, plus 12. You did good, Final Evangelion. Ms. Mari! Sorry I'm late, Shinji! The train will arrive shortly. For your safety, please stand behind the yellow line. Who is it? Girl with glasses and big boobs? And... bingo! You smell real nice as usual. The scent of an adult? Well, you are real cute as usual. Well now! You're talkin' like a real grown up. Ah, c'mon, Shinji! Let's go! My first time at the Louvre was no big deal Because I'd already met my own Mona Lisa, long ago The day I first laid eyes on you, wheels began to turn An unstoppable premonition of loss We already have so many But let's add another one Something we don't want to forget Oh oh oh oh oh... Something I don't want to forget Oh oh oh oh oh... I love you more than you'll ever know “I don't like being photographed” But I don't need such things Your image is burnt forever On my heart's projector screen I was pretending I wasn't lonely Well, I guess that makes two of us Yearning for someone Came hand in hand with heartache Oh, can you give me one last kiss? A kiss as hot as fire So passionately that even if I wanted to I won't be able to forget it Oh oh oh oh oh... I love you more than you'll ever know Oh oh oh oh oh... I love you more than you'll ever know I already know Whether it's the end of the world Or I grow to be old There's someone I won't be able to forget Oh oh oh oh oh... Someone I can't forget Oh oh oh oh oh... I love you more than you'll ever know Oh oh oh oh oh... Someone I can't forget Can't forget Can't forget Can't forget Someone I can't forget Chasing after a breeze that blew by One dazzling afternoon If I could make just one wish come true I want to be laid to rest next to you No matter where that may be Beautiful world Beautiful boy If I could make just one wish come true I want to be laid to rest next to you No matter where that may be Beautiful world I only have eyes for you, no question Beautiful boy Yet unaware of his own beauty It's only love Day in, day out Comic books and daydreams He doesn't like who he is Not knowing what he wants Just wanting A lukewarm tear runs down the cheek There isn't anything I want to say I just want to see you one more time Maybe I'm a coward Who can't speak my mind Oh well, but... If I can't see you before my world disappears Let me lay down to rest next to you I don't care where that may be Beautiful world In the days so fleeting Beautiful boy It's only natural to be temperamental Beautiful world Beautiful boy It's only love If I could make just one wish come true I want to be laid to rest next to you It's only love English lyrics translated by Hikaru Utada THE END
