The Seventh Day A drama in five parts The Radio Club, was the centre for those with enough time and money and the happiness they bought in vain. Billie Blair, a spoiled child wrapped in luxury. Today is Monty's birthday. Monty Bellman, the Antony to her Cleopatra. Patricia Vane, a young woman who believes in the goodness of everything pure and simple. Reggie Van Zandt, the young man she had chosen for her fianc? and who had his father to thank for his fortune. Dad gave me this... Mom this other one... And my fraternity brothers sent me this. I realise you don't like it, Sir, but what with prohibition... They won't even let us drink our own liquor. My father's yacht is ready. We'll have some fun on deck. Dick and Lucia haven't spoken this week. They could be our chaperones. See you at the Yacht Club in half an hour. This will be fun! Captain, Jim Alden. John Alden, a popular young man. Picturesque nooks, where people live their lives, happy and sad, not giving a care about worldly sensations. Work is a pleasure, when it is motivated by love. Betty Alden, had not yet tasted life, except love and happiness that she saw in all that was beautiful and pure. Donald Peabody, who, from time to time, worked, but his real occupation was gossip. Katinka, the young woman who longs for the day when her Romeo arrives. Ned Alden, John's other uncle. The sea plays very hard games with inexperienced players. Would you like a cocktail? Go away! Can't you see I'm dying? End of the Part One. Part Two. Uncle Ned and I will stay on land. The next time the schooner sets sail, you will be the captain. Men do not start by looking for happiness in hard work, but that is where they find it. Even in the best ships the engines can fail, making any harbour a welcome sanctuary. How beautiful she is! She is! The devil himself has brought us here. It was the captain! If you mention the yacht again... I could be sent to jail for murder! Boy! Where's a hotel? There is no hotel here. Nor is there any railroad. So, what do you have around here? Nothing! Oh, let's get out of this hole! Inactivity is ideal for idle people, but when it becomes a necessity, it is worse than hard work. Captain, have us get out of here as soon as possible! It will take at least a week to repair the engines. What about training for the next match? Let's go ashore to practice! Excuse me, what are these strings for? She doesn't even know what a fishing net is! It started in Paradise and Eve's daughters also liked it. Adam was not so lucky. He only had one Eve. Some games are attractive, even if the rules are not understood. Look what Patricia found! I guess you don't know the shimmy? No, but I dance a little. What happens now? Shall we dance? Surprise! He dances on his own feet, not on hers! I like this! Me too. Life is wonderful when one is young and lives in the castle of one's dreams. There are still people who go to church on Sunday and find peace doing so. Fire? No, it's the church bell. I need to buy something. Come with me, Reggie! My hat isn't like the ones worn by the ladies on the ship. What's wrong with the warehouse? Everything is closed on Sunday! Do you want to come to church? The result of bad education. Come on, Reggie. I'll try something different. Stand up and sing. Patricia has gone to church. A trip that could last forever. He's coming for me this afternoon. A young man whose biggest problem is having so much freedom. A boat can become a blessed place. You are jealous! Have you come for the dirty laundry? No, I'd like to talk to the young lady. Which one of them? I don't know her name. Here we are. Who do you want? An old story, but always the most beautiful. Men think that love at first sight is silly, but only once they go past sixty. I didn't know that someone like you would come along... It is impossible. I'm engaged to Reggie van Zandt! How was the fishing? Don't you make fun of him! It's your fault! I hate you, I hate you all! You should stay away from that city folk and pay more attention to Betty. I could tell you things you'd be amazed. I would have married your sister but I don't want anyone who... Be my lucky lady. Roll the dice for me. We won! Let's go home, Betty. We shouldn't be here! He is engaged to Miss Vine. She told me so herself. Would you mind if we broke off our engagement? He told me he loved me. I'll teach him to lead you astray with his lies! John, please...! I know what you think, I'm no good. But I want to explain everything to you. Patricia and I didn't know any better. But now... it's all over! You're still very young. If your feelings have not changed in six months I will not object. I would wait ten years. This time it's for real. I've always loved you, Katinka! We're leaving as soon as Mr. Pell returns. Even if I have to drag him aboard! I envy you, John. Working on the sea is hard, but it is even harder to say goodbye to it. I'm going ashore! Captain, would you please tell John that I...? Here he comes. Tell him yourself.
