THIS FILM IS ABOUT THE CURIOUS STORY OF RAILWAY CROSSING GUARD PLATOW, WHO LOST HIS JOB IN THE EARLY 197Os DUE TO TECHNOLOGY. CONTRARY TO ALL HE HAD EXPERIENCED UNTIL THEN, AT 57 HE LEARNED ABOUT LIFE IN A RATHER UNIQUE MANNER. Hey, you! Got a screw loose or something? Who'll pay for my lost time? The Reichsbahn? THE SECOND LIFE OF FRIEDRICH WILHELM GEORG PLATOW DIRECTED BY SIEGFRIED KÜHN RÉSUMÉ I, Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Platow, was born on December 11, 1913, the last of 8 born to tenant farmer Wilhelm Georg Platow and his wife Margarete. The period of the First World War, which I still remember clearly, was spent beside my parents out in the open air. My mother placed great importance on tidiness. Without a provider for the family, the hard times that followed forced me, the youngest, to mature quickly. …if there's no more King of Prussia… I am the King of Graudenz! Come here. Come on! Lad, you could amount to something! When my brothers and sisters moved out of the house, my mother moved in with a disabled veteran. My new father was a man of principles. No, don't! After primary school, I began an apprenticeship at the Mixdorf railway station under Stationmaster Dollwitz. I learned railroading from the ground up. No slacking off there, Platow! Everything must be spic and span! After my training period fortune smiled upon me. I obtained the coveted position of traffic controller at the Luege station. On this day I met my wife. Bravo! Bravissimo! Who can lay him out flat? Capisco! I will pay a hundred marks to the man who can knock him out! The mighty strongman, the lion of the steppes! I'll pay a hundred marks to the man who knocks out the lion of the desert! A hundred marks at stake! Capisco! Who will dare? Who can lay out the tiger of Bengal? Aha. Come here, sir, come here. A hundred marks! Bravo! Off with the young couple! Oh, how beautiful! My wife gave me 3 children. One Sunday, we had an unexpected visit. - Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Cheers. How about a donation for the brave mothers on the homefront? - Is it voluntary? - Of course. Everything is voluntary one way or another. We merely ask. Well, if it's voluntary then I'll give… How much, then? Nothing. Some say times are tough for railroaders in the Third Reich. But you're having chops instead of Sunday stew. Nothing left for Winter Relief. It's a shame, Platow. Such a shame. You could've amounted to something. Two weeks later on the Eastern front: POW camp on taiga. War kaput! War kaput! Peace! Understand? Home soon. Home soon! War kaput. Peace, understand? Home soon. Home soon! The boy had been in town on an errand. It saved his life. Georgie! Hey! I returned to the rail crossing. I've been in this position for 34 years. Arriving: the P-112 from Hollemünde to Warmut. Where do you think you're going? Rennmark has summoned me. The big boss? What did you do? Train departing. Stand back! Have fun. LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT - You're talking about a person. - No, it's a piece of paper. It's a personnel file, not just a piece of paper. But you, with your dry intellect, you wouldn't understand that. What do you have against dry intellect? Nothing! It just makes me thirsty. The man had his position until '43. Widowed in an air raid that also claimed two of his three children. In 1951, he turned down advanced training. By the way, you offered it to him. Union member since '46. Eight years of schooling. If you see such a file as just a bit of paper, you're right! He's been at his crossing too long. He'll only get it once his tools are taken away. With one fell swoop he'll lose control of his life. Finished. - Sorry to disturb you. - You can disturb me any time. Go ahead. He earned respect before, but he is unwilling to learn. You can see that and more by reading that pile of papers. But… can we afford it? You certainly can't afford it. This is your seventh cup today. - Stationmaster Platow is waiting. - Yes, in a minute. The cafeteria had bananas. I bought a pound for you. Since when do I eat bananas? Here, for your kids. Off you go. Don't think your line of thought is foreign to me, or that I'm just a dusty bureaucrat. Let's consider the file from a different angle. Let's consider its spirit. There he is. A terrible stroke of fate: - His wife, two kids… - Yes, we all paid for the war. True, but psychologically he's withdrawn from life. His job exacerbates this because he's alone. I just mean that your approach is common: to make him re-enter life, open up the world of formulas and electronics like a big, colorful book. You say he deserves this! Even though we're not obliged, and society will pay for it. I'm sorry: It just goes against my beliefs! What do you want? Help him, ok; but take his own interests into account. Send him to some local line, where there's no new technology. There he can grow old in peace. Isn't that the humane solution and in our own interest? Forcing him to go back to school would be torture for him. Take the file away end the fellow in to me. And get me a beer. I'm thirsty from listening to you. - A beer? - Yes, and make sure it's cold! You shouldn't smoke so much. Stationmaster Platow reporting. Hello? You see, mate? Now it's my turn. Nonsense! Don't talk like that. You see? You'll be fine. I've been harsh to you railway men. I cracked down on you sometimes. I've been mean. I didn't give you any peace. That fellow was supposed to bring me a beer. You didn't like me either, Platow, already back then. I wanted the trains to run. I vowed during the war that the trains would run. Oh, you can't know how I'm dying for a beer. Listen, Fritz. It'll be different for you. Retire, manage a local line. Grow dog roses, how about it? Live a long life. That's what I should have done, but I couldn't stop. An old revolutionary… Our battlefield… Where is our battlefield? I'm dying… for… a beer. That's the last time you'll treat me like a dumb boy! - Have you decided? - Liver with vegetables. - None left. - Then with cabbage. - Also off the menu. - It's not crossed out. No liver with vegetables, so no liver with cabbage. Logical. Why is that logical? If liver with vegetables is crossed out, but liver with cabbage isn't, logic dictates there are vegetables, not no liver. Well, there's no liver. Logical? But it's not logical. You can't use the word 'logical' in that way. - Two Gourmet Stews. - Two GS's! - So, now it's logical. - Yes, now it's logical. But there's still no liver! This kind of thing really gets to me. I knew that I'd end up in the pub today. I can't handle seeing corpses. I shouldn't have become a doctor. I wanted to be a writer. I can write the most beautiful poems. The night kisses your mossy face. Bitter rain plashes the stream. How did you come up with 'mossy face'? Mossy face. The night kisses your mossy face. The night, the darkness. Velvety, midnight blue… Kiss… Lips soft. Moss rough. A softly stroking hand. Face… Eyes… This mossy face has a beard. Now I understand. The railway tracks get rusty, when the trains don't run. A man's soul turns frosty, without a little fun. You wanted to tell me something important. Progress is steamrolling us. We're being electrified. Finally. Your railway cottage will crumble. Your ramshackle crossing is going electric. Will you go back to school, or move to the local line? Take my advice, go for the local line. Grow flowers. Grow flowers? That's the second time I got that advice today. Three beers, three schnapps. Nothing too strong for me. I can't handle it. Just one beer and one schnapps. I've got to go home, my wife… What will happen to my crossing? Have a drink. Leave me alone, mossy face. What will happen to my crossing? Not even a little schnapps? Just the one? The crossing will be schnappsed. Completely schnappsed away with. Most uncollegial of you, Platow. Didn't think you were like that. Have you brought a nip with you at least? No? Shame on you. You should've been here at five. What time is it now? They're doing the same here as on the Warmut line. What, electrifying it? A little birdie told me. Will we be unemployed, comrade? Or will we go get training? Could you move out of the way! You woolly beast. Don't touch the dog! The switches will be changed out. At exactly 8:24, central control will take over the electric switches. Hey, Grandpa! Out of the way! Come on, Platow. Get to your post, quick! Faster! Run, Platow, run! Jack fell down and broke his crown. Here, we'll give you a hand, old man. - Hey, Platow, press the button! - The button! It's up and running! Look out, you fool! Reverse! A hot meal Or a cold brew, Whatever you want, There's something for you! Today the office had a visit from Stationmaster Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Platow from the Luege station. Stop. The current situation was made clear to him, comma, that due to the electrification of the railway line his position is now redundant, comma, but that he will be redeployed and assume responsibility for the Heinweg signal box on the local line to Falkenweser, comma, the post that his son is leaving to pursue further training at the School of Transportation, comma, thus allowing the younger Platow to be relieved by his father. Stop. This appears to all to be a most fortunate solution and one in keeping with socialist ethics. Full stop. Well, that was quite some effort. Your son's admission is ready. You can take it with you. I just need a signature. His colleagues say he hasn't slept for days. Always keeping an on the crossing. He's just too old. Come, let's go have lunch. I'm not doing it, father. You little imp! Going back to school. As an adult. I'd feel ridiculous. You imp! Take back this useless bit of paper. - Boy! - You little imp! You didn't leave Luege back then. You'll find something else. It's all the same to you where you end up. You'll have to adapt either way. - Grandmother… - Yes, what is it, Detlef? Keep your snotty comments to yourself! Is this seat free? What is it, Detlef? But you can see that the window seats are taken. Thank you. Your daughter is much nicer than you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Why is the train so slow? Isn't this the express train? Excuse me. The warning signal is shut off. Oncoming traffic. The second track is being laid. Lunch is served. What a slow train! - Are these seats free? - One moment! So what's on the menu today? Saddle… of… mutton. - Well? - Schnitzel with peppers. - One or two? - Two. - Anything to drink? - Tea. - One or too? - Yes. - No. - Now you've confused me. - Tea for her. Coffee for you? - Yes. I'm old, it's true. Dear daughter, I'm old and useless, it's true… At night you can hear trains from miles away. At first through the tracks. It makes a fine… how can I put it? vibration. It took me many years before I could hear it. You don't fool me. You're in your late fifties. I can see it. How? You dress to look younger. It's not my place to give you advice, but looking younger isn't about how you look, it's about how you act. You shouldn't look at a woman as if you find her attractive. I don't like it when people try to be what they're not. I know something about it. Excuse me, where do they sell these blouses? It doesn't matter. And the way you move is a dead give-away. You walk with bent knees. You can see through the trousers whether people use their knees or hips. You've got talent. So everything is possible. Growing roses would be better. Who are you, with your sad eyes? A princess with worries. And you? With the railway. You worked that out already. DIARY Werner Ossenberg. Platow. Hey, that's you! It's your turn. Admission letter, please. Thank you. - A six-week course. - Yes. How old are you? - 37. - 37? I would've guessed younger. But it doesn't matter. You're not too old! - Married? - No. You'll live in the residence hall. Well then, good luck to you, Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Platow. No, Friedrich Wilhelm Georg. One moment. May I have it back? Here it lists your name as Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Platow. That's right. That was my father. Oh, you have a father… Well yes, like everyone. How old is he? 20 years older, around 60. So very old. Oh well, we'll all be old some day. Good luck then. - Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Platow. - Yes. - Til we meet again. - Until then. Now here I die in peace In the arms of my friend Her I die in peace - The hours… - I'm Platow. I have an urgent question. What is idealism? Idealism? The opposite of materialism. You'll learn more in today's lesson. Any other questions? I have a lecture to give. Good morning. My name is Dr. Justus Fiebig. 'Justus' is Latin for 'the fair one'. I will try to live up to my name. Let me pose a few questions to see what you know. - What is materialism? - The opposite of idealism. Go on. You said we'd learn about it today. Materialism is eating, drinking, living, and not believing in God. By this definition I'm a true materialist, Doctor. A banal answer, but true. What is dialectics? Dialectics. From the back, then from the front, next, around the side, lastly, through the middle. Main thing is, get to the goal. I see you know these terms. How is that? 20 years of night school. What is class struggle? Good morning, Fiebig. So what is class struggle? That the tracks are in order and the trains run on time. I know you, you're… Can I help you? I'm sorry, I must've made a mistake. The similarity, though… - Where are you from? - Heinweg. The Heinweg signal box. - You're not from that dump…? - Luege, perhaps? That was my father. I remember my father saying, "There's no further training at my age," etc. So I said to myself, "You've been in your little station for 34 years." - "Back in '51 I had…" - Your father, you mean? Yes, as I said to him, "It was back in '51, Father," "that they wanted to train you, and you didn't go." "Did you ever ask yourself," "when the cold winds blew," "in the loneliness of your crossing," "if you'd passed up an opportunity you'd never have again?" And now someone else is doing what you did 20 years ago. Wait - who is…? Oh, of course! Your father. Because electron beams can only bridge a wider distance in a vacuum, the interior of the electron microscope must continually be evacuated. This results not only in a more efficient… Very good, Platow, very good. Excuse me, is this the Ditfurt and Klatow residence? 'Tis I, the galloping mailman. Telegram for Mr. Ditfurt. By the way, there's a concert tomorrow. You should go. Make sure you wear a decent suit. It's Bach's Double Concerto, performed by the Philharmonic. "Culture" "is every second heart attack of my life." Who said that? Erich Weinert, you philistines. Here are the tickets. It wasn't Erich Weinert, it was Hans Marchwitza. And it isn't "heart attack," it's "heartbeat." "Culture is every second heartbeat of my life." Or that way. Where's the bottle opener? What about you? Aren't you going? Today is a first heartbeat day for me. Anyway, I went to a concert as a little boy. It's nothing new. Moving, isn't it? - My shoes are pinching. - Shhh! I don't care for this one much. For what? - For this movement. - Which movement? Where do you think you are? Some beatnik cafe? - Come on, let's go. - Where? Where the prices are cheaper, the waiters less snooty and the music less loud and electric. Platow junior! What a coincidence. What are you doing here in this retirement locale? - We were just leaving. - Out of the question. First let's share a nice bottle of wine. Don't be a wet blanket. You're not your father. - On me, of course. - Great. - Have you made a selection? - Yes. This wine: it's dry, mature and not too expensive. - Two bottles or three? - Three. He's our professor, Dr. Schildt. We call him Shilly-shally. Teachers can't avoid being given nicknames. - And what's your name? - Malvine. - Shall we dance? - Youth before beauty. Shall we dance? Cheers. Cheers, Friedrich Wilhelm! Don't drink so much. Why not? It's free. Platow, you look much older than usual today… Strange! You look tired; shall we go? Cheers! He's like a tiger. He's like a tiger. As much of a tiger as a man can be… Stop this immediately! Please leave the premises! - We haven't finished our drinks. - I don't mean you. - Now, or I'll call the police! - Then we'll all go. - Seven bottles of Klosterkeller. - I find your attitude stinks. - I could say the same of you. - 79.10 marks. - I love you. - Already? Yes, totally. What is electricity? When the spark clicks! Now here I die in peace in the arms of my friend. - Where do you live? - Nowhere. - Come home with me? - I'll think about it. A freight train engine, amazing! Hey, Doctor, I remember these from the last war! - Your old man, you mean! - What? Let's see if the boiler still works! Come on! - Let's get her going! - Get wood! I haven't been on one of these for years! - Hurry up! - We've got the wood! - Rudi! - Yes, here! Come on! Take a look at this! You can be the stoker! A mighty blaze of dancing flames Oh, dearest mother stay by my side… Stationmaster: the all clear signal! Departure! - Is the bugger jammed? - What? We're getting her into gear now! - Take the brakes off! - Okay! Hey! You lot! Add more wood, stoker! Enough already. I'm bringing her into the station. Hey, where are the others? Gone? About time. Here. I saved this one. We can drink it alone. I've been waiting all day. Those two had other plans anyway. Go away. And shut your mouth. Rudi? Rudi? What? I can't do it. You can't do what? The schoolwork. You'll manage, Georg Friedrich Wilhelm. - Your body is strong. - But not my brain. And you, Rudi? How old are you? - 37. - I'm ancient. Come along. You rascal, you could be my son. You know that? You're so good to me. You must be in the Party. What? Stop. Okay, now let's get ready. Places, everyone. No dilly-dallying. - Morning. - Morning. How are we today? You managed to survive last night? Today you're the traffic controller at Wilferode. Now give the signal to enter the station. Right. Now the line is ready for the train to pass through. Got it? Good. Next to that. A seven minute delay. Not your fault, happened back in Walzburg. - What are you doing? - Bloody hell! Platow, remember: If the switch fails, the green light shuts off automatically. The G1230 can't enter the station. It has to wait outside. What's wrong, Platow? I've never caused an accident. I have an accident free record. It can happen to anyone. Don't take it so hard. Look, here's what we'll do: We'll put the train back on the tracks, and off we go again. VIGNETTE My back is slightly cold. Yes, that's how it was. Take a look at this. You must try the herb butter. It's really delicious. I want to tell you everything, but I don't know how to put it. You shouldn't talk while eating anyway. Bon appétit. I don't know if you'll understand me. What do you actually do? At the moment I write articles for the local paper. I used to be in the chorus at the theatre. And what's your training? At the start, I worked for the post office, then for a theatre obsessed technical draftswoman. Then nothing for a long time. I'm a journalist. Good for you. Writing about workers while you keep your hands clean. - Nobody sent us. - Listen, comrade. We weren't talking to you. So this here is the famous railway connector? The Yanks forgot to bomb this one. Sure are a bunch of idiots out there. Enough. Better go, the bugger's getting impatient. See you, reporter. Want an autograph? - 7:30 at Szeged. - Don't forget flowers! I know how to tell you now. A handcar. An actual handcar! This belongs in a museum. It's missing the lever and the seat. Also the crank. Easy enough to rebuild. - Is it worth it? - Definitely. Have you ever done something wrong? Who hasn't? And you didn't know what to do? There's always something you can do. Sometimes y ou don't know what it is and think there's nothing you can do. What if you try and still can't find a solution? Then you haven't tried long enough. And if you're sick and tired of trying? And the other person just won't help you? And it goes on and on, not just for weeks, but for years? Then you start seeing a strange face in the mirror and want to spit at it. Did you do that? What? I'm going to rebuild it. I can manage it. We can give it to the museum. I noticed they don't have one. You're a philosopher. As you say, my dear. This carriage was built in 1880 for the King of Saxony. The wax figures wear period railway uniforms. Comrade Director? This colleague has found a handcar. Please excuse me for a moment. - Come in. - Go in, comrade. At the freight station, a genuine '58 model. He wants to give it to the museum. He deserves some reward. He's a student here. He'd like to go to Cuba or the Soviet Union. - That's not necessary. - Don't be so modest. He actually just wanted to donate it. - Have you brought it with you? - It's not that simple. It's still at the freight station. It's too heavy to carry. It'd have to come via tracks. They'd have to be cleared. You need merely give the word, Comrade Director. It's not ready to roll yet. Very nice. See you later. Here are your two rooms. Very nice, thank you. So how do you like it? - Dieter. - Yes? I have to tell you something. Later. No, now. I'm listening. In the capital… there are many stages and actors. SHORT STORY One of the most renowned was Martin Wasser. No one could hold a candle to him. For many years he was in the hit play "Millionaire's Opera" by… the author's name is unimportant. He played the male lead, a worker. Martin Wasser's standard of living was not at all comparable to the financial hardship suffered by the character he played on stage. He… Money wasn't something he had to worry about. After he took off his working-class costume, he jumped into his Mercedes and whizzed home, where he enjoyed the possessions that he had acquired by playing a poor worker. A ravishing wife awaited him there as well. And though he enjoyed the company of other women while on tour, he nonetheless believed that he wasn't betraying his wife. He thought his personality was large enough for all. But she didn't think so. One day she told him that she was leaving him. Him, the great artist. Suddenly he realized she meant more to him than he'd thought. His entreaties were in vain. She fled to the city where she had once been in a chorus. She, who once lived in luxury, now lived in an attic and eked out a living by writing articles. When Martin Wasser-learned this, as he sat in his empty apartment after a performance with a glass in his hand before the empty TV screen, it slowly, oh so slowly, became clear to him, as slowly as the autumn leaves abandon the bleak trees, that she must've been filled with infinite disappointment. She had fallen in love with something in the man on stage. The good bloke, the mew man. But then this new man came home, sat before the tube and expected her to serve him. He snored beside her in bed and stank of cognac in the morning. He was brusque and unreasonable all day… until evening arrived and he became the other, the worker. When Martin Wasser realized this, what do you think he did? You tell me you want to try to work things out with your husband. You insist that you can fight for your happiness. But I may not. What kind of happiness is it, when one can fight, but the other may not? One will be happy and the other will fall by the wayside. Listen, you're a nice guy. Yes. Lucky me, huh? - Dieter, I… - Go. You're free to take off. I can't look at you anymore. Finally. There you are. She's gone. Up and left. The husband comes and, just like that, she's gone. I can't take it anymore. I don't want to. I know everyone thinks I'm a happy-go-lucky fellow. But for me it was serious. You're a child. I was very serious. Do you see me crying? Let that young upstart have her, I thought. - 60-year-old me. - You're 60? 34 years at my crossing, then it was taken from me. So backhandedly… You have to look for better things. I always suspected it. I knew there was something odd about you. And I always knew that I'd lose my temper with you. Here. Have an apple. Thank you. NEWS BRIEF If we weren't so used to impossible things coming true in this rapid era of science and technology, we might doubt the veracity of the singular story that played out at the Transportation School, unprecedented in railway history. Dr. Schildt, you uncovered this outrageous scam. How did you do it? I knew from the very beginning. - But there was, of course… - Of course. As administrator, how can you ensure this will not happen again? We have held critical meetings and resolved that such a thing will never happen again. - Bravo. That's sure to help. - We should've known much sooner. In 1945, in the GDR… As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, this excellent collective takes full responsibility for the matter. What is your opinion, Dr. Schildt? He recently caused a terrible accident with our model trains because he cannot free himself from his outmoded thinking. It was immediately clear to me that he is incapable of model-based learning. After reviewing the case, and keeping in mind the pertinent responsibility, we in Warmut democratically decided that the son… Yes, the son. - The son. - Well, you know… Who would've thought it possible? I mean… If I'd suspected, I myself would've… - I blame myself. - And so what happens now? Well… He must immediately discontinue his training. And I hope he will consider his actions with remorse. Let's ask the man himself. Where is he? Wasn't he just here? - What? - Dear Listeners, we'll find him just as we've found out so many other things. I'm a reporter! That man who just passed… We are always happy to speak to journalists. - Yes. - First, you must fill out a form. Then you'll receive authorization to access the tracks. But there's no time for that at the moment. There he is! What's that thing he's on? Well… It's a handcar. - It was invented by a Frenchman… - Does he have authorization? - Certainly. - How can you be so sure? Because you can't access the tracks without it. He's on the tracks, so he must have it. - And if he doesn't? - Good sir, that's impossible. All the switches and signals are controlled from here. Automatically. That means all journeys can be entered in advance and saved. Nothing can go wrong. - There's something on the track! - You're seeing things. There, on track two! - The track is shut off. - The D123. - It's behind it. - Can the D-train cross? Impossible. The signal turned to "stop" automatically. Now the object, whatever it is, is moving to the side track. All right. - He's blocked the track again! - That can't be. Is he crazy? I'm calling in the railway police. He'll regret this. I can't help it. You must admit that this person is very well-versed in the electric track system. He knows we're up here working for him. It's great! Come take a look at this! Has he completely lost his mind? Who can authorize me to access the tracks? Oh, drop dead! Stop! I take it all back! You've convinced me! You get an A! An A! Now stop it! Enough! Damn. I, Friedrich Wilhelm Georg Platow born at the start of the century and raised in difficult times, worked for 34 years at a railroad crossing. What is it now, Detlef? That's the famous railway man. He always goes incognito.
