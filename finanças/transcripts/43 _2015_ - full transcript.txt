(car horns honking) (engines revving) (dramatic synth music) (people arguing) - We're in the middle of yet another protest from the Mexican citizens complaining about their government, which is nothing new. This is one of the streets here in downtown Iguala. We have many, many citizens here, maybe 100 plus, protesting the federal police. The federal police, they've taken over this city after the municipal police were dissolved after the incident on September the 26th, 2014, when 43 students went missing from the school Ayotzinapa. (horns honking) (people chanting) - They took these kids away somewhere. We don't know where. No one seems to know where. - All this blaming each other began, like in many other cases in Mexico. As many other stories in our history, it went deadly wrong, and that's only one of those stories that we actually know about. It just went out of control. As easy as it looks, that you can't just erase someone from the face of the Earth in Mexico nowadays, you cannot do that without facing some consequences. - It's very, very hot, late June 2015, and we're gonna get to the school in Ayotzinapa to talk to the students, the parents, the administrators to find out the latest on this huge tragedy. (dramatic synth music) We can see the entrance of the school Ayotzinapa. This is an all-male school where they were studying to become teachers, people who were trying to make a difference in the poor state of Guerrero, to make Mexico a better place. (dramatic synth music) - When millions of Mexicans that we do our part everyday, we play fairly and we play with love for the country, and we move that country. - We are the ones, the good Mexicans are the ones who move our country forward, not the powerful crooks. (dramatic synth music) - This is the actual intersection where the buses were intercepted. The students from Ayotzinapa were basically trapped in this area right here. In the last seven years, 135,000 Mexican people have been murdered during this drug war that's really occurring in the United States. It's a war on people here in Mexico, and out of all those deaths, I would say that this particular incident, that occurred on September 26, 2014, has gotten the most attention. You can see a memorial here that has been set up to honor these missing students. - I took this investigation because for me, these students, really, they are a symbol of something that is important. They are people that fight against the injustice. They are kids that are very poor. The Isidro Burgos School and also other teachers' schools, they have this big meeting to organize the big protest for the next October, too, in Mexico City. They decide that now, in that year, 2014, was the work of the Isidro Burgos School get the bosses to be able to go there. So okay, that's your job, get the bosses. Others will get money. Others will get food. The mission was get 27 buses, and they have very short time to do it. How they do it? How they used to do it? Many of these kinds of public schools, how they used to do it, they stole the buses. They stole them, and they took them for some days, and then they'd release them. That's how they work. This is a school of teachers, very young people, that came from the poorest areas in Guerrero. Really are not common people. Ayotzinapa, Isidro Burgos choose the students not because the student is the most smart guy. It's because the ideology. This group doesn't accept the violence. They don't accept be poor for the rest of their lives. They don't accept the abuse of the power against their families, against their territory. (camera clicks) - Why these students are radicals? First, the society, the world should ask what have we done to them, what the government done to them to push them to take that decisions. You really cannot understand what Ayotzinapa is if you don't see each story of each boy that is there, (camera clicks) and each story is very sad. It's a tragedy. They don't have food to eat. They don't have clothes to wear. They see how the army raped their mothers and their sisters, and it's not justice. (camera clicks) - Those families don't have any proof that their kids are alive or gone forever. This cannot be over. This is not over, and this case cannot be closed. There's nothing you can say to a mother that lost her child or to a family who lost everything. There's nothing we can say. - I know that in that attack participate the municipal police, the police of Guerrero, the government of Guerrero, the army of the federal government, and the federal police. Everyone participate in the attack of the students. - To my left, you can see a huge sign here, a reward for one million pesos to help capture whoever was responsible for the missing 43 students. - Federal government, really at the beginning, start to say a lot of things that doesn't have any sense. So the first sign, the first proof that I got, really, really important, is from one court in Mexico. I start investigate and they gave the file, and for example, the government said, oh, we arrest to the municipal police. 22 municipal police that participate in the attack, and they are guilty, and they did it and they confessed, and I was able to get the file, and many of them were released. And the confessions are very different than the government is saying. - [Voiceover] Is Peña Nieto a murderer? - I think, as almost any Mexican would tell you, the biggest problems of the country are corruption and government impunity, and even though Mexico's a very vigorous democracy in which you can criticize the President in the newspapers, on TV, on the radio, and public demonstrations, often criticism and protest marches and demonstrations change nothing. The structure of the economy and the political system, which is at the heart of the problem, that is, the rich getting richer and the poor staying poor. Historically, Mexico's been kept down because the United States, its next door neighbor to the north, is much more powerful in almost every way, economically, politically. Mexico essentially supplies cheap labor for American industry, American fields. The United States sends hundreds or thousands of factories to Mexico and creates industrial production there but exploits the workers of Mexico. It's a very one-sided relationship. - [Voiceover] Tell us about the state of Guerrero. - The state of Guerrero is one, historically, of tremendous poverty, tremendous social inequality and endless rebellion and protest against local government and state government and federal government. (whistles) - The most famous city in the state of Guerrero is Acapulco. This used to be the ultimate tourist destination for famous movie stars and musicians until cartel violence hit this city in the last, about, 10 years, making it the most dangerous city in Mexico. - Very corrupt, despotic leadership controlling a population that's extremely poor. Rural farmers with very few rights, and many of them, especially in Guerrero, their only way to survive is by growing marijuana or opium poppies to make heroin, and these are people with few opportunities in life, little chance to get a proper education or a good job. They try to send their kids off to college, high school if they're lucky, really, but some of them get to college, such as the students who were murdered at Ayotzinapa. So Guerrero's produced some of the most radical movements in Mexico, such as the rebel group in the 1970s of the Party of the Poor and Lucio Cabañas. (dramatic synth music) - Iguala is a very historic city in Mexico. This is where the Mexican flag was born. It's the third largest city in Guerrero after Acapulco and Chilpancingo, which is the capital. This city has over 100,000 residents, and they're still reeling from that day, now nine months later as of this filming. After the mayor and his wife fled after the incident, a new mayor was brought in, basically a lame duck, and he'll be replaced this September of 2015. I'm standing in front of what used to be city hall here in Iguala. Rioters and protesters burned down a lot of it. You can see that behind me, a lot of the damage. Mr. Mendiola, good afternoon. - Good afternoon. - Charlie Minn. - Sit down, please. - Can do. (horns honking) - Okay, we just finished with the mayor of Iguala. Now, we'll do a ride-along with the state police here in Iguala. The municipal police department has been dissolved since the disappearance of the 43 students. The federal army, federal police, and now the state police have pretty much taken over the reins of the city, and a new mayor will be taking over as of September of 2015. You always see the presence of police because of the threat of violence, because of the cartel war which continues in this beautiful country. Because of the illegal drug consumption in the United States, unfortunately, Mexico has had to pay a dear price. 135,000 Mexican people have been murdered since 2007. - There's, you know, many issues that we need to deal with. First of all, this traffic, this drug trafficking, it's so big because the consumers are here in the United States. I'm sure everyone knows what their own responsibility on this and that is, not only in terms of consuming a lot of drugs here but also in terms of sending a lot of weapons into Mexico. It's very easy to blame one side or another. I think this issue is a core responsibility that goes both ways, on both sides of the border. - This is a very, very poor city that has had a lot of violence of late. My first impressions of this city is what I expected, friendly people, humble people but very, very poor, and with poverty comes crime. Look at this, huh? What is your name? The cutest baby in Guerrero. This is the Esperanza for Guerrero one day, right? And we will see if this city will be able to recapture and rebound from that devastating night, September 26th of 2014. (yelling) (horns honking) (gloomy synth music) - We are just moments away from the family members from Guerrero to arrive here in Juarez to try to create awareness for this severe injustice. You saw some of the pictures here of the 43 students that were supposedly murdered. (people socializing) - The reality of the situation is that what's happening, not only the funding of the cartels and of the Mexican military, is only by and through the complicity of the US government with the Mexican government. They know exactly what's happening. Those individuals who have any sort of education or any type of organizing capacity, through either unions or churches, are being silenced and murdered and run out of the cities, states, and even of the country. They have to rid themselves of a population that is capable of serving either as complainants or witnesses. - Many student movements and other kinds of protest movements, it almost always have been put down by violence, murder, and mass incarceration. These complaints, these demonstrations, these movements very seldom actually change the structure of the economy and the political system. - It seems like it's a national sport to blame each other when something goes wrong in Mexico. We have smart, brave, bright politicians. They're only a few good men here or there, you know, but they can't do it alone. And it seems like everything, all this corruption stops these people from doing good for everyone, and it's not only corruption but impunity. (melancholic synth music) (cheering and clapping) (cheering and clapping) - [All] One, we are the people! Two, (chanting in Spanish)! Three, we want justice! Four, (chanting in Spanish)! - We come from the state of Guerrero in Mexico, bringing reality, bringing truth, because we are very clear about the fact that the Mexican government and everything that they say is a lie! The message that we bring is that the night of the 26th and the morning of the 27th, our sons were attacked by the state! - It was a persecution! Our sons, we teach them to study and we teach them to work, and for them, it was a huge privilege to be accepted to the school Ayotzinapa. How can we imagine this was gonna happen on the night of September 26th? We had no idea this was gonna happen! Since they took our kids, 43 future teachers, we live in desperation! We live enraged! We live in indignified! - Since the Plan Mérida was signed between Bush and Felipe Calderón, the US government is start to send a lot of money to make more powerful the federal police, the army, marines, and many polices in different states in Mexico. One of that states was Guerrero. The US government, we never understand, that they were giving more power to institutions that are very corrupted and institutions that have a long, long history of abuse of power. I don't see any practice, how the US government couldn't calculate the result of that because they had proofs that shows that organized crime penetrate many of these institutions. I think the Plan Mérida is one of the worst mistakes of the US government in the recent history. The way to attack the cartels are not guns. You just have to confiscate their money, and you don't need a bullet for that. It's just a button, an order, a sign. You have to put in jail all the people, the members of the government in Mexico and also in US that works for them. Send guns to Mexico is like throw gasoline in a fire. - We're asking you to support us, to tell the government that they need to start an investigation! They need to start a whole new investigation, and also, a stop to Plan Mérida, the joint business that the United States government has with the Mexican government and the funding of all arms and military forces in Mexico, which is only going to kill us! It's only going to kidnap us! It's only going to rape us, and we don't need that! We don't need that funding in our country! We want that funding to stop! We demand a full presentation of all 43 future teachers! We repeat! We demand the alive presentation of all 43 future teachers because we know they're alive! - There's one thing that needs to be clear. No one will go anywhere and will stop any protests and any rallies until we know the truth, not the la verdad histórica, the historic truth as one of those guys called it, but the real thing. - This will not stop until we all know the truth. - If we really don't understand that now are they but tomorrow can be my son, my daughter. If we really, each Mexican, don't understand this, they are just helping to the government to destroy our country. They have to learn to say no more, no more, and this example, the case of the 43 students, is a good example to say no more. (gloomy synth music)
