Here, take this. Winter swimming is really refreshing. I wonder how you do it. Some say it's all in the mind. It's just a matter of habit. - When are you going to try it? - Around summertime. Let's hurry up, I'm already late. So let them wait. We have to discuss about that tourist compound. Factories, ships and now tourism. Will this ever end? I'm much like a football player. When I get the ball, I run hard! Good morning Mr Stavrou. - Shall I pick you up later? - No darling, I'll be late. - Has anyone arrived? - Only Mr Mavroidis. - Did Mr Romanidis call? - Yes, he's on his way. Good! Everyone will be here shortly. Have the helicopter ready. - Hey Hara. - Hey. Spare a smoke? Sure. Dumb matches! It's a shitty weather. My back aches and I can hardly move. How's business? Dragging... People don't party like they used to. They waste their money to the lottery. I'm off to see a movie. Listen... I work in a bar just around the corner. Drop by some day. Lots of Romeos there... - OK, I will. - Well, I'm off. Bye! Wow! What a hottie! Drop dead asshole! Get ready. Hurry up, don't stall. You're a tidy one, aren't you? What's your name? Nitsa. What's yours? Manolis. Well, come over here Manolis. Please excuse me, just for a minute more. I didn't take too long, did I? You're so beautiful! Wait, where are you going? Let me go! I don't want to! No use shouting. There is nobody around. You're very nice. I'll come again. Here you are. I'll be back Nitsa. Bye. Kostas, I want to talk to you. Are the blueprints ready? Sure we can see them later. Please, don't bother Mr Stavrou with those details. The lawyers will take care of the little things. Well at last! Romanidis decided to show up! - What the hell happened? - I was held at the mayor's office You're late! - I should've been in Athens by now. - What happened here? Nothing much. They'll make big profit anyway. - I was referring to the others. - No objections. Just asked for a bit more money. And what happens if they suddenly raise the prices? As a lawyer, you figure it out. That's why I'm paying you. Give me a smoke. Lawyer? You do everything on your own and you call me only when you blow it! Really? That hasn't happened yet. If it happens once, is enough. Eleana called and asked me where you are. Give them 5 days to clear the area and bring the bulldozers. We must be ready by April. We expect lots of tourists this year. Don't tell me, talk to the engineers. They have some problems. Tell him. The land is too soft in some areas. It's dangerous... You see what I'm dealing with. Call them in your office and give them a good holler! Give me your cigarettes for the road and pick me up at 9:30. Your cigarettes are expensive... How much do I pay you? - A lot! - Really? We'll have to change that. Don't forget to call Eleana. Yeah, yeah, okay, bye! What's up Eleana? What are you doing? I'm fixing the car. Please, don't. Why? It'll be fun. Eleana! In here. - Are you swimming? - Yes, in hot waters. Come sit down. Won't you kiss me? I was told you called me earlier. Yes, I thought I could find you. I left in a hurry... You know how it is. So, how was your day? We're starting the project next week. We should do okay. I think you're gaining some weight. I don't think so. Why don't you come in and check it out? Oh no, you slob! What's this? A boat. I'll sail away. How about going to a nice small restaurant? Not tonight, I can't. But we can go tomorrow for lunch. Are you leaving right now? At 9:30 my lawyer will pick me up. I have a meeting with some German investors at 10:15 I have to secure the first couple of seasons or I might fail. What do you mean? I mean I won't proceed if I'm not sure for the first couple of years. And how will you do that? The Germans will pay in advance to rent it for a couple of years. I'll use their money to start building the compound. I'll also put some of our own money in, but not a lot. I'll start building with that and then I'll get a loan. Give me the towel. I want to get out. Are you tired? Not too much. - Are you going to be late? - I don't know. Say... - What did you do today? - What? What did you do today? I went to see a movie. What will you do tonight? I'm asking you what you'll do. I'll take a bath. Hey, watch it! Don't sorry me you jackass! Why don't you look where you're going? Here! A keepsake. What are you saying? My name? Nitsa. Rise and shine! What's wrong with you? It's too early. Good morning dear! How do you feel? Sleepy. Come on, wake up! It's a wonderful day. Only it's too damp and my hair will be a mess. You see the problems I'm having. Now tell me what's bothering you. You seem distracted lately. What's wrong? I'm fine. - How much do you need? - What gave you that idea? Come on, tell me. You're here early and in a hurry. I'm listening. Anyway, give me what you can spare. Too much expenses lately... - Your expenses are impatient. - Don't be a child! - Why don't you bring him in? - Come on now, get on with it. And don't tell your husband anything. He found a new way to humiliate me. He makes me go by his office twice a month to get money. Imagine what, if we didn't own the business. I didn't want that much. Take it, I got plenty. - Besides, they're for a good cause. - Thanks. So that's the case... Twice a month... I didn't know that but don't get him wrong. He was poor not too long ago. He's been through hard times and wants to save money. - I'll talk to him. - You love him and cover for him. But think what he was before he met you. Just a failed deadbeat footballer. Mother please, you gotta understand some things. Go now, he's waiting. Bye honey, take care. And give my regards to George. - Bye mom... and call me. - Okay. - Come on Julia, you took your time! - Don't worry shops are still open. You've called for me ma'am? Indeed I have. Come in. Have a seat. Good... Now listen. I have a problem. I have a 12 o'clock appointment with my hairdresser... ...and it's only 9:30. So my problem is how to pass the time. Any ideas? Are you in love? Is he a plumber? No, he's a truck driver. And you're trying to save money for the wedding? I got it! You'll tell me your love story with all the details. Come sit near me. Really? From the beginning? From the very beginning. It was about 2 years ago. I was working at a clothes factory. One day it was raining heavily and I was very late. I was drenched to the bone and waiting for the bus. I was very late but I didn't mind much. I'd tell my boss that the bus was late due to the rain. Happened all the time. Truth is, I like to walk around when it's raining. He was sitting in a big truck. He was still an assistant then and waiting for the driver. Then he started teasing me saying all kinds of silly things. I started laughing, so he got off and came nearby. At first I was very shy. Then he told me he was about to leave for Germany... ...but he'd like to see me the minute he returned. I liked him a lot, so I got in the truck. Sorry I'm late. - What will you have? - I'm not hungry. Bring me whatever is ready and a beer. You're in a hurry again. Something came up. Wanna come with me? It depends. I became president of my old football team... ...and we're trying a new coach. I have to go. Wanna come? Sure. Do they still sell those hot dogs? Can't believe you still remember them. You forget I was watching you kick the ball for two seasons. Let's go, I'm bored here. Please tell Mr. Stavrou I'm leaving. I'll see him tonight. Got a light? Well, come on! Come inside. My name is Chris. You don't say! What are you, a pervert or something? What are you looking at? Come closer. Atta boy! You talk too much boy! But I'll pay. - I bet you don't have any money. - I do! Here! See? - Now you see them, now you don't! - What are you doing? Give it back! All that money? Are you crazy? I'm not giving them to you! Take your money and shove it! Go away! Beat it! Yeah, right! You should be paying me instead. Maybe I should let you handle my money. Sure, why not. Listen boy! If I wanted a pimp I could find one by myself. You're not cut out for it. And you look like a retard. Don't call me that or I'll rearrange your face, got it? Like playing tough, do you? Rearrange my face huh? Come on now, I bet you like my face. After all I'm just doing my job. If you don't like me you can go someplace else. You're too young, don't you know that? And you told me you'll rearrange my face. That wasn't so nice, was it? Get the fuck out! Thought you could play rough with me! Get out! Still here? Out! My jacket you crazy bitch! Open up! Your jacket? I'll make you eat it! Here! Go to hell stupid bitch. - What's going on here? - That crazy bitch in there. Crazy bitch? I'll show you! That retard tried to get smart with me. Yeah, I know your type. - Get the fuck outta here! - Go to hell, whores! Here comes Stelios. He'll show you! - Get him Stelios! - Come here pretty boy. Come! Don't be afraid. - Get him Stelios! - Watch out! Tear him apart! - I'll be damned! - He knocked him out! Stupid whores! Well, I'm off. Is Stella there? Listen Stella, as soon as you can, come over to fix my hair. Social obligations. Good, I'll be waiting. Social obligations... Hello mother! Hi darling! Good afternoon! Always gorgeous. I just talked to the CEO... Excuse me for a minute darling. - Do you understand? - And when did all this happen? Terry join me for a minute, will you? - Were their lawyers present? - Yes. - And what did he say? - The usual. - How are you doing? - Getting bored with a smile. And just to kill time, I throw ashes on your carpets. Some say it's good for them. - Like in your parties, no one is bored. - Some say only love can save us. Tell me, does your husband bring his lawyer to bed? But I forget. You hardly see him so you couldn't remember. Stop this nonsense! I say these things cause I love you. I can't stand seeing him treat you like this. Like your mother treats her latest boyfriend. - Terry stop it now! - If you wish. Besides a young man is about to interrupt us. I think he's coming for you. Just like a fairy tale. Enters the white knight. Would you join me for a dance? - With your permission of course. - If it's only for a dance, you have it. But if you're in for more... ...you'll have to ask for the lady's permission. Have a nice time. Fancy seeing you here... again. Who would've thought that you'd still be around... I think you're trying to insult me. I think you're quite smart for an ex football player... I envy you. You seem experienced with footballers. Quite experienced. And I'm sure all they got is their feet. Their head is empty. I wouldn't imagine you'd be interested in heads. Oh, really? I think you're mistaken. Everyone knows I'm a thinker... Not a retard! Ever thought that some day... I'll bash your face in? It crossed my mind... ...and I can't wait. You'll be in for a nasty surprise. I promise. You make me wonder... Although you have so many qualities... ...you're behaving like a parasite. I don't produce. I despise it. I buy and pay. I am the ideal consumer. That's why you need me. Without us consumers, you producers would be... ...the real parasites. How did you do on the tracks yesterday? I lost quite a bit. Listen here... You're making a fool out of me and I won't stand for it. - I don't understand. - Save it! I saw how you danced with that young girl. Quit bugging me! I'm entitled to have some fun. Not on my expense. And stop frowning. They're looking at us, smile! Why are you always so sad? Because my cat is sick. You're kidding of course. Of course, don't mind me. Come on now, don't be a child. Say... Would you like to come to my bedroom? I'd be honored. How about tomorrow night? - There couldn't be a better timing. - Really? And why is that? Tomorrow your husband leaves for London, didn't you know? Of course I did. - How long will he be gone? - Long enough... about 3 days. Okay then. But before that, you have to do me a favor. See that gentleman? - We shouldn't hurry. - We shouldn't? - You mean your husband? - You know who I mean. Take a glass of champagne and splash it on his face. - What did you say? - It's not easy, is it? You'll lose your job. You know, I feel sorry for you. Bye... - I'll tend to it. - Good! See you around. Enjoying yourself? I know you're always concerned about my entertainment. I'm touched. But don't send that idiot to flirt with me again. Have a nice trip. - Hi. - Hi, can I buy you a drink? Hold on for a minute... Hey, Nitsa! Come join us. - I looked for you but couldn't find you. - So? I just wanted to apologize. Do it then. I'm sorry. Anything else? Would you like to join me? Say... You still have the money? Sure. Then, let's have a seat. Please, bring a glass for the lady. - What are these? - Menthol. I hate them. Menthol... - Cheers! - Cheers! Should we go? I get it. You wanna do some talking. Since I'm not in a working mood, let's have it your way. - I don't know what to say... - Where are you from? Western Thrace. - What are you doing here? - Working in construction. - It must be difficult. - It's not that hard. - You know, I wanted to apologize... - Don't worry about it. - Do you have a girlfriend? - No, I'm new here. But I'll find one. Don't look too hard, city girls are prude. - You'll still be coming my way. - Are you from Athens? Yes, and I'm not prude. - Can you explain that? - What does it matter? I could fall in love with a girl like you. Here comes the corny staff... Listen pal... Falling in love is alright. But marrying... No way! - How old are you? - 24... Almost 25. You're still young, you'll wisen up. You'll become a fake like everyone else. I didn't get to finish school. Had to work on the fields. It wasn't so bad... But as I grew up things were getting worse. One year a heavy frost destroyed everything. As if that wasn't enough, our livestock got sick and died. I don't know... Someone must have jinxed us. Our village was deserted day by day. We were about 500 souls. Most of them left for Germany. They were sending us letters saying they're doing alright. My old man wouldn't let me go. But last year... Well... he died. I could find no work anymore. A friend told me I could make money at diamond mines in Rhodesia... ...so I came here to get in a boat but I stayed. It wasn't his fault. At first, we were doing alright. I was working at a factory. He was a truck driver. Made good money. Then we got engaged and I quit my job. I was hired as a maid in a rich house. We were talking about marriage. One day, I told him I was pregnant. That did it! As soon as I told him, he split. He took all the money I had saved and left. Never saw him again. Her name is Agnes. She's 5 years old and a resident at a boarding school. I don't want her to end up like me. You dumb bastard! Did I spoil your good looks madam? Watch how you drive asshole! Go to hell! Why don't you go there yourself! Son of a bitch, messed me all up. Stupid asshole. You shouldn't talk like that. There's mud all over my feet. Here... let me wipe it off. Thanks... that's better. Thank you. Let's go. You shouldn't go off at people like that, you know... Come on, let's just forget it. Come on! What's wrong? I don't have any more money... I spent them on our drinks. That's okay. This one's on me. Let's go. I want you. I want you. - Can I walk you down the street? - Only for a little while. I think this is goodnight. Will I see you tomorrow? Listen... I don't want commitments. I'll be here every day. You can drop by anytime. I'll be glad to see you, really! But no commitments. Anyway, we'll talk again. Bye for now. Look... I work at a construction site at Zea. If we lose touch you can find me there. Okay, bye... Didn't you go? No, I put it off for tomorrow. Last minute details... Are you staying in? If you want me to... - Be back in a second. - Okay. Are you alright? Eleana? What's wrong? Is everything alright? You look sad... Please, tell me. - The phone. - Leave it alone. Hello? You've reached orgy castle. What do you want? No, he's dead. We buried him this morning. No... Yes. Wrong number! - What did they want? - You. - Me? Why didn't you put me on? Cause it's orgy time. - It might've been something urgent. - This is more urgent. Don't! Hello! Yes, I'm listening. When was that? Don't shout, I can't understand. Tell it from the start. I know that, go on. No, no, you shouldn't have done that! You should've talked to their lawyers. Now it won't be easy. Okay, okay, now listen! This has to be straightened out tonight. If not, there's no use going to London. Half an hour, in my office. Bring your assistants, bye! Idiots! They'll ruin everything. I'll break their bones! - Sorry honey... - That's okay. The time is 00:34:30. Hey buddy! Does Chris from Thrace work here? Chris! Get over here! Hey Nitsa! - What brought you here? - Just dropped by. Are you in a hurry? Are you eager to send me off? No, I was thinking if you got time you could wait for me. - Half an hour and I'm off. - Okay. - Will you wait? - Yes, I'll be watching you. Tell me... - What? - Why did you come by my work? No reason... - Weren't you glad to see me? - Sure I was. I just wasn't expecting it. If it made you happy, don't ask why it happened. Just be glad it did. Nothing else. I don't understand. Neither do I. Police, open up! Shit! It's the police! They can't find us here! What are you so afraid of? Hurry up, get dressed! Okay. Hurry up, take this! We'll bust the door open! There is no way out! You talk too much, just follow me. Hurry up, they can't find us here! - Where are we going? - I'll show you, watch your step. Get on with it. Talkin' about bad luck... Let's go someplace and lay low. Wait! My shoe! Dumb shoe! Why don't you sit still? My feet... Where are your shoes? I left them back at the hotel. - And now what? - I don't know. I'll just walk like that I guess. Anyway... Come with me. Here you are. Thanks. They fit fine. Wanna go and have a drink? Sure! Don't drink like that, It'll get to your head. It won't bother me more than the other thing. What thing? Running off like that. These things happen on the job. Happen... Job... You gotta stop doing this! You're not on your right mind. You will stop doing it, understand? I'll marry you. - You don't know what you're saying. - Yes, I do. I earn enough for both of us... The three of us. As soon as we settle down, we'll get your daughter with us. This is no life for you. We can't do those things. I'm a hooker, remember? It doesn't matter. I don't care. Unless you don't want me. - Do you want me? - If only you knew... Let's get out of here! I talked to my mother about you... Told her everything. I can't say beautiful words but... I love you. Don't say anything right now. We'll talk again tomorrow. This is no life for you. I'll marry you. Don't say anything. We'll talk again tomorrow. What will you do with the young knight? I'll disappear... No need to ruin his life. Oh, the guilt! Where is he now? Waiting for me I guess. Poor Chris... - Is that his name? - Yes. What can I say... He wants to marry me, save me from the streets. When things settle, he told me, we'll get your child with us. Don't tell me! Are you a mother? It was all part of Nitsas' tale. If I'd known, I would've sent you some roses. When I was little... ...I used to love so many things. I lost them all. They slipped through my hands. My little Eleana... You have every right to feel desperate. But nobody values more than our own self. So forget the little country boy who came to save you from the streets. Stop thinking about your husband and his business. Just live your life the way you like. Maybe you're right. What have you planned for today? The first appearance of a wanna-be starlet. Comes from a low-life neighborhood. Lots of laughs guaranteed. Let's stop wasting time then. Can't stay long, gotta meet George later. What are you doing here, slacking off? - Everything is ready. - Good. Bring in the star then. Judy, sit over here. We'll have lots of fun. Come on, look alive people! Judy, get down there and start shooting. You there, get ready! Here she comes! Let's all give her a warm welcome! That's it, very nice! Judy, get some close ups. That's it baby! Throw some light on her. Shake it baby! That's the way! Stop! Wait! Hold on for a minute. Where are you going? I told you I couldn't stay long. - See you tomorrow, bye. - Bye. Ready to be baptized? Bring the water! I baptize the new super star, Katia!! Now do the dance of the seven veils. Better yet, recite a poem. Yes, yes, a poem! Good afternoon! Welcome! - Hello mother. - Hi honey. You look great mother. Have a seat Terry, please go on. Next. - Do you like it? - No, I prefer the other one. Here is an embroidered gown. Behold the originality of the design. - I like that, should I get it? - Suit yourself. - Hi, may I join you? - No, I'm waiting for someone. Yeah, right... Keep on waiting. Spare a smoke? Sure. What's the time? Around six. Waiting for her? Which one? Don't pretend you don't understand... Okay, I'll leave you alone. Well, do you like it? I like being with you. I like this a lot. Let's see it up close. - George! What brings you here? - I'm accompanying my wife. This is the most powerful, isn't it? Go upstairs, a customer is waiting. - Here again? - Did she show up? Not for the past two weeks. Did she leave a note for me? I'm Chris, we're engaged. - I told you, she hasn't showed up. - Okay, thanks If she does, tell her... I know, you'll be at the bar down the street. - I'll tell her. - Thanks. - One more thing. - What? Just an advise. Try and look for her someplace else. Thanks. How was your trip? Just fine! How are things here? Everything has been taken care of. You need not worry about a thing. Eleana! - Why are you here alone? - It's nice here. - Wanna go back? - In that thing? - Don't you like it? - It's noisy, we can't talk. - We could take a car. - We could? Romanidis! Send the chopper away. Stop it, you're tickling me! Stop it, I tell you! You seem so tired. We shouldn't take the car. I am. And I probably won't be able to rest soon. Lots of things have to be done by summer. Problem is, I'm alone. Can't handle everything by myself. I need assistants but can't find any. Idiots and thieves, all of them. Can't you let it go for a while? We'll go some place you can relax. I've been thinking about it, a lot. And you must be so lonely. You know... I used to have lots of dreams. Now I've almost made them true, I know it's no use struggling alone. We should talk more to each other. I used to live like this. Then, we came to Athens. Only thing I learned, was how to kick a ball. So, I joined a football team. Mother wanted me to be a cop. And pop, a barber. Can you imagine me a barber? But I wasn't listening. My mind was set on football. Ooooh, you're good! How nice. Goal! When we got married you gave me the factory. Now, I got ten. A house in Athens, 2 in Piraeus, a mansion and lots of cars. At first I just wanted to prove myself to you. But that didn't last. I was soon obsessed with an urge to create. Wanted to try my powers in things previously unfamiliar to me. It wasn't for the money but for the power that comes with it. You can do whatever you want. Everyone respects you. Here... for you. Damn... How long this will go on? Nitsa! I'm going. Nitsa! Wait! Stop! Wait. I'm not getting off, stop the car! You've almost killed me! Where have you been? Why did you run? Say something! Whose car is this? Tell me! Answer me! - Please, get out. - I want some answers. - The car is mine. - Where did you get it? - My boyfriend gave it to me. - Do you like this kind of life? - Can you give me a better one? - I love you! So does he. But I want to marry you. And what will we eat? Stop living like that, you got me! Why didn't you show up at the hotel? I was waiting. I was about to go there. Chris, it's no use. I had everything ready. I bought the rings and my mother was waiting for us. How stupid of me. Chris stop it, you're hurting me. - Leave the car, we're going. - Going where? My place. - We can't do this. - Yes, we can! Get out! Leave it and let's go. - We could take the car. - It's not ours, we'll get a cab. There it is. Leave me alone, this isn't right, can't you get it? - Just come inside. - Stop dragging me. Have a seat. Mother! Mother! Get up! Nitsa is here. Welcome. Hello. I'm so glad to see you here my child. Mother... The girl I was telling you about. He talked about you all the time. Come now mother, let's sit and talk. May you live happily. Cheers! I wish your father was here to see you. He used to say... ...I'll love the girl you marry more than I love you. He was a good man. Please love him my daughter... He's my only one. I love you, I love you. I'll never let you go again. I love you. Chris... Is that you? Good morning. Good morning. Mother... Be careful not to wake her. Tell her to wait for me. Sure son. Chris... Chris! Good morning, are you up? - Are you leaving? - Yes. It's time for work. Let me go with you. Are you a builder? I'll be back before you know it. You'll wait here, alright mother? Yes son. Let me walk you to the bus stop. I'll be ready in a minute. Chris... good bye. Be careful not to wake her. I'm sorry darling. Tell her to wait for me. Don't wait up. I got lots of work. Stay here with mother. I'd like to but they're waiting. Lots of work... Tell her to wait. Lots of work. Tell her to wait. Lots of work. Thank god you're back! We've looked everywhere for you. Say something... What's wrong? Good morning. We found your car abandoned. Will you tell me what's going on? Mommy dearest, you can kiss your daughter. I'm engaged. What? Who's engaged? I am... Last night. With songs from the mountains and prairies. It was wonderful. What is this nonsense? The police is looking for you. Couldn't you just phone? Why don't you stop it? You're getting on my nerves. Call my husband and tell him to come here. - You, prepare my bath. - At once. - Your husband has a meeting. - The hell with meetings! Tell him to come here! Tell him to come here! - Where is she? - She's locked up in her room. - I think her nerves are overstrained. - Please tell her to come here at once. Eleana, what's wrong? - Will you tell me what's going on? - What's the matter with you? Come in... Have a seat... Come in. You know how busy I am today. Let alone I spent last night calling hospitals and the police. I'll be brief. I hope so, cause all this pisses me off. This was my life for the whole winter. I can't do it anymore, I need help... help. Stop being hysterical and tell me what's happening. I'll stop. Let's just hope you don't start later on. Gimme a smoke. It is a very sad story. In the streets, I go by the name Nitsa. I know all the beds in Hotel International inside out. - What are you talking about? - For example... At Hotel International, there are 10 rooms and 2 toilets on the 2nd floor. My room was across the stairs. Number 9. The price was 65 to 150. You see... I was fresh on the job. Stop it! This is an outrage. These kind of things don't happen in our family. Oh yes they do! You should know that. Do you want to walk the streets with me? George can come too. You can meet my fiance. You don't know how much he looks like you. I'm telling you the truth. Julia, please leave us alone for a while. I think I'd better go. Yes mother you should go, you're late. I can wait. The others can't. I'll come back later when you're feeling better. Yes mother, you'll be back later when I'm feeling better. Please, tell me what's happening. - Do you want to hear it again? - Hush. I know it can't be true. Excuse me. Hello? Okay I'm coming, keep them busy. You can come with me. You'll wait in my office for a while and then we'll go some place to talk. In my situation, I can't wait any more. That's it for me. But... you're alright. Your nerves are a little tensed, that's all. I've been neglecting you honey, that is true. A couple of months in Switzerland will do you good. We'll leave soon. Please understand, I'm not sick at all. Everything I told you is true. Hush now, a good doctor, a little peace and quiet... ...and you'll be fine. Hush... hush. Come on honey, calm down... Please. I have to go, I'll call you when I'm done. Try to calm down. Bye. And behave yourself. Katerina! You called me? Please leave the house. - But there's work to be done. - Leave everything and get out! Whatever you say... I want to be alone. I want to be alone. Eleana... Eleana... Good morning darling. Eleana... look at my puppies. Eleana... come join us. Go ahead. Kiss each other. Kiss each other. Eleana... Are you coming? It's your fault! Eleana... Come close. Nitsa... Bye. I'm going. You're a dirty slut, I pity you. You're a hypocrite, you have to die. Eleana... Come closer. See? I'm the one men want! What have you done with your life? You're ugly! Dirty slut! I pity you! You're nothing! I pity you! You tricked me! You lied to me!
