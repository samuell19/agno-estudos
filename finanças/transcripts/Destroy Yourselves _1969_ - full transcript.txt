The Cinémathèque Française presents a film shot in April 1968 Destroy Yourselves What should I do? I could be you, or you... Sit down... A replaceable object... Suture needle. Mitraielle... Trephine. Wound sensor. Do you know what pain is? Thierry! Caroline, yes? You knew something happened! What did he say? No! For the last time, what was Thierry doing? Answer me! You saw him, you talked to him! Stanislas, calm down, will you, OK stay there! What did he say, exactly? I don't know. You're lying, you talked to him! Answer me! Yes? What? Thierry! Yes? Anyway, it doesn't matter because Thierry will never come back here again. Are you alright? No, you know very well I'm not alright. Because is your fault. Moreover, is always because of people like you. You talk about danger and let other people take the risk. If you still judge things through a nice little morality of sentiment, it means you haven't even begun thinking with your own mind. Moreover, you haven't even begun to exist, period. The best we can do is leave you to yourself. In any case, your words... Shit! In any case your words are nothing but noise to me. What do you think is behind these walls? Like on this side, there are people. You know, the other day I heard there was this guy, I don't remember who, he was talking about the United States... He said the real place for a free man is behind prison walls. Do you think thas true? Yes, maybe so. Because behind prison walls are those who transgress the laws that imprison society. Just as behind the walls of the asylum are people who transgress the laws of thought. So behind that, are actions without law and thoughts without law. Right. Also, the higher the walls, the closer we are to the core of the Revolution. How do you think we can blow up these walls? I don't know. We have to think about it. I don't know, maybe with a plane dropping bombs? What about the people inside? Oh, shit! Well, then it will have to be done on the other side, so as not to disturb them. That would be alright. Yes Do you think if all the freedom behind these walls were to escape and spill out onto the streets, it would take over everything? It would be like an epidemic. There's nothing we could do. Besides, thas whas beginning to happen in the black ghettos of the US. You know, when I was in New York, I had a friend and, he wanted to blow up a napalm factory I told him that I would do it, that I would help him. And? We were totally high, and we forgot all about it. We also wanted to fight alongside the blacks at the riots and then we didn't do that either. Too bad. Do you think one should talk about these things? He says he wants to speak with me, um... as if he were alone, as if I weren't there, because he thinks constantly speaking to someone is such a pain, and... so complicated. And... and he tells me I'm there listening, and thas all I do, that rather than just sit down calmly like this, I should... get up and do something, get moving. And that... One should do things fully. When I do things, I never really finish them. And is the same with everyone, they never carry things out fully. For example... when you fuck you should come, and... when starting a revolution, you have to do it completely, right to the end. He says I'm afraid. And is true, I am afraid. I'm not even... I'm not even capable of killing a fly on the floor, its legs in the air, just begging me to step on it. But maybe if it were a person lying there, begging me not to kill him, I would do it. And well, I'm afraid. I'm afraid of doing things and regretting them later. One should never regret anything, because its in the past. And the past is of no importance, except maybe to help project oneself into the future. Anyway, I think... people are afraid, everybody. Thas what keeps us from moving ahead. And also... one has to look at oneself and not think you're something, for deep down we're nothing. We are all nothing. And also... People have too much respect for one another, and is respect which makes us powerless, which prevents us from getting things done, which prevents us from making a revolution... He tells me we must speak, that speech is the only valid way to express to people the need for revolution. I'm trying to speak, and so... I'm trying to liberate myself through speech. I feel like the words don't come, as if there were a mental block, or maybe is even a question of wavelength. In the end, I don't know. There are times when I can't do it. And... And Harry says... that... to really love someone, you must demand them to become a complete revolutionary, and they must carry out fully all that they begin. And he can't accept this mediocrity we live in, we can't accept it anymore. So... He speaks of the nation, the government, the police, calling them out of date, criminal institutions. We've already lost the fear we once had for God. We don't even think about God anymore. There must always be something above us, before which we may be prostrate. If not God, is the king, if not the king, then the state. Now, finally, there's nothing above us. But, there have already been three revolutions in France, but each time they fouled it up, because of... too much respect for the people, for ourselves, for everything. And so... then, he says that... if there is a revolution, it won't be started by the proletariat like the one at General Motors for example, because they are the ones who sustain the bourgeoisie, and... their only ideals are their television and car, and they'll fight to the end for these things. And then he says that... if there is a revolution, it will be very bloody, because... the people who oppose us have already learned from previous revolutions... They learned and are now even more powerful, so... And they think they've got something to lose. And... And then... those who start the revolution will in any case be the minority. But that doesn't matter because a minority that truly confronts the majority can still win. Is an injustice that the laws are so stupid. And is true... If there were fewer laws there would be less crime because crime means breaking the law. But to make people understand this, we have to disobey more and more laws. This way they'll see that the laws are useless. Or perhaps we just have to blow everything up. We can't do like someone said, go out in the street and randomly shoot into the crowd. They do that in America from time to time, and then people say they're crazy and that this has nothing to do with the revolution. But we have to attack the ministries, the banks, everything that sustains society, And... and we have to surround all that protects society, like military barracks, and police headquarters. And... Stokely Carmichael said, we have to... wreck society so completely that finally, they will be forced to give in. Like in America, if the blacks... were to pull off an effective revolt, then perhaps some whites would understand and ...and that they... they might also revolt. Whites against whites. Carmichael also said is no longer a matter of race, but of class now. And... he said we must always be ready, in a revolutionary state within oneself. And that in society is the same thing, there must be constant renewal or else we'll end up becoming the bourgeoisie. Like whas happening in Russia today, for example. I want to say things but... I can't find the right words. So he says I have the feeling we must speak, that a real revolutionary before the revolution is someone who speaks. While those who shut up are not revolutionary unless they revolutionize. And... if we don't speak, we are dead, We are already governed by the dead. We're paralyzed by... the state, like by a Medusa's head. Only words can set us free. So... he says that he is only here because someone, some people listened to him, understood him... otherwise it would only be noise. Do you think is true? What are you thinking about? Nothing. You're thinking about nothing? No, I'm thinking of nothing. Why are you here? I don't know. You don't know why you're here? Do you want to say something? No. Why are you staying here? Because. Do you usually think about something? Sometimes, yes. What do you think about? I don't know, things. Things, what kind of things? There's tons of things to think about. I don't know. You don't know? Making the revolution. Making the revolution... What is a revolution? I don't know. You don't know what it is? Is to change. To change what? To change everything. Change everything? Can we change everything? Maybe. Do you know how? No. Is there anything you do know? No, not really. Do you know where you bought those pants? I forget, is not important. Is anything important? Is anything unimportant? Sure, there are important things. Like what? I don't know. Not one thing, everything together. Everything together is important? I think so. And you, are you important? No. You're not important. No. I'm not important. Why not? Because I'm one thing. And you know thas not important. I don't know, I don't think so. Are the things you say important? No. Are there things you want to say? Sometimes. Like what? I don't know. I happen to say things. You happen to say things? It doesn't change anything if I say them or not. It doesn't change anything? How not? What does change mean? I don't know. Nothing ever changes. Can you also say nothing? Yes. Why do you say things? I don't know. I say them because I say them, just like that. For nothing? You always say things for nothing? You don't know what you're saying? I do. I know very well what I'm saying but... In the end, I don't really know why. You don't know why you say them. How do you know you don't know? Are you sure you don't know? I'm not sure about anything. You're not sure? Why are you answering my questions? Because you're asking them. And you answer even if you're not sure. Yes. There is nothing to explain. Everything is sliding and well-defined. Order prevails over anger. More space for the voice. The deprivation of substance. The breakdown of automatism. Acceleration, the pedal to the metal. An ink stain in the darkness of the body. Behind the words, everything continues. To change your ways. To go too far. Theory and practice. A single gesture. To go too far. The only way out is to reach for the hidden recesses of loss. The only speed, light. Is disappearing. I'm in pain. No more room for the voice. Too many things. Yes. The invisible. Everything is sliding, defined. At each gush, like pebbles sinking in your throat. The breath trembles. Everything continues. You have to reach out. Paralysis. I want to speak alone, as if you weren't listening. Nothing is so annoying as hearing somebody speak endlessly on their own. We fall asleep, is so tedious. Life is hard. Others are hard. Everything is hard. Everything is so hard, we want to constantly change everything that surrounds us. You can't cope with anything, you can't really love anything. You see your body as an uncrossable boundary, and in fact, nobody seems able to cross this boundary. The only time you feel good is when talking freely to someone who is listening to you, who is answering you on the same level, in the same tone, as if you were two people thinking the same thing at the same time. You should stop thinking of yourself as a unique thing, as a unique person. Solitude never existed for anyone. This is the dream of the crowd, a way to forget yourself inside your head. Everything depends on each of us, you only have to want it. You have a body, genitals, a brain, and you hardly even use them. You act like you don't have a body. Thas unacceptable, unjustifiable, from any point of view, especially Goďs. You don't finish anything. You must use your body more, feel more, enjoy more, think more, enlarge yourself in every possible way. Don't respect anything except the things that go past your limits, take you far away, and allow you to forget everything, to lose everything you once were. You spend your time getting cold yet you are on the brink of tears, like us, on the brink of a revolution. If you would finally understand that the anecdotes of your life are nothing. You would want to throw yourself into the abyss there in front of you. If you would understand that you have to enter the impossible with no afterthought, no trembling, and even if you tremble... But you are too cowardly today, too cowardly. Every time you keep silent, every time you decide not to risk doing something that seems to you excessive, you lose your chance to make the ones around you more open to things they don't know. And yet... You think we can transform ourselves into energy? I don't know, what do you mean? In New York you feel it strongly, very strongly. There is... an extremely high tension over there... And... The energy vibrations are accelerated so much, you feel they're about to explode. Maybe the same thing will happen to us. We could, the energy inside us, could come out of us and transform everything into energy. We'd become like light. Do you like light? Yes, I like light. Besides, once I made love with light. Tell me more about it. I was in America, by the St. Lawrence river. I was with a friend. We had taken peyotl, you know, an American Indian plant like a cactus. You eat it, then you throw up. Disgusting. After that, it feels like bark chips floating in your blood. And then you're stoned. So, at a certain moment, she asked me where I felt hottest and I pointed like this. Just then, it took me by surprise. There was a glowing yellow stick from the top of my head down to my feet. It was illuminating me, warming me. It was very intense. She also had a red light stick, rising from her genitals tearing open her body. Would you want to repeat the experience? No. I mean, I don't know. Fucking light is better than fucking people. Which people? I don't know, everybody. People are idiots anyway. You don't know what you're saying. Yes, I don't know what I'm saying. I think is better to say nothing at all. I have to go. The state, the police and the government are reactionary illusions and thus criminal. The fact that they actually exist doesn't guarantee that they have a future. The fear of God has disappeared, the fear of the state will also disappear. The future revolution means to prepare for a life where the state, the police, and the government no longer instill collective fear and fascination. The revolution was never finished anywhere. Especially in France, which failed three successive revolutions. They were never even partially accomplished, because we're always afraid to violate what is most sacred for mankind itself. However... man will never be free as long as he limits his horizons. Man has beheaded his king, but he has not yet decapitated the royal idea he makes of himself. Every man of the people respects himself as his own king. In this respect lies his helplessness when he is helpless, his mental laziness when he is lazy, his stupidity, when he fails to take power. Is not the proletariat of General Motors today, is not the GM workers who will bring about the riots that will transform the world and allow mankind to change. Is thus in spite of many of those who ought to start the revolution that it will soon become a reality for everyone. This revolution will be as bloody as every other; especially because those who want to stop it, to make it impossible, are even more powerful for having learned from the failures of previous revolutions. But they will not stop the society we live in from falling apart, because is already falling apart in all the relationships that we have with each other. One day, a year or two from now, or even 20, it doesn't matter, the later it comes, the more violent it will be, people will realize that the values of money, forced on them as the only true values, are just as vile as digestive values. They will understand that revolution is not a law of history as they teach children at school to disgust them, but rather a fundamental requirement of the mind, the prick and cunt of their existence. They will understand that life and personal emotions don't matter unless they are the pivot of rage for all people. Then they will all calmly pick up their weapons. The easiest thing will not be to go out in the street, gun in hand, and shoot randomly into the crowd as Breton thought in '24, but rather to storm the ministries, the press, banks, airports, television stations, electrical and nuclear power plants, universities, and to do that, one must first surround the army barracks, paralyze the repressive system of the military by practicing civil disobedience everywhere, without ever forgetting what Thoreau said and still says and will continue to say: Every man who is right while the others are wrong constitutes already a majority of one voice. A minority can do nothing as long as it conforms to the majority. Then is not even a minority, but it is irresistable if it becomes an obstruction with all its might. We must live for today, whlie preparing the day when the revolutionary minority will become an obstruction with all its might. The revolution is beginning even as I speak. It is already present in the aggression committed by each word we utter. It rises up in the very heart of the demand for upheaval that speech creates. We need only follow these words to the end, to do it. The one who speaks is a revolutionary before the revolution. The one who keeps silent is only a revolutionary unless he makes a revolution. He needs a man who speaks, a man who writes, to make the meaning of what he does clear to him, resonate in him, expand in him. Nobody can innocently start a revolution. But it makes a far better straightjacket than apathy. France is proof of this, for the laws which govern us create silence. Like God, the state is dead, and its cadaver is everywhere around us, obstructing our horizon. If we remain silent, we'll be like the dead governed by other dead, our lives will mean even less than the silence between two sentences. The lack of speech will paralyze the revolution. The impossible is there in front of us, in this arbitrary renunciation that keeps us from moving past that enormous Medusa head, which today we call the State. We no longer belong to our present, our mind has passed it by. We've arrived at the bank of a whole different river. Our silence will scream, to make itself heard. I know that the people who don't listen to me are not necessarily deaf, but the very fact that today I am speaking in this way proves that somewhere, something or someone understands. Otherwise I wouldn't exist, and my words would be nothing but noise. First point: Practice civil disobedience as a rule. Second point: Expropriate the French bank. Third point: Destroy the archives of the Sureté and the police. Fourth point: Establish a Council for the city of Paris, composed of 85%% men and women under 25, both French and foreigners. Fifth point: Declare the army a decoration for public holidays. Sixth point: For six months change all professors into students and for the other six months ...all students into professors. Seventh point: Place a progressive tax, as high as 65%%, on the income of all men and women who declare themselves faithful and monogamous. Eighth point: Force the future minority of churchgoers to prove having had an exciting sex life for six years, and to present the details in front of the Council. Ninth point: The revolution will choose its own government. Tenth point: Declare that the revolutionary government will itself grant funds, willingly and generously. Rehearsal. Language is regressive. The illusion of the alternative. Join the sidereal appeal.
