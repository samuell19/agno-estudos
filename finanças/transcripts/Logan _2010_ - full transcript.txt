Alright, weapons on the table. Now that we're a team. We need to trust one another. All of them Bernard. Very good. Now we can begin. Now that I'm your leader we will move forward toward the future. The past is behind us and we must move forward in the right direction. We'll get there. We may not get there in one year or even six years. But we will get there. Get where? Where are you going? You know man, I really would like to hear this movie. So just keep your mouth shut. This is stupid. Just watch the movie. That was totally won'th $9.50. Are you kidding me? That movie stunk! They spent $150 million on that one. Didrt you see the action scenes and the explosions? Oh, and that poor Lamborghini. Tyler, it had no content. No story. The writer knew how to make things explode, but that's it. There was no emotion. No emotion? Dld you see the look on Vinny's face when he told them what direction he would take them in? Yeah, he said he'd take them toward the future. Exactly. You can't take anyone in any other direction. It's either the future or the future. You know, I could totally do better than that. I could see myself doing that. Making a movie. I have a great story I could tell. Yeah, I mean, I could see myself with her. Wait did you say something about a job? Do I have to work today? Tyler did you even listen to what I just said? Yeah, the movie, it was horrible. No, what I said about me... Dude, Tyler, awesome band solo last week. Thanks bud. Not too sure who you are though. Tyler! Yeah, the movie, I said it was horrible. Nevermind. Hey, watch out you idiot! This is the kid from the movie, that couldn't keep his mouth shut. This your boyfriend? He's my little brother you moron. Easy tiger, easy. I know its your little brother. Hey man, just to let you know I came to this movie to watch it, not to hear you talking. See you later bud. Don't worry about Gavin. He's a meat-head. Yeah whatever. I want some burgers. We could get some burgers. Let's get some burgers. Who's that? Just a friend from school. Just a friend? Yeah, just a friend. Who happens to be a girl. Wouldrt that make her your girlfriend? Shut up! Last night I... Hey Logan, how are you doing? Pretty good, we just saw The Job Part 3. Oh, how was it? Amazing! Terrible! I should get going, I have to get to work. Jeez, you're tiny. What!? No, when did that happen? She's perfect for you Logan. I'll meet you by the boat after work. Alright, see you. We are completely busted... We are totally busted. That's not even a real company. Logan, shut the door hunny quick. Look at them... What are you two doing this time? Not now, not now. Those aren't real boxes. Can I talk to you for a second? Not now hunny, I'm sorry. Nevermind Hi, welcome to Real Bean Coffee. How may I help you? Yeah I'll take a double mocha half-calf, two shots of skim latte. Let me check and see if our latte machine's working. No lattes. Sorry, no lattes. This is a coffee house right? You're supposed to have latte. Unfortunately our latte machine is broken, however we do offer... No! I'm going to Four Bucks. Fine, waste your money. Ours is better. When it works. Tyler! Did you just yell at that customer? No, I was really polite. Just go over there and clean up the spill. I'll handle the register. I didn't make that spill. No, but you're going to clean it up. Why don't you find the person who made the spill and have them clean it. Up? I made the spill, you are cleaning it up. Whoa! Bug on the foot! Yeah... Seriously dude it was a big bug. Like bigger than a cat. Bigger than a cat? I beat your tire swing score. Seven. There is no way you threw more than six rocks through that tire. Seven, I'm telling you. Dang'it. So what's that? Oh it's nothing. No seriously, what is it? Don't worry about it. So how's hobbit girl? Tyler, we're just friends. Right, that's what my friend Caleb said about Stacey two weeks before they started dating. Whatever. (phone rings) Who's that? Just a friend. How was work? It was work. Why don't you quit if you don't like it? And spend another six weeks trying to find a job? I don't think so. (phone rings) Someone really wants to get a hold of you. Did the latte machine quit working again? Yep Did you manager make you clean up another spill that he made? Yep. (phone rings) Must be nice to be popular, huh? What do you mean? You're like the most popular guy at school. Well, maybe, I guess. I wish I was popular. What are you talking about? You're the seventh grade class president. I ran for seventh grade class president. I got three votes. And one of them didn't count because you're not allowed to vote for seventh graders. Santa Claus got more votes than that. Santa Claus goes to our school? No he doesn't. He lives in the North Pole. It's no big deal. I mean, it gets a little annoying after a while. Plus it eats up our minutes. But you've got friends. I've seen them, I've talked to them. Like who? Well there's that kid you used to play hockey with and that other guy you've known since you were babies. And the girl we just met at the burger shop today. What's her name? Uhh... Hobbit Girl. She's your friend and possibly someday your wife. Ok Brad, the guy I used to play hockey with, he's like too obsessed with hockey and I'm not that good. And Matt the so called friend since we were babies, weirded out last year. He's a drugee now. Besides, me and Allison have been dating. Cool. Wait, what? You're not even paying attention. Sorry, but you're friends with a hobbit. How cool is that? And my friends like you. And you got me. You're a cool kid Logan. Come on, it's probably time for dinner. Logan, your friend came to join us. Yeah, so I was just walking by and saw the new neighbors, and then your mom yelled out the door and was like, "Allison, get in the house quick!" So here I am. Alright well, what's up? Mom, they're just neighbors. Oh, that's what they want you to think. Let me tell you. I'm sure as Elvis is alive, they are not any ordinary neighbors. Can we just eat? Please? So, Allison I had this idea... Do you live in a hole? No a hollowed out tree trunk. Havert you ever seen it down the street before? Sorry, what were you saying bud? Oh well I had this idea that I wanted to do... John Lennon was completely taken out by the government! What? Hoover and Nixon were out to get him They hired this guy to knock him off. Yeah, he was a lunatic. Well he was a lunatic, but he was a lunatic hired by the government. For what purpose? Because Lennon was... Can you guys just stop? Dad! Stop! Tyler, this is important information ok? If it's that important, you can make a TV show about it. Right, the tube is completely controlled by the man. You, your brother, your mother, me we'd all be locked up for life. They'd throw away the key. Very nice dinner Mrs. Hoffman Thank you. She's like this tall You have to marry her. Get out of here. Hey. Yeah? Allisors mom starts a new job tomorrow and Allison was wondering if she could get a ride to school? Sure, I can hear the wedding bells! Good night Tyler! How'd you get in? So where were you yesterday morning? You ask me this every Monday, and the answer's always the same. Right, church. And you tell me the same thing every Monday after I ask. And I'll say it again. You should really come sometime. Well while you were hopping pews and throwing away your money, me and Logan went and saw the new David Clevenger film. Oh that's sick. The Job Part 3? And that wasrt throwing away money? So it wasrt good? No, it was great! Not! So do you need a ride? No, I'm good. I got my bike. Because it's seriously not a problem. No seriously, I got the bike. Alright. See you in third hour. I'll be in the car Logan. Hurry up. What? Well, go get her. This isn't a date. Honk the horn. (car horn) What are you waiting for? Whoa! How did she get in the back seat? Oh my gosh. Did you like that art project? What art project? The one I showed you last Friday. You didn't even look at it? The sculpture I made from your broken drum sticks. Oh that one. Yeah, it was good. Now you're just saying that. No seriously Logan, I liked it. So when are you going to ask the girl in the back seat on a date? Tyler seriously, the road, not us. Fine little brother. Do your parents have to buy you special furniture? Like doll chairs and tables and sofas? No actually my parents decorated our house like a Japanese pagoda so we sit on the floor. Really? That is so cool. Isn't it Logan? Mr. Hoffman. Oh Principal Ward. How are you doing? I was doing better until I found out that you used the school's copy paper for your own personal reasons. I'm sorry Mr. Ward. I ran out of paper and I had to write something down. Well if you were taking notes for a class, that's understandable. Definitely for class. But let me remind you again. School property is only for school purposes. I'm sorry. It won't happen again. Good. Carry on. Class, I'm handing back your essays on influential poets of the 18th Century. Some of you will not be pleased. I know I wasrt. 23%? Logan, this stuff shouldn't be hard for you. You're a great writer. And you have a good eye for story. But you're not paying attention. Yeah, I've been busy. What are you writing in there? It's just a project. A writing project. I don't want to jynx it by talking about it yet. I can respect that. And for the rest of you who are wondering Edgar Allen Poe was not born in 1975 and he did not play for the Miami Dolphins. Here, hand the rest of these out. Mr. Spradley. What's up with this? This is Sebastian new drummer in the school. I thought I'd give him a try. He's a freshman. Think of it as baseball. Every good coach has a reliever in the bullpen in case the pitcher gets tired. I never get tired. What's up I'm Sebastian. You're on my throne. Sorry, I was just keeping it warm for you. Thanks. Wait, another one please. Sorry, can't. I got to eat. Come on, one more. Ok, one more song. But then I got to eat my lunch. Are we ever going to work on this project? What? Suddenly I can't sit here anymore? Nope, you're not really my crowd. Hey what's with these long sleeves? I get cold easily. You must always be cold. Have you started working on your art project for Deeney? No, my partner Neal Schon won't stop playing his guitar. Ok ladies, sorry. I need to stop. So, where were we on the project? (bell rings) Thank you Mr. Hendrix, now we have nothing done. Wow, you really think I'm that good? Don't worry we'll get it done. Let's go. Whoa, whoa... where's your car seat? Don't you know it's against the law to have a child in the car without a car seat? Oh no, I left it with my sippy cup. Good one. Where's all your stuff? Right here. That's it? That's all you have? So you don't have any homework? Not really. That is so not fair Do you know how much homework I have? Hey, what's it take to rent out a school? Why do you want to rent out a school? Just a project I'm working on. You're not going to try to have another indoor paintball tournament are you? Because we all know that idea never happened. What about microphones? Dude, last time you tried to have your own concert didn't go over so well either. No one wanted to watch an 11 year old play the recorder. Hey, did you hear my Hot Cross Buns solo? I held that high note for like 10 seconds. It was flawless. And yet you were still shown up by that other kid. What was his name. Trevor? Tanner? Trent? Timmy? Troy? Sam. That's it. His recorder was cooler than yours. Whatever. What about cameras and stuff? Disposable cameras? Well you take them to the fat bald guy behind the counter No, I mean... nevermind. What is this project anyway? It's just a project. Dude is this for my surprise birthday party? The one I'm not really supposed to know about? No. I mean it's alright if it is, I'll still act surprised, I promise. No, that's not what I'm talking about. Is my friend Matt going to jump out of the cake? No, that's not it! Is Ben going to be in the pinata? What if Gavin was the pinata? No, that's not it! Stupid latte machine. Make lattes. Tyler! No wonder it doesn't work. You keep hitting it. You're on mop duty. Ok, it stopped working before I hit it. That doesn't matter. And where are all my employees? Tell me what's the point of making a schedule if nobody looks at it? I'm going to go make another schedule. See what I have to deal with? What's his name? Jerk. Jerk? You remember that movie we saw? No. Yeah you do. What movie? The movie before you met Allison. Who's Allison? Shut up. Oh, you mean Hobbit Girl? So what about this movie? Well it kind of inspired me to do something a little crazy. Like what? Well I'm writing a movie. I'm going to produce it this summer. Like when you tried to train to become an Olympic heavy- weight wrestler? Or when you thought you could be a Michael Jackson impersonator? Hey that one would've worked too. Dude too soon. So you really think you can make this movie? Yeah, I do. This is something I'm really serious about. And you werert serious the other times? No. Well, maybe. Just a little. But I'm totally serious this time. This is something that I really want to do. Because of the money or the fame? Neither Tyler. For the story. Alright, let me see it then. Well it's kind of in progress. Dude, I want to read it. Hand it over. Well you're probably busy with stuff, you know drums, school Logan, I'm your brother. I can't read it unless you give it to me. I always have time for you. I don't know how good it is. Where's your confidence? Let me know what you think when you finish it. Alright. What happened to you? Long night. Are you going to ride with us today? Why do you insist on me riding with you? Why do you insist on taking a bike? I like the bike. Oh, Tyler, what did you think? Did you like it? Was it good? He didn't like it. What did you think? Was it good? Read what? We have to go, can you hurry up? Just tell me, what did you think? Tyler? Tyler? Read what? So did you like it? What'd you think? Was it good? Chill, I didn't even have... You didn't like it did you? No, I didn't know you were such a good writer. Really, you liked it? Yeah, it blew me away. It even looked professional. Oh, thanks man. But you're serious about making this movie? Yeah, I don't know how I'm going to find all the help You could ask around at school. Easy for you, everyone likes you. You could get anyone to help you. Just try it, trust me, it'll work. I don't think so. You could always make flyers or something. Add a hat and you would look just like a Smurfette. Very funny. How'd you beat me? Again. The bike. Scholars! Today we are working with charcoal. The key to using charcoal is to make one continuous motion. Don't start and stop. You want to start at the top and work down. Start at the left side. Deeney! Deeney! You don't want to get charcoal on the back of your hand. Deeney! If you are left handed... what Tyler? I forgot. The call kind of threw me off. Ok Tyler, the Boy Meets World references stop today. Stop interupting me. Come on Deeney. I will take you to the office. You wouldn't do that. You're right, I can't stay mad at you. Alright, everybody start with a piece of big paper. Hey Tyler Do you want to help hand these out? You printed flyers, nice. I'll help. Where'd you print these at anyway? Computer lab, first hour. Don't let Principal Ward catch you, or else he'll kill you. Alright See you later man. Here you go, I'm making a movie. Here you go. What, what do you want? You're making a movie? Yeah. Yeah right, like you could ever do anything cool? You're such a little butthead. I should've studied. What's wrong now? I failed my math test. 49% That's not the worse I've seen. Since when does the guy who's good at everything fail tests? Werert you up all last night studying? I was up, but I was reading something, actually, I don't know what I was doing. I got distracted I think I was playing that game on my phone, you know the one with the bubbles and you pop them? I'm going to go study. He's really taking that one test seriously. Have you met his parents? Hey man, how long have you been playing? Since I was seven. You play? No, I'm a drummer. That's sick. You're new here, aren't you? Yeah. Eat with us. Thanks. I'll have to introduce you to Tyler too. He's a drummer, he just left though. I think I already met him. You passed Allisors house. Why would we stop at Allisors house? Hello? Ah, there you are. What, no comeback? I'm going to have to let you off here. I can't be late for work again. So I guess I'll see you tomorrow. I guess so. It's really nice of you and Tyler to give me a ride everyday. Well it's not like you live very far. I know, but thank you. Yeah. So I'm making a movie would you like to help? Yeah, that'd be fun. But I don't really know what I'd be able to do. I'm not really good at all that technical stuff, and I don't act. Ok, I get it, if you don't want to help just tell me. I understand. No, I do. I just don't know how. Yeah, whatever. I do want to help though. What are you doing? This place is a mess. Clean it up. I just did. Yeah well I didn't see you do it. So do it again. Lawrence Films, may I help you? Hi, can I talk to Mr. Lawrence? I'm sorry but Mr. Lawrence is unavailable right now and he's not taking any calls Is there something I can help you with? Can I call him later? Actually no, he's in the middle of a big production right now and he can't be disturbed. That's ok. Thanks. Stupid movie people. I knew you'd call back. Hello? Oh sorry hun, I dialed the wrong number. Good luck. Don't ever get a job. Managers are stupid jerks. What happened? Doesrt matter. How's the girl friend? I know, you're just friends. You know she loves you though. Whatever. How's school? You've been paying attention? Allison said you're not. You're not, are you? Don't worry, I'll catch up. Alright, just don't let dad find out. Come on, time to eat. When were you talking to Allison? Tyler don't you have a band concert on Saturday or something? Yeah, I still need to practice. Oh, I'm sure you'll be fine. How about you Logan? Anything new and exciting? I'm making a movie. That's nice How about school? No, I mean a real movie for theaters and producers and stuff. I've been writing it. Good Logan. That's a good way to get yourself blacklisted by the Federal Government. Why don't you try something a little bit more... obtainable? Yeah, like Tyler just focus on school, get a law degree so you can fight the government. That's all you got to do. Keep those A's coming Tyler. Can you pass me the bread? I guess that means I shouldn't ask you guys for help. Do you think they're right? Why don't you try something more obtainable? Don't worry about them Logan. Do you even listen to the kind of stuff they talk about? Yeah, I try to tune that stuff out. But what if they are right? I mean, has a 13 year old ever made a movie? Probably not. But I think you can. You're the only one. What are you doing here? I have a theory. Here we go with more theories. Hold this. What's your theory? That you can't go more than 1.9 seconds without twirling a drum stick. Ok, seriously why are you here? Hello, Deeney's art project? It's due tomorrow. That is my cue to leave. I completely forgot Let's get started. Ok, hold on one second. Man, you look even worse today. I'm so tired dude. Last night was a long night. Yeah, especially for those who actually stay up to finish the project. I'm sure Deeney will be impressed. We have to go. Logan, make me a sandwich. I'm not making you a sandwich. Do you want a ride to school? Do you want mustard? I think you know the answer to that. Do you want a ride? Bike. That's right. I'll be in the car. I hope you remembered to practice this week. We've got a big concert tomorrow. Ladies, you already know what to wear. Gentlemen don't forget your suit jackets. Not good. I haven't practiced. Dude what are you talking about? You always practice? Sebastian, come on up here. Mr. Hardin? Mr. Hardin? Here's the script you said you'd pass along to your cousin. My cousin? Logan? Umm... Logan about that, I didn't actually think you were going to do this. I haven't really talked to my cousin in years, ever since he went into rehab. They don't allow phone cords in there. Sorry. I need to get back to my class. Sorry. Get down, what are you doing? Thanks. Tyler, you remember how Mr. Hardin said he would send my script to his cousin who worked in Hollywood... Slow down, take a breath. Start over. Mr. Hardin said he send my script to his cousin who worked in the entertainment industry. I just went to go talk to him he didn't even think I would finish it, and he didn't think it was good, and he hasn't talked to his cousin for years. Then I checked my e-mail, I had nine people reject the script. You couldn't have had that many. I counted, nine people. Just go to class and don't let it bother you. We can talk about it after school. I'll meet you by the boat. I don't even know why I came to you. Hey, little Hoffman what's up buddy? Hey everybody. This is the big film director. He's going to be making movies, yeah, action everybody. Hey, sorry dude, I just thought somebody should tell that kid what a loser he is. Mr. Hoffman. Principal Ward, lovely day is it not? What is this? I found it hanging outside someone's locker. Is your brother using the school's paper for this? No, sir, it was me. I printed them. Are you aware you used an entire ream of paper? What's a ream? 500 sheets Mr. Hoffman. My office now. 500 sheets? Logan! 500 sheets? Logan! So, how's Allison? What did I say? What's his problem? It's one of the biggest lies ever told in America... Principal Ward got on me yesterday. About your flyers. Somebody's not alive this morning. What's the point? Hi Hunny, you know what, we are not going to be able to make it to your concert tonight. We've got friends coming in from San Francisco. So we're going to be out. Where did I put? Oh. Alright, we'll be back around ten? Ten. Yeah, ten. Don't worry, we'll come to the next concert. That's what you said the last three times. Hey Ben. Hey man it's Ben. I know, that's why I just said hey Ben. Right. Are we going to go see the movie tomorrow afternoon? I don't know. Things are getting a little crazy right now. That's cool. Do you mind if Sebastian comes along? That freshman who's trying to steal my spot on drums? Why would he come? He's been hanging out with me and Carlie for the past few days. Where have I been? I don't know, where have you been? He seems pretty cool though. Don't you like him? I don't know. I got a lot to do right now. I'll call you back later. That was weird. Hey, I got to go somewhere. I'll be back later. Ok, can't you tell mom and dad? They're not here. Well I really don't care right now, ok? I've got a lot to do. Hey Logan I'm your friend and I want to help you. You don't really want to help. Yeah I do. Whatever. No one cares. What about Tyler? He cares. Yeah I'm sure he does. I want to help you. Go back to your hobbit hole or something. You can't schedule me for these hours. I already told you I can't work tonight. I have a band concert. I'm your best worker, you're... you can't fire... you know what forget it, I never even liked the place. I quit. What are you staring at? Why don't you go make a movie or something? Better yet, do some homework impress dad. I got to go. Logan where's my jacket? I don't know. Well I can't find it have you seen it anywhere? No, move. Logan, were you borrowing it? Come on, I need your help. My concert starts in ten minutes. I don't know. Last time I saw it, it was on the back of your door. Have you checked? No it's not there, do you think I'm stupid? It was laying at the edge of my bed and now its gone. You're the only person in the house... I didn't touch it. Logan this isn't funny. I'm going to be late. It's not my fault, why are you yelling at me, I told you... Because I just got fired from my job and now I'm going to be late to a concert and I just failed a math test that I stayed up all night for and didn't even study. And because of your stupid script. Stupid? It wasrt stupid! You said you liked it. Well I lied. It sucked happy? Actually it was so bad, I couldn't even finish it. You're wasting your time so just give me back my jacket. But you said it was good. Who cares what I said? It's terrible. Everything's terrible. You're only doing this for the attention anyway. What are you talking about? You said it yourself. You don't think anyone likes you, so you're going to do something cool so people will like you. And it's not won'th it. It's not true! Yes it is. It's never going to work. You're never going to finish it Logan. Quit wasting your time and focus on school. I got to go. Mom and dad will be home soon, don't go anywhere. Where have you been? Sorry. And where's your jacket? I couldn't find it. We've got a concert to do. Here's what we're going to do. You're coming in second, Sebastian get out there. What? My decision is final. Where's Logan? Logan? Ben I just want to be alone. Ok. If you need anything just call. Logan where's my jacket? Last time I saw it, it was on the back of your door. Have you checked? No do you think I'm stupid? Stupid! It wasrt stupid! You said you liked it. Well I lied. It sucked happy? I can't believe you'd do something like that Logan. Was life really that bad? Why didn't you just say something? Arert you going to offer me a ride? Nope. You got the bike. Not today. I'm riding with you. Sorry I'm late. How are you holding up? What do you mean? I'm just late because my ride never showed. No, I mean about Logan? What about Logan? You didn't hear? Hear what? He hanged himself Saturday night. What? Well someone told me he got locked up in a mental ward. What are you talking about? He killed himself. That's not what I heard. Allison, is there a problem? I have to go. Hey Hoffman How's that little butthead brother of yours doing? I think I heard he tried to hang himself. What's up with that? His little midget girl friend break up with him or... What's the matter with you? Why do you got to be such a jerk? You think you're better than him? What if that was your brother? Just keep your mouth shut. Stop making fun of people. You got me? People used to make fun of me when I was a kid. When I was little That's right, I used to be little. If you want to make fun of somebody, try making fun of me. You got it? You got it? Let me know if I can help. I heard they found him hanging from a tree. Look, I'm really sorry. Don't even! Sebastian, congratulations, you're our new drummer. Tyler, my office now. Yeah? You know darn well why I asked you in here. Because I found my brother hanging from a tree? Or because you couldn't care less? You're out Tyler. What do you mean I'm out? You had a commitment to that concert. You had a commitment and you walked out! It's lucky that Sebastian... Do you have any idea what happened Saturday night? All you care about is this stupid concert. That's not what I meant. What did you mean then? If this stupid concert hadrt happened, then all this stuff that happened to Logan wouldn't have happened in the first place. I know its hard for you to take this all in... Of course it's hard for me to take this in you jerk. Get out of here! Get out! Tyler, may I have a word with you? I know what you're going through is very rough. But that's still no excuse for assaulting a teacher. I'm afraid I have to suspend you for the week. What? Just go home and get some rest. I barely even touched the guy. Under all circumstances, I still have to maintain order so get your stuff and go home. This is stupid. Are you doing alright? I heard you got suspended. You probably shouldn't get caught out here. I'm not too worried about that right now. Is there anything I can do? What would you do if this happened to you? I guess I'd pray. Anything else? I don't know I've never been in this situation. But what happened to him? Why would he do this? What did I do to him? Tyler, it's not your fault. Yes it is. No it's not. You're right, it's not my fault. It's Mr. Spradley's fault. If that idiot wouldn't have replaced his best drummer with some kid, I wouldn't have exploded at Logan. Or if you werert replaced by Sebastian, you wouldn't have gone home during the middle of the concert. Why is this concert so important to everyone? It's not. But if you stayed the entire concert. Logan would be dead. Hello? Ben? It's Logan. Quick, call 9-1-1 The boat. Logan stay with me. Come on. It's Tyler. Come on man, I can't lose you. How do you explain that? The doctors said another two minutes and he would've been brain dead. You saved him just in time. I don't know why he would do that. I just don't know. Maybe, this is all happening for a reason. Hey wait. When do you get to go see him? Tonight. They said if everything goes well, he should be home by Thursday. Will you come with me? Hey buddy. We're here for you. Where am I? You're in the hospital. Remember? We brought you here two nights ago. Why'd you do it? Logan I'm sorry about what I said Saturday. I was stressed out. I didn't mean to blow up at you like that. I love you. I don't care what happens. You're always going to be my little brother. You're my best friend. I can't lose you. Hey sorry we're late. Dad? Hey Logan. How's it hanging? What's happening? Sorry we're late? Friends again? Ok, this is your son. You two don't know how to be parents. And then you come in his hospital room where he's laying in bed after trying to hang himself and you ask, "how's it hanging?", how stupid... Chill Tyler No you chill dad. What's wrong with you two? Tyler please. Mom, this is your son, you should care more. Of course we care, you're our kids. Then show it. Now you two can't come back in here until you've thought about how you're going to change things. Where's Logan? What happened? What's going on? Where's Logan? He's in the hospital right now. Is he ok? He'll be fine in a few days. I was so scared today. I never knew anything happened. I went to school and he wasrt there and someone told me he hanged himself. Well, he tried to. Why? I was just talking to him Friday. I know. I don't know why. I can't believe I thought he was dead. I didn't know what to do. There were so many thoughts running through my head. Hey it's alright. He'll be fine Come here. It's kind of hard to hug a hobbit. You know what? Just stop! I'm so sick of all these short jokes. Everyday I hear, "Allisors so short", "hey shortie", and your favorite, "hobbit girl"...I'm just sick of it. But I thought that... you thought I liked it? You thought I didn't care? You throught the constant making fun of me actually made me feel good? You always joke back. Only because that's all I can do. No one will stop when I say stop anyway. So what's the point? They were just jokes, I didn't mean anything by it. Yeah, but multiply that times as long as I can remember, that's a lot of jokes Tyler. And yes they do hurt. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. I know, but it would be nice if someone actually said something that made me feel good about myself. You know what? Logan had the courage to do what I could never do. And it's people like you that caused all this. You don't know how sharp words can be and how deep they can cut. I'm sorry. Whoa, you guys look different. We're on our way to the hospital. We'll be there all day if you need us. You should come by this afternoon. I will Bye hunny. Be good. Alright Logan, what's next on the list? You've got to be kidding me. What are you doing here? I need your help. Actually, Logan needs your help. You're going to get expelled. I know, but this is more important. By the way, thanks. For what? If you werert here, I would've been playing the drums Saturday night and if I were playing the drums I wouldn't have gotten to Logan until it was too late. So thanks. You're the new drummer now. Congrats! Well I... Anyway, I need you to go to my locker. The combination is 32-14-16. There's a notebook in the top shelf, I need you to talk to everyone on that list and get them in the cafeteria by noon tomorrow. What's going on? Just do it ok? I have to go 32-14-16 Tyler, hey, remember me? I'm your manager. You coming in anytime soon? I quit. Wrong! I fired you. So what are you doing here? I came because I need your help. Really? All those times I asked you for help, you were always so full of some snarky comments, remember? What do you need me for? My brother Logan needs your help. He wrote a movie about his life. All he was trying to do was tell his story and nobody would listen. What does he need me for? Now I don't do catering Logan made a list of people to be in the crew for his movie and he thought you'd make a great assistant director. What does that mean? You just have to yell at people Well I am pretty good at yelling. Yes you are. Can I make the schedule too? Sure. Hmm... alright. What does it pay? Nothing. But I can bring all the people from the movie to your coffee house. Throw in a month of free labor and you've got yourself a deal. Two weeks. Three. Fine. Hey munch... Hey Allison. Listen, I am really sorry about calling you all those names. I'll stop. I promise. And I'll get all the other people to stop too. Thanks, how's Logan? Better. Did you know he wrote a movie? Yeah. You know? Well did you know he wanted your help? Kind of, we talked about it a little. So are you in? Hey, how are you doing? You know you're not really supposed to be in here. I know but there's something that I need to do. Listen, it's Logars last night in the hospital. Do you want to come visit? Well, I've got stuff to do. I don't think I can. Like what kind of stuff? I mean it won't take that long. You just pop in and say hi. No, I've got to... I just can't. Why not? Logan would love to see you. I know, but I just can't go with you tonight. I'll drop by and see him when he gets home. Forget it. It's no big deal. I thought you were my friend but obviously... I am your friend Tyler, I just can't go. Do you want to know why I really wear long sleeves? Whoa. What happened? In the 8th grade I cut myself. A lot. I spent six months in the place like Logars in I just can't go back there. Why? I just can't. No, I mean why did you do it? Did you really want to kill yourself? I don't know if that was what I wanted. I didn't fit in. I had no friends. I wanted to be with the cool kids but I had bad acne, so they made fun of me. I wasrt smart enough for the geek group, and I wasrt a jock. I had no one. I never knew. I don't talk about it. We moved here my freshman year and I just wanted to start over. And then I met you and Ben and I finally had friends. So I just wore long sleeves and don't mention it. That's cool. I just don't think I could go to the hospital to see Logan. No I understand. Well I got to get back to class What are you doing here? I'll tell you later. How's it going? Ok. Arert you on the varsity team? Yeah, I play offensive and defensive tackle. So you're the one that beat up Gavin? You heard about that? Yeah, thanks! No one's really ever done that for me, except for Tyler. So you tried to hang yourself? Listen man I know how you felt. You felt like you're all alone and no one would listen to you. Logan when I was your age, I was short and pudgy and I hated myself. I have a sister who was short, fat, really ugly. She's still really ugly. That's not nice. No man, I love my sister, just being honest. When I was 13 I wanted out. I wanted to end it all. I just couldn't take it. I was sick of it. But I did the one thing that you didn't do. The one thing that made the difference. What's that? I told my sister about it. I told her everything. How I was going to get our dad's gun and just end it. What did she do? She told my parents. She told them everything. They called the cops. I was so mad at her. I was screaming and yelling the whole way to the hospital. I told her how much I hated her. Then what happened? After I'd been in the hospital for three days, she came up to see me. She told me, she told me to look at her. She said, "Garrett, look at me. Really look at me." She said, "I'm fat and I'm ugly but I don't care. The only way that people can get to you is if you let them." That's cool. Yeah. Listen, I got to go. But I got to tell you. Killing yourself is not the way to go. You can't take the easy way out. Just if you ever feel that self-doubt again, tell somebody. Tell somebody that you know will make the right decision. See you. Hey Mom. Hey. Who was that? He looked big. He wasrt a government agent was he? No, just a really smart friend. No, just a really smart friend. Why are you doing this? What do you mean? Exactly what I said. Why are you doing this? Well I'm your friend, why wouldn't i? I know that, but why are you really doing this? I believe that Jesus would want me to. That's a little heavy, don't you think? You asked. Wait, so you're serious? Yeah, I guess. Man, you got to rememner you're never alone there is always someone going through the exact same thing you're going through there's always someone there for you. God, he's there for you. You've been rehearsing this haven't you? A little. I should've rehearsed more, shouldn't I? No it was good! We're ready. He's here. Now! Fight, fight, fight! What's going on out here? Whoa, short sleeves. It's time to stop hiding things. Alright guys, we don't have much time, so I'm going to make this quick. Over the past few days, I've realized something that I never knew. I never knew my little brother was suicidal. And that his friend had considered it too. I also found out that one out of every three people in this room have seriously considered it. It's time we put a stop to this. Ending your life is not the answer. Why'd you really do it? Why'd you try to hang yourself? I don't know. I just thought that no one liked me no one cared. Just wanted the easy way out. We need to be there for each other. And listen when people have problems, not judge them. Why didn't you tell me how you felt? You never asked. So you don't have many friends, but the friends you do have care about you. You got to promise me something. Next time you start feeling like that tell somebody. I will. No seriously Logan tell me and if I don't listen, tell mom and dad, and if they don't listen, tell some other people. Just make sure someone hears you. I know, I promise. Logan wrote a movie and he gets out of the hospital Thursday night. Mom, I missed you. I say Friday we help him produce it. Not just for Logan, but for everyone who's ever thought of suicide. We're doing this to give them hope. We're doing this to give you hope. Have these kids gone mad? Can you get Principal Ward? I thought about checking out one time. I think we should do this. Who else is in? Open the doors. It's time to put an end to teen suicide. Who's with me? You ready for the big day? What are you talking about? You're needed on set Mr. Director. We start filming tomorrow. I read the script. I found everyone on your list. Everyone at school's going to help and we start tomorrow. Are you serious? Yeah. You're serious, right? I'm serious Logan. That's so cool. Thanks! Principal Ward. How are you doing? Wait, don't tell me. I've been expelled. Although you violated your suspension, you locked the teachers out of the cafeteria and your actions have been very extreme I'm very impressed. Everything the school has is at your disposal. I'm so happy you're alive. Yeah, I've been hearing that a lot. Listen, I'm really sorry about what I said, the whole hobbit thing. That was the least of my worries. My house is this way. Dude, you're blushing. Whoa. Come on, let's get out of here. Alright. Hey! You ready to go? Yeah. Let's go. And Action!
