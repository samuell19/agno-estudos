But these two guys here, that's the one that should be booking in the first place. Not me. - Good afternoon, gentlemen. Did you force that driver off the road? - Never seen him before in my life. - What speed were you travelling at? - About 60 kilometres an hour. What do you reckon, Bob? - We certainly weren't going any faster. - That driver maintains you were travelling a lot faster. - Not us, sarge. Otherwise you would've spotted us on the radar. - You got a licence, there? Good. All right, Kevin. How long have you had the car? - About two months. - Well, another stunt like that today and you won't have your licence or your car. All right, off you go. Consider yourself lucky this time. (car engine starts) - You were exceeding the speed limit, sir. - Yeah, I know I was. - On the radar. - But you don't believe me, because they're not there from the road and that's not fair because those people get away and I'm here getting booked. - [Officer] Sir, I'm only doing my job. - Should have booked them. - If you write a letter into the commissioner, sir, I'm sure you'll give you- - But this is not good. - How'd you get out of school? - I wrote the teacher a note. - Hope that old bag lets Anne out for lunch. - There she is. - That bitch has been on my back again. Wouldn't matter what I did. She'd still find something wrong.

He'd taken me down there for the weekend, hadn't he? (car engine revving) (horn honking) - [Bruce] Good day. - [Cheryl] Hi. - [Bruce] What you doing for lunch? - Going shopping. - How would you like the afternoon off? - Not today, I gotta go, see you later. - Care to ride tonight? - Dunno. (horn honking) (engine revving) - I'd be more careful who I was seen with at lunchtime, if I was you. Or at least take off my uniform when I was outside the store. - What do you mean? - I wouldn't like my daughter to be seen talking to those sorts of boys. - Oh, is there enough left for you? - I don't think it's any of your business, Mrs. Peg. - It is, when you're part of this staff. - I wasn't hired by you. - No, and your type wouldn't be. - what do you mean? - Ask your mother, if you can find her. - She's probably at your place doing a job on your old man. Don't let it get you down, love. - She needs to get off my back. - [Girl] Whew!

I've committed adultery in my heart many times. Mr. Carter went on to say in the interview that this is something God recognised. I've done it and God forgives me for it. - Don't drink out of the bottle, love. Other people have got to drink that, you know. - Kevin] Sorry. - And you should keep the P plates on. Your father is right, you know. - [Kevin] Yeah, right-o. - Do you want a beer? - Yes. Thanks, Dad. - Ordinary Americans found Mr. Carter's remarks in the Playboy interview offensive and unworthy of a man aspiring to the presidency. Mr. Carter, however, is still ahead of Mr. Ford in the presidential race according to latest polls. - Here you go. - Ta. - You can't go out without eating, if you're going to be drinking. - You didn't have to do that. - Don't be bloody silly. Eat it. - Thanks, Mom. - Where you going, Kev? - [Kevin] A party. - Can I come? - No. - We'll be home too late and I'm going with Bob. See you all later. - What time will you be home? - Pretty late.

Huh? - After tonight, I don't know. After what happened before, I just don't know. - What you blame it on me? You can't blame it on me, mate. You did a bit of a mistake too, didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you? - A bloke can't even have bit nowadays. - Oh. If I went and had a bit, you'd watch too, wouldn't you? Wouldn't you? - No Mate. - Don't lie to me. - I'd be sick. - Don't lie to me, Kevin. You're telling lies now. Every time I get a bit, you get a bit, don't you? - Anne, I guess, loves me. - You went slops with her, didn't you? (bottle clinks) That's just a corner. I beat you. (bottle shatters) - Jees I tell you what, mate. We're getting low on bottles. Hey, we're still mates, aren't we? You might have lost a bitch, but we're still mates, what do you reckon? - Yeah. - Yeah. - There's plenty of girls on the street, mate. Don't you think so? - But other people went off the strip. - Yeah. But what? - I get the ones I want. I like them, I like her. - You like her, do you? She wasn't that big but I like them plump. Don't you? Yes or no? - It'll take me a month to recover, for sure. - Mate, you can get another chick anywhere. You're a good looking guy, I'm not. - Forget it. - Oh, forget it. (bottle clinks) Do you want another one? - No. - You don't want another one. - I'm done, that's it. - There's only one left, mate. - No. I've had enough, I've had enough. - All right, I'll finish mine. - I'm a bit crook. - We going, are we? - [Kevin] Yeah. Come on. (hopeful piano music) Hey, get out. - [Dad] You've done it this time, Kevin. Look at the state you've got your mother in. What happened, son?
