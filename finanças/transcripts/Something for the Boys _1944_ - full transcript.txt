But the radio moves my hips and the type of music only makes it worse. - What song? - From the radio, aren't you listening? # Choo-Choo, baby, # # Don't cry baby # # Papa is going to come back some time # - The radio isn't even playing. - Of course it is! # Choo-Choo baby # I'm saying the radio is off! But I am listening with my ears and feeling in my hips. - Listen, lady ... - # Choo-Choo baby # I'm telling you that ... Come here! - She's hearing things. - Freaked out! No, it has happened before with Macy Clancy. She was a polisher and she got carborundum in her teeth. - What? - Truth! Carborundos entered the fillings ... ... and never stopped listening to radio programs! - I ask, is this radio playing? - Of course it is! # Bye-Bye, baby # # Don't cry, baby # Now what are you playing? Now the music has stopped. It's a toothpaste ad. One of us has gone crazy. Now they're talking about me, Chiquita Hart! - Huh? - They say I'm a missing heiress. Maybe a millionaire! - Come on, turn up the volume. - But it's not even connected ... "... have not yet claimed their rights." "The heirs are Blossom Hart, Harry Hart and Chiquita Hart." It saw? It's me, Chiquita Hart! I'm the missing heiress! Girls! "Whoever has information about the whereabouts of these people ..." "please contact the WOXJ station" Goodbye! DIXIELAND FLYER Southern Route Every southerner who plays solitaire is a loner. Do you agree with me? But of course, it's like talking to yourself, isn't it? Certainly. Would you accept playing a game of Acey Deucey? Acey Deucey? Ah, yes, we played it at home, betting chopsticks, of course. - Do not say! - Yea. Do you accept a low bet? Just to stay sharp. - Well, all right. - Shuffle. - Waiter, two mint juleps. - Yes sir. Let's see ... Said Acey Deucey, didn't you? CORONEL JEFFERSON L. CALHOUN Lawyer Hello. You can tell Colonel Calhoun that I have arrived. I'm Blossom Hart. Ah, you're Blossom Hart. Cel. Calhoun went out to lunch, baby. - Well, I hope. - Very well. Tell me, what is Uncle Louie's farm like? It is a historical heritage, isn't it? The only historical heritage I remember is Camp Dixon. - Wow, those precious soldiers! - By the way, have my cousins ​​arrived yet? I couldn't say. I started working here yesterday and I'm leaving tomorrow. I received a better proposal from a sergeant. Let's get married... ... as soon as we find where to live. - Are you a secretary? - Uh-huh. Pleasure. You can announce me. Sou Chiquita Hart, from Terre Haute, Indiana. Chiquita Hart? Are you Chiquita? - I'm your cousin Blossom, how are you? - Do not say! What a pleasure to meet you! You know, I thought you would be a pain. But you are very, very cool! And you too, press. Come on, give me a hug! But Chiquita, how did you get into the family tree? This tree story is kind of complicated, but I'll summarize it for you. My mother's name is Maria Carmenzinha Margarida Lopes, from Brazil. But my dad is Jake Hart, from Terre Haute, Indiana, a traveling salesman. - You must have traveled a lot, huh? - Sure. It traveled all over South America. It made my mother sway, blush, surrender, and that's why my name is Chiquita. Bingo! # I'm always doing something # # Something for the boys # What a good song on the radio. It looks like a Rock Fulton orchestra. - Are you listening to anything on the radio? - Clear. Turn up the volume! Volume up? - How did you know? - Ah! # I'm glad I came from Dixie # # Hurrah, hurrah # Good Morning! My card, sweetie. Can you turn it off? I want to speak to Colonel Calhoun immediately. I'm sorry, he went out to lunch. You will have to wait. Now look, and I still have an urgent appointment. But God be praised! Ladies! Allow me to introduce myself. Colonel Harry Hart of Magnolia Manor. - Harry Hart? - Magnolia Manor? Yes, madam, one of the largest southern farms. Four thousand bushels of fertile land spouting peanuts, popcorn ... ... and oil wells. How are you? - How did he get on the tree? - They must have been dropped at the door. Oh my God! The south of my heart! Those mint juleps, racing ponies, and black culture. The only place in the world where ... you can grow cotton. On top of that I am single, and all this just for me. - Only for you? - Virtually. Just settle some details with the inventor, Colonel Calhoun. Here among us, there are two smarties out there to take advantage of. But I hired Calhoun to prove that Uncle Louie was also single ... soon I couldn't have cousins. I may even require blood tests. Blood can be strong, but not as much as oil wells, that's not it! Colonel Calhoun, these are Mr. Hart's heirs . Now now! I see that the cousins ​​have already met. Cousins? Nice to meet you. Well, I'm afraid they'll have to do some work. He could take advantage of the doors and build a house around it. Ah, welcome to the sanctuary. It is still an imposing house. Must be at least 125 years old. But how could you get so old in 125 years? Or so dirty. Yes, but the glorious tradition still exists. This is the great chandelier from which his great-great-grandfather Thaddeus hanged himself. It looks like it's still there. And this is a grand hall. Noble hall? Ah, if this hall could speak. You can imagine the gala parties, ... the music and the joy, the graceful minuets ... ... and one of his ancestors holding a mint julep in his hand ... ... leaning gracefully against this column ... Okay, Colonel, but ten is the limit. C'mon C'mon. Forget the past. The only way to fully appreciate this salon ... it is seeing it invaded by the sunlight. Good idea. It's the only thing Uncle Louie left us ... and that it was not eaten by termites. The sunshine! - There is a lot of desire to die! - I'm afraid it needs repair too. But a good hand of paint, wallpaper, plumbing, roof, all new ... And lots of new money! I don't know about you, but I'm hard. I spent my last penny on new clothes and the bus ticket. Colonel, in addition to this loft and 16,000 acres of fresh air ... ... the will did not mention anything greenbacks, do you know, money, money bills? - Money, money, currency. - Oh yes of course. Well, it's all here, ready to sign. Taxes, loans, debts, court fees, court fees, judicial fees! - Any balance? - Uh, no balance. - No balance - No balance. - But fees are left over. - Naturally. But think of the priceless value of the property you inherited. So, unless you have more questions, I say goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Priceless property. Because I would sell my share ... Hey, Colonel! You are right, it is an invaluable property . Think of tradition. The oldest historical heritage in the state. - Who wouldn't be proud to own it? - Certainly! Imagine who else might be buried here besides Uncle Louis. Imagine just having mint juleps on your own balcony. It is true. Imagine just enjoying a bourbon in front of these serene fields. Look, everything is golden. And under that gold, what? - Who will know? - Liquid gold! Petroleum! I can even smell it. Imagine oil spouting in your own garden. You just have to dig a hole and the fumes are all smeared. - You may be right. - There's no mistake. It is a unique chance. Two thousand measly barrels will give you two million dollars! Do you want to pass on all these encumbrances? Are you recording? Think of royalties, Colonel. You'll get more money out of here than your customers. - It's not just that ... - It is! Get your hands off me! - Colonel Calhoun? - Yea. We were looking for him. We called your office and said you would be here. And then? Sergeant Green wants to submit a proposal for the house. You can talk to the new owner. Yeah, they'll have to talk to the new owner. It's me! What a disappointment! I think I'm going to play a southern maiden and throw myself into the river. I'm the one who's cold, Chiquita. Worse than me, I eat only one acrobat in the family. Come on in, sir. Just go over the fallen door. I know it looks kind of poorly maintained ... ... but you will love Magnolia Manor. Everything here smells of tradition ... Whoa! And these are my two cousins. Two beautiful shoots of this lovely south of ours. How are you? The gentleman wants to take a look at the house. It's quite a home. It is not our fault. Our uncle died and left it to us. Only then did he manage to get rid of her. Hey! Yes, the place is ideal. Just hit the wood and the termites come out to greet you. Girls, control yourself! The gentleman wants to make us an offer, doesn't he, sergeant? - That's right. - Cash? How much? Do you really want to buy it? Not quite. I represent a group of married men from the base ... ... looking for a place to stay with their wives. - Of course. - Of course! Naturally. And hotels are crowded. But the other day we passed by during the preparations for the maneuvers ... - Maneuvers? - Yes, war games. Colonel Calhoun authorized us to use the area. As soon as we saw the house we thought about transforming it ... ... in a center for military women Good idea. Who knows, I may also become a military woman? Well, by the way you closed a deal. How about $ 20,000 ... We don't want to buy, just rent. Don't you want to help the boys? Sure, but what woman would like to live in this rubble? I understand. The house really needs a general. You're right. But we don't have the money. Do not worry about this. The boys would contribute. - With labor too. - You didn't tell me your name, soldier. - Rocky Fulton. - Rocky? Rocky Fulton! Our! The face printed on all the juke boxes. I've heard you thousands of times on the radio. I love your ... I mean, I'm a singer and I'm crazy about your orchestra. - Do you sing? - Hm-hmm. - What do you know? - All the discs you have already recorded. I've been trying a test with you for two years . I was never lucky. Listen, if the boys get the house, I'll be here every night. There will be tests in bulk. If you want, the boys can keep the house. Done deal. - You know what? - Hm-hmm. Something tells me that I'm going to spend a lot of time here. - What will your wife say? - Nothing. I mean ... it's just that I'm not married. I'm doing this for the guys. - I understand. - And you know what? For all your kindness, I think I'll take the test right now. Let's go. Rocky, great! But how are you going to use a vocalist in the army? Who said anything about the army? This war will not last forever. We need to think about the future. Don't look at me like that. I swear I end up kissing you. It's just a test, Rocky.

For me, that was fate. It was just to start looking for a house to live in after we were married ... ... and those people appear in the office where I was working. I've never seen such luck. And with you living so close to the base ... instead of the canteen you can cook for me. Baby, you know I'm a disgrace in the kitchen. I don't even know how to boil water. It's making me feel like ... Well, we're not going to eat much anyway. Yahoo! - Harry! Do you want to stop it? - What are you doing? Just in time to see my latest invention. You'll love. My wash cloth, bottle washer and automatic shampoo. How about, huh? And look at that. A normal dishwasher. Normal even. But with a special touch by Harry Hart just call and ... Harry, turn it off! Hang up, Harry! My goodness! I must have forgotten some repair. For God's sake, Harry, stop making things better. This kitchen is becoming a threat. This is turning into a madhouse. And this mixer for washing hair leaves your hair a mess! She's right! Girls, we are in the scientific age. We have to save manpower. When you're done, just push a button. There I invent the button that presses the button. When everything is working you will love me. I'm going to love you like poison if you don't stop playing that radio everywhere. - Who's playing the radio? - You! - I didn't sleep a wink last night! - I didn't hear any radio. Didn't you hear? Shhh! It's playing now! Bird sheets! # When the birds got no peeps # # When he jump without the chips # # When he don't go tweet tweet tweet # # Give him Lambsby Worm bird sheets # She's hearing things! - She has tubes inside the turban. - You should see a doctor. Doctor? You should see an electrician. Chiqui. Chiqui. Has your mother ever had a scare with short waves? Do you hear anything now? - Promotion, promotion, promotion ... - Uh-huuu! What time do you have to go back to base, baby? - In about 20 minutes. - Damn it! Why are you second lieutenant? Then he would own his nose. Is it ... uh? It was a great idea to fix this house. Now married men will have a place to spend their nights. - Just married? - Tell me something. How do you explain that you never won an engagement ring? Well, I never threatened anyone to stop it from happening. Can not understand. I bet you know how to cook, wash dishes and everything. To be honest I never tried. Ever since I can remember I was born behind the scenes of the theater. Me too. Since I found a clarinet on the head of my music teacher ... and ran away with a carnival band. Have you ever stayed up at night on a train ... watching the lights of the houses fly by ... ... when crossing a small country town ? Hm-hmm. When all you know is random encounters, second-class hotels and boarding houses ... ... the person begins to dream of having a house of his own. IT IS. You start thinking about going home for dinner ... ... with the woman and the children. We start thinking about these things when we don't have them. That's why it's so fun to prepare this house for the boys. It makes us look like other people, happy. - It's like having a home. - IT IS. # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # I wish that I could stay # # And hold you tight # # I wish, I wish, I wish # # By every star above # # That we could linger long enough # # To fall in love # # I'd hate to be the one to break away # # When I've a heart # # That you could take away # # I hate to miss the kisses # # That your lips invite # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # Look at that moon beaming out loud # # He knows that I'm dreaming out loud # # He sort of seems to say # # The time is right # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # Why should we say good night # # When every star is shining bright? # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # I wish that I could stay # # And hold you tight # # I wish, I wish, I wish # # By every star above # # That we could linger long enough # # To fall in love # Rocky, I had an idea. Why don't we think before? I've worked in show business, so have you. - Some of the boys and the women ditto. - AND? We can put on a show to help pay the bills. Blossom, you are wonderful. It's already in the chat, just settle with the army! - Do you think you can do it? - Looking at me like that I do anything. And if I continue I will end up kissing you. So kiss. I help. # Look at that moon beaming out loud # # Beaming out loud # # He knows that I'm dreaming out loud # # Knows that I'm dreaming out loud # # He sort of seems to say # # The time is right # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night #. # Good night # # Good night # # Good night # # Why must we say good night? # # Good night # Very well, girls. You were wonderful. Ah, Rocky looks awful. Let's try again. You are demanding too much of them. They will be exhausted. There are only 4 hours left for the debut soon. Now remember, the next time you dance it will be for the customers, did you say? Give it your all and good luck. Don't worry, everything will be fine. I need to go to the base but I'll be back in time, right? - Until later. - Okay, Rocky. Okay, work done. Wow, I lost my breath! Are you one of the new military wives ? Not yet, but soon, I hope. Where can I find Sergeant Rocky Fulton? - Ah, he's around. - Pay the driver, boy. - Are you one of the maids? - Maids? Come up with my bags and pack my clothes. Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky, querido! Oh my love! - Aren't you surprised to see me? - Oh yes of course... How did you get here? I mean, how are you? I am exhausted. You can't imagine what horror it is to travel! - Well, let's go out, how about? - To go out? What you mean? - Listen, Melanie ... - I don't want to listen, I want to stay here ... Yes, but ... It screwed! - What dear? - Nothing, nothing. Why are you so elusive? - Listen, Melanie, I need ... - I heard about everything. So this is your project for military women. - Yes, yes ... What? - I passed the base. Lieutenant Carruthers, what a sympathy! He told me everything. - How you did it just for me ... - Yes ... No, wait, Melanie! - I want to introduce you ... - I see you have many possibilities. But it deserves a person with more taste. I take care of that. Ah, is it your housekeeper? Housekeeper? This is Blossom Hart, the owner of the house, that's all! Do not say! Anyway, you must understand that ... since i'm going to live here, i'll make some changes. Oh yes? - Listen, honey, I ... - Yes, honey? Melanie, don't start dismantling the organization. Miss. Hart broke his head to lift it and ... But for your project to work it needs organization. And I've always been an organizer. But don't think that I intend to replace you, dear. Oh no. And also don't think you will replace me ... dear. We will do what we can. I hope I can contribute minimally so that we are successful, of course. - And if there's no money ... - Oh, that's very kind. But we hope that our show will give to finance the project. Ah yes, Lieutenant Carruthers told me. And I thought it was fantastic, Rocky. I can help with that too. Dad must have good contacts in the city, I would move here ... - Ah, yes, who is your Commander? - Uh ... It must be some colonel or general who knows Dad. I'll talk to him and ... Let me see ... Melanie, for your information, this business is only for the military. Why, dear, you are so inefficient. Leave everything to me. Today I will help as a receptionist ... I have a stunning dress. Where's my room, heart? Well, if it’s going to happen here, heart ... ... it's the first room on the right at the end of the hall up there. Well, I think I can manage. After all, we're at war, aren't we? Don't go, Rocky. You have a lot to do. Blossom... - Oh, listen, dear. - Why didn't you tell me? But I didn't even know she was going to come here. - Are you engaged to her? - Well, you know how it is ... I met her before joining the army. The orchestra was called to play in Baltimore at a debutante ball. You are just a liar. I never want to see you again! Blossom, wait! So, make up your mind! Can't you walk without bumping into a man? Now, stop being cool! Okay, guys, for those who do not have a ticket, the ticket office is right here. Millions have fun with our show ... for the ridiculously modest amount of $ 2. Beautiful and graceful women ... ... in a musical extravaganza sparkling and pulsating ... ... with joy, melodies, youth and songs. - Do you already have your tickets? - Yea. If you want to test your luck, it 's up there on the right, you know? That's it, guys, you'll see Master Rocky Fulton and his dixieland orchestra. I'm glad you came, Colonel. Thank you, Miss. Walker. The privilege is all mine to support any business ... ... sponsored by the daughter of my old friend Calvin Walker. Miss. Walker plans to expand the house to accommodate wives of recruits. He thinks that with his recommendation it would make things easier. I will be happy to cooperate. Lieutenant, arrange for a site inspection tomorrow. - Thank you sir. - But how nice, Colonel. It will be a pleasure. I tried to speak but she doesn't even want to know about me. Rocky, how would you feel in your place ... ... being treated like a disposable fret just because another woman appears? But I didn't know Melanie would come. The reform had nothing to do with it. But if Blossom doesn't want to believe it, what am I going to do? Crawl behind her until ... - It's show time. - Rocky ... After the storm the calm always comes. - Uh ... I don't understand. - Everything will be okay! - Hope so. Good luck, Chiqui. - Good luck, Rocky. Hi harry! Easy, easy, otherwise our reputation will go down with the army. Come on, guys. Everyone has the fun they deserve. Down there they have theirs, Here we have ours. # 8:19 you leave Atlanta Station # # 8:48 you're in Forest Park # # Lovejoy, Sunnyside # # Orchardville and Barnsville # # One more stop and you got to walk # # But 80 miles outside of Atlanta # # They live in a lazy kind of way # # But 80 miles outside of Atlanta # # Ga. # # The folks who meet you # # The people who greet you # # They sort of politely swing and sway # # But 80 miles outside of Atlanta # # Ga. # # They got doors that never # # Had any lock in # # All they got they're perfectly # # Willing to share # # They can hear old opportunity knocking # # While they're rocking themselves to sleep # # In that old rocking chair # # They never worry # # They ain't in a hurry # # Because they know they're gonna stay # # But 80 miles outside of Atlanta # # Ga. # # G-E-O-R-G-I-A # #Atlanta, Ga. # # How do you get there? # # You take the 8:19 # # Where do you get off? # # Eighty miles from Atlanta # # How is the ride there? # # Like a rocking chair # # They never worry # # They never hurry # # They know they're gonna stay # # But 80 miles outside of Atlanta # # Ga. # #Atlanta, Ga. # # I'm in the middle of nowhere # # I'm in betwixt and between # # Dark is the starlight above me # # Never knowing you loved me # # I go drifting from dream to dream # # And so, if I wind up with no one # # How can I help but be blue? # # I'm in the middle of nowhere # # 'Cos I'm getting nowhere with you # # I'm in the middle of nowhere # # I'm in betwixt and between # # Dark is the starlight above me # # Never knowing you loved me # # I go drifting from dream to dream # # And so, if I wind up with no one # # How can I help but be blue? # # I'm in the middle # # Of nowhere # # 'Cos I'm # # Getting nowhere # # With you # Hey, it's clear day!

See if you can get the money. We'll be back tomorrow. And thank you very much. - It was a great night. - Worse was waking up in the morning. - I haven't tapped so much in five years! - But it was worth it, it was a success! And what an audience! I need to get glamorous. I will find my husband. Me too. - Can you lend me your rouge? - Sure, let's go. Honey, you barely touched the food. Ah, I don't eat a lot in the morning. Listen, Blossom, why are you going to let this Melanie stay with Rocky if you want him too? If that's what he wants, you can have it. I will not run after anyone. I do not understand. Rocky says he doesn't run after you, you say he doesn't run after him. Who will catch who? - Good Morning. - Good morning, Miss. Walker. - It's ten o'clock. - Have you had coffee yet? Ah, we forgot to speak. When you want coffee in bed ... - ... just call Blossom. - No need to worry. I'm glad they're done. I'm waiting for a guest - Guest? - Yes, any problem? Oh, no, no, no. There is no restaurant service here? The best! But it's basically a canteen. Too bad. We have to do something about it. Despite the disorganization of this institute for military women ... hoped to make a good impression on Lieutenant Carruthers. - Ah, Lieutenant Carruthers. - Isn't the guest Rocky? Well, if I'm supposed to be a cook and a maid, could you show me the kitchen? The kitchen? Ah, you will love the kitchen. Harry made everything in there work, which is wonderful! And we're going to help you make a good impression on Lieutenant Carruthers. Please join us. - So this is the kitchen. - Not beautiful? Hm, I don't see anything special. But this is very special. Sure. And who knows, maybe the lieutenant wants a cup of coffee? It is true. Do you have an electric coffee maker? No, just old kettles. But we have a great mixer, if you want some scrambled eggs. It works? It's fabulous! You will see. Are you sure you know how to make them light and soft? No, but the mixer does. I better do it. So I'll be sure it will be fine. - Push the button. - Thank you, I know how to do it. - Ready. Now the toast. Where's the bread? Uh ... logo ali. - Are they already well beaten? - No, but I am. Make the toast. Very dry. And you, uh ... ... set the table. Wow, it's too slow ... Turns off! Turn that off! Look, I'm all smeared! The blender is not to blame. Water, water, give me some water! Take me to the sink, don't just stand there! Ready. Now just stand there. Turns off! Turns off! Hang up, for God's sake! He did it on purpose! Made Yes. And the mixer too! Srta. Walker! They want to kill me. This is what you want. - Oh, Ashley, help me! - What is it, what happened? - Take me out of here. They want to kill me. - Who, Miss. Walker, who? They ... these two vultures! I was preparing the house for inspection and they attacked me. Look at me! Honey, if I didn't attack you before, the mistake was mine. I will end this woman. Ashley, don't let them touch me. Why not inspect this horrible house and find out what ... Ashley, look at that! We hope. I told you to use the back stairs! You, come down here. - What are they doing here? - I do not know. - They don't have women here. - What are you talking about? Lieutenant Carruthers, before you jump to conclusions, I ... Please, they're all military, I'll take care of it. I can explain everything in two minutes. - Don't listen, Ashley! - Please. From one southerner to the next, we know that man is man and ... ... if you can't bet on horses ... - Williams, do you have a wife here? - Well I... - Of course not, what nonsense. - Peterson, you're not married, are you? No sir. Are any of you married to a wife residing here? No, but they have complete freedom. Look, Lieutenant ... It's just what I wanted to know. Go back to the base. They're stuck. Yes sir. Lieutenant, you're making a big mistake. I can explain... I've heard what I had to hear. Whatever you have to say, tell Cel. Grubbs after I gave you my report. I will recommend that this house be banned. Get me out of here, Ashley. I'll never set foot here again! With pleasure. If you don't mind the jeep, I can take it. Thank you, Ashley. I'll have my bags picked up. And I hope the army will expel you from here. - I'm the one who will throw you out. - You wouldn't dare. Oh no? THIS PLACE KNOWN AS MAGNOLIA MANORS IS DISCONTINUED FOR MILITARY BY ORDER OF CORONEL GRUBBS - I better pack my bags too. - I don't take your reason. Does it make sense to stay here if your husband can't get in? - It's like we're single. - Where are you staying, dear? It doesn't matter if it's on a park bench. I want more is to be with him. It is more likely to sing again in any hole. Girls! Girls! I already know! Chiqui, when you worked at the factory, you used to deal with carborundos, didn't you? Of course, used for polishing. That's right! I knew I had read it somewhere! It's here at Reader's Digest. A guy who worked in the same place, had carborundum on his teeth ... ... and turned into a TV set. He watched soap operas in the morning, advertisements at lunch freshman shows every night. What are you listening to now? Nothing. When I eat grapefruits I don't hear any radio. Don't touch that! Acidity interrupts transmission. But only then can I sleep! He still talks about sleeping when I had the best idea of ​​the century. - It's fantastic, it's colossal! - Why, dear? I'm going to invent something so that people can walk with their own television on a tooth. - Harry, you have gone crazy. - That's what they said about Marconi! It is the biggest scientific discovery since toothpaste. Worth millions, billions. Our problems are gone. Sure, sure, sure. But even if he invented a doormat that sang "Welcome, Solitary Soldier" ... ... the house would remain closed. Now, Blossom, we would have generals and admirals fighting to get in here. Do you know what this means for the armed forces? Any pilot, soldier or sailor can have his TV inside a filling. What is that? It seems that the maneuvers have started. - Maneuvers? As well? - Maneuvers, war games. The same as a real war, but without real bullets ... I hope The boys are divided into two sides. The blue army against the red. Ah, blue and red. These Russians don't stop quiet, do they? Hey, since you're here, we can tell you about the carborundum. Good idea. Come on, Chiqui, I'm going to prepare you for a demonstration. - Wait here, I'll be right back. - Right, sergeant. - Hey, Rocky! - Get out, I have an official friend here. Can not. We received message from HQ. The reds are advancing. We have to get out of here and go to Jackson's Creek. Jackson's Creek? Ask for more information on the radio and leave a jeep there for me. But be careful, Rock. You know what happens if they catch you. - Goodbye to the patent. - Big Deal. Blossom! Come on, be nice. Give me a chance. I have to get out of here. Okay, I'm not worth anything. But at least open that door so we can talk. Excellent! But if I opened the door, it might even hit me. It wasn't meant to be taken literally! Listen, Blossom, it's the opportunity that knocks on your door. If you do not want... Okay, this will be our command post. Make way. Get those furniture out of there. Set the tables against the wall. All appliances in operation. Everyone is on the alert stage. We found a blue force jeep. They must have left a spy here. - Search the house. - Yes sir. Watch out for traps. - Surround the perimeter so it doesn't escape. - Yes sir. Come on, follow me. There you go, stop. It's captured. Okay, I'm captured. Scott reports that the blue forces are withdrawing to the south. They left the trailer field and occupied the Kentucky Dew Distillery. Communicate with the "C" troop commander . Inform us that our artillery will occupy Jackson's junction. - Yes sir. - Spy captured, sir. - Refuses to speak. - Inform Intelligence. What were you looking for here, Sergeant Fulton? Won't talk, huh? Take him inside. You will be confined in this room and do not leave. You're under arrest, sergeant. It is suspended from the operation. Guard can withdraw. If you don't mind, banned or not, the house is mine ... ... and he has nothing to do with it. I'm sorry, but these are war maneuvers. The army has decided to occupy your home and I am in command. The prisoner will stay where he is. Listen, you little lead soldier, you 've caused me enough trouble. Get him out of here or I'll lose my mind! I'm sorry, ma'am, I have no time to waste. Ah, Harry, later. I want to see soldiers playing war. To play? If this works, we will win wars. Open mouth. Most. Most! - Did you see a box of nails out there? - Not here. - Thanks. - Hold on. Let me adjust ... that. Ready. What are you listening to? - Anything I ate? - No. This is static, it's good. Just take it out and you become a speaker! Let me adjust. No, this does not do. I'll get a file. Stay there, I'll be right back. Ah, Harry, Harry ... " What did you do to me?" #Take your hands off me, you bastard! " May I spend the rest of my life stuck on bread and water if I'm lying! Listen, if you get out of there again ... I call the Red Army by weight and say that it attacked me. He spoke, he spoke. I will hang myself with my laces. Blossom, Blossom, look ... What are you doing here, Rocky? Hi, Chiqui. They managed to catch me. But now it's her cousin who started her war. - Why are you fighting with Rocky? - For what he revealed. "And I believed you, I loved you, you ..." - Hey, wait ... - Go back to your place! It's okay that you don't believe me, but look how you speak. "I thought I could trust you, but you 're a bastard!" - Hey, stop it! - I'm not talking with you. So do not speak! "Never talk to me like that again , you ..." - Hey, what was that shooting? - Hey, what does that mean? I don't regret what I did. That woman will not take you away from me. Chiqui, it worked. The sound is perfect. - Who's crazy here? - I'm a genius! My invention turns people into transmission devices. Can be anyone. Army and Navy can use. - Show them. - Look. - A plate of carborundum on the tooth. - Shows how it works. Come on, tune in. Got? Don't lose my connection! This is Western Union. Take something cool! Shhh! It's my posting code. Let's go over there so the reds wo n't hear us. What are they saying? The blue HQ ordered my detachment to attack from the north. This is bad? Yes, but if the attack focuses on Magnolia Manor ... they could capture the Red Army personnel by weight . Can't contact them? If I had I would solve everything. Your home would be dismantled and I would save my patent. Only now I'm a prisoner of war. Do not worry. Ethics is not my thing. - Where is the blue HQ? - Clear! Harry can go and warn them. No way. The reds would catch him before he even hit the road. There has to be a way. What do we do? "Tune in to this station at 8:30 for more information." Chiqui, it's out of frequency. Disconnect that. - Chiqui! - I? I can not do anything. Yes you can. If you can receive you can also send. - I send? - Nonsense! How will she transmit? Did you forget I'm an inventor? Yes, we remember! Leave it there. Come on, come with me. There, Chiqui. I finished the grounding. Come on, hold the tubes up. This! - I am scared. - But, Chiqui, we have to try it. - I hope you know what you're doing. - Are you sure it's safe? As if I could risk a hair from Chiqui! Very well. Now let's call. Come on, steady! Harry! Harry! Please! - Turn it off! - Harry, Harry ... What happened? - Can not understand. - There's a loose thread here. Of course! A short circuit. Repair in no time. - Let's try again. - No I do not want! - But we need it, dear. - No, no, I'm scared! Please, Chiquita. You have to try again. It's all up to you. I promise it works this time. - Okay, but no short circuit! - As soon as you speak. Come on. Do not be nervous. Great ... don't be scared Calm ... calm! Epa ... epa ...! - It saw? It worked! - Are you okay, Chiquita? It is hard to shock me. How about, huh? Give me that code. Even if it works, I can't believe it. Well, let's go. Call ... to ... HQ. Hey, listen to this. Call... ... to ... HQ. - What is it, static? - Whatever it is is decipherable. It's our code. Take the key. Can't you send short messages? Bad spelling, but it makes sense. See if they are trying to communicate with us. With so much baticum it is better that they respond. We will try. Now put that plaque on the tooth. "Figaro!" "Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro ..." Chiquita, you're out of frequency, adjust that. Hey, they're getting it! It works! Chiqui, you're in the air! You will win a medal for that! As long as it's not meant to stick to the tooth! Harry, say that the red team is here. Have Magnolia Manor attacked. Okay, come on. It says the red ones are parked south of here ... na Magnolia Manor. - Have you verified the sender's identity? - Identity confirmed, sir. The codes sent check. In that case, we will take the red team by surprise. We will divert the main attack south. - Tonight at 20:30. Send the message. - Yes sir. Right. Now let's hear what they said. "Make way for the factotum of the city! Make way for the factotum of the city!" "Of the city, of ..." Come on, adjust it right. - They're going to attack. - See? - Shhh! Someone is coming. - Take it off, Chiquita. - Come on, take it off fast! - Arrested! - Give me the pliers !. - Quick, do something! - Nice day, isn't it? - Hey, what's going on here? - It's her sinusitis. - Sinusitis? It is the only thing that improves. Isn't it, Chiqui? Uh-huh. I still think I heard some weird beats here. Ah, that! That's it. - It's part of the treatment. - Before you continue with sinusitis. - Well, sorry to interrupt. - All right. - If you need any treatment ... - No, thanks. Hey, if you have any belongings out there, you better collect. The detachment is already leaving. You heard what he said. The army is leaving. What will my commander say if he arrives and the reds are gone? Even worse because I was the one who sent them to come. - There we go again. - What are you going to do, Harry? - Tell the blues that it was a rumor. - Wait. Can't you keep them here until the blues arrive? Good idea, but how? - Guys, it's easy! - Only if it's for you. No, no, it's easy! Easy! Chiquita is right! In love and war anything goes. Let's go soft on the reds and the girls will have their husbands back today. Hey, good idea! Will be? Let's tell the girls. - Let me see that, Chiquita. - Hey, Blossom, wait! Do you have a cold? - No, it's my sinusitis. - Oh well... - More peas, Lieutenant? - Ah, thank you very much. I must admit that I made a mistake in sending my report ... asking for the ban on your home. Now, Lieutenant! I never imagined how charming you are! I don't know how to describe this unexpected pleasure. But where would our southern hospitality be, especially when it comes to you? You know, I have a weakness for well-caught soldiers. Now, Srta. Hart! - More peas, Lieutenant? - No thank you very much. "More peas, Lieutenant?" "More peas, Lieutenant!" What was this? Our prisoner trying to eat the wood from the windows. After all, he also deserves to eat. I completely forgot about him. I remember that when I joined, I only thought about meals. - I think it's better ... - Don't worry, I'll take care of him. Thanks. - Harry! - I'm going. How are you? - Everything up, cousin? An expression that we use in the north. Can you take this to Sergeant Fulton, please? It seems that the ration has been rationed. You know, Ashley, no matter how much I do it will always be little for you. - More peas? - No thank you. - Here, your dinner. - Bread and water, wonderful! You can return it. Say I already hunger by biting my nails. What it is? Everything is working out. You have nothing to worry about. Nothing, just watching her curl up in that meganha as if she were going to drown. Now, she doesn't like him. Nonsense of yours! Yeah, nonsense, a lot of nonsense ... How about, now you're wiping his chin like a napkin. And? The sauce is greasy. Who's going to kiss a smeared chin? Furthermore, she is doing it for you. Well, you don't have to. I pass. Excellent! Now she hugged him. Control yourself! It will ruin everything! - Do you mind? - No, you can help yourself. I thank. "More peas, Lieutenant?" - There's something else I'm sorry about. - What, Ashley? I had to leave early on your show and I couldn't hear you singing. - I don't think he lost much. - That's not what I was told. But how nice! What a shame, more precise to fire me. - That's it! - This what? My best song. That's her title. - Sit down, I sing now. - But it's ok. # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # I wish that I could stay # # And hold you tight # # I wish, I wish, I wish # # By every star up above # # That we could linger long enough # # To fall in love # # I'd hate to be the one # # To break away # # When I've a heart # # That you could take away # # I'd hate to miss the kisses # # That your lips invite # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # Look at that moon # # Beaming out loud # # He knows that I'm dreaming out loud # # He sort of seems to say # # The time is right # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # # I wish we didn't have # # To say good night # Chiqui, where's the blue army? They are passing through the farms on the other side of the city. Stud, eh? Why don't you hurry up. They were supposed to arrive in four minutes. Ladies, I don't know how to thank you for your hospitality. But unfortunately, we have to leave. But Lieutenant, you can't go anytime soon! We were supposed to be at Jackson's junction an hour ago. I'm sorry, but... - Sirs! Sirs! Where are you going? - Let's go north. North? But don't you know where they are? We are in the south. Don't you know what the south means? Do not know? What does it mean, sir? # Southland! # Hm, an orchestra! # Southland! # # I love the dear old Southland # # I wish I was in the land of cotton # # Old times there are not forgotten # # Look away, look away, # # Look away, look away # # I gotta shoes, you gotta shoes # # She's gotta shoes, he's gotta shoes # # I gotta shoes, I gotta shoes # # I gotta shoes, I gotta shoes # Hey, where did you get so many coupons? # I gotta shoes, I gotta shoes # Chiqui. Why are you late? They are not late. They're passing in front of David's Delicatessen now. David's Delicatessen? Excellent. I just hope they don't stop for a snack. Friend, there are many songs ... ... but the one I like the most is the southern one. I know there is South America, South Dakota, South Brooklyn ... ...South Africa! # Awesome, yugula # # I'm proud of you # # Young young legal # # Glowee! # # Alaga gunta gala # # Uga uga # # Chatanooga chooga # # Chatanooga chooga, yes! # # Yes, skin skin # # Young young long long # Sirs!

The place is completely surrounded and neutralized by the blue forces. What's going on here? They will be penalized for this transgression. Report to your commander immediately . Não, não, preciso ir. Força azul... O que faz aqui, Sargento? Eu, eu... Eu fui capturado, senhor. Teve alguma coisa a ver com a desarticulação das forças vermelhas? Sim, senhor... não, senhor... quer dizer... Não tive nada a ver com isso. Foram as meninas que confundiram os vermelhos. É que seus maridos são da força azul, assim elas torciam pelo nosso lado... ...pra poder trazê-los de volta. Que história é essa de desorganizar manobras de guerra? - Já não interditei esta casa? - Sim, mas foi tudo um mal-entendido. A Srta. Hart ofereceu a casa para esposas de militares... - ...para poder ajudar os rapazes... - Basta, soldado. Apresente-se à sua tropa. Sim, senhor. Esposas, hein? - Você é casada? - Sim, com o Soldado Murphy, senhor. - Com quem você é casada? - Sargento Laddie Green, um doce de pessoa! - Oh, isto é... - E você? Ducky Smith, isto é Soldado Smith. - Eu? Não. - Então o que está fazendo aqui? Bem, eu tinha meus planos. Interditado, hein? Terei que dar um jeito nisso. Quem é você? O que quer? O que é isso no rosto? - Eu, uh... Posso explicar, Coronel. - Deixe que eu explico. É muito simples. Eu posso dar todas as explicações sem haver confusão nenhuma. O senhor está vendo aquele rapaz de óculos com a boca pintada de preto? Dizem por aí que ele é meu primo. Pode ser, pode não ser. Eu acredito. Meu nome é Maria Carmenzinha Margarida Lopes, do Brasil. - Ah, Brasil? - Sim, Brasil, Brasil! Mas o nome do meu pai é Jake Hart... ...de Terre Haute, Indiana, vendedor itinerante. Vendedor itinerante? Hm-hmm. Em bom português, caixeiro viajante. Como o senhor vê, uma confusão tão grande que ninguém se entende mais. É melhor por um stop nisso e neca, neca! - Ora, que interessante! - Está vendo? - Interditado, hein? Vou estudar o caso. - Okay! Chiqui, você resolveu tudo. O que você falou? Disse que você é maluco! Descansar! FESTA LIBERADA Diversão sem limites na Magnolia Manor Harry. - Olá, prima. - Já encontrou o Rocky? Ainda estou procurando. Mas fica fria, ele acaba aparecendo. Claro que também pode ter pegado 20 anos de cadeia, mas é o tipo de cara que esperaria eternamente. Não sei se vai dar pra esperar o Tenente. Se tiver algum compromisso, não será o exército que o fará se atrasar. - Onde já se viu? - Tá bem, tá bem. - Mande entrar o Sargento Fulton. - Imediatamente, senhor. Pode entrar, soldado. - Sargento, pra você. - Não estaria tão seguro. Onde já se viu? - Sargento Fulton se apresentando, senhor. - Ah, sim, Fulton. - Já falo com você. - Sim, senhor. - Já deve saber por que o chamei. - Não faço a menor ideia, senhor. Não me diga que já esqueceu das manobras, Sargento. Então ainda sou sargento... senhor? Acho que o coronel tem algo a dizer a esse respeito. Tenho aqui um memorando dele referente a você. O que ele diz, senhor? "Em face da ação do Sargento Ronald Ful... Ronald Fulton, é você, não é, Ronald? Sim, sou eu, senhor. Tenente Carruthers falando. Sim, Major? Sim, Major. Tratarei disso amanhã assim que chegar. Vejamos, onde estávamos? - O Coronel ia tratar do meu caso. - Ah, sim... "Em face da ação do Sargento Fulton nas recentes manobras... Com licença, mas o intendente pediu que assinasse isto imediatamente. Ah, sim. - Toma. - Obrigado, senhor. Estava falando da minha ação nas recentes manobras... Sim..."Em face da ação do Sargento Fulton nas recentes manobras, em virtude do desembaraço demonstrado, ...recomendo que seja colocado na lista de candidatos ao curso de oficialato." Bem, acho que era de se esperar, embora eu... Ei, espera aí! Sou eu! Vou entrar pro curso!
